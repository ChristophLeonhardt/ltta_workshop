goldmine yeah like so much sense of the
Greyjoy's had greyscale there's a great
there's every picture you're on before
and you're unknown and the caption was
Dragonstone has its own intro now
donut I've read some stuff in predicting
some very Lovecraftian type stuff coming
up around okay

what pipe or stuff about what as also is
well that and some some theories that
actually the white walkers are finding
something even worse that's great

the great story and elector knew right
though they're getting ready to fight

wider air walkers are coming the Klan
the whitest water the white walkers are

record that John and I accidentally wore
the same shirt yes there's a moon
there's a moon somebody find the
original article I was referring to
there was there was good reason
that's trying stone there we go
you know I figured it out sorry dragons
made of stone Selena I would not have
known where we work see when they show
you here tonight so this is Daenerys
you came into the world I remember that
all the dogs in King's Landing howled
through the night I always would be a
homecoming doesn't feel like many we
won't spend Dragonstone for it
not so many lions
thirsty controls fewer than half the
Seven Kingdoms the Lords of Westeros
despiser even before your arrival they
plotted against them now they go out for
their true clean their drink secret
toasts to my health
maybe we used to tell my brother that
sort of thing was stupid enough to
believe but Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back
he'd have invaded things landing already
mysterious would be easy for you but
you're not here to be queen of the ashes
no we can take the Seven Kingdoms
without turning it into a slaughterhouse
if the Great Houses hold you're playing
against Cersei here's one
the Tyrell Army and the Dornish on our
side they joined defied my claim because
they believe in you you said my father
didn't universe I did you served my
father I had to chose different serves
Robert Baratheon also sometimes act
you said we know you turned against
Robert was an improvement on your father
to be sure there have been few rulers in
history as cruel as the Mad King Robert
was neither mad nor cruel he simply had
no interest in being capable so you took
it upon yourself on the bathroom your
grace but when I was ready to drink
myself into a small coffin Lord Zheng
has told me that a queen before I came
to spines did they tell you miss arias
was stupid only with those qualities
have made for a good King until your
marriage to Carly Drogo in your grace I
knew nothing about him save your
existence and that you were set to be
beautiful so you and your friends
treated me like a prized horse to the
dragon which you turn to your advantage
in Robin well hide the assassins yes
imagine Aerys Targaryen Greece I did
what had to be done to keep yourself
alive
proven in stuff loyal quite the opposite
if he dislikes one more it inspires to
crown the next one what kind of servant
is that the kind the realm needs
incompetence should not be rewarded with
blind loyalty as long as I had my eyes
I'll use them I wasn't born into a great
house I came from nothing I was sold as
a slave carved up as an offering when I
was a child I lived in alleys gutters
abandoned houses you wish to know what
my true loyalties lie
and with any king or queen but with the
people the people who suffer on the
despots and prosper under just rule the
people whose hearts you aim to win if
you demand blind allegiance and respect
your wishes pray one can behead me or
your dragons can devour me but if you
let me live I will serve you well I will
dedicate
myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne
because I choose you because I know that
people have no better chance than you
get it up swear it if you ever think I'm
saying the people you won't conspired
behind my back
you look me in the eye as you have done
today will tell me how I'm thinking I
swear in my cream you have to get out
see that serious thanks guys
nothing less
oh here we go
the one character that was missing from
my lesson which read precesses yeah in a
preview they said how was it her reclose
said Belmonts memory leaks misread that
one valence he sealed registers your
dance score of such a Mele project Mary
Sam Rosa Bravo six
she once served another who wanted the
Iron Throne it didn't end well for
Stannis Baratheon didn't know didn't you
Joe he's no suspicious day to another
dragons tournament we've just decided to
pardon those who once served the wrong
yes but even those who don't worship the
Lord in service cars what does your not
expect from me Moses Bundy's Amazon's
Mary give your doll Elias was mahakal
contents the princess promised will
bring the door I'm afraid I'm not a
prince your grace forgive me but your
translation is not quite accurate
Sebastian has
oh I believe you have another king in
the north
Jon Snow Lord Commander of the Nights
Watch he allowed the wildlings south of
the wall to protect them from great
danger as king in the north
he has United those wildlings with the
northern houses so together they may
face their common enemy he sounds like
quite a man
someone Johnson and I'm stand before you
and tell you the things that happened to
him
the thing is very soon you will noise I
can't speak to prophecies or visions and
the flames
I like Jon Snow and I trusted him
diamond excellent for this character
the Lannisters execute his father and
conspired to murder his birth Jon Snow
has even more reason to hit ceci than
you do send a raven north tell Jon Snow
that his Queen invites him to come to
Dresden don't do that that's a bad idea
that's just gonna create more tension
for in that hoop a happens yeah
she just really turn could be someone
trying to go into a trap
read the last bit will divorce a
bastards in their father's eyes what
does that mean something he said to me
the first night we met you know him
better than any of us what do you think
Turing's not like the other lionesses
there's always kind to me but it's the
greater risk Seven Kingdoms will bleed
longer so she sits on the Iron Throne
join us together we can end her tyranny
something firmer casual mention of a
Dothraki horde or even three dragons
what breathes fire dragons no but but if
the army of the Dead makes it past the
wall do we have enough men the Franklin
if the maddest way the realm as we know
it some of you are bannermen of house
Tyrell but House Tyrell is an open
rebellion against the crown with their
help the mayor odor has buried an army
of savages to our shores
mindless on the solid soldiers who will
destroy your castles Dothraki heathens
who will burn your villages rape and
enslave the women and butcher your
children without a second thought this
is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries
of service and loyalty until Steve Banda
the Mad King his daughter is no
different in Essos her brutality is
already legendary she crucified hundreds
when she
it is my solemn duty to protect the
people and I will but I need your help
my once we must stand together all of us
if we hope to stop her she has three
full-grown dragon okay finally here same
as ago
he conquered the Seven Kingdoms I
propose we apparently work on a solution
golden dome dragons can't get in really
big about dragons underneath
we're gonna keep what did she could like
reanimate nice dead trains Queens and
I've heard what she does to those whose
is fine he's well dressed
you ride from Wallkill today I have an
all-native mobilize the long before the
fledglings belt and which side will you
be fighting form for the only man to
defeat Robert Baratheon in battle or
even Rhaegar Targaryen it's a long ride
only aye sir
I want you to be my ranking general I'm
a Tarly it may mean something when I'm
scheming burnstead our rivals Rebecca
those winnings I swore an oath the
halftime is one of the clouds no one
ever was a great woman
once now she wants revenge
Frankie to our shores
they don't threat in western US for the
first time in this bad jammies battery
don't make my sister make a choice he'll
do the right thing with my finest
scientists when the worst one the Queen
will be the south and Randolph sorry
the infection is spread too far you
should have cut off your arm remembered
you a touch long years before it kills
you
10 20 but how long until your mind six
months
you're lying
no mr. Chris aminoacylation
immediately this is quite advanced and
beyond our skills bring on Commodore and
have you shipped the veneer here at once
to the doctor of life of the stone men
as an appointed night one more day oh
you choose to spend that time is up to
you come son
should we send where to your family's
there joram joram on moment there's no
need I've been dead to them for years
yeah come on
I think it's apparently one of the
nervousness dragons was wounded by sin
the wounded
because you go like this
don't destroy the old dragons that's not
cool
Taliban that's the secret weapon yeah if
you had a hundred maybe within a day we
turn the Dragons news
tens of thousands will die in the fire
spell it's you don't have the stomach
for it
scurry back into hiding I know how you
wait we don't poison little girls here
there are no innocent Lannister's my
greatest regret is that overing died
fighting for nothing up Tyrion is hand
of the Queen which I respect whatever I
am NOT here to be queen of the ashes
nice to hear of course I can't remember
my granddaughter the common people loved
her but no what is left now ashes
commoners no they weren't of age and
that's the feeling I'm grateful to you
lady alone with New York Council and
grateful to all of you but you have
chosen to follow me I will not attack
Kings Daniel we will not attack King's
Landing then how do you mean to take the
Iron Throne by asking nicely
we will accede to the capital
surrounding the city on all sides
firstly we'll have the Iron Throne but
no food for her army or the people but
we won't use Dothraki and unfurling the
supercharger rally the Lords of Westeros
by appealing to the Lord their love for
their country
it seems the city performance we prove
the point
our army should be Westeros I suppose
we're providing the Westerosi you are
lady Greyjoy will escort you home son
and her iron feet with very the Dornish
on me back up to King's Landing yes
without the bullish will they siege to
the capital alongside the Tyrell Army
two great kingdoms United again says so
your master plan is to use our armies
for asking it's costing Iran very well
in the unsullied or stairs of the rock
there is a problem with this plan yeah
doing this with you is you're obviously
the smartest person you think that's
what we had under your father or his
father or his piece number versus my
devil would you take a bit of advice
from another woman he's a clever man
I'm your hand I've known a great many
men I know why I think James the Lords
of Westeros as she is you know you're a
dragon being a dragon what did she do to
click a clever man she ignored that she
outlived them oh yeah and she said she
watching oh that's cold
it's hard for me to say goodbye to me
why no way
I don't why my witness
when I'm sorry that young the Masters on
deaf ears one boy is scared of dogs
one boy hates high places one is
frightened of the ocean they make the
boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff
they draw him in the water if he learns
to swim good he drowns good either way
Roman sorry I had nothing else I was
never the biggest you know the strongest
I was playing always and he continued I
meet missandei from the island ah now I
have fear

you and he said rape if she just started
laughing
an effort to be non-sexist I'll say he
also is an excellent ass
so they just got the balls but it's
great
literally all 16 million people watching
have no idea right now yeah everyone's
asking the exact same I thought did me
what is then I want to see the outtake
where she says Jesus how long was it
before they cut it they had to leave the
penis but then actually a lot of her
advisors there also do it I don't think
so Khaleesi who's reading - Kelis this
is Richard - Richard she touches that
paper
good news smell the rum the first
reference to Roman that's worth did he
say rum yes Jesus
you know what's gonna be irritating is
that he takes his own shirt off a hug
what's my ear Janie's we're not gonna
get to see what we're gonna watch him
pick off every one of these guys yeah
screaming there we go
you ever done this before I think you

bold man that's the good part
come on yeah come on the boobs didn't
give birth to come in the room
fucking Shepherd's pies are in for me
secret you've been making pie which is
it what are you
that's pretty good a good thousand yard
stare

he got him she is still like 13 she
seemed so sure she should both weigh
edge why don't we know but she blew up
the great set there must be something to
see
what you building for Winterfell what
don't smoke that and console black in
the world anomaly and wonder batter the
bastard he's king of the north man stole
my job huh your brother right
I can't eat this he froze my pain
I'm leaving for Europe boy pretty I
really thought she was still gonna go I
think she is still don't take the King's
Landing
ya know well your hope you guys are
point was that she would that she's a
different person that she's driven
focused like you just quits in one
second I just say things
no no I think we were wrong all right
because we thought sure she didn't know
yeah I did think she already knew
yeah she had known we had she literally
has to decide now cuz that's the
crossroads in like heads to vote that's
amazing that you know which direction
goes away
well because there's the mountain the
one way that so she's alone on
Winterfell would she meet stuffs no
that's gonna be awesome
what would have been more awesome as it
could kill Cersei he's gonna kill it we
got two more seasons this was sent to me
by Sam well he was my brother a man as
anyone in this world
on a mountain of a few days ago
bend the knees for a more importantly we
need a lot the night king's army grows
larger by the day we can't defeat them
on our own we don't have the numbers
Daenerys has her own army and she has
Dragon Fire I need to try and persuade
her to fight with us the Davos and I
will ride the white Harbor tomorrow then
sail for Dragonstone he's forgotten what
happened to our grandfather the Mad King
invited him to King's Landing
sit him alive she is here to reclaim the
iron throne and the Seven Kingdoms the
North is one of those Seven Kingdoms
this isn't an invitation it's a trap
they could be but I don't believe Tyrion
would do that
you know he's a good man he's talking to
we called your brother King and then he
lost Kingdom Wednesday's here's your
grace
we need King in the north
the north good points
don't send Sansa and Littlefinger you
all crowned in your king I never wanted
it I never asked for it but I accepted
it because the north is my home it's
part of me and I will never stop
fighting for it no matter the odds the
odds are against us none of you have
seen the army of the Dead
none of you we can never hope to defeat
them alone we need allies powerful
allies I know it's a risk but I have to
take an emissary don't go yourself
Daenerys is acquitted on making convince
her to help you what did you say you
know she only stalking me until I return
the north is your
I fuckin love this show he's like oh oh
he's gonna start picking away at her no
the problem is now little fingers
assassinate him on the road don't do
that
so to me finish what do you say touch
her
touch my sister I'll kill you myself
yeah oh no he's definitely gonna try to
kill that's not gonna make him do it
yeah that's right that's right yeah he
said say hi to tyrion tyrion has to
remember that little finger try to frame
him for the murder of Lance no no no no
I loved you I loved your sister as I
loved her mother you think that's gonna
win you points with people no no I'll
pretty much take anything else dark at
this point
oh if Aria gets back here it's on yeah
no no that was meant a antagonizing on
the road it's the same road oh maybe
yeah so are you killed I can marry her
and be king and they're not Aria we'll
see through this instantly I'll be like
science it's so great to know this yeah
yeah oh yeah yeah little finger
you know we think there's some chance of
some sweetness that's true but she might
touch up to the hell out wait watching
the walkers oh yeah I think the what the
wolf yeah as it wasn't a tracking her
for drove it off nightmare yeah wait why
is it a bad thing
that's not a bad thing that's our horse
or so no that wouldn't be the first time
anyone's been cold nobody it gets cold
before the walkers from I yeah but it's
or three fucking cold
in the first illness by 12 okay there
wolf walkers right Nymeria it's got her
own patent nice
hello holy shit
nothing is huge my god she could run she
can ride I'm heading north go back to
inspire I finally going home
come with me
don't worry these usually it's not you
it's me
my queen demands my advisor my protector
Oh protector so if someone gets too
close to you you might have to intervene
understanding on the way over there
foreign invasions Oh kissing her the
better nation you're on yep
this is why it was a bad idea remember
what I said was a bad idea
they split up the army and it allows for
Euron to attack them when they're weak
they're all the armies they should have
kept all the armies together I would
have made a better Queen
Oh
you're
it's Jax
of shit Kewell who needs a hoody just
crush something a personal dilemma
oh shit
Oh anyone literally didn't know who to
kill that is every war more than 40
years old ago really great it's the
great joy they're all wearing the same
stone I always thought that Braveheart
they all have a beard just kill everyone
who's pointing a weapon at you oh shit
maybe he runs this there for her maybe
that's the gift she did kill herself
after all yeah but he couldn't have
known that they were gonna travel that
way well he's a pirate so he's looking
out for
did he just kill nothing no no yes I
think so yeah no that was down below
deck that's blood oh oh oh shit doesn't
work
No
Oh
Oh No exactly see how he dies here and
she's gonna yeah it's a good chance
Dan's supposed to be her protector but
he can't die mmm she's gonna run out of
nearby friends any of these guys fight
they're still
these are the only three people left on
the book
yep oh my god that's too bad that's the
battle is over that's one of the
daughters right those are the two that
he killed I think I go but I don't think
he killed her no she's not
no day's the two daughters yeah that
sucks
oh damn that's that damn okay
so guys here's situation we're going to
take a small break and then we're to
come back and do the review don't go
anywhere because I have a thousand
things to say one of which is I knew it
all right down to that done okay
you
all right we are back on Game of Thrones
review what's the season 7 episode 2 yep
okay now 9 episode 20 okay it's fine bye
I wish from your mouth to God's ears or
Lord of Light ears yes so uh that was an
episode boy we had a nice ending there
that was game with Rhodes nice well we
had it we had a hell of an ending let's
put it that way yes John and I did
accidentally wear the same shirt are you
ok house TYT yes that's why I wear
Hawaiian shirts all the time so that
shit doesn't happen next time we'll come
on in a Hawaiian shirt shop TYT dot-com
yeah so what are we gonna are we gonna
take a look at the preview yet does that
that's the answer that's later alright
so let's all let's start backwards a
little bit so let's talk about the
momentum Greyjoy versus a Greyjoy the
battle yeah right I think the episodes
name was great joy and great joy crying
nobody talks about it ok release the
Kraken no that's it was literally yeah
release the graphic yeah I first of all
I'm I'm totally curious how anyone in
that battle knew who to kill I mean they
just thought onto the boat and then
there's all swinging and they're all
turning around I mean it's easier to
figure out what boat to fire on yeah
what's your on the boat well maybe it
you know all your buddies and if you
don't recognize somebody that they know
but in this case it's it's dark rage or
raining so they are all wearing the same
things they look and they all used to be
buddies but the boarding party is
probably less than like two dozen men
you theoretically would recognize their
faces like yes I don't think you kill a
lot of friends in these okay look if the
four of us jumped into another boat and
started swinging axes and I turn around
and I see jank
I'm probably not gonna keep swinging but
if you turn around and you see five guys
with beards but look exactly like John I
had all thought it'd be like John your
brothers are here that example
in the worst case scenario you killed
John right the bastards
I mean everybody looks alike like
they're like kind of good money
but here we go but breathe but I'm just
saying presuming that you have some
insight there into the difference in the
Battle of the bastards between the
Bolton's and the John's army over that
whether the Nights Watch guy they're
wearing different here they're they're
all graduates in the battle bodies are
covered mud you can't say that's okay
it's okay so let's get under the most of
course up which is that that was Game of
Thrones so that that's a serious ass
battle right there that's no joking
around and nice entrance from there on
plans go seriously sideways yes
something goes terribly wrong for
Daenerys this plan yeah well so let us
note for the record that as we were
watching live which is what we're doing
now we watch live and then do the review
right afterwards check out all this on
youtube.com slash what the flick show
all the reviews were there anyway I said
when she explained the plan to get right
to everybody I said it's a bad idea and
I thought was that if you split up the
army each part is weaker and we know
that your on was out there so it allows
your on to pick them all but sail down
there and then sail back come on Dornish
army and everything's gonna be fine and
then they'll yeah but they but the
Greyjoy's no I mean because she's talked
about she had talked about their uncle
needing to be taken care of they know
that he's out there with that fleet
somewhere yeah he's somewhere they
should have considered that a little bit
better but more so than that it's just a
you have a killer badass gigantic army
it I'll give you a perfect example once
I'm playing blackjack with a guy who's
got two tens he asked the dealer should
I split him she said son if you had a
10-inch cock would you split it okay and
so if you've got a nice piece don't
split it
just take the win this thing bow down to
King's Landing blow them away by any
means necessary
yeah the Dragons they won't kill tens of
thousands
innocent people don't kill tens of
hundreds this is not the real world it's
Game of Thrones real world so your lady
ate some good point you're with Lady
Elana right and you're not Syrian and
not Tyrion you're like oh go ahead be be
queen of the ashes not not queen of the
hashes they're overdoing it everybody
hates Cersei there's a better way to to
attack the kingdom this split in your
okay but seriously pointed out correctly
that she can rally the nobles around
don't let that Dothraki horde don't let
those foreigners come in and sully
they're going to give Castle Rock anyway
that's also part of the kingdom if you
weren't getting the Dornish then you
wouldn't be so even though you're being
inconsistent
I've we've caught you in a logic no but
if they if you if they do what you want
and just go get Cersei with your huge
badass army that's the unsullied then
you're the plan yeah was to send the
unsullied to cash Lear on yourself no my
point is that you're sending the
unsullied to Casterly Rock
anyway so so nobody no let me finish the
thought which is invading with the
unsullied and Westeros that ship has
sailed who gives a shit it's like so
you're not the Tully's they're not gonna
be like well it was only cast Laurie
rocks so it doesn't really count they're
not really foreigners no the foreigners
are already invading all over Westeros
that ship has sailed
keep the army in one place can crush
them so it was a terrible mistake
except that there's a good chance that
if Tyrion goes with the unsullied to
take Casterly Rock he can say as a
Lannister I needed these guys to take my
cows these are all BS are you miss
poweris power okay you wanna you wanna
Ann Coulter it nuke the Mideast you got
the weapons nuke it they jerk no no no
okay so no what I'm saying is once you
okay you want to do a siege
fine do a siege do it with your whole
army okay so and and when you have the
whole army there you have a lot of other
options and they're not gonna mess with
your whole army so you're like okay you
go take the Tully's now you're I want
why did I do that why it's an even match
that's a stupid idea
so now was it how were the Dornish ever
gonna get into the battle if they
apparently needed they need apparently
they don't have any ships in Dorne keep
the whole army there go to King's
Landing and then you see if you want you
should keep have the unsullied and the
Dothraki do the the this procedure or
whatever where you're standing on side
send the other guys in but at least
you've got your ships there to
protecting you about the dragons there
to protect you so that you don't get
ambushed so it's a great point like I
mean I get that I'm gonna get mocked for
pointing out that one time never matters
in the show and like like how long is it
gonna take for Jon to get there how did
your on you build his ships in that much
time now do they randomly run into each
other in the middle of frickin ocean but
you are allowed to literally nitpick
like your general mcarthur going on like
any like it's all may not picking that
is the core of the strategy that's not
like well there's no strategy ever you
just get your big armies roll through
she's trying to rule she was too worried
about lions they want they want a legacy
that isn't what what what Lady olanna
said which was that a band is just you
come in and there's never any peace she
wants sort of a lasting actual game
alliances I hear you last thing on this
is that I'm not saying burn everyone
when you get to King's Landing I'm
saying keep the army together and then
when you get there okay you've got
you've laid siege to it they're trapped
so if the Tully's or anyone else comes
the the mothership is there you are
prepared for them and so as they are
getting hungry and desperate in King's
Landing
somebody's gonna hand you Cersei anyway
or you send in varus's spiders you think
you don't just you know it's not like
I'm telling you burn the place down I
got you this is they so your point is
they over thought this yellow to
mentally disagree that using a foreign
army to circle the capital of the entire
thing could drive people to go with
Cersei it doesn't matter it doesn't
matter they think it matters no but it
doesn't matter if it does because those
armies are are with Cersei to begin with
right now
and they're not enough they're not
enough okay they don't know that so and
if you go to King's Landing those armies
are gonna what coming join the battle
look it's Game of Thrones they're gonna
join the battle no matter what and to me
it look like they'll know they're on the
show like I'm saying that's the context
in the in this context they're gonna
fight and so this is the idea that well
technically we didn't use the unsullied
in the Dothraki to take the capital is
not a winning argument anyway or arguing
that this is a flaw in her thinking
militarily general or are you arguing
that this is a narrative flaw that they
don't do what I mean to me no no the
narrative is fantastic the way that it
played out was wonderful the having I'm
arguing with Daenerys yeah I would have
made a better Queen I might still get
your chance the issue I have with it is
he said you know I'm gonna I'm gonna
bring you back a gift or whatever and I
I thought I had a clever idea about what
it is and apparently I've been proven
wrong so okay maybe he's waiting outside
a dragon what's up just like them out
something like that maybe he's waiting
outside a dragon's tongue waiting for
the fleet to move and he'll attack at
regardless of who it is but he attacked
that ship takes an exact person prisoner
that I don't see how he could have
possibly known that she would be on the
ship or with the Armada that bothers
hear it exactly I guess so yeah right so
he would have turns out that they've
addendum that the the sands thanks a lot
again it goes to the how could you
possibly know that that and I have no
problem asking that question that works
a lot because when they they know and
don't know just completely conveniently
and in this case it was convenient that
he know so he's bringing back both lady
Greyjoy I think I made that name up that
were they call her its are Yara
uh uh uh missus they bring back missus
Greyjoy sister Greyjoy by the way I have
all their albums they're great sister
bring back sister Greyjoy and
and mrs. Dorn mrs. Doran and also
coolest daughter of mrs. Dorn the one
that I was like the one that was
flirting with alright they have one they
didn't show her dying I don't fail
theoretically we have three ladies yeah
coming back to sirs and perhaps Theon
following in their way well she was on
that he's holding on to that thing and
like he says kick it he starts kicking
you never know yeah he's a Greyjoy and
he's pretty aerodynamic down below if
you know what I mean yeah this relevant
characters don't randomly drown in the
middle of the ocean demons ending back
to reek again yes the reason is he
already did that with Sansa if you
remember that too much to do it twice
like I was he had remember once I was
kidding I mean I said live he's gonna
panic run away and jump in the sea and
then he did wasn't it a good call though
it was if he had taken a step towards
her there goes her neck and she's dead
now she's alive it was it was the right
call to make and and and in no other
show would have jumped in the water
that's why we love this show through and
so and look I thought if I remember
right and you guys can look at our first
review on youtube.com slash what the
flood show did I mention that I gift
would be the Miss thorne right but it
didn't have to be he goes after the
ships cuz he wants to knock out their
fleet that's already a gift he uses yeah
but the IFTA he gets his niece that's
already a gift it turns out he got a
three-fer and it could it could have
been Tyrion there have been someone else
yeah you're right there's a specific
question but do you think that Iran's
arrival and killing mrs. Dorn's two
daughters do you think that's gonna kill
the moment between mrs. Doran and lady
Greyjoy or you think like they're right
back yeah it's too bad because it came
the the the attack came right after a
great look from late you know we're so
as what am I gonna go
yeah as we watch this live my only
regret is that we can't talk more
because I'm trying we're all trying to
hear right but as soon as I saw the seed
beginning I was like they're gonna come
cuz they're both bye and since that
starts to look like her odds gonna be
there any second right don't kiss him
don't you two don't kiss each other cuz
then her own shop and ruin it all all so
much kisses people they die I also I
mean look it was a great it was great to
see another battle scene I don't think
we've seen a full naval on naval battle
scene so that was cool but also I
thought that it was important that they
finally provide some reason to fear
Euron and think that he's that's
impressive or scary in any way that's
right because what has he done
previously through an old man off a
bridge yeah we don't had the descending
thing he's really fighting he's the
first person on the boat if you want to
make someone scared of a pirate that's
how you don't know it's totally right we
we we he came out of nowhere
we'd never I if you haven't read the
books you don't even know this guy is
this all of a sudden he comes he kills
his brother and then he's supposedly a
real threat and he says things like you
know when they when they when they get
away from him and leave with the fleas
like well we'll just build both ships
and I'm like how are you gonna build
enough ships well it turns out he's a
serious military leader even though you
know and so I think it was he at one
point dead no no they just thought he
was they they really they haven't gone
nearly yeah he's he exiled after the
rebellion they did they did drown him
that's what they always do right they
crown their king
but in the books there's more
information about a lot of the Greyjoy's
several the brothers but for him
specifically he was very different in
the books he had been basically
everywhere he had sailed the places for
years that no one had ever gone to
before he had a ship that with every
inch of it was black including the sails
and a crew of people who were all mutes
he had these weird magic items kind of
and so he was interesting and different
on the show up until tonight he was just
some dude I guess alright so but it was
good that we now know him that he's
serious and to be feared and he said guy
to be taken seriously in this game yeah
I mean I think we see before the end of
the season he ends up Mary
circe probably no it's certainly how
it's going and and and narrative Lee
it's one great because it's a great
battle it's unexpected it it and and
most importantly now the odds are a
little bit more even before it was kind
of uninteresting stirs he had everything
right and and all I'm so not sorry sorry
Daenerys had everything and Cersei had
like three Shou Shou kingdoms left on
our side and okay well you just knocked
out the Dorn's and the Greyjoy's or what
was left over Georgia and you may have
the Greyjoy fleet now totally do we
assume that the fleet is just gone I
don't know a thing well yeah powerful
half of the yeah so so I was I thought
there were signs and I've always looked
for these signs like I'm curious what
you guys think about whether Daenerys
like you think cuz she made a mistake
just in the planning stages following
Tyrians advice in the battle as you just
talked about but also like you know the
way she challenged Varys suggests that
does she not understand Varys is value
and I know you were big on varus's value
so yeah she came around at the right
decision there but then she ends that
conversation with Varys by saying you
know betray me again and I'll burn you
alive right you know like that's a
that's what her lunatic father did right
she's got to show some Authority maybe
okay I'm just saying there were there
are some signs that you know we keep
thinking she's this perfect Savior she
might not be
she might be flawed she has had moments
here again you know Tyrion had
legitimate things for he was like no not
don't don't so what was she doing there
with just us but yeah there's reason to
fear him I think no that didn't bother
me I mean it bothered me because there
was some percentage chance that Varys
was going to die right then and there
and I love Varys he's my favorite
character but as he is prone to do he
talked himself out of it and one of the
reasons why I love but she's very well
look at her you know coming in I mean
again like we see a lot of stuff we have
the advantage of seeing a lot of the
stuff that the characters themselves
don't see right so on the face of it she
is somebody like Varys and she as she's
going through his history
she has to ask like okay great
you've done all this for me but you were
doing stuff for Robert you were getting
stuff for my dad like what the fuck dude
and his answer is probably the best
answer and she says okay sure I'll buy
that but cross me and you're burned
alive motherfucker yeah like that's I
don't mind that conversation at all it's
a perfectly logical conversation cuz
she's right he is literally the one who
sent the assassins to kill her so I
think God asked you I'd ask a couple of
questions don't burn you alive in the
same I was gonna say same eBay hell I'll
burn you alive in the same in the stream
episode you basically but her emails in
for Gary Lea I'll burn you alive along
with bend the knee to Jon like like I'm
telling you no no that's a super fair
well I think both yeah
that's a it could be forgiven more yes
if she turned yeah but she's not coming
back to share a kingdom she was coming
back to be on the iron throne in charge
of the Seven Kingdoms right yes guys
coming from up north like yeah his two
and she doesn't know and to your tour
the overall question that because John
has stayed remarkably consistent like if
he were ever to get to the iron tone
where he'd be like I don't really want
it but alright you guys I get it so be
but he would still want to unite
everybody and he'd have to execute
everybody himself you know and she maybe
is be you know at some point she may
make a break which is the break of great
ruler in this world has to make which is
yet look man I'm I'm gonna be as fair as
I can be but what I have to be unfair
it's gonna be awful for you well and I
think what they needed to do was provide
that potential breaking point like as
long as she had all the advantages it's
easy to be the good queen so let's so
once it's tough so let's see what yes
now like it you know but and she got the
advice from from Lady Olenna that's true
the thing is ruthless we're talking
about this strategy stuff I don't know
why you guys think that she has a chance
they've got big crossbows those dragons
are going down
an effect like the whole thing is done
as a mere said those things are gonna
work radon drivers like these are this
is their big thing larger crossbows to
get the Dragons worked on smog and then
but Amir pointed out if the dragons just
lie there and stay perfectly still
you get him while they're sleeping that
big that Darrow could do sir but we know
how TV works one of the Dragons is
getting killed by that thing right
check-offs ballista so so yeah I was
unimpressed - I was hoping for some
magic relay like a series this series
Sesame Street blood coming back from the
dead but you had all the skulls I'm
thinking like oh we're gonna see like
skeleton dragons like undead dragon
skeletons yeah dracolich now but but
that those crossbows lead to white
Walker dragon so you see what I'm saying
that's what makes it interesting so the
crossbows get one of the dragons he
turns becomes a white Walker and now
we're having fun yeah so now all the
same fine but the closest we're watching
it is when they use the crossbow on the
old skeleton yeah and destroy like one
of the greatest things in the kingdoms
what kind of Taliban are you yeah he's a
disrespectful he's the Grandmaster now
or theoretically or whatever he is the
hand of the Queen so oh yeah so I'll sit
in that opening scene with the speaking
of dragons with like that map that as we
opens with Daenerys at them we using the
you know at the map there somebody had
to like mold those little dragons like
so I just what is there an order go out
like listen we need a big map we got to
lay things out we need three dragons one
slightly larger than the other two
we need them Thursday get on it yeah yes
that is absolutely what happens but
that's funny erection that so my tiny
point was she now has a dragon pen
dinner yeah I'm like that doesn't next
next episode look for it and like it's a
little out of place
I am I again I
in here I think Daenerys in some way is
gonna let us down
so bad Jamie uh was back right not
talking to uh I think there was just
some good strategizing you know he's
there he's looking to win he's also
gonna lose yeah and he didn't do
anything particularly Evo it was just
good stress I got you but like
threatened him really I mean like yes
it's good strategy but less control but
I mean he they they all you know he
sounded like a Steve Bannon you know I
mean like foreigners are coming to our
shores and they're not like like I mean
it's you know I mean it I mean it's
racism it's you know these what's his
alternatives like whoa whoa but anyway
it's just I hate you know you character
you grow to inexplicably like with Jamie
I mean again we've talked about it every
everything or often that's incredible
rehabilitation of Jamie to that point I
was making last week that somehow we're
like we let Jamie off the hook but but
sir she is still the definition of evil
I think it's a worthy conversation but I
get it I agree
but here he was you know again rallying
us to hate people because they're
different I'm just saying that's my it's
not like he was not noble and right this
was a so what do we want to see like
what what does good Jamie do kill Cersei
kill Cersei for a long time yes not you
know he has to support her until then
for it to be dramatically satisfy think
there's a good chance that that that's
how sir she does like I think there's a
solid chance that it's by Jamie's hand
yeah but it's too early old one yeah we
should so I think Aria I think Ari is
gonna kill her
well she's no down and lobby whether
you'd get permanently they can't turn
around there's no horse that goes there
maybe y'all come get him their horses
are all one way so that's to my tier
over all right or salary
you'd have to take only mariya back down
south but tear to your overall point
though they did it again miss Dorne is
it a really bad guy ish and I you know
killing the kid and all that stuff and I
was rooting for her in that battle I'm
like how did you get me to root for them
in that band ladies are doors right so
and not killing mrs. Dorne when you have
the opportunity to kill her missus and
it's probably seeing a terrible idea
yeah sandy well no but that's such a
great gift a source of kisser she is
going to yeah but she won't like show
we're not like out of that we're not I
don't think great it's nothing I think
she'll give him give her to the mountain
the way she gave that other Shane no no
but she again that would be the plan and
maybe it'll work but I just don't think
we set up oh we caught you as a we
kidnapping you we're taking you back
because we're gonna give you to Cersei
so she can kill you slowly and brutally
and then Cersei kills her brutally and
slowly like now they've telegraphed it
yeah now something different now okay
let me read you know I love these
predictions in this rare case I think
that's exactly what happens they bring
her to Cersei there's no further twist
and she just murders that why did they
lure the otter - oh then the daughter
gets it and she gets away mrs. Doran has
to watch mrs. Doran mrs. Doran is a
survivor all right what about so I so I
bet yeah so should we I was gonna say
should we talk about Jon Snow I think
Jon Snow actually will he'll help be
willing to bend the knee I think yeah
sure yeah yeah well you don't go if
you're not gonna bend she's going but
yeah because Daenerys will say you want
the dragon stone you want all the stuff
you gotta bend the knee and be like all
right yeah Jon Jon doesn't care about
the Iron Throne
John just wants everybody to live so
he's like yeah you're gonna get me the
dragonglass
and you've got the Dragons and we're all
together we're yeah yeah okay yeah it's
a deal
let's go unless he gets killed in which
case Petyr Baelish is gonna make himself
king of the north right yes so that so
that's the most interesting part of it
right so he says I'm going down south
and little fingers like like that was
like that scanner on the phone and tell
him what yes right it was weird that
they accidentally cut to a shot of
Baelish right then yeah we're tightening
for so I knew he was gonna leave sausage
but that's not exact yeah and and so now
the biggest risk to the entire kingdom
yet it is Littlefinger assassinating
just know on the way there I can't wait
so final scene in this whole show is
gonna be Varys and Petyr Baelish
physically fighting aggressively over
the chair that's what it's gonna be more
like or worse is that is that Baelish is
that little figures on the throne
embarrasses his hand and this was their
plan talked about this either in the
preview or intro maestro in the first
review of Littlefinger wins Varys is for
order he would serve Him versus versus
for a people who serves the population
very same of Bernie Sanders speech here
right Sanders Sanders 2020 there's a 79
percent a hundred nine but but they
stand for two different ways of ruling
so that to me this yeah there are two
different ideas yeah right the it was
just I wants to burn it all down so look
yeah now that Baelish yeah helped a
brother out in battle of the bastards
and it doesn't like he will never be
better than this right so he's done his
only good deed this is the time to
murder it wasn't it was it was all it's
part of strategy
of course of course but it wound up
helping you if Jon Snow was
appropriately ruthless he'd be like a
little finger excuse me sorry he's like
oh that's such a good point about how
you wanted to have sex with my stepmom
and and my sister that wasn't creepy at
all notion that somebody could come up
to me and be like I loved your wife and
I'll love your daughter just as I loved
your wife geez I don't think so I loved
her chin like you but I mean the idea
that like yeah I'm gonna get the mom and
the daughter like right so you got my
trial right so yeah well I think what he
was trying to do there it's not clear in
that episode is that he was trying to
attack maybe you so when John gets him
by the throat but didn't Ned do that to
him like first season I think I did the
same thing he was choking but this will
end well for that if you start choking
Littlefinger finish it yeah finishes you
at any given time if you wanted to you
could kill him I wrote yeah he should
kill Littlefinger right now yeah yeah
see you son so okay
she will I don't think she'll do it
narrative Lea etc but if sasha is now
ruthless which is what we know think she
you know that's what she said just here
take a gun kill him I kind of like dr.
evil son well it was right there and Jon
Snow his left right she rules the north
she can make all of it I just want to
catch a guy okay powers power but that
doesn't work though right because if
Littlefinger gets killed all of his
forces from the Eyrie disappear what
they no no no you play hard you think he
was in charge you go to his number three
not to his number two you go to his
number three you make a deal and then
you kill him in the number two at the
same time when Rob killed the Karstarks
he lost half his army mm-hmm
yeah that's true it's possible if I
start killing your bannermen just
because they're skeevy but I you
certainly
I wouldn't do it in public right hide
little finger little finger but anyway
they're not going to lose following
little thing I mean in a sense his
brilliance is that I can't imagine one
soldier anywhere being like hey man
wherever you say that's where I am yeah
boss you know well there is a very rigid
hierarchy the house is in charge of the
Vale you got it but then you should
respect that very retiring day like him
and Daenerys yeah
in Daenerys is plain the thing is with
the constraints that we have now that's
possible with the seasons being shorter
and travel being faster they don't
travel for a whole season anymore I
think that we can assume that whatever
is gonna happen up there with
Littlefinger might well happen next
episode my personal imagine travel which
is Chad's gotta go to drag I mean how
far away is that it's like it's halfway
across the entire continent right so
he's got to get all the way down there
but he'll get down there and have a
meeting he will and Arya will end up at
Winterfell in the next episode and so
that but then they've got a mind with
what army I guess they'll get the
Dothraki or somebody there to mind that
so he's got a concise I got it but then
like but then meanwhile like you're on
just captured them like what like how
like it seems like getting enough
dragonglass to fight the walkers sleep
minimum a year away what Ben is looking
for is just like little things you know
have time sometimes they put the date
like March 2017
right the next place October 2018 you
want to see some of like the pages of
the calendar fall over quickly to be
clear you don't have a problem with the
flying fire-breathing dragon Oh with the
White Walkers raising zombies but you're
worried about the physics of the time
involved they're breaking their some of
their own rules if they they gave me a
universe where dragons fly okay right I
got it I got it
so fast the my father boats are really
smartest guy he boats and the planet
could not watch television he didn't
know how it worked
he didn't understand jumping for like
you'd see an establishing shot of a
building and then you know that said
like FBI headquarters and then they'd
cut to two guys talking in an office
four of us know okay they're at FBI
headquarters well where are these guys
like FBI headquarters how do we know
they just showed us FBI headquarters so
we were watching a band of brothers and
and they were training before they went
over like Episode two and it was it said
you know you want Carolina March 1943
right and they're guys walking around in
Nazi uniforms because it's training
right
where are they how are there Nazis
they're like it said North Carolina 1943
yeah I know I read that then this is
where it is I could use that on Game of
Thrones yeah you could use a little yes
sometimes I like to think of my father
watching Game of Thrones oh so I had one
other Jon Snow point to me but can I
make a quick Frank mankiewicz a point to
events that he actually did fight the
Nazis and they weren't in North Carolina
they were not and and because he fought
oh when I said when I asked him so how
was it fighting the Nazis he said really
basically really confusing you need to
know where you were he's like he told me
a story once he's running in the woods
the Nazis are behind him and he's firing
like this for different years yeah those
are just establishing shots um so uh so
re ago we debated you guys last week
thought aria was you know fully I don't
remember what I said but we thought she
knew right he got she knew and ii
thought she was pot committed to go into
Cersei but it turned out she had to here
was the brother she loved was alive and
that I guess she could go home there was
a home for yeah right and so she uh she
took that choice and she and she went
north and and either did or didn't find
his dog her dog and that really
interesting line that we debated live
she said it's not you two knew Mary
which right by the way totally cures
gout
I think the merrier so uh but the so she
says it's not you and the question is
did that mean it's not you like that's a
different dialogue would it mean it's
not only like that's not you you don't
walk away from me or it's not you it's
me or wonder there's another one I'm
different
like uh it's not you I'm different so
you didn't maybe you don't recognize me
I get that yeah that's that's what I
said during the episode yeah yeah no I
thought I would just throw out the
possibility that if some starts can
theoretically warg into direwolves what
if it was someone else in the direwolf
inferring she says it's not you it was
someone else in a time yeah but though
you're thinking that it might be brand
in the dire or someone else no that's
just just saying that's not it it's not
numerix driving what it happens in this
world it's because we see brand that if
it was if it was someone hostile that
had ward or Mordor whatever
another mouthful then why did they go
away why I'm not saying it was brand why
wasn't it more friendly so no she was
saying and and it's not you if if it
really wasn't named area why do wouldn't
it kill him
why kill Sara right so it was I think
the only logical explanation is it's not
you it's me
I'm different but thank you for at least
not killing me god bless and all that
but we all think they're coming back
though well we don't know Ameria did
have they did the nice the nice facial
change we saw the softening the dog was
like I know you before right yeah and
and so yeah we were wrong we thought
that she knew that John was around and
was like no I'm laser focus and and I
would have guessed even if I thought she
knew that John Snow was alive she still
does she still would have gotten to
Cersei and she didn't and so in case you
missed it there's the wolf the wolf
though
the road diverges in the woods she took
the path least traveled no jihad for
some magically notably Valley like know
which way is which and the way she way
was there was that that was where I was
the hot pipe returned there many times
no serious I know but how did you know
which way was normal I didn't say which
way was north no no I just I knew that
that is the spot where you can go to the
north or you can't go to King's letter
said that the party there was a party
that was leaving and they were going
towards okay I was giving you too much
but you knew what that place is called
it shows up a lot more of the books I
might have actually said the wrong name
but that is the place they've been there
maybe or is like a hotel restaurant
combo thing kind of yeah yeah I actually
called yes
okay so that which is by the way last
thing on that I've seen is it's a bit of
a shame because we really could have
used her killing seriously by the way if
they were doing my idea of the siege and
cake keeping the army together Arya
comes along yeah look at that perfect
center and kill Cersei and we're done
with it
well we're not we've just delayed are
you getting working your way to kick
yeah she's no my point is that there
would have been a hundred ways to kill
Cersei if you're doing the siege and it
turns out one of them would have been
art right she's not gonna get them they
don't know that I and she's not gonna
get to Winterfell in like a make up my
room and just hang out there and like
woo you know she's doing
yeah is they run into each other on the
road well we don't know did he say that
he did he did but no but he said I'm
going on the road then taking about he
was very clear about that face lighted
yeah I know it's unlikely yeah it's very
yet he's from he's gonna shut him
there's the moment I was there's always
one moment in every recap that makes me
laugh
based on the geography that I know
that's that's not what he's going to do
yeah oh I know mining I know it takes
more than a month curry get dragged less
that time shoddy dragon last
all right what else we got oh so hot pie
who cares about our kids no Riley butter
around the runner and she had a great
joke about I didn't do that was a lovely
scene that was I thought yeah yeah I
just like little things like this it can
remind you that some people are just
living their lives again that's right
oh and thank you for reminding me
because so I you know I invented VIMS
for Game of Thrones when I realize why
it was like the greatest show of all
time one last time we'll go through
violence intrigue mystery sex and in
this one we hit them all including
eunuchs sex never before seen in any
show and really not still seeing yeah
all right but there's a it's missing an
L because this also has lines great
lines Game of Thrones and and I now
realize the only thing I like more than
intrigue is great lines yeah so levins I
don't know vince'll
films maybe films for films well we're
onto something anyway so that was a
great line she had about the pie yeah oh
you cook pies I've cooked water to it
that was of course with three brothers
that she had cooked in the pie in the
pond and and then there was Daenerys had
a couple of great lines including you've
come on an auspicious day when we're
pardoning people who used to serve other
kings right it's good that was a great
line and then and then Varys had a
wonderful you know saving a couple of
lines for himself and there was one over
two other ones that were fantastic in
that one scene I'm gonna go back home
and rewatch that scene just for the line
so the you were bothered by this Janki
so and I am too so that the grand
maesters like they're so arrogant and
sure of themselves yes and they're
supposed to be the smart scientists you
just think that like there would be some
moments of instead of yeah only two
people ever tried that you know what
happened that guy died of greyscale
maybe
you'd be like you know it's only been
tried twice they both tried greyscale
but it's been some time let's do it
you know needed let's do it yeah just so
here's the thing that bothers me they're
supposed to be the educated the
scientist the professor whatever you
want to call them and they have such a
rigid hierarchy and a and they're not
recognizing the value of samwell tarly
in a way that is deeply frustrating for
people were supposed to be the smartest
people that's my cancer so cuz here's a
guy who's seen white walkers are you
shitting me like oh we're gonna drain
you is like a little fucking intern who
gives a shit about you go clean my pond
I'd like okay look I'm gonna have you
clean pots later dude that's just how it
goes okay but meanwhile tell me about
the fucking White Walkers right and let
me take you seriously
you killed it will you see White Walkers
you've killed a white Walker you've done
you've I mean you've done so many things
this guy's a gold mine I'd write a book
about him and then have them clean the
pots so their constant dismissal of them
is not weird it's weird and it's and
it's stupid which is supposed to be the
opposite of thing but just read well I
would say I mean this is partly it's a
fantasy thing like look Harry Potter how
much did he do he still had to go to
class right like the idea of keeping
people down but but also partially I
think while they are sort of the science
and Westeros Westeros has stayed for
thousands and thousands of years with
almost no scientific progress I think
part of it is that the sciences have
their own place that's true but they
also like they are directly serving
Lords and their households like they we
made a joke in the live thing about them
being a part of the establishment and
they do like they kind of like the way
things are they rely on them for funding
and stuff like that they don't push
boundaries I don't think we're supposed
to be totally behind them they're not
you it doesn't really feel like they're
incentivized to experiment and discover
so much is just like research and confer
and and they're gonna write things down
and write things down and there's much
historians as well yes and they might be
more historians than anything else right
and it's it's so it's that thing like
they see themselves as the repository of
knowledge
and that's at least certainly the way it
comes off rather than discovering
anything new right and so in the last
episode where the archmaester is like
did they want walkers before the wall
still stay it's always the end of the
world my own great points which is that
like and that's why he was talking about
some guy was a great writer but didn't
know anything the other guy knew
something was a terrible writer so
that's really forcing their stories and
Samuel says like how about something a
bit more bit more poetic he's like we're
not poets yeah and so librarians nothing
against librarians but their library
yeah and I think the even better point
you guys remaining is it the I guess
they're supposed to be neutral right and
and so they're certainly not supposed to
pick sides they go make sure for all the
houses own guy who got high up in the
ranks that started experimenting and
started learning it learn a new shit
they kiss their mother that's right oh
we can't have any of that yes yeah they
kick to the wall that's the girl right
that's kind of the queen for Cersei so
it's so neutrality breeds establishment
thinking and and they're invested and
don't rock the boat it's so there is it
analogy between them and our mainstream
media if you write right before the end
of the season Sam will get kicked out a
little bit he hasn't like saving Jorah
is not worth his trip he needs something
else and he found out about the
dragonglass
maybe that's or not do you think so
that's definitely not that's the only
reason he needs to be down there they're
going to he'll either get greyscale no
you can't give a heavy guy greyscale
what else do we need for Sam I mean I
hate to be ruthless that way but like I
think together on story for forward he
served his purpose all right so he could
also cure Jorah and then get greyscale
himself okay I think I could cure
himself wait wait I forgot so let me
make sure that I might if not epiphany
but my recognition of this is correct so
the guy that Jamie Lannister is talking
to that's so important
is samwell's down yeah right he's
supposed to be one of the greatest
military tactician 'he's right I'd
forgotten that too thank god Jamie used
the name Tarly like 30 times in the
generation so John I thought he was
saying Tully I'm like I don't know
that's why that's why he was in the
previously make it so I like that uh but
the point about the maesters in the
being the establishment like was that
guy writing a book right yeah and the
book was like about the battles of
Robert Baratheon I mean December I was
thinking like the establishment press
like that they're gonna write at this
book about the great battles around
Ratheon but the truth is beerus said the
truth about Robert wasn't really
interested in the job it was a great
venture like to eat and one ranked liked
women like war is a good night all right
if that goes in the book if but knowing
the bitch is hello no just great fighter
hear the great saddles won by Robert
here like yeah recording history right
now down here here done they wanna they
want to report what happened they don't
want to make anything happen
yeah so so on back to my last thing on
him is that the reason I brought his dad
is that might be one last thing that
needs to get done
so maybe Samwell has a sword his dad
wants that sword back and his dad's a
player he's a player there's got to be
some probably some resolution to that
make grayscale is kind of like a weak
way for a character that is now this
important to go out so so I think it
probably comes back to his dad somehow I
think there's some chance of Jorah
wields that sword maybe and he's a great
warrior now yes wields what's her
heart's pain the Valyrian steel sword
that Sam's father owned wields it
against whoever against the White
Walkers can kill what and they did um
they had one other great shot it wasn't
a line but a great shine we sort of
called it when he was picking those
scabs off they dissolved into a shot of
someone eating pie yeah
the we get to see in all its lurid glory
those scabs come off but don't know
what's going on with with its a
complaint cuz Game of Thrones has so
many terrible like visuals like terrible
isn't like yeah but that was one of the
worst it is weird they show they don't
show us great over between 16 I think
16.1 million people watch the show live
on HBO last week which is amazing for an
HBO show yeah and somebody told me that
there were 90 million tour torrents Wow
Wow that's crazy
so that's wrong pay for the show pay the
artists but you know seriously pay for
HBO look at what they're giving us come
on so um but we live in this crazy world
where like the sex we you know whatever
she's topless I mean I don't care about
any of that stuff we should beautiful
and I it doesn't but like the sex has to
be timid but we can see violence we saw
guys getting their heads cut off we saw
two women one woman choked to death
another woman
basically eviscerated right yeah is that
a reason that was I think so yeah so
like we don't care who cares but like
but we can't show a guy's a penis that
has been mangled or you know that he was
so it just it's it's weird it's been
weird for 60 years it's still weird that
we that it is there that we got a really
warped sense of judgment do you I mean
that we've decided hey an 8 year old can
sit and watch a guy get his head cut off
but God forbid enos a man and woman who
love each other to death right I mean
you were deeply care about each other
having a tender moment of connection
we're like nah we can't have we get
nothing you know so yeah that's a great
point and I actually think that it's at
the heart of American culture because
America was protonic oh that's how we
started and incredibly violent I mean we
took the continent by complete and
savage violence so it's not that
surprising that however
many years later we would have a media
in a culture that glorifies violence and
and and frowns upon said you and you
know and like and and Trump's aside but
Trump's message when he crowned the when
he Winnie christened the aircraft ground
when he christened the aircraft carrier
this week no Nancy
did you see any of that did you thought
tweet but now he was like you know II
just reference no sits about the
unmistakable of American power and a
message to the world
yeah like you know the glorification and
then he asked the 22,000 soldiers to
call their members of Congress and vote
against health care to call the soldiers
there to vote against health care for 22
million Americans was great
oh did he really do that yeah it's
Joffrey at 70 yeah here's what I would
have done I would have christened it and
then said may we never use this but if
we do we will burn our enemies to the
ground alright what else do we what else
do we have here so I bet there's no way
obviously that works cause Richard is
good I mean he was right in the note to
the Khaleesi he was about to kill
himself he was about to kill himself but
I mean that means their course works
there they need to see each other yeah
that's definitely yeah right now you get
really pissed because she's gonna marry
John Snow oh yeah yeah I mean he's gonna
marry Jon Snow and Jorah will be fuckin
angry okay one line that we we are
seeing I'll mention it is the the bitch
she told it go get a cure the combat
debía so when when to serve me though
not to ease let me know so she's not
gonna marry him or whatever it is wait
they're gonna have greyscale penis enter
yeah you can't show that American TV
okay sorry but it's true when Jon Snow
was talking with his people up in the
north I think that it's it's not just
for this one episode that that big guy
from the veil says you can't trust a
Targaryen John is it's hard Aryan like
they will eventually figure that out and
that might that might be a problem no I
don't think it does either but bran is
getting closer and closer like you just
hit the wall he's like a week away from
Winterfell at this point yeah
there that's taking a long time that's
the brand only things the whole show
should be like that just a long flow or
'jewish a journey from place to place
the road Viggo Mortensen so a couple of
more inappropriate comments about the
Miss Sunday scene
Driving Miss Sunday Eddie right she said
the last three Fast and Furious movies
Oh is she okay six seven eight
the two best asses in a sex scene in a
long time
so I'm not being sexist both of them
wonderful nicely done so we were all
wondering of course is it just the
testes that he's lost or also that every
16 putts a 16 million people we're
asking that question and they don't they
don't tell you yeah check the the Google
tracker for the eunuch how often that's
been used and today it spiked
oh yeah there's no watching it I said I
want to see the outtake where she says
oh my god how long was it before they
cut it if I look I think they cut off
everything I mean that's what they did
to Varys that's why they did the great
add to Theon Greyjoy or that's what the
Ramsay Bolton did but they didn't
necessarily Linux my understanding is
normally you just cut off the testicles
because you still need the penis to peel
I understand American history I'm just
going by the van they had uniques of the
hair oh they did yeah I've never been
doing they don't exist anymore anyway so
but it was a nice touch I guess that did
so you're wondering what are they gonna
do and then he goes downstairs it makes
a lot of sense yeah so I'm curious
whether there'll be any you know there
are a lot of black characters on Game of
Thrones right yeah like it's a little
yeah I don't know if it's unfortunate is
the right word that they had the two
black characters who fall in love with
each other it's kind of unknown
you see what I'm saying and they're the
and like that I just you know and then
then she was naked on and she's that's
the the sexist them like I'm curious to
point I looked it up according to
Wikipedia yeah eunuch typically has been
castrated yeah it still has a penis no
tip in typical use if you've been
castrated can you still sex still and in
the cards even adults believe don't
think I know not I don't know definitely
not that was why the eunuchs guarded the
harems right cuz they wouldn't be
interested they that's right but he
right well we don't know if he's
interested in sexy well yeah he just
wants intimacy yeah well and remember
back when they were in marine some of
the unsullied would get the women and
just like lie in bed with them or
something like that
we saw one get assassinated yeah that's
right that's right yeah
alright what else we got any way you
could be anybody explain before the next
episode
oh and Melisandre so she's uh and I like
that because it was an anti game it was
an anti Three's Company conversation
like she said exactly what was happening
she didn't mislead she didn't there was
no obfuscation or confusion she was like
no yeah Stannis that was wrong Jon Snow
he's the right one you know Jon Tyrion
and you know and they were they had that
they had that great Outsiders outcasts
conversation which he recalled to her he
told the truth about Jon Snow
Melisandre told the truth about Jon Snow
and she was like I really think you guys
should get together yeah you know I mean
we're told the truth about the she said
the prince that was promised and Miss
Andy says that's right
yeah no that's a that's not exactly what
that means which is a big one because
that's a prophecy that's had a lot of
pull yeah and it's led to a lot of
theorizing on the web about oh who's the
prince that was promised and maybe it is
maybe it is a princess yes so there's a
couple things that I liked in there
first of all overall for this whole
episode thanks God finally they're
clarifying rings finally people find out
for the about the dragons
for the first time and then they take
them seriously they like wait a minute I
love it
right sir Davos like dragons yeah fuck
get those over here we need those right
yes yeah novice like I got dragons yeah
I guess they got fire right no Birds
White Walkers right let's go yeah get it
so finally the conversation we've been
looking forward to for like two seasons
where they're like proper respect to the
Dragons because otherwise is I'm not
like like they don't need to kiss the
ring or anything like I'm just looking
for like get real dragons our nuclear
weapons you can't ignore them so when
they find out about a milik oh they got
john if he gets to Daenerys John has to
get to Daenerys she's not getting killed
on the road it'll be in the Nam and so
when John gets the Darris you imagine
and an tyrion and varys
and tells them about the walkers that
they'll be like oh alright this is more
important this is not necessary more
important but what well tyrion and varys
will take him seriously I don't know
whether she will or not have a less
serious that she will but we know we
know Cersei won't yes we know sure she
won't care and that will ultimately that
may be here on doing more than oh that
might be her advantage yeah because
while they are doing the right thing to
go fight the white walkers she's like oh
great from the backstab all of you it
would but then if that's the case it
would be a very temporary advantage
although you know I know but that's all
she ever does hold up you know what
makes everybody insane what if Daenerys
doesn't take it seriously and Cersei
does well yeah very surprising Stannis
was the one who's like yeah okay we need
to go up north that's because Stannis in
all of his like being a terrible
terrible person who burned his daughter
alive had honor and so his view of Honor
is we go do the right thing we go fight
the White Walkers because there are
dangers to the whole kings right stupid
conversations because we didn't actually
see Stannis die about whether Stannis
will he's that yeah he's dead or is he
or maybe week he's a White Walkers of
white well they chopped his head off so
by zombie we don't know that choppers
out I've known actually we never saw it
I know my my position on that all along
was he's dead let's know
yeah listen George Romero has left us
the rules about zombies are completely
out the weather an ashtray so to your
point about the Melisandre I like this
she was super straightforward it
actually clarified a bunch of things in
that conversation to finally there
everybody's like hey remember Jon Snow's
live dragons were alive and then now
it's like in order to convince Daenerys
you just go to I used to be poor
that was just labor I was bored okay I
was that's yeah I was life yeah so she
it's actually not very Sanders its
Daenerys Sanders poor I'm but I want to
fix income inequality come on alright
good stuff right yeah so people who are
getting annoyed at me particularly for
politicizing Game of Thrones in the
first episode I made too many Trump I
reserve sorry I'm gonna make more Bernie
Sanders and Trump will all add to that
alright so next week Rubio who's here
I'm here I will not be here I I'm a
politican politico.com slash tyt right
well shall hear a lotta yeah and by the
way you can watch me a bench pure debate
and then watch Game of Thrones review

be better minutes I will be debating
