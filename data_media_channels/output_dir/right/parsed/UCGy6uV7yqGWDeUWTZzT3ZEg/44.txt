as from Levante here for the Revlon
media I'm standing on the stage outside
the Old Bailey behind me over a thousand
throw Sami activists but an activist in
the UK today simply means someone
standing up for the rule of law freedom
of speech and the separation of mosque
and state those things have become
embodied in Tommy Robinson and his case
these people here care deeply I've met
people who have come from across the
United Kingdom and also from abroad for
our reports today go to Tommy Trial calm
I'm here in London covering Tommy
Robinson's contempt of court hearing for
all our videos and to chip into our
crowdfunding campaign to pay for our
independent journalism please go to
Tommy trial calm
you
