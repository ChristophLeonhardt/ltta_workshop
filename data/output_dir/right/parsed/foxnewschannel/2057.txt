>> I'M WONDERING IF SENATOR
HALL WOULD FEEL THE SAME IF
STUDENTS WALKED IN AND
INSTEAD OF THE WORD GOD THE
WORD ALLAH WELCOMED STUDENTS
TO THEIR SCHOOL?
>> GOD WHO SPOKE AGAINST
MONEY AND THE MONEY I CARRY
IN MY WALLET HAS TO SAY IN
GOD WE TRUST.
I THINK THAT'S OFFENSIVE.
BRIAN: EXACTLY.
HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN SAYING
THAT?
MAKES TOTAL SENSE.
AINSLEY: DAN BONGINO THE
FORMER NYPD OFFICER AND
SECRET SERVICE AGENT HOSTED
THE DAN BONGINO SHOW.
YOU HAD SENATOR DAN HALL AND
THE ONE YOU SAW THERE SAID
IT WAS OFFENSIVE SENATOR
JOHN MARTY IN THE STATE OF
MINNESOTA.
THEY ARE MAD BECAUSE IN GOD
WE TRUST IS NOW GOING TO BE
WELL, THERE IS A REPUBLICAN
SENATOR WHO WANTS -- WHO
SPONSORED LEGISLATION TO PUT
IN GOD WE TRUST BACK IN THE
SCHOOLS.
THESE TWO DEMOCRATS.
STEVE: ULTIMATELY.
AINSLEY: WE ARE OFFENDED BY
IT WE DON'T EACH WANT IT IN
OUR MONEY.
>> I THINK IN THE STUPID
OLYMPICS OF COMMENTS, THESE
GUYS GET THE GOLD.
THEY CAN SHARE IT, ACTUALLY.
WE'LL HAVE TWO OF THEM ON
THE MEDAL STANDS UP THERE
GETTING THE GOLD MEDALS IN
THESE DOPEY OLYMPICS.
I DON'T GET IT.
I MEAN THAT USUALLY I HAVE A
GOOD GRASP ON THE STUPIDITY
OF THE RADICAL LEFT.
LET ME BE CLEAR.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ALL
DEMOCRATS.
MY CHURCH IS FULL OF
DEMOCRATS WHO LOVE THEIR GOD
AND LOVE THEIR COUNTRY.
THE RADICAL FAR LEFT CLEARLY
DOES NOT WANT COMPETITION
WITH THE GOVERNMENT.
SO, THEY ARE IN THIS NEVER
ENDING BATTLE AGAINST
RELIGION AND GOD.
AND I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEY THINK THEY ARE
GETTING.
DO THEY THINK PEOPLE OUT
THERE, CHURCH-GOERS, PEOPLE
WHO LOVE THEIR GOD AND
RELIGION ARE GOING TO TAKE
THIS LYING DOWN?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
OF COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO
FIGHT BACK AT THE ELECTION
BOOTH AND IDEOLOGICALLY.
THIS IS ABSURD STRATEGY.
STEVE: DAN, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE
COMPETITION FROM THE CHURCH?
>> HERE'S -- IF YOU ARE A
FAR LEFT RADICAL, YOU NEED
PEOPLE TO BE SURGICALLY
ATTACHED TO THE GOVERNMENT
FOR THEIR MONEY, FOR THEIR
HEALTHCARE, FOR THEIR KID'S
EDUCATION.
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE SAID TO ME
ONCE, THERE IS NO POWER IN
YES FOR THE GOVERNMENT.
MEANING THE GOVERNMENT HAS
TO BE ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE
NO -- AND THAT WAY CAN YOU
COME TO THEM FOR PERMISSION.
THEY DON'T WANT COMPETITION.
THE RIGHT GRANTED BY GOD TO
DEFEND YOURSELF AND LIFE AND
LIBERTY AND HAPPINESS.
THEY DON'T WANT THAT.
THEY HAVE TO DETACH FROM YOU
GOD AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY,
HENCE THIS NEVER ENDING
BATTLE AGAINST RELIGION.
THIS IS GOING TO BLOW UP ON
THEM IF IT HASN'T ALREADY
BIG TIME THOUGH.
AINSLEY: JUST TO CLARIFY,
SENATOR JOHN MARTY AND
SENATOR DAN HALL THE
REPUBLICAN WHO WANTS THIS IN
OUR SCHOOLS.
BRIAN: LET'S MOVE ON TO
ANOTHER THING.
SAME GUY, OKAY, SAME ISSUE.
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GAME
ITSELF.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENS BEFORE THE GAME.
TALK ABOUT THE NFL AND THE
KNEELING POLICY.
IT HURT BUSINESS AND RATINGS
AND CAUSED A NATIONAL
DIALOGUE AND THE PRESIDENT
HAS BEEN RIGHT BEHIND IT HE
HAS BEEN OFFENDED BY IT LIKE
A LOT OF US.
THE NFL HAS DECIDED TO LEAVE
IT UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL 30
PLUS TEAMS IN THE LEAGUE TO
DECIDE IT ON THEIR OWN
NATIONAL ANTHEM POLICY.
I DON'T MIND THIS.
I FEEL AS THOUGH THESE FREE
AGENTS, IF YOU GO TO THE
PATRIOTS YOU ARE
STANDARDING.
GOT TO SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS.
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT
TEAM YOU WANT TO BE DRAFTED
ON, YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO
THAT TEAM, GO TO ANOTHER
TEAM.
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH,
THIS DO YOU?
>> I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH IT AT ALL.
IF I WAS AN NFL OWNER.
YOU TALK ABOUT REALLY SILLY
BUSINESS DECISIONS.
IF THERE WERE A BOOK LIKE
HOW TO DESTROY YOUR BUSINESS
IN 12 SIMPLE STEPS, STEP
NUMBER ONE WOULD BE YOU
KNOW, WATCH WHAT THE NFL
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO KNEEL ON
THE FIELD.
I WOULD FIRE EVERY ONE OF
THESE GUYS?
IS THERE GOING TO BE BLOW
BACK FROM THE RADICAL FAR
LEFT?
OF COURSE, THERE IS BLOW
BACK FOR EVERYTHING.
THERE IS A COUPLE KIDS IN
MOMMY'S BAMPLET WITH THEIR
TWITTER MAKING THEM SEEM
LIKE THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THEY ARE.
THE REAL AMERICANS OUT THERE
THAT WATCH THE NFL, THAT
LOVE THE SPORT, I MEAN GUYS
LIKE ME THAT DON'T WATCH IT
ANYMORE WERE DEEPLY OFFENDED
BY.
THIS IF THEY FIRED EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THESE GUYS
THEY MIGHT GET THEIR
AUDIENCE BACK.
I LIKE THE DECISION.
I WILL TELL YOU, I WAS AT
THE NRA CONVENTION IN
DALLAS, YOU WOULD BE
SURPRISED, BRIAN, MAYBE YOU
WOULDN'T.
I SPOKE TO THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE THIS WEEKEND, AND THE
NFL IS STILL A BIG ISSUE
WITH THEM.
AND I DON'T MEAN IT IN A
GOOD WAY.
THEY WERE REALLY UPSET.
STEVE: IT'S NOT A DECISION.
THEY ARE PUNTING ON IT WE
DON'T WANT TO DECIDE.
EVERYBODY ELSE FIGURE IT
OUT.
BRIAN: DO YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THE UNION IS
STANDING IN HEIR WAY AND THE
NFL CAN'T EVEN PRETEND AS IF
THEY ARE MAKING THE FINAL
DECISION ON PARK AVENUE.
STEVE: NEGOTIATE.
BRIAN: THE NBA DID.
BUT THE NFL JUST CAN'T WORK
THIS OUT.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
