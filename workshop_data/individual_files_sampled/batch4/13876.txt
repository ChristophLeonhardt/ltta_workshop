I remember back in 2008 when the Democrats actually had small children singing hymns to President Obama then candidate Obama now Democrats have gone even beyond that here is a bunch of baito Aurora supporters I don't know why doing YMCA but be ETO in unison it's not good now what I love about this most is the move that was made by Democrats that beta O'Rourke draws an incredibly diverse crowd if you can't see this this is all old white people and a small girl that's really what it is it's like all a bunch of all the white people who can barely move it looks like workout night at the local old-age home I mean it looks like it does when you actually go down to the YMCA and you see the people who are 60 in the water doing physical therapy except they're doing B eto for Senate so that was strong but that was not the strongest entry in the beta worship him kn'l hey the strongest entry comes courtesy of some crazy ladies who decided to cut the weirdest video I've seen in the selection cycle well I can't say that I mean I've seen so many weird videos in this election cycle I can't but this one is pretty astonishing here we go I don't even know what this is but listen if you can bear to not a parody of a dose of words these are actual beta supporters I know I know people are telling me to cut this but I can't bez Verizon it's Verizon way bad this is not actually a parity of beta supporters from what I understand so good stuff there from the beta supporters really demonstrating that they don't care too much about a guy driving over a median line being super drunk and crashing into a trunk and then fleeing and also I mean I can see why they don't care that much about drunkenness considering you would have to be drunk to think that was a good idea
