- Jonathan let me start with a question that I'm gonna draw upon all my years of legal training and my all my years of legal practice and ask you a sort of an in-depth question regarding jurisprudence what the hell is going on on the matter for trial I mean you you you have you have the jurors are not sequestered and one of the most important trials where witness tampering it would seem would be an utmost concern to any judge Russians running around you have of course the judge making just crazed attacks at the prosecution on and off and apologizes and then continues poking them accuses one prosecutor who stared down mob families and that his life threatened by mobs mobsters of crying in court just this is a bizarre trial and I must say there is so much evidence just in the documents against Paul Manafort and the jury's still out well I was going on here well the most curious thing is actually the defense it makes no sense if you think he's trying to win I don't think he is I don't think this is an acquittal strategy otherwise he would have put on defense witnesses he would have created a narrative that would knock down or explain all these really damaging documentary pieces of evidence he didn't I think this really looks like a hung jury strategy that the best that they can hope for is a see if they can get out of this with a tie the problems that you can easily hang in a hung jury strategy you the jury can can come out without a verdict on some counts but still reach a verdict on others I think in addition to a hung jury strategy it's clearly a pardoned strategy and the best things going for man afford in this trial actually came not from the witness stand but as you note as you mentioned from the bench itself the judge made very damaging comments in front of the jury that helps I also think frankly that man afford is helped by two other people Omarosa and Michael Cohen I think that what his team hopes is that the Trump is going to look at people like Michael Cohen and seriously think of a pardon for Manta for not just a reward as loyalty but the show Michael Cohen you picked the wrong horse you know when you decided to switch over to molar so all of those things I think are encouraging man afford but the one thing I don't see him trying to do or at least work hard at is to get an acquittal now Andrea Mitchell is with us and has a question Andrea well I'm wondering about an issue that that Joe just touched on which is the lack of sequesteration of this jury once it went to once it went to the jury not only the fact that they were walking around in the elevators and according to our reporters were brushing up against reporters and other people in the courthouse throughout the trial but you like the President of the United States coming out on the South Lawn on Friday and speaking about how Paul Manafort is a good man and had already gone to the jury so what in your experience would tell you that these jurors did not hear or see at home this weekend as diligent as they might be some reference to the president's support for Paul Manafort to say nothing of what might still take place why aren't they sequester that's an excellent question and reaiiy think that the most judges view sequestering as called for particularly when there's threats against jurors there is one juror that apparently did feel threatened that alone would have led many judges just to sequester the jury you usually don't have sequestering just because they might violate the order of the court which tells them to stay away from the media not read or discuss the case I think in this district sequestering is not as prevalent as some other districts but this is a judge that clearly felt it wasn't necessary this is a saturated news story and I think the chances that these jurors are going to be in some type of vacuum space is unlikely how much that's going to impact the jury's decision is hard to say this jury is clearly taking it very seriously you know the questions they asked the judge showed that they're drilling down on the right questions look yet what really constitutes reasonable doubt and other things of that time thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
