1
00:00:12,857 --> 00:00:14,591
>> Sean: MORE REACTION TO

2
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,159
TONIGHT'S MONOLOGUE, AND

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,527
AMERICA'S FIRST ACTION SENIOR

4
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:19,262
ADVISOR, SEAN SPICER, AND THE

5
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:20,430
AUTHOR OF A BRAND-NEW

6
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:24,167
BEST SELLER, SPYGATE, FORMER

7
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:25,001
SECRET SERVICE AGENT.

8
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:26,970
SEAN, I KNOW YOU WENT THROUGH A

9
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:28,772
LOT WHEN THE PRESS SECRETARY,

10
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:32,375
AND WORDS ARE ONE THING, BUT

11
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,244
WHEN YOU HAVE LEADERS -- THE

12
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:34,844
FORMER CANDIDATE FOR THE

13
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:36,813
DEMOCRATIC PARTY SAYING, WE

14
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:39,215
CAN'T BE CIVIL WITH THEM.

15
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:40,150
WE HAVE THE FORMER

16
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:41,951
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE USA

17
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:42,752
SAYING, KICK THEM?

18
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:45,989
IF THEY GO LOW, WE KICK THEM?

19
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,590
THEN WE HAVE MAXINE WATERS

20
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:48,958
SAYING, YOU SEE THESE CABINET

21
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:50,126
PEOPLE AND YOU GET A CROWD AND

22
00:00:50,127 --> 00:00:53,730
YOU FOLLOW THEM INTO GAS

23
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:54,397
STATIONS AND GROCERY STORES.

24
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:58,768
YOU SAW THAT FROM PAM BONDI,

25
00:00:58,769 --> 00:00:59,769
SECRETARY NIELSEN AND TED CRUZ,

26
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,337
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET KILLED

27
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:01,638
HERE.

28
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:06,142
BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO CARE.

29
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:13,183
>> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

30
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:16,686
AND HE SHOT UP BY A OF HOUSE

31
00:01:16,687 --> 00:01:20,957
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS.

32
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,425
I THINK THE CONCERN, IT ALL

33
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:24,761
SEEMS TO BE WORKING IN ONE

34
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:25,562
DIRECTION.

35
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:26,496
INSTEAD OF DENOUNCING IT, YOU

36
00:01:26,497 --> 00:01:28,164
KNOW THE MEDIA WOULD BE OUT

37
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:30,366
THERE ASKING THE RIGHT TO DO

38
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:33,036
THAT, AND THEN YOU SEE IT

39
00:01:33,037 --> 00:01:36,573
DOUBLING DOWN.

40
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:38,208
THESE PEOPLE ARE DOUBLING DOWN

41
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:40,176
AND INCITING IT, AND IF THIS WAS

42
00:01:40,177 --> 00:01:42,779
THE RIGHT DOING IT TO THE LEFT,

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,380
IF THESE WERE DONALD TRUMP

44
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:45,114
SUPPORTERS, THEY WOULD BE

45
00:01:45,115 --> 00:01:46,883
OUTRAGED ON EVERY ONE OF THOSE

46
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:48,451
LEFT-WING CABLE SHOWS THAT WE

47
00:01:48,452 --> 00:01:52,455
SEE TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

48
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:56,593
IT'S OUTRAGED -- >> Sean: GO

49
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:57,360
AHEAD AND FINISH.

50
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:59,529
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, I'VE

51
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,930
NEVER SEEN SUCH A DOUBLE

52
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:01,364
STANDARD.

53
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:02,999
THEY JUSTIFY THE ACTIONS ON THE

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,934
LEFT, HE IS ALL THE COMMENTATORS

55
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:08,171
HOSTS ON CNN SAYING PLEASE DON'T

56
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:11,307
CALL IT A MOB, WHICH IT CLEARLY

57
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:12,375
IS.

58
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:14,844
>> Sean: HOW DARE WE SAY IT'S

59
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:15,144
A MOB.

60
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:19,315
>> YES.

61
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:20,116
>> Sean: "THE NEW YORK POST"

62
00:02:20,117 --> 00:02:20,884
ACTUALLY SAID, THESE ARE THE

63
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:23,386
PEOPLE THAT ARE WANTED.

64
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:25,555
NOT ONLY PORTLAND LAST WEEKEND

65
00:02:25,556 --> 00:02:27,690
AND THIS WEEKEND BUT NEW YORK

66
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,526
THIS WEEKEND AND A BUNCH OF

67
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:30,793
ANARCHISTS WHICH GO TO THE

68
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:33,930
NEW YORK G.O.P. CLUB, REPUBLICAN

69
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:34,831
CLUB OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO

70
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:36,633
BE.

71
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,368
THEY ARE MEETING VANDALISM AND

72
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:40,003
ANARCHISTS, SIGNS THAT THEY ARE

73
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:41,471
PUTTING UP ET CETERA AND THEN

74
00:02:41,472 --> 00:02:48,945
THERE'S A CONFRONTATION ON THE

75
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:49,379
STREET THERE.

76
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,248
I'M KIND OF PIT STOP THAT I EVEN

77
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:54,284
BELIEVE FOR A SECOND WHAT THEY

78
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:54,584
WROTE.

79
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:55,752
THIS IS COMING FROM THE RADICAL

80
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:59,122
LEFT, BUT LOOK AT ALEC BALDWIN,

81
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:00,990
THE LOWEST RATINGS IN THE

82
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:03,626
HISTORY BASICALLY OF ANY NETWORK

83
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:04,027
TELEVISION.

84
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:08,031
IT'S NEVER BEEN THAT LOW.

85
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:09,165
OR MICHAEL MOORE'S MOVIE.

86
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:09,832
DOES THIS TRANSLATE TO THE

87
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,769
BALLOT BOX IN 22 DAYS?

88
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,137
>> WE ARE ALREADY SEEING SOME OF

89
00:03:14,138 --> 00:03:17,373
THE RESULTS OF THAT.

90
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:20,176
WE ARE SEEING A RAISE CLOSING IN

91
00:03:20,177 --> 00:03:21,544
MICHIGAN.

92
00:03:21,545 --> 00:03:23,379
JOHN JAMES, AN INSURGENT

93
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,947
CANDIDATE.

94
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:26,215
>> Sean: I THINK HE'S A

95
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:26,783
ROCK STAR.

96
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:27,450
I LOVE HIM.

97
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:30,587
>> IS GREAT, IS VIDEOS ARE

98
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:31,387
TERRIFIC.

99
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:32,021
TWO QUICK POINTS.

100
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:34,490
THE LEFT'S RELIGION AND STATE

101
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:35,925
POWER, THAT'S THEIR RELIGION.

102
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:39,028
WHEN THEY LOSE STATE POWER, THEY

103
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:41,364
HAVE NOTHING TO FALL BACK ON.

104
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:43,466
THEY ARE SOCIALISTS AND THEIR

105
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:44,601
RELIGION, THEY GENUFLECT AT THE

106
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:51,040
ALTAR STATE POWER.

107
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:55,211
>> YOU KNOW HOW THEY LIED AND

108
00:03:55,212 --> 00:03:56,379
THEY DISSEMINATED FALSE

109
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:56,779
INFORMATION.

110
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,348
ALL THE PHONY DOCUMENTS LEAKED

111
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:00,283
BEFORE THE ELECTION, AND THEN IT

112
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:04,420
WAS USED TO SET UP THE WHOLE

113
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,755
MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

114
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:07,423
MAXINE WATERS SAYS TO ME, DON'T

115
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:08,191
SAY IT.

116
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:10,193
WE WILL DO IT BUT DON'T SAY IT.

117
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:12,395
NOW THE CENTER FOR

118
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:12,895
AMERICAN PROGRESS,

119
00:04:12,896 --> 00:04:13,863
JOHN PODESTA'S GROUP, THEY ARE

120
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:15,632
NOW OUT THERE SAYING DON'T TALK

121
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:16,799
ABOUT IMMIGRATION.

122
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,967
DON'T TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU

123
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:19,002
REALLY WANT TO DO.

124
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:20,403
SO FOR THEM TO WIN THEY HAVE TO

125
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:21,771
LIE AND HIDE WHO THEY REALLY ARE

126
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:25,074
WHICH IS A PRETTY REVEALING

127
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:25,441
INSTANCE.

128
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:27,510
AND THEN WE HAVE THE TAPE OF

129
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:28,444
PHIL BRED A SIN.

130
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:31,481
>> IF YOU LOOK AT A CANDIDATE,

131
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:32,715
IT'S CALLED THE PEOPLE OF

132
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:37,186
ARIZONA CRAZY.

133
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:39,155
ALL OF THESE TAPES START

134
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:39,822
UNRAVELING ABOUT HER TALKING

135
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:45,895
ABOUT IT BEING OKAY TO JOIN THE

136
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:50,733
TALIBAN.

137
00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:51,968
>> Sean: LET'S GO BACK.

138
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:53,403
>> THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD

139
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:54,470
WITH HOW THEY COVER THE RIGHT

140
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:57,173
AND HOW THEY COVER THE LEFT.

141
00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:59,776
ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS TALK

142
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:01,377
ABOUT THE STYLE AND SUBSTANCE

143
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:02,211
WITH DONALD TRUMP.

144
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:03,579
THEY CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE

145
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,213
CANDIDATES OR THE RESULTS

146
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:06,516
BECAUSE IF THERE IS EITHER

147
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:07,884
ECONOMIC POLICY OR FOREIGN

148
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:08,217
POLICY.

149
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:09,218
THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING THINGS

150
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:10,486
DONE AND THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T BE

151
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:12,822
WHAT HE'S GETTING DONE.

152
00:05:12,823 --> 00:05:14,490
>> Sean: I SEE THINGS MOVING

153
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:16,059
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH THE

154
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,562
SENATE, SEAN SPICER, BUT IN THE

155
00:05:19,563 --> 00:05:22,598
HOUSE IT'S TOO HARD TO TELL.

156
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:31,040
>> IT'S GETTING CLOSE.

157
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,976
>> IT'S CLOSER, BUT ARE YOU

158
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:41,150
CONFIDENT THAT THE HOUSE?

159
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:42,952
>> A WHOLE LOT OF THEM WILL

160
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:48,424
BE -- THEY STOP THE AGENDA DEAD

161
00:05:48,425 --> 00:00:00,000
IN THEIR TRACKS.
