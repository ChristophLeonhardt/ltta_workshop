1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,580
President Obama recently used executive orders
to make major changes to the United States

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,059
immigration policy, an act that did not sit
well with the right.

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,440
Some Republicans are proposing

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,970
to fight back against the President’s immigration
overhaul with threats of another government

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,970
shutdown.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,070
But, what exactly does it mean to shutdown
the government and is it an effective

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,160
political tool?

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,460
Well, a government shutdown happens when Congress
does not pass funding legislation

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,580
put forth by the Executive Branch.

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,680
Basically, if Congress doesn’t pass an agreed
upon annual

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,810
budget, federal programs begin to shut down.

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,430
This usually happens because the two sides

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,570
cannot agree on a major issue.

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,750
In 2013 the Republicans in the House passed
budgetary

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,530
amendments that would harm Obamacare and the
Democratic controlled Senate rejected the

16
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,530
budget.

17
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,540
There was more back and forth between the
two sides, but this difference ultimately

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,940
resulted in a government shutdown.

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,010
However, even if the Obamacare changes passed
through

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,280
the Senate, the President would have used
his veto power, which would have also resulted

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
in a

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,370
government shutdown.

23
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,690
Every year in order to avoid a shutdown, the
House, the Senate and the

24
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,850
President all need to come to an agreement
on the budget.

25
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,240
So what happens when the government shuts
down?

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,190
Welp, the President and Congress still get
paid, but many other people do not.

27
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,190
Federal

28
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,970
employees are split into two categories, essential
and non-essential personnel, with the latter

29
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,080
being forced to go home unpaid.

30
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,760
Anyone that works in national security, including
embassies

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,770
abroad, federal prisons, border patrols, emergency
and disaster workers and those who operate

32
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,280
the power grid are considered essential personnel.

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,410
Almost everyone else is considered non-
essential.

34
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,260
This used to include Military personnel, but
in 2013 Congress passed a bill

35
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,229
ensuring them a paycheck.

36
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,600
In 2013 federal programs like the National
Institute of Health, Department of Housing

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,440
and the Department of Homeland Security all
took major blows.

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,660
Over 400 National Parks

39
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,920
and Monuments closed down, as did the Environmental
Protection Agency and parts of the

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,200
Department of Veterans Affairs.

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,180
The government estimates that about 800,000
government

42
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,190
workers went unpaid during the shutdown.

43
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,949
So, is shutting down the government an effective
political tool?

44
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,148
The answer is.

45
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:11,149
Sometimes.

46
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:15,180
During a shutdown, the public starts to turn
on political parties and both sides feel pressure

47
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,280
to get things done.

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,420
In 1978 there was a shutdown that lasted 18
days, mostly over President

49
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,610
Carter vetoing money for an aircraft carrier
he thought was wasteful spending.

50
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,610
In the end,

51
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,310
congress relented and the budget went through
without that line item.

52
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,319
A similar outcome

53
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,450
occurred in a 1982 shutdown which defunded
a missile program that President Reagan wanted.

54
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,590
But usually shutdowns are resolved by passing
temporary budgets that give the disagreeing

55
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,930
sides more time to compromise.

56
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,790
There have been 18 shutdowns since 1976 and
they each

57
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,050
happen for their own reasons.

58
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,390
One time the government shut down for an entire
day, because

59
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,420
Congress just didn't get around to voting
on a budget in time.

60
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,540
Our elected officials aren't the only ones
who have to make big decisions...

61
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,540
Ever wonder if

62
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,569
college is actually worth the investment?

63
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,950
Our friends over at Life Noggin just made
a fantastic

64
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,390
video about it.
