the 32 remaining teams will learn who they'll face in the group stage of next summer's tournament that's a big draw it's a big deal and we've decided it's more than a one-man job so arty has brought in somebody to help me out can you guess who it is if I tell you that this is a player who played 129 times internationally and he scored one goal what would you say yep I can't repeat that on air what if I then told you he's a goalkeeper that's more impressive isn't it and what if I said that he won a Champions League and a european championship now i've got your interest i am very pleased to announce that are joining me throughout the World Cup coverage on RT is going to beat the Great Dane himself Peter Schmeichel is such a pleasure to have you with us and I'm not too embarrassed to say that I in my opinion you are the best goalkeeper I ever saw play the game you're making you blush eight in the cold of Moscow and blush it is Italy so thank you very much and it is so great to have you in I want to talk about that goal cuz you must afford your friends and fans to tears with that you scored a goal as a keeper amazing I can for you a row with that quite frankly it was a penalty in the frame friendly match against Belgium it's still had to be scored and the goal is at all great time you where there's lots to look forward to first of all though because we've got more than just a goalkeeper on board it's got a striker as well the Stan Collymore took a sneak peek behind the scenes ahead of the draw which is going to take place at the state crown palace just behind us welcome to the media center here at the Kremlin ahead of the FIFA World Cup draw on Friday as you can see people having their photos taken with the famous trophy which will be given out at the Luzhniki stadium in July next year to the winners of this most famous tournament and almost touches this is the official fifa world cup ball of managed to get my hands on one there's a painful guy over there that wants to take it off me there's the logo there's the sponsor adidas it's the 13th time since 1970 the adidas have sponsored the World Cup ball without the tango Espania in 1982 we've heard the Jabulani in South Africa in 2010 but this has gone back to the beginning 1970 was the first one that added I started to sponsor the World Cup balls and they've gone back to the future with this design this is gonna be what's kicking off the World Cup in the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow right the way through to the end in the middle of July I for one cannot wait right let's take you on a whirlwind trip around the 11 cities started with Volgograd hello Walden Brad by 5 let's go to Ekaterinburg hello Ekaterinburg let's go to kazan we were here for the Confederations crop i-5 Kazan let's go to the drawer we're just about to going through the draw ball where the FIFA World Cup draw on Friday is going to be one of the first to get as you can hear over my shoulder the draw behind-the-scenes has already started I'm going to keep it nice and simple for you there are 32 nations divided into four pots of a team's pot one other house Russia and include the top seven ranked teams on the planet so Russia join five times winners Brazil the world champions Germany Cristiano Ronaldo on Portugal the European champions Leo Messi and Argentina Belgium the Dark Horse's to win it France the 1998 champions and finally Poland consider liked by government from around the world they're very excited as we are we're going to have some special guests on Rt through the day so keep it arty on espanol Arabic and English and who will finally Brazil Argentina England and the host Russia get to play at the FIFA World Cup next year we'll find out on our two and Peter of course first time Russia's hosted this big event a lot of pressure on the organizers and on the team itself what is that like well I think this is this is probably one of the biggest challenges there that Russia will ever face one thing is a whole organization garlic you know just by being here you kind of sense that everything is under control the other thing is being a player leading the team having to represent your own country in a World Cup that that that you host that's a completely different you know kettle of fish extra pressure it's extra pressure and I met a couple of guys who's actually been in that situation both of them played in the World Cup winning team in France back in 1998 where France were the hosts and they know exactly what is going to be like to be a player for Russia who do you see as the favourites to win it Brazil Brazil definitely with Germany Germany because they've showed great ability great skill with the second team during the Confederation Cup and Brazil because if all together at the same time they managed you know to play well they have individual players who can make the difference and at the same time collectively they are very tough indiscipline brazilian jam and spay and maybe I hope France is there a dark hose in there someone that we don't look at too often that you can say way they can do really good I'm looking after Croatia maybe you never know Sweden have surprised everyone you know on on beating Italy collectively without having any individual players but they made it maybe the dynamic I was waiting and I liked it so much good play yeah we love Kristensen yeah I loved I loved it could it be one of the big stars for me named Dana because he want he want a nivel included inaudible and Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo we want them are we want someone else is the only one potentially that can you know shine you know behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi so we hope Neymar and Bobby who is a French guy for friends for Germany for Brazil for every team in the pot one maybe did not don't take this pain because if you take Spain it was a group very very hard Nigeria the know we have Iran there are teams that you think that oh it might be quite easy to play against them but Nigeria is a good team there is a very good Costa Rica is a very between Egypt is a very team be careful I think obviously the big-name players are the center of the attention we can't do without the fans you know this and there are 11 particularly enthusiastic guests who will be coming to tonight's big event I'm talking about they called them the superfans I think they're lucky fans their 11th footy fans they've been chose from different cities ride across Russia all because of their passion for the beautiful game and it's clear from looking at their ages that you can love football however old you are the youngest super fan is just 6 while the oldest one is 12 times his age siempre VA mrs. Mullin near she sleep mobile in Russian yes or drift of powders minionese Cacnea yeah yeah a balance sheet multiple media the creature creature out here initially is cocktail present a pedometer cool yeah grade remember it am NOT a strategic Nepali yes Yugoslavia - no comment bogus proficiency mommy you just referred my list now the World Cup will offer the chance for a lot of football fans to come and visit Russia for the very first time FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samaras spoke to Stan Collymore about her Russia experience I really was fascinated by the level of commitment of local authorities and more importantly by the warm welcome what pleased you the most from that Russian welcoming in the summer for the Confederations club because I was here and one of my roles I believe is as a black man to speak honestly about whatever country I broadcast in and I've been here six or seven times now another fantastic time people don't look at me differently on the street people don't treat me differently which is against some of the stereotypes that we are presented with well exactly what you just described when I came for the first time in Russia it was in July last year one months after my assignment and definitely like every African person I was just fearing to be treated differently and I was ready also to help people think differently about Africa and Africans but as we speak I've been here for at least 20 times together I haven't suffered any Russia issues so with just over six months to go until the World Cup Russia is getting its stadiums ready for action and many of them though have already been tested out of course at last summer's Confederations come and a lot of fans who traveled here for that tournament they've told us they had such a great time and they will definitely be back in 2018 when we went to the much with Mexico and Russia we thought maybe they were like gonna be mad if we want to match it's completely off of it they were still like really friendly Russian people are so friendly friendly that's the world it's been amazing beautiful it's very beautiful yeah definitely we will we will come back for the World Cup guys you should come yeah definitely be here next year it will invite your Mexican friends to come with I was working at the confederation scope and I couldn't testify to that the fans that really did love it and a lot of them you know it's a long journey and it's expensive but a lot of them are coming back let's get to the draw though that's what we're really here for just a few hours ago now and as I understand you actually taken polity in one of these things sort of experience different levels obviously being a player you're waiting for the draw you know you're excited about who you're gonna get who you're going to play against I've been in two of the euros drawers as well but I've actually picked out the ball and I've hosted chambers leek jaws and they're all exciting in in each and every way the thing about being a player so when you qualify obviously you don't think about who you're gonna play the next time you kind of think about what's gonna happen is when the ceilings what when the pots are actually being announced and you can see who you can actually you kind of sort of finding your way through who do you want who do you not want and then obviously when the draw comes around it becomes probably the most exciting part of the sort of pre World Cup and then it's not really who you really want it's who you want to avoid yeah absolutely so you know the draws really really it's exciting because it's it's such a big part of what's gonna happen in the summer you you wouldn't mind Brazil I I'll wager there's a few managers you probably don't want to face though it's very exciting everyone's got their own opinion it's just a matter of hours now until the draw gets underway who will your team get the ceremony kicks off at 6:00 p.m. Moscow time do stay with us with our tea with Peter and myself for all the buildup
