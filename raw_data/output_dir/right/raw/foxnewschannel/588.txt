1
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:15,124
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS NOW TAKING

2
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:21,564
LEGAL ACTION AGAINST OMAROSA.

3
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:23,233
AS SHE CONTINUES PLUGGING HER

4
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:24,901
NEW BOOK, SHE IS NOW SAYING SHE

5
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:29,472
HAS PLENTY OF TAPES AND OTHERS

6
00:00:29,473 --> 00:00:33,877
HAVE RECORDED USING A RACIAL

7
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:34,377
SLUR.

8
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:36,145
SHE ALSO SAID SHE'S BEEN

9
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:37,647
APPROACHED BY ROBERT MUELLER'S

10
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:39,282
TEAM ABOUT THE TAPES AND SHE

11
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:41,451
WILL COOPERATE.

12
00:00:41,452 --> 00:00:42,585
COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT KELLY

13
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:44,621
ON COSTS WAY IS BLASTING HER FOR

14
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,260
>> IT DOES SEEM UNGRATEFUL TO GO

15
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:51,995
AND RECORD PEOPLE IN A SITUATION

16
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:52,295
ROOM.

17
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:55,198
I SEE A LOT OF DEMOCRATS OUT

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,433
THERE AND A NATIONAL SECURITY

19
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,369
EXPERTS WHO ARE NOT EXACTLY

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,371
PRO-TRUMP WORK BRO

21
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:02,739
KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYING, HOLD

22
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:05,775
SITUATION ROOM?

23
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:07,210
PEOPLE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

24
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:07,510
THAT.

25
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:15,251
TO SAY THERE WERE NO TAPES OF

26
00:01:15,252 --> 00:01:17,854
THE APPRENTICE, I DON'T HAVE

27
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:21,157
THAT WORD IN MY VOCABULARY AND

28
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:21,591
NEVER HAD IT.

29
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:23,826
SHE MADE IT UP.

30
00:01:23,827 --> 00:01:24,494
OMAROSA HAS ZERO CREDIBILITY

31
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:27,997
WITH THE MEDIA BUT NOW THAT SHE

32
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:29,365
SAID THAT ABOUT ME THEY WILL

33
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:32,568
TALK TO HER.

34
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:33,603
ANDY, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

35
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:42,545
>> IT'S TROUBLE TROUBLESOME TO

36
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:45,415
ME THAT THERE ARE NONDISCLOSURE

37
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:55,591
CONTRACTS THAT YOU WANT NOT TO

38
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:57,126
TALK ABOUT THINGS, YOU GET A

39
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:05,835
GRAND JURY SUBPOENA.

40
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:08,338
THOSE ARE SUNSHINE LAWS THAT

41
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:08,938
APPLY TO THE GOVERNMENT

42
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:10,640
INFORMATION ACT AND THE LIKE,

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:19,148
WITH THE IDEA THAT WE WANT THE

44
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:23,820
GOVERNMENT TO BE TRANSPARENT AND

45
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:26,789
OF COURSE THOSE NEED TO BE

46
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,124
PRIVILEGED AND PROTECTED.

47
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,726
THE PRESUMPTION IN GOVERNMENT

48
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:30,760
SHOULD BE TRANSPARENCY.

49
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:32,795
I DON'T THINK THIS TRANSPARENCY

50
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:34,397
SHOULD BE THAT YOU WILL CLAM UP.

51
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:40,937
NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS WITH

52
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:42,271
BRINGING RECORDING DEVICES INTO

53
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:43,272
THE WEST WING.

54
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:46,576
IS THERE A LEGAL LIABILITY FOR

55
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:48,444
HER ON THAT FRONT?

56
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:50,613
>> I THINK OF HER SECURITY

57
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:52,582
CLEARANCE WERE, IF SHE HAD ONE,

58
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,717
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF SHE HAD

59
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:58,187
ONE, IF THAT WEREN'T CONTINUING

60
00:02:58,188 --> 00:02:59,422
TO HER CLEARLY THAT WOULD BE

61
00:02:59,423 --> 00:02:59,989
YANKED.

62
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,657
THIS KIND OF VIOLATION, YOU

63
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:03,192
WOULD LOSE YOUR CLAIMANTS.

64
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:04,160
WHETHER YOU WOULD BE PROSECUTED

65
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:07,130
OR NOT WOULD DEPEND I THINK ON

66
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:08,765
WHETHER THERE WAS ACTUALLY SOME

67
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:12,101
KIND OF A TRANSMISSION OF

68
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:13,169
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION THAT GOT

69
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,770
OUT THERE.

70
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:15,538
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME TO HAVE

71
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,974
HAPPEN TO, BUT THAT WOULD BE THE

72
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:18,307
CONCERN.

73
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:21,411
>> IT SEEMS NORMAL TO HAVE A

74
00:03:21,412 --> 00:03:21,844
NONDISCLOSURE.

75
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:22,678
COMING FROM ENTERTAINMENT THAT

76
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,780
SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE DO

77
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:25,348
ESPECIALLY IF SHE'S DOING A SHOW

78
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,183
AND SHE WAS ON THE SHOW, THAT

79
00:03:27,184 --> 00:03:29,285
SORT OF THING THAT YOU CAN GO

80
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:30,353
WRITE A BOOK AFTERWARDS WHERE

81
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:35,658
BUT AT THE SAME TIME -- AND I

82
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:39,128
THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM, SHE'S

83
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:41,364
OUT THERE DOING THIS THING WHERE

84
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:42,498
SHE APPARENTLY SIGNED A

85
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:48,771
NONDISCLOSURE DOING IT.

86
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:51,941
>> WHAT A TERRIBLE IDEA AND THIS

87
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:56,546
CREDIBILITY.

88
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:58,114
BUT WHY USE THAT KIND OF

89
00:03:58,115 --> 00:03:58,481
LANGUAGE?

90
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:04,587
>> THAT'S MY QUESTION FOR YOU,

91
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:05,521
IS OMAROSA CREDIBLE?

92
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:07,557
>> IT'S BECAUSE IT'S CLICKBAIT.

93
00:04:07,558 --> 00:04:09,559
AND IT'S GOING TO GET PEOPLE TO

94
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,562
TUNE IN AND THEY WILL WATCH IT

95
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:13,396
BECAUSE IT'S FALLACIOUS AND

96
00:04:13,397 --> 00:04:14,664
DIRTY AND PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT

97
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:16,399
TO LIKE TRUMP LOVE TO HEAR THAT

98
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,166
HE USED THAT WORD.

99
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:21,571
THEN THE TAPE GOT LEAKED AND YOU

100
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:36,252
THE SECURITY ISSUES ARE RAIL,

101
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:37,620
AND IT DANA PERINO WROTE A

102
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:38,521
WONDERFUL PIECE ABOUT HOW

103
00:04:38,522 --> 00:04:39,288
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN WHEN

104
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:43,459
SHE WAS IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE.

105
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,727
NO ONE WILL RENUMBER THIS IN

106
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:49,699
PRESIDENCY AND IS TOO IMPORTANT

107
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,667
AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS THAT WILL

108
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:53,202
LIVE ON FOREVER.

109
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:54,871
SHE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT

110
00:04:54,872 --> 00:04:58,508
WHEN SHE WENT IN THERE AND WAS

111
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:00,276
RECORDING PEOPLE.

112
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:07,450
HOLLYWOOD TAPE THEY MADE THEIR

113
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:08,718
DECISION ABOUT THIS PERSON AND I

114
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:11,587
DON'T LIKE A RECORDING OF HIM

115
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:12,788
USING A RACIAL SLUR POST

116
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:13,956
CHARLOTTESVILLE FOR INSTANCE

117
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:16,592
MOVES THE NEEDLE AT ALL COME

118
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:17,193
ELECTION DAY.

119
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:23,833
IF THERE IS ONE, PLAY THE DARN

120
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:24,400
THING.

121
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:27,203
>> I'M SURE SHE NEEDS MORE TIME

122
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:29,138
IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

123
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:31,807
>> THE FACT THAT IF SHE SIGNED A

124
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:32,775
NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT AND THEN

125
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,213
LEVEL OF TRUST.

126
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:38,981
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, SHE'S

127
00:05:38,982 --> 00:05:39,916
ABOUT SELLING BOOKS RIGHT NOW

128
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,918
AND SHE WANTS TO GET ATTENTION

129
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,222
IN THE MEDIA.

130
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:51,194
IT MAKES FOR GREAT RATINGS.

131
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:54,897
IF ONLY HE DIDN'T TWEET AND CALL

132
00:05:54,898 --> 00:05:56,165
HER A DOG.

133
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,101
>> DOCS WILL START BARKING AT

134
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:01,571
YOU IF YOU IGNORE LONG ENOUGH.

135
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:02,872
>> I WANT TO GET ANDY BACK IN

136
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:04,340
HERE.

137
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:06,175
>> Andy: MELISSA, YOUR POINT

138
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:08,377
ABOUT THE TWEETS IS BIGGER THAN

139
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:08,978
THIS PERSON.

140
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,113
PRESIDENT DECIDED AT A CERTAIN

141
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:14,217
POINT TO HAVE A STRATEGY OF

142
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:20,389
ATTACK RATHER THAN, AS A

143
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:27,396
AND EVERY DAY READ THAT I HAD NO

144
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:29,765
HONOR, THAT I WAS RUNNING A HOAX

145
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:40,443
OR RUNNING A WITCH HUNT, THAT

146
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:42,979
WOULD BE -- THERE'S GOING TO

147
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,781
COME A DAY, WHERE MUELLER IS

148
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:46,949
GOING TO WRITE A REPORT.

149
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,385
IF IT WERE ME, IT WOULD BE TO

150
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:51,187
REPORT TO END ALL REPORTS.

151
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:52,188
IT WOULD BE EXACTING AND EVERY

152
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:54,290
SINGLE THING I COULD COME UP

153
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,425
WITH TO CORROBORATE WHATEVER BAD

154
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:57,760
STUFF I PUT IN THE REPORT.

155
00:06:57,761 --> 00:07:03,766
>> Melissa: YOU MEAN USING THE

156
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:04,100
TWEETS.

157
00:07:04,101 --> 00:00:00,000
>> I WOULD HOPE HE WOULD GO AND
