1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
back in mid December last year I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,040
walking through Oxford Street in central

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,710
London at night and I came across<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> man</font>

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,769
who was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking advertisement he was</font>

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">wearing a bright yellow jacket and on</font>

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,529
the back it said golf sale twice which

7
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,050
to some people may seem like a cliche I

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,900
took a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of the back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his jacket</font>

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,689
and I uploaded it to facebook with the

10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,439
phrase what's a waste of human potential

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,800
dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot and it sparked a lot of</font>

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,540
discussion which is what I was hoping

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,210
for and I was meaning to bring this

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,670
discussion to my youtube channel I just

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,989
haven't had a chance until<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and there</font>

16
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,559
was quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of frustration from</font>

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,010
people with me for daring to post such a

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,410
statement and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually written down</font>

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,910
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the comments I've got here</font>

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,610
comments like at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least he's making an</font>

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,859
attempt to make an honest living I also

22
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,870
find it a bit condescending to judge

23
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,809
what someone does and say it's a waste

24
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,299
someone else put I think you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

25
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider who has the right to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> judge</font>

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,750
whether this man is wasting his

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,180
potential or not I never said without

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,979
knowing anything about the guy you

29
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,920
cannot say anything about him stop

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,890
judging<font color="#E5E5E5"> books by their jackets and for</font>

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,930
me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was quite fascinated by it because</font>

32
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,270
it reminds<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a lot of when Occupy Wall</font>

33
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,140
Street first started because there seems

34
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,770
to be a weird way in which people defend

35
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,159
principles and I just find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a bit</font>

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,890
deluded in some ways so there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

37
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,570
direct correlation between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two</font>

38
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,720
examples but I'm sure you understand why

39
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,670
I'm bringing this up but we've Occupy

40
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,850
Wall Street<font color="#E5E5E5"> um there were a lot of</font>

41
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who were heavily against the</font>

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,969
protesters they were saying stuff like I

43
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,790
work two jobs I have hardly any free

44
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,399
time I'm barely able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bills</font>

45
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,700
listing a lot of genuine concerns about

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,799
why they are struggling in life but then

47
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,800
concluding how dare these people protest

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,830
when I'm putting up with it so

49
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,130
should they when for me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like wait a</font>

50
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,290
minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> no surely you should be on the</font>

51
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,510
side of the protesters because fair

52
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,760
enough you're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard and they've</font>

53
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,280
currently not got jobs but you're on the

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">same team and the the aspect of pride</font>

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,660
and standing up for principal has made

56
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,000
you side with the system which is

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,130
obviously failing the masses so<font color="#E5E5E5"> how does</font>

58
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that relate to this well the fact I said</font>

59
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,770
it's a waste of human potential was not

60
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,570
saying he was a waste of human life I

61
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,580
wasn't saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at all human</font>

62
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,110
potential is obviously about what an

63
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,490
individual could potentially be in their

64
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,810
life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

65
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,630
education system the many forms of the

66
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,280
establishment which I think it turns its

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,860
back on getting the best out of people

68
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,860
but can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you honestly tell me for a</font>

69
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,540
second that that man who is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

70
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">street just walking around wearing a</font>

71
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,990
jacket being a walking advert um are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

72
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,660
telling me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that is the most he can</font>

73
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,230
be in his potential and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people go</font>

74
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,769
well we all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start with bad jobs</font>

75
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,830
and work our way up I understand that

76
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">but at the same time everyone in society</font>

77
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,040
surely can contribute a lot more to

78
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,870
society than that and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why the</font>

79
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,780
system is flawed just walking around um

80
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,780
I guess another example and again when i

81
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,340
give this example some people will

82
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,370
criticize me saying how dare i say this

83
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,550
person's<font color="#E5E5E5"> jobs job is a waste</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when i'm</font>

84
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,010
saying it's obsolete but that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

85
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,200
saying the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to change and</font>

86
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,019
it's when i'm on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the London Underground</font>

87
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:57,959
um I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> told I can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> confirm this</font>

88
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,250
so if song can confirm it that'd be

89
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">brilliant that like the tracking system</font>

90
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,570
on the London Underground is over 40

91
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,800
years old<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason they haven't</font>

92
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,200
updated it with computers is because

93
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,540
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would lose jobs because machines</font>

94
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,820
technology replaces human beings but

95
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who stand on the</font>

96
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,910
platform edge who I have conversations

97
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,668
with every day lovely lovely people who

98
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:19,910
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just trying to make ends meet and</font>

99
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,000
they are making announcements saying you

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,789
know please mind the gap stay clear of

101
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:27,310
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> close</font>

102
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,889
does all these sort of things does a

103
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:32,020
human being actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

104
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,710
when a machine can and I know already am

105
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,850
I saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everyone should be</font>

106
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,990
unemployed no I'm saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system</font>

107
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,500
could actually be reconfigured so that

108
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,990
people can be liberated by technology

109
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,460
and then go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things they</font>

110
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,139
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to there were loads of people in</font>

111
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,840
the Occupy protest who<font color="#CCCCCC"> had studied for</font>

112
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,080
over five years to become doctors and

113
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,580
scientists and then the jobs weren't

114
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,930
there when<font color="#E5E5E5"> surely that there should be</font>

115
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,010
vacancies for people to contribute to

116
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">society so the way that is constructed</font>

117
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,010
and i hope i'm not getting sidetracked

118
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,440
from this issue the point I'm making is

119
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential of that man is I'm sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

120
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,880
has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential and the intelligence</font>

121
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,340
if he was given the tools and the

122
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,200
nurturing by an educator a true

123
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,419
education system or with the right

124
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:24,820
facilities to contribute something much

125
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,000
better to society so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just looking at</font>

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,169
the comments again who do I have a right

127
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:35,320
to judge this man I have a right to

128
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,960
judge his situation because um I think

129
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,960
someone like me who<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a problem with</font>

130
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,490
what he's doing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have a problem</font>

131
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">with him because obviously he's doing it</font>

132
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,229
to support family and it saddens me that

133
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:52,000
the system has created<font color="#CCCCCC"> these pockets</font>

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,070
where people are having to do stuff as

135
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">minuscule as that I've seen people hand</font>

136
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,600
out fliers where the heads down<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

137
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,970
just holding<font color="#E5E5E5"> him up like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that just</font>

138
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">brain-dead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brain-dead and as I say these</font>

139
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,900
things more and more and give these

140
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,720
examples I am not criticizing the

141
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,190
individual what I'm saying is these

142
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,650
people have the potential to be so much

143
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:20,889
more and the frustration I think um it

144
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,410
is with with society as opposed to the

145
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,210
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually something I will do</font>

146
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,789
a video on again sometime because I like

147
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,500
doing these more talkative videos I hope

148
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,460
you enjoy them as I end this ism it is

149
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,440
just World theory if you've heard of the

150
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,840
just world theory and it's that when

151
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,529
human beings look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems in</font>

152
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:44,309
Society in the world you will assess it

153
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:48,089
based on your you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> your original</font>

154
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:50,729
original notion that it's a just world

155
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,959
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't want to criticize it</font>

156
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,699
because subconsciously you believe the

157
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,019
world is just which it isn't and yeah I

158
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,399
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throw it out there for</font>

159
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,799
discussion when you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that photo of</font>
