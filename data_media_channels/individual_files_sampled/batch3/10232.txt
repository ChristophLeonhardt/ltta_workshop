first on Donald Trump's on the final stop nervous lengthy Asian Tories in the Philippines for the ASEAN summit of Southeast Asian leaders later Monday - to hold his first formal talks with President dieter T on the streets of the capital of oh the picture has been far from warm hundreds gathered again in Manila following Sunday's Violet marches against US leaders visit clashes with police saw officers resorts using water cannons to disperse the crowds at some points back to the summit in the business in hand if there's one thing that should be second nature to Donald Trump at gatherings like this it's of course that signature move the presidential handshake but it proved to be a bit of a challenge when he took to the stage with his fellow leaders check this out and now for the ASEAN handshake right over left in one two and three seemless almost so prolly got there in the end now in fairness to Trump he wasn't the only leader to struggle with the choreography there a bit far more important business at hand though was the u.s. leaders positioning himself as a peacemaker in the region's troubled spots including the disputed territorial claims in the resorts rich South China Sea and nadir atutor looks at his next attempt at promoting as services abroad u.s. president Donald Trump the mediator and arbitrator or at least that's what he seems to think let's have a look at the conflicts he's dabbling in Trump suggests he's the one to settle the ongoing dispute involving China Vietnam the Philippines Malaysia and Brunei that's been going on for decades but one of the sides involved thinks Trump should keep his nose out of their business hotheads would like us to confront China and the rest of the world on so many issues the South China Sea is better left untouched nobody can afford to go to war Duterte is certainly not convinced dity and maybe he's right there are at least two major conflicts currently brewing in this region and the longest and bloodiest one is between Israel and Palestine and of course Trump wants to be the man in the middle the Palestinians and Israelis must work together to reach an agreement that I would love to be a mediator or an arbitrator or a facilitator the problem is he appears to be playing games with both sides promising one thing to Palestinians an almost denying he made those promises to Israel is this really how mediation works staying in the region America's allies have been having a bit of a spat of late earlier this summer Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Egypt and Bahrain cut off diplomatic ties with Qatar and started an economic boycott they cited Qatari funding of terrorist groups and later it's increasingly close relationship with Iran as their reasons Trump though claimed he was ready to roll up his sleeves and sort it out I can help mediate between Qatar and in particular the UAE and Saudi Arabia I would be willing to do so and I think you'd have a deal worked out very quickly I think it's something that's going to get solved fairly easily but nearly six months since the fallout nobody's talking so if mediations not proving his forte what about ruffling up those crises already settled the Iran nuclear deal is now in jeopardy thanks to trump d' certifying it the very deal that took a decade of tense talks and negotiations by six nations to agree this is a difficult and dangerous signal it's not up to any single country to terminate it president of united states has many powers not this one renouncing it would be a great error the dialogue control and multilateralism these are the efficient weapons perhaps the Donalds biggest test has been North Korea and again he boasted he'd achieved what his predecessors failed to well Harold I fear we're gonna be able to handle them it'll be it will be handled we handle everything Trump's recipe for success threatened threatened and threatened again we are totally prepared for the second option totally destroy North Korea that's called the military option they will be met with fire and fury tops at with huge military drills and selling weapons to every nation he could during his recent Asia adventure - Prime Minister Japan is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment as he should he will shoot him out of this guy when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States the president and I have agreed they'll be buying a tremendous it makes a lot of sense we make the greatest military equipment in the world and South Korea will be ordering billions of dollars of that equipment which frankly for them makes a lot of sense we make the greatest missiles in the world greatest planes in the world greatest commercial aircraft and so we would like Vietnam divided from us as little doubt Trump's a good businessman but as we asked at the beginning would anyone call him a good mediator and arbitrator Nadira Tudor RT major affairs analyst Andrew Leung told us Donald Trump's offers more about scoring points for the US than actually funding diplomatic solutions here it seems it's more a businessman I mean he his you look at what he has been doing what he has been saying everything is calculated in terms of some sort of tangible gains for the United States that causes problems for countries dealing with the United States because here is American first American always wins that means that the other parties may may lose trumps it sees most office diplomatic activities in terms of monetary gains in terms of you can economic gains for the United States rather than contributing something voluntarily to the global Commons
