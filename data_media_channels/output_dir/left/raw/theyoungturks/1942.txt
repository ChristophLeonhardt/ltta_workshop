1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,290
MIKE POMPEO THE CURRENT CIA
DIRECTOR HAS BEEN CHOSEN BY

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,879
DONALD TRUMP TO REPLACE REX
TILLERSON AS SECRETARY OF STATE.

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:10,950
NATURALLY THE SENATE NEEDS TO
HAVE HEARINGS TO QUESTION

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,730
POMPEO AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR
NOT HE IS FIT FOR THE POSITION.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,640
TO GIVE YOU A QUICK RUNDOWN OF
WHO MIKE POMPEO IS AND WHAT HIS

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,180
BELIEFS ARE, IN THE PAST HE HAS
MADE STATEMENTS DENYING CLIMATE

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,860
CHANGE, OPPOSING SAME-SEX

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
MARRIAGE, ARGUING THAT MODERATE
MUSLIMS ARE COMPLICIT IN

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,380
TERRORIST ATTACKS.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,210
HE IS ALSO DEMONSTRATED ON
VARIOUS OCCASIONS THAT HE HAS

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,399
A HAWKISH STANCE ON
FOREIGN POLICY.

12
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,260
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO
IRAN, NORTH KOREA, SYRIA.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,929
THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT
SENATORS WANTED TO ASK HIM

14
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:48,929
ABOUT.

15
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,769
I COMPILED WHAT I CONSIDERED TO
BE THE MOST INTERESTING

16
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:55,219
EXCHANGES.

17
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:56,429
THE HEARINGS ARE ONGOING.

18
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:00,819
I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE MORE CONTENT
FOR YOU MOVING FORWARD BUT IT'S

19
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:06,180
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW
THERE ARE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:25,560
THAT ARE VERY MUCH CONCERNED
WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,640
MORALE IS LOW WITHIN THE STATE
DEPARTMENT, THERE ARE POSITIONS

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,780
THAT NEED TO BE FILLED WITHIN
THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND RIGHT

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,920
NOW THERE IS AN EFFORT TO
REPLACE REX TILLERSON WITH

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,400
SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE COMPETENT.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:56,090
YOU GET TO DECIDE FOR YOURSELF
WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK THAT.

26
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,530
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE
COMMENTARY FROM SEN.

27
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,860
PAUL AS OPPOSED TO ANSWERS FROM
POMPEO.

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,000
I DO THINK THIS IS AN
INTERESTING EXCHANGE.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,170
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE
FIRST VIDEO.

30
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:13,650
>>DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE THE
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO BOMB

31
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,060
ASAD'S FORCES?

32
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,530
OR INSTALLATIONS?

33
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,860
>>THOSE DECISIONS ARE WAITING
EVERYPLACE WE CAN.

34
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,310
WE SHOULD WORK ALONGSIDE
CONGRESS TO GET THAT BUT YES,

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,599
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT HAS A
DOMESTIC AUTHORITY TO DO THAT.

36
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,790
I DON'T THINK THAT HAS BEEN
DISPUTED BY REPUBLICANS OR

37
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,790
DEMOCRATS THROUGHOUT AN
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.

38
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,689
>>IT WAS DISPUTED BY OUR
FOUNDING FATHERS WHO BELIEVE

39
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:40,799
THEY GAVE THAT AUTHORITY
TO CONGRESS.

40
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:48,939
>>MICHAEL, I WANT YOU TO JUMP
IN AND FILL THE GAPS.

41
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:52,180
>>THERE IS NO GAP TO
FILL IN THERE.

42
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,590
RAND PAUL CALLED HIM OUT ON IT.

43
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:07,099
HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE FREEDOM
CAUCUS, THE MOST 

44
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,099
CONSERVATIVE

45
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,220
GROUP OF CONGRESSMEN.

46
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,900
HE WAS THE WALKING FRIENDS.

47
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:22,709
WHEN HE ADVOCATED AT A TIME WHEN
OBAMA WAS CONSIDERING DOING

48
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,659
CERTAIN THINGS WAS EXACTLY WHAT
RAND PAUL IS SAYING TO HIM NOW.

49
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:31,620
AS HE IS STANDING FOR SECRETARY
OF STATE IT IS A TOTAL REVERSAL.

50
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,669
I THINK A TINY BIT OF LEEWAY IS
GIVEN TO PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING

51
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:40,840
TO ADHERE THE ADMINISTRATION
OF THEIR PRESIDENT.

52
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,420
THIS IS SO FAR FROM THE PERSON
HE WAS AND LEGISLATED AS AND GOT

53
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,900
HIMSELF IN RHETORIC OVER HIS
ADMINISTRATION.

54
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,310
IT IS EMBARRASSING.

55
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:00,549
IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLE HOW HE
TRIED VERY HARD TO PRESENT

56
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:04,639
HIMSELF AS A LESS HAWKISH
INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE AGAIN IF YOU

57
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,290
LOOK AT HIS PAST STATEMENTS HE
DIDN'T WANT TO SHUT DOWN

58
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,040
GUANT¡NAMO BAY, IS VERY MUCH IN

59
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,299
FAVOR OF THE ENHANCED IRRIGATION
THAT WAS CONDUCTED UNDER BUSH,

60
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,358
BASICALLY TORTURE.

61
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,229
DURING THIS HEARING WHAT I
NOTICED WAS THAT HE WANTED TO

62
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,349
PRESENT HIMSELF AS SOMEONE WHO
WAS MORE IN FAVOR OF DIPLOMACY.

63
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:33,000
HISTORICALLY IT IS NOT THE CASE
WITH MIKE POMPEO.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,870
>>THE TRUTH IS YOU PRESENT
YOURSELF IS WHAT YOU THINK THEY

65
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,240
WANT TO HEAR AND THAT IS WHAT
HE IS DOING TODAY.

66
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:48,020
>>WE HAVE CROSSED INTO A PERIOD
WHERE CONSERVATIVES, THERE IS

67
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,300
ALMOST NO PRINCIPLE AND THEIR

68
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,750
PARTISANSHIP WHILE ACCUSING
DEMOCRATS OF BEING PARTISAN ñ

69
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,160
THEY ARE OUT OF CONTROL.

70
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,639
THERE IS NO PRINCIPLE ON
WHICH THEY STAND.

71
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,220
THE FREEDOM CAUCUS THEORETICALLY
WANTED LIMITED GOVERNMENT.

72
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:26,020
AND THE THOUGHT WAS AT LEAST
THOSE GUYS ARE PRINCIPLED.

73
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:32,699
THIS WAS WHAT WORKED, THIS IS
WHAT WAS POPULAR.

74
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,720
HE IS A BETTER NOMINEE FOR
SECRETARY OF STATE THAN REX

75
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,580
TILLERSON BECAUSE HE WAS A ZERO

76
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:44,530
ON A 1 TO 10 SCALE BUT IT IS A
CONTINUED DISASTER.

77
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,060
>>DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU WOULD
BE BETTER THAN REX TILLERSON?

78
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,509
WHILE REX TILLERSON DIDN'T HAVE
THE SAME CONTACTS, CONNECTIONS,

79
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:57,439
EXPERIENCE, POMPEO IS DEFINITELY
MORE HAWKISH THAN TILLER'S IN.

80
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:03,760
>>I THINK REX TILLERSON IS THE
WORST CABINET APPOINTMENT IN

81
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,030
THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.

82
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,030
I THINK HE HAS WRECKED THE
STATE DEPARTMENT.

83
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,030
IT IS COUNTERINTUITIVE IN ANY
WAY TO MAKE PROGRESS.

84
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,030
>>IT WAS LIKE APPOINTING A
SURGEON TO HOUSING AND URBAN

85
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,030
DEVELOPMENT.

86
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,030
>>TILLER SEND AGAIN, WE LIKED
THEM A LITTLE BECAUSE HE

87
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,030
RECOGNIZED TRUMPS MORONITY.

88
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,030
THIS
IS STILL A GUY WHO RAN A GIANT

89
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,030
OIL COMPANY.

90
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:23,150
THEY HAD THEIR OWN FOREIGN
SERVICE, AND OWN MILITARY AT

91
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,150
EXXON.

92
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:44,340
TO 
THEM 

93
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:55,030
TO 

94
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,240
STATE DEPARTMENT
DIPLOMACY WAS TIGHTENING OF

95
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:08,020
THEIR BELTS, IT INFRINGED ON
THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE A PROFIT.

96
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,689
AS BAD AS BEN CARSON IS, THE
DAMAGE THEY COULD DO IS SO

97
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:15,080
LIMITED IN COMPARISON TO THE
STATE DEPARTMENT, I AM NOT

98
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,780
DELIGHTED THAT MIKE POMPEO IS
THERE, HE IS A HORRIBLE CHOICE.

99
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,620
TO LISTEN WAS WORSE.

100
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:28,600
>>TO THIS POINT A REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSMAN IN DC SAID TO ME

101
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,169
THAT MIKE POMPEO IS UNQUALIFIED

102
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:36,830
BUT AMBITIOUS AND WITHIN THESE
SPHERES ADMISSION IS WINNING.

103
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,479
>>AMBITION IS SCARY WHEN IT
COMES TO SOMEONE LIKE POMPEO.

104
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,530
MY WORRY IS THAT HE IS MORE
ALIGNED WITH TRUMP WHEN IT

105
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,250
COMES TO THE WORST IDEAS THAT
TRUMP HAS IN FOREIGN POLICY.

106
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,340
>>I DON'T DISAGREE.

107
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,639
>>I KNOW TILLOTSON WASN'T A
MITIGATING FACTOR.

108
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,060
TRUMPED AND REALLY RESPECT HIM.

109
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,689
HE WAS JUST AS MARGINALIZED AS
KELLY.

110
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:11,090
>>BUT HE DID MEDICATE ON THE
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

111
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,870
IT WAS TILLER SINCE VOICE IN THE
ROOM THAT CAUSED THE PRESIDENT

112
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,770
NOT TO GO ALL THE WAY.

113
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:30,330
>>THIS IS 
A CRAZY CONVERSATION

114
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,669
THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE IN AMERICA.

115
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:34,039
WHO DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE
SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON

116
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,099
OR MIKE POMPEO?

117
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,349
IT IS A JOKE CONVERSATION.

118
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,390
THEY ARE BOTH TERRIBLE IN THEIR
OWN INTERESTING WAYS.

119
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,970
ONE OF THE WAYS THAT POMPEO IS
DANGEROUS IS THAT HE COULD

120
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,639
APPEAL TO TRUMPS MOST

121
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,459
INTERVENTIONIST DARKEST, MOST
MILITANTLY BELLIGERENT SIDE.

122
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:53,459
>>ACTUALLY WANT TO SKIP AHEAD
TO THE VIDEO WHERE POMPEO AND

123
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:54,459
RAND PAUL ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

124
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:55,500
IRAQ WAR AND WHETHER OR NOT
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

125
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

126
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,900
>>DO THINK THE IRAQ WAR
WAS A MISTAKE?

127
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,110
>>I WAS RUNNING A MACHINE SHOP
IN KANSAS AT THE TIME.

128
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,130
>>HOW ABOUT OPINIONS NOW?

129
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,300
>>
I MAY WELL HAVE HAD AN OPINION.

130
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,910
BUT MY OPINION NOW AS WE CLEARLY
HAD BAD INTELLIGENCE.

131
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,889
>>BUT IT'S NOT JUST BAD
INTELLIGENCE, WE DID

132
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,019
GEOPOLITICALLY THE WRONG THING.

133
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:20,800
WE GOT RID OF THE ENEMY OF IRAN,
BE EMBOLDENED IRAN, WE BROUGHT

134
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,910
CHAOS TO THE MIDDLE EAST.

135
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,220
YOUR PRESIDENT SAID THE IRAQ WAR
WAS THE SINGLE WORST DECISION

136
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,399
EVER MADE.

137
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,279
I AM CONCERNED THAT YOU WON'T BE
SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT, THAT

138
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,840
YOU WILL BE INFLUENCING HIM IN A
WAY THAT I THINK HIS

139
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,480
INCLINATIONS ARE BETTER THAN
MANY OF HIS ADVISERS.

140
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,350
THAT THE IRAQ WAR WAS A MISTAKE,
THAT WE NEED TO COME HOME FROM

141
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,620
AFGHANISTAN.

142
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,529
HE WAS AGAINST BEING INVOLVED IN
SYRIA AT MANY TIMES IN HIS

143
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:48,450
CAREER SO I THINK HE DOES HAVE
GOOD INSTINCTS.

144
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,580
WILL YOU BE LISTENING TO WHAT
THE PRESIDENT WANTS INSTEAD OF

145
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,970
BEING SOMEONE WHO ADVOCATES FOR
US STAYING FOREVER IN

146
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,910
AFGHANISTAN, ANOTHER IRAQ WAR,
BOMBING SYRIA WITHOUT

147
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,910
PERMISSION.

148
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,550
THESE ARE THE ADVICE YOU
WILL GIVE.

149
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,880
>>ANYTIME THEY ARE ASKED ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE THEM

150
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,350
LOOK BAD IF THEY ANSWERED
TRUTHFULLY THEY DON'T RECALL.

151
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:18,290
>>THESE ARE UNBELIEVABLE TIMES
AND I AM REMINDED OF SPRINGSTEEN

152
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,290
RADIO.

153
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:33,440
THERE ARE 

154
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,589
TWO THINGS HERE THAT
WOULD MAKE EVERY REPUBLICAN NOT

155
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:44,800
VOTE FOR THEM IF ñ THE COMMITTEE
WOULD SAY WE CAN'T SUPPORT THIS

156
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,339
GUY, ONE HE SAYS I WAS RUNNING A
MACHINE SHOP IN KANSAS AT THE

157
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,339
TIME.

158
00:10:51,339 --> 00:11:00,560
YOU CAN'T HAVE THE JOB THEN.

159
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,910
I WANT SOMEBODY ELSE WITH
AN OPINION.

160
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,630
AND HE SAYS INTERESTING BECAUSE
THE CONSENSUS IS WE MADE A

161
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,630
MISTAKE.

162
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,110
SOME ANSWER THAT SUGGESTS YOU
THOUGHT ABOUT IT, NOT I WAS

163
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,270
RUNNING A MACHINE SHOP I'M NOT
GOING TO ANSWER.

164
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,570
AND THEN RAND PAUL WAS GOING TO
BE CHAMPIONED ON THE LEFT AND

165
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,380
RIGHT FOR STANDING UP AND
RECOGNIZING THE MISTAKE WE MADE.

166
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,470
IN THE MIDDLE THAT UNDERMINES
THE CREDIBILITY AND SAYS I THINK

167
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,810
TRUMP HAS GOOD INSTINCTS.

168
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,010
NO, HE HAS INCOMPETENT
INSTINCTS.

169
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,889
DIFFERENT PAUL WAS TRUE, HE
WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT THORN

170
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:37,949
IN DONALD TRUMP SIDE INSTEAD
OF THE FAKE THORN.

171
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:47,420
MY HUNCH IS THAT HE GAVE HIS
ANSWER TO RAND PAUL.

172
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:57,050
IT IS SO NONSENSICAL AND WE HAVE
SEEN TWO REASONS WHY THIS GUY

173
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,730
SHOULD NEVER BE SECRETARY
OF STATE.

174
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,180
>>A LOT OF THE STUFF IS
POLITICAL THEATER, AND ATTEMPT

175
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,360
TO MAKE SURE THEIR CONSTITUENTS

176
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,889
SEE THAT THEY ARE SPEAKING
STRONGLY ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY

177
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,500
SUPPORT.

178
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,410
AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE SENATE
HEARINGS WITH MARK ZUCKERBERG.

179
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,350
>>THAT IS THE BEST EXAMPLE.

180
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,720
>>IT WASN'T EVEN ABOUT
PROTECTING DATA OR PRIVACY.

181
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,570
IT WAS ABOUT I AM A CONSERVATIVE
LAWMAKER AND I AM VERY

182
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,170
OUTRAGED THAT YOU ARE CENSORING
CONSERVATIVES.

183
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:36,180
>>WHEN THERE IS A SEXY WITNESS
EVERYONE IN CONGRESS ñ

184
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:46,140
>>THEY WERE INTERVIEWING
ZUCKERBERG FOR A JOB.

185
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,470
RAND PAUL ASKED QUESTIONS THAT
TAUGHT US SOMETHING.

186
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,560
BUT IT WON'T MATTER.

187
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:04,269
THAT IS 

188
00:13:04,269 --> 00:00:00,000
WHAT GETS ME.
