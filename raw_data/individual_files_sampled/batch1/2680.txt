we actually had somebody who was working in our brand development I could tell he wasn't happy so I want to get him to tell me to go F myself he didn't tell me to go after myself but he did tell me I could look his good now we're really talking about something that's important the fu rule or the peer rule goes like this at Boston Beer Company it's okay to say you to anybody including me you have to explain to the person that you gave the fu to why you said that what they did to make you feel in that special fu frame mind and then be willing to listen to their side of the story if you get that out on the table and you do it in a respectful way of each listening to the other then you can resolve the problem but if you never put it out on the table the problem just Fester's and gets worse and causes other problems so what you know we want to do is liberate people even it's gonna cause stress and tension and conflict those are all good things and if you bottle it up you make things undiscussables once you bring it to their attention and talk about it you'll settle it
