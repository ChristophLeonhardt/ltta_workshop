1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,970
afternoon all I thought I'd take a few
moments to offer a few comments on the

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:13,200
strategy for South Asia that President
Trump outlined last night in his address

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,170
to the nation and then take a few your
questions on that subject I think the

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,910
president did a big fairly thorough job
in terms of describing the new military

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,920
approach I think the important point in
that is a conditions-based approach as

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,739
opposed to a time-based approach that
had specified troop ceiling levels and

7
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,149
timetables and I think the president's
been quite clear that what is will be

8
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,579
different this time is he has empowered
our military commanders on the ground to

9
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,500
make more timely decisions to conduct
battlefield operations based upon the

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,539
conditions on the ground with the battle
plans that secretary deficient mattis

11
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,120
will be approving that is going to
change the dynamic on the ground

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,290
considerably these are some of the same
tactics that have been employed in the

13
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,229
very successful campaign to defeat Isis
in Syria and Iraq and so I think we're

14
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,220
taking a lot of lessons learned from our
success there and we'll translate those

15
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,439
to Afghanistan this is going to take
some time for our military to go through

16
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,820
a new set of training with some of the
Afghan forces the fighting will still be

17
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,460
borne by the Afghan forces by their
military and their security forces but

18
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,930
we believe we can turn the tide of what
has been a losing battle over the last

19
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,369
year and a half or so and at least
stabilize the situation and hopefully

20
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,360
start seeing some battlefield victories
on the part of the Afghan forces who

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,619
have fought very bravely but they've
been fighting I think with less than

22
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,850
full capabilities that we can give them
I think similarly on the diplomatic

23
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,610
front we too are going to adopt a
conditions-based diplomacy we're going

24
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,659
to condition our efforts along with the
progress we see being made by the Afghan

25
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,979
government who must continue the reform
efforts that we've been working on for

26
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,530
some time in a particular much more
rigorous efforts around the

27
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,860
anti-corruption now part of the
corruption challenge in some respects

28
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,330
has been the methods and ways in which
we have been delivering some of our aid

29
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,250
and we've not been as accountable I
think to ourselves in terms of ensuring

30
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,690
that our aid programs development
programs are delivering the results that

31
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,770
they were intended to deliver some of
that has been challenged by the security

32
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,790
environment it's very difficult for many
of our aid workers to operate in

33
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,740
Afghanistan so as the security
environment improves we expect to adopt

34
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,520
a different approach as to how we
deliver on the development and

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,170
assistance that supports the Afghan
government in their reforms as well I

36
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,060
think the president was clear this
entire effort is intended to put

37
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,130
pressure on the Taliban to have a
Taliban understanding you will not win a

38
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,900
battlefield victory we may not win one
but neither will you and so at some

39
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,980
point we have to come to the negotiating
table and find a way to bring this to an

40
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,890
end now this is a regional approach and
part of why this effort took as long as

41
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,440
it did is we chose not to just focus on
Afghanistan but we undertook a fairly

42
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,850
comprehensive review of our
relationships in Pakistan and our

43
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,650
relationship with India and we see this
approach as requiring an integration of

44
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:36,070
all three of those strategies and use
Pakistan India to also bring pressure to

45
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:41,590
bear on the situation Afghanistan
Pakistan in particular can play an

46
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,010
important role here certainly on
delivering the Taliban to the

47
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,080
negotiating table Pakistan has suffered
acts of terrorism their citizens have

48
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,840
suffered acts of terrorism is I think is
dramatic as any we've seen anywhere and

49
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,980
we stand ready to help Pakistan address
terrorist organizations inside of their

50
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:06,370
country but they must they must adopt a
different approach themselves Pakistan

51
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,060
and the u.s. historically had very good
relationships but over the last few

52
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,130
years there's been a real erosion in the
confidence between our two governments

53
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,269
there's been an erosion and Trust
because we have witnessed terrorist

54
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,830
organizations being given safe haven
inside of Pakistan to plan to carry out

55
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,840
attacks against the US service
US officials disrupting peace efforts

56
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,760
inside of Afghanistan Pakistan must
adopt a different approach and we are

57
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,560
ready to work with them to help them
protect themselves against these

58
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,940
terrorist organizations but certainly to
begin to end their attacks that are

59
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,190
disrupting our efforts at peace we are
going to be conditioning our support for

60
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,400
Pakistan and our relationship with them
on them delivering results in this area

61
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,170
we want to work with Pakistan in a
positive way but they must change their

62
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,740
approach
India's emerging is a very important

63
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,920
regional strategic partner with the
United States and has played an

64
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,270
important role supporting Afghan
government and in particular supporting

65
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,110
their economy it is a provided
developmental assistance they provided

66
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,940
economic assistance they are hosting an
important economic conference in India

67
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,100
this next week all of that is important
to stabilizing Afghanistan as a nation

68
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,810
get their economy functioning stabilize
the country so that they can provide

69
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,280
more opportunities to their citizens
these are all elements of what will lead

70
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,570
to stability and ultimately a peace
agreement but the effort is again a

71
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:43,270
regional effort put pressure on the
parties to understand that this fighting

72
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:48,550
is going to take everyone nowhere and
it's time to begin a process it may very

73
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,640
well be a lengthy process of
reconciliation and a peace accord and

74
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,210
Afghanistan as the president said can
choose its form of government that best

75
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,140
suits the needs of its people as long as
it rejects terrorism never provides

76
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,890
territory in Afghanistan to provide safe
haven for terrorists and accommodates

77
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:14,290
all the groups represented inside of
Afghanistan ethnic groups and others how

78
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,250
they want to organize themselves is up
to them but we have to recognize that

79
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:23,290
their culture is a tribal culture and
their history accommodates the nature of

80
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,260
those relationships there's no reason
their former government cannot

81
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,610
accommodate that as well so we want to
facilitate a reconciliation peace

82
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,960
process and we will facilitate them
coming to some conclusion around how

83
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,860
they want to govern themselves that's
really the essence of the

84
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,139
strategy and before taking your
questions I do want to make one comment

85
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:50,620
on North Korea I think it is worth
noting that we have had no missile

86
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,240
launches or provocative acts on the part
of North Korea since the unanimous

87
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,849
adoption of the UN Security Council
resolution I want to take note of that I

88
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:07,180
want to acknowledge it I'm I am pleased
to see that the regime in Pyongyang has

89
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,310
has certainly demonstrated some level of
restraint that we've not seen in the

90
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,770
past we hope that this is the beginning
of this signal that we've been looking

91
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,479
for that they are ready to restrain
their level of tensions they're ready to

92
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,000
restrain the provocative acts and the
perhaps we are seeing our pathway to

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,050
sometime in the near future having some
dialogue we need to see more on their

94
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,319
part but I want to acknowledge the steps
they've taken thus far I think it's

95
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:40,620
important to take note of that so with
that I'm happy to take your questions

96
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:49,150
thanks I'll be really brief it seems
like to me at least that with a no

97
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:54,009
nation-building concept of the president
laid out last night and what you just

98
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,389
said that the main difference other than
the time table part of the military

99
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:02,349
stuff the main difference between this
new approach and the old one is that

100
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:06,759
you're eliminating 2/3 of what used to
be known as the clear hold and build

101
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:13,449
strategy in other words week we clear or
you clear you hold and we won't build

102
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:19,779
you will so if that's correct what
happens to the anti-corruption efforts

103
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:24,789
that you mentioned the good governance
the counter-narcotics the education

104
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:30,370
programs what happens to those and more
specifically what would it was that

105
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,779
going to mean for particularly Afghan
women and girls who have been assured

106
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,589
for the last 16 years by two separate
administration's that they wouldn't be

107
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:42,399
abandoned well I don't want to suggest
that there's that dramatic a difference

108
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,410
in terms of our expectations for Afghan
government performance and as you point

109
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,040
out there's been enormous strides
achieved in Afghanistan both in terms of

110
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,470
the numbers of millions of children that
are now in schools being educated the

111
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,220
role of women in Afghani

112
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,450
I don't expect any of that to be rolled
back I think that has become part of the

113
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,280
Afghan government structures become part
of what the Afghan people themselves I

114
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,350
think expect if you go back many years
ago prior to all of this disruption that

115
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,960
was Afghanistan that was the nature of
Afghanistan 30 40 50 years ago so I

116
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,400
think it is part of their culture
already we want to support that in terms

117
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,200
of the the clear and hold that is still
the approach is that areas will be

118
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,970
cleared and Afghan security forces can
hold those areas thereby enabling some

119
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,110
growth in the Afghan economy part of
what Afghanistan struggles unders they

120
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:45,200
do not have control over but a portion
of their economy so as the forces are

121
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,430
able to either hold areas and stabilize
them so need not give up further ground

122
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,870
and they're still losing ground today as
you well know so this is going to take a

123
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,100
little while but is to stabilize and
then hopefully begin to regain control

124
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,990
and his ground is gained it will be held
by Afghan security forces while allowing

125
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,590
the Afghan government to continue what
it has been very successfully doing

126
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:12,020
under our assistance now for many years
and not rollback any of those gains that

127
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,320
have been made that's I don't think
that's the aspiration of the Afghan

128
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,700
government or the Afghan people either
so what we're going to continue to help

129
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,260
them institutionally we may be taking
different approaches and not putting so

130
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,910
much of the US taxpayer dollar on the
ground building schools and building

131
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,660
infrastructures we think there are
plenty of others that we're going to

132
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,610
call upon for assistance as well rather
we're there to facilitate and ensure

133
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,930
that there is a pathway for
reconciliation and peace talks as this

134
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,580
pressure begins to take hold and we do
we believe we already know there are

135
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:52,190
certain moderate elements of the Taliban
who we think are going to be ready and

136
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,890
want to help develop a way forward how
long that will take will be again based

137
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:03,260
on conditions on the ground
thank you very much mr. secretary a

138
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,830
question that embraces both the military
side and the diplomatic side on the

139
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,720
military side what the new rules of
engagement means that in the short term

140
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,160
at least our forces will be more at risk
because they will be potentially doing

141
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,300
night raids against the Taliban again
not just training but actually

142
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:28,080
supporting in a more active role because
the Afghan troops are not all up to par

143
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,680
here to push back against the Taliban
events and on the diplomatic side why

144
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,330
didn't the president mention Russia's
rearming of the Taliban which general

145
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:44,040
Nicholson has been talking about very
openly you can to be letting Russia off

146
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,920
the hook in his speech and do you have
enough people given the fact that they

147
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,820
were not trump confirmed diplomatic
appointees in many of these positions in

148
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,690
the region along the on the military
operations out of it I would really

149
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,610
defer to the Department of Defense to
answer that one other than I know the

150
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,880
approach is going to be as I said
similar to what we have had success

151
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,280
elsewhere this secretary match describes
it it's a by with and through approach

152
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,020
and I think that's part of why the need
for step up in troop levels is so we can

153
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,420
now at the battalion level organize and
help Afghan army fight in a different

154
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,180
way with closed ground advisement at the
battalion level and the ability to call

155
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,280
in support on a more timely basis as
needed to ensure victory as opposed to

156
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:41,220
either stalemate or defeat with respect
to the comment about Russia to the

157
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,950
extent Russia is supplying arms to the
Taliban that is a violation obviously of

158
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:52,950
international norms is a violation of UN
Security Council norms we certainly

159
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,030
would object to that and call Russia
attention to that if anyone's going to

160
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:02,010
supply arms it needs to be through the
Afghan government in terms of our

161
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,420
footprint on the ground we have very
competent capable experienced people

162
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,160
there now our Afghan ambassadors
remaining on the job at this time we

163
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,670
have a Pakistan ambassador that's been
nominated with

164
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,810
to have that person cleared through the
process soon and even in the transition

165
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,470
in Afghanistan as ambassador hell
transitions out we've nominated

166
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:26,330
ambassador bass very experienced
diplomat been chief been running the

167
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,650
embassy in Ankara Turkey very complex
place he's very well equipped to step

168
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,150
into this situation as well and we are
looking at a couple of different people

169
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,560
for the Special Representative to
Afghanistan and Pakistan position it's

170
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,270
open currently it's being filled with a
very experienced individual today so

171
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,870
we're ready to get going with very
confident people we have and I'm not at

172
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,400
all concerned about the competency level
or the experience of the people that we

173
00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:01,160
have working on this I'm quite confident
with them India secretary Tillerson I

174
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,370
know you don't want to talk about about
the military but you were just using

175
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:10,220
some military terms and battalion level
and that I know and understand why the

176
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,930
administration does not want to talk
about tactical moves but strategy don't

177
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,760
the American people deserve to know
approximately how many more their sons

178
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,150
and daughters will be going back to
Afghanistan in a war that's lasted

179
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,980
nearly 16 years well I think not again I
want to speak secretary matters but I

180
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,420
think the intent is there will be
visibility to troop levels once the

181
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,560
decision has been made I think what the
president has conveyed and I agree

182
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,320
wholeheartedly with him is that we are
not going to signal ahead what our plans

183
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,850
are we're not going to signal ahead and
increase that decrease the timing of any

184
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,370
of that it will be driven by conditions
on the ground the only way we can defeat

185
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:58,700
an enemy that is as nimble and is cagey
tactically is this enemy is we have to

186
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,950
be as cagey and tactical as they are and
we've not been fighting that way could

187
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:09,470
that include strikes in Pakistan I'm not
going to comment on what it could

188
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,810
include
but the president's been clear that we

189
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,640
are going to protect American troops and
servicemen we are going to attack

190
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,470
terrorists wherever they live and we
have put people on notice that if you

191
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:27,350
are harboring and providing safe haven
to terrorists be warned be forewarned

192
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,900
and we're going to engage with those who
are providing safe haven and ask them to

193
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:37,700
change what they're doing and help us
help them because in my view the best

194
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,620
the greatest benefactor other than the
Afghan people themself to achieving

195
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,150
stability and peace in Afghanistan are
the people of Pakistan they will benefit

196
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:58,760
more than any other nation you said no
preconditions to talks specifically are

197
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,560
you saying that the u.s. no longer
expects the Taliban to accept the Afghan

198
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,360
Constitution and specifically the rights
of women and on Pakistan did you

199
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,270
articulate in specific terms or do you
plan to to Pakistan the consequences of

200
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:20,300
their actions whether it be sanctions
dropping their non-nato allies status I

201
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,130
mean what exactly have you communicated
or do you plan to communicate well I had

202
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:29,120
a good call with the Prime Minister of
Pakistan yesterday afternoon to give

203
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,740
them a bit of a forewarning of what they
were going to hear in the President's

204
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,690
speech and also we did touch on the
points I've made to you today we are

205
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:44,540
going to be engaging with them in a very
serious and thorough way as to our

206
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,520
expectations and the conditions that go
with that and all of those things you

207
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,460
just listed are on the table for
discussion if in fact they are unwilling

208
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:01,850
to change their posture or change their
approach to how they're dealing with the

209
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,800
numerous terrorist organizations that
find safe haven inside of Pakistan again

210
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,329
it is in Pakistan's interest to take
those actions when we say no

211
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,500
preconditions on the talks I think what
we are saying is look the government of

212
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,280
Afghanistan and the Taliban
representatives need to sit down and

213
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,569
sort this out it's not for the u.s. to
tell them it must be this particular

214
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:27,109
model that must be under these
conditions I think that's what the

215
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:31,550
president means when he says we're no
longer nation-building we're look we've

216
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,380
tried taking certain principles and
forms around the world and sometimes it

217
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,000
works in a lot of places it doesn't work
we don't know what's

218
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,640
merge here we're going to be there
obviously to encourage others but it's

219
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,150
going to be up to the Afghan government
and the representatives of the Taliban

220
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,740
to work through a reconciliation process
of what will serve their needs and

221
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,679
achieve the American peoples objectives
which is security no safe haven for

222
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:06,520
terrorists to operate anywhere in
Afghanistan now or in the future mr.

223
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,110
secretary you mentioned the force
protection concerns and ambassador bass

224
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,360
sort shortly going to Afghanistan and
the S Rapp discussions but how are you

225
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,190
going to get someone who is able to go
out beyond the wire and negotiate

226
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,419
functionally regularly in that weekly
basis with individuals from the Haqqani

227
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:29,679
network and that force protection
concern well we are going to have to

228
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,030
improve the security environment it is
not the environment today is not

229
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:39,070
conducive to carrying out those types of
activities you're exactly right and so

230
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,510
part of what we're going to have to do
is first ensure we're ready to engage

231
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:49,419
when conditions permit us to engage
again why Pakistan is very important in

232
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:53,890
this discussion as well Pakistan can
facilitate much of that discussion and

233
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,539
there are other regional players to
which this this particular conflict and

234
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:03,970
this unstable situation in Afghanistan
are important we've had discussions with

235
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,440
the Chinese about a role they might be
able to play we've had discussions with

236
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,950
the Russians about the role they could
play if they choose to

237
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,840
and certainly regional players in the
Gulf GCC member countries are very

238
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,640
interested in seeing this area and
Afghanistan stabilized as well so there

239
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,809
are a lot of partners out here on the
periphery that I think will have from

240
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,919
time to time important roles they can
play ultimately it comes down to the two

241
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:40,090
parties the Afghan government and the
Taliban representatives going back to

242
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,169
Pakistan officials for quite some time
Democratic and Republican

243
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:51,190
administrations have tried to get the
government to stop it stop giving safe

244
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,530
haven to the Haqqani network terrorist
group

245
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,840
what leverage do you think you have well
I think it's obviously we have some

246
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,260
leverage that's been discussed in terms
of the amount of aid and military

247
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:08,500
assistance we give them their statuses
as a non NATO alliance partner all of

248
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,550
that can be put on the table but you
know at the end of the day Pakistan has

249
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:18,220
to decide what is in Pakistan best
long-term interest from a security

250
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,230
standpoint for themselves and for their
people quite frankly as I evaluate

251
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,460
Pakistan's current situation if I were
the Pakistan government I would be I

252
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:33,400
would have growing concerns about the
strength of the Taliban and other

253
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,810
organizations inside of Pakistan who
seem to be growing their numbers in

254
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:42,250
their presence to the point that at some
point they become a real threat to the

255
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,420
stability of the Pakistani government
itself I think they need to be thinking

256
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,770
about what is in their best long-term
interest and how can we work with them

257
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:57,970
to achieve a safer more stable Pakistan
in the next decades to come as well I

258
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,200
think it really is up to them they've
got to ask themselves that question why

259
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,300
is why does this work for them and why
is this going to be going to continue to

260
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,020
support their stability and the survival
of their government in the years ahead

261
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,580
if they continue to allow these elements
to just grow and maintain their presence

262
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:26,740
inside of Pakistan don't you fear on the
other side that too much pressure to

263
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:35,170
pressure on Pakistan may destabilize the
can Islamabad and may have disguising

264
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:42,160
all the region with the having Taliban
stronger in the country that is a

265
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,550
concern and that's why I made the
comments I just made that I think it's

266
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,380
important to Pakistan begin to think
about its ability to contain these

267
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,880
groups as well it's why though we take a
regional approach the US alone is not

268
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,060
going to change this dynamic with
Pakistan

269
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,750
you know India and Pakistan they have
their own issues that they have to

270
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,429
continue to work through but I think
there are areas where perhaps even

271
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:11,289
India can take some steps of reproach
mulling issues with Pakistan to improve

272
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:15,580
the stability within Pakistan and remove
some of the reasons why they deal with

273
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,809
these unstable elements inside their own
country as I said other regional players

274
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:25,659
have strong interest in Pakistan China
has strong interest in Pakistan having a

275
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:31,299
stable secure future Pakistan is in a
lot of our interest they are a nuclear

276
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:35,710
power we have concerns about their
weapons the security of their weapons

277
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,259
there are many areas in which we believe
we should be having very productive

278
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:45,460
dialogue that serves both of our
interests and regional interests as well

279
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,710
so this is again this is not a situation
where the u.s. is saying look it's just

280
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:55,480
us and you what our approach is to bring
as I said these regional approaches is

281
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:01,330
to bring all the other interests into
this effort much as we've done with

282
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,590
North Korea and assembling this global
effort in North Korea I think too often

283
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,749
we try to distill these these challenges
down to where it's just the US and some

284
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:14,619
other country and only between the two
of us can we solve it we have to enlarge

285
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:19,480
the circle of interest and bring others
to into the effort as well and that's

286
00:23:19,480 --> 00:00:00,000
what we'll be doing with Pakistan as
well
