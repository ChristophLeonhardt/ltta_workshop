OF MALIGNED FOREIGN INFLUENCE 

375
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,310
OPERATIONS TARGETING OUR 

376
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,345
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND OUR 

377
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:46,612
VALUES. 

378
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,415
THE TASK FORCE NOW BRINGS 

379
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,551
TOGETHER ACROSS THE WATERFRONT 

380
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:52,818
OF F.B.I. 

381
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,087
EXPERTISE, WE'RE TALKING 

382
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:55,688
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE, CYBER, 

383
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,656
CRIMINAL AND EVEN 

384
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,425
COUNTERTERRORISM DESIGNED TO 

385
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,662
ROOT OUT AND RESPOND TO FOREIGN 

386
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:04,129
INFLUENCE OPERATIONS. 

387
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:06,065
FOR THEIR PART, OUR ADVERSARIES 

388
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:06,966
INFLUENCE OPERATIONS HAVE 

389
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,168
ENCOMPASSED A WIDE RANGE OF 

390
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:09,568
ACTIVITIES. 

391
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,804
SO JUST LIKE WE HAVE A MULTI-

392
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,038
DISCIPLINARY RESPONSE, THAT'S 

393
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:14,039
BECAUSE THE THREAT IS MULTI-

394
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,372
DISCIPLINARY. 

395
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:15,441
SO JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF SOME 

396
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,544
OF THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN OVER 

397
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,347
THE PAST, TARGETING U.S. 

398
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,114
OFFICIALS AND OTHER U.S. 

399
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,648
PERSONS THROUGH TRADITIONAL 

400
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:25,451
INTELLIGENCE TRADE CRAFT, 

401
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,654
CRIMINAL EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS 

402
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,422
VOTING AND PROVIDE ILLEGAL 

403
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,956
CAMPAIGN FINANCING, CYBER 

404
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,059
ATTACKS AGAINST VOTING 

405
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,560
INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG WITH 

406
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,194
COMPUTER INTRUSIONS TARGETING 

407
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,862
ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OTHERS, 

408
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,765
AND A WHOLE SLEW OF OTHER KINDS 

409
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:44,270
OF INFLUENCE LIKE BOTH OVERTLY 

410
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,540
AND COVERTLY MANIPULATING NEWS 

411
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,374
STORIES, SPREADING 

412
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,341
DISINFORMATION, LEVERAGING 

413
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,042
ECONOMIC RESOURCES AND 

414
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:50,609
ESCALATING DIVISIVE ISSUES. 

415
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,143
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO 

416
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:54,847
UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT JUST AN 

417
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,115
ELECTION CYCLE THREAT. 

418
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,449
OUR ADVERSARIES ARE TRYING  TO 

419
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:59,518
UNDERMINE OUR COUNTRY ON A 

420
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,087
PERSISTENT AND REGULAR BASIS, 

421
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:03,789
WHETHER IT'S ELECTION SEASON OR 

422
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:04,056
NOT. 

423
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,090
THERE'S A CLEAR DISTINCTION 

424
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,859
BETWEEN ON THE ONE HAND 

425
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,595
ACTIVITIES THAT THREATEN THE 

426
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,229
SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF OUR 

427
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,864
ELECTIONS SYSTEMS AND ON THE 

428
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,166
OTHER HAND THE BROADER THREAT 

429
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,367
OF INFLUENCE OPERATIONS 

430
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,135
DESIGNED TO MANIPULATE AND 

431
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:19,405
INFLUENCE OUR VOTERS AND THEIR 

432
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,039
OPINIONS. 

433
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,640
WITH OUR PARTNERS WE'RE TRYING 

434
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,807
TO COUNTERACT BOTH THREATS. 

435
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:25,244
WE HAVE THREE PILLARS TO OUR 

436
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:25,711
OPERATIONAL STRATEGY. 

437
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,746
THE FIRST PILLAR IS OUR 

438
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:28,814
INVESTIGATIONS AND OUR 

439
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:29,114
OPERATIONS. 

440
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:30,649
AND FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS 

441
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,085
WHICH I HOPE ARE OBVIOUS AND 

442
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,052
INCLUDING OPERATIONAL 

443
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:34,787
SENSITIVITIES, I'M NOT GOING TO 

444
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,855
BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE THE FULL 

445
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,489
EXTENT OF THOSE EFFORTS, BUT I 

446
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:40,760
WILL TELL YOU THAT OUR FOREIGN 

447
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,661
INFLUENCE TASK FORCE WORKS WITH 

448
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,196
F.B.I. 

449
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,265
PERSONNEL IN ALL 56 F.B.I. 

450
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:46,632
FIELD OFFICES. 

451
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:50,769
AND EVEN AS WE SPEAK, WE'VE GOT 

452
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,738
OPEN INVESTIGATIONS WITH A 

453
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,539
FOREIGN INFLUENCE NEXUS 

454
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,841
SPANNING FIELD OFFICES, F.B.I. 

455
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:56,642
FIELD OFFICES ACROSS THE 

456
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:56,909
COUNTRY. 

457
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,245
SO MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE SCOPE 

458
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,948
OF THIS FOREIGN INFLUENCE 

459
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,949
THREAT IS BOTH BROAD AND DEEP. 

460
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,685
SECOND PILLAR, I SAID THERE 

461
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,152
WERE THREE PILLARS. 

462
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,188
THE SECOND IS FOCUSED ON 

463
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:09,755
INFORMATION SHARING AND 

464
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:10,222
INTELLIGENCE SHARING. 

465
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,490
WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR 

466
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,691
PARTNERS IN THE INTELLIGENCE 

467
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,592
COMMUNITY AND IN THE FEDERAL 

468
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,762
GOVERNMENT, AS WELL AS WITH OUR 

469
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,064
STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS TO 

470
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,566
ESTABLISH A COMMON OPERATING 

471
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:20,833
PICTURE. 

472
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,802
JUST LAST WEEK AS AN EXAMPLE WE 

473
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,738
DISSEMINATED A LIST TO OUR 

474
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,639
STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 

475
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,206
PARTNERS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN 

476
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:29,141
INFLUENCE INDICATORS FOR THEM 

477
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:33,445
TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR, 

478
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,047
THINGS LIKE MALICIOUS CYBER 

479
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:35,814
ACTIVITY, SOCIAL ABNORMALITIES 

480
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,249
AND FOREIGN PROPAGANDA 

481
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:37,549
ACTIVITIES. 

482
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:39,785
THE IDEA IS TO MARSHAL 

483
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,254
ADDITIONAL EYES AND EARS IN THE 

484
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:42,554
FIGHT. 

485
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:44,456
WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH OUR 

486
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,524
INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS TO 

487
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,659
EXCHANGE INTELLIGECE AND 

488
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,525
STRATEGIES FOR COMBATING THE 

489
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,795
THREAT BECAUSE THIS IS AFTER 

490
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,564
ALL A SHARED THREAT WITH OUR 

491
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:52,797
ALLIES. 

492
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:53,999
THE THIRD PILLAR OF OUR 

493
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,769
APPROACH IS BASED ON OUR STRONG 

494
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,438
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PRIVATE 

495
00:13:59,438 --> 00:13:59,671
SECTOR. 

496
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:00,839
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE A 

497
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,543
FRONT LINE RESPONSIBILITY TO 

498
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,811
SECURE THEIR OWN NETWORKS, 

499
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,513
PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS, BUT 

500
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,015
WE'RE DOING OUR PART BY 

501
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:10,482
PROVIDING ACTIONABLE 

502
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,784
INTELLIGENCE TO BETTER ENABLE 

503
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,186
THEM TO ADDRESS ABUSE OF THEIR 

504
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,521
PLATFORMS BY FOREIGN ACTORS. 

505
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,357
SO THIS YEAR WE'VE MET WITH TOP 

506
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,159
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES AND 

507
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,061
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SEVERAL 

508
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:22,294
TIMES. 

509
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,862
WE'VE GIVEN THEM CLASSIFIED 

510
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,965
BRIEFINGS, WE'VE SHARED 

511
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,366
SPECIFIC THREAT INDICATORS AND 

512
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:27,933
ACCOUNT INFORMATION, AND A 

513
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,268
VARIETY OF OTHER PIECES OF 

514
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,337
INFORMATION SO THEY CAN BETTER 

515
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,070
MONITOR THEIR OWN PLATFORMS. 

516
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,040
THE REALITY IS IT'S GOING TO 

517
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,842
TAKE ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER 

518
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:40,646
TO HOLD THE FIELD BECAUSE THIS 

519
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:41,646
THREAT IS NOT GOING AWAY. 

520
00:14:41,646 --> 00:14:43,615
AS I HAVE SAID CONSISTENTLY, 

521
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:44,550
RUSSIA ATTEMPTED TO INTERFERE 

522
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,087
WITH THE LAST ELECTION AND 

523
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,354
CONTINUES TO ENGAGE IN MALIGNED 

524
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:50,189
INFLUENCE OPERATIONS TO THIS 

525
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:50,489
DAY. 

526
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,859
THIS IS A THREAT WE NEED TO 

527
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,894
TAKE EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY AND TO 

528
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:59,465
TACKLE AND RESPOND TO WITH 

529
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,032
FIERCE DETERMINATION AND A

00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,166
AND TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNERS, 

532
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,369

533
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,370
OTHER PARTNERS WE'VE TALKED 

534
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,040
ABOUT, I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE 

535
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,642
CAN PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF 

536
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:16,715
OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND 

537

DURING OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS.

00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:52,651
THIS IS A VITAL MISSION FOR US 

561
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,418
AND THE NATION. 

562
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:55,888
IT DRAWS ON OUR DEEP EXPERIENCE 

563
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,424
AND EXPERTISE IN CONTINUING 

564
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:58,857
WORK IN THIS AREA. 

565
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,794
OUR SUPPORT HAS BEEN ONGOING 

566
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,862
AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE 

567
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:04,295
MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 

568
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:05,364
WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING 

569
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,365

ADVERSARIES WHO ARE ATTEMPTING 

573
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,440
TO SOW DISCORD AND DIVISION 

574
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,741
WITHIN THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. 

575
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,943
THIS INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH 

576
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,547
APPROPRIATE ENTITIES TO ALERT 

577
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,547
THEM OF MALICIOUS CYBER ACTORS. 

578
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:23,849
U.S. CYBER COMMAND AND THE 

579
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,085
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY ARE

00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,487
TRACKING A WIDE RANGE OF

00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,990
ARE PREPARED TO CONDUCT 

583
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,928
OPERATIONS AGAINST THOSE ACTORS 

584
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,496
ATTEMPTING TO UNDERMINE OUR 

585
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,163
NATION'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 

586
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,200
THESE TYPE OF OPERATIONS ARE 

587
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,301
SENSITIVE AND REQUIRE 

588
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,868
CONFIDENTIALITY FOR SUCCESS. 

589
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:45,437
I WON'T DISCUSS THE SPECIFICS 

590
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:50,542
EXCEPT TO STATE THAT OUR FORCES 

591
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,244

592
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,912
VERY CAPABLE:  I HAVE COMPLETE 

593
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,148
CONFIDENCE IN THE FORCES UNDER 

594
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:56,448

00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,649
WE WILL WORK IN CONJUNCTION 

596
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,084
WITH OTHER ELEMENTS OF OUR 

597
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,686
GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE WE BRING 

598
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,688
THE FULL POWER OF OUR NATION TO 

599
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,556
BEAR ON ANY FOREIGN POWER THAT 

600
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,991
ATTEMPTS TO INTERFERE IN OUR 

601
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:06,458
DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES. 

602
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:11,762
I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE 

603
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:12,064
MODERATOR. 

604
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:12,497
>> THANK YOU. 

605
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:14,398
AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING, IT 

606
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:15,968
WE COULD STAY ON TOPIC AND ALSO 

607
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,970
IF YOU COULD WHEN ASKING A 

608
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,271
QUESTION DIRECT IT TO A 

609
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:19,938
SPECIFIC PERSON, AND AS ALWAYS, 

610
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,673
AFTER WE FINISH THIS PART OF 

611
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,742
THE BRIEFING, I'LL BE BACK TO 

612
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,078

613
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:26,444
OF THE DAY. 

614
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:26,978
JOHN, GO AHEAD. 

615
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:28,347
>>REPORTER:  DIRECTOR COATS, IF 

616
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,548
I COULD DIRECT A QUESTION TO 

617
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:29,848
YOU. 

618
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:30,115
>> SURE. 

619
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,284
>>REPORTER:  LET ME TAKE YOU 

620
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:36,188
BACK, IF I COULD, TO HELSINKI, 

621
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,289
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO 

622
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,991
INDICATE THAT HE MAY BELIEVE 

623
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,493
VLADIMIR PUTIN WHEN HE SAYS HE 

624
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,296
DIDN'T HAVE ANY INFLUENCE IN 

625
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,464
THE 2016 ELECTION. 

626
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:48,600
WHAT IS YOUR BELIEF ABOUT THE 

627
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,502
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT 

628
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,169
IN MEDDLING IN 2016. 

629
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:54,740
AND IF AS YOU SAY RUSSIA 

630
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,074
CONTINUES TO TRY TO INFLUENCE 

631
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:56,808
OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS, DOES 

632
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:58,777
THAT MEAN THAT NOTHING MUCH 

633
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,180
CAME OF THE MEETING WITH PUTIN, 

634
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,882
OR IS IT OTHER GOVERNMENT 

635
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:04,415
ACTORS WHO ARE INVOLVED? 

636
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,584
>> WELL, IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE 

637
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,486
2016 ELECTION, OF COURSE NONE 

638
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,489
OF US WERE IN OFFICE AT THAT 

639
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,690
PARTICULAR TIME, BUT BOTH THE 

640
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,658
PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT, 

641
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,994
I THINK EVERYONE ON THIS STAGE 

642
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,496
HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT THAT 

643
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:17,929
THE I.C.A. 

644
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,500
WAS A CORRECT ASSESSMENT OF 

645
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,100
WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016. 

646
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,869
WE HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY MADE THE 

647
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,537
DETERMINATION TO MAKE THIS A 

648
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,474
TOP PRIORITY, THAT IT DOESN'T 

649
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,074
HAPPEN AGAIN, AND WE'RE 

650
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:29,674
THROWING EVERYTHING AT IT. 

651
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:37,549
AND WE WILL HAVE AND WILL BE 

652
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,817
DISCUSSING THAT HERE TODAY. 

653
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,485
RELATIVE TO MY DISCUSSIONS WITH 

654
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:44,089
THE PRESIDENT ON WHATEVER ISSUE 

655
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,391
IT IS, THOSE -- I DO NOT GO 

656
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:46,791
PUBLIC WITH THAT. 

657
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:52,598
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE PROPER 

658
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,064
THING TO DO. 

659
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:55,400
SO OUR FOCUS HERE TODAY IS TO 

660
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,835
SIMPLY TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

661
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,304
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE THREAT, IT 

662
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,739
IS REAL, IT IS CONTINUING, AND 

663
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,774
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN 

664
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,844
TO HAVE A LEGITIMATE ELECTION 

665
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,245
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN 

666
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,147
HAVE TRUST IN. 

667
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,381
IN ADDITION TO THAT, IT GOES 

668
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,983
BEYOND THE ELECTIONS, IT GOES 

669
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,884
TO RUSSIA'S INTENT TO UNDERMINE 

670
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:14,486
OUR DEMOCRATIC VALUES, DRIVE A 

671
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,688
WEDGE BETWEEN OUR ALLIES AND DO 

672
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,625
A NUMBER OF OTHER NEFARIOUS 

673
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,826
THINGS, AND WE ARE LOOKING AT 

674
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,193
THAT ALSO. 

675
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,594
BUT TODAY WE ARE HERE TO TALK 

676
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,997
ABOUT THE ELECTIONS COMING UP 

677
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,666
AND WHAT WE'RE DOING, ASSURING 

678
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,400
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

679
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,034
>>REPORTER:  LET ME CLARIFY. 

680
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,202
BOTH YOU AND DIRECTOR WRAY SAID 

681
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,571
THAT RUSSIA CONTINUES TO TRY TO 

682
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,772
MEDDLE IN OUR ELECTIONS. 

683
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,239
>> THEY DO. 

684
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:37,142
>>REPORTER:  AND INFLUENCE 

685
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:37,375
VOTERS. 

686
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,144
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ROGUE 

687
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:39,611
RUSSIAN INDIVIDUALS? 

688
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:43,014
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE 

689
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:43,281
KREMLIN? 

690
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:45,550
>> I'M THINKING YOU CAN -- BOTH 

691
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,050
AND EVEN ADD TO THAT. 

692
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,219
RUSSIA HAS USED NUMEROUS WAYS 

693
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,689
IN WHICH THEY WANT TO INFLUENCE 

694
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,990
THROUGH MEDIA, SOCIAL MEDIA, 

695
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,392
THROUGH BOTS, THROUGH ACTORS 

696
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,893
THAT THEY HIRE, THROUGH 

697
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,195
PROXIES, ALL OF THE ABOVE AND 

698
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:57,562
POTENTIAL MORE. 

699
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:58,997
-- AND POTENTIALLY MORE. 

700
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,466
I CAN'T GO INTO DEEP, DEEP 

701
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:01,966
DETAILS BECAUSE IT IS 

702
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:02,300
CLASSIFIED. 

703
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,002
IT IS PERVASIVE, IT IS ONGOING 

704
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,070
WITH THE INTENT TO ACHIEVE 

705
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,275
THEIR INTENT AND THAT IS DRIVE 

706
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,677
A WEDGE AND UNDERMINE OUR 

707
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,110
DEMOCRATIC VALUES. 

708
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,247
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU.

THANK YOU. 

711
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,384
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT 

712
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,520
MUELLER HAS INDICTED MORE THAN 

713
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,188
20 RUSSIAN OFFICIALS BASED ON 

714
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,956
WORK BY THE F.B.I. 

715
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:28,427
FOR MEDDLING IN THE 2016 

716
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:28,727

THE PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED THAT 

718
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:30,696
THAT INVESTIGATION BY THE 

719
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,331
SPECIAL COUNSEL IS A HOAX AND 

720
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,131
THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE SHUT 

721
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:33,598
DOWN. 

722
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:35,400
I KNOW YOU SAID YOU DON'T 

723
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,201
BELIEVE IT IS A HOAX. 

724
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,669
BUT WHY WOULD THE AMERICAN 

725
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,236
PEOPLE BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE 

726
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:42,274
SAYING ABOUT THE F.B.I. 

727
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:42,874
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT 

728

THE INVESTIGATION BY THE 

729
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,810
SPECIAL COUNSEL IS A HOAX AND 

730
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,677
WHEN THE PRESS SECRETARY 

731
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,412
YESTERDAY SAID THAT THERE WAS A 

732
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,480
LOT OF CORRUPTION WITHIN THE 

733
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,448
F.B.I., DO YOU HAVE ANY 

734
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,682
RESPONSE TO THOSE THINGS COMING 

735
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,516
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE? 

736
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,884
>> WELL, I CAN ASSURE THE

743
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:05,062
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, SARAH. 

744
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:08,867
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR DIRECTOR 

745
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:09,100
COATS. 

746
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,701
DIRECTOR COATS, HOW WOULD YOU 

747
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,403
CHARACTERIZE THE CURRENT 

748
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,973
RUSSIAN EFFORTS TO MEDDLE IN 

749
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,675
THE 2018 ELECTION RELATIVE TO 

750
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:17,075
2016? 

751
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,843
IS IT MORE INTENSE? 

752
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:20,579
DO YOU SEE THOSE EFFORTS 

753
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,212
FOCUSED ON A PARTICULAR PARTY, 

754
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:27,819
AND IN GENERAL, IS THE PACE OF 

755
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:34,226
RELATIVE TO 2014, 2012, OR IS 

756
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:34,692
IT MORE ATTEMPTS? 

757
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:36,395
>> RELATIVE TO WHAT WE HAVE 

758
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,996
SEEN FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, 

759
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:41,500
IT IS NOT THE KIND OF ROBUST 

760
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,301
CAMPAIGN THAT WE ASSESSED IN 

761
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:43,668
2016 ELECTION. 

762
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,270
WE KNOW THAT THROUGH DECADES 

763
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,841
RUSSIA HAS TRIED TO USE ITS 

764
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,076
PROPAGANDA AND METHODS TO SOW 

765
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:51,642
DISCORD IN AMERICA. 

766
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,078
HOWEVER, THEY STEPPED UP THEIR 

767
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,780
GAME BIG TIME IN 2016. 

768
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,918
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT KIND OF 

769
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,120
ROBUST EFFORT FROM THEM SO FAR. 

770
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,723
AS I MENTIONED PUBLICLY JUST A 

771
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,825
FEW WEEKS AGO, WE ARE ONLY ONE 

772
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,725
KEYBOARD CLICK AWAY FROM 

773
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,461
FINDING OUT SOMETHING THAT WE 

774
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,962
DON'T -- HAVEN'T SEEN UP TO 

775
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:11,596
THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. 

776
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:14,299
BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NOT SEEN 

777
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,000
THAT. 

778
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,501
>>REPORTER:  TO FOLLOW UP, SIR, 

779
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:22,674
DO YOU SEE IT DIRECTED TO ANY 

780
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,074
PARTICULAR PARTY? 

781
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:24,576
THIS CURRENT 2018 EFFORT, IS 

782
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,179
THERE ANY PARTY CURRENTLY 

783
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:27,712
BENEFITING FROM ANY 2018 

784
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:28,079
RUSSIAN EFFORT? 

785
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,981
>> WHAT WE SEE IS THE RUSSIANS 

786
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,316
ARE LOOKING FOR ANY OPPORTUNITY 

787
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,717
REGARDLESS OF PARTY, REGARDLESS 

788
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:35,120
OF WHETHER OR NOT IS APPLIES TO 

789
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,989
THE ELECTION TO CONTINUE THEIR 

790
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,658
PERVASIVE EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE 

791
00:22:40,658 --> 00:22:47,032
OUR FUNDAMENTAL VALUES. 

792
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,133
>>REPORTER:  ALSO FOR DIRECTOR 

793
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:48,366
COATS. 

794
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,001
PERHAPS AMBASSADOR BOLTON CAN 

795
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,403
WEIGH IN ON THIS AS WELL. 

796
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,873
ON THE RUNOFF IT -- RUNUP TO 

797
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,476
THE HELSINKI SUMMIT, THE NATO 

798
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:02,781
AMBASSADORS TO RUSSIA SAID THAT 

799
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:03,982
THE PRESIDENT WOULD RAISE THE 

800
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:04,715
MGNED PRESIDENT WITH PUTIN. 

801
00:23:04,715 --> 00:23:06,618
YOU'RE SAYING TODAY THAT THE 

802
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,720
PRESIDENT HAS DIRECTED YOU TO 

803
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,889
MAKE THE ISSUE OF ELECTION 

804
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,356
MEDDLING A PRIORITY. 

805
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,724
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE 

806
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,626
DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT YOU ARE 

807
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,695
SAYING, HIS ADVISERS AND WHAT 

808
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:17,662
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID ABOUT 

809
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:17,995
THIS ISSUE? 

810
00:23:17,995 --> 00:23:21,500
>> I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO 

811
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,502
EITHER UNDERSTAND FULLY OR TALK 

812
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,035
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN 

813
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:24,302
HELSINKI. 

814
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:29,941
I'LL THROW IT OVER TO THE 

815
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,042
NATIONAL SECURITY DIRECTOR 

816
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:31,476
HERE. 

817
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,979
>> THE ISSUE WAS DISCUSSED, 

818
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:34,980
AND, IN FACT, PRESIDENT PUTIN 

819
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,283
SAID I THOUGHT AT THE PRESS 

820
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,885
CONFERENCE BUT CERTAINLY IN THE 

821
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:40,852
EXPANDED BILATERAL MEETING WHEN 

822
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,021
THE TWO LEADERS GOT TOGETHER 

823
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,288
WITH THEIR SENIOR ADVISERS 

824
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:45,991
PRESIDENT PUTIN SAID THE FIRST 

825
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,760
ISSUE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

826
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,395
RAISED WAS ELECTION MEDDLING. 

827
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,664
>>REPORTER:  I GUESS THE 

828
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:53,698
QUESTION IS AT THE PRESS 

829
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,568
CONFERENCE THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T 

830
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,536
HIGHLIGHT ANY OF THE MALIGNED 

831
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,871
ACTIVITIES THAT YOU HAVE AND 

832
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:00,772
THAT HIS ADVISERS HAVE. 

833
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,974
AND SO SHOULD AMERICANS BELIEVE 

834
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,376
THAT HE IS LISTENING TO YOUR 

835
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,678
ADVICE OR THAT HE IS GOING HIS 

836
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:07,378
OWN WAY WHEN HE'S HAVING 

837
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:08,813
MEETINGS LIKE HE DID WITH THE 

838
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:09,781
PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA? 

839
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,083
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS 

840
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,585
MADE IT IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR TO 

841
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,719
EVERYBODY WHO HAS A 

842
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,319
RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS AREA 

843
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,821
THAT HE CARES DEEPLY ABOUT IT 

844
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:18,723
AND THAT HE EXPECTS THEM TO DO 

845
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:25,196
THEIR JOBS TO THEIR FULLEST 

846
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:25,796
ABILITY AND THAT HE SUPPORTS 

847
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:26,130
THEM FULLY. 

848
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,634
>> SARAH, I BELIEVE THIS IS FOR 

849
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,001
DIRECTOR COATS. 

850
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,503
SINCE SOCIAL MEDIA WAS BROUGHT 

851
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,972
UP, THERE WAS A RECENT CASE 

852
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,608
WITH FACEBOOK HAVING RECENTLY 

853
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,176
SHUT DOWN 32 ACCOUNTS BELIEVED 

854
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,077
POTENTIALLY TO BE FROM RUSSIA. 

855
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,947
CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA, IS 

856
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:42,881
THAT A LARGE AMOUNT, IS THAT A 

857
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:46,618
-- IS THAT JUST KIND OF THE TIP 

858
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,251
OF THE ICEBERG? 

859
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:48,753
AND THEN GENERALLY SPEAKING 

860
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,422
WITH THESE SOCIAL MEDIA 

861
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,289
COMPANIES, FACEBOOK, TWITTER, 

862
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,624
INSTAGRAM, HOW MUCH HAVE THEY 

863
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,792
PROGRESSED OR HAVE THEY NOT 

864
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,094
PROGRESSED IN WHAT YOU WOULD 

865
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,097
LIKE TO SEE IN TERMS OF 

866
00:24:59,097 --> 00:24:59,797
PROGRESSION FROM 2016 IN 

867
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:00,765
IDENTIFYING THE THREAT? 

868
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:04,603
>> FIRST I'M NOT GOING TO 

869
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,770
DISCUSS ANY SPECIFIC ONGOING 

870
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,137
INVESTIGATION. 

871
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,906
BUT WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS 

872
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,574
THAT ACTIVITY OF THE SORT 

873
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,876
YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS A GOOD 

874
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:13,345
REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT WE 

875
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,846
HAVE TO HAVE A PUBLIC/PRIVATE 

876
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,580
PARTNERSHIP IN THIS PARTICULAR 

877
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,283
THREAT, AND THAT'S WHY WHEN I 

878
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:18,950
TALKED ABOUT OUR THREE PILLARS 

879
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,817
OF THE F.B.I.'S FOREIGN 

880
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:20,752
INFLUENCE TASK FORCE, WE'RE 

881
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,420
SPENDING SO MUCH OF OUR EFFORT 

882
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,788
TRYING TO ENGAGE WITH THE 

883
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:24,622
SOCIAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGY 

884
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:26,091
COMPANIES BECAUSE THERE IS A 

885
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,728
VERY IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THEM TO 

886
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,029
PLAY IN TERMS OF MONITORING AND 

887
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,397
IN EFFECT POLICING THEIR OWN 

888
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:32,697
PLATFORMS. 

889
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,932
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE HAPPEN 

890
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,734
WHICH STARTED HAPPENING IN A 

891
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,703
WAY WHICH IS MUCH MORE ROBUST, 

892
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,472
MUCH MORE ROBUST THAN IN BEFORE 

893
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,706
THE 2016 ELECTION, WE'RE 

894
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,608
SHARING WITH THEM ACTIONABLE 

895
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,477
INTELLIGENCE IN A WAY THAT 

896
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,077
WASN'T HAPPENING BEFORE. 

897
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:46,878
WE UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT THEY 

898
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,512
NEED, THEY'RE SHARING 

899
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:48,680
INFORMATION BACK WITH US BASED 

900
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,581
ON WHAT THEY FIND. 

901
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,483
THERE ARE THINGS THAT THEY CAN 

902
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,284
DO ON THEIR PLATFORMS 

903
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,818
VOLUNTARILY IN TERMS OF TERMS 

904
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:54,819
OF USE AND THINGS LIKE THAT 

905
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,221
THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T 

906
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,122
HAVE A ROLE IN. 

907
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,723
BUT IN TURN WE LEARN THINGS 

908
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,792
FROM THEM, AND WE CAN USE THAT 

909
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,159
TO HAVE OUR INVESTIGATIONS BE 

910
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:02,560
MORE EFFECTIVE. 

911
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,896
SO I DO THINK PROGRESS IS BEING 

912
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:05,129
MADE. 

913
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:06,498
WE GOTTA KEEP GETTING BETTER AT 

914
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,398
IT, WE GOTTA KEEP STAYING ON 

915
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:09,734
THE BALLS OF OUR FEET, BUT I 

916
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,637
THINK THAT IS WHAT WE ARE 

917
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:12,871
SEEING. 

918
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:13,772
>>REPORTER:  AMBASSADOR BOLTON, 

919
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,140
YOU TALK ABOUT ORDERING THE 

920
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,575
CLOSURE OF THE CONSULATES IN 

921
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,978
SAN FRANCISCO AND SEATTLE, 

922
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:20,612
THESE ARE TWO TECH HUBS, WHAT 

923
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,514
HAPPENED THERE THAT LED YOU TO 

924
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:22,780
DO THAT? 

925
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,315
>> WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO 

926
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:25,817
DISCUSS THE BACKGROUND OF THAT 

927
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,719
DECISION WHICH ACTUALLY 

928
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:33,525
OCCURRED BEFORE I CAME TO THIS 

929
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,626
JOB, BUT THE PURPOSE OF 

930
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,226
EXPELLING THE RUSSIAN 

931
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,661
INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE EXPELLED 

932
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,831
WAS TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO 

933
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:40,732
RUSSIA THAT THEIR CONDUCT IN 

934
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,534
CONDUCTING A CHEMICAL WEAPONS 

935
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,336
ATTACK IN GREAT BRITAIN WAS 

936
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,503
UNACCEPTABLE, AND THIS WAS A 

937
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,105
MODE OF RETALIATION DESIGNED TO 

938
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,307
SHOW THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE 

939
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,809
THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY ON THE 

940
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,210
TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES 

941
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,578
OR ANY OF OUR ALLIES, AND WE 

942
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:54,879
EXPELLED A LOT OF THE PEOPLE 

943
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,681
WHO WE THINK HAD KNOWLEDGE OF 

944
00:26:56,681 --> 00:27:00,785
IT OR HAD OTHER ACTIVITIES IN 

945
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,722
THE UNITED STATES THAT WE 

946
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:04,255
CONSIDERED UNACCEPTABLE. 

947
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,324
>>REPORTER:  THIS I GUESS WOULD 

948
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:09,527
BE MAYBE FOR SECRETARY NIELSEN 

949
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:10,028
OR FOR MR. WRAY. 

950
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,730
THESE MEDDLING CAMPAIGNS SEEM 

951
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,666
TO FALL INTO TWO BROAD 

952
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,234
CATEGORIES, THIS SORT OF 

953
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:16,801
INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS WHICH 

954
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,536
CHALLENGE THE INFORMATION UPON 

955
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,805
WHICH AMERICANS USE TO MAKE 

956
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,975
THEIR DETERMINATIONS, AND THEN 

957
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,610
THE MORE PHYSICAL INTERFERENCES 

958
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,312
INTO THE MACHINERY OF VOTING, 

959
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,415
TABULATION OF VOTING, THE VOTER 

960
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,582
ROLLS, THE MACHINERY THAT THE 

961
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:32,317
STATES RUN. 

962
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,451
CAN YOU GUYS DESCRIBE WHAT 

963
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,353
YOU'RE SEEING SPECIFICALLY IN 

964
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,288
THE RUNUP TO THIS COMING 

965
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,157
ELECTION IN BOTH OF THOSE 

966
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:39,390
AREAS? 

967
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,926
DO YOU WORRY MORE ABOUT ONE 

968
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:42,460
THAN THE OTHER? 

969
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,529
ARE THERE SPECIFIC THREATS THAT 

970
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,030
MAYBE YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT 

971
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,533
BUT THAT YOU CAN SAY THERE HAVE 

972
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,534
BEEN SPECIFIC THREATS IN BOTH 

973
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,603
OF THOSE CATEGORIES SO THAT -- 

974
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,337
AND HOW SHOULD AMERICANS 

975
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,772
PROCESS THAT WHERE WE'RE GOING 

976
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,808
TO GO TO THE POLLS IN A FEW 

977
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:57,041
MONTHS? 

978
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:59,611
SHOULD PEOPLE BE CONFIDENT THAT 

979
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,311
WHEN THEY PULL THE LEVER 

980
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:00,778
THEY'RE SECURE? 

981
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:04,382
>> WELL, I THINK WE'VE SAID 

982
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,984
THIS FAIRLY CONSISTENTLY THAT 

983
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,653
IN THE CONTEXT OF 2018 WE ARE 

984
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,956
NOT YET SEEING THE SAME KIND OF 

985
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,058
EFFORTS TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET 

986
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:15,059
ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE, YOU 

987
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,761
KNOW, VOTER REGISTRATION 

988
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,130
DATABASES IN PARTICULAR. 

989
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,533
WHAT WE ARE SEEING ARE THE 

990
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,534
MALIGNED INFLUENCE OPERATIONS, 

991
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,235
IN EFFECT INFORMATION WARFARE 

992
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,703
THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT, AND 

993
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,906
THAT'S A 24/7, 365 DAYS A YEAR 

994
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,073
PHENOMENON THAT DOESN'T TURN 

995
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:30,408
NECESSARILY ON WHETHER OR NOT 

996
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,111
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN 

997
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,512
ELECTION SEASON OR NOT. 

998
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,180
BUT AS DIRECTOR COATS SAID, ANY 

999
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,516
MOMENT IS JUST A MOMENT BEFORE, 

1000
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,418
YOU KNOW, THE DIAL CAN BE 

1001
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,353
TURNED UP ONE, MUCH AS WE SAW 

1002
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:42,653
IN 2016. 

1003
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:44,422
AGAIN, NOT IN TERMS OF 

1004
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,658
EFFECTING THE VOTE COUNT, BUT 

1005
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,259
IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL 

1006
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,327
PENETRATION OF VOTER 

1007
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:49,927
REGISTRATION DATABASES OR 

1008
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:50,428
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 

1009
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:53,998
AND THAT IN TURN CAN BE A 

1010
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,834
VEHICLE FOR THEM TO TRY TO SOW 

1011
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:56,968
DISCORD OR UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE 

1012
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,036
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE 

1013
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,472
PUSHING BACK ON IT WHICH IS 

1014
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:02,039
WHAT WE'RE DOING. 

1015
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:02,773
>>REPORTER:  JUST TO -- 

1016
00:29:02,773 --> 00:29:04,609
>> JUST TO ADD, SO THE WAY 

1017
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,511
WE'RE SPLITTING IT, WE ARE ALL 

1018
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,512
PARTNERING TOGETHER, BUT YOUR 

1019
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,315
QUESTION DISHES A LITTLE BIT OF 

1020
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,249
THE DIVISION OF LABOR. 

1021
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:13,718
SO JUST FOCUSED ON THE ELECTION 

1022
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:14,352
INFRASTRUCTURE, IN TERMS OF 

1023
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,254
STATE AND LOCALS THAT HAVE THE 

1024
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,555
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY AND THEN 

1025
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,556
WE ACCOUNT FOR THE F.B.I.'S 

1026
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,457
EFFORT IN COUNTERING THE 

1027
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:19,757
INFLUENCE. 

1028
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:20,558
WITH REGARD TO THE 

1029
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,526
INFRASTRUCTURE PIECE, WE HAVE 

1030
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,128
SEEN A WILLINGNESS AND A 

1031
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,462
CAPABILITY ON THE PART OF THE 

1032
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,064
RUSSIANS, AND SO WE ARE WORKING 

1033
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,133
VERY CLOSELY WITH STATE AND 

1034
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,234
LOCALS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE 

1035
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:29,934
PREPARED THIS TIME AROUND. 

1036
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,670
PART OF THAT IS ENCOURAGING 

1037
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,270
STATES TO HAVE AUDITTABILITY, 

1038
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,506
SO TO GET TO THAT ONE PART OF 

1039
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:36,006
YOUR QUESTION, WHATEVER 

1040
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:37,208
HAPPENS, WE WANT TO ASSURE 

1041
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:37,909
AMERICANS THE DAY AFTER THAT 

1042
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,678
THEIR VOTE WAS COUNTED AND IT 

1043
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:41,145
WAS COUNTED ORRECTLY. 

1044
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:42,413
SO REGARDLESS OF WHAT MIGHT 

1045
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,280
HAPPEN, WE WILL BE PREPARED. 

1046
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:49,454
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE 

1047
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,555
WE HAVE THAT AUDIT ABILITY. 

1048
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,923
>>REPORTER:  SECRETARY NIELSEN, 

1049
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,858
WILL A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN ON

OCTOBER 1st AFFECT ANY OF THESE 

1051
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:56,761
EFFORTS? 

1052
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:00,365
>> SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS IN

00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:00,965
2017D.H.S. 

1054
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,334

INFRASTRUCTURE SUBSECTOR. 

1057
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:05,703
SO WE PRIORITIZE EFFORTS, SO 

1058
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,472

WITHIN OUR BUDGET. 

1064
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:17,815
SO THANK YOU.

>> WE'LL TAKE ONE LAST 

1066
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,117
QUESTION.

GENERAL. 

1069

CAN YOU UNPACK A LITTLE BIT 

1070
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:22,753
MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID? 

1071
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:24,088
YOU SAID -- THE QUESTION FOR 

1072

THE DIRECTOR AND THE QUESTION 

1073
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,424
FOR THE GENERAL ARE SEPARATE. 

1074
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:29,794
CAN YOU GIVE US A BETTER SENSE 

1075
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:30,528
OF WHO SPECIFICALLY HAS BEEN 

1076
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:30,862
TARGETED? 

1077
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,864
WE KNOW THESE TWO SENATORS HAVE 

1078
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,466
SAID THAT THEY'VE BEEN TARGETED 

1079
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,868
BY HACKING OR BY PEOPLE 

1080
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:37,401

IS IT MEMBERS OF THE SENATE, 

1083
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:43,708
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE, IS IT 

1084
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,409
DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN 

1085
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:44,709
CAMPAIGNS? 

1086
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,311
AND THEN A SEPARATE QUESTION 

1087
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:46,977
FOR THE GENERAL. 

1088
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:48,046
>> WE FOLLOW A PROCEDURE THAT'S 

1089
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,716
BEEN AGREED ON SOME TIME AGO IN 

1090
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:55,253
TERMS OF WHEN WE RECEIVE THIS 

1091
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,156
TYPE OF INFORMATION IT IS 

1092
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,824
PROCESSED THROUGH THE

TARGETED. 

1098
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,234
SO WE HAVE TAKEN THAT ACTION 

1099
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:12,337
THAT IS IN PLACE, BUT I'M NOT 

1100
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:16,040
IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW TO 

1101
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,540

00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:22,746
INTERFERED? 

1107
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:23,781
>> WELL, WE ALREADY HAVE THOSE 

1108
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,516
-- A LOT OF SANCTIONS IN PLACE, 

1109
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:29,053
AND I WOULD SUPPORT ANY EFFORTS 

1110
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,354
THAT WE CAN COLLECTIVELY PUT 

1111
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:31,956
TOGETHER TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO 

1112
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,058
RUSSIA THAT THERE IS A COST, A 

1113
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:34,892
PRICE TO PAY FOR WHAT THEY'RE 

1114
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:37,562
DOING, AND IF WE WANT TO HAVE 

1115
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,996
ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP 

1116
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:40,264
WHATSOEVER IN DEALING WITH 

1117
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:41,366
THINGS OF MUTUAL INTEREST, THE 

1118
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,434
RUSSIANS HAVE TO STOP DOING 

1119
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,569
WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR IT'S 

1120
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,472
SIMPLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. 

1121
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:49,841
>>REPORTER:  GENERAL, HAVE YOU 

1122
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,076

1129
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,084
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT 

1130
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,453
MEDDLING IN THE ELECTIONS AND 

1131
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:02,953

>> WE'LL TAKE A COUPLE MORE 

1138
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,303
QUESTIONS ON OTHER TOPICS 

1139
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:19,536

1140
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:19,903
JOE, GO AHEAD. 

1141
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:20,270
>> THANK YOU. 

1142
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,439
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE 

1143
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,239
PRESIDENT'S TWEET ON NORTH 

1144
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:22,540
KOREA. 

1145
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,607
HE WAS ADDRESSING KIM JONG-UN, 

1146
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:25,510
AND HE SAID, QUOTE, I LOOK 

1147
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,514
FORWARD TO SEEING YOU SOON. 

1148
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,549
ARE THERE PLANS IN PLACE RIGHT 

1149
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:32,817
NOW, ANYTHING ABOUT A SECOND 

1150
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,485
MEETING AND ALSO HE SAID HE 

1151
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,319
RECEIVED A LETTER FROM KIM. 

1152
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,821
WHAT DID THE LETTER SAY, AND 

1153
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,856
DID IT ADDRESS ANY OF THE 

1154
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:42,960
REPORTS THAT APPEAR TO SHOW 

1155
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,827
THAT KIM IS NOT ACTUALLY 

1156
00:32:43,827 --> 00:32:44,362
WORKING TOWARDS TO 

1157
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:44,762
DENUCLEARIZATION? 

1158
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,964
>> THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

1159
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:47,765
ROLLED INTO ONE. 

1160
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:48,967
I'LL TRY TO ADDRESS EACH ONE. 

1161
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,368
IF I MISS SOMETHING, I'M SURE 

1162
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,469
YOU GUYS WILL POINT IT OUT. 

1163
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,737
I DID RECEIVE A LETTER. 

1164
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,939
I BELIEVE HE RECEIVED IT ON 

1165
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:55,239
AUGUST 1st. 

1166
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,942
THERE IS NOT A SECOND MEETING 

1167
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,343
THAT IS CURRENTLY LOCKED IN OR 

1168
00:32:59,343 --> 00:33:01,846
FINALIZED, CERTAINLY OPEN TO 

1169
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,848
THAT DISCUSSION, BUT THERE 

1170
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:04,514
ISN'T A MEETING PLANNED. 

1171
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:06,117
WE HAVE RESPONDED TO CHAIRMAN 

1172
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,553

1174
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:10,187
DELIVERED SHORTLY. 

1175
00:33:10,187 --> 00:33:12,757
BEYOND THAT, I CAN'T GET INTO 

1176
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:13,624
ANY FURTHER DETAILS. 

1177
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,660
>>REPORTER:  HAS HE ADDRESSED 

1178
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,460
THE CONCERNS -- 

1179
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,164
>> I CAN SAY THAT THE LETTERS 

1180
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,165

1181
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,600
THEIR JOINT STATEMENT THAT WAS 

1182
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,368
MADE AT THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT 

1183
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:26,537
AND THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE 

1184
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,705
WORKING TOGETHER TOWARDS 

1185
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:28,306
COMPLETE AND TOTAL 

1186
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:28,706
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

1187
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:29,640
AGAIN, I CAN'T GO ANY FURTHER 

1188
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,042
THAN WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU. 

1189
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,610
>>REPORTER:  IVANKA TRUMP MADE 

1190

ODDS IN THE POSITION OF HER 

1192
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:36,180
FATHER. 

1193
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,949
SHE SAID THE MEDIA ARE NOT THE 

1194
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,184
ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE AND ALSO 

1195
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,052
CALLED THE SEPARATION AT THE 

1196
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:41,585
BORDER THE LOW POINT. 

1197
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:43,054
WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT THINK 

1198
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:43,320
OF THAT? 

1199
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,921
>>REPORTER:  THE PRESIDENT 

1200
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,056
HIMSELF HAS STATED THAT HE 

1201
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,456
DOESN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF FAMILY 

1202
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:46,757
SEPARATION. 

1203
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:47,925
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DOES. 

1204
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,360
WE ALSO DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF 

1205
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,761
OPEN BORDERS, WE DON'T LIKE THE 

1206
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:51,963
IDEA OF ALLOWING PEOPLE INTO 

1207
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,464
OUR COUNTRY IF WE DON'T KNOW 

1208
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:54,765
WHO THEY ARE, WHERE THEY'RE 

1209
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:55,799
GOING AND WHY THEY'RE COMING. 

1210
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:56,833
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO SECURE 

1211
00:33:56,833 --> 00:34:00,671
OR BORDERS WHICH IS WHY HE HAS 

1212
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,540
ASKED CONGRESS TO FIX THE LAW. 

1213
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,641
WE HAVEN'T BEEN UNCLEAR ABOUT 

1214
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,742
WHAT OUR POSITION IS HERE. 

1215
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,345
WE WANT TO SECURE THE BORDERS, 

1216
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,413
WE WANT TO CHANGE THE LAW. 

1217
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:11,215
IT'S CONGRESS' JOB TO DO THAT. 

1218
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:11,949
WE'D LIKE THEM, PARTICULARLY 

1219
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:12,949
DEMOCRATS TO STOP PLAYING 

1220
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:17,922
POLITICAL GAMES AND STEP UP AND 

1221
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:18,289

00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,958
>>REPORTER:  INAUDIBLE  ] 

1223
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,460
>> THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHTFULLY 

1224
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:22,760
FRUSTRATED. 

1225
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,860
90% OF THE COVERAGE ON HIM IS 

1226
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,063
NEGATIVE DESPITE THE FACT THAT 

1227
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,264
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, ISIS IS 

1228
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:28,266
ON THE RUN AND AMERICAN 

1229
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:28,966
LEADERSHIP IS BEING REASSERTED 

1230
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:29,500
AROUND THE WORLD. 

1231
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,068
JUST THIS WEEK THE MEDIA 

1232
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:33,938
REFUSED TO COVER HIS REMARKS IN 

1233
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,139
FLORIDA, HIGHLIGHTING EFFORTS 

1234
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:35,706
ON WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT. 

1235
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:36,741
IN FACT, THE PULLER FOR THE 

1236
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,309
PRESS SAID THERE WAS NO NEWS 

1237
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,043
MADE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE 

1238
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:40,777
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE JOINED 

1239
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:41,846
WITH DOZENS OF BUSINESSES 

1240
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,648
ACROSS THE STATE OF FLORIDA TO 

1241
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,315
ANNOUNCE THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS. 

1242
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:47,051
THAT MAY NOT BE NEWS IN 

1243
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:47,985
WASHINGTON D.C., BUT I CAN 

1244
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,454
ASSURE YOU THAT IT'S NEWS IN 

1245
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,353
THE STATE OF FLORIDA THAT 

1246
00:34:50,353 --> 00:34:52,657
PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE A JOB 

1247
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:53,391
BEFORE THIS PRESIDENT TOOK 

1248
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,359
OFFICE HAVE BETTER OPPORTUNITY 

1249
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,994
AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A 

1250
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:57,694
JOB MOVING FORWARD, THAT'S 

1251
00:34:57,694 --> 00:34:58,863
ACTUALLY REAL NEWS AND 

1252
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,865
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE IN THE 

1253
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,067
STATE OF FLORIDA AND ACROSS 

1254

THIS COUNTRY APPRECIATE. 

1255
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:05,435
AND THAT WAS TOTALLY IGNORED. 

1256
00:35:05,435 --> 00:35:07,038
NOT ONLY THAT, BEFORE A 

1257
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,806
JOURNALIST ON CNN CLAIMED THAT 

1258
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:09,640
THE PRESIDENT HADN'T TAKEN 

1259
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,108
QUESTIONS IN OVER A WEEK 

1260
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:13,244
DESPITE THE FACT THAT SAME 

1261
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,345
JOURNALIST DID A LIVE SHOT FROM 

1262
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,746
THE TWO AND TWO PRESS 

1263
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:16,913
CONFERENCE THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1264
00:35:16,913 --> 00:35:18,449

ITALY JUST MOMENTS AFTER MAKING 

1266
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,385
THAT ACCUSATION. 

1267
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,887
WITH THIS SORT OF 

1268
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,355
MISINFORMATION AND LACK OF 

1269
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,589
INTEREST THAT'S SO PERVASIVE IN 

1270
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:29,660
THE MEDIA, IT'S COMPLETELY 

1271
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,461
UNDERSTANDABLE FOR THE 

1272
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,061
PRESIDENT TO BE FRUSTRATED. 

1273
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:32,196

IS THERE A TIME LINE AS TO WHEN 

1281
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,643
OR IF THE PRESIDENT MAY PULL 

1282
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,446

FOLLOW U ON SARAH'S QUESTION 

1467
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:10,808
FROM NPR. 

1468
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:11,909
SHE ASKED YOU ABOUT IVANKA 

1469
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,611
TRUMP'S STATEMENT THAT THE 

1470
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,514
PRESS IS NOT THE ENEMY OF THE 

1471
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:17,448
PEOPLE, AND SHE ASKED YOU 

1472
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,550
WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESS IS THE 

1473
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,117
ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. 

1474
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,986
YOU READ OFF A LAUNDRY LIST OF 

1475
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,087
YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRESS, 

1476
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,789
AND THEN THINGS THAT YOU FEEL 

1477
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:26,590
LIKE ARE MISREPORTED. 

1478
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,759
BUT YOU DID NOT SAY THAT THE 

1479
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,394
PRESS IS NOT THE ENEMY OF THE 

1480
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:30,627
PEOPLE. 

1481
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:32,596
I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD 

1482
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,498
THING IF YOU WERE TO SAY RIGHT 

1483
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:35,900
HERE AT THIS BRIEFING THAT THE 

1484
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,401

ASKING QUESTIONS OF OFFICIALS 

1488
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,074
LIKE THE ONES YOU BROUGHT 

1489
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,243
FORWARD EARLIER ARE NOT THE 

1490
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:50,114

1492
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:52,249
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS 

1493
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:52,649
POSITION KNOWN. 

1494
00:40:52,649 --> 00:40:53,850

00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,582
ATTACKS WITHOUT ANY CONTENT 

1515
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:25,916
OTHER THAN TO INCITE ANGER. 

1516
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,885
THE MEDIA HAS ATTACKED ME 

1517
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,286

00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:56,760
IMPORTANCE OF MIDTERM ELECTIONS 

1644
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,762
AND SECURING AND MAKING SURE 

1645
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:03,834
THEY ARE IN FACT SAFE AND HACK. 

1646
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,869
EACH OF THEM WENT TO GREAT 

1647
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,037
LENGTHS TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE 

1648
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,238
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND 

1649
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:09,305
WHAT THE TILL AGAINST AGENCIES 

1650
00:45:09,305 --> 00:45:10,073
ARE DOING. 

1651
00:45:10,073 --> 00:45:12,609
THEY ALSO SAID THERE IS A 

1652
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:16,513
CONTINUED -- THE WORDS OF DNI 

1653
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,148
DIRECTOR DAN COATS, IT'S 

1654
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,416
ONGOING, AND IT'S CONTINUING. 

1655
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,584
THAT THERE IS A CONTINUED 

1656
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:20,817
THREAT. 

1657
00:45:20,817 --> 00:45:23,287
THEY DID GO ONTO SAY IT WASN'T 

1658
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:28,258
AS BAD AS IT WAS IN 2016 BUT IT 

1659
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:28,658
IS HAPPENING. 

1660
00:45:28,658 --> 00:45:30,160
THEY WANTED TO SEND A MESSAGE 

1661
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,396
THAT THEY ARE ALL WORKING ON 

1662
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,965
THIS IN A COORDINATED EFFORT TO 

1663
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,466
TRY TO GET THE RESOURCES ON A 

1664
00:45:36,466 --> 00:45:38,035
NATIONAL AND STATE LEVEL TO 

1665
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:38,869
MAKE SURE THE ELECTIONS COME 

1666
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,637
NOVEMBER WILL BE IN FACT 

1667
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:44,141
SECURED AND THERE WON'T BE 

1668
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:44,474
INTERFERENCE. 

1669
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:45,943
I WANT TO BRING IN ED AT THE 

1670
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:46,276
WHITE HOUSE. 

1671
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:47,044
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING 

1672
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,678
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE BROUGHT 

1673
00:45:48,678 --> 00:45:50,647
OUT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 

1674
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:51,548
TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS. 

1675
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:54,184
HOW DO THEY GO WITH THE FACT 

1676
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:57,287
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS CALLING 

1677
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,790
FOR THE RUSSIA PROBE TO END 

1678
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:00,457
WHEN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 

1679
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:02,358
IS SAYING IT'S STILL ONGOING? 

1680
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:08,298
>>  WE TRIED ASKING THAT AND 

1681
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,100
DIDN'T GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER. 

1682
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,802
IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE THEM 

1683
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:16,473
HERE IN THE BRIEFING ROOM 

1684
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,609
DESCRIBING THE SERIOUSNESS AND 

1685
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,476
WHAT IS HAPPENING REGARDING 

1686
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:25,682
RUSSIAN ATTEMPTS TO CLUB THE 

1687
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,017
RUSSIAN ELECTION AND YET THEIR 

1688
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,218
BOSS FEELS DIFFERENTLY AND IS 

1689
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:31,421
NOT WILLING TO GO AS FAR AS 

1690
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,722
THEY HAVE, ESPECIALLY DIRECTLY 

1691
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:34,624
TO THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT. 

1692
00:46:34,624 --> 00:46:36,126
>>  I WANT TO PLAY SOUND FOR 

1693
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,829
YOU FROM THE DIRECTOR OF 

1694
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:39,329
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. 

1695
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,932
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT RUSSIAN 

1696
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:42,832
INTERFERENCE IN UNITED STATES 

1697
00:46:42,832 --> 00:46:43,634
ELECTIONS. 

1698
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,702
>>  THE PRESIDENT HAS 

1699
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:47,905
SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED US TO 

1700
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:51,875
MAKE THE MATTER OF THE ELECTION 

1701
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:52,709
MEDDLING AND SECURING OUR 

1702
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:54,077
ELECTION PROCESS A TOP PRIORITY 

1703
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:55,979
AND WE HAVE DONE THAT AND ARE 

1704
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,082
DOING THAT AND WILL CONTINUE TO 

1705
00:46:59,082 --> 00:46:59,315
DO SO. 

1706
00:46:59,315 --> 00:47:00,751
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 

1707
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,586
CONTINUES TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT 

1708
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,754
THE THREATS OF UPCOMING UNITED 

1709
00:47:04,754 --> 00:47:08,425
STATES ELECTIONS, BOTH THE 

1710
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,660
MIDTERMS AND THE PRESIDENTIAL 

1711
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,627
ELECTION IN 2020. 

1712
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,362
IN REGARDS TO RUSSIAN 

1713
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:15,299
INVOLVEMENT IN THE MIDTERM 

1714
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:22,639
ELECTIONS, WE CONTINUE TO SEE A 

1715
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,408
CAMPAIGN TO TRY TO WEAKEN AND 

1716
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:25,075
DIVIDE THE UNITED STATES. 

1717
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:28,612
>>  THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE 

1718
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:29,212
COMMUNITY IS CONCERNED. 

1719
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:30,113
IS THE PRESIDENT CONCERNED? 

1720
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,649
>>  REMEMBER WE HAVE SEEN HIM 

1721
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,584
TALK ABOUT THIS NOT AS 

1722
00:47:34,584 --> 00:47:35,251
FORCEFULLY AND DIRECTLY AS 

1723
00:47:35,251 --> 00:47:36,954
COATS DID THERE AND SO WE WILL 

1724
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,822
SEE IF HE HAS ANYTHING TO SAY 

1725
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:42,359
ABOUT THIS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS 

1726
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:42,626
OR HOURS. 

1727
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,061
CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, SENDING 

1728
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,162
THEM OUT HERE IS A SIGNAL THAT 

1729
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,263
THE ADMINISTRATION SEPARATE 

1730
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:47,297
FROM THE PRESIDENT IS TAKING 

1731
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,598
THIS SERIOUSLY AND CONTINUES TO 

1732
00:47:48,598 --> 00:47:49,332
WORK ON IT. 

1733
00:47:49,332 --> 00:47:51,068
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS. 

1734
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,069
THEY DIDN'T SAY THEY WERE 

1735
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:55,138
COMING TO DO IT BUT THEY HAVE. 

1736
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,673
THEY OUTLINED SPECIFICALLY -- 

1737
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:57,941
NOT NECESSARILY SPECIFICALLY 

1738
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,710
BUT THEY OUTLINED WHAT IT IS 

1739
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,077
THEY ARE DOING. 

1740
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,878
I THINK ONE OF THE MORE NOTABLE 

1741
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:04,615
ASPECTS OF THIS, YOU HAD THE 

1742
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:07,384
GENERAL HEAD OF CYBER COMMAND 

1743
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,785
SAY, PRETTY CLEARLY THAT THEY 

1744
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:11,955
HAVE BEEN TOLD IF NEED BE THEY 

1745
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:13,323
CAN TAKE ACTIONS AGAINST ACTORS 

1746
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:15,959
WHO MAY BE DOING THIS I ASKED 

1747
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:19,262
THEM HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD TO TAKE 

1748
00:48:19,262 --> 00:48:20,464
OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS AGAINST 

1749
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,566
ANYONE AND HE DIDN'T ANSWER IT 

1750
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,834
DIRECTLY BUT CERTAINLY SIGNALED 

1751
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,502
THERE THAT PERHAPS THEY HAD 

1752
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:25,802
DONE THAT. 

1753
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:27,237
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE IF 

1754
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:27,604
WE LEARN MORE. 

1755
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,740
>>  DO WE KNOW IF THE TACTICS 

1756
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,241
ARE THE SAME THAT THEY USED IN 

1757
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,143
2016 THAT THE ONES THAT THESE 

1758
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,344
CYBER ATTACKS ARE EMPLOYING AT 

1759
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:34,878
THIS CURRENT MOMENT? 

1760
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,513
>>  THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. 

1761
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,448
IT WAS ASKED AND YOU HEARD THE 

1762
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:40,651
DIRECTOR SAY IT HASN'T BEEN TO 

1763
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:44,988
THE SAME LEVEL AS WAS SEEN IN 

1764
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:45,188
2016. 

1765
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:46,222
HE HINTED IT'S ONLY AUGUST. 

1766
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:47,791
WE HAVE A FEW MORE MONTHS TO GO 

1767
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,826
LEAVING THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT 

1768
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,763
MAY BE AT SOME POINT. 

1769
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,398
IT HAS NOT BEEN AS INTENSE SO 

1770
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:56,166
FAR AS IT WAS BACK IN 2016. 

1771
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:57,167
AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE 

1772
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:57,434
DIRECTOR. 

1773
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,303
>>  I ALSO WANT TO SWITCH GEARS 

1774
00:48:59,303 --> 00:48:59,670
AND ASK YOU. 

1775
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,439
THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON A 

1776
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,174
POTENTIAL INTERVIEW WITH THE 

1777
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,008
PRESIDENT AND THE RUSSIAN TEAM. 

1778
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:08,478
DID WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT? 

1779
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:09,146
>>  WE DID NOT. 

1780
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:12,649
WE HAVE SEEN THE BACK AND FORTH 

1781
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,986
ON IF IT'LL HAPPEN. 

1782
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:16,653
THE PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY HAS 

1783
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:17,587
SUGGESTED THAT IT WON'T BUT 

1784
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,290
THERE WAS NO NEW GROUND ON THAT 

1785
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:20,823
SO FAR TODAY. 

1786
00:49:20,823 --> 00:49:22,893
THEY HAD MADE PRETTY CLEAR IT 

1787
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:23,793
WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT ELECTION 

1788
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:26,296
INTERFERENCE AND NOT TO GET IN 

1789
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:26,930
TO THE OTHER ISSUES. 

1790
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:30,200
YOU KNOW AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL 

1791
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,167
THE -- THE DEBATE CONTINUES 

1792
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:33,170
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE 

1793
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,437
PRESIDENT WILL DO IT. 

1794
00:49:34,437 --> 00:49:36,807
WE KNOW THAT HE HAS EXPRESSED A 

1795
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,475
DESIRE TO DO IT BUT THERE'S NO 

1796
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,610
WORD ON WHEN IT MAY HAPPEN IF 

1797
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,178
AT ALL. 

1798
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,246
>>  WE KNOW THE PRESS SECRETARY 

1799
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,448
WAS ASKED ABOUT A POSSIBLE 

1800
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:47,784
SECOND MEETING WITH NORTH 

1801
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:48,017
KOREA. 

1802
00:49:48,017 --> 00:49:48,651
>>  SAID THERE'S NOTHING 

1803
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:50,520
SCHEDULED AND THAT THEY ARE 

1804
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,321
OPEN TO IT. 

1805
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:51,954
THE PRESIDENT DID CONFIRM THIS 

1806
00:49:51,954 --> 00:49:53,689
MORNING IN A TWEET THAT HE HAD 

1807
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:55,892
RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE 

1808
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:59,096
NORTH KOREA CHAIRMAN SORT OF

00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:01,598
FOLLOWING UP ON THEIR MEETING 

1810
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:01,931
IN SINGAPORE. 

1811
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:03,499
THAT WAS THE PRESIDENT WAS 

1812
00:50:03,499 --> 00:50:06,203
THANKING CHAIRMAN KIM FOR 

1813
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:08,705
RETURNING WHAT THEY SAY ARE 

1814
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:09,773
REMAINS OF AMERICANS FROM THE 

1815
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,575
KOREAN WAR THAT WERE RECEIVED 

1816
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:12,108
OVERNIGHT IN HAWAII. 

1817
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:13,877
THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS THERE 

1818
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,613
FOR THAT AND THERE WAS A 

1819
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:22,818
MILITARY CEREMONY THERE IN 

1820
00:50:22,818 --> 00:50:23,085
HAWAII.. 

1821
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:26,423
THERE WAS A LETTER BUT THEY 

1822
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:27,524
DIDN'T GET INTO SPECIFICS AND 

1823
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,060
MADE CLEAR THERE ARE NO PLANS 

1824
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,528
FOR A SECOND MEETING. 

1825
00:50:32,528 --> 00:50:35,532
>>  AND YOU ASKED ABOUT BRETT 

1826
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:35,832
KAVANAUGH. 

1827
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:37,300
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIS 

1828
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,536
NOMINATION AND DO WE THINK THAT 

1829
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,939
HE WILL BE CONFIRMED BEFORE 

1830
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:43,206
NOVEMBER? 

1831
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,740
>>  BEFORE NOVEMBER. 

1832
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,374
THAT'S THE KEY QUESTION NOW. 

1833
00:50:45,374 --> 00:50:47,744
THAT IS CERTAINLY THE GOAL OF 

1834
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:48,678
THE WHITE HOUSE AND REPUBLICANS 

1835
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,380
IN THE SENATE WHO WANT TO SEE 

1836
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,582
HIM SEATED BY THE FIRST MONDAY 

1837
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:53,583
IN OCTOBER WHEN THE COURT 

1838
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:54,618
CONVENES FOR THEIR NEXT 

1839
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,520
SESSION. 

1840
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,421
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY IS THE 

1841
00:50:58,421 --> 00:50:59,423
NATIONAL ARCHIVES LET IT BE 

1842
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,324
KNOWN THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE 

1843
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:04,528
A DELAY IN PROVIDING ALL OF THE 

1844
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:05,228
DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN 

1845
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,430
REQUESTED REGARDING KAVANAUGH'S 

1846
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,597
PREVIOUS WORK IN THE BUSH ERA 

1847
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,332
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, HERE AT THE 

1848
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:10,099
WHITE HOUSE AS STAFF SECRETARY 

1849
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:13,503
AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS THEY 

1850
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:13,903
HAVE REQUESTED. 

1851
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:16,306
THEY SAID THEY ARE LOOKING AT 

1852
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,608
CLOSE TO 900,000 DOCUMENTS 

1853
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:20,477
WHICH IS A MASSIVE NUMBER 

1854
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,480
COMPARED TO CHIEF JUSTICE 

1855
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,115
ROBERTS WHEN HE WAS CONSIDERED, 

1856
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:26,783
THEY ONLY GAVE OVER 70,000 

1857
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:27,083
DOCUMENTS. 

1858
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:29,853
WHAT THEY SIGNALED IS WE DON'T 

1859
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,555
NECESSARILY HAVE THE ABILITY TO 

1860
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:34,457
DO THIS UNTIL OCTOBER WHICH 

1861
00:51:34,457 --> 00:51:40,330
WOULD EXCEED THE EXPECTATIONS, 

1862
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,431
THE HOPES OF THE JUDGE'S 

1863
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:41,731
SUPPORTERS. 

1864
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:42,632
THE CURRENT THINKING IS A 

1865
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:43,967
HEARING WOULD BE HELD IN 

1866
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,602
SEPTEMBER AND A VOTE AFTER 

1867
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:45,835
THAT. 

1868
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:48,205
ALL INDICATIONS ARE AT THIS 

1869
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,807
POINT THAT HE HAS ENOUGH 

1870
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:51,407
SUPPORT AMONG REPUBLICANS AND 

1871
00:51:51,407 --> 00:51:54,444
NO DEMOCRAT HAS SIGNALED THEY 

1872
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,414
WILL VOTE FOR HIM. 

1873
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:58,782
>>  ALL RIGHT. 

1874
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,550
>>> AS WE MENTIONED THE 

1875
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,351
PRESIDENT HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN 

1876
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:02,552
PUSHING HIS LEGAL TEAM TO 

1877
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,655
COMMIT TO AN INTERVIEW WITH THE 

1878
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:06,055
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 

1879
00:52:06,055 --> 00:52:06,957
HIS ATTORNEYS HAVE BEEN 

1880
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,725
NEGOTIATING THE TERMS FOR AN 

1881
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:09,492
INTERVIEW FOR MONTHS INCLUDING 

1882
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:15,532
WHICH TOPICS CAN BE COVERED AND 

1883
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,032
THE FORMAT. 

1884
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:16,666
HIS LAWYERS HAVE BEEN CAREFUL 

1885
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,134
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS INDICATED 

1886
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:20,604
HE WANTS TO DO IT. 

1887
00:52:20,604 --> 00:00:00,000
I HAVE ALWAYS
