FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF.

64
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,252
IF YOU ADD THE HEAD OF PUBLIC

00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:58,196
WHEN WE GET THAT TAPE ON CAMERA

73
00:01:58,196 --> 00:02:01,133
WE'LL PLAY IT BACK FOR OUR

74
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:01,466

FIRST THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

REPORT ON THE BUREAU RIGHT NOW

77
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:06,872
AND EXPECTED TO TESTIFY NEXT

78
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:08,039
WEEK ON THE HILL.

79
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,608
IS THAT STILL HAPPENING?

80
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:11,243

DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL

83
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:18,083
TASKED TO LOOK AT THE CLINTON

84
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,585
EMAIL INVESTIGATION IT WAS VERY

85
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:21,186
BIPARTISAN.

86
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:21,887
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.

87
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:23,522
THE EXPECTATION IS THAT REPORT

88
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:24,356
WOULD PROBABLY BE READY EARLIER

89
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:26,792
THIS YEAR BUT ALL OF THE

90
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:28,427
DEADLINES OR TIMELINES HAVE

91
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:28,927
SEEMED TO SHIFT.

92
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:30,762
THE BEST DAY WE HAVE ON THE

93
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:33,165
CALENDAR IS FOR NEXT WEEK WHEN

94
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:33,866
HOROWITZ IS SCHEDULED TO

95
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:36,235
TESTIFY BEFORE ONE OF THE HOUSE

96
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:36,635
COMMITTEES.

97
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:37,870
BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

98
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,272
THAT COULD ALSO SHIFT IN TERMS

99
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:42,374
OF THE TIMELINE BECAUSE HE HAS

100
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:43,542
CONTINUED TO RECEIVE NEW LEADS

101
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,811
HE HAS PURSUED ON THE HANDLING

102
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,045
OF THE F.B.I.'S INVESTIGATION

103
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:49,181
INTO THE CLINTON EMAILS AND

104
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:49,915
ALSO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S
