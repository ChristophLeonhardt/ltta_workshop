ladies and gentlemen boys and girls cats and dogs I sit before you today absolutely shocked to learn that President Donald Trump stands accused of paying off women to keep them silent about his adulterous affairs the sleaziness of this behavior is out of everything I know as president because after all normally when I look up at a building and see the gigantic gold letters spelling Trump on top of it I think that's class but let's put this in some perspective in the last election we had a choice between a candidate who paid off women to keep them silent about adulterous affairs and Donald Trump and I thought to myself do I want to elect a woman who has promised to gut the Second Amendment and seriously damage the first or do I want to elect a man who's being blackmailed by some seriously banging chicks and will leave my first and second Amendment rights alone because he has no idea what they are and I admit faced with those options I look back sadly on America's better days when John F Kennedy boldly promised we would go to the moon and then bang two women simultaneously in the White House pool that's right simultaneously he also got along with Marilyn Monroe America was just a greater nation then now many Democrats and journalists but I repeat myself are accusing Republicans of hypocrisy they say if Hillary Clinton had done what Trump did we would be calling for her head and hey there's nothing I like better than a lecture on sexual ethics from a party that just nominated a guy in a skirt and pearls to run for governor of Vermont but they have a point I would be calling for Hillary said if only to stop her from laughing that horrible laugh that sounds like a pterodactyl and eat so I say bring on the Democrats journalists late-night comedians and never Trump errs to continually insult ordinary Americans for their beliefs their ways of life and their political choices and then to try to impeach the president they elected on a campaign finance technicality do it Democrats because I think you'll all look absolutely marvelous in tar and feathers trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show there's a we need also sing see top see

8 of 18 counts the other 10 counselor was a mistrial and Michael Cohen the even bigger story made a deal with the prosecutors that implicated trumpet I know what you're thinking you're thinking about Hegelian aesthetic theory that's what I was thinking about I know where else but this Joe can you go from koan to Kigali anaesthetic theory and I am may be the only person in America who is read Hegel in the original gibberish but here this is true Hegel's aesthetic Theory had a great theory about what tragedy is he had this theory that infinite principles universal principles worked themselves out in history so these principles were on the spiritual level but they worked themselves out in history by two sides coming together and kind of destroying each other and becoming a third thing and each time it did this it rose the history rose toward the spiritual absolute but was always doing it in half measures because these two sides both of these two sides were partly right and partly wrong this is what Karl Marx stole and he took the spiritual element out of it and turned it into a nonsense so it could be believed by people like Alexandria and Google eyes Cortez but anyway Hegel said the tragedy occurred in moments of transition when a hero was forced to choose between one of two options both of which were right and both of which were wrong so no matter what he did he was choosing the right but he was also doing wrong and the dialectic was was resolved by the death of the hero and that's how it moved on to the next stage and that's how tragedy happened and that is where we found ourselves in the 2016 election see it actually does really sense actually doesn't that is where we found ourselves we found ourselves between two choices on the one side we had the party that promised to fundamentally transform the greatest nation on earth into something else like thanks a lot these people are socialists people have have told us that our our most basic concepts of reality meant what men and women are what gender is what who we are what freedom means all of this they told us for 20 30 40 years completely wrong and now finally after eight years of weakening the country of weakening our standing in the world of weakening our economy when I wanted to take off they were going to get their next you know politician in there Hillary Clinton to nail down those fundamental transformations by appointing the kind of Supreme Court justices would rewrite our constitution from the bench to do all the things that they have been trying to yeah these many years and they thought they had it and we had to choose between them and Donald Trump who is not a very nice individual and that we had to go take a choice between whether we're gonna protect our country protect our Constitution protect the simple truth of reality what reality is and not feel that every time we said X instead of Y we were a racist or a terrible person when we said Oh golly gee those those nice Muslim people keep blowing people up all around the world we wouldn't be accused of racism when we said oh there are problems in the black community that have to do with their culture that aren't the fault of the past we wouldn't be called racism when we said we wanted men to be men and women to be women we wouldn't be told we were crazy all of that all of that stuff we were defending by voting for a guy and we knew we knew exactly who he was and I think that that we made those of us who voted for him I think that was the right choice but it was a tragic choice and by a tragic choice I don't mean that people died when you made it I mean that each saw each side had a very tragic price the price of getting Hillary elected of course was the country the price of voting for Donald Trump is we are now defending a guy who does stuff that is not all that defensible however however the one thing we have going for us the one thing we have going for us is the Left keeps overreacting that what Donald Trump is accused of and I'll get into the details in a minute but Donald Trump is accused of is essentially a can't so far is a campaign finance violation the money that pat that changed hands when he was buying off according to Michael Kohn and let's face it it sounds to me like he's telling the truth according to Michael Kohn the money he was using to pay off the women that Trump was sleeping with was less than the money Obama was fined for his over two million dollars in illegal campaign contributions so normally normally these things are dealt with with a fine we also have the this kind of deep state vendetta going after Trump and everyone who's ever come near him Paul Manafort would never have gotten caught caught up in this he's been doing this stuff for years the only reason he got caught up is because he came within Trump circle and this silly Russian investigation is going on Michael Kohn probably the same thing although guys like Cohn do tend to up in jail anyway let's take a listen to robert Kazami who is the prosecutor the federal prosecutor in new york he's the one who announced that cone and this is the bigger case because cone essentially implicated Trump in these payoffs here's the part where he's talking about those charges that involve Trump what he did was he worked to pay money to silence two women who had information that he believed would be detrimental to the 2016 campaign and to the candidate and the campaign in addition mr. Cohen sought reimbursement for that money by submitting info invoices to the candidates company which were untrue and false they indicated that the reimbursement was for services rendered for the year 2017 when in fact those invoices were a sham he provided no legal services for the year 2017 and it was simply a means to obtain reimbursement for the unlawful campaign contribution a couple of points I'd like to make first these are very serious charges and reflect a pattern of Lies and dishonesty over an extended period of time so that's a big thing because it reflects a pattern of lies and dishonesty over an extended period of time and he's your witness against Donald Trump doesn't make that great a witness but nonetheless the whole point here is that what they're saying what they said what I've heard them saying on the news which is just untrue is that this is a campaign finance violation because he did it to keep the women quiet so he could get elected but that's not the case the the thing is that contributions to candidates even if they're in kind contributions not just money are limited to I think it's $2,700 so this was more than that money now if it comes from Trump his contributions to himself are not limited but it's only a limitation if Cohen was the one making it making it and it was disguised and they didn't say what it was and all this so again it's the kind of thing where you'd usually get a fine you get a slap on the wrist this is a vendetta these are this is Robert Mahler on a goose while goose chase after this Russians stuff I believe and he's on this wild goose chase but he does what prosecutors always do is they prosecute the guys who fall within their kin and he's going after them also of course this is a move in the chess game that that Muller is using to turn these guys so he's twisting the screws on Michael Cole Trump Trump tweaked it out I kind of love this Trump tweeted out if anyone is looking for a good lawyer I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Kohn it's too bad he couldn't send that tweet back into time to Donald Trump it's like oh yeah maybe I shouldn't hire this guy this is just like his bud for years as if his fixer but obviously this is to turn the screw on on Donald Trump and Lanny Davis who was Clinton's lawyer do right yeah there's Lanny Davis Clinton's lawyer he is now even though that in the plea when Michael Cohen pleaded guilty he did not name Trump Lanny Davis is bringing it against Trump and basically saying we're coming after you me and and Cohn let me make one hundred-percent clear the evidence was provided definitively by Donald Trump's lawyers they wrote the special counsel and said Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to make these illegal payments it's not a dispute it's not about credibility it's his lawyers in a letter use the word directed Rudy Giuliani said don't believe what Trump said on Air Force One it's not a crime to lie to the American people and he said Donald Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen so to be clear if Michael Cohen committed a federal crime at the direction of President Trump does that mean president Trump committed a federal crime president Trump committed a criminal act that corrupted our democracy that's what the campaign finance laws are about the same way that the Russians complicit with WikiLeaks and evidence that members of the campaign at least facilitated that conspiracy so that's that obviously is the narrative they want to sell that this is the same this is some connection to Russia it has no connection to Russia and the big language the big language he committed a crime that corrupted our electoral process he committed a campaign finance violation if that if they can prove that that's what it is let me tell you just one thing like if these guys think that they for 50 years they can insult they meet in the middle of this country the entire heartland of this country and tell people their culture stinks and tell people their religion stinks and tell people their flag is worth disrespecting and tell people America and go out and send out our president have to apologize for America and tell us who America needs to be fundamentally transformed and then after 50 years of this treatment people finally get angry enough that they're willing to break their own rules and elect Donald Trump if they think they're going to pull a coup on this president with campaign finance violations good luck I hope they try it because I think first they'll be tarred and feathered I really do and I think secondly you know people are going to turn out their big thing that they have in these upcoming midterm elections the big thing that they have is that Republicans I may not be smart enough to turn out the Democrats are supercharged they're angry as they can possibly be and they are going to show up but are the Republicans gonna show up because if they don't you know they're the Republicans are saying things like well I don't like this candidate here in my district cuz he's not like Trump but he's the guy who's gonna stop the impeachment hearings whoever he is whoever that Republican is you gotta vote for him because he's the guy who's gonna stop this from turning into nonsense the other thing with the GOP is Donald Trump is more popular among black people than just about anybody and for good reason he has improved the lives of Americans with dark skin more than any Democrat has ever done really he really has the economy is doing great for black Americans and and the only problem is is the Democrats have built a machine for turning out black votes they pay off preachers they pay off you know politicians and in bad neighborhoods to bring the people out and bust them out if the Republicans leave that card on the table if they leave those votes on the table they will suffer in the midterms but go on a little bit and talk about mana for mana for it is just a matter of timing part of the timing is forced on Muller it'll both happen on the same day Muller was convicted and part of the timing is forced on Muller by guidelines in the Justice Department not to prot do political prosecutions within 60 days of a major elections so that's kind of why these things came together but it also meant that the mana Ford thing could sound as if oh look all of trumps friends and pals are crooks which by the way there's a lot of truth to that but it still it makes it look like something is going on Trump came out and he's kind of morning about mana Ford you know this was this was not what happened was he got convicted on 8 of 18 counts I believe it was mostly on bank fraud and that sort of thing but there were 10 counts that are still on the table he can be retried for that he's scheduled to face trial in Washington DC on money laundering charges so he is under the gun - and he may turn on on Trump as well so there made me be more stuff down the line but I have to tell you there you know is there a place where I would go for impeachment of course I the only time in my entire life I ever thought a president should be impeached and this included Clinton the only time I ever thought a president should be impeach was when they found out about the IRS silencing voters during an election year I thought that was troduce in the you know that was crossing the lines of constitutional governance in such a way as it made our electoral system nonsense did far more than the damage than the Russians ever did - far more damage than anyone in my lifetime that was the only time I thought a president should be impeached so I'm not a big but is there something Trump could of course there is of course he could cross a line like that he could cross the line of constitutional governance in such a way that I thought he would be impeached but but again you know this is who Trump was we knew he was this guy when we voted for him we knew why we were voting for him I did I knew I was voting for him to stop the gutting of the Constitution by a corrupt politician at what's not like he was running against Abraham Lincoln he was running against mob Barker you know and the thing is all this parading about his morality all this parading and huffing and puffing about his morality think about this if Trump cent stepped down Mike Pence would become president the moment most moral men and government a man they can't put a piece of dust what do you think the Democrats are gonna say then are they gonna say oh good oh good now we have a man who doesn't you know cheat on his wife we're so happy now now we're fine they've been demonizing pence almost as badly as they have Trump it's the Constitution they hate it's the freedom they hate it's your right to say stuff so you know this is the other thing there the other news here which kind of got lost on all this political news of course was this this young girl this young student 20 year old student in Iowa Molly Tibbets who was murdered and she disappeared a while back as beautiful as it's possible to be as all-american looking as it's possible to be found in a cornfield and the guy who killed her it was charged with killing her is an illegal alien here's the DCI guy the Department of Criminal Investigation guy Rick Rick Ron is that his name let me make sure I've got his name right because he did the good job Rick Ron yeah announcing how they Family Guy we have confirmed with homeland security investigations that he is an illegal alien and we believe he's been in this area now for four to seven years or during the investigation we reached out to the public as you well know and during our neighborhood canvass we came across an individual that had security cameras we took those cameras he was kind enough to give us the footage from it and through that we were able to identify a vehicle that we believe belonged to mr. Rivera it was a black Malibu and from that we were able to track his pattern and the routes in which he took we're also able to find Molly running on this video and we were able to determine that he was one of the last ones to have seen Molly running based on the video again that we were able to seize from the general public so an illegal immigrant kills this girl and I just this is this is what I'm talking about when I'm talking about comparing Trump's character flaws which I fully acknowledge he has character flaws even things that make him corrupt even things that I that I find absolutely untenable and unacceptable okay now listen to Elizabeth Warren right one of the icons of the left listen to her react to this news about this girl being killed by an illegal alien while Congress sits on its hands both sides for years and years they have sat on their hands without fixing these laws without fixing our security they sit there and Chuck Shumer to his incredible shame one of the most shameful moments in this administration had nothing to do with Donald Trump it was Chuck Schumer shaking a pen at the press and begging Trump to act like a king and past the law when he is a master of the Senate who's supposed to be doing that compromising facing down his constituents and doing what needs to be done now listen to Elizabeth Warren reacting to the murder of this girl you know my I'm so sorry for the family here and I know this is hard not only for the family but for the people in her community the people throughout Iowa but one of the things we have to remember is we need an immigration system that is effective that focuses on where real problems are last month I went down to the border and I saw where children had been taken away from their mothers I met with those mothers who had been lied to who didn't know where their children were who hadn't had a chance to talk to their children and there was no plan for how they would be reunified with their children I think we need immigration laws that focus on people who pose a real threat and I don't think mamas and babies are the place that we should be spending our resources separating a mama from a baby does not make this country safer that is like a little computer flipping to Democrat talking points yes yes this girl is killed yes yes but what about the mamas and babies which has been going on long before Trump and which they're playing because it makes good TV and they think we're all locked in the same echo chamber they're locked in but we're not we're not and that is just a callous stupid political thing to say it is the words of a woman who is not thinking with with her human compassion but is simply thinking politically she has that speech in her head and she gets to it as quickly as she can and if you think that's bad listen to go over to MSNBC and listen to this Fordham Professor Christina Greer on the same subject the separation of powers is not working because the Republican Party has not stood up to this president not once so even if there is a guilty verdict from Manta for even though Cohen has turned himself in the fact that he was even sworn in its president after the Access Hollywood tape let me know for a fact that the Republican Party is actually not working on behalf of the American people they are working on behalf of Donald Trump and he's been able to bully them into their silence and I don't think that today changes much and fortunately I'm sure we'll hear what he has to say about this at his his rally the Fox News is talking about you know a girl in Iowa and not this right and tomorrow morning we know he'll wake up and tweet and sort of you know merch the reputation of Michael Cohen and all the people around him I really go back to Muller and this is obviously going to boil down to Hillary Clinton in Barack Obama a girl in Iowa so it's a combative wait is he talking about some girl in Iowa the White House AP reporters at the AP White House reporter Zeke Miller tweeted about the story of this guy getting arrested for the murder this is likely coming to a trump rally near you in other words it's just a talking point it's just a but it's not it's not on the talking point this is something that energizes the people let's listen to trump talking about it this cut five you earn about today with the illegal alien coming in very sadly from Mexico and you saw what happened to that incredible beautiful young woman should have never happened illegally in our country we've had a huge impact but the laws are so bad the immigration laws are such a disgrace we're getting them changed but we have to get more Republicans we have to get so I mean you choose you choose this Trump is a bet has a bad character Trump paid off you know cheated on his wife paid off the women he cheated with that's that's bad stuff that's doesn't become good because we get what we want politically but he is there is another side right he's up against another side we're choosing between a bunch of bats for choosing but being a government system that has gone terribly awry that needs reform that needs to be addressed that that it's filled with people like this but you know ultimately I'm not gonna throw this guy under the bus and with the cons and the Constitution with him over a campaign finance violation even if it does make my skin crawl and finally and most importantly I think I got to play this one last cut it's kind of long but it's worth listening to all week long we've been talking about the more than all week long I'm talking about a lot this Empire Strikes Back of the mainstream media trying to shut down the Democrat machine the Democrat corporations the corporate social media trying to shut down our voices we have fought so hard to break through with using you know social media using computers using the Internet to break through and get a little bit of a grip on the culture to start speaking to college students to start telling people that no it is not the way the left tells you there is another way to live it's a better way to live it is the way the founders wanted us to live and they're now they're trying to shut us down now all they talk about is Trump being a danger to free speech remember it's like 300 newspapers around the same editorial about how Trump was a danger to free speech while they were shutting down Alex Jones while they were taking Dennis Prager off Facebook while their shadow banning people on Twitter they're talking about Donald Trump is the big danger here is Donald Trump on fake news and free speech listen to what he's saying we are protecting again religious liberty and we're also standing up to social media censorship that's the new thing that's the new thing you know I'd rather have fake news like CNN I would rather have fake news strong then have anybody including liberals socialists anything then have anybody stopped and censor you gotta live we got to live with it we got to get used to it we're gonna live with a cruise there's too many sources every one of us is sort of like a newspaper you have Twitter you have whatever you have facebook but everyone you can't have censorship you can't pick one person and say well we don't like what he's been saying he's out so we'll live with fake news I mean I hate to say it but we have no choice because that's by far the better alternative we can't have people saying censorship because you know what it can turn around it could be them next it could be them next we believe in the right of Americans to speak their minds so Facebook is taking down Dennis Prager the New York Times on its front page is telling us that conservatives are weaponizing free speech one of their Supreme Court Judge justices Elena Kagan is saying this is weaponizing free speech and there's the president the United States defending free speech I will take that every time we know we made a tragic choice we knew we had to vote for a guy we didn't entirely approve of we knew he had to stand by him when he was being accused of things he probably did that make our skin crawl I would I did it then I would do it again today because he's defending the things that matter most our Constitution our country our freedom and they are actually against those things so listen young people especially don't like to hear that some choices are tragic young people especially think there's something there's an ideal that we can reach we're always trying to move toward that ideal but sometimes we have to do it in a tragic manner this is one of those times and I will stand with this guy as long as he's making speeches like that I will stand with them against for any number of prostitutes all right we got the mailbag coming up we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but come on over to the Daily wire.com subscribe then you can be in next week's mailbag and you won't have to carry around your troubles you can take your troubles out of your old kit bag put them in the mailbag we'll solve them all all right the mailbag from from leo hello Andrew the omnipotent bald leftist ears generator my parents got divorced when I was 2 years old I've recently gotten into small arguments with my two older sisters about how they should not have gotten the divorce after having three kids other than infidelity or criminality I said there's basically no excuse after kids to get a divorce I don't know too much about the details of their divorce but know that until very recently I'm now 23 so this is 21 years ago until very recently my parents hated each other with a burning passion should I ask them for more details also I want to forgive them for what I think was a selfish decision but how do I bring this up without putting them on the defensive well first of all I might might take away from this is that this bothers you this is haunting you and you should leave your sisters alone about it it's and that it's not for you to tell them what they should think about this it's not for you to impose you're upset on them you have to deal with this and you have to expunge this from your life so you can move forward because the divorce is over that part of your life your childhood is over it's now time for you to move forward into a adulthood I don't see anything wrong with sitting down with your parents and asking them you know about what happened then this divorce you know you don't want to pass judgment on them you don't want to yell at them you don't want to tell them you you know you think this and you think that but you might listen to them and hear what their experience was in general philosophically I agree with you I think once you have small kids you keep your marriage together you work it out you stop hating each other if you hate each other you stop you sit down with a therapist if you have to you stop I agree with you about this but now it's over now it's done you've got to move past it and build a life in which this doesn't happen that's your job so if it helps you to talk to them about it talk to them and listen you don't have to condemn them you don't have to yell at them but talk to them and listen and see if that helps you forgive them in your heart once you hear what they were going through it might help you to forgive them sometimes people do bad things but you can understand why they did them and you can move on but the purpose here is for you to move on that's the purpose that's your your chore your tour is not to convince your sisters of anything your chore is not to pass judgment on your parents your chores to let go so if that helps you to let it go do it if it doesn't don't do it it's that simple that the whole point is for you to go forward from Mike dear director Clavin Abraham I heard well I just finished listening to werewolf cop on audible and I enjoyed both the story and your narration very much how long did this take you to write and then record could you tell us about some of the most interesting steps in this timeline thanks from Mike you know there are a lot of questions today about writing so I'm gonna I'll sort of pile them on together werewolf come I don't know I think not a little thanks anywhere from a year to two years you know there's also a lot of like thinking about it you get the idea but then you got to let it generate you kind of dump it back in the water and let it come back up again with new things attached and and then there's an outline I am a very big outliner I hate it it's the only I don't hate it I dislike it it's the only part of my job that bores me I love writing I love what I do but writing an outline is boring grunt work because what you got to do is you got to make sure the plot is going to work and every time you're writing an outline and hear yourself say well I'll fix that in the writing you got to stop and say no I will fix that here because once your writing you want to be able to write you want to be able to create characters you want to be able to create moments you want to be asking yourself which of these two ways of phrasing a sentence is gonna create the effect that I want to create and so you want the outline to be there every day when you sit down and sometimes I'll abandon an outline Midway sometimes I'll fix it Midway but I want it to be there so at least I know what I'm doing each day and that's the first thing I do and then of course there's the research and research is really important because research gives things a very similar to I don't really care if my things are realistic obviously a story about a werewolf is not gonna be that realistic but I want it to be filled with kind of wait so that when you read it it feels like it's real and werewolf cop is a huge backstory that is based on a true story a true medieval trial in which I read the transcripts of the trial of a werewolf they you know a guy was charged with being a werewolf and that's it leads into some of the German mythology that runs through the story and the research is really important and finally the writing is my favorite part and I write everything I don't know 20 times I mean I read every word 20 times I go over and it over and over it doing that now with kingdom you know which we're doing for the podcast in the fall you know I just keep writing it keep writing until it sounds exactly the way I want it to sound and I am I think I can safely say that I'm known in the publishing industry for my clean manuscripts by that time they get to the editor there's very little for them to fix and finally recording takes about three days you know I mean you come in and it's it's hard work because you sit in a little studio in a box of a studio and for maybe seven eight hours and you just read and it's it's fun in the sense that when you take a break there are a lot of actors around and actors are always fun people to talk to so you get to sit around with actors but but it's just you know it's three days of hard work and and then you're done and then they produce it I think that answers everything and a lot of people asked how do you write such and such people who are budding writers but you know the outline thing is a big deal the outline thing is the thing that keeps you first of all it means your research is done you don't have to take off you don't suddenly get to a place and think I don't know how a cop would do this because you're already it was already in the outline you researched it and it's just preparation preparation makes everything else easier from Joshua Supremes son head clayvin I don't even know what that means on Episode five sixty you said you would likely get flack for saying the Jews are part of the body of Christ who doubt but are ultimately part of that body here is your flack I was waiting but you know I didn't hear from anybody this is the only thing I got but I don't always see the ones you maybe you saw some more of them yeah why wouldn't otherwise ohms or atheist be included in that category of doubters who are also part of the body of Christ Romans nine distinguishes the hereditary deaths of decedent's of Israel from the true Israel is there a special need for the Gentile atheist or Muslim worshipper to submit to the lordship of Christ but not the Jew based on their genetic heritage I have to tell a story before I answer this hilariously I went on audible I like to look sometimes at the reviews for the great good thing my memoir of my conversion to Christ is called the great good thing as a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ and it's inaudible and what I love about a lot of these reviews is people say oh this book help me find God and I find that very gratifying and moving and that is what the latest review actually says but beneath that is a huge review of a guy who says don't read this book he betrays us because 75% of the book is really great because it's about his conversion and then he's nice to the Jews he says there's a chapter in the book about where I think anti-semitism comes from the way this guy describes the chapter is totally false he says I blame Christianity for the Holocaust I had to do exactly the opposite of that but I just loved the fact that he says I don't blame I don't blame the Jews enough for their own part in the Holocaust which was dying that was their part in the Holocaust so I mean it's just just the absolute ravenous anti-semitism but I thought I just thought I'd share that with you because it did make me laugh a mordant laugh that's the work I want anyway first of all I put forward this theory impishly I understand you know you understand I'm not a theologian I but I do believe that and I believe the Catholic Church says this that there is a special dispensation for the Jews they are not the same as the Muslims they are the chosen people of God they were selected as the doorway back into God's doorway back into the world after the fall so they have a special relationship I do not believe that special relationship gets cancelled I don't believe in what it's called replacement theology that Jesus replaces the Jews with other people I think that that that relationship remains they were real your relationship with God remains what God says it is not what you say it is not what I say it is it remains what God says it is but again I very rarely speculate on the afterlife I don't know anything about it neither do you there's very little about it in the Bible it's and so all the speculation is just that it's speculation and why not assume that God's mercy is greater than our mercy God's love is greater than our love and it's going to look a lot better than some small-minded people think it is and I think the other thing about this is as CS Lewis said we know that you were only saved through Christ but we don't know who is saved through Christ or how that that affects people who are outside of the faith so that was my take on it I stand by it I think it's actually good theory but but if you want to pass judgment on the Jews go ahead it ain't gonna mean anything it's not gonna mean any more than my judgment from Joel to Clavin tell her of tremendous Truths over the years and especially through college I've tried extremely hard to be open-minded fully aware that I grew up sheltered and with very conservative beliefs both religious and political I've delved into any opposing viewpoints or worldviews that I encounter in search of arguments or evidence that might make you rethink my beliefs most people seem to agree the changing one's beliefs upon hearing better arguments as a sign of integrity and honesty I often hear it stated that if you can't point to a belief or viewpoint that has changed over the years you must be bigoted or closed-minded and I get frustrated when I hear that because despite all my efforts and research I can't think of one significant change that's taking place in my thinking since at least high school I don't know how old you are but that is kind of interesting I don't know if I'm reading the wrong material if somehow there is more subconscious stubbornness in me that I haven't found or I got lucky and already believed all the right things do you have any advice you know personally I wouldn't worry about it I mean I I have seen people get caught on a track everything every argument gets dismissed the least you can do and I do this all the time the least you can do is read good books that make other arguments if nothing else if nothing else it will hone your arguments for what you believe because people have other things to say they see the world differently I myself believe that you can make an absolute logical argument for Neil ISM for the absence of any God the absence of any morality I believe those are the two ways you can look at the world that either there is not there is no God and there is no morality or there is a God and there is a morality I don't believe you can make the cross over a belief that there is no God but there is an absolute morality that makes no sense but I believe you can make a logical argument for Neil ISM I choose not to that is that is my leap of faith my leap of faith is that bad things are bad even if all the people in the world think they're good that is that's the only leap of faith I ever took is to believe that to believe that it in in a world where everybody thinks slavery is right even the slaves slavery is so wrong that is the foundation of my belief so you know listen listen to other people if you don't want to change your beliefs and you know don't but it's it is a good thing to keep listening I mean I'm I have very set beliefs and very set ideas but I still listen to people who disagree with me especially reading books because those are the ones that are most thought out from dust 'lord gesture of the offense of a verse during the conversation last month you said that you consider video games a modern repository of art would you care to elaborate are there any games you might point to as exemplifying your perspective love your show you know what what I think is I think that art with basically with the invention of the camera I think art fell apart I don't believe abstract art is art per se what what I mean is I don't believe it relates anything really important about the human condition except kind of theories about the way we perceive things I don't believe it's moving I don't believe it's touching I don't believe it it gives you an actual experience I do believe that it's theories are interesting and sometimes I've seen a work of art and a work of abstract art and it's explained to me and I think yeah that's an interesting theory I still don't want that thing hanging on my wall you know whereas I do think that representative art is incredibly moving and beautiful and the difficulty of doing it Tom Stoppard the playwright said this one's one of the things about art is that it should be hard I don't think that some of the stuff Picasso did and he's the best I think of of the modern artists I don't think some of that is just hard enough to really interest me in videogames the imagination the basic imagination of humankind has come to life in sometimes incredibly gorgeous ways and the way you can maneuver in a video game so that you see you are submerged in that work of art is a new thing it is a new way of look of visual art I'm just talking about visual artistry that's all I'm talking about the games themselves I don't think of actually and maybe one or two of them has elevated itself to the level of art in in terms of storytelling but in the level of the visual arts I I think it's amazing stuff it is amazing stuff in the worlds that are created I don't know which give me one ICO is a beautiful world thank you my son Spencer is here we've played video games together for as long as one of us has been alive and that yeah ICO is a great one very beautiful soft imaginative world and I just think there's there's a lot of them actually and the fact that you move through them is a new thing in the arts and I think it's really beautiful all right let one last one I guess from Evan dear Clavin kind of but you know alright I recently found out that my mother cheated on my father they've been divorced for a long time now so this alone wouldn't be too much of a shock except the affair took place just before my little brother was conceived so there's a chance that the man who raised him is not his father I don't know what to do with this information I hate keeping this from my brother but at the same time I don't want to do anything to ruin the relationship he has with our dad at the same time I find myself losing a lot of respect for my mother both for lying about the affair for 24 years and for making me keep this secret do I tell him and risk fracturing my family further or do I continue the lie you know this is actually this is a very tough dilemma but the letter does not contain enough information for me to quite get it I'm not sure where you found out about this the letter suggests you found out about from your mother in which case you know the thing about your brother's parentage is suck your spin it sounds like you're spinning that in your imagination they did have birth control 20 years ago so like there's every reason to believe that that's not true that he is a legitimate child this sounds like something you should sit down with your mother and talk to her about because you do not want to ruin people's lives for no reason the fact that your mother had an affair if it did not affect your brother's parentage it's really nobody's business but hers at this point you don't have to spread that information it's not lying to people to keep a confidence I mean you have to sometimes keep confidences in life even with people you love but I think you should sit from what I can get from this letter I think you should sit down and and talk to her and find out the whole story because the stuff about your brother's parentage is just as far as I can tell in your imagination you know there's a lot of good questions here Rob we should maybe bring some of them back next week because I'm out of time tickety-boo news well yesterday there's no denying this was a bad day in Trump world not a good thing for Trump a lot of ominous things about how this is this investigation is gonna go on how the Democrats are gonna have fuel for their fire so it's not was not a great day in Trump world but at the same time there are a couple of stories that just came to me the two of them one is that the last known Nazi collaborator living in the United States a 95 year old former camp guard who played an indispensable role in the murders of thousands of Jews was deported to Germany from his New York City home completing what the u.s. Ambassador Germany called a difficult task this happened after Trump got the US ambassador Richard Grinnell to put more effort as he asked the Germans to put more effort into this and they got it done he this has been going on for years and years and years and this guy's 95 I doubt they'll actually prosecute him but at least he was deported and leased his life was made a little bit miserable which i think is not too much to ask that's Donald Trump doing it the other thing the other story that goes with it is that african-american business owners are on the rise according to the minority 20-18 small business trends survey listen to this the number of black owned small businesses in the u.s. increased by 400% in a year-over-year time period from 2017 to 2018 huh I wonder whose gets the credit for that 400 percent in a single year after Donald Trump's election so all I want to say about this is we hear that Trump is a racist we hear that he's a Nazi he is a really bad Nazi and a really bad racist I mean he's done really well with the judiciary he's done really well with the economy he's done really well fighting Isis he's done really well with regulations but he is a lousy Nazi and a lousy racist so we will hold him responsible for that we want better races and better Nazis in our government no I'm kidding these that's that is great so remember remember this when it comes when you have to vote in your district this November remember you may not like the guy you're voting for the congressman but if you don't want that these impeachment things to go forward you should do it and the RNC should pay attention to the black vote they should pay attention to getting the black vote out for Trump because I think it's going to be an important make an important difference if they are not kept home by the Democrats I got to say goodbye tomorrow is Thursday the last day before the clayvin this weekend do not miss it you'll want to suck all the clay Vinny goodness you can out of this like camels to lead you across the desert of the clayvin this weekend upcoming I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show we will see you again tomorrow the Andrew Clavin show is produced by Robert Sterling executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our supervising producer is Mathis Glover technical producer austin stevens edited by alex zingaro audio is mixed by Mike Carmina hair and makeup is by Jesuit vera and our animations are by Cynthia Angulo and Jacob Jackson the Andrew Clavin show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright for word publishing 2018
