00:00:01,438 --> 00:00:02,773
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, TO PRODUCE

2
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:04,041
ONE BILL THAT REPUBLICANS CAN

3
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:04,775
GET BEHIND AND THE PRESIDENT CAN

4
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:06,177
SIGN INTO LAW.

5
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:07,378
>> Laura: CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU

6
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:07,711
SO MUCH.

7
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:10,447
I JUST BOOK MOMENTS AGO, BY THE

8
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:12,116
WAY, EXCLUSIVELY WITH CHRISTIAN

9
00:00:12,116 --> 00:00:12,850
NIELSEN ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIP

10
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,485
WITH THE PRESIDENT AND PRESSING

11
00:00:14,485 --> 00:00:16,687
IMMIGRATION ISSUES.

12
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:17,855
>> GREAT TO HAVE YOU.

13
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:20,090
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE SET

14
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,025
TONIGHT.

15
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:23,027
YOU HAD A BIG, FIERY HEARING ON

16
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:24,662
CAPITOL HILL TODAY.

17
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:27,298
IT'S ALWAYS FUN.

18
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:31,669
SO THIS IS A BIG DAY FOR YOU.

19
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:33,604
KAMALA HARRIS DECIDED TO HIT YOU

20
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:35,839
ON THE ISSUE OF SEPARATING

21
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:36,840
CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS,

22
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,111
LET'S WATCH.

23
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:41,679
>> YOUR AGENCY WILL BE

24
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,447
SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR

25
00:00:43,447 --> 00:00:44,048
PARENTS.

26
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:45,516
>> WHAT WE WILL BE DOING IS

27
00:00:45,516 --> 00:00:46,483
PROSECUTING PARENTS WHO HAVE

28
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:47,685
BROKEN THE LAW JUST AS WE DO

29
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:48,385
EVERY DAY IN THE UNITED STATES

30
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:51,055
OF AMERICA.

31
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:53,324
>> I CAN APPRECIATE THAT, BUT IF

32
00:00:53,324 --> 00:00:54,024
THAT PARENT HAS A 4-YEAR-OLD

33
00:00:54,024 --> 00:00:55,859
CHILD, WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING

34
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,294
WITH THAT CHILD?

35
00:00:57,294 --> 00:00:59,263
>> THE CHILD UNDER LAGOS TO HHS

36
00:00:59,263 --> 00:01:00,264
FOR CARE AND CUSTODY.

37
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:00,998
>> THEY WILL BE SEPARATED FROM

38
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:03,834
THEIR PARENTS.

39
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:04,501
>> IT'S WHAT WE DO IN THE

40
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:08,272
UNITED STATES EVERY DAY.

41
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:09,440
>> Laura: IF THE IMMIGRATION

42
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,874
SOB STORY AS WE CALL IT ON THE

43
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:12,176
RADIO, WHICH IS NOT TO BE

44
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:12,910
DIMINISHED.

45
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,945
THESE ARE HEARTBREAKING

46
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:16,847
SITUATIONS.

47
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:18,882
HOW DO YOU AS DHS SECRETARY COME

48
00:01:18,882 --> 00:01:19,650
BACK WITH THE EMOTIONAL PUSH ON

49
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:19,950
THIS?

50
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,652
HOW CAN YOU DO THIS AND YOU KEPT

51
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:22,586
SAYING BASICALLY THIS IS THE

52
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:23,053
LAW.

53
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:25,055
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT?

54
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:27,057
>> IT IS THE LAW, AS YOU KNOW

55
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:28,459
AND I HAD AN EXCHANGE LAST WEEK

56
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:29,627
WITH A DIFFERENT SENATOR THAT

57
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:31,829
TRIED TO CUT ME OFF SAYING THIS

58
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,497
IS YOUR PHILOSOPHY AND I SAID

59
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:34,565
IT'S NOT A PHILOSOPHY, IF THE

60
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:35,666
LAW.

61
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:36,433
IF YOU ENTER OUR COUNTRY

62
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:38,802
ILLEGALLY WE WILL REFER YOU FOR

63
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:40,838
PROSECUTION AND PROSECUTE YOU.

64
00:01:40,838 --> 00:01:45,509
AT THE END OF EVERY SOB STORY,

65
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,644
73% BORDER ASSAULT, KATE

66
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:48,045
STEINLE, WHERE IS THE COMPASSION

67
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:49,880
FOR THE FLIP SIDE THE

68
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,314
CONVERSATION?

69
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:51,615
>> Laura: THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

70
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:52,316
DON'T GET THE SAME TREATMENT

71
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:54,418
FROM KAMALA HARRIS AND OTHERS

72
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:56,420
WHO WE WILL BE QUOTING TONIGHT

73
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,154
IN THE SHOW BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS

74
00:01:57,154 --> 00:01:59,023
A ONE-WAY STREET AND I THINK

75
00:01:59,023 --> 00:02:01,859
THOSE WHO ARE CHARGED WITH

76
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:03,661
ACTUALLY ENFORCING THE LAW ARE

77
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:05,863
ALWAYS MEANT TO BE THE BAD GUYS

78
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:08,032
AND YET THE AMERICAN CITIZENS

79
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:08,966
ELECTED DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE

80
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,567
THEY WANTED THAT SITUATION WERE

81
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:11,435
REVERSED.

82
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:12,469
IT'S AMERICA FIRST.

83
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:14,638
YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE A LOT AND A

84
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:15,239
LOT OF THIS DOESN'T GET

85
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,007
DISCUSSED.

86
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:18,909
H1B VISA ABUSE, THAT'S BRINGING

87
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:21,045
IN FOREIGN WORKER ABUSE.

88
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:21,912
WORKING WITH DOJ.

89
00:02:21,912 --> 00:02:23,580
WORKING ON OTHER WAYS TO PROTECT

90
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,648
THE AMERICAN WORKER.

91
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:25,949
AT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS

92
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,384
REALLY FRUSTRATING IS THIS

93
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:28,252
ASYLUM FRAUD.

94
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:29,453
WE'VE BEEN DOCUMENTING IT ON THE

95
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:29,753
SHOW.

96
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:32,156
WE HAVE AMERICAN LAWYERS FLYING

97
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,458
DOWN TO MEXICO COACHING CLIENTS.

98
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,427
THEY SAY IT'S ADVISING CLIENTS.

99
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:38,462
WHAT CAN YOU DO ON AN EXECUTIVE

100
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:39,196
LEVEL IF CONGRESS DOESN'T GET

101
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:41,665
OFF ITS BACKSIDE AND GET THIS

102
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:42,466
DONE?

103
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:43,567
>> IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING, I

104
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:44,735
GOT TO BE HONEST.

105
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:46,670
I REALLY SHARE THE PRESIDENTS

106
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,005
FRUSTRATION ON THIS AND THAT OF

107
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:48,539
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

108
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:51,041
THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS RIGHT

109
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,644
NOW THE THRESHOLD IS SO LOW,

110
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:54,645
ABOUT 80% PAST THAT INITIAL

111
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:55,913
INTERVIEW BUT ONLY 20% ARE

112
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:58,682
GRANTED ASYLUM BY A JUDGE, WHICH

113
00:02:58,682 --> 00:02:59,983
TELLS US THAT 80% OF THAT IS

114
00:02:59,983 --> 00:03:01,852
EITHER JUST A FLAT OUT FRAUD OR

115
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:03,020
SOMEBODY WHO THINKS THEY CAN

116
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,721
COME HERE BECAUSE THEY WANT A

117
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:06,357
JOB HERE.

118
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:07,491
LET'S NOT ASSIGNMENT.

119
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:08,659
I WANT TO REUNIFY WITH MY

120
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:09,460
FAMILY, THAT'S NOT ASYLUM.

121
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,928
I JUST WANT TO COME TO THE

122
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:11,829
UNITED STATES.

123
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:12,429
NOT ASYLUM.

124
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:14,064
WE HAVE LEGAL WAYS TO DO THAT

125
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:15,132
BUT IT'S NOT THROUGH ASYLUM.

126
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:17,067
>> Laura: WE HEAR THERE MIGHT

127
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:17,601
BE ANOTHER CARAVAN.

128
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:18,335
I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE GOT THE

129
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:22,239
NEW CARAVAN, A BIBLICAL, PEOPLE

130
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,140
ARE COMING UP AGAIN BECAUSE THEY

131
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,242
FEEL LIKE AS LONG AS THEY GET TO

132
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:28,245
THE BORDER THEY CAN GET INTO THE

133
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:29,847
COUNTRY AND THEY WILL ULTIMATELY

134
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:30,447
BE RELEASED, CORRECT?

135
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:32,649
OR ARE THEY NOT BEING RELEASED?

136
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:34,418
>> WE ARE METERING, WHICH MEANS

137
00:03:34,418 --> 00:03:35,652
THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE

138
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:36,854
RESOURCES TO LET THEM IN ON A

139
00:03:36,854 --> 00:03:37,688
PARTICULAR DAY THEY ARE GOING TO

140
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:38,455
HAVE TO COME BACK.

141
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:39,923
THEY WILL HAVE TO WAIT THEIR

142
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:41,425
TURN AND WE WILL PROCESS THEM AS

143
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:42,893
WE CAN, BUT THAT'S THE WAY THAT

144
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:43,894
THE LAW WORKS.

145
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:45,462
ONCE THEY COME INTO THE

146
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:46,196
UNITED STATES WE PROCESS THEM.

147
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:48,031
WE HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO FIX

148
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:48,699
THIS LOOPHOLE.

149
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,300
IT'S A HUGE GAPING LOOPHOLE THAT

150
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,436
WE NEED TO FIX BECAUSE IT IS SO

151
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:52,770
ABUSED.

152
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,437
>> Laura: ONE OF THE OTHER

153
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:54,505
THING IS THAT I THINK IS VERY

154
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:55,472
FRUSTRATING TO THE AMERICAN

155
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:57,875
PEOPLE IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

156
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:58,842
THESE REPEAT BORDER CROSSERS,

157
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:00,077
PEOPLE WHO HAVE JUMPED THE

158
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:02,346
BORDER MULTIPLE TIMES, HAVE BEEN

159
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:03,080
DEPORTED, COME BACK INTO THE

160
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,682
COUNTRY AND YET THEY STILL GET

161
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:06,884
THE OH, MY GOSH, WHAT ARE YOU

162
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:08,252
GOING TO DO ABOUT THE POOR

163
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:09,486
IMMIGRANTS, OUR COMMUNITIES ARE

164
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:11,054
BEING SHATTERED BECAUSE OF THIS

165
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:11,455
ENFORCEMENT.

166
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:15,459
YOU HAVE ACTUALLY OVERSEEN A

167
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:16,927
HUGE INCREASE IN BORDER

168
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:18,962
ENFORCEMENT AND WORKPLACE

169
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:20,664
ENFORCEMENT, RAIDS AND SO FORTH,

170
00:04:20,664 --> 00:04:22,833
WHICH I THINK ARE BEING WELCOMED

171
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,668
BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, BUT

172
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:25,269
AGAIN, THE MEDIA AND THE

173
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:27,204
DEMOCRATS ARE HITTING YOU FOR

174
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:29,773
SHATTERING COMMUNITIES.

175
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:32,476
>> LET'S GO BACK TO KATE.

176
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:33,944
HOW SAD IS IT THAT THE CONGRESS

177
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:35,846
OF THE UNITED STATES CAN'T PASS

178
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:38,482
A LAW TO SIMPLY INCREASE

179
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:39,850
PENALTIES FOR CRIMINALS WHO HAVE

180
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,285
BEEN DEPORTED TO COME BACK?

181
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:42,619
THE HOUSE PASSED IT, WE CAN GET

182
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,488
THE SENATE TO PASS IT.

183
00:04:44,488 --> 00:04:46,690
ALSO WE COMMUNITIES, WE JUST

184
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,058
BROKE THROUGH THAT HOUSE LAST

185
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:48,859
WEEK.

186
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:50,093
IF THE GENTLEMAN HAD DEPORTED

187
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:52,596
FOUR TIMES AND HAD FINAL ORDERS

188
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:53,630
OF REMOVAL FIVE TIMES AND WE ARE

189
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,566
STILL DEALING WITH HIM BECAUSE

190
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:57,367
WE CAN'T COMPLETELY -- THE

191
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:57,968
SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK.

192
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:58,635
YOU DEPORT HIM AND HE COMES

193
00:04:58,635 --> 00:04:59,736
BACK, WHICH IS WHY AS YOU KNOW

194
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:01,305
WE NEED A WALL.

195
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:02,005
>> Laura: WHAT'S HAPPENING

196
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:03,941
WITH THE NATIONAL GUARD AT THE

197
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:04,274
BORDER?

198
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:07,110
THAT WAS A BIG CONTROVERSY HERE

199
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,644
IN WASHINGTON.

200
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:08,779
I TRAVELED THE COUNTRY A LOT.

201
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,080
IT SEEMED AGAIN LIKE THE PEOPLE

202
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,348
ARE SAYING IT'S ABOUT TIME.

203
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:12,883
I HEAR THAT ON THE RADIO ALL THE

204
00:05:12,883 --> 00:05:13,183
TIME.

205
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:14,384
PEOPLE CALLING IT, WHY DON'T WE

206
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:15,252
GET THE NATIONAL GUARD, WHY

207
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:16,887
DON'T WE GET EXTRA HELP?

208
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:18,522
YOU HAVE NEWS ON MORE TROOPS NOW

209
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:20,891
GOING TO THE BORDER, TELL US

210
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:21,291
ABOUT THAT.

211
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,494
>> VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE

212
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:24,294
SUPPORT OF SECRETARY MATTIS AND

213
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:25,596
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

214
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:27,097
WE HAVE ABOUT 1600 NOW.

215
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:28,866
WITH OUR SECOND REQUEST WE WILL

216
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:29,867
HAVE ABOUT 2200.

217
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:31,468
ORIGINALLY WE WERE FOCUSED ON

218
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:33,036
BORDER PATROL SUPPORT BUT NOW

219
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:34,371
WE'VE EXTENDED IT SO WE WILL

220
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:36,006
SUPPORT THE FOLKS AT THE PORTS

221
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:36,640
OF ENTRY AND ARE INTEL AND

222
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,375
ANALYSIS.

223
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,277
IT'S A HUGE FORCE MULTIPLIER.

224
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:41,545
>> Laura: CALIFORNIA, JERRY

225
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:43,680
BROWN SAYING WE ARE NOT GOING TO

226
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,882
BE ASSISTING IN IMMIGRATION

227
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:45,849
ENFORCEMENT.

228
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:46,750
ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA

229
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,684
NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS ACTUALLY

230
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:48,852
DOING?

231
00:05:48,852 --> 00:05:50,287
>> THEY ARE SUPPORTING CBP.

232
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:51,321
THEY ARE JUST DOING IT BEHIND

233
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:51,722
THE SCENES.

234
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:52,723
THERE ARE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT

235
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:54,324
WE WORKED OUT.

236
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:55,893
THEY ARE SUPPORTING.

237
00:05:55,893 --> 00:05:56,760
WE WANT EACH GOVERNOR TO DO

238
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,094
MORE.

239
00:05:57,094 --> 00:05:58,529
I TALK TO EACH GOVERNOR, TALK TO

240
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,297
THEM ABOUT ONCE A MONTH TO GIVE

241
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:01,665
THEM THE NEW BORDER FIGURES,

242
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:04,334
WHAT WE ARE DOING.

243
00:06:04,468 --> 00:06:05,669
CALIFORNIA TO DO MORE.

244
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:06,370
>> Laura: WE JUST TALKED TO

245
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,106
BOB GOODLATTE ON THE SHOW AND

246
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:10,674
HE'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THESE

247
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:11,341
IMMIGRATION CENTRIST.

248
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:13,377
I CALLED THEM LIBERAL

249
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:14,878
REPUBLICANS, WHO ARE PUSHING

250
00:06:14,878 --> 00:06:18,448
THIS NEW DACA AMNESTY RIGHT NOW

251
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:20,250
AND TRYING TO PUSH THIS

252
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,752
DISCHARGE POSITION, IT RAN

253
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:22,286
THROUGH THE HOUSE OF

254
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:22,953
REPRESENTATIVES AT LEAST.

255
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:23,787
WHAT DO YOU WANT CONGRESS TO DO

256
00:06:23,787 --> 00:06:26,557
AND THIS PRESIDENT TO GET THIS

257
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:28,492
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT DONE THE

258
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:30,160
RIGHT WAY IN ORDER TO SATISFY

259
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,862
HIS PROMISES TO THE AMERICAN

260
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:32,462
PEOPLE?

261
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:33,697
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS

262
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,499
BEEN VERY CLEAR ON THIS.

263
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:35,966
IT'S VERY EASY.

264
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:38,268
WE NEED A WALL.

265
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:38,969
WE NEED TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES

266
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:41,672
AND THEN WE NEED PERSONNEL AND

267
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:43,707
RESOURCES THAT WE NEED.

268
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:44,408
APPREHENSION WITHOUT DETENTION

269
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:45,275
REMOVAL IS NOT BORDER SECURITY.

270
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:46,476
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE BEDS.

271
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:48,912
WE GOT TO BE ABLE TO APPREHEND,

272
00:06:48,912 --> 00:06:50,147
DETAIN, AND THEN REMOVE.

273
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:52,349
THAT'S JUDGES, LAWYERS,

274
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:53,750
DETENTION BETS.

275
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,118
IT'S A VERY EASY FORMULA TO HAVE

276
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:57,054
BORDER SECURITY.

277
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:58,388
BORDER SECURITY IS PART AND

278
00:06:58,388 --> 00:06:59,690
PARCEL TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF A

279
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,023
NATION.

280
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:01,191
>> Laura: HOW MANY PEOPLE,

281
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:03,460
ABOUT CROSSED THE BORDER LAST

282
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,695
MONTH IN THE UNITED STATES?

283
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:06,063
FAMILY UNITS.

284
00:07:06,063 --> 00:07:06,763
>> TAKE THE ORIGINAL CARAVAN

285
00:07:06,763 --> 00:07:07,130
LOCATION.

286
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,466
WE HAD ABOUT 100,000 PEOPLE THAT

287
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:10,901
CROSSED THAT PORT OF ENTRY EACH

288
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:11,702
DAY.

289
00:07:11,702 --> 00:07:13,103
MOST OF THAT IS LEGAL TRAFFIC

290
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:14,871
BUT AGAIN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

291
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:16,039
MILLIONS, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

292
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:18,508
OF PEOPLE THAT CROSS.

293
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:19,710
ABOUT 1.1 EACH DAY BETWEEN THE

294
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,110
TWO BORDERS.

295
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,112
IT'S A LOT OF TRAFFIC, BUT

296
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:23,680
BURIED IN THERE OF COURSE ARE

297
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,882
THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING TO ABUSE

298
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:26,650
THE SYSTEM.

299
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,718
IT'S A BROKEN SYSTEM.

300
00:07:27,718 --> 00:07:29,419
WITH GOT TO WORK WITH CONGRESS.

301
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,488
CONGRESS HAS GOT TO CLOSE THESE

302
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:31,822
NOBLES.

303
00:07:31,822 --> 00:07:33,724
>> Laura: 203% INCREASE IN

304
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:36,059
ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS FROM

305
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:38,161
MARCH 2017 TO MARCH 2018 I THINK

306
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:39,496
MY FAMILY UNITS OVERALL.

307
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:40,731
IT'S A HUGE INCREASE.

308
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:42,132
WHY?

309
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:42,933
WHAT'S GOING ON?

310
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:43,667
>> A COUPLE THINGS.

311
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,302
IF SOME OF THE LOOPHOLES ARE

312
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:46,536
THEY KNOW IF THEY CROSS BETWEEN

313
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:47,604
THE PORTS OF ENTRY NOTHING WILL

314
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:48,005
HAPPEN.

315
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,973
IF THEY BRING KIDS THEY WILL BE

316
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:50,340
RELEASED.

317
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,975
THE KIDS WILL BE RELEASED IN 20

318
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:52,743
DAYS UNDER A COURT CASE.

319
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:55,145
IF THEY ARE CRIMINAL THEY WILL

320
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:55,879
SERVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND

321
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,180
UNDER A DIFFERENT COURT CASE

322
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,048
THEY HAVE TO RELIST THEM IN SIX

323
00:07:58,048 --> 00:08:00,283
MONTHS BACK TO THE COMMUNITIES,

324
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:01,251
THE CRIMINALS.

325
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:02,285
IF THERE OTHER THAN MEXICAN WE

326
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:03,720
CAN PUT THEM IN EXPEDITED

327
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,222
REMOVAL IF THEY ARE CHILDREN

328
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:05,589
INVOLVED.

329
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:06,356
THEY KNOW BETTER THAN CONGRESS,

330
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:08,258
THEY KNOW BETTER THAN MOST OF

331
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:10,293
US, SO THEY KNOW THE LOOPHOLES,

332
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:10,927
THEY ARE EXPLOITING THEM.

333
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:11,828
>> Laura: ARE YOU ON THE

334
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:12,863
PRESIDENT GOOD NOW?

335
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:14,297
THERE WAS SOME CONCERN LAST

336
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:14,598
WEEK.

337
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:16,767
HE'S VERY IMPATIENT FOR CHANGE,

338
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,769
I'VE NOTICED THAT, MADAM

339
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:20,070
SECRETARY.

340
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,672
>> HE'S FRUSTRATED, AND RIGHTLY

341
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:22,973
SO.

342
00:08:22,973 --> 00:08:24,474
CAN YOU IMAGINE, HERE IS THE

343
00:08:24,474 --> 00:08:25,175
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

344
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:27,444
SAYING I WANT TO SECURE THIS

345
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:27,878
COUNTRY.

346
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:28,879
AMERICANS MUST COME FIRST AND

347
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,480
CONGRESS IS SAYING WE DON'T HAVE

348
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,115
TIME, WE ARE BUSY, WITH GOT TO

349
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:32,883
GO ON RECESS.

350
00:08:32,883 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Laura: YOU WERE HERE FOR
