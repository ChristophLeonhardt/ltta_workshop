Ismaeel, I need a
better look from you.
I want you to give
yourself a haircut.
What are you shaking
your head no for?
I can’t. I can’t.
I can’t cut my hair.
Why not?
Because I’ve already
gained a few pounds,
and I’m just going to look
like a little fat chubby boy,
and that’s not going
to be ideal for me.
(SINGING) I got my eyes on you.
Put it down there.
Let me do it.
Put it down.
Do you think it’s too high?
I’m thinking about
jumping, dude.
As if I didn’t have
enough injuries.
What did you do?
What is this as a result of?
Don’t —
O.K.
If I could tell you, I would.
I got to do it again. Because
I want to be confident in it.
“Turn up!”
I would say stabbing pain.
I feel like I’m being
stabbed in the foot.
Trying to relive something I
was doing when I was younger,
and then failed.
Singer: “To the motherfuckers who said
we wasn’t going to be shit,
looks like I’m going
to be something!”
Crowd: “I’m going to be something!”
Singer: “I’m going to be something!”
Crowd: “I’m going to be something!”
Shh.
Something else, man.
“Team deathmatch.
Get out there and
earn your paychecks.”
Oh!
Huh?
What are you doing?
We just bought it.
There’s got to be a
way they can tune it up
for free or something.
There shouldn’t be
nothing wrong with it.
I mean, it’s been running fine.
I thought I was done
with buying lawn mowers.
Try not to be too upset, honey.
I’m not, honey.
He wasn’t trying to
do nothing wrong.
No, no.
I was watching him
out the window.
I didn’t see him do anything.
Got yourself in a little
predicament, don’t you?
How are you going to
get out of this one?
There you go.
You’re almost there.
Well, this stuff, you have
to just kind of take your time.
He’s pushing lawn mowers.
He’s 23, honey.
You’re 62, almost 63.
I know Dad’s mad, 
boy. Heated.
I’m on the six-month plan.
I'm out.
I know once I get to
Chicago, there’s no stopping me.
You know what I mean?
It’s going to be straight up
business moves, networking,
all of that, right?
Honestly, though, I really want
it to be about four months.
Ismaeel.
Yeah?
Drive it like it’s a
Mercedes or a Bentley.
 All right.
Assalamu alaikum.
Wa alaikum assalam.
“Team death match.
Get out there and
earn your paychecks.”
Sick!
Oh, somebody hit me.
(SINGING) “Just so you could
have something …”
(SINGING) I’m with you.
“You.”
You feel that momentum,
you feel that
body shifting over.
I like that feeling.
(SINGING) “I’m with you.
You…”
It’s no joke.
“Cover yourself!”
Got him.
I like it when these
noises come out.
Make me feel
like I’m in there.
You know what I’m saying?
You know, he really likes
being with you all, you know?
Like, the way he grew up
with his brothers around.
And everybody’s
grown now,
and you’ve gone off
to your own lives.
He doesn’t quite
know what to do.
I got you, bro.
Little nephew.
Wow.
Kamau, thank you, man.
I’m really happy, dude.
That’s incredible.
Wow.
I can’t believe it.
Somebody you can, you
know, look out for.
Can give him some
food, take him to the park.
You know what I mean?
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Amazing.
And here I was thinking
I got all this time.
I’m good.
Thought I was going to
be a teenager forever.
Oh, shit.
