as you know there's now a vacancy on the Supreme Court and if you turn in Monday at nine o'clock I think you're going to be extremely happy after days of teasing a brilliant ream Court pick Donald Trump has reportedly narrowed his listed three circuit court judges with a planned reality show style primetime reveal on Monday because of course showbiz aside Trump's pick will likely shift the Supreme Court even further to the right and impact some of the biggest landmark decisions of our time like roe v wade the 1973 ruling that extended a woman's constitutional right to privacy to the right to make her own medical decisions including about abortion Supreme Court nominees vying for confirmation tend to tout their respect for precedent at hearings in an attempt to ease lawmakers concerns about the potential reversal of landmark rulings we saw this most recently at Neal Gore such as hearing just last year precedent is kind of like our shared family history as judges it deserves our respect Roe versus Wade decided in 1973 the press to the United States Supreme Court good judge will consider it as precedent of the United States Supreme Court worthy as treatment of precedent like any other well that idea respecting precedent will likely be deployed again as conservatives eager to see roe v wade overturned seek to keep that enthusiasm in check publicly so as not to lose the votes of key senators in the confirmation process but in reality precedent has not always been a deterrent for justices in ruling against previously upheld landmark cases and once Trump's pick is concern it's confirmed make no mistake about it a majority right-wing court would have the votes to overturn Roe which if it happened would instantly threaten reproductive rights in dozens of states across the country joining me now is Maya Wiley senior vice president for social justice at the new school Danny Cevallos MSNBC legal analyst writer and director civvy tamarkan and jill wine banks former assistant Watergate special prosecutor thank you all for being here and I know the two ladies are at a disadvantage on remote but I want to come to the table first now I want to first start by playing you Donald Trump back in 2016 when he's running for president he's asked directly about overturning Roe here's what he said do you want to see the court overturned well if we put another two or perhaps three justices on that's really what's going to be had that's will happen and that'll happen automatically in my opinion because I am putting pro-life justices on the court that's the promise that he made we now have some dueling headlines in two conservative-leaning newspapers the Washington Examiner goes all in it says overturn Roe just do it get a justice on there and overturn it The Wall Street Journal calls that fear a scare campaign The Wall Street Journal saying nope not gonna happen people are just being hysterical about it and I know the two of you differ on this issue Danny you have a piece that's up right now on MSNBC calm that you say that the magic words starring decisis which we hear in these confirmation hearings president will be the reason that it doesn't happen and I know that you've a different opinion Maya so first let me let you explain - anyway you think that the Wall Street Journal is correct that it won't happen first the idea that whether or not Roe is overturned is simply a show of hands of the current justices and of poll as to whether or not they like abortion or their anti-abortion that's not how the Supreme Court works and that's where starry decisis comes in it's the idea that the court follows precedent now anyone people on both sides would agree that the reasoning behind Roe it stands on shaky ground it rests on the idea that the right to a the right to privacy inherent in an abortion emanates from the penumbra that it glows from the rights of the Constitution even though it's not explicitly in the text but the reality is over the last several decades people have come to rely upon that right and it is a right that was created by the court these are things that a court considers in deciding whether or not to overrule precedent it doesn't do so lightly it considers the fact that people have relied on this right and it would be taking away a constitutional right if it overturned Roe no you have a different opinion my ago well I do have a different opinion although not in Danny's primary point which is unlike Trump's statement justices can't just wake up one morning and say oh that's not the law of the land anymore right now no longer think the Constitution protects the woman's right to choose it has to come through cases that come to the Supreme Court that then it accepts the case to be heard right and then has to go through a lengthy process of hearing argument receiving briefs making a decision but what it does do is we have so narrowed with 29 states in this country that have already restricted women's access to making reproductive health choices Mississippi literally has said it's 15 weeks now this 15 weeks you have to get an abortion and there's only one clinic in the state because the Supreme Court has said that it is now whether there's an undue burden of your right to access an abortion what we've essentially created is a way for the court to so greatly narrow to support state laws that basically make it near impossible in Mississippi ninety one percent of women do not have an abortion clinic in their County and there's one provider in the entire state yeah so essentially you can make it so burdensome call it constitutional say you didn't over over turn wait roe v wade and essentially have women not able to make choices over their bodies and and Danny you know on the question of beyond the the different ways death by a thousand cuts that you know the courts could be used and legislations used to restrict abortion rights on just the question of whether or not Gorsuch himself was a he wrote a book on precedent it's all about precedent you talk about starry decisis the magic words the course even recently has thrown precedent outright so this is the tape from the takecare block he repeatedly rejected and called into question long-standing Supreme Court precedent most obviously in Janis versus ask me justice Gorsuch joined the courts other conservatives to overrule a forty one-year-old president upholding the constitutionality of state laws that allow public sector unions to require non-members to pay their fair share of the cost of collective bargaining he just threw it out you've seen the concern majority on the court by 5'4 say Bush v Gore we're just gonna make this ruling that's gonna give up a Republican who's in our party the White House and we're gonna say don't ever do it again so it's not like they are very consistent necessarily the conservative majority is a power majority they kind of do what they want right you brought up Janice and Janice is a great example of one instance where they do overrule president but other than Janice and I know that sounds like a stretch but really the reality is other than Janice this does not happen very often it is very difficult to find cases where precedent is overruled in a way that it was with Janice the reality is because that just happened that Janice case just came down a lot of people are pointing to it as an example of the fact that the Supreme Court will overrule precedent but I think it stands for a greater point which is yes it will but it doesn't really do so very often but doesn't it do it when it is the ideological bent of that majority I mean Clarence Thomas has made it very clear he wants Roe gone right he is not shy about it and I don't know maybe it's just that the court now seems just to be another extension of politics that a lot of Americans don't trust them to do what the court typically does they just feel like their five Republican conservatives are gonna do what they want well I think this is the point we have come to a place where the Supreme Court has become as partisan as our politics and it was not supposed to be that way right we were one of the things that Barack Obama did as president was actually start to nominate fairly centrist jurists right Merrick garland being a prime example so that I didn't work and in work right so we have so politicized the process that now people see it as another version of what's broken inside the beltway but I will say that one of the power of the majority is not just story decisis it's not just whether or not it will stick to precedent or not stick to president just deciding what case not to hear can essentially help under undermine rights and privileges that people have currently protected take the death penalty the court turned down two death penalty cases that we're going to call the question of some of the constitutionality of the death penalty yeah that's part the power of a majority that doesn't require overruling precedent but can actually impact literally people's lives okay let me bring the other two guys in here at the city and chiller are as set at disadvantage City I'm gonna go to you first the PERT one of the people who was a front-runner ami Kony Behrendt very religiously conservative personally this is how she responded when asked if roe v wade could be overturned in the supreme court this is from November of 2016 take a listen I think the question is how much freedom the court is willing to let States have in regulating abortion I don't think that the core case that rose core holding that you know women have a right to an abortion I don't think that would change but I think the question of whether people can get very late term abortions you know how many restrictions can be put on clinics I think that would change Sevilla does that does that sort of make you believe it as Danny does that it's unlikely that this court even if you put another Gorsuch on would overrule Roe well the issue is really what Amy Barrett just said you know Roe has existed in name only for so many women in this country for so many years there have been on a state-by-state basis over a thousand restrictions put in place since Roe was handed down and when the Casey versus Pennsylvania decision came about in 92 that said the measure was an undue burden no one defined what the undue burden was so the reality is that the incursion and erosion of reproductive rights has been occurring all across the country I think there's only nine or ten states where that right is secure because if you do not have access if you do not have health care that will cover an abortion and as a result of the ban on Medicaid covering that you do not have the opportunity to exercise those rights so in many ways the debate over the constitutionality and precedent is not going to fit the majority of the women in this country who do not have access and for whom the undue burden does prevent the exercising of their rights that's an important point you know and because the politics of this Jill when banks are also there as well because the restrictions are happening regardless of whether a case ever gets to the Supreme Court they're already happening as Sevilla just mentioned but for women Republicans senators the the politics are very dicey right now Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Susan Collins of Maine are really under the gun to not approve a Justice who would overturn Roe here is how Susan Collins responded to the question of whether she would react to a Supreme Court pick who might jeopardize the right to abortion take a listen I think I've made it pretty clear that if a nominee has demonstrated hostility to roe v wade and has said that they're not going to abide by that long-standing precedent that i could not support you need that nominee but doesn't that just mean that as long as the person says sorry decisis the magic words susan collins could say i can vote for that person cuz they said they respect president it does mean that you are absolutely correct and that's the wrong question the question is how much whittling away will Susan Collins and others allow how much will a new justice be able to narrowly define what undue burden is Sevilla is absolutely correct that that's really where we're at is Roe has been limited by this concept of it's okay to regulate it as long as it doesn't present an undue burden on the exercise of the rights that were granted by Roe but what is an undue burden can be defined in a way for example Ohio has passed a law that says six weeks is the limit and when you can get an abortion most women do not even know they're pregnant during that period of time so of course to me that is a clear undue burden but to Amy Cohn and Barrett it may not be and that's the risk that we're facing now and that's why this choice is so important and there's another important issue that we need to look at in what is happening at the Supreme Court and the nominee and that's that there will be a lot of other issues that threaten our rights that need to be taken into account and there's also the question of how this justice will be able to vote or whether he'll have to repeat or she will have to recuse themselves and issues like can the president be indicted because that's likely to come up and it's a reason why they should not have the vote right now that we need to have the investigation of President Trump completed before the vote ever happens Jill wine banks who is just expertly teased without knowing she did it our next block which is coming up next very quickly what's your PIN today Jill today is a swamp creature because we've gotten rid of
