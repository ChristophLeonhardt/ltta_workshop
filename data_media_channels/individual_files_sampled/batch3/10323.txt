hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report yeah I'm one one-thousandth part Cherokee Stacy we all are max we all are in fact I have a headline here up up up up up and away that is the u.s. deficit the US government paid a whopping 523 billion u.s. dollars in interest and fiscal 2018 here's a chart going back to Oh 1988 which is quite interesting you see that the interest that we pay annually on our debt is rising rising rising despite interest rates going down that whole time we're still paying more and more every year which goes against what everybody always says is oh all these debts are manageable because interest rates are so low yeah well you know America is like a guy he won the lottery and blows it after World War two we ruled the world we had the most gold we had the soundest currency we had low interest rates and we were American century ready to go and like the profligate lottery winner that blows it all here we are in 2018 having kind of blown it we have too much debt 21 trillion of debt and the interest on that debt is now as you point out something like a half a trillion dollars annually which is getting close to the annual budget deficit and which means well actually the budget deficit annually is 200 billion dollars more than that 500 billion dollars is about what we pay for say Medicare so it's the equivalent taking care of the health of all the elderly people in America is just interest not just interest on the debt so when the interest on it on the debt gets to a point where your money printing Ponzi scheme that is a Federal Reserve Bank fails you then enter a currency collapse you enter a hyperinflationary you know venezuelan type currency collapse and of course the american ego will tell you that that's impossible here in the land of the free home of the brave but you know empires come and go okay let's look at one thing I want to point out that we went off the gold center to 1971 so in a way I don't blame anybody who runs America for just doing this because why not people are sending you their real goods and services for free essentially so why not rack up these huge debts plus we have to rack up huge debts otherwise you can't maintain the US dollar as the world's reserve currency so if the rest of the globe based on us sending all our manufacturing sending our wealth overseas in order for them to grow the economy globally to grow trade globally to grow the only way that can happen is if we send more and more dollars over there and the only way we could do that is to consume more and more of this stuff and send them these dollars in order to maintain that exorbitant privilege that saw us basically end up going off the u.s. gold standard going bankrupt the world kept the sherrod the charade going and here we are at this point that we've racked up all this fake debt based on fake fiat currency so why not yes you know it's a question of there's just all this money you had me going with that charade reference system I you know we should just do this entire show you in charades it's on one point and see how far we get into it cool but there are so many words because I lived in the UK for so long that there are so many words I get to and I get into this like kind of conundrum like what do I do I say the British pronunciation of Sherrod or do I say charade like an American would say so I I get to that point and I kind of lose track of what I'm saying because I've got to say either the British way or the Americans like a Midlantic kind of you know accent I suppose extend with the potpourri of verbiage now the only thing that would have been better if you're racking up all this debt yeah that's never gonna get paid back but it's based on a fake system anyway it's all fiat right so why not build better infrastructure why not build high-speed rail across the country from Chicago to New Orleans from you know Miami to Detroit from New York to Los Angeles why not you that and get the you know overseas promise obvious because you know we know from history that the car manufacturing Lobby doesn't want to have high-speed rails or trains to interfere with the car lobbyists the by the way the what you described there of foreign governments needing to accumulate dollars etc that's of course the trippin dilemma which folks can look that up on Google and find out all about this interesting chapter in economics the trippin dilemma so let's move on to the next headline it's kind of related to the first one so that's the u.s. paid five hundred and twenty three billion dollars in just interest on all their debt that they've accumulated is something like twenty one trillion dollars since the founding of this nation and it gets faster and faster every year well here's the US budget deficit and that gets added to the debt from previous so this will you know this is the the national debt is accumulated over the past 200 years the deficit is every year how much you're adding to that debt here's the US budget deficit as well say eight hundred and ninety eight billion dollars topping forecasts the US budget deficit widened to eight hundred and ninety eight billion dollars in the eleven months through August succeeding the Congressional Budget Office forecasts for the first full fiscal year under the trump presidency the budget deficit rose by one third in October to August period from six hundred and seventy four billion in the same timeframe in a year earlier the Treasury Department said spending rose by seven percent to three point eight eight trillion outpacing revenue gains of just one percent to two point nine nine trillion revenue from corporations fell to a hundred and sixty three billion down by seventy one billion from a year ago I want to point out that's close to how much Jeff Bezos is worth so that's all that is given by corporations to the US government is just a hundred and sixty three billion dollars annually I won't get into how much we the citizens have to pay but it's a lot more than that yeah well it's apartheid it's an american-style apartheid they should remake that that show love American style and they should make it apartheid American style it's about families that are stuck all the taxes and having to borrow at 20% versus the people running the ship that are worth billions and pay zero for the money they're borrowing that's interest rate apartheid apartheid american-style we mentioned in the previous episode that Jared Kushner pays 0% in tax and because he buys commercial property which gets to he gets to write off all the taxes against his personal income I'm gonna turn to another headline to show you the mentality of how those wealthy stay wealthy get wealthier versus the rest of the population because this is a remarkable story with some remarkable basically quotes here from the people pushing this program thousands lined up for zero down payment subprime mortgages Magdalene Altidore lost her home to foreclosure during the subprime mortgage crisis but this week she was first in line at a four-day event in Miami where borrowers with poor credit were offered no down payment low interest rate loans the event is one of several being held in cities across America this year run by the nonprofit Boston based brokerage neighborhood assistance corporation of america or naka bank of america is back in the program with ten billion dollars they're offering fifteen to thirty year fixed rate loans at four and a half percent which is below a market rates that a subprime borrower normally be able to get but the difference in this program is that investors can't be they can't be investors they have to live in the home so in terms of the mentality how the rich get richer and the poor stay poor get poorer here's a quote from the guy who's putting this on like I said his name is Marx mr. Marx from naca people have skin in the game in a real way the people that walk away are higher income people who look to home ownership as an investment just like buying stocks and bonds working people look at their investment in home ownership for their family for their neighborhood for themselves so he's saying don't worry people aren't going to walk away from these mortgages like they did in the last financial crisis because the last financial crisis was caused by investors who don't who look at their home as a way to earn money and speculate and get richer these people these poor people that were given these loans to earn looking to build you know they're not looking to get wealthy from it there's just looking for a community and things like that but that's how they end up getting poor and people speculating and rigging the system and playing the system get wealthier old wine new bottles you know it's propaganda that of course that this is it's different this time I mean this is the famous old saw on Wall Street this time it's different the banks are engaged in fraudulent lending practices as they were in 2008 as they have been for 30 years as they get caught and as banks pay massive fines whether it's Wells Fargo JP Morgan or any of these other credit facility sure the laws are changed to make it no longer illegal to make fraudulent loans this of course will create a huge credit crisis once again and the banks will get bailed out and the people who are engaging in the speculation with these fraudulent loans that they're unfortunately having to endure will get wiped out but the thing about it is we know from history that people continue to make babies and as long as babies are born the banks I have customers to rip off well again like I don't blame the US for going into huge amount of debts because they have to in order to maintain their exorbitant privilege of having the US dollar as a world reserve currency like and they're getting stuff for free so why work hard and try to actually pay real money for the stuff people are willing to give you for free here these people are able to line up and get a four and a half percent 30-year mortgage unlike in the subprime crisis when they had those adjustable rate mortgages that suddenly went from having a $500 a month mortgage payment to 2,000 so they're not gonna get that here they're getting free money and they get a house so the and the worst that could happen is they get to walk away in two years or three years when the property market crashes there's no reason why they shouldn't do this it's absolutely it makes sense naca itself this it basically I think they're providing some greenwashing for Bank of America because it's under a neighborhood Assistance Program and they themselves get $3,000 per mortgage that they filter through this system the other thing is look at this mainstream media this is what they say is different this time than during the subprime crisis remarkable another big difference today is the housing market itself home prices have been rising strongly and there is a critical shortage of entry-level homes for sale if a borrower finds themselves in financial straits it is far easier today to sell the home quickly altered or remember the woman I mentioned at the top who is applying for one of these loans its confident she can make the low monthly payments this time around a small price she says for something far more valuable I think a home 10-15 years from now that's an investment she said home ownership is freedom look I'm willing to go on record and predict that these loans from Bank of America within 24 months they will discover and something they didn't see that the loans actually there's a contingency that they become invalid during certain credit events like rising interest rates or something like that and a crisis will ensue and Bank of America will say we had no idea we couldn't see this coming oh how did this happen we don't know and then they'll get a bailout and this poor idiot woman will be homeless you know shooting up smack on the street in San Francisco somewhere wondering what happened what happened is interest rate apartheid dear you live in an apartheid state and you're on the wrong neighborhood you live it in the Bantustan except it's at 4% anyway speaking of Bantu stance we got to take a break and when we come back much more coming your way welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to go to Blighty and talk to Alistair McLeod of gold money.com the credit cycle is on the turn that's the title of his latest report at gold money.com and as always full disclosure I do own a small position in gold money I'll stir welcome back to the Kaiser report and there max all right so I've read a lot of your research over the years and occasionally you hit one out of the park with that's a baseball expression by the way for you Brits might not know what I'm saying this is a really a seminal piece this is a very major piece you've put out here the credit cycle is turning interest rates are rising they had been falling for over 30 years Alistair you say the cycle is actually turning so tell us about it what indicators do you see is this really happening well the first indicator is obvious and that is they can't really go below zero I know that they've tried to put it in below zero but I mean it's that's a load of nonsense as you know so that's the first thing they can't really go any lower after the next credit cycle the other thing that worries me is that if you look at the rate of inflation in America it is very understated we all know that the CPI says something like 3% we believe it but actually if you look at you know a constant basket of prices is closer to 10% as independent analysts have said and there will come a point where when bond yields start rising when the fundamentals behind the dollar suddenly are accepted as not being at all good for example you've got a trade deficit running - well it's gonna get up to a billion trillion dollars and that's a trillion dollars of net selling of the dollar also the foreigners already own the dollar I mean I this this is on on us figures they already owned 22 trillion dollars of interest if you like of which four trillion dollars there were four trillion dollars is cash and that was in the middle of 2017 they will have more now that is for sure what's been driving the dollar up has rarely been the interest rate differential between the Euro you can borrow in Euros the the interbank rate is minus 0.3 percent something like that you can borrow it three months buy US Treasuries which will yield you 2.2 percent you've got a two and a half percent strip to take out of that you gear it up ten times because that's the quality of the asset that you're buying and you've got 25 percent on your money you know what's not to like about it and that basically is what has been driving the dollar nothing else really I mean this idea that the US economy is absolutely marvelous and it's gonna be good for equities it is it is strong the US economy is strong because there is a huge deficit driving it there is an orthotic push going into it this doesn't happen elsewhere this has created the distortion when that distortion unwinds and the dollar starts falling then I think you'll find that not only is the dollar falling but the forum is no longer buying US Treasury debt and under their circumstances the yield law gives long the UK will continue to rise and rise substantially and then we ask the question what is the rate of inflation in other words what I'm saying is there will come a point where people start thinking very very differently now we know the rate of inflation is closer to 10% than 3% so what rate interest rates be what should the yellow new US Treasuries be so you can see how we can rapidly turn from a low interest rate environment into a high rate interest rate environment and that's basically my thesis all right well let's look at this you know using what I would call the coloring book you know analysis of broad strokes so you talk about the credit cycle turning which would mean that credit interest rates start to move higher and of course that's a big negative for bonds and begs the question why now because over the past five or six years major financial pundits around the world have called for a top and the bond market and they've gotten it wrong year after year after year and so why why now Alistair mean if you're right you would be the only guy in the world to get the timing correct and I'm talking about the smartest guys in the world have made this amiss they call it the Widowmaker you know the absolute horrible they've gone short bonds way too early so why now Alistair what what is it what what are you seeing the timing why now well I'm seeing no basically because the yield along the u curve has gone up very substantially in the last week or two I mean if you look at the ten year it was yielding about three percent it's it ran up to three point two two percent at the tail end of last week and it's backed off a little bit at the moment which you know one can understand but when you get moves like that along the yield curve it starts undermining asset values and particularly equity asset values and this is something I think that nobody wants to see but you know the relationship is always the same you get you know bonds peak first equities peak second properties then peak third and so it's the financial assets that is the problem that we face at the moment and I think that we're going to see higher yields in the bond market that will undermine equities and then of course that starts spreading into the underlying economy people start looking at their business plans and they think hold on a minute we've got interest rates rising so our original assumption in terms of return on capital we've got to revise those we're finding the costs arising input costs arising faster than we thought we didn't expect them to really rise very much but they are definitely rising we're not making any money on this new plan we've got for making this widget or that widget so you can see that suddenly business starts turning around and being less optimistic and then starts cutting back on planned off and it's at that point that the back stop to get worried what I'm describing is that is the classic end of cycle and credit cycle development I get that we're at the end of a cycle and at the end of a cycle you see a reverse and in this case that would mean higher rates but we're also talking about the fact that we live in an era starting with Alan Greenspan and continuing through Ben Bernanke Janet Yellen and perhaps the current Fed Chairman and central bankers around the world that a hue to the orthodoxy of what became known as the Greenspan put and that is to say activist central bankers who do not respond to cycles they simply keep flooding markets with fresh money whenever there's a danger of a bond market moved down so what would stop the central bankers around the world who recently expanded their balance sheets by trillions of dollars the u.s. went from less than a trillion to something like five trillion on their balance sheet the ECB has got trillions of euros on their balance sheet that's sucking up all these bad bonds and preventing yields from rising well what's this say that we won't just have another round of maybe quantitative easing for or you know massive bond purchases by central banks in to the tune of fifteen or twenty trillion dollars worth once again like what stops them from just doing more of the same I'll stir what I can say is dream on the problem they face is that you have got pent up price inflation building all the time and this is why I mentioned the fact that the way the the CPI is cast as the sort of evolving basket designed to reduce the apparent rate of inflation there is going to come a point where people begin to think hold on a minute this is not right the rate of inflation price inflation is actually far higher than the official statistics tell us and when they get hold of that idea basically the idea that you can if you like print money and get out of you all get out of jail that way that is no longer an option because of the inflationary consequences that you add on top of all that money that's been printed over the last ten years okay so to just summarize that a bit so in other words we know what's been going on and we know also now that the modus operandi for allowing this to go on has been the misrepresentation of the actual inflation numbers the CPI numbers they are constantly adjusted through what are called quote hedonic adjustments etc you know Margaret Thatcher was big during at this back in the Thatcher era she famously would recalculate how inflation was calculated that was carried on now since the Thatcher Reagan era and so this idea of inflation being at 2% is a complete falsehood you're saying it's actually closer to 10% but it's hidden because you have the ability through mass media etc to kind of hide this fact but so you're saying that the ability so that the crux of your argument is that the ability to hide inflation has run its course and that will trigger a reversion to the mean correct yes another way you could put it far more simply is that you can prove anything you want with statistics except the truth and the problem is the people will wake up to that very to the if you like the reality of that very simple a for ISM right so just walk us through and what this means you know so an interest rates rise how will the financial world around change in a way that we haven't seen in more than 35 years so what walk us through you know what actually happens you're an average guy suddenly you've got a 35 year trend reversing bond prices are now on the way down instead of up which is different than the past 35 years so how does this reverberate through the system well the first thing that happens max is that bond yields start rising substantially and governments have difficulty funding that their debt they will be behind the curve as it were when it comes to to to funding and you'll find that debt auctions will always be disappointing so you got higher high yields you'll have equity markets going down and down and down and the general area of crisis will gather and that will happen at a time when is virtually impossible in fact it will be impossible for central banks to print enormous money just trap money at the problem like they did during the Lehman crisis so this crisis is going to be very very difficult different if you like from from the Lehman crisis so we're looking at a world where we run into inflation and the inflation is going to continue and that is going to continue to be a problem and that is going to be the root of undermining asset values and particularly those asset values where there's a lot of borrowing supporting the prices right so we've got less than a minute and we're gonna have you on for another segment if that's ok but in the remaining 40 seconds or so let me tell you what Donald Trump recently said he said the Fed is crazy for raising rates your thoughts well he's a politician isn't he I mean everybody you know they don't like high rates but the fact of the matter is that the rate has to be appropriate for the conditions and I'm afraid that mr. Trump is in doubting and wishful thinking and incidentally there is a convention that politicians do not interfere with the central banks in the management things even though you and I know that they tend to screw it up because they don't understand the credit cycle fair enough all right I'll sir I'll be another segment forthcoming but thanks for being on the Kaiser report that's my pleasure max all right that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max guys are in Staci Herbert like to thank our guest alistair McCloud of gold money calm he's want to reach us on Twitter it's kinds of report until next time I owe you you
