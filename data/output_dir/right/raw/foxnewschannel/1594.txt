BE VERY EASY TO ACHIEVE IN A

2
00:00:01,275 --> 00:00:02,810
REASONABLE TIME.

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,313
BRET.

BRIAN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

15
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:19,594
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

16
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:21,162
>> Bret: LET'S START WITH IRAN

17
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:22,663
AND WHAT SECRETARY POMPEO SAID

18
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:23,464
TODAY.

19
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:35,443
HOW REALISTIC DOES THIS      SEC

20
00:00:35,443 --> 00:00:35,476
HOW REALISTIC DOES THIS      SEE

21
00:00:35,476 --> 00:00:35,510
HOW REALISTIC DOES THIS      SEA

22
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,543
HOW REALISTIC DOES THIS      SEY

23
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:35,777
HOW REALISTIC DOES THIS      SE,

24
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:36,511
STATE DEPARTMENT, ADMINISTRATION

25
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:37,078
BELIEVE THAT THESE 12

26
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:37,779
STIPULATIONS WILL ACTUALLY BE

27
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:38,479
AGREED TO EVENTUALLY BUY IRAN.

28
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,347
>>  >> IS A OF REQUIREMENTS THAT

29
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:40,047
SECRETARY POMPEO CALLED OUT

30
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:41,883
TODAY IN HIS SPEECH IN IRAN IS A

31
00:00:41,883 --> 00:00:42,583
VERY REASONABLE AND REALISTIC

32
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,217
LIST.

33
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:46,788
IT COULD GO THROUGH THE LIST,

34
00:00:46,788 --> 00:00:49,223
FOCUSING ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR

35
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:49,724
WEAPONS PROGRAM.

36
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:52,760
SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM.

37
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,364
IT'S FOREIGN WARRANTLESS

38
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:56,397
IT'S FOREIGN WARRANTLESS       W

39
00:00:56,397 --> 00:00:56,431
IT'S FOREIGN WARRANTLESS       R

40
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:56,464
IT'S FOREIGN WARRANTLESS

41
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:57,365
IT'S FOREIGN WARRANTLESS       T

42
00:00:57,365 --> 00:00:57,398
IT'S FOREIGN WARRANTLESS       F

IT'S FOREIGN WARRANTLESS       N

IT'S FOREIGN WARRANTLESS       S

45
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:59,233
IT'S FOREIGN WARRANTLESS       .

46
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:01,302
ALL OF THESE ARE POSITIONS THAT

47
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,603
EUROPEAN ALLIES HAVE HELD AT ONE

48
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:03,438
TIME OR ANOTHER.

49
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,606
THIS IS THE KIND OF NEW APPROACH

50
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:07,074
THAT WE ARE TAKING TO CREATE A

51
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:11,546
NEW SECURITY ARCHITECTURE IN THE

52
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:12,180
CONTEXT OF THE TOTALITY OF

53
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,816
IRAN'S THREATS.

54
00:01:14,816 --> 00:01:16,784
>> Bret: HERE IS SOMEONE WHO

55
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:20,021
NEGOTIATED BEFORE.

56
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:21,756
FORMER AMBASSADOR WENDY SHERMAN.

57
00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:23,257
>> I THINK POMPEO GAVE US A WISH

58
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:26,561
LIST TODAY AND IT'S A WISH LIST

59
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:27,328
PROBABLY EVERYBODY COULD AGREE

60
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:27,595
TO.

61
00:01:27,595 --> 00:01:29,430
YOU CAN GET IT ALL AT ONCE

62
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,165
BECAUSE THEN YOU ARE NEGOTIATING

63
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:32,366
AGAINST YOURSELF, AS ONE IS

64
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:34,802
TRADED OFF AGAINST THE OTHER.

65
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:36,404
>> Bret: YOUR RESPONSE.

66
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:38,706
>> I THINK THAT'S A VERY

67
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:39,440
DEFEATIST ATTITUDE, AND I THINK

68
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,377
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING

69
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:44,745
THE FULL RANGE OF IRANIAN

70
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:47,381
THREATS, WE DO NEED TO TAKE A

71
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:48,382
COPPERHEADS OF THEM VERY

72
00:01:48,382 --> 00:01:49,584
AMBITIOUS APPROACH.

73
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:51,052
THE SPEECH THAT SECRETARY POMPEO

74
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:53,120
DELIVERED TODAY DOES EXACTLY

75
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,388
THAT.

76
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:56,891
>> Bret: YEAH, ON THE TWEETS

77
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:58,759
COMING FROM THE IRANIANS, AT THE

78
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,027
END OF IT, AND REFERENCES THAT

79
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:03,764
IRAN IS STILL WORKING WITH

80
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:05,566
EUROPEAN PARTNERS TO CONTINUE

81
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,368
THE JCPOA, THE IRAN NUCLEAR

82
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:08,703
AGREEMENT THAT THE U.S. PULLED

83
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:09,036
OUT OF.

84
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:10,204
HOW MUCH LOVE OUR PROBLEM IS

85
00:02:10,204 --> 00:02:11,639
THAT GOING FORWARD AND HOW YOU

86
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,575
CALCULATE THAT?

87
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:16,077
>> I THINK THE UNITED STATES AND

88
00:02:16,077 --> 00:02:19,413
ITS EUROPEAN ALLIES SHARE A VERY

89
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:20,781
SIMILAR THREAT ASSESSMENT, AND

90
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:21,782
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM

91
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:23,985
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS TO

92
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:25,086
ADDRESS THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE

93
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:25,920
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

94
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,624
WE ALSO MADE PROGRESS ON ALL OF

95
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:31,359
THE MALIGNED ACTIVITIES THAT

96
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,160
FALL OUTSIDE OF THE NUCLEAR

97
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,995
PROGRAM.

98
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:36,631
AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT

99
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:38,966
FOUNDATIONAL WORK CAN BE BUILT

100
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:39,967
UPON.

101
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,169
BUT WE ARE NOT JUST LIMITING OUR

102
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:45,206
WORK TO THE EUROPEAN ALLIES.

103
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,641
SECRETARY POMPEO HAS INVITED

104
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:49,410
NATIONS FROM AROUND THE WORLD

105
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,178
THAT SHARE HIS CONCERNS TO JOIN

106
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:52,380
US IN THIS DIPLOMATIC EFFORT.

107
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,482
WE ARE LOOKING TO WORK WITH

108
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:56,284
NATIONS WHO ARE SICK AND TIRED

109
00:02:56,284 --> 00:02:59,620
OF IRAN'S QUEST FOR A NUCLEAR

110
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,957
WEAPON, WHO ARE TIRED OF IRAN'S

111
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:05,126
TERRORISM, FOR ITS FUNDING AND

112
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:06,027
FUELING SECTARIAN VIOLENCE, FOR

113
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:06,827
VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS.

114
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:09,597
WE HAVE SET FORTH A VERY

115
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:10,765
AMBITIOUS AGENDA THAT WE THINK

116
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:12,600
MUCH OF THE WORLD CAN GET

117
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:12,934
BEHIND.

118
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:13,601
>> Bret: I WANT TO TOUCH ON

119
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:16,203
TWO OTHER QUICK THINGS.

120
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:17,538
FINALLY ON IRAN, WHAT DO YOU SAY

121
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:18,773
TO CRITICS WHO LOOK AT THIS AND

122
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:20,608
SAY IT'S NOT ABOUT ANOTHER DEAL.

123
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:22,977
IT'S ABOUT REGIME CHANGE OR THE

124
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:23,678
POSSIBILITY OF REGIME CHANGE.

125
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:24,612
>> THE ONLY THING WE WOULD LIKE

126
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:26,948
TO SEE IS A CHANGE IN THE

127
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:30,017
BEHAVIOR OF THE IRANIAN REGIME.

128
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:31,385
NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES.

129
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:32,019
IT'S THE IRANIAN PEOPLE.

130
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:34,989
THE LONGEST SEVERING VICTIMS OF

131
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:35,656
THE IRANIAN REGIME OR THE

132
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:36,958
IRANIAN PEOPLE AND THEY ARE

133
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,826
LOOKING FOR A BETTER LIFE IN A

134
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:39,594
BETTER FUTURE.

135
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,628
THEY'VE HAD PROTESTS WHERE

136
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:41,228
THEY'VE EXPRESSED THIS.

137
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:46,167
THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BETTER

138
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:46,767
ECONOMICS.

139
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,436
THEY ARE TIRED OF THEIR

140
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:52,573
GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOREIGN WARS.

141
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:55,109
ROBBING FROM THE IRANIAN ECONOMY

142
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,577
TO SOW INSTABILITY ACROSS THE

143
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:57,211
MIDDLE EAST.

144
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:59,413
SO WE THINK WE HAVE SET FORTH

145
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:01,582
THE KIND OF POSITIVE VISION THAT

146
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:04,018
COULD ACTUALLY CHANGE RELATIONS

147
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:04,852
WITH IRAN.

148
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,287
THE SECRETARY PUT ON THE TABLE

149
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,589
THAT IF IRAN IS READY TO CHANGE

150
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:10,992
ITS BEHAVIOR, WE ARE READY TO

151
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:13,995
TALK ABOUT A RANGE OF BENEFITS,

152
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:16,029
INCLUDING FULL DIPLOMATIC TIES,

153
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,531
WELCOMING IRAN INTO THE GLOBAL

154
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:18,899
ECONOMY AND OTHER THINGS THAT

155
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,201
WOULD MATERIALLY IMPROVE THE

156
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,970
LIVES OF THE IRANIAN PEOPLE.

157
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,006
>> Bret: IT'S A SIMILAR

158
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:25,706
NEGOTIATION WITH NORTH KOREA.

159
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:26,774
AS WE SIT HERE TODAY, WHEN DO

160
00:04:26,774 --> 00:04:29,176
YOU THINK THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT

161
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:32,513
THE JUNE 12 SUMMIT MOVES FORWARD

162
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:34,181
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

163
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:34,582
KIM JONG UN?

164
00:04:34,582 --> 00:04:37,084
>> SECRETARY POMPEO HAS NOW MADE

165
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:38,586
TWO TRIPS TO NORTH KOREA TO TRY

166
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:41,022
TO SET THE TABLE FOR A

167
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:42,990
SUCCESSFUL MEETING IN SINGAPORE

168
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,225
ON JUNE 12.

169
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:45,593
THESE SORTS OF THINGS TAKE

170
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:47,595
TWISTS AND TURNS.

171
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:49,163
THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON WITH

172
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:49,563
NORTH KOREA.

173
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,599
SO ALL WE CAN DO IS TRY TO BE IN

174
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,934
A STATE OF READINESS AND TO DO

175
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:55,870
WHAT WE CAN SO THAT WE CAN HAVE

176
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,174
A VERY GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT, AS

177
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,575
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TALKED

178
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,911
ABOUT, VERY BRIGHT FUTURE FOR

179
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:06,180
THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE.

180
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,982
IF THE REGIME IS WILLING TO

181
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:08,416
DENUCLEARIZE.

182
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,618
>> Bret: LAST THING, FOR THE

183
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:11,719
PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL, PEOPLE

184
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,421
WHO ARE SKEPTICAL OF HOW THIS

185
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:15,289
HAS ALL COME TOGETHER, WHAT DO

186
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:17,591
YOU TELL THEM THAT THE

187
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:18,793
ADMINISTRATION, THE PRESIDENT IS

188
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:20,294
NOT GOING TO GIVE THE STORE AWAY
