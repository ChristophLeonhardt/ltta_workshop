the mile-long opera consists of 1,000 singers from all five boroughs of New York City and stretches through one of its newest and most popular parks called the High Line it's built on what was formerly an elevated railroad track the audience is invited to move between the groups of singers as you walk along the High Line the different stories you hear were inspired by interviews with New Yorkers from all walks of life there's no musical accompaniment just the sounds of the street I really wanted to make music out of all these a thousand people singing their own individual stories and they sing them very quietly and if you walk by them you hear this kind of haze of all these things kind of colliding with each other that sounds really beautiful and nice and at any moment when you are curious you can lean in close to one of the singers and hear what that individual story is in hear it a little better the performance is called the biography of seven o'clock focusing on a time of day associated with change changes everything seven o'clock is that time of the day that one equates with stability and the home coming home to dad humming coming home to a dinner and this is very far from people's lives today but it's also this fantastic moment in the day where day turns into night where people change activities they go from work to something else the city serves as both backdrop and protagonist by walking in a performance that reflects a changing society in a neighborhood that's literally been transformed by the park from a rundown industrial zone to a present-day magnet for tourism and investment and now a very unique setting for an urban opera Kristen salumi al Jazeera New York
