it's like the cover has been ripped off this man this whatever myth there was as you said earlier that he was a self-made man or that he was even a legitimate businessman he's gone forever you're listening to a man who's known Trump from the jump part of the deal writer Tony Schwartz weighing in on the bombshell by the paper he used to write for the New York Times exhaustive front-page investigation of the Trump family's tax schemes in fraud transferring hundreds of millions of dollars from Trump's dad to him today the White House says the story was false recycled and boring do you explain what is inaccurate about that story if there's anything that is actually accurate about it it's a totally false attack based on an old recycled news story I'm not gonna sit and go through every single line of a very boring 14,000 word story they won't go through every line but we will well not every line but let's look at the details which show why Trump may not want people reading every line because the story uses documentary evidence and over 200 tax returns - yes document how at every step of trumps career he was raking in not money from customers but money from his daddy and then proactively denying that he was doing it because he was obsessed with building this myth of the self-made billionaire take another article from the very same newspaper back in 1976 a times profile the cast Trump as a Robert Redford look-alike chauffeured around New York and his Cadillac and ability to make his own money moves it even quoted his father saying everything he touches turns to gold so that was the public pitch at the time but actually his father and Trump knew there was no great golden touch more of a son seeking handouts in fact within weeks of that very Times piece Fred Trump was arranging a four million dollar trust for his son while Trump kept bragging he built things on his own at an age of 37 I don't believe anyone's really ever you know more things than we have in terms of the business that I met but the times documents how at that very time in the 80s Trump was getting a salary from his dad about a quarter of a million in today's currency all the while saying it wasn't easy it's not been easy for me it has not been easy for me and you know I I started off in Brooklyn my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars the evidence shows that is a wild lie because Fred Trump actually led him over a hundred forty million in today's dollars and this is not some kind of starter money for when he was in his teens or 20s or maybe a few gifts as he was growing up what we find in the new piece is that while Trump was touting his riches on TV he was getting some of the biggest gifts ever from his dad like in 2004 when The Apprentice premiered you see both of those things you're looking at on the left and right or 2004 money money money but that was the year Trump got two hundred and thirty six million dollars in today's value from his father's estate Trump claimed of course he only got 1 million now he could have said 1,000 or nothing those numbers are off by so many magnitudes that maybe the round million just sounded like a more realistic lie and the White House is casting the facts in The Times story as some kind of political attack it's not it's reporting facts are facts and of course it was Republicans who raised similar alarms back before Trump had government power he has spent a career convincing Americans that he's something that he's not in exchange for their money he couldn't release past year's tax returns he can do it tomorrow he doesn't want to do it because presumably there's something in there not that is bad 200 million dollars if you had inherited 200 million dollars you know where da watches my back those are Republicans calling out Trump as a fraud the only factual difference between then and now is how much more evidence supports the claims you just heard to make including of course this massive report in The New York Times but all of this can also matter politically Trump didn't win the presidency by some big margin he got fewer votes and squeaked in through the electoral college while withholding as you heard the Republicans like Cruz stay there while withholding basic information about his taxes he knew the truth wasn't gonna help him in business or politics the truth being that he was a very lucky heir so he spent decades hiding his parents help and claiming he got rich himself and for people who follow the evidence that myth is over no one wants to say anymore that Trump has finally been caught that the Teflon has finally been scratched but I have to say the idea of who Donald Trump was that existed until today is gone forever now Trump can keep claiming that his career hasn't been as he put it easy or to paraphrase three 6 mafia that it's hard out here for a con man when trying to get this money for the rent for the Cadillacs and the gas money spent it's not been easy for me it has not been easy for me the New York Times report matters because it shows it has been easy for him it has been easy handouts and easy inheritance well into middle age and the big question now tonight is how these financial facts are catching up with Donald Trump hey I'm already Melvin from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our youtube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
