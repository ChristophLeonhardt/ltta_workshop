1
00:00:03,526 --> 00:00:03,859
SCOOP.

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:04,794
>> I WILL.

3
00:00:04,794 --> 00:00:06,195
>> THANK YOU AND GREAT TALKING

4
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:07,897
WITH YOU.

5
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:11,701
>> THANK YOU.

6
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:13,836
>> Sean: SEAN SPICER AUTHOR OF

7
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:16,372
THE GERALDO SHE.

8
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:18,207
GERALDO RIVERA AND SOUTH

9
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:20,176
CAROLINA GOVERNOR HENRY McMASTER

10
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:21,310
IS WITH US.

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,579
AND LET ME START WITH YOU.

12
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,548
THIS IS INTERESTING, IF YOU LOOK

13
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:27,416
IN THE CASE IN PARTICULAR, IT

14
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:30,119
WAS A FIRST OFFENSE, AND

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,921
LIFETIME SENTENCE FOR A WOMAN

16
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:33,989
WHO HAD A LOT OF PERMANENT

17
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,158
PROBLEM AND NEEDED MONEY AND GOT

18
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:38,394
INVOLVED IN DRUGS AND I THINK

19
00:00:38,394 --> 00:00:39,895
THAT THE CASE THAT KIM

20
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:41,397
KARDASHIAN PUSHED IS A POWERFUL

21
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:45,568
ONE AND WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION

22
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:45,868
TO.

23
00:00:45,868 --> 00:00:48,537
>> I THINK THERE IS IT NO DOUBT

24
00:00:48,537 --> 00:00:52,842
THAT KIM KARDASHIAN'S APPEARANCE

25
00:00:52,842 --> 00:00:53,743
WAS APPROPRIATE.

26
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:55,711
SURE SEAN SPICER COULD ANSWER

27
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:56,579
THAT BETTER.

28
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,714
SHE WAS BRINGING ATTENTION TO

29
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:00,082
A NECESSARY ISSUE AND ONE THAT

30
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:02,518
THE WHITE HOUSE IS GRAPPLING

31
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:04,486
WITH THANKS TO THE NEW

32
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:06,055
LEGISLATION ON SENTENCING

33
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:06,422
REFORM.

34
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:09,492
AND A LIFETIME SENTENCE AND NO

35
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:10,693
PAROLE, SHE DIDN'T MURDER

36
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:13,929
ANYBODY AND I THINK THAT KIM

37
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:15,898
KARDASHIAN'S VISIT TO THE WHITE

38
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:17,233
HOUSE WAS ABSOLUTELY

39
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:18,234
APPROPRIATE.

40
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:27,676
SAMANTHA BEE, YOU KNOW THE I

41
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:28,077
HYPOCRISY.

42
00:01:28,077 --> 00:01:30,179
WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS HAVE THE

43
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:32,114
THE VICTIMS OF THE INSULT TELL

44
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:34,016
US WHAT TO DO.

45
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:36,819
VALERIE JARRET RE71EDED

46
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:42,992
GRACIOUSLY TO ROSEANNE BARR AND

47
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:44,560
IVANKA WAS BEYOND GRACIOUS.

48
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,930
WHEN THEY BEG FORGIVENESS.

49
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,998
MAYBE WE GIVE IT.

50
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:51,167
THAT IS A CHRISTIAN VIEW.

51
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:54,837
>> Sean: WHAT IS YOUR TAKE.

52
00:01:54,837 --> 00:01:56,972
>> MY SHOCK FAKE.

53
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:59,475
THERE IS NOTHING IN BOTH OF

54
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,410
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS

55
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,778
NOTHING TO SHOCK ME.

56
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:06,015
JIM ACOSTA TO DECIDE WHAT IS

57
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:08,217
IMPORTANT ISSUE TO HEAR WHAT IS

58
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:11,353
DISCUSSED AT WHITE HOUSE?

59
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:14,657
AND BUT IT IS NOT UP TO THE

60
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:16,659
MEDIA NEVER MIND JIM ACOSTA TO

61
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:18,828
DECIDE WHAT IS A VALID ISSUE OR

62
00:02:18,828 --> 00:02:19,128
NOT.

63
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:20,896
IT IS UP TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE

64
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:23,132
UNITED STATES AND OTHER ELECTED

65
00:02:23,132 --> 00:02:25,234
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO DECIDE

66
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:26,836
WHAT IS SDRAESZED.

67
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:28,637
AND EVERY AMERICAN HAS THE RIGHT

68
00:02:28,637 --> 00:02:30,339
TO ADVOCATE GOVERNMENT TO

69
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:32,208
SUPPORT THEM ONE WAY OR THE

70
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:32,541
OTHER.

71
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,977
ON THE OTHER ONE SAMANTHA BEE, I

72
00:02:34,977 --> 00:02:36,645
BELIEVE, I MADE A LOT OF

73
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:38,113
MISTAKES IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT

74
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:42,384
I ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS FOR AND

75
00:02:42,384 --> 00:02:44,086
PEOPLE WERE VERY GRACIOUS TO ME.

76
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:46,922
>> YOU DID NOT MAKE THAT MANY

77
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:47,756
MISTAKES.

78
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:49,925
>> THANK YOU, BUT MY POINT IS

79
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:50,259
THIS.

80
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:52,228
WHEN PEOPLE SCREW UP AND

81
00:02:52,228 --> 00:02:54,029
APOLOGIZE GIVE THEM FORGIVENESS.

82
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:56,899
BULLPEN THE DOUBLE STANDARD THAT

83
00:02:56,899 --> 00:03:01,070
EXISTS WHETHER SAMANTHA BEE OR

84
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,238
JOY REED.

85
00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:05,140
AND WHEN THEY MAKE A MISTAKE,

86
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,377
THE LEFT ABSOLVES THEM AND

87
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:10,045
EXCUSES AND EXPLAINS THEY ARE

88
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:13,382
NOT THAT BAD AND NO

89
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:14,650
CONSEQUENCES.

90
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,185
IVANKA IS SO GRACEFUL ABOUT

91
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:16,518
THIS.

92
00:03:16,518 --> 00:03:18,888
THIS IS IT NOT THE FIRST TIME.

93
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:21,056
REMEMBER THE FORMER POLITICO

94
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:23,959
REPORTER IN THE ATLANTIC SAID

95
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,094
A SIMILAR THING.

96
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:26,929
WHAT WAS THE THING?

97
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:27,796
SHE DIDN'T MEAN?

98
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:28,063
?

99
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:30,766
THE ATTACKS BY THE JOURNALIST

100
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,936
AND PEOPLE ON THE LEFT GET

101
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:37,206
EXCUSED AND WASHED AWAY EVERY

102
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:37,806
TIME.

103
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:39,642
>> Sean: GOOD LUCK FOR YOUR RUN

104
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:41,477
FOR GOVERNOR IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

105
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:42,845
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL STATE AND I

106
00:03:42,845 --> 00:03:44,880
HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS DOWN

107
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,214
THERE.

108
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:46,916
AND I LOOK AT THIS.

109
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,386
I AM LIKE THIS IS NOW AN

110
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:50,819
ENVIRONMENT.

111
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,390
I READ EVERYBODY'S APOLOGIYS.

112
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,458
AND ROSEANNE APOLOGIZED AGAIN

113
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,928
AND AGAIN AND I SENSE THAT THERE

114
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:01,964
IS REAL SINCERITY.

115
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:03,599
2:45 A.M. TWEET AND NOT A GOOD

116
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,102
THING AND I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS

117
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:10,239
GERALDO KNOWS A THING ABOUT

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:10,773
THAT.

119
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:12,041
>>IN KNOW VERY WELL.

120
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,810
NO TWEETING AFTER MIDNIGHT.

121
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,579
>> Sean: EVERYBODY WANTS TO

122
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,148
SILENCE VOICES THEY NEVER AGREE

123
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:19,714
WITH.

124
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:22,017
I NEVER CALLED FOR CANCELLING OF

125
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:26,221
A SHOW AND FIRING OF A HOST AND

126
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:29,124
BILL MAR WANT AND SEAN HANNITY

127
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:31,226
AND RUSH LIMBAUGH.

128
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:33,329
WE SAID DON'T FIRE THEM.

129
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:36,098
>> THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST GONE

130
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:37,766
CRAZY.

131
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:39,935
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IT ENOMMOUSLY

132
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:41,437
POP PROSPECT HERE.

133
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:43,806
IF HE RUN TODAY HE WOULD GET

134
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:46,208
MORE VOTES AND HAD HIS TWEET WAS

135
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:46,608
RIGHT.

136
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,544
HE IS SAYING WHAT EVERYBODY IN

137
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:51,447
SOUTH CAROLINA IS THINKING.

138
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:52,514
HE'S 100 PERCENT RIGHT.

139
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:53,615
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO

140
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:56,585
THE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT.

141
00:04:56,585 --> 00:05:00,289
I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS HATRED OF

142
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:02,992
THE PRESIDENT OR WHAT HE STANDS

143
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:03,292
FOR.

144
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:05,294
THEY ARE MAKING FOOMS OF

145
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:05,728
THEMSELVES.

146
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:07,830
THEY ARE SO DEEP IN THE TANK

147
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,099
THEY DON'T REALIZE IT AND SHOOT.

148
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:12,101
THEY WILL APOLOGIZE UNTIL THE

149
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,103
NEXT TIME AND THEN THE NEXT TIME

150
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:16,538
AND I THINK PEOPLE HAVE JUST HAD

151
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:17,973
ENOUGH OF IT.

152
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:22,244
>> Sean: GERALDO, AS MUCH AS I

153
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:24,847
WOULD LIKE TO MAKE EVERYBODY TO

154
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:27,783
WATCHMENT SHOW,IN HAVE TO HAVE

155
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:30,552
THEM INVIT ME IN THIS HOME AND

156
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:31,920
THAT'S HOW YOU GAIN THE

157
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,124
AUDIENCE.  AND THE AMERICAN

158
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:36,325
PEOPLE ARE SMART.

159
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:38,827
WE FEEL WE HAVE TO SILENCE.

160
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:41,163
>> IN THAT REGARD, REFERENCING

161
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:42,731
SOMETHING IN THE BEGINNING.

162
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:44,366
PROGRAM THIS EVENING ABOUT THE

163
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:48,270
DEEP STATE COMING FOR YOU.

164
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:48,704
ME.

165
00:05:48,704 --> 00:05:50,706
I WILL BE THERE FIGHTING OFF

166
00:05:50,706 --> 00:05:51,607
THESE PEOPLE.

167
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:54,143
>> Sean: I HAVE GERALDO IN MY

168
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:55,677
BUNKER, I AM SAFE.

169
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:59,681
>> I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

170
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:02,451
LEVEL OF CIVILITY?

171
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,586
IT IS LOW DOWN AND DIRTY NOW.

172
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:07,022
AND THE CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR

173
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:08,590
IN THE GREAT STATE OF SOUTH

174
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,659
CAROLINA ALLUDED TO IT.

175
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:12,861
THERE IS REALLY, THE COUNTRY IS

176
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,464
SO DWIELDED AND THE PEOPLE WHO

177
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:17,900
HATE THE PRESIDENT HATE HIM WITH

178
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,201
SUCH VE HEMINENCE.

179
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:24,673
AND WHERE DO THEY GET THIS>>

180
00:06:24,673 --> 00:06:26,975
Sean: YOU WANT HIM SUCCEED.

181
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:30,279
IF HE'S SUCCESSFUL WITH THE

182
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:30,646
ECONOMY.

183
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:33,215
LOOK AT NORTH KOREA AND KEEPING

184
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,452
HIS PROMISE AND BECOMING ENERGY

185
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:37,886
INDEPENDENT AND THAT DACKS CUT.

186
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:41,657
THAT IS BAD NEWS FOR DEMOCRATS

187
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:44,993
FOR THEM TO WIN HE HAS TO FALL.

188
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:47,729
>> THAT IS MELANCOLLIE THAT THEY

189
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:49,264
ROOT AGAINST THEIR OWN COUNTRY

190
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:52,134
FOR PARTISAN PERSON.

191
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:53,202
HAWN>> Sean: LAST WORD.

192
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:55,704
>> ONE THING ABOUT THE SAMANTHA

193
00:06:55,704 --> 00:06:58,140
BEE IS IT WAS PRETAPED AND THEY

194
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,309
SCRIPTED IT AND STILL WENT AHEAD

195
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:01,176
OF IT.

196
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:03,679
THAT IS VASTLY MAKING A STEPPING

197
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,614
IN IT WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT.

198
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:07,583
AND I REALLY THINK THE CASE IS

199
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,218
DIFFERENT THAN A LOT OF THE

200
00:07:09,218 --> 00:00:00,000
OTHER ONES.
