Pete Williams more of an update Pete Andrea we're told now is that the gunman in custody is a 17 year old a 17 year old male and for that reason we're not probably going to hear from at least federal sources of his age because for federal law enforcement purposes a juvenile is anyone under the age of 18 so there's a strict policy among federal law enforcement officials that they can't release the name of a juvenile so it it I think some things are starting to be pretty clear here now one is that it was a current student a 17 year old male secondly somehow two people were involved in this it's it's still not clear to us what the nature of the second person's involvement was and the third thing that's becoming clearer now is that explosive devices were also involved in this in this attack on this school where they were placed how many of them we don't know we're told it's more than one but what their role is what they were supposed to do I don't know we I should emphasize here that we've heard nothing to indicate that explosive devices detonated at any point all the injuries and fatalities that we know of are from gunshot wounds so what was the plan here was it just to cause additional chaos to go after first responders to draw people with the shooting toward where the explosive devices were way too soon to say any of that yet but I think I think the picture here is becoming a little clearer on the nature of this obviously well-planned attack given the fact that explosive devices were used that tells you two things the one is that somebody had to make these devices in advance and then place them in advance before carrying out the shooting you said that there were two people involved was there one shooter or two shooters don't know the answer to that I think I think I'm just assuming here from everything we've heard that there's only one gunman and what the second person's involvement is I just don't know I mean just sheer speculation here it could be someone who set the fire alarm off to draw people out it could be somebody who helped place the explosive it could be somebody who helped planned it we just don't know the nature of that second person's involvement but but now we've been told from so many law enforcement officials that two people were involved and what the nature of the second person's involvement is we don't know and Pete just to recap are both of these people allegedly involved in custody yes and are both underage or do we only know the age of one I only know that I only I'm only relatively certain of the age of the gunman in that 17 I don't know the age of the other of the other and we had earlier been hearing from our local correspondent from KPRC that at least three people are at utmb in Galveston that is about 20 miles away one a middle-aged man is in surgery critically shot in the chest a woman was in good condition shot in the leg a male under the age of 18 also shot in the leg and is in good condition two were brought by ambulance one was brought by life flight so helicopter din and that presumably is the man who's the middle-aged man in critical condition who was shot in the chest and he's in surgery and we need updates on the other victims and any others who were both wounded and also the number of casualties not yet determined by sheriff can-can solace they're two different counties law enforcement involved hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
