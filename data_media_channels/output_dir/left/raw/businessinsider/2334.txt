1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,700
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple making the same mistake all</font>

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,500
over again gene that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question I</font>

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,300
watched the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost died in the</font>

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,770
late 90s because it was trying to

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,869
control everything seems like Google's

6
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,789
taking the same tack with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android that</font>

7
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,650
Microsoft took with Windows working with

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,570
lots of hardware providers but you're

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">not concerned about it no or not and the</font>

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,439
reasons that ultimately on these<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices</font>

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,200
people want an application it's easy to

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,030
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that's one of the big</font>

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,739
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this environment that</font>

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,149
they've created is just a simple

15
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,370
easy-to-use environment and I think that

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,230
ultimately that's the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple's</font>

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,700
taking the right strategy by really

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,860
locking down these apps but<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't that</font>

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,180
what it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with the Mac as well</font>

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,969
Mac was incredibly easy to use much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">so beloved by people and yet still it</font>

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,090
became<font color="#E5E5E5"> this niche business Microsoft IBM</font>

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,800
and all the hardware providers went into

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,690
the corporation is they won Matt market

25
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,609
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case no chance of that happening</font>

26
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,049
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't think so and the reason</font>

27
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,570
ultimately is that the app world is much

28
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,670
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the application world and</font>

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,650
ultimately people are looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

30
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,460
certain feature and at 110,000 apps you

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,140
know that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> satisfies the demand</font>

32
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,299
that people have for getting function

33
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,130
out of these phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

34
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,540
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look back and the software world</font>

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,890
the problem was there wasn't a lot of

36
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,619
software applications for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac but in</font>

37
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,630
this case we have just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> plethora of</font>

38
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">apps that are available for the iPhone</font>

39
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,920
at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day it's this is that</font>

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,869
the app developers want to build on a

41
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,850
platform that's widely distributed and

42
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,890
right now the iphone platforms most

43
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,680
widely distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> platforms so</font>

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,720
effectively they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in to be</font>

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,970
a closed system but yet have a wide

46
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,500
adoption so you think they can maintain

47
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,360
that leader the early leads

48
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,369
extraordinary obviously yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

49
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,170
all comes down to that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just you</font>

50
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,899
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that 110,000 apps that they have</font>

51
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">compared that to 20,000 on Android one</font>

52
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,729
of the keys that if you really look and

53
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,530
see what Apple strategy is here by

54
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,960
locking the phone down keeping

55
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,170
essentially flash off of the phone that

56
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,860
enables keeps applications to be

57
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,870
developed in flash and being ported to

58
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,650
other apps

59
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,269
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple obviously understands the</font>

60
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,400
power of what these apps are doing I

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,500
think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important part here is</font>

62
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they have plenty of apps right now</font>

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,220
and that just continues to grow so

64
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,349
looking ahead three to five years what's

65
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:27,360
your best guess as to what say the US

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,310
smartphone market looks like where is

67
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,859
rim where's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google where's Apple well I</font>

68
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,959
don't cover rim so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably shouldn't</font>

69
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,790
talk as much about that but I think

70
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimately Apple is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

71
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:40,049
the the leaders if not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the leader and if</font>

72
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:41,609
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about about eighteen percent</font>

73
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:44,370
right now of phones worldwide talk about

74
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,980
the worldwide our smartphones and I

75
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,510
think that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you fast forward a few</font>

76
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,579
years from now you can see Apple having

77
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,290
forty fifty percent share within the

78
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,109
smartphone market I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what I think</font>

79
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,690
in it within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> global market</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

80
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,760
closer to thirty forty percent I can

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,170
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about how that happens</font>

82
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,049
but also in terms of the second platform

83
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,150
is probably Android and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third is</font>

84
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,819
probably rim so rim gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lift upward</font>

85
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,530
now what about nokia which right out

86
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,269
there a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of years ago was the</font>

87
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,340
complete elephant in the room nokia is

88
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,980
struggling<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the at</font>

89
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,209
the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't had</font>

90
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,459
the same innovation clearly that Google

91
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,680
and Apple has had great thanks gene

92
00:03:22,680 --> 00:00:00,000
thank you
