1
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,655
“Hold the elevator.”

2
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:15,485
“Hello.”

3
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:16,225
“Hi.”

4
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:17,283
“Hello.”

5
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:22,041
“What’s going on?”

6
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:38,836
“Good morning, everyone.”

7
00:00:53,998 --> 00:01:01,488
“Tell the guards to open up the gate.”

8
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:10,770
“For the first time in forever —”

9
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,940
“The gate —

10
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,230
If you start it
on the gate —”

11
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,720
“O.K., great.”

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,990
“It feels like your step back

13
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,330
actually makes those 
gates open.”

14
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,050
“Amazing.”

15
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,050
“If we wait, somehow they’re running —

16
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,125
Then you feel like, it’s an adjustment,

17
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,935
as opposed to — yeah yeah.”

18
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,450
“— the first time.”

19
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,575
“For the first time in forever...”

20
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,000
“Cheeseburger in Paradise.”

21
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,360
“Money makes the man.”

22
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,780
“Money makes the man.”

23
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,030
“You’ve got a better plan.”

24
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,860
“Money makes the man.”

25
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:28,405
“Money makes the man.”

26
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,580
“Money makes the man.”

27
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,255
“Can he say other than —”

28
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,415
“Going up.”

29
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:20,487
“Uh —”

30
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,210
“And you blow into it here,
right?”

31
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,210
“I have —”

32
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,230
“’cause that’s supposed to be cut off.”

33
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,000
“Oh yeah, that is —”

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,430
“Uh —”

35
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:29,845
“It’s a right-handed one.”

36
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:30,980
“It’s a right-handed one!”

37
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,040
“That’s the problem.”

38
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,190
“Some people claim that there’s a —

39
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,380
one, two, three, one, two, three

40
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,740
blame, boom, boom, but I know —”

41
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:52,000
“Some people claim that
there’s a woman to blame.”

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,796
“Thank you!”

43
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:39,463
“Awesome, guys.”

44
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:40,679
“Get that out of here.”

45
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:43,831
“Oh my god.”

46
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,470
“There’s nothin’ like summer in the city

47
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,740
Someone in a rush next to 
someone lookin’ pretty

48
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,950
Excuse me, miss, I know it’s not funny

49
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,260
But your perfume smells like 
your daddy’s got money

50
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,830
Why you slummin’ in the city 
in your fancy heels

51
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,120
You searchin’ for an urchin 
who can give you ideals?”

52
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,520
“Burr, you disgust me.”

53
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,230
“Ahh, so you’ve discussed me

54
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,330
I’m a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!”

55
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,850
“Look around, look around at how
lucky we are to be alive right now!”

56
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,510
“Look around, look around at how
lucky we are to be alive right now!”

57
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,510
“History is happening in Manhattan
and we just happen to be —

58
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,880
In the greatest city in the world!”

59
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,020
“In the greatest city in the world!”

60
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:42,328
“Angelica.”

61
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:43,868
“Eliza.”

62
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:45,048
“And Peggy.”

63
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:46,618
“The Schuyler sisters!”

64
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:47,629
“Work. Work.”

65
00:05:47,629 --> 00:00:00,000
“We’re looking for a mind —”
