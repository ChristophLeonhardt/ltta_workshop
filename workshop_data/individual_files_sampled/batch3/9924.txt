♪ ♪ WE REALLY NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FBI DURING COMEY YEARS. JAMES COMEY SAID ANDREW MCCABE STOOD TALL, WAS A MODEL LEADER, NOW HE WANTS IMMUNITY BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE IS IN JEOPARDY WITH HIS CONDUCT OVER THIS INVESTIGATION. GIVING MR. McCABE COVER THREE IMMUNITY WOULD BE A MISTAKE. I WOULD NOT GIVE HIM IMMUNITY. IF HE'S GOING TO PLEAD THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, THEN HE SHOULD PLEAD THE FIFTH. IT'S UNHEARD OF FOR THE NUMBER TWO PERSON IN THE FBI SAYING, YOU WANT ME TO TESTIFY? GIVE ME IMMUNITY. Shannon: JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR AT NATIONAL REVIEW. SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF AT USA TODAY "USA TODAY." BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE "WASHINGTON EXAMINER." WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT McCABE AND IMMUNITY. IT COMES AHEAD OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORTS. ARE THEY CONNECTED? I'M SURE THEY ARE CONNECTED. HOW AND IN WHAT WAY REMAINS TO BE SEEN. I PERSONALLY AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF GETTING ALL THE INFORMATION OUT HERE, WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT COMEY, ALL OF IT. I AM NOT SURE IT TRACKS TO SAY WE HAVE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, AS SENATOR CORNYN WAS SAYING NO WAY SHOULD WE GIVE THIS GUY IMMUNITY. IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU GET THE INFORMATION OUT OF HIM, THE ARGUMENT THEY GO THE OTHER WAY. IT SEEMS TO ME THERE IS AN INTEREST IN THE OPTICS WHICH ARE VERY BAD FOR McCABE, VERY BAD FOR COMEY TO HAVE THE NUMBER TWO GUY AT THE FBI PLEADING THE FIFTH. IF WE WANT TO GET THE INFORMATION, I AM AGNOSTIC. IF HE DESERVES TO GO TO JAIL, I WANT HIM TO GO TO JAIL. IF HE DOESN'T DESERVE IT, I DON'T BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED THE INFORMATION. Shannon: U.S. ATTORNEY LOOKING INTO WHAT WAS FOUND BIASED SEPARATE REPORT, WHETHER THERE WILL BE CRIMINAL LIABILITY. SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY SAID BEFORE EVEN BEGINNING TO CONSIDER WHETHER TO INITIATE THE PROCESS OF IMMUNITY, THE COMMITTEE WOULD NEED TO KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT THE ANTICIPATED SCOPE, NATURE AND EXTENT OF YOUR TESTIMONY. SUSAN, SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN. IT'S HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO TAKE THE FIFTH OR DEMAND IMMUNITY IF THEY EXPECT HIM TO TESTIFY. BUT I AGREE THAT OPTICS IS THE WORD OF THE DAY. THE NUMBER TWO GUY AT THE FBI, YOU DON'T EXPECT TO FIND HIM IN THAT SITUATION BUT HE MUST BE SURPRISED TO FIND HIMSELF IN THIS SITUATION AFTER A CAREER IN THE FBI. TWO DAYS AWAY FROM RETIRING AND HE GETS CAUGHT INTO THIS CONTINUING CONTROVERSY OVER THE CLINTON EMAILS AND OVER THE ALLEGATIONS THAT HE LEAKED INFORMATION TO "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" AND THEN MISLED INVESTIGATORS ABOUT IT. IT'S GOT TO BE A SHOCKING THING FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY. Shannon: WHAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND IN THE REPORT WAS THERE WAS SOMETHING LESS THAN FULLY HONEST AND A NUMBER OF THESE. HE AND COMEY WERE AT ODDS ABOUT WHO WAS RIGHT AND WHAT INFORMATION THEY SHARED. COMEY PRAISED HIM PUBLICLY BUT NOW SHOULD COMEY BE WORRIED ABOUT McCABE MAY SAY THAT COULD INFLUENCE OR HURT HIM? THERE IS MORE THAT COMEY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE IMMUNITY REQUEST IN THE IG REPORT IS BECAUSE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS SCHEDULED A HEARING TO DISCUSS THE IG REPORT ONCE IT'S MADE PUBLIC. THEY HAD SCHEDULED ONE FOR JUNE 5. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. THEY SCHEDULED THE NEXT ONE FOR NEXT MONDAY, JUNE 11. LOOKS LIKE THAT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN BUT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FAIRLY SOON. THEY WANTED McCABE TO TESTIFY. NOW HE IS ASKED FOR IMMUNITY, AND THERE'S MORE THAN JUST THE COMEY VERSUS McCABE, I LEAKED BUT YOU TOLD ME I COULD. NO, I DIDN'T. THERE IS MORE THAN THAT. THERE'S TALK ABOUT, INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN McCABE TOOK A LONG TIME TO RECUSE HIMSELF AFTER HIS WIFE GOT A LOT OF POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS KIND OF LINKED TO THE CLINTONS. McCABE WAS INVOLVED IN EVERY OTHER DECISION IN THIS CLINTON THING. IT'S NOT JUST COMEY VERSUS McCABE. Shannon: ANOTHER NAME IN THE MIX IS PETER STRZOK. HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HE IS WRINGING HIS HANDS AND WAITING FOR THE REPORT. HE WAS AN FBI AGENT WORKING ON THIS CASE AND BECAUSE OF THESE VERY THESE TEXTS HE SENT TO HIS GIRLFRIEND DENOUNCING PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE'S SEEN AS TAINTING THE EFFORTS HE WAS DOING WHEN HE WAS WORKING FOR THE FBI. THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FAIR BUT HE'S AN INFLAMMATORY NAME WHEN YOU SEE IN THINGS LIKE THE ONE CONTROVERSY OF THE DAY, THE FACT THAT GSA TURNED OVER A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM THE TRANSITION TEAM TO MUELLER WITHOUT A SUBPOENA, WITHOUT GOING BACK TO THE TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM TO GET PERMISSION. STRZOK WAS PART OF THAT. IT'S AS THOUGH WE ARE IN SUCH A WORLD OF INVESTIGATION THAT THERE IS NO ELEMENT THAT DOES NOT GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS. Shannon: ALSO CONGRESS HAS BEEN VERY BUSY WITH INVESTIGATIONS BUT NOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE BUSY, AT LEAST THE SENATE SIDE, IN AUGUST THANKS TO SENATE LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL SAY THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN SESSION. HERE'S THE TOP REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT OF THE SENATE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT BE DOING. WHY DON'T WE GET SOMETHING DONE ON THE ISSUE THAT NUMEROUS POLLS SAY IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY OF AMERICANS? HEALTH CARE. WE DEMOCRATS, OUR ENTIRE CAUCUS, BELIEVES THIS PREVIOUSLY ON SCHEDULED SESSION TIME CAN BE PUT TO GOOD USE. WE NEED TO CONFIRM MORE OF THE PRESIDENTS TEAM AND JUDICIAL NOMINEES. WE NEED TO TAKE UP A REGULAR APPROPRIATION BILLS. WE NEED TO TACKLE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES LIKE THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, THE FARM BILL, DEFENSE BILL. MANY OTHERS. Shannon: JONAH, BOTH SIDES HAVE LAID OUT A PRETTY AMBITIOUS SCHEDULE. DOES ANY OF THAT GET DONE? THERE ARE CONSPIRACY THEORIES IS TOO STRONG A BOARD BUT THERE ARE THEORIES THAT WHAT McCONNELL IS TRYING TO DO IS PULL BACK DEMOCRATS FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL MAKE THEM BE STUCK HERE. THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO SAY NO, THIS IS REALLY ABOUT PUTTING A GUN TO THE DEMOCRATS' HEADS SO HE CAN CRAM MORE JUDGES THROUGH. I DON'T SEE WHY WE HAVE TO FIT ONE OF THOSE. BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE LIKE THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF THE NEW DEAL COMING OUT IN D.C. IN AUGUST. Shannon: WE SAW THE FIRST LADY TODAY. THE PRESIDENT TWEETED THIS: "THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA HAS BEEN SO UNFAIR, AND VICIOUS, TO MY WIFE AND OUR GREAT FIRST LADY, MELANIA. DURING HER RECOVERY FROM SURGERY THEY REPORTED EVERYTHING FROM NEAR DEATH, TO FACELIFT, TO LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE. AND ME FOR NEW YORK OR VIRGINIA, TO ABUSE. ALL FAKE, SHE IS DOING REALLY WELL!" SUSAN, THERE'S BEEN A TON OF SPECULATION. TODAY WE SAW HER AND SHE DID LOOK WELL. A WORD OF MY HUSBAND IS WATCHING, IF YOU ARE GOING TO DENY SOMETHING, DO NOT DENY I HAD A FACE-LIFT. NOT THE APPROACH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. I AM SORT OF IN THE LEAVE MELANIA TRUMP ALONE CAMP. SHE DIDN'T RUN FOR OFFICE. SHE'S NOT WEIGHING IN ON POLICY. I THINK IF SHE THIS GOT STARTED BECAUSE SHE WAS KIND OF OUT OF SIGHT FOR THREE WEEKS BUT IF SHE WANTS TO STAY OUT OF
