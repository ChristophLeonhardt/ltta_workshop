1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:15,929
okay all right
there it is the president saying he has

2
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,350
made a decision about whether to pull
out of the Iran deal has not revealed

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,619
that he said to let us know when he
wants to joining us now to discuss that

4
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,220
and a lot more as the president's
national security adviser HR McMaster

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,490
sir pleasure to have you on the show
Thanks thank you for your service to the

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,230
country ultra privilege so do you
Rex Ellison Secretary of State was

7
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,430
surprised to hear that the president
said that he had made a decision did you

8
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,000
know that the president had made a
decision sure we've all been involved in

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,620
lengthy discussions not just about the
Iran deal but really what to do about

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,629
Iran's destabilizing behavior broadly
you know the the the the potential of a

11
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,070
nuclear program the need to block all
paths to a nuclear weapon for Iran but

12
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,670
their ballistic missile program things
not covered under this incomplete deal

13
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,600
and really what they've done to
perpetuate violence across the Middle

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,070
East with support for terrorist
organizations proxy forces propping up

15
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,020
this murderous Assad regime you know
causing problems and enmeshing people in

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,509
conflict in in Yemen's subverting Iraq
and so we've taken a holistic look at

17
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,380
this I think what's different about the
president's approach is that he didn't

18
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,420
look just at the Iran deal he placed his
decision on there and deal in broad

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,920
context of how we protect American
citizens American interests how we

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,210
protect our allies and partners from
Iran's broad range of destabilizing

21
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,200
behavior understood two questions one
what is the decision do you know I know

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,130
what the decision is but but but when
when the president reveals that when he

23
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,470
talks about it he'll place it in context
of the broader approach to Iran and what

24
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,840
we have to do as a nation to protect our
people but what we have to do with our

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,360
with our allies and partners to really
to really prevent Iran from continuing

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,890
this buried to stabilizing behavior the
threat to Israel the the the seeding the

27
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,179
the flow of these of these very
destructive weapons through this

28
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,800
clandestine network they've set up you
know from from you know Gaza to Levin

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,830
to Syria to to Yemen and understood in
Iraq dangling it the way the President

30
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,900
did is good showmanship perhaps but it
can also be destabilizing you had

31
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,240
rouhani from Iran come out and say this
deal is non-negotiable you had Khomeini

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,290
understood he's a religious leader he is
prone more towards extreme views he says

33
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,140
that the president is speaking at a
desperation and anger the central focus

34
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,500
is I hear everything you said about what
Iran is doing and we've heard it from

35
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,340
others as well that is not what this
deal was about as you well know this was

36
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,060
about controlling containing as best you
can

37
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,250
looking at the missile program the
nuclear development program why mess

38
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,470
with that deal in the interest of these
outside issues well I think the main

39
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,490
reason is the deal is fundamentally
flawed I mean it as the president said

40
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,630
he called the worst deal of all time it
gave the Iranian regime all the benefits

41
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,740
up front and then the incompleteness of
the deal the flaws of the deal the

42
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,580
sunset clause that could really give
this regime who's not trustworthy

43
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,500
obviously cover to advance a nuclear
program and then have this threshold

44
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,570
capability but you had the 60 lb
missiles which lie outside the

45
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,709
understood Ram but you have a visit that
issue here and you have your six nation

46
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,640
allies okay including the US this was
the best deal they thought they could

47
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,080
get by most accounts this has stopped
slowed and somehow in some way

48
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,080
positively influenced their development
capabilities and we haven't heard you

49
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,550
guys Rex Tillerson or others question
that reality but if this was the best

50
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,480
deal they thought they could get and you
have outside concerns why not deal with

51
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,080
those separately cut a different deal
about what Iran is doing elsewhere

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,560
assuming you have leverage but if you
mess with this you may destabilize the

53
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,550
entire situation according to the
Iranians well what's happened is this

54
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,239
deal has had the exact opposite in terms
of what the expectations were the effect

55
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,650
of that deal and Iran is continuing
missile development missile development

56
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,940
that could be paired with the nuclear
program later the the regime has not

57
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,358
just walked up the line but crossed the
line you know spinning too many

58
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,490
centrifuges too much heavy water and so
while the IAEA the the monitoring body

59
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,650
has
has called them out on it and they've

60
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,240
corrected some of this how do you trust
this regime to do it so much more

61
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,750
rigorous enforcement is needed the need
to address this fundamental flaw of the

62
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,490
sunset clause the need to address other
capabilities that could then threaten

63
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:48,750
the world from this autocratic
theocratic regime in in Iran and so such

64
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,690
as the missile program so these are the
things that we have to work on together

65
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,509
but in the context of an overall Iran
strategy because Iran is is

66
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:59,340
destabilizing
not just the Middle East but poses a

67
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,380
broader threat Iran is is perpetuating
this humanitarian and political crisis

68
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,009
in the Middle East I don't think the
argument is so much about what Iran does

69
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:11,810
that as negative it's about how to
approach it because in this move

70
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,050
potentially you destabilize a second
situation which is North Korea because

71
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,259
arguably what we've been hearing from
most of you guys when the president

72
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,340
isn't being more inflammatory with his
rhetoric is we'll get them to the table

73
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,139
we'll make a deal why would North Korea
make a deal with people who are backing

74
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,949
out of a deal with somebody else
involving nuclear capabilities doesn't

75
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,550
it compromise your efforts there no I
don't I don't think so at all in fact I

76
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,520
think it's strengthens our efforts with
North Korea cause North Korea knows this

77
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,389
president is not going to repeat the
failed strategies of past but help us

78
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,069
understand how North Korea seen you back
out of a deal with six nations involved

79
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:51,539
helps well what's happened is North
Korea has just walked into deals with

80
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,159
the North Korean regime which it then
breaks immediately so the pattern in the

81
00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:01,620
past with North Korea was to engage in
long drawn-out talks lock-in wherever

82
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,440
they had gotten with their missile
program their nuclear program is a new

83
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,550
normal and then a week deals developed
which then Iran immediately break I mean

84
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,630
I'm sorry North Korea immediately breaks
so we're out of we're out of time now on

85
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,750
North Korea so we can't take that
approach anymore and what the

86
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,580
president's been able to do is is
marshal the the broad community of

87
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,330
nations nations who recognize that we
must work together

88
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,680
urgently on this problem and so you've
seen the very strong sanctions - 15 -

89
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,909
nothing votes in the Security Council
now the move to enforce those sanctions

90
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:36,570
and do more the president will make an
important announcement today about the

91
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,830
continuation of our efforts to resolve
this problem with North Korea

92
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,850
short of war and he'll make that
announcement as he meets with our very

93
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,310
close allies South Korea and Japan lady
one of the authors of rocket man as a

94
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,090
way to describe Kim jong-un do you think
that kind of rhetoric helps well it's

95
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,390
it's an accurate term I mean this is
someone who was compromised everything

96
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:03,060
for his nation in the pursuit of this
capabilities he is he is disadvantaging

97
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,960
his own people every day by investing is
what the president said a suicide

98
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,060
mission
this is not going to keep his people

99
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,920
safer it puts them on a path to
devastation understood what does the

100
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,560
words matter
edik t' apply here that you know you

101
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,600
talk to a hothead who's very unstable in
an inflammatory way is that helpful well

102
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,510
it got everybody's attention right and
we need to get everybody's attention we

103
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,590
cannot take the same approach we've been
taking on North Korea it is really

104
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,670
really an urgent problem though so
there's talk and then there's action you

105
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:38,190
have been talking about something called
preventative military action okay which

106
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,600
is different than pre-emptive and this
isn't you know I'm not trying to get big

107
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,710
brain on this it matters to the American
people yes pre-emptive is who they're

108
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,620
getting ready to do something to us and
we can see it we have to do something

109
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,620
first recognized an international law as
a reasonable potential basis for act

110
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,570
preventive is not you've been using the
word preventative what do you mean by

111
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,140
that what would you do with military
force well preventive means that you

112
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,520
think that the threat is so grave and it
is so imminent that you have to act to

113
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,140
prevent that threat to the American
people that's priam or Alice know

114
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,760
pre-emptive is if you see that an
imminent threat so for example the

115
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,180
lining up of missiles that could be
tarred and this is this is a leader who

116
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,860
said he is and his people have said he
is going to target the u.s. understood

117
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,270
us the great threat to our great ally
Japan and obviously South Korea which

118
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,890
lives really under the gun of this
regime and about 50,000 US servicemen

119
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,010
and women and their families right and
and so what we owe the president is

120
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,729
options what we have to do is help
define with our great intelligence

121
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,660
community along with our South Korean
allies with our Japanese allies to

122
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,230
define these decision points because
there may be some really really tough

123
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,640
choices now everybody wants to resolve
this short of military conflict

124
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,490
everybody knows
how costly that could be how

125
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,750
unpredictable it is once you begin this
interaction and military interaction

126
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,740
with this kind of a regime so why don't
we talk about it so much because we have

127
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,460
to have these options on the table a few
how do we have options yes we do have

128
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,790
options certainly we have options do you
think one of them would be shooting down

129
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,480
one of these missiles it could be there
a broad range of options that we have

130
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,200
available you know we have tremendous
military capability along with our

131
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,630
allies we practice that capability we
have our forces at a very high level of

132
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,340
readiness and an increasing level level
of readiness for this problem but but

133
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,120
what the president has done is he has
directed us to integrate what we're

134
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,470
doing diplomatically what we're doing
economically and with sanctions with our

135
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,030
plans and what we're prepared to do
militarily if you divorce what you're

136
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,020
what you're prepared to do militarily
from your diplomacy your diplomacy is

137
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,550
it's not going to be effective right but
at the same time to talk about will

138
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,690
totally destroy look we get the idea of
muscular rhetoric we get it but you are

139
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,590
dealing with a madman and don't all
Rhodes of any kind of military action

140
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,940
lead to great vulnerability for 10
million people in Seoul and all of those

141
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,080
American lives on the DMZ of course they
do every time we talk about this the

142
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,520
president first talks about the South
Korean people and the importance of of

143
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,020
us of us solving this problem in a way
that that doesn't that doesn't involve

144
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,370
the increased risk to our great allies
there but the president's ret rhetoric

145
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,870
was completely appropriate because
what's even more dangerous if there's a

146
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,800
lack of clarity previous presidents as
you know have made very similar

147
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,890
statements and the clause is that if you
know if if if North Korea attacks if

148
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,550
North Korea right takes these
provocative actions we may not have a

149
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,880
choice so that's the same standard that
it's always been you ever change the

150
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,120
line it is it no but the line of code
that you know it's it's much more

151
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,440
dangerous than ever though understood
because of the way this program has

152
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,060
progressed over the years what they're
doing previous previous agreements have

153
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,120
failed what they're doing has changed
but you're saying our standard the

154
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,390
United States standard for military
action has remained the same in terms of

155
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,540
what you'd have to perceive as threat
well and what we get what we're what we

156
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,180
have to do at this point is provide even
more options we have to work harder at

157
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,710
be sure we're ready for any eventuality
I mean this is a nation that poses a

158
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,510
grave threat to the world right if a if
a missile can reach the United States it

159
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,140
can reach other nations as well under
stiff if the non-proliferation regime

160
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,830
which means you're preventing other
nations from getting nuclear weapons in

161
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,300
a way that could destabilize the world
if that breaks down if you have if you

162
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,740
have Japan really arming if you have
South Korea arming at a higher level

163
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,060
which they're doing they have to that
that's that's destabilizing to the

164
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,950
region to the world and it's a threat to
all nations and so so the president has

165
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,770
called on all leaders our allies and
others including China Russia others to

166
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,940
do more understood the Russia
investigation I've been hearing you this

167
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,779
morning saying you're focused on other
things but it is a national security

168
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:02,120
issue that which Russia was doing to
impede our election it just is by

169
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,120
definition what do you feel about the
implications of what Russia did and do

170
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,170
you endorse what the special council is
doing well what we have done for the

171
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,000
president is we have developed a
strategy for for coping with Russia and

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,110
secretary Tillerson is in the lead on
this and essentially what we have to do

173
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,850
with Russia is three things we have to
confront their destabilizing behavior

174
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,760
the president is going to meet with
President poroshenko of Ukraine today

175
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,560
whose sovereignty has been threatened
and is under threat today from from

176
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,160
Russia the second thing that we have to
do is though we wanted to deter conflict

177
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,100
with Russia right this is a
nuclear-armed nation we've you know we

178
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,820
had the long cold war with the Soviet
Union we wanted to turn further

179
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,540
conflicts in areas where we are
interacting with with Russia we have to

180
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,079
make sure that we keep that in mind as
well but the third thing we want to do

181
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,350
is find areas of cooperation where we
can work together in our mutual

182
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,500
interests what we've seen in recent
years is Russia it does reflexively

183
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,160
anything they can to disrupt United
States interest to disrupt the interests

184
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,970
of our allies that's really silly okay
we should be able to work together in

185
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,750
some key areas surgery Torsten I think
has done a magnificent job in finding

186
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,520
some areas to cooperate with in Syria
for example to address that humanitarian

187
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,089
catastrophe there in a way that's
consistent with our long-term interests

188
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:24,290
and really denying Iran
this so-called land bridge that could

189
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,040
put an Iranian proxy army on the border
of Israel I mean this is there are big

190
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,180
big issues that we could use Russia's
help

191
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,350
we saw the story maybe today about how
Russia might be transshipping - yes

192
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,550
North Korea that's not in their interest
so we have to find these areas of

193
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,240
cooperation with Russia even as we
confront their destabilizing behavior

194
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,810
just to be clear on the record there I
want you to have the opportunity for

195
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,400
this the questions about what they did
who might have helped them and how to

196
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,550
stop it you believe those are all
legitimate questions for us to look at

197
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,110
of course and so does the president hmm
he's been he's been in different

198
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,080
positions on that issue but I want you
on the record on it thank you very much

199
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,630
