1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
The metro, no?

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,080
The metro is…

3
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,080
The crowds…

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:25,140
We are talking, only Mexico City, 6 million people
getting into Metrobus and Metro a day

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,500
Most of them are poor people.

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,300
It’s a cash economy, no?

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,120
They don’t have a checking account 
or a savings account

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,680
For Rosa and her daughter, Sandi, being part of 
Mexico City’s massive cash day-to-day economy

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,770
means joining the millions of people
who commute into the city center

10
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,860
through Mexico City's Metro, 
one of the largest in the world

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,280
And recently, the immense cash-filled Mexico City
has started to look very interesting

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,400
to one financial company in particular.

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,860
It is Mastercard’s global vision 
to go after cash

14
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,020
Cash is actually our biggest competitor, 
in Latin America

15
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,790
Cause it’s like 85% of the transactions
that people make, at least in Latin America

16
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,320
are cash based.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,120
Of the estimated 22 million people living
within the Greater Mexico City Area, about

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,180
55% of them live in the informal economy, 
and don’t have a bank account.

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,120
Even for those who do, it’s still a city
that runs on cash.

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,310
Lines form at ATMs on payday, so you can withdraw
enough to pay your bills,

21
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,510
and using credit cards to buy everyday things, like in one
of Mexico City’s busy public markets,

22
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,840
is only slowly catching on.

23
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,340
Mastercard is working with the government
to increase the amount of vendors accepting

24
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,680
credit cards, but they also want to increase the amount of people who have cards in the first place

25
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,600
What we want is more Mastercard cards in the market

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,820
That’s what we want.

27
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:21,110
We are going to bring more cards into the market,
using the transportation as an excuse

28
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,730
Remember those millions of daily riders?

29
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,140
They all pay for their Metro rides with one method

30
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,940
Mexico City’s Metro is one of the 
most subsidized in the world.

31
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,920
It only costs 5 pesos, about 25 cents, but
you can only pay in cash.

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,060
You can either buy a paper ticket, or buy
a refillable card

33
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,960
But there are no automatic vending machines

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,940
You have to line up, at a staffed ticket booth,
and fill up your metro card, in person,

35
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,940
in cash

36
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,940
There are long lines just to reload your transit card

37
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,000
So Mastercard approached Mexico City for a
partnership, saying look: “How about instead,

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,380
we just get everyone Mastercards that are
recharged automatically from your bank account?”

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,800
It would mean no more lines

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,940
For the metro, this sounds like a great deal

41
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,240
When it launches, it would just be like Apple Pay 
or other tap-and-go services

42
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,880
Tap into the Metro with your debit card from
Mastercard, and the money comes right out

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,420
of your bank account

44
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:50,120
But in order to tap in, you need a bank account
to start with, and alot of regular metro riders,

45
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,330
like Rosa and her daughter Sandi, 
simply don’t have one

46
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,540
Which is also why this whole Mastercard initiative sounds like a win

47
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,920
for the Secretary of Economic Development,

48
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,540
who is trying to bring millions of people out of the informal economy

49
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,720
and into a place where the government can see them

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,720
We need to make it easier for people to be
included and people to see the benefits and

51
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:21,120
not the risks, because for many people, there
risks are becoming part of the formal sector.

52
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,120
Well, you have to pay taxes.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,780
The City signed onto the deal in May 2017,
and the first varieties of debit cards

54
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,100
should arrive in November

55
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,560
Mastercard hasn’t provided alot of 
details about how these cards will be issued,

56
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,430
but they’re hoping that eventually, like
perhaps by mid 2018, everyone from a fruit vendor

57
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,020
to government payrolled employee, might have
some version of a metro-enabled debit card,

58
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,440
and that they would be using them for everyday purchases too

59
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,380
So what we’re getting in return:

60
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,680
The more the card is used, at the restaurant,
at the pharmacy, at the supermarket,

61
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,900
that's our business model

62
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,820
We make money out of that transaction.

63
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,360
Mastercard is paying to upgrade Mexico City’s
Metro because they want people to use the

64
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,180
card outside the Metro

65
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,779
The transaction fees that Mastercard would collect in bulk would definitely pay off

66
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,900
They’ve succeeded with this in Colombia,
with Bogotá’s express bus system,

67
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,160
where Mastercard introduced a similar debit card, targeted towards

68
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,040
people whose paychecks are directly deposited 
into their bank accounts

69
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,689
This is a perfect product for payrolls

70
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:36,800
Money comes in every 15 days.

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,400
So nobody needs to think about reloading
the card, because money will be there

72
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:52,220
But this highlights the larger divide in Mexico,
and in Latin America, between economic classes,

73
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:55,960
and the Catch 22 of going cashless

74
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,169
In this digital economy, you need a financial ID.

75
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,320
The only way to have a financial identity is to
have a bank account

76
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,600
So that’s the fundamental problem with cash

77
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,400
To get a bank account though, you need to
have enough cash in the first place

78
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,860
to even convince a bank of giving you a debit card

79
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,980
And for Rosa, that’s not so easy to do.

80
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,000
You have to understand 
how big the informal sector is

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,559
The restriction for this type of program is
the income level of the people

82
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,300
We are a very unequal country.

83
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,770
The Mexican minimum wage today is $4 a day.

84
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,340
It is ridiculous by all terms.

85
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:54,080
So as MasterCard targets cash in Mexico, the
reality is that, because so many people

86
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,360
live on so little of it,

87
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,440
a cashless economy is still a ways away

88
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,120
Oh sure!

89
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,700
Maybe 2030, something like that.

90
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,440
Most modern cities in the world are moving for that.

91
00:07:40,440 --> 00:00:00,000
And Mexico City is not going to be the exception.
