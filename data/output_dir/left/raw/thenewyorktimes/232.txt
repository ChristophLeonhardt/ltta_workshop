1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,940
I’m Apache, but really
that’s the government’s name,

2
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,260
because they can’t say “Dził Łigai N'dee.”

3
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,830
They will tell me
how awesome they

4
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,350
think it is that I’ve decided
to be a part of my culture.

5
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,365
And it’s funny to me.

6
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:31,464
It hits me really weird,
and I don’t like it.

7
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,130
And I didn’t know why
at first, but it’s

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,830
because I haven’t decided
to be a part of my culture.

9
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,480
I live it every day.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,620
I’m more comfortable with
the term “native,” divorced

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,110
from “Native American.”

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,750
I know there are people
who use “indigenous.”

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,810
If there is one term I
do not like to be called,

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,490
it is “American Indian.”

15
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,540
And for me, to be
indigenous is to have

16
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,200
an intimate and interconnected
relationship to a homeland.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,660
And so that’s really important,
because land is, you know,

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,870
tied to every aspect
of who we are.

19
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,620
Being native in a city is
almost a daily reminder

20
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,930
of your people’s
erasure. Of the fact

21
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,060
that people don’t even
remember that you’re here

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,410
and that you exist.

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,300
But what I did encounter was
just this preconceived notion

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,030
that all Native
Americans are dead.

25
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,270
I’ve had older white
men come up to me

26
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,410
and say, “Oh, man, if
this was 40 years ago,

27
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,170
I could just do whatever
I wanted to you.”

28
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,610
You know, the
cattle outside doing

29
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:42,100
the work and the dog inside
the house, those are property.

30
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,200
Those are the black
folks in America.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,600
They are property to white men.

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,700
Then the exotic antelope
on the wall or the exotic —

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,780
that’s how natives are
perceived in America.

34
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,000
We’re treated like animals.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,330
They monitor our blood quantum.

36
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,150
I mean, besides
dogs and horses,

37
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,730
I don’t know of any other animal

38
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,440
that they monitor
the blood quantum.

39
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,210
The way I explain
it to people is,

40
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,580
imagine a pizza with
different slices,

41
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,610
and let’s say 32 slices.

42
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,810
Of the 32 slices, I’m 28 Apache.

43
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,940
That’s my particular
blood quantum.

44
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,640
And Native Americans in the
U.S. are the only minority group

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,240
who have to prove their
nativeness on an Indian card.

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,120
It’s used to divide native
people against each other,

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,490
because it can be
used as a way to say,

48
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,050
I am more native than you.

49
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,410
And I was a part of that, too.

50
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,530
I used my 4 fourths to kind of
make myself feel better

51
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,120
against other people.

52
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,360
The one drop rule, meaning
that one drop of black blood

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,400
makes you black, that was to
keep as many people oppressed

54
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,405
or legitimize their
oppression as possible.

55
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:04,470
But on the other side,
one drop of anything else

56
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,926
completely dilutes you
as a native person.

57
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:09,300
So if you’re a
native person,

58
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,770
you have the one drop
of something else,

59
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,144
then suddenly
you’re less native.

60
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:13,380
So it’s the opposite.

61
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,260
Traditionally, within the Apache
society, you go by the mother.

62
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,460
And if the mother is recognized
as Apache, she has her clan,

63
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,100
the children are
unquestionably Apache.

64
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,740
Not in the American
context, not when

65
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,100
patriarchy trumps matriarchy.

66
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,210
So what does that mean?

67
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,720
My sisters are short
1/16 of a degree.

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,905
What does that mean?

69
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:39,830
Does it mean their
pinkies aren’t Apache?

70
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,100
What does that mean?

71
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,750
You know, being a
mixed race person is

72
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,190
a whole other side
of it, but that’s

73
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,810
a very common
experience in our tribe.

74
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,920
So it’s not as if we’re
unusual in that way.

75
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,920
What is unusual is the
admixture of black.

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,090
My grandfather actually
doesn’t want people —

77
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,860
if he hears that somebody
from the tribe is coming over,

78
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,440
he won’t come out of his room.

79
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:14,820
Because he doesn’t want them to
know that he’s that complexion,

80
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,260
that he doesn’t —

81
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,050
I guess he doesn’t want me
to be affiliated with having

82
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,160
African-American blood.

83
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,420
But I mean, I say it.

84
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,850
It’s not going to
change anything.

85
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,558
If it were up to the
American government,

86
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:31,290
natives wouldn’t be around.

87
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,890
Because after a certain
time, that blood will dilute.

88
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,210
It will go out.

89
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,430
And so if there’s no native
peoples to provide benefits,

90
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,190
then we’re not obligated to
meet these treaty rights.

91
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,310
And if we’re not obligated to
meet these treaty contracts,

92
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,600
then the land is available,
the resources are available.

93
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,260
And I think that
that essential point

94
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,030
about our claim to
sovereignty, our claim to land,

95
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,830
our claim to a culture,
our claim to resources

96
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,700
is one that gets lost if we
don’t insist upon the fact

97
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,900
that we are nations.

98
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,320
And we have taken huge
steps to decolonizing,

99
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,630
and that proof comes
from people being

100
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,440
able to have the opportunities
to speak their language,

101
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,910
to be on their ancestral land.

102
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,630
But the thing with
decolonization

103
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,570
is that it’s an ongoing process,
just like grieving,

104
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,340
just like any loss.

105
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,380
As much as possible now,
I try to tell people

106
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,200
that I have a Native
American name,

107
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,950
and maybe it doesn’t
mean anything to you,

108
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,380
but it means everything to me.

109
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,760
My name, maybe, doesn’t have a
romanticized, Hollywood Indian

110
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,940
name, but my name has
more meaning than that.

111
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,330
My name means that
my family survived.

112
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,400
My family survived disease.

113
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,100
My family survived Catholicism.

114
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,650
My family survived settler
colonialism, and my family,

115
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,760
they survived.

116
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,600
I survived.

117
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,210
My existence is resistance.

118
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,020
Me saying my name
is Skiumtalx,

119
00:06:06,020 --> 00:00:00,000
that is resistance in and of itself.
