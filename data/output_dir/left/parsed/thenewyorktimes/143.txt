“Congratulations.”
“Thank you so much.”
“Congratulations.”
“Can I have a hug?”
“Yes indeed.”

“She’s looking at herself
on television right now.
How are you feeling?
Can you put it into words?”
“Nope.”
I’m good. It’s a 
whirlwind. It’s crazy.
When we vote,

they’ve got money.
Hi, this is Alexandria Ocasio.
Well, I think what it means
is that working-class Americans
are ready and
willing and eager to hear
a message of economic,
social and racial justice
and a plan.
Just being unapologetic
about what I believe
and what my values were and
to be very honest about what
I thought the path forward
was and also showing people
how I was
walking the walk now.”
“I had my whole family 
vote for you.”
“Oh my God, thank you.”
“Thank you so much.
I can’t believe it.”
“O.K.”
“We gotta get the selfie.”
“Congratulations.”
“Hi, thank you.
I hope
that this ushers
in an era where
we kind of expand
what it means to
be a candidate,
expand who can be 
a candidate
in this time.
What this race
has really shown
is that anything is possible.”
