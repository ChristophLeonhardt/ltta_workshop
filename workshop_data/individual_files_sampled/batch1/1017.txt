fuck mile is almost 15 and living in a Syrian refugee camp when her parents told her she was engaged she fought with them for days before she agreed to marry she's now sixteen as a five month old daughter and another baby on the way she says she loves her husband but their lives are hard they work 10 hours a day every day at a factory people say to me you are still young you have a baby and you're married at this age I always say this is the normal life for my situation and I'm okay with that more than seven years into the Syrian war life is becoming increasingly difficult for Refugees forced to flee to countries such as Jordan poverty is the primary reason driving families to marry off their girls according to statistics from Jordan's court system child marriage among Syrian refugees primarily girls is on the rise in 2014 15 percent of all Syrian marriages included a child bride now it's 36 percent last year Jordan's Chief Justice issued new stipulations allowing girls the right to demand a marriage contract with conditions including completing their education and working but the United Nations Children's agency UNICEF says girls need even greater protections what we would like to do more is the prevention has really worked with Sharia Courts worked with religious leaders in really promoting the right of child girls to education that we need to break the cycle of poverty and prevent them from dropping out of school and going into early marriage Fatma says her biggest regret is dropping out of school at the age of 10 she hopes early marriage and her family stops with her generation I wish I could have continued my studies this is my destiny I won't let my daughter get married young she needs to be 25 or so it's too much responsibility when asked about her dreams for the future Fatma says she just wants to live in one room independently from her in-laws Natacha guy named al jazeera amen
