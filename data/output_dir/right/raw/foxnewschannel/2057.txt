1
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:09,787
>> I'M WONDERING IF SENATOR

2
00:00:09,787 --> 00:00:11,789
HALL WOULD FEEL THE SAME IF

3
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:13,290
STUDENTS WALKED IN AND

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,159
INSTEAD OF THE WORD GOD THE

5
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:16,427
WORD ALLAH WELCOMED STUDENTS

6
00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:17,127
TO THEIR SCHOOL?

7
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:18,696
>> GOD WHO SPOKE AGAINST

8
00:00:18,696 --> 00:00:19,830
MONEY AND THE MONEY I CARRY

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,465
IN MY WALLET HAS TO SAY IN

10
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:22,232
GOD WE TRUST.

11
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:25,369
I THINK THAT'S OFFENSIVE.

12
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:25,836
BRIAN: EXACTLY.

13
00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:27,271
HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN SAYING

14
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:27,571
THAT?

15
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:29,306
MAKES TOTAL SENSE.

16
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:30,641
AINSLEY: DAN BONGINO THE

17
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:31,975
FORMER NYPD OFFICER AND

18
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:33,911
SECRET SERVICE AGENT HOSTED

19
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:35,746
THE DAN BONGINO SHOW.

20
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:36,980
YOU HAD SENATOR DAN HALL AND

21
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,382
THE ONE YOU SAW THERE SAID

22
00:00:38,382 --> 00:00:40,184
IT WAS OFFENSIVE SENATOR

23
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:41,618
JOHN MARTY IN THE STATE OF

24
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:41,985
MINNESOTA.

25
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:43,220
THEY ARE MAD BECAUSE IN GOD

26
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,722
WE TRUST IS NOW GOING TO BE

27
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:46,256
WELL, THERE IS A REPUBLICAN

28
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:48,792
SENATOR WHO WANTS -- WHO

29
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:49,693
SPONSORED LEGISLATION TO PUT

30
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:51,729
IN GOD WE TRUST BACK IN THE

31
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:52,963
SCHOOLS.

32
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:56,467
THESE TWO DEMOCRATS.

33
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:57,034
STEVE: ULTIMATELY.

34
00:00:57,034 --> 00:00:57,735
AINSLEY: WE ARE OFFENDED BY

35
00:00:57,735 --> 00:00:58,802
IT WE DON'T EACH WANT IT IN

36
00:00:58,802 --> 00:00:59,203
OUR MONEY.

37
00:00:59,203 --> 00:01:01,071
>> I THINK IN THE STUPID

38
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:02,239
OLYMPICS OF COMMENTS, THESE

39
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,340
GUYS GET THE GOLD.

40
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,108
THEY CAN SHARE IT, ACTUALLY.

41
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,144
WE'LL HAVE TWO OF THEM ON

42
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:08,212
THE MEDAL STANDS UP THERE

43
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:09,546
GETTING THE GOLD MEDALS IN

44
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:10,981
THESE DOPEY OLYMPICS.

45
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:15,352
I DON'T GET IT.

46
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:17,087
I MEAN THAT USUALLY I HAVE A

47
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:18,489
GOOD GRASP ON THE STUPIDITY

48
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:19,590
OF THE RADICAL LEFT.

49
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,391
LET ME BE CLEAR.

50
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:21,825
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ALL

51
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:22,192
DEMOCRATS.

52
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:22,860
MY CHURCH IS FULL OF

53
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,927
DEMOCRATS WHO LOVE THEIR GOD

54
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:25,329
AND LOVE THEIR COUNTRY.

55
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:26,930
THE RADICAL FAR LEFT CLEARLY

56
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,298
DOES NOT WANT COMPETITION

57
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:28,999
WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

58
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:30,701
SO, THEY ARE IN THIS NEVER

59
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:31,969
ENDING BATTLE AGAINST

60
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:32,703
RELIGION AND GOD.

61
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:34,505
AND I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

62
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:35,773
WHAT THEY THINK THEY ARE

63
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:36,106
GETTING.

64
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:37,608
DO THEY THINK PEOPLE OUT

65
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:39,910
THERE, CHURCH-GOERS, PEOPLE

66
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,145
WHO LOVE THEIR GOD AND

67
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:42,112
RELIGION ARE GOING TO TAKE

68
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:43,013
THIS LYING DOWN?

69
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:43,714
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

70
00:01:43,714 --> 00:01:45,516
OF COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO

71
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:46,850
FIGHT BACK AT THE ELECTION

72
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,485
BOOTH AND IDEOLOGICALLY.

73
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:50,554
THIS IS ABSURD STRATEGY.

74
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:51,355
STEVE: DAN, WHAT DO YOU MEAN

75
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:53,023
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE

76
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:55,726
COMPETITION FROM THE CHURCH?

77
00:01:55,726 --> 00:01:58,228
>> HERE'S -- IF YOU ARE A

78
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:00,030
FAR LEFT RADICAL, YOU NEED

79
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,365
PEOPLE TO BE SURGICALLY

80
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:02,032
ATTACHED TO THE GOVERNMENT

81
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:04,067
FOR THEIR MONEY, FOR THEIR

82
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,969
HEALTHCARE, FOR THEIR KID'S

83
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:06,336
EDUCATION.

84
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:07,971
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE SAID TO ME

85
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:09,406
ONCE, THERE IS NO POWER IN

86
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:10,473
YES FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

87
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:11,275
MEANING THE GOVERNMENT HAS

88
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:14,611
TO BE ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE

89
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:16,647
NO -- AND THAT WAY CAN YOU

90
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:18,882
COME TO THEM FOR PERMISSION.

91
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:21,652
THEY DON'T WANT COMPETITION.

92
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:23,487
THE RIGHT GRANTED BY GOD TO

93
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:26,523
DEFEND YOURSELF AND LIFE AND

94
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:28,592
LIBERTY AND HAPPINESS.

95
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:29,493
THEY DON'T WANT THAT.

96
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:30,727
THEY HAVE TO DETACH FROM YOU

97
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:32,296
GOD AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY,

98
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:33,864
HENCE THIS NEVER ENDING

99
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:34,731
BATTLE AGAINST RELIGION.

100
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:36,133
THIS IS GOING TO BLOW UP ON

101
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:37,668
THEM IF IT HASN'T ALREADY

102
00:02:37,668 --> 00:02:40,070
BIG TIME THOUGH.

103
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,005
AINSLEY: JUST TO CLARIFY,

104
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:44,475
SENATOR JOHN MARTY AND

105
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:45,108
SENATOR DAN HALL THE

106
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:46,243
REPUBLICAN WHO WANTS THIS IN

107
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:49,546
OUR SCHOOLS.

108
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:50,180
BRIAN: LET'S MOVE ON TO

109
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,814
ANOTHER THING.

110
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:53,183
SAME GUY, OKAY, SAME ISSUE.

111
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:54,585
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GAME

112
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:54,918
ITSELF.

113
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:56,019
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT

114
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:56,954
HAPPENS BEFORE THE GAME.

115
00:02:56,954 --> 00:02:58,989
TALK ABOUT THE NFL AND THE

116
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:00,224
KNEELING POLICY.

117
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,492
IT HURT BUSINESS AND RATINGS

118
00:03:01,492 --> 00:03:02,559
AND CAUSED A NATIONAL

119
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,527
DIALOGUE AND THE PRESIDENT

120
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:05,796
HAS BEEN RIGHT BEHIND IT HE

121
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:06,930
HAS BEEN OFFENDED BY IT LIKE

122
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,831
A LOT OF US.

123
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:09,500
THE NFL HAS DECIDED TO LEAVE

124
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,134
IT UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL 30

125
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:12,102
PLUS TEAMS IN THE LEAGUE TO

126
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:15,305
DECIDE IT ON THEIR OWN

127
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:17,307
NATIONAL ANTHEM POLICY.

128
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:19,076
I DON'T MIND THIS.

129
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:21,912
I FEEL AS THOUGH THESE FREE

130
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:22,980
AGENTS, IF YOU GO TO THE

131
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,680
PATRIOTS YOU ARE

132
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,147
STANDARDING.

133
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:25,649
GOT TO SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS.

134
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:26,850
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

135
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,285
WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT

136
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:29,620
TEAM YOU WANT TO BE DRAFTED

137
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,954
ON, YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO

138
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:35,192
THAT TEAM, GO TO ANOTHER

139
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:35,492
TEAM.

140
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:36,226
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH,

141
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:36,793
THIS DO YOU?

142
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:37,861
>> I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM

143
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:38,529
WITH IT AT ALL.

144
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:40,030
IF I WAS AN NFL OWNER.

145
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,032
YOU TALK ABOUT REALLY SILLY

146
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:42,900
BUSINESS DECISIONS.

147
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,501
IF THERE WERE A BOOK LIKE

148
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,737
HOW TO DESTROY YOUR BUSINESS

149
00:03:46,737 --> 00:03:48,005
IN 12 SIMPLE STEPS, STEP

150
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:49,506
NUMBER ONE WOULD BE YOU

151
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:51,842
KNOW, WATCH WHAT THE NFL

152
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:53,710
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO KNEEL ON

153
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,511
THE FIELD.

154
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:55,546
I WOULD FIRE EVERY ONE OF

155
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:56,179
THESE GUYS?

156
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:57,514
IS THERE GOING TO BE BLOW

157
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:58,549
BACK FROM THE RADICAL FAR

158
00:03:58,549 --> 00:03:58,849
LEFT?

159
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,017
OF COURSE, THERE IS BLOW

160
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:00,817
BACK FOR EVERYTHING.

161
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:02,319
THERE IS A COUPLE KIDS IN

162
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,520
MOMMY'S BAMPLET WITH THEIR

163
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,454
TWITTER MAKING THEM SEEM

164
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:05,589
LIKE THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT

165
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:06,189
THAN THEY ARE.

166
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:07,391
THE REAL AMERICANS OUT THERE

167
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:08,792

BY.

172
00:04:14,431 --> 00:04:15,866
THIS IF THEY FIRED EVERY

173
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:16,867
SINGLE ONE OF THESE GUYS

174
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,435
THEY MIGHT GET THEIR

175
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:19,336
AUDIENCE BACK.

176
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:20,504
I LIKE THE DECISION.

177
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,272
I WILL TELL YOU, I WAS AT

178
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:24,007
THE NRA CONVENTION IN

179
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:25,275
DALLAS, YOU WOULD BE

180
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:26,209
SURPRISED, BRIAN, MAYBE YOU

181
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:26,577
WOULDN'T.

182
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:28,078
I SPOKE TO THOUSANDS OF

183
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:29,846
PEOPLE THIS WEEKEND, AND THE

184
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:31,148
NFL IS STILL A BIG ISSUE

185
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:32,015
WITH THEM.

186
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:33,150
AND I DON'T MEAN IT IN A

187
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,684
GOOD WAY.

188
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:36,053
THEY WERE REALLY UPSET.

189
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:37,287
STEVE: IT'S NOT A DECISION.

190
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:38,589
THEY ARE PUNTING ON IT WE

191
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:39,790
DON'T WANT TO DECIDE.

192
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,391
