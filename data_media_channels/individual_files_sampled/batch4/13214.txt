now the fact that Planned Parenthood is spending tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats get elected is that's that's nothing new they've been doing that for a very long time but there is something different this time around something is a little bit different because actually the Republican Party is funding the effort the Republican Party is funding the effort to unseat themselves okay just if you're wondering about how smart the Republican Party is there you go the Republican Party which I should remind you has been in control of the government for two years that Republican Party is funding Planned Parenthood and thus funding this effort to destroy them but I you know more importantly they are funding also an effort to destroy babies the the government is continuing to hand hundreds of millions of dollars a year to a company that executes over 300 thousand babies a year I feel like I should I should repeat that figure just so just just for emphasis the Republican part of the Planned Parenthood sorry I get them confused now because they seem very similar Planned Parenthood aborts over three hundred thousand babies every year and this is from they claim oh well abortion is only 3 percent of what we do which is a total lie by the tits a completely made-up statistic it's an absolute total complete lie but it also doesn't even matter because whatever percentage of the overall thing it is makes no difference the fact remains we can look at the raw numbers and see they kill 300,000 human beings a year
