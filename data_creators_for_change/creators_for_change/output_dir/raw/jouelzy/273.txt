<font color="#CCCCCC">travelled for people of color</font>

19
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,829
specifically entering into the tech

20
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,629
startup world where there's nothing they

21
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,730
look like us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so if he scoots a</font>

22
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,410
little bit more over this way so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,640
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> blocking his face my name is devo</font>

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,550
lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> know me as a producer</font>

25
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,070
started producing John Legend Kanye West

26
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,780
and Britney Spears and common

27
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,170
and more recently I started an

28
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,750
interactive video technology company

29
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,280
called adventure and that's what I made

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">you interested in starting in entering</font>

31
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,740
into the tech industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let me I</font>

32
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,869
guess I'll give the story kind of how

33
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:23,509
this came to be I<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was the genesis</font>

34
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:25,009
of and kind of what made me really

35
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,159
propelled see an opportunity so I had a

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,229
band that was signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be called riot</font>

37
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:32,750
in Paris and we've got a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

38
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,320
can find on youtube for the silver

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,170
attack of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> five foot hipster and this</font>

40
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,369
was as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know the first</font>

41
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,440
interactive true shan adventure music

42
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,640
food this is about three and a half

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,039
years now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was tons of videos i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

44
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,539
an invitation<font color="#CCCCCC"> today what was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

45
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:50,720
interesting was that we made a linear

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,520
regular version where you couldn't make

47
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,690
choices that we had one where you

48
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,600
couldn't make choices and they have the

49
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,350
exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same music for each one and so we</font>

50
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,670
would see on the later version the

51
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,490
responses were lukewarm right like this

52
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,920
song is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay whatever and the</font>

53
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,929
interactive one exact same song same

54
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,579
visual content except you're picking

55
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:12,739
what happens next this song is amazing

56
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:15,860
these guys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in be huge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

57
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,320
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> like really stood out to us</font>

58
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,910
then all these media companies are

59
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,130
approaching me saying we need that

60
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,519
technology for our own stuff and they

61
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,739
have the exact same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of reasoning so</font>

62
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:30,200
in the size that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter into</font>

63
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,329
the startup or start your own tech<font color="#CCCCCC"> firm</font>

64
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:34,519
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what is the research that you do</font>

65
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,200
and like what its preparation that one

66
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,930
which would recommend really is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pointed</font>

67
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,390
for like

68
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,890
before they jump full swing into I think

69
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,740
it's a matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really finding out is</font>

70
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,620
there a market for what you want to do

71
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,480
so I spent lots of time researching to

72
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,260
find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and and then do you really</font>

73
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,070
have the skill set to offer that you're

74
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">just doing our standard business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> group</font>

75
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,030
research<font color="#CCCCCC"> really and then I've got check</font>

76
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,390
on whether you really want to devote the

77
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,870
next few years of your life what do you

78
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,760
think that's a really big time

79
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,730
commitment is for someone I think one to

80
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,820
two years it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably what you'd need</font>

81
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,489
to find out if it's maybe something that

82
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,200
could reasonably work what is your

83
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,980
different adventure what is good about

84
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so adventure if you go to adventure</font>

85
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,700
back to you the ADV entr that TV you'll

86
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,980
see some videos on there for example

87
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,620
there's a John Legend video where you

88
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,150
teaching you how to play all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of me on</font>

89
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,920
the piano and that you look and then you

90
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,880
literally play the piano on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> video</font>

91
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,400
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> him in real time and the video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

92
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,500
responding I tried it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I couldn't get</font>

93
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,170
past the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> unit I really was like</font>

94
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,120
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piano and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just like</font>

95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,540
I give up just sing the song right so

96
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,450
but it's interesting and the real point

97
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,549
of is the real point of it is really

98
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,230
just to show you the possibilities of

99
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,880
what you can do with video it doesn't

100
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,500
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a one-way data stream right</font>

101
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,900
we can go it should be responsive like

102
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,049
the rest of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so what we have</font>

103
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:15,269
is a platform or anyone can log on and

104
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,589
create responsive interactive so let's

105
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,779
get more into kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your background so</font>

106
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,720
for someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who had a direct in into an</font>

107
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,670
industry that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people kind of</font>

108
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,880
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> glamorise fantasize</font>

109
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,100
about let you are you're in the know

110
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,400
with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are very kind</font>

111
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,800
of worshipped in a sense why would you

112
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,600
walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from something like that where</font>

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,500
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had direct access to I mean I still</font>

114
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">work with a lot of these guys but the</font>

115
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,210
question is really like what is your

116
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">legacy extra for me what is your legacy</font>

117
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,450
and how are you going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the most</font>

118
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">money possible to write and I don't</font>

119
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,580
think it's through selling music and I

120
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,980
think my skill set lends<font color="#E5E5E5"> us up to a lot</font>

121
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,770
bigger opportunities then writing songs

122
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,840
you know but why not just ride out in

123
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,420
the outside right according to Instagram

124
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I try something fabulous life so you</font>

125
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,600
know why not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just hop on the bandwagon</font>

126
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,340
if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind name is gonna be as big as</font>

127
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,870
he is maybe I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well he's</font>

128
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,360
blood so you can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> still fine i</font>

129
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,860
mean you produced a song<font color="#CCCCCC"> graham that one</font>

130
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,590
room but when it's like the upswing

131
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,230
right but every opportunity to be the

132
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,780
bandwagon person because essentially you

133
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,850
kind of you make the back wheels the

134
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,800
bandwagon<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can review patron it</font>

135
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,190
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wheels fell off why why</font>

136
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,790
not I think there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that do</font>

137
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,210
ride the bandwagon and don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

138
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">not have other options or ability I</font>

139
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,849
really think pretty highly of myself

140
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:57,959
abilities so I fully think that

141
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,219
adventure or something else I can run

142
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:02,889
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a multi-billion dollar company</font>

143
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:06,189
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> excitement that's what</font>

144
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:09,219
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going after is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like being on</font>

145
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:12,039
someone's beck and call is it what I'm

146
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,520
really built for you what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

147
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,139
about kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this age of social media</font>

148
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:19,449
where a lot of people perpetuate a

149
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:21,369
certain lifestyle everyone kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wants</font>

150
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:25,119
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit into this mole that you know for</font>

151
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,800
lack of a better example kind of like

152
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,939
you know who want to be like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

153
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:29,769
protect you they want the large

154
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:32,169
following they want to really have this

155
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:34,269
look and the Zika so they try to

156
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,979
perpetuate this lifestyle social media

157
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you're not really to make on posting</font>

158
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:40,959
up a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff but now i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

159
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,339
trying to do me like i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot</font>

160
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,800
of time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might talk about people who</font>

161
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,209
are doing things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm doing things what</font>

162
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:49,869
do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

163
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,429
complications for people of color

164
00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:53,919
entering the tech space at an early

165
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,319
stage when you starting up a company and

166
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,879
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions to be answered</font>

167
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,610
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of information we go</font>

168
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,180
off of guesses we go off of whatever

169
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,119
small references that we have and when

170
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:10,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're of color there's not a lot of</font>

171
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:13,599
references to base your stature home or

172
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,930
your potential so what I go into

173
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,089
meetings and I got multiple degrees I

174
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:21,159
know these people that helped make<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

175
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:25,689
money but with<font color="#E5E5E5"> little information you as</font>

176
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:27,339
an investor or even as a customer

177
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,409
whatever you haven't seen people that

178
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:33,579
look like me win so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to make up</font>

179
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your head</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe this image of me</font>

180
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:37,790
or whoever

181
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,010
me winning when Mark Zuckerberg is the

182
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,960
more kind of accepted paradigm for what

183
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tech winner looks like I got because</font>

184
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,350
again like working with Kanye when years

185
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,940
ago when he stepped<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room with the</font>

186
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,670
pink polo shirt or whatever people was

187
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,890
like that's not what a rapper looks like

188
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,300
right so work it's the same conversation

189
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's the same conversation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you just</font>

190
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,640
have to make stuff look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> magic right</font>

191
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,920
so I'm we're up here we're about to

192
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,630
close<font color="#E5E5E5"> deals with just some of the</font>

193
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,850
biggest entertainment companies in the

194
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,670
country it's just me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> my partner</font>

195
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,140
doing tech integration for these big

196
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,650
companies so you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think if we look</font>

197
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,990
like other more accepted persons we

198
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,290
probably would get further quicker that

199
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,780
doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't get rid of</font>

200
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,000
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about one thing you were</font>

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,250
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about earlier that you so last</font>

202
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,900
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about three years ago you</font>

203
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,940
were upon finishing your MBA you were

204
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,090
going to publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> a book yeah but I how</font>

205
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,620
much I do because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a good</font>

206
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,930
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of even when you feel like</font>

207
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,210
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not at a level to accomplish</font>

208
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,800
something it's being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to have</font>

209
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,090
discernment that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not at that</font>

210
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,980
level and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then finding a way to get to</font>

211
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,270
that level versus completely leaving

212
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,160
something alone<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

213
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,310
address what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> you publish it</font>

214
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,930
yeah so what we talked about is a book

215
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,460
that I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing at columbia</font>

216
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,350
business school with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the professor of a</font>

217
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,070
professor<font color="#E5E5E5"> Schmidt and they wanted to</font>

218
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,020
call it everything I didn't learn be

219
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,010
school I learned from Kanye West and the

220
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,930
basic sentiment of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book is this</font>

221
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,100
certain things that they teach you in

222
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,960
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> school with certain kind of</font>

223
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,589
classic business theory that in my work

224
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:28,690
in the pop culture of world and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

225
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,120
music business especially with with mr.

226
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,800
West a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these paradigms are are</font>

227
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,920
following so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way in</font>

228
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,760
marketing class they teach you every

229
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,620
every market the more competitors coming

230
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,030
to that market and the price goes down

231
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,339
until there's no profit to be had in

232
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,860
that in that market where<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we came</font>

233
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,990
into the game with this these new

234
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,630
artists we priced everything higher off

235
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,160
off top just so you know that it's that

236
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,010
isn't as<font color="#E5E5E5"> premium priced a supremely</font>

237
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,490
level product right then we put in more

238
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,050
higher design you can in digital stuff

239
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,329
into the cds when they have

240
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:15,790
using so right and then so then we say

241
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,290
what a Southwest Airlines do in the

242
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,379
situation server anyways I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font>

243
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:22,239
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing of it I didn't think</font>

244
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,980
that the tone was coming through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

245
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,220
I want I very informed but still cool

246
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,139
yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I took a step back and I started</font>

247
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:35,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">writing for blogs to get my toned</font>

248
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,509
together and so I was writing for sound

249
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:40,299
control started writing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> courts it</font>

250
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:41,829
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting the last thing I wrote</font>

251
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:43,509
for courts was actually a chapter from

252
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,860
the book i shrunk down and I worked on

253
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,199
the tone I think I finally am getting a

254
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,420
groove for it so that last thing I cut

255
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">out a lot of people responding to it</font>

256
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:57,850
different which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like records by</font>

257
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,220

258
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,619
different venture investor people from

259
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:05,350
google or I re reblocking it on their

260
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,299
own blogs and it feel like my writing

261
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,009
with a good next publish a book I just

262
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,239
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that anyone would read it</font>

263
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back and sort of my own</font>

know how to now do it so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

270
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,560
