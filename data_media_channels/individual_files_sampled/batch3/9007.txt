TO WASHINGTON, D.C., AFTER THAT SUMMIT THAT COULD CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY. AS WE GO "OUTNUMBERED" OVER TIME. I'M HARRIS FAULKNER. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CELEBRATING THAT HISTORIC SIT DOWN WITH NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN. THE TWO LEADERS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT THAT MADE A BROAD COMMITMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES TO PROVIDE NORTH KOREA WITH SECURITY GUARANTEES IN EXCHANGE FOR DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. THE PRESIDENT SAYS WILL HALT JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES WITH SOUTH KOREA. AND AT THE NORTH HAD AGREED TO DESTROY A MAJOR MISSILE TESTING SITE. THE PRESIDENT ALSO OPEN THE DOOR FOR KIM JONG UN TO VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE AS HE EXPRESSES OPTIMISM THAT THE DICTATOR IS COMMITTED TO PEACE. WATCH. CHAIRMAN KIM AND I JUST SIGNED A STATEMENT IN WHICH HE AFFIRMED HIS UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. WE ALSO AGREED TO VIGOROUS NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE AGREEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. HE WANTS TO DO THAT. CHAIRMAN KIM HAS TOLD ME THAT NORTH KOREA HAS ALREADY DESTROYED A MAJOR MISSILE ENGINE TESTING SITE. PEACE IS ALWAYS WORTH THE EFFORT PEACE IS ALWAYS WORTH THE EFFOR EFFORT. Harris: OF COURSE THE EFFORT BACK HOME SOMETIMES INVOLVES POLITICS. DEMOCRATS SAY THEY'RE NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE PRESIDENT'S DEAL. WATCH. WORRISOME, VERY WORRISOME. THAT THIS JOINT STATEMENT IS SO IMPRECISE. WITH THE UNITED STATES HAS GAINED IS OF A VAGUE AND UNVERIFIABLE AT BEST. WHAT NORTH KOREA HAS GAINED HOWEVER IS TANGIBLE AND LASTING. I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THIS IS THE WEAKEST STATEMENT I HAVE EVER SEEN COME OUT OF ANY ENGAGEMENT WITH NORTH KOREA. Harris: A VERY SOUR THERE. A CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS JOINS US FROM SINGAPORE. IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT RIGHT HERE AT THE TOP THAT THE DEMOCRATS BACK TO SOME OTHER DEALS WITH NORTH KOREA THAT MIGHT'VE LOOKED WRONG ON THE SURFACE BUT EVENTUALLY FELL APART WHEN NORTH KOREA DECIDED TO CHEAT ON AT THE PRESIDENT INSISTING THAT HE IS GOING TO HOLD SANCTIONS AND OTHER ACTIONS OVER KIM JONG UN'S HEAD TO MAKE SURE THAT HE DOES COMPLY WITH THE SPIRIT OF THIS AGREEMENT. SOME SEEM SOME CRITICISM, WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME SKEPTICISM OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN SINGAPORE BUT FROM U.K. FOREIGN MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON JUST A SHORT TIME AGO, A STATEMENT OF PRAISE. JOHNSON SAYING THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS THE STABILITY OF THE REGION VITAL TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. TO SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE SEEM TO APPRECIATE WITH THE PRESIDENT DID. THE PRESIDENT POINTING OUT THAT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING, IT'S A VERY GENERAL DOCUMENT, THE PRESIDENT SAID HE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ENOUGH TIME DURING THE SUMMIT ITSELF TO GET INTO A LOT OF SPECIFICS. IF THOSE DETAILS ARE TO BE WORKED OUT IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD BY A TEAM LED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO AND HE'LL HAVE HIS FIRST MEETINGS WITH THE NORTH KOREAN DELEGATION SOMETIME WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING SOME BLOWBACK FROM A MEMBER OF HIS OWN PARTY ON THE MILITARY FRONT. LINDSEY GRAHAM CRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT STATED DESIRE TO ONE DAY, NOT NECESSARILY NOW REMOVE U.S. TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA. LISTEN HERE. I WANT TO GET OUR SOLDIERS OUTCOME I WANT TO BRING OUR SOLDIERS BACK HOME. WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 32,000 SOLDIERS IN SOUTH KOREA. AND I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BRING THEM BACK HOME. THAT'S NOT PART OF THE EQUATION RIGHT NOW. AT SOME POINT, I HOPE IT WILL BE BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED AT THE TOP OF THIS AT THE PRESIDENT DOES WANT TO END THESE JOINT U.S. SOUTH KOREAN MILITARY EXERCISES SAYING THAT THEY'RE VERY PROVOCATIVE AND THAT THEY WERE EXPENSIVE AS WELL. THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT IF HE CAN GET NORTH KOREA TO DENUCLEARIZE, IF HE CAN BRING NORTH KOREA INTO THE LIGHT IN THE PRESIDENT HAD A VERY INTERESTING VIDEO THAT HE PLAYED FOR KIM JONG UN. HE HAD THAT PRODUCED WHERE IT SHOWED NORTH KOREA COMING INTO THE LIGHT AND THEN A QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER GOING TO DO? BUT IF THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT HE CAN DO ALL OF THAT, THERE MAY NOT BE A NEED FOR AS
