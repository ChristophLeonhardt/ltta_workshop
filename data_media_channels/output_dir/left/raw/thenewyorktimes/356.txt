[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,650
Tom Petty, the singer and
songwriter who connected

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,350
California rock to a
deep southern heritage,

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,070
died in Los Angeles.

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,610

[MUSIC - TOM PETTY]

10
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,240
He rose to fame with
the Heartbreakers,

11
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,880
the band he formed
in the mid-1970s.

12
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,770
With them and on his
own, he wrote pithy,

13
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,150
hardheaded songs that gave 1960s
roots a contemporary polish.

14
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,101
His voice was grainy, and he had
a Florida drawl that he never

15
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:31,600
hid.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,980
[MUSIC - TOM PETTY]

17
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,590

rock radio through decades,

00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,560
with hits like "Refugee," "Don't
Come Around Here No More,"

19
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,560
"Free Fallin'," "Into
the Great Wide Open,"

20
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,010
and "American Girl."

21
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,070
He sold millions of albums and
headlined arenas and festivals

22
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:45,896
well into 2017.

23
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:48,520
[MUSIC - TOM PETTY - "AMERICAN
 GIRL"] Well she was an American

24
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,500
girl.

25
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,560
In the late 1980s he joined
Bob Dylan, George Harrison,

26
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,290
Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne
to form the tongue in cheek

27
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,829
supergroup called The
Traveling Wilburys,

28
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,370
which released two
successful albums.

Everybody's got
somebody to lean on.

31
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,170
In 2014, Tom Petty and
the Heartbreakers released

32
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,850
their 13th studio album.

33
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,550
I'm really excited this time,
because I know I really got

34
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,290
something [LAUGHS]

35
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,870
It was called "Hypnotic Eye,"
and it entered at number one

36
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,360
on the Billboard charts,
becoming the first chart-topper

37
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,880
in the band's 38-year history.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

39
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,390
Regardless of fame, his
songs stayed down-to-earth,

40
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,599
with sturdy guitar riffs and
lyrics that spoke for underdogs

41
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,140
and outcasts.

42
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,190
[MUSIC - TOM PETTY - "I WON'T
 BACK DOWN"] I won't back down.
