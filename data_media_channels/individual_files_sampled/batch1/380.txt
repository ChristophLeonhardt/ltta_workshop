exactly a decade ago the world was hit by the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression in the u.s. trillions of dollars were sucked out of the global economy tens of millions of people lost their jobs and austerity economics was imposed across many countries here at The Listening Post were reported back then on the failings of the financial coverage failings that meant the crash came as a huge surprise to many around the world the financial press cheered on a bubble that eventually burst showed a lack of skepticism about Wall Street claims and failed to expose what was in effect mass fraud on their own beat namely the myth selling of mortgages to millions of Americans in the aftermath some outlets apologized for the shortcomings in their reporting at 10 years old how much has actually changed the listening-posts Meenakshi Ravi now on the lessons of 2008 in the new challenges facing reporters on the business and economy beats today right now breaking news here stocks all around the world are taking because of the crisis on Wall Street 2008 was a year of recommend for governments regulators financial institutions and the journalists who reported on them it was like a war zone think about it the institutions that had been around since the Great Depression Bear Stearns Lehman Brothers Merrill Lynch for all intents and purposes disappeared during this crisis there's the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America and word of trouble with the world's largest insurance company American International Group most of what drove the financial crisis was not concealed by some dastardly James Bond style plot most of it was just widely ignored by the public and politicians and most journalists you know this shakes your core this shakes your trust in American institutions most of the coverage leading up to the crash ignored the the really central problems which was that fraud and predatory tactics were rife and they were really over the crash critical we are of financial journalism it molded itself around a system that was unsustainable that was its failure but let us never forget that it was malfeasance miscalculation and miss regulation that caused the problem in the years leading up to the financial crash global stock markets hit new highs real estate was booming investment banks used ever more complicated financial instruments primarily collateralized debt obligations CDOs and credit default swaps CVS's they're not only enabled riskier and riskier mortgages to be given but allowed banks to make more and more money off them when people started to default on mass the banks found themselves in too deep in a world in which banks relied on borrowing from each other for survival it set off a domino effect before 2007 and eight very few mainstream financial outlets were looking at the world of complex credit and derivatives and subprime mortgages and debt I wrote about it a firm out myself because I became absolutely fascinated by the question of what on earth are the geeks doing in these dark corners we don't understand most journalists thought that those kind of areas of finance were boring and technical and dull and you couldn't get on the front page of a newspaper you couldn't get it on the top of the running of his television show so that whole world got totally ignored financial journalists in particular began to understand that all the nuance and the end the details of these incredibly complex instruments mattered but at the same time if you were out there saying oh my god watch out for CBS's watch out for CDOs you were treated like somebody wearing a tinfoil hat you were not considered somebody who understood finance probing the culture of the financial press is central to any critical examination of its performance in the years after the crash critics on the outside and voices from inside the newsrooms pointed out some of the most problematic aspects of how the financial media operates hey Warren they cited groupthink a reliance on access to industry insiders and crucially a sense that financial reporters have to be as enthused about the bottom lines of the companies they report on as the businesses executives themselves it's like covering a sports team you have a tendency and start cheering because it's more exciting to cover something where there's lots of money rolling around and profits are high and by defining it that way you're really sort of limiting your scope of vision you know how are consumers treated what are the checks and balances within the company those kind of things often are forgotten if a company's doing well if a market is booming it's very easy to just sort of let the good times roll one of the really big things that happened around the start of 21st century was it television in the financial world of markets became much more important it's much easier to convey a sense of manic excitement through a television studio interview than it is in the pages of a newspaper or a wire service it's fair to say that people like me who questioned the system and the sustainability of the boom well we won't show to them but you will look Tom as a kind of unnecessary trouble maker there was a cultural pressure to say well if the great and good saying goes on forever it goes on forever especially because in the background you've got these relentless channels of kind of one-dimensional weird propaganda for the bottom line you know the American business channels it's easy to get sucked into their world there's a question to be asked about audiences and how their interests shape journalistic output the financial press is consumed in large part by a niche group traders investors bankers and CEOs what's good news for them say for instance company mergers or credit bubbles are often reported positively by the financial press what often goes underreported are wider impacts and concerns this can be contagious because so many mainstream outlets take their cues on business and financial reporting from the specialist press and then there's the question of sources business journalists rely on their relationships with the executives they report on for stories access is priceless when you go to your annual shareholder meetings like you get a standing ovation for what you've done there is a careful balance of being able to get the CEO to come back on your channel and being able to get the CEO to give you some news I don't think that in my experience of either Bloomberg or CNBC we ever pulled punches we worked really hard to actually give difficult interviews you need to ask the question in a way that isn't rude because the viewers will immediately think you're being awful to this guest that you've invited on your show in the aftermath of the financial crisis there's been a lot of introspection by the media journalists had to face the failings of their work before 2008 and reassess their approach to the finance and economy beats there's still work to be done the media is still very obsessed with the issues that create the last crisis the one thing we can count on is that the next crisis won't come from exactly the same era it will be something else like what's happening with the pension system today what's happening with say exchange-traded funds what's happening with other areas of financial technology FinTech plus there are other areas of our life where you have once again geeks in control of a technology that no one else understands I think that the financial media has become a bit more skeptical post-2008 but I wouldn't say that there's been a massive culture change not thinking about the health of society health of a nation how well customers are being treated that's really kind of a secondary thing so that does wear me but that says there has been some really good reporting the Los Angeles Times did great reporting breaking the Wells Fargo fake account scandal but in general there are a lot of financial stories out there that aren't getting the kind of digging investigative reporting that they merit I think there is a strategic mismatch between much of journalism and the kind of world that we live in business journalism cannot be like sports journalist it has to ask the question should this match even be being played to the rules it's being played sports journalism cannot ask that of a football match we must ask that of a banking system are the rules right other players or creeps is the game futile is it destroying the society we live in
