MELANIA THING FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE WE’VE TOUCHED ON IT WITH

6
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:10,567
BECAUSE WE’VE TOUCHED ON IT WITH KID GLOVES.

7
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,403
KID GLOVES. THIS WAS AN UNFORGIVABLE MOMENT

8
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:14,771

9
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:15,472
FOR THE FIRST LADY AND THE FIRST FAMILY, NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT

FAMILY, NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE INITIAL MOMENT

11
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,577

WHERE, WHY DID SHE WEAR THIS? FRANKLY I WAS ONE WHO DISMISSED

16
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,319
BUT TO WEAR IT ON HER RETURN AFFIRMED SHE WAS MAKING A

17
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:29,820
AFFIRMED SHE WAS MAKING A POLITICAL MESSAGE.

18
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,021
POLITICAL MESSAGE. THIS WAS NOT A FASHION MESSAGE.

19
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,055
THIS WAS NOT A FASHION MESSAGE. THIS WAS A POLITICAL MESSAGE

20
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,323
THIS WAS A POLITICAL MESSAGE WHERE SHE SAID, I DON’T CARE.

21
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:34,825
WHERE SHE SAID, I DON’T CARE. AND I DON’T CARE PERSONALLY AS

WHERE HER HUSBAND HAS RIPPED FAMILIES APART WEARING A JACKET
