1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,509
I remember sitting down with Bill in
Paris a couple of years ago where the

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,240
world was coming together to hammer out
an agreement a small agreement to save

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,850
the planet by taking meaningful action
to tackle climate change it's a threat

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,439
that may define the contours of this
century more than just about anything

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,920
else
here was the interesting thing bill saw

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,130
this not simply as a challenge but also
as an opportunity and I remember him in

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,450
sort of a matter-of-fact way saying well
we're going to just have to go ahead and

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,640
invent some new technologies which I
said I agree let's do that although he

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,879
knows more than me about inventing new
technologies but his tone was yes this

10
00:00:50,879 --> 00:01:00,899
is hard but we can figure it out it's
hard but it can be done and that spirit

11
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:08,900
a spirit that says to quote I guess
myself yes we can

12
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:23,460
that spirit rather than a spirit of
despair is is the motor by which we've

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,230
been able to see real progress in
reducing the pace of carbon emission

14
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:34,020
increases here in the US and even if at
the current moment the federal

15
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,770
government is not as engaged in these
efforts as I would like nevertheless

16
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,460
progress continues because of the
efforts of people like tho and a whole

17
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,690
host of entrepreneurs and universities
and cities and states they are making

18
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:57,530
change around energy policy in America
separate in the park from what

19
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,610
government is doing and that gives me
confidence that we can continue to make

20
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:09,720
progress and my broader point here is is
that you tend to believe when Bill says

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,510
we can do something that we can do it
and when all of you stand up and say

22
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:22,410
this is something we can do that spirit
is infectious and it's exactly what we

23
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,560
need right now we do face extraordinary
challenges you've heard of many of them

24
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,480
in your discussions today you know the
nature of these challenges from your

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:41,280
work growing economic inequality that
changing climate terrorism mass

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,410
migration still too much extreme poverty
still too many girls who are denied an

27
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:56,760
education the rise of nationalism and
xenophobia and a pop of politics that

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:04,350
says it's not we but us and men the
politics that threatens to turn good

29
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,120
people away from the kind of collective
action that has always driven human

30
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,640
progress so these are real challenges
and we can't sugarcoat them they're

31
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,430
going to take a long time to solve but
that can't discourage any of us from the

32
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:26,400
belief that individually and
collectively we can make a difference we

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,540
can make things better
and rather than be daunted by those

34
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,760
challenges those challenges should
inspire us and excite us because it

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,370
gives us an opportunity to make our mark
on the world and in ways that we haven't

36
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,920
even yet scratched the surface of we
have to reject the notion that we're

37
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,600
suddenly gripped by forces that we
cannot control we've got to embrace the

38
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,900
longer and more optimistic view of
history and the part that we play in it

39
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,390
and if you are skeptical of such
optimism I will say something that may

40
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:08,160
sound controversial I used to say this
to my staff and the White House young

41
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,770
interns who would come in any group of
young people that I met with and that is

42
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:23,010
that by just about every measure America
is better and the world is better than

43
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:31,050
it was 50 years ago 30 years ago or even
10 years ago and I know that statement

44
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,990
doesn't jibe with the steady stream of
bad news and cynicism that were fed

45
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:44,190
through television and Twitter but think
about it I was born I mean I I know I

46
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,590
have gray hair but I don't consider
myself that old but I was born in a time

47
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:58,190
when women and people of color were
systematically routinely excluded from

48
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:05,130
enormous portions of American life
today women and minorities have risen up

49
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,460
the ranks of business and politics and
everywhere else and even if we still

50
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:18,330
have miles to travel and innumerable
laws and hearts and minds to change the

51
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:27,720
shift in what this country is and what
it means is astonishing remarkable and

52
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,110
it's happened when you measure it
against the scope of human history in an

53
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:40,680
instant just since I graduated from
college crime rates teen birth rates

54
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,760
drop
rates the share of people living in

55
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,290
poverty have dropped and in some cases
dropped dramatically the share of

56
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,440
Americans with college education is up
despite a massive global recession in

57
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,480
the final years of my presidency the
uninsured rate reached a new low median

58
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,720
household income reached a new high
that's here in the United States

59
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,440
worldwide our progress is even more
remarkable and bill can rattle off these

60
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,060
statistics better than I can
but over the past 100 years we've come

61
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,670
from a world where only a small fraction
of women could vote - a world where

62
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:27,110
almost every woman can since the 1950s
the global average life expectancy has

63
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:33,050
grown by more than 20 years since 1990
we have cut extreme poverty and

64
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,410
childhood mortality in half keep in mind
I was in law school in 1990 it seems

65
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:45,520
like yesterday since 2000 we've evolved
from a world without marriage equality

66
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,520
to one where it's a reality of more than
two dozen countries all of this has

67
00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:01,820
happened in such a steady march that
sometimes we have intensity to take it

68
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,310
for granted but I often ask when I meet
with young people if you had to choose

69
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:15,130
any moment in history in which to be
born and you didn't know in advance

70
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,910
whether you were going to be male or
female what country you are gonna be

71
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:27,620
from what your status was you choose
right now because the world has never

72
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:35,330
been healthier or wealthier or better
educated or in many ways more tolerant

73
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:41,720
or less violent than it is today fewer
people are dying young more people are

74
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,130
living not only longer but better more
girls are in school and more adults can

75
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:53,180
read more children get the vaccines that
they need despite the enormous conflicts

76
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,280
that break our hearts around the world
it's demonstrable that fewer people are

77
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,700
being killed in wars and conflicts than
ever before this would be the time you'd

78
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:13,430
want to be showing up on this planet and
these trends are real they do not make

79
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,510
us complacent but they should spur us to
action because it shows

80
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,700
despite the naysay them the naysayers
and the cynicism that in fact change can

81
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,950
happen they're not the result of
mysterious forces of chance they happen

82
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:34,580
because countless people like you
toiling for many years chose to make

83
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:40,750
this progress some like Bill and Melinda
have enormous wealth and influence

84
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,760
others like Justin Trudeau who I knows
addressed you earlier have formal

85
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,900
political offices but the majority of
people who made these advances we're

86
00:08:52,900 --> 00:09:04,610
citizens doctors nurses entrepreneurs
clergy moms community leaders activists

87
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:11,470
union leaders who mobilized and
organized and voted and innovated and

88
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:17,780
pushed for change and by the way they
knew at every step of the way that they

89
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:23,450
would not get everything they wanted as
fast as they wanted they knew that

90
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,730
progress required struggle and
perseverance and discipline and faith

91
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,060
they knew that sometimes for every two
steps forward you'll take a step back

92
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:40,430
but they made things better and this is
something I always had to emphasize to

93
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:46,030
my staff when I was president better is
good

94
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:56,750
you laugh but sometimes people forget
that I will take better every time so

95
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,580
that's what's needed today the
engagement of everyone who wants to see

96
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,370
a better future for our children and it
can be frustrating I'll take an example

97
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,900
here in the United States over the past
eight years thousands upon thousands of

98
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,350
Americans threw themselves into the
collective effort of reforming our

99
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,870
health care system those of you who live
in countries that already have the

100
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:26,750
universal health care are trying to
figure out what's the controversy here I

101
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:32,140
am too these people

102
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:43,250
but you know the folks who did the work
it wasn't just policy wonks it wasn't

103
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:51,860
just politicians it was moms and dads
people who had the experience of a sick

104
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:59,210
child or crushing medical bills that
threatened to bankrupt them maybe a

105
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,280
parent who was lost to cancer that had
that person got a regular checkup it

106
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:11,360
might have been caught earlier and those
voices from every walk of life in every

107
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,590
court of the country against all odds
made a difference and for the first time

108
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:22,220
more than 90% of Americans know the
security of health insurance paying more

109
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,240
for insurance or being denied insurance
because of a pre-existing condition or

110
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,150
because you are a woman that's not a
thing anymore we got rid of that and

111
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:39,350
people are alive today because of it and
that's progress now the legislation that

112
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:47,090
we passed was full of things that still
need to be fixed it wasn't perfect but

113
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:52,400
it was better and so when I see people
trying to undo that hard-won progress

114
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,130
for the 50th or 60th time with bills
that would raise costs or reduce

115
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,300
coverage or roll back protections for
older Americans or people with

116
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,520
pre-existing conditions the cancer
survivor' the expecting mom or the child

117
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:15,610
with autism or asthma for whom coverage
once again would be almost unattainable

118
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,500
it is aggravating and all of this being
done without any demonstrable economic

119
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:31,400
or actuarial or plain common-sense
rationale it it frustrates and it's

120
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,750
certainly frustrating to have to
mobilize every couple of months to keep

121
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:42,520
our leaders from inflicting real human
suffering on our constituents but

122
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:49,970
typically that's how progress is won and
how progress is maintained on every

123
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,970
issue
we have to stand up for each other

124
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:59,709
recognize that progress is never
inevitable that it often can be fragile

125
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:06,800
it's in need of constant renewal and our
individual progress and our collective

126
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:15,290
progress depends on our willingness to
roll up our sleeves and work and not be

127
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:27,140
afraid to work so in conclusion each of
us can make a difference and I know I'm

128
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:33,649
preaching to the choir cuz otherwise you
wouldn't be a goalkeeper but many of you

129
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:42,649
are young and maybe have only seen
forward momentum and may not have seen

130
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:49,100
backward momentum yet many of you may
confront hurdles and roadblocks and

131
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:59,480
disappointments in the future and when
that happens that's the test the test is

132
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:07,130
not how do you feel when things are
going good or when you are at a cool

133
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:12,610
conference in New York with Bill and
Melinda Gates and will.i.am

134
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,170
right the test is when you're in the
field and you're on the ground and you

135
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:24,050
are doing work and people are resisting
or misunderstanding or purposely

136
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,540
undermining efforts that you know can
make a difference and how do you respond

137
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:35,649
to that and what I'm suggesting here
today is is that your response has to be

138
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:44,120
to reject cynicism and reject pessimism
and push forward with a a certain

139
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,850
infectious and relentless optimism not
blind optimism not one that ignores the

140
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,560
scale and the scope of challenges but
that hard-earned optimism that's rooted

141
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,480
in the stories of very real progress
that have occurred throughout human

142
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,770
history and the recognition that our
successes even

143
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:11,800
though sometimes they're small or
incomplete accumulate they built and

144
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:21,380
they create a trajectory that's better
and will mean some girl somewhere

145
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,270
getting an education that otherwise she
would have been that'll mean some farmer

146
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:32,900
being able to cultivate a crop to feed
his family and if enough of them do it

147
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:39,350
feed a nation that's what you're
fighting for at every moment because

148
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:45,640
each new generation stands on the
successes of the previous generation

149
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,080
there's like a relay race that we're
running each generation reaches up

150
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,600
standing on that previous generation and
bends that arc of history in the

151
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,130
direction of more freedom and more
opportunity and more justice that's why

152
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:06,860
I spend so much time when I was
president convening young leaders on

153
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,690
every continent that I visited that's
why in my post presidency my emphasis is

154
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,470
going to be on training the next
generation of leaders to take their own

155
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,220
crack at changing the world
through the Obama foundation which will

156
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,420
be based in Chicago but we'll have
projects and programs and digital

157
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,010
networks all across the global and I'm
hoping I get a chance to work with some

158
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,810
of you because I have great faith in you
this is I know Bill and Melinda have

159
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:38,540
great faith in you and I'm certain that
if you keep pushing forward then America

160
00:16:38,540 --> 00:00:00,000
and the world are going to be just fine
thank you very much
