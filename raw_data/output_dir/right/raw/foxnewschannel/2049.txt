1
00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:00,676
DEVELOPMENT.

2
00:00:00,676 --> 00:00:02,577
I'M GOING TO BRING IT UP NOW

3
00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:03,845
WITH MY NEXT GUEST.

4
00:00:03,845 --> 00:00:05,347
BENJAMIN HALL, THANK YOU VERY

5
00:00:05,347 --> 00:00:06,181
MUCH.

6
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:08,083
HIS REPORT EXCELLENT THERE.

7
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,284
HARRY, THE DECK TERROR OF THE

8
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:11,053
DEFENSE STUDIES AT THE STUDY

9
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,120
FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST.

10
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,954
THIS IS TROUBLING.

11
00:00:12,954 --> 00:00:14,556
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE REGIONAL

12
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,058
CONCERNS INTO THE WHOLE VISION

13
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:16,458
HERE.

14
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,460
WHERE DOES THIS PUT THE UNITED

15
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:18,827
STATES?

16
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:20,128
I MEAN OUR PRESIDENT IS STRONG

17
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:21,363
ON THIS ISSUE.

18
00:00:21,363 --> 00:00:23,298
IF ISRAEL IS IN FURTHER

19
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:25,133
DANGER, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

20
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:27,402
>> WELL, HARRIS, I HAVE A GOOD

21
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,837
IDEA THAT THE IRAN DEAL IS

22
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:29,471
PROBABLY DEAD.

23
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:30,906
I THINK THE ONLY QUESTION HERE

24
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,841
IS WHAT DATE YOU STAMP ON THE

25
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:33,442
TOMBSTONE.

26
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:34,409
I THINK THE TRUMP

27
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,610
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN PRETTY

28
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,379
CLEAR FROM REALLY SINCE THE

29
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:39,614
CAMPAIGN THAT THIS ISN'T A

30
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:40,382
DEAL THEY LIKE.

31
00:00:40,382 --> 00:00:42,017
IT'S OBVIOUS WHY THEY DON'T

32
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:42,484
LIKE IT.

33
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:43,985
IN FACT, BORIS JOHNSON

34
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:45,854
PROBABLY MADE THE CASE ON "FOX

35
00:00:45,854 --> 00:00:48,223
& FRIENDS" WHY WE SHOULD LEAVE

36
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:48,790
THE DEAL.

37
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,725
>> Harris: EXACTLY.

38
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:51,059
>> SUNSET PROVISION, IRAN GETS

39
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,661
TO LEAVE THE DEAL IN 2025.

40
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,129
DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND IRAN

41
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:56,198
IS GOING TO TRY TO RENEGOTIATE

42
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:57,365
A NEW DEAL THEN.

43
00:00:57,365 --> 00:00:58,600
THEY WILL PROBABLY SPRINT TO

44
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,601
BUILD NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOR THE

45
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,004
SAME REASONS THE NORTH KOREANS

46
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:04,004
HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BECAUSE

47
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:05,774
IT GUARANTEES THEIR SECURITY.

48
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,808
IRANIANS WERE SMART IN THE

49
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:08,210
DEAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

50
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,344
IS NO RESTRICTION ON ABILITY

51
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:10,712
FOR THEM TO BUILD MISSILES.

52
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:12,080
DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND THAT

53
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,783
THE IRANIANS AREN'T GETTING

54
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,684
TECHNOLOGY FROM THE NORTH

55
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:18,253
KOREANS THEY CAN BUY TO BUILD

56
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:19,387
ICBMs AND MAKE THEM WITH A

57
00:01:19,387 --> 00:01:20,489
NUCLEAR WEAPON IN THE FUTURE.

58
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,124
ALL OF THIS IS FAKES NEWS AND

59
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,191
FAKE DEBATE THAT THE DEAL IS

60
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:23,625
DEAD.

61
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,459
>> Harris: YOU KNOW IT'S

62
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,260
INTERESTING BECAUSE I WATCHED

63
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,561
THAT INTERVIEW WITH BORIS

64
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:28,263
JOHNSON AND I KIND OF HAD A

65
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:30,065
SIMILAR TAKE-AWAY AS YOU ARE

66
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:32,667
DESCRIBING THAT HE WAS KIND OF

67
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:33,668
ENUMERATING WHY WE SHOULD EXIT

68
00:01:33,668 --> 00:01:34,736
THE DEAL.

69
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:36,371
HARRY D YOU THINK IT'S BEEN

70
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,405
FACTORED IN ALREADY, IN

71
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:38,540
EUROPE, THAT HEY, THE UNITED

72
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,708
STATES IS GOING TO STEP AWAY

73
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,911
AND THAT IS WHAT I WE HEARD

74
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:44,579
FROM ROUHANI TODAY?

75
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,882
THAT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE WOULD

76
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:47,949
CONSIDER STAYING IN THE DEAL

77
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:49,050
EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES

78
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,484
EXITS?

79
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,786
>> I THINK SO.

80
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:52,387
ROUHANI AND THE EUROPEANS

81
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:53,922
COULD HAVE THEIR OWN SIDE DEAL

82
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:54,823
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

83
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,258
BUT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO

84
00:01:56,258 --> 00:01:57,325
REMEMBER, HARRIS, THE UNITED

85
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,627
STATES IS THE ONE WHO REALLY

86
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:00,295
HAS THE BALL IN ITS COURT.

87
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:02,297
IF WE DECIDE TO SCRAP THE DEAL

88
00:02:02,297 --> 00:02:05,167
AND WE IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THE

89
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,968
IRANIANS AGAIN, THE IRANIANS

90
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:08,136
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HERE.

91
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:09,070
THERE IS PRESSURE ON THE

92
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,472
ECONOMY.

93
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:12,140
THEY ARE ALREADY UNDER INTENSE

94
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,808
DOMESTIC PROBLEMS.

95
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:14,109
THEY HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF

96
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:15,710
DIFFERENT RIOTS AND CHALLENGES

97
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,778
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS.

98
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:18,647
IN FACT, THERE IS MORE RIOTS

99
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,549
TODAY IN DIFFERENT PART OF THE

100
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:20,982
COUNTRY.

101
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:22,417
PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT WAGES

102
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:24,319
AND THE ECONOMIC FUTURE.

103
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,454
I THINK IN A LOT OF RESPECTS,

104
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:28,723
A LOT OF IRANIANS ARE WAKING

105
00:02:28,723 --> 00:02:30,225
UP TO THE FACT THE REGIME IS

106
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:31,226
NOT KEEPING THE PROMISE IT

107
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:33,361
MADE IN THE LAST 20, 30, 40

108
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:33,695
YEARS.

109
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,563
I THINK PEOPLE THERE ARE

110
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:35,597
STARTING TO WAKE UP.

111
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:36,932
IRAN HAS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT

112
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:40,569
WHAT IT IS TRYING TO DO.

113
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:42,070
>> Harris: IT IS SO

114
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,371
INTERESTING TO HEAR YOU SET A

115
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,341
BAR IN THAT COUNTRY FOR A

116
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:46,775
DICTATORSHIP.

117
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,476
I EXPECT THE BAR TO BE LOW

118
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:48,810
ANYWAY.

119
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,312
I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE STAND

120
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:51,613
ALONG THE ROADWAY SAYING THEY

121
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:52,714
ARE NOT KEEPING THEIR PROMISES

122
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,815
BUT I HEAR YOU.

123
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:55,417
CAN'T WE TALK A LITTLE BIT, I

124
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:57,586
WANT TO GET BACK TO WHAT

125
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:59,120
BENJAMIN HALL WAS TELLING US

126
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,388
ABOUT A FEW MOMENTS AGO.

127
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,623
IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN AN ALLY

128
00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:03,191
BUT A FRIEND IN ISRAEL HEARS

129
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,860
FROM IRAN WE ARE GETTING READY

130
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,827
TO ATTACK YOU.

131
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:07,696
ON MAY 12, THERE IS A DEADLINE

132
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:09,064
THAT THE PRESIDENT MAY

133
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,166
DECERTIFY THE IRAN DEAL.

134
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,601
TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW THE

135
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:13,401
COMPONENT GOES TOGETHER AND

136
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,872
WHAT WE MAY NEED TO DO TO

137
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:18,840
REASSURE ISRAEL.

138
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,475
>> IF THE IRANIANS THOUGHT

139
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:21,910
ABOUT ATTACK ISRAELI TERRITORY

140
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,979
IN A KINETIC STRIKE THAT IS

141
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,780
ATTRIBUTED 100% TO IRAN, THAT

142
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,815
WOULD BE NEAR SUICIDE FOR A

143
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:29,184
LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS.

144
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:30,986
FIRST, WHAT THE ISRAELIS WOULD

145
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:32,487
DO IS SAY WELL, THERE IS NO

146
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:33,321
RESTRICTIONS ON US ANYMORE

147
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:36,658
FROM ATTACKING IRAN'S NUCLEAR

148
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:38,293
PROGRAM AND THEY WOULD

149
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:38,994
PROBABLY WIPE OUT LARGE

150
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:40,395
SECTIONS OF IT.

151
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:42,697
I DON'T THINK IT'S IN THE

152
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:43,231
IRANIAN'S INTEREST.

153
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:46,034
A LOT OF TIMES THE IRANIANS

154
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:47,335
TALK BIG AND THEY HAVE THE

155
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:51,439
GRAND -- GRANDIOSE VISION OF

156
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,043
WHAT THEY CAN DO BUT THEY ARE

157
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:55,777
ROGUE STATE.

158
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,078
BUT IT WOULD ACTUALLY OPEN UP

159
00:03:57,078 --> 00:04:00,015
A PANDORA'S BOX FOR THEM AND

160
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:00,916
ISRAEL WOULD STRIKE

161
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:01,783
AGGRESSIVELY AND THE UNITED

162
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,385
STATES WOULD PROBABLY BACK

163
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:05,587
THAT UP AND SELL ISRAEL ALL

164
00:04:05,587 --> 00:04:07,422
THE BEST BUNKER-BUSTING BOMBS

165
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:08,990
AND THINGS TO DO DAMAGE TO

166
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,591
IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

167
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:11,159
IT WOULD BE A BIG MISTAKE.

168
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,527
>> Harris: I WAS FASCINATED

169
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:14,195
BY WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT WHY

170
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,830
IRAN MIGHT DO A SIDE DEAL WITH

171
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,065
OTHER COUNTRIES.

172
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:18,833
IT'S ABOUT SECURITY BUT IT'S

173
00:04:18,833 --> 00:00:00,000
ALSO ABOUT MONEY.
