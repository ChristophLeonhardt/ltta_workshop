a lot of it is a result of routine interactions escalating and for something much more environment and scary we all have a responsibility to try to keep situations as calm as possible police officers are the professionals it should be up to them to be trained and comfortable in the escalating situation and so it becomes very important for those officers to understand how to approach someone such that they're not creating more tension than an already do I also think that there has to be a recognition among law enforcement that learning how to interact with people who may be in some kind of mental health crisis is also important many of the incidents we've seen over the last few years the police officers are encountering people who are having some sort of mental health issue police officers and police departments have to get a better grip on how to handle those situations now that being said we're probably after in police departments to do too much I think there has to be some collaboration between police departments and mental health professionals to figure out better ways to respond to incidents where people are in crisis the other thing I would mention is accountability it's one thing to you know have these incidents on tape and to have evidence that bad things are happening between police and community members it's another thing to actually hold those officers accountable and as we've seen a lot of the frustration and tension has more to do with the response of the judicial system than it does would be the actual incident officers are not being held accountable in the same way that civilians are but there have to be real consequences and criminal prosecution is appropriate then that should be one of the things that police officers have to have to face just like anyone else
