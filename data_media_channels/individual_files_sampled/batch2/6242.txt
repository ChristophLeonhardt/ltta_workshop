following an internal memo questioning Google's gender policy an engineer who released that memo has been fired and Google promised to have a company-wide meeting to address the issue of gender in the workplace now unfortunately that dialogue will not happen at least not yet because google has canceled this employee meeting because of fears that participants would be harassed online so on Thursday Google's chief executive sent an email to staff members canceling the meeting a half hour before it was to start in fact he released a statement saying that we had hoped to have a frank open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward but our Dory questions appeared externally this afternoon and on some websites Googlers are now being named personally Googlers are writing in concerned about their safety and worried they may be outed publicly for asking a question so they are postponing this company why talk but I think that this dialogue is incredibly important to have and you know it's unfortunate that people are getting harassed but welcome to the internet Google we're gonna rest ironic that you never welcome Google to the Internet so let's talk about a couple of other angles here so what Breitbart unveil revealed was some employees talking about plan to blacklist people who did not support the company's diversity efforts so that could be problematic and I understand why they would want to cover that as news now it's a it's entirely different thing when you then start daxing people and saying okay let's find out who those people are they're in and talk of consequences and and then this thing gets shut down because whoever's asking the questions are the people that they want to reveal their identities and that's again we're getting into madness there when you when you go in that direction you won't have a battle of ideas let's have at it Hoss so let's have a conversation and a debate but why do you need to know who they are and where they live and so it's just that's deeply problematic and then they cancel them the meeting in the meeting that we're going to talk about three different things and one was how they did not have to lower status for hiring women and minorities and they wanted to explain that you would think you'd want to hear them out on that is that true you might be skeptical but you'd want to hear what they had to say right and then and one other thing that they wanted to talk about was who do are we making political conservatives feel unwelcome at Google that seems like that's a conversation you won't you would want them to have but now they're not gonna have that conversation because you threatened to out the identities of people you disagree with I mean they might have the conversation further down the line but I would have much preferred for them to have that conversation now because it's more relevant now than ever before and look I that's the thing that drives me crazy right so abusing people threatening people getting in their way when they want to share their ideas or their concerns is an issue just let people have an open and frank dialogue without having to worry about them getting docstore or being met with any type of violence or threat I just that's the reason why we never have any type of progress when it comes to these issues because people are afraid to speak out whether you're on the right or the left on this on this issue and I just want to clarify one thing Breitbart didn't threaten violence but they did out this memo which again I think it does have some news value but at one Twitter accounts said let's find out who they are and quote ruin their lives now again if you're on the internet that kind of talk was fairly commonplace but still disconcerting and especially if you're not a person who is used to being attacked online and you're just a civilian and all of a sudden somebody's talking about ruining your life it's it's problematic so yeah I don't want to put it necessarily on Breitbart but it is a reason why Google would be seriously concerned about the safety of their employees well this is a tactic that unfortunately let's be real has been has been frequently invoked by the right using daxing to harass people and put theirs personal safety in extreme danger and they ran off what's her name Lesley from Saturday Night Live off of Twitter by doxxing same thing that Milo was doing with potentially undocumented students at Berkeley so that kind of tactic is is reprehensible right and like you just said it's gonna actually prevent the conversation and the the other thing that I will mention though and this might be an unpopular opinion I don't think they should have fired the guy I agree with you I I think they should have lowered his pain leadership position and to see if he could tolerate stress right like that was it's like see if he'd be know that have an erotic reaction but it's interesting because bribe are called like the headline for this was social justice warriors create wrong think and of course they're trying to riff off of the Orwellian concept of doublethink and people not being able to think for themselves and only like political conservatives I guess can think for themselves in an environment that that embraces ideological diversity but again like you just said they just prevented that by putting people's lives at danger yes yes so I think it's an important conversation and it's super ironic that if you thought it was wrong to fired amore because he was trying to have a conversation you have now blocked the conversation that Google was going to have about it right so and and I think it is a fair argument and we've debated this on the show all week about what should what Google should have done with DES Mori but I think your valid point of view is that he created a hostile work environment just thinking about it as Susan Wojcicki talked about what if it was another category instead of women it was some and she didn't say this but I lied it if he had said now look let's just be honest about the biological differences of Jews there's no question he gets fired right everybody agrees I mean we've we the world has lived through that that didn't end well so now I don't want to say that we should never have a conversation about the biological differences of women but I don't know that if especially if you're a boss to make this point if you're supervising anyone if does those are your views about a certain group you're supervising that could be problematic if you
