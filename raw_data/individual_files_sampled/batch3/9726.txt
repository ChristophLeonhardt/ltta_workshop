I BELIEVE HER. TO BE PREPARED TO TESTIFY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AGAINST SOMEONE WHO IS BEING NOMINATED TO ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL POSITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, THAT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF COURAGE. NOT ONLY DO WOMEN, LIKE DR. FORD WHO BRAVELY COMES FORWARD NEED TO BE HEARD, BUT THEY NEED TO BE BELIEVED. I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THE MEN OF THIS COUNTRY JUST SHUT UP AND STEP UP. DO THE RIGHT THING. I BELIEVE DR. FORD. I BELIEVE THE SURVIVOR HERE. I BELIEVE HER. I STAND WITH HER. I BELIEVE PROFESSOR FORD. I THINK SHE'S CREDIBLE. ANNA: HAVEN'T HAD THE HEARING YET. STEVE: PROMINENT DEMOCRATS TALKING ABOUT THE ACCUSER OF JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH. JOINING US NOW WE ARE HEAR TO HAVE SARAH SANDERS THE PRESS SECRETARY FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES YOU ARE IN TOWN FOR THE UNITED NATIONS. GOOD TO SEE NEW REAL LIFE. KELLYANNE'S SWEEPER NOT BEHIND US STEVE SO QUIET IN HERE. BRIAN: NO ONE MOWING THE LAWN. STEVE: REGARDING THE ACCUSERS AND THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH. SHE DESCRIBED IT AS A VAST LEFT WING CONSPIRACY. DO YOU THINK THERE IS ONE? I THINK THE PROCESS THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE PLAYED HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY APPALLING AND DISGUSTING. EVEN IN THE ACCUSER'S LETTER YESTERDAY TO SENATOR GRASSLEY, SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO DO THIS PRIVATELY AND SHE REACHED OUT FOR THAT PURPOSE. BUT, BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO PLAY 11TH HOUR POLITICAL GAMES, THEY WAITED UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE. THEY HAVE MADE THIS A HUGE PUBLIC CIRCUS AND FRANKLY HURT TWO DIFFERENT FAMILIES' LIVES THAT THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO BE THE SAME BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE OPERATED THIS PROCESS AND I THINK IT'S DISGUSTING THAT THEY HAVE EXPLOITED THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL PURPOSES. BRIAN: WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE ON MARCH THAT'S INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT AND WHAT WENT INTO THE DECISION TO DO THAT INTERVIEW BECAUSE THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS BEEN UNIQUE. THAT WAS A VERY TOUGH DECISION I IMAGINE FROM COMMUNICATIONS. I THINK WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING. JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS WANTED TO COME OUT AND TELL HIS STORY. BRIAN: HE HAS BEEN TELLING YOU THAT? I MEAN, HE SAID IT IN EVERY LETTER, EVERY EXCHANGE, EVERY STATEMENT THAT HE IS WILLING AND READY TO COME AND ANSWER QUESTIONS, HARD QUESTIONS, UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN VERY CONSISTENT FROM DAY ONE AND UNEQUIVOCAL IN HIS DENIAL THAT ANYTHING EVER TOOK PLACE. I FIND IT TO BE A GOOD PLATFORM THAT HE WAS ABLE TO COME OUT AND TO SHARE HIS SIDE OF THE STORY BECAUSE, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL AND AS FAR AS I REMEMBER IN AMERICA, YOU ARE STILL INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. BUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN CALLING HIM GUILTY FROM DAY ONE BEFORE THEY EVER EVEN TALKED TO HIM. THEY SET THROUGH HOURS OF HEARINGS, NEVER BROUGHT IT UP. NEVER TALKED TO HIM IN PRIVATE MEETINGS AND WAITED UNTIL THE LAST ANYONE TO START THROWING OUT SOME OUTRAGEOUS ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE NO CORROBORATION WHICH I FIND REALLY TERRIBLE. ANNA: A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND THE TIMING CURIOUS. WE DO WANT OUR VIEWERS TO BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAD TO SAY DENYING THE ACCUSATIONS TALKING TO MARTHA MACCALLUM ON "THE STORY." IN AMERICA, WE HAVE FAIRNESS, WE HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES. A FAIR PROCESS AT A MINIMUM, AT A BEAR MINIMUM REQUIRES HEARING FROM BOTH SIDES BEFORE RUSHING TO JUDGMENT. PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE HAD TOO MANY BEERS ON OCCASION AND PEOPLE GENERALLY IN HIGH SCHOOL, I THINK ALL OF US HAVE DONE THINGS WE LOOK BACK ON IN HIGH SCHOOL AND REGRET OR CRINGE A BIT. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. I HAVE NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ANYONE. I HAVE ALWAYS TREATED WOMEN WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE KNOWN ME BEST FOR MY WHOLE LIFE. THE WOMEN WHO HAVE KNOWN ME SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. THE 65 WHO OVERNIGHT SIGNED A LETTER FROM HIGH SCHOOL SAYING I ALWAYS TREATED THEM WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. STEVE: "THE WASHINGTON POST" SAYS THAT THE PRESIDENT CALLED MR. KAVANAUGH YESTERDAY TO WISH HIM GOOD LUCK ON THAT. "THE WASHINGTON POST" ALSO SAYS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH THE PACE AT WHICH THIS HAS BEEN PROGRESSING IN THE SENATE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND HE SAYS THAT CHUCK GRASSLEY AND MITCH MCCONNELL, ACCORD ING TO "THE WASHINGTON POST HAVE BEEN TOO ACCOMMODATING. SAID THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN TOO EASILY MANIPULATED BY THE DEMOCRATS, AND HE IS SICK OF FORD'S ATTORNEYS GETTING THEIR WAY AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ACCUSATIONS ARE CREDIBLE. YOU KNOW I LIKE TO NOT USE "THE WASHINGTON POST" AS MY SOURCE. BUT, LOOK, THE PRESIDENT WANTS THIS PROCESS TO COME TO A VOTE. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE INSTANCES WHERE SOMEONE IS NOMINATED. THEY GO BEFORE. THEY HAVE A HEARING AND THEN THE SENATORS VOTE ON IT THAT'S WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT EXPECTS TO HAPPEN. HE HAS NOMINATED SOMEBODY. SENATORS HAD AMPLE TIME TO QUESTION HIM. HE HAS BEEN WILLING TO COME BACK AND ANSWER THESE NEW ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD. AND HE WANTS A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO THAT THE SENATE CAN MAKE A DECISION. I DO THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO CONTINUE TO DRAG THE PROCESS OUT AND CONTINUE TO PUT GOOD PEOPLE THROUGH THE RINGER FOR THE SAKE OF POLITICAL GAMES THAT THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO PLAY. BRIAN: I KNOW "THE WASHINGTON POST" AND WE GET THE SOME OF THE PRESS BRIEFINGS TELEVISED AT FOX SO I'M ABLE TO WATCH THEM. I KNOW THERE IS SOME TENSION IN THE "THE WASHINGTON POST" AND THE "NEW YORK TIMES." "THE WASHINGTON POST" HAD THIS STORY THAT SAID THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS CONSIDERING WEARING A WIRE TO TAPE THE PRESIDENT IN ORDER TO GET PROOF THAT HE COULD ENACT THE 25TH AMENDMENT. ESSENTIALLY TOSSING THE PRESIDENT OUT OF OFFICE. DOES HE BELIEVE THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL'S SEMI DENIALS AND WHAT WILL THAT DO FOR THURSDAY'S MEETING? I THINK THAT'S A PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WILL TAKE PLACE ON THURSDAY I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD OF A CONVERSATION THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET. THE PRESIDENT AND ROD ROSENSTEIN HAD A BEGINNING OF THAT CONVERSATION BY PHONE YESTERDAY. BOTH AGREED IT WAS BEST TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE THAT FURTHER AND LONGER AND MORE EXTENDED CONVERSATION IN PERSON. BRIAN: WHAT WAS YESTERDAY? IT WAS CONFUSING. GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE. JOHN KELLY IS THERE. YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE ADMINISTRATION DO GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE PRETTY FREQUENTLY. THAT'S NOT LIKE GROUND BREAKING NEWS. IN FACT, ROD ROSENSTEIN WAS THERE A COUPLE TIMES LAST WEEK, TOO. IT SHOULDN'T PUT EVERYONE INTO A TAIL SPIN WHEN SOMEBODY THAT WORKS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION SHOWS UP AND COMES TO THE BUILDING IN WHICH THEY WORK FOR. BRIAN: WAS IT A BIG NONSTORY FOR YOU OR WAS THERE SOME PERIL IN HIS APPEARANCE? I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD OF THE CONVERSATION THAT HE AND THE PRESIDENT ARE GOING TO HAVE ON THURSDAY. OBVIOUSLY THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTED BY A NUMBER OF ACTIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND HE WANTS SOME ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HE HAS. SOME OF THEM HAVE TO DO WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN. SOME OF THEM HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. BUT IT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND IT SHOULD WORK TO ACTUALLY FIX AND HOLD UP LAW AND ORDER NOT UNDERMINE LAW AND ORDER AND THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT'S HAPPENING. ANNA: FOLLOWING THIS MEETING ON THURSDAY IF ROSENSTEIN DECIDES TO RESIGN OR RELIEVED OF HIS DUTIES, WHAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S NEXT MOVE. I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION. WE WILL SEE HOW THURSDAY GOES AND I WILL LET THE PRESIDENT MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. STEVE: ONE OF PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEYS JAY SEKULOW SAID YESTERDAY THAT IF ROSENSTEIN LEAVES ESSENTIALLY THE MUELLER PROBABLY SHOULD BE PUT ON PAUSE FOR A LITTLE WHILE TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE A REVIEW AND STEP BACK AND SEE WHERE WE'RE ON THE STAGE. I WOULD PROBABLY GO A STEP FURTHER. THE MUELLER PROBABLY SHOULD END. THEY SPENT A YEAR AND A HALF AND FOUND NOTHING BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING. THERE IS NOTHING. THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE READY FOR THIS TO WRAP UP. WE HAVE SEEN ABSOLUTELY NO SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT THE PRESIDENT OR ANYBODY ON HIS TEAM HAD ANY WRONGDOING? N. THE CAMPAIGN. I THINK IT'S TIME TO WRAP THIS UP AND MOVE FORWARD. BRIAN: I THINK THE WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT BRAND UP NO MATTER WHERE YOU STAND AND HOW VOTED FOR. TODAY THE PRESIDENT GIVES HIS SECOND AADDRESS TO THE UNITED NATIONS. I IMAGINE NO ROCKET MAN REFERENCES. STEVE: YOU NEVER KNOW YOU NEVER KNOW. HOW CLOSE IS ROCKET MAN TO A SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN AGAIN AND NUMBER TWO, HOW HARD WILL HE BE ON IRAN? I CERTAINLY THERE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PROGRESS IN JUST A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME WITH NORTH KOREA. YOU REFERENCED THE SPEECH LAST YEAR. THINGS WERE VERY DIFFERENT AT THIS POINT A YEAR AGO WITH NORTH KOREA. TENSION WAS HIGH. BUT, DUE TOUT LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE HAVE SEEN A COMPLETE REVERSAL OF THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THE FIRST SUMMIT WENT VERY WELL AND THE COMMUNICATIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS HAVE BEEN VERY STRONG AND VERY POSITIVE FROM NORTH THE TEE KOREA. TESTING HAVE STOPPED. REMAINS HAVE COME HOME. EVERY DAY THE PROGRESS CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHERE THAT IS AND WE EXPECT A SECOND MEETING TO TAKE PLACE SOON. BRIAN: WOULD IT BE HERE OR THE GALLOPIS ISLAND. THE CONVERSATION HASN'T HAPPENED YET. THE CONVERSATIONS TO SET THAT UP ARE ONGOING AND WE EXPECT THAT TO TAKE PLACE IN SHORT ORDER. ANNA: WILL THE PRESIDENT STICK TO AMERICA FIRST AGENDA TODAY. THE POINTS HE MADE LAST YEAR AND MADE IT EVERY DAY SINCE TAKING WAS CERTAINLY AMERICA FIRST BUT NOT AMERICA ALONE. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER. I THINK YOU HAVE SEEN THE PRESIDENT DO THAT A LOT. I THINK YESTERDAY WAS A TREMENDOUS EXAMPLE OF THE PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP ON FULL DISPLAY. HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO GET BETTER TRADE DEALS AND HE HAS DONE EXACTLY THAT MONUMENTAL MOMENT TO SEAT TWO LEADERS PUFTD PEN TO PAPER AND REALLY CHANGE THE COURSE OF TRADE AGREEMENTS AND SET THE STANDARD OF WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS GOING TO DEMAND OUT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. BRIAN: WHY DIDN'T HE MEET WITH MACRON YESTERDAY. WE DID MEET WITH MACRON YESTERDAY. STEVE: MET WITH TRUDEAU. WE MET WITH MACRON. STEVE: DIDN'T MEET WITH CANADA. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS EVER ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE SCHEDULE FOR YESTERDAY. THE PRESIDENT HAD WALL-TO-WALL MEETINGS AND WENT FROM EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING UNTIL ABOUT 9:00 LAST NIGHT. AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY DON'T SPEND SOME TIME OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW DAYS. CRAZIER THINGS HAVE CERTAINLY HAPPENED. BRIAN: CRAZY. STEVE: THE DOOCY COOKBOOK IS COMING THOUGHT A WEEK AND SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS HAS DONATED YOUR RECIPE THE FAMOUS RECIPE FOR THE BOURBON CHOCOLATE PECAN PIE. JUST TO BE CLEAR THE BOURBON COOKS OUT SO FEEL FREE TO EAT IT FOR BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND DINNER. BRIAN: HE MADE IT BUT DIDN'T BUY IT. STEVE: THAT WAS THE SUGGESTION IT WAS A FAKE PICTURE SHE ACTUALLY BOUGHT THE CRUST AND MAKES THE OTHER STUFF. ANNA: WHO MAKES THE CRUST
