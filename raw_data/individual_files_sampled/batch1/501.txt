an alert for Ebola rings out over the streets of Beni in the northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo the death toll is rising for three weeks the community has been on alert but in this conflict-ridden corner of the DRC it's hard to control the virus this disease called Ebola is already close to us so customers are not wearing helmets we were told that it can spread through the sweat and our helmets are shared by our customers so we're telling customers not to wear them in the last two weeks nearly 1300 people have been vaccinated congo's National Institute for biomedical research is also testing a new drug for Ebola patients made in the US ten patients have received it and responded well knows of all dear you know when we went to Mangena there were five or six patients and two in a severe state I said we need to treat everyone we can't only administer to the less serious cases some of them were very serious and in particular a child who had bloody stools and after this treatment he is now recovering slowly the DRC had just emerged from another Ebola outbreak some 2,000 kilometers away in bokura in the West it was declared over in July just a week before this one was discovered 33 people died it was the first time when Ebola vaccine was used in an outbreak and was credited with containing the spread this time will be more challenging cases are spread across two of the most populated provinces in the country they share borders with Uganda and Rwanda and it's an active conflict zone between rebel and government forces this epidemic in North Kivu is going to bring a lot of surprises it's not like the earlier epidemic in the West the number of cases is going up and the number of infected zones is increasing so we'll take a long time to control this epidemic this is the tenth time Ebola has struck the DRC since 1976 and he said twice as many outbreaks as any other country touching the remotest of villages and the most populated of centres vaccines are providing new hope with education filling where medicine cannot Charlotte Bella's al-jazeera
