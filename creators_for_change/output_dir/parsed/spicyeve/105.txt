making your own salad dressing is pretty
simple start with one cup of
extra-virgin olive oil add 1/3 of a cup
of apple cider vinegar throw in some
garlic some basil salt pepper sugar to
cut the acidity of the vinegar and shake
it on up
looks good to me what
get your drizzle on and I'll see you on
the internet somewhere bye cypher hall I
want a CBE the place to be about some
foodstuffs food items for my pleasure
and consumption
