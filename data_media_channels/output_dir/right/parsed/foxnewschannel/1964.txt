JILLIAN: WELCOME BACK, FOX NEWS
ALERT, OVERNIGHT IRAN FIRING
BACK AT DONALD TRUMP, BURNING
THE AMERICAN FLAG AFTER HE
DECLARED THE NUCLEAR DEAL IS
DEAD.
ROB: IRAN'S PARLIAMENT SPEAKER
CALLING THE DECISION A
DIPLOMATIC SHOW.
HERE TO WAYNE ISRAELI SPECIAL
FORCES AARON:.
3 YEARS AFTER THE DEAL WAS
SIGNED, A DEAL THAT SO MANY
DIDN'T LIKE INCLUDING CHUCK
SCHUMER, NOW WE POOL OUT AND
EVERYONE HAS AN OPINION ON THIS.
>> IT IS TYPICAL OF GUYS LIKE
CHUCK SCHUMER AND ALL OF THOSE
IN WASHINGTON WHO ARE ECHO
CHAMBER CONFORMISTS.
THE WHOLE PREMISE ON WHICH TRUMP
IS SITTING AT OFFICE IS ABILITY
TO MAKE THESE UNCONVENTIONAL
DEALS BASED ON UNCONVENTIONAL
THINKING AND WE ARE IN AN
UNCONVENTIONAL WAR.
THAT IS WHAT TERROR IS,
CONSTANTLY SHIFTING TACTICS.
IRAN IS THE COCA-COLA OR PEPSI
OF SPONSORSHIP WHEN IT COMES TO
TERRORISM.
THE PRES.'S DECISION TO PULL OUT
OF THIS DEAL, SOMETHING THAT
NEEDED TO BE DONE.
TO EVERYONE I SAY TOO BAG, HAD
TO GET DONE.
ESTATE THAT LITERALLY SPONSORS
TERROR SYSTEMATICALLY.
IT HAD TO HAPPEN.
THERE IS NOTHING GOOD ABOUT IRAN
WITH ANY TYPE OF NUCLEAR WEAPON.
24 MONTHS IN THE MAKING OF HUMAN
INTELLIGENCE GATHERING, PHYSICAL
SURVEILLANCE, THIS SHOWED THE
URANIAN'S -- THEY ARE PUTTING
TOGETHER A NUCLEAR WAR.
DONALD TRUMP'S REACTION WAS ON
POINT AND THE REST OF THE WORLD
HAS A PROBLEM WITH THIS THIS IS
ABOUT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
JILLIAN: IS COULD PLAY OUT IN
THE UPCOMING WEEKS AND MONTHS,
THE US MILITARY SANCTIONING
RELATED ACTIVITY.
IN 90 DAYS THE US MAY SANCTION
ANYTHING ELSE EXEMPTED UNDER THE
JCP AWAY LIKE PRECIOUS METAL.
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS PLAYS OUT
WITH OUR ALLIES?
>> THE EUROPEANS ARE ALL ABOUT
THE EUROPEAN LEADERSHIP AND
EUROPEAN ECONOMY CAN THE
STRUGGLE THEY HAD AND THE
PROBLEMS EUROPE HAS BEEN HAVING
FOR QUITE SOME TIME, ALL
ECONOMICALLY BASED.
THE MONEY WILL START POURING IN.
IRAN, THEY DO A LOT OF BUSINESS
WITH IRAN.
WHEN YOU CUT OFF THEIR FUNNEL,
THE GATEWAY TO THE DOLLARS THEY
WILL START CRYING COOL.
EUROPEANS WHEN IT COMES TO IRAN,
THE MONEY, THE CASH FLOW,
BOOSTING THEIR ECONOMY AND
PERSONAL INTERESTS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE UNITED STATES.
WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF
OURSELVES AS AMERICANS WAS WE
HAVE A TERROR ISSUE HERE.
WE HAVE, WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF
PROBLEMS THE PRESIDENT
UNDERSTOOD VERY EARLY ON WHEN HE
RAN.
ROB: NOT TO CUT YOU OFF BUT YOU
MAKE A GOOD POINT, NUKES OR NO
NUKES IT IS OUR MONEY, MONEY WE
ARE BUYING OIL WITH THAT IS
GOING TO FUND TERROR AND ALL
THIS NONSENSE IN THE MIDDLE
EAST.
THAT IS A BIG DEAL AND WE WANT
TO SWITCH OVER TO NORTH KOREA,
ANOTHER COUNTRY DEALING WITH THE
SAME PROBLEM, A COUNTRY WE
STRANGLED FINANCIALLY WITH
SANCTIONS AND IT IS WORKING OR
APPEARS TO BE WORKING AND I WANT
TO ASK YOU THE REASON POMPEO
JUMPED ON THIS PLANE TO GO OVER,
WHEN THE SPEECH WAS MADE ABOUT
PULLING OUT, TO REASSURE NORTH
KOREA WE CAN BE TRUSTED BECAUSE
A LOT OF THE CRITICISM IS YOU
PULL OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL HOW TO
OTHER FOREIGN NATIONS TRUST THE
UNITED STATES?
>> THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS AND
POMPEO HAS BEEN RUNNING THE TOP
BY CRAFT AGENCY IN THE WORLD FOR
QUITE SOME TIME AND UNDERSTANDS
WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH
NORTH KOREA HE IS FORMER HEAD OF
THE CIA, HE IS VERY SMART BUT
THE CIA IN BY CRAFT, DOING THE
TYPES OF NEGOTIATIONS, IT DOES
INSTILL CONFIDENCE BY HIM GOING
THERE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,
AND BY HIM GETTING ON THE PLANE
AND SITTING DOWN FACE-TO-FACE
WITH NORTH KOREA, HE WILL MAKE
THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE BY LAYING
OUT A SUSTAINED PLAN.
NORTH KOREA IS ABOUT THE MONEY
ALSO.
IF THE NORTH KOREANS, THE
STRANGLING WORKS.
WE HAVE SHOWN THAT IT WORKS.
WHEN YOU CUT OFF THE CAROTID
ARTERY AND THERE IS NO BLOOD
FLOW YOU HIT THE GROUND.
WE SAW IT WORK WITH NORTH KOREA
AND WE ARE SEEING THE TOP CIA
CHIEF SAYING OKAY, WE WILL GIVE
YOU A LITTLE BIT HERE AND IT
WILL HAPPEN OVER HERE, TIME TO
STOP YOUR NUCLEAR THING BUT WE
WILL GET YOUR ECONOMY
JUMPSTARTED.
IS PLAYING OUT PERFECTLY.
THIS IS GOOD BUSINESS ON BEHALF
