KAVANAUGH HAS JUST ENTERED INTO 
THE ROOM. 
HE OF COURSE IS PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 
THESE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS ARE 
EXPECTED TO LAST SEVERAL DAYS. 
TODAY WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND FOLLOWING 
TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS, OPENING 
PROCEEDINGS, WE WILL HEAR FROM 
LAWMAKERS ESPECIALLY DEMOCRATS 
AS THEY BEGIN THEIR GRILLING OF 
THIS JUDICIAL NOMINEE. 
>> YEAH SO THE GRILLING WON'T 
ACTUALLY STARTED TO IN TERMS OF 
QUESTIONS BUT IT'S GOING TO 
TAKE SEVERAL HOURS. 
PRETTY LONG DAY. 
SO HE IS -- RIGHT NOW, WHAT THE 
QUESTIONING WILL SORT OF FOCUS 
ON -- ARE A FEW THINGS THE 
DEMOCRATS ARE INTERESTED IN. 
HIS POINT OF VIEW ON ROE V. 
WADE AND ABORTION, HIS POINT OF 
VIEW ON EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND 
EXECUTIVE POWER AND WHETHER OR 
NOT THE EXECUTIVE SHOULD BE 
SUSCEPTIBLE TO CRIMINAL 
LAWSUITS OR CIVIL LAWSUITS 
WHILE IN OFFICE. 
I THINK THINGS ARE JUST GOING 
THE START IN MAYBE SORT OF -- 
TO START? 
MAYBE SORT OF LISTEN IN. 
>> CALLING THE ROOM INTO ORDER 
WITH THE GAVEL. 
WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID THIS IS A 
SILENT PROTEST FOR THEM. 
THEY ARE THERE. 
BUT THAT THEY ARE SILENTLY -- 
THEY'RE DOING IT UNDER DURESS 
IS THE WAY THAT THEY SEEM TO 
INDICATE. 
>> THEY ARE AND YOU KNOW IT'S 
GOOD THAT YOU POINTED THAT OUT. 
BECAUSE THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER 
IS, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT CONTROL 
CONGRESS, TOE THE DEMOCRAT -- 
THOUGH THE DEMOCRATS MAY BE 
UPSET ABOUT THIS. 
IT MAY NOT PREFER HIM. 
THERE'S NOT A LOT THEY CAN DO. 
THEY'RE HOPING TO MAYBE SURE A 
COUPLE OF REPUBLICANS -- LURE A 
COUPLE OF REPUBLICANS OVER TO 
THEIR SIDE. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
>> TO SERVE AS ASSOCIATE 
>> I'D LIKE TO BE RECOGNIZED 
FOR A QUESTION BEFORE WE 
PROCEED. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I'D LIKE TO BE 
RECOGNIZED TO ASK A QUESTION 
BEFORE WE PROCEED. 
THE QUESTION RECEIVED LAST 
NIGHT -- COMMITTEE RECEIVED 
LAST NIGHT 14,000 PAGES OF 
DOCUMENTS WE HAVE NOT HAD AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW OR READ 
OR ANALYZE. 
>> YOU ARE -- YOU ARE OUT OF 
ORDER. 
I'LL PROCEED. 
>> WE CANNOT POSSIBLY MOVE 
FORWARD MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> I EXTEND A VERY WARM WELCOME 
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH -- 
>> GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
HAVE A MEANFUL -- 
>> THEIR TWO DAUGHTERS -- 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, AAGREE WITH 
MEGA-- I AGREE WITH MY 
COLLEAGUE MRS. HARRIS. 
WE HAVE RECEIVED 14,000 
DOCUMENTS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE 
TO REVIEW SINCE LAST NIGHT -- 
>> I KNOW THIS IS AN EXCITING 
DAY FOR ALL OF YOU HERE -- 
>> MR. CLAIREMAN IF WE CANNOT 
BE RECOGNIZED I MOVE TO 
ADJOURN. 
 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN I MOVE TO 
ADJOURN. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, WE HAVE BEEN 
DENIED -- WE HAVE BEEN DENIED 
REAL ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENTS WE 
NEED TO ADVISE -- 
>> REGULAR ORDER IS CALLED FOR. 
>> WHICH TURNS THIS HEARING 
INTO A CHARADE AND A MOCKERY OF 
OUR NORMS. 
>> WELL. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN I THEREFORE 
MOVE TO ADJOURN THIS HEARING. 
>> WELL. 
>> OKAY. 
>> THIS IS A MOCKERY OF 
JUSTICE. 
THIS IS --  
 
>> MR. CHAIR MILES AN HOUR, I 
ASKED FOR -- CHAIRMAN, I ASKED 
FOR A ROLE CALL VOTE ON MY 
MOTION TO ADJOURN. 
>> OKAY. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I MOVE TO 
ADJOURN. 
I ASKED FOR A ROLE CALL VOTE. 
>> WE'RE NOT IN EXECUTIVE 
SESSION. 
WE WILL CONTINUE AS PLANNED. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN MAY I BE 
RECOGNIZED ANYWHERE I APPEAL TO 
THE CHAIR TO RECOGNIZE MYSELF 
OR ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES -- 
>> YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, ON YOUR SENSE 
OF DECENCY AND INTEGRITY. 
EVEN THE DOCUMENTS YOU HAVE 
REQUESTED MR. CHAIRMAN. 
EVEN THE ONES THAT YOU SAID, 
THE LIMITED DOCUMENTS YOU HAVE 
REQUESTED, THIS COMMITTEE HAS 
NOT RECEIVED. 
AND THE DOCUMENTS WE HAVE, YOU 
SIR HAVE -- SHOULD BE 
TRANSPARENT. 
THIS COMMITTE, SIR IS A 
VIOLATION OF EVEN THE VALUES I 
HAVE HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT TIME 
AND TIME AGAIN. 
THE IDEALS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE. 
WHAT IS THE RUSH? 
WHAT ARE RETRYING TO HIDE BY 
NOT HAVING THE -- WE TRYING TO 
HIDE BY NOT HAVING THE 
DOCUMENTS OUT FRONT? 
WHAT ARE WE HIDING BY NOT 
LETTING THE DOCUMENTS O COME 
OUT? 
SIR THIS COMMITTEE IS A 
VIOLATION OF THE VALUES THAT WE 
AS A COMMITTEE STROVE FOR. 
TRANSPARENCY. 
WE ARE RETURNING THROUGH THE 
PROCESS IN A WAY THAT'S 
UNNECESSARY AND I APPEAL FOR 
THE MOTION TO AT LEAST BE VOTED 
ON. 
AT LEAST LET'S HAVE A VOTE 
BECAUSE WHEN WE WROTE YOU A 
LETTER ON AUGUST 24th, ASKING 
TO HAVE A MEETING ON THIS 
ISSUE, YOU DENIED US EVEN THE 
RIGHT TO MEET. 
SO HERE WE ARE. 
HAVING A MEETING. 
LET'S AT LEAST DEBATE THIS 
ISSUE. 
LET'S AT LEAST CALL THIS FOR A 
VOTE. 
I APPEAL TO YOUR SENSE OF 
FAIRNESS AND DECENCY AND THE 
COMMITMENTS THAT YOU MADE TO 
TRANSPARENCY. 
THIS VIOLATES WHAT YOU HAVE 
EVEN SAID AND CALLED FOR SIR. 
YOU HAVE CALLED FOR DOCUMENTS, 
YOU YOURSELF LIMITED DOCUMENTS. 
WE THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE 
MORE. 
WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE 
DOCUMENTS THAT YOU HAVE EVEN 
CALLED READY. 
SO -- FOR. 
SO SIR BASED UPON YOUR OWN 
PRINCIPLES AND VALUES I CALL 
FOR AT LEAST TO HAVE A DEBATE 
OR A VOTE ON THESE ISSUES. 
AND NOT FOR US TO RUSH THROUGH 
THIS PROCESS. 
 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN -- I HAVE HEARD 
CALLS FOR -- 
>> I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO 
SENATOR BOOKER. 
SENATOR BOOKER, I THINK THAT I 
RESPECT VERY MUCH LOT OF THINGS 
YOU DO. 
BUT YOU SPOKE ABOUT MY DECENCY 
AND MY -- YOU SPOKE ABOUT MY 
DECENCY AND INTEGRITY. 
AND I THINK YOU -- ARE TAKING 
ADVANTAGE OF MY DECENCY AND 
INTEGRITY. 
SO. 
 
>> IT IS REGULAR ORDER FOR US 
TO RECEIVE ALL THE DOCUMENTS -- 
TO RECEIVE ALL THE DOCUMENTS 
THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS ENTITLED 
TO. 
>> OKAY. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, IT IS ALSO -- 
>> I THINK -- 
>> IT IS ALSO NOT REGULAR ORDER 
FOR THE MAJORITY -- 
>> SENATOR -- 
>> TO REQUIRE THE MINORITY TO 
PRECLEAR OUR QUESTIONS AND OUR 
DOCUMENTS AND THE VIDEOS WE 
WOULD LIKE TO USE AT THIS 
HEARING. 
THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED. 
THAT IS NOT REGULAR ORDER. 
SINCE WHEN DO WE HAVE TO SUBMIT 
THE QUESTIONS AND THE PROCESS 
THAT WE WISH TO FOLLOW TO 
QUESTION THIS NOMINEE? 
>> SENATOR -- 
>> I LIKE YOUR CLARIFICATION. 
I'D LIKE YOUR RESPONSE ON THAT. 
ON WHY YOU ARE REQUESTING THAT. 
IN ORDER TO IT? 
OUR QUESTIONS. 
>> -- SUBMIT OUR QUESTIONS. 
>> I ASKED THAT YOU STOP SO WE 
CAN CONDUCT THIS HEARING THAT 
WE HAVE PLANNED IT. 
MAYBE IT ISN'T GOING EXACTLY 
THE WAY THE MINORITY WOULD LIKE 
TO HAVE IT GO. 
BUT WE HAVE SAID FOR A LONG 
PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE WERE 
GOING TO PROCEED ON THIS VERY 
DAY. 
AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO GIVE 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR WHETHER 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE ON 
THE SUPREME COURT OR NOT. 
AND YOU HAVE HEARD MY SIDE OF 
THE AISLE CALL FOR REGULAR 
ORDER. 
AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO PROCEED 
IN REGULAR ORDER. 
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF 
OPPORTUNITIES TO RESPOND TO THE 
QUESTIONS THAT THE MINORITY HAS 
LEGITIMATELY RAISED. 
AND WE WILL -- WE WILL PROCEED 
ACCORDINGLY. 
>> WHETHER CHAIRMAN? 
-- MR. CHAIRMAN, UNDER REGULAR 
ORDER, MAY I ASK A POINT OF 
ORDER? 
WHICH IS THAT WE ARE NOW 
PRESENTED WITH A SITUATION IN 
WHICH SOMEBODY HAS DECIDED THAT 
THERE ARE 100,000 DOCUMENTS 
PROTECTED BY EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE GLOAT ASSERTION OF 
EXECUTIVE -- YET NO ASSERTION 
OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE BEFORE 
THE COMMITTEE. 
HOW ARE WE TO DETERMINE WHETHER 
IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY ASSERTED 
IF THE HEARING GOES BY WITHOUT 
THE COMMITTEE EVER CONSIDERING 
THAT QUESTION? 
WHY IS IT NOT IN REGULAR ORDER 
FOR US TO DETERMINE BEFORE THE 
HEARING AT WHICH THE DOCUMENTS 
WOULD BE NECESSARY, WHETHER OR 
NOT THE ASSERTION OF PRIVILEGE 
THAT PRERENTS US FROM GETTING 
THE DOCUMENTS IS LEGITIMATE OR 
INDEED AN ACTUAL ASSERTION OF 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE? 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S 
NOT A LEGITIMATE POINT OF ORDER 
AT THIS POINT BECAUSE AT THE 
END OF THE HEARING IT'S TOO 
LATE TO CONSIDER IT. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
IF I MIGHT ADD TO THIS. 
AN INTEGRITY ON THE DOCUMENTS 
WE'VE RECEIVED. 
THERE REALLY IS NO INTEGRITY. 
THEY HAVE ALTERATIONS AND THEY 
HAVE ATTACHMENTS ARE MISSING 
AND E-MAILS ARE CUT OFF AND 
RECIPIENTS' NAMES ARE MISSING. 
THE -- FAMILIAR OF INTEREST TO 
THIS COMMITTEE BUT IT'S CUT 
OFF. 
WE -- THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES ÃºHA 
ALL THAT WE WANT EVEN THOUGH 
YOU SAID ON YOUR WEBSITE THE 
NATIONAL ARCHIVES WOULD ACT AS 
A CHECK AGAINST ANY POLITICAL 
INTERFERENCE. 
BUT -- A CHECK AFTER THE 
HEARING IS OVER IS NO CHECK. 
I THINK WE OUGHT TO AT LEAST 
HAVE THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES 
FINISH IT AND TO HAVE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME CERTAINLY MY 40 
YEARS HERE, TO HAVE SOMEBODY 
SAY THERE'S A CLAIM OF 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT HASN'T MADE SUCH A 
CLAIM. 
JUST PUTS EVERYTHING UNDER 
DOUBT. 
WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO HIDE? 
WHY ARE WE RUSHING? 
>> I CAN ANSWER ALL THE 
QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED 
BUT I THINK IF I ANSWER THOSE 
QUESTIONS IT'S GOING TO FIT 
INTO THE EFFORT OF THE MINORITY 
TO CONTINUE TO OBSTRUCT AND I 
DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S FAIR TO 
OUR JUDGE. 
IT'S NOT FAIR TO OUR 
CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS. 
BUT LET ME RESPOND TO THOSE 
NOW. 
AND THEN MAYBE WE CAN PROCEED. 
MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE 
ARE ACCUSING THE ADMINISTRATION 
OF USING EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE TO 
HIDE DOCUMENTS FROM THE 
COMMITTEE. 
I WANT TO SAY WHY THEY'RE 
WRONG. 
UNLIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 
ASSERTION OF EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE DURING FAST AND 
FURIOUS IS ONE EXAMPLE. 
THIS ASSERTION IS NOT 
LEGITIMATE. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS A SENIOR 
LAWYER IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 
HE ADVISED THE PRESIDENT ON 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS, PROVIDED 
LEGAL ADVICE ON SEPARATION OF 
POWER ISSUES, AND HANDLED 
LITIGATION MATTERS. 
AS A -- AS A SUPREME COURT HAS 
PUT IT. 
QUOTE -- UNLESS THE PRESIDENT 
CAN GIVE HIS ADVISORS SOME 
ASSURANCE OF CONFIDENTIALITY, A 
PRESIDENT COULD NOT EXPECT TO 
RECEIVE THE FULL AND STRENGTH 
SUBMISSIONS OF FACTS AND 
OPINIONS UPON WHICH THE 
AFFECTED DISCHARGE OF HIS 
DUTIES DEPENDS. 
END OF QUOTE. 
THE ISSUES JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
WORKED ON ARE EXACTLY THE SORT 
OF ISSUES THAT REQUIRE, 
ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT, 
SOME ASSURANCE OF 
CONFIDENTIALITY. 
WE IN THE SENATE AND EVERYONE 
ELSE IN AMERICA EXPECT EXACTLY 
THE SAME SORT OF 
CONFIDENTIALITY. 
MOST SENATORS WOULD NOT AGREE 
TO TURN OVER THEIR STAFF'S 
COMMUNICATION TO ANYONE. 
FOR EXAMPLE, WE DIDN'T ASKS 
THAT JUDGE KAGAN'S RECORDS FOR 
HER SERVICE WITHIN SENATOR 
BIDEN BE TURNED OVER DURING HER 
NOMINATION AND BECAUSE OF 
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE, 
EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO KEEP 
COMMUNICATIONS FROM THEIR 
LAWYERS OUT OF GOVERNMENT 
HANDS. 
WE THEREFORE DIDN'T ASK FOR 
JUSTIN GINSBURG'S DOCUMENTS IF 
HER TIME WITH THE ACLU. 
WE DIDN'T ASK FOR JUDGE 
SOTOMAYOR'S DOCUMENTS FROM HER 
TIME IN PRIVATE PRACTICE. 
IT CAN'T BE IS THAT THE GNAT 
AND ACU -- SENATE AND ALCU ARE 
ENTITLED TO -- ACLU ARE 
ENTITLED TO MORE PROTECTIONS 
THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
I WILL SPEAK TO THE 42,000 
PAGES. 
LAST NIGHT WE RECEIVED 
ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS FOR THE 
COMMITTEE'S REVIEW. 
THESE WERE DOCUMENTS WE 
REQUESTED BEFORE THE HEARING 
AND WE RECEIVED THEM BEFORE THE 
HEARING. 
JUST AS WE REQUESTED. 
THE MAJORITY STAFF BEGAN 
REVIEWING THE DOCUMENTS AS SOON 
AS THEY ARRIVED. 
AND HAS ALREADY COMPLETED ITS 
REVIEW. 
THERE IS THUS ABSOLUTELY NO 
REASON THAT'S NO REASON TO -- 
DELAY THE HEARING. 
WE HAVE RECEIVED AND READ EVERY 
PAGE OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
EXTENSIVE PUBLIC RECORD. 
THIS INCLUDES 12 YEARS OF HIS 
JUDICIAL SERVICE ON THE MOST 
IMPORTANT FEDERAL CIRCUIT COURT 
IN THE COUNTRY. 
WHERE HE AUTHORED 307 OPINIONS 
AND JOINED HUNDREDS MORE 
AMOUNTING TO MORE THAN 10,000 
PAGES OF JUDICIAL WRITING. 
WE ALSO RECEIVED AND READ MORE 
THAN 17,000 PAGES OF HIS 
SPEECHES, ARTICLES, TEACHING 
MATERIALS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS 
THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH SUBMITTED 
WITH HIS QUESTIONNAIRE. 
THE MOST ROBUST QUESTIONNAIRE 
THIS COMMITTEE HAS EVER ISSUED. 
AND OF COURSE WE RECEIVED AND 
READ MORE THAN 483,000 PAGES OF 
DOCUMENTS FROM JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S EXTENSIVE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH SERVICE. 
THIS IS MORE PAGES THAN THE 
LAST FIVE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEES COMBINED. 
IN SHORT WE HAVE MORE MATERIALS 
THAN WE HAVE HAD ON ANY SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE IN HISTORY. 
SENATORS HAVE HAD MORE THAN 
ENOUGH TIME AND MATERIALS TO 
ADEQUATELY ASSESS JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S QUALIFICATIONS AND 
SO THAT'S WHY I PROCEED. 
I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN EXCITING 
DAY FOR ALL OF YOU IN THE 
FAMILY. 
AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE 
CLOSE TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
AND YOU ARE RIGHTLY PROUD OF 
THE JUDGE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
GET TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH LATER THIS AFTERNOON. 
AFTER THIS CONFIRMATION HEARING 
AND PROCESS IS FINISHED. 
I EXPECT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL 
BECOME THE NEXT ASSOCIATE 
JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT. 
WELCOME AGAIN JUDGE. 
BEFORE I BEGIN, I WOULD WANT TO 
GIVE YOU, JUDGE, AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO INTRODUCE YOUR FAMILY. 
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND -- 
>> PUSH THE RED BUTTON IF IT'S 
NOT ON. 
>> WE HAVE OPENING REMARKS? 
>> YES WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. 
>> YEAH. 
>> THANK YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMITTEE. 
I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY 
WITH MY FAMILY. 
MY WIFE ASHLEY, PROUD WEST 
TEXAN, GRADUATE OF AB LEAN 
COOPER HIGH SCHOOL. 
NOW THE TOWN MANAGER OF OUR 
LOCAL COMMUNITY WHERE WE LIVE. 
OUR DAUGHTERS MARGARET AND 
LIZA. 
THANK THE COMMUNITY FOR 
ARRANGING A -- COMMITTEE FOR 
ARRANGING A DAY OFF FROM SCHOOL 
TODAY. 
MY MOM AND DAD. 
MARTHA AND ED KAVANAUGH. 
MY AUNT AND UNCLE. 
NANCY AND MARK MURPHY. 
AND MY FIRST COUSINS ROSIE AND 
ELIZABETH MURPHY. 
VERY HONORED TO BE HERE, 
HONORED TO HAVE MY FAMILY HERE 
AND I'M HERE BECAUSE OF THEM. 
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOUR 
FAMILY HERE. 
I WANT TO SET OUT THE GROUND 
RULES FOR THE HEARING AND I 
WANT EVERYONE TO BE ABLE TO 
WATCH THE HEARING WITHOUT 
OBSTRUCTION. 
IF PEOPLE STAND UP AND BLOCK 
THE VIEW OF THOSE BEHIND THEM, 
OR SPEAK OUT OF TURN IT'S NOT 
FAIR OR CONSIDERED TO OTHERS SO 
-- CONSIDERATE SO OTHERS SO 
OFFICERS WILL IMMEDIATELY 
REMOVE THE INDIVIDUALS AND I 
THANK THE OFFICERS FOR DOING 
THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE TO DO. 
WE'LL HAVE TEN MINUTE ROUNDS OF 
OPENING STATEMENTS WITH EACH 
MEMBER. 
THE -- EACH MEMBER. 
THE RANKING MEMBER AND I MAY GO 
OVER A LITTLE TEN MINUTES BUT 
I'M GOING TO ASK EVERYONE ELSE 
TO LIMIT YOUR REMARKS THOSE TEN 
MINUTES. 
I HOPE EVERYONE WILL RESPECT 
THAT. 
WE PLAN ON TAKING A 15 MINUTE 
BREAK AFTER SENATOR CRUZ'S 
OPENING STATEMENT. 
AFTER ALL, THE OPENING 
STATEMENTS BY SENATORS ARE 
COMPLETE WE'LL TAKE ANOTHER 15 
MINUTE ROUND BREAK TO TURN TO 
OUR INTRODUCERS WHO WILL 
FORMALLY PRESENT THE JUDGE. 
AFTER TAT, I'LL ADMINISTER THE 
OATH TO THE JUDGE AND WE'LL 
CLOSE THAT PORTION OF TODAY'S 
HEARING WITH HIS TESTIMONY. 
TOMORROW MORNING. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
WHEN WILL WE REVIEW SENATOR 
BLUMENTHAL'S MOTION TO ADJOURN? 
>> I THINK WE'RE ENTITLED TO A 
VOTE ON IT. 
THE RESPONSE IS THAT MR. 
CHAIRMAN YOU HAVE GIVEN WITH 
ALL DUE RESPECT, REALLY FLY IN 
THE FACE OF THE NORMS OF THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
OUR TRADITIONS AND OUR RULES. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, AAGREE WITH MY 
COLLEAGUE. 
IT'S STRIKING GIVING YOUR LONG 
HISTORY OF ENCOURAGING THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO TREAT 
MINORITY REQUESTS EQUAL WITH 
MAJORITY REQUESTS THAT YOU 
DISCOURAGE THE NATIONAL 
ARCHIVES FROM RESPONDING TO 
RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN'S 
REQUESTS WHICH SHE TRIED TO 
CRAFT WITH YOU TO BE IDENTICAL 
WITH THE REQUEST FOR JUSTICE 
KAGAN. 
WE SHOULDN'T BE PROCEEDING 
UNTIL WE HAVE THE FULL 
DOCUMENTS THAT ALLOW US TO 
REVIEW THE JUDGE'S RECORDS. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, LAST FRIDAY WE 
LEARNED THAT NEAR I 1 MONEY 
2,000 PAGE -- 102,000 PAGES OF 
DOCUMENTS FROM HIS WORK IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE 
ARE BEING WITHHELD FROM THE 
COMMUNITY AND THE PUBLIC. 
BASED ON A CLAIM OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE. 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE HAS NEVER 
BEEN INVOKED TO BLOCK THE 
RELEASE OF PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS 
TO THE SENATE DURING A SUPREME 
COURT NOMINATION. 
THIS INCLUDES WHEN JUSTICE 
KAGAN WAS NOMINATED TO THE 
SUPREME COURT, AS WELL AS JUS 
THE ROBERTS. 
YESTERDAY MY -- JUSTICE 
ROBERTS. 
YESTERDAY WE SENT A LETTER TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL ASKING 
THE PRESIDENT WRAITHS CLAIM OF 
PRIVILEGE OVER THE DOCUMENTS SO 
THEY CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO 
THE COMMITTEE AND TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
WE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED A 
RESPONSE TO THAT LETTER. 
SO WE SHOULD NOT BE PROCEEDING 
UNTIL WE HAVE A RESPONSE AND 
THESE DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN 
AVAILABLE. 
IT IS 102,000 DOCUMENTS. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN -- MY MOTION TO 
ADJOURN WOULD RAISE THIS ISSUE 
OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND 
WHETHER IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY 
ASSORTED FOR REASONS THAT HAVE 
BEEN OUTLINED WELL BY MY 
COLLEAGUE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE. 
THERE'S NO VALID CLAIM HERE OF 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. 
EVEN IF THERE WERE ONE IT'S NOT 
BEEN PROPERLY ASSERTED. 
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS THE 
ADMINISTRATION AFRAID OF 
SHOWING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? 
WHAT IS IT TRYING TO HIDE? 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, USING YOUR OWN 
WORDS IN THE STATEMENT YOU JUST 
READ YOU SAID I QUOTE -- WE 
HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME 
TO RE-- ENOUGH TIME TO REVIEW 
THE DOCUMENTS. 
SIR WE JUST GOT A DOCUMENT DUMP 
LAST NIGHT OF OVER 40,000 
PAGES, I WOULD SAY NOT ONE 
SENATOR HERE HAS READ THROUGH 
THE 40,000 PAGES. 
WE ARE CONTINUING TO RUSH 
THROUGH THE PROCESS A PROCESS 
THAT DESERVING TO BE 
SCRUTINIZED. 
I SUPPORT SENATOR BLUMENTHAL'S 
MOTION TO ADJOURN AND I HOPE 
THAT WE CAN AT LEAST HAVE A 
VOTE ON THAT MOTION. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I THINK YOU'D 
BE HARD-PRESSED TO FIND A COURT 
IN THE COUNTRY THAT WOULD NOT 
GIVE A PARTY LITIGANT A 
CONTINUANCE WHEN THE PARTY ON 
THE OTHER SIDE DID A 42,000 
PAGE DOCUMENT DUMP AFTER CLOSE 
OF BUSINESS THE NIGHT BEFORE 
TRIAL. 
>> WE WAITED FOR MORE THAN A 
YEAR WITH A VACANCY ON THE 
SUPREME COURT UNDER THE 
DIRECTION OF YOUR LEADER IN THE 
UNITED STATES SENATE. 
AND THE REPUBLIC SURVIVED. 
I THINK THE TREATMENT WAS 
SHABBY OF MERRICK GARLAND AND 
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NOMINEE. 
THE FACT WE CANNOT TAKE A FEW 
DAYS OR WEEKS HAVE A COMPLETE 
ARE YOU OF JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S -- REVIEW OF JUDGE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S REVIEW IS NOT 
FAIR TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
UNDER ARTICLE 2 SECTION 2 OF 
THE CONSTITUTION TO ADVISE AND 
CONSENT ON SUPREME COURT  
NOMINEES. 
>> SENATOR KORNYN? 
YOU WANT TO SPEAK. 
>> I WOULD JUST SAY THAT 
SENATOR WHITEHOUSE SUGGESTED 
THAT WE HANDLE THIS HEARING 
LIKE A COURT OF LAW. 
BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF 
THIS WERE A COURT OF LAW, THAT 
VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE MEMBER 
ON THE DAIS, ON THAT SIDE WOULD 
BE HELD IN CONTEMPT OF COURT. 
BECAUSE THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE A CIVIL ONE. 
WHERE PEOPLE GET TO ASK 
QUESTIONS AND WE CAN GET 
ANSWERS. 
AND THAT'S THE BASE BASIS UPON 
-- BASIS UPON WHICH WE ARE TO 
EXERCISE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF ADVICE AND 
CONSENT. 
JUST SUGGEST WE GET ON WITH THE 
HEARING. 
>> IF MY COLLEAGUES -- 
>> I COULD JUST RESPOND? 
IF WE CAN JUST RESPOND TO THAT. 
>> YOU CAN RESPOND BUT JUST A 
MINUTE. 
>> IF PEOPLE WONDER WHY THE 
CHAIR IS SO PATIENT DURING THIS 
WHOLE PROCESS, I HAVE FOUND 
THAT IT TAKES LONGER TO ARGUE 
WHY YOU SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING 
THAN LET PEOPLE ARGUE. 
WHY THEY WANT IT. 
THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE 
SAID THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING. 
WE'RE GOING TO BE IN SESSION 
TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, 
FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY, UNTIL 
WE GET DONE THIS WEEK. 
SO HOWEVER LONG PEOPLE WANT TO 
TAKE, WE'RE GOING TO NOT 
NECESSARILY ACCOMMODATE ALL 
OBSTRUCTION, BUT IF PEOPLE GOT 
SOMETHING TO SAY, THIS CHAIRMAN 
IS GOING TO LET THEM SAY IT. 
BUT IT GETS PRETTY BORING TO 
HEAR THE SAME THING ALL THE 
TIME. 
SENATOR BOOKER, MAKE IT QUICK 
PLEASE. 
>> I REALLY APPRECIATE THE 
DEFERENCE MR. CHAIRMAN. 
THE QUESTION WAS WHY WOULD WE 
WANT TO DELAY THIS? 
AND THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO 
DELAY. 
THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO BE FULLY 
EQUIPPED TO DO OUR 
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY WHICH 
EVERYBODY, REPUBLICANS AND 
DEMOCRATS ON THIS COMMITTEE, 
TAKE SERIOUSLY. 
IT IS VERY HARD TO PERFORM OUR 
ROLE OF ADVISE AND CONSENT WHEN 
WE DO NOT HAVE A THOROUGH 
VETTING OF THE BACKGROUND OF 
THE CANDIDATE. 
IN AREAS WHICH -- THE CANDIDATE 
HIMSELF HAS REFER TODAY AS THE 
MOST -- REFERRED TO AS THE MOST 
FORMATIVE PART OF HIS LEGAL 
CAREER, WHERE HE HIMSELF TALKED 
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THIS PERIOD 
OF HIS LIFE IS. 
WE'RE DENIED THE FULL VETTING 
AND SIR, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING 
THAT DEMOCRATS ARE ASKING FOR. 
I REMIND YOU, THAT YOU YOURSELF 
ASKED FOR A LIMITED SET OF 
DOCUMENTS FOR WHEN HE WAS IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL'S 
OFFICE. 
YOU YOURSELF SET THAT STANDARD 
AND EVEN THOUGH IN THAT LIMITED 
STANDARD, SIR, WE HAVE NOT 
RECEIVED THE DOCUMENTS. 
AND THEN EVEN THE DOCUMENTS, 
WE'VE RECEIVED 7% OF THEM. 
ALMOST HALF OF THOSE HAVE BEEN 
LABELED COMMITTEE COMFORTABLE 
THAT CANNOT -- CONFIDENTIAL 
THAT NOT K NOT BE CAN BE CANNOT 
-- CANNOT BE PUT FORWARD BEFORE 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
SIR JUST ON THE BASIC IDEALS OF 
FAIRNESS, THE TRADITIONS OF 
THIS BODY, WE SHOULD HAVE A 
FORROW UNDERSTANDING -- 
THOROUGH UNDERSTAND OF COURSE 
THE NOMINEE THAT'S PUT -- 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NOMINEE 
THAT'S PUT BEFORE US. 
IT'S UNDERMINING OF THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE TO WHICH WE 
HAVE ALL SWORN AN OATH TO 
UPHOLD. TO RESPOND TO 
SENATOR BOOKER AND FEINSTEIN. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN I ASK TO 
RESPOND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM 
TEXAS. 
>> SENATOR BOOKER, USING A 
STANDARD SET BY TWO MEMBERS OF 
YOUR POLITICAL PARTY IN THE 
CAUCUS, AND I'M GOING TO PHRASE 
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE 
CONTACT QUOTES IN FRONT OF ME. 
. RECENTLY SENATOR SCHUMER SAID 
IN FRONT OF THE FLOOR, THE BEST 
JUDGE OF WHETHER OR NOT 
SOMEBODY SHOULD BE ON THE 
CIRCUIT COURT IS DECISIONS THAT 
THEY'VE MADE AT LOWER COURTS. 
SENATOR LEAHY SAID SOMETHING 
SIMILAR TO THAT WHEN SENATOR 
SOTOMAYOR WAS BEFORE US THAT WE 
KNOW HOW MANY -- WE KNOW WHAT 
YOU HAVE DONE IN A LOWER COURT 
THAT IS THE BEST BASIS FOR 
KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT YOU 
OUGHT TO BE ON THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
SO WE HAVE 307 CASES THAT THIS 
NOMINEE HAS WRITTEN DECISIONS 
ON AS A BASIS FOR THAT. 
AND WE'VE GOT 488,000 OTHER 
PAGES AND MAYBE SENATORS 
HAVEN'T READ THEM, BUT THEIR 
STAFF IS FULLY INFORMED BECAUSE 
LAST NIGHT BEFORE 11:00 ON THE 
42,000 PAGES THAT HAVE COME TO 
OUR ATTENTION, THE STAFF ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE HAS GONE 
THROUGH THEM. 
>> BUT SIR, WHY DID YOU ASK FOR 
THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL 
DOCUMENTS? 
WHY WOULD YOU ASK FOR THEM? 
>> SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 
>> FOR A RECORD THAT IS A 
RECORD OF 7,000 PAGES PER HOUR. 
THAT IS SUPER HUMAN. 
>> THEY'RE AMAZING. 
THEY'RE AMAZING. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, IF I MAY. 
I'VE BEEN THROUGH NINE SUPREME 
COURT HEARINGS. 
>> IS THIS YOUR OPENING 
STATEMENT? 
>> IT'S PART OF IT. 
>> WHY DON'T YOU PEAK YOUR 
OPENING STATEMENT HEARING. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN I WOULD LIKE TO 
RESPOND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM 
TEXAS BECAUSE HE IS DIRECTLY 
CHALLENGED. 
>> I SAID YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I ASK IN THE 
PROCESS OF REGULAR ORDER AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO WHAT 
I BELIEVE WAS A PERSONAL 
ATTACK. 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU 
GIVE SENATOR FEINSTEIN THE 
COURTESY OF LISTENING TO HER 
OPENING STATEMENT. 
>> WELL, I WAS JUST GOING TO 
SAY SOME THINGS AND YOU HEARD 
THAT THIS IS MY NINTH HEARING 
AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO LOOK 
AT THIS. 
THESE ARE VERY UNIQUE 
CIRCUMSTANCES. 
NOT ONLY IS THE COUNTRY DEEPLY 
DIVIDED POLITICALLY, WE ALSO 
FIND OURSELF WITH A PRESIDENT 
WHO FACES HIS OWN SERIOUS 
PROBLEMS. 
OVER A DOZEN CABINET MEMBERS 
AND SENIOR AIDS TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAVE RESIGNED, BEEN 
FIRED, OR FAILED THEIR 
CONFIRMATIONS UNDER CLOUDS OF 
CORRUPTION, SCANDAL, AND 
SUSPICION. 
THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL 
LAWYER, CACKLE CAMPAIGN 
MANAGER, DEPUTY CAMPAIGN 
MANAGER, AND SEVERAL CAMPAIGN 
SUPERVISORS HAVE BEEN ENTANGLED 
BY GUILTY PLEAS AND 
CONVICTIONS. 
SO IT'S THIS BACKDROP THAT THIS 
NOMINEE COMES INTO WHEN WHAT 
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS, IS HE 
WITHIN THE MAINSTREAM OF 
AMERICAN LEGAL OPINION AND WILL 
HE DO THE RIGHT THING BY THE 
CONSTITUTION? 
WE ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING THE 
VETTING PROCESS THAT HAS CAST 
ASIDE TRADITION IN FAVOR OF 
SPEED. 
WHEN JUSTICE SCALIA DIED, 
REPUBLICANS REFUSED TO EVEN 
MEET, EVEN A MEETING IN THEIR 
OFFICE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 
NOMINEE AND HELD THE SEAT OPEN 
FOR ONE YEAR NOW WITH A 
REPUBLICAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR POSITION. 
THE MAJORITY RUSHED INTO THIS 
HEARING AND IS REFUSING TO EVEN 
LOOK AT NOMINEE'S FULL RECORD. 
IN FACT, 93% OF THE RECORDS 
FROM KAVANAUGH'S TENURE IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE AS COUNSEL AND 
STAFF SECRETARY HAVE NOT BEEN 
PROVIDED TO THE SENATE. 
AND 96% HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN TO 
THE PUBLIC. 
WE DO KNOW WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
THINKS OF THIS NOMINEE. 
DON MCGANN, THE WHITE HOUSE 
COUNSEL, SPOKE TO THE 
FEDERALIST SOCIETY AND MADE 
CLEAR BRETT KAVANAUGH IS 
EXACTLY THE KIND OF NOMINEE THE 
PRESIDENT WANTED. 
IN A SPEECH, MR. MCGANN 
DISCUSSED HIS TWO LISTS OF 
POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEES. 
ONE HE SAID WAS FILLED WITH 
MAINSTREAM CANDIDATES. 
THE OTHER LIST INCLUDED CABBED 
DATES THAT ARE KIND -- INCLUDED 
CANDIDATES THAT ARE TOO HOT FOR 
PRIME TIME. 
PROBABLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE 
WRITTEN A LOT. 
WE REALLY GET A SENSE OF THEIR 
VIEWS. 
THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT MAKE 
PEOPLE NERVOUS. 
THAT IS A QUOTE. 
NOW WHAT I'M SAYING, THIS IS 
THE BACKDROP INTO WHICH WE COME 
INTO THIS SITUATION. 
SO YES, THERE IS FRUSTRATION ON 
THIS SIDE. 
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE 
PRIOR NOMINEE, THE LAST ONE 
PRESIDENT OBAMA PRESENTED TO 
US. 
HE NEVER EVEN GOT A MEETING. 
HE NEVER GOT A HEARING. 
HE NEVER GOT A VOTE. 
AND NOW THE RUSH TO JUDGMENT 
AND THE INABILITY TO REALLY 
HAVE A CIVIL AND POSITIVE 
PROCESS ENDS UP BEING THE 
RESULT. 
I REALLY REGRET THIS BUT I 
THINK YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND 
THE FRUSTRATION ON THIS SIDE OF 
THE AISLE. 
EVERYONE ON THIS SIDE OF THE 
AISLE WANTS TO DO A GOOD JOB. 
THEY WANT TIME TO BE ABLE TO 
CONSIDER WHAT THE FINDINGS ARE. 
AND THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS 
OF PAGES OF E-MAILS AND OTHER 
ITEMS WHICH COULD CONSTITUTE 
FINDINGS ON A WHOLE HOST OF 
MAJOR SUBJECTS THAT THIS 
NOMINEE MAY BE FACED WITH. 
AND THEY ARE SERIOUS. 
THE TORTURE ISSUES. 
ALL OF THE ENRON ISSUES HE'S 
BEEN THROUGH. 
ALL OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT 
WE WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT. 
SO I MEAN, UNDERSTAND WHERE 
WE'RE COMING THERE. 
IT'S NOT TO CREATE A 
DISRUPTION, IT'S NOT TO MAKE 
THIS A VERY BAD PROCESS, IT IS 
TO SAY MAJORITY GIVE US A TIME 
TO DO OUR WORK SO WE CAN HAVE A 
POSITIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE 
HEARING ON A MAN THAT MAY BE 
THE DECIDING VOTE FOR MANY OF 
AMERICA'S FUTURES. 
>> I ASK FOR A SECOND. 
>> SECOND MOTION. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN I ASK FOR A 
VOTE. 
I ASK THAT WE RECONVENE AND 
HAVE A VOTE. 
>> I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN 
TO YOU, WE'RE HAVING A HEARING. 
IT'S OUT OF ORDER. 
WE'RE NOT IN EXECUTIVE SESSION. 
THAT WOULD BE THE PROPER FORM 
FOR ENTERTAINING MOTIONS. 
>> I ASK THAT RECONVENE IN 
EXECUTIVE SESSION. 
>> WE WON'T VOTE ON SENATOR 
BLUMENTHAL'S SUGGESTION. 
WE WON'T FOLLOW YOUR 
SUGGESTION. 
>> WELL IT'S A MOTION MR. 
CHAIRMAN. 
>> TO GO INTO EXECUTIVE 
SESSION. 
MOTIONS WOULD NOT BE PROPER AT 
THIS TIME. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, IT'S A PENDING 
MOTION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, IF THERE IS NO 
VOTE ON THIS MOTION WHICH HAS 
BEEN PROPERLY SECONDED AND 
WHICH COULD BE GIVEN A VOTE IN 
EXECUTIVE SESSION, THIS PROCESS 
WILL BE TAINTED AND STAINED 
FOREVER. 
I'M ASKING AS A MEMBER OF THIS 
COMMITTEE IT'S MY RIGHT TO DO 
SO THAT WE VOTE ON MY MOTION TO 
ADJOURN AND SENATOR HARRIS 
MOTION POSTPONED AND THAT WE DO 
IT IN EXECUTIVE SESSION WHICH 
CAN BE EASILY AND QUICKLY 
CONVENED RIGHT NOW. 
>> THE MOTION IS OUT OF ORDER. 
>> SIR, I MAKE A VERY CLEAR AND 
SIMPLE MOTION TO MOVE INTO 
EXECUTIVE SESSION SO THAT 
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL'S MOTION MAY 
BE CONSIDERED. 
>> THE MOTION IS OUT OF ORDER. 
>> THEY'RE NOT OUT OF ORDER. 
THEY ARE PROPERLY BEFORE THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
SIMPLY SAYING SO, WITH ALL DUE 
RESPECT, AND I HAVE GREAT 
RESPECT FOR THE CHAIRMAN. 
DOESN'T MAKE THEM SO. 
DOESN'T MAKE THEM OUT OF ORDER 
JUST BECAUSE THE CHAIRMAN RULES 
THEM OUT OF ORDER. 
SOMEWHERE A NUMBER OF EXCELLENT 
LAWYERS IN THIS ROOM AND I ASK 
THAT THIS BODY DO NOW WHAT ITS 
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO HAVE AN 
EXECUTIVE SESSION SO THAT WE 
CAN VOTE ON A MOTION TO ADJOURN 
AND THEN WE CAN DELIBERATELY 
AND THOUGHTFULLY CONSIDER THE 
DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN 
PRESENTED AND ALSO REVIEW THE 
COMMITTEE DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE 
BEEN MARKED CONFIDENTIAL 
WITHOUT ANY REASON OR RATIONAL. 
>> THE MOTION IS DENIED. 
>> SIR, HOW LONG WOULD THAT 
TAKE? 
TEN MINUTES FOR US TO HAVE A 
MOTION AND VOTE ON THIS 
PROCESS? 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE 
RUSH IS THAT WE CAN'T EVEN LET 
SENATORS VOTE ON WHAT IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT MOTION GERMANE TO OUR 
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES BEFORE 
THIS BODY. 
BEFORE WE PROCEED? 
I DON'T UNCTION. 
IT WON'T TAKE THAT MUCH TIME. 
WHAT IS THE RUSH? 
WHAT ARE WE AFRAID OF? 
TO HOLE A VOTE ON THE MOTIONS 
BEFORE US. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> SENATOR KENNEDY. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE 
PROCESS. 
I UNDERSTAND MY COLLEAGUES WANT 
AND I UNDERSTAND THEY FEEL 
STRONGLY ABOUT THIS. 
BUT WHAT ARE GOING TO BE THE 
GROUND RULES TODAY? 
ARE WE GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO 
INTERRUPT EACH OTHER? 
INTERRUPT A  WITNESS? 
SHOULD WE SEEK RECOGNITION FROM 
THE CHAIR. 
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE GROUND 
RULES. 
>> PROPER RESPECT AND DECORUM, 
PLUS HOW WE NORMALLY HAVE DONE 
BUSINESS IN A HEARING LIKE 
THIS. 
WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING ALL OF 
THESE MOTIONS. 
YOU'RE NEW TO THE SENATE SO 
THIS IS SOMETHIN I'VE NEVER 
GONE THROUGH BEFORE IN 15 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS THAT 
I HAVE BEEN SINCE I'VE BEEN ON 
HERE. 
AND EVERY MEMBER I WAS 
INTERRUPTED BEFORE I GOT A 
CHANCE TO SAY WHAT THE AGENDA 
FOR TODAY. 
BUT EVERY MEMBER IS GOING TO 
GET A TEN MINUTES TO MAKE THEIR 
REMARKS AND THEN WE WILL GO TO 
THE INTRODUCERS OF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
THERE WILL BE THREE OF THOSE. 
THEY WILL TAKE THE USUAL TIME 
OF INTRODUCERS AND THEN WE WILL 
HAVE THE SWEARING IN OF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AND THEN WE'LL HAVE 
HIS OPENING REMARKS AND THEN 
WE'LL ADJOURN FOR TODAY. 
WE'LL RECONVENE AT 9:30 ON 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. 
EACH MEMBER WILL HAVE 30 
MINUTES TO ASK QUESTIONS OR 
MAYBE ALL OF THESE POINTS 
THEY'RE MAKING RIGHT NOW FOR 
THE FIRST ROUND. 
AND THEN THERE WILL BE A SECOND 
ROUND OF 20 MINUTES EACH. 
SO EVERY MEMBER IS GOING TO GET 
50 MINUTES TO ASK ALL THE 
QUESTIONS OR MAKE ALL THE 
STATEMENTS THAT THEY WANT TO 
MAKE IN REGARD TO ANYTHING 
ABOUT THIS CANDIDATE OR 
ANYTHING ABOUT HOW THIS MEETING 
IS BEING CONDUCTED. 
AND THEN WE WILL GO LATE INTO 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT OR THURSDAY 
NIGHT UNTIL WE GET DONE WITH 
THE QUESTIONING OF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AND THEN ON THURSDAY 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THREE 
PANELS OF SIX EACH EVENLY 
DIVIDED FOR PEOPLE THAT THINK 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE ON 
THE SUPREME COURT AND PEOPLE 
THAT THINK HE SHOULD NOT BE ON 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
AND WE HOPEFULLY GET THAT DONE 
FRIDAY. 
BUT IF WE HAVE TO GO SATURDAY 
AND SUNDAY, WE'LL GO SATURDAY 
AND SUNDAY UNTIL WE GET IT ALL 
DONE. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, HOW CAN WE 
POSSIBLY -- 
>> DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR 
QUESTION, SENATOR KENNEDY? 
>> WELL, IF I WANT -- YES, MR. 
CHAIRMAN. 
I APPRECIATE IT. 
IF I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING, DO 
I NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THE 
CHAIR? 
>> THAT WOULD BE THE WAY THAT 
IT'S HANDLED. 
I'VE TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU, I 
WANT TO BE PATIENT BECAUSE 
SOMETIMES IF YOU ARE NOT 
PATIENT AND YOU ARGUE WHY 
SOMETHING SHOULDN'T BE DONE, IT 
TAKES LONGER THAN IT DOES JUST 
TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE. 
BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD 
HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE SAME 
THING THREE OR FOUR TIMES. 
>> WELL PATIENCE IS GOOD, MR. 
CHAIRMAN. 
BUT I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND 
THE RULES. 
>> YEAH YOU SHOULD BE 
RECOGNIZED. 
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE 
BEEN PATIENT AND LISTENED TO 
PEOPLE NOT BE RECOGNIZED AND 
SPEAK ANY WAY BECAUSE I WOULD 
LIKE TO HAVE THIS BE A PEACEFUL 
SESSION. 
>> BEFORE I TRY YOUR PATIENCE, 
I'M DONE. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN I HAVE A 
QUESTION ABOUT GROUND RULES. 
>> GO AHEAD. 
>> THE QUESTION IS, BEFORE WE 
CAN PROCEED, I WOULD LIKE TO 
KNOW WHETHER THE MAJORITY IS 
STILL REQUIRING OF ALL OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THIS 
COMMITTEE TO PRECLEAR OF THE 
QUESTIONS, DOCUMENTS, AND 
VIDEOS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO 
USE AT THIS HEARING. 
>> IF THE -- I WAS HOPING THAT 
ON THE SUBJECT THAT YOU JUST 
BROUGHT UP THAT WE WOULD HAVE 
SOME CLARIFICATION OF WHAT YOU 
WANT TO APPROACH THAT. 
AND I'M NOT PREPARED TO ANSWER 
THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I DON'T 
KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER HAS BEEN 
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO GIVE ME 
WHAT YOU THINK THE ANSWER HAS 
BEEN OF DISCUSSION BETWEEN OUR 
STAFF ON THAT SUBJECT. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I DON'T THINK 
IT'S EVER BEEN A CASE IN A 
HEARING LIKE THIS THAT THE 
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE 
TO PRECLEAR WHAT WE PROPOSE TO 
QUERY THE NOMINEE ABOUT. 
I THINK THAT IS TOTALLY 
UNPRECEDENTED. 
>> AND MR. CHAIRMAN, IF WE 
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE. 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO 
SENATOR HORANO. 
THE REASON WE'RE HAVING THAT 
DISCUSSION IS, AT LEAST IN MY 
TIME ON THIS COMMITTEE AND FOR 
15 NOMINATIONS, WE'VE NEVER HAD 
A REQUEST FOR A VIDEO. 
SO I WOULD -- IT SEEMS TO ME TO 
BE COURTEOUS TO ALL THE MEMBERS 
OF THE COMMITTEE, IT WOULD BE 
NICE TO KNOW THE PURPOSE AND 
WHAT IT MIGHT CONTAIN. 
ANY QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO ASKS, 
YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS. 
IT WASN'T ABOUT WHAT QUESTIONS 
YOU WERE GOING TO ASK. 
IT'S ABOUT THE PRESENTATION OF 
SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN A 
PART OF THE SUPREME COURT 
HEARING IN THE PAST. 
I THINK I WILL BOMB BACK AND 
FORTH. 
SENATOR TILLIS. 
>> MR. L CHAIRMAN, I'M 
CONFUSED. 
I HEARD THIS WAS A REACTION TO 
THE DOCUMENTS RELEASED LAST 
NIGHT. 
I'M REVIEWING A TWEET FROM NBC 
THAT SAID DEMOCRATS PLOTTED 
COORDINATED PROTEST STRATEGY 
OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND ALL 
AGREE TODDIES RESPECT -- AGREED 
TO DISRUPT AND PROTEST THE 
HEARING. 
AND CHUCK SCHUMER LED A PHONE 
CALL. 
SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR, NONE OF 
THE MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE 
PARTICIPATED IN THAT PHONE CALL 
OR STRATEGY BEFORE THE 
DOCUMENTS WERE RELEASED 
YESTERDAY? 
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THIS 
ALLEGATION IS FALSE? 
>> THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. 
>> SENATOR DURBIN. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE WAS A 
PHONE CONFERENCE YESTERDAY. 
AND I CAN TELL YOU AT THE TIME 
OF THE PHONE CONFERENCE, MANY 
ISSUES WERE RAISED. 
ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THE FACT 
THAT OVER 100,000 DOCUMENTS 
RELATED TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAVE 
BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL. 
I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THIS 
COMMITTEE FOR A NUMBER OF 
YEARS. 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 
DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN REALLY 
LIMITED TO EXTRAORDINARY 
CIRCUMSTANCES. 
AS AN EXAMPLE, IF SOMEONE IS 
ACCUSED OF TAKING DRUGS DURING 
THE COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATION 
AND I'M NOT MAKING ANY 
SUGGESTION THAT IS EVEN THE 
CASE OR CLOSE TO IT HERE. 
IT WAS DONE IN A CONFIDENTIAL 
SETTING. 
IN FAIRNESS TO THE NOMINEE. 
AND THE SAME THING ON DUI'S AND 
ALIKE. 
WE USED AN EXTREMELY RARE 
CIRCUMSTANCES WE WOULD MEET 
AFTER THE HEARING AND RELATED 
TO A HANDFUL OF PAGES OR 
DOCUMENT REFERENCES. 
INSTEAD WHAT WE FOUND NOW IS 
THAT WE WERE SEEING HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS 
CHARACTERIZED AS COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL UNILATERALLY. 
IT'S NOT DONE ON A BIPARTISAN 
BASIS. 
IT'S DONE AS A CHAIRMAN. 
THE WHOLE QUESTION OF WHETHER 
THIS COMMITTEE IS GOING TO HEAR 
A NOMINEE FOR A LIFETIME 
APPOINTMENT TO THE HIGHERS 
COURT IN THE LAND WITHOUT 
ACCESS TO BASIC INFORMATION 
ABOUT HIS PUBLIC RECORD. 
HIS PUBLIC RECORD AS SECRETARY 
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
STAFF SECRETARY. 
35 MONTHS OF PUBLIC SERVICE 
WE'VE BEEN TOLD CANNOT BE 
CONSIDERED. 
THE DOCUMENTS OF THAT SERVICE 
CAN NOT BE CONSIDERED. 
SO I WOULD SAY TO THE 
GENTLEMAN, THE SENATOR FROM 
NORTH CAROLINA, THERE WAS A 
CONVERSATION YESTERDAY ABOUT 
THESE DOCUMENTS. 
I HAD NO IDEA THAT AT 11:00 
LAST NIGHT 42,000 MORE 
DOCUMENTS WOULD BE PUT ON TOP 
OF US AND WE'D BE ASKED TO TAKE 
THEM UP TODAY. 
SO IT ADDED INSULT TO INJURY. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I ASK TO BE 
RECOGNIZE UNDER RULE FOUR. 
THE CHAIRMAN SHALL ENTERTAIN A 
NOT DEBATABLE MOTION TO BRING A 
MATTER BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TO 
A VOTE IF THERE IS OBJECTION TO 
BRING THE MATTER TO A VOTE, A 
ROLL CALL OF THE COMMITTEE 
SHALL BE TAKEN AND DEBATE SHALL 
BE TERMINATED IF THE MOTION TO 
BRING THE MATTER TO A VOTE 
WITHOUT FURTHER DEBATE PASSES 
WITH 11 VOTES IN THE 
AFFIRMATIVE ONE OF WHICH MUST 
BE CAST BY THE MINORITY. 
I ASK FOR A VOTE ON MY MOTION 
TO ADJOURN UNDER RULE FOUR, MR. 
CHAIRMAN. 
THESE ARE RULES THAT WE ARE 
OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW. 
THE CHAIRMAN HAS NO RIGHT, WITH 
ALL DUE RESPECT, TO SIMPLY OVER 
RIDE THEM BY FIAT. 
>> WE ARE OBLIGATED, WE ARE 
OBLIGATED BY THAT RULE IN 
EXECUTIVE SESSION. 
WE'RE NOT IN EXECUTIVE SESSION. 
I WOULD RESPOND TO THE ISSUES 
BROUGHT UP BY SENATOR DURBIN 
ABOUT CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS. 
I WAS CRITICIZED FOR MY 
DECISION TO RECEIVE SOME 
DOCUMENTS ON COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL. 
BUT I'M DOING EXACTLY WHAT I 
DID DURING JUDGE GORSUCH 
CONFIRMATION AND WHAT CHAIRMAN 
LEAHY DID DURING JUDGE KASICHS. 
THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF 
TREATING REGULAR COMMITTEE 
PRACTICES OF SOMEHOW OUT OF THE 
ORDINARY. 
PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS THAT WE 
RECEIVE OFTEN CONTAIN HIGHLY 
SENSITIVE ADVICE TO THE 
PRESIDENT, AS WELL AS, PERSONAL 
PRIVACY INFORMATION. 
LIKE FULL NAMES, DATE OF BIRTH 
AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND 
BANK ACCOUNT NUMBERS. 
LIKE MY PREDECESSOR, AGREED TO 
RECEIVE SOME PRESIDENTIAL 
RECORDS AS COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL SO BOTH DEMOCRATS 
AND REPUBLICNS COULD BEGIN 
REVIEWING JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
MATERIALS MUCH EARLIER. 
I DON'T KNOW WHY MY DEMOCRAT 
COLLEAGUES OBJECT TO RECEIVING 
DOCUMENTS FASTER. 
BUT NOT ALL OF THESE 
PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS REMAIN 
CONFIDENTIAL. 
IN FACT, NEARLY TWO-THIRDS 
ALEADY BECAME PUBLIC. 
THESE RECORDS ARE POSTED ON THE 
COMMITTEE'S PUBLIC WEBSITE AND 
AVAILABLE TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
AS A RESULT, WE PROVIDED 
UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC ACCESS TO 
A RECORD NUMBER OF PRESIDENTIAL 
RECORDS AND DID IT IN RECORD 
TIME. 
THE MOST SENSITIVE PRESIDENTIAL 
RECORDS REMAINS COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL UNDER FEDERAL LAW. 
JUST AS THEY WERE DURING THE 
NOMINATIONS OF KAY BEGIN OR 
GORSUCH. 
BUT WE HAVE EXPANDED ACCESS TO 
THESE DOCUMENTS ALSO INSTEAD OF 
JUST PROVIDING ACCESS TO 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE PROVIDED 
ACCESS TO ALL 100 SENATORS. 
INSTEAD OF JUST PROVIDING 
ACCESS TO A VERY FEW COMMITTEE 
AIDS, WE PROVIDED ACCESS TO ALL 
COMMITTEE AIDS. 
AND INSTEAD OF JUST PROVIDING 
ACCESS TO PHYSICAL BINDERS OF 
PAPER, WE HAVE PROVIDED 24/7 
DIGITAL AND SEARCHABLE ACCESS. 
THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS TO 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 
MATERIAL. 
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT 
MY STAFF SET UP WORKSTATIONS 
AND HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE 24/7 TO 
HELP SENATORS THAT ARE NOT ON 
COMMITTEE ACCESS CONFIDENTIAL 
MATERIALS, BUT NOT ONE SENATOR 
SHOWED UP. 
I GUESS SENATORS COMPLAINING 
ABOUT LACK OF ACCESS TO 
CONTINUE CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS 
WON'T BE INTERESTED IN SEEING 
THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. 
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE MORE 
DOCUMENTS ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE 
THAN IN ANY PRIOR SUPREME COURT 
NOMINATION. 
AND THEN TO THE ISSUE ABOUT 
HIDING COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 
DOCUMENTS. 
SOME COLLEAGUES AND YOU'VE 
HEARD IT THIS MORNING ACCUSED 
OF HIDING DOCUMENTS. 
THEY ARE SUGGESTING THAT SOME 
OF THE COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 
DOCUMENTS CONTAIN INFORMATION 
THAT WOULD BE OF GREAT INTEREST 
TO THE PUBLIC. 
WELL, JUST AS I DID LAST YEAR 
DURING JUSTICE GORSUCH'S 
CONFIRMATION, I PUT A PROCESS 
IN PLACE THAT WOULD ALLOW MY 
COLLEAGUES TO OBTAIN THE PUBLIC 
RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL 
DOCUMENTS FOR USE DURING THE 
HEARING. 
ALL I ASK WAS MY COLLEAGUES TO 
IDENTIFY THE DOCUMENTS INTENDED 
TO USE AND I WOULD WORK TO GET 
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND 
FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH TO AGREE 
TO WAVE RESTRICTIONS ON THE 
DOCUMENTS. 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN SECURED THE 
PUBLIC RELEASE OF 19 DOCUMENTS 
LAST YEAR UNDER THIS PROCESS. 
AND SECURED THE RELEASE OF FOUR 
DOCUMENTS THIS YEAR. 
IF MY COLLEAGUES TRULY BELIEVE 
THAT OTHER COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS 
SHOULDN'T BE MADE PUBLIC, THEY 
NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THEM AND 
REQUEST THE ONES THAT THEY 
WANTED. 
INSTEAD OF SCARING THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE BY SUGGESTING THAT WE'RE 
HIDING SOME INCRIMINATING 
DOCUMENTS, THEY SHOULD HAVE 
MADE A REQUEST THAT I WORK TO 
GET THE COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 
DESIGNATION REMOVED. 
THIS YEAR I RECEIVED NO SUCH 
REQUEST EXPECT FROM SENATOR 
CLOBERCHAR WHICH WAS HONORED IN 
THE DOCUMENTS THAT SHE WANTED 
TO USE DURING THIS HEARING. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU STATED 
WHAT I DID AND YOU STATED 
INACCURATELY. 
I THINK I HAVE THE RIGHT. 
>> I SAID I WAS PARAPHRASING 
IT. 
YOU CAN CORRECT ME WHATEVER YOU 
WANT. 
>> IT WAS ONE HECK OF A 
PARAPHRASES. 
WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT DOING THE 
SAME THING WITH SENATOR KAGAN. 
I WAS CHAIRMAN WHEN KAGAN WAS 
HERE. 
WE HAD 19% OF HER RECORDS FROM 
THE WHITE HOUSE WERE MADE 
PUBLIC 12 DAYS, 12 DAYS BEFORE 
THE HEARING. 
WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH WE HAVE 7% 
AND ONLY 4% ARE PUBLIC. 
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT NUMBER OF 
PAGES, THE FACT IS 99% FOR 
KAGAN 12 DAYS BEFORE THE 
HEARING. 
IT WAS ALL AVAILABLE. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH 7% AND ONLY 4% 
MADE PUBLIC. 
SO IF WE'RE GOING TO ARGUE WHAT 
WAS PRECEDENT, I WOULD POINT 
OUT THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE 
SENATE FOR 19 SUPREME COURT 
NOMINATIONS. 
WHAT IS BEING DONE HERE IS 
UNPRECEDENT. 
AND I KEEP COMING BACK TO THE 
SAME QUESTION I ASKED. 
WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO HIDE? 
WHAT ARE WE HIDING? 
WHAT IS BEING HIDDEN? 
WHY NOT HAVE IT OPEN LIKE ALL 
OTHERS? 
ONLY OTHER TIME WE HEARD A 
PRESIDENT INVOKE EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE WAS PRESIDENT REAGAN. 
WINTERMAN SAID DON'T DO THAT. 
HE SAID OKAY. 
YOU'RE RIGHT. 
AND HE WITHDREW HIS REQUEST OF 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND 
RELEASED THE DOCUMENTS. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> I'M JUST SORRY TO SEE THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
DESCEND THIS WAY. 
I FELT PRIVILEGED TO SERVE HERE 
UNDER REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC 
LEADERSHIP FOR OVER 40 YEARS. 
THIS IS NOT THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I SAW WHEN 
I CAME TO THE U.S. SENATE. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, MY NAME WAS 
INVOKED BY YOU. 
CAN I PLEASE RESPOND? 
>> AFTER I GET DONE. 
I WANT TO GIVE THE EXACT QUOTE 
I WAS PARAPHRASING. 
CHAIRMAN LEAHY SAID QUOTE, WE 
HAVE JUDGE SOTOMAYOR'S RECORD 
FROM THE FEDERAL BENCH. 
THAT IS A PUBLIC RECORD WE HAD 
EVEN BEFORE SHE WAS DESIGNATED 
BY THE PRESIDENT. 
JUDGE SOTOMAYO JUDICIAL 
RESTRAINT AND MODESTY IS THE 
BEST INDICATION OF HER JUDICIAL 
PHILOSOPHY. 
WE DO NOT HAVE TO IMAGINE WHAT 
KIND OF A JUDGE SHE WILL BE 
BECAUSE WE SEE WHAT KIND OF A 
JUDGE SHE HAS BEEN. 
SO THAT IS WHY MY ANSWER TO THE 
GOLD STANDARD OF WHETHER 
SENATOR KAVANAUGH OUGHT TO BE 
ON THE SUPREME COURT BASED UPON 
WHAT DEMOCRATS THEMSELVES HAVE 
SAID IS THE BEST JUDGE OF 
WHETHER YOU SHOULD BE ON THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
SENATOR CLOBBER CHUCK. 
>> YOU MENTIONED WHAT I SAID. 
BUT YOU NEGLECT TO MENTION,  
CAREFULLY NEGLECT TO MENTION 
THAT REPUBLICANS ASKED FOR FOUR 
MINUTES FROM HER -- BOARD 
MINUTES FROM HER WORK IN THE 
1980s. 
LONG BEFORE SHE WAS CONSIDERED 
AS A JUDGE. 
YOU ASKED FOR THAT AND WE GOT 
IT FOR YOU. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU CALLED ON 
ME. 
>> BEFORE SENATOR CLOBBER CHEER 
SPEAKS. 
WE HAVE 488,000 PAGES OF 
DOCUMENTS. 
GO AHEAD SENATOR. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. L 
CHAIRMAN. 
A FEW POINTS HERE. 
NUMBER ONE JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR 
NEVER WORKED IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
SO NONE OF THESE ISSUES OF 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGES ARE 
RELEVANT. 
NUMBER TWO MILE I APPRECIATE 
YOU GRANTING MY REQUEST MR. 
CHAIRMAN, ON THESE CAMPAIGN 
FINANCE DOCUMENTS, THIS IS ALL 
THEY WERE. 
THIS IS IT. 
THIS IS HOW MANY PAGES. 
YET, WE HAVE 148,000 DOCUMENTS 
THAT WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT 
PUBLICLY. 
AND I WILL SAY THEY ARE 
ILLUMINATING. 
IT SHOWS THE NOMINEE HAS A 
LIMITED VIEW OF CAMPAIGN 
FINANCE REFORM IN HIS OWN WORDS 
HE SAYS THAT HIS VIEWS ON THE 
FIRST AMENDMENT ARE PURE WHEN 
IT COMES TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT 
ISSUE. 
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT MORE 
IN THE FUTURE. 
BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND 
THAT IS THAT YES, I ASKED FOR 
THESE DOCUMENTS, BUFF I HAVE 
JOINED SEVERAL LETTERS LED BY 
SENATOR FEINSTEINASKING THAT 
ALL THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE 
IN THE COMMITTEE BE MADE PUBLIC 
SO THAT WE CAN ASK QUESTIONS. 
AND THEN FINALLY MY INITIAL 
POINT I'M SO FOCUSED ON THE 
102,000 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS FROM 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S WORK IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL -- IF YOU 
HAVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE TO BLOCK 
THE RELEASE DURING THE SUPREME 
COURT NOMINATION. 
AS FAR AS MY RESEARCH SHOWS, 
THIS WASN'T DONE FOR JUSTICE 
KAGAN OR REPORTERS. 
AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU 
HAVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS. 
>> IT WAS DONE BY JUSTICE 
ROBERTS. 
>> WHEN SHE WAS A SOLICITOR 
GENERAL. 
BUT DURING THE TIME THEY WORKED 
IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THAT IS MY QUESTION. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I WOULD LIKE 
TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF 
THE CHAIR. 
>> I BELIEVE I HAD THE FLOOR. 
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN FOR 
RECOGNIZING ME. 
I HAVEN'T BEEN IN AS MANY 
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS AS SOME 
OF MY COLLEAGUES, BUT THIS IS 
THE FIRST CONFIRMATION HEARING 
FOR A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
I'VE SEEN ACCORDING TO MOB 
RULE. 
WE HAVE RULES IN THE SENATE. 
WE HAVE RULES ISN'T THE GNAT. 
WE HAVE NORMS FOR DECORUM . YOU 
HAVE GIVEN THEM A CHANCE TO ASK 
QUESTIONS FOR 50 MINUTES. 
EVERY ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES CAN 
STEP OUT HERE AND TALK TO THE 
PRESS AND MAKE WHATEVER 
COMMENTS THEY WANT TO THE PRESS 
AND TELL THE WORLD HOW THEY 
FEEL ABOUT THIS. 
BUT THE FACT IS, IT'S HARD TO 
TAKE IT SERIOUSLY WHEN EVERY 
SINGLE ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN 
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR OPPOSITION 
TO THIS NOMINEE EVEN BEFORE 
TODAY'S HEARING. 
SO IT'S HARD TO TAKE SERIOUS 
ISLY THEIR CLAIM THAT SOMEHOW 
THEY CAN'T DO THEIR JOB BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE BEEN DENIED ACCESS TO 
ATTORNEY CLIENT OR EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE DOCUMENTS WHEN THEY 
HAVE MADE UP THEIR MIND BEFORE 
THE HEARING. 
THERE IS NOTHING FAIR ABOUT 
THAT. 
AND WE WOULD JUST ASK FOR AN 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO 
THIS NOMINEE APPS THE QUESTIONS 
THAT WE HAVE. 
AND I THINK THAT IS HOW WE 
OUGHT TO PROCEED. 
I HOPE WE WILL. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, CAN I BE 
RECOGNIZED TO RESPOND 
SPECIFICALLY TO THAT COMMENT? 
THERE IS PRECEDENT HERE. 
THERE ARE RULES THAT CAN GUIDE 
US. 
WE'RE ASKING FOR THOSE RULES TO 
BE FOLLOWED. 
IN THE PAST, OUR COLLEAGUES ON 
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE HAVE ASKED 
FOR A POSTPONEMENT OF THESE 
COMMITTEE PROCEEDINGS ON 
NOMINATIONS WHEN DOCUMENTS HAVE 
BEEN DENIED ON TWO OCCASIONS 
FROM SENATOR SESSIONS FROM THEN 
SENATOR SESSIONS AND SENATOR 
KYLE. 
THOSE REQUESTS WERE GRANTED. 
WE'RE ASKING SIMPLY THAT, THAT 
PRECEDENT BE FOLLOWED, MR. 
CHAIRMAN. 
FAR FROM MOB RULE, FAR FROM 
CONTEMPT OF THE PROCESS. 
WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING FOR RESPECT 
HERE TO THE NORMAL REGULAR 
ORDER. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> GO AHEAD. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I WOULD LIKE 
TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL ISSUE ONE MORE 
TIME. 
YOU HAVE EXPLAINED YOUR POINT 
OF VIEW. 
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW. 
THE CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY WHO IS MY 
FRIEND AND I RESPECT SAYS HIS 
REASON FOR DESIGNATED 147,000 
PAGES AS COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE CONDITION 
THAT BILL BURKE IMPOSED ON THE 
PROVISION OF THE DOCUMENTS. 
WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS IN MY 
OFFICE, MEETING WITH US, I 
ASKED HIM WHO IS BILL BURKE? 
BY WHAT AUTHORITY CAN HE 
RESTRICT THE INFORMATION GIVEN 
TO THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE? 
IS HE A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE? 
NO ONE KNEW THIS MYSTERIOUS 
BILL BURKE WHO IS FILTERING 
THESE DOCUMENTS. 
I FIGURED SINCE THE NOMINEE 
CARRIES A CONSTITUTION IN HIS 
POCKET, THERE MUST BE SOME 
REFERENCE TO BILL BURKE. 
IN ARTICLE TWO, SECTION TWO. 
BUT IT JUST SAYS ADVICE AND 
CONSENT OF THE SENATE. 
IT DOESN'T INCLUDE MR. BURKE. 
BY WHAT AUTHORITY IS THIS MAN 
HOLDING BACK HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS FROM THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE? 
WHO IS HE? 
WHO IS PAYING HIM? 
SO COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL IS 
BEING DETERMINED BY A MAN, A 
PRIVATE ATTORNEY, AND WE DON'T 
KNOW WHO HE WORKS FOR, OR WHO 
HE IS ACCOUNTABLE TO. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, IN THE PAST WHEN 
WE WENT INTO COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL, IT WAS IN A 
DISCREET, SPECIFIC AREA OF 
CONCERN INVOLVING A HANDFUL OF 
WORDS. 
OR ACCUSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN 
MADE IN A DOCUMENT. 
WE WERE CAREFUL TO DO IT ON A 
BIPARTISAN BASIS. 
THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE 
HERE. 
WHERE 140,000 CASES HAVE BEEN 
DESIGNATED BY BILL BURKE IS 
OUTSIDE OF THE REACH OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
THAT IS A FURTHER EXAMPLE OF 
WHY THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS GONE 
ASTRAY. 
I THINK YOUR EXPLANATION 
IGNORES THAT. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> WHO WANTS THE FLOOR? 
>> THE NEW SENATOR. 
>> GO AHEAD. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
CAN YOU TELL ME AGAIN HOW MANY 
DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED. 
>> 488,000 OTHER THAN 28,000 
PAGES THAT JUSTICE KAVANAUGH 
HAS SOME HEADED INCLUDING HIS 
OWN JUDICIAL OPINIONS. 
>> NUMBER TWO, ARE WE IN 
EXECUTIVE SESSION OR NOT? 
>> WE'RE HAVING A HEARING ON 
THE NOMINATION OF A NOMINEE FOR 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
>> YES, SIR I GOT THAT. 
>> WE'RE NOT IN EXECUTIVE 
SESSION. 
>> AT NUMBER THREE,S AT SOME 
POINT WILL WE GET TO HEAR FROM 
THE NOMINEE? 
>> HOPEFULLY IT WAS GOING TO BE 
BEFORE 2:30. 
IT WILL PROBABLY BE LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON NOW. 
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> CAN I ASK MY COLLEAGUES ON 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE HOW 
LONG YOU WANT TO GO ON WITH 
THIS? 
I'M NOT GOING TO ENTERTAIN ANY 
OF THE MOTIONS YOU ARE MAKE. 
WE'RE NOT IN EXECUTIVE SESSION. 
AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO LEVEL 
WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
DO YOU WANT THIS TO GO ON ALL 
DAY? 
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN PATIENT. 
I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF HAVING A 
MOB RULE SESSION. 
NOW IF WE HAVE A MOB RULE 
SESSION, IT'S BECAUSE THE 
CHAIRMAN'S NOT RUNNING THE 
COMMITTEE PROPERLY. 
BUT SINCE EVERY ONE OF YOU ON 
THAT SIDE OF THE AISLE EXPECT 
FOR SENATOR BOOKER, SENATOR 
HARRIS NEW TO THE COMMITTEE 
SAID DURING JUSTICE GORSUCH 
HEARING, EVERY ONE OF YOU 
PREFERENCED YOUR COMMENTS ON 
HOW FAIR I WAS IN RUNNING THAT 
HEARING. 
NOW THIS IS THE SAME CHUCK 
GRASSLEY THAT RAN THE GORSUCH 
HEARING. 
I WOULD LIKE TO RUN THIS 
HEARING THE SAME WAY IF YOU 
WILL GIVE ME THE COURTESY OF 
DOING IT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> HOW LONG DO YOU WANT TO GO 
ON? 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE 
MORE POINT BEFORE WE PROCEED. 
THE ACCUSATION THAT THIS IS A 
MOB RULE HEARING WAS MADE BY 
YOUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE STATE 
OF TEXAS. 
I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN 
CONDUCTING THIS IN A 
RESPECTFUL, APPROPRIATE, AND 
DELIBERATE WAY. 
MY CONCERNS THAT I WANT TO 
RENEW GIVEN THE EXCHANGE YOU 
JUST HAD WITH SENATOR LEAHY WHO 
HAS PARTICIPATED IN OR PRESIDED 
OVER ANY MORE CURRENTLY SERVING 
MEMBER I BELIEVE WAS OVER HOW 
THE DOCUMENT REQUEST WAS 
HANDLED FOR NOW JUSTICE KAGAN. 
A REQUEST WAS SENT TO THE 
NATIONAL ARCHIVES. 
RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN TRIED 
TO WORK WITH YOU TO SEND AN 
IDENTICAL REQUEST TO THE 
NATIONAL ARCHIVES. 
AND BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH THE 
QUESTIONING, MR. CHAIRMAN, I 
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SETTLED 
HEART WHY YOU CHOSE TO DIRECTLY 
COMMUNICATE TO THE ARCHIVES AND 
NOT RESPOND TO THE RANKING 
MEMBERS REQUEST. 
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE 
RAISED ISSUES ABOUT AN 
UNPRECEDENTED COMMITTEE PROCESS 
BY ALCOHOL DOCUMENTS WERE 
BLOCKED, BY WHICH THEY WERE 
CONSIDERED CLASSIFIED, AND BY 
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN BLOCKED FROM 
BEING ABLE TO CHAIR THEM WITH 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OR ASK 
QUESTIONS BASED ON THEM. 
THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED. 
THAT IS WHY AS YOU PUT IT THIS 
SIDE SEEKS TO RAISE HERB EWES 
TO ESTABLISH GROUND RULES 
BEFORE WE PROCEED. 
>> YOU ASKED AN APPROPRIATE 
QUESTION. 
I HAVE AN ANSWER. 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL SATISFY 
YOU OR NOT. 
THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE THE LEAST 
USEFUL IN UNDERSTANDING HIS 
LEGAL VIEWS AND THE MOST 
SENSITIVE TO THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH. 
AND LET ME EMPHASIZE THE MOST 
SENSITIVE TO THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH. 
THE STAFF SECRETARY SERVES AS 
AN INBOX, AN OUTBOX TO THE OVAL 
OFFICE. 
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE 
OPPORTUNITIES TO ASK THE 
NOMINEE HIMSELF WHAT HE DID 
THEN, BUT I'M GIVING YOU MY 
JUDGMENT ABOUT BEING A PERSON 
THAT PRIMARILY WAS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR MANAGING THE PAPER THAT 
CROSSES THE PRESIDENT'S DESK. 
HIS JOB AND IF I'M WRONG HE CAN 
SATISFY YOU OTHERWISE IN YOUR 
QUESTIOS YOU WANT TO ASK HIM. 
BUT HIS JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THE 
PRESIDENT SEES THE ADVICE OF 
OTHER ADVISORS NOT AS STAFF 
SECRETARY PROVIDING HIS OWN 
ADVICE. 
ONE OF PRESIDENT CLINTON'S 
STAFF SECRETARIES TODD STERN 
DESCRIBES THE JOB THIS WAY. 
I QUOTE, THE STAFF SECRETARY'S 
JOB IS NOT TO INFLUENCE THE 
PRESIDENT BUT INSURE HE GETS A 
BALANCED DIET OF VIEWPOINTS 
FROM ALL RELEVANT PEOPLE ON THE 
STAFF. 
YOU ARE CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO 
PUT YOUR THUMB ON THE SCALE 
BETWEEN OPTIONS. 
REVIEWING JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
STAFF SECRETARY DOCUMENTS WOULD 
TEACH US NOTHING ABOUT HIS 
LEGAL VIEWS. 
FOR THAT WE HAVE THE HUNT 307 
OPINIONS THAT HE WROTE AND THE 
HUNDREDS MORE JOINED TOTALING 
MORE THAN 10,000 PAGES OF 
JUDICIAL WRITINGS. 
WE ALSO HAVE MORE THAN 17,000 
PAGES OF SPEECHES, ARTICLES, 
TEACHING MATERIALS, AND OTHER 
MATERIALS THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
ATTACHED TO HIS 120 PAGE 
WRITTEN RESPONSE WHICH I THINK 
WAS A JUDICIARY'S QUESTIONNAIRE 
WAS PROBABLY THE MOST ROBUST 
QUESTIONNAIRE EVER SUBMITTED TO 
A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 
WE ALSO HAVE MORE THAN 480,000 
PAGES OF E-MAILS AND OTHER 
DOCUMENTS FROM JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S SERVICE AS AN 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH LAWYER. 
THIS IS A HALF MILLION PAGES OF 
PAPER. 
MORE THAN THE LAST FIVE 
CONFIRMED SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEES COMBINED. 
AND IN ADDITION, TO NOT 
SHEDDING LIGHT ON KAVANAUGH'S 
LEGAL VIEWS, THE STAFF 
SECRETARY DOCUMENTS ARE VERY 
SENSITIVE TO THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH. 
LET'S EMPHASIZE THAT WORD 
SENSITIVE. 
THESE DOCUMENTS COP TAPE HIGHLY 
-- CONTAIN HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL 
ADVICE, INCLUDING NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVICE THAT WENT FROM 
THE PRESIDENT TO HIS ADVISORS. 
IT WOULD THREATEN THE CANDOR OF 
FUTURE ADVICE TO PRESIDENTS IF 
ADVISORS KNEW THEIR ADVICE 
WOULD BE BROADLY DISCLOSED. 
SENATORS HAVE MORE DOCUMENTS 
FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH THAN ANY 
NOMINEE IN THE SENATE HISTORY. 
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS INSISTENT ON 
GETTING STAFF DOCUMENTS. 
I THINK WAS A WAY OF NOT HAVING 
THIS HEARING TAKE PLACE AT THIS 
PARTICULAR TIME. 
SO CAN I PROCEED MEMBERS OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS? 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, IF I CAN BE 
RECOGNIZED. 
>> IF I'M DONE CAN I PROCEED TO 
MY OPENING STATEMENT? 
>> I WILL DEFER TO MY 
COLLEAGUES. 
AS A POINT OF MY INFORMATION, 
WE SENT A LETTER TO YOU SEVEN 
DAYS AGO. 
REGARDING THE COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF THE 
DOCUMENTS AND ASKED THAT THEY 
WOULD NOT BE DESIGNATED 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL. 
AS ANOTHER POINT OF 
INFORMATION, IT IS MY 
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE 6-
7 MILLION PAGES OF DOCUMENTS 
REGARDING THE NOMINEE. 
AND IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING WITH 
ALL DUE RESPECT, MR. CHAIRMAN, 
THAT YOU HAVE REQUESTED 10-15% 
OF THE TOTAL. 
I APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE A 
LOT OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS. 
BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS 
CONVERSATION IN THE CONTEXT OF 
THE TOTAL. 
AND THE FACT THAT WE'VE ONLY 
BEEN GIVEN BY YOUR REQUEST 10-
15% OF THOSE DOCUMENTS. 
AND MY FINAL POINT IS THIS. 
THIS IS A HEARING ABOUT WHO 
WILL SIT ON THE HIGHEST COURT 
OF OUR LAND. 
THIS IS A HEARING THAT IS ABOUT 
WHO WILL SIT IN A HOUSE THAT 
SYMBOLIZES OUR SYSTEM OF 
JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY. 
AND SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE INTEGRITY 
OF OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IS 
THAT WE HAVE DUE PROCESS AND WE 
HAVE TRANSPARENCY. 
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE PUBLIC 
COURTROOMS. 
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE 
REQUIREMENTS IN COURTS OF LAW 
AND IN OUR COUNTRY. 
THAT THERE WILL BE 
TRANSPARENCY. 
THAT BOTH PARTIES WILL BE GIVEN 
ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION. 
WE CAN ARGUE THEN AS TO THE 
WEIGHT OF THE DOCUMENTS AND THE 
SIGNIFICANCE, BUT NOT AS TO 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE 
ADMISSIBLE. 
SO I OBJECT. 
I ASK THAT WE RENEW AND REVISIT 
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL'S MOTION TO 
SUSPEND OR MY MOTION TO 
POSTPONE THIS HEARING. 
THANK YOU. 
>> OKAY. 
THANK YOU. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> I APPRECIATE THE COURTESY OF 
THE DEMOCRATS FOR ME TO 
PROCEED. 
>> MAY I JUST HAVE ONE LAST 
OPPORTUNITY. 
>> PLEASE GO AHEAD. 
>> WITH MY MOTION. 
I APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME THE 
FLOOR. 
I'VE MADE A MOTION THAT IS 
PROPERLY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. 
THE CHAIRMAN SAID EARLIER THAT 
HE HAS NEVER BEEN THROUGH A 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS LIKE THIS 
ONE. 
THE REASON IS, THAT NO ONE 
ADMINISTRATION IN THE PAST HAS 
ENGAGED IN THIS KIND OF 
CONCEALMENT. 
THAT IS THE REASON. 
VERY SIMPLY. 
IT IS NOT THE CHAIRMAN'S DOING. 
NECESSARILY. 
IT IS THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT 
HAS CONCEALED AND HIDDEN 
DOCUMENTS FROM US AND FROM THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
AND SO I RENEW MY MOTION THAT 
WE ADJOURN SO THAT WE CAN 
ACCESS THE DOCUMENTS WE NEED, 
REVIEW THEM IN A DELIBERATE AND 
THOUGHTFUL WAY. 
MUCH HAS BEEN DONE FOR 
COLLEAGUES IN THE PAST WHEN 
THEY HAVE REQUESTED IT AND IS 
REQUIRED UNDER RULE FOUR OF OUR 
RULES. 
THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT WE 
BE IN EXECUTIVE SESSION TO 
FOLLOW THIS RULE, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WE 
FOLLOW OUR RULES, THAT WE 
PROCEED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
THOSE NORMS AND I KNOW THAT THE 
CHAIRMAN HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR 
OPEN GOVERNMENT, FOR WHISTLE 
BLOWERS, FOR SUNLIGHT AS THE 
BEST DISINFECTANT. 
WE NEED SOME SUNLIGHT IN THIS 
PROCESS. 
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
I AGAIN RENEW MY MOTION TO 
ADJOURN WHICH HAS BEEN SECONDED 
BY SENATOR WHITEHOUSE. 
>> DENIED BECAUSE WE ARE NOT IN 
EXECUTIVE SESSION. 
I WILL PROCEED. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, BEFORE YOU 
PROCEED. 
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE 
CORRECTION. 
THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION AS TO 
WHITE HOUSE STAFF SECRETARIES 
DO. 
TWO PAST SECRETARIES WROTE AN 
OPED TITLED STAFF SECRETARIES 
ARE NOT TRAFFIC STOPS. 
STOP TREATING KAVANAUGH LIKE HE 
WAS ONE. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HIMSELF HAS 
ACKNOWLEDGED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
A TIME THAT HE WAS WHITE HOUSE 
STAFF SECRETARY SO WHY, MR. 
CHAIRMAN, YOU AND THE OTHERS ON 
YOUR SIDE KEEP SAYING THAT THIS 
IS A NOTHING KIND OF A JOB. 
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM 
THE TRUTH. 
AND THIS IS WHY WE ARE SO 
ADAMANT ABOUT REQUESTING THESE 
DOCUMENTS THAT THE JUDGE 
HIMSELF, THE NOMINEE HIMSELF 
HAS SAID WE'RE AMONG THE MOST 
INFORMATIVE TIME OF HIS ADULT 
LIFE. 
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> OF COURSE, THAT IS WHY WE 
HAVE THIS HEARING. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
>> WE DON'T HAVE THE DOCUMENTS. 
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL HAVE IS 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER EVERY 
QUESTION ABOUT HIS ROLE IN 
ALMOST ANYTHING HE'S DONE IN 
HIS LIFETIME, I ASSUME. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, MAY I BE 
RECOGNIZED? 
>> YEAH. 
WILL YOU BE THE LAST ONE OR DO 
WE GO ON ALL AFTERNOON? 
>> I CAN'T SPEAK FOR MY 
COLLEAGUES. 
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE I HAVE 
RESPECT FOR. 
WE ARE EXPECTED TO EVALUATE A 
NOMINEE. 
WHO HAS A VAST RECORD. 
AND IF YOU LOOK AND A LOT OF 
NUMBERS HAVE BEEN CITED. 
10,000 HERE. 
40,000 HERE. 
100,000 HERE. 
BUT AN ENTIRE BODY OF HIS 
RECORD, WE ONLY HAVE 10% OF HIS 
RECORD WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO 
EVALUATE. 
90% HAS BEEN WITHHELD FROM 
SENATORS. 
WE ARE ASKING TO EVALUATE A 
CANDIDATE, TO HAVE INTELLIGENCE 
QUESTIONS AND INSIGHTS INTO HIS 
RECORD, BUT WE ONLY HAVE 10% OF 
THAT RECORD. 
WE CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT THE 
NUMBERS OF DOCUMENTS, HUNDREDS 
OF THOUSANDS, TEN THOUSANDS. 
BUT WE ARE ABOUT TO PROCEED 
WITH A HISTORIC HEARING. 
WE'RE ABOUT TO PROCEED TOWARD 
HAVING A HEARING ON SOMEONE 
HAVING A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT 
ON THE MOST IMPORTANT COURT IN 
THE LAND. 
THAT WILL EFFECT SO MANY AREAS 
OF AMERICAN LIFE. 
FROM CIVIL RIGHTS TO WOMEN 
RIGHTS TO ACCESS TO HEALTH 
CARE. 
AND WE ARE GOING INTO THIS ONLY 
HAVING 10%, ACCESS TO 10% OF 
THE BODY OF WORK OF THIS MAN'S 
CAREER. 
THAT SEEMS TO ME COMMON SENSE. 
90% IS MISSING RIGHT NOW. 
JUST COMMON SENSE SAYS WE 
SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO 
THOROUGHLY EVALUATE THIS 
PERSON. 
WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING 
OUT OF THE ORDINARY. 
OTHER CANDIDATES HAVE COME 
BEFORE. 
BUT WE HAVE GOTTEN FAR MORE FOR 
EVERY SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE. 
FAR MORE THAN JUST 10%. 
MY COLLEAGUE TALK ABOUT WHAT 
OUR DUTY TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 
IS. 
IT IS TO EVALUATE A CANDIDATE 
ON THEIR BODY OF WORK. 
WE'RE NOT EVEN GETTING RELEASE 
OF THAT. 
WHY? 
BECAUSE SOME POLITICAL PERSON. 
NOT THE PERSON WHO HOLDS PUBLIC 
OFFICE. 
NOT BECAUSE -- IT'S UNPRECEDENT 
TO THINK THIS COMMITTEE HAS 
SEEDED ITS ROLE. 
HERE WE ARE ABOUT TO GO FORWARD 
WITH 10% OF THIS PERSON'S 
RECORD TO EVALUATE. 
TO BASE OUR QUESTIONS ON TO 
INVESTIGATE. 
90% IS BEING WITHHELD. 
JUST COMMON SENSE WOULD SAY 
THAT IS NOT FAIR, THAT IS NOT 
RIGHT. 
IT UNDER MINES OUR ABILITY TO 
DO OUR JOB. 
IT IS JUST PLAIN WRONG. 
 
>> ONE OF THE SENATORS MOST 
SOLEMN CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES IS 
TO PROVIDE ADVICE AND CONSENT 
TO THE PRESIDENT ON THE 
NOMINATION OF SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICES. 
WE ARE HERE THIS WEEK TO HEAR 
FROM BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
TO HEAR ABOUT HIS EXCEPTIONAL 
QUALIFICATIONS, HIS RECORD TO 
DEDICATION TO THE RULE OF LAW, 
AND HIS DEMONSTRATED 
INDEPENDENCE AND HIS 
APPRECIATION OF THE IMPORTANCE 
OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. 
INDEED TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL 
LIBERTY, THE FRAMERS DESIGNED A 
GOVERNMENT OF THREE COEQUAL 
BRANCHES STRICTLY SEPARATING 
LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE AND 
JUDICIAL POWERS. 
THE FRAMERS INTENDED FOR THE 
JUDICIARY TO BE IMMUNE FROM THE 
POLITICAL PRESSURES THE OTHER 
TWO FACE. 
THAT IS SO THAT JUDGES WOULD 
DECIDE CASES ACCORDING TO THE 
LAW AND NOT ACCORDING TO 
POPULAR OPINION. 
NOW 230 YEARS AFTER RATIFY CASE 
OUR LEGAL SYSTEM IS -- IT 
PROVIDES OUR PEOPLE STABILITY, 
PREDICTABILITY, PROTECTION OF 
OUR RIGHTS AND EQUAL ACCESS TO 
JUSTICE BUT THIS IS ONLY 
POSSIBLE WHEN JUDGES ARE 
COMMITTEE -- COMMITTED TO THE 
RULE OF LAW. 
OUR LEGAL SYSTEM IS BUILT ON 
JUDGES THAT THEIR ROLE IS 
LIMITED TO DECIDING CASES AND 
CONTROVERSY. 
A GOOD JUDGE EXERCISES 
HUMILITY, AND MAKES DECISIONS 
ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC FACTS OF 
THE CASE AND OF COURSE 
ACCORDING TO THE LAW. 
A GOOD JUDGE NEVER BASES 
DECISIONS ON HIS PREFERRED 
POLICY PREFERENCES. 
A GOOD JUDGE ALSO HAS COURAGE, 
RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE AN 
INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY TO 
RESTRAIN JUDGES WHEN THAT 
GOVERNMENT EXCEEDS LAWFUL 
AUTHITY. 
PRESIDENT ANDREW JACKSON SAID 
QUOTE, ALL THE RIGHTS SECURED 
TO THE CITIZENS UNDER THE 
CONSTITUTION ARE WORTH NOTHING 
AND A MERE BUBBLE EXPECT 
GUARANTEED TO THEM BY AN 
INDEPENDENT AND VIRTUOUS 
JUDICIARY. 
END OF QUOTE. 
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES ARE AN 
INDEPENDENT ARE VERY IMPORTANT 
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE 
APPROPRIATE ROLE OF JUDGES. 
AS I SEE IT AND I EXPECT MANY 
OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL AGREE, 
THE ROLE OF THE JUDGE IS TO 
APPLY THE LAW AS WRITTEN EVEN 
IF THE LEGAL RESULT IS NOT ONE 
THAT THE JUDGE PERSONALLY 
LIKES. 
JUSTICE SCALIA IS OFTEN BEING 
QUOTED BECAUSE HE WAS FOND OF 
SAYING IF A JUDGE ALWAYS LIKES 
THE OUTCOME OF THE CASES HE 
DECIDES, HE IS PROBABLY DOING 
SOMETHING WRONG. 
I DON'T WANT JUDGES WHO ALWAYS 
REACH A LIBERAL RESULT OR 
CONSERVATIVE RESULT. 
I WANT A JUDGE WHO RULES THE 
LAW THE WAY THE LAW REQUIRES. 
JUDGES MUST LEAVE LAW MAKING TO 
THE CONGRESS. 
THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF 
THE PEOPLE. 
JUDGES AND JUSTICES HAVE 
LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS. 
THEY CAN'T BE VOTED OUT OF 
OFFICE IF THEY LEGISLATE. 
WHEREAS IF CONGRESS LEGISLATES 
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE DON'T 
LIKE, THEN YOU CAN VOTE THEM 
OUT OF OFFICE. 
THAT IS WHY THEY ARE TO 
INTERPRET LAW AND NOT MAKE LAW. 
SOME HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW 
OF WHAT A JUDGES ROLE SHOULD 
BE. 
ACCORDING TO THIS FEUD, JUDGES 
SHOULD DECIDE CASES BASED UPON 
PARTICULAR OUTCOMES IN ORDER TO 
ADVANCE THEIR POLITICS. 
BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T 
WANT THEIR JUDGES TO PICK SIDES 
BEFORE THEY HEAR A CASE. 
THEY WANT A JUDGE THAT RULES 
BASED UPON WHAT THE LAW 
COMMANDS. 
THIS IS THE REASON WHY ALL 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES SINCE 
AGAINST BURG HAVE DECLINED TO 
OFFER THEIR PERSONAL OPINIONS 
ON THE CORRECTNESS OF 
PRECEDENT. 
SEEKING ASSURANCES FROM A 
NOMINEE ON HOW HE WILL VOTE IN 
CERTAIN CASES OR HOW HE VIEWS 
CERTAIN PRECEDENT UNDER MINES 
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND 
ESSENTIALLY ASKS FOR A PROMISE 
IN EXCHANGE FOR A CONFIRMATION 
VOTE. 
IT'S UNFAIR AND UNETHICAL 
INDEED WHAT -- I EXPECT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, IN FACT, IT'S MY 
ADVICE TO HIM, TO FOLLOW THE 
EXAMPLE SET BY JUSTICE AGAINST 
BURG AND ALL NOMINEES THAT 
FOLLOWED HER. 
JUSTICE KAGAN WHEN ASKED ABOUT 
ROE V WADE SAID THE FOLLOWING, 
QUOTE, I DO NOT BELIEVE IT 
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO COMMENT 
ON THE MERITS OF ROE V WADE 
OTHER THAN TO SAY IT'S A 
SETTLED LAW ENTITLED TO 
PRESIDENTIAL WEIGHT. 
THE APPLICATION OF ROE TO 
FUTURE CASES AND EVEN ITS 
CONTINUED VALIDITY ARE ISSUES 
LIKELY TO COME BEFORE THE COURT 
IN THE FUTURE. 
END OF QUOTE. 
SENATORS WERE SATISFIED WITH 
THESE ANSWERS UNPRECEDENT. 
SO SENATORS SHOULD BE SATISFIED 
IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH ANSWERS 
SIMILARLY. 
THIS IS MY 15th SUPREME COURT 
CONFIRMATION HEARING INSURANCE 
I JOINED THE COMMITTEE IN 1981. 
31 YEARS AGO DURING MY FOURTH 
SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION 
HEARING, LIBERAL OUTSIDE GROUPS 
AND THEIR SENATE ALLIES ENGAGED 
IN UNPRECEDENTED SMEAR CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST JUDGE ROBERT. 
THE BORING OF ROBERT BORK 
TAUGHT SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS 
THAW CAN DEMONIZE SPECIAL 
INTEREST GROUPS BASED ON THEIR 
WORLD VIEW. 
WORSE CHARACTER ASSASSINATIONS 
PROVED AN EFFECTIVE TACTIC 
NEARLY SINKING JUSTICE CLARENCE 
THOMAS' APPOINTMENT FOUR YEARS 
LATER. 
BUT HE ALSO SAID, CONTINUING TO 
QUOTE, BY CONFIRMING JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, THE SENATE CAN GO 
SOME WAY TOWARD ATONING FOR 
SHAMEFUL TREATMENT OF JUSTICE 
ROBERT BORK 31 YEARS AGO. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS ONE OF THE 
MOST QUALIFIED NOMINEE. 
A GRADUATE OF YALE LAW SCHOOL, 
CLERKING THREE FEDERAL JUDGES 
INCLUDING A MAN HE NOMINATED TO 
REPLACE. 
HE SPENT ALL BUT THREE YEARS OF 
HIS CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE 
AND HAS SERVED AS A JUDGE FOR 
12 YEARS ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT. 
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FEDERAL 
CIRCUIT COURT. 
HE HAS ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPRESSIVE RECORDS FOR A LOWER 
COURT JUDGE IN THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
IN AT LEAST A DOZEN SEPARATE 
CASES, THE SUPREME COURT 
DOCUMENTED POSITIONS ADVANCED 
BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION 
WHOSE ASSESSMENT DEMOCRATIC 
LEADERS HAVE CALLED THE GOLD 
STANDARD OF JUDICIAL 
EVALUATIONS RATED JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH UNANIMOUSLY WELL 
QUALIFIED. 
HE HAS WRITTEN ELOQUENTLY THAT 
BOTH JUDGES AND FEDERAL 
AGENCIES ARE BOUND ARE BOUND BY 
THE LAW, CONGRESS. 
HE HAS CRITICIZED THOSE THAT 
SUBSTITUTE THEIR OWN JUDGMENT 
ABOUT WHAT A STATUE SHOULD SAY 
AND WHAT THE STATUE ACTUALLY 
SAYS. 
AFTER PRESIDENT NOMINATED JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, I SAID THIS WOULD BE 
THE MOST SURREAL AND 
TRANSFORMATION HEARING. 
I SAY THAT DOCUMENT EVEN 
REGARDING ALL THE DISCUSSION WE 
HAVE HAD THIS MORNING. 
IT HAS PROVEN TO BE FROM JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S AUTHORING 307 
OPINIONS JOINED HUNDREDS MORE 
AMOUNTING TO MORE THAN 10,000 
PAGES. 
IF SUBMITTED, HE SUBMITTED 
17,000 PAGES OF SPEECHES, 
ARTICLES, AND OTHER MATERIALS 
TO THE COMMITTEE ALONG WITH 
THIS 120 PAGE WRITTEN RESPONSE 
TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE THAT 
COMMITTEE SET OUT. 
THESE ADD UP TO 27,000 PAGES OF 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S RECORD 
ALREADY AVAILABLE TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
AND WE RECEIVED JUST SHY OF A 
HALF A MILLION PAGES OF E-MAILS 
AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FROM JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S SERVICE AS AN 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH LAWYER WHICH 
IS MORE THAN WE RECEIVED FOR 
THE LAST FIVE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEES. 
EVERY ONE OF THESE MORE THAN 
483 PAGES OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE TO ANY 
SENATOR 24/7. 
I PUSHED FOR FEDERAL OFFICIALS 
TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPEDITE 
PUBLIC EXPOSURE PROCESS UNDER 
FEDERAL LAW SOME ALL AMERICANS 
HAVE ONLINE ACCESS TO MORE THAN 
290,000 PAGES OF THESE RECORDS 
RIGHT NOW ON OUR COMMITTEE 
WEBSITE. 
IN SHORT, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
HAVE UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS AND 
MORE MATERIALS TO REVIEW JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH THAN EVER HAVE HAD 
FOR A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 
AND TO SUPPORT THE REVIEW OF 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S HISTORIC 
VOLUME OF MATERIAL, I'VE WORKED 
TO INSURE THAT MORE SENATORS 
HAVE ACCESS TO MORE MATERIAL 
THAN EVER. 
SINCE SO MUCH ESTERIZE OF MY 
STATEMENT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED 
THIS MORNING BY WHAT THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID AND I'VE 
ANSWERED A LOT OF IT, I WILL 
PUT THE LAST SEVEN PAGES OF MY 
STATEMENT IN THE RECORD AND I 
WILL ASK SENATOR FEINSTEIN IF 
SHE HAD MORE TO SAY ON HER 
OPENING STATEMENT. 
IF SHE DOESN'T, I WILL GO TO 
SENATOR. 
>> I WILL PROBABLY TRAM DATE IT 
EVEN SO. 
BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY 
IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE AS WELL 
AS THE JUDGE, THE NOMINEE 
UNDERSTAND HOW STRONGLY WE FEEL 
AND WHY WE FEEL THAT WAY. 
I AMOUNT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT ONE OF THE BIG DECISIONS 
THAT WE HAVE THE BELIEF THAT 
ALTHOUGH YOU TOLD SENATOR 
COLLINS THAT YOU BELIEVE IT WAS 
SETTLED LAW, THE QUESTION IS 
REALLY DO YOU BELIEVE IT'S 
CORRECT LAW. 
AND THAT IS ROE V WADE. 
I WAS IN THE 50s AND 60s ACTIVE 
BUT FIRST A STUDENT AT 
STANFORD. 
I SAW WHAT HAPPENED. 
I SAW WHAT HAPPENS TO WOMEN 
WHEN THEY BECAME PREGNANT. 
I SAT AS AN APPOINTEE OF 
GOVERNOR BROWNS ON THE TERMS 
CITING AND PAROLING AUTHORITY 
FOR WOMEN IN 
. 
>>> THOSE STATISTICS THAT HAVE 
BEEN PUT OUT ARE REALLY 
HORRENDOUS. 
FOR YOU, THEPRESIDENT THAT 
NOMINATED YOU,   HAS SAID I 
WILL NOMINATE SOMEONE  WHO IS 
ANTI-CHOICE AND PRO GUN.      
AND WE BELIEVE  WHAT HE SAID.   
WE CANNOT FIND THE DOCUMENTS  
THAT ABSOLVE FROM THAT 
CONCLUSION.    
SO,  WHAT WOMEN HAVE WON 
THROUGH ROE AND A HOST OF 
PRIVACY CASES  YET TO BE ABLE 
TO CONTROL THEIR OWN 
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM TO HAVE 
BASIC PRIVACY RIGHTS REALLY 
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT TO 
THIS SIDE OF THE ISLE. 
AND IHOPE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
ISLE AS WELL.     
LAST YEAR  YOU DRAFTED A 
DISSENT IN GARZAV -- AND THAT'S 
A CASE WHERE A YOUNG WOMAN IN 
TEXAS, I BELIEVE, WAS SEEKING 
AN ABORTION. 
IN THAT YOU ARGUEDTHAT EVEN 
THOUGH THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD 
COMPLIED WITH THE TEXAS 
PARENTAL NOTIFICATION LAW SHE 
SHOULD NONETHELESS BE BARRED.   
IN MAKING YOUR ARGUMENT,  YOU 
IGNORED, AND I BELIEVE, 
MISCHARACTERIZED A SUPREME 
COURT PRECEDENT. 
YOUREASONED THAT JANE DOE 
SHOULD NOT BE UNABLE TO 
EXERCISE HER RIGHT TO CHOOSE, 
BECAUSE SHE DID NOT HAVE FAMILY 
AND FRIENDS  TO MAKE HER 
DECISION.     
THE ARGUMENT REWRITES SUPREME 
COURT PRECEDENT.    
AND IF ADOPTED WE BELIEVE, 
WOULD REQUIRE COURTS TO 
DETERMINE  WHETHER A YOUNG 
WOMAN HAD A SUFFICIENT SUPPORT 
NETWORK  WHEN MAKING HER 
DECISION.     
EVEN IN CASES  WHERE SHE HAS 
GONE TO COURT.    
THIS REASON  WE BELIEVE, I 
BELIEVE, DEMONSTRATES  THAT YOU 
ARE WILLING TO DISREGARD 
PRECEDENT.    
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE  BECAUSE 
JUST SAYING SOMETHING SETTLED 
LAW, IT REALLY IS, IS IT 
CORRECT LAW?    
UM,  THE IMPACT OF OVERTURNING 
ROE IS MUCH BROADER THAN A 
WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. 
IT'S ABOUTPROTECTING THE MOST 
PERSONAL DECISIONS WE ALL MAKE 
FROM GOVERNMENT INTRUSION.     
ROE IS ONE IN A SERIES OF CASES 
THAT UPHELD AN INDIVIDUAL'S 
RIGHT TO DECIDE WHO TO MARRY, 
IT'S NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S 
RIGHT, WHERE TO SEND YOUR 
CHILDREN TO SCHOOL, THE 
GOVERNMENT CAN'T GET INVOLVED; 
WHAT KIND OF MEDICAL CARE YOU 
CAN RECEIVE AT THE END OF LIFE 
AS WELL AS WHETHER AND WHEN TO 
HAVE A FAMILY. 
AND IDEEPLY BELIEVE THAT ALL 
THESE CASES  SERVE AS A WORK OF 
PRIVACY RIGHTS THAT PROTECT ALL 
AMERICANS FROM OVERINVOLVEMENT 
OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THEIR 
LIVES.    
AND TO ME, THAT'S 
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT.     
NEXT I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS 
PRESIDENT'S PROMISE TO APPOINT 
A NOMINEE BLESSED BY THE NRA. 
INREVIEWING  YOUR JUDICIAL 
OPINIONS AND DOCUMENTS, IT'S 
PRETTY CLEAR THAT YOUR VIEWS GO 
WELL BEYOND SIMPLY BEING PRO-
GUN. 
AND I'D LIKE TOSTRAIGHTEN THAT 
OUT. 
IT'S MYUNDERSTANDING THAT 
DURING A LECTURE AT NOTRE DAME 
LAW SCHOOL YOU SAID YOU WOULD 
BE THE QUOTE, FIRST TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE  THAT MOST OTHER 
LOWER JUDGES -- COURT JUDGES 
HAVE DISAGREED WITH YOUR VIEWS 
ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT. 
FOR EXAMPLE, IN DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA VHELLER YOU WROTE THAT 
UNLESS GUNS WERE REGULATED 
EITHER AT THE TIME OF THE 
CONSTITUTION WAS WRITTEN OR 
TRADITIONALLY THROUGHOUT 
HISTORY THEY CANNOT BE 
REGULATED NOW.    
IN YOUR OWN WORDS GUN LAWS ARE 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNLESS THEY 
ARE QUOTE, TRADITIONAL OR 
COMMON IN THE UNITED STATES.    
YOU CONCLUDE THAT HAD BANNING 
ASSAULT WEAPONS IS 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN 
BANNED.    
AND THIS LOGIC  MEANS THAT EVEN 
AS WEAPONS BECOME MORE ADVANCED 
AND MORE DANGEROUS, THEY CANNOT 
BE REGULATED.     
A CONSERVATIVE JUDGE FROM THE 
SEVENTH CIRCUIT CONCLUDED THAT 
HAD THAT REASONING WAS ABSURD 
AND POINTED OUT THAT A LAW'S 
EXISTENCE CAN'T BE THE SOURCE 
OF ITS OWN CONSTITUTIONAL 
VALIDITY. 
I'M LEFT WITH THE FACT THAT 
YOUR REASONING IS FAR OUTSIDE 
THE MAINSTREAM OF LEGAL THOUGHT 
AND THAT IT SIR PASSES THE 
VIEWS OF JUSTICE IS A LEAH WHO 
WAS CLEARLY A PRO GUN JUSTICE. 
EVENHE UNDERSTOOD THAT WEAPONS 
THAT ARE LIKE M 16 RIFLES OR 
WEAPONS THAT ARE MOST USEFUL IN 
MILITARY SERVICE CAN IN FACT, 
BE REGULATED. 
AND THERE'S NOQUESTION THAT 
ASSAULT WEAPONS  LIKE THE AR 
15, WERE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED 
TO BE LIKE THE M 16.   
UNITED STATES MAKES UP 4%  OF 
THE WORLDWIDE POPULATION.   
BUT WE OWN 42% OF THE WORLD'S 
GUNS.     
SINCE 2012, WHEN 20, 1ST 
GRADERS AND 6 SCHOOL EMPLOYEES 
WERE KILLED AT SANDY HOOK 
ELEMENTARY THERE HAVE BEEN 273 
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.    
THIS IS AN AVERAGE OF 5 
SHOOTINGS EVERY MONTH, AND A 
TOTAL  OF 462 CHILDREN, 
TEENAGERS, TEACHERS AND STAFF 
-SHOT  AND 152 KILLED.    
I CARE A LOT ABOUT THIS. 
I AUTHORED ASSAULTWEAPONS 
LEGISLATION THAT BECAME LAW FOR 
10 YEARS    
AND I'VE SEEN THE DESTRUCTION. 
IFTHE SUPREME COURT  WERE TO 
ADOPT YOUR REASONING , I FEAR 
THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS  WOULD 
CONTINUE TO GROW. 
ANDCITIZENS WOULD BE RENDERED 
POWERLESS IN ENACTING SENSIBLE 
GUN LAWS.  
SO THIS IS A BIG PART OF MY 
VERY HONEST CONCERN.      
YOU'RE BEING NOMINATED FOR A 
PRIVATE TALL SEAT. 
IT WOULD LIKELY BE THEDECIDING 
VOTE ON FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES. 
SO  DURING YOUR TIME IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE WHEN YOU WERE STAFF 
SECRETARY, SOME PEOPLE REGARD 
IT AS KIND OF A MONITOR 
MONITORING THINGS GOING IN AND 
GOING OUT, BUT I THINK IT'S 
MUCH MORE. 
AND YOUYOURSELF HAVE SAID THAT 
THAT'S THE PERIOD  OF MY 
GREATEST GROWTH, AND  SO YOU 
LOOK AT IT AND THE ONLY WAY WE 
CAN LOOK AT IT IS TO UNDERSTAND 
THE DOCUMENTS. 
AND IT'S VERY, VERYDIFFICULT.   
UM, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO 
MUCH TIME, BUT  WE'VE HEARD A 
LOT OF NOISE .  BEHIND THE NOISE
IS REALLY A VERY SINCERE BELIEF 
THAT IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO KEEP 
IN THIS COUNTRY  WHICH IS MULTI 
ETHNIC, MULTI RELIGIOUS, MULTI 
ECONOMIC  A COURT THAT REALLY 
SERVES THE PEOPLE.    
AND SERVES THIS GREAT 
DEMOCRACY. 
AND  THAT'S MY WORRY.     
THAT'S MY WORRY.      
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 
STATEMENT AND ANSWERING THE 
QUESTIONS. 
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.   
. 
>> SENATOR HATCH FOR 10 
MINUTES. 
>>WELL, THANK YOU. 
FIRST I'DLIKE TO THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR TREMENDOUS WORK IN 
ORGANIZING THIS HEARING. 
THIS HAS BEEN THEMOST THOROUGH 
SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION 
PROCESS THAT I'VE EVER 
PARTICIPATED IN. 
WE'VERECEIVED MORE THAN TWICE 
AS MANY DOCUMENTS FOR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AS FOR ANY SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE IN HISTORY.     
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.      
WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PAGES OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
OPINIONS, SPEECHES, AND OTHER 
WRITINGS. 
THIS HAS BEEN ANEXHAUSTIVE 
PROCESS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU 
FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON IT. 
NOW, TO OUR WITNESS, JUDGE
KAVANAUGH, IT'S GOOD TO SEE 
YOU.     
I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR A LONG TIME. 
THIS IS MY15TH AND FINAL 
SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION 
HEARINGS. 
IPARTICIPATED IN THE 
CONFIRMATION OF EVERY CURRENT 
JUSTICE ON THE COURT. 
I'VE PARTICIPATED IN THE
CONFIRMATION OF OVER HALF OF 
ALL FEDERAL JUDGES NOW SERVING. 
I KNOW A GOOD NOMINEE WHEN I 
SEE ONE AND YOU ARE A GREAT 
NOMINEE. 
IDON'T THINK THERE'S ANY 
QUESTION ABOUT IT. 
I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR ALONG TIME. 
I REMEMBER WHEN YOUFIRST CAME 
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE.    
BACK IN 2004, FOR YOUR FIRST 
CONFIRMATION HEARING. 
I WAS THECHAIRMAN OF THIS 
COMMITTEE AT THE TIME.     
I GOT TO KNOW YOU WELL.     
I WAS IMPRESSED BY YOUR 
INTELLECT, LEGAL ABILITY AND 
INTEGRITY, ALL OF WHICH WERE 
VERY MUCH NOTABLE. 
AT ONLY39 YEARS OF AGE YOU KNEW 
MORE ABOUT THE LAW THAN MOST 
LAWYERS WHO HAVE PRACTICED FOR 
A LIFETIME. 
YOU'VE BEEN ANOUTSTANDING 
JUDGE. 
YOU'VEEARNED THE -- THE RESPECT 
OF YOUR COLLEAGUES.     
YOU'VE LEARNED THE RESPECT OF 
THE SUPREME COURT AS WELL.     
AS YOU KNOW THE SUPREME COURT 
HAS  ADOPTED THE POSITIONS AND 
YOUR OPINIONS NO LESS THAN 13 
TIMES. 
THAT'S -- THAT'S SOMETHING 
NOBODY CAN REALLY ARGUE 
AGAINST.    
YOU'VE AUTHORED LANDMARK 
OPINIONS ON  THE SEPARATION OF 
POWERS, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, AND 
NATIONAL SECURITY.    
YOU SERVED AS A MENTOR TO 
DOZENS OF CLERKS AND HUNDREDS 
OF LAW STUDENTS, MALE AND 
FEMALE. 
YOUR STUDENTSSOME OF WHOM DID 
NOT SHARE YOUR PHILOSOPHY. 
YOUR STUDENTREVIEWS ARE OFF THE 
CHARTS FAVORABLE EVEN BY THOSE 
WHO MAY NOT HAVE COMPLETELY 
AGREED WITH YOUR APPROACHES.    
ON SOME MATTERS. 
YOU VOLUNTEERIN YOUR COMMUNITY. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, ASK FOR ORDER. 
OKAY, YOU VOLUNTEER INTHE 
COMMUNITY, COACH YOUTH 
BASKETBALL, THE SORT OF PERSON 
MANY OF US WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 
AS A FRIEND AND A COLLEAGUE. 
YOUALSO APPARENTLY LIKE TO -- 
LIKE TO EAT PASTA WITH KETCHUP, 
BUT NOBODY'S PERFECT. 
THIS BEINGPOLITICS AND BEING A 
SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION 
HEARING BY DEMOCRATIC 
COLLEAGUES ACTUALLY  -- I'VE 
GOT TO ADMIT THIS IS --    MY 
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES CAN ADMIT 
THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY A GOOD 
JUDGE AND A GOOD PERSON AS 
WELL.   
THEY HAVE -- THEY HAVE TO TURN 
THE VOLUME UP TO 11, AND TRY TO 
PAINT YOU AS ONE OF THE 4 HORSE 
MAN OF THE APOCALYPSE. 
ANYONE THAT KNOWS YOU KNOWS 
THAT THAT'S RIDICULOUS. 
THE AMERICANPEOPLE WILL SEE 
THAT YOU'RE A SMART NORMAL 
PERSON THAT JUST SO HAPPENS TO 
HAVE BEEN NO, MA'AM NATURE TO 
THE HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND. 
SO HERE ARE THEFACTS:  JUDGE
KAVANAUGH IS ONEOF THE MOST 
DISTINGUISHED JUDGES -- MR. 
CHAIRMAN I THINK WE OUGHT TO 
HAVE THIS LOUD MOUTH REMOVED. 
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TOPUT UP WITH 
THIS KIND OF STUFF. 
I HOPE SHE'S NOT A LAW STUDENT. 
. 
>> I -- NOW THAT WE HAVE QUIET 
I'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN THAT I  
ADVISED  2 YEARS AGO THAT AT MY 
HEARINGS I EXPECTED THE POLICE 
TO DO THEIR JOB AND I EXPECT 
THE COMMITTEE TO GO ON, BUT IF 
YOU DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE  -- 
>> I'M GOING TO CONTINUE. 
>>  WE'LL -- OKAY. 
GO AHEAD. 
>> HERE ARE THE FACTS:  JUDGE
KAVANAUGH IS ONE OF THE MOST 
DISTINGUISHED JUDGES IN THE 
ENTIRE COUNTRY.    
HE HAS SERVED FOR OVER 12 YEARS 
NOW IN THE U.S. COURT OF 
APPEALS TO THE D.C. CIRCUIT. 
THE D.C.CIRCUIT IS OFTEN 
REFERRED TO AS THE SECOND 
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND 
BECAUSE IT HEARS MANY IMPORTANT 
CASES.    
INVOLVING AGENCY ACTION AND THE 
SEPARATION OF POWERS. 
DURINGHIS TIME ON THE BENCH 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS HEARD OVER 
A THOUSAND CASES.    
HE'S WRITTEN MORE THAN 300 
OPINIONS.    
HIS OPINIONS SPAN NEARLY 5,000 
PAGES.     
WHAT'S REMARKABLE ABOUT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S JUDICIAL RECORD IS 
NOT JUST ITS LENGTH.   
BUT ITS DEPTH AND ITS QUALITY. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HASBEEN A TRUE 
THOUGHT LEADER. 
HE'S WRITTEN POWERFUL OPINIONS 
ON THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND 
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. 
HE'S SHOWNTHAT HE BRINGS A FAIR 
MINDED APPROACH TO QUESTIONS OF 
CRIMINAL LAW AND EMPLOYMENT 
LAW. 
ON ALMOST EVERY ISSUE OF 
CONSEQUENCE HE'S MADE 
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS AND 
WON RESPECT FROM BOTH SIDES OF 
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. 
THECOMMITTEE HAS RECEIVED 
LETTERS FROM FORMER CLERKS, 
FORMER COLLEAGUES, FORMER 
STUDENTS, AND FORMER 
CLASSMATES, ALL ATTESTING TO 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S CHARACTER AND 
QUALIFICATIONS SOME OF WHOM ARE 
DEMOCRATS AND MEMBERS OF THE 
SUPREME COURT BAR HAVE ALL 
WRITTEN IN STRONG SUPPORT OF 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION. 
THE AUTHORS OF THESE LETTERS 
EMPHASIZE THAT THEY HAVE 
DIFFERENT POLITICAL VIEWS AND 
THAT THEY DO NOT AGREE ON EVERY 
SUBJECT. 
BUT TO A PERSON THEYSPEAK OF 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S INTEGRITY AND 
JUDGMENT  AND THEY ENDORSE HIS 
NOMINATION.    
I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONE 
LETTER IN PARTICULAR FROM 18 OF 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S FORMER WOMEN 
LAW CLERKS. 
THAT'S ALL  -- HIS FORMER WOMEN 
CLERKS ALL OF THEM HONOR NOT 
PRECLUDED BY THEIR CURRENT OR 
PENDING EMPLOYMENT FROM SIGNING 
THE LETTER. 
THEYWRITE THAT QUOTE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN ONE OF THE 
STRONGEST ADVOCATES FOR WOMEN 
LAWYERS UNQUOTE. 
THEY DETAIL THEMENTORING AND 
ENCOURAGEMENT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
HAS GIVEN THEM. 
THEY SAY IT IS QUOTE NOT AN 
EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT WE 
WOULD NOT BE THE PROFESSORS, 
PROSECUTORS, PUBLIC OFFICIALS 
E ARE TODAY WITHOUT 
ENCOURAGEMENT AND UNWAVERING 
SUPPORT UNQUOTE.    
THESE FORMER CLARKS SPAN THE 
POLITICAL DIVIDE AND THEN WENT 
ONTO CLERK FOR LIBERAL 
JUSTICES. 
THAT SHOWS YOU THE HIGH REGARD 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS ACROSS THE 
SPECTRUM. 
REPUBLICAN ANDDEMOCRATIC 
APPOINTED JUDGES ALIKE HAVE 
HIRED HIS FORMER CLERKS. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH ISNO -- HE IS 
NO EXTREMIST, HE IS  
THOUGHTFUL, FAIR-MINDED JUDGE 
WHO IS WELL WITHIN THE JUDICIAL 
NAME STRAIN. 
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE LETTER 
THE COMMITTEE RECEIVED FROM 
OVER 40 MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME 
COURT BAR SUPPORTING JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION.     
AMONG THE SIGNERS ARE PEOPLE 
LIKE -- LIKELY IS A BLATT AND 
KATHLEEN SULLIVAN. 
THESE ARENATIONALLY RENOUNED 
ATTORNEYS WHO PRACTICE 
FREQUENTLY BEFORE THE SUPREME 
COURT AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF 
APPEALS AND THEY'RE NOT 
CONSERVATIVES. 
TOTHE CONTRARY THEY ARE AMONG 
THE MOST PROMINENT LIBERAL 
ATTORNEYS  AT THE BAR TODAY.    
AND IN THE COUNTRY.     
BUT THEY KNOW JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  
THEY KNOW HIS WORK, THEY KNOW 
HIS CHARACTER, THEY KNOW THAT 
HE IS AN OUTSTANDING JUDGE. 
AND THEYKNOW THAT HE WILL MAKE 
AN OUTSTANDING JUSTICE.    
IF WE COULD JUST GET THE 
POLITICS OUT OF THIS I THINK WE 
COULD ALL AGREE  THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH IS AN INDISPUTEABLY 
QUALIFIED NOMINEE WITH STRONG 
BACKING IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY 
WHO IS WELL WITHIN JUDICIAL 
MAINSTREAM. 
GO ASK ANYONE WHOPRACTICES 
REGULARLY BEFORE THE SUPREME 
COURT WHO DOESN'T HAVE A 
PARTISAN AGENDA AND THEY'LL 
TELL YOU JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS 
EXACTLY THE PERSON WE SHOULD 
WANT TO HAVE ON THE COURT. 
BILLCLINTON'S PERSONAL LAWYER 
WROTE TO COMMITTEE URGING 
SUPPORT FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION.   
HERE'S WHAT WE -- HERE'S WHAT 
HE INTENDED TO SAY QUOTE, AS A 
WASHINGTON ATTORNEY I CAN 
ATTEST TO THE HIGH ESTEEM IN 
WHICH THE BAR HOLDS JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
LAWYERS LOVE ARGUINGBEFORE HIM. 
FOR GOOD REASON BECAUSE THEY 
KNOW HE WILL APPROACH EVERY 
CASE WITH AN OPEN MIND UNQUOTE. 
THEN IT CONTINUES QUOTE HE IS 
THE MOST QUALIFIED PERSON ANY 
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT COULD 
POSSIBLY HAVE NOMINATED.    
 
PASSING UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
CONFIRM  
BUT ALSO UNDERMINE CIVILITY AND 
POLITICS TWICE OVER. 
.
AGAIN THIS IS PRESIDENT 
CLINTON'S PERSONAL LAWYER 
DURING CLINTON'S PRESIDENCY WHO 
LITIGATED AGAINST JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
THOSE WHO KNOWJUDGE KAVANAUGH 
HOLD HIM IN HIGHEST REGARD. 
THIS IS TRUE OFBOTH REPUBLICANS 
AND DEMOCRATS. 
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE ALL THESE 
INTERESTS GROUPS SCREAMING FROM 
THE SIDELINES AND PUTTING 
PRESSURE ON MY DEMOCRATIC 
COLLEAGUES TO MAKE THIS HEARING 
ABOUT POLITICS, TO MAKE IT 
ABOUT PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING 
EXCEPT JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND HIS 
QUALIFICATIONS.     
WE HAVE FOLKS WHO WANT TO RUN 
FOR PRESIDENT, WHO WANT THEIR 
MOMENT IN THE SPOTLIGHT, WHO 
WANT THAT COVETED TV CLIP. 
FRANKLY I WISH WE COULD DROP 
ALL THE -- DROP ALL THE 
NONSENSE. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS 
UNQUESTIONABLY QUALIFIED, HE'S 
ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY 
RESPECTED JUDGES IN THE 
COUNTRY, WELL WITHIN THE 
JUDICIAL MAINSTREAM. 
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO ARGUE 
OTHERWISE WANTS TO BANISH HALF 
THE COUNTRY FROM THE 
MAINSTREAM. 
SO JUDGE, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE 
TODAY. 
I'M SORRY YOU'RE GOINGTO HAVE 
TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE 
NONSENSE ABOUT TO COME YOUR 
WAY, BUT I HOPE YOU DO IT WELL. 
YOU'RE SMART, YOU'RE SMART AND 
YOU'RE A FUNDAMENTALLY DECENT 
GOOD PERSON. 
ANYONE WHOACTUALLY KNOWS YOU 
KNOWS THAT TO BE TRUE.      
MR. CHAIRMAN, I DON'T KNOW THAT 
THE COMMITTEE SHOULD HAVE TO 
PUT UP WITH THIS TYPE OF  
INCIDENTS THAT'S GOING ON IN 
THIS ROOM TODAY. 
AND FRANKLYTHESE PEOPLE 
SHOULDN'T EVEN BE ALLOWED 
. 
JUDGEKAVANAUGH, I'M PROUD OF 
YOU, I KNOW HOW GOOD YOU ARE, I 
KNOW YOU DESERVE THIS POSITION, 
I'M PROUD OF THE PRESIDENT FOR 
NOMINATING YOU AND FRANKLY I 
WISH YOU THE BEST BECAUSE WE'RE 
GOING TO CONFIRM YOU. 
>> OUT OF COURTESY TO RANKING 
MEMBER, SHE WANTS TO INTRODUCE 
PEOPLE HONOR IN THE AUDIENCE 
AND SO SHE CAN TAKE WHAT TIME 
SHE WANTS RIGHT NOW. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I'LL BE VERYFAST.

AND A MEMBER OF LITTLE ROCK. 
THANK YOU FOR THIS COURTESY. 
IREALLY APPRECIATE IT.    
. 
>> I WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY TO 
YIELD TO THE SENATOR FOR THAT.  
MR. CHAIRMAN, THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF 
RHETORIC, I THINK IT MIGHT 
SERVE THE  COMMITTEE WELL TO 
HAVE SOME REALITY.      
I'VE SERVED IN THE SENATE FOR 
44 YEARS.    
DURING THAT SPAN , ABLE TO VOTE 
ON 19 NOMINATIONS TO THE 
SUPREME COURT.      
I MENTIONED THIS  BECAUSE I 
HAVE A SENSE OF HISTORY.      
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT 44 
YEARS SO MUCH AT STAKE WITH A 
SINGLE SEAT, BUT I'VE ALSO 
NEVER SEEN SUCH A DANGEROUS 
RUSH TO FILL IT. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED HE 
WOULD ONLY NOMINATE JUDGES  TO 
THE SUPREME COURT  WHO WOULD 
OVERTURN  ROE VERSUS WADE.    
JUDGES WHO WOULD DISMANTLE THE 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, JUDGES WHO 
WOULD RE SHAPE OUR JUDICIAL 
PRE. 
IFTHAT'S NOT JUDICIAL ACTIVISM, 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. 
AND JUDGEKAVANAUGH WITH YOUR 
NOMINATION, THE PRESIDENT HAS 
MADE IS VERY CLEAR, THAT HE'S 
FOLLOWING THROUGH ON HIS 
PROMISES AND MANY OF US FEEL HE 
IS.      
IT SEEMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE 
INTRIGUED HIM FOR ANOTHER 
REASON, YOUR EXPANSIVE VIEW OF 
EXECUTIVE POWER AND EXECUTIVE 
IMMUNITY. 
YOU'VE TAKEN THEPOSITION THAT 
PRESIDENTS SHOULD NOT BE 
BURDENED WITH A CRIMINAL OR 
CIVIL INVESTIGATION WHILE IN 
OFFICE.      
 
NOW WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS  
DECLARED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS  
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
SHOULDN'T PROSECUTE 
REPUBLICANS.   
YOU KNOW, IT'S  -- IT'S ALICE 
IN WONDERLAND.     
I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE 
THAT YOUR VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT 
ESCAPED THE ATTENTION OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP  WHO SEEMS 
INCREASINGLY FIXATED ON HIS OWN 
BALLOONING LEGAL JEOPARDY.    
WHEN QUESTIONING YOU ABOUT 
THESE CONCERNS WE'LL CERTAINLY 
LOOK TO YOUR RECORD ON THE 
BENCH, ALL OF US REPUBLICANS 
AND DEMOCRATS AGREE THAT WE 
SHOULD.    
INDEED YOUR 12 YEARS ON THE 
D.C. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS 
WILL LOOM LARGE DURING THESE 
HEARINGS. 
BUT THEUNKNOWN LOOMS EVEN 
LARGER.     
BEFORE SITTING ON THE BENCH YOU 
WERE A POLITICAL OPERATIVE 
INVOLVED IN THE MOST POLITICAL 
AND PARTISAN CONTROVERSIES OF 
OUR TIME. 
DURING THIS TIME YOU SHARED 
YOUR PERSONAL VIEW ON ISSUES 
WITHOUT REGARD TO RESTRICTION 
IMPOSED BY PRECEDENT.    
AND IT'S PRECISELY THOSE VIEWS 
THAT ARE BEING HIDDEN FROM US 
TODAY. 
THECOMMITTEE'S SUPREME COURT 
HEARINGS ARE MEANT TO BE AN 
UNSPEERING EXAMINATION OF A 
NOMINEE TO A LIFETIME 
APPOINTMENT TO OUR HIGHEST 
COURT. 
THEY'RE INTENDED TO GIVETHE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE ALL, ALL, ALL 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A GENUINE 
OPPORTUNITY TO SCRUTINIZE THE 
NOMINEE'S JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY, 
AND CHARACTER. 
BECAUSE OF CONFIRMEDWITH A 
STROKE OF A PEN A NOMINEE MAY 
IMPACT THEIR LIVES FOR A 
GENERATION OR MORE. 
AND HOW FARWE'VE FALLEN. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH,SO MANY THINGS 
WRONG WITH THIS MIGHT TEE'S 
VETTING OF YOUR RECORD. 
IT IS HARD TO KNOWWHERE TO 
BEGIN. 
I'VE BEEN ONTHIS COMMITTEE IN 
BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC 
LEADERSHIP. 
I NEVER THOUGHT THECOMMITTEE 
WOULD SINK TO THIS.    
IN FACT,  YOU SHOULDN'T BE 
SITTING IN FRONT OF US TODAY.   
YOU SHOULD BE SITTING IN FRONT 
OF US ONLY AFTER WE'VE 
COMPLETED A REVIEW OF YOUR 
RECORD, YOUR VETTING IS LESS 
THAN 10% COMPLETE. 
IN CRITICAL WAYS OURCOMMITTEE 
IS ABANDONING ITS TRADITION OF 
VETTING SUPREME COURT NOMINEES. 
FIRST OURREPUBLICAN FRIENDS 
REFUSE TO REQUEST RECORDS FROM 
YOUR 3 YEARS AS WHITE HOUSE 
STAFF SECRETARY.     
EVEN THOUGH YOU  DESCRIBED 
THOSE AS THE MOST FORMATIVE FOR 
YOU AS A JUDGE.    
WHEN YOU PROVIDE ADVICE ON ANY 
ISSUE THAT MAY CROSS THE 
PRESIDENT'S DESK.   
NOW, WE KNOW  THOSE ISSUES 
INCLUDED ABORTION, SAME SEX 
MARRIAGE,    AND TORTURE, AND 
TORTURE. 
BUT 6 WEEKS AGO SENATE 
REPUBLICANS HELD A PRIVATE 
MEETING WITH THE WHITE HOUSE 
COUNSEL WHO IS HERE TODAY AND 
HOURS LATER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
WERE TOLD THOSE RECORDS WOULD 
BE OFF LIMITS.      
AND SECOND A STARK DEPARTURE 
FROM COMMITTEE PRECEDENT. 
THECOMMITTEE PRECEDENT I'VE 
SEEN FOR 44 YEARS. 
THE CHAIRMANSAID --  
NOT ONLY DID IT ADMIT ALL 1 
MILLION RECORDS FROM YOUR 3 
YEARS AS STAFF SECRETARY IT DID 
NOT EVEN REQUEST THE PRIVILEGED 
LAW. 
THAT MEANS THIS COMMITTEE IS IN 
THE DARK AS TO WHAT SPECIFIC 
DOCUMENTS  
AND WHY? 
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IS 
BEING HIDDEN. 
SUCH A MOVE ISSIMPLY -- 
 
TRANCE PARTNER. 
THIRD, TE ARCHIVESTOLD US 
TEXTED NOT PRODUCE THIS PARTIAL 
RECORDS REQUEST UNTIL THE END 
OF OCTOBER, THAT'S THE NON-
PARTISAN ARCHIVES.      
. 
>>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I DO NOT 
INTEND AT ANY POINT TO CONTINUE 
WITH WHAT I HAVE TO SAY WITH 
SUCH INTERRUPTIONS, I DON'T 
CARE WHOSE SIDE THEY'RE ON. 
NOW, THEARCHIVES HAVE SAID THEY 
COULD NOT PRODUCE THOSE PARTIAL 
RECORDS REQUEST UNTIL THE END 
OF OCTOBER.    
SURELY I WOULD THINK THAT THE 
UNITED STATES SENATE COULD WAIT 
UNTIL THEN EVEN IF IT MEANS A 
SUPREME COURT WITH 8 JUSTICES 
FOR A SHORT TIME. 
AFTER ALL, SENATORREPUBLICANS  
ESTABLISHED THE TRADITION OF 
HAVING JUST 8 JUDGES, 8 
JUSTICES, THEY DID THAT WITH 
THEIR TREATMENT OF CHIEF JUDGE 
GARLAND AND SHOWED THEY WERE 
WILLING TO HAVE PATIENCE WITH 
FILLING SUPREME COURT VACANCIES 
WHEN THE FIRST TIME EVER THEY 
REFUSE  TO HAVE A VOTE ON THE 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE EITHER UP 
OR DOWN.     
DURING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
YEAR.    
AND I'VE BEEN HERE WHEN THEY 
HAVE HAD  IN THE PAST SUCH 
VOTES. 
BUT  REPUBLICANS CAST ASIDE THE 
ARCHIVES, SWAPPED THE REVIEW 
PROCESS     
FOR A PARTISAN ONE.     
AND I THINK YOU ONLY HAVE TO 
LOOK AT WATERGATE TO SEE WHY WE 
HAVE THAT NON-PARTISAN PROCESS. 
IT'S FOLLOWED EVERY NOMINATION 
SINCE WATER GATE UNTIL TODAY.   
AND MY QUESTION SILL RECURS, 
WHAT IS BEING HIDDEN? 
AND WHY?
EVERY WHITE HOUSE RECORD THAT 
WE'VE RECEIVED WAS HAND PICKED 
BY YOUR DEPUTY IN THE BUSH 
WHITE HOUSE, A HYPER CONFLICTED 
LAWYER OF LAW REPRESENTS A HALF 
DOZEN TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS  HONOR UNDER 
INVESTIGATION BY PROSECUTION IN 
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.      
AND THESE LAWYERS DECIDED WHICH 
OF YOUR RECORDS THE SENATE, BUT 
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET 
TO SEE.     
FORTH COME THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT 
HAD BEEN PROVIDED CONTAIN 
APPARENT ALTERATIONS AND 
OMISSIONS WITH ZERO 
EXPLANATION.      
NO COURT IN THIS COUNTRY 
CERTAINLY NO COURT THAT I EVER 
ARGUED CASES BEFORE WOULD 
ACCEPT THIS AS A LEGITIMATE 
DOCUMENT PRODUCTION.      
AND UNITED STATES SENATE 
SHOULDN'T EITHER.      
AND 5TH, MORE THAN 40% OF THE 
DOCUMENTS WE HAVE RECEIVED 
ALMOST 190,000 PAGES ARE 
CONSIDERED COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL BY THE CHAIRMAN.   
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY THEN 
THERE'S NOT EVEN A CONCEIVABLE 
ARGUMENT RESTRICTIVE.      
COMPARE THIS TO THE 860 
DOCUMENTS DESIGNATED COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL AND THAT THE 
REQUEST WAS MADE BY THE NON-
PARTISAN ARCHIVES NOT BY THIS 
COMMITTEE.      
AND BESIDE 99% OF OUR RECORDS. 
AND 6 AND FINALLY WELEARN THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CLAIMING 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER AN 
ADDITIONAL 102,000 PAGES OF 
YOUR RECORDS.      
SUCH A BLANKET ASSERTION 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE HANDLE IS 
SIMPLY UNHEARD OF IN THE 
HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. 
THE REASONIT'S UNHEARD OF IS 
BECAUSE IT IS SO OUTRAGEOUS. 
THE LAST TIME APRESIDENT 
ATTEMPTED TO HIDE HIS SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE'S RECORDS BY 
INVOKING EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE 
WAS WHEN PRESIDENT REAGAN DID 
THIS.      
BUT THEN REPUBLICANS AND 
DEMOCRATS CAME TOGETHER , WE 
DEMANDED THE DOCUMENTS BE 
RELEASED AND THE PRESIDENT SAID 
OKAY, AND THEY WERE RELEASED.   
BOY, HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED.    
AND 7TH TO DATE WE'VE RECEIVED 
LESS THAN HAVE OF THE 
CHAIRMAN'S PARTIAL RECORDS 
REQUEST, MEANING WE'RE MOVING 
FORWARD EVEN THOUGH WE'VE 
RECEIVED A FRACTION OF THE 
RECORDS EVEN REPUBLICANS CLAIM 
THEY NEEDED TODAY VET YOUR 
NOMINATION JUST A FEW WEEKS 
AGO. 
AND THEN WE RECEIVED AN 
ADDITIONAL 42,000 PAGES A FEW 
HOURS AGO.     
THE NOTION THAT ANYONE HAS 
PROPERLY REVIEWED THEM OR SEEN 
THEM AT ALL IS LAUGHABLE. 
IT'SLAUGHABLE. 
IT DOESN'T PASS THEGIGGLE TEST. 
THAT ALONE WOULDBE REASON TO 
POSTPONE DURING NORMAL TIMES, 
BUT NOTHING ABOUT THIS IS 
NORMAL. 
ALL TOLD,  ONLY 4%, 4% OF YOUR 
WHITE HOUSE RECORD  HAS BEEN 
SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC.    
ONLY 7%  HAS BEEN MADE 
AVAILABLE TO THIS COMMITTEE.    
THE REST  REMAINS HIDDEN FROM 
SCRUTINY.      
COMPARE THIS TO THE 99% OF 
JUSTICE'S RECORD THAT WAS 
AVAILABLE  
AS A RESULT OF THE BIPARTISAN 
PROCESS I RAN WITHIN RANKING 
MEMBER JEFF SESSIONS. 
WHEN SENATOR SESSIONSAND I 
REQUESTED IT AND WE GOT 99%.    
WHAT IS BEING HIDDEN AND WHY?   
AND IF I'VE NOT BEEN CLEAR I 
WOULD BE SO NOW, TODAY THE 
SENATE IS NOT SIMPLY PHONING IN 
OUR BIDDING OBLIGATION, WE'RE 
DISCARDING IT.    
IT'S NOT ONLY SHAMEFUL, IT'S A 
SHAM.     
I FELT ON THE DAY WHEN I TOOK  
MY OATH OF OFFICE THE FIRST 
TIME 44 YEARS AGO,    I WAS 
TOLD BY BOTH THE REPUBLICAN AND 
DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP WITH THE 
SENATE, PEOPLE I HIGHLY 
RESPECTED  THE SENATE SHOULD BE 
AND CAN BE THE CONSCIOUS OF THE 
NATION.      
I'VE REPRESENTED VERMONT HERE 
FOR 44 YEARS, I SERVED WITH 
PRIDE HERE BELIEVING THAT THE 
SENATE CAN BE AND SHOULD BE  
THE CONSCIOUS OF THE NATION.    
TODAY WITH THIS HEARING, IT IS 
NOT.   
BEING THE CONSCIOUS OF THE 
NATION.     
AND FROM THE BITS AND PIECES OF 
YOUR RECORD WE'VE RECEIVED, IT 
APPEARS YOU PROVIDED MISLEADING 
TESTIMONY ABOUT YOUR 
INVOLVEMENT  AND CONTROVERSIAL 
ISSUES IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE 
DURING YOUR PREVIOUS 
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS, 
MISLEADING TESTIMONY. 
I ASKEDYOU ABOUT THESE CONCERNS 
LAST MONTH.  
AND I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WE 
RETURN.     
FEARS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL 
NOT KNOW THE FULL TRUTH UNTIL 
YOUR RECORD IS PUBLIC AND 
UNFORTUNATELY REPUBLICANS HAVE 
DONE THEIR BEST AND YOU HAD YOU 
A GAPING HOLES SPANNING 
MULTIPLE YEARS OF YOUR CAREER, 
DEEPLY INFLUENCED BY YOUR OWN 
WORDS  YOU'RE THINKING AS 
JUDGE. 
ANY CLAIM THIS HAS BEEN A 
TRANSPARENT PROCESS, THIS IS 
THE MOST INCOMPLETE, MOST 
PARTISAN, LEAST TRANSPARENT 
VETTING FOR ANY SUPREME COURT  
NOMINEE I HAVE EVER SEEN AND 
I'VE SEEN MORE OF THOSE THAN 
ANY PERSON SERVING TODAY.    
FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I HOPE YOU 
USE IT TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS 
DIRECTLY, CLEARLY AND HONESTLY 
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
HAVE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT HOW 
YOUR CONFIRMAION WILL AFFECT 
THEIR LIVES. 
I'LL CON CLUE WITH THIS,THE 
SUPREME COURT IS A GUARANTEE OR 
OF OUR LIBERTIES AND OUR 
REPUBLIC. 
FEW I WOULD ARGUE AREWORTHY OF 
TAKING THE SEAT ONLY THOSE WITH 
UNIMPEACHABLE INTEGRITY, ONLY 
THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT TRUTH IS 
MORE IMPORTANT THAN PARTY, ONLY 
THOSE COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING 
THE RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS, 
NOT JUST THOSE IN POWER.    
AS YOU KNOW,    AS SCRIBBED 
ABOVE THE COURT'S ENTRANCE IS 
EQUAL, EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. 
FOR THE MILLIONS OFAMERICANS 
FEARFUL THAT THEY'RE ON THE 
VERGE OF LOSING HARD FOUGHT 
RIGHTS THAT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN IT IS TODAY 
FRANKLY, AS A MEMBER OF THE 
SUPREME COURT BAR AND AS A 
UNITED STATES SENATOR I FEEL 
IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE AT RISK. 
THANK YOU.     
. 
>> HOW RIDICULOUS IT IS SO SAY 
THAT WE DON'T HAVE RECORDS THAT 
IT TAKES TO DETERMINE THIS 
PERSON'S QUALIFIED TO BE ON THE 
SUPREME COURT WHEN ALL THE 
DOCUMENTS WE HAVE  ADD UP TO 
MORE THAN WE HAVE HAD FOR THE 
LAST 5 SUPREME COURT NOMINEES.  
HOW DID WE MAKE THOSE DECISIONS 
FOR THOSE OTHER 5? 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, IF I COULD 
RESPOND TO THAT POINT, YOU'RE 
NOT GIVING THE WHOLE PICTURE 
SURE, 90% OF THE DOCUMENTS WE 
HAVEN'T SEEN. 
>> AND I'LL BE GLAD TO RESPOND 
TO THAT. 
>> YOU WOULDN'T HIRE AN INTERN 
WITH ONLY 90% OF THEIR RESUME. 
>> SENATOR -- 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN, 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WELCOME TO YOU 
AND YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS. 
I'M AMAZED AT THE POKER FACES 
I'VE SEEN ON THE FRONT ROW 
DURING ALL THIS UNLIKE ANYTHING 
I'VE SEEN BEFORE IN A 
CONFIRMATION HEARING.    
IN MY VIEW IT'S NOT BECAUSE  
YOUR OPPONENTS DON'T KNOW 
ENOUGH ABOUT YOU, IT'S BECAUSE 
THEY DO KNOW ALL THEY NEED TO 
KNOW APPARENT TO OPPOSE YOUR 
NOMINATION.    
AND EVEN BEFORE YOU'VE HAD A 
CHANCE TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS 
INCLUDING THEIR QUESTIONS MANY 
OF THEM HAVE MADE UP THEIR 
MINDS, BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
HAVE NOT  BEEN INTRODUCED TO 
YOU BEFORE. 
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITYFOR ALL 
OF US TO ENGAGE IN A QUESTION 
AND ANSWER FORMAT THAT WILL 
HOPEFULLY ALUMINUM NATURE HOW 
IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE JUDGES 
TEETHERED TO TEXT OF THE LAWS 
PASSED BY CONGRESS, SIGNED BY 
THE PRESIDENT AS WELL AS THE 
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES.       
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
UNDERTAKES FEW MORE IMPORTANT 
TASKS THAN THE ONE BEFORE US 
TODAY. 
LAST YEAR THECOMMITTEE 
CONSIDERED AND ADVANCED THE 
NOMINATION OF JUSTICE NEIL 
GORSUCH IS ONE OF THE 
OUTSTANDING JUDICIAL NOMINEES 
WOULD PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
 
BUT 26 JUDGES TO THE APPEAL 
LATE COURTS ACROSS THE NATION, 
THIS INCLUDES 3 OUTSTANDING 
TEANS TO THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
COURT OF APPEALS. 
HISTORICALLY THE CONFIRMATION 
OF JUDGES TO THE HIGHEST COURTS 
WAS SOMEWHAT ROUTINE, ROUTINE. 
JUSTICE GORSUCH WAS UNANIMOUSLY 
CONFIRMED BY A SIMPLE VOICE 
VOTE TO THE COURT OF APPEALS. 
NOTONE SENATOR WHO VOTED 
AGAINST JUSTICE KENNEDY WHO 
BOTH YOU CLERKED FOR AND WHO 
YOU WILL SUCCEED ON THE COURT, 
NOT ONE SENATOR VOTED AGAINST 
JUSTICE SCALIA'S CONFIRMATION 
WHO YOU'VE CALLED A ROLE MODEL 
AND HERO THAT WAS BEFORE THEY 
WERE VIEWED AS POLICYMAKERS 
RATHER THAN FAIR AND NEUTRAL 
INTERA TERSE. 
TODAYI SUGGEST IT IS A 
WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO 
REEXAMINE THE PROPER ROLE FOR 
JUDGES UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION 
AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
LEGISLATORS AND JUDGES.     
AS JUSTICE GORSUCH WROTE BEFORE 
HE JOINED THE SUPREME COURT 
UPHOLDING AND ENFORCING THIS 
INSIDE WAS THE GREAT PROJECT OF 
THE LATE JUSTICE SCALIA'S 
CAREER. 
HEWOULD ALWAYS REMIND US THAT 
LEGISLATORS MAY APPEAL TO THEIR 
OWN MORAL CONVICTIONS AND 
CLAIMS ABOUT SOCIAL UTILITY.    
BUT JUDGES INSTEAD   CON STRIVE 
TO APPLY THE LAW AS IT IS 
LOOKING TO THE TEXT, STRUCTURE 
AND HISTORY, NOT TO DECIDE 
CASES BASED ON THEIR OWN MORAL 
CONVICTIONS OR THE POLICY 
CONSEQUENCES. 
SO THIS HEARINGIS A  
OUTSTANDING WAY  TO REMIND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE THE PROPER ROLE 
OF JUDGES UNDER OUR 
CONSTITUTION.     
OUR CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR A 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF LIMITED 
AND DELEGATED POWERS WITH THE 
BILL OF RIGHTS TO FURTHER 
PROTECT OUR INDIVIDUAL 
LIBERTIES. 
AS YOUKNOW THE LEGISLATURE TO 
ENACT LAWS, THE EXECUTIVE 
REPORTS THEM AND THE JUDICIAL 
BRANCH TO SETTLE DISPUTES ABOUT 
THE MEANING OF THOSE LAWS AND 
THE CONSTITUTION. 
OF COURSE THELEGISLATURE CAN 
CHANGE THE LAWS BUT ONLY AN 
AMENDMENT CAN CHANGE THE 
CONSTITUTION FOR THIS REASON 
HAMILTON WROTE IN THE 
FEDERALIST PAPERS -- MR. 
CHAIRMAN, COULD I PAUSE THERE 
UNTIL THE ROOM IS CLEARED? 
>> YEAH. 
>> THANK YOU. 
FOR THIS REASONHAMILTON WROTE 
IN THE FEDERALIST PAPERS THAT 
THE JUDICIARY WILL ALWAYS BE 
THE LEAST DANGEROUS BRANCH 
BECAUSE AS HE FAMOUSLY WROTE 
JUDGES WOULD HAVE NEITHER FORCE 
NOR WILL BUT MERELY JUDGMENT. 
TODAY THE COMMITTEEIS GATHERED 
TO CONSIDER WHETHER JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH MR. HONOR THAT ROLE 
AND WHETHER PROPERLY EXERCISE 
THE MODEST AND HUMBLE POWER OF 
JUDGMENT ENTRUSTED TO HIM UNDER 
OUR CONSTITUTION. 
I'MCONFIDENT THE SENATE 
 
LAWS OF THIS GREAT NATION AND I 
LOOK FORWARD TO HIM SUCCEEDING 
JUSTICE KENNEDY.    
ONE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE 
I'VE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH FOR ABOUT 18 YEARS 
AND I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST TO 
HIS SKILLS AS A LAWYER.       
. 
>>  MAY I PROCEED? 
>> YEAH. 
>> AS I WAS SAYING.       
WHEN I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF 
TEXAS I HAD A CHANCE TO ARGUE A 
COUPLE OF CASES IN FRONT OF THE 
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. 
ONE CASE JUDGE KAVANAUGH HELPED 
ME PREPARE FOR WAS ONE 
INVOLVING THE QUESTION OF 
SCHOOL PRAYER AT A HIGH SCHOOL 
FOOTBALL GAME.    
AFTER THAT I WAS PLEASE TODAY 
INTRODUCE JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO 
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHEN 
PRESIDENT BUSH FIRST NOMINATED 
HIM TO BE A JUDGE ON THE D.C. 
CIRCUIT. 
WHATI SAID BACK THEN STILL 
STANDS THE TEST OF TIME TODAY. 
HE HASA ACADEMIC AND 
PROFESSIONAL RECORD OF SERVICE. 
MANY WILLCITE HIS EDUCATION, 
CLERKSHIPS, HIS EXPERIENCE 
WORKING FOR THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH, BUT I THINK ONE OF THE 
MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS TO ME IS 
HE'S ALREADY  EXERCISED  
EXCELLENT JUDGMENT  IN MARRY 
AGO TEXAN.     
SO I KNOW HE'S A GOOD JUDGE.    
IN FACT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS ONE 
OF THE MOST RESPECTED JUDGES IN 
THE COUNTRY.     
I AM DISAPPOINTED  THAT DESPITE 
HIS QUALIFICATIONS AND 
OUTSTANDING RECORDS SO MANY OF 
OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE ISLE 
HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR OPPOSITION 
EVEN BEFORE HE WAS NOMINATED.   
SOME HAVE CLAIMED THAT YOU'VE 
TESTIFIED FALSELY WE'VE ALREADY 
HEARD THAT ALLUDED TO BEFORE 
THE COMMITTEE WHEN YOU WERE 
SERVING OUR COUNTRY IN THE BUSH 
WHITE HOUSE I HOPE YOU'LL HAVE 
A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN THE 
MISUNDERSTANDING ON THE PART 
.     
AND I SINCERELY HOPE THIS WEEK 
WE CAN ALL TAKE A DEEP BREATH. 
WE'RE NOT DOING VERYWELL SO FAR 
AND GET A GRIP AND TREAT THIS 
PROCESS WITH THE RESPECT  AND 
GRAVITY IT DEMANDS. 
AS OTHERS HAVE ALLUDEDTHE 
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION WHICH 
SOME CALL THE GOLD STANDARD 
HAVE UNANIMOUSLY RATED YOU AS 
WELL QUALIFIED FOR SERVICE ON 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
AS WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF 
LAWYERS AND JUDGES ACROSS THE 
SPECTRUM HAVE TALKED ABOUT YOUR 
QUALIFICATIONS AND SUNG YOUR 
PRAISES. 
I'M CONFIDENT AT THEEND OF THIS 
HEARING YOUR -- BODY OF WORK AS 
A JUDGE WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT 
YOU PROPERLY UNDER THE ROLE OF 
A JUDGE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION 
AND CONFIDENT THAT YOU'LL DID 
HE MEAN TRAIT THAT YOU'LL 
INTERPRET THE TEXT OF THE LAW 
AND CONSTITUTION AAPPLY THEM TO 
THE DISPUTES THAT COME BEFORE 
YOU. 
FINALLY JUDGE,I EXPECT WE'LL 
HAVE A CONVERSATION  OR 2 ABOUT 
THIS BOOK WHICH I CONTRIBUTED 
TO, AND , THE LAW OF JUDICIAL 
PRECEDENT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT 
THERE'S A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS 
BY MEMBERS OF THE SENATE ABOUT 
HOW YOU WERE -- YOU WILL REGARD 
PREVIOUSLY DECIDED CASES IN THE 
SUPREME COURT.   
AND I TRUST YOU'LL GIVE US A 
SCHOLARLY AND DETAILED 
EXPLANATION OF THAT. 
ANDDEMONSTRATE THAT MANY OF THE 
CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN 
EXPRESSED ABOUT A NEW JUSTICE 
COMING ON THE COURT IS SOMEHOW 
WIPING AWAY PREVIOUS DECISIONS  
SINGLE HANDEDLY NOT EVEN WITH 
THE HELP OF OTHER MEMBERS OF 
THE COURT IS JUST PLAIN 
RIDICULOUS, AND WE LOOK FORWARD 
TO ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS AND 
GETTING YOUR ANSWER. 
THANK YOUVERY MUCH.      
. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
BEING HERE TODAY. 
THIS IS A DIFFERENTHEARING.     
IT'S DIFFERENT IN WHAT'S 
HAPPENED IN THIS ROOM JUST THIS 
MORNING.     
WHAT WE'VE HEARD  IS THE NOISE 
OF DEMOCRACY, THIS IS WHAT 
HAPPENS IN A FREE COUNTRY WHEN 
PEOPLE CAN STAND UP AND SPEAK.  
AND NOT BE  JAILED, IMPRISONED, 
TORTURED OR KILLED BECAUSE OF 
IT.    
IT IS NOT MOB RULE.      
THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN IT 
IS UNCOMFORTABLE, I'M SURE IT 
WAS FOR YOUR CHILDREN, I HOPE 
YOU CAN EXPLAIN THIS TO THEM AT 
SOME POINT, BUT IT DOES 
REPRESENT WHAT WE ARE ABOUT IN 
THIS DEMOCRACY. 
WHY IS THISHAPPENING FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF 
COMMITTEE? 
ITHINK WE NEED TO BE HONEST 
ABOUT WHY IT'S HAPPENING.    
I THINK IT'S THE SAME REASON 
WHY WHEN I GO HOME TO ILLINOIS 
AFTER BEING IN THIS PUBLIC 
SERVICE JOB  FOR OVER 30 YEARS, 
I HEAR A QUESTION THAT I'VE 
NEVER EVER HEARD BEFORE 
REPEATEDLY AS PEOPLE PULL ME 
OFF TO THE SIDE AND SAY, 
SENATOR,  ARE WE GOING TO BE 
ALL RIGHT? 
ISAMERICA GOING TO BE ALL 
RIGHT?    
THEY'RE GENUINELY CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS 
COUNTRY 
YOU COME TO THISMOMENT IN 
HISTORY IN A RARE SITUATION. 
YOU ARE ASPIRING TOTHE MOST 
DECISIVE VOTE ON THE SUPREME 
COURT ON CRITICAL ISSUES, 
JUSTICE KENNEDY DID THAT FOR 12 
YEARS. 
AND YOU'RE CALLEDTO THAT 
RESPONSIBILITY.     
AND WE REALIZE THE GRAVITY OF 
THAT HAVE OPPORTUNITY AND THAT 
RESPONSIBILITY.      
SECONDLY, OF COURSE, YOUR 
RECORD AND THE STATEMENTS OF 
OTHERS  SUGGESTS THERE'S REAL 
GENUINE CONCERN ABOUT CHANGING 
LIFE AND DEATH  VALUES IN THIS 
COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU SEE THINGS 
DIFFERENTLY.      
WE'VE HEARD THAT OVER AND OVER 
AGAIN. 
AND I -- I THINKYOU MUST 
UNDERSTAND  THE DEPTH OF 
FEELING ABOUT THAT . 
AND THIRD, TRY ASTHEY MIGHT I'M 
AFRAID THE MAJORITY JUST CAN'T 
GET BEYOND THE FACT THAT THERE 
ARE PARTS OF YOUR PUBLIC LIFE 
THAT THEY WANT TO CONCEAL. 
THEY DON'T WANTAMERICA TO SEE 
THEM. 
I THINKTHAT'S A SERIOUS MISTAKE 
AND MAKE A SUGGESTION AT THE 
END OF MY REMARKS, BUT OVER AND 
ABOVE ALL OF THOSE THINGS IS 
THIS: YOU ARE THE NOMINEE  OF 
PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP, 
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO'S SHOWN 
US CONSISTENTLY -- HE HAS SAID 
AND DONE THINGS AS PRESIDENT  
WHICH WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE 
IN OUR HISTORY.     
HE IS DISMISSED THE HEAD OF THE 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
WHEN HE WOULDN'T BEND TO HIS 
WILL HE THREATENS AND HARASSES 
HIS OWN ATTORNEY GENERALLY 
ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS, AND I 
DIDN'T VOTE FOR JEFF SESSIONS 
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THERE 
SHOULD BE SOME RESPECT AT LEAST 
FOR THE OFFICE HE SERVED IN. 
AND IT'S THATPRESIDENT THAT'S 
DECIDED YOU ARE HIS MAN, YOU'RE 
THE PERSON HE WANTS ON THE 
SUPREME COURT, YOU ARE HIS 
PERSONAL CHOICE. 
SO AREPEOPLE NERVOUS ABOUT 
THIS? 
ARETHEY CONCERNED ABOUT IT? 
OFCOURSE THEY ARE. 
I'M SURE THEREWILL BE A SHOWER 
OF TWEETS SOME TIME LATER IN 
THE DAY HARASSING PEOPLE IN THE 
CABINET, PEOPLE IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE, MAYBE EVEN DISMISSING 
THEM, AND MAYBE EVEN GO AFTER 
ME AGAIN. 
BE MY GUEST.
BUT THE POINT I'M GETTING TO IS 
IF YOU WONDER WHY THIS REACTION 
IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE OF 
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS 
COUNTRY,    THERE ARE MANY OF 
US CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE 
OF THIS COUNTRY.    
AND THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY.    
AND YOU ARE ASKING FOR A 
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE 
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND WHERE 
YOU WILL MAKE DECISIONS, THE 
DECIDING VOTE ON THINGS THAT 
WILL DECIDE THE COURSE OF 
HISTORY AND WHERE WE'RE HEADED. 
THE SENATE HAS ACONSTITUTIONAL 
RESPONSIBILITY TO EVALUATE YOUR 
NOMINATION. 
WE DOKNOW THAT BEFORE YOU 
BECAME A JUDGE YOU WERE  
 
AGENDA PIP JOKINGLY SAID ON ONE 
OF YOUR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES 
YOU'RE LIKE THE FOREST GUMP OF 
REPUBLICAN POLITICS, YOU ALWAYS 
SHOW UP IN THE PICTURE.     
YOU'VE BEEN THERE.    
WE ALSO KNOW THAT BEFORE NAMING 
YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE IT 
CLEAR  THAT HE WOULD APPOINT 
JUSTICES ONLY APPOINT JUSTICES 
TO THE SUPREME COURT WHO WOULD 
OVERTURN ROE VERSUS WADE AND 
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 
THOSE WERE HIS TESTS.
NOW, HE DIDN'T ASK THE 
QUESTION, WHAT HE DID WAS TO 
DELEGATE THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO 
2 SPECIAL INTERESTS GROUPS, THE 
FEDERALIST SOCIETY AND THE 
HERITAGE FOUNDATION.    
AND THE OTHER GROUPS THAT ARE 
SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN 
SUPPORT OF YOUR CANDIDACY. 
THEY'RECONFIDENT THAT YOU'RE 
GOING TO FAVORITE CORPORATIONS 
OVERWORKERS AND GIVE THE 
PRESIDENT WIDE BERTH. 
YOUR OWNLAW CLERKS MEN AND 
WOMEN YOU CHOOSE THAT WROTE THE 
WORDS THAT HAD YOUR SIGNATURE 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE HAVE 
TOLD US WHAT THEY THINK OF YOU. 
ONE WROTE INAN ARTICLE ENTITLED 
QUOTE BRETT KAVANAUGH SAID 
OBAMA CARE WAS UNPRECEDENTED 
UNLAWFUL. 
THAT'SFROM ONE OF YOUR CLERKS. 
ANOTHER WROTE:  ENFORCING
RESTRICTIONS ON ABORTION NO 
COURT OF APPEALS JUDGE IN THE 
NATION HAS A STRONGER MORE 
CONSISTENT RECORD THAN JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH.     
BIG CORPORATE INTERESTS BEHIND 
YOUR NOMINATION, CHAMBER OF 
COMMERCE FULL SUPPORT AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHOSE LAWYERS 
SAY THEY'LL FIGHT ANY EFFORT TO 
SUBPOENA OR INDICT HIM ALL THE 
WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT THAT 
PRESIDENT SEEMS PERSONALLY 
EAGER TO HAVE YOU CONFIRMED AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.    
WHY ARE YOUR SUPPORTERS SO 
CONFIDENT YOU'LL RULE AS THEY 
WISH, WHY DO THEY THINK YOU'RE 
SUCH A SURE BET TO TAKE THEIR 
SIDE. 
ONE OFTHE WORDS ONE OF YOUR 
FORMER CLERKS THIS IS NO TIME 
FOR A GAMBLE. 
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'TTHINK 
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL US THAT 
MUCH THIS WEEK. 
IT'SINTERESTING TO ME THAT 
PEOPLE IN YOUR POSITION MAKE 
ALL THESE SPEECHESES AND CLAM 
UP, DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
ANY ISSUES, BUT THAT'S WHAT I 
EXPECT.      
INSTEAD WE'LL BE ASKED TO TRUST 
IF YOU'RE CONFIRMED YOU'LL HAVE 
AN OPEN MIND, FOLLOW THE LAW 
RATHER THAN MOVE THE LAW IN THE 
DIRECTION OF YOUR VIEWS. 
I'D LIKE TO TRUSTYOU.  
I WANTED TO TRUST YOU THE LAST 
TIME YOU TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS 
COMMITTEE IN 2006, BUT AFTER 
YOU WERE CONFIRMED TO THE D.C. 
CIRCUIT REPORTS SURFACED THAT 
CONTRADICTED YOUR SWORN 
TESTIMONY BEFORE THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
YOU SAID TO ME UNDER OATH THE 
FOLLOWING:     I WAS NOT 
INVOLVED AND AM NOT INVOLVED IN 
THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RULES 
GOVERNING DETENTION OF COMBAT 
TANS BUT LATER JUST A WEEK OR 
SO AGO YOU ACKNOWLEDGED TO MY 
OFFICE THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED. 
FOR 12 YEARS YOU COULD HAVE 
APOLOGIZED AND CORRECTED THIS 
RECORD BUT YOU NEVER INSTEAD. 
INSTEAD YOU AND YOUR SUPPORTERS 
ARGUED WE SHOULD IGNORE THE 
SIMPLE SENTENCE WHICH YOU SPOKE 
AND SOMEHOW CON CLUE YOUR WORDS 
MEAN SOMETHING FAR DIFFERENT.   
YOU SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE 
FOR YOUR OWN WORDS. 
AFTER MY PERSONALEXPERIENCE  I 
START THESE HEARINGS WITH 
QUESTION ABOUT YOUR CREDIBILITY 
AS A WITNESS, I NOTE FROM MY 
HISTORY WITH YOU THE THINGS YOU 
SAID NEED TO BE CAREFULLY 
VERIFIED. 
THAT BRINGSUS TO A MAINLY 
PROBLEM, I WON'T RETREAD THE 
GROUND ABOUT ALL THE DOCUMENTS 
THAT ARE BEING WITHHELD, I'LL 
SHOW YOU A LITTLE CALENDAR 
THAT'S INTERESTING. 
THERE'S A 35-MONTH BLACK HOLE 
IN YOUR WHITE HOUSE CAREER. 
WHEREWE'VE BEEN DENIED ACCESS 
TO ANY AND ALL DOCUMENTS, 35 
MONTHS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 
I ASKED IN MYOFFICE DURING THAT 
PERIOD OF TIME PRESIDENT BUSH 
WAS CONSIDERING SAME SEX 
MARRIAGE, AN AMENDMENT TO BAN 
IT, ABORTION, EXECUTIVE POWER, 
TORTURE, SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEES, WARRANTLESS 
WIRETAPPING, ONE OF THESE BEARS 
     
IN 2004, AND 20005, I JOINED 
JOHN McCAIN WHEN HE LED THE 
EFFORT TO PASS AN AMENDMENT 
AFFIRMING THAT TORTURE AND 
CRUEL AND DEGRADING TREATMENT 
WOULD BE ILLEGAL IN AMERICA AS 
A SURVIVOR OF UNSPEAKABLE 
TORTURE JOHN McCAIN SPOKE WITH 
POWERFUL AUTHORITY DURING THE 
TIME OF WAR. 
YOUWERE IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE 
WHEN THAT AMENDMENT PASSED. 
THEBUSH ADMINISTRATION DID 
EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO STOP 
JOHN McCAIN'S TORTURE 
AMENDMENT. 
THEN AFTER WE PASSED IT 
PRESIDENT BUSH ISSUED A SIGNING 
STATEMENT ASSERTING HIS RIGHT 
TO IGNORE THE LAW THAT JOHN 
McCAIN JUST PASSED IN CONGRESS. 
WHENWE MET YOU ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT YOU WORKED ON THAT SIGNING 
STATEMENT YET WE'VE BEEN DENIED 
ANY DOCUMENTS DISCLOSING YOUR 
ROLE OR ADVICE TO PRESIDENT 
BUSH. 
IASKED YOU IF YOU WROTE, EDITED 
OR APPROVED DOCUMENTS ABOUT 
THESE AND OTHER ISSUES, TIME 
AND AGAIN YOU SAID CAN'T RULE 
IT OUT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
AMERICA NEEDS TO SEE THOSE 
DOCUMENTS. 
WE CANNOT CAREFULLY REVIEW, 
ADVICE AND DECIDE WHETHER TO 
CONSENT TO YOUR NOMINATION 
WITHOUT CLARITY ON THE RECORD. 
THE PERIOD OF TIME WHEN YOU 
WORKED IN THE REPUBLICAN WHITE 
HOUSE  LED TO A CHANGE IN 
POSITION ON AN ISSUE WHICH WE 
HAVE TO ADDRESS  DIRECTLY.    
YOUR VIEWS ON EXECUTIVE POWER 
AND ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE CHANGED 
DRAMATICALLY. 
WHEN YOU WORKEDFOR SPECIAL 
COUNSEL KEN STAR IN THE LATE 
1990s, YOU CALLED HIM QUOTE AN 
AMERICAN HERO FOR INVESTIGATING 
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON, AND YOU 
PERSONALLY URGED HIM TO BE 
AGGRESSIVE CONFRONTATIONAL AND 
EVEN GRAPHIC IN HIS QUESTIONS.  
WE'VE SEEN YOUR MEMO ON THAT 
ONE. 
A FEW YEARS LATER AFTERWORKING 
IN THE REPUBLICAN WHITE HOUSE 
YOU TOTALLY REVERSED YOUR 
POSITION AND ARGUED THE 
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE ABOVE THE 
LAW.      
. 
>> AT THIS MOVEMENT IN OUR 
NATION'S HISTORY WITH FORCES 
THREATENING OUR DEMOCRACY WITH 
THE CAMPAIGN AND ADMINISTRATION 
OF THIS PRESIDENT UNDER FEDERAL 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, WE NEED 
A DIRECT CREDIBLE ANSWER FROM 
YOU.     
IS THIS PRESIDENT OR ANY 
PRESIDENT ABOVE THE LAW?      
EQUALLY IMPORTANT CAN THIS 
PRESIDENT IGNORE THE 
CONSTITUTION IN THE EXERCISE OF 
HIS AUTHORITY.      
WHEN THE PRESIDENT DEEMED THE 
STATUTE UNCONSTITUTIONAL EVEN 
WHEN THE COURT WOULD HOLD THE 
STATUE OR CONSTITUTION. 
THIS FLIES IN THE FACE OF OUR 
SEPARATION OF POWERS. 
IS LICENSED TO THIS PRESIDENT, 
DONALD TRUMP, OR ANY PRESIDENT 
WHO CHOOSES TO IGNORE THE 
CONSTITUTION, TO ASSERT 
AUTHORITY FAR BEYOND THAT 
ENVISIONED BY OUR FOUNDING -- 
FOUNDING FATHERS. 
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE 
WATCHING CAREFULLY. 
I MIGHT MAKE A SUGGESTION TO 
YOU TODAY. 
IF YOU BELIEVE YOUR PUBLIC 
RECORD IS ONE YOU CAN STAND 
BEHIND AND DEFEND, I HOPE AT 
THE END OF THIS YOU WILL ASK 
THIS COMMITTEE TO SUSPEND UNTIL 
WE ARE GIVEN ALL THE DOCUMENTS, 
UNTIL WE HAVE THE TIME TO 
REVIEW THEM. AND THEN WE RESUME 
THIS HEARING. 
WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS 
BASICALLY THIS, IF YOU WILL 
TRUST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY 
WILL TRUST YOU. 
BUT IF YOU'RE EFFORT TODAY 
CONTINUES TO CONCEAL AND HIGH 
DOCUMENTS, IT RAISES A SUSPICION
. I WILL CLOSE MR. CHAIRMAN. 
I KNOW YOU ARE ANXIOUS. 
WHEN I WAS A PRACTICING LAWYER, 
A LONG TIME AGO IN TRIALS, AND 
THE OTHER SIDE EITHER DESTROYED 
OR CONCEALED EVIDENCE, I KNEW 
THAT I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
HAVE A CONVINCING ARGUMENT TO 
CLOSE THAT CASE. 
WHAT WERE THEY HIDING? 
WHY WON'T THEY LET YOU SEE THE 
TAPE ON THAT TRAIN OR THE 
DOCUMENTS THEY CAN'T FIND? 
YOU KNOW THE PRESUMPTION NOW IS 
AGAINST YOU BECAUSE OF ALL THE 
DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN HELD 
BACK. 
FOR THE SAKE OF THIS NATION, 
FOR THE SANCTITY OF THE 
CONSTITUTION WE BOTH HONOR, 
STEP UP, ASK THIS GATHERING TO 
SUSPEND UNTIL ALL THE DOCUMENTS 
OF YOUR PUBLIC CAREER ARE THERE 
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SEE. 
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> SENATOR LEAHY. 
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  
I AM GOING TO START BY SAYING 
THAT, THE FACT THAT THERE IS SO 
MUCH ANGST OVER A SINGLE NOMINEE
, A SINGLE JUDICIAL NOMINEE 
TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED 
TO KNOW ABOUT WHY IT IS THAT WE 
NEED JUDGES ARE NOW MORE THAN 
EVER WHO ARE WILLING TO READ 
THE LAW AND INTERPRET BASED ON 
WHAT THE LAW SAYS RATHER THAN 
ON THE BASIS OF SOMETHING ELSE. 
IT ALSO TELLS YOU MORE THAN 
ANYTHING ELSE YOU COULD NEED TO 
KNOW ABOUT THE NEED TO RESTORE 
A DISCUSSION OF CIVICS IN THIS 
COUNTRY. 
TO RESTORE A DISCUSSION ABOUT 
FEDERALISM AND SEPARATION OF 
POWERS. 
ABOUT WHERE POWER IS 
CONCENTRATED AND WHERE IT 
SHOULD NOT BE AND WHAT THE RULE 
OF EACH BRANCH OF THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT IS AND IS NOT. 
MANY OF THE COMMENTS, MANY 
OUTBURSTS WE HAVE HAD TODAY 
SUGGEST WE NEED TO RETURN TO 
SOME OF THOSE FUNDAMENTAL 
PRINCIPLES. 
I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU ARE A 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT OR 
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN OR 
SOMETHING IN BETWEEN, THESE 
PRINCIPLES APPLY. 
THEY ARE PRINCIPLES TO WHICH WE 
HAVE SWORN AN OATH AND THEY ARE 
PRINCIPLES WE WOULD DO WELL TO 
RESTORE AND FOCUS ON ONCE 
AGAIN. 
IF EVER WE WERE TO RETURN TO AN 
ERROR OF FOR SO -- -- WE WILL 
RETURN -- CIVILITY, WE WOULD 
RETURN ON THE BASIS -- A NUMBER 
OF MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE 
WILL ASK YOU QUESTIONS, 
QUESTIONS ABOUT CASES THAT YOU 
HAVE HANDLED AS A LAWYER, CASES 
THAT YOU HAVE DECIDED AS A 
JUDGE, ABOUT YOUR RECORD, ABOUT 
YOUR QUALIFICATIONS. 
ON THAT POINT ABOUT YOUR RECORD 
AND QUALIFICATIONS, THE 
SUGGESTION THAT YOU MISLED THIS 
COMMITTEE AT ANY POINT IN YOUR 
PREVIOUS HEARINGS IS ABSURD. 
AND THE ABSURDITY OF THAT 
SUGGESTION WILL BE BORN OUT IN 
THE COMING DAYS. 
I AM CERTAIN OF THAT. 
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WILL 
BE ASKED OF YOU WILL IN FACT BE 
FAIR AND OTHERS WILL BE UNFAIR, 
AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR 
US TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AT THE 
OUTSET. 
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK IN HISTORY, 
ANSWERING THESE KINDS OF 
QUESTIONS, THIS IS SORT OF HOW 
THEY -- THE PRACTICE OF HOLDING 
THE SERIES BEGAN, SO SENATORS 
COULD ASK NOMINEES HOW THEY 
MIGHT GO, HOW THEY MIGHT RULE 
IN PARTICULAR CASES. 
BUT THIS DID NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN. 
IN FACT, IT WASN'T UNTIL 1916 
THAT THIS EVEN STARTED. 
YOU SEE, THERE HAVE BEEN 113 
JUSTICES CONFIRMED TO THE 
SUPREME COURT SO FAR. 
THE FIRST 66 WERE CONFIRMED 
WITHOUT EVEN HOLDING A HEARING. 
THE IDEA OF A HEARING IS 
RELATIVELY NEW, ABOUT 102 YEARS 
OLD. 
WE WENT FOR BETWEEN 125 AND 130 
YEARS UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
REPUBLIC WITHOUT EVER HAVING A 
HEARING. 
REGARDLESS, WE STARTED HAVING 
HEARINGS JUST OVER A CENTURY 
AGO. 
THE VERY FIRST SUPREME COURT 
CONFIRMATION HEARING OCCURRED 
IN 1916 WITH JUSTICE LOUIS 
BRANDEIS. 
AFTER HE WAS NOMINATED TO THE 
COURT, CALLED FOR A HEARING. IF 
WE ARE HONEST WITH OURSELVES, 
IF WE ARE HONEST ABOUT HISTORY, 
I THINK A LOT OF US MAYBE HAD 
TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT HE 
WAS JEWISH. BUT SENATORS ALSO 
WANTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE 
WOULD USE HIS SEAT ON THE 
SUPREME COURT TO ADVOCATE FOR 
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE HAD 
ADVOCATED FOR AS A PRIVATE 
CITIZEN. 
AS A PUBLIC INTEREST ATTORNEY. 
THEY WANTED TO KNOW HOW HE 
MIGHT VOTE IN PARTICULAR CASES. 
THEY DID NOT ASK JUSTICE 
BRANDEIS TO TESTIFY 
SIGNIFICANTLY. 
BUT THEY DID IN FACT ASK SOME 
OUTSIDE WITNESSES WHAT THEY 
THOUGHT ABOUT HIS NOMINATION. 
THE NEXT IMPORTANT MOMENT ONE 
COULD ARGUE OCCURRED IN 1939 
WHEN FELIX FRANKFURTER BECAME 
THE FIRST NOMINEE TO HIMSELF 
TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. 
AT THE TIME, HE WAS 
CONTROVERSIAL IN PART BECAUSE 
HE WAS BORN OVERSEAS, BUT 
SENATORS ALSO WORRIED THAT HE 
WAS A RADICAL BASED ON HIS 
DEFENSE OF ANARCHISTS IN COURT. 
SO AGAIN, SENATORS WANTED 
ASSURANCES ABOUT HOW HE MIGHT 
RULE IN PARTICULAR CASES AND 
WHAT RESULTS HE MIGHT REACH IN 
A PARTICULAR TYPE OF CASE. 
HE, HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANTLY 
DECLINED TO ENGAGE WITH 
SENATORS ON THOSE TOPICS, AND 
INSISTED HIS PUBLIC RECORD 
SPOKE FOR ITSELF. 
THE NOMINATION OF JUSTICE 
STEWART IN 1959 WITH ANOTHER 
TURNING POINT. 
SENATORS SEEKING TO RESIST 
BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION,
THEY WANTED TO GRILL HIM ON HIS 
VIEWS ON INTEGRATION. 
OTHERS WANTED TO GRILL HIM 
ABOUT HIS VIEWS ON NATIONAL 
SECURITY. 
SO SENATORS TURNED UP THE HEAT 
A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THAT 
HEARING. LIKE FRANKFURTER 
BEFORE HIM, JUSTICE STEWART DID 
NOT PROVIDE SUBSTANTIVE ANSWERS 
TO THEIR QUESTIONS. WHEN THEY 
WANTED TO KNOW HOW YOU MIGHT 
RULE IN PARTICULAR CASES, HE 
APPROPRIATELY DECLINED. 
JUST AS HIS PREDECESSORS HAD. 
28 YEARS LATER, AFTER JUSTICE 
STEWART CAME THROUGH THIS 
COMMITTEE, THE SENATE CONSIDERED
ROBERT BORK. 
THIS WAS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT 
TURNING POINT. IN MY VIEW IT 
REMAINS SOMETHING OF A ROCK-
BOTTOM MOMENT FOR THE SENATE 
AND FOR THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE. 
WITHOUT GETTING INTO ANY OF THE 
GORY DETAILS HERE, I THINK IT 
IS SUFFICE TO SAY THAT SENATOR 
TED KENNEDY AND JUDGE BORK DID 
NOT AGREE ON CERTAIN MATTERS OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. 
AND THE RESPONSE BY KENNEDY WAS 
TO SAVAGE, UNFAIRLY IN MY 
OPINION, THE RESULTS THAT JUDGE 
BORK WOULD REACH IF CONFIRMED 
TO THE SUPREME COURT. 
HISTORY SHOWS THAT OVER THE 
BETTER PART OF A CENTURY THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS 
GRADUALLY CREATED SOMETHING OF 
A NEW NORM, A NORM IN WHICH 
MEMBERS DEMANDED NOMINEES SPEAK 
ABOUT SPECIFIC CASES.
NOMINEES FOR THE MOST PART HAVE 
GRACEFULLY RESISTED TRADING 
CONFIRMATION IN EXCHANGE FOR 
PROMISES ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT 
VOTE IN PARTICULAR CASES 
BROUGHT BEFORE THEM. 
TO GIVE TWO FAMOUS EXAMPLES, 
JUSTICE SCALIA REFUSED TO SAY 
WHETHER MARBURY VERSUS MADISON 
WAS SETTLED LAW ON THE GROUND 
THAT IT COULD COME BEFORE HIM, 
AND SURE ENOUGH LAST TERM IN 
ORTIZ VERSUS UNITED STATES, THE 
SUPREME COURT CONSIDERED A CASE 
INDICATING THE SCOPE OF THAT. 
LIKEWISE, JUSTICE RUTH BADER 
GINSBURG MADE THE SOWS CALLED 
GINSBERG STANDARD. 
NO PREVIOUS, NO FORECAST, NO 
HINT. 
EVERY CURRENT MEMBER OF THE 
SUPREME COURT HAS ADHERED TO A 
SIMILAR PRINCIPLE. 
WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE GINSBERG 
STANDARD. 
EVEN THOUGH NOMINEES HAVE NOT 
CAVED TO THE PRESSURE, I STILL 
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME 
ASPECTS OF THE SENATE APPROACH 
HERE THAT MIGHT DO A DISSERVICE 
TO THE COUNTRY AND MIGHT BE 
FROWNED UPON BY FUTURE 
HISTORIANS. 
IF SENATORS REPEATEDLY ASK 
NOMINEES ABOUT OUTCOMES, THEN 
THE PUBLIC WILL BE MORE 
ENTITLED OR AT LEAST MORE 
INCLINED TO THINK THAT JUDGES 
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE OUTCOME 
MIGHT'VE. 
THAT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE 
THEIR WHOLE APPROACH TO 
JUDGING. 
THAT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE 
WHAT JUDGING IS ABOUT. 
BUT THIS, OF COURSE, UNDERMINES 
THE LEGITIMACY OF THE COURTS 
THEMSELVES. 
THE VERY LEGITIMACY OF THE 
TRIBUNAL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN 
NOMINATED BY THE PRESIDENT TO 
SERVE ON. 
OVERTIME, NO FREE PEOPLE WOULD 
ACCEPT A JUDICIARY THAT SIMPLY 
IMPOSES ITS OWN POLICY 
PREFERENCES ON THE COUNTRY 
ABSENT FIDELITY TO LEGAL 
PRINCIPLE. 
THERE IS A BETTER WAY FOR THE 
SENATE TO APPROACH ITS WORK. 
THIS PROCESS, IN MY OPINION, 
SHOULD BE ABOUT YOUR 
QUALIFICATIONS, ABOUT YOUR 
CHARACTER, AND PERHAPS MOST 
IMPORTANTLY, ABOUT YOUR 
APPROACH TO JUDGING, YOUR OWN 
VIEW ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE 
FEDERAL JUDICIARY. 
IT SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT RESULTS 
IN A SELECT NUMBER OF CASES. 
YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY EXCEPTIONALLY 
WELL-QUALIFIED, EVEN YOUR 
STAUNCHEST CRITICS WOULD NOT 
CLAIM OTHERWISE. 
YOUR ACADEMIC PEDIGREE, YOUR 
EXPERIENCE AS A PRACTICING 
LAWYER, YOUR EXPERIENCE IN 
GOVERNMENT AND YOUR 12 YEARS 
EXPERIENCE SITTING ON WHAT MANY 
REFER TO AS THE SECOND HIGHEST 
COURT IN THE LAND, U.S. COURT 
OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT.
YOU WERE INDEPENDENT. 
YOU HAVE WRITTEN THAT "SOME OF 
THE GREATEST MOMENTS IN 
AMERICAN JUDICIAL HISTORY HAVE 
BEEN WHEN JUDGES STOOD UP TO 
THE OTHER BRANCHES. WE ARE NOT 
COWED AND ENFORCED THE LAW." 
YOU HAVE SAID THAT JUDGES 
CANNOT BE BUFFALOED INFLUENCED 
OR PRESSURED INTO WORRIED -- 
WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT 
TRANSIENT POPULARITY WHEN WE 
ARE TRYING TO DECIDE A CASE AND 
THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
DUTIES OF A JUDGE IS TO STAND 
UP FOR THE UNPOPULAR PARTY WHO 
HAS THE CORRECT POSITION. 
AND YOU HAVE LIVED UP TO YOUR 
WORDS DURING YOUR TIME ON THE 
BENCH. 
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT YOU SERVED 
IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. 
AND YET, WHEN YOU BECAME A JUDGE
, IN ONLY TWO YEARS YOU RULED 
AGAINST THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION 
A TOTAL OF EIGHT TIMES. FOR YOU 
IT SIMPLY DOESN'T MATTER WHO 
THE PARTIES ARE. 
IT SIMPLY DOESN'T MATTER THAT 
YOU MAY HAVE WORKED FOR AN 
ADMINISTRATION BEFORE YOU 
BECAME A JUDGE. 
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS 
YOUR COMMITMENT TO CORRECTLY 
APPLYING THE LAW TO THE FACTS 
OF ANY PARTICULAR CASE. 
AS FAR AS YOUR APPROACH TO 
JUDGING, YOU HAVE APPROPRIATE 
RESPECT FOR PRECEDENT. 
YOU HAVE CO-AUTHORED AN 800 
PAGE BOOK ON PRECEDENT THAT 
AMONG OTHER THINGS EXPLAINS 
THAT A CHANGE IN A COURT 
MEMBERSHIP ALONE SHOULD NOT 
THROW FORMER DECISIONS OPEN TO 
RECONSIDERATION OR JUSTIFY 
THEIR REVERSAL. 
YOU'VE EXPLAINED THAT FOR 
PRECEDENT TO BE OVERRULED, IT 
MUST NOT BE JUST WRONG, BUT A 
CASE WITH SERIOUS PRACTICAL 
CONSEQUENCES. 
YOU VOTED TO OVERTURN CIRCUIT 
PRECEDENT ONLY FOUR TIMES 
DURING YOUR TIME ON THE D.C. 
CIRCUIT AND EACH OF THESE CASES 
INVOLVED A UNANIMOUS DECISION 
REACHED BY YOUR COLLEAGUES. 
YOU FOLLOWED PRECEDENT EVEN 
THOUGH YOU BELIEVED IT WAS 
ITSELF WRONGLY DECIDED. 
YOU DECIDE CASES BASED ON LEGAL 
MERITS, NOT BASED ON THE 
IDENTITY OF THE PARTIES. 
AND CERTAINLY NOT BASED ON ANY 
POLITICAL BELIEFS THAT YOU MAY 
HARBOR. WE'VE ALREADY HEARD 
THAT YOUR NOMINATION WILL 
SOMEHOW BE BAD. 
I HAVE A LAUNDRY LIST OF CASES 
IN WHICH YOU HAVE RULED FOR 
PEOPLE IN EACH OF THOSE GROUPS, 
BUT THERE IS A MORE FUNDAMENTAL 
POINT HERE THAT I THINK NEEDS 
TO BE MADE. 
THE JUDICIARY DECISIONS ARE 
LEGITIMATE. ONLY TO THE EXTENT 
THAT THEY ARE BASED ON SOUND 
LEGAL PRINCIPLE AND REASONING. 
AND RULING FOR A PREFERRED 
PARTY IS NOT ITSELF A SOUND 
LEGAL RENTABLE. 
IT IS QUITE CONTRARY. 
-- PRINCIPAL. 
IT IS QUITE CONTRARY. 
BACKFILLING REASONING TO REACH 
A PARTICULAR RESULT, A 
POLITICALLY ACCEPTABLE RESULT, 
IN A PARTICULAR CASE, NO MATTER 
HOW DESIRABLE THAT RESULT MIGHT 
BE IS NOT A LEGITIMATE IT -- 
LEGITIMATE MODE OF JUDICIAL 
DECISION-MAKING AND NO FREE 
PEOPLE PURPORTING TO HAVE AN 
INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY SHOULD 
EVER BE WILLING TO SETTLE FOR 
THAT. 
SO MY PLEA TO MY COLLEAGUES 
TODAY IS THAT WE ASK KAVANAUGH  
-- JUDGE KAVANAUGH HARD 
QUESTIONS. 
I BELIEVE WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO 
SO. 
THE SENATE IS NOT AND NEVER 
SHOULD BE A RUBBERSTAMP, 
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO 
ISSUING LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS.  
EVEN LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS ON 
THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. 
BUT IF YOU DISAGREE WITH AN 
OPINION HE HAS WRITTEN, MAKE A 
LEGAL ARGUMENT AS TO THAT ISSUE.
EXPLAIN WHY YOU THINK IT IS 
WRONG. DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE 
RESULTS. 
AS IF THE RESULT ITSELF IS 
PROOF THAT HE IS WRONG WHEN YOU 
SEPARATE OUT THE RESULT FROM 
THE LEGAL ANALYSIS. 
FROM THE FACTS AND HOW THEY 
INTERACT WITH THE LAW IN THAT 
PARTICULAR CASE. 
AND DON'T ASK HIM TO MAKE 
PROMISES ABOUT OUTCOMES IN 
PARTICULAR CASES. 
IF IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE 
PRESIDENT TO IMPOSE A LITMUS 
TEST, IT IS SURELY UNACCEPTABLE 
FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO 
DO SO. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I LOOK FORWARD 
TO YOUR TESTIMONY, AND I'M 
GRATEFUL TO YOU AND YOUR 
WILLINGNESS TO SERVE HER 
COUNTRY AND BE CONSIDERED FOR 
THIS IMPORTANT ROLE. 
>> SENATOR WHITEHOUSE. 
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
WHEN IS PATTERN EVIDENCE OF 
BIAS? 
IN COURT, PATTERN IS EVIDENCE 
OF BIAS ALL THE TIME. 
EVIDENCE ON WHICH JURIES AND 
TRIAL JUDGES RELY TO SHOW 
DISCRIMINATORY INTENT, TO SHOW 
A COMMON SCHEME, TO SHOW BIAS. 
WHEN DOES A PATTERN PROVE BIAS? 
I WISH THIS WERE AN IDLE 
QUESTION? 
IT IS RELEVANT TO THE PATTERN 
OF THE ROBERTS COURT WHEN ITS 
REPUBLICAN MAJORITY GOES OFF ON 
PARTISAN EXCURSIONS THROUGH THE 
CIVIL LAW. 
THAT IS, WHEN ALL FIVE 
REPUBLICAN APPOINTEES, THE 
ROBERTS FIVE WE CAN CALL THEM, 
GO OFF TOGETHER AND NO 
DEMOCRATIC APPOINTEE JOINS THEM.
DOES THIS HAPPEN OFTEN? 
THE ROBERTS FIVE HAS GONE ON 
ALMOST 80 OF THESE PARTISAN 
EXCURSIONS SINCE ROBERTS BECAME 
CHIEF. THAT IS A LOT OF TIMES. 
AND THERE IS A FEATURE TO THESE 
80 CASES. 
THEY ALMOST ALL IMPLICATE 
INTERESTS IMPORTANT TO THE BIG 
FUNDERS AND INFLUENCERS OF THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
WHEN THE REPUBLICAN JUSTICES GO 
OFF ON THESE FIVE JUSTICE 
PARTISAN EXCURSIONS, THERE IS A 
BIG REPUBLICAN CORPORATE OR 
PARTISAN INTEREST INVOLVED 92% 
OF THE TIME. 
THE TINY HANDFUL OF THESE CASES 
THAT DON'T IMPLICATE AN 
INTEREST OF THE PAPER PUBLIC 
AND INFLUENCERS IS SO FEW THAT 
WE CAN SET THEM ASIDE. 
LET'S LOOK AT THE 73 CASES THAT 
ALL IMPLICATE A MAJOR 
REPUBLICAN PARTY INTEREST. 
AGAIN, 73 IS A LOT OF CASES AT 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
IS THERE A PATTERN TO THESE 73 
CASES? 
YES THERE IS. 
EVERY TIME A BIG REPUBLICAN 
CORPORATE OR PARTISAN INTEREST 
IS INVOLVED, THE BIG REPUBLICAN 
INTEREST WINDS. 
EVERY TIME. 
-- WILL WIN. 
EVERY TIME. 
THE BIG REPUBLICAN INTEREST 
WILL WIN EVERY TIME. 
THUS, THE MAD SCRAMBLE OF BIG 
REPUBLICAN INTEREST GROUPS TO 
PROTECT A ROBERTS FIVE THAT 
WILL RELIABLY GIVE THEM THE WIN.
REALLY BIG ONE SOMETIMES. 
I NOTE THAT WHEN THE ROBERTS 
FIVE SADDLES UP, THESE SO-
CALLED CONSERVATIVES ARE 
ANYTHING BUT JUDICIALLY 
CONSERVATIVE. 
THEY READILY OVERTURN 
PRECEDENT, TOSS OUT STATUTES 
PASSED BY WIDE BIPARTISAN 
MARGINS,  AND DECIDE ON BROAD 
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THAT THEY 
NEED NOT REACH. 
MODESTY, ORIGINAL IS HIM, -- 
ORIGINALITY, ALL THESE 
SUPPOSEDLY CONSERVATIVE 
JUDICIAL PRINCIPLES ALL HAVE 
THE PRINCE OF THE ROBERTS FIVE 
ALL ACROSS THEIR BACKS WERE -- 
THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE ROBERTS 
FIVE ALL OVER THEIR BACKS. 
THE LITANY OF ROBERTS FIVE 
DECISIONS EXPLAINS WHY BIG 
REPUBLICAN INTERESTS WANT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH ON THE COURT SO 
BADLY.  
SO BADLY THAT REPUBLICANS 
TRAMPLED SO MUCH SENATE 
PRECEDENT TO PUSH HIM THROUGH.  
SO LET'S REVIEW THE HIGHLIGHTS 
REAL. WHAT DO BIG REPUBLICAN 
INTERESTS WANT? 
FIRST THEY WANT TO WIN 
ELECTIONS. 
WHAT HAS THE ROBERTS FIVE 
DELIVERED? 
HELP FOR REPUBLICANS TO 
GERRYMANDER ELECTIONS. 
HELP REPUBLICANS KEEP MINORITY 
VOTERS AWAY FROM THE POLLS. 
SHELBY COUNTY 5-4 AND ABBOTT V 
PEREZ 5-4 DESPITE THE TRIAL 
JUDGE FINDING THE TEXAS 
LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY INTENDED 
TO TARGET AND SUPPRESS MINORITY 
VOTERS. 
AND THE BIG ONE, HELP CORPORATE 
FRONT GROUP MONEY FLOOD 
ELECTIONS. 
BIG MONEY INTERESTS LOVE 
UNLIMITED POWER TO BUY ELECTIONS
, LOBBY AND THREATEN AND BULLY 
McCUTCHEON 5-4, AND THE 
INFAMOUS GROTESQUE 5-4 CITIZENS 
UNITED DECISION WHICH I BELIEVE 
STANDS BESIDE LOCHNER ON THE 
ROLE OF SHANE. 
WHAT ELSE DO BIG INFLUENCERS 
WANT? 
TO GET OUT OF COURTROOMS. 
BIG INFLUENCERS HATE COURTROOMS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE LOBBYING AND 
THEIR ELECTIONEERING AND 
THREATENING DOESN'T WORK. 
OR AT LEAST IT IS NOT SUPPOSED 
TO BACK IN A COURTROOM, BIG 
INFLUENCERS ARE USED TO GETTING 
THEIR WAY AND HAVE TO SUFFER 
THE INDIGNITY OF EQUAL 
TREATMENT. 
SO THE ROBERTS FIVE PROTECTS 
CORPORATIONS FROM GROUP CLASS-
ACTION LAWSUITS, COMCAST 5-4 
AND THIS PAST TERM EPIC SYSTEMS 
5-4. THE ROBERTS FIVE HELPS 
CORPORATIONS STEER CUSTOMERS 
AND WORKERS AWAY FROM 
COURTROOMS AND INTO MANDATORY 
ARBITRATION, ITALIAN COLORS AND 
RENT-A-CENTER, ROBERTS FIVE. 
EPIC SYSTEMS DOES DOUBLE DUTY 
BECAUSE NOW WORKERS CAN'T EVEN 
ARBITRATE THEIR CLAIMS AS A 
GROUP. 
INJURY ACCESS TO THE COURTHOUSE 
FOR PLAINTIFFS GENERALLY. 
PROTECTING CORPORATIONS FOR 
BEING TAKEN TO COURT BY 
EMPLOYEES HARMED THROUGH PAIN 
DISCRIMINATION, LEDBETTER 5-4. 
AGE DISCRIMINATION, GROSS, 5-4. 
HARASSMENT, ADVANCE, 5-4. IN 
RETALIATION, NASSER, 5-4. EVEN 
INSULATED CORPORATIONS FROM 
LIABILITY FROM INTERNATIONAL 
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, JUST 
NERVE 5-4. CORPORATIONS ARE NOT 
IN THE CONSTITUTION. 
JURIES ARE. 
INDEED, COURTROOM JURIES ARE 
THE ONE ELEMENT OF AMERICAN 
GOVERNMENT DESIGNED TO PROTECT 
PEOPLE AGAINST ENCROACHMENTS BY 
PRIVATE WEALTH AND POWER. SO, 
OF COURSE, THE ROBERTS FIVE 
RULES FOR WEALTHY POWERFUL 
CORPORATIONS OVER JURY RIGHTS 
EVERY TIME WITH OUT A MENTION 
OF THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT. 
WHAT IS ANOTHER ONE? 
A CLASSIC. 
HELPING BIG BUSINESS BUST 
UNIONS. 
HARRIS ME QUINN 5-4 -- HARRISON 
VERSUS QUINN 5-4. LOTS OF BIG 
REPUBLICAN INFLUENCERS ARE 
POLLUTERS WHO LIKE TO POLLUTE 
FOR FREE.
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
HOMEBUILDERS WEAKENING 
PROTECTIONS FOR ENDANGERED 
SPECIES, 5-4. MICHIGAN VERSUS 
EPA HELPING AIR POLLUTERS, 5-4. 
AND IN THE FACE OF EMERGING 
CLIMATE HAVE A, THERE IS THE 
PROCEDURALLY ABHORRENT 5-4 
DECISION TO STOP THE EPA CLEAN 
POWER PLAN. 
A PATTERN. 
THEN COME ROBERTS FIVE BONUS 
DECISIONS WITH THE SOCIAL 
AGENDA, UPHOLDING RESTRICTIVE 
ABORTION LAWS, HOBBY LOBBY 
GRANTING RELIGIOUS RATES OVER 
HEALTHCARE RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES. 
LETTING STATES TONIGHT WOMEN 
MAKING TRUTHFUL INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES. 
ALL REPUBLICAN. 
HELLER AND McDONALD WHICH 
REANIMATED A THREE A FORMER 
CHIEF JUSTICE RUNS CALLED A 
FRAUD. 
BOTH DECISIONS 5-4. THIS YEAR, 
TRUCK VERSUS HAWAII, 5-4. 
RUBBERSTAMPING THE MUSLIM 
TRAVEL BAN. 
-- TRUMP VERSUS HAWAII, 5-4. 
RUBBERSTAMPING THE TRAVEL -- 
THE MUSLIM TRAVEL BAN. 
A PATTERN. 
NO WONDER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
FEEL THE GAME IS RIGGED. 
HERE IS HOW THE GAME WORKS. 
BIG BUSINESS AND PARTISAN 
GROUPS FUND THE FEDERALIST 
SOCIETY WHICH PICKED NEIL 
GORSUCH AND NOW YOU. 
AS THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL 
ADMITTED, THEY IN SOURCE TO THE 
FEDERALIST SOCIETY FOR THE 
SELECTION. 
EXACTLY HOW THE NOMINEES WERE 
PICKED AND WHO WAS IN THE ROOM, 
WHERE IT HAPPENED AND WHO HAD A 
VOTE OR VETO AND WHAT WAS SAID 
OR PROMISED, THAT IS ALL A 
DEEP, DARK SECRET. 
THAT BIG BUSINESS AND PARTISAN 
GROUPS FUND THE JUDICIAL CRISIS 
NETWORK WHICH RUNS DARK MANY 
POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS TO 
INFLUENCE SENATORS IN 
CONFIRMATION VOTES, AS THEY 
HAVE DONE FOR NEIL GORSUCH AND 
NOW FOR YOU. 
WHO PAYS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
FOR THAT? 
AND WHAT ARE THEIR EXPECTATIONS?
THAT IS A DEEP DARK SECRET. 
THESE GROUPS ALSO FIND 
REPUBLICAN ELECTION CAMPAIGNS 
WITH STARK MONEY AND KEEP THE 
IDENTITY OF -- WITH DARK MONEY 
AND KEEP THE IDENTITY OF DONORS 
A SECRET. 
AND OF COURSE 90% OF YOUR 
DOCUMENTS TO US ARE A DEEP, 
DARK SECRET. 
ONCE THE NOMINEES ARE ON THE 
COURT, THE SAME GROUPS WITH 
TIES TO THE KOCH BROTHERS AND 
THE POLITICAL MACHINE FILE 
FRIEND OF THE COURT OR AMICUS 
BRIEFS TO SIGNAL THEIR WISHES 
TO BE ROBERTS FIVE. 
WHO IS REALLY BEHIND THOSE 
FRIENDS? 
THAT IS ANOTHER DEEP, DARK 
SECRET. 
IT HAS GOTTEN SO WEIRD THAT 
REPUBLICAN JUSTICE IS NOW EVEN 
SENTENCE BACK TO BIT -- SEND 
HINTS BACK TO BIG BUSINESS 
INTERESTS ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD 
LIKE TO HELP THEM NEXT AND THAT 
BIG BUSINESS LAWYERS RUSH OUT 
TO LOSE CASES, TO LOSE CASES, 
JUST TO RUSH UP BEFORE THE 
FRIENDLY COURT PRONTO. 
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 
FREDRICKSON JANICE EPISODE. 
THE U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS 
THE BIGGEST CORPORATE LOBBY OF 
THEM ALL. 
FOR BIG COLD, BIG OIL, BIG 
TOBACCO, BIG PHARMA, YOU NAME 
IT, AND THIS YEAR WITH JUST 
DISCOURSE-ISH -- JUST DISCOURSE-
ISH -- JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH, 
THEY HAVE GONE MORE THAN THREE 
QUARTERS OF THEIR TOTAL VOTES. 
THIS YEAR IN ALL CIVIL CASES 
THEY VOTED FOR THE CHAMBER 
POSITION FULLY 90% OF THE TIME. 
AND IN THESE A 5-4 CASES I 
HIGHLIGHTED, 100%. 
PEOPLE ARE NOTICING. 
BETTERING COURT WATCHERS 
DESCRIBE THE SERVICE TO THE 
PUBLIC INTEREST. 
IT WAS WRITTEN THAT ON THE 
SUPREME COURT ROBERTS HAS 
SERVED THE INTEREST OF THE 
CONTEMPORARY REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE 
REPUBLICAN APPOINTED MAJORITY 
IS COMMITTED TO HARNESSING THE 
SUPREME COURT TO AN IDEOLOGICAL 
AGENDA. 
IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE 
NEW REALITY OF THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
IT IS POLARIZED ALONG PARTISAN 
LINES IN A WAY THAT PARALLELS 
OTHER POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS 
AND THE REST OF SOCIETY IN A 
FASHION WE HAVE NEVER SEEN. 
AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC KNOWS 
IT. 
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THINKS THE 
SUPREME COURT TREATS 
CORPORATIONS MORE FAVORABLY 
THAN INDIVIDUALS COMPARED TO 
VICE VERSA BY A 7 TO 1 MARGIN. 
49% OF AMERICANS THINK 
CORPORATIONS GET SPECIAL 
TREATMENT. 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT WHERE YOU FIT 
IN. 
A REPUBLICAN POLITICAL 
OPERATIVE YOUR WHOLE CAREER. 
YOU HAVE NEVER TRIED A CASE. 
YOU MADE YOUR POLITICAL BONES 
HELPING THE SALACIOUS 
PROSECUTION OF PRESIDENT 
CLINTON AND LEADING PROSECUTION 
INFORMATION TO THE PRESS. 
AS AN OPERATIVE IN THE SECOND 
BUSH WHITE HOUSE, YOU 
CULTIVATED RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
POLITICAL INSIDERS LIKE -- ON 
THE D.C. CIRCUIT YOU GAVE MORE 
THAN 50 SPEECHES TO THE 
FEDERALIST SOCIETY. 
THAT LOOKS LIKE AUDITIONING. 
ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT, YOU SHOWED 
YOUR READINESS TO JOIN THE 
ROBERTS FIVE WITH BIG POLITICAL 
WINS FOR CORPORATE AND 
POLITICAL INTEREST. 
UNLEASHING SPECIAL INTEREST 
MONEY INTO ELECTIONS, 
PROTECTING CORPORATIONS FROM 
LIABILITY, HELPING POLLUTERS 
POLLUTE, STRIKING DOWN COMMON 
SENSE GUN REGULATIONS, KEEPING 
INJURED PLAINTIFFS OUT-OF-COURT 
AGAINST CORPORATIONS, AND 
PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE 
CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE OVAL 
OFFICE, EXPOUNDING A NEARLY 
LIMITLESS VISION OF 
PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY FROM THE 
LAW. 
YOUR ALIGNMENT WITH RIGHT-WING 
GROUPS WHO CAME BEFORE YOU AS 
FRIENDS OF THE COURT, 91%. 
WENT BIG BUSINESS TRADE 
ASSOCIATIONS WAITING, 76% -- 
WEIGHED IN, 76%. 
THIS IS WHAT CORPORATE CAPTURE 
OF THE COURTS LOOKS LIKE. 
THERE ARE BIG EXPECTATIONS FOR 
YOU. 
THE SHADOWY DARK MONEY FOR 
GROUP THE JUDICIAL CRISIS 
NETWORK IS SPENDING TENS OF 
MILLIONS IN DARK MONEY TO PUSH 
FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION. 
THEY CLEARLY HAVE BIG 
ÃºEXPECTAT 
RULE ON DARK MONEY. 
THE NRA HAS POURED MILLIONS 
INTO YOUR CONFIRMATION 
PROMISING THEIR MEMBERS THAT 
YOU WILL BREAK THE TIE. 
THEY CLEARLY HAVE BIG 
EXPECTATIONS ON HOW YOU WILL 
VOTE ON GUNS. 
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON McGAHN 
ADMITTED THERE IS A COHERENT 
PLAN HERE. 
WHERE ACTUALLY THE JUDICIAL 
SELECTION AND THE DEREGULATORY 
EFFORT ARE REALLY THE FLIP SIDE 
OF THE SAME COIN. BIG POLLUTERS 
CLEARLY HAVE BIG EXPECTATIONS 
FOR YOU ON THEIR DEREGULATORY 
EFFORT. 
FINALLY, YOU COME BEFORE US 
NOMINATED BY A PRESIDENT NAMED 
IN OPEN COURT AS DIRECTING 
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND THE 
SUBJECT OF ONGOING CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION. 
YOU DISPLAYED EXPANSIVE VIEWS 
ON EXECUTIVE IMMUNITY FROM THE 
LAW. 
IF YOU ARE IN THAT SEAT BECAUSE 
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BIG 
EXPECTATIONS THAT YOU WILL 
PROTECT THE PRESIDENT FROM THE 
DUE PROCESS OF LAW, THAT SHOULD 
GIVE EVERY SENATOR PAUSE. 
TOMORROW WE WILL HEAR A LOT OF 
CONFIRMATION ETIQUETTE. 
IT IS MOSTLY A SHAM. 
YOU KNOW THE GAME. 
IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE, YOU 
COACHED JUDICIAL NOMINEES TO 
JUST TELL SENATORS THAT THEY 
HAVE A COMMITMENT TO FOLLOW 
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT AND 
WILL ADHERE TO STATUTORY TEXT 
AND THAT THEY HAVE NO 
IDEOLOGICAL AGENDA. 
FAIRYTALES. 
AT HIS HEARING, JUSTICE ROBERTS 
INFAMOUSLY SAID HE JUST CALLED 
BALLS AND STRIKES, BUT THIS 
PATTERN, 73-0 OF THE ROBERTS 
FIVE, QUALIFIES HIM TO HAVE 
NASCAR STYLE CORPORATE BADGES 
ON HIS ROADS. 
A LETO SENATE AFFAIR BUT A 
STRONG -- -- JUSTICE ALITO TOLD 
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY THAT 
THINGS NEED TO LEAVE DECIDED 
WHEN IT SUITS OUR PURPOSES. 
JUSTICE GORSUCH PROVIDED THE 
KEY VOTE IN THE UNIONBUSTING 
DECISION. 
HE ALSO PLEDGED IN HIS HEARING 
TO FOLLOW THE LAW OF JUDICIAL  
JUSTICE GORSUCH. 
ASSURED US HE WAS NOT A 
PHILOSOPHER KING AND PROMISED 
TO GIVE EQUAL CONCERN TO EVERY 
PERSON , POOR RICH, MIGHTY OR 
MEEK. 
HOW DID THAT TURN OUT? 
GREAT FOR THE RICH AND MIGHTY. 
JUSTICE GORSUCH IS THE SINGLE 
MOST CORPORATE FRIENDLY JUSTICE 
ON A COURT ALREADY FULL OF 
THEM, REALLY FOR BIG BUSINESS 
INTERESTS IN OVER 70% OF CASES  
AND IN EVERY SINGLE CASE WHERE 
HIS BOAT WAS DETERMINATIVE. 
THE PRESIDENT EARLY ON ASSURED 
EVANGELIC IS HIS SUPREME COURT 
PICKS WOULD ATTACK ROE V WADE. 
DESPITE CONFIRMATION ETIQUETTE 
ASSURANCES ABOUT PRECEDENT, 
YOUR OWN WORDS MAKE CLEAR YOU 
DON'T REALLY BELIEVE ROE V WADE 
IS SETTLED LAW SINCE THE COURT, 
AS YOU SAID,  CAN ALWAYS 
OVERRULE ITS PRECEDENT.  
MR. CHAIRMAN, WE HAVE SEEN THIS 
MOVIE BEFORE. 
WE KNOW HOW IT ENDS. 
THE SAD FACT IS THAT THERE IS 
NO CONSEQUENCE FOR TELLING THE 
COMMITTEE FAIRYTALES ABOUT 
STARE DECISIS AND THEN WRITING 
OFF WITH THE ROBERTS FIVE, 
TRAVELING ACROSS WHATEVER 
PRECEDENT GETS IN THE WAY  OF 
LETTING THOSE BIG REPUBLICAN 
INTERESTS KEEP WINNING 5-4 
PARTISAN DECISIONS. 
73-0 MR. KAVANAUGH. 
EVERY TIME.  
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> SENATOR TED CRUZ. 
>> CHAIRMAN, I HAVE SOME 
DOCUMENTS TO SUPPORT THIS. 
-- SENATOR -- 
>> THANK YOU JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
WELCOME. 
WELCOME TO YOUR FAMILY.  
YOU HAVE BEEN FRIENDS OF OURS 
FOR 20 YEARS. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR DECADES OF 
PUBLIC SERVICE, AND I AM SORRY 
THAT YOUR DAUGHTERS HAD TO 
ENDURE THE POLITICAL CIRCUS OF 
THIS MORNING. 
THAT IS THE WORLD THAT IS 
WASHINGTON IN 2018. 
I WANT TO DISCUSS WHAT THIS 
HEARING IS ABOUT AND WHAT IT IS 
NOT ABOUT. 
FIRST, THIS HEARING IS NOT 
ABOUT THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE 
NOMINEE. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS BY ANY 
OBJECTIVE MEASURE 
UNQUESTIONABLY QUALIFIED FOR 
THE SUPREME COURT.  
EVERYONE AGREES IS ONE OF THE 
MOST RESPECTED FEDERAL JUDGES 
IN THE COUNTRY. 
HE HAS IMPECCABLE ACADEMIC 
CREDENTIALS, EVEN IF HE DID GO 
TO YALE. 
AND YOU SERVED OVER A DECADE ON 
THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR 
THE D.C. CIRCUIT, OFTEN 
REFERRED TO AS THE SECOND 
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. 
SO OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES 
ARE NOT TRYING TO MAKE THE 
ARGUMENT THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
IS NOT QUALIFIED. 
I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYONE EVEN 
ATTEMPT  TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT. 
SECOND, THIS HEARING IS NOT 
ABOUT HIS JUDICIAL RECORD. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS OVER 300 
PUBLISHED OPINIONS, WHICH 
ALTOGETHER AMOUNT TO OVER 
10,000 PAGES  ISSUED IN HIS 
ROLE AS A FEDERAL APPELLATE 
JUDGE. 
EVERYONE AGREES A JUDGES RECORD 
IS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT 
INDICATION OF WHAT KIND OF 
JUSTICE THAT NOMINEE WILL BE. 
AND TELLINGLY, WE HAVE HEARD 
VERY LITTLE TODAY FROM 
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS ABOUT THE 
ACTUAL SUBSTANCE OF YOUR 
JUDICIAL RECORD. 
THIRD, IT IS IMPORTANT TO 
UNDERSTAND TODAY IS ALSO NOT 
ABOUT DOCUMENTS. 
WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF 
ARGUMENTS THIS MORNING ABOUT 
DOCUMENTS. 
THERE IS AN OLD SAYING FOR 
TRIAL LAWYERS, IF YOU HAVE THE 
FACTS, POUND THE FACTS. 
IF YOU HAVE THE LAW, POUND THE 
LAW. 
IF YOU HAVE NEITHER, POUND THE 
TABLE. 
WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF TABLE 
POUNDING THIS MORNING. 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE FOCUSED ON 
PROCEDURAL ISSUES BECAUSE THEY 
DON'T HAVE SUBSTANTIVE POINTS 
STRONG ENOUGH TO DERAIL THIS 
NOMINATION. 
THEY DON'T HAVE SUBSTANTIVE 
CRITICISM WITH YOUR ACTUAL THE 
OFFICIAL RECORD, SO THEY'RE 
TRYING TO DIVERT EVERYONE WITH 
PROCEDURAL ISSUES. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS 
FOR MOMENT. 
THE CLAIMS THAT THE DEMOCRATS 
ARE PUTTING FORWARD ON 
DOCUMENTS DON'T WITHSTAND ANY 
SERIOUS SCRUTINY. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS PRODUCED  
511,948 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS. 
THAT INCLUDES MORE THAN 17,000 
PAGES IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE 
COMMITTEE WRITTEN 
QUESTIONNAIRE, WHICH IS THE 
MOST COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE 
EVER SUBMITTED TO THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
THE MORE THAN 500,000 PAGES OF 
DOCUMENTS TURNED INTO THIS 
COMMITTEE IS MORE THAN THE 
NUMBER OF PAGES WE HAVE 
RECEIVED FOR THE LAST FIVE 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES COMBINED.
LISTEN TO THAT FACT AGAIN. 
THE OVER 500,000 DOCUMENTS 
TURNED OVER TO THIS COMMITTEE 
IS MORE THAN THE LAST FIVE 
NOMINEES SUBMITTED TO THIS 
COMMITTEE COMBINED. 
SO WHAT IS ALL THE FUSS OVER 
THE DOCUMENTS NOT TURNED OVER? 
MOST OF THOSE CONCERNED YOUR 
THREE YEARS AS THE STAFF 
SECRETARY FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE 
W. BUSH. 
MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT A 
STAFF SECRETARY DOES. 
BUT THAT IS THE POSITION IN 
CHARGE OF ALL THE PAPER THAT 
COMES INTO AND OUT OF THE OVAL 
OFFICE. 
CRITICALLY, THE STAFF SECRETARY 
IS NOT THE AUTHOR OF THE PAPER 
COMING INTO AND OUT OF THE OVAL 
OFFICE. 
THAT PAPERS TYPICALLY WRITTEN 
BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, BY THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE, BUT OTHER 
CABINET MEMBERS, BY OTHER 
SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS. 
THE STAFF SECRETARY IS SIMPLY 
THE FUNNEL FOR COLLECTING THEIR 
VIEWS AND THEN FOR TRANSFERRING 
THE PAPER BACK AND FORTH. 
IN OTHER WORDS, THOSE DOCUMENTS 
WRITTEN BY OTHER PEOPLE SAY 
NOTHING, ZERO, ABOUT THE VIEWS 
OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND NOTHING, 
ZERO, ABOUT WHAT KIND OF 
JUSTICE  JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD 
MAKE.  
BUT THEY ARE, BY NECESSITY, THE 
MOST SENSITIVE AND CONFIDENTIAL 
DOCUMENTS ANY WHITE HOUSE. 
THEY ARE THE DOCUMENTS GOING TO 
THE PRESIDENT. 
THIS IS THE ADVICE AND DOUBLE 
RATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT AT THE 
SENIOR LEVEL AND THE STAFF 
SECRETARY IS THE CONDUIT FOR 
THOSE DOCUMENTS. 
SO WHY IS IT THAT THE DEMOCRATS 
ARE PUTTING SO MUCH ENERGY IN 
SAYING HAND OVER ALL OF THOSE 
DOCUMENTS? 
BECAUSE THEY KNOW, THEY KNOW 
BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, 
THAT PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH 
AND HIS WHITE HOUSE TEAM ARE 
NOT GOING TO ALLOW EVERY PIECE 
OF PAPER THAT WENT TO THE 
PRESIDENT TO BE MADE PUBLIC 
ANYMORE THAN ANY OTHER WHITE 
HOUSE WOULD. 
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, NO 
WHITE HOUSE WOULD ALLOW EVERY 
PIECE OF PAPER THAT WENT TO AND 
FROM THE PRESIDENT TO BE MADE 
PUBLIC. 
INDEED, THERE ARE RULES AND 
LAWS AND PROCEDURES FOR WHEN 
AND HOW PRESIDENTIAL PAPERS 
BECOME PUBLIC. 
AND THE REASON THE DEMOCRATS 
ARE FIGHTING SO LOUDLY ON THIS 
ISSUE IS --. IT WOULD OPEN UP 
ALL SORTS OF FISHING 
EXPEDITIONS TO ATTACK, 
RELITIGATE THE RECORD OF GEORGE 
W. BUSH AS PRESIDENT AND WHAT 
VARIOUS CABINET MEMBERS AND 
SENIOR VISORS MIGHT OR MIGHT 
NOT OF SAID. 
BUT IT IS AT THE END OF THE DAY 
IS SIMPLY AN ATTEMPT TO 
DISTRACT AND DELAY. 
AND INDEED, THE MULTIPLE 
MOTIONS WE HAVE SEEN FROM 
DEMOCRATS, DELAY THIS 
CONFIRMATION, THAT REVEALS THE 
WHOLE JOKE. 
THE OBJECTIVE IS DELAY. 
SO WHAT IS THIS FIGHT ABOUT? 
IT IS NOT ABOUT DOCUMENTS, IS 
NOT ABOUT THE CREDENTIALS OF 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WHAT IS THIS 
FIGHT ABOUT?  
I BELIEVE THIS FIGHT IS NOTHING 
MORE AND NOTHING LESS THAN AN 
ATTEMPT BY OUR DEMOCRATIC 
COLLEAGUES TO RELITIGATE THE 
2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 
2016 WAS A HARD-FOUGHT ELECTION 
ALL AROUND. 
IT WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION IN 60 YEARS WHERE 
AMERICANS WENT TO THE POLLS 
WITH A VACANT SEAT ON THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
ONE THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT 
WOULD FILL. 
AMERICANS KNEW WHO HAD BEEN IN 
THAT SEAT, THE LATE JUSTICE 
ANTONIN SCALIA, ONE OF THE 
GREATEST JURISTS EVER TO SIT ON 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
PRESIDENT DWIGHT EISENHOWER HIS 
 
SUPREME COURT SEAT WAS DIRECTLY 
ON THE BALLOT. 
BOTH CANDIDATES KNEW THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THE VACANT 
SUPREME COURT SEAT. 
IT WAS A MAJOR ISSUE OF 
CONTENTION IN THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION. 
DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY 
CLINTON WERE BOTH CLEAR ABOUT 
WHAT KIND OF JUSTICES AND 
JUDGES THEY WOULD APPOINT. 
DURING ALL THREE PRESIDENTIAL 
DEBATES, BOTH CANDIDATES WERE 
ASKED, WHAT QUALITIES WERE MOST 
IMPORTANT TO THEM WHEN 
SELECTING A SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE. 
THE ANSWER BY SECRETARY CLINTON 
WAS QUICK, SHE WANTED A JUSTICE 
WHO WOULD BE A LIBERAL 
PROGRESSIVE WILLING TO REWRITE 
THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, WILLING 
TO IMPOSE LIBERAL POLICY AGENDAS
THAT SHE COULD NOT GET THROUGH 
THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. 
ÃºTHAT T 
STATES WOULD NOT ADOPT, BUT 
THAT SHE HOPED FIVE UNELECTED 
LAWYERS WOULD FORCE ON THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
THAT IS WHAT HILLARY CLINTON 
PROMISED FOR HER JUDICIAL 
NOMINEES. 
THEN CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP 
GAVE A VERY DIFFERENT ANSWER. 
HE SAYS HE WAS LOOKING TO 
APPOINT JUDGES IN THE MOLD OF 
JUSTICE SCALIA. 
HE SAID HE WANTED TO APPOINT 
JUDGES WHO WOULD INTERPRET THE 
CONSTITUTION BASED ON ITS 
ORIGINAL PUBLIC MEETING. 
WHO WOULD INTERPRET THE STATUTES
ACCORDING TO THE TEXT AND WHO 
WOULD UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW 
AND TREAT PARTIES FAIRLY 
REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE OR 
WHERE THEY COME FROM. 
THEN CANDIDATE TRENT -- THEN 
CANDIDATE TRUMP HAD DID 
SOMETHING THAT NO PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE HAS DONE BEFORE, HE 
WOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF 
NOMINEES. 
PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
ALL OF THIS WOULD LAY BEFORE 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS THEY 
WENT TO THE POLLS ON NOVEMBER 
8, 2016. 
AND THE IT. 
OF PEOPLE MADE A CHOICE THAT I. 
MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES ARE 
NOT HAPPY WITH THE CHOICE THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE MADE. 
BUT AS PRESIDENT OBAMA FAMOUSLY 
SAID, ELECTIONS HAVE 
CONSEQUENCES. 
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAD 
THE CHANCE TO VOTE A NATIONAL 
REFERENDUM ON THE DIRECTION OF 
THE SUPREME COURT, I HAVE SENT 
A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT JUSTICE 
-- THAT THE NOMINATION OF 
JUSTICE GORSUCH AND THIS 
NOMINATION HAVE ALMOST A SUPER 
LEGITIMACY IN THAT THEY WERE 
RATIFIED, DECIDED  BY THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A DIRECT 
VOTE IN 2016. 
IS SO THE DEMOCRATIC 
OBSTRUCTION TODAY IS ALL ABOUT 
TRYING TO REVERSE THAT 
ELECTION. 
THEY ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE 
CHOICE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT.
AND THERE IS A REASON THAT THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT STRONG 
CONSTITUTIONALISTS ON THE US 
SUPREME COURT. 
MOST AMERICANS, AND I KNOW THE 
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF TEXANS,
WANT JUDGES WHO WILL FOLLOW THE 
LAW AND WILL NOT IMPOSE THEIR 
POLICY PREFERENCES ON THE REST 
OF US AND WHO WILL BE FAITHFUL 
TO THE CONSTITUTION AND THE 
BILL OF RIGHTS. 
JUSTICES WHO WILL UPHOLD 
FUNDAMENTAL LIBERTIES LIKE FREE 
SPEECH, LIKE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, 
LIKE THE SECOND AMENDMENT. 
THAT IS WHAT THE SELECTION WAS 
ABOUT, AND IF YOU LOOK AT EACH 
OF THESE. 
LET'S TAKE FREE SPEECH. 
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT IN 2014 
EVERY DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THIS 
COMMITTEE VOTED TO AMEND THE 
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION TO 
REPEAL THE FREE-SPEECH 
PROVISIONS OF THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT. 
AND SADLY, EVERY DEMOCRAT IN 
THE SENATE AGREED WITH THAT 
POSITION. 
VOTING TO GIVE CONGRESS 
UNPRECEDENTED POWER TO REGULATE 
POLITICAL SPEECH. 
IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR THIS 
INSTITUTION. 
YEARS EARLIER, TED KENNEDY, THE 
GREAT LIBERAL LION, OPPOSED A 
VERY SIMILAR EFFORT. 
INTENT KENNEDY SAID WE HAVE NOT 
AMENDED THE BILL OF RIGHTS -- 
AND TED KENNEDY SAID WE HAVE 
NOT AMENDED THE BILL OF RIGHTS 
IN OVER 200 YEARS, NOW IS NOT 
THE TIME. 
THE SENATE HAD THE COURAGE TO 
AGREE WITH HIM AND SUPPORT FREE-
SPEECH. 
THEY VOTED PARTYLINE TO REPEAL 
THE FREE-SPEECH PROVISIONS OF 
THE FIRST AMENDMENT. 
THAT IS RADICAL AND EXTREME AND 
PART OF THE REASON THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE VOTED FOR A PRESIDENT 
WHO WOULD PUT JUSTICES ON THE 
COURT WHO WOULD PROTECT FREE 
SPEECH. 
HOW ABOUT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY? 
THAT IS ANOTHER FUNDAMENTAL 
PROTECTION. 
THAT THE DEMOCRATS IN THE 
SENATE HAVE GOTTEN EXTREME AND 
RADICAL ON. 
INDEED, OUR DEMOCRATIC 
COLLEAGUES WANT JUSTICES WHO 
WILL RUBBERSTAMP EFFORTS LIKE 
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 
EFFORTS LITIGATING AGAINST THE 
LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR. 
LITIGATING AGAINST CATHOLIC 
NUNS TRYING TO FORCE THEM TO 
PAY FOR ABORTION INDUCING DRUGS 
AND OTHERS. 
THAT IS A RADICAL AND EXTREME 
PROPOSITION AND TO SHOW JUST 
HOW DRAMATIC SENATE DEMOCRATS 
HAVE GOTTEN, EVERY SINGLE 
SENATE DEMOCRAT JUST A FEW 
YEARS AGO VOTED TO GUT THE 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION 
ACT. 
LEGISLATION THAT PASSED 
CONGRESS WITH OVERWHELMING 
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN 1993 AND 
WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY BILL 
CLINTON. 
YET DUDE -- THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY DETERMINED RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM WAS INCONVENIENT. 
THEY WANT JUSTICES THAT WILL 
FURTHER THAT ASSAULT ON 
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. 
AND FINALLY LET'S TAKE THE 
SECOND AMENDMENT. 
THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, 
HILLARY CLINTON EXPRESSLY 
PROMISED TO NOMINATE JUSTICES 
WHO WOULD OVERTURN HELLER 
VERSUS DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 
THAT IS THE LANDMARK DECISION 
ISSUED BY JUSTICE SCALIA, 
LIKELY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 
DECISION OF HIS ENTIRE TENURE 
ON THE BENCH. 
IT UPHELD THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT 
TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. 
THE HILLARY -- HILLARY CLINTON 
WANTED JUDGES WHO WOULD 
OVERTURN IT AND AND NUMBER OF 
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES WANT THAT 
AS WELL. 
OVERTURNING THIS I BELIEVE WILL 
BE A TRULY RADICAL PROPOSITION. 
TO UNDERSTAND WHY, YOU HAVE TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CENTER IS. 
THE SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTS 
NO INDIVIDUAL TO KEEP AND BEAR 
ARMS WHATSOEVER. 
THAT IT PROTECTS MERELY A 
COLLECTIVE RIGHT OF THE 
MILITIA. 
THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT RADICAL 
PROPOSITION WOULD MEAN THAT 
CONGRESS COULD PASS A LAW 
MAKING IT A FELONY, A CRIMINAL 
OFFENSE, FOR ANY AMERICAN TO 
OWN ANY FIREARM. 
AND NEITHER YOU NOR I NOR ANY 
AMERICAN WOULD HAVE ANY 
INDIVIDUAL RIGHT WHATSOEVER 
UNDER THE SECOND AMENDMENT. 
WOULD EFFECTIVELY ERASE THE 
SECOND AMENDMENT FROM THE BILL 
OF RIGHTS. 
THAT IS A BREATHTAKINGLY 
EXTREME PROPOSITION. 
WHAT HILLARY CLINTON PROMISED 
HER JUSTICES WOULD DO. 
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT 
IS WHAT THIS FIGHT IS ABOUT. 
WE KNOW THAT EVERY DEMOCRATIC 
MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE IS 
GOING TO VOTE NO. 
WE DON'T HAVE TO SPECULATE. 
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS 
PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED, THEY ARE 
VOTING NO. 
DOESN'T DEPEND ON WHAT THEY 
READ IN DOCUMENTS OR WHAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH SAYS AT THIS HEARING. 
THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED AHEAD OF 
TIME THEY ARE VOTING IN A. IN 
MOST OF THE DEMOCRATS IN THE 
SENATE HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT IN 
THE FULL SENATE. 
BUT EVERYONE SHOULD UNDERSTAND, 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS HANDED OVER 
MORE DOCUMENTS THAN ANY NOMINEE 
. MORE THAN THE LAST FIVE 
COMBINED. 
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT. 
IS NOT ABOUT DOCUMENTS, IT IS 
NOT ABOUT QUALIFICATION, IT IS 
NOT ABOUT RECORD, IT IS ABOUT 
POLITICS. 
IT IS ABOUT DEMOCRATIC SENATORS 
TRYING TO RELITIGATE THE 2016 
ELECTION AND JUST AS 
IMPORTANTLY, WORKING TO BEGIN 
LITIGATING THE 2020 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 
THAT WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SPEAK. 
THEY DID AND VOTED IN 2016 AND 
THEY WANTED JUDGES WHO WOULD BE 
FAITHFUL TO THE CONSTITUTION. 
THAT IS WHY I AM CONFIDENT THAT 
AT THE END OF WHAT SHAKESPEARE 
WOULD DESCRIBE AS A LOT OF 
SOUND AND FURY SIGNIFYING 
NOTHING, I AM CONFIDENT THAT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL BECOME 
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH AND BE 
CONFIRMED  TO THE UNITED STATES 
SUPREME COURT. 
THINKING MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK 
NOW -- 
>> WAIT A MINUTE. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK 
NOW. 
30 MINUTES IS WHAT THE 
DEMOCRATS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. 
SO WE WILL RETURN AT 1:17 PM. 
SO BE ON TIME PLEASE.
>>>
THAT WAS PRETTY HEATED. 
IT STARTED OFF WITH FIREWORKS. 
>> THE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR
THE NECK SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, 
SHOULD IT HAPPEN, BRETT 
KAVANAUGH.
