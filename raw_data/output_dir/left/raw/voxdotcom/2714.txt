1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,880
This is James Thompson.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,220
And this is James Owens.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,340
They were both convicted in connection
with the same burglary, rape, and murder case.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,750
As you might expect the people on
Malvern Street are shocked and horrified

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,330
by the crime.
Colleen's brother and a friend

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,280
discovered the body last night.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,070
But nearly 20 years later DNA evidence from

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,880
the scene was tested and the results
showed neither of the men could have

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,020
committed the rape.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,980
James Owens walked out of prison a fully

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,840
exonerated man, but James Thompson he's still labeled a convicted felon.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,820
Same crime, same DNA results, very different
endings.

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,860
To figure out why, we have to

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,750
start at the beginning with a knife, a
lie, and a plea bargain that altered

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,440
their lives.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,580
It began with the murder of Colleen
Wilier in 1987.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,140
Thompson, a gas station

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,600
attendant lived down the street with his
wife and their two young boys.

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,020
There were helicopters and things flying around the
neighborhood, searching the top of the

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,640
building and things looking for murder
weapons, bloody clothes, anything of that nature

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,860
that could be linked to the crime.

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,140
He'd heard detectives were looking for a

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,160
knife and were offering a one thousand
dollar reward.

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,430
And I jumped on the first

25
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,149
chance I could get to take that. So I
goes back in the house and you know I

26
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:33,460
was stupid I guess you'd say, but I went into the
bedroom and I got a switchblade knife.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,740
And I took the knife out and this was the beginning of my whole situation.

28
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,610
Thompson told the police he found the
knife in the grass about half a block

29
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,800
from the crime scene.

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,830
They said to me,
they said well do you have any idea who

31
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,320
this knife belong to?

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,080
I said the knife was
stolen out of my house they said uh you

33
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,580
have any idea who took this knife at
your home?

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,220
And I told a lie and I said

35
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,120
yes, I do.

36
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,480
And I give them the name of a man, his name was

37
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,540
James Owens.

38
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,540
He and Owens were casual friends, until they

39
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,100
had a falling out over accusations of
theft.

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,640
In a burst of vengeance,

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,040
Thompson implicated Owens.

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,799
His bogus testimony and that knife became the crux

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,360
of the entire case.

44
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,520
They described it as
a mint green dagger an instrument

45
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,260
repeatedly used by the person who
murdered the 24-year old woman.

46
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,019
So at this point and that's all city police
have to go on, an unusual murder weapon

47
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,450
which they hope leads them to the
murderer.

48
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,260
James Owens was arrested for the crime.

49
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,620
They never did look for any other suspects.

50
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,680
But they wasn't happy with the
things I was telling them.

51
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,560
Thompson's version of the events changed multiple
times throughout Owens' trial.

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,460
He started to look like an unreliable witness.

53
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,620
Even the prosecutor admitted his story was "implausible".

54
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,080
Worried that they might lose their case

55
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,080
against Owens, the detectives found a new
focus.

56
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,760
A couple months after the crime

57
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:16,590
actually was committed, one of the
detectives said wait a minute, Mr. Thompson

58
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,780
seemed to know too much to not
have been involved in the crime himself.

59
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,540
They took a sample of Thompson's hair
and tested it against a hair found on

60
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,040
the victim. It came back a match.

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,920
The hair analysis method used would later become

62
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,370
known as junk science, but at the time it
was enough for the detectives to pin

63
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,220
down a theory that both Owens and
Thompson were involved in the crime.

64
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:50,200
In what was his eighth version of events,
Thompson eventually gave a false confession.

65
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,140
I testified to exactly what
they wanted me to testify to, I said

66
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,140
exactly what I was instructed to say.

67
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,580
The state convicted Owens for the
burglary and murder and Thompson for the

68
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,240
burglary, rape, and murder.

69
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,410
They were both
sentenced to life in prison without the

70
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,100
possibility of parole.

71
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,680
The only thing that could feasibly save
them was the emergence of DNA science.

72
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,780
Owens first heard about DNA in prison. He
saw his friend and fellow inmate Kirk Bloodsworth,

73
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,520
become the first American
man on death row to be exonerated by DNA testing.

74
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,700
And then, the OJ Simpson case
popularized the science.

75
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,900
The answer will be clear to you as well.

76
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,760
I said to myself,

77
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,440
wow I wonder if I had any in mine.

78
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,000
So a couple my friends in prison that was

79
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,940
jailhouse lawyers, helped me. We wrote
letters to the coroner's office and it

80
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,300
came back there was DNA.

81
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,840
Owens was asking
for it to be tested ever since he had

82
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,380
been wrongfully convicted and had become
aware that there was such a thing as DNA testing.

83
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,700
But no one would test it.

84
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,380
Lawyer Stephen Mercer, who represented both

85
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:11,140
Owens and Thompson in their individual
cases, pushed for the DNA testing of two samples.

86
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,500
One slide contained sperm taken
from the victim.

87
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,660
Also tested was the

88
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:24,110
blood that was on James Thompson's
shorts, that police collected the day

89
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,380
after Colleen Wilier's body was found.

90
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,100
I couldn't sleep like two days, three days,

91
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,700
I said man, I said I might be
going home.

92
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,280
And there it was.

93
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,860
The DNA came back,

94
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,081
said it wasn't mine.

95
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:43,010
The results showed the sperm sample didn't match

96
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,600
either of the men.

97
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,240
And the blood on
Thompson's shorts was his own.

98
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,460
Owens was

99
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,810
granted a new trial. It would likely be
months or even years away. The state

100
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,080
offered him a chance to go free
immediately, if he did one thing:

101
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,840
take an obscure deal called an Alford plea.

102
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,300
Plea bargains aren't surprising.

103
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,540
They're
the lifeblood of an overburdened

104
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,820
criminal justice system, where 95% of
cases are resolved through plea agreements.

105
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,260
But the Alford Plea is unique.

106
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,380
It began with North Carolina versus

107
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:23,520
Alford in 1970, when a man named Henry
Alford was charged first degree murder.

108
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,889
The state offered Alford a deal. If he
pled guilty to second-degree murder, he

109
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,400
wouldn't be sentenced to die.

110
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,210
Alford took it, but in court he insisted

111
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,080
that he was innocent and he was only
pleading guilty to avoid death.

112
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,360
The Supreme Court held that someone who
insists that they are innocent on the

113
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,500
record, can still plead guilty to a crime
and accept the status of a convicted felon.

114
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,440
The deal also allows prosecutors to keep

115
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,500
a win on the books and admit no
wrongdoing.

116
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,919
To this day, 47 states and the

117
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,680
District of Columbia allow the plead.
For Owens, who was imprisoned for over 20 years,

118
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,020
the Alford plea offered immediate
freedom, but at the cost of living with a

119
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,580
label of a murderer.

120
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,840
I look at it like this:
why would I go into court and plead

121
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,800
guilty to something I didn't have
nothing to do with?

122
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,000
I was in prison for 21 years.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,660
I'm not taking no Alford plea.

124
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,620
He took a chance with the trial, when his

125
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,860
day in court came 16 months later, the
state dismissed his case.

126
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,039
It was the best

127
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,960
feeling in my whole entire life.
Just to get out of jail.

128
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,940
And he walked

129
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:38,729
out of that prison with a garbage bag
over his shoulder, with all of his

130
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:45,810
worldly possessions, but more important
than what was in that bag, was that his

131
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,940
principles were intact, because he
insisted on his day in court. When

132
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,220
confronted with that, the state folded.

133
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,420
But for Thompson, things moved much
slower.

134
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,420
He was still waiting to secure a

135
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,100
new trial.

136
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:10,100
In that uncertainty, the state
came forward and offered him an Alford plea.

137
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,000
It was his ticket out.

138
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,419
I was tired being

139
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,960
in prison I wanted to go home.

140
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,600
And the deal sounded real good at that point, I mean

141
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,980
it was like the man was offering me a
chance at life again, so I took it.

142
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:36,360
I was released that day, February the 28th 2010,
but I didn't know that by taking the

143
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,380
Alford plea, that it would still mean that I was guilty.

144
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,380
I would still have that on my record for the
rest of my life and then there would be

145
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,980
nothing I could ever do in regard to my
false imprisonment.

146
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,019
The lives of Thompson

147
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,290
and Owens are case studies in what
happens when you take a plea

148
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,020
or wait for exoneration.

149
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,060
Owens has a
steady job with his cousin's company

150
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,080
installing gutters.

151
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,240
In his spare time he
takes care of his cousin's kids.

152
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,560
I'm 52 years old. Is it right for me to have
kids now?

153
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,180
No, because I shouldn't be 70 years old when my daughter graduated from high school.

154
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,629
You know? I did 21 years.

155
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:25,140
There was nobody can ever give me that
back. Nobody.

156
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,449
Not a judge or a jury can give

157
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:28,960
me back the time that I lost.

158
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,920
And I feel
that I should be compensated for what I

159
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,880
went through.

160
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,639
He's now suing three detectives for the

161
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,680
mishandling of his case and the time
he's lost.

162
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,529
If I could get a settlement I

163
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:43,060
would probably take $100,000, $200,000.

164
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,279
Put it into an account

165
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,610
where I can help inmates, other
inmates that were in the prison system

166
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,420
and they were saying I'm innocent.

167
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,660
You know I would pay for the DNA.

168
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,589
Just to get

169
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:57,480
this person out of jail, just to prove to
the state of Maryland look you're wrong.

170
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,660
Then, there's Thompson who lives with the
stigma of being a convicted felon and is

171
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,160
unable to sue the state for false
imprisonment.

172
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,140
Need one worker unload box.

173
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,400
Box fielders in Salisbury at 6:00
a.m.

174
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,620
What I do, I text them back I say

175
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,199
this is James I will do it. Right now the
only jobs I can get are through a temp

176
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:27,750
agency, because every time I fill out a
job application, the first question on

177
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,880
have you ever been convicted of a felony?

178
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,360
Yes I have been convicted of a felony.

179
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:39,209
I mean it's it's hard. I'd like to
have a good permanent job you know, where

180
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:41,580
I could get 40 hours a week.

181
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,420
No one will
hire me because of my record.

182
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,200
Society does not believe that innocent people go to prison.

183
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,700
When I went to prison I had two boys, I

184
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,680
have not seen either one of them since
they were small children and I missed

185
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,790
out on having the opportunity to be a
father to them and raise them and things.

186
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,560
And I've really missed that because now
you know I won't ever have the

187
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,120
opportunity to be a dad again.

188
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,480
Thompson
and Owens' lives diverged but are

189
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,460
still connected through the same case,

190
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,900
a crime that won't be reinvestigated.

191
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,780
To this day they have an unsolved murder.

192
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,120
They don't feel that way because, they

193
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,520
convicted me. The whole case was
revolved around me and Mr. Owens and

194
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,700
was closed at that point.

195
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,860
I'd like to have the opportunity to be able

196
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,890
to sit down and apologize to him for
what I did and for you know the amount

197
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,280
of time of his life that I actually feel
that I took from him.

198
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,900
I can never give

199
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,760
that back, no more than I can
give back the 20-some years on my own life,

200
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,880
but I think I would feel a little
bit better in the heart,

201
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,060
just to be able to to say I'm sorry .

202
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,380
I mean, for whatever
it's worth.

203
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,600
Hey guys thanks for watching!
Since these cases, one of the prosecutors

204
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,860
has died and another prosecutor involved
in Thompson's case wouldn't talk to

205
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,490
ProPublica about why she thought the
Alford plea was a fair bargain.

206
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,780
ProPublica has been reporting on cases
like these for over a year, but it's

207
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,680
especially difficult since no one tracks
how often the wrongfully convicted are

208
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,260
pressured into accepting an Alford plea
instead of being exonerated.

209
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,480

Thanks.
