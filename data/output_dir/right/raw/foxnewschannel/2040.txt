1
00:00:10,373 --> 00:00:11,007
>> Greg: IN THE LATEST

2
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:11,741
INSTALLMENT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

3
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:12,641
AN ELECTION THAT OCCURRED A YEAR

4
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:14,577
AND A HALF AGO, MICHELLE OBAMA

5
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:16,344
WAS ASKED HOW TRUMP WON, AND SHE

6
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:17,947
LAY THE BLAME ON HILLARY.

7
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:19,181
JUST KIDDING.

8
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:21,584
SHE BLAMED SEXISM FROM WOMEN

9
00:00:21,584 --> 00:00:22,585
AGAINST WOMEN.

10
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:26,555
>> IN LIGHT OF THIS LAST

11
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:27,556
ELECTION, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT

12
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:28,958
US AS WOMEN AND HOW WE THINK.

13
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,760
IF WE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,129
THE NOTION THAT A WOMAN COULD BE

15
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:35,765
OUR PRESIDENT COMPARED TO WHAT?

16
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:38,367
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT

17
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:39,568
CONVERSATION WITH OURSELVES AS

18
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:40,569
WOMEN.

19
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:42,371
>> Greg: MAYBE SO, BUT HER

20
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:44,206
ANALYSIS SEEMS A SYMPTOM OF A

21
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:45,541
GREATER PROBLEM THAT CONTRIBUTED

22
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,176
TO HER PARTY'S LOSS.

23
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:00,000
GOES BACK TO SEEING THE GROUP
