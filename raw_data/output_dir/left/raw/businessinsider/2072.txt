1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,589
before you buy the new iphone you should

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,080
decide which version is right for you do

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,840
you want the iphone 6 or 6 plus and you

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,309
need 16 64 or 128 gigabytes let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

5
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the differences between the six and</font>

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the six plus the biggest difference here</font>

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,660
is size the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a 4.7 inch</font>

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,810
screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's larger than the 5s the 6</font>

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,570
plus has a 5.5 inch screen which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,119
obviously way bigger so keep in mind the

11
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,890
six plus probably won't fit in your

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,680
pants pocket the larger screen is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,649
better quality but it weighs more the

14
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,629
cameras on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 and the 6 plus are the</font>

15
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,239
same except the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 plus has a stabilizer</font>

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,760
so if you're like my mom Joyce the queen

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,920
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fuzzy iphone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pic you may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,379
spring for the six plus the hardest

19
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,000
decision for most people is trying to

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,590
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how much storage they need</font>

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,960
the best place to start first consider

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,780
how much storage you already use if you

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,460
have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone go to settings and you</font>

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,230
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much storage your pictures</font>

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,739
video and music take up but here are

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,110
some general<font color="#E5E5E5"> estimates a 64 gigabyte</font>

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,490
device can hold about 28,000 photos or

28
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,670
7,000 songs or 32 hours of video but

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,920
apps take up space to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> app</font>

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,500
maybe only about 30 megabytes but there

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some apps that take up a lot of</font>

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,060
space particularly intense gaming apps

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,030
where some are over 1 gigabyte each now

34
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,369
for the big news you used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have to pay</font>

35
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,530
two hundred dollars more to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a 64</font>

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,590
gigabyte iphone now 64 gigabytes only

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,560
costs one hundred dollars more plus you

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,180
can store some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your content on the</font>

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,310
cloud and Apple has lowered its iCloud

40
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,890
prices the first five gigabytes of

41
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,020
iCloud storage is free but if you need

42
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,939
more you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get 200 gigabytes for</font>

43
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,149
forty-eight dollars a year of course

44
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,920
deciding between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> six and the sixth</font>

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,630
plus comes down to a personal preference

46
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,969
for me I want something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can fit in my</font>

47
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">pocket so I'm going with an iPhone 6 as</font>

48
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,299
for size the 128 gigabyte device is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,939
best value per byte but it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

50
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">value for you if you need the space so</font>

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,530
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> only necessary for hardcore</font>

52
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,360
gamers and anyone that wants to keep

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,010
their entire video collection

54
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,010
on their actual device for me 64

55
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,319
gigabytes is a sweet<font color="#E5E5E5"> spot I won't run</font>

56
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,480
out of space but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if I do I can move</font>

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,810
some of my stuff to the cloud the 16

58
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,730
gigabyte version is really only for

59
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,170
people who are good about keeping their

60
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,420
phone squeaky clean this might be enough

61
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">space if you regularly delete apps and</font>

content store on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud word of</font>

warning just don't store your naked

pictures on the cloud keep those on your
