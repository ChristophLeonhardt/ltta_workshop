“The United States, like
many other countries,
suffers from a lack of trust.”
Rob Porter was a high-
ranking White House
aide with a low public profile.
He was the man responsible for
managing all documents that
were seen by the president.
But unlike some
people Donald Trump
brought to the
White House, Porter
was no stranger to
Washington politics.
“One of the president’s
most trusted advisers.”
“She says he choked her.”
“He says he’s innocent.”
Porter was
forced to resign after his two
ex-wives came forward
with allegations
of domestic violence.
“Rob followed me to the
shower and pulled me out
of the shower to
continue the rage.”
Former classmates and
colleagues described
Porter as confident and capable,
but others described his behavior
as cocky and overly ambitious.
He served as chief of staff
for Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah
for over two years.
The clean-cut Republican
went to Harvard Law School
and was a Rhodes scholar.
“Indeed, in these three areas
the facts of the campaign
point to George W. Bush as
the clear and essential choice
for president of
the United States.”
His father was a former aide
to President George H.W. Bush
and is a professor at
Harvard.
While in law school,
Porter took two years off to go
on a Mormon mission in London.
Both of Porter’s
ex-wives have spoken out
about the Mormon church’s 
role in their relationships.
Jennifer Willoughby said
Recently, The
Daily Mail reported
that Porter was in a
relationship with Hope Hicks
the White House communications
director.
Porter was a rising star 
in Washington politics.
His abrupt exit puts
another unwanted spotlight
on the White House.
