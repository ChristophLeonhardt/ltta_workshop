1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,390
they're with their parents it depends
but look it sounds cold and it sounds

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,429
hard we have a country our country is
going to hell the dreamers having to do

3
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,089
with children and you know the dreams of
children and these are people that come

4
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,020
over the country the dreamers and I said
what about our children our children I

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,250
want the children that are growing up in
the United States to be dreamers also

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,429
they're not dreaming right now we will
immediately terminate President Obama's

7
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:35,730
to illegal executive amnesty
under daca that we already have people I

8
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,500
think military is a very special thing
if they plan on serving if they get in

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,450
I would absolutely hold those people now
we have to be very careful we have to

10
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,520
vet very carefully everybody would agree
with that

11
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,579
they shouldn't be very worried I do have
a big heart we're going to take care of

12
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,879
everybody we're going to have a very
strong border we're gonna have a very

13
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,510
solid border where you have great people
that are here that have done a good job

14
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,760
they should be far less worried some
absolutely incredible kids I would say

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,030
mostly they were brought here in such a
way it's a very it's a very very tough

16
00:01:15,030 --> 00:00:00,000
subject we are going to deal with daca
with heart
