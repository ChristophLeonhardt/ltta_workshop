170
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,908
I THINK EVEN PEOPLE WHO DID NOT

172
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:06,077
IN 2016 ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR

174
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:10,548
ARE CHANGING FOR THE BETTER.

175
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:13,151
THEY HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR

176
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:13,484
POCKETS.

177
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:15,620
THEIR 401(K) IS GOING UP.

178
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:17,121
THEY COULD FINALLY SEND THEIR

179
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:18,356

180
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:19,757
BETTER FOR THEIR FAMILY.

181
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:21,192
TAKE A FAMILY VACATION FOR THE

182
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:22,160
FIRST TIME IN YEARS.

183
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:23,628
THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE IN THIS

184
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,363

185
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:27,365
THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS

186
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:28,166

187
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,669
UNDER TRUMP, ALL OF THAT IS TRU

188
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,970
