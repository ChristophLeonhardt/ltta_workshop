1
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,679
One thing I do think about a
lot is the pollution because

2
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,889
I see it, especially living so
close to these, these containers

3
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:34,380
like there's some, I don't know 
what's coming out of them, I really don't,

4
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,480
but the smell, sometimes is very
strong like ammonia.

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,340
It gets you, like sometimes it
just hurts when you breathe it,

6
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,420
breath in, 
you have to go inside.

7
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,370
People say well,
why don't you move?

8
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,190
I wish I could.
I wish I could.

9
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,960
As soon as I get an 
opportunity, yeah I'll move.

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,469
It's just sad that
living here for so long,

11
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,840
we do have a lot of memories
here. I mean all my kids are

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,819
born here and stuff.

13
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,129
But I've learned to just live
with it.

14
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:21,630
Mainly we're just 
taking it day by day.

15
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,199
It's just something normal 
for for me and my family.

16
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:27,619
You would think, man 
there's families there,

17
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,400
but it's about the money.
They don't care about families

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,900
they don't care about you.
They don't care how it's affecting you.

19
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,350
We don't have a voice, you know.
We could go complain

20
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,249
to the civic leaders, we
could go and email our

21
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:49,949
whatever representatives and stuff.
Until now, I have not seen

22
00:01:49,949 --> 00:00:00,000
anything done, 
nothing.
