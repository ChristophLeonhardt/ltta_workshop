the investigation into germanish of g's possible murder continues all eyes are now on the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who appears to be distancing himself from the scandal but can he really and will it affect his grip on power this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Haslam seeker Saudis close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may be involved in what Turkish sources say is the killing of Saudi journalist Jim al khattab G and as it has been told that a bodyguard for the Crown Prince led the operation which led to her Shoji's torture and death in Istanbul he was last seen entering the Saudi consulate 15 days ago or joint Saudi Turkish investigation team searched the building Turkish sources say there is further evidence that suggests keshavjee was killed there the Saudis are continuing to deny any links to his disappearance u.s. President Donald Trump is defending the Kingdom warning not to jump to conclusions the US Secretary of State has been in both Ankara and the Saudi capital after meeting King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Mike Pompeo says a credible investigation is underway and no one will be exempt from being held accountable they made a commitment to to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that whether they are a senior officer official they promised accountability for each of those persons whom they determined as a result of their investigation has deserves accountability they made no exceptions to who they would hold accountable they were they were just spirit they were very clear they understand the importance of this issue they are determined to get to the bottom of it and that they will conduct the report and we'll all get a chance to see it they they each promised that they would achieve that for us well let's bring in our guests now to talk more about this joining us here in studio is mohammad sheikh ali professor of conflict resolution at George Mason University in London we have Syed it's a hobby he is a columnist with a Kurds newspaper and leader of the Bahrain freedom movement and joining us from Chicago is sana chapter director of the Turkish research program with the Washington Institute for Near East policy good to have you all with us gentlemen let's start with the the Turkish perspective on this since that is that is at the center of all of this so Sonia chapt I as far as the latest developed developments that we're getting on this now more details about what the Turks say is is that a killing has taken place in the consulate and there is a search now of the Consul generals residence what do we expect to emerge from there and what will investigators be looking at so what we saw is Turkey first started releasing evidence to suggest that an ax murder took place and then last week on Friday just as a president's arrow on and Trump made up after Turkey released American pastor Andrew Brunson was in jail in Turkey that was the reason for the Trump aired on make up turkey went into a strategic pause it stopped releasing evidence unnamed Turkish security officials stopped talking to journalists and I think that is primarily because Iran was hoping that behind closed doors he would convince Trump and the US administration now that he had made up with Trump to publicly back Turkish position but we saw in the last few days that if not the whole US administration definitely President Trump is trending away from Turkey's position and closer to the Saudi position and I think therefore the Turks have start decided to start leaking evidence again so yesterday secretary Pompey was in Ankara US State Department of state and I think it's either to build pressure on secretary Pompeo or perhaps even so that he takes a message back to Washington that Turkey will not back down turkey started releasing evidence again journalists who had access to audio tapes or who talked to people at access to audio tapes started painting the details of this gruesome murder so I think turkeys back in the offensive now whether this is a strategic offensive it will last or tactical depends on to what extent the u.s. position aligns with Turkey especially once secretary Pompeo comes back I think at this stage turkish President Erdogan can take nothing less than not just a complete apology but someone pretty significant and important thrown under the bus so that he will accept to embrace the exit path that the Saudi authorities want to take claiming that this was not a clear operation when the murder took place I think it's getting more complicated than everyone thought in the last week and it all depends on what America does next and certainly when you say someone needs to be thrown under the bus who would that person be I mean how how high would it have to go up it's hard for me to judge I'm not an expert on Saudi politics but I saw today that the council in Istanbul the Saudi council was relieved of his duties that just doesn't sound convincing to the Turks that the whole operation of 15 people allegedly flying into Istanbul at the same time that Kosugi was at the consulate staying there for two hours and leaving and if the audio tapes are indeed verified carrying out a murder that all of this could have taken under just the auspices of the council I think it would have to be go higher than that but I'm not an expert on Saudi politics can say how high but clearly there are two elements here one is that the alleged murder took place on Turkish soil so it's a violation of turkeys sovereignty and Turkey is very envious of that and secondly Khashoggi is somebody who had really close ties to many people in the air Tawana administration so this is also personal for Iran he has to push back in order to not to have his charisma and his strongman image domestically and international we undermined and I think that's why if the Saudis are to take the code encode exit path they have to give something in return that is convincing for Iran but also for the international audience that is watching this terrible tragedy Mohammed Sheikh Ali what's your take on how the Turks have handled this investigation because there is a delicate balance at play here in terms of Turkey's relations with both Saudi Arabia and the United States two countries which which has a great deal invested here I would say that the Turks have manipulated this process of figuring out what happened so we have not seen the full story of what they have discovered in terms of evidence so there has been this diplomatic process going on in the first two weeks we breed and then now with Riyadh and Washington so I think the I mean Dirks have not revealed their evidence because they are more concerned or more interested in development a new triangle where they can have a win-win situation so our Dogon happens to be somebody who is tough negotiator and I think now with the arrival of Chris Brunson at the White House I think there has been new rapprochement with Washington on this is the American preacher who was released from Turkey from so I don't think that he was released without a kind of compromise and I think the Saudis are paying the price both ways to the Turks as well as the Americans and at the same time the keshavjee scandal now happens to be a new low in Saudi politics and I think we should also remember that our Dogon and the soured leadership leadership leaders have not been on good terms so we have we still have to wait to see where this investigation process will lead us within the next three months four months so from what you're saying then the Turks are keeping their cards very close to the vest here and and and there it's a matter of when when they when they play themselves well we have seen how the evidence has been manipulated it has been a process of a drip drip you know anonymous I'm mrs. anonymous sources and also with some selective media institutions inside Turkey so I don't think that this is the proper legal way had it been in London or elsewhere we would have seen the prosecutor or the Ministry of Interior appearing before cameras day one or day two he or she would reveal what the the outcome of the investigation and also sort of tell us what is the the point of the marking demarcation between what is evidence and what is just speculation so I think probably in short the Turks have turned this scandal of Hobbes's dead into a circus of political and diplomatic circus more than the whole process Oh all right let's get let's get Sadie should have his take on this should should Turkish investigators just simply be able to do their jobs here regardless of the political and diplomatic considerations are they being allowed to do that thank you very much I listened to both contributors and I can see that everybody is not really clear about how the Turks are conducting their own investigation and also how they are calculating their next move but so far I think for Turkey so far so good because they have not rushed to judgment they have not rushed to declaring a position they have not exposed all the information in their hands so they are in a stronger position especially I think one of the most important thing that I personally for example didn't think that the the the mr. Trump and his administration would take such a strong stand with regard to Saudi Arabia yes they are trying to brush aside to brush it off they are trying to probably to protect the Saudis but at the same time there is so much evidence and so much media attention inside America that I think the Whitehouse could not simply brush all this aside and and cling to their position they had originally so the tags have been manipulative enough to be able to drag the Trump administration into this mess and I think the stakes they made the stakes too high for Riyadh to come out from this quagmire so I believe that the text will continue their investigation and as my colleague earlier said they will continue to give small hands one one at a time in order to talk to really close the surface around the the Saudis because the Saudis have done really really bad job not just now and the texts have also been very skeptical and angry about the way they had the Saudis had handled many other issues several other issues including their relations with cotton this is madness this is absolute madness and the world is coming to realize that Mohammed bin Salman has been a disaster for the west and for especially for America yes he is giving money but at the same time he is making everybody unhappy around in the region so I think the texts have played their cards oh so well so far but also they are also afraid that the the Trump administration may stand at the middle of the way and back up or back away from the whole process well we just want to remind viewers as well at this point that we did make several efforts to reach out to Saudi voices on this or a band pro Saudi voices but we were unsuccessful we're gonna expand a little bit on this now to talk about the implications that this have for the United States and for Mohammed bin Salman now u.s. President Donald Trump criticized the rush to condemn Saudi leaders in an interview with The Associated Press he said well I think we have to find out what happened first you know here we go again with you're guilty until proven innocent I don't like that we just went through that with just this Cavanaugh and he was innocent all the way so I was unconcerned a u.s. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is accusing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of ordering the journalists murder well I know this nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without NBS knowing it who's MBA he's the 33 year old crown prince who jumped over other people he's the son of the existing King and I think he's on a bad track I can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind us right and what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia as long as this guy's in charge so you're selling the crown prince has to leave this up to them but I'm not going I've been their biggest defender on the floor of the United States Senate this guy is a wrecking ball he had this guy murdered in a consulate in Turkey and expect me to ignore it I feel used and abused I was on the floor every time defending Saudi Arabia because there's a good allied there's a difference between a country and an individual the NBS figure is to me toxic he can never be a world leader on the world stage what is the president's up to the president but what I would do I know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia you know we deal with bad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended they have nothing but contempt for us why would you put a guy like me and the president in this box but after all the president has done this guy's got to go Saudi Arabia if you're listening there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS is tainted your country and tainted himself all right pretty direct comments there from Lindsey Graham u.s. Republican senator not not pulling his punches there as we just heard and he interestingly enough is a senator who has been very close to president Trump politically what do you make of that couple of interesting points now the rush over his death I'm sorry to say has become the hisagi deal both in finance and politics in two dimensions one the Turks have utilized this scandal to improve their relations with the White House and they are getting what they want at the same time it the way I went the more I listened to Senator Lindsey Graham and others who are representing mainstream politics within the Republican Party I sense that this is an investment in an aunty Trump platform toward the elections in November midterms and also in 2020 because Lindsey Graham is one of the strong candidates who would like to be taken seriously so there are several corners or several players who are betting on how to manipulate and how to capitalize on her sugar is dead and this is not really where it seems to me now due by the third week of this problem we have moved from the tree that has hidden the entire forest and these are these new trees that we are discovering everybody is trying to make a bet and make some capital over his death side is happy what do you make of this then in terms of what it means for Mohammed bin Salman does this kind of put the brakes on on the way he has pursued power at at any cost well I think the world has waited too long for this man to go they didn't act I mean he waged a war on Yemen why why did huge a war in Yemen now that more than 10 million are on the brink of famine and the whole world is condemning except the politicians condemning that war he he kidnapped the Lebanese Prime Minister who do that have you ever hear a government could not pick the prime minister of another country as simple as that just and he was a guest of honor in his courtyard so and now he has done this and of course the way he did with the GCC has destroyed the GCC the Gulf Cooperation Council he destroyed it it is almost 40 years now since it was in the established in February 1981 and now he has destroyed it well I don't think there will be any talk of the real DCC no revamping of the Jesus year again after what he did by excluding cata by attacking it and having enmity even with it with a man which start with the Sultanate of Oman and also I'm getting Kuwait when he wanted it to take a stand against Qatar but the Emir of Kuwait didn't do that so he in the last three four years since 2015 when his uncle passed away he has brought disaster after disaster after disaster to his own country and which to OD or any other leader would antagonize his own family and arresting them and putting them in the rest in the Ritz at this for two or three months and then extracting their money for I mean all right second my did you do you think that there's gonna be any pushback against him then inside Saudi Arabia does anyone there have the power to do that I think only if the Americans are willing to accept a change and I am not sure whether he has left anywhere anyone behind with integrity and strong character because he has humiliated everybody and I am Not sure I think there is a rare is a serious case for a regime change in Saudi Arabia this this this regime has failed its own people before failing the world and before failing the other concepts like a human rights and dignity and security so I believe that it is time that the world really really looks seriously at the possibility of a regime change in that Kingdom because the outcome so far in the last few years have never been never been except disasters and insecurity so we just heard from side they're calling this disaster after disaster for Mohammed bin Salman but do you think what's happened in Istanbul will ultimately be his undoing now I think the problem here and here I am thinking of Lindsey Graham's comments is that taking into account that American foreign policy has two heads White House and the Congress this is a seems to be a pretty significant public implemented debacle force at Arabia in Washington especially judging from the Congress side and I think this explains Lindsey Graham's comments here's why we don't really know what happened because we're have the full tape or full evidence of the alleged murder at the consulate whether this was a rendition that went wrong or they wanted to intimidate Khashoggi or torture him or torture him to death but either way it's completely unacceptable here's why it's not that the Saudis in my view targeted and potentially killed a dissident it looks like they did it's not that they targeted a journalist looks like they did it's not that they did all of this on Turkish soil therefore creating a crisis with Turkey they did but they also targeted a Washington Post columnist and I think there's really no way to dig from under this that's America as one of the most prominent papers most respected read by everybody in Washington there's not a single person in Washington DC including senators who don't have 50 Washington Post columnist in their address book on their phone so this is very clear to close to home for so many people and I think it is because it is the Washington Post columnist aspect of this alleged murder that makes it really difficult for the Saudi royal family to dig under this and just say it was a minor incident it wasn't cleared I think that we haven't really seen the end of it I also believe that air Doha will continue pushing I think that ideally a Dawn's plan a is to not have a rupture with the Saudis that's why he was hoping that Trump would mediate between him and the crown prince and that's why he didn't divulge full evidence I think this is the reason why the Turkish tactics so far has been drip drip and erawan has been absent he hasn't personally charged the Saudis he had unnamed officials of the Turkish government to it that's because his plan is to avoid a complete rupture but increasingly I think if the Saudis do not take the kind of exit path that aired or one wants them to take this could lead into a more sea dicken political event that we offer rupture I think it's something turkey is avoiding it's probably why everyone took a call from the Saudi King and they spoke and so I would say that's still his plan a is still where he wants to go he doesn't want to be going to be forced into Plan B that would be a complete rupture with the Saudis and of course that means at least an a dozen at perhaps ten countries that would follow the Saudis that would enter a rupture with Turkey so that will be a significant blow to Turkey's foreign policy and its ambitions in the Middle East all right we'll give what's probably going to be the last word on this then to Mohammed how do you see this playing out then is this something that the Saudis can ultimately ride out or will we see something else happen I think this is a moment of throat in Riyadh for Riyadh Hamid Vinson man has become number one enemy to Mohammed bin Salman if his father and the entire government said Arabia I think he has picked I mean his power picked a long time ago even and I would go back to early summer 2018 with the controversy of the Aramco hypu and how King Salman say laughter say is there a 5% that was supposed to bring 100 billion dollars for the 22 revision it didn't work King Salman intervened and stopped deafening so I think if in in terms of political sociology his momentum was exhausted a long time ago and there is now a decline of his power although he managed to establish a kind of deep state within the Saudi state and I'm not kind of in favor of the idea that we should have this ambitious expectation that he will be removed or there will be a regime change in Riyadh I would say that he will be sidelined for a while he will disappear from the public eye till the king kind of find a compromise where he is still part of the decision-making and his son would remain Chrome all right it'll be fascinating to see how this does continue to play out what we're going to have to leave it there thank you to all of you
