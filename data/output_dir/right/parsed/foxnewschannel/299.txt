>> President Trump: I'D LIKE
TO THANK ANOTHER MAN WHOSE
PRINCIPAL LEADERSHIP HAS EARNED
A WIDESPREAD ADMIRATION.
CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE, SENATOR CHUCK
GRASSLEY.
THANK YOU, CHUCK.
>> Martha: THAT JUDICIARY
CHAIRMAN WAS AT THE CENTER OF
THE STORM, WHO TODAY SPENT HIS
FIRST DAY IN THE ROGAN ON THE
COURT.
I SAT DOWN EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE
SENATOR IN THE VERY ROOM WHERE
KAVANAUGH AND FORD'S DRAMATIC
TERROR TESTIMONY PLAYED OUT.
GRASSLEY HAS SEEN 15
CONFIRMATION HEARING SINCE HE
JOINED THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
BACK IN 1981.
HE HAS NOT SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
THIS.
>> LAST NIGHT THE
PRESIDENT THANKED DEAL AT THE
SWEARING IN.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRINCIPAL
LEADERSHIP AND HE SAID THAT YOUR
HANDLING OF THE CONFIRMATION
EARNED A WIDE SPREADING
ADMIRATION, BUT THIS WAS
CHALLENGING FROM THE GET-GO.
WHEN HE BEGAN THE FIRST HEARING,
KAMALA HARRIS AND CORY BOOKER
BOTH WANTED TO DEREGULATE RIGHT
OUT OF THE GATE.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I'D LIKE TO ASK
QUESTIONS BEFORE I PROCEED.
>> I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE MYSELF
OR ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS INCREDIBLY
POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENT.
>> IT'S VERY DIVIDED, BUT DON'T
FORGET AT THE GRASSROOTS OF
AMERICA IT'S DIVIDED AS WELL.
IF YOU WANT CONGRESS TO REFLECT
THE GRASSROOTS, YOU SHOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED IF SOME OF IT
PERMEATES UP TO THEIR GOAL.
HOPEFULLY IT IS A BETTER EXAMPLE
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE
SITUATION.
WHERE I STARTED OUT WAS TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE HAD A FAIR AND
THOROUGH HEARING, AND EVEN
THOUGH IT TOOK A LONG -- LONGER
THAN THE AVERAGE SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE TAKES BY ABOUT THREE OR
FOUR WEEKS, I THINK WE STILL HAD
A FAIR AND A THOROUGH METHOD
THAT I PROMISED THE PEOPLE AND
EVERYONE HAD A CHANCE TO VOICE
THEIR CONVICTIONS.
>> SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT THIS
PROCESS WAS MORE CONTENTIOUS OR
MORE VICIOUS FROM WHAT WE'VE
SEEN IN THE PAST?
>> IT WAS VERY MUCH MORE
CONTENTIOUS.
I DON'T WANT TO LEAD PEOPLE TO
BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A WAY
CONGRESS IS GOING TO FUNCTION
INTO THE FUTURE, EXCEPT MAYBE ON
JUDGES, YES.
BUT LEGISLATION GENERALLY, NO.
WE CAN WORK IN A BIPARTISAN WAY.
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
THOSE WHO SAW WHAT WAS REVEALED
ABOUT JUDGE CAVANAUGH IN THE
FINAL HEARING THIS, AS TOO
POLITICAL, TO PARTISAN?
LAST NIGHT WHEN HE WAS THINKING,
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE INVOLVED,
THE ONLY THANKED THE REPUBLICAN
SENATORS WHO WERE PART OF THE
PROCESS.
WAS THAT A MISTAKE?
>> I DON'T WANT TO BE IN JUDGE
CAVANAUGH
AND KAVANAUGH'S HAD TO BUT I
THINK HE IS LOOKING INTO THE
FUTURE AND WHEN HE GOES TO THE
SUPREME COURT WHERE IT IS THIS
VERY WEEK, THERE IS AN -- I HOPE
BETWEEN THE REPUBLICANS AND
DEMOCRATS MEET TOGETHER AS PART
OF THE GROUP AND HE WILL BE PART
OF THAT TEAM.
AND WHEN HE EXPRESSED SO THAT A
FACT OF LIFE IN HIS SPEECH LAST
NIGHT, THE REPUBLICANS WERE
GENERALLY GOING TO AGREE WITH
HIM.
AND KNEW HE HAD THE
QUALIFICATIONS BOUND THE COURT.
AND THE DEMOCRATS KNEW HE HAD
THE QUALIFICATIONS TO BE ON THE
COURT BUT THEY WERE GOING TO
MAKE SURE HE DIDN'T GET ON THE
COURT.
>> Martha: IN TERMS OF THE
ALLEGATIONS THAT CAME AGAINST
BRETT KAVANAUGH, THE MOST
EXTREME OF THE ONE THAT CAME
FROM JULIE'S WET NECK AND HER
ATTORNEY, MICHAEL AVENATTI.
WAS AT A TURNING POINT IN ALL OF
THIS, DO YOU BELIEVE?
>> I THINK WITH HIS REPUTATION
THAT HE IS ESTABLISHED AS A
LAWYER THAT THAT RAISED
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY.
THEY HAVE TO ALL BE TAKEN VERY
SERIOUSLY BECAUSE UNTIL RECENT
YEARS THERE WASN'T VERY MUCH
THOUGHT GIVEN ABOUT IT.
AND IT'S A GOOD THING THAT THE
ME TWO MOVEMENT HAS COME ABOUT
BECAUSE, IT DID BRING THE
CREDIBILITY THAT OUGHT TO BE
BROUGHT.
I THINK DR. FORD BROUGHT
CREDIBILITY TO THE WHOLE ISSUE,
AND BEYOND THAT, YOU KNOW, A
RACE OF QUESTIONS.
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN YOU LOOK
AT THE PROTESTERS, AND HOLDING
POSTERS THAT THEY SOME OF THEM,
LIKE OLD WHITE MEN CAN'T BE FAIR
ABOUT THESE ISSUES?
>> FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE ONLY
TWO OF US ON THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE THAT ARE OLD AND I'M
ONE OF THEM.
EVERYONE ELSE IS YOUNG.
SO I DON'T LIKE TO BRING RACIST
ISSUES AND TO ADD, I LIKE TO SEE
PEOPLE AS AMERICANS FIRST AND
ONLY AS AMERICANS.
AND YOU CAN BE BACK IN AND YOUR
BACKGROUND.
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO NOT DIVIDE
AMERICA, I WOULD LIKE TO THINK
THAT WE ARE ALL AMERICANS
BRINGING AMERICANS TOGETHER, NOT
SEPARATING AMERICA.
BUT I WISH WE HAD WOMEN ON THE
REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE -- >>   CRITICIZED THE
OTHER DAY SAYING YOU COULDN'T
GET WOMEN TO BE IN THIS
COMMITTEE IN THIS ROOM, MAYBE
THAT'S TOO MUCH WORK.
>> I SHOULDN'T HAVE ACCEPTED THE
PREPOSITION THAT WOMEN ARE NOT
ON ON IT.
WE HAD TO FIND THREE MEN THAT
WOULD SERVE ON IT, BUT NOT
BECAUSE OF WORK, IT'S BECAUSE
THEY IDEOLOGICALLY DIVIDED.
AND ALSO FROM THE STANDPOINT,
THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WE
MEET, ALMOST EVERY THURSDAY
DESCENDANTS AND SANCTIONS, WE
HAVE AN EXECUTIVE SESSION.
AND MOST DON'T HAVE AN EXECUTIVE
SESSION EVERY YEAR LIKE WE DO.
SO WHETHER YOU ARE A MAN OR
WOMAN THERE IS A LOT OF WORK ON
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
>> Martha: WILL THERE BE AN
EFFORT TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE
DIVERSITY ON THIS COMMITTEE?
>> OF COURSE THERE WILL BE, AND
THERE SHOULD BE.
>> Martha: SUSAN COLLINS WHO
GAVE A SEMINAL SPEECH WHEN SHE
ESTABLISHED SHE WAS GOING TO
VOTE YES, IS BEING ROUNDLY
CRITICIZED.
SHE WAS CALLED A FAKE FEMINIST
AND NOW THERE IS $3 MILLION IN A
FUND-RAISING EFFORT AGAINST HER
IN MAINE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
THAT CRITICISM IT'S ABSOLUTELY
ABOMINABLE THAT THEY WOULD SAY
THAT ABOUT HER FOR EVERYTHING
SHE STOOD FOR IN HER LIFETIME,
RELATED TO FEMINIST ISSUES.
SHE'S BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF
EVERYTHING.
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW
NARROW THE THINKING OF THE
OPPOSITION TO THE KAVANAUGH WAS,
THAT THEY WOULD SAY THOSE
EXTREMISTS AND ANTI-: POSITIONS
ABOUT A PERSON THAT HAS BEEN
WITH THEM MOST OF THE TIME.
>> TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY THAT
JUDGE CAVANAUGH WILL WEAR THE
ROBES.
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A
POSSIBILITY THAT THIS COURT IN
ITS NEW COMPOSITION COULD IN THE
FORESEEABLE FUTURE OVERTURN
ROE V. WADE?
>> NO.
BASED UPON WHAT KAVANAUGH SAID
BUT EVEN IF KAVANAUGH HADN'T
SAID IT, A LONGER A PRESIDENT IS
IN PLACE THE MORE APT IT IS TO
SAY ESTATE.
>> EVEN IF THERE IS MORE
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS INFORMATIVE
ABOUT WHEN A FETUS FEELS PAIN,
WE HAVE LOTS OF NEW INFORMATION
NOW SO IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY
OF THAT COULD LEAD TO THE
REEVALUATION OF ROE V. WADE?
>> I THINK STATE LEGISLATURES
ARE OPERATING IN THIS AREA
TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT IS
MORE BASED UPON MODERN MEDICINE
AND THE SCIENCE OF LIFE, TO FIND
ANSWERS AND PAIN IS ONE OF THEM.
THAT YOU WILL FIND SOME STATES
AND LAWS BEING UPHELD, BUT THAT
IS WAY SHORT OF OVERTHROWING
ROE V. WADE.
>> NANCY PELOSI WOULD LIKE TO
SEE ALL THE FBI DOCUMENTS THAT
WERE CALLED FROM THIS
INVESTIGATION MADE PUBLIC.
THERE ARE A LOT OF HEADLINES
THIS MORNING ON THE EDITORIAL
PAGES THAT THE RESISTANCE SHOULD
NOT BACK DOWN, AND IF THERE IS A
CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA, THAT JUST
BECAUSE AND KAVANAUGH IS NOW ON
THE COURT, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THE FIGHT THAT IS
UNDERTAKEN TO KEEP HIM FROM
THERE WOULD BE GIVEN UP.
WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE FUTURE
WITH REGARD TO THAT?
>> I THINK THAT THERE IS, IF
DEMOCRATS TAKE OVER THE HOUSE,
THE NEW CHAIRMAN WOULD BE THE
NEW CHAIRMAN OF NEW YORK.
HE SAID HE'S GOING TO DO THAT.
>> DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE
ENOUGH EFFORT TO TRY TO IMPEACH
IF DEMOCRATS TAKE THE I DON'T
THINK IT'S A WHITE SPEAK TO DO
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND IT
FOR A BASIS FOR IMPEACHING, BUT
DON'T YOU SEE ALL THIS TALK,
WHETHER IT WAS PRIOR TO
SATURDAY'S VOTE OR SINCE
SATURDAY'S VOTE, EVERY EFFORT
THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN THE LAST
MONTH HAS BEEN TO DETRACT FROM
HIS OUTSTANDING QUALIFICATIONS
AND ACADEMIC BACKGROUND.
AND HIS 12 YEARS ON THE D.C.
CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS, NOBODY
SAID THAT HE WASN'T QUALIFIED TO
BE.
SO WHEN THEY COULDN'T KEEP HIM
OFF THE BENCH, BY POINTING OUT
THAT HE WASN'T QUALIFIED, THEN
THEY THREW EVERYTHING AT HIM
THAT HE COULD.
THEY THREW IT ON THE WALL, IF IT
DIDN'T STICK ON A LONG, THINK OF
SOMETHING ON WEDNESDAY.
EVEN ON THE DAY THAT HE WAS
GOING TO BE DEVOTED TO THE
SUPREME COURT, THERE WERE STILL
PEOPLE DIGGING AROUND TO FIND
SOME REASON THAT THIS GUY
SHOULDN'T BE ON THE COURT.
>> Martha: DO YOU THINK THE
CHANGES IN THE FILIBUSTER RULES
FIRST FOR THE LOWER COURT JUDGES
AND IT NOW FOR THE SUPREME COURT
JUDGES, IS THERE ANY TURNING
BACK FROM THAT?
COULD ANYONE GET THROUGH THIS
PROCESS IF IT REQUIRED 60 VOTES
IN A CREDIT?
>> THE TWO PEOPLE ON THIS COURT
WOULD NOT BE THERE IF IT WEREN'T
FOR 60 VOTES.
BUT BETWEEN 1789 AND 2001, THERE
WASN'T FILIBUSTERS OF
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.
AND THEN, SHERMER -- WE TOOK THE
IDEOLOGY OUT OF IT.
HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT
GEORGE W. BUSH DIDN'T GET A
HISPANIC ON THE CARD.
IT'S A SAD PATTERN.
OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS CONTINUED BY
REPUBLICANS WHEN THERE WAS A
DEMOCRAT PRESENT AND IT
CONTINUES TODAY.
I WOULD LIKE FOR SOMEONE TO SIT
DOWN WITH ME THAT THE DEMOCRAT
AND SAY, WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF
THIS.
WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE
WAY THAT JUDGES WERE VIEWED
BETWEEN 1789 AND OF THE YEAR
2001 THAT IDEOLOGY DIDN'T PAY A
MAJOR ROLE.
IT WAS ONLY BASED UPON YOUR
CONFIDENCE AND YOU AND YOUR
JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT.
IN OTHER WORDS, WERE YOU GOING
TO BE A JUDGE OR A SUPER
LEGISLATURE?
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WENT INTO
IT.
THIS THING HAS BEEN IN A SINCE
THEN.
SOME PEOPLE SAY GRASSLEY, YOU'RE
WRONG, LOOK AT THE WAY THEY
TREATED BOURQUE.
LOOK AT THE WAY THEY TREATED
THOMAS.
THEN THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME
COMMON SENSE PREVAILED AND
GINSBURG AND BREYER WERE
APPROVED ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY.
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN GEORGE BUSH
GETS ELECTED PRESIDENT, THE
SUPREME COURT DECIDES HE OUGHT
TO BE PRESIDENT, INSTEAD OF
RECOUNTING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
OF VOTES, AND THAT IS WHEN
SCHUMER GAVE HIS SPEECH AND
THAT'S WHY THE WELL HAS BEEN
POISONED SENSE.
>> Martha: LAST QUESTION.
MARY GARLAND IS SOMEONE THAT A
LOT OF PEOPLE POINT TO AS THE
BEGINNING OF THE MOST RECENT
POISONING OF THIS PROCESS.
IF THERE IS AN OPENING ON THE
COURT, IN THE ELECTION YEAR, IN
2,020, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE
SENATE SHOULD TAKE UP A
NOMINATION DURING THAT PERIOD?
>> IF I'M CHAIRMAN, THEY WON'T
TAKE IT UP, BECAUSE I PLEDGED
THAT IN 2016, IF THE BULB IS THE
SAME AS IT IS -- YOU KNOW OF
