Frogs are not known
for their beauty.
But forget about the faces.
Look at their leaps.
They are spectacular jumpers.
They leap up and across.
They can even jump in tandem.
So what’s their secret?
Well, let’s look at a jump
and see the component parts.
The legs, see
them pushing off?
That’s where the
power comes from.
And the spine?
It’s rigid,
straight, so the frog
doesn’t uncurl as it jumps.
It unfolds, opening
at a hinge joint that
is unique to frogs.
That hinge — the
iliosacral joint,
to be technical — was
thought to be absolutely
necessary to the
evolution of frog jumping.
But a computer
simulation suggests
that jumping may
have evolved first
and the joint later to
improve their accuracy
and refine their jumps.
Understanding how that
works could help design
a prosthetic arm that has
both power and finesse.
Of course, there
are frogs that
take jumping to a
whole other level,
like the gliding tree frog.
It’s not flying, but it’s
certainly falling with style.
