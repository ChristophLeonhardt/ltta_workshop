our American friends have taken a strong moral stance against the PLO and Fatah exploitation of perennial Palestinian refugees and Canada has now stepped up to help the exploiters and the terrorists and Justin Trudeau is using your tax dollars to do it earlier this year the United States pulled all of its funding to the United Nations organization tasked with doling the cash back out to Palestinian leadership from The Times of Israel the United States was the biggest contributor to the agency's budget in 2017 donating 350 million dollars the US State Department said last month it would no longer fund Unruh because it was irredeemably flawed and now the United Nations is crying poverty and a 200 million dollar annual shortfall because instead of throwing good money after bad the Americans have offered a solution to the so-called refugee problem in Judea and Samaria and it was a real solution being offered to the United Nations by the Trump administration just look at this here in June Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Jared Kushner was willing to stop funding unruhe altogether and transfer the 300 million dollars the u.s. gives the agency to Jordan and other Arab nations who had taken the Palestinians so you see the Americans weren't actually going to pull all of their funding dedicated to helping the Palestinians instead they weren't going to give the money to the United Nations anymore what they were going to do was use the funding to finally put an end to the refugee problem and get the refugees situated in countries that are culturally appropriate for them within the region and actually make the Arab states in the Gulf finally step up and do something for once instead of just pointing at the Americans and the Israelis as the Great Satan and you know the little seyton the Canadian government under the leadership of Stephen Harper cut off all funding to Unruh in 2010 because of its close ties to the outlawed terrorist organization Hamas in November 2016 Justin Trudeau's liberals restored 25 million dollars of that cut off funding in March 2018 the federal Liberals again injected another ten million dollars in emergency funding to Unruh you can see all of our coverage on Justin Trudeau's aid and sympathy for Hamas at stop helping Hamas calm and now Justin Trudeau always wanted to stand on the wrong side of an issue especially if it gives him a chance you slap our American allies in the face is giving another 50 million dollars annually to Unruh oh and the federal government is doing it in direct response to the United States cutting their funding to this terror linked UN organisation the Liberals said as much according to reports in The Huffington Post Canada is earmarking 40 million dollars towards the basic education health and livelihood needs of millions of Palestinian refugees especially women and children that sounds benevolent but let's go back a little shall we the Palestinians so-called refugees are a special class of refugee with their own United Nations agency dedicated to helping just them the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees in the near East or as I called it earlier unruhe unlike other UN refugees who are fleeing war or famine or religious persecution and who are refugees only temporarily these refugees are able to inherit their refugee status from their parents and grandparents who were displaced by a war they lost 70 years ago they can live in normal apartment complexes in Ramallah or a neighborhood in Bethlehem as any other person might they are settled and often live in the same neighborhood for generations that the United Nations now calls a refugee camp for the purposes of ringing cash out of the Sterne world more people classified as refugees more $1 it's really just that simple this is what the American administration was trying to end by offering money to Arab states to settle these so-called refugees unruhe recognizes over 5 million Palestinians as refugees even though there are only several tens of thousands of original Palestinian refugees still alive if Israel is committing genocide as the left likes to cry this is the worst unsuccessful attempt at it I have ever seen and this is a prime example of how inept unruhe is if after 70 years of being tasked with solving this refugee problem there are now 5 million of them and growing the only reason refugee status for Palestinians is inheritable is because it's valuable just like any other thing you might inherit or will to someone each refugee is worth millions in funding to be funneled to corrupt ik rats and terror organizations right here according to the Middle East I which by the way is not a pro-israel publication at all in fact it routinely calls Israel an occupying force anyway according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or the OECD over 35 billion dollars in aid has been spent on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip between 1993 and 2016 and of the thirty five billion dollars around twenty four billion or 70% of the total aid was allocated between 2006 and 2016 at an average of 2.2 billion dollars per year and five hundred and sixty dollars per capita per year such figures make the Palestinians one of the top recipients of non-military per capita aid in the world so where on earth is all this money going well let's take a quick look at what happens in those unrest schools that Canada is now so committed to funding here that's a tiny tot terror dress-rehearsal and thanks to Canadian aid dollars now those kids will graduate well trained in the art of terror and we'll have a well-paying job in the global jihad when they grow up this is from the New York Post the new Palestinian Authority budget boosts support to terrorists in prison by 13% and aid for the families of those killed in the struggle against Zion 4% reports the Institute for contemporary affairs the total 344 million equals 49 point six percent of all foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority in other words cash from Uncle Sam Europe and even Israel is subsidizing welfare for terrorists the Palestinian Authority sends a salary to each Palestinian imprisoned for an attack on Israelis hitting over $3,000 per month after 30 years other stipends go to families of martyrs killed in the act that's three hundred and forty four million for 2017 that's not going to build roads or hospitals but friends that's not to say that some Palestinians living in Judea and Samaria are not doing well for themselves as international aid dollars rain down on them like manna from heaven I took a little trip over to the website of the Jerusalem Center for public affairs they have a photo album on their website devoted to documenting the luxury that exist for some Palestinians who claim to be living under this so-called oppressive Israeli occupation just look at some of these houses of rich Palestinians in Judea and Samaria while the UN cries poverty genocide occupation and apartheid at Israel unlike a near weekly basis so yeah of course unruhe is running out of funds to help these refugees that's because the money they send to help the so called displaced although completely resettled people ends up buying PLO and Fatah politicians fancy houses and nice cars and allows martyrs mothers to live in luxury because one of their sons knife to soldier kidnapped and murdered a tour guide or butchered and Israeli child as she lay in her bed and Trudeau is obviously aware of all this the entire world is aware of this the problem is some of the world thinks Israelis deserve to live in terror every single day but for Justin Trudeau it is most important to be seen as the global leader of the anti Trump cabal and to be seen by his progressive peers to be doing exactly the opposite of President Donald Trump and Trudeau will do that he is doing exactly that even if it means lining the pockets of butchers who exploit their own people to fulfill their vision of a world without Israel or without Jews because for Trudeau what's a few stabbed soldiers if it means you get to virtue signal about how much you aren't like President Donald Trump and for a liberal mainstream media that incessantly calls anybody to the right of Barack Obama alt right or white nationalist they're sure silent with their outrage now that liberals are proudly dishing over money to people who have the same ideology and endgame as modern neo-nazis for the rabble media I'm Shiela Gunray to see all of our ongoing coverage of how Justin Trudeau is forking over your money to this terrorist organization go to stop helping Hamas calm you
