00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
one of my all-time favorite quotes is

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,589
from Mother Teresa she said I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,930
paradox that if you love until it hurts

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,660
there can be no more hurt only more love

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,940
and I just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a really</font>

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,099
remarkable thing to say a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,980
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I received a big package and I</font>

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,470

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,090
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'm</font>

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,470
going to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> this now find out what's</font>

love means for the YouTube generation

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,799
people say young people can't be

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,290
bothered to take time to read or write

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,909

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,549
love letter have a place in an age where

33
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,740
heartfelt expression has been reduced to

34
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,080
lol's and smileys has the arts of

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,409

55
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,200
a serious note I am now a part of the

56
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,570
project called the LOL experiment where

57
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,240
I host a new video<font color="#E5E5E5"> every Friday in which</font>

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,240
I set a new task to do with writing love

59
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,610
letters and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's to find out whether or</font>

60
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,280
not the love<font color="#E5E5E5"> letter is a dying art and</font>

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,590
the young people today gets so much

62
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,750
negative press about being<font color="#CCCCCC"> a literate</font>

63
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,060
and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology is corrupting them</font>

64
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,400
but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know traditional</font>

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,590
letters and new media can actually

66
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,990
combine into something quite special so

67
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to say anything else</font>

68
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,830
except check out the link<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you see</font>

69
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,110
on the screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now and i hope you</font>

70
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,420

71
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,400
videos and commenting and telling all

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,840

73
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,209
