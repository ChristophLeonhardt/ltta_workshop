Our chimes go off at 9 oâ€™clock 
every day,
9 a.m. and 9 p.m. to commemorate
the Emanuel nine.
So I think a lot of times 
people will look
and begin to say well surely
maybe after year two
they should be fine, year three 
they should be fine.
It's going to take some time.
You don't want to forget.
Early on even when I was
assigned here,
several people wanted
to remodel down here
to just kind of change
the scenery so to speak.
When you begin to think about
mass casualty,
when you begin to think about
murdering
taking place in a sacred place,
I think in actuality
what happens is each day
you find new strength.
