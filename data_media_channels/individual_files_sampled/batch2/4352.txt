of administration policy of separating children from parents who illegally crossed the border it's now facing opposition from some Republicans here's Oklahoma Senator James Lankford addressing the issue in a call to a constituent what I'm making a request to the end of it to the White House on these keep families together as much as we can possibly keep families together for as long as we can possibly keep them together well House Speaker Paul Ryan said today that he wanted the issue addressed through legislation we don't want kids to be separated from their parents I think I just made that really clear an nbc's reporting to Texas Senator John microrna is planning on introducing a bill that will require that families be kept together while they are waiting for court proceedings and today Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Bible provides a justification for his policy let's watch by the laws of the government because God is obtained ordain the government for his purposes our policies that can result in short-term separation of families is not unusual or unjustified well here's how White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded it is very biblical to enforce the law that is actually repeated a number of times throughout the Bible but the separation of a legal family alien families is the product of the same legal loopholes that Democrats refuse to close and these laws are the same that have been on the books for over a decade and the president is simply enforcing them however there's no law that states that families must be separated the border it's happening now because it's a policy that the Trump administration initiated I'm joined now by MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff who's been given access to the country's largest facility for those children in Brownsville Texas he described the facility a former Walmart as lucky more like incarceration than temporary shelter let's let's go to you sir and my question to you is what's it like Jacob what's it like inside there it's uh it's pretty chilling to go in there Chris I mean again they call it a shelter but it feels more like a jail or a prison and to hear the Attorney General say it's not an unusual situation to separate children from their parents for a short period of time I mean that's absolutely untrue it's completely unusual and it's never been done before in this capacity the reason and there are now thirty percent of the kids inside that facility behind me the old Walmart thirty percent of the fifteen hundred kids in there that have been separated from their families is because of a brand new Trump administration policy to separate a prosecutor I should say 100 percent of the people that entered the country illegally and that results in the separation the only reason there's an overcrowding crisis inside there and now in Tornillo the port of entry near El Paso they're setting up a tent city which we're finding out just tonight is because there's not enough space because of this new policy and so it's completely disingenuous for the Attorney General to say that it's not new and same thing goes for the press secretary who stood up there today and said there's nothing new about what they're doing this is new to the Trump administration has never been done in this way before you know I've said this before check it but it has a sort of Sophie's Choice aspect to it you know from World War two and a holocaust I mean pulling the kids with what are the kids like when they want to see their mom what are they what are they do they do they ask to see can I see my mom and they in the guards say no you can't is that what it's like just wanting kids want to see their parents the reality is there is no seeing your mom or your dad or your family members when you're inside here you have the opportunity to call your sponsor if you are an unaccompanied minor and you showed up here without your parents but if your parents were separated from you at the border your parents are in federal prison right now and the only way to get in touch with them is to have that federal penal institution get your parents on the phone schedule a time to talk to you and you don't know when you're gonna see them again the average stay in here is 52 days and Chris again it's not unusual to have unaccompanied minors coming to the United States in 2014 and then 2016 we had big migrant crises where you had a lot of unaccompanied minors but this is a self-inflicted wound from the Trump administration a crisis created artificially by separating these kids down at the border creating the overcrowding situation crisis separations that we're seeing right now well Jeff sessions said today that your children and these facilities are treated well let's watch him this is HHS now Health and Human Services something entirely different from the criminal justice system to take care of these children in a good and decent proper way they're provided food and education in their native language health and dental care well it's hot down there isn't it Jacob it's hot and they're talking about its city now with with the people really living in the environment of Texas in this summer what the Attorney General said is not incorrect but it's not the issue the issue is not whether or not licensed child care professionals can give good quality care inside this facility to the children that are inside there is somebody from the ACLU told me you could send these kids to a five-star hotel and they'd still be traumatized for their entire life from being ripped away from their parents and he's just deflecting it's not about the quality of the care that's going on inside this facility even though it is child incarceration even though they are only allowed outside two hours a day and for the other 22 they're inside the Walmart again that is not new for what's going on inside facilities like this and the other 99 of them in 17 states throughout the country it is the fact that the Trump administration has chosen to put a large amount of kids more than ever before this place is as busy as it's ever been ever because the Trump administration has chosen as a deterrence strategy to scare people and not coming by saying we're gonna rip you apart from your kids we know that prevention through deterrence it was the official Border Patrol policy in the 90s all that did was result in more people crossing through more dangerous ways and dying in the desert or here in the brush in South Texas and that's what you're gonna see from a policy like this people going to stop declaring asylum and people gonna go into the country in more dangerous ways and then it'll become a true life-or-death humanitarian crisis Chris that's the next step in all this
