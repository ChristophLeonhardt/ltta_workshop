73
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,100
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they send that to you and in</font>

74
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,780
if you live in the States or any more

75
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,730
they do publish it do bikes I've really

76
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,890
read it she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great character really</font>

77
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,210
strong character and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font>

78
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,100
identifying with her at some points and

79
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,990
I now realize i really like the people

80
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">ranta and the characterization or more</font>

81
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,680
characters with us characterization of

82
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the characters there's something</font>

83
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">when he was about that the cut yeah the</font>

84
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,930
characterization in that book was just

85
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,820
it was really really strong at the

86
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,190
strongest as from this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

87
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,170
found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 13 is still blue envelopes</font>

88
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,300
as well but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> even more so even</font>

89
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,910
stronger and sweet scarlet so that was

90
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,130
