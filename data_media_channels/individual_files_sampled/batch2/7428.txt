all right so it is official Ayane Presley just Democrat is the winner and Capuano a good man a good progressive incumbent has lost and that's as I've been saying all night the exact situation you want you want to progressives run against each other in a very blue district in a very blue state so cop one had a good career a lot of great votes and then usually a leader for progressives not just the follower he had a very good career but Ayane Presley a dynamic uncorrupted justice Democrat came up and ran a fantastic campaign and has won that race so that's Massachusetts seventh District I Adam Presley's the winner just Democrats go 1 for 2 tonight only two candidates in Massachusetts and Ayane has one about the usual batting average or around 50% which for a group that's only been around for a year and a half is amazing and for a group that takes a lot of chances on people like Ocasio Cortez and Ayane Presley it's a fantastic average of sure that Politico will say Democrats lost one today no by the way they barely even talked about it they'd like you tagging our revolution because it's connected to Bernie Sanders they don't like to talk much about the just Democrats but sad day for them given how many victories there has been it's becoming a little unavoidable so before you even said that I looked at Politico to see what they're saying their headline is just Presley takes down incumbent Democrat wha no but they do have the first sentences the progressive left crowned its latest star Tuesday okay right so well I'll tell you Capilano does take corporate money yeah and a lot of it mm-hmm so and I'm looking right here at open secrets and he took from lawyers and law firms 18 grand from PACs 50 grand from real estate PACs 85 grand from a leadership PAC insurance PAC 62 grand transportation sixty-five thousand so he's taken PAC money in a proven so listen tonight is better yeah by definition ion is better I mean it's not an accident just Democrats endorsed her I think she's deeply progressive and uncorrupted that makes a giant difference now Capilano is a rare guy that they talk about in Washington and almost doesn't exist where he takes their money and votes against them I did that's like an old saying I've you're not a real politician if you can't take their money and drink their alcohol and vote against them who are you kidding nobody won't say yes right come on I actually did on many occasions to his great credit but nonetheless it is at least the appearance of corruption and that's exactly why they just Democrats don't take corporate PAC money that's why we got to get money out of politics cuz you don't even want to be thinking ok Capuano is great on the war and he was great on ice but is he secretly looking out for the real estate companies right so you don't want that lingering in your head so don't take corporate PAC money if you do you might lose especially in a blue district in a primary although now of course just Democrats our revolution have won in many many red districts as well so you better watch yourself so happy cap wanted real quick he most of his money came from large donors 51% of his money came from large donors 41% came from PACs small donors only 4% of his money kidding see that's another problem right because you lose your connection to the people where is for just Democrats so overwhelming majority their money oh well almost all of it comes from small donors some will can't cap out of 2,700 but most will be on a 200 overwhelming majority will be under $200 you know I think in the Ocasio cortes race she was at over 80% or so that was under $200 and Crowley was that either 1% or 2% there were none under the horsemen who are above 11% or small donor donations I mean think about look at that no but look at how about how stunning that is that none of the Democratic congressman I have more than 11% of their money from people making are giving them under $200 they've lost their connection to real Americans completely yeah and so that's why when progress is primary them now they're winning more and more and more and there's also momentum so you know Ocasio cortez is considered the start of that momentum to be fair to the other wonderful candidates that one earlier like car Eastman and so many others a mark component a company jar and and that now might take them 200 juniors seat etc that actually momentum and helped Acacio Cortez win Casa Cortez breaks through in a big way then Andrew Gilliam I think was a huge turning point I kill him is not a just Democrat Lisa but he's a solid progressive on their issues and and when Gilliam one is we were covering it last election live I predicted as John asked me to predict I said no finally the headlines are gonna turn around they're not going to be dismissive they're gonna say wow progressives have started a one win and that is what happened and now the next election primary election that we're covering here they are again even Politico with a positive headline because the momentum has swung and they could see what I did it is swing and keep this in mind for especially for the mainstream media in Washington they care about power if you have power they will bend to you now generally speaking their whole lifetimes that led over 20 years I've been covering politics money was power period period so they bent towards money and power on in a way that is really unfortunate but understandable now they're being to bend a little bit back in this direction and that's wonderful and tonight's gonna help a lot yeah I see a tweet from Elizabeth Warren Congrats to I Anna pressing her team for a hard-fought primary win Ayane and I have worked together for years and she's a fierce advocate and powerful force for change I'm looking forward to fighting alongside her in Congress pretty awesome yeah that's what victory looks like Huffington Post headline left stoner in Massachusetts yeah I don't know when they're gonna stop saying stunner stunner yeah you perhaps well is it a stunner either well no and it's great overall don't get me wrong it's wonderful it's good headline etc but you know that we have achieved success when it's no longer stunning you know and they're like another progressive wins of course right another uncorrupted candidate on the Left wins what else would happen and and at some point it might swing so much they start to be derisively right Studdard corporate Democrat wins what are the last ones remaining that let us whisper that tree Jimi shall we whisper the whispering has begun
