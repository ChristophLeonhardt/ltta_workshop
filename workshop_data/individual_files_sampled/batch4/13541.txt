on Monday the day before flying to Texas to demagogue at the funerals of Dallas cops killed by an anti white racist President Obama met with law enforcement leaders across the country at that meeting Obama threatened law enforcement with his usual mafioso tactic you know nice Police Department he got their shame if something happened to it good thing I'm around to protect you according to the Washington Post Obama said the attack on cops as a hate crime which is different than what he was saying last Sunday and then he said quote I'm your best hope Obama is a racial blackmailer he's an arsonist he ignites the flames and then he tells the cops only he can put out those flames if they just trust him and give him power this routine is actually nothing new from Obama back in 2009 when he met with top financial CEOs and essentially ordered them to cut their own salaries he said quote be careful how you make those statements gentlemen the public isn't buying that and then he continued my administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks and these tactics are despicable and they should be condemned by anybody of decent heart in mind President Obama called police officers around the country racist on Thursday morning hours before cops were shot by an anti white racist in Dallas then he claimed he had no idea why the shootings had happened in the first place and now he says they were hate crimes but that only he can heal the country and advocate for the cops this is scurrilous nastiness of the highest order and his grandstanding is gonna end there Obama right now as we're speaking he's gonna stands over the caskets of the officers and rip into cops here's a statement he put out this morning via the White House quote I reject the idea that these issues are somehow too big for us that America is too divided to find common ground as I've said I know that we can honor the incredible courage in service of our police officers and also recognize the racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system there's no contradiction there and if we are going to come together to solve those problems we have to understand that so we'll have to talk to each other we'll have to listen to each other and we'll have to see each other as equal parts of the American family so in other words the cops are still racist just these dead cops aren't racist and the only reason the dead cops aren't racist is because they're dead if they'd lived and we'd waited a week and they continued to arrest a quote/unquote disproportionate number of black people in other words arresting people responsible for crime regardless of race they'd still be part of the problem Obama isn't interested in fixing anything he's interested in setting fires and the whole is burning I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show tends to demonize people don't care about your feelings okay so because we're live we can't watch President Obama's speech which is sure to be a crap fest over at the at the funeral for these Dallas cops I said yesterday I think cops have every right to turn their backs on the president when he does this again hours before these cops were shot he was saying their systemic racism in the justice system you can't say things like I stand for cops also the system that they staff the system that they administer is systemically racist you can't do that you can't do that I mean that's like lamenting that that any institution is deeply racist and then saying yeah but if a few people from that institution died those people were heroes it doesn't it doesn't work that way and President Obama wants to play both sides of the table but first a piece of quick breaking news Bernie Sanders is now endorsed Hillary Clinton so we can watch a little bit of Bernie Sanders endorsing Hillary Clinton this is clip 23 I have known Hillary Clinton for 25 years we were a bit younger than I remember her is a great first lady who broke precedent in terms of the role that a first lady was supposed to play and as she helped lead the fight to universal health care I served with her in the US Senate and know her is a fierce advocate for the rights of our children okay we can stop it Bernie sold out Bernie sold out and I know her Bernie's done right I mean he's sold out so it turns out be the all principled socialist the man who could not be bought he was bought for basically a song by Hillary Clinton basically the way this went was Hillary went to him and she said what do I need to do to get you to endorse me he said I would like a pudding cup I love pudding but I don't know why there are so many types of pudding why that don't need to be that many flavors of pudding the world would be just fine if there were one flavor of pudding and the rich must pay for the pudding why am I here I don't know where I am take me back to a rubber room from whence I came also I may have pooped and it's so easy standing he's standing there endorsing the lady and I love all the Bernie Sanders supporters today saying well he fought the good fight he really fought the good fight now he's just getting in line and you know we're unifying behind Hillary okay he was like two weeks ago saying that Hillary Clinton was deeply corrupt because she was giving speeches for Goldman Sachs I don't know if you remember that I know maybe he has short-term memory loss but yeah you shouldn't okay he was ripping into her for being a corrupt harridan five seconds ago and now she's the greatest thing I have ever seen or at least that I can remember and I can only remember as far back as what I ate for breakfast this morning and it was Metamucil so vertebra Bernie Sanders endorsing Hillary Clinton that's big news demonstrating once again that nobody in politics has any principles including the so-called principled socialists I've ripped into Republicans for shifting the nature of the Republican Party to fit Donald Trump I will rip into Bernie Sanders and his idiot supporters for now moving over to the most corrupt woman in politics Hillary Clinton I love how he stood there and he said that she's going to fight for financial redistribution she's going to fight for a fairer world that doesn't benefit the top 1% but you're standing right there Bernie you understand she's like right next to you when you say this and that jacket she's wearing it's probably a thousand dollar jacket which she got wildly overcharged if that's how much that jacket cost she could just stolen it off the dead body of Violet Beauregarde from from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory I do not know why she's dressed like someone from the Chocolate Factory or why that must be chocolate factories putting small chocolate manufacturers out of business or why there is slavery for the orange Oompa Loompas I love those things I don't know what they do I only hope they have fruit cups okay so so but it's like there's too much Bernie Sanders it's our tribute to Bernie Sanders today because now he's he's faded off into the mists of time he's he's gone he's like Brigadoon he comes once every hundred years except bringing horror in his wake okay so back to the actual top story of the day so President Obama's descending on Dallas I want to pay tribute here to the actual hero of the Dallas story that is this Dallas police chief this guy is a stud he's great this Dallas police chief has been saying all the right things he he won't get politically involved he's standing up for his officers in a way that a lot of police chiefs don't political actors like Charlie Beck in LA he doesn't stand up for his officers the the fellow of Bill Bratton in New York he doesn't stand up for his officers this guy does so police chief David Brown he was asked about the protesters and here was his answer about the black lives matter protesters pretty spectacular that's too much to ask policing was never meant to solve all those problems and I just asked for other parts of our democracy along with the Free Press to help us serve your communities don't be a part of the problem we're hiring we're hiring get off that protest line and put application in and we'll put you in your neighborhood and hit we will help you resolve some of the problems you're protesting about and this is exactly right if you don't like how the cops are acting join the cops and do better do better but the left doesn't want to do that the left is not interested in doing that in fact what the left really is interested in doing is breaking down all bonds of social fabric what the left is really interested in doing is ending policing as it currently stands now here's the reality if usually want to solve the problem in the black community you need more police not less you don't need your police officers you need more police officers and the reason you need more police officers is because if you want your community to thrive if you want economic growth if you want educational opportunity you need people to live there who aren't afraid of being burglarized every two seconds we're not afraid to send their kids out on the street to play ball without a drug dealer approaching them you actually need rule of law you need rule of law and that means that you need people there enforcing the rule of law making the rule of law happen there's that study we mentioned yesterday from the New York Times have now had the chance to read through the study from from Harvard and basically what it found is that cops are less likely to shoot white people than black people by a factor about about 20% they're more likely to use increased levels of force including handcuffing and pushing people against walls on black people and the reason for that is Larry elders say black talk-show hosts and he's right about this and you can talk to cops about this when you're in a high crime area it's heavily minority when you're dealing with a suspect you are typically going to act to escalate the amount of force that you use that it doesn't gradually escalate you actually want to act with an overwhelming amount of force at the very beginning so that there's no misinterpretation that things are not going to gradually escalate we're not gonna argue about this I'm grabbing you I'm I'm the boss I'm the Alpha in this situation and so that happens a lot people refuse to acknowledge the realities the cops face on the street and so what the real agenda of the left is is to break down law and order and the idea is that you're not subject to the law if you're of a particular race I mean this is really the breakdown of America so the Marxist left just to do a quick bit of history here the Marxist left always believed that there would be class warfare and that class warfare would end up tearing down the existing capitalist system this explains why the Left hates the police so this is where I'm going with this the reason they left hate the police is that originally they thought okay well there are these these policing structures and they enforce the current law and the books and the current law on the books is capitalist law so we don't like the police but it turns out there hasn't been a class revolution it turns out that poor people are not interested in doing the Bernie Sanders thing and rushing Bill Gates's house and tearing his house apart but what the Left hit on was okay we don't have to use class groups we can use racial groups for this instead you can put race against race we can use natural tribalism to tear down the system so we'll put black people against white people we'll put black people against law enforcement and we'll suggest the entire system has to be torn down around our ears Samson like in order to achieve that the building of a new system and this is what you're about to hear so we're gonna play through a lot of the audio that you've been hearing from a lot of the major media figures on the left a lot of the black lives matter people the argument that they're basically making their new argument the one that they care about is that the police ought not to be involved at all in policing minority communities that's the in essence that's what they want when you ask what is black lives matter want they don't want anything except for less cops because when they say they want less black people in prison there's a very simple way to do that have less black people commit crimes it's the easiest way to have less black people in prison and when they say that they want less police brutality there's an easier way to do that and that is have less crime in your areas less confrontations with the cops less people who are going fewer people rather who are going to attack the cops and confront the and make sure that there are enough cops in the neighborhood cops have to act more aggressively when they're understaffed right firfer in in major cities there's at one cop for every 200-300 people that means the only reason that there's any sort of law and order at all is because people have a fear factor of the cops you staff up the cops you don't have to use those sorts of measures as much anymore but they don't want to do any of that what they really want to do is tear down the cops tear down the existing system say the entire system is racist it's why they don't target individual cops notice the left only target cop situations that are controversial are they only target cop situations that are controversial it's really interesting Walter Scott was shot black guy shot in South Carolina and this is a headline for like a day and a half there's a headline for like a day and a half why because people like me we looked in we said this is bad right that's a bad shoot put that guy in jail put that cop in jail we all agreed there was evidence it was a bad shoot the left doesn't like those cases the left falsely wants to generate racial controversy so that they can claim that people like you people like me we don't care about black people and that's because we're victims were part of the systemically racist system and that entire system has to be torn down in order to build a new reality that's the agendas they set up these false racial conflagrations when we all agree racism is bad we all agree brutality is bad they set up these false racial situations these false racial confrontations where there really are two sides of the story at the beginning and then later usually turns out there's one side and it's not the side they want they pick those situations to to focus in on because they need the controversy because the controversy allows them to label the entire system racist because if they if they were to pick the ones where that are non-controversial it proves the system isn't racist right Walter Scott proved the system was not racist we all condemned the shooter in Walter Scott the police officer and Walter Scott instead they'll pick Michael Brown because then when we say no we need more evidence they say I you're racist you're a racist that's that's what they're looking for okay so Marc Lamont Hill is a professor at Morehouse University historically black college he's also a CNN contributor listen to what Mark Lamont Hill had to say about black people and racism there's an amazing statement what you're about to hear wow there's so many things to say that first of all and by the way black lives matter in the movement for black lives this morning issued a pledge which I actually tweeted out today calling for justice calling for peace and calling for a togetherness at a moment were attempting to be divided so I think it's really important that say that the black lives matter movement is racist is business are to me not just because black people don't have the institutional power to be raised to search and employ racism but because the movement is called for justice it's called for demilitarization it's called for non-violence and because a few people entered that space and kind of colonize in space and do something other than what the movement is about doesn't mean the movement is wrong in the same way that Tea Party movement called for fiscal responsibility but they're a racist at the rallies I've been through some tea party rather racist there but I wouldn't say the Tea Party is a racist movement as such I would say that there are people we can go invade it and divert the movement and I've actually agreed with the basic premise that you can't slur the entire black lives matter movement with violence and some of the members that I've said this on on this show but you'll notice he slides in the line there and it just every sort glosses over it he slides in a line there where he says blacks are incapable of racism because they don't have power this is an insidious insidious perspective the idea is that you can only be labeled a racist if you have power now number one obviously black people in America have an enormous amount of power the presidents of the United States is black the Attorney General of the United States is black right this idea aside the chief law enforcement officer of the United States and the commander in chief are both black so the idea that blacks are completely deprived of power in the inner cities and like Baltimore the majority the police force is black the City Council's black a mayor is black the police chiefs black the DA is black right so this idea that black people don't have power number one is not true but number two the idea that the color of your skin determines one the amount of power that you have in American society and two that you are incapable of racism this sets up a moral double standard that is impossible to overcome I'll explain more about that if you go and you subscribe right now daily wire we're at we're out of time we're under fifteen minute limit go to daily wire calm you can check out the rest of the show you can download it at iTunes or SoundCloud as well and there's plenty more to talk about because we're gonna go through all of the leftist perspectives on Dallas and why would they're really arguing for is the wholesale collapse of policing in the inner cities and really of Western society as a whole because it's predicated on notions the left doesn't alike we'll talk about all of that and and stuff that I stuff that I like and stuff that I hate is gonna be pretty epic today so you're gonna want to stick around for that okay so before I go any further I have to mention our friends at ring comm so I have gotten a free ring device from people at ranked on this is the coolest device ever so basically the way that this works is you stick this near your door and it it shows you the home entrance with a wide angled HD video and it has a motion detector so it immediately lights up as soon as somebody approaches he can see who's at your front door and then it shoots the video to your phone to your computer so you don't even have to be home to tell who's at your front door and who's messing around around your house right for me that's great because I tend to be paranoid about home security because of what I do for a living my wife tends to be paranoid about home security because she's paranoid about home security ring comm is fantastic and the ring is really great so good that I actually went and on my own volition bots not like I get stuff for free from them because they advertise with us I actually went I bought another device because I think they do such a good job there's a home burglary here in the United States every 13 seconds and most happened in broad daylight and there's usually a door knock usually somebody knocks on the door to see if somebody's home and then they break in that's that's usually how these things happen the video doorbell stops burglaries before they happen because you can see and speak to anyone approaching your front door so they don't have to know that you're not home right they approach your phone rings you pick up and you say hey yeah what are you doing at the front door and then they say okay well the house is occupied I'm not going to go in there and robbed it so the kit they have this thing called the ring of security kit that they're selling now it's a ring video doorbell for the front door and a ring stick up cam and the wireless weatherproof HD camera to keep an eye on other parts of your property as well and so as I say it's already helping me it's already helping my family I think you should grab one of these too if you want the lowest price anywhere you go to ring.com slash Bend that's ring.com slash pen and join the hundreds of thousands of people including me who now protect their home with the ring and if you go there by the way you get fifty dollars off so ring com slash man that's a pretty good deal because it isn't that expensive to start ring com slash gun okay so you've got mark Lamont Hill saying black people are incapable of racism they're just not capable of racism what the left is doing here is they are mashing up the two things I talked about a Marxist view of the universe and a racial view of the universe right they're mashing the two up so Marxism is all about the idea that there's the powerful in society and the powerless and the power lists are incapable of sin it's only the powerful who are capable of sin because they're the ones who are who are in power right and so we have to overthrow them in order to come to this beautiful in the universe where everyone shares the power equally and they were actually met up with the race issues so they're saying the powerless are the black people the black people therefore are incapable of sin they're incapable of racism and so we can never accuse them of being racist we can never hold them to an equal standard now this is really nefarious the fact is the polls show that a plurality of black people think blacks are the most racist group in America a plurality of black people more black people think that blacks are a majority racist group then think the white people are majority racist group in the United States a Rasmussen poll from 2013 so the idea that black people can't be racist that look it's obviously untrue we just had a black racist murder six five cops and in Dallas and moon and other and wound another Sun and wind another six right so the idea that there are no black racist people is insane but this is a way of avoiding the argument entirely now we don't have to argue on similar terms this is identity politics at its finest because I hold the principle racism is bad you hold the principle racism is bad but you will not condemn it depending on who does it I'll say that it's racist when when Donald Trump who's supposedly on my side of the aisle he's really not but he supposedly is when he says Mexican judges are incapable of judging cases I'll say that's racist but you're saying Marc Lamont Hill then when somebody's on your side there's a black guy on your side he's incapable of racism because black people don't hold power that's such a nasty point of view sin affects all of us equally we're all equally capable of sin the poor and the rich everyone is equally capable of sin the minute you say people are not capable of sin because of the amount of power that they wield in a society or more or even worse because of the color of their skin that we can't hold people accountable for their individual sins this is how you end up with evil really thriving really thriving in a major way because now you're standing up for the group over the individual you're now standing up for color of skin over individual responsibility that's nasty stuff I mean that's honestly like you take that to its logical extreme and that's Aryan people are incapable of committing sins it's the underclass that's committing all the sins and so if Aryan people kill people in the underclass they killed in the subhumans then that's okay because Aryans are Aryans and they're not Kant that they don't hold the real power the Jews hold the real power right and this is that's you get in a really nasty Terrence the minute you say that one particular group is not capable of a sin because of who they are not because of what they do really really ugly stuff but all of this as I say is cover for another agenda so Melina Abdullah who is apparently one of my favorite people she said I'm a member of the KKK which is weird to me because last I checked ain't big on the Jews but Melina Abdullah she a professor at Cal State LA she was one of the people who was ginning up all of the riots when I when I was there and then she and her her University were talking about how I never should've been allowed to come Melina Abdullah was was on the TVs and she was talking about the police and listen to how she talked about the cops last week four black men were killed at the hands of the police we know about alton sterling and falando castile because we have really good video but there was also a murder in new york there was another murder in houston all in the span of one week so the black community is been is and has been under the assault under kind of the occupation of police who were operating as an occupying force rather than a force that is supposed to protect and serve all of the people okay so it's an occupying force now it's an occupying force as opposed they're actually police in crime now if you talk to law abiding members of the black community they'll tell you we need more cops here we need more cops here but it's an occupying force and you know that sort of language is dangerous because once you start saying that somebody's an occupying force this is the same sort of language Palestinians used about Jews they're occupiers the only way to expel the occupiers if it comes to violence then it comes to violence means it's really dicing language that she's using here and she went when she said it what's amazing you'll notice she says that four black men were killed by the cops last week right for buck you only heard to write the two of the one that our national flag oka steel shooting in Minnesota and the Alton sterling shooting in Louisiana by the way they're now claiming the Alton sterling shooting that hit the butt of his gun was visible outside his pocket he was reaching for it so that may have been a good shoot falando Castillo we still don't know the circumstances we just saw the aftermath but she says four were killed you I'm heard of the other two why haven't you heard of the other two because my understanding is and the other two these people in one case a guy broke into the house of a cop and cops shot him and in the other case the guy pulled the gun on a cop and the cop shot him but she's lumping this all together so anytime of person gets killed by the cops again this is the same ideology as Marc Lamont Hill black people can't be sinning because they're powerless and it can't be that there are confronting cops and doing bad things they can't be committing crimes cuz they're powerless and once you've exempted people from the normal rules of human society and behavior you shouldn't be surprised when people don't abide by the rules of normal human society and behavior you're holding one side to account but you're telling the other side and when I'm talking about cops and criminals here you're telling the cops that they have to be held to a standard that doesn't exist anywhere on the planet right a standard that not even of evidence a standard of feelings and you're telling the other side criminals who happen to be of minority descent that if you're of minority descent you're a criminal you're not actually a criminal so you know this continues along these lines Jessica DISA is a black lives matter activist and she takes this to its logical conclusion here's here's this black lives matter activist he was on Fox News last night talking about black lives matter our young people are hopeless in America are you gonna hope it's because you have all these adults here who are not listening in to our young people to talk about black on black crime in Chicago from Chicago Mike organizing the activism has been on Israel community control community vias we understand like what she was talking about but right we've got the point what I'm trying to say is here let him finish life we need to abolish the police period in the police disarm the police and we need to come up with community solutions for transformative justice what we are seeing with all these cases what we are seeing we can can we all agree that a loss of a life is tragic can we all agree on that temp 1010 we all might agree yes I've been peaceful since I've been here but I need to speak because I came in from Chicago to speak right and so we all can agree to the loss of a life Australia we all can agree that's the excessive force and extra deuce you extra judicial killings by law enforcement needs to be stopped people black white who's gonna protect the community if we abolish the police we need to come up with community solutions the police the police force in this country began as slave patrol okay the police force in this country began as slave patrol no the police force in this country existed in places where there were no slaves existed in the north there were bad police forces obviously there were of course bad police forces one of the things that the southerners did and Democrats Southern Democrats did is they basically expelled federal officers from the southern land after the Civil War even though there was an attempt that there were a bunch of black Congress people by the way who were elected to Congress it right in the aftermath of the Civil War and then all those reverses were there a bunch of racial reverses thanks to the Democrats that she presumably votes for but in any case you know she's saying abolish the police there is no policy geared toward killing black people faster than abolishing the police and this is this is the thing about the left and the right give everybody I'm coming to the point in my life where I'm starting to feel like let's just give everybody what they wish for let's just give everybody what they wish for the thing is that I don't want to see people kill so I don't want to give her what she wishes for but let's do a thought experiment for a second what I wish for is a law enforcement community that is empowered to stop crime and the laws that are on the books are only about people hurting each other that's my that's that's my basic view of how law enforcement and and community should work right if you're the left is abolish the police okay so let's say we do that you think crime is gonna go up er is it gonna go down and if it doesn't and by the way the reason that you have gang warfare is because there is a form of law but it's the law of the street alright if somebody kills somebody from your gang somebody from your gang goes and kills somebody from their getting there's a law of the street that applies there are places in the world where there's no effective police force go look at places in Mexico and there places in Mexico where there's no effective police force and the death rate is extraordinarily high higher than it is in places in Afghanistan what she once says when she says abolish the police that is the logical extension abolish civil society so we can create a new society a community society and what's gonna happen when they create this community society somebody's gonna have to be in charge there's gonna be a new police force but it's gonna be run by her alright that's what we're talking about because somehow somebody's gonna have to ensure that there's some semblance of law and order and this kind of bizarre view that we're all gonna get together in a room and decide to be nice to each other that's not how life works but this is what they want they want to tear down Society so the ideal is get rid of the police get rid of the law push all those people out blame the cops say the black people aren't subject to the same rules of morality as other people is Marc Lamont Hill apparently says and then we'll create a new society that new society will be a communal society it'll be a Bernie Sanders communal society where we all decide on the police force except in the end communal societies always end up devolve into Stalin at the top representing the quote unquote community and killing everybody who dissents that's that's how these things always end up because somebody's always in control and so if it's not if the people in control aren't subject to law if it's just subject to the whims of the quote unquote community you got a problem on your hands so you know the this this sort of stuff is becoming common unfortunately this sort of rhetoric and and in their and their fuse eleven recognize basic reality so on CN n there was a panel and one of the members of the panel was asked about whether black people are prone to criminality black people are not prone to criminality because of quote-unquote race okay it's not black people any more than white people are Hispanic people the color of your skin doesn't determine your criminality it is statistically true that blacks in America commit a disproportionate share of crime doesn't mean the individual black person is more prone to criminality than the individual white person of course but what it does mean is that statistically speaking statistically speaking blacks as a share of the population commits multiple times more crime than whites do than Hispanics do certainly than Asians do and so that was basically what was said on CNN but again you're not allowed to say to her things on mainstream television there is considerable evidence of racism in Ferguson so it isn't true that there was no evidence in tracing their racist emails versus phone calls racist practices he's saying in this that's exactly what I'm gonna say okay these this is a conversation that is not always easy to have you're going to have clashes of perspective but we all know this all right if you do not have this conversation the right way you do not move forward you can hi Rick ridiculous dr. oz routine okay so so what the guy says first of all he as I said black people are not prone to criminality but he's but that's mark Lamont Hill throwing that line on this guy right it's not you're not saying black people are prone to criminality when you say statistically speaking blacks committee disproportionate share of crimes what you're saying is that blacks commit a disproportionate share of crimes and that there can be multiple factors for that I don't think one of those factors of skin color because I don't think skin color magically makes people better or worse as mark Lamont Hill does mark Lamont Hill thinks black skin color makes you a better person because you can't be capable of racism then it continues along in Michael Eric Dyson is a professor at Georgetown it's amazing you have to be a professor at a major university to be as stupid as some of these people Michael Eric Dyson is on CNN and he says that Obama is going to visit Dallas to speak he's doing it probably right now speaking about the cops and here's what he says about Barack Obama visiting well I would have preferred him go to Louisiana then on to Minnesota then end in Dallas because he could truly bring as Professor Brinkley talked about it healing to the nation he's got to acknowledge the lethal and ferocious assault upon that Police Department there in Dallas and he's got to acknowledge the lethal and ferocious assault upon black men's and women's lives in America and he's got to acknowledge both at the same time and in Syria stop right there notice the moral equivalence that Michael Eric Dyson is drawing they're the lethal and ferocious assault on the police force is the same as the lethal and ferocious assault on black people in Dallas a black man who hated white cops went with purpose malice aforethought and shot and murdered parents of children women men cops shot them killed them knowing what he was doing they didn't do anything he is now ik waiting these shootings of black people in the United States by the cops with that sort of purposeful malice aforethought okay that's insane that's insane this is a country of 40 million black people four zero million black people you know many quote-unquote unarmed black people were shot in the United States last year 36 36 and a huge number of those were people who attacked cops and tried to take guns off to cops or it or resisted arrest I mean or did something dangerous the number of unarmed black people who are wrongfully shot in the United States is in single digits and he's equated that he's equated that to these people going out and this guy going on in shooting cops purposefully you're ascribing that sort of KKK racism to the cops and then you expect the cops to police communities and do their jobs you expect this country to hold together when you're accusing its law enforcement community of this nonsense and this sort of stuff is really despicable really despicable but again when you are when you're brought up in the notion that American society is inherently racist when you believe Barack Obama's sick routine the DNN is part of that racism is part of our DNA not that racism is part of history and we've fought hard to overcome it but that it's part of our DNA it's unalterable we can't change it in any real way and that it's systemic that it's deep rooted and deep-seated and it's not going away right we've gotten better but we're not but we always have ten percent more to go when you believe that you end up in this perverse situation where the only real solution if you believe that the only real solution is the solution to dis man the cops right if the police are the KKK the only solution is to disband the police you end up back where that where the crazy lady said we should end up right no cops anywhere and that again does not help black people and all other solutions have been ruled off the table by the left so Whoopi Goldberg with her with her incredible level of personal genius Whoopi Goldberg was talking yesterday about raising children so one of the things people say is one of the reasons for a disproportionate crime rate in the black community is because they're single they're similar mothers in the black community who are incapable of raising young boys because there's no father's in the black community because there is a culture that sustains education in parts of the black community because there's a culture of gang violence and crime that people grow up in there's a culture of government dependency that it's very difficult to overcome and so Whoopi Goldberg says you know we can't talk about any of those things we only have to do the real reason that for disparity in America must be racism it can't be any of these other factors that by the way appiy apply exactly the same to white people grow up in single mother homes and are parts of gangs they're poor white people in America too lots of them more poor white people in America than poor black people in America by long shot actually but Whoopi Goldberg says we can't talk about any of those other issues or guess what you're a racist here we go don't tell us how to raise our so telling us particularly black folks and particularly black parents that we need to teach our children better because they're they're probably going to be killed by each other is not the way to do this because we already know what we need to say to our children this has been going on a very long time but it doesn't help if you stir the pot Rudy well he's not the only one no I these are the only water but but but he's the one I'm talking to you now yeah along with mr. Bratton you know to tell us to take a page on the n-double a n-double-a-cp s playbook is kind of its kind of not the thing you want to say I would say you first none of the people who were shot not the police officers not the people who were shot over the weekend none of them were disrespecting the police so telling us to be nicer to be quieter is not gonna work you first I say be respectful understand what people are upset okay don't be nicer to the cops isn't gonna work it isn't alton sterling physically resisted the cops in louisiana that's on the tape right the idea that and the idea that if you don't want to I don't understand why this is even mildly controversial if you don't want run-ins with cops be in a place where there are less crimes this is just basic common sense but the idea that we can't tell again that only when they say they want a conversation the left when the when the racial Left says they want a conversation what they really want is a monologue they want to yell at you and they want their feelings legitimized when I talk to my wife we'll have conversations where she's upset sometimes and we have a rule in these conversations which by the way you should apply to your relationships and marriages it's a very useful rule men have a tendency to listen to what their wives are saying and then say okay let's solve the problem because men by nature tend to be problem solvers let me grab a hammer and drive a nail like let me let me do something to fix this so women sometimes just want to moan about what's going on in their lives so we have a rule and the rule is that before each conversation that starts like this where she's gonna complain about something I say okay sweetheart do you want to just complain about this or do you want me to like try and fix it because if I try to fix it then sometimes you get upset right because you just want me to hear what you're saying just let me hear your feelings what we're talking about racially I think one of the biggest disconnects here is that the left pretend that they want solutions and they don't they just want to complain about the problem because they gain votes and they gain credibility and it's not politically dangerous to talk about solutions talking about solutions is politically dangerous because those solutions are almost always politically unpalatable solutions like get me before you have children solutions like raise your children not to join gangs and become involved in criminal activity solutions like there need to be more cops in your community not fewer cops in your community to enforce the law solutions like your community has to cooperate with the cops to turn in criminals rather than protecting criminals because they happen to be members of your family or people that you know right these are actual solutions that would solve the problem but those solutions are all politically unpalatable so instead what you'll get is politicians and commentators and everybody just saying all the feelings have to be looked at all the feelings have to be just spilled out onto the table and say okay well but those feelings are actually an obstacle to the solution because not all feelings are justified because when you say that you hate the cops or when you say that the cops are all racists you're actually creating an obstacle now because if you say all cops are racist and I say the solution is more cops in your community and you don't have any evidence to say the racist you just feel that way we can't come to a conclusion because according to you I'm now saying there should be more racists in your community not all feelings are justified do you want a solution or you want to bitch about the problem do you want a solution or do you want to or do you want to just complain do you want to just talk about how America's racist and I have a feeling that most people in America who are part of this debate just want to talk about how America's racist or gain moral credibility points like Newt Gingrich and Marco Rubio for saying America's racist who now they understand the black man in America because they've said that well it's not a matter of black and white is a matter of right and wrong now why is it that that criminality excessive force wrong killings why shouldn't we have the same standard for everybody on this stuff and the answer is because the left doesn't want the same standard for everybody they're using race as a club to tear down the system they couldn't use class and now they're gonna use race as a club to tear down the system that's what Mark Lamont Hill is doing that's what Molina abdul is doing that's what Michael Eric Dyson is doing that's what Whoopi Goldberg is doing even though she doesn't she's not smart enough to acknowledge that's what she's doing that's what she's doing okay so meanwhile there's still a presidential race on there's a new poll out today and Republicans are all hot and bothered over to this thing they're saying that it's amazing look at this Donald Trump is only down three points there's another way to read that poll okay in the last four weeks we have had the biggest single terror attack since 9/11 on American soil we've had an anti cop massacre in Dallas - which Hillary Clinton responded wrongly we've had brexit right the British leaving the EU and we've had Hillary Clinton being specifically called out for criminal conduct by the FBI and Donald Trump is still down free could you possibly have a better news cycle for Donald Trump and he's still down three and I know you people expect gang I don't know what if you expect him to just leap to the moon at some point but when all of the all of the factual scenarios tend when the news cycle tends to break politically in your favor forget about good or bad a lot of terrible things are happening obviously when the news cycle breaks in your favor and you can't make real way out of it when your deficit goes from six points to three Mitt Romney would been up at ten by this point ten and not for a ten it would be a disaster for the Democrats by this point but it isn't because we have an incompetent candidate that said it's time for a little bit you know we haven't done it in a few days because all the news have been very serious but it's time for a little bit of good Trump bad Trump so we'll start with good Trump so Donald Trump on this particular police issue has actually been quite good he's been very very good on this issue as good as Donald Trump is capable of being without hurting his brain so Donald Trump was talking about law and order he says I'm the law and order candidate by the way I've been saying I personally have been saying for literally years that if Republicans want to win in blue states they need to start talking about crime Rudy Giuliani is mayor of New York City because of crime Richard Riordan was mayor of Los Angeles because of crime rates Ronald Reagan in 1980 people ignore this one of the reasons he became president was to fight national crime so Trump is doing that now smart so here is Donald Trump talking about how he's the law and order candidate I am the law and order candidate Hilary Clinton on the other hand is weak ineffective pandering and as proven by her recent email scandal which was an embarrassment not only to her but to the entire nation as a whole she's either a liar or grossly incompetent one or the other very simple okay why wasn't you doing this for two weeks why was he talking about like weird Jewish star memes and and all the other nonsense he's been talking about but this is good Trump so that if Trump did this all the way to the convention he'd be in solid shape he'd be in good shape and Trump continues along these lines he says look every kid in America should be able to securely excuse me walk the streets and this is exactly right every kid in America should be able to securely walk the streets in their own neighborhood without harm everyone will be protected equally and treated justly without prejudice we will be tough we will be smart we will be fair and we will protect all Americans okay that's good stuff that's good stuff and Hillary Clinton doesn't say that stuffs just as white people need to be more considerate why Pia is so black guy shoots eleven cops and the problem is white people obviously clearly and then it was time for a little bit of you guessed it bad Trump because it's a day ending and why so here's Donald Trump explaining what he's gonna do at the Republican National Convention and that is he's going to be Donald Trump the big question is with the Republican National Convention coming up you may use a teleprompter or not and I don't know if it's ever been done without essentially a teleprompter it's not a game-time decision no I would say I'll make a decision at some time maybe a week before but I'd love to do it actually without a teleprompter oh boy and Donald Trump without a teleprompter at the Republican National Convention I mean why doesn't he just pour gasoline on himself and set himself on fire right now like just finish it I mean this is like this is that is crazy talk that's crazy talk so you wonder why people are a little nervous about Donald Trump and they're right there that's the reason people are a little nervous about Donald Trump okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that we're doing surprise endings this week so because I'm hoping for a surprise ending at the convention but I'm going to be sadly disappointed so surprise ending this week so Planet of the Apes everybody knows the surprise ending at the end of Planet of the Apes the original Planet of the Apes if you don't it's because you're culturally illiterate but all assume you are for purposes of this particular this particular segment planet they've section a really good movie the original written by Rod Serling the guy behind Twilight Zone the concept is great the script is terrific the music is phenomenal Jerry Goldsmith wrote the score to this film and he wrote it in Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone style the way the twelve-tone works basically is that if you use their 12 tones in a scale including the half steps if you use any tone in the 12 tones you now have to use the other 11 before you can go back to the original tone right this entire score is written in Schaumburg twelve-tone style and it gives it a really weird creepy feel the score is brilliant it's brilliant and then the movie itself is really compelling and it's a very it's a very good movie and the ending is of course but I mean the first time I saw this I was probably I don't know eight or nine the first time I saw this I was just jaw on the floor the ending to this film okay so here's the the preview for those who have never seen the original Planet of the Apes says what you're about to see is from the year's most unusual and important motion picture may send a novel by the author of bridge on the river by discover Planet of the Apes civilization where humans run wild in the jungles and the superior beings are deep doing snap it there this movies this movie as creepy as all hell it's a super creepy movie and then the and again the script is terrific and the music is fantastic it mean if you're losing the music and getting creeped out that's because it's it's a really good score okay time for some things that I hate so naturally we're now back in the cycle where celebrities decide that they have to get involved in politics so you've got WNBA players and apparently they don blacklivesmatter shirts at one of their games first of all I'm not sure how anybody knew about that I don't know who goes to WNBA games I mean I thought they were probably the only people there it was like them their immediate families but apparently there were some cops there and the cops walked out which they should because this slander of black lives matter is the implication the implication so stupid it's a dumb conversation people say black lives matter isn't racist okay it's not racist to just say black lives matter because black lives matter brown lives matter white lives matter duh what's racist is the implication that there are a bunch of people out here like me who think black lives don't matter of course black lives matter there's like saying that there's no sky is blue movement there's no white lives matter movement right but for the same reason if we've been a shirt that said babies lives matter the pro-choice movement would fully understand that we're ripping on abortion when you say black lives matter what they're saying really is the cops don't think black lives matter that's really what they're saying there and so the cops walked out and it's just I don't understand why every aspect of American life has to be filled with politics and this is coming from somebody who's obsessed with politics okay finally last thing I hate for the day so this this this idiot fourteen-year-old kid and this kid is you know there's this whole group of people on the left to indoctrinate their children and then celebrate when their kids preach back to them all the things that they've taught to them so there's this 14 year old kid named Royce man he participated in a poetry slam at his private school in Atlanta Georgia first of all to private school so I'm gonna go with ain't exactly impoverished he participates in a poetry slam second indicator it's not exactly impoverished a poetry slam also indicated the school is doing a terrible job no one should ever be involved in a poetry slam that should never happen for any reason poetry slams created by the devil and should never be it should never be allowed into the public square it's like it's like BDSM you undo it on your own time enjoy yourself but don't please don't bring into public okay so Royce man's 14 year old and he just trots out this routine about white privilege and of course he gets cheered for this right the way the white kid gets cheered for saying that he's privileged that's the way this works so if you just go out there say oh yes everything that has happened in my life is because I'm white all right whereas if you're actually a genius and you did something genius if you like invented a new product everybody would go that's nice but but you like if you actually invented a scientific breakthrough ever ago it's kind of cool but if you go out there and you say well you know I'm privileged and I know because I'm a child and children have all the wisdom of the earth that kids are dumb I mean if kids were smart they'd around the world and if kids did around the world they'd all be bombing each other by age too I mean legitimately legitimately two-year-olds in a room with guns no one survives so there's a here's this fourteen-year-old kid there's this fourteen-year-old kid doing his white boy privilege poetry slam your women I'm sorry dear black people I'm sorry dear Asian Americans dear Native Americans dear immigrants who come here seeking a better life I'm sorry dear everyone who is in the middle or upper class white boy I'm sorry I have started life at the top of a ladder while you were born on the first rung I'd say now that I would change places with you in an instant but if given the opportunity would I probably not because to be honest being privileged is awesome I'm not saying that you would be on different rungs of the ladder is how I wanted to stay I'm not saying that any part of me is we liked it that way I'm just saying that love being privileged I'm not ready to give that away I love it because I can see it not one of you was attributing that to the fact that every one of my skin color has a dirty mouth I love it because I don't have to spend an hour every morning putting on makeup to meet other people's standards I love it because I don't worry about what kind of food is on my plate instead of whether or not there will be food on my plate I love it then he goes along these lines oh good okay let me explain something to you stupid 14 year old child everyone in life everyone is born in a different circumstance all the people are born in different circumstances yes some of those are better yes some of those are worse but if you don't have equal rules that apply to everyone it matters where you end up in life and what direction you're going not where you started if you think that where you started is where you end up then you're living in a tyranny if you think that where you started should not determine where you end up then you're in favor of freedom and you should get out of the way instead of just wandering around talking about how privilege is an unalterable but an unalterable lack approach is an unalterable burden that you have to that you can tell reconning you're stuck no matter if you're born without privilege then you're just stuck of course people are born with different privileges born to parents instead of one parent they're born rich instead of for the poor and smart instead of stupid like this happens that doesn't mean that the solution to that is to simply apologize for your privilege and then suggest that that privilege is unalterable and you're stuck where you are again that's part of the whole tear down the entire system routine because if you're stuck where you are that's unfair we have to tear down the entire system and by the way I don't rub you at the kid saying the f-word to the fact that he has that he's white I don't attribute black people saying the f-word to the fact that they're black I attribute people who are 14 years old saying the F words the fact that they have crappy parents that's what I attribute that to regardless who are sitting there just nodding along it's a how about again equal standards applied to everyone it doesn't mean we all finish up in the same place it doesn't even mean that we all have equal opportunity so to speak because the fact is that we don't I don't have an equal opportunity to play in the NBA number one I have no outside jump shot number two I can't exactly post up I'm five nine right so but that doesn't mean that the rules don't apply to everyone equally and what you make of those rules is up to you it's your job to make sure that you succeed in life it's it's the government's job to make sure that everyone else gets out of your way it's not the government's job to correct but Thomas soul calls cosmic imbalances is there's no quest for cosmic justice inherent in life and sitting there complaining about how you're born welcome to earth welcome to earth nobody nobody nobody begged to be born me none of us had a choice in that and nobody begs to die or very few people do we don't have a choice in that either what we do between those two points that's up to you in a free society and you should aim for the kind of society where that is up to you not the kind of society where your circumstances is changed by outside forces beyond your control or where you get to victimize your neighbor in order to change your own circumstance we'll talk more about that I'm sure we'll talk about President Obama's address he's speaking right now about the Dallas cops I'll give you the update on that tomorrow there's plenty more to talk about plus I think that we're gonna switch it around I think we're gonna do the mailbag on we'll keep doing the mailbag on Thursdays I think we'll do Bible verse on Wednesday so that we separate it a little bit so tomorrow we'll do some some Bible talk if that's if that's your thing I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
