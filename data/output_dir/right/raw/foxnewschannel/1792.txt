1
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:08,253
STEVE: WELCOME BACK EVERYONE.

2
00:00:08,253 --> 00:00:09,655
THAT TRACK, YOU MAY BE A I

3
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:10,756
BELIEVE TO DECIPHER IT.

4
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:13,925
ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

5
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:14,760
US V THEM.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,996
IT'S A SAMPLE OF IAN'S BOOK.

7
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:19,464
LET'S ASK HIM ABOUT IT.

8
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:21,433
IAN, I THINK OF YOU AS ONE OF

9
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,201
THE ULTIMATE GLOBALISTS.

10
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:25,170
HANGING AROUND WITH THOSE GLOBAL

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,571
ELITES THAT WE HEAR ABOUT ALL OF

12
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:27,105
THE TIME.

13
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:28,874
AND NOW YOU'RE TILLING US IT'S A

14
00:00:28,874 --> 00:00:29,241
DISASTER.

15
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:29,675
WHAT HAPPENED?

16
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:31,877
>> WELL, LOOK, I GREW UP IN THE

17
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:33,545
PROJECTS AND I CERTAINLY HAVE

18
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:36,348
BENEFITED ENORMOUSLY FROM THE

19
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:38,050
ETIOLOGY OF ELITES AROUND THE

20
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,818
WORLD SAYING IF WE JUST OPEN

21
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:42,254
BORDERS, IF WE HAVE FREE TRADE,

22
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:44,122
FREE MIGRATION, IF WE SEND OUR

23
00:00:44,122 --> 00:00:45,590
TROOPS ALL OVER THE WORLD TO

24
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,458
CREATE STABILITY, THAT'S GOING

25
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,027
TO BE GOOD FOR ALL OF US

26
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:50,729
IT'S GREAT FOR THE GLOBALISTS

27
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:51,763
SITTING AROUND THE TABLE.

28
00:00:51,763 --> 00:00:53,398
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE AVERAGE

29
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:54,700
AMERICAN OR THE AVERAGE

30
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,067
EUROPEAN.

31
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:56,335
AND FOR 40 YEARS NOW THEY'RE

32
00:00:56,335 --> 00:00:57,502
SAYING THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT IS

33
00:00:57,502 --> 00:01:00,405
LYING TO US, THE LEFT AND THE

34
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:00,706
RIGHT.

35
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:02,441
WHETHER IT'S THE CORPORATE

36
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,843
CEOs OR THE BANKERS OR

37
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:06,211
POLITICAL LEADERS, THAT IS WHY

38
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:08,180
YOU GOT DONALD TRUMP, IT'S WHY

39
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,482
YO GOT

40
00:01:10,482 --> 00:01:10,549
YOUGOT

41
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:10,582
YOU GT

42
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:11,717
YOU GOT BREXIT.

43
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:13,518
THE ONLY COUNTRY WHERE YOU DON'T

44
00:01:13,518 --> 00:01:14,920
SEE THIS AMONG THE WEALTHY

45
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,722
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD IS JAPAN,

46
00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:18,890
NO IMMIGRATION, THE POPULATION

47
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,492
IS SHRINKING, THE WORKING CLASS

48
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:21,993
IS DOING BETTER AND WHERE THEIR

49
00:01:21,993 --> 00:01:24,329
MILITARY IS CONSTITUTIONALLY

50
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:25,430
FORBIDDEN FROM FIGHTING

51
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:25,797
ANYWHERE.

52
00:01:25,797 --> 00:01:27,299
THAT'S

53
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:27,332
THEY'S

54
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:29,101
THEY'RE THE ONE COUNTRY THAT

55
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:29,968
REJECTED GLOBALISM.

56
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:31,370
AS MUCH AS I CAN SAY SITTING

57
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,672
HERE IN MANHATTAN THAT I'VE

58
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:34,773
BENEFITED, IT'S NOT OKAY FOR ME

59
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:36,975
TO SAY THAT GLOBALISM HAS

60
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:37,509
SUCCEEDED.

61
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:39,511
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S

62
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:41,446
HAPPENING AROUND THE DEVELOPED

63
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:43,582
WORLD AND RECOGNIZE THIS ISN'T

64
00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:43,982
WORKING.

65
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:45,050
STEVE: JUST TELL US WHAT ARE THE

66
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,718
KEY ELEMENTS.

67
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:48,220
WE THROW THESE PHRASINGS AROUND

68
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:48,954
ALL OF THE TIME.

69
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:52,524
WHAT ARE THE SIMPLE ELEMENTS OF

70
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:52,891
GLOBALISM.

71
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:53,492
>> THERE'S FOUR.

72
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:55,360
ONE IS THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE

73
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,262
FREE TRADE AND THAT'S GREAT FOR

74
00:01:57,262 --> 00:01:58,130
EVERYONE.

75
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,332
WHEN IN REALITY WE KNOW IF THE

76
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:01,967
GOVERNMENTS DON'T TAKE CARE OF

77
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:03,802
THE PEOPLE THAT LOSE THEIR JOBS,

78
00:02:03,802 --> 00:02:06,571
EVEN IF THE GOODS ARE CHEAPER,

79
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:08,607
THEY FEEL THEY GET SCREWED.

80
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:09,875
SECONDLY, OPEN BORDERS AND

81
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,443
PEOPLE GET IN AND WE'RE GOING TO

82
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:12,878
DO BETTER AS AN ECONOMY.

83
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:14,613
YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE AT

84
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:16,782
HOME, THEY'RE GOING THE SAY, WHY

85
00:02:16,782 --> 00:02:18,750
HAVE ARE YOU LETTING PEOPLE IN

86
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,152
WHEN I'VE BEEN IGNORED.

87
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:22,654
THIRD, WE HAVE A BIG MILITARY,

88
00:02:22,654 --> 00:02:23,155
ALLIES SUPPORT US.

89
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:26,658
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHETHER

90
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:29,361
IT'S AFGHANISTAN, SYRIA, IRAQ,

91
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:33,532
VIETNAM, WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE

92
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:33,899
STABILITY.

93
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:34,933
THEY FIGHT OVER THEIR FAILED

94
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,701
WARS, WITH

95
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:36,735
WARS, TITH

96
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:36,768
WARS, THEH

97
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,403
WARS, THEY COME BACK, VETERANS

98
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:39,104
ADMINISTRATION IS BROKEN.

99
00:02:39,104 --> 00:02:40,672
WHY ARE WE DOING IT.

100
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:41,940
AND THEN FINALLY THE TECHNOLOGY

101
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,176
IS GOING TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR

102
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:46,378
EVERYONE.

103
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:48,246
WE'RE DISPLACING JOBS FASTER

104
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:50,282
THAN WE HAVE THE GLOBALIZATION.

105
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:51,516
AND TECHNOLOGY IS RIPPING UP THE

106
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:54,419
FABRIC OF, YOU KNOW, ESTABLISHED

107
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:55,620
DEMOCRACIES, MAKING MONEY ON THE

108
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,155
BACK OF ADVERTISING COMPANIES

109
00:02:57,155 --> 00:03:00,392
LIKE FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE.

110
00:03:00,392 --> 00:03:02,060
SO ALL OF THESE FOUR DRIVERS

111
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,261
THAT HAVE LED US TO BELIEVE THAT

112
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:04,596
WE WERE GOING TO BE CLOSER AND

113
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:06,598
THAT OUR SOCIETIES WOULD ALL

114
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:09,201
SUPPORT A GLOBALIST PHILOSOPHY,

115
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:11,269
ONE WORLD, OPEN BORDERS, FREE

116
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:12,671
TRADE, ACTUALLY WORKS REALLY

117
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,906
WELL FOR A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF

118
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,308
PEOPLE IN THESE COUNTRIES.

119
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:18,009
AND THE AVERAGE PERSON SAYS, I'M

120
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:19,144
SICK OF IT.

121
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:21,012
I'M EITHER SO ANGRY THAT THE

122
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:22,547
SYSTEM IS SO RIGGED I'M NOT

123
00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:23,949
GOING TO VOTE AT ALL BECAUSE NO

124
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:25,584
ONE I VOTE FOR IS GOING TO

125
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:26,451
MATTER

126
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:29,221
OR I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR PEOPLE

127
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:31,156
THAT PROMISES TO BREAK STUFF

128
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:33,525
STEVE: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

129
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:35,227
>> I KNOW IAN.

130
00:03:35,227 --> 00:03:36,828
I READ HIS WORK EVERY MONDAY

131
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:38,363
WHEN HE PUTS OUT A NEWSLETTER

132
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:40,065
AND IT'S HELPED INFORM ME ABOUT

133
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:40,932
A LOT OF THINGS.

134
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:42,400
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

135
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,768
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUT

136
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:43,835
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOU-

137
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:43,869
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUI

138
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:44,269
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUM

139
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:44,302
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUU

140
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:44,336
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUE

141
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:44,369
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUD

142
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:44,402
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUT

143
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:44,669
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUO

144
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:44,703
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUA

145
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:44,736
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUK

146
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:44,769
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUN

147
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:44,803
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUG

148
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:44,836
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUT

149
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:45,403
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUE

150
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:45,871
QUESTIONS NOW.

151
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:51,042
BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

152
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,010
GLOBALIZATION AND GLOBALISM.

153
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,613
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE?

154
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:57,482
>> GLOBALIZATION WORKS, YOU OPEN

155
00:03:57,482 --> 00:03:59,017
THE BORDERS WITH, FREE TRADE,

156
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:01,686
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE GOODS ARE

157
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:03,021
ABLE TO MOVE EFFICIENTLY, THE

158
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:05,390
PRICE OF THE GOODS IS CHEAPER

159
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,691
AND THE LABOR MOVES TO THE

160
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:08,660
PLACES THAT ARE LESS EXPENSIVE.

161
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,961
THAT ABSOLUTELY WORKS.

162
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:11,096
FOR THE WORLD.

163
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:12,931
IT'S THE BEST ECONOMIC SYSTEM.

164
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:15,400
BUT IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF

165
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,601
THE PEOPLE AT HOME, BECAUSE

166
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:19,370
THERE ARE A LOT OF LOSERS FROM

167
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,471
GLOBALIZATION, EVEN IF IT'S THE

168
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:22,541
SYSTEM THAT LEADS TO THE MOST

169
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,442
GLOBAL GROWTH, EVEN IF OUR

170
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:26,011
SHAREHOLDER DO WELL, AMERICA

171
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:28,046
GROWTH AT THE TOP LEVEL IS GOOD,

172
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:30,415
THEN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN, WE'VE

173
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:32,651
HAD FLAT WAGES FOR WORKING CLASS

174
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:34,619
AMERICANS FOR 40 YEARS NOW.

175
00:04:34,619 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE 3.9% EMPLOYMENT.
