1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,319
I know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience and having talked</font>

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,389
to lots venture capitalists that the

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,440
word content is just a horrible concept

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,850
to venture<font color="#CCCCCC"> capitalists now and yet you</font>

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,289
have actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> built your portfolio</font>

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:17,820
around this so what's different what are

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,110
you seeing that others are missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,090
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's happened is that the</font>

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,450
west coast<font color="#E5E5E5"> venture capital community for</font>

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,980
the longest time didn't like content

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,080
because it takes too many people who

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,880
make too much money to produce the

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,090
content and there's a bias<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in</font>

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,649
the west coast in particular to machines

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,559
creating things and sure enough you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,149
Google came along and was this

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,230
incredible machine that created great

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,300
advertising inventory with essentially

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,760
no human intervention and as we know

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,379
Google is a great company<font color="#CCCCCC"> and went on to</font>

21
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:50,909
be a great story and everybody's been

22
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,600
chasing the next machine that can create

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,460
great advertising inventory but the fact

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,949
is that i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's an anomaly and that</font>

25
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,780
to create great advertising inventory

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,120
you need to create great content and

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,729
creating great content means great

28
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,000
people who you do have to pay who know

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,880
how to write and edit and design<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,030
build you know interactivity into the

31
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,830
content and so that we've always

32
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,540
believed that and that's the type of

33
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,520
content<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i think people want to</font>

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,050
consume I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of</font>

35
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,370
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> that advertisers want to be</font>

36
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,670
associated with and because the the

37
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,500
notion of having too many people around

38
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,380
I think that's what's driven venture

39
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,960
guys away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from content as a business and</font>

40
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,000
two of the areas that some venture

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,950
capitalists are excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

42
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,960
still under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rubric content but are</font>

43
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">very different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than what you're doing</font>

44
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,330
and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

45
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,940
in a minute are the completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

46
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,220

Wikipedia is there's a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> version</font>

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,660
of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so then there's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mick content</font>

49
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,390
the demand media associated content seed

50
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,520
where we're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to pay a million</font>

51
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,830
freelancers five dollars a post or

52
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,300
whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to create this massive</font>

53
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,730
body of work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be SEO through</font>

54
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,620
google and make gazillions of dollars at

55
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,000
the expense of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> New York Times right</font>

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,429
so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think those models work well I</font>

57
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,408
think demand you know demand is

58
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:12,960
basically is a google arbitrage you know

59
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,740
they create a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of content</font>

60
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,440
and it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> SE owed and then ninety</font>

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,270
percent of the revenue comes from the

62
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,740
links the google links that are on the

63
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,010
demand content so having 11 revenue

64
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,750
source is you know for ninety percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

65
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">your revenue is risky but i think i</font>

66
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a part of the equation</font>

67
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,650
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that having that Mick</font>

68
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,410
content to use your term it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

69
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,900
you know having but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think you have to</font>

70
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,440
layer on top of it professional branded

71
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,420
content that the advertising community

72
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,460
wants to be associated with because the

73
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,290
risk right from a brand's perspective is

74
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,120
that it gets involved with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these</font>

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">user-generated or Mick content and it's</font>

76
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,680
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be created</font>

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,870
next do you know it's it's not a safe

78
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">place for a brand manager or a media</font>

79
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,170
planner to associate so you think

80
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,150
advertisers will continue to care about

81
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,500
that because if you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a trade show</font>

82
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,810
now you'll have ID seven ad networks

83
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,910
tell you doesn't matter demand media

84
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">page doesn't match yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do I look I</font>

85
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,080
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> remnant inventory is always going</font>

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be best monetized to ad networks but</font>

87
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,770
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact of the matter is is that</font>

88
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,550
the majority of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mart the margin of</font>

89
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,480
advertising based businesses is going to

90
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,240
be through sold inventory to advertisers

91
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,640
and when my<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

92
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,030
advertisers or agencies the media

93
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,950
planners go on to the site and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they say</font>

94
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,960
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on that page and that page</font>

95
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that they point to the pages that</font>

96
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,310
they want to be on they care about

97
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,320
context they care brands take a long

98
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,760
time to build and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy</font>

99
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">things to destroy and so they don't want</font>

100
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,540
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that chance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I do think</font>

101
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,450
that this that professional and curated

102
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,580
content is really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

103
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,400
having the other stuff beneath it is

104
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,080
great and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you can make a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

105
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">money on remnant inventory you know the</font>

106
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,120
margins aren't great but I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

107
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,890
do pretty well with it but without the

108
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,130
without the branded top level I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

109
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,430
it's hard to create real sustainable

110
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,840
businesses now at village ventures

111
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,660
you've developed a very clear thesis

112
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,850
with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> very key points to it</font>

113
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,890
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just invest in any content</font>

114
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,480
business so talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that yeah you</font>

115
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,529
know we

116
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,200
have have learned over over the last six

117
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,910
or seven years<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are basically</font>

118
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,910
three pieces to this content business

119
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,590
vertical content business that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

120
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,270
makes sense the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font>

121
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,860
really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have an owned and</font>

122
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,650
operated you know branded content hub

123
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,610
you know in parenting we have babble.com

124
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,560
in in technology we have toptenreviews

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,530
com that that's a really important thing

126
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,210
to have you know a single URL that's

127
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,639
attracting organic traffic that's

128
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,470
professionally produced and then the

129
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,790
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is some sort of</font>

130
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">direct-to-consumer revenue stream</font>

131
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,410
whether it's subscriptions or e-commerce

132
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,790
you know that those two things really

133
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,550
work well together to drive the overall

134
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,470
business because the direct consumer

135
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,740
piece allows you to do custom<font color="#CCCCCC"> roi</font>

136
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,200
focused customer acquisition to bring

137
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">people into your world and then you can</font>

138
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,760
move them over usually using email

139
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,290
newsletters to the owned and operated

140
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,169
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you can make more margin</font>

141
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then the third piece is adding an ad</font>

142
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,550
network layer on top of that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

143
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,320
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't it's hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a single</font>

144
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,810
URL past 10 or 20 million uniques you

145
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,400
know if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to 30 40 50</font>

146
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,229
million uniques in a vertical you really

147
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,460
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add other smaller content sites</font>

148
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,070
that you can represent and leverage your

149
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,350
your ad sales relationships and the one

150

piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think very</font>

151
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,780

00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,580
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last 15</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years have made the</font>

153
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,229
mistake of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking well we'll start a</font>

154
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:49,750
URL will buy advertisements on TV people

155
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,460
will see those and go and what you're

156
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,990
saying is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to be</font>

157
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,479
marketing a very specific service you're

158
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:56,770
going to do that with keywords or

159
