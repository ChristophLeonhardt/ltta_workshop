ONLY HAPPENING BECAUSE A PARENT

47
00:01:22,813 --> 00:01:23,880
WAS ANGRY THEIR DAUGHTER DIDN'T

48
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,783

55
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:39,396
BECAUSE OF ONE CHILD WHO DID NOT

56
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:41,231
MAKE TEAM.

57
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:42,799
AND THEIR PARENT COMPLAINT.
