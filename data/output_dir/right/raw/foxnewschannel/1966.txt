AMBITIONS.

7
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:28,536
STATE DEPARTMENT PRESS OFFICER

8
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:29,871
ANALYST FOR THE TREASURY

00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:39,580
DEPARTMENT MORGAN ORTEGAS.

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,014
GOOD MORNING.

11
00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:40,748
YESTERDAY EVERYBODY WAS TALKING

12
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:41,482
ABOUT WE LOVE THE AGREEMENTS, WE

13
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:46,854
HATE THE AGREEMENT BUT WHAT

14
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:47,388
HAPPENS IN 90 DAYS?

15
00:00:47,388 --> 00:00:48,122
>> THERE IS A FALSE EQUIVALENCY,

16
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:48,856
THERE IS THE DEAL OR THE WAR, A

17
00:00:48,856 --> 00:00:51,826
BINARY CHOICE AND I DON'T THINK

18
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:52,326
THAT WILL HAPPEN.

19
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:58,766
HERE IS WHERE IT BECOMES AN

20
00:00:58,766 --> 00:00:59,500
INTERESTING MOMENT IN TIME WITH

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,901
OUR ALLIES.

22
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:00,501
WE HAVE OUR ALLIES ON A

23
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:00,968
DIFFERENT PAGE.

24
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:04,605
WHEN THE PRES. MADE THE DECISION

25
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:05,272
YESTERDAY SAUDI ARABIA AND

26
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,942
ISRAEL CAME OUT WITH SUPPORTIVE

27
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,243
PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND BACKS UP

28
00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:09,944
WHAT THE PRES. SAID ABOUT HIS

29
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:20,221
DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE

30
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:20,955
DEAL, BAILEY BALLISTIC MISSILES,

31
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:21,422
THE WHOLE LIST.

32
00:01:21,422 --> 00:01:22,089
ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE A

33
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:22,723
PROBLEM WITH OUR EUROPEAN

34
00:01:22,723 --> 00:01:23,057
ALLIES.

35
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:25,693
THEY HAVE OVER THE PAST WEEK 2

36
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:26,327
YEARS AND SANCTIONS WERE

37
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:27,061
RELEASED DONE A LOT OF BUSINESS

38
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:27,962
IN IRAN.

39
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,198
YOU SAY TO THESE EUROPEAN

40
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:30,832
COMPANIES UNDER WHAT THE

41
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:31,465
TREASURY DEPARTMENT SAID

42
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:33,634
YESTERDAY YOU HAVE TO WALK BACK

43
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:36,704
THAT BUSINESS.

44
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:37,438
IT WILL BE A HARD POOL FOR THE

45
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,975
EUROPEANS TO SWALLOW.

46
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,709
WHAT YOU SAW THE IRANIAN REGIME

47
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:47,381
COME OUT WITH, WE WILL CONTINUE

48
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:47,949
TO ABIDE BY THE DEAL.

49
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:53,554
HERE IS THE TOUGH CHOICE FOR THE

50
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:54,288
ADMINISTRATION AND THE TREASURY

51
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:54,989
DEPARTMENT, IF THE EUROPEANS

52
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,158
STAY IN THE DEAL AND EUROPEAN

53
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:57,792
BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO DO

54
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:59,827
BUSINESS IN IRAN WILL WE START

55
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:02,496
SANCTIONING EUROPEAN COMPANIES?

56
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:06,334
YOU HAVE SEEN MANY EUROPEAN

57
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:11,138
BANKS IN NEW YORK CITY THAT WERE

58
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:11,973
FINED HEAVILY FOR DOING BUSINESS

59
00:02:11,973 --> 00:02:15,476
IN IRAN.

60
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:20,014
BANKS HAVEN'T GONE BACK IN SINCE

61
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:20,581
THAT ACTION HAPPENED.

62
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:21,549
THAT IS GOING TO BE THE

63
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:21,916
SHOWDOWN.

64
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,952
IT IS A FALSE CHOICE.

65
00:02:24,952 --> 00:02:32,326
ROB: IT SEEMS TO BE LOOKING AT

66
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:33,060
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID, THE US

67
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,794
MAYBE GET SANCTIONING BANKING,

68
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:34,495
ENERGY AND RELATED ACTIVITIES

69
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:37,565
BUT IN 90 DAYS THE US MAY

70
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:42,003
SANCTION ANYTHING ELSE EXEMPTED

71
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:48,509
UNDER THE JC TOA.

72
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:49,076
ALL THINGS IN LIFE --

73
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:49,777
>> YOU ARE SEEING SOME DEALS

74
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:52,914
WITH BOEING AND OTHERS THAT HAVE

75
00:02:52,914 --> 00:02:56,651
WAIVERS, BUSINESS DEALS, TO DO

76
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:02,590
THOSE DEALS IN IRAN THE TREASURY

77
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,291
SECRETARY, STEVE MNUCHIN SAID

78
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:03,991
THOSE WAIVERS WOULD BE WALKED

79
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:08,696
BACK BUT THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE

80
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:09,030
ALLOWED.

81
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,764
I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A

82
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:10,498
TOUGH DECISION TO MAKE RELATING

83
00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:13,968
TO EUROPEAN ALLIES BUT A FALSE

84
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:14,702
EQUIVALENT TO SAY ALL OUR ALLIES

85
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:19,640
ARE POURING OUT.

86
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,374
OUR ALLIES ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE

87
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:23,644
OF THIS, THEY ARE THE MOST

88
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:26,147
DIRECTLY THREATENED BY IRAN AND

89
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:29,450
THAT IS WHY THEY ARE SUPPORTING

90
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,953
THESE ACTIONS.

91
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:39,427
>> MIKE POMPEO, WHAT IS HE GOING

92
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:39,860
TO ACCOMPLISH?

93
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,594
JUST GETTING THESE INDIVIDUALS

94
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:41,195
BACK, SETTING THE STAGE?

95
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:43,097
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE HIM DO?

96
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:47,768
>> I HAVE LUNCH WITH SOMEONE

97
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:48,502
FROM BILL CLINTON'S WORLD GOING

98
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:52,073
TO NORTH KOREA WITH THE OBAMA

99
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:52,773
ADMINISTRATION, HE WAS BLOWN

100
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:55,409
AWAY WITH WHAT TRUMP HAS BEEN

101
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:59,013
ABLE TO DO IN GIVING MEETINGS TO

102
00:03:59,013 --> 00:03:59,380
THE TABLE.

103
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,081
SECRETARY POMPEO WAS CLEARLY

104
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:01,282
THERE TO LAY OUT THE TERMS OF

105
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:06,387
THE DEAL BUT THE REAL REASON IS

106
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:07,088
TO HOPEFULLY GET THESE THREE

107
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:07,922
AMERICAN HOSTAGES BACK AND

108
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:11,959
HOPEFULLY THEY ARE IN BETTER

109
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,494
CONDITION THAN AUTO --OTTO WARMB

110
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:14,028
CONDITION THAN AUTO --OTTO WAR B

111
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:20,885
WARMBIER

112
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,601
WARMBIE

113
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:21,969
WARMBIER.

114
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:22,636
>> THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT OUR

115
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:23,371
FRIENDS IN THIS PRES. IS RIGHT

116
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:24,372
TO BE TALKING -- POMPEO IS THE

117
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:24,839
BEST MESSENGER.

118
00:04:24,839 --> 00:00:00,000
ROB: WHEN YOU START A JOB YOU
