00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,790
viewing in 3d hurts my head<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,559
usually throw those glasses I think it's

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,120
unnecessary yeah I wouldn't be too keen

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,190

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,160
just having your eyes open to the air I

00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,219
technology gets better it's going to be

16
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:37,809
very popular and probably will become

17
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:38,920
mainstream I think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> get really</font>
