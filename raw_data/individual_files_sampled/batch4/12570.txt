the film about Kermit Gosnell has entered its its second week at the box office it entered its second week this past weekend and despite only showing on 600 or so theaters in its first week and despite the limited budget and despite being ignored by the media it completely it managed to crack the top ten in its first week top ten at the box office which is extremely impressive okay to get into the top ten given the situation now keep this in mind when it comes to box office totals and you hear about you know you hear about a movie like like Avengers is number one at the box office for ten straight weeks or whatever well keep in mind that movies like The Avengers they open on four thousand screens and they have hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing and merchandise I mean you can't avoid them but you know for six months leading up to the movie coming out the movies everywhere everywhere you go you see it you see previews of commercials and merchandise and then it's on every single screen across the universe and so a movie like that it has to be number it's got to be number one for two months if it's not that it's a massive failure because the movies the movie studios pay a lot of money to manufacture interest and to get the movies out there and so that's why in my mind there's nothing particularly impressive about a massively hyped massively expensive movie showing on four thousand screens with 15 showings apiece ending up number one at the box office but that's why I'm never you know every time there's a new Marvel movie or Star Wars and everyone's like oh it's the number one movie in history again we of course number one that you know movie tickets now cost 87 dollars as opposed to as opposed to in the 90s and there were five dollars and the movie studios paying millions of dollars to brainwash us into see in the the freaking thing so of course of course it's number one that's not a president but a movie like like Gosnell with no press very little marketing on a few screens in a small budget well cracking a million dollars and the top ten in that case is huge yet as the Daily wire reported this weekend the film was dropped again only at second week it was dropped from almost 200 screens of the of the only 600 it was showing on in its second week this is a top 10 movie that was dropped in its second week and dropped from theaters with 20 or 30 screens where it was in the top 10 among all those films and many of those theaters dropped it after one week which is unprecedented which is it's just it's unheard of despite what anyone might want to say to try to you know come up with a rationale this is unheard of this doesn't this doesn't have even if a movie performs really poorly in its first week it's pretty rare for it to be dropped after one week usually at least gets one other week but to be a top 10 movie and then get dropped after after seven days in the theater it's just it's ridiculous
