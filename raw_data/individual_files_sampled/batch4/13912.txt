this was the big question was president Trump going to be handing kim jeong-hoon a public-relations victory by going over and hanging out with him or was he gonna get some serious concessions now we don't know the answer to that yet and this is my note of caution we don't know yet so what you're hearing from a lot of folks on the right is triumph Nobel Prize everything great has already happened nothing great has happened in fact right now the ledger is stacked in favor of kim jong hoon because we just handed them a massive PR victory we'll go through the PR victory and all the mistakes that were made over the last 36 hours and handing them a PR victory now all those mistakes turn to gold if Kim Jong moon actually wants to denuclearize so if the White House knows something that we don't if the White House actually has some sort of verifiable regime of dismantlement coming then this is the greatest move of all time if they don't then it's a debacle okay there really is no in-between there's no in-between position where Trump goes over there and makes nice and plays kissy face with Kim Jong hoon and doesn't get anything out of him where it's not a debacle and on the other hand if he gets what he wants out of kim jeong-hoon then obviously everything is justified but right now everybody is jumping to their various positions you got folks on the right and they're jumping to the position that Donald Trump has done something masterful to masterstroke it's genius it's magma magma 3d underwater chest upside down right and how do we know that well because Trump's doing it right if Obama had done the same thing we would have gone nuts but if Obama had gone over to Singapore and hung out with Kim Jong hoon and stacked the American flag alongside the flag of North Korea we would have gone crazy because the flag of North Korea is the modern-day equivalent of the swastika they imagined that Kim Jong Lunas Hitler and you understand a little bit better why it might not be a great idea to have all these photo ops with a guy without receiving any sort of serious concessions in the first place so on the right they're jumping to everything is great everything's gonna be fine no downside all terrific and on the Left they're jumping too this is the worst thing that has ever happened in the history of the world the same people who are insuring Obama for signing the world's worst nuclear deal with Iran are now saying the president Trump has done something terrible by meeting with Kim Jong hoon even though the real concessions made at this meeting are not particularly strong right he didn't actually commit to virtually anything he give in to a few things none of them are good but we don't know yet yeah I spit I say a lot on the show I spend a lot of time on my show saying let's wait for the evidence to come in and there's another case where I'm gonna say let's wait for the evidence to come in but we can say that President Trump gave up something very serious in these in this in this photo op he gave up the idea that America as the freest country on the face of the planet and most powerful country on the face of planet has the capacity to talk down to kim jong hoon we should be talking down to him he's a tin-pot dictator piece of crap he's a horrible human being and legitimizing him and pretending that he's a normal person and that this is a normal regime and then got to have normal relations with this normal regime without any serious concessions being made I don't know why the president does that I honestly don't I don't know why this wasn't done from lower level negotiators I don't know why this wasn't done through Mike Pompeo I don't know why this wasn't done through the CIA there are plenty of ways to negotiate these deals having the president show up for it for a nice back rub with Kim jong-un doesn't seem to me like like a worthwhile cause
