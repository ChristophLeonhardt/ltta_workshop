00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,640
Hey guys!

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,860
It's Messyourself here.

3
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,200
Now, before you get into this video...

4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,140
I just wanted to thanks

5
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,140
Monster Legends...

6
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,140
...for sponsoring this video.

7
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,140
If you guys have no idea what Monster Legends...

8
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,140
...is, it's a free app on iOS

9
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,140
and Android.

10
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,140
And you basically have to collect

11
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,140
monsters, okay?!

12
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,140
There are literally hundreds of monsters in the game.

13
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,140
And the main progression is like...

14
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,140
...evolving your monsters, and making them stronger.

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,140
By fighting OTHER monsters...

16
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,140
...in like these really

17
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,140
epic battles, okay? The game's great

18
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,140
It's one of those games that's like...

19
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,140
...really addicting. They even

20
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,140
added relics recently in the game.

21
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,140
And these relics basically enhance your monster...

22
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,140
...abilities, and make them stronger

23
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,140
in battles. There is like so much content

24
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,140
in the game, alright?

25
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,640
So, if you wanna help me out...

26
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,840
...okay, and support me

27
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,840

00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,140
...download the game for yourself, okay?

31
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,140
It would really help me out.

32
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,140
But anyway guys, thank you guys so much for watching, and...

33
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,140

37
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,140

Headphones! (Flashback ends) Okay, the Impossible Quiz Book.

44
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,140
Now, this game is basically

45
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,140
a game where they asked you

46
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,140

51
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,140
Alright, so we got a cat... (The cat's name is Chris)

52
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,140
