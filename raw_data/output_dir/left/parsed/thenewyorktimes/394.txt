Double Dutch provides activity for some
children who have nothing else to do.
 creates confidence, creates health 
and wellness within them.
And gives them a place to shelter 
and just be kids again.
Competitiveness definitely changed the 
style. Before it was just jumping,
now everybody has — they come out with 
their own colors
and their own way of doing things.
I think that diversity will 
bring it back.
Everyone wants to do it, it looks like.
There’s older, younger people, boys, 
girls, everyone …
double Dutch is coming back.
