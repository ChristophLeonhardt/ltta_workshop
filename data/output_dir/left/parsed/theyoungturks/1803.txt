Fifth Amendment Fifth Amendment Fifth
Amendment horrible horrible when you are
given immunity that means that you've
probably committed a crime so there are
five people taking the Fifth Amendment
like you see on the mob right you see
the mob takes if it if you're innocent
why you taking the fifth when you have
your staff taking the Fifth Amendment
taking the fifth so they're not
prosecuted when you have the man that
set up the illegal server taking the
fifth I think it's disgraceful
