00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,440
The Iron Mountain underground
storage facility is located in

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,880
what was formerly a
limestone mine.

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,990
The nickname internally within
our company is "the underground."

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,050
The seasons never change
220 feet underground.

5
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,960
It's very easy for us to maintain
the proper temperature

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,570
and humidity based on the type
of media that we store here.

7
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,320
I am Bob Koszela and I'm with Iron Mountain
entertainment services

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,810
here 220 feet underground
at the Universal Music vault.

9
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,470
Universal Music is the largest
record label in the world and

10
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,259
this collection represents
the historic recordings of

11
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:09,850
virtually every known
artist in the world.

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,690
This collection is comprised of virtually
every known audio format

13
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,430
throughout history. Having them all
consolidated here in

14
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,680
such close proximity to our digital
studios, allows the clients to be able

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,570
to move these assets without
ever leaving the security of

16
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,680
"the underground" and have them digitized
and safely delivered across the web.

17
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:46,470
We have the Getty photographic collection
which consists of, at this site,

18
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,320
over 25 million
photographic images.

19
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,070

Marilyn Monroe.

all of her husbands,
her death, her funeral

22
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,470
the police investigation. We have
folders and folders of her content.

23
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,800
It's impervious from the majority of the
manmade disasters as well as natural

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,820
disasters, since we are a couple
hundred feet underground.

25
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,330
We have our own fire brigade.

26
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,920
We have armed guards at the
gate 24 hours a day seven days

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:00:00,000
a week protecting the material, the media
that our customers are sending to us.
