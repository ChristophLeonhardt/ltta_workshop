1
00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:01,792
CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS AND

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,960
UNPREDICTABLE ON A NATIONAL

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,394
DEBATE STAGE.

4
00:00:03,394 --> 00:00:05,363
SOUND FAMILIAR?

5
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:06,697
>> Martha: IT DOES.

6
00:00:06,697 --> 00:00:08,399
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

7
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:10,735
YOU'RE NOT EXCLUSIVELY, DON DON

8
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:11,135
BLANKENSHIP.

9
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:13,771
A CANDIDATE FOR THE U.S. SENATE

10
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,773
OF FORMER MASSEY ENERGY SUN

11
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:16,373
DON'T LET COMPANY CEO.

12
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:18,242
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE

13
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:19,877
TONIGHT AGAIN.

14
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:22,880
GOOD NEWS, IF IT'S TRUE THAT YOU

15
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,948
MIGHT HAVE PICKED UP AS MUCH AS

16
00:00:23,948 --> 00:00:24,882
EIGHT POINTS IN THE BALLS LAST

17
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:25,750
NIGHT AND WITH THEIR DATA, BUT

18
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,517
YOU HEAR WHAT IS COMING AT YOU

19
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:28,352
FROM THE WEEKLY STANDARD.

20
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:29,120
THEY SAY THAT YOU ARE ANOTHER

21
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,155
SHARON ANGLE.

22
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:33,357
ANOTHER ROY MOORE AND THAT YOU

23
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:34,959
PRESENT A DISASTER TO YOUR PARTY

24
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:37,161
AND THE GENERAL ELECTION IN

25
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:38,362
WEST VIRGINIA.

26
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:40,364
>> I THINK THEY ARE JUST WRONG.

27
00:00:40,364 --> 00:00:41,165
THEY'VE BEEN WRONG A LOT.

28
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:42,567
THEY'VE BEEN WRONG SO FAR IN HIS

29
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:43,167
CAMPAIGN.

30
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:45,836
I'M A LITTLE BIT MIFFED THAT A

31
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:47,672
CHINA PERSON IS DISCRIMINATORY.

32
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,474
I THOUGHT THAT IF YOU REFER TO

33
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:51,676
SOMEONE AS AN ASIAN OR WHATEVER

34
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,377
YOU MIGHT TRY TO THROW IT IN

35
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:54,979
THAT CATEGORY BUT SOMEBODY FROM

36
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:56,781
CHINA IS FROM CHINA, SOMEBODY

37
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:58,382
FROM THE U.S. IS FROM THE U.S.,

38
00:00:58,382 --> 00:00:59,984
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT ANYBODY

39
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:01,786
THINKS THAT IS A RACIAL SLUR,

40
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:03,387
I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T SEE IT.

41
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:04,622
>> Martha: UNDERSTOOD.

42
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:06,657
WHAT ABOUT COCAINE MITCH?

43
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:08,459
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD

44
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:11,362
SAY THAT'S A BIG REACH AND THAT

45
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,196
IT SUGGESTS SOMETHING THAT IS

46
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:15,967
SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

47
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:19,136
AND THAT IT IS SUCH A TANGENTIAL

48
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:22,073
ASSOCIATION WITH A SHIP THAT HAD

49
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:24,675
DRUGS ON THAT IS SOMEHOW RELATED

50
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:26,377
TO HIS WIFE'S FATHER.

51
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,347
YOU HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT --

52
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:30,348
YOU'VE BEEN SO MALIGNED FOR

53
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:33,251
THINGS YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T DO AND

54
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:36,754
THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

55
00:01:36,754 --> 00:01:38,556
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THAT TACT

56
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,223
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?

57
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:41,359
>> MAYBE IT'S TO MAKE THE POINTS

58
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,093
THAT YOU JUST MADE.

59
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:45,830
THAT I'VE BEEN MALIGNED FOR

60
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,366
THINGS I --

61
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:49,967
>> Martha: SO AN EYE FOR AN

62
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:50,835
EYE I GUESS?

63
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:56,140
>> NO, IT'S MORE OR LESS THAT

64
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,874
THERE ARE THINGS THAT DON'T GO

65
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:59,076
THE WAY YOU WANT THEM TO GO.

66
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:01,479
HAVING COCAINE ON A FAMILY-OWNED

67
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,948
SHIP CERTAINLY SHOULD BE OF

68
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:05,182
INTEREST BECAUSE COCAINE DEATHS

69
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:06,117
IN THIS COUNTRY KEEP GOING UP

70
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:09,787
AND EVEN THOUGH THAT SHIP -- I

71
00:02:09,787 --> 00:02:10,488
THINK HEADED TO EUROPE.

72
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:13,391
WE STILL NEED TO BE AWARE THAT

73
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:14,392
THERE ARE COCAINE AND OTHER

74
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:16,627
DRUGS MOVING ON THE HIGH SEAS ON

75
00:02:16,627 --> 00:02:18,763
COMMERCIAL SHIPS AND IF NOTHING

76
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:19,497
ELSE SHOULD MAKE MAKE US AWARE

77
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:23,968
THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHEN

78
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:25,970
THESE COMMERCIAL SHIPS ARE

79
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,971
DOCKING.

80
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:28,139
CERTAINLY THE FAMILY OF ELAINE

81
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:28,806
CHAO AND McCONNELL SHOULD BE

82
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:32,343
NO EXCEPTION TO THEM.

83
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:34,178
>> Martha: AS I SAID, PEOPLE

84
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:35,479
WOULD FIND THAT TO BE A BIT OF A

85
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,815
REACH TO CALL THEM COCAINE

86
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:40,351
MITCH, BUT YOU HAVE SAID THAT

87
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:41,952
AND THAT YOUR EXPLANATION FOR

88
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:42,553
IT.

89
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:43,287
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS,

90
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:45,489
BECAUSE IF YOU DO WIN IN THE

91
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:51,362
PRIMARY NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT,

92
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:52,563
DEMOCRATS ARE PRETTY MUCH

93
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:53,564
ALREADY PREPARING ADS.

94
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:54,298
YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE KIND OF

95
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:56,334
ADS THAT WILL BE LEVELED AGAINST

96
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:56,600
YOU.

97
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,770
ONE OF THEM WILL GO AFTER YOU ON

98
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,771
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES.

99
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:01,972
THEY WILL SAY THE METAL YOU USED

100
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:04,175
FOR MINING WEST VIRGINIA CAUSE

101
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:05,343
CANCER IN SOME PEOPLE AND YOU

102
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:06,477
DIVERTED THE WATER SOURCE TO

103
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,511
YOUR OWN HOME WHILE YOU LET THE

104
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,480
WATER IN THE REST OF HER

105
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,915
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAD A COAL

106
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:13,651
SLURRY AND IT BE CONTAMINATED.

107
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,354
THOSE WILL BE ASKED OF YOU.

108
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:18,456
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THOSE

109
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:20,391
CHARGES?

110
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:22,693
>> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NOT EVEN

111
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:24,261
MY HOUSE.

112
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:25,162
THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO START.

113
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:25,896
>> Martha: DID YOU PROVIDE

114
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:26,864
YOUR OWN WATER SOURCE IN YOUR

115
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:29,667
NEIGHBORHOOD FROM A DIFFERENT

116
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,671
WHILE?

117
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,338
>> NO.

118
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:35,573
IT'S A LONGER STORY THAN YOU

119
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:37,074
PROBABLY GOT TIME FOR, BUT THE

120
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:38,376
CITY, WHICH IS A SMALL TOWN

121
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:40,978
NEARBY HAD RUN WATER DOWN CLOSE

122
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,380
TO MY HOME ON THEIR OWN AND GAVE

123
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,481
ME A CHANCE TO PICK UP THAT

124
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:43,981
WATER.

125
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:46,050
BUT AT THAT POINT, NO ONE EVEN

126
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,618
KNEW THERE WAS THIS CONCERN

127
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:51,956
ABOUT ANY WELLS.

128
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:54,392
IT'S EASY TO MAKE UP STORIES AND

129
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:55,493
AS YOU SAID THEY ARE ALREADY

130
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:56,227
RUNNING THOSE ADS AND THEY ARE

131
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:59,063
PROBABLY GOING TO GET BEAT IN

132
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:01,565
THE PRIMARY AND JOE MANCHIN HAS

133
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:03,367
SO MUCH BAGGAGE THAT HE WILL BE

134
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:04,835
MUCH EASIER TO BEAT, SO I'M NOT

135
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,937
CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO

136
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:08,005
BEAT JOE MANCHIN.

137
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:09,774
I'VE BECOME TWO OR THREE TIMES

138
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:10,875
BEFORE ON ISSUES AND THE MEDIA

139
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,644
ON THESE ISSUES WITH A WATER

140
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:14,378
SPELLER WITH AN ACCIDENT OR

141
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:17,047
WHATEVER ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT

142
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:17,680
THAN THE BEHAVIOR OF JOE

143
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,583
MANCHIN, WHICH IS INTENTIONAL.

144
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,685
>> Martha: SO IN TERMS OF THE

145
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:23,654
FACT THAT -- WE BROUGHT THIS UP

146
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:25,356
BACK IN    LAST NIGHT.

147
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:27,191
WITH REGARDS TO YOUR TIME IN

148
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:28,359
PRISON, YOUR PROBATION IS

149
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:29,927
SCHEDULED TO END THE DAY AFTER

150
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:34,632
THE PRIMARY, IS THAT CORRECT?

151
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:35,466
>> YES.

152
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:35,933
>> Martha: OKAY.

153
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:38,135
LAST NIGHT WAS INTERESTING THAT

154
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:38,836
NEITHER ONE OF YOUR OPPONENTS

155
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:41,839
REALLY WENT AFTER YOU ABOUT THAT

156
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,040
AT ALL, BUT HERE AGAIN IF YOU DO

157
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,177
WIN THE PRIMARY IT WILL BE FRONT

158
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,412
AND CENTER AND I KNOW THAT YOU

159
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:50,581
BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE FALSELY

160
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,582
IMPRISONED, BUT DO YOU THINK

161
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,349
THAT WILL BE A LIABILITY FOR YOU

162
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:55,486
IF YOU GET INTO A HEAD-TO-HEAD

163
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:59,190
MATCHUP WITH SENATOR MANCHIN?

164
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,958
>> FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T BELIEVE

165
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,626
THAT I WAS FALSELY IMPRISONED, I

166
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:04,628
KNOW THAT I WAS FALSELY

167
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:05,396
IMPRISONED.

168
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:07,198
THE REASON THEY DON'T ATTACK ME

169
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:08,432
AS THEY ARE BOTH ATTORNEYS AND

170
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:10,367
THEY KNOW WHAT AND 302S ARE AND

171
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:11,969
THEY KNOW FROM THE FILING THAT

172
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:14,371
WAS MADE THAT TEN OF THE 12 TO

173
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:15,206
302S THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

174
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:16,841
PROVIDED TO MY DEFENSE FROM THE

175
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:19,076
LEAD WITNESSES WERE NOT, AND

176
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:23,981
THEY KNOW THAT THERE WAS IN FACT

177
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:26,784
61, FOR YOUR LEGAL COMMUNITY OUT

178
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,086
THERE, 302S, DOZENS OF EMAILS

179
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:30,221
THAT HAD EXTREMELY EXCULPATORY

180
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:33,357
INFORMATION, SO THE CASE MORE

181
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:35,125
LIKELY, IF THERE'S ANY JUSTICE,

182
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,961
WILL BE INVALIDATED BEFORE THE

183
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,095
GENERAL ELECTION ANYWAY.

184
00:05:38,095 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH
