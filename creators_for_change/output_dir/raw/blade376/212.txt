00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,349
the summary of what I'm about to say is

2
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,560
just how incredibly proud I am of you

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,740
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that I don't</font>

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,100
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a lot but it doesn't mean that</font>

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,449
I don't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way I speak about you</font>

6
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,850
to a lot of my friends and talk to you

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,510
about foreign family as well and just

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,030
you know how incredibly proud I am of

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,520
you because what you've done your entire

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,980
life is just such an incredible

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,370
achievement and although I've never

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,460
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> you my hero I guess the reason</font>

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,559
why and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to maybe why I</font>

14
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't said how proud I am of you much</font>

15
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,440
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past is because I feel that it's</font>

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,180
so obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hurt even just</font>

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,860
gone such a long way in life from

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,520
starting off leaving school early 2m

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,900
working as a mechanic in<font color="#E5E5E5"> london</font>

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,659
most senior positions of such a large

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,299
company and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that you know that's</font>

23
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,020
an inspiration to anyone and he would

24
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,890

25
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,390
really big inspiration and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just want</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you to know that you know we we have our</font>

28
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,170
arguments we have our little bits of

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,840
bickering but that's just life and if I

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,680

I've done a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in the past</font>

35
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,200
which may have seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I took things</font>

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,680
for granted all was careless but

37
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,480
not making<font color="#CCCCCC"> excuses I think it's just a</font>

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,950
testament to how much freedom you've

39
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,470
given me because the more freedom you've

40
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,620
given the more freedom there is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

41
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,460
to make mistakes um but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>
