the dirt beneath our fingertips is my
testimony for when we buried our King in
the soil to feed our only change
branches one steady growth in you tried
to tame the house stallion hearts from
you sell our homeland but the rains will
always be in our hands
believe me when I say even if you would
hang me with my veins of my blood and
milk and honey
Oh double-wide to snap off our olive
branches rip off the leaves swallow our
olives and spit and to hand us back and
naked the olive branch for the you tell
the world you want pieces you want us in
pieces
what a fake it is to be exiled by the
Exile
