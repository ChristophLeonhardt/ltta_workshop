in Moscow did you finally get a feeling
that this opening ceremony in the first
game will be the best ever is that the
kind of atmosphere that you sing well
the whole world cup will be the best
ever I'm sure when I see the enthusiasm
and when I see how Russia is prepared
how Moscow is prepared for this game how
everyone is looking forward to that I'm
convinced they're convinced possibly a
final message for the fans we're going
to see the game at Luzhniki and defends
everywhere else in Russia who will
definitely want Russia to win their
first game well you know enjoy every
second of it support your team fully and
then you know the pitch decides but the
motivation certainly there thank you
thank you very much
