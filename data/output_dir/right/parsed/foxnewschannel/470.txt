GREG: SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT TAKE
THE BROOM TO LEG ROOM?
THE HOUSE PASSED A 2,000 PAGE
BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE FAA
TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THE WAY
WE FLY, INCLUDING MINIMUM
REQUIREMENTS FOR SEAT SIZES AND
LEG ROOM.
TYRUS, BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT,
AIRLINE SEATS ARE GETTING
TIGHTER THAN BIKE SHORTS ON A
HIPPO.
GREG: TRUST ME, MY HIPPO HATES
PUTTING THEM ON BUT I LOVE
WATCHING HIM TAKE THEM OFF.
ENOUGH WITH THE HIPPO STUFF.
LEG ROOM IS SHRINKING.
EVEN I HAVE NOTICED.
AND I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH LEG.
GREG: NOW, I KNOW WE'RE A VERY
DIVIDED NATION, BUT WE CAN ALL
AGREE FLYING SUCKS.
BUT SHOULD GOVERNMENT BE IN
CHARGE OF THIS?
IF THEY THINK THEY CAN HANDLE
LEG ROOM, WHY NOT THE BOARDING
PROCESS OR THE SUPER TINY
BATHROOMS.
I CAN'T EVEN READ IN THERE.
GREG: TRY TO READ THE "WALL
STREET JOURNAL" OR TRY IT LIKE
THAT, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.
GREG: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FOOD.
HERE'S A VIDEO I TOOK OF MY
FLIGHT ATTENDANT TRYING TO COOK
MY EGGS.
OH MAN I BURNED MY MOUTH ON
THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
I HAVE TO GO TO YOU TYRUS FOR NO
APPARENT REASON.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY.
SIZIST PIG.
>> GREG HAS A HARD TIME FITTING
IN THE BATHROOM AT THE AIRPORT,
DOES ANYBODY REALLY FEEL SORRY
FOR HIM?
LISTEN, THIS IS A SERIOUS THING.
GREG: DO YOU WANT GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION?
>> BE QUIET BECAUSE THIS IS
SERIOUS.
IF THIS WAS AN ISSUE ABOUT
HAVING A LITTLE THING TO HELP
YOU SIT WITH YOUR FEET ON THE
TOILET, I WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT
YOU.
I WOULD BE QUIET AND RESPECTFUL
TO YOUR PLIGHT IF YOUR FEET
DON'T TOUCH THE GROUND WHEN YOU
USE THE BATHROOM.
I GET IT.
>> BUT THIS IS -- THANK YOU.
>> HOW DARE YOU?
I HAVE ACTUAL FOOTAGE OF ME
SUFFERING IN AN AIRPLANE.
I KNOW IT WOULD TAKE TWO OF YOUR
FEET TO BE ONE IN ONE OF MY
SHOES.
LOOK AT THAT.
BY THE WAY, THE PERSON WHO TOOK
THAT PICTURE WAS NONE OTHER THAN
GREG GUTFELD.
NO PRIVACY.
SOMEONE'S LIKE FOX DOESN'T FLY
YOU FIRST CLASS?
THAT IS FIRST CLASS.
>> LOOK AT THAT, I HAVE TO LEAN
TO THE SIDE TO SLEEP.
IT IS BRUTAL.
SO NORMALLY LIKE MY LIBERTARIAN
FRIEND KAT OVER HERE, I DON'T
LIKE GOVERNMENT OR NOTHING, BUT
IF UNCLE SAM HAS GOT TO GET IN
TO GET OUT OF THE JAM, I'M WITH
IT.
HELP ME OUT.
GREG: ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S -- KAT, AS YOU KNOW, I
HATE BIG GOVERNMENT UNLESS THEY
DO THINGS THAT I LIKE.
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?
>> I'M NOT A HYPOCRITE.
I THINK THAT IF AN AIRLINE
WANTED TO EXIST WHERE THEY JUST
LIKE STACK PEOPLE ON EACH
OTHER'S LAPS AND IT WAS CHEAPER,
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT
ALTERNATIVE.
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
FLY PEOPLE IN PLANES WITHOUT
SEATS WHERE YOU JUST MEANDER
ABOUT AND VAPE.
I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE
ALLOWED.
>> I DON'T LIKE THAT THE
GOVERNMENT TELLS ME THAT I HAVE
TO PUT ON MY SEAT BELTS BECAUSE
OF THE TURBULENCE.
I'M A GROWN WOMAN.
I CAN HANDLE MY OWN TURBULENCE
HOW I WANT TO.
>> HOWEVER, THE PLANES ARE A
LITTLE COLD FOR ME.
>> THEY ARE ALWAYS A LITTLE
COLD.
I ALWAYS HAVE TO WEAR SOCKS
UNDER MY SANDALS.
GREG: TERRIBLE.
>> AND PEOPLE SAY KAT WHY DON'T
OWE JUST WEAR TENNIS SHOES?
WELL, BECAUSE THEN I HAVE TO
UNTIE THEM AND TAKE THEM OFF
BECAUSE OF, YOU KNOW, THE TSA
INFRINGING UPON MY RIGHTS EVERY
TIME I WANT TO TRAVEL.
GREG: RIGHT.
>> AND I'M 29.
I'M TOO OLD TO HAVE THE ENERGY
TO DO THAT ALREADY.
GREG: THAT'S TOO BAD.
>> THIS IS WORSE THAN WATCHING
OLD YELLER HEARING HER PROBLEMS.
I'M CRYING TEAS FROM MY HEART.
-- I'M CRYING TEARS FROM MY
HEART.
>> IT IS CHILLY.
I FEEL AS THOUGH I'M IN A
TUNDRA.
>> YOU WOULD BE IF YOU HAD YOUR
SEAT BELT ON WHEN YOUR
TURBULENCE HEAT.
YOU ARE WHAT 68 POUNDS SOAKING
WET, YOU WOULD BE BOUNCING ALL
OVER THE PLANE WITHOUT A SEAT
BELT.
>> I PREFER TO LEAVE MY SEAT
BELT UNBUCKLED AND I PUT A
BLANKET OVER MY HEAD AND VAPE
UNDERNEATH TO PROVE TO MYSELF
I'M STILL FREE.
GREG: YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU TRULY ARE REVOLUTIONARY.
GREG: CHARLIE, IT SCARES ME THAT
REGULATIONS DO MORE HARM THAN
GOOD, LIKE, THERE'S A LIMIT FOR
STEWARDESSES FOR TEN HOUR
SHIFTS.
THAT MEANS IF YOU ARE ON THE TAR
MAC AND ABOUT TO TAKE OFF, LET'S
SAY IT IS DELAYED 45 MINUTES, IT
IS PAST THEIR SHIFT, THEY COULD
TURN AROUND AND DUMP YOU.
>> TOTALLY.
I DESPISE ALL AIRLINES.
I WOULD MAKE A 12 HOUR DRIVE
EASY TO AVOID HAVING TO GET INTO
AN AIRPLANE.
BUT THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT COULD
ACTUALLY MAKE --
GREG: 12 HOURS WITH YOU, OH,
GOD, ANYWAYS, SORRY.
>> THE ONLY THING THAT COULD
MAKE THINGS WORSE THAN AN
AIRLINE WOULD BE THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.
GREG: YEAH.
>> BUT EVERYBODY COMPLAINS ABOUT
TSA.
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO LIKES TO
GO THROUGH TSA?
>> YES, YOU ARE.
GREG: I DON'T MIND IT.
SOME AIRPORTS THEY ARE
FANTASTIC.
AND OTHER ONES THEY ARE JUST
ANGRY, BUT MOST OF THE GUYS ARE
PRETTY GOOD AND THEY ARE FANS OF
THIS SHOW.
REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU START --
GREG: SOMETIMES THEY WILL PUT
THINGS IN MY POCKETS.
GREG: ALL RIGHT.
MADISON, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
THIS?
>> ALL ABOUT EXTRA ROOM, BUT I
DON'T WANT THE REGULATION.
GREG: YEAH.
>> CAPITALISM WORKS.
IF THE PLANES HAVE SEATS THAT
ARE TOO SMALL, PEOPLE WON'T FLY
THOSE AIRLINES ANYMORE.
IT WILL WORK ITSELF OUT.
LET ME SAY ONE THING, THE
AIRLINES ARE TERRIBLE.
IT DOESN'T GOING TO MAKE THEM
BETTER EVEN IF I'M SITTING IN A
SEAT THAT'S BIGGER, I'M GETTING
WATER DRIPPED ON MY HEAD HALF
THE TIME.
GREG: THE WATER THING -- I
NOTIFIED THEM THAT THERE WAS
WATER DRIPPING, AND THEY GO OH
YEAH.
>> I SAT DOWN --
GREG: CONDENSATION.
BY THE WAY, HERE'S MY THEORY ON
WHY PEOPLE ARE SO HOSTILE WHEN
THEY FLY.
DID ANYBODY EVER SEE THE MOVIE
SNOW PIERCER?
>> NO.
GREG: SO WE'RE DEVELOPING A
CLASS SYSTEM WHERE DEPENDING ON
HOW MUCH YOU PAY IT'S HOW MUCH
COMFORT YOU GET.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE
AIRLINES.
IT IS JUST LIKE SNOW PIERCER
WHICH WAS A SEGMENTED CAPSULE
