What I want you to do is
come to the door,

place your hands
through the hole

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,090
as you're going
to be cell moved

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,400
and you get handcuffs
on a move.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,640
Do that now or
force may be used.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,735
Do that now.”

00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,159
Give the officers your arms.”

“Enough.”

13
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:50,235
“Stop resisting.”

14
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:00,047
“Let me up, please!”

15
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:01,197
“You brought this upon yourself, Dungay.”

16
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:02,717
“I can’t breathe!”

17
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:04,047
“Stop resisting with your feet.”

18
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:05,277
“I can’t breathe!”

19
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:06,277
“Stop resisting with your feet.”

20
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:11,827
“Well, stop spitting your blood —”

21
00:01:13,297 --> 00:01:15,307
“You’re the one that brought
this upon yourself, Dungay.”

22
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:31,777
“Make room for
the nurses, boys.”

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,240
“Tell me when you’re
ready for injecting.”

24
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:38,173
“You all right, boss?”
“Yup.”

25
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:40,493
“Nurses in.”

26
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:46,378
“Can’t breathe!”

27
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:52,194
“I can’t breathe!”

28
00:01:58,513 --> 00:01:59,513
“I can’t breathe!”

29
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:00,783
“You talking,
you can breathe.”

30
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:01,452
“I can’t!”

31
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:03,335
“You talking,
you can breathe.”

32
00:02:13,072 --> 00:00:00,000
“Just turn his head to
the right a little bit.”
