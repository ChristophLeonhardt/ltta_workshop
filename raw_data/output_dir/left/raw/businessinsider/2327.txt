18
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,960
in fall<font color="#CCCCCC"> of two thousand eight right in</font>

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,010
the middle of the financial apocalypse

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,149
what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like uh part of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

21
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,789
practical<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision I was like all right</font>

22
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,070
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just graduated from Columbia in May I</font>

23
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,039
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the job the job outlook</font>

24
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,379
and it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty and I had this idea</font>

25
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,900
for a start-up and I decided to kind of

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,810
go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and it was really good thing</font>

27
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,180
though for us because initially we

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,830
thought oh maybe we'll raise money<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

29
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,630
we'll do all these you know being

30
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,170
extravagant spendy things but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked</font>

31
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,080
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> economic situation we realized</font>

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,570
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not going to happen where we</font>

33
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,189
got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this just with what little we</font>

34
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,560
have and so it really forced us to pare

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,290
down and focus we had all these big

36
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,750
extravagant features in mind that would

37
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,640
cost a lot of money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create and we</font>

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,939
just pared it down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the little</font>

39
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,790
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were important product</font>

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,340
features and just those and just build a

41
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,189
minimally Viable Product and we did it

42
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,140
on almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> no money and it ended up</font>

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,119
really making us focus as a company

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,970
great so are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there any specific ways</font>

45
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,130
that you had to innovate or any tricks

46
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,479
that you used in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

47
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,070
product off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right away</font>

48
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,610
uh yeah so one thing was hiring

49
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,520
engineers initially it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was just me and</font>

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">my co-founder he was an engineer that I</font>

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,949
knew from<font color="#E5E5E5"> college talked him into doing</font>

52
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,650
this with me and we had an opportunity

53
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,620
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to a job fair at the Columbia at</font>

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,300
Columbia was the engineering job fair in

55
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fall and and we went and we got all</font>

56
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,820
these amazing resumes and all these

57
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,170
people who wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hire but we didn't</font>

58
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,209
have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hire them but we</font>

59
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:28,290
interviewed we talked to them we said

60
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,820
well what's something we can offer them

61
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,060
that you know they might actually want

62
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,880
and we decided well I phones you know

63
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,350
they're in college they probably don't

64
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,690
have the money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to afford it and you know</font>

65
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,850
it sounds a lot better than saying I'll

66
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,440
give you two hundred dollars I say hey

67
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,030

68
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,040
cool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's useful and strategically</font>

69
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,050
it's useful for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us that they understand</font>

70
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,340
the power of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone is a mobile</font>

71
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,890
computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotcha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was there were there any</font>

72
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,870
tricks that you use to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe service</font>

73
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,850
providers to give you services for for

family member and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the</font>

80
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,560
paperwork afterwards and I was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

81
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,209
struck up casual conversation with the

82
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,670
person son and you know turns out he was

83
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,709
a lawyer asked him what kind and the

84
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:26,850
course of it he turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

85
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,530
corporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> lawyer I mentioned it's like</font>

86
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">she said why I said oh I have the</font>

87
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:32,489
startup work looking for a lawyer and

88
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:33,840
it's like oh what's the startup and I

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,120
kind of flipped the switch and I went in

90
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,030
to pitch mode mm-hmm hi and you know he

91
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,470
was impressed he gave me his number and

92
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,140
then month and a half later out of the

93
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">blue he called me and said that his firm</font>

94
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,769
which happened to be a major

95
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">international law firm with 1,100</font>

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,820
lawyers and 17 or 17 offices worldwide

97
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,950
would take us on as pro bono clients and

98
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,280
that provided a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of validation and</font>

99
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,180
psychologically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

100
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,709
hard when you think like man this is

101
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,390
never going to work to have somebody who

102
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,040
actually believes in you it was a huge

103
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,370
help and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we may we might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even gone</font>

104
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">through with the whole point</font>

105
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,730
if if you hadn't you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> believed in us</font>

106
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,950
at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really early stage great and</font>

107
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,959
finally do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have any words of advice</font>

108
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,820
for other entrepreneurs thinking about

109
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,680
starting a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> while resources are</font>

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,870
still scarce yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

111
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,320
important thing is don't hide your ideas

112
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,699
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's a school of thought</font>

113
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,830
that oh I need to keep all my IDs secret

114
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,020
people are going to steal them people

115
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,160
aren't going to steal your ideas your

116
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea is probably maybe have something</font>

117
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,600
good about them but they mostly suck the

118
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,910
best way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> improve your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas is</font>

119
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,229
actually to go out and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other</font>

120
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:42,509
people and pitch them you know because

121
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:43,979
when we started off we think it would be

122
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,720
a tool we thought speaker text to be a

123
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,280
tool just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you journalists use</font>

124
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,560
privately well in the course of pitching

125
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">gazillions of people we got feedback and</font>

126
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,220
realized huh this could be actually

127
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,220
useful for video publishers and it

128
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,570
expanded our idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our potential</font>

129
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,440
market size gazillion times and going

130
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,400
out there putting yourself out there

131
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,240
pitching even when it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an idea um</font>

132
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,800
you and the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is don't say</font>

133
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to start a company start</font>

134
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,979
the company it's that act of<font color="#CCCCCC"> st. of</font>

135
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,010
doing it is bliss you have to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

136
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,940
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to believe in something</font>

137
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">that doesn't exist yet and that's the</font>

138
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:22,320
after the entrepreneur is to get other

139
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,300
people to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does not yet exist</font>

140
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,639
and to do that you have to see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

141
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">your mind first and if you do that and</font>

142
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,210
you're good people will actually follow

143
00:05:30,210 --> 00:00:00,000
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>
