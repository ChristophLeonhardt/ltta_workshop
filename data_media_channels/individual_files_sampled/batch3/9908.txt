FARMERS ARE FEELING IT RIGHT NOW. CONNELL McSHANE AT A SOW BEAN FARM IN IOWA. CONNELL? HI, NEIL. YOU MAY NOT HAVE SEEN IT IN STOCKS BUT WE SAW A BIT OF A DROP IN SOY BEAN PRICES. AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE ON THIS BEAUTIFUL FARM IN IOWA, THERE'S SOY BEAN PLANTED FOR THE FALL HARVEST. THE HOPE IS THAT MANY OF THOSE SOY BEANS WILL END UP IN CHINA. WE'LL TALK TO RON HECK WHO IS KIND ENOUGH TO HAVE US ON HIS FARM. IT'S A $12 BILLION A YEAR BUSINESS. WITH ALL OF THIS TALK OF TRADE TENSIONS WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON YOUR BUSINESS SO FAR? SO FAR SO GOOD. IT'S ALL TALK. NOTHING HAS HAPPENED YET. ONE OUT OF THREE ROYS OF SOY BEANS GOES TO CHINA. IT'S NERVE RACKING WHEN YOUR COMMODITY IS BEING NEGOTIATED. WHAT IS THE BIG CONCERN? THE CHINESE ARE BUYING OTHER PLACES. THEY'RE BUYING FROM SOUTH AMERICA. WHAT IS THE CONCERN FOR YOU AS THE TALKS CONTINUE? CHINA IS A SEASONAL BUYER. THEY BOTH OF THEIR BEANS FROM SOUTH AMERICA AND MOST OF THE US IS FOR SIX MONTHS. AT THE START OF OUR HARVEST. SO IN SEPTEMBER, THE CHINESE NEED SOY BEANS HERE. IF THEY DON'T, OUR PRICES WILL GO DOWN. AND THEY THREATENED MORE TARIFFS. DO YOU SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S APPROACH? SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE. WE WERE CONTINUALLY LOSING CHINESE MARKET CHAIR. CHINA ALREADY CHARGES IMPORT TARIFFS. SO IT WAS TIME FOR A DISCUSSION. HOPEFULLY TO GET BETTER TERMS FOR FUTURE SALES AND GET OUR MARKET SHARE BACK UP TO WHERE IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO. RON, THANKS SO MUCH. YOU HELPS US UNDERSTAND THE STORY A LOT TODAY. THAT'S THE THING. A GUY LIKE RON DOESN'T CHANGE THE WAY HE DOES BUSINESS, BUT AS YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT, HE'S BRACING FOR THE FUTURE AND HOPING FOR THE BEST.
