PLUS WITH THE START OF EVERY 
NEW SEMESTER. 
THE NEWS THAT TODAY'S GUEST WAS 
COMING REALLY AMPED IT UP. 
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU WITH THAT 
IN A SECOND. 
I AM THRILLED THAT HE ACCEPTED 
THE OFFER TO COME AND ACCEPT AN 
AWARD FROM THE INSTITUTE OF 
GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS, 
AN AWARD THAT HONORS THE 
INTEGRITY AND ETHICAL STANDARDS 
THAT HAVE GUIDED HIS LIFETIME 
OF PUBLIC SERVICE. 
AND I'M DEEPLY GRATEFUL THAT HE 
IS USING THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
SHARE HIS UNIQUE INSIGHTS WITH 
US, WITH STUDENTS FROM ACROSS 
THE SYSTEM WHO ARE HERE AND THE 
THOUSANDS MORE WHO ARE WATCHING 
THE LIVE STREAM ONLINE. 
WELCOME TO YOU ALL. 
LET'S HEAR FROM EACH OF THE 
UNIVERSITIES.

SPRINGFIELD.

WILL ALL OF YOU AT CHICAGO STAND
BRIEFLY AND LET YOUR PRESENCE 
BE KNOWN. 
 AND WILL ALL THE 
STUDENTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF 
ILLINOIS AT CHAMPAIGN STAND UP 
AND LET YOUR PRESENCE BE KNOWN. 
 IT IS MY GREAT 
PLEASURE TO TURN THE PODIUM 
OVER TO ONE OF YOUR OWN. HE HAS 
THE HONOR OF INTRODUCING THE 
SPECIAL GAS. 
HE IS A SENIOR HERE, A CHICAGO 
NATIVE, MAJORING IN INDUSTRIAL 
DESIGN. 
HIS STORY REFLECTS THE POWER OF 
AN EDUCATION. 
I HOPE YOU ALL JOIN ME IN 
WELCOMING HIM. 
 
>> GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. 
MY NAME IS AMARI  SAULSBERRY. 
I ASPIRE TO BE ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST NAMES IN THE 
ENTREPRENEURIAL WORLD. 
I WAS BORN AND RAISED ON THE 
SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO IN A 
NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED -- GROWING 
UP ON THE SELL SIDE, I HAVE 
SEEN AND FACED IN OF CHALLENGES 
THAT WOULD WE CAN ANYONE AT MY 
AGE. 
-- WEAKEN ANYONE AT MY AGE. 
DID THE OPPOSITE FOR ME. 
ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO, I STARTED MY 
OWN COMPANY WHERE WE CREATE 
SMART PACIFIERS THAT CAN DETECT 
EARLY SIGNS OF ILLNESSES IN 
BABIES. 
THE ROAD TO MY SOMETHING BIG 
WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE 
UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS. 
EVERYONE KNOWS WHEN YOU COME TO 
ILLINOIS, YOU ARE GOING TO 
LEAVE HERE WITH A DEGREE THAT 
MEANS SOMETHING. 
ANOTHER THING ILLINOIS TEACHES 
YOU IS THAT ONE PERSON REALLY 
CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. 
AND WHEN YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLES 
OF ONE PERSON CHANGING THE 
WORLD, FOR ME AND PROBABLY 
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM YOU LOOK 
TO BARACK OBAMA. 
 WHEN HE WAS FIRST 
ELECTED IN 2008, I WAS 11 YEARS 
OLD. 
I KNEW IT WAS A BIG DEAL. 
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL HIGH SCHOOL 
AND COLLEGE WHEN I BEGAN TO 
REALIZE HOW BIG OF A DEAL IT 
WAS. 
THAT'S WHEN I STARTED TO 
UNDERSTAND THE MOST IMPORTANT 
STEPS TO HIS ELECTION STARTED 
WAY BEFORE ANYBODY KNEW HIS 
NAME. 
THAT'S ALSO WHEN I CAME TO 
UNDERSTAND THAT HIS ROAD TO 
BECOMING THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES STARTED WITH HIS 
PERSONAL DECISION TO MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE IN HIS COMMUNITY. 
HE MADE A CHOICE TO USE HIS 
GIFTS AND HIS LIFE TO EMPOWER 
OTHERS AROUND HIM. 
BARACK OBAMA STARTED HIS CAREER 
IN CHICAGO. HE LANDED A SEAT IN 
THE U.S. SENATE. 
IT LED TO HIS INAUGURATION AS 
THE 44th PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
AND THE MOST EXCITING PART FOR 
ALL OF US SITTING HERE RIGHT 
NOW IS THAT IT LED HIM TO THE 
STAGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
ILLINOIS TODAY. 
  WHEN 
YOU APPLY TO ILLINOIS, THEY 
TELL YOU THIS PLACE IS GOING TO 
OPEN UP DOORS TO BIG 
OPPORTUNITIES. 
AS A STUDENT STANDING ON THE 
STAGE INTRODUCING FORMER U.S. 
PRESIDENT, I CAN TELL YOU THAT 
IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. 
 
IT IS MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE AND 
WELCOME PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. 
 
>> HELLO, ILLINOIS. 
HELLO. 
ILO! 
ILO! 
ILO! 
OKAY, OKAY. 
I'M JUST CHECKING TO SEE IF YOU 
ARE AWAKE. 
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY. 
IT IS GOOD TO BE HOME. 
 IT IS GOOD TO SEE 
CORN. 
BEANS. 
I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN 
SOMEBODY AS WERE FLYING IN, 
THAT IS CORN. 
 THAT ARE BEANS. 
THEY WERE VERY IMPRESSED. 
AT MY AGRICULTURAL KNOWLEDGE. 
PLEASE GIVE IT UP FOR AMAURY  
ONCE AGAIN FOR THAT OUTSTANDING 
INTRODUCTION. 
 I HAVE A BUNCH OF 
GOOD FRIENDS HERE TODAY 
INCLUDING SOMEBODY WHO I SERVED 
WITH, WHO IS ONE OF THE FINEST 
SENATORS IN THE COUNTRY, AND WE 
ARE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM. 
YOUR SENATOR, DICK DURBIN IS 
HERE. 
 I ALSO NOTICED BY 
THE WAY, FORMER GOVERNOR EDGAR 
HERE. 
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN A LONG 
TIME. 
HE HAS NOT AGED AND SOMEHOW I 
HAVE. 
IT IS GREAT TO SEE HIM AGAIN. 
 I WANT TO THANK 
THE PRESIDENT AND EVERYBODY AT 
THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS 
SYSTEM FOR MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR 
ME TO BE HERE TODAY. 
I'M DEEPLY HONORED AT THE PAUL 
DOUGLAS AWARD THAT IS BEING 
GIVEN TO ME. 
HE IS SOMEBODY WHO SET THE PATH 
FOR SO MUCH OUTSTANDING PUBLIC 
SERVICE HERE IN ILLINOIS. 
NOW, I WANT TO START BY 
ADDRESSING THE ELEPHANT IN THE 
ROOM. 
I KNOW PEOPLE ARE STILL 
WONDERING WHY I DIDN'T SPEAK AT 
THE 2017 COMMENCEMENT. 
 THE STUDENT BODY 
PRESIDENT SENT A VERY 
THOUGHTFUL INVITATION. STUDENTS 
MADE A SPIFFY VIDEO. AND WHEN I 
DECLINED, I HEAR THERE WAS 
SPECULATION THAT I WAS 
BOYCOTTING CAMPUS UNTIL 
ANTONIO'S PIZZA REOPENED. 
 SO I WANT TO BE 
CLEAR, I DID NOT TAKE SIDES IN 
THAT LATE NIGHT FOOD DEBATE. 
THE TRUTH IS, AFTER 8 YEARS IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE I NEEDED TO 
SPEND SOME TIME ONE-ON-ONE WITH 
MICHELLE. -- IF I WANTED TO 
STAY MARRIED. 
AND SHE SAYS HELLO, BY THE WAY. 
I ALSO WANTED TO SPEND SOME 
QUALITY TIME WITH MY DAUGHTERS 
WHO WERE SUDDENLY YOUNG WOMEN 
ON THEIR WAY OUT THE DOOR. 
AND I SHOULD ADD BY THE WAY, 
NOW THAT I HAVE A DAUGHTER IN 
COLLEGE, I CAN TELL ALL THE 
STUDENTS HERE YOUR PARENTS 
SUFFER.  THEY CRY 
PRIVATELY. IT IS BRUTAL. 
SO PLEASE, CALL. 
SEND A TEXT. 
 
WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU. 
JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING. 
AND THE TRUTH WAS, I WAS ALSO 
INTENT ON FOLLOWING A WISE 
AMERICAN TRADITION OF EX-
PRESIDENTS GRACEFULLY EXITING 
THE POLITICAL STAGE AND MAKING 
ROOM FOR NEW VOICES AND NEW 
IDEAS. 
AND WE HAVE OUR FIRST 
PRESIDENT, GEORGE WASHINGTON TO 
THINK FOR SETTING THAT -- THANK 
FOR SETTING THAT EXAMPLE. 
THERE WERE NO CONSTRAINTS 
REALLY. 
HE WAS PRACTICALLY A GOD TO 
THOSE WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM INTO 
BATTLE. 
THERE WAS NO CONSTITUTION. 
THERE WERE NO DEMOCRATIC NORMS 
THAT GUIDED WHAT YOU SHOULD OR 
COULD DO. 
AND HE COULD HAVE MADE HIMSELF 
ALL-POWERFUL. 
HE COULD'VE MADE HIMSELF 
POTENTIALLY PRESIDENT FOR LIFE. 
INSTEAD, HE RESIGNED AS 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND MOVED 
BACK TO HIS COUNTRY ESTATE. 
6 YEARS LATER, HE WAS ELECTED 
PRESIDENT. 
BUT AFTER TWO TERMS, HE 
RESIGNED AGAIN. 
HE WENT OFF INTO THE SUNSET. 
THE POINT WASHINGTON MADE, THE 
POINT THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO 
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS THAT IN A 
GOVERNMENT OF AND BY AND FOR 
THE PEOPLE, THERE SHOULD BE NO 
PERMANENT RULING CLASS. 
THEY ARE ONLY CITIZENS WHO ARE 
TEMPORARY REPRESENTATIVES AND 
DETERMINE OUR COURSE AND 
DETERMINE OUR CHARACTER. 
I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE THIS IS 
ONE OF THOSE PIVOTAL MOMENTS 
ONE EVERYONE OF US, AS CITIZENS 
OF THE UNITED STATES NEED TO 
DETERMINE JUST WHO IT IS THAT 
WE ARE. 
JUST WHAT IT IS THAT WE STAND 
FOR. 
AND AS A FELLOW CITIZEN, NOT AS 
AN EX-PRESIDENT BUT AS A 
CITIZEN, I'M HERE TO DELIVER 
SIMPLE MESSAGE AND THAT IS THAT 
YOU NEED TO VOTE BECAUSE 
DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON IT. 
 
NOW, SOME OF YOU MAY THINK I AM 
EXAGGERATING WHEN I SAY THIS 
ELECTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN 
ANY I CAN REMEMBER IN MY 
LIFETIME. 
I KNOW POLITICIANS SAY THAT ALL 
THE TIME. 
I HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF SING IT A 
FEW TIMES, PARTICULARLY WHEN I 
WAS ON THE BALLOT. 
 BUT JUST A GLANCE 
AT RECENT HEADLINES SHOULD TELL 
YOU THAT THIS MOMENT REALLY IS 
DIFFERENT. 
THE STAKES REALLY ARE HIGHER. 
THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY OF US 
SITTING ON THE SIDELINES ARE 
MORE DIRE. 
AND IT ISN'T AS IF WE HAVEN'T 
HAD BIG ELECTIONS BEFORE OR BIG 
CHOICES TO MAKE IN OUR HISTORY. 
THE FACT IS, DEMOCRACY HAS 
NEVER BEEN EASY AND FOUNDING 
FATHERS ARGUED ABOUT EVERYTHING.
WE WAGED A CIVIL WAR. WE 
OVERCAME DEPRESSION. WE HAVE 
LURCHED FROM ARROWS OF GREAT 
AGGRESSIVE CHANGE TO PERIODS OF 
RETRENCHMENT. 
STILL, MOST AMERICANS ALIVE 
TODAY, CERTAINLY THE STUDENTS 
WERE HERE, HAVE OPERATED UNDER 
SOME COMMON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT 
WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE STAND 
FOR. 
OUT OF THE TURMOIL OF THE 
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND THE 
GREAT DEPRESSION, AMERICAN -- 
AMERICA ADOPTED A NEW ECONOMY. 
GUIDING THE FREE MARKET, WITH 
REGULATIONS TO PROTECT HEALTH 
AND SAFETY AND FAIR PETITION, 
EMPOWERING WORKERS WITH UNION 
MOVEMENTS, INVESTING IN SCIENCE 
AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE U 
OF I.  AND STITCHING TOGETHER A 
SOCIAL SAFETY NET. 
AND ALL OF THIS LED TO 
UNRIVALED PROSPERITY. 
AND THE RISE OF A BROAD AND 
DEEP MIDDLE-CLASS. 
IN THE SENSE THAT IF YOU WORKED 
HARD, YOU COULD CLIMB THE LADDER
OF SUCCESS. 
NOW NOT EVERYBODY WAS INCLUDED 
IN THIS PROSPERITY. 
THERE IS A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. 
END ZONE RESPONSE TO THE STAIN 
OF SLAVERY, AND SEGREGATION, 
AND THE REALITY OF RACIAL 
DISCRIMINATION, THE CIVIL 
RIGHTS MOVEMENT NOT ONLY OPENED 
NEW DOORS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS 
BUT ALSO OPENED UP THE 
FLOODGATES OF OPPORTUNITY FOR 
WOMEN AND AMERICANS WITH 
DISABILITIES AND LGBT AMERICANS
, OTHERS TO MAKE THEIR OWN 
CLAIMS TO FULL AND EQUAL 
CITIZENSHIP. 
AND ALTHOUGH DISCRIMINATION 
REMAINED A PERNICIOUS FORCE IN 
SOCIETY, AND CONTINUES TO THIS 
DAY, AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 
CONTROVERSIES ABOUT HOW TO BEST 
ENSURE GENUINE EQUALITY OF 
OPPORTUNITY, THERE HAS BEEN AT 
LEAST ROUGH AGREEMENT AMONG THE 
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF 
AMERICA'S THAT THE COUNTRY'S 
STRONGEST -- AMERICA IS THE 
COUNTRY IS THE STRONGEST WHEN 
EVERYBODY IS TREATED FAIRLY. 
WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED ON YOUR 
CHARACTER, AND NOT THE COLOR OF 
YOUR SKIN OR THE WAY IN WHICH 
THEY WORSHIP GOD OR THEIR LAST 
NAMES. 
AND THEN THAT EXTENDED BEYOND 
THE BORDERS AND FROM THE 
WRECKAGE OF WORLD WAR II WOULD 
BUILT A POSTWAR WEB, SYSTEM OF 
ALLIANCES AND INSTITUTIONS TO 
OPPOSE SOVIET TOTALITARIANISM 
AND TO HELP POOR COUNTRIES 
DEVELOP. AND AMERICAN 
LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE GLOBE 
WASN'T PERFECT. 
WE MADE MISTAKES AT TIMES, WE 
LOST SIGHT OF IDEALS. WE HAD 
FIERCE ARGUMENTS ABOUT VIETNAM 
AND FIERCE ARGUMENTS ABOUT IRAQ.
BUT THANKS TO LEADERSHIP, A 
BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP, AND THE 
EFFORTS OF DIPLOMATS, AND PEACE 
CORPS VOLUNTEERS, AND MOST ALL 
THE SACRIFICES OF THE MEN AND 
WOMEN IN UNIFORM, RE-REDUCED 
THE PROSPECTS OF FOUR BETWEEN 
THE GREAT POWERS -- WAR BETWEEN 
THE GREAT POWERS, WE WON THE 
COLD WAR, WE HELPED SPREAD A 
COMMITMENT TO CERTAIN VALUES 
AND PRINCIPLES LIKE THE RULE OF 
LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
DEMOCRACY. 
AND THE NOTION OF THE INHERENT 
DIGNITY AND WORTH OF EVERY 
INDIVIDUAL. AND EVEN THOSE 
COUNTRIES THAT DIDN'T ABIDE BY 
THOSE PRINCIPLES, WERE STILL 
SUBJECT TO SHAME AND STILL HAD 
TO AT LEAST GIVE LIP SERVICE TO 
THE IDEA. AND THAT PROVIDED A 
LEVER TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE 
THE PROSPECTS FOR PEOPLE AROUND 
THE WORLD. 
THAT'S THE STORY OF AMERICA. 
A STORY OF PROGRESS, FITFUL 
PROGRESS, INCOMPLETE PROGRESS, 
BUT PROGRESS. 
AND THAT PROGRESS WASN'T 
ACHIEVED BY JUST A HANDFUL OF 
FAMOUS LEADERS MAKING SPEECHES. 
IT WAS WON BECAUSE OF COUNTLESS 
QUIET ACTS OF HEROISM AND 
DEDICATION, BY CITIZENS, BY 
ORDINARY PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM 
NOT MUCH OLDER THAN YOU. 
IT WAS WON BECAUSE RATHER THAN 
BE BYSTANDERS TO HISTORY, 
ORDINARY PEOPLE THOUGHT AND 
MARCHED AND MOBILIZED AND BUILT 
AND, YES, VOTED TO MAKE HISTORY.
OF COURSE, THERE IS ALWAYS 
ANOTHER DARKER ASPECT TO 
AMERICA'S STORY. 
PROGRESS DOESN'T JUST MOVE IN A 
STRAIGHT LINE. 
THERE IS A REASON WHY PROGRESS 
HASN'T BEEN EASY. 
AND WHY THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY, 
EVERY TWO STEPS FORWARD, SEEMS 
TO SOMETIMESPRODUCE ONE STEP 
BACK. 
EACH TIME WE PULL OURSELVES 
CLOSER TO OUR FOUNDING IDEAS, 
THAT ALL OF US ARE CREATED 
EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THE CREATOR 
WITH CERTAIN RIGHTS, THE IDEALS 
THAT SAY EVERY CHILD SHOULD 
HAVE OPPORTUNITY, AND EVERY MAN 
AND WOMAN WHO IS WILLING TO 
WORK HARD SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
FIND A JOB AND SUPPORT THEIR 
FAMILY AND HAVE A SMALL PIECE 
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM, THE 
IDEALS THAT SAY WE HAVE A 
COLLECTIVE RESPONSE ABILITY TO 
CARE FOR THE SICK, AND WE HAVE 
A RESPONSIBILITY TO CONSERVE 
THE AMAZING BOUNTY, THE NATURAL 
RESOURCES OF THIS COUNTRY, AND 
OF THIS PLANET. 
EACH TIME WE'VE GOTTEN CLOSER 
TO THOSE IDEALS, SOMEBODY 
SOMEWHERE HAS PUSHED BACK. 
THE STATUS QUO PUSHES BACK. 
SOMETIMES THE BACKLASH COMES 
FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE GENUINELY, 
IF WRONGLY, FEARFUL OF CHANGE. 
MORE OFTEN IT IS MANUFACTURED 
BY THE POWERFUL AND THE 
PRIVILEGED WHO WANT TO KEEP US 
DIVIDED AND KEEP US ANGRY AND 
KEEP US CYNICAL BECAUSE THAT 
HELPS THEM MAINTAIN THE STATUS 
QUO. 
AND KEEP THEIR POWER. 
AND KEEP THEIR PRIVILEGE. 
AND YOU HAPPEN TO BE COMING-OF-
AGE DURING ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS.
IT DID NOT START WITH DONALD 
TRUMP. 
HE IS A SYMPTOM, NOT THE CAUSE. 
 
HE IS JUST CAPITALIZING ON 
RESENTMENTS THAT POLITICIANS 
HAVE BEEN PENDING FOR YEARS. 
A FEAR AND ANGER THAT IS ROOTED 
IN THE PAST BUT ALSO BORN OUT 
OF THE ENORMOUS OF PEOPLE'S 
THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE -- 
UPHEAVALS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE 
IN YOUR BRIEF LIFETIMES. 
BY THE TIME -- BY THE WAY, IT 
WAS BRIEF. 
WHEN I HEARD THAT MARK D'AMICO  
WAS 11 WHEN I WAS ELECTED. 
AND NOW HE IS STARTING A 
COMPANY. 
THAT WAS YESTERDAY. 
 BUT THINK ABOUT IT,
YOU HAVE COME OF AGE IN A 
SMALLER, MORE CONNECTED WORLD 
WHERE DEMOCRATIC SHIFTS HAVE 
SCRAMBLED NOT ONLY TRADITIONAL 
ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENTS BUT OUR 
SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS AND OUR 
RELIGIOUS COMMITMENTS AND OUR 
CIVIC INSTITUTIONS. 
MOST OF YOU DON'T REMEMBER A 
TIME BEFORE 9/11. 
WHEN HE DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE A 
FEW SHOWS AT AN AIRPORT. 
-- SHOES AT AN AIRPORT. 
MOST OF YOU DON'T REMEMBER A 
TIME WHEN AMERICA WASN'T AT 
WAR. 
OR WHEN MONEY AND IMAGES AND 
INFORMATION TO TRAVEL INSTANTLY 
AROUND THE GLOBE. 
OR WHEN THE CLIMATE WASN'T 
CHANGING FASTER THAN OUR 
EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IT. 
THIS CHANGE HAS HAPPENED FAST. 
FASTER THAN ANY TIME IN HUMAN 
HISTORY. 
AND IT CREATED A NEW ECONOMY 
THAT HAS UNLEASHED INCREDIBLE 
PROSPERITY BUT IT HAS ALSO 
UPENDED LIVES IN PROFOUND WAYS. 
FOR THOSE WITH UNIQUE SKILLS, 
OR ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND 
CAPITAL, A GLOBAL MARKET HAS 
MEANT UNPRECEDENTED WEALTH. 
FOR THOSE NOT SO LUCKY, FOR THE 
FACTORY WORKER, THE OFFICE 
WORKER, OR EVEN MIDDLE MANAGERS,
THOSE SAME FORCES MAY HAVE 
WIPED YOUR JOB OR AT LEAST PUT 
YOU IN NOW POSITION TO ASK FOR 
A RAISE. 
AND AS WAGES SLOWED AND 
INEQUALITY ACCELERATED, THOSE 
AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID HAVE 
INFLUENCED GOVERNMENT TO SKEW 
THINGS EVEN MORE IN THEIR 
DIRECTION. 
CUTTING TAXES ON THE WEALTHIEST 
AMERICANS, ON WIDENING 
REGULATIONS AND WEAKENING 
PROTECTIONS. 
SHRINKING THE SAFETY NET. 
SO, YOU HAVE COME OF AGE DURING 
A TIME OF GROWING INEQUALITY, 
FRACTURING OF ECONOMIC 
OPPORTUNITY. 
AND THAT GROWING ECONOMIC DIVIDE
COMPOUNDED OTHER DIVISIONS IN 
THE COUNTRY. 
REGIONAL, RACIAL, RELIGIOUS, 
CULTURAL. IT MADE IT HARDER TO 
BUILD CONSENSUS ON ISSUES. 
IT MADE POLITICIANS LESS 
WILLING TO COMPROMISE. 
WHICH INCREASED GRIDLOCK, WHICH 
MADE PEOPLE EVEN MORE CYNICAL 
ABOUT POLITICS. AND THEN THE 
RECKLESS BEHAVIOR OF FINANCIAL 
ELITES TRIGGERED A MASSIVE 
FINANCIAL CRISIS. 10 YEARS AGO 
THIS WEEK, A CRISIS THAT 
RESULTED IN THE WORST RECESSION 
IN ANY OF OUR LIFETIMES AND 
CAUSED YEARS OF HARDSHIP FOR 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
FOR MANY OF YOUR PARENTS, FOR 
MANY OF YOUR FAMILIES -- MOST 
OF YOU WEREN'T OLD ENOUGH TO 
FULLY FOCUS ON WHAT WAS GOING 
ON AT THE TIME. 
BUT WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE IN 
2009, WE WERE LOSING 800,000 
JOBS A MONTH. 
800,000. 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WERE LOSING 
HOMES. 
MANY WERE WORRIED WE WERE 
ENTERING INTO A SECOND GREAT 
DEPRESSION. 
SO WE WORKED HARD TO END THAT 
CRISIS BUT ALSO TO BREAK SOME 
OF THESE LONGER TERM TRENDS. 
THE ACTIONS WE TOOK DURING THAT 
CRAISINS -- CRISIS RETURN TO 
GROWTH. 
IT INITIATED THE LONGEST STREAK 
OF JOB CREATION ON RECORD. 
AND WE COVERED ANOTHER 20 
MILLION AMERICANS WITH HEALTH 
INSURANCE AND CUT DEFICITS BY 
MORE THAN HALF IMMEDIATELY BY 
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME 
WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN SUCH 
AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES I THIS 
COUNTRY, PAY OUR FAIR SHARE OF 
-- BY THIS COUNTRY, PAY OUR 
FAIR SHARE OF TAXES TO HELP 
PEOPLE COMING UP BEHIND US. 
 AND BY THE TIME I 
LEFT OFFICE, HOUSEHOLD INCOME 
WAS NEAR AN ALL-TIME HIGH AND 
THE UNINSURED RATE HIT AN ALL-
TIME LOW. 
WAGES WERE RISING, POVERTY 
RATES WERE FALLING. 
I MENTION THIS SO WHEN YOU HEAR 
HOW GREAT THE ECONOMY IS DOING 
RIGHT NOW, LET'S JUST REMEMBER 
WHEN THIS RECOVERY STARTED. 
 
I MEAN, I'M GLAD IT HAS 
CONTINUED BUT WHEN YOU HEAR 
ABOUT THIS ECONOMIC MIRACLE 
THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON, WHEN 
THE JOB NUMBERS COME OUT, 
MONTHLY JOB NUMBERS, SUDDENLY 
REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING IT IS A 
MIRACLE. 
I HAVE TO KIND OF REMIND THEM, 
ACTUALLY, THOSE JOB NUMBERS ARE 
THE SAME AS THEY WERE IN 2015. 
AND 2016. 
 ANYWAY, I DIGRESS. 
  SO WE 
MADE PROGRESS BUT -- AND THIS 
IS THE TRUTH, MY ADMINISTRATION 
COULDN'T REVERSE FORTY-YEAR 
TRENDS IN ONLY 8 YEARS. 
ESPECIALLY ONCE REPUBLICANS 
TOOK OVER THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES IN 2010 AND 
DECIDED TO BLOCK EVERYTHING WE 
DID. 
EVEN THINGS THEY USED TO SUPPORT
, SO WE PULLED THE ECONOMY OUT 
OF CRISIS. BUT TO THIS DAY, TOO 
MANY PEOPLE WHO ONCE FELT 
SOLIDLY MIDDLE-CLASS STILL FEEL 
VERY REAL. 
AND VERY PERSONAL ECONOMIC 
INSECURITY. 
EVEN THOUGH WE TOOK OUT OSAMA 
BIN LADEN AND TOOK DOWN THE 
WARS IN IRAQ AND GOT IRAN TO 
HALT THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. 
WORLD IS STILL FULL OF THREATS. 
THEY COME STREAMING THROUGH THE 
TELEVISION EVERY DAY. 
AND THE CHALLENGES GET PEOPLE 
WORRIED AND IT PHRASE OUR CIVIL 
-- FRAYS OUR CIVIL TRUST. 
AND IT FEELS LIKE THE GAME IS 
RIGGED. 
AND NOBODY IS LOOKING OUT FOR 
THEM. 
ESPECIALLY THOSE COMMUNITIES 
OUTSIDE THE BIG URBAN CENTERS. 
AND EVEN THOUGH YOUR GENERATION 
IS THE MOST DIVERSE IN HISTORY, 
WITH A GREATER ACCEPTANCE AND 
CELEBRATION OF OUR DIFFERENCES 
THAN EVER BEFORE, THOSE ARE THE 
KINDS OF CONDITIONS THAT ARE 
RIGHT FOR EXPLOITATION BY 
POLITICIANS WHO HAVE NO 
COMPUNCTION AND NO SHAME ABOUT 
TAPPING INTO AMERICA'S DARK 
HISTORY OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC 
AND RELIGIOUS DIVISION. 
APPEALING TO TRIBE, APPEALING 
TO FEAR, PUTTING ONE GROUP 
ANNOUNCED -- AGAINST ANOTHER, 
TELLING PEOPLE THAT ORDER AND 
SECURITY WILL BE RESTORED IF IT 
WEREN'T FOR THOSE WHO DON'T 
LOOK LIKE US OR DON'T SOUND 
LIKE US OR DON'T PRAY LIKE WE DO
, THAT'S AN OLD PLAYBOOK. 
IT'S AS OLD AS TIME. 
AND IN A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY, IT 
DOES NOT WORK. 
OUR ANTIBODIES KICK IN. AND 
PEOPLE OF GOODWILL FROM ACROSS 
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM CALLOUT 
BIGOTS AND THE FEARMONGER'S AND 
WORK TO COMPROMISE AND GET 
THINGS DONE. 
AND PROMOTE THE BETTER AGES OF 
THE NATURE -- NATION. 
BUT WHEN THERE IS A VACUUM IN 
THE DEMOCRACY, WHEN WE DON'T 
VOTE, WHEN WE TAKE OUR BASIC 
RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS FOR GRANTED,
WHEN WE TURN AWAY AND STOP 
PAYING ATTENTION, AND STOP 
ENGAGING, AND STOP BELIEVING, 
AND LOOK FOR THE NEWEST 
DIVERSION, THE ELECTRONIC 
VERSIONS OF CIRCUSES, THEN 
OTHER VOICES FILL THAT VOID. 
POLITICS OF FEAR AND RESENTMENT 
AND ENTRENCHMENT TAKES HOLD. 
THEY PROMISE SIMPLE FIXES TO 
COMPLEX ALBUMS. 
NOW PROMISED TO FIGHT FOR THE 
-- PROBLEMS. 
NOW PROMISED TO FIGHT FOR THE 
LITTLE GUY. 
NO PROMISE TO CLEAN UP 
CORRUPTION. 
AND THEN PLUNDER AWAY. THEY 
START UNDERMINING NORMS THAT 
ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRY 
TO CHANGE THE RULES TO ENTRENCH 
THEIR POWER FURTHER. 
AND THEY APPEAL TO RACIAL 
NATIONALISM. SOUND FAMILIAR? 
I UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT JUST A 
MATTER OF DAMS VERSUS -- 
DEMOCRATS VERSUS REPUBLICANS. 
AT VARIOUS TIMES, THIS HAS 
INFECTED BOTH PARTIES. SOUTHERN 
DEMOCRATS WERE THE BIGGER 
DEFENDERS OF SLAVERY. 
IT TO REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, 
NEIGHBORHOOD -- ABRAHAM 
LINCOLN, TO END IT. 
THEY POSED THE IDEA OF 
EXPANDING CIVIL RIGHTS. 
AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS A 
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT AND A 
MAJORITY CONGRESS SPURRED BY 
YOUNG MARCHERS AND PROTESTERS 
THAT GOT THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT 
OVER THE FINISH LINE, THOSE 
HISTORIC LAWS ALSO GOT PASSED 
BECAUSE OF THE LEADERSHIP OF 
REPUBLICANS, LIKE ILLINOIS OWN 
EVERETT DIRKSEN. 
SO NEITHER PARTY HAS HAD A 
MONOPOLY ON WISDOM. 
NEITHER PARTY HAS BEEN 
EXCLUSIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR US 
GOING BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF 
FORWARDS. 
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS, BECAUSE 
SOMETIMES WE HEAR I'M PLAYING 
ON BOTH HOUSES. 
OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES, IT 
WASN'T TRUE ONE JIM EGGER WAS 
GOVERNOR HERE IN ILLINOIS. 
OR JIM THOMPSON WAS GOVERNOR. I 
HAVE A LOT OF GOOD REPUBLICAN 
FRIENDS HERE IN ILLINOIS. 
THE POLITICS OF DIVISION AND 
PARANOIA HAS FOUND A HOME, 
UNFORTUNATELY, IN THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
THIS CONGRESS HAS CHAMPIONED 
THE UNWINDING OF CAMPAIGN 
FINANCE LAWS TO GIVE 
BILLIONAIRES INFLUENCE ON 
POLITICS. 
SYSTEMATICALLY ATTACKING VOTING 
RIGHTS TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR 
YOUNG PEOPLE, AND MY UNDIES, -- 
AND MINORITIES, AND THE POOR TO 
VOTE. 
LEFT THE ./-- SLASH 
THE SAFETY NET WHERE YOU CAN. 
EMBRACE WILD CONSPIRACY THEORIES
BY THOSE SURROUNDING BENGHAZI. 
OR MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE. 
 REJECTED SCIENCE, 
REJECTED FAX ON THINGS LIKE 
CLIMATE CHANGE. 
EMBRACED A RISING ABSOLUTISM 
FROM MY WILLINGNESS TO DEFAULT 
ON AMERICA'S DEBT BY NOT PAYING 
OUR PILLS TO REFUSAL TO EVEN 
MEET -- BILLS TO REFUSAL TO 
EVEN MEET A QUALIFIED NOMINEE 
FOR THE SUPREME COURT. NONE OF 
THIS IS CONSERVATIVE. 
I DON'T MEAN TO PRETEND I'M 
CHANNELING ABRAHAM LINCOLN NOW 
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE HAD IN 
MIND. 
I THINK, WHEN HE HELPED FORM 
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT IS NOT 
CONSERVATIVE, IT SURE ISN'T 
NORMAL. 
IT'S RADICAL. 
IT'S A VISION THAT SAYS THE 
PROTECTION OF OUR POWER AND 
THOSE WHO BACK US IS ALL THAT 
MATTERS EVEN WHEN IT HURTS THE 
COUNTRY. 
IT'S A VISION THAT SAYS THE FEW 
WHO CAN AFFORD HIGH-PRICED 
LOBBYISTS SET THE AGENDA. AND 
OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS, THIS 
VISION IS NOW NEARING ITS 
LOGICAL CONCLUSION. 
SO THAT WITH REPUBLICANS IN 
CONTROL OF CONGRESS, WITHOUT 
ANY CHECKS OR BALANCES 
WHATSOEVER, THEY HAVE PROVIDED 
ANOTHER $1.5 TRILLION IN TAX 
CUTS TO PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO, I 
PROMISE, DON'T NEED IT. 
AND DON'T EVEN PRETEND TO PAY 
FOR THEM. 
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PARTY 
OF FISCAL CONSERVATIVES HIM -- 
CONSERVATISM. 
WHEN THE DEFICIT WAS LOWER, 
THEY SAID I COULDN'T AFFORD TO 
HELP WORKING FAMILIES OR 
SENIORS ON MEDICARE BUS -- 
BECAUSE IT WAS A CRISIS. 
WHAT CHANGED? 
 WHAT CHANGED? 
THEY ARE SUBSIDIZING CORPORATE 
POLLUTERS WITH TAXPAYER 
DOLLARS. 
ALLOWING DISHONEST LENDERS TO 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VETERANS AND 
CONSUMERS AGAIN. 
THEY HAVE MADE IT SO THAT THE 
ONLY NATION ON EARTH TO PULL OUT
OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AGREEMENT
, IT'S NOT NORTH KOREA, IT'S 
NOT SYRIAC, IT'S NOT RUSSIA OR 
SAUDI ARABIA, IT IS US. 
THE ONLY COUNTRY. THERE ARE A 
LOT OF COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. 
WE ARE THE ONLY ONES. 
 
THEY ARE UNDERMINING ALLIANCES. 
COZYING UP TO RUSSIA. 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY? 
IT IS CENTRAL ORGANIZING 
PRINCIPLE IN FOREIGN POLICY. 
WAS THE FIGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM 
AND NOW THEY ARE CLOSING UP TO 
THE FORMER HEAD OF THE KGB. 
ACTIVELY BLOCKING LEGISLATION 
THAT WOULD DEFEND OUR ELECTIONS 
FROM RUSSIAN ATTACK. 
WHAT HAPPENED? 
THEY ARE SABOTAGING THE 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 
IT IS ALREADY COST MORE THAN 
300 -- 3 MILLION AMERICANS THEIR
INSURANCE. 
IF THEY ARE STILL IN POWER NEXT 
FALL, YOU BETTER BELIEVE THEY 
ARE COMING AT IT AGAIN. 
THEY HAVE SAID SO. 
IN A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY, THERE 
ARE SUMS -- SOME CHECKS AND 
BALANCES ON THIS BEHAVIOR, THIS 
INCONSISTENCY. BUT RIGHT NOW 
THERE IS NOTHING. 
REPUBLICANS WHO KNOW BETTER -- 
AND THEY ARE THERE, THEY ARE 
QUOTED SAYING WE KNOW THIS IS 
KIND OF CRAZY. THEY ARE STILL 
BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO 
SHIELD THIS BEHAVIOR FROM 
SCRUTINY OR ACCOUNTABILITY OR 
CONSEQUENCE. 
THEY SEEM UNWILLING TO FIND THE 
BACKBONE TO SAFEGUARD THE 
INSTITUTION THAT MAKE THE 
DEMOCRACY WORK. 
AND BY THE WAY, THE CLAIM THAT 
EVERYTHING WILL TURN OUT OKAY 
BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE INSIDE 
THE WHITE HOUSE WHO SECRETLY 
EARNED FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT'S
ORDERS, THAT IS NOT A CHECK. 
I'M BEING SERIOUS HERE. 
THAT IS NOT HOW DEMOCRACY IS 
SUPPOSED TO WORK. 
 THESE PEOPLE ARE 
NOT ELECTED. 
THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE. 
THEY ARE NOT DOING US A SERVICE 
BY ACTIVELY PROMOTING 90% OF 
THE CRAZY STUFF THAT IS COMING 
OUT OF THIS WHITE HOUSE. 
AND THEN SING, DON'T WORRY. 
WE ARE PREVENTING THE OTHER 10%.
THAT'S NOT HOW THINGS ARE 
SUPPOSED TO WORK. 
THIS IS NOT NORMAL. 
SO THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY 
TIMES. 
AND THEY ARE DANGEROUS TIMES. 
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS, IN 
TWO MONTHS, WE HAVE THE CHANCE, 
NOT THE CERTAINTY, BUT THE 
CHANCE TO RESTORE SOME 
SEMBLANCE OF SIMILE -- SANITY 
TO POLITICS. 
 BECAUSE THERE IS 
ACTUALLY ONLY ONE REAL CHECK ON 
BAD POLICY AND ABUSES OF POWER, 
AND THAT IS YOU. 
YOU AND YOUR VOTE. 
LOOK, AMERICANS WILL ALWAYS HAVE
DISAGREEMENTS ON POLICY. 
THIS IS A BIG COUNTRY. 
IT IS A RAUCOUS COUNTRY. 
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT POINTS OF 
VIEW. 
I HAPPEN TO BE A DEMOCRAT. 
I SUPPORT DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES.
I BELIEVE OUR POLICIES ARE 
BETTER AND THAT WE HAVE A 
BIGGER, OLDER VISION OF 
OPPORTUNITY AND EQUALITY 
INJUSTICE AND INCLUSIVE 
DEMOCRACY. 
WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF JOBS 
YOUNG PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING A 
CHANCE TO OCCUPY OR AREN'T 
GETTING PAID ENOUGH OR AREN'T 
GETTING BENEFITS LIKE INSURANCE
. IT IS HARDER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
TO SAVE FOR A RAINY DAY, LET 
ALONE RETIREMENT. 
SO DEMOCRATS AREN'T JUST 
RUNNING ON GOOD OLD IDEA LIKE A 
HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE. 
THEY ARE RUNNING ON GOOD NEW 
IDEAS LIKE MEDICARE FOR ALL. 
GIVING WORKER SEATS ON 
CORPORATE BOARDS. 
REVERSING THE MOST EGREGIOUS 
CORPORATE TAX CUTS TO MAKE SURE 
COLLEGE STUDENTS GRADUATE DEBT 
FREE. 
 
WE KNOW THE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF 
TOXIC CORRUPTION AND DEMOCRACY 
DEPENDS ON TRANSPARENCY AND 
ACCOUNTABILITY. 
DEMOCRATS AREN'T JUST RUNNING 
ON GOOD OLD IDEAS LIKE 
REQUIRING PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATES TO RELEASE TAX 
RETURNS AND BARRING LOBBYISTS 
FROM MAKING CAMPAIGN 
CONTRIBUTIONS BUT ON GOOD NEW 
IDEAS. 
LIKE BARRING THEM FROM GETTING 
PAID ON FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. 
WE KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGES 
ADJUST COMING, IT IS HERE. 
SO DEMOCRATS AREN'T JUST 
RUNNING ON GOOD OLD IDEAS LIKE 
INCREASING GAS MILEAGE IN OUR 
CARS. 
WHICH I DID AND WHICH 
REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO 
REVERSE. 
IT ON GOOD NEW IDEAS, LIKE, 
PUTTING A PRICE ON CARBON 
POLLUTION. WE KNOW IN A SMALLER 
MORE CONNECTED WORLD WE CAN'T 
JUST PUT TECHNOLOGY BACK IN A 
BOX. 
WE CAN PUT WALLS UP ALL AROUND 
AMERICA. 
WALLS DON'T KEEP OUT THREATS 
LIKE TERRORISM OR DISEASE. 
 AND THAT'S WHY WE 
PROPOSE LEADING OUR ALLIANCES 
AND HELPING OTHER COUNTRIES 
DEVELOP AND PUSHING BACK 
AGAINST TYRANTS. 
AND DEMOCRATS TALK ABOUT 
REFORMING OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM
. SO YES, IT IS ORDERLY, AND 
FAIR, AND LEGAL BUT IT 
CONTINUES TO WELCOME STRIVERS 
AND DREAMERS FROM ALL AROUND 
THE WORLD. 
THAT'S WHY I AM A DEMOCRAT. 
THAT'S A SET OF IDEAS THAT I 
BELIEVE IN. 
BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, THAT 
EVEN IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ME 
OR DEMOCRATS ON POLICY, EVEN IF 
YOU BELIEVE IN MORE LIBERTARIAN 
ECONOMIC THEORIES, EVEN IF YOU 
ARE AN EVANGELICAL AND YOUR 
POSITION ON CERTAIN SOCIAL 
ISSUES IS A BRIDGE TOO FAR, 
EVEN IF YOU THINK MY ASSESSMENT 
OF IMMIGRATION IS MISTAKEN, AND 
DEMOCRATS AREN'T SERIOUS ENOUGH 
ABOUT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT, 
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT YOU 
SIT STILL BE CONCERNED WITH OUR 
CURRENT COURSE AND SHOULD STILL 
WANT TO SEE A RESTORATION OF 
HONESTY AND DECENCY AND 
LAWFULNESS IN OUR GOVERNMENT. 
 
IT SHOULD NOT BE DEMOCRATIC OR 
REPUBLICAN. 
IT SHOULD NOT BE A PARTISAN 
ISSUE TO SAY THAT WE DO NOT 
PRESSURE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
OR THE FBI TO USE THE CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE SYSTEM AS A CUDGEL TO 
PUNISH OUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS. 
 
OR TO EXPLICITLY CALL IN THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO PROTECT 
MEMBERS OF OUR OWN PARTY FROM 
PROSECUTION BECAUSE AN ELECTION 
HAPPENS TO BE COMING UP. 
I'M NOT MAKING THAT UP. 
THAT'S NOT HYPOTHETICAL. 
IT SHOULDN'T BE DEMOCRATIC OR 
REPUBLICAN TO SAY THAT WE DON'T 
THREATEN THE FREEDOM OF THE 
PRESS BECAUSE THEY SAY THINGS 
OR PUBLISH STORIES WE DON'T 
LIKE. 
 I COMPLAINT PLENTY 
ABOUT FOX NEWS. 
BUT YOU NEVER HEARD ME THREATEN 
TO SHUT THEM DOWN. 
OR CALL THEM ENEMIES OF THE 
PEOPLE. 
IT SHOULDN'T BE DEMOCRATIC OR 
REPUBLICAN TO SAY WE DON'T 
TARGET CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE 
BASED ON WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE OR 
HOW THEY PRAY. 
WE ARE AMERICANS. 
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO STAND UP TO 
BULLIES. 
 NOT FOLLOW THEM. 
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO STAND UP TO 
DISCRIMINATION AND WE SURE ARE 
AS HECK IS SUPPOSED TO STAND UP 
CLEARLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY TO 
NAZI SYMPATHIZERS. 
 HOW HARD CAN THAT 
BE? 
SAYING THAT NAZIS ARE BAD? 
I WILL BE HONEST, SOMETIMES I 
GET INTO ARGUMENTS ABOUT 
PROGRESSIVE FRIENDS ABOUT WHAT 
THE CURRENT POLITICAL MOVEMENT 
REQUIRES. 
THERE ARE WELL-MEANING FOLKS, 
PASSIONATE ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE 
WHO THINKS THINGS HAVE GOTTEN 
SO BAD THE LINES HAVE BEEN SO 
STARKLY DRAWN, THAT WE HAVE TO 
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. WE HAVE 
TO DO THE SAME THINGS TO THE 
REPUBLICANS THAT THEY DO TO US. 
ADOPT THEIR TACTICS. 
SAY WHATEVER WORKS. 
MAKE UP STUFF ABOUT THE OTHER 
SIDE. 
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT. 
IT'S NOT BECAUSE I AM SOFT. 
IS NOT BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED 
IN PROMOTING AN EMPTY 
BIPARTISANSHIP. I DON'T AGREE 
WITH IT BECAUSE ERODING OUR 
CIVIC INSTITUTIONS AND OUR 
CIVIC TRUST AND MAKING PEOPLE 
ANGRY AND YELLING AT EACH OTHER 
AND MAKING PEOPLE CYNICAL ABOUT 
GOVERNMENT, THAT I WAS WORKS 
BETTER FOR THOSE WHO DON'T 
BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF 
COLLECTIVE ACTION. 
YOU DON'T NEED AN EFFECTIVE 
GOVERNMENT OR A ROBUST BREAST --
PRESS WHEN ALL YOU'RE CONCERNED 
ABOUT IS MEANING POWER. 
THE MORE CYNICAL PEOPLE ARE 
ABOUT GOVERNMENT, THE ANGRIER 
AND MORE DISPIRITED THEY ARE 
ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR CHANGE, THE 
MORE LIKELY THE POWERFUL ARE 
ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE POWER. 
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER TO 
MOVE THIS COUNTRY FORWARD, TO 
ACTUALLY SOLVE PROBLEMS AND 
MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER, WE 
NEED A WELL-FUNCTIONING 
GOVERNMENT. 
WE NEED CIVIC INSTITUTIONS TO 
WORK. 
WE NEED COOPERATION AMONG PEOPLE
OF DIFFERENT POLITICAL 
PERSUASIONS. 
AND TO MAKE THAT WORK, WE HAVE 
TO RESTORE OUR FAITH IN 
DEMOCRACY. 
AND TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, 
NOT TEAR THEM APART. 
WE NEED MAJORITIES IN CONGRESS 
AND LEGISLATURES WHO ARE 
SERIOUS ABOUT GOVERNING AND 
WANT TO BRING ABOUT REAL CHANGE 
AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PEOPLE'S 
LIVES. 
AND WE WON'T WIN PEOPLE OVER BY 
CALLING THEM NAMES. 
OR DISMISSING ENTIRE CHUNKS OF 
THE COUNTRY AS RACIST OR SEXIST 
OR HOMOPHOBIC. 
WHEN I SAY BRING PEOPLE 
TOGETHER, I MEAN ALL OF THE 
PEOPLE. NOW, THIS ENTIRE NOTION 
THAT HAS SPRUNG UP ABOUT 
DEMOCRATS NEEDING TO CHOOSE 
BETWEEN TRYING TO APPEAL TO 
WHITE WORKING-CLASS VOTERS OR 
VOTERS OF COLOR AND WOMEN AND 
LGBT AMERICANS, THAT'S 
úNONSENS 
I DON'T BUY THAT. 
I GOT VOTES FROM EVERY 
DEMOGRAPHIC. WE WON BY REACHING 
OUT TO EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC AND 
FIGHTING FOR EVERY VOTE. 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO 
IN THIS ELECTION AND EVERY 
ELECTION AFTER THAT. 
 AND WE CAN'T DO 
THAT IF WE IMMEDIATELY 
DISREGARD WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO 
SAY FROM THE START BECAUSE THEY 
ARE NOT LIKE US. 
BECAUSE THEY ARE WHITE OR THEY 
ARE BLACK OR THEY ARE MAN OR 
WOMAN OR GAIT OR STRAIGHT. 
-- GAY OR STRAIGHT. 
IF WE THINK THERE IS NO WAY 
THEY CAN UNDERSTAND HOW I AM 
FEELING, AND THEREFORE DON'T 
HAVE ANY STANDING TO SPEAK ON 
CERTAIN MATTERS BECAUSE WE ARE 
ONLY DEFINED BY CERTAIN 
CHARACTERISTICS, THAT DOESN'T 
WORK. 
IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY
, THAT DOESN'T WORK. 
WE CAN'T DO THAT IF WE TRAFFIC 
IN ABSOLUTES WHEN IT COMES TO 
POLICY. 
TO MAKE DEMOCRACY WORK, WE HAVE 
TO BE ABLE TO GET INSIDE THE 
REALITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 
DIFFERENT AND HAVE DIFFERENT 
EXPERIENCES AND COME FROM 
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. 
WE HAVE TO ENGAGE THEM EVEN 
WHEN IT IS FRUSTRATING. 
WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEM. 
EVEN WHEN WE DON'T LIKE WHAT 
THEY HAVE TO SAY. 
WE HAVE TO HOPE THAT WE CAN 
CHANGE THEIR MINDS AND WE AFTER 
REMAIN OPEN TO THEM CHANGING 
HOURS. 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN -- OURS. 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO 
CAVED ABOUT POLICY. 
-- CAVE TO ADD POLICY. 
-- BAD POLICY. 
AND WE WILL ISSUE VAGUE 
STATEMENTS OF DISAPPOINTMENT 
WHEN HE DOES SOMETHING 
OUTRAGEOUS BUT NOT ACTUALLY DO 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT. 
THAT'S NOT CIVILITY. 
THAT IS ABDICATING YOUR 
RESPONSIBILITIES. 
BUT AGAIN, I DIGRESS. 
MAKING DEMOCRACY WORK MEANS 
HOLDING ONTO OUR PRINCIPLES AND 
HAVING CLARITY ABOUT PRINCIPLES 
AND THEN HAVING THE CONFIDENCE 
TO GET IN THE ARENA AND HAVE A 
SERIOUS DEBATE. 
AND IT ALSO MEANS APPRECIATING 
THAT PROGRESS DOES NOT HAPPEN 
ALL AT ONCE BUT WHEN YOU PUT 
YOUR SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL, IF 
YOU'RE WILLING TO FIGHT FOR, 
THINGS TO GET BETTER. AND LET 
ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. 
PARTICULARLY THE YOUNG PEOPLE 
HERE, BETTER IS GOOD. 
I USED TO HAVE TO TELL MY YOUNG 
STAFF THIS ALL THE TIME IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
BETTER IS GOOD. 
THAT'S THE HISTORY OF PROGRESS 
IN THE COUNTRY. 
NOT PERFECT. 
BETTER. 
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT DIDN'T END 
RACISM, BUT IT MADE THINGS 
BETTER. 
SOCIAL SECURITY DIDN'T ELIMINATE
ALL POVERTY FOR SENIORS, BUT IT 
MADE THINGS BETTER FOR MILLIONS 
OF PEOPLE. 
DO NOT LET PEOPLE TELL YOU THE 
FIGHT IS NOT WORTH IT BECAUSE 
YU WON'T GET EVERYTHING THAT 
YOU WANT. 
THEY IDEA THAT THERE IS RACISM 
IN AMERICA SO I'M NOT GOING TO 
BOTHER VOTING. 
NO POINT. 
THAT MAKES NO SENSE. 
YOU CAN MAKE IT BETTER. 
BETTER IS ALWAYS WORTH FIGHTING 
FOR. 
THAT'S HOW THE FOUNDERS EXPECTED
THIS SYSTEM OF SELF-GOVERNMENT 
TO WORK. 
THAT THROUGH THE TESTING OF 
IDEAS AND THAT APPLICATION OF 
REASON AND EVIDENCE AND PROOF 
WE COULD SORT THROUGH OUR 
DIFFERENCES AND NOBODY WOULD 
GET EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED 
BUT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO 
FIND A BASIS FOR COMMON GROUND. 
AND THAT COMMON GROUND EXISTS. 
MAYBE IT IS NOT FASHIONABLE TO 
SAY THAT RIGHT NOW. 
IT IS HARD TO SEE IT WITH ALL 
THE NONSENSE IN WASHINGTON. 
IT'S HARD TO HEAR IT WITH ALL 
THE NOISE. 
BUT COMMON GROUND EXISTS. 
I HAVE SEEN IT. 
I HAVE LIVED IT. 
I KNOW THERE ARE WHITE PEOPLE 
WHO CARE DEEPLY ABOUT BLACK 
PEOPLE BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY. 
I HAVE TALKED TO THEM AND LOVED 
THEM. AND I KNOW THERE ARE 
BLACK PEOPLE WHO CARE DEEPLY 
ABOUT THE STRUGGLES OF WHITE 
RURAL AMERICA. 
I'M ONE OF THEM. 
AND I HAVE A TRACK RECORD TO 
PROVE IT. 
I KNOW THERE ARE EVANGELICALS 
WHO ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO 
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE 
CHANGE. 
I HAVE SEEN THEM DO THE WORK. 
I KNOW THERE ARE CONSERVATIVES 
WHO THINK THERE IS NOTHING 
COMPASSIONATE ABOUT SEPARATING 
IMMIGRANT CHILDREN FROM THEIR 
MOTHERS. 
I KNOW THERE REPUBLICANS WHO 
BELIEVE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ONLY 
PERFORM A FEW MINIMAL FUNCTIONS 
BUT THAT ONE OF THOSE FUNCTIONS 
SHOULD BE MAKING SURE THAT 
NEARLY 3000 AMERICANS DON'T DIE 
IN A HURRICANE AND ITS 
AFTERMATH. 
 
COMMON GROUND IS OUT THERE. 
I SEE IT EVERY DAY. 
THAT'S JUST HOW PEOPLE 
INTERACT, HOW PEOPLE TREAT EACH 
OTHER. 
YOU SEE IT ON THE BALLFIELD. 
YOU SEE IT AT WORK. 
IS SUET -- YOU SEE IT IN PLACES 
OF WORSHIP. 
BUT TO SAY IT EXISTS, DOESN'T 
MEAN IT WILL INEVITABLY WIN OUT.
HISTORY SHOWS THE POWER OF FEAR.
AND THE CLOSER THAT WE GET TO 
ELECTION DAY, THE MORE THOSE 
INVESTED IN THE POLITICS OF 
FEAR AND DIVISION WILL WORK, 
WILL DO ANYTHING, TO HANG ON TO 
THEIR RECENT GAINS. 
FORTUNATELY, I'M HOPEFUL BECAUSE
OUT OF THIS POLITICAL DARKNESS 
I AM SEEING A GREAT AWAKENING 
OF CITIZENSHIP ALL ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY. 
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW I 
ENCOURAGED -- HOW ENCOURAGED I 
HAVE BEEN BY SEEING PEOPLE GET 
INVOLVED FOR THE FIRST TIME. 
THEY ARE MARCHING AND ORGANIZING
AND REGISTERING PEOPLE TO VOTE. 
AND THEY ARE RUNNING FOR OFFICE 
THEMSELVES. 
LOOK AT THIS CROP OF DEMOCRATIC 
CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR CONGRESS 
AND GOVERNOR, THE STATE 
LEGISLATURE, RUNNING FOR 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY, SCHOOL BOARD
. IT IS A MOVEMENT OF CITIZENS 
WHO HAPPEN TO BE YOUNGER AND 
MORE DIVERSE AND MORE FEMALE 
THAN EVER BEFORE. 
AND THAT'S REALLY USEFUL. 
 
WE NEED MORE WOMEN IN CHARGE. 
BUT WE HAVE FIRST-TIME 
CANDIDATES, WE HAVE VETERANS OF 
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, RECORD 
NUMBERS OF WOMEN. 
AMERICANS WHO PREVIOUSLY MAYBE 
DIDN'T HAVE AN INTEREST IN 
POLITICS AS A CAREER. 
BUT THEY LACED UP THEIR SHOES 
AND GRABBED A CLIPBOARD BECAUSE 
THEY TOO BELIEVE THIS TIME IS 
DIFFERENT. 
THIS MOMENT IS TOO IMPORTANT TO 
SIT OUT. 
AND IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT THESE 
CANDIDATES ARE TALKING ABOUT IN 
INDIVIDUAL RACES ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY, YOU'LL FIND THEY ARE 
NOT RUNNING AGAINST SOMETHING, 
THEY ARE RUNNING FOR SOMETHING. 
THEY ARE RUNNING TO EXPAND 
OPPORTUNITY AND RUNNING TO 
RESTORE THE HONOR AND COMPASSION
THAT SHOULD BE THE ESSENCE OF 
PUBLIC SERVICE. 
AND SPEAKING AS A DEMOCRAT, 
THAT'S WHEN THEY HAVE ALWAYS 
MADE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN 
THE LIVES OF THE
THE ANTIDOTE TO A GOVERNMENT 
CONTROLLED BY A POWERFUL FEW, A 
GOVERNMENT THAT DIVIDES IS A 
GOVERNMENT BY THE ORGANIZED, 
ENERGIZED INCLUSIVE MANY. 
THAT'S WHAT THIS MOMENT IS 
ABOUT. 
THAT HAS TO BE THE ANSWER. 
YOU CANNOT SIT BACK AND WAIT 
FOR A SAVIOUR. 
YOU CAN'T OPT OUT BECAUSE YOU 
DON'T FEEL SUFFICIENTLY 
INSPIRED BY THIS OR THAT 
PARTICULAR CANDIDATE. 
THIS IS NOT A ROCK CONCERT. 
THIS IS NOT COACHELLA. 
WE DON'T NEED A MESSIAH. 
ALL WE NEED ARE DECENT, HONEST, 
HARD WORKING PEOPLE WHO ARE 
ACCOUNTABLE AND WHO HAVE 
AMERICA'S BEST INTERESTS AT 
HEART. 
AND THEY'LL STEP UP, AND 
THEY'LL JOIN OUR GOVERNMENT, 
AND THEY WILL MAKE THINGS 
BETTER IF THEY HAVE SUPPORT. 
ONE ELECTION WILL NOT FIX 
EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE 
FIXED, BUT IT WILL BE A START. 
AND YOU HAVE TO START IT. 
WHAT'S GOING TO FIX OUR 
DEMOCRACY IS YOU. 
PEOPLE ASK ME, WHAT ARE YOU 
GOING TO DO FOR THE ELECTION. 
NOW, THE -- NO, THE QUESTION IS 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? 
YOU'RE THE ANTIDOTE. 
YOU ARE -- YOUR PARTICIPATION 
AND YOUR SPIRIT AND YOUR 
DETERMINATION, NOT JUST IN THIS 
ELECTION, BUT IN EVERY 
SUBSEQUENT ELECTION, AND IN THE 
DAYS BETWEEN ELECTIONS BECAUSE 
IN THE END THE THREAT TO OUR 
DEMOCRACY DOESN'T JUST COME 
FROM DONALD TRUMP OR THE 
CURRENT BATCH OF REPUBLICANS IN 
CONGRESS OR THE KOCH BROTHERS 
AND THEIR LOBBYISTS OR TOO MUCH 
COMPROMISE FROM DEMOCRATS OR 
RUSSIAN HACKING. 
THE BIGGEST THREAT TO OUR 
DEMOCRACY IS INDIFFERENCE. 
THE BIGGEST THREAT TO OUR 
DEMOCRACY IS CYNICISM. 
CYNICISM HAS LED TOO MANY 
PEOPLE TO TURN AWAY FROM 
POLITICS AND STAY HOME ON 
ELECTION DAY. 
TO ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE 
HERE TODAY, THERE ARE NOW MORE 
ELIGIBLE VOTERS IN YOUR 
GENERATION THAN IN ANY OTHER 
WHICH MEANS YOUR GENERATION NOW 
HAS MORE POWER THAN ANYBODY TO 
CHANGE THINGS. 
IF YOU WANT IT, YOU CAN MAKE 
SURE AMERICA GETS OUT OF ITS 
CURRENT FUNK. 
IF YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT IT, 
YOU HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE SURE 
WE SEIZE A BRIGHTER FUTURE. 
BUT TO EXERCISE THAT CLOUT, TO 
EXERCISE THAT POWER, YOU HAVE 
TO SHOW UP. 
IN THE LAST MIDTERM ELECTIONS 
IN 2014, FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE 
YOUNG PEOPLE VOTED. 
ONE IN FIVE. 
NOT TWO IN FIVE. 
ONE IN FIVE. 
IS IT ANY WONDER THIS CONGRESS 
DOESN'T REFLECT YOUR VALUES AND 
YOUR PRIORITIES? 
ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THAT? 
THIS WHOLE PROJECT OF SELF-
GOVERNMENT ONLY WORKS IF 
EVERYBODY IS DOING THEIR PART. 
DON'T TELL ME YOUR VOTE DOESN'T 
MATTER. 
I HAVE WON STATES IN THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BECAUSE 
OF FIVE, 10, 20 VOTES PER 
PRECINCT. 
AND IF YOU THOUGHT ELECTIONS 
DON'T MATTER, I HOPE THESE LAST 
TWO YEARS HAVE CORRECTED THAT 
IMPRESSION. 
 
>> SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT'S 
GOING ON RIGHT NOW, AND YOU 
SHOULDN'T, DO NOT COMPLAIN. 
DON'T HASHTAG. 
DON'T GET ANXIOUS. 
DON'T RETREAT, DON'T BINGE ON 
WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE BINGING 
ON, DON'T LOSE YOURSELF IN 
IRONIC DETACHMENT, DON'T PUT 
YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND. 
DON'T BOO. 
VOTE. 
 
>> VOTE. 
IF YOU ARE REALLY CONCERNED 
ABOUT HOW THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
SYSTEM TREATS AFRICAN-
AMERICANS, THE BEST WAY TO 
PROTEST IS TO VOTE, NOT JUST 
FOR SENATORS AND 
REPRESENTATIVES BUT FOR MAYORS 
AND SHERIFFS AND STATE 
LEGISLATORS. 
DO WHAT THEY JUST DID IN 
PHILADELPHIA AND BOSTON AND 
ELECT STATE'S ATTORNEYS AND 
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHO ARE 
LOOKING AT ISSUES IN A NEW 
LIGHT, WHO REALIZE THAT THE 
VAST MAJORITY OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT DO THE RIGHT THING 
IN A REALLY HARD JOB, AND WE 
JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL OF 
THEM DO. 
IF YOU'RE TIRED OF POLITICIANS 
WHO OFFER NOTHING BUT THOUGHTS 
AND PRAYERS AFTER A MASS 
SHOOTING, YOU'VE GOTTA DO WHAT 
THE PARKLAND KIDS ARE DOING. 
SOME OF THEM AREN'T EVEN 
ELIGIBLE TO VOTE YET. 
THEY'RE OUT THERE WORKING TO 
CHANGE MINDS AND REGISTERING 
PEOPLE, AND THEY'RE NOT GIVING 
UP UNTIL WE HAVE A CONGRESS 
THAT SEES YOUR LIVES AS MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN A CAMPAIGN CHECK 
FROM THE N.R.A. 
YOU'VE GOTTA VOTE. 
IF YOU SUPPORT THE "ME TOO" 
MOVEMENT, YOU'RE OUTRAGED BY 
STORIES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
AND ASSAULT, INSPIRED BY THE 
WOMEN WHO HAVE SHARED THEM, 
YOU'VE GOTTA DO MORE THAN 
RETWEET HASHTAG, YOU GOTTA 
VOTE. 
PART OF THE REASON WOMEN ARE 
MORE VULNERABLE IN THE WORK 
PLACE IS BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH 
WOMEN ARE BOSSES IN THE WORK 
PLACE. 
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO 
STRENGTHEN AND ENFORCE LAWS 
THAT PROTECT WOMEN IN THE WORK 
PLACE, NOT JUST FROM 
HARASSMENT, BUT FROM 
DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING AND 
PROMOTION AND NOT GETTING PAID 
THE SAME AMOUNT FOR DOING THE 
SAME WORK. 
THAT REQUIRES LAWS, LAWS GET 
PASSED BY LEGISLATORS, YOU'VE 
GOTTA VOTE. 
WHEN YOU VOTE, YOU'VE GOT THE 
POWER TO MAKE IT EASIER TO 
AFFORD COLLEGE AND HARDER TO 
SHOOT UP A SCHOOL. 
WHEN YOU VOTE, YOU'VE GOT THE 
POWER TO MAKE SURE A FAMILY 
KEEPS ITS HEALTH INSURANCE. 
YOU COULD SAVE SOMEBODY'S LIFE. 
WHEN YOU VOTE, YOU'VE GOT THE 
POWER TO MAKE SURE WHITE 
NATIONALISTS DON'T FEEL 
EMBOLDENED TO MARCH WITH THEIR 
HOODS OFF OR THEIR HOODS ON IN 
CHARLOTTESVILLE IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE DAY. 
30 MINUTES. 
30 MINUTES OF YOUR TIME. 
IS DEMOCRACY WORTH THAT? WE 
HAVE BEEN THROUGH MUCH DARKER 
TIMES THAN THESE, AND SOMEHOW 
EACH GENERATION OF AMERICANS 
CARRIED US THROUGH TO THE OTHER 
SIDE, NOT BY SITTING AROUND AND 
WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO 
HAPPEN, NOT BY LEAVING IT TO 
OTHERS TO DO SOMETHING, BUT BY 
LEADING THAT MOVEMENT FOR 
CHANGE THEMSELVES. 
AND IF YOU DO THAT, IF YOU GET 
INVOLVED AND YOU GET ENGAGED 
AND YOU KNOCK ON SOME DOORS AND 
YOU TALK WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND 
YOU ARGUE WITH YOUR FAMILY 
MEMBERS AND YOU CHANGE SOME 
MINDS AND YOU VOTE, SOMETHING 
POWERFUL HAPPENS. 
CHANGE HAPPENS. 
HOPE HAPPENS, NOT PERFECTION, 
NOT EVERY BIT OF CRUELTY AND 
SADNESS AND POVERTY AND DISEASE 
SUDDENLY IS STRICKEN FROM THE 
EARTH. 
THERE WILL STILL BE PROBLEMS. 
BUT WITH EACH NEW CANDIDATE 
THAT SURPRISES YOU WITH A 
VICTORY THAT YOU SUPPORTED AS A 
SPARK OF HOPE HAPPENS. 
WITH EACH NEW LAW THAT HELPS A 
KID READ OR HELPS A HOMELESS 
FAMILY FIND SHELTER OR HELPS A 
VETERAN GET THE SUPPORT HE OR 
SHE HAS EARNED, EACH TIME THAT 
HAPPENS HOPE HAPPENS. 
WITH EACH NEW STEP WE TAKE IN 
THE DIRECTION OF FAIRNESS AND 
JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND 
OPPORTUNITY HOPE SPREADS, AND 
THAT CAN BE THE LEGACY OF YOUR 
GENERATION. 
YOU CAN BE THE GENERATION THAT 
AT A CRITICAL MOMENT STOOD UP 
AND REMINDED US JUST HOW 
PRECIOUS THIS EXPERIMENT IN 
DEMOCRACY REALLY IS, JUST HOW 
POWERFUL IT CAN BE WHEN WE 
FIGHT FOR IT, WHEN WE BELIEVE 
IN IT. 
I BELIEVE IN YOU. 
I BELIEVE YOU WILL HELP LEAD US 
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND I 
WILL BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU 
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. 
THANK YOU, ILLINOIS. 
GOD BLESS YOU. 
GOD BLESS THIS COUNTRY WE LOVE. 
THANK YOU. 
>> HI, EVERYONE, I'M REENA 
NINAN. 
YOU'VE BEEN LITCHING IN TO 
FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA 
SPEAK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
ILLINOIS WHERE HE URGED PEOPLE 
TO GO OUT AND VOTE THIS 
NOVEMBER BECAUSE AS I'M QUOTING 
HERE, HE SAYS OUR DEMOCRACY 
DEPENDS UPON IT. 
HE ALSO TOOK SOME TIME NOT-SO-
VEILED SHOTS REALLY AT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, AT ONE POINT 
SAYING HOW HARD CAN THAT BE, 
SAYING THAT NAZIS ARE BAD. 
THAT'S AN APPARENT REFERENCE TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING THERE 
WERE FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES 
IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. 
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON MR. 
OBAMA'S SPEECH IN JUST A 
MOMENT. 
OUR NANCY CORDES IS ON THE 
GROUND THERE. 
BUT FIRST WE WANT TO BEGIN WITH 
SOME BREAKING NEWS. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CALLING FOR 
A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION AFTER 
THE PUBLICATION OF AN ANONYMOUS 
OP-ED IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES." 
THE PRESIDENT ENGAUGED OVER THE 
PIECE WRITTEN BY AN UNNAMED
