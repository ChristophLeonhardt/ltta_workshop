SECURE AND A BETTER PATH FORWARD. SHANNON. Shannon: RICH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND AS THE SECRETARY OF STATE GROWING DOUBTS OF KIM JONG-UN GIVING UP THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL. FOX NEWS SENIOR ANALYST AND SCOMBRNL GENERAL KEANE. HOW WILL THIS IMPACT THE PRESIDENT. IT IS KEY. AND THE PANEL IS PIVOTAL. AND KIM JONG-UN SENT HIS OWN EMISSARY LARGELY TO DELIVER A MESSAGE TO TRUMP AND IT MAY BE IN WRITING OR VERBAL. HE'S TELLING SECRETARY POMPEO THAT KIM JONG-UNMENTES THE SUMMIT TO GO FORWARD AFTER A WEEK PRIOR OF CONFUSING SIGNALS THAT BROUGHT OUR PRESIDENT TO TERMINATE THE SUMMIT. AND HE'S LIKELY TO COMMIT TO THE DENUCLEARIZATION. AND ALSO IN RETURN. HE WANTS SECURITY FOR HIS RESCOMBREEM AND PERMANENTLY AND DEFINITELY.

AND IN THE MEANTIME AS THEY END, THEY WANT MORE SANCTION RELIEF. AND THEY HAVE EASY WINDS HERE. YOU CAN WIN THE ARMS AND ARMISTICE. AND BRING THE FAMILIES FROM THE NORTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THAT ARE SEPARATED FROM THE WAR AND AGREE IN PRINCIPLE TO HAVE SECURITY. AND THE TOUGH ONE IS GETTING DOWN TO WHAT THEY MEAN BY DENUCLEARIZATION. AND ONE OF THE CRITIQUES OF THE IRAN PLAN, IT IS GOING TO BE A KEY STICKING POINT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A KEY DENUCLEARIZATION. IT IS CLEAR TOMORROW. YOU SAW HE WILL NOT BE MRAPD BY THESE GUYS. IF THE SUMMIT IS ONGOING AND MOVING OUT. IF THIS IS NOT HEADING TO THE
