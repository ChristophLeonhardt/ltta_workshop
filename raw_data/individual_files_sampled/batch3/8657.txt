TO HIM. Bill: BEN HALL IN ISTANBUL. Sandra: LET'S GO TO OUR HEADLINER NEWT GINGRICH FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF THIS SITUATION WITH SAUDI ARABIA? WELL, I THINK HE IS IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION BECAUSE THE IRANIANS, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD LOVE FOR US TO SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM SAUDI ARABIA. BUT THE ISRAELIS AND OTHERS ALL REALIZE THAT THIS IS A VERY, VERY IMPORTANT ALLY OF OURS. I THINK THE STEP ONE IS EXACTLY WHAT SECRETARY POMPEO IS DOING. WE HAVE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. IF IT DOES TURN OUT TO BE SOMEBODY VERY CLOSE TO THE CROWN PRINCE, I THINK THE CROWN PRINCE WILL BE IN VERY SUBSTANTIAL TROUBLE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ARE GOING TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH SAUDI ARABIA BUT IT DOES MEAN WE'LL FIND WAYS TO TAKE STEPS TO COMMUNICATE VERY INTENSELY THAT WE JUST DON'T ACCEPT THIS WHEN THE RUSSIANS POISON PEOPLE IN BRITAIN AND WE WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT IF THE SAUDIS KILLED A JOURNALIST IN TURKEY. STEP ONE TO GET THE FACTS. THEY'RE WORKING AT IT. SECRETARY POMPEO GOT A STRONG PLEDGE. WE'LL SEE IF THE SAUDIS FOLLOW THROUGH. Bill: AND WHAT POMPEO SAYS WHEN HE COMES BACK. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MID-TERMS. THERE IS A PIECE OUT THERE ABOUT REPUBLICANS GETTING PRETTY TAKEN ON THE MONEY SIDE. THERE IS SOME OTHER STORIES THAT COUNTER AND SAY THE RNC IS DOING JUST FINE. WHERE DO YOU SEE AT THE MOMENT US GOING ON NOVEMBER 7th? LET ME JUST WARN THAT ALL OF THE SO-CALLED EXPERTS ON TELEVISION WHO WERE WRONG IN 2016 ARE BACK THIS YEAR AS CONFIDENT AS THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE TOTALLY WRONG IN 2016. NANCY PELOSI YESTERDAY GAVE THE REPUBLICANS THE GREATEST GIFT SHE COULD HAVE GIVEN THEM. HER QUOTES AT HARVARD IN WHICH SHE EXPLAINED YOU DON'T REALLY NEED BORDERS. AFTER ALL, YOU OUGHT TO BE FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE AND WANTING TO HAVE A WALL IS A MACHO THING. THAT IS AS CLEAR A STATEMENT OF THE INSANITY OF THE OPEN BORDERS DEMOCRATIC PARTY AS WE COULD POSSIBLY GET. AND WHEN COMBINED WITH SENATOR FEINSTEIN, BOTH OF THEM OF COURSE FROM SAN FRANCISCO, HAVING INTRODUCED A BILL IN THE SENATE FOR OPEN BORDERS, SUPPORTED BY THE WAY CO-SPONSORED BY EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT IN THE SENATE. I THINK IF THAT'S OUR CHOICE I THINK THAT WE HAVE A I THINK WE HAVE A VERY REAL CHANCE HERE. Bill: I THINK YOU'RE HEARING SOMETHING ELSE IN YOUR EAR. IF THE REPUBLICANS DOUBLE DOWN AND FOCUS ON KEVIN McCARUTHERS EAR'S BILL TO ALLOW US TO CONTROL THE BORDER AND COMPARE THAT WITH THE PELOSI/FEINSTEIN POSITION OF TOTALLY OPEN BORDERS AT A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE A CARAVAN OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING OUT OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND THEN THE AMERICAN CITIZENS CAN DECIDE DO YOU WANT SANCTUARY CITIES? YOU WANT MS-13? YOU WANT FENTANYL AND OPIOIDS AND AN UNENDING FLOOD OF IMMIGRANTS FROM ALL OVER THE PLANET? VOTE DEMOCRAT. AND ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU THINK AMERICA HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTROL ITS BORDER, VOTE REPUBLICAN. Sandra: IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S THE ISSUE THE PRESIDENT IS PUSHING AT THIS MOMENT. CONSIDERING THE LAST TWO TWEETS FROM HIM HAVE BEEN ON THAT TALKING ABOUT THOSE CARAVANS SAYING DEMOCRATS WON'T APPROVE LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR COUNTRY. GREAT MID-TERM ISSUE FOR REPUBLICANS. MOMENTS AGO HE SAYS REPUBLICANS MUST MAKE THE HORRENDOUS WEAK AND OUTDATED IMMIGRATION LAWS AND BORDER A PART OF THE MID-TERMS. THIS LOOKS LIKE THE LATEST PUSH. I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. WHEN YOU SAY TO THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WE HAVE A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR STACY ABRAMS IN GEORGIA WHO BASICALLY WOULD MAKE ALL THE GEORGIA A SANCTUARY STATE. YOU HAVE CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR IN CALIFORNIA, DEMOCRAT WHO SAID HE WANTS TO HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE PAID BY THE GOVERNMENT AND WANTS IT TO APPLY TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. THAT WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA THE MAGNET FOR THE PLANET. IF YOU HAVE A SICKNESS MOVE TO CALIFORNIA AND THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU. THIS IS A CORE CHOICE. IS AMERICA A COUNTRY THAT HAS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT ITSELF AND TO DEFINE WHO COMES IN, OR IS AMERICA NOW GOING TO BE JUST AN OPEN SYSTEM WHERE EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET CAN COME HERE? THAT'S HOW BIG THE CHOICE IS GOING TO BE BY ELECTION DAY. I THINK THE DEMOCRATS WILL LOSE THAT DEBATE BY A HUGE MARGIN. Bill: LET'S GO TO TRISH REGAN'S INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT. THE SOUND BITE FROM THE PRESIDENT AND AN A.P. QUOTE AS WELL. President Trump: I THINK WE'LL DO REALLY WELL. LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE PREDICTIONS. WE HAVE GREAT POLL NUMBERS AND TREMENDOUS TURN-OUTS AT THE RALLIES. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MORE THAN WE CAN HOLD. ENTHUSIASM LIKE WE HAD AT 2016, THE LAST ELECTION. QUITE A SPECTACULAR DAY AND EVENING. I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM. I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE ENTHUSIASM, THE BLUE WAVE. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TREMENDOUS ENTHUSIASM. Bill: HE WILL BE IN MONTANA, NEVADA AND ARIZONA THIS WEEK. IF DEMOCRATS WIN THE HOUSE, IF NANCY PELOSI IS SPEAKER, HOW MUCH HAVE YOU STOPPED TO CONSIDER HOW THIS PRESIDENT WOULD WORK WITH DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE? WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE? HOW DO YOU WORK WITH A PERSON THAT SAYS SHE WANTS TO IMPEACH YOU, WHO DESPISES EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR, AND WHO REPRESENTS A SAN FRANCISCO HARD LEFT WORLDVIEW IN A PARTY WHICH IS BECOMING THE SOCIALIST PARTY OF AMERICA? I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY CONTENTIOUS Bill: GRIDLOCK? ON THE HOUSE SIDE. ON THE SENATE SIDE THE REPUBLICANS WILL GAIN SENATE SEATS. I THINK KEVIN MCCARTHY'S BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO CONTROL OUR BORDERS. I THINK THE ODDS ARE INCREASINGLY GOOD THE REPUBLICANS WILL KEEP THEIR MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND I WENT THROUGH THIS IN 2016. I WAS ON A SHOW TWO WEEKS TO THE DAY BEFORE SOMEBODY SAID TO ME IF YOU LOSE THE SENATE AND YOU LOSE THE PRESIDENCY DID YOU PICK THE WRONG GUY? I SAID WE'RE TWO WEEKS OUT AND YOU ARE ASSUMING? I WOULD SAY RIGHT NOW ON THE ISSUES, REPUBLICANS HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE A HISTORIC ELECTION NIGHT. KEEP THE HOUSE, INCREASE THE SENATE AND HAVE THE DEFENDANT TOTALLY SHOCKED. Sandra: THE PRESIDENT IS ALREADY PREPARING FOR IF THE REPUBLICANS DO LOSE THE HOUSE HE SAYS IT WON'T BE ON ME. HERE HE IS IN AN A.P. INTERVIEW. IT'S A QUOTE. HERE IS WHAT HE SAYS ON THAT. IT'S A TOUGH YEAR, THE MID-TERMS ARE TOUGH FOR EVERYBODY OPPOSITE OF PRESIDENT FOR WHATEVER REASON NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SAY. A.P. ASKS THE QUESTION IF REPUBLICANS WERE TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OR A COUPLE DAYS LATER DEPENDING HOW LONG IT TAKES TO COUNT THE VOTES DO YOU BELIEVE YOU WEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT? HE SAID NO, I THINK I'M HELPING PEOPLE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? FIRST OF ALL THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT AND POINTED OUT THE A.P. HEADLINE WAS TOTALLY WRONG AND MISLEADING. WHAT HE SAID IS EXACTLY RIGHT. I DON'T REMEMBER ANY PRESIDENT WHO HAS CAMPAIGNED HARDER AND HE IS ADDING MORE RALLIES BY THE DAY. I THINK HE WILL HAVE GOTTEN TO 50 RALLIES BY THE TIME OF THE ELECTION. SO HE IS DOING HIS JOB. HE HAS ALSO RAISED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. HE IS DOING HIS JOB. NOW THE CANDIDATES HAVE TO DO THEIR JOBS. IT IS FAIR FOR HIM TO SAY, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THIS IS NOT PURELY A REFERENDUM ON TRUMP BUT THE PREMISE IS WRONG. I WOULD NOT UNTIL I WOULD NOT CONCEDE LOSING THE HOUSE FOR ONE MINUTE. I THINK THAT WE HAVE I THINK WE HAVE THE ISSUES ON OUR SIDE, JOBS VERSUS MOBS, RESULTS VERSUS RESISTANCE, CONSERVATIVE JUDGES VERSUS RADICALS, AND CONTROLLING THE BORDER VERSUS OPEN BORDERS. I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY SURPRISING ELECTION NIGHT. Bill: HE WENT ON TO TWEET ABOUT THAT. BY THE WAY, AT THAT POINT IF WE KEEP THE HOUSE, IF WE KEEP THE HOUSE DOES "THE NEW YORK TIMES" HAVE TO SAY THAT TRUMP WON? Bill: GUESS SO. STAND BY FOR THAT. A.P. HEADLINE WAS DIFFERENT FROM MY QUOTE. THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES. FAKE NEWS. HOW MUCH IS A TRUMP REFERENDUM? HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT REALLY IS ABOUT HIM? I THINK LESS THAN PEOPLE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TWO MONTHS AGO. THE ISSUES ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. THE COUNTRY UNDERSTANDS ON THE KAVANAUGH FIGHT AND THE WAY IN WHICH NOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WAS LIED ABOUT, SMEARED, HAD CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, THE CHILDISH BEHAVIOR OF THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS, THE IMAGERY OF LEFT WING RADICALS SCRATCHING AT THE DOORS OF THE SUPREME COURT. IT HAS GALVANIZED THE COUNTRY AND MADE THE ISSUE BIGGER. WHICH KIND OF AMERICA DO YOU WANT? I WAS JUST? SEATTLE, DALLAS, DES MOINES. PEOPLE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE COUNTRY. THEY JUST WEREN'T WORRIED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. THEY WERE MORE FIRED UP THAN I EVER REMEMBER SEEING THEM. Bill: INTERESTING.
