00:00:00,665 --> 00:00:01,761
- [Hallease] Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01,761 --> 00:00:02,990
I'm Hallease.

3
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,020
I'm a video producer
and digital storyteller

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,853
primarily on YouTube.

5
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:07,900
(funky music)

6
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,193
Welcome to my Patreon.

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,610
I tell digital stories

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,970
about my chaotic good life

9
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,973
and anything else I'm vibing.

10
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:18,870
And I do that through
documentary-style vlogs,

11
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,479
reviews and tutorials.

12
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,810
By joining my production team

13
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,710
here on Patreon,

14
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,910
you'll get early exclusive
and extended access

15
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,990
to my videos,

16
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,410
as well as monthly live streams

17
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,640
where we can chill together

18
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,530
and discuss videos that I've released,

19
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,480
or anything else you want to talk about.

20
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,680
I call y'all producers

21
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,280
because that's what you are.

22
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,940
You're helping me produce the channel

23
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,730
and everything that goes into that,

24
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,970
whether it be gear,

25
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,040
travel expenses,

26
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,080
crew costs,

27
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,820
or living expenses.

28
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,790
Thanks for stopping by

29
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:00,000
and I hope you join the production team.
