i phone Bloggie today is friendsgiving
uh it's gonna be on my house I need to
prepare I'm pairing the venue okay I'm a
monster preparing drink and a side dish
maybe a vegetable who knows but it is 11
o'clock good morning I've been up since
like 8:00 on a Sunday I don't know my
spirit was just up early clean a little
bit sweep I don't want a vacuum but then
I also spray painted some art I'm gonna
hang up on that wall
so I've lost stuff to do you know have
you Sunday though happy friendsgiving
I will give a few tips if you're
interested I got this one from the fam
CK say sneaky Charlotte you're watching
every turn auntie come drink mix recipe
into a syrup first and then add it to
your drink dispenser so that's her tip
which is really helpful my tips are to
make anything classy and water as you
can get these at any my Middle Eastern
Market rose water orange blossom water
and they just add a level of class to an
otherwise questionable drink mix also
seminole because it is friendsgiving so
you need summoning your drinks I have
apples I have oranges I'm a slice these
up like they do on Food Network and put
it in there
Aled SB dare clase
Sergey is my guilty pleasure Hey
semmen em spear and then I'm going to
add that and then add gallons of water
and then the actual
glitter spray things on the cardboard
that the frame came with already has
these frames and I bought an art
magazine like a year ago and I just
filled it with the stuff in the
magazines that I liked that matched the
theme of the season the frame hey now
hey libations yeah curbside little
classy look at friends get in
from my phone so I could make a sad
variation of dirty rice and Malaysia
know how it goes but let me get started
oil onions and basil celery Isis of your
choosing paste ground beef
let it brown now that everything's
browned as your rice in there and you
can hear it snap crackling pot that's
music spraying yeah go look at that look
and a broth of some sort
doesn't have to be chicken or beef it
can be vegetable broth I like to add
part broth part water no idea if that's
enough water but you just put the lid on
lid on and you let it simmer take it off
the high heat put it on low let's simmer
Ferb I don't know all right we'll see
how it looks in the end hey she did that
