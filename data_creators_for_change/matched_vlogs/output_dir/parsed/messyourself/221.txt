just after Mia you know the scene where
we were seeing the concert oh yeah I
think this is like the validity of the
episode because every episode started
off with like what it beats like music
playing and like intro credit alright so
yeah we're playing as Chloe it's a free
course what happened before the storm
that's why it's called before the storm
they're to do but to patrol by the
Smoky's circle right I'm trying to talk
down to the music because I'm pretty
sure it's copyrighted
we're gonna go smoking just choose a
trouble team okay before the storm

do my video in this should I play from
after this wait

layout the old house finally Oh David's
waiting you'll need to bring him his
keys from the ashtray try not to kill

wonder how long it'll take mom to shove
them in a drawer somewhere oh you got
your photos okay so we should bring him
his keys so take the keys okay there we
go
easy peasy lemon ear lemony life is
strange no point in putting off the
inevitable torture of driving to school

trouble with payments again all his
scholarship doesn't cover everything

balls to get on my case I actually have
to let this jackoff drag me to school

I'll trust me again it gets a whole lot
worse later right of the game okay
Annika weapon oh okay

go grab my socket wrench set from the
garage and we can get moving

not gonna know what a socket wrench is
what is this quality time Oh corner if I
would better just get a socket wrench
and get this over with okay this is
episodes like really slow but then again
this isn't like before released again so
I'm probably like missing things you
know what's David doing leaving stuff in
our garage anyway Oh does he think he's
moving in or something yeah groovy dude
I'm supposed to get David he's stupid
wrench what the hell has happened to my
life extinguisher do what he just should
fill this with gasoline just in case
David's car ever catches on fire
oh god that's horrible karma Oh dad's
old camera
to watch me do you think you can make
some for these anymore
Oh remember they Chloe gave that to max
in the last game umberto box dad's
toolbox he used to get so excited
whenever anything sprung a leak or
busted
oh okay here we go open
did I find it did I find it oh yeah
don't worry chance I smash them in the
face with this sixty forty maybe ninety
ten what did I buy what I'm looking for
I get it

a little more hustle wouldn't have
killed you well shut up mister we don't
see what's coming up the works there

kind of awkward okay
Jesus okay you guys they stopped making

ready to roll it's ready to roll you
don't want to talk I want to talk to you
about something
oh no wait bubble oh wait what no come
on
okay guys that was a little bit of a
preview of blind strange before the
storm okay now there's something much
okay but obviously they don't show me
everything in the next episode but yeah
like I said in the beginning the video
you guys need to seriously watch my life
is strange let's play okay it is a
really good let's play all right it's
probably like the least viewed let's
play I've ever done which you know it
shouldn't be you know I think it
deserves more views because this is a
great game and I can't wait for the next
one
so either way so if you guys do want me
to continue this as a let's play when
this game gets released on the 5th of
August then leave a like if we do reach
10,000 or game I will definitely
continue this okay when the episode gets
released
either way though thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video ban sorry guys love you Baba
