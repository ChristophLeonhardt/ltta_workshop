what I'm very pleased to welcome to the program now mark local kuzey UN's humanitarian chief he is live from the United Nations in New York thank you very much for joining us on al-jazeera sir a pretty dire situation with more than 80 percent of Yemenis now lacking food fuel water and access to health care can you tell us first where things stand as far as the humanitarian response plan for Yemen well those people who your viewers have just seen in your report are just some of the nearly 20 million Yemenis who are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance in the UN we've prepared a plan for 2018 to reach many many millions of those people and we need two point five billion dollars during the course of the year to do that I am today announcing the largest ever allocation we have made from the UN central Emergency Response Fund an allocation of fifty million dollars to get the aid operation pump primed for 2018 and the fact that I'm having to do that obviously is not a success measure that is a sign of exactly how desperate the situation is the situation in Yemen today right now to the population of the country looks like the apocalypse and unless unless the situation changes we're gonna have the world's worst humanitarian disaster for 50 years a large allocation of funds you say sir but what good is all that money when UN agencies don't have full humanitarian access to some of the hardest hit communities in Yemen so three things need to happen if we're to avoid this terrible tragedy firstly there does need to be a scaling back of the military activity there's been a big intensification of the bombing and the fighting and the shelling we in the UN of identified 580 airstrikes bombs dropped from the air in the course of December that's twice the number that we identified in November of course all that follows the atrocious missile attacks which all report picked up as well from Yemen into Saudi Arabia so the fighting needs to be scaled back secondly we need to keep the ports open access as you imply as a key issue from November early November to late December the key ports on the Red Sea were basically closed they have been reopened Yemen imports almost all of its food and fuel and medicines those ports need to be kept open and then thirdly we do need more money for the aid operation the UN in the second half of 2017 with its partners was able to reach 7 million people with food and millions more with water and health supplies so we're able to make a big difference say if those three things happen it's not just hunger and famine is it we're now hearing also of outbreaks of more diseases in Yemen like diphtheria in addition to cholera can the aid agencies cope with these additional crises can they bring in the help they need for those kinds of situations well we need to scale up our response the cholera outbreak is probably the worst the world has ever seen with a million suspected cases at the end of 2017 this terrible new epidemic of diphtheria a bacterial disease which should be completely preventable by immunization has already affected up to 500 people with dozens and dozens of deaths in the last few weeks that is going to spread like wildfire unless we can scale up the immunization program and sustain the health services and the things I've talked about the things that need to happen for for that to be possible mr. Leclerc I want to ask you know a more political question Norway announced this week that it would stop supplying weapons to the United Arab Emirates because of what it called grave concern over the humanitarian crisis in Yemen but the US and Britain continue to supply the Saudis with billions of dollars worth of weapons the u.s. also provides logistical military support to Saudi Arabia and there are many people who say they are in a way complicit in this crisis in Yemen why isn't there more pressure on them from the United Nations from the Security Council given this situation that you've described yourself shouldn't they be doing more at the security council level well I think it's a very fair question to ask why the Security Council hasn't engaged on the Yemen crisis in the way it has recently for example on Syria last month on Syria the Security Council came together to agree an extension of a major aid operation to reach millions of people inside Syria and it hasn't been able to do the same thing in Yemen and I think you need to ask that question to the members of the Security Council the Member States Security Council to be taking deciding what to do what action precisely would you as the humanitarian would you enver we would like the Security Council to take well I set out a five-point plan to the Security Council at the beginning of November particularly to deal with the blockade that was put in place at that time so I would like the ports to be kept open I would like the military activity to be scaled back I would like all of the parties to this conflict on all sides to fulfill the responsibilities they have to uphold international humanitarian law to protect civilians and to remember that even wars have laws and everybody the parties the conflict themselves and those outside with an influence on them has a responsibility to do that mark LOCOG thank you so very much for speaking to a smart law caucus the UN humanitarians affairs chief joining us there from New York at the United Nations thank you so much
