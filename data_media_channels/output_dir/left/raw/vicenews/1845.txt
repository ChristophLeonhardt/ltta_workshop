00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,000
we visited<font color="#CCCCCC"> Georgia's energy ministry to</font>

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,890
ask about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a controversial energy deal</font>

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,940
made by Russia earlier this year you

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,469
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know countries wanting</font>

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,360
to diversify their sources of energy but

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it seems to me like right now what's</font>

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening in Georgia is the opposite</font>

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,510
you're relying more and more on Russia

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,970
for your energy needs and selling more

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,980
and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your assets and energy</font>

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,060
explain that it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be discomfort just</font>

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,910
having the Russian<font color="#CCCCCC"> share of this this</font>

extent in the energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> secretary but we're</font>

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,829
looking at this on a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> pragmatic way</font>

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,260
they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the requirements of</font>

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,300
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Georgian legislation well you say</font>

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Georgia requires energy companies</font>

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,329
to follow George and legislation but

20
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,620
you've done nothing about the fact that

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,840
the biggest oil company in Russia

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rosneft has bought a forty-nine percent</font>

illegally in the occupied territory of

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,700
Abkhazia doing exploration work and

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,409
retail work according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to George and</font>

29
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,650

to operate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the occupied territories</font>

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,729
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't you done anything to stop</font>

32
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,890
this actually this was the transaction

which not took<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place within the</font>

jurisdiction of Georgia if it would be

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,939
the case of the Russian company

36
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:25,799
illegally operating in the occupied

through a company in Cyprus but

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,759
effectively it owns forty-nine percent

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this major energy company in Georgia</font>

control of Georgian territory how can

54
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,660
you sweep aside all of that and say that

55
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,370
because the purchase happened in Cyprus

56
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,379
you can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything about it do you</font>

57
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,130
see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks</font>

58
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,590
to the outside world yes actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody</font>

59
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">is happy about this transaction</font>

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,980
definitely because they are potentially

61
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,200
we might be seeing some threads but what

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,350
we can do legally<font color="#E5E5E5"> legally so the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">government made there now I'm a kind of</font>

in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> note satisfaction of this</font>

66
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,400
transaction happening and definitely

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,890
nobody is happy about it the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

68
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,130
knows what the Russian has impact soft

power hard power<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the power they</font>

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,080
might be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can be directed to any</font>

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,780
neighbor and we have experienced<font color="#E5E5E5"> ourself</font>

72
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,090
what this power might bring to Georgia

73
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,650
and to Georgians<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah you've done</font>

74
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,320
nothing about it what are the

75
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,300
instruments well by withdrawing the

76
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,550
license of the company to operate you

77
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,260
might be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make that transaction</font>

78
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,810
worthless ok if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> subject off licence</font>

79
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,390
you could sanction petrol costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

80
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,070
company that Rosneft bought a 49

81
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,700
presents taken enforce them essentially

82
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,870
to sell their stake to a more

83
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,760
appropriate owner I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure whether</font>

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,440
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their kind of fun I just think</font>

85
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,000
Georgia doesn't want to do that's not

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,500
because Georgia can't do it I get the

87
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">impression Georgia doesn't want to do</font>

88
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,640
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay desire is one thing an</font>

89
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual implementation of the desire</font>

90
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,720
within the legal framework this is

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,550
another issue because it's Russian

92
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,760
company should we go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> take just some</font>

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,080
international instruments we have to

94
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,850
demonstrate that their operation is

95
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,950
hindering the interest of Georgia you

96
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,630
don't because the legislation already

97
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,820
says that it's illegal<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them to be</font>

98
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,410
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Georgian market if</font>

101
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,790
behaving badly yeah it's just believe

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,220
occupied territories yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right well</font>

103
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,140
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the signal that it sends you</font>
