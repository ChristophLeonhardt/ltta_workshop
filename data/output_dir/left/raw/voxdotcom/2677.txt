1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,540
Several years back when the Rays made it to
the World Series….they handed out cowbells.

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,940
That's when that's when you kind of second
guess your career.

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,160
There's only so much you can do when 30,000
people are all hitting cowbells.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,080
The sounds inside a stadium can be unpredictable.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,020
But parked outside every major sports event,
in a semi truck full of broadcast tv workers,

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,679
There’s an audio engineer tasked with bringing
those sounds into your living room.

7
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,720
They’re called “A1” mixers.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,329
And they’re hired by the network that’s
broadcasting the game.

9
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:43,879
Basically the easiest way to describe what
it is I do is

10
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:49,199
everything you hear at home in the broadcast
I'm responsible for, other than commercials.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,880
That means they mix the music, the announcers,
sound effects, interviews...

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,200
But it also means this,

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,400
and this,

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,700
and this.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,200
If you just went and looked at a World Series
game from you know, 1980

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,720
and then you looked at like last year's World
Series it would be painfully obvious.

17
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,759
That takes a lot of work.

18
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,780
To capture the ambience of the space, they
point stereo microphones into the crowd.

19
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,391
But we don’t want to just be placed among
the crowd, we want to hear the sounds of the

20
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:39,659
game itself.

21
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,369
And that requires microphones near the action
to capture what they call “field effects.”

22
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:50,700
So I currently run 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.

23
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,360
I run 10 on-court effects mics.

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,350
If you’re sitting in the stands, you might
not hear the sound of the net.

25
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,360
But for viewers at home, there’s a little
microphone taped right under the basket.

26
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,460
In baseball, the key sounds are clustered
around home plate.

27
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,310
You see all the advertising boards.

28
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,140
But there's also two little Blue Jays logos
and in those logos are parabolic dishes and

29
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,600
that's what I use to capture all the sounds
around home plate.

30
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,000
Parabolic microphones use a dish to focus
sound waves from far away.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,830
For big budget games, like the World Series,
you can see those mics around home plate

32
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,200
too, but the setup becomes much more elaborate.

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,670
They put wireless mics in the bases; they
have handheld parabolics out in the foul ball

34
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,560
territory, and they wire up the outfield wall.

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,420
We actually started a couple of years ago,
burying mics in the grass and in the infield

36
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,940
so you can hear like some guys like

37
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,500
Max Scherzer,  they really kind of like grunt
when they release the pitch.

38
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,019
And we also put mikes on the foul poles.

39
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,800
Some of them are like a real thunderous
kind of cannon sound like at Fenway Park.

40
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,080
It’s harder to capture field effects when
the players roam around a big field.

41
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,280
you just hope that they're close to your mics.

42
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,500
You've got a huge field with 15 guys running
... on grass.

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,200
A handheld parabolic mic can do a better job
following the action.

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,740
And that’s long been the standard for NFL
games.

45
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,400
When Fox came along they they put a mike on
the umpire .

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,220
and we were using that to pick up the cadence
of the quarterback and the line coming together.

47
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,440
And that was huge.

48
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,640
The umpire was getting run over a lot, and
to keep him from getting hurt, they moved

49
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,630
his physical position
from being in a defensive line to being on

50
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,620
the offensive line.

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,440
Well that doesn't help me at all.

52
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,120
Because now he's behind the quarterback.

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,210
The next year, the NFL players union agreed
to let the league put microphones on certain

54
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,400
offensive linemen.

55
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,070
Depending on who's mixing it could be way
up in the mix.

56
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,140
I've been called on that because it's like
candy and I love it.

57
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,170
Those quarterback audibles are the only times
they’ll take a mic’d up player live during

58
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,170
a game.

59
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm sure you've seen the games, basketball
games where we mic up players, we mic up the

60
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,180
head coach.

61
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,000
Those mics will never be tracked live.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,680
It goes to tape, somebody reviews it and then

63
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,820
it gets played back later.

64
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,360
But the effects mics can pick up angry
players too.

65
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,440
If something's getting heated on screen I
will you know, I'll kill those mics.

66
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,690
I want people to be able to hear but, you
know I gotta be careful.

67
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,410
The A1 is constantly adjusting the levels
throughout the game, and not just to keep

68
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,540
the show family friendly.

69
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,620
A lot of people would have the thought process
that you just

70
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,900
set up these mics and you leave

71
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,400
them be.

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,020
You don’t.

73
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,940
I mean, you can’t.

74
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,240
I mean you're talking 18-20,000 people screaming, you got the PA sounds.

75
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,940
So if you just leave all these microphones up

76
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,970
you're not going to get anything.

77
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,740
So you're chasing the action with them with
the faders on the mixing board.

78
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,130
The game effects in hockey come from 10
microphones taped inside the glass and the

79
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,740
mixer will fade them up and down to follow the
play.

80
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,940
They can get those effects to pop even more
by tweaking the EQ, or “equalization.”

81
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,800
Most people would know it as like a car stereo.

82
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,491
You turn up your highs, your treble, and your

83
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,000
bass.

84
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,340
Well in our world it's a little bit more specific
than that,

85
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,920
we can dial into actual specific

86
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,440
frequencies.

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,320
So they'll tend to increase the high frequency
EQs and turn down the low frequency.

88
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,100
You don't want that rumble so
you want to hear the skate blades, you want

89
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,580
to hear the sticks, you want to hear the pucks
off glass, you want to hear them off the post.

90
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,300
But all those efforts can be drowned out by
the A1’s arch-nemesis: the PA system in

91
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,300
the arena.

92
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,060
If I could find PA people and beat
them with a wooden stick sometimes I would.

93
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,020
NBA is just it's horrific because
you know they run the PA during play.you

94
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,920
The PA will bleed into all the mics in the
building.

95
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,640
But the audio team is always there, battling
the noise on our behalf.

96
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,160
You should be able to hear the announcers,
follow what they're saying.

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,760
The game should be below that and you should
be able to hear everything that's going on

98
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,210
in the game without struggling.

99
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,220
It takes a lot of work to do that.

100
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,780
If we do it right.

101
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,020
If you're into sports,
