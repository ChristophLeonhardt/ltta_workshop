it's the kind of parade authoritarian leaders have long loved colorful uniforms marching bands and the latest military hardware all on display now US President Donald Trump wants his own reportedly inspired by the French celebrations he attended last year in Paris to mark Bastille Day so preparations for a similar grand display in Washington are underway we're all aware in this country of the president's affection and respect for the military we've been putting together some options we'll send them up to the White House for a decision however such an event is rare in the United States outside of presidential inaugurations the last one was held nearly thirty years ago in Washington to mark the end of the first Gulf War the president watches was in 1961 President John F Kennedy held one for his inauguration in Washington at the height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union he used it to showcase the US Army's first anti-ballistic missiles formal parades may be intermittent but displays a force in the United States have in recent years become more commonplace sporting events and American independence day often reverberate with the sound of a fighter jet flying overhead but parades aren't cheap the last US military parade cost more than eight million dollars back in 1991 that's a lot of money translated into today's dollars I say it's a fantastic waste of money to amuse the president many Americans will view a lack of support for a military parade as unpatriotic charged Trump is used against athletes protesting racism and police brutality who refused to stand during the national anthem more recently he had this to say about lawmakers who refused to clap for him in his recent State of the Union address on American somebody's a treasonous I mean yeah I guess why not the idea of a military parade is yet another example of the political divide that exists in the United States well millions see it as nothing more than a flag waving display of patriotism millions more see it as yet another troubling sign of president Trump's authoritarian tendencies Kimberly Hellcat al Jazeera Washington
