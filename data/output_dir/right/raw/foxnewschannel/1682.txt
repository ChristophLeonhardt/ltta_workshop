00:01:06,077 --> 00:01:07,879
THEY SHOULD APPLY GUN-CONTROL TO

MOVIE GUNS.

38
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:12,049
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO THIS IS

39
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:13,517
TAX MOVIES BY AMOUNTS OF GUNS

40
00:01:13,517 --> 00:01:14,418

DIDN'T HAVE A GUN IN A MOVIE.

60
00:01:51,088 --> 00:01:52,957

19-YEAR-OLD BROUGHT A GUN AND

80
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:26,123
STARTED OPENING FIRE IN A SCHOOL

98
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:50,514
IMPACT.

00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:51,315

DEMONIZED IN MOVIES, NOW IT'S

104
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:01,892
NOT AN ISSUE.

108
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:08,499
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

109
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:10,468
TO SAY GUNS HAVE MADE MONEY FOR

110
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:12,903
HOLLYWOOD, IN THE WAY, IT SEEMS

111
00:03:12,903 --> 00:03:14,672
TO ME, IT ENCOURAGES THEIR

112
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:16,107
CULTURE.

113
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:19,276

116
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,914
BUT I WONDER IF AT SOME POINT IT

117
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:25,783
WOULDN'T BE, WE CAN HAVE A

118
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:26,317
DISCUSSION ABOUT IT.

119
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:30,254
JUST BECAUSE IT'S GUNS DOESN'T

120
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:32,089
MEAN YOU CAN'T DISCUSS IT.

121
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:33,557

122
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:35,593

123
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:35,993
YOU MEAN?

124
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:37,728
>> Juan: THEY REFLECT.

125
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:38,562
THEY SHAPE THE CULTURE.

126
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:39,930
IF YOU ARE A GUY AND YOU SAY I'M

127
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,132
GOING TO HAVE A GUN.

128
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:42,333
I AM A REAL MAN.

129
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,035
BY THE WAY, I SAW HEAR MORE

130

PARENTS SAY AS LONG AS THE

131
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:49,507
VIOLENCE IS JUSTIFIED AND LIKE

132
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:50,608
SELF-DEFENSE WHEN THEY DON'T

133
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,743
MIND SEEING GUNS IN MOVIES.

>> Jedediah: SOMETIMES WHEN

135
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:54,779
PEOPLE WATCH TELEVISION AND

136

137
00:03:56,347 --> 00:03:57,381
ENTERTAINED.

138
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:58,616
I THINK ABOUT THIS EFFORT THAT

139
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:00,051
COULD SANITIZE THESE THINGS,

140
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:00,751
LET'S REMOVE THE VIOLENCE AND

141
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:03,187
LET'S ONLY HAVE IT -- THAT IS

142
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:04,121
NOT WHAT FILM AND TELEVISION

143
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:04,488
SHOULD BE.

144
00:04:04,488 --> 00:04:07,291
SOME OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES.

145
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,292
I LOVE LIAM NEESON.

146
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:11,095
I LOVE HIM IN THE TAKEN MOVIES.

147
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:12,196
SOME OF THESE THINGS RELY ON

148
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:12,663
THAT STORY LINE.

00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:18,569
NO GUN.

153
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:19,904
IT'S INTEGRAL TO THAT.

154
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:21,971
I DON'T THINK, IT'S THE SAME

155
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,275
ARGUMENT PEOPLE MAKE, OH, GREW

156
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,943
UP PLAYING VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES,

157
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:27,678
YOU'RE GOING TO BE VIOLENT.

158
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:28,913
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.
