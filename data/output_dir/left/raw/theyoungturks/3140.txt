1
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,529
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN --

2
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:44,330
>>DAMN STRAIGHT. DOWN GOES
FLYNN, DOWN GOES FLYNN. THEY GOT

3
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,330
HIM ON A LITTLE CHARGE, THERE IS
A LOT MORE THEY COULD HAVE

4
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,890
GOTTEN HIM ON BUT THAT'S THE
WHOLE POINT OF A PLEA DEAL, I

5
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,239
GIVE YOU A LITTLE CHARGE, YOU
GIVE ME A LOT OF INFORMATION. OF

6
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:59,739
COURSE THE BIG QUESTION IS, WHAT
IS A LOT OF INFORMATION? AND

7
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:04,009
FLYNN COULD HAVE THE MOTHER
LODE. JOHN, MORE DETAILS.

8
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:09,160
>>WE WILL BREAK INTO LATER ON
OUR SPECULATION OF WHO ELSE

9
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,110
COULD BE DRAGGED INTO THIS BASED
ON WHAT WE THINK FLYNN MIGHT

10
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,750
KNOW, BUT FIRST LET'S BREAK DOWN
WHAT FLYNN ADMITTED TO DOING --

11
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:34,320
>>OF COURSE, IMPORTANTLY, THIS
IS BEFORE DONALD TRUMP WAS

12
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,149
PRESIDENT, THIS IS DURING THE
TRANSITION PERIOD --

13
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:50,340
>>SO THEY TALKED TO THEMSELVES,
WHAT SHOULD WE SAY THE RUSSIANS

14
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,250
ABOUT SANCTIONS, THE NEXT DAY
PUTIN MAKES A BIG CHANGE, HE

15
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,880
DOESN'T RETALIATE, BUT SO FAR
IT'S JUST FLYNN AND MAYBE HE

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,940
TALKED TO SOMEONE, I DON'T THINK
ANYONE ELSE WAS INVOLVED. BUT

17
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,090
THEN YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS TWEET
--

18
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:09,410
>>IT CAME OUT THE DAY AFTER
FLYNN'S CONVERSATION ON THE

19
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,270
PHONE. IT SEEMS LIKE HE WAS
PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE,

20
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,840
I HAVE A FEELING THEY PROBABLY
LOOPED HIM IN BUT I LEAVE THAT

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,830
TO ROBERT MUELLER. WE HAVE SOME
OTHER ISSUES TO DISCUSS BUT NONE

22
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,680
OF THE REASONS THIS IS IMPORTANT
IS ALTHOUGH NOBODY CARES ABOUT

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,480
THIS LAW, THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOR
IS TECHNICALLY A FEDERAL CRIME,

24
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,989
IT GOES AGAINST THE LOGAN ACT --

25
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:47,270
>>THAT IS OBVIOUSLY WHAT THAT
IS INTENDED TO DO, TALKING TO

26
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,560
RUSSIA ABOUT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION'S CHANGES TO THE

27
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,890
POLICY AND THEN TRYING TO CHANGE
RUSSIA'S RETALIATION AGAINST

28
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,599
THAT POLICY. NOW, NO ONE HAS
EVER ACTUALLY GONE TO JAIL FOR

29
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,450
BREAKING THE LOGAN ACT, IT'S A
VERY OLD LAW, IT IS STILL

30
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,010
TECHNICALLY A FELONY, I JUST
THINK IT'S AMAZING THAT SOME

31
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,860
LAWS, EH, IT'S OLD, WHO CARES,
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

32
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,370
>>LET'S LAY OUT FURTHER DETAILS
ABOUT WHAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN

33
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,579
CONVICTED ON, AND WHAT HE HAS
PLED GUILTY ON. HE PLED GUILTY

34
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,469
ON LYING TO THE FBI. BUT SINCE
JOHN IS RIGHT THAT MOST PEOPLE

35
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:27,040
DON'T PURSUE THE LOGAN ACT, IF
HE HAD JUST TOLD THE FBI, YES, I

36
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,599
TALKED TO THE RUSSIAN
AMBASSADOR, AND YES TECHNICALLY

37
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,069
WE ARE NOT IN OFFICE YET, WE
WILL BE IN OFFICE IN ABOUT A

38
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:37,489
MONTH, BUT I WANTED TO START
NEGOTIATIONS ON BOTH THE

39
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,390
SANCTIONS FRONT BUT ALSO THE
ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS -- FAIRLY

40
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,030
INCONCEIVABLE THAT THAT WOULD
HAVE CREATED ANY KIND OF

41
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,810
CONTROVERSY, THAT THE FBI WOULD
HAVE BEEN LIKE, OH NO, THAT'S A

42
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,959
BIG DEAL. NETANYAHU CALLED TRUMP
AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY

43
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,290
DIDN'T SUFFER ANY INTERNATIONAL
CONSEQUENCES FOR CONTINUING TO

44
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,970
OCCUPY THE PALESTINIANS, THAT IS
AMERICAN POLICY 101. NO WAY

45
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,510
ANYONE WOULD GET INTO TROUBLE
FOR THAT. BUT HE LIED TO THE FBI

46
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,470
ANYWAY, WHICH IS WHAT TRIGGERED
NOT ONLY THE CHARGES, BUT THEN

47
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,639
THE QUESTION OF, WHY? WHY ARE
YOU BOTHERING TO COVER THIS UP?

48
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,410
AND IT TURNS OUT HE COVERED A
LOT OF STUFF UP, AND THERE IS

49
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,870
GOOD REASON FOR THAT.

50
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,858
>>BEFORE WE JUMP INTO MORE
ANALYSIS I WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE

51
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:25,920
OR TWO VIDEOS, IT HAS BEEN A
ROUGH YEAR -- THIS WILL

52
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,860
HOPEFULLY MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

53
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,919
HERE IS FLYNN LEAVING THE
COURTHOUSE AFTER WHAT

54
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:33,070
HAPPENED THIS MORNING.

55
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:41,280
>>LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! LOCK
HIM UP!

56
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:49,160
>>JUST IN CASE YOU ARE COMING
INTO THE STORY A LITTLE BIT

57
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,890
LATER AND YOU THINK THAT IS JUST
AN UNRULY MOB, IT'S ACTUALLY A

58
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,000
REFERENCE TO SOMETHING INVOLVING
FLYNN, HERE IS SPEAKING AT THE

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,460
RNC THIS LAST GO AROUND.

60
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:08,000
>>WE DO NOT NEED A RECKLESS
PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES SHE IS

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:19,720
ABOVE 

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
THE LAW.

63
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,030
>>[CHANTING] LOCK HER UP, LOCK
HER UP!

64
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,470
>>LOCK HER UP, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT, LOCK HER UP.

65
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,890
>>I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT,
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. YOU GUYS ARE

66
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:40,070
GOOD. DAMN RIGHT, EXACTLY RIGHT.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

67
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,220
YOU KNOW WHY WE ARE SAYING THAT?
WE ARE SAYING THAT BECAUSE IF I

68
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,570
-- I GUY WHO KNOWS THIS BUSINESS
-- IF I DID A TENTH OF WHAT SHE

69
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,670
DID I WOULD BE IN JAIL TODAY.

70
00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:00,570
>>CAN DO, DID DO. SO HE'S NOT
YET IN JAIL, AND BY THE WAY,

71
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,650
EVEN ON THIS RELATIVELY LATE
CHARGE, GIVEN WHAT HE COULD'VE

72
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,750
GOTTEN -- AND AGAIN THAT'S THE
PART OF A PLEA DEAL -- HE COULD

73
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,370
STILL GET UP TO FIVE YEARS IN
PRISON. SO, LOCK HIM UP INDEED.

74
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,910
AND HE DIDN'T DO A TENTH OF WHAT
HILLARY CLINTON DID, HE DID FAR

75
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,910
WORSE.

76
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,580
>>AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE
WOULD TAKE A PLEA DEAL BECAUSE

77
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,580
BASED ON THE CHARGES HE WAS
PREVIOUSLY FACING HE WAS LOOKING

78
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,730
TO SERVE UP TO 60 YEARS IN
PRISON. BUT WHO KNOWS WHETHER OR

79
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,330
NOT HE WOULD GET THE FULL
SENTENCE, THAT IS A SERIOUS

80
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,190
SENTENCE I THINK HE WANTED TO
AVOID. AND ONE THING I WANT TO

81
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,221
QUICKLY ADD, I THINK WHAT YOU
SEE THROUGH THE ENTIRE RUSSIA

82
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:40,820
INVESTIGATION WEATHER IT
INVOLVES FLYNN OR OTHER

83
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,150
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PART OF THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, OR TRUMP

84
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,970
HIMSELF, IS THIS UNWILLINGNESS
TO BE FORTHCOMING, AND WHY? IF

85
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,280
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL THE

86
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,290
TRUTH THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE
PROCESS? THEY JUST KEEP LYING

87
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,540
AND HIDING THINGS.

88
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,370
>>THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE
REASONS FOR FLYNN'S COVERUPS AND

89
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,080
LIES. ONE IS PERSONAL, THE OTHER
ONE IS ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN AND

90
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,220
ADMINISTRATION. HE HAS HIS OWN
MESS WHEN IT COMES TO NOT JUST

91
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,770
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT BUT THE
TURKISH GOVERNMENT -- NOT ONLY

92
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,610
DID HE TAKE ABOUT $500,000 FROM
THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND

93
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,820
DIDN'T REVEAL IT, WHICH IS
ANOTHER VIOLATION OF THE LAW, IT

94
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,830
WAS DONE THROUGH A SHELL COMPANY
THAT WAS DUTCH, HE PRETENDED IT

95
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,560
WAS DUTCH BUT HE KNEW IT WAS THE
TURKISH GOVERNMENT GIVING HIM

96
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,990
THE MONEY, THAT IS A MORE
SERIOUS VIOLATION -- BUT WORSE

97
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,080
YET, HE WAS IN A MEETING WITH
TURKISH OFFICIALS WHERE THEY

98
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,670
TALKED ABOUT KIDNAPPING SOMEONE
INSIDE THE UNITED STATES FOR $15

99
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:46,270
MILLION. NOW, THEY GETS WORSE --
HIS SON WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN

100
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,460
THAT. SO NOT ONLY DID HE FACE UP
TO 60 YEARS FOR ALL THE

101
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,800
DIFFERENT CHARGES, BUT HIS SON
FACED SOME SERIOUS JAIL TIME AS

102
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,520
WELL, AND THAT KNUCKLEHEAD, MIKE
FLYNN, JR., IS ONE OF THE

103
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,540
DUMBEST GUYS IN AMERICA, SO NOT
SURPRISING THAT THAT CLOWN GOT

104
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,110
HIS DAD, ALSO A CLOWN, INTO
TROUBLE, AND TRUMP AS WELL. IF

105
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,800
THEY HAD JUST GOTTEN CONVICTED
ON THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND

106
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,360
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT STUFF HE
DIDN'T ADMIT TO, FOR EXAMPLE HE

107
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,780
GOT MONEY FROM RT TO VISIT
PUTIN, $45,000, AND GOT MONEY

108
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,650
FROM RUSSIAN BUSINESS INTERESTS
ON THAT SAME TRIP FOR ABOUT

109
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,720
22,000 -- YOU THINK HE COULD DO
THAT, JILL STEIN WAS AT THE SAME

110
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,790
DINNER, I DON'T KNOW SHE GOT
PAID, BUT IT'S NOT THAT BIG A

111
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,690
DEAL, JUST REVEAL IT. BUT AGAIN
HE LIED ABOUT IT, HE PRETENDED

112
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,240
IT WAS U.S. COMPANIES THAT PAID
HIM ON THE TRIP. WHY? THAT LEADS

113
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,669
TO, IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE
GOING ON WITH FLYNN AND TRUMP IN

114
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,820
REGARD TO RUSSIA? I THINK THAT
IS THE MOTHER LODE, THAT IS THE

115
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,480
INTERESTING PART HERE. AND
ROBERT MUELLER, WHO IS AN

116
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,930
EXCELLENT PROSECUTOR, BUT GIVE
HIM A PLEA DEAL WHEN HE WAS

117
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,050
FACING ALL THE SERIOUS CHARGES
BECAUSE HE GAVE HIM MEDIOCRE

118
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,069
INFORMATION. FLYNN OBVIOUSLY
GAVE HIM REALLY GOOD INFORMATION

119
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:04,660
ABOUT PEOPLE HIGHER UP ON THE
CHAIN, PARTICULARLY ONE THAT I

120
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,420
HIGHER UP ON THE CHAIN NAMED
TRUMP.

121
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,550
>>IT'S INTERESTING YOU BRING UP
THE SON, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

122
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,620
SPECULATING FOR WHAT FEELS LIKE
MONTHS NOW THAT THAT MIGHT BE

123
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,170
WHAT GETS HIM TO FINALLY FLIP
AND ASSIST THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S

124
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,480
INVESTIGATION. HERE IS FLYNN'S
STATEMENT THAT CANNOT TODAY

125
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,420
WHICH MAYBE GETS INTO THAT A
LITTLE BIT --

126
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:32,709
>>I DON'T KNOW IF GOD WAS IN
FAVOR OF THE $15 MILLION FOR THE

127
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:43,149
KIDNAPPING, I DON'T KNOW WHERE
GOD STANDS ON 

128
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,149
THAT --

129
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:48,590
>>FULL RESPONSE ABILITY FOR THE
ONES I'M NOW GOING TO BE CHARGED

130
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,540
WITH, NOT WITH THE OTHERS,
BECAUSE I'M DOING THE DEAL.

131
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,620
>>AND FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF
MY FAMILY. NOW, YOU WANT TO HEAR

132
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:01,380
SOME THING AMAZING? A KIND OF A
HERO IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY, OF

133
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:08,499
THIS STORY, IS A NEOCON. WHAT?
IT'S A GUY I TOTALLY, UTTERLY

134
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:12,100
DISAGREE WITH, HE HELPED TO
START THE IRAQ WAR, I COULDN'T

135
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,069
DISAGREE WITH HIM MORE, BUT
JAMES WOOLSEY, FORMER CIA

136
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:18,490
DIRECTOR, WAS IN THE MEETING
WERE THE TURKISH OFFICIALS WERE

137
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,949
LIKE, YOU WANT 15 MILLION FOR
THE KIDNAPPING AND WOOLSEY IS

138
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:28,910
LIKE, I WILL SEE YOU LATER. AND
HE TOLD THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE

139
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,220
FLYNN BOYS WERE INTERESTED IN
THAT DEAL, THAT IS PART OF WHAT

140
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,449
GOT THEM IN SO MUCH TROUBLE.

141
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:36,939
>>THERE ARE A COUPLE OTHER
ASPECTS WE WILL DISCUSS BUT I

142
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:39,540
WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON ONE THING,
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THESE

143
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,069
CONVERSATIONS THAT HE LIED ABOUT
TO THE FBI, THAT IS WHY HE HAS

144
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:47,290
FLIPPED NOW. BUT THIS REALLY
TAKES THE ENTIRE THING FULL

145
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,930
CIRCLE, STARTING WITH THE COMEY
INCIDENTS, HIS FIRING, WHY

146
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,001
MUELLER WAS BROUGHT ON, ALL OF
THAT ORIGINALLY STARTED WITH

147
00:10:55,001 --> 00:11:00,490
FLYNN. SO I WANT TO GO THROUGH A
COUPLE STEPS THAT I THINK REALLY

148
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,290
MAKE THAT CLEAR. UNDERSTAND THAT
THE WHITE HOUSE IS SAYING THAT

149
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,450
NOTHING ABOUT THE GUILTY PLEA OR
THE CHARGE AND LOCATE ANYONE

150
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,149
OTHER THAN MR. FLYNN -- WHICH
THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SAY FOR NOW,

151
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:13,269
I GUESS. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT
SOME TIMES --

152
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:37,510
>>UNDERSTAND, IMPORTANTLY, THEY
DIDN'T CARE ORIGINALLY ABOUT

153
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,380
THAT. THEY THOUGHT, SO WHAT, WE
CAN ALL BE FLIPPED. BUT ANYWAY,

154
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,380
GOING ON --

155
00:11:42,380 --> 00:12:05,720
>>THIS CONVERSATION WITH COMEY
CAUSED HIM TO ORIGINALLY FEEL

156
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,259
THAT COMEY WOULD NO LONGER BE
LOYAL TO HIM --

157
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:16,309
>>IT IS BELIEVED THAT FLYNN WAS
ALSO INVOLVED IN THE PUTIN CALL.

158
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:20,899
SO IN THE SPAN OF ONE WEEK YOU
HAVE FLYNN AND PAPADOPOULOS

159
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:25,019
LYING ABOUT CONTACTS WITH THE
RUSSIANS, YOU HAVE TOTALLY

160
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,439
UNCONNECTED -- BECAUSE TRUMP
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ANY OF THIS --

161
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:31,990
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY LIE TO
THE FBI, TRUMP HAS A DINNER WITH

162
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,250
THE FBI DIRECTOR WHERE HE SAYS
HE NEEDS HIM TO PLEDGE HIS

163
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,749
LOYALTY, AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER
THAT TALKS TO VLADIMIR PUTIN ON

164
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:42,999
THE PHONE. THAT IS A WEIRD WEEK
EARLY ON, IT'S THE FIRST WEEK OF

165
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:43,999
THE PRESIDENCY.

166
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:47,540
>>TOO MANY COVERUPS IF THIS WAS
JUST ABOUT, OH, AND THE

167
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,120
TRANSITION WE TALKED TO THE
AMBASSADOR FOR RUSSIA. THERE ARE

168
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,430
TOO MANY COVERUPS FOR THAT,
AGAIN, MUELLER WOULDN'T OFFER A

169
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,410
PLEA DEAL FOR SOMETHING THAT
SMALL ANYWAY. BUT THAT COMEY

170
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,610
CONVERSATION IS SO IMPORTANT,
AND FLYNN FLIPPING IS SO

171
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,290
IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IF IT TURNS
OUT THAT TRUMP ASKED COMEY TO

172
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:14,470
TAKE IT EASY ON FLYNN BECAUSE
HE'S A GOOD GUY, HE'S MY FRIEND,

173
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,860
WE GREW UP TOGETHER AND ATE
BAGELS FOR LUNCH -- WHATEVER,

174
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,880
SOME ABSURD REASON HAVING
NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP'S

175
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,670
COVER-UP -- WELL, THEN IT'S
HARDER TO MAKE AN OBSTRUCTION OF

176
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,869
JUSTICE CASE. BUT IF FLYNN TELLS
THE AUTHORITIES, NO, TRUMP WAS

177
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:33,300
TRYING TO GET ME OFF BECAUSE WE
WERE COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS

178
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,529
TOGETHER -- OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE. AND TRUMP IS SCREWED.

179
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:42,759
>>I DON'T KNOW HOW LIKELY IT IS
THAT IT WILL PLAY OUT THAT WAY

180
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:46,050
BUT I THINK YOU MAKE A GOOD
POINT ABOUT BOB MUELLER BEING A

181
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,920
GOOD PROSECUTOR, AND HE WON'T
GIVE HIM A PLEA DEAL THAT

182
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,509
SIGNIFICANT FOR A LACK OF
INCRIMINATING INFORMATION. AND

183
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:58,589
REMEMBER, TRUMP JUST FLAT OUT
IGNORED THE WARNINGS FROM YATES,

184
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,600
WHICH JOHN MENTIONED, AND TRUMP
ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS

185
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,089
TRIED TO GET INDIVIDUALS
INVESTIGATING THIS CASE TO JUST

186
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:09,600
DROP IT, WHETHER IT WERE MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS THAT WERE DOING AN

187
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,279
INVESTIGATION, OR FIRING COMEY,
THERE IS ALSO ITS A WEIRD SHADY

188
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,939
STUFF GOING ON AND YOU PILE THAT
ONTO THE FACT THAT THEY AREN'T

189
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:21,429
BEING FORTHCOMING WITH CONTACTS
WITH RUSSIAN OFFICIALS.

190
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:24,860
>>AS YOU WERE JUST IMPLYING,
EARLIER THIS SUMMER, THIS WAS

191
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,360
BROKEN I BELIEVE YESTERDAY BY
THE NEW YORK TIMES, TRUMP CALLED

192
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,930
SENIOR REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS
TO GET THEM TO STOP THE

193
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,980
INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING
SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO RICHARD

194
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,779
BURR, LEADER OF THE SENATE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE PROBE.

195
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,060
BURR AND OTHERS JUST SAY HE
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS

196
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,240
INAPPROPRIATE OR NOT, BUT THIS
CONTINUES A MONTHS LONG CAMPAIGN

197
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,709
OF TRYING TO STOP THESE
INVESTIGATIONS. WHICH IF ALL IT

198
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,660
WAS WAS THAT THEY MISREMEMBERED
SOME BENIGN PHONE CALLS SEEMS

199
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,769
LIKE A BIZARRE LEVEL OF INTEREST
THAT HE IS TAKING. EVEN PULLING

200
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,709
COMEY ASIDE AND TALKING TO HIM
JUST BECAUSE HE THOUGHT FLYNN

201
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,550
HAD MISSPOKEN ABOUT SOME
CONVERSATIONS -- DOES ANYONE

202
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,040
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT
WAS DRIVING TRUMP NOT JUST TO

203
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,350
FIRE THE HEAD OF THE FBI TO
PROTECT HIS FRIEND, BUT THEN,

204
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,249
AND I REALIZE SO MUCH HAS
HAPPENED, IT'S EASY TO FORGET

205
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:15,339
THIS STUFF, IMMEDIATELY AFTER, A
FEW WEEKS OR A MONTH AFTER HE

206
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,610
HAD BEEN FIRED, HE WAS TALKING
WITH HIS AIDES ABOUT REHIRING

207
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,929
HIM, APPARENTLY HE MADE A PHONE
CALL TO FLYNN EVEN THOUGH BANNON

208
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:26,220
TOLD HIM NOT TO, TELLING HIM TO
STAY STRONG, AND IN MARCH OF

209
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,809
THIS YEAR THERE WAS THE LEAK
FROM FLYNN'S TEAM SAYING HE WAS

210
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:35,060
LOOKING INTO POTENTIALLY DOING
SOME SORT OF DEAL WITH THE

211
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,540
INVESTIGATION. AND AT THAT POINT
THEY SAID HE HAD A STORY TO

212
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,679
TELL, WITH THE IDEA BEING THAT
IF YOU ARE DOING THIS SO EARLY,

213
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,920
WHEN BARELY ANY OF THE
INVESTIGATORY WORK HAD BEEN

214
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,779
DONE, YOU ARE WORRIED THAT NOT
JUST YOU WILL GO DOWN BUT THAT

215
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,240
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE A STORY AS
WELL, AND YOU ARE THE FIRST

216
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,309
TO GET TO THE INVESTIGATORS YOU
MIGHT GO DOWN, WHICH IS WHY HE

217
00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:00,569
MADE THE SEEMINGLY INSANE MOVE
OF MAKING IT PUBLIC THAT HE

218
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:02,670
WANTED A DEAL BAT

219
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:08,870
>>THERE ARE TWO LAYERS FOR
TRUMP, ONE IS THE COLLUSION WITH

220
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,601
THE RUSSIANS, IF FLYNN KNOWS
ABOUT THAT, THE SECOND IS THE

221
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:16,129
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE WHERE HE
TRIES TO STOP THIS

222
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:18,620
INVESTIGATION. ANA AND JOHN WERE
JUST REFERRING TO THAT. AND

223
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,720
THERE'S A QUOTE FROM DONALD
TRUMP ON TWITTER, WHERE HE SAID

224
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,399
MIKE FLYNN SHOULD ASK FOR
IMMUNITY, AND IT IS A WITCH

225
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,629
HUNT, EXCUSE FOR BIG ELECTION
LOSS BY MEDIA AND DEMS OF

226
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:33,449
HISTORIC PROPORTION. THERE YOU
ARE COMMITTING OBSTRUCTION OF

227
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:38,420
JUSTICE IN PLAIN SIGHT, SAYING
TO A GUY UNDER INVESTIGATION,

228
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:45,629
ASK FOR IMMUNITY. AND WHEN YOU
COULD SOMEDAY GIVE A PARDON TO

229
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,569
THAT GUY, IT'S BASICALLY SAYING
I TRIED TO GET THE FBI DIRECTOR

230
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:52,579
TO DROP THE INVESTIGATION, HE
WOULDN'T DO IT, NOW YOU ARE

231
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,860
UNDER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, NOW
I'M TELLING YOU PROBABLY TO ASK

232
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,670
FOR IMMUNITY BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT YOU TO GET IN TROUBLE, AND

233
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:06,140
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK. AND NOW THAT
FLYNN HAS FLIPPED AND IS WILLING

234
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,640
TO GIVE INFORMATION ON WHATEVER
THEY DID INTERNALLY, THE FACT

235
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,990
THAT TRUMP WAS TRYING TO COVER
THAT UP SEEMS APPARENT AND

236
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,609
OBVIOUS. SO EVEN IF THE
COLLUSION CHARGE, WE DON'T KNOW

237
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:20,519
MUCH YET BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT FLYNN HAS TOLD MUELLER, THE

238
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,741
OBSTRUCTION CHARGES RIGHT IN
FRONT OF US, HE DID IT

239
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:27,189
PUBLIC LEAD BY THE ONLY QUESTION
WAS, WOULD FLYNN FLIP?

240
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:30,210
NOW HE HAS, AND THEY WILL
ALMOST CERTAINLY GET HIM ON

241
00:17:30,210 --> 00:00:00,000
OBSTRUCTION.
