INVESTIGATE, PROSECUTE AND HOLD 
ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO ILLEGALLY 
ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE IN OUR 
POLITICAL AND ELECTORAL 
PROCESS. 
TO ADDRESS THESE MATTERS 
FURTHER, I WANT TO WELCOME 
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE DAN COATS, F.B.I. 
DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY, 
SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, DIRECTOR OF 
THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY 
GENERAL PAUL MACASONI, AND 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER 
AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON TO MAKE 
SOME COMMENTS AND TAKE 
QUESTIONS ON THIS TOPIC. 
AS YOU ALL KNOW, WE'VE 
ADDRESSED WHAT OCCURRED DURING 
THE 2016 ELECTION NUMEROUS 
TIMES AND RATHER EXTENSIVELY. 
THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S BRIEFING 
IS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW 
AND IN THE FUTURE TO PROTECT 
THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS 
MOVING FORWARD. 
AND WE ASK THAT YOU STAY ON 
THAT TOPIC. 
IN ORDER TO HELP THIS RUN 
SMOOTHLY, WE ALSO ASK THAT YOU 
WOULD DIRECT YOUR QUESTIONS TO 
A SPECIFIC PERSON. 
WITH THAT, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON TO OPEN UP 
AND MAKE SOME COMMENTS. 
>> WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
SARAH. 
WHAT WE'D LIKE TO ADDRESS TODAY 
IS ELECTION SECURITY IN THE 
2018 ELECTION AND IN THE 
FUTURE. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE IT VERY 
CLEAR I THINK WHAT HIS PRIORITY 
IS. 
WE'VE HAD OBVIOUSLY A NUMBER OF 
INQUIRIES FROM CONGRESS ON 
THIS, INCLUDING A LETTER TO ME 
THE PAST COUPLE DAYS FROM FIVE 
SENATORS SIGNED BY SENATOR 
SCHUMER AND FOUR OTHERS. 
I HAVE RESPONDED TO THAT LETTER 
TODAY. 
WE'VE MADE COPIES AVAILABLE TO 
YOU, AND IT'S FORMS KIND OF A 
FRAMEWORK FOR THE BRIEFING THAT 
THE FOUR HEADS OF OPERATING 
DEPARTMENT AND AGENCIES ARE 
GOING TO GIVE YOU HERE TODAY. 
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE 
IMPLEMENTING AND 
OPERATIONALLIZING THE POLICY 
THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED. 
THERE ARE OTHER AGENCIES 
INVOLVED, BUT THESE ARE THE 
FOUR PRIMARY ONES. 
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT 
WE ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN 
THIS, HIS LEADERSHIP, HIS 
DETERMINATION TO PREVENT 
RUSSIAN AND OTHER FOREIGN 
INFLUENCE IN ELECTIONS. 
WE MEET ON THIS CONSTANTLY, THE 
SENIOR STAFF HERE AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
WE MEET WITH THE HEADS OF THE 
DIFFERENT AGENCIES INVOLVED, WE 
DISCUSS IT QUITE REGULARLY IN 
MY TENURE AS NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISER LESS THAN TWO MONTHS 
WE'VE ALREADY HAD TWO FULL 
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL 
MEETINGS CHAIRED BY THE 
PRESIDENT, AND AS I SAID, 
COUNTLESS OTHER DISCUSSIONS AS 
WELL. 
SINCE JANUARY 2017 THE 
PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN DECISIVE 
ACTION TO DEFEND OUR ELECTIONS 
SYSTEMS FROM MEDDLING AND 
INTERFERENCE. 
THIS INCLUDES MEASURES TO 
HEIGHTEN THE SECURITY AND 
RESILIENCE OF ELECTION SYSTEMS 
AND PROCESSES, TO CONFRONT 
RUSSIAN AND OTHER FOREIGN 
MALIGNED INFLUENCE IN THE 
UNITED STATES, TO CONFRONT SUCH 
AGGRESSION THROUGH 
INTERNATIONAL ACTION AND TO RE-
ENFORCE A STRONG SANCTIONS 
REGIME. 
AS YOU KNOW, ELECTIONS ARE 
ADMINISTERED BY STATE AND LOCAL 
GOVERNMENTS, SO THE FEDERAL 
ROLE IS TO ASSIST THEM. 
WE'LL BE ADDRESSING THAT 
THROUGH THE COMMENTS FROM THE 
HEADS OF THE OPERATING 
AGENCIES. 
I MIGHT ALSO SAY BY WAY OF 
INTRODUCTION THAT MANY FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO PROTECT 
ELECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES 
SUCH AS THOSE IMPLEMENTED BY 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY OR 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE 
NECESSARILY SENSITIVE AND 
HIGHLY CLASSIFIED. 
WE DO NOT WISH TO MAKE THE 
EFFORTS OF OUR ADVERSARIES ANY 
EASIER THROUGH INJUDICIOUS 
PUBLIC DISCLOSURES. 
NONETHELESS, WE HAVE OFFERED TO 
DO BEFORE AND CONTINUE TO OFFER 
BRIEFINGS TO MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS IN SECURE FACILITIES. 
SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO HERE, AS 
SARAH SAID, IS TURN THE 
BRIEFING OVER TO THE PEOPLE 
WHOSE AGENCIES HAVE THIS 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
WE'LL START OFF WITH DIRECTOR 
OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DAN 
COATS. 
HE'LL BE FOLLOWED BY THE 
SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN. 
SHE'LL BE FOLLOWED BY THE 
DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU 
OF INVESTIGATION CHRISTOPHER 
WRAY, AND THEN FINALLY THE 
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY AGENCY GENERAL PAUL 
NAKASONI. 
SO, DAN. 
>> WELL, AS DIRECTOR OF 
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, I WOULD 
LIKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO 
KNOW THAT THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY AND ALL OF ITS 
AGENCIES ARE POSTURED TO 
IDENTIFY THREATS OF ALL KINDS 
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS SPECIFICALLY 
DIRECTED US TO MAKE THE MATTER 
OF THE ELECTION MEDDLING AND 
SECURING OUR ELECTION PROCESS A 
TOP PRIORITY, AND WE HAVE DONE 
THAT AND ARE DOING THAT AND 
WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. 
WE HAVE INCORPORATED THE 
LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE 2016 
ELECTION AND IMPLEMENTED A 
BROAD SPECTRUM OF ACTIONS TO 
SHARE MORE INFORMATION ACROSS 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL 
AS WITH STATE AND LOCAL 
GOVERNMENTS AND ALSO WITH THE 
PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
CONTINUES TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE THREATS OF UPCOMING U.S. 
ELECTIONS, BOTH MIDTERMS AND 
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS OF 
2020. 
IN REGARDS TO RUSSIAN 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS, WE CONTINUE TO SEE A 
PERVASIVE MESSAGING CAMPAIGN BY 
RUSSIA TO TRY TO WEAKEN AND 
DIVIDE THE UNITED STATES. 
THESE EFFORTS ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE 
TO THIS ELECTION OR FUTURE 
ELECTIONS BUT CERTAINLY COVER 
ISSUES RELEVANT TO THE 
ELECTION. 
WE ALSO KNOW THE RUSSIANS TRY 
TO HACK INTO AND STEAL 
INFORMATION FROM CANDIDATES AND 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ALIKE. 
WE ARE AWARE THAT RUSSIA IS NOT 
THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS AN 
INTEREST IN TRYING TO INFLUENCE 
OUR DOMESTIC POLITICAL 
ENVIRONMENT. 
WE KNOW THERE ARE OTHERS WHO 
HAVE THE CAPABILITY AND MAY BE 
CONSIDERING INFLUENCE 
ACTIVITIES. 
AS SUCH, WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR AND WARN OF ANY SUCH 
EFFORTS. 
I AM COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE 
THAT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
IS WORKING TOGETHER IN 
INTEGRATING ACROSS 
ORGANIZATIONS ADMISSIONS AND 
SEEKING GREATER TRANSPARENCY 
WITH THE PUBLC. 
THE O.D.N.I. 
HAS INSTITUTED A BROAD SPECTRUM 
OF ACTIONS COVERING COLLECTION, 
ANALYSIS, REPORTING, EDUCATION 
AND PARTNERSHIPS, ALL DESIGNED 
TO PROVIDE THE BEST THREAT 
ASSESSMENTS TO FEDERAL, STATE 
AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AS WELL AS 
TO THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
SECTOR WHEN NECESSARY. 
FOR EXAMPLE, MY OFFICE LEADS 
THE INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP 
NOW MEETING WEEKLY AS A PUSH 
TOWARDS NOVEMBER WITH 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, F.B.I., 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY, C.I.A. 
AND N.S.A. 
INCLUSIVE OF REGIONAL CYBER AND 
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE EXPERTS ALL 
FOCUSED ON ENSURING ELECTION 
SECURITY AND INTEGRATION OF OUR 
EFFORTS. 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY'S 
FOCUS RIGHT NOW IS PERSISTENT 
SUPPORT TO THE F.B.I., TO THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
AND OTHER AGENCIES IN THEIR 
ELECTION RESPONSIBILITIES AND 
MY OFFICE IS ENSURING THESE 
ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVE TIMELY 
AND PROACTIVE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY SUPPORT. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 
THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US. 
I WANT TO START BY BRIEFLY 
MENTIONING THAT ON TUESDAY 
D.H.S. 
HOSTED THE FIRST NATIONAL CYBER 
SECURITY SUMMIT. 
THIS BROUGHT TOGETHER 
GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY LEADERS 
AND ACADEMIA TO DISCUSS 
OPPORTUNITIES TO JOIN FORCES TO 
COUNTER THREATS TO OUR NATION'S 
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. 
I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THOSE 
WHO JOINED US FROM ACADEMIA, 
GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR, ALL WHO PARTICIPATED 
AND THOSE WHO SIGNED UP TO 
CONCRETE ACTIONS TO CONFRONT 
CYBER SECURITY CHALLENGES. 
ACROSS EVERY CRITICAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR FROM 
ENERGY TO FINANCIAL SERVICES TO 
TRANSPORTATION TO COMMUNICATION 
AND SO MANY OTHERS, A SINGLE 
ATTACK CAN HAVE WIDESPREAD AND 
CASCADING CONSEQUENCES. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH 
THE NATION'S LEADING MINDS IN 
THE DIGITAL REALM AS WE STAND 
UP THE NATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
CENTER. 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST RISK TO OUR 
PROSPERITY, PRIVACY AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE TO WORRY 
ABOUT, AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE 
HERE TODAY. 
OUR DEMOCRACY ITSELF IS IN THE 
CROSSHAIRS. 
FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS ARE THE 
CORNERSTONE OF OUR DEMOCRACY 
AND IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT 
THEY ARE THE TARGET OF OUR 
ADVERSARIES WHO SEEK AS THE 
D.N.I. 
JUST SAID TO SO DISCORD AND 
UNDERMINE OUR WAY OF LIFE. 
I FULLY SHARE THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY AND THE O.D.N.I.'S 
ASSESSMENTS, PAST EFFORTS AND 
THOSE TODAY TO INTERFERE WITH 
OUR ELECTION AND OF THE CURRENT 
THREAT. 
OUR ADVERSARIES HAVE SHOWN THEY 
HAVE THE WILLINGNESS AND 
CAPABILITY TO INTERFERE IN OUR 
ELECTIONS. 
D.H.S. 
HAS AND CONTINUES TO WORK 
CLOSELY WITH STATE AND LOCAL 
ELECTION OFFICIALS THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY BY OFFERING A RANGE 
OF SERVICES TO HELP IDENTIFY 
WEAKNESSES IN THEIR ELECTION 
SYSTEMS, WHETHER IT'S OFFERING 
NO-COST, VOLUNTEER TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE OR SHARING BEST 
PRACTICES FOR SECURING ONLINE 
VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASES, 
OR PROVIDING TECHNICAL ADVICE 
ON RANSOMWARE AND DESTRUCTIVE 
MALWARE, OUR DEPARTMENT STANDS 
READY TO PROVIDE TAILORED 
SUPPORT BASED ON EACH 
JURISDICTION'S UNIQUE NEEDS. 
THIS IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE 
WHERE ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT 
ALL. 
I AM PLEASED TO INFORM YOU THAT 
TO DATE ALL 50 STATES, THE 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND OVER 
900 LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE 
PARTNERED WITH D.H.S. 
IN ORDER TO BOLSTER THE 
RESILIENCE OF THE NATION'S 
ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE. 
VARIOUS STATES ALSO HAVE 
ORGANIC CAPABILITIES AND ARE 
ENGAGING WITH THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR AND ACADEMIA TO IMPROVE 
THE SECURITY OF ELECTIONS. 
ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT 
A DESTINATION. 
IT REQUIRES AGGRESSIVE AND 
ONGOING VIGILANCE. 
EVERYONE MUST PLAY THEIR ROLE 
TO ENSURE THAT EVERY VOTE IS 
COUNTED AND IS COUNTED 
CORRECTLY. 
ALL OF US UP HERE TODAY, 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, STATE AND 
LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS AND 
THE PUBLIC. 
AS ALL OF US UP HERE TODAY GAIN 
NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE POTENTIAL 
ADVERSARIES AND CAMPAIGN, WE 
ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING OUR 
PARTNERS WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S 
BEST INTELLIGENCE AND 
INFORMATION AVAILABLE. 
THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IS 
REAL AND THE NATION'S ELECTIONS 
ARE MORE RESILIENT TODAY 
BECAUSE OF THE WORK WE ARE ALL 
DOING. 
BUT WE MUST CONTINUE TO ENSURE 
THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS 
PROTECTED. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND 
I'LL TURN IT OVER TO DIRECTOR 
WRAY. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY. 
LAST FALL AFTER I -- SHORTLY 
AFTER I BECAME DIRECTOR, I 
STOOD UP A NEW FOREIGN 
INFLUENCE TASK FORCE AT THE 
F.B.I. 
WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY 
AND COUNTERACT THE FULL RANGE 
OF MALIGNED FOREIGN INFLUENCE 
OPERATIONS TARGETING OUR 
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND OUR 
VALUES. 
THE TASK FORCE NOW BRINGS 
TOGETHER ACROSS THE WATERFRONT 
OF F.B.I. 
EXPERTISE, WE'RE TALKING 
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE, CYBER, 
CRIMINAL AND EVEN 
COUNTERTERRORISM DESIGNED TO 
ROOT OUT AND RESPOND TO FOREIGN 
INFLUENCE OPERATIONS. 
FOR THEIR PART, OUR ADVERSARIES 
INFLUENCE OPERATIONS HAVE 
ENCOMPASSED A WIDE RANGE OF 
ACTIVITIES. 
SO JUST LIKE WE HAVE A MULTI-
DISCIPLINARY RESPONSE, THAT'S 
BECAUSE THE THREAT IS MULTI-
DISCIPLINARY. 
SO JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF SOME 
OF THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN OVER 
THE PAST, TARGETING U.S. 
OFFICIALS AND OTHER U.S. 
PERSONS THROUGH TRADITIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE TRADE CRAFT, 
CRIMINAL EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS 
VOTING AND PROVIDE ILLEGAL 
CAMPAIGN FINANCING, CYBER 
ATTACKS AGAINST VOTING 
INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG WITH 
COMPUTER INTRUSIONS TARGETING 
ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OTHERS, 
AND A WHOLE SLEW OF OTHER KINDS 
OF INFLUENCE LIKE BOTH OVERTLY 
AND COVERTLY MANIPULATING NEWS 
STORIES, SPREADING 
DISINFORMATION, LEVERAGING 
ECONOMIC RESOURCES AND 
ESCALATING DIVISIVE ISSUES. 
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT JUST AN 
ELECTION CYCLE THREAT. 
OUR ADVERSARIES ARE TRYING  TO 
UNDERMINE OUR COUNTRY ON A 
PERSISTENT AND REGULAR BASIS, 
WHETHER IT'S ELECTION SEASON OR 
NOT. 
THERE'S A CLEAR DISTINCTION 
BETWEEN ON THE ONE HAND 
ACTIVITIES THAT THREATEN THE 
SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF OUR 
ELECTIONS SYSTEMS AND ON THE 
OTHER HAND THE BROADER THREAT 
OF INFLUENCE OPERATIONS 
DESIGNED TO MANIPULATE AND 
INFLUENCE OUR VOTERS AND THEIR 
OPINIONS. 
WITH OUR PARTNERS WE'RE TRYING 
TO COUNTERACT BOTH THREATS. 
WE HAVE THREE PILLARS TO OUR 
OPERATIONAL STRATEGY. 
THE FIRST PILLAR IS OUR 
INVESTIGATIONS AND OUR 
OPERATIONS. 
AND FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS 
WHICH I HOPE ARE OBVIOUS AND 
INCLUDING OPERATIONAL 
SENSITIVITIES, I'M NOT GOING TO 
BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE THE FULL 
EXTENT OF THOSE EFFORTS, BUT I 
WILL TELL YOU THAT OUR FOREIGN 
INFLUENCE TASK FORCE WORKS WITH 
F.B.I. 
PERSONNEL IN ALL 56 F.B.I. 
FIELD OFFICES. 
AND EVEN AS WE SPEAK, WE'VE GOT 
OPEN INVESTIGATIONS WITH A 
FOREIGN INFLUENCE NEXUS 
SPANNING FIELD OFFICES, F.B.I. 
FIELD OFFICES ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY. 
SO MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE SCOPE 
OF THIS FOREIGN INFLUENCE 
THREAT IS BOTH BROAD AND DEEP. 
SECOND PILLAR, I SAID THERE 
WERE THREE PILLARS. 
THE SECOND IS FOCUSED ON 
INFORMATION SHARING AND 
INTELLIGENCE SHARING. 
WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR 
PARTNERS IN THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY AND IN THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT, AS WELL AS WITH OUR 
STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS TO 
ESTABLISH A COMMON OPERATING 
PICTURE. 
JUST LAST WEEK AS AN EXAMPLE WE 
DISSEMINATED A LIST TO OUR 
STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
PARTNERS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN 
INFLUENCE INDICATORS FOR THEM 
TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR, 
THINGS LIKE MALICIOUS CYBER 
ACTIVITY, SOCIAL ABNORMALITIES 
AND FOREIGN PROPAGANDA 
ACTIVITIES. 
THE IDEA IS TO MARSHAL 
ADDITIONAL EYES AND EARS IN THE 
FIGHT. 
WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH OUR 
INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS TO 
EXCHANGE INTELLIGECE AND 
STRATEGIES FOR COMBATING THE 
THREAT BECAUSE THIS IS AFTER 
ALL A SHARED THREAT WITH OUR 
ALLIES. 
THE THIRD PILLAR OF OUR 
APPROACH IS BASED ON OUR STRONG 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR. 
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE A 
FRONT LINE RESPONSIBILITY TO 
SECURE THEIR OWN NETWORKS, 
PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS, BUT 
WE'RE DOING OUR PART BY 
PROVIDING ACTIONABLE 
INTELLIGENCE TO BETTER ENABLE 
THEM TO ADDRESS ABUSE OF THEIR 
PLATFORMS BY FOREIGN ACTORS. 
SO THIS YEAR WE'VE MET WITH TOP 
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES AND 
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SEVERAL 
TIMES. 
WE'VE GIVEN THEM CLASSIFIED 
BRIEFINGS, WE'VE SHARED 
SPECIFIC THREAT INDICATORS AND 
ACCOUNT INFORMATION, AND A 
VARIETY OF OTHER PIECES OF 
INFORMATION SO THEY CAN BETTER 
MONITOR THEIR OWN PLATFORMS. 
THE REALITY IS IT'S GOING TO 
TAKE ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER 
TO HOLD THE FIELD BECAUSE THIS 
THREAT IS NOT GOING AWAY. 
AS I HAVE SAID CONSISTENTLY, 
RUSSIA ATTEMPTED TO INTERFERE 
WITH THE LAST ELECTION AND 
CONTINUES TO ENGAGE IN MALIGNED 
INFLUENCE OPERATIONS TO THIS 
DAY. 
THIS IS A THREAT WE NEED TO 
TAKE EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY AND TO 
TACKLE AND RESPOND TO WITH 
FIERCE DETERMINATION AND A 
FOCUS. 
AND TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNERS, 
BOTH THOSE HERE AND SOME OF THE 
OTHER PARTNERS WE'VE TALKED 
ABOUT, I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE 
CAN PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF 
OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND 
MAINTAIN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE 
DURING OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> GOOD AFTERNOON, LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN. 
THANKS FOR JOINING US THIS 
AFTERNOON. 
I APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP AND 
SUPPORT FROM THE PRESIDENT, THE 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, THE 
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE. 
I BELIEVE OUR MANDATE IS CLEAR. 
AS PART OF ITS MISSION TO 
DEFEND THE NATION, THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS 
PROVIDING INTELLIGENCE, 
INFORMATION, SUPPORT AND 
TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
FOR USE BY STATE AND LOCAL 
OFFICIALS TO PREVENT FOREIGN 
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS. 
THIS IS A VITAL MISSION FOR US 
AND THE NATION. 
IT DRAWS ON OUR DEEP EXPERIENCE 
AND EXPERTISE IN CONTINUING 
WORK IN THIS AREA. 
OUR SUPPORT HAS BEEN ONGOING 
AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE 
MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 
WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING 
INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION 
LEADS TO THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF 
INVESTIGATION ON FOREIGN 
ADVERSARIES WHO ARE ATTEMPTING 
TO SOW DISCORD AND DIVISION 
WITHIN THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. 
THIS INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH 
APPROPRIATE ENTITIES TO ALERT 
THEM OF MALICIOUS CYBER ACTORS. 
U.S. CYBER COMMAND AND THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY ARE 
TRACKING A WIDE RANGE OF 
FOREIGN CYBER ADVERSARIES AND 
ARE PREPARED TO CONDUCT 
OPERATIONS AGAINST THOSE ACTORS 
ATTEMPTING TO UNDERMINE OUR 
NATION'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 
THESE TYPE OF OPERATIONS ARE 
SENSITIVE AND REQUIRE 
CONFIDENTIALITY FOR SUCCESS. 
I WON'T DISCUSS THE SPECIFICS 
EXCEPT TO STATE THAT OUR FORCES 
ARE WELL TRAINED, READY AND 
VERY CAPABLE:  I HAVE COMPLETE 
CONFIDENCE IN THE FORCES UNDER 
MY COMMAND. 
WE WILL WORK IN CONJUNCTION 
WITH OTHER ELEMENTS OF OUR 
GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE WE BRING 
THE FULL POWER OF OUR NATION TO 
BEAR ON ANY FOREIGN POWER THAT 
ATTEMPTS TO INTERFERE IN OUR 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES. 
I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE 
MODERATOR. 
>> THANK YOU. 
AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING, IT 
WE COULD STAY ON TOPIC AND ALSO 
IF YOU COULD WHEN ASKING A 
QUESTION DIRECT IT TO A 
SPECIFIC PERSON, AND AS ALWAYS, 
AFTER WE FINISH THIS PART OF 
THE BRIEFING, I'LL BE BACK TO 
ANSWER OTHER QUESTIONS ON NEWS 
OF THE DAY. 
JOHN, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  DIRECTOR COATS, IF 
I COULD DIRECT A QUESTION TO 
YOU. 
>> SURE. 
>>REPORTER:  LET ME TAKE YOU 
BACK, IF I COULD, TO HELSINKI, 
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO 
INDICATE THAT HE MAY BELIEVE 
VLADIMIR PUTIN WHEN HE SAYS HE 
DIDN'T HAVE ANY INFLUENCE IN 
THE 2016 ELECTION. 
WHAT IS YOUR BELIEF ABOUT THE 
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT 
IN MEDDLING IN 2016. 
AND IF AS YOU SAY RUSSIA 
CONTINUES TO TRY TO INFLUENCE 
OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS, DOES 
THAT MEAN THAT NOTHING MUCH 
CAME OF THE MEETING WITH PUTIN, 
OR IS IT OTHER GOVERNMENT 
ACTORS WHO ARE INVOLVED? 
>> WELL, IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE 
2016 ELECTION, OF COURSE NONE 
OF US WERE IN OFFICE AT THAT 
PARTICULAR TIME, BUT BOTH THE 
PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT, 
I THINK EVERYONE ON THIS STAGE 
HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT THAT 
THE I.C.A. 
WAS A CORRECT ASSESSMENT OF 
WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016. 
WE HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY MADE THE 
DETERMINATION TO MAKE THIS A 
TOP PRIORITY, THAT IT DOESN'T 
HAPPEN AGAIN, AND WE'RE 
THROWING EVERYTHING AT IT. 
AND WE WILL HAVE AND WILL BE 
DISCUSSING THAT HERE TODAY. 
RELATIVE TO MY DISCUSSIONS WITH 
THE PRESIDENT ON WHATEVER ISSUE 
IT IS, THOSE -- I DO NOT GO 
PUBLIC WITH THAT. 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE PROPER 
THING TO DO. 
SO OUR FOCUS HERE TODAY IS TO 
SIMPLY TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE THREAT, IT 
IS REAL, IT IS CONTINUING, AND 
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN 
TO HAVE A LEGITIMATE ELECTION 
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN 
HAVE TRUST IN. 
IN ADDITION TO THAT, IT GOES 
BEYOND THE ELECTIONS, IT GOES 
TO RUSSIA'S INTENT TO UNDERMINE 
OUR DEMOCRATIC VALUES, DRIVE A 
WEDGE BETWEEN OUR ALLIES AND DO 
A NUMBER OF OTHER NEFARIOUS 
THINGS, AND WE ARE LOOKING AT 
THAT ALSO. 
BUT TODAY WE ARE HERE TO TALK 
ABOUT THE ELECTIONS COMING UP 
AND WHAT WE'RE DOING, ASSURING 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
>>REPORTER:  LET ME CLARIFY. 
BOTH YOU AND DIRECTOR WRAY SAID 
THAT RUSSIA CONTINUES TO TRY TO 
MEDDLE IN OUR ELECTIONS. 
>> THEY DO. 
>>REPORTER:  AND INFLUENCE 
VOTERS. 
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ROGUE 
RUSSIAN INDIVIDUALS? 
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE 
KREMLIN? 
>> I'M THINKING YOU CAN -- BOTH 
AND EVEN ADD TO THAT. 
RUSSIA HAS USED NUMEROUS WAYS 
IN WHICH THEY WANT TO INFLUENCE 
THROUGH MEDIA, SOCIAL MEDIA, 
THROUGH BOTS, THROUGH ACTORS 
THAT THEY HIRE, THROUGH 
PROXIES, ALL OF THE ABOVE AND 
POTENTIAL MORE. 
-- AND POTENTIALLY MORE. 
I CAN'T GO INTO DEEP, DEEP 
DETAILS BECAUSE IT IS 
CLASSIFIED. 
IT IS PERVASIVE, IT IS ONGOING 
WITH THE INTENT TO ACHIEVE 
THEIR INTENT AND THAT IS DRIVE 
A WEDGE AND UNDERMINE OUR 
DEMOCRATIC VALUES. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU. 
A QUESTION FOR DIRECTOR WRAY. 
THANK YOU. 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT 
MUELLER HAS INDICTED MORE THAN 
20 RUSSIAN OFFICIALS BASED ON 
WORK BY THE F.B.I. 
FOR MEDDLING IN THE 2016 
ELECTIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED THAT 
THAT INVESTIGATION BY THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL IS A HOAX AND 
THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE SHUT 
DOWN. 
I KNOW YOU SAID YOU DON'T 
BELIEVE IT IS A HOAX. 
BUT WHY WOULD THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE 
SAYING ABOUT THE F.B.I. 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT 
THE INVESTIGATION BY THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL IS A HOAX AND 
WHEN THE PRESS SECRETARY 
YESTERDAY SAID THAT THERE WAS A 
LOT OF CORRUPTION WITHIN THE 
F.B.I., DO YOU HAVE ANY 
RESPONSE TO THOSE THINGS COMING 
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE? 
>> WELL, I CAN ASSURE THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE MEN 
AND WOMEN OF THE F.B.I. 
STARTING FROM THE DIRECTOR ALL 
THE WAY ON DOWN ARE GOING TO 
FOLLOW OUR OATHS AND DO OUR 
JOBS. 
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, SARAH. 
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR DIRECTOR 
COATS. 
DIRECTOR COATS, HOW WOULD YOU 
CHARACTERIZE THE CURRENT 
RUSSIAN EFFORTS TO MEDDLE IN 
THE 2018 ELECTION RELATIVE TO 
2016? 
IS IT MORE INTENSE? 
DO YOU SEE THOSE EFFORTS 
FOCUSED ON A PARTICULAR PARTY, 
AND IN GENERAL, IS THE PACE OF 
RELATIVE TO 2014, 2012, OR IS 
IT MORE ATTEMPTS? 
>> RELATIVE TO WHAT WE HAVE 
SEEN FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, 
IT IS NOT THE KIND OF ROBUST 
CAMPAIGN THAT WE ASSESSED IN 
2016 ELECTION. 
WE KNOW THAT THROUGH DECADES 
RUSSIA HAS TRIED TO USE ITS 
PROPAGANDA AND METHODS TO SOW 
DISCORD IN AMERICA. 
HOWEVER, THEY STEPPED UP THEIR 
GAME BIG TIME IN 2016. 
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT KIND OF 
ROBUST EFFORT FROM THEM SO FAR. 
AS I MENTIONED PUBLICLY JUST A 
FEW WEEKS AGO, WE ARE ONLY ONE 
KEYBOARD CLICK AWAY FROM 
FINDING OUT SOMETHING THAT WE 
DON'T -- HAVEN'T SEEN UP TO 
THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. 
BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NOT SEEN 
THAT. 
>>REPORTER:  TO FOLLOW UP, SIR, 
DO YOU SEE IT DIRECTED TO ANY 
PARTICULAR PARTY? 
THIS CURRENT 2018 EFFORT, IS 
THERE ANY PARTY CURRENTLY 
BENEFITING FROM ANY 2018 
RUSSIAN EFFORT? 
>> WHAT WE SEE IS THE RUSSIANS 
ARE LOOKING FOR ANY OPPORTUNITY 
REGARDLESS OF PARTY, REGARDLESS 
OF WHETHER OR NOT IS APPLIES TO 
THE ELECTION TO CONTINUE THEIR 
PERVASIVE EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE 
OUR FUNDAMENTAL VALUES. 
>>REPORTER:  ALSO FOR DIRECTOR 
COATS. 
PERHAPS AMBASSADOR BOLTON CAN 
WEIGH IN ON THIS AS WELL. 
ON THE RUNOFF IT -- RUNUP TO 
THE HELSINKI SUMMIT, THE NATO 
AMBASSADORS TO RUSSIA SAID THAT 
THE PRESIDENT WOULD RAISE THE 
MGNED PRESIDENT WITH PUTIN. 
YOU'RE SAYING TODAY THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS DIRECTED YOU TO 
MAKE THE ISSUE OF ELECTION 
MEDDLING A PRIORITY. 
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE 
DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT YOU ARE 
SAYING, HIS ADVISERS AND WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID ABOUT 
THIS ISSUE? 
>> I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO 
EITHER UNDERSTAND FULLY OR TALK 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN 
HELSINKI. 
I'LL THROW IT OVER TO THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY DIRECTOR 
HERE. 
>> THE ISSUE WAS DISCUSSED, 
AND, IN FACT, PRESIDENT PUTIN 
SAID I THOUGHT AT THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE BUT CERTAINLY IN THE 
EXPANDED BILATERAL MEETING WHEN 
THE TWO LEADERS GOT TOGETHER 
WITH THEIR SENIOR ADVISERS 
PRESIDENT PUTIN SAID THE FIRST 
ISSUE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
RAISED WAS ELECTION MEDDLING. 
>>REPORTER:  I GUESS THE 
QUESTION IS AT THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T 
HIGHLIGHT ANY OF THE MALIGNED 
ACTIVITIES THAT YOU HAVE AND 
THAT HIS ADVISERS HAVE. 
AND SO SHOULD AMERICANS BELIEVE 
THAT HE IS LISTENING TO YOUR 
ADVICE OR THAT HE IS GOING HIS 
OWN WAY WHEN HE'S HAVING 
MEETINGS LIKE HE DID WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA? 
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS 
MADE IT IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR TO 
EVERYBODY WHO HAS A 
RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS AREA 
THAT HE CARES DEEPLY ABOUT IT 
AND THAT HE EXPECTS THEM TO DO 
THEIR JOBS TO THEIR FULLEST 
ABILITY AND THAT HE SUPPORTS 
THEM FULLY. 
>> SARAH, I BELIEVE THIS IS FOR 
DIRECTOR COATS. 
SINCE SOCIAL MEDIA WAS BROUGHT 
UP, THERE WAS A RECENT CASE 
WITH FACEBOOK HAVING RECENTLY 
SHUT DOWN 32 ACCOUNTS BELIEVED 
POTENTIALLY TO BE FROM RUSSIA. 
CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA, IS 
THAT A LARGE AMOUNT, IS THAT A 
-- IS THAT JUST KIND OF THE TIP 
OF THE ICEBERG? 
AND THEN GENERALLY SPEAKING 
WITH THESE SOCIAL MEDIA 
COMPANIES, FACEBOOK, TWITTER, 
INSTAGRAM, HOW MUCH HAVE THEY 
PROGRESSED OR HAVE THEY NOT 
PROGRESSED IN WHAT YOU WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE IN TERMS OF 
PROGRESSION FROM 2016 IN 
IDENTIFYING THE THREAT? 
>> FIRST I'M NOT GOING TO 
DISCUSS ANY SPECIFIC ONGOING 
INVESTIGATION. 
BUT WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS 
THAT ACTIVITY OF THE SORT 
YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS A GOOD 
REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT WE 
HAVE TO HAVE A PUBLIC/PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIP IN THIS PARTICULAR 
THREAT, AND THAT'S WHY WHEN I 
TALKED ABOUT OUR THREE PILLARS 
OF THE F.B.I.'S FOREIGN 
INFLUENCE TASK FORCE, WE'RE 
SPENDING SO MUCH OF OUR EFFORT 
TRYING TO ENGAGE WITH THE 
SOCIAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGY 
COMPANIES BECAUSE THERE IS A 
VERY IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THEM TO 
PLAY IN TERMS OF MONITORING AND 
IN EFFECT POLICING THEIR OWN 
PLATFORMS. 
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE HAPPEN 
WHICH STARTED HAPPENING IN A 
WAY WHICH IS MUCH MORE ROBUST, 
MUCH MORE ROBUST THAN IN BEFORE 
THE 2016 ELECTION, WE'RE 
SHARING WITH THEM ACTIONABLE 
INTELLIGENCE IN A WAY THAT 
WASN'T HAPPENING BEFORE. 
WE UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT THEY 
NEED, THEY'RE SHARING 
INFORMATION BACK WITH US BASED 
ON WHAT THEY FIND. 
THERE ARE THINGS THAT THEY CAN 
DO ON THEIR PLATFORMS 
VOLUNTARILY IN TERMS OF TERMS 
OF USE AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T 
HAVE A ROLE IN. 
BUT IN TURN WE LEARN THINGS 
FROM THEM, AND WE CAN USE THAT 
TO HAVE OUR INVESTIGATIONS BE 
MORE EFFECTIVE. 
SO I DO THINK PROGRESS IS BEING 
MADE. 
WE GOTTA KEEP GETTING BETTER AT 
IT, WE GOTTA KEEP STAYING ON 
THE BALLS OF OUR FEET, BUT I 
THINK THAT IS WHAT WE ARE 
SEEING. 
>>REPORTER:  AMBASSADOR BOLTON, 
YOU TALK ABOUT ORDERING THE 
CLOSURE OF THE CONSULATES IN 
SAN FRANCISCO AND SEATTLE, 
THESE ARE TWO TECH HUBS, WHAT 
HAPPENED THERE THAT LED YOU TO 
DO THAT? 
>> WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO 
DISCUSS THE BACKGROUND OF THAT 
DECISION WHICH ACTUALLY 
OCCURRED BEFORE I CAME TO THIS 
JOB, BUT THE PURPOSE OF 
EXPELLING THE RUSSIAN 
INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE EXPELLED 
WAS TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO 
RUSSIA THAT THEIR CONDUCT IN 
CONDUCTING A CHEMICAL WEAPONS 
ATTACK IN GREAT BRITAIN WAS 
UNACCEPTABLE, AND THIS WAS A 
MODE OF RETALIATION DESIGNED TO 
SHOW THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE 
THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY ON THE 
TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES 
OR ANY OF OUR ALLIES, AND WE 
EXPELLED A LOT OF THE PEOPLE 
WHO WE THINK HAD KNOWLEDGE OF 
IT OR HAD OTHER ACTIVITIES IN 
THE UNITED STATES THAT WE 
CONSIDERED UNACCEPTABLE. 
>>REPORTER:  THIS I GUESS WOULD 
BE MAYBE FOR SECRETARY NIELSEN 
OR FOR MR. WRAY. 
THESE MEDDLING CAMPAIGNS SEEM 
TO FALL INTO TWO BROAD 
CATEGORIES, THIS SORT OF 
INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS WHICH 
CHALLENGE THE INFORMATION UPON 
WHICH AMERICANS USE TO MAKE 
THEIR DETERMINATIONS, AND THEN 
THE MORE PHYSICAL INTERFERENCES 
INTO THE MACHINERY OF VOTING, 
TABULATION OF VOTING, THE VOTER 
ROLLS, THE MACHINERY THAT THE 
STATES RUN. 
CAN YOU GUYS DESCRIBE WHAT 
YOU'RE SEEING SPECIFICALLY IN 
THE RUNUP TO THIS COMING 
ELECTION IN BOTH OF THOSE 
AREAS? 
DO YOU WORRY MORE ABOUT ONE 
THAN THE OTHER? 
ARE THERE SPECIFIC THREATS THAT 
MAYBE YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT 
BUT THAT YOU CAN SAY THERE HAVE 
BEEN SPECIFIC THREATS IN BOTH 
OF THOSE CATEGORIES SO THAT -- 
AND HOW SHOULD AMERICANS 
PROCESS THAT WHERE WE'RE GOING 
TO GO TO THE POLLS IN A FEW 
MONTHS? 
SHOULD PEOPLE BE CONFIDENT THAT 
WHEN THEY PULL THE LEVER 
THEY'RE SECURE? 
>> WELL, I THINK WE'VE SAID 
THIS FAIRLY CONSISTENTLY THAT 
IN THE CONTEXT OF 2018 WE ARE 
NOT YET SEEING THE SAME KIND OF 
EFFORTS TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET 
ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE, YOU 
KNOW, VOTER REGISTRATION 
DATABASES IN PARTICULAR. 
WHAT WE ARE SEEING ARE THE 
MALIGNED INFLUENCE OPERATIONS, 
IN EFFECT INFORMATION WARFARE 
THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT, AND 
THAT'S A 24/7, 365 DAYS A YEAR 
PHENOMENON THAT DOESN'T TURN 
NECESSARILY ON WHETHER OR NOT 
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN 
ELECTION SEASON OR NOT. 
BUT AS DIRECTOR COATS SAID, ANY 
MOMENT IS JUST A MOMENT BEFORE, 
YOU KNOW, THE DIAL CAN BE 
TURNED UP ONE, MUCH AS WE SAW 
IN 2016. 
AGAIN, NOT IN TERMS OF 
EFFECTING THE VOTE COUNT, BUT 
IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL 
PENETRATION OF VOTER 
REGISTRATION DATABASES OR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 
AND THAT IN TURN CAN BE A 
VEHICLE FOR THEM TO TRY TO SOW 
DISCORD OR UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE 
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE 
PUSHING BACK ON IT WHICH IS 
WHAT WE'RE DOING. 
>>REPORTER:  JUST TO -- 
>> JUST TO ADD, SO THE WAY 
WE'RE SPLITTING IT, WE ARE ALL 
PARTNERING TOGETHER, BUT YOUR 
QUESTION DISHES A LITTLE BIT OF 
THE DIVISION OF LABOR. 
SO JUST FOCUSED ON THE ELECTION 
INFRASTRUCTURE, IN TERMS OF 
STATE AND LOCALS THAT HAVE THE 
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY AND THEN 
WE ACCOUNT FOR THE F.B.I.'S 
EFFORT IN COUNTERING THE 
INFLUENCE. 
WITH REGARD TO THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE PIECE, WE HAVE 
SEEN A WILLINGNESS AND A 
CAPABILITY ON THE PART OF THE 
RUSSIANS, AND SO WE ARE WORKING 
VERY CLOSELY WITH STATE AND 
LOCALS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE 
PREPARED THIS TIME AROUND. 
PART OF THAT IS ENCOURAGING 
STATES TO HAVE AUDITTABILITY, 
SO TO GET TO THAT ONE PART OF 
YOUR QUESTION, WHATEVER 
HAPPENS, WE WANT TO ASSURE 
AMERICANS THE DAY AFTER THAT 
THEIR VOTE WAS COUNTED AND IT 
WAS COUNTED ORRECTLY. 
SO REGARDLESS OF WHAT MIGHT 
HAPPEN, WE WILL BE PREPARED. 
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE 
WE HAVE THAT AUDIT ABILITY. 
>>REPORTER:  SECRETARY NIELSEN, 
WILL A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN ON 
OCTOBER 1st AFFECT ANY OF THESE 
EFFORTS? 
>> SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS IN 
2017D.H.S. 
DESIGNATED ELECTION 
INFRASTRUCTURE, CRITICAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE SUBSECTOR. 
SO WE PRIORITIZE EFFORTS, SO 
ANY STATE THAT REQUESTS A 
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT, A 
HUNT TEAM, BEST PRACTICES, 
HYGIENE SCANS, ET CETERA, WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE 
WITHIN OUR BUDGET. 
SO THANK YOU. 
>> WE'LL TAKE ONE LAST 
QUESTION. 
>>REPORTER:  THIS IS FOR THE 
GENERAL. 
CAN YOU UNPACK A LITTLE BIT 
MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID? 
YOU SAID -- THE QUESTION FOR 
THE DIRECTOR AND THE QUESTION 
FOR THE GENERAL ARE SEPARATE. 
CAN YOU GIVE US A BETTER SENSE 
OF WHO SPECIFICALLY HAS BEEN 
TARGETED? 
WE KNOW THESE TWO SENATORS HAVE 
SAID THAT THEY'VE BEEN TARGETED 
BY HACKING OR BY PEOPLE 
IMPERSONATING GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS. 
IS IT MEMBERS OF THE SENATE, 
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE, IS IT 
DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN 
CAMPAIGNS? 
AND THEN A SEPARATE QUESTION 
FOR THE GENERAL. 
>> WE FOLLOW A PROCEDURE THAT'S 
BEEN AGREED ON SOME TIME AGO IN 
TERMS OF WHEN WE RECEIVE THIS 
TYPE OF INFORMATION IT IS 
PROCESSED THROUGH THE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE RESPECTIVE 
HOUSE CHAMBER, SENATE CHAMBER, 
AND THEN DISSEMINATED DOWN TO 
THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER WHO WAS 
TARGETED. 
SO WE HAVE TAKEN THAT ACTION 
THAT IS IN PLACE, BUT I'M NOT 
IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW TO 
RELEASE THOSE NAMES. 
>>REPORTER:  WOULD YOU SUPPORT 
LEGISLATION IMPOSING SANCTIONS 
ON RUSSIA NOW THAT YOU'RE 
SAYING THEY HAVE IN FACT 
INTERFERED? 
>> WELL, WE ALREADY HAVE THOSE 
-- A LOT OF SANCTIONS IN PLACE, 
AND I WOULD SUPPORT ANY EFFORTS 
THAT WE CAN COLLECTIVELY PUT 
TOGETHER TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO 
RUSSIA THAT THERE IS A COST, A 
PRICE TO PAY FOR WHAT THEY'RE 
DOING, AND IF WE WANT TO HAVE 
ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP 
WHATSOEVER IN DEALING WITH 
THINGS OF MUTUAL INTEREST, THE 
RUSSIANS HAVE TO STOP DOING 
WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR IT'S 
SIMPLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. 
>>REPORTER:  GENERAL, HAVE YOU 
BEEN ORDERED AT ALL, OR 
AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT ANY 
OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS IN 
RESPONSE TO THIS? 
>> SO MY GUIDANCE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE IS VERY CLEAR. 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT 
MEDDLING IN THE ELECTIONS AND 
IT'S VERY UNAMBIGUOUS. 
>>REPORTER:  SANCTIONS FOR THE 
13 RUSSIANS THAT WERE INDICTED. 
>> THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 
WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING 
HERE TODAY. 
>> WE'LL TAKE A COUPLE MORE 
QUESTIONS ON OTHER TOPICS 
TODAY. 
JOE, GO AHEAD. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT'S TWEET ON NORTH 
KOREA. 
HE WAS ADDRESSING KIM JONG-UN, 
AND HE SAID, QUOTE, I LOOK 
FORWARD TO SEEING YOU SOON. 
ARE THERE PLANS IN PLACE RIGHT 
NOW, ANYTHING ABOUT A SECOND 
MEETING AND ALSO HE SAID HE 
RECEIVED A LETTER FROM KIM. 
WHAT DID THE LETTER SAY, AND 
DID IT ADDRESS ANY OF THE 
REPORTS THAT APPEAR TO SHOW 
THAT KIM IS NOT ACTUALLY 
WORKING TOWARDS TO 
DENUCLEARIZATION? 
>> THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
ROLLED INTO ONE. 
I'LL TRY TO ADDRESS EACH ONE. 
IF I MISS SOMETHING, I'M SURE 
YOU GUYS WILL POINT IT OUT. 
I DID RECEIVE A LETTER. 
I BELIEVE HE RECEIVED IT ON 
AUGUST 1st. 
THERE IS NOT A SECOND MEETING 
THAT IS CURRENTLY LOCKED IN OR 
FINALIZED, CERTAINLY OPEN TO 
THAT DISCUSSION, BUT THERE 
ISN'T A MEETING PLANNED. 
WE HAVE RESPONDED TO CHAIRMAN 
KIM'S LETTER, THE PRESIDENT 
HAS, AND THAT LETTER WILL BE 
DELIVERED SHORTLY. 
BEYOND THAT, I CAN'T GET INTO 
ANY FURTHER DETAILS. 
>>REPORTER:  HAS HE ADDRESSED 
THE CONCERNS -- 
>> I CAN SAY THAT THE LETTERS 
ADDRESSED THEIR COMMITMENT FROM 
THEIR JOINT STATEMENT THAT WAS 
MADE AT THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE 
WORKING TOGETHER TOWARDS 
COMPLETE AND TOTAL 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
AGAIN, I CAN'T GO ANY FURTHER 
THAN WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU. 
>>REPORTER:  IVANKA TRUMP MADE 
TWO STATEMENTS THIS MORNING AT 
ODDS IN THE POSITION OF HER 
FATHER. 
SHE SAID THE MEDIA ARE NOT THE 
ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE AND ALSO 
CALLED THE SEPARATION AT THE 
BORDER THE LOW POINT. 
WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT THINK 
OF THAT? 
>>REPORTER:  THE PRESIDENT 
HIMSELF HAS STATED THAT HE 
DOESN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF FAMILY 
SEPARATION. 
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DOES. 
WE ALSO DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF 
OPEN BORDERS, WE DON'T LIKE THE 
IDEA OF ALLOWING PEOPLE INTO 
OUR COUNTRY IF WE DON'T KNOW 
WHO THEY ARE, WHERE THEY'RE 
GOING AND WHY THEY'RE COMING. 
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO SECURE 
OR BORDERS WHICH IS WHY HE HAS 
ASKED CONGRESS TO FIX THE LAW. 
WE HAVEN'T BEEN UNCLEAR ABOUT 
WHAT OUR POSITION IS HERE. 
WE WANT TO SECURE THE BORDERS, 
WE WANT TO CHANGE THE LAW. 
IT'S CONGRESS' JOB TO DO THAT. 
WE'D LIKE THEM, PARTICULARLY 
DEMOCRATS TO STOP PLAYING 
POLITICAL GAMES AND STEP UP AND 
DO THEIR JOBS. 
>>REPORTER:  INAUDIBLE  ] 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHTFULLY 
FRUSTRATED. 
90% OF THE COVERAGE ON HIM IS 
NEGATIVE DESPITE THE FACT THAT 
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, ISIS IS 
ON THE RUN AND AMERICAN 
LEADERSHIP IS BEING REASSERTED 
AROUND THE WORLD. 
JUST THIS WEEK THE MEDIA 
REFUSED TO COVER HIS REMARKS IN 
FLORIDA, HIGHLIGHTING EFFORTS 
ON WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT. 
IN FACT, THE PULLER FOR THE 
PRESS SAID THERE WAS NO NEWS 
MADE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE 
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE JOINED 
WITH DOZENS OF BUSINESSES 
ACROSS THE STATE OF FLORIDA TO 
ANNOUNCE THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS. 
THAT MAY NOT BE NEWS IN 
WASHINGTON D.C., BUT I CAN 
ASSURE YOU THAT IT'S NEWS IN 
THE STATE OF FLORIDA THAT 
PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE A JOB 
BEFORE THIS PRESIDENT TOOK 
OFFICE HAVE BETTER OPPORTUNITY 
AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A 
JOB MOVING FORWARD, THAT'S 
ACTUALLY REAL NEWS AND 
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE IN THE 
STATE OF FLORIDA AND ACROSS 
THIS COUNTRY APPRECIATE. 
AND THAT WAS TOTALLY IGNORED. 
NOT ONLY THAT, BEFORE A 
JOURNALIST ON CNN CLAIMED THAT 
THE PRESIDENT HADN'T TAKEN 
QUESTIONS IN OVER A WEEK 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT SAME 
JOURNALIST DID A LIVE SHOT FROM 
THE TWO AND TWO PRESS 
CONFERENCE THAT THE PRESIDENT 
HAD WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF 
ITALY JUST MOMENTS AFTER MAKING 
THAT ACCUSATION. 
WITH THIS SORT OF 
MISINFORMATION AND LACK OF 
INTEREST THAT'S SO PERVASIVE IN 
THE MEDIA, IT'S COMPLETELY 
UNDERSTANDABLE FOR THE 
PRESIDENT TO BE FRUSTRATED. 
JOHN DECKER, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  THANKS A LOT, 
SARAH. 
I WANTED  TO ASK YOU ABOUT A 
CONFERENCE CALL THAT TOOK PLACE 
YESTERDAY INVOLVING U.S./CHINA 
TRADE RELATIONS. 
IS THERE A TIME LINE AS TO WHEN 
OR IF THE PRESIDENT MAY PULL 
THE TRIGGER AND IMPOSE HARSHER 
SANCTIONS ON CHINA, HAR SHALLER 
TARIFFS ON CHINA? 
>> WE'RE CONTINUING TO MONITOR 
THAT PROCESS, AND WHEN WE HAVE 
AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON THAT, WE'LL 
CERTAINLY LET YOU KNOW. 
>>REPORTER:  IS THE GOAL AT THE 
END OF THE DAY -- REALLY 
QUICKLY, IS THE GOAL AT THE END 
OF THE DAY TO GET CHINA BACK TO 
THE NEGOTIATING TABLE THE WAY 
THEY WERE AT THE NEGOTIATING 
TABLE WITH AMERICAN TRADE 
OFFICIALS JUST A FEW MONTHS 
AGO? 
>> THE GOAL AT THE END OF THE 
DAY IS TO END THE UNFAIR TRADE 
PRACTICES THAT CHINA HAS 
ENGAGED IN FOR DECADES AND THAT 
THE ADMINISTRATIONS BEFORE THIS 
PRESIDENT HAVE IGNORED. 
JONATHAN. 
>>REPORTER:  CONCERNING THE 
QUESTION ABOUT ELECTION 
SECURITY, THE PRESIDENT HAS 
SAID OTHER PEOPLE ALSO MAY HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED IN THE EFFORTS TO 
INTERFERE WITH THE 2016 
ELECTION. 
DID ANY OF THE PEOPLE WE SAW UP 
HERE, HAS THERE BEEN ANY 
EVIDENCE FROM THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY THAT THERE WERE 
OTHERS BESIDES RUSSIA THAT WERE 
INVOLVED IN ELECTION MEDDLING? 
>> CERTAINLY WE KNOW THERE WERE 
OTHERS, AND WE KNOW THAT THERE 
ARE OTHERS THAT ARE CONSIDERING 
MAKING ATTEMPTS IN 2018 WHICH 
IS WHAT OUR FOCUS IS MOVING 
FORWARD. 
AS YOU KNOW, NONE OF US WERE 
HERE IN 2016, BUT WE'RE HERE 
NOW AND THE INDIVIDUALS THAT 
WERE STANDING UP HERE JUST 
MOMENTS AGO, THE FOCUS AND THE 
FULL WEIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT 
ASKED BY THE PRESIDENT AND 
DIRECTED BY THE PRESIDENT IS TO 
PROTECT THE ELECTION 
INFRASTRUCTURE IN 2018 AND 
MOVING FORWARD, AND THAT'S 
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. 
>>REPORTER:  WHO WERE THE 
OTHERS THAT WERE INVOLVED? 
>> I CAN'T GET INTO SPECIFIC 
DETAILS. 
BUT OUR INTELLIGENCE SHOWS THAT 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHERS 
THAT ARE LOOKING AT AND 
CONSIDERING ENGAGING 
PARTICULARLY IN 2018. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU ALSO SAID THAT 
THEY'RE TRYING TO HELP 
DEMOCRATS. 
YOU SUGGESTED THAT THE RUSSIANS 
WOULD BE TRYING TO HELP 
DEMOCRATS IN THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS. 
HAS THERE BEEN ANY EVIDENCE 
WHATSOEVER THE DEMOCRATS ARE -- 
THE RUSSIANS ARE TRYING TO HELP 
DEMOCRATS IN 2018? 
>> I THINK YOU CAN SEE JUST 
FROM WHAT TOOK PLACE OVER IN 
THE FACEBOOK. 
I KNOW DIRECTOR WRAY WASN'T AT 
LIBERTY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE 
SPECIFIC, AND I CAN'T GET INTO 
A LOT OF THEM, BUT I CAN TELL 
YOU A NUMBER OF THEM WERE ANTI-
PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND THAT 
CERTAINLY ISN'T HELPING 
REPUBLICANS. 
JOHN. 
I'M SORRY. 
I DID, I CALLED YOU. 
GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  I WANTED TO 
RESPOND -- YOU TO RESPOND IF 
YOU COULD ABOUT THE CAFE 
STANDARD RULE THAT WAS IMPOSED 
BY THE ADMINISTRATION TODAY, 
THERE ARE 20 STATE ATTORNEYS 
GENERALS THAT WOULD SUE THE 
ADMINISTRATION. 
PART OF THEIR COMPLAINT IS WE 
ARE WEAKENING THESE STANDARDS, 
PUTTING COMMUNITIES AT RISK. 
IT ALSO INCREASES THE RISK OF 
CLIMATE CHANGE FOR OUR STATES. 
THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE 
WOULD BE WHAT? 
>> THAT THE REPORTING THAT 
WE'RE REVERSING OBAMA-ERA FUEL 
EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND 
PREEMPTING THE TOUGHER 
CALIFORNIA STANDARDS IS SIMPLY 
FALSE. 
WHAT THE E.P.A. 
RELEASED YESTERDAY WAS A NOTICE 
OF PROPOSED RULE MAKING, NOT A 
FINAL RULE. 
THE NOTICE LAYS OUT A SERIES OF 
OPTIONS FOR HOW TO GO FORWARD 
WITH CAFE STANDARDS AND THE 
NOTICE ASKED FOR COMMENTS ON A 
RANGE OF OPTIONS. 
WE'RE SIMPLY OPENING IT UP FOR 
A COMMENT PERIOD AND WE'LL MAKE 
A FINAL DECISION AT THE END OF 
THAT. 
>>REPORTER:  FROM 10% TO 25%? 
>> I'M SORRY? 
>>REPORTER:  ON THE MOVE ON 
TARIFFS POTENTIALLY FROM 10% TO 
25%, WHAT WAS THE THING THAT 
MADE THE PRESIDENT SAY THIS IS 
WHY I WANT TO DO IT? 
>> AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT HAS 
BEEN CLEAR. 
HE'S GOING TO HOLD CHINA'S FEET 
TO THE FIRE, AND HE WANTS TO 
STOP THE UNFAIR TRADE 
PRACTICES. 
>>REPORTER:  CAN I GET A 
QUESTION TO YOU? 
>> WE'LL COME TO YOU NEXT JIM. 
>>REPORTER:  GOING BACK TO 
ELECTION SECURITY, THE OTHER 
NIGHT IN TAMPA THE PRESIDENT 
MENTIONED VOTER I.D. 
FOR ELECTIONS. 
GOING FORWARD IS THE 
ADMINISTRATION LOOKING AT 
PROPOSING A VOTER I.D. 
LAW OR I.D. 
LAW OR PUSHING A VOTER I.D. 
LAW? 
>> I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS THE LAST 
PART OF YOUR QUESTION? 
THERE'S A LOT OF FEEDBACK. 
>>REPORTER:  IF THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS PART OF THIS 
ELECTION SECURITY PUSH ALSO 
LOOKING TO DO A VOTER I.D. 
LAW TO TRY TO PUSH SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT THROUGH CONGRESS? 
>> WE'RE LOOKING TO DO 
EVERYTHING WE CAN AT THIS POINT 
TO PROTECT THE 2018 ELECTIONS, 
THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE 
ELECTIONS AND MOVING ON BEYOND 
2018 TO 2020 AND AFTER. 
WE HAVEN'T MADE A FINAL 
DECISION, BUT CERTAINLY LOOKING 
AT EVERY OPTION AVAILABLE TO 
US. 
IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE IF I 
RETURN SOMETHING TO A 
DEPARTMENT STORE, IF I HAVE TO 
CASH A CHECK, I HAVE TO SHOW MY 
I.D. 
IN ORDER TO DO THOSE THINGS. 
IT'S NOT OUTRAGEOUS THAT IF 
YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE TO DECIDE 
ON WHO THE LEADERS OF THE LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES, YOUR STATE AND THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE GOING TO 
BE THAT YOU WOULD BE ASKED TO 
SHOW AN I.D. 
JIM. 
>>REPORTER:  I JUST WANTED TO 
FOLLOW U ON SARAH'S QUESTION 
FROM NPR. 
SHE ASKED YOU ABOUT IVANKA 
TRUMP'S STATEMENT THAT THE 
PRESS IS NOT THE ENEMY OF THE 
PEOPLE, AND SHE ASKED YOU 
WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESS IS THE 
ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. 
YOU READ OFF A LAUNDRY LIST OF 
YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRESS, 
AND THEN THINGS THAT YOU FEEL 
LIKE ARE MISREPORTED. 
BUT YOU DID NOT SAY THAT THE 
PRESS IS NOT THE ENEMY OF THE 
PEOPLE. 
I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD 
THING IF YOU WERE TO SAY RIGHT 
HERE AT THIS BRIEFING THAT THE 
PRESS, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
GATHERED IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW 
DOING THEIR JOBS EVERYDAY, 
ASKING QUESTIONS OF OFFICIALS 
LIKE THE ONES YOU BROUGHT 
FORWARD EARLIER ARE NOT THE 
ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE, I THINK WE 
DESERVE THAT. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS 
POSITION KNOWN. 
I ALSO THINK IT'S IRONIC -- 
>>REPORTER:  WOULD YOU MIND 
TELLING US -- 
>> I'M TRYING TO ANSWER YOUR 
QUESTION. 
I POLITELY WAITED WHEN YOU 
INTERRUPTED ON YOUR COLLEAGUE. 
>>REPORTER:  WHICH IS WHY I 
INTERRUPTED. 
>> I'M TRYING. 
>>REPORTER:  IF YOU WOULD NOT 
MIND LETTING ME HAVE A 
FOLLOWUP, THAT WOULD BE FINE. 
>> IT'S IRONIC, JIM, THAT NOT 
ONLY YOU AND THE MEDIA ATTACK 
THE PRESIDENT FOR HIS RHETORIC 
WHEN THEY FREQUENTLY LOWER THE 
LEVEL OF CONVERSATION IN THIS 
COUNTRY, REPEATEDLY, REPEATEDLY 
THE MEDIA RESORTS TO PERSONAL 
ATTACKS WITHOUT ANY CONTENT 
OTHER THAN TO INCITE ANGER. 
THE MEDIA HAS ATTACKED ME 
PERSONALLY ON A NUMBER OF 
OCCASIONS, INCLUDING YOUR OWN 
NETWORK, SAID I SHOULD BE 
HARASSED AS A LIFE SENTENCE, 
THAT I SHOULD BE CHOKED. 
I.C.E. 
OFFICIALS ARE NOT WELCOME IN 
THEIR PLACE OF WORSHIP AND 
PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SHARED 
ON THE INTERNET. 
WHEN I WAS HOSTED BY THE 
CORRESPONDENTS' ASSOCIATION OF 
WHICH ALMOST ALL OF YOU ARE 
MEMBERS OF, YOU BROUGHT A 
COMEDIAN UP TO ATTACK MY 
APPEARANCE AND CALL IMMEDIATE A 
TRAITOR TO MY OWN GENDER. 
IN FACT, AS I KNOW, I'M -- AS 
FAR AS I KNOW, I'M THE FIRST 
PRESS SECRETARY IN THE HISTORY 
OF THE UNITED STATES THAT'S 
REQUIRED SECRET SERVICE 
PROTECTION. 
THE MEDIA CONTINUES TO RATCHET 
UP THE VERBAL ASSAULT AGAINST 
THE PRESIDENT AND EVERYONE IN 
THIS ADMINISTRATION, AND 
CERTAINLY WE HAVE A ROLE TO 
PLAY, BUT THE MEDIA HAS A ROLE 
TO PLAY FOR THE DISCOURSE IN 
THIS COUNTRY AS WELL. 
>> AND, SARAH, IF YOU DON'T 
MIND -- IF I MAY FOLLOW UP. 
EXCUSE ME. 
YOU DID NOT SAY IN THE COURSE 
OF THOSE REMARKS THAT YOU JUST 
MADE THAT THE PRESS IS NOT THE 
ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. 
ARE WE TO TALK IT FROM WHAT YOU 
JUST SAID -- WE ALL GET PUT 
THROUGH THE RINGER, WE GET PUT 
IN THE MEAT GRINDER IN THIS 
TOWN AND YOU'RE NO EXCEPTION. 
I'M SORRY THAT HAPPENED TO YOU. 
I WISH THAT WOULD NOT HAVE 
HAPPENED. 
BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THIS ROOM, 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS 
ROOM, THIS DEMOCRACY, THIS 
COUNTRY, ALL THE PEOPLE AROUND 
THE WORLD ARE WATCHING WHAT 
YOU'RE SAYING, SARAH, AND THE 
WHITE HOUSE FOR THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA, THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
SHOULD NOT REFER TO US AS THE 
ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. 
HIS OWN DAUGHTER ACKNOWLEDGES 
THAT AND ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO 
DO, SARAH, IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE 
THAT RIGHT NOW AND RIGHT HERE. 
>> I APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION. 
I SHARE IT. 
I'VE ADDRESSED THIS QUESTION, 
I'VE ADDRESSED MY PERSONAL 
FEELINGS. 
I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF 
THE PRESIDENT. 
HE'S MADE HIS COMMENTS CLEAR. 
>>REPORTER:  ON ANOTHER MATTER, 
THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES TOLD THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
CHAIRMAN TODAY THEY PROBABLY 
AREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
FINISH UP THEIR DOCUMENT 
COLLECTION REGARDING BRETT 
KAANAUGH UNTIL OCTOBER. 
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY LATER THAN THE 
TIMETABLE YOU GUYS AND SENATE 
REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING FOR. 
CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT OR ANY 
POTENTIAL ASSISTANCE THAT THE 
WHITE HOUSE CAN GIVE THE 
ARCHIVES OF ACCELERATING THAT? 
>> CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BE AS 
HELPFUL AS POSSIBLE IN TURNING 
OVER AS MANY DOCUMENTS. 
SEVERAL SENATORS HAVE STATED 
THERE WILL BE UP TO AN OVER A 
MILLION PAGES OF DOCUMENTS TO 
REVIEW, INCLUDING OVER 300 
JUDICIAL OPINIONS, HIS 
DOCUMENTS OF STAFF SECRETARY 
TELL US THE LEAST ABOUT HIS 
JUDICIAL THINKING THEN A 
MILLION PAGES FROM HIS OTHER 
INCLUDING HIS JUDICIAL 
OPINIONS. 
WE WANT A THOROUGH EVALUATION. 
WE'VE ASKED FOR THIS, BUT WE 
DON'T WANT A TAXPAYER-FUNDED 
FISHING EXPEDITION. 
WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE 
COOPERATIVE AND THAT'S WHAT WE 
ARE GOING TO DO. 
A LAST QUESTION. 
JORDAN. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, SARAH. 
I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE 
OTHER QUESTION. 
ON NORTH KOREA, WE'RE 
. 
>>> AND WE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
WORK WITH NORTH KOREA. 
THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO CLOSE 
OUT. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH GUYS. 
HAVE A GREAT DAY. 
>>  SANCTION THE 13 RUSSIANS 
THAT WERE INDICTED LIKE YOU DID 
THE 12 BEFORE. 
>>  SARAH SANDERS HEAD OF THIS 
BRIEFING, AT THE TOP OF THIS 
BRIEFING WE SAW A HOST OF 
CHIEFS, FBI, NSA, CIA ALL COME 
TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF MIDTERM ELECTIONS 
AND SECURING AND MAKING SURE 
THEY ARE IN FACT SAFE AND HACK. 
EACH OF THEM WENT TO GREAT 
LENGTHS TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE 
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND 
WHAT THE TILL AGAINST AGENCIES 
ARE DOING. 
THEY ALSO SAID THERE IS A 
CONTINUED -- THE WORDS OF DNI 
DIRECTOR DAN COATS, IT'S 
ONGOING, AND IT'S CONTINUING. 
THAT THERE IS A CONTINUED 
THREAT. 
THEY DID GO ONTO SAY IT WASN'T 
AS BAD AS IT WAS IN 2016 BUT IT 
IS HAPPENING. 
THEY WANTED TO SEND A MESSAGE 
THAT THEY ARE ALL WORKING ON 
THIS IN A COORDINATED EFFORT TO 
TRY TO GET THE RESOURCES ON A 
NATIONAL AND STATE LEVEL TO 
MAKE SURE THE ELECTIONS COME 
NOVEMBER WILL BE IN FACT 
SECURED AND THERE WON'T BE 
INTERFERENCE. 
I WANT TO BRING IN ED AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING 
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE BROUGHT 
OUT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS. 
HOW DO THEY GO WITH THE FACT 
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS CALLING 
FOR THE RUSSIA PROBE TO END 
WHEN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
IS SAYING IT'S STILL ONGOING? 
>>  WE TRIED ASKING THAT AND 
DIDN'T GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER. 
IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE THEM 
HERE IN THE BRIEFING ROOM 
DESCRIBING THE SERIOUSNESS AND 
WHAT IS HAPPENING REGARDING 
RUSSIAN ATTEMPTS TO CLUB THE 
RUSSIAN ELECTION AND YET THEIR 
BOSS FEELS DIFFERENTLY AND IS 
NOT WILLING TO GO AS FAR AS 
THEY HAVE, ESPECIALLY DIRECTLY 
TO THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT. 
>>  I WANT TO PLAY SOUND FOR 
YOU FROM THE DIRECTOR OF 
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. 
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT RUSSIAN 
INTERFERENCE IN UNITED STATES 
ELECTIONS. 
>>  THE PRESIDENT HAS 
SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED US TO 
MAKE THE MATTER OF THE ELECTION 
MEDDLING AND SECURING OUR 
ELECTION PROCESS A TOP PRIORITY 
AND WE HAVE DONE THAT AND ARE 
DOING THAT AND WILL CONTINUE TO 
DO SO. 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
CONTINUES TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE THREATS OF UPCOMING UNITED 
STATES ELECTIONS, BOTH THE 
MIDTERMS AND THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION IN 2020. 
IN REGARDS TO RUSSIAN 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS, WE CONTINUE TO SEE A 
CAMPAIGN TO TRY TO WEAKEN AND 
DIVIDE THE UNITED STATES. 
>>  THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY IS CONCERNED. 
IS THE PRESIDENT CONCERNED? 
>>  REMEMBER WE HAVE SEEN HIM 
TALK ABOUT THIS NOT AS 
FORCEFULLY AND DIRECTLY AS 
COATS DID THERE AND SO WE WILL 
SEE IF HE HAS ANYTHING TO SAY 
ABOUT THIS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
OR HOURS. 
CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, SENDING 
THEM OUT HERE IS A SIGNAL THAT 
THE ADMINISTRATION SEPARATE 
FROM THE PRESIDENT IS TAKING 
THIS SERIOUSLY AND CONTINUES TO 
WORK ON IT. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS. 
THEY DIDN'T SAY THEY WERE 
COMING TO DO IT BUT THEY HAVE. 
THEY OUTLINED SPECIFICALLY -- 
NOT NECESSARILY SPECIFICALLY 
BUT THEY OUTLINED WHAT IT IS 
THEY ARE DOING. 
I THINK ONE OF THE MORE NOTABLE 
ASPECTS OF THIS, YOU HAD THE 
GENERAL HEAD OF CYBER COMMAND 
SAY, PRETTY CLEARLY THAT THEY 
HAVE BEEN TOLD IF NEED BE THEY 
CAN TAKE ACTIONS AGAINST ACTORS 
WHO MAY BE DOING THIS I ASKED 
THEM HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD TO TAKE 
OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS AGAINST 
ANYONE AND HE DIDN'T ANSWER IT 
DIRECTLY BUT CERTAINLY SIGNALED 
THERE THAT PERHAPS THEY HAD 
DONE THAT. 
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE IF 
WE LEARN MORE. 
>>  DO WE KNOW IF THE TACTICS 
ARE THE SAME THAT THEY USED IN 
2016 THAT THE ONES THAT THESE 
CYBER ATTACKS ARE EMPLOYING AT 
THIS CURRENT MOMENT? 
>>  THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. 
IT WAS ASKED AND YOU HEARD THE 
DIRECTOR SAY IT HASN'T BEEN TO 
THE SAME LEVEL AS WAS SEEN IN 
2016. 
HE HINTED IT'S ONLY AUGUST. 
WE HAVE A FEW MORE MONTHS TO GO 
LEAVING THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT 
MAY BE AT SOME POINT. 
IT HAS NOT BEEN AS INTENSE SO 
FAR AS IT WAS BACK IN 2016. 
AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE 
DIRECTOR. 
>>  I ALSO WANT TO SWITCH GEARS 
AND ASK YOU. 
THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON A 
POTENTIAL INTERVIEW WITH THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE RUSSIAN TEAM. 
DID WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT? 
>>  WE DID NOT. 
WE HAVE SEEN THE BACK AND FORTH 
ON IF IT'LL HAPPEN. 
THE PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY HAS 
SUGGESTED THAT IT WON'T BUT 
THERE WAS NO NEW GROUND ON THAT 
SO FAR TODAY. 
THEY HAD MADE PRETTY CLEAR IT 
WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT ELECTION 
INTERFERENCE AND NOT TO GET IN 
TO THE OTHER ISSUES. 
YOU KNOW AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL 
THE -- THE DEBATE CONTINUES 
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE 
PRESIDENT WILL DO IT. 
WE KNOW THAT HE HAS EXPRESSED A 
DESIRE TO DO IT BUT THERE'S NO 
WORD ON WHEN IT MAY HAPPEN IF 
AT ALL. 
>>  WE KNOW THE PRESS SECRETARY 
WAS ASKED ABOUT A POSSIBLE 
SECOND MEETING WITH NORTH 
KOREA. 
>>  SAID THERE'S NOTHING 
SCHEDULED AND THAT THEY ARE 
OPEN TO IT. 
THE PRESIDENT DID CONFIRM THIS 
MORNING IN A TWEET THAT HE HAD 
RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE 
NORTH KOREA CHAIRMAN SORT OF 
FOLLOWING UP ON THEIR MEETING 
IN SINGAPORE. 
THAT WAS THE PRESIDENT WAS 
THANKING CHAIRMAN KIM FOR 
RETURNING WHAT THEY SAY ARE 
REMAINS OF AMERICANS FROM THE 
KOREAN WAR THAT WERE RECEIVED 
OVERNIGHT IN HAWAII. 
THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS THERE 
FOR THAT AND THERE WAS A 
MILITARY CEREMONY THERE IN 
HAWAII.. 
THERE WAS A LETTER BUT THEY 
DIDN'T GET INTO SPECIFICS AND 
MADE CLEAR THERE ARE NO PLANS 
FOR A SECOND MEETING. 
>>  AND YOU ASKED ABOUT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIS 
NOMINATION AND DO WE THINK THAT 
HE WILL BE CONFIRMED BEFORE 
NOVEMBER? 
>>  BEFORE NOVEMBER. 
THAT'S THE KEY QUESTION NOW. 
THAT IS CERTAINLY THE GOAL OF 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND REPUBLICANS 
IN THE SENATE WHO WANT TO SEE 
HIM SEATED BY THE FIRST MONDAY 
IN OCTOBER WHEN THE COURT 
CONVENES FOR THEIR NEXT 
SESSION. 
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY IS THE 
NATIONAL ARCHIVES LET IT BE 
KNOWN THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE 
A DELAY IN PROVIDING ALL OF THE 
DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN 
REQUESTED REGARDING KAVANAUGH'S 
PREVIOUS WORK IN THE BUSH ERA 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, HERE AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE AS STAFF SECRETARY 
AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS THEY 
HAVE REQUESTED. 
THEY SAID THEY ARE LOOKING AT 
CLOSE TO 900,000 DOCUMENTS 
WHICH IS A MASSIVE NUMBER 
COMPARED TO CHIEF JUSTICE 
ROBERTS WHEN HE WAS CONSIDERED, 
THEY ONLY GAVE OVER 70,000 
DOCUMENTS. 
WHAT THEY SIGNALED IS WE DON'T 
NECESSARILY HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
DO THIS UNTIL OCTOBER WHICH 
WOULD EXCEED THE EXPECTATIONS, 
THE HOPES OF THE JUDGE'S 
SUPPORTERS. 
THE CURRENT THINKING IS A 
HEARING WOULD BE HELD IN 
SEPTEMBER AND A VOTE AFTER 
THAT. 
ALL INDICATIONS ARE AT THIS 
POINT THAT HE HAS ENOUGH 
SUPPORT AMONG REPUBLICANS AND 
NO DEMOCRAT HAS SIGNALED THEY 
WILL VOTE FOR HIM. 
>>  ALL RIGHT. 
>>> AS WE MENTIONED THE 
PRESIDENT HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN 
PUSHING HIS LEGAL TEAM TO 
COMMIT TO AN INTERVIEW WITH THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 
HIS ATTORNEYS HAVE BEEN 
NEGOTIATING THE TERMS FOR AN 
INTERVIEW FOR MONTHS INCLUDING 
WHICH TOPICS CAN BE COVERED AND 
THE FORMAT. 
HIS LAWYERS HAVE BEEN CAREFUL 
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS INDICATED 
HE WANTS TO DO IT. 
I HAVE ALWAYS
