1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,295
EARLIER THIS EVENING I SPOKE TO

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:04,163
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ERIC

3
00:00:04,163 --> 00:00:05,464
SWALWELL WHO SITS ON THE HOUSE

4
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:08,334
UNTIL COMMITTEE AND I GOT HIS

5
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:10,536
TAKE.

6
00:00:10,536 --> 00:00:12,404
YOU KNOW, GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW NOW

7
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:15,574
FROM THE IG REPORT WHICH CAUSED

8
00:00:15,574 --> 00:00:16,542
DIRECTOR COMEY INSUBORDINATE, IT

9
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:19,912
SAYS THAT WE FOUND IT WAS

10
00:00:19,912 --> 00:00:21,046
EXTRAORDINARY AND A SUBORDINATE

11
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:22,881
FOR COMEY TO CONCEAL HIS

12
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:23,849
INTENTIONS FROM HIS SUPERIORS.

13
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:27,052
IT GOES ON TO SAY HE USURPED THE

14
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:28,487
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND IT DID NOT

15
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,888
ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE LEGAL

16
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:31,657
POSITION OF THE DEPARTMENT

17
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,058
PROSECUTORS WHICH IS PRETTY

18
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:33,525
STRONG LANGUAGE.

19
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:36,028
SO GIVEN ALL THIS, DO YOU THINK

20
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:39,598
NOW, LOOKING BACK, BUT THE

21
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:41,266
PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT TO FIRE

22
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:41,667
JAMES COMEY?

23
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,702
>> NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

24
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:44,703
AND THIS PRESIDENT JUST WEEKS

25
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:46,872
BEFORE THE ELECTION WANTED TO

26
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:49,074
THROW A PARADE FOR JAMES COMEY.

27
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:51,110
HE AGREED WITH JAMES COMEY

28
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,710
REOPENING THE CLINTON

29
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,512
INVESTIGATION SO HE HAS NO

30
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,713
CREDIBILITY ON THIS.

31
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:57,549
THIS REPORT FOUND THERE WERE NO

32
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:59,718
CRIMES BY CLINTON, NO BIASED BY

33
00:00:59,718 --> 00:01:01,286
THE FBI AND SOMETHING THAT WE

34
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:02,988
ALL KNOW, JAMES COMEY IS AN

35
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:04,556
IMPERFECT MAN JUST LIKE WE ARE

36
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:06,692
ALL IMPERFECT PEOPLE AND HE

37
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,826
COULD HAVE DONE HIS JOB BETTER.

38
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:09,261
>> Martha: BUT WHEN YOU LOOK

39
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:11,096
BACK AT THIS, AND YOU LOOK AT

40
00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:13,165
THE MEMO, AND I KNOW THAT IT

41
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:14,366
BECAME COMPLICATED.

42
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:17,970
BUT THE MEMO THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN

43
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,204
WROTE SAID THAT THIS

44
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,406
INVESTIGATION WAS MISHANDLED AND

45
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:23,909
THAT WAS THE REASON THAT JAMES

46
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,979
COMEY NEEDED TO BE FIRED.

47
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:32,785
SO LOOKING BACK, THIS NOW

48
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,319
DOUBLES DOWN ON JAMES COMEY'S

49
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:34,820
ACTIONS.

50
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,754
AND THERE WOULD BE QUESTIONS

51
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:40,325
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT NEEDED

52
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,094
TO BE FIRED.

53
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:42,828
>> DO YOU THINK THAT

54
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:44,463
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS LYING FOR

55
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:44,897
LESTER HOLTZ?

56
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,899
HE TOLD LESTER HOLDS THAT HE

57
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,400
FIRED HIM BECAUSE OF THE

58
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,867
INVESTIGATION.

59
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:50,169
MAYBE THAT IS THE CASE, BUT I

60
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:53,105
THINK HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH

61
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:53,906
TO LESSER HOLDS.

62
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,107
>> Martha: HE HAS CITED A

63
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:56,809
NUMBER OF REASONS AND WE ARE ALL

64
00:01:56,809 --> 00:01:58,210
VERY AWARE OF THAT SOUND BITE.

65
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,379
I AGREE WITH YOU THAT HE

66
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:00,946
ABSOLUTELY SAID THAT.

67
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:03,015
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ROD

68
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:05,717
ROSENSTEIN MEMO AND ALL THE

69
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:12,257
REASONS HE OUTLINED, AND WITH

70
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,059
REGARD TO THE FACT THAT THE FIVE

71
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:15,928
FBI AGENTS HAVE NOW BEEN

72
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:16,628
REFERRED TO FOR INVESTIGATION

73
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,064
FOR BIAS AS A RESULT OF THIS,

74
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:21,667
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?

75
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:24,102
>> I HATE READING THE STROKE AND

76
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,605
PAGE EXCHANGE, THAT IS NOT HOW

77
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,574
FBI AGENTS SHOULD CONDUCT

78
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:30,843
THEMSELVES AND I THINK THAT THEY

79
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:32,544
SHOULD BE REFERRED FOR AN

80
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:34,480
INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, AS IT

81
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,280
RELATES TO THEIR JOBS.

82
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,250
BUT THERE WAS A FINDING THAT IT

83
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,318
DID NOT AFFECT ANY INVESTIGATION

84
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:41,186
ACTIONS THAT THEY TOOK, NOR

85
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:41,887
SHOULD IT.

86
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:43,589
I HAVE BROTHERS WHO ARE POLICE

87
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:46,258
OFFICERS AND THEY HAVE STRONG

88
00:02:46,258 --> 00:02:48,427
POLITICAL OPINIONS.

89
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:49,161
I HOPE THAT IT NEVER AFFECTS

90
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:51,697
WHAT THEY DO ON THE STREETS, AND

91
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:57,102
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY

92
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:58,303
CASE WAS AFFECTED.

93
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,305
>> Martha: GOING BACK TO WHAT

94
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,740
I MENTIONED BEFORE, JAMES COMEY

95
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,509
USURPED THE AUTHORITY OF THE

96
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:05,644
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND DID NOT

97
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,312
ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THEIR LEGAL

98
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:07,946
POSITION OF THE DEPARTMENT

99
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:08,347
PROSECUTORS.

100
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:09,915
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE LANGUAGE

101
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:11,683
THAT WAS CHANGED, AND IT'S

102
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:13,318
BELIEVED THAT IT WAS LIKELY

103
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,286
CHANGED BY PETER STRZOK.

104
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:16,622
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS THAT

105
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:17,723
WERE ALTERED, CHANGING

106
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:19,491
REASONABLY LIKELY, THE HOSTILE

107
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,026
ACTORS GAINED ACCESS TO THE

108
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,628
EMAIL SERVER, THAT WAS CHANGED

109
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:23,529
TO POSSIBLE.

110
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:25,163
THEY ALSO CHANGE THAT SHE USE

111
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,732
PRIVATE EMAIL TO COMMUNICATE

112
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:28,934
WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HOSTILE

113
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:30,469
TERRITORY TO, A SENIOR OFFICIAL.

114
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:31,603
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

115
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:34,773
SOFTENING OF THAT LANGUAGE AS IT

116
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:38,477
GOES THROUGH, AND YOU LOOK AT

117
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:39,845
THE TEXT MESSAGE THAT SAYS, WE

118
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,480
WILL FIND A WAY TO STOP IT WHEN

119
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,882
IT COMES TO THE TRUMP

120
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:45,083
PRESIDENCY, IT DOESN'T LOOK

121
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:45,384
GOOD.

122
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:46,885
>> IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK

123
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:47,185
GOOD.

124
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:51,723
BUT MARTHA, IF THEY WERE OUT TO

125
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:52,925
HURT DONALD TRUMP, WHY WAS THERE

126
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:54,793
NEVER A LEAK ABOUT THE RUSSIAN

127
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:55,460
INVESTIGATION WITH A SERIOUS

128
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,263
TALK CONTACT THAT HIS TEAM HAD?

129
00:03:58,263 --> 00:04:01,099
IF THEY WANTED TO DESTROY

130
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:02,067
DONALD TRUMP, THEY WOULD NOT

131
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:02,601
HAVE REOPENED THAT.

132
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,069
>> Martha: IT SEEMS LIKE THEY

133
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,505
WANTED TO KEEP THAT UNDER WRAPS.

134
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:08,307
ONE MORE THING, THIS IS A

135
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:09,174
STATEMENT FROM PETER STRZOK

136
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:10,208
THROUGH HIS ATTORNEY, AND IT

137
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,911
ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT THE

138
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,112
HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION,

139
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:15,347
AND I KNOW DEMOCRATS CRITICIZED

140
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:18,183
THE FACT THAT HERS WAS SO

141
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:20,319
PUBLIC, AND THE TRUMP

142
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,053
ADMINISTRATION WAS UNDER WRAPS.

143
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,055
THERE'S SIMPLY NO EQUIVALENT

144
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,324
FROM AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE

145
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:26,992
POSSIBLE MISHANDLING OF

146
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:28,260
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

147
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,261
INCREDIBLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTING

148
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,629
THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

149
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,898
OF A MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATE WAS

150
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:33,532
ACTIVELY COLLUDING WITH A

151
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:35,100
HOSTILE FOREIGN POWER IN A WAY

152
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,668
THAT COULD UNDERMINE THE

153
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:40,105
INTEGRITY OF AN AMERICAN

154
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:40,772
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, HE'S

155
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:47,045
FIGHTING THAT OFF AS IT'S FACT.

156
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:49,081
AND HE HAD TO MOVE HIS ATTENTION

157
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:53,285
SO FOR FIRMLY OVER TO THIS

158
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:54,386
CAMPAIGN, HE SO CLEARLY WANTED

159
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:54,853
TO SUCCEED.

160
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:57,322
>> THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

161
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:58,590
WHAT PETER STRZOK WAS SAYING,

162
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,692
BUT THERE IS NOT A CONCLUSION.

163
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:01,727
EVIDENCE HAS TO BE WEIGHED AND

164
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:04,296
TESTED AND THAT WILL BEAR OUT

165
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:05,163
THROUGH ANY FUTURE CHARGES THAT

166
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:06,999
ARE IN ADDITION TO THE 20 PEOPLE

167
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,166
THAT WERE ALREADY CHARGED AND

168
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,702
THE GUILTY PLEA THAT WE HAVE

169
00:05:10,702 --> 00:00:00,000
SEEN IN THE INVESTIGATION.
