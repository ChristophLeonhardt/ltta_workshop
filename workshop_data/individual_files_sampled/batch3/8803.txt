Shannon: DOUG McKELWAY LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THANK YOU. BIG GAMBIT FOR DEMOCRATS CARRYING ON THE FIGHT AND EVEN DISCUSSING IMPEACHMENT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH. WE SEEK TRUTH TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT, YES. THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE'LL BE MAKING A PRIORITY OF IMPEACHMENT. DEMOCRATS ARE SHOOTING THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT. WE OUGHT TO BE MOVING FORWARD. LET'S CHARGE JUSTICE KAVANAUGH ON HIS PERFORMANCE AS A JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT. Shannon: LET'S BRING IN GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR JONATHAN TURLEY. GOOD TO SEE YOU. WHAT YOU MAKE OF THIS DISCUSSIO DISCUSSION? BAD OR GOOD TO DISCUSS IMPEACHMENT? IT'S TERRIBLE ADVICE. THERE HAS TO BE SOME FINALITY IN THE SYSTEM. THERE SHOULD BE RESPECT FOR THE INSTITUTION. IF THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO CREATE THIS MONSTER, THEN THEY HAVE TO WONDER HOW THEY'RE GOING TO CONTROL IT. THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS ELENA KAGAN WAS NOT ENTIRELY TRUTHFUL IN HER TESTIMONY, BUT PEOPLE DIDN'T CALL FOR INVESTIGATION AND HER IMPEACHMENT. AT SOME POINT, YOU'RE DOING SERIOUS HARM TO THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF OUR SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. IF EVERY CONFIRMATION CAN BE REDONE WHEN A MAJORITY SHIFTS, THEN WERE GOING TO LOSE THE STABILITY THAT THE COURT HAS HAD. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH TERRIBLE THINGS IN THIS COUNTRY, THINGS THAT WOULD BREAK A LOT OF CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS INTO SMALL PIECES. WE HAVE SURVIVED IN PART BECAUSE OF THAT STABILITY AND NOT IN SMALL PART BECAUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT. Shannon: SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF SPLIT, EVEN WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BECAUSE EITHER TOP LEADERS LIKE FORMER SPEAKER AND HOPING TO BE SPEAKER AGAIN NANCY PELOSI SAY THINGS LIKE THIS NOT A PRIORITY. IT'S NOT A TOP THING. CONGRESSMAN NADLER, WHO WOULD BE THE TOP MEMBER NOW, THE CHAIR OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IF THEY TOOK BACK THE HOUSE THAT "IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE ARE EAGER TO DO BUT THE SENATE HAVING FAILED TO DO ITS CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED JOB, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO PROVIDE A CHECK AND BALANCE TO PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW AND PROTECT THE LEGITIMACY OF 1 OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS." YOU TOUCHED ON THIS. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK IF YOU CAN SOMEHOW PUT THIS ASTERISK OR TAINT ON JUST KAVANAUGH, IT RENDERS WHAT FLOWS FROM THE COURT POSSIBLY LEGITIMATE AS WELL. WHAT I AM MOST DISAPPOINTED IN IS THAT IT WAS NOT LONG AGO WHEN THERE WERE REAL INSTITUTIONALISTS, PEOPLE OF INTEGRITY IN CONGRESS, ON BOTH PARTIES WHO WOULD HAVE DENOUNCED THIS IMMEDIATELY. I WAS SHOCKED THAT LEADING DEMOCRATS DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY SAY NO, THIS IS WRONG. THIS IS THE BRIDGE WE WON'T CROSS. BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A NEW DEVELOPMENT WHERE WE HAVE GIVEN LICENSE FOR PEOPLE TO BE ENRAGED, TO FEEL THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO BE FAIR OR EMPATHETIC. PEOPLE HAVE TO WONDER, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE THE SAYING ABOUT SATURN, THAT REVOLUTIONS LIKE SATURN DEVOUR THEIR YOUNG. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL, IF THEY UNLEASH THIS, THEY MIGHT FIND THAT IT COMES BACK TO HOT THEM IN THE YEARS TO COME. Shannon: I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT NOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH SAID TONIGHT, KNOWING THAT HE'S GOING TO BE OPEN TO THIS CRITICISM ABOUT BEING TOO PARTISAN OR POLITICAL. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. MY GOAL IS TO BE A GREAT JUSTICE FOR ALL AMERICANS AND FOR ALL OF AMERICA. I WILL WORK VERY HARD TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. I WAS NOT APPOINTED TO SERVE ONE PARTY OR ONE INTEREST. BUT TO SERVE ONE NATION. Shannon: I NOTICED HE SAID I'M GOING TO BE A MEMBER OF THE TEAM. I WILL BE A TEAM PLAYER. ALL OTHER EIGHT JUSTICES WERE THERE TONIGHT. YEAH, AND THIS IS A VERY CLOSE KNIT GROUP. THEY HAVE TO BE. THERE'S ONLY NINE OF THEM. HE'S GOING TO CAST ONE OF THOSE MODES. WITH HIS WIKIPEDIA PAGE BEGIN WITH THIS CONTROVERSY? YOU BET BUT IT WON'T END THERE. HE'S GOING TO HAVE YEARS OF CASES, DECADES, THAT'S CALLED A LEGACY. IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IN THE END. HE KNOWS THAT. HE WILL BE LARGELY REMEMBERED BY THE CASES HE WRITES, AND HE HAS DECADES TO DO IT. Shannon: POSSIBLY OVERTURNING THE CHEVRON DEFERENCE. THIS CHECK ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY IN THEIR POWER. IT'S SIGNIFICANT. THIS DOCKET WAS MADE FOR KAVANAUGH. IT'S A COINCIDENCE BUT HE'S STARTING OUT IN ALL THE AREAS WHERE HE IS LIKELY TO REALLY TAKE THE COURT IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM JUSTICE KENNEDY. CRIMINAL CASES, ENVIRONMENTAL CASES, EXECUTIVE POWER CASES.
