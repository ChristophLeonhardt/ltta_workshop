and this is not about companies complying with the law they have to the Charter is actually a law that only applies to the government I say again this is about bending the knee and telling Justin Trudeau you're with him on political and moral issues last question by capital OHS I thought it was a good one take a look I just want to be clear here are you ruling out adding the attestation box to other government employment programs I would say that you know when we're delivering funding for programs through the Canadian government we we need to be reflective of the rights that Canadians have and the right for Canadians to you know to experience you know whether it's employment experiences in a non-discriminatory way I'm sorry that's a bigot right there by the way of course this will be expanded of course it will be and of course the Liberals think you're politically guilty until you publicly swear to the government that you're not isn't that creepy you know it is a charter right to be a dissident by the way you can disagree with anything and everything the government does you can disrespect the government's views they use the word respect you can disrespect the government you can think Justin Trudeau is a fool and a knave you can think he is immoral you can disagree with anything political you can disagree with Trudeau's morality especially on deeply personal or religious matters like sex you have to follow the law even if you're trying to change the law you have to follow the law until it's changed but you don't have to positively state things that renounce your point of view that's what Trudeau is doing here if you're having trouble with this concept imagine if Stephen Harper required every Canadian to pledge their support for say his view of criminal justice reform getting away yet you know his three-strikes-you're-out criminal justice reform let me give you an easier one imagine if Donald Trump demanded that every American pledged their support for the Second Amendment in the US that's the right to bear arms that's a that's a better example since it's a constitutional right down there it's unthinkable but you would compel millions of citizens to stand up and positively say an opinion just for them to have the rights of a citizens this is thinkable that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Azrael Avance show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
