Scientists from the
Guy Harvey Research Institute
and Save Our Seas Shark Research Center
are tagging sharks off the coast of
Fort Lauderdale as seen below.
The researchers are working alongside
a group of students as part of
efforts to raise awareness
about the critical
role that sharks play
in maintaining healthy oceans.
To catch sharks the group baits
drum lines with fish heads.
Once caught they're secured
to the back of the boat,
tagged and measured.
Students swab the gills,
fins and teeth for bacteria
and take genetic samples that can
be studied later in the lab.
One of the key research goals
for the project is to decode
the DNA of sharks in order
to better understand
how the animals have evolved over 
400 million years.
