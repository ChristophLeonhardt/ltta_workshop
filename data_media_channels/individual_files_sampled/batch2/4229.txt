so can i I'm just seeing this come across I guess it's not a wire anymore it's our phones but a federal grand jury has returned a new superseding indictment in the Manafort case the indictment says that manna fort secretly retained a group of former senior European politicians to take positions favorable to Ukraine including by lobbying in the United States it says in 2012 and 2013 manna fort used at least four offshore accounts to wire more than 2 million euros to pay the group of former politicians well I mean this is like a bad Tom Clancy book what is what was happening inside the Trump campaign what are we learning from this it's stunning Nicole and our colleagues are still going through this but it's remarkable that they chose today to file this and I think it really underscores the extent to which the Moller team is trying to put pressure overwhelming pressure on Paul Manafort to get him to plead guilty they're just trying to make him realize that he has no way out you know today we've learned that Rick Gates his former partner in right-hand man is going to testify against them essentially admitted to all this conduct with Paul Manafort and now these latest charges and this looks really bad right I mean wiring millions of dollars to politicians goes beyond lobbying clearly goes beyond even bank and tax fraud looking like bribery we're not sure exactly how they worded these criminal charges but Paul man forts world is crashing in on him and he's 68 years old and facing essentially a life prison term
