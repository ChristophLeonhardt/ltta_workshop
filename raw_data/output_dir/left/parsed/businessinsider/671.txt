I think one of those was balding you
just got to own it if you're realizing
you're losing your hair the safest bet
is just go clean shaven buzz cut is the
best way to go anything you try to do to
hide that you're losing your hair people
will obviously notice that you're trying
to cover that you're losing your hair so
I say just own it is the best thing to
do save it it's a nice clean look it's
super masculine a lot of really tough
guys have bald heads go for that
