00:00:00,225 --> 00:00:00,826
>> Shannon: AND A LEG,

2
00:00:00,826 --> 00:00:02,494
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,532
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, HE ARGUES

4
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:08,934
DEMOCRATS ARE NOW WHAT HE CALLS

5
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:10,569
A PERJURY TRAP FOR JUDGE

6
00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:10,936
KAVANAUGH.

7
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:13,939
AN OP-ED ENTITLED?

8
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:15,174
IS THE MOOD BOURQUE,

9
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:17,009
HE ARGUES THAT CABINET SHOULD BE

10
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:18,377
DENIED CONFIRMATION OR IF

11
00:00:18,377 --> 00:00:20,045
CONFIRM SHOULD ACTUALLY IMPEACH

12
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:21,747
BY LATER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS ON

13
00:00:21,747 --> 00:00:24,049
THE BASIS OF LYING ABOUT

14
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:25,150
DRINKING OR TERMS.

15
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,786
LET'S BRING A MAN, JONATHAN

16
00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:28,387
TURLEY.

17
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:29,588
PROFESSOR, GREAT TO HAVE YOU

18
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:30,189
WITH US.

19
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:31,357
HOW WORRIED ARE YOU THAT THIS IS

20
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:32,958
THE PATH THAT WE ARE GOING DOWN?

21
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,827
AND ON YOUR PC IS SAID THAT THIS

22
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:35,628
ISN'T JUST ABOUT GETTING TO HIM

23
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:37,830
WHAT KIND OF JUDGE SHE WOULD BE,

24
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,564
THIS IS ABOUT PUTTING UP

25
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,198
STATEMENTS AND POTENTIALLY

26
00:00:39,198 --> 00:00:40,766
PUTTING HIM IN A PLACE WHERE HE

27
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:42,935
WOULD HAVE DISCREPANCIES OR LIES

28
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:44,970
ABOUT THINGS FROM HIS PAST.

29
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,139
>> IT WAS AN OTHERWORLDLY

30
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:48,340
FEELING ABOUT THESE HEARINGS.

31
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,409
WHEN YOU'VE A U.S. SENATOR GOING

32
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:52,144
LITERALLY THROUGH A YEARBOOK AND

33
00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:53,345
SAYING, WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN

34
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,182
YOU TOLD YOUR FRIENDS THIS OR

35
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:56,715
THAT?

36
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:57,550
THAT REALLY DID HAVE A FEELING

37
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,953
OF A PERJURY TRAP.

38
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:01,721
WHAT IS FASCINATING ABOUT THE

39
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:02,388
DEMOCRATIC QUESTIONS IS THAT

40
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:04,522
THEY DIDN'T REALLY PRESS THAT

41
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,325
MUCH ON THE ACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

42
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:07,093
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

43
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:10,029
THEY KEPT ON TRYING TO GET HIM

44
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,030
TO DEFINE TERMS THAT WOULD

45
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,300
OBVIOUSLY BE QUITE EMBARRASSING.

46
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,601
THE IDEA BEING THAT HE COULD

47
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,303
EITHER REFUSE AND SAY THAT IS

48
00:01:17,303 --> 00:01:19,538
JUST NOT A VERY DIGNIFIED

49
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,339
QUESTION, WHICH FRANKLY I THINK

50
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:21,240
HE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE

51
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,409
CONSIDERED DOING.

52
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:24,510
OR HE MIGHT ALLY AND WHICH POINT

53
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,946
YOU CAN SAY THAT ALL OF THIS

54
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:27,713
DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE BECAUSE

55
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,315
HE HAS LIED UNDER OATH.

56
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:31,484
AT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE THE NEW

57
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:34,253
STANDARD, ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE

58
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:34,954
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR US.

59
00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:35,688
>> Shannon: AND HOMELY PEOPLE

60
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:36,722
ARE GOING TO WANT TO PUT

61
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:39,525
THEMSELVES THROUGH THAT.

62
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:41,527
HE SAYS, I CABIN SPENT COVERING

63
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:42,728
POLITICS FOR THAT LONG BUT LONG

64
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:43,596
ENOUGH, 11 YEARS BUT I THINK

65
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:46,165
ENTITLED TO PLAY THIS CARD.

66
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:46,899
THE POSITION THAT BRETT

67
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,134
KAVANAUGH WAS BEING HONEST ABOUT

68
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:50,503
HIS DRINKING IS THE WORST TO DIE

69
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:51,905
UPON THAT I'VE EVER SEEN

70
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:52,639
OTHERWISE, SMART PEOPLE TRY TO

71
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:55,408
DIE UPON.

72
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:55,742
[LAUGHS]

73
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:58,111
WE PEOPLE FROM THE BEGINNING

74
00:01:58,111 --> 00:01:59,546
SAY, BEFORE YOU HAVE A NEGATIVE

75
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:00,914
AND WE WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

76
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:01,948
TO STOP THIS PERSON.

77
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:05,118
WHETHER IT IS ABOUT TEMPERAMENT,

78
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:05,785
DRINKING, WHAT HE WENT ON A

79
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:09,021
CALENDAR IS ANYTHING TOO SMALL

80
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:09,455
TO GO AFTER?

81
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:10,323
>> NO.

82
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:12,592
WHAT IS BEING ARGUED HERE IS

83
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:13,726
THAT COME WITH HER HE LIED IN

84
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:15,995
ANY SUBJECT.

85
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:16,930
THE SCOPE OF

86
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:18,164
THE SUBJECT MATTER HAS NOW

87
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:20,300
EXPANDED TO THE POINT WHERE IT

88
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,800
DEFIES DEFINITION.

89
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,736
ANYTHING CAN BE ASKED.

90
00:02:23,736 --> 00:02:25,305
AND THINK AND BE ASKED OF A

91
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:25,638
NOMINEE.

92
00:02:25,638 --> 00:02:28,241
ANY ANSWER THAT IS NOT OPENLY

93
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:31,110
AND FRANKLY EMBARRASSING AND

94
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,313
DISCLOSING OF YOUR PAST COULD BE

95
00:02:33,313 --> 00:02:34,314
VIEWED AS PERJURY.

96
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:36,516
THE QUESTION IS, IS THIS WHAT WE

97
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:37,317
WANT FROM THE CONFIRMATION

98
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:38,885
HEARING AND IF IT IS, WHAT KIND

99
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:41,754
OF PEOPLE TO BE EXPECT TO GET?

100
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:43,323
IF EVERYTHING IN YOUR PAST CAN

101
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:46,192
BE BROUGHT UP AND YOU CAN GET

102
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:49,229
CONFRONTED AND DEMANDED THAT YOU

103
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,330
ANSWERED.

104
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,465
MY GREATEST CONCERN ABOUT ALL OF

105
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:55,335
THIS IS THAT WE ARE SO FAR

106
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:56,402
REMOVED FROM THE ORIGINAL

107
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:56,903
OBLIGATIONS.

108
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:59,038
ORIGINALLY THEY WERE ASKING

109
00:02:59,038 --> 00:03:00,940
ABOUT DRINKING AND THESE TERMS

110
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,909
BECAUSE THERE WAS A REFERENCE TO

111
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:04,010
HIS BEING A BLACKOUT DRUNK.

112
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,944
AND IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THAT

113
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:07,981
WAS SORT OF AN ARTIFICIAL

114
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:08,915
EXCUSE.

115
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:10,817
THERE WERE ASKING AND DETAILS

116
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:12,752
FOR HIM TO BECOME A HOLY DRINK

117
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:13,853
WITH, HOW HE DRANK AND WHETHER

118
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:15,722
HE WAS BELLIGERENT.

119
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:17,090
THEN YOU REALIZE THAT THIS IS

120
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,057
REALLY A PERJURY TRAP.

121
00:03:18,057 --> 00:03:19,692
>> Shannon: AT ABOUT THE ISSUE

122
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:20,159
OF IMPEACHMENT?

123
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,462
I WANT TO PLAY WHAT A DEMOCRAT

124
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:24,130
COME IF THEY RETAKE THE HOUSE AS

125
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,031
MANY PEOPLE THINK THEY WELCOME

126
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,299
HE WOULD ACTUALLY BE HEADING UP

127
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:27,167
THE HOUSE COMMITTEE AND HE HAS

128
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:30,036
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE I WORD,

129
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:30,537
IMPEACHMENT.

130
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:32,172
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.

131
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:35,308
>> IF HE IS ON THE SUPREME COURT

132
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:36,843
AND THE SENATE HASN'T

133
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:37,610
INVESTIGATED, THEN THE HOUSE

134
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,044
WILL HAVE TO.

135
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:41,648
WE WOULD HAVE TO INVESTIGATE,

136
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:42,582
ANY ALLEGATION OF PERJURY OR

137
00:03:42,582 --> 00:03:43,950
THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPERLY

138
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,186
LOOKED INTO BEFORE.

139

>> Shannon: UNIVERSITY OF

140
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:49,456
ALABAMA LAW SCHOOL PROFESSOR AND

141
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:52,192
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" HAD A PIECE

142
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,226
SAID THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER

143
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:54,194
SHOULD PLEDGED OUT THAT IF THEY

144
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:55,996
WIN A MAJORITY, THEY WILL

145
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:57,764
CONDUCT AN IMPEACHMENT

146
00:03:57,764 --> 00:03:58,732
INVESTIGATION.

147
00:03:58,732 --> 00:04:00,334
WE KNOW ONLY ONE SUPREME COURT

148
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:01,234
JUSTICE WHO WAS IMPEACHED BY THE

149
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:02,936
SENATE AND KATE COME OUT.

150
00:04:02,936 --> 00:04:03,904
WHAT ARE THE ODDS THEY GOT ON

151
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:04,505
THIS PATH?

152
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:09,443
>> YOU CAN'T COUNT ANYTHING OUT.

153
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:10,944
I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR

154
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:11,612
THESE MEMBERS TAKE SUCH A

155
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:14,314
RECKLESS TASK.

156
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:16,183
I WAS THE LEAD COUNSEL IN THE

157
00:04:16,183 --> 00:04:18,519
LAST JUDICIAL COMMITTEE.

158
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,952
IT IS A TERRIBLE PROCESS.

159
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:21,154
IT IS A LONG ONE.

160
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:22,456
I HAVE NO QUESTION IN MY MIND

161
00:04:22,456 --> 00:04:25,559
THAT THEY WOULD NOT SUCCEED.

162
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:27,094
THE PRESIDENT THAT THEY WOULD

163
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:29,596
LAY WITH THIS TYPE OF MOVE WOULD

164
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:31,698
BE INHERENTLY DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR

165
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:33,333
SYSTEM.

166
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,335
THEY CREATED A TYPE OF

167
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:36,303
PROTECTIVE PERSONA FOR OUR

168
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:36,737
JUSTICES.

169
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:38,105
THAT IS WHY THEY MADE

170
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:39,573
IMPEACHMENT SO DIFFICULT, YOU

171
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:41,542
CAN REDUCE THE SALARIES.

172
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,177
IF YOU ARE IMPEACHED AS

173
00:04:43,177 --> 00:04:43,944
SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE DONE WELL

174
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:47,515
IN OFFICE, IF HE IS CONFIRMED

175
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:49,517
THAT MEANS THE MAJORITY OF

176
00:04:49,517 --> 00:04:50,284
SENATORS FOUND THAT THEY WERE

177
00:04:50,284 --> 00:04:52,887
SATISFIED WITH THIS RECORD.

178
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:54,255
YOU MAY DISAGREE WITH THAT, BUT

179
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:56,323
TO SAY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO

180
00:04:56,323 --> 00:04:58,759
A DO OVER WOULD OPEN UP ANY

181
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,095
JUSTICE TO THAT TYPE OF

182
00:05:01,095 --> 00:05:01,462

WHETHER OR NOT THAT HAS A

191
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,577

192
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,112
