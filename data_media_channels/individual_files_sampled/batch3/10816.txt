we're all here because we've had to dismiss the manager of the national team they have provided no information to the Royal Spanish football federation we learnt it only five minutes before the press conference this has to be a message to all employees of the Royal Spanish football federation that this is no way to act this is a complicated story I want to help people understand let's do it colonel logically so first of all yesterday we had Yulin lipet agree who is the spanish coach essentially signed by Real Madrid great for him what did you think of that announcement no I think it was a strange announcement because you know what he stands for is tiki-taka football which is not the Real Madrid brand of of of playing we've just seen them win three consecutive Champions League in their own way with individual players basically making it up on the spot which is a great quality to have and then they pick him as a manager and and everyone thinking eh that's a little bit but it's it's a way that he was announced that has kind of sort of annoyed the Spanish FA and the new president Luis who will be Alice I think his name is he's already been the president for the Spanish FA since made the seventeenth and he's won the election on the back of him promising to making the Spanish FA stronger and not having to to always listen to what Real Madrid and Barcelona they want to do before they can make decisions and this is I think it's it's a power play and he's shown his hand he's shown exactly what he's going to do but to do this he sacked such a successful manager after one month what do you think of his argument now you know Ruby Allah says that basically he was bypassed that madrid should have come to him should have come to the Spanish FA and said look we're going to speak to your manager they never did this is that is that an explanation or an excuse and he's being petty well maybe maybe he should have you know involved that the FA but that's one thing but at the end of the day we have a manager here who has worked with the FA for many many years since 2011 he's made that understand 19th and under-21s European champions he's been in charge of Spain and the senior side in 20 games his 14 and he's drawn six or not lost the game with him and then all the time he's ever worked with the FA he's only ever lost one game so here we have someone who's clearly on the right track of creating a football team that goes in by the way to this tournament as number two favorites after Brazil you know I see this this is it's so messy and this is gonna go on for every time there's the press conference this is going to be talked about not the football yeah and the players I don't think you're very happy there were reports in the Spanish press that actually some of the senior players had gone to the ethane and tried to get them to overturn that but you know near these are hugely successful players and obviously their captain you know he has won the World Cup before he knows exactly what feeling that is just listen to what he's saying about that Darcie champion del mundo I poke a sensation in no time aqui para Lisa a lo que uno puede sentir siendo el campeon del mundo poor technical sto yo creo que me quedo con ese momento en el momento de Juan doe coach a la copa de la levanta y que el momento que también me da Mucha atención L receive amento en madrenas a general tovo C way guarantee I told Mary you know they wonder of a pilot if it's true it's a risky move by Ramos to go and complain because the particular is going to be his new post but how does this affect Spain's chances they got Fernando Hierro is going to take over a lot of people would know him as a player but not so much as a as a coach well he's been director of football for Spain this is his second stint he was then he left for six years and came back in November and he's a safe pair of hands there's no doubt about that he's one of Spain's biggest football stars ever one of the most successful ones but he's a different character you know and they now have a different voice in the dressing room which always makes it tricky and and we know how hungry these Spanish players they are for success there are eight players from Real Madrid as I said before they are so used to winning they play this is for me you know perhaps the most crazy thing they play that biggest rivals on day two of the World Cup they played Portugal and and someone else is going to line that team up maybe he disagreed with one or two positions I mean this is going to be completely different Spain and very difficult for them yeah you
