BRIAN: JUNE 12TH, ARE YOU
GOING TO BE IN SINGAPORE.
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
RIGHT NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT
IT.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.
THEY ARE TALKING TO US.
WE HAVE CERTAIN CONDITIONS.
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
BUT, THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE.
IT WOULD BE A GREAT THING
FOR NORTH KOREA.
IF THAT HAPPENS, IT WILL BE
A GREAT THING FOR NORTH
KOREA.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT WOULD
BE A GREAT THING FOR THE
WORLD.
SO WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
BRIAN: RIGHT.
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THE
PHASE-IN OF A
DENUCLEARIZATION IF THE
CONFIDENCE MEASURES ARE
REQUIRED?
>> WE'RE GOING TO SEE.
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
INTEREST DONE IMMEDIATELY.
PHYSICALLY A PHASE-IN MAY BE
A LITTLE BIT NECESSARY.
WOULD HAVE TO BE A RAPID
PHASE IN.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT BE
DONE AT ONE TIME.
STEVE: AS THAT SOUND BITE
WAS RUNNING.
NEWT GINGRICH SAYS I THINK
HE IS PLAYING IT EXACTLY
RIGHT.
FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE,
RAN FOR PRESIDENT.
GOT A BOOK OUT.
COMING JUNE 5TH THAT'S
CALLED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
AMERICA.
MR. SPEAKER, GOOD MORNING.
>> HE IS PLAYING IT RIGHT.
STEVE: WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE
IS PLAYING IT RIGHT.
>> WOULD LIKE TO DO IT.
IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.
WE WILL KEEP THE SANCTIONS
ON.
THE PROBLEM IS KIM JONG UN
NOT HIM.
IS HE NOT PANTING HEAVILY
AND SAYING WE HAVE TO GET
THIS DONE.
WHAT CAN I COULD TO
WHAT CAN I DOULD TO
WHAT CAN I DO TD TO
WHAT CAN I DO TO TO
WHAT CAN I DO TO AO
WHAT CAN I DO TO APPEASE.
IF I SEND YOU A COUPLE
BILLION IN CASH WILL YOU
LIKE ME MORE?
TRUMP IS SAYING YOU WANT TO
COME AND MEET AND HAVE A
CHANCE FOR YOUR REGIME TO
SURVIVE GLAD TO TALK TO YOU.
DON'T WANT TO DO IT, FINE
WITH ME.
AINSLEY: HE WAS SAYING WANT
TO TALK GET RID OF YOUR
NUKES.
STEVE: ALL AT ONCE.
AINSLEY: HE SAYS WE ARE NOT
AGREEING TO THAT PRESIDENT
ART OF THE DEAL SIT DOWN
WITH THEM AND PHASES THEY
MIGHT WORK.
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO DO
THE PHASE IN SO THEY GET THE
MEETING OR IS IT MORE
IMPORTANT TO GET RID OF THE
NUKES AND DON'T HAVE THE
MEETING?
>> I THINK NORTH KOREANS
INSIST WE GIVE UP THE
DEMAND.
IT'S BETTER TO HAVE THE
MEETING.
AINSLEY: I AGREE.
>> FIRST OF ALL, NORTH KOREA
HAS ENOUGH WEAPONS, AIMED AT
SEOUL, BIGGEST CITY IN SOUTH
KOREA THAT THEY CAN KILL
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE THE FIRST DAY WITHOUT
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY
CAREFUL ABOUT A WAR.
LAST THE LAST THING YOU
WANT.
TRUMP HAS RATCHETED UP THE
PRESSURE, HE HAS MADE IT
VERY REAL.
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT
SECRETARY POMPEO'S SPEECH
ABOUT THE IRANIANS WAS ALSO
AIMED AT THE NORTH KOREANS.
IT WAS A VERY TOUGH SPEECH
AND SAID BASICALLY WE'RE
GOING TO TAKE APART YOUR
ECONOMY REMINDER TO THE
NORTH KOREANS YOU DON'T WANT
TO PLAY NICE, FINE WE ARE
GIGGER THAN YOU WE WILL NOT
PLACE MARIA NICE EITHER.
BRIAN: AFTER THAT MEETING IN
CHINA.
HE MENTIONED IT.
AND THEN VICE PRESIDENT
PENCE HARDLY A ROGUE COMES
OUT AND SAYS THAT LIBYA
MODEL IS ALWAYS AN OPTION
THEY CAME BACK AND CALLED
HIM A POLITICAL DUMMY
YESTERDAY.
THAT PERSON MAKING A
STATEMENT IS VERY TIGHT WITH
KIM JONG UN WITHIN HIS
ADMINISTRATION HERE IS THE
BALANCING PROBLEM THEY HAVE
GOT.
DICK SHARE THESHIP DEDICATED
ENTIRE LIFE TO ACHIEVING
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND
PROTECTING THEMSELVES.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SPENT
ENTIRE LIFE DOING.
THIS KIM JONG UN ONE OF THE
PEOPLE COMMENTED TO ME MAY
HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME GOING GOIG
TO SINGAPORE BECAUSE HE
MIGHT NOT BE ALLOWED BACK
IN.
BRIAN: THAT WAS THE CONCERN
OF THE SOUTH KOREAN
NEWSPAPER THERE MIGHT BE A COO
NEWSPAPER THERE MIGH MBE A COO
NEWSPAPER THERE MIGH MIG A COO
NEWSPAPER THERE MIGH MIGHT COO
NEWSPAPER THERE MIGH MIGHT BOO
NEWSPAPER THERE MIGH MIGHT BEO
NEWSPAPER THERE MIGH MIGHT BE A
COUPE IF HE LEAVES THE
COUNTRY.
>> REAGAN USED TO SAY TRUST
BUT VERIFY.
THE NEWS OF THIS GUY IS
DISTRUST AND REALLY VERIFY.
I THINK AS LONG AS HAVE YOU
POMPEO AND BOLTON AND TRUMP
ALL MOVING IN THE SAME
DIRECTION, AND I THINK IT IS
A GOODED IN TO -- I THINK I
WILL GO ROGUE THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN THAT WAS A
VERY DELIBERATE.
BOLTON'S COMMENT WAS
DELIBERATE AND ALSO A
REMINDER.
WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK IT OUT
SO YOU SURVIVE.
BUT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS
WHERE YOU DON'T SURVIVE.
STEVE: WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE.
>> I LIKE THAT.
THAT'S GOOD.
