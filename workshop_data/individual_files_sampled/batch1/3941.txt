well thank you for being here Cecile it's great to be here thanks so I'm wondering how do you define success I think success is really setting your goals and then whether there's big or small and just going for them and not giving up I think that so many things didn't I talk about this some in my book is just things that seem impossible at the time but if you just keep trying eventually you eventually you win and that's a that's I think where most success comes from why did you decide to name it make trouble well I think it's because I think trouble making is actually led to a lot of the progress we've made in this country you know I think about even 100 years ago before when planned parents started women couldn't even vote right we did have a right to anything and it really was because people made trouble and women went to jail and they challenged the laws and defied convention that women made progress and so I think it's as my friend Congressman John Lewis would say it's like about making good trouble and I think would you do and really stand up for things you believe that's how we make progress yeah and you've never been afraid to be polarizing like for example like feminist icon Gloria Steinem she's called you quote the best teacher on earth someone you trust then you have the National reviews editor rich Lowry saying a skilled defender of the indefensible have you dealt with such extreme perceptions of yourself well I think if you meet me that's not really what I'm like and unlike everyone else I mean I I I want to I don't want to intentionally cause trouble I really just want to make sure that we stand up for the values that we believe in and I've had that really good fortune I've been I've led a very privileged life you know I've gotten to choose the work I do and I hope every job I've had has been a little bit about trying to push the ball forward but eerily for folks who may not have the same opportunities that I've had sometimes that's women sometimes that's working people sometimes that's immigrants and as my mom said you know you can go a lot of places you can be I guess successful or make a lot of money but there's nothing quite like having a job where people actually say to you thanks for making like my life better and I've been real privileged to do that so is that what drives you hearing from those people well it really does I think getting a sense of like why are we on this earth and you know I've worked with a lot of people who didn't have any choice and what they did I worked with women who were nursing home workers women who worked in hotels janitors who basically clean buildings worked two jobs just to support their family and it really taught me a lot about how how much opportunity I had to do anything I wanted to with my life and so when you do have that chance I think it's it's on all of us to make a make the decisions about how we would have use our time on this earth and again I don't make any bones about it I've been very lucky because I've always had the opportunity to do what I really felt like was important and and again make make things a little bit better for some other folks yeah so it's like a really fundamental Drive like what do we even here for let's do something about it yeah you know it's funny when I started my first nonprofit this little dinky nonprofit in Texas and I had no idea what I was doing but it was a oh my god that was years ago although it's now been operating for decades so it was right after my mom lost her reelection and I just felt like wow someone need to do something about public education and standing up for some basic basic civil liberties I really didn't know what I was doing but I did it anyway and it was funny during the time older men would come and say hey could I you know what they'd had very successful careers in banking or industry and they come and say like I just come volunteer with you guys because I think they were at a point in our life where they thought wow what is it all about and so I've always try to kind of keep that in mind is it this is the only life you have so you got to make the most of it and did you have this like this kind of streak in you when you were a kid well my parents of course were complete troublemakers uh-huh my my dad we lived in Dallas Texas and it was pretty conservative and my parents were very liberal my dad was a civil rights lawyer and he was actually defending conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War my mother was she was a rabble-rouser I mean she was a housewife but she was fighting for the farmworkers and she was when the women's movement came to town she just was jumped you know headfirst and so I think as a as a kid I have you know siblings all of us just saw our parents and saw like politics was it wasn't drudgery or wasn't dirty it was actually where all the action was and so I was kind of logical that I chose this path yeah and even like as you were saying growing up in Dallas controversy wasn't a problem it was something they're comfortable with right well it's something you had to do I mean again that was a time in which like everything was segregated the schools were segregated the pools were segregated I mean people of color in Dallas had very few options and I know we've made progress not enough and women I mean none of the women that that and none of the moms I knew had the chance to work outside the home so there's just a lot of things where people had to really fight to say you know what we need more opportunity and of course my mom began to take her own path as you probably know and finally kind of left that life as a housewife which was rewarding but not enough for her and eventually ran for office herself yeah so your mom governor Ann Richards served as governor from 91 to 95 correct and when you got to see this transformation throughout your childhood of her her ascent through politics right what was that like even when you started to join her as a kid like with this activism well it was kind of amazing and I think one of the things I learned from it and perhaps it's applicable to some of the folks who might read the book or be watching this is that no one ever thought she could do it she said she what she thought she could do I mean there had never been a woman elected in her own right in Texas as governor and my mother was like completely the wrong profile I mean she was a liberal she was divorced she was a recovering alcoholic and we never had a poll showing that she could win and the fact is she just did it anyway because she thought it needed doing and and I think like a lot of women who run for office or maybe get into business they look at who's in the job and they think well I think I could do a better job and that really was what motivated her and of course we did win that election and what we're seeing today is of course women of winning elections that no one thinks they can win so I think it's a lesson for us to you know don't ever let your practicality sort of step on your idealism or what you really think you need to do and want to do because that's only way things happen and even before that when you were a teenager for example were you like joining her in her political activism well you know it really wasn't it's interesting I went away to college I kind of escaped Texas I'd never lived outside of the state and I went pretty much as far as you can go I went to Rhode Island and brown to brown and that was the first time my mother had run for anything she was running for county commissioner and so it was all very different and then of course you know whenever she ran for something else we'd all come home and help her out and so it was really very late you know in my life that she became this feminist icon before she kind of just been mom but I do I think it's another lesson that I hope that she showed and that women are seeing which is it's never too late to have a great life or to do what you were and yeah well you know what you're destined to do yeah when you were at Brown sophomore year yes you thought you were gonna you dropped out actually right I did dad yeah why'd you make that decision you know I got I guess I had never been away from I had never been away from home and there was a there was a labor strike actually the janitors and brown went on strike and I had never been involved in anything like that but I got very deeply involved because my own janitor who had been you know cleaning our dormitory was now out on the picket line and I was somewhat disillusioned I thought wow you know are these the values of my of my University I think I probably just need to get out and kind of get my head clear so I went to Washington and work for a non-profit and then I eventually came back to brown and made a lot of trouble but also got my degree but it was a really great education I think it was for me a lot of the education we get in life is not necessarily what's being taught in the classroom it's the experience as we get outside of that and that was absolutely true at Brown what was it like returning to Brown how is it different after you have this experience I think one is I just had the confidence to sort of question Authority and stand up for the things I believed in I got very involved in the divestment movement Brown was one of the first universities to divest from South Africa which was sort of the do explain yeah yes I know it's like seems like ancient history now but at the time I mean it's relevant because of what young people are doing on campus now but one of the international movements to support folks in South Africa that we're trying to overthrow the apartheid government or at least change and have a democracy was to get you universities to divest their holdings in South Africa and believe me at the time people said students were crazy that would never happen it was disruptive you know fill in the blank and we did it anyway and it was really a it was a great experience I learned so much I mean I learned a lot about Africa I learned a lot about organizing and of course eventually Brown did divest and then several universities divested and now as they write the story of what happened in South Africa I've learned as others have just how critical actually that movement that global movement was and years later in a court of interesting twist of fate they gave Nelson Mandela an honorary degree at Brown so that's another theme of the book which is that you know you lose you lose you lose and then you win and it's a big difference and I think if you're really fighting for something that you really believe in sometimes it's really hard and you don't always win but eventually you make progress and that's a that was a good example to me when do you think you first realized that that you have to not let things get you down that you have to take a long-term perspective will probably am another unsuccessful thing I did at Brown I was involved in the anti-nuclear movement to try to keep the Seabrook nuclear plant from being built and I think it's now been operating for decades so sometimes you just lose and you just have to keep going on but also I realized you know when I when I left Brown I became probably an unlikely path for a brown graduate I became a union organizer I work for garment workers in the southern United States and in Texas and along the rio grande border and i realize this is gonna be a long haul these are women who have been working at minimum wage for decades you know and to make a change in their life was going to take a long long time and probably it would help me it'd be I guess a tad more patient then I was in college realizing that this is long this is work that that you have to be committed to for your life and so I have been when you were offered the role at Planned Parenthood in 2006 it would have required moving from DC to New York right routing your family right so you called your mom for some advice what was that call like yeah well the the truth was and I think this is relevant for women who are trying to think about what to do next I I wasn't so much moving although I had to break it to my kids it was just that I didn't think I was skilled enough to take the job I mean I I had run smaller nonprofits but I had never raised that much money been responsible for a huge national organization with this you know almost 100-year history and so I was afraid of I'm sure I was afraid of failing and so I called my mom and she said you know get over yourself you know you never know unless you try and the things you really regret in life are the chances that you didn't take and so I went for the job interview and then lo and behold you know 12 years later I've been had the honor of being the president of Planned Parenthood and and really having a window into some of the most important work happening for women in the country and when you got this advice from your mom I'm sure that she was always a go-to person for advice right well and she had a lot of advice right yeah what do you think maybe is the single best piece of advice that she gave you in your life well I think and I know I mentioned earlier that for her she spent a lot of years just doing what society expected her she was to raise kids be a perfect wife for the perfect dinner party and she did that for several years and it wasn't until she had the chance to kind of break out and do what she wanted to do for her I think she was always regretful that she you know missed some time and didn't always you know that she lets social convention get in the way so her best advice was this is the only life you have so do it and whatever it is never turn down a new opportunity and you know she used to say when I was worried about taking a new job or other women who would say you know I'm not sure if I'm qualified she said look what's the worst thing that could happen and I think that's really good advice to just think about when you're thinking about starting a new business or changing jobs it's just what's the worst thing that could happen because usually once you can imagine that it's not that bad so what ultimately drew you to the Planned Parenthood job well of course I like a lot of women were like one in five women in the country I'd been a planned peer to patient when I was at Brown that's where I got my birth control and so I knew about the organization had been a supporter and to me it was one of the most important or in the country in terms of helping women live out their lives and have opportunity to finish school and start a career and supportive family so to me it was there was no question that if this is something I could do it would be such an honor and the job has been big and like you know challenging but I never even imagined how great it would be so I'm so glad that I did go for that interview and obviously glad they chose me and you were tasked with kind of making it more political right bringing it back to its activist roots I think well I think one of the challenges that Planned Parenthood had was we are an excellent health care provider and we provide health care to about two and a half million people every year but politics was getting in the way I mean more and more laws were being passed and restrictions and so I think it was not necessarily to be more political but just to really rebuild our movement roots but then there were other things that we figured out too like we needed to use technology more and invest in new ways of getting care to people which I'm proud to say we really have done invest in young people you know whole new generation of young people as patients because they they want different things and young people did when Planned Parenthood was started or even when I went to college at Brown so that has been part of the exciting thing is just thinking about healthcare delivery in a new way as well as bringing in another generation of activists and what was the biggest challenge that you faced as the head of it I mean I think the I think the biggest challenge is the disruption in the healthcare world and we specialize in serving folks that don't have a lot of options often sometimes they're uninsured they're younger they may be more mobile and it's the healthcare system you know hasn't always been an easy place to navigate and so one of the most exciting things I write about this in the book was the fight for the Affordable Care Act because it seemed like such a chance to finally get some equity for women in the healthcare system and I'm proud to say that we did we made a lot of progress and that has fundamentally changed life not only for women that come to Planned Parenthood but millions of others you know the most successful moment I think of my life was the the day that President mama called me and I talked about this and said you know he was about to announce that now all women that get insurance would get birth control covered at no cost that has been revolutionary for women and we're now at like a 30-year low for unintended pregnancy in this country and I'm really really proud of that yeah can you tell me a little bit more about what that fight was like yes no well I mean I think it was a good lesson in in that sometimes you have to fight with your friends not just people who are your opponents because getting this done was a big lift and we had within the Democratic Party within yeah within Congress within the White House because you know no one wants if something's really hard to get no one wants to give it up for free and we really did have to mobilize young people on college campuses dressed up in giant pill packs and you know you know agitated came to Congress wrote to the White House and so it did take a lot and you may even remember there was a moment in which Congress was holding a hearing about whether birth control should be covered they refused to let a Georgetown Law student testify because they said they needed experts and when we saw the panel of experts there was one thing they had in common is that is they've never used birth control because they were all men so that I mean we really had some pretty big obstacles but I think the exciting thing is now and of course unfortunately this administration is trying to unravel this birth control benefit but once you make once you win something that big it's much harder to take it away I mean women in this country are very aware of what that means for them to be able to have that economic freedom and access to care so are you worried about the future of Planned Parenthood in any of the accomplishments that you made with it well I mean you know nothing's ever finished so we always have more progress to make but one of the reasons I felt like I could leave after twelve years is the organization is as strong as it's ever been we have more than 11 million supporters we have we're delivering health care all across the country we're delivering health care in some states online you know birth control is getting better I feel really hopeful and most importantly we have a generation of young people who are their own advocates and that to me is you know you marry that with the excellent health care we provide I feel good about the future even I'm sure there'll be some they're gonna be battles battles ahead yeah and you explained in the book this meeting that you had with Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump right they invited you what was that about that was shortly after Trump's inauguration yeah actually was it was actually before the inauguration okay I think that's okay no but it was right around that time and I may have I may have that wrong but basically they wanted to meet about planned parent is going to be I mean Paul Ryan had already declared they're gonna defund Planned Parenthood and so even though I was frankly a little anxious about having that meeting because I didn't know what to expect I felt like you know I owed it to our patients to try but in the end I really believed what they you know what certainly what Jared Kushner expresses that he wanted us to quit providing abortion services to women in this country in exchange for keeping our public funding and I just said you know we really stand for the right of women to get the reproductive health care they need and that's a legal service that it's really important that women can get it and we're not going to trade that off for money so it didn't go that well but at the end of the day we were able to mount a campaign with hundreds of thousands of people around the country that supported Planned Parenthood able to keep our public funding and I hope we continue to do so because it makes it it makes a big difference a lot of women who come to us we're their only health care provider yeah so when you were having that conversation what was going through your head when this proposal was made I just said look I've got a I thought this is my chance to educate the two of them about who we see what we do and of course re-educate them if they needed to know that federal funding doesn't go for abortion services so in fact the money that they were talking about cutting off from Planned Parenthood provides access to breast cancer screenings and birth control and STI testing and treatment and again for a lot of the women and young people who come to us there's no one else in town to do that work so even though they understood that I felt like they were trying to make kind of a political deal and that's just not who we are to Planned Parenthood yeah was this an example of how you have always had to kind of balance it's politics with your personal ideals and then leading an organization well I you know it's interesting because I have been through and have been through congressional hearings I've done a lot of other things in this twelve years of planned parenthood I think the thing that's important to me is that we always keep women at the center of everything we do decisions we make in positions we take and so for me it isn't hard it's not a political game it's actually about women whose health and sometimes their lives are at stake and I think if we can continue to try to lift up their stories and create more empathy in this country for what women need which is basically access to affordable health care no matter where they live no matter their immigration status their geography their income then we'll have done the right thing so I just try to keep that in mind when did you decide that you're going to step down from Planned Parenthood well after we beat back this effort to defund Planned Parenthood I felt like and you know we sort of got and that was with the help of two in really important Republican senators in in which Sunday yes yes Susan Collins from Maine and Lisa Murkowski from Alaska yes I mean they are national national heroines to me in terms of really standing up for women in their caucus but once that happened you know I had really made a commitment to invest in a new generation of leaders and even though it's really hard to leave an organization that you love I think it's important to demonstrate sometimes that you can step aside and let someone else take the reins and so we'll have a really smooth transition a Planned Parenthood a lot of women are interested and I'm probably some men interested in this job and that's great and I will tell them I will be cheering on the sidelines every step of the way for what they do next did you remember the exact moment when you made that decision no it really wasn't an exact moment I had always been thinking that you know 10 years is a long time to do this job I stayed an extra - and I could have stayed longer but I really felt like it just felt right felt right for me and it felt right for the organization - I think it's I think it's the right time so what's next for you I don't know and that's kind of exciting - I've been a little bit of an entre nor in the past I've started nonprofits and I've been always involved in movements there's a lot of work that needs to be done in this country I think and one of the things I'm most focused on right now is making sure that every single person is registered to vote and that they vote this November I really think we need to restore democracy in the sense of having people not only have the right to vote but then exercising that right and I think if we do you know I think we can change the direction in some of the some of the areas that that I'm concerned about are you gonna run for office at some point well you know it's not really my plan but you never want to say never that's one thing my mother told me right is never turned down a new opportunity but I am excited about all the women running for office twice as many women running for Congress as two years ago up and down the ticket I mean there's all kinds of women running and so I'd love to do everything I can to help them support them and again just change the face of who's an office a bit who are some specific candidates that come to mind well it's interesting me they're two women that actually I mean they're they're races are already done they just won they'll be the first two Latinas ever to go to Congress from Texas that's huge if it's incredible that it took us that long but they're women I mean they're women all over Planned Parenthood employees that are running for office on an eskimo me a friend a young woman in Florida running for the State House nickimja Williams who just got elected to the state Senate in Georgia so it's exciting to me just to see women not waiting their turn not waiting asking for permission and as I say you know they're they're starting even before they're ready and it's about time yeah so throughout your career whether you were with unions or even with the Democratic Party or with Planned Parenthood you've gravitated towards jobs that have had like lots of intense opposition sometimes even violent threats do you seek out jobs that have that type of thing that you think I'm just like a magnet for weird controversy well yeah where you have to where you want to like there's a struggle involved well I guess I think that again going back to the theme is like this is the only life you have you really should stand up I believe if you can and if you have the privilege that I have and really stand up for the things that you believe in and fight hard for hard stuff I think if it's easy someone else has probably already done it and so it's not that I'm a glutton for controversy but I do think when it comes to LGBTQ rights when it comes to women's rights when it comes to you know the right of everyone to have equal pay and and then a fair chance those are hard fights and and I know we've learned you know people don't give up power without a fight I really would love to see if you know I think about all the time I've spent in Congress fighting for women's access to affordable health care and just access to be able to make their own decisions about their health care I feel like I'd love to be still alive to see the day when half of Congress could get pregnant and then I think we'd finally quit fighting about birth control and reproductive health care so I that may be inciting controversy but I think it really more is just hoping for a world that can be a little bit better than it is now yeah whereas like these are fights worth having it's not yeah yeah I mean I don't yeah definitely not like seeking trouble just for the the sake of it and again I think some of the most important things that we've been able to do at Planned Parenthood have been to just continue to push the envelope not sit back and rest on our laurels and say well it's good that birth control is legal it doesn't matter if it's legal if not everyone can get it and again I think we're making huge progress but you know we're at a record low for teenage pregnancy in the u.s. it's something I'm very proud of but I will also say it's not equal that you know rates of teenage pregnancy are still too high among young women who are with low incomes young women of color young women in the southern United States and so there's just work left to do yeah and that even gets again back to the the title of your book it's knowing when to shake things up in a good way how do you find what you should be standing for how should someone look internally for those well I think for me I I really try to channel the women that I work with you know right out College I think of the women who are you know working double shifts cleaning hotel rooms many of them single moms supporting a family or I think of the some of the immigrant janitors I worked with in Los Angeles who were making minimum wage and still sending money back home to support a family that they'd had to leave leave behind and I just think what can we do to make this world more equitable give everyone equal opportunity recognizing that I've had an enormous privilege in my life and it's time for me to pay it forward and that helps me I think figure out not only what I've done up to now but probably what's next yeah and we've talked a lot about some of the best advice that you've received what's the worst advice you've been given the worst advice I've been given uh actually it's kind of funny it's a small example but maybe helpful to some people I remember when I was in high school and I had read about this college in Providence I'd never been out of Texas I didn't know you know I couldn't could barely find it on a map but where the students had been really active on for students of color and getting getting more financial aid and I think they'd taken over the administration building I thought wow this sounds like my kind of place so I went to talk to the college counselor at my school and he looked at me and he said well you could never get in there he said I here are some safety schools these are places you should apply he was definitely trying to take me down a notch and so I totally ignored him and I applied anyway and I got in and not only did I get in I had a great education I met people that changed my life and 30 years later I got an honorary degree from brown so I feel like those things sometimes you just have to recognize when people are trying to dampen your expectations or dampen your idealism I think it's important to stand up for what you believe even if that means making trouble yeah what advice would you give to someone who wants to have a career like yours I think that if you're really young and just kind of getting started sometimes it's hard to get into big nonprofits or I think volunteering going seeing it finding a cause you care about I mean one of my first you know I for a had a job like this I remember I volunteered for someone running for City Council in Austin and like two days later I was in charge of the phone bank it was like you know they were they were just so excited to have volunteer and I learned a ton of skills that way so I think it is important sometimes you just you know get on a board of an organization that you care about throw a fundraiser for them these are kinds of things that help you then begin to know is this the organization you want to be with or either as a job or just as something you do in your volunteer time but there are so many opportunities now and I think there's never been frankly a better time to be a volunteer and to stand up for for something that you really really do care about yeah and when you've been part of all of these different organizations what would you say is the common thread among all of them I think it's to try to get people just a better shake and really I hope whether is economic opportunity whether it's you know women having equal chance it's you know we're doing better but we're still not doing you know near enough and one of the things I learned from this you know being at Planned Parenthood all these years is just literally a difference it can make the fork in the road that someone can be in and they whether they can't get a breast cancer screening or they did and therefore planned period was able to actually get them to treatment that saved their life or what it means for a young woman to be able to get affordable healthcare and get birth control that gets her through college that can mean the difference about what her opportunities are and so getting to be part of a movement like that is is unbelievably rewarding I realize it's a huge privilege and so I always feel like every day I need to pay it pay it back some way was there ever a moment in your life where you question this burden that you had what's never fully felt like a burden okay but I've never tried to take a straight job that's true you know just like and also again I I had the good fortune when I was young and I write about meeting Kirk my husband who was also an organizer so finding someone that actually has the same ideas and dreams and idealism that you do make a lot easier it was easier to have three kids and raise them with someone who understood that sometimes I needed to be you know off on a picket line or you know had to you know be traveling and doing this you know I think we both tried to balance that but it's meant building a life that really has had great meaning for us and now of course all three of our kids are I think they are all activists in their own right and that's that's the best reward for any parent it's like the family business well except it's not a business so much but yes but it's a family passion it's a family passion and look I'll say there's like there's been some great moments with my kids but nothing better than all five of us being at the inauguration of Barack Obama as president United States because all of them and had a had a role in that you know as even though the twins weren't even old enough to vote but they volunteered they door knocked and it felt like a huge accomplishment when you're looking at the entirety of your career so far what do you think would be a time maybe your biggest failure and what that's hot you and so there's been so many one was I went to work on Capitol Hill and actually was a great job it was this was I had moved to Washington and I can't remember the year but actually was when Nancy Pelosi first became the Democratic whip she was the highest-ranking woman ever in Congress and I'd never worked on Capitol Hill I had no idea how things worked there but I thought it was such an opportunity I learned so much from her I mean I spent about a year and a half on the hill and then left to start a new non-profit but it was one of these things where even though I was I think I always felt like I was a failure because like there were people there who knew everything about every rule and how Congress worked and all this so I don't feel like I was successful but I learned so much from Nancy Pelosi and from the people who had made there and had built their entire career working in government some of the most brilliant passionate people folks who could gone on and done anything and made a lot more money but they were committed to public service and there's still some of my very best friends so even though I realized it wasn't the job for me I wouldn't trade that experience for anything and I that's also one of the things to learn is that you know you can try something and even it's okay to say it didn't work out but you you almost get something from every single job or new adventure that you take even if it doesn't work out in the long run and and Nancy Pelosi is still a really good friend and frankly we work together on passing the Affordable Care Act and a lot of other things so those relationships have become some of the most important in my life and what did that experience teach you specifically going forward well one was that I wasn't cut out to work in government I was impatient and I really wanted to be out making things happen and right then it was really really difficult but I think it it it reminded me of a lesson that I feel like I've learned and had to relearn which is anytime you can take a job with someone who can teach you something go for it and I learned again I learned a lot from from her I learned a lot from the people on the hill and so just soaking that up it was like taking a graduate course in Capitol Hill and so I think that's I always I always advise young women in particular to always look for someone who can be a mentor to you or who can teach you about something you don't know about because you never know when that's gonna come in handy well thank you so much it's Neal hey thanks for having me buddy to be here thank you you
