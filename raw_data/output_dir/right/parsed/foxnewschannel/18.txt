THEY FEEL THEY CAN FIND OUT MORE
BY NOT BLOWING IT UP.
BRING IN SARAH SANDERS FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE, OBVIOUSLY PRESS
SECRETARY.
SARAH, YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ALL
THIS LAST NIGHT TO TODAY, FROM
THE PRESIDENT'S RALLY AND
BEYOND.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER CRITIC OF THE
PRESIDENT WAS TARGETED, ROBERT
DE NIRO, JOE BIDEN WHO MIGHT BE
RUNNING AGAINST THE PRESIDENT
AND CRITICAL OF HIM.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN MADE
AWARE OF THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS
THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE THIS
MORNING.
AS HE SAID YESTERDAY, AS HE
CONTINUED TO SAY FROM DAY ONE OF
TAKING OFFICE, THAT WE CONDEMN
VIOLENCE IN ALL FORMS.
THIS IS A DESPICABLE ACT AND
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD
NEVER TAKE PLACE IN AMERICA.
STEVE: ABSOLUTELY.
ONE HOUR AGO THE PRESIDENT TREAT
TWEETED THIS OUT, A VERY BIG
PART OF ANGER WE SEE IN OUR
SOCIETY IS CAUSED BY THE
PURPOSEFULLY FALSE AND
INACCURATE REPORTING THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA I REFER TO AS
FAKE NEWS.
IT HAS GOTTEN SO BAD AND HATEFUL
IT IS BEYOND DESCRIPTION.
MAINSTREAM MEDIA MUST CLEAN UP
ITS ACT FAST.
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT SAYING
THERE?
>> CERTAINLY THE MEDIA HAS A
ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS PROCESS.
WHEN 90% THE COVERAGE ABOUT THIS
PRESIDENT IS NEGATIVE, DESPITE
THE HISTORIC SUCCESSES, WHEN
IDEAS ARE PERPETUATED OF AN
CONTINUED NEGATIVITY NOT HELPFUL
FOR THE AMERICAN DISCOURSE.
CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT IS
CALLING ON EVERYONE TO COME
TOGETHER.
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ONE
ANOTHER, LET'S VOICE THAT BUT
LET'S DO SO PEACEFULLY AND DO
THAT AT THE BALLOT BOX.
AINSLEY: WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO
STEVE SCALISE WHERE HE WAS SHOT.
WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU AND
YOUR FAMILY IN THE RESTAURANT.
WE HAVE MAXINE WATERS THAT IS
CALLING FOR PEOPLE TO GET INTO
THE FACE OF FOLKS IN THE
ADMINISTRATION THEY DON'T AGREE
WITH.
HILLARY CLINTON SAYS WE WON'T BE
CIVIL UNTIL DEMOCRATS ARE IN
POWER.
NOT JUST SAYING IT IS DEMOCRATS
BUT IT IS ON BOTH SIDES BUT IS
THIS A GOOD REMINDER TO US WE
ALL NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK?
WE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT POLITICS,
BUT IS THIS PRETTY SCARY TO YOU,
WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE
VIOLENCE AND THREATS?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID YESTERDAY,
POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAS NO PLACE
IN OUR COUNTRY, AND IT IS
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE
WON'T TOLERATE, WE WON'T STAND
FOR.
WE'LL CONTINUE TO CONDEMN IT.
WE'LL PROVIDE EVERY RESOURCE
POSSIBLE THAT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ONLY TO
PREVENT AND STOP THESE TYPES OF
INCIDENTS BUT ALSO GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF WHO IS TRULY
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.
THAT IS THE PERSON WHO SENT THE
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES AND WE'RE
GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO ALL WE
CAN TO HELP SUPPORT LAW
ENFORCEMENT, THE SECRET SERVICE,
THE FBI, TO MAKE SURE WE FIND
OUT DETERMINE WHO EXACTLY THAT
WAS.
BRIAN: SARAH, WHAT IS HOMELAND
SECURITY DOING RIGHT NOW?
FBI IS TAKING THE LEAD.
LOCAL POLICE FORCES ARE FANNING
OUT WHETHER DELAWARE, NEW YORK,
LOS ANGELES OR FLORIDA, WHEREVER
CITY DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ IS
IN, SO I'M WONDER WHAT IS
HOMELAND SECURITY'S ROLE?
>> THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY
CAN.
THEY'RE WORKING WITH STATE AND
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, WITH THE
FBI, WITH THE UNITED STATES
SECRET SERVICE.
EVERY LEVEL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
THAT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY, WE ARE
WORKING WITH THEM AND
COORDINATING, MAKING SURE THEY
HAVE RESOURCES NEEDED TO GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF THIS.
STEVE: SARAH, LAST NIGHT AT THE
WISCONSIN RALLY, THE PRESIDENT
CALLED FOR A MORE CIVIL TONE.
THE NATION MUST STOP TREATING
POLITICAL OPPONENTS AS MORALLY
DEFECTIVE.
IS THE PRESIDENT GOING FORWARD
CHANGING HIS APPROACH TO THE
RALLY AND CRITICIZING HIS
OPPONENTS?
>> I THINK YOU SAW THAT LAST
NIGHT.
CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT WILL
CONTINUE TO POINT OUT CONTRASTS
OF POLICY BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS.
PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY HAVE A CHOICE
TO MAKE ON WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN
AND IT COULDN'T BE CLEARER.
WE COULD SEE THAT HAPPEN THE
NEXT COUPLE WEEKS WHEN THE
ELECTIONS TAKE PLACE.
THE PRESIDENT WILL CONTINUE TO
LAY OUT THAT CASE BUT AT THE
SAME TIME, WE'RE CONDEMNING
VIOLENCE AND CALLING ON ALL
AMERICANS TO COME TOGETHER.
BRIAN: WHAT IS INTERESTING,
SARAH, I THINK WE GET IT MORE
THAN MOST, WE KNEW THE PRESIDENT
BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT, AS YOU
SEE HIM GO HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH
MARCO RUBIO AND IT GOT PERSONAL.
HE WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH TED
CRUZ AND IT WAS PERSONAL, HE
WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH
RAND PAUL, IT GOT PERSONAL HE
HEALED THOSE FRIENDSHIPS.
DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT
DEFINED HE IS COMPETING WITH
ISSUES NOT PEOPLE, AND IT IS NOT
PERSONAL AND HE CAN GO FURTHER
AND DEFINE THAT?
>> THE PRESIDENT DID EXACTLY
THAT LAST NIGHT.
SCOTT WALKER WAS ALSO SOMEBODY
THE PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNED AGAINST
AT ONE POINT.
HE WAS OUT AT HIS BIGGEST
CHAMPION LAST NIGHT, LAYING OUT
THE CASE, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.
THERE IS A MAJOR POLITICAL
PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH
POINTING THOSE DIFFERENCES OUT.
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG TAKING
IT TO THE POINT OF VIOLENCE
WE'RE LOOKING AT, TAKING PLACE
OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.
THE PRESIDENT HAS CONDEMNED
THAT.
ALL OF US HAVE BUT CERTAINLY
PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE AND FRANKLY
THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSIBILITY
TO LAY OUT THE POLITICAL
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEMOCRATS
AND REPUBLICANS AS WE HEAD INTO
A MIDTERM ELECTION.
PRESIDENT HAS HAD A GREAT TWO
YEARS IN OFFICE, HE HAS A STORY
TO TELL AND HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO
EXPRESS THAT AND TALK ABOUT IT
AND CONTRAST.
AINSLEY: PACKAGES WERE SENT IN
THE PAST TO REPUBLICANS.
ALL THESE IN THE PAST TWO DAYS
HAVE BEEN DEMOCRATIC LIBERAL
FIGURES BUT YOU'RE IN THE
SPOTLIGHT.
YOU WORK FOR THIS
ADMINISTRATION.
THERE ARE CRAZY PEOPLE OUT
THERE.
HAS THIS CHANGED THE WAY YOU
LIVE YOUR LIFE?
>> THANKS CHANGED THE WAY I WAS
LIVING MY LIFE OVER THE LAST
SEVERAL MONTHS.
NOT FORGET AN MSNBC ANCHOR SAID
SOMEONE SHOULD RING MY NECK.
A "WASHINGTON POST" COLUMNIST
SAID I DESERVE AD LIFETIME OF
HARRASSMENT.
I WAS FIRST WHITE HOUSE PRESS
SECRETARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE
WHITE HOUSE HAVE TO HAVE UNITED
STATES SECRET SERVICE.
THEY DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE
SOMEBODY SAID NASTY THINGS.
THEY DO THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE
CREDIBLE THREATS.
ABSOLUTELY I UNDERSTAND THIS AND
THREATS PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING
OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.
I THINK IT IS DESPICABLE, I
THINK IT IS HORRIBLE.
WHY THE PRESIDENT IS EXACTLY
RIGHT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO
CONDEMN THIS VIOLENCE CALL IT
OUT EXACTLY NOR WHAT IT IS.
STEVE: THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR
A MORE CIVIL TONE.
SOME ON THE LEFT, HEY, ALL THE
STUFF WITH THE BOMBS BEING
MAILED AROUND, THAT IS THE
PRESIDENT'S FAULT.
>> I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY
DISGRACEFUL THAT ONE OF THE
FIRST PUBLIC STATEMENTS WE HEARD
FROM CNN YESTERDAY WAS TO PUT
THE BLAME AND RESPONSIBILITY OF
THIS DESPICABLE ACT ON THE
PRESIDENT AND ON ME PERSONALLY.
WHEN THE PERSON THAT IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS IS THE
PERSON WHO MADE AND CREATED AND
PUT THESE SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES IN
THE HANDS, IN THE ARMS OF
INNOCENT AMERICAN CITIZENS.
THAT'S THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE.
I FIND THAT DISGRACEFUL THAT WAS
ONE OF THE FIRST STATEMENTS IS,
THEY MADE THIS AND TRIED TO PUT
THE BLAME ON THE PRESIDENT.
BRIAN: YOU ANSWERED JEFF ZUCKER
RIGHT ON TWITTER RIGHT AWAY.
HE HAS NOT RESPONDED.
WE SEE PUBLICLY.
WE SAW "THE NEW YORK TIMES"
TODAY.
THEY DO HAVE A FANTASY, A
FANTASY SCENARIO FROM FICTION
WRITERS TALKING ABOUT ONE
SCENARIO WHERE THE PRESIDENT
GETS ASSASSINATED, WHERE THE
SECRET SERVICE COLLABORATES WITH
RUSSIANS TO KILL HIM.
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT?
>> I FIND IT ABSOLUTELY
ABHORRENT AND DISGRACEFUL.
IT IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF THING
THE PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT
IS THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY IS
SOUTHERNLY NOT HELP -- CERTAINLY
NOT HELPFUL, CERTAINLY NOT AT
THIS TIME.
STEVE: I FIND IT INCREDIBLE THAT
THEY RAN IT TODAY.
>> I FIND IT SHOCKING THEY RAN
IT TODAY.
BRIAN: THEY'RE SCRAMBLING WHAT
IS GOING ON IN DELAWARE.
WE ASSUME SOMETHING TO DO WITH
JOE BIDEN'S ADDRESS.
THIS MORNING WE WAKE UP AND FIND
OUT THAT ROBERT DE NIRO'S
RESTAURANT HAD PACKAGE IN IT AND
WE ASSUME BOMB-MAKING MATERIALS
INSIDE.
I KNOW YOU HAVE A SCHEDULE SET
UP.
DO YOU WANT TO ANNOUNCE ANYTHING
THAT MIGHT BE CHANGING?
>> I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN BRIEFED ON
BOTH OF THESE LATEST INCIDENTS
BY CHIEF OF STAFF KELLY, AND
PROBABLY RECEIVED FURTHER
BRIEFING LATER THIS MORNING.
YESTERDAY HE WAS BRIEFED BY THE
UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,
THE FBI, THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE AND DHS HEADS.
WE'RE CONTINUING TO MONITOR
THIS, LOOK FOR WAYS TO PREVENT
IT.
FRANKLY FIND OUT AT THE END OF
THE DAY WHO IS FULLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS.
MAKE SURE THAT WE BRING JUSTICE
TO THAT INDIVIDUAL OR
INDIVIDUALS.
AINSLEY: THERE IS A TWEET FROM
JOHN BRENNAN, RESPONSE TO THE
PRESIDENT, HE IS ONE OF THE ONES
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GET ONE OF
THESE PACKAGES, THIS IS THE ONE
THEY SENT TO CNN HE JUST TWEETED
THIS.
STOP BLAMING OTHERS.
LOOK IN THE MIRROR.
YOUR INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC,
INSULTS, LIES AND ENCOURAGEMENT
OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE ARE
DISGRACEFUL.
CLEAN UP YOUR ACT.
TRY TO ACT PRESIDENTIAL.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE MUCH
BETTER.
BY THE WAY YOUR CRITICS WILL NOT
BE INTIMIDATED INTO SILENCE.
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION?
>> LOOK, THE PRESIDENT, I THINK
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE
PRESIDENTIAL YESTERDAY WHEN HE
SPOKE DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
HE CONDEMNED THIS VIOLENCE.
LET'S NOT GET LOST IN WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HEINOUS
ACT.
IT IS THE PERSON WHO MADE AND
SENT THESE SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES.
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THAT IS
ULTIMATELY THE PERSON THAT IS
RESPONSIBLE AND WILL BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE BY THIS
ADMINISTRATION.
BRIAN: NO REACTION DIRECTLY TO
JOHN BRENNAN WHO SEEMS TO BE
BREAKING WITH TRADITION AS A
FORMER HEAD OF THE CIA, BECOMING
WHAT SEEMS TO BE A PUNDIT?
>> I THINK WE'VE MADE OUR
OPINIONS ON FORMER DIRECTOR
BRENNAN PRETTY CLEAR OVER THE
PAST SEVERAL MONTHS.
CERTAINLY DON'T SUPPORT THE TYPE
OF ACTIVITY THAT HE IS ENPAGED
IN AND DON'T THINK IT IS
BECOMING SOMEONE A FORMER
DIRECTOR OF THE INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY THAT HE WAS.
STEVE: SIDE NOTE, OF COURSE THE
MIDTERM ELECTIONS ARE A LITTLE
LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AWAY.
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT AND HIS
TEAM HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT
APPARENTLY HE WILL MAKE SOME
OTHER STOPS.
GIVEN WHAT IS GOING ON WITH
THESE PACKAGES, WILL HE CONTINUE
ON THIS VERY AGGRESSIVE
CAMPAIGNING WITH THE RALLIES AND
WHAT NOT?
OR WILL THEY PARE THINGS BACK OR
WHAT IS GOING ON?
>> CERTAINLY AS OF RIGHT NOW THE
PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO LAY OUT
THE CASE AND POLITICAL
DIFFERENCES OF DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS, AS HE CERTAINLY
SHOULD.
FUTURE AND HISTORY OF OUR
COUNTRY IS AT STAKE.
AMERICANS HAVE A DECISION TO
MAKE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS
AND PRESIDENT WILL LAY OUT THE
CASE FOR WHY REPUBLICANS HAVE
BEEN SUCCESSFUL OVER THE LAST
TWO YEARS UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP.
WE HAVE A BOOMING ECONOMY.
WE HAVE A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF JOB
CREATION, PARTICULARLY IN
MANUFACTURING, WE HAVE TRADE
DEALS THAT EVERYONE SAID
COULDN'T BE DONE.
WE HAVE A NATIONAL SECURITY
ISSUE AT THE BORDER AND WE HAVE
TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT
LAW AND ORDER AT THE BORDER OR
WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT OPEN
BORDER.
THE PRESIDENT WILL LAY OUT THE
CASE AND AMERICANS WILL MICK A
DECISION AND I THINK THEY WILL
MAKE RIGHT ONE.
BRIAN: 12 DAYS AND COUNTING.
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, THANKS
