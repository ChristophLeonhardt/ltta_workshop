golden showers tape from the long discredited democrat funded steel dossier here is the trailer grab them by the place talking about sixteen-year-old girls in their underwear here okay viewing racial slurs list of celebrity apprentice don't worry tom arnold is on it and I'm Tom Arnold tomb√© here that was strange well my here's my first question yes with many things than the broom closet of the ben shapiro show yeah fix it in post right my first question for you this is a show as people will have seen now in post-production yeah this is let me explain something to you young man a golden shower is there's a difference between a golden shower and a an ulcer to feed a hooker and a model so so that you that's a red herring sir okay there was no golden shower there was a model urinating on a bed because because Donald Trump doesn't like Barack Obama would you agree that Donald Trump doesn't like Barack Obama agree that a half the people in this room don't like Barack Obama because we're very lucky to have Vice joining us today to be filming this report of the show right usually it's a hundred percent of the people in the room but have you ever had a sub what urinate on the bed because you don't like Barack Obama dude is that the level of dislike from Brock Obama that you have will it never occurred to me that my level of dislike for Barack Obama was such that I would even vote for Mitt Romney to get rid of Barack Obama well that's interesting my that's my first question this whole thing is about this Terry we just interviewed I just interviewed David cord yeah and because of him and his dang of tape recording having that waiter tape record bit Robbie we could be in the second term of that Romney's presidency right now that's true that is your right and once were dating David core David corn gave us Donald Trump he kept us down from do you have the tape do you have the Russia urination on the bed Barack Obama tape I'm a hundred percent sure it exists how are you sure you don't have it yourself I don't have it myself but I've also shared the steel dossier is a hundred percent real okay but even Democrats now we're saying that steel dossier is I mean we know demonstrably some of it is first of all can we agree on what they Democrats are idiots well do we agree that not all of them but you know right they got all the cameras go on and Republicans aren't morons can we agree with that I can agree with the first part more you saying already say sup about Donald Trump I love the way you talk about him you talk about him like a second grader talks about Santa Claus two toddlers you're like God come on he doesn't go to every house on Christmas Eve that's a that's a story yeah he's a story so but yet I'm gonna save at all the trouble he is outside of Macy's telling everyone he goes to every house of Christmas Eve he truly does - he's that crazy well he has been giving us wonderful gift since he was inaugurated I get in that way I think he's like Donald like 40 this is my question so you don't you don't have the tape but you're sure it exists yeah why lived in the Bosco Ritz they do tape everything you do that of course they do that goes without saying and it's kind of funny how they do it they brag about their technological advancements at the Moscow Ritz and the irony there is because they're recording everything you're doing right but we know you know that he went to a PP party this summer before in in Las Vegas said he went to a PP show and I have a picture of him doing that the summer before that do you so it's a cop Michael Isikoff yeah in their book there's a picture of him doing that so the groundwork was laid he went to a show where a woman PETA to a champagne flute there's a picture of him doing that the summer before this but here's the thing Tom you're Russian Roulettes the name of the book you love books please read that I will I really I really don't use words yeah you do I know that's right that is so funny the book you wrote with that thank you very much so you're making a waste of paper what trees are an organic renewable resource I'm saving the environment by printing that book otherwise it will turn you have amazing hair son stop it you're gonna make me blush yeah you make a lot of these claims that the tape exists the Democrats have been looking for this tape we know the Democrats funded that steel dossier we know a lot of it has been started I know the Democrats really funded a lot of it we know that both Republicans and Democrats have used fusion GPS for opposition research yes of course right the steel dossier you say it's not accurate the steel dossier I'm so absolutely it's not accurate we know that how do you how do you what's not accurate okay give me something I'll go through points my points okay so in the steel dossier this is quoting from the steel dossier the Russian regime has been cultivating supporting assisting Trump for at least five years aim endorsed by Putin has been to encourage splits and divisions in the Western alliance can't be true what's going on by the way what what about the new this week with our alliances and the g7 and what's going on with Trump and Canada the split is not true about that well then surely with what Trudeau and Trump in our lives and what's going on with Germany is absolutely true all of our allies we're not getting along with them we're gonna be sunny North Korea and indeed Boonton and China and not our allies anymore that's exactly what's happening brother under the Obama administration our allies paid far less for their involvement in NATO Oh seriously both Barack Obama and his predecessor encouraged the our allies in NATO to actually pay their fair share so that's really what is about okay that's that's good news to you no no because so that is what's happening what that is better they didn't say anything about there's nothing steel talking about oh they're gonna pay more money those words you just read are happening right now in real time well here here's okay here's some pretty strange ones so here's another line from the steel dossier okay the it alludes to the existence of a Russian dossier or compra Matt on Hillary Clinton is confirmed by source be she or he confided in a trusted compatriot than it had been collated by Department K of the FSB for many years except the Directorate K which is an infamous part of Russian intelligence doesn't do intelligence on foreign leaders it that SVR does fapsi does but not director it K so it just doesn't add up okay sure what you just said but they got some on Hillary get it because dinner what I should be president anymore that means nothing they're living case away the first thing you read is absolutely true because there is everything you said so you're saying that Russia predicted in 2011 that Donald Trump could become the president of United States Russia Vladimir Putin being the only person on earth who predicted that Donald Trump could be the president of United States no Donald with Donald Trump called said that brocco bomb was not born here he started the birther campaign in 2011 people rose up and supported him did anybody seriously think that he would become the president 2011 I know in 2013 but Vladimir Putin called his room in the in Moscow ritz-carlton and he Donald Trump put that call at a speakerphone and that some people I know that were with the Miss Universe contest and he said to everybody I want you to be the president we will support your date way we can't but this is the problem Tom you hear all the time well he is the president and this is happening but so yeah that's been staying in the moment here but here's the problem the question has been we have these tapes that was what we don't know someone has works he just cited with he gave stuff to North Korea that's just we said ok don't war war exercises what is the war game scheduled we're games no but you heard his words you heard his word for Santa Claus like Santa didn't really do that when is that war game scheduled for it's not scheduled I know you're you're being practical you should be the president but you're not for real I got the German for president oh he is out of his mind I know first of all I know him I've been to the Playboy Mansion with him I was at the creepy guy I brought in 30 years I wish you're president you're a smart kid you know I'm glad you're around you know but hit but he's insane okay and but I wonder is we always hear his stupid he's insane from people who know him he's exactly as it was 30 years ago but he keeps being successful and this is my real question he gave way that is he successful we are losing everything he everyday we we risk losing everything there's people propping him up I'm not saying you I'm saying you're like oh no what he really means no he is that batshit crazy okay but look at the the actual facts on the ground he's a straight-up racist looking at his policies lewdness fazio the totality is racist he they're ripping people from the mothers children from their mothers at the borders it's not it's a policy reporting illegal aliens no no no no but there's a cruelty to it but it's Michael but what's the racist Michael there's a great season so it's always brown people I'm telling you grasping white people are crossing the border from Mexico that's true but if it were white people crossing the borders as it wouldn't be deported we shouldn't enforce immigration I'm telling you something about it I'm telling you is there countries I'm telling you there is a difference there is a difference or it's just some lovely Machado I get I get what you're doing the point is that I know the guy - I spent time with the guy it is different you there's no reason to rip babies from their mothers period well anywhere anywhere that there's no so you're saying you know are you a father no there's different you that's a different that's right Harry that's different this different house that we have it does really or Americans we don't do that we're better than that we don't enforce our immigration don't know because we have humanity there are ways to do things and we're better than that but don't you think Morgan's have a right to determine who gets to come in there yes that's right we do mid crimes yeah we can do it the American Way because we're better than that's the American Way we hit with humanity and with respect so you're saying don't deport illegal aliens no I've said you do you absolutely do so you do it the right way the American Way and they treat people with respect and you treat people well and you don't rip people apart and you don't use that you know that's how you know that's how you're talking about those images of the kids and the cages and all that kind of so no I'm talking about literally what they're doing right but Barack Barack of all there we are you a father all right well it's a big country and it's a wise man who knows who his father is but none that I know of all right do I say you're not fine well if you were just a man if you were and I have imagined your son being taken from you if you could imagine that feeling yeah I don't want my son to cross illegally into another country - okay and I wouldn't do it on his behalf no but you don't understand what's your parent you'll understand there's something inside of you but I'm not going to another country so that I don't need to be disrespectful of you or you know what you're talking about okay until your parrot what's your parent you know you you can't even imagine it's always who opposed illegal immigration yeah there's you it's you absolutely opposed there's just a humane way of doing things do you think that the people who voted for Donald Trump half the country that they're racist deplorable irredeemable know that would be as bad as being you and say oh it's about you they get blankets sabers like oh you can't deport illegal aliens no you humanity you have to have humanity especially when you have to think about where the earth is one planet okay do you believe in God Francis yes okay then take a step back if you believe in God so you think God is like deport people deport me w manatee no humanity Michael dolls no people old no Betty these are the boss the God is God is God of perfect justice and perfect mercy which is very difficult for us but we know from Saint Paul's epistles that the civil authority is endowed with a right to enforce the law isn't that right that's first of all Jewish mercy tell me about the mercy at the border of taking babies from their mothers intentionally to be punitive to be punitive and these mothers are escaping domestic violence to get to America the land of the free the home of the brave just to get an opportunity to save their children's lives and tell me about Jesus and I saw the Jesus documentary that Mark Burnett made or the the base you want to read the book it's a good book well I've read this chapter the first chapter or the first part do you wonder what Jesus think about all this we're real what would Jesus think about the civil government enforcing the law well I'll take it from his apostle that it is perfectly right for the civil government to afford enforce the law and what do you think about these money guys these billions the well they were I don't know how many billionaires there were at the time he did let's talk with us for you this for this this talk with your heart for a second yeah baby speed yank from there both it just says is there not a better way to do this what is the better way first of all we're not we're not deporting little babies and said nobody mother's day the babies go to Honduras but the mothers stay in America that's not what help babies go to Chicago Widow tell what the mothers where they are it's not except listen we could do better yeah we could do better the most charitable immigration regime in the entire we have the hi no no we go you run this better than they do down there you know where that monitor is you got a better crew here people listen you don't know what they're doing either yeah we we apprehend over a thousand people a day crossing illegal into this country at the border and three years we bred a horrible meat packing plant better they don't know what they're doing yet let's say they just change the policy they don't have things set up they don't have housing set up we knew we had hog refinment there are you don't know I'm telling you haven't been there I'm telling you I've the people down there I've been day I don't know there's not about setting up tents it's a freaking hundred degrees in here do they go to heaven set up Tom do you know what makes that so hard what we apprehend a thousand people they're great they're human beings whole lot they're human beasts we would not allow our port to cattle to be treated like this right now because legally you can't you have to have certain kind of facilities right now they just say well we on how many how many people that we apprehend at the border every day do we just send right back to their country as as probably we should you know how many people we do that do you ever have zero people do it for a second and I know the bleeding heart liberals I know it could be bullshit I know they're way over the fuckin top but for a second and can you not think that way could you think it would be going against rub for a second can you die can you not go I think Americans have a right to to the their own democratically enacted laws by partisan laws to decide who comes in and who comes out we have the highest highest rates of immigration until recently because it's dropped under under Donald Trump but we have the highest percentage of foreign-born population in American history since 1890 under the best of circumstances assimilation is difficult under these sort of circumstances it's virtually impossible 80 percent of women and girls who cross the border you know I think about this we hated Italians everybody hated Italians Americans did not want to tell us here it was like dodo they were stored they were the scum of the earth you probably don't remember this your parents your grandparents to tell you about this did not what they did not want to tell you is here and just read this right oh you've read books and they were scored if they were they were looked down upon and it was awful Tom it was awful but according to Amnesty International and the Huffington Post not exactly right-wing outlets between 60 and 80 percent of women and girls who crossed the border illegally raped and sexually assaulted what is compassionate or merciful or humanitarian about encouraging a regime encouraging the human traffickers who bring those women and girls across the border and rape them along the way it's a red herring it's a red herring 16 80 percent is red herring it's a reddit uart but it's what we do when they get to the border to rip their children apart we need to take that that's our policy to scare them to go back we're gonna take your children for them Tom I don't I don't I think there's a federal statute to rip children away fro there do it it's policy you will you look at to it for me you do something about it with me I if it's a we we do if if there's a federal policy traditions run away from there okay mothers take the children away for their parents too there has been suicides of the parents because they could find their children well there when people do get to the border they do have to be processed there they're okay and I certainly true there's a national policy there's a form of local child that was taken from her mother yesterday will you at least investigate this with it horrible things happen because of illegal immigration okay so stop illegal immigration okay so you're not denied is true I know I'm I'm actually saying it's much worse than you are saying it is I'm saying illegal immigration causes many many more problems than you're saying it is which is why we need to cut off all incentives for it and enforce our immigration laws and have the we could do it we could do better I'd well it's easy to say these slogans right it's and it's easy for this innuendo this is the question that I want to get to because right now the economy's going gangbusters it's doing better than it ever has before rich people for corporations for is you know whatever everybody just got a tax cut the economy's don't know very well come on this you know they're faster than the doing very well stock you say but I don't know nevertheless very much your feelings yeah yeah yeah historically your feelings these people you still gotta care about people but but this is reality this is reality is that your reality but you know you're responsible but there's only one reality time no no no that's not true if you have to accept there are there are other realities if you think your reality is the only one you're for I think we've explained the democrat-republican device well there's one big rub your you'd defend a guy who's is a complete alternate reality Donald truck lies everyday 50 times day and then you explain it for us well first of all I'll explain that explaining right after I make a little bit of money we

that Trump you're in tape right Democrats it seems to me they are distracting from all of the good things that are happening in this country with innuendo and implications and the fantasies of other realities that are fantasies well it is true that we are far apart because we I guess we feel like you're totally over here with the fantasy the Donald Trump is infallible and everything isn't what have I ever said he said what okay gimme the bill okay Dave one thing that he's absolutely lied about that he well I think Donald Trump talks like a New Yorker so I'll give you a nice gives even out that well no it but it really ok give me the example so the example is this Donald Trump says we have you know oh we had the biggest crowds ever for this we had 60,000 people at such and such a rally now in reality maybe the rally only had 30 or 40 thousand people I'm willing to acknowledge that the way New Yorkers talk is a little hyperbolic he goes out he says you know this is the most tremendous thing that's ever happened in the history of the world maybe it's not the most tremendous thing that's ever happened but it's it's a hyperbole and it leads into an exuberance I don't think that's the kind of lie is saying if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor which the former press like that's a terror three thousand lies you don't think that man is straight-up lied to the American people what is he lied about everything he is like what he said my rich Reds are really bad about this tax break god help ya it it raised taxes on the up on people in New York and Los Angeles on me and on people in the up higher highest income bracket raise taxes on them yeah it did but all the truth because he hates me all the trillions of dollars you should have coming back into this country yeah there are over we have repatriated money from the skies of trillions rated jobs as well you know there's my family will not benefit they have not got a better to real time this family vodka Jared they will not benefit from working in my administration whatever they benefit eighty two million dollars last year that family benefited well the truck yeah the Trump Organization is still in operation sure the Trump Organization making her smile a personally made how much how much money how much money did Barack Obama have going into the presidency and leaving the president okay tanea more like 3 billion Barack Obama was a freaking president of the United Sates wasn't a small advise a senior advisor how much okay Louis is how many times Barack Obama golf and how many times have you complained about it I don't mind oh you never complain about the go get my did Donald Trump but hey Joseph said I will never go he's golf ten times more do you ever call him out on his how many times he calls other people oh this is actually getting to the central point of your TV show and my criticism of the I don't trust him negotiating anything for us I think the Donald Trump is a Russian asset I don't think he knows it what's your evidence I don't think he does it what's your evidence he is in love with Putin he has it he is a Putin does have something on him what he doesn't know but he won't let us investigate he won't let us follow through they battled in our election he said every time they metal in the election they spent $100,000 on Facebook ads few not adjusted to our own intelligence what intelligence are you referring to because I'm citing 200,000 oh okay you aren't privy to it because it's the NSA the CIA and the FBI they've shared all that with but a metal specifically because it's easy to accept I'm not privy to it either I can tell you and they a higher percent certainty I can share that with the field an IKE I can tell you how the Russians meddled in the Alliance by the way I think they fixed the election for Delta it's not like they just spent a hundred thousand think thinks he's an illegitimate president and he does it and that's why he's fighting this he says he is not the president he doesn't deserve to be the president Tom it's in he is not the president he's an illegitimate president I know everything he accused Barack Obama that's him he's not the president he took all our health insurance away how he did that yeah Donald say that's another thing he is trying to take people's health insurance away just because Barack Obama gave it to that Tom I liked my doctor and I didn't get to Kaiba done you want to do I quit my place he's gonna do it again is it 18 and dumb folks could make sure he doesn't stop him Tom he's not protecting our our ballot boxes are voting machines when you're talking about Russia do it again Donald listen the Senate had a hearing yesterday and they're freaked out about it because he's not doing anything about it that bothers me bori is a basic tenant of our vegetable that's why Republicans are trying to protect the integrity of the Bella bond why did they show up for that Senate hearing Republican centers did not show up where is their beholding Donald Trump hey take your time if you want to protect the integrity of the ballot box do you think that people should have to show an ID to vote I think you should protect us from Russia number one not from Americans protect us from outside Thor listen to John McCain John McCain usually not great advice it's John McCain really really I'll take John McCain over and over Donald Trump there any of these guys I know the players much prefer John McCain to conservative Republicans that's true that's very true anybody if you if you're not taking John McCain as a patriot a manager stood up there yeah yeah but I don't like his political views really I don't be I think he wanted to go out with the go get stuffing guy says you know here's the lied the the versus outside forces it's John McCain it got its proved it every time better than you or me or Donald Trump who's put himself on the line for this country it's John McCain okay yeah forget long he served yes for beyond served admirably they can say gage for five years yeah extremely Admiral okay but that doesn't mean that his political views have politics I'm talking about he's an American patriot that put yourself on the light and this is what it's like because they're gonna screw around with art and you're about that oh don't you want to take away votes oh you gotta show it I want to take away ah I'm talking about Russian I want it out of our election but Tom what are you doing to keep the Belvoir like sure you want to keep people of color for Bodie by short IDs or will it be when if I ever gets murders white people to vote are they heard for Russians to vote no Tom that is a real accusation is black people fucking well you see what it what that you you see how many people can't vote you said it okay so who do you got what to vote Americans I don't want Russia's to vote well really I don't want Democrats to vote for right okay she has the right to vote everybody markets voting stop Russians were voting Tom I want people who have the right to vote to be able to vote and I want people who don't have the right to vote to not be a bit slight but it's such a stupid thing like two people out of a billion fed vote more than once and that's you're making a big deal you think there are two Illig yeah I think that's stupid over there stop Russians from voting put your energies to that this is an argument you know there's many all you tried try to get Democrats so they can't vote so you gear he just want to suppress black people and Republicans votes that's what you do you know that's a big accusation just say it's an absolute fact that you do it what is your evidence not facts look at facts how many 20 Tom it's a fact look at Ohio how many people you stop foreboding there are people of color because they are Democrats you're right Tom you're just saying things that are fantasies no no like I've seen their facts why don't you stop Russia's voting put your be in America political I think okay I don't think a lot of Russian nationals voted in our last election I don't think they were here campaigning or here pretending they were lobbying Hillary Clinton to even Fox disprove that disprove luck the Chevy Shepard Smith I'll send you the clip with it what is that is it read Harry what did right here you know that Tom you can go that you can interrupt and distract and use profanity all you want well we will edit it sorry but Tom you can distract and you can change the subject and you can interrupt all you want that doesn't change judicial jobs bill on is he's a source D the Christopher steel as opposed to fly down to view oh he is sourced well there are those who's in the room for the PP stuff so there's a steel dossier because we still go see it paid for by Democrats and lied about by Democrat elide about by demo what do you they lied they lied about their involvement in it but it's also an election it's all true though but we know that some appear in this group we know that we know that it's been disproved by keep going it's a coffin cord have proved it and I have a guest that's great for you and keep them really prove it so bloody Christopher seals a hero this guy came to the aid of the United States working for an interloper interfering in our elections that's why they're called allies we called out you know our greatest allies so who do you think our allies are Jean Kim eel or whatever yeah little rocket me yeah I you know seriously who D their allies are I'm our allies or our allies and allies David oh I suppose Italy I'll use my own heritage a moment France really likes us now the French premier Emmanuel macron loves Donald dramati also said drop don't be giving stay this week a buddy back Israel is an ally of ours they're very happy with us now because Barack Obama turned on our news he'd ever seen he what do you dog it here because what is it about that guy what is it that you guys feel you get blamed stuff on it he what is see what's different is a terrible terrible president how much the country immensely yeah that's why I keep talking about I think there's something else about him there's something about him a far left wing Democrat who damaged the country who destroyed 1/6 of you think about what the worst economic recovery since you're aware with the way he took over will you give it that did you know facts would you remember the economy there was a there was a financial crisis it was almost a depression we've been a to war give him that give it well you know no give of that it is true that the vast majority of deaths American soldier deaths in Afghanistan occurred under Barack Obama's watch it also created more come on come on you're smart kid I give of this too he was the first black American president you remember that that's a big deal this country what you're saying is the people are racist but this country had slavery on him give a bet we bid through a lot of this company had slit there we rode so big acknowledge that that's a big deal and we went through Jim Crow we feel it don't overlook who denies they don't acknowledge that that we went through a lot so it was a big deal for all of us then when he was elected a college been a good president take a moment did you see like it you talk like that is a terrible president no

don't see the the left making TV shows about the terrible economy or TV shows about the terrible foreign affairs or the TV shows about all the terrible oppression going on in the country because they couldn't none of that is happening all we're seeing shows on our stormy Daniels the porn star and the the elusive tapes from a long discredited dossier and the business and than that we're you know and and oh I heard he said a bad word on tape or this or that isn't that just because Democrats are distracting from how everything is going tickety-boo you know I guess we're all just going about our business you guys are our baking shows you know you guys are hit the save beat to your you just said going about but we're not making up stories well why don't you're pretending they don't exist you're just going over you're just kind of going up here there are a lot of tongues show me that show me the tape of the Russian models urinating on the bed and okay it's real show me the tape right now and lo I gotta savor it it's gonna be on my show but you have so now you're saying you do have the tape I've said I play no buts do you have that I'd say that I'd say you will see you've entrusted a cold us means I'll tell you what you can see if you don't think Trump says he had word if you don't think Trump calls women all kinds of Phil now you will see that it's that we have the tape of Donald Trump saying the N word do we have a can we play it there are white use that word today our country has lost a true American original my friend and mentor Robert C bird there are white senator Byrd was a man of surpassing eloquence and nobility I've seen a lot of white might I'm gonna use that word senator Byrd was a man of surpassing eloquence and nobility today our country has lost a true American original my friend and mentor Robert seabird guys was that Donald Trump who was that Donald Trump or was that a former Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd the Democrat whom Hillary Clinton referred to as her great friend and mentor was that what I think it was the demin to do the story about this is most hilarious using the n-word he's Robert Verdi everybody's using it you've never said the Edward I think I read a beat packing plant Hey you probably heard these words but you heard he course I am 30 Iowa but so has it my next-door neighbor's dog was named the Edward bear like source are you gonna so are you defending Donald Trump for allegedly using a racial slur in alleged video that nobody's seen are you defending him now because everybody said it yeah see gotta trip white here's him say the n-word why of course he said it's yours it's when you are a bird and Hillary Clinton using and you yourself say everybody's use these slurs you really she's not the president so you thank you yeah good lord do you feel totally confident that he will not get us in some sort of war I think he has been incredible on Paris do you think he will not get a civil war Michael I tell you I've asked you serious you think that one military soldier will die because of it I've got know what's worse happen all the time I mean we decide them well the boys are Astana but I care you know I don't think they get all do you I've been to Afghanistan I've been to Iraq I'm in all places I talked to the families I do a lot of service work of that area do you feel comfortable telling the servicemen and women and their families America that that guy has gotten together enough do not risk the lives of any man and woman well the military risks their lives to defend the country and the times Hannah a hundred percent he's I am 100% confident that he is a much more competent commander in chief then we've seen in recent years and certainly more so than Barack Obama and 100% confident of that confident do you feel he's confident yes I do I think he's I think if you just look at how is handling we know that Isis has been utterly militarily demolished we're seeing some progress being made on the Korean situation it's the first inning but it's being made that's pretty good we're seeing our allies finally coming around and cooperating with international agreements we're seeing countries like China who have violated World Trade Organization trees for years finally coming to the table and negotiating we're seeing the IMF the International Monetary Fund saying that Donald Trump is responsible for the surge in the global economy I am totally confident in this president shocking as it is on his handling of foreign affairs absolutely and I see no evidence to the contrary Feuer father you might take pause before saying that I'm just telling I'm just selling you how how are you guys I would I would change I would say okay I'm not gonna ignore those facts no no it would be again but like the thing at the border with the kids we take it away from parents it would be more personal but no change reality it does change reality what's your parent this reality changes Tom we have actually hit on I've got to let you go because I don't but this we have actually hit on this the difference here is I'm sitting here saying look there's only this one reality that's happening and you are literally saying right now the personal is different than the reality there's the subjective reality there are multiple realities that explains it that explains the show that explains the Democrat campaigns for the last two years more than that Tom alright great to have you on thank you so much I really and I really have to say this because this is a very fun conversation no Democrats no left wingers ever come on my show and you agreed to come on my show yeah great you're great all right thank you very much good luck to you all right we've got to cut out of here before we get to all the rest of the news if we have like five minutes left go to daily wire calm right now if you are a subscriber if you're not go come on subscribe it's ten bucks a month one hundred hours for an annual membership you get me you get the under Clavin sure you get the Ben Shapiro show you get the leftist tears tumblr which Tom even Tom very graciously drank out of so you've got to get it it's fda-approved baby go over there to daily we're calm we'll be right back with the rest of the news thank you we're back okay we've got a lot to talk about it was really nice to have time on town by the way if you I don't want to keep you hostage here right if you if you want to hop that maybe I'll say yeah order my stuff fish oil and my stuff from your site website this is really good this is the best ad reads that we've ever gotten all right we've got to get back into this so I said this was we're talking about a lot of smoke and mirrors here all of the emotivism all of the innuendo not so much of the facts listen to this from the Southern Poverty Law Center you know because we could we could just call all the news today frivolous nonsense so we're focusing on the Southern Poverty Law Center because they've named my little old me my Prager you video the most egregious Praeger video of all time and it's the video in which I attack the racists of the alternative right but they're really upset so here so what is the Southern Poverty Law Center it's this massively funded propaganda machine it's just this leftist propaganda machine that's all it is they you know they have this patina of credibility because they have a interesting sounding name they are nothing they spent 10 million dollars on fund raising in 2015 way more than they did on legal services they transferred millions to offshore tax havens they smeared the Family Research Council which is a protrude ischl family group a gunman who shot up that council cited the influence of the Southern Poverty Law Center in his shooting there was mob violence at Charles Murray's speech at Middlebury a faculty member who was there cited Southern Poverty Law Center again as justification two years ago the FBI totally stopped citing SPLC as a source because it's so frivolous probably shouldn't have nonprofit status its founder is just a direct marketing guru Morris Dees he was actually inducted into the direct marketing Hall of Fame real civil rights activists call him a con man and but he's so effective because all he does is rely on innuendo just like we were talking about with Tom it's that exact it's all well what do you you don't think this exists what you come on you know don't you really think it's all just innuendo and so ironically the Southern Poverty Law Center has become a hate group they're like against hate groups and they become a hate group this is what they wrote about my video from the Southern Poverty Law Center quote the most egregious of Praeger use videos in trip odious opinion is what is the all right hosted by conservative internet talk show host Michael Knowles the video posits that is an alternative to conservatism the OL tried is most accurately compared with the left for three reasons the left and the alright are obsessed with identity politics both focus on group identity rather than the individual and both the left and the old right ultimately reject God the video ends with Knowles declaring in other words the old right has nothing in common with conservatism and is in fact much closer to the left ISM except of course that the left is much much larger that's all they wrote they said it's the most egregious video and then they just quote my video but they don't give any evidence for why it's egregious they don't give any argument for why it's egregious they just they make a blanket statement and then they just fill it in with words they just try to distract with frivolous nonsense right it's just these distractions this wasn't don't you think the economy's doing well don't talk about the economy talk about this imaginary video that where everyone's been talking about well but don't you think the Foreign Affairs no don't talk about that don't to talk about right it's all just distraction and by the way this this is how Donald Trump won I know it's become cliche to say this is how Donald Trump won or this is how Donald Trump won this is actually how he won have you have you heard about the ongoing saga of chick-fil-a so right there was an article in The Huffington Post it said if you really love LGBTQ people you just can't keep eating chick-fil-a the you can't so if you really like gay people you can't eat chicken sandwiches and this is what the article said it said quote if you care about queer people or yourself or you yourself are queer you have absolutely no business eating a chick-fil-a ever it's really that straightforward and they they deem them because chick-fil-a donates to the Salvation Army which is Christian and if it's Christian then it's bad because it's not part of the Pride movement or something the the politicization of everything is so tedious this this base innuendo that everybody who doesn't agree with you is a bigot or a racist or at this or that you know it's so it's so tedious and it's so divisive I mean even you know the the acronym LGBTQ is by definition divisive right because it keeps dividing it says LGBT QP LMNOP or so what it just keeps going on and on and on to divide into smaller and smaller interest groups there isn't much of a common culture anymore there isn't you don't see a lot of common culture we don't watch the same TV shows we do know it's I I'm gonna watch Tom Arnold's show because you know we had him on but I suspect a lot of our audience probably isn't gonna watch his show and it's not that we all watch different things different movies different knows different we read different books if we read it all we don't have a common religion we don't even have a common traditional love of country and this is what makes Donald Trump appealing because Donald Trump appeals to like the last remaining things that unite us I'm not saying this is a good thing or a bad thing I wish there was more that United us but he appeals to winning at least everybody should want winning right he appeals to good deals we're gonna get good deals right okay that appeals to all of us strength peace even football right he you know when a football at least you think that could unite all of us and then that guy Colin Kaepernick tried to make that that divisive as well and tried to protest against the symbol of America itself he called them out on it people don't want that this presidency ironically of Donald Trump is essentially a call for unity again in its own very brash trumpian way you know he says things like we all have the same blood of patriots we all bleed the same blood of patriots what made Barack Obama so tedious it was all just about poking his opponents all just about dividing and dividing talking about why men should use the little girl's bathroom and painting the White House and rainbow colors of light right you know it's so just divisive writing off his countrymen as bitter clingers I mean listen to that I asked Tom I said are you calling half the country racist and he said no and then he called half the country racist that you know when you write off your countrymen as bitter clingers like Barack Obama did or Hillary Clinton writes them off is deplorable and irredeemable that that people don't like that don't that's not aspirational that's not inspired that's just ugly and bit crass and base and divisive and the good news for us is as long our political opponents on the Left keep that up I think things are gonna look up for us I mean there's a real aspirational quality to this presidency to this political moment bill kristol the erstwhile Republican commentator and conservative commentator he said the Reagan years were aspirational and Trump isn't he's missing it people are missing this this is an aspirational moment of coming together of succeeding of trying to bring North Korea to the table and we had a good first inning hopefully it goes all the way to the end this is a good moment and the left is relying strictly on smoke and mirrors it is all illusion and innuendo and smoke and mirrors and we it's best just to smack it down and to ignore it all right that's that's the rest of our show it's hard it's gonna be hard to beat that one tom is the lively personality but we won't be back tomorrow we have another great guest and then we've got some more more good stuff planned in the meantime I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show I'll see you tomorrow the Michael Nolt
