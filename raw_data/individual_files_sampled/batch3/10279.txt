a separate claim of Russian meddling a US government department recently sent a letter to tech giant's warning of Russian efforts to manipulate the energy market via social media Congress has a responsibility to bring transparency to social media when their content affects important matters of American public policy on October 23rd 2017 it was reported that Instagram a social media platform owned by Facebook was utilized by Russian antagonists to influence the u.s. energy market this recent revelation confirms the committee's suspicions Russia has exploited American social media platforms in an effort to influence the US energy market the letter was referring to alleged Russian support for u.s. activists campaigning against the North Dakota pipeline according to reports in the US media the Russian government used BOTS on Instagram to encourage Native Americans to defend their land against the controversial project in addition the US government has stepped up its sanctions on Russia's energy sector over Moscow's alleged interference in Ukraine the latest measures unveiled on Tuesday by the US Treasury put extra restrictions on firms working with Russian oil companies they focus specifically on deepwater Arctic and shale projects political writer Dan Glazebrook gave us his views on the story all of this this clampdown over Russian involvement social media sanctions in the oil industry it's all I would I would I would argue a primarily geopolitical rather than rather than solely economic well there is another aspect to this which is actually that the u.s. campaign or I would call it war economic warfare against Russia is also aimed at Europe as well it's aimed at Europe as well as aimed at damaging the relationship between Russia and Europe because the u.s. knows that any kind of Russian European rapprochement is potentially you know is it could be a challenge and a threat it's ongoing hegemony and global dominations but but I think really really that the major part of the economic war that's being waged against Russia is not so much the sanctions but actually the the oil price which was really manipulated by the Saudis who are who US and British proxies really manipulated by them some years back and that the primary victims of that have been Russia Iran and Venezuela
