people tend to hang out with people they like that usually means people with whom they share values and community and life experiences but now it appears that our political polarization has grown so wide that Americans who voted differently in 2016 don't want to hang out with each other that at least is the story from the Pew Research Center with regards to leftist that study found that 47% of Liberal Democrats stated that if a friend voted for Donald Trump it would strain the friendship for all Democrats it was 35% for Republicans that number was just 13% when applied to Hillary Clinton now maybe that number would have changed to filler aide one but there's more than a whiff of elemental scorn Democrats hold for Trump voters they don't see what was so bad about Hillary that would necessitate a vote for Trump they think a vote for Trump could never be made in a good-faith effort to help the country but it was rather just an endorsement of Trump's worst behavior this feeling combined with the fact that leftist living bubbles as Aaron Blake of the Washington Post points out 47% of people who voted for Clinton had zero Trump supporting friends that means the left will continue to polarize in Hillary only 28% of Democrats today say they aren't stressed by talking with those who differ on Trump which means the vast majority of Democrats won't even deign to discuss the issues that leads to West's knowledge of the typical Republican and the lazy intellectual construct that turns Trump voters into an other to be opposed on grounds of supposed bigotry that scorn will in turn drive more and more conservatives into Trump's arms much of the Trump movement was built on a reactionary and justified anger against leftist character assassination the West's solution unfortunately seems to be just more character assassination i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show so many things to talk about today I'm gonna get to a lot of Hollywood because I saw at Dunkirk last night and it is just a stunning film I want to talk about why it's so good I also want to show you a trailer that I think is legitimately one of the worst trailers with major stars ever made it's really spectacular ly bad and I loved it so much because it's so bad but before we get to any of that first I want to say thank you so our sponsor is over at Birch gold so if you are looking at the economy and you are seeing the political situation you feel that perhaps it is volatile perhaps we have a situation on our hands or maybe a situation will arise then it is important that you spend some of your money and put it in precious metals that's what Birch gold is for they will allow you to legally move your IRA or 401k out of stocks and bonds into a precious metals IRA that can help you get some of your money into the safe and secure asset that precious metals represent they have never been worth zero to get your no cost no obligation can go to birchgold.com slash pen that is birchgold.com slash bend and as I say according to basically thanks to IRS tax law you can move your 401k out of stocks and bonds and into precious metals Birch gold group has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau countless five-star reviews one of the people I would trust for investing in precious metals birchgold.com slash men they will send you a comprehensive 16 page kit showing how gold and silver can protect your savings so go and check them out let them know that we sent you okay so a lot of breaking news happening actually right now so the biggest breaking news literally broke about five minutes ago as were as we're filming this is that Sean Spicer the White House press secretary has now resigned telling President Trump he vehemently disagreed with the appointment of New York financier Anthony Skinner Moochie as communications director according to the New York Times mr. Trump offered mr. Skinner Moochie the job at 10:00 a.m. the president requested mr. Spicer stay on mr. Spicer told mr. Trump people lead the appointment was a major mistake according to a person with direct knowledge of the exchange so that's all we know at this point Anthony scary mood for people who don't know was actually a major Obama donor he ended up moving into the Republican camp after that I think that he was on the RNC committee did the Finance Committee in 2012 and then he was a supporter of a bunch of other candidates before he got to Trump he was a Scott Walker supporter and then his backer of Jeb Bush so he's much more sort of establishment Republican and he's being brought in apparently Steve Bannon was very unhappy with the choice of Anthony Skinner Moochie it looks like the ascendant wing of the of the Trump administration is the more establishment wing of the Trump administration meaning Anthony Ciara Moochie Gary Cohen who's a career Democrat is now being discussed as a cabinet member of new head of the Fed Reserve perhaps well according to NBC News comes is what Anthony does how he built his business the guy knows media he's been a good advocate for the president so I love this NBC News says another source said Spicer is definitely staying on well no now he's gone so it's amazing how you got all these conflicting reports out of the Trump administration I think the reason that secure Moochie is is considered kind of a nonentity or somebody who shouldn't have the job buy a lot of Trump supporters is because he wasn't on the Trump bandwagon from the beginning and therefore they think that he should not be allowed on the inner circle and this is one of the issues that Trump has had is trying to figure out who should be allowed to work with him who should he trust and there the people have been with him for a long time are upset that he seems not to trust them so much anymore so case in point be Jeff Sessions so yesterday Tucker Carlson came out and he was ripping up President Trump for ripping on Jeff Sessions as you recall we played you some of the New York Times interview yesterday in which in which Trump said that he would never have hired sessions if he knew that sessions was going to recuse himself Tucker Carlson and Ann Coulter both long time from supporters came forward and said listen stop messing with sessions sessions linearly as supporters he's one of the good guys on this team particularly with regard to immigration why are you ripping on your own base and there is a feeling that there's some confusion inside the Trump White House about staffing that is only being exacerbated by a new report yesterday from the Washington Post revealing that academic discussions have been ongoing at the White House regarding president Trump's pardon power apparently they're having lots of talks about what he can do with pardons can he preemptively pardon family members can he preemptively pardon himself with his really in the Washington Post Trump possessed advisors about his power to pardon aides family members and even himself in connection with the Russia probe according to one of those people a second person said Trump's lawyers have been discussing the president's pardoning powers among themselves you know I would imagine that at every point you have lawyers who are discussing and discussing the pardon power I'm not sure what they'd be discussing me exactly except for what is he capable of pardoning like if he pardons a crime now and the new evidence comes out later does the pardon cover that maybe there's a lot of talk this morning about if he would pardon himself would that actually be legal could he pardoned himself because president obviously has plenary pardon power he can do what he wants with pardons he can pardoned anybody right and Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon so you could have something like that but are you allowed to pardoned yourself that would not save his political career by the way if you pardon yourself the chances that you're going to be impeached are pretty high but none of this looks good okay if you're into the appearances of politics you can still believe that Trump has never done anything wrong that Trump is clean as the driven snow and that has nothing to hide but he needs to stop acting like you had something to hide if he actually wants to want you to believe that write the first paragraph of this Washington Post story says some president Trump's lawyers are exploring ways to limit or undercut Special Counsel Robert Muller's Russia investigation building a case against what they allege are his conflicts of interest and discussing the president's authority to grant pardons according to people familiar with the effort yesterday the spokesperson for his legal effort regarding the Russian investigation quit quit he also fired his lawyers and he hired new lawyers in the Russian investigation stuff so all of this doesn't look good I mean if your whole shtick here is let let all the doors be open let everything come out I'm draining the swamp see what I have been here in my apartment policemen just come in and investigate and then the next thing you do is immediately barricade three of the doors people are going to start getting a little bit suspicious and so you know do I think that this means that Trump is is guilty of anything no I mean there's there's alternative explanations that are just as plausible like for example maybe the reason he doesn't want Muller digging into his IRS records is because he is definitely afraid that Mulder is going to find that he's not worth anything like the wealth he said he was worth right so they weren't two billion bucks instead of ten billion bucks or maybe he's worked nothing right maybe it turns out that he's broke right you just don't know until you get those IRS records so maybe he's afraid of that maybe he's afraid that there's some sort of ancillary matter dealing with the IRS that he's going to be held accountable for and this is the problem with the Special Counsel investigations again the Special Counsel investigation was brought about because President Trump himself decided to open his big mouth he fired Comey and then he opened his big mouth on national television and said that he did it because of the Russia investigation that necessitated rod Rosenstein appointing a special counsel the biggest opponent Trump has here is not the biggest opponent Trump has here is Trump the media is getting its material from Trump he can hate the New York Times you can think the New York Times does to get Trump I think that they're out to get Trump I think they have an agenda but why is he giving a long interview with the New York Times in which he is talking about why he might fire robber Muller and why Jeff Sessions had should never have recused himself it's just foolish it's just foolish unless there's only two possibilities here right Trump his worst enemy is his big mouth he's doing things that look guilty because he just can't help himself because he has to talk all the time super plausible and the other answer is it's possible that he actually did something that makes him guilty and that's really bad stuff maybe he's doing all this for a reason maybe as the Democrat suggests he is actually guilty of something because if you look at it from the Democratic perspective let's do that for a second okay for people on the right I think it's important that both sides understand each other so on the Left understand no hard evidence of Trump Russia actual collusion has taken place there is intent to collude from Trump jr. right there's intense of collude from Manta for presumably there's intent to collude from Jared Kushner but there is no actual on-the-ground collusion no payoffs no quid pro quo you know so from the perspective left you need to understand we need more evidence in order for us to acknowledge that Trump actually did something illegal or even deeply wrong other than that meeting at this point and Trump wasn't in that meeting as far as we know from perspective of the left I think the right need to understand the perspective of the left here they're looking at this and what they see is a meeting between Trump jr. and a bunch of Russian lawyers would that was that was basically paved for that was paved with a promise they were going to give Trump negative information about Hillary as part of Russia's government governmental effort to support Trump and then you have Trump firing Mike Flynn for unspecified reasons after it comes out that Flynn has connections with Russia and then you have him firing his FBI director and saying openly that it's because of the Russian investigation and then you have him saying that he should have fired sessions who never hired sessions because sessions is recusing himself from the Russia investigation and then you have a series of policy decisions that benefit Russia including the decision this week by President Trump not to arm and fund Syrian rebels against Bashar Assad right which helps the Russian government so if you're on the web through looking at all these indicators and you're saying okay well you know I feel a lot of dots here it's hard for me not to connect them and if you're on the right you have to understand that perspective because we did the same thing President Obama right we were very suspicious of President Obama I think it's more justified with Obama than it is for Trump because I think that frankly Trump is more likely to make stupid mistakes and say dumb things then then Obama was I think Obama was much more of a president by design but I think that it's important we understand where we are so that we don't fall apart as a country because what I can foresee happening is some quasi smoking gun comes out and the right says it doesn't mean anything unless it means everything and we just grow further and further apart as a people and I think that's a mistake I think we we can disagree on the implications of these facts but we should at least acknowledge what the facts are and why maybe the other guy thinks what he thinks okay so with all of that said Trump care continues to remain controversial and I think here it's important to point out the radicalism of the left on on Trump care so nothing is happening with Trump care right now okay the repeal and replace effort is basically stalled because nobody knows they want to do we've talked about that for the past several days but the rhetoric of the left continues to ratchet up so for example yeah this professor because himself would be on say professor that's really what he calls himself the name is Kevin Allred and he's a adjunct part-time lecturer at Rutgers University which is a hell of a title he taught a class that are called politicizing Beyonce starting in 2010 because our institutions of higher education are the stupidest places on earth and and Kevin Allred tweeted the other day John McCain is pretty okay with taking away everyone's health care so excuse me if I don't have a well of sympathy for his brain cancer these are okay they're Democrats who believe this sort of stuff hey Bernie Sanders he says that he's not using violent rhetoric with regard to trump care but that's a lie here's Bernie Sanders doing it over and over and over again okay I want to talk about the rhetoric done senator because if you're going to sit down with people on both sides of the aisle some Democrats have branded Republicans the party of death for example calling the tax cuts in the Senate health care bills blood money you yourself except Republicans are potentially killing Americans is that rhetoric irresponsible and does it provide an impact to compromise if you're going to sit down with those very people that you've now said want to tell people no I never said that stuff you're using rhetoric that I didn't use is an ugly and cynical proposal this is a proposal which if adopted will result in thousands of Americans felt enormous pain and death the people all over this country we're taking away thousands of people who died of Americans robot okay so then that was protected by Reagan battalion obviously the Democratic rhetoric comment is over-the-top to the point where you're seeing people take it seriously and as you know I don't blame rhetoric for violence because I think that there's always a contingent of crazy people who are going to be triggered but you have to say that it if as I've explained this before if rhetoric is a circle and then crazy people are generally outside the circle as you broaden the circle of rhetoric to get more and more violence or closer and closer to violence you're going to end up triggering more and more people so those people who are outside the circle who wouldn't have been triggered by the rhetoric they are going to be now encompassed in a circle as the rhetoric gets more and more violent I'm not going to roughly blame Bernie Sanders for what happened yesterday in Nevada but it did have something but this sort of rhetoric does make things more polarized it does make things more volatile what I'm talking about of course is Las Vegas police released a video that has been non-covered I mean if this had happened to a Democrat would be covered all over the media you've not seen it anywhere right Las Vegas police released a video from surveillance cameras this is from senator Dean Heller office you can see this fellow standing outside the elevator over at Dean Heller's office he left a note threatening to kill Heller if he voted to repeal Obamacare right the note actually said that if that it said something like if you repeal Obamacare I'm going to die and I'm going to take you with me this sort of stuff is going to become more and more common as the Democrats continue to maintain that Republican policy murders people and so you have to understand on the left one of the reasons people are so defensive of Trump is because the left is so crazy if the left would stop with their craziness then people might stop defending Trump so ardently the reason that the right is defending Trump is because they feel like he's legitimately under threat sometimes violent threat from people on the left because of the rhetoric that's being used okay so before I go any further I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at the u.s. at concealed-carry Association so if you are deeply

because not only is it one of the first things that I remember as a kid I remember when they wheeled in the TV for the OJ verdict and I remember the the racial polarization in our class all the white kids kind of put their heads in their hand and all the black kids in the class started cheering when OJ was let off for obviously murdering his ex-wife and Ronald Goldman OJ had his parole hearing yesterday the reason that this is important is because this was I think the very beginning of the complete merger between politics and celebrity people watch the OJ trial as total entertainment to the point that now we can actually make a series about the OJ trial that's really entertaining the People vs OJ Simpson and it has huge ratings and Emmy nominations and it's really good but it but this merger of politics and entertainment it really was I think the beginning of the rise of the sort of reality TV star as political figure because Ronald Reagan was an actor but then he was the Governor of California before he ran for Oh Jay Simpson had been an NFL star and then he was an actor and some of the Naked Gun films and in the towering inferno in a bunch of movies and then he it mayn't commits this double homicide these two slayings and everybody in the world is watching this trial and treating it as entertainment when it really is not entertainment it's about whether a man murdered two human beings and the polarization that it brought off the reality TV polarization was shocking because remember this in the aftermath of the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles there's a widespread perception in the black community in LA at that time and I think still that the LAPD has race issues I don't think that's right now I think that there was some truth to it then and the fact is that a lot of black folks wanted to let OJ Simpson off the hook not because they actually thought that he was innocent but because he killed white people and they didn't really see why this shouldn't be a referendum on the LAPD as opposed to on Oh Jay Simpson the polls at the time showed a plurality of black people said that he was innocent it was obvious that he was guilty from the get-go and in too polarized that way that's a conflict that has never really cooled down we have the after-effects of it in Ferguson we have the after-effects of it over in over in Baltimore we have the after-effects of it every time the white cop shoots a black suspect or when a white non cop shoots a black person as in George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin in any case this is treated as sort of a joke yesterday and it was kind of a joke I mean OJ was convicted of armed robbery for stealing some of his own sports memorabilia in this is in 2008 he spent nine years in prison they had a 30 year sentence 33 year sentence but this is treated as a joke but it wasn't a joke at the time it was really polarizing period in American history and unfortunately in the last few years it seems to have come back again I want to show you sort of the insanity of this because if you didn't live through it it's almost impossible to to know how crazy the OJ trial was mean Mathis is fair bit younger than I am and I don't map to tells where you went to happen we're even alive why don't you happen when you already year-old it was 95 news to Samantha is so like I was I was 11 when this happened and this is a major earth-shaking incident if you didn't grow up with this though you don't understand what it meant when they cut in to the NBA Finals to show a white Bronco with OJ Simpson and it running down the free with AJ cowlings at the head and threatening to kill himself I mean it was legitimately insane time so OJ yesterday he goes to the parole board and everybody knows that the sentence that he got in 2008 was basically a giveaway for it was basically Karma for him murdering two people so he is it's the monster of the pack when he watched some of the testimony it's a monster over the fact that OJ was a very stupid man who obviously committed two murders and was used as a as a central rallying point for race baiters on all sides here is OJ yesterday explaining why he should be let out of prison well as I said the alternative to violence courses I've always thought I would I've been pretty good with people and I basically has spent a conflict-free life you know I I'm not a god had ever gotten two fights on the street and with the public and everybody but as that said they give you a bunch of little tools about how to talk to people instead of fight instead of the one punches tools that I've used here that you know it's how he talk to people tone that you use the victim empathy was once again I I didn't really see that okay he's led a conflict-free life if you believe that OJ Simpson has led a conflict-free life raise your hands not so fast Ron in a call that's just just amazing stuff and then he was led off yesterday and so you understand before this happened the parole board took a selfie with LJ so you knew how this was going to go before it even started and that shows you once again the merger between politics and and celebrity is really insipid and disgusting it's why you now have Caitlyn Jenner talking about running for Senate in California it's why Ashley Judd talked about running for Senate in Kentucky it's why Al Franken is in the Senate this is all part of the same general phenomenon that celebrity is celebrity and celebrity and political celebrity is the same kind as everything else Oh Jay was was granted parole even though his parole hearing was really went poorly I mean here's a clip of OJ trying to he's supposed to be admitting to his crimes right I mean is what you do in a parole hearing you admit to your crimes and then you say well I'm very sorry I did that and I'm never going to do it again here is the OJ talking about how he never did anything wrong they did an investigation and it came to the conclusion that with my property they turned it over to me I have it now you know so I mean it's kind of mine by a bottling that they turned over to me property that I'm in jail for for trying to retreat you know it was my property I would never steal from anybody and I would never ever pull a weapon on anybody well you believe that the property was yours you wouldn't put a weapon on anybody like really legally by the state of California that it was my property they've given it to me I sent it to me my question was why you went to them yes sir I was yours let me stop there are you with broll officers they're gonna clear him anyway because celebrity still has enormous currency I love that I would never pull a weapon on anybody again you chopped two people's heads off so I think that lacks a little bit of credibility in any case I want to go on to discuss what is the attempt by the Trump administration to move beyond the rush of stuff I also want to get into entertainment I want to spend a fair bit of time on the

Play we are on all of those things and you can subscribe and leave us a review we always appreciate it we are the largest conservative podcast in the nation all righty so uh so president Trump is trying to get beyond all the Trump Russia stuff it would help if he got out of his own way but he is doing some good things and I want to discuss a couple of the things that he is doing so here is there's a report out that over the first six months Trump promised that for every new regulation that he made he would cut to so far he is running circles around that according to James Baird over daily wire as soon as 16 regulations eliminated for every new one proposed so the idea that Trump hasn't done anything is not right I've said before that what Trump did was Gorsuch and cutting regulations that remains true the 16 to one ratio comes via numbers presented in a report this week from the Office of Management and Budget that shows the administration is holding true to its vow to be business friendly that's why you wonder why the stock market continues to go up even with all of the unease around president Trump's behavior the reason is because there's a general perception he's not going to do too much to hurt business and he's going to do a lot to help it by removing regulations in Obama's final year in office the Federal Register set the record for the highest page count ever at almost eighty-two thousand pages the administration is withdrawn remain inactive a total about 800 proposed regulations that were carryovers they've identified nearly 300 regulations related to energy production and Environmental Protection and plans to rescind review or delay across the EPA and the Interior and Energy Department this is a very good move by the Trump administration that is something that is worthy of pointing out and he deserves credit when he does things that are right so that is good also Mick Mulvaney was out there yesterday the director of the Office of Management and Budget and he is saying that it's time to push what he calls mag anomic s'right so make America great again na mcc's Kmag Anonymous is basically just conservative economics I mean like he's going to give you a list of talking points they're all the things we've been saying for years but now everything has to be put the hesitant to have the Trump brand on it listen I'm fine with that if Trump wants to put his brand on good things and then push them that's that's fine with me here's Mick Mulvaney discussing what they're going to do a tax reform oh I bet the politics obviously is the art of the possible I don't think we've given up on that Oh a possible corporate rate in fact I'd love to see a 15% rate I'd love to see less but the truth of matter is that we're still pushing for that lowest possible corporate rate we can't why you know the Democrats will to give away two big business it's not we're trying to get back to a healthy American economy we've defined that is three percent growth we introduced the term this week called mag anomic switch is sort of this unifying thing of every unifying theme of everything we're trying to do to get that healthy traditional American economy back on track and to have that you have to have a lot of capital investment you have to make people more productive and that means businesses need to invest more and that's what we're shooting for on tax reform okay well that's all good stuff and I hope to see president from pursue that in order to do that he's going to have to get out of his own way as we say you know Spicer is out scanner Moochie is in he's got a whole new set of lawyers on the Russia stuff he should put all that aside and he should stop talking to the press and you just pursue what it is that he wants to pursue I think one of the problems here is that he's not sure what he wants to pursue but hopefully he can consolidate around something so we get some good policy out of this administration okay so we're going to do some things I like and some things I hate they're almost combined today so we're going to do we're going to do things I like and things I hate before we get to that I first want to

okay time for some things I like and some things that I hate so things I like I saw this yesterday and I have to say this is the greatest trailer I have ever seen in my entire life it is a phenomenal phenomenal trailer it's Michael Fassbender and JK Simmons and rich and Rebecca Ferguson all these top line stars and it's basically a serial killer in Norway okay so they're trying to do girl with the dragon tattoo and it's really amazingly bad it's it's so bad this trailing and I love really like Michael Fassbender is an actor like I'll watch him in virtually anything I'll watch this with great enjoyment it's called the Snowman and it is so horrifying it's I'll play it then I'll explain why I love this so much it's like a parody a woman vanished last night we just found the body prints a man is missing the flopping fish she calls himself snowman hello mr. police does utterly insane I'm thinking that he's going off to women that he does the curse off the only thing we know for sure is that he's playing games with us yes okay so it's so great positive for a second suppose for one second I want to play more of it because it's so wonderful okay so first of all it's like they took every line from it from every silver color from that was the most cliched and it's like it's like serial killer mad libs like he's coated ly insane the only thing we know is he's playing games with us and then they took the least threatening thing on planet Earth a snowman right like the guy from like from frozen like the snowman and then they tried to make this into some sort of intimidating figure okay so it's not even like clowns which are creepy like an it okay you have a creepy clown in order you can make a creepy phone you can take something that's like a childhood thing but it has to be inherently a little bit creepy so clowns are a little bit creepy just inherently it's a person with a mask on that's a little bit creepy just to begin with but you can't take like Winnie the Pooh and make Winnie the Pooh scary there's just no way to do it right even if you're going to do Chucky and make Chucky scary it has to be like a deformed doll we're like a cut on its head like it has to be scary-looking okay this is not scary it's just a snowman and I'm like Hello mr. police like it's so great I love it so much and and I just love that Hollywood is making films that like they got top name cast because this is a best-selling novel because people have no taste whatsoever you know Dunkirk will probably open to 35 or 40 million dollars this weekend it is the best film of the year this will probably open to 35 or 40 million the weekend that it opens and it looks like it's going to be the worst film in history I need to play a little bit more of it just you can hear that every single line is a cliche I'm telling you it's a cliche Madeleine's it doesn't matter they took lines from like insomnia and then they took a line from from Silence of the Lambs they took a line from and then they took every serial killer movie they just took a random line from and stuck in and I have to play a little bit more because I can't stop watching this it's so addictive we need to wait I know I'm out be careful we don't know what we're dealing with yes we don't know what we're dealing with another snowman he's been watching at the whole time in watching that on that cutting things up into little pieces he's taunting us he's dancing and we don't find him this is never going to stop Thank You captain obvious another missing moment there's something we're not seeing there's nothing we're not being celebrate the way this has brought us together anyone can see that it's kind of hide something anyone can see that you're trying to hide something okay I can stop and start every single light so the only T everything in the entire trailer is like somebody with a mask on right that's why you don't use snowmen as your prop in a horror film the guys like really it's a snowman like I'm waiting to hear because it's summer like from frozen right it's gonna break into that this snowman killer oh so great so thank you michael fassbender for starting and what obviously is going to be the worst film in human history coming out in October I could not be more excited about this and I will buy 17 tickets so I will be one of the people making this four hundred million dollars for the box office I love it so much okay so now for a thing I actually really like and that is I talked Dunkirk last night I went to the premiere last night at at the ArcLight which meant I got a cool Dunkirk hat as well which is awesome but any case I will show you some of the trailer it is it is a unique war film it is not Saving Private Ryan it is not Band of Brothers I'm not a huge Saving Private Ryan fan I am a huge fan of brothers hand it is very very different film it is so creative and it is brilliant in in in a very different way here are some of the trailer the enemy tanks have stopped why my wrist pressures tanks when they can pick us off on the air like fish in a barrel there are 400,000 men on this Beach so it's really it's a gripping film but it's not gripping in the way that Saving Private Ryan opening scene is gripping where you just get non-stop violent and people's guts being blown out and the randomness of it what you get from this is something very different hidden Private Ryan is done in classical style it's sort of done like I always forget the name of the the film that was nominated last year orig what is it hacksaw wrench thank you I was mix it up with the Heartbreak Hill or whatever hamburger hill was the Clint Eastwood movie from the 70s I yeah but in any case is that film is he's done a very classical style so Saving Private Ryan you learn the backstory of the characters and then it takes you in narrative form through an entire you know an entire arc to a logical conclusion as to where this ends you don't get any of the characters backstories in this there's three main characters or three main stories that are followed one is called the mole the mole is a reference to this bridge that is it Dunkirk the problem with Dunkirk was that not where the British surrounded but they were on a beach where it was a bit very very shallow beach and the tide when it comes in it doesn't come in high enough for big boats to get in so destroyer couldn't get in and just pick up people instead they had to have small ships trying to figure things out and they didn't have any ships because the British were afraid that determines we're going to strafe the entire army and destroy all their ships as well as there as well as the army on the beach thereby destroying their capacity to resist and they also won't going to send all of their planes because they did that then those could all be shot down they wouldn't have the capacity to defend London so it's basically four hundred thousand guys stranded on this beach they can't escape and so it is the loneliest most quiet subtle war film I've ever seen left in lonely I mean like every shot looks like that shot of the four hundred thousand men standing and orderly queues on the beach as though they're waiting for ice cream but they're really waiting to know what they gonna live or die as they're being stripped from overhead when people die it's not done in like okay there's the in bandar brothers or Saving Private Ryan fat remembers like a leg over here it's actually done in almost classical fashion it's not a particularly bloody film you don't see people you know with their with their body parts torn off because it's not the point of the film like he just assumed that you know that war is going to be bloody but what he does do is he shows you almost the casual violence of war and he shows you the small actions by quiet people the whole point here is that most of it's amazing most people in America no longer even know somebody who serves the military presently there are about 2 million people who served active duty or certainly active duty in the in the military and there aren't all you know serving on various bases but there are lots of people who are in the National Guard and such especially in places like California and New York it's a good chat you will your entire life without meeting somebody who is an active-duty military member and so when you hear about a war what you think about a war is not somebody who you know it's just some disembodied person who is out there doing heroic things to try and save you and that's what this film takes on the reason you're supposed to care about these characters is not because you know where they went to high school and who they fell in love with like in like an axon Ridge it's not because you're you know their personal views on matters it's because these are people doing heroic things and making difficult choices and sometimes doing cowardly things and making terrible choices in the midst of in the midst of difficulty in order to survive to fight another day and fight Hitler every you make so many great directorial choices in this film one of them is that you never see the Nazis at any point in the film there's no point what you see the Nazis so the opening scene you do that right at the beginning of the trailer where they're all walking through the town of Dunkirk and they're there on the street and these Flyers are floating down saying you're surrounded that scene the very next thing that happens this isn't spoiling I think the first 30 seconds of the film the the they you just hear gunshots and they're stunningly loud so unlike most war films where they sound sort of just becomes overwhelming in this film every crack of a gunshot is stunning like it's startling it's legitimately will Trump in your seat because it's so loud and it's meant to do that because the idea is that every shot is equally it's equally possible that it's definitely I'm going to kill you and so they're walking down the street these five guys as you see there and in the first 30 seconds of the film you see you see them getting picked off one by one but you never see the Nazis at any point during this film you never see the Nazis the most you see the Nazis you see some lift off in planes that's it and so the idea here is that these guys are fighting an unseen force an enemy that they can't control an enemy they don't know and and yet they are having to make these really really difficult decisions so the three main stories are the one on the beach as I mentioned there was one by C so the sort of Dunkirk is that a bunch of civilian vessels were commandeered by the British military and civilians we're told to go sail across the 26-mile stretch to done kirk and pick guys up from the beach so civilians for non military members as men women just sailing across the english channel to pick up all of these members of the british military and an eight hundred eight hundred different boats did that almost a thousand boats did that and so it follows this this one mark violence and his son who are coming across to do that and you never really find out until the end why they're bothering to do it and and then the third story is tom hardy plays an RAF pilot Royal Air Force pilot who is um who's engaged in these dogfights and what's fascinating about the film is at the mole right what's happening on the beach takes a week what's happening with the with the sailor takes a day and what's happening with with Tom Hardy takes an hour and they say this upfront and how these stories meet up and are inter woven is really fascinating again the stylistic choice here is to focus on the actions of the men not on who the men are and I think that's and I think it's a deliberate combined no one so some people have found that off-putting people it said that they don't feel emotionally invested in the characters because they're not being given the backstory they're not being given this whole thing but that's the point okay you don't have to be emotionally invested in who the soldiers are who defend civilization in order for you to be emotionally invested in their fight for survival and their fight for victory that's the entire point of the film and it really is it's really a first-rate film it's one of those films where I walked out of it and it's kind of stunning it's one of it's more of an experience than it is a film and you walk out and you feel like you'd experience something you should go see an IMAX if you can I saw I didn't see an iMac mm 70 millimeter and it's just it's first-rate and the more you think about it the better it gets the more you realize the kind of directorial choices he's making whether so good okay so time for a quick thing I hate and then we'll get to the mailbag so the thing I hate time so JZ has been rapping about his infidelity and monica lewinsky loves it this is really a thing okay so according to the Daily Mail Monica Lewinsky has now praised jay-z for speaking openly about cheating on his wife Beyonce on his way to stab him mullinski who understands better than anyone the public cost paid for a high-profile affair spoke about the iconic rapper's transgressions in an essay published by Vanity Fair in the piece titled jay-z Prince Harry Brad Pitt and the new frontiers of male vulnerability the former White House intern praised hub for not ignoring the allegations hurled to him by Beyonce on her 2016 album lemonade jay-z had a choice mineski wrote having been called out publicly by his wife in her fierce 2016 album and video he knew his fans wouldn't have blinked his next album skim past the allegations that's not uncommon for men to do and it's not as if we hadn't seen Beyonce and jay-z out of the world together since then not to mention welcoming their twins to Planet Earth jay-z could have ignored it all but instead he chose a path of candor that will move the conversation forward and help others know just know okay if Beyonce wanted to stay together with her husband then she shouldn't have been talking about his infidelities publicly and if he wanted to stay together with her not only should you not be committing infidelities he shouldn't be out there talking about his infidelities publicly because it's not a marriage in my opinion that is going to end well because marriages where the partners talk about cheating on each other openly is that that's not bound to go particularly well it's scuzzy behavior and some behavior can stay private okay what happens between universe actually one of the one of the weirder aspects of human nature is you'll see a husband cheats on his wife and he feels the necessity to tell her there's nothing more selfish than doing that okay it's super selfish to commit infidelity in the first place and then to tell your spouse about it is even more selfish because that's about you alleviating your guilt not about you making your spouse's life better in any way it's about you know creating a choice for your spouse that is that your spouse never would have had to make except for you being an idiot and feeling the need to jump off your own guilt on your spouse so in when they said that honesty is the best policy in these sorts of things no being good is the best policy and then if you do something guilty live with your guilt don't dump it off onto other people the idea that we need a society filled with people who are publicly proclaiming their infidelity is is really a bad idea okay time for some mailbag let's do it so Josh Mayer's has been you discussing that neutrality where you get thoughts on the matter in your ideal outcome capitalism fix it or leave the government policies in place so I am not in favor of net neutrality net neutrality as you'll see is B it's very funny a lot of the people who say the net neutrality is basically a giant giveaway run to companies that are ISPs Internet service providers then you've got to mention that net neutrality that the net neutrality itself is a giant giveaway to places like Google and Netflix right there there certain companies they eat up all the bandwidth on the internet and net neutrality forces internet service providers to charge them the same amount for data as it would charge to anybody else as opposed to surcharging them for all of this okay Internet service providers get to compete with each other that would be the idea the problem that we've had with internet service providers is that there are local monopolies that ensure that there are only two or three at the most companies Internet service providers they're actually in a particular area so you're using a regulatory fix to fix a regulatory problem well you really should do is relieve all the regulations on internet service providers in general allowing people to build new infrastructure and then compete in the open market with one another because there'll be some ISPs the charge net puts more and some of the charge them less there will be some ISPs that charge small providers less and let them compete and that competition will ensure a better internet plus I mean the internet seems to be working pretty fine as it is I don't understand the huge issues that people are having with with the internet that they think it needs to be fixed by some sort of overarching government system nick says urban which state is your least favorite and since we're on the topic of California why do you live there it seems like a hellhole so California is a beautiful place that is governed by crap it's I lived there my entire life the weather is really nice most of the time there is some culture here despite all the talk about black there of which state is my least favorite it's hard to say state I can tell you cities that I really don't like so I'm not a big fan of New York City New York City it's fun to visit I would hate to live there I like seeing the sky I'm a suburban guy I grew up in the suburbs so hard for me to live in New York but the state of New York is great I mean go to upstate New York is beautiful there are real areas of New York that are just just wonderful Michael says hi Ben I recently watched a video by Jordan Peterson regarding job suitability for different IQ levels he raises the point that society never really addresses what to do with people of low average intelligence regarding jobs what are your societal prescriptions for those people in the workforce since constant mechanization is leading to demand for more and more skilled workers thanks I mean this is actually a really really good question so this I think is the big question of the future of the workforce the truth is machines are good at doing some manual labor but they're not going to doing all manual labor so machines aren't good at varying very specialized manual labor like at factories right if it's doing one thing over and over and over machines are really good at that what machines are not really good at is doing many different tasks so for example you can have a Roomba that cleans your floor but it's not gonna be able to clean your table right so if you a person can do both of those things so manual labor is not going to go totally out of style for people who are not you know Phi Beta Kappa and actually need to work in manual labor but yes we are going to have to develop skill sets as mechanization creates less need for manual labor there is going to be a need for more creativity in the market the good news is that IQ doesn't always match up with creativity so there's a lot of people who are very creative who aren't necessarily world's brightest people just look at Hollywood so we're all going to have to up our skill sets a little bit I don't think the market has ruled out you know low IQ people at this point when it starts to then we are going to if we get to the point I've said this before if we get to the point where machines are basically providing such abundance that everybody is there's no need for the there's no need for markets because markets are created by scarcity if you have the replicator from Star Trek and it just creates everything you could ever need then you don't have to worry about things being created anymore and then you talk about a universal basic income Tyler says why is it when a person from Western country converts to an Eastern religion they are considered enlightened when a person from an Eastern country converts to Judaism or Christianity they are traded to their culture this is a very good question the answer is because there is always a bias against the religion with which you grew up in Western civilization if you grew up in an area where everybody's conservative than you become lefty then you are considered a lightened member of the upper class by people in the big cities and the same thing is true with regard to religion you are you're moving beyond your boundaries never mind that if a person from the east converts to Judaism or Christianity they are considered a heretic very often or they're considered a rube that's just because we as a society have learned to hate ourselves in a lot of ways Evan says in what circumstance do socks go with sandals so as someone who used to wear socks with sandals and found it extraordinarily comfortable when I was a teenager I will say in situations in which are not publicly seen that would be that would be the proper answer because I got to tell you I'm not a big sandals fan in general particularly for dudes right dudes should not wear sandals because feet are ugly so like dude feet not something people want to say put on some shoes that like it just looks smelly and terrible like please don't do that okay Chris says last year Ted Cruz voted against bills to increase veterans benefits and it hurt his standing among us is it intellectually dishonest to say the veterans is a group deserve entitlements due to the nature of their service as opposed to other groups so I am not aware of Ted Cruz's votes on veterans benefits I'd have to look that up to confirm whether that is in fact true but the general question to say that veterans deserve entitlements due to the nature of their service no I don't think that's out of bounds at all I think that's part of the contracts when they sign up right it's your telling them to go do the most violent difficult job on planet Earth in many cases and you're going to have to pay people a lot of money for that including lifetime benefits in some cases it Kyle says hey Ben how did you know you're ready for kids what advice would you give to a young couple out of college as to how to know when they are ready for kids so two things one you're never truly ready for kids okay kids are you can make the decision that you think that you are financially prepared to take care of a child that's really what it was for us we were in a financial position where we were ready for kids and we felt that we had the time and resources to properly care for our children so from a logical perspective that's true but when people say ready for kids the implication is I'm not ready for kids and I should just not have a kid and in fact is the most kids who are born are not prepared for last should you should you prepare if you can yes you should make sure that your relationship with your spouse is over rock solid because the having kids changes the nature of your relationship with your spouse before you could focus only on the other person in your marriage and now you both have to focus on these new people who take over your lives so you better be solid before that happens so if you're financially you know on the upswing and if you are and if you are solid with your spouse and you can safely say you're ready for kids but if you're not ready for kids that doesn't mean that you can't be a good parent or that you can't become ready for kids or that it can't help you grow as a human being and that you take responsibility for decisions that you make that says hey Ben my little sister is 13 she like most kids is very caught up in today's culture on politics because their idols tend to be liberal she's been developing a more liberal view of the world ERD tends to look at conservatives in a bad light I was wondering if you had any advice on how I could go about helping her understand services and better without alienating her I'd appreciate it so I think the first thing to say is that you know it's it's not good to label people you don't know as bigots without any sort of evidence that they are bigots okay you're tolerant of all sorts of views if you consider yourself a liberal you probably aren't conservative because if you consider yourself liberal it's because you want everybody be able to do what they want basically at the libertarian position not a leftist position okay leftist like to say that about sexual matters the right doesn't really even care about that stuff anymore okay libertarians don't even care about that stuff if I care about it on a religious level I certainly don't care about it on a governmental level or on a public policy level so you know I think that she probably has a skewed view of what the right is because she's listening to people from the left the answer should be go listen to some people from the right and that way maybe you can determine whether what is being said about those people is true or not Alec says what is your position on mandatory tipping I think the original tradition of giving a tip in advance for better service made sense everybody demands it tip for everything regardless of the level of service so I am a pretty generous tipper I am ideological ideologically opposed to tipping so I both of these things are true I am generous tipper because I think when people work hard they deserve money and I'm happy to give them that money however tipping is stupid okay I'm with Dwight Schrute from the office on this one I don't hit my proctologist and he's doing something more important than carrying my food seven feet from the counter to my table so this idea that you get a special tip because you carry food 7 feet like how about this I would rather you make a better wage and charge me more for the food then that I have to decide whether I'm a good person or not based on the tip I give that's a I mean that really is what we do right they've actually found this they've done studies of this of tipping it's really fascinating and what they found is they thought that originally people did tipping because it was reciprocal altruism that if you give a tip somebody's gonna give you a tip back but then they found that that makes no sense right you never see the way to regret you never see these people again it's just that you don't want to be perceived by that waiter as a bad guy so you give a tip so there's a moral judgement that's made about you based on the level of your tip and you're making a moral judgment about your waiter based on you know did they do a good job in are they a bad person I'm gonna give you a $2.00 tip just to show you and my grandfather used to do this we didn't like the service you believe in nickel right just to show them they didn't like the service again I don't think that any of this is relevant we all earn wages out here in the in the non tipping world so I'm not a huge fan of although I will say that I think that if you're an employee it's a great way to make some extra money it's really what it is is it's almost become a way to avoid taxes because tips are generally given in cash and if you're a waiter you can make a lot of money on the side that way okay david says hey Ben I was a fellow Game of Thrones fan sometimes I have an issue with the over-the-top sex and violence is there a way you justify the graphic nature of the show are we just huge nerds who are willing to accept it so both yes the over-the-top sex and violence is over-the-top sex and violence over-the-top violence doesn't bother me very much because I think that there are situations in which violence is is necessary so the over-the-top violence and Band of Brothers doesn't bother me really because I think there are situations in which violence is necessary and violence against evil is necessary and we should all see the wages of sin are death and we should all see that that you know bad things even happen to good people but when it comes to the graphic sex in the first season for example and it is very graphic the first season is basically near pornographic I had problems with that I fast-forwarded through a lot of that because I thought that it was just HBO's in what HBO does every HBO show just to prove that their HBO and they're there pay access they have some boobies just to show oh look we're HBO and we can put boobies on TV and now they've decided up the ante and so oh we're HBO so we can put a dinghy on TV you know this is this is what they do so I don't know as a way to justify it I think that you can take over all the shows great I think you can fast-forward those things I think that but I'm not going to justify what I think are bad artistic choices there are situations in which nudity on screen is is is actually useful to the story so I think of two cases in particular of Clockwork Orange where there's some nudity on screen but it's directly designed to demonstrate the the evil and vulgarity of the villains and and their inability and and and what the brainwashing program has done to this one guy afterward and there's another movie called the pawnbroker and I think I've recommended on the show before with Rod Steiger about a Holocaust survivor and there's one scene where he runs a pawn shop and a woman comes in and she bares her breasts in front of him and it's used as a gateway for a flashback to his wife was in a concentration camp with him and she's being raped by a Nazi officer so there there there you have a case for both those cases typically are not erotic right both of those cases are rape scenes so I think in rape scenes very often you have to show that stuff in order to show how vile and evil rape is and why rape they should be castrated or kill to the most evil people on earth but in terms of like erotica you know showing erotic stuff on screen I don't think that's hardly ever necessary in fact the most romantic scenes of all time are rarely sexing those are you the most forgettable right the romantic scenes are the ones that are from the 1940s where you know people barely touch in the tension is just tremendous that's the most romance and sexual tension not sexual release and it seems that most of today's movies focus in on sexual release not sexual tension okay so we will be back here next week next week I will be traveling to Washington DC to testify before Congress and we'll give you all the updates on Berkeley as of Monday right now Berkeley is saying that they are going to try and give me a slot they pledge that they will make the event happen so thank you for all of your support folks and hopefully they'll fulfill that pledge we'll see they kind of jerked and Coulter around so we'll see if they jerk me around as well but hopefully they'll keep their pledge we'll give you the update I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
