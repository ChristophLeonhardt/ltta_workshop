yesterday's attempted walk back of his comments standing next to Vladimir Putin is not the first time we've seen president Trump in damage control mode take his explanation for not rejecting the support of David Duke in the KKK will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don't want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election well just so you understand I don't know anything about David Duke okay okay I mean I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here but I don't know honestly I don't know David Duke he says I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here and you said honestly I don't know David okay so let me tell you I'm sitting in a house in Florida with a very bad ear piece that they gave me and you could hardly hear what he was saying except he repeated David Dukes name and his answer to Jake Tapper or the president's 360 on who deserved blame in Charlottesville we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence on many sides on many sides as I said on Saturday we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence it has no place in America you had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent and nobody wants to say that but I'll say it right now I think this blame on both sides but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides I only tell you this there are two sides to a story that was last summer after Charlottesville then we talked about how he waited and reportedly tested the waters before reacting to his reported s whole country's comment president Trump slams immigrants from and these are his words asshole countries and here's the thing the White House is not denying it according to our White House Correspondents quote to sources close to the administration told NBC News Trump worked the phones Thursday night calling friends and allies outside the White House to gauge reaction to fallout from the blank hole comments one source characterized Trump as seeking reassurance another source told NBC News the president sought insight about how the episode might resonate among his base of supporters 15 hours after the Washington Post published a story trumps now denying then he used those words joining us now is the co-founder of Axios Mike Allen this morning Axios is looking at how Republicans are reacting to president Trump's cleanup efforts Mike good morning always good to see you what am i so we look at Charlottesville the president's cleanup included the term on both sides and yesterday as he said yes I agree with my intelligence services that Russia meddled in the 2016 election going out on a win there then the ad-lib was could be other people a lot of people other people out there he never gives you a clean explanation or a clean apology or a clean clarification for what he meant no of course not because he doesn't believe it right and you see this behind the scenes of the staff agrees on what they're gonna say and he goes out and it's his way of rebelling it's his way of saying I'm doing this because I have to but I'm gonna take it back and I can tell you lawmakers that we talk to you not a single one of them believes that he said would when he meant wouldn't and behind the scenes they will tell you his comments aren't fathomable they're unexplainable they're an American but as we seem like they won't go on-screen to say it then when people saying it people leaving the stage we should believe him the first time it's what you're saying leave what he says the first time because it's what he actually thinks know where he's forced to walk it back that's right so much so I'm like what's the cumulative effect of this not only in terms of his staff the folks who are around it but the cumulative effect of the kind of repeated lying the repeated walk back for for American democracy generally what do you think is that is the effect of all of it well yeah that's that's distortion forcefield the barnacle was talking about at the top of the show that you get Republican lawmakers who come out and they will barely say that they disagree or say the least that they have to and we learned that the reason that he went out and did this turn around clean up was that they were worried they're being a little bit more from the hill that some of the people had started to speak up just after they did after Charlotte's fell they said there could be more of that so his sole audience yesterday was the hill that's why he took it back and that's why when we see his tweets this morning he doesn't believe it so Kristen Soltis Anderson let's just talk about this what we saw yesterday as a communication strategy of Bill Cheyne new to the to his position in the communication shop formerly of Fox News and it seems to be they got in a room together and they decided here's how we're gonna explain this one after 24 hours of saying nothing and it's going to be that you've misspoke on one word and that you were misunderstood that you didn't conjugate a verb the way you meant to conjugate a verb is that really the best they can do and is that really what the White House thought would convince the American public that yes the president the United States does believe that Putin is a bad guy who meddle in our election well there's a slice of trump's base that no matter what the explanation had been would have agreed with it would have bought it would have said great he's put this matter to bed I think the air is another slice of people they were trying to speak to which are those who believe that Trump is prone to miss speaking that's not a hard thing to believe right so in a way they're trying to lean into a belief that already exists out there among people both who like and dislike the president which is that he is sometimes prone to saying things that are not quite the eloquent way you'd want to say them and because even those who really oppose the president are willing to believe that I suspect that's why they thought this was the best communication strategy lean into something people already believe about the president to try to make them believe something that is frankly hard to believe and now we're seeing already today the president is tweeting again saying the media kind of pushed me into this they wanted to see a boxing match he's also tweeting about NATO just a few moments ago he tweeted this while the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace the meeting with Russia may prove to be in the long run an even greater success many positive things come out of that meeting Russia has agreed to help with North Korea where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along there is no rush the sanctions remain big benefits an exciting future for North Korea at the end of the process who you hop scotch from NATO to Russia to North Korea there Steve Rattner you've got some charts with you first of all let's fact check because going back to what we heard him say to Tucker Carlson last night about NATO countries in the 44 billion dollar number he's touting that he delivered he just keeps making this stuff up so he's been saying this repeatedly since the summit and the best evidence that I can give you as to why it's not true is what McCraw France that immediately after Trump said it and I wrote the words down he said the communique is clear it reaffirms our - a commitment to 2% in 2024 that is all and then with respect to Trump's claim that the US bears the vast burden of NATO he contends he confuses what countries spend on defense themselves versus what NATO spends we only contribute 22% of NATO's actual budget he says it's 1991 where he gets that number is a mystery so to be clear Steve what he got a pledge from NATO countries as he left Brussels to live up to their 2% commitment not to pay more than they'd already pledged to pay he got a pledge for them to do what they already said they were going to do so if you want to call that a pledge you can call that a pledge all right so what are we looking at in your toes look I propose that it seemed like a good day to talk about Trump's lies in general and we had some very good help from the folks at the Toronto Star and I want to get these numbers right who went through all 1 million three hundred forty thousand three hundred words that Trump has spoken or tweeted since his inauguration and they've had some fun I assume those computer computer help here and they found 1929 false statements involving 68 thousand nine hundred twenty eight words but what's interesting about it as you can see in the truck that's on the screen now is if you track the trend of what he's saying and this goes week by week and those light gray bars in the back or how many false claims were lies he said each week but the most interesting line is the red line that goes across the middle that shows the trend in what he's been saying and so at the beginning of his administration he was sort of in the eighth lies per week category down here and today 18 months into his administration he's in the 40 lives per category here and that of course you can see that the last few weeks have been a little tough for him so he's been lying lying even more so Steve can I just ask are these based on on figures he stated as fact that weren't fact because he also says things like he said in one of these tweets it's an acknowledged fact that Brussels went well I mean that's not nice yeah I don't think he's cat and in fact the Toronto Star's reasonably conservative the Washington Post has done a similar analysis and they actually got to 3,000 to 3,250 1 lies so I think this is a pretty tight group of lies now you may say well the number of lies is rising because he's talking more so you talk more you lie more however if you compare the amount of wise to have much he talks you see that the number of lies per word is also also going up and so at the beginning of his term about again let's focus on the red line about 2 percent of his words were part of a lie and by the end of June he was up date and a half percent of his words were part of a lie and so he is lying more and more even as he talks more and more the proportion of lies is still is still going up and then lastly we can look at we can look at where these lies are occurring and so you can start with speeches 648 speeches now you may say well speeches are written out so how can there be lies in there so either they're not fact checked or this is extemporaneous stuff that he's that he's throwing in there and then the other thing I thought was interesting with the interviews so he's only given about 60 interviews half of those are with Fox and he's lied an average of 6 and a half times per interview so nick capo stories as you look at these numbers it's almost hard to compete in 15 percent of his words and all the rest of it but you know he repeats a lot of them to which is extraordinary I'm thinking again about his line that he was the first Republican to win the state of Wisconsin ignoring Ronald Reagan of course in 84 saying Reagan only lost Wisconsin he knows it's false he says it again and says it again you know the fact that we can even have this segment right the fact that we can even do a statistical analysis by a week of how often he lies is a terrible and tragic commentary on the presidency and I I can't even have fun with it it's it's it's it's terrible and when I think about if you compound that with the fact that his distortion bubbles might calls it drags everyone in his party along with it you have a recipe for a real crack-up in American politics he is moving them off a commitment to facts but he's also moving them off their own policies he's gonna have people saying collusion is actually fine if mother comes out in six months and says that there's actually a conspiracy there gonna be people in bars in Pennsylvania saying well you know what it's not so bad you know you know you know a Clinton was really bad it was worth beating her he is gonna pull everything in that direction this is entirely consistent with what we know about human behavior which is that with any kind of habit or addiction if it isn't addressed if it isn't called out is if it isn't treated it gets worse it's like that with adults it's like that with children and there's no one calling him out other than the media who he feels he's already handily discredited and we've seen you know the point of that walk back right as Mike put it was to give members of Congress in his party just a fig leaf to say you know what it's over and we saw that yesterday people like Bob Portman senator Portman came out and said you know what I take him at his word him case closed that was the only purpose to that it wasn't for the public it wasn't for us it was for Congress and it worked and it's not just that he gets away with it he's rewarded for it that's why you see this behavior going up boy because hold on his party doesn't change his hold on his bass and the people out in any place where there's a race doesn't change it so that's why you see this and there's no one around him who can say you just can't say that or and the reason that we see those hats like there isn't anyone around him who can say like this is the speech we're gonna stick to it he goes up they can have something in the prompter but he goes out and says what he wants to and a real change that we've noticed in the last few few months they don't even try to explain anymore the staff just says it's Trump and you ask him what what he's gonna do when they say no and his argument kristin is this is how I got elected Trump being Trump and it seems he's convinced many of his handlers and his aides that that's the best way to go well and I think the reason another reason that we haven't talked about quite yet that folks on Capitol Hill have not been as vocal about pushing back against all of these times when the president says something that is provably false is because I think there are a lot of Republicans on the hill that may disagree with the president on trade they may be horrified with where he stands on Russia all of these positions the president takes that are very far outside the bounds of traditional Republican orthodoxy they want to be able to hopefully try to influence this president they view someone like a Jeff Flake or a bob corker is no longer having the opportunity to speak to the president and say mr. president you've got it wrong on trade mr. president you've got it wrong on Russia where if they stay silent if they say fine I take him at his word let's move on they preserve that ability I believe they think they preserve that ability to be able to go to the White House and say mr. president I think you should do this differently to be able to contact him privately or what have you so I think that's another important thing to bear in mind I think they just not only politically don't view it as beneficial to them to criticize the president because it's not gonna change voters minds but I think they want to preserve the ability to try to change Trump's mind even if that has not proven terribly successful in the people they've tried it I'm thinking about the case of tariffs they've all gone on the record say how bad tariffs are well the president goes through this tariffs anyway because in his gut he believes they're right Kristin Soltis Anderson thank you very much Mike Allen thank
