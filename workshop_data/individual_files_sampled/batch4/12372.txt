the hypocritical left and the excitable right are both losing their minds over president drums successful order to attack Syria on Friday we will analyze the case for the strikes how bombing the Middle East is an American tradition and why everybody should just keep calm and cough FA then despite the constant negative press Trump's approval rating tops 50% and finally on this day in history the inauguration of George Washington I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show so much to get to today before we get to bombing the Middle East before we get to talking about bombing

Middle East is an American tradition there is nothing new about this for those of you who are not history buffs here is some I think archival footage of a joint CIA military intervention in the Middle East in 2004 come on Gary act you have the power Derk Derk allah Derka Derka Muhammad jihad poppy Sherpa Sherpa Bakala o durka durka durka it was tap cotton it's amazing footage I think we got that from WikiLeaks and it's it's pretty incredible that you know the government tries to obviously cover some of those things up but really harrowing footage from another intervention in the Middle East here is president Trump announcing the strikes on Syria the purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production spread and use of chemical weapons that's the limited strike that's what it's about there's it's not an all-out war it's not a ground invasion it's about going in and deterring the use of chemical weapons which are prohibited by about a gazillion international treaties and the policy of the United States so there were reports that defense secretary mattis convinced Donald Trump not to take a more robust action here president Trump has given different signals on how he wants to approach the military what basically happened is we sent powerful missile attacks against three targets aimed at stopping the Syrian regime from using chemical weapons and to deter Bashar al-assad from using those weapons again this was the most conservative proposal it could have gone a lot further than this we could have bombed more chemical weapons research facilities we could have bombed all over the country we could have hit military command centers we even could have hit Russian air defenses in Syria which would have seriously struck a blow against Syria's military could have really depleted that military force but President Trump used a lot of caution here and he did basically the most conservative action he could have done while still being somewhat effective apparently mattis these are just reports that are coming out so who knows if the leaks are true but Madison's restraint because also we don't want to provoke Iran and Russia into escalating this conflict we don't want to get bogged down in a major war also we cannot tolerate the use of chemical weapons some people have suggested that Syria doesn't use chemical weapons in these attacks that really the chemical weapons are being used by other other forces forces that are opposing the Assad government this is a very complex war that's multilateral there are a lot of different sides fighting for different things here we should at least dispel with the absurd notion that Syria the Syrian government doesn't use chemical weapons we know that they use Chemical Weapons we know that they have lied about using chemical weapons we know that they have lied about using chemical weapons because they admitted to having chemical weapons in 2013 and at other times even after they denied having them in the first place so you can't trust the Syrian regime that the guy is a butcher and his father was a butcher too what's interesting here too is the National Security Adviser so John Bolton is the relatively newly minted national security adviser this is one of his first actions here and he's clearly changed his thinking in some ways on Syria or he's allowing other forces in the room to have more of a say early on in his tenure at that job or Donald Trump just wanted to send a message to Syria you know John Bolton had said that Syria is a sideshow that the real threat is Iran and most serious thinkers on foreign policy and the Middle East recognize that Iran is the threat in the region and so that plays a little bit into the calculation here because Iran is exerting a lot of influence on Syria we also have a geopolitical adversary in Russia and Russia is exerting a lot of influence on Syria so you have to calibrate a response to that effect there are provocations here do you remember when Barack Obama said if there's a use of chemical weapons that would be a red line the minute he said that he had to justify that threat except he didn't because he was weak because he just ran him out all the time and didn't actually back it up with action the credibility of the United States is very important here and that demands a response bad actors all around the world are always trying to provoke the United States to push the boundaries China does it North Korea does it Syria does it Russia does it every every one of our geopolitical foes does this and you have to respond it's like a little kid with daddy you know and the little kid you know starts eating all the cookies out of the cookie jar and if the dad doesn't punish him what's he gonna do is going to eat more cookies or he's drawing all over the wall it's just pushing boundaries to see how far can I go how far can I go and we have to smack them down this will get to an important aspect of what I think should become the Trump doctrine and American foreign policy in the 21st century but we'll get to that in a bit to get to compliment Donald Trump even more this was good diplomacy he got the British and the French in line here this was a coordinated effort between two of our biggest allies I'll try to refrain from making French military jokes because they helped us out in this action but you know those those abounds there are a lot of jokes about the military and waving things like that this all seems reasonable enough here is how some of trumps allies on the right have responded to these strikes and now you got Madison in all these peoples all over us and the damn liberal fascist not censoring us everywhere in the last two days we did an emergency 36 hour broadcast trying to stop this it can leave the World War three and youth several pieces off Oh support this you you damn degenerate you call me you every major analysts say right now every analyst agrees this could trigger World War three unlike anything in our history and the Russians were the good guys battling Isis al Qaeda I'm not a Russo file I've never been to Russia but I've studied the geopolitics they are the white knights and our military five years ago joining the russians to block Obama and the Arab Spring does the right thing did the right thing and now mattis and mattis looks like a Emperor Palpatine cut it cut it there I think that's enough I think we actually bleeped out more of that clip than we heard I think the majority gotta love Alex Jones I really I find the guy very entertaining I do like watching him you not pleased he was not pleased how do you really feel Alex what do you really think about those strikes so by the way he said that this is gonna cause World War 3 and he tweeted this out he said World War three has just begun World War three and you hear this from these guys who are prone to hysteria on the radio and on TV so I weeded out I said this was on Friday or Saturday I said Alex I bet you $10,000 this isn't World War three D and he didn't respond I said you take the bet and he didn't respond because I was thinking you know I've got a pretty good track record on political bets as my framed Ben Shapiro checker for their shows so I was thinking I could make a cool 10k and pay for you know at least two days of drinks on my honeymoon or something but unfortunately didn't take the bet because I don't know if he really believes any of that we have to get to his assertion that the Russians are the good guys here we'll get to that in a second before we get to that let's talk about Lending Club let's talk about money this it perfect timing because as you know I need a little bit of money for my honeymoon over here the blank book money

guys here we should just pause for a moment to analyze the serious strikes in light of the Russia collusion narrative which even ban Jones admitted is an absolute nothing burger but the left is still insistent on their still insistent than Donald Trump a man that we've known for forty years is secretly Boris from rocky and bullwinkle he's a Manchurian Candidate from Moscow let's just analyze so in just recent days Donald Trump has expelled sixty Russian diplomats he did that in March this was a major hostility and he said it's brought our relations with Russia to the worst point including the Cold War might be slightly hyperbolic but pretty bad he slapped a bunch of sanctions on Russia and he's moving to institute more and now we are literally bombing Russian backed forces in Syria will this final Democrats all the Democrats watching this show will this finally put an end to the rush of collusion narrative I know the answer to that go I know it won't of course it won't because what they're gonna say is they're gonna say well Donald Trump you know if he really wanted to hide the fact that he's colluding with Russia you know what he would he would place sanctions on Russia and he would really he would expel diplomats and he would bomb Russia so that we wouldn't know that he secretly loves Russian he's helping Russia ah we've got him that's what they're gonna say but it's absolutely ridiculous just say they're the good guys here is absurd I you know we can work with Russia when we can work with Russia they've been our geopolitical adversary for a hundred years that didn't just stop when the Berlin Wall came down we know that they try to interfere in our politics we try to interfere in their expansionist ideas too and that's perfectly well and good but we shouldn't pretend that they're our buddies or something and they really have the best interests of the u.s. at heart did they swing the 2016 election no do some Twitter accounts and some Facebook ads really matter to American politics absolutely not or they're greater threats in in many areas absolutely true but they're not like our BFF man that's a little too much so to the issue at hand president Trump bombed the middle this is a rite of passage this is a rite of passage for American presidents in 1998 I remember this I was eight years old and we were bombing Iraq Bill Clinton decided to bomb Iraq and I asked my mother I said are we going to war in Iraq why are we fighting Iraq why are we bombing Iraq and she said she explained foreign policy to me this is one of the best explanations I've ever heard which was Oh Michael you know it's an American pastime it's it's an American tradition and it's Bill Clinton's turn also he wants to clear the newspapers out of his other stories which is true is at the time all you could see on TV was Lewinsky and he bombed Iraq and it got Lewinsky out of the headlines for a little bit I mean that to say he bombed Iraq for a few days in 1998 and it didn't cause World War 3 it didn't cause the end of the world have worked out just fine and it actually led in not strongly enough but it did feed into a u.s. policy which was to oppose Saddam Hussein it didn't really do much one where the other didn't cause World War three every day a Barack Obama's presidency was spent attacking the Middle East George Bush obviously after 9/11 after we were attacked the worst attack on American soil we had to deal with those countries in the Middle East Bill Clinton obviously George Bush the first George HW Bush led the Gulf War Ronald Reagan sent peacekeeping forces to Lebanon during that country's Civil War to maintain order in the region Jimmy Carter didn't but Jimmy Carter's a terrible president so who cares what he did Richard Nixon backed Israel after Egypt and Syria invaded during the Yom Kippur War at one point Richard Nixon actually ordered an airlift to resupply the Israeli forces so they didn't get wiped out by the invading Muslim forces that's certainly an intervention Dwight Eisenhower overthrew the Iranian election in 1953 to reinstall the Shah this is a long-standing tradition this is nothing new with Donald Trump and people on the left and the right on the extreme left for the extreme right should not freak out about this this transcends political boundaries and also this implies a strategy that works a lot of conservatives from the libertarians to the traditionalists and that's mowing the lawn this probably should be the Trump doctrine this probably should be American foreign policy in the twenty first century mowing the lawn the left and the isolationists right blamed the u.s. for the Middle East's problems they say you know if we just didn't interfere in the Middle East then they would really like us if we didn't interfere in the Middle East then the civilization that has been at war with the West for fourteen hundred years they'll like us then then they'll really like us and stop trying to invade I know they've been trying to invade since the year 732 but they'll probably stop if we just it's America's fault because they've been doing it since 732 and America has been around since 1776 but yeah they'll probably just stop that isn't that's ridiculous certainly in the twentieth century after independence for a lot of these countries and the Islamic resurgence in those countries have brought a lot of instability to the region and sometimes you have to mow the lawn and buy mow the lawn I mean you know be in America preserve our Liberty keep our money build a great country be a beacon of Liberty of the rest of the world facing out to the rest of the world decide who wants to come in try to help people out be overall good and productive and lift everybody up in the world rising tide lifts all ships and then every once in a while when they start to act up over in that godforsaken region go over and bomb them a little bit and get it all back in line because it this sounds like it's a like it's some bellicose thing or like it's very hawkish but it's I think it's actually the opposite of hawkish I'm not saying we should invade and run their countries forever and do all of this but you have to maintain stability or these events can spiral out of control there can be major crises whole genocides the use of awful weapons like chemical weapons or nuclear weapons you have to maintain some order to preserve the peace you need peace through strength you're not going to get peace through weakness that doesn't happen through weakness you get chaos and terror between 1969 and 2009 there were 38,000 345 terrorist attacks around the world the lion's share of those a higher percentage then against other countries were against the u.s. 7.8 percent of those attacks were just against the u.s. 2981 attacks those numbers come via the Heritage Foundation and the rand database of worldwide terrorism incidents you can't just leave that region alone because they'll come to get us this was this was the fiction that we labored under for a while that you could just leave it alone and then they they they won't get us who you do you we do us but then they flew airplanes over here and they did get us and they target American interests in American posts overseas and they come over here and they cause trouble they cause terrorist attacks they become breeding grounds for people whose only goal in life is to destroy the United States who hate our freedom because of what it is and because of who we are and because of the way that we live who have a long-standing tradition of despising the West and despising the civilization of the West and they're gonna come get us because now it's easier to get over here there isn't an ocean separating us permanently or with great difficulty one from another anymore it's very easy to get over here the instability over there can and will reach us you have to go in and you have to mow the lawn every once in a while that's just the way that these things work we are the world's superpower we don't have to be the world's superpower we are because we choose to be we have a massive economy we have a productive citizen Rhee we have a stable country relatively stable country sometimes with the tweets you think that maybe it's not that stable but it is a stable country and we have the military force of the world we defend all of our allies they have relatively small military forces and Americans get indecisive on this question sometimes we want to be the superpower sometimes we want to pretend that it's the 18th century and we can just be agrarians and can rely on the ocean to protect us the ocean didn't even protect us in the 17th and 18th and 19th centuries did they they the oceans didn't protect us then we had a whit of Revolutionary War and then they we had a second Revolutionary War in 1812 when the British tried to invade again even that even that dream of isolation was I think largely a fantasy and if the nations of the world look to us to preserve the World Order we have to do it I guess we cannot do it but then somebody else is going to come in then a bad guy is going to come in then China is going to run the World Order and they're going to dictate the world order do we want to live in that period do we want to live in that framework no nation would seriously challenge us in an all war that would not happen right now we spend more on our military than China Russia Saudi Arabia India France the UK and Japan combined at least actually significantly more than all of them that's a good thing I'm glad that we do that because that's that is so far from the majority of our federal budget the majority of our budget is unfunded liabilities and entitlement programs in the welfare state and for a relatively small amount of money we get to run the world the way that we want to run the world which coincidentally is the best way for us and everybody it's the fairest it's the freest it's the most just it's the most equitable it's the most prosperous we shouldn't back away from that that's not a bad thing and if it means we have to go mow the lawn every once in a while so be it so be it what was the what was the problem that happened with the strikes in Syria what was the real cost to America there was no cost of American lives thankfully there was no cost to American politics really and it was a pinprick strike that took out a lot of chemical facilities that's fine by me and it defended the credibility of the United States - Alex Jones's point is there a possibility of a superpower conflict of course there is there's always a possibility of that and that M there's been one building for a long time we have trade tensions with China China's aggressing into the South China Sea the leader of China Xi Jinping is now pretty firmly established as practically a dictator similarly if Vladimir Putin is practically a dictator in Russia if not if not de jure than certainly de facto and Russia aggresses into Ukraine starts invading its neighbours interferes in Western politics poisons defectors in the United Kingdom that's the backdrop to all of this so I suppose that all all-out war between superpowers or mid mid powers could occur but it's not going to occur because we shot some missiles into Syria and mowed the lawn and defended the credibility of the United States absolutely not - I still have a little bit of time to cover the good domestic news and then we're gonna have to get to this day in history in some good domestic news Democrats relentless attacks on Donald Trump are not working they actually aren't working it seems like it's constant barrage of attacks and they just aren't working so you know a special counsel Robert Mulder raided Trump's lawyers property Michael Cohen this creates a problem by the way because the president is having trouble getting a lawyer if you're Trump's lawyer you know you're gonna get your house raided you know it's going to be a difficult political situation five large firms have passed on representing President Trump in this investigation and so you have this whole backdrop you have the Muller investigation expanding to anything you know a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that Donald Trump ate in the 60s they're gonna analyze that and find some way to indict him for it then you have James Comey James commis ridiculous book and ridiculous interview this happened last night here's just a quick clip to give you a sense of James Comey I don't buy this stuff about him being financially incompetent the early stages of dementia he strikes me as a person of above-average intelligence who's tracking conversations and knows what's going on I don't think he's medically unfit to be President I think he's morally unfit to be President by the way Comey worked for Bill Clinton I just want to remind everybody of this joke James Comey was the managing assistant US attorney to Bill Clinton but no Trump is morally unfit because maybe he had a one-night stand with a porn star ten years before he became president and Bill Clinton was creating human humidors in the Oval Office during his tenure but oh but no he Joe Donald Trump is morally he's upset because he got fired but Andy's talking to George Stephanopoulos Bill Clinton's communications director this is this is the most ridiculous kind of Kabuki theater I've ever seen in politics I think you have this guy this jilted lover James Comey this disgruntled former employee who is a self-aggrandizing nut you know who is lied publicly who tried to insert himself into the presidential election who tried to play politics he thought oh he actually admitted to this he said I thought I had to release the Hillary letter at the end of the campaign because when Hillary won I didn't want her to be illegitimate so he's orys obviously as all these political considerations in his head and then he's talking to George Stephanopoulos who's main claim to fame is that he is the guy who spins the news for the Clintons that was his job that's why we know his name so he got his job at ABC there was nothing in this interview by the way nearly 10 million people watched they got nothing for it really just just insults saying oh he's not fit he's not mmm he isn't easy at a porn star wham went another nothing burger to use van Joneses term and and then speaking of the porn star that's another aspect of media keep throwing at us to get Trump's approval rating down that porn star describing the details of her one night stand with Donald Trump just to give you a sense of stormy Daniels it's not like she's this you know she used to have this sordid past and Trump took advantage of her and now she's gotten her life together and she's damaged and me too and all this she's still a stripper she still does all of this stuff she's she's a sex worker to use the modern phrase she a political operative friend of mine invited me to a stormy Daniel show he thought it'd be funny being that I could wear like a make America great again hat and go see stormy Daniels dance or something I ran it by sweet little ELISA surprisingly she wasn't that supportive of the idea and you know that's the kind of person we're talking about we're talking about a currently working stripper who was arrested in 2010 for domestic violence at that time stormy Daniels was thinking about running for Senate against Vitter I think against another Republican so she's clearly headed out for Republicans for a long time now and she's clearly wanted to aggrandize herself on the political stage for a long time and she's also a working stripper that's what we're seeing and they're using bad she's like this pinnacle of virtue and honesty and James Comey a guy that all the Democrats a year and a half ago said was basically the scum of the earth now they like him because he's hitting Donald Trump with all of that guess what Donald Trump's poll numbers are take it yeah do you want to guess 51% 51% approval according to Rasmussen which is the only daily presidential tracking poll left all of that the entire apparatus you've got the bureaucracy working against him you have the Democrats gende up like they haven't since the last Republican president and you've got half of the Republican Party too timid to support their own guy you've got all of these things working against Donald Trump and yet more than half the country still approves of this job day to day day today that's the the last daily tracking poll left Donald Trump's numbers by the way have been hovering around there for quite a while and they're higher than Barack Obama's approval ratings at this time in his presidency but at this time in bama's presidency was 47 48 percent now I know what you're gonna say you're gonna say yeah but at this time in Barack Obama's presidency he was headed for a wipeout in the midterms and it's true the 2010 midterms did wipe out the Democrats but that that seems like a good point until you look a little deeper into it the trouble with Barack Obama his electoral troubles in those midterm wipeouts were never his problems he always remained popular 48% is a solid number a solid approval rating if you're president not as good as 51% which Trump has but it's a very solid number Barack Obama always remained popular that's why the Congress the Republicans totally took over the Congress but Obama got re-elected that's that's why people hated Obama's policies but they liked him personally and even with that Donald Trump's approval rating is still higher than Donald Trump's this will be shocking to people who believe what they see on the news who watch ABC and George Stephanopoulos former Clinton employee former Clinton flak and they say why I can't believe what everyone hates Trump oh except for more than half the country right conventional wisdom what does this mean for the the midterms the conventional wisdom says Republicans are going to get blown out in the midterms Democrats only have to flip 24 congressional seats it's the it's the house so every seat is up for grabs 48 seats are considered competitive here so but more than enough almost twice you know it exactly twice as many as as need to be flipped and the vast majority of competitive seats are in Republican districts okay that's bad that doesn't look good and historically speaking the party in power always gets tossed out in these midterms but drill down a little bit only 22 seats right in 2018 or considered toss up 26 seats lean slightly one way or the other and of those lean one way or the other 16 lean Republican 10 lean Democrat that kind of temper is the views of this blue wave like Morgan Freeman and deep impact seeing the thing come I don't know the numbers I don't know if they necessarily back that up the history seems to imply that but to the numbers on the ground does the daily presidential approval rating I don't know do the tax cuts that Americans just got do I don't know in the Senate there are a lot more vulnerable Democrats than Republicans this year there's a obviously a thin GOP minority in the Senate but it's not a good map for Democrats next time will be a good map for Democrats this year doesn't look great for them so the conventional wisdom says this is gonna be a bad year for Republicans even with all of those details I just gave you you still think it's gonna be a bad year for Republicans except that conventional wisdom is only reliable in conventional times these are not conventional times as as the former FBI director you know having like a war of words and yelling insults at Donald Trump on TV and then the porn star from 2006 going on and she's still stripping but she's also and then the rate of the president's lawyer and then after were in it these are not normal times and President khofifah himself not last but not least of the abnormal things going on in this political time these are not normal times my recommendation to Republicans is by all rights by all rights Republicans should get blown out in the midterms all of the indicators seem to point that way and yet below the surface I don't know and yet these aren't conventional times and yet Donald Trump's a survivor and yet the media lie to us Republicans have to go out there and vote if we can hold the Senate and possibly hold the house or not lose too many seats in the House or whatever if we can do that this the mainstream media will crack they will cry they will fill up this leftist here's tumblr most importantly it will be a wonderful thing for American politics it will be so unexpected all over again maybe even better because they really think they've got him again but it'll fill up the leftist years tumblr and that's why you have to go to Daley wire dot-com I have to remind everybody you can find my show the Michael Noel's show on daily wired.com Facebook

this day in history on this day in history George Washington leaves Mount Vernon to be inaugurated president on this day in 1789 newly elected president and father of his country George Washington left his home in Mount Vernon Virginia and headed to New York to be sworn in as the first president and I actually used to live in New York right by where Washington was sworn in it's very cool it's downtown in New York he went all the way up there and he did not want to go up there before leaving George Washington addressed a group of citizens about how much he did not want to be President this is not just private writings he's at Mount Vernon he's in Virginia he's about to go become the first president of the United States and he decides to convene a group of people and complain about it because he doesn't want to do it he says at my age what possible advantages could I gain from public life in Washington at the time by the way was only 57 young man even for his era not not some old man but the Washington's tended to die early his father's great grandfather's grandfather they they all died pretty young in Washington was keenly aware of this he wrote in his diary about leaving to be inaugurated he said I bade adieu to Mount Vernon to private life into domestic Felicity and with a mind oppressed with more anxious and painful sensations than I have words to express that doesn't sound very excited he had already resigned his military commission at the end of the Revolutionary War so he leads the army throughout the revolution he's you know really is the father of his country and then he resigns his military commission and there was some question will he will he become a king will he rule the country himself but he went and he asked Congress he said how do you want me to resign I'm gonna resign how do you want me to do it and then they told him how and King George the third his foe in that war because he did this called Washington the most distinguished of any man living the greatest character of the age as his last pose was a heroic act then he goes to Mount Vernon I mean lives a happy life he didn't want to be President he certainly didn't want to leave his wife behind to go up to New York and he also didn't want to leave his servant Billy Lee behind he just didn't want to leave his life he liked his life in a good life and he wasn't just kidding by the way I think we now look back on Washington who says oh I don't want to be President I want to be President I don't want to do this I don't want to do this and we think he was just kidding or he didn't he was playing coy you know he obviously wanted to be president but he couldn't say that and it was just politicking or whatever no he wasn't kidding he really did not want to be President he took up that job only because rival political factions in the u.s. were already threatening the independence that was won in the American Revolution I think some people like to pretend that the political factions of Federalists and the anti-federalists they sort of sprung up later and that's when the parties began not true they begin immediately because it's the natural state of politics as politics should be different people with different visions and different interests organize into different groups and then they try to enact their vision over someone else's vision that's the natural state of politics we shouldn't wish to get a rid of party's political parties are a wonderful thing they helped us organize our political visions and effect them so at this point the Federalists guys like John Adams are Alexander Hamilton they are begging Washington to be president in 1788 Alexander Hamilton wrote to Washington basically demanding that he'd do it basically saying you're gonna have to be President Washington responded to that letter and he responded on the quote delicate subject with which you conclude your letter I can say nothing because the event alluded to may never happen and because in case it should occur it would be a point of prudence to defer forming one's ultimate and irrevocable decisions it is my great and sole desire to live and die in peace and retirement on my own farm I don't you can't say it much more clearly than that I want to live you didn't say I want to live you know politicians do this today they say oh I'm really enjoying what I'm doing oh I really like running my business oh yeah no I don't want to run for president until the next possible opportunity and then I'll do it Washington is very clear with his words he was meticulous he chose his words carefully I want to live and die in peace here on this farm stop bothering me Alexander he wrote all George Washington I should unfeigned Lee rejoice in case the electors by giving their votes to another person would save me from the dreaded dilemma of being forced to accept or refuse if that may not be I am in the next place earnestly desirous of searching out the truth and knowing whether there does not exist a probability that the government would be just as happily and effectually carried into execution without my aid leave me alone leave me alone leave me alone leave me alone he then goes on to say I call heaven to witness that this very act would be the greatest sacrifice of my personal feelings and wishes that ever I have been called upon to make this is a guy who has spent his entire life getting shot at this is a guy who spent his entire life in squalor terrible conditions starving not with adequate clothing not with adequate ammunition shooting at people and being shot at and he says that's basically a cakewalk compared to making me leave my farm and become president that he you cannot interpret this as some coyness he's saying it as clearly as he can now if Washington had to be president he wrote that he hoped that at a convenient and early period my services might be dispensed with and that I might be permitted once more to retire to pass an unclouded evening after the stormy day of life in the bosom of domestic tranquillity and he did it you know some people say they're amazed that Washington didn't go for a third or fourth term but anybody familiar with Washington's thoughts on this should be amazed that he accepted a second term you know he just didn't want it FDR if he had lived probably would have served 16 terms he wanted to be a king he made himself an American King but George Washington it really didn't want to do it and that is a real attitude to look for in our political leaders and here's why that's not just some platitude that's not just saying oh we want the reluctant leader there were oh that's nice it shows he's kind of got control of himself and his ambitions that's actually not why running for president certainly holding that office really holding any political office but especially the as big ones destroys your family you don't get to see your family your lambasted in the press lies and calumny and all sorts of awful things are told about you certain things from your past that you don't want to cut skeletons come out of the closet it opens you up to constant assault by just absolute villains they'll maybe they'll find some villains in you some skeletons in your closet or they'll just make it up they'll just completely fabricate things as they do all the time with everybody who runs for that high office it entails grave responsibility for the safety and security of your fellow countrymen it ages you dramatically it depletes your wealth or it should you're not supposed to make money and in office and the and there are a lot of watchdogs and you know you make money maybe after office if you're a Barack Obama or Bill Clinton or somebody but it depletes your wealth and it obliterates your privacy it's just a terrible thing it's a terrible awful burden to do that if somebody is eager to forfeit all of those things he's probably not the man for the job if somebody's eager to do it he would have to be psychotic why would you want to do it when you could live in private life and have a good life well if you have it if you have your life in order and you've got your Mount Vernon and you've got your Martha Washington and you've got your private business and your business is ideally run out of your home and you've just got your life and a nice balance why would you want to sacrifice all of that for a thankless job that will have you pilloried keep you away from your family and losing money you'd have to be insane but a lot of people are insane and they want to do it because they want Fame and they want power and they want to use it for grift and make money afterwards like the Clintons lots of politicians start running for office right after college or law school in their 20s or 30s running for office is not honorable in and of itself it isn't it it can be honorable what George Washington did was honorable and admirable the country would have fallen apart if he had not agreed to be the first president I'm pretty convinced of that it just would have disintegrated and all of the hard-fought victories of the Revolutionary War would have been for nothing and the country might have ended up worse than it was before or the British would have just invaded again as they did in 1812 it's not a it's not admirable of itself Bill Clinton is not George Washington he's just a crass politician who started running for office in his own mind probably at the age of three and in reality after law school some of the greatest politicians in our history have been citizen legislators you know they've been people who have who have lives who have done things in their life and have a nice farm in Mount Vernon and cute little ol Martha sitting there stitching up American flags or whatever she was doing and they decide that for the good of their country and because they feel some that it's virtuous and it's their duty to help their country they'll go and do a stint and then I'll go back home and hang out with Martha when when a lifelong politicians all start Hilary a citizen legislator or a citizen executive or one of the guys who's actually doing that when all these guys who have been in politics since they were you know 22 they ran for elective office the first time they've been in DC that old time when those guys start pillar ring people who were who are following the model of living a normal life and then doing your duty for the country for a little bit that's usually a sign that that citizen legislator or executive is the right man for the job important thing is to consider these days okay that's our show I am heading out like right now to get on a plane I'm going to Alabama I'll be speaking at the Alabama Policy Institute in Mobile
