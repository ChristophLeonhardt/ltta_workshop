HEATHER: NEGOTIATING WITH NORTH
KOREA DONALD TRUMP PLEDGING TO
END WARGAMES ON THE KOREAN
PENINSULA AS PART OF THE DEAL
FOR COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION.
>> WE WILL BE STOPPING THE
WARGAMES WHICH WILL SAVE US A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE
FUTURE NEGOTIATION IS NOT GOING
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD.
WE WILL BE SAVING A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF MONEY.
PLUS I THINK IT IS VERY
PROVOCATIVE.
HEATHER: SAY THAT COULD BE A
DANGEROUS MOVE TO MAKE.
GORDON CHANG IS THE AUTHOR OF
NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN, NORTH KOREA
TAKES OVER THE WORLD AND HE
JOINS ME.
I ASKED ABOUT THIS THING TO BE
THE ONLY CONCESSION BEING MADE
AT THIS POINT, ADAMANTLY NOT A
GOOD IDEA.
>> IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE
OUR EXERCISES KEEP US AT A HIGH
STATE OF READINESS.
WE NEED TO BE AT THE HIGH STEAK,
TO DEFEND SOUTH KOREA.
ALL THIS WILL HE WROTE VERY
QUICKLY.
THESE NEGOTIATIONS ON
DENUCLEARIZATION TAKE YEARS,
THEN WE COULD HAVE A HOLLOW
FORCE TEMPTING NORTH KOREA TO
INVADE.
HEATHER: JUST A PAUSE, DELAYING
THEM, SUSPENDING THEM AND THERE
HAS ALREADY BEEN ONE THIS YEAR.
>> LOOK AT THESE TWO, WE HAVE
TWO SETS OF EXERCISES.
THE IMPORTANT ONE, MEANT TO
COINCIDE WITH NORTH KOREA'S
TRAINING CYCLE AND A HIGH STATE
OF READINESS WE ARE AT HIGH
STATE OF READINESS, THESE
EXERCISES TAKE PLACE IN MARCH,
MARCH IS CRITICAL, THAT IS WHAT
NORTH KOREA WOULD ATTACK, THE
GROUND WOULD BE FROZEN, GREAT
FOR TANKS AND THE SOUTH KOREANS
HAVEN'T FLOODED THEIR FIELDS YET
SO THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR NORTH
KOREA TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM IS I
DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP GOT A
COMMITMENT TO END THEIR WINTER
TRAINING CYCLE.
>> THAT WOULD BE THE KEY TO FIND
OUT, IF THEY ARE GOING TO STOP
THEIR TRAINING CYCLE.
LISTEN TO WHAT TOM COTTON HAD TO
SAY.
LISTEN TO HIM.
>> WE JUST HAD THE BIGGEST
EXERCISE EACH YEAR IN THE
SPRING, PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN
FOR ANOTHER 10 MONTHS UNTIL
SPRING OF 2019.
WE WILL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD READ
ON WHETHER KIM JONG UN WILL KEEP
HIS COMMITMENT.
SECRETARY MATTIS SUPPORTS THE
DECISION, REGULAR EVERYDAY
>> DURING THE YEAR YOU DO HAVE A
LEVEL OF TRAINING,
>> DURING THE YEAR YOU DO HAVE A
LEVEL OF TRAINING, AND EXERCISES
THAT COINCIDE WITH WHEN THE
NORTH KOREANS DO.
EVEN IF NORTH KOREA DIDN'T HAVE
NUKES THEY STILL HAVE CHEMICAL
AND BIOLOGICAL AGENTS, STILL
HAVE AN ESTIMATED 14,300
ARTILLERY TUBES NORTH OF THE
DEMILITARIZED ZONE WHICH
SEPARATES THE TWO CORREIAS AND
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE, NORTH
KOREA'S FORCES, 70% ARE DEPLOYED
ON THE DMZ BELOW THE LINE.
THAT HAS GOT TO CHANGE IF WE
SUSPEND OUR EXERCISES, NORTH
KOREA HAS TO MAKE A
CORRESPONDING COMMITMENT TO PULL
BACK.
>> WE HAVE CONTINUING MEETINGS
GOING ON NEXT WEEK.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN TERMS OF
STEPS FOR DIPLOMACY?
>> DONALD TRUMP IS DOING THE
RIGHT THING.
WE HAVE SECRETARY OF STATE
POMPEO TO EXPLAIN WHAT OCCURRED,
WE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH OUR
ALLIES.
DONALD TRUMP DID NOT WASTE TIME
AND THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO
PROCEED AND POMPEO AND NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON
TALKING WITH NORTH KOREAN
OFFICIALS AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK
SO DONALD TRUMP IS RIGHT, THIS
IS GOT TO OCCUR QUICKLY.
HEATHER: TERMS OF EVERYTHING
LAID OUT BEFORE KEY PRIORITIES,
THE INITIAL JOINT DOCUMENT, NOT
ENOUGH DETAILS AT THIS POINT.
WE ARE LOOKING AT A PRELIMINARY
DOCUMENT AND PEOPLE CRITICIZE IT
AND DEFEND IT.
WE WON'T KNOW IF THESE PROCEED
AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY ARE.
WE KNOW THE NORTH KOREANS ARE
DECLARING THIS TO BE A VICTORY
FOR THEMSELVES, PROPAGANDA IS
VERY CORROSIVE AND UNDERCUTS OUR
MESSAGE
VERY CORROSIVE AND UNDERCUTS OUR
MESSAGE THEY WANT TO GIVE UP THE
