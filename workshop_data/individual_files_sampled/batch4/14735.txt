and that's the beauty of the law if you can write it you can convince all others to follow it just like all of us do today when we should many of the laws existing we should be violating those laws what you just saw was professor Albert Potts openly urging his students to break the law no covert innuendo no Suttle insinuation just a blatant recommendation to go out and commit crime now surely like the mainstream media would have us believe this guy must be some neo-nazi terrorists calling for violence against non-whites right we do it through the Constitution which should we call a white man's Constitution Karl Marx is one of the most profound thinkers in the history of Western philosophy well if he is a bigoted right winger he's probably the first one I've seen he idolizes Karl Marx seriously though this far left professor lectures in the political science department at Diablo Valley College in California and he's not teaching some radical elective classes only a handful of self-hating social justice activists with a promising future and unemployment take no the school trust spots with teaching political theory introduction to politics in American government and if Diablo Valley College sounds familiar to you it should is the same school that employed Eric Clanton the bike walk professor who assaulted a Trump supporter at Berkeley Oh shitty plead no yo-yo man is bleeding and surprise surprise Diablo Valley College continuously ranks among the top transfer pathways to UC Berkeley with the reputation that schools garnered after the 2017 Antipa riots that's a bit like boasting your small-town prison has the most inmates you go on to excel at Guantanamo Bay anyways back to Professor pause abolition means we must destroy it not reforming nobodies we need to smash white supremacy so abolition of who knows what meritocracy apparently can't be achieved through legal means this does this guy realize all of the most famous instances of abolition have been done through law and when abolition is not done through law it's usually called or accompanied by riots genocide things that we typically try to avoid in Western democracies oh and in case you couldn't guess by now pause is not a big fan of the American flag we're taught to get up and pledge allegiance to the flag every single day maybe that's the way she'd be popular all those with this flag represent stand up and all anything to undermine the nation right michaelsavage talks about borders language culture and the left loathes these things because they're incompatible with equality of outcome their obstacles to the happy homogeneous communist utopia packed with lot police and welfare checks now it's fine for people to express these views but when they're introduced as facts in the classroom with no opposing world views for balance when they're paired with violence and incitement well that's when education becomes indoctrination for campus unmasked I'm Rob Simms Jacque if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
