00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:19,740

4
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:21,542
DO NOT WAIT FOR THE PERFECT

5
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:21,876
MESSAGE.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,746
ARE EXPECTING POLITICIANS TO

7
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:27,681
BE SO INSPIRING AND POETIC

8
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:28,616
AND MOVING BECAUSE THAT IS

9
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:29,750
PART OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

10
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:31,385
LAST ELECTION.

11
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:32,620

>> GOOD MORNING ABBY AND ED.

20
00:00:47,202 --> 00:00:47,801
DEAN: GOOD MORNING.

21
00:00:47,802 --> 00:00:48,369
ABBY: PRESIDENT OBAMA

22
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,770
FAMOUSLY SAID ELECTIONS HAVE

23
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:50,804
CONSEQUENCES WE ARE SIGHING

24
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:54,875
THAT PLAY OUT NOW HUGE

25
00:00:57,212 --> 00:00:57,912
MESSAGE TO THE DEMOCRATIC

26
00:00:57,913 --> 00:00:58,212
PARTY.

27
00:00:58,213 --> 00:00:59,146
>> WELL, THE DEMOCRATIC

28
00:00:59,147 --> 00:01:00,314
PARTY HAS A LEADERSHIP

29
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:01,582
CRISIS AND A MESSAGING

30
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,350
CRISIS AND IT'S IN PART DUE

31
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:04,985
TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.

32
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:07,421
BECAUSE HE LED FROM A

33
00:01:07,422 --> 00:01:08,622
POSITION OF JUST BEING IN

34
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:10,224
THE POSITION AND APPEASEMENT

35
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:12,259
AND YOU ARE RIGHT, IT HAS

36
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,693
CONSEQUENCES.

37
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:13,794
EXCEPT NOW WE ARE SEEING A

38
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:15,563
LOT OF POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES

39
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:17,364
OF THIS ELECTION BY ELECTING

40
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:18,632
THIS PRESIDENT.

41
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:24,238
FOR A PERFECT MESSAGE.

42
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,673
THEY HAVE A MESSAGE CRISIS.

43
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:26,373
THEY SHOULDN'T BE WAITING

44
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:27,575
FOR THE PERFECT LEADER.

45
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:28,409
THEY DON'T HAVE A LEADER

46
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:28,909
RIGHT NOW.

47
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,110
THEY HAVE A LOT OF VOICES

48
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:32,580
MAKING A LOT OF NOISE AND

49
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:37,518
AND SCARE PEOPLE AND MAKE

50
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,354
PEOPLE ANGRY.

51
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:41,522
DEAN: HERE'S A QUOTE FROM

52
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:45,192
HONEST WITH YOU, IF I EVER

53
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:46,493
REGRET DURING MY PRESIDENCY,

54
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:47,995
IT IS THAT PEOPLE WERE SO

55
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:50,965
PARTICULARLY AFTER WE LOST

56
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:53,300
THE HOUSE THAT FOLKS STOPPED

57
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:54,735
PAYING ATTENTION UP AND DOWN

58
00:01:54,736 --> 00:01:55,336
THE BALLOT.

59
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:58,372
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

60
00:01:58,373 --> 00:01:59,206
>> I DON'T THINK THAT

61
00:01:59,207 --> 00:01:59,940
STATEMENT IS TRUE.

62
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:00,741
HERE'S WHY.

63
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:01,609
PEOPLE GOT TIRED OF LOOKING

64
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:06,180
AT ALL OF THE RHETORIC AND

65
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:06,614
NO RESULTS.

66
00:02:06,615 --> 00:02:07,815
THE ONLY RESULTS THAT THE

67
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:08,515
ADMINISTRATION COULD HANG

68
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:10,883
ITS HAT ON ALONG WITH THE

69
00:02:10,884 --> 00:02:13,320
DEMOCRATS WAS FORCING THE

70
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:14,855
UNAFFORDABLE CARE ACT DOWN

71
00:02:14,856 --> 00:02:16,390
OUR THROATS.

72
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:23,998
STALLED.

73
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:25,766
STARTING WITH THE GDP GROWTH

74
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,305
AND NOW WE ARE PREDICTING A

75
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:35,109
3.5 TO 4% G.D.P. GROWTH,

76
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,210
JUST IN THE FIRST 17 MONTHS

77
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:37,978
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION.

78
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:40,981
SO I THINK THAT THERE IS A

79
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:47,655
CONSEQUENCES OF APPEASEMENT

80
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:49,723
BY THE PREVIOUS

81
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:50,257
ADMINISTRATION.

82
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:52,793
IT GOES EVEN FURTHER.

83
00:02:52,794 --> 00:02:54,161
AS YOU KNOW THE ATLANTA FED

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,501
4.5% IN THE NEXT QUARTER.

85
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:02,303
AND YOU HAVE GOT THIS 6

86
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:03,404
MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TAX

87
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:03,671
CUT.

88
00:03:03,672 --> 00:03:04,538
THE PRESIDENT CUTTING ALL

89
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:05,639
THESE REGULATIONS FOR OVER A

90
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,507
YEAR NOW.

91
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:08,709
THERE HAS BEEN AN IMPACT.

92
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,611
>> THERE HAS BEEN AN IMPACT.

93
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:12,446
THIS IS WHY THE DEMOCRATS'

94
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:13,981
HEADS ARE EXPLODING.

95
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:16,283
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO

96
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:20,421
ELIZABETH WARREN TALKING

97
00:03:20,422 --> 00:03:21,388
ABOUT RIPPING BABIES FROM

98
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:21,755
FAMILIES.

99
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:22,823
THEY HAVE BEEN EXERCISING

100
00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:24,892
THESE PROCEDURES FOR TWO AND

101
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:27,227
THREE ADMINISTRATIONS NOW.

102
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:31,632
AND THEN WITH HELD

103
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:31,665
AND THEN WITH GELD

104
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:31,699
AND THEN WITH GILD

105
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,766
AND THEN WITH GILLIBRAND

106
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:34,468
TALKING ABOUT ABOLISHING ICE

107
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:35,669
WITH NO IDEA HOW TO DO

108
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,370
THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

109
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,371
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE SAYING

110
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:38,639
ALL OF THIS POISONOUS

111
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,473
RHETORIC AND DOING THE

112
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:40,607
THINGS THEY ARE DOING,

113
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:41,975
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE NEW

114
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:43,210
G.D.P. NUMBERS, THE JOB

115
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,345
NUMBERS ARE JUST GOING TO

116
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:45,346
BLOW PEOPLE AWAY.

117
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:47,881
SO THEY ARE JUST USING THE

118
00:03:47,882 --> 00:00:00,000
TYPICAL, NEGATIVE RHETORIC.
