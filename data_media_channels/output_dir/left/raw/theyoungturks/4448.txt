1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,530
IF YOU HAVE BEEN CONFUSED
WHILE TRYING TO FOLLOW THE LEGAL

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,720
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COURT CASES
IN DIFFERENT STATES AROUND THE

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,960
COUNTRY HAVING TO DO WITH DONALD
TRUMP'S MUSLIM TRAVEL BAN, I

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
CAN'T BLAME YOU.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,019
IT HAS BEEN
CONFUSING.

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,019
BUT YOU SHOULD BEAR

7
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:17,060
IN MIND WHILE LOOKING AT THESE
CONSTANT BACK-AND-FORTH THAT --

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:34,620
>>THERE ARE THESE VARIOUS COURT
CHALLENGES, AND WE WILL KNOW

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,190
DEFINITIVELY ON OCTOBER 10 WHEN
THE SUPREME COURT GIVES THE

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,530
TRAVEL BAN A FULL REVIEW.

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,750
THERE
HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,300
SECTIONS OF IT, DEFINE CERTAIN
TERMS IN REGARDS TO IT, BUT

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,200
THESE ARE ALL TEMPORARY MEASURES
UNTIL THE SUPREME COURT DOES

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,940
THAT REVIEW IN OCTOBER.

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,510
THAT
BEING SAID, WE DO HAVE ANOTHER

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,049
DEVELOPMENT TO ADD ON TO WHAT
YOU PREVIOUSLY LEARNED, THIS HAS

17
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,630
TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP'S
ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK PEOPLE USING

18
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,100
HAVING GRANDPARENTS AND OTHER
CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS AS A

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,070
RATIONALE TO BE ALLOWED TO ENTER
THE COUNTRY.

20
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,070
HE DIDN'T WANT THAT

21
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,080
TO BE THE CASE, AND THE SUPREME
COURT DOESN'T AGREE WITH HIM.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,280
ALTHOUGH HE DID GET SOMETHING
OUT OF WHAT WAS REVEALED TODAY

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
--

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:39,750
>>THAT IS SORT OF THE GOOD
NEWS FOR THOSE PEOPLE.

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,750
UNFORTUNATELY --

26
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:51,490
>>A LITTLE GIVE, A LITTLE TAKE
ON THE BAN.

27
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,530
THE BAN IS NOT

28
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,280
HALTED, IT IS A LITTLE BIT LESS
STRICT, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY.

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,590
>>I'M JUST GLAD THAT TRUMP IS
USING THIS INCREDIBLY CRITICAL

30
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,380
TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON, BECAUSE HE JUST

31
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,580
NEEDED SIX MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.

32
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,580
HE

33
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,719
HASN'T QUITE BEEN IN OFFICE FOR
-- OH, WAIT A MINUTE, HE HAD A

34
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:15,189
LOT OF TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
THE HELL HAS BEEN GOING ON.

35
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:16,189
BUT

36
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:21,810
HE IS BUSY HOLDING MEETINGS WITH
WORLD LEADERS THAT TRUMP

37
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,049
PROPERTIES SO HE CAN LINE HIS
POCKETS WITH THE POSITION HE

38
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:27,560
HAS, BUT NO ONE CARES ABOUT THAT
CONFLICT OF INTEREST -- HE'S

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,709
BUSY GOLFING, GOING TO FLORIDA.

40
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,629
THOSE ARE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT

41
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,140
THINGS, SO HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL IS

42
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,140
GOING ON.

43
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,349
SO I'M GLAD THAT WE
ARE NOW WASTING OUR PRECIOUS

44
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:44,560
RESOURCES ON TRYING TO
ADJUDICATE HOW THIS TRAVEL BAN

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,319
CAN LEGALLY MOVE FORWARD.

46
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,010
IT'S
FRUSTRATING, I THINK HIS FEAR

47
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,110
MONGERING AND THE FEAR MONGERING
FROM THE RIGHT HAS UNFORTUNATELY

48
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,959
WORKED TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE
NEEDLESSLY SUPPORT THIS

49
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,709
RIDICULOUS TRAVEL BAN, BUT
WHATEVER.

50
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:02,709
IF YOU WOULD RATHER

51
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:06,459
SEE TAXPAYER MONEY GO TOWARD
THIS EFFORT THAN TAKING CARE OF

52
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,189
OUR ACTUAL CITIZENS, THAT'S
FINE.

53
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,189
AND THAT'S THE THING, THEY

54
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,480
THINK THIS WILL TAKE CARE OF US.

55
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,950
THEY ARE NOT LOOKING INTO

56
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,409
RIGHT-WING TERRORISM IN THE
COUNTRY, THEY ARE NOT LOOKING AT

57
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:21,040
ACTUAL ISSUES THAT PUT OUR
SAFETY IN JEOPARDY, THEY ARE

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,250
JUST LOOKING AT THESE
NONEXISTENT THREATS FROM

59
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,629
REFUGEES, PEOPLE WHO LITERALLY
WANT TO ESCAPE DEATH AND

60
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,700
PERSECUTION IN THEIR OWN
COUNTRIES.

61
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,319
>>I WILL SAY THAT THROUGHOUT THE
YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF

62
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,120
BIG MOVEMENTS AND MARCHES AND
RALLIES ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
ISSUES.

64
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,760
YOU'VE HAD DONALD
TRUMP'S TAXES, CLIMATE SCIENCE,

65
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,459
THE WOMEN'S MARCH -- BUT THERE
WAS ALSO MULTIPLE DAYS OF

66
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,639
RALLYING AT AIRPORTS, MANY
MEMBERS OF TYT WENT, I WAS LUCKY

67
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:56,980
ENOUGH TO GO TWICE TO THE L.A.
BRANCH OF IT, TO PROTECT

68
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,379
PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO THE COUNTRY,
TO NOT STIGMATIZE AND BLOCK

69
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,989
THESE PEOPLE FROM THESE
COUNTRIES FROM COMING IN.

70
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:05,989
THERE

71
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:08,159
WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE
COUNTRY ORGANIZING FOR THAT.

72
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,829
AND

73
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:11,720
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD HAVE
EXPECTED THAT THAT WOULD'VE

74
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,329
DRAWN AS MUCH SUPPORT, BECAUSE
OF WHAT WE FEAR ABOUT PEOPLE'S

75
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:18,769
XENOPHOBIA THAT THEY LEARNED
FROM THE RIGHT.

76
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:19,769
IT'S ONE THING

77
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,330
TO ORGANIZE FOR CLIMATE SCIENCE,
IT'S ANOTHER TO ORGANIZE FOR

78
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,949
WOMEN, BUT THIS IS ALMOST P
REALLY, ASIDE FROM OBVIOUSLY

79
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:28,139
SOME AMERICAN MUSLIMS WHO ARE
ORGANIZING, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

80
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,800
DOING IT FOR PEOPLE THEY DON'T
KNOW BUT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,819
IT'S RIGHT.

82
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,560
I FOUND THAT TO BE
INSPIRATIONAL EARLIER THIS YEAR.

83
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,090
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
ON OCTOBER 10, BUT WHEN THE

84
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,139
SUPREME COURT CONSIDERS THIS AND
RELEASES A RULING, WE DON'T KNOW

85
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,830
IF THE ENTIRE THING WILL BE
UPHELD OR KNOCKED DOWN OR SOME

86
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,669
PART OF IT WILL GO INTO EFFECT
AND OTHERS WON'T. WE ARE JUST

87
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:52,810
TRYING TO READ FROM THEIR
INTERIM OPINIONS WHAT THEY MIGHT

88
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,810
THINK.

89
00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:00,800
WE DO KNOW THAT --

90
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,400
>>SO YOUR GRANDMA IS TOO BIG OF
A THREAT, ACCORDING TO AT LEAST

91
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
THOSE THREE JUSTICES.

92
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,250
AND THE
REST, WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY

93
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,350
WILL COME OUT ON IT.

94
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,710
WHILE THERE
HAS BEEN AT THE FEDERAL COURT

95
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,500
LEVEL, THE APPEALS COURT LEVEL,
THERE HAVE BEEN GOOD

96
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,790
DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE
INAUGURATION, THERE HAS ALSO

97
00:05:20,790 --> 00:00:00,000
BEEN REASON TO FEAR THAT SOME OF
IT MIGHT BECOME LAW.
