reporters not happy with a constant barrage of attacks that they get from Trump's White House of course press secretary the communications director and the list goes on and on and now of course the deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and and she was added against to the first question from a Breitbart reporter reporter and shockingly an alpha bright bright bright bart person in there decided that the the Trump White House was awesome in CNN was terrible and then they had these three CNN reporters who retracted a story and resigned and talked about that now perfectly fair story to talk about overall and and since CNN did retract that story they have invited a fair deal of criticism for that for running the story in the first place now if they're trying to correct it that should be something that should be lauded and not criticized but of course that's not how the Trump team is gonna go Trump himself had already tweeted about haha knew it it's fake news and they should retract all of their stories well you see if they retracted the story they're trying to do due diligence on it that means that they actually do diligence on their stories unlike your tweets which apparently no one does diligence on now this is the battle back and forth and then one reporter finally can't take it anymore it's Brian Karam editor of the Montgomery County Sentinel and so you'll see the deputy White House press secretary here Sanders first talking and then kerim comes in and they have a fun juicy fight let's talk let's watch just an absolute tirade from a lot of people in this room but news outlets get to go on day after day and cite unnamed sources use stories without sources have you know you mentioned the scare emoji story where they had to have reporters resign one parent whining everybody right here right now with those words you this administration has done that as well why in the name it happens in one of us right or replaceable and any one of us if we don't get it right the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or not read us I think and you have been elected to serve for four years at least there's no option other than that we ready to ask you questions right here to provide the answers and what you just did is inflammatory to people all over the country you look at and say see once again the president's right and everybody else out here is baked media and everybody in this room is only trying to do their job first of all I think if anything has been inflamed it's the dishonesty that often takes place by the news media and I think it is outrageous for you to accuse me of inflaming a story when I was simply trying to respond to this question my favorite part is at the end when she pretends to be outraged she had just gotten done talking about a barrage of fake news about the news media so she's telling everybody in the room there you guys are all fake you're phonies you make up stuff you're professional liars that's what they mean by hoax fake news it's like they're not being subtle about it and then so she goes around punching all them in the face and when they object she was I am shocked to chagrined I am just outraged that you would say that I'm inflaming things I mean I just said that you're all fakers and that the things that you write are all phony and lies I don't know why you would say that that's in flaming anyone how dare you accuse me of that it's conservative 101 punch someone in the face and when they go wait why did you punch me in the face say aren't you declare how uncivil of you to say that to charge me with purging you in the face yeah it's because that's what you just did it's on tape we saw it again that's proverbial sometimes in Trump rallies it's literal in this case she's been attacking them from day one it's about time they fought back a little bit I don't think that's that big a deal for for Karam there to suggest that perhaps the media is accountable and CNN actually asked you for those resignations and retracting stories part of that accountability whereas the White House appears to be accountable to no one so my conclusion is that the press in this little tiny fight back yeah he's not doing enough okay good good I want to applaud Brian Karen for a beginning just fight back a little bit and everybody's like wow every once in a while Jim across the tire asks a tough question and a little bit hearing that they are the Trump Whitehouse is lying non-stop non-stop so it they'll inflame you and then say how dare you accuse me of blaming you who did this a minute let alone the hundreds of other prevarications that Trump in that and the press team have put out there so yes engage engage in that battle you're supposed to be the watchdog's now supposed to be lap dogs so yes we've seen it more from journalists in the Trump administration that we have in others I wish they'd have been just as tough in a lot of ways on Obama and Bush now if you say hey the Obama administration didn't lie anywhere near this level you're absolutely right about that but there was plenty to challenge the Obama administration on but it was considered uncivil there was far more to challenge the Bush administration on but again uncivil but now that Trump is not part of the establishment there at least a little bit but I think that they feel a little self proud and and but I think that they're barely hit the tip of the iceberg so your job is to tell the American people what the reality is who cares if the Trump administration has their feelings hurt by it and there they feel outraged by it I die as a journalist you should not care about that even 1% of course the real reason that some of the people in that room care is because of access well then you'll lose your precious access which ironically leads me to my final point where she complains about unnamed sources well the trouble administration uses unnamed sources all the time they are the unnamed sources they're the anonymous sources they'll leak to the press and said now don't tell my name and then you go out in front of the press dare you use anonymous sources I can't believe it you remember Donald Trump is a guy who originally when before he became president would sometimes call the press pretending to be John Miller or John Baron these are made-up names and so for him to complain about sources that you're not really sure what their identity is the height of irony so you should throw out John Baron and John Miller too in their face every time that they do it and how much can you push people you know you think that Sarah Huckabee Sanders isn't one of those anonymous sources she's never been an anonymous source in any story Sean Spicer hasn't been Reince Priebus hasn't been Steve Bannon hasn't been Donald Trump hasn't been there's no way that that's true so please spare me the fake fake outrage Sarah Huckabee Sanders it's this is at best the beginning of a fight it should be nowhere near the end of it what's in TYT membership not gonna tell you only one way to find out TYT Network comm /join
