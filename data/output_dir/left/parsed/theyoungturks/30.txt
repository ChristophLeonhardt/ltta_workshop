"I’m a spokesperson for the
democratic party.
These are the values of the
American people.
Well at least americans that
live in san francisco and new york."
Oh goody, conservative humor.
You know, the best kind.
I mean, look at all those
hilarious right wing comedians.
"I publicly apologized to Hillary
Clinton for calling her a
beezabub I meant to call her bellzabub."
Well this video somehow went
viral and you all slid into me dm’s
asking I tear it limb from limb.
And you know us Scots can’t turn down a fight.
So alright, Amber, I’ll give it a listen.
"We promote inclusion and 
acceptance. Peace and good will."
And right off the bat she’s throwing trust
fund-sized rocks in hedge fund-sized houses.
Because everybody knows the
party of morals never wavers from
their family values, right?
"The world saw a trump supporter do
exactly what Donald Trump called for."
"Trump supporters pushing a woman
out of yesterdays rally."
"You know what would solve the whole
thing at the border if they just start shooting.
Only shoot a couple."
Oh...well, I mean, that’s just the supporters -
at least Republican leaders don’t engage
in any hateful rhetoric and I don’t know
always act with civility, right?
"Punch him in the face I’ll tell ya."
"Knock the crap out of them would ya seriously."
Well, maybe Alice comes alive in the second half?
"Republicans want to stop certain
people coming into this country.
They cite the infiltration of
gang violence or opioids or sex
trafficking as reasons to stop
illegal immigration.
But democrats accept these as the
natural consequence of opening
up our borders."
Oh so we got the old ms:13 are all
immigrants play, that’s not racist at all.
Well if that’s the case then is
this all conservatives I mean if
we’re playing by the same rules
this seems pretty accurate right?
"Republicans are always pushing
religion in our faces we reject their bigotry.
Religious people are idiots.
Democrats would much rather you sacrifice
yourself on the alter of progressivism."
No it’s not that we hate religion, we’re 
just reluctant to accept lessons on
morality from ‘Christians’ who
worship the ground of a thrice
married pussy grabber who raw
dogged an adult film star while
his wife and kid lay at home.
You know, just how Jesus intended.
But wait, isn’t islam a religion also?
Well I strictly remember one party in
particular vilifying members of that religion.
"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total
and complete shutdown of muslims
entering the United States."
But yeah it’s the left that are
intolerant of religion, got it.
"Democrats are the party of
the common people.
The poor and the marginalized.
The weak and defenseless."
Ok so you try to smear Dems for
embracing celebrity opinions, but
then use Kanye in your video.
Then you claim we shame people we 
don’t agree with, while also shaming
Kaepernick in the same video, a
celebrity you shamed because he
hurt your precious patriotic feelings.
Man, Selfownitis truly is a
conservative disease.
See ted cruz for reference.
And listen it’s not that we shame
anyone we disagree with, we just
disagree with things like
slavery was a choice that’s all.
"Democrats are the party of equality.
So much so that we insist upon
unconditionally believing woman
and disbelieving men.
Because well feminism."
Yeah, why believe women when a
measly 1 out of every 6 women in
America has been the victim of
an attempted or completed sexual assault.
I mean why listen to the voices of those 
who as of 1998 an estimated 17.7 million
have been victims of attempted
or completed rape.
I mean why it’s not like 82% of juvenile
victims are female, and 90% of
adult victims are female or anything.
No the real victim is men.
I mean if there’s one statistic you
should be concerned about is the
0.05% of false accusations.
Yeah, you wanna talk about
victims, what about the 0.05 %.
And while we are on the topic of
miniscule percentages being the
real victims, what about the 1%
- it’s not easy being that rich
you know, Especially with all
the tax cuts republicans are
fighting for, do you know how
hard it is to spend that amount
of money?
Yeah that’s the real issue.
Yacht or ferrari.
F**k it get em both.
"Republicans want to take away
a women sacred rights to chose
have her child decapitated within
her womb limb by limb with forceps.
Democrats celebrate the right
to violently kill your child because
we are compassionate."
Right because remember,
republicans are pro-life.
They care about kids so much
they seperate them from their
family and lock em in cages,
just for their own protection.
And not only this, they care so
much about kids that they sought
to cut funding to CHIP remember.
Yeah that measly $15 billion that they
sought to cut from the program
that seeks to help those kids
they fight for inside the womb,
if they happen to born with that
little pre-existing condition thing.
So it’s all lives matter until they are 
born, then it’s your on your own kid.
And just incase you forgot, it’s not 
just the unborn they care for, it’s
ALL lives remember.
That’s why they are doing everything they
can to protect all lives by helping the
22 million lives living in poverty by
helping them get affordable healthcare right?
It’s not like the majority of 
the country wants it or anything?
Oh you don’t want to do that either.
Ok so when you meant all lives matter 
you really meant everyone except
black lives, immigrant lives,
children's lives, any lives but
white conservative lives right?
Ok well I think that’s about
enough dismantling of
insufferable hypocrisy for today.
But i’m sure CRTV will be
back soon with some more
hilarity that will leaves us...
well thankful that the left
at least knows how to do humor at least.
Get wreck’d nerds.
