TO THAT CLEAR CONTRADICTION IN
TESTIMONY.
>> Martha: PETER KING,
CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
JOINING ME NOW IS JUDGE EVENT OF
-- FORMER INDEPENDENT CONSOLE.
AND A FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO
HILLARY CLINTON.
WELCOME, GENTLEMEN.
I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE
SOUND BITE FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP
WHEN HE SPOKE TO "FOX & FRIENDS"
LAST WEEK IN REGARDS TO THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
>> VERY DISAPPOINTED IN MY
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT'S
GOING ON AND I THINK YOU'LL
UNDERSTAND THIS, I HAVE DECIDED
THAT I WON'T BE INVOLVED.
I MAY CHANGE MY MIND AT SOME
POINT BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING ON IS
A DISGRACE.
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE.
>> Martha: WHAT DID YOU MAKE
OF THAT COMMENT?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS
FRUSTRATED.
AND HE SHOULD BE.
I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN,
MARTHA, APROPOS OF COMEY'S
COMMENTS AND CLAPPER IS A PARENT
LYING JOHN HUBER, WHO'S BEEN
SELECTED TO SHOW THE PFIZER
ILLEGALITY WILL BE INVESTIGATING
ALL THE THINGS THAT WE JUST
TALKED ABOUT.
THE GRAND JURY SUBPOENA WILL
ISSUE FROM MR. COMEY,
MR. CLAPPER, AND MR. BRENNAN.
PENDING THE GRAND JURY'S
APPEASER, I THINK MR. KLAPPER
AND MR. COMEY AND MR. BRENNAN
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CE
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CR
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CN
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CE
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CS
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CR
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CK
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CD
UNTIL THE GRAND JURY AND JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT MAKE DETERMINATIONS
ABOUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY.
THEIR CONDUCT FROM DISCLOSED
INVITATIONS
CONVERSATIONS VIOLATED THE
STANDARDS FOR MAINTAINING
SECURITY CLEARANCE AND THE
CURRENT DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE, DAN COATS, SHOULD
REVOKE ALL OF THEIR SECURITY
CLEARANCES PENDING THE GRAND
JURY OUTCOME.
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS.
FIRST, I AGREE WITH CONGRESSMAN
KING WHEN HE SAYS THIS IS A VERY
DARK PERIOD OF AMERICAN
INTELLIGENCE IN THE SENSE OF THE
LAST 15 MONTHS IT'S BEEN VERY
POLITICIZED.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR
AMERICA.
I WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST SAID.
HE SAID "MY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT."
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S KEY.
FOR 15 MONTHS NOW, HE HAS BEEN
PRESIDENT.
ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS IS AS
AN APPOINTEE THE DEPUTY GENERATE
-- THEY ARE ALL HIS APPOINTEES.
THE NOTION ON THE ONE HAND THAT
HE IS BEING PERSECUTED BY THEM,
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT MR.
MR. GENOVA BELIEVES AND BELIEVES
IS BEING FRAMED, AND IN OTHER
HAND HE'S IN CHARGE OF THE
PLACE, DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
IF IT WAS HILLARY CLINTON AS
PRESIDENT AND ME AS A
WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR AND CHELSEA
CLINTON AS ATTORNEY GENERAL, I'D
UNDERSTAND THE NOTION OF, LIKE,
THEY CAN'T BE FAIR, THEY ARE
PICKING ON ME.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT NOW.
>> Martha: JOE, WHAT DO YOU
SAY TO THAT?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S
FRUSTRATION STEMS FROM THE FACT
THAT THE APPOINTMENT OF
MR. MUELLER IN MY OPINION SHOULD
HAVE NEVER OCCURRED BECAUSE WHEN
MR. ROSENSTEIN APPOINTED HIM,
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A CRIME.
INDEED, HE MENTIONED NO CRIME IN
THE APPOINTMENT PAPERS.
I DO THINK WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN NOW IS THE PEOPLE AT THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS DOING
THEIR JOBS.
THEY SENT IT OUT TO MR. HUBER
WHO HAS WHAT THAT WILL BE THE
SINGLE MOST SINGLE INVESTIGATION
AT ALL.
I AGREE WITH PHILIPPE.
THOSE 15 MONTHS HAVE BEEN JUST
AWFUL.
I WILL TELL YOU THIS.
I THINK THE WORST PART OF AND
AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE AND
LAW ENFORCEMENT CAME JULY 5TH
2016 WHEN JAMES COMEY USURPED
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL.
THAT WAS THE DARKEST DAY IN
AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN 100
YEARS.
>> Martha: THAT IS WHAT THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL IS LOOKING
INTO IN TERMS OF THAT PART OF
THE INVESTIGATION.
I WANT TO ASK YOU BOTH A
QUESTION ABOUT THIS NOBEL PRIZE,
BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT THE
AWARD THAT CNN WAS GIVEN FOR
PUTTING THE STEELE DOSSIER INTO
THE LEXICON THE OTHER NIGHT.
THERE IS A SUGGESTION BY THE
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD WIN THE
NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.
THE ONLY THING WE NEED IS PEACE.
PHILIPPE, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?
HE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR
THAT.
>> HE COULD BE CONSIDERED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY -- I DO
GET A CHANCE TO SAY IT AGAIN
THAT I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH
JOE AND EVOLVE WHAT HE SAID
ABOUT JIM COMEY'S BEHAVIOR ON
JULY 6, 2016.
ON THE NOBEL, LOOK AT WHAT'S
HAPPENING WITH NORTH KOREA IS
IMPORTANT.
LET'S LET IT PLAY OUT.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS DOING
THIS FOR THE PRIZE.
>> Martha: IT'S CERTAINLY
JUMPING THE GUN, ANYBODY WOULD
SAY THAT.
IT CERTAINLY REMINDS PEOPLE OF
PERHAPS WHEN THE NOBEL COMMITTEE
JUMPED THE GUN AND GIVING ONE TO
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
HE THOUGHT IT WAS TOO SOON, BUT
HE SAID THEY GAVE IT TO HIM
BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO LOWER
THE TEMPERATURE IN TERMS OF
NUCLEAR WAR IN THE WORLD AND
JOE, IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT
IS MAKING SOME AT LEAST SOME
PROGRESS.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS CHANGED THE
PARADIGM AND HAS MADE GREAT
SUCCESS AND MOMENTUM RIGHT NOW
IN NORTH KOREA.
LET'S ALL KEEP OUR FINGERS
CROSSED.
NOTHING HAS BEEN FINALLY
ACCOMPLISHED, BUT I MUST SAY.
LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW, WE ARE
AT AN AMAZING SPOT IN THE
HISTORY OF THE RELATIONSHIP IS
BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA.
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S
AGGRESSIVE AGENDA.
>> Martha: IT WOULD BE PRETTY
HARD FOR THE COMMITTEE NOT TO
CONSIDER IT SINCE THE PRESIDENT
OF SOUTH KOREA IS THE ONE WHO IS
SUGGESTING THEY SHOULD.
THAT WILL BE INTERESTING TO
WATCH.
>> I'VE BEEN TO THE DMZ.
I VERY MUCH THINK HE WOULD ENJOY
IT.
THAT'S WHERE IT SHOULD BE.
>> Martha: I THINK THEY HAVE
