1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
I'm just going to speak from the heart
here what we have witnessed was a total

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,450
eclipse of the facts someone who came
out on stage and lied directly to the

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,289
American people and left things out that
he said in an attempt to rewrite history

4
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:20,760
especially when it comes to
Charlottesville he's unhinged it's

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,570
embarrassing and I don't mean for us the
media because he went after us but for

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,910
the country this is who we elected
president of the United States a man who

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,800
is so petty that he has to go after
people who he deems to be his enemy like

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,420
an imaginary friend of a six-year-old
his speech was without thought it was

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,010
without reason it was devoid of facts it
was devoid of wisdom there was no

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,539
gravitas there was no sanity there he
was like a child blaming a sibling on

11
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,989
something else he did it I didn't do it
he certainly opened up the race wound

12
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,030
from Charlottesville a man clearly
wounded by the rational people who are

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,290
abandoning him in droves meaning those
business people and the people in

14
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,790
Washington now who are questioning his
fitness for office and whether he is

15
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:16,080
stable a man backed into a corner it
seems by circumstances beyond his

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,909
control and beyond his understanding

17
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,840
that's the truth if you watch that
speech as an American you have to be

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,450
thinking what in the world is going on
this is the person we elected as a

19
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,700
president of the United States this
petty this small the person is supposed

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:00:00,000
to pull the country together certainly
didn't happen there
