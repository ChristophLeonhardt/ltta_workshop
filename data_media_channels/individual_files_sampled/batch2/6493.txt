now Ted Cruz was claiming to be a man of principle and when he was running from 2016 primaries he was furious at Donald Trump and understandably so trumpet called his father a murderer I made fun of his wife I'll get into that in a second he has changed his tune today in the most wonderfully humiliating defacing way I will get to that but first I want to remind you the context here and why Cruz was mad and what he had said about Donald Trump when they were running against each other in 2016 he had called Donald Trump quote utterly amoral he also called him a pathological liar he wasn't anywhere near done he said that Trump was a narcissist at a level I don't think this country has ever seen by the way all three of those quotes are the most correct things that Ted Cruz has ever said in his career those are all true and boy did he have a reason to be upset so here is what Trump had said about Rafael Cruz Ted Cruz's father Lee Harvey Oswald Oswald being you know is ridiculous but what is this right prior to his being shot what would he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald right before the shooting it's easy yeah it is crazy he was accusing the Senators father of murdering a president okay uh if somebody said that about my dad I don't think I'd kiss and make up and Cruz did as you're about to see in a minute and he kissed him in an interesting place so but I'm not done yet he also made fun Trump did of Ted Cruz's wife not only of his wife but of her looks he had threatened to spill the beans on her whatever that means in an earlier tweet and then he retweeted this where it said no need to spill the beans the images are worth a thousand words showing an unflattering picture of Senator Cruz's wife and a flattering one of Donald Trump's wife oh he's such AI unreal so what did Ted Cruz do today he wrote the essay praising Donald Trump for being named one of the most powerful people in Time magazine they have their annual issue of the hundred people that time in Asus celebrates and of all the people in the world I could have written that essay about Trump Cruz wrote it and listen to this sniveling politician here's what he says now President Trump is a flashbang grenade thrown into Washington by the Forgotten men and women of America the fact that his first year as commander-in-chief disoriented and distressed members of the media and political establishment is not a bug but a feature now all of a sudden praising Trump like he's some sort of hero representing the Forgotten men and women of America perhaps all the Forgotten women was your wife and one of the Forgotten men was your dad he's not done he says the same cultural safe spaces then blinkered coast elites to candidate Trump's popularity have rendered them blind to president Trump's achievements on behalf of ordinary Americans I don't remember you talking about his popularity during the campaign trail I remember you saying something else we're gonna get to that too in a sec but wait he's not done kissing Donald Trump's ass like the beta that he is all right while wealthy celebrities announced that they would flee the country he fought to bring back jobs and industries to our shores while talking has predicted armed again president Trump's strong stand against North Korea put Kim jong-un back on his heels is there any territory left on Trump's ass you have not covered yet pathetic doesn't begin to describe Ted Cruz now I want to remind you what Ted Cruz had said back on the campaign trail when I asked about his attacks on his family members here's video watch I don't get angry off but you mess with my wife you mess with my kids that'll do it every time Donald you're a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone so will you support him as the nominee I'm gonna beat them that never gets old yes never like coward I mean you are representing two forgotten men and women of America you're an American Hero oh you're so sad and when she asked that question was a great question by the reporter somebody wins he paused for so long because despite all the false bravado at the end he's a slimy slimy politician so he's like I don't know it depends on how it'll play out politically oh you're so sad and you were talking about sad I've got one more video for you after a threatening Donald Trump like that during the same campaign during the same campaign after he was beaten he got cooked like this watch hi this is Ted Cruz called I was calling to encourage you to come out and vote on Election Day this election is critical for the erection of our country's urge you to come out and support freedom the Constitution and the Bill of Rights come out thank you that is the most wonderfully sad video I have ever seen I'm not done with him yet let me show you my favorite picture of all time oh are you okay Ted what happened I thought you were gonna beat him I thought you were gonna take on the sniveling coward I thought you were gonna man up Ted this guy the first ad he ran in his new Senate campaign now because better or orcas come and get him I'm gonna tell you about that in a second the first ad he ran was talking about how real men in Texas act is that how they act you all right I'm not done so now let's go to the latest polls oh the poll from Quinnipiac University shows the two men or or can Ted Cruz in a dead heat 47% of registered voters in Texas support Cruz the Republican incumbent while 44% back or orc and El Paso Democrat that is within the margin of error of the poll now a lot of people are stunned by that we are not I predicted better O'Rourke's victory a long time ago and I'll tell you why not only is better Orkut really interesting politician he's very progressive he's running super strong he's powered by grassroots he doesn't take corporate PAC money and he's out raised Ted Cruz raised millions upon millions of dollars from small dollar donations but that's not the main reason why he's a great candidate but that's not the main reason the main reason is Ted Cruz has no spine he has no moral Center he has nothing a man like that is not gonna win an election an actual tough election I don't care how red they think Texas is against the real candidate and Beto is a real candidate Ted Cruz is gonna fold like he always does you want to see a picture of Ted Cruz this is it yeah I'm doing it again that's right Ted okay that's a picture of you folding and you're gonna fold again in this election and now here comes the best irony so Ted Cruz writes these fawning letters to Donald Trump praising him to no end and did the phone-banking for him now it turns out not only is it not going to help but it might actually hurt him in the state of Texas in his own election the poll had another ominous warning Texas Tribune reports for the GOP president Donald Trump was underwater in Texas with 52 percent of respondents disapproving of him and 43 percent approving of his job performance in other words sucking up to Donald Trump is counterproductive in Texas oh you're poor dumb son of a bitch now you want to know what Ted Cruz thinks of that poll here it is ah see you wouldn't wanna be you this guy is a loser through and through no way he wins that seat he will lose in epic historic fashion if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday
