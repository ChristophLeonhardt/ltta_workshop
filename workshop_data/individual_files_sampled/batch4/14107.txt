you know what I heard a report of someone just last week who was a Gavin McInnes fan I like Gavin he used to be on our channel then he was hired away by a much more deep pocketed network he has a sort of fraternity called proud boys and a proud boy was turned away from Canada just because of their affiliation with Gavin McInnes and I thought that's crazy that's dangerous that shows how Orwellian we are because there is no Islamic preacher who hasn't yet done the tour of Canada I think there's a 49 percent chance that you will be kept out of Canada on these I think there's a 49 percent chance I think it's I think it's just slightly more likely that you will be led into Canada than not and the reason I say that is this news I heard from last week that someone who merely hangs out with Gavin McInnes was banned from Canada for that reason and I know that sounds so shocking if the UK banned you from the United Kingdom it wouldn't surprise me if Canada used that as a precedent to ban you from here yeah I really think that we're losing our freedom Pamela yeah absolutely the UK banned me and in the first eight months 2017 there have been over 400 jihad terrorists arrests okay not defenders of freedom arrests a 400 Ching hai tera so how is that working out for the UK I wonder in addition I'd like to say the great irony here is that from Toronto from Toronto I have to dash to Boston to make a statement in the sentencing of the leader of a Muslim group who plotted to behead me I have to be at the sentencing of Darwin right who in a plot with two other co-religionists like plotted to behead me this is not the first assassination attempt but I'm the bad one hmm on the hunt and this is what is in my book you know you know me a long time I've never been personally I never talk about the personal side of the work you have to keep something for yourself you know you need a little neshama and but i thought it was time that that people understood this fight how it got to at how organically I got to our eight political I was before 9/11 and how I went from this you know fabulous New York City career girl to the world's top Islamophobe but that's what I'm called or the most notorious racist Islamophobic anti-muslim bigot in the country how did that happen simply because I stand in defense of freedom and I am but a proxy in it you know in this this terrible long war what happens to me what happened to me is what happens in large and small ways to any human being that stands in defense of freedom and if you think if any of your listeners think they can stand aside and watch like they watched during World War two from the streets you'll closely mistaken I may be the tip of the spear but it begins with me it doesn't end with me that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on youtube if you want to subscribe to watch The Daily Show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
