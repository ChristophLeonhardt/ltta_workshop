the Labour Party's having an identity crisis from its support for brexit or not as well as its love affair with the murderous state Palestine unfortunately the labor conference is now over damn but it's been a real show of disdain for the British people if you've been following it all I saw was sickening pandering to the far left by all these politicians that stood up there and all the other freaks who stood up on stage as well I saw ego trips betrayals the lot and let's start with Emily Thornberry shall we you'll remember her she was the snobby woman who took a swipe at the white van men on Twitter some time ago which she rightfully got in trouble over and she go up on stage and she tried to take this big grand stand against anti-semitism in the party so she got up on stage and she waved her arms around and she made a speech and sounded authoritative but it just didn't work because she looked a bit ridiculous if I'm honest and the applause she got from the audience in her grandstanding against anti-semitism doesn't prove that the party is an anti-semitic it just proves that they've got no idea how hateful their party's actually become the whole things I joke the hatreds was the Jewish people you see in the Labor Party at these pro-palestine events if you just look them up on YouTube you'll see what I'm talking about it's insane it's really astonishing and I'm not fooled by you emily Thorne Bri and in fact I'm not fooled by anyone in the labour party who tells me they're not anti-semitic this party well I've called it before it's the new nasty party it's a bunch of hateful anti-democratic fools and you're not tricking anybody the real nature of the Labour Party was made visible at this conference by the simple fact that there were no British Union flags in sight but the flags I did see are multiple occasions were Palestinian Flags filling up the room as people spoke waving passionately the pro-palestinian Flags it's quite amazing and speaker after speaker were greeted by these flags that represent a terrorist so-called state that kills children and murders innocent people they falsely claimed to be victims and use an army of far-left activists across the West to push a genocide 'el agenda make no mistake Hamas little rule who rule Palestine Palestine they want to exterminate Jews they explicitly set that out in their own constitution and the Labour Party is supporting this they're supporting a so called state that wants the Jewish people dead and they tell us that I deserve it ik amazing isn't it we're supposed to believe that our way the actions of the Weber Party are consistently putting the Jewish people in the UK in danger to the point where they want to leave Jewish Brits want to leave at this point and many of them I did a report recently about 40% of said that actually they probably leave the country if calling one and I believe them that see of flags the sea of Palestinian flag should tell you everything you need to know about the modern Labour Party in Jeremy Corbyn compounded by the lack of British flags and Labour's impending commitment to a remain brexit policy because that's coming Kirsten are basically confirmed that at the conference I hope that the vapor party will soon be shown up for what it really is the anti British movement that it really has become so it's only a matter of time before this ageing labour movement that's been warped and twisted by successive far-left leaders comes crashing down right if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
