“My name is Andrew Bujalski.
I’m the writer-director of
the movie "Support the Girls."
So, "Support the Girls"
is a movie that centers
on the character of Lisa,
played by the great Regina
Hall here, who is the general
manager of a highway-side,
as she calls it,
‘boobs, brews
and big screen" restaurant,
along the lines of Hooters.
There are many,
many of them now
that have kind of
descended from Hooters.
And throughout her
day in this movie,
she’s constantly having
to extinguish fires.
Everything that could
go wrong is going wrong,
some of it of her own making.
And you know part
of that’s managing
conflicts between the girls.
And in this scene, a
conflict with a customer
bubbles up, which is something
that I think is always
kind of under the surface.
There’s always that
fear that a customer’s
going to get out of line.
And occasionally it happens.
And so here, one of
her girls has just
told her that a
customer basically
told her she was fat.
And Lisa’s not quite sure
what "basically" means.
But it doesn’t really matter.
She’s got to go to
bat for her girl.
So here she goes.
As she walks, of course,
she’s observing everything.
She sees another
potential situation
there — inappropriate
contact that she’ll
have to come back to.
But now she’s got to focus
on confronting this guy,
this biker gentleman — "
“Excuse me, sir." "Yeah."
"My name is Lisa,
I'm the general manager and
my girl just said you
got a little disrespectful with her."
And the actor here is a
guy named Pete Partida.
He’s a Texas actor.
And we saw a lot of
folks for this part, but
I was very excited about him
because he got at something
that I thought was important
for this character.
A lot of people
wanted, I think,
to play him as a kind
of raging villain.
And that wasn’t right for him.
I needed a guy who
felt genuinely wronged
in the situation, who’d
get across that sense
of aggrievement.
"I am done asking you nicely."
"You marching today?"
"Get your ass up, and
go eat somewhere else."
"I heard you the first time.
So now what are you gonna do?"
And Regina stood her
ground, as she had to.
And it all ends
pretty painfully.
But it’s Lisa’s job to
make everything right
in this place.
And so as he walks
out the door,
she’s being the
den mother again
and trying to bring order back
to a chaotic restaurant."
