IT'S CLEAR THAT THE PAST SET OF EFFORTS HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED. I'M A BELIEVER IN DIPLOMACY. AND I'M OPEN TO NEW METHODS OF TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THE CONSISTENT OBJECTIVE THAT WE HAVE OF FULL DENUCLEARIZATION. I THINK THE QUESTION IS ARE WE WALKED IN PREPARED? ARE WE WALKING IN WITH OUR ALLIES BEHIND US? ARE WE IN A POSITION TO UNDERSTAND THAT ONE MEETING IS NOT GOING TO BE ONE AND DONE, THIS IS THE START OF A SERIOUS NEGOTIATING PROCESS. BRET: FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR SUSAN RICE TALKING ABOUT THIS UP COMING SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN, BOTH LEADERS TRAVELING A LONG DISTANCE. OBVIOUSLY COMING FROM CANADA, THE G-7 SUMMIT, THE PRESIDENT DID, BUT WASHINGTON, D.C. TO SINGAPORE HERE AND PYONGYANG. THIS IS THE FARTHEST THAT KIM JONG-UN HAS TRAVELED SINCE TAKING POWER IN 2011. NO SITTING PRESIDENT HAS MET WITH A LEADER AS FAR AS WE KNOW, A NORTH KOREAN LEADER OR SPOKEN TO ONE ON THE PHONE AS FAR AS WE KNOW. WHAT ABOUT THE EXPECTATIONS HERE? WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES? LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL FROM D.C. MOLLY HEMMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST, SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF AT USA TODAY. AND TOM ROGAN, COMMENTARY WRITER FOR THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER. TOM, I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF SAYING THIS COULD BE THE FIRST OF SEVERAL SUMMITS. WHAT ARE YOU THOUGHTS HEADING INTO TUESDAY? WELL, THE FIRST THING I THINK THAT IS CLEAR NOW THAT THIS PROGRESSIVE STEP PROCESS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS IN PARTICULAR WANTED WILL BE THE CASE. BUT I THINK ON THE PART OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, ESPECIALLY PUSHING THIS NARRATIVE BY SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO BOTH OUTSIDE AND BESIGNED THE SCENE BEHIND THE SCENES, NEED TO HAVE SOME TANGIBLE PRODUCT BEHIND THIS SUMMIT. I THINK WHAT WILL BE SOME KIND OF LIMITED INSPECTION PRESENCE FROM THE IAEA IN NORTH KOREA FOLLOWING THE SUMMIT. HOW INTRUSIVE IS THAT? DOES IT INVOLVE SNAP INSPECTIONS? PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NEED A DELIVERABLE THAT HE CAN SAY WELL, LOOK, THERE'S SOMETHING TANGIBLE HERE WHICH MEANS THIS PROCESS MUST GO ON. BRET: YEAH. SUSAN? YOU KNOW, I THINK THE ISSUE IS NOT ONLY WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS AGREE TO DO BUT WHAT THE U.S. GIVES UP TO ACHIEVE SOME KIND OF DELIVERABLE, SOMETHING SO PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN SAY IT IS A SUCCESS. WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN UP QUITE A BIT. WE HAVE GIVEN THIS MEETING WHICH THE NORTH KOREANS WANTED. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE PICTURE WHICH THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE WANTED OF THE TWO LEADERS SHAKING HANDS AS EQUALS. SO I THINK ONE CONCERN THAT SOME HAVE IS THAT THE UNITED STATES NOT GIVE MORE GROUND ON THINGS WITHOUT THE NORTH KOREANS TAKING TANGIBLE STEPS THAT ACTUALLY LEAD TO A REDUCTION OF THE NUCLEAR THREAT. ONE THING, MOLLY, THAT THE PRESIDENT SAID ON FRIDAY BEFORE LEAVING WAS THAT HE REALLY WANTS CONGRESS IN THIS WHOLE THING. TAKE A LISTEN. I WOULD ONLY DO A DEAL IF I GET IT THROUGH CONGRESS. I WOULDN'T DO LIKE OBAMA DID AND HE WASN'T ABLE TO GET IT THROUGH. HE TRIED TO GET IT THROUGH, THE IRAN DEAL, HE TRIED TO GET IT THROUGH CONGRESS, FAILED SO HE JUST DID IT WITHOUT WHICH IS WHY I WAS ABLE TO BREAK IT UP SO EASY. SO I MEAN, ADDING TO THE CHALLENGES HERE, THE CHALLENGE TO GET TO GET CONGRESS TO GET AN ACTUAL TREATY THROUGH. IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAILURE TO SEAL HIS IRAN DEAL WITH CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL SEALED THE FATE OF THAT DEAL. IT IS VERY EASY TO CHANGE THINGS IF YOU DON'T HAVE TREATIED RATIFIED BY THE SENATE. TREATIES RATIFIED BY THE SENATE. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE SENATE BE ON BOARD AND THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BE ON BOARD, UNDERSTAND FULLY WHAT WE ARE GIVING IN EXCHANGE FOR DENUCLEARIZATION IF THAT IS WHAT IS ON THE TABLE. IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET SOME INDICATION RIGHT AWAY THAT NORTH KOREA IS SERIOUS. THEY HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF PROMISING GRANDIOSE THINGS AND FAILING TO FAILING TO COMPLY WITH WHAT THEY HAVE PROMISED AFTER THEY GET THE GOODS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. I DON'T THINK THE AMERICANS ARE INTERESTED IN THAT KIND OF AGREEMENT THIS TIME AROUND. YOU ASK AMERICANS ABOUT IT, AND WE TOOK A POLL, A FOX NEWS POLL RECENTLY AND YOU ASK THEM ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES, WILL NORTH KOREA EVER GIVE UP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS? 28% SAY NOW YES. 60% SAY NO. AND YOU CAN SEE KIND OF THE CHANGE FROM MARCH OF 2018. THE OTHER QUESTION WAS, WHO WOULD GET THE BETTER DEAL? AND MOST PEOPLE NOW, 40% SAY DONALD TRUMP WOULD GET THE BETTER DEAL, KIM JONG-UN 30%. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT BEHIND THE SCENES IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS, TOM, BUT THE FIRST MEETING IS GOING TO BE WITH THE TWO LEADERS AND JUST TRANSLATORS. NOBODY ELSE. YES, EXACTLY. AND YOU KNOW, APART FROM THE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE NORTH KOREAN AND SECURITY SERVICE AND THE SECRET SERVICE, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE BASELINE HERE WILL BE PRESIDENT TRUMP TESTING KIM JONG-UN AS TO WHAT HE CAN GET OUT OF IT. AND THE CRITICAL FACTOR AS WELL IS NOT JUST THE SUMMIT AND WHAT FOLLOWS IT BUT HOW EXTERNAL ACTORS REACT TO IT AS WELL, SPECIFICALLY THE CHINESE AND THE RUSSIANS. WE ALREADY SEE SOMEONE I HAVE TALKED TO WHO HAS BEEN IN NORTH KOREA RECENTLY MENTIONED THAT THE ACTUAL FLOW OF GOODS ACROSS THAT BORDER HAS SIGNIFICANTLY UP TICKED AS THE SUMMIT HAS PROGRESSED TO ITS ARRIVAL, AND SO FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO RETAIN THAT PRESSURE ALONGSIDE LITTLE CONCESSIONS AND LITTLE GAINS WILL BE A DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT BECAUSE OF COURSE IF THE CHINESE ARE ABLE TO DOUBLE DOWN THEIR SUPPORT FOR KIM JONG-UN IS INCENTIVE TO JUST PLAY THIS OUT AND BEHIND THE SCENES DEVELOP THE WAR HEAD VEHICLE THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS HERE. MIKE POMPEO AS THE LEAD CIA DIRECTOR, HE HAS THE PRESIDENT'S TRUST AND ALSO HAS AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. BRET: SUSAN, I HAVE HEARD ANECDOTALLY THAT KIM JONG-UN HAS EXPRESSED A NEED AND A WANT FOR INVESTMENT IN THIS COUNTRY, IN NORTH KOREA. AND EVEN HOTELS ALONG THE COASTLINE AND HAS KIND OF MUSED ABOUT THAT IN MEETINGS. THE QUESTION IS, IS GETTING FROM ONE POINT TO THE NEXT? YEAH, HAVING A McDONALD'S IN DOWNTOWN PYONGYANG THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING PERHAPS HE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN. WELL, I THINK WE'RE COUNTING ON THAT. I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP TALK ABOUT WHY NORTH KOREA MAY BE WILLING TO GIVE UP ITS NUKES AND THERE'S A LOT OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT THAT, IT IS BECAUSE IT COULD DRAW THE KIND OF INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR THEIR PEOPLE. MOLLY MADE A GOOD POINT WHICH IS THAT NORTH KOREA HAS A HISTORY OF OF NO OF NOT OF NOT K OF NOT KEE OF NOT KEEPI OF NOT KEEPING OF NOT KEEPING W OF NOT KEEPING WIT OF NOT KEEPING WITH OF NOT KEEPING WITH I OF NOT KEEPING WITH ITS OF NOT KEEPING WITH ITS D OF NOT KEEPING WITH ITS DEA OF NOT KEEPING WITH ITS DEALS OF NOT KEEPING WITH ITS DEALS. I WILL BE CURIOUS TO SEE IF IT RAISES ANY QUESTIONS ACROSS THE TABLE, ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN COUNT ON THE UNITED STATES TO LIVE UP TO A DEAL THAT'S REACHED. BRET: AS I MENTIONED WITH THE PREVIOUS GROUP HERE IN SINGAPORE, MOLLY, IT SENDS TWO SIGNALS, ONE, MAYBE HE'S NOT GOING TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON SOME KUHN KUH COMMUNIQUE, BUT TWO HE WOULD GET UP FROM THE TABLE IF IT'S NOT THE DEAL AND LISTEN TO SOME LEADER SAY SOMETHING HE DOESN'T LIKE. FIRST OFF OUR CONSTITUTION PROVIDES A MEANS TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO FEEL CONFIDENT ON HOW WE HAVE COME TO A DECISION. THAT DOES INVOLVE RATIFICATION BY THE SENATE. THAT'S A NORM THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN BREACHED BY PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY WORKS WELL AND IT IS ALREADY IN OUR SYSTEM. IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT DONALD TRUMP BEHAVES IN A VERY UNPRECEDENTED MANNER. HE DOES NOT SEEM TO THINK THAT THE GLOBAL ORDER AS ORCHESTRATED BY OTHERS FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES IS NECESSARILY GOOD. WE SEE IN NORTH KOREA IT HAS NOT WORKED OUT WELL FOR MANY DECADES. THAT CROSSES PARTY LINES AND MANY ADMINISTRATIONS, SO HE IS LOOKING TO DO SOMETHING
