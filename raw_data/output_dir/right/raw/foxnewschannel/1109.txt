1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,891
FROM 105 DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP.

2
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:08,560
A BUSY NEWS DAY IN TONIGHT'S

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,131
IMPORTANT OPENING MONOLOGUE.

4
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:15,600
NBC NEW REPORTING THAT MICHAEL

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,237
HOROWITZ IS COMING OUT STRONG

6
00:00:19,237 --> 00:00:22,274
AGENDA JAMES COMEY, ANDREW

7
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:24,442
McCABE AND LORETTA LYNCH.

8
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,645
EXAMINING HOW THEY MISHANDLED

9
00:00:26,645 --> 00:00:28,880
THE 2016 CRIMINAL CASE TO

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,347
HILLARY CLINTON.

11
00:00:29,347 --> 00:00:31,416
WE WERE RIGHT AND YOUR MEDIA WAS

12
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:31,983
WRONG.

13
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:32,683
JAMES COMEY CLEARED HILLARY

14
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:35,520
CLINTON OF ALL CHARGES BUT NOT

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,291
BEFORE MANY MISDEEDS SURROUNDING

16
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,525
THE INVESTIGATION.

17
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,260
ONE SOURCE TOLD ABC THAT THE

18
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:50,635
DRAFT REPORT USES THE WORDS

19
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:54,873
INSUBORDINATE TO DESCRIBE

20
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:55,941
COMEY'S BEHAVIOR.

21
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:59,010
NONE OF THIS IS SURPRISING.

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,581
THE McCABE REPORT CAME OUT AND

23
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:03,982
THEN THE CRIMINAL REFERRAL.

24
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:06,785
WE KNOW ABOUT LORETTA LYNCH'S

25
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:09,054
TARMAC MEETING WITH BILL CLINTON

26
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:10,755
BEFORE SHE HELPED CLEAR HIS WIFE

27
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:12,591
OF ALL OF THESE CHARGES.

28
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:15,927
WE KNOW ABOUT McCABE'S

29
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:17,596
DEMOCRATIC TIES AND LYING.

30
00:01:17,596 --> 00:01:19,698
HILLARY CLINTON DID COMMIT

31
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:20,065
FELONIES.

32
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:21,766
SHE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE.

33
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:24,202
THAT'S INDISPUTABLE AT THIS

34
00:01:24,202 --> 00:01:24,736
POINT.

35
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,239
ANDREW McCABE IS NOW REQUESTING

36
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:33,144
IMMUNITY FROM THE U.S. SENATE IN

37
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:34,846
EXCHANGE AGAINST HIS FORMER BOSS

38
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:35,247
JAMES COMEY.

39
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:36,681
THE FULL REPORT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

40
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:37,983
RELEASED BY NOW.

41
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:39,884
FRANKLY, IF IT'S RELEASED

42
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:40,885
BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT

43
00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:42,520
WEDNESDAY -- THE SUMMIT ON

44
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,023
TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK -- THAT

45
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:47,025
MEAN THEY ARE TRYING TO BURY

46
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,294
THIS ON A SUMMER WEEKEND SO IT

47
00:01:49,294 --> 00:01:50,962
DOESN'T GET THE COVERAGE IT

48
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:51,496
NORMALLY WOULD.

49
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:53,431
IF THEY WILL RELEASE IT EARLY

50
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:56,501
NEXT WEEK THEY ARE TRYING TO

51
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:58,169
BURY IT DURING THE SINGAPORE

52
00:01:58,169 --> 00:01:58,503
SUMMIT.

53
00:01:58,503 --> 00:02:01,539
WHAT YOU DESERVE IS JUSTICE IN

54
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,508
THE FORM OF CRIMINAL REFERRALS

55
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:06,044
FOR EVERYBODY WE JUST MENTIONED.

56
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,280
18 LONG MONTHS AND MR

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,547
OBSTRUCTION HIMSELF OF CONGRESS,

58
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,983
ROB ROSENSTEIN, HE'S HAD THIS

59
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:13,118
REPORT FOR 2 WEEKS ALREADY.

60
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:15,387
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT HE IS

61
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:18,723
TRYING TO GET CHANGED OR

62
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:19,958
REDACTED.

63
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:24,896
CATHERINE HAS A NEW REPORT.

64
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,500
REMEMBER PETER STRZOK DEMOTED

65
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,870
AFTER HIS ANTI-TRUMP TEXTS WERE

66
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,871
AVAILABLE.

67
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:34,306
CATHERINE REPORTS HE WAS THE

68
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:36,474
LEAD INVESTIGATOR IN THE CLINTON

69
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:36,775
CASE.

70
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:39,344
HE HATED TRUMP AND WANTED THE

71
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:41,946
INSURANCE POLICY.

72
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:44,282
HE MOVED ON TO THE RUSSIA

73
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:46,151
COLLUSION CASE AND PUT ON

74
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:50,789
MUELLER'S WITCH HUNT TEAM.

75
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:54,125
THIS TRUMP HATING FBI AGENT

76
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,794
PLAYING A LEAD ROLE IN

77
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:57,329
EVERYTHING.

78
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,363
CLEARING HILLARY CLINTON AND

79
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:00,598
TAPPED TO INVESTIGATE DONALD

80
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:00,899
TRUMP.

81
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:02,200
ONE MORE REASON THE INSPECTOR

82
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,034
GENERAL'S REPORT SHOULD HAVE

83
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:05,203
BEEN RELEASED BY NOW.

84
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:06,504
AS THE MUELLER WITCH HUNT TURNS

85
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:07,539
ON THE SPECIAL.

86
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,541
THEY ARE DEMANDING THAT

87
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,143
WITNESSES TURN IN THEIR PHONES

88
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:17,215
SO TEAM MUELLER AND HIS PIT BULL

89
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:18,817
WEISSMAN AND RAY WHO WORKED FOR

90
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:22,387
CLINTON GET TO REVIEW ALL OF

91
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:25,490
THEIR ELECTRONIC DEVICES

92
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:25,957
COMMUNICATIONS.

93
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:35,600
EVEN TEXT ON ENCRYPTED APS.

94
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,271
IF THEY FOLLOW HILLARY CLINTON'S

95
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,074
LEAD DELETE ALL OF YOUR EMAILS

96
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:47,045
AND ACID WATCH YOUR HARD DRIVE

97
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:48,880
AND THEN BASH THEM TO PIECES AND

98
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,715
HAND THE PIECES OVER TO ROBERT

99
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:54,486
MUELLER AND SAY HILLARY CLINTON,

100
00:03:54,486 --> 00:03:57,455
THIS IS EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE

101
00:03:57,455 --> 00:03:57,822
LAW.

102
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,758
HOW WOULD THAT WORK FOR

103
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:01,326
EVERYBODY MUELLER IS DEMANDING

104
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:02,394
THEIR PHONES?

105
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:04,195
THE PERSON IN CHALLENGE OF THE

106
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:06,331
MUELLER WITCH HUNT, THE

107
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:07,766
DEPARTMENT AG, ROB ROSENSTEIN

108
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:10,068
RESPONDED TO GROWING CALLS FOR

109
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:12,937
HIS RECUSAL.

110
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:16,173
WRITING A LETTER TO SENATOR

111
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,242
LINDSEY GRAHAM.

112
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:19,244
HE RECOMMENDED COMEY'S FIRING.

113
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:22,547
HE SIGNED OFF ON THE FINAL FISA

114
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:24,883
WARRANT BASED ON HILLARY

115
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:27,986
CLINTON'S BOUGHT AND PAID FOR

116
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:28,787
DOSSIER THAT CHRISTOPHER STEELE

117
00:04:28,787 --> 00:04:29,921
SAID MAYBE 50-50.

118
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,656
GIVEN THAT ROSENSTEIN IS

119
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:32,690
OVERSEEING AN INVESTIGATION

120
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,626
WHERE HE IS A KEY WITNESS AND

121
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:36,628
SIGNED OFF ON THE FISA, I THINK

122
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:38,096
IT'S DEEM INAPPROPRIATE A LONG

123
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:39,197
TIME AGO.

124
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:41,900
EARLIER TODAY.

125
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,235
FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR AND

126
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:48,773
CURRENT TRUMP ATTORNEY RUDY

127
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:51,142
GIULIANI HAD STRONG WORDS ABOUT

128
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:53,745
TRYING TO UNDO THE ELECTION OF

129
00:04:53,745 --> 00:04:54,946
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

130
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:55,480
WATCH WHAT HE SAID.

131
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:02,620
>> THEY ARE A GROUP OF 13 HIGHLY

132
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,823
PARTISAN DEMOCRATS THAT MAKEUP

133
00:05:04,823 --> 00:05:06,758
THE MUELLER TEAM AND TRYING VERY

134
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:09,294
HARD TO FRAME HIM AND GET HIM IN

135
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:11,429
TROUBLE WHEN HE HASN'T DONE

136
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:12,130
ANYTHING WRONG.

137
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,565
THEY MAY NOT REALIZE THEY ARE

138
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:14,833
DOING IT.

139
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,601
THEY CAN'T COME TO THE GRIPS TO

140
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:19,771
THE FACT OF THE WHOLE THING OF

141
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:21,105
RUSSIAN COLLUSION IS NOT HAPPEN.

142
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:27,078
THEY ARE TRYING TO INVENT

143
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:28,213
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

144
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:29,447
THE PRESIDENT FIRED THE FBI

145
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:31,950
DIRECTOR AND HE SAID HAVE FIRED

146
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,217
HIM.

147
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:34,519
HE WAS A TERRIBLE FBI DIRECTOR.

148
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,620
>> Tucker: EVEN COMEY SAID HE

149
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,322
HAD THE RIGHT TO FIRE HIM.

150
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:40,325
BAD NEWS FOR THE TRUMP HATING

151
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:41,459
MAINSTREAM MEDIA.

152
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:44,128
THEIR CONSPIRACY THEORYS ABOUT

153
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:45,530
OUR FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP

154
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,265

AT AN EVENT IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

158
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:55,139
TAKE A LOOK.

159
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,210

00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,945
MAYBE SAY AND PAY RESPECTS TO

161
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:01,946
SOME OF THE PEOPLE HERE.

162
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:03,214
I HAVE A LIST.

163
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:06,918
WE HAVE TO START WITH OUR GREAT

00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:08,319

165
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:08,686
THANK YOU.

166
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:13,925
>> [APPLAUDING].

167
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,027
>> SHE WENT THROUGH A ROUGH

168
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:17,295
PATCH, BUT HE IS DOING GREAT.

169
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:18,563
WE ARE PROUD OF HER.

170
00:06:18,563 --> 00:06:19,998
DONE A FANTASTIC JOB AS FIRST

171
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:20,298
LADY.

172
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:21,833
THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY LOVE

174
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:25,203
THANK YOU, HONEY.

175
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:28,106
>> Tucker: GLAD SHE IS HEALTHY

176
00:06:28,106 --> 00:06:29,908
AND HER APPROVAL RATINGS ARE

177
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:32,844
HIGHER THAN THE PRESIDENT.

178
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:34,512
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED TODAY.

179
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:36,748
THAT THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA HAS

180
00:06:36,748 --> 00:06:41,085
BEEN SO VICIOUS TO MY WIFE, OUR

181
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:43,321
GREAT FIRST LADY MELANIA.

182
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,889
THEY REPORTED EVERYTHING FROM

183
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,759
NEAR DEATH TO FACELIFTS TO SHE

184
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,428
LEFT ME TO ABUSE.

185
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:51,029
ALL FAKE.

186
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:52,997
SHE IS DOING WELL.

187
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:55,400
KIMBERLIED.

188
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,134
-- KIM KARDASHIAN.

189
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:58,269
SHE VISITED THE OVAL OFFICE TO

190
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:02,106

BACK LASH FROM DEMOCRATS OVER

226
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,987
HIS LONG HISTORY OF SEXUAL ABUSE

227
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:25,289
AND MISCONDUCT.

228
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:26,758
DEMOCRATS IN THE MEDIA PROTECTED

229
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:30,495
THE CLINTONS THROUGH THE LAST

230
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:33,731
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN UNTIL

231
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:39,337
NOVEMBER 9th, 2016 THE DAY AFTER

232
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:40,705
HILLARY CLINTON LOST.

233
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:43,474
>> DO YOU FEEL MORE

234
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:43,941
RESPONSIBILITY?

235
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,877
>> NO, I FELT TERRIBLE THEN.

236
00:08:45,877 --> 00:08:49,147
I CAME TO GRIPS WITH IT.

237
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:52,450
>> DID YOU EVER APOLOGIZE?

238
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:52,784
>> YES.

239
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:54,052
>> NOBODY BELIEVES I GOT OUT OF

240
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:55,019
THAT FREE.

241
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,121
I LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE $16

242
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:02,994
MILLION IN DEBT.

243
00:09:02,994 --> 00:09:06,397
BUT YOU TYPICALLY HAVE IGNORED

244
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:10,268
GAPING FACTS AND I BET YOU DON'T

245
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:13,204
EVEN KNOW THEM.

246
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:13,671
APOLOGY?

247
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:14,238
>> I DO.

248
00:09:14,238 --> 00:09:16,340
I NEVER TALKED TO HER.

249
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,477
BUT I DID SAY PUBLICY ON MORE

250
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,245
THAN ONE OCCASION I WAS SORRY.

251
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:24,716
I GUILT WITH IT 20 YEARS PLUS.

252
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:28,453
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE STAYED WITH

253
00:09:28,453 --> 00:09:30,555
ME.

254
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:35,193
I TRIED TO DO A GOOD JOB SINCE

255
00:09:35,193 --> 00:09:40,932
THEN WITH MY LIFE AND WORK.

256
00:09:40,932 --> 00:09:42,633
>> Sean: BILL CLINTON TRASHED

257
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,669
THEM FOR ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS.

258
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:46,337
THEY FIRED BACK.

259
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:47,939
TAKE A LOOK.

260
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:49,807
>> THE FORMER BILL CLINTON

261
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:52,210
EXPRESSING SOME REGRET OVER HIS

262
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,913
REMARKS ABOUT MONICA LEWINSKY

263
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:58,549
HERE ON "TODAY."

264
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:03,020
MAKING FALSE ALLEGATIONS.

265
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,257
>> HE SAID HIS INTERVIEW WAS NOT

266
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:09,627
HIS FINEST HOUR.

267
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:11,829
MR. CLINTON MADE ANOTHER PUBLIC

268
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:14,565
APOLOGY BUT TOOK ISSUES WITH THE

269
00:10:14,565 --> 00:10:16,467
QUESTIONS WE ASKED HIM.

270
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:19,036
>> THE TAPE SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF.

271
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:23,307
YOU DID NOT ASSERT THAT HE NEVER

272
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:23,708
APOLOGIZED.

273
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,076
>> Sean: THE REST OF THE MEDIA

274
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:27,311
IS 30 YEARS TOO LATE.

275
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:28,780
THEY GAVE BILL CLINTON A TOTAL

276
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,149
PASS UNTIL HIS WIFE LOST THE

277
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:32,083
ELECTION.

278
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,887
ON "HANNITY" WE CALLED OUT

279
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:38,489
CLINTON ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT

280
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:40,658
BEFORE THE LEFT CARED ABOUT HIS

281
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:41,058
MISCONDUCT.

282
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,293
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THIS.

283
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:44,128
>> YOU DESCRIBED A SEEN WHERE HE

284
00:10:44,128 --> 00:10:45,663
WAS BITING ON YOUR LIP.

285
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:49,367
WHEN IT WAS OVER, HE WAS

286
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,769
LEAVING.

287
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:54,172
HE SAID YOU BETTER PUT SOME ICE

288
00:10:54,172 --> 00:10:54,672
ON THAT.

289
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:57,008
>> AND CASUALLY PUT ON HIS

290
00:10:57,008 --> 00:10:59,911
SUNGLASSES AND WALKED OUT THE

291
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:00,211
DOOR.

292
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:02,947
>> IT WAS A TERRIBLE ORDEAL.

293
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:05,883
IT WAS AN ASSAULT.

294
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:09,053
>> HE ASSAULTED YOU AGAINST YOUR

295
00:11:09,053 --> 00:11:09,353
WILL?

296
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:09,687
>> YES.

297
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,656
>> IT'S AN ALLEGATION THAT IS

298
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:14,225
NOT MADE BY ONE WOMAN BUT

299
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:14,592
MULTIPLE.

300
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:15,526
>> MANY OF US.

301
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:18,663
HE SAID I MAY NEED TO BE GOING.

302
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:21,399
HE SAT DOWN AND PULLED DOWN HIS

303
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:21,799
PANTS.

304
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,134
HIS WHOLE EVERYTHING.

305
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:24,302
HE WAS EXPOSED.

306
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:26,871
I SAID I AM NOT THAT KIND OF

307
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:27,205
GIRL.

308
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:31,275
I NEED TO GET BACK TO MY DESK.

309
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,310
>> Sean: THAT WAS ONE OF THE

310
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,414
HARDEST INTERVIEWS I HAVE DONE

311
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:39,984
IN 23.5 YEARS HERE AT FOX.

312
00:11:39,984 --> 00:11:43,955
WE WILL NEVER BE THE MAINSTREAM

313
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:44,255
MEDIA.

314
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,991
WE COVER THE STORIES THEY REFUSE

315
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:49,393
TO BECAUSE THEY ARE SO AGENDA

316
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:50,094
DRIVEN.

317
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:51,696
THESE ARE ISSUES THAT SHOULD

318
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:53,064
TRANSCEND POLITICS.

319
00:11:53,064 --> 00:11:54,732
ANOTHER AMAZING PIECE OF

320
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:55,466
ECONOMIC NEWS.

321
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,801
PERHAPS THE BEST EVER.

322
00:11:56,801 --> 00:12:00,571
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE

323
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,306
STATS STARTED RECORDING, THE

324
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,609
UNITED STATES HAS MORE JOBS

325
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:06,143
TODAY THAN JOBLESS CLAIMS.

326
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:06,844
GET THAT.

327
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:09,780
MORE JOBS AVAILABLE THAN WE HAVE

328
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,982
PEOPLE ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT

329
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:11,282
LINES.

330
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:14,552
WE HAVE 14 STATES TODAY WITH

331
00:12:14,552 --> 00:12:16,254
RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS

332
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:17,989
AND FOR WOMEN AND

333
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:20,491
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC

334
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:20,892
AMERICANS.

335
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:21,926
IF IT WAS THE OBAMA

336
00:12:21,926 --> 00:12:24,095
ADMINISTRATION, CHRIS MATTHEWS

337
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:26,364
WOULD HAVE A LOT OF THRILLS

338
00:12:26,364 --> 00:00:00,000
RUNNING UP AND DOWN HIS LEGS
