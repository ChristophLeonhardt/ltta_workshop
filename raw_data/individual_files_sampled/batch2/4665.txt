a video is surfaced of judge Cavanaugh from a speech he gave at the Columbus School of Law at Catholic University it's dated March 30th 2015 and it shows him saying this to the people in attendance we had good saying that we've held firm to to the to this day as the Dean was reminding me before before the talk which is what happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep that's been a good thing for all of us by joining me I was Jennifer mascot she's a former law clerk to judge Cavanaugh she testified as a witness during Cavanaugh's confirmation hearings less than two weeks ago she's known him and his family for 12 years Jennifer thank you for joining us your experience with Brett Kavanaugh stands in stark contrast to these allegations that you've heard well thank you so much for having me on yes i clerked for judge Kavanagh his first year on the DC circuit from 2006 to 2007 as you've mentioned I've known him and his family for 12 years and I have to tell you that every moment that I have interacted with him known his family worked closely side-by-side as a law clerk to the judge has has acted with absolute integrity and character he's been selfless he's been fair-minded he's been transparent that's the approach that he's brought to the cases that he decided every one the year that I worked with him he's remained a mentor a career-long friend someone that I deeply respect and I'm honored to know and throughout the confirmation process has had many statements of support from people of all walks of life all along the spectrum you saw many of them testify the day that I did that Friday at the Senate hearings and and and I of course strongly support Judge Cavanaugh have learned a lot from him and respect him a great deal so statements of support and character references are definitely important at a time like this how do you sort of hold that in your head at the same time as this woman dr. Blasi Ford who has come forward with an allegation how do you how do you square those well this is obviously a really tough set of circumstances and as many have said everyone deserves should be treated with respect and dignity and heard concerns you know of course I can tell you only what I know for and and who I know firsthand is judge Cavanaugh and I can tell you that in my experience with judge Cavanaugh knowing him and his family for 12 years he's always acted with the utmost character and integrity um it sounds like the Senate has made a decision about what it wants to do to proceed to hear from everyone and they have hearings on Monday and I know that Judge Cavanaugh looks forward to that opportunity gets a chance to clear his name he's didn't flatly denied the allegations they are they are flatly inconsistent with what I know of him and speaking first hand to that relationship for 12 years I found him to be a tremendous public servant during that time as someone though who has clerked in the system and really has a real keen view and an eye to what the justice to you know justice in the institutions of justice in this country have to do in order to uphold people's civil liberties and their their legal rights what do you think the best ways to deal with something like this when an allegation comes in late in the process we've embraced the idea that we we need to listen to victims we need to not denigrate their their allegations and at the same time be fair to those who are accused how do you see this unfolding in the way that's most fair well as you've mentioned you know the process so far in a lot of ways has been quite extensive I mean I think the total was maybe more than 30 hours of hearings that Judge Cavanaugh had before the Senate Judiciary Committee and had one-on-one meetings with senators had a closed-door meeting where their opportunities to ask him questions and he's he's he's answered those been able to share during that time his background has experienced his his his qualifications his approach to the law you know unfortunately as you mentioned you know the things and concerns have been raised now after all of that process and it sounds like the Senate has decided that that it believes the best way to move forward is a hearing on Monday judge Kavanaugh said he will be there flatly denies the allegations and wants to clear his name Jennifer mascotte thank you for joining us Jennifer mascot was a former clerk to Brett Kavanaugh on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
