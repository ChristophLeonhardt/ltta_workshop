democratic best discoverability of

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,390
content ecosystem if you will on the web

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,100
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is basically a huge</font>

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">website but you're not employing any</font>

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">journalists there or content creators</font>

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,700
you're paying everybody as a freelancer

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,340
it's all coming into one system how do

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,750
people find the content how's it

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,370
organized you have editors yeah

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely we have all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the above so</font>

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,910
of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> three hundred thousand</font>

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,410
individuals when I look at sort of our

24
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,750
site in our business the<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of</font>

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,909
those people the users actually are

26
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,830
coming through natural search so about

27
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,479
ninety percent of our traffic is natural

28
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,549
search so we create content that's very

29
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,380
discoverable<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks very much sort of</font>

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,080
like the long tail<font color="#CCCCCC"> of user information</font>

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything from how to winterize your</font>

32
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,200
shed to potty training your kids to

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,509
virtually any topic of any user interest

34
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,420
and we pay people<font color="#CCCCCC"> a combination of sort</font>

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,610
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways one an upfront</font>

36
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,710
payment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so some users</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an upfront</font>

37
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,659
payment for content they create and a

38
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">combination that also includes fees for</font>

39
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,150
traffic so for every thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> pageviews</font>

40
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,650
a piece of content generates we pay the

41
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,420
user a dollar fifty so there's a

42
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,950
performance component in an upfront

43
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,600
component and it works really well for

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,799
the users and it works really well for

45
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,170
advertisers so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recall this is a</font>

46
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,360
company was created by Tim Armstrong and

47
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,390
others out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Google basically coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

48
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,939
the whole search and discovery process

49
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,320
from the opposite side<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">traditional publications which are</font>

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,040
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do SEO to figure out how to</font>

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,329
get their stuff in the search engines

53
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,090
you design this with search in mind and

54
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,560
you're saying ninety percent is coming

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">from that do readers have any idea where</font>

56
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,149
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are do they know associated content</font>

57
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,008
they care does it matter at all or is

58
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,510
this in fact the way that you would

59
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,950
design a company if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

60
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,420
build it I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very good</font>

61
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,010
question i mean associated content in

62
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,290
many ways is brand agnostic<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean we</font>

63
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,120
would like more and more users to come

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,439
through a front<font color="#E5E5E5"> door again only ten</font>

65
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,819
percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that traffic comes through</font>

66
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,220
associated content<font color="#E5E5E5"> com but we are</font>

67
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,379
absolutely fine with the user landing on

68
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,579
a page that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they might have a little</font>

69
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">less familiarity with because I think</font>

70
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're playing into a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot of</font>

71
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,549
changes in sort of the user behavior

72
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:37,379
today everyone navigates the web through

73
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,269
search the nisha fication of user

74
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:41,549
interest people<font color="#E5E5E5"> relying more on blogs</font>

75
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">people relying more on different sources</font>

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,579
of information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might not look like</font>

77
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,989
your traditional source of information

78
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:48,690
so we play very nicely in that reality

79
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,790
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another thing that's quite</font>

80
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,920
interesting and Tim and Luke Beatty our

81
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,959
founder who were good friends when they

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,760
built the company they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized</font>

83
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,030
that content on the web was mostly old

84
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,889
terrestrial content that was brought to

85
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,269
the web that didn't take into things

86
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,900
like keyword tax on the keyword density

87
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,489
discoverability uniqueness all of those

88
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,139
things so they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to build a</font>

89
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,299
company where content was created for

90
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:14,010
the web specific to the web as opposed

91
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,599
to repurpose content from traditional

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,400
media brought to the web and if you look

93
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,190
at we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about Tim and AOL</font>

94
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,930
in another segment but if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

95
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the whole continuum of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> content companies</font>

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,430
you've got everybody from Wikipedia on

97
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,530
one sides totally user-generated then

98
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,510
there's mahalo which is basically human

99
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,879
search and so forth about.com where

100
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,989
humans are curating it in that continuum

101
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:38,340
everybody's writing your stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

102
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,959
forth then we have the new york times on

103
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,010
the other side where it's totally

104
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,129
top-down editorial and which<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

105
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:46,650
wings ultimately do you think well I

106
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,909
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good question I mean I</font>

107
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:49,699
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's definitely a place for</font>

108
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:52,470
professionally curated editorial driven

109
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,900
places for for for great premium content

110
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,790
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to say that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't sit in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

111
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,139
lens where it's a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

112
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">content experience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you mentioned</font>

113
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,530
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> com you mentioned wikipedia i</font>

114
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,699
think the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of notion of</font>

115
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,370
crowd-sourced content creation is a very

116
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting phenomenon because it's</font>

117
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,760
inexpensive to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's discoverable</font>

118
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,440
through search and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it plays into</font>

119
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,079
the realities again of user interests of

120
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:15,359
today in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of who's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to win i</font>

121
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,039
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good question i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

122
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,870
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a lot of companies today</font>

123
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,720
that are looking

124
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,060
for great platforms for content

125
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,770
discovery content monetization and

126
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,170
content creation you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I personally</font>

127
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,270
think that we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best one there's</font>

128
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,010
places like demand media there's places

129
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,990
like helium<font color="#CCCCCC"> suite101</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are lots of</font>

130
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,190
different companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are playing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">this space but we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been at this for</font>

132
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,970
years and what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

133
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,220
interesting our success we almost have

134
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,470
our own laboratory of success of the

135
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,340
more content we put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the grid the more</font>

136
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,390
discoverability of that content is lead

137
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,250
to a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience so right now we're a</font>

138
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,550
top 50 website and we're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy in</font>

139
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,690
that space would like to continue to

140
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,390
grow<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we'll talk about AOL and others</font>

141
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,130
in another segment of<font color="#CCCCCC"> at last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

our search algorithm today which

147

of anyone in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> content business needs</font>

151
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,250
to realize search is the oxygen of the

internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if Google wants to shut off</font>

careful and respectful of that but as a
