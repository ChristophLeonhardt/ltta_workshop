UNFORTUNATELY A VOLCANO ERUPTED
ON THE STATE OR ISLAND OF
HAWAII.
EVERYBODY IS CONCERNED, HAWAII
IS A WONDERFUL STATE.
BUT SOME FOLKS ñ THIS BRINGS US
TO THIS LEGENDARY PICTURE TAKEN
BY MARIO.
HE HEARD THE VOLCANO ERUPTED AND
HE THOUGHT THIS IS A GOOD
PLACE TO GET A VIEW OF IT.
HE FIGURES OUT PEOPLE WOULD BE
LOOKING AT IT BUT FINDS THAT
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GOLFING.
UNREAL.
HE TOOK ONE MORE PICTURE HERE ñ
GOTTA LOVE HOW CALM THE PEOPLE
OF HAWAII ARE.
THAT THERE WERE TWO FUN PARTS OF
THE STORY, ONE IS THE NAME OF
THE GOLF CLUB, IT IS CALLED THE
VOLCANO GOLF AND COUNTRY CLUB.
NO CLUB HAS EVER BEEN NAMED
MORE ACCURATELY.
THE PHOTOGRAPHER WENT ON THE
FAIRWAY TO TAKE THIS PICTURE AND
THE GOLFERS WERE LIKE GET OUT OF
THE FAIRWAY, AND THEY SHOOED HIM
OFF AND HE THEY SAID
THIS ABOUT HIM.
THESE GUYS ARE
GOING TO BE GOLFING LEGENDS.
THEY ARE LASER FOCUSED.
THE
PLANET IS ERUPTING, IT IS ON
FIRE AND THEY ARE OBLIVIOUS.
LET ME SHOW YOU A CHART OF
WHAT 
IS HAPPENING.
IT IS OFF THE CHARTS.
MEANWHILE WHAT DO WE HAVE?
WE
HAVE THIS GUY PLAYING THROUGH.
UNFORTUNATELY THAT PICTURE FUN
AND FUNNY IN SOME WAYS.
THOSE FOLKS ARE FINE, BUT IT IS
ALSO SYMBOLIC AND WE CANNOT
EVACUATE THE PLANET.
I KNOW ELON MUSK IS TRYING HARD
BUT WE ARE NOT THERE YET.
WE MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT
THE VOLCANO AND MAYBE DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
