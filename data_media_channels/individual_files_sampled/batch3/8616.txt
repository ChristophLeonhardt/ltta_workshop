Ed: AT THIS HOUR, BRETT KAVANAUGH POISED TO BECOME THE NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. IT WILL NO DOUBT ANGER HIS CRITICED THAT LASHED OUT AGAINST HIM ALL WEEK AND BEFORE THAT. INCLUDING CHELSEA CLINTON. WHAT WAS SO TROUBLING WITH HOW NAKEDLY PARTISAN HE WAS. SO ADMITTEDLY MY OPPOSITION TO HIM IS ROOTED IN POLICY, BUT I NOW AM EVEN MORE KIND OF INTENSE IN MY FEELINGS BECAUSE OF HOW POLITICAL HE'S BECOME. I'M WONDERING WHAT YOUR RESPONSE IS TO HOW WE'VE SEEN DR. FORD'S PLAY? WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THOSE THAT SAID I WAS GOING TO DO THAT BUT I DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH THAT? I WOULD SAY I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I HOPE YOU'RE STILL WILLING TO RAISE YOUR HAND, RAISE YOUR VOICE. Ed: HERE NOW, JUANITA BRODRICK THAT ACCUSED FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON OF RAPING HER IN 1978 WHILE HE WAS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR. NIGHT TO HAVE YOU HERE. GOOD TO BE HERE. WHAT ALLEGEDLY HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND BILL CLINTON DID TO YOU THAT YOU ALLEGE? CHELSEA CLINTON IS NOT CULPABLE FOR THAT BUT HOW DO YOU REACT WITH WHAT SHE SAID? I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS. I DO. I FEEL LIKE SHE NEEDS TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HER OWN FAMILY AND DEAL WITH HER OWN FAMILY AND WHAT THEY DID TO ME BEFORE SHE CAN EVEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE A COMMENT AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH OR IN FAVOR OF DR. FORD. SPEAKING OF HER FAMILY, LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HILLARY CLINTON, OF COURSE, THE FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SAID IN 2015. LISTEN TO THIS. WELL, I WOULD SAY THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE BELIEVED AT FIRST UNTIL THEY ARE DISBELIEVED BASED ON EVIDENCE. Ed: EVERYONE SHOULD BE BELIEVED AND MOVE IT FORWARD TO THE DEBATE THIS PAST WEEK OR SO. WE HEARD DEMOCRAT AFTER DEMOCRAT SAY WHEN IT CAME TO DR. FORD, WE BELIEVE HER. BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT REACTION. I DID. I DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE ON MY SIDE EXCEPT THE PUBLIC. THE PUBLIC WAS ON MY SIDE. BUT THE MEDIA JUST HOUNDED ME AND HAD THE MOST AWFUL, YOU KNOW, THINGS TO SAY ABOUT ME. IT WAS VERY DISHEARTENING. Ed: WHAT WE HEARD IN THE LAST WEEK THAT MIGHT HAVE TILTED THE LAST DAY, SUSAN COLLINS AND JOE MANCHIN TO SUPPORT JUDGE KAVANAUGH. THE IDEA THAT THERE WAS NO CORROBORATION TO THE ALLEGATIONS THAT DR. FORD RAISED. WHAT WAS THE CORROBORATION THAT YOU BROUGHT TO THE TABLE TO BE FAIR HERE? I HAD THE LATE DID THAT FOUND ME 30 MINUTES AFTER THE RAPE AND I TOLD FIVE OTHER PEOPLE. I HAD THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE SEMINAR THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ATTENDING THAT DAY. IT WAS THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS. I CAN REMEMBER EVERYTHING ABOUT THE EVENT. I CAN'T IMAGINE DR. FORD, IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED TO HER, NOT TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER THE LITTLEST DETAILS. I DO. Ed: DID YOU COME FORWARD TO THE ARKANSAS POLICE? NO. HOW COULD I COME FORWARD TO THE POLICE? BILL CLINTON WAS THE POLICE. HE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Ed: ATTORNEY GENERAL, LATER GOVERNOR, OF COURSE. RIGHT. HE REGULATED MY NURSING HOMES. I OWNED NURSING HOLMES AT THE TIME. HE WAS THE ONE THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING NURSING HOMES. Ed: WE HEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP TAKE SOME HEAT THIS WEEK FOR RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT DR. FORD'S STORY. AMONG OTHER THINGS HE SAID, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T SHE, WHY DIDN'T HER LOVING PARENTS COME FORWARD WITH THIS STORY DECADES AGO. HOW DO YOU ANSWER THAT? I WAS FRIGHTENED. I WAS INTIMIDATED BY HILLARY CLINTON THREE WEEKS AFTER THE RAPE. AND I WAS VERY FRIGHTENED. I WAS FRIGHTENED OF THEM. THEY GAIN POWER BY THE YEAR. I STILL WAS A STRUGGLING BUSINESS OWNER THAT BILL CLINTON COULD HAVE SHUT DOWN AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE. Ed: YOU TALKED ABOUT DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO HAS BEEN FRONT AND CENTER IN THE BATTLE, RECEIVING THE ANONYMOUS LETTER FROM DR. FORD, SITTING ON IT AND A ALL THE REST. WHEN YOU CAME FORWARD, SHE DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR STORY. NOT AT ALL. I DIDN'T COME FORWARD WILLINGLY. I WAS OUTED BY THE PAULA JONES SUIT. THEN HERE'S KEN STARR'S PEOPLE. THAT'S WHEN I TOLD THE TRUTH. I WENT THROUGH A DIFFICULT DEPOSITION, YOU KNOW, WITH THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL. AND THEY REFUSED TO READ IT. NOT ONE DEMOCRAT WOULD READ IT. Ed: SO FINAL QUESTION. WHAT DO YOU WANT ALL OF THESE YEARS LATER? WHAT WOULD BE JUSTICE FOR YOU? JUSTICE WOULD BE FOR ME TO HAVE AN INVESTIGATION. IF THEY'RE GOING TO GO BACK 35 YEARS, 36 YEARS FOR CHRISTINE FORD, THEY OUGHT TO GO BACK 39 FOR ME. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE, IF THEY CAN IF IT CAN BE PROVED THAT THIS HAPPENED, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE PRESIDENT CLINTON PERKS AS A FORMER PRESIDENT REMOVED. HE RECEIVES MILLIONS FROM OUR
