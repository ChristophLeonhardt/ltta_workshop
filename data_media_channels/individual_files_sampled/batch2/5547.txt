now a member of the Foreign Relations Committee Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut senator it's good to have you with us got a lot to talk to you about including North Korea but just want to get your initial reaction from the president's tweet of a few minutes ago he wrote look how things have turned around on the criminal deep state they go after phony collusion with Russia a made-up scam and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before what goes around comes around he's calling this spy gate it's a hunch he has based on no fact whatsoever that a spy was planted by the FBI and the Department of Justice in his campaign in 2016 what's your reaction to this well as usual the president is just simply making things up in order to create a cloud around very bad news for him I'm sure he's very nervous this morning is he's realizing that his closest confidant his fixer Michael Cohen is getting closer and closer to real deep trouble that might end up in Cohen cooperating against the president this news of another client of Cohen's cooperating is probably very troubling very vexing for the president and the sea wakes up this morning trying to create even more smoke even more obfuscation around this investigation that continues into him I guess you know what I continue to worry about is that you know belief in the rule of law is one of the pillars of modern democracy and as people start to believe the president that law enforcement is simply just another political arm of the government it undermines everyone's faith in this experiment of democracy and so I really worry that we are seeing altum Utley an assault on democracy itself that may in the long run succeed so Dan Goldman you of course worked in the US Attorney's Office Southern District here in New York what's your reaction first the tweet and second to the distinction between a spy terminal and the president is using and an informant fee for the FBI interviewing people on the campaign because they saw some connection between Russia and the campaign let me start with that the biggest and easiest way to distinguish it is that a what he calls a spy and what others are calling a spy is what is commonly referred to as an undercover agent which is an employee of the FBI so they are full-time employees of the FBI and they are work undercover they're not assets they're there they're not employees that's right right what a confidential informant is is what you might call an asset or a source of information who's someone who through the ordinary course of his or her life comes into contact with anything of interest in this case its counterintelligence so it may be something related to Russia or otherwise and then they report back to their handlers that's how the whole counterintelligence division of the FBI operates is based on sources of information so from what we know this professor was an informant who provided information he did not work full-time for the FBI in any way shape or form and so technically speaking it is an informant it is not an undercover agent and it is not a spy this so what what the president is doing with this tweet of course is trying to flip it on its head trying to make this seem to be a big scandal and as a former member of what the quote-unquote deep state I find it incredibly troubling and infuriating that he continues to use this language to bash the career professionals that work for the Department of Justice I worked there for ten years I did not for one moment ever consider political aspects of anything I was doing the partisan nature of anything I was doing the people who work at the FBI who work as prosecutors in the Department of Justice follow evidence that is all they do and for this for this president the head of the executive branch to continue to bash the career professionals who are day in and day out trying to enforce our laws and save our national security is incredibly debilitating it's incredibly destructive and just as the senator says it really runs the risk of permanently damaging the institutions that our country is founded on and somebody hopefully not just the Democratic senators in in the Senate like senator Murphy but the Republicans need to stand up and say this is unacceptable the bull anymore there is no deep state and we need to stop talking about it senator let's get back to the relatively a straightforward simple question of North Korea I think it's pretty clear that the North Koreans are not going to do with the National Security Adviser and the president want which is to immediately get rid of all their nuclear capabilities materials what have you would you favor a summit where the United States would have some kind of a lessor agreement some version if you will of an Iran like agreement with with North Korea that would place certain limits on testing or capabilities and do you think such an agreement should be introduced to the Congress for approval and if so would it be approved well I think we have to be both realistic and flexible in these potential negotiations with North Korea the alternative to being realistic and flexible is a North Korea that continues to build up a nuclear weapons program that can even more seriously threaten the United States and our neighbors so yes I think I hope that the president and the secretary are going to be thinking of ways to put North Korea on a path it's a total complete denuclearization and I think I'll leave it to you no to the agreement and the details inside as to whether it has to come to Congress for approval obviously I didn't think the Iran agreement had to come to Congress I thought that that was an executive agreement and I think you have to you know look at the parameters first I think it is important to remember that we mean something different when we say denuclearization than the South the North Koreans do what they mean is that the United States moves all of its weapons and troops out of the peninsula as well something that the South Koreans would not agree to as part of that negotiation so I think we just have to underscore how difficult completely nuclearization is given that we think it means different things and be a little bit more flexible as we head into the negotiations just to follow up on one thing you said do you think that we ought to be willing to put the 28,500 American troops into the mix here what do you think that ought to not not enter the negotiations at this point no I don't think it should enter the negotiations in fact I think it would be a potential cataclysmic mistake for a number of reasons for the United States to withdraw our troops from Korea first obviously we are going to have to verify and be very skeptical about any commitments in the North Koreans make because they have violated those agreements in the past in the past but second you know what North Korea also wants is for the United States to exit the region but the Chinese also want that too and for us to just disappear from the Korean Peninsula would be a gift not just to the North Koreans but to the Chinese as well senator howdy Priscilla has a question for you senator the President himself said yesterday that there is a substantial chance now that this summit won't work out he has a national security adviser now who has basically written in the past about pre-emptive strikes on both Iran and North Korea we're talking now about a plan B how does the fact that John Bolton is the adviser now to the president and his past positions on this issue going to color what you think our options are and even offering a middle ground well you know I this has always been my worry from the beginning that the worst-case outcome here is for this administration to make a attempt at diplomacy and then when that diplomacy fails either because the meeting doesn't go well or because the meeting never happens it allows for John Bolton and perhaps Mike Pompeo to walk into the Oval Office and tell the president well listen you try diplomacy it didn't work there's really no option left except for a strike against the North Koreans and as you mentioned John Bolton will also tell the president that he doesn't have to come to Congress for that authorization which is completely wrong it's why I ventured why I've introduced legislation in the Senate to make clear that the president is thinking about pre-emptive military action against North Korea that he has to come and get congressional consent first but clearly John Bolton doesn't believe that and if this summit falls apart it's not outside the realm of possibility that Bolden used as it uses that as an opportunity to make his case Senator Chris Murphy Democrat of Connecticut always good to talk to you thanks so much thanks guys Daniel Goldman thank you as well we'll see you soon coming up and the president's legal team
