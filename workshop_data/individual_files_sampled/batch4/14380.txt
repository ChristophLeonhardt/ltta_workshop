let me play the money quote again it's just 35 seconds we will be unveiling a very detailed and comprehensive plan because we believe that Canada has to be part of the solution we're about a year away from the next election a little bit more I guarantee you we will have a comprehensive message to Canadians that doesn't just focus in on that will reach that will reach just I'm just asking because you know your this is the big issue because it ties in with pipelines as you said the the former Harper regulations would not come close to meeting this car the targets that the harper government set and you want to keep those will you unveil a plan that will actually meet the paris targets of course i will a plan that reaches the targets that that we have already voted in favor we believe that canada has to be part of the solution we want to have we will we will have a meaningful plan to reduce emissions i wanted to play that for you twice i wanted you to really hear it see that's the thing it wasn't a gaffe or a case of miss speaking or misunderstanding it's very true andrew shear has previously endorsed the UN's global warming scheme this isn't a gaffe he didn't do any of this before the leadership vote of course he didn't breathe a word of his support for this global warming agenda do you think the conservative party members across canada would have voted for him if he had said in advance that he submitted to the UN's global warming system and would abide by its orders yeah and no like I say Shearer got just 22% of the vote of conservative leadership voters on the first ballot it had to go to 13 ballots and the nd one with 51% Shearer was relatively unknown he was the former Speaker of the House of Commons who really hadn't expressed himself on a lot of issues to people I think people just projected on to him their hopes like hoping he wasn't for the UN's global warming schemes I mean you you pretty much take that for granted and in conservatives excuse me but no one of here's first acts as leader was to literally force every Conservative MP to vote along with a liberal motion to support the UN on global warming let me say that again not only did she report he forced every P in his caucus including those in the oil patch to vote for it that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
