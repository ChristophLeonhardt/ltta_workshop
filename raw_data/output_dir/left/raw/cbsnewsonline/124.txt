1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,302
THAT IS WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE 

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,304
CONCERN FOR THE PRESIDENT THAT 

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,573
THIS WILL BE SEEN AS 

4
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:11,411
DELEGITIMIZING HIS VICTORY, 

5
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:12,045
WHICH IT DOESN'T. 

6
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,246
>>DO YOU THINK THAT SENSITIVITY 

7
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:14,681
IS PREVENTING HIM FROM BEING 

8
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,583
ENTIRELY CLEAR WHEN IT COMES TO 

9
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,350
THE RUSSIAN THREAT? 

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,985
>> THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE AROUND 

11
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,085
HIM PRIVATELY SUGGEST. 

12
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:23,423
>>OF COURSE THE THREAT AS WE 

13
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,692
HEAR FROM TECH REPORTERS AND 

14
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,893
PEOPLE WHO KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT 

15
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:28,728
THE SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD THAN YOU 

16
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,564
OR ME SAY THAT THREAT IS VERY 

17
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:32,665
MUCH A THERE. 

18
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:36,636
>> YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TECH 

19
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:36,903
EXPERTS. 

20
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,071
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY SAYS 

21
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,673
IT, LAWMAKERS ARE LED TO 

22
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,875
BELIEVE THAT IT COULD BE A 

23
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,709
PROBLEM AGAIN, STATE OFFICIALS 

24
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:47,380
WHO ARE RECEIVING -- ARE 

25
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:47,780
RAISING CONCERNS. 

26
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,015
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT 

27
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,049
INFLUENCES THE RESULT BUT THEY 

28
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,818
ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING TO 

29
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,053
UP AND VOTING OR POTENTIALLY 

30
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:57,557
THE RESULTS AND WE HAVE NOT 

31
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,291
SEEN IT. 

32
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,792
>> WHAT IS CONCERNING IS THERE 

33
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:00,993
HAVE BEEN INTELLIGENCE 

34
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:02,662
ASSESSMENTS THAT THE RUSSIA 

35
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,063
INTERFERENCE IS ONGOING AND 

36
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:06,766
THAT IT CONTINUES AS WE SPEAK. 

37
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:11,037
>> IT LOOKS LIKE IN HIS COMMENTS

38
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,172
WITH REPORTERS, WE ARE AWAITING 

39
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:19,179
ON THE TAPE, IS THAT HE SUGGESTS

40
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,280
THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL DO 

41
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,048
WHATEVER IT CAN TO STOP THIS 

42
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,349
FROM HAPPENING. 

43
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,784
I HAVE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT THE 

44
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,152
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE DOING 

45
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,021
THAT ALREADY. FOR HIM TO DOUBLE 

46
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,255
DOWN AND SUGGEST THAT HE IS 

47
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,490
GOING TO DO MORE CERTAINLY WILL 

48
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,326
BE REASSURING TO SOME WHO ARE 

49
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,360
CONCERNED THAT HE IS PERHAPS 

50
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,428
NOT DOING ENOUGH. 

51
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,597
>>I WANT TO GO BACK TO 

52
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,398
SOMETHING THAT SENATOR SCHUMER 

53
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,234
WAS SAYING EARLIER, THIS CALL 

54
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,268
FROM THE DEMOCRATS FOR THE 

55
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,703
PRESIDENT TO RELEASE HIS TAX 

56
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,271
RETURNS. 

57
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,472
WHY HAS THAT BEEN DIFFICULT FOR 

58
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:47,307
THE PRESIDENT TO DO? 

59
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:51,144
EVERY PAST PRESIDENT HAS DONE 

60
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,178
THAT WHEN THEY WERE RUNNING, 

61
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,147
WHY NOT DO THAT NOW AND CLEAR 

62
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:54,814
THIS UP? 

63
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:59,519
>> YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIM. 

64
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,720
HE HAS STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO DO 

65
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:00,954
IT. 

66
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,355
HE DID NOT FEEL THE NEED DURING 

67
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,390
THE ELECTION, HE WON SO WHAT IS 

68
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,427
THE HARM OF HOLDING IT BACK? 

69
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,661
THERE IS NO LAW THAT REQUIRES 

70
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,097
IT, IT WAS JUST TRADITION. 

71
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,532
UNLESS IT IS LAW HE WILL HOLD 

72
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,468
ONTO THEM FOR AS LONG AS HE CAN.

73
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,969
ONE OTHER WAY IT COULD COME OUT 

74
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:17,970
IS THE ONGOING LEGAL CHALLENGES 

75
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,405
THAT HE FACES BOTH A DEFAMATION 

76
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,406
LAWSUIT FROM WOMEN WHO HAVE 

77
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:24,477
ALLEGED RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIM 

78
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,478
AND FROM THE OTHER ONGOING 

79
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:25,845
INVESTIGATIONS. 

80
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:26,913
THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT 

81
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,782
ALL OR MORE ARE RELEASE. 

82
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,619
FOR HIM TO DO IT ON HIS OWN, 

83
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,886
THAT WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT ANY 

84
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:34,721
TIME SOON. 

85
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,889
>>WHAT ABOUT THE 12 INDICTMENTS 

86
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:40,760
OF THE RUSSIANS? 

87
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,495
IT PUTS TO REST ANY IDEA OF 

88
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,664
WHAT IS GOING ON IS A WITCHHUNT.

89
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:49,702
>> AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 

90
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:50,870
SUPPORTERS WILL SEE IT AS SUCH. 

91
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,538
WHAT I THINK THIS CONTINUES TO 

92
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:54,741
DO IS THAT THERE WERE ATTEMPTS 

93
00:02:54,741 --> 00:03:01,047
MADE BY RUSSIANS TO INTERFERE 

94
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,048
WITH AND POTENTIALLY METAL WITH 

95
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,316
THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION AND 

96
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:03,716
THEY FAIL. 

97
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,952
IT WAS MADE VERY CLEAR -- 

98
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,289
>> SORRY TO INTERRUPT WE HAVE 

99
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,356
THE TAPE. 

100
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:15,895
>> -- WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD 

101
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,531
WITH OUR ALLIES. WE ARE GOING 

102
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,567
TO HAVE PEACE, THAT'S WHAT WE 

103
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,802
WANT AND THAT'S WHAT WE WILL 

104
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:23,002
HAVE. 

105
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,604
PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. 

106
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,675
I HAVE HELPED THE NATO ALLIES 

107
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,742
BY INCREASING DEFENSE 

108
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,577
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR NATIVE 

109
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:37,016
ALLIES -- NATO ALLIES AND 

110
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,584
SECRETARY -- WAS FANTASTIC AS 

111
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:41,688
YOU KNOW HE REPORTED THAT THEY 

112
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,922
HAVE NEVER HAD AN INCREASE LIKE 

113
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,358
THIS IN THEIR HISTORY AND NATO 

114
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,126
WAS GOING DOWN AS OPPOSED TO 

115
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,595
GOING UP. 

116
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:50,830
I INCREASED IT BY THE MEETING 

117
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,198
LAST YEAR $44 MILLION. 

118
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,701
THIS YEAR IT WILL BE HUNDREDS 

119
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,336
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE 

120
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:56,736
COMING YEARS. 

121
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,471
I THINK THAT THERE IS GREAT 

122
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:01,174
UNITY WITH NATO. 

123
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,942
THERE IS A LOT OF POSITIVE 

124
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,110
THINGS HAPPENING. 

125
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,411
THERE IS A GREAT SPIRIT THAT WE 

126
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:09,482
DID NOT HAVE BEFORE AND A LOT 

127
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,717
OF MONEY THAT THEY WERE NOT 

128
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,150
PUTTING UP. 

129
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,151
THEY WERE NOT PAYING THEIR 

130
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,586
BILLS ON TIME AND NOW THEY ARE 

131
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:13,986
DOING THAT. 

132
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:15,421
I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY 

133
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,822
MUCH TO SECRETARY STOLTENBERG, 

134
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:20,493
HE HAS BEEN TERRIFIC. 

135
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,528
WE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. 

136
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,297
I ALSO HAD MEETINGS WITH PRIME 

137
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,398
MINISTER MAY ON THE RANGE OF 

138
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:28,901
ISSUES CONCERNING OUR SPECIAL 

139
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,637
RELATIONSHIP. THAT IS BETWEEN 

140
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,672
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND 

141
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:34,474
OURSELVES. 

142
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,944
WE MET WITH THE QUEEN WHO IS 

143
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,282
ABSOLUTELY A TERRIFIC PERSON 

144
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,015
WHERE SHE REVIEWED HER HONOR 

145
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:44,450
GUARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 70 

146
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,485
YEARS, THEY TELL ME. 

147
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,821
WE WALKED IN FRONT OF THE -- AND

148
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,357
THAT WAS VERY INSPIRING TO SEE 

149
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:56,929
AND TO BE WITH HER. I THINK THE 

150
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,064
RELATIONSHIP I CAN TRULY SAY IS 

151
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:58,898
A GOOD ONE. 

152
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:04,537
SHE WAS VERY INSPIRING. 

153
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,105
MOST RECENTLY I RETURNED FROM 

154
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:10,410
HELSINKI FINLAND AND I WAS 

155
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,744
GOING TO GIVE A NEWS CONFERENCE 

156
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:12,845
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS 

157
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,479
ABOUT THE SUCCESS. 

158
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,314
AS SUCCESSFUL AS NATIVE WAS -- 

159
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,949
NATO WAS THIS WAS OUR MOST 

160
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:17,382
SUCCESSFUL VISIT. 

161
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:20,153
THAT HAD TO DO WITH RUSSIA. I 

162
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:26,526
MET WITH RUSSIA PRESIDENT 

163
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,727
VLADIMIR PUTIN IN AN ATTEMPT TO 

164
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,861
TACKLE SOME OF THE MOST 

165
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,898
PRESSING ISSUES FACING HUMANITY.

166
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,399
WE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A WORSE 

167
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,637
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA THEN 

168
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,272
WE WERE AS OF A FEW DAYS AGO 

169
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,473
AND I THINK THAT HAS GOTTEN 

170
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,507
SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER AND IT HAS 

171
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,975
THE POSSIBILITY TO GET MUCH 

172
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,944
BETTER. 

173
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,379
I USED TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN 

174
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,413
THE CAMPAIGN THAT GETTING ALONG 

175
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,614
WITH RUSSIA WOULD BE A GOOD 

176
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,882
THING AND GETTING ALONG WITH 

177
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,519
CHINA WOULD BE A GOOD THING, 

178
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,954
NOT A BAD THING BUT A GOOD 

179
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:55,187
THING. 

180
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,989
WE ARE GREAT NUCLEAR POWERS. 

181
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,191
RUSSIA AND US HAVE 90 PERCENT 

182
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,827
OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

183
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,861
GETTING ALONG IS A POSITIVE 

184
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,496
THING AND NOT JUST FOR THAT 

185
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:03,729
REASON. 

186
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,465
I ENTERED THE MEETING WITH THE 

187
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,968
FIRM CONVICTION THAT DIPLOMACY 

188
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:09,969
AND ENGAGEMENT IS BETTER THAN 

189
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:10,602
HOSTILITY AND CONFLICT. 

190
00:06:10,602 --> 00:06:12,605
I FEEL THAT WITH EVERYBODY. 

191
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:16,242
WE HAVE 29 MEMBERS IN NATO THAT 

192
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,810
I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS OR 

193
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,245
AT LEAST GOOD RELATIONSHIPS 

194
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,949
WITH EVERYBODY. 

195
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,983
THE PRESS COVERED IT IN 

196
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,517
ACCURATELY THEY SAID I INSULTED 

197
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:28,888
PEOPLE. I WAS ASKING FOR PEOPLE 

198
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,289
TO PAY UP MONEY THAT THEY WERE 

199
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,292
SUPPOSED TO PAY, THEY SAY 

200
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,161
THAT'S INSULTING. 

201
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,595
WHEN I LEFT EVERYBODY WAS 

202
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:37,396
THRILLED. 

203
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:42,468
MY MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN 

204
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,469
WAS REALLY INTERESTING IN SO 

205
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,105
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. 

206
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,206
WE HAVE NOT HAD RELATIONSHIPS 

207
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,875
WITH RUSSIA FOR A LONG TIME. 

208
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,942
WE STARTED. 

209
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,145
LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT 

210
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:57,049
ONCE AGAIN, THE TOTAL FAITH AND 

211
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,285
SUPPORT FOR AMERICA'S 

212
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:03,222
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, I HAVE 

213
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,790
FULL FAITH AND OUR INTELLIGENCE 

214
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,059
AGENCIES. 

215
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,060
THEY JUST TURNED OFF THE 

216
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,293
LIGHTS. 

217
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:09,295
THAT MUST BE DUE DILIGENCE. 

218
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:13,165
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY? THAT WAS 

219
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:13,966
STRANGE. 

220
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,768
THAT IS OKAY. 

221
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:20,840
I WILL BEGIN BY STATING THAT I 

222
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,876
HAVE FULL FAITH AND SUPPORT FOR 

223
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,043
AMERICA'S GREAT INTELLIGENCE 

224
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:29,148
AGENCIES, ALWAYS HAVE. 

225
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,416
I HAVE FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT 

226
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,617
WHILE RUSSIA'S ACTIONS HAD NO 

227
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,021
IMPACT AT ALL ON THE OUTCOME OF 

228
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,722
THE ELECTION, LET ME BE TOTALLY 

229
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,759
CLEAR IN SAYING, I HAVE SAID 

230
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,628
THIS MANY TIMES, I ACCEPT OUR 

231
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,528
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 

232
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,964
CONCLUSION THAT RUSSIA'S 

233
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:50,670
MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION 

234
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:56,843
TOOK PLACE. THERE ARE A LOT OF 

235
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,078
PEOPLE OUT THERE, THERE WAS NO 

236
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,613
COLLUSION AT ALL. PEOPLE HAVE 

237
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:04,350
SEEN THAT AND THEY HAVE SEEN I 

238
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:04,617
STRONGLY. 

239
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,185
THE HOUSE HAS COME OUT STRONGLY

240
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,220
, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE COME OUT 

241
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,621
STRONGLY. 

242
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,257
I FELT I MADE MYSELF VERY CLEAR 

243
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,691
BY HAVING JUST REVIEWED THE 

244
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:14,527
TRANSCRIPT, I HAVE TO SAY THAT 

245
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,529
I CAME BACK AND I SAID WHAT IS 

246
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,565
THE BIG DEAL. 

247
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,334
I HAVE A TRANSCRIPT AND I 

248
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,803
REVIEWED IT AND I WENT OUT AND 

249
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,838
I REVIEWED A CLIP OF AN ANSWER 

250
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,508
THAT I GAVE AND I REALIZED THAT 

251
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,177
THERE IS A NEED FOR SOME 

252
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,544
CLARIFICATION. 

253
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,145
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS, I 

254
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:37,650
THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 

255
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,884
OBVIOUS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO 

256
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:40,086
CLARIFY JUST IN CASE IT WAS 

257
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:40,318
NOT. 

258
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:41,821
IN A KEY SENTENCE IN MY REMARKS 

259
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,690
I SAID THE WORD WOULD INSTEAD 

260
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,992
OF WOULDN'T. 

261
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,827
INSTEAD OF SHOULD HAVE BEEN I 

262
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,729
DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY I 

263
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,099
WOULDN'T BE RUSSIA. 

264
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,101
JUST TO REPEAT IT I SAID THE 

265
00:08:55,101 --> 00:09:01,407
WORD WOULD INSTEAD OF WOULDN'T 

266
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,408
AND THE SENTENCE SHOULD HAVE 

267
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,843
BEEN I THOUGHT I WOULD BE MAYBE 

268
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,444
A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR ON THE 

269
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,013
TRANSCRIPT OR UNCLEAR ON THE 

270
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,514
ACTUAL VIDEO, THE SENTENCE 

271
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,315
SHOULD HAVE BEEN I DON'T SEE 

272
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:13,618
ANY REASON WHY IT WOULDN'T BE 

273
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:16,321
RUSSIA, SORT OF A DOUBLE 

274
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:19,492
NEGATIVE. 

275
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,526
YOU CAN PUT THAT IN. 

276
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,527
I THINK THAT PROBABLY CLARIFIS 

277
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,361
THINGS PRETTY GOOD. 

278
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,996
I HAVE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS 

279
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,165
NOTED ON INTELLIGENCE FINDINGS 

280
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,502
THAT RUSSIA'S ATTEMPT TO 

281
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,069
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS 

282
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,737
UNLIKE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS,

283
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:36,542
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS AND WILL 

284
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,376
CONTINUE TO MOVE AGGRESSIVELY 

285
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,379
AND REPEAL ANY EFFORTS AND 

286
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,814
REPEL, WE WILL STOP IT AND WE 

287
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,683
WILL REPEL IT ANY EFFORTS TO 

288
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:50,589
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS. WE 

289
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:51,590
ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR 

290
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,425
POWER TO PREVENT RUSSIA 

291
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,025
INTERFERENCE IN 2018. 

292
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,860
WE HAVE A LOT OF POWER AND AS 

293
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,097
YOU KNOW PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS 

294
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,665
GIVEN INFORMATION JUST PRIOR TO 

295
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,267
THE ELECTION, THE LAST ELECTION 

296
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:08,007
2016 AND THEY DECIDED NOT TO DO 

297
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:08,641
ANYTHING ABOUT IT. 

298
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,477
THE REASON THEY DECIDED THAT 

299
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,678
WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS TO ALL, THEY 

300
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,512
THOUGHT HILLARY CLINTON WAS 

301
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,814
GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION AND 

302
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,816
THEY DID NOT THINK IT WAS A BIG 

303
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,183
DEAL. 

304
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,417
WHEN I WON THE ELECTION THEY 

305
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,253
THOUGHT IT WAS A BIG DEAL AND 

306
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,688
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY WENT INTO 

307
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,524
ACTION BUT IT WAS LATE. 

308
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,726
HE WAS GIVEN THAT IN SHARP 

309
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,427
CONTRAST TO THE WAY IT SHOULD 

310
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,995
BE. 

311
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:31,797
PRESIDENT OBAMA ALONG WITH 

312
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,399
BRENNAN AND CLAPPER AND THE 

313
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,868
WHOLE GROUP THAT YOU SEE ON 

314
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,470
TELEVISION GETTING PAID A LOT 

315
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,340
OF MONEY FROM THE NETWORKS, 

316
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,141
THEY KNEW ABOUT RUSSIA'S 

317
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,175
ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE IN THE 

318
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,176
ELECTION IN SEPTEMBER AND THEY 

319
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,544
TOTALLY BURIED AT. 

320
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:49,648
AS I SAID THEY BURIED IT 

321
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:50,516
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HILLARY 

322
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,552
CLINTON WAS GOING TO WIN. 

323
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,987
IT TURNED OUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN 

324
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,387
THAT WAY. 

325
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:56,455
BY CONTRAST MY ADMINISTRATION 

326
00:10:56,455 --> 00:11:00,059
HAS TAKEN A VERY FIRM STANCE ON 

327
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,495
A STRONG ACTION. WE ARE GOING 

328
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,731
TO TAKE STRONG ACTION TO SECURE 

329
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,200
OUR ELECTION SYSTEM AND THE 

330
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,335
PROCESS. 

331
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:15,274
FURTHERMORE, AS HAS BEEN STATED 

332
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,275
AND WE HAVE STATED IT 

333
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,644
PREVIOUSLY ON MANY OCCASIONS, 

334
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,782
NO COLLUSION. 

335
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,683
YESTERDAY WE MADE SIGNIFICANT 

336
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,450
PROGRESS TOWARD ADDRESSING SOME 

337
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,651
OF THE WORST CONFLICTS. 

338
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,087
WHEN I MET WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN 

339
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,523
FOR ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS, WE 

340
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,893
TALKED ABOUT NUMEROUS THINGS 

341
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,530
AND AMONG THOSE THINGS ARE THE 

342
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,198
PROBLEMS THAT YOU SEE IN THE 

343
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,933
MIDDLE EAST, WE ARE VERY MUCH 

344
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,168
INVOLVED, THEY ARE VERY MUCH 

345
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,538
INVOLVED, I ENTERED THE 

346
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,638
NEGOTIATIONS WITH PRESIDENT 

347
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:49,108
PUTIN FROM A POSITION OF 

348
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,210
TREMENDOUS STRENGTH. 

349
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,411
OUR ECONOMY IS BOOMING AND THE 

350
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,280
MILITARY IS BEING FUNDED $716 

351
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:01,187
BILLION. IT WILL BE MORE 

352
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,221
POWERFUL AS A MILITARY THAN 

353
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,222
WHAT WE HAVE HAD BEFORE. 

354
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,223
PRESIDENT PUTIN AND I ADDRESS 

355
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,092
THE RANGE OF ISSUES STARTING 

356
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:10,763
WITH THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA AND 

357
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,163
THE NEED FOR HUMANITARIAN AID 

358
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:15,401
AND HELP FOR PEOPLE IN SYRIA. 

359
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,871
WE ALSO SPOKE OF IRAN AND THE 

360
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,774
NEED TO HOLD NUCLEAR AMBITIONS 

361
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:22,675
AND DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES 

362
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,545
TAKING PLACE IN IRAN. AS MOST 

363
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:32,484
OF YOU KNOW WE ENDED THE IRAN 

364
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:33,886
DEAL WHICH WAS ONE OF THE WORST 

365
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:34,720
DEALS THAT ANYONE COULD 

366
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:34,987
IMAGINE. 

367
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,522
THAT HAS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON 

368
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,123
IRAN AND IT HAS SUBSTANTIALLY 

369
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,992
WEAKENED IRAN AND WE HOPE AT 

370
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,527
SOME POINT THEY CALL US AND WE 

371
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,663
MAKE A NEW DEAL. 

372
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:45,898
IRAN IS NOT THE SAME COUNTRY 

373
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,334
THAT IT WAS FIVE MONTHS AGO. 

374
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:53,572
THAT I CAN TELL YOU. 

375
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:58,244
THEY HAVE SOME BIG PROBLEMS 

376
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,079
THAT THEY CAN SOLVE MUCH EASIER 

377
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,515
IF THEY DEAL WITH US. 

378
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,016
WE DID DISCUSS IRAN, WE 

379
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:06,819
DISCUSSED ISRAEL AND THE 

380
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,455
SECURITY OF ISRAEL AND 

381
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,291
PRESIDENT PUTIN IS VERY MUCH 

382
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,093
INVOLVED NOW WITH US IN THE 

383
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,061
DISCUSSION WITH BENJAMIN 

384
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,197
NETANYAHU IN WORKING SOMETHING 

385
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:22,668
OUT WITH SURROUNDING SYRIA. 

386
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,036
SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDS TO 

387
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,771
THE SECURITY AND LONG-TERM 

388
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,907
SECURITY OF ISRAEL. 

389
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,141
THE MAJOR TOPIC OF DISCUSSION 

390
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,778
WAS NORTH KOREA AND THE NEED 

391
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,279
FOR IT TO REMOVE NUCLEAR 

392
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,883
WEAPONS. 

393
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,118
RUSSIA HAS ASSURED US OF ITS 

394
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:39,385
SUPPORT. 

395
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,886
PRESIDENT PUTIN SAYS HE AGREES 

396
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,755
WITH ME 100 PERCENT THAT THEY 

397
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,390
WILL DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO 

398
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,824
TRY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. 

399
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:46,625
DISCUSSIONS ARE ONGOING AND 

400
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,660
THEY ARE GOING VERY WELL. 

401
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,496
WE HAVE NO RUSH FOR SPEED. 

402
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,897
THE SANCTIONS ARE REMAINING, 

403
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,133
THE HOSTAGES ARE BACK, THERE 

404
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,970
HAVE BEEN NO TESTS, NO ROCKETS 

405
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,371
GOING UP FOR A PERIOD OF NINE 

406
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,139
MONTHS. 

407
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,242
I THINK THE RELATIONSHIP IS 

408
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:03,676
VERY GOOD. 

409
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,911
WE WILL SEE HOW THAT GOES. 

410
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,780
WE HAVE NO TIME LIMIT, NO SPEED 

411
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,148
LIMIT. 

412
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,815
WE ARE JUST GOING THROUGH THE 

413
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:14,053
PROCESS. 

414
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,254
PRESIDENT PUTIN IS GOING TO BE 

415
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:19,124
INVOLVED IN THE SENSE THAT HE 

416
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,759
IS WITH US AND HE WOULD LIKE TO 

417
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,594
SEE THAT HAPPEN. 

418
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:23,395
PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT 

419
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,030
ISSUE THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE 

420
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,866
MEETING WAS THE REDUCTION OF 

421
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,100
NUCLEAR WEAPONS THROUGHOUT THE 

422
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,070
WORLD. 

423
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,104
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA, 

424
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:36,141
90 PERCENT AS I SAID. WE CAN 

425
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,376
HAVE A BIG IMPACT BUT NUCLEAR 

426
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,410
WEAPONS IS THE GREATEST THREAT 

427
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,348
OF OUR WORLD TODAY. 

428
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,282
THEY ARE A GREAT NUCLEAR POWER 

429
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,016
AND WE ARE A GREAT NUCLEAR 

430
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:46,352
POWER. 

431
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:53,659
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT 

432
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:53,859
IT. 

433
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,094
THAT WAS A MATTER THAT WE 

434
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,095
DISCUSSED IN GREAT DETAIL AND 

435
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,129
PRESIDENT PUTIN AGREES WITH ME. 

436
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,130
THE MATTERS THAT WE DISCUSSED 

437
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,401
ARE PROFOUND AND IMPORTANT AND 

438
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,602
THEY HAD THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE 

439
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,404
MILLIONS OF LIVES. 

440
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,238
I UNDERSTAND MANY DISAGREEMENTS 

441
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,273
BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES AND I 

442
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:13,445
ALSO UNDERSTAND THE DIALOGUE 

443
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,546
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE 

444
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,547
DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA OR WITH 

445
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,382
OTHER COUNTRIES, DIALOGUE WITH 

446
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,251
RUSSIA IN THIS CASE WHERE WE 

447
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,552
HAVE HAD SUCH SQUARE 

448
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,921
RELATIONSHIPS, DIALOGUE IS VERY 

449
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,590
IMPORTANT AND IT IS A GOOD 

450
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,658
THING. 

451
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,558
IF WE GET ALONG WITH THEM 

452
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,793
GREAT, IF WE DON'T GET ALONG 

453
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,829
THEN WE DON'T GET ALONG. 

454
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,264
I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE 

455
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,299
OF HAVING SOME POSITIVE THINGS. 

456
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:35,501
I THOUGHT THAT THE MEETING THAT 

457
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,269
I HAD WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN WAS 

458
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,338
REALLY STRONG. THEY WERE 

459
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,939
WILLING TO DO THINGS THAT 

460
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,975
FRANKLY I WAS NOT SURE THEY 

461
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:48,680
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO. WE WILL 

462
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,681
BE HAVING FUTURE MEETINGS AND 

463
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,549
WE WILL SEE IF THAT COMES TO 

464
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:51,950
FRUITION. 

465
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,421
I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR UP, I 

466
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,257
HAVE THE STRONGEST RESPECT FOR 

467
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,292
OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES 

468
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,728
HEADED BY MY PEOPLE. 

469
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,164
WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE, WHETHER 

470
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:09,168
IT IS GINA, DAN COATS, WE HAVE 

471
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,804
TREMENDOUS PEOPLE, TREMENDOUS 

472
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:16,308
TALENT WITHIN THE AGENCY. 

473
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,009
I THINK THEY ARE BEING GUIDED 

474
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:20,379
PROPERLY. 

475
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,780
AND WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING 

476
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,550
WE WANT SUCCESS FOR OUR COUNTRY.

477
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,884
WITH THAT WE WILL START A 

478
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,720
MEETING ON TAX REDUCTIONS. 

479
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,355
WE ARE GOING TO PUT IN A BILL, 

480
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:31,390
KEVIN BRADY IS WITH US. 

481
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,425
I MIGHT ASK KEVIN TO SAY A 

482
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,626
COUPLE OF WORDS AND THEN WE 

483
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,328
WILL GET BACK TO OUR PRIVATE 

484
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,231
MEETING. 

485
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:43,569
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE 

486
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,504

PIECE THROUGH STRENGTH FOR FORM 

489
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,078
POLICY AND IT WORKS BEST WHEN 

490
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,079
AMERICA HAS A STRONG ECONOMY 

491
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,183
AND A STRONG MILITARY. 

492
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,184
UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP HOUSE AND 

493
00:16:59,184 --> 00:16:59,818
SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE 

494
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,254

495
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,789
ABOUT HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN 

496

AMERICANS -- AMERICA'S ECONOMY 

497
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:11,997
AND WE THINK THE BEST WAY TO 

498
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:12,998
START IS WITH MIDDLE-CLASS 

499
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:13,632
FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES. 

500
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,032
TODAY WE ARE HERE TO TALK TO 

501
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:16,267
ABOUT MAKING PERMANENT TAX 

502
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:18,670
RELIEF, ONE, SO THEY CAN 

503
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,707
CONTINUE TO GROW. 

504
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,342
TWO, SO WE CAN ADD 1,000,000 

505
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,309
1/2 JOBS. 

506
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:29,014
AND THREE, SO WE CAN PROTECT 

507
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,048
THEM FROM A FUTURE WASHINGTON 

508
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:33,218
TRYING TO STEAL BACK THOSE HARD 

509
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,286
EARNED DOLLARS. 

510
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:39,625
>> THE TIME OF SUBMITTAL? 

511
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,425
>>WE ANTICIPATE THE HOUSE 

512
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:43,896

>>AND WE JUST HEARD PRESIDENT 

517
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:05,017
TRUMP ADDRESSING THE CRITICISM 

518
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,018
OVER HIS SUMMIT WITH RUSSIA 

519
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,453
PRESIDENT LATIMER PUTIN. 

520
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:10,088
HE CAME OUT AND HE SAID I HAVE 

521
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:11,623
FULL SUPPORT FOR THE U. S. 

522
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:12,658
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND HE 

523
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,760
ALSO SAID THAT HE ACCEPTS THAT 

524
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,593
THERE WAS RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE 

525
00:18:15,593 --> 00:18:16,395
IN THE 2016 ELECTION. 

526
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,796
THERE WAS HOWEVER NO COLLUSION. 

527
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,766
I AM GOING TO BRING IN CBS NEWS 

528
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,666
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, ED 

529
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,070
O'KEEFE. 

530
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,304
ED, WE DID HEAR THE PRESIDENT 

531
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:27,673
DISCUSS HIS MEETING WITH 

532
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,142
VLADIMIR PUTIN AND ALSO WITH 

533
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:30,576
NATO LEADERS. 

534
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,977
AT ONE POINT HE SAID PEOPLE MAY 

535
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,213
HAVE CRITICIZED ME FOR BEING A 

536
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,447
LITTLE HARSH WITH NATO LEADERS 

537
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,115
BUT THEY WERE NOT PAYING THEIR 

538
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,751
BILLS AND KNOW EVERYTHING IS 

539
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:39,951
FINE. 

540
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:41,987
AT NO POINT DID HE SAY HE EVER 

541
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,823
TOOK VLADIMIR PUTIN TO TASK FOR 

542
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,225
ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT THE U. 

543
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,059
S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS 

544
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:47,659
BROUGHT UP. 

545
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,096
>>THAT IS RIGHT. 

546
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,931
THIS WAS A CLASSIC CLEANUP JOB. 

547
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:56,001
YOU COULD ALMOST HEAR THE MOP 

548
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,203
HITTING THE FLOOR TRYING TO 

549
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,004
CLEAN UP THE MESS THAT HE HAS 

550
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:02,674
CREATED. JUST TRYING TO 

551
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:07,746
REITERATE THAT WHILE HE 

552
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:08,747
APPRECIATES AND HE AGREES WITH 

553
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,781
THE ASSESSMENT OF THE 

554
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:10,615
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND HIS 

555
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,184
FAITH IN THE LEADERSHIP OF 

556
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,286
THOSE AGENCIES. 

557
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,721
HE WAS SEEKING TO HAVE A BETTER 

558
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,957
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA. 

559
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,359
HE IS RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS HE 

560
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,593
CAMPAIGNED ON THIS, HE WANTS TO 

561
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,594
SEE THE UNITED STATES WORKING 

562
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,196
IN BETTER SPIRITS WITH RUSSIA 

563
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,866
AND CHINA. 

564
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,101
THAT COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF 

565
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,302
UPSETTING ALLIES ALL OVER THE 

566
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,136
WORLD AND THE NATO ALLIANCE 

567
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,338
THAT CAUSES GREAT PAUSE FOR SO 

568
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,740
MANY CRITICS AND MEMBERS OF HIS 

569
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,173
OWN PARTY. 

570
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,843
TELLING IN HIS FIRST STATEMENT 

571
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,178
IS THAT HE SAYS I ACCEPT THE 

572
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,614
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY -- 

573
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,349
COMMUNITY CONCLUSION AND HE 

574
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,186
ADDED IT COULD HAVE BEEN OTHER 

575
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:48,620
PEOPLE ALSO. 

576
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,821
IT IS THOSE QUALIFIERS THAT HE 

577
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:50,822
PUTS ON THESE STATEMENTS THAT 

578
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,323
AGGRAVATES CRITICS AND BRINGS 

579
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:55,026
CONCERN AND PAUSE TO REPUBLICAN 

580
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:58,997
ALLIES. AGAIN, IT DEMONSTRATES 

581
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,800
HE CANNOT FOR WHATEVER REASON 

582
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,634
EXCEPT THAT AS FACT AND 

583
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,036
CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT 

584
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,472
OTHERS WERE ALSO INVOLVED. 

585
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,707
WHEN YOU HAVE ALL OF THE 

586
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,307
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY SAYING 

587
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:12,744
OTHERWISE IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW 

588
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:13,144
THAT SQUARES? 

589
00:20:13,144 --> 00:20:16,214
>> WHO WHEN HE REFERRED TO? 

590
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:17,683
HE SAID A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE. 

591
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:18,684
WHO IS HE REFERRING TO? 

592
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,119
>> HE DOES NOT SAY. 

593
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,954
HE HAS NO EVIDENCE TO BACK IT 

594
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:28,026
UP. 

595
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,328
LOOK, ONCE AGAIN THEY ARE 

596
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:29,961
REITERATING THAT THEY DISCUSSED 

597
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:33,298
THE SITUATION WITH IRAN, RUSSIA 

598
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,333
AND ISRAEL ARE WORKING TOGETHER 

599
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,334
WHEN IT COMES TO SYRIA. 

600
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,667
THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS 

601
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,971
DISCUSSED AMONG SENATOR LINDSEY 

602
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:41,006
GRAHAM AND OTHER MEMBERS OF 

603
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,608
CONGRESS ABOUT THE COOPERATION. 

604
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:44,843
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE END OF 

605
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,613
THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM

606
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,747
AND REDUCING WEAPONS AND THEY 

607
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,248
SAID THEY WILL HAVE FUTURE 

608
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:51,216
MEETINGS. 

609
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,451
WHEN YOU HAVE A COUNTRY THAT 

610
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,252
SPANS 11 TIME ZONES TOUCHES ON 

611
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:55,887
THE MIDDLE EAST ALL THE WAY TO 

612
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,321
THE PACIFIC OCEAN IT IS 

613
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:58,924
INEVITABLE THAT THEY WILL 

614
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,160
DISCUSS A LOT OF ISSUES AND IT 

615
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,195
SEEMS LIKE THEY RAN THROUGH 

616
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,129
SEVERAL YESTERDAY. 

617
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,666
>>DOES IT SEEM TO YOU THAT THEY 

618
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,102
LOST OVER SYRIA? OBVIOUSLY THAT 

619
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,736
IS A POINT OF CONTENTION. 

620
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:15,340
>> HE DID NOT OFFER MUCH DETAIL 

621
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,910
AND THAT IS CONCERNING TO A LOT 

622
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,045
OF AMERICAN OFFICIALS AND OTHER 

623
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,482
OBSERVERS, WHAT DID HE DO OR SAY

624
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,550
, WHAT WAS DISCUSSED REGARDING 

625
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:32,457
RUSSIA'S WORK WITH ISRAEL AND 

626
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,458
ITS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN SYRIA 

627
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,892
AND UNITED STATES PRESENCE IN 

628
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:35,694
SYRIA. 

629
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,329
WE DO NOT KNOW AND HE DID NOT 

630
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:41,366
OFFER IT UP. 

631
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,401
FRANKLY, WE MAY NEVER KNOW. 

632
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,835
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE ALONG 

633
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:44,436
WITH THE TRANSLATOR. 

634
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,771
>>ALSO CONSIDERING THAT THIS 

635
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,873
MEETING CAME ON THE HEELS OF 

636
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,275
THE NATO SUMMIT THERE WAS NO 

637
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,711
MENTION OF A DISCUSSION OVER 

638
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,479
CRIMEA OR THE BALTIC STATES. 

639
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:58,250
>> REMEMBER PRESIDENT PUTIN 

640
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,718
SAYING IN HIS INTERVIEW THAT 

641
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,486
TRUMP RAISE THE ISSUE OF CRIMEA 

642
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,922
DURING THE MEETING AND THEY 

643
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,158
ESSENTIALLY AGREED TO DISAGREE. 

644
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,392
THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT 

645
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,028
IT CAME UP IF YOU BELIEVE 

646
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,263
PRESIDENT PUTIN IS CORRECT. 

647
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,499
IT DID COME UP IT IS JUST THAT 

648
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:19,137
HE DID NOT REITERATED AT HIS 

649
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:19,404
MEETING. 

650
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,171
INTERESTING IN HIS CONVERSATION 

651
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:21,573
WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS THAT 

652
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,308
THEY SUGGESTED THEY WILL HAVE A 

653
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:24,776
NEW PACKAGE OF POTENTIAL TAX 

654
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,879
REFORM PROPOSALS READY TO VOTE 

655
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,481
IN THE HOUSE IN SEPTEMBER. 

656
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,515
THAT WAS THE OFFICIAL REASON 

657
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,585
FOR THAT MEETING. PERHAPS BY 

658
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,153
HAVING REPORTERS COME IN FOR 

659
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:40,492
THAT PERHAPS IT WILL MOVE OFF 

660
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,726
OF THIS CONCERN THAT WENT ON 

661
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:47,799
DURING THE OVERSEAS TRIP. 

662
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,834
WE HAVE SEEN PRESIDENTS AND 

663
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:49,835
OTHER POLITICAL LEADERS HAVE TO 

664
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,670
DO THIS BEFORE, THIS WAS A BIT 

665
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,872
OF A CLEANUP ACT. 

666
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,273
WE WILL SEE IF IT HELPS REPAIR 

667
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:55,707
THE DAMAGE. 

668
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,544
>>HE SEEMED TO BE VERY FOCUSED 

669
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,579
ON ONE PARTICULAR STATEMENT 

670
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,781
THAT HE FEELS WAS MISUNDERSTOOD 

671
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:03,214
OR MISREAD. 

672
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:06,885
THAT STATEMENT ABOUT I SEE NO 

673
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:07,919
REASON TO NOT BELIEVE THAT 

674
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,755
RUSSIA WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE. 

675
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:11,957
WHY WAS HE SO CONCERNED WITH 

676
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,992
THAT ONE STATEMENT? 

677
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:16,027
>>HE SAID HE WENT BACK AND HE 

678
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,562
READ THE TRANSCRIPT AND HE SAW 

679
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,030
THE CLIPS AND REALIZED IT COULD 

680
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:24,369
BE MISCONSTRUED. 

681
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,871
WHAT HE SAYS HE SHOULD HAVE 

682
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:26,972
SAID WAS QUOTE, I DON'T SEE ANY 

683
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,006
REASON WHY IT WOULDN'T BE 

684
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,007
RUSSIA UNQUOTE WHO MEDDLED IN 

685
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,243
THE 2016 ELECTIONS. WHEN YOU 

686
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,077
DON'T SAY WOULDN'T AND YOU SAY 

687
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:36,915
WOULD THAT IS A TOTALLY 

688
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:37,382
DIFFERENT STATEMENT. 

689
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:38,783
WHAT HE IS TRYING TO SUGGEST IS 

690
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:40,952
YES RUSSIA DID THIS I DON'T SEE 

691
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,454
WHY NOT. 

692
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,456
HE IS JUST TRYING TO CLEAN UP 

693
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,725
THAT PIECE. WHETHER HE COPOUT 

694
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:50,161
HIMSELF OR IF THAT WAS AT THE 

695
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:51,462
URGING OF OTHERS REMAINS 

696
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:52,964
UNCLEAR. 

697
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:59,271
ALSO WE WILL STOP IT AND REPEL 

698
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,705
ANY ATTEMPT TO MEDDLE IN THE U. 

699
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:01,105
S. ELECTIONS. 

700
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:02,340
THAT IS A BOLD STATEMENT WE 

701
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,542
WILL SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. 

702
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:07,412
ALL OF THAT FOR POTENTIAL 

703
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,046
HEARINGS, CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE 

704
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,648
AT THE CAPITAL IN THE COMING 

705
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:09,848
<u>EEKS. </u>

706
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,249
DEMOCRATS INSIST THAT SECRETARY 

707
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,785
OF STATE POMPEO AND OTHER 

708
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,788
OFFICIALS COME BEFORE TO 

709
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,789
EXPLAIN WHAT THEY DID TO 

710
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,624
PREPARE THE PRESIDENT WHAT THEY 

711
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,625
DID DURING THE MEETINGS AND 

712
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:25,931
AFTER THE MEETINGS. 

713
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,132
BOB CORKER SAID TODAY THAT HE 

714
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,133
IS ARRANGING TO HAVE THE 

715
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,634
SECRETARY OF STATE COME NEXT 

716
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,970
WEEK. 

717
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,405
YOU WILL SEE WHAT ELSE WE WILL 

718
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,406
LEARN THERE IS LEGISLATION ON 

719
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,242
THE TABLE AND WILL PUNISH 

720
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,276
RUSSIA FOR MEDDLING AGAIN IN 

721
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:38,843
THE MIDTERM ELECTION. 

722
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:43,348
úTHAT IS  

723
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,616
WE WILL SEE IF THAT GETS 

724
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:44,883
MOVEMENT. 

725
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,184
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 

726
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,453
McCONNELL SAID IT IS AMONG THE 

727
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:49,888
PROPOSALS THAT COULD BE WORTH 

728
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:50,288
VOTING ON. 

729
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,923
I THINK YOU WILL SEE A PUSH OF 

730
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,324
MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES AND 

731
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:55,760
CHAMBERS TO TRY TO GET SOME 

732
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,029
KIND OF DEBATE GOING TO 

733
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,364
REITERATE AT LEAST CONGRESSES 

734
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,666
BELIEF THAT RUSSIA IS A BAD 

735
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:05,103
ACTOR WHEN IT COMES TO THIS AND 

736
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,304
THAT THEY SHOULD BE AND WOULD 

737
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,872
BE PUNISHED IF IT HAPPENS 

738
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:08,740
AGAIN. 

739
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,008
>>IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 

740
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,776
IF THE SANCTIONS GAIN TRACTION. 

741
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,011
WAS THERE ANY EXPLANATION AS TO 

742
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,679
WHY THE LEADERS HAD TO MEET 

743
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,613
PRIVATELY? 

744
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:19,117
>> REPORTING FROM OUR 

745
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:23,088
COLLEAGUES AND OTHER OUTLETS 

746
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:23,822
SUGGEST THAT THE PRESIDENT 

747
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,223
WANTED TO DO IT IN PART BECAUSE 

748
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,858
HE WAS CONCERNED OF LEAKS FROM 

749
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,226
PREVIOUS MEETINGS WITH OTHER 

750
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,295
WORLD LEADERS. 

751
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,329
THAT AT LEAST IS ONE 

752
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,865
EXPLANATION THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN.

753
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,400
WHY OFFICIALS WOULD CONSENT TO 

754
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,968
IT OR WHETHER THEY REALLY 

755
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,604
PUSHED HARD TO HAVE IT BE 

756
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,840
OTHERWISE REMAINS UNCLEAR. 

757
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,475
REMEMBER THEY DID HAVE A LUNCH 

758
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,943
AFTERWARD WHERE THEY DID MEET 

759
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,545
WITH THEIR OTHER TOP AIDES. 

760
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,482
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO MET 

761
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,482
WITH THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN 

762
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:58,523
MINISTER AND -- WAS MEETING 

763
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,557
WITH OTHER OFFICIALS AS WELL. 

764
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,326
FOR TWO HOURS THEY WERE ALONE 

765
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:01,993
WITH TRANSLATORS. 

766
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,028
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 

767
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,664
DEMOCRATS SUGGESTED TODAY IS 

768
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,065
THAT THE NOTES OF THE U. S. 

769
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,499
INTERPRETER THAT WAS WITH THE 

770
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:11,136
PRESIDENT MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE 

771
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,537
PUBLIC TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF 

772
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:13,138
WHAT WENT ON. 

773
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,139
WHETHER THE INTERPRETER HAS THE 

774
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:17,208
TIME AND TAKES A NOTE DURING OR 

775
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,445
RIGHT AFTER IS UNCLEAR TO ME. 

776
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:21,646
AT LEAST AN ATTEMPT TO FIGURE 

777
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,281
OUT WHAT WAS SAID AND DONE. 

778
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,949
>> I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT CBS 

779
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:26,250

THAT THE WITNESSES IDENTITIES 

787
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,199
REMAIN SECRET. 

788
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:46,037
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THIS? 

789
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,272
>> THIS SUGGEST THAT THE BALL 

790
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:47,973

I AM TRYING TO FIND THAT 

792
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,109
GUIDANCE. I KNOW IT CAME IN A 

793
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:57,015

THEY ARE NOT -- IF THEY DO NOT 

799
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,226

SELF-INCRIMINATION.

THEY WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO

811
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,479

THAT CONTINUES IN FEDERAL COURT 

813

IN VIRGINIA. 

814
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,515
THAT IS A TRIAL SET TO BEGIN A 

815
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,117
WEEK TOMORROW IN THE EASTERN 

816
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,819

WITH US NOW. 

825
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,433
DO YOU THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT 

826
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,903
DID ENOUGH DAMAGE CONTROL? 

827
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,271
DO YOU THINK HE DID ENOUGH TO 

828
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,305
SATISFY HIS CRITICS BOTH AMONG 

829
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,107
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS?

>> I THINK IT IS TOO SOON TO 

831
00:27:58,175 --> 00:27:59,277
TELL. 

832
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,945
RIGHT NOW WHAT WE HAVE IS A 

833
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,014
WALKED BACK AND IT IS DUE 

834
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,682
DILIGENCE FOR WHAT HE HAD TO 

835
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:08,353
CORRECT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED 

836
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:08,653
YESTERDAY. 

837
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:09,921
WE KNEW THAT SENIOR 

838
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:10,555
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WERE 

839
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:11,790
REALLY PRESSING HIM TO CLEAN 

840
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,190
THIS UP. 

841
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,625
IT WAS MOST IMPORTANT FOR THEM 

842
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,861
THAT HE DECLARE THAT HE 

843
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,129
BELIEVED THE U. S. INTELLIGENCE 

844
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:21,132
COMMUNITY OVER VLADIMIR PUTIN. 

845
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,767
EVEN THOUGH HE DID NOT SAY THAT 

846
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,369
EXPLICITLY, HE DID MAKE REALLY 

847
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,606
IMPORTANT POINTS THAT CORRECT 

848
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,641
WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY DURING 

849
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,477
THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 

850
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,912
HE SAID HE HAS THE FULL FAITH 

851
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,113
AND SUPPORT IN THE U. S. 

852
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:35,914
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHICH HE 

853
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:36,948
HAS BEEN SAYING, HERE'S THE 

854
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,583
DIFFERENCE, FOR THE FIRST TIME 

855
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:42,453
WHICH WE DID NOT HEAR YESTERDAY 

856
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:43,888
IS THAT HE SAID HE ACCEPTED THE 

857
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,589
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY'S 

858
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:45,290
CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS IN 

859
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,359
FACT MEDDLING IN THE ELECTION. 

860
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,761
HE ALSO WENT ON TO SAY THAT 

861
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:50,595
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. 

862
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:56,267
IT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE 

863
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,101
PRESIDENT TO MAKE THAT 

864
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:57,534
DISTINCTION BETWEEN 

865
00:28:57,534 --> 00:28:58,135
INTERFERENCE AND COLLUSION. 

866
00:28:58,135 --> 00:28:58,703
>> I AGREE. 

867
00:28:58,703 --> 00:28:59,904
HE NEVER POINTED OUT THAT HE 

868
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,941
PRESSED PRESIDENT PUTIN DURING 

869
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:03,575
ANY OF THIS. 

870
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,976
>> YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. 

871
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:08,513
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE SAID. 

872
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:09,647
HE ALSO SAID THAT HE MISSPOKE 

873
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:10,648
DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND 

874
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:14,352
HE MEANT TO SAY I DON'T SEE ANY 

875
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,120
REASON TO SAY WHY IT WOULDN'T 

876
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,388
BE RUSSIA. 

877
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:18,422
I HAVE THE OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT 

878
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:19,657
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IN FRONT 

879
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:20,024
OF ME. 

880
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:23,294
THE POINT IS, AFTER THAT HE 

881
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,696
SAID HE HAD GREAT CONFIDENCE IN 

882
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:28,566
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY BUT 

883
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,400
ALSO PRESIDENT PUTIN WAS 

884
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,802
EXTREMELY STRONG AND POWERFUL 

885
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:34,005
IN HIS DENIAL TODAY. 

886
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,640
IF HE HAD MADE THAT CLAIM AS HE 

887
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,275
THOUGHT HE DID, WHICH I DON'T 

888
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:42,347
SEE WHY IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN 

889
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,581
-- WOULD HAVE BEEN RUSSIA WHY 

890
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:44,615
DID YOU NOT DENOUNCE VLADIMIR 

891
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:45,850
PUTIN RIGHT THERE ON THE SPOT 

892
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,951
WHEN HE WAS NEXT YEAR. 

893
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,987
HE DID NOT DO THAT TODAY EITHER.

894
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,055
HE DID NOT DELIVER A MESSAGE TO 

895
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,359
PUTIN THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT 

896
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,093
YOU MAY HAVE THINK I CONVEYED 

897
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:59,030
YESTERDAY THE BOTTOM LINE IS 

898
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,465
THAT THE U. S. WILL NOT ACCEPT 

899
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,866
THIS AND WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID. 

900
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,468
I ACCEPT WHAT MY INVESTIGATORS 

901
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,736
HAVE FOUND AND THERE WILL BE 

902
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,504
CONSEQUENCES IN THE FUTURE. 

903
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,739
ALL OF THAT TOUGH LANGUAGE WE 

904
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,574
DID IN HERE. 

905
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,575
>>WE HEARD THE TOUGH LANGUAGE 

906
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,410
WHEN IT CAME TO NATO AND 

907
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:17,682
LEADERS NOT PAYING THEIR BILLS 

908
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:18,950
BUT WE DID NOT HEAR THAT 

909
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,951
LANGUAGE WHEN IT COMES TO 

910
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,252
CALLING OUT PRESIDENT PUTIN. 

911
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,387
>>PRECISELY. 

912
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,421
THIS WAS ANOTHER VICTORY LAP 

913
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:24,622
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IN TERMS OF 

914
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,391
NATO SAYING IT IS BECAUSE OF 

915
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:31,129
HIS RHETORIC AND HIS DEMANDS 

916
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,163
THAT THESE COUNTRIES ARE NOW 

917
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,631
COMMITTED TO PAYING THEIR FAIR 

918
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:38,036
SHARE AND SO HE SAID THAT WAS 

919
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,037
IMPORTANT TO GET THE RESULT 

920
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,638
THAT HE WANTED. 

921
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,873
BUT HE COULD HAVE USED THAT 

922
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,708
SAME TOUGH LANGUAGE FOR 

923
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,909
VLADIMIR PUTIN TO SEND A 

924
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,779
MESSAGE THAT THE RESULT HAS TO 

925
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,180
BE YOU DO NOT DO THIS AGAIN 

926
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,815
ESPECIALLY WITH OUR MIDTERM 

927
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,049
ELECTIONS RIGHT AROUND THE 

928
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:53,885
CORNER. 

929
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,721
HE WAS NOT FORCEFUL. 

930
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,289
AND DESPITE EVERYTHING HE SAID 

931
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,591
TODAY, REMEMBER THAT MOUNTAIN 

932
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:03,227
OF PRESSURE FOR HIM TO DO SO, 

933
00:31:03,227 --> 00:31:05,863
WE ALL WATCHED WHAT HAPPENED 

934
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:07,632
WHEN HE WAS STANDING NEXT TO 

935
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,399
VLADIMIR PUTIN. 

936
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,967
HE STILL HAS TO ANSWER MANY 

937
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:12,637
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY HE DID NOT 

938
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:16,808
EXPRESS THAT TO PUTIN IF HE DID

939
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,442
, IN FACT, BELIEVE THERE WAS 

940
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:21,279
MEDDLING. 

941
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,279
DOES THAT MEAN HE WAS 

942
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,413
COMPLACENT IN RUSSIA'S 

943
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:23,747
INTERFERENCE? 

944
00:31:23,747 --> 00:31:26,985
IF NOT WHY DID HE NOT PRESS HIM 

945
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,419
IF HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY ON THE 

946
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,054
WORLD STAGE TO DO THAT? 

947
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,823
THAT IS SOMETHING HE HAS NOT 

948
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,725
ANSWERED.

ABOUT WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AND

WHY THE PRESIDENT IGNORED THE

ADVICE AND THE INFORMATION THAT 

984
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,359

MAJORITY LEADER, MITCH 

989
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:54,105
McCONNELL, COMING OUT AT HIS 

990
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,473
WEEKLY PRESS CONFERENCE AND 

991
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,541
FEELING COMPELLED TO SEND A 

992
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,808
MESSAGE DIRECTLY TO EUROPE 

993
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:00,411
REASSURING OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES 

994
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,448
THAT WE ARE THEIR FRIENDS AND 

995
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,116
THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE NOT OUR 

996
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,918
FRIENDS. 

997
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,352
I ASKED HIM WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT 

998
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,188
THE STATE OF OUR GOVERNMENT 

999
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,856
THAT HE HAD TO ISSUE THAT 

1000
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,025
REASSURANCE, SURELY THE 

1001
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,793
EUROPEAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE 

1002
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:20,531
FOR GRANTED THAT WE ARE THEIR 

1003
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:20,798
FRIENDS. 

1004
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,166
HE SAID IT IS ALWAYS NICE TO 

1005
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,734
REMIND YOUR LONGTIME FRIENDS OF 

1006
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:27,605
THAT SOLIDARITY EVERY ONCE IN A 

1007
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:27,838
WHILE. 

1008
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:28,840
CLEARLY THOSE ARE NOT WORDS 

1009
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,841
THAT THE MAJORITY LEADER EVER 

1010
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,642
THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE TO UTTER. 

1011
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:35,445
IT IS A SIGN AT HOW PERTURBED 

1012
00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:38,415
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE 

1013
00:33:38,415 --> 00:33:40,150
OVER WHAT THEY SAW IN HELSINKI 

1014
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:44,522
YESTERDAY. ONE CORRECTION FROM 

1015
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,723
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING TO 

1016
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:46,591
CHANGE THAT. 

1017
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,293
>>I ALSO THINK AT THIS POINT IT 

1018
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,995
IS EASY TO INFER, THIS WOULD 

1019
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,431
HAVE BEEN THE MOMENT TO SAY IT 

1020
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,066
THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT PUSH 

1021
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,734
VLADIMIR PUTIN ON ANY OF THESE 

1022
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,136
POINTS. 

1023
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:02,240
ONE CAN INFER HAD HE PUSHED HIM 

1024
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,174
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOMENT 

1025
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,809
TO SAY I TOLD HIM HE CANNOT DO 

1026
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:05,009
THIS. 

1027
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,011
HE HAS NOT SAID THAT. 

1028
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,646
IT IS EASY TO INFER THAT HE DID 

1029
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,447
NOT BRING IT UP. 

1030
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,382
>> I SHOULD BRING UP EVEN IN 

1031
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:15,286
THE SO-CALLED CORRECTION, THE 

1032
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,754
VERY NEXT BREATH AFTER THE 

1033
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,056
PRESIDENT SAID I TRUST OUR 

1034
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:19,857
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HE WENT 

1035
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,558
ON TO SAY THAT RUSSIA 

1036
00:34:21,558 --> 00:34:25,129
INTERFERENCE DID NOT CHANGE THE 

1037
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,599
OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION, IT DID 

1038
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,168
NOT INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME IN 

1039
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,034
ANY WAY. 

1040
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:32,036
THAT IS NOT WITH THE 

1041
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,839
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY FOUND. 

1042
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:35,473
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 

1043
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,873
FOUND THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO 

1044
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:39,310
KNOW HOW RUSSIA INTERFERENCE 

1045
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,878
AFFECTED AN ELECTION THAT WAS 

1046
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,850
THIS CLOSE. 

1047
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,284
IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

1048
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:48,485
UNITED STATES YOU CANNOT SAY I 

1049
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,119
TRUST THE INTELLIGENCE 

1050
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,321
COMMUNITY BUT I AM ONLY GOING 

1051
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,355
TO CHERRY PICK THE INFORMATION 

1052
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,556
THAT THEY GATHERED THAT I LIKE 

1053
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,425
AND THE REST OF IT I WILL 

1054
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,594
DISCARD AND CREATE MY OWN 

1055
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:56,827
TRUTH. 

1056
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:58,495
THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS. 

1057
00:34:58,495 --> 00:35:00,665
>>WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT 

1058
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:01,299
INTERFERENCE THAT THE 

1059
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,299
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS 

1060
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:03,534
FOUND. 

1061
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,603
THERE ARE INTANGIBLES TO THAT. 

1062
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:10,007
HE ALSO SAID COULD HAVE BEEN 

1063
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,509
OTHER PEOPLE TOO, LOTS OF OTHER 

1064
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:12,643
PEOPLE OUT THERE, IT WAS SORT 

1065
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,680
OF A QUALIFIER TO HIS 

1066
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,048
ACCEPTANCE OF THE INTELLIGENCE 

1067
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,784
COMMUNITIES ASSESSMENT. 

1068
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,353
WHAT DID THAT MEAN? 

1069
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:28,092
>>THAT MEANS THAT HE IS STILL 

1070
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:28,693
UNWILLING, DESPITE THE 

1071
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:29,727
INFORMATION THAT HE HAS BEEN 

1072
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,395
GIVEN REPEATEDLY OVER THE PAST 

1073
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:33,531
TWO YEARS TO CONFIRM THAT IT 

1074
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,833
WAS RUSSIA AND RUSSIA ALONE 

1075
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,069
THAT PLAYED THIS MAJOR ROLE IN 

1076
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,672
THE 2016 ELECTION. 

1077
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,107
IT IS UNCLEAR WHY HE FEELS THE 

1078
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:45,142
NEED TO DILUTE THAT WHEN HE 

1079
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:47,778
DOES AGREE THAT IT WAS RUSSIA. 

1080
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,180
HE HASN'T DONE IT IN THE PAST 

1081
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,483
FROM TIME TO TIME HE ALWAYS 

1082
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,484
PUTS IN THE QUALIFIER THAT 

1083
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,019
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN OTHERS AS 

1084
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,155
WELL OR THAT THE U. S. -- WHICH 

1085
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:59,590
IS TYPICALLY NOT WITH THE U. S. 

1086
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,191
PRESIDENT WOULD ADMIT 

1087
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,426
ESPECIALLY A PRESIDENT WHO WENT 

1088
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,029
SO FAR ON HIS PREDECESSOR 

1089
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,898
SAYING THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD 

1090
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:11,869
GONE AN APOLOGY TOUR OF THE 

1091
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:12,169
WORLD. 

1092
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:13,371
THAT IS PART OF THE REASON THAT 

1093
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,939
YOU ARE SEEING THIS GROUNDSWELL 

1094
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,441
TODAY AMONG REPUBLICANS IN 

1095
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:18,242
SUPPORT OF A PIECE OF 

1096
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,243
LEGISLATION THAT WAS NOT GOING 

1097
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:22,113
ANYWHERE UNTIL THIS WEEK. 

1098
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,314
IT HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD BY 

1099
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,548
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO OF FLORIDA, 

1100
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:24,848
REPUBLICAN. 

1101
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:27,385
CHRIS VAN HOLLEN A DEMOCRAT 

1102
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,854
FROM MARYLAND AND IT WOULD GIVE 

1103
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,291
CONGRESS THE POWER TO IMPOSE 

1104
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,591
NEW SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA 

1105
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:41,632
UNILATERALLY IF RUSSIA MEDALS 

1106
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:42,633
IN THE 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS 

1107
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,067
OR THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL 

1108
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:44,869
ELECTIONS. 

1109
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,903
THAT IS A CLEAR SIGN. 

1110
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,438
YOU EVEN HEARD MITCH McCONNELL 

1111
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,941
SAY TODAY THAT HE IS INTERESTED 

1112
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:51,575
IN THAT LEGISLATION. 

1113
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:52,977
THAT IS MEANT TO SEND A SIGNAL 

1114
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,611
TO THE PRESIDENT AND TO THE 

1115
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:56,647
RUSSIANS, WE DO NOT TRUST THAT 

1116
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,449
THE RUSSIANS WILL NOT TRY THIS 

1117
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,518
AGAIN AND WE DO NOT TRUST THAT 

1118
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,552
OUR OWN PRESIDENT, THE LEADER 

1119
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,588
OF OUR OWN PARTY WOULD BE 

1120
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:05,589
WILLING TO ISSUE WARNINGS TO 

1121
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:06,824
RUSSIA OR TO PUNISH THEM IF 

1122
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,060
THEY WERE TO TRY THIS AGAIN. 

1123
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,494
YOU HAVE GOT REPUBLICANS IN 

1124
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,531
CONGRESS SAYING THAT THEY NEED 

1125
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,299
TO TAKE THINGS INTO THEIR OWN 

1126
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:15,766
HANDS. 

1127
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,801
>> DO YOU THINK THE LEGISLATION 

1128
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:18,835
WILL BE SUCCESSFUL? 

1129
00:37:18,835 --> 00:37:23,474
>> IT IS POSSIBLE. 

1130
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:24,875
IT WAS NOT ON THE RADAR SCREEN 

1131
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,310
24 HOURS AGO SO IT WILL TAKE 

1132
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,312
TIME TO MARINATE. 

1133
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,747
WE NEED TO SEE IF THIS ISSUE 

1134
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,881
REMAINS IN THE FOREFRONT FOR 

1135
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,016
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 

1136
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,050
THE FACT THAT THE SENATE 

1137
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,418
MAJORITY LEADER IS TALKING 

1138
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,722
ABOUT IT, IT IS USUALLY A 

1139
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:38,923
PRETTY GOOD SIGN THAT THIS IS 

1140
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,157
LEGISLATION THAT HE WAS 

1141
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,792
SERIOUSLY -- HE IS SERIOUSLY 

1142
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:45,029
BRINGING TO THE FOREFRONT. 

1143
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,064
-- THAT HE IS NOT PREPARED TO 

1144
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,500
SEE MOVED TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND 

1145
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,268
BEYOND THAT THERE IS ALSO TALK 

1146
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,137
OF PERHAPS SOME KIND OF 

1147
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:53,938
RESOLUTION THAT CONGRESS COULD 

1148
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,774
PASS REITERATING SUPPORT FOR 

1149
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,909
THE U. S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY

1150
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,445
AND ITS FINDINGS SINCE THE 

1151
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,046
PRESIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE SUCH A 

1152
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:06,150
TENUOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FOR 

1153
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,718
THOSE FINDINGS DEPENDING ON THE 

1154
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,754
DAY. 

1155
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,021
>>THIS IS ONE PIECE OF 

1156
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:11,621
BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION THAT 

1157
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:13,224
COULD HAVE A FUTURE. 

1158
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,925
NANCY CORTEZ THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

1159
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:20,197
>>CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT 

1160

ELIZABETH PALMER JOINS US NOW 

1161
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:22,600
FROM MOSCOW. 

1162
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,368
HOW HAS MOSCOW BEEN REACTING TO 

1163
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:32,943
THE SUMMIT? 

1164
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:33,744
>> Reporter: YESTERDAY THEY 

1165
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:34,144
WERE DELIGHTED. 

1166
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:35,146
IN FACT THE RUSSIA FOREIGN 

1167
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,647
MINISTER RIGHT AFTER THE TALKS 

1168
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,816
FINISHED SAID TO ONE OF THE 

1169
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,284
RUSSIAN MAGAZINES, VERY KREMLIN 

1170
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,919
FRIENDLY MAGAZINE, THESE TALKS 

1171
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,921
WERE BETTER THAN SUPER HE USED 

1172
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,190
THE RUSSIAN WORD THAT MEANS 

1173
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,591
FABULOUS. 

1174
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,227
THEY WERE OVER THE MOON AND 

1175
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,463
VARIOUS SENIOR POLITICIANS SAID 

1176
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:55,699
THIS IS A TURNAROUND MOMENT. 

1177
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:56,934
WE ARE GOING TO RESET THE 

1178
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,937
RELATIONSHIP AND SO ON. 

1179
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:00,971
BY THIS MORNING THE SOBER 

1180
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,472
VOICES LOOKING AT THE BACKLASH 

1181
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:04,809
AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

1182
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,177
PERFORMANCE IN THE UNITED 

1183
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,645
STATES SAID THIS MAY NOT BE SO 

1184
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:10,514
GOOD AFTER ALL BECAUSE IT MAY 

1185
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,984
MAKE TALKS WITH RUSSIA SO TOXIC 

1186
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,485
THAT WE CANNOT GET ANOTHER 

1187
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:15,820
ROUND. 

1188
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,855
THE RUSSIANS REALLY WANT WHAT 

1189
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,491
HAPPEN IN HELSINKI TO BE THE 

1190
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,127
FIRST STEP IN A WHOLE SERIES OF 

1191
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,361
TALKS AND SUMMITS AND 

1192
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:27,398
NEGOTIATIONS THAT WOULD 

1193
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,399
ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE LIFTING 

1194
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,700
OF SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA. 

1195
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,872
>>WHAT MORE HAVE YOU HEARD IN 

1196
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,307
TERMS OF DETAIL OUT OF THAT TO 

1197
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:36,707
OUR MEETING? 

1198
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,808
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE 

1199
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,910
SOME THINGS ING REPORTED IN THE 

1200
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,648
RUSSIA PRESS THAT WE HAVE NOT 

1201
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:45,683
HAD REPORTED HERE ABOUT WHAT 

1202
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:50,521
THEY TALKED ABOUT. 

1203
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:56,660
>> Reporter: THE RUSSIANS ARE 

1204
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,862
PUTTING A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON 

1205
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:58,896
ARMS CONTROL TALKS AND ALSO 

1206
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,731
SOME SORT OF AN ARRANGEMENT IN 

1207
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:05,202
SYRIA. 

1208
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,470
THEY ARE SPECULATING THAT IT 

1209
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,605
MAY MEAN ASKING THE U. S. TO 

1210
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:13,277
PULL RIGHT OUT OF SYRIA AND IN 

1211
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,311
RETURN FOR RUSSIA TAKING OVER 

1212
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:17,114
AND TRYING TO CORRAL IRAN INTO 

1213
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,817
THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY, AWAY 

1214
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,118
FROM THE ISRAELI BORDER. 

1215
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:25,689
>>SO THERE WAS DISCUSSION OVER 

1216
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:26,290
MIDDLE EASTERN POLICY. 

1217
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,525
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THE 

1218
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,693
DISCUSSION WITH NORTH KOREA? 

1219
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,796
>> YES. 

1220
00:40:32,796 --> 00:40:33,831
>> WHAT DID YOU HEAR? 

1221
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:39,870
>> NO MORE THAN, PRETTY MUCH AS 

1222
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,541
YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT RUSSIA 

1223
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,742
SAID A LOT OF PLATITUDES WHICH 

1224
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:54,018
ARE ALSO TRUE ON HOW NORTH KOREA

1225
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,619
NEEDS TO SCALE BACK THEIR 

1226
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:01,258
WEAPONS -- BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD 

1227
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:02,826
ANY DETAILS THAT RUSSIA WOULD 

1228
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:06,330
TAKE THE LEAD. 

1229
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,798
FOR THE MOMENT NO DETAIL. 

1230
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,001
>>REMIND US WHAT IS THE 

1231
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,403
KREMLIN'S OFFICIAL STANCE ON

THE ALEXA -- ELECTION MEDDLING? 

1233
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:23,948
>> Reporter: DIDN'T DO IT. 

1234
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,015
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING 

1235
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:25,282
ABOUT. 

1236
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,650
WE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE 

1237
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:26,850
THAT. 

1238
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:30,888
THEY ACTUALLY LINE UP WITH 

1239
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,122
DONALD TRUMP OR AT LEAST THE 

1240
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:33,123
POSITION THAT HE APPEARE TO 

1241
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,159

WEAKEN HIM BY ATTACKING HIM 

1246
00:41:55,245 --> 00:42:01,352
WITH THE FACTS OF THE INQUIRY. 

1247
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,786
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT.

WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

1249
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:04,454
BREAK.
