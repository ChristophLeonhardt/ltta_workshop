this project you've built a lot of other

energy projects you've watched all the

industries you just talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

have been credible for the country and

<font color="#E5E5E5">for Massachusetts do you feel like there</font>

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,560
are just much higher hurdles for this

again are rushing to throw things in the

England for 35 years and and we were one

generation in this region and we

16
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:48,390
developed six major projects and every

what the alternatives are and when we

were developing natural gas-fired

00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,060
projects other people were proposing

coal-fired power plants clearly we
