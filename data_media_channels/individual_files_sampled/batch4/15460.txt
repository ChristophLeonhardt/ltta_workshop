we should have seen this coming with identity politics and the micro aggression and outrage over gender specific pronouns now no more king or queen so take off that crown and let's chat coming up today on the Hollywood conservative or the rebel any of you rebels out there Purdue University alumni if so you are probably not going to like what my video is about today because let me tell you if it was my alma mater Auburn University I would yank my alumni donations faster than you can say non-binary cisgender so Purdue University I don't think we ever played them when I was at Auburn in sports so my knowledge of the university is relatively limited there Big Ten I believe in Auburn was SEC so we didn't really meet them on the field or on the court very often so I don't know were they a liberal school it's Indiana so I wouldn't think that they are an evergreen state Berkeley type campus but this story has me wondering so Purdue is about a hundred and fifty year old university made possible by land grants by Abraham Lincoln well Lincoln strikes me as a man who appreciates and Revere's tradition so I think over this Lincoln might be rolling over in his grave maybe not as much as he regrets purchasing that theater ticket but you know so Purdue after decades and decades has done away with their homecoming king and queen titles they will now just be called homecoming royalty and I'm sure you can guess why yes because they want to be more gender inclusive but here's my thing you don't have to do away with the titles you don't have to do away with king and queen if you've got somebody who identifies as multiple or both genders then they have doubled a chance of winning the title so they can be king or queen now again they stated that they are doing this to be more gender inclusive and again I'll remind you there are only two genders I'm a chick I can't be a dude and I okay with being exclusively female and don't talk to me about gender reassignment surgery it changes nothing you can change the pipes but you cannot change the plumbing but why even have homecoming in general I mean home the word home has multiple definitions including concepts like ownership of property the family unit and where someone belongs so isn't that discriminatory I mean America is my home but that might hurt somebody is feeling so maybe we should say homecoming at all because that sounds a whole lot like privilege to me what do you think have we gone too far in the name of inclusivity I think that we have blurred the lines and distorted things so much so that Rachel Dolezal is black kanye west is at an Uncle Tom and anyone who doesn't violently oppose Donald Trump is a far-right winger well I guess I am for sure a right winger because I believe in two genders count them one two and I believe in a big beautiful wall with a large well guarded gate and I believe in sustaining traditions that don't hurt anyone and I really find it hard to believe that naming a homecoming king and queen is hurting anybody but what do I know I'm just a closed-minded privileged white girl who oh yeah happen to be homecoming queen thanks for watching everybody I'm Amanda headboard the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.osr.wa.gov.au/payrollenquiry
