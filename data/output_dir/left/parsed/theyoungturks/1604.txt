RAPPER T.I.
HAS BEEN ARRESTED
IN ATLANTA WHERE AT LEAST IT
COUNTRY CLUB COMMUNITY
THAT HE LIVES IN.
THIS WAS IN HENRY COUNTY
TO BE EXACT.
POLICE NOT ONLY ARRESTED HIM, HE
WAS CHARGED WITH A NUMBER OF
MISDEMEANORS INCLUDING
DISORDERLY CONDUCT, AND SIMPLE
ASSAULT.
WHAT DID YOU DO EXACTLY?
IT
TURNS OUT HE ATTEMPTED TO
REENTER THE GATED COMMUNITY HE
LIVES IN WHILE HE WAS DRUNK.
HE APPARENTLY DID NOT HAVE A KEY
TO GET BACK INTO THE GATES AND
HE TRIED COMMUNICATING WITH A
SECURITY GUARD WHO WAS THERE.
HIS LAWYER SAYS THE SECURITY
GUARD WAS ASLEEP AND IT WAS HARD
TO GET HIM TO WAKE UP BUT A
VERBAL ALTERCATION ENSUED.
WE DON'T HAVE VERY MANY DETAILS
AS TO WHAT WAS SAID BUT
NONETHELESS LET ME GIVE YOU THE
DETAILS THAT WE HAVE AT THIS
MOMENT.
AT SOME POINT THEY ACTUALLY
CALLED T.I.'S WIFE'S TO CONFIRM
THAT HE DOES IN FACT LIVE IN
THIS GATED COMMUNITY AND SHE DID
CONFIRM IT AND SAID LET HIM AND
IMMEDIATELY AT THE GUARD
REFUSED TO DO SO.
POLICE WERE CALLED AND HE
WAS ARRESTED.
>> I READ THE HEADLINE AND
THOUGHT THIS DEPENDS AND I
WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT
DEPENDS ON.
IF YOU ARE GOING INTO YOUR OWN
GATED COMMUNITY, IT DEPENDS
NUMBER ONE, IF YOU HAVE A KEY ñ
IF THE GUARD DOESN'T LET YOU
WHEN IT IS TOTALLY WRONG AND
IT IS OUTRAGEOUS.
IN THIS CASE HE DIDN'T
HAVE A KEY.
NOW WANT TO POINT NUMBER TWO,
CAN HE CALL SOMEONE INSIDE THE
HOUSE TO LET HIM IN?
IF HE
DOESN'T THEN THERE IS NO ONE TO
VOUCH THAT HE IS ACTUALLY T.I.
AND
LIVES THERE.
WELL THEN THE GUARD IS RIGHT.
IT IS HIS JOB TO NOT LET HIM
UNLESS HE HAS EVIDENCE OF THAT.
BUT IN THIS CASE HE DID CALL THE
HOUSE AND THE HOUSE SAID THAT
IS MY HUSBAND, LET HIM IN.
SO WHY WOULD YOU NOT LET HIM IN?
IT MIGHT BE THAT THE WHOLE
DISCUSSION ABOUT WAKING UP THE
GUARD MIGHT BE A REFERENCE TO
THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF THAT IT
CAUGHT FEELINGS ON BOTH SIDES?
>>I DON'T KNOW.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF RACE PLAYS A
ROLE, I DON'T KNOW THE RACE OF
THE SECURITY GUARD BUT IT IS
HARD NOT TO THINK THAT IT DOES.
THAT IF THERE IS A GATED
COMMUNITY WHERE A WHITE PERSON
COMES AND SAYS CALL MY WIFE NO
MATTER HOW DRUNK THE PERSON IS ñ
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE
DONE THAT?
IF THE GUARD DOESN'T
LET HIM IN ñ THAT IS NOT TO BE A
MINUSCULE PERCENTAGE OF THE
INSTANCES.
>> FOR ME THINGS STARTED TO TAKE
AN EXTREMELY NEGATIVE TERM
WHEN THEY CALLED HIS WIFE AND
SHE CONFIRMED THAT HE LIVED
THERE AND THEY STILL WOULDN'T
LET HIM IN.
AT THAT POINT THEY LOST ME.
YOU'RE RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE
EVIDENCE OF WHAT WAS SAID OR HOW
THIS PLAYED A ROLE.
THE SIMPLE ASSAULT MISDEMEANOR?
WHY?
BUT I WILL SAY THIS, AT THE
POINT WHERE IT HAS BEEN
CONFIRMED THAT I LIVE IN THIS
COMMUNITY AND YOU ARE DENYING ME
ENTRY TO MY OWN PROPERTY THAT IS
WHEN I GET EXTREMELY ANGRY AND
UPSET.
YOU ARE RIGHT IN SAYING WE DON'T
KNOW IF RACE PLAYS A ROLE BUT
HERE IS WHAT I DO KNOW, I DO
KNOW THAT LIVING IN ANY
SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TO DEAL
WITH GATEKEEPERS, A HOMEOWNERS
ASSOCIATION OR ANY TYPE OF GATED
COMMUNITY, IT IS THE WORST
SITUATION, DO NOT GET YOURSELF
INVOLVED BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE UP
YOUR BUTT CONSTANTLY.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR RACE
IS THAT THE PEOPLE LIVING IN
THE SAME AREA QUESTION EVERYONE
AND HARASS EVERYONE.
THEY ARE INCREDIBLY
OVERWHELMINGLY UNBEARABLE.
I KNOW IT SEEMS GREAT TO LIVE IN
A GATED COMMUNITY OR H AWAY
SITUATION, JUST DON'T BECAUSE
THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO DEAL WITH REGULARLY.
>> IF YOU ARE T.I. AND YOU HAVE
SEEN THE NEWS LATELY WHERE A
WOMAN GOING TO GAIL'S QUESTION
FOR SLEEPING IN THE DORM THAT
SHE IS IN AT YALE.
THERE ARE GUYS GETTING KICKED
OUT OF THE STARBUCKS, THEY ARE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN ñ THE LIST GOES
ON AND ON.
SO NOW HE LIVES THERE AND HE HAS
MADE A LOT OF MONEY AND HE HAS A
REALLY NICE HOUSE IN THE CALL
HIS WIFE AND SHE CONFIRMS THAT
HE LIVES THERE AND THE GUARD
STILL SAYS NO, I THINK HE GETS
TO BE SUPER FRUSTRATED AND ALSO
GETS TO WONDER IF IT MIGHT BE
ABOUT RACE.
>>BY THE WAY LET ME BE CLEAR OF
COURSE THAT IS A POTENTIAL
FACTOR AND OF COURSE HE GETS
TO WONDER ABOUT IT.
I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I
AM NOT TRYING TO BLAME HIM FOR
BEING IN A GATED COMMUNITY.
I'M JUST SAYING PROPERTY OWNERS
OR PEOPLE IN ANY GIVEN
NEIGHBORHOOD GET INSANE WHEN IT
COMES TO KEEPING THE
NEIGHBORHOOD SAFE OR WHATEVER.
IT GETS WORSE WHEN YOU ARE IN A
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION TYPE
ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE HAVE
THE JUSTIFICATION TO CONSTANTLY
HARASS YOU.
>> LASTLY AND MAY BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT ñ PEOPLE CAUGHT
FEELINGS.
THE COPS, WHEN YOU SHOW UP YOU
ARE SUPPOSED TO SAY HEY DOES HE
BELONG HERE OR NOT?
DID YOU CALL THE HOUSE?
YES.
TO THE HOUSE SAY TO LET HIM IN?
YES.
THEN WE ARE DONE WITH IT.
BUT INSTEAD YOU DEFY ANY KIND OF
AUTHORITY EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE
TOTALLY LOGICALLY CORRECT.
AND INSTEAD BECAUSE YOU DEFIED A
SECURITY GUARD WE ARE GOING TO
ARREST YOU AND DO THIS LAUNDRY
LIST OF CHARGES.
IF T.I.
WAS UPSET AND HE WAS
YELLING I GUARANTEE YOU THE COPS
WERE LIKE HOW DARE YOU.
BUT THINK ABOUT WHY IS HE UPSET?
IS THERE A CHANCE THAT HE IS
RIGHT?
DID THAT EVER OCCUR TO YOU?
>>I WANT TO CONTINUE THIS
CONVERSATION IN OUR MEMBERS ONLY
POST GAME TODAY BECAUSE I HAVE A
LOT TO SAY ñ WE TALK ABOUT
PRIVILEGE A LOT AND JUST THIS
PAST WEEKEND I WAS IN A
SITUATION WHERE I LITERALLY
YELLED AT SOMEONE IN THE
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION.
NO ONE CALLS THE COPS.
I WILL GIVE YOU THE DETAILS
BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN DAY THE WAY
PEOPLE GET TREATED.
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO
DIFFERENTIATE.
