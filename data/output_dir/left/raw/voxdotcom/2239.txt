1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,840
After Pokemon Go was released in the US, it
took less than a day before it was making

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,660
more money than all the other apps in both
Apple’s and Google’s app stores.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:14,009
“It’s already earned $14 million in revenue
since launching last Wednesday — not even

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,510
a full week.”
But users didn’t have to pay a cent for

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,699
the game. All that money was coming from optional
purchases people were making as they played.

6
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:26,820
This is the world of Freemium apps — a business
model that, in the past few years, has largely

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,780
wiped out the market for paid games.
Now game designers have to monetize the gameplay

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,180
and one way to do that is by applying some
fundamental lessons of behavioral psychology.

9
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,960
The first thing these games do is set up a
virtual currency so that it doesn’t feel

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,489
like you’re spending real currency, even
though you are.

11
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:52,920
This is a variation on something we’ve known
for decades - which is that people find it

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,670
harder to spend money when they’re paying
in cash than if they’re using a card.

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,320
“So when you pay cash for something, you
see it leave your hands and you get a very immediate

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,680
sense of how much your cash reserves have
dropped, how much your wealth has dropped.”

15
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,909
Games add yet another layer. You pay for lollipop
boosters with gold bars and you pay for gold

16
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:18,420
bars with your credit card, which is already
distanced from actual payment.

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,280
And then on top of that, they don’t make
the exchange rate simple. It’s not 50 gems

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,479
for 50 cents.
“They’re always something weird like 1

19
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:32,130
dollar will get you 12 purple diamonds, and
that sort of off kilter exchange rate is the

20
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,320
same thing you see with people spending — tourists
spending money that they’re not familiar

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,829
with in foreign countries.”
If incense costs 80 pokecoins and a batch

22
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:51,219
of 550 pokecoins costs $4.99, how much real
money does incense cost? Yeah i don’t know

23
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,189
either.
So you’re spending money that doesn’t

24
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,180
seem real and it only takes a second because
the app store already has your credit card.

25
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,200
The whole payment process is designed to be
painless.

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,840
Other parts of the game, however, are designed
to be painful.

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,469
A key finding of behavioral research is that
people tend to experience unexpected losses

28
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:13,110
more intensely than comparable gains. That
can inform the timing of purchase prompts.

29
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,170
In Puzzle & Dragons, players progress through
a dungeon before facing a boss, and if they

30
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,980
die, they stand to lose all the rewards they
just earned. That’s when they’re presented

31
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,080
with the option to save their coins and their
points by spending magic stones, which you

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,800
can by in the store with real money.
Other developers actively embed inconvenience

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,260
into the games, so that you can purchase convenience.
In Clash of Clans and Game of War, everything

34
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,420
you try to build has wait times that get progressively
longer but are skippable, for a price.

35
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,820
“So they build incentives to remove pain
points into the games and then if they want

36
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,500
that, then they have the incentives to insert
pain points into the game.”

37
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,150
Ultimately though, only a tiny percentage
of players actually become payers. And a small

38
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,980
percentage of payers are those so-called “whales”
— people who will pay hundreds, sometimes

39
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,110
thousands of dollars in the app.
The marketing firm Swrve estimates that about

40
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,700
half of the revenue for mobile games is coming
from less than a half of a percent of all

41
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,900
players.
Which means that for some of these games,

42
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,870
non-paying users, which is most people, are
essentially pouring time into a game designed

43
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,030
to hit the pain points of a small, susceptible
group of players. If you’re really having

44
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,090
fun, that’s fine.
But it might be worth rewarding games that

45
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,790
find another way. As of now, the monetization
in Pokemon Go is unobtrusive, it’s kind

46
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:41,470
of tucked away. And that lack of manipulation
is a pretty good reason to buy some lure modules

47
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,610
and some incense.

48
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,690
One argument in favor of free-to-play games
and in-app purchases is that they give developers

49
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,890
a reason to keep updating the games. And they’re
collecting tons of data in order to inform

50
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,630
those updates — things like where you get
stuck, where you close the game, which features

51
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,840
are most popular. All that data can help them
keep making a game that you want to keep playing.

52
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,920
But it also means that they can tweak the
prices based on individual profiles and behavior.

53
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,860
If it seems like you’re about to quit, hey
here’s a discount. Or if you’re the type

54
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,260
of person who will spend a lot of money, maybe
they bump up the prices a bit. They can even

55
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,510
look at how fancy your phone is and what country
you live in and set the prices accordingly.

56
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,070
According to one survey, 40% of game developers
said they were setting different prices for

57
00:04:29,070 --> 00:00:00,000
different players. But the survey was anonymous
and it’s pretty hard to tell which games those are.
