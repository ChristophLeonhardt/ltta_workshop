I'm Ezra Levant it's June 12th and you're watching battleground well hello and welcome every day at 12 noon Eastern Time 5 p.m. in the UK 9 a.m. on the west coast we have a live chat for one hour as you can see on the right hand side of the screen your comments scroll up by the hundred if you want to have a super chat comment you can chip in a few bucks and it's pin there and it put in bright colors and the great news is it's one of the few things that Google actually pays us as a content creator we get the dough we I just have to say I'm blown away by what's happened in the last 24 hours in Korea rather in Singapore about Korea the proof of the pudding is in the tasting as our British friends say but it's a pretty persuasive I'm going to refer to the actual text of the document and I want to show that and read through it in a minute but that's the dry lawyerly output the real work is trying to get Kim jong-un a reclusive Hermit son of a hermit son of a hermit so he's the third generation in this family dictatorship tyranny this dynasty how to get him to do a deal with Donald Trump the master of the art of the deal and I want to show you a short prepared video that the White House put out very short there's actually no words on it it's just imagery and I'm going to show you this video and I'm gonna tell you the criticism of it this is the fancy video that's called and then I'm gonna show you a very unusual video styled as a movie the Donald Trump played for Kim jong-un in Singapore a movie made just for him I have to say it's the most interesting movie I think I've seen why I can't even remember when it's the most interesting propaganda directed at one person though on you know on Facebook you can really target ads I don't know if you know that I'm it's we're a little bit in the media business here so you can target an ad on Facebook to men or women people of a certain age people who live in a certain place people who like a certain rock band people who work somewhere you can really specify it and that's why you get such unique and personalized ads on the internet it's wonderful imagine making a whole movie or about a four or five minute movie just for one person I will show you that video in its entirety a little bit first I want to say hello to Kairos Papa ghosts who chipped in five bucks thank you first time in a live show love your work I don't agree with everything you say but that's a good thing that's right we have friendly discussions why isn't that the truth Congress thank you very much for saying that we've been having this daily chat for over a month now I think it's pretty fun I do my best to read all of the super chats because if folks are kicking in a few bucks the least I can do is read theirs on Fridays by the way for those who don't know we call it free for all Fridays where I just read as many as many as many comments as possible obviously all the super check comments but I try and read the non super chat ones and I do like reading the critical questions or even mild insults I don't want to get into too much for Fanny and there's some profanity there but not too much the reason I like reading the critical questions is maybe there's an underlying issue there that we have to talk about so thanks for your friendly word friendly word Cyrus but without further to do let me play for you now a quick clip put out by the White House about Donald Trump and Kim jong-un walking side-by-side in Singapore very simple isn't it no words grandiose music and what's so notable about this is the parity the Equality the Equality in the number of North Korean flags and American flags the two men just the two of them side by side equals in every way there was only one tiny thing that showed Donald Trump was the big dog and that was when they shook hands Trump put his hand on on Kim jong-un's other arm as he is its trump move but other than that one tiny flicker the entire thing was equality between the two men and I won't play you a lot of clips about it now I'm going to show some of them on my 8:00 p.m. show tonight but the me know how dared Trump legitimize Kim jong-un how dare he gives such prestige look at this enormous victory he's given to Kim jong-un yeah my first reaction that is we've already given him plenty of victories Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright Secretary of State at the time gave a massive victory to Kim jong-un going to Pyongyang where Kim Jonathan put on a spectacular war show where one of the images was Rockets being watched so yeah we've already given him everything money oil permission to build nukes whatever this isn't about that this is about the psychology of getting Kim jong-un to do a deal and I'll you'll see that psychology in the second video I show you in a moment then lay the music in that piece was was majestic it had a historic feeling just the two men because if you're going to do a deal with Kim jong-un you have to psychologically emotionally plug into a very unique and strange man it has been noted that Kim jong-un has probably never been in a real negotiation in his life now I don't think that's quite true because of course he would be given in structions and he has had meetings with President Xi of China and North Korea is really a client state of China so he would have been given marching orders by China I wouldn't say it was definitely a negotiation Kim jong-un would never have negotiated to buy a car to buy a house negotiated any business deal he is the authoritarian autocrat where his word is law even a sort of divine law in North Korea has he ever negotiated with someone before well no I think is the answer I mean others in the Korean North Korean government have parleyed with the West but I I would say that it was all bad faith trickery on the part of North Korea and that's why people are skeptical now obviously but if you want to get someone to move beyond gaming your negotiations using it as trickery taking all the concessions the West will give but not actually giving anything and that you know perpetual brinksmanship take what you can get then do some bad boy bad cop activities get some more compromises and concessions be a good boy for a bit and then be a bad boy again and shoot some missiles and do some new tests and then get some kid like that that's the game that Kim jong-un has played bad faith negotiating that was just playing off the fools in the West particularly John Kerry and Barack Obama but if you actually want Kim jong-un to actually do a deal you got to push the right buttons in them and Donald Trump I think is really the only president I can think of who could do that and this way is probably the only way to do it as Shimon Perez used to say about Israel negotiating with terrorists he said well yeah that's how peace negotiations are done you do them with your enemies not your friends so the idea that you're normalizing or legitimizing your enemy well that is one of the byproducts of trying to make peace with them especially if they live in the land of symbology and iconography and where they believe they are a god son child prophet Messiah was over the top was it too luxurious I mean Donald Trump would never have such a diffusive display for somebody like Justin Trudeau of course not but he's trying to game Kim jong-un that is a very lengthy introduction to a very short video but I oh I just see that there's another super Chad here kapa Dessau says Trump's an asshole and that's a great blessing well there's something to that if you're looking for a boyfriend if you're looking for a babysitter if you're looking for someone to you know do you a kind favor a personal favor yet don't don't don't choose Trump but if you're looking for a guy to be the toughest hombre around and take on tough problems that are intransigent problems that have been lingering for decades this North Korean problem is 68 years old since the start of the Korean War that war is still ongoing by the way it's just in a ceasefire there's no formal peace treaty addendum you probably need a bad hombre and Barack Obama really never negotiated anything in his life and it showed the deals he gave away to Iran the deals he gave away the North Korea he did literally nothing as Putin just devoured the Crimea from Ukraine uh george w bush was not much better the way he let Putin Devourer Georgia so my point is I think you need a tough son of a gun if you're gonna try and do the biggest deal in history modern history at least now let me show you the most fascinating video I have seen since I can recall I've seen propaganda videos I've seen modern political videos I've watched Leni Riefenstahl propaganda for Hitler really some of the first effective use of the sin of cinematography for a propaganda the Nazi imagery very much designed to persuade this is on par with that in terms of its power I want to show you the entire video and then we're gonna go through it and we're gonna break break break I want Scott Adams review of it and I'm impressed with his take on it I have a couple of things to add believe it or not I to Scott Adams in his discussion of persuasive and this all the time of course he's the master of it but there are a couple of things about North Korea that come to mind and about Kim jong-un that Scott Adams just didn't have time to get to I'm sure here's the thing this video you're about to see has been panned by the fancy people they're laughing at it all the failed Filton school grads who thought they'd be a big deal in Hollywood are now writing blogs for Huffington Post or whatever they laugh at this I see someone said oh this is like something you'd see on The Apprentice it's so sloppy yeah who's this movie for this movie was played just for Kim jong-un this was a movie made for one person so what's that one person like well probably not like some millennial luxurious liberal in Brooklyn hipster having avvocato toast talking about trans this and Islamophobia that it's probably going to be someone who's deeply paranoid but also narcissistic who has been told that he is a God but knows he's a man but still likes to think of himself as a god and a historic player who enjoys getting the world to dance like think of this psychology think of the history think about Kim jong-un's fascination with fine things and his tastes are are are interesting his film he's obsessed with his father was obsessed with film 20,000 films he had in the library his father kidnapped a leading film director in South Korea kidnapped because it was just obsessed with films they would make films he sees the West in the world through Sylvester Stallone of course he had a strange friendship with I just forgot his name the best composer the end behavior start Oh Charles run that's very that's very broad Rodman so the NBA makes it appear so you got Sly Stallone he makes an appearance you got Rodman the NBA makes an appearance you got fancy things that he likes you're gonna see a speedboat you're gonna see heavy industry of the Stalinist variety that's so important to North Korea in a weird sort of fifties idea about what the future is like monorails and you're gonna laugh because you're a savvy westerner like me postmodern you say monorails we make fun of monorails in the Simpsons yeah not in North Korea that's sort of you you got a monorail so without further throat-clearing let me now play for you in full oh I want to say one last thing this video clip it's got the White House branding on it but it starts out with a pretend film company like metro-goldwyn-mayer or 20th Century Fox I think it's called destiny Dennis Rodman survivor st. Charles Robin this film starts out like pretending to be a movie it like it's made-up film company name to it let's watch seven billion people inhabit planet Earth of those alive today only a small number will leave a lasting impact and only the very few will make decisions or take actions that renew their homeland and change the course of history history may appear to repeat itself for generations cycles that never seemed to end there have been times of relative peace and times of great tension while this cycle repeats the light of prosperity and innovation has burned bright for most of the world history is always evolving and there comes a time when only a few are called upon to make a difference but the question is what difference will a few make the past doesn't have to be the future out of the darkness can come the light and the light of hope can right what if of people that share a common and rich heritage can find a common future their story is well known but what will be their sequel Destinee pictures presents a story of opportunity a news story a new beginning one of peace two men two leaders one destiny a story about a special moment in time when a man is presented with one chance that may never be repeated what release use to show vision and leadership or not there can only be two results one of moving back or one of moving forward a new world can begin to Dave one of friendship respect and goodwill be part of that world where the doors of opportunity are ready to be opened investment from around the world where you can have medical breakthroughs and abundance of resources innovative technology and new discoveries what if can history be changed will the world embrace this change and when could this moment in history begin it comes down to a choice on this day in this time at this moment the world will be watching listening anticipating will this leader choose to advance his country and be part of a new world be the hero of his people will he shake the hand of peace and enjoy prosperity like he has never seen a great life or more isolation which path will be chosen featuring President Donald Trump and chairman kim jeong-hoon in a meeting to remake history to shine in the stunt one moment one choice what if the future remains to be written I have to say that's an amazing amazing piece of work it gives me the chills and I like to think I'm sort of normal immersed in the modern culture postmodern culture media culture but I can't help but notice the quirks of that I mentioned NBA because the Dennis Rodman I mentioned Sly Stallone these are the things we know Kim jong-un knows about cares about is obsessed with his images of the West I thought it was interesting that certain things that we in the postmodern world think of is maybe not that appealing like high voltage power transmission lines that was the future and we sort of laugh because we find those unsightly but of course they don't have electricity in much of North Korea we'll watch the movie again they'll stop it in a few parts but you'll recall there was a part where the famous image of the Korean Peninsula from space at night and the South is ablaze with light especially Seoul Korea and the North is dark the tiny little dot in Pyongyang and the future is boom on come the lights in the North very exciting power hydroelectric dams we hate dams for granted I mean they're sort of cool I mean Hoover Dam is sort of cool I once visited two I visited a few dams there pretty cool guys think they're cool I think maybe some gals too if you don't have any dams you want one and that's sort of the Stalinist heavy industry drones you know so it's I I think the cynical I'm adjusting so many criticism through this film out there as if this was made for someone in Brooklyn who say well where's the trans character and you know you know when it's you know it's not about you and it's and one of the reasons I showed the first Trump White House video that was majestic and done 90% for the general population was to show Donald Trump knows how to make a movie if he wants to the guy was in the heart of showbiz for a decade between the apprentice and his other shows including Miss America the guy's a master of showbiz he he knows things about the media that they've sort of forgotten about themselves about their psychology and how they work destiny pictures all that's over-the-top says you and mean you don't think Kim jong-un thinks about his destiny all the time you don't think the royal family in the United Kingdom thinks about their destiny what it means and what's their purpose of course they do but they are are subject to a constitution and they are no longer considered to have Divine Right all the self-doubts that we know about that the royal family has what's our purpose why am i doing it imagine those four godlike autocrat like Kim jong-un son of a dictator grandson of a dictator imagine the weight of history history doesn't have to repeat itself great civilizations you got it I mean you and I am in Canada you're watching in Canada United States United Kingdom and they showed the Colosseum in Rome they showed Westminster Parliament buildings in London they showed these amazing civilizations and North Korea you and I would sort of chuckle that North Korea would be put on par with these mighty historic civilizations the Roman Empire ya know but you don't think this was built based on a heavy duty deep forensic analysis of everything the CIA has ever learned about this guy everything everything that any visitor has come back and every you know in a hacked message everything that they knew about him was put into this history doesn't have to repeat itself surely he's surely the echoes of his future of his past generations had the same thoughts there was another thing I want to comment on and we'll play through again where was the the leader of South Korea he was there you'll remember when Kim Jonathan stepped across the symbolic border of Panama John wasn't Donald Trump who greeted me was the leaders for South Korea he was there but not his face was not shown he was dark when Kim was light this was about two great men the leader of the free world Donald Trump and Kim on equal standing because Kim jong-un obviously has no respect or fear for his southern counterpart he probably believes that all of Korea should be his that's why the Korean War began so it's interesting to me the parity of the two men and again that was the criticism of the left or not even the left the the never Trump errs had I want to show you when Barack Obama we have the picture of a Barack Obama meeting with Raul Castro in Cuba this picture makes me laugh so hard because Obama deliberately made his wrist limp because he didn't want to be seen to be doing some communist fists in the air kind of thing which like he was clearly uncomfortable by Raul Castro picking up his arm like that to do some sort of socially Samoan worth day so he made his wrists limp on purpose which looks just so awful but I think it would have been more awful if he would have had a fist up would you agree with me I just just to indulge myself can I show you one more little clip of Obama Justin Trudeau and the Mexican we just need a second to get it it's a three-way handshake by the way don't try and do a three-way handshake it doesn't really work because your right hand shakes with someone else's right hand so if there's a third person you got to have a left hand thing going on and it doesn't doesn't really work let me know when we have that there we go yeah yeah you got yeah yeah that's the theory anyways I'm just having some handshake fun there but you see do you see why it might be important for Donald Trump to elevate Kim jong-un who we all know is a murderer a mass murderer a destroyer of civil rights someone who is enslaved his own population has caused a man-made famine who's a torturer who's a war criminal do you see how it might be important if you actually want a real deal with such a man then you have to enter into his psychological world you see how that might be something important to do if you actually want to deal if you just want to be a plaything for them like Madeleine Albright bill clinton george w bush barack obama john kerry hillary clinton where if you just want to toy with him for press releases yeah do whatever but if you actually want to deal so we're gonna let me teach 1226 i want to read a few comments and then we're going to go through the video and and i'm gonna pause it a few things because there's a few other images i want to talk about Mikey one ten thousand Kim's got less morals in a halal butcher well Kim is an evil man that's for sure but he's also if you can try to put yourself in his position son of a tyrant son of a tyrant and his perception of the world is so skewed there are all these legends about his grandfather and his father and about him that they have mystical powers that they're the most powerful people in the world that they have scientific powers that they have supernatural powers that they came there when they were born there was a miracle there was the Sun rose twice or something I don't know the exact myths but there's all these supernatural myths around them that they are godlike and if you grow up and your grandpa was a god and your dad was a god it's said that you're a god you're not just dealing with royalty like the British family you're dealing with a cult royalty that believes it has divine power or at least says so and do you believe it yourself that's that tough guy to negotiate with don't you think let me read some more comments Miss USA not Miss America says Jonathan Bryant thank you for the correction I'm just going off the cuff here on these noon hours shows so I gotta get things wrong I call him Charles Rodman instead of Dennis Rodman I'm serene Jon's Elam Victoria says john zealand with any luck but don't hold your breath Steve G for it to be given a chance my Kim needs to be given a clean slate that will that happen well you'll notice many times in that film the narrative was the past doesn't have to predict the future you can change the past you can get out of those old cycles let me help you get into the future a hand of peace isn't that interesting cop adesso says Ezra Levant could compete in Miss America considering the recent rule changes you're right because the in the past only the swimsuit competition was what kept me out because there are several court orders forbidding me from going outside and showing anyone my man yeah I'm sorry I'm making a joke there but of course I wouldn't be hideous but of course they took the beauty out of the beauty pageant so I'm a real contender now I was going to make a joke about Arrested Development and and then never nude in there I'll say that joke for later I'm gonna read a couple more comments and then we're gonna watch the film one more time Petra rush B says learn something great name Steve G said Mark Jones don't take offense to what I'm sayin just my opinion and ruber sack autos families soon North Korea you referring to otto warmbier an american who was kidnapped by North Korea and tortured and murdered by them and indeed he was not the first or the only one what's interesting to me is and and I should have mentioned this Donald Trump called off this negotiation you recall a couple weeks ago cuz Kim made some disparaging comments about America and Trump just tweeted a letter that he sent to came as very polite he says I'm sorry you feel that way we can't have this discussion if you're not submitting to this process I'm if you want me to come back I will but until then until you correct things I'm out of here and that was that landed like a thud because for his whole life Kim jong-un is used to toying with negotiators in the West who wanted to deal more than he did and here you had Donald Trump just cancelling this great summit the tump at Trump had built up so much Trump sit up you're giving me lip I'm out he in that same letter he said thank you by the way for releasing the prisoners I appreciate that but if you're not going to submit to our process I'm out you can call me if you change your mind so Trump literally walked away stunned Kim we know that because of how Kim's officials reacted and we also know that because Kim said come back come back come back please come back and sent high-level advisors to meet directly with Trump at the White House so step one Trump showed he was willing to walk away something Obama George W Bush and Bill Clinton never did step two Trump got concessions in advance he got the release of these prisoners and he basically got a commitment to a denuclearization of the peninsula before this summit even happened didn't he oh I saw another super chat let me read it Lisa Leto says there is a rumor that Kim's great-grandparents were Christian it's very interesting I have not heard that rumor it's possible there are a lot of Koreans who are Christian so that may be the case I don't know I think that whatever Christianity was in that family has long since been purged I think that they are their own gods and they act that way and that's one of the reasons why Trump has to approach him so I mean if you were negotiating with a David Koresh or with you know I'm not gonna say Scientology because I think they sort of know that's a gig but if you were dealing with a rasputin someone who actually thought they were if he were dealing with Nostradamus or something someone who thought they had supernatural religious powers you would talk to them differently than you would negotiate at a g7 conference let's play the Donald Trump persuasion video one more time and I'm gonna halt it at a few moments and add a few comments as we go and and it's 12:30 to some cognizant at the time so let's play that one more time and I'll probably stop at about four times here we go okay so stop right there what's that link I don't know but do you doubt that Lake keep with the picture the lake up just for one second do you doubt that that Lake has a deep symbolic meaning is that I mean I could research it is that a lake where this has historical resonance is that a lake where he supposedly was born where his grandfather was born I don't know but don't you doubt for one second that this has a deep meaning to him and I just love that destiny pictures bin just love it keep going seven billion people in that Sun that Sun you'll see that above three times is that just wow this is big again can we put the yeah I'll come back in a second there there are many legends and myths about Kim and his father and grandfather and some of them involve solar events do you doubt that has you doubt that has a symbolic meaning why is that there again I some of the mythology around Kim's family before carrying on the show today and I'm not in a position to say I have the definitive explanation but to look at this as just some film out of Hollywood he's wrong this film was surely crafted at Langley okay keep going seven billion people inhabit planet Earth of those alive today only a small number will leave a lasting impact did you see that I'm reminded the hat they had the Acropolis the Greek Empire they had the pyramids from the mighty Egyptian pharaohs does anyone in the in the world actually think North Korea will endure thousands of years from now is this mighty empire no and maybe Kim Jong undersand either but that's his whole life's narrative we are a mighty place that can stand up to Donald Trump in America and Obama and again this movie was made to convince one person and that person ain't you and me keep going and only the very few will make decisions or take actions that would move their homeland and change the course of history history may appear to repeat itself for generations cycles that never seem to end there have been times of relative peace and times of great tension while this cycle repeats the light of prosperity and innovation has burned bright for most of the world did you see those goggles that guy was wearing like it feels like a 1960s vision of the future in the future we will have vana rails in the future we hope what's that guy doing what is that guy doing I don't know maybe that's a maybe that's some gaming I don't know is that that is the that 3d immersion virtual reality gaming maybe maybe that's actually cooler than I think but that I think - maybe I'm showing that I'm on its side but I think I mean monorail and you you know I just I think this is what Kim jong-un thinks the future is oculus rift and stuff like that can you go Shan has burned bright for most of the world history is always evolving and there comes a time when only a few called upon to make the difference but the question is what difference will the few make the past doesn't have to be at the future out of the darkness can come the light and the light of hope can burn bright what if of people that share a common and rich heritage that can find a common future their story is well known but what will be their sequel look at that did you see that spotlight on Kim jong-un and not that who's that that other guy well that's the thing it this is about elevating Kim jong-un as an equal to Trump do you think he's an equal to Trump no does Trump think he's in equal to Trump no are you and I the target market of this know the god Emperor hermit king divine second Sun in the sky is the target here they literally are blacking out the South Korean leader to show how important to show how important Kim is what do you think so far they keep going destiny pictures presents a story of opportunity a news story a new beginning one of peace two men two leaders one destiny a story about a special moment in time when a man is presented with one chance that may never be repeated what release use to show vision and leadership or not you know how many times have they shown that son I mean are they up to ten already I I am now very curious about what the the symbology of that is that there's not a single frame in this movie is accidental I mean it's it's it's a fascinating fascinating thing and and even when they say or we can have this amazing future or things are going to go bad again and did you see how it was burning through an old piece of film like people today don't even remember that he used to film used to be an actual film and it was on reels and it would go over a bright light that was really hot and if it stopped the heat of the light would burn the film I don't think anyone in the Western world has even seen as young as Kim jong-un has even seen a reel-to-reel film like that like at the oldest if here's 35 or something you've seen a VHS or a DVD but remember Kim jong-un's dad had 20,000 films a reel-to-reel film that was loaded up on a hot projector light so that's that even that symbol there that was targeted at a guy who probably thought oh you wrecked my favorite movie and that dream that I had about watching that fantasy is now wrecked like don't you think that that that's a likely meaning of that that any I'll keep going there can only be two results one of moving back or one of moving forward you wasn't that great go back to that lights on that's that that shot from space that I was referring to that's the fake one can you scroll back just five more yeah that's the real satellite image South Korea's lit up with light that big big bright spot in the northwest that's Seoul Korea one of the mightiest cities in the world unfortunately so close to the North Korean border it's literally within range of artillery shells that's what's so scary to the South that's why no president before has risk going to war because even if North Korea didn't have nukes its conventional artillery could theoretically kill a million people in Seoul South Korea but but the draft I mean that you've got a tiny little spot alight in Pyongyang now roll forward this is the dream this is yeah boom and and it is quite a dream and you know what I think that could come true don't you agree with me that South Korea and for that matter Japan would probably put a trillion dollars into North Korea if I if a real peace we're done don't you think they would of course they would not just out of solidarity and an insurance policy against a rogue nuclear state been out of brotherly friendship and also capitalist opportunity I mean if the North become as productive as the south then you're looking at the greatest opportunity since the Germany's United after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the thing is Gorbachev and the Berlin Wall fell because they were being nudged and toppled from the outside but Donald Trump is trying to go in and make the pan moon John Wall come down that's a lot harder that would be like sending Ronald Reagan in to meet Gorbachev in 1988 let's say and try and make him move to peace that's how audacious Trump's visit is okay keep keep rolling a new world can begin today one of friendship respect and goodwill what were those horses you know what I if I have the time and ability I would try and find out what are those horses from theirs have been a few fantasy scenes in this movie having horses running they're just plain horses but they almost have a mystical magical feeling and a lot of those sky cloud heaven things is this some allegory is this some reference to his favorite film as a child I don't know but I can't believe they would choose that fantasy horse clip by accident just like the NBA was not by accident Dennis Rodman Sly Stallone not by accident there's a message there this is your dream it's a dream for your people it's a historic civilizational moment but maybe you can meet Sly Stallone maybe you can go to an NBA game okay keep rolling what a friendship respect and goodwill be part of that world where the doors of opportunity are ready to be open investment from around the world where you can have medical breakthroughs and abundance of resources innovative - hey guys you could have an MRI now we've had MRIs in the West for decades an abundance of resources yeah super market that the shelves aren't empty and and if you look at the cars on that assembly there that ain't a 2018 like that that looks like something that's a little more dated doesn't it but that's where Kim jong-un is I this is really targeted him okay keep rolling analogy and new discoveries what if can history be changed will the world embrace this change and when could this moment in history begin it comes down to a choice on this day in this time at this moment the world will be watching listen anticipating will this leader choose to advance his country and be part of a new room can you can you scroll back I think that was Times Square can you scroll back to that image of the huge TVs on that I don't think that's an actual shot I think that is a Photoshop I don't even think that's Times Square now that I look at it it's probably New York but that's not looking that's Times Square but you have two huge jumbo Tron's right one with Donald Trump and the other with kim jeong-hoon that's most definitely maybe that is Times Square from a different angle I don't think it is I don't think that charts ever happened I think this is a fantasy projection of here's what it could be like buddy you've always wanted to go to Times Square you've always wanted to go to New York imagine Donald Trump's on one side and you're on one side because anyone who's everyone gets to be on the jumbotron square again for you and me this might be cheesy but imagine you're a hermit king okay keep rolling Peter choose to advance his country and be part of a new world be the hero of his people will he shake the hand of peace and enjoy prosperity like he has never seen a great life prosperity like he's never seen first of all I love it's in that film it's in that cinematographic voice prosperity like he's never seen will he shake the hand of peace I didn't know that's what Donald Trump called him his mitts that will you will you shake the hand of peace well if you're dealing with the Hermit King you got to go grandiose and a speedboat like that he's probably I'm just guessing here I'm guessing he liked Miami Vice if you like your Americana if you like your fantasy movies I'm guessing he watched Miami Vice and I'm guessing he wants one of them speed boats I see a super challenge read it do you think other nations will feel that they can improve the lot of their people by acquiring nuclear weapons and threatened the US with them like Kim and then get the u.s. to buy a peace treaty the answer obviously is yes because there's both a carrot and a stick being implied here aren't there the stick is and he's not quite saying it but from showing the Air Force sorry that the naval battle group the aircraft carrier and yet was f-18 jet so there's a little bit of stick in this movie but I'd say it's about 90% carat well that's what happens when someone has a nuke and Trump has made it very clear and if you can find videos of Trump going back 15 20 years saying you got to deal with this before the guy has a nuke and I think that's why Trump is so vigorous on Iran stop Iran before they get a nuke Trump is trying to persuade Kim jong-un that's what this persuasion video is about this guy has a nuke he's got 20,000 pieces of artillery pointed at Seoul Korea we have to persuade him Trump would like to persuade Iran that's probably not doable so I think there's going to be a tougher option there because you can because Iran doesn't yet have the nuke or 20,000 pieces of artillery pointed at a city I see another super chat from penny Hutchison Thank You Ezra for all you do being a fan even before the Sun news well thanks very much penny I appreciate that you know we fight the fight we don't always get it right but we try our best and we try and have a little bit of fun doing it so thank you for reaching out to say hello we're almost done the movie I feel like mink and a peace deal with Donald Trump I didn't have those feelings before I watched this movie I've already got my electrification taken care of I've already got you know too much food as you can see they had sort of a 1990s era maternity ward with the babies and the incubators I guess that would be amazing for North Korea so I've got a lot of the things that Trump's already offering I've never been to an NBA game I could go in Toronto I guess if I wanted to slice alone was in Toronto recently I didn't choose to go and see him so but still Donald Trump makes those things look so amazing I want to do a peace deal with him and I'm not even kim jongmin let's watch the rest of the movie or more isolation which path will be chosen featuring President Donald Trump can we go back and look at the words on the screen just scroll back for one second I think it's sort of fun the faith that they put a quote on the screen again like a movie trailer I really think we have a very good chance of doing something very meaningful Donald Trump and then they quote Kim jong-un back to himself we no longer will have to tighten our belts that's quite a statement hey now I don't think that Kim jong-un has ever had to tighten his belt he's got a sort of a double chin there and I'm not wanting to talk but his people are so poor they they're boiling leather they're eating grass that's how poor and hungry they are I want to say one more thing that is the only time Kim Jong Un's name appears in this movie did you notice that they just talked about one man one leader they don't actually say you and they don't actually so they don't break the the was that the third what's the phrase break the third wall break the fourth wall you know when movies when they turn to the camera and look at you and talk to you the viewer it's a weird cinematic trick Ferris Bueller's Day Off was for famous for that you know the actors thought that and then they look at the camera said can you believe this guy and then they go back to it so they're not breaking the third wall or the fourth wall in this they're not talking to Kim jong-un they're talking about him and maybe destiny pictures presents maybe Kim jong-un says oh this is a film that's being released everyone's talking about it everyone's talking about me maybe it'll be reviewed and variety in Hollywood before and and Rotten Tomatoes everyone's talking to their film it's rigged so I want to be part of this moment I'm a movie star it's not written dear Kim jong-un let's persuade you it's hey world let us tell you this glorious historic like let us show you how history will be written two amazing people two equals two great leaders two great dynasties two great citizens of the world so you have the pyramids I think they showed Machu Picchu a couple times I think they might have shown the Arc de Triomphe we can't recall and Kim Jong un who's looking sexy I mean they tried to make him look good my point is I think if anything's got a chance of working this has a chance okay play the end in a meeting to remake history to shine in the Sun one moment one choice what if the future remains to be written all right there you go what do you think am I too enamored with this movie I think it is just so emotionally powerful in a medium that Kim jong-un's likes and it does speak truthfully I think if you make the right choice you will have electrification you will have maternity wards you will have food you will have speedboats you can come see an NBA game you will make history that's true don't you think he will make history if he choose to do this or if you don't well they didn't quite get quite said what would happen but the CF 80s or the f-18 jet made it fairly clear I found a persuasive and Donald Trump is getting flak from left to saying oh you're too kind to Kim I think you have to elevate someone who you want a concession from it I think I mentioned this about half an hour ago I think not only can Trump get this deal if it's to be God but I don't think any other leader could I don't think they understand persuasion I don't think they have the ice in their veins to negotiate hardball I don't think they have the toughness to walk away I don't think they have the bluntness to say things in a polite but firm way like make the right choice here it's once-in-a-lifetime in bed you know only once this is the moment now there was you know there was this was a sign on the dotted line today kind of message I see another super chair coming in same thing one could Justin be flattered out of office but it's similar propaganda film can we try a future where Justin is a drama teacher again my first instinct so as I was reading your question was no but my second upon 30 seconds reflection is yes my assessment of Donald Trump excuse me of Justin Trudeau is that he doesn't actually like the Prime Minister party being Prime Minister he likes to travel he likes the glamour he likes the selfies he likes hobnobbing he especially likes foreign travel he's made over 56 trips he likes the leisure time he took yesterday office' it's a personal day Donald Trump left the g7 flew 25 hours to Korea to Singapore had the most intense negotiations got on another flight 25 hours back through Guam he's 72 years old Justin Trudeau I think he's 46 if I'm not mistaken and he was so pooped from talking about being woke male feminist that he took Monday off he's excited off and Monday off because it was so exhausting I think to answer your question I think Justin Trudeau would love to be some sort of world mascot not the secretary-general of the United Nations because that would actually have work and he'd be you know if being New York a lot he loves New York but they have to work I think Justin Trudeau wants some sort of mascot type job like a UN ambassador for global warming or something where he can Swan around meet lots of fancy people vacation you know every couple weeks so yeah I think you could have a persuasion video for Justin Trudeau that would be imagine a future where no one says mean things about you where you don't have to listen to those gross conservatives in question period where everyone thinks you're wonderful I got yeah I actually think it'd be done alright so 57 we got a few minutes left let me read as many of your comments as possible I don't think I've missed any super chance um Tony naggy says China wants South Africa badly we'd better be careful well you're so right they bought up the rest of Africa China is an enormous investor in Africa and they'd let me look at Sudan when the Canadian company talisman was drilling there China became a partner in the Sudanese oil fields the largest weapons seller to China the largest buyer of China a weapons seller to Sudan the largest buyer of Sudanese well China just rivets itself to a country builds the local infrastructure extracts the resources sells the weapons it's just a all in one deal and they don't bring pesky human rights concerns like the West does China's totally taking over Africa by the way I see China active even in Central America as well hunky monkey over 130 countries love Trump we only hear about the g6 who hate Trump well who says the g6 hates Trump the leaders of the g6 might hate Trump but even that I'd take issue with I would put it to you that Shinzo Abe a the Prime Minister of Japan I'm not gonna say he likes Trump as a buddy but he's figured out that he's got to get along with Trump and I think he's figured out how to get along with from frankly I think the language barrier probably helps because it slows things down and and and people don't react immediately like I mean Trudeau is just a he's a short attention span these it's like a grown up millennial overgrown millennial Peter Pan so he reacts like a child Anglet Merkel clearly doesn't like Trump but I think she works with him the big news of the g7 is that she agreed to increase the amount of GDP spending on the military it's one of trumps long-standing demands I have no doubt that Canadians are probably like Californians in their political tastes and that if there was a secret ballot that most Canadians would be against Trump but to say I mean Italy's new prime minister is clearly a fan of Trump and the feeling's mutual I think that in the United Kingdom it's not as one side as people would say look at that country just voted for a brexit and you know I I wonder if you think I spent too much time on that persuasion video today I just thought it was amazing and it shows the kind of preparation that Donald Trump took to this North Korea visit kind of preparation then in our own country we just know that Justin Trudeau's never done for anything kind of preparation that makes you wonder why Donald Trump about kind of the g7 at all it was so unimportant by comparison and for my British friends I would say imagine of Teresa may put that kind of psychology and intelligence and planning and thought and strategy into negotiating a brexit I think the UK would be free by now and much richer that's Donald Trump at his best which is why everyone is freaking out I followed my friends have enjoyed our conversation today I'll be back tomorrow at 12:00 noon Eastern Time same time on be on tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern for my daily Ezra Levin show until next time on behalf of us here at rebel world core headquarters in Toronto good bye and keep fighting for freedom you
