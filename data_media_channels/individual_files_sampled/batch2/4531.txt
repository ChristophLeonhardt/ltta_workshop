back to that breaking news out of Toronto this video right here is from the ground it shows the scene after a van according to officials jumped a sidewalk there and hit a number of pedestrians this happened around 1:30 in the afternoon along a pretty thick wide stretch of highway Road streets there in Toronto six lane streets I believe the speed limit up there is 30 miles an hour witnesses on the scene say the van jumped the curb curb hit a fire hydrant knocked it off and then hit a number of people Toronto police say that first responders are on the scene they will not confirm the number of pedestrians struck or their injuries The Associated Press is reporting right now that it appears to be eight to ten pedestrians that were struck and if you were with us a little bit earlier we did see one image from the air that showed at least one person not looking like they were in very good shape but officially we do not have a confirmation on the extent of the injuries again this happened at 1:30 the driver of the van and the van itself the driver fled the scene drove away authorities were able to arrest the driver somewhat nearby we believe pretty quickly after this after this happened so far we don't have any idea what the motivation is we don't have any idea what the cause was here is one witness that was being interviewed right now she could see there I'm just with CTV News so we just want to ask you what did you see I saw there's a white truck just go to the side said mom had know so many people just shouting stop the car but he didn't just keep moving and he hated some people and three people lie down there and they didn't so the car just kept hitting people do you think it was on purpose or did it look like it was on purpose I think he's on purpose because he for the car doesn't work he should like hit the car or something so he can't stop but he just goes so the car started hitting here or was it up there where did you start hitting ok and this is Park home Avenue is that ready what is called here it's a park home and and young okay so you some starting hating people here and continue to go down on the sidewalk was he driving on the road he was driving on the side oh ok all right think I didn't get your name Emma Ron told me that the car drove from young feet yeah start hitting people and you know some people I've heard a call well gunshot Oh gunshot they heard a gunshot gunshot onto the Hat and they're all from there you're just keep hitting people that's my brother call tell me okay thank you guys hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
