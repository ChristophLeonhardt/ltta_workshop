oh where to begin what was your takeaway from maybe this book the Woodward book I've got to say even though we knew about it pretty up-close for a long time yeah and other people have been concerned about it and I think most of muscle Republicans on the hill who have ever dealt with him know all of this stuff that said Woodward writing a book about it makes it certainly makes everybody pay closer attention to it and pay more attention to it than say they would with the fire and fury books all right so what was your big anecdotes certainly ring true to the man we know and the man who never evolved or stepped up when he won the presidency so they're not surprising but it certainly certainly gives some flavor to it all I think the book also reveals there are some Patriots who are hanging in there trying very hard to keep this thing together and I guess we owe them a debt of gratitude you know I don't know what sometimes you really can't imagine what you would do if you're in that position in the position of secretary mattis or in the position of Gary Cohn taking papers away to try and prevent something from happening they're basically trying to handle someone who is unhinged and not well and not thinking in the best interest of our country really was there a part for you that stuck out well I think for me it was secretary mad at saying we're dealing with somebody with the intelligence of a fifth or a sixth grader talking about the president his understanding of the world but just to echo what mica said I don't think this is terribly surprising to a lot of us who talked to a lot of these people and it's what we hear in private now splashed into the pages of a book that there are people inside the White House in fact the people who were closest with President Trump who believe he is not capable of handling this job that they are just guardrails around the presidency of the United States of course the White House has come out and vehemently denied every word of this what a lob Woodward has talked to almost everyone who works inside the White House and you know also along that line a this has been going on for a long time I you know Nick and I had went to visit him in Trump Tower back in 2015 I think it was and everybody was shocked and offended that I had given him campaign advice and you know what my campaign advice was for him read yeah I was like do you I said do you and this was in white October of 2015 it was a little awkward but I go do you need do you ever read can you read and I wasn't being sarcastic and he just had people around him people around him who also said during the middle of that campaign that he had and I'm sorry we've got to just keep saying it that he had early stages of dementia that they had to treat him a certain way he kind that they had act a certain way around him that's not me saying yes early stages of dementia this is what they were saying during the campaign and talking about how they had to work around all of his limitations well it may not be new or surprising what we hear in this book but it's no less disconcerting because he's being said about the President of the United States by people who are his allies people who are working alongside him so we're just starting good at could could ask John really quickly a question on it do you want to hear what you're asking him about or do you want to ask him and then back into John I've read a couple and he's going to take a lot of right yeah you have answer that I'm gonna start talking about baseball now don't take ladies questions well of course I am I am in part from Alabama and Donald Trump believes that everybody from Alabama stupid he believes everybody from Alabama talks to the marbles in their mouth he believes everybody that when the University of Alabama is dumb and incapable of holding down a government job the insults on Alabama and Donald Trump they just this is it's it's been non-stop for a week insults attacking the great state of Alabama he did it in a Politico article he's doing it with Bob Woodward now he may hate Alabama but in the words of Skynyrd a southern man don't need him around anyhow well now that I've gotten through that because Mika thinks I'm incapable of asking a question because I went to the greatest at a university something on the planet right there this guy is I believe the phrase that he uses is mentally retarded he's this dumb southerner he couldn't even be a one person country lawyer down in Alabama that doesn't sound like no he has very flattered he has hatred and now he has hatred and contempt for my people and yes my people places that I grew up in and was raised and went to school in and one of the great state schools in America Alabama now let me get to the question hmm was your big takeaway from the book was there was there a certain story a certain element that struck you I'd say one after a series of books the previous the president we talks to was Gunn on tape with Woodward he says oh it's gonna be another one of these bad books he's had a bunch of bad books right Aaron Fury obviously the biggest selling so far now Woodward may exceed that who knows but there they all paint a consistent picture what's the one thing you do you draw through line from fire and fury most people don't I do not think Michael Wolfe has the kind of credibility Bob Woodward has in reporting inside White House accounts but the pictures in the two books are strikingly consistent as our books like the book by Omarosa all these books paint a consistent picture that's the first thing the second thing is they knew this book was coming out it had a publication date of next Tuesday if you had read anything about how Bob Woodward books work it's that the Washington Post somehow gets a copy of the book the previous week yet yesterday they were caught totally flat-footed and flabbergasted for hours before they mounted any kind of a critical response to your point about the southern thing it's interesting that it was one of the few things he picked up on yesterday and directly tweeted about was trying to refute the notion that he would ever criticize southerners because he recognizes his political vulnerability there there's other things to say about the hedged nature of some of these denials that he's citing the way it maddest is denial the way Kelly phrases denial we can go into that more detail but the last thing that I'll say is it just is a stunningly devastating picture not just of the president but up all the people around him and all these people who went to Woodward many of whom have now left the administration there are clear breadcrumbs of the lead to people like Gary Cohn and Rex Tillerson and other people in this book all of these people though come off as badly as the presidents do and the way in which they enabled him some of them acting as mica said like guardrails of democracy trying to save the world maybe Jim mattis falls in that category but a bunch of these other guys really look like they were in a culture of enabling the president's worse instincts rather than pushing back against him it is a very unflattering picture of everyone in that White House for the first day absolutely not have a presidency should function for sure and Carol Lee you see consistencies with other books and other reporting but also with your investigative reporting on this president his behavior his ability to contain himself in his temper you've seen it yeah and the big takeaway for me was looking at this it's just hard to fathom a President of the United States the commander in chief giving orders saying that he wanted certain policies to be adopted and the people around him essentially thinking that they know better and running a sort of tag-team operation where they would one of them would warn another one about the president's moving in a certain direction and they would all kind of mobilize to keep the president from doing what he wanted to do and our reporting show that you know we focused largely on the president is national security team and starting from last summer there was just this deterioration of that relationship and a constant battle between his national security advisors who wanted him to take measures that they thought were far better than the ones the president was proposing and a president who just they felt needed to be contained on everything from Afghanistan to the Korean Peninsula well looking through our own copy of the book there's so much to work with here's how NBC's Kristen Welker reported on it yesterday in his explosive new book Bob Woodward describes the Trump presidency in the midst of a nervous breakdown excerpts first obtained by The Washington Post quote aides calling it crazy town at times paralyzed by the Russia investigation and that possible interview with Robert I've always wanted to do an interview what we're describing the president's one-time lead attorney John Dowd so convinced the president would commit perjury he staged a practice interview last January that session so rocky Woodward reports mr. Dowd later told mr. Trump don't testify it's either that or an orange jumpsuit the book also a remarkable portrait of aides taking extreme measures to block their boss former economic adviser Gary cone reportedly preventing the president from withdrawing from a trade agreement with South Korea by swiping a letter off his desk and after the president told defense secretary James Madison eight Syrian dictator Bashar al-assad for a chemical attack on civilians mattis reportedly told the president on the phone he would do it but then telling a senior aide quote we're not going to do any of that and the book describing extraordinary insults from the president's staff Woodward writing mattis has described mr. Trump as having the understanding of a fifth or sixth grader and chief of staff John Kelly has called the president an idiot an account first reported by NBC News Kelly calling that accusation BS and another pathetic attempt to smear people close to president Trump and distract from the administration's many successes mattis calling the accusations the product of someone's rich imagination Woodward also describing a president laughing his own insults calling Attorney General Jeff Sessions a traitor mentally retarded and a dumb southerner Woodward didn't talk to President Trump for the book saying his requests went unanswered publishing this phone call with the president from last month how did you ask about speaking to me well about six people you know tell me the president responding in an interview with The Daily Caller saying it's just another bad book and Woodward had a lot of credibility problems Wow as you heard in Kristin's piece Woodward's book alleges set in the White House residence On January 27 the president's then personal attorney John Dowd peppered Trump with questions about the Russia investigation provoking stumbles contradictions and lies until the president evangeline lost his cool dad said that don't testify it's either that or an orange jumpsuit if it's decision time you're gonna go forward I can't be with you I think the President of the United States cannot be seen taking the fifth Trump said no no I'm a good witness I hope be a real good witness doubt knew this was self delusion you are not a good witness doubt said again Trump had one overriding problem that Dowd knew but could not bring himself to say to the president you're an expert of liar the book describes that on March 5th Dowd and Trump attorney Jay Sekulow met in Muller's office with the special counsel and as deputy word out in Sekulow re-enacted Trump's January practice this is the incredible part I think Willy that Dowd who we've always seen as being you know an opponent of robert muller they sit down and they both talk about the same problem they have as Americans yeah and Dowd said to Muller I'm not going to sit there and let him look like an idiot Dowd said the guys overseas are going to say I told you he was an idiot I told you he was a damn dumbbell what are you dealing with this idiot for and then Muller says John I understand so there you have it's extraordinary this is I think one of the most extraordinary parts of the book where Robert Mahler American is talking to Donald Trump's attorney also as an American and both of these two who were supposed to be on opposite sides are both saying we can't embarrass the President of the United States in the face of the world this way because he will look too stupid and it will actually hurt American interests abroad it's extraordinary on so many levels first of all we're hearing Bob Mahler's voice through Bob Woodward's book we don't hear Bob Mahler's voice very often and that you have the president's own attorney not just protecting the president United States this president President Trump in this case but protecting effectively the presidency and protect effectively the country from embarrassment by having the president testify in this way and remember doubt did quit shortly thereafter so clearly he didn't think that Donald Trump was gonna listen to him in the end and he wasn't at the Advocate perhaps Donald Trump that he thinks he can be remember he thinks if I sit across to somebody I'm gonna be able to make my case I'm gonna convince them I'm a sales but I can make this happen and doubt is telling him in no uncertain terms no sir you are not lawyers have an ethical obligation do that if they know that their client is committing perjury or is going to commit perjury they have to report that to the court this is mica obviously something that John Dowd knew that he was going to have to do if Donald Trump testified in an email to the Washington Examiner doubt wrote there was no so-called practice session or reenactment of a mock interview at the special counsel's office so John let's just be care about one thing let's be clear on one thing Muller there though is not at all seating the notion that he doesn't want trim to come and testify Muller is simply saying it's a high it actually rings true to how Muller would handle such thing which say I understand meaning I understand the nature of your problem I understand why you don't want to like it and testify I get it right doesn't mean I'm it doesn't mean I'm trying to protect the president or Donald Trump's presidency but I understand the nature of your problem as a lawyer that you have to hear me out nonetheless I still want the president to come and testify because you know wait what what also rings true here and I've been saying it for some time that it's been very clear and here Bob Woodward confirms it a thousand times over that the president is surrounded by lawyers and always has been surrounded by lawyers who think he's too stupid to sit down man-to-man across the table and talk to Robert Muller and you read what doubt is said you read what Sekulow is saying they all say one thing to his face Rudy Giuliani you know Rudy Giuliani I'll huff and puff but the bottom line is Giuliani believes like everybody else that Donald Trump is too stupid are too dis mentally scattered or maybe just unable to keep up with robert muller and he'll commit perjury well I think there's certainly what stupid is one possibility another obviously is saying what the law yes yes I think you know I understand as I've said I would always be insulted that they're thinking that just because he went to st. Paul's oh here's a fine school by the way yes well I've heard not not like some of the better public schools in Alabama but but still a decent school or Andover yeah but yeah like but st. Paul's is still a really good school yeah and then you got you got your Princeton he went to Princeton yeah and it's so it's almost like they're thinking his lawyers are thinking that a guy from Queens can't keep up with Robert and Waller who then went the you said you've made a law school they know they know and so they they don't just like everybody else around him they all think he's dumb they all think he's stupid they all say he's an idiot they all think he's and I'd be really insulted if I were the president yeah thought that about me I I know you would and and I know I God knows no one would ever think that you were too dumb to go up against some Andover Princeton grad but because you were educated some of the best schools but the other thing they could think is that in addition to or separate from that he's a pathological liar and that he will lie well regardless of whether his what his mental state is recovers what his intellectual capacity is that the president will commit perjury because either the facts the truth are bad right he will lie to avoid telling the trying or he doesn't even know what the truth is because you suggest a second ago not so much that he is dumb again just putting myself in the minds of his lawyers that's why he's lost track of reality one where the some of those some combination of some combination of those things are clearly what his lawyers thing see all of his lawyers think it would be mistake for him to sit with bottom it's reminiscent thought about Muller and his team I think we have to be clear here that it's all the people around him that are calling him dumb and saying he's is he's like a fifth or sixth grader in intelligence that's an insult to a lot of fifth and sixth graders but there's no doubt that they think this guy is not man enough to sit across it Abell from robert muller and he doesn't have the the capabilities the mental capabilities do it and can you imagine me president he get elected the united states know what you can't even imagine being the host of the show and having people think that about you right well they think that about me but that's different okay okay I can live with it not only did they believe that the doubt held a session to convince the president of that he said here's what it'll look like pretend I'm Bob Mahler and we'll have this back and forth and let's see how this goes right and after thirty minutes according to Woodward's book Donald Trump himself conceded at okay I don't want to I think the president stops is right okay I think he's responding he's ignorant his kindness at this point Carol Lee oh I think he's a president you're not the president doubts not the president he has to be smart he should testify wouldn't Muller maybe yeah me and so I would like to see that Carol Lee let's talk about John Kelly calls at crazy town and certainly in Bob Woodward's descriptions has his own opinions about the president that came out and his denials cuz everyone's denying it this morning inside the White House sound a lot like the denials he gave you that when you had similar reporting yeah it's almost identical mica he said that you know when we reported a couple months ago that john kelly had referred multiple times to the president as an idiot behind his back essentially thought that he was he knew better than the president and was acting as if he had gotten elected you know john kelly issued a statement and called our story BS and said that he and the president have a very candid relationship but he's never called him an idiot and we saw yesterday he issued almost an identical statement saying the same thing you know we've also reported on secretary mattis and his relationship with the president and he's you know how that they've had sign of sort of a falling out and that the President believes that mattis looks down on him and doesn't and slow walks a lot of his policies which he does and and I think that the question now is you know the president was not blind to all of this our reporting shows that he was aware that the what his the people around him thought about him going back to and Rec still called him a moron and but that was when it was private and now it's all out there in public and so how the president responds to that what moves he makes whether he fires anybody whether he moves to further isolate some of the people that still are around him who he now knows and the world knows feel this way about him is something that I think is going to be really interesting to watch because clearly you know a number of and the national security team in particular of those folks have have been blocking him from making what most foreign policy experts would tell you would be really disastrous policy position sounds like they're doing the 25th amendment without actually doing the 25th amendment it looks like me I'd fire all the attorneys all right so heading to get that respect you you know what I mean yeah you're president in your attorney still think you're too stupid to talk to me Robert Muller and not man enough to you know he calls it whatever calls it an administrative coup d'etat in the book at the ministry coup d'etat we're gonna bring in New York Times reporter Michael Jones and producer who has brand-new reporting on the potential of Bob Muller and Donald Trump coming face-to-face Plus thanks
