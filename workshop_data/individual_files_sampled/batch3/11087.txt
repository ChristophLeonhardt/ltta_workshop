North and South Korea have held their first official talks in more than two years the negotiations took place in the demilitarized zone between the two countries artis Murad Ghazni F has been following developments it went well which is rare to hear these days when it comes to the Koreas one North Korea agreed to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang sports people performers for the cultural events it's simple at the North attends the Olympics it's much less likely to stage a provocation launch another missile to family reunions relatives separated by the war that haven't seen each other for decades could be allowed reunions next month and three BAPS most importantly South Korea has proposed face-to-face meetings between the north and the south military officials in order to deescalate tensions at long last ultimately to denuclearize the peninsula it's a long shot but it's a start would it not bow to do I think we should be engaged in these talks in an earnest sincere manner to give a New Year's gift namely the results of the talks to the Korean nation as you mentioned earlier we hope to bring a precious gift to your people that matches the expectations of our people it has been a chaotic year from escalation to escalation sabre-rattling and childish rhetoric near enough every month the u.s. and South Korea would stage war games on the North's borders that sends a message they even sent nuclear bombers to the North's borders North Korea was no less provocative they tested increasingly advanced ballistic missiles stage suspected nuclear weapons tests and it now reportedly has the capacity to hit mainland United States and Kim jong-un has boasted he has his own button and his desk was part of who his button is bigger contest with Trump which is why these talks were so important they allow for a pause for hot heads to cool off and for tightened fingers to ease off on the triggers I think it's a step back from a military solution because there is no military solution other than death and destruction of hundreds of thousands or a million people or more in the long run both sides would benefit from peace whether there are people within each government that have an objective to maintain this conflict to maintain the battle state that probably are however it you know so it's hard to say put North Korea into one camp however I see what can come from the talks is a type of peace act treaty and a type of situation where these countries can learn to live in peace and that's only going to come from building relationships latest talks follow months of saber rattling between North Korea and the US however Donald Trump claims it was his aggressive attitude towards Pyongyang that made the diplomatic breakthrough possible totally destroyed North Korea that's called the military option the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of that regime require a determined response little rocket man is a sick puppy a lot of people have said a lot of people have written that without my rhetoric and without my tough stance and it's not just a stance I mean this is this is what has to be done if it has to be done that they wouldn't be talking about Olympics if they wouldn't be talking right now to discuss this further we're now joined by Jim Janice former US diplomat Jim thank you very much indeed for joining us well as we've just heard there are some key breakthroughs on upcoming military talks Olympic attendance and family reunions but how significant is this for North and South Korea Kate I think it's hugely significant and maybe we will have a happy new year I think this is very very welcome news that there is a constructive dialogue going on between the two Koreas and I hope something comes of it I mean that when all said and done the political arrangements on the peninsula between the two countries are paramount here and if they're talking I think that leaves a lot less room for other countries notably the United States to complain about things well as you mentioned that the u.s. I mean that government welcomed the negotiations but do you think Washington is happy about being sidelined in these talks I you know that's a real question here again President Trump is taking he's taking credit for this because of his hard rhetoric now was there some element of choreography here that the more belligerent we sounded the more it encouraged some kind of a side dialogue between the two Koreas I suspect that at least in the president's mind this is a welcome development whether it is around some of the people who are advising them that's another story well let's look at the North Korean delegation they made it clear they will not denuclearize they're saying our weapons are aimed only aimed at the United States I should say not our brethren nor China and Russia well do you think then that Seoul will feel reassured by them I think maybe somewhat reassured but not very much remember there are almost 30,000 Americans in South Korea American forces and no doubt they will still be targeted there are many more Americans in Japan and you notice he didn't say he wouldn't target the Japanese of whom the Koreans are not particularly fond I do think it would be a huge mistake though for the United States to say that we will only talk if the object of the negotiation is denuclearization if the US wants to go into that position fine but you cannot expect the other side to agree before talks take place on what the outcome should be right the object should be to extend that what is now a kind of a mirror moratorium between our exercises with the South Koreans and the North Korean tests that's pretty much what the Russians and Chinese have been proposing they're not calling a double freeze but maybe we can get to a double freeze and finally German South Korea will temporarily lift sanctions to allow the north to attend the Pyeongchang games that was that was actually the preamble for these talks I mean could this provide a lifeline for the North isolated economy though I think it's a little too soon to talk about their economy but if we have a reopening of the so-called sunshine policy which then can branch in to economic development that's great the fact that North is sending a team to Pyeongchang is great in fact the previous Olympics the north and the south even though they competed separately even marched in the opening ceremonies under the same flag the same unification flag and I hope they do that on this occasion as well yeah I think that has been talked about in today thank you Jim Jose former US diplomat thank you
