1
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:08,309
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> d you doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right how things get</font>

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,669
indeed things are certainly going how

3
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:13,820
about you yeah things going to write

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,260
it's just nicely relaxing for the day

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,740
yeah I hear you I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be honest I</font>

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,119
don't even know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> chilling is anymore</font>

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,090
how do you mean there's just so much to

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,449
do and so little time I just don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

9
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">chance to switch off really well it's</font>

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,509
important that you take care of yourself

11
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:33,450
or you burn out well I've already

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,470
accepted that's going to happen how so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,350
I just live a very intense lifestyle I

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,970
mean the things have happened to me in

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,640
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past five years is just incredible</font>

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,880
and I just think as I'm living<font color="#CCCCCC"> life so</font>

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,010
fast I'm probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to even live</font>

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,670
till about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 really well surely that's</font>

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,180
a motivation to slow down no it's not

20
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,740
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in the world at the</font>

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,270
moment is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to slow down just</font>

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I choose to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you that</font>

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">you should be taken care of yourself</font>

24
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">first and then that puts you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

25
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:06,990
stronger position to be taken care of

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,990
others I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking care of</font>

27
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,460
financially secure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got decent</font>

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,109
health but that might change if you

29
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:15,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't calm down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit I mean you wear a</font>

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,560
mouthguard when you sleep stop grinding

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,020
your teeth how can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just--can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sit</font>

32
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">there with everything happening in the</font>

33
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,689
world at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing nothing</font>

34
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,219
because I know things aren't going to

35
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:25,109
change in this exact moment but if you

36
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:27,509
do nothing nothing is going to happen I

37
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,460
mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a mentality that is just so</font>

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,960
widespread at the moment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get it I mean there's sixteen</font>

40
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,369
thousand children a day dying in the

41
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,020
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of hunger when we could</font>

42
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,579
actually prevent it from happening today

43
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:45,659
I mean it's ludicrous who was that I

44
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,929
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friend sara saara yeah we're</font>

45
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:50,579
hanging out tonight with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our friends you</font>

46
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,009
should come<font color="#CCCCCC"> along no I can't I've got</font>

47
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,079
too much to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now well I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

48
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,909
would do you some good you might even

49
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,889
find someone you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like and I mean</font>

50
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:01,409
finding a girlfriend could be the key

51
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,909
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you chilling the fuck out yeah I'm</font>

52
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,530
not interested why not because because

53
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,140
I'm just an intense person and I'm

54
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,130
always doing project

55
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,800
and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in a relationship if I</font>

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,320
can invest quality time with them and I

57
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,510
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> scare them off anyway I've</font>

58
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">already done that once you know what I'm</font>

59
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to say if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do nothing nothing</font>

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,790
will happen and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the</font>

61
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,280
faith but I do have faith I just invest

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,590
it into things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter hey miles</font>

63
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,460
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> well I definitely think with some</font>

64
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,810
reflection we could learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot from</font>

65
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,060
each other yeah I completely agree miles

66
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,130
I'm willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make the effort shake on</font>

67
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:49,680
it of course i am the balance of my

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:03:00,710
extremes hey everyone hope all is well

69
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,850
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get asked quite a lot is</font>

70
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,230
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not i read the comments on my</font>

71
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,090
videos and I really can't stress enough

72
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,640
I read every single one I mean the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

73
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,380
reason I make these videos is I like to

74
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,000
hear different opinions from different

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,800
people and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a very personal</font>

76
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,380
video for me it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about how sometimes</font>

77
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,430
in life we have conflicting personality

78
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,860
traits so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question today is</font>

79
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,170
do you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any extremes in your</font>

80
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,970
personalities do you have any extreme

81
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,590
traits which are at odds with each other

82
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,600
