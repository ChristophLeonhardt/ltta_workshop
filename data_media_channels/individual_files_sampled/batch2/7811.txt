the US Food and Drug Administration has said on Thursday that the drug maker endo pharmaceuticals must remove a powerful opioid painkiller called opana er from the market and the agency is saying that this is the first time they are calling for an opioid to be taken off the market due to quote the public health consequences of abuse so a little bit more of what the FDA is saying we are facing an opioid epidemic a public health crisis and we must take all necessary steps to reduce the scope of opioid misuse and abuse we will continue to take regulatory steps when we see situations where an opioid products risks outweigh its benefits not only for its intended patient population but also in regard to its potential for misuse and abuse so just to give you some background on opana this drug is about twice as powerful as oxy cotton and other often abused opioids the FDA approved it in 2006 and they have tried to make measures so that it's more difficult to abuse they made a hard outer coating so it's more difficult to crush however when the drug maker changed the formula in 2012 some addicts began injecting it instead in the Indiana case the shared needles helped spread the HIV infection to over 142 people the United States as you guys may know is in the midst of an opioid overdose epidemic according to the US Centers for Disease Control prevention opioid overdose killed more than 33,000 people in 2015 more than any year on record nearly half of all overdose deaths involve some sort of prescription drug and we're going to get into that in the the second half of the story with a new study coming out by the New York Times but just to get your reaction on this half of the story - - there and endo Pharmaceuticals has released a statement in part saying despite the FDA's request to withdraw upon a TR from the market this request does not indicate uncertainty with the product safety or efficacy when taken as prescribed endo remains confident in the body of evidence established through clinical research demonstrating that open a R has a favorable risk benefit profile when used as intended in appropriate patients so the the larger question here before we get into more details on the opioid epidemic in America is is endo to blame here are they doing enough it's so difficult for doctors to make sure that patients are not abusing these prescriptions what do you think about this coming out about this particular drug well I think I mean no company is necessarily responsible for what people do when they don't use a product as intended it's theoretically but some products are easier to use and unintended ways and some products that are designed to be as strong as possible it's not that that's the problem it's when you then combine that with lobbyists for these gigantic pharma companies they're pushing it to be prescribed as many people as possible you naturally increase the odds that some people are going to overdose on it or use it in appropriate ways yes I was thinking I was trying to cite this beforehand but there was this study about most patients not being aware that their doctors were in some way incentivized to prescribe the things that they prescribed and when you look at the pharmaceutical lobbies and the lack of transparency in in that case I just mentioned it's sort of insane when you compare this against the scope of the war on drugs and how harshly penalize people have been for things like marijuana which I would say are not responsible for it not three thousand three thousand addiction related deaths yeah it's just probably lower it's interesting to just kind of follow where the money goes yeah I think it is interesting that sort of the the default in the majority of states is on prescription pain medication rather than investing in maybe because I'm a marijuana user for my own like medical reasons as well and it's interesting to see that I live in a state where that you need I can go to a doctor and have medical marijuana prescribed whereas in another state for my medical issues I might be prescribed and I in the past I have been prescribed I was prescribed oxycontin and oxycodone at one point in time that since si knew how it did not help me it was horrible it was a bad time um so it's just really it's strange to see that there is obviously a correlation bigoted between people abusing these drugs and people who are being prescribed these drugs and it's hard to find exactly what level of accountability we need to have and yet there still aren't really any major proposed solutions aside from well just pull them pull this one off the market but a lot of people in this and we're getting our information from CNN we're saying you know I more needs to be done it's great that opana is now being taken off the market but this is just one of many I mean fentanyl is another one that's being do abused it goes on and on and I think that that will sort of segue us over into an article from voxcom and they are taking their information from a new report from the New York Times and basically the the tagline on this story and why it's making a lot of headlines is in one year drug overdoses killed more Americans in the entire Vietnam War did so they are sort of breaking this down and also providing a little bit of an explanation that I want to dive into with you guys as well The Times contacted local and state agencies across the u.s. to come up with a rough estimate of people who have died from drug overdoses and it calculated that 59 thousand to 65 thousand people died of overdoses last year and that is more than the 58,000 US soldiers who died in the Vietnam War so a little bit more on the background and the opioid epidemic explained back in the 1990's doctors were persuaded to treat pain as a serious medical issue there's a good reason for that about a hundred million US adults suffer from chronic pain according to a 2011 report from the Institute of Medicine pharmaceutical companies took advantage of this concern through a big marketing campaign they got doctors to prescribe products like oxycontin and percocet in droves even though the evidence for opioids treating long-term chronic pain is very weak despite their effectiveness and short-term acute pain while the evidence that opioids cause harm in the long term is very strong so lobbying we're seeing it right so that really speaks exactly to what you were saying Kim and I think it's something that we don't talk about enough and I think that most people are just unaware of that there is an incentive oftentimes for people to be prescribed the pain medication that they're being prescribed and I think there should be more transparency would you agree yeah I would like to know if my doctor was compensated to prescribe me a specific prescription drug yeah yeah it's weird if like theoretically if you're on Instagram and you've gotten $1,000 for sunglasses or fit T that you have to be transparent about that you know exactly yeah like we talked about the the relative culpability these different groups and stuff it's easy to say is a drug being misused or used in irresponsible way but that doesn't just mean one thing it doesn't just mean that a person's crushing it and inject it person can misuse it but a doctor can misuse that a company can misuse it when you look at this chart and you see you know if you can see it here you see the deaths shooting up now starting in 99 what did people not have pain back in 1999 I think we had roughly the same amount of pain we just didn't have the same number of deaths because we treated pain differently which means that something like 40,000 deaths last year alone could have been avoided and when you look at this the size under that graph you're talking about hundreds of thousands of deaths that did not need to happen in one year uh you're looking at almost twice as many people as died in car accidents and think about it everybody basically drives we drive a lot every day far fewer people do drugs prescription or otherwise I mean that is a crazy increased risk there and an unnecessary one as is clear from the 1999 example yeah and from from my own personal experience I remember when I was being prescribed it was some it was like maybe percocet to the whole bunch of all it was so it was following a knee surgery but what ended up happening was that I was given a huge prescription that because of other factors in my life I wouldn't ever all say that I was addicted at all but I definitely had a sort of dependency that messed with my brain a lot and I so I base I understand that I was given this amount of percocet that I didn't need I had knee surgery I needed it for about a week to get over it and I had enough pills for a much longer time than that which is that's the sort of accountability and transparency that I think we need from doctors to be like okay this is what she's going through pain medication is okay in doses but it just seems like there wasn't any oversight whereas like she's having a surgery I trust her she'll be fine she's an athlete she'll be okay and you can't put that on a patient because you have no idea what they might be predisposed for so a little bit more on what we can do as far as a solution well Vox is saying the likely solution is to get opioid users into treatment according to a 2016 report by the Surgeon General just 10% of Americans with a drug use disorder obtain specialty treatment the report found that the low rate was largely explained by a shortage of treatment options does that jive with what you guys know about drug addiction do you feel like there's a shortage of treatment options well I think it's only seems like the money is in getting people to buy more drugs than they they actually need then why isn't the money in the treatment that to me that could be a very lucrative business I've seen interventions be really decked out that seems like this oh yeah that's true for people who can afford really fancy I think that the government needs to get more involved in terms of funding that there was actually quite a bit of discussion on both the Republican and Democratic side from some politicians before the election about how to deal with this and people like not just the Democratic candidates but John Kasich for instance made a big deal out of this issue but then Donald Trump got elected and he doesn't seem to care at all about it certainly doesn't talk about it much and so the impetus to actually fix it at the federal level seems to have largely gone away and that blows my mind how we're not looking to fix this at a federal level now especially when you have to imagine that a lot of the people that make up those 59,000 debts are not hippy libs from the coasts it's Republicans Republicans who live in Tennessee in Kentucky and everywhere across the country it affects all classes of people it affects all races of people and all partisan identifications it's a it should be the problem it's easiest to solve for the u.s. but it seems to be one that we're willing to keep kicking the can down the road and letting tens of thousands of people unnecessarily divert you and to that exact point my dad is a chaplain on the Ohio River region and I was talking to him just yesterday and he has he's been talking about the the two reasons why he does funerals or why he's really called to serve or because of officers committing suicide or people who are committing suicide that that's not something you talk about in the second is over drug overdoses because of the the time that they're on these ships we're starting on a Coast Guard or on the tow boats and that's just something that it's not treated and he was saying it literally just yesterday before I knew we were covering this story he's like you look around at the funeral at this family for someone who's died for some for a drug that they were prescribed yeah it's insane Young Turks now has over 6 billion lifetime views you know who did that you did that we're now larger the CNN ABC you name a news network online were larger than them and you built all that as everyone scoffed and didn't believe and here we are guys thanks to you build in the meta media together with us at TYT Network dot-com /join
