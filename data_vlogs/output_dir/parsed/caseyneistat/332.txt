encounters than ever had sorry couldn't

York City these are canvases flip-flops

fluorescent woven bag that's it that's
everything she needs Candice took
Francine earlier this morning I'm going
to meet them now I don't know what the
day holds but Candice does have the car
with her so maybe we'll go somewhere new
today also I'm wearing Candace's purse
and I kind of like it that was wait
I think they're in here hey where's the
baby it's like a crazy junk it's like a
crazy dollar toy store everything's with
Sheila she loves it there by hat yeah
no cars summer streets every summer in
August they close down these streets
some people can just walk and hang out
it's a pretty special thing
thanks New York City
dad
this is our first weekend in the city
without the Connecticut House and we're
having fun so far and the summer is
almost over but yeah it's a it's a
change
bernzini off the table you know what I
didn't like was going back every single
weekend today we need to sell it it's
nice if it's done
great I had a salad Candace had ribs
dick we're going back to the we're going
home now
we're in New Jersey now the baby's
asleep
and we're going to some shopping outlets
this is how we spend our first weekend
without the house in Connecticut he's so
excited
with all the stuff that's what happens
this is it nestled in the bosom of these
hills you just wanted a fake bosom we've
arrived at the shopping outlets oh I
need to go there because I ripped my
pants from there how do you want to do
this hello there my boosted board I
could just feel it around and what about
me
I'll see you what I'm done Frandsen eat
are you away we're there which story
you're gonna go to Gucci
what are you maybe you stop doing this
to me you're doing every time I go
shopping this is Sophia Tanja shopping
trip vest was a mild success I always
wanted all these things and I thought if
I just had all these things that I'd be
super happy and now that I'm like an
adult with a job most things I can
probably afford like if I want a new
pair of shoes or a new pair of pants or
video games or like within reason if
there's something I really want I can
just go buy it but the reality is no
matter how much crap i buy it doesn't
really move the needle on like my
happiness or sense of fulfillment or
really anything in life the only thing
that I really want is more time 5:15 I
wish had more time today
go on the 42nd Street well I thought you
get to my house faster that doesn't make
any sense
I thought you wanted to see the baby
family trip for the movies that's my
brother Dean and my kid Owen back there
we're gonna go see The Bourne Identity
there's a movie theater that's like one
block from where we live but I want to
go to Times Square so we're going to the
Times Square theater
come on who sit
you might have to tell me the other rope
I got a belt I went through an ankle
deep puddle got soaked got soaked
boosted word got majorly wet now it's no
function no function
we still haven't caught up to us boots
it's not working never came back to life
this is a boosted board it's still
automatic this requires Dean to pedal
instead of the motors your jockey
- does not appreciate safety ran me into
the curb this is Time Square the kids
lost the kids this is Times Square
here's Dean here where the kids are
let's run out of here on
this my ticket major situation here at
the movie theater for everyone
considering coming to this theater with
your skateboard they have a very strict
no skateboard policy I had to put my
skateboard in my backpack
it's not really my backpack if it my
skateboard in my backpack in order to
bring it in
I know the Yellowstone they they
otherwise people the movies starting out
inspect a full review when it's over
57 on Rotten Tomatoes I thought it was
great I give it a big fat thumbs up for
Jason Bourne
especially that car chase at the end my
god I was crazy
I linked you out of Times Square I would
also like still can't get the boosted
we're going I'm gonna have to run a city
bike home I don't have to carry my
boosted board on a city bike oh I don't
think I've been on a city bike since God
invented the boosted board
goodbye city bye good bye
Kandice send me a text saying get milk
honey and this kind of bread alright
that's it this has been a very long
weekend edition of the vlog I'm gonna go
ahead and end it right there and you
know you do it too that's why you're
laughing when we go shopping it goes
like this I go first and I figure out
all the things that I want and then I
pay for them and then I harass Candace
until it's time to go is that a fair
characterization
