day four seven four of this Trump administration brings new allegations that President Trump's personal lawyer took half a million dollars from a Russian oligarch much more on that in just about 30 seconds but first we want to catch you up on tonight's primary races across the country if you've been watching you know we've been keeping a close eye on that West Virginia Republican Senate primary president Trump weighed in on that contest urging voters to choose anybody but Don Blankenship it appears they have done just that NBC News has called this race for Patrick Morrissey tonight in West Virginia Blankenship the coal Baron ex-con came in third we have complete results from Steve Kornacki at the big board coming up a bit later on in our broadcast back to our lead story more on this bombshell news that the company Michael Cohen used to pay a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to a porn star also received massive sums of money from an investment firm with ties to a Russian oligarch who was in turn close to Vladimir Putin a document first released tonight by stormy Daniels attorney Michael avenatti laid out the allegations this way mr. Victor vex vekselberg and his cousin mr. Andrew in traitor routed eight payments to mr. Cohen through a company named Columbus Nova LLC beginning in January 2017 continuing until at least August 2017 according to the documents those payments added up to approximately $500,000 and it quote appears that these funds may have replenished the account following the payment to Miz Clifford aka stormy Daniels the documents also reveal payments from corporations like Novartis the pharma giant AT&T Korea aerospace here is Michael avenatti on this network in just the past hour there's no question that this has all the markings of a pay-to-play type news scenario this is a president who ran on this whole candidacy of draining the swamp and the lobbyists were going to be closed out of the process and they weren't going to be allowed into the White House anymore and meanwhile now we find out that you have Michael Cohen who had an office next to Donald Trump in Trump Tower for many many years and this guy appears to be selling access to the President it√≠d States NBC News has also reviewed financial documents that appear to support a vanadis account of these transactions of note these transactions would have taken place after the election and Wild Trump's ties to Russia were already under investigation former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara talked about what we know thus far tonight on CNN at a minimum it's it's a very strange look for the president's personal lawyer knowing all these allegations knowing that any connection certainly between folks who have ties to Putin and you know deposits of large amounts of money would look suspicious and maybe maybe there's no crime and maybe there was nothing necessarily untoward about it but but it sure looks mighty fishy and you shouldn't be surprised that there may be two different offices looking at this critical part of that statement there at the very end shouldn't be surprised that there may be two different offices looking at this the company in question issued a statement late tonight reading in part Columbus Nova is a management company solely owned and controlled by Americans after the inauguration the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false the claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved or provided any funding for Columbus Nova's engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else other than Columbus Nova's owners were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement from the very effective law firm Latham and Watkins tonight here too make sense of all of it our leadoff panel on a Tuesday evening Frank figures ease back with us former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence who in the past has worked for among others one Robert Muller John Heilemann co-author of Game Change and DoubleDown as well as co-host and executive producer of the circus on Showtime Sam Stein veteran political journalist now politics editor for The Daily Beast and Jill Colvin White House reporter for The Associated Press all right Frank you're the former Fed here we read the statement by Latham and Watkins the will let that speak for itself what do you make of tonight's development Brian I think we're much closer tonight to seeing what collusion looks like I think we're much closer to the original core of the special counsels purpose which is to determine the extent to which foreign powers have influenced this campaign and influenced this presidency and I think that Michael Cohen is much closer to criminal charges tonight and our president is not going to sleep well this evening because it's going to be very hard for him to assert that he did not know that Cohen had this firm setup that money was flowing from Columbus Nova whose biggest client is a Russian oligarch who has written checks to the campaign who has signed on with Columbus Nova who has been interviewed by the FBI at a New York Airport and we're supposed to believe that the president knew nothing about this tonight it's quite possible that Muller is looking at Cohen as a unregistered foreign agent that he's looking at crimes like money laundering and bank fraud but that most importantly it's possible tonight that the president is being looked at as either an accessory after the fact for if he knew that the money was coming from Russia to Cohen and if in fact it was for nefarious purposes or that he might be looked at as a co-conspirator with Cohen John Heilemann when our friend Frank speaks I tend to listen for reasons like that that gets your attention when the story broke tonight it was just an unlikely place the attorney for stormy Daniels Michael avenatti this was not in the form of a press release from the Southern District of New York for example and their promises to be more of these type developments as it happens I was sitting with Michael avenatti in his hotel when he sent the tweet that launched all this news coverage and he's a little bit he's been quite cagey about the source of how he came to this knowledge what I think we know is that over the last few days some pieces have fallen into place we saw the New York Times write about vekselberg a story that talked about how Robert Muller was looking at him we also saw the New York Times roughly on the same time do their big take out on Michael Cohen's businesses and one of the most striking things about that in addition to the connect kind of questionable nature of some of them and the low-rent nature of some of them is the number of times the word Russia occurred if you did a search through that story the connections to Russians to Russia to Russian money to potentially to businesses that have the whiff and sometimes more than the whiff of Russian mob business money laundering and so on things like the taxi medallion business in New York City which famously has been a mafia controlled business for a long time before there were Russian about Russian mobsters it was Italian mobsters here in the city and used it basically to launder money so what you're talking about you're you're a babe in the woods on this so now we have this which is sort of like the bruh is brought together the Vekselberg story which we know Muller's looking at and the Cohen story which we know but Muller looked at enough that he referred to the Southern District and you've now got the crossing of the streams in some sense and it's true that stormy Daniels is a peripheral character in some ways in this story except for the fact that she received money from Michael Cohen from this account that was set up that looks now to all the world like a hush money like a slush fund for paying out all kinds of payments there's a lot of money flowing in and out of that one account it may not be the only account and and I will say as much as we're focused on Vekselberg correctly the interesting thing as we go forward is going to be where the rest that money go you know what else will what else was Michael Cohen who's the self-described fixer yeah fixing problems only had three clients political the present political and legal problems mostly for Donald Trump millions of dollars flowing in and out of a slush fund we know I throw a hundred thirty thousand have it went to stormy Daniels where the rest of it go Sam I have so many questions for you including kind of a devil's advocate thing pay-to-play is a it's kind of a white-collar thing there's no evidence that these payments violated any laws let's take the case of AT&T AT&T is trying like hell to merge with Time Warner it's held up in the courts they knew that Donald Trump was said to be against the merger so they're looking to find friends of Donald Trump how do we get around this they have admitted tonight that that's us and the payment ledger we made some we received according to their statement they receive zero in services for their money but what's wrong here well I guess technically is not illegal but it is underhanded it is rather unethical it is the swamp that Trump talked about and while John is right that it is very interesting to know where this money went once it was in the slush fund for me the more interesting is how do they know to put it in there in the first place this is not some well-known LLC in fact it was not known at all until about a month ago someone must have told them hey if you want to curry favor with us go to essential consulting or whatever it's called LLC that's run by Michael Cohen no one's going to Michael Cohen for real estate advice no one's going to Michael Cohen for lobbying help news consulting or business consulting no offense to Michael Cohen they're going to Michael cone cuz he is close to the president but someone had to direct him to this place to begin with and who wasn't that directed them to that place how heroin must it be to be Michael Cohen and no yeah what the feds well he was with Michael avenatti when the store broke I was in a hotel room with Michael Cohen when I was not another no it's probably it's probably petrifying his life is unraveling before his eyes and it brings a truism to the surface which is that Donald Trump's presidency has been a virtual in actual disaster for everyone closely associated on Trump their lives have been upended all their business dealings have been exposed and a lot of the nefarious underbelly of it all has been brought to the surface which brings us to Jill Colvin an honest to goodness deadline journalist who was up well past her normal bedtime to talk to us tonight Jill two people who've been silent this evening Trump and Giuliani any guess as to their status yeah we've heard nothing from them and remember this is the big day when the president is supposed to be announcing his big decision on Iran he probably expected to return to the White House residence tonight to turn on the television to see how people were reacting to that and once again he's turning on the television to Michael avenatti what I think it's so interesting here is to go back to a point you guys were making a little bit ago is this idea that you know this is a president who came in here saying he was gonna drain the swamp and yet you see person after person who really seems to be trying to profit off of the trump presidency you've got the president's children who have certainly benefited running the Trump brands because of the trump presidency you've got other folks around you know like his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski who've tried to use their connections to the White House and to the president their understanding of what makes the president tick how he thinks to enrich themselves hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube
