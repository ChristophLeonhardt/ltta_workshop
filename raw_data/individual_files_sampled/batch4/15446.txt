let not your heart be troubled Trump's star is not going anywhere and I'm going to tell you why today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel as many of you have heard and are predictably and justifiably freaking out over the city of West Hollywood City Council voted on a resolution to ask the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove President Donald Trump star from the Hollywood Walk of Fame for to one vote which is no surprise because the City of West Hollywood City Council is a complete joke as a lot of you know I sit on the board for Log Cabin Republicans and many of those folks are residents of West Hollywood they are members of the LGBT community and all of them have firmly testified to the fact that this mayor and his council are complete dopes the mayor posted this tweet on Twitter on Monday night West Hollywood City Council unanimously passes resolution asking the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove the Donald Trump star on Hollywood Walk of Fame they also went on to tell Fox News this the West Hollywood City Council did not pass the resolution because Donald Trump is a conservative or a Republican earning a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is an honor when one belittles and attacks minorities immigrants Muslims people with disabilities or women the honor to the honor no longer exists now of course we all know how laughable that this is considering how many pedophiles rapists serial abusers and all-around terrible people have stars on the Walk of Fame that are not in Jane danger of removal but let not your heart be troubled this is basically just symbolic kind of like the mayor of West Hollywood giving the key to the city to stormy Daniels the City of West Hollywood has no official connection or power over the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce which is the body that handles the management and upkeep of the Hollywood Walk of Fame they released a statement from Lehren Gubler who is the president and oh of Hollywood Chamber of Commerce regarding West Hollywood's motion and he said this once we receive a communication from the West City of West Hollywood it will be referred to our Executive Committee for consideration at their next meeting as of now there are no plans to remove any stars from the Hollywood Walk of Fame the West Hollywood City Council does not have jurisdiction over the Hollywood Walk of Fame now I don't think it would ever happen can you imagine the dominoes that that would fall if it did not to mention the damage to tourism because let's be real not everyone who comes to visit LA is a raging brainless Trump hating liberal you've got a lot of middle America who support the president who visit Los Angeles this would sorely damage their tourism so personally I don't see this happening if I get any indication that I think that this is going to proceed I will obviously let you know I wasn't sure what the current state of the star was after that idiot took a pickaxe to it a few weeks ago so I popped up to the boulevard to check it out and Here I am of course I had to snap the picture quickly before someone poured a drink on me punched me berated me calling me racist sexist ignorant bigot curse word curse word curse word you know the drill but hey that's being a trump supporter in 2018 so again any updates on this and I will keep you posted thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
