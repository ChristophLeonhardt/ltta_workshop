1
00:00:00,526 --> 00:00:01,093
CHEATING.

2
00:00:01,093 --> 00:00:01,760
OF COURSE, WE ARE ALL SURE

3
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,430
THEY'RE NOT CHEATING JUST IN

4
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,097
CASE.

5
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:06,865
>> Harris: JUST IN CASE.

6
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:10,703
TOM DUPREE?

7
00:00:10,703 --> 00:00:11,403
>> Tom: I THINK THE PRESIDENT

8
00:00:11,403 --> 00:00:12,738
IS VERY COMFORTABLE WHERE HE IS

9
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:13,539
RIGHT NOW.

10
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:15,808
KEEP IN MIND, HIS BACKGROUND IS

11
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,876
AS A NEGOTIATOR AND THIS IS THE

12
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:18,877
BIGGEST NEGOTIATION ON THE

13
00:00:18,877 --> 00:00:21,313
BIGGEST STAGE WE'VE SEEN.

14
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,514
THE FACT IS THE PRESIDENT'S

15
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:24,416
POSITIONING THIS FOR A SITUATION

16
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,385
IN WHICH HE CAN NEGOTIATE

17
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:28,721
AGGRESSIVELY CREATIVELY AND

18
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:29,154
UNPREDICTABLY.

19
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,522
I THINK THAT HE IS DOING A VERY

20
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:33,158
SMART THING RIGHT NOW AND

21
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:33,826
SENDING THESE PUBLIC SIGNALS

22
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,627
BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO

23
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,196
IS THEY ARE GOING TO CONDITION

24
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:38,197
THE NEGOTIATING LANDSCAPE FROM

25
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:40,332
WHEN HE FINALLY SITS DOWN WITH

26
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:40,733
NORTH KOREA.

27
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:41,467
>> Harris: REAL QUICKLY BEFORE

28
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:43,402
WE OPEN IT WIDER TO THE COUCH,

29
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:45,437
YOU WORKED FOR PREVIOUS

30
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:46,805
ADMINISTRATION OF MY

31
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:47,539
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH AND I'M

32
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,408
CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK

33
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,943
OF WHERE THIS PRESIDENT IS

34
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:52,411
TAKING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

35
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:53,379
BECAUSE HE WORKED FOR AN

36
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:54,079
ADMINISTRATION AND YOU CAN SEE

37
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,715
WHAT THAT PRESIDENT DID.

38
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:58,317
>> Tom: THERE'S NO QUESTION

39
00:00:58,317 --> 00:00:59,084
THIS IS BECOMING PRESIDENT TERMS

40
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:02,521
FOR PUBLICAN PARTY THAT IS TALK

41
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,390
TO PEOPLE AND YOU SEE IT IN THE

42
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,325
POLL NUMBERS, RESULTS OF

43
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:07,393
PRIMARIES, THE PRESIDENT IS

44
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:08,761
RESHAPING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

45
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:09,328
IN HIS OWN IMAGE.

46
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:10,829
I THINK THE BIG QUESTION AND I

47
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:12,097
SAY THIS AS A REPUBLICAN IS

48
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:14,333
WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE IN A

49
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,567
POST-TRUMP WORLD.

50
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,936
IT IS THIS COALITION OF THE

51
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:18,871
PRESIDENT HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER

52
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,105
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LONGTIME

53
00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:20,773
REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO SOME

54
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:24,143
BLUE-COLLAR DEMOCRATS, IS THAT

55
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:25,511
GOING TO STAY STABLE AND

56
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:26,478
TOGETHER OR ARE WE GOING TO SEE

57
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,114
A SCHISM IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

58
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:30,716
BETWEEN THE TRUMP FACTION AND

59
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,750
THEY NEVER TRUMP ONCE THE

60
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,484
PRESIDENT HAS LEFT OFFICE,

61
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:34,720
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION.

62
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,654
>> Harris: 'S OTHER HANDING

63
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:36,255
SOME CANDY OVER TO THE

64
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:37,289
REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW.

65
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:40,893
THERE POPULATE POPULARITY, THEIR

66
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:44,196
EDGE HAS SLID.

67
00:01:44,196 --> 00:01:48,333
>> Trish: AND NOT DOING THEM

68
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,102
ANY FAVORS.

69
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:52,237
TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT AGAIN,

70
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,273
NANCY PELOSI ONCE AGAIN TALKING

71
00:01:54,273 --> 00:01:56,341
ABOUT TAXES GOING UP AND THE

72
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,509
TRUTH IS FOR THE BLUE-COLLAR

73
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,012
DEMOCRATS, HE WAS ABLE TO BRING

74
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:00,946
IN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA COME

75
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:03,449
HE'S GOT A REAL SHOT AT BRINGING

76
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:04,750
THEM INTO CONSISTENTLY.

77
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,818
THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE THE

78
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:09,755
REPUBLICAN PARTY ITSELF DOES NOT

79
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,957
FULLY EMBRACE AS PRESIDENT.

80
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:14,927
SO DID THEY START TO MOVE OVER

81
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,528
TO THE ELITE GROUP OF THE LEFT?

82
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:18,330
THAT'S WHAT I FIND FASCINATING

83
00:02:18,330 --> 00:00:00,000
HERE AND I THINK IT HAS THE
