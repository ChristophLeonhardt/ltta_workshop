1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:01,201
REASONABLE PEOPLE WOULD SAY, 

2
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,103
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO BE GONE. 

3
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,471
YOU TO BE OUT OF HERE. 

4
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,106
>> ROSENSTEIN SAYS THAT'S NOT 

5
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:06,706
THE CASE. 

6
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:08,374
>> HE DENIES IT. 

7
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:11,244
>> THE PRESIDENT, AS THE CHIEF 

8
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:18,785
EXECUTIVE CERTAINLY HAS THE 

9
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:19,886
RIGHT TO FIRE ROD ROSENSTEIN, 

10
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:25,058
PARTICULARLY IF HE CAN FIRE HIM 

11
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,225
FOR CAUSE. 

12
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:29,362
IF IN FACT HE DID SAY HE WAS 

13
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,296
CONSIDERING TAPING THE 

14
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,031
PRESIDENT, AND IT WAS NOT 

15
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,466
SOMETHING SAID IN JEST, WHICH 

16
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,268
BY THE WAY, EVEN SAID IN JEST, 

17
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,103
THAT'S A FOOLISH THING TO DO, 

18
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,404
THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IS 

19
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:42,575
THAT IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR 

20
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,612
CAUSE, AND NOW BEFORE WE GO TOO 

21
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,047
FAR AFIELD, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER 

22
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,082
THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN MAY BE 

23
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:52,018
WALKING OVER TO THE WHITE HOUSE 

24
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:56,890
AND NOT NECESSARILY GOING INTO  

25
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,290
ACTUALLY RESIGN. 

26
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,393
WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET. 

27
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,928
AXIOS HAS REPORTED IT, BUT WE 

28
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,329
DON'T KNOW IT'S YET CONFIRMED. 

29
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,364
WE WILL WAIT AND SEE. 

30
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:07,400
PAULA REID IS WORKING ON IT 

31
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,068
RIGHT NOW, AND THE REALITY, 

32
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,403
TOO, REMEMBER, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

33
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,571
IS RIGHT NOW, DOWN THE STREET 

34
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,506
FROM WHERE WE ARE. 

35
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,908
HE IS IN NEW YORK. 

36
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:17,377
SO, IF ROD ROSENSTEIN IS GOING 

37
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,512
OVER TO THE WHITE HOUSE, I 

38
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:22,582
ASSUME HE'S GOING OVER TO SPEAK 

39
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,150
WITH JOHN KELLY AS THE CHIEF OF 

40
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,920
STAFF, AND A LOT OF TIMES, 

41
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,188
THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS, BUT 

42
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,689
ULTIMATELY WHY WOULDN'T ROD 

43
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,424
ROSENSTEIN WAIT TO BE FIRED? 

44
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:31,824
WHY RESIGN? 

45
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,359
>> YOU KNOW, THE OTHER THING -- 

46
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,128
>> WHAT IS THE TOONS THAT 

47
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:35,395
QUESTION? 

48
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,864
>> I DON'T HAVE THE FAINTEST 

49
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:38,064
IDEA. 

50
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:46,906
I WOULD WAIT TO BE FIRED, BUT 

51
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,408
JUST LIKE PREEK WAS THE ONE 

52
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,376
U.S. ATTORNEY WHO SAID COME AND 

53
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:50,843
GET ME. 

54
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:52,311
>> I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION 

55
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:57,050
PEOPLE WILL HAVE, HOW OFTEN 

56
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,219
DOES THE PRESIDENT SAY THE NEW 

57
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,887
YORK TIMES IS FAKE, PHONY 

58
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:01,954
SOURCES, AND IT'S NOT TRUTHFUL, 

59
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,856
YET IF HE'S GOING BY THE 

60
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:04,924
REPORTING IN THE NEW YORK TIMES 

61
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,526
THAT RECOMMENDS ITSELF TO THE 

62
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:07,827
IDEA THAT THE MEDIA AND THE 

63
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:11,531
PRESS IS ONLY VIABLE TO THE 

64
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,999
ADMINISTRATION WHEN IT SUITS 

65
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:13,399
ITS INTEREST. 

66
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,903
IF IT DOESN'T, IT'S FAKE NEWS. 

67
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,037
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL 

68
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,440
DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS, HE SAYS 

69
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,575
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, AND THEN, WHY 

70
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,943
WOULD THE PRESIDENT, IN THIS 

71
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:24,777
PARTICULAR CASE, BELIEVE THE 

72
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,513
NEW YORK TIMES, AND IN ALL THE 

73
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,548
OTHER INSTANCES OF THE NEW YORK 

74
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:32,151
TIMES REPORTING SAY FAKE NEWS? 

75
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:35,454
>> WHAT A RATIONAL ASSESSMENT, 

76
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:35,654
VLAD. 

77
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:37,690
THE REALITY IS THAT THOSE OF 

78
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,891
US, PERHAPS INCLUDING THE 

79
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:42,495
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 

80
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,865
WHO DECIDE TO READ ALL OF WHAT 

81
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,133
A NEWS REPORT OR ARTICLE SAYS 

82
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,534
BELIEVING NONE OF IT, ALL OF 

83
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,303
IT, OR SOME OF IT. 

84
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,472
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, IT 

85
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,373
CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE THE 

86
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,675
INITIAL STORY FROM THE NEW YORK 

87
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,911
TIMES HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BY 

88
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:00,680
VERY MANY OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS, 

89
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,482
BUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU SAY 

90
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,783
SOMETHING IN JEST, OR WHETHER 

91
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,952
OR NOT YOU WERE SERIOUS, AND 

92
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,656
THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISPUTE 

93
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,724
AMONGST THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, 

94
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:12,959
ABOUT WHAT ROD ROSENSTEIN 

95
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,494
ACTUALLY SAID AND WHAT HE MEANT 

96
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,262
WHEN HE SAID IT, AND KEEP IN 

97
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,731
MIND THE PERSON WHO WROTE THE 

98
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:24,570
MEMO ABOUT WHAT WAS SAID IN THE 

99
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,337
ROOM WAS ANDREW McCABE. 

100
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:26,806
HE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN LET 

101
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,841
GO, AND HE'S UNDER 

102
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,309
INVESTIGATION. 

103
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,512
YOU A LOT OF THINGS UNDERNEATH 

104
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,613
THIS, AND THE DIFFICULTY, I 

105
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,249
THINK, THAT PEOPLE FEEL IS 

106
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:36,983
THIS. 

107
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:43,056
IF YOU'RE ROD ROSENSTEIN, WOULD 

108
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,691
YOU AVOID THE CONSTITUTION 

109
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,392
CRISIS BY GOING FORWARD AND 

110
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,860
RESIGNING, CREATE THE 

111
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,360
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS? 

112
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,298
I SAY THAT IN QUOTES, BY MAKING 

113
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,499
THE PRESIDENT FIRE YOU WHEN THE 

114
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,335
PRESIDENT HAS THE RIGHT TO FIRE 

115
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,902
YOU FOR CAUSE. 

116
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:58,237
WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE FALLOUT, 

117
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,772
WHAT MANY PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED 

118
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,774
ABOUT IS THE INVESTIGATION OF 

119
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,077
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT 

120
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,011
MUELLER, IF ROBERT ROSENSTEIN 

121
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,546
GOES, DOES THAT MEAN MUELLER IS 

122
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,614
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK AND THE 

123
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:10,116
INVESTIGATION WILL CLOSE DOWN? 

124
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,218
THAT'S FIVE STEPS DOWN THE 

125
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,854
ROAD, AND SOMEONE ELSE WOULD BE 

126
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,255
PUT IN ROD ROSENSTEIN'S PLACE, 

127
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,624
AND THAT PERSON WOULD CERTAINLY 

128
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:21,127
HAVE THE RIGHT TO LET ROBERT 

129
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:21,560
MUELLER FINISH HIS 

130
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,929
INVESTIGATION, AND ONE WOULD 

131
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,564
THINK IT WOULD BE DONE FAIRLY 

132
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:24,764
SOON. 

133
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,666
I THINK THE ONLY END POINT WE 

134
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,935
CAN LOOK AT RIGHT NOW, IT IS 

135
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,137
SAID THAT MICHAEL FLYNN WILL 

136
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,572
GET SENTENCED ON DECEMBER 18, 

137
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,174
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE 

138
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,309
MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS AT 

139
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,477
LEAST OPEN UNTIL DECEMBER 18th, 

140
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:43,249
AND THAT'S A LONG TIME FROM 

141
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:43,750
NOW. 

142
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,017
>> RIGHT. 

143
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,952
>> SO IF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 

144
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:50,056
GENERAL IS FIRED OR IF HE 

145
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,524
RESIGNS, WHO, THEN, BECOMES 

146
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,760
RESPONSIBLE FOR ROBERT MUELLER, 

147
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,628
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 

148
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,062
INVESTIGATION? 

149
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,931
>> AS I UNDERSTAND IT, AND I 

150
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,466
WILL CONTINUE TO RESEARCH IT. 

151
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,801
AS I UNDERSTAND, THERE'S NO 

152
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,935
DIRECT LINE OF SUCCESSION THAT 

153
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,238
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO FOLLOW 

154
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:05,838
HERE. 

155
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,239
I THINK THAT BECAUSE ATTORNEY 

156
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,307
GENERAL SESSIONS HAS RECUSED 

157
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:08,574
HIMSELF. 

158
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,576
>> THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE, 

159
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:10,809
RIGHT? 

160
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,678
>> WE SHOULD POINT OUT TO OUR 

161
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:12,978
VIEWERS. 

162
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,881
THE REASON WHY THE DEPUTY A.G. 

163
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,216
IS IN CHARGE, NORMALLY IT'S THE 

164
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:17,616
ATTORNEY GENERAL. 

165
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:18,784
>> NO QUESTION. 

166
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:20,987
>> AND BECAUSE JEFF SESSIONS 

167
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:29,729
RECUSED HIMSELF, IT FELL INTO 

168
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,129
ROSENSTEIN'S LAP? 

169
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:30,996
>> EXACTLY. 

170
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:35,168
NORMALLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 

171
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,101
IS LOOKING TO APPOINT DEPUTIES. 

172
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:39,105
I DON'T WANT TO HOLD FAST UNTIL 

173
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,273
I RESEARCH THOROUGHLY, BUT THE 

174
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,275
PRESIDENT DOES HAVE A RIGHT TO 

175
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,342
APPOINT SOMEONE TO BE IN THE 

176
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,211
POSITION AS I UNDERSTAND IT. 

177
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:49,215
IF THAT IS, IN DEED, CORRECT, 

178
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,116
THERE'S A MYRIAD OF CHOICES 

179
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:50,316
HERE. 

180
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,384
>> DOES THE PERSON APPOINTED 

181
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,287
HAVE TO BE PART OF THE JUSTICE 

182
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:54,587
DEPARTMENT. 

183
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,923
>> WHAT I READ QUICKLY ON MY 

184
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,458
WAY FLYING DOWN THE STAIRS 

185
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,395
HERE, IS THAT THE PERSON MUST 

186
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,663
HAVE ALREADY BEEN CONFIRMED. 

187
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,096
>> WHOA. 

188
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:06,032
>> SO THERE'S A WHOLE GROUP OF 

189
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,867
PEOPLE WHO FALL INTO THAT 

190
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,134
CATEGORY. 

191
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,235
AS WE CONTINUE, I WILL CONTINUE 

192
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,270
TO RESEARCH, AND AT THE SAME 

193
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,505
TIME, PAULA REID IS GOING OFF 

194
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,539
TO DO A SPECIAL REPORT THAT 

195
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,608
WILL BE ON THE AIR, AND SHE IS 

196
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,943
PROBABLY GOING TO RESEARCH THIS 

197
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:17,443
HAS WELL. 

198
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,346
>> I MEAN, YOU KNOW, AND THIS 

199
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,482
IS ALL AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF 

200
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,951
WHAT IS PLAYING OUT IN THE 

201
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,886
UNITED STATES SENATE, WITH THE 

202
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,920
PRESIDENT, AND YOU HEARD 

203
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,054
EARLIER THIS MORNING, AND 

204
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:31,557
MAKING HIS WAY TO THE U.N. 

205
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,725
GENERAL ASSEMBLY, STICKING HARD 

206
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,694
AND FAST WITH HIS NOMINEE FOR 

207
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,728
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. 

208
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,863
IT'S ALL PLAYING OUT AGAINST 

209
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:40,166
THAT AND THE FACT YOU HAVE, YOU 

210
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,200
KNOW, EVERY WORLD LEADER HERE 

211
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,236
IN NEW YORK CITY FOR A SERIES 

212
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:45,471
OF MEETINGS AT THE UNITED 

213
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,373
NATIONS, AND THERE'S A LOT 

214
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,642
GOING ON, AND IT'S HARD, TO ME, 

215
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,744
AND AGAIN, AS SOMEONE WHO IS 

216
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,412
NOT IN POLITICS, IF YOU'RE JUST 

217
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,847
THE AVERAGE PERSON ON THE 

218
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,349
STREET, YOU'RE WATCHING WHAT IS 

219
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,351
HAPPENING HERE, AND YOU'RE 

220
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,919
SAYING, EVEN IF THE PRESIDENT 

221
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,888
IS JUSTIFIED IN GETTING RID OF 

222
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:02,955
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, IS 

223
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,157
THIS THE RIGHT TIME TO DO IT? 

224
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:09,562
>> WELL, THAT IS A REALLY GOOD 

225
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,231
QUESTION BECAUSE OF THE LOOMING 

226
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,101
MIDTERMS, AND SO IS THIS THE 

227
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:15,601
RIGHT TIME? 

228
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,969
>>> IS SAYING, LOOK, SESSIONS 

229
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,838
COULD BE IN TROUBLE AFTER THE 

230
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,706
MIDTERMS, DEPENDING HOW IT ALL 

231
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:21,741
PLAYS OUT, AND YOU WOULD ASSUME 

232
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,809
IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS ON 

233
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:25,545
THE CHOPPING BLOCK, PERHAPS THE 

234
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,913
DEPUTY A.G., AND THE PRESIDENT 

235
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,548
JUST CLEANS HOUSE AFTER THE 

236
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:28,815
MIDTERMS. 

237
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,516
WHY MAKE THE MOVE NOW? 

238
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:39,292
>> THAT MAY BE A VERY TRUE 

239
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,395
STATEMENT, BUT, IF IT'S BROUGHT 

240
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,597
ABOUT BY ROD ROSENSTEIN WALKING 

241
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,098
TO THE WHITE H■OUSE, IF IT'S 

242
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:46,932
THOUGHT BECAUSE HE'S WALK 

243
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:47,967
TOGETHER WHITE HOUSE, IN FACT 

244
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,768
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE 

245
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,904
CHIEF OF STAFF, JOHN KELLY, 

246
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,406
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF 

247
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,640
RESIGNATION, RATHER THAN THE 

248
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,509
FACT OF RESIGNATION, THIS IS A 

249
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,945
FACTOR THAT OF ALL PEOPLE, JOHN 

250
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,514
KELLY HAS TO TAKE INTO 

251
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,749
CONSIDERATION IN A CALCULUS, 

252
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,085
AND IT'S IRONIC, ISN'T IT, OR 

253
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,855
IS IT BY DESIGN THAT ROD 

254
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,724
ROSENSTEIN WOULD WAKE UP ON 

255
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:12,758
MONDAY MORNING, MAKING THE TREK 

256
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,295
TO TALK TO JOHN KELLY F THAT  

257
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,664
-- IF THAT IS WHAT IS 

258
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,465
HAPPENING, WHEN THE PRESIDENT 

259
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,635
IS ENGAGED IN THE U.N. GENERAL 

260
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:22,902
ASSEMBLY. 

261
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:23,836
IN THE WORLD OF FOREIGN POLICY, 

262
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,371
WE HAVE TO WATCH WHAT THE 

263
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,173
PRESIDENT IS ULTIMATELY GOING 

264
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,975
TO SAY TO THE LEADERS OF THE 

265
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:29,775
OTHER FOREIGN NATIONS. 

266
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,611
IT'S AN ODD TIME, OR IS IT? 

267
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:33,312
>> PERHAPS NOT. 

268
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,648
>> WE HEARD THAT THE PRESIDENT, 

269
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,817
DESPITE HIS SORT OF SIGNATURE 

270
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:38,851
LINE, YOU'RE FIRED FROM HIS 

271
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,486
SHOW, IN FACT DOES NOT LIKE 

272
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,888
FIRING PEOPLE, SO WHY NOT GET 

273
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,390
SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT WHILE 

274
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,959
YOU'RE OUT OF TOWN? 

275
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,392
THAT'S SIMPLISTIC. 

276
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:48,661
>> BUT WHEN YOU STARTED WITH ME 

277
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:53,299
WHEN I TOOK THE CHAIR JUST NOW 

278
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,601
IS REALLY THE VERY IMPORTANT 

279
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,001
CONSIDERATION. 

280
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,035
IF YOU HAVE THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 

281
00:08:57,035 --> 00:09:00,139
GENERAL, WHETHER OR NOT HE'S IN 

282
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,240
CHARGE OF THE INVESTIGATION, 

283
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,608
IT'S A POWERFUL POSITION, AND 

284
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:06,045
IF HE WAS IN FACT TALKING ABOUT 

285
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:10,049
THE 25th AMENDMENT, LET ALONE 

286
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,119
THE FACT OF TAPING THE 

287
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,120
PRESIDENT, THAT CERTAINLY GIVES 

288
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,222
REASON TO SAY IT'S FOR CAUSE. 

289
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,225
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN 

290
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,092
ROSENSTEIN SAYING TO McCABE, 

291
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:30,069
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, WEAR 

292
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,971
A WIRE. 

293
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:39,545
THAT'S VERY SARCASTIC. 

294
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,913
HE HAS A QUIRKY PERSONALITY, 

295
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,982
AND IT WOULD NOT BE UNHEARD OF 

296
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,316
IN HOW HE INTERACTS WITH 

297
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:46,619
PEOPLE, BUT IT'S A DANGEROUS 

298
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,119
THING TO DO. 

299
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:51,257
>> SO THERE'S AN INTERVIEW THAT 

300
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,625
THE PRESIDENT DID WITH HERALDO 

301
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,827
RIVERA OF FOX NEWS, AND HE 

302
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,262
ASKED THE PRESIDENT ABOUT ROD 

303
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,496
ROSENSTEIN AND THE REPORTING IN 

304
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,199
THE NEW YORK TIMES, AND THE 

305
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,068
PRESIDENT BASICALLY SORT OF 

306
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:09,108
DIDN'T GIVE AWAY HIS CARDS, AND 

307
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,476
HE ESSENTIALLY SAID HE HASN'T 

308
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,344
HEARD EVERYTHING YET, HE'S 

309
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:14,280
WEIGHING WHAT TO DO, AND HE 

310
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,682
POINTS OUT HE WAS HIRED BY JEFF 

311
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,418
SESSIONS, AND JEFF SESSIONS 

312
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:19,885
RECUSED HIMSELF. 

313
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,921
HE'S BEEN ACTIVE ON TWITTER, 

314
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,055
AND HE CALLED OUT ROSENSTEIN 

315
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,359
AND OTHERS, HE CALLS OUT A LOT 

316
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,493
OF PEOPLE ON TWITTER, AND 

317
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,594
SOMETIMES NOTHING HAPPENS 

318
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,130
BECAUSE OF THE TWEETS HE 

319
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,397
LAUNCHES. 

320
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,966
AS YOU SAID, RIKKI, WE DON'T 

321
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,166
KNOW. 

322
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,501
WE ARE SPECULATING IF HE'S 

323
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,837
RESIGNING, WILL BE FIRED OR THE 

324
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,872
COMBINATION OF YOU'RE FIRED, 

325
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:40,939
AND YOU CAN'T FIRE ME, BECAUSE 

326
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:41,307
I QUIT. 

327
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,309
>> JUST READING WHAT THE 

328
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,543
PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY IN 

329
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,945
RESPONSE TO THE ARTICLE, IT'S 

330
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,580
VAGUE, BUT HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, 

331
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,417
WELL, I THINK IT'S A VERY SAD 

332
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,752
STORY, AND PEOPLE ARE OBVIOUSLY 

333
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,352
LOOKING INTO THE IT. 

334
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:57,623
IT'S VERY SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS 

335
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:57,890
 

336
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,123
HAPPEN. 

337
00:10:58,123 --> 00:11:00,493
SO, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE 

338
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,029
STORY OR THE CONTENT OF THE 

339
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:04,463
STORY. 

340
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,131
THAT'S HIM ACKNOWLEDGING HE 

341
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,233
BELIEVES THE CONTENT OF THE 

342
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:07,832
STORY IS TRUTHFUL. 

343
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:08,968
>> ALSO, THE PRESIDENT'S USUAL 

344
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:14,006
WORDS ARE, WE WILL SEE WHAT 

345
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,273
HAPPENS. 

346
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,775
>> THAT IS HIS FAVORITE CLOSING 

347
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:16,075
LINE. 

348
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,443
>> AGAIN, LOOK, WE ARE STILL 

349
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,845
TRYING TO LOCK THIS DOWN, AND 

350
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,314
WE ARE GOING TO KNOW VERY, VERY 

351
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,015
SOON. 

352
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,383
AS WE HAVE BEEN SAYING, THE 

353
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:24,984
DEPUTY A.G. 

354
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,652
IS ON HIS WAY TO THE WHITE 

355
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:26,885
HOUSE. 

356
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:28,087
WHILE WE ARE SORT OF TRYING TO 

357
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,389
NAIL THIS DOWN, LET'S TALK A 

358
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,091
LITTLE THE BIT ABOUT THIS BRETT 

359
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:32,958
KAVANAUGH NOMINEE SITUATION, 

360
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,426
AND IT IS PLAYING OUT AGAINST 

361
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:36,228
ALL OF THE BACKDROP OF WHAT WE 

362
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,465
ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE, AND CAN 

363
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,635
WE, YOU KNOW, CAN -- JUST, WITH 

364
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,703
YOUR EXPERIENCE, RIKKI, DO YOU 

365
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,973
THINK THE HEARING IS GOING TO 

366
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,609
HAPPEN ON THURSDAY? 

367
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:53,212
>> AS THE PRESENT SECOND, YES, 

368
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,414
BUT ASK ME AT 3:00 OR 4:00. 

369
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,049
THE KAVANAUGH SITUATION RIGHT 

370
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,517
NOW IS FOUGHT WITH PERIL. 

371
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,687
THERE'S A SECOND ACCUSER, AND 

372
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,255
MICHAEL AVENATTI SAYS HE HAS A 

373
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:07,726
THIRD ACCUSER, AND HE WILL 

374
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:08,093
ANNOUNCE THAT. 

375
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,095
MICHAEL AVENATTI AS HE PUTS IT 

376
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,598
AND PUT IT ON TWITTER, ONCE 

377
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:13,398
AGAIN, HE DOESN'T BLUFF. 

378
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:14,700
>> WE SAID THAT EARLIER, WE 

379
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,702
KNOW HE LIKES TO BE ON 

380
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,604
TELEVISION, AND HE'S ON THE AIR 

381
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,639
HERE QUITE OFTEN AS WELL AS 

382
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,674
OTHER PEOPLE'S BROADCASTS, BUT 

383
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,210
HE'S NEVER NOT PRODUCED WHAT HE 

384
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:24,810
SAYS HE HAS. 

385
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,378
>> ABSOLUTELY CORRECT, AND WE 

386
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,048
KNOW THAT HE HAS A THIRD 

387
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:29,315
ACCUSER. 

388
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,549
WE DON'T KNOW THE 

389
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,518
CIRCUMSTANCES, EXCEPT THAT IT 

390
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,452
WAS, AGAIN, WHEN BRETT 

391
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,820
KAVANAUGH WAS YOUNG. 

392
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,822
WHETHER HE WAS A TEENAGER OR IN 

393
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,657
COLLEGE, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY, 

394
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:43,662
BUT IN THAT YOUTHFUL TIME, AND 

395
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,632
THE DIFFICULTY IS THIS. 

396
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,067
THIS HAS TO WEIGH HEAVILY NOT 

397
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,202
ONLY ON BRETT KAVANAUGH, BUT IT 

398
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,504
ALSO HAS TO WEAR HEAVILY ON 

399
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,438
DONALD TRUMP AND THE WHITE 

400
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,006
HOUSE, AND PEOPLE WHO ARE IN 

401
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,909
CHARGE OF GOING FORWARD AND 

402
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,279
HELPING BRETT KAVANAUGH THROUGH 

403
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,747
THE HEARINGS, AND THERE COMES A 

404
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:05,050
POINT WHERE SOMEBODY HAS TO 

405
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,419
MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF IF IT'S 

406
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,954
WORTH ALL OF THIS. 

407
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,858
THERE'S A LIST THAT THE FEDERAL 

408
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,126
SOCIETY, A CONSERVATIVE GROUP 

409
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,296
PUT TOGETHER FOR PRESIDENT 

410
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:25,004
DONALD TRUMP, OF MANY, MANY 

411
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,071
WELL-QUALIFIED WHO ARE 

412
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:26,438
CONSERVATIVES. 

413
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,339
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO START AGAIN 

414
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,173
FOR A SEARCH. 

415
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:30,709
HE HAS THE NAMES FOR A SEARCH. 

416
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,912
HE HAS TALKED TO PEOPLE AT THE 

417
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:33,979
TIME OF THE NEIL GORSUCH 

418
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,514
NOMINATION, AND AGAIN AT THE 

419
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,516
TIME OF THE KAVANAUGH 

420
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,719
NOMINATION, AND THERE ARE OTHER 

421
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,989
PEOPLE THAT HE COULD QUICKLY 

422
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,891
PUT INTO BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 

423
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,294
CHOOSES AND HAVE THEM GO FORTH 

424
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,662
AS A NOMINEE. 

425
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:51,597
NOW, WHAT THIS CREATES, 

426
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,632
OBVIOUSLY, IS THE PROBLEM THAT 

427
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:57,670
IF THERE IS A NEW NOMINEE, 

428
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,972
THEN, DO YOU KNOW -- HOW LONG 

429
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,274
DOES THE CLOCK GET STALLED? 

430
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,343
MANY OF THE PERSPECTIVE 

431
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,979
NOMINEES, IN FACT, IF NOT ALL, 

432
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,247
ARE ALREADY JUDGES ON UNITED 

433
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,416
STATES COURTS WHO HAVE GONE 

434
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,050
THROUGH CONFIRMATION HEARINGS, 

435
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,585
AND ALL THEIR FILE HAS TO DO IS 

436
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:13,985
BE UPDATED. 

437
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:20,125
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE TO START 

438
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:20,926
FROM SCRATCH HERE. 

439
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:21,693
THE DEMOCRAT-REPUBLICAN 

440
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:22,795
DILEMMA, THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO 

441
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,229
DELAY UNTIL AFTER THE NOVEMBER 

442
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,063
ELECTIONS, AND THE REPUBLICANS 

443
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:26,966
WOULD LIKE TO MARCH FORWARD, 

444
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:32,371
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE 

445
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,039
REPUBLICANS MARCHING FORWARD, 

446
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,541
MITCH McCONNELL HAS BEEN 

447
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,476
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR, HE WANTS THE 

448
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:41,313
VOTE, AND THAT IS, WILL THIS 

449
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:45,217
PERSON, THIS JUSTICE, BE 

450
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:51,590
TAINTED FOREVER MORE AS THE -- 

451
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,925
POSSIBLE, THAT'S POSSIBLE, 

452
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,527
ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULTER AND 

453
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,796
SOMEONE WHO HAD, YOU KNOW, AN 

454
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,431
INAPPROPRIATE BACKGROUND WHEN 

455
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:05,838
THEY WERE A TEENAGER, EVEN 

456
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:13,979
THOUGH THEY HAVE HAD DECADES OF 

457
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:14,246
SERVICE. 

458
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,981
CLARENCE THOMAS HAS BEEN ON THE 

459
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,385
COURT ALL THE TIME, AND FOR 

460
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,086
MANY PEOPLE,ESPECIALLY OF A 

461
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,188
CONSERVATIVE BACKGROUND, THEY 

462
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,157
FEEL HE IS A VERY, VERY 

463
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:25,891
EFFECTIVE JURIST. 

464
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,661
>> WHAT HE DID HAVE WAS AN FBI 

465
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:30,796
INVESTIGATION INTO THE 

466
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:31,129
ACCUSATIONS. 

467
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:32,898
>> VERY, VERY FAIR ENOUGH. 

468
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,234
>> IT'S DIFFERENT TIMES, AND WE 

469
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,535
ARE HYPERSENSITIVE TO HOW 

470
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,704
POLITICAL THINGS HAVE GOTTEN, 

471
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,941
AND YOU KNOW, JUST READING SORT 

472
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,609
OF THE PORTION OF THE HERALDO 

473
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,411
INTERVIEW, AND THE PRESIDENT IS 

474
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,079
ASKED, AND HE ASSERTS SUPPORT 

475
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,480
FOR KAVANAUGH, BUT HE SAYS DR. 

476
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,849
FORD WILL HAVE TIME TO TELL HER 

477
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,985
STORY, AND HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, 

478
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,687
WE WILL LISTEN TO BRETT, AND WE 

479
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,121
WILL LISTEN TO DR. FORD, AND HE 

480
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,690
SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE THE 

481
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,326
WAY YOU HAVE TO VOTE AS A 

482
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,093
REPUBLICAN AND AS A DEMOCRAT, 

483
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,861
AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THAT 

484
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:03,896
PORTION OF THE INTERVIEW, BUT 

485
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,032
THAT'S THE OTHER THING THAT IS 

486
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:11,437
GOING TO BE FOLLOWING HIM, IF 

487
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,938
HE BECOMES A SUPREME COURT 

488
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,640
JUSTICE, THAT PART OF IT IS IT 

489
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,274
DIDN'T MATTER WHAT CAME UP. 

490
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:17,910
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WILL 

491
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,245
ONLY VOTE A CERTAIN WAY BECAUSE 

492
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,947
IT'S VERY POLITICALLY CHARGED 

493
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:22,180
TIMES. 

494
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,217
>> TELL THAT TO SENATOR 

495
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,552
COLLINS, AND TELL THAT TO THE 

496
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,788
SENATORS THIS IS A VERY THIN 

497
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:36,128
MAJORITY IN THE SENATE AT THIS 

498
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:36,995
POINT IN TIME. 

499
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,998
WHETHER YOU HAVE -- ONE OF THE 

500
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,368
THINGS AS I HAVE ASSESSED, 

501
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,002
SPEND YEARS PROSECUTING 

502
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,069
SEXUALLY ASSAULT CASES AND SENT 

503
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,039
ON THE BOARD OF THE RAPE 

504
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,474
TREATMENT CENTER OF UCLA LOS 

505
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,910
ANGELES FOR 7 YEARS, IS THAT 

506
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,645
WHEN DR. FORD FROM NEWS 

507
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,081
ACCOUNTS, BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT 

508
00:16:56,081 --> 00:17:00,419
HEARD HER, DR. FORD SOUNDS 

509
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,121
LIKE, TO ME, A CREDIBLE 

510
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,522
INDIVIDUAL, AND SHE CERTAINLY 

511
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:06,290
BELIEVES EVERYTHING SHE SAYS IS 

512
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,895
TRUE, THAT SHE HAS PASSED A 

513
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,296
POLYGRAPH FROM A FORMER FBI 

514
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:14,700
EXAMINER, AND THAT THERE ARE 

515
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,402
THINGS IN HER LIFE THAT 

516
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:18,203
CORROBORATE HER STORY, HER 

517
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,439
LEAVING THE EAST COAST FOR THE 

518
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,507
WEST COAST, HER DECIDING TO 

519
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,209
BECOME SOMEONE WHO WORKS WITH 

520
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,044
PEOPLE IN TRAUMA, AND HER 

521
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,311
DIFFICULTIES IN EXPRESSING ALL 

522
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:30,582
OF THIS, AND HER DECIDING TO 

523
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,684
TELL HER HUSBAND AND THE 

524
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,853
THERAPIST IN 2012, LONG BEFORE, 

525
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,389
AND THIS IS DURING OBAMA'S 

526
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:37,656
TIME. 

527
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,958
LONG BEFORE BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS 

528
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:44,563
A NAME THAT EVER CAME OUT TO 

529
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:44,996
THE PUBLIC. 

530
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:47,699
YOU A LOT EVEN THOUGH NO ONE 

531
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,434
ELSE WAS IN THE ROOM EXCEPT 

532
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:50,302
MARK JUDGE, WHO IS NOT 

533
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,269
TESTIFYING BECAUSE THE SENATE 

534
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:52,571
DECIDED NOT TO CALL HIM, THE 

535
00:17:52,571 --> 00:18:01,046
THIRD GUY IN THE ROOM, AND EVEN 

536
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,247
THAT IS CREDIBILITY THAT SHE 

537
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,118
NAMES A THIRD PERSON IN THE 

538
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:06,318
ROOM. 

539
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,653
YOU A POTENTIALLY CREDIBLE 

540
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:07,886
STORY. 

541
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:08,987
SHE COULD FALL APART ON 

542
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,589
THURSDAY IF THERE'S A STORY, 

543
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,424
BUT NOW YOU WONDER, WHY AREN'T 

544
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,025
THERE MORE? 

545
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,660
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION A LOT OF 

546
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,661
PEOPLE ARE HAVING. 

547
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,128

MANY ARE WONDERING IF IT EVER

WILL. 

572
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:28,920

FIRED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

593
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:23,775
CBS NEWS HAS NOT CONFIRMED 

594
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,243
THIS, BUT A SOURCE SAYS 

595
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,411
ROSENSTEIN, AS POINTED OUT, IS 

596
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,079
ON HIS WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE

>> WHERE WE EXPECT HIM TO WALK 

601
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,620
IN WHEN HE ARRIVES.

CBS NEWS HE IS HEADED TO THE 

609
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:57,943
WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. 

610
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:07,385
>> WE HAVE RIKKI KLIEMAN, AND 

611
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,886
CAITLYN HUEY BURNS. 

612
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:11,323
AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE 

613
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,124
DISTINCTION BETWEEN RESIGNING 

614
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:13,992
AND BEING FIRED. 

615
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:17,996
>> IT'S A DISTINCTION WE KEEP A 

616
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,130
CLOSE EYE ON. 

617
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,899
IF ROSENSTEIN RESIGNS THAT WILL 

618
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,100
LET THE PRESIDENT APPOINT 

619
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,135
SOMEONE TO FILL THE POSITION. 

620
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:27,005
IF HE'S FIRED, IT'S OUR 

621
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,573
UNDERSTANDING THE NATURAL 

622
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,674
SUCCESSION PROCESS TAKES PLACE. 

623
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,243
THAT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE, 

624
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:31,876
REMEMBER, THE PRESIDENT DOES 

625
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,945
NOT LIKE THIS INVESTIGATION TO 

626
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,380
SAY THE LEAST, AND THERE HAVE 

627
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,217
BEEN MANY QUESTIONS IF HE WOULD 

628
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:42,487
SESSIONS IN ORDER TO END THE 

629
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,055
MUELLER PROBE, AND FIRING 

630
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,691
ROSENSTEIN COULD SET THAT INTO 

631
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:47,893
EFFECT BECAUSE ROSENSTEIN, OF 

632
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,661
COURSE, OVERSEES THE MULLER 

633
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,130
PROBE, AND THERE'S A QUESTION 

634
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,099
IF HE WOULD APPOINT SOMEONE IN 

635
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,101
THERE TO DO HIS BIDDING AS IT 

636
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,335
RELATES TO THE INVESTIGATION. 

637
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,370
ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE, AFTER 

638
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,605
WE FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLY IS 

639
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,807
GOING ON HERE, IF ROSENSTEIN IS 

640
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:04,075
OUT, WHAT IT PROMPTS LAWMAKERS 

641
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,678
IN CONGRESS TO DO IN THE 

642
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:07,345
SENATE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE 

643
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,314
LEADING UP TO ALL OF THIS, WE 

644
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:15,387
HAVE HAD A LOT OF CONCERNS FROM 

645
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,522
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ABOUT, YOU 

646
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,157
KNOW, PROTECTING THE MUELLER 

647
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,158
PROBE, AND NOTHING HAS 

648
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,894
PROTECTED THE LEGISLATION ON 

649
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:26,031
THE FLOOR AND BUILD IT INTO THE 

650
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:26,665
PROTECTION HERE, GIVEN 

651
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,867
LAWMAKERS SAID IT WOULD NEVER 

652
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:29,267
HAPPEN. 

653
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:29,867
DIFFERENT DYNAMICS GOING ON 

654
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:33,104
HERE, THE REPORTING IS STILL 

655
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,307
GOING ON, AND THOSE THINGS TO 

656
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:35,607
CONSIDER. 

657
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,542
>> ALL OF THIS HAPPENING WITH 

658
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,175
THE LOOMING MIDTERM ELECTIONS, 

659
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:41,813
AND YOU HAVE TO WONDER HOW IT 

660
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,214
WILL PROCEED, A FIRING OR 

661
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:43,547
RESIGNATION. 

662
00:24:43,547 --> 00:24:45,083
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE 

663
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:49,221
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VOCAL WHEN 

664
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,522
IT COMES TO CRITICIZING ROD 

665
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,389
ROSENSTEIN, AND ANYONE KEEPING 

666
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,391
TRACK OF IT, YOU KNOW THE 

667
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,059
PRESIDENT, THAT'S NOT HIS 

668
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:54,626
FAVORITE GUY. 

669
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:59,364
>> YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESING 

670
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,198
ABOUT THIS, WE HAVE BEEN 

671
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:03,501
TALKING IN THE NEWS ROOM, WHAT 

672
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:07,639
IS THE STRATEGY IS AND 

673
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,473
REMEMBER, THEY ARE IN THE 

674
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,175
MIDDLE OF THE KAVANAUGH BATTLE. 

675
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:12,611
THE QUESTION THEY RAISED WAS 

676
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,746
RELATED TO THE MULLER PROBE, IN 

677
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,482
SO FAR AS GIVING LIGHT TO 

678
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,249
KAVANAUGH'S PAST STATEMENTS IN 

679
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:24,889
THAT HE SAID A PRESIDENT UNDER 

680
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:26,091
INVESTIGATIONCOULD NOT BE 

681
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:26,591
CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED. 

682
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,726
THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT MONTHS 

683
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,027
AGO WHEN HE WAS FIRST 

684
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,295
ANNOUNCED, AND BRINGING THIS 

685
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:33,999
ALL TO A POINT HERE, RAISING SO 

686
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,133
MANY QUESTIONS, IF, IN FACT, 

687
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,403
HE'S ON HIS WAY OUT, WHY NOW? 

688
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,172
WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE SUPREME 

689
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:41,405
COURT. 

690
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:43,341
>> RIKKI, YOU ARE LOOKING AT 

691
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,542
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? 

692
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,945
>> IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION, 

693
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:49,547
THE SOLICITOR TAKES OVER. 

694
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,749
>> NOAH FRANCISCO, AND HIS 

695
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,318
POLITICS ARE VERY MUCH IN LINE 

696
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,185
WITH DONALD TRUMP'S, HOWEVER, 

697
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,088
DONALD TRUMP, AND THIS IS WHAT 

698
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,091
I'M READING, HE MAY BE ABLE TO 

699
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,092
APPOINT A TEMPORARY REPLACEMENT 

700
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:04,262
TO ROD ROSENSTEIN ON AN ACTING 

701
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:07,899
BASIS FOR UP TO 210 DAYS, SO 

702
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,467
THAT PERSON, AS I THOUGHT 

703
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,137
BEFORE, THEY HAVE TO HAVE 

704
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,371
PREVIOUSLY PASSED A SENATE 

705
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,173
CONFIRMATION FOR ANOTHER POST, 

706
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:19,344
OR BE A SENIOR OFFICIAL FROM A 

707
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,645
RELEVANT DEPARTMENT, AND SO THE 

708
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:24,482
PRESIDENT IS IN THE SEAT EITHER 

709
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:24,682
WAY. 

710

THAT ROSENSTEIN IS EXPECTED TO 

723

GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE AT SOME 

724
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,776
POINT, FOR MEETING WITH VARIOUS 

725

733
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,859

PREPOSITIONED ON THAT ENTRANCE 

745
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,313
TO CATCH PEOPLE WHO VISIT, 

746
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,248
ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE TRYING 

747
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,050
TO DO SO DISCREETLY, BUT AS OF 

748
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,753
YET, OUR TEAM HERE HAS NOT SEEN 

749
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:35,186
ROSENSTEIN ENTER. 

750
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,888
THAT DOES NOT MEAN HE'S NOT 

751
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:37,088
HERE. 

752
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,057
THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO GET IN. 

753
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:42,527
THE REPORTING HE'S ON HIS WAY 

754
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,195

755
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:44,395

WHETHER HE IS RESIGNING OR 

757
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,731
TELLING THEM THEY NEED TO FIRE 

758
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,333

WAS QUITTING OR BEING FIRED 

767
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,449
THIS IS A FAR MORE GRAVE 

768
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,383
SITUATION, OF COURSE, AND I CAN 

769
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:10,221

YEAR. 

775
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,533
ROSENSTEIN OVERSEES THE SPECIAL 

776
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,101
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION, AND 

777
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,202
THERE'S BEEN CONCERN WITH

SUPPORTED BY DEMOCRATS AND 

786
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,884
REPUBLICANS, MOSTLY IN THE 

787
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,152
SENATE, AND IT WOULD IN ESSENCE 

788
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,387
PUT IN PROTECTIONS FOR THE 

789
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:43,854
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 

790
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:48,960
MANY HAVE SAID WE SHOULD DO IT 

791
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,662
NOW IN ADVANCE OF ANY POTENTIAL 

792
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,930
UPENDING, AND OTHERS SAID IT 

793
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,398
WILL NOT BE NECESSARY, AND 

794
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,633
MAYBE WE WILL DO IT IF THE 

795
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,335
PRESIDENT MAKES LINE CHANGES AT 

796
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,036

WE ARE MONITORING THIS TO WAIT 

805
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,749

WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 

811
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,996
HOW IT WILL TRANSPIRE.

TO THE CBS CHIEF OF STAFF. 

815

WE HAVE NOT FIRMED  THAT UP, SO 

816
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,709
WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS IN 

817
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:39,877
REPORTING THAT. 

818
00:29:39,877 --> 00:29:45,116

ABOUT IT, AND HE SAID, I THINK 

831
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,106
IT'S A VERY SAD STORY, AND 

832
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,073
PEOPLE ARE OBVIOUSLY LOOKING 

833
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,075

00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,445

00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,078
SERVING IN THE POSITION, 

914
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:00,912
CONCEIVABLY FALLING TO HIM 

915
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,914
UNLESS THEY TRY TO PUT 

916
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:07,618
SOMETHING ELSE IN CHARGE. 

917
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,620
>> SO, I ASKED EARLIER, DOES 

918
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,488
THE PERSON WHO IS APPOINTED 

919
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,157
HAVE TO BE PART OF THE JUSTICE 

920
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:13,624
DEPARTMENT. 

921
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:21,999
COULD THE PRESIDENT, COULD HE 

922
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:25,169
SORT OF PICK SOMEONE FROM 

923
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:25,435
ANYWHERE? 

924
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:26,938
>> THE UNITED STATES FOR 

925
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:27,205
EXAMPLE? 

926
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,206
>> LIKE ONE OF HIS PALS. 

927
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,241
>> TO GAME THIS OUT, THERE'S 

928
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:34,979
REPORTING THAT THE PRESIDENT, 

929
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,747
AT SOME POINT, WILL, YOU KNOW, 

930
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:38,349
IT'S SPECULATION, BUT IT'S BEEN 

931
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,517
REPORTED THAT AFTER THE MIDTERM 

932
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,785
ELECTIONS, HE MAY DECIDE TO GET 

933
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,119
RID OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 

934
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:44,021
IF YOU KNOW THERE'S PEOPLE, AND 

935
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,890
IT'S ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT 

936
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,291
PEOPLE ARE ANGLING TO BE THE 

937
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:52,630
NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND SOME 

938
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,499
OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY 

939
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:55,299
UNITED STATES SENATORS. 

940
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,001
COULD A UNITED STATES SENATOR 

941
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:57,735
BE THE DEPUTY A.G. 

942
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,070
AND WAIT FOR THE MOMENT WHEN 

943
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,771
THE PRESIDENT GETS RID OF THE 

944
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:01,205
A.G.? 

945
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,540
>> Reporter: THEY COULD BE, BUT 

946
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,108
IF THEY COULD BE CONFIRMED 

947
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,377
BEFORE THE END OF THE CALENDAR 

948
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,478
YEAR OR IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 

949
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:10,648
LOOKING SENATE NEXT YEAR AFTER 

950
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,181
THE ELECTIONS, THAT'S UNCLEAR. 

951
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:13,384
I THINK THIS REPORTING, THIS 

952
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,552
MOMENT, IT COMES A THE A TRICKY 

953
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,388
TIME FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, AND 

954
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,389
YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE'S BEEN 

955
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,424
PLENTY OF CHATTER ABOUT JEFF 

956
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,925
SESSIONS GOING AT THE TOP OF 

957
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:21,958
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE 

958
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:25,596
POSSIBILITY OF HAVING TO FIND 

959
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,598
SOMEONE ELSE, AND IF ROSENSTEIN 

960
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:31,369
GOES, TOO, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE 

961
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,070
TO CREATE A LEADERSHIP VACUUM, 

962
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,273
AND WHO COULD THAT BE WHEN THE 

963
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,440
SENATE IS DIVIDED AND IF IT 

964
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,846
FLIPS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE NARROW 

965
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:42,847
CONTROL, THAT REMAINS 

966
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:43,147
UNCERTAIN. 

967
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:43,748
IT CREATES CONSTERNATION FOR 

968
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,650
FOLKS, NOT JUST DOWN THE 

969
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,684
STREET, BUT HERE ON CAPITOL 

970
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,085
HILL AND AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

971
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,387
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT 

972
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,422
JUST FOCUSED ON THE SPECIAL 

973
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,424
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION, IT'S ALL 

974
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,393
SORTS OF MATTERS, AND A REAL 

975
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,695
VACUUM AT THE TOP, CREATING 

976
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:58,462
PROBLEMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 

977
00:34:58,462 --> 00:34:59,964
>> AND JUST TO REMIND EVERYBODY 

978
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,033
OF WHAT IS GOING ON, WHY YOU 

979
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,302
ARE SEEING THE SHOT OF A 

980
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,271
PARKING LOT HERE, AND WE ARE 

981
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,172
EXPECTING ROD ROSENSTEIN TO 

982
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,241
COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND IT 

983
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,342
LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS VIDEO 

984
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,044
EARLIER, HE GOT INTO A CAR, 

985
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:17,148
HEADED THAT WAY, AND THE 

986
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,150
REPORTING IS, INITIALLY FROM 

987
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,719
AXIOS, HE, ACCORDING TO THEIR 

988
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,120
REPORTING, NOT CBS REPORTING, 

989
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,889
CBS HAS NOT CONFIRMED THIS. 

990
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,891
HE OFFERED TO RESIGN TO THE 

991
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:30,995
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF, AND 

992
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:34,131
THAT HE IS GOING TO THE WHITE 

993
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:36,534
HOUSE NOW, PRESUMABLY TO 

994
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,501
DISCUSS SOMETHING ALONG THOSE 

995
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:38,736
LINES, WHETHER HE IS GOING TO 

996
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,939
BE FIRED OR WHETHER HE IS GOING 

997
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:42,873
TO OFFER OFFICIALLY HIS 

998
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:43,908
RESIGNATION, WE DON'T KNOW, BUT 

999
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,810
WE KNOW HE IS GOING TO THE 

1000
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,143
WHITE HOUSE. 

1001
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:46,977
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT THERE. 

1002
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:48,279
THE PRESIDENT IS IN NEW YORK 

1003
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,581
CITY AT THE UNITED STATES, AND 

1004
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:54,318
PRESUMABLY HE WOULD BE TALKING 

1005
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:54,785
 

1006
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,287
STAFF, AND THE QUESTION SORT OF 

1007
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,089
MOVING FORWARD IS, IF HE IS 

1008
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,624
REMOVED, WHAT DOES THAT -- MANY 

1009
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,592
QUESTIONS WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR 

1010
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,293
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. 

1011
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,828
>> WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY? 

1012
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,430
>> ONE PERSON WHO HAS A POINT 

1013
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,399
OF VIEW ABOUT THAT, ANDREW 

1014
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,100
McCABE. 

1015
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,034
HE JUST RELEASED A STATEMENT, 

1016
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,236
YOU ASKED WHAT HAPPENED TO THE 

1017
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,604
RUSSIA PROBE, AND HE SAID IN A 

1018
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,306
STATEMENT, THERE IS NOTHING 

1019
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,174
MORE IMPORTANT TO THE INTEGRITY 

1020
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:18,676
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE RULE 

1021
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,910
OF LAW PROTECTING THE 

1022
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:24,382
INVESTIGATION OF THE SPECIAL 

1023
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,950
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER. 

1024
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,551
I SACRIFICED PERSONALLY AND 

1025
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:28,218
PROFESSIONALLY AND SUBSEQUENTLY 

1026
00:36:28,218 --> 00:36:30,488
MADE EVERY EFFORT TO PROTECT 

1027
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:30,688
IT. 

1028
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:34,292
TO BE CLEAR, I HAD NO ROLE IN 

1029
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,559
PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION IN 

1030
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:38,296
ANY KIND TO THE MEDIA FOLLOWING 

1031
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,064
DIRECTOR COMEY'S FIRING, IF THE 

1032
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,601
RUMORS OF THE DEPUTY A.G.'S 

1033
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,403
DEPARTURE ARE TRUE, I'M DEEPLY 

1034
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:46,937
CONCERNED IT PUTS THE 

1035
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:49,840
INVESTIGATION AT RISK, AND SO, 

1036
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,242
TO ED'S POINT, CAITLYN, YOU 

1037
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,577
HAVE COVERED POLITICS FOR A 

1038
00:36:53,577 --> 00:37:02,186
LONG TIME, AND RIKKI IS ALSO 

1039
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:02,386
HERE. 

1040
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,022
GIVEN WHERE NOAH FRANCISCO IS, 

1041
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:05,990
WOULD THIS PUT THE 

1042
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,291
INVESTIGATION AT RISK IF 

1043
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,993
FRANCISCO IS THE DEPUTY A.G.? 

1044
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,595
>> THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION, AND 

1045
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:11,862
LET'S TAKE A STEP AND REMEMBER 

1046
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,531
WHY WE ARE IN THIS PLACE, 

1047
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,533
WONDERING WHAT IS GOING ON HERE 

1048
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:21,372
WITH ROSENSTEIN AND THE NEW 

1049
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:25,576
YORK TIMES REPORTED ON FRIDAY, 

1050
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,211
HE SPOKE ABOUT ENVOKING 25th 

1051
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:27,745
AMENDMENT AGAINST THE 

1052
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,646
PRESIDENT, SPOKE ABOUT WEARING 

1053
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,881
A WIRE WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND 

1054
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,084
THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 

1055
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,785
REPORTING AND ALSO THE 

1056
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,454
WASHINGTON POST REPORTING IF HE 

1057
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,855
WAS BEING SARCASTIC IN THE 

1058
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,390
CONVERSATIONS, AND IF THE 

1059
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,993
INFORMATION WAS COMING FROM THE 

1060
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:45,429
MEMOS RELEASED AND WRITTEN BY 

1061
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:45,896
ANDREW McCABE. 

1062
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,898
THAT'S JUST TIEING ALL THE 

1063
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,133
POINTS TOGETHER HERE. 

1064
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,401
POLITICALLY SPEAKING, THE 

1065
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,370
QUESTION OF THE MUELLER PROBE 

1066
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,305
IS FRONT AND CENTER OF THE 

1067
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,272
CAMPAIGN IN THE ELECTION 

1068
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,507
PROCESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE 

1069
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,844
STARTED TO HEAR A LOT FROM 

1070
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,612
REPUBLICANS ENVOKING THE 

1071
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,145
PRESIDENT'S OWN LANGUAGE 

1072
00:38:02,145 --> 00:38:04,047
RELATED TO THE MUELLER PROBE. 

1073
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:06,183
YOU HAVE HEARD THE REPUBLICAN 

1074
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,352
CANDIDATES CALLING IT A WITCH 

1075
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:08,585
HUNT. 

1076
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:09,954
THERE'S A SMALL GROUP IN THE 

1077
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,689
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE 

1078
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,191
PRESIDENT'S SIDE, AND THEY HAVE 

1079
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,794
TRIED TO FILE LETTERS TO 

1080
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,395
IMPEACH ROD ROSENSTEIN. 

1081
00:38:18,395 --> 00:38:20,598
THE PRESIDENT DOES HAVE SOME 

1082
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,234
SUPPORT AMONG THE REPUBLICANS 

1083
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:23,434
HERE. 

1084
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,668
THE DEMOCRATS, OF COURSE, HAVE 

1085
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:25,736
RAISED THE CONCERN OVER AND 

1086
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,004
OVER AGAIN, AND THEY CALLED FOR 

1087
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,439
LEGISLATION TO BE BROUGHT TO 

1088
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:33,677
THE FLOOR TO BE VOTEED ON TO 

1089
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:35,046
ADD LEGAL PROTECTION FOR THE 

1090
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,480
MUELLER PROBE.  

1091
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,016
A LOT OF MOVING PARTS HERE, 

1092
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,051
CERTAINLY, BUT WE ARE JUST 5 OR 

1093

MIKE POMPEO SAID IT WAS A 

1125
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,254
LUDICROUS QUESTION TO ASK HIM 

1126
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:53,257

REMOVING PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM 

1142
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,326

THE REST OF THE WORLD TO

00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:35,059
COOPERATE IN THE U.S. PLANS, 

1170
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,995

00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,230
TWO MEMBERS OF HIS CABINET, 

1172
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:45,269
MOMENTS AGO, SAYING THE 

1173
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,704
DISCUSSIONS, ENVOKING THE 25th 

1174
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,072
AMENDMENT ARE LUDICROUS, AND 

1175
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,373
THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE NOT 

1176
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:49,706
TAKEN PLACE. 

1177
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:52,243
>> YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT, 

1178
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,644
ERROL, AT THE U.N., IT WOULD 

1179
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,145
HAVE BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO 

1180
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,780
TALK ABOUT THE SUCCESSES HE HAS 

1181
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,415
HAD, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO MAKE 

1182
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,618
OF WHAT IS GOING ON WITH NORTH 

1183
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,852
KOREA, AND CERTAINLY BETWEEN 

1184
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:06,323
NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA, 

1185
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:10,027
THERE IS PROGRESS, AND SORT OF 

1186
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,395
IN THE SHADOWS, KAVANAUGH'S 

1187
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:14,098
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS, AND YOU 

1188
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,432
KNOW IT'S BECOMING A MESS, AND 

1189
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,401
IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE 

1190
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,302
PRESIDENT TO LOOK PRESIDETIAL 

1191
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,770
IN FRONT OF OTHER WORLD 

1192
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:23,607
LEADERS, AND NOW, ONCE AGAIN, 

1193
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,009
WE ARE DISTRACTED TWOFOLD. 

1194
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,376
BY THE BRETT KAVANAUGH HEARING, 

1195
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,612
AND THIS BOMB SHELL THAT ROD 

1196
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:32,282
ROSENSTEIN IS HEADED TO THE 

1197
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:33,317
WHITE HOUSE, AND YOU KNOW, 

1198
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,818
CAITLIN, I WANT TO ASK YOU WHAT 

1199
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:35,953
DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? 

1200
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:38,455
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD DAY 

1201
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:39,489
FOR THE PRESIDENT. 

1202
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:40,424
>> IT'S SIGNIFICANT HE'S NOT 

1203
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,392
THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1204
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:43,360
IF HE'S HAVING CONVERSATIONS 

1205
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,962
WITH JOHN KELLY, AND IF HE'S 

1206
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,964
GOING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS 

1207
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,199
WITH JOHN KELLY, AND WHAT THE 

1208
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:49,833
PRESIDENT'S CONVERSATIONS WITH 

1209
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,468
JOHN KELLY HAVE BEEN, AND YOU 

1210
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,871
KNOW, THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN, 

1211
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,473
AND ALSO, WE HAVE TO CONSIDER, 

1212
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:59,476
TOO, THAT, THERE WERE A LOT OF 

1213
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,612
QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT ROD 

1214
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,713
ROSENSTEIN AFTER THE REPORTING 

1215
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,748
ABOUT KIND OF, YOU KNOW, THESE 

1216
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,583
CLAIMS WILL HE HAD MADE, WOULD 

1217
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,585
HE BE, YOU KNOW, CALLED INTO 

1218
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:09,954
CONGRESS TO HAVE TO TESTIFY IN 

1219
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:10,820
FRONT OF CONGRESS? 

1220
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,890
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE A LOT OF 

1221
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,091
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE WHO 

1222
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,059
CERTAINLY WOULD WANT TO HEAR 

1223
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,627
FROM HIM AFTER THE NEW YORK 

1224
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,328
TIMES REPORTING, AND YOU SAW A 

1225
00:43:18,328 --> 00:43:19,663
LOT OF THE PRESIDENT'S ALLIES 

1226
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,766
SEIZING ON THE REPORTING, AND 

1227
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,235
WE WERE WONDERING KIND OF WHAT 

1228
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,604
WOULD IT PROMPT THE PRESIDENT 

1229
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:27,904
TO DO? 

1230
00:43:27,904 --> 00:43:29,073
WE HEARD FROM THE FOX NEWS 

1231
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,708
CABLE HOST WHO IS CLOSE WITH 

1232
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:31,842
THE PRESIDENT, HAS THE 

1233
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,343
PRESIDENT'S EAR, AND HE'S 

1234
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:35,746
CONSIDERED AN INFORMAL ADVISER 

1235
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,749
TO HIM, SAYING HE SHOULD NOT 

1236
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:41,785
FIRE ROD ROSENSTEIN, AND THAT'S 

1237
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,118
SIGNIFICANT. 

1238
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:43,420
THAT SEEMED TO SIGNAL THE 

1239
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,287
POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF DOING 

1240
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:45,989
THAT WOULD BE STARK, EVEN FOR 

1241
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:48,358
THE PRESIDENT'S DEFENDERS HERE. 

1242
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:52,763
A LOT OF ONGOING QUESTIONS. 

1243
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:53,130
>> DEFINITELY. 

1244
00:43:53,130 --> 00:44:02,573
>> I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THE IDEA 

1245
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:03,841
OF NOAH FRANCISCO, I KEEP GOING 

1246
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,777
BACK TO THAT IF THE IDEA IS TO 

1247
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:14,051
GET RID OF ROSENSTEIN TO WRAP 

1248
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,085
UP THE INVESTIGATION, SEAN 

1249
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,720
HENNEDY'S POINT, DON'T DO THIS. 

1250
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,821
IT'S A TRAP. 

1251
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,691
IT GIVES YOUR ENEMIES THE 

1252
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,860
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY, YOU'RE 

1253
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,529
TRYING TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE, AND 

1254
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:25,929
THAT'S PERILOUS. 

1255
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,531
>> IT CERTAINLY COULD BE 

1256
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:30,734
PERILOUS IF THERE WERE NO 

1257
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:30,967
CAUSE. 

1258
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:33,570
QUOTE, END QUOTE CAUSE, TO FIRE 

1259
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:33,937
ROD ROSENSTEIN. 

1260
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:36,740
>> YOU KNOW, BUT BEFORE MIKE 

1261
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,543
POMPEO, YOU KNOW, WHO IS THE 

1262
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,745
SECRETARY OF STATE, REX 

1263
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:46,784
TELLERSON, WAS QUOTED BY  -- 

1264
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:47,951
TILLERSON WAS QUOTED CALLING 

1265
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,119
THE PRESIDENT A MORON. 

1266
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,188
IF CAUSE IS JUST TALKING ABOUT 

1267
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,489
DOING SOMETHING, IS THAT 

1268
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:52,722
ENOUGH? 

1269
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:54,958
>> IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE ENOUGH, 

1270
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:59,163
BUT THE REALITY IS THIS, LET'S 

1271
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:02,599
ASSUME, FOR THE SAKE OF 

1272
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:03,634
ARGUMENT, THAT FRANCISCO, 

1273
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,069
SHOULD IT ALL COME TO PASS, 

1274
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:07,704
WINDS UP ASSUMING THE ROLE, 

1275
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,606
IT'S NOW SEPTEMBER 24th, AND 

1276
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:17,014
THE MIDTERMS ARE IN THE 

1277
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,147
BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER. 

1278
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:19,783
DOES ANYONE SITTING IN HIS 

1279
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:27,324
PLACE WANT TO  BE ON THIS IN 

1280
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,358
THE EVE OF THE MIDTERMS? 

1281
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,392
THE ANSWER IS NO. 

1282
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:30,560
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT. 

1283
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,196
>> REGARDLES OF HOW HE FEELS 

1284
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,398
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION OR HOW 

1285
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,933
THE PRESIDENT FEELS ABOUT IT, 

1286
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:44,174
WHAT THE WORDS THAT HAVE BEEN 

1287
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,343
USED IS IF McCABE GOES, 

1288
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:46,843
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS. 

1289
00:45:46,843 --> 00:45:48,978
WHAT DOES CONGRESS DO? 

1290
00:45:48,978 --> 00:45:51,515
YOU POINTED OUT, CAITLYN, 

1291
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,450
THERE'S LEGISLATION CRAFTED TO 

1292
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,185
PROTECT THE SPECIAL COUNCIL. 

1293
00:45:56,185 --> 00:46:02,859
>> YOU MEANT  ROBERT MUELLER? 

1294
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:03,927
>> SORRY. 

1295
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,629
WHAT DID I SAY. 

1296
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:05,929
>> McCABE. 

1297
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,363
HE'S ALREADY GONE. 

1298
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:08,465
>>> THE SENATE WAS SUPPOSED TO 

1299
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:09,533
BE A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR 

1300
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:10,701
REPUBLICANS, JUST LOOKING AT 

1301
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,703
THE MAP AND WHERE THE 

1302
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,671
COMPETITIVE RACES ARE, AND IF 

1303
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,340
SOMETHING HAPPENS WITH 

1304
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,074
ROSENSTEIN, DOES THAT THROW 

1305
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,343
MORE RACES IN FLUX, AND PERHAPS 

1306
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,044
THE DEMOCRATS COULD INCREASE 

1307
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:24,915
THEIR NUMBERS, AND THE 

1308
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,550
PRESIDENT IS VERY -- HIS 

1309
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:27,918
STRATEGISTS SAY HE SHOULD BE 

1310
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:28,886
CONCERNED ABOUT THE MIDTERMS, 

1311
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,755
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF HIS PARTY 

1312
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:34,057
AND POWER, BUT THE IDEA OF 

1313
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:34,591
IMPEACHMENT, POSSIBLE 

1314
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:36,593
IMPEACHMENT, YOU HAVE HEARD THE 

1315
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:37,794
PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT 

1316
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:38,862
IMPEACHMENT, AND THE REPUBLICAN 

1317
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:42,065
CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT THE 

1318
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:42,800
POSSIBILITY OF IMPEACHMENT, 

1319
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,903
TRYING TO BRING UP THE BASE TO 

1320
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,570
SAY IF YOU ELECT DEMOCRATS, 

1321
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,406
THEY WILL MOVE TO IMPEACH THE 

1322
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:49,706
PRESIDENT. 

1323
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:50,374
THAT'S A FACTOR HERE. 

1324
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,342
YOU HEARD FROM A LOT OF THE 

1325
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:53,577
REPUBLICANS HERE, AND ED 

1326
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,712
MENTIONED FOR THE LAST YEAR OR 

1327
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:56,780
SO, REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN 

1328
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,215
RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THE 

1329
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,516
PRESIDENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE 

1330
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:00,651
MUELLER PROBE, AND HE SHOULD 

1331
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,653
JUST LET THEM PLAY OUT, AND YOU 

1332
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,187
HEARD FROM INVESTIGATORS ON THE 

1333
00:47:04,187 --> 00:47:05,289
COMMITTEE, AND REPUBLICANS SAID 

1334
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,857
THE SAME THING, AND THEY ARE 

1335
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,026
VERY AWARE, AND REPUBLICANS IN 

1336
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,261
CONGRESS ARE VERY AWARE OF THE 

1337
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:11,828
STAKES HERE. 

1338
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,131
>> COULD WHOEVER TAKES OVER FOR 

1339
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:20,304
ROD ROSENSTEIN, IF THEY CHOOSE 

1340
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,571
NOT TO RESOLVE THE 

1341
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:24,007
INVESTIGATION, COULD THEY PUT A 

1342
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,375
DEADLINE ON THE INVESTIGATION, 

1343
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,811
AND RIKKI, YOU TALKED ABOUT A 

1344
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:30,047
COUPLE OF THINGS IN THE 

1345
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,081
PIPELINE, SENTENCING, AND YOU 

1346
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,250
KNOW, SORT OF, LIKE THREE 

1347
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:39,356
DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON. 

1348
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,490
>> MICHAEL COHAN. 

1349
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,692
MICHAEL FLYNN IS CERTAINLY 

1350
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,327
UNDER MUELLER'S PROBE, AND THEN 

1351
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:43,594
MANAFORT. 

1352
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:44,761
>> YOU DO HAVE THREE THING IN 

1353
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:47,497
THE MIX, AND YOU ALSO HAVE, I 

1354
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,232
THINK THE SPECTER OF TWO OTHER 

1355
00:47:49,232 --> 00:47:51,735
THINGS, ONE IN CONGRESS AND ONE 

1356
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:52,536
IN MUELLER'S OFFICE. 

1357
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,538
IN THE CONGRESS, FOR HEAVEN 

1358
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,939
SAKE, IT'S SEPTEMBER 2018, AND 

1359
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:58,976
THEY HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THIS 

1360
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:01,244
WHOLE IDEA OF HAVING TO PASS 

1361
00:48:01,244 --> 00:48:02,212
LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THE 

1362
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,480
MUELLER INVESTIGATION OR NOT, 

1363
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,815
AND THEY HAVE NOT DONE THAT 

1364
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,450
BECAUSE OF COURSE IT WAS NOT 

1365
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,618
NECESSARY TO HAVE TO DO THAT. 

1366
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:09,586
MAYBE IT WAS. 

1367
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:10,921
THE OTHER THING, WE DON'T KNOW. 

1368
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,223
NONE OF US KNOW BECAUSE THERE'S 

1369
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:18,662
NEVER A LEAK OUT OF ROBERT 

1370
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:19,629
MUELLER'S OFFICE, AND ROBERT 

1371
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:22,666
MUELLER'S OFFICE, WE DON'T KNOW 

1372
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,701
IF THEY HAVE CRAFTED AN INTERIM 

1373
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,103
REPORT, OR IF THEY LOOKED AT 

1374
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,471
RUSSIAN COLLUSION, AND THEY ARE 

1375
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:28,805
REWORKING THE REPORT AS TIME 

1376
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:31,608
GOES ON, AND SAME THING WITH 

1377
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:32,909
OBSTRUCTION, AND IF THINGS 

1378
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:37,014
START TO GET DICEY, I DON'T 

1379
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,616
EXPECT MUELLER TO HAVE TO 

1380
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,685
SUDDENLY BECOME A SCRIPTER AND 

1381
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:42,152
START FROM SCRATCH. 

1382
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,753
IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. 

1383
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:45,956
YOU ADD TO IT, THE SAME WAY AS 

1384
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,657
I WOULD DO LEGAL RESEARCH. 

1385
00:48:47,657 --> 00:48:50,260
YOU WRITE AS YOU GO, AND YOU 

1386
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,661
ADD TO IT, AND IT'S ALWAYS 

1387
00:48:51,661 --> 00:48:53,030
POSSIBLE THAT UNDER THE GUN, 

1388
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,099
THEY WOULD HAVE TO ISSUE A 

1389
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,536
REPORT FASTER, OR SOONER RATHER 

1390
00:48:59,536 --> 00:48:59,969
THAN LATER. 

1391
00:48:59,969 --> 00:49:01,772
>> WE HAVE JUST SORT OF BEEN 

1392
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,807
HANDED A RESPONSE, AND WE ARE 

1393
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,643
SEEING HOW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 

1394
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,279
RESPONDING IN SORT OF 

1395
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,580
HINDSIGHT, BUT, REPRESENTATIVE 

1396
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,782
GOUTY WAS ON WITH JOHN 

1397
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,383
DICKERSON, AND JOHN ASKED HIM 

1398
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,584
ABOUT THE REPORTING ABOUT THE 

1399
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,586
25th AMENDMENT AND WHAT HE 

1400
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,321
WOULD EXPECT FROM ROD 

1401
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:19,423
ROSENSTEIN AND HE SAID ROD 

1402
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,091
DESERVES THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD, 

1403
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,193
AND I'M SURE AT SOME POINT THE 

1404
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:26,763
PRESIDENT WILL BRING ROD IN AND 

1405
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:27,864
INCOMPETENT, IF YOU FEEL THE 

1406
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,900
NEED TO WEAR A WIRE WHEN YOU'RE 

1407
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,135
TALKING WITH ME, THEN WHY ARE 

1408
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,637
YOU SERVING IN MY 

1409
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,971
ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT GOES 

1410
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,406
BACK TO SORT OF THE HAVING 

1411
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,075
CAUSE TO GET RID OF SOMEBODY, 

1412
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:38,308
RIGHT? 

1413
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,510
>> IT ALSO GOES BACK TO THE 

1414
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,280
FACT THAT YOU'RE ASSUMING OR 

1415
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,681
TREY IS ASSUMING RATIONAL 

1416
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:45,382
CONVERSATION. 

1417
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:45,949
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

1418
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:50,453
>> IN A VERY IRRATIONAL MOMENT. 

1419
00:49:50,453 --> 00:49:53,824
>> THE OTHER THING, THE 

1420
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:57,027
BACKDROP OF THE SUPREME COURT 

1421
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:57,294
NOMINEE. 

1422
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:03,433
WHEN WE USE THE WORDS 

1423
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:04,501
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS, ON ONE 

1424
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,669
HAND YOU NEED BRETT KAVANAUGH 

1425
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,270
TO BE THE NEXT SUPREME COURT. 

1426
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,606
HE'S ON THE RECORD ABOUT HOW HE 

1427
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:10,740
FEELS AROUND INVESTIGATIONS OF 

1428
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,509
THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF 

1429
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,143
THE UNITED STATES, RIGHT? 

1430
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,746
>> YES, BUT THE CENTER OF 

1431
00:50:16,746 --> 00:50:17,881
DEMOCRATS ARGUMENT AGAINST HIM 

1432
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:18,415
GOING INTO THIS. 

1433
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,118
>> RIGHT, BUT ON THE OTHER 

1434
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:27,691
HAND, YOU HAVE VERY SERIOUS 

1435
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:33,797
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE 

1436
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,398
NOMINEE, WHICH IT'S ALWAYS BEEN 

1437
00:50:35,398 --> 00:50:39,336
SAID ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL, 

1438
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:44,074
HE'S NOT GOING TO PUT HIS 

1439
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:45,108
MEMBERS AT RISK IF THE VOTE 

1440
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,544
DOESN'T GO HOW HE EXPECTS IT TO 

1441
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:47,777
GO. 

1442
00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:48,745
>> IT'S QUESTIONING THE MEMBERS 

1443
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:50,280
OF THE SENATE WITH THEIR 

1444
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,581
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 

1445
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:51,881
PRESIDENT. 

1446
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:53,550
MANY DON'T FEEL THE ALLEGIANCE 

1447
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,719
TO HIM, AND THEY ARE RETIRING. 

1448
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:58,488
FLAKE, CORKER, OF COURSE, KEY 

1449
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,023
VOTES, AND ALSO FOCUSING ON 

1450
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,291
COLLINS AND LISA TO SWING THE 

1451
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,660
VOTES IN THE SENATE, AND THE 

1452
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,497
REPUBLICANS ALSO HAPPEN TO BE 

1453
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:08,798
WOMEN, AND WHETHER THE 

1454
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:10,033
PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS IN TERMS OF 

1455
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,301
ROSENSTEIN, AND AGAIN, WE DON'T 

1456
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,003
KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN OR 

1457
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,771
WHAT IS HAPPENING OR WHAT THE 

1458
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,139
CONVERSATIONS ARE, BE CLEAR 

1459
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,642
ABOUT THAT, BUT IF SOMETHING 

1460
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:20,210
DOES, IN FACT, HAPPEN, THAT 

1461
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,745
REMOVES ROSENSTEIN AND RAISES 

1462
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:22,846
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROBE, I'M 

1463
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,514
WONDERING IF THAT WILL ALSO 

1464
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:25,849
BRING UP ADDITIONAL CONCERNS 

1465
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,350
FOR THOSE MEMBERS WHO WERE 

1466
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,485
ALREADY ON THE FENCE ABOUT 

1467
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:31,188
KAVANAUGH, AND KIND OF WHAT IT 

1468
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,622
MEANS, ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY 

1469
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,090
HAVE NOT BEEN EXTREMELY PLEASED 

1470
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,225
WITH THERHETORIC COMING OUT 

1471
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,394
FROM THE PRESIDENT AND HAVE 

1472
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:38,828
CALLED FOR PROTECTIONS FOR THIS 

1473
00:51:38,828 --> 00:51:40,096
PROBE OR JUST TO ALLOW IT TO 

1474
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:40,630
CONTINUE. 

1475
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,900
>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE 

1476
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,969
SWING SENATORS, YEAH, THAT WILL 

1477
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:46,336
BE INTERESTING. 

1478
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:47,337
>>> LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 

1479
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:48,471
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT 

1480
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:50,707
FOR THE BETTER PART OF AN HOUR. 

1481
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:52,509
WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK, 

1482
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,044
COME BACK, REGROUP, AND WE WILL 

1483
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:54,644
HAVE MORE INFORMATION. 

1484
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:55,278
STICK AROUND. 

1485
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,462
>>> ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE A CAMERA 

1486
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:26,629
TRAINED ON THAT ENTRANCE RIGHT 

1487
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:28,298
THERE, AND WE COULD BE WRONG. 

1488
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:29,132
THERE'S A NUMBER OF ENTRANCES 

1489
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,467
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT A 

1490
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,168
NUMBER OF PEOPLE FEEL THIS IS 

1491
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:33,503
WHERE ROD ROSENSTEIN IS GOING 

1492
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:34,937
TO APPEAR AT SOME POINT. 

1493
00:54:34,937 --> 00:54:36,206
WE HAVE A CAMERA THERE, AND 

1494
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:39,442
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THE NEWS 

1495
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:42,345
FIRST REPORTED BY AXIUS, AND 

1496
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:44,547
IT'S BEEN UNCONFIRMED, THE 

1497
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:45,415
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, ROD 

1498
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,317
ROSENSTEIN, IN CHARGE OF THE 

1499
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,485
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION 

1500
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:50,720
INTO THE RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN 

1501
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,856
THE 2016 ELECTION, EXPECTS TO 

1502
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,257
BE FIRED, AND PERHAPS HE 

1503
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:55,925
VERBALLY OR IN SOME WAY 

1504
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,527
COMMUNICATED HE WAS RESIGNING 

1505
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,028
TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF, JOHN 

1506
00:54:59,028 --> 00:55:00,463
KELLY, AND NOW HE'S ON HIS WAY 

1507
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,430
TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1508
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:05,101
THAT'S THE ONLY THING FOR THE 

1509
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:07,070
VIEWERS, THE ONLY THING WE CAN 

1510
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,104
CONFIRM, ROD ROSENSTEIN IS ON 

1511
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:09,472
HIS WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1512
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,108
FOR ALL WE KNOW, HE'S THERE 

1513
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:12,509
ALREADY. 

1514
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,577
MAYBE HE'S NOT. 

1515
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,446
WE DON'T KNOW. 

1516
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:25,989
WE HAVE CAITLI, AND INSIDE HUEW 

1517
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:34,263
BURNS AND R -- WE HAVE CAITLI! 

1518
00:55:34,263 --> 00:55:36,733
HUEY BURNS AND RIKKI KLIEMAN 

1519
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:36,966
HERE. 

1520
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:39,002
YESTERDAY ON FACE THE NATION 

1521
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:46,009
THERE WAS AN INTERVIEW, TALKING 

1522
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,877
ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS MADE ON 

1523
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:49,446
FRIDAY THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 

1524
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:52,816
GENERAL IN THE WAKE OF FIRING 

1525
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:53,783
OF JAMES COMEY MADE THE 

1526
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,084
SUGGESTION HE COULD RECORD THE 

1527
00:55:55,084 --> 00:55:56,953
PRESIDENT OR THAT HE WOULD TRY 

1528
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,722
TO ENGAGE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 

1529
00:55:59,722 --> 00:56:01,624
PRESIDENT'S CABINET IN 

1530
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,460
DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE 25th 

1531
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,928
AMENDMENT, WHICH IS THERE TO 

1532
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:06,830
REMOVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

1533
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,164
UNITED STATES IF THE VICE 

1534
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,200
PRESIDENT AND THE MEMBERS OF 

1535
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,634
THE CABINET FEEL HE CANNOT 

1536
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:12,802
CARRY OUT HIS DUTIES. 

1537
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,437
I JUST LAID OUT WHERE WE ARE 

1538
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:19,442
FOR THE TOP OF THE HOUR FOR OUR 

1539
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:19,709
VIEWERS. 

1540
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,544
>> WE HAVE FRANCO ORDONES, A 

1541
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,979
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT ON 

1542
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:23,613
THE PHONE NOW. 

1543
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:24,948
FRANCO, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 

1544
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:28,084
ABOUT WHAT IT COULD MEAN, 

1545
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:29,953
WHETHER A FIRING, VERSUS A 

1546
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,588
RESIGNATION MAKES A DIFFERENCE, 

1547
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:32,888
AND AS YOU HEAR THE POTENTIAL, 

1548
00:56:32,888 --> 00:56:34,891
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS 

1549
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,660
YOU'RE PONDERING ABOUT WITH 

1550
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,062
WHAT THE FALLOUT MAY BE IF ROD 

1551
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,630
ROSENSTEIN LEAVES OR IS FIRED? 

1552
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,431
>> I THINK THE BIG QUESTION IS, 

1553
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:45,468
WHAT DOES THIS DO TO THE 

1554
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:46,436
MUELLER INVESTIGATION, OF 

1555
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:47,670
COURSE, AND YOU KNOW, 

1556
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,539
ROSENSTEIN HAS BEEN WALKING A 

1557
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:52,642
TIGHT ROPE FOR A LONG TIME, AND 

1558
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:54,411
IT'S BEEN BETWEEN PRESIDENT 

1559
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,680
TRUMP AND THE MUELLER 

1560
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,681
INVESTIGATION, AND MUELLER, 

1561
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,250
AFTER SESSIONS RECUSED HIMSELF, 

1562
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,052
IT WAS MUELLER WHO HAS BEEN 

1563
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,521
OVERSEEING THE MUELLER 

1564
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:05,922
INVESTIGATION INTO QUESTIONS 

1565
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,857
ABOUT RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE AND 

1566
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,492
THE ELECTION, AND RUSSIAN 

1567
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:10,660
INVOLVEMENT WITH THE TRUMP 

1568
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,961
CAMPAIGN, AND AS I SAID, HE'S 

1569
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,363
BEEN KIND OF WALKING THE 

1570
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:16,633
SITUATION WHERE HE HAS TO 

1571
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,502
PROTECT THE INVESTIGATION 

1572
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:20,136
AGAINST TRUMP'S ALLEGATIONS 

1573
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:22,772
THAT IT'S A WITCH HUNT, AND HE 

1574
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,741
HAD TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DEFEND 

1575
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,074
IT TOO MUCH. 

1576
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:28,978
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN THE 

1577
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:29,846
SITUATION WHERE HE IS 

1578
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:30,680
ESSENTIALLY BEING REMOVED FROM 

1579
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,348
HIS POSITION, AND IF THAT'S THE 

1580
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:35,718
CASE, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE ELSE 

1581
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:40,056
WILL COME IN, AND A NEW PERSON 

1582
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,090
COULD ESSENTIALLY REFUSE TO 

1583
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:42,392
APPROVE THE REQUEST, AND IT 

1584
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,293
COULD SLOW DOWN THE 

1585
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,461
INVESTIGATION, BRING IT TO A 

1586
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:47,230
CRAWL, OR WORSE, TRUMP, IN 

1587
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,398
ANOTHER SITUATION, TRUMP COULD 

1588
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,466
OPEN THE DOOR FOR TRUMP GETTING 

1589
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:51,633
RID OF MUELLER HIMSELF. 

1590
00:57:51,633 --> 00:57:53,870
>> YEAH, IN DEED, AND AS YOU 

1591
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,238
TALKED BEFORE, EARLIER, IT'S 

1592
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,373
HAPPENING WITH, YOU KNOW, THE 

1593
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:58,408
MIDTERM ELECTIONS LOOMING, AND 

1594
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:02,378
THERE ARE, SORT OF THINGS THAT 

1595
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,547
COULD HAPPEN, AS PART OF THE 

1596
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:06,349
LINE OF SUCCESSION, PEOPLE CAN 

1597
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,184
TAKE OVER, AND THEN THE 

1598
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,319
PERCEPTION, HOW THE GENERAL 

1599
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:13,289
PUBLIC FEELS ABOUT NOT JUST THE 

1600
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,190
PRESIDENT, BUT OBVIOUSLY 

1601
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,559
CONGRESS AND THE SENATE AND THE 

1602
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,460
OTHER REPUBLICANS, AND WHETHER 

1603
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,063
OR NOT THEY FEEL THERE'S A 

1604
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,532
DELIBERATE ATTEMPT, MAYBE 

1605
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,232
BECAUSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES 

1606
00:58:23,232 --> 00:58:26,102
ALLOWING IT, TO OBSTRUCT 

1607
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:26,435
JUSTICE HERE. 

1608
00:58:26,435 --> 00:58:27,971
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS 

1609
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:28,571
INVESTIGATING THE PRESIDENT. 

1610
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:29,539
>> NO, THERE'S NO QUESTION 

1611
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:30,305
ABOUT IT. 

1612
00:58:30,305 --> 00:58:35,011
I THINK A LOT OF THAT DEPENDS 

1613
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,646
ON WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON. 

1614
00:58:37,646 --> 00:58:40,283
A LOT OF THE FEELINGS IN THE 

1615
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,718
PUBLIC, IT'S POLARIZED RIGHT 

1616
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:43,118
NOW IN THE COUNTRY. 

1617
00:58:43,118 --> 00:58:44,787
IF YOU'RE AN ALLY OF THE 

1618
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,556
PRESIDENT, YOU'RE FEELING THE 

1619
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:47,524
PRESIDENT IS, AGAIN, TAKING 

1620
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:52,195
UNPOPULAR STEPS TO GET RID OF 

1621
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,263
SOMEONE WHO IS ACTIVELY BEEN 

1622
00:58:54,263 --> 00:58:55,198
WORKING AGAINST THE 

1623
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:55,798
ADMINISTRATION, ACTIVELY 

1624
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,535
WORKING AGAINST SOMEONE WHO 

1625
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,135
PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF AS 

1626
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:02,539
QUSTIONED HIS LOYALTY AND IF 

1627
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,472
HE CAN BE QUESTIONED. 

1628
00:59:03,472 --> 00:59:04,707
IF YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OR 

1629
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:05,908
SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN THE 

1630
00:59:05,908 --> 00:59:06,542
MUELLER INVESTIGATION AND FEELS 

1631
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:07,710
IT'S RIGHT, YOU ARE FEELING 

1632
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:12,348
IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE 

1633
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:13,549
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION A BIT 

1634
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:13,849
UNRAVELING. 

1635
00:59:13,849 --> 00:59:15,818
TRUMP AT WAR WITH HIS OWN 

1636
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:17,820
GOVERNMENT, AND IT'S SEEING HOW 

1637
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,288
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS REALLY 

1638
00:59:19,288 --> 00:59:22,091
TAKEN, YOU KNOW, TAKEN IT APART 

1639
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:30,266
AND HURT THE UNITED STATES'  

1640
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,401
BIGGEST INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE 

1641
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,735
FBI AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 

1642
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,770
>> IT'S INTERESTING. 

1643
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,605
AN HOUR INTO THIS, WE ARE IN 

1644
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:38,808
THE NEWS ROOM, AND WE CAN SEE 

1645
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,176
WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING, 

1646
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:41,644
AND IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S A 

1647
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:43,846
SLIGHT PULLBACK ON THE NEWS, 

1648
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:45,248
AND EVERYONE IS SAYING THE 

1649
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,382
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL IS JUST 

1650
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:48,317
ON THE WAY TO MEET WITH THE 

1651
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:49,084
CHIEF OF STAFF. 

1652
00:59:49,084 --> 00:59:51,788
HE'S BEEN SUMMONED TO THE WHITE 

1653
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:52,055
HOUSE. 

1654
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,056
I WONDER YOUR SOURCES, YOU SIT 

1655
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:54,290
IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND YOU 

1656
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,626
TALK TO FOLKS, AND I KNOW SARAH 

1657
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,261
SANDERS IS IN NEW YORK, BUT I 

1658
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,595
DON'T KNOW WHO IS THERE FROM 

1659
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:00,830
THE PRESS OFFICE IN THE WHITE 

1660
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:04,333
HOUSE, BUT WHAT ARE YOU HEARING 

1661
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:04,467
 

1662
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:07,103
WHY ROD ROSENSTEIN IS ON HIS 

1663
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,805
WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE? 

1664
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:11,474
AND WHAT POTENTIALLY IT ALL 

1665
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:11,707
MEANS? 

1666
01:00:11,707 --> 01:00:12,942
>> I MEAN, I THINK SIMILAR TO 

1667
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,343
WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING IN 

1668
01:00:14,343 --> 01:00:15,678
THE PAST, THERE'S SO MUCH 

1669
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,313
UNCLEAR RIGHT NOW, AND WE HAVE 

1670
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,582
HEARD DIFFERENT THINGS, YOU 

1671
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,818
KNOW, HE DELIVERED A MESSAGE TO 

1672
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,953
-- ORALLY TO JOHN KELLY, BUT 

1673
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:24,553
NOW THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT 

1674
01:00:24,553 --> 01:00:26,456
THAT, AND AS YOU POINTED OUT, 

1675
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,024
ALL OF THE CAMERAS ARE NOW, YOU 

1676
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,058
KNOW, EYEING ON THE WHITE 

1677
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:32,028
HOUSE, AND WAITING TO SEE IF HE 

1678
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:33,096
WILL WALK THROUGH THE SCREEN 

1679
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,530
SHOT, AND BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT 

1680
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,767
OF QUESTIONS IF HE IS GOING TO 

1681
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,035
BE FIRED, IF HE IS RESIGNING, 

1682
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:41,237
OR IT'S SOMETHING ELSE. 

1683
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:45,141
WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT, THIS HAS 

1684
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:49,378
BEEN KIND OF COUNTDOWN AS TO 

1685
01:00:49,378 --> 01:00:49,911
WHETHER ROSENSTEIN COULD 

1686
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:51,981
SURVIVE THIS CONTINUED PELTING 

1687
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:52,882
FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, 

1688
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:57,920
AFTER THAT REPORT FROM THE NEW 

1689
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,723
YORK TIMES, SAYING HE 

1690
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,258
POTENTIALLY WAS GOING TO WEAR A 

1691
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:03,826
WIRE, IF HE WAS GOING TO ENVOKE 

1692
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,095
THE 25th AMENDMENT OR NOT. 

1693
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:07,964
WHETHER JUST IN JEST OR JUST 

1694
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,098
FLOATING THE IDEA, THAT 

1695
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:10,399
CERTAINLY STRUCK THE PRESIDENT, 

1696
01:01:10,399 --> 01:01:13,202
AND IT HIT A NERVE THAT, YOU 

1697
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,638
KNOW, ALREADY HAS BEEN VERY 

1698
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,206
SENSITIVE FOR A LONG TIME, SO, 

1699
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:20,143
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SEEN THESE 

1700
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:21,544
THINGS IN THE PAST WHERE 

1701
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:22,779
THERE'S RUMBLES IN THE WHITE 

1702
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,080
HOUSE START, AND OFTEN TIMES 

1703
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,382
THEY END UP WITH A TOP LEADER 

1704
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:30,153
LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

1705
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,788
LEAVING THE ADMINISTRATION. 

1706
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:33,690
>> CAITLIN DO YOU WANT TO SAY 

1707
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:33,990
SOMETHING? 

1708
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,924
>> WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU 

1709
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:36,659
HAVE BEEN HEARING IN TERMS OF 

1710
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:42,799
THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORT THAT 

1711
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,100
WOULD SUGGEST THAT ROSENSTEIN 

1712
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,802
WAS COMPROMISED IN ANY WAY IN 

1713
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:48,237
TERMS OF HIS ABILITY TO OVERSEE 

1714
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:50,306
THE INVESTIGATION GIVEN WHAT 

1715
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:54,710
WAS IN THE REPORTING? 

1716
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:55,043
>> NO. 

1717
01:01:55,043 --> 01:01:56,979
I SAY THAT ON THE BASIS OF 

1718
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,347
BEING A LAWYER. 

1719
01:01:58,347 --> 01:01:59,715
WE ARE LOOKING AT AN 

1720
01:01:59,715 --> 01:02:01,217
INVESTIGATION, AND ACCORDING TO 

1721
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:05,054
LAW, ROBERT MUELLER STILL HAS 

1722
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,656
AN IMPECCABLE REPUTATION FOR 

1723
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:10,827
ETHICS AND INTEGRITY, AND HE IS 

1724
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:12,161
GOING FORWARD TO FIND THE 

1725
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,863
TRUTH, WHEREVER THE TRUTH IS 

1726
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:16,098
AND WHEREVER THE FACTS WILL 

1727
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:16,365
LEAD HIM. 

1728
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:17,066
ROD ROSENSTEIN HAS BEEN 

1729
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,136
OVERSEEING IT, BUT NOT IN THE 

1730
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,772
SENSE OF IN ANY WAY, QUOTE, END 

1731
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:25,474
QUOTE, CORRUPTLY OR WITH 

1732
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:26,876
CORRUPT INTENT OR WITH JUST 

1733
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:29,879
INAPPROPRIATE INTENT IN HIS 

1734
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:31,080
DIRECTION OF ROBERT MULER, AND 

1735
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:31,314
-- 

1736
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,282
>> KEEP IN MIND, THAT'S A GOOD 

1737
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:34,750
POINT YOU MAKE, AND ONE OF THE 

1738
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:40,289
THINGS THAT WAS IN THE NEW YORK 

1739
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:41,123
TIMES REPORT BECAUSE IT'S 

1740
01:02:41,123 --> 01:02:45,127
ALLEGEDLY HAPPENED IN THE WAKE 

1741
01:02:45,127 --> 01:02:47,329
OF FIRING OF JAMES COMEY. 

1742
01:02:47,329 --> 01:02:49,999
ROD ROSENSTEIN WROTE A LETTER 

1743
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:52,335
SAYING THESE ARE THE REASONS 

1744
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:55,171
WHY, AND HE THEN SAID, IT'S 

1745
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,507
BECAUSE OF THE RUSSIAN 

1746
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:57,874
INVESTIGATION. 

1747
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,208
YOU'RE LIKE, YOU JUST PUT ME 

1748
01:02:59,208 --> 01:02:59,808
OUT THERE. 

1749
01:02:59,808 --> 01:03:01,711
>> THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF 

1750
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:03,880
DISTRESS ON THE PART OF ROD 

1751
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,348
ROSENSTEIN, AND FROM MY SOURCES 

1752
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:06,449
IN WASHINGTON, PEOPLE WHO KNOW 

1753
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,251
HIM VERY WELL, AT THAT POINT, 

1754
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:09,952
HE WAS IN A GREAT DEAL OF 

1755
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,821
TURMOIL, AND HE FELT HE WAS 

1756
01:03:12,821 --> 01:03:14,891
MIDDLED, USED, AND HE DID NOT 

1757
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:16,993
INTEND, WHEN HE WROTE THE 

1758
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,694
REPORT TO BECOME THE WHIPPING 

1759
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:25,001
BOY, AND THE RESULTS OF IT, IT 

1760
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,502
WAS THAT HE WINDS UP CALLING 

1761
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:28,938
FOR THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 

1762
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:31,240
INVESTIGATION AND APPOINTING 

1763
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,808
ROBERT MUELLER, WHICH, AS STEVE 

1764
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:36,145
BANNON HAS SAID, IT WAS THE 

1765
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,648
WORST POLITICAL DECISION IN 

1766
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,882
HISTORY IF I'M QUOTING STEVE 

1767
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:42,451
BANNON CORRECTLY, AND IT WAS AT 

1768
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,087
A TIME THAT, IF IN FACT, ROD 

1769
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:46,956
ROSENSTEIN UTTERED ANYTHING IN 

1770
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:48,491
WORDS ABOUT THE 25th AMENDMENT, 

1771
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,060
OR IF HE WAS JOKING, OR SERIOUS 

1772
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,862
ABOUT WEARING A WIRE, AND I 

1773
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,831
HAVE GOT TO ASSUME HE WAS 

1774
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:59,201
JOKING, WHICH WAS INAPPROPRIATE 

1775
01:03:59,201 --> 01:03:59,635
 

1776
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:01,504
AT A TIME THAT EMOTIONS WERE 

1777
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,939
RUN ARING HIGH. 

1778
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:03,806
IT'S A YEAR AGO! 

1779
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:04,774
IT'S MORE THAN THAT. 

1780
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,909
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. 

1781
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:10,780
>> TO YOUR POINT ABOUT HOW HE 

1782
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,814
HAS CONDUCTED HIMSELF WITH THE 

1783
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:13,215
RESPONSIBILITY OF BEING 

1784
01:04:13,215 --> 01:04:15,551
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SPECIAL 

1785
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:16,385
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION, FOR ALL 

1786
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:17,887
EXTENTS AND PURPOSES, WE DON'T 

1787
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:19,956
KNOW, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE HE HAS 

1788
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,325
BEEN INCORRUPTIBLE TO USE YOUR 

1789
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:22,558
WORDS? 

1790
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:23,926
>> I THINK SO, AND NOW 

1791
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,294
REASONABLE MINDS COULD CONSIDER 

1792
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:26,495
BECAUSE IT COULD CERTAINLY BE 

1793
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,564
SAID BY PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE 

1794
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:31,667
DIFFERENTLY THAN I DO THE DATA 

1795
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,102
SAYS HIS SUPERVISION, THEY 

1796
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:36,172
WOULD SAY, WELL, ISN'T IT 

1797
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:40,443
INTERESTING HE DECIDED TO FARM 

1798
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:43,245
OUT THE  COHAN CASE TO THE 

1799
01:04:43,245 --> 01:04:44,613
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 

1800
01:04:44,613 --> 01:04:48,084
WHILE THEY WERE WORKING ON THE 

1801
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:48,451
MANAFORT CASE. 

1802
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:49,752
ISN'T IT INTERESTING FOR ROD 

1803
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:52,088
ROSENSTEIN TO DECIDE TO GO 

1804
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:54,223
AFTER MANAFORT'S ACTIVITIES IN 

1805
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:59,362
LOBBYING AND WORKING FOR THE 

1806
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,430
PRORUSSIAN FEDERATION IN 

1807
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:02,264
UKRAINE YEARS BEFORE. 

1808
01:05:02,264 --> 01:05:03,532
WASN'T IT INTERESTING THERE 

1809
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:05,034
WERE TWO INDICTMENTS FOR PAUL 

1810
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,302
MANAFORT FOR WHAT POSSIBLE 

1811
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:09,205
PURPOSE THAN TO GET MANAFORT TO 

1812
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:09,438
FLIP? 

1813
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:12,742
THERE'S PEOPLE WHO MAY LOOK AT 

1814
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,409
ROD ROSENSTEIN'S CONDUCT HAS 

1815
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,009
PRESSURE, PRESSURE, PRESSURE 

1816
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:15,244
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. 

1817
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,879
I DO NOT LOOK AT IT THAT WAY, 

1818
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,613
BUT THERE'S OTHERS WHO DO. 

1819
01:05:18,613 --> 01:05:21,017
>> THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO ASK 

1820
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:21,384
ED O'KEEFE. 

1821
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:25,788
I WAS ASK THINKING THE SAME  -- 

1822
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:26,956
I WAS THINKING THE SAME LINES 

1823
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:27,690
AS YOU.  

1824
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:31,327
IF THERE WAS A FRACTURE, IT 

1825
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:33,262
STARTED EARLY ON, WITH THE 

1826
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,330
LETTER EXPLAINING WHY JAMES 

1827
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,331
COMEY NEEDED TO BE FIRED. 

1828
01:05:36,331 --> 01:05:38,667
I WONDERED ED, OR ANYONE ELSE, 

1829
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:40,469
IF YOU HAVE ANY FAMILIARITY 

1830
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,171
WITH HOW ROD ROSENSTEIN FELT 

1831
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:43,239
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, FELT ABOUT 

1832
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,140
THE WAY HE WAS BEING TREATED. 

1833
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,243
I MEAN, IT CAN'T BE EASY TO 

1834
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:50,146
HAVE TWEETS GO OUT THERE, AND 

1835
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,648
HE CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE A 

1836
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:53,081
CONSERVATIVE GUY. 

1837
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:54,417
HE'S NOT JUMPING ON TWITTER AND 

1838
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:54,950
RESPONDING IN ANY WAY. 

1839
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,619
>> HE'S BEEN ASKED A FEW TIMES 

1840
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,853
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST 

1841
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:02,525
YEAR AND A HALF OR SO, AND YOU 

1842
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:04,193
KNOW, HAS NOT TIPPED HIS HAT 

1843
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:04,560
EITHER WAY. 

1844
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,729
WE KNOW FROM THE REPORTING DONE 

1845
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:08,064
BY OUR COLLEAGUES HERE, 

1846
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:09,498
OBVIOUSLY HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT 

1847
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:14,203
THIS, AND HE IS FOCUSED ON 

1848
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:16,005
KEEPING THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 

1849
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:24,880
INVESTIGATION, ITSELF, INTACT, 

1850
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,981
AND IN A REPUTABLE STATE. 

1851
01:06:25,981 --> 01:06:26,916
IT SHOWS THINGS ARE DAMAGED, 

1852
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,484
AND WE ARE KEEPING OUR EYE ON 

1853
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,953
THE DRIVEWAY CAMERA HERE, AND 

1854
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:32,154
IT'S NOT THE PRETTIEST SHOT, 

1855
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:35,357
BUT WHAT IT DOES IT GIVES US A 

1856
01:06:35,357 --> 01:06:36,392
NARROW WINDOW AT A STAIRCASE 

1857
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,427
LEADING INTO THE WEST WING, AND 

1858
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,464
PEOPLE WHO ARE SOMETIMES 

1859
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,398
VISITING COME THROUGH THAT 

1860
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:43,866
DOOR, AND ALL WE ARE REALLY 

1861
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:45,868
ABLE TO DO IS READ HALF A FACE 

1862
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:47,570
OR SO OF THE PEOPLE COMING AND 

1863
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,005
GOING, BUT YOU CAN'T PULL BACK 

1864
01:06:50,005 --> 01:06:52,508
FROM THE SHOT OR REALLY PAN 

1865
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,509
EITHER WAY. 

1866
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,444
THAT'S THE NARROW VIEW WE HAVE 

1867
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:56,044
FROM THAT LOCATION. 

1868
01:06:56,044 --> 01:06:57,947
>> THE WHOLE WORLD IS LOOKING A 

1869
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,416
THAT THE VIEW RIGHT NOW. 

1870
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,817
>> CAITLIN, YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU 

1871
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:03,685
WANTED TO JUMP IN BEFORE. 

1872
01:07:03,685 --> 01:07:05,487
>> IT'S INTERESTING. 

1873
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:08,223
YOU SAID, AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY 

1874
01:07:08,223 --> 01:07:08,423
TRUE. 

1875
01:07:08,423 --> 01:07:09,024
FROM MUELLER'S PROSPECTIVE, 

1876
01:07:09,024 --> 01:07:12,128
FROM HIS PART, HE HAS BEEN 

1877
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,863
ABSOLUTELY SILENT, NOT TALKING 

1878
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,197
ABOUT IT AT ALL. 

1879
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,066
ROSENSTEIN HAS TALKED ABOUT IT, 

1880
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,400
GIVEN PUBLIC SPEECHES, OUT IN 

1881
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,135
PUBLIC, TESTIFYING BEFORE 

1882
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:20,269
CONGRESS, AND OF COURSE HE HAS 

1883
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,972
BEEN, BECAUSE HE IS LEADING THE 

1884
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:26,942
INVESTIGATION, OR OVERSEEING 

1885
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:30,646
THE IN-- INVESTIGATION, HE'S úB 

1886
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,081
CONFERENCE, TALKING ABOUT THE 

1887
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:32,948
INDICTMENTS, PUSHING FORWARD BY 

1888
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:33,415
THE D.O.J. 

1889
01:07:33,415 --> 01:07:35,717
AS A RESULT OF THE PROBE. 

1890
01:07:35,717 --> 01:07:37,953
HE HAS, IN ALL APPEARANCES, AT 

1891
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:39,321
LEAST TO ME, EXPRESSED A LEVEL 

1892
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:42,258
OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN 

1893
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:43,826
POSITION AND HIS OWN VIEW OF 

1894
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,594
HOW THE MUELLER PROBE IS GOING. 

1895
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,329
MY QUESTION THAT I WAS RAISING 

1896
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,064
A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO, DOES 

1897
01:07:49,064 --> 01:07:51,734
THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING 

1898
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,736
CHANGE ROSENSTEIN'S OWN VIEW OF 

1899
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,671
HIS EFFECTIVENESS IN THIS? 

1900
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:57,373
>> YOU KNOW, THE OTHER THING 

1901
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,942
THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION, 

1902
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:01,577
AND I ALSO WONDER, AND WE KEEP 

1903
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,712
TALKING ABOUT, WHAT DOES IT 

1904
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:05,548
MEAN FOR THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 

1905
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:07,683
INVESTIGATION IF THE DEPUTY 

1906
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,351
ATTORNEY GENERAL GOES, AND 

1907
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:12,588
RIKKI, TO YOU, THERE'S SO MANY 

1908
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,255
INVESTIGATIONS NOW BEING 

1909
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,858
CONDUCTED, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 

1910
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,426
SOUTHERN DISTRICT CONDUCTING AN 

1911
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,694
INVESTIGATION, AND JUST BECAUSE 

1912
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:21,263
THE PRESIDENT OR ONE OF THE -- 

1913
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:21,997
WHOEVER THE PRESIDENT APPOINTS 

1914
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:25,634
TO TAKE THE SPOT OF THE DEPUTY 

1915
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:25,834
A.G. 

1916
01:08:25,834 --> 01:08:27,069
DECIDES TO SHUTDOWN THE MUELLER 

1917
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:29,037
PROBE, IT DOES NOT MAKE THE 

1918
01:08:29,037 --> 01:08:29,837
INVESTIGATIONS GO AWAY, AND 

1919
01:08:29,837 --> 01:08:32,207
THERE MAY BE MORE FROM THE 

1920
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:33,175
OTHER DISTRICT IN THE UNITED 

1921
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:33,408
STATES. 

1922
01:08:33,408 --> 01:08:35,578
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, FIRST 

1923
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:37,145
OF ALL, WE HAVE TWO THAT ARE 

1924
01:08:37,145 --> 01:08:38,581
DONE WITH IN THE SENSE THAT 

1925
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:40,049
THEY ARE NOT GOING AWAY. 

1926
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,649
>> AND THE PRESIDENT HAS NO 

1927
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:42,585
CONTROL OVER THOSE. 

1928
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:44,553
>> NONE, AND THAT CONCERNS, AND 

1929
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,889
THEY ARE UNDER ROBERT MUELLER, 

1930
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:49,191
BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE, 

1931
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:50,459
BECAUSE, PAUL MANAFORT HAS NOW 

1932
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,228
PLEADED GUILTY, AND HE IS -- 

1933
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,895
THAT'S NOT GOING BACK. 

1934
01:08:53,895 --> 01:08:54,162
>> RIGHT. 

1935
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:56,198
>> AND THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR 

1936
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:57,800
PAUL MANAFORT TO DO, CONTINUE 

1937
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,301
TO COOPERATE, AND THEY HAVE 

1938
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,402
ALREADY DEBRIEFED HIM FOR A 

1939
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:03,839
LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND HE'S 

1940
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,774
GETTING SENTENCED, AND I MEAN, 

1941
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:08,176
I WOULD THINK PAUL MANAFORT HAS 

1942
01:09:08,176 --> 01:09:12,814
EVER REASON NOT TO WANT ROBERT 

1943
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:13,215
MUELLER GO AWAY. 

1944
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:14,450
HE HAS THE KEYS TO HIS FREEDOM 

1945
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,884
OR AT LEAST TO A LESSER 

1946
01:09:15,884 --> 01:09:16,151
SENTENCE. 

1947
01:09:16,151 --> 01:09:17,118
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW 

1948
01:09:17,118 --> 01:09:21,390
YORK IS ON ITS OWN, DEALING 

1949
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:22,558
WITH MICHAEL  COHAN AND 

1950
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,926
WHATEVER FALLS OUT FROM THAT. 

1951
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,160
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE 

1952
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,263
FOR THE STATE OF NEW YORK HAS 

1953
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,997
GONE FORWARD WITH THE CIVIL 

1954
01:09:28,997 --> 01:09:29,865
SUIT AGAINST THE TRUMP 

1955
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:32,901
FOUNDATION, WHICH THEN LED TO A 

1956
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:34,603
REFERRAL FOR CRIMINAL REFERRAL 

1957
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:35,638
TO THE I.R.S. 

1958
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:37,238
AND THE FEDERAL ELECTION 

1959
01:09:37,238 --> 01:09:38,607
COMMISSION, AND SO, THOSE ARE 

1960
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:41,944
GOING FORWARD, AND SO, NO, IT 

1961
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:44,245
IS NOT GOING TO. 

1962
01:09:44,245 --> 01:09:46,982
AGAIN, THE QUOTE, END QUOTE, 

1963
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:47,381
RUSSIAN COLLUSION 

1964
01:09:47,381 --> 01:09:49,084
INVESTIGATION, IT WOULD BE THE 

1965
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:51,120
ONE WITH ROBERT MUELLER THAT 

1966
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,856
COULD GO BY THE BOARDS, AND 

1967
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,225
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, AS IT 

1968
01:09:56,225 --> 01:10:01,664
CONCERNS, NOT ONLY THE 

1969
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:02,998
POSSIBILITY OF LOOKING AT THE 

1970
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,199
PRESIDENT, BUT THE PRESIDENT'S 

1971
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:04,466
FAMILY. 

1972
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:05,601
THOSE ARE, OF COURSE, THE MOST 

1973
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:06,936
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DONALD 

1974
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:07,169
TRUMP. 

1975
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:07,903
>> HE TALKED ABOUT THAT. 

1976
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:09,204
HE SAID THAT'S THE RED LINE. 

1977
01:10:09,204 --> 01:10:09,638
>> YEAH. 

1978
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:13,042
>> AND WE HAVE GOT THIS SOUND 

1979
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,177
BITE FROM JOHN DICKERSON 

1980
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:16,278
INTERVIEWING TREY GOUTY 

1981
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,313
YESTERDAY, AND LET'S PLAY A 

1982
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:18,514
LITTLE BIT OF THAT. 

1983
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:23,252
ED F YOU'RE STILL  -- ED, IF 

1984
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:24,520
YOU'RE STILL WITH US, I WILL 

1985
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:29,391
GET YOU TO  REACT. 

1986
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,260
>> I'M SURE AT SOME POINT, THE 

1987
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,062
PRESIDENT WILL SAY ROD, IF YOU 

1988
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,363
THINK I'M INCOMPETENT F YOU 

1989
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:39,368
FEEL THE NEED TO WEAR  -- IF 

1990
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:44,173
YOU FEEL THE NEED TO WEAR A  

1991
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:50,979
WIRE, WHY ARE YOU SERVING IN MY 

1992
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:51,346
ADMINISTRATION. 

1993
01:10:51,346 --> 01:10:54,883
HE MAY SAY IT NEVER HAPPENED. 

1994
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:56,151
LOOK AT THE McCABE MEMOS, FIND 

1995
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,786
OUT WHO WAS IN THE ROOM, AND 

1996
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:00,689
GIVE ROD A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN IF 

1997
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,224
IT WAS TRUE, AND THE CONTEXT TO 

1998
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:03,558
WHICH IT WAS SAID. 

1999
01:11:03,558 --> 01:11:05,261
ONE THING THAT IS CLEAR, A 

2000
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:05,994
REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT 

2001
01:11:05,994 --> 01:11:07,529
PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT 

2002
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,999
TO A DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL 

2003
01:11:10,999 --> 01:11:12,668
WHO DOES NOT THINK YOU'RE 

2004
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:13,635
INCOMPETENT AND DOESN'T FEEL 

2005
01:11:13,635 --> 01:11:14,870
THE NEED TO TAPE CONVERSATIONS 

2006
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:15,170
WITH YOU. 

2007
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,406
>> AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE 

2008
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,441
PRESIDENT'S COMMENT ABOUT HIS 

2009
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:24,613
ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHEN ASKED IN 

2010
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,148
HAVE AN  ATTORNEY GENERAL. 

2011
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,549
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE GENERAL 

2012
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:28,684
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT 

2013
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,752
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE? 

2014
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:32,387
>> IT'S TERRIBLE. 

2015
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:35,157
IT'S HEART BREAKING, AND I 

2016
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:36,258
UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT'S 

2017
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:37,493
FRUSTRATION, THE FRUSTRATION 

2018
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:39,762
THAT HE PICKED, OUT OF ALL OF 

2019
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,964
THE FRATERNITIES HE COULD HAVE 

2020
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:45,434
PICKED, HE PICKED ONE THAT HAD 

2021
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,836
TO REACCUSE HIMSELF FROM THE 

2022
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:48,370
OFFICE'S MOST SIGNIFICANT 

2023
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:51,840
INVESTIGATION, BUT HE DID PICK 

2024
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,441
HIM. 

2025
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,309
I WOULD PREFER THEY KEEP THEIR 

2026
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:54,977
DIFFERENCES PRIVATE, AND 

2027
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,712
THERE'S NOTHING TO KEEP THE 

2028
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,547
PRESIDENT FROM BRINGING JEFF 

2029
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:01,884
SESSIONS OVER AND HAVING A 

2030
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:02,918
STERN CONVERSATION ABOUT 

2031
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:05,187
PRIORITIES OR POLICIES, BUT THE 

2032
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:07,322
PUBLIC FIGHTING TO ME, IT'S A 

2033
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:09,658
DIFFERENT OFFICE, NOT THE 

2034
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,460
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OR 

2035
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,728
COMMERCE, IT'S A BLINDFOLDED 

2036
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:13,829
WOMAN HOLDING SCALES THAT EACH 

2037
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,898
OF US HAS TO HAVE CONVERSATION 

2038
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:20,702
IN, AND IT IS SAD TO WATCH, 

2039
01:12:20,702 --> 01:12:21,336
QUITE FRANKLY. 

2040
01:12:21,336 --> 01:12:26,308
>> ED, YOU KNOW, TREY SAYING 

2041
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:27,576
THE PRESIDENT COULD VERY WELL 

2042
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:30,379
BRING HIM IN SAYING IF YOU FEEL 

2043
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:32,948
I'M INCOMPETITION AND YOU FEEL 

2044
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,117
THE NEED TO WEAR A WIRE WHY ARE 

2045
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,252
YOU IN MY ADMINISTRATION? 

2046
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:40,122
>> THAT'S A VALID POINT, 

2047
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:42,024
EVERYONE SERVES IN A POLITICAL 

2048
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,492
APPOINTED JOB SERVES AT THE 

2049
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:44,726
PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT, NO 

2050
01:12:44,726 --> 01:12:46,895
MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS. 

2051
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,964
SHOULD THEY HAVE CONCERNS OVER 

2052
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:49,798
THE PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP OR 

2053
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:53,569
SPEAK OUT IN A BRASH WAY, AND 

2054
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:56,171
THEN HAVE IT REPORTED, IT'S 

2055
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:57,940
GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL, AND IT 

2056
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,040
SHOULD NOT SURPRISE ANYBODY. 

2057
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,944
THE CONCERN HERE AS THE 

2058
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:03,879
CONGRESSMAN SAID, IT'S A 

2059
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:04,746
SENSITIVE PROJECT, SENSITIVE 

2060
01:13:04,746 --> 01:13:05,914
MISSION THAT ROSENSTEIN HAS 

2061
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:06,982
BEEN TASKED WITH OVERSEEING FOR 

2062
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,751
THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF OR SO, 

2063
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:22,264
AND HIM GOING COULD POTENTIALLY 

2064
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:27,235
UPSET THE CART. 

2065
01:13:27,235 --> 01:13:28,904
THIS HAS A REAL POTENTIAL TO 

2066
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,405
UPEND A LOT OF THINGS. 

2067
01:13:30,405 --> 01:13:31,473
CHATTER ON TWITTER AND OTHER 

2068
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:33,008
PLACES ABOUT, YOU KNOW, IT 

2069
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:38,514
COULD REALLY UNDERMINE THE RULE 

2070
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:41,950
OF LAW, AND IT COULD CREATE A 

2071
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,685
POLITICAL CRISIS LIKE A 

2072
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:46,454
SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE IN SLOW 

2073
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:46,688
MOTION. 

2074
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:47,556
WE WILL SEE WHAT TRANSPIRES 

2075
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:48,590
HERE, BUT THERE'S THE CONCERN 

2076
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,959
IN WASHINGTON AS WE WAIT AND 

2077
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:52,027
SEE WHAT IS EXACTLY TRANSPIRING 

2078
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:53,662
BEFORE US AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

2079
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,864
>> THE OTHER THING HE SAID, ROD 

2080
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:57,566
ROSENSTEIN DESERVES TO BE 

2081
01:13:57,566 --> 01:14:00,068
HEARD, AND I WONDER, YOU KNOW, 

2082
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:01,837
WHAT THE FALLOUT COULD BE, IF 

2083
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,006
THE PERCEPTION IS THAT THE 

2084
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:08,544
PRESIDENT WAS JUST WAITING FOR 

2085
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,078
AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVER THAT THE 

2086
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:11,413
NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE GAVE HIM 

2087
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:13,248
TO GET RIM OF HIM. 

2088
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:14,483
IF THAT'S THE WAY IT'S 

2089
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:16,218
PERCEIVED, COULD WE SEE SOME 

2090
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:17,686
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS PUSHING 

2091
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:21,189
BACK IN A VERY SORT OF 

2092
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:24,159
ASSERTIVE WAY AGAINST THE 

2093
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:24,459
PRESIDENT? 

2094
01:14:24,459 --> 01:14:25,727
>> YOU COULD, TOTALLY, 

2095
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:26,027
ABSOLUTELY. 

2096
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:26,962
THERE'S BEEN REPUBLICANS WHO 

2097
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:27,896
SAID IT, AND THERE'S 

2098
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,831
REPUBLICANS WHO SAID IT 

2099
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:30,131
PRIVATELY. 

2100
01:14:30,131 --> 01:14:31,099
SHOULD SOMETHING LIKE THIS 

2101
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:33,535
TRANSPIRE, SHOULD THERE START 

2102
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,037
TO BE A REARRANGEMENT OF THE 

2103
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:37,005
DECK CHAIRS, IF YOU WILL AT THE 

2104
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,273
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, THEY WILL 

2105
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:40,075
EXPRESS CONCERN, AND THEY MAY 

2106
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:41,977
STEP IN WITH LEGISLATION TO 

2107
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:45,947
SAVE GUARD THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. 

2108
01:14:45,947 --> 01:14:50,552
IF SENATORS LIKE THOM TILLIS 

2109
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:53,255
AND BOB CORKIER HAVE BEEN 

2110
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:57,793
INVOLVED, DEMOCRATS LIKE 

2111
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:01,663
RICHARD BLOOMENNAL, THE -- 

2112
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:01,996
BLOOMENTHAL. 

2113
01:15:01,996 --> 01:15:03,165
THE KEY IS ONE OTHER THING 

2114
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,333
GOING ON IN WASHINGTON, LIKE WE 

2115
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,735
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO TALK 

2116
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:07,836
ABOUT, THE SUPREME COURT 

2117
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:08,736
NOMINATION MESS, BUT GOVERNMENT 

2118
01:15:08,736 --> 01:15:10,539
FUNDING IS RUNNING OUT ON 

2119
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,007
FRIDAY, AND THERE'S THE REAL 

2120
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,141
POTENTIAL IF THERE'S NOT A 

2121
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:17,379
QUICK AGREEMENT HERE F THE 

2122
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:19,548
PRESIDENT  -- IF THE PRESIDENT 

2123
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:25,954
DOESN'T PUT HIS SIGNATURE TO 

2124
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:28,056
PAPER, YOU COULD SEE HOW IT ALL 

2125
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:28,356
PLAYS OUT. 

2126
01:15:28,356 --> 01:15:29,958
THAT'S HANGING OVER ALL OF 

2127
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:30,158
THIS. 

2128
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:32,828
THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT AGREED TO 

2129
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:35,964
SEND THE TEMPORARY SPENDING 

2130
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:36,931
AGREEMENT PUT IN PLACE. 

2131
01:15:36,931 --> 01:15:38,900
IF HE REJECTS IT FOR SOME 

2132
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,869
REASON, THAT COULD CAUSE 

2133
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:43,372
CALAMITY AND A POTENTIAL 

2134
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:43,639
SHUTDOWN. 

2135
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:49,344
I REALIZE THIS IS A MOMENT WE 

2136
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:49,744
ARE SPECULATING. 

2137
01:15:49,744 --> 01:15:50,779
BECAUSE WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT 

2138
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:53,415
WHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND US, BUT 

2139
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:54,182
IT'S FAST MOVING. 

2140
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,317
MADE MORE TRICKY TODAY BY THE 

2141
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:56,818
FACT THE PRESIDENT IS IN NEW 

2142
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:58,954
YORK AND HIS CHIEF OF STAFF AND 

2143
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:00,889
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ARE 

2144
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,024
HERE, AND THERE'S SO MANY OTHER 

2145
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:03,058
THINGS PERCOLATING IN 

2146
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:04,092
WASHINGTON AND ON THE GLOBAL 

2147
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:05,961
STAGE IN NEW YORK THAT COULD 

2148
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:06,728
COMPLICATE THIS MORE. 

2149
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:09,398
THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT WANT TO 

2150
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,999
BE SEEN AS VULNERABLE IN FRONT 

2151
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,468
OF WORLD LEADERS THIS WEEK, AND 

2152
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:14,836
BACK IN WASHINGTON, FACING 

2153
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:17,306
OTHER PROBLEMS WITH HIS SUPREME 

2154
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:18,373
COURT NOMINATION AND POTENTIAL 

2155
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:19,808
PROBLEMS WITH HIS SPENDING 

2156
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:20,909
LEGISLATION, AND ALL OF THIS 

2157
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,344
COMES AT TRICKY MOMENT FOR THE 

2158
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:23,745
WHITE HOUSE AND THE JUSTICE 

2159
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,681
DEPARTMENT AND EVERYONE IN 

2160
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:26,048
WASHINGTON. 

2161
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:28,817
>> IT'S INTERESTING ED, THAT 

2162
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:31,753
YOU POINTED TO THE SATURDAY 

2163
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:34,957
NIGHT MASSACRE IN SLOW MOTION, 

2164
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:36,324
AND IF MY MEMORY SERVES 

2165
01:16:36,324 --> 01:16:37,926
CORRECTLY IT WAS OCTOBER 1973, 

2166
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,695
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AWAY 

2167
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:40,796
FROM OCTOBER, AND TO REMIND 

2168
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:42,030
VIEWERS, THAT'S WHEN THE 

2169
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:46,602
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 

2170
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:53,875
THEN RICHARD NIXON DECIDED TO 

2171
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:54,275
FIRE ACHIBAL. 

2172
01:16:54,275 --> 01:16:57,012
MR.RICHARDSON DECLINED TO DO SO 

2173
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:57,379
AND RESIGNED. 

2174
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:58,547
HE ASKED THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 

2175
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:02,117
GENERAL TO FIRE HIM, AND HE 

2176
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:02,384
RESIGNED. 

2177
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:03,151
HE APPOINTED ROBERT BORK WHO 

2178
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,087
DID WHAT HE WANTED TO, AND YOU 

2179
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:07,089
SAID EARLIER IF THE PRESIDENT, 

2180
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,123
WE ALL SERVE AT THE PLEASURE OF 

2181
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,424
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

2182
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:11,259
STATES, IF THERE IS CAUSE, THE 

2183
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:12,260
SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE, NO 

2184
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,595
CAUSE, IS THERE CAUSE HERE IF 

2185
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:15,764
YOU'RE TRYING TO RELATE THE 

2186
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:17,032
TWO? 

2187
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:18,900
>> I THINK THAT IS UP TO 

2188
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:19,133
DEBATE. 

2189
01:17:19,133 --> 01:17:26,607
THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM. 

2190
01:17:26,607 --> 01:17:27,876
I THINK, REALLY, CAITLIN HAD 

2191
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:28,677
THE BEST PHRASE, YOU'RE TALKING 

2192
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:29,945
ABOUT THE FACT IF THERE'S REAL 

2193
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:33,548
CAUSE, AND WHAT IS IN THE MIND 

2194
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:39,521
OF ROD ROSENSTEIN ABOUT HOW HE 

2195
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:42,591
PERCEIVES HOW THIS IS BEING  

2196
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:43,925
HEARD IN THE COUNTRY. 

2197
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:46,294
DOES HE THINK IT MAKES HIM LESS 

2198
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:46,828
EFFECTIVE? 

2199
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,764
WHAT I DO SEE IN TERMS OF 

2200
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:50,732
REPORTING BESIDES THE FACT I 

2201
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:52,801
CAN SEE PAULA OUT OF THE CORNER 

2202
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:56,138
OF MY EYE, AND I'M GOING TO GET 

2203
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:57,139
A DEFINITIVE REVIEW, WITHIN 

2204
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:59,641
MINUTES OF EACH OTHER, THE WALL 

2205
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:01,042
STREET JOURNAL REPORTED THAT 

2206
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:03,645
ROD ROSENSTEIN EXPECTED TO BE 

2207
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:05,113
FIRED, NOT RESIGNING AS THE 

2208
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:06,448
WASHINGTON POST REPORTED HE WAS 

2209
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:08,049
RESIGNING, AND TALK ABOUT A 

2210
01:18:08,049 --> 01:18:09,551
WORLD OF SPECULATION, AND THAT 

2211
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:16,958
BRINGS US BACK TO CAUSE. 

2212
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,560
IS JOKING A CAUSE, OR DOES IT 

2213
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,928
REALLY MEAN THE PRESIDENT CAN 

2214
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,830
LOOK AT THIS AND SAY, WHETHER 

2215
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,698
OR NOT YOU WERE JOKING, WHICH 

2216
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:24,666
WAS INAPPROPRIATE, OR WHETHER 

2217
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:27,469
OR NOT YOU WERE SERIOUS, IT 

2218
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,938
MAKES YOU INEFFECTIVE TO HAVE 

2219
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:30,238
THIS ROLE. 

2220
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:30,706
>> UH-UH. 

2221
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:30,939
RIGHT. 

2222
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:32,374
>> SO, WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE 

2223
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,909
TO COVER THIS, AND WHAT YOU ARE 

2224
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:35,443
SEEING RIGHT THERE, THE SHOT OF 

2225
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:37,078
THE PARKING LOT WITH, WHAT YOU 

2226
01:18:37,078 --> 01:18:38,613
CANNOT TELL, IT'S THE VIEW OF 

2227
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:40,048
THE ENTRANCE INTO THE WHITE 

2228
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,650
HOUSE, AND WE ARE EXPECTING ROD 

2229
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:42,784
ROSENSTEIN WILL GO TO THE WHITE 

2230
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:44,019
HOUSE, AND HE COULD BE THERE 

2231
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,288
FOR ALL WE KNOW, BUT THIS IS 

2232
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:50,192
THE BEST -- THIS IS OUR BEST 

2233
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:51,526
GUESS, IF HE WAS COMING, THIS 

2234
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:54,963
IS WHERE HE IS COMING IN AND 

2235
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:55,263
OUT OF. 

2236
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:56,264
THE REPORTING, THERE'S A 

2237
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:57,999
POSSIBILITY THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN 

2238
01:18:57,999 --> 01:19:00,802
COULD BE FIRED OR RESIGN, AND 

2239
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,270
THAT'S ACCORDING TO AXIOS, BUT 

2240
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,104
THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY 

2241
01:19:03,104 --> 01:19:04,506
HE'S GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE 

2242
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:05,574
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION, PERHAPS 

2243
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,575
A CUP OF TEA. 

2244
01:19:07,575 --> 01:19:08,109
WE DON'T KNOW. 

2245
01:19:08,109 --> 01:19:09,343
>> OR A STERN TONGUE LASHING. 

2246
01:19:09,343 --> 01:19:12,881
>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK 

2247
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:13,682
AND CONTINUE TO COVER THIS. 

2248
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:14,482
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN, CBS 

2249
01:19:14,482 --> 01:19:15,317
NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 

2250
01:22:07,454 --> 01:22:10,025

CAMERA TRAINED ON AT THE WHITE 

2252
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,094
HOUSE WHERE WE EXPECT, OR WE 

2253
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:15,530
HOPE AT LEAST, WE WILL SEE OR 

2254
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:18,099
CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE DEPUTY 

2255
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:18,833
ATTORNEY GENERAL, ROD

WHITE HOUSE, AND HE'S BEEN 

2259
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:23,437
SUMMONED THERE. 

2260

FOR WHAT, WE DO NOT EXACTLY 

2261
01:22:25,673 --> 01:22:25,974
KNOW. 

2262
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:27,609
IT'S BEEN SPECULATED HE IS 

2263
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:31,212
GOING TO RESIGN, OR HE MAY BE 

2264
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:33,415
FIRED, BY THE CHIEF OF STAFF,

01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:33,748
JOHN KELLY. 

2266

IS, HAS HE HAD THE BIG TALK 

2280
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:57,839
YET? 

2281
01:22:57,839 --> 01:22:59,441
THEY HAD IT AND THINGS ARE 

2282
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:00,275
PENDING? 

2283
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:01,542

DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO 

2320
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:03,104
VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

2321
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:04,839
SOMETIMES WE GET EXCITED WHEN 

2322
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:06,674
HE IS SPOTTED BY CAMERAS, BUT 

2323
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:09,210
HE'S THERE TWICE A WEEK.

FIRED OR LET GO. 

2332
01:24:19,186 --> 01:24:21,189
>> WOULDN'T YOU IF YOU WERE 

2333
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:22,123
HIM, WOULDN'T YOU THINK THAT? 

2334
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:23,992

PRESIDENT. 

2336
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:25,560
NOT JUST FROM THE REPORTING WE

SAW ABOUT THE 5th AMENDMENT, 

2338
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:29,964
BUT RECENTLY, ALSO, THE TWEETS, 

2339
01:24:29,964 --> 01:24:32,100
AND THE INCREASED ATTACKS HE 

2340
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,402
HAS BEEN SORT OF ENDURING, AND 

2341
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:36,938
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY HE 

2342
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:39,541
WOULD THINK HE COULD GET FIRED 

2343
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:39,774
NOW. 

2344
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:40,141
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

2345
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:41,676
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE TALKED 

2346
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:45,547
ABOUT THIS, BUT THE PRESIDENT 

2347
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:48,016
DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HERALDO, 

2348
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:48,249
RIVERA. 

2349
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:48,650
>> WE DID. 

2350
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:50,251
>> 2 DAYS AGO, BEFORE THE NEWS, 

2351
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:51,486
THE PRESIDENT MAKES REFERENCE 

2352
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:53,621
TO THIS, BUT HE DIDN'T DO A 

2353
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:55,690
FULL DEFENSE OF THE DEPUTY 

2354
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:56,257
ATTORNEY GENERAL. 

2355
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:58,760
HE SAID IT'S A SAD STATE OF 

2356
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,061
AFFAIRS WHEN SOMETHING LIKE 

2357
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:00,795
THAT CAN HAPPEN. 

2358
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:02,197
LET'S CIRCLE BACK TO THE 

2359
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:05,700
ALLEGATION, WHAT DO THEY 

2360
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,167
ALLEGATION HAPPENED? 

2361
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:07,235
>> THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING 

2362
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:10,304
THAT ROD ROSEN STEIN SUGGESTED 

2363
01:25:10,304 --> 01:25:11,306
IN MAY 2017, WIRETAPPING OR 

2364
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:12,674
RECORDING CONVERSATIONS WITH 

2365
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:13,041
THE PRESIDENT. 

2366
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,309
I SPOKE TO SOURCES IN THE 

2367
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:15,510
MEETING, AND THEY SAID, YES, HE 

2368
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:18,279
DID SAY THIS, BUT IT WAS A 

2369
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,714
JOKE, AND ANYONE WHO TALKS TO 

2370
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:26,187
ROD ROSENSTEIN KNOWS HE MAKES A 

2371
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:28,889
LOT OF JOKES. 

2372
01:25:28,889 --> 01:25:31,125
>> RIKK I  KLIEMAN SAID THE 

2373
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:31,458
SAME THING. 

2374
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:33,228
WE CALL THEM DAD JOKES. 

2375
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:34,796
HE LOOKS AROUND TO MAKE SURE 

2376
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:35,897
EVERYONE IS COMFORTABLE AND 

2377
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:36,764
GIGGLING A LOT. 

2378
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:38,933
THE OTHER SUGGESTION IS HE HAD 

2379
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:39,801
REFERENCE USING THE 25th 

2380
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:40,768
AMENDMENT TO OUST THE 

2381
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:42,570
PRESIDENT, AND NO ONE I HAVE 

2382
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,639
SPOKE WITH, I SPOKE TO HALF A 

2383
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,108
DOZEN SOURCES, AND NO ONE HEARD 

2384
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:47,842
THAT BEING SAID. 

2385
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:49,010
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BELIEVE IN 

2386
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:51,479
ORDER TO GO ALONG WITH THAT IS 

2387
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:53,047
THAT ROSENSTEIN THOUGHT HE 

2388
01:25:53,047 --> 01:25:53,681
COULD GET TWO-THIRDS OF 

2389
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,249
CONGRESS TO OUST THE PRESIDENT 

2390
01:25:55,249 --> 01:25:56,951
IN MAY OF 2017. 

2391
01:25:56,951 --> 01:26:01,389
>> IN THE WAKE OF FIRING OF 

2392
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:03,825
JAMES COMEY WHICH HE ATTACHED 

2393
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:04,292
HIS NAME. 

2394
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:06,361
THE THING, THE TIMES ALSO 

2395
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:08,596
REPORTED THAT ROSENSTEIN 

2396
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:09,564
BELIEVED SESSIONS WOULD GO WITH 

2397
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:10,965
THE EFFORT TO OUST THE 

2398
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:12,667
PRESIDENT, AND ROD ROSENSTEIN 

2399
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:15,470
IS A VERY SMART MAN, CAREFUL 

2400
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:17,171
MAN, AND IT JUST DEFIES LOGIC 

2401
01:26:17,171 --> 01:26:19,040
THAT BACK IN MAY OF 2017 THE 

2402
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,775
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED 

2403
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:23,278
STATES, HIS FIRST SENATOR TO 

2404
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:24,779
COME OUT AND SUPPORT CANDIDATE 

2405
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:26,381
DONALD TRUMP, A SMART MAN IN 

2406
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:27,749
THE SENATE FOR DECADES, WOULD 

2407
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:29,517
BELIEVE AN EFFORT LIKE THAT 

2408
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:30,685
WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. 

2409
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:31,819
PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME, WHY 

2410
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:33,154
DOESN'T THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 

2411
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:33,387
RESIGN? 

2412
01:26:33,387 --> 01:26:35,122
WHY IS HE STILL IN OFFICE? 

2413
01:26:35,122 --> 01:26:36,557
EVEN IF HE DISAGREES WITH THE 

2414
01:26:36,557 --> 01:26:37,792
PRESIDENT, HE BELIEVE IN THE 

2415
01:26:37,792 --> 01:26:39,927
PLATFORM, AND HE BELIEVES IN 

2416
01:26:39,927 --> 01:26:40,361
THE AGENDA. 

2417
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:42,830
THAT'S WHY HE WORKS DAY IN AND 

2418
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,098
DAY OUT TO EXECUTE THAT. 

2419
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:46,601
THE IDEA HE THOUGHT HE WOULD GO 

2420
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:47,936
WITH THE 25th AMENDMENT, THAT 

2421
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:49,136
JUST DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. 

2422
01:26:49,136 --> 01:26:52,707
>> HE WAS NOT BEING TORCHED BY 

2423
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:53,875
THE PRESIDENT ON A CONSISTENT 

2424
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:54,108
BASIS. 

2425
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:55,042
>> NOTHING LIKE THAT. 

2426
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:56,210
>> TO THE LATEST REPORTING HE 

2427
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:59,013
HAD THE IDEA HE COULD BE FIRED, 

2428
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:01,382
IS THERE -- DOES THAT RING TRUE 

2429
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:01,615
TO YOU? 

2430
01:27:01,615 --> 01:27:04,285
>> THE QUESTION IS, WHY DID 

2431
01:27:04,285 --> 01:27:05,653
THESE MEMOS SURFACE ON FRIDAY? 

2432
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:07,121
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM? 

2433
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:09,857
I REPORTED IT OUT FROM HALF A 

2434
01:27:09,857 --> 01:27:10,324
DOZEN SOURCES. 

2435
01:27:10,324 --> 01:27:11,759
YES, THE COMMENTS WERE MADE, 

2436
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:13,361
BUT THE INTERPRETATION BY THE 

2437
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:14,529
SOURCES IN THE ROOM WAS 

2438
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:14,829
DIFFERENT. 

2439
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:16,764
THE NEW YORK TIMES WENT WITH 

2440
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:18,199
THEM SAYING THEY SPOKE TO 

2441
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:22,236
ANONYMOUS SOURCES WHO BELIEVED 

2442
01:27:22,236 --> 01:27:24,372
IT WAS A LEGITIMATE, SERIOUS 

2443
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:25,673
ACCUSATION TO RECORD THE 

2444
01:27:25,673 --> 01:27:25,973
PRESIDENT. 

2445
01:27:25,973 --> 01:27:28,243
>> THEY SAID IT'S NOT A LEAK, 

2446
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,311
THEY SAID THEY HAVE BEEN 

2447
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:32,513
REPORTING ON THIS FOR A YEAR. 

2448
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:33,681
PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONED THEIR 

2449
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:35,916
REPORTING, AND THEY SAID -- 

2450
01:27:35,916 --> 01:27:37,118
>> THEY HAVE COME UNDER 

2451
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:37,618
CONSIDERABLE SCRUTINY. 

2452
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:38,786
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 

2453
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:40,221
THE MEETING, AND IT'S NOT TOO 

2454
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:42,390
HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS IN 

2455
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,025
THE MEETING, WHO IS WORKING FOR 

2456
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:46,094
ROD ROSENSTEIN AT THAT TIME? 

2457
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:47,929
WHO IS WORKING THE FBI AT THAT 

2458
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:48,129
TIME? 

2459
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:50,932
PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS WHY THE 

2460
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,634
NEW YORK TIMES, TWO FANTASTIC 

2461
01:27:53,634 --> 01:27:55,203
REPORTERS, GOLDMAN AND SCHMITT, 

2462
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:57,038
WHY THEY WOULD RELY ON THE 

2463
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:57,672
ANONYMOUS SOURCES FOR SOMETHING 

2464
01:27:57,672 --> 01:27:59,240
THAT COULD SET THE PRESIDENT 

2465
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,242
OFF, RESULTING UNTIL THE FIRING 

2466
01:28:01,242 --> 01:28:01,676
OF ROSENSTEIN. 

2467
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:03,778
THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYS PEOPLE 

2468
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:05,413
HAVE MATCHED IT BUT MYSELF 

2469
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:06,347
INCLUDED, WE MATCHED THE 

2470
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:09,150
COMMENT WAS MADE, BUT MY 

2471
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:12,353
SOURCES SAID IT WAS A SARCASTIC 

2472
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:13,987
STONE, AND ROD ROSENSTEIN MAY 

2473
01:28:13,987 --> 01:28:15,390
KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING BEHIND 

2474
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:16,657
THE SCENES, AND PERHAPS THERE'S 

2475
01:28:16,657 --> 01:28:18,226
A PUSH TO OUST HIM, AND INSTEAD 

2476
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:19,660
OF BEING FIRED HE WANTS TO 

2477
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:21,262
RESIGN, BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY 

2478
01:28:21,262 --> 01:28:21,696
TODAY. 

2479
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:22,797
>> ANYTHING IN THE REPORTING 

2480
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:24,799
THAT SIGNALED TO YOU AND YOUR 

2481

OWN REPORTING THAT ROD 

2482
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:27,702
ROSENSTEIN, WE HAVE SEEN HIM 

2483
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:29,537
MAKE PUBLIC STATEMENTS, AND 

2484
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:30,605
HE'S GIVEN SPEECHES, AND HE'S 

2485
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:32,173
EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE IN HIS 

2486
01:28:32,173 --> 01:28:33,341

YOUR REPORTING THAT SIGNALED TO 

2490

YOU, MAYBE HIS FRAME OF MIND, 

2491
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:42,917
HE FELT, PERHAPS HE WAS 

2492
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:45,586
COMPROMISED IN TERMS OF THE 

2493
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:48,055
RUNNING THE INVESTIGATION, IN

OVERSEE THE INVESTIGATION? 

2496
01:28:53,794 --> 01:28:55,363
>> PEOPLE IN THE JUSTICE 

2497
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:56,531
DEPARTMENT ARE SHOCKED BECAUSE 

2498
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:58,933
HE CAME OUT WITH THE DENIAL ON 

2499
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:00,234
FRIDAY, SAYING IT'S ABSOLUTELY 

2500
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:00,701
NOT TRUE. 

2501
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:02,336
HE COULD HAVE SAID NO COMMENT, 

2502
01:29:02,336 --> 01:29:03,805
BUT IT WAS TWO DIFFERENT 

2503
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:04,105
STATEMENTS. 

2504
01:29:04,105 --> 01:29:07,675
>> ONE SORT OF ALIKE, AND THEN 

2505
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:09,243
ONE MUCH STRONGER WORDED. 

2506
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:10,044
>> ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE 25th 

2507
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:11,779
AMENDMENT ISSUE, AND IT'S NOT 

2508
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:12,680
CLEAR WHAT TRANSPIRED FROM 

2509
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,549
FRIDAY TO NOW TO MAKE HIM GO TO 

2510
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:17,251
THE WHITE HOUSE BELIEVING HE 

2511
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:18,018
WOULD BE FIRED. 

2512
01:29:18,018 --> 01:29:19,554
WE MAY GET TO THE END OF THE 

2513
01:29:19,554 --> 01:29:21,021
DAY AND REALIZE IT WAS ALL 

2514
01:29:21,021 --> 01:29:22,290
SEMATICS AND HE HAD TO GO TO 

2515
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:23,524
THE MEETING, AND HE EXPECTED TO 

2516
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:24,826
BE CANNED AFTER THE MEETING AND 

2517
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:26,360
IT GOT OUT OF CONTROL, BUT WHAT 

2518
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,396
I WAS TOLD FROM THE JUSTICE 

2519
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:29,197
DEPARTMENT, ABOUT 2 HOURS AGO, 

2520
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,865
HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE WHITE 

2521
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:32,733
HOUSE, AND HE EXPECTED TO BE 

2522
01:29:32,733 --> 01:29:33,368
FIRED. 

2523
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:36,771
>> THAT IS JUST -- I'M 

2524
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:37,939
CONCERNED ABOUT OURSELVES AND 

2525
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:39,607
OUR OWN REPORTING. 

2526
01:29:39,607 --> 01:29:42,376
YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE 

2527
01:29:42,376 --> 01:29:44,712
ANYTHING, BUT IT WOULD BE A 

2528
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:47,715
BOMB IF HE WAS TO RESIGN OR TO 

2529
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:49,851
BE LET GO, AND WE TALK ABOUT 

2530
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:51,319
HOW THAT BOMB WOULD 

2531
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:53,654
REVERBERATE, NOT JUST WITH THE 

2532
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:55,690
MULLER INVESTIGATION, EVEN IF 

2533
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:57,325
THE MULLER INVESTIGATION IS 

2534
01:29:57,325 --> 01:29:57,992
CHUGGING ALONG, UNTOUCHED, IT'S 

2535
01:29:57,992 --> 01:29:59,861
THE PERCEPTION THAT CAN BE 

2536
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:01,462
ALMOST THE MOST DAMAGING, NOT 

2537
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:02,263
JUST FOR THE MULLER 

2538
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:03,130
INVESTIGATION AND WHETHER OR 

2539
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:04,999
NOT THEY ARE BEHIND THE SCENES, 

2540
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:06,667
BEING PRESSURED TO SHUT IT 

2541
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:08,603
DOWN, BUT ALSO FOR THE UPCOMING 

2542
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:09,303
MIDTERM ELECTIONS, AND THE 

2543
01:30:09,303 --> 01:30:10,037
PERCEPTION OF THE PRESIDENT, 

2544
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:12,806
WHO IS SAT THE U.N., TRYING TO 

2545
01:30:12,806 --> 01:30:13,540
LOOK PRESIDENTIAL. 

2546
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,509
>> IN FRONT OF ALL THE WORLD. 

2547
01:30:15,509 --> 01:30:17,110
>> RIGHT, TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT 

2548
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:18,946
THE Ws HE HAS, AND YOU KNOW, 

2549
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:20,948
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT 

2550
01:30:20,948 --> 01:30:22,784
NORTH KOREA, I THINK THERE'S 

2551
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:24,685
DEFINITELY MORE PROGRESS THERE 

2552
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:26,320
THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN A VERY 

2553
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,422
LONG TIME, AND NOW THERE'S A 

2554
01:30:28,422 --> 01:30:29,524
MASSIVE DISTRACTION THAT WE 

2555
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:30,558
DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH 

2556
01:30:30,558 --> 01:30:32,360
SUBSTANCE THERE IS TO IT. 

2557
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,928
>> IF YOU'RE A WORLD LEADER, 

2558
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:34,962
ARE YOU NEGOTIATING WITH THE 

2559
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:37,565
PERSON WHO YOU THINK BECAUSE OF 

2560
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:39,200
WHAT YOU SEE HAPPENING ACROSS 

2561
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,635
YOUR CABINET, YOUR GOVERNMENT 

2562
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:41,836
EVERY SINGLE DAY, YOU'RE 

2563
01:30:41,836 --> 01:30:44,605
SITTING IN FRONT OF IN A YEAR? 

2564
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:47,108
>> THAT WAS MY POLITICAL 

2565
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:47,541
INTEREST, WHY NOW? 

2566
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:49,310
THAT IS WHY I'M INTERESTED IN 

2567
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:50,144
WHO STARTED THE CONVERSATION, 

2568
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:51,612
AND IT WOULD NOT BE IN THE 

2569
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:53,014
POLITICAL INTEREST OF THE 

2570
01:30:53,014 --> 01:30:55,349
PRESIDENT TO DO THIS NOW, AND 

2571
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:58,052
NOT ONLY IS HE APPEARING BEFORE 

2572
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:03,691
WORLD LEADERS, WANTING TO EXERT 

2573
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:04,725
HIS INFLUENCE ON THE NATIONAL 

2574
01:31:04,725 --> 01:31:06,694
STAGE, HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A 

2575
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:08,663
SUPREME COURT FIGHT, WITH MORE 

2576
01:31:08,663 --> 01:31:09,897
REPORTING COMING OUT YESTERDAY 

2577
01:31:09,897 --> 01:31:11,265
RAISING MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT 

2578
01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:11,565
KAVANAUGH. 

2579
01:31:11,565 --> 01:31:13,668
VERY MUCH UP IN THE AIR, AND 

2580
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:15,469
THAT WOULD BE HIS SUPREME 

2581
01:31:15,469 --> 01:31:17,004
COURT, HIS CORE ACHIEVEMENT AND 

2582
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:18,773
SELLING POINT INTO THE MIDTERM, 

2583
01:31:18,773 --> 01:31:20,174
AND THAT'S WHY I WAS WONDERING 

2584
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:21,842
WHO INITIATED THE CONVERSATION. 

2585
01:31:21,842 --> 01:31:23,077
IT CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE IN 

2586
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:24,078
THE INTEREST OF THE PRESIDENT 

2587
01:31:24,078 --> 01:31:24,912
TO START THIS NOW. 

2588
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:26,781
>> PAULA, YOU'RE CHATTING WITH 

2589
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:28,349
SOURCES AS WE ARE TALKING, BUT 

2590
01:31:28,349 --> 01:31:29,817
THE REPORTING OUT THERE SEEMS 

2591
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,419
TO SUGGEST, BECAUSE THE WAY THE 

2592
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:32,920
PRESIDENT HAS REACTED OVER THE 

2593
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:36,157
PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, AND YOU 

2594
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,058
KNOW, NUMEROUS OUTLETS HAVE 

2595
01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:38,326
REPORTED THIS, HE IS QUOTE AT 

2596
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:40,361
WAR WITH THE JUSTICE 

2597
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:40,795
DEPARTMENT. 

2598
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:41,629
DO THE CAREER OFFICIALS YOU 

2599
01:31:41,629 --> 01:31:43,297
SPEAK TO, THE CAREER MEN AND 

2600
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:45,833
WOMEN WHO SERVE IN THE JUSTICE  

2601
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:47,535
IS AT WAR WITH THEM? 

2602
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:52,106
>> HE'S CERTAINLY NOT 

2603
01:31:52,106 --> 01:31:54,041
SUPPORTIVE. 

2604
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:56,344
SAYING THE  FBI IS IN TATTERED, 

2605
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:57,845
IN FRIDAY IN MISSOURI HE TALKED 

2606
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:59,647
ABOUT THE STENCH FROM THE 

2607
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:00,080
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 

2608
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:03,718
THE FBI IS PART OF THE JUSTICE 

2609
01:32:03,718 --> 01:32:04,752
DEPARTMENT, AND HE ROUTINELY 

2610
01:32:04,752 --> 01:32:05,620
CRITICIZES HIS OWN ATTORNEY 

2611
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:06,587
GENERAL, AND I THINK ABSOLUTELY 

2612
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:07,955
THE PEOPLE IN THE RANK AND FILE 

2613
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:12,393
DO NOT FEEL SUPPORTED. 

2614
01:32:16,396 --> 01:32:21,636
>> SO, AND IT'S INTERESTING TO 

2615
01:32:21,636 --> 01:32:21,836
ME. 

2616
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:23,504
WE HAD DAN SENIOR ON HERE, AND 

2617
01:32:23,504 --> 01:32:28,776
I ASKED IF HE THOUGHT 

2618
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:29,844
REPUBLICANS WOULD BE ASSOCIATED 

2619
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:32,046
WITH ATTACKS ON THE FBI AND THE 

2620
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:32,947
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY 

2621
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:34,215
OFTEN SAY WE ARE NOT TALKING 

2622
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:37,051
ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE 

2623
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:41,856
FRONT LINES, BUT IS THERE A 

2624
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,790
KISS TINGS? 

2625
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:45,659
-- DISTINCTION? 

2626
01:32:45,659 --> 01:32:47,995
IT AFFECTS EVERYBODY? 

2627
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:48,996
>> IT DOES AFFECT EVERYBODY. 

2628
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:50,031
DAVID WORKED FOR THE FBI, AND 

2629
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:51,265
NOT FOCUSED ON RUSSIA, THAT'S A 

2630
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:52,667
TINY, MINUSCULE PART OF THE 

2631
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:55,169
WORK THEY ARE DOING, DAY IN AND 

2632
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:56,570
DAY OUT WORKING TO PROTECT US 

2633
01:32:56,570 --> 01:32:57,838
FROM INTERNATIONAL SECURITY 

2634
01:32:57,838 --> 01:32:59,540
THREATS, AND CYBER THREATS, THE 

2635
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:01,375
THREAT FROM CHINA, AND THERE'S 

2636
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:02,643
SO MANY FRONTS THEY WORK ON DAY 

2637
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:05,846
IN AND DAY OUT TO MAKE THE 

2638
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:06,179
COUNTRY SAFE. 

2639
01:33:06,179 --> 01:33:07,581
ABSOLUTELY THEY MAKE MISTAKES, 

2640
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:09,784
BUT PEOPLE LIKE PETER AND LISA, 

2641
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:11,018
IN THE TEXT MESSAGES THEY 

2642
01:33:11,018 --> 01:33:13,320
EXCHANGED, AND THAT IS A 

2643
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:13,587
PROBLEM. 

2644
01:33:13,587 --> 01:33:20,561
THAT IS NOT A GREAT  OPTIC FOR 

2645
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:21,862
THE FBI, AND PEOPLE WITH A 

2646
01:33:21,862 --> 01:33:23,431
POLITICAL SKIN SEIZED ON THAT 

2647
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:24,999
SAYING LOOK AT THE TEXT 

2648
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:26,434
MESSAGES, CAN YOU BELIEVE THE 

2649
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:28,436
THINGS THAT PETER STRUCK, 

2650
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:29,937
INVOLVED IN THE HILLARY CLINTON 

2651
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:30,838
INVESTIGATION, IS SAYING ABOUT 

2652
01:33:30,838 --> 01:33:33,908
THE PRESIDENT, THEN CANDIDATE,  

2653
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:35,109
THERE'S LIKE 1,000 OTHER TEXT 

2654
01:33:35,109 --> 01:33:37,211
MESSAGES, AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE 

2655
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:38,946
ANYTHING NICE TO SAY ABOUT 

2656
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:40,081
ANYBODY, BUT YOU CANNOT 

2657
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:41,282
DISCREDIT THE FACT HE WAS 

2658
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:44,218
INVOLVE IN THE TWO POLITICALLY 

2659
01:33:44,218 --> 01:33:44,918
SENSITIVE INVESTIGATIONS SAYING 

2660
01:33:44,918 --> 01:33:46,420
TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT CANDIDATE 

2661
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:49,924
TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS. 

2662
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:52,059
YOU CAN SEE WHY SOME PEOPLE WHY 

2663
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:55,863
WE SHOULD INVESTIGATE THAT AND 

2664
01:33:55,863 --> 01:33:57,398
MAKE SURE THERE'S NO POLITICAL 

2665
01:33:57,398 --> 01:33:57,598
BIAS. 

2666
01:33:57,598 --> 01:33:58,432
IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE 

2667
01:33:58,432 --> 01:33:59,867
TRANSPARENT AND HOLD THEM TO A 

2668
01:33:59,867 --> 01:34:01,702
HIGH STANDARD, BUT IT'S NOT 

2669
01:34:01,702 --> 01:34:02,369
GREAT FOR MORAL. 

2670
01:34:02,369 --> 01:34:03,904
>> WE HAVE ED O'KEEFE BACK IN 

2671
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:05,339
FRONT OF THE CAMERA AT THE 

2672
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:06,640
WHITE HOUSE, AND WE ARE GOING 

2673
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:10,945
TO GET TO SOME OTHER NEWS, BUT 

2674
01:34:10,945 --> 01:34:12,346
WE WILL ASK OUR COMMENTATORS 

2675
01:34:12,346 --> 01:34:14,215
AND REPORTS TO JUST GIVE US 

2676
01:34:14,215 --> 01:34:14,881
THEIR FINAL THOUGHTS. 

2677
01:34:14,881 --> 01:34:16,283
ED, HAVE YOU HEARD FROM ANY 

2678
01:34:16,283 --> 01:34:19,854
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AT ALL IN 

2679
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:21,388
THE WAKE OF THE NEWS? 

2680
01:34:21,388 --> 01:34:22,523
>> Reporter: I CHECKED WITH 

2681
01:34:22,523 --> 01:34:24,091
SEVERAL, AND THEY SAID THEY 

2682
01:34:24,091 --> 01:34:26,026
WERE WAITING TO SEE WHAT 

2683
01:34:26,026 --> 01:34:27,962
TRANSPIRED WHETHER OR NOT 

2684
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:32,133
ROSENSTEIN WAS BEING DISMISSED 

2685
01:34:32,133 --> 01:34:32,366
OR NOT. 

2686
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:33,768
GIVEN PAULA'S EXCELLENT 

2687
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:34,668
REPORTING IT'S A PREVIOUSLY 

2688
01:34:34,668 --> 01:34:36,003
SCHEDULED AFFAIR, NOT KICKED 

2689
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:37,471
OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION, IT 

2690
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:39,039
SEEMS ALL STATUS IS NORMAL, AND 

2691
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:41,041
WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER DAY 

2692
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:45,813
OR HOUR OF THIS DAY TO SEE IF 

2693
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:48,983
ROSENSTEIN IS GETTING 

2694
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:49,283
DISMISSED. 

2695
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:50,684
>> HAS ANYONE EXPRESSED 

2696
01:34:50,684 --> 01:34:50,984
EXHAUSTION? 

2697
01:34:50,984 --> 01:34:53,320
I MEAN I KNOW JUST SITTING AT 

2698
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,922
THE ANCHOR DESK -- WHAT IS 

2699
01:34:54,922 --> 01:34:56,323
GOING ON OVER THERE? 

2700
01:34:56,323 --> 01:34:59,059
WE CAN HEAR ALL SORTS OF NOISES 

2701
01:34:59,059 --> 01:34:59,559
BACK THERE. 

2702
01:34:59,559 --> 01:35:02,963
>> IT'S A TEST OF THE EMERGENCY 

2703
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:04,732
BROADCAST SYSTEM, ANNE-MARIE. 

2704
01:35:04,732 --> 01:35:05,165
>> PERFECT TIMING. 

2705
01:35:05,165 --> 01:35:06,534
>> ALWAYS PERFECT TIMING. 

2706
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:07,968
>> ABSOLUTELY PERFECT TIMING. 

2707
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:10,704
I WAS WONDERING IF THE 

2708
01:35:10,704 --> 01:35:11,706
LAWMAKERS HAVE EXPRESSED AN 

2709
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,874
EXASPERATION, IN THE MIDDLE THE 

2710
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:15,409
OF THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION, 

2711
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:16,944
THAT HAS BECOME INTENSE AND 

2712
01:35:16,944 --> 01:35:19,113
BIZARRE, WE HAVE THIS OTHER 

2713
01:35:19,113 --> 01:35:19,513
THING POPPING UP. 

2714
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:21,215
>> Reporter: RIGHT, I THINK YOU 

2715
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:22,750
WERE SAYING EVERYONE IS TIRED, 

2716
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:23,817
AND IT'S ONLY MONDAY. 

2717
01:35:23,817 --> 01:35:24,151
[ LAUGHTER ] 

2718
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:27,087
>> THERE IT GOES AGAIN. 

2719
01:35:27,087 --> 01:35:28,955
YEAH, -- CAN'T THEY -- OH. 

2720
01:35:28,955 --> 01:35:30,457
>> YEAH, MAYBE WE SHOULD PULL 

2721
01:35:30,457 --> 01:35:31,257
AWAY FROM ED O'KEEFE. 

2722
01:35:31,257 --> 01:35:33,293
>> IT'S GREAT TO KNOW IT WORKS. 

2723
01:35:33,293 --> 01:35:35,229
>> I FEEL LIKE ED NEEDS TO 

2724
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:36,429
PRESERVE HIS OWN HEARING. 

2725
01:35:36,429 --> 01:35:38,365
IF IT'S LOUD TO US, IT MUST BE 

2726
01:35:38,365 --> 01:35:40,100
REALLY LOUD TO HIM. 

2727
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:41,168
ED, I'M GOING TO PIVOT AWAY 

2728
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:41,468
FROM YOU. 

2729
01:35:41,468 --> 01:35:42,670
>> Reporter: I'M STILL HERE. 

2730
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:42,937
HOLD ON! 

2731
01:35:42,937 --> 01:35:45,306
I THINK IT'S OVER, IF IT'S 

2732
01:35:45,306 --> 01:35:46,607
OVER, BLOW THROUGH IT. 

2733
01:35:46,607 --> 01:35:47,374
PEOPLE ARE EXHAUSTED. 

2734
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:48,876
IT WAS A LONG WEEKEND, TOO, 

2735
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:51,078
BECAUSE, REMEMBER, YOU HAD THE 

2736
01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:51,645
ALLEGATIONS SURFACE AGAINST 

2737
01:35:51,645 --> 01:35:53,080
BRETT KAVANAUGH, AND YOU HAD 

2738
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,382
THE LINGERING CONCERNS ABOUT 

2739
01:35:55,382 --> 01:35:56,684
THE REPORTING ON FRIDAY, AND 

2740
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:58,052
THIS IS EVERYDAY NOW IN 

2741
01:35:58,052 --> 01:36:00,787
WASHINGTON, AND WE ARE ALL 

2742
01:36:00,787 --> 01:36:01,588
ACCUSTOMED TO IT, AND EVERYONE 

2743
01:36:01,588 --> 01:36:02,656
OVER ON CAPITOL HILL, ALWAYS 

2744
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:04,158
SORT OF PREPARED FOR SOMETHING 

2745
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:06,026
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN, AND IT HAS 

2746
01:36:06,026 --> 01:36:08,796
NOT HAPPENED, AT LEAST NOT AS 

2747
01:36:08,796 --> 01:36:10,331
OF 12:38 EASTERN TIME, AND YOU 

2748
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:11,832
KNOW, WE WILL SEE WHETHER IT 

2749
01:36:11,832 --> 01:36:13,300
TRANSPIRES LATER IN THE DAY. 

2750
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:19,874
FOR NOW, AT LEAST, WE KNOW THAT 

2751
01:36:19,874 --> 01:36:21,775
ROSENSTEIN STILL HAS A JOB, AND 

2752
01:36:21,775 --> 01:36:23,444
EVERYTHING DESPITE THE TEST YOU 

2753
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:25,079
JUST HEARD IS STATUS NORMAL. 

2754
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:26,346
>> THAT IS NOT AN EMERGENCY. 

2755
01:36:26,346 --> 01:36:29,683
>> I FEEL LIKE THE TEST IS A 

2756
01:36:29,683 --> 01:36:32,486
METAPHOR FOR THE NEWS MEDIA. 

2757
01:36:32,486 --> 01:36:32,886
WE GOT EXCITED,. 

2758
01:36:32,886 --> 01:36:33,921
>> Reporter: WORKED UP ABOUT 

2759
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:36,957
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT 

2760
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:37,257
HAPPENING? 

2761
01:36:37,257 --> 01:36:37,457
YEAH. 

2762
01:36:37,457 --> 01:36:38,626
>> EVEN IF ROSENSTEIN IS NOT 

2763
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:41,061
FIRED OR RESIGN TODAY, I THINK 

2764
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:41,795
THE QUESTION GOES BACK TO 

2765
01:36:41,795 --> 01:36:45,132
CAPITOL HILL TO LAWMAKERS TO 

2766
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:49,203
ASK, YOU KNOW, WHETHER THEY DO 

2767
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:50,804
FEEL AN INCENTIVE TO THE FLOOR. 

2768
01:36:50,804 --> 01:36:53,807
THERE'S BEEN TALK OF IT FOR A 

2769
01:36:53,807 --> 01:36:55,643
YEAR, BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN 

2770
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:58,612
HYPOTHETICAL, TODAY IT COULD 

2771
01:36:58,612 --> 01:37:00,581
VERY WELL BE HYPOTHETICAL, BUT 

2772
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:03,317
SHOULD THERE BE PARAMETERS PUT 

2773
01:37:03,317 --> 01:37:04,652
IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE 

2774
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:05,419
PROTECTION OF THIS? 

2775
01:37:05,419 --> 01:37:09,023
>> EVERY TIME WE HAVE HAD A 

2776
01:37:09,023 --> 01:37:09,723
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION, THE 

2777
01:37:09,723 --> 01:37:11,125
PARAMETERS OF THAT HAVE BEEN 

2778
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:14,261
TWEAKED, AND EVERY TIME, AS WE 

2779
01:37:14,261 --> 01:37:15,896
MOVED FORWARD, THE NEW 

2780
01:37:15,896 --> 01:37:16,730
INCARNATION IS REALLY AN 

2781
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:18,399
EXPERIMENT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS 

2782
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:19,834
UNDER THE NEW PRESSURES, YOU 

2783
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:20,034
KNOW? 

2784
01:37:20,034 --> 01:37:21,235
>> Reporter: RIGHT, AND THAT'S 

2785
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:22,703
WHY THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF, 

2786
01:37:22,703 --> 01:37:24,305
YOU KNOW, YOU BEEN HEARING A 

2787
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:25,539
LOT FROM THE REPUBLICAN ALLIES 

2788
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:27,107
FOR THE PRESIDENT AND FROM THE 

2789
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:30,077
PRESIDENT HIMSELF, CALLING IT 

2790
01:37:30,077 --> 01:37:33,147
ILLEGAL. úIT'S NOT ILLEGAL, AND 

2791
01:37:33,147 --> 01:37:34,214
HAVE BEEN INSTANCES, AND PAULA 

2792
01:37:34,214 --> 01:37:37,084
CAN SPEAK TO IT BETTER THAN I 

2793
01:37:37,084 --> 01:37:38,919
CAN, BUT THERE'S THE CONCERN 

2794
01:37:38,919 --> 01:37:41,121
THE PROBE HAS THE MANDATE TO 

2795
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:42,489
GROW AND GO WHEREVER THE 

2796
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:45,225
INVESTIGATION MAY LEAD. 

2797
01:37:45,225 --> 01:37:46,527
THAT HAS, OF COURSE, BEEN THE 

2798
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:47,828
OVERARCHING CONCERN FROM A 

2799
01:37:47,828 --> 01:37:49,496
POLITICAL FRONT, KNOWING IT'S 

2800
01:37:49,496 --> 01:37:49,763
POSSIBLE. 

2801
01:37:49,763 --> 01:37:51,498
>> THAT HAS OFTEN BEEN THE 

2802
01:37:51,498 --> 01:37:52,900
REACTION TO THE PROBES THAT 

2803
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:54,168
WERE TOO LIMITED IN THEIR 

2804
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:54,401
SCOPE. 

2805
01:37:54,401 --> 01:37:56,069
YOU COULD NOT GO BEYOND THAT. 

2806
01:37:56,069 --> 01:37:58,339
NOW WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, 

2807
01:37:58,339 --> 01:38:02,376
SOMETHING THAT IS ABLE TO SPORT 

2808
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:04,178
OF SPRAWL, AND IT HAS, I MEAN 

2809
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:05,813
IN TERMS OF THE MUELLER 

2810
01:38:05,813 --> 01:38:06,747
SUCCESSES SO FAR, HAVE HAD 

2811
01:38:06,747 --> 01:38:09,450
NOTHING TO DO WITH COLLUSION AT 

2812
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:09,750
THIS POINT. 

2813
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:11,452
>> IT'S ALSO NOT BEEN A WITCH 

2814
01:38:11,452 --> 01:38:12,519
HUNT, AND THAT'S THE QUESTION I 

2815
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:14,955
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STILL 

2816
01:38:14,955 --> 01:38:18,492
GOING TO HAVE, AND YOU RAISED 

2817
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:20,294
AN EXCELLENT POINT, IF AT ANY 

2818
01:38:20,294 --> 01:38:22,196
POINT IN TIME THE MEDIA AND 

2819
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:23,464
OTHERS RECKLESSLY REPORT WHAT 

2820
01:38:23,464 --> 01:38:24,798
IS HAPPENING WITH THE PERSON 

2821
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:26,667
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 

2822
01:38:26,667 --> 01:38:28,402
ELECTION, WHY NOT INTRODUCE A 

2823
01:38:28,402 --> 01:38:29,303
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT 

2824
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:30,738
REMOVES THE DOUBT AND REMOVES 

2825
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:32,072
ALL QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER OR 

2826
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:33,640
NOT IT WILL PROCEED, NO MATTER 

2827
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:36,143
WHAT THE PRESIDENT TWEETS OR 

2828
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:36,910
WHAT HE SAYS. 

2829
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:39,813
FINALLY TO YOU PAULA, IF THIS, 

2830
01:38:39,813 --> 01:38:40,981
IF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL 

2831
01:38:40,981 --> 01:38:43,250
RESIGNS OR IS FIRED OR 

2832
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:44,385
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HIM, WHO 

2833
01:38:44,385 --> 01:38:45,519
GETS THAT INVESTIGATION? 

2834
01:38:45,519 --> 01:38:49,990
WE HAVE OFTEN -- AND THIS IS A 

2835
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:51,125
QUESTION WE ASKED RIKKI 

2836
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:52,159
KLIEMAN, THERE'S OTHER 

2837
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:52,893
INVESTIGATIONS THAT WILL 

2838
01:38:52,893 --> 01:38:54,962
CONTINUE, WHETHER OR NOT ROBERT 

2839
01:38:54,962 --> 01:38:55,929
MUELLER IS IN HIS JOB. 

2840
01:38:55,929 --> 01:38:57,430
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. 

2841
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:58,332
I WILL GIVE YOU FRESH 

2842
01:38:58,332 --> 01:38:59,800
REPORTING, AND THEN WE WILL GO 

2843
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,002
TO THE LINE OF SUCCESSION. 

2844
01:39:02,002 --> 01:39:04,038
I AM TOLD THAT PRIOR TO THIS 

2845
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:05,940
MEETING THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN IS 

2846
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,375
IN, HE DID MEET WITH GENERAL 

2847
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:09,609
KELLY -- 

2848
01:39:09,609 --> 01:39:10,444
>> PRIOR? 

2849
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:13,213
>> YES, AND HE'S CURRENTLY AT A 

2850
01:39:13,213 --> 01:39:14,348
PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED MEETING AS 

2851
01:39:14,348 --> 01:39:15,949
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND I 

2852
01:39:15,949 --> 01:39:17,985
SAID DOES THIS MEAN HE'S NOT 

2853
01:39:17,985 --> 01:39:20,087
FIRED OR IS THERE A COMMITTEE 

2854
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:20,854
MEETING, AND ALL JUSTICE 

2855
01:39:20,854 --> 01:39:25,092
OFFICIALS SAY HE IS STILL THE 

2856
01:39:25,092 --> 01:39:25,625
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL. 

2857
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:26,827
GOOD TIME, BUT I THINK WE CAN 

2858
01:39:26,827 --> 01:39:29,730
TELL FROM THIS MORNING, HIS JOB 

2859
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:31,432
STATUS IS PERHAPS NOT 100% 

2860
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:33,667
SECURE, NOR IS IT EVER. 

2861
01:39:33,667 --> 01:39:35,135
>> CHECK THE TIME STAMP, 12:42. 

2862
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:36,370
>> THAT'S THE BEST INFORMATION 

2863
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:39,006
FROM INSIDE OF THE JUSTICE 

2864
01:39:39,006 --> 01:39:39,306
DEPARTMENT. 

2865
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:40,641
NOW IF ROD ROSENSTEIN SHOULD NO 

2866
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:42,509
LONGER BE EMPLOYED BY THE END 

2867
01:39:42,509 --> 01:39:43,677
OF THE DAY, THE BIG QUESTION, 

2868
01:39:43,677 --> 01:39:46,847
WHO TAKING OVER THE SPECIAL 

2869
01:39:46,847 --> 01:39:47,347
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION? 

2870
01:39:47,347 --> 01:39:49,049
TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT ON THIS 

2871
01:39:49,049 --> 01:39:49,349
RIGHT NOW. 

2872
01:39:49,349 --> 01:39:50,451
ONE, GO THROUGH THE LINE OF 

2873
01:39:50,451 --> 01:39:52,553
SUCCESSION AT THE JUSTICE 

2874
01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:52,853
DEPARTMENT. 

2875
01:39:52,853 --> 01:39:55,589
THERE'S ALWAYS THE CONCERN AN 

2876
01:39:55,589 --> 01:39:56,790
OFFICIAL COULD DIE OR THE 

2877
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:58,725
NUMBER THREE PERSON WENT TO WAL-

2878
01:39:58,725 --> 01:39:59,993
MART. 

2879
01:39:59,993 --> 01:40:00,861
WHO TAKES OVER? 

2880
01:40:00,861 --> 01:40:02,029
IT WOULD FALL TO NOAH 

2881
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:02,329
FRANCISCO. 

2882
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:03,464
PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE 

2883
01:40:03,464 --> 01:40:04,731
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT A LOT OF 

2884
01:40:04,731 --> 01:40:05,899
PEOPLE HAVE RESIGNED, AND 

2885
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:08,068
THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF HEADS OF 

2886
01:40:08,068 --> 01:40:10,637
DEPARTMENTS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN 

2887
01:40:10,637 --> 01:40:11,472
CONFIRMED. 

2888
01:40:11,472 --> 01:40:12,372
THAT'S UNUSUAL IN THAT SENSE, 

2889
01:40:12,372 --> 01:40:13,507
BUT FRANCISCO WOULD BE EXPECTED 

2890
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:14,741
TO TAKE IT OVER. 

2891
01:40:14,741 --> 01:40:15,976
>> HE'S BEEN CONFIRMED? 

2892
01:40:15,976 --> 01:40:18,946
>> HE HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, AND 

2893
01:40:18,946 --> 01:40:21,281
HE IS QUITE THE CHARACTER, 

2894
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:23,083
BRILLIANT LEGAL CAREER, AND WE 

2895
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:24,952
HAVE ASKED HIM NUMEROUS TIMES 

2896
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:26,653
IF HE WOULD FIRE MUELLER. 

2897
01:40:26,653 --> 01:40:28,021
HE ALWAYS CHOOSES TO IGNORE MY 

2898
01:40:28,021 --> 01:40:29,289
QUESTIONS, AND HE WOULD BE THE 

2899
01:40:29,289 --> 01:40:31,325
ONE EXPECTED TO TAKE OVER, BUT 

2900
01:40:31,325 --> 01:40:32,659
A CAVEAT HERE, PEOPLE SUGGEST 

2901
01:40:32,659 --> 01:40:34,862
TODAY THE PRESIDENT COULD TRY 

2902
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:36,697
TO USE THE VACANCIES REFORM ACT 

2903
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:38,866
TO NAME HIS SUCCESSOR, BUT 

2904
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:39,933
OTHERS SAY NO WAY, THE 

2905
01:40:39,933 --> 01:40:41,101
VACANCIES REFORM ACT WAS NOT 

2906
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:43,370
MEANT FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

2907
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:44,671
UNITED STATES TO REPLACE 

2908
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:46,073
SOMEONE OVERSEEING AN 

2909
01:40:46,073 --> 01:40:47,674
INVESTIGATION INTO THE 

2910
01:40:47,674 --> 01:40:49,510
PRESIDENT AND HIS ASSOCIATES, 

2911
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:50,777
AND IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY, IF HE 

2912
01:40:50,777 --> 01:40:52,346
DOESN'T GO THROUGH THE LINE OF 

2913
01:40:52,346 --> 01:40:53,780
SUCCESSION, IT WOULD SET OFF A 

2914
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:54,381
LEGAL CHALLENGE. 

2915
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:56,984
>> I LOVE OUR REPORTERS, AND

BECAUSE, AMIDST ALL OF THIS, WE

01:41:29,116 --> 01:41:31,251
ARE STILL WAITING TO SEE WHAT 

2938
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:32,753

2939
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:33,987

PROTEST HAPPENING LIVE AS WE

SPEAK, AND IT LOOKS LIKE, IT 

2943
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:43,797
LOOKS LIKE AN OLDER WOMAN WHO 

2944
01:41:43,797 --> 01:41:46,667
HAS GOT BINDERS ON HER WRIST, I 

2945
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:47,266
GUESS BEING DETAINED. 

2946
01:41:47,266 --> 01:41:48,802
>> IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TODAY 

2947
01:41:48,802 --> 01:41:50,604
WE WERE GOING TO HEAR FROM 

2948
01:41:50,604 --> 01:41:51,772
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND DR. FORD, 

2949
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:53,373

THURSDAY, AND SO, YOU KNOW, WHO 

2951
01:41:56,109 --> 01:41:57,144
KNOWS, PERHAPS THE PROTESTERS 

2952
01:41:57,144 --> 01:41:59,346
THOUGHT THEY WERE PROTESTING IN 

2953
01:41:59,346 --> 01:42:00,614
THE MIDST OF THE KAVANAUGH 

2954
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:02,583

A NUMBER OF PROTESTERS WHEN HIS 

2956
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:07,654
HEARING FIRST BEGAN. 

2957
01:42:07,654 --> 01:42:09,256
>>> ALL RIGHT, MEANWHILE, 

2958
01:42:09,256 --> 01:42:10,891
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL 

2959
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:12,793

ALLEGATIONS. 

2962
01:42:14,227 --> 01:42:15,896
>> HE WEIGHED IN ON THE 

2963
01:42:15,896 --> 01:42:17,631
CONTROVERSY ARRIVING IN NEW 

2964
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:20,134
YORK CITY TO ATTEND THE UNITED 

2965
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:20,800
NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY. 

2966
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:28,575
>> HE IS A FINE MAN WITH AN 

2967
01:42:28,575 --> 01:42:36,750
UNBLEMISHED  PAST, AND THESE 

2968
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:37,551
ARE HIGHLY UNSUBSTANTIATED 

2969
01:42:37,551 --> 01:42:38,552
ALLEGATIONS FROM LAWYERS, AND 

2970
01:42:38,552 --> 01:42:40,053
YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO THE 

2971
01:42:40,053 --> 01:42:41,855
LAWYERS DOING THE ALLEGATIONS, 

2972
01:42:41,855 --> 01:42:43,123
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS AN 

2973
01:42:43,123 --> 01:42:44,224
OUTSTANDING PERSON, AND I AM 

2974
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:45,325
WITH HIM ALL THE WAY. 

2975
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:46,693
WE WILL SEE HOW IT GOES WITH 

2976
01:42:46,693 --> 01:42:49,262
THE SENATE AND THE VOTE. 

2977
01:42:49,262 --> 01:42:50,731
I THINK IT COULD BE -- THERE'S 

2978
01:42:50,731 --> 01:42:53,800
A CHANCE IT COULD BE ONE OF THE 

2979
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,903
SINGLE MOST UNFAIR, UNJUST 

2980
01:42:55,903 --> 01:42:57,738
THINGS TO HAPPEN TO A CANDIDATE 

2981
01:42:57,738 --> 01:42:59,840
FOR ANYTHING, BUT I AM WITH 

2982
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,778
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, AND I LOOK 

2983
01:43:04,778 --> 01:43:06,179
FORWARD TO A VOTE, AND FOR 

2984
01:43:06,179 --> 01:43:08,615
PEOPLE TO COME OUT OF THE 

2985
01:43:08,615 --> 01:43:10,250
WOODWORKS FROM 36 YEARS AGO, 30 

2986
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:12,052
YEARS AGO, AND NEVER MENTION IT 

2987
01:43:12,052 --> 01:43:15,021
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT HAPPENS? 

2988
01:43:15,021 --> 01:43:16,289
IN MY OPINION, IT'S TOTALLY 

2989
01:43:16,289 --> 01:43:16,690
POLITICAL. 

2990
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:17,558
IT'S TOTALLY POLITICAL. 

2991
01:43:20,427 --> 01:43:23,330
>> ALL RIGHT, AND THE 

2992
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:24,498

01:45:29,923 --> 01:45:31,824
BUT SHE'S PREPARED TO TESTIFY. 

3062

3063

SHE'S BEING CAREFUL TO MAKE

01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:36,730
SURE THE PROCESS WILL BE FAIR, 

3065
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:39,499
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S TOO 

3066
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:42,469
MUCH TO ASK.

NANCY CORDES IS WITH US FROM 

3070
01:45:47,641 --> 01:45:48,275
CAPITOL HILL. 

3071
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:50,043
HOW WILL THE NEW ALLEGATIONS 

3072
01:45:50,043 --> 01:45:53,280
AFFECT THE THURSDAY SCHEDULED 

3073
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,582
MEETING WITH KAVANAUGH AND 

3074
01:45:55,582 --> 01:45:56,082
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD? 

3075
01:45:56,082 --> 01:45:56,583
>> Reporter: EXCELLENT 

3076
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:56,950
QUESTION, VLAD. 

3077
01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:58,852
WE KNOW SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS 

3078
01:45:58,852 --> 01:46:01,754
ARE ARGUING THAT THE HEARING 

3079
01:46:01,754 --> 01:46:03,123
SHOULD BE DELAYED, AND WE KNOW 

3080
01:46:03,123 --> 01:46:05,425
FOR DAYS THEY WERE CALLING FOR 

3081
01:46:05,425 --> 01:46:07,961
AN FBI INVESTIGATION, AND THE 

3082
01:46:07,961 --> 01:46:11,231
CALLS DROPPED OFF SOMEWHAT 

3083
01:46:11,231 --> 01:46:12,466
BECAUSE THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY 

3084
01:46:12,466 --> 01:46:13,500
HITTING A BRICK WALL, AND THE 

3085
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,435
WHITE HOUSE WOULD NOT ASK THE 

3086
01:46:15,435 --> 01:46:17,204
FBI TO DO AN INVESTIGATION, AND 

3087
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:18,805
NOW THERE'S A SECOND POTENTIAL 

3088
01:46:18,805 --> 01:46:20,507
VICTIM HERE, AND THE CALLS ARE 

3089
01:46:20,507 --> 01:46:22,642
BEING DRUMMED UP AGAIN, AND SO, 

3090
01:46:22,642 --> 01:46:24,010
THEY SAY, LOOK, YOU HAVE GOT 

3091
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:27,481
TWO WOMEN, AND THEY ARE, OF 

3092
01:46:27,481 --> 01:46:28,248
COURSE, ALLEGATIONS ABOUT 

3093
01:46:28,248 --> 01:46:30,517
THINGS THAT HAPPENED 35 YEARS 

3094
01:46:30,517 --> 01:46:31,952
AGO, YES, MEMORIES ARE SPOTTY, 

3095
01:46:31,952 --> 01:46:36,323
BUT CLEARLY THE FBI NEEDS TO 

3096
01:46:36,323 --> 01:46:36,723
LOOK INTO THIS. 

3097
01:46:36,723 --> 01:46:38,825
IN FACT, RAMIREZ SAID HERSELF, 

3098
01:46:38,825 --> 01:46:40,193
SHE THINKS THE FBI SHOULD LOOK 

3099
01:46:40,193 --> 01:46:40,493
INTO IT. 

3100
01:46:40,493 --> 01:46:42,662
THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

3101
01:46:42,662 --> 01:46:42,895
SAYING. 

3102
01:46:42,895 --> 01:46:43,830
PUSH OFF FORD'S HEARING ON 

3103
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:45,198
THURSDAY, AND LOOK INTO THE 

3104
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:46,132
ALLEGATIONS, AND SO FAR WE HAVE 

3105
01:46:46,132 --> 01:46:48,502
NOT HEARD MUCH OF A RESPONSE 

3106
01:46:48,502 --> 01:46:49,636
FROM THE REPUBLICANS, AND THEY 

3107
01:46:49,636 --> 01:46:53,106
HAVE BEEN QUITE  QUIET. 

3108
01:46:53,106 --> 01:46:54,574
YOU GET THE SENSE THAT SOME OF 

3109
01:46:54,574 --> 01:46:56,176
THEM ARE WATCHING TO SEE IF 

3110
01:46:56,176 --> 01:46:57,811
KAVANAUGH CAN WEATHER THE 

3111
01:46:57,811 --> 01:46:58,044
STORM. 

3112
01:46:58,044 --> 01:46:59,980
OTHERS PERHAPS WANT TO MEET 

3113
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:02,249
TODAY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE 

3114
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:03,182
BEST WAY FORWARD IS. 

3115
01:47:03,182 --> 01:47:05,385
DO THEY CONTINUE TO FIGHT ON 

3116
01:47:05,385 --> 01:47:06,286
MULTIPLE FRONTS AND URGE 

3117
01:47:06,286 --> 01:47:07,887
KAVANAUGH TO DO THE SAME? 

3118
01:47:07,887 --> 01:47:11,358
URGE HIM TO TESTIFY ON THURSDAY 

3119
01:47:11,358 --> 01:47:12,325
AND VIGOROUSLY DEFEND HIMSELF, 

3120
01:47:12,325 --> 01:47:15,629
OR DO THEY DECIDE THAT WITH TWO 

3121
01:47:15,629 --> 01:47:17,097
ALLEGATIONS ALREADY OUT THERE, 

3122
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:19,933
AND A THIRD LOOMING, BECAUSE, 

3123
01:47:19,933 --> 01:47:22,302
REMEMBER, MICHAEL AVENATTI, OF 

3124
01:47:22,302 --> 01:47:24,104
COURSE THE LAWYER FOR PORN STAR 

3125

STORMY DANIELS, HE SAYS HE NOW 

3126
01:47:26,806 --> 01:47:27,974
HAS A CREDIBLE WITNESS, READY 

3127
01:47:27,974 --> 01:47:29,976
TO COME FORWARD AND TELL HER 

3128
01:47:29,976 --> 01:47:30,209
STORY. 

3129
01:47:30,209 --> 01:47:32,312
WHAT ARE REPUBLICANS GOING TO 

3130
01:47:32,312 --> 01:47:33,913
DO ABOUT THAT INFORMATION? 

3131
01:47:33,913 --> 01:47:34,948
THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE 

3132
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:37,183
HAS RIGHT NOW, AND WE JUST HAVE 

3133
01:47:37,183 --> 01:47:39,419
TO WAIT AND SEE TODAY WHETHER 

3134
01:47:39,419 --> 01:47:40,554
THEY DECIDE IT'S ALL TOO MUCH, 

3135
01:47:40,554 --> 01:47:43,456
AND THEY JUST NEED TO CUT THEIR 

3136
01:47:43,456 --> 01:47:44,357
LOSSES AND URGE KAVANAUGH TO 

3137
01:47:44,357 --> 01:47:45,659
WITHDRAW, OR DO THEY STAND BY 

3138
01:47:45,659 --> 01:47:50,697
HIM AND TELL HIM TO FIGHT? 

3139
01:47:50,697 --> 01:47:54,401
>> NANCY, SPEAKING OF MICHAEL 

3140
01:47:54,401 --> 01:47:55,869
AVENATTI'S CLIENT, HE SPOKE TO 

3141
01:47:55,869 --> 01:47:58,572
CBS NEWS, DO YOU KNOW ANY MORE 

3142
01:47:58,572 --> 01:47:59,839
ABOUT THE THIRD ACCUSATION OF 

3143
01:47:59,839 --> 01:48:01,207
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND WHAT HE 

3144
01:48:01,207 --> 01:48:01,608
IS SAYING? 

3145
01:48:01,608 --> 01:48:02,642
>> Reporter: I SPOKE TO HIM 

3146
01:48:02,642 --> 01:48:04,511
LATE LAST NIGHT, AND HE SAID HE 

3147
01:48:04,511 --> 01:48:06,446
IS NOT SOMEONE WHO IS 

3148
01:48:06,446 --> 01:48:08,982
INTERESTED IN TRAFFICKING IN 

3149
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:09,215
RUMORS. 

3150
01:48:09,215 --> 01:48:12,552
HE HAS A VERY CREDIBLE CLIENT 

3151
01:48:12,552 --> 01:48:14,387
AND HE  SAID SHE IS GOING TO 

3152
01:48:14,387 --> 01:48:16,790
COME FORWARD AND TELL HER STORY 

3153
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:17,090
THIS WEEK. 

3154
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:18,325
BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN 

3155
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:19,759
HIS TWEETS AND AN E-MAIL HE 

3156
01:48:19,759 --> 01:48:22,462
SENT TO REPUBLICANS ON THE 

3157
01:48:22,462 --> 01:48:23,463
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, HIS 

3158
01:48:23,463 --> 01:48:26,433
CLIENT IS GOING TO SPEAK TO 

3159
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:29,035
INCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED IN HIGH 

3160
01:48:29,035 --> 01:48:29,869
SCHOOL, AND ACCORDING TO 

3161
01:48:29,869 --> 01:48:34,574
AVENATTI, IT HAS TO DO WITH A 

3162
01:48:34,574 --> 01:48:36,343
NUMBER OF BOYS, INCLUDING 

3163
01:48:36,343 --> 01:48:38,912
KAVANAUGH, WHO WOULD GET YOUNG 

3164
01:48:38,912 --> 01:48:39,946
WOMEN DRUNK, INTENTIONALLY, AT 

3165
01:48:39,946 --> 01:48:41,881
PARTIES ON THE WEEKENDS, AND 

3166
01:48:41,881 --> 01:48:43,216
THEN ATTEMPT TO SEXUALLY 

3167
01:48:43,216 --> 01:48:43,616
ASSAULT THEM. 

3168
01:48:43,616 --> 01:48:48,054
THAT'S BASED ON WHAT HE HAS 

3169
01:48:48,054 --> 01:48:49,689
SAID PUBLICALLY IN TWEETS AND E-

3170
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:54,527
MAILS TO THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

3171
01:48:54,527 --> 01:48:54,928
COMMITTEE. 

3172
01:48:54,928 --> 01:48:55,595
REPUBLICANS ARE SCEPTICAL. 

3173
01:48:55,595 --> 01:48:56,997
THEY KNOW AVENATTI HAS BEEN 

3174
01:48:56,997 --> 01:48:58,031
REPRESENTING ONE OF THE 

3175
01:48:58,031 --> 01:48:59,265
PRESIDENT'S BIGGEST FOES, AND 

3176
01:48:59,265 --> 01:49:01,968
SO, THEY SAY, LET'S JUST WAIT 

3177
01:49:01,968 --> 01:49:07,240
AND SEE WHAT HE ACTUALLY HAS 

3178
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:08,575
BEFORE WE MAKE SOME DECISIONS, 

3179
01:49:08,575 --> 01:49:10,776
BUT THERE IS CERTAINLY A LOT OF 

3180
01:49:10,776 --> 01:49:11,778
INTRIGUE ON CAPITOL HILL ABOUT 

3181
01:49:11,778 --> 01:49:13,013
WHO EXACTLY THE ACCUSER IS AND 

3182
01:49:13,013 --> 01:49:18,084
WHEN WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM 

3183
01:49:18,084 --> 01:49:18,385
THEM. 

3184
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:19,552
AVENATTI HAS NOT SAID 

3185
01:49:19,552 --> 01:49:20,320
DEFINITIVELY WHEN, WHAT DAY, 

3186
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,155
THE ACCUSER IS GOING TO GO 

3187
01:49:22,155 --> 01:49:25,424
PUBLIC AND TELL HER STORY. 

3188
01:49:25,424 --> 01:49:26,426
>> NANCY, SOMETHING ELSE, I 

3189
01:49:26,426 --> 01:49:30,263
DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS BURIED IN 

3190
01:49:30,263 --> 01:49:31,531
THE STORY, BUT IT'S INTRIGUING. 

3191
01:49:31,531 --> 01:49:33,800
IN THE NEW YORKER ARTICLE BY 

3192
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:34,868
FARROW AND MAYER, THEY SUGGEST 

3193
01:49:34,868 --> 01:49:38,805
THE WHITE HOUSE AND SENATE 

3194
01:49:38,805 --> 01:49:40,040
REPUBLICANS WERE WORRIED ABOUT 

3195
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:40,674
RONAN FARROW'S STORY DROPPING 

3196
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:42,509
AND THEY KNEW OF THE 

3197
01:49:42,509 --> 01:49:43,343
ALLEGATIONS BEFORE THE STORY 

3198
01:49:43,343 --> 01:49:45,011
WAS POSTED LAST NIGHT, AND WHAT 

3199
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:47,080
ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT THAT? 

3200
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,481
>> Reporter: WELL, REPUBLICANS 

3201
01:49:48,481 --> 01:49:50,116
ARE DENYING THAT THEY KNEW 

3202
01:49:50,116 --> 01:49:52,085
ANYTHING ABOUT THESE 

3203
01:49:52,085 --> 01:49:53,620
ALLEGATIONS, BUT THAT IS TRULY 

3204
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:54,921
HARD TO BELIEVE, VLAD, BECAUSE, 

3205
01:49:54,921 --> 01:49:56,823
WE WERE HEARING ALL KINDS OF 

3206
01:49:56,823 --> 01:49:58,925
RUMORS OVER THE PAST WEEK, AND 

3207
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:01,194
YOU KNOW THAT IF REPORTERS WERE 

3208
01:50:01,194 --> 01:50:02,829
HEARING THE RUMORS, IF 

3209
01:50:02,829 --> 01:50:05,432
DEMOCRATS ON THE JUDICIARY 

3210
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:06,299
COMMITTEE WERE HEARING THE 

3211
01:50:06,299 --> 01:50:07,534
RUMORS, THE NOTION THAT THE 

3212
01:50:07,534 --> 01:50:08,535
REPUBLICANS WERE COMPLETELY IN 

3213
01:50:08,535 --> 01:50:10,937
THE DARK AND DIDN'T HEAR 

3214
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:12,072
ANYTHING, IT JUST ISN'T THAT 

3215
01:50:12,072 --> 01:50:13,907
BELIEVABLE, FRANKLY, AND I MEAN 

3216
01:50:13,907 --> 01:50:15,108
IT'S ALL ANYBODY ON THE 

3217
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:17,110
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS BEEN 

3218
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:18,778
THINKING ABOUT, AND THE IDEA 

3219
01:50:18,778 --> 01:50:22,082
THAT THEY WEREN'T HEARING THE 

3220
01:50:22,082 --> 01:50:24,250
RUMORS IS JUST HARD TO SWALLOW, 

3221
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:27,087
AND WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING, 

3222
01:50:27,087 --> 01:50:27,854
REPUBLICANS ABSOLUTELY HEARD 

3223
01:50:27,854 --> 01:50:29,022
THE RUMORS, AND THAT'S WHY 

3224
01:50:29,022 --> 01:50:30,523
SUDDENLY TOWARDS THE END OF THE 

3225
01:50:30,523 --> 01:50:32,025

01:59:08,607 --> 01:59:10,042
THE MAN OVERSEEING THE DEPUTY 

3406
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:12,845
PROBE, ROD ROSENSTEIN WILL MEET 

3407
01:59:12,845 --> 01:59:16,382
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP ON 

3408
01:59:16,382 --> 01:59:16,649
THURSDAY. 

3409
01:59:16,649 --> 01:59:18,050
A MEETING SET OFF RAMPANT 

3410
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:24,757
SPECULATION ABOUT HIS FATE. 

3411
01:59:24,757 --> 01:59:26,091
THE REASON? 

3412
01:59:26,091 --> 01:59:28,327
FRIDAY'S BOMBSHELL REPORT THAT 

3413
01:59:28,327 --> 01:59:29,795
HE TALKED ABOUT SECRETLY 

3414
01:59:29,795 --> 01:59:31,330
RECORDING THE PRESIDENT, AND 

3415
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:34,100
INVOKING THE 25th AMENDMENT TO 

3416
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:36,269
REMOVE THE PRESIDENT. 

3417
01:59:36,269 --> 01:59:37,336
ROSENSTEIN CALLED THE STORY 

3418
01:59:37,336 --> 01:59:38,304
INACCURATE, AND FACTUALLY 

3419
01:59:38,304 --> 01:59:38,604
INCORRECT. 

3420
01:59:38,604 --> 01:59:39,805
HE ALSO SAID ON HIS PERSONAL 

3421
01:59:39,805 --> 01:59:41,207
DEALINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT, 

3422
01:59:41,207 --> 01:59:43,075
THERE IS QUOTE NO BASIS TO 

3423
01:59:43,075 --> 01:59:44,010
INVOKE THE 25th AMENDMENT. 

3424
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:44,710
WE SHOULD NOTE THE PRESIDENT IS 

3425
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:46,012
NOT AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

3426
01:59:46,012 --> 01:59:47,913
HE IS IN NEW YORK CITY. 

3427
01:59:47,913 --> 01:59:49,915
BUT IN A RADIO INTERVIEW THAT 

3428
01:59:49,915 --> 01:59:50,850
AIRED THIS MORNING, THE 

3429
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:53,919
PRESIDENT WAS ASKED WHETHER OR 

3430
01:59:53,919 --> 01:59:55,053
NOT HE WOULD FIRE ROSENSTEIN. 

3431
01:59:55,053 --> 01:59:58,658
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S A VERY 

3432
01:59:58,658 --> 01:59:59,759
SAD STORY, AND PEOPLE ARE 

3433
01:59:59,759 --> 02:00:01,727
OBVIOUSLY, WE ARE LOOKING INTO 

3434
02:00:01,727 --> 02:00:04,197
IT, BUT IT'S A VERY SAD STATE 

3435
02:00:04,197 --> 02:00:05,665
OF AFFAIRS WHEN SOMETHING LIKE 

3436
02:00:05,665 --> 02:00:06,065
THAT CAN HAPPEN. 

3437
02:00:06,065 --> 02:00:08,467
I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT ON IT 

3438
02:00:08,467 --> 02:00:10,703
UNTIL I GET ALL OF THE FACTS, I 

3439
02:00:10,703 --> 02:00:11,904
HAVEN'T GOTTEN ALL OF THE 

3440
02:00:11,904 --> 02:00:14,507
FACTS, BUT CERTAINLY IT'S BEING 

3441
02:00:14,507 --> 02:00:16,642
LOOKED AT IN TERMS OF WHAT TOOK 

3442
02:00:16,642 --> 02:00:19,378
PLACE, IF ANYTHING TOOK PLACE, 

3443
02:00:19,378 --> 02:00:20,212
AND I'LL MAKE A DETERMINATION 

3444
02:00:20,212 --> 02:00:22,348
SOMETIME LATER, BUT I DON'T 

3445
02:00:22,348 --> 02:00:23,049
HAVE THE FACTS. 

3446
02:00:23,049 --> 02:00:25,484
>> KEN THOMAS IS IN WASHINGTON. 

3447
02:00:25,484 --> 02:00:26,986
HE'S A WHITE HOUSE 

3448
02:00:26,986 --> 02:00:30,089
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE 

3449
02:00:30,089 --> 02:00:32,358
ASSOCIATED PRESS, CAITLYN HUEY 

3450
02:00:32,358 --> 02:00:33,092
BURNS IS A CBSN POLITICAL 

3451
02:00:33,092 --> 02:00:34,660
REPORTER, AND PAULA REID IS 

3452
02:00:34,660 --> 02:00:35,360
ALSO HERE WITH US. 

3453
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:36,962
THANKS TO EVERYONE FOR BEING 

3454
02:00:36,962 --> 02:00:37,229
WITH US. 

3455
02:00:37,229 --> 02:00:38,497
THAT'S A LOT TO DISCUSS. 

3456
02:00:38,497 --> 02:00:40,466
PAULA, LET'S START WITH YOU. 

3457
02:00:40,466 --> 02:00:42,702
WE DO KNOW THAT ROSENSTEIN WAS 

3458
02:00:42,702 --> 02:00:44,970
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, HAD A 

3459
02:00:44,970 --> 02:00:47,840
MEETING ALREADY, AND MOVED ONTO 

3460
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:48,307
ANOTHER MEETING. 

3461
02:00:48,307 --> 02:00:50,442
WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS TELL NEW. 

3462
02:00:50,442 --> 02:00:52,611
>> IT'S BEEN QUITE A MORNING. 

3463
02:00:52,611 --> 02:00:53,479
HE MET WITH CHIEF OF STAFF 

3464
02:00:53,479 --> 02:00:55,481
GENERAL KELLY, AND WE'RE TOLD 

3465
02:00:55,481 --> 02:00:56,114
HE WENT INTO THIS MEETING 

3466
02:00:56,114 --> 02:00:57,683
EXPECTING TO BE FIRED, BUT HE 

3467
02:00:57,683 --> 02:00:58,350
WAS NOT FIRED. 

3468
02:00:58,350 --> 02:01:01,554
HE THEN LEFT THAT MEETING TO GO 

3469
02:01:01,554 --> 02:01:03,722
TO A CABINET OFFICIAL MEETING. 

3470
02:01:03,722 --> 02:01:04,957
SOMETHING PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED, 

3471
02:01:04,957 --> 02:01:07,393
AND HE WAS ATTENDING THAT ON 

3472
02:01:07,393 --> 02:01:08,728
BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF 

3473
02:01:08,728 --> 02:01:08,994
SESSIONS. 

3474
02:01:08,994 --> 02:01:10,730
ONE THING I NEED TO POINT OUT 

3475
02:01:10,730 --> 02:01:11,831
RIGHT NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING 

3476
02:01:11,831 --> 02:01:14,100
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT RIGHT 

3477
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:16,268
NOW, WHICH IS KAVANAUGH. 

3478
02:01:16,268 --> 02:01:17,236
RIGHT NOW I'M ASKING MY 

3479
02:01:17,236 --> 02:01:23,876
SOURCES, WHETHER OR NOT ALL OF 

3480
02:01:23,876 --> 02:01:24,476
THIS, SUGGESTIONS ROSENSTEIN 

3481
02:01:24,476 --> 02:01:26,278
WAS GOING TO BE FIRED, WHETHER 

3482
02:01:26,278 --> 02:01:29,849
OR NOT THIS WAS PERHAPS AN 

3483
02:01:29,849 --> 02:01:30,483
INTENSAL DISTRACTION, BECAUSE 

3484
02:01:30,483 --> 02:01:31,483
HE WAS ALREADY SCHEDULED TO BE 

3485
02:01:31,483 --> 02:01:33,019
AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

3486
02:01:33,019 --> 02:01:33,952
I THINK WE JUST NEED TO 

3487
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:36,956
APPROACH ALL OF THIS WITH A 

3488
02:01:36,956 --> 02:01:38,758
LITTLE BIT OF SKEPTICISM. 

3489
02:01:38,758 --> 02:01:42,828
>> HE MAY NOT GET FIRED, AND HE 

3490
02:01:42,828 --> 02:01:43,929
MAY NOT RESIGN? 

3491
02:01:43,929 --> 02:01:44,964
>> HE'S STILL THE DEPUTY 

3492
02:01:44,964 --> 02:01:45,998
GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, 

3493
02:01:45,998 --> 02:01:48,300
AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE WILL BE 

3494
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:48,768
UNTIL THURSDAY. 

3495
02:01:48,768 --> 02:01:49,468
IT'S INTERESTING TO ME, HE WAS 

3496
02:01:49,468 --> 02:01:51,404
ALREADY EXPECTED TO BE AT THE 

3497
02:01:51,404 --> 02:01:52,738
WHITE HOUSE FOR A CABINET LEVEL 

3498
02:01:52,738 --> 02:01:54,073
MEETING, BUT ALL OF THESE 

3499
02:01:54,073 --> 02:01:55,307
REPORTS HAVE HELPED TO MOVE THE 

3500
02:01:55,307 --> 02:01:57,343
KAVANAUGH STORY TO THE SIDE OF 

3501
02:01:57,343 --> 02:01:57,509
IT. 

3502
02:01:57,509 --> 02:01:59,412
>> LOOK AT US, HERE WE ARE, 

3503
02:01:59,412 --> 02:02:01,747
TALKING ABOUT ROD ROSENSTEIN. 

3504
02:02:01,747 --> 02:02:06,419
KEN, WOULD IT MATTER WHETHER 

3505
02:02:06,419 --> 02:02:07,987
ROSENSTEIN IS FIRED, OR HE 

3506
02:02:07,987 --> 02:02:08,254
RESIGNS? 

3507
02:02:08,254 --> 02:02:10,389
ULTIMATELY, DOES THAT MAKE A 

3508
02:02:10,389 --> 02:02:10,689
DIFFERENCE? 

3509
02:02:10,689 --> 02:02:12,525
>> IT DOES IN BOTH THE SHORT 

3510
02:02:12,525 --> 02:02:13,359
TERM AND THE LONG TERM. 

3511
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:15,795
IF HE WAS FIRED, IT WOULD BE 

3512
02:02:15,795 --> 02:02:17,163
DIFFICULT FOR THE PRESIDENT TO 

3513
02:02:17,163 --> 02:02:19,832
NAME A REPLACEMENT OF HIS 

3514
02:02:19,832 --> 02:02:21,867
CHOICE, OF HIS LIKING UNDER THE 

3515
02:02:21,867 --> 02:02:22,234
VACANCIES ACT. 

3516
02:02:22,234 --> 02:02:26,505
HE WOULD HAVE LESS CONTROL OVER 

3517
02:02:26,505 --> 02:02:28,307
THE LINE OF SUCCESSION, IF 

3518
02:02:28,307 --> 02:02:29,442
ROSENSTEIN OFFERED TO RESIGN, 

3519
02:02:29,442 --> 02:02:30,776
THE PRESIDENT WOULD TEND TO 

3520
02:02:30,776 --> 02:02:35,080
HAVE MORE OF A LEEWAY TO DO 

3521
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:36,582
THAT, THAT WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO 

3522
02:02:36,582 --> 02:02:37,682
NOEL FRANCISCO, THE SOLICITOR 

3523
02:02:37,682 --> 02:02:39,385
GENERAL TAKING OVER THE ROLE. 

3524
02:02:39,385 --> 02:02:42,754
IN THE LONG TERM, THERE'S ALSO 

3525
02:02:42,754 --> 02:02:44,457
THIS ISSUE OF, IF ROSENSTEIN 

3526
02:02:44,457 --> 02:02:48,461
WAS FIRED, THAT MIGHT RAISE 

3527
02:02:48,461 --> 02:02:49,061
CONCERNS AMONG THE SPECIAL 

3528
02:02:49,061 --> 02:02:50,229
COUNSEL'S OFFICE THAT THE 

3529
02:02:50,229 --> 02:02:52,631
PRESIDENT COULD BE COMMITTING 

3530
02:02:52,631 --> 02:02:54,232
SOME SORT OF OBSTRUCTION HERE. 

3531
02:02:54,232 --> 02:02:55,834
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN WE 

3532
02:02:55,834 --> 02:03:00,139
FINALLY FIGURE THIS OUT, WHAT 

3533
02:03:00,139 --> 02:03:01,607
THE DISTINCTION WILL BE. 

3534
02:03:01,607 --> 02:03:04,977
>> WE JUST HEARD THAT NOEL 

3535
02:03:04,977 --> 02:03:05,678
FRANCISCO WOULD TAKE OVER, 

3536
02:03:05,678 --> 02:03:07,847
POTENTIALLY, IF ROSENSTEIN 

3537
02:03:07,847 --> 02:03:08,147
STEPS DOWN. 

3538
02:03:08,147 --> 02:03:09,515
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM? 

3539
02:03:09,515 --> 02:03:12,985
>> I THINK PAULA KNOWS HIM VERY 

3540
02:03:12,985 --> 02:03:13,285
WELL. 

3541
02:03:13,285 --> 02:03:14,053
>> YOU DO. 

3542
02:03:14,053 --> 02:03:15,220
>> SURE, YEAH, HE'S BEEN 

3543
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:18,123
SOMEONE I'VE ENCOUNTERED IN THE 

3544
02:03:18,123 --> 02:03:18,557
HALLS. 

3545
02:03:18,557 --> 02:03:21,594
I'M ALWAYS ASKING HIM EVERY 

3546
02:03:21,594 --> 02:03:23,929
TIME I SEE HIM SMOKING A CIGAR. 

3547
02:03:23,929 --> 02:03:25,698
WOULD YOU TAKE OVER FOR 

3548
02:03:25,698 --> 02:03:26,098
MUELLER? 

3549
02:03:26,098 --> 02:03:29,702
HE ALWAYS IGNORES ME. 

3550
02:03:29,702 --> 02:03:30,770
HE'S THE SOLICITOR GENERAL, AND 

3551
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:32,304
HANDLES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN 

3552
02:03:32,304 --> 02:03:33,739
FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT. 

3553
02:03:33,739 --> 02:03:34,339
IT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR THE 

3554
02:03:34,339 --> 02:03:38,844
SOLICITOR GENERAL TO BE IN THE 

3555
02:03:38,844 --> 02:03:39,445
LINE OF SUCCESSION. 

3556
02:03:39,445 --> 02:03:41,380
USUALLY YOU HAVE A NUMBER 1, A 

3557
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:43,349
NUMBER 2, AND A NUMBER 3. 

3558
02:03:43,349 --> 02:03:44,416
WHAT'S SO UNUSUAL AT THE 

3559
02:03:44,416 --> 02:03:45,718
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS NOW YOU 

3560
02:03:45,718 --> 02:03:48,821
HAVE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO 

3561
02:03:48,821 --> 02:03:49,488
HAS RECUSED HIMSELF. 

3562
02:03:49,488 --> 02:03:50,890
THE NUMBER THREE, RACHEL BRAND 

3563
02:03:50,890 --> 02:03:53,525
WENT ON TO WORK FOR WAL-MART. 

3564
02:03:53,525 --> 02:03:55,427
THAT'S HOW HE WOULD POSSIBLY 

3565
02:03:55,427 --> 02:03:58,063
INHERIT THE MUELLER 

3566
02:03:58,063 --> 02:03:58,430
INVESTIGATION. 

3567
02:03:58,430 --> 02:04:00,065
BUT IT'S UNCLEAR, EVEN BASED ON 

3568
02:04:00,065 --> 02:04:02,300
MY REPORTING OF HIM, WHETHER OR 

3569
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:04,136
NOT HE WOULD BE DEFERENTIAL TO 

3570
02:04:04,136 --> 02:04:05,671
THE PRESIDENT IN THOSE KEY 

3571
02:04:05,671 --> 02:04:05,971
DECISIONS. 

3572
02:04:05,971 --> 02:04:08,174
IF YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF THE 

3573
02:04:08,174 --> 02:04:09,875
MUELLER PROBE, NOT ONLY ARE YOU 

3574
02:04:09,875 --> 02:04:11,009
THE FINAL RUBBER STAMP, YOU ARE 

3575
02:04:11,009 --> 02:04:12,945
ALSO THE ONE WHO IS GOING TO 

3576
02:04:12,945 --> 02:04:13,912
MAKE THE FINAL DECISION. 

3577
02:04:13,912 --> 02:04:16,048
WHAT TO DO WITH THE BIG REPORT 

3578
02:04:16,048 --> 02:04:18,684
THAT MUELLER ISSUES AT THE END. 

3579
02:04:18,684 --> 02:04:19,418
WHICH ISN'T COMING ANYTIME 

3580
02:04:19,418 --> 02:04:21,220
SOON, LET ME TELL YOU. 

3581
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:23,322
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE IF 

3582
02:04:23,322 --> 02:04:24,457
THERE IS ANY CRIMINAL EVIDENCE 

3583
02:04:24,457 --> 02:04:25,190
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. 

3584
02:04:25,190 --> 02:04:27,026
DO YOU HAND IT OFF TO CONGRESS, 

3585
02:04:27,026 --> 02:04:28,894
DO YOU STICK IT  A DRAWER? 

3586
02:04:28,894 --> 02:04:30,628
THERE IS NO RULE FOR THAT. 

3587
02:04:30,628 --> 02:04:32,131
IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WHO 

3588
02:04:32,131 --> 02:04:34,099
IS IN THAT POSITION. 

3589
02:04:34,099 --> 02:04:37,569
>> IS THERE ANY INDICATION ON 

3590
02:04:37,569 --> 02:04:39,238
HOW NOEL FRANCISCO THINKS ABOUT 

3591
02:04:39,238 --> 02:04:39,538
THIS? 

3592
02:04:39,538 --> 02:04:44,310
>> NO, HE KEEPS IGNORING ME. 

3593
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:45,678
JUST SMOKES HIS CIGARS. 

3594
02:04:45,678 --> 02:04:46,979
>> TO PAULA'S EARLIER POINT, 

3595
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:47,746
THAT PERHAPS THIS IS A 

3596
02:04:47,746 --> 02:04:49,949
DISTRACTION COMING OUT OF THE 

3597
02:04:49,949 --> 02:04:50,615
WHITE HOUSE. 

3598
02:04:50,615 --> 02:04:52,918
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 

3599
02:04:52,918 --> 02:04:53,985
>> IT'S REALLY INTERESTING. 

3600
02:04:53,985 --> 02:04:56,455
IF IN FACT, ROSENSTEIN AT THE 

3601
02:04:56,455 --> 02:04:57,456
PRESIDENT MEET ON THURSDAY, AS 

3602
02:04:57,456 --> 02:04:58,390
SARAH SANDERS SAID THAT THEY 

3603
02:04:58,390 --> 02:05:00,059
WOULD DO, THAT ALSO HAPPENS TO 

3604
02:05:00,059 --> 02:05:03,028
BE THE DAY THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED 

3605
02:05:03,028 --> 02:05:04,329
TO HAVE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 

3606
02:05:04,329 --> 02:05:07,633
HEARING AT WHICH KAVANAUGH IS 

3607
02:05:07,633 --> 02:05:09,668
EXPECTED TO TESTIFY, AND 

3608
02:05:09,668 --> 02:05:11,470
NEGOTIATIONS ARE STILL UNDERWAY 

3609
02:05:11,470 --> 02:05:12,137
BETWEEN CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, 

3610
02:05:12,137 --> 02:05:13,506
WHO HAS ACCUSED KAVANAUGH OF 

3611
02:05:13,506 --> 02:05:15,140
SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND WHILE THEY 

3612
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:16,041
WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL, WHETHER 

3613
02:05:16,041 --> 02:05:17,943
SHE WILL IN FACT APPEAR AT THAT 

3614
02:05:17,943 --> 02:05:18,444
AS WELL. 

3615
02:05:18,444 --> 02:05:20,212
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR 

3616
02:05:20,212 --> 02:05:22,247
A DELAY IN LIGHT OF NEW 

3617
02:05:22,247 --> 02:05:22,981
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE SURFACED 

3618
02:05:22,981 --> 02:05:25,718
IN REPORTING FROM THE NEW 

3619
02:05:25,718 --> 02:05:26,051
YORKER. 

3620
02:05:26,051 --> 02:05:27,186
THAT'S WHERE YOU COULD HAVE 

3621
02:05:27,186 --> 02:05:28,587
THESE TWO STORYLINES COMING TO 

3622
02:05:28,587 --> 02:05:30,855
A HEAD, NONE OF WHICH WOULD BE 

3623
02:05:30,855 --> 02:05:33,225
GOOD FOR THE PRESIDENT 

3624
02:05:33,225 --> 02:05:33,558
POLITICALLY. 

3625
02:05:33,558 --> 02:05:34,159
WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING TO 

3626
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:37,997
CONSIDER, TOO, IS THE IDEA THAT 

3627
02:05:37,997 --> 02:05:41,100
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS HAD OPPOSED 

3628
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:42,001
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION TO BEGIN 

3629
02:05:42,001 --> 02:05:43,969
WITH, BECAUSE OF STATEMENTS 

3630
02:05:43,969 --> 02:05:46,372
THAT HE HAD MADE PREVIOUSLY 

3631
02:05:46,372 --> 02:05:50,009
ABOUT WHETHER THE PRESIDENT 

3632
02:05:50,009 --> 02:05:52,277
COULD BE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED 

3633
02:05:52,277 --> 02:05:53,745
AS IT RELATES TO AN 

3634
02:05:53,745 --> 02:05:54,112
INVESTIGATION. 

3635
02:05:54,112 --> 02:05:55,614
SO DEMOCRATS HAD RAISED A LOT 

3636
02:05:55,614 --> 02:05:57,149
OF CONCERNS ABOUT HOW KAVANAUGH 

3637
02:05:57,149 --> 02:05:58,283
WOULD RESPOND TO THAT. 

3638
02:05:58,283 --> 02:06:00,886
SO THERE YOU HAVE ALL THESE 

3639
02:06:00,886 --> 02:06:02,454
DIFFERENT KIND OF STORYLINES 

3640
02:06:02,454 --> 02:06:03,522
AND THREADS COMING TO A HEAD. 

3641
02:06:03,522 --> 02:06:03,889
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

3642
02:06:03,889 --> 02:06:06,925
I WANT TO TURN TO YOU NOW. 

3643
02:06:06,925 --> 02:06:10,696
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 

3644
02:06:10,696 --> 02:06:12,131
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SENIOR 

3645
02:06:12,131 --> 02:06:12,931
TRUMP OFFICIALS TO REACT. 

3646
02:06:12,931 --> 02:06:14,867
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT IT ON 

3647
02:06:14,867 --> 02:06:15,100
SUNDAY. 

3648
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:19,538
>> IF YOU CAN'T BE ON THE TEAM, 

3649
02:06:19,538 --> 02:06:20,973
IF YOU'RE NOT SUPPORTING THIS 

3650
02:06:20,973 --> 02:06:22,107
MISSION, THEN MAYBE YOU JUST 

3651
02:06:22,107 --> 02:06:25,644
OUGHT TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO 

3652
02:06:25,644 --> 02:06:26,045
DO. 

3653
02:06:26,045 --> 02:06:30,349
I'VE TOLD THAT TO MY SENIOR 

3654
02:06:30,349 --> 02:06:30,916
COLLEAGUES, JUNIOR FOLKS. 

3655
02:06:30,916 --> 02:06:33,852
WE NEED EVERYONE TO ACHIEVE 

3656
02:06:33,852 --> 02:06:34,553
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MISSION. 

3657
02:06:34,553 --> 02:06:36,288
I HOPE EVERYONE IS ON THAT 

3658
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:36,555
MISSION. 

3659
02:06:36,555 --> 02:06:38,390
IF YOU'RE NOT, YOU SHOULD TAKE 

3660
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:40,826
THIS TIME TO GO DO SOMETHING 

3661
02:06:40,826 --> 02:06:41,226
MORE PRODUCTIVE. 

3662
02:06:41,226 --> 02:06:43,862
>> GOT TO BE ON THE TEAM. 

3663
02:06:43,862 --> 02:06:45,431
SO KEN, AS WE KNOW, ATTORNEY 

3664
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:46,231
GENERAL JEFF SESSION'S FATE HAS 

3665
02:06:46,231 --> 02:06:48,767
BEEN HANGING IN THE BALANCE FOR 

3666
02:06:48,767 --> 02:06:49,968
QUITE SOME TIME NOW. 

3667
02:06:49,968 --> 02:06:52,104
WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE HIM? 

3668
02:06:52,104 --> 02:06:53,005
WOULD THIS MAKE IT HARDER, OR 

3669
02:06:53,005 --> 02:06:55,507
EASIER FOR THE PRESIDENT TO GET 

3670
02:06:55,507 --> 02:06:57,076
RID OF HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL? 

3671
02:06:57,076 --> 02:06:58,343
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS INDICATED 

3672
02:06:58,343 --> 02:07:00,112
PREVIOUSLY THAT HE WOULDN'T 

3673
02:07:00,112 --> 02:07:01,914
MAKE ANY DECISION ON JEFF 

3674
02:07:01,914 --> 02:07:03,615
SESSIONS' FATE UNTIL AFTER THE 

3675
02:07:03,615 --> 02:07:04,048
MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 

3676
02:07:04,048 --> 02:07:05,283
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, THIS IS 

3677
02:07:05,283 --> 02:07:08,253
NOT HAPPENING IN A VACUUM. 

3678
02:07:08,253 --> 02:07:09,121
JEFF SESSIONS STILL REMAINS 

3679
02:07:09,121 --> 02:07:11,957
VERY WELL REGARDED IN THE 

3680
02:07:11,957 --> 02:07:12,190
SENATE. 

3681
02:07:12,190 --> 02:07:13,993
HE'S A FORMER ALABAMA SENATOR, 

3682
02:07:13,993 --> 02:07:15,894
AND RIGHT NOW, THE WHITE HOUSE 

3683
02:07:15,894 --> 02:07:17,396
NEEDS VOTES FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

3684
02:07:17,396 --> 02:07:20,399
TO GET HIM ACROSS THE FINISH 

3685
02:07:20,399 --> 02:07:20,599
LNE. 

3686
02:07:20,599 --> 02:07:22,434
SO IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE 

3687
02:07:22,434 --> 02:07:23,936
PRESIDENT WOULD DO SOMETHING 

3688
02:07:23,936 --> 02:07:26,838
LIKE FIRE JEFF SESSIONS ON THE 

3689
02:07:26,838 --> 02:07:29,508
CUSP OF THIS VOTER FOR 

3690
02:07:29,508 --> 02:07:29,942
KAVANAUGH. 

3691
02:07:29,942 --> 02:07:31,510
BUT IF ROSENSTEIN LEAVES, YOU 

3692
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:34,413
HAVE TO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, 

3693
02:07:34,413 --> 02:07:36,081
IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, 

3694
02:07:36,081 --> 02:07:37,950
SESSIONS' TIME THERE AT THE 

3695
02:07:37,950 --> 02:07:39,985
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT COULD BE 

3696
02:07:39,985 --> 02:07:40,252
NUMBERED. 

3697
02:07:40,252 --> 02:07:42,453
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN 

3698
02:07:42,453 --> 02:07:45,557
MIND THAT THE REASON ROD 

3699
02:07:45,557 --> 02:07:46,725
ROSENSTEIN HAS BEEN OVERSEEING 

3700
02:07:46,725 --> 02:07:48,060
THIS INVESTIGATION IS BECAUSE 

3701
02:07:48,060 --> 02:07:50,929
JEFF SESSIONS WAS THE ONE WHO 

3702
02:07:50,929 --> 02:07:51,430
RECUSED HIMSELF. 

3703
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:53,032
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE 

3704
02:07:53,032 --> 02:07:56,402
PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO HARP ON 

3705
02:07:56,402 --> 02:07:57,336
TO THIS DAY. 

3706
02:07:57,336 --> 02:07:59,638
HE FELT THAT SESSIONS BETRAYED 

3707
02:07:59,638 --> 02:08:01,006
HIM BY MAKING THAT DECISION TO 

3708
02:08:01,006 --> 02:08:03,976
RECUSE HIMSELF, AND IN IS SO, 

3709
02:08:03,976 --> 02:08:06,679
IT'S HARD TO SEE SESSIONS EVER 

3710
02:08:06,679 --> 02:08:09,515
YOU KNOW, FINDING HIMSELF BACK 

3711
02:08:09,515 --> 02:08:10,649
IN THE PRESIDENT'S GOOD GRACES, 

3712
02:08:10,649 --> 02:08:13,085
BUT I DON'T EXPECT THAT IT 

3713
02:08:13,085 --> 02:08:14,285
WOULD HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY. 

3714
02:08:14,285 --> 02:08:18,457
I THINK THEY NEED THE VOTES IN 

3715
02:08:18,457 --> 02:08:19,925
THE SENATE, YOU KNOW, IT'S MUCH 

3716
02:08:19,925 --> 02:08:22,494
TOO IMPORTANT FOR THAT AS IT 

3717
02:08:22,494 --> 02:08:23,328
RELATES TO KAVANAUGH. 

3718
02:08:23,328 --> 02:08:24,563
>> TRENDING IN DANGEROUS WATERS 

3719
02:08:24,563 --> 02:08:24,896
HERE, THOUGH. 

3720
02:08:24,896 --> 02:08:27,833
I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS NEXT 

3721
02:08:27,833 --> 02:08:28,100
QUESTION. 

3722
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:29,101
WE KNOW THAT DEMOCRATIC 

3723
02:08:29,101 --> 02:08:30,435
LAWMAKERS FOR MONTHS HAVE BEEN 

3724
02:08:30,435 --> 02:08:32,437
CALLING TO TAKE ACTION FOR THE 

3725
02:08:32,437 --> 02:08:32,837
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 

3726
02:08:32,837 --> 02:08:35,240
HOW DOES ALL OF THIS AFFECT 

3727
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:35,640
WHAT THEY WANT? 

3728
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:37,576
>> THAT HAS BEEN IN THEIR 

3729
02:08:37,576 --> 02:08:38,777
INTEREST FOR THE PAST SEVERAL 

3730
02:08:38,777 --> 02:08:40,445
MONTHS, BUT HAS ALWAYS BEEN 

3731
02:08:40,445 --> 02:08:42,948
POINTED TO BY REPUBLICANS AS A 

3732
02:08:42,948 --> 02:08:43,448
COMPLETE HYPOTHETICAL. 

3733
02:08:43,448 --> 02:08:45,184
EVERY TIME YOU WOULD ASK 

3734
02:08:45,184 --> 02:08:46,652
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE 

3735
02:08:46,652 --> 02:08:48,387
NEED TO PROTECT THE SPECIAL 

3736
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:49,988
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION, YOU DID 

3737
02:08:49,988 --> 02:08:53,225
HAVE A FEW LAWMAKERS WHO WANTED 

3738
02:08:53,225 --> 02:08:58,697
TO PUT FORTH LEGISLATION, TOM 

3739
02:08:58,697 --> 02:08:59,965
TILLIS AND OTHERS AMONG THEM. 

3740
02:08:59,965 --> 02:09:01,133
BUT YOU WOULD HEAR THAT THE 

3741
02:09:01,133 --> 02:09:02,167
PRESIDENT ISN'T GOING TO DO 

3742
02:09:02,167 --> 02:09:02,434
THAT. 

3743
02:09:02,434 --> 02:09:04,636
THERE IS NO NEED TO PUT THIS IN 

3744
02:09:04,636 --> 02:09:05,370
LEGISLATIVE FORM, BECAUSE THEY 

3745
02:09:05,370 --> 02:09:07,306
DIDN'T EXPECT HE WOULD DO THAT. 

3746
02:09:07,306 --> 02:09:10,442
THE QUESTION I HAVE AS OF 

3747
02:09:10,442 --> 02:09:11,643
TODAY, EVEN THOUGH ROD 

3748
02:09:11,643 --> 02:09:13,045
ROSENSTEIN DOES REMAIN THE 

3749
02:09:13,045 --> 02:09:15,080
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED 

3750
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:16,315
STATES, DOES THIS PROMPT 

3751
02:09:16,315 --> 02:09:17,549
LAWMAKERS TO REVISIT THIS 

3752
02:09:17,549 --> 02:09:19,384
LEDGIZATION, AND SAY THIS IS NO 

3753
02:09:19,384 --> 02:09:20,118
LONGER QUITE A HYPOTHETICAL. 

3754
02:09:20,118 --> 02:09:21,954
WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A 

3755
02:09:21,954 --> 02:09:23,989
FIRE DRILL THIS WEEK, IF WE CAN 

3756
02:09:23,989 --> 02:09:24,389
CALL IT THAT. 

3757
02:09:24,389 --> 02:09:27,593
SO DO WE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING 

3758
02:09:27,593 --> 02:09:30,195
IN PLACE, TO PLACE SOME 

3759
02:09:30,195 --> 02:09:32,631
PARAMETERS AROUND THE MUELLER 

3760
02:09:32,631 --> 02:09:33,298
PROBE? 

3761
02:09:33,298 --> 02:09:33,665
