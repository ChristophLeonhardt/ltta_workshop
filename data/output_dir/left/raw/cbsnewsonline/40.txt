1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:05,871
AGREEMENT WE HAD BEFORE, NAFTA, 

2
00:00:05,871 --> 00:00:12,512
HOW THIS WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT 

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:12,812
AMERICANS?

4
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,147
>> THIS IS A BIG WIN FOR THE 

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,549
PRESIDENT, ONE OF HIS SIGNATURE 

6
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:17,450
CAMPAIGN PROMISES, EASILY ONE 

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,386
OF THE BIGGEST APPLAUSE LINES 

8
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:21,521
IS WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT NAFTA, 

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,324
AND THAT IT IS QUOTE, ONE OF 

10
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:29,529
THE WORST DEALS ARE MADE. 

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,530
THERE WILL BE TOUTING THIS IS 

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,498
GREAT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND 

13
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,033
CREATE SOLID MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS, 

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,634
BUT IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THIS WILL 

15
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,636
DIRECTLY IMPACT AMERICANS, MANY 

16
00:00:37,636 --> 00:00:38,705
PROVISIONS DON'T GO INTO EFFECT 

17
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,373
UNTIL 2020, LET'S TAKE A LOOK 

18
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,508
AT TWO ASPECTS, HOW IT DEALS 

19
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:44,911
WITH CARS AND DAILY PRODUCTS, 

20
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,346
WHEN IT COMES TO AUTOMOBILE 

21
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,047
MANUFACTURING, THE GOAL IS TO 

22
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:51,184
HAVE MORE TRUCK AND CAR PARTS 

23
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:57,523
MANUFACTURED IN NORTH AMERICA, 

24
00:00:57,523 --> 00:00:58,725
IN FACT THIS NEW DEAL SAYS THAT 

25
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,959
IN ORDER TO AVOID A TARIFF, THE 

26
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,127
CAR OR TRUCK MUST HAVE 75% OF 

27
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,495
THE COMPONENTS MANUFACTURED IN 

28
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,030
CANADA, MEXICO OR U.S., THAT IS 

29
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,135
OVER AND IT -- AN 10% INCREASE. 

30
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:09,869
AND THE SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE 

31
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,674
OF THE WORK MUST BE DONE WITH A 

32
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,509
MINIMUM WAGE OF $16 PER HOUR. 

33
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,145
SOME PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT 

34
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,446
WHILE THIS MAY HELP NORTH 

35
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:29,689
COMERICA -- NORTH AMERICA, FOR 

36
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,356
SMALLER AUTOMOBILES, THEY MAY 

37
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:31,224
BE HARDER TO MANUFACTURE THAN 

38
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,425
HERE, SOME OF THAT WORK COULD 

39
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,160
GO TO CHINA, OTHER PARTS ARE 

40
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,196
DAIRY PRODUCTS, THE PRESIDENT 

41
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:38,031
HAS TALKED ABOUT HOW HE 

42
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,600
BELIEVES THAT CANADA'S DAIRY 

43
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,968
MARKET IS UNFAIR TO U.S. DAIRY 

44
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,870
PRODUCERS, AND NOW THEY WILL 

45
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,672
HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO CANADA'S 

46
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,741
DAIRY MARKET.

47
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,509
>> WE KNOW THE US-MEXICO 

48
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,277
REACHED A DEAL WEEKS AGO, WHAT 

49
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,779
FINALLY MADE CANADA JUMP ON 

50
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:58,585
BOARD?

51
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,419
>> THERE WAS A SELF-IMPOSED 

52
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,453
DEADLINE, BUT I DON'T THINK IT 

53
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,921
IS A SELF-IMPOSED DEADLINE, AS 

54
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,189
I SAID, THIS WAS ONE OF THE 

55
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,223
PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN 

56
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:07,326
PROMISES, THE THREE COUNTRIES 

57
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:10,229
STARTED NEGOTIATING OVER YEAR 

58
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,931
AGO, BUT AND MADE IT SORT OF 

59
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,499
HIT A SNAG BETWEEN THE U.S. AND 

60
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:17,770
CANADA, CANADA KIND OF STEPPED 

61
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,805
TO THE SIDE, WHILE THE MEXICO 

62
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:24,144
AND U.S. CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE 

63
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,378
AND WERE ABLE TO COME TO A 

64
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:25,978
TENTATIVE DEAL, THE PRESIDENT 

65
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,413
MADE IT CLEAR, HE WAS WILLING 

66
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,448
TO MOVE FORWARD EVEN WITHOUT 

67
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,316
CANADA, THE REMAINING STICKING 

68
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,285
POINT WAS THE DAIRY TERMS, THE 

69
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,321
DAIRY MARKET, IN ORDER TO 

70
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,756
COMPETE WITH CANADA ON THAT 

71
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:37,689
ISSUE, SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT 

72
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:40,426
MENTIONS ALMOST EVERY WEEK. 

73
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,095
THEY WERE ABLE TO COME TO A 

74
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:47,133
TENTATIVE DEAL, BUT SOME MARKET 

75
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:47,901
ANALYSTS HAVE QUESTIONED IF IT 

76
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,002
IS ALL WORTH IT, CANADA IS ONE 

77
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,203
OF OUR CLOSEST ALLIES, AND THEY 

78
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,371
QUESTION WHETHER HIS HARDBALL 

79
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,438
TACTICS HAVE WORKED TO DELIVER 

80
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:56,109
ON A SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN PROMISE,

81
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,310
OR IF THIS HAS DAMAGED OUR 

82
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,077
RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OF OUR 

83
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:03,983
CLOSEST ALLIES, AS THIS MARKET 

84
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,018
ANALYST PUT IT, FOR A FEW 

85
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,418
GALLONS OF MILK. 

86
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,886
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK 

87
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:07,820
ABOUT WHETHER NAFTA COULD BE 

88
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,956
RIPPED UP OR IGNORED, THAT YOU 

89
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,458
COULDN'T JUST PRISON -- PRETEND 

90
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,728
IT DIDN'T EXIST, IT WAS A LEGAL 

91
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:19,666
DOCUMENT, WITH THIS NEW TRADE 

92
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,301
DEAL, WHAT SORT OF HURDLES WILL 

93
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,236
BE FACING? 

94
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,437
>> ALL THREE COUNTRIES HAVE TO 

95
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,840
RATIFY IT, AND SIGN IT, AND IN 

96
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,875
THE U.S., THAT'S NOT EVEN GOING 

97
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,511
TO HAPPEN UNTIL LATE NOVEMBER, 

98
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,478
AND THIS WILL GO TO CONGRESS, 

99
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,146
BUT IF THE DEMOCRATS TAKE BACK 

100
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:36,015
THE HOUSE, IT COULD BE 

101
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:36,683
DIFFICULT POTENTIALLY TO GET 

102
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,118
THIS VERSION RATIFIED, THE 

103
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,520
DEMOCRATS COULD RALLY AND 

104
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,488
DEMAND ADDITIONAL CHANGES, AND 

105
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,823
CANADA AND MEXICO COULD FACE 

106
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,158
CHALLENGES AS WELL. 

107
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:47,327
A LONG WAY FOR THIS TO BE 

108
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,997
FINALIZED, AND RATIFIED, BUT 

109
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:53,032
JUST IN TERMS OF GETTING ALL 

110
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,033
THREE COUNTRIES TO THE TABLE TO 

111
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:54,867
AGREE ON SOMETHING, I BELIEVE 

112
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,270
THAT IS A WIN FOR THE PRESIDENT,

113
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,304
GO TO THE RALLIES, THE 

114
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,105
SUPPORTERS, PEOPLE WHO VOTED 

115
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,773
FOR HIM, OF ALL THE ISSUES HE 

116
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:04,377
RAISES, NAFTA IS ONE OF THE ONES

117
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,545
THAT SEEMS TO BE MOST IMPORTANT 

118
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,980
FOR PEOPLE, AND ABOUT WHICH 

119
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,815
THEY ARE MOST PASSIONATE. 

120
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:11,484
>> INDEED,PAULA, THOSE 

121
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:15,688
RALLIES, EVEN TODAY, THE 

122
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:16,255
PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT HOW 

123
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:20,293
NAFTA WAS THE WORST DEAL THAT 

124
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,394
THE WAS EVER SIGNED, BUT THE 

125
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,060
CHALLENGES, THE DEMOCRATS TAKE 

126
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,462
CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, ALSO THIS 

127
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:24,297
IS BEING DONE AS MEXICO'S 

128
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:30,303
PRESIDENT IS LEAVING OFFICE, 

129
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,170
AND THE CANADIAN PARLIAMENT HAS 

130
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,305
TO RATIFY THIS, A LOT OF 

131
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,205
QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED, A BIG 

132
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:34,540
DAY FOR THE PRESIDENT. 

133
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,942
THANK YOU.>>> THE FBI IS NOW 

134
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,009
INVESTIGATING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 

135
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,479
CLAIMS AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH, 

136
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,980
WHICH HAS STALLED HIS 

137
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,882
NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT.

138
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,517
HOW ARE VOTERS DECIDED -- 

139
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:47,453
DIVIDED? 

140
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,022
35% OF PEOPLE SUPPORT HIS 

141
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:55,628
NOMINATION, WHILE 37% ONE 

142
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,462
SENATORS TO VOTE AGAINST THEM, 

143
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,264
28% BELIEVE IT IS TOO SOON TO

00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,233
SAY.>> RACHEL MITRA, -- RACHEL

CITY HE SAID AND SHE SAID IS 

148
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:12,812
DIFFICULT. 

149
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,047
WITH THIS CASE IS WEAKER THAN 

150
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:15,247
THAT.

151
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:18,851
>> Reporter: AMY KLOBUCHAR SAID

155

INVESTIGATION.

INVESTIGATE JULIE SWETT NICK, 

162
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:41,307
WHERE SHE CLAIMED THAT WOMEN 

163
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,107
WERE GIVEN ALCOHOL AND SEXUALLY 

164
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:43,543
ASSAULTED THE PARTIES.

HIS DRINKING HABITS IN COLLEGE. 

171
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,566
THE FBI MIGHT INVESTIGATE THAT.

172

>> I DID NOT DRINK BEER TO THE 

173
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,367
POINT OF BLACKING OUT.

SENATE BY DOWNPLAYING HIS 

177
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,076
DRINKING HABITS, ON MULTIPLE 

178
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,812
OCCASIONS HE SAW HIM STAGGERING 

179
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:20,479
FROM ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, WHEN 

180
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,983
BRETT GOT DRUNK HE WAS OFTEN 

181
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,886
AGGRESSIVE, AND HE ADDED THAT 

182
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:31,524
HE WOULD TAKE THE FBI -- THE 

183
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,091

WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU, RON, 

196
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,788
THE FBI IS IN THE MIDST OF THE 

197
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:02,688
INVESTIGATION INTO THE 

198
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:07,894

AGENCY, WILL THEY BE LOOKING 

202
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,000
FOR? 

203
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,701
>> FIRST, IT'S IMPORTANT TO 

204
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,103
KNOW THAT THIS IS NEITHER AN 

205
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,739
FBI LED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, 

206
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:24,276
THAT TAKES ITS NATURAL PATH, OR 

207
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:25,010
A NATIONAL SECURITY 

208
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,044
INVESTIGATION THAT WOULD DO THE 

209
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:28,548
SAME, THIS IS REALLY THE FBI 

210
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,418
WORKING IN A SUPPORT ROLE FOR 

211
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,419
THE WHITE HOUSE, ALMOST AS A 

212
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,023
CONTRACTOR FOR A CLIENT. 

213
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:37,990
THE CLIENT GETS TO DEFINE THE

OVERALL TERMS OF THE 

215
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,092
ENGAGEMENT, SO WE DON'T KNOW 

216
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,594
TODAY EXACTLY WHAT THE WHITE 

217
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:46,933
HOUSE TESTING LOOKS LIKE, HOW 

218
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,434
MUCH LATITUDE THEY HAVE TO 

219
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,002
PURSUE ADDITIONAL INTERVIEWS 

220
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:50,903
BASED ON THE LIST OF INTERVIEWS 

221
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,405
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN, BUT 

222
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,774
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS TRY 

223
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,810
TO ENGAGE IN KNOWN WITNESSES, 

224
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,381
AND POTENTIALLY WITNESSES THAT 

225
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,050
ARE UNKNOWN TO US, AND ASK 

226
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,119
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT 

227
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,387
RELATE TO HIS SUITABILITY FOR 

228
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:12,091
HIS -- THIS IMPORTANT POSITION, 

229
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,160
ALCOHOL ABUSE, WHETHER OTHER 

230
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,394
PEOPLE WERE WITNESSES TO A 

231
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:20,867
PARTICULAR ALLEGED ENCOUNTER, 

232
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,268
ALL OF THAT I THINK IS ON THE 

233
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,002
TABLE. 

234
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,238
IT IS CIRCUMSCRIBED BY WHAT THE 

235
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:27,272
WHITE HOUSE IS ASKING OF THE 

236
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:27,473
FBI. 

237
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,908
>> RON, AS YOU KNOW, THE WHITE 

238
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,175
HOUSE INSISTS IT IS NOT 

239
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:31,811
MICROMANAGING THE 

240
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,410
INVESTIGATION, SOME LAWMAKERS 

241
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,248
CLAIMS THAT THEY ARE KEEPING 

242
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,414
THEM FROM INTERVIEWING SOME 

243
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:41,986
WITNESSES, I WANT TO READ AN OP-

244
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:43,722
ED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES FROM 

245
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,958
JAMES COMEY, ALTHOUGH THE 

246
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:46,826
PROCESS IS DEEPLY FLAWED, AND 

247
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:47,593
DESIGNED TO THWART THE FACT 

248
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,162
GATHERING PROCESS, THE FBI IS 

249
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,864
UP FOR THIS, IT IS NOT AS HARD 

250
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,234
AS SOME SENATORS HOPE IT WILL 

251
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,535
BE, FBI AGENTS KNOW THAT TIME 

252
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,603
HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH MEMORY, 

253
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,872
EVERY MARRIED PERSON REMEMBERS 

254
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,907
THE WEATHER ON THEIR WEDDING 

255
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:04,577
DAY, NO MATTER HOW LONG AGO, 

256
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:09,015
AND LITTLE LIES POINT TO BIGGER 

257
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:09,815
LIES, OBVIOUS LIES ABOUT THE 

258
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,684
NOMINEE ABOUT THE MEANING OF 

259
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,885
WORDS IN A YEARBOOK OR A 

260
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,819
FLASHING SIGNAL TO DIG DEEPER. 

261
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,555
IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF 

262
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,790
HOW THIS WILL PLAY OUT OVER THE 

263
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,192
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS?>> THE 

264
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:23,629
INVESTIGATORS ARE ABLE TO TEST 

265
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,799
WITNESS COMMENTS, WITNESS 

266
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,232
STATEMENTS, WITNESS 

267
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:31,103
RECOLLECTIONS, IDEALLY WITH 

268
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:31,971
CONTRARY OR OTHER EVIDENCE THAT 

269
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,040
THEY MIGHT HAVE ACCESS TO. 

270
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,874
SO THEY'RE LOOKING TO PUT 

271
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,976
TOGETHER A COMPOSITE PICTURE TO 

272
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,679
SEE WHOSE INFORMATION ADDS TO 

273
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,681
SOMETHING OF AN ENCOUNTER, OR 

274
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:48,053
TAKES AWAY FROM IT, BUT AT THE 

275
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,755
END, THE FBI IS NOT HERE TO 

276
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,623
REACH CONCLUSIONS, THEY ARE 

277
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,157
HERE TO AS THOSE HARD QUESTIONS 

278
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:54,894
OF COOPERATIVE WITNESSES, THEY 

279
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:55,927
DON'T HAVE COMPULSORY PROCESS, 

280
00:09:55,927 --> 00:10:00,433
THE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ISSUING 

281
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:06,038
SUBPOENAS -- THEY ARE NOT GOING 

282
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:06,805
TO BE ISSUING SUBPOENAS, IF 

283
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:08,040
úTH 

284
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,342
WE WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU 

285
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,009
ABOUT THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS, 

286
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,377
IT'S EASY FOR A POTENTIAL 

287
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,411
WITNESS TO SAY I HAVE NOTHING 

288
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,613
TO SAY, I'VE SEEN HOW THIS IS 

289
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,714
PLAYING OUT ON TV, I DON'T WANT 

290
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:17,016
TO BE PART OF IT, AND THE FBI 

291
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,551
WILL WALK AWAY ABSENT SOME 

292
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,286
OTHER CALL BECAUSE PRESSURE WAS 

293
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,288
BROUGHT IN SOME OTHER WAY. 

294
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,858
THEY WILL APPEAR AS A FACTFINDER

295
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,026
TO PRESENT THAT BACK TO THE 

296
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,194
WHITE HOUSE, WHO WOULD 

297
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,428
PRESUMABLY PRESENTED TO THE 

298
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:33,933
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, AND 

299
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:34,800
LET THEM DETERMINE HOW DOES 

300
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,368
THIS MOVE THE NEEDLE IN ANY 

301
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:37,103
PARTICULAR WAY. 

302
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,771
THE FBI IS CERTAINLY UP TO THE 

303
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:38,971
TASK. 

304
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:43,509
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SPENT LITTLE 

305
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,344
TIME PUSHING BACK AGAINST THOSE 

306
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,546
CRITICIZING THE INVESTIGATION, 

307
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,915
JUST STARTING TO HEAR THE 

308
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,985
DEMOCRATS, ONLY THINKING 

309
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:54,920
OBSTRUCT AND DELAY, AND PUTTING 

310
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,055
OUT THE WORD THAT THE TIME AND 

311
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,122
SCOPE OF FBI LOOKING INTO JUDGE 

312
00:10:57,122 --> 00:10:58,457
KAVANAUGH AND WITNESSES IS NOT 

313
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:58,690
ENOUGH. 

314
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,625
HELLO, FOR THEM, IT WILL NEVER 

315
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,927
BE ENOUGH. 

316
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,498
AND VLADIMIR DUTHIERS POINTED 

317
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,432
OUT, JAMES COMEY SAID IN THE OP-

318
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,133
ED, BEFORE  HE TALKED ABOUT HOW 

319
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:10,569
SKILLED FBI AGENTS ARE, HE SAYS 

320
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,171
IF TRUTH WERE THE ONLY GOAL, 

321
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,406
THERE WOULD BE NO CLOCK, AND 

322
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:15,908
THE INVESTIGATION WOULD NOT 

323
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,744
HAVE BEEN SOUGHT AFTER THEY ARE 

324
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:22,448
INDOORS THE NOMINEE. 

325
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,415
THE QUESTION IS, WITH ONLY A 

326
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:24,583
WEEK TO CONDUCT THIS 

327
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,951
INVESTIGATION, CAN A THOROUGH 

328
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:26,952
INVESTIGATION ACTUALLY BE 

329
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:27,820
CONDUCTED?

330
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,957
>> IF YOU HAVE TOTALLY 

331
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:32,490
COOPERATIVE WITNESSES PRE-

332
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,726
IDENTIFIED, AND THE SCOPE IS 

333
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,161
WIDE ENOUGH, I THINK THE FBI IS 

334
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:37,396
CAPABLE OF ADDING SIGNIFICANT 

335
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,065
VALUE TO THE BACKGROUND 

336
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,333
INVESTIGATION THAT HAS ALREADY 

337
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,268
OCCURRED HERE. 

338
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,103
THIS IS UNMISTAKABLY A THREE-

339
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,840
DIMENSIONAL CHESS GAME, WHERE 

340
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,541
YOU HAVE ALL KINDS OF LAYERS OF 

341
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,876
POLITICS, WHETHER IT IS TO 

342
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,978
LAYCOCK -- 

343
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:01,187
>> WHETHER IT IS DELAY, STALL, 

344
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,488
GO AND BE AN INDEPENDENT 

345
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,690
FACTFINDER, IF PEOPLE CAN BE 

346
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,824
CONVINCED BY ADDITIONAL 

347
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:06,792
EVIDENCE, EITHER THAT THE 

348
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,695
PROCESS HAS NOW BEEN MADE RIGHT,

349
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,330
OR THAT THE PROCESS WAS NEVER 

350
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,698
RIGHT, AND THE POLITICS ARE 

351
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,467
WRONG, I SUSPECT AS MAJOR 

352
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:23,409
GARRETT REFLECTED, YOU PROBABLY 

353
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,376
HAVE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE 

354
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,911
UP THEIR MINDS ONE WAY OR THE 

355
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,546
OTHER, AND THE FBI'S JOB IS TO 

356
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,949
ADD CLARITY FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT 

357
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,016
HAVE AN OPEN MIND ON THIS. 

358
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,585
>> COULD THE CLARITY BE AS 

359
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,722
SIMPLE AS -- SO THE NOMINEE WAS 

360
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,823
ASKED SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT 

361
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,892
REFERENCES IN HIS YEARBOOK, 

362
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:40,993
SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS 

363
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,428
DRINKING HABITS, THERE ARE 

364
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,562
SOME, WITHOUT EVIDENCE, WHO 

365
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:50,769
FEEL THAT HE PERHAPS MISLED THE 

366
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,436
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, AND 

367
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,104
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS 

368
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:52,971
INITIALLY CAME UP BECAUSE OF 

369
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,139
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL 

370
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:55,741
MISCONDUCT, BUT EVEN IF THE FBI 

371
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,276
IS ABLE TO SAY WILL LOOK, HE 

372
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,212
DID DRINK A LOT IN HIGH SCHOOL, 

373
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:04,016
HE DID DRINK A LOT IN COLLEGE, 

374
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,417
HE EVADED THOSE QUESTIONS OR 

375
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:09,455
MISCHARACTERIZED THEM, WHETHER 

376
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,056
IT IS LIMITED OR NOT, THE 

377
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,826
INVESTIGATION, JUST ANSWERING 

378
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,426
THOSE SIMPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT 

379
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,594
WHAT THE NOMINEE SAID WHEN HE 

380
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,328
WAS BEING INTERROGATED BY THE 

381
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,632
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, 

382
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,599
WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH TO SAY 

383
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,234
THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS FLAWS IN 

384
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:25,771
THIS CANDIDATE?

385
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,406
>> THAT CONCLUSION IS UP TO 

386
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,176
EACH INDIVIDUAL SENATOR, MY 

387
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,845
UNBELIEF AND EXPERIENCES, 

388
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,378
DIFFERENT PEOPLE PROCESS 

389
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:35,447
ALCOHOL IN DIFFERENT WAYS, 2 

390
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:40,552
DRINKS TO ONE PERSON MAY BE 

391
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:41,587
WHAT LOOKS LIKE A DOZEN DRINKS 

392
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,088
TO SOMEONE ELSE, OR COUPLE OF 

393
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,323
CASES, SO I DON'T SEE THE 

394
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:48,427
CANDIDATE CHANGING HIS VERSION 

395
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:54,733
OF EVENTS HERE, BUT I DO THINK 

396
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,367
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY, THE 

397
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,201
WINDOW IS OPEN, FOR ADDITIONAL 

398
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:57,036
WITNESSES TO SELF IDENTIFY, TO 

399
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:01,206
CONTACT THOSE FBI FIELD 

400
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:01,974
OFFICERS, OR THE MAIN FBI 

401
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,208
NUMBER, AND SAY I HAVE VALUABLE 

402
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,843
INFORMATION, I WANT TO WEIGH IN 

403
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,146
ON THIS, AND IF THOSE LEADS ARE 

404
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,613
PURSUED, THAT MAY SHED 

405
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:11,617
ADDITIONAL LIGHT, OR WE MAY -- 

406
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:16,622
END UP AT THE END OF THE WEEK 

407
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,423
NOT MOVING THE BALL AND INCH. 

408
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,424
>> BEFORE I GO, SOMETHING I 

409
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,794
DIDN'T THINK OF, YOU JUST SAID, 

410
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:22,528
CAN SOMEONEWHO HAS CREDIBLE 

411
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,163
EVIDENCE, THE FBI AND SAY I 

412
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:29,368
WANT TO ADD TO THE 

413
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,235
INVESTIGATION, DOES THE FBI SAY 

414
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:31,437
WE ARE NOT TALKING TO YOU, WE 

415
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,304
ARE ONLY TALKING TO THE 

416
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:32,938
SPECIFIC PEOPLE, BECAUSE 

417
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:33,672
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE SAID HE 

418
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,441
WANTED IT TO BE LIMITED IN TIME 

419
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:41,246
AND SCOPE, OR DOES THE FBI HAVE 

420
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:42,147
AN OBLIGATION TO LISTEN TO 

421
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,115
PEOPLE, IT CAN'T JUST OPEN THE 

422
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:43,849
FLOODGATES TO EVERYONE WHO 

423
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,517
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, 

424
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,785
BUT IF THEY FIND IT TO BE 

425
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:47,586
CREDIBLE, CAN THEY INVESTIGATED 

426
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,688
OR CAN THEY SAY NO? 

427
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,090
>> I THINK FIRST, THE PUBLIC 

428
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:57,029
CAN CERTAINLY CALL THE FBI, IF 

429
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,230
YOU CALL YOUR LOCAL FBI OFFICE 

430
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,331
NOW, THEY ARE ALL ROUTED TO A 

431
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,199
CALL CENTER IN WEST VIRGINIA, 

432
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,233
I'M SURE THOSE FOLKS AT THE 

433
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,469
CALL CENTER ARE ON ALERT TO 

434
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,403
INFORMATION COMING ABOUT THIS 

435
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,905
VERY IMPORTANT EVENT, THIS 

436
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:09,541
CONFIRMATION PROCESS, AND THE 

437
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,411
FBI'S ROLE IN IT, HOPEFULLY IT 

438
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,714
IS PRETTY SMOOTH, FROM A 

439
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,448
COMPLAINT, OR INFORMATION TO 

440
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,385
THE SECURITY DIVISION THAT 

441
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,085
OVERSEES THESE, GETTING THE 

442
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,021
INFORMATION THEY ARE, PEOPLE 

443
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,155
MAKING AN ASSESSMENT AS TO 

444
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:28,560
WHETHER WE ARE UNDER THE WHITE 

445
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,230
HOUSE RULES, CAN WE PURSUE 

446
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,934
THIS, ON HER OWN, AND THEY WILL 

447
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,767
RELAY SOME OF THE INFORMATION 

448
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,069
BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAY 

449
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:37,903
LOOK, THIS IS THE VOLUME OF 

450
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,672
WHAT IS COMING IN, AND THE FEEL 

451
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,407
OF WHAT IS COMING IN, WHERE YOU 

452
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,908
WANT TO GO WITH THIS, BECAUSE 

453
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:45,644
WE CAN EXPECT THAT IF THEY 

454
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,746
DON'T PURSUE IT FULLY, THE 

455
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:51,583
DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THIS GROUP 

456
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,385
IS GOING TO BE RAISING A RUCKUS 

457
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:57,055
ABOUT THE FBI BEING UNDULY 

458
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:57,389
CONSTRAINED. 

459
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,824
>> IT GOES BACK TO THE QUESTION 

460
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,792
ALL ALONG, IS THAT NORMAL FOR 

461
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:04,263
THE FBI TO SAY, HEY WHITE 

462
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,030
HOUSE, HERE'S AN ALLEGATION 

463
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,532
THAT'S COME IN, WHAT SHOULD WE 

464
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,900
DO ABOUT IT, OR DO THEY JUST GO 

465
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,968
TO THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND SAY 

466
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,204
WE HAVE THESE ALLEGATIONS, 

467
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,205
UNDER THE AUTHORITY WE HAVE, WE 

468
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,273
ARE BOUND TO PURSUE THEM, IT 

469
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:16,442
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE WHITE 

470
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:20,012
HOUSE SAYS CLICK 

471
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,680
>> THIS PROCESS IS VERY 

472
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,514
UNUSUAL, I SUSPECT THAT THE 

473
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,216
WHITE HOUSE IN CONCERT WITH THE 

474
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,416
REPUBLICANS ON THE JUDICIARY 

475
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:29,221
COMMITTEE, HAVE LAID OUT THE 

476
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,089
TERMS OF WHAT ADDITIONAL WORK 

477
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,957
THEY WANT THE FBI TO DO, AND IF 

478
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,892
SOMETHING IS WITHIN THAT LANE, 

479
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:38,597
GO AHEAD AND PURSUE IT, BUT IF 

480
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,698
IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS MATERIALLY 

481
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,134
OUTSIDE THE LANE, LET US KNOW 

482
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:42,734
BEFORE YOU PURSUE IT. 

483
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:43,936
I THINK THE FBI IS CONSTRAINED 

484
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,771
HERE, CLEARLY WITHIN TIME 

485
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,707
CONSTRAINTS, AND VERY LIKELY 

486
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:52,878
VERY CLOSELY WATCHED SUBSET OF 

487
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,513
CONSTRAINTS AS WELL.

488
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,416
>> RON, ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE 

489
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:04,623
YOUR ANALYSIS.>> MY PLEASURE. 

490
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:15,067
>>> WE ARE BREAKING IN TO SHOW 

491
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,001
YOU THE ROSE GARDEN, JUST 

492
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:16,969
MOMENTS FROM NOW WE ARE HOPING 

493
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,002
TO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT, 

494
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:18,871
TALKING ABOUT THIS NEW DEAL 

495
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,737
THAT HE HAMMERED OUT BETWEEN 

496
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:21,339
MEICO, THE U.S. AND CANADA TO 

497
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,911
REPLACE NAFTA, HE CALLED NAFTA 

498
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,947
ULCERS OF THINGS, INCLUDING ONE 

499
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,315
OF THE WORST DEALS EVER 

500
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,349
HAMMERED OUT, AND REPEATEDLY 

501
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:34,352
SAID THERE WAS AN IMBALANCE IN 

502
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:38,624
TRADE, AND SO THIS IS A KEY 

503
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,425
CAMPAIGN PROMISE, THAT REALLY, 

504
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:42,094
IT ALMOST LOOKED LIKE IT WASN'T 

505
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,096
GOING TO HAPPEN, THERE WAS A 

506
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,298
MIDNIGHT DEADLINE, CANADA HAD 

507
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,734
NOT COME TO AN AGREEMENT, AND 

508
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:53,872
AT THE 11th HOUR CAME INTO THE 

509
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:54,139
AGREEMENT.

510
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:57,810
>> AND HERE IS THE PRESIDENT.

511
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:11,323
>> [ APPLAUSE ] [ APPLAUSE ]

512
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,959
>> THANK YOU. 

513
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,995
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PLEASE SIT 

514
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:22,901
DOWN. 

515
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:23,902
IT IS REALLY GREAT TO SEE 

516
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:24,603
EVERYBODY ON THIS BEAUTIFUL, 

517
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,804
BEAUTIFUL DAY IN WASHINGTON, 

518
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,872
WASHINGTON DC. 

519
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:30,042
SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS ONE, BUT I 

520
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,178
WILL NOT SAY THAT TODAY, I 

521
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,079
REFUSE, THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT, 

522
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,350
WHAT WE ARE DOING, ONE OF THE 

523
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,184
MOST IMPORTANT DEALS, AND THE 

524
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,219
MOST IMPORTANT TRADE DEAL WE'VE 

525
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,853
EVER MADE BY FAR, I WANT TO 

526
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:48,360
THINK SENATOR JONI ERNST FROM 

527
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,127
IOWA, WE WILL BE DOING 

528
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:49,928
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT IN 

529
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,563
IOWA, BUT THIS IS MAYBE MORE 

530
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,730
IMPORTANT THAN EVERYTHING PUT 

531
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,100
TOGETHER, I WOULD THINK YOU FOR 

532
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,400
BEING HERE. 

533
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:04,509

I AM THRILLED TO SPEAK TO THE

AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SHARE TRULY 

539
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:19,458
HISTORIC NEWS FOR OUR NATION. 

540
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,127
AND INDEED, FOR THE WORLD, I 

541
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,962
WANT TO THINK VICE PRESIDENT

COMPLETED NEGOTIATIONS ON A 

545
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,075
BRAND-NEW DEAL TO TERMINATE AND 

546
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:41,013
REPLACE NAFTA, AND THE NAFTA 

547
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,180

HEARING, USMCA,  A GOOD RING TO 

554
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:10,942
IT, I HAVE SAID THAT NAFTA WAS 

555
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:11,810
PERHAPS THE WORST TRADE DEAL 

556
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,511
EVER MADE, SINCE NAFTA'S 

557
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,012

ERDOGAN TRADE DEFICITS TOTALING 

559

$2 TRILLION, AND IT IS MUCH 

560
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:25,157
HIGHER, WITH CANADA AND MEXICO, 

561
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,090
IT LOST VAST AMOUNTS OF MONEY, 

562
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,459
AND FOUR-POINT 1 MILLION 

563
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:32,030
MANUFACTURING JOBS, AND 1 IN 4 

564
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,034
OTHER JOBS, EVEN MORE THAN 

565
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:36,234
THAT. 

566
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,169
THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN, I 

567
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,405
PROMISED TO RENEGOTIATE NAFTA, 

568
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,906
AND WE HAVE KEPT THAT PROMISE 

569
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:44,409
TODAY, BUT FOR 25 YEARS AS A 

570
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,112
CIVILIAN, A BUSINESSMAN, I USED 

571
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,146
TO SAY HOW COULD ANYONE HAVE 

572
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,781
SIGNED A DEAL LIKE NAFTA, AND I 

573
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,217
WATCHED NEW ENGLAND, SO ME 

574
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,653
PLACES WHERE I WAS, THE 

575
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,320
FACTORIES WERE LEAVING, THE 

576
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,122
JOBS WERE LEAVING, PEOPLE WERE 

577
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,425
BEING FIRED, AND WE CAN'T HAVE 

578
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,059
THAT. 

579
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:04,062
SO WE HAVE NEGOTIATED THIS NEW 

580
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,030
AGREEMENT BASED ON THE 

581
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,866
PRINCIPLE OF FAIRNESS AND 

582
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:08,266
RECIPROCITY. 

583
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,068
TO ME, IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 

584
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,704
WORD IN TRADE, BECAUSE WE HAVE 

585
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:13,738
BEEN TREATED SO UNFAIRLY BY SO 

586
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:14,606
MANY NATIONS ALL OVER THE 

587
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,675
WORLD, AND WE ARE CHANGING THAT.

588
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:17,876
WE JUST SIGNED A MUCH BETTER 

589
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:22,381
DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA, WE HAD A 

590
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,515
HORRIBLE DEAL, AND WE SIGNED IT 

591
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:27,452
AT THE UNITED NATIONS, AND THAT 

592
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,487

00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,723
JOBS, GOOD FOR A LOT OF THINGS, 

595
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:35,894
THEY SAID THAT 250,000 JOBS 

596
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,164
WILL BE GIVEN BY SIGNING THE 

597
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,966

598
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,702
250,000 JOBS TO SOUTH KOREA, 

599
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,738
NOT TO THE UNITED STATES, THAT 

600
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:47,872
HS CHANGED, FOR THE BETTER, 

601
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:50,708
THIS IS A BRAND-NEW DEAL. 

602
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,811

LOOK AT THE REVIEWS, PEOPLE 

670
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,169

671
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,136
ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OR SAY GOOD 

672
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:05,737

673
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:06,605
THEY HAVE TO SAY BAD, SOME 

674

SAYING THIS WAS REALLY AMAZING 

679
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:16,381
IF YOU REALLY GOT ALL OF THAT. 

680

00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,316
>> I WANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC, 

729
00:26:59,316 --> 00:27:01,219
RIGHT? 

730
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,020
AND MANY OTHER PRODUCTS, BUT 

731
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,991
THOSE PRODUCTS WERE NOT REALLY 

732
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:08,326
BEING TREATED FAIRLY AS FAR AS 

733
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,828
THOSE WHO WORK SO HARD TO 

734
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,696
PRODUCE THEM, AND NOW THEY ARE 

735
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,966
GOING TO BE TREATED FAIRLY. 

736
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:15,600
THESE MEASURES WILL SUPPORT 

737
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,202
MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 

738
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,804
AMERICAN JOBS, THIS IS ALSO A 

739
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,972
HISTORIC WIN FOR AMERICAN 

740
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:27,077
MANUFACTURERS, AND AMERICAN 

741
00:27:27,077 --> 00:27:27,845
AUTOWORKERS, TREATED SO BADLY, 

742
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:29,381
WE'VE LOST 70 JOBS OVER THE 

743
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,849
YEARS UNDER NAFTA, UNDER THE 

744
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,485
CURRENT NEW DEAL, AND IF YOU 

745
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,019
LOOK AT THE CURRENT NAFTA DEAL, 

746
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:38,523
THE NEW DEAL IS TAKING CARE OF 

747
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,024
ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS, BECAUSE 

748
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:44,662
NAFTA, FOREIGN COMPANIES HAVE 

749
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,497
BEEN ALLOWED TO MANUFACTURE 

750
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,232
MANY OF THEIR PARTS OVERSEAS, 

751
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,767
SHIP THEM TO MEXICO AND CANADA 

752
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,268
FOR ASSEMBLY, AND SEND THEIR 

753
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,237
FOREIGN-MADE CARS INTO THE 

754
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,273
UNITED STATES WITH NO TAX. 

755
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,875
SO WE LET ALL OF OUR PEOPLE GO, 

756
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,176
WE FIRE EVERYBODY, THEY MAKE 

757
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,779
CARS, THEY MAKE PRODUCTS, THEY 

758
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:04,449
MAKE EVERYTHING, IN ANOTHER 

759
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,984
COUNTRY, THEY SEND THEM TO THE 

760
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,920
UNITED STATES, NO TAX. 

761
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,954
AND THE COST IS VERY LITTLE 

762
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:10,689
DIFFERENCE, SOMETIMES IT'S MORE 

763
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,856
FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT LIKE TO 

764
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,092
TALK ABOUT COST, WITH THIS 

765
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,860
AGREEMENT, WE ARE CLOSING ALL 

766
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,764
OF THESE TERRIBLE LOOPHOLES, 

767
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,901
THEIR CLOSE, GONE, A DISASTER, 

768
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:23,868
WE ARE REQUIRING A LARGE 

769
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,969
PORTION OF EVERY CAR TO BE MADE 

770
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:29,274
BY HIGH WAGE WORKERS, WHICH 

771
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,241
WILL REDUCE OUTSOURCING, A 

772
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,878
TREMENDOUS PROBLEM, AND IT 

773
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,512
MEANS MORE AUTO-PARTS AND 

774
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:35,012
AUTOMOBILES WILL BE 

775
00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:36,280
MANUFACTURED INSIDE THE UNITED 

776
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,015
DATES, WE WILL BE MANUFACTURING 

777
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:39,584
MANY MORE CARS, AND OUR 

778
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,553
COMPANIES WILL NOT BE LEAVING 

779
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,490
THE UNITED STATES -- INSIDE THE 

780
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:52,730
UNITED STATES. THEY WILL NOT BE 

781
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,430
BUILDING CARS ELSEWHERE, THERE 

782
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,365
IS NO LONGER THAT INCENTIVE, 

783
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,400
UNDER THE NAFTA DEAL, THEY HAD 

784
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,534
THAT INCENTIVE, THEY HAVE THE 

785
00:28:56,534 --> 00:29:00,872
OPPOSITE ONE NOW, THEY WILL BE 

786
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:01,372
LEAVING OUR COUNTRY. 

787
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,375
I DO NOT WANT TO SEE OUR 

788
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,143
COMPANIES LEAVE AND FIRE OUR 

789
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,778
WORKERS, AND OUR WORKERS NEVER 

790
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,112
GET JOBS TO REPLACE THOSE JOBS, 

791
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:12,383
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. 

792
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,351
THIS DEAL WILL ALSO IMPOSE NEW 

793
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,152
STANDARDS REQUIRING AT LEAST 

794
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,354
75% OF EVERY AUTOMOBILE TO BE 

795
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:19,624
MADE IN NORTH AMERICA, IN ORDER 

796
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,159
TO QUALIFY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF 

797
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,394
FREE AXIS TO OUR MARKETS, AND 

798
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,429
THAT'S WHAT IT IS, IT'S A 

799
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,030
PRIVILEGE, WE DON'T TAKE IT AS 

800
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,400
A PRIVILEGE, IT IS A PRIVILEGE 

801
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,505
FOR THEM TO DO BUSINESS WITH US.

802
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,472
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT 

803
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,339
MEXICO OR CANADA, I'M TALKING 

804
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:35,907
ABOUT EVERYBODY. 

805
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:36,207
EVERYBODY. 

806
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,878
IT IS A PRIVILEGE FOR CHINA TO 

807
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,113
DO BUSINESS WITH US, IT IS A 

808
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,347
PRIVILEGE FOR THE EUROPEAN 

809
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:45,149
UNION, WHO HAS TREATED US VERY 

810
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:48,319
BADLY, BUT THAT'S COMING ALONG, 

811
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,089
TO DO BUSINESS WITH US, JAPAN, 

812
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,456
EVERY COUNTRY, A PRIVILEGE FOR 

813
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:55,727
THEM TO COME IN AND ATTACK THE 

814
00:29:55,727 --> 00:30:00,165
PIGGY BANK. 

815
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,366
IN THIS, WE WILL HAVE A RESULT 

816
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,934
OF MUCH MORE HAPPENING IN THE 

817
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,904
UNITED STATES, IT MEANS MORE 

818
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,207
THAN ANYTHING ELSE, FAR MORE 

819
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,575
AMERICAN JOBS, THESE ARE HIGH-

820
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,510
QUALITY JOBS, STRONG PROVISIONS 

821
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,613

822
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,016
RULES OF ORIGIN REQUIREMENTS, 

823
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,617
THIS WILL INCENTIVIZE BILLIONS 

824
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,753
OF DOLLARS IN NEW PURCHASES OF 

825
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:25,289
U.S. MADE AUTOMOBILES. 

826
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:26,324
ONCE APPROVED, THIS WILL BE A 

827
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,526
NEW DAWN FOR THE AMERICAN AUTO 

828
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,561
INDUSTRY, AND FOR THE AMERICAN 

829
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:33,364
AUTO WORKER, THEY WILL SEE, 

830
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,265
THEY UNDERSTAND, THEY VOTED FOR 

831
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,867
US IN LARGE NUMBERS, EVEN 

832
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,468
THOUGH THEIR LEADERSHIP ALWAYS 

833
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,371
GOES DEMOCRAT. 

834
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,673
A COUPLE OF THEM SAID TO ME, I 

835
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,241
DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN DO IT 

836
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,509
AGAIN, MANY OF THEM, THE 

837
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,845
LEADERS WOULD BACK DEMOCRATS 

838
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:48,813
AND TELL ME, YOU ARE GOING TO 

839
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:49,881
GET MOST OF THE VOTES FROM 

840
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,450
UNION WORKERS, AND WE GOT MOST 

841
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,954
OF THE VOTES FROM WORKERS,.. 

842
00:30:55,954 --> 00:31:02,961
-- FROM WORKERS, PERIOD. THEY 

843
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:03,995
WERE VERY MUCH BEHIND WHAT WE 

844
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,363
WERE DOING IS ONE PRIMARY 

845
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,197
ASPECT, IT WILL TRANSFORM NORTH

MANUFACTURING JOBS ESSENTIALLY, 

852
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,009
WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE THINGS 

853
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:18,276
ANYMORE? 

854
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,744

BEEN OFF SHORED TO THE WORLD 

859
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:35,793
BECAUSE OF UNFAIR TRADE ISSUES.

00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:36,461
WE ALSO PROVIDE BRAND-NEW

PROTECTIONS FOR BIOLOGIC DRUGS,

00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,163
WHICH WILL MAKE NORTH AMERICA A 

864
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,699

INSTEAD OF JOBS LEAVING FOR

IN THEORY THERE SHOULD BE NO 

917
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,914
TROUBLE, BUT ANYTHING YOU 

918
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:37,581

919
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:43,087

TRUMP LIKES IT, THEREFORE WE 

923

ARE NOT GOING TO PROVE IT, THAT 

924
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,329
WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE 

925
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,196
REPUBLICANS, SO WE CAN'T 

926
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,165
APPROVE IT, IT WILL BE SENT TO 

927
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,967

AND BALANCED TRADE DEAL WITH 

932
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:06,811
SOUTH KOREA, A TREMENDOUS 

933
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:07,812
DIFFERENCE IN THE DEAL FROM 

934
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,547
WHAT IT WAS, IT WAS A DISASTER, 

935
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,148
AS I SAID. 

936
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:14,217
TO APPROVE THE OLD DEAL THAT 

937
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:15,217
KILLED SO MANY JOBS, IT FOLLOWS 

938
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:16,353

JAPAN WOULD NEVER NEGOTIATE 

941
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:22,793
WITH THE U.S., THEY SAID WE ARE 

942
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:24,762
NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE, THEY 

943
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:25,263
TOLD THE PREVIOUS

DON'T HAVE TO NEGOTIATE, BUT WE 

947
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,101

948
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:32,469
SUBSTANTIAL TAX UNDER CAR IF

00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,007
AND WITHOUT TARIFFS, WE 

951
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,341
WOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT A 

952
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,677

STANDING HERE, BOB AND ALL OF 

958
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,088
THESE FOLKS, WE WOULD NOT BE 

959
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:52,556
STANDING HERE, WE ARE TOTALLY 

960
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,192
PREPARED TO DO THAT IF THEY 

961
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:57,595
DON'T NEGOTIATE, BUT JAPAN IS 

962
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,463
WANTING TO NEGOTIATE, THE CALL 

963
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:02,400
ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO, AND HE 

964
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,670
IS A TERRIFIC MAN, JUST HAD A 

965
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,573
TREMENDOUS VICTORY, AND THEY 

966
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,141
SAID WE WOULD LIKE TO START 

967
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,343
NEGOTIATIONS IMMEDIATELY.>>> 

968
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,777
INDIA, WHICH IS THE TERROR OF 

969
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:16,346
KING, THEY CALLED US AND SAID 

970
00:35:16,346 --> 00:35:17,781
WE WANT TO START NEGOTIATIONS 

971
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:20,985
IMMEDIATELY, WHEN BOB LIKE 

972
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,554
KAISER -- 

973
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:31,929
>> WHEN BOB LIGHTHEISER TALK TO 

974
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,998
THEM, THEY SAID THEY WANTED TO 

975
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,399
KEEP US HAPPY, THEY ARE WISE TO 

976
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:39,537
WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING, INDIA 

977
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:43,240
CHARGES 100% TARIFFS, THAT IS 

978
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,711
NOT FREE TRADE, AND I WOULD SAY 

979
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,412
WHERE DO THESE PEOPLE COME 

980
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:52,550
FROM, SO BECAUSE OF THE POWER 

981
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,385
OF TARIFFS, AND THE POWER WE 

982
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,554
HAVE WITH TARIFFS, IN MANY 

983
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,588
CASES WE WON'T EVEN HAVE TO USE 

984
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:57,788
THEM. 

985
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:02,793
THAT IS HOW POWERFUL THEY ARE 

986
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:03,995
AND HOW GOOD THEY ARE, BUT IN 

987
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,129
MANY CASES, WE ARE NOT GOING TO 

988
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:05,863
HAVE TO USE THEM. 

989
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,164
IN MANY CASES, COUNTRIES THAT 

990
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:08,833
ARE CHARGING MASSIVE TARIFFS 

991
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,269
ARE ELIMINATING THOSE TARIFFS. 

992
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,037
AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE $250 

993
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:17,775
BILLION AT 25% INTEREST, WITH 

994
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:21,145
CHINA RIGHT NOW, AND WE COULD GO

995
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:27,318
$267 BILLION MORE, AND CHINA 

996
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,486
WANTS TO TALK VERY BADLY, AND I 

997
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,687
SAID FRANKLY, IT'S TOO EARLY TO 

998
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,621
TALK, WE CAN'T TALK NOW, THEY 

999
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:31,989
ARE NOT READY, THEY'VE BEEN 

1000
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,224
RIPPING US FOR SO MANY YEARS, 

1001
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:35,526
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN QUICKLY, AND 

1002
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,928
IF POLITICALLY, PEOPLE FORCE IT 

1003
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:39,930
TO QUICKLY, YOU ARE NOT GOING 

1004
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,799
TO MAKE THE RIGHT DEAL FOR 

1005
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:42,933
WORKERS IN OUR COUNTRY, CHINA 

1006
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:46,237
WANTS TO TALK, WE WANT TO TALK 

1007
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,605
TO THEM, WE WANT THEM TO HELP 

1008
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,340
US WITH NORTH KOREA, TO 

1009
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,108
CONTINUE TO DO THAT, VERY 

1010
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:51,842
IMPORTANT.

1011
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,745
>>> THE EUROPEAN UNION, VERY 

1012
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,914
TOUGH ON THE UNITED STATES, 

1013
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:03,454
LAST YEAR AND FOR MANY YEARS, 

1014
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,455
THEY LOST IN THE VICINITY OF 

1015
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,289
$150 BILLION A YEAR, MASSIVE 

1016
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,057
TRADE BARRIERS, AND THEY DID 

1017
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:08,359
NOT WANT TO COME. 

1018
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,195
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TALK. 

1019
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,965
JEAN-CLAUDE, A GREAT 

1020
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:17,101
BUSINESSPERSON, HEAD OF THE 

1021
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,236
EUROPEAN UNION, MY FRIEND, I 

1022
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,204
SAY JOHN CLAUDE, WE WANT TO 

1023
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,305
MAKE A DEAL. 

1024
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,408
HE SAYS NO, WE ARE VERY HAPPY, 

1025
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:28,446
AND I SAY I'M NOT HAPPY, WE 

1026
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,714
HAVE ONE OF THE WORST DEALS OF 

1027
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,114
ANY GROUP, WITH THE EUROPEAN 

1028
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:33,783
UNION, AND THEY JUST DIDN'T 

1029
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:34,919
WANT TO COME, BECAUSE THEY WERE 

1030
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,120
HAPPY WITH THE DEAL, AND I SAID 

1031
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,292
WE ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE DEAL, 

1032
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,058
AND FINALLY AFTER GOING THROUGH 

1033
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:44,362
THE WHOLE PROCESS, I SAID WE 

1034
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:48,299
WILL PUT A TAX OF 20% ON 

1035
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:48,932
MERCEDES, BMWS, MILLIONS OF 

1036
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:50,634
CARS THAT THEY SELL HERE, THAT 

1037
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:57,041
THEY WILL TAKE OVER THERE. 

1038
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:57,842
FARM PRODUCT THAT THEY WON'T 

1039
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:58,743
TAKE OVER THERE, THERE ARE 

1040
00:37:58,743 --> 00:37:59,376
BARRIERS, OUR FARMERS AREN'T 

1041
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:00,311
ALLOWED TO SELL OVER THERE, 

1042
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,912
MANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS, MOST OF 

1043
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:06,517
THEM, SO I ANNOUNCED THAT WE 

1044
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,752
WILL PUT A 20% TARIFF, HE COULD 

1045
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,821
BE 25%, ON THEIR CARS COMING IN,

1046
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:11,689
THEY IMMEDIATELY CALLED AND 

1047
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,058
SAID WE WOULD LIKE TO START 

1048
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:17,328
NEGOTIATING, AND WE ARE HAVING 

1049
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,195
SUCCESS, WE WILL SEE WHAT 

1050
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,263
HAPPENS, ALWAYS SAY WHO KNOWS, 

1051
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,431
BUT WE WILL SEE, I HAVE A 

1052
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:24,268
FEELING WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

MARKET IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH, 

1091
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:58,195
THINK OF THAT, OVER 50%, SINCE 

1092
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:04,435
MY LECTION, -- MY ELECTION, THE 

1093
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,270
401(K), THEY WERE DYING WITH 

1094
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,406
THEM FOR YEARS, NOW THEY ARE SO 

1095
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:13,677
HAPPY, I WAS TELLING THE STORY, 

1096
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:14,612
I TELL ABOUT A POLICEMAN NEW 

1097
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,413

1098
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:20,184
ALWAYS IN -- UPSET WITH HIM AS 

1099
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:24,922
AN INVESTOR, BECAUSE HE WASN'T 

1100
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,524
DOING WELL WITH 401(K)S, BUT 

1101
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,260
SHE SAYS HE'S A GENIUS NOW. 

1102
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,727

HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT, IS AT 

1107
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,473
RECORD LOWS IN HISTORY, NOT FOR

00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,010
OF OUR COUNTRY, AFRICAN-

1110
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,813
AMERICAN, ASIAN, HISPANIC, 

1111
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:51,115

1114
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:02,759
IMPORTANT SECTOR. 

1115
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:03,761
THE LOWEST IN HISTORY, IT IS 

1116
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:03,994
GREAT. 

1117
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,262
THIS IS HELPING SO MUCH WITH 

1118
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:10,267
PEOPLE THAT GET OUT OF PRISON, 

1119
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,202
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM, 

1120
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,169
PEOPLE GET OUT OF PRISON, THEY 

1121
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,003
CAN'T GET A JOB, EMPLOYERS 

1122
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,639
DON'T WANT TO HIRE THEM, THE 

1123
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,541
ECONOMY IS SO GOOD, THEY ARE 

1124
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,542
HIRING THEM, AND THEY ARE 

1125
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,710
TURNING OUT TO BE INCREDIBLE 

1126
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,146
WORKERS, THEY ARE GIVEN A 

1127
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:24,248
CHANCE, THEY'RE GIVEN A SECOND 

1128
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,983
CHANCE, A THIRD CHANCE IN SOME 

1129
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,450
CASES, BUT I'VE HAD NUMEROUS 

1130
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,485
EMPLOYERS SAY I TELL YOU WHAT, 

1131
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:30,988
I'VE TAKEN PEOPLE WHO WERE IN 

1132
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:35,092
PRISON, AND WE HAVE HIRED THEM, 

1133
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,293
HE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS IN 

1134
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,661
A NORMAL OR BAD ECONOMY, ONLY 

1135
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,732
IN THIS KIND OF ECONOMY, AND 

1136
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:42,666
NOW HE IS THE BIGGEST FAN, ONE 

1137
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,867
MAN IN PARTICULAR, TAKING 

1138
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:45,569
NUMEROUS PEOPLE, HE SAYS MOST 

1139
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:49,273
OF THEM HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLE, 

1140
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,141
AND THAT IS A GREAT THING, A 

1141
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,509
REALLY GREAT THING. 

1142
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:54,878
IT GIVES THEM A CHANCE.

1143
00:41:54,878 --> 00:41:57,781
>>> SO BEFORE WE TAKE QUESTIONS,

1144
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,082
I WANT TO EXTEND OUR WARMEST 

1145
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:02,686

WORLD, THEY HAVE NOT SEEN IT SO 

1153
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:23,307

00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,000
UNITED STATES, WHEN WE PUT ON A 

1415
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,468
25% TARIFF ON EVERY CAR THAT

00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:23,440
COMES FROM THE UNITED STATES 

1417
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,275

1419
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:30,580

1425
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:46,863

THERE'S NO DEAL, THEY DO 

1429
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,403

1441
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:17,761
TARIFFS ENDED IN 1913. 

1442
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:18,795
AND THEY THEN WENT TO A 

1443
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:22,499
DIFFERENT SYSTEM IN 1919, 

1444
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:26,569
TOTALLY UNRELATED, IN 1928, YOU 

1445
00:53:26,569 --> 00:53:28,305
HAD THE GREAT DEPRESSION, FOR A 

1446
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:32,942
LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS, NOT 

1447
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:33,576
NECESSARILY OUR COUNTRIES WELL, 

1448
00:53:33,576 --> 00:53:34,911
BUT A LITTLE BIT OUR COUNTRY'S 

1449
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,613
FAULT, AND THEN IN THE 1930S, 

1450
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:40,984
THEY SAID WE BETTER START 

1451
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:41,918
CHARGING TARIFFS, WE NEED MONEY 

1452
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,386
TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY AGAIN, 

1453
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:43,586
OKAY? 

1454
00:53:43,586 --> 00:53:44,988
SO I'M NOT ADVOCATING TARIFFS, 

1455
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:51,461
I WILL TELL YOU THIS, OUR 

1456
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:52,229
STEELE INDUSTRY IS STRONGER 

1457
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,597
THAN IT HAS BEEN IN 25 YEARS, 

1458
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,232
TAKING SIX MONTHS, BECAUSE I 

1459
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,535
CHARGED THE DUMPERS, THEY WERE 

1460
00:53:58,535 --> 00:53:59,201
DUMPING STEELE AND ALUMINUM 

1461
00:53:59,201 --> 00:54:02,339
INTO OUR COUNTRY, I CHARGED 

1462
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,540
25%, IT'S A LOT, IT COULD BE 

1463
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,874
MORE, BUT IT'S A LOT, AND IF 

1464
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:09,713
YOU LOOK AT U.S. DEAL, AND NUCOR

1465
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:12,281
JUST ANNOUNCED A $1 BILLION 

1466
00:54:12,281 --> 00:54:18,888
PLAN, U.S. DEAL IS BUILDING 

1467
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,023
EIGHT OR NINE PLANTS, EXPANDING 

1468
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:20,690
THEM, I DON'T THINK THERE IS 

1469
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,557
ANY INDUSTRY WHAT HAS HAPPENED 

1470
00:54:21,557 --> 00:54:23,393
TO STEELE IN THE LAST NINE 

1471
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,061
MONTHS, 10 MONTHS, SINCE I 

1472
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,362
REALLY STARTED DOING WHAT I'M 

1473
00:54:26,362 --> 00:54:27,464
DOING. 

1474
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:30,734
IT HAS BEEN PRETTY AMAZING. 

1475
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,836
ALUMINUM, ALSO. 

1476
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:35,605
WE NEED STEELE, FOR DEFENSE, GO 

1477
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,274
AND GET IT FROM ANOTHER 

1478
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:37,540
COUNTRY? 

1479
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,443
CAN'T DO THAT. 

1480
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:45,048
SO WE NEED STEELE, AND WE NEEDED

1481
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:48,184
BADLY FOR DEFENSE, I AM PROUD 

1482
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:49,853
WILL HAS HAPPENED WITH THE 

1483
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,688
STEELE INDUSTRY. 

1484
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,022
GO AHEAD. 

1485
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:54,590
SHE IS SHOCKED THAT I PICKED 

1486
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:54,958
HER. 

1487
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:59,462
IN A STATE OF SHOCK.>> I'M NOT,

00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,965
THANK YOU.

00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,534
>> GO AHEAD. 

1490
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:10,073
>> IN A TWEET THIS WEEKEND, YOU 

1491
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,374

1492
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:12,309
ARE LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE 

1493
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:12,976
FBI INVESTIGATION.>> WHAT DOES 

1494
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:16,346
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH TRADE?

1495
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:19,883
>> IT HAS TO DO WITH THE BRETT 

1496
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:23,386
KAVANAUGH NOMINATION.

1497
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:26,523
>> I DON'T ANSWER THAT RIGHT 

1498
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:30,826
NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER 

1499
00:55:30,826 --> 00:55:31,093
QUESTION? 

1500
00:55:31,093 --> 00:55:32,629
>> DO YOU THINK IT WILL GET 

1501
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:33,562
THROUGH CONGRESS? 

1502
00:55:33,562 --> 00:55:35,965
>> IT IS FAIR ON BOTH SIDES, 

1503
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,300
INDUSTRY LOVES IT, BUT 

1504
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:42,371
REPUBLICANS LOVE IT, IF IT IS 

1505
00:55:42,371 --> 00:55:43,540
FAIR, IT WILL PASS, I THINK IT 

1506
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,108
WILL PASS REALLY EASILY, IT'S A 

1507
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,109
GREAT DEAL, NAFTA PASSED, ONE 

1508
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,544
OF THE WORST DEALS I'VE EVER 

1509
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,779
SEEN, INCONCEIVABLE THAT IT WAS 

1510
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:49,979
MADE. 

1511
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:52,515
I WILL GET BACK TO YOU YOU ON 

1512
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:55,418
THE KAVANAUGH THING. 

1513
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:57,654
I WILL CALL YOU A SECOND TIME, 

1514
00:55:57,654 --> 00:55:59,355
GO AHEAD, PLEASE.

1515
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:04,160
>> YOU HAVE DESCRIBED INDIA AS 

1516
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,597
A TIER OF KING, CAN YOU 

1517
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:07,864
EXPLAIN? 

1518
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:12,302
>> INDIA CHARGES TREMENDOUS 

1519
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,336
TARIFFS, IF WE SEND HARLEY-

1520
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:14,003
DAVIDSON'S, MOTORCYCLES, OTHER 

1521
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,038
THINGS TO INDIA, THEY CHARGE 

1522
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,941
VERY HIGH TARIFFS, I'VE TALKED 

1523
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,309
TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND HE 

1524
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,678
WILL REDUCE THEM TREMENDOUSLY, 

1525
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:24,180
HE SAID NOBODY EVER SPOKE TO ME.

1526
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,715
IN OTHER WORDS, WE'VE HAD 

1527
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,451
LEADERS HERE, I'M NOT TRYING TO 

1528
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:32,355
BE OVERLY DRAMATIC, WE'VE HAD 

1529
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,222
PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES 

1530
00:56:33,222 --> 00:56:34,824
AND TRADE REPRESENTATIVES, THEY 

1531
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,759
NEVER SPOKE TO INDIA, BRAZIL'S 

1532
00:56:36,759 --> 00:56:40,029
ANOTHER ONE, THAT'S A BEAUTY, 

1533
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:41,865
THEY CHARGES WHATEVER THEY WANT.

1534
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,867
IF YOU ASK SOME OF THE 

1535
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,568
COMPANIES, THEY SAY BRAZIL IS 

1536
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,103
ONE OF THE TOUGHEST IN THE 

1537
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,739
WORLD, WE DON'T CALL THEM AND 

1538
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,409
SAY HEY, YOU ARE TREATING ARE 

1539
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,043
COMPANIES UNFAIRLY, OUR COUNTRY 

1540
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:59,148
UNFAIRLY, INDIA IS A VERY HIGH 

1541
00:56:59,148 --> 00:56:59,749
TARIFF COUNTRY. 

1542
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,985
ON MOTORCYCLES, IT WAS 100%. 

1543
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:04,254
IF YOU SEND A MOTORCYCLE TO 

1544
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,423
INDIA, THERE IS A 100% TARIFF, 

1545
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:08,791
THAT IS SO HIGH, IT'S LIKE A 

1546
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:11,194
BARRIER, IN OTHER WORDS, WHOSE 

1547
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:14,030
GOING TO BUY IT. 

1548
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,064
THEY HAVE REDUCED IT 

1549
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,165
SUBSTANTIALLY, BUT STILL TOO 

1550
00:57:16,165 --> 00:57:17,634
HIGH. 

1551
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:20,003
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA IS 

1552
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:24,207
GREAT, WITH PRIME MINISTER -- 

1553
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,876
THE PRIME MINISTER. THEY CALLED 

1554
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,979
US TO MAKE A DEAL, SHOCKING TO 

1555
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,047
PEOPLE. 

1556
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:35,485
GO AHEAD.

1557
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:39,789
>> I DO HAVE A SECOND QUESTION 

1558
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,824
ON THE KAVANAUGH THING WHEN YOU 

1559
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,859
GET BACK TO IT. 

1560
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:44,093
YOU WILL TAKE THAT NOW? 

1561
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:48,231
>> NO, LET'S STAY ON TRADE.

1562
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,133
>> DOES THIS MEAN THE END OF 

1563
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,968
TARIFFS, IF YOU CAN SPELL THAT 

1564
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:52,634
OUT FOR CANADA? 

1565
00:57:52,634 --> 00:57:57,273
DO YOU THINK IT WILL PASS?

1566
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,341
>> NO, THE STEAL IS STAYING 

1567
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,976
WHERE IT IS, AND ALUMINUM, BUT 

1568
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,078
IT MEANS WE PROBABLY FOR THE 

1569
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:04,914
MOST PART WON'T BE NEEDING TO 

1570
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:06,115
USE TARIFFS, IF WE CAN'T MAKE A 

1571
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:07,851
DEAL WITH THE EU, WE WILL 

1572
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:08,618
RESPECTFULLY PUT TARIFFS ON THE 

1573
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:15,391
CARS, THE UNITED STATES WILL 

1574
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:16,426
TAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO 

1575
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:17,727
ITS COFFERS, YOU DON'T HEAR 

1576
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:21,564
THAT.

1577
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:24,601
>> ONLY FROM CARL SAVING --

CARL SAGAN.

1579
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:31,174
>> YES, HIM, THEY WON'T HAVE TO 

1580
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:35,578
PAY THE 20% OR 25% TAX. 

1581
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:36,679
THERE WILL BE CASES WORRY OF 

1582
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,482
COUNTRIES THAT WILL BE NOT 

1583
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:44,120
WILLING TO DO WHAT IS FAIR AND 

1584
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,922
RECIPROCAL, AND IN THAT CASE 

1585
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:46,956
THEY WILL PAY TARIFFS, AND THE 

1586
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,524
U.S. WILL DO VERY WELL, EITHER 

1587
00:58:48,524 --> 00:58:51,928
WAY.

1588
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,229
>> DO YOU THINK IT WILL PASS IN 

1589
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:53,997
CANADA AND MEXICO, AND MORE 

1590
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,097
IMPORTANTLY HERE IN THE UNITED 

1591
00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:56,099
STATES?>> I DON'T KNOW, WE MADE 

1592
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:01,871
A GOOD DEAL, THE PRIME MINISTER,

1593
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:02,906
THEY ARE SATISFIED WITH THE 

1594
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:07,944
DEAL, GOOD FOR CANADA, MEXICO, 

1595
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:08,745
GOOD FOR ALL THREE. 

1596
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:09,845
THIS IS GOOD FOR ALL THREE, AND 

1597
00:59:09,845 --> 00:59:10,846
JUST THAT FACT MAKES IT GOOD 

1598
00:59:10,846 --> 00:59:12,615
FOR US, BUT THIS IS GOOD FOR 

1599
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:15,051
ALL THREE, THIS IS A MUCH 

1600
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,253
DIFFERENT DEAL THAN NAFTA, MUCH 

1601
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:19,622
MORE OF A RECIPROCAL DEAL FOR 

1602
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,024
THE UNITED STATES, WHICH IS 

1603
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:21,791
GOOD. 

1604
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:27,530

00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:35,972
HARSHLY, WE WILL DO THAT IN A 

1609
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:36,405
COUPLE OF MINUTES. 

1610
00:59:36,405 --> 00:59:39,242
LET'S FINISH UP TRADE, WE'VE 

1611
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,543

RUN TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 

1613
00:59:42,311 --> 00:59:45,448

00:59:51,987 --> 00:59:52,955
>> YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP THE 

1618
00:59:52,955 --> 00:59:54,323
TARIFFS ON STEELE ON MEXICO AND 

1619
00:59:54,323 --> 00:59:54,556
CANADA? 

1620
00:59:54,556 --> 00:59:55,558
>> UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT WE CAN 

1621
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:58,361
DO SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 

1622
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,229
DIFFERENT, LIKE QUARTERS, SO 

1623
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:02,031
THAT OUR INDUSTRY IS PROTECTED, 

1624
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:03,333
WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW OUR 

1625
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,002
STEELE INDUSTRY DOES DISAPPEAR, 

1626
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:08,104
IT WAS ALMOST GONE, I TELL YOU 

1627
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,872
WHAT, IF OUR COUNTRY KEPT GOING 

1628
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,874
THE WAY IT WAS GOING, WITHIN 

1629
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:13,009
TWO YEARS YOU WOULDN'T OF HAD A 

1630
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,477
STEELE INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO 

1631
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:15,911
HAVE THAT, SOME INDUSTRIES ARE 

1632
01:00:15,911 --> 01:00:20,683
IMPORTANT, WE ARE WORKING ON 

1633
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,419
THAT NOW, THAT WAS NOT PART OF 

1634
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:24,820
THIS, IN FACT BOB, YOU MIGHT 

1635
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,289
WANT TO SAY A COUPLE OF WORDS 

1636
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,156
ABOUT THAT, LITERALLY WE WERE 

1637
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:28,524
TALKING ABOUT THAT ONE HOUR 

1638
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:28,724
AGO? 

1639
01:00:28,724 --> 01:00:33,062
>> THANK YOU, FIRST OF ALL, TWO 

1640
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:34,664
SEPARATE THINGS AS FAR AS WE 

1641
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:38,835
ARE CONCERNED, WE KNOW THERE 

1642
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:39,902
ARE OF GREAT INTEREST TO BOTH 

1643
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:40,770
COUNTRIES, WE ARE ENGAGING IN 

1644
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,238
TALKS WITH AN EFFORT TO 

1645
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:43,106
PRESERVE THE EFFECT OF OUR 

1646
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,707
PROGRAM AND STILL TAKE CARE OF 

1647
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:46,375
THEIR NEEDS, AND HOPEFULLY WE 

1648
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:47,477
WILL BE ABLE TO WORK THAT OUT, 

1649
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,879
WE ARE IN COMMUNICATION.

1650
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:51,080
>> AND TAKE CARE OF THE NEEDS 

1651
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,217
OF OUR STEELE COMPANIES, I 

1652
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:58,087
DON'T WANT PLANTS CLOSING, THEY 

1653
01:00:58,087 --> 01:00:59,022
ARE HIRING THOUSANDS OF WORKERS 

1654
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:00,055
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 

1655
01:01:00,055 --> 01:01:04,427
>> THE ASSURANCES WERE GIVEN TO 

1656
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:05,661
LOPEZ OBRADOR. 

1657
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:07,196
>> WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD 

1658
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:08,131
UNDERSTANDING. 

1659
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:13,136
GO AHEAD, PLEASE.

1660
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:13,970
>> JUST HOPING YOU CAN 

1661
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,705
REITERATE ON THE TARIFFS, WHAT 

1662
01:01:16,705 --> 01:01:18,141
SPECIFICALLY WOULD IT TAKE FOR 

1663
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,076
CANADA OR MEXICO TO BE EXEMPT 

1664
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:21,010
FROM THESE TARIFFS? 

1665
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:26,549
AND SECONDLY, DID YOU CONSIDER 

1666
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:27,783
DAIRY AS THE DEALBREAKER? 

1667
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:30,153
>> YES, FOR OUR FARMERS, IT HAS 

1668
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,354
OPENED UP MUCH MORE. 

1669
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:37,126
I KNOW THEY CAN'T OPEN IT 

1670
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:37,894
COMPLETELY, THEY HAVE FARMERS, 

1671
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,563
ALSO, THEY CAN'T BE OVERRUN, I 

1672
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:41,464
DO UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE LIMITS, 

1673
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,332
BUT THEY COULD DO BETTER, WE 

1674
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,934
HAVE OPENED IT UP FOR OUR 

1675
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:46,735
FARMERS, SO THE FOLKS UP IN 

1676
01:01:46,735 --> 01:01:49,739
WISCONSIN, I WENT TO WISCONSIN, 

1677
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:56,012
IOWA, JONI KNOWS BETTER THAN 

1678
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,179
ANYBODY, AND SCOTT WALKER, I 

1679
01:01:57,179 --> 01:02:01,184
THINK IS A FANTASTIC GOVERNOR, 

1680
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:02,051
TALKS ABOUT IS ALL THE TIME, 

1681
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,053
THAT OUR FARMERS WERE NOT 

1682
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:06,289
TREATED WELL, THEY WILL BE 

1683
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:09,625
TREATED WITH RESPECT AND FAIRLY.

1684
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,294
AS I SAY, IN THAT RECIPROCAL 

1685
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:12,428
WAY, VERY IMPORTANT. 

1686
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:12,695
GO AHEAD. 

1687
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:18,034
>> THANK YOU, SEEING THAT THERE 

1688
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:18,734
WAS GIVE-AND-TAKE ON BOTH 

1689
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:21,871
SIDES, I WONDER WHAT WOULD BE 

1690
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:22,971
YOUR BIGGEST CONCESSION TO 

1691
01:02:22,971 --> 01:02:25,975
CANADA, AND WHY YOU DECIDED TO 

1692
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,009
MAKE THAT CONCESSION? 

1693
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:32,715
IF YOU COULD DIVE A BIT MORE 

1694
01:02:32,715 --> 01:02:33,583
INTO YOUR THOUGHTS ON JUSTIN 

1695
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,250
TRUDEAU, THE TENSIONS, 

1696
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:34,883
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, WHAT 

1697
01:02:34,883 --> 01:02:38,554
YOU HAVE LEARNED ABOUT HIM, AND 

1698
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:39,455
WHAT THE STATE OF THE 

1699
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:40,456
RELATIONSHIP IS WITH HIM TODAY 

1700
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,191
AND GOING FORWARD?

1701
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:43,025
>> MY BIGGEST CONCESSION WOULD 

1702
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:45,762
BE MAKING THE DEAL. 

1703
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,830
BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONE THAT 

1704
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,865
PEOPLE COME AND WANT TO TAKE 

1705
01:02:49,865 --> 01:02:51,967
FROM. 

1706
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:53,269
I AM TALKING ABOUT EVERY 

1707
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,137
COUNTRY. 

1708
01:02:55,137 --> 01:02:58,975
THAT GIVES US A TREMENDOUS 

1709
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,009
ADVANTAGE IN NEGOTIATING THAT 

1710
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:01,978
WE NEVER USED BEFORE WITH PAST 

1711
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,379
ADMINISTRATIONS. 

1712
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:04,680
WE NEVER USED IT, EVERY DEAL WE 

1713
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,249
HAVE IS A LOSER, YOU CAN LOOK 

1714
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:07,683
AT ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN THE 

1715
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,618
WORLD, WE HAVE TRADE DEFICITS, 

1716
01:03:09,618 --> 01:03:10,887
WE LOSE WITH EVERYBODY. 

1717
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,255
I THINK MY BIGGEST CONCESSION 

1718
01:03:13,255 --> 01:03:15,658
WAS MAKING THE DEAL. 

1719
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,226
BECAUSE WE COULD'VE DONE IT A 

1720
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:20,630
DIFFERENT WAY, BUT IT WOULD 

1721
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,697
HAVE BEEN NASTY AND NOT NICE, I 

1722
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:22,732
DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT, WE 

1723
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,266
HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP, I 

1724
01:03:24,266 --> 01:03:25,801
THINK IT WILL BE BETTER THAN 

1725
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:28,204
EVER NOW, THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH 

1726
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:29,071
JUSTIN, HE LOVES HIS PEOPLE, 

1727
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:34,577
HE'S FIGHTING HARD WITH THIS -- 

1728
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:35,878
FOR HIS PEOPLE, WE HAVE HAD A 

1729
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:37,146
GOOD RELATIONSHIP, IT GOT A 

1730
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,180
LITTLE BIT TESTING THE LAST 

1731
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,449
COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT THAT WAS 

1732
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:41,951
OVER THIS AGREEMENT. 

1733
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:44,820
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. 

1734
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,555
I THINK JUSTIN IS A GOOD PERSON 

1735
01:03:46,555 --> 01:03:50,225
WHO IS DOING A GOOD JOB. 

1736
01:03:50,225 --> 01:03:51,360
HE FELT VERY COMMITTED TO HIS 

1737
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,565
PEOPLE, THAT'S WHAT HE DID. 

1738
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:56,432
AGAIN, THIS IS GOOD FOR 

1739
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:57,400
EVERYBODY, GOOD FOR CANADA AND 

1740
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:57,967
MEXICO ALSO. 

1741
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:58,834
YES, PLEASE. 

1742
01:03:58,834 --> 01:04:00,102
GO AHEAD.

1743
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:05,208
>> THANK YOU, AS YOU MENTIONED, 

1744
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,008
YOU WILL BE SIGNING THE 

1745
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:06,641
AGREEMENT, AND COUNTERPARTS 

1746
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:08,411
WILL BE SIGNING IT IN THE NEXT 

1747
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,180
60 DAYS, THEN IT IS UP TO 

1748
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,014
CONGRESS, YOU ARE VERY 

1749
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,782
CONFIDENT, I GET THAT.

1750
01:04:13,782 --> 01:04:18,354
>> I AM NOT AT ALL CONGERS -- I 

1751
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,156
AM NOT AT ALL CONFIDENT. 

1752
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:23,625
CONGRESS, ARE YOU WILLING TO DO 

1753
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:24,060
IT?

1754
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:27,797
>> THE CONGRESS COULD BE 

1755
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:31,133
CONTROLLED BY DEMOCRATS. 

1756
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:32,735
>> THEY MAY BE WILLING TO DO 

1757
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:34,870
THAT FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES, FOR

1758
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:39,642
THAT, FRANKLY, THEY WILL HAVE 

1759
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:44,246
2020 IN MIND, THE DREAM FOR 

1760
01:04:44,246 --> 01:04:47,783
2020, THEY WANT TO DO AS WELL 

1761
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,919
AS THEY CAN, SO TRYING TO 

1762
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,620
REJECT EVEN GREAT DEALS, A 

1763
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:55,057
GREAT DEAL FOR A COUNTRY IN 

1764
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,425
OTHER COUNTRIES, AND OUR 

1765
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:59,195
WORKERS, I CAN TELL YOU WHETHER 

1766
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:02,130
OR NOT THEY WILL OBSTRUCT OR 

1767
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:05,801
RESIST, THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN IS 

1768
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,203
RESIST, I SEE THE SIGNS, THEY 

1769
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:11,607
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE 

1770
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:12,641
RESISTING, YOU ASKED THEM WHAT 

1771
01:05:12,641 --> 01:05:14,010
ARE THEY RESISTING, THEY SAY I 

1772
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:16,412
DON'T KNOW, THEY SAID WHAT ARE 

1773
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,546
YOU RESISTING, AND THEY WERE 

1774
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:23,252
UNABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. 

1775
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,286
SO I CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT 

1776
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:26,055
DELAY, OBSTRUCT, RESIST, AFTER 

1777
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,124
THE SELECTION, AND I THINK WE 

1778
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:29,458
WILL DO WELL, ALTHOUGH HISTORY 

1779
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:38,734
<font color="#FF0000"><u>S NOT ON OUR SIDE, AND </u></font>

1780
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:39,401
HISTORY, GENERALLY WHOEVER HAS 

1781
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:40,369
THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN'T DO WELL 

1782
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:41,370
IN MIDTERMS, BUT THE ONE 

1783
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:42,305
DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE HAVE THE 

1784
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:43,139
GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY 

1785
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,373
OF OUR COUNTRY, THAT IS A BIG 

1786
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:44,673
DIFFERENCE. 

1787
01:05:44,673 --> 01:05:45,674
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS, 

1788
01:05:45,674 --> 01:05:49,178
AND PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR ME, 

1789
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:50,112
I'M NOT ON THE TICKET, BUT 

1790
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:51,380
CONGRESS IS ON THE TICKET, I 

1791
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,748
TRY TO TELL MY PEOPLE THAT IS 

1792
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,784
THE SAME THING AS ME, IN A 

1793
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,218
SENSE, THINK OF IT AS THE SAME 

1794
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:58,821
THING AS ME. 

1795
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:02,959
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL,

1796
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,093
WE HAVE SENATE RACES THAT WERE 

1797
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:06,395
NOT EVEN IN PLAY SIX MONTHS AGO,

1798
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:07,596
WHEN I STARTED LOOKING AT IT 

1799
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,165
CLOSELY, I WON'T MENTION NAMES, 

1800
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:10,599
BUT SENATORS THAT WERE NOT IN 

1801
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:12,367
PLAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING 

1802
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:15,805
ABOUT, NUMEROUS ONES, THEY WERE 

1803
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,442
NOT IN PLAY, IN OTHER WORDS, 

1804
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:20,409
LET'S NOT GO HERE, THIS DAY, 

1805
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:24,413
FOR FIVE STATES, THERE LIKE 

1806
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:25,648
EVEN RACES, IN ONE CASE OF TWO 

1807
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,015
POINTS, BUT WHO KNOWS, AS YOU 

1808
01:06:27,015 --> 01:06:31,453
KNOW, A LOT OF REPRESSION 

1809
01:06:31,453 --> 01:06:33,022
POLES, OR ONES THAT ARE NOT 

1810
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:42,865
VERY ACCURATE, -- POLLS. WE HAD 

1811
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:46,135
CONGRESSIONAL SEATS, TOO. 

1812
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:47,770
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING 

1813
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:51,073
ON, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE 

1814
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:52,041
BROADCAST THAT WAY, BUT I HAD 

1815
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:52,774
THAT WITH MY ELECTION. 

1816
01:06:52,774 --> 01:06:54,410
THEY WERE TELLING ME I WAS IN 

1817
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,112
TROUBLE IN CERTAIN STATES, AND 

1818
01:06:56,112 --> 01:07:01,384
I END UP WINNING IN A LANDSLIDE.

1819
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:03,052
AND I KNEW I WAS GOING TO, BUT 

1820
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:03,986
THEY WOULD NOT REPORT IT THAT 

1821
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:05,387
WAY, DO YOU KNOW WHY? 

1822
01:07:05,387 --> 01:07:06,822
FAKE NEWS. 

1823
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,024
RIGHT BEHIND YOU. 

1824
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:12,528
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THE TRADE 

1825
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:13,596
AGREEMENT WILL BE A MAJOR ISSUE 

1826
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:14,396
IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS?>> IT 

1827
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:20,036
SHOULD BE, IT IS A GOOD 

1828
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:20,970
AGREEMENT. 

1829
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:21,770
SOME PEOPLE SAID EXTEND NAFTA, 

1830
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,973
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A DISASTER, 

1831
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:27,343
WE ARE LOSING $100 BILLION A 

1832
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,211
YEAR IN DEFICITS, AT LEAST, TO 

1833
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,881
MEXICO, UNDER NAFTA, BUT JUST 

1834
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:35,918
LOOK AT THE RESULTS, AND A 

1835
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:36,585
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT TO CANADA, 

1836
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:38,487
ALTHOUGH PEOPLE SAY IT'S EVEN, 

1837
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,089
IT'S NOT EVEN, WE LOSE A 

1838
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:41,290
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT. 

1839
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,092
IT IS A HARD THING TO DEFEND. 

1840
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,528
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND 

1841
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:46,462
THE WORLD OF POLITICS I THINK 

1842
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:50,599
AS WELL AS ANYBODY, I HAVEN'T 

1843
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:51,600
BEEN DOING IT THAT LONG, BUT 

1844
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,434
ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN, I'VE BEEN 

1845
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:54,170
DOING IT ON THE OTHER SIDE, I 

1846
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,504
DO UNDERSTAND, THEY CAN TAKE 

1847
01:07:55,504 --> 01:08:05,514
THE GREATEST THING EVER DONE, 

1848
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:06,916
AND TRY TO MAKE IT SOUND AS BAD 

1849
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:07,249
AS POSSIBLE. 

1850
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,283
THIS ONE IS TOUGH, PEOPLE ARE 

1851
01:08:08,283 --> 01:08:09,318
COMING OUT FOR THIS ONE AND 

1852
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,085
SAYING THAT IS INCREDIBLE WHAT 

1853
01:08:10,085 --> 01:08:11,220
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. 

1854
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:11,620
YES, BEHIND YOU? 

1855
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,688
>> THANK YOU, NOW THAT YOU HAVE 

1856
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:13,422
ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS ON 

1857
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:16,425
TRADE, I WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO 

1858
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,194
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

1859
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:20,696
>> WE WILL DO ONE MORE QUESTION 

1860
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:23,399
ON TRADE. 

1861
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,500
SOMEBODY IS BEFORE YOU, EXCUSE 

1862
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,100
ME, DON'T DO THAT, DO YOU HAVE 

1863
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,636
A QUESTION ON TRADE?

1864
01:08:28,636 --> 01:08:30,839
>> MY QUESTION IS ON JUDGE 

1865
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:35,077
KAVANAUGH, YOU SAID THE FBI 

1866
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:38,080
SHOULD INTERVIEW ANYBODY WHO IS 

1867
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,819
APPROPRIATE, DOES THAT INCLUDE 

1868
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:47,823
JULIE SWETNICK? 

1869
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:52,727
>> CAN YOU DO A QUESTION, ON 

1870
01:08:52,727 --> 01:08:55,564
TRADE? 

1871
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:59,502
>> AND THE WALL, OUT DOES IT 

1872
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:00,469
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE 

1873
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:01,837
TRADE AGREEMENT QUICK 

1874
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:03,439
>> WE'VE GOTTEN ONE $.6 

1875
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:08,877
BILLION, WE'VE DONE A LOT OF 

1876
01:09:08,877 --> 01:09:09,912
WORK, I CAN BUILD IT QUICKLY AT 

1877
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:10,912
ONE TIME, WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING 

1878
01:09:10,912 --> 01:09:14,283
IT OVER THE LAST ONE HALF YEARS,

1879
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:15,317
WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE $.6 

1880
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,587
BILLION, I'VE GOT A BIG 

1881
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:19,455
DECISION TO MAKE AFTER THE 

1882
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:20,421
ELECTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT 

1883
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:26,328
WE GO FORWARD, BECAUSE YOU KNOW 

1884
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,194
WHAT, BORDER SECURITY TO THE 

1885
01:09:27,194 --> 01:09:27,997
PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY, VERY 

1886
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,064
IMPORTANT, THE WALL IS A BIG 

1887
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:29,298
FACTOR. 

1888
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:32,167
I BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE OF 

1889
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:35,170
OUR COUNTRY, THEY DON'T WANT 

1890
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:41,042
CRIME POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY, 

1891
01:09:41,042 --> 01:09:41,910
THEY DON'T ONE MS-13 POURING 

1892
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:42,778
INTO HER COUNTRY, THEY DON'T 

1893
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:45,080
WANT THAT, AND I THINK I HAVE A 

1894
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,482
BIG DECISION TO MAKE SOME TIME 

1895
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:48,184
AFTER THE ELECTION, VERY 

1896
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,318
QUICKLY, BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT 

1897
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,754
COMES DUE AFTER THE ELECTION, 

1898
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:56,158
DO I WANT TO DO IT BEFORE THE 

1899
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:58,861
ELECTION? 

1900
01:09:58,861 --> 01:09:59,695
PERSONALLY, YES, BUT I DON'T 

1901
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:00,729
WANT TO DO IT FOR ANOTHER 

1902
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:01,696
REASON, I HAVE VERY FINE PEOPLE 

1903
01:10:01,696 --> 01:10:02,631
RUNNING IN CLOSE ELECTIONS, IT 

1904
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:03,666
MAY AFFECT THEM, I HAPPEN TO 

1905
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,034
THINK IT WILL BE GOOD FOR THEM. 

1906
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:08,037
OUR PEOPLE ONE SECURITY, THE 

1907
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,204
WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY ONE 

1908
01:10:09,204 --> 01:10:10,439
SECURITY. 

1909
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:11,106
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE 

1910
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:13,943
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE POURING 

1911
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:14,443
ACROSS THE BORDER. 

1912
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:16,011
AND I TELL YOU WHAT, THEY WANT 

1913
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:17,479
TO HAVE EYES, BECAUSE THEY WALK 

1914
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:21,684
INTO THESE GANGS, AND THEY 

1915
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:22,685
TREAT THEM LIKE IS JUST ANOTHER 

1916
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,453
DAY IN THE OFFICE. 

1917
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,055
THEY ARE ROUGH AND TOUGH, THEY 

1918
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:31,493
LOVE OUR COUNTRY, I'M TREATING 

1919
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:32,461
ICE GOOD, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1920
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:33,195
GOOD, THE DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT 

1921
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,063
TO TAKE CARE OF LAW 

1922
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,598
ENFORCEMENT, OR THE MILITARY, 

1923
01:10:36,598 --> 01:10:38,067
SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A 

1924
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,035
DECISION TO MAKE, VERY CLOSE TO 

1925
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:42,404
AFTER THE ELECTION IS OVER, AND 

1926
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,472
THAT WILL BE ON BORDER SECURITY 

1927
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,741
AND THE WALL, BUT BORDER 

1928
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:50,145
SECURITY, THE WAS A BIG FACTOR.

1929
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:51,180
>> WAS THAT PART OF THE 

1930
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,281
CONVERSATION AND THE 

1931
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:52,681
NEGOTIATION QUICK 

1932
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:54,049
>> YES IT WAS, WE TALKED ABOUT 

1933
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:57,052
IT WITH MEXICO, A BIG PART, 

1934
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:58,220
CERTAIN THINGS AND 

1935
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:59,788
UNDERSTANDINGS WERE HAD, WE 

1936
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:02,057
DON'T WANT TO MIX IT UP TOO 

1937
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:03,559
MUCH, THIS IS A VERY BIG DEAL 

1938
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:04,626
AND A GOOD DEAL FOR EVERYBODY, 

1939
01:11:04,626 --> 01:11:07,129
BUT BORDER SECURITY, AND 

1940
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:08,430
SECURITY GENERALLY IS A BIG 

1941
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:13,202
FACTOR, AND ALSO WE HAVE DRUGS, 

1942
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:14,069
SOMETIMES, SOME PEOPLE SAY IT'S 

1943
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,604
A VERY SIMILAR THING, TALKED 

1944
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:18,907
ABOUT DRUGS WITH MEXICO, A VERY 

1945
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:19,808
BIG FACTOR. 

1946
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:23,412
VERY BIG, A LOT OF GOOD 

1947
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:24,012
UNDERSTANDINGS, WE WILL BE 

1948
01:11:24,012 --> 01:11:25,948
DISCUSSING THAT WITH THEM. 

1949
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,383
IT WAS A FACTOR, ABSOLUTELY, IN 

1950
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:29,618
THE DEAL.

1951
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:36,058
>>> OKAY, LET'S GO, PEOPLE ARE 

1952
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:36,759
FALLING ASLEEP WITH TRADE I 

1953
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:37,693
GUESS, TO MEETS THE MOST 

1954
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,128
EXCITING THING YOU CAN TALK 

1955
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,295
ABOUT, RIGHT? 

1956
01:11:40,295 --> 01:11:43,899
JONI?

1957
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:49,772
>> YOU SAID THAT IS CORRECT TO 

1958
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:51,206
SAY THAT YOU ARE LIMITING THE 

1959
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,140
FBI RELATIONSHIP -- 

1960
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:55,611
INVESTIGATION, WHICH IS IT, 

1961
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:59,448
LIMITED IN SCOPE?

1962
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:00,481
>> I SAID LET THE SENATE 

1963
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:01,417
DECIDE, WHATEVER THEY WANT TO 

1964
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,118
DO IS OKAY WITH ME, AND ALSO 

1965
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:05,520
THE FBI, THEY SHOULD DO WHAT 

1966
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,256
THEY HAVE TO DO, TO GET TO THE 

1967
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:07,489
ANSWER. 

1968
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,957
AT THE SAME TIME, JUST SO WE 

1969
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:11,727
UNDERSTAND, THIS IS OUR SEVENTH 

1970
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:14,896
INVESTIGATION OF A MAN WHO HAS 

1971
01:12:14,896 --> 01:12:18,700
REALLY -- YOU LOOK AT HIS LIFE, 

1972
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:23,038
UNTIL THIS HAPPENED, WHAT A 

1973
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:23,872
CHANGE HAS GONE THROUGH, WHAT 

1974
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:25,274
HIS FAMILY HAS GONE THROUGH, 

1975
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:29,044
THE TRAUMA, FOR A MAN THAT HAS 

1976
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:31,213
NEVER HAD ANY ACCUSATION, HE'S 

1977
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:34,149
NEVER HAD A BAD STATEMENT ABOUT 

1978
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:35,617
THEM, I THINK HE WAS NUMBER 1 

1979
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,152
IN HIS CLASS AT YALE, NUMBER 1 

1980
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:40,522
IN HIS LAW SCHOOL AT YALE, AND 

1981
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:41,623
THEN WHAT HE HAS GONE THROUGH 

1982
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:43,057
OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS, IS 

1983
01:12:43,057 --> 01:12:48,330
INCREDIBLE. 

1984
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,698
SO I WANT THE FBI, THIS IS NOW 

1985
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:50,499
THE SEVENTH INVESTIGATION, IT'S 

1986
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:53,802
NOT LIKE THEY'RE JUST STARTING, 

1987
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:54,937
I WANT THEM TO DO A VERY 

1988
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:55,971
COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION, 

1989
01:12:55,971 --> 01:13:00,843
WHATEVER THAT MEANS ACCORDING TO

1990
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:02,110
THE SENATORS AND THE 

1991
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:04,646
REPUBLICANS, AND THE REPUBLICAN 

1992
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,216
MAJORITY, I WANT THEM TO DO 

1993
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,850
THAT, I WANTED TO BE 

1994
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,919
COMPREHENSIVE, I THINK IT'S A 

1995
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,588
GOOD THING FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 

1996
01:13:13,588 --> 01:13:19,261
NOT A BAD THING, A GOOD THING, 

1997
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,229
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I WOULD 

1998
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,497
LIKE IT TO GO QUICKLY, AND THE 

1999
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:22,497
REASON IS VERY SIMPLE, SO 

2000
01:13:22,497 --> 01:13:23,399
SIMPLE, BECAUSE IT IS UNFAIR TO 

2001
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,467
HIM AT THIS POINT. 

2002
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:28,337
WHAT HIS WIFE IS GOING THROUGH, 

2003
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:31,607
WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN ARE 

2004
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:32,707
GOING THROUGH, IS NOT 

2005
01:13:32,707 --> 01:13:33,108
DESCRIBABLE. 

2006
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:34,342
IT IS NOT DESCRIBABLE. 

2007
01:13:34,342 --> 01:13:38,280
IT IS NOT FAIR. 

2008
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,648
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO DO TO ME, 

2009
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:41,383
I'VE BEEN GOING FROM DAY ONE, 

2010
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:42,484
LONG BEFORE I GOT TO OFFICE, 

2011
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:45,687
YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT, I THINK 

2012
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,122
FOR ME IT'S LIKE A PART OF MY 

2013
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:50,158
JOB DESCRIPTION, TO HANDLE THIS 

2014
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:56,231
CRAP, BUT AS FAR AS -- THIS IS 

2015
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:57,633
A MAN, IT IS NOT FROM HIS 

2016
01:13:57,633 --> 01:13:59,535
WORLD, IF THEY ARE NOT GOING TO 

2017
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:02,838
WANT HIM, AND I THINK THAT 

2018
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:03,972
WOULD BE A SHAME, I'M WITH THEM 

2019
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:06,375
ALL THE WAY, THE CHARGE MADE, 

2020
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,410
OR SAID TO HAVE OCCURRED, 36 

2021
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:11,880
YEARS AGO, AND NOTHING HAPPENED 

2022
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,716
SINCE, AND I FEEL BADLY FOR ALL 

2023
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:16,285
PARTIES. 

2024
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,753
I FEEL BADLY FOR EVERYBODY, I 

2025
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:20,822
FEEL BADLY FOR COUNTRY, SO BAD 

2026
01:14:20,822 --> 01:14:21,857
FOR OUR COUNTRY, BUT I WILL 

2027
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:23,859
TELL YOU, I WATCHED THOSE 

2028
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:26,628
SENATORS ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE, 

2029
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,130
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A 

2030
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,498
DISGRACE, AND PARTIALLY BECAUSE 

2031
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,934
I KNOW THEM, I KNOW THEM TOO 

2032
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:32,968
WELL, AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY 

2033
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:37,806
ARE NOT ANGELS.

2034
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:38,841
>> ARE YOU'RE SAYING YOUR WHITE 

2035
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,041
HOUSE IS PUT NO LIMITATIONS? 

2036
01:14:40,041 --> 01:14:40,909
>> WE ARE DOING WHATEVER THE 

2037
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:41,610
CENTER IS ONE. 

2038
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:45,881
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M 

2039
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:46,782
SAYING, YOU DO UNDERSTAND, YOU 

2040
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:47,816
JUST DON'T WANT TO REPORT IT 

2041
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,184
THAT WAY, MY WHITE HOUSE WILL 

2042
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:51,553
DO WHATEVER THE SENATORS ONCE. 

2043
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:55,190
I AM OPEN TO WHATEVER THEY WANT,

2044
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:59,895
THE ONE THING I WANT TO SAY, 

2045
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:01,163
THIS STARTED ON FRIDAY, THEY 

2046
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:04,433
HAVE WORKED ROUND-THE-CLOCK ON 

2047
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:05,434
SATURDAY, SUNDAY, THEY ARE 

2048
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:08,337
WORKING RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE 

2049
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,905
COVERING A LOT OF TERRITORY. 

2050
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,106
THIS IS THE SEVENTH 

2051
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:14,042
INVESTIGATION OF JUDGE 

2052
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:21,149
KAVANAUGH. 

2053
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:22,183
THEY STARTED ON FRIDAY, THE GUN 

2054
01:15:22,183 --> 01:15:23,218
LATE INTO THE EVENINGS, THE FBI 

2055
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:25,287
IS REALLY WORKING HARD, PUTTING 

2056
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:28,456
IN A LOT OF HOURS, SO HOPEFULLY 

2057
01:15:28,456 --> 01:15:29,558
THEY CAN COME UP WITH WHAT 

2058
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:31,660
EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR. 

2059
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:34,997
BUT I AM GUIDED BY THE SENATE, 

2060
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:38,534
I WANT TO MAKE THE SENATE HAPPY,

2061
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,668
THEY ARE ULTIMATELY MAKING THE 

2062
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:40,936
JUDGMENT, I HAVE ALREADY MADE 

2063
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:42,704
MY JUDGMENT, THE SENATE IS 

2064
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:43,905
MAKING A JUDGMENT ON JUDGE 

2065
01:15:43,905 --> 01:15:45,207
KAVANAUGH, THAT IS A VERY 

2066
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,808
IMPORTANT THING TO DO. 

2067
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:52,281
GO AHEAD PETER.

2068
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:58,420
>> JUST FOR CLARITY, SO IN FACT 

2069
01:15:58,420 --> 01:15:59,821
IT IS UP TO YOU TO INSTRUCT THE 

2070
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:00,789
FBI TO INSTRUCT THEM?>> IT IS 

2071
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:04,259
UP TO ME, BUT I'M INSTRUCTING 

2072
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,028
THEM AS PER WHAT I THINK THE 

2073
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,496
SENATE ONCE. 

2074
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:08,430
THE SENATE IS MAKING THE 

2075
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:09,564
DECISION, AND I'M INSTRUCTING 

2076
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:12,534
THEM AS TO WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING 

2077
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:12,734
FOR. 

2078
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:16,104
>> WILL YOU INSTRUCT THE WHITE 

2079
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:17,005
HOUSE COUNSEL DON McGANN TO 

2080
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:17,939
GIVE THE FBI FREE REIGN TO 

2081
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:19,574
INTERVIEW WHOEVER THEY FEEL IS 

2082
01:16:19,574 --> 01:16:20,042
NECESSARY QUICK 

2083
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:23,111
>> I HAVE SO INSTRUCTED HIM, I 

2084
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,379
DID IT OVER THE WEEKEND, I 

2085
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:27,282
DON'T WANT TO USE THE WORD 

2086
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:33,121
MISLEADING, IT IS A MUCH MORE 

2087
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:33,721
COMPLEX SUBJECT THAN MOST 

2088
01:16:33,721 --> 01:16:34,355
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND, ESSENTIALLY 

2089
01:16:34,355 --> 01:16:36,792
I HAVE DONE THAT, BUT I DID 

2090
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:37,759
ALSO SAY WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF 

2091
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,028
WHAT THE SENATE ONCE. 

2092
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:41,496
TO USE AN EXPRESSION OFTEN USED 

2093
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:44,132
BY ME, WE DON'T WANT TO GO ON A 

2094
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:46,068
WITCH HUNT, DO WE?>> JUST TO BE 

2095
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:49,938
CLEAR, SHOULD THE UNIT -- THE 

2096
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,240
FBI INTERVIEW ALL THREE OF 

2097
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:52,807
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S ACCUSERS? 

2098
01:16:52,807 --> 01:17:00,182
>> IT WOULDN'T BOTHER ME AT 

2099
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:01,316
ALL, I DON'T KNOW ALL THREE OF 

2100
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:01,983
THEM, CERTAINLY THEY ARE 

2101
01:17:01,983 --> 01:17:02,851
INTERVIEWING 2, THE THIRD I 

2102
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:03,785
DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT, IT 

2103
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:04,819
WOULDN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL, I 

2104
01:17:04,819 --> 01:17:06,455
HAVE HEARD THAT THE THIRD ONE 

2105
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:09,791
HAS, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS 

2106
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,359
TRUE, I HAVE NO IDEA, VERY 

2107
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:14,029
LITTLE CREDIBILITY, IF THERE IS 

2108
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:14,596
CREDIBILITY, INTERVIEW THE 

2109
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:18,066
THIRD ONE, BUT I WANTED TO BE 

2110
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:20,202
DONE QUICKLY, BECAUSE IT IS 

2111
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:21,736
UNFAIR TO THE FAMILY INTO THE 

2112
01:17:21,736 --> 01:17:24,506
JUDGE, IT IS SO UNFAIR TO HIS 

2113
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:27,876
KIDS AND HIS WIFE, AS WELL.

2114
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:31,780
>> HOW ABOUT FOR THE ACCUSERS, 

2115
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:32,748
HAS THE PROCESS BEEN FAIR TO 

2116
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:32,948
THEM? 

2117
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:37,753
>> CERTAINLY WE GAVE THE DOCTOR 

2118
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:39,988
TREMENDOUS TIME, WHICH IS GREAT,

2119
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:44,126
SHE SPOKE WELL, BUT THERE ARE 

2120
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,560
SOME QUESTIONS THAT HAVE NOT 

2121
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,429
BEEN ANSWERED, LIKE WHAT YEAR 

2122
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:48,630
WAS IT, WHAT DAY, WHERE, THE 

2123
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:52,200
LOCATION, THE HOUSE, A LOT OF 

2124
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:52,868
DIFFERENT THINGS, PEOPLE ARE 

2125
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:56,438
SAYING WHAT'S GOING ON? 

2126
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:57,773
WITH ALL OF THAT, YOU CANNOT 

2127
01:17:57,773 --> 01:17:59,007
SAY THAT WE'VE DONE ANYTHING 

2128
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:01,443
BUT BE RESPECTFUL. 

2129
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:03,111
AND I DO, I RESPECT HER 

2130
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:04,613
POSITION VERY MUCH, I RESPECT 

2131
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:07,482
YOUR POSITION VERY MUCH, I 

2132
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:09,885
BELIEVE -- AND AGAIN, 

2133
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:11,052
REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN THE 

2134
01:18:11,052 --> 01:18:14,088
SENATE, I BELIEVE THEY HAVE 

2135
01:18:14,088 --> 01:18:15,356
BEEN VERY RESPECTFUL TO THE 

2136
01:18:15,356 --> 01:18:22,697
DOCTOR, DR. FORD. 

2137
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:24,299
>> ISN'T THAT WHY THEY SHOULD 

2138
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:27,769
INTERVIEW ANYBODY TO CLEAR HIS 

2139
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:27,969
NAME? 

2140
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:29,137
>> ANYBODY THEY WANT, WITHIN 

2141
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:31,306
REASON, THEY SHOULD INTERVIEW, 

2142
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:36,078
BUT BE GUIDED, AND I AM GUIDED 

2143
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:36,912
BY WHAT THE SENATORS ARE 

2144
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:38,480
LOOKING FOR, THEY HAVE TO MAKE 

2145
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,549
THE CHOICE. 

2146
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,250
>> SHOULD BRETT KAVANAUGH BE 

2147
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:42,850
INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI QUICK 

2148
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:44,619
>> I THINK SO, I THINK IT'S 

2149
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:45,721
FINE IF THEY DO, I DON'T KNOW, 

2150
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:49,191
IT'S UP TO THEM, I THINK HE 

2151
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:50,358
SPOKE VERY CONCLUSIVELY AND 

2152
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:52,527
VERY WELL, IT HAS BEEN A VERY 

2153
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:55,664
ROUGH PERIOD OF TIME, I 

2154
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:58,266
GUARANTEE HE HASN'T HAD A 

2155
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:01,269
PERIOD LIKE THIS, WHEN HE WAS 

2156
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:02,070
NOMINATED, PEOPLE THOUGHT IT 

2157
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:06,842
WOULD BE QUICK. 

2158
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:07,843
10 YEARS AGO, PEOPLE THOUGHT HE 

2159
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:08,677
WOULD BE A SUPREME COURT 

2160
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:11,813
JUSTICE, HIS INTELLECT, CAREER, 

2161
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:12,881
THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NO 

2162
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:14,416
GAMES, THEY TALK ABOUT ALCOHOL, 

2163
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,383
ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU 

2164
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:16,985
HEAR, AND FRANKLY, YOU TAKE A 

2165
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:21,056
LOOK AT -- WE WOULD NOT KNOW 

2166
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:24,459
ABOUT THIS OVER THE LAST 20 

2167
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:27,262
YEARS, OVER THE LAST PARTS OF 

2168
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:28,630
HIS CAREER, WE WOULD KNOW ABOUT 

2169
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:32,234
IT, HIGH SCHOOL, THEY SAID HE 

2170
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:33,869
DRINK A LOT ONE EVENING AND 

2171
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:36,404
HIGH SCHOOL. 

2172
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:37,505
I TELL YOU WHAT, I HAPPEN TO 

2173
01:19:37,505 --> 01:19:38,240
KNOW SOME UNITED STATES 

2174
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,841
SENATORS, ONE WHO IS ON THE 

2175
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:43,010
OTHER SIDE, WHO IS PRETTY 

2176
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:44,212
AGGRESSIVE, I HAVE SEEN THAT 

2177
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:47,182
PERSON IN VERY BAD SITUATIONS, 

2178
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:47,582
OKAY? 

2179
01:19:47,582 --> 01:19:50,518
I'VE SEEN THAT PERSON IN VERY 

2180
01:19:50,518 --> 01:19:55,157
BAD SITUATIONS, SOMEWHAT 

2181
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:56,057
COMPROMISING, AND YOU KNOW, I 

2182
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:57,893
THINK IT IS VERY UNFAIR TO 

2183
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:00,428
BRING UP THINGS LIKE THIS. 

2184
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:01,829
HOWEVER, WHATEVER THE SENATORS 

2185
01:20:01,829 --> 01:20:06,668
WANT, IS OKAY WITH ME. 

2186
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:07,835
THEY ARE GOING TO BE MAKING A 

2187
01:20:07,835 --> 01:20:09,304
DECISION, WHATEVER THEY WANT IS 

2188
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:09,504
OKAY. 

2189
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:12,507
GO AHEAD.

2190
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:18,980
>> YOU SAID I HAVE BEEN DEALING 

2191
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:19,848
WITH THIS CRAP FOR YEARS, WHAT 

2192
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:24,019
DID YOU MEAN?>> I THINK THE 

2193
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:24,719
PRESS HAS TREATED ME 

2194
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,989
UNBELIEVABLY FAIRLY, WHEN I WON,

2195
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,190
THE PRESS FINALLY GETS IT I 

2196
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:29,891
THOUGHT, THEY WILL FINALLY 

2197
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:30,692
TREAT ME FAIRLY, THEY GOT 

2198
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:30,925
WORSE. 

2199
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:33,161
THEY ARE WORSE NOW THAN EVER. 

2200
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:38,299
THEY ARE LOCO, BUT THAT'S OKAY, 

2201
01:20:38,299 --> 01:20:41,402
I USE THAT WORD, BECAUSE OF THE 

2202
01:20:41,402 --> 01:20:43,071
FACT THAT WE MADE A DEAL WITH 

2203
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:43,939
MEXICO. 

2204
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:44,406
PLEASE, SIT DOWN. 

2205
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:53,081
YOU ARE GOING TO BE NEXT.

2206
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:54,249
>> I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT 

2207
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:54,816
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THERE ARE 

2208
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:55,851
CONCERNS THAT HE MAY HAVE LIED 

2209
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:56,351
OR MISCHARACTERIZED HIS 

2210
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,652
DRINKING WHILE TESTIFYING, IF 

2211
01:20:57,652 --> 01:20:59,788
THEY FIND THAT HE DID, DOES 

2212
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,090
THAT BAR HIM FROM BEING YOUR 

2213
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:03,458
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE? 

2214
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:05,559
>> I WATCHED HIM, I WAS 

2215
01:21:05,559 --> 01:21:09,030
SURPRISED AT HOW VOCAL HE WAS 

2216
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:12,434
ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE LIKES 

2217
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:15,403
BEER, AND HE'S HAD A LITTLE BIT 

2218
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:16,404
OF DIFFICULTY, I MEAN HE TALKED 

2219
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:17,272
ABOUT THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHEN 

2220
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:18,440
HE DRINK, THIS IS NOT A MAN 

2221
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,443
THAT SAID THAT ALCOHOL -- THAT 

2222
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:24,412
HE WAS PERFECT WITH RESPECT TO 

2223
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:26,214
ALCOHOL, ACTUALLY, GOING BACK 

2224
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:29,283
SO MANY YEARS, I THOUGHT HE WAS 

2225
01:21:29,283 --> 01:21:34,122
EXCELLENT. 

2226
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:34,722
THE INTERESTING THING IS, 

2227
01:21:34,722 --> 01:21:35,723
NOBODY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE LAST 

2228
01:21:35,723 --> 01:21:36,758
25 OR 30 YEARS DURING HIS 

2229
01:21:36,758 --> 01:21:38,126
PROFESSIONAL CAREER, THERE WERE 

2230
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:40,595
NO BAD REPORTS, THERE ARE BAD 

2231
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:42,264
REPORTS ON EVERYBODY IN HERE. 

2232
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:45,800
MOST OF THE PEOPLE SITTING DOWN,

2233
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,768
EXCEPT FOR VICE PRESIDENT MIKE 

2234
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:50,939
PENCE, BY THE WAY.

2235
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:51,505
>> [ LAUGHTER ] 

2236
01:21:51,505 --> 01:21:52,908
>> IF WE FIND ONE ON HIM, THAT 

2237
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:53,842
WILL BE THE GREATEST SHOCK OF 

2238
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:54,209
ALL TIME. 

2239
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:55,443
THERE ARE BAD REPORTS ON 

2240
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:56,577
EVERYBODY, I'M LOOKING AT 

2241
01:21:56,577 --> 01:22:00,615
PEOPLE, LOOK AT SOME OF THESE 

2242
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:01,883
PEOPLE ASKING THE QUESTIONS, 

2243
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:04,286
OKAY? 

2244
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:05,720
LOOK AT BLUMENTHAL, HE LIED 

2245
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,657
ABOUT VIETNAM, HE SAID FOR 15 

2246
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:11,860
YEARS HE WAS A WAR HERO, HE 

2247
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:16,798
FOUGHT IN DA NANG PROVINCE, HE 

2248
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:20,535
NEVER WENT TO VIETNAM. 

2249
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:21,703
HE IS UP THERE SAYING, WE NEED 

2250
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:24,906
HONESTY AND WE NEED INTEGRITY. 

2251
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:26,007
THIS GUY LIED WHEN HE WAS THE 

2252
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:26,474
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF 

2253
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:28,510
CONNECTICUT. 

2254
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,679
HE LIED. 

2255
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:32,713
I DON'T MEAN A LITTLE BIT. 

2256
01:22:32,713 --> 01:22:34,015
AND THEN WHEN HE GOT OUT, HE 

2257
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,550
DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE AND HE 

2258
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:36,317
WON ANYWAY, BECAUSE DEMOCRATS 

2259
01:22:36,317 --> 01:22:37,218
ALWAYS WIN IN CONNECTICUT, VERY 

2260
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,386
CLOSE, THE CLOSEST EVER, HE 

2261
01:22:39,386 --> 01:22:42,757
LIED, HE'S UP THERE TALKING 

2262
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:44,426
LIKE HE'S HOLIER THAN THOU. 

2263
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:46,194
YOU KNOW WHAT, TAKE A LOOK AT 

2264
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:50,865
HIS RECORD, WHEN HE GOT OUT, 

2265
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:51,700
WHEN HE APOLOGIZED, HE WAS 

2266
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:52,733
CRYING, THE TEARS WERE ALL OVER 

2267
01:22:52,733 --> 01:22:54,536
THE PLACE, AND NOW HE ACTS LIKE 

2268
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:55,737
HOW DARE YOU. 

2269
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:57,672
TAKE A LOOK AT THE JUDGE WHO 

2270
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:01,109
HAS LED AN EXEMPLARY LIFE, 

2271
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:03,378
GOING BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL, 

2272
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:05,280
BECAUSE HE HAD BEER? 

2273
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:11,152
I THINK THE JUDGE HAS BEEN 

2274
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,053
PRETTY AMAZING ABOUT DESCRIBING 

2275
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:13,120
HIS SITUATION WITH ALCOHOL AND 

2276
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,222
BEER. 

2277
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:16,390
TAKE A LOOK AT CORY BOOKER, HE 

2278
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:20,562
RAN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY INTO THE 

2279
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:22,931
GROUND, A HORRIBLE MAYOR, AND 

2280
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:24,265
HE MADE STATEMENTS, WHEN HE WAS 

2281
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:25,366
IN HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE, WHAT 

2282
01:23:25,366 --> 01:23:27,135
HE WAS DOING, HE MADE THE 

2283
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:28,102
STATEMENTS, NOW HE'S TALKING 

2284
01:23:28,102 --> 01:23:30,705
ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH, AND I 

2285
01:23:30,705 --> 01:23:32,073
COULD GO THROUGH A WHOLE LIST 

2286
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:32,373
OF THEM. 

2287
01:23:32,373 --> 01:23:34,109
LOOK AT DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 

2288
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:37,412
TELLING ME ABOUT TIME, DIANNE 

2289
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:39,180
FEINSTEIN KNEW ABOUT THIS TWO 

2290
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:42,450
MONTHS EARLIER, IF SHE WANTED A 

2291
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:43,083
REALLY THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, 

2292
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:44,586
WE HAD ALL THE TIME IN THE 

2293
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:46,421
WORLD. 

2294
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:47,422
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL 

2295
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:48,756
AFTER THE HEARING WAS CLOSED, 

2296
01:23:48,756 --> 01:23:51,726
ESSENTIALLY, SHE SHOULD OF SAID 

2297
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:53,962
LISTEN, I HAVE A PROBLEM. 

2298
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:57,866
I HAVE THIS REPORT. 

2299
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,100
I WOULD LIKE THE FBI TO LOOK AT 

2300
01:23:59,100 --> 01:23:59,968
IT WHILE REDOING THE HEARINGS, 

2301
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:03,538
WE HAD TWO MONTHS. 

2302
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:04,506
NO, SHE DIDN'T DO THAT, SHE 

2303
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:06,074
WAITED UNTIL WE WERE CLOSED, 

2304
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:08,410
AND THEN SHE PROBABLY LEAKED IT,

2305
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:19,387
BUT YOU KNOW, WHO AM I TO SAY? 

2306
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:20,188
BUT SHE PROBABLY LEAKED IT, 

2307
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:21,389
BASED ON HER VERY BAD BODY 

2308
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:21,989
LANGUAGE YESTERDAY, BUT MORE 

2309
01:24:21,989 --> 01:24:22,990
IMPORTANTLY IN A SENSE, FOR HER 

2310
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:24,059
TO HAVE WAITED THAT PERIOD OF 

2311
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:24,859
TIME, AND AFTER YOU DEMOCRATS, 

2312
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:26,394
AND I'M INCLUDING YOU, TOO, I 

2313
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:27,395
CONSIDER YOU PART OF THE 

2314
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:28,562
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, FOR THE 

2315
01:24:28,562 --> 01:24:35,537
DEMOCRATS, TO BE TALKING ABOUT 

2316
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:36,738
WE ONE MORE TIME FOR THE FBI, 

2317
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:37,839
IF YOU WANTED MORE TIME FOR THE 

2318
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:41,042
FBI, WHY DIDN'T DIANNE FEINSTEIN

2319
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:41,643
BRING THIS UP? 

2320
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:42,844
YOU KNOW THAT SHE SHOWED THIS 

2321
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:43,611
TO OTHER DEMOCRATS, SHE'S NOT 

2322
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:44,078
THE ONLY ONE. 

2323
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:45,413
SHE SHOWED THIS TO OTHER 

2324
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:50,685
DEMOCRATS. 

2325
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:51,686
THERE WERE MORE THAN JUST HER 

2326
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:52,487
THAT KNEW ABOUT THIS BIG 

2327
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:53,254
CONFIDENTIAL THING, IT WAS 

2328
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,055
CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL THE HEARING 

2329
01:24:54,055 --> 01:24:54,889
WAS OVER, AFTER IT WAS OVER, 

2330
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:58,393
THEY WENT PUBLIC. 

2331
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,627
WHY DID THEY DO IT DURING THE 

2332
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:00,395
HEARING, WE COULD'VE HAD ALL 

2333
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:01,596
THE TIME IN THE WORLD, YOU KNOW 

2334
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:01,796
WHY? 

2335
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,898
THEY ARE DISHONEST PEOPLE.>> 

2336
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:05,300
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION, 

2337
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,668
MR. PRESIDENT. 

2338
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:08,403
SO IF HE DID LIE ABOUT HIS 

2339
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:12,107
DRINKING, DOES THAT MEAN YOU 

2340
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:12,774
WILL PULL HIS NOMINATION? 

2341
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:13,842
>> I DON'T THINK HE DID, I'M 

2342
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:17,212
JUST SAYING, I'M NOT A DRINKER, 

2343
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:18,146
I CAN HONESTLY SAY I'VE NEVER 

2344
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:19,747
HAD A BEER IN MY LIFE. 

2345
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:21,014
ONE OF MY ONLY GOOD TRAITS. 

2346
01:25:21,014 --> 01:25:25,820
I DON'T DRINK. 

2347
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:26,754
WHENEVER THEY ARE LOOKING FOR 

2348
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:27,789
SOMETHING GOOD, I NEVER HAD A 

2349
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,156
GLASS OF ALCOHOL, FOR WHATEVER 

2350
01:25:29,156 --> 01:25:29,524
REASON. 

2351
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:33,127
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I HAD, WHAT 

2352
01:25:33,127 --> 01:25:33,795
A MESS I BE? 

2353
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:34,629
I'D BE THE WORLD'S WORST. 

2354
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:37,532
I NEVER DRINK. 

2355
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:39,267
I CAN TELL YOU, I WATCHED THAT 

2356
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:41,569
HEARING, AND I WATCHED A MAN 

2357
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:42,370
SAYING THAT HE DID HAVE 

2358
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:45,473
DIFFICULTY AS A YOUNG MAN WITH 

2359
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:46,674
DRINK, THE ONE QUESTION I DID 

2360
01:25:46,674 --> 01:25:48,309
NOT ASK, HOW ABOUT THE LAST 20 

2361
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:51,913
YEARS, HAVE YOU HAD DIFFICULTY 

2362
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:55,283
IN THE LAST 20 YEARS, NOBODY 

2363
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:56,450
SAID BUT -- ANYTHING BAD ABOUT 

2364
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:57,652
HIM, THEY GO BACK TO HIGH 

2365
01:25:57,652 --> 01:25:58,986
SCHOOL, I GRADUATED FROM HIGH 

2366
01:25:58,986 --> 01:26:02,123
SCHOOL, WHILE I DID NOT DRINK, 

2367
01:26:02,123 --> 01:26:04,225
I SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE DRINKING, 

2368
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:05,660
THEY WOULD DRINK BEER, GO 

2369
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:08,129
CRAZY, HIGH SCHOOL, 16, 17 

2370
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:12,433
YEARS OLD, AND I SAW A LOT OF 

2371
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:14,035
IT. 

2372
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:15,069
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY CAN'T 

2373
01:26:15,069 --> 01:26:16,070
DO SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT TO 

2374
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:16,871
DO WITH YOUR LIFE? 

2375
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:17,538
IT IS A TOUGH THING. 

2376
01:26:17,538 --> 01:26:18,606
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT HE WAS 

2377
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:20,074
VERY STRONG ON THE FACT THAT HE 

2378
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:22,610
DRINK A LOT, SO I DON'T KNOW IF 

2379
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,045
THERE IS A BIG DISCREPANCY. 

2380
01:26:24,045 --> 01:26:24,946
GO AHEAD, PLEASE.

2381
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:28,449
>> CAN YOU PROMISE THAT -- 

2382
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:32,086
>> YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH, GO AHEAD, 

2383
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:33,121
PLEASE.

2384
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:35,623
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, 

2385
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:37,825
JUDGE TARTT -- JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

2386
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:43,464
SAID HE WAS TARGETED BY 

2387
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:44,599
DEMOCRATS, HAS HE MADE THIS 

2388
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:45,400
POLITICAL? 

2389
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,635
HOW CAN YOU GUARANTEE THAT HE 

2390
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:50,605
WILL HAVE IMPARTIAL DECISIONS? 

2391
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:52,340
>> HE IS A GOOD MAN WITH A 

2392
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,741
GREAT FAMILY, HE HAS BEEN 

2393
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:56,311
TREATED HORRIBLY. 

2394
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:57,111
LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS, I THOUGHT 

2395
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:58,046
TERRIFIC, THE OTHER DAY, HE 

2396
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:01,783
BROUGHT UP ONE POINT THAT IS 

2397
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:03,051
NOW BEING DISCUSSED BY A LOT OF 

2398
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:06,487
PEOPLE, AND THAT IS, WHO IS 

2399
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:07,522
GOING TO WANT TO RUN FOR 

2400
01:27:07,522 --> 01:27:08,890
OFFICE, BE IN OFFICE, TAKEN 

2401
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,091
APPOINTMENT, NOT JUST SUPREME 

2402
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:14,996
COURT, BUT MANY POSITIONS. 

2403
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:17,565
I HAVE 360 PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT 

2404
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:18,833
BEING APPROVED, VERY QUALIFIED, 

2405
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,502
NO ONE SAYING THEY'RE NOT 

2406
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:23,638
QUALIFIED, BUT SENATOR SCHUMER 

2407
01:27:23,638 --> 01:27:28,409
IS NOT PASSING THEM BECAUSE OF 

2408
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:31,879
OBSTRUCTION. 

2409
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:32,947
IT IS FAR MORE PEOPLE THAN 

2410
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:34,415
ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 

2411
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:37,952
COUNTRY, MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE 

2412
01:27:37,952 --> 01:27:38,552
ARE ROUTINE APPROVALS, THEY 

2413
01:27:38,552 --> 01:27:39,587
GAVE UP JOBS, THEY GAVE UP 

2414
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,222
THEIR LIFE TO COME AND SERVE 

2415
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:42,523
OUR COUNTRY, AND CHUCK SCHUMER 

2416
01:27:42,523 --> 01:27:44,425
AND HIS GROUP WON'T APPROVE 

2417
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:45,826
THEM, THEY ARE SLOW WALKING 

2418
01:27:45,826 --> 01:27:50,798
THEM, A 30 HOURS MEETING, A 

2419
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:51,733
PERSON THAT'S GOING TO BE 

2420
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:55,003
APPROVED, IT'S A DISGRACE. 

2421
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:57,505
SO WHEN THE JUDGE BRINGS UP -- 

2422
01:27:57,505 --> 01:28:00,875
WHETHER IT IS POLITICS OR NOT, 

2423
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,076
I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE HAS BEEN 

2424
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:04,312
TREATED REALLY HORRIBLY.

2425
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:06,113
>> BUT ARE YOU CONCERNED? 

2426
01:28:06,113 --> 01:28:12,153
>> NO CUP YOU KNOW WHAT I'M 

2427
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:13,121
CONCERNED ABOUT, THAT WE GET 

2428
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:13,854
GREAT PEOPLE ON THE U.S. 

2429
01:28:13,854 --> 01:28:14,889
SUPREME COURT, I WANT TO HAVE 

2430
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:16,090
GREAT PEOPLE, AND I WILL -- I 

2431
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,125
DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO CALL 

2432
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,328
PEOPLE FOR ANY COURT AND HAVE 

2433
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:21,195
THEM SAY IT'S A GREAT HONOR, 

2434
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:22,463
BUT NO THANK YOU, I CAN'T DO 

2435
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:22,629
IT. 

2436
01:28:22,629 --> 01:28:24,231
THAT WOULD BE A SAD DAY FOR 

2437
01:28:24,231 --> 01:28:29,304
COUNTRY. 

2438
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:30,438
AND WE ARE GOING TO COME CLOSE 

2439
01:28:30,438 --> 01:28:31,806
TO THAT, I KNOW PEOPLE NOW, I 

2440
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,408
DON'T KNOW HOW HE DOES A, 

2441
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:35,310
NOBODY KNEW A THING LIKE THIS 

2442
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,411
COULD'VE HAPPENED. 

2443
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:42,917
WHEN JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH SHOULD

2444
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:48,923
-- GOT APPROVED, SHE DIDN'T 

2445
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:53,161
HAVE THIS, YOU KNOW THAT MANY 

2446
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:53,694
STORIES WERE PULLED BACK, 

2447
01:28:53,694 --> 01:28:58,399
CERTAIN STORIES WERE PULLED 

2448
01:28:58,399 --> 01:28:59,267
BACK THAT WERE HORRIBLE, WHAT 

2449
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:00,368
THEY'RE DOING TO THIS MAN AND 

2450
01:29:00,368 --> 01:29:01,602
HIS FAMILY IS SAD AND BAD FOR A 

2451
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:01,835
NATION. 

2452
01:29:01,835 --> 01:29:02,670
>> YOU SAID SOME SENATORS ARE 

2453
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,339
NOT ANGELS, AND USE ALL MANY OF 

2454
01:29:05,339 --> 01:29:08,343
THEM IN COMPROMISING SITUATIONS,

2455
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,111
CAN YOU TELL US WHO EXACTLY 

2456
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:11,012
WHAT SITUATIONS? 

2457
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:12,847
>> I THINK I WILL SAVE IT FOR A 

2458
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:14,649
BOOK LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, AND I 

2459
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:15,950
WILL WRITE IT, I'M NOT GIVING 

2460
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:23,157
IT TO YOU.

2461
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:24,292
>> IF THE FBI FINDS OTHER 

2462
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:24,925
WITNESSES WHO CAN CORROBORATE 

2463
01:29:24,925 --> 01:29:25,727
THE ACCOUNTS OF ANY ACCUSERS, 

2464
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:26,327
WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH? 

2465
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:27,228
>> I WOULD CERTAINLY LOOK AT 

2466
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:30,365
THAT, I AM OPEN. 

2467
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:31,699
I THINK HE IS A FINE MAN, I 

2468
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:33,801
THINK HE IS A GREAT SCHOLAR, I 

2469
01:29:33,801 --> 01:29:34,802
STILL BELIEVED HIM, WHEN HE 

2470
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:36,471
SAID WHAT HE DID, HE FOCUSED ON 

2471
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:38,206
BEING NUMBER 1 AT YALE, NUMBER 

2472
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:42,710
1 HIGH SCHOOL, AT LAW, HE 

2473
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,111
FOCUSED, I CAN SO UNDERSTAND 

2474
01:29:44,111 --> 01:29:47,048
THAT. 

2475
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:51,652
THE WAY HE SAID THAT, IT MADE 

2476
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:53,020
AN IMPACT ON ME, SO FOCUSED ON 

2477
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,756
BEING NUMBER 1 AT YALE, AND I 

2478
01:29:55,756 --> 01:29:57,358
BELIEVE HE WAS NUMBER 1 AT YALE,

2479
01:29:57,358 --> 01:30:01,829
UNDERSTOOD THAT VERY WELL.

2480
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:02,863
>> I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT 

2481
01:30:02,863 --> 01:30:03,698
SOMETHING ELSE YOU BROUGHT UP 

2482
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:05,133
TODAY, THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTING, 

2483
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:05,800
THERE'S SOME FRUSTRATION THAT 

2484
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,136
MORE HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT BUMP 

2485
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:09,670
STOCKS.

2486
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:12,373
>> YOU ARE WRONG ABOUT THAT, IN 

2487
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:16,076
ORDER TO ELIMINATE, TERMINATE, 

2488
01:30:16,076 --> 01:30:17,078
BUMP STOCKS, WE HAVE TO GO 

2489
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:19,313
THROUGH A PROCEDURE, WE ARE AT 

2490
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:20,415
THE FINAL STAGES OF THE 

2491
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,215
PROCEDURE, IN FACT THE LAWYERS 

2492
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:23,751
WERE JUST TELLING ME, OVER THE 

2493
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:25,052
NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS, I WILL BE 

2494
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:28,055
ABLE TO WRITE IT UP, RULES AND 

2495
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:29,523
REGULATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE 

2496
01:30:29,523 --> 01:30:30,191
REALLY TOUGH, EVEN FOR 

2497
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:34,829
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WE ARE 

2498
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:35,630
KNOCKING OUT BUMP STOCKS, I'VE 

2499
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:38,800
TOLD THE NRA, THEY ARE GONE. 

2500
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,334
BUT TO DO IT, YOU HAVE TO GO TO

01:30:58,852 --> 01:31:01,555
THAT TAKES ABOUT A YEAR TO DO 

2509
01:31:01,555 --> 01:31:02,957
IT.

2510
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:06,127

THE QUESTION, THE BUMP STOCK IS 

2519
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:24,312

2534
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:56,811
QUESTION, SINCE STEALING

01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:57,878
ALUMINUM SERVES WON'T BE COMING 

2536
01:31:57,878 --> 01:31:58,478
DOWN FROM CANADA AND MEXICO, 

2537
01:31:58,478 --> 01:32:01,816
CAN YOU DISCUSS WHETHER THERE 

2538
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:03,184
ARE MEASURES TO STOP THE 

2539
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:05,253
RETALIATORY MEASURES?

2540
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:09,190
>> THEY ARE NOT RETALIATORY, 

2541
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,258
BUT THEY WERE DUMPING IN OUR 

2542
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:11,892
COUNTRY, CHINA AND VARIOUS 

2543
01:32:11,892 --> 01:32:12,760
OTHERS, DUMPING VARIOUS AMOUNTS 

2544
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:16,864
OF DEBT STEAL, IT'S CALLED DEBT 

2545
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:19,567
STEAL, AND ALSO IMPERFECT STEAL 

2546
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:25,673
-- STEEL. INSIDE WAS A LOT OF 

2547
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:29,443
WEAKER THINGS, WHEN YOU HAVE 

2548
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:32,046
QUANTITIES OF OTHER MATERIAL IN 

2549
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:37,585
THE STEAL, -- STEEL, SO IT IS 

2550
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:41,455
NOT JUST ECONOMIC. 

2551
01:32:41,455 --> 01:32:42,390
THE MINERS HAVE BEEN THANKFUL, 

2552
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:44,125

2555
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:59,907
METALLURGIC COAL, THIS IS NOT 

2556
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:00,675
JUST FOR HEATING ELECTRIC, THIS 

2557
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:02,443
IS USED TO MAKE STEEL, WE ARE 

2558
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:06,146
MAKING STEEL, AND THE PRICE 

2559
01:33:06,146 --> 01:33:06,948
WILL END UP BEING LESS, WE 

2560
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:08,215
DON'T HAVE THE SHIPPING 

2561
01:33:08,215 --> 01:33:09,717
PROBLEMS, WHEN YOU SHIP IT FROM 

2562
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:12,553
PLACES SO FAR AWAY, YOU WILL 

2563
01:33:12,553 --> 01:33:14,555

NEW PLANTS OPENING UP IN OUR 

2565
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:16,156

2566
01:33:16,156 --> 01:33:17,658
OTHER, OUTSIDERS WILL BE ABLE 

2567
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:18,993
TO COMPETE. 

2568
01:33:18,993 --> 01:33:19,960
JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS 

2569
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,395

2570
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:23,464
GOING TO KNOCK OUT EVERY STEEL 

2571
01:33:23,464 --> 01:33:26,534
PLAN. 

2572
01:33:26,534 --> 01:33:27,668
THEY WERE GOING TO DOUBLE AND 

2573
01:33:27,668 --> 01:33:28,269
TRIPLE PRICE, A DANGEROUS 

2574
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:29,703
THING, WE'VE EMPLOYED A LOT OF 

2575
01:33:29,703 --> 01:33:32,707
PEOPLE, AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 

2576
01:33:32,707 --> 01:33:33,940
IS NOW FLOWING INTO OUR 

2577
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:37,178

FUTURE TARIFFS, IT COULD 

2585
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:52,393
POTENTIALLY STIFLE A ECONOMY 

2586
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:54,462
THAT IS HOT, A STOCK MARKET 

2587
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:59,767
THAT IS HOT, BUT ONCE AGAIN, AS 

2588
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:00,434
IT RELATES TO CHINA, MORE 

2589
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:01,435
TARIFFS CAN COME DOWN THE LINE. 

2590
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:03,971

01:34:12,379 --> 01:34:14,849
MAKE A FAIR AND RECIPROCAL DEAL,

2596
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:16,350
WE HAVE A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO

WHEN THEY DRAIN IS FOR $500 

2599
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:22,423
BILLION A YEAR, WHICH IS 

2600
01:34:22,423 --> 01:34:26,660
PROBABLY THE REAL NUMBER, NOT 

2601
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:27,461
INCLUDING THE THEFT OF 

2602
01:34:27,461 --> 01:34:28,262
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER 

2603
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:29,863
THINGS, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY 

2604
01:34:29,863 --> 01:34:33,434
THAT THAT COULD BE $300 BILLION 

2605
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:36,403
A YEAR, YOU CAN'T LET THAT 

2606
01:34:36,403 --> 01:34:40,574

THAT. 

2614
01:34:51,919 --> 01:34:53,621
THE NICE PART ABOUT THE DEAL WE

ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH, THE 

2680
01:37:13,394 --> 01:37:14,094
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES PATH 

2681
01:37:14,094 --> 01:37:18,899
FORWARD, SHALL WE SAY, AS THE 

2682
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:19,767
FBI BEGINS AN INVESTIGATION 

2683
01:37:19,767 --> 01:37:20,868
INTO ALLEGATIONS THAT HE 

2684
01:37:20,868 --> 01:37:22,069
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED CHRISTINE 

2685
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:28,509
BLASEY FORD BACK IN THE 1980S.

2686
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:30,244
>>> PAULA REID IS JOINING US 

2687
01:37:30,244 --> 01:37:31,879
NOW, SHE WAS THERE DURING THIS 

2688
01:37:31,879 --> 01:37:32,479
PRESS CONFERENCE, A LOT OF 

2689
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:35,683
QUESTIONS ABOUT TRADE, THE 

2690
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:36,483
PRESIDENT WANTED TO STICK TO 

2691
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:39,119
THE TOPIC AT HAND, AND OF 

2692
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:39,586
COURSE THE QUESTIONS 

2693
01:37:39,586 --> 01:37:40,454
SURROUNDING BRETT KAVANAUGH, 

2694
01:37:40,454 --> 01:37:42,155
AND I FOUND A COUPLE OF THINGS 

2695
01:37:42,155 --> 01:37:43,924
STRIKING AND INTERESTING THAT I 

2696
01:37:43,924 --> 01:37:45,059
WROTE DOWN, IT STRUCK ME THAT 

2697
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:46,827
THE PRESIDENT SEEM TO INDICATE 

2698
01:37:46,827 --> 01:37:48,529
THAT HE WAS SURPRISED BY THE 

2699
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,597
AMOUNT OF DRINKING THAT BRETT 

2700
01:37:50,597 --> 01:37:55,035
KAVANAUGH DID, THE PRESIDENT 

2701
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:55,869
SAYING THAT HE HAS NEVER 

2702
01:37:55,869 --> 01:37:56,870
TOUCHED A DROP OF ALCOHOL IN 

2703
01:37:56,870 --> 01:37:58,339
HIS LIFE, AND HE SEEMED TO 

2704
01:37:58,339 --> 01:38:01,408
INDICATE THAT IT STRUCK HIM THAT

2705
01:38:01,408 --> 01:38:02,977
BRETT KAVANAUGH HAD SOME TYPE 

2706
01:38:02,977 --> 01:38:04,411
OF DRINKING PROBLEM, AND HE 

2707
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:06,847
SAID THAT THE FBI SHOULD 

2708
01:38:06,847 --> 01:38:09,783
INTERVIEW BRETT KAVANAUGH, BUT 

2709
01:38:09,783 --> 01:38:11,085
HE WOULD LEAVE IT UP TO THEM, I 

2710
01:38:11,085 --> 01:38:11,852
WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS? 

2711
01:38:11,852 --> 01:38:13,386
>> THE BIG QUESTION OF THE DAY 

2712
01:38:13,386 --> 01:38:17,357
IS, IS THE WHITE HOUSE PUTTING 

2713
01:38:17,357 --> 01:38:18,292
ANY LIMITATION ON THE FBI 

2714
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:19,493
CONDUCTING WAS ESSENTIALLY A 

2715
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:24,264
SUPPLEMENTARY BACKGROUND CHECK, 

2716
01:38:24,264 --> 01:38:25,165
AND THE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT 

2717
01:38:25,165 --> 01:38:26,033
DIRECTLY ANSWER THE QUESTION ON 

2718
01:38:26,033 --> 01:38:27,067
WHETHER THE WHITE HOUSE HAD PUT 

2719
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:28,302
SPECIFIC PARAMETERS, BUT HE 

2720
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:32,006
SAID PUBLICLY, IF THEY WANT TO 

2721
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:33,207
INTERVIEW ALL THREE ACCUSERS, 

2722
01:38:33,207 --> 01:38:36,076
NO PROBLEM, AND JUDGE 

2723
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:37,011
KAVANAUGH, HE WANTED TO BE DONE 

2724
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:37,277
QUICKLY. 

2725
01:38:37,277 --> 01:38:39,579
HE SAID THEY ARE BEING LIMITED 

2726
01:38:39,579 --> 01:38:45,085
BY THE WHITE HOUSE, THE 

2727
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:45,953
PRESIDENT IN THE ROSE GARDEN 

2728
01:38:45,953 --> 01:38:46,987
TODAY, SAYS THAT HE IS NOT 

2729
01:38:46,987 --> 01:38:47,654
PUTTING OUT RESTRICTIONS, HE 

2730
01:38:47,654 --> 01:38:49,022
WILL DO WHATEVER THE SENATE 

2731
01:38:49,022 --> 01:38:52,993
ONCE, ULTIMATELY THE QUESTION 

2732
01:38:52,993 --> 01:38:54,561
IS WHERE DOES THE FBI TAKE ITS 

2733
01:38:54,561 --> 01:38:55,362
MARCHING ORDERS, FROM THE 

2734
01:38:55,362 --> 01:38:57,398
PODIUM IN THE ROSE GARDEN, OR 

2735
01:38:57,398 --> 01:39:01,435
FROM DON McGANN, WHO HAS BEEN 

2736
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:02,302
INSTRUCTING THEM ON HOW FAR 

2737
01:39:02,302 --> 01:39:04,505
THEY CAN GO. 

2738
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:06,039
>> AN INTERESTING QUESTION. 

2739
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:07,674
I WANT TO BRING IN MAJOR 

2740
01:39:07,674 --> 01:39:08,809
GARRETT, JOINING ME I BELIEVE 

2741
01:39:08,809 --> 01:39:10,877
FROM THE ROSE GARDEN. 

2742
01:39:10,877 --> 01:39:12,312
AGAIN, I AM STRUCK BY THE 

2743
01:39:12,312 --> 01:39:14,782
PRESIDENT, WHO AS YOU KNOW AS 

2744
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,450
WELL AS MOST AMERICANS, DOESN'T 

2745
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:18,619
DRINK AT ALL, AND DOES NOT 

2746
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:20,154
GENERALLY LIKE PEOPLE WHO DRINK,

2747
01:39:20,154 --> 01:39:24,925
AND I'M QUOTING THE PRESIDENT, 

2748
01:39:24,925 --> 01:39:25,926
HE SAID I CAN HONESTLY SAY I 

2749
01:39:25,926 --> 01:39:27,227
HAVE NEVER HAD A BEER IN MY 

2750
01:39:27,227 --> 01:39:28,962
LIFE, BUT HE ALSO SAID THIS, I 

2751
01:39:28,962 --> 01:39:31,632
WAS SURPRISED ABOUT HOW VOCAL 

2752
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:32,299
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS ABOUT THE 

2753
01:39:32,299 --> 01:39:36,570
FACT THAT HE LIKES BEER, 

2754
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:37,504
QUOTING THE PRESIDENT, HE SAID 

2755
01:39:37,504 --> 01:39:38,472
HE HAD DIFFICULTY AS A YOUNG 

2756
01:39:38,472 --> 01:39:40,874
MAN WITH DRINKING. 

2757
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:41,608
BRETT KAVANAUGH SEEMED TO TRY 

2758
01:39:41,608 --> 01:39:44,878
TO CONVEY THE OPPOSITE WHEN HE 

2759
01:39:44,878 --> 01:39:45,913
WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF THE 

2760
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:46,580
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 

2761
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:46,780
QUAKE 

2762
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:48,082
>> WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 

2763
01:39:48,082 --> 01:39:49,917
TRYING TO DO WAS SAYING HE WAS 

2764
01:39:49,917 --> 01:39:50,717
VOCAL, MEANING HE WAS WILLING 

2765
01:39:50,717 --> 01:39:56,423
TO DISCUSS IT, THEREFORE HE DID 

2766
01:39:56,423 --> 01:39:57,324
NOT CONTRADICT HIMSELF OR SAY 

2767
01:39:57,324 --> 01:39:58,258
SOMETHING THAT UNDER OATH COULD 

2768
01:39:58,258 --> 01:39:59,126
LATER BE DISPROVEN, MEANING HE 

2769
01:39:59,126 --> 01:40:01,261
WAS LYING UNDER OATH, WHICH 

2770
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:02,229
WOULD BE, AND MOST WHITE 

2771
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:08,235
HOUSES, A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE TO 

2772
01:40:08,235 --> 01:40:09,169
CONSIDER FOR SOMEONE ON A 

2773
01:40:09,169 --> 01:40:10,303
LIFETIME POSITION ON THE COURT. 

2774
01:40:10,303 --> 01:40:11,872
AND THE PRESIDENT WENT ON A 

2775
01:40:11,872 --> 01:40:15,409
RAMBLING DISCUSSION ABOUT OTHER 

2776
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:16,276
PEOPLE THE SENATE, IN THE ROSE 

2777
01:40:16,276 --> 01:40:17,311
GARDEN, PROBLEMS OR ISSUES, OF 

2778
01:40:17,311 --> 01:40:20,447
COURSE NOT ONE OF THOSE 

2779
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:21,882
INDIVIDUALS NOMINATED TO HOLD A 

2780
01:40:21,882 --> 01:40:22,383
LIFETIME POSITION. 

2781
01:40:22,383 --> 01:40:25,386
THIS IS AN UNDERLYING QUESTION, 

2782
01:40:25,386 --> 01:40:27,721
IS THAT DISQUALIFYING? 

2783
01:40:27,721 --> 01:40:28,922
DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND 

2784
01:40:28,922 --> 01:40:35,229
NOMINATION OF NEIL GORSUCH AND 

2785
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:35,863
BRETT KAVANAUGH, THE PRESIDENT 

2786
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:37,397
SAID IT IS A SPECIAL PLACE, THE 

2787
01:40:37,397 --> 01:40:45,672
HIGHEST STANDARDS APPLY, WELL 

2788
01:40:45,672 --> 01:40:46,573
IF THE HIGHEST STANDARDS APPLY, 

2789
01:40:46,573 --> 01:40:47,608
AND THERE ARE THINGS YOU SAID 

2790
01:40:47,608 --> 01:40:48,375
UNDER SWORN TESTIMONY, AND 

2791
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:49,343
OTHER PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY WERE 

2792
01:40:49,343 --> 01:40:50,043
EYEWITNESSES OF YOUR BEHAVIOR, 

2793
01:40:50,043 --> 01:40:50,744
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE EXCESSIVE 

2794
01:40:50,744 --> 01:40:52,045
DRINKING, SAY YOU ARE LYING 

2795
01:40:52,045 --> 01:40:54,314
ABOUT, THOSE THINGS ARE NOT 

2796
01:40:54,314 --> 01:40:56,116
TRUE, IS THAT BY ITSELF 

2797
01:40:56,116 --> 01:40:56,550
DISQUALIFYING? 

2798
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:57,551
THE PRESIDENT NEVER GOT AROUND 

2799
01:40:57,551 --> 01:40:58,685
TO THAT ANSWER AT ALL. 

2800
01:40:58,685 --> 01:41:01,588
AND THIS CREATES A POSSIBLE 

2801
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:02,823
UNCOMFORTABLE NEXUS FOR THE 

2802
01:41:02,823 --> 01:41:05,125
WHITE HOUSE, BECAUSE IF THE 

2803
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:07,294
PRESIDENT SAYS, WILL YES, HE 

2804
01:41:07,294 --> 01:41:08,762
SEEMED TO HAVE SOME ISSUE WITH 

2805
01:41:08,762 --> 01:41:15,135
ALCOHOL, AND THERE ARE THOSE 

2806
01:41:15,135 --> 01:41:16,003
WITNESSES WHO SAY THAT HE COULD 

2807
01:41:16,003 --> 01:41:16,670
BECOME AGGRESSIVE AND SOMETIMES 

2808
01:41:16,670 --> 01:41:17,504
DISORIENTED FROM DRINKING TOO 

2809
01:41:17,504 --> 01:41:18,538
MUCH ALCOHOL, DOES THAT 

2810
01:41:18,538 --> 01:41:19,907
UNDERMINE HIS BLANKET DENIAL OF 

2811
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:22,209
ANY OF THESE ACCUSATIONS, OF 

2812
01:41:22,209 --> 01:41:24,878
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT A RESULT? 

2813
01:41:24,878 --> 01:41:27,714
THIS IS VERY TOUCHY TERRAIN, 

2814
01:41:27,714 --> 01:41:29,283
BOTH AS A MATTER OF LAW, 

2815
01:41:29,283 --> 01:41:31,919
PROCESS, AND POSSIBLY AS A 

2816
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:32,986
MATTER OF POLITICS. 

2817
01:41:32,986 --> 01:41:36,857
THAT I WOULD SAY THIS, THE TWO 

2818
01:41:36,857 --> 01:41:37,824
MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGES FROM 

2819
01:41:37,824 --> 01:41:40,460
THE WHITE HOUSE AND PRESIDENT 

2820
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:42,729
TRUMP, QUICKLY, AND KAVANAUGH 

2821
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:47,101
HAS BEEN TREATED VICIOUSLY. 

2822
01:41:47,101 --> 01:41:48,101
HE WANTS THE FBI TO MOVE AS 

2823
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:54,107
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, THOSE 

2824
01:41:54,107 --> 01:41:54,807
THINGS STILL INDICATE THAT THIS 

2825
01:41:54,807 --> 01:41:55,542
WHITE HOUSE EXPECTS AND 

2826
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:59,980
BELIEVES AN FBI REPORT IN THE 

2827
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:00,914
NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE, AND THE 

2828
01:42:00,914 --> 01:42:01,748
REPUBLICANS TO MOVE ON THE 

2829
01:42:01,748 --> 01:42:02,716
NOMINATION SOONER RATHER THAN 

2830
01:42:02,716 --> 01:42:02,949
LATER. 

2831
01:42:02,949 --> 01:42:03,784
>> TWO OTHER POINTS THAT STRUCK 

2832
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:05,452
ME, HE WAS ASKED DIRECTLYABOUT 

2833
01:42:05,452 --> 01:42:13,594
A QUESTION WHETHER DON McGANN 

2834
01:42:13,594 --> 01:42:14,495
WAS OVERSEEING THIS, AND WHAT 

2835
01:42:14,495 --> 01:42:15,696
HE DIRECT HIM TO ALLOW THE FBI 

2836
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:16,830
THE FULL WEIGHT OF ITS POWERS 

2837
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:17,698
TO INVESTIGATE ALL OF THESE 

2838
01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:18,265
ALLEGATIONS, THE PRESIDENT 

2839
01:42:18,265 --> 01:42:18,832
ANSWERING QUESTIONS AROUND 

2840
01:42:18,832 --> 01:42:19,600
THAT, AND THE OTHER THING I 

2841
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:20,600
THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING, ONCE 

2842
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:21,902
AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT REFLECTING 

2843
01:42:21,902 --> 01:42:28,141
BACK WHAT IS HAPPENING IN BRETT 

2844
01:42:28,141 --> 01:42:28,809
KAVANAUGH'S LIFE THROUGH THE 

2845
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:30,344
PRISM OF HIS OWN EXPERIENCES, 

2846
01:42:30,344 --> 01:42:33,180
IN SUGGESTING THAT HE WAS 

2847
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:33,847
TREATED UNFAIRLY, THAT HE 

2848
01:42:33,847 --> 01:42:34,314
UNDERSTANDS WHAT BRETT 

2849
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:35,115
úKAVANAU 

2850
01:42:35,115 --> 01:42:41,121
>> TO THIS LAST POINT, THE 

2851
01:42:41,121 --> 01:42:41,989
PRESIDENT USE THE WORD TRAUMA, 

2852
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:42,789
THE TRAUMA INFLICTED ON BRETT 

2853
01:42:42,789 --> 01:42:44,123
KAVANAUGH AND HIS WIFE AND 

2854
01:42:44,123 --> 01:42:45,559
FAMILY, DRAWING FROM HIS WHITE 

2855
01:42:45,559 --> 01:42:46,994
HOUSE'S PERSPECTIVE, IF NOT A 

2856
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:50,163
MORAL EQUIVALENCE, THE PAIN 

2857
01:42:50,163 --> 01:42:52,566
SUFFERED BY ALL OF THOSE 

2858
01:42:52,566 --> 01:42:57,704
SUFFERING IN THIS DRAMA, BUT TO 

2859
01:42:57,704 --> 01:42:58,639
YOUR FIRST QUESTION, IS VERY 

2860
01:42:58,639 --> 01:42:59,673
IMPORTANT, NOT JUST AS A MATTER 

2861
01:42:59,673 --> 01:43:01,542
OF PROCESS, BUT EXECUTIVE POWER 

2862
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:04,411
IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE 

2863
01:43:04,411 --> 01:43:05,612
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. 

2864
01:43:05,612 --> 01:43:06,547
THE PRESIDENT JUST SAID TO THE 

2865
01:43:06,547 --> 01:43:08,282
UNITED STATES, EVERYONE IN THIS 

2866
01:43:08,282 --> 01:43:10,517
COUNTRY, I AM DEFERRING TO THE 

2867
01:43:10,517 --> 01:43:11,318
SENATE REPUBLICANS ON WHAT THE 

2868
01:43:11,318 --> 01:43:13,420
FBI SHOULD DO. 

2869
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:14,655
ESSENTIALLY HANDING OVER HIS 

2870
01:43:14,655 --> 01:43:15,989
EXECUTIVE POWERS TO THE SENATE 

2871
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:18,192
REPUBLICANS, AND THE CHAIRMAN 

2872
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:22,395
OF THAT SENATE JUDICIARY 

2873
01:43:22,395 --> 01:43:22,995
COMMITTEE AND THE MAJORITY 

2874
01:43:22,995 --> 01:43:24,331
LEADER, CHUCK GRASSLEY, AND 

2875
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:26,833
MITCH McCONNELL, HAVE MADE IT 

2876
01:43:26,833 --> 01:43:27,701
FUNDAMENTALLY CLEAR THEY WANT 

2877
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:28,901
TO SEE BRETT KAVANAUGH 

2878
01:43:28,901 --> 01:43:34,641
CONFIRMED. 

2879
01:43:34,641 --> 01:43:36,076
SO THE FBI, BY THE WORDS OF THE 

2880
01:43:36,076 --> 01:43:36,944
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 

2881
01:43:36,944 --> 01:43:38,378
IS TAKING ITS DIRECTIVES OR ITS 

2882
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:39,646
OUTLINES FROM SENATE 

2883
01:43:39,646 --> 01:43:40,414
REPUBLICANS, THE LEADERSHIP OF 

2884
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:41,281
WHICH HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY 

2885
01:43:41,281 --> 01:43:42,148
WANT TO SEE HIM CONFIRMED, 

2886
01:43:42,148 --> 01:43:44,818
THAT'S JUST AN ORIENTATION TO 

2887
01:43:44,818 --> 01:43:46,353
THE SCOPE AND TIMING OF THIS 

2888
01:43:46,353 --> 01:43:47,521
INVESTIATION. 

2889
01:43:47,521 --> 01:43:50,257
AND, FOR THOSE ON THE 

2890
01:43:50,257 --> 01:43:52,559
DEMOCRATIC SIDE WHO THINK IT IS 

2891
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:57,431
A MERE PROCEDURAL DELAY, IN 

2892
01:43:57,431 --> 01:43:58,365
ADVANCE OF A FOREGONE 

2893
01:43:58,365 --> 01:43:58,999
CONCLUSION, THE PRESIDENT'S OWN 

2894
01:43:58,999 --> 01:44:00,100
WORDS WOULD CERTAINLY GIVE THEM 

2895
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:01,501
EVIDENCE TO HAVE NOT CONFIRMED 

2896
01:44:01,501 --> 01:44:04,404
THAT SUSPICION, AT LEAST POINT 

2897
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:07,040
TO IT.>> MAJOR GARRETT, FROM 

2898
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,408
THE ROSE GARDEN, WHERE WE JUST 

2899
01:44:08,408 --> 01:44:09,676
HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAKING, 

2900
01:44:09,676 --> 01:44:12,412
WE THINK YOU.

2901
01:44:12,412 --> 01:44:16,650
>>> PAULA REID IS STILL WITH 

2902
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:25,125
US, AGAIN, THIS QUESTION AS TO 

2903
01:44:25,125 --> 01:44:26,159
THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE 

2904
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:26,994
INVESTIGATION THAT THE FBI IS 

2905
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:27,694
UNDERTAKING OVER THE NEXT 

2906
01:44:27,694 --> 01:44:28,461
COUPLE OF DAYS, THE PRESIDENT 

2907
01:44:28,461 --> 01:44:29,596
SAYS HE WANTS IT WRAPPED UP 

2908
01:44:29,596 --> 01:44:31,198
QUICKLY, BUT HE SAID HE WANTED 

2909
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:33,900
TO BE COMPREHENSIVE, TO SOME, 

2910
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:35,435
THEY SAID IT MIGHT NOT BECOME 

2911
01:44:35,435 --> 01:44:39,106
PRE--- POSSIBLE, BUT OTHERS SAY 

2912
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:40,006
THE FBI HAS ENORMOUS RESOURCES, 

2913
01:44:40,006 --> 01:44:47,380
AND CAN FIELD ENORMOUS AGENTS 

2914
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:47,848
TO UNCOVER THIS? 

2915
01:44:47,848 --> 01:44:48,715
>> REMEMBER, THIS IS THE 

2916
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:49,682
SEVENTH TIME THE FBI HAS DONE 

2917
01:44:49,682 --> 01:44:50,516
ONE OF THESE BACKGROUND CHECKS, 

2918
01:44:50,516 --> 01:44:51,918
THIS IS NOT A TRADITIONAL 

2919
01:44:51,918 --> 01:44:54,087
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, THEY 

2920
01:44:54,087 --> 01:44:55,355
ARE JUST SUPPLEMENTING HIS 

2921
01:44:55,355 --> 01:44:57,190
BACKGROUND CHECK, THE WHITE 

2922
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:57,924
HOUSE IS A CLIENT, DOING 

2923
01:44:57,924 --> 01:45:02,362
RESEARCH, IN THIS INSTANCE, THE 

2924
01:45:02,362 --> 01:45:03,663
QUESTIONS ARE PRETTY NARROW AND 

2925
01:45:03,663 --> 01:45:06,033
SPECIFIC. 

2926
01:45:06,033 --> 01:45:08,235
THE ISSUE IS HOW MANY WITNESSES,

2927
01:45:08,235 --> 01:45:11,305
IT WAS SUGGESTED UP TO 20, HOW 

2928
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:12,372
MANY OF THE CLAIMS THEY DELVE 

2929
01:45:12,372 --> 01:45:13,974
INTO, RIGHT NOW THERE ARE THREE 

2930
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:22,282
CLAIMS, ANOTHER ONE FROM JULIE 

2931
01:45:22,282 --> 01:45:25,452
SWETNICK, WHO HAS COME UNDER 

2932
01:45:25,452 --> 01:45:28,522
SOME FIRE ABOUT WHETHER IT IS 

2933
01:45:28,522 --> 01:45:32,259
LEGITIMATE, AND THE QUESTION IS 

2934
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:33,126
WHETHER HE IS AUTHORIZED THE 

2935
01:45:33,126 --> 01:45:35,762
FBI TO LOOK IN ALL THREE CAN 

2936
01:45:35,762 --> 01:45:39,499
NAMES -- CLAIMS, FROM THIS 

2937
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:40,534
PRESS CONFERENCE, IT'S NOT 

2938
01:45:40,534 --> 01:45:44,504
CLEAR, THE PRESIDENT WAS GIVING 

2939
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:50,110
THEM CARTE BLANCHE FROM HIM, 

2940
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:51,278
BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT WE HAVE 

2941
01:45:51,278 --> 01:45:52,312
SEEN, WE HAVE SEEN LEAKS FROM 

2942
01:45:52,312 --> 01:45:54,013
TH FBI, THEY WANTED TO SEND A 

2943
01:45:54,013 --> 01:45:56,016
SIGNAL TO SAY THEY WERE NOT 

2944
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:57,684
ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING THEY WANT 

2945
01:45:57,684 --> 01:45:59,986
TO DO. 

2946
01:45:59,986 --> 01:46:01,021
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 

2947
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:01,655
IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL 

2948
01:46:01,655 --> 01:46:03,957
CONVERSATIONS TO OPEN THIS UP, 

2949
01:46:03,957 --> 01:46:05,091
AND WHAT IF ANY ROLE THE SENATE 

2950
01:46:05,091 --> 01:46:08,161
PLAYS GIVEN THE FBI MORE BROAD 

2951
01:46:08,161 --> 01:46:09,396
AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE THESE 

2952
01:46:09,396 --> 01:46:09,629
CLAIMS. 

2953
01:46:09,629 --> 01:46:12,299
>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING, THE 

2954
01:46:12,299 --> 01:46:13,734
PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT THESE 

2955
01:46:13,734 --> 01:46:18,338
QUESTIONS WITH REGARD TO MR. 

2956
01:46:18,338 --> 01:46:18,938
KAVANAUGH'S DRINKING HABITS 

2957
01:46:18,938 --> 01:46:20,073
WHEN HE WAS A YOUNGER MAN AND 

2958
01:46:20,073 --> 01:46:21,340
LATER YEARS, IN COLLEGE FOR 

2959
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:27,481
EXAMPLE, IF IT TURNS OUT THAT 

2960
01:46:27,481 --> 01:46:29,049
HE BASICALLY LIED TO THE SENATE 

2961
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:30,250
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, IS THAT 

2962
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:35,555
CONSIDERED PERJURY? 

2963
01:46:35,555 --> 01:46:36,523
I AM SORT OF TRYING TO 

2964
01:46:36,523 --> 01:46:37,457
RECONCILE THE REPORT THAT WAS 

2965
01:46:37,457 --> 01:46:38,492
LEAKED FROM RACHEL MITCHELL, 

2966
01:46:38,492 --> 01:46:39,626
WHO POKED A LOT OF HOLES IN 

2967
01:46:39,626 --> 01:46:44,164
DOCTOR FORD'S TESTIMONY, SAYING 

2968
01:46:44,164 --> 01:46:45,365
THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF KEY 

2969
01:46:45,365 --> 01:46:46,166
THINGS SHE COULD REMEMBER, AND 

2970
01:46:46,166 --> 01:46:47,067
SOME PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT 

2971
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,034
RECALL EVER HAVING BEEN AT A 

2972
01:46:48,034 --> 01:46:49,069
PARTY SHE SAID SHE WAS AT. 

2973
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:51,505
BUT THAT IS JUST MEMORY, THIS 

2974
01:46:51,505 --> 01:46:56,143
IS NOW, TALKING TO THE SENATE 

2975
01:46:56,143 --> 01:46:59,579
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, TESTIFYING,

2976
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:01,214
IF THEY FIND OUT YOU ARE LYING, 

2977
01:47:01,214 --> 01:47:02,448
THAT IS PERJURY, IS THAT RIGHT? 

2978
01:47:02,448 --> 01:47:03,683
>> IF YOU LIE UNDER OATH, THAT 

2979
01:47:03,683 --> 01:47:06,319
IS PERJURY, THAT IS WHY PEOPLE 

2980
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:07,754
WERE TRYING TO PIN THE 

2981
01:47:07,754 --> 01:47:09,356
PRESIDENT DOWN, IT MIGHT BE 

2982
01:47:09,356 --> 01:47:11,057
DIFFICULT TO PURSUE HER CLAIMS, 

2983
01:47:11,057 --> 01:47:14,861
OR OTHER CLAIMS, IT CAN BOIL 

2984
01:47:14,861 --> 01:47:19,566
DOWN TO A HE SAID/SHE SHOULD -- 

2985
01:47:19,566 --> 01:47:26,106
SHE SAID, IT HAS SWITCH TO 

2986
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:26,706
WHETHER HE HAS POSSIBLY 

2987
01:47:26,706 --> 01:47:27,607
PERJURED HIMSELF BASED ON HIS 

2988
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:30,710
OWN ASSESSMENTS OF HIS DRINKING 

2989
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:31,511
AND HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE, 

2990
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:32,946
BUT WE NEED TO GO BACK AND LOOK 

2991
01:47:32,946 --> 01:47:34,014
AT HOW HE CHARACTERIZED IT, AT 

2992
01:47:34,014 --> 01:47:36,917
ONE POINT HE WAS VERY DEFENSIVE,

2993
01:47:36,917 --> 01:47:37,951
VERY COMBATIVE, BUT IT'S FAIR 

2994
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:39,953
TO SAY THAT MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT 

2995
01:47:39,953 --> 01:47:42,422
HAVE, IF THEY ARE HONEST AND 

2996
01:47:42,422 --> 01:47:44,824
OBJECTIVE, THEIR RELATIONSHIP 

2997
01:47:44,824 --> 01:47:47,761
WITH ALCOHOL, WE ARE GETTING 

2998
01:47:47,761 --> 01:47:48,929
INTO UNCHARTED TERRITORY 

2999
01:47:48,929 --> 01:47:51,531
WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY SHOULD 

3000
01:47:51,531 --> 01:47:52,499
BE KEPT FROM A SUPREME COURT 

3001
01:47:52,499 --> 01:47:57,971
SEAT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT GIVE 

3002
01:47:57,971 --> 01:47:58,905
AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF THE 

3003
01:47:58,905 --> 01:47:59,573
RELATIONSHIP WITH ALCOHOL IN 

3004
01:47:59,573 --> 01:48:01,040
HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE, IT IS 

3005
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:04,477
FASCINATING, IT DOES SEEM THAT 

3006
01:48:04,477 --> 01:48:05,412
A CONVERSATION WILL SHIFT FROM 

3007
01:48:05,412 --> 01:48:07,914
THESE CLAIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, 

3008
01:48:07,914 --> 01:48:08,982
TO WHETHER OR NOT HE ACCURATELY 

3009
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:09,916
REPRESENTED HIS DRINKING. 

3010
01:48:09,916 --> 01:48:12,452
>> THE FORMER DEPUTY OF THE FBI 

3011
01:48:12,452 --> 01:48:15,956
SAID THAT HE SAID IT'S KIND OF 

3012
01:48:15,956 --> 01:48:19,326
SUBJECTIVE, WHEN IT COMES TO 

3013
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:20,493
ALCOHOL, WHAT KNOCKS IS A REAL 

3014
01:48:20,493 --> 01:48:23,263
SUCK, A COUPLE OF BEERS, YOU 

3015
01:48:23,263 --> 01:48:23,930
KNOW WHAT I MEAN? 

3016
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:25,799
IT IS HARD TO KNOW WHEN YOU'RE 

3017
01:48:25,799 --> 01:48:28,434
TALKING ABOUT ALCOHOL, TWO 

3018
01:48:28,434 --> 01:48:29,702
BEERS FOR ONE PERSON IS A BIG 

3019
01:48:29,702 --> 01:48:30,470
DEAL, AND SIX BEERS WERE 

3020
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:31,504
ANOTHER PERSON IS NOT SUCH A 

3021
01:48:31,504 --> 01:48:34,140
BIG DEAL?>> EXACTLY, AND MANY 

3022
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:35,008
PEOPLE, GETTING OUTSIDE THE LAW 

3023
01:48:35,008 --> 01:48:36,042
AND LIFE EXPERIENCE, MANY OF US 

3024
01:48:36,042 --> 01:48:39,813
KNOW PEOPLE WHO MAYBE HAVE 

3025
01:48:39,813 --> 01:48:40,913
PROBLEMS WITH ALCOHOL WHO DON'T 

3026
01:48:40,913 --> 01:48:43,617
REALLY HAVE AN OBJECTIVE 

3027
01:48:43,617 --> 01:48:44,450
ASSESSMENT OF THEIR OWN 

3028
01:48:44,450 --> 01:48:45,184
RELATIONSHIP WITH DRINKING, AND 

3029
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:45,785
IT'S ALSO SUBJECTIVE, WHAT 

3030
01:48:45,785 --> 01:48:47,486
KNOCKS ME OUT MAY NOT KNOCK YOU 

3031
01:48:47,486 --> 01:48:53,026
OUT, IT'S VERY UNCHARTED, SOFT, 

3032
01:48:53,026 --> 01:48:53,994
SUBJECTIVE TERRITORY, AND I 

3033
01:48:53,994 --> 01:48:54,761
