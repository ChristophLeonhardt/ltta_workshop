ONE YEAR INTO THE TRUMP
PRESIDENCY IT WOULD BE
INACCURATE TO SAY THAT TRUMP
HASN'T DONE ANYTHING, HASN'T
MADE ANY MOVES WHEN IT COMES TO
ADDRESSING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC.
HE HAS BEEN, BUT THEY HAPPEN TO
BE IN THE EXACT WRONG DIRECTION.
HAVE A GOOD EXAMPLE WHEN IT
COMES TO FUNDING, WE HAVE
INFORMATION ABOUT HIS UPCOMING
BUDGET PLANS WHEN IT COMES TO
THE NATIONAL OFFICE OF DRUG
CONTROL POLICY, AND THEY ARE
PLANNING TO CUT VIRTUALLY EVERY
DOLLAR FROM TWO OF THE MAJOR
PROGRAMS IN THAT OFFICE THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH COMBATING THE
OPIOID EPIDEMIC --
>>THAT IS 
A LOT.
IT'S NOT
EVERYTHING --
>>FAKE NEWS, YOU SAID I MOST
EVERYTHING.
THAT'S ONLY 95%.
>>WE ALWAYS SAID THAT UNDER
OBAMA WE GOT 5% CHANGE, HE'S
FINISHING THE LAST 95% OF IT.
THEY ARE SAYING DON'T WORRY SO
MUCH ABOUT THIS --
>>OKAY, THEY WON'T BE GETTING
THE FUNDING BUT ONCE THEY GET
MOVED TO THIS NEW PLACE THE
FUNDING WILL PROBABLY COME
ABOUT, BUT YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND
THAT THIS COMES AFTER LAST YEAR
WHEN --
>>THERE WAS A LOT OF PUSHBACK
AGAINST THAT LAST YEAR, THEN WE
COME TO THIS YEAR WHERE THEY ARE
LIKE, OKAY, WE ARE CUTTING 95%
OF IT, IT WILL BE FINE
OVER THERE I'M SURE.
I'M NOT CONVINCED AT THIS POINT.
>>WHEN I FIRST STARTED READING
THE STORY I THOUGHT, I THINK I
MIGHT DEFEND TRUMP HERE.
AND
MAYBE I'LL TALK TO JOHN ABOUT
TAKING IT OUT OF THE RUNDOWN, IF
THEY ARE JUST MOVING STUFF WHO
CARES?
THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO
MOVE IT FROM ONE PART OF THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO ANOTHER.
BUT
SILLY ME TO HAVE TRUSTED THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM HALF A
STORY.
WHEN I WAS REMINDED, OH
RIGHT, THEY TRIED TO CUT THIS
BUDGET COMPLETELY JUST A LITTLE
WHILE AGO.
THAT'S IMPORTANT
CONTEXT.
THEN WIPING OUT 95% OF
THE BUDGET AND SAYING DON'T
WORRY, LATER THAT WILL REAPPEAR
SOMEWHERE ELSE, BECOMES LESS
BELIEVABLE.
HE DECLARED THE
OPIOID CRISIS A NATIONAL
EMERGENCY MYRA MEMBER THE POOR
DAD WHO REALLY BELIEVED IN TRUMP
ANYONE AROUND TO A LOT OF TRUMP
RALLIES AND HE SAYING, HE HAD A
GUITAR, HE WAS TRYING TO DRAW
ATTENTION BECAUSE HIS SON HAD
DIED FROM THIS CRISIS, THEN THEY
INTERVIEWED HIM AFTERWARDS WHEN
TRUMP ORIGINALLY BASICALLY SAID
I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND ANYTHING
ON IT, AND HE WAS LIKE, NO, WHAT
HAPPENED?
HE WAS HEARTBROKEN
OVER IT.
WHAT HAPPENED IS, ON
EVERY SINGLE ISSUE HE LIED TO
YOU.
NOW, NATIONAL EMERGENCY,
HE'S NOT GOING TO SPEND ANY
MONEY ON IT.
WHERE DOES IT MAKE
ME MONEY?
THIS DOESN'T HELP MY
DONORS AT ALL.
IN FACT, PERHAPS
SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN DONORS
ARE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WHO
DON'T WANT YOU TO DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THE OPIOID CRISIS, AND ALL
OF A SUDDEN ENTIRE DEPARTMENTS
GO AWAY.
INTERESTING.
>>THIS CRISIS KILLS 91 AMERICANS
EVERY DAY, SUPERSEDING CAR
CRASHES NOW.
MORE AMERICANS DIE
FROM OPIOID ADDICTION THEN CAR
CRASHES.
TRUMP DECLARED HE WOULD
REALLY TACKLE THE OPIOID
EPIDEMIC.
WHAT DID HE DO?
HE
PICKED PEOPLE WITHIN THE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO RUN
DRUG MANAGEMENT LIKE HE'S DOING
EVERYWHERE.
I JUST INTERVIEWED
THE LAWYER WHO IS ATTACKING THE
DRUG PUSHERS, HE IS SAYING IT'S
NOT THE DOCTORS, WE CAN BLAME
ADDICTS OR DOCTORS, IT'S THE
DRUG PUSHERS WHO PREY ON
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND
EXPLOIT THEM, AND WE NEED TO GO
AFTER THEM.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO
TRUMP, HE'S JUST LINING THE
POCKETS OF HIS FRIENDS JUST LIKE
HE DOES WITH EVERY PROBLEM IN
EVERY SCENARIO.
>>AND SAYING WE ARE JUST MOVING
IT, NOT KILLING IT, IT REMINDS
ME, WE JUST REPORTED ON THE
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION
BUREAU, THEY TRIED TO STOP IT
FROM BEING ESTABLISHED YEARS
AGO, THEN THEY TRIED TO KILL IT
YEAR AFTER YEAR, THEY HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO, SO WHAT DO THEY
DO?
THEY PUT SOMEONE IN CONTROL
OF IT THAT REQUESTED ZERO
DOLLARS FOR THE BUDGET.
IT'S
LIKE KILLING IT BY ANY OTHER
NAME.
AND IT IS JUST THIS, YOU
CUT THOSE TWO PROGRAMS, THAT'S
NOT THE ONLY THING THEY COULD
HAVE DONE THEORETICALLY TO DEAL
WITH THE CRISIS, BUT IT'S PART
OF A LONG PATTERN.
THAT SAME
OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL
POLICY, HE STILL HAS NOT NAMED A
PERMANENT DIRECTOR OF IT.
SEEMS
LIKE IF YOU CARE ABOUT THIS
EPIDEMIC THAT YOU HAVE LABELED A
NATIONAL EMERGENCY, YOU WOULD AT
LEAST HAVE SOMEONE OTHER THAN --
WASN'T CRIST CHRISTIE SUPPOSED
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE OPIOID
EPIDEMIC?
MAYBE JARED IS DOING
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
BUT IT'S NOT
JUST THAT, LAST YEAR HE GOT SOME
GOOD PRESS FOR ALLOCATING SOME
FUNDING TO DEAL WITH IT, NEVER
MEMBER REPORTING ON IT, IT WAS
1% OF WHAT EXPERTS SAY WOULD BE
NEEDED TO ADEQUATELY DEAL WITH
THE EPIDEMIC ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
AND YOU SAID HE DECLARED IT A
HEALTH EMERGENCY, I'VE ALSO
FOUND REFERENCES, HE CALLED IT
A NATIONAL SHAME, I HUMAN
TRAGEDY, AND VOWED TO WIN.
>>YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS A HUMAN
TRAGEDY?
THE ATTACKS ON
MARIJUANA, WHICH ARE LEGAL
ALTERNATIVES, AND A LOT OF THESE
STATES HE IS OVERWRITING STATES
RIGHTS AND DOING THESE GIANT
DRUG WARS ON DRUGS THAT COULD
HELP PEOPLE WITH PAIN MANAGEMENT
AND ALTERNATIVES TO HEROIN AND
OPIOIDS.
IT'S DISGUSTING, JEFF
SESSIONS'S INSANE REEFER
MADNESS.
>>WHAT DECADE IS HE FROM?
>>FROM THE KEEBLER ELF COOKIE
BOX.
>>WHEN I WAS A KID MARIJUANA,
GATEWAY DRUG.
WE FOUND THE
GATEWAY DRUG, THE JURY IS IN,
IT'S PRESCRIPTION PAIN RELIEF
SO-CALLED DRUGS.
FIRST OF ALL
THEY DON'T HAVE TO LEAD TO
ANYTHING, YOU GET ADDICTED TO
THE PAINKILLERS AND A LOT OF
PEOPLE DIE FROM THAT, AND SOME
OF IT LEADS TO HEROIN AND A LOT
OF PEOPLE DIE FROM THAT, AND SO
WE KNOW WHAT THE GATEWAY DRUG IS
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY
MAKE BILLIONS OFF THE GATEWAY
DRUG.
AND MARIJUANA IN STATES
WHERE IT'S LEGAL THEY ARE
STARTING TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF
IT, ALL OF A SUDDEN REPUBLICANS
ARE LIKE, MARIJUANA ISN'T SO
BAD.
BUT THEY STILL FIGHT IT
OVERALL BECAUSE THE DRUG
COMPANIES, DAMMIT, IT'S JUST A
PLANT, IT'S HARDER TO MAKE MONEY
OFF A PLANT.
WE HAVE TO TRY TO
CREATE SOME FAKE VERSION THAT IS
EVEN MORE ADDICTIVE SO THEY CAN
PATENT IT AND MAKE MORE MONEY
AND BUY OFF THESE POLITICIANS.
FINALLY, THIS EPIDEMIC IS SO OUT
OF CONTROL THAT EVEN
REPUBLICANS, ESPECIALLY IN
AFFLICTED STATES LIKE WEST
VIRGINIA AND OHIO, ARE LIKE, NO,
DON'T AGREE WITH TRUMP, WE HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.
AND
IT'S NOT JUST US SAYING HE'S
TRYING TO KILL THE PROGRAM AND
NOT MOVE IT, SHELLEY MOORE
CAPITO FROM WEST VIRGINIA AND
ROB PORTMAN FROM OHIO, BOTH
DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS,
ARE SAYING DON'T MOVE IT, DON'T
KILL IT, DON'T DEFUND IT, WE
NEED THIS MONEY.
LITERALLY WE
ARE DYING HERE.
AND HE SAYS TO
THE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, I
DON'T CARE, YOU AREN'T A DONOR.
GO DIE SOMEWHERE ELSE.
>>THE FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY
IS AS WILL BE THE CASE WITH
EVERY OTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW
EXPENSIVE IT WOULD BE TO DO
THINGS I WANT TO DO, I WILL
COMPARE IT TO THE $1.5 TRILLION
THEY JUST DECIDED TO HAND TO
CORPORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY.
WE
COULD CURE THIS EPIDEMIC AND IT
WOULD BE A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT
THEY JUST CASUALLY GAVE AWAY
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY
WEALTHY THAN THE EMPERORS FROM
THROUGHOUT HUMAN HISTORY.
>>JOHN, THAT IS SUCH A GOOD
POINT.
NEVER THEY TELL YOU,
OPIOID CRISIS, YOUR SON DIED
FROM IT AND YOU BELIEVED IN
TRUMP AND ALL THIS, BUT WE DON'T
HAVE THE MONEY -- THEY JUST GAVE
AWAY $1.5 TRILLION TO THE
RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY.
THEY HAVE THE MONEY, THEY JUST
DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.
