WHY IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE 
SUPER MOON WE SAW EARLIER IN 
THE YEAR WHERE IT APPEARED THE  
MOON WAS MUCH BIGGER. 
>> Reporter: THE MOON IS AT I 
TS -- FROM EARTH. 
TONIGHT IT WILL REACH THE 4,500-
KILOMETER POINT. 
>> THAT'S WHY IT'S GOING TO 
TAKE SO LONG. 
>> THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE 
ACTUALLY WILL HAVE THE LONGEST 
LUNAR ECLIPSE IN THE 21st 
CENTURY. 
THIS IS A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF SIX 
HOURS AND 14 MINUTES. 
WITH TOTALITY OF 103 MINUTES, 
ONE HOUR 43 MINUTES. 
>> SO EFFECTIVELY YOU AND I 
WILL NEVER SEE AN ECLIPSE LIKE 
THIS AGAIN. 
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S NOT GOING TO 
HAPPEN FOR WHAT OVER 100 YEARS. 
>> WE WILL SEE TOTALITY 
ECLIPSES HAPPENING AGAIN BUT 
NOTHING THIS LONG. 
THIS IS THE LONGEST, YES. 
>> WHAT ELSE IS EXCITING ABOUT 
THESE OTHER THINGS THAT COULD 
HAPPEN TONIGHT AS WELL. 
>> WELL, WE HAVE THE METEOR 
SHOWER HAPPENING. 
SO WHEN THE MOON MOVES INTO 
TOTALITY. 
>> WHEN IT'S TOTALLY BLACK. 
>> TOTALLY BLACK LOCAL TIME AT 
21 MINUTES PAST 10. 
YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE A 
SHOOTING STAR OR TWO. 
>> WON'T THAT BE GREAT. 
>> YOU WILL ALSO HAVE MARS AT 
THE CLOSEST. 
YOU WILL SEE THAT ORANGE BLOB 
ON THE SIDE OF THE MOON THAT 
WILL BE MARS. 
OTHER THAN THE SAND STORM THAT 
TOOK PLACE IN MARS OVER THE 
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WE SHOULD 
BE ABLE TO SEE A LOT OF DETAIL. 
THE SAND IS SUBSIDING FROM THE 
ORBIT OF MARS AND IT WILL BE A 
VERY INTERESTING OBJECT TO BE 
SEEING. 
>> MOST EXCITING IS A BLOOD 
MOON WHICH IS NOT A SCIENTIFIC 
MOON BUT IT'S WHAT'S SO 
EXCITING. 
WHAT GIVES THE MOON ITS RED 
COLOR AND IS IT AFFECTED BY 
THINGS LIKE POLLUTION AND 
DEBRIS. 
>> YES AND NO. 
BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS EARTH 
HAS GOT AN ATMOSPHERE AROUND 
IT. 
IT ACTS LIKE A LENS AND LIGHT 
WILL SCATTER AWAY AND THE RAYS 
OF LIGHT WILL TRAVEL THROUGH 
THE ATMOSPHERE AND BE SLIGHTLY 
BENT LIKE YOU WOULD BEND LIGHT 
THROUGH AN AT PHOS FEAR. 
THAT'S WHY YOU WILL ACTUALLY 
SEE THAT THE MOON PROGRESSIVELY 
GETS DARKER. 
BECAUSE THAT WILL GET MORE OR 
LESS IN THE CONE OF THE SHADOW. 
>> WE KNOW IN MODERN TIMES 
WE'RE ABLE TO PREDICT WITH 
PRECISION WHEN A LUNAR ECLIPSE 
WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE. 
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE. 
A BLOOD MOON COULD BE A THOUGHT 
THERE COULD BE CALAMITY 
SURROUNDING THIS EVENT. 
>> IN GENERAL, SOLAR ECLIPSES 
THE LUNAR ECLIPSE IN THOSE DAYS 
SAW THIS AS A BAD OE MEN. 
THEY SAW THAT THERE'S -- BAD 
OMEN AND THERE'S DROUGHT COMING 
FOR SEVEN YEARS. 
AND EVERY NOW AND AGAIN WE 
ACTUALLY HIT A POINT WHERE THEY 
GET INTO EACH OTHER'S WAYS. 
THIS YEAR WE WOULD ACTUALLY SEE 
A TOTAL OF FIVE ECLIPSES, TWO 
LUNAR ONE HAPPENS IN JANUARY. 
WE CAN NOW PREDICT THAT THE 
NEXT LUNAR ECLIPSE TOTALITY 
WE'LL SEE WILL ONLY HAPPEN IN 
2025. 
EVEN THOUGH IT IS ANOTHER LUNAR 
ECLIPSE VISIBLE FROM THE 
NORTHERN AMERICAN AREA IN 
JANUARY OF 2019. 
IT WILL NOT BE VISIBLE FOR US. 
>> Reporter: THERE'S ANOTHER 
EXTREME HAPPENING. 
IN ODDEN  -- OLDEN TIMES IT WAS 
A PREDICTOR OF DROUGHT, HEAT 
WAVES, WILDFIRES IN ATHENS THEN 
FLASH FLOODS AND ELSEWHERE 
AROUND THE GLOBE. 
DOES THIS ECLIPSE AFFECT THE 
WEATHER IN ANY WAY? 
>> NO IT'S MERE COINCIDENCE. 
IT IS PURELY THE OBJECTS IN THE 
SKY FOLLOWING THEIR AGE OF 
PAUSE. 
AND YES IT HAPPENS EVERY NOW 
AND AGAIN THEY CROSS PATHS AND 
WE SEE ECLIPSES BUT IT DOES NOT 
INFLUENCE ANY HAPPENINGS ON THE 
EARTH. 
SO NO, THE BLOOD MOON MOST THEY 
ARE -- 
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT TONYA. 
NO BAD OMENS JUST A LOT OF 
EXCITEMENT FROM HERE 
JOHANNESBURG AFRICA. 
>> WE WILL CONTINUE TO CHECK IN 
WITH DEBRA THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
BRINGING YOU THE LATEST ON THE 
ECLIPSE. 
>>> THE LATEST ON A COLLEGE 
STUDENT WHO WENT MISSING WHILE 
JOGGING. 
HOW POLICE ARE TRACKING HER
