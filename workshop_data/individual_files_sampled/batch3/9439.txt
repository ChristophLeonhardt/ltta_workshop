THIS IS WELCOME NEWS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. Martha: ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU SIR, THANKS FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. MY NEXT GUEST IS THE AFOREMENTIONED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND I'M REPORTEDLY BACK IN THE POLITICAL GAME JOINING VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. CORY LEWANDOWSKI JOINS ME KNOW. GOOD TO SEE YOU, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE TONIGHT. THIS WAS ALSO IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" PIECE. EVEN AS HE PLACES HIS PUBLIC ROMANCE WITH PRAISE FOR THE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AND A SIMPLE ONE OF STAFF ARE UNSETTLING A GROUP OF MR. TRUMP'S FIERCE LOYALIST WHO FEAR THEY ARE FORGING A SEPARATE POWER BASE. IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE DOING? LOOK, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WILL EVER ACCUSE ME OF BEING ANYTHING OTHER THAN A DONALD TRUMP LOYALIST. I WAS THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER, I WAS THERE WHEN WE TURNED THE LIGHTS ON AND I'M HONORED TO BE JOINING THE VICE PRESIDENTS PACK SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO RAISE MONEY WITH THE EXPLICIT GOAL OF SUPPORTING CANDIDATES WHO ARE SUPPORTING THE TRUMP-PENCE AGENDA THROUGH HARD MONEY CONTRIBUTIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE RETAINING OUR MAJORITY IN THE U.S. HOUSE. THAT IS THE FOCUS OF THE PENCE PACT THAT I AM NOW PART OF AND THAT IS COMPLETELY WITH THE BLESSING OF THE UNITED STATES. Martha: IN TERMS OF ALL THESE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE RELEASED TODAY, THOUSANDS OF PAGES FROM DONALD TRUMP JR.'S TRANSCRIPT, THIS IS WHAT HE E TRANSCRIPT, THIS IS WHAT HE S TRANSCRIPT, THIS IS WHAT HE I TRANSCRIPT, THIS IS WHAT HE D ABOUT IT. FOR OVER FIVE HOURS I ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION ASKED AND WAS CANDID AND FORTHRIGHT WITH THE COMMITTEE. YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHERE THIS WHOLE THING IS GOING? I THINK DON JR. IS EXACTLY RIGHT. I'VE BEEN VERY PUBLIC. I'VE HAD THE UNFORTUNATE PRIVILEGE OF SITTING BEFORE THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE COMMITTEES TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. I DID IT VOLUNTARILY. YOU SIT THERE AS LONG AS THEY NEED YOU TO TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION TO PROVE ONCE AGAIN THERE WAS NO COLLUSION IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM AND THAT'S WHAT DON JR. DID SHOWS. HE SAT FOR FIVE HOURS AND ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION THEY ASKED AND THEN HE FINALLY GOT UP AND LEFT AND NOW WE SEE THOSE ANSWERS IN WRITING AND IT SHOWS EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID. THERE WAS NO COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE OUTSIDE INFLUENCER. Martha: WE WILL GET INTO THIS MORE IN A MOMENT BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BYR SOME COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BYD SOME COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BYY GIULIANI WHO IS NOW REPRESENTING THE PRESIDENT IN THIS MATTER. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A PRESIDENTIAL INDICTMENT. HE SAID THEY CAN'T INDICT, AT LEAST THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TO US AFTER SOME BATTLING, THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT TO US HE SAYS. THIS GOES BACK TO I BELIEVE IT'S A 1999 CLINTON ERA MEMO, BILL CLINTON ERA MEMO THAT WAS WRITTEN THAT SAID A SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CANNOT BE INDICTED AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED NOW FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS AND THAT HAS BEEN THE RULES AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE MAYOR IS SAYING IS THE MUELLER TEAM ABIDE BY THAT MEMO AND UNDERSTANDS IT TO BE ACCURATE AND THERE IS NO INDICTMENT COMING FOR THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO COLLUSION, THERE WAS NO COORDINATION. THERE IS NOTHING TO INDICT HIM FOR OTHER THAN PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. IF THAT'S A CRIME HE'S GOING TO BE INDICTED. Martha: HAS RUDY GIULIANI GIVEN YOU THAT KIND OF ASSURANCE GIVEN YOU THAT KIND OF ASSURANC ASSURANCE? SORT OF OFF-LINE ON ALL OF THIS BECAUSE WHEN HE MAKES THE STATEMENTS, THE REPORTS ARE THAT HE'S GETTING AHEAD OF HIMSELF, THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE SAYING THERE'S NO INDICTMENT WHEN THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE ISSUE IS STILL OUT THERE. DO YOU THINK THAT HE IS SORT OF ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND THE REST OF THE TEAM WHEN HE COMES OUT AND SAYS THERE WILL BE NO INDICTMENT? I THINK THE MAYOR IS EXACTLY ON THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM. IT IS A DIFFERENT TACTIC, WHICH IS A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE TACTIC AS IT RELATES TO DEALING WITH THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. TOMORROW MARKS THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF BOB MUELLER BEING NAMED AS THE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE THIS AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WASTED, NO COLLUSION BY THE PRESIDENT. WE KNOW THAT NO COLLUSION BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE MAYOR HAS NOW SAID IF BOB MUELLER WANTS TO TALK TO THE PRESIDENT YOU DO IT THROUGH A SERIES OF QUESTIONS IN A VERY LIMITED FASHION. THAT'S A VERY REASONABLE REQUEST AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE MUELLER TEAM HAS ANY INTEREST IN DOING THAT. Martha: LET'S PLAY THIS SOUND BITE FROM THE INTERVIEW THAT LAURA INGRAHAM DID WITH RUDY GIULIANI AND GET YOUR QUICK THOUGHTS FROM THAT BEFORE WE HEAD TO THE BREAK. WHAT IS YOUR OPTIMAL TIMELINE FOR THIS TO WRAP UP? TODAY. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I THINK THAT THEY HAVE THE FACTS FROM WHICH THEY CAN WRITE THE REPORT. GOING TO WRITE A FAIR REPORT, FINE. GOING TO FIND WRITE AN UNFI GOING TO FIND WRITE AN UNFR GOING TO FIND WRITE AN UNFP GOING TO FIND WRITE AN UNFR GOING TO FIND WRITE AN UNF, WRITE IT AND WE WILL COMBAT IT. WE ARE READY TO RIP IT APART. Martha: THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER ATTORNEYS SAID THEY FELT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO WRAP UP VERY QUICKLY. THEY ARE NO LONGER IN THE PICTURE. ONE OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT THAT IS THEY ARE NOT GIVING THE PRESIDENT SORT OF THE FULL PICTURE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THIS INVESTIGATION. DO YOU THINK THAT RUDY GIULIANI IS CORRECT, THAT THIS IS WRAPPING UP, SHOULD WRAP UP AND WILL WRAP UP QUICKLY? I HOPE IT WRAPS UP VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE THE GOAL HERE OF THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS TO WRITE A REPORT TO CONGRESS TO SHOW IF THERE WAS ANY COLLUSION OR COOPERATION OR COORDINATION, WHICH THERE WASN'T. THAT REPORT IS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IF ANY POLITICALIZATION OF THIS ANY FURTHER. WE WE THE MUELLER TEAM TO WRITE THERE PURPORTS TO CONGRESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN SEE VERY CLEARLY THAT THE FROM CAMPAIGN, OF WHICH I WAS A PART OF FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, NEVER COORDINATED WITH ANY RUSSIANS, THERE WEREN'T ANY RUSSIANS THERE, THERE WAS NO COLLUSION AND THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO SEE SO I THINK
