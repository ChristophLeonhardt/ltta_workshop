DEMANDS FOR DENUCLEARIZATION.

DRILLS WITH SOUTH KOREA.

11
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:28,385
WHY THE CHANGE OF HEART AFTER

12
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:30,187

WHY DO YOU THINK THE SUDDEN

16
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:40,631
CHANGE OF HEART OR IS IT A

17
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:41,098
CHANGE OF HEART?

18
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:41,832
>> NEVER HAVE ANYONE ON THE SHOW

19
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:43,167
WHO TELLS YOU WHAT THE NORTH

20
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:48,105
KOREANS ARE THINKING.

21
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:48,839
WE SHOULD NEVER PRESUME TO KNOW.

22
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:53,210
WE SEE A PATTERN OF NORTH KOREAN

23
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,449
BEHAVIOR WHERE WE ARE THE ANGRY

24
00:00:58,449 --> 00:00:59,183
GUY PAYING ATTENTION AND IN SOME

25
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:03,988
WAYS THIS THE SAME OLD SAME OLD.

26
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:04,721
GOING INTO THE TALKS, THEY HAD A

27
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:05,456
SENSE THAT MOMENT WAS TOO STRONG

28
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:06,957
ON THE US SIDE AND WENT TO DO

29
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:07,324
SOMETHING.

30
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:10,928
>> THERE HAS TO BE A REASON

31
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:11,295
BEHIND IT.

32
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:12,563
LET'S LOOK AT THE STATEMENT

33
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:14,598
THREATENING TO CANCEL THE

34
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:21,338
SUMMIT, THE UNITED STATES WILL

35
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:21,939
-- THIS IS A DIFFERENT

36
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:22,306
SOUNDBITE.

37
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:23,140
OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

38
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,008
TAKES AN APPROACH TO THE SUMMIT

39
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:27,645
WITH SINCERITY FOR IMPROVED

40
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:28,312
RELATIONS IT WILL RECEIVE A

41
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:29,046
DESERVED RESPONSE BUT IF THE US

42
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:31,549
IS TRYING TO DRIVE US INTO A

43
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,385
CORNER TO FORCE NUCLEAR

44
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:39,023
ABANDONMENT WE WILL NO LONGER BE

45
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:39,423
INTERESTED.

46
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:40,124
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE WORDS

47
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:40,591
THEY ARE USING?

48
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:42,226
THE PROVOCATIVE MILITARY DRILL,

49
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:42,927
THIS IS SOMETHING THE UNITED

50
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:49,667
STATES HAS BEEN DOING A LONG

51
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:50,234
TIME WITH SOUTH KOREA.

52
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:50,968
>> THE NORTH KOREANS WHEN THEY

53
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:54,071
WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT. THE

54
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:56,774
END TO THESE THINGS AND WHEN THE

55
00:01:56,774 --> 00:01:58,709
NORTH KOREANS SAY WHATEVER, WE

56
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:06,584
DON'T CARE.

57
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,284
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

58
00:02:07,284 --> 00:02:08,018
DRILLS, THE NORTH KOREANS KNOW

59
00:02:08,018 --> 00:02:08,752
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

60
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:09,853
WITH THE DRILLS BUT WHAT I FOUND

61
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:10,454
INTERESTING ABOUT THAT

62
00:02:10,454 --> 00:02:13,591
STATEMENT, IF THE US COMES TO

63
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:18,395
THE TABLE, WE DON'T WANT TO DO A

64
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:19,063
DEAL BUT THE US SENT STRONG

65
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:19,697
SIGNALS THE UNITED STATES

66
00:02:19,697 --> 00:02:23,167
ADMINISTRATION COMING TO A DEAL.

67
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:26,437
WE HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER, IT

68
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,037
IS NOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

69
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:33,277
YOU CAN HAVE WHAT YOU WANT.

70
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,011
YOU NEED TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF

71
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:37,581
THIS DEAL BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T

72
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:38,282
YOU WON'T HONOR IT BUT I WILL

73
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:43,153
GET OUT OF THE DEAL WHAT I NEED

74
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:43,787
AND THAT IS THE WAY THE

75
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:47,157
PRESIDENT WILL NEGOTIATE THIS.

76
00:02:47,157 --> 00:02:50,027
>> THE STATEMENT, THE UNITED

77
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:53,097
STATES WILL UNDERTAKE CAREFUL

78
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:55,165
DELIBERATIONS ABOUT THE FATE OF

79
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:57,635
THE SUMMIT IN LIGHT OF THIS

80
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,237
PROVOCATIVE MILITARY RUCKUS

81
00:03:00,237 --> 00:03:06,844
CONDUCTED WITH SOUTH KOREAN

82
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:07,578
AUTHORITIES AND YOU WERE TALKING

83
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:07,978
ABOUT THAT.

84
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:08,712
>> NORTH KOREANS WALK AWAY FROM

85
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:13,384
THE TALK, WHO CARES?

86
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:13,984
OUR STRATEGY IS MAXIMUM

87
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:14,652
DETERRENCE WHICH IS NUCLEAR

88
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,955
DETERRENCE, MISSILE-DEFENSE,

89
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:18,689
SANCTIONING AND KEEPING THAT IN

90
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:26,930
PLACE AS LONG AS NORTH KOREA'S

91
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,665
NUCLEAR THREAT DOESN'T GIVE THEM

92
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,165
ANY RUNNING ROOM.

93
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:28,899
IF WE KEEP THE STRATEGY IN PLACE

94
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:29,633
THEY CAN DO THAT ALL THEY ONCE.

95
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:30,401
>> CHINA COMES INTO PLAY WITH

96
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:34,405
THIS AND CERTAIN TALKS IN TERMS

97
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:35,172
OF TRADE WITH CHINA.

98
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:40,010
IS THIS ANY LEVERAGE CHINA CAN

99
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,277
USE?

100
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:44,415
>> I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION

101
00:03:44,415 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN'T GET INTO A BOX, MANAGER
