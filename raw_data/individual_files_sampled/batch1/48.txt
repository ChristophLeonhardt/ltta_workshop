this Israeli soldier has in his sights a Palestinian apparently unarmed standing a few meters beyond the separation fence that divides Israel from Gaza just by being there this man is according to Israel's military regulations a legitimate target for a sniper the Army imposes a minimum 100 meter buffer zone into Garza's territory it's a regulation with no backing in international law the video seems to have been shared on social media by one of the soldiers we don't know who the victim is or what he was doing in the time before he was shot Israel's military says it happened in December the delight the snipers colleagues taken hitting their target doesn't change the fact that the Israeli military won't consider the snipers actions unlawful that's according to one human rights group here hearing that anybody who is coming close to the defense will be shooted and anybody who is participating in those demonstrations is part of the Hamas and they want to destroy Israel everybody's a terrorist or their demonstrations are totally illegitimate so if the public debate here that is being conducted by the and being led by the political level is on that level that showing the Palestinian is not deserving the same rights as any other person it's not surprising that this is the result in a statement Israel's military says the video depicts a short part of the response to a violent riot which included rock hurling and attempts to sabotage the security fence and lasted about two hours during the riot means we're taken in order to disperse it including verbal warnings and calls to halt using riot dispersal means and firing warning shots into the air after none of these were successful a single bullet was fired towards one of the Palestinians who is suspected of organizing and leading this incident while he was a few metres from the fence he was hit in the leg and injured a non-target shot that my turn a sniper high-fives from his buddies has of course devastating real-life consequences in the last two weeks in Gaza more than 1400 people have been injured by live fire from Israeli snipers many will be crippled for life 31 people have died Burnett Smith al jazeera West Jerusalem
