NEW REPORTS INDICATE THAT A
LOCATION SCOUT FOR THE NETFLIX
SERIES NARCOS WAS TRAGICALLY
MURDERED WHILE HE WAS IN MEXICO.
HE WAS SCOUTING SPECIFICALLY FOR
THE FOURTH SEASON OF NARCOS
AND HIS BULLET RIDDLED BODY WAS
FOUND IN AN AREA OF MEXICO
THAT'S KNOWN FOR CARTEL
VIOLENCE.
THIS IS CARLOS MUNOZ PORTAL.
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THE
PRODUCERS OF NARCOS PLAN ON
CONTINUING WITH THE MEXICO FOCUSED
SEASON FOUR PLANS, BUT THIS IS AN
INCREDIBLY TRAGIC STORY.
MY HEART GOES OUT TO HIM AND HIS
FAMILY.
IT IS SO WEIRD HOW THE POWER
OF THE CARTELS EXTENDS ñ
FIRST OF ALL, MEXICO AS YOU
KNOW, THESE FORMERLY
BEAUTIFUL TOURIST AREAS, IíM
THINKING ACAPULCO THAT
THEY SAY SORT OF THE RIVIERA OF
LATIN AMERICA, IT HAS A
REPUTATION OF BEING A PLACE
PEOPLE GO FOR HONEYMOON.
YOU CANíT EVEN GO THERE OFTEN
TIMES.
I'M READING ABOUT MORE AND MORE
VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS.
MORE TO THE POINT HERE, THE IDEA
THAT THE CARTELS COULD BE
SO ATTUNED TO THE MEDIA THEY'RE
GETTING TO THE POINT WERE
THEY WOULD WANT TO MURDER THIS
GUY.
THIS IS A LOCATION MANAGER.
HE'S NOT SOME HIGH-END PRODUCER
WHO IS THE CREATOR OF THE
SHOW, HE'S REALLY SORT OF A FOOT
SOLDIER AND IT DOES SEND A
MESSAGE.
IT'S A FRIGHTENING MESSAGE AND
IT'S A FRIGHTENING SCENARIO
THAT'S BEING PLAYED OUT IN THIS
COUNTRY AND IT'S BY THE WAY
REFLECTIVE AS I SAY OF WHAT'S
GOING ON THROUGHOUT MEXICO
IN RELATION TO THE CARTELS.
EXACTLY.
RIGHT NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, THERE
AREN'T ANY WITNESSES.
THE AUTHORITIES HAVE VERY FEW
LEADS IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT
JUSTICE FOR HIM, BUT WHAT'S
AMAZING TO ME IS THAT THEY
WENT TO A CRIME RIDDEN PART OF
MEXICO IN ORDER TO CONSIDER
FILMING THERE.
DON'T DO THAT.
THERE IS SOME SUSPICION THAT
CARTELS MIGHT HAVE TARGETED
HIM BECAUSE THEY SAW HIM WITH A
CAMERA AND SO THEY MIGHT OF
THOUGHT, OKAY, HE MIGHT BE
TRYING TO FIND INFORMATION
ON US.
HE MIGHT TRY TO REPORT AS TO
AUTHORITIES.
WHO KNOWS.
SO IT'S SUSPECTED OR AT LEAST
THEORIZED THAT HE MIGHT NOT
THAT THEY MIGHT NOT OF KNOWN HE
WAS ATTACHED TO THIS PRODUCTION.
RIGHT.
HOW WOULD THEY KNOW?
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THEY
KNEW, BUT IT'S SUCH A
DEVASTATING STORY.
IF ANYTHING, IT SHOULD MAKE
PEOPLE REALIZE THAT WHEN
INDIVIDUALS ARE FLING PARTS OF
MEXICO, THEY ARE NOT DOING
IT TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES
TO START TROUBLE.
IN A LOT OF CASES THEY ARE DOING
IT FOR A COURSE ECONOMIC
REASONS BUT ALSO TO ESCAPE
VIOLENCE AND RIGHT NOW,
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS COMING
IN FROM MEXICO IS AT AN
ALL-TIME LOW, BUT PEOPLE TRYING
TO COME IN FROM PLACES LIKE
EL SALVADOR AND HONDURAS, THAT'S
UP BECAUSE OF CRIME THAT'S
PARTLY FUELED BY OUR WAR ON
DRUGS.
WE HAVE EMPOWERED THESE CARTELS
TO THE POINT WHERE THEY
HAVE BECOME MORE POWERFUL
THAN AUTHORITIES IN THOSE
COUNTRIES AND THEY ARE INNOCENT
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO
FLEE THE VIOLENCE THAT THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR SAFETY AND THEY WANT
TO SAVE THE KIDS FOR MURDER AND
THAT'S THE REASON WHY THEY'RE
TRYING TO GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES
AND AN UNDOCUMENTED FASHION.
WHAT ANNA IS TALKING ABOUT IS
SO TRUE.
THE STREAM OF REFUGEES FROM
VIOLENCE.
THIS IS RAPE AND MURDER GOING ON
IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND THEIR
PASSING THROUGH MEXICO ON THE
WAY HERE AND THEY COME ON TOP
OF THESE TRAINS IF YOU HAVEN'T
GONE ONLINE, YOU CAN SEE IT.
THESE KIDS THAT ARE HUDDLED ON
TOP OF THE TRAIN AS IT GOES
HUNDREDS OF MILES.
YEAH, WHAT'S DRIVING IMMIGRATION
AGAIN, FROM CENTRAL AMERICA
IS NOT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY EVEN
SO MUCH ANYMORE.
THERE IS LESS AND LESS OF THAT
IN THIS COUNTRY AS YOU KNOW
BUT IT'S THE FEAR OF DEATH, THE
FEAR MURDER.
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE
MEXICO NEVER FELT THAT I NEEDED
TO SECURE ITS SOUTHERN BORDER
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY
ARE NOTICING THIS INFLUX OF
REFUGEES ESSENTIALLY FROM
CENTRAL AMERICA POURING IN THEIR
COUNTRY SO THEY ALL OF A SUDDEN
ARE DEALING WITH NOT A SIMILAR
ISSUE, BUT IMMIGRATION
POLICY QUESTIONS THAT THE US HAS
HAD TO FACE.
IT'S ALL PRETTY INTERESTING
STUFF AND AGAIN, MY HEART GOES
OUT TO THIS POOR GUYS FAMILY AND
IT IS OKAY TO SHOOT THE SHOW IN
NEW MEXICO OR ARIZONA OR A PLACE
THAT KIND OF MAYBE YOU CAN
MAKE LIKE MEXICO.
MY FRIEND JUST HAD TO SHOW ALL
ABOUT A ROCK AND A SHOT IN
NEW MEXICO.
NEW MEXICO DOUBLES FOR MY SCHOOL
ALL THE TIME.
THIS IS A KIND OF THING, IF THEY
ARE IN ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT,
WE WENT OUT AN TO SHUT IN MEXICO
AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU, THAT
PLACE IS NO PARTY BUT WE WANTED
TO HAVE A NOT THEN TAKE FIELD.
DON'T RISK PEOPLE'S LIVES.
MOVE THE PRODUCTION TO NEW
MEXICO AND HIRE A BUNCH OF
AUTHENTIC PEOPLE.
THAT IS THE HOLLYWOOD IS.
IT IS CASTING.
