well I'm not so sure what stickety-boo about this except that it makes me laugh uproariously and I think that alone is something that is just incredibly worthwhile stormy Daniels has brought out her memoir and as we might have imagined it is you know of course depressing you know useless I memoir the fact that Donald Trump did what we all could have guessed he did which is slept with the pornstar right but she goes on to these incredible descriptions these graphic descriptions which I have now to my great shame actually read it she describes his junk she describes you know Trump's tower and what she says is that is that he is junk looked like towed from Mario Kart and as a gamer I have to tell you this just broke my heart because I love all the Mario games the Mario games were like some of the first really great games I played I mean I played video games since they were invented so I played them all but Super Mario was one of the greatest and I cannot stand the fact that from now on when I see toad smiling little toad in in Mario Kart I've got to think of Donald Trump's junk but the thing that makes me laugh about this okay is how the fact that the news is covering this the news media is covering this is if this was important here's Jake Tapper like what happened to you Jake hey Jake you had a career you had dignity you were somebody now you're doing this listen to this lots of books claim to be tell-alls but they don't follow through stormy Daniels new book about her life it's not that book Wow she tells all from the details of her career in porn - yes being in bed with the future President of the United States and even being able to pick certain parts of him out of a lineup and then being threatened to shut up about him all these accounts are in there Jake Jake Jake here's the funny thing to me I'm I am old enough to remember when they didn't even report that the president was having an affair you know in the Oval Office at the point I was banging everybody who walked through there I mean like yet he had two aides they called them and faddle that was their names for them who they were skinny-dipping in the White House pooled together and the press knew all this stuff and they just didn't report it and when they first started to report on back in the 80s I would say it was when they first started to report on the sexual shenanigans of powerful people powerful men mostly when they first started to report on that there was this big debate about whether it was relevant important news because it was the character issue and I made fun of this I wrote this novel true crime which became the Clint Eastwood movie and in that he says the character issue is just a way of reporting about sex all we want to do is report about sex why because people want to read about sex because people are salacious and they're judgmental and they're gossipy and they want to talk about sex so they will turn sex on so while they were sitting there with their serious faces just like today they're sitting there with Brett Kavanaugh with their serious faces when it's all about politics when they were talking about the the character issue back in the 80s they were really just talking about sex that's all they wanted to do so now we have moved on and now we have the horrible concept suck and read forever like I used to you know i-i've been walking around for days going like beep beep beep beep beep beep beep singing their theme song because this thing is stuck in my head and now forever we have it stuck on our head that Donald Trump is walking around with toadstool Oh Mary card it pants and that's the character issue that's the seriousness the serious character issue
