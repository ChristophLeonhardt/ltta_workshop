these tents you see here meant to hold the children Trump has separated from their fathers and mothers stand as today's American reality not a welcome mat but a mat to lie on Trump put up these tents President John built that what senator Tim Kaine has just christened the new Trump hotels look at them just as one president permanently known for Hoovervilles look at those shacks these shacks cities for victims of the Great Depression this presidents today the proprietary the proprietor of the new Trump Ville packed with the kids we've torn from their parents good evening I'm Chris Maddy's dad in Washington President Trump his administration have been overwhelmed by the growing public outcry of the new tent cities and the zero tolerance policy behind them the president's left the Capitol tonight after meeting with congressional House Republicans to try and figure out some way out of this crisis that he has manufactured the Atlantic is reported on the issue of family separations the president said quote this is a dangerous issue the images are bad for us well the reporter added to the conference on immigration policy included very little talk of actual immigration unable to stem the tide of criticism many of trumps aides have now embarked on an aggressive PR campaign to blame the Congress but the president has the power to fix this in the sunset we're only simply enforcing the law situation we have me to put a pause on if Congress gave us actually the tools to adjudicate it does President Donald Trump really want to make the argument that the buck does not stop with him well no the buck stops with the people who make the laws in this country well the president seems to find an unrepentant amid the overwhelming backlash punched back early today deviating from prepared remarks the president delivered a campaign style speech people that come in violate the law they endanger their children in the process and frankly they endanger all of our children when you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally which should happen you have to take the children away according to the Washington Post now the Presidency's immigration is a winning issue politically a winning issue complaining repeatedly in recent months that he looks weak on border enforcement and has been concerned that his base could turn on him for not being tougher West Wing sources now tell Axios that President ROM quote has shown little indication that he'll climb down from the zero-tolerance border policy well the conserved editorial board of the Wall Street Journal warned however that this type of self-destructive politics has been a study in confusion it adds that if mr. Trump wants to lose the house and risk impeachment he'll take mr. Benin's bad advice and keep giving Democrats that daily picture of children stripped from their parents for more I'm John buddy join Ainslie national security and justice reporter for NBC news and jonathan swan national political reporter for Axios jonathan you're sitting right here I want to ask you is the president going to switch or is he gonna fight is he gonna keep up this fight or climb down from that wall that's the question I've been asking West Wing officials all week I have got no evidence that he is ready to flip this policy to make a unilateral really unilateral action to flip this policy but he's definitely feeling the pressure he's definitely feeling the pressure and that House Conference meeting that he just attended you know that Elena plot from the Atlantic reported on he made clear in that meeting that the images are bad and that this is a bad issue and it needs to be fixed the real question is is he going to do it unilaterally is he gonna tell jeff sessions to flip the policy that would be a major climb down would see that as a huge loss and then that kid in the red though I think is going to grab a lot of hearts that's kind of been looking at pictures of him there's another one these young kids let me go to Joey in this you know it's a standing situation for the first lady the United States seems that's the picture seems to be challenging the president what gives and Rosalyn Carter as well and Laura Bush and all these I get this night that they're speaking more for the country that Trump is my hunch well it's interesting that they that it's first ladies who are coming out right they're supposed to be showing the sympathetic side of America's moral character and this is something that a lot of people think is in jeopardy right now as the Trump administration pursues this but apparently and as Jonathan points out that hasn't quite gotten through to president at least not to the point that he wants to change this policy and instead what this administration has done as they have doubled down on talking points we had another press call today with all of the reporters covering this and DHS and the Health and Human Services and they keep just trying to tell us that if we could just report this story accurately everyone would understand it from their side they'd be sympathetic toward the government but the fact of the matter is Chris a lot of the pictures that are being shown are actually provided to journalists from the government they're not letting us into a lot of these facilities and so we're going on their pictures so for the President to say we're cherry-picking for secretary Neilson to say that we are reporting faults and news and that these children are just being treated absolutely wonderfully that is inaccurate we are reporting a lot of what they are giving us here well let's look at this throughout the campaign Donald Trump candidate Trump vowed to create deportation forces to help cut down on illegal immigration let's watch what he said in the campaign you're going to have a deportation force and you're going to do it you mainly we are going to triple the number of ice deportation officers we take anybody come on in anybody just come on in not anymore remember under a trump administration it's called America first to choose immigrants based on merit merit skill and proficiency doesn't that sound nice our message to the world will be this you cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country okay let's get down to the reality these are asylum seekers they're not people poor people from Mexico they're generally coming from Latin America from Horrible's governments Dennett Hallberg countries right at this point in terms of violence they've come asking for something isn't there wait I hate to be suggest you actually can't get on this why don't we have faster processing why are people judged where they have a right to a sign we're not in a faster way so they don't run up against these twenty David limits well there were proposals to try and remedy that I don't know whether they would be effective or not obviously there's also a question of resources issues like that but this is again this is a very clear policy decision to enforce the law for every single person who comes across the border illegally which is itself sucks up a whole lot of resources and again is itself very clearly an administrative decision despite what the administration earlier when they come across I think they can establish what country they're coming from it if they come from Latin American Central American countries which have had these horrible situations and violence situations down there they should be in a different category than just the person just getting across the border from Mexico whose poor and wants a better life here they are in that particular category of asylum seekers why are they putting them in jail well at this point just because you are have been persecuted have been hurt from a gang or domestic violence under the Attorney General's new standards that doesn't qualify you for asylum and to the president's point about crossing illegally it doesn't matter if you're claiming asylum if you are crossing what he would say is illegally and that means between the ports of entry but what's really interesting about all that is that when he talks about surging resources and tripling the number of enforcement officers from ice he doesn't mention sending more Asylum officers we don't know what happened to the surge and judges he wanted to bring which would increase that press as you just laid out Chris instead he wants to enforce the tough parts of this system and he wants to make it so that it is so hard to come through legally and claim asylum through the ports of entry they were seeing immigrants be turned away well it's getting hotter and hotter decision it's not going away
