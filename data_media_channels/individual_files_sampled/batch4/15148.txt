all right today was the day well it wasn't that day it was a day but that day is coming up in November which is midterms now I am currently in beautiful Nashville Tennessee I was here representing another organization that I work with because President Trump was in town and he was here supporting someone who has supported him since day one Marsha Blackburn who is a congresswoman here in Tennessee and she is running for Senate she is running for the spot that bob Corker is vacating so this is a seat that I'm not too sad to see bob Corker leave but i would be really really really happy to see marsha blackburn take this seat she is opposing Phil Bredesen who is a longtime politician here in the state of Tennessee he is a two-term mayor two-term governor he's really really well known in the state leading up to this past week Bredesen was ahead in the polls but marsha has pulled up to meet him there pretty much neck-and-neck right now and I'm sure they will be leading all the way up to the midterms of course we can't trust Bowles because we saw what happened in 2016 but I just want to go through some of the things that President Trump talked about at his rally now I did not make it to the rally because I wasn't able to get there in time because President Trump came to the Opryland Hotel where we had a very small and intimate reception with him where he spoke to all of us and gave us kind of a condensed version of the speech that he gave at his rally and by the time we had to wait for the presidential motorcade and Secret Service and everyone to leave the hotel we drove back to the auditorium in Nashville for the rally and we weren't able to get there in time but just to talk about some of the things this was a long speech by President Trump and he went off script a lot he wasn't actually on script at all for the the kind of private reception that we had with him which is the best because that is it is when Trump is his trumpet and it's the best because you can see that he is speaking from his heart and he has that bombastic personality that is so Donald Trump so one of the things he talked about in his rally speech he talked about the embassy that we are moving to Jerusalem its rightful home in Israel he talked about the negotiating the thing that he is so good at with the art of the deal and his deal making skills and his talent to negotiate with people and bring prices down they had originally quoted him at a million dollars to build this embassy in Jerusalem and so he calls up his diplomatic buddies in Jerusalem and he's like I don't think that's gonna work for me so they said all right we can feasibly do it for about $150,000 and he said you know what I'm a generous guy let's make it an even $400,000 so he saved American taxpayers six hundred thousand dollars over 50 percent of the original price tag that's something that Trump does because he knows how hard taxes have hit has hit us during the last administration so that's something that he cares about he talked about bredesen so what a lot of people don't know about bredesen and actually I don't know if he talked about this but I'm gonna tell you Phil Bredesen the man who's running against Marsha Blackburn for bob Corker seat he talks about how he's willing to work with the president and he wants to to do things to improve America he's all for this America first agenda but what he won't tell you is that he spent four hundred and sixty thousand dollars in donations to people like Barack Obama Hillary Clinton and Al Gore this guy is as deep and as far left as you can imagine do not be fooled by his ads those of you in Nashville I see you I'm gonna wash you what else did he talk about ya bredesen which sought out by Schumer actually for this seat because the Democrats did their research and they knew that this was a vulnerable seat and they thought that they could plug it up with another Democrat because even though we have had the majority since last term or since the last election we haven't really been able to use it to the best of our ability and this will help us we've got to get more people more Republicans in those seats he did not talk about the Muller investigation which I kind of missed because it's kind of one of his rallying points and he didn't talk about this recent recent rosanna scandal maybe it's not on his radar I mean he was in motorcades and on Air Force One and going to all over holy creation today so he might not have heard about the news will probably hear it in his tweets tomorrow but everybody have a great day night what is that I can't tell I'm so jet-lagged I'm heading back to LA 6:00 in the morning tomorrow so everybody wish me luck thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if
