the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the book is actually three parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the book the first part of the book is</font>

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,730
kind of a history<font color="#CCCCCC"> and overview of</font>

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube where came from how it grew the</font>

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,989
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is basically like a guide</font>

23
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,960
for anybody who<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube how</font>

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,750
they can get started either you know by

25
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,450
just browsing videos by actually making

26
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,790
and uploading videos and then of course

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">the third part is how you can use</font>

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,750
YouTube to launch<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own career I</font>

29
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,600
interviewed what I thought were some of

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25 most interesting people on</font>

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,619
YouTube and talk to them but yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

32
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,509
being one of them talk to them about

33
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,119
about their stories and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they got</font>

34
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,310
started and and how they were able to

35
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">find success by using the same making</font>

36
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">videos right um since like we discussed</font>

37
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Olly was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that says 15 minutes</font>

38
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,340
of fame isn't misleading that that's all

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,860
you get but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 minutes is like</font>

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,799
the pivotal point in which you then sort

41
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">of go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there into the real world</font>

42
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,159
exactly I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of it as as you</font>

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,899
know YouTube will give you your first 15

44
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,490
minutes you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> which to launch</font>

45
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,149
you know further success not not your

46
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,719
only 15 minutes but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess you know it</font>

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,610
all depends what you do with the success

48
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and and how you can appoint it on to</font>

49
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,480
the next level

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">school and the reason I am promoting</font>

51
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,760
this I'm not getting paid I was given a

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,650
free copy but that was expected anybody

53
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,040
did buy you dinner<font color="#E5E5E5"> tonight all you want</font>

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,860
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this year um but he was gay</font>

55
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,900
agreed to do the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I did I</font>

56
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,610
did um but the reason is i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

57
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Frederick is more in the industry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

58
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,959
obviously in the real world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

59
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,299
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sighing I've come to terms with in</font>

60
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:41,730
the past year is<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube is a platform</font>

61
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,129
that then takes you out there I mean

62
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:45,450
there are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who vlog on</font>

63
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,280
youtube and that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they</font>

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,140
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make anything of it but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

65
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,940
do have to sort of use those what you've

66
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">learnt from it and take it out there if</font>

67
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,910
you do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sight of your life</font>

68
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think because of that connection</font>

69
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,769
it really interests me and with it being

70
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,660
a good read and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people spoke to</font>

71
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,000
who've got it already I said it's a good

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,400

83
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,130
something I've been asking this and it

84
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,569
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Drake that was</font>

85
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,760

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,280
what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you over dinner tonight and</font>

91
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,230
I'll repeat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> story is you know I</font>

92
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,639
spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> about three months before i</font>

93
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,379
actually started writing the book just

94
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,359
surfing the net looking at different

95
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,030
videos and different channels on<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube</font>

96
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,230
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find who I thought were some</font>

97
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,790
of the most interesting and most

98
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,180
engaging personalities on the net you

99
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,010
know some people I found you know were

100
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,139
just extremely talented musicians and

101
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,359
some were hilarious comedians and then

102
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:16,089
and then there was you I was it

103
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,918
you had no you have have you had doesn't

104
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,418

105
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,279
personality you were you're very

what you had to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you were</font>

109
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,419
you were approachable and I think that's

110
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,970
you know part of your charm is that

111
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,800
people come across your videos and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

112
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,210
