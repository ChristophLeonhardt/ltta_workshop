>> Shannon: IN A LETTER
ADDRESSED HER FRIENDS AND FELLOW
AMERICANS, THE FIRST FEMALE
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SANDRA DAY
O'CONNOR REVEALS SHE'S IN THE
EARLY STAGES OF DEMENTIA AND
WILL BE WITHDRAWING FROM PUBLIC
LIFE.
IN THE WAKE OF INCREASINGLY
UNCIVIL POLITICAL RHETORIC, THE
FURY OVER THE NEW U.S.
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NOT YET
DYING DOWN.
O'CONNOR SAYS CALLING HER WORK
IN CIVICS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.
"WE MUST REACH OUR YOUTH.
IT'S TIME TO MAKE CIVIC LEARNING
AND ENGAGEMENT A REALITY FOR
ALL."
RETIRED JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S SON
JAY O'CONNOR IS HERE WITH MORE
ON HIS MOTHER'S LEGACY.
WELCOME.
CAN YOU TELL US HOW SHE'S DOING,
HOW YOU ARE ALL DOING.
THIS IS A VERY BRAVE LETTER AND
I'M SURE NOT AN EASY ONE FOR HER
TO WRITE.
>> WELL, THIS IS A BIG MOMENT
FOR MY MOM TO BE OPEN ABOUT WHAT
HER CONDITION IS.
THERE HAD BEEN A LOT OF
INQUIRIES, PEOPLE WOULD NOTICED
SHE WAS LESS ACTIVE IN PUBLIC
LIFE.
SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST TO
BE DIRECTED PEOPLE AND SHARE
WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HER
MEDICAL CONDITION.
WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THE
TRANSITION IN HER LIFE.
>> Shannon: I WANT TO READ
SOME OF THE COMMENTS WE GOT FROM
SOME OF THE CURRENT JUSTICES.
JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN SANG
"SHATTERING GLASS CEILING AFTER
GLASS CEILING, SHE SHOWED HOW
WOMEN COULD TAKE PART AS
EQUALS."
RUTH BADER GINSBURG SAYING "SHE
STRIVE MIGHTILY TO MAKE A
MOMENTOUS MOMENT FOR WOMEN IN
1981 NO LONGER EXTRAORDINARY BUT
ENTIRELY EXPECTABLE.
I AM AMONG LEGIONS OF WOMEN
ENDEAVORING TO FOLLOW HER LEAD."
THE OTHER FEMALE, JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR EQUALLY A GLOWING
STATEMENT FROM HER BUT SHE
DOCKED ABOUT HOW THE FACT THAT
SHE'S ON THE BOARD OF CIVICS, A
GROUP YOUR MOTHER STARTED.
TO MAKE SURE ALL OF US HAVE A
BETTER EDUCATION ABOUT HOW OUR
COUNTRY WORKS AND RUNS ON WHY
IT'S IMPORTANT WE WOULD ACTUALLY
UNDERSTAND IT.
>> YES.
MY MOTHER WAS VERY CONCERNED
AFTER RETIRING FROM THE COURT
ABOUT THE STATE OF CIVIC
KNOWLEDGE THAT MOST AMERICANS
FACE.
AND UNDERSTAND.
LITERALLY ONE-THIRD OF AMERICANS
CAN ACTUALLY NAME ALL THREE
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.
SHE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
IT.
AT AGE 79, SHE STARTED AN
EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE COMPANY
THAT'S ALL ABOUT TEACHING OF
CIVICS IN AN EXCITING WAY FOR
YOUNG PEOPLE, USING INTERACTIVE
GAMES.
MAKES LEARNING AND CIVIC
ENGAGEMENT FUND AND RELEVANT.
STARTING FROM SCRATCH, IT
REACHES ALL THE SCHOOLKIDS IN
THE COUNTRY FROM GRADES FIVE
THROUGH 12.
A REMARKABLE SOLUTION.
>> Shannon: FANTASTIC LEGACY
IN ADDITION TO ALL THE WORK SHE
DID ON THE COURTS.
WE CHECKED INTO THE NUMBERS.
ANNENBERG DOES THIS EVERY YEAR.
37% OF AMERICANS THEY SURVEYED
COULDN'T NAME ANY OF THE RIGHTS
GUARANTEED UNDER THE
FIRST AMENDMENT.
THIS ISN'T SOME OBSCURE
AMENDMENT.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE
FIRST AMENDMENT.
26% CAN NAME ALL THREE BRANCHES
OF GOVERNMENT.
AS A FELLOW AMERICAN, I FIND
THAT TERRIFYING.
>> ABSOLUTELY, AND SO DID MY MOM
AND THAT'S WHY SHE WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
THERE IS A GREAT SOLUTION AT
HAND.
SHE SAID IN HER LETTER TODAY, IN
ADDITION TO SHARING THE NEWS
ABOUT HER MEDICAL CONDITION, SHE
WANTED TO USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
UNDERLINE HOW IMPORTANT SHE
FEELS IT IS FOR OUR COUNTRY TO
ADDRESS THE ISSUE.
IT CAN'T BE SOLVED, AND HOW CAN
WE EFFECTIVELY GOVERN OUR
COUNTRY AND HOW CAN OUR CITIZENS
CHOOSE THE RIGHT REPRESENTATIVES
UNLESS I HAVE A BASIC
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR COUNTRY
WORK, HOW THE GOVERNMENT WORKS
AND HOW THE CONSTITUTION IS
DESIGNED AND SOME OTHER FOUNDING
PRINCIPLES OF THE COUNTRY.
BY SHARING THE COMMON
UNDERSTANDING AND THOSE,
FOUNDATIONS, IT CAN ALLOW US ALL
TO WORK MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY
AND PRODUCTIVELY.
>> Shannon: DO YOU WORRY SOME
OF THIS MISINFORMATION DOES LEAD
TO SOME OF THE RHETORIC AND THE
SNIPING AND THE HEATED
PARTISANSHIP AND BACK-AND-FORTH
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT
FROM THOSE SHARED THINGS ARE
VERY SPECIAL AS AMERICANS.
>> I THINK THAT BY BETTER
APPRECIATING AND UNDERSTANDING
OUR COMMON HERITAGE AND THE
VALUES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT,
WE CAN RE-ENERGIZE AMERICANS TO
REALIZE THAT WE ARE ALL ON THE
SAME TEAM AND WE CAN ALL ACHIEVE
THINGS BY BETTER THINGS WORKING
TOGETHER.
MY MOM STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT
YOU DON'T GET ANYWHERE BY
YELLING AT ONE ANOTHER, AND
THAT'S TRUE OF BOTH SIDES.
>> Shannon: I THOUGHT IT WAS
BEAUTIFUL IN HER LETTER SHE
TALKED ABOUT THE COUNTLESS
BLESSINGS IN HER LIFE AND HOW
FORTUNATE SHE FELT TO BE AN
AMERICAN.
WE ARE FORTUNATE FOR THAT AS
