gone you would but according to Jennifer
you try to author of women without men
single mothers and family change in the
new Russia the role of women as
caretakers and men as protective it not
as idealized as Alesia makes it out to
be
there's a longing for a sober reliable
breadwinner you try to interviewed
hundreds of Russian men and women to
understand family life there well she
found was a reoccurring problem with in
Russian marriages
alcoholism in 2014 a study indicated
that 25% of Russian males died before
the age of 55 largely because of alcohol
as a result you try to noted that women
were being forced to take up the role of
caretaker in home studying families it
is a big problem and it would come up in
terms of just not being able to count on
a partner and among the women she
interviewed the idea that the men in
their lives were unreliable wasn't it
just found an alcohol
unlike the West Russian society never
really embraced feminist ideas that
would encourage men to become more
involved in home life during the Soviet
era women were required to work but they
were also still expected to be
homemakers with establishment of the
Soviet Union equality felt like more of
a slogan because there wasn't a movement
to really involve men in domesticity
childcare housework women really have
this double burden in modern day Russia
there are no laws requiring women to
work but on the Russian president
Putin's Conservative government benefits
that help working women are not as
plentiful as before and according to you
Trotter many women feel like their life
choices are limited I think one of the
main themes I found in researching this
book is that there's a real
disappointment and all the Russian men
and also the idea of the government
doing anything for them like it used to
provide these benefits and free
after-school programs and maternity
leaves they can't rely on that anymore
literally almost every woman said I can
rely on myself alone there were a range
of things that they're open to they
would get support from their girlfriends
and other women that would help them
keep this you know focus I'm relying on
themselves
the idea is self-reliant of being the
person within the marriage who is
holding everything together is one that
is echoed in Elisa's ideology the

Alicia
in 2012 the feminist rock band Pussy
Riot staged an impromptu concert inside
a church singing lyrics that incited men
and women to become feminists they were
arrested but it's thought that their
protest was one that represented a
growing feeling among young Russian
women that they were being treated as
second-class citizens
but inequality surrounding gender role
expectations in Russia may continue to
permeate because despite his policies it
seems there is an appeal in Putin to
some Russian women because he appears
reliable masculine and more sober than
previous leaders and though it may seem
strange to some there are a lot of women
like Alicia who just don't believe in
feminism maranatha chuckles Carla
