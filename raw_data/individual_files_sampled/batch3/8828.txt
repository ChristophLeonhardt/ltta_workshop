THEM ALL HOUR. ALLISON BARBER HAS BEEN DOING THAT AS WELL. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH ALL THESE AT THIS POINT. SO FAR IT'S CLEAR THIS IS THE MOST COMPLETE PICTURE WE HAVE OF THIS MEETING TO DATE. THE PRESIDENT'S SON, DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR BEGAN HIS TESTIMONY BY SAYING I DID NOT COLLUDE WITH ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AND DO NOT KNOW OF ANYONE WHO DID. HE ALSO SAID THE PRESIDENT DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE JUNE 2016 MEETING WITH A RUSSIAN LAWYER. THE BIG ISSUE HERE IS THAT MEETING AND THE SUBSEQUENT EXPLANATIONS OF IT. INITIALLY HE TOLD "THE NEW YORK TIMES" THE MEETING WAS PRIMARILY ABOUT RUSSIAN ADOPTIONS NOT MENTIONING THE FACT HE AGREED TO THE MEETING AFTER BEING TOLD IN AN EMAIL THE PERSON HAD INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HURT HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN. MANY CALLED TRUMP JUNIOR'S STATEMENT MISLEADING AND THEN THERE WERE REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ACTUALLY DICTATED THE STATEMENT. THE COMMITTEE ASKED IF THAT WAS CORRECT TO WHICH TRUMP JUNIOR REPLIED I DON'T KNOW, I NEVER SPOKE TO MY FATHER ABOUT IT. IN HIS TESTIMONY HE TOLD THE COMMITTEE HE AGREED TO THE MEETING AFTER A PUBLICIST NAMED ROB GOLDSTONE TOLD HIM SOMEONE HAD OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION THAT WOULD INCRIMINATE CLINTON, HER DEALINGS WITH RUSSIA AND THE INFORMATION WOULD BE USEFUL TO THE CAMPAIGN.

Heather: DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR NOT THE ONLY PERSON AT THIS MEETING, RIGHT? RIGHT. THESE ARE THE SIX KEY PLAYERS, THREE FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WERE AT THE MEETING, TRUMP JUNIOR, PAUL MANAFORT AND JARED KUSHNER. ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE KUSHNER AND MANAFORT DECLINED TO BE INTERVIEWED IN PERSON BY THE COMMITTEE. THEY SUBMITTED STATEMENTS AS DID THE RUSSIAN LAWYER. THESE PEOPLE WERE INTERVIEWED BY THE COMMITTEE. ANOTHER FAMILIAR NAME YOU'LL SEE IN THE GROUP OF PICTURES IS GLENN SIMPSON. THE FIRM BEHIND THE UNVERIFIED TRUMP DOSSIER. SOURCES SAID SIMPSON MET WITH THE RUSSIAN LAWYER BEFORE AND AFTER THE MEETING. HE SAID HE MET WITH HER THE NIGHT BEFORE BUT DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA THAT SHE WAS GOING TO MEET WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. HE SAID HE WAS STUNNED WHEN HE
