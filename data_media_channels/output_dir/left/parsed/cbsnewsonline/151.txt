THE PRESIDENT HAS ALSO NOW 
TODAY CANCELED THIS 
CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC WHICH WAS 
SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW. 
HE SAID IT WOULD NOT LOOK 
APPROPRIATE TO HOLD THAT AT 
THIS TIME. 
LET'S GO NOW TO THE SIGNING OF 
THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
WE'RE SIGNING AN EXECUTIVE 
ORDER I CONSIDER TO BE A VERY 
IMPORTANT EXECUTIVE ORDER. 
IT'S ABOUT KEEPING FAMILIES 
TOGETHER WHILE AT THE SAME TIME 
BEING SURE THAT WE HAVE A VERY 
POWERFUL VERY STRONG BORDER AND 
BORDER SECURITY WILL BE EQUAL 
IF NOT GREATER THAN PREVIOUSLY, 
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE STRONG, 
VERY STRONG BORDERS, BUT WE'RE 
GOING TO KEEP THE FAMILIES 
TOGETHER. 
I DIDN'T LIKE THE SIGHT OR THE 
FEELING OF FAMILIES BEING 
SEPARATED. 
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT'S GONE ON 
FOR MANY YEARS AS YOU KNOW 
THROUGH MANY ADMINISTRATIONS, 
AND WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD ON 
IMMIGRATION. 
IT'S BEEN LEFT OUT IN THE COLD, 
PEOPLE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH IT, 
AND WE ARE DEALING WITH IT, SO 
STEP BY STEP JUST LIKE WE DEALT 
WITH NORTH KOREA. 
WE DEALT WITH IRAN. 
WE DEALT WITH AN ECONOMY THAT 
WAS HEADING IN THE WRONG 
DIRECTION. 
WE DEALT WITH A LOT OF 
DIFFERENT PROBLEMS. 
THIS IS ONE THAT HAS GONE ON 
FOR MANY DECADES, SO WE'RE 
KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER, AND 
THIS WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. 
AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE KEEPING 
A VERY POWERFUL BORDER, AND IT 
CONTINUES TO BE A ZERO 
TOLERANCE. 
WE HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR 
PEOPLE THAT ENTER OUR COUNTRY 
ILLEGALLY. 
WITH THAT I'D AND MIKE PENCE, 
THE VICE PRESIDENT IF HE'D LIKE 
TO SAY ANYTHING. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S 
MADE CLEAR IS WE BELIEVE IT'S A 
FALSE CHOICE BETWEEN WHETHER WE 
ARE A COUNTRY OF LAW AND ORDER 
OR A COUNTRY WITH BORDERS, AND 
A COUNTRY THAT DEMONSTRATES THE 
COMPASSION AND THE HEART OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND RESPECT FOR 
FAMILIES. 
BY TAKING THIS ACTION, THE 
PRESIDENT WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE 
FOR US TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN 
ENFORCING THE LAW AGAINST 
INDIVIDUALS WHO VIOLATE OUR 
LAW, COME INTO OUR COUNTRY 
ILLEGALLY BUT NOW WE'LL BE ABLE 
IN THAT PROSECUTION IN THE 
IMMEDIATE DAYS FORWARD TO KEEP 
FAMILIES TOGETHER. 
WE ARE CALLING ON CONGRESS TO 
CHANGE THE LAWS IN THIS REGARD 
AND IN A BROAD RANGE OF AREAS 
THAT WILL SECURE OUR BORDERS 
AND GIVE US STRENGTH AND 
CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE ONCE 
AGAIN GOING TO TAKE THE STEPS 
NECESSARY TO END THE CRISIS OF 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN AMERICA. 
>> I THINK THE WORD COMPASSION 
COMES INTO IT, BUT IT'S STILL 
EQUALLY AS TOUGH IF NOT 
TOUGHER, SECRETARY NIELSEN. 
>> I JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
LEADERSHIP, SIR. 
WE LOOK FORWARD AND EXPECT THE 
HOUSE TO ACT THIS WEEK. 
WE ASK THEM TO DO THEIR JOB. 
THE LAWS NEED TO BE CHANGED. 
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT 
PRESIDENT AFTER PRESIDENT HAS 
DEALT WITH FOR DECADES. 
THIS ONE IS WILLING TO STAND UP 
AND FIX IT. 
WE ASK CONGRESS TO DO THEIR 
PART. 
THANK YOU, SIR, FOR YOUR 
LEADERSHIP. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GREAT 
JOB. 
>> OKAY. 
GOING TO HAVE A WILL THE OF 
HAPPY PEOPLE. 
>> THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 
60 YEARS, 60 YEARS. 
NOBODY'S TAKEN CARE OF IT. 
NOBODY'S HAD THE POLITICAL 
COURAGE TO TAKE CARE OF IT, BUT 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF IT. 
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG 
TIME. 
>> CRITICS -- 
>> NO, NO, THE BORDER IS JUST 
AS TOUGH, BUT WE DO WANT TO 
KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER. 
THIS IS A PROBLEM IF YOU LOOK 
AT SOME OF THOSE HORRIBLE 
SCENES FROM A FEW YEARS AGO, TO 
ME THEY WERE HORRIBLE SCENES. 
THEY WERE JUST TERRIBLE, AND 
THAT WAS DURING THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE HAD 
THE SAME THING. 
WE'RE KEEPING THE FAMILY 
TOGETHER AND SO THIS IS IT. 
ALSO THERE MAY BE SOME 
LITIGATION. 
WE'RE ALSO WANTING TO GO 
THROUGH CONGRESS. 
WE WILL BE GOING THROUGH 
CONGRESS. 
WE'RE WORKING ON A MUCH MORE 
COMPREHENSIVE BILL, A LOT OF 
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING 
TOWARD IMMIGRATION, AND PROPER 
IMMIGRATION, WE HAVE TO HAVE 
STRONG BORDERS AND ULTIMATELY 
WE WANT TO SEE IT DONE RIGHT, 
AND IT WILL BE DONE RIGHT. 
WHAT WE HAVE DONE TODAY IS WE 
ARE KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER. 
THE BORDERS ARE JUST AS TOUGH, 
JUST AS STRONG. 
THEY CAN COME IN THROUGH PORTS 
OF ENTRY IF THEY WANT. 
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY. 
THAT'S COMING THROUGH A 
PROCESS. 
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL VERY 
MUCH. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
EVERYBODY. 
WE'LL GET THE WALL DONE. 
WE'LL GET THE WALL DONE. 
YES? 
>> DID IVANKA TRUMP SHOW YOU  
-- 
>> IVANKA FEELS VERY STRONGLY 
ABOUT IT. 
MY WIFE FEELS VERY STRONGLY 
ABOUT IT. 
ANYBODY WITH A HEART WOULD FEEL 
VERY STRONGLY ABOUT IT. 
WE DON'T LIKE TO SEE FAMILIES 
SEPARATED. 
AT THE SAME TIME WE DON'T WANT 
PEOPLE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY 
ILLEGALLY. 
THIS TAKES CARE OF THE PROBLEM. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 
>>  
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU. 
>> YOU'VE JUST WATCHED THE 
PRESIDENT SIGNING THIS 
EXECUTIVE ORDER, WHICH HE SAID 
WILL END THE SEPARATION OF 
FAMILIES. 
HE SAID HE DIDN'T LIKE THE 
SIGHT OF FAMILIES BEING 
SEPARATED BUT THE ZERO 
TOLERANCE POLICY DOES NOT END. 
IT'S JUST AS THESE CRIMINAL 
PROSECUTIONS NOW TAKE PLACE, 
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THE FAMILIES 
WILL STAY TOGETHER. 
WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN MAJOR 
GARRETT NOW WHO'S ALSO AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
SO MAJOR, WHY THE EXECUTIVE 
ORDER, WHY NOT JUST A DIRECTIVE 
TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL? 
WHY NOT -- LEGISLATION LONG-
TERM, WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE 
THINKING HERE? 
>> THE WHITE HOUSE IS 
ESSENTIALLY ASSERTING THAT IT 
MUST FOLLOW THE LAW AND TO 
COUNTER MAN THE LAW IT NEEDS AN 
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROVIDE 
EXECUTIVE INSTRUCTION ALONGSIDE 
WHAT IT SAYS IS THE LAW THAT IT 
IS DUTY BOUND TO ENFORCE, AND 
THAT LAW THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS 
IS DUTY BOUND TO ENFORCE IS 
STOPPING EVERYONE AT THE BORDER 
AND PROSECUTING EACH AND EVERY 
ONE OF THEM FOR THE CRIME OF 
TRYING TO ENTER THE COUNTRY 
ILLEGALLY. 
NOW OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS HAD 
THAT LAW BEFORE THEM AND DID 
NOT UNIVERSALLY APPLY IT. 
THIS ADMINISTRATION STARTING IN 
APRIL OF THIS YEAR UNDER THE SO-
CALLED -- THE ADMINISTRATION 
NAMED IT THIS -- ZERO TOLERANCE 
POLICY, UNIVERSALLY APPLY THAT 
LAW. 
IF YOU'RE CAUGHT AT THE BORDER, 
YOU WILL BE PROSECUTED, AND 
UNDER A CONSENT DECREE, THAT 
WAS A RESULT OF YEARS AND YEARS 
OF LITIGATION, THE PREVIOUS -- 
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 
ESSENTIALLY AGREED TO SEPARATE 
FAMILIES IF THEY WERE BEING 
PROSECUTED FOR CROSSING THE 
BORDER ILLEGALLY BECAUSE 
CHILDREN, IT WAS AGREED, SHOULD 
NOT BE SUBJECTED TO ANY OF THE 
DANGERS OF BEING INCARCERATED 
WITH ADULTS, WHETHER THEY'RE 
PARENTS OR THE ADULTS THEY 
TRAVELED WITH. 
THE ADMINISTRATION KNEW THAT 
WOULD BE THE INEVITABLE RESULT 
OF THIS ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY, 
SEPARATING CHILDREN. 
IT HAD TO KNOW THAT. 
THIS WAS A LONG STANDING 
APPLICATION OR PART OF 
IMMIGRATION POLICY. 
THE ADMINISTRATION WENT AHEAD 
ANYWAY, ENFORCED THE ZERO 
TOLERANCE POLICY, THEN SAW THE 
FAMILY SEPARATION ISSUE 
ESSENTIALLY BLOOM, BLOSSOM AND 
BECOME A HUGE POLITICAL PROBLEM 
NOT ONLY FOR IT BUT MORE 
IMPORTANTLY FOR CONGRESSIONAL 
REPUBLICANS, AND THE COMBINED 
PRESSURE OF REPUBLICAN MEMBERS 
OF THE HOUSE, THE SENATE, FIRST 
LADY MELANIA, DAUGHTER IVANKA 
AND OTHERS LED THE PRESIDENT TO 
ESSENTIALLY OVERRULE HIS OWN 
IMMIGRATION POLICY, AT LEAST IN 
PART. 
ZERO TOLERANCE CONTINUES BUT 
THESE FAMILIES WILL NOW BE KEPT 
TOGETHER. 
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW, JEFF IS 
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FAMILIES 
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
SEPARATED. 
WILL THEY SUDDENLY BE PUT BACK 
TOGETHER. 
WILL THIS BE UNIVERSAL GOING 
FORWARD, AND IT WILL IT BE ABLE 
TO SURVIVE LITIGATION, WHICH 
THOSE WHO HAVE WATCHED THIS 
ISSUE SAY IS ABSOLUTELY 
INEVITABLE. 
WILL CONGRESS USE THIS AS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO SOLVE THIS WITH 
A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THE 
PRESIDENT CAN AND WILL SIGN OR 
WILL THAT LITIGATION OR THE 
SENSE THE PRESIDENT SIGNED AN 
EXECUTIVE ORDER TAKE THE HEAT 
OFF CONGRESS. 
ALL OF THESE ARE UNKNOWN 
ELEMENTS. 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING IS 
ESSENTIALLY OPERATING WITH 
EXECUTIVE POWER TO RESOLVE A 
CRISIS IN LARGE PART OF HIS OWN 
CREATION. 
>> WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE 
TALK ABOUT HOW IMMIGRATION HAS 
BEEN AN ISSUE THAT HAS NEEDED 
SOME ADJUSTMENTS OR FIXING FOR 
DECADES NOW. 
IS THERE -- WHETHER YOU AGREE 
WITH THAT OR NOT IN YOUR 
ESTIMATION IS THERE A FURTHER 
APPETITE ON CAPITOL HILL RIGHT 
NOW FOR SOME SORT OF BROADER 
LEGISLATION? 
>> WELL, THE HOUSE HAS TWO 
BILLS THAT IT BELIEVES IS 
RESPONSIVE TO PART OF THIS 
DILEMMA, ONE THE FAMILY 
SEPARATION ISSUE AS WELL AS 
ANOTHER ATTENDANT IMMIGRATION 
ISSUES. 
THERE'S NO SIGNAL AT ALL, JEFF, 
THAT THE SENATE WILL TAKE UP 
THAT LEGISLATION, IF IT EVEN 
PASSES THIS WEEK. 
THIS IS A, REMEMBER, REPUBLICAN-
LED CONGRESS, REPUBLICAN HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES, REPUBLICAN 
SENATE, THE MARGIN IS NARROW IN 
THE REPUBLICAN LED SENATE, 
THAT'S TRUE AND DEMOCRATS NEED 
TO COME ON BOARD, SOMETHING THE 
WHITE HOUSE HAS POINTED TO MANY 
TIMES, BUT THERE IS NO SENSE, 
AT LEAST PRESENTLY THAT EITHER 
THIS CRISIS OR THE PRESIDENT'S 
OWN POLITICAL PRESSURE HAS 
MOVED CONGRESS ANY CLOSER TO A 
RESOLUTION OF ANY ISSUE UNDER 
THE UMBRELLA OF IMMIGRATION 
EXCEPT MAYBE THIS ONE OF FAMILY 
SEPARATION. 
IT'S POSSIBLE CONGRESS COULD IN 
A BIPARTISAN WAY PASS A PIECE 
OF LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH 
ONLY THAT ISSUE, AND THE 
PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE THE OPTION 
OF SIGNING IT. 
HE SUGGESTED HE VERY WELL 
MIGHT. 
>> BOTTOM LINE THIS AFTERNOON, 
THE PRESIDENT HAS SIGNED THIS 
EXECUTIVE ORDER. 
THE FAMILY SEPARATIONS THAT 
HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE AT THE 
SOUTHERN BORDER WILL END.

STATION ON OUR 24 HOUR
