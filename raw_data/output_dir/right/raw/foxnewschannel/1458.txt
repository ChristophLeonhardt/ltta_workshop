THEY WERE BANNED FROM THE SITE

00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,050
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY

86
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,350
LEMUR.

87
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,819
WAS IT A BABOON?

88
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:24,253
ROLL THE TAPE.

89
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:25,488
>> THERE WAS JUST ONE MONKEY

THE RISI MACOCK WAS CONFINED TO

93
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:32,328
THE AREA AWAY FROM PASSENGERS.

94
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:34,964

WE HAVE A WHOLE PANEL OF JUDGES.

100
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,505
DID THEY JUST DING YOU?

101
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:44,473
>> THEY DINGED ME.

102

COME ON ARM.

104
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:50,813
THIS IS TOUGH.

105
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:54,316
>> Tucker: OUR JUDGES DID JUST

106
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:56,152
SAID DUE TO TECHNICAL

107
00:02:56,152 --> 00:02:57,820

111
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:02,158
THIS MAY BE IT.

112

>> Tucker: WE'RE THE FINAL

113
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:04,894
CALL HERE.

114
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,395
QUESTION THREE, ONE OF THE MOST

00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,731
ROYAL WEDDING WAS A PERFORMANCE

00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,332
BY THE KINGDOM CHOIR.

118
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:12,668
THEY SANG A GOSPEL VERSION OF

119
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:18,340

123
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:26,248
>> Tucker: "STAND BY ME."

124
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:36,192
IS THAT CORRECT?

125
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:38,761
♪ STAND BY ME.

THEY HAD "STAND BY ME."

130
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,370

0-1.

133
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:50,906
YOU'RE COMING BACK.

134
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:53,509
THIS IS MULTIPLE CHOICE, NEW

YORK CITY MAYOR BILL DEBLAZE YO

136
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,480
IS BACKING A PROPOSED BILL THIS

137
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,548
WEEK THAT WOULD BAN WHICH

PLASTIC PRODUCT FROM ALL CITY

139
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:01,117
RESTAURANTS?

140
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:03,419
IS IT A, BOTTLES?

141
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:05,688

IS IT STRAWS?

147
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:15,898
>> ADVOCATES SAY TOO MANY STRAWS

148
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:17,833
END UP IN LANDFILLS AND THE

149
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,233
OCEANS.

ONE OF THE PROPOSED BILL

151
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:21,103
RESTAURANTS AND FAST-FOOD CHAINS

152
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:22,605
WOULD BE BARRED FROM GIVING

153
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:23,005
STRAWS OUT.

154
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,440
>> Tucker: I DON'T KNOW HOW WE

00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:28,577
ROUND IN SUDDEN DEATH TIED 1-1.

157
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:34,950
I TOLD YOU, KRISTINA.

158
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,319
SORT OF THE LAID-BACK POLITENESS

159
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,053
AND PHYSICAL INCAPACITATION.

160
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:40,589
FINAL QUESTION, READY?

STATE, TRIED HER HAND AT PROP

165
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:48,764
COMEDY BY PUTTING ON WHAT KIND

166
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:49,498
OF HAT?

167
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,300
GRIFF JENKINS?

168
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,800
>> A RUSSIAN HAT.

169
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,937
>> Tucker: A RUSSIAN HAT?

170
00:04:54,937 --> 00:04:55,437

THAT, ISN'T IT?

173
00:04:57,773 --> 00:05:00,142
DOES THE TAPE BACK UP GRIFF

174
00:05:00,142 --> 00:05:01,010
JENKINS?

>> A RUSSIAN HAT.

176
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,912
>> Tucker: IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

177
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:03,646
A GREAT JOKE IF SHE DIDN'T SAY

178
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:05,314
ANYTHING AND JUST PUT IT ON HER

179
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:05,614
HEAD!

180
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:07,249
>> I LOVE THE WAY THAT HILLARY

181
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:09,385
IS NOW DOING VISUAL COMEDY.

182
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:10,920
I THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN SHOULD

183
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,491
MAKE CHEAP COMMENTS ON THAT.

184
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:17,660
>> Tucker: JUST ONE OF THOSE

185
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,894
VALUABLE LESSONS ABOUT WORKING

TIME AS YOU KNOW IT.

189
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,504
>> IN THE END, SHE'LL BE

190
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:29,371
REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON HERE.

191
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,906
