folks before I get into the meat and potatoes of my argument I want you to watch the first few seconds of this fantastic rush video subdivisions and you tell me what's the difference between Toronto of 1983 when it was filmed in Toronto today yeah can you believe your eyes folks Toronto some 35 years ago traffic actually moved it wasn't always mired in gridlock has that archival footage shows in any event I'm here on Jarvis Street it's a significant thoroughfare because folks when the late great Mayor Rob Ford was in charge several years ago this was a beachfront in terms of the war on the war of on the car you see the mayor took out the bike lanes of this thoroughfare restoring it to well the cars to have traffic move again he also got rid of the vehicle registration tax things were starting to improve in the City of Toronto in terms of the war on the car but well a few years ago we had regime change and guess what folks the war on the car is now more intense than ever and I'm gonna take you around the city and I'm gonna show you all kinds of battlefields where the war is raging and the motorists are losing once upon a time these trestles they weren't glorified flower pots they supported an elevated expressway this was the eastern leg of the Gardiner Expressway but you know the progressives and the lefties they hate elevated expressways they consider them to be eye sores so years ago they demolish this but you know what this kind of looks good in a post-apocalyptic kind of way don't you think well folks another battleground in terms of the war on the car I'm standing in front of Union Station the busiest train station in Canada and for years riah was under construction they were refurbishing and redeveloping it and a couple years ago it finally reopened and look what we got we've got a reduced front street it's just one lane each way so that's why you have this conga line there's virtually no parking that the shoulders are for taxi stands and it's very limited and look where I'm standing this is what could be an area to park in or an area or a lane of traffic and instead it's they put flower planters yeah I mean pick up roses growing here right you know because you know we really don't need anywhere to pull over and drop off passengers to the busiest train station in Canada do we we'd rather put pretty little flowers up unbelievable okay I'm just around the corner from the Union Station traffic disaster I'm on York Street and what did the city decide to do after although the flower pot idiocy well they doubled down on stupid they took out another lane of traffic as far as the eye can see planters filled with flowers taking out a lane of York Street north remember the song I beg your pardon I didn't promise you a rose garden Oh see this rod was promising rose gardens galore folks and that's why you're stuck in traffic okay folks here is another example of the war on the car it's this this monstrosity called a streetcar it should be underground it should be a subway but we'd like to put them above ground and you see it obliterates two lanes of traffic the left lane that it travels in and as you can see when it loads the passengers cars can't come along the right lane because if they did so the passengers would become roadkill and every couple of summers they'd have to rip up the asphalt and replace the tracks I don't know why but again a nineteenth-century transit solution for a cosmopolitan metropolis in the 21st century why well because they hate the car Oh folks we end our segment on the on the car where the warm the car essentially began way back in the 1960s you see this stretch of road was supposed to be the Spadina expressway houses were expropriated and bonafide expressway was supposed to go all the way downtown instead this quasi expressway ends at a traffic light and that's why you have gridlock almost always here on the Allen Road just proving again that the war on the car isn't gonna go away anytime soon and you know it's such a shame the car is the ultimate freedom machine a car is about independence going where you want to go when you want to go a car is about the mobile embodiment of capitalism from big auto to big oil hmm freedom independence capitalism come to think of it no wonder the progressives hate the automobile for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's Wade Menzies like what you just saw then click subscribe below and never miss another rebel video
