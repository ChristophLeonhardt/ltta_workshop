Prison Reform is one of the political issues that Kim Kardashian has decided to involve herself in and even though her past might have some components that you may disagree with this is an incredibly important issue and she actually traveled to the White House to speak to Donald Trump about the issue of prison reform and to specifically ask for a pardon a pardon for a woman who has been serving decades in prison for a nonviolent drug offense now miss Alice Murray Johnson has a sentence of life behind bars without the possibly possibility of parole she has absolutely no other crimes in her record has never been arrested for anything else never got in trouble prior to this one conviction but unfortunately since it was a drug conviction and because she might be disadvantaged compared to other people who can hire expensive attorneys she got this insane sentence so Kim Kardashian wanted to do what she could to give her an opportunity at a second shot at life so here is a photo that Donald Trump had tweeted of their meeting which is fine great meeting with Kim Kardashian today talked about prison performance sentencing now this was yesterday keep in mind that today Donald Trump pardoned dinesh d'souza who pleaded guilty to his crimes of unlawful campaign donations and he's planning on pardoning others who have been convicted of crimes yes who are all by the way rich and powerful yes Martha Stewart rod Blagojevich and just like I the fact that he did it right after the kardashian meeting he's like oh you're telling me about this african-american great-grandmother who got put away for life and that seems like an incredible injustice yeah whatever dinesh d'souza is the darling of conservative media and does their racist bidding so whatever whatever okay but I enjoyed meeting you it was nice reality show situation I like reality shows okay but now I'm gonna go pardon my powerful Republican friend I know it's devastating and I personally had the opportunity to speak to Alice Murray Johnson we're gonna show you some of the interview that I did last year but before we get to that I want to give you some more details about what she was convicted of and just how remorseful she is Johnson was sentenced back in 1996 for helping a multimillion-dollar cocaine ring something she said she became involved with after she lost her job and was able unable to support her family so she had recently been divorced she lost her job and she also lost her son she was desperate didn't know what to do so she took part in this drug conspiracy and again this was the first crime that she had committed here's a quote from her she said I made the biggest mistake of my life to make ends meet and got involved with people selling drugs this was a road I never dreamed of venturing down I became what is called a telephone mule passing messages between the distributors and sellers I participated in a drug conspiracy and I was wrong and she has been incredibly remorseful she has been a perfect a citizen in in prison you know everyone who has met with her worked with her there it says that she has nothing but good behavior and again the fact that she had has a life sentence with the possible without any possibility of parole is outrageous considering that this was a non-violent drug crime and her first offense no so look a couple things first off she did the crime okay and it is a serious crime the cocaine ring etc so nobody's denying that she's already served 22 years in prison nonviolent and first offense now how many powerful people do you see that get off I mean look even dinesh d'souza even before the pardon he committed a very serious campaign finance violation it's the heart of our system corruption right he had an eight month sentence where he got to leave during the day no let's let's actually let's find something that is a violent crime but someone got off with a measly sentence the Stanford University student who was caught raping a woman in the back of a dumpster okay what was his sentence I believe it was six months and then it was even shortened after that and then remember the kid who affluenza and Ohio people yeah like all those people dead and they were like yeah but the judge is like yeah but he was rich so he didn't know that his actions had consequences so I'm gonna let him off with a light sentence she's serving out he gets a life sentence she gets a life sentence and Trump takes a nice picture no I kid around on on the internet I on Twitter I put it I thought this was when the world was supposed to end right and but I want to be clear in on this note god bless Kim Kardashian it's great that she's fighting for a case of justice here and she could have been doing a lot of different things and she's made a lot a ton of money doing those things but now even even you think it's a late I don't care I don't care it's never too late she's only 37 and furred to turn around to fight for Alice Marie Johnson and not just her but also sin as sinto yeah Brown who's got convicted in 2004 when she was the victim of a rape and sex trap it was being trafficked when she was a teenager yeah you know so Congress just passed the law pretending to care about sex trafficking but in reality it was an attack on the internet it was a backdoor attack on the Internet and they had another new was sex traffic here's a person who was sex trafficked fought back and they're like life sentence yeah okay so great job by Kim Kardashian in actually trying this and thank you for getting the morons attention for a minute right until he got distracted he was like squirrel D'Souza right let at least Marie Johnson out for God's sake man the powerful getaway was so much let her go so I want you to get a sense of who Johnson is and you know I interviewed her last year for an event that Google put together and you know since she's been away for so long she didn't have much communication or physical contact with her daughter so in this video she talks about what it was like to touch and hug her daughter for the first time after she had been in prison for a very long time let's watch kindiy attract a little bit about what it was like to have physical contact with you for the first time I'm curious to hear it was pretty it was more emotional for me when I came back we crushed average American in this country over and over and over again all the powerful get away with anything they want so I I do want to give Kim Kardashian a lot of credit for bringing attention to this issue and people are talking about it now this has become part of you know the national dialogue and and I think it's incredibly important but there are some who are poking fun at her and I'm not talking about private citizens I'm talking about publications like the New York Post which published this disgusting cover essentially making fun of her and her body so let's take a look at it so the other big ass summit kim jong hoon pitches press I mean this is a serious issue I get it I get that Kim Kardashian has a history that she has I get that these are common insults that she deals with but when it comes to this very issue which essentially has people's lives on the line just have a little bit decency just a little bit yeah I don't think look if you're talking about Kim Kardashian and her reality show world and all the different stupid things she does to get attention and you want to make fun of her ass I don't care I don't care at all you can call me anything you like have at it Hoss okay but when she's actually doing something great can you just get off her ass for a second can you like concentrate for a second on what she's actually doing yes right nope nope nope and they're too busy judging and if hey if it makes sense and you she's doing something bad go ahead and judge her for it okay because haven't got it there's a million things to judge Donald Trump on and somebody's got to call him out but the one time she's doing something fantastic give her credit for it and stop talking about her body in that context it's not right if she's flaunting her body and says don't talk about it that's hypocrisy in this case she's flaunting her morals so you might want to talk about that two easy ways for the Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is
