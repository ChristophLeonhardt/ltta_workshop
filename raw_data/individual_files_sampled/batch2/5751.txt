Roger stone who represents a direct line to Richard Nixon Roy Cohn and nowadays Donald Trump is back in the crosshairs of Special Counsel Robert mowers investigation new reporting for The Washington Post today shows Special Counsel Robert mower has been aggressively pursuing leaves whether president Trump's longtime adviser that be Roger stone had advanced knowledge of hacked Democratic emails ahead of the 2016 election in particular on August 21st of 2016 stone tweeted a warning to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta that it would soon be quote Podesta's time in the barrel then on October 5th stone tweeted lives thinking as signs will stand down or wishful thinking payload coming lock them up two days after that WikiLeaks began publishing the stolen emails hacked from Podesta's account Stone has repeatedly denied he had any involvement with the Watergate style hacking he repeated those denials again today to NBC News saying I never received anything including allegedly hacked emails from gusoff or 2.0 the Russian Russians WikiLeaks Assange or anyone else and never passed anything on to Donald Trump the Trump campaign or anyone else as it relates to more that shows collusion is still part of his ongoing investigation don't you think show me right now is Ken Delana NBC News intelligence and national security reporter Elliot Williams former federal prosecutor general Minh I love it because it tells me the mowers back on the heart of this case collusion between the Trump people including Roger stone his fixer dirty trickster as he calls himself and the Russians no one stuff ahead of time the ability to forget forecast something is to me knowledge of something that's going to happen just a thought absolutely and as many as 11 Associates of Roger stone we think have been paraded before that grand jury they've spent hours listening to testimony they've gone over reams of documents and you know Robert Muller doesn't use the grand jury for a fishing expedition Chris if he's doing this there's a reason you wouldn't take all this time for the grand jury if you didn't have some evidence of wrongdoing now stone and then email to me and other other places says he's absolutely innocent didn't do anything very carefully now very carefully warded but in audience say I had no advanced knowledge like it I couldn't find that in there cuz he did it Vince knowledge clearly someone is not telling the truth either him or his comedian friend Randy credit Co either to the grand jury or to Congress someone credit overtaking his credit go throw them under the bus yet someone's throwing somebody under the bus it gets look we've seen this narrative play out before which is you know an associate of Donald Trump saying this this investigation is all joke I'm not gonna participate when a writer died with the President and leave it at that and then eventually when it becomes a point of self preservation that's when they see a bird why do you think Roger put out the word that he'll never flip well he's also raising money on the internet out there trying to raise money for his legal-defense so he's trying to raise money from the true believers right and he's also singling did Trump pardon me yeah and the president that he's going to use the pardon power to you know to help his friends out this guy's big simple tattooed on his back all over and roy cohn going all the way back he's part of that whole line of infamy right it's part of his image to be a tough guy to say I'm never gonna roll over that the liberal media is trying to destroy me Muller in his group of crooks I mean he's been so inflammatory but the bottom line is in August of 2016 he said a number of things and tweeted a number of things that made it seem like he knew this stuff was coming he can't take that baby sighs on the issue of what's coming I keep thinking right that Moore's gonna come out with something fairly soon I don't think he'll wait till next year if he does it this year will it be the whole package collusion and obstruction we you know we don't know it we can remember in the grand scheme of investigations like this we're actually that's why you're here you know if only IRA clairvoyant a GU could predict but we're not that is he that secretive no but we're just not that far into the investigation you know I'm you know you know think about Watergate in iran-contra and all of these investigations took years and years and years was gone by the summer of 74 Watergate was this summer of 72 so it wasn't years and years and years but in the grand scheme of Special Counsel and independent counsel whitewater also defines for all sounds now on his waspey whatever stuff nine years later it had no importance on anybody because it was too late to matter needless to say what don't agree I'm not worried the place to make time take time I think it's time for the get going by the end of every time I ask somebody who knows I'll remote who's seen some of their intelligence what do you think he's got does he have something we haven't seen before they say absolutely there will be bombshells right maybe not presidency ending impeachment right but some very disturbing and on this relation and remember it's not entirely important the WikiLeaks point when he found out or what it's what what that information leads would be nice to know that Russian affected the results of the ninth of the 2008 16 election before they had the 2020 election I'll be probably well meanwhile in Moscow today White House Security Advisor John Bolton don't like that guy much played down the consequences of Russia's interference he played it down in the 2016 election a radio interview Bolden said I told our Russian colleagues that they're meddling in our election process had hardly had any real effect he did add that regardless the behavior shouldn't be tolerated there's no way he can know that because intelligence leaders have said they've never studied this it's outside of their purview but people who have looked at it say it absolutely had an effect well Hillary won the election in the popular vote by millions of votes find me and vote something like that so what do you mean by I had an effect millions of people saw these very divisive messages that we're going after wedge issues and those those working in what a blind by more popular vote well but what about the hundred thousand votes Michigan Pennsylvania isolate that the impact was in this particular industrial state my perspective forget the state's forget the politics did someone meddle in our elections and did people in well be here's and in the Trump campaign did they know about it and did they act on it and I and that you hopefully we find out something like you said very soon is that a peaceful I'm not going to lock in that's a reasonable question somebody help somebody else advance a criminal conspiracy to help them get elected president wouldn't that be impede if there's proof that he knew about it there will absolutely be an impeachment will there be a conviction a 2/3 vote in the Senate well that's politics I wouldn't about the impeach but that's the indictment it's on its face you should throw out and it's certainly worth consideration but anyway parsecity anyway thank you Ken Delaney Delaney another Williams hey
