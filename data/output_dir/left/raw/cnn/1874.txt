1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
now to CNN's Monty Roger tell us what
you're learning about these emails that

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,529
are now under multiple investigations
mano a Brianna we are learning now that

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,250
the President on three separate
occasions discussed this hotel and

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,089
condominium project in Moscow with his
attorney Michael Cohen now that is

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,380
according to a report in Bloomberg in a
separate Washington Post report now says

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,449
Ann in January 2016 Cohen wrote an email
to one of Vladimir Putin's most trusted

7
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,980
aides Dmitry Peskov to know that the
talks between the two over the project

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,668
have stalled and this would mark the
highest level discussion between the

9
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,510
Kremlin official and a trump official
that we know of today now the man who

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,230
was trying to broker this Moscow deal as
a man by the name of Felix Seder a

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,500
Russian American businessman an
associate of the president now sailor

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,629
says in a 2015 email obtained by the New
York Times that quote our boy can become

13
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,219
president of the USA and we can engineer
it saying he would get the Putin's

14
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,109
team's buy-in for the project
now Brianna Cohen is now downplaying the

15
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,120
matter in a statement to CNN saying
today that in late January 2016 I

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,960
abandon the Moscow proposal because I
lost confidence that the prospective

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,060
licensee would bring the proposal to
fruition it was a building proposal that

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,860
did not succeed and nothing more Cohen
also said subsequently to CNN that he

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,909
sent an email to that Putin aide Peskov
regarding the Moscow project saying it

20
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,000
was an email that went unanswered and
nothing else and he also told

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,330
congressional investigators that that
sailor actually made that recommend

22
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,290
recommendation to reach out to that
Putin aid but Brianna all these

23
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,680
developments undercut the president's
regular claims that there were no

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,150
business dealings whatsoever with Russia
yeah they certainly do and Monti this

25
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,159
isn't the only email that's under review
that shows an attempt to connect the

26
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,460
Trump campaign with Russian officials
right yeah that's right Brianna last

27
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,990
week CNN reported about an email from a
top Trump aid Rick Dearborn turned over

28
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,920
to the hill that showed him relaying a
message from an individual from West

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,060
Virginia who wanted to set up a meeting
with a Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,170
now cNN has learned that the West
Virginia man is a 54 year old contractor

31
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,209
named Rick clay who also informed GOP
senator Shelley Moore Capito he wanted

32
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,140
to talk to the campaign about Russian
contacts now clay told me that he was

33
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,060
simply trying to
his own message from a friend who works

34
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,689
with Christian organized organizations
who had been in contact with Russians

35
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:24,129
who wanted to discuss quote shared
Christian values with the campaign

36
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,760
Dearborn we were told rejected the
requests and said it should go through

37
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,420
the State Department but intelligence
officials say Brianna this is a growing

38
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,739
practice of Russian intelligence to try
to build alliances with conservative

39
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,760
groups to try to penetrate the political
system now that's uncertain if that's

40
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,220
what happened here about something that
investigators will have to look into

41
00:02:42,220 --> 00:00:00,000
further Brianna all right Monty Roger
thank you so much we have our eye
