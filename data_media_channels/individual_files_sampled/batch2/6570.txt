one of the revelations coming out of today's indictments in the Muller investigation is that one of the goals at least early on during the primary and then to some extent during the general election of the involvement our election was that they were obviously promoting Donald Trump and perhaps even more than that opposing Hillary Clinton but also at the same time at various times trying to boost Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein which technically we already knew about this from the ads that BuzzFeed released but some people are acting very surprised by this and I have already seen editorials attacking Bernie Sanders over this and he put out a statement today about these indictments and he is being attacked for not specifically referencing the fact that some of the social media activity was benefiting him now I have a response to that but first I do want to read his statement senator Bernie Sanders said Friday that Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and intent to get involved in this year's midterm elections quote has been clear to everyone except president Trump and he said it is the American people who should be deciding the political future of our country not mr. Putin in the Russian oligarchs it is absolutely imperative that the Moller investigation be allowed to go forward without obstruction from the Trump administration or Congress and so like I said some people who I'm gonna guess have not liked Bernie Sanders for a long time don't understand the difference between Donald Trump being helped by the Russians and Bernie Sanders to a much lesser extent being helped by the Russians but there is a very big difference Donald Trump has been trying to cover for these crimes for literally years now and has been denying that they even existed whereas Bernie Sanders from the very beginning has been outspoken and saying that we need to investigate and find out what happened who did it we need to indict anyone who might have aided those people or the people themselves wherever they might be from and we need to do whatever is necessary to make sure that it doesn't happen in the future he has been outspoken he has not attempted to minimize or distract from these organized these investigations like Donald Trump has which is why it is in no way the same thing it's almost as if one is a corrupt self-dealing politician and the other one is an honest actor almost like that right like for example if Ghana decided randomly that they were gonna help the Young Turks I'd like okay but like if it's illegal some way no I didn't ask for it hey that's different then got up over here to pick a random country if you did a press conference where you literally asked for Ghana to hack the emails of some other channel right and and of course a scope is very very important here Shou Shou tiny bit of health to Bernie Sanders overwhelming support for Donald Trump and and of course it's a politically driven folks who go Judah Barney the Brody look over there alright we don't like him either so that and and and Bernie's done exactly what he anybody in the institution can do please go indict those people I think that's right jegging I think to add to it I think the most disturbing that you see in Washington is Republicans trying to sort of muddy the waters on Russia and the Democrats sort of I almost want to say they're like aiding and abetting them in the muddying of the waters right so they released this they released their memo hash tag release the memo and you read the memo you're like this has nothing to do with the Muller investigation and then the Democrats like we need to respond to something like no don't respond will just say does this have anything to do with the Trump meeting the Don jr. meeting with the Russians about the sanctions is there anything to do with the fact that the president won't say that Russian engage in our election no and I really feel like Democrats need to take a page out of like the old my old grandmother's book we're just gonna watch and pray and wait baby and things are gonna happen and all and that is exactly what molar is going to get to the bottom of this he is the best prosecutor this country has and he's going to get to the bottom of it's gonna take time but if we continue to sort of play this if we get in the weeds with these Republicans they muddy the waters we only take away the credibility from Muller and this investigation because we all we know now that the house investigation is is a crapshoot right and we know the Senate investigation is close to a crapshoot maybe one day shy of a crapshoot so the only real investigation that matters it has real power is the smaller investigation and they're getting somewhere and I think Democrats are missing this message over and over again you don't hear Democrats at all talking about the that today's your National Security Advisor plead guilty I mean isn't your campaign former campaign chairman indicted isn't one of your what is it one of your George papadopolis even isn't he really wearing a wire like these are all things that are part of the investigation that Democrats miss when they talk about it and so when Republicans make this argument is Russia Russia Russia all day they're sort of right because Democrats have lost them they've lost the narrative and they're over here Republicans I look fire and Democrats those all let me get a hose and instead of saying there's no fire here the facts yeah and to that point for the people some of the Democrats who now want to blame Bernie because this can be and did anybody from Bernie staff write a note to the Russians saying hey do you have information on Hillary I love it did any of his staffers get indicted did any of our any of them under investigation no you know why because they weren't actively looking for help from the Russians like the Trump campaign was so giant giant difference if you care about the facts you just watch the video by The Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
