>>BEVERLY YOUNG NELSON IS ONE
OF THE WOMEN WHO ACCUSED ROY
MOORE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WHEN SHE
WAS A 16-YEAR-OLD WAITRESS.
SHE
IS THE ACCUSER WHO HAD THE
YEARBOOK SIGNED BY ROY MOORE AND
PROVIDED IT AS EVIDENCE THAT ROY
MOORE DID IN FACT KNOW HER, AND
SIGNED THAT YEARBOOK.
NOW THERE
IS A TWIST TO THE STORY BECAUSE
APPARENTLY SHE ADDED A DATE TO
THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HE SIGNED,
CONSERVATIVES CAUGHT ONTO THAT,
NOW THEY ARE SAYING THE ENTIRE
THING HAS BEEN FORGED, WHICH IS
ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE, THEY ARE
JUST DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO
DISCREDIT HER, AND IN ADDITION
DISCREDIT ANYONE ELSE WHO IS
ACCUSED HIM OF MISCONDUCT.
NOW
--
>>NOW OF COURSE CONSERVATIVES
ARE TAKING THAT ONE SMALL THING
AND TURNING IT INTO A MASSIVE
STORY WHERE THEY ARE PRETENDING
AS IF THE ENTIRE THING WAS MADE
UP, COMPLETELY FABRICATED, AND
AGAIN THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I'LL GIVE
YOU SOME HEADLINES.
FIRST,
BREITBART, THEY HAD THE HEADLINE
THAT SAYS BOMBSHELL: ROY MOORE
ACCUSER BEVERLY NELSON ADMITS
SHE FORGED YEARBOOK.
>>SHE DIDN'T ADMIT THAT AT ALL.
>>THAT IS A FLAT OUT LIE, FOX
NEWS ALSO JUMPED ON THE STORY
AND LATER HAD TO RETRACT IT
BECAUSE THEY ALSO LIED --
>>THE TWEET THEY SENT OUT SAID
--
>>NOW, IN THE ARTICLE THEY
ACTUALLY CHANGED THE WORD FORGED
TO SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE
ACCURATE, AND THE STORY
ALSO SAYS, AND THIS IS ALSO
UNTRUE --
>>SO THAT'S WHAT THE ARTICLE ON
FOX NEWS WROTE.
MOORE NEVER,
NEVER PRESIDED OVER NELSON'S
DIVORCE CASE, THAT AGAIN WAS A
FLAT OUT LIE, FOX NEWS HAD TO
RETRACT THAT.
>>BUT JUST LIKE BRIAN ROSS THEY
HAVE SUSPENDED EVERYONE INVOLVED
WITH ALL THOSE MISTAKES FOR FOUR
WEEKS WITHOUT PAY.
BECAUSE I
KNOW FOX NEWS WAS VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT GETTING THINGS ACCURATE AT
THAT MOMENT.
THESE ARE VERY
IMPORTANT ISSUES, THEY ARE ALL
SUSPENDED, RIGHT?
OH, THEY ARE
NOT SUSPENDED?
THAT IS SO WEIRD.
I'M SURE BREITBART SUSPENDED THE
GUY WHO WROTE THE HEADLINE,
RIGHT?
COME ON.
A COUPLE OF
THE GUYS WHO STARTED THIS ARE
THE SAME ALT-RIGHT CHARACTERS
WHO DID PIZZA GATE, WHO WENT ON
TO SMEAR A MOST EVERYBODY THEY
OPPOSE, THEY CALL ALMOST
EVERYONE THEY OPPOSE PEDOPHILES
AND CHILD MOLESTERS, BECAUSE
THEY WANT TO PROTECT CHILD
MOLESTERS LIKE ROY MOORE, SO YOU
JUST MARK IT UP AND CALL
EVERYONE A CHILD MOLESTER UNTIL
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON AND
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA CALLS IT
EVEN.
SHE WROTE AN ANNOTATION,
THIS IS WHEN IT WAS SAID -- IF
SHE WANTED TO FORGE THE WHOLE
THING, WHY WOULDN'T SHE WRITE
THE WHOLE THING IN THE SAME
HANDWRITING?
WHY IS THERE TWO
DIFFERENT HANDWRITINGS?
OR WHY
WOULD YOU BOTHER TO GET SOMEONE
ELSE TO WRITE IT IN ROY MOORE'S
HANDWRITING AND AT A SECOND
THING IN YOUR HANDWRITING,
THEREBY TIPPING PEOPLE OFF?
NO,
IT'S BECAUSE ROY MOORE WROTE THE
THING, WHICH IN THE BEGINNING HE
DIDN'T EVEN DENY.
AND MY
FAVORITE QUOTE OF HIS NOW IS
THAT HE QUESTIONS WHETHER
EVERYTHING WRITTEN IN THAT
YEARBOOK WAS WRITTEN BY ROY
MOORE.
OF COURSE NOT EVERYTHING
IN THE YEARBOOK WAS WRITTEN BY
ROY MOORE.
IN OTHER WORDS, HE
DOESN'T WANT TO DENY THAT HE
WROTE THE PART HE WROTE, BUT HE
SAYS I DIDN'T WRITE EVERYTHING
IN THE YEARBOOK.
NO ONE IS
SAYING YOU DID.
>>SO STUPID.
AND LOOK, MOST
PEOPLE READ HEADLINES, THEY WILL
READ A HEADLINE AND THINK THEY
KNOW ALL THE DETAILS OF THE
STORY BASED ON THE HEADLINE.
SO
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE GET INTO THE
NUANCE OF WHAT NELSON OR ROY
MOORE WROTE?
NO, THEY WILL READ
THAT HEADLINE FROM BREITBART AND
USE IT FOR THEIR JUSTIFICATION
FOR VOTING FOR MOORE.
SO MY
MESSAGE TO THOSE PEOPLE IS,
BASED ON WHAT THE POLLS
CURRENTLY SAY, ROY MOORE IS
LIKELY TO WIN.
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE MOLESTATION OR THE
SEXUAL ASSAULT OR THE WOMEN IN
YOUR STATE OR ABOUT TEENAGERS
WHO WERE DEALING WITH SEXUAL
MISCONDUCT AT ROY MOORE'S HAND,
SO STOP TWISTING AND TURNING
THINGS SO YOU CAN JUSTIFY VOTING
FOR HIM.
YOU DON'T CARE, BE
PROUD OF THAT FACT AND VOTE FOR
HIM.
>>JUST SAY IT.
LIKE SAM KINISON
LEGENDARILY SAID, SAY IT!
>>THESE MENTAL EXERCISES THEY
ARE DOING TO JUSTIFY AND FEEL
BETTER ABOUT THEMSELVES, NO, YOU
ARE A BAD PERSON.
YOU LIKE
VOTING IN FAVOR OF CHILD
MOLESTERS BECAUSE YOU THINK
DEMOCRATS ARE WORSE.
>>ONE OF THE ALT-RIGHT GUYS
SPREADING THIS HAS ADMITTED HE
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT RAPE.
YOU
KNOW WHY YOU'RE DOING THESE
TRICKS?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW MOST OF
THE PEOPLE DON'T AGREE WITH YOU,
THAT'S WHY YOU TRY TO TRICK
PEOPLE INTO BEING ON YOUR SIDE
BY PRETENDING TO HAVE FACTS YOU
DON'T HAVE.
>>I THINK THE MOST IRONIC THING
EVER IS THAT FOX NEWS RETRACTS
THE THING ABOUT THE DIVORCE, BUT
THEY ARE STANDING BY THEIR
DENIAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
>>AND JUST ABOUT EVERY OTHER
LIE THEY DO.
>>IT'S LIKE, WE ARE SORRY WE
GOT THAT WRONG, BUT CLIMATE
CHANGE STILL ISN'T A THING.
>>THE UNEVEN PLAYING FIELD IS
WHAT RIGHTLY CRAZY, I TALK ABOUT
IT ALL THE TIME.
WHEN THE PRESS
TREATS THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT
EQUALLY, THEY ARE NOT EQUAL.
YOUR JOB IS NOT TO BE NEUTRAL,
IT'S TO BE OBJECTIVE.
THE RIGHT
WING HAS A BUNCH OF MONSTERS
THAT LIE ON PURPOSE AND THEN
BRAG ABOUT IT.
ONE OF THE THINGS
THESE ALT-RIGHT GUYS DO IS LET'S
MAKE UP A THING ABOUT HOW A GUY
IS A SEXUAL PREDATOR WHO WAS
TOTALLY INNOCENT AND LET'S TRY
TO GET IT BE NUMBER ONE ON
GOOGLE SEARCH SO ANYONE WHO
GOOGLES HIS NAME WILL THINK HE'S
A CHILD MOLESTER BECAUSE WE
DON'T LIKE HIM POLITICALLY.
YOU
WILL TAKE THAT GUY ABOUT A VS
WORD AS LEGITIMATE, ARE YOU
INSANE?
AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE
TO HAVE GUTS AND SAY I'M GOING
TO BE A REAL JOURNALIST I HAVE
TO CALL THINGS AS THEY ARE AND
NOT BE AFRAID OF THE REPUBLICAN
ALT-RIGHT OR BREITBART OR FOX
NEWS WILL YELL AT ME.
THERE ARE
MONSTERS WHO GO BUMP IN THE
NIGHT, IT'S THOSE GUYS, YOU HAVE
SEEN THEIR TRACK RECORD, BUT
STILL THEY WILL BE AFRAID.
BREITBART IS NOTHING BUT LIES.
SO NO, HOW CAN YOU TAKE
BREITBART SERIOUSLY?
AND THEN
FOR FOX NEWS, THEY ARE A GATEWAY
DRUG TO THE ALT-RIGHT NONSENSE.
IT GOES BOTH WAYS, THEY TAKE
THAT STUFF AND PUT IT OUT THERE,
AND THEY DO A TRICK THAT THE
PENTAGON DOES.
WE DIDN'T BOMB
CIVILIANS, THEY WILL BLARE IT IN
THE HEADLINES, EVERYBODY PRINTS
IT, NEW YORK TIMES, THEY DID NOT
BOMB CIVILIANS, PENNING ON SAYS.
TWO WEEKS LATER THE PENTAGON
SAYS WE MIGHT HAVE BOMBED
CIVILIANS, THAT DOES IN A17 IN A
CORRECTION NO ONE EVER READS.
SO
FOX NEWS GOES FORGERY, EVERYBODY
READS IT, THEN WHEN NO ONE IS
PAYING ATTENTION, HOURS OR DAYS
LATER WITH NO CONSEQUENCE TO
ANYONE WHO WROTE IT, THEY WILL
SAY BY THE WAY AND WASN'T A
FORGERY, AND BY THE WAY HE NEVER
WAS INVOLVED IN THAT CASE.
AND
NO ONE WILL SEE THAT, AND THEY
WILL HAVE RILED UP ENOUGH PEOPLE
TO GO VOTE FOR ROY MOORE.
THAT
IS THE AGENDA OF FOX NEWS.
THE
FACT THAT NOT ONLY ARE THEY PART
OF THE SO-CALLED LEGITIMATE
PRESS, BUT THEY WERE RUNNING THE
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS
DINNER AND GROUP -- I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY WERE, THEY WERE UNTIL
RECENTLY -- IT'S A JOKE.
AND
WHEN OBAMA SAID WE SHOULD
CHALLENGE FOX NEWS, HOW DARE
YOU?
ARE BELOVED FOX NEWS
COLLEAGUES, WHO I WOULD LIKE TO
JOIN LATER FOR REALLY HIGH
SALARY -- LOOK, WHEN HOWARD
KURTZ USED TO KISS FOX NEWS'S
ASS WHEN HE WAS ON CNN, I SAID
ON THIS SHOW THE REASON HE WAS
DOING IT IS BECAUSE ONE DAY HE
MIGHT WORK AT FOX NEWS.
AND
GUESS WHAT HAPPENED, ONE DAY
HOWARD KURTZ MOVED TO FOX NEWS
AND NOW GIVES A HEFTY PAYCHECK
TO KISS THEIR ASS ON THEIR AIR.
BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE
SAME GROUP GETTING PAID.
