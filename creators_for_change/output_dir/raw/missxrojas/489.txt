00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,469
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important to stress how much</font>

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,659
I'm enjoying my time in the US I know

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I kind of have a tendency to tweet</font>

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,140
about things that kind of niggle me or

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,910
annoy me such as when people who seem to

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Halloween is a US invention asked</font>

7
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,259
me if<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> celebrated in the UK yeah it's</font>

8
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,170
kind of Celtic leads me to ask whether

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,850
they've ever read Harry Potter and the

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,260
Philosopher's Stone I don't even want to

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,699
know the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that these are</font>

12
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,859
trivial stupid funny random<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

13
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,510
points and not at all representative of

14
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,220
my time<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's a home that being said I</font>

15
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,080
have been finding writing here and going

16
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,789
to be difficult and in kind of in both

17
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,769
in academic sense and a creative sense

18
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,170
vastly on the academic side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

19
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first essay I got back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hills covered</font>

20
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">and rewrites why didn't use first person</font>

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,160
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have used I hear and I tried</font>

22
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">so hard not to be disheartened I tried</font>

23
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,539
to use it as constructive criticism and

24
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,489
I kept coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> against a similar wall</font>

25
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,920
in all of my classes until I realized

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,329
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the professor's here are asking for</font>

27
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,649
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different from the</font>

28
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,719
lectures and seminar to tease that came

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,719
the works cited page from an essay I

30
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,879
really last year and the one line work

31
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,949
cited that I wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> on before i handed in</font>

32
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,500
an essay on John Milton I<font color="#CCCCCC"> needed even</font>

33
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">have written it because no one else</font>

34
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,560
included it because we only were using

35
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,060
one book I think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty fair</font>

36
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,799
to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UK system is more</font>

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,659
research base as a whole the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. system</font>

38
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">places a lot more focus on your</font>

39
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,409
individual response to the text near the

40
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,049
system is inherently better or worse but

41
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,490
the useful thing I've come to realize is

42
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,460
how i right how I work working with a

43
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,590
large range of<font color="#CCCCCC"> text to better illuminate</font>

44
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,140
and kind of establish my position rather

45
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,299
than the reader response approach I

46
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,130
suppose it's not like a blind read your

47
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,170
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> which they have hit they do do</font>

48
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,880
a lot of theory and things but it's just

49
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,610
not used in the same way creatively the

50
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,350
writing i do my free time here is pretty

51
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,450
crap when I went to Chicago evoked a

52
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,430
breaker kind of felt something unlock in

53
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,470
my head and I wrote an awful lot I don't

54
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,549
know where there was the big body of

55
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,320
water that is Lake Michigan I have a

56
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,780
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> for bodies of water i spent 19</font>

57
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,640
years of my life living super<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to</font>

58
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,100
the tens I can't allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself to fall</font>

59
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,780
back on writer's block I can't allow

60
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,329
myself to use the excuse that writing

61
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,880
and learning in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as differ</font>

learning opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> fulfill excerpt and</font>

64
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,179
creative ideas just like stuck inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

65
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:09,830
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the creative outlet isn't</font>

66
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,720
functioning and the way they used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and</font>

67
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,060
I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just I find it really hard</font>

68
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,040
we all know I find it impossible to

69
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,160
reckon with my warped I do of academic

70
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,630
failure I feel like I'll come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

71
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're a better writer of foot a writer</font>

72
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,230
if i push through creatively I mean

73
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,760
perhaps this<font color="#CCCCCC"> blog won't happen again or</font>

74
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,170
at least I'll know how to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

75
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,940
it's very strange being unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write</font>

76
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,280
is normal unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus I get very</font>

77
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">scared sometimes that that would be</font>

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,540
taken away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from me I couldn't function</font>

79
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,819
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability to write and read I</font>

80
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:41,830
really really could not but it is just a

81
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,049
horrible sometimes so that has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

82
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:47,030
biggest challenge that and the lack of
