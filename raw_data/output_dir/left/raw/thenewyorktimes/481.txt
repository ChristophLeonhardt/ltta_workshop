1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,607
It was a cold but very

2
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:09,142
sunny day,

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:10,877
and we were having a rally a

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,680
the Audubon Ballroom.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,348
Two weeks prior to that, he had

6
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,850
been banned from France when

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,085
he tried to go to speak in Paris.

8
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,120
The next weekend,

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,756
his home was firebombed.

10
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,057
But I always remember him

11
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,291
saying,

12
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,626
"The way I feel today, I

13
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,328
shouldn't even be here."

14
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,163
We said to him, “Then why

15
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,831
don't you go home? Everybody

16
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,166
can understand all the pressure

17
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,968
you've been under."

18
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,637
And he said, "No. I really have to

19
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:38,605
speak today."

20
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:40,573
I heard Brother Malcolm say,

21
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,409
“asalam alaykum,” and next thing

22
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,046
I heard were the shots.

23
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,447
I ran all the way down the

24
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,548
Audubon and jumped up on the

25
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,849
stage.

26
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:50,984
His shirt was open, and I saw

27
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,819
all these holes in his body,

28
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,554
and he was gasping. And I

29
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:55,955
remember thinking to myself,

30
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,524
"He's going to die,

31
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:05,532
he's going to die. "

32
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:06,800
These brothers came up and

33
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,234
had to roll a stretcher

34
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:09,569
because not one doctor would

35
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,737
come over to the Audubon.

36
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:11,638
They were right across the

37
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,605
street and they had to

38
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,207
bogart a stretcher. And

39
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,308
they rolled it back over to the

40
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,378
hospital, and

41
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,446
it was announced that

42
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:24,250
he had died.

43
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,685
I stayed up all night.

44
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,287
I was just sitting there. I was

45
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,688
half crying.

46
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,091
I was angry.

47
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,926
The next day, I sat down

48
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,527
and I wrote.

49
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,196
I wrote about God.

50
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,797
Brother Malcolm had the ability

51
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,732
to inspire people.

52
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:40,800
To make them transcend their

53
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,502
own narrow interests and think

54
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,904
of a larger entity.

55
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:45,972
I think the human rights

56
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,508
movement was derailed

57
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,843
by the assassinations of

58
00:01:49,943 --> 00:00:00,000
Brother Malcolm and Dr. King.
