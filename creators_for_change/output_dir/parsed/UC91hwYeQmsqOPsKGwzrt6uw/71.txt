whoa we get time alone together and we
go ahead and go work out well I put
these carbs in my body yeah
I'm excited this is my first time going
away yeah we got our passes I mean but
we've had a passion for keeping an eye
Jenna wake up
you trust Frank
I think Frank has a lot of experience
under it no yeah I don't trust I just
know he's cheap
but Anaya loves him and the kids love in
June that's a plus
we're not having more done in a while
where's part of my body am i ready to
have sword
I went in my legs but I go up and down
the stairs a lot
I would say my arms going carry a baby
alone
so I think I'm gonna be taking else
either way what about you
I maybe have some apps car yelling apps
I think I would like to work out
my legs in my house
thirsty
I do legs if you want with you but do
you want to workout with me
I don't want to be on in the gym on a
date I don't know if I have we ever
worked out together my path we're
outside yeah but not a gym that's crazy
that we never worked out at the gym
can you stop by the gas station get some
water
I totally would not yeah this wasn't a
really good way to go do you want to
just do you wanna start
you're welcome something wrong with the
water
since you taste because I chose it
because it looked like something that
was better for us and Aquafina I forget
what you love
how does it look like it's better than I
just I just looked at it based on would
it look like
that's what I thought it let's go this
is the face of somebody who has time
with their husband but brings me here
tell me something Glynn anything for it
store
we can change this part to make the
resistance
it's just not a lot of life
and at that time I know about that
how's Bruce I know how tall
I didn't put deodorant on this morning
they said that kind of loud oh my gosh
you line up
and 205 calories guys I did two miles in
35 minutes and burn 205 calories people
often ask us if we want more kids and
they always say it like do we want more
pizza or do we want another car but what
they're really asking is do you want
more life around you and the answer to
that question is yes I do want more life
around me I also don't want to miss life
as well I miss my wife I don't care what
we're doing she's fun she's a pleasure
to be around and we genuinely are
friends so when people ask me if I want
another child I feel like that maybe
taking away from what my wife and I may
have some of you guys know because you
have children it's harder to get a date
night when you have more than one kid
when you have two kids it's not as hard
but when you have three you're pushing
it for me I just don't want to feel like
I'm missing moments with her though with
the children I already have the Bible
says be fruitful and multiply and when
you say that you don't want any kids
people look at you as if you don't want
to be fruitful and that couldn't be
further from the truth
because being fruitful isn't so much
about how much fruit you have but how
great is the fruit you've already
produced am i investing everything I
have into my current fruit or am i
trying to collect as much fruit as
possible
we've only try working out together like
maybe four times and every time she's
full of fun and games if she goes to the
gym with Melissa or Diana or any of
these other women and she's known
throughout her history she will be for
real
who will meet she wants to play games
cuz when you have a long time with your
husband you're supposed to be having fun
come on let's do this
and that's around folks did you enjoy
yourself
I survived did you enjoy yourself I did
I used to be a beast in the gym alright
happy new year anyways once upon a time
I used to learn now like everyone talks
in the morning I was very disciplined
and then I feel like I became like an
adult with real responsibilities and
anyways I became an adult with no
responsibilities I got married so I'm
working full time my focus was on work
then I started having children and it
literally seems like it literally seems
like every time I was about to get
really serious about working out again I
came pregnant so I wouldn't be surprised
if I end up pregnant in the next three
months if we get pregnant without the
doctor anyway all that to say
I am I'm excited to find some more
discipline in my life I'm thankful to
the YMCA for having childcare so
hopefully I can find a schedule what's
that
yo how's it going hey hey what's going
on believe we're chillin you sure it
seems like I having a little bit too
much fun all right we're on our way back
we gonna stop and get a smoothie and
then we're two hours
and these are the classes yeah morning
hours are from 7:45 to 1:30 that's
pretty good
