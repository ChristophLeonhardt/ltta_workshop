1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,610
THERE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE CASE OF THE TWO

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,720
BLACK MEN WHO GOT ARRESTED FOR
ESSENTIALLY ASKING TO USE

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,410
THE BATHROOM AT STARBUCKS.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:20,369
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS AS A
RESULT.

5
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:28,550
AMAZING.

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:38,040
THESE GUYS ARE AMAZING.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,460
COOLEST PEOPLE ALIVE.

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,960
I WOULD'VE LOOKED FOR A PAYDAY
FOR SURE, BUT I AM TERRIBLE.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,180
THEY ARE RECEIVING SOME
COMPENSATION FROM STARBUCKS.

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,820
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT?

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,930
I COULD BE WRONG, BUT I WAS
READING THAT STARBUCKS IS

12
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,410
OFFERING THEM A SETTLEMENT AS
WELL, BUT FROM THE CITY

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,520
THEY ARE RECEIVING THIS.

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,370
SOME PEOPLE ONLINE WERE SAYING,
YES, THEY ARE TRYING TO DO

15
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,009
THE TAYLOR SWIFT ONE DOLLARS AND
THE MESSAGE THING.

16
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:08,090
IT IS NOT ABOVE THE MONEY, WHEN
THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH

17
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,469
WITH ONE DOLLAR BUT ULTIMATELY,
I THINK THAT IS WONDERFUL,

18
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,549
THAT THEY ARE FUNNELING THAT
MONEY INTO PLACES I COULD

19
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:16,759
BE BETTER SERVED TO EDUCATE
AND INFLUENCE YOUNGER

20
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,009
GENERATIONS TO MAKE AWESOME
THINGS IN THE FUTURE.

21
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,840
THERE'S NO BAD HERE.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,999
SO GREAT.

23
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,280
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH
THE STARBUCKS THING.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,090
HOPEFULLY IT'S AN UNDISCLOSED
SUM.

25
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,929
I THINK THEY JUST GOT GIFT
CARDS FROM STARBUCKS.

26
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:32,179
STARPOINTS.

27
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:37,079
ON YOUR POINT ABOUT THE
DOLLAR, THE ONLINE STUFF

28
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,979
THAT YOU HAD SEEN.

29
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:43,009
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST OR EVEN
THE THOUSAND EXAMPLE OF

30
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:45,710
SOMEBODY TAKING A DOLLAR ON THE
CIVIL SUIT.

31
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:50,130
OFTENTIMES CIVIL SUITS ARE
FILED TO MAKE A POINT, CIVIL

32
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,680
RIGHTS POINT OR OTHER AND THE
DOLLAR IS OFTEN TIMES THE

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,229
AMOUNT THAT IS SOUGHT.

34
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,309
YOU CAN TELL, HEY, IT IS A
HIGHER IDEAL THAT IS BEING

35
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:00,309
APPLIED HERE.

36
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:02,270
THAT IS THE REASON THEY WENT FOR
A DOLLAR TURN OF, IN THIS

37
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,179
CASE THE DOLLAR WAS TO BE
SYMBOLIC AND MORE IMPORTANT

38
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:10,709
THING THAT FOLLOWS IS THE GRANTS
MONEY AND THEY REEDUCATION

39
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,630
PROGRAM THAT THEY ARE DOING AT
STARBUCKS ARE

40
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,819
THE FOLLOW-THROUGH IS
IMPORTANT.

41
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:15,879
HERE IS THAT STARBUCKS
ANNOUNCED THAT IT REACHED AN

42
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:19,020
AGREEMENT FOR AN UNDISCLOSED
FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT AND

43
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,480
I'LL STARBUCKS IS GOING TO
CONTINUE TO LISTEN AND

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,909
CREATE A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE
PARTIES AND THE OPPORTUNITY.

45
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:28,980
I LIKE HOW STARBUCKS IS REALLY
LEANING INTO THIS.

46
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,150
I DO THINK THAT THEY NEEDED A
DAY, THEY ARE TAKING THE DAY MAY

47
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,790
29 TO CLOSE ALL DOORS TO HAVE
TRAINING ON RACIAL BIAS

48
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,900
WHICH SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT
THAT IS NOT COOL.

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,340
I THINK THAT IS A STEP IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION FOR A

50
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,540
COMPANY TO SAY, THIS IS WHAT WE
CAN DO SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.

51
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,450
THE RACIAL BIAS TRAINING IS
ONE THAT HAS KIND OF BECOME

52
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,180
EN VOGUE FOR VARIOUS
CORPORATIONS BECAUSE AS

53
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,470
OPPOSED TO THE PREVIOUS WAY OF
DOING IT WHICH LOOKED AT

54
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,879
FOLKS AND WAS LIKE OKAY, THIS
GUY IS THE PROBLEM, YOU ARE

55
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,510
BEING A PROBLEM AND IT IS YOU
PERSONALLY, IT IS MICHAEL'S

56
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,749
GUY HERE OF THE OFFICE WHO IS
THE PROBLEM.

57
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:06,060
NOW IT IS LIKE, IT IS NO ONE'S
FAULT, IT IS PROBABLY JUST

58
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,060
IMPLICIT.

59
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,110
SOME PEOPLE ARE MAKING
ASSUMPTIONS THAT NO ONE

60
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,829
EVEN KNOWS THAT THEY ARE
MAKING, IT IS JUST IMPLICIT SO

61
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:12,829
LET'S ADDRESS IT.

62
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:15,739
AT LEAST IT IS GETTING ADDRESSED
IN THESE GUYS AND THEIR

63
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:20,209
LEGAL TEAM ARE PLAYING A ROLE IN
THAT AND I THINK THAT IS GREAT.

64
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:21,209
THEY ARE CLOSING 8000

65
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,560
STORES, THEY'RE GOING TO PASS
OFF AMERICA.

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,560
THAT 2 PM COFFEE RUSH THAT
YOU DON'T GET IS GOING TO BE

67
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,079
DIRE, BUT ALSO THE AMOUNT OF
MONEY, IF YOU WANT TO GET

68
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,219
FINANCIAL WITH IT, THE AMOUNT OF
MONEY THAT STARBUCKS IS GOING TO

69
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:38,890
LOSE WITHIN THAT TIMEFRAME IS
SUBSTANTIAL, SO AGAIN, I LOVE

70
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,319
STARBUCKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
YOUR MOCHA LATTES AND YEAH,

71
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,380
IT IS GOOD STUFF.

72
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,079
HERE'S A STATEMENT FROM THE
MAYOR.

73
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,549
YOU WANT THE MAYOR TO REALLY
STRIKE, THE CITY OF

74
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:57,849
BROTHERLY LOVE TO MAKE IT UP.

75
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:06,310
HE GOES:

76
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,849
WAY TO HIT THE EMOTIONAL
TONE THERE, JIM KENNEY.

77
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:13,340
DID YOU JUST RUN A BUNCH OF
LEGAL TERMS THROUGH A BLENDER?

78
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,680
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE MOST
HILARIOUS STATEMENT, AND ATTEMPT

79
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,750
TO BE LISTEN, WE WANTED TO FOCUS
ON THE FUTURE OF AMERICA

80
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,750
AND RIGHTING WRONGS.

81
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:28,530
HE HAS LIKE IT WOULD'VE BEEN A
LOT OF LEGAL PAIN.

82
00:04:28,530 --> 00:00:00,000
PRETTY CRAZY.
