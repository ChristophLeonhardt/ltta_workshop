>> Harris: NEGOTIATIONS
CONTINUE WITH NORTH KOREA.
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF ALSO
EXPRESSING A DESIRE TO
EVENTUALLY BRING HOME THE
THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN TROOPS
STATIONED ON THE KOREAN
PENINSULA.
BUT ADMITTING YOU'RE NOT QUITE
THERE YET.
HERE ARE SOME OF WHAT THE
PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY EARLIER
TODAY IN SINGAPORE.
>> WE WILL BE STOPPING THE WAR
GAMES WHICH WILL SAVE US A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE
FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS IS NOT GOING
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD.
PLUS IT'S VERY PROVOCATIVE.
>> Harris: LUCAS TOMLINSON IS
LIVE AT THE PENTAGON WITH
DETAILS ON THE DETAILS.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
BECAUSE THE PENTAGON CALLS THESE
JOINT EXERCISE OF THE
SOUTH KOREA DEFENSIVE IN NATURE.
THE TERM PROVOCATIVE IS LIKELY
TO RAISE EYEBROWS HERE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS FOR NOW,
ALL U.S. TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA
WILL REMAIN DESPITE HIS CALLS TO
SUSPEND THE DRILLS.
>> I'M DOING SOME OF THAT I
WANTED TO DO FROM THE BEGINNING.
WE STOP PLAYING THOSE WAR GAMES
THAT COST US A FORTUNE.
EVERY MONTH WE ARE DOING
WAR GAMES WITH SOUTH KOREA.
I SAID WHAT IS THIS COSTING?
WE ARE FLYING PLANES AND FROM
GUAM AND BOMBING ANTI-MOUNTAINS
FOR PRACTICE AND I SAID I WANT
TO STOP THAT AND I WILL STOP
THAT AND I THINK IT'S VERY
PROVOCATIVE.
ESPECIALLY SINCE WE ARE GETTING
ALONG.
>> IN A STATEMENT, SPOKESMAN
SAYS "U.S. FORCES KOREA HAS
RECEIVED NO UPDATE TO INCLUDE
THIS SUMMER FALL SCHEDULED
FREEDOM GUARDIAN.
IN COURT NATION WITH OUR
SOUTH KOREAN PARTNERS, WE WILL
CONTINUE WITH OUR CURRENT
MILITARY POSTURE UNTIL WE
RECEIVE UPDATED GUIDANCE FROM
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.
OFFICIALS SAY THE U.S. MILITARY
WILL CONTINUE DRILLS IN JAPAN
BUT HAS TWICE AS MANY TROOPS.
LONG-RANGE BOMBERS WILL CONTINUE
TRAINING FLIGHTS FROM GUAM.
YESTERDAY DEFENSE SECRETARY
MATTIS THAT ANY DECISION ABOUT
THE POTENTIAL WITHDRAWAL OF
AMERICAN TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA
WOULD BE AN ISSUE FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
SOUTH KOREANS PRESIDENT ONLY.
THE TWO LEADERS SPOKE HOURS AGO.
THE NEXT EXERCISE COMES UP IN
AUGUST FOR MORE COMPUTER-BASED
TRAINING.

MID-90s WHEN OTHER AGREEMENTS
WERE MADE WITH NORTH KOREA.
AND IT'S NOTABLE EACH YEAR
THAILAND HOSTED AN EVEN LARGER
