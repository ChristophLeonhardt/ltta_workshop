1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
because here's the message although
Heather was a caring and compassionate

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:11,580
person so are a lot of you a lot of you
go that extra mile and I think the

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:18,090
reason that what happened to Heather has
struck a chord is because we know that

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,430
what she did is achievable we don't all
have to die we don't all have to

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,490
sacrifice our lives they tried to kill
my child to shut her up well guess what

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,349
you just magnified her

7
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:05,040
so so here's what I want to happen you
ask me what can I do so many caring

8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,040
people pages of pages of pages of stuff
I'm going through I'm reading pages of

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,710
pages of pages how she's touching the
world I want this to spread I don't want

10
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,850
this to die this is just the beginning
of Heather's legacy this is not the end

11
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:31,410
of Heather's legacy you need to find in
your heart that small spark of

12
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,649
accountability what is there that I can
do to make the world a better place what

13
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:43,289
injustice do I see and what does turn
away I don't I don't really want to get

14
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:47,039
involved in that I'm gonna want to speak
up they'll be annoyed with me my boss

15
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:52,830
might think less of me I don't care you
poke that finger at yourself like

16
00:01:52,830 --> 00:02:00,630
Heather would have done and you make it
happen you take that extra step you find

17
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,149
a way to make a difference in the world
so remember in your heart if you're not

18
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,569
outraged you're not paying attention and
I want you to pay attention find what's

19
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,099
wrong don't ignore it don't look the
other way you make a point to look at it

20
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:22,800
and say to yourself what can I do to
make a difference and that's how you're

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,209
going to make my child's death
worthwhile I'd rather have my child but

22
00:02:27,209 --> 00:00:00,000
by golly if I got to give her up we're
going to make it count
