1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,840
When people think of Vladimir Putin they think
of the capital P Power.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,260
And that’s exactly the impression he creates.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,370
Whether it’s physical power, firing different
weapons, riding in various James Bond-esque modes

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,160
of transportation, or tossing hapless opponents
in judo.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,910
Or political power.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,370
Ruling his own country with an iron fist,
crushing his political opposition, or, most

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:29,869
recently, being accused of meddling in foreign
elections for his own benefit.

8
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:35,390
This is how Vladimir Putin went from a poor,
tough kid in Leningrad, to a KGB spy, to the

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,480
very symbol of modern Russia.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,430
Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born in 1952
in Leningrad, which is now St. Petersburg.

11
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,910
His father was a factory foreman, and his
mother, a homemaker.

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,820
It’s widely said that Putin’s public-facing
tough-guy persona can be traced back to him

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,900
getting into fights when he was younger.

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,420
Which paved the way to him taking up Judo.

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,360
After getting a law degree from Leningrad
State University, Putin joined the KGB foreign

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,629
intelligence service.

17
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,740
He spent 16 years in the KGB.

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,620
When Putin returned to Russia, he began his
political career

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,920
That’s Leonid Berschidsky.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,140
Putin thrived in Sobchak’s administration
because…

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,780
Bershidsky: He was considered a pretty efficient
city official at that time.

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,490
He was very loyal to Sobchak.

23
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,140
So loyal and efficient that…

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,070
Bershidsky: He was noticed by Yeltsin’s
close circle.

25
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,980
And those people soon brought Putin over to
Moscow to work in Yeltsin’s

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,060
administration, where he quickly climbed the political ladder.

27
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,440
Trenin: Then of course he was promoted to
Prime Minister of Russia.

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,900
Around this time, Yeltsin and the people around
him, the so-called “Family”, decided that

29
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,579
Putin would become a sick Yeltsin’s successor.

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,920
And then this happened…

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,560
(Explosion)

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,880
The apartment bombings were carried
out in three Russian cities killing 293 people

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,810
and injuring more than 1,000

34
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,400
Putin immediately accused Chechen separatists
for the bombings, and followed it up with

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
action.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
And it worked.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,540
Trenin: after that he became an heir apparent in the
eyes of the Russian people.

38
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:24,879
3 months later, Yeltsin resigned.

39
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,580
And on his way out, a famous exchange.

40
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,779
Trenin: Yeltsin was getting into the car at
The Kremlin, and the last words he addressed

41
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:37,060
to Putin before getting into the car was “take
good care of Russia.”

42
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,360
So Putin took over as president, and 3 months
later won his first election.

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,969
But just because Putin won the presidency,
that didn’t mean he had all the power.

44
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:46,999
This is Michael McFaul.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,840
McFaul: I was U.S. Ambassador from 2012 to 2014.

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,060
And certain people...

47
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,000
The oligarchs.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,840
McFaul: Did better than others in that firesale,
sometimes called privatization.

49
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,030
And those people tended to be well connected
with the Yeltsin regime, and they weren’t

50
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,020
Putin’s friends.

51
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,430
Bershidsky: But they probably miscalculated
thinking they could easily find a way to influence

52
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,280
him, it became impossible almost from the
start.

53
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,080
Trenin: From that very moment it was warfare

54
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,840
between him and the
oligarchs.

55
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,740
That’s when Putin gave the oligarchs a choice…

56
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,740
Putin’s way...

57
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,100
McFaul: Some of those people from the 90s
managed to figure out a new way of

58
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:33,909
Or prison…

59
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:38,440
McFaul: Others could not find common vision
and so they lost their assets.

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,920
Khodorkovsky once was Russia's richest person worth $15 billion

61
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,280
but he ran afoul of President Putin and he spent a decade in prison

62
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,240
With domestic power consolidated

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,880
Putin focused on
restoring Russia's global influence

64
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,920
Bershidsky: Putin is the guy who believes
in the expansionist Russian state.

65
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,620
Georgia and Ukraine and all the other Soviet
republics that split off when the Soviet Union

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,119
fell apart, he still believes that they’re
traditional Russian satellites.

67
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,539
And he used annexation and invasion, as well
as oil, gas, and trade to keep former Soviet

68
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,389
Republics in Russia’s orbit.

69
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,980
In 2008 Putin’s two terms were up and he
decided to step down as president…

70
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,200
Dmitri Medvedev was elected and

71
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,479
Putin went back to Prime Minister but really….

72
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,039
Trenin: Putin never left power.

73
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:39,180
Bershidsky: He continued running the country
and Medvedev was a bit of a figurehead.

74
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,560
There was actually a period of cooperation
between Russia and the U.S. that benefited

75
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,580
both countries during Medvedev’s presidency.

76
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,699
McFaul: Cuz Medvedev did not have the same
negative attitude toward the west as Putin

77
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:51,699
did.

78
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,440
But when Putin came back to run for a third
term.

79
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,140
In the lead-up to the 2012 election, it was
widely believed that both the presidential

80
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,020
and parliamentary elections were rigged, and
Russians took to the streets.

81
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,930
Putin blamed the protests squarely on America,
and more specifically, Secretary of State

82
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,920
Hillary Clinton.

83
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,380
McFaul: He believes that she had sent what
he said “a signal” to demonstrators

84
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,320
Still Putin won by a huge margin, and 
set about crushing the protest movement immediately

85
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,120
upon his return to the Kremlin.

86
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,699
Over the next few years, Russia’s economy
tumbled; Putin annexed Crimea, leading to

87
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:32,480
sanctions; the price of oil fell drastically; the ruble
hit a new low; and America played down Russia’s

88
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,600
influence, with Obama calling Russia

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
Obama: A regional power.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,060
Despite all of that -- Putin’s approval
rating remained sky high.

91
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,919
And then an opportunity for payback.

92
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,840
Trump: I think I’d get along very well with
Vladimir Putin.

93
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,560
McFaul: In 2016 there was one candidate who
called Vladimir Putin very smart.

94
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,200
Trump exhibited tolerance towards Putin’s
actions annexing Crimea.

95
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,940
And similar views on NATO,
and sanctions.

96
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,340
McFaul: Secretary Clinton didn’t support
any of those views.

97
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,240
Even though Putin denies any wrongdoing

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,340
Putin: U.S. elections? I don't know.

99
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,840
The U.S. has accused Russia of being behind the

100
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,280
leaking of 20,000 Democratic National Committee
emails, which many say helped Trump beat Hillary

101
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,499
Clinton in the presidential election.

102
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:19,780
Which leaves us here, with the possibility
of a President Putin until 2024, positioning

103
00:06:19,780 --> 00:00:00,000
Russia to be the world power he always imagined
it should be.
