remember when Donald Trump loved harley-davidson well now Donald Trump has done serious damage to that company and I don't just mean a nasty tweet the day after his inauguration when President Trump saw the largest inauguration protests in history in Washington and in every one of the 50 states and around the world he was afraid and his White House staff was afraid they were afraid to send him out into America where whatever he wanted to say might be drowned out by protesters and that is why president Trump's staff canceled his visit to Wisconsin to the Harley Davidson plant there in the second week of his presidency and so Donald Trump invited Harley Davidson executives to the White House to celebrate our iconic motorcycle manufacturer the president used the opportunity to tell a lie about the history of the company saying that in the early 1980s Harley Davidson was drowning completely because of unfair competition from foreign motorcycle manufacturers the president said the foreign manufacturers especially the Japanese were dumping motorcycles now dumping doesn't sound like a technical term but it actually is an international trade it means selling a product in a foreign market for less than it costs to manufacture that product but the truth is Harley Davidson which in 1920 was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world was by 1980 the only American motorcycle manufacturer and Harley Davidson made the worst motorcycle sold in the American market then Japanese motorcycles were better and German milk German built BMWs were much better I owned a couple of British motorcycles in those days a BSA and a Norton that's the BSA on the left there of your screen that's actually in Northern Ireland and the blue one on the right is the Norton which was really one of my favorites until I totaled it in a very high-speed accident near Boston which I was lucky to walk away from and owning British motorcycles in those days meant that I was willing to put up with a little bit of oil leaking here and there but I would would not owning a harley-davidson then because they leaked a lot of oil all over the place all the time you had to be a very good mechanic to own a Harley in those days the Japanese bikes in the BMW they didn't wreak they didn't leak a drop of oil they were brilliantly engineered machines the same was true in the American automobile market in the 1980s American cars were mostly junk then and Japanese cars and German cars were much higher quality and here's how the CEO of Harley Davidson described that period in Harley's history when it was on its way out of business for years we tried to figure out why the Japanese were beating us so badly first we thought it was their culture then we thought it was 'awesome a ssin then we thought it was dumping finally we realized the problem was us not them and so Harley designers and engineers actually studied the Japanese manufacturing model to figure out how to make a better motorcycle and they did and by the late 1980s when Harley Davidsons finally stopped leaking oil I bought my first harley-davidson and then traded that one in for another Harley and have never looked back at foreign motorcycles harley-davidson is a strong company again making a great product not despite international competition but because of international competition the Japanese and the Germans forced the Americans to make a better motorcycle and the Americans rose to that challenge if you're driving an American car tonight you are driving a better car because of international competition because the Japanese and the Germans have forced American cars to be better much better ten years ago I traded in a BMW for a Ford Fusion and haven't had a foreign car since imagine how bad American cars would be now if they never had to rise to the challenge of competition from high quality Japanese and German cars Donald Trump understands none of that to him international trade has no complexities and no prising unanticipated consequences if Donald Trump tried to go to the harley-davidson engine factory in Wisconsin today or the harley-davidson final assembly plant in New York Pennsylvania today there would be protests but they would be protest by people working at harley-davidson who will now lose their jobs because of Donald Trump the European Union which is harley-davidsons single largest foreign market has imposed new tariffs on American motorcycles which is to say on harley-davidson in retaliation to the illegal tariffs that Donald Trump has imposed on Europe with the false claim that those tariffs are to protect our national security Harley Davidsons corporate response to the new high European tariffs on motorcycles made in America is to simply move some of their manufacturing capacity to foreign countries so that harley-davidson sold in Europe would not be Harley Davidsons made in the USA and they will therefore avoid the Trump tariffs and sell at a competitive price in Europe and that means Harley Davidson will cut its manufacturing capacity in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in order to increase its manufacturing capacity in foreign countries so Donald Trump's tariffs have succeeded already in only one thing in sending Harley Davidson jobs out of the United States exactly the opposite of what Donald Trump wants to do Donald Trump once famously said that nobody knew that health care could be so complicated of course everyone knew health care could be so complicated only Donald Trump didn't know and the only thing that I ever encountered when I was working in government that is more complicated than the health care system is our system of international trade which is filled with unintended consequences and counterintuitive outcomes that Donald Trump is incapable of anticipating or understanding the stock market spent the day in decline today because of this kind of news about the Trump tariffs from Harley Davidson Harley Davidson stock ended the day 6% lower than it began the day so if you're a harley-davidson worker with harley-davidson stock in your retirement fund every hundred dollars worth of harley-davidson stock that you woke up with this morning is now worth ninety four dollars thanks to Donald Trump there is no one working at a Harley Davidson assembly line who doesn't understand international trade better than the President of the United States thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of
