President Donald Trump has previously called the news media the country's worst enemy but offered his condolences journalists like all Americans should be free from the fear of being violently attacked while doing their job the community's memorial for the slain newspaper workers grows by the hour but perhaps the one memorial that speaks loudest of all is one with very few words this nearly blank opinion page published in the capital Gazette with a simple sentence today we are speechless howdy Joe Castro al jazeera Annapolis Maryland
