BECAUSE THEY SAID THE SENATE DID NOT REQUEST THAT. BRIAN: LET'S BRING IN DEAN CAIN NOW. I'M SURE YOU KNOW ON ANOTHER NOTE THERE ARE HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES LENA DUNHAM IS ONE: THEY ARE GOING TO PROTEST OUTSIDE. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL AFFECT THE DECISION AT ALL. I'M THINKING IT WILL NOT EFFECT THE DECISION. WHY DIDN'T THEY CALL ME? BRIAN: I HAVE NO IDEA. I DON'T GET IT. SAME SORT OF THING THAT HAPPENED IN THE ELECTIONS. NOBODY. BRIAN: THERE IS MELISSA MILANO. I COULDN'T WATCH THE HEARINGS WITHOUT SEEING HER THERE THE ENTIRE TIME. I UNDERSTAND THEY WANT TO PROTEST. WHAT ARE THEY PROTESTING? IT'S ANTI-TRUMP. THAT'S REALLY ALL IT COMES DOWN TO. AINSLEY: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT? BECAUSE MOST OF HOLLYWOOD IS ANTI-TRUMP. EVEN ALL OF THIS GOING ON ISN'T ANTI-KAVANAUGH, IT'S ANTI-TRUMP. THEY ARE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE PRESIDENT TO HAVE HIS NOMINEE IN THERE IF HE IF HE NOMINATED MERRICK GARLAND. THEY WOULD BE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING. IT'S KAVANAUGH. I THINK IT'S A DELAY TACTIC. THE WHOLE THINGS IS A DELAY TACTIC. IT'S AWFUL. IT STOPS GOOD PEOPLE YOU THINK ABOUT IT WHO WANTS TO GO IN THERE AND GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND HAVE EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE OVERTURNED AND HAVE A SPURLESS ACCUSATION COME UP THAT YOU CAN'T REFUTE. BRIAN: IS HE YOUR AGE? ARE YOU SAYING I'M OLD? STEVE: YOU COULD BE ON THE SUPREME COURT. I CAN'T DEFEND MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK. I DON'T THINK SO. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S IN THAT. AINSLEY: WHAT ABOUT YOUR SON? YOU HAVE A SON. WHAT DO YOU TELL HIM THIS OPEN DIALOGUE? I TELL HIM ABOUT THE THINGS YOU COULD DO AND MISTAKES YOU COULD MAKE AS A YOUNG MAN THAT COULD HAUNT YOU FOREVER NOW. IT'S DIFFERENT NOW BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE STUFF ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ALL THOSE THINGS. CAN YOU GO BACK AND CHECK HIS TWITTER. YOU CAN'T CHECK JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S TWITTER FROM WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE IT DIDN'T EXIST. IT'S THAT SORT OF A THING. ALL THAT STUFF OUT THERE NOW. YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. I TELL HIM THAT ALL THE TIME. TERRIFYING TIME FOR ANYBODY THAT YOU THINK ANYTHING YOU HAVE DONE COULD BE AN ACCUSATION THAT YOU CAN'T REFUTE. AND IT STICKS IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION. STEVE: A WEEK AGO BEFORE THEY GOT THE SUPPLEMENTAL BALL GOING, EVERY DEMOCRAT HAD ALREADY COME OUT AND SAID I'M GOING TO VOTE AGAINST HIM BASED ON POLICY OR WHATEVER. IT WASN'T BASED ON POLICY. STEVE: ULTIMATELY, THAT'S A LOT LIKE HOLLYWOOD. THEY ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MIND REGARDING HIM BASED ON POLITICS? BASED ON JUST THE FACT THAT HE IS TRUMP. THAT'S IT. THEY ARE ANTI-TRUMP. THIS FBI REPORT THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT AND THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GO IN THERE AND READ ONE BY ONE WILL CHANGE NO ONE'S MIND. I WILL QUOTE JOE BIDEN THE FBI DOES NOT REACH CONCLUSIONS AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO REACH CONCLUSIONS. THEY ARE GOING TO ASK FOR MORE INVESTIGATIONS. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET IT, HE FILED CLOTURE LAST NIGHT. THEY HAVE A VOTE AND HE WILL GET CONFIRMED OR NOT. A LOT OF THIS WILL HOPEFULLY BE FORGOTTEN. IT'S REALLY A CIRCUS, THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS BECOME A CIRCUS. STEVE: WHO DOES THIS ENERGIZE? BECAUSE WE WERE TALKING TO A POLSTER EARLIER WHO SAID THE SO-CALLED BRETT BOUNCE IS REAL. IT'S ENERGIZING REPUBLICAN VOTERS. THE IDEA IT'S GOING TO BE A WHETHER BLWHETHER BLUEETHER BLUE WHER BLUE WAVR BLUE WAVE BUT POSSIBLY NOT. THE DEMOCRATS' BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN SO BAD DURING THIS CONFIRMATION HEARING PERHAPS IT WILL ENERGIZE REPUBLICANS. BRIAN: LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED OVER THOSE HOURS OF TESTIMONY AND SAY HE CAME OUT PARTISAN BECAUSE SOMETHING HILLARY CLINTON WAS BEHIND. AND HE CAME OUT VERY ANGRY BECAUSE OF THE SARCASTIC RETORTS TO THESE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE BEEN TARGETING HIM BEHIND HIS BACK OR IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA. DID HE MAKE A MISTAKE WITH THOSE TWO THINGS? NO MATTER WHAT HE DID, HE WAS GOING TO GET VILIFIED. IT DIDN'T MATTER. HE STAYED STOIC, IT WOULD BE NO EMOTION. HE WAS A ROBOT. DOOMED IF YOU DO OR DON'T. HE WAS IN TROUBLE EITHER WAY. THEY CHOSE FOR HIM TO HAVE A BIG VOCIFEROUS DEFENSE. OKAY IS HE TOO EMOTIONAL AND DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TEMPERAMENT. EVEN THOUGH HE HAS BEEN ON THE COURT FOR 12 YEARS ALREADY. AINSLEY: GULCH DIDN'T EXPERIENCE THIS BECAUSE HE IS NOT THE SWING VOTE. MANY ARE WORRIED ABOUT ROE V. WADE AND HOW CLAUSEN VOTE ON THAT AND OVERTURN IT THAT BRINGS US TO YOUR MOVIE. GOSNELL. AINSLEY: WE HAVE A CLIP. LET'S WATCH THAT AND TALK ABOUT IT? EXCELLENT. LOOKING FOR ANYTHING THAT LOOKS LIKE DRUGS OR PARAPHERNALIA. PHILADELPHIA POLICE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE A SEARCH WARRANT. WHAT IS THAT SMELL? MAN, HAVE YOU GOT TO SEE THIS. IS THIS NORMAL? NO, I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN AN ABORTION CLINIC BEFORE. THAT IS IN THE CITY OF PHILLY IT MADE HEADLINES A COUPLE YEARS AGO. I HEARD ONE OF THE ADS FOR THAT THAT MAN IS ACCUSED OF BEING ONE OF THE BIGGEST SERIAL KILLERS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. I ASKED SHOWING THE CLIP DID YOU REMEMBER HEARING THIS? SHE SAID I DON'T REALLY. AINSLEY: WHO WHAT YEAR WAS IT? 2012. NOBODY COVERED IT IT'S ABORTION. IT'S A BAD WORD. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GET IN THERE AND TALK ABOUT IT. AINSLEY: TOUGH SUBJECT TO COVER. OBVIOUSLY IT HAS A LOT VARYING WHAT'S GOING ON NOW POSSIBLY WITH THE SUPREME COURT. THIS GUY WAS DOING LATE TERM ABORTIONS AFTER 24 WEEKS. KILLING LIVE BABIES. WE DON'T SHOW ALL THAT IN THE FILM. THE FILM ISN'T GRUESOME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THERE IS HE THERE. HE IS IN JAIL FOR THREE COUNTS OF MURDER AND ONE FOR INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. THE GUY WAS A MONSTER OF SORTS. BUT HE DOESN'T COME OFF LIKE A MONSTER. HE WOULD BE THE NICEST GUY. BRIAN, SO NICE TO SEE YOU. AINSLEY, PLEASURE. MIGHT TOUCH YOUR KNEE AND TRY TO CHARM YOU. BRIAN: WATCH VIDEO OF HIM. YEAH. AINSLEY: LATE TERM SIX MONTHS. HE WAS HAVING THEM BORN AT 24 WEEKS, 26 WEEKS, YOU HAVE A 90% CHANCE OF THAT FETUS SURVIVING HE WAS ACTUALLY INDUCING LABOR AND KILLING LIVE CHILDREN. AWFUL. STEVE: THAT'S WHY THE AD I MENTIONED REFERRED TO HIM AS THE LARGEST SERIAL KILLER OR MASS MURDERER IN HISTORY. BUT, YOU KNOW, ABORTION IS LEGAL IN THE COUNTRY BUT HE WAS NOT OPERATING LEGALLY. NO. HE WAS DOING IT AFTER 24 WEEKS IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA AND THAT'S SIX MONTHS. HE WAS INDUCING THE LABOR. INSTEAD OF DOING THE PAINSTAKING WORK THAT THEY NORMALLY DO FOR THAT PROCEDURE, HE WOULD INDUCE LABOR, HAVE A LIVE BABY. AINSLEY: MOM DECIDED AFTER SIX MONTH DIDN'T WANT A BABY. SOME WOMEN CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN AND TAKE THEM IN A HEART BEAT. THAT'S THE TOUGH THING. IT'S TAUGHT THAT MAYBE HE DID THREE OR FOUR OF THOSE A DAY. AINSLEY: WOW. IT DIDN'T GET COVERED. PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO IT I HOPE PEOPLE GO OUT AND WATCH THE MOVIE. IT'S CONTROVERSIAL. WE HAD A HARD TIME GETTING IT OUT THERE. BRIAN: IT HITS THEATERS NATIONWIDE OCTOBER 12TH.
