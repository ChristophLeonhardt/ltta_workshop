The environment outside the habitat 
is very barren.
There's very little vegetation, very 
little in the way of life, really.
It doesn't offer the sensory variety that 
the world back home offers.
You don't have traffic. You don't have
the sounds of other people.
You’re just here and that's it.
Putting the VR on, having been in here
for five months, is strange.
It's so overwhelming to have 
that much sensory input
that you haven’t had for five months.
As soon as you put the VR headset on, 
you kind of really get sucked into
this kind of different world and forget 
that you’re in a dome
on the side of a volcano.
It is sometimes easy to forget 
where you actually are
and that's a really interesting feeling
to sort of be nowhere.
It's just you there.
Maybe you're sitting alone in a forest.
Or maybe you're sitting 
alone in a city park.
You don't have to think about 
the five other people
that you're in the habitat with, and you 
don't have to hear them or see them.
You really get a chance to feel like 
you're alone. It's just yours.
And that feeling is pretty rare because, 
in here, you’re never truly alone.
