1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,580
Male fiddler crabs are lopsided.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,910
Females have two claws
of about the same size.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,650
Males have one regular size
claw and one outsized claw,

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,300
really outsized.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,690
“The other is huge, it's greatly
enlarged to the point

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,590
that it can be approximately
half of his body weight.”

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,090
They use the large claw for
fighting, communicating

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,620
and courtship.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,340
That little mud-colored crab
getting all the attention,

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,130
that’s the female.

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,870
Yes, females do prefer
males with larger claws.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,090
But they also care
about how males

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,800
wave those big
claws when they’re

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,900
trying to attract mates.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,290
They prefer faster waving,
probably because it indicates

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,510
a more fit potential mate.

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,780
That was shown very clearly
in an earlier experiment

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,330
when a robot claw left living
crabs struggling to keep up.

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,170
But as scientists in Australia
found out in a new experiment,

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,140
also using robot
claws, females prefer

21
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,780
males that accelerate
their waving when

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,850
they see a female approach.

23
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,250
“So we had robot replica
males that we could then

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,950
program to either escalate,
as if they are increasing

25
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,000
their signaling
effort, or de-escalate

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,400
as if they’re getting fatigued.”

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Sure enough, faced with
a choice of robot claws,

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,310
females notice the
acceleration and preferred it.

29
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,220
That’s if they were
even paying attention.

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,130
To be fair, that’s not
the robot claw’s fault.

31
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,510
The very same thing
happens with real crabs.

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:00:00,000
Better luck next time.
