IRAN AND WE BEGIN WITH JOHN ROBERTS ON THE MAJOR MOVEMENT OF NORTH KOREA. GOOD EVENING. AS HE WAS BOARDING AIR FORCE ONE ON HIS WAY TO A CAMPAIGN RALLY THIS AFTERNOON, PRESIDENT TRUMP PREDICTED THAT HIS PENDING SETTLEMENT WITH NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN WOULD BE A "GREAT SUCCESS." THE CHANCES OF IT ACTUALLY HAPPENING WERE GREATLY ENHANCED BY THE FACT THAT NORTH KOREA RELEASED THE THREE REMAINING AMERICAN PRISONERS THAT THEY WERE HOLDING. IT WAS JUST AFTER 3:00 IN THE MORNING THAT THE THREE AMERICANS DID OBTAIN NORTH KOREA TOUCHED DOWN IN JOINT BASE ANDREWS, THE VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND THE FIRST LADY WERE ALL ON HOME TO WELCOME THEM HOME. CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING IN THIS COUNTRY. THE GOODWILL GESTURE WAS ENOUGH TO SEAL THE DEAL ON A TRUMP-KIM SUMMIT. THE PRESIDENTS WEEDING THE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED MEETING BETWEEN KIM JONG UN AND MYSELF WILL TAKE PLACE IN SINGAPORE ON JUNE 12TH, WE WILL BOTH TRY TO MAKE IT A VERY SPECIAL MOMENT FOR WORLD PEACE. THE DATE CARRIES HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE BRIDGE JUNE 12TH 1987 THAT RONALD REAGAN GAVE A SPEECH IN WEST GERMANY. A SPEECH THAT SET THE STAGE FOR THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION. MR. GORBACHEV TEAR DOWN THIS WALL. WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY THE CHOICE OF JUNE 12TH WAS SIMPLY A COINCIDENCE. BUT AS PRESIDENT REAGAN FOUND, PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES THAT KIM JONG UN WILL WANT TO CHOOSE A PATH OUT OF ISOLATION. I REALLY THINK THAT HE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING. I THINK THAT HE DID THIS BECAUSE HE REALLY WANTS TO DO SOMETHING, AND BRING THE COUNTRY INTO THE REAL WORLD. IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP HIM MOVING TOWARDS THE BARGAINING TABLE, DROPPING THE HARSH RHETORIC OF LITTLE ROCKET MAN, GOING SO FAR TO PRAISE HIM FOR RELEASING THE DETAINEES. I WANT TO THANK KIM JONG UN WHO REALLY WAS EXCELLENT TO WITH THE THREE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THE COMPLEMENT BROUGHT SHARP CRITICISM FROM THE SENATE MINORITY LEADER. THE EXULTATION OF THE GREATNESS OF NORTH KOREA DOING THIS EVADES ME. WE CANNOT BE FOOLED INTO GIVING THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME CREDIT. FOR RETURNING AMERICANS THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN DETAINED IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN RESPONSE TO CHUCK SCHUMER, THE HOUSE SPEAKER SAID, GIVE THE PRESIDENT A BREAK. HE IS PREPARING FOR A SUMMIT WITH THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA TO FOCUS ON DENUCLEARIZATION. WE SHOULD GIVE HIM SOME LEEWAY. WHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP LIKED THE IDEA OF THE DMZ WHERE KIM AND SOUTH KOREA'S PRESIDENT MATZ, SINGAPORE WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST CHOICE OF THE. CLOSE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO GET TO WITH THE LIMITED FLEET OF AIRCRAFT AT THE NEUTRAL TERRITORY. A CITY RENOWNED FOR EXCELLENT SECURITY. JUST ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE SUMMONS, SINGAPORE HOSTS AN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CONFERENCE WHERE DELEGATES COME FROM ALL OVER THE INDO PACIFIC INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES TO TALK ABOUT MUTUAL SECURITY NEEDS. SO I THINK THAT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. IT IS AN IDEAL LOCATION. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD HIS EYE ON DOMESTIC ISSUES TODAY, SPECIFICALLY THE FARM BILL IN THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING TODAY WITH THE AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SONNY PURDUE, PAT ROBERTS OF KANSAS, AND MIKE CONAWAY. THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE EXPECTS WHEN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL IS DRAFTED THAT IT WILL INCLUDE MEASURES THAT WOULD REQUIRE WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON FOOD STAMPS. THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE EXPECTS SAID TO BE IN THE LEGISLATION, HE STOPPED SHORT OF ISSUING WHAT WAS EXPECTED TO BE A VETO TREND. Bret: THERE IS A STORY IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" HEADLINED NORTH SECURITY CLOSE TO RESIGNING AFTER TRUMP BERATED HER AND TALKS ABOUT AN INCIDENT, WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THAT? WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT IN THE CABINET MEETING YESTERDAY, I HAVE CONFIRMED THIS THROUGH SOURCES, KIRSTJEN NIELSEN FELT LIKE SHE WAS SINGLED OUT AND PARADED BY THE PRESIDENT OVER WHAT HE SAW AS A LACK OF BORDER SECURITY. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORT SAYS THAT SHE WAS CLOSE TO RESIGNING OVER IT AND THAT SHE HAD DRAFTED A LETTER OF RESIGNATION. WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM SOURCES AT DHS IS THAT A TWEET WILL BE COMING SOON. THAT WOULD DENY THE EXISTENCE OF A RESIGNATION LETTER. IT MAY BE THAT SHE WAS SAYING SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF WELL, IF I'M NOT DOING A GOOD JOB, MAYBE I SHOULD NOT BE IN THIS JOB. BUT AS FAR AS DRAFTING A FORMAL RESIGNATION LETTER, THAT APPEARS TO NOT BE THE CASE AT LEAST
