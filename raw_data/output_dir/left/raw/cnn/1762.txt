1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,509
we liftoff from San Juan a route Stephen
has flown hundreds of times but this is

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,300
the scariest sky traffic he's ever seen

3
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:21,090
the airport's have no working radar so
every slow Cessna and every fast jet is

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:31,590
flying by sight in a dust filled sky we
cross over resorts and neighborhoods all

5
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,590
shattered by Maria and eight miles later
touched down amid shattered airplanes as

6
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,059
some of the first outsiders to reach via
'kiss since the storm it just picked up

7
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,280
by Maria and thrown here and look at
these over on this side

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,649
broken planes are just the first signs
of Maria's strength the entire island is

9
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:59,280
ravaged in the swanky w hotel to the
boats of mosquito Bay that is the cabin

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,110
of a catamaran for tourists called the
naughty mermaid and if it looks a little

11
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:12,180
bit odd it's because it's flipped upside
down by what the locals say were 200

12
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,150
mile an hour winds 3 2 1

13
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,460
in happier times the glow-in-the-dark
plankton that lives in this Bay helps

14
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,260
lure the tours that drive the economy
there is no salvaging the upcoming high

15
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:34,310
season but that is a worry for later
right now is about survival we out of

16
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,320
food we're running out of food and water

17
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,910
that is the kind of heartbreaking sold
raining scene that's getting played out

18
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:49,400
again and again as people look at her
cry as she gets on a Sat phone for the

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,340
first time

20
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,780
it crushes your soul to watch that and
this is the line this is a two-hour line

21
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:09,910
of folks waiting to give proof of life
to a wife or a husband or a father it's

22
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,150
rough

23
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:21,379
how's that feel
can I see your eyes can you move your

24
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:27,390
yeah it's this tough need out you know
so go back and tell that's why I'm here

25
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,659
brother back and tell them we need help
you tell the friends day

26
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,099
Tom aren't you I lost everything after
the storm blew through you flew down

27
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,879
here with a bag of satellite bomb Burt
first light we had a lot of folks in the

28
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,120
u.s. that were stepping up and
contributing and we decided the most

29
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,519
important thing was to establish
communication because we weren't hearing

30
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,709
from anybody
when is help coming i mooch off based on

31
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,250
that game there are a lot of people who
have promised to bring supplies but it

32
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,079
hasn't arrived yet the deputy mayor
tells me red tape seems to be their

33
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:07,709
biggest enemy relief efforts and hate
someone may be coming we're here and

34
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,209
we're trying to get those coordination
those clearances those orders to be

35
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,540
issued so we can get them because the
aisle and it's feeling this type of

36
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,849
pressure yeah and the tensions are
running high do you feel American had

37
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,230
moments like this do you feel neglected
in moments like this somewhere in

38
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,590
between I think I think we have to take
a deep breath and say you know we are US

39
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,430
citizens it's been a hundred years since
Woodrow Wilson in 1917 made us US

40
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,280
citizens it should mean something
and right now we are forgotten Island

41
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,919
and that shouldn't be for years the US
Navy used this island for target

42
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,109
practice until the locals got fed up a
better way to make it up to them by

43
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:53,250
storming the beaches with aid instead of
bombs this is something that needs and

44
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,750
requires someone who knows how to
distribute boots in the middle of almost

45
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,410
a warzone so you're making a plea for
martial law I am making a plea for

46
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,660
martial law I'm making a plea for for
having three four five days where we can

47
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,680
distribute these in what we can
distribute water we can give food I mean

48
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,489
it's been six days after the hurricane
and it's just a horrible scenario in

49
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,180
Puerto Rico I just did you tell my mom
okay different number Brittany moved

50
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,260
