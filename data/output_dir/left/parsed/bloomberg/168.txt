HERE WITH ME TO DISCUSS MORE
ABOUT CARS AND TECH IS ALEX

WHAT YOU MAKE OF WHAT HE SAID?
A LOT OF THE REACTION HAS BEEN
OTHER COMPANIES STRIKING BIG
DEALS AND THIS IS STILL SMALL
POTATOES.
ALEX: ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE THE
INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY WHICH
ALLOWS YOU TO DO THE AUTONOMOUS
DRIVING AND THE RIDESHARING.
THE THING WE HAVE SEEN, THE BIG
COMPETITORS, THEY INVESTED IN
TECHNOLOGY AND FORM OF CRUISE
AUTOMATION.
REPORTEDLY AS MUCH AS $1 BILLION
OR LESS.
THEN THEY HAVE ALSO INVESTED IN
RIDESHARING COMPANIES.
THEY SUNK $500 MILLION IN TWO
LYFT L -- INTO LYFT.
FORD IS FOCUSED ON THE
TECHNOLOGY TO DO IN AUTONOMOUS
VEHICLE.
CLEARLY ALL THESE BIG
RIDESHARING COMPANY'S ARE
BURNING TO CASH AT A PRECIPITOUS
PACE.
PERHAPS MAYBE THAT THE REASON
THEY DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT

WHEN IT COMES TO READ THESE
THINGS ARE STARTING TO MAKE
MONEY AND TURN BIG PROFITS, FORD
WILL HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND.
EMILY: HE SAID IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT TO FIGURE OUT WHO
HOLDS THE KEYS TO THE CUSTOMERS,
WHO CONTROLS THE RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE CUSTOMER.
I SENSED A BIT OF HESITANCE AND
WORKING WITH APPLE OR GOOGLE OR
ANY OF THESE OTHER PLAYERS.
ALEX: ONE OF THE BIG PARTS
ANNOUNCED SAID THE ARE GOING TO
PROVIDE SOME VEHICLES TO GOOGLE.
THE CEO WAS SENSITIVE AND SAID
WE ARE NOT JUST GOING TO BE
BASHING METAL FOR GOOGLE TO GET
ALL THE VALUE CREATION.
METHINKS THE GENTLEMAN DOTH
PROTEST TOO MUCH.
ALL THE VALUATION IS AN SOFTWARE
WHICH IS HIGHLY PROFITABLE THAT
COMES FROM GOOGLE OR APPLE.
AND THE LOW-MARGIN BUILDING OF
CARS IS DONE BY THE CLASSIC OEM.
EMILY: BUT FIAT CHRYSLER IS
DOING THE DEAL.
ALEX: THE DIFFERENCE IS FIAT
DOESN'T HAVE THE CASH RESERVES
AND THE ABILITY TO RAISE DEBT AS
READILY AS ORDERED OR GENERAL
MOTORS.
IT IS HARD TO THROUGH A HUGE
AMOUNT OF MONEY IN RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT.
FORD IS BACKING ITSELF AND WE
CAN HAVE THE CASH TO GO INTO THE
SPACE OF A WANT TO.
HOW MANY PLAYERS ARE THERE OF
ANY SIGNIFICANT SCALE IN THE
RIDESHARING SPACE?

INVESTMENTS FROM CARMAKERS.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLIES
TO BOTH TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES.

SECURITIES INDUSTRY FOR

EXCITING, ESPECIALLY FOR CERTAIN
VERTICAL SEGMENTS OF THE HOME
SUCH AS WATCHING YOUNG KIDS AND
OLDER PEOPLE.
WE ALSO THINK ROBOTICS AND

PART OF THE REASON IT IS

BEEN COMPETING WITH THEM
IMPRESSIVELY.
IT IS A GOOD CHANCE REGULATORS
WILL GIVE THIS APPROVAL.
EMILY: DO YOU THINK THE
ANTI-MONOPOLY BOARD IN CHINA
WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THIS?
AREN'T THEY REQUIRED TO COME IN
UNDER OUR DEALS INVOLVING
COMPANIES WITH MORE THAN $60
MILLION IN REVENUE?
WHICH YOU WOULD ASSUME DIDI
MAKES.
PETER: DEPENDS ON HOW THEY
DEFINED THE REVENUE AND HOW THEY
REPORT THAT REVENUE.
REGULATORS ARE GOING TO LOOK AT
THIS.
IT IS TOO HIGH PROFILE DEAL.
IT INVOLVES THERE HE HIGH
PROFILE NAMES IN THE COUNTRY.
THEY WILL LOOK AT IT.
ONE OF THE REGULATORS SAID THEY
DID MADE -- THEY DO NEED TO MAKE
AN APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL.
THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE WILL
LOOK AT IT.
THE ANTI-MONOPOLY BUREAU.
CHINA IS A COMPA -- COUNTRY
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS USED TO
REGULATING BIG COMPANIES.
IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE UNITED
STATES WHEN IT WITH THEIR
FREEWHEELING COMPETITION IN THE
PRIVATE SECTOR.
THE GOVERNMENT IS MORE
COMFORTABLE REGULATING
BUSINESSES ONCE THEY GET A BIG
SHARE OF THE MARKET.
YOU CAN SEE A REGULATOR APPROVED
THE DEAL AND WATCH PRICING
CLOSELY TO SEE WHETHER THEY ARE
TRYING TO GALS CONSUMERS.
INDICATES -- THEN THERE COULD BE
SOME ACTION.
EMILY: TALK ABOUT THE ROLE
SUBSIDIES PLAY IN THE MARKET.
PETER: THE TWO COMPANIES WERE
QUITE VOCAL ABOUT THE FACT THAT
ONE REASON FOR THIS MERGER IS
THEY WERE SUBSIDIZING THEIR
BUSINESSES SO MUCH.
THEY WERE OFFERING SUBSIDIES
BOTH TO RIDERS AND DRIVERS.
RIDERS SO THEY WOULD TRY THE
SERVICES AND TAKE THAT INSTEAD
OF A CAB OR PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION.
AND THE DRIVERS WOULD COME ON
BOARD AND GIVE UBER MORE DRIVERS
IN A CERTAIN AREA OR D MORE
DRIVERS -- DIDI MORE DRIVERS.
ALSO REGULATORS HAVE, AND SAID
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A MARKET
DRIVEN LARGELY BY SUBSIDIES.
THEY SEE THAT AS A DISTORTION OF
THE MARKET.
THEY COULD PULL RIDERS AWAY FROM
A WHILE AND CAPITAL FROM AREAS
THAT ARE MORE SUSTAINABLE FROM A
PROFIT STANDPOINT.
EMILY: PETER L STREMME FROM
TOKYO, THAT HE SO MUCH FOR THAT
UPDATE.
TURNING TO GERMANY WHERE BLACK
LANE HAS JUST CLOSED HIS LARGEST
FUNDING ROUND TO DATE.
IT WAS LED BY DAIMLER, MAKER OF
MERCEDES-BENZ.
THEY RECENTLY MERGED THEIR OWN
RIGHT HAILING SAY THIS --
SERVICE.
CAROLYN HAS MORE FROM BERLIN.
CAROLYN: MORE FLOODING IN FOR
THE MOBILITY SPACE.
IT IS A LIMOUSINE APP CALLED
BLACK LANE.
IT IS ALREADY SCALED 200 CITIES.
THEY JUST RAISED MORE THAN 10
MILLION EUROS.
THEY THAT THIS ROUND OF
INVESTMENT I TIME WHERE, THE
OWNER OF MERCEDES-BENZ.
THE CAR GIANT BASE HERE IN
GERMANY SAID RAISING FUNDS
SCALES FURTHER TO IMPROVE THE
APP.
THEY HAVE BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT
THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND
HOW THEY ARE COMPETITIVE TO UBER
AND COEXIST.
THE CEO SPOKE TO US HERE IN
BERLIN.
>> WE ARE INVESTING INTO THE
CUSTOMERS.
WE ARE BUILDING OUR TECHNOLOGIES
AROUND THE DRIVER EXPERIENCE AND
ALSO THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.
OUR DRIVERS ON AVERAGE IS
EXTREMELY FRAGMENTED.
TWO CARS ON AVERAGE THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD.
IT'S A VERY CROWDED SPACE IT
NEEDS TO BE CONSOLIDATED SO WE
ARE HEAVILY RELYING ON
TECHNOLOGY TO DO SO.
ON THE CUSTOMER SIDE WITH
IMPROVED PRESENTATIONS, EASIER
BOOKING, AND INTEGRATED
FOLLOWING OUR CUSTOMERS WERE
EVER THEY GO.
ON ONE HAND DIGITALLY, WHETHER
YOU BOOK YOU TRAVEL.
ARE YOU SEARCHING ON AN AIRLINE
SITE, ON AN ONLINE TRAVEL AGENCY
SITE?
WHERE YOU TYPICALLY BOOK YOUR
FLIGHT AND HOTEL IS WHAT THEY
WANT TO BE PRESENT TO FILL THE
DOOR TO DOOR CIRCLE.
THE ONE PIECE, AND THE OTHER IS
THE PHYSICAL EXTERIORS.
WE FOLLOW OUR CUSTOMERS WHEREVER
THEY GO.
WE WANT TO BE THERE.
WE HAVE LAUNCHED IN OVER 50
COUNTRIES, 200 AIRPORTS AND
CONTINUE TO DO SO.
CAROLYN: DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE
U.S. COMPANY'S FRUSTRATION WITH
REGULATIONS IN EUROPE?
>> YES AND NO.
THERE ARE REGULATIONS IN PLACE
AND HAVE A GOOD REASON FOR BEING
IN PLACE BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD
FOR THE SAFETY OF CUSTOMERS AND
DRIVERS.
ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ARE
COMPETITION LIMITING
REGULATIONS.
PRETTY OLD ONES.
THEY DON'T BELONG IN OUR TODAY'S
WORLD ANYMORE.
CAROLYN: YOU ARE HOPING THE EU
CAN FIND WAYS OF MAKING BUSINESS
EASIER HERE IN THE EU?
>> AND ALSO ELSEWHERE.
WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE
CUSTOMER PERSPECTIVE.
AND FOR A CUSTOMER, CHOICE
MATTERS.
CAN MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER.
YOU HAVE CHEAP MOBILITY OPTIONS.
SOME FOR THE SHORT DISTANCE AND
SOME FOR THE LONGER DISTANCE.
AS SOON AS YOU OFFER CHOICE,
ACTUALLY THE MOBILITY SERVICES
AND THE TAXI INDUSTRY, IT STARTS
TO GROW BECAUSE CUSTOMERS AT THE
END OF THE DAY COME TO A POINT
WHERE THEY DON'T NEED AN OLD CAR
ANYMORE.
THEY ARE STANDING AROUND AT THE
END TIME OF ITS LIFE.
THE BUDGET IS THEN FREE.
ALSO INTO TAXIS OR RIGHT HAILING
OR CAR SHARING OR THE BLACK LANE
SERVICE.
CAROLYN: YOU SEEM TO BE FITTING
INTO THE ECOSYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN
COEXIST WITH UBER AND SOME OTHER
TAXI COMPANIES AND CAR SHARING.
WHAT ABOUT CHINA IN TERMS OF
THIS IS AN INTERESTING STORY
THAT UBER DECIDED TO HAND OVER
THE REINS, MERGE RATHER THAN
COMPETE.
IS THAT A REGION YOU ARE HAVING
TO GO INTO?
>> IT IS THE SAME STORY.
THE ARE NOT A LOCAL MOBILITY
SERVICE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT WHAT
COUNTRY WE ARE TALKING.
WE SERVE INTERNATIONAL TRAVELER
NEEDS.
WHEN YOU THINK OF TRAVEL YOU CAN
DIFFERENTIATE A COMPANY BY
INCOMING TRAVELERS, MAINLY
INTERNATIONAL WESTERN TRAVELERS
COMING IN THE CHINA.
OUTBOUND CHINA, CHINESE TOURISTS
GOING INTO THE WESTERN WORLD.
AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU ARE
TALKING ABOUT DOMESTIC TRAVEL.
THAT IS LARGELY VERY LOCAL,
SHORT DISTANCE.
THAT IS NOT OUR PIECE.
WE BRING PEOPLE INTO CHINA AND
OUT OF CHINA.
THEREFORE WE CAN GREATLY COEXIST
WITH ALL THE MOBILITY SERVICES
AROUND.
CAROLYN: AND YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO DO THAT EFFICIENTLY?
>> WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING IN
THE BACKGROUND SECRETLY.
DON'T TELL ANYONE.
WE'RE LAUNCHING INTO CITIES IN
THE APEX MARKET.
WE HAVE ALREADY LAUNCHED TWO
DOZEN OF THOSE IN THE LAST
WEEKS.
AND WE CONTINUE TO DO SO BECAUSE
YOU WANT TO SERVE GLOBAL CLIENT
BASE.
