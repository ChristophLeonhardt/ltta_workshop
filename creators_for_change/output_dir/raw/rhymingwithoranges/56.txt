for the war crime of hurting mr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Suggs</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">occupying it quite well of an evening</font>

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,940
jack had clearly been musing and as the

19
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet this why do coming out videos</font>

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,800
have to be so deep sad and grayscale

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,050
none of us are bothered be who<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,410
be hard and it's a brave thing to do but

25
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,120
monetizing the video and using a fully

26
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,539
capitalize title takes the shine off so

27
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:58,859
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do my best to not one of these</font>

28
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,270
tweets completely out of the park and

29
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,430
kick the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> one a little further down</font>

30
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,339
the road does that sound good then shall

31
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,320
we why do coming up videos have to be so

32
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,409
deep sad and grayscale none of us are

33
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,180
bothered right I would love it if I

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">could announce my sexuality with</font>

35
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,450
streamers and a vuvuzela every single

36
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,520
time I came out and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

37
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">people seem to forget they're coming out</font>

38
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't just a one-time thing and then get</font>

39
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,640
done like I don't know smallpox I have

40
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,409
to announce my sexuality in some way

41
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:26,850
shape<font color="#CCCCCC"> or form</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every time I enter a new</font>

43
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,630
the first time and every time I have

44
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,920
that conversation there's the risk that

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,140
I've stumbled across a homophobe who at

46
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,850
worst wants to lynch me and at best

47
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,229
wants to try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> convince</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me that I can</font>

48
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,060
be saved to which the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> appropriate</font>

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,400
responses Jesus was a bearded man in his

50
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,530
30s who wore dresses and has apps for

51
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,740
days<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally one of us so for gay people</font>

52
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,659
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> for anybody who is queer it's very</font>

53
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,130
very possible to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

54
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,350
conversation lightheartedly there's

55
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,540
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chance that that person is not</font>

56
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,729
an ally which probably explains the<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey</font>

57
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,880
the sad and the deep Jack it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

58
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,140
that you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that being gay is not a</font>

59
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,540
big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I feel different in society</font>

60
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,000
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day because of my sexuality</font>

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,590
and God knows it's getting better

62
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,720
oranges and Novak is most glorious thing

63
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:09,880
to

64
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,510
grace our screens but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still get abuse</font>

65
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,850
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time I hope my boyfriend's</font>

hand in public where we've been verbally

67
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,620
abused kicked and had stuff thrown at us

68
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,430
being gay is still in a wider context a

69
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,650
big deal what's more LGBT people are

70
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,970
seven times more likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to partake in</font>

71
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,830
substance abuse four times more<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely</font>

72
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,650
to attempt suicide and LGBT kids make up

73
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,020
twenty-five percent of the UK's homeless

74
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,760
youth that's not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> touching on the</font>

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,230
countries around the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a law</font>

76
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,050
isn't on our side there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten nations</font>

77
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,600
where I can still get killed for

78
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,700
enjoying buggery probably a little more

79
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">than I probably should now when Jack</font>

80
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,230
mentioned that monetizing a coming out

81
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,540
video took the shine off I<font color="#E5E5E5"> lowered my</font>

82
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,610
keyboard warrior blade and thought hmm

83
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,740
I've been really really vocal in the

84
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,270
past about people who are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> queer</font>

85
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,520
using coming out videos and queer

86
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,280
baiting to get views they shouldn't do

87
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,390
it no no no no no there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course the</font>

88
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,980
argument that queer people should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

89
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to monetize something that we</font>

90
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,570
previously<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have possibly been shot</font>

91
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,340
in jail for that's something quite

92
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,950
empowering about that and like it it's

93
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,420
also doubtless the coming out videos

94
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,220
have helped young queer kids by showing

95
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,070
their LGBT folks come in all shapes and

96
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,500
sizes and that it does get<font color="#CCCCCC"> better we've</font>

97
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,090
taken our representation into our own

98
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,430
hands which is awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> however when you</font>

99
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,870
hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about creators not choosing to come</font>

100
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,460
out until they hit a certain level of

101
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,890
subscribers for maximum impact when you

102
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,290
see people cock-teasing confirmation of

103
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,709
their sexuality over several videos it

104
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,950
just leaves a bad taste in one's mouth

105
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,840
to summarize do I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with</font>

106
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,300
lgbtq+ people making money<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of coming</font>

107
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,450
out videos no do I approve<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jack that if</font>

108
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,040
you choose to approach it in a

109
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,420
money-making way it takes the shine off

110
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,790
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably as always I want you guys</font>

111
