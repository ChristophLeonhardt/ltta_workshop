your thoughts on that what are your
thoughts on that okay so Chad I have to
ask you is it hard being loved so much
by so many people well it's got its
challenges you know and being in the
public eye always comes with so much
scrutiny you know I mean there's all the
fan meetups social media like Twitter is
blowing up always like literally every
second of every day but it's not just
that there's like the industry comes
with its problems too I mean like the
food they give us right
Kazi also there are some fans outside I
thought we'd go meet him really after
that I'm tired it's a bit selfish to do
the pressed rocket is easy-peasy we owe
it to Li T is gonna be here so I'm just
waiting here with a bunch of other fans
and we're gonna ambush them when they
come out I can't wait to meet them and
Chad's my favorite for sure I just want
to look like him get plastic surgery
make my skin Wyatt everything you know
what I like about this job I get to see
all these cute chicks cool people they
all want to be around me because I know
the you know the celebrities the pet
hates the fans they always jump on the
car right why always jump on the car
I just feel like you're complaining
about nothing a lot of the time things
are just different from Yuri ah crap
what did you expect I've got a crazy
idea how about we just make sure our
police on abusing anyone regardless of
color so bad about that
could be interpreted as you being anti
police but I'm not but it could be
interpreted could go either way really
oh really Chad you use it the same thing
I'm Twitter few months back and
everybody loved it this is different
Alex why because you're not Chad
we'll get this fixed soon you'll do an
apology statement okay apology for
trying to spread awareness what if I was
I don't know
Taylor Swift or Miley Cyrus it's not the
same and you know it it's just how the
world works I don't make the rules but
you've got to play by them
he says it's pretty much exactly what
you tweet it pretty much exactly the
same thing yeah that's what I said
that's messed up yeah I don't listen
well
would you know what different different
and you say we're treated the same I
thought we were we're not if we
definitely not people treat me
differently all the time
sometimes the inappropriate sometimes
it's just patronizing lawyers look I
don't go to play along to survive and
the B's but just once I'd like to stick
it to him you know well I mean I can't
make any decisions for you but I'll
support whatever you choose I'm speaking
today to address the heinous things I
said on social media pretty good yeah
okay remember everyone thinks that
you're the worst right now yeah yeah so
let's feel bad okay yeah yeah you're
you're problematic mm-hmm
and actually the idea that I would
attempt to spread awareness about an
important issue is disgusting and I no
no no no no no no no no what
it's not happening come on
God don't be so sensitive it's just
business
I don't want your business I don't want
their business you need to listen to me
