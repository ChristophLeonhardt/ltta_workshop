a group of unarmed militants have left the besieged enclave of Eastern goose' in Syria through humanitarian corridors this comes after talks brokered by Moscow this video shows the militants leaving the area through the exit route they're being escorted out of the area by Syrian soldiers Arty's Daniel Hawkins has more sudden development in guter today given the deadlock over the past weeks and months in the region two pieces of news coming out so the first a group of 13 unarmed militants and their families leaving the area through one of those Russian military Syrian government organized checkpoints those safety corridors are offered to civilians and fighters to leave the area should they wish to do so now this is significant because prior to this all offers by the Russian military and the Syrian government were rejected by rebel groups in the region despite unverified video shown of Flyers being dropped over the towns and the city in the area no groups have taken up that offer so far and civilians allegedly have also been prevented from leaving the area through those corridors because of shelling to those roads now the other bit of news is that the Syrian rebel group Jaysh al-islam has issued a statement in which they've said they have taken the decision to release members of the terrorist group Al nusra formerly al Qaeda in Syria from prisons in guter and transported them through destination likely to be in Lib in the north of the country one of the last major rebel strongholds in Syria this echoes similar previous moves during the Syrian civil war where rebels have been evacuated from places such as in Lib such as Homs other towns as well under these ceasefire agreements and moved up to Italy province thus allowing the Syrian government to move in take over the area and avoid long protracted conflict causing more bloodshed we don't yet know if the statement from Jaysh al-islam and these rebels leaving the area are linked we don't know what group they're from either way though this does mark a significant development and could leave the door open to a wider evacuation of rebel fighters and civil from the area in the coming future well earlier on Friday a UN humanitarian convoy finally managed to enter Eastern goose' the aid supplies had been delayed by heavy fighting as government forces battle terrorists there according to the latest UN estimates the fighting in eastern guter has resulted in more than a hundred deaths in two days the United Nations also called on all parties in the conflict to end the violence Red Cross spokesperson Ralph el-hadji says the people on the ground require a wide range of basic supplies the need of people remain massive the needs are are twofold threefold etc you have medical needs you have need for access to a good source of food you need also access to to clean water you have all sorts of needs inside water today the priority remains medical help that we need to reach with people inside water and food aid as well what happened 500 people which the trucks on Monday and today were able to provide humanitarian aid who are just a little percentage of who of the people who need humanitarian aid and side therefore we're always ready once an agreement is reached between the parties to give us the security guarantees to go back inside and deliver more and more humanitarian aid this could happen next week if all parties agree again to allow us to enter despite the danger that we were facing we were able to finish quickly and rapidly and able to go back however the danger was still present and and that shouldn't be a recurrence if we are able to reach an agreement between all the parties next week to return back to eastern hota with more and more aid that we know as much needed inside meanwhile around 10 kilometres away there are reports of more terror attacks on civilians fresh shelling from eastern Guterres hitting residential areas of the capital Damascus Russia's Defense Ministry says two people were injured in the attack sameer assaults have been occurring on an almost daily basis since government forces increased pressure on the terrorists in eastern guter although some of the previous attacks have been far more deadly we were in the shop were working we heard a sound we didn't know whether if the explosion was close or far away we went outside and found people at the scene with injuries that would make anyone literally shudder for more on this we can now cross live to investigative journalist Rick Stirling Rick thank you very much for joining us well as we heard there a group of rebel fighters left the guter area on Friday through the humanitarian corridor but how much of a breakthrough is this in the overall peace effort I think it's a positive indication and it's really a result of the advances that the Syrian government has has made they've they've reportedly taken about 50% of the whole Eastern goota area that was occupied by the the armed militants for the past four to five years so what we're seeing is a positive this positive indication of of the first group of terrorists or armed militants leaving and another indication of that is that there's now video credible video coming out showing civilians in the occupied areas openly publicly protesting against the occupation by the armed militants and so that there are they're inviting they're welcoming the advance of the Syrian army so I think these are positive Indyk indications of what's going on well let's look at some of the reaction I mean the US State Department dismissed Russia's plan for humanitarian corridors as a joke I mean why do you think Washington's unwilling to support this effort well they don't they don't want to see the effort succeed is what it boils down to sadly they don't want to see that the the occupied areas the terrorist groups expelled from the zone we saw there that in East Aleppo and as soon as the East Aleppo was actually liberated and the terrorists were all shipped out or were expelled the Western media all fled as fast as they could so they don't unfortunately the West is is continuing to support the terrorist groups that Ben you know raining havoc in Syria since 2011 let's also look at the consequences here I mean the Russian government is trying to persuade the remaining militants to leave guter and head to Italy province but is there a danger that they'll simply rearm and cause trouble elsewhere well they they have their base of operations in Italy banned and clearly the the strategy of the Syrian government and their allies is to remove the terrorists from the more populated areas and get them all concentrated enid lib and and deal with that down the road it's tremendously positive to remove the terrorists from around Damascus Damascus has grown by 35% in the course of this conflict to be a huge City now because many civilians have had who had to flee whether it's from East guta or Hama or homes or some of the other cities they ended up in Damascus so it's a highly it's a densely populated city that's had mortars and Hill cannon missiles coming into it on a nearly basis which I witnessed myself in which your your previous video portrayed finally I mean looking at the the siege of Rio so that's been going on since April 2013 I mean do you expect the Syrian government's who regain control over the area over the coming months it may take less time than that actually the fact that in in two or three weeks they've recaptured 50 percent is a positive sign now that's the more that's more of the farming area and the smaller villages so the remaining 50 percent that still controlled by the terrorist groups is the more urbanized area and that'll be a tough that'll be tougher going I expect but the news today about some terrorists leaving the area the news of public protests by civilians in those areas against the against the occupying militants are positive indications believe it Ric sterling investigative journalist thank you very much
