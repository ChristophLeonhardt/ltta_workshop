1
00:00:00,363 --> 00:00:03,666
INCLUDING ONE THAT LEFT 130 DEAD

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:04,200
IN 2015.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:04,767
GRIFF, OVER TO YOU.

4
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:06,869
>> THANK WU,

5
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:06,902
>> THANK YU,

6
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:08,471
>> THANK YOU, PETE.

7
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:10,039
COMMENTS FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP

8
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:13,242
ABOUT NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR KIM

9
00:00:13,242 --> 00:00:15,044
JONG-UN SENDING THE MEDIA INTO A

10
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:15,544
TOTAL TAIL SPIN.

11
00:00:15,544 --> 00:00:17,913
>> HE'S THE HEAD OF A COUNTRY.

12
00:00:17,913 --> 00:00:20,216
I MEAN HE'S THE STRONG HEAD.

13
00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:21,617
DON'T LET ANYONE THINK ANYTHING

14
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:21,984
DIFFERENT.

15
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:24,553
HE SPEAKS AND HIS PEOPLE SIT UP

16
00:00:24,553 --> 00:00:24,987
AT ATTENTION.

17
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:26,689
I WANT MY PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME.

18
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:28,090
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID IT WITH US

19
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,892
A JOKE BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP THE

20
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:31,027
HEADLINES BIKE THE WASHINGTON

21
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:32,695
POST CALLING IT DICTATOR ENVY

22
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:35,798
AND POLITICO SAYING DONALD

23
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:37,033
DREAMS OF DICK CATERS.

24
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:40,336
IS THE MEDIA MAKING THIS FOR

25
00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:41,203
SOMETHING NEGATIVE?

26
00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:45,975
HERE TO DEBATE, ANTWUAN

27
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:46,342
SEAWRIGHT.

28
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:48,244
GOOD MORNING, ANTWUAN, LET ME

29
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:49,578
START WITH YOU.

30
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:51,147
IS THE MEDIA BLOWING THIS

31
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:53,616
COMMENT WHICH WAS INTEBDED

32
00:00:53,616 --> 00:00:54,383
COMMENT WHICH WAS INTENDED FOR A

33
00:00:54,383 --> 00:00:55,584
JOKE ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT,

34
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:57,420
ARE THEY BLOWING IT OUT OF

35
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,820
PROPORTION?

36
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,923
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE TK

37
00:01:00,923 --> 00:01:01,323
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE TE

38
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:02,691
SERIOUS AND WHAT NOT TO TAKE

39
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:04,427
SERIOUS WITH THIS PRESIDENT.

40
00:01:04,427 --> 00:01:07,596
WE TEND TO RESPOND TO WHAT HE

41
00:01:07,596 --> 00:01:08,130
GIVES US.

42
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,632
AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS

43
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,901
THIS PRESIDENT HAS THE HISTORY

44
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:13,269
OF FLIRTING WITH THE IDEA OF

45
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:15,771
PROCESS OF SOME DICTATORSHIP

46
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,039
BEHAVIOR, FOR INSTANCE, WANTING

47
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:19,175
TO JAIL HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS

48
00:01:19,175 --> 00:01:20,242
SPEAKING TO HILLARY CLINTON.

49
00:01:20,242 --> 00:01:21,644
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TAKE

50
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:23,879
SERIOUS AND WHAT TO TAKE NOT.

51
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,414
WHAT I'VE BEEN TAUGHT IS THERE'S

52
00:01:25,414 --> 00:01:28,417
ALWAYS AN ELEMENT OF SERIOUSNESS

53
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:28,918
TO EVERY JOKE.

54
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:30,419
>> MORGAN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

55
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:31,020
RESPOND TO THAT?

56
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,654
>> YEAH.

57
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:33,055
SO I THINK IT WAS CLEARLY A

58
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:33,823
JOKE.

59
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:36,158
AND I ACTUALLY THINK THERE'S A

60
00:01:36,158 --> 00:01:37,626
STRATEGY BEHIND THE FLATTERING

61
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:40,863
WORDS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD

62
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:41,964
FOR KIM JONG-UN RECENTLY.

63
00:01:41,964 --> 00:01:43,432
MOST OF THIS PRESIDENCY,

64
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:44,767
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN TOUGH

65
00:01:44,767 --> 00:01:45,468
ON KIM JONG-UN.

66
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:48,571
IN FACT THE SAME MEDIA NOW

67
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:49,538
CRITICIZING HIM FOR WHAT I THINK

68
00:01:49,538 --> 00:01:52,274
IS A JOKE, SAID HE WAS ON THE

69
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:54,276
BRINK OF LEADING AMERICA TO THE

70
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:54,910
BRINK OF WAR.

71
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,012
WHAT YOU SAW FOR A FULL YEAR OF

72
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:59,815
HIS PRESIDENCY WAS VERY TOUGH

73
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:00,916
RHETT TICK ON NORTH KOREA.

74
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,586
NOW THAT HE'S MET WITH HIM, HE'S

75
00:02:03,586 --> 00:02:05,121
TRYING TO GET TO A DEAL.

76
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:08,257
HE'S PLAYING GOOD COP IN THIS

77
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:09,592
ADMINISTRATION AND LETTING

78
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:13,963
SECRETARY POMPEO AND AMBASSADOR

79
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:15,731
BOLTON, THEY'VE HAD TOUGH WORDS

80
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:16,799
FOR NORTH KOREA.

81
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:19,068
UNTIL THEY SEE A GOOD ACT ON

82
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:21,437
NORTH KOREA TO DENUCLEARIZE.

83
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:22,705
MY ASSESSMENT IS WHAT YOU'RE

84
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:23,973
SEEING IN THE ADMINISTRATION,

85
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:25,608
THE PRESIDENT IS PLAYING GOOD

86
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:27,009
COP TRYING TO GET A DEAL DONE

87
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:29,512
AND LETTING HIS DEPUTIES TAKE ON

88
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:30,079
THE TOUGHER ROLE.

89
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,248
>> MORGAN, THAT IS VERY UNSTABLE

90
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:35,084
AND IT IS A DIFFERENT STYLE OF

91
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:36,185
BEHAVIOR WHEN IT COMES TO

92
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:37,353
FOREIGN POLICY.

93
00:02:37,353 --> 00:02:40,489
AND EVEN THE U.N. AMBASSADOR

94
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:41,757
NIKKI HALEY SPOKE TO THE

95
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:45,161
UNSTABLE PS AND UNPREDICTABILITY

96
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:47,963
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS MAN IN

97
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:48,397
NORTH KOREA.

98
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:51,066
I THINK THAT SETS A DANGEROUS

99
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:54,170
PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE LEADERS.

100
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,239
THIS IS BIGGER THAN MR. TRUMP

101
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,741
AND FUTURE LEADERS.

102
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:00,943
>> IS THIS NOT THE PRESIDENT

103
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:02,511
PATH OF DIPLOMACY.

104
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:04,747
THIS IS HIS WHOLE PLAN.

105
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:07,149
WE SAW PRESIDENT OBAMA,

106
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:08,884
CONTROVERSIAL LEADERS, CASTRO

107
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,052
COMES TO MIND.

108
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:12,221
IS THIS NOT, MORGAN, I WANT YOU

109
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,222
TO RESPOND TO THIS.

110
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:18,160
IS THIS NOT PART OF A LOORNLGERL

111
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,194
IS THIS NOT PART OF A LOORNLGERR

112
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:18,227
IS THIS NOT PART OF A LOORNLGERE

113
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:18,694
IS THIS NOT PART OF A LOORNLGERR

114
00:03:18,694 --> 00:03:18,994
PLAN?

115
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:20,429
>> I THINK THE PEOPLE HAVE USED

116
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:21,697
THE EXAMPLE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA

117
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:23,032
MEETING WITH THE LEADERS WHICH

118
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:25,301
IS A LEGITIMATE COMPARISON.

119
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,635
HOWEVER THE DIFFERENCE IS IN

120
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:29,438
THOSE NEGOTIATIONS, THOSE

121
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:31,140
COUNTRIES LIKE CUBA, THEY WERE

122
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,175
CRITICIZED AT THE TIME BECAUSE

123
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:34,710
SANCTIONS WERE RELIEVED AND

124
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,378
PENALTIES WERE TAKEN OFF OF THE

125
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:38,380
TABLE BEFORE YOU SAW THE OTHER

126
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,783
SIDE COME TO ANY SORT OF A DEAL.

127
00:03:40,783 --> 00:03:42,284
THE DIFFERENCE IS IN NORTH

128
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:44,787
KOREA, SANCTIONS ARE STILL IN

129
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:45,821
PLACE, THE THREAT OF FORCE IS

130
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:48,557
THERE WU THE

131
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:48,591
THERE BU THE

132
00:03:48,591 --> 00:03:48,724
THERE BUTTHE

133
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:48,757
THERE BUT TE

134
00:03:48,757 --> 00:03:50,092
THERE BUT THE PRESIDENT IS

135
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:52,027
BACKING OFF SAYING I'M WILLING

136
00:03:52,027 --> 00:03:52,928
TO MAKE A DEAL.

137
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:55,130
>> THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS THE

138
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,699
HYPOCRISY WE SEE FROM THE RIGHT

139
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,634
OF THE IDEA OF SPEAKING TO OR

140
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:03,038
TALKING TO DICTATORS.

141
00:04:03,038 --> 00:04:05,074
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE

142
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:06,909
RIGHT EXPLODING WHEN PRESIDENT

143
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:07,209
OBAMA.

144
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:07,977
>> QUICKLY.

145
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:09,211
>> HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE.

146
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:11,947
NORTH KOREA HAS THE CAPABILITY.

147
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,416
THEY HAVE SOME OF THE MOST

148
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,252
SOPHISTICATED CYBER WARFARE IN

149
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:16,685
THE WORLD.

150
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:18,187
THIS IS A DIFFERENT CASE THAN

151
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:19,922
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE WORLD.

152
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:22,157
THE CHICKENS FINALLY CAME HOME

153
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:24,326
TO ROOST IN NORTH KOREA.

154
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:26,161
>> IT'S FATHER'S DAY.

155
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:27,830
WE GOT TO MOVE ON.

156
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,230
THANK YOU.

157
00:04:28,230 --> 00:00:00,000
WE DID HAVE AN EARLY MORNING
