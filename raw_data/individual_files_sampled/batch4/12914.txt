on Saturday night an Isis bomber blew himself up along with 51 other people and a Kurdish wedding party in Kezia tum' in Turkey according to the Turkish government the suicide bomber was 12 to 14 years old then on Sunday night in Kirkuk Iraqi police tackled the would-be suicide bomber a 12 year old boy they stripped him of his suicide belts according to the UN thousands of children have been kidnapped in Iraq with many boys recruited or pressured into suicide bombing just a few weeks ago tape emerged from a Palestinian man sending his toddler son at soldiers the toddler carried a Palestinian flag the kid three years old also carried rocks the father urged the boy to throw them at the soldiers instead the Israeli troops gave over and gave the boy a high-five jihadis routinely recruited children for military purposes during the iran-iraq war the Iranian regime recruited and used thousands of children in battle as human shields and reportedly to clear minefields Saddam Hussein also used to use kids in his army terrorist groups from Hamas to Hezbollah routinely trained small children in terrorist methods Westerners simply can't understand the barbaric willingness of jihadist enemies to sacrifice their own kids to murder other people but that's the nature of this battle and that's why it's so unbelievably foolhardy of the left to assume that women and teens can't be radicalized to assume jihadis are mainly concerned about economic immobility to differentiate between the battles fought by Israel against jihadism and the battles fought by all the other Western countries against those same jihadists jihadists are willing to sacrifice their kids not because they're looking for new sanitation jobs but because they have a philosophy of life and death that differs from that of the West Hamas routinely proclaims we love death more than you love life and so they're willing to kill their own kids to fight the infidel meanwhile the West struggles with how to deal with the fact that we love jihadist kids more than their own parents do that's an intractable philosophic problem it's not gonna be solved with pretty Obama turns a phrase or redistribution of income it's only gonna be solved by a complete and utter defeat of jihadist ideology and the killing of his many jihadists is humanly possible the first step though is recognizing their evil they are not like us not when they treat their kids like animals i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show so first of all thanks to our sponsor today ring.com there's a home burglary that happens every 13

terrible awful mode that very bad person so Hillary Clinton has a lot of boo-boos over the weekend a lot of bad things happen so we begin with Huma Abedin so Huma Abedin who's her gal pal you know her gal pal so she her gal pal Huma Abedin who's her top aide she she apparently has now been linked has been true for years people have linked her to this before to the journal of Muslim minority affairs as her mommy was the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Muslim minority affairs and Huma Abedin started working there about the time she became a White House intern and while she was there she specifically greenlit a piece she was she that ripped apart Hillary Clinton's feminist agenda there's a 1996 article arguing that single moms working moms and gay couples with kids should not be recognized as families it also states that more revealing dress assured him by women's lib quote directly translates into unwanted results of sexual promiscuity and irresponsibility and indirectly promote violence against women so that's the whole short skirt means that you want to be raped argument that was one of the articles that she published while she was the assistant editor there the author a certain quote a conjugal family established through a marriage contract between a man and a woman and extended through procreation is the only definition of family that a Muslim can accept and they say that pushing mothers out into the open labor market is a clear demonstration of a lack of respect of womanhood motherhood so that's not even just saying that if you address on non modestly that that's the best that's now saying that if a woman works that's a terrible thing she was the editor at this at this journal at the same time all this was going on now imagine for a second he had a Republican who is the editor of a journal where they said women working was terrible and non-religious and horrible in every way imagine that for one second you think that person would last five seconds in national politics but Huma Abedin won't be forced to disassociate from Hillary Clinton after all no one would want that heartbroken relationship on their hands so the media Inc and a force a divide between Huma Abedin and Hillary Clinton Abbadon right now she is saying that she played no formal role in the Muslim journal even though she was listed as an editor on the periodicals masthead for a dozen years not for five minutes for a dozen years they refused to say by the way whether she was being paid by the journal at the same time so it's pretty amazing that she was that's that story number one Hillary's top aide was the assistant editor on in journal that said that women should not work and that if women did work it was a dishonor so that's that's just lovely okay piece of a piece of news at number two from the Hillary being terrible category Hillary this just shows you how incestuous politics is poem Anna form was the campaign manager for Donald Trump until five minutes ago when he was ousted by Steve McFadden and poem Anna for is now under FBI investigation because Paul Manafort actually has deep and abiding links with the Russians and the Ukrainians he apparently took like 13 million dollars he didn't report federal government he's under investigation but he's not the only one under investigation also under investigation is a is a consulting group with whom he was linked that would of course be the Podesta group the Podesta group is run by John Podesta was founded by John Podesta John Podesta is of course Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman so this is so the Podesta group is now being investigated for connections they have through Trump's campaign manager so Hillary's campaign managers group is now being investigated for it's tied to Trump's campaign manager if that doesn't say incest I don't know what does but it's bad news for Hillary Clinton just showing more corrupt ties from Hillary Clinton that's piece of news number two piece of news number three Colin Powell came out and slammed Hillary Clinton so Hillary Clinton has now said she's now blaming : Powell for her email server because when in doubt Hillary Clinton blames the black guy so Hillary Clinton says that the reason she had a private server is because she was having dinner with Colin Powell and : Powell said you know what you should do you should set up a private email and she apparently said oh that sounds like a great idea okay the reality of course that what : Powell did while he was Secretary of State has nothing to do with what Hillary did : Powell had a personal email address where he handled personal emails and he had a government email address where he handed government emails which is kind of how you were supposed to do it at the time later they said put it all in the government email so we can make sure that everything is safe so that people don't email you the wrong thing the wrong email address but Colin Powell said you know I used to have one not the other I didn't I didn't have a private server right a private email address Hillary says no that's why I set up a private server so now Colin Powell says look I'm not gonna get thrown under the bus on this thing I am NOT interested in being her fall her fall guy so here is a spokesperson spokeswoman for Powell's office issued a statement quote general Powell has no recollection of the dinner conversation he did write Secretary Clinton an email memo describing his use of personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department at the time there was no equivalent system within the department he used a secure state computer on his desk to manage classified information the general no longer has the email he sent to former Secretary Clinton it may exist in state or FBI files although since she was using a private email address rather doubtful he was also asked by People magazine about whether he was the source of all of this and he said no hello no Clinton's just trying to use me as a fall guy so well done Hillary Clinton she's desperately trying to drive out the black vote and she pissed off one of one of the leaders in the black community Colin Powell so that was a bad piece of her weekends that story number three story number four her Hillary Clinton had to announce over the weekend that the Clinton Foundation is going to stop taking foreign and corporate donations now if that sounds familiar that's because Hillary Clinton has done that before in 2008 the Clinton Foundation said that they would no longer accept donations from all of the front from this here's here's what the Clinton Global Initiative said okay this is a memorandum of understanding that was signed by Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsay does a memo of understanding should Senator Clinton be confirm this 2008 should senator Clinton be confirmed as Secretary of State the foundation will incorporate CGI the Clinton Global Initiative as a separate entity from the foundation President Clinton will continue in his role as principal host and be identified as he gi's founding chairman but he will not serve as an officer or director of the newly established entity or otherwise service fiduciary on behalf of CGI CGI will also suspend plans for CGI international events outside the United States during any service by Senator Clinton at the State Department apart from attendance fees for CGI CGI will not accept contributions from foreign governments did that happen no that did not happen no that did not happen in November the foundation had to restate six years of tax documents to account for previously undisclosed revenue from foreign governments so that's bad news piece at number four for Hillary Clinton the Clinton Foundation is obviously a pass-through for the State Department basically there's a massive pay-for-play deal going on people would give money to the Clinton Foundation and then they'd get favors from Hillary Clinton so that's bad piece of news number four bad piece of news number five for Hillary Clinton I mean this thing really stacks out bad news piece number five for Hillary Clinton according to the Daily Caller apparently there was six billion with a B billion dollars in contract mismanagement fraud and incompetence that happened under her watch at the Department of State that's according to the cause of the action institute they say the total value of the content of the contracts reviewed by the inspector general exceeded six billion dollars many of those cases arose during the tenure of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton so she basically blew six billion dollars on waste and frauds that's piece of bad news number five piece of bad news number six so the over the just now I mean this broke today the FBI has now said that they have uncovered 15,000 undisclosed emails in the Hillary Clinton probe fifteen thousand so you remember she turned over thirty and she said that's all I have to turn over that's all there is that's all there is right all there is is fifteen to a is thirty thousand emails the rest I destroyed because they were all about yoga and look at my fine physique in my tight bootie and you can tell how much yoga I've been doing and the FBI laughed and laughed and laughed and they said yeah she's probably right because they're corrupt so the FBI has now uncovered almost 15,000 previously undisclosed documents sent directly to or from Hillary Clinton according to State Department's lawyer they confirm that before a federal judge on Monday the documents according to the hill were found during the course of the FBI's investigation into the Democratic presidential nominees use of a personal email server during her time as Secretary of State the number is 50% more than the 30 thousand she said that she turned over I love this part it remains unsettled whether the full set will be out before the presidential election on November 8th they say they're gonna reveal some of these in October unclear whether they're going to reveal all of them before out here's that here's the good news as far as that goes I mean it's not really good news but it's true if the FBI has these emails so does WikiLeaks so you can assure that all of these will be out before November so that's what six pieces of bad news all breaking over this weekend all demonstrating that Hillary Clinton is corrupt that her aides are radical or associated with radicals that she's deeply in bed with with all of these foreign governments including people like the aforementioned Nigerian Lebanese businessperson Shigure II who gave a bunch of money to the Clinton Global Initiative and then was ushered into kind of the inner sanctum of the State Department and now we're learning that he was also deeply associated with mark rich you may remember mark rich he's the guy that Clinton pardoned just before the 2000 election in order to sort of buy off a block of votes in New York for his wife in her senatorial race I mean the Clintons are so corrupt they're so insanely corrupt and now there's this whole new tranche of emails that is apparently going to break none of that is good news of course for Hillary Clinton all of that is very terrible news for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump you know Donald Trump he he actually hit hard on this so Donald Trump came out and he gave a statement he said the Clinton Foundation needs to disband here's Donald Trump saying that on Fox & Friends this morning number one shut it down number two they should give the money back to a lot of countries that we shouldn't be taking and they shouldn't be taking money from countries that influenced her totally and also countries that discriminate against women and gays and everybody else I mean that money should be going it should be given back they should not take that money honestly do you think that'll happen it should happen whether or not it will and very greedy people so maybe it won't but it should happen and that of course is exactly right Donald Trump is right on the money the Clinton Foundation should be shut down it is a scam it is a it is a a corrupt organization that was used as a pass through by Hillary Clinton and her cronies Trump also went after Huma Abedin he said look to pretend that Hillary didn't know all this stuff about Huma Abedin when they've been working together for literally about two decades is just insane here's Donald Trump going after Huma Abedin and today the Trump the Clinton camp answer and said her name was just on there she didn't really do anything she had no formal role as the exact quote of the radical Muslim journal editor yeah you know it's interesting because of course that's terrible that it should happen and it's a lie it's another lie that they tell but what about the fact that Huma Abedin who knows every single thing about Hillary Clinton she does more about Hillary than Hillary knows and she's married to a pervert sleaze named Anthony Weiner who will send anything that he has out over Twitter or any other form of getting it out I mean she's married to Anthony Weiner she knows everything that Hillary Clinton is doing and she's married to a guy that has no control over so okay and that's of course 100% true again because the whole relationship between human a bird and weiner and the Clintons it's really weird and it's and it's kind of odd like how is it that I mean this is like a real religious question Huma Abedin is a religious Muslim I mean she talks about it she married a Jewish guy that's kind of weird it's it's very rare that that happens it's actually more usual that if you're gonna have an intermarriage between Muslim and Jew that the man is Muslim and the woman's a Jew but to have a Muslim woman marrying a Jewish man is is at the very least statistically unusual the whole the whole situation just reeks no the whole thing is just odd and and there would be questions asked about this if Huma Abedin were not close to Hillary Clinton right a pillow if Huma Abedin were a Republican these sorts of questions would be asked on a routine basis she's Democrat she's close to Hillary Clinton and therefore everybody sort of ignores him well that's all the time we have here on Facebook live and YouTube
