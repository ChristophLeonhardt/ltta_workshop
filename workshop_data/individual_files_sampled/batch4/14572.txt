I have news for those city councilors who deem themselves to be social justice warriors intent on re-engineering society I know it's an eagle blow but your prime directive is to ensure that all the nitty-gritty in the big bad city works you know picking up the trash fixing the potholes on the flip side you do not have a mandate to censor movies for displaying content that you find personally offensive well Toronto lefty city councillor Drolma havoc he well he's at it again you see Joe mine's very much of you smoke he also mines very much of a character in a movie smokes and so it is that he wants any cinematic content depicting smoking to be rated 18 a meaning those under 18 must be accompanied by an adult because I guess a 17 year old seeing someone smoking might require grief counselling or something in any event in Ontario the 18 a rating is typically slapped on films that depict explicit violence frequent course language sexual activity and horror apparently smoking is explicitly horrific for councilor Mavic whose mantra seems to be think of the children thus in his role as Public Health Board Chair Maha the quants films reclassified should a character take a drag on a Marlboro in the Toronto Star article mackovic states the following quote we did smoking restrictions with restaurants hospitals workplaces and now this is the new frontier this is not about the nanny state this is about a state that cares about the well-being of its residents end quote well two things Joe a state that overly cares about the well-being of its residents that is the very definition of a nanny state and I find it downright spectacular that this councillor can't seem to tell the difference between banning real cigarettes being smoked by real people in real places as a opposed to the depiction of a cigarette on film something that even in 3d and Sensurround won't affect any of the viewing public and another thing what about all that g-rated stuff from yes a year well this content need to be reclassified if may have it gets his way I mean we're even talking Disney stuff here oh forget about skinning dalmatian puppies for a new fur coat karela deville really crossed the line with that cigarette and then there's a certain snow person Frosty the Snowman was a joke or cob pipe you say oh not on my ethics watch frosty he who violated creature hey not even looney tunes would be spared Joe's wrath all right nothing I am quite ready see down daddy that's better yeah and you thought the fumes coming out of Pepe's tailpipe that was the stuff to fear did you look I've never had a cigarette in my life and I think anyone contemplating tobacco smoking in 2018 given all that we know about the ill effects of smoking well perhaps you really need to see a psychiatrist and well I think my Havoc's heart is in the right place does anyone really want to see a scenario play out in which local yokel city councilors are deciding what kind of cinematic content is appropriate for the great unwashed masses I mean today it's cigarettes tomorrow it's oh I don't know car chases especially in a city like Toronto that is downgrading speed limits to 30 kilometers an hour and installing speed bumps to ensure cars don't go any faster than bicycles sorry Joe as health board chair stick to making sure the water is drinkable and that restaurants operate in a sanitary fashion as for reclassifying films for our protection we had just please self-censor yourself for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's own Menzies hey folks the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
