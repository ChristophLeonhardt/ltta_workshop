for many this is the difference between home and homelessness having this place it gave me a broad vision on life the room is about the size of the prison cell ernest roberts once occupied but for less than $500 this diminutive domicile is home they make him productive citizens out of people if there was a closed this place it had put a lot of people's back up on the streets back doing crime back doing jewels back doing a lot of other negative things across the United States homes like this are disappearing in 1915 Chicago had 3,700 single room occupancy hotels like this one Spartan space at bargain prices with a bathroom down the hall there are now just 60 left although the number of sorrows has declined the need for it has actually increased because the number of homeless and the number of poor people needing SRO housing is grant rapidly increasing Chicago passed an ordinance to protect SROs three years ago requiring sellers to first consider buyers who would preserve them as SROs but with real-estate prices rising they're now selling faster than ever 36 since the law passed and it's not just happening here what Chicago has experienced has been experienced also in Philadelphia San Francisco Los Angeles New York and they all go through the same situations where you have politicians who want to cater to the well-to-do and they will sacrifice the poor to accommodate those who have more money some their windowless walls topped by wire cages for ventilation are known as cage hotels the Wilson men's hotel is closing for renovations and when it reopens there will be fewer rooms and they'll go from 320 dollars apiece to 800 dollars and up so many people here are gonna have to find a new place and for some that could mean the street as single room hotels have closed chicago's homeless problem has increased when I was younger coming up there would a set of drugs on gangs so I'm gonna try to clean myself up I got a job Solomon Johnson used his tiny room as a bridge from one life to another that's the good thing about everybody's welcome his single room hotels disappear that's a bridge that each year fewer Americans are able to cross john Hendren al jazeera Chicago
