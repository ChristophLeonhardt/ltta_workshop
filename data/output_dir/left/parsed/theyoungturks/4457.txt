ON THE SEASON OPENER OF GAME OF
THRONES, BRITISH SINGER ED
SHEERAN HAD A CAMEO.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE SINGER,
LITTLE BIT DARK, IT IS THE WOODS
AFTER ALL, AND A FUN TRIVIA
FACT, THE WORLD THAT GAME OF
THRONES IS SET ON DOES NOT
ACTUALLY HAVE A MOON.
IF WE GO TO THE NEXT ONE, WHAT
TO SEE A PICTURE, THEN
LAUGHING ALONG.
HE HAD TWO LINES AFTER SINGING A
LITTLE BIT.
IN FACT, BRETT IDENTIFIED HIM
BASED ON THE VOICE BEFORE HE
ACTUALLY SHOWED HIS FACE ON THE
SHOW, AND YOU MIGHT THINK,
THAT'S INTERESTING, LITTLE
CAMEO, THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE
WITH SINGERS ñ NOT AS
HIGH-PROFILE NECESSARILY, BUT
THEY HAD SINGERS ON BEFORE.
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE NOT
HAVING IT, AND THERE WAS THIS
UPROAR ONLINE, THAT A CELEBRITY
WOULD DARE TO HAVE A CAMEO
APPEARANCE, LIKE ED SHEERAN.
IT IS BELIEVED TO BE RELATED TO
THAT THAT ED SHEERAN TOOK
HIMSELF OFF TWITTER.
OF COURSE THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY
THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS
HAS HAPPENED.
A FEW MONTHS BACK HE SAID THIS:
"I'VE ACTUALLY COME OFF
TWITTER COMPLETELY.
I CAN'T READ IT.
I GO ON IT AND IS NOTHING BUT
PEOPLE SAYING MEAN THINGS.
ONE COMMENT RUINED YOUR DAY, BUT
THAT'S WHY HAVE COME OFF IT."
HIS COMMENT ABOUT PEOPLE SAYING
MEAN THINGS, WE'VE LOOKED
INTO IT AND IT WAS ACTUALLY
TRUE.
HE RECENTLY CAME BACK ON IT, HE
DOESN'T READ IT HE SAYS,
BUT HE DOES TWEET SIMILAR
HOWEVER, HIS ACCOUNT WENT
DOWN AFTER THE UPROAR OVER HIS
APPEARANCE.
I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO SAY.
NUMBER ONE, WHEN JOHN SAID THAT
BRETT CALLED IT WHEN WE
WERE WATCHING IT LIVE, I WAS
THINKING, DID WE ALL WATCH
IT LIVE?
ACTUALLY WE DO, AND YOU GUYS CAN
WATCH IT WITH US.
WE COVER IT ON WHAT THE FLICK?
YOU WATCH IT AT HOME, WE WATCH
IT HERE AND WE DO BASICALLY
PLAY-BY-PLAY, BUT WE TALKED VERY
LITTLE BECAUSE IT'S GAME OF
THRONES LET'S BE REAL.
BUT BRETT DID SAY WHILE WE WERE
WATCHING IT LIVE, IS THAT ED
SHEERAN?
NO, I SAID, THAT'S ED SHEERAN.
IT WASN'T A QUESTION, THERE'S NO
QUESTION WHEN YOU HEAR THE
DULCET TONES OF THAT GINGER.
WE WANTED IN THE STUDIO, AND
THEN WE DO A REVIEW OF IT
IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER, SO GO TO
YOUTUBE.COM/WHATTHEFLICKSHOW, TO
CATCH ALL OF THOSE REVIEWS AS WE
ARE DOING IT LIVE, AND
AFTERWARDS YOU CAN SEE THE
REVIEW.
AND ONTO THIS, WHY ARE PEOPLE
UPSET ABOUT THIS?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I LOVE GAME OF THRONES, WE HAVE
BEEN REVIEWING IT ALL THESE
YEARS, AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY.
PEOPLE LOVE ED SHEERAN, HE'S A
GREAT SINGER.
SO HE DOESN'T HAVE HATERS.
I MEAN, EVERYBODY HAS HATERS
ONLINE, AS YOU'VE MENTIONED,
BUT I THINK IT WAS THE WAY IN
WHICH HIS CAMEO PLAYED OUT.
IT WAS THE LIKE...
FREEZE ON ED SHEERAN, AND THEN
FOR ME I WAS PICTURING ALL THE
TIMES THEY JUST DID LIKE, ALL
RIGHT ED, SAY YOUR LINE 5
TIMES, DIFFERENT WAYS.
HE HAD TWO LINES.
HE MAY AS WELL AS HAD A MARQUEE
WITH NEON LIGHTS GOING, ED
SHEERAN, TONIGHT ONLY!
REALLY?
YES, TO ME IT TAKES YOU
COMPLETELY OUT OF IT.
NOW, IT WAS A MOMENT, A
SHORT MOMENT, PEOPLE ARE
INTERACTING, AND HIS VOICE, WHEN
I HEAR IT, TAKES ME BACK TO
BEING A KID, I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I WAS LIKE, 30 WHEN HE BECAME
POPULAR.
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF FAMOUS
PEOPLE WHO HAVE CAMEOS ON GAME
OF THRONES, BUT I HAVEN'T YET
SEEN IT IN A WAY THAT TAKES
YOU COMPLETELY OUT OF IT.
WHEN I SAW IAN MCSHANE, WHEN HE
DID HIS CAMEO IT WAS LIKE, YES!
WELL HE'S AN ACTOR.
HE'S AN ACTOR FROM AN HBO SHOW,
I'M SO INTO IT, AND THEY DO THAT
ALL THE TIME, BUT WITH ED
SHEERAN IT WAS LIKE, HE WAS
THERE TO SING WELL, AND ACT
OKAY.
I DON'T THINK YOU ARE QUALIFIED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE YOU
KNOW WHO ED SHEERAN IS.
I'M THE PERFECT TEST
CASE, BECAUSE ñ
I PREPPED FOR THIS, I STILL
BARELY KNOW WHO HE IS.
BUT GOING INTO THE EPISODE I HAD
NEVER HEARD OF THIS PERSON
BEFORE.
HE SEEMED LIKE A FINE SINGER.
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A
DIFFERENT GROUP BECAUSE OF
THE SINGING.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHO ED
SHEERAN IS?
I'M WORSE THAN HIM.
WHEN YOU SAID IT DURING THE
SHOW, I THOUGHT HE WAS A
COUNTRY SINGER.
HE VERY WELL COULD BE.
MY POINT IS, I DID NOT KNOW WHO
HE WAS, AND IF YOU HADN'T
SAID ANYTHING I WOULD NOT HAVE
THOUGHT THERE WAS ANYTHING
WEIRD.
HE WAS TO SOME GUY WHO SANG AND
HAD TWO LINES.
WE FOCUSED ON IT TOO MUCH, HE
LOOKED LIKE EVERY OTHER
PERSON SHOWS UP ON GAME OF
THRONES.
RACIST.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S GET INTO WHY YOU MIGHT
HAVE BEEN THERE, BEFORE WE
RETURNED TO THE COMMENTARY.
HIS ACCOUNT WAS TAKEN AWAY, AND
THEN REPORTS CAME THAT HE
WAS BACK, BUT THEY DELETED ALL
OF HIS TWEETS, AND HE HAD
LESS THAN 200,000
FOLLOWERS ALL WE DOWN FROM 19
MILLION, WHICH MEANS I SHOULD
KNOW WHO HE WAS.
THAT DUDE HAD 19 MILLION
FOLLOWERS?
APPARENTLY.
HE'S DOWN TO LIKE 14
MILLION, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
BELIEVE ANYMORE.
BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY HE
SHOWED UP, AND IT'S NOT
JUST THAT HE'S FAMOUS.
ONE OF THE SHOW RUNNERS SAID
THIS, BUT WE KNEW THAT MAISIE
WILLIAMS WAS A BIG FAN, AND FOR
YEARS WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET
THEM ON THE SHOW, AND THIS YEAR
WE FINALLY DID IT.
SHE'S PROBABLY CRAZY FOR HIM,
IT'S A COOL LITTLE SURPRISE.
HE DID A GOOD JOB, GET OFF HIS
ASS.
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
THAT'S AN OLD REFERENCE.
I'M BEGINNING NOW TO SEE WHY.
I'M WITH JOHN, I DID NOT AS
ANYTHING DIFFERENT, BUT IF
IT WAS BEYONC…, IT MIGHT ñ YOU
I'M SAYING?
IF ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE HAVING
A SERIOUS GAME OF THRONES
MOMENT.
ARE YOU SAYING THAT ED SHEERAN
IS BEYONC…?
I'M SAYING HE'S NOT.
I'M SAYING IT WAS A REALLY
FAMOUS PERSON.
APPARENTLY HE'S REALLY FAMOUS.
RIGHT, AND A FIANC…
SHOWS UP IN
THE MIDDLE OF A GAME OF
THRONES AND PERSONAE MIGHT BE A
LITTLE DISTRACTED.
ANYWAY, THE MAIN THING I GOT OUT
OF THIS IS THAT ED SHEERAN
IS WAY TOO SENSITIVE.
IF YOU LIVED IN OUR WORLDS.
I AM ON TWITTER, IT IS MOSTLY
PEOPLE SAYING MEAN THINGS,
BECAUSE ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS
BE MEAN, BUT THEY KNOW IF THEY
DO IT IN PERSON THEY'LL GET
PUNCHED IN THE FACE, SO
THEY DO IT ONLINE.
BY JOHN.
BY ME, OR ANYONE ELSE THAT THEY
WERE MEAN TO.
BUT FOR THE JOB, AND FOR
THINGS OTHER THAN POLITICS ñ
BUT I UNDERSTANDABLY WANT TO
LIKE, PROTECT THEIR SANITY
BY LEAVING IT.
HE'S NOT THE ONLY PERSON LEAVING
IT.
TICKETS OKAY, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE INVOLVED IN IT, YOU
HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO EXPOSE
YOURSELF TO THAT SORT OF
CONCENTRATED INSANITY.
HERE'S THE THING, ED SHEERAN
WILL DO A CAMEO ON THE
SIMPSONS, WHICH IS A SHOW FOR
CAMEOS.
I DON'T THINK THAT THE GAME OF
THRONES IS A SHOW FOR THAT
KIND OF, LIKE, I WAS JUST ON THE
SIMPSONS, AND DANCING WITH
THE STARS, NOW WHAT TO DO MY
CAMEO ON GAME OF THRONES.
IT WAS A STRANGE, ALTHOUGH HE IS
A SUPER TALENTED, EXTREMELY
ñ DESPITE WHAT THEY SAY,
AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW ñ
EXTREMELY POPULAR SINGER,
NOMINATED FOR THE HIGHEST
AWARDS IN THE LAND OF MUSIC.
OKAY, ANYWAY, I PARDON EVERYONE
INVOLVED, AND ONE COMMENT
SHOULD NOT RUIN YOUR DAY.
IT WAS PROBABLY MORE.
I'M WORRIED THIS SETS A
PRECEDENT WHERE PEOPLE WILL
WANT TO DO THESE CAMEOS ANYMORE,
BECAUSE IF YOU DECIDED TO
SURPRISE ME WITH A CAMEO WERE
LIKE, EMMA WATSON HAD A
COUPLE LINES ON TYT, I WOULD
WANT YOU TO DO THAT.
