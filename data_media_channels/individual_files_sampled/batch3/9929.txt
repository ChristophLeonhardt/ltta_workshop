SUPREME COURT DELIVER A COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS IN VIRGINIA. WE WILL MONITOR THIS FOR ANY NEWS THAT COMES OUT OF THE JUSTICES SPEECH. VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE DELIVERING A SPEECH LATER TODAY AS WELL. ELIZABETH: FOUR STATES ARE HOLDING PRIMARY ELECTIONS INCLUDING IOWA, NEBRASKA OREGON AND PENNSYLVANIA.TO HELP US BREAK DOWN SOME OF THE MOST CLOSELY WATCHED RACES IS - - A SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER AT ROLLCALL. I WANT TO GET THROUGH SOME OF THE STATES ON THE WEST COAST IF YOU WILL. NOT REALLY ON THE WEST COAST. IDAHO, NEBRASKA AND OREGON. SIMPLY BECAUSE I WANT TO SPEND MORE TIME ON PENNSYLVANIA. ARE THERE ANY RACES YOU ARE CLOSELY WATCHING IN THOSE THREE STATES? NOT A WHOLE LOT GOING ON EXCEPT THE ONE IN THE RAFTER. A FORMER CONGRESSMAN BRAD ASHFORD LOST IN 2016, WAS TRYING TO WIN HIS OLD SEAT BACK. HE DOES HAVE A PRIMARY ON TUESDAY. HE IS LIKELY TO WIN BUT SEEING THE ANTI-INCUMBENT'S A IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT TO SEE IF HE MAKES IT THROUGH. ELIZABETH: OBVIOUSLY, WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE RUSTBELT. NOW WE'RE TALKING CLOSE TO CLOSE FOCUSING A LOT ON PENNSYLVANIA. SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FACTORS THAT HAVE CHANGED. FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S A LOT OF NEWCOMERS. SECOND OF ALL, THE LINES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY REDRAWN. FOR SOMEONE AT HOME, WHY DOES THAT MATTER? THE DISTRICT ACTUALLY CHANGED BECAUSE OF THE REDISTRICTING. THE STATE SUPREME COURT THROUGHOUT THE CURRENT DISTRICTS AND SAID IT WAS A PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING THAT FAVORED REPUBLICANS SO A LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN REDRAWN TO WHAT THEY SAY IS MORE FAIR. ELIZABETH: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? DOES THAT MEAN PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN NECESSARILY HAD A MUCH WEIGHT HAVE MORE WEIGHT NOW? THE IDEA IS THAT ALL VOTERS THE IDEA IS THAT ALL VOTERS WILL HAVE EQUAL SAY. IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT, YOU WILL STILL HAVE THE REPRESENTATION. SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS UNDER THE 'S ARE SLIGHTLY HIGHER VOTING PERCENTAGE FOR HILLARY CLINTON IN THE 2016 ELECTION SO THEY COULD BE MORE COMPETITIVE GOING INTO 2018. ELIZABETH: LOOKING AHEAD TO TUESDAY, IS THERE IMPACT AFTER THE SPECIAL ELECTION WITH ON THE 18TH DISTRICT THE 18TH DISTRICT, CONOR LAMB BEAT RICK SACCONE WHICH WAS A SURPRISING WIN. HE'S A YOUNG CANDIDATE. ARE THERE A LOT OF YOUNG NEWCOMERS SPECIFICALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA AND WHAT TYPE OF IMPACT WILL THAT HAVE? THERE'S A LOT OF NEWCOMERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THERE'S A LOT OF WOMEN CANDIDATES ESPECIALLY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY OPEN SEATS, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE RETIRING. CHARLIE DENT FOR EXAMPLE. PEOPLE LEAVING BECAUSE OF #METOO SCANDALS. CONOR LAMB AS YOU MENTIONED IS RUNNING AT A NEW SEAT BECAUSE OF REDISTRICTING. HE IS FACING OFF AGAINST AN INCUMBENT CONGRESSMAN IN THE 18TH DISTRICT. ELIZABETH: WHAT ARE YOU SEEING AS FAR AS ISSUES THAT GET BROUGHT UP? WE TALKED A LOT WHEN THE BLAST WAS IN OHIO. THE PRESIDENCY, HOW IS HE GETTING WOVEN INTO THESE CANDIDACIES? CANDIDACIES? IT'S A HUGE DEAL. PRIMARIES, REPUBLICANS RUNNING TO THE RIGHT. EVERYONE TRYING TO BE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BEST FRIEND. ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE RUNNING. IF YOU'RE RUNNING IN THE RUSTBELT, YOU ARE COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS POPULAR BUT YOU TRY TO DISTANCE YOURSELF TOO. IN SOME OF THESE MORE LIBERAL AREAS, YOUR HEARING A LOT MORE FOLKS WERE TRYING TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE PRESIDENT AND ARGUE THEY ARE PART OF THE RESISTANCE WHO WILL OPPOSE HIM IN CONGRESS. ELIZABETH: SOME OF THE RACES ARE GETTING REALLY NASTY. WE CERTAINLY HAD WE CERTAINLY HADTHE SAME CONVERSATION . I'M CURIOUS AS TO THE ADS WE ARE SEEING IN PENNSYLVANIA. IS IT GETTING QUITE AS DOWNRIGHT NITTY-GRITTY AS WE SEE IN STATES LIKE OHIO? I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING AS NASTY AS IN WEST VIRGINIA OR INDIANA. WITH THOSE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES LAST WEEK BUT IT'S STILL EARLY AND I THINK YOU'LL SEE MORE OF THAT AROUND THE COUNTRY AS THINGS GET MORE CONTESTED. ELIZABETH: WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE MORE SURPRISING AT A TUESDAY IF ANYTHING AT ALL? I'M LOOKING TO SEE HOW WOMEN CANDIDATES DO. SO FAR WOMEN CANDIDATES HEAVILY
