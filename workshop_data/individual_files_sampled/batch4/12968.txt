ad nauseam solo so if you've not seen solo yet you're probably not going to because it's not doing very well with the box office which is too bad because I actually really like this movie I thought this movie was was fun I thought it had nothing to do with Han Solo kind of it had a lot of references to Han Solo is sort of a giant reference to Han Solo here so let's start off with the fact that the force awakened in the last Jedi are hot flaming garbage hey they are flaming garbage I said this after the force awakens came out they murdered my childhood because Han Solo was the coolest character in the original series and then they killed him for no reason at all they brought him back just to kill him because Harrison Ford said he want to be killed off so stupid so dumb if you're gonna do nostalgia play what you do is you have everybody have kids and then you have everybody retire off into the distance and that's it okay what you don't do is kill off beloved characters by making them divorced lose her father's we're flying around and there's 67 Durango you know and then they come back just to get murdered by their child like that's so dumb Han Solo was the coolest guy in the galaxy and you turned him into the guy who abandoned his kid when his kid was like 11 and then he runs around being an idiot like it's just it's so stupid yeah the floor so we can still makes me angry so I've gotten over that anger and then I saw Solo and the reason that I got angry after seeing Solo is because once again you cannot kill off a key character and then make three prequels about him which was supposed to be the idea here is this was gonna be a trilogy okay you don't kill off a beloved character for many of us who grew up on these movies and then say let me tell you the backstory of the character we just killed off in the stupidest possible way that's just idiotic beyond that they recast Han Solo right they cast him as alden ehrenreich which is fine I'll Xander like I thought it did a just I think it's very good actor by the way if he's even hail Caeser he's really versatile he does a lot of good things and Donald Glover as Lando works perfectly all this is good there there's a bunch of good things about this movie that are call-outs and I'm not a big fan of the newly the newly minted importance of the dice that are on the Millennium Falcon I mean now it's like every other shot in this movie is the shot of the dice to reunite it with the importance of the force awakens in the last Jedi which is just dumb okay it was never important in the original movies I didn't know there were dice on the Millennium Falcon until I saw force awakens and people made a big deal out of it okay like really I didn't even realize they were dice up there it was supposed to be like a little joke I guess but in any case I'm in any case there to to if they're gonna recast han Solo I guess the objection was that we could recast Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher because they were too iconic and so if we're gonna do movies after Return of the Jedi then those movies had to fast forward to the current age where the actors are and then we have to work within that framework but if you're gonna recast Han Solo as Alden Ehrenreich why didn't you for example just recast Donald Glover as Lando Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo and just recast Mark Hamill everybody will get it right bulik James Bond okay so it's just new person who's coming in he's playing these characters for a new generation that's fine it would been okay people would had a hard time with it at the beginning I probably would've moaned about it a little bit and then if the movie's been really good it would been good instead you get the whole expanded universe of force awakens in last Jedi which are just terrible because again you're fast-forwarding 30 years the rebellion is still the rebellion for some odd reason and everybody's turned into a loser i luke's off on a planet being a loser somewhere and he never had kids they never did anything useful and you've got Rey who no one cares about he got Finn who no one cares about he got Poe who no one cares about and he got han Solo getting killed like a loser Luke like astral projecting himself and then dying out of exhaustion which is just ridiculous and then you got Carrie Fisher who actually is dead now and you're stuck because she's dead right in real life so what they could have done and I think this would've been so much better because I've talked up the Star Wars books before I've talked up the novels that we used to be part of the Canon after Star Wars after the Death Star is destroyed in Return of the Jedi there is still an entire empire out there it's not like the entire Empire was on the Death Star I did a story the first step the first Death Star in the entire Empire was still around in the books there's a guy named Admiral Thrawn who comes along and he starts to reconstitute the Empire then you could write a continuation the universe could recast everybody and you could have just continued from there and it would have been really cool and really interesting in the books Leia ends up having twins with Han the twin there's this whole thing or whether the twins have the force or not Luke ends up getting married like there's a lot more stuff that happens in that series then basically them just hanging out and being losers for 30 years which is what happens beginning with the force awakens so the point is if you're you could go one of two directions either you could recast everybody or you could fast-forward 60 years and then just don't pay attention to the old characters because killing them off one by one is a real attempt to destroy it to use nostalgia to destroy my childhood and I really object to it okay so that is objection number one objection to solo the movie is that the Alden Ehrenreich character really doesn't have much to do with solo so he has his backstory I don't think Han Solo needed a backstory I think they're adding this in an attempt to to add to the backstory the problem with Han Solo's character in this film is that I think what they're trying to do and maybe they were they were gonna get there with the trilogy but that may never happen now they're trying to show how an optimistic sprightly young lad kind of a Luke Skywalker figure ends up like Han Solo so it's not that Han is naturally cynical it's that Han used to be really ideal idealistic and all this sort of stuff and then on and then Han became cynical but this movie doesn't show how he becomes cynical this movie just has him still being idealistic like he and Luke Skywalker are much more similar than the Alden Ehrenreich Han Solo and the and the Han Solo Han Solo that we've come to know and love Lando is played exactly right Donald Glover he gets that on the nose the script writing for Han is little flawed there are some things about the movie that I love I mean the way that they have Han and Chewie meat is really great like that really works and it's really funny and it's really good I think Woody Harrelson does a good job in the film there's a whole weird kind of sjw side plot with robot rights that I'm not sure if they were supposed to be playing for laughs or whether they were supposed to be playing it seriously but I don't really have a problem with them with the movie in fact one things I liked about the movie is that finally they actually cast a human being as the bad guy right Paul Bettany plays the bad guy and he's actually a human he's not like a weird-looking creeper so that's kind of easily just a human looking creeper so that's kind of that's kind of good um Emilia Clarke can't act her way out of a paper bag which is unfortunate but if you've ever watched Game of Thrones you know this which is one of the reasons that that Daenerys Targaryen can never end up on the foot on the on the throne at the end of Game of Thrones if she does it's a complete disappointment but in any case what they really needed to do with the and the end of this movie so spoiler alerts now I really haven't spoiled a lot yet spoiler alert now okay the the real what what they should have done at the end of the movie is they should have had the rebellion right the people who are working with the rebellion accidentally kill Han Solo's love interest and then you could see why he's so cynical about the rebellion and also why he's cynical about love right that would have done it but maybe there maybe that's their plan in future movies but I'm not sure they're gonna do future movies because this movie is gonna lose hand over fist at the box office it's only ended up clearing about four hundred million dollars which sounds like 500 million dollars maybe with groped with foreign returns that means that it doesn't break even because they spent several hundred million dollars on the making of the film on the marketing of the film it's hard to see where they go from here Kathleen Kennedy has done a terrible job steering the Star Wars universe rogue one was a very good movie some was a pretty good movie and the fact that they did what they did with force awakens in the last Jedi is impossible to get over it's impossible because now you either have to make a nostalgia play for characters you killed off in the worst possible way or you have to make spin-offs about characters you don't care about like Poe Dameron and venerate look what they really should have done again what they should have done is they should have instead of relaunching if they're gonna do a Marvel style instead of relaunching with force awakens in last Jedi they should have relaunched with rogue one and solo and then they should have moved forward from right after Return of the Jedi or fast forward in 60 years when everybody's already presumed dead basically and then moved on into the new Star Wars universe instead they decided to capitalize on this salchow as a short sighted play and it has some really negative ramifications for this movie which i think is quite good I think that you know I've been kind of arguing whether this is better than Revenge of the Sith I think it's better than Revenge of the Sith on second thought so my current Star Wars rankings are in order Empire Strikes Back episode 4 rogue 1 return to the Jedi solo Revenge of the Sith everything else is hot garbage that's that's the those are the official Star Wars rankings here on the bench Shapiro show and anyone who disagrees will be summarily fired
