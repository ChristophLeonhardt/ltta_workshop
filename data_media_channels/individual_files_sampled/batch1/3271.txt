everybody has her their own personal favorite when it comes to weapons I like the harley-davidson of pistols the 1911 yeah its obsolete there's better technology out there probably if I could only carry one gun overseas it would probably be a Glock 19 because of the reliability and the availability of 9-millimeter ammunition when it comes to assault rifles or battle rifles there's a number of different options out there I always did like the scar although a lot of guys didn't like it because the reciprocating charging handle the foldable stock tore some things that a lot of soldiers didn't like but me personally I thought it was a pretty good option these days in this day and age there's a lot of high technology out there and all kinds of gadgets and everything strapped to the rifle but as time went on in my military career and even in my civilian career that's taken me to war zones I find that really the ak-47 is the weapon of choice that's really the gun to carry 95% of the missions that you can dock can be done with a basic ak-47 so all that extra high-tech infrared lasers and things like that I think it's great that our soldiers have them they're very helpful some of them really changed the game for for our troops over there but oh and all I like to keep it simple
