AND WE HELD THOSE FLAMES OUT IN 

189
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:15,514
FRONT OF US TO SHOW A TRIBUTE TO

190
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:17,984
THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES 

191
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,387
OF THIS HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE 

192
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:21,788
EVENT.

193
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,290
AND AT THAT MOMENT, DESPITE HOW 

194
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,127
DARK AND COLD IT WAS, I SAW AND 

195
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,729
WE ALL SAW THAT THE GREATEST 

196
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,998
DARKNESS CAN'T PUT OUT THE 

197
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:33,900
SMALLEST LIGHT.

198
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,169
AND WE COLLECTIVELY FELT FOR THE

199
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,338
FIRST TIME THE FIRST PANGS OF 

200
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:39,839
HOPE.

201
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,907
WE SAW THAT DESPITE THE SADNESS 

202
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:43,375
AND GRIEF ALL AROUND US THAT 

203
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,044
WE'RE RESILIENT AND WE'RE 

204
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,044
COMMITTED TO FIGHT AND RECOVER 

205
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:49,315
AND BEGIN THE LONG PROCESS OF 

206
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:49,649
HEALING.

207
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,517
AS NEVADANS WE HAVE A LONG 

208
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,753
HISTORY OF PULLING TOGETHER.

209
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,189
AND YES, WE'RE HURT.

210
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,356
WE'RE HURT BADLY.

211
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,626
BUT WE'RE NOT BROKEN.

212
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,261
AS I SAID, WE HAVE SEEN 

213
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,030
GENEROSITY ON A SCALE THAT IS 

214
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,098
UNPRECEDENTED IN NEVADA HISTORY.

215
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:09,702
WE KNOW, WE KNOW THAT WE WILL 

216
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,903
NEVER, EVER FORGET THIS HORRIFIC

217
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:11,537
EVENT.

218
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,973
BUT WE WILL MARCH FORWARD AS A 

219
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,574
FAMILY.

220
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,808
GIVEN EACH OTHER COMFORT, 

221
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,978
SUPPORT, AND LOVE.

222
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,613
THE FUTURE'S GOING TO COME ONE 

223
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,348
DAY AT A TIME.

224
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,251
WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE HOW WE'RE 

225
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,654
GOING TO LIVE EACH DAY.

226
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,289
WE MUST BE GLAD.

227
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,225
WE MUST BE GOOD.

228
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,425
WE MUST BE BRAVE.

229
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:36,128
AND WE MUST HAVE FAITH.

230
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:38,697
AND WE WILL EMERGE AS A 

231
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:42,201
STRONGER, KINDER, BETTER STATE 

232
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,035
AND NATION.

233
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,471
SO GOD BLESS THE VICTIMS AND 

234
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,473
THEIR FAMILIES.

235
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,743
MAY THEY GIVE THEM PEACE.

236
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,711
GOD BLESS OUR GREAT STATE, AND 

237
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:54,413
GOD BLESS OUR NATION, THE 

238
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,147
GREATEST NATION ON EARTH.

239
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:58,484
AND WITH THAT, I'M VERY 

240
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,553
PRIVILEGED AND HONORED TO

ENFORCEMENT.

296
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,938
IN THE DEPTHS OF HORROR, WE WILL

297
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,539
ALWAYS FIND HOPE IN THE MEN AND 

298
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,477
WOMEN WHO RISK THEIR LIVES FOR

00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:04,777
OURS.

300
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,378
THE MASS MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE 

301
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:10,349
ON SUNDAY NIGHT FILLS AMERICA'S 

302
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,218
HEART WITH GRIEF.

303
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:16,155
AMERICA IS TRULY A NATION IN 

304
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,590
MOURNING.

305
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,525
I VISITED THE HOSPITAL EARLIER 

306
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,694
TODAY WHERE MANY VICTIMS ARE 

307
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,397
STILL RECOVERING FROM THEIR 

308
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,498
WOUNDS, AND WE ASK GOD TO EASE 

309
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:29,435
THEIR SUFFERING AND TO SPEED 

310
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,202
THEIR HEALING.

311
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,972
WE PRAY FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE 

312
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,107

313
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,977
OFFICERS WHO SO BRAVELY THREW 

314
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,579
THEMSELVES INTO DANGER WHEN DUTY

315
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:41,113
CALLED.

316
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,748
AND WE GRIEVE THE LOSS OF THE 

317
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:47,319
LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL WHO 

318
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:50,389
WERE KILLED IN THIS VICIOUS 

319
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,224
ATTACK.

320
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,125
MANY FAMILIES TONIGHT WILL GO TO

321
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,563
BED IN A WORLD THAT IS SUDDENLY 

322
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:57,763
EMPTY.

323
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,031
THE PEOPLE THEY SO DEARLY LOVE 

324
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:02,835
WERE TORN AWAY FROM THEM 

325
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,270
FOREVER.

326
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,405
OUR SOULS ARE STRICKEN WITH 

327
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:10,042
GRIEF FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO 

328
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,110
LOST A HUSBAND OR A WIFE, A 

329
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,080
MOTHER OR A FATHER, A SON OR A 

330
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,413
DAUGHTER.

331
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,950
WE KNOW THAT YOUR SORROW FEELS 

332
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,417
ENDLESS.

333
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,519
WE STAND TOGETHER TO HELP YOU 

334
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,154
CARRY YOUR PAIN.

335
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,024
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

336
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:29,128
WE WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIDE.

337
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,729
HERE AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, 

338
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:33,799
WE REMEMBER ONE OF OUR OWN WHO 

339
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,669
DIED THIS WEEK.

340
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,236
CHARLES HARTFELT.

341
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:43,409
HE WAS A VERY, VERY SPECIAL 

342
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:43,776
PERSON.

343
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,544
OFFICER HARTFIELD WAS A PROUD 

344
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,413
VETERAN, A DEVOTED HUSBAND, A 

345
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:49,515
LOVING FATHER.

346
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,551
HIS DEATH IS A TRAGIC LOSS FOR 

347
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,053
THIS POLICE FORCE, FOR THIS 

348
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,156
CITY, AND FOR OUR GREAT NATION.

349
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,191
WE STRUGGLE FOR THE WORDS TO 

350
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,128
EXPLAIN TO OUR CHILDREN HOW SUCH

351
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,431
EVIL CAN EXIST, HOW THERE CAN BE

352
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,700
SUCH CRUELTY AND SUCH SUFFERING.

353
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,668
BUT WE CANNOT BE DEFINED BY THE 

354
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:14,173
EVIL THAT THREATENS US OR THE 

355
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,575
VIOLENCE THAT INCITES SUCH 

356
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:16,942
TERROR.

357
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,312
WE'RE DEFINED BY OUR LOVE, OUR 

358
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,147
CARING, AND OUR COURAGE.

359
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:25,818
IN THE DARKEST MOMENTS, WHAT 

360
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,320
SHINES MOST BRIGHTLY IS THE 

361
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,254
GOODNESS THAT THRIVES IN THE 

362
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:30,122
HEARTS OF OUR PEOPLE.

363
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,292
THAT GOODNESS IS OUR LIGHTHOUSE 

364
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,462
AND OUR SOLACE IS KNOWLEDGE THAT

365
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,331
THE SOULS OF THOSE WHO PASSED 

366
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:44,270
ARE NOW AT PEACE IN HEAVEN.

367
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,472
HERE ON EARTH, WE ARE BLESSED TO

368
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:50,709
BE SURROUNDED BY HEROES, AS ONE 

369
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,878
EYEWITNESS RECOUNTED THIS WEEK, 

370
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,413
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE WAS 

371
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,747
CROUCHING, POLICE OFFICERS WERE 

372
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:58,818
STANDING UP AS TARGETS, JUST 

373
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,653
TRYING TO DIRECT PEOPLE AND TELL

374
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,822
THEM WHERE TO GO.

375
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,157
THE OFFICERS WERE STANDING UP IN

376
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,826
THE LINE OF FIRE TO HELP THOSE 

377
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:10,329
IN DANGER AND TO FIND OUT WHERE 

378
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,200
THOSE HORRIBLE SHOTS WERE COMING

379
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,800
FROM.

380
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,402
WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THE 

381
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:20,439
BRAVERY THAT THE WHOLE WORLD 

382
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,142
WITNESSED ON SUNDAY NIGHT.

383
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:28,013
AMERICANS DEFIED DEATH AND 

384
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:37,756
HATRED WITH LOVE AND WITH 

385
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,693
WHEN THE WORST OF HUMANITY 

386
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,494
STRIKES, AND STRIKE IT DID, THE 

387
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:45,631
BEST OF HUMANITY RESPONDS.

388
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,900
PARENTS AND SPOUSES USE THEIR 

389
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,300
OWN BODIES AS SHIELDS TO PROTECT

390
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,604
THEIR LOVED ONES MUCH AMERICANS 

391
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,307
DASHED INTO A HAIL OF BULLETS TO

00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,210

HORRIBLE MOMENT.

396
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,456
THAT HORRIBLE NIGHT.

00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:31,777
HOSPITAL.

405
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,345
WITHIN MINUTES HE JOINED A GROUP

406
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:37,916
OF OFFICERS RUSHING BETWEEN 

407
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,952
FLYING BULLETS TO CLEAR THE FAIR

408
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,855
GROUND AND SAVE LIVES.

409
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,023
OFFICER GURLEY WAS OFF DUTY 

410
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:46,825
ATTENDING THE CONCERT, ALTHOUGH 

411
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,294
SHE WAS UNARMED AS SOON AS THE 

412
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:52,331
SHOOTING BEGAN SHE THREW ON A 

413

YELLOW POLICE VEST AND BEGAN 

414
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:57,236
EVACUATING THE VICTIMS.

415
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:02,674
AND AARON STALKER, A VETERAN, 

416
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:04,109
RUSHED TO THE SCENE TO SEARCH 

417
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,844
FOR HIS LOVED ONES.

418
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,412
WHEN HE COULDN'T FIND THEM, HE 

419
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:09,214
BEGAN HELPING EVERY PERSON HE 

420
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:09,447
COULD.

421
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:12,685
AS HE RECOUNTS, WE USED THE 

422
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,385
PLASTIC BARRIERS AS GURNEYS TO 

423
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,855

425
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:18,824
I MADE SPLINTS OUT OF WHATEVER I

426
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:24,463
COULD FIND AND USED ANYTHING TO 

427
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,097
STOP THE HORRIBLE BLEEDING.

428
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,599
AMONG THE WOUNDED WAS THE MOTHER

429
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,268
OF AARON'S GIRLFRIEND.

430
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,938
SHE IS STILL IN THE HOSPITAL AND

431
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,773
WE ARE ALL PULLING FOR HER.

00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,075

NATION THANKS YOU.

436
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,422
THE EXAMPLE OF THOSE WHOSE FINAL

437
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:54,827
ACT WAS TO SACRIFICE THEMSELVES 

438
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,428
FOR THOSE THEY LOVED, SHOULD 

439
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,631
INSPIRE ALL OF US TO SHOW MORE 

440
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:00,899
LOVE EVERY DAY FOR THE PEOPLE 

441
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,135
WHO GRACE OUR LIVES.

442
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,104
IN THE MONTHS AHEAD, WE WILL ALL

443
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,640
HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH THE HORROR 

444
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,043
OF WHAT HAS UNFOLDED THIS WEEK, 

445
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,946
BUT WE WILL STRUGGLE THROUGH IT 

446
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:14,213
TOGETHER.

447
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,781

448
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,951
TOGETHER, AND WE WILL OVERCOME 

449
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:23,822
TOGETHER AS AMERICANS.

450
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,358
MAY GOD BLESS AND WATCH OVER 

451
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,360

WE SAW THERE.

478
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,579
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM

00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,081
PUERTO RICO YESTERDAY, THE 

480
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,416

485
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,723
FROM PUERTO RICO, AFTER TEXAS, 

486
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:34,025
AFTER FLORIDA, THIS IS A VERY 

487
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:35,227
DIFFERENT TONE THAT WE ARE 

488
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,161

489
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:36,361

WE ARE A NATION IN MOURNING.

491
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,299
THIS IS THE JOB OF PRESIDENTS.

492
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,933
THIS IS THE CONSOLER IN CHIEF, 

493
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,936
THE COMFORTER IN CHIEF IF YOU 

494
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,604

PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY LEAVE 

499
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,215

500
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,983
THEY WILL GO ON AIR FORCE ONE 

501
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,184
AND HEAD BACK TO THE WHITE 

502
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,919
HOUSE, WHERE NOW THE NEXT STEP 

503
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,154
FOR THIS PRESIDENT WILL BE TO 

504
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,321
HAVE TO TAKE ON THIS ISSUE OF 

505
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:05,491
GUN CONTROL.

506
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,825
AND IN THE LAST FEW DAYS THIS IS

507
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,027
NOT AN ISSUE THAT THIS WHITE 

508
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:10,829
HOUSE HAS BEEN WILLING TO TALK 

509
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,564
ABOUT, IT'S PREMATURE TO 

510
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,199
POLITICIZE THIS ISSUE, WHILE 

511
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,333
THIS INVESTIGATION IS STILL 

512
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,800
GOING ON RIGHT HERE BEHIND ME, 

513
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,769
RIGHT HERE IN LAS VEGAS.

514
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:18,869
IT'S NOT SOMETHING HE'S GOING TO

515
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,105
BE ABLE TO AVOID.

516
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,673
WE SAW PROTESTS BY DEMOCRATS ON 

517
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,642
CAPITOL HILL, AND IF THE TALKING

518
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,044
POINTS THAT ABC NEWS HAS SEEN AT

519
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:26,811
THIS WHITE HOUSE IS FLOATING 

520
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,378
AROUND RIGHT NOW, IS ANY 

521
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:30,349
INDICATION OF WHICH WAY THIS 

522
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,551
ADMINISTRATION MIGHT GO, YOU 

523
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,753
KNOW, THEY SAY NEW LAWS WON'T 

524
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:35,821
STOP MAD MEN.

525
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,022
SO PERHAPS THAT'S A SIGN OF 

526
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,323
THINGS TO COME, CERTAINLY THIS 

527
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,858
IS A DEBATE THAT WAGES ON, AND 

528
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:40,359
IT'S IN THE LAP OF THIS 

529
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,894
PRESIDENT.

530
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,462
>> A DESCRIPTION BY THE

MATT HAS BEEN THERE SINCE EARLY 

534
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:51,770
THIS MORNING.

535
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,370
THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T SAY 

536
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:52,971
ANYTHING ABOUT THE GUNMAN IN 

537
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:57,743
THAT SETTING RIGHT THERE.

538
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,445
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE LEARNED MUCH 

539
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:02,681
MORE ABOUT HIS FINAL 48 HOURS IN

540
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,182
THAT HOTEL.

541
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,584
AND THE METICULOUS PLANNING THAT

542
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,684
WENT INTO THIS MASSACRE.

543
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:08,287
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE, WE KNOW

544
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,856
THAT IN ADDITION TO THE 23 

545
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,257
FIREARMS, THAT THOUSANDS OF 

546
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,459
ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, HE SET UP 

547
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:16,828
AT LEAST TWO SURVEILLANCE 

548
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:18,430
CAMERAS, HE MAY HAVE HAD A 

549
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,066
TABLET DEVICES HE WAS ABLE TO 

550
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:21,299
MONITOR.

551
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,202
THE POINT WAS TO MONITOR THE 

552
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,970
APPROACH OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE 

553
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,538
SAW, NINE MINUTES INTO THE 

554
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,139
SHOOTING, WHEN A SECURITY GUARD 

555
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:29,942
FROM THE HOTEL APPROACHED THE 

556
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,777
