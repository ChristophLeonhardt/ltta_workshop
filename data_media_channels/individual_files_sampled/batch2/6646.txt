wait a little bit of news that's almost kind of good news you know what we did it turns out Donald Trump and the Democrats made a deal and a deal that makes sense Wow see that coming it was on the debt ceiling and I thought for sure that Donald Trump would screw this up the Republicans wanted him to screw it up so it was a recipe for disaster but he didn't so Paul Ryan had said earlier Oh raising the debt ceiling for a short term for a short period of time and combining it with hurricane Harvey relief aid that is quote ridiculous and disgraceful idea okay well I honesty so what happened yesterday during a meeting with congressional leaders the White House on Wednesday President Donald Trump back to a proposal from Democrats that I ate for gain Harvey to a 3-month debt limit increase huh and a short term government funding bill through December much the reported consternation of congressional Republicans that's kind of Awesome so he had the Republicans in the room he's like no I don't think so I'm gonna go with Nancy and Chuck Harry in fact let me give you more details Jake Sherman reports Trump agrees to three-month debt limit increase in meeting with hill leaders all GOP leaders were opposed / multiple sources interesting so the exact thing that Paul Ryan said was ridiculous in this race ball is the one that apparently they made the deal on even though there were Republicans of room going don't do it McConnell who was also in the room Mitch McConnell Senate Majority Leader total reporters at Trump Beach a deal with Schumer and Pelosi in the meeting with congressional leaders today so there he's confirming it so one more here from Talking Points Memo Trump's decision aside with Democrats left conservers fuming Senator Tom Tillis Republican over North Carolina described a deal as fiscal malpractice and the conservative Heritage Foundation blasted two proposals political cowardice damn so I love it now if that wasn't bad enough a more conservative heads are about to explode President Trump and Senate Minority Leader Charlotte Charles Schumer have agree to pursuit a deal that would permanently remove the requirement that Congress Lee repeatedly raised the debt ceiling three people familiar with the decision said so now look the debt ceiling is nonsense it's after we have already gotten the debt we're saying should we pay it or should we not pay of course we should pay it it was ridiculous that they played politics under Obama the Republicans did and now the Democrats are saying we won't do likewise we won't play politics let's just raise it in fact maybe let's just get rid of it even though it would give us leverage over you and Trump's leg all right great then I don't have to deal with this nonsense and they might have a deal about that but the people who like to play politics with it are Republican Congressmen and they say oh they're all outrage town Telesis Heritage Foundation Paul Ryan he thinks it's a bad idea and and the reason is every time debt ceiling comes up they know that we have to lift it otherwise it's going to destroy the Full Faith and Credit of the United States that might mess with the markets completely so they use it as a hostage to demand tax cuts for the rich spending cuts for middle-class Americans etc etc so when they saw that Trump might even do a deal not only to deal you already did but one to get rid of the decimal together this was their reaction heads exploding all right or from the Washington Post now the two along with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi agreed to work together over the next several months to try to finalize a plan which would need to be approved by Congress not only is he thinking of getting rid of the debt ceiling altogether he's working with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi Republican reaction not only that there was a picture taken I don't know how they get these pictures who was the creeper hanging out writing for right outside the Oval Office and why isn't the Secret Service removed - anyway they got this picture of Donald Trump and Chuck Schumer smiling together and Trump almost hugging Schumer Republican reaction fun for everybody except the Republicans if you like The Young Turks you'll love Young Turks membership TYT Network concise joy
