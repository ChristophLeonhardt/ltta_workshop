research and like taking his advice in

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,590
the mind i found out that i actually was

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,699
it should wait a little longer in

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,610
between twists and also after visiting

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,360

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sage and rosemead look really cool</font>

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,890
so definitely not try<font color="#CCCCCC"> that which led me</font>

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,500
to start thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about just like the</font>

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,489
dreadlock community in general<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

20
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,649
it's really cool how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find</font>

21
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,750
so many like-minded people on<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube</font>

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have similar hair of yours and like</font>

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,539
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> expand and learn so much based on</font>

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,309
like what other people have done the

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,510
knowledge that they found and they're

26
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,550
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of passing it on and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

27
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really great um being from Texas</font>

28
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,220
it's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much natural hair</font>

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,520
it's changed as far as a social norm

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,240
goes I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when I first decided to</font>

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,430
wanted to get dreads almost everyone

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,400
everyone in my family was like no and I

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,140
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was for good reason you know my</font>

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,439
dad my dad was<font color="#E5E5E5"> always like uh I mean</font>

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,659
you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nappy people are gonna</font>

36
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,000
like that no one's gonna hire<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,119
because your nappy and you know and it's

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">like in his time yeah that would have</font>

39
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the case but now not so much I</font>

40
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's really cool hell the world is</font>

41
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,990
slowly starting to embrace it all and

42
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,920
especially when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go to a</font>

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,320
community like YouTube and find out so

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,880
much information I think it's so

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,799
beautiful and so to the dreadlock

46
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,270
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to say keep it up</font>

47
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,829
keep doing what you're doing because

48
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,590
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool for someone who maybe</font>

49
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,270
might not be surrounded by as many

50
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,719
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are natural such as myself</font>

51
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,038
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to join</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with like-minded</font>

52
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,099
African American people Dougie be wrong

53
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,540

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,849
not African it's awesome as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

55
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:18,209
it's like in Texas just a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

56
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:20,849
stigma people a lot of women's to look

57
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,819

62
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,239
what you're doing like going<font color="#E5E5E5"> natural</font>

63
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,760
unlike keeping your hair the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">and just working with what you have it's</font>

65
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,959
so beautiful it's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool but then it's</font>

66
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,099
like that your own community<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

people of all races in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,720
come together with a certain like-minded

72
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,900
belief system and share what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know</font>

73
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,609
