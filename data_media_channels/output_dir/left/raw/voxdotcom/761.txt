00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,870
Kevin Spacey grew up in California, but in
House of Cards, he plays a politician from

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,900
South Carolina. "As we used to say in Gaffney..."
The first thing you'll notice about Spacey's

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,219
accent when he's playing Frank Underwood is
what happens to a lot of his Rs. "Money is

4
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:19,750
the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling
apart after 10 years. Power..." This is called

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,939
r-dropping, and it's a feature of several
well-known dialects. "He would rather the

6
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,960
poor were poorer." "The greatest wilderness
on Earth." "In the tradition of bipartisanship."

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,810
"Metropolitan Museum of Art." But it's also
associated with the upper class of the plantation

8
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,350
South. "This war talk's spoiling all the fun
at every party this spring." R-dropping emerged

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,000
as kind of an affectation among posh people
in southern Britain in the 18th century -- the

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,460
English didn't always talk that way. And then
it spread to elites on the East Coast of the

11
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,940
US. At the same time, r-dropping was a feature
of the creole and West African languages spoken

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,330
by some of the slaves in the South and their
descendants. But after World War II, new generations

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,599
of white Southerners essentially abandoned
r-dropping, so today you'll see it mostly

14
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:10,430
in the very oldest generation, or more frequently
with African-American speakers from the South.

15
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,250
Take Lindsey Graham as an example. Like Kevin
Spacey's character, Graham is from the northern

16
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:21,220
part of South Carolina, and his Rs are largely
intact. "going to sell the oil to another

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,630
customer." And that may be because language
in the Southern Appalachian areas was influenced

18
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:32,320
by settlers from Ireland, where people aren't
exactly shy with their Rs. "Seriously. Serious.

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,320
How close does that sound to the Kentucky
accent where they talk like that and I'm talking

20
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,780
like this?" Regardless, R-dropping probably
can't be the shortcut that white actors use

21
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,290
to sound Southern in the future. Instead,
the main feature that unites Southern dialects

22
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:53,560
is something called /ay/-ungliding. For people
outside the South, this vowel has two parts.

23
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,420
You can probably feel your tongue shifting
as you say the word "buy." But in Southern

24
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:05,420
speech, /ay/ is a one-part vowel in many cases,
sounding more like ah than ay. "Five" "and

25
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,999
livelihoods" "terrified." But there's an important
distinction here that Northerners might not

26
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:15,930
be aware of. Most Southerners only do ay-ungliding
before what's called voiced consonants, or

27
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,409
at the end of a word. The difference between
voiced and voiceless consonants is whether

28
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:26,420
your vocal chords vibrate when you say them,
and ay-ungliding before voiceless consonants

29
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,540
is stereotyped in the South as a less-educated
way of speaking. "But I don't want your life."

30
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,669
Ay-ungliding triggers a shift in the vowels,
or in the space in the mouth where the vowels

31
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:42,510
are formed. The ey-sound shifts lower in the
mouth. "And then blame somebody else." The

32
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,919
eh-sound moves forward to the front of the
mouth. "Just as strong and opinionated as

33
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:53,829
men." As do the vowels pronounced in the back
of the mouth like go and boot. "Thank you."

34
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:57,629
These vowel shifts occur to different degrees
in different parts of the South, and they're

35
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:02,709
certainly fading in cities where there's a
lot of migration and generational change.

36
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:06,509
But if you're an actor from the North or the
West, the vowels are really the key 

37
00:03:06,509 --> 00:00:00,000
to sounding Southern.
