usually the first thing when people find out of a mind the first question they ask is why my name is phil bowers and i am a mind you have energy and this imaginary world has energy and where the two things come together is an illusion that's where the imagination of the audience joins you your imagination be stairs and together you create so if your hands on a wall to push up so you let your body come in and then use the love when an audience is allowed to really sit and receive information in another way maybe in a nonverbal way where you're taking information in through your collaboration imaginatively you know in pantomime the audience is really participating and helping see what you're trying to create an illusion look at that yeah do that a couple times to send it back and forth and what you're doing is is great because you're watching what you're doing and that's really helpful for an audience what I find is people are incredibly moved that's the overall Connecticut is that people will say hey I didn't think I liked mind and B I had no idea I would be so emotional by this so I think silence has incredible power that would we think of silent spaces churches temples libraries you know it's places where people are contemplating and sitting with themselves which there's less and less opportunity to do that in our culture and it's it's a vulnerable place to put yourself I was on Broadway during the Lion King when it first began I was playing as a zoo the bird it was a big hit and we were doing a lot of I mean eight shows a week and lots of other special events and I ended up injuring my hands I was in the hospital for a period of time my hands were in these big foam rubber boxes and I was watching the news and it was a story about Marcel Marceau going on his 80th birthday world tour Marcel Marceau was in so many ways synonymous with mime he was invited on a number of live broadcast and that brought mime this artform into people's living rooms and he would continue to appear on TV and in film and so he just had a huge influence on bringing what mime was out to them to the masses and I had one of those light bulb moments I just thought if I'm ever going to study with him I need to do that and so I would leave The Lion King I went up with Marcel Marceau for the next four parts of the next three years and the year after that he died so I was very glad I took Philippe it's such a unique art and particularly in the u.s. there's so few people doing it one of the things Marceau really stressed was that if you don't pass it on body to body it'll disappear it'll just go away so I took that kind of as my mission and I've been on the road ever since in New York City there's a handful of us that are working as mines and I think part of the what's changed is that since Marcel Marceau died which was 10 years ago this month he was kind of the hub of the wheel and there's no there's no there there anymore and so I think modern mine is has to kind of reformulate and and find what it's going to be next I'm confident it will continue on I think it might change shape you know we see a lot of mime technique in freestyle dance and hip hop downs which i think is fantastic I just think it's it's moving forward in some new ways
