if you eat meat you are a Nazi and maybe a pedophile but I'll close today with a really great story to send you into the weekend all of that coming up today on the rebel buzz it's Friday and that means it's time for the rebel buzz where I cover three stories that I think are important enough to cover further if I have already covered them or stories that I might have missed but of course if I hand-picked them then you were going to find them interesting too first up today actress Natalie Portman talked about a traitor to her roots she's Israeli born in Jerusalem and I recently covered her when she by proxy showed support for the BDS movement and refused to accept an award in Israel for her contributions to her professional field as an actress you know her from Black Swan V for Vendetta and Jackie the biopic about Jackie Kennedy and apparently now she's starring in a PETA ad that's People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals now keep in mind what I told you about her being Israeli because that's going to exacerbate your incredulity as you hear what I'm about to tell you about this ad the commercial is littered with quotes from Isaac Bashevis singer and a few of his books the slaughterer and Shousha the comparisons being made and these quotes are connecting the atrocities of the Holocaust with wait for it eating meat I wish I was kidding so here are a few quotes she opens with this introduction nowadays many of us speak up for animals but it wasn't always like this decades ago one man articulated the plight of animals sold so boldly that the modern world couldn't ignore him and here comes the kicker quotes we do to God's creatures what the Nazis did to us as long as people will shed the blood of innocent creatures there can be no peace no Liberty no Harmony slaughter and justice cannot dwell together one of the slogans for this PETA campaign is for animals all people are Nazis so how do you feel about being called a Nazi for eating meat and coming from an Israeli who no doubt is the descendant of or if it has a family number of Jews killed in the Holocaust as you know I just returned from Israel with some of the other rebels and our last day was spent at Yad Vashem the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem and let me tell you these Nazi comparisons have always been absurd but having so recently been immersed in that experience at Yad Vashem I find this comparison to be disgusting and frankly unforgivable you all know that I am big on boycotting I think it's one of the most effective ways that we can speak our minds and make our voices heard so let me tell you I will not put another dime in this woman's pocket ever again and I hope that you will join me and it seems like we have a running theme today with nasty and ignorant comparisons a German medical student delivered a TEDx talk at the University of würzburg in Germany in which she compares pedophilia with someone's unchangeable sexual orientation like heterosexuality so to sum this up your hetero cisgender tendencies are no more natural than the propensity to sexualize and fondle or what we call in this country assault a ten-year-old what the hell is happening to our world we often express concern over slippery slopes and this is exactly why because you have TEDx speakers people who get millions of views and are considered to be thought leaders in their field people like this telling a crowd that basically pedophilia is perfectly fine the students name is Miriam Heine and the title of her speech was why our perception of pedophilia has to change the theme of her speech is that pedophilia is a natural tendency she does differentiate between an attraction to children and molesting them but says that the difference between pedophilia and other sexual orientations is that living out this sexual orientation will end in disaster I'm so glad you recognized that miss Heine she then goes on to suggest that we need to soften our feelings for Petofi pedophiles aka cut them some slack you guys life is hard when you want to grope a preteen you know no that's not a hard life that's a sexually deviant evil backwards and criminal life and what's dangerous about this is that people read psychological arguments or and hear speeches like this or in the psych field they hear their peers and professors talk about how we need to foster positive relationships and reap benefits when it's a loving relationship and their minds will adjust they'll read a study and because there's a study about it well I mean it must be true right and before you know it liberal society will teach and preach that people like you and me people who believe that this is deviant ly and heinous ly evil we will be called bigots and petty phobes that is where this leads okay I don't want to send you into the weekend with those two depressing stories so last but best out of my home state in my hometown a really really awesome story from start to finish people love to propagate the stereotype that southern states in the United States are racist but that simply could not be more inaccurate this story is about people who are from my hometown people like this these these are the people I know this is what I know of the south loving benevolent hospitable people that is Alabama a young man named Walter Carr got a job with a moving company called bellhops Carr and his mother moved to Alabama from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina destroyed their home unfortunately the day before his first day on the job with bellhops his car bit the dust but instead of calling out of work he decided to look up the location of the job and walk there the moving job was at a home in Pelham Alabama which is on the other side of Birmingham from where he lives so Carr figures out that the walk would take him most of the night so he set out on foot at midnight around 4:00 a.m. after walking 14 miles police officer stopped him now here's where you would expect that fo Alabama racism to sneak its way into the story but you would be wrong after hearing Carr's story the officers took him to breakfast and then drove him to the home where he would be moving boxes and furniture for the Lamy family when car arrives at the home Jenny Hayden Lamy asked car if he'd like to go upstairs and rest until the other movers arrived but Carr insisted that he wanted to go ahead and get the process going and start working so the Laney family and walter car started packing things up and throughout the process the lamby we learned about car situation Lamy shared the story about car on her facebook page and the post went viral now Birmingham is not a small city but like most southern towns even if you don't know someone you probably know someone who knows someone's brother whose aunt did the flowers for that person sister's wedding and before you know it everyone pretty much knows everyone so word got out quickly and made its way to the ears of the CEO of bellhops moving company Luke märklin Marklin felt like a simple thank you was not enough so he decided to show his gratitude and reward cars perseverance on Monday Marklin the Laney family the police officers and others gathered as Marklin gifted car with the 2014 Ford Escape so well the rest of the country is comparing meat eaters to Nazis and healthy sexuality to pedophilia the South with its abounding acts of love and gratitude and lovely southern charm and graces the South will save the world thanks for watching everybody have a pleasant weekend I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative Ford the
