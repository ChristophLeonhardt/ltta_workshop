1
00:00:00,342 --> 00:00:01,977
AND AN ATTORNEY SAID THE GOAL IS

2
00:00:01,977 --> 00:00:05,814
TO GET IT BEFORE A JUDGE SO

THE TREATMENT OF LGBT

00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:17,025
INDIVIDUALS.

STATES.

11
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:24,699
IS IT GOING BACK WARD UNDER

00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,201
A CONSERVATIVE ADMINISTRATION.

13
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:28,837
DOUG LOOKS AT THAT QUESTION

>> I AM A FOLLOWER OF JESUS

16
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,642
CHRIST AND THE BEEBL TEACHES

17
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:36,411
THAT MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN

THEY SUED AND THE CAKE SHOP

23
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,929
DECISION WILL BE DECIDED BY THE

00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:54,863
SUPREME COURT.

25
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:57,599
AT STAKE WHETHER

26
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:01,136

THAT THEY PLACE ON TO A PRODUCT.

32
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,915
BUT WHEN A BUSINESS IS OPEN,

33
00:01:13,915 --> 00:01:17,886
THEY REALLY SHOULD BE OPEN TO

34
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:19,220
ALL.

35
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,155

00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:27,462
EVOLVING.

39
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,765
THEY FOUND THAT OUT THE HARD WAY

40
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:34,469
WHEN IT RESTRICTED BATHROOM

41
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,869

42
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:40,008

00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,557
MODERATING THE BRIEF.

FAMILY, AND JUST MY LIFE IN

62
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:33,828
