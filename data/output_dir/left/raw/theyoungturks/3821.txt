1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,520
EARLIER THIS YEAR DONALD
TRUMP CLAIMED HE WOULD PULL OUT

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,780
OF THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,780
TRUMP'S IS A LITTLE BIT OF A

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,410
WILD CARD BECAUSE HE GOES BACK
AND FORTH ON ISSUES SEVERAL

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,670
TIMES, AND SO RECENTLY THERE WAS
A EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT WHO TOLD

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,710
REPORTERS THAT IT SEEMED AS
THOUGH TRUMP HAD SOFTENED ON HIS

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,710
STANCE IN REGARD TO THE PARIS
CLIMATE AGREEMENT, MEANING THAT

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,699
MAYBE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY
THAT THE U.S. WON'T PULL OUT OF

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,509
THAT AGREEMENT.

10
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:31,759
UNFORTUNATELY
GARY COHN, TRUMP'S ECONOMIC

11
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,840
ADVISOR, SPOKE OUT ON THIS ISSUE
AND HE SAYS NO, WE ARE

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,910
DEFINITELY PULLING OUT OF THE
PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT.

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,910
HE SAID

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:55,620
THAT --

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,730
EVERY COUNTRY GETS TO SET
THEIR OWN POLICY, IT'S NOT LIKE

16
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,369
THE EUROPEAN UNION POINTED AT
THE UNITED STATES AND SAYS YOU

17
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:14,790
HAVE TO DO THIS -- NO, EVERY
COUNTRY SETS ITS GOALS.

18
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,790
THERE IS

19
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:21,130
NO INTERNATIONAL COP THAT GETS
YOU IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW

20
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,139
THROUGH ON YOUR OWN GOALS.

21
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:28,280
THAT WAS THE CRITICISM AHEAD
OF TIME, NO ONE WILL HOLD YOUR

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,429
FEET TO THE FIRE IF YOU AS A
NATION DON'T MEET, AS ANA SAYS,

23
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:35,509
VOLUNTARY GOALS.

24
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:37,240
IT'S SO CRAZY.

25
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,539
EVERY TIME
DONALD TRUMP WAS TO RENEGE ON

26
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:43,799
SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT THE U.S.
HAS MADE WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES,

27
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,729
IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT, IT'S A BAD
DEAL.

28
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:47,969
BUT IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT

29
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:49,029
REALLY A DEAL.

30
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:53,310
AGAIN, IT'S A SET
OF GOALS EACH COUNTRY HAS

31
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,730
ADOPTED IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE
CHANGE.

32
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,730
HE JUST A BELIEVE IN

33
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,539
CLIMATE CHANGE, SO JUST BE
HONEST ABOUT THAT.

34
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:02,539
DON'T TALK

35
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,759
ABOUT A BAD DEAL, JUST BE HONEST
THAT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT

36
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,279
CLIMATE CHANGE.

37
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:12,290
THAT IS TRUE, BUT IF YOU TAKE
IT AS A DEAL, AND I AGREE, IT'S

38
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:19,680
NOT A DEAL, IT'S AN ACCORD --
EVEN REX TILLERSON, HEAD OF

39
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,350
EXXON MOBIL, SAID IT WAS A BAD
IDEA TO GET OUT OF THIS.

40
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,350
WHY?

41
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,640
BECAUSE ANY BUSINESSMAN, EXCEPT
THE MORON IN THE OVAL OFFICE,

42
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,340
KNOWS THAT IF YOU PULL OUT OF
THIS NO ONE WILL NEGOTIATE WITH

43
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,930
YOU LATER ON.

44
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,640
THERE ARE OTHER
DEALS THAT WILL FOLLOW THIS ON

45
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,700
CLIMATE SPECIFICALLY THAT IF YOU
PULL OUT OF THIS ONE NO ONE WILL

46
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,000
SIT DOWN AND MAKE A DEAL WITH
YOU.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,290
EVEN TILLERSON KNEW THAT,

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,090
THE FACE OF THE PETROLEUM
INDUSTRY.

49
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:59,000
IT'S ASTONISHING WHAT A BAD
BUSINESSMAN THIS IS.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,990
TILLERSON DID MENTION
GREENHOUSE GASES, AND YOU CAN'T

51
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,770
GET THESE PEOPLE TO MENTION
THOSE LOTS OF THE TIME.

52
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,960
THAT IS

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,290
THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT, WHICH IS
WARMING THE GLOBE.

54
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,760
I WAS

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,440
ENCOURAGED BY THAT.

56
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,840
AND THIS IS
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE TOUGH

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,120
TALK ON THE STUMP I WAS TALKING
ABOUT BEFORE NOW BEING THE THING

58
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,040
THAT DRIVES POLICY.

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,980
AND THAT IS
WHAT REALLY CONCERNS ME MOVING

60
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,980
FORWARD.

61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,530
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE
TOUGH TALK IS WHAT YOU NEEDED TO

62
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,530
GET INTO OFFICE, THEN THINGS
WOULD SOFTEN ONCE WE LOOK AT

63
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,280
THINGS AND REALLY EVALUATE WHAT
THINGS WE CAN BE TOUGH ON AND

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
WHAT WE SHOULDN'T BE.

65
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,600
LIKE THE
IRAN DEAL, THE PARIS ACCORDS --

66
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,490
THESE THINGS ARE FINE.

67
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,990
IT WAS
GREAT THAT YOU TALKED TOUGH ON

68
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,920
THE STUMP BUT NOW YOU ARE IN.

69
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,340
NOW LET'S EVALUATE THINGS BASED

70
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,490
ON FACTS.

71
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,220
TO HAVE HIS TOUGH TALK
DRIVE POLICY, LIKE THE WALL -- I

72
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,500
MEAN, I GET IT, EVERYONE GETS IN
A FERVOR OVER THE WALL BUT YOU

73
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,260
DIDN'T REALLY MEAN YOU WANT TO
BUILD AN EFFING WALL.

74
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,820
WHAT HIS TOUGH TALK, HIS
RHETORIC, IS DRIVING POLICY.

75
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,790
THIS IS HORRIFYING.

76
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,540
IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

77
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,650
IF YOU WERE
OUT ON THE TRAIL ALL THROUGH

78
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,740
2017, EVERY REPUBLICAN WOULD
OPEN THEIR SPEECHES SAYING THE

79
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,870
FIRST THING I WANT TO DO IN MY
FIRST 100 DAYS IS TEAR UP THIS I

80
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,870
RUN DEAL.

81
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,130
THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO
IS GET RID OF HEALTHCARE,

82
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,790
REPEAL AND REPLACE.

83
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,120
AS THE OPPOSITION PARTY, THAT
IS WHAT YOU DO TO ENGAGE IN

84
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
POLITICS.

85
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,940
TED CRUZ, IT WAS IN
HIS BLOOD TO DO WHAT HE SAID HE

86
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,940
WAS GOING TO DO.

87
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,760
THAT'S WHY HE
LOST, AND LOST PRETTY BADLY.

88
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,440
BUT

89
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,020
YOU KNEW HE KNEW IT.

90
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,350
YOU KNOW HE
UNDERSTOOD IT AND JUST DIDN'T

91
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,090
LIKE THIS PART OF GOVERNMENT.

92
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,490
WITH DONALD TRUMP, HE HAS NO

93
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,400
CLUE ABOUT IT, IT'S A VISCERAL
THING TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE TO GET

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
CHEERS.

95
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,700
IT'S A VISCERAL THING TO
APPEAL TO HIS BASE.

96
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,550
AND MEMBER,

97
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,389
TRUMP HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN
ANYTHING LEGISLATIVELY.

98
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,410
REPEALING AND REPLACING THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS AN

99
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,360
EMBARRASSING FAILURE, AND HE
SHOWED HOW INCREDIBLY

100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,040
INCOMPETENT HE WAS AS
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AS THE HEAD

101
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:37,010
OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

102
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,430
HE WAS
PRETTY MUCH M.I.A THROUGH ALL

103
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,740
THE DRAMA THAT OCCURRED IN THE
SENATE, AND HE FAILED.

104
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,740
IT'S EASY

105
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,650
TO THROW SOME RED MEAT TO HIS
BASE BY SAYING I GOT RID OF THE

106
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,980
PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT, I WILL
RENEGE ON THE IRAN DEAL, THESE

107
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,120
ARE ALL EASY THINGS FOR HIM TO
DO TO APPEAL TO THEM AND MAKE IT

108
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,310
SEEM LIKE HE'S ACCOMPLISHING
THINGS.

109
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,310
THE TRANSGENDER BAN IN

110
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,990
THE MILITARY, THAT'S ANOTHER
EXAMPLE.

111
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,430
HE TWEETED THAT OUT OF

112
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,760
NOWHERE WITHOUT ADVISING WITH A
SINGLE PERSON.

113
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
HE'S NOT THE

114
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,100
SMARTEST PERSON, HE'S NOT THE
BRIGHTEST PERSON, BUT THAT WAS

115
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,910
IN MY OPINION A STRATEGY.

116
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,910
THAT'S THE THING.

117
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,780
AT THE END
OF THE DAY HE'S GIVING THINGS --

118
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,530
AND THE ONES YOU JUST MENTIONED,
HE'S GIVING THINGS TO REPUBLICAN

119
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,150
NUMBERS OF CONGRESS TO TAKE BACK
TO THEIR DISTRICTS AND SAY I

120
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,140
VOTED FOR THIS, I VOTED FOR THIS
-- AND THESE ARE ALL

121
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:41,570
NONCONTROVERSIAL ISSUES AMONGST
THE DEEP REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE.

122
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,960
BUT AGAIN, THAT TWEET DROVE
POLICY.

123
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,570
FIRST THE MILITARY SAID

124
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,840
NOTHING, BUT ULTIMATELY THEY'VE
HAD TO CATCH UP WITH THAT

125
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,160
RHETORIC, WITH THE TRANSGENDER
BAN.

126
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,590
IT'S NOT AN ENDORSEMENT OF IT
OR THAT IT'S NOT FRIGHTENING

127
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,550
WHEN THESE HAPPEN, BUT IT'S
POLITICAL, IT'S FOR GAIN, AND

128
00:07:02,550 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S SAFE FOR A REPUBLICAN TO DO
THESE THINGS.
