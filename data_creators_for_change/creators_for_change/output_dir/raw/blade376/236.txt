00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
hi my name is Mars<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dyer and whether</font>

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,740
you're normally watching my videos or

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,589
hopefully someone new I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want a</font>

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment of your time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to reflect on some</font>

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,059
thoughts about something which affects

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,950
all of us and its government and

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,379
politics now whether you're young or

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,590
your old whether you're male or female

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,539
whether you're religious or not

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,220
religious wherever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the world</font>

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">in whatever situation I want you just to</font>

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,099
listen to this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want you to</font>

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,410
contribute your thoughts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want us</font>

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,680
together to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get something out there now</font>

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,940
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if this is something which</font>

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,219
occurs in other countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> but some think</font>

17
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,530
that has been in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mind for many many</font>

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,629
years not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mind but the minds of</font>

19
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,239
many others is the frustration the

20
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,750
government have this ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,820
allow the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go on and on</font>

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,980
without getting to the point so I guess

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the question straight away is why they</font>

24
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,289
politicians speak the truth but<font color="#CCCCCC"> first of</font>

25
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,230
all I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to express how I'm a very</font>

26
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">open minded and balanced person what I</font>

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,630
like to think in most cases so first I'm

28
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,060
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defend the government okay the</font>

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,400
way I work in life is through empathy I

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,049
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> empathize with people in</font>

31
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,420
situations and try and allow other

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,369
people to understand you know what it

33
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,670
must be like so right you're a manager

34
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,640
of a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the Sun is posted a</font>

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,490
complaint due to someone who is working

36
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,409
let's say on the shop floor in a

37
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,140
department store so they may get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit</font>

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">of hassle from the customer but at the</font>

39
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,520
end of the day if it was something big

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,250
that got in the press it would be the

41
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,079
manager who would take responsibility

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,090
for something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he hadn't directly</font>

43
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,860
done he may have people underneath him

44
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,479
who was supposed to sort the people out

45
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,909
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shop floor now if you times that</font>

46
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,460
by a hundred at least you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the</font>

47
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">prime minister so let's take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Prime</font>

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,040
Minister of Great Britain<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay he is</font>

49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,750
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a job of running the country</font>

50
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,659
I agree and he knows he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

51
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,790
at the same time can't people just get

52
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,590
it into their heads that he is a human

53
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,290
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you and I how the hell is one</font>

54
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,449
individual supposed to run a country oh

55
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,550
yes he has people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

56
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">advisers and that</font>

57
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,630
but whenever something happens in a

58
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,960
particular aspect of the country whether

59
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,900
someone gets stabbed or there is an MP

60
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,820
who has been scrutinized for fiddling

61
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,980
with finances I mean need to just

62
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,770
generalize points not specifics it will

63
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">always come back to him and blame has to</font>

64
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,670
be put on someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we'll put it at the</font>

65
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,980
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is the head of our country as</font>

66
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,630
much as i can understand people's

67
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,880
frustrations I'm sure you can understand

68
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that sometimes we just let</font>

69
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,980
anger overtake us and we like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put the</font>

70
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">blame so for the first point I just want</font>

71
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say that to some extent I understand</font>

72
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,880
and I empathize with how politics work

73
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,420
and how it must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a hard job to run a</font>

74
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,690
country however my second point is the

75
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,940
other end of the spectrum about how if

76
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,700
us the people are to empathize and

77
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,530
understand with the government what do

78
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">they need to do now as many of you may</font>

79
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,120
know I took part in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ass the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Prime</font>

80
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Minister campaign that was done on</font>

81
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,690
YouTube where I got to ask question I

82
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked about freedom of speech in that</font>

83
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,960
and the Prime Minister of Great Britain

84
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,540
Gordon Brown did reply miles you're

85
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,490
raising some very big points about our

86
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,500
civil liberties freedom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speech</font>

87
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,170
freedom of expression freedom of the

88
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,180
press in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our country freedom of assembly</font>

89
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,700
now these are all freedoms liberties

90
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,860
that I believe are the basis the

91
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,690
fundamental<font color="#CCCCCC"> heart of our Constitution</font>

92
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,000
now it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be questionable of did he</font>

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,460
answer my<font color="#E5E5E5"> question stripe but the same</font>

94
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,620
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be made was my question a</font>

95
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,120
good one and I'll let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decide that</font>

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll put the links in the</font>

97
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,180
description box but when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> watch news</font>

98
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,160
programs and you listen to interviews on

99
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the radio and politicians are talking</font>

100
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">about issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you get frustrated</font>

101
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">when they just don't get to the point</font>

102
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I can ever you know get the fall out</font>

103
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,860
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my head that someone is behind their</font>

104
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,440
back just before they go on and they say

105
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,930
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't say this you can say this and</font>

106
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,360
if they ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you about it try and circle</font>

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,430
around the issues I just feel that there

108
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">is this need in politics to you know</font>

109
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,720
humanize government to make them speak

110
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,820
straight with us government always come

111
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,200
along and go you want better health

112
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,630
service you want immigration<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw it out</font>

113
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,479
as examples but they say is if they've

114
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:24,840
just come along out of

115
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,040
we're and we're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> from scratch</font>

116
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,949
and it just comes up again<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again but</font>

117
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:30,570
why can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just say this is what</font>

118
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,949
we're sorting out these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issues</font>

119
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:34,440
at the moment if they're struggling they

120
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,960
can say so maybe I'm just being naive

121
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,520
and ignorant and they can't actually say

122
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to another point</font>

123
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">about party politics have you ever</font>

124
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,000
watched the house of lords<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the House</font>

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,979
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Commons when they're debating stuff</font>

126
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,720
these are people who try to manage our

127
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,419
country who do such childish stuff you

128
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,040
know they laugh at each other make jokes

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,710
make snide little comments and they

130
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,570
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the point you know they</font>

131
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,910
will all do stuff so they get<font color="#CCCCCC"> elected</font>

132
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,370
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary but at the same time</font>

133
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,919
there should be this honesty Boris

134
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,080
Johnson who was elected recently as

135
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,090
mayor<font color="#CCCCCC"> of london whether you like him or</font>

136
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,710
not something he said in<font color="#CCCCCC"> his opening</font>

137
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,229
speech was he was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be willing to</font>

138
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,479
allow Ken Livingstone the previous mayor

139
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,900
of london to work by his side and he was

140
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,550
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we live in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a time now where</font>

141
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,740
it shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be about you know separate</font>

142
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,449
parties<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean of course that needs to</font>

143
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,340
be competition but it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

144
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,470
bringing ideas discussing them and

145
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,090
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best ones to help the</font>

146
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,789
community and people running our country

147
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:34,800
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the maturity dudes you know</font>

148
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,810
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

149
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">might just completely blind to the fact</font>

150
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,349
that they can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> because if they were to</font>

151
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:43,050
be honest and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say oh you know the you</font>

152
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,370
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the National Health Service</font>

153
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,830
isn't running well then they'd be kicked

154
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,349
out but then you know that's where I

155
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,639
come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my first point about</font>

156
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,280

<font color="#E5E5E5">great deal of honesty from the Prime</font>

189
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,430
account and do a response channel as

190
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,530
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a video up or just post</font>

straightforward answer and dialogue

198
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,789
running with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the leaders</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the members</font>

199
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">of parliament of our country and the</font>

200
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:27,070
politicians of others maybe I just lost

201
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,680
the plot but this is just something that

202
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,360
is brought up in the media over and over

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,280
again and I just think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font>

204
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of wake up and we need to grow up</font>

205
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say you know surely we</font>

206
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,990
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the maturity to be honest between</font>

207
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,699
those running the<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries and the</font>

208
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:45,909
people that are you know a part of it so

209
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:48,370
post up video responses comments just

210
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">spread this everywhere and hopefully we</font>

211
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,990
can see where this goes it just

212
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,870
frustrates me and hopefully I'm not the

213
00:07:55,870 --> 00:00:00,000
only one thank you
