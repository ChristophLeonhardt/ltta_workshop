this and not walk around with like a big

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,119

a vlogging camera earlier this week

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,980

75
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,569
was guitar strings cuz forever ago I

76
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:54,720
broke a string on this guitar it's been

77
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,400
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> three weeks without me replacing it</font>

78
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,849
also I don't change my strings ever so

79
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:01,980
these have been on for like probably a

80
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,959
year or two so it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change some</font>

81
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,660
strings and I'm missing there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

82
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,239
plug and it keeps the string in there

83
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,780
and to keep it safe I put it the one

84
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,570
place I knew it would not get lost there

85
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,780
