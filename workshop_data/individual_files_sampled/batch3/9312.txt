" THEY WERE AMONG THE VICTORS." Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO "TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT" ." IT IS THIS WEEK, THE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE BEGINNING OF THE ROBERT MUELLER RUSH INVESTIGATION AT THE END OF THAT PERIOD WE HAVE DISCOVERED THERE IS STILL NO EVIDENCE AT ALL OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN OF 2016 AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT BUT MUELLER'S MANY SUPPORTERS IN WASHINGTON DON'T SEEM TO CARE ABOUT THAT. THAT'S BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATION WAS NEVER ABOUT RUSSIA, OBVIOUSLY. THE WHOLE ABSURD FEVER DREAM WAS ALWAYS A WAY FOR THE RULING CLASS TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT LOSING POWER IN 2016. IT WAS A WAY FOR THEM TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT WHY TRUMP GOT ELECTED. THEY NEVER HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. ALONG THE WAY THE INVESTIGATIONS PROVIDED DEMOCRATS WITH A FULL YEAR OF GOVERNMENT-FUNDED IPO RESEARCH AND DESTROYED THE LIVES OF A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP. THERE HAVE BEEN DOWNSIDES FOR DEMOCRATS. VOTERS ARE NOT IMPRESSED BY THE RUSSIA STORY. IT IS WEIRD AND FALSE AND CONFUSING AND IT'S PRECISELY NOTHING TO DO WITH VOTERS ACTUAL LIVES OF THE ISSUES THEY VOTE ON. IT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME FOR EVERYONE. AND YET IT'S ALL DEMOCRATS HAVE. TRUMP IS EVIL, SO IS RUSSIA. THAT'S THE ENTIRE PROGRESSIVE PROGRAM 2018 SUMMARIZED INTO SENTENCES. IF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAD A ATTITUDES. NO WONDER THEIR APPROVAL NUMBERS ARE FALLING. REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN HAS INTRODUCED OVER THE RESOLUTION CALLING FOR AN END TO MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION OR A REPORT WITHIN 30 DAYS. HE JOINS ALONG WITH RON DeSANTIS OF FLORIDA. HE SAYS HE MAY KNOW THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON WHO WAS SPIED ON TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN FOR THE FBI IN 2016. GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO YOU BOTH TONIGHT. CONGRESSMAN, FIRST TO YOU. THIS RESOLUTION WOULD CALL FOR AN END TO THE INVESTIGATION OR A REPORT SUMMARIZING ITS FINDINGS SO FAR. AM I MISSTATING THAT? BOTH CORRECT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT'S BEEN A YEAR. AS YOU SAY, IT'S BEEN $20 MILLION AND WE NEED TO SEE A REPORT ON WHAT EVIDENCE HE HAS AND ABSENT THAT EVIDENCE IT SHOULD WIND UP WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE RESOLUTION PASSING. Tucker: SO WHY WOULDN'T OTHER MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES IN THE CONGRESS WANT SOME OVERSIGHT AND? IF YOU ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY BOUND TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE DOJ, WHY ARE YOU THE ONLY PERSON CALLING FOR THIS? ARE NOT. MATT GATES IS ALSO CALLING FOR IT. THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER CALLING PORTS. CALL YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND GET THEM ON BOARD. YOU CAN ONLY HAVE A FREE REPUBLIC, AS YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE TRANSPARENCY AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED. IT IS A WITCH HUNT. IT HAS GONE BEYOND AN INVESTIGATION AND THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION WE FOUND, THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF CRIMINALITY HAS BEEN ON THE DEMOCRATS. WE ARE CALLING ON MUELLER TO SHOW HIS HAND OR FOLD THE DECK. Tucker: EVEN IF I BELIEVED THE PRESIDENT COLLUDED WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN I'D BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THE PARAMETERS AREN'T CLEAR. THE TIMELINE IS OPAQUE AND IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE POINT IS. CONGRESSMAN, ONE OF THE ENDURING MYSTERIES OF THE PAST TWO WEEKS HAS BEEN THE STORY OF A MOLE OR SPY WITHIN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FEEDING INFORMATION TO THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. HAVE YOU ANY SENSE WHO THAT PERSON MIGHT BE? I DO, TUCKER, BUT I THINK THAT THE ISSUE NEEDS TO GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE SO MY PROPER CHANNELS. I'M NOT COMFORTABLE DISCLOSING WHO I THINK IT IS BASED ON THE EVIDENCE THAT I HAVE, BUT I CAN SAY THIS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE AN ANSWER. UP OR DOWN, DID THE FBI DIRECT SOMEBODY TO SPY ON DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN? WAS SOMEBODY ACTIVELY WORKING TO UNDERMINE HIS CAMPAIGN AND CREATE THE ILLUSION OF COLLUSION? AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, I THINK THAT'S MORE SERIOUS THAN THE FISA ABUSE. I THINK IT'S MORE SERIOUS THAN ROSENSTEIN BUTCHERING THIS WHOLE APPOINTING ORDER WITH MUELLER FROM THE BEGINNING. WE NEED THE ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS. THEY ARE NOT GIVING US THE ANSWERS RIGHT NOW. Tucker: THEY ARE DEFINITELY NOT. I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO RISK LIBEL BY NAMING SOMEONE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT BEEN PROVED IN COURT, BUT GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. ARE YOU SAYING SOMEONE WHO WORKED ON THE DRUM CAMPAIGN FED INFORMATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT? SO IF YOU LOOK AT GLEN SIMPSON'S TESTIMONY FROM FUSION GPS, HE TALKED ABOUT THERE BEING A HUMAN SOURCE AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS CONTROVERSIAL. SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS PAPADOPOULOS. IT'S NOT PAPADOPOULOS. THE ISSUE IS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THERE'S A HUMAN SOURCE. PETER STRZOK, HE OPENS UP THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION IN 2016, WHAT DOES HE DO THE NEXT DAY? HE GOES TO GREAT BRITAIN AND HE GOES TO LONDON AND HE'S MEETING WITH PEOPLE. HOW THE HECK WOULD YOU DO THAT IF YOU JUST OPEN THE INVESTIGATION THAT DAY? I THINK IN THAT KIND OF, THE LONDON, CHRISTOPHER STEELE, GLENN SIMPSON ACCESS IS PROBABLY THE INDIVIDUAL WE ARE LOOKING AT. WE NEED TO KNOW WHETHER THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS SPYING OR NOT. I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT IT BUT I BELIEVE WE CAN GET THOSE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WHEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PONIES UP THE DOCUMENTS. Tucker: ARE YOU SUGGESTING OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SOMEONE WHO WAS PRESSURED INTO COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATION, OR SOMEONE WHO FREELY SEND INFORMATION OVER ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN? I THINK IT'S THE LATTER, TUCKER. I THINK THIS COULD BE SOMEONE, POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE BEEN PAID BY THE FBI, LIKE STEELE. THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT TO PAY STEELE. DID THEY PAY ANYBODY? YES OR NO. DID THEY DIRECT ANYBODY TO GO TO THE CAMPAIGN? YES OR NO. VERY EASY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER. Tucker: I'M SORRY, CONGRESSMAN. PLEASE GO AHEAD. RON IS EXACTLY RIGHT. WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUELLER AND COMEY. COMEY KICKED THIS WHOLE THING OFF WITH A BOGUS FISA WARRANT AND WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUELLER AND COMEY? DID MUELLER GIVE COMEY IMMUNITY? DOES COMEY THINK HE'S ABOUT THE LAW? WHERE ARE WE GOING WITH ALL OF THIS? THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED. Tucker: DO BELIEVE, QUICKLY, CONGRESSMAN, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT JIM COMEY HAS BEEN OFFERED IMMUNITY BY THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION? I THINK IT STANDS TO REASON AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW.
