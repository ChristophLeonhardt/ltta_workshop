1
00:00:00,716 --> 00:00:03,218
TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL

2
00:00:03,218 --> 00:00:04,419
UNDER FIRE TONIGHT.

3
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:05,087
>> Mike: PRIMETIME ED HENRY

4
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:05,887
LEADING US OFF THE NIGHT GREAT

5
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:07,889
TO SEE YOU.

6
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:10,759
DEMOCRATS ARE BACK IN THE FBI AS

7
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,194
THEY PUSH BACK ON THE IDEA THAT

8
00:00:12,194 --> 00:00:14,029
THERE WAS NO RUSSIA COLLUSION.

9
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:15,430
LISTEN TO THIS.

10
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,164
>> THE EVIDENCE I'VE SEEN, THERE

11
00:00:16,164 --> 00:00:17,933
WERE VERY GOOD REASONS TO BE

12
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:19,167
CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONTACTS THE

13
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:20,902
TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAD.

14
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:21,670
YOU NOT TO BE A LAWYER AND DON'T

15
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,740
HAVE TO BE AT THE ACCESS I HAVE.

16
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,507
>> EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN IT

17
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:27,042
WOULD'VE BEEN NEGLIGENT FOR THE

18
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:29,311
FBI NOT TO TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT

19
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:30,045
THE COUNTRY IN THE MIDST OF

20
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:32,347
INFORMATION IT WAS RECEIVING.

21
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:33,548
>> Mike: FOR VIEWPOINTS FROM

22
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:35,150
INSIDE THE G.O.P. SIDE OF THE

23
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,418
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WE

24
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:38,220
ARE JOINED NOW BY REPUBLICAN

25
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,421
CONGRESSMAN CHRIS STEWART FROM

26
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:39,921
UTAH.

27
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:41,023
CONGRESSMAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU

28
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:41,356
TONIGHT.

29
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:43,592
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

30
00:00:43,592 --> 00:00:45,127
>> Mike: YOUR REACTION TO

31
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:45,861
LATEST ATTACKS ON THE COMMITTEE

32
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:46,228
THERE?

33
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:47,796
>> I GUESS I WOULD SAY TWO

34
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:48,196
THINGS.

35
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:50,399
NUMBER ONE IS IF YOU HAVE

36
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,166
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION FOR HEAVEN

37
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,801
SAKES, SHOW IT TO US BECAUSE YOU

38
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,403
MUST BE THE SMARTEST MAN IN THE

39
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:55,170
WORLD BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE DOES.

40
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,838
PLEASE SHARE IT WITH US.

41
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:58,440
IN THE SECOND THING IS, ONCE

42
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,109
AGAIN WE HAVE THIS THING ABOUT

43
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,244
THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO

44
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:02,878
DESTROY THE DEPARTMENT OF

45
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:03,211
JUSTICE.

46
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:05,013
THEY ARE TRYING TO WEAKEN OR

47
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:05,513
DESTROY THE FBI.

48
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:07,849
WE ARE TRYING TO DO QUITE THE

49
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:08,216
OPPOSITE.

50
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:09,518
WHAT COUNTRY WOULD WE LIVE IN IF

51
00:01:09,518 --> 00:01:12,220
WE ALLOWED LAW ENFORCEMENT

52
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:12,954
UNFETTERED POWER AND SAID GO DO

53
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:15,524
WHATEVER YOU WANT AND DON'T TELL

54
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:16,758
US AND HIDE IT FROM US AND WE

55
00:01:16,758 --> 00:01:18,060
ARE NEVER GOING TO ASK YOU AND

56
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,760
WE ARE NEVER GOING TO PROVIDE

57
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,595
ANY OVERSIGHT.

58
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:21,763
I THINK IT'S NOT A PROPOSITION

59
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:24,232
TO THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

60
00:01:24,232 --> 00:01:25,067
WE WANT TRANSPARENCY.

61
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,102
WE WANT THEM TO BE ACCOUNTABLE

62
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:27,669
JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER

63
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:29,604
ORGANIZATION IS.

64
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:30,172
WHY IN THE WORLD WITH

65
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:32,240
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE

66
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,442
ACCOUNTABLE EXCEPT FOR THE FBI.

67
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:35,043
I THINK MOST AMERICANS WOULD

68
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:35,644
FIND IT OFFENSIVE.

69
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:37,079
>> Mike: YOU IN A REPUBLICAN

70
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,513
COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE ARE

71
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:41,450
ALSO UNDER ATTACK FROM ADAM

72
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:41,783
SCHIFF.

73
00:01:41,783 --> 00:01:43,885
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

74
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:44,686
>> THE PRESIDENTS RESPOND AND

75
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:46,054
CHAIRMAN NUNES, JORDAN AND

76
00:01:46,054 --> 00:01:48,023
GALLEON OTHERS IS BRING IT ON.

77
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:49,257
WE DON'T CARE.

78
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:49,991
WHATEVER IS IN THE SERVICE OF

79
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:51,860
THE PRESIDENT WE ARE WILLING TO

80
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,228
DO.

81
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:54,262
THIS IS A DRAMATIC AND NEW AND

82
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:55,497
DESTRUCTIVE LOW I THINK FOR THE

83
00:01:55,497 --> 00:01:57,632
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES A

84
00:01:57,632 --> 00:01:59,101
SICKLY TO IGNORE THE WARNINGS OF

85
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:02,737
THE FBI AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

86
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:03,638
LIVES.

87
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:05,407
>> Mike: YOUR RESPONSE?

88
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:06,041
>> IT'S JUST SILLY.

89
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,443
IT'S DAILY FOR HIM AND FRANKLY

90
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:09,610
IT'S ONLY FOUR OF THE DEPARTMENT

91
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,612
OF JUSTICE AND THE FBI.

92
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:11,880
IT LETS REVIEW THIS.

93
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,348
REPUBLICAN MEMO THAT CAME OUT

94
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:14,349
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WHEN WE WERE

95
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:15,851
TOLD AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS WILL

96
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,219
JEOPARDIZE AMERICAN LIVES, IT

97
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:18,386
WILL JEOPARDIZE NATIONAL

98
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:20,122
SECURITY AND THEY HAVE NOT EVEN

99
00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:20,655
SEEN IT.

100
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:21,656
THEY WERE MAKING THAT CLAIM THEY

101
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:22,757
HAD NOT SEEN OUR MEMO.

102
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:25,060
WE RELEASE THE MEMO.

103
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,061
I WOULD CHALLENGE ANYONE TO SHOW

104
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:26,628
ME ANYTHING IN THERE.

105
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:30,832
WHAT IT DID WAS IT EMBARRASSED

106
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:32,100
THE FBI AND THE LEADERSHIP.

107
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,435
THEY'RE MAKING THE SAME CLAIM

108
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:33,702
NOW.

109
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:35,437
LAST WEEK WE HEARD YOU WERE

110
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:36,204
GOING TO DANGER AMERICAN LIVES

111
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:37,873
AND NATIONAL SECURITY BUT THEN

112
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:40,609
THEY LEAKED IT, OR SOMEONE DID.

113
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:41,977
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE

114
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:43,111
COMMITTEE DIDN'T BECAUSE THEY

115
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:44,246
HAVEN'T SHOWN IT TO THE

116
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:45,013
COMMITTEE.

117
00:02:45,013 --> 00:02:45,747
THEY WILL SHOW IT AND SHARE IT

118
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:48,150
WITH THE PRESS AND WITH THEIR

119
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,850
FAVORITE REPORTERS, BUT THEY

120
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,619
WON'T SHARE IT WITH THE

121
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:51,653
CONGRESS.

122
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:52,988
AND FOR HIM TO SAY THE

123
00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:54,856
REPUBLICANS WANT TO ENDANGER

124
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:57,459
NATIONAL SECURITY IS SILLINESS.

125
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,761
WE ARE THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

126
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:00,195
INTELLIGENCE.

127
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:00,862
WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST

128
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:02,998
SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN THE

129
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:04,032
U.S. GOVERNMENT.

130
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:04,933
WE PROTECT THAT INFORMATION OR

131
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:05,834
AT LEAST THE REPUBLICANS HAVE

132
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:06,468
TRIED.

133
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:08,036
BUT TOO OFTEN WE SEE LEAKS.

134
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:09,604
BUT I PROMISE YOU IT'S NOT FROM

135
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:11,339
OUR SIDE, THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR.

136
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:13,241
>> Mike: OTHER PROMINENT

137
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:14,743
DEMOCRATS ARE TAKING ISSUE WITH

138
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:18,647
THE PRESIDENT SUMMONING TOP DOJ,

139
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:19,414
FBI OFFICIALS TO THE

140
00:03:19,414 --> 00:03:19,814
WHITE HOUSE.

141
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:23,084
HERE'S CHUCK SCHUMER.

142
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:27,222
>> THE PRESIDENTS BEHAVIOR IS

143
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:28,356
THE KIND OF GROSSLY AUTOCRATIC

144
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:31,560
BEHAVIOR WE WOULD EXPECT IN A

145
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,130
BANANA REPUBLIC, NOT A MATURE

146
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,664
DEMOCRACY.

147
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:36,464
>> Mike: WAS IT APPROPRIATE

148
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:41,403
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH

149
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:42,470
THEM TODAY?

150
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,471
>> OF COURSE IT WAS.

151
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:44,873
THEY ARE PART OF THE EXECUTIVE.

152
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:45,907
HE IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE.

153
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:48,043
THEY WORK FOR HIM.

154
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:49,044
AND HE'S JUST SIMPLY SAYING WHY

155
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:51,279
ARE YOU SHARING THIS WITH THE

156
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:52,247
AMERICAN PEOPLE?

157
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:53,415
AND TO MR. SCHUMER'S POINT.

158
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:56,351
HERE'S MY DEFINITION OF A BANANA

159
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:56,851
REPUBLIC.

160
00:03:56,851 --> 00:03:58,620
WHEN YOU HAVE ANY AGENCY UP BUT

161
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,055
PARTICULARLY A MILITARY OR

162
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:00,789
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT IS

163
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:01,590
ABOVE THE PEOPLE AND REFUSES TO

164
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,226
ANSWER TO THE PEOPLE.

165
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,027
THAT IS A BANANA REPUBLIC.

166
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:07,429
THERE IS THE OPPOSITE OF A

167
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,896
BANANA REPUBLIC.

168
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:09,864
A GOVERNMENT THAT ANSWERS TO THE

169
00:04:09,864 --> 00:04:11,633
PEOPLE WHEN THE CONGRESS REQUEST

170
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:13,034
INFORMATION, THEY PROVIDE THAT

171
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:13,835
INFORMATION, THEY DON'T

172
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:15,470
STONEWALL, THEY DON'T HIDE, THEY

173
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,238
DON'T LIE, THEY DON'T DECEIVE.

174
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:18,906
THAT'S THE TYPE OF GOVERNMENT WE

175
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:20,274
ARE HOPING TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE

176
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:20,575
HERE.

177
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:22,142
>> Mike: THERE SO MANY PROBES

178
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:23,445
GOING ON RELATED TO VARIOUS

179
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:23,778
ISSUES.

180
00:04:23,778 --> 00:04:25,513
WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS IN TERMS

181
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:26,248
OF WHAT THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE

182
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:28,250
COMMITTEE IS DOING RIGHT NOW?

183
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,218
>> THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO

184
00:04:30,218 --> 00:04:31,419
US, THIS LAST PIECE.

185
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:33,088
FOUND OUT THAT HILLARY CLINTON

186
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:33,788
PAID FOR THE DOSSIER.

187
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:34,889
FOUND OUT SEVERAL THINGS ALONG

188
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:36,258
THE WAY BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

189
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:38,627
PIECE TO US AND WE WANT THIS

190
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:39,394
INFORMATION AND FOR THEM TO SAY

191
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:41,896
WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE IT IS

192
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:42,797
UNACCEPTABLE.

193
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,233
WE HAD TO THREATEN IMPEACHMENT

194
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,668
EVEN MORE CONTEMPT AND I THINK

195
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:47,969
THOSE TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE TO US

196
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:49,037
AND WE SHOULD USE THEM.

197
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:50,071
WHAT WE CAN'T DO IS JUST SAY

198
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:52,207
THEY MADE IT HARD, I GUESS WE

199
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:54,175
WILL JUST QUIT, I GUESS WE WILL

200
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:54,609
JUST GIVE UP.

201
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:56,511
WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

202
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:59,648
TO TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

203
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,249
>> Mike: DO YOU WORRY,

204
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:02,450
BRIEFLY, DO YOU WEAR THAT IN

205
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,451
THEM OUT OF THE PER FINDINGS IN

206
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:04,286
ANY OF THESE PROBES THAT A

207
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:06,454
CERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE

208
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:07,455
POPULATION WON'T BUY WITH THE

209
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,823
CONCLUSIONS ARE?

210
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:09,624
>> NO DOUBT.

211
00:05:09,624 --> 00:05:10,458
IT DOES WORRY ME.

212
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,493
WE LIVE IN VERY DIVISIVE TIMES,

213
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:13,895
NO QUESTION.

214
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:15,230
SOME PEOPLE SAY THE SUN RISES IN

215
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,631
THE EAST AND THEY SAY NOT IN MY

216
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:18,033
WORLD IT DOESN'T.

217
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,034
EVEN IF THAT'S TRUE YOU STILL

218
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:19,768
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL

219
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,269
THE TRUTH.

220
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:22,304
WE STILL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY

221
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:23,471
TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND

222
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:24,205
IF THAT'S IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE

223
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:26,708
ARE NOT IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE I

224
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,475
CAN'T AFFECT THAT BUT WHAT I CAN

225
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:29,010
EFFECT IS TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO

226
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,711
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPEN, WE ARE

227
00:05:29,711 --> 00:00:00,000
GOING TO SHARE IT WITH YOU AND
