1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,819
the job that everybody has done is
incredible and I know you're also in the

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,880
process but to think of the incredible
power of that storm and while people

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,400
unfortunately passed it was such a small
number that no

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,740
we saw thousands and thousands of people
may have their lives as it as a number

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,270
is a very small number which is a great
community of folks go in the back that I

6
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,470
know in the case of Bhima in the case of
Coast Guard the job you've done in

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:36,050
saving people in saving lives as an
example in Harvey in Texas we talked

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,420
over 16,000 live and nobody would even
understand that to talk to even imagine

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,670
and down here the same thing so I want
to thank everybody you guys I mean I

10
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,600
don't want to see you next week in
another place okay we've seen you enough

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,809
but I just want to thank everybody the
first responders on behalf of myself our

12
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:01,670

13
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,050

seen the devastation we're going to see

14
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,480

have to say that you've got there

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,820
whereas our government here Rick Scott

16
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:27,730
the job he's done is incredible and I
guess I've been very lucky because you

17
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,740
know you have a great governor in Texas

00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,480

problem that were working hard of that

56
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,479
