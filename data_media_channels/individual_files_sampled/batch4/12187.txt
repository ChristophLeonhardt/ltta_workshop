so in the last few years you've been saying a lot of things that are honest because you're really honest guy or an emotionally open guy and an honest guy and that's ticked off a lot of people on your own side how is that been number one and number two what's the response of people on the left bin to the quote-unquote new Glenn Beck the kind of attempts to reach across the aisle and have discussions because I can imagine that while you are opening a or you're putting out an open hand I can't imagine that in every case certainly not publicly there are people who are actually taking it Oh publicly no the worst the most shameful on the last left I think is glad I went to go see the president of GLAAD and her crew she came into my office in New York City and and I called for the meeting and I said I just said leave here arms at home and can we just come and talk and I started the meeting I said look everyone everyone on my side will hate me for this will hate me for this I don't agree with anything that you guys do okay I think you're a very militant group however right now in Russia they are abusing homosexuals abducting them killing them taking their driver's license away this is at the time what five years ago it was getting really ugly in Iran they're throwing homosexuals off the rooftops of buildings people need to be brave and people need to say look then in our case it's not that wide but I need I need Penn Jillette to be able to stand next to the Pope and have both of them say look there's a lot of huge things we disagree with but there's a couple of principles that we do and and for GLAAD and Glenn back to stand next to each other and saying killing homosexuals is wrong we've just taken a big chip off the table of both sides okay we've lowered the temperature and we can talk
