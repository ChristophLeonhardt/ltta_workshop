hi I'm Max Keiser welcome to the Kaiser reporters you get that oh yeah look at that oh boy so much to cover and yeah just a few minutes to cover it so let's get into it Stacy thanks you know we have an innovation economy don't we yeah and in fact we're so innovative here that we actually have innovations in poverty you know we're inventing new ways to be poor why America is the world's first poor rich country or how American collapse is made of a new kind of poverty consider the following statistics the average American can't scrape together 500 dollars for an emergency 1/3 of Americans can't afford food shelter and health care health care for a family now cost 28,000 about half of the median wage which is $60,000 and by themselves of course statistics a little but together these facts speak volumes the story they are beginning to tell is this America it seems as becoming something like the world's first poor rich country I read that it's very interesting they get into this it's innovation in poverty it's and they mix for elements later on in that article including what he called a certain puritanical pure radicalism that prevents people from escaping a mindset of deterministic pursuit of goals outside of a more community minded spirit that is also contributing to this new neo poverty invention of the American zeitgeist did that make sense hi just checking yes yes it's been confirmed that made sense just to put into context this guy is a professor at I believe it's Harvard his name is Amir Hague he also lives in the US and London Europe you know so like us he's had the experience of that there is another alternative to how you run certain services and basic necessities of life how you provide those to the population whether it's most important being health care shelter education things like that so he's coming from actual experience of you know you can have a healthcare system that is not so violent and gruesome and abusive to the members of that healthcare system you can have it you don't need to have this outrageously expensive crazy system it's not necessary there's a way like Germany to educate your population at a low cost to all and yet achieve great results and huge manufacturing capacity but yes the puritanical kind of background that you you must there's a certain sort of Germanic Puritanism of like you wanting to like abuse yourself for no reason and yet it's caused great distress American exceptionalism is a concept that doesn't really apply to America it's not exceptional in very many ways not in any important ways not in the ways that you would look toward in a society that is healthy there's only one country in the world that deserves that kind of Exceptionalist moniker in that of course is France the French exceptionalism is well justified it's a jewel amongst countries getting hungry just thinking about on the shells Alizee or the nice thing no asset and a quad baby well this guy is a philosopher as well so he puts it as such he says America appears to be pioneering a new kind of poverty altogether one for which we do not yet have a name it is something like living at the knife's edge constantly being on the brink of ruin one small step away from catastrophe and disaster ever at the risk of falling through the cracks it has two components massive inflation for the basics of life coupled with crushing asymmetrical risk so the asymmetrical risk is in particular how he points out that risk basically has been taken off the balance sheets of all the corporations and you see that reflected in the S&P stock prices and the banks stock prices and values is they don't take any risk at all there there's a huge amount of socialism in America for corporations for the corporate elite whether it's in the energy sector or the banking sector or the housing sector there's a huge that's how the housing sector the largest private land board in in the United States is Blackstone Group so this is a huge private equity group and they own the biggest section of the they bought up on the cheap all the properties handed out by basically Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for it for them to take over during that during and after the financial crisis all right they also have a majority of the ETF market the exchange-traded fund market which is just a raunchy a system of putting Blackrock in a position to scrape money away from pension funds and in another land grab money grabbing way it's not completely unnecessary again he talked about it's not necessarily on paper absolute poverty because the America has on paper one of the highest income levels in the world is something like the fourth or fifth highest after several small European countries but the average American has a relatively high income that of a person in a nominally rich country only his income does not go very far most of it is eaten up by attempting to afford the basics of life we've already seen how steep healthcare costs are but then there is education there is transport this interest in rent there is media and communications there's child care and elderly care all of these things reduce the average American to constantly living right at the edge of roon one paycheck away from pew nary one emergency away from losing it all like even just the childcare thing for example you talk about France I have a girlfriend of France who had a child she didn't have to work for like three years after and the state provided basically all sorts of access to child care from a few months old she could take it to the crash take the child to the crash and go look for work or go to have time on her own my sister who had to return to work soon after having a child basically the childcare costs were more than her income what's that that seems like insane well often you hear that meant that well sure in Europe they have the greater lifestyle and but reason being they don't have to spend any money on their military because the US military Protectorate but how stupid are Americans to pay for Europeans defense at the expense of having quality of life so most Americans quality of life compared to most Europeans is horrible and they're subsidizing European quality of life so if you're living in France you're living awesomely great compared to typical American life and thanks to the American taxpayer so you know the puritanical ISM it gets in the way because the puritanical will say that while we are down with God you know our belief in God gives us the strength to subsidize the European lifestyle Europeans have a great lifestyle but we've got God you know so is that a really a fair exchange I would posit No well everybody has their own different you know views on religion and what they want and maybe you know monks live in and you know hair shirts and they they live totally basic lives and whatever but I want to talk about this article because he says that you know the basics of life the costs are soaring in the United States but incomes have collapsed at the same time so you have health care didn't used to cost half of a median income even a decade ago after all but now it does so what happens when in a decade or two health care costs all of the median income how can an economy let alone a society function that way so in a way I'm kind of curious like our the in North Carolina Obama care costs went up 44% and then another like 30% last year their projected to go up another 10 or 20 percent next year so in a way I'm kind of fascinated by this gruesome experiments it's it's kind of you know like really gruesome experiments of the past and history that we've seen is like how how gruesome will this get like how awful like what will we do to ourselves did walk to quizar as they would say in France look that up and you'll be appalled but you mentioned Medicare as well and this is the health care system in France is kind of like the Medicare system here and Medicare you still have insurance the government basically provides the insurance however and sets rates for things like MRIs and x-rays and things like that so you have to be you pretty much have to be 65 to get onto Medicare some long-term disabled they're also put onto medicare quite early but the headline this week from the US government remember this is a body of people pointed by Trump and the Republicans but Medicare to go broke three years earlier than expected trustees say in 2017 Medicare covered fifty eight point four million people 85% of them seniors at a cost of seven hundred and ten point two billion dollars the report also showed that Medicare's total cost will grow from three point seven percent of GDP in 2017 to five point eight percent by 2030 eight so the year it's going to go bankrupt max yes it's 2026 just when you qualify for this state-run efficient more efficient french-like healthcare insurance policy that's right that time I thought that I had escaped the devil you know I've been trying to stay one step ahead of the devil my whole life the American collapsed everyone born after me unfortunately is look gonna be horribly you know treated by the progressively surveillance state and gulag casino that the phrase that I use is go like casino this gentleman said that there's no new name for this rich new American poverty that's being invented I coined the phrase I call it the casino gulag yes right so they're gonna take my Medicare away from me just and I'm so all the money I paid into it all these years is gonna go up in smoke it went to the military it went to Donald Rumsfeld what do the 20 trillion dollars that the Pentagon lost under the rug somewhere they can't find it and so that's partly my money that they are using now to you know buy chateaus on switzerland and have a great lifestyle in europe not in the frickin butthole America and finally Trump orders immediate steps to boost coal nuclear power plants as a matter of national and economic security so President Donald Trump last week directed energy secretary Rick Perry to take immediate steps to bolster struggling coal-fired a nuclear power plants to keep them open calling it a matter of national and economic security so we just said the basics of life and one of them of course you need energy you need heating or air conditioning or the lights on in your house and now because it costs more to provide electricity through coal or nuclear power than wind or solar or gas well now he's gonna force us to take his buddy's coal provision well this is a great example of how capitalism should and should not be played right so in capitalism there's winners and losers now in this version of capitalism the winners are the legacy coal industry that are going to keep their jobs despite the fact that there are solar energy that would create millions of new jobs and transform America into a legacy away from fossil fuels but those are the losers so the innovators or losers the new people who are gonna get jobs or losers the people who are now student debt or losers the legacy coal guys are the winners the legacy oil guys are the winners the legacy old central bankers are the winners innovation youth dynamism the Constitution the Bill of Rights these are the losers in this America in this version of America I'm waiting for the collapse I look forward to the end of America I give it 36 months and then we'll see something new and that's the way it works thank God stay tuned for the second half a lot more going welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to go to Toronto I speak with Christiane saucier of equiped Christian welcome with the Kaiser report max it's an honor to be here all righty Christian equip it is described on your website as quote securities on the blockchain what does that mean it's a hot topic if you watch the news these days it's all over the place except people call them security tokens and we figured we'd I mean that that's a great idea let's make it you know in into a real blockchain so equipment is a proof-of-work blockchain using the sha-3 hash that i know you're familiar with and and essentially it's a it's a open-source crypto securities protocol that allows anyone to issue or trade securities on the blockchain right so tokens put all kinds of stuff on the blockchain and a lot of people question you know is that really necessary to do that so in the case of blockchain useful in your case in terms of disintermediating depositories and transfer agents so there's two major companies in this space is a duopoly equi bit is now set to disrupt this multi hundred billion dollar business correct that is correct I mean we are going to your building and we've actually launched a test net on June 1st a peer-to-peer crypto securities protocol so it is something that anyone can come and use and thereby disintermediating as you just suggested some of the centralized players that capture fees today on on every single little transactions we do and to the extent where some of those services can now be encoded and to appear to be a protocol that's what that's what we're doing with equipment right the transfer agency business I know from my years working on Wall Street how that works basically it's a back-office function where pieces of paper you know securities and shares are moved around the system and this is very expensive way to do things and it's right to be disintermediated or disrupted by block chain because blockchain would completely eliminate all the need for those inter mediation of intermediary steps and so there you up there in Toronto and so you've got the test net that you've launched and so how's the test up and going fantastic you know we probably should have launched it before now that we have some of our minor community working with us with the test net I mean they're they're they're troubleshooting and creating more no tools and containers and versions of the software and then we would be able to do with with just a quick bit group you know employees so it's been it's been very very successful we're very excited about it and it's only a few days in and already it's demonstrated so much very cool so now what about stock exchanges you know they are the ones who are the dealers dealing in securities and they deal with these transfer agents and all these other back-office functions so would this be a product that you would go to an exchange with like Toronto Stock Exchange for example would you go to them and say hey we can take off your hands all this paperwork and put it on the blockchain you get all kinds of cost savings and time savings is that the market for this there you go I mean it is an open source protocol so it's a technology that we haven't released a code yet because we're still you know make sure making sure that the quality is all there but when the code goes out yeah this is a this is a a network protocol that can be used by anybody it could be a group of course the commercial entity will be going in and approaching under commercial organizations to to help them understand and adopt the network and some of them well some of them won't we believe that those that will will put themselves in a significantly better competitive position so yes these existing marketplaces out there they they also have to deal with all the transfer agents and depositories and and so so to the extent where a a peer-to-peer protocol can help reduce the transaction costs to these exchanges definitely there will be some very very interesting developments in the future regarding that right so typically in the token space is it's called people come to market with tokens and there's no equity in those tokens but what you're talking about is that you're creating blockchain to allow people who are actually offering equity so these are companies that want to offer equity they're gonna do an initial public offering like we used to do back in the day before the the initial coin offerings you know equity offerings and so they would go to an exchange and then the solution however is a blockchain so this in this case the blockchain is putting into the ledger all of that information that's then publicly available and it's transparent and there's huge cost savings so let's say I'm taking a company public I'm doing an IPO can you kind of walk us through a little bit about you know where equi bit kind of fits in there absolutely and just to situate maybe the audience you know echo business is a fork of Bitcoin so everything you know about Bitcoin probably applies to equipment and and we're building equity capabilities now on top of that code base so with that said if someone is interested in issuing you know a shares for a project or debt I mean it's any security instrument there's various options when you come to the equities blockchain first of all you're gonna have to have a credits which is a crypto currency of the blockchain in in other block trains against the parlons that's used there is utility token right it's a token that has a utility in that it provides access to the services that are provided by the network so the equipment cryptocurrency is is is that for the equipment network and once you have these equi bits you can go to the peer-to-peer network and issue a security so you can say I promise X Y Z right or this is one out of one shares of XYZ companies and you can define what your issuance is that is by the way at that moment the regulated activity right that governments want to know about and all that it's that issuance that that is regulated so so when you come into the equity network and you issue that is where you want to make sure that you've got you know your your you understand the regulations of your of your locale of where you're located but beyond that the network itself provides then you know the interface to document the issuance store the security on to a blockchain on the peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin that cannot be you know falsified or easily you know attacked and all the activities that follow you need to you know to know who buys your securities you need to communicate with your shareholders you need to capture votes so there's a lot of activities that are provided by the financial service industries beyond just you know storing the securities on paper today these these capabilities are implemented in a peer-to-peer fashion using peer-to-peer communication protocols on the acrobat network so once you've issued your security there is a Marketplace on the network obviously where others can come in and and purchase or trade into these securities the Eldar know your customer and then time money laundering and all these things are facilitated with a passport system that we have which is essentially a web of trust where if I'm about to issue securities you have an accreditation organization that can vet you know various investors and because of where I issue my security is from I need to comply potentially with these regulations so I will only I will mark my securities of the blockchain so that they can only be purchased by people who have been vetted by organizations you know like yourself maybe or whoever does the accreditation so the issuer can choose who has the ability to accredit a prehensile solution to a very antiquated system and so you guys are really riding the wave into this future of crypto currencies now let's talk about the token itself you mentioned it is sha-3 unlike sha-2 it's Shawn 3 which is the latest generation other than Mac's coin there are very few coins that actually use sha 3 why did you decide to go with sha 3 and what are the unique difficulties at the moment in mining sha 3 coins like over there at equi bit and max coin yeah the choose of a had a choice of the hash was was a big decision for us we have a we have a few blog articles I believe about it that go into details for people interested in summary sha 3 was essentially the best hash we could find and this was not our opinion we you know we looked at a competition that was done by the NIST National Institute of Science and Technology I believe and and and when they did their competition for coming up essentially with a successor for shot 256 everybody knows that at some point in the future we don't know when but computing power will be such that sha-256 will no longer be a secure hash you know for for for for what we're using it for today they're safe I don't want anybody worrying about sha-256 right now it's still a very good hash all crypto runs on it we love it but sha-3 is better and and for various reasons that were put to the test during that nist competition and sha-3 came out as the leader - for example which is a hash used by aetherium was one of the competitors to catch AK which is the team that won - a free competition so so so aetherium also has a pretty good hash but we believe sha 3 is the best out there there are no known I believe a six that I'm aware of at least at this time so we have a very very healthy community of GPU miners which we love it goes with the spirit of decentralization we're working on mining pools - were working with various various other organizations that that profit that will provide protocols and technologies to help ensure that our network stays decentralized right so sha-3 is quantum computer resistant I believe is the phrase used in the industry you guys use it for the reasons you just outlined a max Cohen used it because Nigel spark smart who designed the max can we put her in there at inception he was really way ahead of his time so what is yeah once the launch date tell us about that when do you go to the main net we don't have an exact date for main net yet we want to ensure quality on the test that obviously before we release the the main blockchain and when we say we release I mean it's essentially releasing our Genesis block which includes some of the equal bets that we've been using to finance our operations so the main net launch will will happen once we have validated the security and the quality of the test net along with the community and at that moment we'll be able to release the Genesis block and start mining on the real blockchain we suspect this should be in the next coming months so so as a matter of weeks and months not enough years but but it's it's in the near future for sure perfect Christian sauce a thanks so much ring on the Kaiser report pleasure to be here alright well that's gonna do it for this edition of the cosna report with me max geyser and Stacy Herbert want to thank our guest Christian saucier equi bit up there in Toronto if you'd like to get in touch with us it's Kaiser report on Twitter until next time bye y'all
