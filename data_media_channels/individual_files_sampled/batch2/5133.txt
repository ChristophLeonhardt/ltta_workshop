this morning President Trump claimed without any evidence at all that he well the estimated death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria was being inflated by his political enemies catch this in order to undermine him Trump wrote quote 3,000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico when I left the island after the storm had hit they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths a long time later they started to report really large numbers like 3,000 this was made by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising billions of dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico that's Trump talking and tweeting rather in fact that figure was the result that figure of almost 3,000 dead was a result of an independent study it was commissioned by Puerto Rican officials an estimated nearly 3,000 excess deaths stemming from the Aragon other words people that would normally not have died in a statement today Puerto Rico's governor said the victims and the people of Puerto Rico do not deserve to have their pain questioned in response to the president's tweet Trump's former co-author Tony Schwartz wrote when Trump tells a lie as with the handling of the disasters Porto Rico hurricane the magnitude and repetition of the lie is in direct proportion to how fully he believes he is guilty of the charge being made against him for more I'm joined by Tony Schwartz co-author of the art of the deal and CEO of the energy project also joining us is good for us for Susan page Washington bureau chief for USA Today Tony explained this this disproportional response the lie is big enough to cover the embarrassment well I think what happens to Trump is not so much the embarrassment but what lies beneath the embarrassment which is the absolute of Allergy and that's a mild word - any evidence that he is weak or he is wrong or that he has failed that's intolerable to him it becomes a hundred percent preoccupying and he must attack it and as we know from the thousands of lies he tells and has told that's the way he does it put him under sodium pentathol put him in a lie detector make him tell the truth does he know the truth this is the issue raised by Bob Woodward one he says he can't he doesn't have the capacity to tell the truth and the other is he doesn't have an attachment to reality so which is it as you've observed him as a co-author does he know how to lie or does he simply lie because he doesn't know the truth Chris he lives on two tracks one when he is in a slightly saner state and it's all relative in his case he is absolutely capable of consciously and intentionally lying for a particular outcome when he is aroused when he's feeling under attack it happens instinctively impulsively and with no forethought he just does what he has to do it's a survival mechanism show up in a blob snape with sodium pentathol truths here put him into its veins will he say 3,000 people were not killed in Puerto Rico during Maria will he say that again under the influence of medicine of medical influence yes why because he actually now does believe well he knows you know he knows I don't think he's that unboard from reality I do think in moments of feeling under attack he loses sight of it the prefrontal cortex literally shuts down and fight-or-flight that happens to him but I think when the physiology comes back down yeah he knows he knows 6,000 lives put them under put him under oath for that and they were under sodium pentathol and he will say that anyway Trump's tweet this morning was his latest defense of his administration's response to Hurricane Maria earlier this week he called it quote an incredible unsung success his former homeland security adviser Tom Bossard told the New York Times the missing part was empathy I wish he'd paused and expressed that instead of just focusing on the response success retired general Russel Honore who managed the military response to Hurricane Katrina back in 2500 W had this advice for a president Trump today if I was his boss or standing next to him as his chief of staff I would kick him on the ankle and said look focus on the future day I'm storm stop looking in the rearview mirror well you know this is what presidents this is where the divide you know I think I'll be J without and handed out water one time when he had a hurricane downer at bad weather down in that Louisiana there'll be a flue over you know you only get one shot at this and Trump is not looking good you know that natural disasters are trouble for politicians because they people expect the public officials to be there if there's a hurricane or if there's a riot and published through the punish we're not showing empathy for not showing up when people are in trouble and also have a question for you from your previous conversation which is worse is it worse that President Trump believes what he's saying opposite all the evidence that we have about how many people died in border we go or is it worse if he asserts that and knows it's not true well let me get back to Tony cuz you work with her hand in glove let me ask you the one I know I only have a few things that I serve I think Joe Scarborough says I know on these bones there's a couple things I do stick to okay like voter suppression drives me crazy stupid words like a right drive me crazy cuz I lived through Vietnam I think all that I was around during that these I hate stupidity by politicians when it comes to war because so many people die for their country but they die and they shouldn't and when they deny people voting they denying America's very quality of who we are this question he said Barack Obama I know he has an African name Barack Hussein Obama beware to the Senate of the presidency but why did he keep saying he was born in her in Kenya when it was impossible to figure out why a white woman from Kansas would go over to Canada to Kenya to have the baby there so that she could 35 years later have him actively available for the presidency under the Constitution it didn't make any logical sense to claim that he was an illegal immigrant basically and yet he kept doing it and doing until he feel he reached the point of diminishing returns and stopped saying it just one Friday said oh that's not true do you tell me he believed that all those months he was spewing that crap no he was lying he was lying he did it because it served his intention or is his hope of running for president at the time and that's why he does it I mean that's consistently why he doesn't just want to go back Chris to this issue of empathy because one of the problems here is that Donald Trump doesn't have empathy and that's not a modest statement he literally has no empathy he does not feel emotions like care and and it's a sociopath well as I've said since 2016 in The New Yorker when he started to run for president yes he is a sociopath there is no question he's a sociopath meaning he neither as a conscience nor does he have a heart or I should say because it's more accurate it's so deeply buried that even he doesn't have access to it because what he feels is to have any of those feelings compassion empathy used to make him weak and vulnerable and as I said earlier that's what's intolerable to him you know make sure you make it sound like Blade Runner when they they go to the replica and they say what do you feel when you see the bug die and they've been there but a replicant knows you've found the man he doesn't feel anything anyone doesn't feel anything that is that isn't that terrifying it isn't that so repugnant in a moment like this the 3,000 people who died and their families suffering grieving in part because he did such a terrible job of of taking care of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of that storm in this case I believe he has no upside okay I don't think it he doesn't well it's gonna serve him well and don't think it's gonna be ignored but if he doesn't do it well wow it's one more it's one more take the many electoral votes this Puerto Rico have yeah exactly and how many white people compared to brown or black people well the Washington Post fact checker gave Trump's claim this morning four Pinocchios it's the highest rating for a false or misleading statement a lie in other words prior to the tweet the fact checker report the Trump had already pissed 5,000 false claims since becoming president you know I watched like you do and most political reporters and generally sign reporters we look at the approval rating the president and it really says as guardrails it's like mid-30s around 5:00 mid-40s somewhere in that ring it just bounces around there cyclically or seasonally but these lies don't hurt or many why not well you know I think his supporters are with him because they're with him because they like his bluster they're like his attitude they they like what he says about trade and and about America being cheated and about standing up for a more traditional America but I do think there's some corrosive effect and I think you see some of it now is approval rating now down to maybe 40 or so a little ratchet effect there then go much like the bottom that hasn't fallen out of it but I do think there are some kind you know I think that even though he's been set on truce before if you look at this one it seems especially painful because it's about the deaths of Americans it is it seems like it's a it's worse than than the lie about things we've had phrases similar to this but this hurricane denier might be as new and it's at the moment is another hurricanes about to hit him I know is so it's a strange denial thank you I think you've got to figure it out hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
