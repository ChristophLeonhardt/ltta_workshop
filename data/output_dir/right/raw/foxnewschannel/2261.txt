EVERYBODY HERE IN SAN DIEGO

00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:02,558
TRYING TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT

4
00:00:02,558 --> 00:00:04,059
WILL HAPPEN NEXT.

5
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,563

DEFYING OUR BORDER SHOWS HOW

00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:16,472
WEAK CAN EFFECTIVE USE

12
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:19,007

WE NEED LAWMAKERS WILL PUT

AMERICA FIRST.

17
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:28,350
ELMA."

18
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,184
THE PRESIDENT GOING AFTER JON

00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,553
TESTER FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS

20
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:32,755
INCLUDING THE RONNIE JACKSON

21
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:33,355
SITUATION.

22
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:34,490
HERE WITH JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER

23
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,359
CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT

24
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:37,960
COMMITTEE AND FRANCISCO

25
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,962
HERNANDEZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY.

26
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:41,597
ONE OF THE THINGS THE LAYOUT

27
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:44,299
HERE IS THESE ARE PEOPLE SEEKING

28
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:44,633
ASYLUM.

29
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:46,368
THERE IS A PROCESS TO SEEK

30
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:46,702
ASYLUM.

31
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:47,836
THEY HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE UNTIL

32
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:49,772
THEY CAN GO THROUGH THAT

33
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:50,372
PROCESS.

34
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:50,806
RIGHT, JASON?

35
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:51,373
>> YES.

36
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:53,976
THEY CAN CLAIM ASYLUM AND GO TO

37
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:54,676
UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN THE

38
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:55,177
COUNTRY OF OREGON.

39
00:00:55,177 --> 00:00:57,179
THERE IS THIS PRINCIPLE WHERE

40
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:59,982
THEY JUST DO NOT GET THE CARAVAN

41
00:00:59,982 --> 00:01:00,983
COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND STATE TO

42
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:02,417
STATE AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY

43
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:02,818
WANT TO GO.

44
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:04,253
WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO ESCAPE

45
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:06,221
THE OPPRESSION, YOU NEED TO STOP

46
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:08,457
WHERE YOU ARE FREE OF THAT

47
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:09,024
OPPRESSION.

48
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:11,160
>> Martha: FRANCISCO, WHAT DO

49
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,760
YOU SAY ABOUT THAT?

50
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,362
THEY CAME MOSTLY FROM HONDURAS.

51
00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:14,263
ONCE THEY GOT INTO MEXICO, THEY

52
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:17,533
WERE FREE OF THE OPPRESSION THEY

53
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:19,168
WEAR UNDER ACCORDING TO THEM IN

54
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:19,835
THEIR SITUATION, THE

55
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:21,937
APPLICATION, IN HONDURAS AND

56
00:01:21,937 --> 00:01:22,337
GUATEMALA?

57
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:24,640
>> ACTUALLY, NO.

58
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,008
MEXICO DOES NOT HAVE A POLITICAL

59
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:27,176
ASYLUM PROCESS LIKE WE DO.

60
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:28,477
WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS

61
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:29,978
THESE FOLKS ARE TRYING TO APPLY

62
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:31,380
TO COME HERE ILLEGALLY.

63
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,848
THE PROBLEM WITH APPLYING AT THE

64
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:33,615
EMBASSY IN HONDURAS IS IF THEY

65
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,684
ARE TURNED AWAY, WE ARE TURNING

66
00:01:35,684 --> 00:01:36,351
THEM AWAY TO THE VERY SAME

67
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:38,153
PEOPLE THAT ARE PROSECUTING

68
00:01:38,153 --> 00:01:39,855
THEM, WHO ARE GOING TO KILL

69
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:42,157
THEM, NARCO TRAFFICKER, CARTELS.

70
00:01:42,157 --> 00:01:42,858
THE PROBLEM IS THAT NEITHER

71
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:45,127
COUNTRY CAN ADMIT THAT HONDURAS

72
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:45,828
CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF

73
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:47,596
ITS CITIZENS.

74
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:55,871
WE HAVE TO LET EVERYONE IN.

75
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:58,974
>> WE HAVE A MILLION PEOPLE WHO

76
00:01:58,974 --> 00:01:59,875
LEGALLY AND LAWFULLY COME TO

77
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:00,976
THIS COUNTRY AND WE ARE FAILING

78
00:02:00,976 --> 00:02:01,710
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO

79
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,345
IT LEGALLY.

80
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:05,347
THEY JUST WANT TO GO THROUGH THE

81
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:05,781
DOOR.

82
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:07,583
>> NO, BUT THERE IS NO PROCESS

83
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,817
WHERE THESE FOLKS CAN APPLY TO

84
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:09,518
COME HERE OTHER THAN KNOCK ON

85
00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:11,386
THE DOOR.

86
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:13,188
LOOK, THEY CAN TRY TO PAY A

87
00:02:13,188 --> 00:02:14,223
SMUGGLER TO CROSS THEM WITH A

88
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:16,358
TUNNEL OR A TALL LADDER, BUT THE

89
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:17,492
PROBLEM IS THEY ARE TRYING TO

90
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:19,761
APPLY TO COME HERE LEGALLY.

91
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:20,963
>> Martha: YEAH, BUT

92
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:22,197
FRANCISCO, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

93
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:22,631
TALKING ABOUT.

94
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:25,367
THERE IS A PROCESS.

95
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,369
THERE ARE 150 AND 60 OF THEM.

96
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:28,737
THEY ARE ALREADY PROCESSING SOME

97
00:02:28,737 --> 00:02:29,538
300 PEOPLE, AS YOU JUST HEARD IN

98
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:31,173
THE REPORT.

99
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:32,341
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, YOU

100
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:33,041
HAVE TO WAIT YOUR TURN.

101
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,009
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE

102
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:36,178
APPLICATION PROCESS.

103
00:02:36,178 --> 00:02:36,945
>> CORRECT.

104
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:38,080
>> Martha: WHATEVER PERCENTAGE

105
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,549
OF THEM MAY ACTUALLY BE GRANTED

106
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:41,717
ASYLUM BASED ON THEIR SITUATION.

107
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:42,851
WE KNOW THEY ARE BEING ADVISED

108
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:47,222
IN TERMS OF HOW TO WORK THAT

109
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:47,556
SYSTEM.

110
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:50,392
BUT THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS.

111
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:51,393
>> THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING.

112
00:02:51,393 --> 00:02:53,528
THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

113
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:55,397
HAVE PROOF OF THE PERSECUTION.

114
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:56,365
ABOUT 75% OF ALL HONDURAN

115
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:58,166
APPLICATIONS ARE DENIED ANYWAY.

116
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,368
THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE

117
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:00,369
GOING TO DO WITH THEM.

118
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:01,370
BUT YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE

119
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,170
FACT THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO

120
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,772
APPLY TO COME HERE LEGALLY.

121
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:06,441
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE ASYLUM

122
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:06,942
LAWS, CHANGE THEM.

123
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:09,344
I AGREE.

124
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:10,512
>> Martha: JASON, MY QUESTION

125
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:11,046
WHY ARE THEY DENIED?

126
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:14,750
>> AGAIN, HE MAKES A POINT.

127
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,918
>> NEED TO CHANGE THE LAW.

128
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:20,322
>> THE LAW IS WORKING.

129
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:21,023
THESE WANT TO BREAK THE LAW.

130
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:22,791
THEY CAN GO TO THE UNITED STATES

131
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,926
AND BUSY IN HONDURAS.

132
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:26,762
>> YOU CANNOT APPLY IN THE

133
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:27,396
UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN

134
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:27,763
HONDURAS!

135
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:29,731
THEY WILL NOT LET THEM APPLY!

136
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,366
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN

137
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:31,733
THE DOOR.

138
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:32,668
HERE, THEY ARE KNOCKING ON THE

139
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:34,569
DOOR TO APPLY HERE LEGALLY.

140
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:35,938
CAN Y'ALL NOT GET THE POINT?

141
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:36,571
YOU WANT TO OBEY THE

142
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,408
OBEY THE LAW, YOU DO NOT LIKE

143
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:43,145
THE OLD LAW OF POLITICAL ASYLUM!

144
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:43,779
>> Martha: SOUND LIKE THEY

145
00:03:43,779 --> 00:00:00,000
WILL HAVE TO WAIT THEIR TURN AND
