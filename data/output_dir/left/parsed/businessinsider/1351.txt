just immediately felt heavy braking on
the runway and claimed fishtailed a
little bit and just for a few seconds
you could feel this bouncing off and
with mud splattered up on the windows we
figured we were off the runway but thank
God everybody was fine you know my son's
a Marine Corps aviator and Michael
always tells us every every landing you
walk away from is a good one I just
spoke to our future vice president and
he's okay do you know he was in a big
accident with a plane and he's fine but
out everybody's fine everybody's fine
you
