independent conservative journalists faith Goldie was assaulted at the American border by an Tifa having been assaulted at work by a left-wing man because I'm a conservative female journalist trying to do my job I obviously have a lot of opinions about this my former rebel colleague faith Goldie was attacked by an Tifa at the Quebec border with the United States it happened at Roxon Road now that area has become well-known as a point of entry for migrants fleeing possible deportations in the United States and they make their illegal entry into Canada they're an anti-illegal immigration protest was scheduled to happen there and then the violent left-wing group and Tifa also showed up to clash with anti-illegal immigration groups now riot police were there as well as journalists and camera crews from every mainstream media outlet in Canada and so was faith she was live streaming Paris coping with her cell phone just about every interaction and everything that she could see happening around her that day and it's lucky that she did because she captured her own assault on video now I want you to pay attention to faiths demeanor what she was doing and what she was saying when she was violently attacked this is from her periscope that she recorded that day here so they're ready to push me into traffic right now completely circling us in we're gonna head out of here because this is insane obviously the cops don't want things escalate I'm not gonna so faith was backing away saying that she was leaving she was was within a few feet of riot police and yet an tyfa falt so emboldened and righteous in attacking her and her male friend that they did attack them and and Aoife did it right in front of video cameras and journalists from every mainstream media outlet in the entire country let me show you another angle of what happened to faith and her male companion remember this is right in front of the riot police and the media here ace and her male friend were kicked they were shoved they were spat upon faiths friend was shoved to the ground her phone was taken from her and she was kicked and the mainstream media captured all of this on video weird right because you probably didn't hear about any of this on the 6 o'clock news I'm going to show you what the mainstream media tweeted about what happened to faith now look at this video from Angela Mackenzie of CTV News who's clearly just a few feet away from what happened to faith and her male friend here makenzy describes what happens to faith is being pushed out by counter-protesters not assaulted by an Tifa and Mackenzie's video conveniently cuts out before the violence happens to faith despite the video coming nowhere near Twitter's video limit isn't that convenient that she missed the most important part of the story happening right in front of her this is why trust in the media is at an all-time low and I know CTV saw all of exactly what happened to faith all of it how do I know they didn't miss a second of any of it look at this still grab from faiths periscope livestream what a poignant shot not because it's beautiful but because it's disgusting and because this shot shows the true allegiances of the media in this country the media is there standing shoulder to shoulder with an Tifa the media is pointing their cameras at faith because well you know they know who the real bad guy is it's the 120 pound woman with the ideas they don't like and not the 180 pound man with a mask spitting on her and the goons who are with him kicking her and threatening her and assaulting her chivalry is dead at least in the mainstream media the journalists stood there and watched her get assaulted because for them capturing the video of this woman they don't like faith Goldie getting a beatdown was more important than human decency and helping her the mainstream media captured those visuals and then they buried the visuals and the story because they hate faith more than they hate the violent dirt bags of auntie fuh and they hate face more than they want to tell you the truth all of those reporters standing there were faced with a conundrum tell the truth or run PR for an tyfa guess what they chose let me be the first to say faith has said some controversial things things that I wouldn't say things that I don't often agree with but that's it she just says controversial things that's all she's ever done she just says things she doesn't actually do anything to anyone and we don't solve political disagreements with violence in this country in fact that's the whole point of a civilized society that we get to say and think whatever we want without the threat of violence either from this state or the people around us and for the media hitting people you don't agree with doesn't seem to be all that big of a deal for them actually they think it's even a little bit funny this is a tweet from Jonathan Montpetit he is a CBC journalist and he was there when faith was assaulted at the protest and this is what he tweeted out after a woman an independent journalist was assaulted by violent left-wing thugs he said border demo all done highlight for me seeing faith Goldie gets scolded by the Quebec police force for using her cell phone while driving there's absolutely no way that Mon petit didn't know that faith was assaulted at that protest and his first reflex was to mock her and that tweet was liked by CBC star rosemary Barton and dozens of other blue check mark and other mainstream media journalists many of whom proudly championed the issue of the Free Press and feminism unless of course it's a conservative woman trying to do the job the mainstream media are just unwilling to do I know what happens next for faith at least in her treatment from the mainstream media because I lived it and it happened to me already next comes the publication of conspiracy theories about how maybe it didn't happen to her or that maybe she had done something to instigate it or that maybe an Tifa was acting in self-defense against faith because that's the treatment got from the mainstream media and the mainstream left in Canada after I was punched at the women's March in Edmonton by a male feminist named Dion views I was accused of provoking the punch I was accused of not listening the first time I was accused of making it up even though you can clearly see what happened to me on the video I took with my camera that day and that's why I sued Dion views after I was shut out of being able to give a victim impact statement at the criminal proceedings against him I sued him in part to show the media and the perpetrators and the left-wing alike that I like faith don't deserve the violence and the threats against us secondarily I did it to prove that we don't deserve the justifications and the truth or isms for the violence against us passed off as mainstream media news because in the end that attack on our credibility becomes a second victimization from a crowd of people so concerned about the victimization of women with mean tweets and manspreading and the mainstream media is collaborating with an Tifa and the violent left wingers when they hide the violence being committed against the right and especially right wing female journalists by the left I testified in court at my civil trial against the unveils that I thought the threats of violence would get worse if something wasn't done to take this violence against us more seriously and if left wing female journalists were being routinely assaulted at work women's groups journalists organizations and the government would be standing up for them and calling for an end to the threats and to the violence but for me and faith and other conservative journalists who are assaulted in the course of our jobs we can't even get conservative politicians to take the principled stance that we deserve to be safe at work - and that silence from everyone left and right makes my job everyday more dangerous for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read what you just saw there is my daily video that I do here at the rebel but did you know that I have my own weekly
