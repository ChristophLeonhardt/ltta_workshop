empathize UK lecture hall one of the big

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,720
issues I brought up was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that of</font>

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,170
selfishness and selflessness because the

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,730
conclusion I've come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the past</font>

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,219
five years of doing what I do on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font>

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">I realized that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so easy to box</font>

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,420
people into one or two categories one of

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,789
to enter the spectrum<font color="#E5E5E5"> of integrity</font>

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,580
however they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something as an act of</font>

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,189
self-interest or they do it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

12
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,289
complete selflessness<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the point that</font>

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,780
I've always believed and try to express

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,520
is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can be both so for</font>

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,770
UNICEF<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason the model works in my</font>

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,050
opinion is because it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> people from</font>

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,180
all walks of life to do what they

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,039
normally do and without needing to

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,739
compromise themselves and have a good

23
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,440
time whilst helping people around the

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,000
world that<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have the necessities of</font>

help so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could be a chef a video</font>

27
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,000
blogger musician and artist all these

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,619
sort of things it doesn't matter what

29
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">your passions are you can do it in the</font>

30
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,610
context charity and make a huge

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,790
difference so when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing</font>

32
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,920
charitable things when celebrities are

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,290
doing them when anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> does something</font>

34
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is charitable it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to</font>

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,400
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumptions on what their what</font>

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,250
their reasoning behind it is either

37
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,750
they're doing it because it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

38
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,270
feel better perhaps they're doing it

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,390
because they'll get exposure from doing

40
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,759
something charitable all these sort of

41
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,100
notions and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps they are just</font>

42
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">being completely selfless I don't agree</font>

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,659
with any of these positions really I

44
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,750
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with them in exclusive forms</font>

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,140
because sure if you do sound charitable

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,420
if you help other people you feel good

47
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,759
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there is nothing wrong with</font>

48
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,710
that at all and if you can do something

49
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you normally enjoy and you get pleasure</font>

50
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,300
out of it whilst helping other people

51
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,730
surely<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a great thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

52
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,470
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this video really</font>

53
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,840
it's just a short one is to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,260
there there is no one or the other every

55
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,180
action in life I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think can have both and</font>

56
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,360
so what I ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is to just think</font>

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,910
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you enjoy doing in life and</font>

58
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,130
if you think oh it's all about your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

59
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,590
self-interest think about well how can I

60
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,990
also make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it an act of selflessness as</font>

61
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,970
well how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do what I normally do</font>

62
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,900
whilst helping other people and if you

63
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,100
are ever doing selfless acts think about

64
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,780
how can you get some enjoyment out of it

65
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,000
I assume though with most selfless

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,250
actually do get something positive from

67
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,950
it no I if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't get something</font>

68
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,410
positive from it we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really be</font>

69
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,980
motivated to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so yeah I just</font>

70
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,720
find it interesting or I've been someone

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,220
who's been challenged again and again

72
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,750
over the past five years on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube for</font>

73
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">my integrity why am i doing it am i</font>

74
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,370
doing just decade to make myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

75
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,560
better or just to get popular all this

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,610
these sort of things and for me it's

77
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,290
it's not an issue you know because

78
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,100
either way I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep doing it</font>

79
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,780
either way whatever you do it like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

80
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,820
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep doing but if it's a choice</font>

81
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,700
between doing what you enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and helping</font>

82
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,769
other people surely that should be

83
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:32,030
celebrated and promoted as opposed to

84
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,070
enjoying yourself by punching someone in

85
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,790
the face you know I mean as long as you

86
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,080
do what you do and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a negative</font>

87
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,230
impact on other people's lives and for

88
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,080
me that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> real ethos of how I like</font>

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,670
to live my life you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that treat</font>

90
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,930
others<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you'd like to be treated</font>

91
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,660
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that sense you may go oh so</font>

92
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,860
you're saying you should only treat

93
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,750
people because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

94
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,450
you'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> treated you know and</font>

95
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,830
then that's a rhetoric that's used in

96
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,860
many different religions and that's

97
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,769
exactly my point it's not selfish it's

98
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,700
not selfless it can be both<font color="#E5E5E5"> um what</font>

99
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">words we give that I'm sure you can come</font>

100
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,830
up with some suggestions of your own and

101
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's all I had to say today so thank</font>

102
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,000
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I look forward to hearing your</font>

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:00:00,000
thoughts<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so next time</font>
