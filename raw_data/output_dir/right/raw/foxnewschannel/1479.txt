1
00:00:01,576 --> 00:00:03,111
TRULY SAD MOMENT IN HISTORY.

2
00:00:03,111 --> 00:00:04,713
JOHN ROBERTS.

3
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:05,881
THANK YOU.

4
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,282
>> Bill: BACK TO ALAN

5
00:00:07,282 --> 00:00:07,682
DERSHOWITZ.

6
00:00:07,682 --> 00:00:09,518
THE WORLD OF CABLE NEWS AND YOU

7
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:10,786
ARE WELCOME TO COMMENT.

8
00:00:10,786 --> 00:00:12,888
THIS IS WHAT WE DO.

9
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:13,722
WHEN JOHN ROBERTS JUST SAID

10
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,724
THIS IS THE ART OF THE DEAL YOU

11
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,359
SAT THEIR SHAKING YOUR HEAD.

12
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,326
>> ABSOLUTELY.

13
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:20,228
THIS IS PLAYING INTO DONALD

14
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:20,796
TRUMP'S STRONG SUITE.

15
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:22,531
HE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A DEAL.

16
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:24,299
HE KNOWS HOW TO WALK AWAY FROM

17
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:25,200
THE TABLE AND OFFER TO COME

18
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,768
BACK TO THE TABLE.

19
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:28,136
I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO

20
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:30,205
SECOND GUESS OUR PRESIDENT WHEN

21
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:31,373
IT COMES TO NEGOTIATING WITH

22
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:31,773
NORTH KOREA.

23
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:34,109
I DON'T THINK HE HAD ANY CHOICE.

24
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:35,610
ONCE HE HEARD WHAT -- I THINK

25
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,482
ONCE HE HEARD WHAT THE  LEADER

26
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:41,750
OF NORTH KOREA WHAT HE SAID

27
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,084
ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENT AND

28
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:43,552
OUR COUNTRY.

29
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:45,887
HE WALKED AWAY IN A CONDITIONAL

30
00:00:45,887 --> 00:00:46,188
SENSE.

31
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:47,989
HE SAID I WELCOME YOU TO COME

32
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,192
BACK BUT ON MY TERMS.

33
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:52,060
REMEMBER, WE HAVE MOST OF THE

34
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,128
CARDS IN THIS NEGOTIATION.

35
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:54,529
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS

36
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:56,164
PLAYING THEM WELL.

37
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:58,567
>> Bill: THE KEY LINE HERE,

38
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:02,838
SADLY BASED ON THE ANGER AND

39
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:04,739
HOSTILITY IN YOUR MOST RECENT

40
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,340
STATEMENT I FEEL IT'S

41
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,441
INAPPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME TO

42
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,676
HAVE THIS LONG-PLANNED MEETING.

43
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:08,710
WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE

44
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,579
PRESIDENT IN THE LAST WEEK HE

45
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,280
HAS CHARACTERIZED THIS AS A

46
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,682
VICTORY FOR NORTH KOREA AND

47
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:14,616
CHARACTERIZED IT AS A VICTORY

48
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,485
FOR THE WORLD AND THE WAY HE IS

49
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:18,019
TRYING TO SELL THIS TO KIM.

50
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,155
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

51
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:21,890
HEARING FROM OUR LEADERS.

52
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,327
BUT THERE IS A LOT THEY DON'T

53
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:25,627
LIKE.

54
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,162
IN THAT SENSE THAT'S THEIR ART

55
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:28,797
OF THE DEAL.

56
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,099
>> NO QUESTION BOTH SIDES ARE

57
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:32,400
NEGOTIATING AT THIS POINT.

58
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,802
WHETHER THIS ENDS UP WITH A

59
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,371
MEETING OR NOT, I DON'T THINK

60
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,272
ANYBODY CAN KNOW.

61
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:39,374
BUT WE CAN'T HAVE OUR PRESIDENT

62
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:41,243
MEET WITH SOMEBODY WHO SAID THE

63
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:44,045
KINDS OF THINGS HE HAS SAID AND

64
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:45,580
THREATENED THE UNITED STATES

65
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,182
WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

66
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:48,950
I THINK THERE HAS TO BE ATONING

67
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,019
DOWN OF THE RHETORIC ON THEIR

68
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:51,820
SIDE BEFORE A PRODUCTIVE

69
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,187
MEETING.

70
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:53,855
>> Bill: IN YOUR LAW AND YOUR

71
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:55,724
WORLD YOU LOOK FOR GOOD FAITH

72
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:56,291
AND BAD FAITH.

73
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,994
BAD FAITH TAKES YOU DOWN A BAD

74
00:01:58,994 --> 00:01:59,294
ROAD.

75
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:00,161
GOOD FAITH, HOWEVER, DOES NOT.

76
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,497
YOU HAVE THE RELEASE OF THESE

77
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,465
THREE AMERICANS.

78
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:08,770
THAT WAS A GOOD FAITH GESTURE.

79
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,372
MIKE POMPEO INVITED TO

80
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:12,941
PYONGYANG TWICE IN A MONTH IS A

81
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:13,875
GOOD FAITH GESTURE.

82
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,377
WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THEIR

83
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:16,711
NUCLEAR PROGRAM HAS CRIPPLED OR

84
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:18,113
NOT THEY STILL HAD THE

85
00:02:18,113 --> 00:02:19,080
IMPLOSION OF THE MOUNTAIN

86
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,781
EARLIER TODAY.

87
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:22,117
THAT IS A GOOD FAITH GESTURE.

88
00:02:22,117 --> 00:02:24,419
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

89
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,757
>> WHEN ROBERT KENNEDY HAD TO

90
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:33,528
NEGOTIATE WITH THE SOVIET UNION

91
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,598
OVER CUBA HE SAID DON'T LISTEN

92
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:38,934
TO WHAT THEY SAY BUT WHAT THEY

93
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:39,200
DO.

94
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,369
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN NORTH

95
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:45,707
RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES.

96
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,242
WHAT THEY'VE SAID IS TERRIBLE.

97
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:48,710
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT SAYING IN

98
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,612
RESPONSE TO THEIR SAYING BUT

99
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:51,913
STILL KEEPING OPEN THE OPTION

100
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:53,848
OF HAVING THE MEETING.

101
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:56,785
SO IF I HAVE TO MAKE A

102
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:57,586
LONG-TERM PREDICTION I PREDICT

103
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:59,721
WE HAVE THE MEETING AND

104
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,622
SOMEWHAT BETTER TERMS.

105
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:03,224
>> Bill: BETTER TERMS.

106
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,392
UNDECLARED AT THIS POINT.

107
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,061
>> THERE IS PROBABLY A LOT OF

108
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:06,995
STUFF GOING ON BEHIND THE

109
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:07,662
SCENES.

110
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:09,564
>> Bill: I AGREE WITH CHINA AND

111
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,901
THE MOVE YESTERDAY IN THE SOUTH

112
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,704
CHINA SEA WHEN THE UNITED

113
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:17,372
STATES DISINVITED THE CHINESE

114
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:20,108
FROM MILITARY MANEUVERS.

115
00:03:20,108 --> 00:03:23,511
>> AND CONSIDER THE IRAN DEAL.

116
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:24,579
WHEN HE SAYS SOMETHING, HE

117
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,448
MEANS IT WHEN HE PULLED OUT OF

118
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:28,516
THE IRAN DEAL.

119
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:30,652
HE IS READY TO RENEGOTIATE THE

120
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:31,086
IRAN DEAL.

121
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,287
THESE ARE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN

122
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:32,754
MANY RESPECTS.

123
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,623
>> Bill: LAST POINT.

124
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:36,491
THE LAST MISSILE TEST THE NORTH

125
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,394
KOREANS CONDUCTED WAS IN

126
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:40,061
NOVEMBER OF 2017.

127
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:41,963
IN MY ESTIMATION THAT'S THE

128
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:43,131
MOST CRITICAL ASPECT TO WATCH

129
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:43,832
RIGHT NOW.

130
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:45,467
THERE MAY NOT BE ANOTHER

131
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:46,401
UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR TEST BUT

132
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:48,737
THEY SEEM TO HAVE AN ABILITY TO

133
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:50,171
FIRE OFF A MISSILE OR TEST A

134
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:52,507
ROCKET AT A TIME OF THEIR

135
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:52,874
CHOOSING.

136
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:54,042
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN SHOW THE

137
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:55,777
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE WORLD

138
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,412
THAT NORTH KOREAN SITUATION IS

139
00:03:57,412 --> 00:03:58,246
STABILIZED, I THINK THAT'S THE

140
00:03:58,246 --> 00:03:59,581
WAY YOU DO IT.

141
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:03,785
IF THERE IS NO MORE TESTING,

142
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,821
THAT'S THE SIGNAL TO CHINA, TO

143
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:08,957
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WITH THE

144
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:09,691
MID-TERM ELECTION SIX MONTHS

145
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:11,292
AWAY WE HAVE THE SITUATION

146
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,427
RIGHT NOW STILL UNDER CONTROL

147
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:13,628
DESPITE THE NEWS.

148
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,996
>> I AGREE WITH THAT.

149
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:17,666
IT IS THE MISSILE THAT IS

150
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,668
INCOMPLETE IN THEIR INVENTORY.

151
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:21,101
THEY HAVEN'T YET SHOWN THE

152
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:22,604
WORLD THAT THEY CAN SEND A

153
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:24,372
MISSILE TO THE SHORES OF THE

154
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:24,839
UNITED STATES.

155
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,408
THEY ALREADY HAVE DEVELOPED

156
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:26,975
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPON.

157
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,610
THEY DON'T NEED TO TEST THE

158
00:04:28,610 --> 00:00:00,000
NUCLEAR WEAPON AS MUCH AS THEY
