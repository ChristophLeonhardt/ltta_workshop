Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences which puts out the Oscar Academy Award has decided to do something a little different and they have decided to change things up first of all they are going to enforce the three-hour rule you are only going to have three hours of Oscar that is a firm promise they will be off the stage why those little those Shepherd hooks where they pull you off they're up there they're gonna make it happen it's gonna fit and to do that they're gonna get rid of some of the lesser Awards which is fine with me that's short Animated Feature I gotta tell you I haven't seen a short animated feature that I was interested in since since they were doing Bugs Bunny should stuff in the in the 40s so that's that's probably not a loss you know best documentary about an old man who's sad okay no goodbyes we don't need that so cut out a few of those you know some of the technical words best sound editing I don't even know what sound editing is how do you edit sound I don't want to know I never understood it was always these guys in glasses they come thank you we the Hulk irani tea is very excited about the about this award for our noises thank you know just okay those are good so that's probably good idea and then they're gonna have instead in addition to Best Picture they're gonna have best popular picture that's popular picture so basically they're gonna give an award for movies people actually like I don't know is this like the People's Choice Award I don't know how this is gonna work I guess it's a way to you know kind of kind of doing nod to people hey we're gonna give this statue to a movie that you guys actually liked and then we're gonna go back to movies that my god would make you want to gouge out your eyes rather than to watch okay all right all right fine I you know no biggie cuz I don't think I'm gonna be watching the Academy Awards anyway just kind of kind of the point I'm not sure you will either because they're not doing something about the big problem which is three hours now three hours of insults I guess there pack the insults tighter so there is not so much white space between the insults the simple fact is that I have no desire to watch a bunch of people who have nothing but contempt for me you
