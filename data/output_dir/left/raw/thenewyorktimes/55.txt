[somber music playing]

00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,904
[airplane engine]

3
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:35,010
See it?

4
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,497
Yeah.

5
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:39,226
Am I just seeing things?

6
00:03:39,226 --> 00:03:40,714
Oh, jeez.

7
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:42,698
Oh, they’re people.

8
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:43,690
Oh.

9
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,666
Oh, jeez, they’re people.

10
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,658
They’re people.

11
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:54,106
They’re people.

12
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:05,985
[quiet music playing]

13
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:56,550
I’m going to
take us right here

14
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,567
to this tree where there
in shade and there is sun,

15
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,793
so you could have
which ever you prefer.

16
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,800
So we don’t get
in everyone’s way,

17
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,970
if we can stay over here
on the left hand side,

18
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,110
we’ll be in good shape.

19
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,060
The memorial is
designed for you

20
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,980
to make physical
contact with it,

21
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,900
to actually touch the names.

22
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,590
So do not feel that the
appropriate behavior

23
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,140
that shows respect
is to be standoffish.

24
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,340
It is not.

25
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,050
The only thing
that we do ask —

26
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,570
and I really doubt that any
of you would have the impulse

27
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,770
to do this anyhow —

28
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,810
do not put things on the name.

29
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,280
Coats, elbows, cups,
bags, anything like that.

30
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,870
The other thing I
want to say to you

31
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,810
is this was truly — you’re 
an international group

32
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,410
of people —

33
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,440
this was the World
Trade Center.

34
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,640
People from over 90 countries
died here that morning.

35
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,810
They were Christians, Jews,
Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists,

36
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,130
atheists.

37
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,280
Some made their way in
the world washing dishes,

38
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,480
others ran powerful companies,
but almost every single one

39
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,740
of them dies that morning
because they do something

40
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,660
that all of us do with
most of our lives —

41
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,868
they woke up and
they went to work.

42
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:16,194
[somber music playing]

43
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:21,630
Excuse me.

44
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,407
Hello.

45
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:23,240
Hello, hello, hello.

46
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,590
There’s no smoking
in the plaza.

47
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,482
No smoking in the plaza.

48
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:28,440
That’s quite all right.

49
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,410
Thank you.

50
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,980
So I want to talk to
you about the pools.

51
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,820
Directly in front of
you is the south pool.

52
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,080
The south pool stands in the
footprint of the South Tower,

53
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,360
World Trade Center number two.

54
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,660
So that’s exactly where
World Trade Center number two

55
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,010
stood.

56
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,110
Can everyone see
that line of trees

57
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,910
that goes around the pool?

58
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,360
That line of trees
represents the outer wall

59
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,350
of the building.

60
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,540
So that means in
a few minutes when

61
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,260
we go up to see the falls
and you go past those trees,

62
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,950
you will be standing in what
was once the lobby of World

63
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,890
Trade Center number two.

64
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,600
You’re going to see the falls.

65
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,900
The falls come out in
individual rivulets,

66
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,680
one for each person
killed on 9/11.

67
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,780
Goes down about 20 feet
or so into a huge pool.

68
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,730
In the center of the
pool, another opening

69
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,950
goes on another 10 feet or so.

70
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,080
No matter how
hard you try, you

71
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,610
can’t see the bottom of that
opening because it’s a void,

72
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,490
and the void is a
symbol of the emptiness

73
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,180
that we feel here
over the loss of life.

74
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,030
I’m sure all of you can see
the water under the names.

75
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,520
That water comes
directly from the pool.

76
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,150
What someone will do,
visiting a loved one —

77
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,490
and please feel free to
do the very, very same —

78
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,470
take their hand,
put it in the water,

79
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,110
rub their hand over a name.

80
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,670
Water, of course,
a symbol of life.

81
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,240
And notice how the
names are on the wall.

82
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,300
They are not arranged
in alphabetical order.

83
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,950
For example, people who
worked in the same office

84
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,400
in this building,
they’re together.

85
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Firefighters out on the
same firehouse, together.

86
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,010
Police officers out of
the same police precinct,

87
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:16,970
together.

88
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,210
We call that
meaningful adjacencies.

89
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,570
People together in
death just the way

90
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,047
they were together in life.

91
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:28,130
I have a stupid question.

92
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,930
The names of the killers.

93
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,452
Are they —

94
00:10:30,452 --> 00:10:31,160
Absolutely not.

95
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,030
Not.

96
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,050
Absolutely not.

97
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,725
Yeah.

98
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:35,060
The only place
you’ll find them

99
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,740
is if you should
go into the museum,

100
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,522
there’s a special part
that deals with Al Qaeda.

101
