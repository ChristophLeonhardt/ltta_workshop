ON THE FRONT END BETTER. 
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS, IT DOES 
NOT SERVE THE COUNTRY WELL WHEN 
WE HAVE THESE RAZOR THIN 
MARGINS, APPROVAL OF A SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE OR APPROVAL OF 
LEGISLATION OR CABINET NOMINEE. 
WE HAVE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE 
WE ARE BACK TO SIMPLE 
MAJORITIES, THERE'S A VOICE FOR 
THE MODERATE AND INCENTIVE TO 
BE PART OF THAT, THERE'S MORE 
COLLABORATION AND WORKING 
TOGETHER. 
OTHERWISE I FEAR FOR THE 
COUNTRY AND THE DOWNWARD VIRAL 
WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICAL 
DISCOURSE AND DISCUSSION ABOUT 
POLICIES IMPACTING MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE'S LIVES EVERY DAY. 
MUCH LESS THE SUPREME COURT AND 
ALL THE THINGS THAT WILL COME 
BEFORE IT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 
DECADES. 
>> LESLIE, IT IS HARD TO DENY, 
IT IS A GOOD WEEK FOR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, HE ACCOMPLISHED A GREAT 
DEAL. 
HIS BIGGEST IS THE SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE, A CAMPAIGN 
PROMISE HE MADE FOR SOME TIME 
NOW. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD 
NUMEROUS SUCCESSES THAT DO NOT 
GET TALKED ABOUT A LOT, THERE'S 
USUALLY A CLOUD AROUND THEM, 
THE BOTTOM LINE, HE MANAGES TO 
EXECUTE UPON THEM AND DELIVER 
ON THOSE CAMPAIGN PROMISES, NOT 
SOMETHING YOU SEE IN WASHINGTON 
AND HE DOES IT WITH SHARP 
ELBOWS. 
WE HAVE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS 
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT HIS 
CHARACTER AND STYLE, UNORTHODOX 
APPROACH. 
WHEN IT CAME TO THIS ISSUE, HE 
PUSHED AHEAD DESPITE THE FEW 
TIMES HE WAS WAFFLING ON JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, I JUST MET HIM A FEW 
WEEKS AGO. 
ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE WAS NOT 
INVITED TO THE PARTY ANYMORE. 
BECAUSE OF THIS AND WHAT WE 
HEARD EARLIER, REPUBLICANS GOT 
ENERGIZED, THEY CAME TOGETHER, 
ESTABLISHED REPUBLICANS, 
CONSERVATIVES, WOMEN, THEY DID 
NOT WANT TO SEE A JUDGE TREATED 
UNFAIRLY. 
THAT LOOKS GOOD ON THE 
POLITICAL MAP, NOW YOU WILL SEE 
A CONFIRMATION. 
THE REAL QUESTION IS IF THE 
ENERGY IS MAINTAINED, I BELIEVE 
IT WILL BE ON THE LEFT, ON THE 
RIGHT, THEY HAVE SEEN THE 
SUCCESS WITH THE PRESIDENT. 
>> MICHAEL, WHAT ARE YOU 
LOOKING AT THE NEXT COUPLE 
WEEKS FOR MIDTERMS? 
>> I'M WATCHING TO SEE IF THE 
ENERGY WE HAVE SEEN STAYS IN 
PLACE AND HOW IT CHANGES. 
IT CAN ALL TURN AROUND, WHO 
KNOWS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL 
SAY TOMORROW. 
WE DON'T KNOW. 
SOMEBODY SMART SAID, A WEEK AGO,
DEMOCRATS WERE AT A NINE ON A 
10 SCALE, REPUBLICANS 6 1/2. 
NOW REPUBLICANS ARE 8 1/2, 
CLOSE TO CLOSING THE GAPS. 
IF THAT STATES THE CASE, IT 
MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR 
DEMOCRATS TO TAKE THE SENATE, 
THEHOUSE IS GONE FOR 
REPUBLICANS, IT MAKES THE RACE 
MORE COMPETITIVE. 
WILL THE PASSION STAY? 
I HEARD REPUBLICAN SAY, I'M 
WORRIED, AFTER THE WIN COMES, 
ASSUMING IT DOES, REPUBLICANS 
MAY SAY GOOD AND GO HOME AND GO 
BACK TO WATCHING FOOTBALL WHICH 
IS MORE FUN THAN WATCHING 
POLITICS AND THEY DO NOT SHOW 
UP IN NOVEMBER. 
>> MICHAEL GRAHAM, LESLIE 
SANCHEZ AND LINDA TRAN, THANK 
YOU FOR JOINING US. 
WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.  
WE ARE WATCHING LIVE COVERAGE 
OF THE FINAL VOTE, EXPECTED AT 
ANY MOMENT IN SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN, ALWAYS 
IN.
>>> KAVANAUGH APPEARS TO HAVE 
ENOUGH VOTES TO BE CONFIRMED 
AFTER TWO LAWMAKERS CONFIRMED 
THEIR SUPPORT FRIDAY AFTERNOON. 
THE SENATE IS SET TO CAST THEIR 
FINAL VOTE LATER TODAY. 
WE REPORT FROM CAPITOL HILL. 
>> Reporter: SUSAN COLLINS 
ENDED WEEKS OF SUPREME COURT 
DRAMA IN THE SENATE WITH THESE 
WORDS. 
>> I WILL VOTE TO CONFIRM JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
>> Reporter: IN A 43 MINUTE 
SPEECH FRIDAY, THE MODERATE 
REPUBLICAN REVIEWED HIS 
JUDICIAL RECORD AND LOOKED OVER 
THE FBI INQUIRY AND TESTIMONY 
OF DOCTOR CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD, WHO ACCUSED KAVANAUGH OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT WHEN THEY WERE 
TEENAGERS. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, SHE SAID 
THE CERTAINTY WAS NOT THERE. 
>> THE FOUR WITNESSES SHE NAMED 
COULD NOT CORROBORATE ANY OF 
THE EVENTS. 
>> Reporter: MOMENTS LATER, 
DEMOCRAT JOE MANCHIN OF WEST 
VIRGINIA WILL ALSO VOTE TO 
CONFIRM KAVANAUGH. 
HE STRUGGLED TO BE HEARD OVER 
PROTESTERS. 
>> I LOOKED AT WAS IN FRONT OF 
ME AND MADE A DECISION. 
>> Reporter: ALASKAN SENATOR 
LISA MURKOWSKI WAS THE ONLY 
REPUBLICAN THAT OPPOSED 
KAVANAUGH. 
>> A JUDGE SHOULD ACT IN ALL 
TIMES IN A MANNER THAT PROMOTES 
PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. 
>> Reporter: WITH KAVANAUGH'S 
CONFIRMATION ALL BUT CERTAIN, 
DIEHARD SENATORS ARGUED 
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT TO A 
MOSTLY EMPTY SENATE CHAMBER. 
>> IS HE FIT TO BE A JURIST IN 
THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE SAID 
JUSTICE IN OUR COUNTRY OCCURS. 
>> WE CANNOT SET A STANDARD OF 
GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT 
BECAUSE THEN ANYBODY CAN MAKE 
ANY CHARGE AT ANY TIME. 
>> Reporter: IF CONFIRMED, HE 
COULD BE SEATED IN THE HIGH 
COURT IN THE COMING WEEK. 
>> FOR MORE ON THE DECISION OF 
SENATOR MANSION -- JOE MANCHIN. 
TELL US ABOUT THE REACTION IN 
WEST VIRGINIA TO HIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT HE WOULD VOTE FOR 
KAVANAUGH? 
>> BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT, 
PEOPLE HAD A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT 
WOULD HAPPEN, THE PREVAILING 
WISDOM, SUSAN COLLINS MADE HER 
SPEECH YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND 
JOE MANCHIN WOULD COME OUT WITH 
HIS POSITION, WITHIN SECONDS OF 
SUSAN COLLINS CONCLUDING HER 
SPEECH, HE TWEETED A STATEMENT 
SAYING HE WOULD CONFIRM. 
AMONG REPUBLICANS, THE GENERAL 
LINE WAS THAT -- JOE MANCHIN 
WILL SPEAK HIS MIND UNTIL THE 
VOTE IS DECIDED. 
DEMOCRATS WERE DEFLATED, JOE 
MANCHIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN WILLING 
TO VOTE WITH DONALD TRUMP. 
HE USUALLY COMES THROUGH AT THE 
END OF THE DAY FOR DEMOCRATS. 
YOU LOOK AT THE AFFORDABLE CARE 
ACT REPEAL EFFORTS OR THE TAX 
BILL, THIS WAS A KICK IN THE 
TEETH, 30 DAYS BEFORE TITLE 
ACTION. 
>> WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, 
WHAT DETERMINED JOE MANCHIN TO 
COME FORWARD AND VOTE YES? 
WAS IT THE VOTE OF COLLINS? 
WHY DO YOU THINK HE CHOSE TO 
COME FORWARD? 
>> IT IS HARD TO SAY. 
IT'S UNDENIABLE THERE'S A 
POLITICAL ASPECT TO IT, WHEN 
THE VOTE  WAS DECIDED, PICK A 
WINNER. 
WHAT HE WAS SAYING YESTERDAY IN 
HIS INTERVIEW WITH CNN, I 
BELIEVE DOCTOR FORD, I DON'
BELIEVE IT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH, 
I THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED. 
THERE IS A QUESTION OF 
PRECEDENT AND STANDARD OF 
EVIDENCE, WHAT DOES IT TAKE OR 
NOT TAKE TO DISQUALIFY A 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE? 
I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
KNOW HOW POPULAR DONALD TRUMP 
IS, HE WON BY 42 POINTS, HE 
REMAINS POPULAR IN THE STATE. 
WE SAW SUPPORT DIP NATIONALLY, 
THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE 
PRESIDENT, NOMINATE SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICES. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY DOSE 
>> WE WANT TO INTERRUPT TO TAKE 
YOU TO SENATOR SCHUMER ON THE 
SENATE FLOOR MAKING A SPEECH. 
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT 
BELONG ON THE BENCH BECAUSE HE 
WAS CHOSEN BY A PRESIDENT AND 
FAR RIGHT ORGANIZATION, BOTH 
DEDICATED TO OVERTURNING AND 
UNDERMINING ROE V WADE AND HE 
DID NOTHING TO REFUTE THE 
PRESUMPTION HE WOULD WANT TO 
OVERTURN IT TOO. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG 
ON THE BENCH BECAUSE HE WAS 
CHOSEN BY FAR RIGHT 
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BENT ON 
REPEALING HEALTHCARE 
PROTECTIONS FOR AMERICANS WITH 
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND HE 
DID NOTHING TO REFUTE THE 
PRESUMPTION HE WOULD TOO. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG 
ON THE BENCH BECAUSE HE BELIEVES
PRESIDENTS SHOULD NOT BE 
SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATIONS OF 
AN KIND WHILE IN OFFICE. 
A DISTORTION OF OUR FOUNDING 
PRINCIPAL. 
NO PERSON IS ABOVE THE LAW. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG 
IN THE BENCH BECAUSE HIS 
JURISPRUDENCE IS DEEPLY 
SKEPTICAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTIONS, CONSUMER 
PROTECTIONS, WORKERS RIGHTS, 
CIVIL RIGHTS, LGBT RIGHTS, AND 
TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS WITH 
NATIVE AMERICANS AND A HOST OF 
OTHER HARD EARNED RIGHTS. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG 
ON THE BENCH BECAUSE HE HAS 
REPEATEDLY MISLED THE SENATE, 
PUTTING INTO SERIOUS DOUBT HIS 
CREDIBILITY AND A JUDGE MUST BE 
CREDIBLE, BELIEVABLE, AND HONEST
, ABOVE ALL. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG 
ON THE BENCH BECAUSE HE IS AN 
EXTREME PARTISAN, SOMETHING WE 
HAVE SEEN FROM HIS EARLIEST 
DAYS IN HIS CAREER. 
AND RECONFIRMED WHEN HE GAVE 
ONE OF THE BITTEREST, MOST 
PARTISAN TESTIMONIES EVER 
PRESENTED BY A NOMINEE. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG 
ON THE BENCH BECAUSE OF HIS 
DEMEANOR, HIS PARTISAN CREED 
WILL GO DOWN IGNOMINIOUSLY IN 
HISTORY AND MADE IT CLEAR IT 
WOULD BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE 
FOR HIM TO RULE IMPARTIALLY 
FROM THE SUPREME COURT. 
JUDGES MUST BE TEMPERAMENT, 
JUDICIOUS, EVENHANDED. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS ANYTHING BUT 
THAT. 
REPUBLICAN LEADERS KNEW BEFORE 
HE WAS NOMINATED, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WAS A FLAWED CHOICE. 
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP SELECTED 
HIM, REPUBLICANS DECIDED THEY 
HAD TO RUSH AND THROUGH, -- 
RUSH HIM THROUGH, HE BECAME A 
STEAMROLLER OVER TRUTH AND 
FAIRNESS AND BIPARTISAN 
COOPERATION, ANY MEANS NECESSARY
TO REACH THEIR DESIRED END. 
THEY BLAMED DOCTOR FORD AND 
DEMOCRATS FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
FLAWS. 
THEY WERE INTENT ON SHROUDING 
THE TRUTH BECAUSE THEY KNEW IF 
THE TRUTH CAME TO LIGHT, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WOULD BE EXPOSED AS A 
TRULY FLAWED NOMINEE. 
MY COLLEAGUES, FELLOW 
AMERICANS, WHAT IS THE 
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE? OUR 
COUNTRY NEEDS TO HAVE A 
RECKONING ON THESE ISSUES, 
THERE'S ONLY ONE REMEDY, CHANGE 
MUST COME FROM WHERE CHANGE IN 
AMERICA ALWAYS BEGINS, THE 
BALLOT BOX. 
AMERICANS, SO MANY MILLIONS 
OUTRAGED BY WHAT HAPPENED HERE, 
THERE'S ONE ANSWER, VOTE. 
IF YOU BELIEVE DOCTOR FORD, AND 
OTHER BRAVE WOMEN THAT CAME 
FORWARD, AND YOU WANT TO 
VINDICATE THEIR SACRIFICE, 
VOTE. 
IF YOU BELIEVE THE SUPREME COURT
SHOULD UPHOLD WOMEN'S RIGHTS, 
VOTE. 
IF YOU BELIEVE THE SUPREME COURT
MUST PROTECT HEALTHCARE AND OUR 
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT 
ARE PROTECTED NOW, VOTE. 
IF YOU BELIEVE THE SUPREME 
COURT SHOULD DEFEND WORKERS, 
CONSUMERS, THE ENVIRONMENT, 
CIVIL RIGHTS, NATIVE 
POPULATIONS, VOTE. 
IF YOU BELIEVE THE SUPREME 
COURT SHOULD BE A CHECK ON AN 
OVERREACHING PRESIDENT, VOTE. 
IF YOU BELIEVE THE PROCESS IN 
THE SENATE WAS A SHAM, AND YOU 
BELIEVE AMERICANS DESERVE 
BETTER, VOTE. 
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICES SHOULD CONFORM 
TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF 
CHARACTER, IMPARTIALITY, 
TEMPERAMENT AND ABOVE ALL, 
HONESTY AND CREDIBILITY, VOTE. 
I UNDERSTAND, I SHARE THE DEEP 
ANGUISH MILLIONS OF AMERICANS 
ARE EXPERIENCING TODAY. 
I SAY TO YOU, MY FELLOW 
AMERICANS, THERE IS ONE ANSWER.
>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
THE SENATE FLOOR, SENATORS ARE 
ENTERING THE CHAMBER TO MAKE 
THE FINAL VOTE ON BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, WHO IS EXPECTED TO 
MAKE IT TO THE SUPREME COURT 
THIS AFTERNOON. 
I WANT TO BRING THE PANEL, 
MICHAEL GRAHAM, A POLITICAL 
CONTRIBUTOR, HE JOINED US FROM 
BOSTON. 
MICHAEL, YOU HEARD SENATOR 
SCHUMER, POINTING FINGERS, 
SAYING REPUBLICANS STEAMROLLED 
OVER THE TRUTH. 
WE KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A 
POLITICAL FIGHT BACK AND FORTH. 
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? 
>> I THOUGHT SENATOR SCHUMER 
MADE A BOTH PRINCIPLED AND 
PARTISAN APPEAL AT THE END, GO 
VOTE. 
ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES. 
IT IS INTERESTING, ON THE ONE 
HAND, IT IS A GREAT WAY TO DEAL 
WITH POLITICS, IF YOU'RE NOT 
HAPPY, VOTE. 
ANOTHER FIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS, TO 
WIN VOTES, PLAY ON PEOPLE'S 
EMOTIONS AND ANGER AND UPSET 
AND DRIVE THEM TO THE POLLS. 
LONG-STANDING POLITICAL 
TRADITION, NOT A DEMOCRATIC 
CHECK -- TRICK, IT IS 100% 
PARTISAN. 
GIVEN VIRTUALLY EVERY DEMOCRAT 
EXCEPT FOR THREE ANNOUNCED THEY 
WOULD VOTE AGAINST HIM LONG 
BEFORE THEY HEARD THE NAME 
DOCTOR FORD, IT HAS BEEN 
PARTISAN FROM THE BEGINNING. 
>> I WILL TAKE YOU BACK, MICHAEL
, WILL TAKE THE VIEWERS TO THE 
SENATE FLOOR. 
WE SEE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER 
MITCH McCONNELL SPEAKING AHEAD 
OF THE VOTE. 
>> THAT MR. PRESIDENT IS WHY 
TODAY IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT DAY. 
THAT IS WHY THE VOTE WE TAKE 
THIS AFTERNOON, A VOTE TO 
CONFIRM A NEW ASSOCIATE JUSTICE 
OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE 
UNITED STATES REPRESENTS ONE OF 
THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL DECISIONS
A SENATOR EVERY MAKES. THE 
MEMBERS OF THIS BODY ARE DUTY-
BOUND TO ENSURE WE CONFIRMED 
JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT, 
WHO ARE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 
HIGHEST CHARACTER AND THE MOST 
SUPERLATIVE QUALIFICATIONS. 
FORTUNATELY, THAT IS THE SORT 
OF NOMINEE WHO STANDS BEFORE US 
TODAY. 
12 WEEKS AGO, THE PRESIDENT 
NOMINATED A JURIST DESCRIBED BY 
LEGAL PEERS OF ALL POLITICAL 
STRIPES, AS A SUPERSTAR, A 
SERIOUS SCHOLAR, AND WHO IS 
LEGENDARY FOR HIS PREPARATION. 
AND POSSESSES THE 
QUALIFICATIONS, THE TEMPERAMENT 
AND JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHIES TO BE 
AN EXCELLENT ASSOCIATE JUSTICE. 
THE PRESIDENT NOMINATED A 
BRILLIANT STUDENT OF THE LAW. 
THOSE WHO TAUGHT AND KNEW THE 
NOMINEE AT YALE SAY, "IT IS 
HARD TO NAME ANYONE WITH 
JUDICIAL CREDENTIALS AS STRONG 
AS JUDGE KAVANAUGH". THEY 
DESCRIBE A TRUE INTELLECTUAL, A 
LEADING THINKER AND WONDERFUL 
MENTOR AND TEACHER. 
AND THOSE HE HAS MEANT TOWARD, 
A DIVERSE GROUP OF BRIGHT YOUNG 
LAWYERS THAT CLERKED FOR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH TALK ABOUT HIS WORK 
ETHIC, UNFLINCHING HONEST 
ADVICE, AND HIS FUNDAMENTAL 
HUMILITY. 
FOR 12 WEEKS, THE SENATE HAS 
SEEN THIS IS NOT EMPTY PRAISE. 
WE HAVE SEEN THE LEGENDARY 
PREPARATION OF A TIRELESS JUDGE
, WE HAVE SEEN THE PATIENCE OF 
A COMMITTED MENTOR AND TEACHER. 
WE HAVE SEEN THE HUMILITY OF A 
TRUE INTELLECTUAL THAT LET HIS 
RECORD SPEAK FOR ITSELF. 
EACH OF US HAVE SEEN THIS FOR 
OURSELVES. 
EVERY SENATOR THAT CAME INTO 
THIS PROCESS WITH AN OPEN MIND 
HAS SEEN THE SAME BRETT 
KAVANAUGH FIRSTHAND. 
WE HAVE SEEN HIS BRILLIANCE, 
PAINSTAKING THOROUGHNESS ON 
DISPLAY IN THE 300+ OPINIONS HE 
ISSUED IN THE DC CIRCUIT, FOR 
12 YEARS JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
EXCELLED ON THE BENCH MANY 
EXPERTS SAY IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT SEAT OF THE COURT IN 
OUR NATION. 
WE HAVE SEEN HIS GENEALOGY AND 
KINDNESS FIRSTHAND IN MEETINGS 
WITH THE NOMINEE. 
PRECISELY, THE COLLEGIAL 
APPROACH SO NECESSARY IN THE 
COURT. 
WE HAVE SEEN HIS PROFESSIONAL 
EXCELLENCE IS REVIEWED PAGES OF 
DOCUMENTS PERTAINING TO JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S CAREER, THAN FOR 
ANY OTHER SUPREME COURT 
NOMINATION IN OUR HISTORY. 
PAGES THAT DEPICT A METICULOUS 
AND DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT. 
AND YES, WE HAVE NOW STUDIED 
THE RESULTS OF SEVEN FBI 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS, 
INQUIRES THAT PRODUCED NO 
EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER TO 
CORROBORATE ANY PRIOR 
MISCONDUCT, RATHER CONSISTENT 
WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS 
NOMINEES STERLING CHARACTER. 
THIS HISTORICALLY TALL MOUNTAIN 
OF EVIDENCE, ADDS UP TO ONE 
CLEAR MESSAGE, JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH IS AMONG THE VERY 
BEST OUR NATION HAS TO OFFER. 
HE WILL MAKE THE SENATE AND THE 
COUNTRY PROUD. 
HE WILL SERVE WITH DISTINCTION 
ON OUR HIGHEST COURT. 
HE UNQUESTIONABLY DESERVES 
CONFIRMATION AND THE COUNTRY 
DESERVES SUCH A SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE. 
NOW MR. PRESIDENT, AS I HAVE 
EXPLAINED, THE STAKES ARE 
ALWAYS HIGH WHERE A SUPREME 
COURT CONFIRMATION IS CONCERNED.
THIS TIME, THE STAKES ARE 
HIGHER. 
A LOT HIGHER. 
THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST.
I CAN'T SUM THIS UP BETTER THAN 
OUR FRIEND AND DISTINGUISHED 
COLLEAGUE, FROM MAINE PUT IT IN 
HISTORIC REMARKS YESTERDAY. 
THIS IS WHAT THE SENIOR SENATOR 
FROM MAINE SAID, IT IS ONE 
PASSIONS ARE MOST INFLAMED THAT 
FAIRNESS IS MOST IN JEOPARDY. 
SHE SAID WHEN PASSIONS ARE MOST 
INFLAMED IS WHEN FAIRNESS IS 
MOST IN JEOPARDY. 
WE ALL KNOW THE EVENTS OF 
RECENT WEEKS HAVE STRAINED THE 
COUNTRY AND FLAMED PARTISA 
DISCOURSE. 
MORE CRITICALLY, OUR COMMITMENT 
TO THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF 
FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE IS ALSO 
BEING TESTED. 
BASIC PRINCIPLES OF FAIRNESS 
AND JUSTICE BEING TESTED RIGHT 
HERE. 
A VOTE TO CONFIRM JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH TODAY IS A VOTE TO 
SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE ABOUT WHAT 
THE SENATE IS. 
THIS IS AN INSTITUTION WHERE 
THE EVIDENCE AND THE FACTS 
MATTER, THIS IS AN INSTITUTION 
WHERE THE EVIDENCE AND THE 
FACTS MATTER. 
THIS IS THE CHAMBER IN WHICH 
THE POLITICS OF INTIMIDATION AND
PERSONAL DESTRUCTION DO NOT WIN 
THE DAY. 
THIS IS THE BODY, WHOSE MEMBERS 
THEMSELVES, UPHOLD THE SAME 
COMMITMENT TO AMERICAN JUSTICE 
WE SEEK IN THE JUDGES WE 
EXAMINE. 
A VOTE TO CONFIRM JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH TODAY IS A VOTE TO 
END THIS BRIEF, DARK CHAPTER IN 
THE SENATE'S HISTORY AND TURN 
THE PAGE TOWARDS A BRIGHTER 
TOMORROW. 
THE CHAMBER WE ARE PRIVILEGED 
TO OCCUPY IS OFTEN CALLED THE 
WORLD'S GREATEST DELIBERATIVE 
BODY FOR GOOD REASON, WHEN THE 
RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD, WHEN THE 
HOUR IS CRITICAL, WHEN A 
HISTORIC PRESIDENT -- PRECEDENT 
NEEDS TO BE SET, THE U.S. 
SENATE MOST OFTEN FINDS ITS WAY 
TO DOING WHAT IS RIGHT. 
TODAY, WE CAN HONOR THAT HISTORY
, WE CAN VOTE TO TURN AWAY FROM 
THE DARKNESS, WE CAN VOTE TO SET
A PRECEDENT ABOUT FAIRNESS AND 
JUDGMENT THAT WILL DEFINE THIS 
BODY FOR THE BETTER. 
WE CAN VOTE TO CONFIRM AN 
EXCELLENT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
THAT WILL MAKE THE SENATE AND 
AMERICAN PEOPLE PROUD. 
I YIELD THE FLOOR.

>> YOU'RE WATCHING THE LIVE 
FOOTAGE OF THE FINAL VOTE IN 
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
I WILL BRING IN POLITICAL 
CONTRIBUTOR, MOLLY HOOPER WHO 
JOINED US NOW, A CAPITOL HILL 
REPORTED. 
I CAN STILL HEAR THE 
PROTESTERS. 
WHAT DO YOU HEAR? 
>> I HEAR WHAT YOU HEAR, MANY ú 
HEARD THE PAST FEW WEEKS, EVEN 
BEFORE THE ALLEGATIONS OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT BY DOCTOR FORD. 
THIS NOMINATION HAS EMBROILED 
ACTIVE DEMOCRATIC BASIS THAT 
OPPOSE THE NOMINEE, THEY HAVE 
BEEN VERY VOCAL, YOU LOOK BACK 
AT THE HEARINGS, THE ORIGINAL 
HEARING FOR MATT CAVANAUGH'S 
CONFIRMATION, THE FIRST FEW 
DAYS ON AN HOURLY BASIS, SCORES 
OF PEOPLE TAKEN OUT AND 
ARRESTED BECAUSE THEY WOULD 
STAND UP AND PROTEST AS THE 
HEARING WAS GOING ON. 
>> THE SERGEANT IN ARMS WILL 
RESTORE ORDER. 
>> I KNOW WE HEAR THEIR 
PROTESTERS. 
IS IS THE FINAL VOTE RIGHT NOW? 
>> YES, IT IS. 
>> I WANT TO BE CLEAR NOT. 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE 
PROTESTERS, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE 
PENCE OPENED THE SESSION SAYING 
YOU CANNOT SHOW EMOTION FROM 
EITHER SIDE, AS WE SAW, THESE 
FOLKS WERE ESCORTED OUT. 
I WANT YOU TO WALK US THROUGH 
THE PROCEDURE AT THIS POINT AS 
THE VOTE IS HAPPENING.  
>> THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BOATS, 
IT IS A MONUMENTAL VOTE, WHAT 
HAPPENS IN THIS TYPE OF VOTE , 
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, THE 
MOST RECENT VERSION OF 
IMMIGRATION REFORM, THE SENATE 
MAJORITY LEADER REQUIRES ALL 
SENATORS SEATED IN THEIR 
ASSIGNED SEATS AS YOU ARE 
WATCHING C-SPAN AND CBSN, YOU 
WILL SEE PICTURES OF THE 
SENATORS IN THEIR SEATS. 
THIS IS NOT A NORMAL PROCEDURE, 
NORMALLY THEY GO UP TO THE 
DIOCESE AND WALK AROUND. 
AT THIS POINT, WE SEE SENATORS 
REMAINING IN THEIR SEATS AND 
CASTING A VOTE, THE TALLY CLERK 
WILL GO THROUGH AND READ THE 
NAMES AND SENATORS WILL VOTE 
ACCORDINGLY. 
>> I WANT TO BRING THE REST OF 
THE PANEL, IF YOU STAY WITH US, 
LESLIE SANCHEZ OF CBS NEWS AND 
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, LINDA 
TRAN AND  DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST,
MICHAEL GRAHAM. 
THEY JOIN US. 
LESLIE, I WILL START WITH YOU. 
I WAS READING A SHORT TIME AGO, 
THE FORMER DEAN OF THE YALE LAW 
SCHOOL SAID KAVANAUGH WILL JOIN 
THE COURT AS THE BLACK RIPPED 
EMBODIMENT OF PARTISAN POWER 
CONSISTENT WITH IDEAL OF 
PARTIAL JUDICIARY. 
ONE DOES THE REPAIR BEGIN FOR 
THE IMAGE OF THE SUPREME COURT? 
>> THAT'S AN OUTSTANDING 
QUESTION. 
FOR THIS REASON, IF YOU THINK 
BACK TO CLARENCE THOMAS, PEOPLE 
TALK ABOUT HIS 10 YEAR SILENCE. 
HE WAS OVER SHATTERED -- 
OVERSHADOWED BY SMART VOICES ON 
THE COURT BEFORE HE CAME TO HIS 
OWN. 
HE NEVE SPOKE PUBLICLY, HE DID 
NOT WRITE OP-ED'S OR LOBBY ON 
HIS OWN BEHALF OR CHANGE HIS 
PUBLIC BRAND OR IMAGE, HE 
FOCUSED ON WHAT HE NEEDED TO 
DO. 
I DO NOT KNOW IF WE WILL GET 
THAT SAME COURTESY FROM BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
I SAY IT AS A COURTESY, THERE 
NEEDS TO BE SPACE TO SEE HIM DO 
WHAT HE DOES BEST. 
THERE'S NOT A QUESTION ON THE 
RIGHT HE'S A QUALIFIED JURISTS, 
THE OTHER ISSUES OF CHARACTER, 
JUDGMENT, TEMPERAMENT THAT WILL 
TAKE A LONG TIME TO HEAL, HE 
HAS TO RESPECT THE NEW ROLE HE 
HAS HONORED AND GIVEN THE GIFT 
TO SERVE. 
I THINK THAT IS THE RESPECT HE 
CAN GET BACK TO THE PUBLIC, DO 
HIS JOB AND NOT POLITICIZE IT 
ANYMORE THAN HE IS RIGHT NOW. 
>> LINDA, I WILL BRING YOU IN 
AS WELL, IT IS HARD TO FORGET 
FOR DEMOCRATS AND PEOPLE ON THE 
LEFT, THE NAME MERRICK GARLAND, 
MORE THAN 400 DAYS, THE SEAT 
WAS LEFT VACANT AS THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO PUSH 
THEM THROUGH. 
THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO WAIT, 
WE DON'T WANT TO VOTE RIGHT 
NOW. 
WE TALK ABOUT THIS MOMENT NOW, 
THIS IS IN THE BAG FOR 
REPUBLICANS. 
WE HEAR FROM THE LEFT MORE, 
THEY WILL WORK TO UNSEAT A MAN 
THAT HAS A LIFETIME 
APPOINTMENT. 
IS THAT REALISTIC? 
>> IF IT WERE TO HAPPEN, IT 
WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST TIME IN 
HISTORY. 
IT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN A VERY 
LONG TIME, OVER 100 YEARS TO BE 
CLEAR. 
IT WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED IN 
THE MODERN ERA. 
YOU HAVE TO SEE IF IT IS A 
RALLYING CALL, KNOWING ELECTION 
DAY IS A FEW SHORT WEEKS AWAY, 
IT IS A WAY TO HELP PEOPLE 
CONTINUING TO FEEL DOWNTRODDEN 
AND UPSET ABOUT THIS MOMENT, 
HELP THEM STAY FOCUSED ON THE 
PRIZE, MAKE SURE PEOPLE TURN 
OUT. 
IT'S LIKE BARACK OBAMA ALWAYS 
SAID, VOTE. 
YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR 
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THAT. 
AS WE WAIT FOR THE FINAL 
RESULTS, YOU HEAR THE PROTESTS 
HAPPENING, IT IS AN INDICATION 
OF WHERE WE HAVE COME, HOW FAR 
WE HAVE FALLEN AS A NATION, THE 
WOUNDS ARE DEEP AND THE RIFT IS 
WHITE. 
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE ONCE 
ELECTION DAY COMES AND GOES, 
ESPECIALLY IF THE HOUSE IS 
TAKEN BY DEMOCRATS. 
>> MICHAEL, I WILL BRING YOU TO 
WEIGH IN. 
WE TALK ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE, FBI, SUPREME COURT, 
THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE THAT 
HAVE DOUBTS IN DEMOCRATIC 
INSTITUTIONS. 
IS THERE A WAY TO REPAIR THIS? 
>> WE HAVE GONE THROUGH BAD 
PHASES BEFORE IN THE 1960S WE 
HAD PEOPLE BEING ASSASSINATED 
ETC. 
YOU HAD REJECTION OF 
INSTITUTIONS, PEOPLE FORGET THE 
MILITARY WAS LOOKED UPON AS 
DISREPUTABLE AND HAD A BAD 
REPUTATION, LOOK WHERE IT IS 
TODAY. 
THINGS WILL CHANGE, THE 
QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THINGS YOU 
CAN DO TO START MOVEMENT IN THE 
SHORT-TERM AND CAN YOU GET 
POLITICAL VALUE OUT OF IT? 
JENNIFER FLAKES FUNDAMENTAL 
ARGUMENT, THERE'S NO WIN FOR 
SOMEONE THAT WALKS ACROSS THE 
AISLE. 
THE OTHER SIDE SMACKS YOU WHEN 
YOU GET THERE AND YOUR SIDE 
SMACKS YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK. 
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND MIDDLE 
GROUND. 
>> HE RAISES A REALLY GOOD 
POINT ABOUT FAITH AND PUBLIC 
AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. 
HISTORICALLY LOOKING BACK, IN 
TERMS OF THE CYCLICAL NATURE, 
AFTER THE 2008 ECONOMY, THE 
DOWNFALL, THERE WAS TREMENDOUS 
SENTIMENT WHERE PEOPLE LOST 
FAITH IN PUBLIC AND 
INSTITUTIONS. 
THEY NEVER BELIEVED THEIR 
401(K)S WOULD DISAPPEAR 
OVERNIGHT OR THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
SO CORRUPT THE WAY THAT IT WAS. 
THEY LOST FAITH ALL THE WAY 
AROUND. 
THE LAST VESTIGE OF HOPE WAS IN 
THE COURT SYSTEM, PEOPLE ARGUED 
ON THE STATE LEVEL THERE'S A 
LOT OF BIAS, JUDGES THAT 
LITIGATE FROM THE BENCH. 
THE SUPREME COURT WAS ALWAYS A 
BEACON, TO TAKE THAT AS WELL 
AND TAINT IT IS HAVING A BIGGER 
IMPACT. 
IT WILL TAKE TIME TO SEE HOW WE 
COME OUT OF THAT, IT IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FOR THE 
COUNTRY. 
>> MICHAEL, WHETHER OR NOT WE 
LIKE TO ADMIT IT, OR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH -- I APOLOGIZE, LET'S 
LISTEN NOW, WE HEAR SENATORS 
VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. 
>> GARDNER, GRAHAM, HATCH, 
HELLER, HOVEN, HITE AND SMITH, 
AND HAWK, ISAACSON, JOHNSON, 
KENNEDY, KYLE, LANGFORD, LEE, 
JOE MANCHIN, McCONNELL, PAUL, 
PERDUE, PORTMAN, RICH, ROBERTS, 
ROUNDS, RADIO, SAX, SCOTT, 
SHELBY, SULLIVAN, KUHN, TILLIS, 
COONEY, WICKER, YOUNG.
>> SENATORS VOTING IN THE 
NEGATIVE. 
BALDWIN, BENNETT, BLUMENTHAL, 
BOOKER, BROWN, CANTWELL, 
CARDEN, CASEY, KOONS, CORTEZ 
MASTRO, DONNELLY, DUCKWORTH, 
DURBIN, FEINSTEIN, JILL A 
BRAND, HARRIS, HASSAN, 
HEINRICH, HITE CAMP, HER 
ROANOKE, JONES, KEYNES, KING, 
CLOVER CHAR, LEAHY, MARQUIS, 
McCASKILL, MENENDEZ, MERKLEY, 
MURRAY, NELSON, PETERS, REID, 
SANDERS, SHOTS, SCHUMER, SHAHEEN
, SMITH, STEVAN AL, TESTER, 
UDALL, VAN HOLLEN, WARNER, 
WARREN, WHITE HOUSE, WIDEN. 
>> MR. MURPHY. 
NO.
>> AS WE WATCH THE FINAL VOTE 
IN THE SENATE FOR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH TO MAKE IT TO THE 
SUPREME COURT, I WILL BRING CBS 
CONTRIBUTOR, MOLLY COOPER WHO 
HAS COVERED THIS. 
AS WE ARE WATCHING THE VOTES 
COME DOWN AS WE EXPECTED, RIGHT 
DOWN PARTY LINES, I'M CURIOUS 
ABOUT REPUBLICANS THAT STOOD BY 
THEIR PARTY LINE, THERE WERE A 
COUPLE STATES IN PARTICULAR, 
THINKING OF COLORADO AND NEVADA 
WHERE YOU'RE SEEING SENATOR 
GARDNER, SENATOR HELLER, THESE 
WERE STATES HILLARY CLINTON WON 
LAST GO-ROUND, HOW ARE 
DEMOCRATS NOT ABLE TO PICK OFF 
MORE REPUBLICANS ON THIS? 
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE JUDGE AND 
SEND TO BE JUSTICE AS SOON AS 
THE GAVEL GOES DOWN IN THE 
VOTE, HAS STOOD FOR AND THE 
RULINGS HE HAS MADE, THESE ARE 
INDIVIDUALS, CORY GARDNER AND 
DEAN HELLER, WHO WOULD SUPPORT 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEY 
WOULD SUPPORT THIS VOTE, UNLIKE 
SUSAN COLLINS, MORE QUESTIONS 
REGARDING ROE V WADE AND THE 
HEALTHCARE DECISIONS, THESE ARE 
MORE CONSERVATIVE SENATORS, 
CORY GARDNER IN COLORADO. 
CORY GARDNER PLAYED AN 
INTERESTING ROLE, HE IS THE 
HEAD OF THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN 
SENATORIAL COMMITTEE. 
HE NEEDS TO FOLLOW WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS PUTTING OUT THERE, 
IN TERMS OF HIS NOMINEE. 
>> WALK US THROUGH THIS RIGHT 
NOW, WE HEARD VOTES IN THE 
AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE, ALL 
DOWN PARTY LINES EXPECTED, 
WHERE DOES THIS GO AS FAR AS 
PROCEDURES? 
>> ASIDE FROM JOE MANCHIN, WHO 
SUPPORTS KAVANAUGH IN WEST 
VIRGINIA, AND LISA MURKOWSKI, 
WHO OPTED TO VOTE PRESENT LAST 
NIGHT SHE WOULD VOTE NO. 
SHE WOULD CHANGE HER VOTE TO 
PRESENT ESSENTIALLY TO CANCEL A 
YES VOTE OF STEVE DAINES THAT 
COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE 
HIS DAUGHTER IS GETTING 
MARRIED, HE WANTED TO BE THERE 
TO WALK DOWN THE AISLE. 
IT IS LARGELY PARTISAN WIDE. 
WE WILL HAVE A CONFIRMED 
ASSOCIATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
FROM THERE, WE WILL GO THROUGH 
THE REGULAR PROCESS, ALL THE 
POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE THAT 
COMES WITH THAT. 
THE PRESIDENT USUALLY BRINGS 
THE JUSTICE IN, THEY TAKE THE 
OATH, THERE WILL BE PICTURES OF 
THE SUPREME COURT AS KAVANAUGH 
IS ELEVATED TO THAT ROLE. 
THEN WE GO FROM THERE. 
AFTER THIS VOTE, THAT'S IT. 
THE SENATE IS OUT OF IT. 
I BELIEVE SENATOR MITCH 
McCONNELL PLANS TO HAVE A PRESS 
CONFERENCE IMMEDIATELY 
FOLLOWING. 
ONE ITEM TO NOTE, THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE'S ROLE IN 
INVESTIGATING THE ALLEGATION OF 
DOCTOR LACEY FOR -- CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD. 
THEY MAY PURSUE MORE ON HOW HER 
NAME WAS LEAKED. 
I UNDERSTAND CHUCK GRASSLEY AND 
HIS STAFF ARE TRYING TO GET P --
PIECES AFFORD -- EVIDENCE THEY 
RELIED ON. 
WHETHER HE WILL BE NOMINATED TO 
THE SUPREME COURT BENCH. 
>> I WILL BRING IN MICHAEL 
GRAHAM WHO JOINS US NOW. 
IF WE CAN GO TO THE WIDER SHOT 
EARLIER AT THE SENATE FLOOR, 
THERE WAS AN IMAGE THAT CAUGHT 
MY EYE. 
IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO BRING IT 
DOWN, SEATED DOWN IN FRONT. 
WE DO NOT HAVE DAMAGE, SEATED 
WHERE THE SENATE PAGE IS, MAYBE 
HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE AGE AT 
THIS POINT, I'M REMINDED OF THE 
ANITA HILL HEARINGS, I WAS AN 
ELEMENTARY AGE STUDENT AT THE 
TIME, I THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT 
IT HAD IN MY LIFETIME OF THAT 
DECISION. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS 
YOUNGER GENERATION THAT IS 
WATCHING THIS, MIGHT NOT BE 
ABLE TO VOTE AT THIS POINT. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THEM? 
>> MY 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER 
ASKED ME WHEN THE ALLEGATIONS 
CAME OUT, SHE SAID, DADDY, WHY 
WON'T HE JUST SAY HE DID IT? 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? 
I THINK IT IS MEAN OF HIM TO 
SAY HE DID NOT DO IT. 
WHAT IF HE DIDN'T DO IT? 
HE IS TELLING WHAT HE BELIEVES 
TO BE TRUE. 
SHE HAD BEEN SO CONVINCED 
BECAUSE OF THE CONVERSATION. 
>> MICHAEL, I APOLOGIZE, I WILL 
INTERRUPT YOU. 
WE WILL LISTEN TO VICE 
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. 
>> THE NOMINATION OF BRETT 
KAVANAUGH OF MARYLAND TO BE AN 
ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED 
STATES IS CONFIRMED. 
>> MAJORITY LEADER. 
>> I ASK THE RECONSIDER BE MADE 
IMMEDIATELY AND THE PRESIDENT 
NOTIFY.
>> SERGEANT AT ARMS WILL 
RESTORE ORDER IN THE GALLERY. 
THE CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL. 
>> MR. ALEXANDER.
>>> THERE YOU HAVE IT, 
OFFICIALLY 50-48, SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN 
VOTED IN BY THE SUPREME COURT, 
MAKING IT THE MOST CONSERVATIVE 
MAJORITY EVER. 
I WILL BRING IN THE CBSN PANEL 
JOINING US, LESLIE SANCHEZ, I 
GO TO YOU RIGHT NOW, WHAT DOES 
THIS MEAN FOR THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY? 
>> HAVING A CONSERVATIVE 
JURIST, IT IS A STRONG WIN. 
THIS IS BEEN SOMETHING 
IMPORTANT TO REPUBLICANS FOR A 
VARIETY OF REASONS, HE 
DELIVERED ON THAT NOT ONCE BUT 
TWICE. 
YOU LOOK AT THE TWEETS, IT HAS 
ALSO GALVANIZED CONSERVATIVE 
WOMEN, ON AN ISSUE THEY COULD 
RALLY AROUND, THE APPENDED -- 
INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM HAS 
BEEN TALKING TO SENATOR FLAKE 
AND SENATOR COLLINS, JOE 
MANCHIN, THE UNDECIDED, TO 
THANK THEM FOR FOLLOWING WITH 
DUE PROCESS, NOT LOOKING AT HOW 
LITTLE SIZED THIS WAS AND 
MOVING FORWARD. 
CREDIT SHOULD GO TO LISA 
MURKOWSKI, NOBODY IS TALKING 
ABOUT THAT, SHE MADE A TOUGH 
CHOICE AGAINST HER PARTY LINE. 
BECAUSE SHE FELT IN HER GUT AND 
OTHER SENATORS, THERE IS GOING 
TO BE A CLOUD AND HE WAS NOT 
THE RIGHT NOMINEE AT THE RIGHT 
TIME. 
FOR REPUBLICANS, IT'S A WIN. 
THAT CLOUD WILL CONTINUE TO 
REMAIN. 
>> LINDA TRAN, WHERE THE 
DEMOCRATS GO ? 
>> DEMOCRATS WILL RALLY THE 
TROOPS, WE SAW MANY PROTESTS 
THAT WERE EXTRAORDINARY AND 
ORGANIC, PEOPLE COMING FROM 
AROUND THE COUNTRY TRYING TO 
MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD. 
I WONDER HOW IT WILL HAVE A 
CHILLING EFFECT ON PEOPLE 
COMING FORWARD TO SHARE THEIR 
STORIES OF SURVIVAL. 
WE SAW A VIDEO YESTERDAY THAT 
WENT VIRAL OF A YOUNG WOMAN, 15-
YEAR-OLD GIRL, CONSTITUENT OF 
JOE MANCHIN, THAT CAME TO 
WASHINGTON DC WITH HER MOTHER 
TO SHARE HER STORY OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULTS. 
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THESE 
INDIVIDUALS AND THE IMPACT IT 
HAS ON THEM THAT THEIR VOICES 
DID NOT MATTER AND THEIR 
STORIES WERE NOT HURT. 
AS DEMOCRATS GOING TO THE 
ELECTION, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO 
GRAPPLE WITH THAT LEVEL OF RAGE 
AND TRY TO CHANNEL THAT INTO A 
SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT ABOUT WHAT 
CAN BE DONE ABOUT HOW CHANGE 
CAN BE MADE THROUGH THE BALLOT 
BOX. 
>> HE HAS BEEN LINKED TO THE ME 
TO MOVEMENT, A STORY ABOUT 
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL 
ABUSE. 
WHAT DO WE SAY TO WOMEN THAT 
FEEL LIKE THEIR VOICES WILL 
ONLY BE SILENCED? 
>> I THINK THE THING TO SAY, IF 
YOU WANT TO SEE HOW SOMEBODY 
CAN BE HEARD, LOOK HOW DOCTOR 
FORD WAS TREATED BY THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, THEY 
LISTENED AND GAVE HER THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO TELL HER STORY. 
THERE WERE NOT PEOPLE YELLING 
AT HER FROM THE BENCH. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT GET THE 
MEMO, APPARENTLY. 
THE JUDICIARY SENATE COMMITTEE 
CANNOT BE CRITICIZED HOW THEY 
TREATED DOCTOR FORD, THEY MADE 
THE CASE, I THOUGHT SUSAN 
COLLINS WAS POWERFUL IN THIS 
YESTERDAY WHEN SHE CALLED OUT 
WHATEVER DEMOCRATIC STAFFER 
LEAKED THE LETTER FROM DOCTOR 
FORD AND FORCED HER INTO THE 
LIMELIGHT. 
THAT STORYLINE IS LOST RIGHT 
NOW, PEOPLE ARE TOO EMOTIONAL, 
THIS IS COMPLETELY PARTISAN. 
GOING BACK, REPUBLICANS CAN SAY 
WE HAVE NOT SAID, DON'T SPEAK. 
WHEN YOU SPEAK, WE HAVE TO 
TREAT EVERYONE FAIRLY. 
SUSAN COLLINS WAS A TREMENDOUS 
VOICE FOR THAT ARGUMENT IN HER 
SPEECH YESTERDAY. 
I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST 
POLITICAL SPEECHES, MECHANICAL 
STANDPOINT OF ACCOMPLISHING 
WHAT SHE WANTED TO DO I HAVE 
EVER SEEN. 
I USED TO WRITE SPEECHES FOR 
CANDIDATES, PEOPLE WOULD 
COMPLAIN IT WAS TOO LONG, I 
THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIFIC. 
IT GIVES REPUBLICANS A 
GUIDELINE FOR PASSPORT, BE 
COMPASSIONATE, BE OPEN AND FAIR,
DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR BEING FAIR. 
WE ARE ALL GROWN-UPS, THERE ARE 
TOUGH ISSUES AND SOMETIMES 
THERE ARE HE SAID, SHE SAID 
MOMENTS, THERE'S NO REASON TO 
BE JUVENILE AT ANY LEVEL, FROM 
DISMISSING THE WOMAN OR ALSO 
SAYING ALL WOMEN SHOULD BE 
BELIEVED. 
NEITHER POSITIONS ARE 
LEGITIMATE OR CREDIBLE, THAT'S 
A PATH FORWARD SUSAN COLLINS 
LAID OUT YESTERDAY. 
>> SHE WENT POINT BY POINT, 
TALKING ABOUT ROE V WADE AND 
JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT, IT WAS A 
45 MINUTE SPEECH. 
MICHAEL, WHAT IS THE MESSAGE TO 
MEN WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL 
ASSAULT WITH THIS? 
WE KNOW JUDGE KAVANAUGH FOUGHT 
THIS AGGRESSIVELY, FIERCELY AND 
HE CAME OUT STRONG. 
IS THE MESSAGE FIGHT IT, YOU 
WILL SURVIVE? 
>> THIS IS SUCH AN UNUSUAL 
CIRCUMSTANCE. 
WE ARE BETTER AT ADJUDICATING 
CASES WHERE IT IS A HE SAID, 
SHE SAID, THERE WAS AN 
ENCOUNTER, BOTH PEOPLE HAVE A 
DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE 
ENCOUNTER. 
SOMEBODY SAID IT ABSOLUTELY 
HAPPENED, 100% SURE IT IS JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
KAVANAUGH SAID I'M ABSOLUTELY 
SURE IT WAS NOT ME, THERE WAS NO
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE, YOU 
COULD NOT GO TO A SINGLE 
WITNESS THAT COULD CONFIRM OR 
BACKUP DOCTOR FORD'S STORY. 
YOU WERE LEFT IN A POLARIZED 
AREA. 
IT WAS LIKE POLITICS. 
IF YOUR MAN AND YOU'RE LOOKING 
FOR SOMEONE TO RALLY AROUND YOU 
BECAUSE YOU ARE AN ABUSIVE JERK 
AND PEOPLE ARE OKAY WITH THAT, 
THIS CASE DID NOT WORK FOR YOU 
IN THIS MESSAGE. 
IT REMINDS PEOPLE, NUMBER ONE, 
TAKE THE ACCUSATION SERIOUSLY. 
NUMBER TWO, IF YOU'RE A WOMAN, 
PEOPLE ARE READY TO LISTEN, 
BRING YOUR EVIDENCE WHEN IT 
HAPPENS SO PEOPLE CAN STAND 
AROUND YOU. 
IT IS UNFAIR ARGUMENT FROM 
DEMOCRATS THAT SOMEHOW WOMEN 
HAVE BEEN DISMISSED IN THIS 
PROCESS. 
IT WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR 
SOMEONE TO SHOW ME EVIDENCE TO 
BACK UP THAT CASE ABOUT THIS 
SPECIFIC STORY OF DOCTOR FORD 
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
>> I WILL BRING MOLLY HOOPER ON 
CAPITOL HILL. 
YOU MENTIONED THE PROCEDURES 
GOING FORWARD, WE ASK  WRECKED 
-- EXPECT A PRESS CONFERENCE 
FROM MITCH COLLINS. 
>> AFTER THE THURSDAY HEARING, 
I WAS IN THE HOUSE SIDE, 
RUNNING INTO SOME OF MY 
SOURCES, ANTI-TRUMP, PRO-TRUMP, 
THE ONE THING THAT UNITED THEM 
WAS KAVANAUGH WAS TREATED 
UNFAIRLY, THEY BROUGHT UP A LOT 
OF POINTS I WOULD NOT HAVE 
ANTICIPATED. THIS ONE ISSUE, IF 
ANYTHING UNIFIED REPUBLICANS, 
LINDSEY GRAHAM, OF ALL PEOPLE, 
ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF 
CRITICS, SAID THIS ISSUE HAS 
UNIFIED REPUBLICANS MORE THAN 
ANY SINCE TRUMP HAS BEEN 
PRESIDENT. 
IT'S NOT HE SAID, SHE SAID, 
IT'S THE WAY JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
HAS BEEN TREATED, THE WAY BOTH 
DOCTOR FORD AND KAVANAUGH HAVE 
BEEN TREATED IN THIS PROCESS. 
MITCH McCONNELL SAID EARLIER, 
IT IS A SHOT OF ADRENALINE FOR 
US, EXPECT REPUBLICANS TO KEEP 
THIS ISSUE OUT THERE, CALLING 
THIS A "SHAMELESS SMEAR 
CAMPAIGN BY DEMOCRATS". 
IT WILL RAMP UP REPUBLICANS, IT 
ARTIE IS FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU, 
MOLLY AND MICHAEL GRAHAM, HE 
HAS TO GO OUT. 
LINDA AND LESLIE, WEIGH IN ON 
WHAT MICHAEL GRAHAM SAID 
EARLIER. 
>> LET ME SAY, I THINK MICHAEL 
GRAHAM IS A VERY INTELLIGENT 
HUMAN BEING, I ENJOY HAVING 
THESE CONVERSATIONS, I HAVE 
NEVER TAKEN MORE ISSUE WITH ANY 
COMMENTARY HE HAS OFFERED MORE 
THAN IN THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT. 
THE IDEA OF LIKENING SOMEONE 
THAT SUFFERED SEXUAL ASSAULT 
WITH THE ACCUSED AS BOTH 
VICTIMS, SHOWS YOU HOW UNFAIR 
THIS ENTIRE SITUATION HAS BEEN. 
IT'S NOT HE SAID, SHE SAID. 
YOU CAN'T SAY YOU BELIEVE 
DOCTOR CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD 
AND IN THE NEXT BREATH SAY, SHE 
IS CONFUSED. 
YOU BELIEVE HER OR YOU DON'T. 
WHEN SHE SAID SHE WAS 100% 
CERTAIN IT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH 
THAT ASSAULTED HER, THAT 
SHOULD'VE MEANT SOMETHING. 
EVEN THE WAY THAT HEARING WAS 
CARRIED OUT, THE FACT THEY HAD 
TO BRING IN A FEMALE PROSECUTOR 
THEY REFER TO AS A FEMALE 
ASSISTANT, THEY WERE NOT BRAVE 
ENOUGH TO CONFRONT AND SPEAK TO 
HER THEMSELVES. 
THAT MEANS ALL OF THE MEN, THE 
GOP MEN SITTING ON THE 
COMMITTEE, THAT TELLS YOU THEY 
WERE VERY WORRIED AND WANTED TO 
SET THIS UP SO IT WAS APPEALING 
TO THEM. 
WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE 
THEY CALLED FOR A FBI 
INVESTIGATION THAT DID NOT 
QUESTION THE ACCUSER OR THE 
ACCUSED, YOU HEAR ALL OF THE 
STORIES, TESTIMONY OFFERED 
WITHIN THE LAST 24 HOURS FROM A 
FRIEND OF CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD 
WHO SAID HE HAD SPOKEN TO HER 
IN 2016. 
SHE TOLD HIM ABOUT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH BY NAME AT THE TIME. 
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE COMING 
FORD, THEY TRIED TO REACH OUT 
TO THE FBI, THEIR INFORMATION 
AND EVIDENCE WAS NOT TAKEN INTO 
ACCOUNT. 
THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD 
POSSIBLY LEAVE THE WAY THE 
INVESTIGATION OR THE HEARING 
WAS CARRIED OUT WAS FAIR TO 
DOCTOR FORD. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU HAD 
A WOMAN ACCUSED, HER LIFE WAS 
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BECAUSE OF 
THE EXPERIENCE SHE HAD. 
SHE IS -- SHE IS LEFT WITH THAT 
FOR DECADES . SHE CANNOT LIVE 
IN HER OWN HOME, HER NAME IS 
OUT THERE AND SHE IS A PIECE OF 
HISTORY SHE DOES NOT WANT TO BE 
PART OF. 
YOU HAVE A GUY THAT WILL BE ON 
THE SUPREME COURT, SOMEBODY, 
EVEN IF YOU SET ASIDE WHETHER 
OR NOT YOU BELIEVE CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD, EXHIBIT A 
TEMPERAMENT IN BEFITTING OF A 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE IT IS 
DETRIMENTAL TO THE NATION AT 
LARGE. 
IT IS A HORRIBLE MOMENT FOR 
EVERY AMERICAN IN THIS COUNTRY, 
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 
PARTY. 
>> LESLIE, TO LINDA'S POINT, 
MANY WOMEN FELT LIKE THIS WAS A 
MOMENT WE HOPED WOULD LEAD TO 
SOMETHING MORE AND IT DIDN'T. 
MICHAEL HAD TO LEAVE. 
MICHAEL'S POINT WAS ALSO, IN 
THIS SYSTEM, WE ALLOWED HER TO 
BE HURT. 
YOU MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH THE 
FBI INVESTIGATION, SHE WAS 
ALLOWED IN A PUBLIC HIGHLY RATED
, MANY PEOPLE TUNED IN TO WATCH 
THE TESTIMONIUM BOTH SIDES. 
HOW DO WE MOVE PAST THIS IN 
SEXUAL ASSAULT LIKE THE IT IS 
HE SAID VERSUS SHE SAID WITH 
LITTLE EVIDENCE OR INFORMATION 
TO CORROBORATE EITHER SIDE. 
>> TO CORROBORATE WHAT SHE 
SAID, YES. 
THERE'S SO MUCH OF THAT WE 
AGREE ON, NOT AS WOMEN OR 
POLITICAL OPERATIVES, 
FUNDAMENTALLY, IN FAIRNESS. 
FAIRNESS IS THE BIG ISSUE. 
WAS IT FAIR TO BRING DOCTOR FORD
, IT WAS APPROPRIATE. 
WAS IT FAIR TO CALL HER THE 
FEMALE'S INITIAL PROSECUTOR, 
SHE'S THE PROSECUTOR. 
WE COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT 
THESE FLIGHTS AND WHAT THE 
JUDICIARY HAD TO DO. 
YES, THE PROBLEM IS, I WILL SAY 
POLITICALLY, THE DEMOCRATS 
OVERPLAYED THIS ACCUSATION AND 
THEY PILED ON, YOU HAD ALL 
THESE OTHER ACCUSATIONS, SOME 
OF THEM OUTLANDISH, IT SOUNDED 
LIKE YOU WERE BULLYING AND 
PILING ON BRETT KAVANAUGH, 
THAT'S WHAT ACTIVATED 
CONSERVATIVE WOMEN, THE WAY YOU 
HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE EQUAL RIGHTS
AMENDMENT, THE CIVIL RIGHTS 
MOVEMENT, IT CREATED A 
CONSERVATIVE WOMEN'S COALITION, 
A MOVEMENT FOR US. 
THAT'S WHAT THIS DID. 
THE PROBLEM IS, WE WESTERNIZED 
SEXUAL ASSAULT IN A WAY TO SUIT 
OUR OWN MEANS. 
THE PRESIDENT DID THAT WHEN HE 
WAS MOCKING DOCTOR FORD AT A 
POLITICAL RALLY. 
IT MINIMIZES AND TRIVIALIZES úW 
TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT 
CONVERSATION ABOUT. 
THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO SEE THE 
SENATE GO, YOU WILL SEE IT WITH 
MORE WOMEN ELECTED, REGARDLESS 
OF PARTY. 
WOMEN ARE KNOWN AS ELECTED 
OFFICIALS, TO BE PEOPLE TO 
REACH ACROSS THE AISLE, LOOK 
FOR DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES, 
LOOK AT COLLINS AND SENATOR 
MURKOWSKI. 
THEY HAD DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS 
AND CONSTITUENCIES, THEY'RE 
WILLING TO TAKE THE BULLET, 
BACKING THEIR PARTY OR 
CHALLENGING, FALLING IN LINE 
WITH LEADERSHIP. 
THAT'S WHERE THIS WILL GO. 
THE RIPPLE EFFECT FOR YOUNG 
GIRLS, CANDIDATES AND PARTIES 
WILL BE HELD FOR A GENERATION. 
>> I HAVE A FEELING WE WILL ALL 
BE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN THIS 
CHANNEL FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS TO 
COME. 
>> FOR GENERATIONS. 
>> I DON'T THINK I CAN SIT IN 
THE SEAT FOR A GENERATION. 
LESLIE SANCHEZ AND LINDA TRAN, 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.  
BRETT KAVANAUGH OFFICIALLY 
ANNOUNCED IN THE SENATE AS THE 
NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, 
MAKING HIM THE 114th JUSTICE 
WITH THE CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY, 
HE ASCENDS TO THE NATION'S 
HIGHEST COURT. 
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, A GOP PRESS 
CONFERENCE, LEADERSHIP 
CONFERENCE WE ARE EXPECTING 
CONFIRMING JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. 
MORE COMING UP. 
STICK WITH US IN CBSN.
