1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,680
- It's all-you-can-eat
pancake time at IHOP.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,918
- Endless shrimp is back at Red Lobster.

3
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:08,539
- all-you-can-eat of this for $6.99?

4
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:11,040
- [Narrator] Unlimited food.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,750
These restaurants give you all-you-can-eat

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,429
for one fixed price.

7
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,034
Sounds like a pretty good deal,

8
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:20,701
but how do these
restaurants make any money?

9
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:26,038
The way buffets typically work
is each person pays the same

10
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:30,060
fixed price for access to a
line of self-serve dishes.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,849
You grab a plate, fill it
with food, eat, and repeat.

12
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:36,411
As many times as you want.

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,851
- This started in the 70s and the 80s,

14
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:42,123
and they were very popular.

15
00:00:42,123 --> 00:00:44,185
I think it was kind of sign-of-the-time.

16
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:46,504
They were a family style restaurant,

17
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,642
they did not serve alcohol,

18
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:52,793
but it was a lot of food
for not a lot of money.

19
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:55,152
- [Narrator] Popular chain
restaurants that use this model

20
00:00:55,152 --> 00:00:58,414
are Golden Corral, and Home Town Buffet.

21
00:00:58,414 --> 00:01:00,375
Other all-you-can-eat
buffets specialize in

22
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:03,675
one type of cuisine, like
Chinese food, Indian food,

23
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:05,703
or different types of pizza.

24
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:08,374
The most obvious money saver
for a buffet restaurant

25
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:10,473
is there's less need for servers.

26
00:01:10,473 --> 00:01:13,606
- They don't need full
wait staff because you're

27
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:17,431
getting your own food and
bringing it to the table.

28
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:19,803
- [Narrator] But these
restaurants apply another strategy

29
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:21,767
that's hidden in plain sight.

30
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:24,642
Pay attention to the
layout of a buffet line.

31
00:01:24,642 --> 00:01:28,022
Buffets often put cheaper,
or more filling carbs

32
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:29,458
towards the beginning of the line.

33
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:33,136
- They would have a lot
more menu items that had

34
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,543
good profit margins on them.

35
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:39,989
Then all of the sides and the
carbs came before the entree

36
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:42,328
so that by the time you got your entree,

37
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:43,886
your plate was full.

38
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,698
- [Narrator] And to try
and stop people from taking

39
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:48,077
more than they can eat, these
restaurants might provide

40
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:50,088
smaller than average dinner plates.

41
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:53,998
Or really big soft-drink cups,
so you can fill up on soda.

42
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:55,092
But that doesn't always stop people

43
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,071
from piling it up vertically.

44
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:59,017
Or going back for another plate

45
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:00,948
- [Garfield] This will be as an appetizer.

46
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:03,968
- [Narrator] So some buffets
may cut corners in other ways

47
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:06,282
to make sure they aren't
losing a bunch of money.

48
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:10,663
- Because of the tight profit
margins, the food quality

49
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:14,203
wasn't as great as it
probably should have been

50
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:15,592
or could have been.

51
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:18,331
- [Narrator] Riggs says this
contributed to their decline.

52
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:22,072
Between 1998 and 2017, the
number of all-you-can-eat buffets

53
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:24,392
dropped by 26 percent.

54
00:02:24,392 --> 00:02:26,649
Even though the number
of restaurants overall

55
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:28,232
rose by 22 percent.

56
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:32,171
Part of the reason for
the decline in buffets,

57
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:34,315
was the expansion of
casual dining restaurants

58
00:02:34,315 --> 00:02:37,715
like Applebee's, TGI
Fridays, Olive Garden,

59
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:40,056
and Outback Steakhouse.

60
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:42,565
This is the type of restaurant
that typically offers

61
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:44,863
all-you-can-eat specials
on particular items.

62
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:47,936
- For example, you take Red Lobster,

63
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,627
they will have their
all-you-can-eat shrimp.

64
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:54,027
They're not inexpensive
and consumers like those

65
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:57,409
and they think they're getting
a good value for the money.

66
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:59,197
They're around for about six weeks,

67
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:02,128
so there's a sense of
urgency that's created.

68
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:04,757
- [Announcer] But hurry, endless
shrimp won't be here long.

69
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:08,999
- The hope is that once consumers
get inside the restaurant,

70
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:11,440
they will add more things,

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,018
they'll try, they'll be
satisfied, and will return.

72
00:03:16,018 --> 00:03:18,760
Because the only way you're
going to drive your business

73
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,530
in the restaurant industry today

74
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,222
is through building loyalty.

75
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:24,398
- [Narrator] With just a few tricks,

76
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:27,614
like using smaller plates,
putting cheap items

77
00:03:27,614 --> 00:03:31,689
towards the front, and using
drinks to off-set other costs,

78
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,557
all-you-can-eat restaurants
are able to accomplish

79
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:36,117
the same goal as any other restaurant.

80
00:03:36,117 --> 00:00:00,000
Get people in the door.
