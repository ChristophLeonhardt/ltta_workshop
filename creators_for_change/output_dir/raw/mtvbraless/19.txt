1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,135
- Let's play a little game.

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,770
Who do you think is
more of a real man,

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,438
Harry Styles or Vin Diesel?

4
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:07,073
LeBron James or Bruno Mars?

5
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:09,843
What about Hugh Jackman
singing and dancing in Les Mis,

6
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,245
versus Hugh Jackman
as Wolverine?

7
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:15,148
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,450
Now while you may have your
own personal preferences,

9
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,886
if you answered Vin,
LeBron, or Wolverine,

10
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,988
most people wouldn't give
you much of an argument.

11
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,356
So, does that mean Harry, Bruno,

12
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,559
and singing and dancing
Hugh aren't real men?

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,661
Well no, the problem
is the question

14
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,130
doesn't actually make sense,

15
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,066
and yet society keeps
asking what's a real man?

16
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:37,437
A lot, like 49 million
plus Google results a lot.

17
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,506
And that's probably because
from the very beginning,

18
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,141
meaning like the
moment we're born,

19
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,910
society encourages us
to think that real men

20
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,612
have a finite set of traits.

21
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,047
What are those traits?

22
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,983
Well, there are so many
articles and listicles out there

23
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,752
trying to tell everyone
what real men do or don't do

24
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,654
that I recruited a few
good men to go through

25
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:55,989
some of our favorites.

26
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,290
Fellows.

27
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,925
- All right, so a lot of
these fall into the line

28
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,794
of the classic manly
man stereotypes

29
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,829
like real men don't cry,

30
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,399
real men eat red meat, and
real men drive stick-shifts.

31
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,669
And apparently only real
men appreciate Gladiator.

32
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,072
- And then, there are the
people who list out generically

33
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,107
positive traits that a real
man is supposed to have

34
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,976
like a real man is cool,
calm, and collected.

35
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,678
A real man has courage.

36
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,247
A real man is physically
strong and can defend himself.

37
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,150
And confusingly, real men
are not lovers or fighters,

38
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,686
they're both simultaneously.

39
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,289
- Lastly, real men are defined
by how they treat women.

40
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,724
Like a real man never
leads a woman on,

41
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,194
and real men have enough
willpower to keep it

42
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,695
in their pants.

43
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,263
Of course, other people
say that real men hook up

44
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,700
with as many women as
possible, so that seems odd.

45
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,968
- Okay, you got that?

46
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,736
All you have to do to
be a real man is follow

47
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,439
an impossibly long list
of contradictory advice.

48
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,675
But if you take a look, there
are some reoccurring themes

49
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,676
you may notice.

50
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,944
Gentlemen.

51
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,112
- Well, a lot of times
they're just trying

52
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,646
to get you to buy stuff.

53
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,181
That's why you see things
like real men eat steak

54
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,916
or real men drive stick-shift.

55
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,818
They're basically saying
if you're a vegetarian

56
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,187
with an automatic, you clearly
don't produce testosterone

57
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,922
and have brought
shame to your family.

58
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,524
- Another group is
trying to convince you

59
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,426
that a vague series of
traits that could belong

60
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,661
to a person of any gender,
like being courageous,

61
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,263
being physically strong,

62
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,165
or being a leader are
somehow masculine traits

63
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,633
rather than gender neutral.

64
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,401
Also, if you're a man who
doesn't possess these traits,

65
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,836
you should feel ashamed.

66
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,771
- This last group, by focusing
on a man's relationship

67
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,975
to a woman, is implicitly
saying that gay and bisexual men

68
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,209
aren't real men.

69
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,677
This is called
heteronormativity,

70
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,079
and these definitions imply

71
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,547
that if you like
kissing other men,

72
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,150
then you just can't be a real
man which is just (bleep).

73
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,018
- Also, what's not
said in these articles

74
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,187
is that the real man myth
essentially discourages

75
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,955
traditionally feminine traits.

76
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,324
I mean, when's the last
time you heard one of these?

77
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,994
- Real men cry at movies,
because real men know

78
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,763
emotional expression
is normal and healthy.

79
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,199
- Real men take care of
children because real men

80
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,101
know how to be
gentle and nurturing.

81
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,203
- Real men focus on the
arts because real men

82
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,539
respect their own desire
for quiet introspection.

83
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,541
Woo, make that painting!

84
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,543
- And our obsession with
the rigid masculinity,

85
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,111
which teaches boys to suppress

86
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,346
their emotions, actually kills.

87
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,782
A 2016 study found that
men who try to conform

88
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,885
to traditional standards of
masculinity are more likely

89
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,488
to deal with depression and
less likely to seek help.

90
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,758
As a result, men are almost
four times more likely to die

91
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,459
from suicide than women.

92
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,895
The real man myth also
feeds into rape culture,

93
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,730
transphobia, and homophobia,

94
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,532
meaning it's not
good for any of us.

95
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,768
- Hey, you know what will
make you a real man, bro?

96
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,603
- Off the top of my head, and
I'm just spit balling here,

97
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,239
sexually objectifying women
and revolving your identity

98
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,740
around how much
sex you're having,

99
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,908
who you're having it with.

100
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,143
- You know it bro.

101
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,077
- Yeah, schmoody.
- Yeah, get it.

102
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,812
- Look, here's the truth.

103
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,548
- Guys who aren't big
and bulky, real men.

104
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,917
- Guys who like
other guys, real men.

105
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,053
- Trans guys, we're real men.

106
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,654
- At the end of the
day, none of the traits

107
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,990
we listed here are
inherent to men,

108
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,491
or women for that matter.

109
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,794
They're merely traits that
some men happen to have,

110
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,796
but some don't, and that's okay.

111
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,698
There are so many
ways to be a man,

112
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,199
and none of them are wrong,

113
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,134
unless you're just
a complete (bleep).

114
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,370
Thanks for watching and
special thanks to our guests

115
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,773
Banari Poulton, Tiq Milan,
and Evan Hoyt Thompson.

116
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,209
Last week in our trans
tropes episode we flubbed

117
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,411
one of our definitions and
we wanted to clear it up.

118
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,181
So cisgender is someone
whose gender identity

119
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,583
matches the one they
were assigned at birth.

120
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,118
Thanks to everyone
who caught this error

121
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,453
and gave us a heads up.

122
00:04:13,453 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll see you next time
right here on Decoded.
