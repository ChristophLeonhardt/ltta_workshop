DECISIONS GOING FORWARD I
HOPE THEY CHOOSE CORRECTLY
TO STAND WITH US.
>> Neil: CONGRESSWOMAN THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.
SAFE TRAVELS.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Neil: DID HAVE IMPACT ON
WALL STREET INITIALLY MORE
CONFUSION.
IN THE END THE MARKETS SORT
OF SHRUGGED AND ALL RIGHT
CECE IT THING STILL GOING
ON.
INTERESTING PROXY IS THE
10-YEAR NOTE.
THAT FINISHED THE DAY AT A
HIGH.
LEVELS WE HAVE NOT SEEN
SINCE 2011.  CLOSE TO 3.10%.
AGAIN, MANY LOOK AT THAT AS
AN ACKNOWLEDGE MANY
AN ACKNOWLEDGE MANIMENT THAT
AN ACHE -- ACKNOWLEDGMENT
HERE THAT PICKING UP STEAM.
SEE THE NORTH KOREANS WALK
AWAY FROM TALKS NOT LIKELY
TO HAPPEN.
AT LEAST THAT'S THE INITIAL
READ.
FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WITH
MORE ON WHAT HAPPENED.
DEIDRE.
>> NEIL, THE CATALYST REALLY
ACCORDING TO TRAITORS I
SPOKE WITH EARLIER WAS
REALLY THAT APRIL RETAIL
SALES DATA THAT WE GOT
REALLY ON THIS MORNING WHICH
JUST SHOW THAT OUR ECONOMY
IS GOING ALONG AT A GOOD
PACE AND MORE THAN LIKELY
WILL KEEP THE FED ON PACE TO
INCREASE RATES.
SO BOND PRICES SOLD OFF WITH
STOCK WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
PUSHING 10 YEAR YIELDS TO
NEAR SEVEN YEAR HIGHS.
AS YOU WELL KNOW, MORTGAGE
RATES ARE TIED, THEY USE
THIS TENURE AS A BENCHMARK
PRICE.
SO YOU NOW HAVE MORTGAGED
DAMAGE RATES SURGING TO
HIGHEST LEVELS.
SOMETHING THAT NEW HOME
BUYERS ARE GOING TO BE
MONITORING PRETTY CLOSELY.
THAT APRIL RETAIL SALES
REPORT JUST INDICATED THIS
RISING INFLATION.
AND IF YOU PAIR THAT NEIL,
WITH WHAT WE SAW IN THE
ENERGY MARKET, RIGHT?
OIL ROSE 71.31 A BARREL.
THAT'S NEAR A THREE AND A
HALF YEAR HIGH.
THAT ALSO JUST CONTRIBUTES
TO THIS INFLATION STORY.
FIRST TIME I HAVE SEEN IT
THIS YEAR 51% CHANCE OF A
FOURTH INTEREST RATE HIKE
FROM THE FED WHEN THE
PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS OR
CONSENSUS SEEM TO BE 3.
NEXT FED MEETING IS ON
JUNE 12TH.
A LOT OF INVESTORS ARE GOING
TO BE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION
TO THAT.
SO, BIGGER PICTURE THOUGH,
INVESTORS SOMETIMES LOOK AT
THE MARKET AND SAY HEY, IF I
CAN GET 3% RETURN FROM A
BOND MARKET, WHICH IS BUYING
THIS VERY LOW RISK PRODUCT
OF U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT,
MAYBE THAT'S MORE ATTRACTIVE
TO ME IN COMPARISON TO THE
STOCK MARKET.
ESPECIALLY WHETHER YOU HAVE
SOME PEOPLE INVEST IN THE
STOCK MARKET.
WE HAVE HAD 9 YEAR BULL RUN
FOR STOCKS AT SOME POINT
THEY ARE GOING TO FALL A
LITTLE BIT.
AND THEN HAVE
AND THEN DAVE
AND THEN DOVE
AND THEN DO HAVE BONDS
BEGINNING TO LOOK A LITTLE
BIT MORE ATTRACTIVE.
TAKING A LOOK WHAT'S AHEAD,
INVESTORS, OF COURSE,
CONTINUING TO MONITOR.
YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
THESE DEVELOPING HEADLINES
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SUMMIT
OR AS THE STATEMENT
DEPARTMENT SAYS SUMMIT
BETWEEN THE U.S.
SOUTH KOREA, AND THE NORTH
KOREA AND, OF COURSE, WE ARE
STILL MONITORING TRADE.
>> YOU KNOW, CHINA AND THE
U.S. HAS BEEN DESTABILIZING
THE MARKETS OR AT LEAST
INVESTORS HAVE BEEN
DESTABILIZED BY THESE TRADE
NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON
BETWEEN THE TWO LARGEST
ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD.
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THE
U.S. ALSO LOCKED IN
NEGOTIATIONS OVER TARIFFS
WITH EUROPE AND JAPAN.
SO, NEIL, INVESTORS HAVE AN
AWFUL LOT TO MONITOR THOSE
ARE A FUTURECAST ELEMENTS
