<font color="#CCCCCC">which their conscience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to lead</font>

50
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,939
them to and and I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the fact</font>

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he was a statesman in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sense</font>

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> his opponent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that Barack Obama</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font>

56
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,590
couple of critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> moments one was when</font>

57
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that woman in the crowd said that he was</font>

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,780
possible way<font color="#E5E5E5"> of saying something and</font>

60
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,510
McCain could have said yeah I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

61
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">got along with that sort of slur</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

62
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,040
a slur to her and<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he said no no</font>

63
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,300
he's a decent man we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to</font>
