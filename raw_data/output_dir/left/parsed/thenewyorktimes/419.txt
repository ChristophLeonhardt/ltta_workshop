Yeah I miss cheeseburgers
not gonna lie.
I feel like this question was
tuned to me.
Probably the internet.
There's definitely been times 
when I felt like 
maybe I should be at home or 
maybe, this isn't the place
that I should be right now.
I know when I email my fianc√©,
we often only have a chance 
to email each other once.
So it can be really hard and
lonely sometimes to feel like
you're never really talking to
anybody you're kind of just 
two ships passing in the night,
sending letters back and forth.
But, you're never actually
having a conversation.
So in my regular life I 
live in New York.
I have a husband. I commute 
on the subway. 
I work in a cubicle. Pretty 
much every moment of my life, 
I'm surrounded by lots and 
lots of people, lots of noise.
So, yeah I do find it easier
to contemplate here.
We don't let them move on 
very long. If somebody has 
a problem with somebody else, 
we usually try to talk about it 
within an hour or two of 
whatever event set it off.
We're just very open 
with each other.
If you're talking about romance, 
I would say that I'm probably
closest with my EVA 
suit.
We get very close, we get sweaty
at least twice a week.
When we're out on EVA 
it takes my breath away.
That's why we have the big 
fans on the suits.
And that's pretty much it.
You got to remember that we
have six people living
in a confined environment,
a lot of work to get done.
And we're all professionals
from the field so, when you're
in a situation like this and 
you're trying to get a lot done,
professionalism is really
important.
And it's very important for 
keeping good crew relations.
Otherwise you'll have 
mission failure.
And that's something that 
none of us want.
I mean, yeah absolutely.
I would probably rather that
happen than my mother or 
my grandma be in the backseat.
I mean, could you imagine 
just the nagging?
Oh man, I love you guys sorry.
Probably not going to any 
Hanukkah present this year.
