00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,639
The french fry is undergoing a massive makeover.

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:08,291
Right now, there’s a race to create a new
generation of cooking and frying oils that

3
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:13,340
will replace all partially-hydrogenated oils,
or PHOs, by 2018.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,450
“But new Crisco oil splatters 40% less than
other oils.”

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,300
Partially-hydrogenated oils have been an invisible
mainstay in the American diet for decades.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,280
They're in everything: french fries, pre-packaged
dinners, all kinds of canned foods, microwaved

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,960
popcorn, and packaged baked goods that never
seem to go bad.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,920
But health researchers started to wave red
flags as study after study

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,800
pointed to the dangers of trans-fat, which
raises the risk of heart disease and stroke.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,210
Some of the research came from the food industry
itself, and it began finding ways to replace

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,340
all those PHOs.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,719
By 2015, the FDA announced that food makers
had three years to completely remove PHOs

13
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,739
from their products altogether.

14
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,159
This created a new opportunity for companies
to create an oil that is low in saturated

15
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:08,070
fat, has no trans fat, remains stable when
heated, and most importantly tastes great.

16
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,220
So we got our hands on three new oils that
claim to do just that.

17
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,250
The new oils are Dow AgroScience’s non-GMO Omega-9 canola, DuPont’s Plenish

18
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:25,390
from GMO soybeans, and Monsanto’s Vistive
Gold also from GMO soybeans all claim to taste

19
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,210
just as good—if not better, have no trans-fats,
and contain lower levels of saturated fats

20
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,549
than olive oil.

21
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,409
The manufacturers of these new oils each think
that theirs is the best tasting replacement

22
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,759
for the standard PHOs.

23
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,939
So we figured we’d test it out.

24
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,950
We asked 4 Bloomberg employees with discerning
palates

25
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,789
“I am a profound french fry enthusiast I
would say.”

26
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,640
To try 4 french fries.

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,219
3 fried in the new oils, and one fried in
trans-fat.

28
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:58,450
To see if they could spot the which oil was
trans-fat, and which—well—tasted like

29
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,170
french fries should taste.

30
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,990
“Solid crunch, good texture.”

31
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,700
“Like to me, what makes a great french fry
is a crispy, though not hard outside, and

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,130
like a lightly soft, but not too like mushy
interior.”

33
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,470
We did the same with these boxed brownies
for a baking application.

34
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,390
Same brownie mix, same eggs, 4 different oils.

35
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,910
Nobody chose the trans-fat oil as their favorite
overall.

36
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,470
“Like a potato that’s been spread with
suntan lotion.

37
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,900
That was pretty gross.”

38
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,350
“I would not be happy with this fry.”

39
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,600
For the fries, Dow’s non-GMO canola oil
was the clear winner.

40
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,700
“If you like the McDonald’s oily.”

41
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,050
“It does taste familiar, it tastes very
fast foodish.”

42
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,250
With Plenish and Vistive Gold getting positive
reactions.

43
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,370
For the brownies, there was no clear winner,
but no clear loser.

44
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,040
“Yeah, all acceptable.”

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,060
“In the brownies the difference is almost
impreceptible.”

46
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,870
While eating deep fried foods all the time
will obviously never be healthy, the clear

47
00:02:55,870 --> 00:00:00,000
winners here are consumers, who will get a
healthier option without sacrificing flavor.
