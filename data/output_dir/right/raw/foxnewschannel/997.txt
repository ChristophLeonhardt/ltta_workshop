1
00:00:02,183 --> 00:00:03,217
TO DATE.

2
00:00:03,217 --> 00:00:05,186
A BLAST THREE TIMES LARGER

3
00:00:05,186 --> 00:00:08,823
DROPPED ON JAPAN TO END WORLD

4
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:09,157
WAR II.

5
00:00:09,157 --> 00:00:10,191
>> THANK YOU.

6
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:12,627
WE HAVE WITH US NOW, DANIEL

7
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:20,668
DAVIS A FORMER ADVISER TO THE

8
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:21,869
SOUTH KOREAN ARMY.

9
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,072
HOW DO THIS THIS POWER ISSUE?

10
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:26,841
>> IN TERMS OF THIS SUSPICIOUS

11
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:30,344
OF THE MILITARY DRILLS, I DON'T

12
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:31,813
VIEW THAT AS A CONCESSION.

13
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:34,148
IT'S A CALCULATED RISK BY THE

14
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:34,515
PRESIDENT.

15
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:36,250
IT COSTS US NOTHING TO DO.

16
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,353
IT DOESN'T DIMINISH OUR MILITARY

17
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:42,023
CAPABILITY OR READINESS IN THE

18
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:42,790
SHORT TERM.

19
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,326
THERE'S NOTHING THAT WILL STOP

20
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:48,863
OUR FORCES FROM TRAINING AS YOUR

21
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:49,897
CORRESPONDENT JUST SAID.

22
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:51,966
BUT IT COULD LAY THE PATH FOR

23
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:55,636
LOWERING THE TENSIONS

24
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:56,637
CONTINUALLY AND MOVING TOWARDS

25
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:57,138
DENUCLEARIZATION.

26
00:00:57,138 --> 00:00:59,140
COULD BE A GOOD PLAY BY THE

27
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,507
PRESIDENT.

28
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:01,342
>> THERE'S A SAYING IN AMERICA,

29
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:03,211
IF YOU WANT PEACE, PREPARE FOR

30
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:03,478
WAR.

31
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:06,647
SO TO PUT A FINER POINT ON THIS,

32
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:09,183
THE BBC HAD A REPORT -- THIS IS

33
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:09,884
A TWEET.

34
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:12,019
CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY

35
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:13,287
ANNOUNCED THAT TRUMP WOULD

36
00:01:13,287 --> 00:01:14,956
SUSPEND U.S. WAR GAMES WITH

37
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:16,290
SOUTH KOREA BEFORE TRUMP

38
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,492
ANNOUNCED IT HIMSELF AT THE

39
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:19,026
PRESS BRIEFING THAT SUGGESTED

40
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:20,361
KIM'S PEOPLE WERE ON THE PHONE

41
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:21,896
TO BEIJING AFTER THE MEETING

42
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:25,366
BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE HOW BIG A

43
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:26,267
CONCESSION IT WAS.

44
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:29,103
THAT'S INTERESTING FOR ME.

45
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:30,538
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON I'VE

46
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:32,974
HEARD EXPLAIN THAT IT'S NOT AS

47
00:01:32,974 --> 00:01:34,375
BIG A CONCESSION THAT PEOPLE

48
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,009
MIGHT WORRY.

49
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:35,576
>> IT'S NOT.

50
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:37,145
THE REASON I SAY THAT, OUR

51
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,547
STRATEGIC CAPABILITIES AND OUR

52
00:01:39,547 --> 00:01:42,183
TACTICAL CAPABILITIES ARE

53
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:42,583
UNCHAFFED.

54
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,285
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WELL AWARE OF

55
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:47,755
THAT.

56
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:49,957
ANYTHING SUSPENDED CAN BE

57
00:01:49,957 --> 00:01:50,958
UNSUSPENDED IN A DAY.

58
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,894
OUR AIR FORCE IS POWERFUL, THE

59
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:53,961
PACIFIC FLEET IS CAPABLE OF

60
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,897
DOING THINGS EVERYWHERE.

61
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,198
WE HAVE GIVEN UP NOTHING.

62
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:59,133
BUT IF IT GIVES US THE

63
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:00,134
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE TOWARDS

64
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:01,969
DENUCLEARIZATION, THAT IS A

65
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:03,371
REALLY GOOD PLAY.

66
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:05,173
>> TELL ME ABOUT CYBER WARFARE.

67
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:08,074
I KNOW THE NORTH KOREANS IN

68
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:09,477
PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN VERY ADEPT

69
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:11,112
AND CAUSING LOTS OF PROBLEMS

70
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:11,712
AROUND THE WORLD.

71
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:14,215
THE CYBER WARFARE ISSUE AND OUR

72
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:15,349
PREPAREDNESS IN THAT AREA.

73
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:20,321
>> THAT IS A VERY CRITICAL ISSUE

74
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:22,123
FOR US TO TAKE CARE OF.

75
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:23,991
YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT MILITARY.

76
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:26,394
IF YOU'RE NOT PROTECTED FROM

77
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:29,664
CYBER INTRUSION, IT CAN LIMIT

78
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:32,633
YOUR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN ANY

79
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,769
REALM.

80
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:36,370
WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT.

81
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,206
OUR COUNTER MEASURES ARE

82
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:40,775
IMPROVING AND CONSTANTLY

83
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:41,142
EVOLVING.

84
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:42,677
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO PUT AN

85
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:43,177
EMPHASIS ON.

86
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:46,414
I FEEL CONFIDENT RIGHT NOW.

87
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:48,950
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE NORTH

88
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,753
KOREAN MILITARY IS THINKING NOW

89
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:54,922
ACTION THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY

90
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:58,092
WORKING FOR SOMEBODY THAT IS A

91
00:02:58,092 --> 00:02:59,760
DICTATOR AND TREATED THE

92
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,463
CITIZENS TERRIBLY BUT THEY'RE

93
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:03,898
EXTREMELY LOYAL TO HIM.

94
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:05,132
ARE THERE ANY CRACKS IN THE

95
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:06,667
ARMOR WITH HIS MILITARY?

96
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,069
>> I DON'T THINK WE SEE ANY

97
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,171
CRACKS IN THE ARMOR, NOT ON ANY

98
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:12,607
LARGE SCALE UP TO THIS POINT.

99
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:14,842
THIS SACKING OF THE THREE SENIOR

100
00:03:14,842 --> 00:03:16,177
GENERALS COULD BE AN INDICATION

101
00:03:16,177 --> 00:03:18,613
OF THAT DEPENDING WHAT THE

102
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:21,315
INSIDE REASON FOR ALL OF IT WAS.

103
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:24,318
WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF REPORTING

104
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:25,987
THAT THE MILITARY HAS BEEN

105
00:03:25,987 --> 00:03:27,455
PRIORITIZED AND THE RESOURCES

106
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:28,990
THEY'VE GOT TEN FOR DECADES NOW

107
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,925
HAS NOT BEEN AS FED AS WELL AS

108
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:36,163
WE HOPED, AS WELL AS THEY

109
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:36,497
WANTED.

110
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:37,531
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

111
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:39,267
POSSIBILITY OF LOWER TENSIONS,

112
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:40,568
THAT WILL MAKE THEM HAPPY.

113
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,336
>> I HAVE ABOUT A MINUTE LEFT

114
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:42,937
WITH YOU.

115
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:45,873
SINCE 1955 AFTER THE KOREAN WAR,

116
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:48,109
YOU KNOW, IT STARTED THAT

117
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:53,047
CURRENTLY WE HAVE 23,000 FORCES

118
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:55,516
IN SOUTH KOREA.

119
00:03:55,516 --> 00:03:58,419
I WONDER IF YOU HAVE SOME

120
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,187
THOUGHTS ABOUT THE PEOPLE, THE

121
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:02,490
AMERICANS THAT HAVE SERVED IN

122
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,225
THAT AREA SINCE 1955?

123
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:09,196
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW, WE WERE

124
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:10,898
PLACED THERE WHEN SOUTH KOREA

125
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:12,066
COULDN'T DEFEND THEMSELVES.

126
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,334
THEY RELIED ON US.

127
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:14,535
I SERVED IN THE 90s.

128
00:04:14,535 --> 00:04:15,536
EVERYBODY HAS BEEN THERE IS PART

129
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:18,372
OF DEFENDING OUR TREASURED ALLY

130
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:19,072
IN SOUTH KOREA.

131
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:20,641
THEY CAN BE PROUD OF WHAT IS

132
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:21,208
COMING IN NOW.

133
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,877
IF WE CAN GET TO THE POINT WHERE

134
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:26,047
PEACE CAN BE ACHIEVED, IT WOULD

135
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:27,948
BE A GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT.

136
00:04:27,948 --> 00:00:00,000
EVERYBODY WOULD FEEL LIKE THEY
