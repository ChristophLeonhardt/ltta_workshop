00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,360
linkedin the professional networking

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,460
website recently celebrated its 10th

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,099
anniversary with over 200 million users

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,259
worldwide it ranks only behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook</font>

5
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:18,020
and twitter in user numbers we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,180

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,690
so how what is linkedin it's a website

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,150
where you can like I look for jobs or

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,280
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people who might give you a</font>

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,070
job I think the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to describe it</font>

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,650
is a social networking site for business

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,510
professionals I have an account there

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,400
but I use it maybe you know twice a

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,110
month I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in the Dominican</font>

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,050
Republic but LinkedIn did help<font color="#CCCCCC"> me stay</font>

16
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,120
connected actually to my American people

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,770
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how many connections you</font>

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,350
have oh god I should have a lot more but

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,200
um I think I have like I must have about

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">250 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 I think I'm about 400 now i</font>

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,209
have only 106 but as littles like 100 or

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,009
less do you find that LinkedIn is

23
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:09,829
particularly helpful for your specific

24
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:13,039
industry yes we're both in advertising

25
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,899
sales so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of people in</font>

26
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:16,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">the industry on linkedin now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a</font>

27
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,689
freelance photographer I don't

28
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:19,670
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> need you know like like</font>

29
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,469
business contacts isn't kind of like

30
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:23,479
that it's also helpful to get other

31
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:25,219
names other than the names<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

32
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,350
currently have and work with unlike the

33
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">people you may know</font>

34
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,340
action and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking up a client on</font>

35
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,840
linkedin you're able to get other

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,760
members of their team to do you find

37
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,310
that it replaces the purpose of other

38
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,770
social networks like Facebook no not at

39
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,410
all actually actually I keep my profiles

40
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,659
to stink between Facebook and my

41
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:46,270
LinkedIn profiles I've not everybody is

42
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,770
like getting rid of their facebook

43
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,530
account to go join linkedin I don't know

44
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,670

45
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,350
very useful thing for me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing but</font>
