HEATHER: RED RIPTIDE THREATENING THE HOPES OF THE HEATHER: RED RIPTIDE THREATENING THE HOPES OF THE DEMOCRATIC. WAVE IN NOVEMBER. EIGHT PRIMARIES HELD ACROSS AMERICA THIS WEEK WITH MAJOR REPUBLICAN MOMENTUM BUILDING IN CALIFORNIA. JOINING ME TO REACT IS CHAIRWOMAN FOR CALIFORNIA DYLAN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I LIKE THAT. A RED RIPTIDE OR BLUE WAVE. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN? STARTING IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD A LOT OF WARNINGS FROM DEMOCRATS THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A BLUE WAVE THAT SWAMPED US. WE HAVE 7 CONGRESSIONAL RACES HERE IN DISTRICT THAT HILLARY CLINTON CARRIED AND DEMOCRATS AND NANCY PELOSI TARGETING AND HOPING FOR THOSE TO GO THEIR WAY AND THEY WENT BUST. REPUBLICANS DID VERY WELL. OUR VOTERS TURNED OUT IN GREATER NUMBERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THEN DEMOCRATS DID. THAT CARRIED OUT IN OTHER STATES AS WELL. WE HAD HIGH ENTHUSIASM AMONG REPUBLICANS COUPLED WITH AFTER MANY MONTHS OF DEMOCRATS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT BUT NOT HAVING THEIR OWN AGENDA THEIR VOTERS DIDN'T TURN OUT. IT IS LOOKING GOOD FOR US. IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE CALL THE MAIN NEWS STREAM MEDIA, THEY TALKED A LOT ABOUT DEMOCRATS TURNING OUT IN HUGE NUMBERS. DO YOU THINK THIS WILL KEEP UP WITH REPUBLICANS AS WE HEAD TOWARD THE MIDTERMS? MORE REPUBLICANS HEADING OUT AND WHY DO YOU THINK MORE REPUBLICANS ARE HEADING TO THE POLLS? IT IS SPECIFIC, DEPENDS ON THE STATE. IN BLUE STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS THE MOST EXTREME, REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENT VOTERS AND DEMOCRATS ARE TIRED OF THE HIGH TAXES AND GOVERNMENT CONTROL, REGULATIONS THAT MAKE IT HARD FOR BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES TO SUCCEED, YOU ARE SEEING THE EFFECT OF THAT, IN OTHER STATES AND SEEING WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING NATIONALLY TO HELP US OUT, ENTHUSIASTIC TO CARRY THAT ON. DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN A VERY NEGATIVE AGENDA THEY HAVE BEEN PROPOSING AND NOT PROPOSING SOLUTIONS FOR AMERICA. SOME DEMOCRATIC CONSULTANTS, PEOPLE IN THE PARTY ARE WARNING DEMOCRATS ALL THEY ARE DOING IS CAMPAIGNING AGAINST DEMOCRATS ALL THEY ARE DOING IS CAMPAIGNING AGAINST THE PRESIDENT THAT WON'T WORK FOR PEOPLE ON THE GROUND IN THEIR STATES. WANT TO GET AHEAD, NOT GOING TO WORK IF YOU JUST CAMPAIGN ON IMPEACHING DONALD TRUMP. SPEAKING OF DONALD TRUMP, ON TWITTER HE SAID GREAT NIGHT FOR REPUBLICANS, CONGRATULATIONS TO JOHN COX ON A REALLY BIG NUMBER IN CALIFORNIA. HE CAN WIN. EVEN FAKE NEWS CNN SAID THE TRUMP IMPACT WAS REALLY BIG, MUCH BIGGER THAN THEY THOUGHT POSSIBLE, SO MUCH FOR THE BIG BLUE WAVE, IT MAY BE A BIG RED WAVE, WORKING HARD. HE SAID MANY MORE WAVE, WORKING HARD. HE SAID MANY MORE REPUBLICAN VOTERS SHOWED UP YESTERDAY THAN THE FAKE NEWS THOUGHT POSSIBLE. POLITICAL PUNDITS DON'T GET WHAT IS GOING ON OUT THERE OR THEY DO GET IT BUT REFUSED TO REPORT THE FACTS, REMEMBER DEMS ARE HIGH-TECH, HIGH CRIME, EASY TO BEAT. DONALD TRUMP AGREES WITH YOU, EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY AND WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT AS REPUBLICANS WE HAVE DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF RETIREMENTS, DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS, DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SEATS TO DEFEND, WE CAN'T REST ON OUR LAURELS BUT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER OF PICKUPS ON THE SENATE SIDE AS WELL. WHEN YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS IN HIGH TAX STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA PUSHING MORE TAXES, MORE REGULATION, SINGLE-PAYER HEALTHCARE AS THEIR AGENDA AMERICANS ARE ALARMED ABOUT THAT, WE ARE HAPPY TO SEE THE TURNOUT. EVEN AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET LIKE YOU SAID IN CALIFORNIA, A CONTESTED RACE, CONTESTED RACES IN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE PRIMARIES THIS WEEK WHERE REPUBLICANS MAY PICK UP THE SEAT AND NEWER FACES, ONE MORE FACTOR IS REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS HAVE A RULE WHERE THEY ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE LEADERS AND THAT FOSTERS DEMOCRATS HAVE A VERY OLDER
