WATCH THIS AD FROM THE REPUBLICANS. DEMOCRATS VILIFY JUDGE KAVANAUGH THEY TURN A BLIND EYE TO ONE OF THEIR OWN. SENATOR BROWN. BROWN'S EX-WIFE TESTIFIED UNDER OATH HE ABUSED HER. THE COURT RECORDS PROVE IT. RESTRAINING ORDER ISSUED TO PROTECT HER WHICH BROWN VIOLATED PHYSICALLY AND VERBALLY ABUSING THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILDREN. END THE HYPOCRISY. CALL HIM AND TELL BROWN TO RESIGN. Ed: WE ARE JOINED BY THE MAKER OF THE AD. GOOD EVENING, MARY. SOME PEOPLE WILL SEE THAT AND SAY THAT IS A TOUGH SHOT. BUT YOU BELIEVE THAT THE DEMOCRATS WENT AFTER JUSTICE KAVANAUGH NOW, AND WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER. DEMOCRATS HAVE TO END THE HYPOCRISY.
