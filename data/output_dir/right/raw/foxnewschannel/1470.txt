LIBYA MODEL ENDED IF KIM JONG UN

36
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,129
DOESN'T MAKE A DEAL.

IT WAS ONLY RECENTLY THAT HAS

52
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,325

65
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,050
I DON'T LIKE IT.

66
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,052
>> THE PRESIDENT LAID DOWN A BED

67
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,255

THIS BROUGHT A SHARP REACTION

72
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:26,930
FROM CHINA.

73
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,799
>> CHINA ABUSES THE ABUSE OF THE

74
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:31,301

75
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:34,904
IT WILL SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE

76
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:35,839
