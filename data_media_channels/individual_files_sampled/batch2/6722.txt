I'm also curious at his opening statement overall or in parts do you think that it helped him in the context of what we saw from Christine lousy well before he gave his opening statement we hadn't heard anything from him we had just heard compelling testimony from her now we've heard testimony from him that I am certain people who were like oh gosh she's pretty she's pretty compelling are more inclined to look for anything in his testimony folks who were on his side will look for anything in his testimony and they'll find it in there they find it in there mm-hmm so do you think it was active it was yet I think it was effective for his purposes but when you look at it like what if anything it all really can't effect this in the long run do you think anything that happens here there needs to be a huge public outcry to slow down this investigation and it is happening and it may happen earth to slow down this hearing process for a vote that's supposed to happen like tomorrow yeah but I do miss weekend there was some indication Trump might be calling for that he did what he had to do I wonder if during this break people are like bro you need to slow down you need to take a drink have a beer I mean I what I would do is be like this guy clearly seems like an alcoholic he is like kind of twitching and he's way too aggressive you're in a you're accused rapist attempted rapist and by others an accused rapist you should not be too aggressive right now well we sort of predicted that he would come out and be super aggressive I think in terms of evaluating the success of it you you have those two different parts you have his aggressive shouty defense of himself lapsing occasionally into barely controlled tears so I think that the aggressive shouty thing I think might play really poorly amongst for instance women but I don't know that he's necessarily trying to win women over I think that that would do well with Donald Trump Donald Trump wants someone who's strong yeah the question is that he's crying but he's also crying so Trump doesn't like crying and not just crying like at one point during his initial statement where he's yelling he's yelling and then he gets so sad thinking about the effect on his kids and then he gets it back too that might be effective but he continually likely brings up the calendar he starts to almost cry does that read as a person would had to have been lied about to have this emotional of an outburst I mean that's what ben shapiro is saying on twitter is that he would only respond this way if you were telling the truth i's a possible trump will see that or will he see a crybaby in his work I think Trump will see a crybaby I think Trump has to weigh that against the perception of having lost something but the next step in the day were to pull over so if you were to pull him if you were to but then again Trump could say listen I still think he's innocent but he is too weak to be on the Supreme Court I win by saying I'm pulling him and replacing him with someone else mm-hmm you can't deny that there is a midterm election coming up and any delay works it works to the benefit of the Democrats and this while it does fit into like a good strategy for delay it is also true that as was pointed out by I think Blumenthal or whoever it was in the preliminary questioning whenever anything like this has happened in the past the FBI has been called in to do an investigation so whether you indicate and what's frustrating about Cavanaugh Grassley everyone who says these accusations are too late that is not what the times I've movements about mm-hmm his constant exclamations about beer and trying to make a joke it reminds me of a great line from married with children I think it was it was a give me beer or give me death or both like yeah I don't and you know he also said that thing you may you may make me lose this vote which will make me quit or something like that do you think there will be a difference in how he behaves moving forward after this recess well I think the recess is important because it lets him sort of get control of himself it's possible that in reciting some of those same lines under questioning he might lapse into that sunken place again but I think that he needs this break badly because clearly in the transition from opening statement to the first few questions he did not recover he was still ready to sort of you know get a little bit like she needed caffeine she said going into her some openings he had too much maybe too much caffeine or something else yeah it's gonna be very interesting to find out what Donald Trump thinks of this I agree it like as much as he hates a crybaby he wants a win and important historical context in terms of how long it takes to nominate some of the Supreme Court and for them to get on no one on the court now has had that process happen fast enough where if it were to happen today they would be on before the election rights always taken weeks more than that and especially coming off of the heels of this it seems like it would take even longer and this for other things that have fallen apart that would cause Cavanaugh's and Grassley's and Lindsey Graham's lines of questioning to fall apart is that they keep saying things like you know if Gorsuch well I just want to say that Gorsuch was confirmed by these same people and there was no talk of any sexual assault claims so their argument that oh everyone from now on is just gonna be a victim to some erroneous assault claim no and it's that argument was disproven already and and I think it's even weaker with the additional details they give it so one of the things that that he was saying in his opening statement was not just this is a plot but it's a plot grounded in anger over the 2016 election this is a sort of revenge for Hillary Clinton he said okay well if that was the case they would have been more likely to deploy that against Gorsuch not not only because it was closer to the actual election by quite a bit but it was a seat that hypothetically Clinton would have been able to fill immediately after getting in you know into office so if there was going to be a revenge thing it would have happened the last time not this time the only counter-argument I could see to that is like we weren't even expecting this one this one is more important you're gonna replace what Scalia with someone who's conservative that's not a big difference right now this is the most important thing and timing is utterly of the essence and for that reason the Democrats are going harder but it's not just maybe one person it's not just one accuser this something that keeps coming up yeah and the the mental path that you have to take I think to be reasonable but still believe that he belongs on the court it requires some some difficult jumps like yeah I really don't think that again you can watch Christine glossy Ford's testimony and believe that she's lying about the fact that she was assaulted right I don't think there's any argument to be made that she would do this purely for political purposes and have it not be based in fact there's nothing about her that makes you think that what you have to believe and that's why they keep bringing this up is yes she was assaulted but she was assaulted by someone who looks like him she's getting fundamental facts about it wrong yes maybe someone tried to rape her but not him and that I think sorry my mic is a little messed up that is just a difficult case to make if someone had done what was what she alleges to you would you forget it would you like she saw those people after that she saw mark judge she talked about that would those details become so hazy over the decades that you totally attribute it to someone were else that years before he goes up for the Supreme Court you'd be talking about him in therapy still that is how wrong you are and you'd want the way that Cavanaugh is here saying interview me ask me questions you would think that everyone else whose integrity has been impugned by this would want to come forward and go through the same hearing I mean after all mark judge is an accomplice to an attempted rape in the scenario he is not simply some bystander he helped keep her like he said you should like you egged him on he was like jumping onto them like he was totally there but he doesn't want to defend himself no one I mean I see now when I go in there and your argument whether it's true or not would be like it's just all ridiculous anyway this whole thing isn't a political attempt a partisan hit job that's why you wouldn't do it but that's why the people who were there the Grassley's of the world who oversee this kind of process should say well I'm in charge and I will make sure that this is done properly but they don't care I think the backdrop of this when I asked what's the other side thinking is well attempted rape non attempted rape lying about it overtime whether that's true or not like the other side wants to kill babies and we have to stop it abortions important and that's some people will defend them no matter what and and and I that's the one thing I keep coming back to thanks for watching this free clip of The Young Turks don't forget to become a TYT member today for more exclusive content join now at TYT dot-com
