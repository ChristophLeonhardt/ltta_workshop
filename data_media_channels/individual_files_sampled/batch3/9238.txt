MICHELLE MALKIN AND DAN BONGINO AND MORE. YOU YOU WATCHED IT HERE LIVE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN A PACKED CROWD IN A RAUCOUS RALLY TAKING ON HIS OPPONENTS AND TOUTING A LONG LIST OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP: A VOTE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A VOTE TO REJECT THE RUTHLESS, OUTRAGEOUS TACTICS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. DEMOCRATS ARE SPENT EVERY MINUTE TRYING TO ROVER TURN THE RESULTS OF THE LAST ELECTION TRYING TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE LAST ELECTION. IT'S LIKE PART OF YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION. GET UP AND FIGHT DOWN. HONESTLY THE DEMOCRATS ARE A DISGRACE. THEY ARE. THEY ARE A DISGRACE. AND THE NUMBER ONE ENABLER OF THE DEMOCRATS IS THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA RIGHT BACK THERE. WHEN I SAY AND COME OUT WITH VERY, VERY STRONG STATEMENTS ABOUT MEDIA, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. THEY ARE TRULY AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. THE FAKE NEWS ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. THEY REALLY ARE. THEY ARE SO BAD. YOU DON'T EVEN GET. YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD LIKE LOW TAXES AND A STRONG MILITARY. NO CRIME, STRONG BORDERS. THEY DON'T. THIS MOVE 6 YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO REJECT THESE DISGRACEFUL POLITICAL HACKS. BUT YOU CAN ONLY DO IT YOU HAVE GOT TO VOTE REPUBLICAN. WE HAVE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN SO FAR LEFT WHERE POCAHONTAS IS CONSIDERED A CONSERVATIVE IN THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. SHE IS LIKE A CONSERVATIVE PERSON. POCAHONTAS. ELIZABETH WARREN, SHE IS CONSIDERED LIKE A CONSERVATIVE PERSON. THESE PEOPLE HAVE GONE CRAZY. THEY HAVE GONE LOCO. HOW ABOUT CORY BOOKER. DID YOU WATCH THE PERFORMANCE? HE RAN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY INTO THE GROUND. NOW HE WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT, RIGHT? WHAT WAS THE MOMENT HE SAID HE HAD?
