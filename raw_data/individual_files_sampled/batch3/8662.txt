INSPECTOR GENERAL OF PURE BEFORE A REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WANTING ANSWERS ABOUT BIAS IN THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS START US OFF TONIGHT. BUSY DAY TONIGHT. WE WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY. LATE TODAY, THE HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY KIRSTJEN NIELSEN APPEARED AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND POINTED TO A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER ILLEGALLY. MORE THAN 50,000 A MONTH FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS. 400% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SO-CALLED FAMILY UNITS. BUT THE NEW ADMINISTRATION PRACTICE OF CRIMINALLY PROSECUTING PEOPLE WHO COME ACROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY HAS CREATED A VERY LARGE POLITICAL PROBLEM FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. WITH A STORM OF OUTRAGE GROWING OVER THE SEPARATION OF CHILDREN PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY LAID THE BLAME SQUARELY ON THE DEMOCRATS. I SAY IT VERY STRONGLY. IT IS THE DEMOCRATS' FAULT. THEY ARE OBSTRUCTIONIST. AND THEY ARE OBSTRUCTING. DEMOCRATS OUTRAGED AT THE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY AT THE BORDER WERE PEOPLE WHO CROSS ILLEGALLY ARE HELD FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AND SEPARATED FROM ANY CHILDREN THEY MAY HAVE BROUGHT WITH THEM. EVEN SOME REPUBLICANS ARE CRITICAL. IN A "WASHINGTON POST" OP-ED, FORMER FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH WROTE "THIS ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY IS CRUEL. IT'S IMMORAL, AND IT BREAKS MY HEART." PRESIDENT TRUMP INSISTS HE WAS FORCED TO IMPLEMENT THE POLICY AFTER A DRAMATIC INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE, SOME CRIMINALS, CROSSING THE BORDER WITH CHILDREN. THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT BE A MIGRANT CAMP AND IT WILL NOT BE A REFUGEE HOLDING FACILITY. WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN TO THE UNITED STATES, NOT ON MY WATCH. ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE MERELY ENFORCING LAWS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS, SOMETHING THEY SAY PREVIOUS WHITE HOUSE IS FAILED TO DO. BUT THE POLITICAL FIRESTORM HAS HEATED TO THE POINT THAT THE DHS SECRETARY HANDLED A LATE DAY BRIEFING AT THE WHITE HOUSE. CONGRESS AND THE COURTS CRATED THIS PROBLEM AND CONGRESS ALONE CAN FIX IT. UNTIL THEN, WE WILL ENFORCE EVERY LAW WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS TO DEFEND THE SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES. THE WHITE HOUSE CALLING ON CONGRESS TO CHANGE THE LAWS AND REDUCE IF NOT ELIMINATE ALTOGETHER THE NEED TO SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS. ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION, OFFICIALS WILL KEEP UP THE PRESSURE ON LAWMAKERS THIS WEEK. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE SAY YOU ARE USING CHILDREN AS A LEVER TO TRY TO GET THEM TO TAKE LEGISLATIVE ACTION. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? I SAY THAT'S A COWARDLY RESPONSE. IT IS WITHIN THEIR POWER TO MAKE THE LAWS AND CHANGE THE LAWS. THEY SHOULD DO SO. PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO WEIGHED IN ON THAN A TRICK OF INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT THAT THE FBI CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION. AS A SET UP TODAY THE PRESIDENT TWEETING "WHY WAS THE FBI SICK LOSER PETER STRZOK WORKING ON THOUGH TOTALLY DISCREDITED MUELLER TEAM OF 13 ANGRY AND CONFLICTED DEMOCRATS WHEN STRZOK WAS GIVING CROOKED HILLARY A FREE PASS YET TELLING HIS LOVER LISA PAGE THAT "WE'LL STOP" TRUMP FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT? WITCH HUNT! "THE FBI DIRECTOR SAYS THE REPORT DOESN'T ADDRESS IT. DEMOCRATS ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF USING THE IG REPORT AS A BLUDGEON TO DISCREDIT THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION WITH TWEETS LIKE "COMEY GAVE STRZOK HIS MARCHING ORDERS." HE IS DISTORTING THE REPORT. HE'S WEAPONIZING IT TO DISCREDIT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. AND UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. FBI DIRECTOR SAID TODAY HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER IS ON A WITCH HUNT, ASKED ABOUT IT LATE TODAY, PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS SAID THE PRESIDENT'S FIRM IN HIS BELIEF THAT THE
