Most of the objects look
like a kind of an oversized
walnut, and you open it up 
and inside are tiny scenes —
very complicated,
almost noisy.
There's one bead where 
my colleagues counted how many
figures were just
in the top half —
58 separate figures
within that tiny space.
These really existed as ways 
for people to meditate.
Kind of a portal to prayer.
So for example in a scene like
the crucifixion there
are tiny spears.
Every spear is a little
splinter of wood,
separately inserted.
With the wise men,
I love it because
the first of the kings is
already offering a gift to the
baby Jesus.
The second king is right 
behind him.
The third king is on the
opposite side
right next to his camel and
his servant has this bag
and you can tell he's
hurrying him to get that gift
out of the bag because his turn
is coming and he might be late.
All of that within two inches.
It's extraordinary.
