MORE ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY
AND OTHER TOPICS MAKING NEWS,
KELLYANNE CONWAY.
THE PRESIDENT JUST SUGGESTED
THERE MIGHT BE MORE BEHIND THIS
AND THIS SUDDEN CARAVAN RIGHT
BEFORE THE MID TERMS.
I MUST TELL YOU, IT SEEMS TO
HAVE HAPPENED ALL OF A SUDDEN.
I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT A CARAVAN
SINCE OBAMA INVITED THEM IN 2014
AND 2015.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE GENESIS
OF THIS SUDDEN MOVEMENT TOWARD
THE SOUTHERN BORDER?
>> WHATEVER THE GENESIS.
IT'S GREAT THAT CAMERAS AND THE
LIGHTS ARE ON.
I'M A FAN OF SHOWING AMERICA
WHAT IS HAPPENING.
NOT JUST WHAT IS BEING CARRIED
THROUGH SOME OF THE REPORTS.
BUT JUST SHINE THE LIGHT.
BRING THE CAMERAS.
NOW PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT IT
REALLY MEANS.
BEFORE THEY SAW WHAT THEY CALLED
THE KID IN CAGES WHICH IT TURNED
OUT TO BE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S KIDS
IN CAGES.
BUT LET'S SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING
AND JUXTAPOSE THAT WITH A
PRESIDENT SAYING IN LIGHT OF THE
MODERNIZED REVOLUTIONARY TRADE
DEAL, THE USMCA.
WE HAVE BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH
MEXICO NOW AND THEY ARE HELPING
NOW.
JUDGE JEANINE: IF THEY RESPECT
THIS PRESIDENT AND
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, AND I
BELIEVE YOU, I SHOULD BE
COMFORTABLE BELIEVING MEXICO IS
GOING TO STOP THEM BEFORE THEY
COME TO THE UNITED STATES.
>> THEY OUGHT TO DO THAT.
IF YOU LOOK STATISTICALLY, UNTIL
VERY RECENTLY, THE PREDOMINANT
TRAFFICKER, THE PREDOMINANT
PERSON COMING OVER THE BORDER
WAS A SINGLE MALE COMING IN FROM
MEXICO.
NOW 45% OR SO ARE FAMILY UNITS
COMING IN UNACCOMPANIED MINORS
OR PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY ARE A
FAMILY COMING IN FROM CENTRAL
AMERICA.
WE ARE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO
SMUGGLE CHILDREN OVER AND
PRETEND THEY ARE A FAMILY UNIT.
BY THE WAY, I TALKED TO A NUMBER
OF CABINET SECRETARIES AND
SENIOR OFFICIALS.
OUR BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN AT THE
BORDER ARE DOING THE BEST THEY
CAN.
AND THEY RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY
DAY TO BE THERE AND ASK
LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS.
IF YOU WANT TO STAND IN LINE AT
ONE OF THE 26 PORTS OF ENTRY AND
STAND IN LINE YOU CAN DO THAT.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SEXUAL
ASSAULTS ARE UP.
THE CHILD SMUGGLING IS UP.
THE DRUG SMUGGLING IS UP.
WE ARE A SOVEREIGN NATION
WITHOUT PHYSICAL BORDERS.
JUDGE JEANINE: I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THE HEROIN CROSSING THE
BORDER.
THE POISON KILLING HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS.
A THOUSAND A WEEK.
MINIMUM.
>> THERE IS NO DOUBT.
THIS PRESIDENT HAS HAD AS A
MAJOR FOCUS STOPPING THE DRUG
SUPPLY AND DRUG DEMAND CRISIS.
72,000 AMERICANS DEAD LAST YEAR.
90% OF HEROIN IN THIS COUNTRY
COMES THROUGH THE SOUTHERN
BORDER.
THE FENTANYL WHICH IS NFERRED
LABS IN CHINA WE ARE TOLD IS
ALSO COMING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN
BORDER BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS
IT'S AN EASY WAY TO GET IN.
THIS IS VERY PROBLEMATIC.
HE'S CONSTANTLY TALKING ABOUT
THE POISON COMING OVER THE
SOUTHERN BORDER COMING TO YOUR
COMMUNITY.
THIS OPIOID AND DRUG CRISIS IS
NO LONGER SOMEBODY ELSE'S
COWORKER, KID OR COMMUNITY.
IT'S TOUCHING EVERY COMMUNITY IN
THIS COUNTRY.
JUDGE JEANINE: THE PRESIDENT
SEEMS TO HAVE INDICATED THAT
KHASHOGGI, HE BELIEVES THE
EXPLANATION FOR KHASHOGGI'S
DEATH GIVEN BY THE SAUDIS, BUT
THERE SEEMS TO BE EVIDENCE OF
HIM BEING TORTURED AND
CHOKEHOLD.
IT WASN'T JUST A FIGHT, IT WAS A
PLANNED EXECUTION WITH BONE
SAWS.
>> I HAVE KNOW INFORMATION TO
VERIFY ANY OF THAT.
I WILL STAND BY THE COMMENTS THE
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE.
THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE ONGOING.
THE PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR THAT IT
SEEMS BY THE INFORMATION THAT
THE MAN IS DEAD.
IT'S UPSETTING TO SEE A MAJOR
NETWORK RUN A FALSE REPORT THAT
OUR PRESIDENT SAID IS INCORRECT.
SOMEBODY READ A TRANSCRIPT FROM
AN AUDIOTAPE.
IT'S THAT KIND OF REPORTING THAT
HURTS INVESTIGATIONS BUT I'M NOT
GOING TO GET AHEAD OF THAT.
JEAN REQUIRE MANY THAT KIND OF
FALSE REPORTING THAT AMERICANS
BELIEVE IS GOING ON.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AND THAT'S ALSO WHY THE MEDIA
HAS A 20% APPROVAL RATING.
THE PRESIDENT SAID IF THIS
HAPPENED, THEN THERE COULD BE
