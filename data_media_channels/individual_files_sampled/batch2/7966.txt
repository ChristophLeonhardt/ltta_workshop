Kanye West is making headlines again which is fantastic Kanye West was recently tweeting about a conservative black woman that he is apparently very supportive of her name is Candace Owens and she has said some things in the past that might make members of the black community raise an eyebrow or two now Kanye said the following about her via Twitter I love the way Candace Owens thinks only free thinkers okay great so what does Owens think well in the past she has said it's embarrassing in regard to the black community you're not living through anything right now you're overly privileged Americans what maybe you're an overly privileged American because you get paid a lot of money by conservatives to say crap like that but really all or most african-americans in this country are overly privileged so she's the communications director for Turning Point USA this is an organization that spreads conservative propaganda on college campuses and she used to be on the left side of the political spectrum but claims that she took the so-called red pill and is now conservative I by the way did she give back the money that she got from a lawsuit for people infringing on her rights because she took the red pill so I'm sure that she looked back and said oh remember when I sued for for my rights and I want money oh my god I should go apologize to that person to give her the money back yeah because I was just overly privileged so she also talks about the black community by saying the following they're a bunch of whiney toddlers pretending to be oppressed for attention someone doing something for attention hmm what does that remind me of yeah so look Owens is just part of an ever-growing group of people who realize mmm there's really not a lot of money in being a principled person but there is a lot of money in being a member of a disenfranchised group who speaks out against that disenfranchised group you see it with people like Tommy Lauren who say ridiculous crazy things about other women on a regular basis you see it with you know someone who identifies as gay absolutely bashing the gay community you see you see it on fox news all the time where they have black commentators who are essentially paid to say horrible things about the black community it's a lucrative thing it's super lucrative so I don't know if it's the red pill so much as a massive profitable organization that's paying you to say things yeah perhaps the green pill if you will Candice owns also has said that black men getting shot by police isn't about racism yeah just coincidence I'm sure Candace Owens has gone on Infowars many many times because Hey look somebody's got to fight the 80% human 80% gorilla 80% pig hybrids that they talk about on Infowars so she seems like a legitimate person I have another another tweet of hers in regard to the NRA she said and by the way this was in the middle of the NRA getting a lot of heat and criticism because you know innocent black people like falando castile right license carrying gun owner gets shot and killed by cops NRA doesn't say anything about it right and so NRA is getting criticism and she decides no this is my opportunity to head up to stand up for the NRA and she says the NRA is the oldest civil rights organization in the country in the 1960s they helped to Train black Americans to use guns to defend themselves against the KKK a Democrat terrorist group oh please Jesus Christ who'd be so stupid as to like the obvious misinformation and propaganda the Kandice owns is putting out for profit oh right Calle West can we please stop having the debate as to whether Kanye West is brilliant misunderstood poet or he's a total idiot that debate has been settled he he's a total and utter moron he's one of the dumbest guys in the country so dumb he's trumpian in his level of intelligence and unsurprisingly he also likes Donald Trump and by the way if you're having trouble figuring out why that's also because of the money because Kanye's Inc readily rich or he was before you bankrupted himself like Donald Trump okay and so he's like yeah race whatever tax cuts yay Jesus figure that out yeah okay he's a total loser I can't begin to describe the disdain I have for Kanye West I just think that Kanye West I I don't know what's going on with him and he went from being someone who really understood some of the institutionalized racism in the country if you could recall you know his infamous statement in regard to Bush not caring about black people he was very aware of what was going on and then all of a sudden you know I feel like his behavior changed after his mother passed away and look I don't know I don't know what his motivations are I don't know what's going through his mind to be quite honest with you I don't really care what Kanye West thinks what I actually find more interesting is the motivations behind people who go from being extremely liberal to being extremely conservative yeah and so look I I don't care about why he had his break or whatever and I don't think he ever had a break I think he was massively ridiculously overrated to begin with and what does he do he does music okay bless his heart okay that doesn't mean that you're good at other things and so what he did the comment about Bush which I celebrated was a great comment it was true partly to get attention all right because that's the one thing that he's really good at just like Donald Trump I'm gonna say anything that comes to the top of my head it doesn't matter how much it offends other people doesn't matter how much it hurts them but me me me me me me I want to spotlight I want to spotlight so now Kanye West likes Donald Trump and Candace Owens not at all surprising just to understand buyer beware Kanye West is a selfish conservative prick problem solved if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now tea why
