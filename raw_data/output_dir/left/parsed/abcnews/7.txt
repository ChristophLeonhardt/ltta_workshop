HE IS BEING WELCOMED, TERRY, BY 
A WONDERFUL HONOR GUARD.
>> Reporter: BEAUTIFUL, FORMAL 
AND SAD, OF COURSE.
THE GOVERNOR HERE TO GREET THE 
FAMILY, AND SENATOR McCAIN BEING
BROUGHT ACCOMPANIED BY AN 
ARIZONA NATIONAL GUARD UNIT, AND
HERE ALIGNING THE WAY TO THE 
CAPITAL.
MEMBERS OF THE U.S. ARMED FORCES
AND LOCAL AND STATE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, AND PERHAPS MOST 
MOVINGLY, A CONTINGENT DOWN AT 
THE END OF THE BLOCK OF MEN AND 
WOMEN IN CIVILIAN DRESS, 
PROCLAIMING SOME OF THEIR CAPS 
AND T-SHIRTS THAT THEY ARE 
VETERANS THEMSELVES, SOME 
VIETNAM VETERANS HAILING AND 
HONORING SENATOR McCAIN'S 
SERVICE.
ALL IS STILL HERE.
THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE LINING UP
TO VIEW SENATOR McCAIN FOR 
HOURS.
THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET 
INTO THE CAPITAL UNTIL ABOUT 
2:00 P.M. THIS AFTERNOON LOCAL 
TIME, BUT WE MET THEM EARLY THIS
MORNING.
HE IS ONE OF THE STATE'S 
FAVORITE SONS, ADOPTED ARIZONA 
STATE, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT.
THIS STATE PREPARING NOW TO SAY 
GOO
GOOD-BYE.
>> YOU SAY ADOPTED STATE.
HE DIDN'T HAVE A HOMETOWN UNTIL 
HE WAS 45 YEARS OLD.
LOVE AND AMBITION BROUGHT HIM 
HOME, HIS WIFE, WHO IS IN THE 
MOTORCADE, AND THEN THE SENATOR.
COKIE ROBERTS ALSO JOINING US 
FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. TODAY.
TERRY MENTIONED THOSE VETERANS.
WHAT A BOND JOHN McCAIN HAS HAD 
WITH HIM.
>> PEOPLE THAT NEVER MET HIM 
STILL CONNECTED WITH HIM THROUGH
HIS SERVICE TO THE MILITARY, AND
HIS CHAMPIONING TO THE MILITARY 
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS IN 
CONGRESS.
THERE WERE REPUBLICANS 
NOMINATED, A WOMAN, A VETERAN, 
TO RUN FOR THE SENATE THIS TIME 
AROUND, BUT THESE ARE GREAT 
MOMENTS, GEORGE, BECAUSE WITH 
THESE HONORED POLITICIANS, YOU 
HAVE BOTH THE RELIGIOUS FUNERAL 
AND THE CIVIC FUNERAL, AND TODAY
IS THE FIRST OF JOHN McCAIN'S 
CIVIL FUNERALS AND ANOTHER ONE 
WILL FOLLOW HERE IN WASHINGTON.
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE 
PUBLIC THAT HE SERVED TO SAY 
THAT THEY HONOR HIM, AND 
GOOD-BYE.
>> NOBODY WILL BE TURNED AWAY 
FROM THE ARIZONA STATE CAPITAL.
AS LONG AS PEOPLE WANT TO PAY 
THEIR RESPECTS.
COKIE MENTIONS THE FUNERAL, AND 
JON KARL ALSO JOINING US FROM 
WASHINGTON, D.C.
THIS STATE CAPITAL REALLY 
RESERVED FOR THE GIANTS OF THE 
SENATE.
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY.
THIS IS -- IF YOU LOOK AT IN 
TOTALITY, THE EVENTS OF THIS 
WEEK, THIS IS A FAREWELL 
FITTING, GEORGE, OF A PRESIDENT.
JOHN McCAIN TWICE RAN FOR 
PRESIDENT, FAILED BOTH TIMES, 
BUT IS REMEMBERED IN TERMS 
CERTAINLY IN THE VERY LEAST, A 
GIANT OF THE SENATE, BUT 
SOMEBODY BEYOND THAT, AN 
AMERICAN STATESMAN, AN AMERICAN 
HERO, SOMEBODY WHO PLAYED AN 
OUTSIZED ROLE IN AMERICAN 
POLITICS AND IN AMERICAN LIFE.
>> WE NOW SEE THE HEARSE 
CARRYING JOHN McCAIN PULLING UP 
TO THE CAPITAL BEING GREETED BY 
GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY.
AS TERRY MORAN SAID, THE ARIZONA
NATIONAL GUARD WILL CARRY THE 
BODY THROUGH THE PLAZA.
MRS. McCAIN WILL BE GREETED BY 
THE GHOVERNOR.
THE FAMILY WILL FOLLOW BEHIND.
ABOUT AN HOUR SERVICE TODAY IN 
THE CAPITAL, AND THE CAPITAL 
WILL REMAIN OPEN FOR THOSE IN 
ARIZONA WHO WANT TO PAY THEIR 
RESPECTS TO SENATOR McCAIN.
THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF, WHO JUST 
WON A PRIMARY FOR HIS 
RE-ELECTION IN NOVEMBER, FACING 
HIS CHANCE FOR RE-ELECTION AS 
JON SAID, AND WE ALSO HAD A 
SENATE PRIMARY YESTERDAY.
NOT THE SENATE SEAT TO REPLACE 
JOHN McCAIN.
THAT REPLACEMENT WILL BE 
APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AFTER 
THE BURIAL OF JOHN McCAIN ON 
SUNDAY.
THIS WAS TO REPLACE JEFF FLAKE 
WHO WAS RETIRING FROM THE SENATE
AS WE SEE CINDY McCAIN NOW 
APPROACH ALONG WITH HER SONS, 
JACK AND JIMMY, APPROACHING 
GOVERNOR DUCEY.
AS WE SAID, CINDY McCAIN BROUGHT
JOHN McCAIN TO ARIZONA.
SHE BREW UP THERE.
HER FATHER HAD BEEN A BEER 
DISTRIBUTOR IN THE STATE.
YOU SEE THERE, BOTH SENATOR 
McCAIN'S SONS, JACK AND JIMMY, 
SERVE IN THE MILITARY.
JACK, A NAVY HELICOPTER PILOT, 
AND JIMMY.
OF COURSE, JOHN McCAIN COMES 
FROM AN HISTORIC MILITARY 
FAMILY.
BOTH HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER 
ADMIRALS.
AS WE SEE THERE, THE HEARSE 
BEING OPENED.
WHEN THE VIETNAMESE FOUND THAT 
OUT, THEY OFFERED JOHN THE 
CHANCE TO COME HOME.
THEY SAID NO.
HE WOULD NOT COME BEFORE THOSE 
WHO WERE CAPTURED BEFORE HIM, 
TAKEN AS WELL AS THE HONOR GUARD
APPROACHES THE HEARSE.
>> JOHN McCAIN, HIS CASKET 
DRAPED.
NOW ENTERING THE ARIZONA STATE 
CAPITOL, LYING IN STATE.
THERE WILL BE A SHORT SERVICE 
OVER THE NEXT HOUR, MARKED BY 
HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE IN THE 
SENATE, SENATOR KYLE, JIM COLBY,
AND SENATOR JEFF FLAKE.
A MENTEE WILL DELIVER THE 
BENEDICTION BEFORE HE LIES IN 
STATE FOR THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA.
WE SEE CINDY McCAIN NOW ENTER 
THE CAPITOL FLANKED BY HER SONS 
JACK AND JIMMY.
THE REST OF THE McCAIN FAMILY 
WILL FOLLOW.
WE'RE GOING TO RETURN NOW TO OUR
REGULAR PROGRAMMING.
ALL OF YOU WHO WANT TO WATCH AND
CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE SERVICE 
ON OUR LIVESTREAM ON 
ABCNEWS.COM, AND OF
