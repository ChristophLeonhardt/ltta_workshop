00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:08,980
The design of this shoe starts in Oregon in 1981 and with a man called Tinker Hatfield.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,300
He was an architect for Nike, hired to draw up offices and showrooms on the companyâ€™s campus.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,500
After making a statement on the outside
of buildings,

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,440
he was asked to join the designers on the inside.

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,919
In a race to develop sneakers, a former NASA engineer had recently introduced the idea of sealing

6
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:30,349
air bubbles in the soles for extra comfort
and performance.

7
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:35,680
But competition was fierce and Nike still
needed an edge.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,070
Hatfield headed to Paris in search of inspiration.

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,000
While he was there he visited the Pompidou Centre, a radical building famous for

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,460
its inside out design, which exposed the buildingâ€™s components like escalators

11
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,420
and heating pipes for everyone to see.

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,370
Hatfield decided to apply the same principle to his own design, revealing the inner workings

13
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,760
of his shoe by making the air cushioning system visible.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,640
The marketing team thought the air bubble would seem like a weakness,

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,920
but the Nike Air Max 1 was an instant hit when it launched in 1987.

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,940
Originally pairs sold for $75, now they
go for double that.

17
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,560
Today Tinker Hatfield is one of the most successful shoes designers in the world.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,800
He even created those legendary self-lacing sneakers of Back to the Future fame.

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,660
Stylish and innovative, this is the design
that stayed one step ahead,

20
00:01:33,660 --> 00:00:00,000
simply by being turned inside out.
