1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
“No more free passes, no more
get out of jail free cards,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,920
no more lawlessness.”

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,060
“The United States will
not be a migrant camp.”

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,650
“What this administration
is doing is inhumane.”

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,590
“It is inconsistent
with our American values.”

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,718
“It's barbaric.”

7
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:29,918
“This I do think ought
to be addressed.”

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,470
“And I say it’s very strongly
the Democrats’ fault.”

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,460
“We would like to fix these loopholes.

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,340
And if Democrats want
to get serious about it,

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,120
instead of playing
political games,

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,570
they're welcome to come here and
sit down with the president

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,050
and actually do
something about it.”

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,350
“We cannot and will not
encourage people to bring

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,830
their children or other
children to the country

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,009
unlawfully by giving them
immunity in the process.”

17
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,990
“I have not been directed
to do that for purposes

18
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,100
of deterrence, no.

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,140
My decision has
been that anyone

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,450
who breaks the law
will be prosecuted.”

21
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,880
“Our administration has
had the same position

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,110
since we started on Day 1, that we were

23
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,850
going to enforce the law.”

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,190
“... you to the apostle
Paul and his clear and wise

25
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,260
command in Romans 13 to obey
the laws of the government

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:00:00,000
because God has ordained
the government for his purposes.”
