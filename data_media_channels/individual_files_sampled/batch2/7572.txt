researchers are attempting to identify genetic differences among transgender individuals versus individuals who identify as cisgender or the gender that they were born with now the reason for this is to understand the transgender community a little better and possibly even improve their medical attention for that community but it also of course has something to do with political reasons as well now the researchers aren't studying this for political reasons they simply want to improve healthcare for the trans community but some are worried that this could have some political ramifications so I'll get to that in just a second but first five research institutions in Europe and the United States including Vanderbilt University Medical Center George Washington University and Boston Children's Hospital is looking to the genome that's a person's complete set of DNA for clues about whether transgender people are born that way and so of course whenever it comes to the LGBT community there is this debate about whether or not that lifestyle is a choice or if it's an identity that individuals are born with I don't think it really matters that much if it's a choice or if it's a you know something that they're born with but it is important to understand you know how how humans work and how identities are developed so researchers have extracted DNA from blood samples of 10,000 people 3,000 of them transgender and the rest non transgender or cisgender so one of the researchers says says that knowing what variations transgender people have in common and comparing those patterns to those of cisgender people in the study may help investigators understand what role the genome plays in everyone's gender identity yes so look this could be great and it could be disastrous so let's talk about the good stuff first of all if there's health conditions that afflict transgender people maybe this could help figure that out and and help lead to treating them okay so that's the primary reason folks are doing it and that's great news the other thing that he could show is that no it's not a choice this is somebody didn't wake up at the age of 14 or 18 or 28 ago I'd like to be a different sex yeah just cuz I mean the fact that conservatives believe that is mind-boggling like really you thought they just woke up one day and just thought it was cool or fun or hip right and did gender reassignment surgery it's just I can't believe they believe that okay so at least that would if it you find it in the genes that would put that to rest no they were obviously born that way on the other hand the potentially disastrous stuff is well if you have it in the genes now we can manipulate genes in that inside embryos so will it lead to people trying to cure them right or if if the person is already born and identifies as a different gender than what he or she was born with will this lead to people supporting you know treatments I forget what what they're called they still do it for gay individuals and they're ridiculous the gay therapy the conversion therapy thank you I R is there gonna be this emergence of conversion therapy for the trans community which you know is hideous look I why are people so obsessed with hating on individuals that have no impact on their lives whatsoever right so I don't think it's a choice I don't think anyone chooses to be part of a community of people that are regularly discriminated against have to deal with violence in a lot of cases murder there the suicide rate among the trans community is insanely high because of high levels of depression I mean I don't think anybody chooses to go through all that but with that said even if there was some evidence indicating that they're not born that way and they've decided that they want to go through the hell of you know what it's like to be a transgender individual in the United States why does it matter to conservatives like why does that bother them so much yeah it's that the Nana song about it and this is stunning 40% of transgender people in America attempted suicide 40% that is unbelievable and you think people are going to choose to do that right so okay now but it doesn't look I'm always for science so I want to study it and I want to figure it out and as long as we're the truth it's up to us to figure out what to do with that truth right okay and so by all means have at it and then you might find out and I had this very interesting interview with an author on on the show that studied what society calls perversions they're not really perversions they're just different fetishes okay and and he found out that he said oh you developed them between the ages of four and nine and I said well look you might actually develop them between zero and four we just don't remember that he's like that's a good point so some let's call it zero to nine it and I said well if it's true for fetishes could it be true for being gay and he's like well you know that I guess that's and he was gay himself but he's like yeah I guess that's theoretically possible so but it doesn't mean that that's a bad thing so if you developed you know you know let's go with our standard fetishes a foot fetish right and so what why do we have to cure that right if you became your LGBT I don't think that's what it is right but let's say that they found that that is what it is and but they just think by definition it's a bad thing right and and the reality is it's just because of what your preachers taught you whether you're Christian or Muslim etc I think it even goes further than that because I think that there are there is definitely a population of non-religious people who have the same type of visceral or negative reaction to the LGBT community or the trans community specifically and honestly I think it has more to do with fear and that fear comes from ignorance and and I get it sometimes if you're fearful about a community of people or a certain demographic that you don't understand you know you can have that negative reaction you don't understand them it's it's a human instinct it's a human reaction I get that and so I'm not trying to you know paint all of them is like these hateful bigoted individuals but what I will say is take a moment to just stop and think about it okay if they're not having any type of impact on you personally or if they're harming anyone in any negative way why do you care why do you go out of your way to make their lives miserable yeah so I think that it's the fear is actually more specific I think it's not like they think they're gonna be attacked by transgender people sometimes they'll say that in the bathroom controversy a setter but no their fear is that they think it's a choice because remember sexuality is a spectrum and so it's not it's unlikely to be binary you're either gay or you're straight you know you're somewhere on the spectrum so maybe some of those folks are closer to the LGBT part of the spectrum than they would like to admit and they think well I know it's a choice for me I could go either way so if you allow this then I'm gonna go in the way that you know that my parents taught me is a bad thing and so and they and it's this is a choice for me it and what what's the hardest thing in the world escaping your own perspective so if it's a choice for me it's probably a choice for them you know if they're transgender look and that that's you know where that goes in the spectrums that hold everything but you it's if you're going to gender reassignment surgery you're clearly at a minimum at one end of the spectrum right and so that is all that's not as much of a choice as you think it is if you're conservative and you think I could go with guys or I could go with girls don't give me that choice I don't know the choice I'll make and and look finally two last things here if we're gonna study this for God's sake pick real scientists because I'm some unfortunately there's some clowns at right-wing scientists like this guy Paul McHugh who's a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins which it's a great school right he calls trans people counterfeit what that's not a science that's your and it's a value judgment that's right right so he might do great research in other areas which I he's where he's at but he has a clear bias there because if you start with the trans community consists of or fit people well then that bias is gonna lead into your methodology a little oh he says and then this is he actually worse his last statement on how do you know that it's a choice and not there's something they were born with he says if it were obvious they would have found it long ago oh my god don't let him do the research he's not doing the by the way the with the research that I mentioned earlier on he is not involved in that yes so do real research on it let's find out what it is and it's fine and by the way look we mention all the bad sides of the guys who are so conflicted about the choices Center but don't lose track the country is changing significantly 68% according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll very established legitimate posts 68% of Americans say transgender people should be in the military not just that they have the same rights but you know Trump said they shouldn't be in the military they're saying no they should be in the military so America is on the right path it's a bumpy road but we are going to the right place if you like this video you love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
