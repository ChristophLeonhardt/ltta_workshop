>> Chris: AFTER OUR INTERVIEW,
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK US ACROSS
THE HALL TO THE OVAL OFFICE IN
THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENS, THE
PRESIDENT DISCUSSED HIS
TRANSITION FROM REAL ESTATE
TYCOON TO LEADER OF THE FREE
WORLD AND HE GAVE SOME INSIGHT
INTO HOW HE MAKES THE TOUGH
DECISIONS HE FACES EVERY DAY.
>> Chris: SO IF YOU GOTTEN
COMFORTABLE WITH THE PLACE YOU
HAVE TO?
>> President Trump: I HAVE.
I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE.
IT TOOK ME A LITTLE WHILE.
IT SORT OF INCREDIBLE.
YOU SAY YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES AND I SAY WOW
AND IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE TO
GET OVER.
>> Chris: THE FIRST TIME THAT
YOU'RE IN THE OVAL OFFICE BY
YOURSELF, EVERYBODY IS GONE,
YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM.
THE ICONIC ROOM.
>> President Trump: I'VE HAD
PEOPLE COME INTO THIS -- THE
BIGGEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD,
PRESIDENTS, PRIME MINISTERS, THE
HEADS OF THE BIGGEST COUNTRIES
IN THE WORLD AND THEY ALWAYS
STOP AND THEY SAY THIS IS THE
OVAL OFFICE.
THIS IS THE OVAL OFFICE.
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE
WORLD.
THIS IS THE RESOLUTE DESK, VERY
FAMOUS.
THIS IS WHERE JOHN JOHN AT THE
TIME, RIGHT?
JOHN KENNEDY WAS RIGHT HERE.
A LITTLE DEAL THAT OPENS UP AND
A FAMOUS PICTURE.
I COULD SHOW YOU THAT PICTURE,
BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT
TASK.
SEVEN DESKS AND AS PRESIDENT YOU
CAN CHOOSE ANY ONE OF THE DESKS.
I THINK THIS IS THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL IN TERMS OF THE
CARVING.
IN MANY RESPECTS IT'S JUST SOME
PEOPLE THAT I RESPECT.
>> Chris: WHEN YOU'RE SITTING
AT THE DESK, HOW DO YOU MAKE
DECISIONS?
DO YOU AGONIZE OVER THEM?
DO YOU A SECOND ASK YOURSELF?
>> President Trump: I DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT.
I DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW I MAKE
THEM.
I MAKE WHAT I CONSIDER THE RIGHT
DECISION.
I HAVE GREAT PEOPLE WORKING AT
THE WHITE HOUSE.
THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT.
I HAVE SOME TREMENDOUSLY
TALENTED PEOPLE AND I WILL TALK
TO THEM AND SOMETIMES I WILL
HAVE THEM GO AT EACH OTHER.
I DO LIKE THAT.
THEY ARE VERY COMPETITIVE PEOPLE
AND AT THE END I MAKE A DECISIO
DECISION.
AND CERTAINLY ON THE ECONOMY,
WE'VE MADE A LOT OF GOOD
DECISIONS AND I WANT TO KEEP IT
THAT WAY.
>> Chris: DO YOU EVER
SECOND-GUESS YOURSELF?
>> President Trump: ALL THE
TIME.
I'VE DONE THINGS WHERE I WISHED
I WENT A DIFFERENT ROUTE.
BUT THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU
CHANGE COURSE AND YOU BRING IT
BACK.
>> Chris: TOUGHEST DECISION
YOU'VE HAD TO MAKE AS PRESIDENT?
>> President Trump: I THINK
NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN VERY TOUGH.
WE WERE VERY CLOSE.
WHEN I TOOK OVER,
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT'S BY
FAR THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT
THIS COUNTRY HAS.
AND I THINK WE HAD A REAL
DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY TO GO
IN NORTH KOREA.
AND CERTAINLY SO FAR I'M VERY
HAPPY WITH THE WAY WE WENT, VERY
GOOD RELATIONSHIP.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
COULD BE.
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES, THAT'S
THE WAY IT GOES.
I GO WITH THE WAY WE HAVE TO GO.
BUT SO FAR IT'S BEEN GOOD.
WE HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHI
RELATIONSHIP.
WE MADE I THINK SOME GREAT
DECISIONS FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS
COUNTRY AND I DO -- I PUT
AMERICA FIRST AND EVERYBODY
SHOULD PUT THEMSELVES FIRST.
IT'S NOT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE --
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE PROUD OF
THEIR COUNTRIES BUT WE WERE
PUTTING OUR COUNTRY IN MANY
