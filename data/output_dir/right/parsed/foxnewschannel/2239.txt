IN 2022.
MEANWHILE,.
BRIAN: 25 MINUTES AFTER THE
HOUR.
HERE ON FOX NEWS, THREE
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES IN THE
SENATE RACE SO CRITICAL FACE
OFF A PRIMARY DEBATE.
IN A RACE THAT COULD TIP THE
SENATE'S BALANCE OF POWER
EVEN MORE IN FAVOR OF THE
G.O.P.
AINSLEY: WHAT DO THE VOTERS
THERE THINK, FOX
CORRESPONDENT TODD PIRO IS
LIVE WITH THEM.
HE IS AT THE DINER IN
FAIRMONT, WEST VIRGINIA.
GOOD MORNING, TODD.
>> GOOD MORNING, GUYS.
AS BRIAN SAID, THIS IS A KEY
SENATE RACE.
THEY ARE GOING UP AGAINST
JOE MANCHIN ACTUALLY FROM
FAIRMONT, WEST VIRGINIA.
THE WINNER OF THE REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY.
AND OBVIOUSLY BIG DEBATE
TONIGHT ON THE CHANNEL
AMONGST THOSE THREE
INDIVIDUALS TO DETERMINE WHO
IS THE LEADER HERE IN WEST
VIRGINIA.
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT
KAREN, KAREN IS IN THE OIL
AND GAS INDUSTRY.
SHE SAYS SHE IS ACTUALLY
WAITING FOR TONIGHT'S DEBATE
TO DECIDE WHO SHE IS GOING
TO VOTE FOR.
WHY?
>> BECAUSE, I'M SO UNCERTAIN
ABOUT THE THREE CANDIDATES
I'M NOT WILD ABOUT ANY OF
THEM.
I'M A REPUBLICAN BUT I
ACTUALLY DISAPPOINT
ACTUALLY LISAPPOINT
ACTUALLY LIKAPPOINT
ACTUALLY LIKEPPOINT
ACTUALLY LIKE JOINT
ACTUALLY LIKE JOENT
ACTUALLY LIKE JOE MANCHIN
BETTER THAN THE DEMOCRATS.
TODD: IF THERE WAS A
REPUBLICAN WHO WOULD YOU BE.
>> EVAN JENKINS.
I DON'T LIKE THE OTHER TWO.
I DID CALL A FRIEND IN
SOUTHERN WEST VIRGINIA AND
DID HE HAVE SOME GOOD THINGS
TO SAY ABOUT JENKINS.
TODD: WADE, YOU ARE A SMALL
BUSINESS OWNER YOU SAID YOU
ARE VOTING FOR PATRICK
MORRISEY, WHY?
>> I LIKE THE WORK HE HAS
DONE AS ATTORNEY GENERAL.
HE HAS BEEN VERY
CONSERVATIVE ON E.P.A.
OVERREACH.
HE HAS BEEN GOOD ON THE
SECOND AMENDMENT AND HE HAS
BEEN GOOD AT FIGHTING ON THE
OPIOID CRISIS.
TODD: IN TERMS OF WEST
VIRGINIA, THE ISSUES THAT
MATTER MOST HERE, YOU SAY
JOBS IS NUMBER ONE.
WHY?
>> WELL, IF YOU DON'T HAVE
JOBS, THEN PEOPLE AREN'T
WORKING, AND, YOU KNOW, JOBS
IS IMPORTANT EVERYWHERE.
BUT WE PARTICULARLY NEED
THEM IN WEST VIRGINIA.
TODD: WE WERE TALKING
EARLIER, YOU SAID GOVERNMENT
OVERREACH, REGULATIONS UNDER
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
REALLY DID HURT WEST
VIRGINIA AND YOU FEEL THAT
JENKINS, EXCUSE ME, MORRISEY
IS THE GUY GOING TO GET RID
OF REGULATIONS WHY DO YOU
THINK THAT?
>> AS ATTORNEY GENERAL, HE
FOUGHT AGAINST THOSE
REGULATIONS IN FEDERAL
COURT.
AGAINST THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION AND WAS
SUCCESSFUL.
AND SO I THINK HE WOULD BE A
GOOD CANDIDATE.
ALTHOUGH ULTIMATELY LIKE
KAREN, I THINK JOE MANCHIN
IS THE MAN THAT IS GOING TO
WIN THE ELECTION.
TODD: THAT'S INTERESTING.
I'M GOING TO GO TO GARY
QUICKLY.
GARY, YOU HAD A VERY
INTERESTING TAKE ON THIS
ELECTION.
YOU SAID YOU HAVE THE SAME
FEELING ABOUT JENKINS THAT
YOU DID ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
>> JUST A FEEL GOOD
COMFORTABLE FEELING.
AND FEEL LIKE THOUGHTS MIGHT
IMPROVE THE ECONOMY IN WEST
VIRGINIA AND BRING SOME
JOBS.
IN.
TODD: LIKE WADE YOU SAY JOBS
IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE
FACING WEST VIRGINIA, WHY DO
YOU SAY THAT?
>> I'M RETIRED.
I'M ON A FIXED INCOME, SO
I'M DOING OKAY.
BUT WHEN I DRIVE AROUND AND
SEE PEOPLE, I KNOW THEY ARE
HURTING AND NEED HELP AND
TRAINING IN SOMETHING NEW TO
DO MAYBE SOLAR OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.
TODD: HATS THIS PRESIDENT
HELPED CREATE JOBS.
>> I THINK HE HAS DONE
EVERYTHING RIGHT.
I VOTED FOR HIM.
I HAVE NO REGRETS ABOUT
VOTING FOR HIM.
I FEEL LIKE HE HAS STAND UP
AGAINST ANY WORLD POWER THAT
WOULD THREATEN US.
AND I FEEL LIKE THE STOCK
MARKET IS LIKE BOOMING OUT
OF CREATION AND I FEEL LIKE
IS HE DOING GOOD FOR THE
UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD.
TODD: WITH THAT IN MIND, DO
YOU THINK THE REPUBLICANS
WILL TAKE THE MID TERMS OR
DO YOU LISTEN TO WHAT THE
THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO
>> I CAN'T AGREE WITH THAT I
FEEL AS THOUGH REPUBLICANS
HAVE A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF
MAKING IT.
TODD: GARY, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WE ARE ALSO GOING TO SETTLE
A DEBATE HERE LATER ON.
MOST PEOPLE HERE ARE FOR THE
MOUNTAINEERS OF WEST
VIRGINIA.
BUT WE HEAR ABOUT THE
THUNDERING HERD FOR
MARSHALL.
THUNDERING HERD?
>> YES.
