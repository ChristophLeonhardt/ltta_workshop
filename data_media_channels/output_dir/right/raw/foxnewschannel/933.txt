OUR NEXT GUEST WAS REPORTEDLY A

7
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,100
BIT SURPRISED BY THE PRESIDENT'S

8
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,936
BOLD STEP WITH REGARD TO THE

00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:14,737
JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES WITH

10
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:15,905
SOUTH KOREA.

11
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:17,940
HOW IS HE FEELING TONIGHT?

12
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,142
REPUBLICAN SENATOR MIKE ROUNDS

13
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:20,343

16
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:24,547
>> I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY.

17
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:25,949
>> Shannon: YOU SAID YOU WERE

18
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,450
SURPRISED HE WENT THAT FAR.

19
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,785
SECRETARY POMPEO SAID, TO BE

20
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:29,719
CLEAR, IT IS ONLY PREMISED ON

21
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,387
THE FACT THAT A GOOD

22
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:32,088
NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE, GOOD

23
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:34,057
FAITH NEGOTIATIONS ON BOTH

24
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:35,291
SIDES.

25
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,126
OTHERWISE, THE EXERCISES ARE

26
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:36,559
BACK ON.

27
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,129
YOU HAVE CLARITY ON IT TONIGHT?

28
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:41,898
>> MORE THAN WE DID BEFORE.

29
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:42,732
IT WASN'T CANCELING.

30
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:45,502
WHAT HE'S DOING IS, WE'LL TAKE A

31
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:45,902
BREAK.

32
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:47,537
AND FOR NORTH KOREA, THIS IS A

33
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:48,104
BIG DEAL.

34
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:50,573
FOR US, WE DO THIS ON A REGULAR

35
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:53,877
BASIS, IT'S OUR PRACTICED

36
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:55,478
INVASION OF NORTH KOREA.

37
00:00:55,478 --> 00:00:56,880
AND WE DO THAT WITH SOUTH KOREA.

38
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,715
>> Shannon: WELL, WHEN YOU PUT

39
00:00:58,715 --> 00:00:59,149
IT THAT WAY...

40
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,317
>> WE PARTICIPATE WITH JAPAN AS

41
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:02,118
WELL.

42
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:02,952
FOR NORTH KOREA, THIS WAS

43
00:01:02,952 --> 00:01:04,521
SOMETHING THEY WERE LOOKING AT.

44
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:06,389
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER, THESE CAN

45
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:07,591
BE REINSTATED VERY QUICKLY.

46
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:08,658
AND IT'S JUST LIKE WHEN THERE

47
00:01:08,658 --> 00:01:09,960
WERE PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPING THE

48
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,161
SUMMIT TO BEGIN WITH, THE

49
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:11,928
PRESIDENT COULD STEP BACK AND

50
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:14,364
SAY, THE DEAL IS OFF, WE WANT TO

51
00:01:14,364 --> 00:01:16,366
HAVE THE SUMMIT.

52
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:17,567
ONCE THERE WAS ADDITIONAL

53
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:18,969
DEAL BACK ON AND HAVE IT ON THE

54
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:20,670
SAME DATES.

55
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,972
THE SAME THING CAN OCCUR HERE.

56
00:01:21,972 --> 00:01:24,274
LET'S GIVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE

57
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:25,475
TO SUCCEED.

58
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:27,477
EVERYTHING STARTS WITH A FIRST

59
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:27,777
SET.

60
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:29,546
THIS WAS A FIRST STEP.

61
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,648
IT WAS A VERY GOOD FIRST STEP.

62
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,116
LOTS ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO SOME

63
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:35,318
LEEWAY, LET'S GIVE HIM THE

64
00:01:35,318 --> 00:01:36,953
OPPORTUNITY, TRY TO NEGOTIATE

65
00:01:36,953 --> 00:01:37,687
SOMETHING BESIDES GOING TO WAR.

66
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:38,955
>> Shannon: I WANT TO PLAY A

67
00:01:38,955 --> 00:01:40,624
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT ONE OF YOUR

68
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:42,192
COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE, TOP

69
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:43,126
SENATE DEMOCRATS CHUCK SCHUMER

70
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:44,961
HAD TO SAY ABOUT WHERE WE ARE

71
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:46,296
NOW.

72
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:48,498
>> OUR ADVERSARIES, RUSSIA AND

73
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:50,500
CHINA, HAVE GAINED WHILE I ARE

74
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,335
ALLIES LIKE SOUTH KOREA AND

75
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:53,170
JAPAN, HAVE LOST FOOTING.

76
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,871
AND TO SOME DEGREE OF FAITH IN

77
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:57,474
AMERICA'S RELIABILITY.

78
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:58,775
>> Shannon: WE KNOW THE

79
00:01:58,775 --> 00:01:59,976
SECRETARY POMPEO HAS TALKED TO

80
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:00,944
THE COUNTERPARTS IN SOUTH KOREA

81
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:02,279
AS HE HEADS TO CHINA NOW.

82
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:05,115
DO YOU AGREE WITH MR. SCHUMER'S

83
00:02:05,115 --> 00:02:05,515
ASSESSMENT?

84
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:07,517
>> I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE.

85
00:02:07,517 --> 00:02:09,820
NUMBER ONE, CHINA CLEARLY HAD A

86
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,320
ROLE TO PLAY HERE.

87
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,923
THEY PARTICIPATED.

88
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:14,091
SOUTH KOREA WANTS THIS TO

89
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:14,424
HAPPEN.

90
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:16,293
JAPAN DOES NOT WANT TO BE IN THE

91
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:17,861
MIDDLE OF AN ARMED CONFLICT

92
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:18,328
RIGHT NOW.

93
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:19,530
THEY ARE CLOSER TO NORTH KOREA

94
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,531
THAN WE ARE.

95
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:21,732
THEY RECOGNIZE THEY HAVE

96
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:23,867
MULTIPLE TYPES OF WEAPONS.

97
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:25,236
NORTH KOREA HAS MORE THAN JUST

98
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:27,104
NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THEY HAVE

99
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:27,905
BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS, CHEMICAL

100
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:29,039
WEAPONS AND SO FORTH.

101
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,241
SOUTH KOREA WOULD FEEL THE BRUNT

102
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:30,708
OF IT.

103
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,810
JAPAN IS OF A TARGET AS WELL.

104
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,513
THEY WANT TO SEE THIS

105
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:37,114
PEACEFUL-ALLY RESOLVE.

106
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:39,516
THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE IN OR

107
00:02:39,516 --> 00:02:41,285
GIVE THEM SOMETHING THEY

108
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:42,119
WOULDN'T NORMALLY HAVE.

109
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,287
THIS PRESIDENT, THE OPPORTUNITY

110
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:44,121
TO HAVE MORE THAN JUST WANT TO

111
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:45,589
HAVE COME ALLOW HIM A CHANCE TO

112
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:46,757
GET OUT OF A MESS THAT HAS BEEN

113
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:48,525
CREATED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

114
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:49,560
DECADES, THAT IS WITH THIS

115
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,328
PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO DO.

116
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:52,496
I THINK AMERICA SHOULD BE

117
00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:54,498
SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT IN

118
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:56,367
TERMS OF, LET'S FIND A WAY TO

119
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:57,101
PEACEFULLY GET AROUND THIS.

120
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:58,869
AMERICA JUST DOES NOT GO OUT AND

121
00:02:58,869 --> 00:02:59,503
LOOK FOR WARS.

122
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:02,073
WE TRY OUR BEST TO RESOLVE THEM.

123
00:03:02,073 --> 00:03:03,441
SOMETIMES, BY HAVING A VERY,

124
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:04,442
VERY STRONG OFFENSE AND A VERY

125
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:07,778
STRONG DEFENSE, YOU CAN

126
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:08,913
SOMETIMES CONVINCE SOME OF YOUR

127
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:09,680
ADVERSARIES THAT IT'S BETTER TO

128
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,918
FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION THEN TO

129
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:14,485
CONTINUE TO POKE AT.

130
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,387
>> Shannon: YOU BEEN INVOLVED

134
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,494
INVOLVING OUR SUBMARINE PROGRAM.

00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,629
I WANT TO READ YOU SOMETHING

COMPROMISED THE COMPUTERS OF A

RELATED TO UNDERSEA WARFARE,

SUBMARINES BY 2020."

145
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:45,917
YOU NOW ASK THE NAVY TO EXPLAIN

146
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:46,517
WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

147
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,319
ARE YOU GETTING A BRIEFING?

148
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,487
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?

149
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:51,322
>> WE ASKED FOR THE BRIEFING.

150
00:03:51,322 --> 00:03:53,157
I SERVE AS A SUBCOMMITTEE

151
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:55,793
CHAIRMEN ON CYBER SECURITY FOR

152
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:56,527
THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE.

153
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,929
I ASKED TO FIND OUT WHAT

154
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:59,530
HAPPENED WHY WE HAVEN'T BEEN

155
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,898
ADVISED EARLY ON WHAT THIS

156
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:01,599
LOOKS LIKE.

157
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,600
IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME

158
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,801
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS

159
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:04,168
HAPPENED.

160
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:06,938
WE HAD INFORMATION ON THE F3535

161
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:08,106
BREACH.

162
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:09,307
WE HAD ON A REGULAR BASIS PEOPLE

163
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:10,875
TRYING TO GET INTO OUR SYSTEMS.

164
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,111
IT IS NOT JUST WITHIN THE

165
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:14,913
PENTAGON, IT IS WITHIN THE

166
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:16,281
CONTRACTORS, WITHIN THE CRITICAL

167
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:16,748
INFRASTRUCTURE.

168
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:17,515
THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT DOMAINS

169
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:19,149
IN WHICH YOU CAN GO TO WAR.

170
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,952
AIR, LAND, SEA, SPACE, AND

171
00:04:21,952 --> 00:04:22,353
CYBERSPACE.

172
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:24,622
WHEN IT COMES TO CYBERSPACE, WE

173
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:26,591
ARE BEING ATTACKED EVERY SINGLE

174
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:28,726
DAY, THOUSANDS OF TIMES PER DAY.

175
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,561
OUR SYSTEMS CAN'T SIMPLY

176
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,362
WITHSTAND THAT TYPE OF AN ATTACK

177
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:32,764
ALL THE TIME WITHOUT RESPONDING.

178
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:34,832
WE ARE WORKING OUT NOT ONLY

179
00:04:34,832 --> 00:04:37,902
STRENGTHENING OUR DEFENSES BUT

180
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,103
AS THE DOD ACTUALLY

181
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:41,306
SUGGESTED A YEAR AGO LAST

182
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:43,008
FEBRUARY, WE HAVE TO HAVE A VERY

183
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:44,743
PROMPTED OFFENSE BUT WE ARE NOT

184
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,844
AFRAID TO GO AFTER THESE FOLKS W

185
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:45,877
AFRAID TO GO AFTER THESE FOLKS O

AFRAID TO GO AFTER THESE FOLKS E

188
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:48,213
CONSTANTLY TRYING TO GET INSIDE

189
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:48,947
OF OUR SYSTEMS.
