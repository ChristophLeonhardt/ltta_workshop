BLANKET ON IT.
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN THE
ALTERNATIVE, AND THEY SAID HE
WOULD DO THE OPPOSITE, THE
SO-CALLED EXPERT CLASS.
FANTASTIC, GUYS.
LET'S GET SOME INSIGHT FROM
SOMEONE WITH UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE.
CIA DIRECTOR IN 1994 WHEN
PRESIDENT CLINTON STRUCK A DEAL
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO END
NORTH KOREA'S NUKE PROGRAM.
JIM, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.
WHAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THIS
TIME GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU'VE
WITNESSED OVER THE LAST SEVEN OR
EIGHT MONTHS, THIS PRESIDENT'S
CHILD FROM HIS APPROACH AND WHAT
YOU SAW FROM KIM YESTERDAY.
>> I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
PUT THE NORTH KOREANS UNDER
PRESSURE IN A WAY THAT THEY DID
NOT REMOTELY EXPECT.
HE SORT OF PLAYED GOOD COP-BAD
COP AND THAT HE HAS TAKEN BOTH
ROLES.
SOMETIMES HE'S A GOOD COP AND HE
IS SAYING FRIENDLY LAUDATORY
THINGS ABOUT KIM JONG UN AND
OTHER TIMES, HE'S TALKING ABOUT
FIRE AND FURY AND SO FORTH.
KEEPS HIM OFF BALANCE.
I DON'T THINK THEY HAD A VERY
GOOD IDEA ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH
HIS STYLE OF NEGOTIATING, WHICH
I MUST ADMIT, DID NOT INITIALLY
ATTRACT ME.
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT
INITIALLY ATTRACTED TO IT ARE
BEGINNING TO SEE IT WORK AND
SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AND
SAYING HEY, MAYBE I WAS WRONG ON
THIS MAYBE HE WAS RIGHT.
>> Laura: LEON PANETTA WAS
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT A MONTH AND
A HALF AGO IN MID-APRIL ABOUT
WHAT HE VIEWED THE PRESIDENT TO
BE IN TERMS OF PROVOCATIVE.
WAY TOO PROVOCATIVE IN DEALING
WITH THIS DANGEROUS POWER.
LET'S WATCH.
>> THE WORDS FROM THE
ADMINISTRATION ARE CREATING EVEN
HIGHER VOLUME IN TERMS OF THE
PROVOCATIONS GOING ON.
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL
HERE.
WE SHOULDN'T ENGAGE IN ANY
PRECIPITOUS ACTION.
THERE'S A REASON NO U.S.
PRESIDENT IN RECENT HISTORY HAS
PULLED THE TRIGGER ON
NORTH KOREA.
>> Laura: THAT WAS IN APRIL OF
2017, TO BE CLEAR.
IT'S A YEAR AFTER PLUS A MONTH
OR SO AND HERE WE ARE.
THE BEGINNING OF A FRAMEWORK
THAT WAS RECONFIRMED IN ANOTHER
BRIEF MESSAGE THAT CAME OUT A
FEW HOURS AGO THAT THEY ARE
COMMITTED TO DOING THIS.
WHAT ARE THE PITFALLS ABOUT THIS
ADMINISTRATION GOING FORWARD,
THE ABILITY TO OBVIOUSLY DO
INSPECTIONS AND SO FORTH.
HOW DO WE VERIFY?
>> VERIFICATION IS TOUGH ON
UNDERTAKINGS LIKE THIS.
WE COULD PROBABLY DO IT IF WE
HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF
COOPERATION FROM KIM JONG UN HIS
PEOPLE.
THEY HAVE SIDESWIPED HE EFFORT
TO UNDERTAKE SERIOUS INSPECTIONS
BEFORE THE NORTH KOREANS.
THE IRANIANS WERE EXTRAORDINARY
DUPLICITOUS IN STEERING PEOPLE
AWAY OF ANYTHING THAT WAS
INTERESTING TO LOOK AT.
THEIR AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED
HAPPILY AND THEN TAKEN APART BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THE ONE SITUATION I AM THE MOST
CONCERNED ABOUT, NOT BECAUSE I'M
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE
IT IS SO IMPORTANT, IS CHINA.
WITH A COOPERATIVE CHINA, WILL
WORK THIS OUT.
BUT WITH A CHINA THAT BELIEVES
THAT THEY HAVE TO STAND UP TO US
IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA OR WHAT,
WE COULD STUMBLE HERE.
BUT SO FAR I'VE GOT TO SAY MY
WIFE'S PROGNOSTICATION THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS GOING TO GET
ELECTED AND RULE THE WAY HAS
COME I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
SHE HAD IT RIGHT AND I HAD IT
WRONG.
>> Laura: 
WELL, THAT'S A MAN WE LIKE.
