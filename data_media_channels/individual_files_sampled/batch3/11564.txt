the Sunday Times has provided us all with a little Russian bot deja vu it's groundbreaking investigation with Swansea University has cracked the code on how the Labour Party did so well in this year's general elections and the answer is Russian tweets of course our research suggests there was an orchestrated attempt to propel Corben into Downing Street by bombarding the public with positive messages in support of labour using Twitter accounts that were mostly created after the election was suggested early last year so let's break down that research 6,500 Russian Twitter accounts identified by their primary language work to bash the ruling conservatives and promote the Labour Party in the run-up to the election and a few examples are given as to how they achieve their meddling goals such as promoting stories condemning Tereza may for cuts and police numbers and funding another point made in the article was the massive attendance seen at Corbin's rallies but even if the scores of people who showed up were only there thanks to BOTS retweeting Corbin's location does that somehow make them not true supporters other suspicious activity it was a push by the bots on election day telling people to get out there and vote how dare they the article doesn't provide a list of the accounts they monitored and said that many of them have been deleted or suspended by Twitter Conservative MPs have out to dig further into the claims Russian interference and the politics of the UK is a breach of our election law and something we've got to act to stop where as labor representatives have slammed the article as a classic Sunday Times smear campaign the Labour Party's people-powered election campaign attracted huge levels of public support online we're not aware of any from automated bot categorically did not pay for any and are not aware of any of our supporters doing so other labour supporters have even chosen to embrace the accusations now the report does not comment on who specifically was behind the campaign or how many people actually saw the tweets nor does it say whether or not the attempt was successful but the point is if a vote comes up with shocking results there's clearly no other plausible explanation apart from the Russians did it we asked at the newspaper to comment on the investigation in the meantime former mi5 officer annie National says it's all just part of a clampdown on alternative views the West does not like dissent it does not like alternative views and the Internet offered people the chance of developing these alternative news and as soon as you have one of those alternative viewpoints in the West you must of course be working as one of putin's useful idiots or as a Russian troll bot or whatever it is we saw this last week as well there was a report on Sky News and they were accusing two accounts particularly on Twitter saying that they are Russia Russia BOTS they weren't human beings and so Sky News invited one of these people on to the news and he came on to Sky and argued that he was a human being strangely enough and it turned out he was the sort of 70 year old pensioner who was just angry at what was going on politically in the UK so it's really reasonable that they're trying to stigmatize British citizens you have an alternative view
