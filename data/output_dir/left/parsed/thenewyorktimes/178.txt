Desmond asked me to marry him.
And he’s still incarcerated.
It’s been a year.
Still no sentence. No verdict.
I hate your hurt.
I hate those lies I told you.
I want to marry
you and only you.
I want to look back from the
end of our long life marriage
and say, “Look
where we come from.
Look at what got us here.”
I love you so much, baby.
So much.
Will you honestly,
honestly marry me?
Baby, I want this
with you forever.
Forever lifetime
with you. Only you.
What would it look like to
marry Desmond in prison?
Feeling that you’re alone.
Knowing that you’re alone.
That’s the scary part.
During courthouse
hearings, the sheriff
brings the inmates around back.
It’s hours of them sitting
in a hot bus with only breaks
to use the bathroom.
But I’m always there to
see him, just to wave.
Well, it’s a big day today.
Yeah.
I know you’ve been
coming here a lot.
And I thought maybe — let’s
just take a quick minute
before we go in.
Just talk about what’s
going to happen today.
Today’s a ruling day.
The last couple
times we’ve been in
has been testimony on whether
the evidence that the sheriff’s
department found on
your fiancee as well
as many of his co-defendants
should be admissible.
Right.
So hopefully today
is a good day.
And she determines
that that evidence was
obtained unconstitutionally.
Whether we get a
good or bad ruling,
this thing isn’t
going to end today.
Yeah.
Unfortunately, we’re going
to have to set another date.
O.K.
And probably a trial
date, and probably
a pretrial date, which allows
us to continue negotiations
with the assistant district
attorney in their office.
O.K.
Hopefully get a good — 
an amicable resolution —
Yes.
— to the case.
And hopefully a fast resolution.
Because I know this has
been going on for so long —
Yes.
— with your families.
So let’s walk on up together.
And if you have any questions,
again, just, you know,
let me know, O.K.?
O.K.
All right, let’s go.
Good morning.
Good morning.
How do I see myself?
Attractive.
Beautiful.
Glamorous.
Having a happy glow off of me.
With a cathedral train.
Lots of lace.
Detail.
Pearls, diamonds everywhere.
I want to be able to
say I feel happy.
I’m beautiful in this dress.
I’m sexy in this dress.
I want to be able to smile.
Well, I was coming here to tell
you Saturday me and Desmond
getting married.
 What?
 Girl, why you marrying
a nigger in jail?
What is it about fucking
Desmond that you got to marry
fucking Desmond in jail?
 Kim, stop.
Please stop the hollering.
You can through it
better than your —
 Why, she just said she’s
marrying Desmond in jail.
 What?
Tell me that again?
 She just said she’s marrying
Desmond Saturday
in fucking jail.
 That’s true?
My heart is sad.
For what?
Because I love him.
Because you love him?
 Kimberly.
 That’s all?
If he was a real man,
he’ll tell you, Alone,
I’mma see you when
I get out of here.
Instead, you’re
trying to help him.
You can’t even help your
children and yourself,
trying to help fucking Desmond.
Desmond’s got family.
Come on, Alone.
You got so much going for you.
Why?
You know, love is —
 I don’t have nothing
against nobody incarcerated.
Shit happens to people. Life.
I’ve dealt with that enough.
I saw that enough.
 That’s a bad decision.
What point is it?
What is it going
to do for y’all?
What is it going to do for you?
 
When I was living the way I was living,
I didn’t even know me. Myself.
I hated myself.
I grew up with hatred
in me for a long time.
Long time.
My teachers treated me bad —
I was quiet.
I was smart.
A really good kid.
Hurt me like that.
Then I became a bad child.
My life so fucked
then on out.
Every year.
Every year since I
became a class clown.
Fighting.
Lying.
Doing what I wanted to do.
I don’t want to be without you.
Yes, thank you for calling
Cash Cow, where we say yes.
This is Aloné.
May I help you?
OK, we offer payday, which is
due back on your next payday.
We offer title only if you
have a clear free title
to your vehicle.
You can get a title loan on that.
If you’re looking for a
personal loan, we don’t do that.
That would be a finance company.
You’re welcome, no problem.
Without my mother’s blessings
it was like God’s intervention.
Because on Saturday I was told
the warden denied our request
for a ceremony.
And I thought… now I
have time to think.
This system breaks you apart.
It is designed, just like
slavery, to tear you apart.
And instead of using the
whip, they use mother time.
They use hardships.
They may not hang
you from the tree.
But the experience
itself is just
like when they used to
hang people, but barely
hang them and leave their
feet just tiptoeing around
in the mud, so that they’re
constantly on their tiptoes
fighting for their life.
That is a daily experience when
you are an incarcerated family.
You are hanging on by a
rope, tiptoeing in the mud.
Just trying to get
enough solid dirt
under your feet to still live.
I keep thinking to
myself, what would it mean
to marry someone behind bars?
What would it look like?
Ten years of waving between bars,
gates, courtrooms and lawyers?
I go to bed at night
holding myself.
Not feeling that body heat.
Not getting that human contact.
I have dreams that they
are letting him out.
And then I wake up,
smiling but still sad.
Still alone.
Still in limbo.
And maybe that’s how
it’s going to be for now.
Held by time.
Connected by love,
and love alone.
Who we have become now, by the
power of God, kept us strong
and hate-free, babe.
I love you, babe.
You are my forevermore. 
My wife.
Forever.
