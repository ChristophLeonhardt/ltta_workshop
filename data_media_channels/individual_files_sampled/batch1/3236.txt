I would have been much more aggressive in her bio about how her life is always challenging the status quo how she's been a very kind of change oriented person I hope that we can get more that coming down the stretch I want people to understand that this is a woman I just don't accept things the way that they are I also think that this is a very unique election in that if you think of the macro messaging it's very clear Trump is saying that we can return to some time that we had in America some magical year in 1968 58 I'm not sure what that there's something that this country has lost and it's a different country and we can go back and recapture that well it is a different country and and I think what would she say it is a little less glamorous but by smart policy decisions that we can shape a better future and I think that's very important I think there's a real macro future versus past dynamic that really underlies this election and I hope that they hit that seam and that theme hard
