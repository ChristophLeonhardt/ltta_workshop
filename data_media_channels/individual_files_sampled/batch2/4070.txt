join out by Pennsylvania Republican congressman congressman Ryan Costello and our panel is back Beth John and Zerlina congressman welcome good to be with you Katie so a lot of them lawmakers GOP lawmakers in Congress are pushing back on this the president shouldn't pardon himself as you just saw but why are all the other Moeller attacks being allowed to slide why is Spygate allowed to slide why is memo gate allowed to slide well number one it's hard to keep up with it all right and number two I think that a lot of members of Congress are focused on what they're doing legislatively and are trying to avoid having to weigh in on this on a daily basis some such as myself have weighed in I think that it's been well reported in terms of what congressman Gowdy had to say about this which I subscribe to what his position is and the moment that you do that you're going to get whacked by a lot of Republicans in the process so I think a lot of Republicans probably look in the mirror and say what am I going to get myself into if I just give my honest opinion on what the president tweeted about this morning and then you have to remember the next morning there's gonna be another tweet right I mean the prep this is a street fight and the president is street fighting and weighing in on it too often really probably just put you in the in the middle of the fracas fine weighing in on it too often might put you in the middle of it but then why join in on the street fight and try to take down somebody like trey Gowdy I missed a little bit of the question there by John John Kasich why it's okay why if you don't want to join it on the street fight that's one thing but if if if you and you want to just focus on what you're doing in your your office and in Congress that's fine but then why go after trey Gowdy when he says he saw no evidence that there was any spy in the in the Trump campaign well I agree I don't think members of Congress should be going after congressman Gowdy just for giving his opinion on the matter my point was simply as I agreed with with what chairman Gowdy had to say in terms of it not being Spygate but the other point I would like to make is for a lot of Republicans it becomes in a lot of these districts it becomes very easy to double down and just defend the president all costs because I will say to you even in a district like mine which is probably one of if not the bluest district still on the map there are Republicans all across this country that feel and I watched it was listening to you a little earlier feel that the president's a victim yeah they feel that the president is a victim and so if you are a Republican weighing in on this in in terms of the legitimacy of the investigation and looking at what mr. Giuliani says from time to time on you know he could shoot Comey and pardon him I mean that kind of stuff it's not good I don't subscribe to it but for a lot of Republican members of Congress they look at it and they say what what benefit do I get for weighing in on this even if I might disagree with what the president is doing so we talked about this in the 2:00 p.m. hour I laid out four strategies that the the president seems to be taking in order to discredit the the investigation and protect himself and the last one was what Phil Rucker raised today in the Washington Post that he's has been painting himself as a victim for forever why does that work with Republican voters because we're at a culture war and a polarized political situation and if MSNBC attacks him Republicans are gonna defend them conservatives are gonna like him if you dislike him if this network likes if Fox is good MSNBC and CNN are bad if Samantha bee is bad Trump is good Samantha bee says something nasty about Ivanka Trump Samantha bee is bad that hardens and solidifies Trump supports had time we're living in yeah but it works the other way I mean it's the people defend Samantha bee all I'm saying is the reason that we're in this situation that it works is that's one of the ways you got elected we we are tribes we are now two very much two tribes and you stay with your tribe you stay with your team think about think about a bad player on a football team right you got a player either players team though I know I know you're not making it I know how you're praising it but I'm just saying if you're like a sports fan and there's a close call at second base you support your team it's like saying I want to be fair education of a foreign country meddling into our elections and whether or not that candidate that one was helping in some way or coordinating in some way look at this polling out for Donald Trump among Republicans he commands the second-highest own party approval rating of any president at the 500 day mark since World War two only behind President George Bush w Bush after 9/11 Serleena it's it's almost like they're the facts be damned right because I think that you're right but the problem is is that in the Fox Universe they are not using facts when they're talking about the Russia investigation they're smearing the FBI and saying that there's really Democrats who colluded or that Bob Muller is somehow trying to take down this president even though as we've said many times Bob molars a Republican rod Rosen Singh's a Republican and so in if you turn on Fox News it's a completely different planet in MSNBC world I'd like to say that we use facts even the facts that I don't like right I mean there are times when I even have to say and criticize Samantha B for using foul language and saying that I didn't agree with the use of that word to describe Ivanka Trump but I don't think on Fox News you would see the same thing where they're criticizing people on their own side I think that we do that here a lot more often than they do over there and that's the difference it's a different planet with no facts and each fact that contradicts something that they already think is true it just actually solidifies and validates what they think about in terms of the deep deep state and their own conspiracy but but can I take it out of the realm of the culture war and the Fox versus other media which is certainly the case and that's certainly happening what I worry about and maybe the congressman can address this is the fact that Congress has now completely undermined its role as a co-equal brand that goes way beyond a culture war that goes way beyond Fox News it's something that will live with them for quite some time to come the fact that they have completely abandoned any role of oversight over this presidency even the it over said that we do see going on that the House Intelligence Committee Senate and challenge to me investigations into the Russia meddling has completely broken down on a partisan on a partisan basis nobody trust the outcome of these investigations trey gowdy is retiring he's not even staying he's only allowed to sort of speak his mind now because he's getting the hell out of Dodge congressman what do you think well it is a heavily politicized environment I agree with what was said there but the other thing to remember is we have a Special Counsel investigation where by all accounts there is nothing getting leaked out of the special counsel's office so we have one side utilizing their own set of facts or their own hypotheticals the other side doing the same and then they're fighting one another all the while and investigation is ongoing I don't I think it's rather premature for Congress to step out and say this is what we now need to do while the investigation is still pending well let's take it out of the investigation framing and put it into just the the laws that are being passed and the I don't know in tariffs look at a listen to John Kasich yesterday on one of the sunday shows I have been frankly shocked at the fact that our leaders think they got it they have to ask permission from the President to do anything this is very foreign to me it's alien to me when you are elected to the United States Senate or the United States House of Representatives you have a duty to represent your district but most important represent your country not to just be thinking about your political party he's talking about the lack of pushback legislatively for Donald Trump's tariffs which Republicans don't agree with there's also the an immigration debate that just cannot happen because the Republicans won't send the president a bill that he refuses to sign well I may be the wrong person to ask because I do a fair amount of pushing back I voted for Kasich in the primary I think number one on the tariffs issue you're hearing a lot of Republicans speak out against what the president is just legislation then why just well we do have a bill that's in the Senate we have not introduced a house companion that would not allow the president to go forth with imposing tariffs without Congress first giving an up or down vote on that on the immigration issue we're five votes short of and I'm signed on to this forcing a bipartisan to bein on the House floor where the president will be able to put his bill on the floor we have and we have a more conservative House bill we have a more centrist House bill and then the Democrats would be able to put a bill on the floor I think we should do more of that I think we should have more bipartisan debates on the floor and that would be in some respects it's a push back to what the president is is not doing on immigration in another respect I think it's actually consistent with the the roundtable that he had in the Oval Office saying yeah let's get an immigration deal done with a Democrat sitting in the room so I think it was just a photo-op well I'm sad to say that I think it was - because nothing's happened yet I would like to see the president lean in and demonstrate some leadership on the immigration issue there are there are instances where you do see a Republican push back in the house in the Senate but back to John's point this is a deeply divided country and it does get back to cultural issues I do genuinely believe that and I've found myself very very frustrated because you know we have the right we have the left but we do have a center and I think a lot of folks in the center don't know what to believe and what they end up doing is sort of sitting back and waiting for it all to play out and then B and then judging it after the fact right rather than leaning in and debating it in real time because they look around and those who are most fervent are the are the left and the right and you get your head chopped off if you're in the middle trying to balance things out and use some common sense just my - that's my two cents I don't disagree sir congressman Costello thank you very much hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our
