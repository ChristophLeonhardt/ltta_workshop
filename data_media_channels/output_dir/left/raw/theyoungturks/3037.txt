1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,570
>>OMAROSA IS LEAVING THE WHITE
HOUSE.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,200
THE WHITE HOUSE IS SAYING THAT
SHE IS LEAVING BECAUSE HER YEAR

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,620
IS UP AND SHE HAS DECIDED THAT
SHE WANTS TO MOVE ON TO

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,080
OTHER THINGS.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,940
THERE ARE SOME REPORTS
INDICATING THAT SHE HAS

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,180
BEEN FIRED.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:29,980
LET'S GET TO THOSE REPORTS.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:37,611
APPARENTLY SHE WORKED IN THE
COMMUNE OCCASIONS DEPARTMENT, I

9
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:40,110
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,690
REALLY DID, BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND
THOSE FRUSTRATIONS BUT I

11
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,739
COULD'VE PREDICTED THOSE
FRUSTRATIONS BEFORE TRUMP

12
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:49,320
WAS EVER EVEN ELECTED.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,329
I WOULD HAVE PREDICTED THOSE
FRUSTRATIONS IF I WAS ON

14
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:55,989
THE SHOW THE APPRENTICE.

15
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,790
BUT SHE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF TRUMP
AND WAS IN FAVOR OF THE WAY HE

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,670
SPOKE ABOUT CERTAIN COMMUNITIES,
ESPECIALLY THE BLACK

17
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,320
COMMUNITY WHEN SHE DECIDED TO
URGE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR HIM

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,119
AND THEN WENT ON TO WORK IN THE
WHITE HOUSE.

19
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:11,119
SORRY.

20
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,929
>> THERE ARE TWO SIDES.

21
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:23,310
I WILL TELL YOU THE SIDE THAT IS
NOT CORRECT, OMAROSAS.

22
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,310
SHE SAYS

23
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,329
THAT SHE WAS TEMPTED TO QUIT
AFTER THE WAY DONALD TRUMP

24
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,469
HANDLED THE NEO-NAZI RALLIES.

25
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:33,670
WHAT YOU MEAN YOU'RE TEMPTED?

26
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,860
WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT?

27
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,860
YOU

28
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,240
WEREN'T TEMPTED, YOU GOT FIRED
SO YOU ARE TRYING TO SAVE FACE

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,859
AND PRETEND YOU ARE AGAINST ALL
HIS OBNOXIOUS POLICIES WHEN

30
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,270
I SAW YOUR ASS ON TELEVISION
DEFENDING HIM DAY AFTER DAY.

31
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,270
WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?

32
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:55,759
WHAT A LIAR YOU ARE, NO WONDER
YOU AND TRUMP WORKED TOGETHER.

33
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:03,499
>>APRIL RYAN WHO IS FROM THE
AMERICAN URBAN RADIO NETWORK,

34
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:07,779
WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY LOVE FOR
OMAROSA.

35
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:20,430
>>THEY USED TO BE FRIENDS WHICH
I WAS SURPRISED BY.

36
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,170
>> RYAN ALSO GOT A TIP FROM AN
ANONYMOUS SOURCE, SOMEONE FROM

37
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:59,750
THE WHITE HOUSE HERE IS WHAT SHE
HAD TO SAY VIA TWITTER.

38
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,829
I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE IT.

39
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:03,349
>>ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

40
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,760
THERE IS NOW MORE REPORTS COMING
OUT.

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,020
SHE APPARENTLY TRIED TO ENTER
THE PRIVATE RESIDENCE.

42
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,370
SOMEBODY WARNED GENERAL KELLY.

43
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:20,170
THAT IS WHEN THEY CALL THE
SECRET SERVICE AND ESCORT

44
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:26,840
HER OUT OF THE BUILDING.

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,230
THIS IS A PERFECT ENDING FOR
HER.

46
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,680
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME SHE
HAS BEEN FIRED BY TRUM, THE

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
THIRD TIME.

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:46,549
SHE WAS FIRED AND THE OTHER TWO
APPRENTICE SHOWS.

49
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:54,310
SO HE HAS ALREADY FIRED HER 
A

50
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,310
COUPLE OF TIMES AND HE DOES IT

51
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:03,439
IN HIS THIS CASE.

52
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,150
BEING DRAGGED OUT OF THE WHITE
HOUSE, PERFECT.

53
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,299
AND THEN COMING ON CAMERA AND
LYING ABOUT IT.

54
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:17,260
HE OR SHE IS TELLING THE PRESS I
WAS PLANNING TO RETIRE OR

55
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,329
RESIGN ANYWAY.

56
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:26,450
>>MY FAVORITE RIDICULOUS
ARGUMENT COMING FROM HER AND

57
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,980
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS IS HER
ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY WAS COMING

58
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,830
UP SO SHE DECIDED IT IS GOOD
ENOUGH.

59
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,830
>>OTHER OPPORTUNITIES?

60
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,880
WHAT
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES?

61
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,630
>> WHO WORKS FOR A PLACE A YEAR,
HAPPENS TO LIKE IT, BUT IN

62
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,780
THAT WHEN YOUR ANNIVERSARY COMES
UP AND SAYS TIME TO MOVE ON?

63
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:57,750
>>YOU ARE A REALITY SHOW GUEST,
AND THE NEW MAGICALLY WOUND

64
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,780
UP AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE YOU
HAVE NO BUSINESS AT ALL.

65
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:21,280
>>IT IS JUST SO DUMB.

66
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:33,600
>>ANYONE WHO BELIEVED HER IN THE
FIRST PLACE IS A JACKASS.

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,330
>>HOW DO YOU FIRE SOMEONE TWICE
AND HIRE THEM TO WORK IN THE

68
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,180
WHITE HOUSE?

69
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,990
>> SHE IS A REALITY SHOW GUEST
AND IT IS PREPOSTEROUS THAT

70
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,430
SHE IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

71
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,120
BUT THE GUY IN CHARGE OF THE
WHITE HOUSE IS A REALITY

72
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
SHOW HOST.

73
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,470
WE ARE ALL LIVING IN THIS INSANE
REALITY SHOW.

74
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,880
TRUMP TOLD HIS STAFF LAST WEEK
TO TREAT EVERY DAY LIKE A TV

75
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:07,130
SHOW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO
WIN.

76
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,280
>> [CLOWN MUSIC]

77
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:21,340
>> ARE YOU SURPRISED YOU HAVE A
CLOWN OF 

78
00:06:21,340 --> 00:00:00,000
THE WHITE HOUSE?
