HE MADE US REALIZE IF YOU HAVE A
HELPING HAND, YOU WILL FIND ONE
AT THE END OF YOUR ARM.
>> JOINING ME NOW IS THE BRITISH
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. AND WE'RE
HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY.
WE'LL CERTAINLY TALK ABOUT THE
ROYAL WEDDING AS SHEP SMITH
TEASED.
I WANT TO START WITH THE NEWS.
THAT ASSAD HAS TRAVELED TO
RUSSIA.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO FIRST ASK
WHY PRESIDENT PUTIN THINKS IT'S
A GOOD IDEA TO HOST SOMEONE WHO
HAS GASSED HIS OWN PEOPLE, WHO
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH HUGE
DISPLACEMENT, HALF MILLION
SYRIANS DEAD AS A RESULT OF THE
CIVIL WAR.
EXTRAORDINARY THING TO DO.
>> Dana: IT WAS JUST THIS WEEK
THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY
WAS VERY CLEAR WITH THE RUSSIANS
ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN YOUR
OWN COUNTRY TO RUSSIAN NATIONALS
THAT WERE LIVING THERE.
>> YES, THERE'S A TRACK RECORD
HERE OF RUSSIANS ACTUALLY USING
NERVE AGENTS AGAINST PEOPLE ON
FOREIGN SOIL AND VERY STRONG
INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO THAT
MESSAGE HASN'T GOTTEN THROUGH
WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DONE.
>> Dana: CERTAINLY THE UNITED
STATES AND THE U.K. HAVE A
SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP.
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S NOT WITHOUT
TENSION.
AND OBVIOUSLY, IET  -- THE IRAN
DEAL IS ONE OF THOSE.
WHERE DO THINGS GO HERE?
>> IT'S ONE OF A CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP.
ONE OF THE ASPECTS IS WHEN YOU
HAVE DISAGREEMENTS YOU CAN
DISCUSS THEM OPENLY AND FRANKLY
AND TRY TO FIND A WAY FORWARD.
WE WOULD LIKE TO RETAIN THE
JCPOA OR THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL
PROVIDED THAT THE IRANIANS STAY
IN COMPLIANCE.
THE PRIME MINISTER MET THE
GERMAN CHANCELLOR AND THE FRENCH
PRESIDENT YESTERDAY.
AND THAT'S THEIR POSITION, TOO,
AND THAT WAS THE SUBSTANCE OF
THE JOINT STATEMENT.
THE DISAGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED
STATES NOT ABOUT OBJECTIVES
BECAUSE WE ALL SHARE THE SAME
OBJECTIVES BUT ABOUT MEETINGS
AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT
CONCERN THE UNITED STATES LIKE
THE BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM OR
IRAN'S REGIONAL ACTIVITIES IN
LEBANON AND SYRIA, IN YEMEN,
ABSOLUTELY SHARE THESE CONCERNS
SO WE WANT TO WORK ON THOSE, ON
ADDRESSING THOSE WHILE KEEPING
THE JCPOA, MAYBE WE CAN WORK
WITH THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION ON
THOSE AREAS NOW.
>> Dana: DO YOU THINK IT'S
POSSIBLE THAT THE U.K. AND
OTHERS WOULD HELP THE UNITED
STATES IN TIGHTENING SANCTIONS
AGAINST IRAN?
>> I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION FOR
THE FUTURE AND WE HAVE TO SEE,
FIRST OF ALL, HOW THE SANCTIONS
UNFOLDS.
I SHOULD BE CLEAR IN SAYING THAT
WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE DEAL, WE
ARE NOT -- NOT THE U.K., NOT OUR
EUROPEAN PARTNERS WE IMPOSE
SANCTIONS IRAN.
WE'RE INTENDING TO KEEP TO THE
DEAL WHICH IS MEANT TO STOP THE
IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM BUT ALSO
TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE
SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN.
>> Dana: IS ANY OF THAT GOING TO
COLOR THE DISCUSSIONS ON TRADE
THAT THE EUROPEANS ARE HAVING
WITH THE UNITED STATES?
NOT JUST CHINA AND NAFTA BUT
THERE'S THIS ISSUE GOING IN
FRONT OF THE E.U.?
>> YEAH, WE HOPE NOT.
WE HAVE AN EXEMPTION AS THE
EUROPEAN UNION ON THE MEASURES
ON STEEL I THINK UNTIL THE END
OF THIS MONTH.
WE WOULD LIKE A PERMANENT
EXTENSION.
WE ARE TALKING TO THE
ADMINISTRATION NOW.
TALKING TO THE ADMINISTRATION
ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO GRANT
THAT PERMANENT EXTENSION.
WE HOPE WE CAN FIND A WAY
FORWARD.
I MEAN, THE -- THESE MOVES --
THIS DISPUTE IS BASED ON
NATIONAL SECURITY AND WE'RE VERY
STRONG NATIONAL SECURITY
PARTNERS OF THE U.S.
SO IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO ASK
THAT THIS SHOULD BE DIRECTED
AGAINST THE U.K.
>> Dana: IN THE MEANTIME, YOU
HAVE SOME EXCITING NEWS
HAPPENING OVER IN THE U.K.
SHEPHERD SMITH IS THERE FOR THE
ROYAL WEDDING.
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT AMERICANS
ARE SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS
NUPTIALS ON SATURDAY?
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
BEFORE YOU COME HERE, YOU HEAR
HOW FASCINATED AND ENTHUSIASTIC
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ABOUT
OUR ROYAL FAMILY.
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE HERE TO
EXPERIENCE IT.
AND THERE'S EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL
OF INTEREST AND ENTHUSIASM.
THERE'S, OF COURSE, SOMETHING
SPECIAL ABOUT THIS ONE WHICH IS
THAT PRINCE HARRY WHO IS A MUCH
