Laura: THE ANTI-TRUMP KAVANAUGH RESISTANCE LOOKS LIKE A PROGRESSIVE MENTAL DISORDER. POST KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION SYNDROME. FIRST, LINDA SARSOUR CONDUCTED THE FIRST CONFIRMATION SERIES, AND THEN BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS ACCUSED OF RAPE, THEN FLASHING HIS PRIVATE PARTS. THEN ACCUSED BASICALLY OF GANG RAPE. THEN RADICALS CORNERED JEFF FLAKE IN AN ELEVATOR AND THEN, KAVANAUGH WAS ACCUSED OF BASICALLY BEING AN ALCOHOLIC, AND HAVING ANGER ISSUES, AND WHEN ALL THAT FAILED, A MOB OF CRAZY EYED PROTESTERS SMASHED AND CLAWED AT THE SUPREME COURT DOORS AND WAIVED FILTHY SIGNS. DEMOCRATS PROMISED IMPEACHMENT AND TO ABANDON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, FINALLY TO PACK THE COURT TO OFFSET THE FIVE CONSERVATIVES ON THE BENCH. JOINING US NOW WITH REACTION TO THIS TRAGIC DISORDER, VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, AUTHOR OF THE BOO BOOK, YOU'VE HEARD OF INFLAMMATORY BALL DISEASE, THIS IS AN INFLAMMATORY ANTI-KAVANAUGH TRUMP MADNESS. HAVE THEY EVER BEEN THIS FAR LEFT OR THIS MUCH UNHINGED? I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK YOU CAN TRACE IT FROM 2009 THROUGH 16 WHEN OBAMA PROMISED THEM THAT A NEW DEMOGRAPHY, IMMIGRATION AND IDENTITY POLITICS, THE SYSTEM WAS GEARED FOR THAT. THE HOUSE AND SENATE, AND OUT OF THAT FRUSTRATION, THEY THINK BIG MONEY. AT THE PARTY OF THE RICH NOW, SILICON VALLEY, WALL STREET, MAYBE THEY WILL LIKE THAT SPECTACLE. AND, MOB THEM, SHOUT THEM DOWN, GET RID OF DUE PROCESS. THEY ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE SYSTEM THAT USED TO BE GREAT BETWEEN 2009 AT 16, AND SUDDENLY IS ANTIDEMOCRATIC. NONE FROM WYOMING, THERE ARE TOO FEW PEOPLE THERE. LET'S GO BACK TO 1869 BEFORE WE HAD ADDITIONAL NUMBERS OF SUPREME COURT JUDGES. IT'S KIND OF A NICHE AND DESIRE FOR POWER, AND A LOT OF THESE DILEMMAS WERE SELF-INFLICTED. THEY WERE THE ONES WHO WERE TURNED OFF THE MIDDLE CLASS AND INDEPENDENCE, THE WHITE WORKING CLASS AND THE SWING STATES. Laura: SO WHAT ARE THEY BANKING ON? , SHE WAS ASKED ON MSNBC, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO BASICALLY ONCE YOU GET ELECTED? IT'S REALLY ABOUT ORGANIZING AND REALLY THINKING ABOUT THAT WORD, ORGANIZING. BEING STRATEGIC IN THEIR ACTION ACTIONS, AND REALLY BRINGING TOGETHER A COHESIVE STRATEGY OF PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE CHAMBER INSTEAD OF ONLY FOCUSING ON THE PRESSURE IS INSIDE THE CHAMBER. THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING. MY FAVORITE AREAS, THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING THOUGHT. WHILE I DON'T KNOW. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO CRITICIZED DONALD TRUMP AND SAID HE HAS THE VOCABULARY OF 1500 WORDS, BUT HE'S A SOPHISTICATED ARTICULATE. BUT THIS IS BOSTON UNIVERSITY, WHAT, FOURTH IN THE CLASS. AND THEY START JUDGING PEOPLE BY THEIR ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR THEIR IDEOLOGY, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GET IT. IT'S KIND OF SAD THAT THE DEMOCRATS WERE GOING DOWN. THEY OCTOGENARIANS, FEINSTEIN, BIDEN AND PELOSI, THEY ARE SO DESPERATE TO BE HIP AND GET BACK TO PARTIES, AND IS SAYING HE'S GOING TO BEAT TRUMP UP OUTSIDE OF THE LOCKER ROOM OR SOMETHING OR FEINSTEIN HAS THIS BUSY TEAM SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE CAVANAUGH K SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE CAVANAUGH V SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE CAVANAUGH N SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE CAVANAUGH U SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE CAVANAUGH H WITH THE TESTIMONY. IT'S PATHETIC THAT SOMEONE HIJACKED THEIR PARTY AND THEY ARE KIND OF DEER IN HEADLIGHTS. THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO BE HIP AND GO HARD LEFT OR SUFFER THE IRRELEVANCE OF BEING OLD AND IN THE WAY. Laura: WHEN I WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE, AND, IT'S PROBABLY A PRETTY DECENT ONE. OBVIOUSLY, THEY HAD ANOTHER SUPPORT OPENING. BUSH STAFF SECRETARY , AND VERY MAINSTREAM. PERSON AND IT JUDGE. SO CAN YOU IMAGINE IF RUTH BADER GINSBURG IS SUDDENLY OPEN, AND WHAT WILL THEY DO THEN? BILL MARR AS SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE A RIGHT TO APPOINT ANYONE ELSE. I THINK BY NOMINATING KAVANAUGH FIRST, HE SAID IF YOU WERE WITH BUSH, YOU WENT TO THE RIGHT SCHOOLS AND YOU COULD BE CARICATURED AS A PREPPY. JUST THINK WHAT THEY WILL DO TO THE NEXT THAT IS IN FURTHER TO THE RIGHT? AND WHEN SHE IS NOMINATED, HE CAN JUST SAY LOOK. IT'S NOT HER, NOT ANYBODY. AND IT'S 90% OF THAT SMALL RUBRIC, AND I WILL TAKE DONALD TRUMP IN THE REPUBLICAN.
