APPARENTLY NEARLY ONE IN
FIVE AMERICANS THINK THAT
INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE IS MORALLY
CORRUPT.
ACCORDING TO A POLL THAT
ASKED AMERICANS ABOUT THINGS
THAT THEY THOUGHT WERE
ACCEPTABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE,
ALMOST 20% OF AMERICANS SAY THAT
INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE 
IS
UNACCEPTABLE.
NOW THERE IS A PARTY DIVIDE
THERE.
THERE WASN'T MUCH OF A
DIFFERENCE AMONG RESPONDENTS BY
RACE WHICH IS INTERESTING, BUT:
LOTS 
OF INTERESTING THERE, BUT
IT 
IS INTERESTING, PEOPLE WHO
THOUGH
INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE IS MORALLY
WRONG IS WAY HIGHER THAN I
THOUGHT.
I'VE SEEN THOSE RESULTS
IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES IN
ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI WHERE 21
AND 29% THOUGHT, REPUBLICAN AND
VOTERS, THOUGHT INTERRACIAL
MARRIAGE SHOULD BE ILLEGAL, SO I
KNEW THAT IDEA EXISTED, I JUST
DID NOT KNOW IT WAS THIS LARGE
AND THEN, IS IT SURPRISING THAT
MORE REPUBLICANS THINK THAT?
OF COURSE NOT.
BUT 12% OF DEMOCRATS
WHO THINK THAT IT IS
MORALLY WRONG AND I AM GOING
AWAY BY THAT AND THEN WHEN
THEY SHOWED THE BREAKDOWN I WAS
LIKE ALL RIGHT, THAT IS AN
INTERESTING POINT, NOT ONLY
WHITES BUT BLACKS AND
LATINOS, SOME OF THEM THINK IT
IS MORALLY WRONG.
I AM DISHEARTENED BY THAT AS
WELL.
LOOK, EASY FOR ME TO SAY, I AM
IN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE AND I
HAVE BEEN A NONSTOP INTERRACIAL
RELATIONSHIPS AND I GREW UP
IN A MULTIRACIAL WORLD IN NEW
JERSEY AND SO I AM BLOWN AWAY BY
THE IDEA OF PEOPLE THINKING IF
IT IS A DIFFERENT RACE, YOU
SHOULD NOT BE IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH THEM.
I LITERALLY CANNOT COMPREHEND
IT.
WHY?
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
ALSO YOU ARE A MORAL ATHEIST.
I THINK THE SMALL PARTS OF THE
OTHER RACES BELIEVE THAT ARE
ALSO SOME OF THE ONES THAT WILL
THINK, I DO NOT WANT NECESSARILY
WANT MY FAMILY MEMBER TO
MARRY SOMEONE OF ANOTHER
RACE THAT THEY THOUGHT HAVE
OPPRESSED THEM, SOME OF TIMES
THAT IS THE THING WITH THE
MINORITY.
YOU DON'T END UP IN A SITUATION
BECAUSE IT IS BAD FOR YOU, WHICH
ARE ALSO WRONG, BE WITH WHO
YOU WANT AND BE HAPPY BUT
THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE REASONS
I'M COMPLETELY GUESSING.
WHAT IS INTERESTING THOUGH,
THE THING THAT IS REALLY
SHIFTING THE MINDSET ABOUT
INTER-RACIAL RELATIONSHIPS
AND MARRIAGES IS ACTUALLY ONLINE
DATING APPS.
THAT 
IS ONE POSITIVE DEFINITELY
FROM DATING APPS.
I AM IN THE SAME BOAT AS YOU,
I AM IN AN INTERRACIAL
RELATIONSHIP NOW AND I HAVE BEEN
THROUGHOUT MY LIFE, AND SO
IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME.
IT IS A LOGICAL, BUT I
UNDERSTAND.
IF YOU ARE IN ONE SOCIAL CIRCLE
AND NOTHING BEYOND THAT,
HOW YOU MIGHT BE CONFUSED, RAY?
YOU JUST MIGHT BE A LITTLE
CONFUSED.
I GET THAT THERE IS A GROUP
OF FOLKS WHO MIGHT THINK ALONG
THE LINES OF WHAT JR POSTULATED
THERE AND IT IS NOT LIKELY
HAVE NOT HEARD FOR EXAMPLE,
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN
SAYING BLACK GUYS SHOULD NOT GET
MARRIED TO WHITE WOMEN.
IT IS OUT THERE, SOME FOLKS DO
SAY THAT.
AGAIN, I DO NOT AGREE WITH THAT,
BUT OVERALL, IS IT MORE OF
A CONSERVATIVE THINK WESTERN
YES.
LOVING VERSUS VIRGINIA WAS ONLY
ABOUT 50 YEARS AGO.
UNTIL JUST 50 YEARS AGO BLACK
AND WHITE PEOPLE WERE NOT
ALLOWED TO GET MARRIED TO ONE
ANOTHER AND SOME OF OUR
STATES, SO DOES THE CULTURE
STILL REMAIN?
IT REMAINS SO MUCH SO THAT ONLY
20%
OF REPUBLICANS AND RIGHT-WING
REPUBLICANS THOUGHT THE
INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE WAS EVEN A
GOOD THING.
ONLY 28%.
WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS I GUESS.
BUT VERY SLOWLY.
