I've been keeping a very close eye on this power grab by Democrats in Pennsylvania that has resulted in a massive gerrymandering scheme that will read district the state from the 2011 map now you know Scott you and ger former CIA station chief is one of my go-to experts on all things intelligence he also is a congressional candidate in Pennsylvania now I used to introduce him as a candidate in Pennsylvania's 15 congressional district but right now we really don't know where Scott is gonna be a candidate because the case is resting with Justice Alito that's right even as we speak exactly the United States Supreme Court so Scott we discussed this so the the situation in Pennsylvania for the audience members that don't understand we have a map that was drawn in 2011 let's rest on the 2010 census that's right Democrats in the state said this is no longer fair that's right even though in 2020 we're gonna have a new census presumably because they wanted to pick up seats at the midterms that's right they want Surrey district to where it was more democratic it's more in favor of Democrat voters publicans challenged it went to the state Supreme Court in pencils by where they won in a four to three that's right I mean it's all it's all part of Eric Eric this is a master program of Eric Holder and some some big people who are trying to do this in a variety of states if Eric hold Eric Holder former attorney general under Obama how does he factor into this um I don't know I don't have the exact facts however he is he is one of the leading faces of this this movement to bring lawsuits in almost every single state having to do with gerrymandering so he's one of the attorneys yes and he's one of the advisors of like of a larger movement that's dedicated to doing this in a variety of dist riot ii of states which means that if this is successful in pennsylvania stay tuned folks because it's good wind up happening in your state as well so the obama administration went when republicans when conservatives say the obama administration is still trying to control politics in the united states that's right it's not hyperbole no it's not his former attorney general is actively litigating that is trill change the the political complexities that when to trump in the 2016 let's right I believe that there's a case right now I believe it's um it's North Carolina that's being is in the is in the UH is currently in the courts and if I'm not mistaken there's also a similar case in Wisconsin and this is this is led by the name of the organization escapes me but it is spearheaded by Eric Holder and some other now isn't this very very interesting today President Trump spoke you heard the speech he specifically discussed Pennsylvania in North Carolina and Wisconsin as places the Democrats thought they had in the bank and failed and here you go Eric Holder is initiating lawsuits it's exactly right right that is and that is not a coincidence right now and now the president has last week the president tweeted something about the Pennsylvania redistricting because I think now he's beginning to understand as our other people across the country that this is this isn't important this is an important case because this is this is the Democrats trying to reclaim through the courts through activist courts what they could not gain through convincing the voters now the case right now at rest its wrestling with Justice Alito in the Supreme Court that's right what is what why is it there what are we waiting for him to decide Justice Alito I guess is the point man for deciding a very short very short notice cases that must be sought that must be dealt with very quickly and given the fact that petition signing is must occur actually by next week we really are very much running out of time you say petition signing it what in what context what are these petitions petition petition signing is something that candidates across the United States must do if they're seeking election if you're running for Congress in any state you must get 1000 signatures of people within your district that sign basically they certify you as a kid want this guy this girl as a candidates right doesn't mean you have to vote for him but you but you're you're giving your signature it takes on electoral signature petition that's right and those are next Tuesday that's right so justice Alito's clock is ticking very much so I mean in fact I would almost expect the four days I would always expect a ruling by Alito at the end of today I was actually expecting it because I know he was given it maybe yesterday afternoon and now what he's literally are down to the wire now if I'm if correct me if I'm wrong but we're just leaders looking at is the map that was submitted because the governor rejected the map submitted by the Democratic state legislature well by the republican-controlled legislature I'm sorry the Democratic governor my mistake thank you the Republican governor rejected the Democratic governor rejected the map submitted by the Republican let that's right the court and told them submit another they didn't in time the court redrew it that's right submitted it to the governor that's right now there's a challenge on that that's right if Justice Alito either refuses to hear it or uphold the map and there are new districts that's right and then and then then that's what we have to live with that's right the redistricting will then occur so you were in the 15th where would you be with the new map I would be my my basically one an idea behind the behind one idea behind the gerrymandering is to is to basically keep congressional districts more within county lines and so this map does that however I must also say that the map submitted by the Republican legislature also did this in other words both new maps are better than what we had before so in other words when we see those maps of congressional districts that looked like these in Saenz thank you also the clown eating a grape or whatever it's weird and they're touching six counties and that's right above those counties of slivers this tries to make it more uniform that's right and so two or three counties the breadth and should give an example I live in a county called Berks County in Berks counties fairly large trapezoidal shades but under the old system it actually it was subdivided into four different districts Wow under the prison under the under the new one that the Democrats are submitting it's simplified to two districts so Berks County goes from having two congressional representatives from four to two that's right exactly and so we expect Justice Alito what's what's the general sentiment with the experts you're speaking to legal experts Lily will be map submitted by the state Supreme Court he upheld actually we believe we believe that they will be it will be upheld in other words we will be dealing with a new map very shortly before an election which is almost unprecedented in terms of the time frame unprecedented in the history of Pennsylvania certainly well this tells us that Republicans have to get very very serious about an aggressive fight in the midterms exactly very much so Pennsylvania especially is endangered Pennsylvania has 18 congressmen and for 13 there is a currently 1313 Republicans and five Democrats and it's projected that perhaps we can lose perhaps up to two seats in a new election in the present new districts so it's gonna be a little bit of a battle it can be hard but a really necessary fight Scott yelling dirty was a congressional candidate and Pennsylvania's 15th congressional district but by this evening he might be one in their night shadows always my friend thanks for being here thank you very much you
