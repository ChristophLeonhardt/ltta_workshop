we are on a family trip to Los Angeles
where I'll be attending VidCon maybe
seeing my in-laws this videos gonna
start a little experiment wherein I try
to get my new boosted mini on an
airplane my theory here is that the
reason why they don't allow these is
because of the battery so I'm gonna try
to circumvent that rule by removing the
battery taking the battery in the
skateboard on separate
back at the airport again
so far so good
sorry right now I'm putting my odds at
about 50/50 of this skateboard comes
through will sit thank you
I got it by some miracle I got it
easy five and a half hour flight no
napping for me and he had a little bit
of work done
long as the baby isn't freaked out
she's a good mom I just talk I'd like to
be the first to lock me down like Holly
X International Airport the local time
is about 11

Los Angeles
I haven't even posted a video on a week
I haven't edited a video in a week let
me try to explain what happened here see
shortly after we got to LA well I kind
of got this stomach ache this stomach
pain and it turned out it was a big deal
I had to go to the hospital I'm gonna
make a whole nother video about my time
in the hospital but it threw off
everything it threw off me going to
VidCon it threw off the shoot I was
supposed to do it kind of screwed up
everything and now well now it's like
six days six days since I left New York
City Candace and Francine already back

good week here

surprise top secret it is top secret
