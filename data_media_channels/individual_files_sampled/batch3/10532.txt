police brutality in America making headlines again after body cam footage was recently released showing an officer fatally shooting an unarmed man the incident took place in the state of Arizona it was last year the awarding you may find this recently released a video now police were called to the hotel after it was reported that a man had been seen pointing a gun out of his window there the weapon was actually an air rifle at the victim 26 year-old Daniel shaver had been drinking with friends in his hotel room and he was showing them as air rifle which a witness thought may have been a lethal weapon well Mark Geragos who is representing the victim's family said it's the most horrific shooting he's ever seen but a jury acquitted the officer of murder and manslaughter charges just last Thursday human rights activist Randy short believes the officers claims that he felt threatened don't quite hold up burst informal said officer was with the group of other people with guns there was no way that that man even if he had a weapon was going to be able to overcome that many people with body armor with high powered automatic weaponry it is a fantasy and a a sick joke that the officer claimed the fear for his life it was excessive force it was an execution I believe that many officers are psychologically unstable they're dangerous people and essentially they have a license to kill
