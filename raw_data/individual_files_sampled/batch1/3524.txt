after I got out of office I taught at Harvard and I taught in the John F Kennedy School of Government one of my classes was how pro wrestling prepares you for politics and everybody chuckled when they heard it Pro Wrestling teaches you okay my job as a villain was to piss people off so bad they would spend their hard-earned money to come and see me get beat well what's the difference between that and asking them for a vote in fact voting's easier it doesn't hit their wallet second when you're in a match Murphy's Law we shows up anything that can go wrong will you have to be able to think on your feet you have to be able to keep this match operating to the entertainment level that has to be at for the wrestling fan so in politics you're going to get questions as gary johnson did you're not may be prepared for at the moment so you've got to be able to think on your feet quickly just like wrestling finally you're comfortable in front of a mic in front of a TV camera you communicate it's about communication and you have to have that in wrestling they used to say the money's made at the mic not in the ring now used to be an old saying you make your money on the microphone not the ring all of those things come together truly prepare you for a life of going after an elected office Harvard will teach you the theory of government Harvard smart enough to bring me in and teach you the reality of government
