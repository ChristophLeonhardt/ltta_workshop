1
00:00:00,727 --> 00:00:01,761
WE WANT YOU ONE MORE.

2
00:00:01,762 --> 00:00:02,795
HERE WITH REACTION TO HOW THE

3
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:06,499
WHITE HOUSE IS FEELING,

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:06,999
KELLYANNE CONWAY.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,501
KELLY AND, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

6
00:00:08,502 --> 00:00:09,702
BEING HERE.

7
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:10,302
STAYING UP LATE FOR US.

8
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:12,872
>> OF COURSE.

9
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:15,007
>> Laura: ANY CONCERN FROM THE

10
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:17,943
WHITE HOUSE ABOUT WHERE THIS

11
00:00:17,944 --> 00:00:23,682
VOTE COUNT STANDS?

12
00:00:23,683 --> 00:00:24,717
>> WE ARE FEELING VERY CONFIDENT

13
00:00:24,718 --> 00:00:29,688
THAT EVERYTHING THE DEMOCRATS

14
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,290
AND DR. FORD HAS ASKED TO BE

15
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,092
DONE OVER THE LAST TWO AND HALF

16
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:34,927
WEEKS HAD BEEN DONE.

17
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:36,929
THE FBI SUPPLEMENTAL IS

18
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,296
COMPLETED.

19
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:40,699
THIS IS THE SEVENTH FBI VETTING

20
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,034
THAT HAS BEEN CONCEDED ON JEFF

21
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:44,904
KAVANAUGH INCLUDING TWO JUSTICE

22
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:45,271
CALENDARS.

23
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:47,039
NOW IT IS TIME FOR VOTE.

24
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,973
WE FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT.

25
00:00:47,974 --> 00:00:48,008
I'M

26
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:49,508
LOOKING TO GET AHEAD OF THOSE

27
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:50,309
WERE STILL SITTING ON THE FENCE

28
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,378
BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE

29
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,047
THERE ARE SOME RED STATE

30
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:56,982
DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE A DECISION TO

31
00:00:56,983 --> 00:01:00,319
MAKE.

32
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,988
TENT THAT NIGHT SEAT FILLED

33
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,525
THEY CAN GO AND BE COMPLACENT

34
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:10,296
WITH THE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN

35
00:01:10,297 --> 00:01:10,963
FRAUGHT WITH HYSTERICS AND

36
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:13,866
HYPERBOLE AND HYPER PARTISANSHI

37
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:14,300
PARTISANSHIP.

38
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:15,234
DEMOCRATS TRYING TO UNDO

39
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:16,669
ELECTION RESULTS FROM TWO YEARS

40
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,870
AGO, I JUST HAVE TO SLOW DOWN

41
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:19,839
THIS NOMINATION TO GET AHEAD OF

42
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,073
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS THIS YEAR.

43
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:22,541
THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY

44
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:25,044
ARE GOING TO BE A PART OF THAT.

45
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:26,846
THEY OWN ALL OF THOSE PROTESTERS

46
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:27,513
IF THEY VOTE AGAINST JUDGE

47
00:01:27,514 --> 00:01:29,315
KAVANAUGH.

48
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:30,549
THEY OWN ALL THE HYSTERICS COME

49
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,051
ALL THE CRAZINESS THAT YOU SEE

50
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:32,651
THERE.

51
00:01:32,652 --> 00:01:34,453
I THINK WE WILL HAVE THE VOTES.

52
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:35,487
HE OUGHT TO BE CONFIRMED.

53
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,290
BY THE WAY, WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN

54
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,892
HER CULTURE, MARY MAGDALENE IS

55
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:40,492
CORRECT.

56
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:43,729
IT WON'T GO AWAY WHEN HE IS

57
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,930
NOMINATED.

58
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:46,665
IT'S ABOUT DIGNITY AND

59
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,233
INTEGRITY.

60
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:49,068
>> Laura: THEY ARE OUT THERE

61
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,069
TOMORROW.

62
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,237
THEY'VE A RIGHT TO PROTEST.

63
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:52,771
THIS IS AMERICA A PARODY OF A

64
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:53,505
RIGHT TO PROTEST AS LONG AS IT

65
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:58,677
IS CIVIL.

66
00:01:58,678 --> 00:01:59,345
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL IN

67
00:01:59,346 --> 00:02:02,848
CONNECTICUT, MY HOME STATE.

68
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:04,250
HE SAID THIS TODAY ABOUT THIS

69
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:04,583
PROCESS.

70
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,452
LET'S WATCH.

71
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:09,889
>> IT STRIKES ME AS REALLY AND

72
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,125
NEGLECT OF THE FBI'S DUTY.

73
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:16,862
THE FBI IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.

74
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:19,665
I THINK THE BLAME LIES WITH THE

75
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,499
WHITE HOUSE THAT STRAITJACKETED

76
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,133
THIS INVESTIGATION.

77
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:21,767
>> Laura: YOU HEARD THAT

78
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:25,337
THROUGHOUT THE PROTEST THAT THIS

79
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:27,740
INVESTIGATION WAS CIRCUMSCRIBED,

80
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,675
ARTIFICIALLY THE DEADLINE WAS

81
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:30,075
ARTIFICIAL.

82
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:31,744
THE REAL FACT AND GET OUT.

83
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,445
THIS WAS A RUSH JOB.

84
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:34,480
FRANKLY A CON JOB.

85
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:36,882
THAT IS WHAT THE LEFT AND THE

86
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:37,583
PROTESTERS WERE SAYING.

87
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:38,784
>> WELL, HE IS LYING AND OF

88
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:40,119
COURSE HE HAS A HISTORY OF NOT

89
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,687
BEING ABLE TO TELL THE TRUTH.

90
00:02:41,688 --> 00:02:43,555
HE LIED ABOUT HIS SERVICE AND

91
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:43,923
VIETNAM.

92
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:45,424
HE DIDN'T SERVE IN VIETNAM HE

93
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:47,459
SERVED DURING VIETNAM.

94
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,761
THAT IS NOT THE DIFFERENCE OF

95
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:49,461
JUST A WORD.

96
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:53,632
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO SAT RIGHT

97
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:54,600
BEHIND HER LAST WEEK WHEN SHE

98
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:56,402
SAID I WANT TO TELL THE MEN OF

99
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:58,470
AMERICA TO SHUT UP AND HE

100
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:58,871
SMIRKED.

101
00:02:58,872 --> 00:02:59,571
I GUESS HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

102
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:01,373
WHAT SHE SAID.

103
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:03,108
THAT IS ONE THING I AGREE WITH.

104
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:05,878
HE SHOULD DEFINITELY STOP LYING

105
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,048
ABOUT THE FBI AND THIS

106
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:09,715
INVESTIGATION AND WITH THE

107
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:13,319
WHITE HOUSE DID OR DIDN'T DO.

108
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,122
THE PEOPLE THAT DR. FORD HERSELF

109
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:18,824
SAYS COULDN'T COOPERATE WERE

110
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:20,025
PART OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION.

111
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:22,661
GUESS WHAT?

112
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:23,329
THEY COULDN'T COOPERATE HER

113
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,230
ALLEGATION IT TURNS OUT.

114
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:28,500
YOU HAVE THESE SENATORS WHO HAVE

115
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:30,602
VERY SUCCESSFULLY COME FORWARD.

116
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:32,304
I THINK THIS IS A THOROUGH

117
00:03:32,305 --> 00:03:33,272
INVESTIGATION.

118
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:35,040
ONE SAID THERE IS NOT A HINT OF

119
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:35,841
ANY MISCONDUCT.

120
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:36,542
THAT THE ALLEGATIONS HAVE NOT

121
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:38,677
BEEN COOPERATED.

122
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:41,280
THE POINT IS THIS, THERE IS NO

123
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:42,081
NOMINEE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

124
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:43,716
GOING TO PUT FORWARD THAT WILL

125
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:44,216
SATISFY LIBERALS.

126
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:45,718
THERE IS NO NOMINEE THAT THEY

127
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,652
WILL EVER LIKE.

128
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:50,489
THEY HAD TO ADMIT THAT THIS IS

129
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,657
ABOUT THE MIDTERMS.

130
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:53,292
BEING OF THE MIDTERMS, I WANT TO

131
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:54,293
THANK ALL THESE CRAZY LIBERALS

132
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:57,963
BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE SOMETHING

133
00:03:57,964 --> 00:03:58,297
THAT --

134
00:03:58,298 --> 00:04:00,632
THEY HAVE ENERGIZED THIS.

135
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:03,469
>> Laura: FIVE MORE WEEKS.

136
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,405
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT I

137
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:07,873
IT.

138
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:09,942
THESE FOLKS HAVE A RIGHT TO

139
00:04:09,943 --> 00:04:10,642
PROTEST.

140
00:04:10,643 --> 00:00:00,000
THE FIRST AMENDMENT SAYS YOU CAN
