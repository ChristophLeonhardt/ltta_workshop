00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rub upside down today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,780
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the clip actually I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel kind</font>

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,279
of sick so I'm not going to do this

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,200
genuinely nearly bombed live on camera

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,760
by the way guys that was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be</font>

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,650
really great this is a video response to

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe Molly's video about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> club Molly</font>

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">started making videos again so in</font>

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,359
Molly's recent video she talked about

10
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,890
her experience of going to the club at

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,779
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> age of 17 and 18 in all the width</font>

12
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,609
ECG there my experience was very similar

13
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">but also at the same time a little bit</font>

14
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,189
different and<font color="#CCCCCC"> while she may think that</font>

15
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,689
talk of the clubbers talk of debauchery

16
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,460
hedonism and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> his other bad things</font>

17
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,189
actually very current and important

18
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,480
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I my read of the music of the</font>

19
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,489
day the parent companies the club that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

20
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,860
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to Oceana is going into</font>

21
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,660
administration Oceana was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> special</font>

22
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,520
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to probably starting</font>

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,500
age of 16 I think I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

24
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,149
youngest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my year but 16 kind of was</font>

25
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,890
the age that people started find ways of

26
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,840
going to clubs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things I didn't go</font>

27
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,640
that often I any went once in a while

28
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,469
because I was a nerd funniest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

29
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,300
about yo<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shauna is that every time you</font>

30
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,550

least I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people nowadays</font>

32
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,210
when I go out if we go up to the club

33
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,170
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm planning to go to you and</font>

34
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,399
there's a queue of more than 20 people

35
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,510
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more than like a</font>

36
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten-minute wait there are either go</font>

37
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,810
somewhere else or go home however

38
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oceania held such promise in such a</font>

39
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,689
newer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for some reason we would stay</font>

40
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,700
outside for like an hour or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two hours</font>

41
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,010
even waiting to get into this place that

42
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,869
freedom awesome that great inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

43
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,340
it was really fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go up to the bar</font>

44
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,020
and order your VK apple and then when

45
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,430
you got older more dangerous you to get

46
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,990
you or something in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Coke and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes it was</font>

47
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,430
really great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in a room with a huge</font>

48
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,810
group of girls and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be dancing</font>

49
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,490
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> just cheesy music Nokia market</font>

50
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">oceano there's a lot about it that I</font>

51
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,460
find really really creepy so for example

52
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,840
the room in which we were dance to

53
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,400
cheesy music was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the cheese room</font>

54
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,990
had one is tiled floors were all the

55
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,369
tiles of different colors of<font color="#E5E5E5"> light and</font>

56
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:36,600
they would flatten it was just amazing

57
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,189
and it was a square dance floor and had

58
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,780
like a railing around it everywhere you

59
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,070
could patch on the side with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your drinks</font>

60
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,689
but not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> where there's some shifty</font>

61
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">day figures normally probably university</font>

62
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,439
students you were like wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to creep</font>

63
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,299
on some 16 year olds<font color="#E5E5E5"> hovering on the</font>

64
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,979
dancer itself the weirdest thing was

65
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,840
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be the dance floor and then</font>

66
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,700
there's a huge high high ceiling up here

67
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,470
but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to the ceiling there</font>

68
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,479
was another floor and in the floor there

69
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,189
was like a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> sea people could stand</font>

70
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,020
around all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ratings up at the top and</font>

71
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,149
look down on the dance floor from up

72
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,799
there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> on any given night you'd be</font>

73
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,420
like dancing two steps or whatever and

74
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,098
if for a moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> you chance in the cup</font>

75
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,050
there would be these for old men looking

76
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,489
down at you and on a couple of occasions

77
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:11,910
I

78
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">god they could not have been any younger</font>

79
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,750
the 60 it was such a weird setup for

80
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,610
that was even<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to happen really one</font>

81
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the really good things from my</font>

82
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,010
perspective was also the fact that they

83
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,840
would always<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick out big groups of</font>

84
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,490
girls and take them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> front so that</font>

85
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,900
I'm the end you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> only end up with</font>

86
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">this huge queue full of guys kind of</font>

87
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,930
desperate to get in this isn't

88
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,970
exclusively no Shana thing exclusively a

89
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,050
British thing you see it happening

90
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,610
everywhere being fast-tracked wasn't

91
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,870
free you'd have to pay an extra couple

92
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">of pounds on top of the original cover</font>

93
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,890
was like four pounds or whatever so

94
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ridiculous everything about</font>

95
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,710
it was ridiculous and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would often be</font>

96
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,570
able to get vouchers or codes or

97
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,920
something online that would mean free

98
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,750
entry but you'd never get to the front

99
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the queue in time to use that free</font>

100
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,020
entry unless you got there ridiculously

101
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,180
early despite that<font color="#E5E5E5"> despite the 40 old</font>

102
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,640
man the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-hour long queues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the really</font>

103
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,800
ridiculously sugary overpriced drinks

104
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,590
despite the genuinely horrific amount of

105
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,180
unsolicited groping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font>

106
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,730
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> despite on more than one occasion</font>

107
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,380
wiping out on a very slippery floor of

108
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,660
foam party night at Oceana despite the

109
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,580
foreboding metal detectors head fight at

110
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,050
the clue the real reason why I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

111
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,430
stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> going was not any of these things</font>

112
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was mainly because the club just</font>

113
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:20,430
couldn't handle me mm-hmm did it that's

114
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,130
not a club song that's Mary why I'm

115
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,020
ridiculously excited about how long my

116
00:03:25,020 --> 00:00:00,000
hair is right now
