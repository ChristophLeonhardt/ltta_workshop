>>> WELCOME BACK.
TWO BIG INITIATIVES COMING FROM
THE FDA, MENU LABELING AND
E-CIGARETTES.
AND OUR MARK SIEGEL SAT DOWN
WITH THE FDA COMMISSIONER SCOTT
GOTTLIEB AND JOINS US NOW.
WHAT AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW
YOU HAD.
LET'S START WITH THE LABELING ON
MENUS.
THERE'S BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR
THAT.
THIS IS ABOUT HEALTH BUT IT'S
ALSO ABOUT EDUCATING PEOPLE.
>> EXACTLY.
I MEAN I COMES FROM THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THEY
DELAYED A YEAR PUTTING IT INTO
PLACE.
BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT CALORIES ON
MENUS.
AND DR. GOTTLIEB FEELS IT'S A
WAY TO FIGHT THE OBESITY
EPIDEMIC AND A NEW WAY TO HAVE A
NEW BUSINESS MODEL WHERE YOU GET
THEL
HEEL
HEALTHY CHOICES RATHER THAN
CHOICES THAT ARE BAD FOR YOU.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
>> TO HAVE INFORMATION ON MENU
LABELS THE AVERAGE CONSUMER WILL
REDUCE THEIR CALORIC INTAKE
EVERY DAY BY HAVING BETTER
INFORMATION.
IF YOU BELIEVE THE DATA WHICH
SHOWS THAT PEOPLE BECOME OBESE
BY EATING 64-CALORIES A DAY, YOU
CAN REDUCE THIS BY MAKING
INFORMATION AVAILABLE, YOU'RE A
LONG WAY TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE
TARGET OF REDUCING CALORIC
INTAKE ENOUGH.
>> YOU BELIEVE IT WILL BE LEAD
TO PRO-BUSINESS?
>> RESTAURANTS ARE GOING TO
REFORMULATE THEIR FOODS TO MAKE
THEM MORE HELD HEALTHY.
SOME CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO OPT
FOR THE HIGH CALORIE OPTION BUT
THEY'LL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
GETTING.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT SALAD
LOOKS A LOT HEALTHIER.
I'M GOING TO GO THAT DIRECTION
RATHER THAN THE PIZZA.
>> A LOT OF THE MANUFACTURERS
ARE COMPLYING WITH DELIVERY MOAN
MENUS
IT'S GOING TO HELP US CUT DOWN.
HEALTHY CHOICES MAY BE MORE
EXPENSIVE.
A BUSINESS MAY MAKE MORE MONEY
WITH THAT.
A REST RAWPT CHAIN IS GOING TO
MAKE MORE MONEY.
I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT
E-CIGARETTES.
>> A BIG THING TODAY.
I SEE SPECIFICALLY YOUNG KIDS
SMOKING E-CIGARETTES AND I
WONDER IF THIS IS A HEALTHIER
OPTION FOR THEM.
>> IT'S A GATEWAY THAT LEADS TO
SMOKING CIGARETTES AND HE'S
DISTURBED THAT NOBODY IS BEING
COMPLIANT ON THIS.
CHILDREN ARE GETTING
E-CIGARETTES WHEN THEY
SHOULDN'T.
FDA CLAMPING DOWN.
>> I'M CONCERNED ABOUT YOUTH
BECOMING ADDICTED TO NICK
BETWEEN THROUGH E-CIGARETTES.
THE TERKS CIGARETTES COULD OFFER
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ADULT
CONSUMER TO TRANSITION OFF.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A SERIES OF
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FROM FDA
AGAINST MANUFACTURERS AND
OUTLETS THAT ARE SELLING PRODUCT
TO CHILDREN TO CRACK DOWN ON
THAT.
>> TOUGH WORDS BUT IMPORTANT TO
HEAR.
>> VERY VERY IMPORTANT.
E-CIGARETTES ARE A HUGE PROBLEM.
THEY LEAD TO NICOTINE
ADDICTIONS.
>> DR. MARK SIEGEL, GREAT TO
HAVE YOU ON THIS MORNING.
AND YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR
