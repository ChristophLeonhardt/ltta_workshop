1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,610
“It’s a nasty habit.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,180
I hope to give it up one day.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,290
But, under the situation
that I’m dealing with …

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,130
For the landlord to

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,552
get me out of
this apartment,

6
00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:17,760
they would give me the money,

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,030
and I would give them the
key — that simple.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,010
So I figured the agreement
we had was imminent

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,000
and I moved all my
stuff out of here.

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,440
But, they kind of, like,
reneged on the deal.

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,670
I can’t believe
I’m still here.

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,155
They keep on selling me a
dream that’s not happening.”

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,910
Ray Tirado lives in the heart
of New York City’s largest

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,700
Puerto Rican neighborhood,
East Harlem.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,660
“Excuse the
conditions right now.”

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,800
It’s one of the last
affordable neighborhoods

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,880
in one of the most expensive
cities in the country.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,319
And it’s changing
right before his eyes.

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,050
In 2015, new owners
announced a plan

20
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,500
to tear down Ray’s 70-year-old
walk-up and replace it

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,540
with a bigger building
with a much higher rent.

22
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,100
Ray, a 58-year-old
construction worker,

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,770
has been living here
for five decades.

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,750
It’s the only home
he’s ever known.

25
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,700
And now he’s the last tenant
left in the entire building.

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,060
The last holdout.

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,040
“I did my living room
floors, wooden.

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,840
I’ve done everything here
expecting to retire here.”

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,770
His apartment is
rent-controlled,

30
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,030
which means he’s only
paying $110 a month.

31
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,200
“This is what’s actually causing
the fly infestation.”

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,130
Ray says the
building’s owners have

33
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,910
tried to force him out by
letting his home fall apart.

34
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,600
“O.K., I don’t want to go any further
than that, because

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,300
that’s going to take, like, a 
week to go down.”

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,520
But Ray’s not leaving.

37
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,520
“This used to be a 
great view.”

38
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,450
He’s one man fighting a
real estate boom sweeping

39
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,145
across Manhattan
and New York City.

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,870
The landlords didn’t
wait for him to leave.

41
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,413
They’ve already started
demolition around him.

42
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:11,890
“There’s lots of
methods that owners

43
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,410
are using to try to
get people like Ray

44
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,630
to no longer want to
stay in his apartment.

45
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,740
There’s buyouts and push-outs,
there’s harassment by construction.”

46
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,840
Harvey Epstein
represents tenants

47
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,110
who, like Ray, are fighting
to stay in their homes.

48
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,680
“What we see more
often than not

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,500
is owners who
continue to engage

50
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,004
in this type of
behavior and get away

51
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:34,420
with it because there’s really
little punishment for them.”

52
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,750
“He is living in a building
that’s 100 years old,

53
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,700
all right? And,

54
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,330
in order to correct it
we’d probably

55
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,840
have to renovate
the whole building.”

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,270
Yi Han co-owns the
property and said she’s

57
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,310
been very fair with Ray.

58
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,620
Her company offered
him $800,000

59
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,870
to move out — an unusually high
amount for the neighborhood.

60
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,340
“So the profit margin
is not that big.

61
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,700
But we’d really like
to build something

62
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,610
that will fit the demand
of the neighborhood.”

63
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,100
But even with that
much money, Ray feels

64
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,050
conflicted about leaving.

65
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,700
He can continue
fighting to hold on

66
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,660
to a crumbling apartment,
or he can take a check

67
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,880
and say goodbye to
his family home.

68
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,730
“That just didn’t affect just
the residential neighborhood.

69
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,220
It affects the entire
character of a community.

70
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,690
I mean, a buyout is how
a neighborhood changes.”

71
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,790
East Harlem is a
2.4-square-mile

72
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,940
district in Upper
Manhattan and home

73
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,856
to New York’s largest
Puerto Rican population.

74
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,820
“This is like the hall
of fame of graffiti.

75
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,980
Your neighborhood guys
that are graffiti artists

76
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,590
and they come and push
their tags over here.”

77
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,960
There’s always been a
sense of community, family

78
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,030
and familiarity. 
But Ray says

79
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,210
that’s all changing,
fast.

80
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,630
“This here in the corner

81
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,830
was at one time
a grocery store where

82
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,620
I used to buy 
my sandwiches.

83
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,480
And then it turned
into a pizzeria

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,500
place where I
could buy my pizza.

85
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,130
Now it’s a hipster
spot where it’s

86
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,690
so expensive that you couldn’t …
even happy hour is not

87
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,750
a happy hour.

88
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,209
One of the things
that we’re trying

89
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,680
to protect in this
neighborhood now

90
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,680
is some of the small-business
owners that are being pushed

91
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,790
out because of the rent.

92
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,000
Even some of the supermarkets
are being pushed out.”

93
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,850
“This is a big day 
today.

94
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,260
I want to have my normal
life back.”

95
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,060
In September 2016,

96
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,924
Ray’s one-year battle against
his landlord came to a head.

97
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:44,340
He went to court
in a last attempt

98
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,130
to hold on to his home.

99
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,630
“I’ve been living in my
apartment for over 50 years.

100
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,240
The only solvent thing that
I know is my home.

101
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,060
And I know what I have there.”

102
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,262
He just wanted his landlord
to fix the apartment.

103
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,530
But the judge was
unsympathetic to Ray’s

104
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,770
arguments and pressured
him to take a buyout:

105
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,950
$800,000 to walk away.

106
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,260
“I can’t believe this.

107
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:18,145
He told me,
‘That’s more than fair.’

108
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,430
This is not the way I 
wanted to end this fight.

109
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,520
Definitely not the way I 
wanted to end this fight.”

110
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,900
After more than a
year of resisting,

111
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,850
Ray surrendered.

112
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,710
“I’m thinking about
leaving the furniture behind.

113
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,840
Take the nightstands and 
probably take

114
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,600
the love seat or something
like that, I don’t know.

115
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,870
Take something here.

116
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,620
We’ll feel that
out and see how that goes.”

117
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,590
“All these buildings here,
I know.

118
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,270
I grew up, I used to play in
the backyards in these places.

119
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,840
In the summertime we used
to have people with bongos

120
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,270
playing, singing some songs.

121
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,042
It was a pretty
good childhood.

122
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:10,690
I don’t know what’s
going to happen to that.

123
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,030
If you look further
down Third Avenue,

124
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,950
there’s a bunch of
buildings there.

125
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,930
They’re all boarded up.

126
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,050
I mean, there’s housing that’s
being needed out here.

127
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,910
But the greed is
saying keep it

128
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,250
shut until the
gentrification is here.

129
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,640
And we’ll make
this all high-rise.

130
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,890
It takes the flavor away
from this neighborhood.”

131
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,250
But while Ray’s neighborhood
transforms around him,

132
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,210
he’s been stuck in limbo.

133
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,220
In the 18 months after
he packed up his life,

134
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,120
the debt-ridden landlord
never came through.

135
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,990
They’ve only paid Ray $50,000
of the $800,000 agreement,

136
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,190
and he’ll probably never
see the rest of the money.

137
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,774
Now the bank has moved to
foreclose on the building,

138
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,440
one of the worst
maintained in the city.

139
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,520
“I just wish there
was more laws

140
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,700
to protect the
tenants out here,

141
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,575
I don’t know how long
this is going to go on.

142
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:21,040
I don’t know how long

143
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,070
I can hang and hold on.

144
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,430
But my inner being

145
00:07:26,430 --> 00:00:00,000
and my stubbornness can’t
allow me to move out of here.
