1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:05,440
LAWMAKERS IN TENNESSEE HAVE
ABANDONED THEIR PLANS TO PROPOSE

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,850
AND PASS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD
OUTLAW CHILD MARRIAGES IN THEIR

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,850
STATE.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,230
YOU HEARD THAT CORRECTLY,
CHILD MARRIAGES OCCUR NOT ONLY

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,820
IN TENNESSEE, IN THE UNITED
STATES, BUT IT'S PARTICULARLY

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,930
BAD IN TENNESSEE.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,650
IN FACT A
RECENT INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:32,960
--

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,089
SO UNDERSTANDABLY LAWMAKERS
IN THE STATE REALIZED THERE WAS

10
00:00:36,089 --> 00:00:37,089
AN ISSUE HERE.

11
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:39,989
NOW, THERE ARE
LAWS AGAINST CHILD MARRIAGES BUT

12
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,940
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF LOOPHOLES
PEOPLE WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF.

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,800
FOR INSTANCE A JUDGE COULD
INTERVENE AND ALLOW UNDERAGE

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,329
PEOPLE TO GET MARRIED, PARENTS
COULD GET INVOLVED AND SAY THAT

15
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:56,629
THEY ALLOW THEIR 10-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER TO MARRY A MAN WHO IS

16
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:00,039
IN HIS 30S, AND SO THEY WANTED
TO CLOSE THESE LOOPHOLES.

17
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,039
BUT

18
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,110
THEN, ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE
ORGANIZATION GETS INVOLVED AND

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,560
THEY STOP IT BECAUSE THEY WERE
WORRIED THAT THIS LEGISLATION,

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,170
IF IT PASSED INTO LAW, WOULD DO
AWAY WITH THEIR EFFORTS, OR AT

21
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,560
LEAST PUT THEIR EFFORTS, TO
OUTLAW GAY MARRIAGE IN JEOPARDY.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,329
SO IN THEIR VIEW, GAY MARRIAGE
IS MUCH WORSE THAN 10-YEAR-OLDS

23
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:22,329
MARRYING PEOPLE IN THEIR 30S.

24
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:47,380
LET ME GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS --

25
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,939
AND THIS IS WHERE THINGS
START TO GET PRETTY SHADY --

26
00:01:49,939 --> 00:02:07,659
NOW, DAVID FOWLER IS THE
INDIVIDUAL WHO WANTS TO OUTLAW

27
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:10,639
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN THE STATE
OF TENNESSEE, AND HE IS THE ONE

28
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,401
WHO EMAILED THE HOUSE MAJORITY
LEADER AND CONVINCED HIM HOW

29
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:20,630
ABOUT WE PUSH THIS BILL INTO
THIS SUMMER STUDY SESSION, WHICH

30
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,670
ESSENTIALLY KILLS THE BILL.

31
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:27,090
IT'S LIKE A GAP YEAR, IT
TAKES A YEAR TO GO FIND ITSELF.

32
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,950
BECAUSE OF WOLF PAC I KNOW
ALL ABOUT HOW THEY KILL BILLS,

33
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,830
AND THE NUMBER ONE WAY IS, WE
WILL CONSIDER IT LATER.

34
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,830
WHICH

35
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,280
MEANS WE ARE DONE WITH IT, WE
AREN'T CONSIDERING IT.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
SO SUMMER

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,860
STUDY MEANS WE KILLED THE BILL,
IT'S DONE.

38
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:46,130
SO WHAT IS FOWLER'S REASONING,
HIS LEGAL THEORY BEHIND KILLING

39
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,130
THIS BILL?

40
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,440
AND WHY WOULD THAT
BILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT HIS

41
00:02:49,440 --> 00:03:33,190
EFFORTS 
TO OUTLAW SAME SEX

42
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,290
MARRIAGE?

43
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,390
WELL --

44
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,960
LOOK, I'M NOT A LAWYER AND I'M
NOT PRIVY TO THE LAWS AND SO I

45
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,140
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE COMMENTING ON
THAT, WHETHER OR NOT THAT LEGAL

46
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,900
THEORY IS ACCURATE, BUT WHAT I
WILL SAY, AND THIS IS SOMETHING

47
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,350
THAT IS KNOWN, IS THAT THEY
GENUINELY THINK SAME-SEX

48
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,580
MARRIAGE IS WORSE THAN KIDS
GETTING PRESSURED AND FORCED

49
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,380
INTO MARRIAGE, WHICH IS WHAT IS
HAPPENING HERE.

50
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,380
10-YEAR-OLD

51
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,970
GIRLS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO
CONSENT TO MARRYING SOME

52
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,200
31-YEAR-OLD DUDE.

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,090
LISTEN, SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE
IN THEIR HEART OF HEARTS AND

54
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,060
THROUGH SOME OF THEIR RELIGIOUS
CONVICTIONS THAT MARRIAGE IS

55
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,650
SIMPLY THE UNION OF ONE MAN AND
ONE CHILD.

56
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,270
BY THE WAY, THAT IS LITERAL,
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF EXAMPLES

57
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,380
IN THE BIBLE.

58
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,839
THEY AREN'T THAT
FAR OFF.

59
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,939
WHICH GETS ME TO MY

60
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,320
POINT THAT SOME MIGHT CONSIDER
CONTROVERSIAL.

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
YEAH THEY CARE

62
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,470
MORE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF GAY
RIGHTS AND TAKING AWAY

63
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,880
GAY RIGHTS, AND THAT'S A GOOD
WAY OF FRAMING IT, ANA, BUT I

64
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,910
ACTUALLY THINK THEY DON'T MIND
CHILD MARRIAGE.

65
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,910
THEY THINK IT'S

66
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,420
PART OF THEIR CULTURE.

67
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,730
THAT IS A
CONSERVATIVE THING.

68
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,730
I DON'T WANT

69
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,290
ANYONE GETTING ME WRONG, I'M NOT
SAYING EVERY CONSERVATIVE IN THE

70
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,260
COUNTRY, A CONSERVATIVE FROM
CALIFORNIA THINKS IT'S AWESOME

71
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,050
FOR 10-YEAR-OLDS TO MARRY
30-YEAR-OLDS.

72
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,050
NO.

73
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,050
WHAT I'M

74
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,770
SAYING THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN
TENNESSEE, KENTUCKY, SOME STATES

75
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,950
WHERE THIS IS BEING DISCUSSED,
WHO GOT MARRIED WHEN THEY WERE

76
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,740
13, WHO HAVE A TRADITION AND A
CULTURE OF GETTING MARRIED VERY

77
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,670
YOUNG AND THAT WAS INTERTWINED
WITH THEIR RELIGIOUS VIEWS OF

78
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,810
THE WORLD, SO I THINK THEY JUST
FLAT OUT DON'T WANT TO GET RID

79
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,150
OF THE LAW.

80
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,800
WHAT IS ONE OF THE COMMON
SMEARS THAT WE HEARD FROM THE

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,190
RIGHT WING WHEN IT CAME TO THE
PROHIBITION OF SAME-SEX

82
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,190
MARRIAGE?

83
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,990
WHAT WAS A COMMON
SMEAR THAT GAY PEOPLE HAD TO

84
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,000
DEAL WITH?

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,260
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GO
AFTER THE KIDS.

86
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,590
THAT THEY WOULD BE PEDOPHILES,
THAT THEY WERE DISGUSTING -- NO,

87
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,990
YOU ARE THE PEDOPHILES, YOU ARE
SUPPORTING THE MARRIAGE OF A

88
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,040
10-YEAR-OLD TO A 31-YEAR-OLD,
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

89
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
ANOTHER

90
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,639
CLASSIC CASE OF PROJECTION.

91
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,180
AND LOOK, IT'S NOT AN
ACCIDENT, AND NOT JUST

92
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,460
POLITICAL, THAT THERE WERE A LOT
OF PEOPLE IN ALABAMA THAT

93
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,460
DEFENDED ROY MOORE.

94
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,389
AND IF YOU
REMEMBER SOME OF THE DEFENSES

95
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,450
WE QUOTED FROM REPUBLICAN
OFFICIALS IN ALABAMA, IT WAS A

96
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,110
LOT OF, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

97
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,490
WHAT, YOU DIDN'T DO THAT?

98
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,020
AGAIN,

99
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,760
NOT ALL CONSERVATIVES, AND I
DON'T SAY THAT BECAUSE I'M

100
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,760
POLITICALLY CORRECT, I WILL CALL
ALL CONSERVATIVES ALL SORTS OF

101
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,530
NAMES, BUT THERE IS SOME SUBSET
OF CONSERVATIVES, ESPECIALLY IN

102
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,590
THAT REGION OF THE COUNTRY, WHO
THINK WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

103
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,590
AND

104
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,510
IF I WANT THAT, THAT SHOULD BE
PART OF MY PRIVILEGE.

105
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,510
AND ANA,

106
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,350
YOU ARE RIGHT, I HADN'T THOUGHT
OF IT THAT WAY, THEY SAY GAY

107
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,410
PEOPLE THAN ARE INTERESTED IN
YOUNG KIDS.

108
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:29,170
STATUTORY RATE MEANS SOMEONE
UNDER 16 CAN'T GIVE CONSENT, SO

109
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,790
IF YOU ARE MARRIED TO SOMEONE
WHO IS 10 YEARS OLD, THAT IS

110
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,730
JUST BY DEFINITION OF LAW RAPE,
RIGHT?

111
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,050
IT'S NOT THAT THEY CAN'T GIVE
CONSENT, THE PARENTS GIVE

112
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,050
CONSENT.

113
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,990
BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE CONSENT
FOR YOUR KID TO HAVE SEX.

114
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,150
YOU CAN GIVE CONSENT FOR YOUR
KID TO ENTER INTO MARRIAGE,

115
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,270
AND THAT'S THE LAW AND A LOT OF
THESE PLACES.

116
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,060
I THOUGHT THAT WAS AFTER YOU
WORK OLD ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO

117
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,440
SEX BUT TOO YOUNG FOR MARRIAGE.

118
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:59,180
THAT'S THE INSANE PART, JIMMY
IS IN A SENSE RIGHT, IN

119
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,210
KENTUCKY, THEY WERE ALSO
CONSIDERING A BILL TO END THE

120
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,010
LOOPHOLES TO END CHILD MARRIAGE
IN KENTUCKY AND IT ALSO GOT HELD

121
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,490
UP BY RIGHT-WING INTERESTS, THEY
CLAIM FOR OTHER REASONS, WE CAN

122
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,940
GET INTO THAT IN A SECOND, I
DON'T BELIEVE THEM -- ANYWAY, A

123
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,960
WOMAN IN KENTUCKY WHO WANTS TO
COMBAT THIS SAYS, QUOTE, THIS IS

124
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,919
LEGALIZED RAPE OF CHILDREN.

125
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,150
BECAUSE IN THOSE CASES, IF YOU

126
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,580
ARE A 31-YEAR-OLD GUY AND YOU
SLEPT WITH A 10-YEAR-OLD IN THE

127
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,270
STATE OF TENNESSEE YOU WOULD GO
TO PRISON FOR PROBABLY DECADES,

128
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,120
AS YOU SHOULD.

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,760
BUT IF YOU ARE A
31-YEAR-OLD WHO GOT THE

130
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,750
PERMISSION OF HER PARENTS TO
MARRY HER AND THEN HAD SEX WITH

131
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,000
HER THAT WOULD BE PERFECTLY
LEGAL.

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
IT'S INSANE.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,540
BY THE WAY, THAT IS THE LAW
TODAY IN TENNESSEE.

134
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,760
AND AGAIN THEY KILLED THE BILL
THAT WOULD DO AWAY WITH THE

135
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,580
LOOPHOLES TO PROTECT THESE KIDS.

136
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,070
SOME OF THEM ARE THREE-DAY
WAITING PERIODS BEFORE HAVING A

137
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,070
WEDDING.

138
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,389
YOU HAVE PLANNED A
WEDDING, I'VE PLANNED A WEDDING.

139
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,060
THREE DAYS, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

140
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,060
WE NEED TO GET THESE CHILDREN

141
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,040
MARRIED NOW BEFORE IT GETS --
INSERT SOMETHING DISGUSTING

142
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,050
THERE.

143
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:11,800
IT'S LIKE WE NEED TO GET
THIS KID MARRIED NOW, WE CAN'T

144
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,100
WAIT 72 HOURS.

145
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,139
IF YOU LOOK AT THE U.S. AS A
WHOLE, THERE ARE OTHER STATES

146
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,740
WHO HAVE LOOPHOLES LIKE THIS ON
THE BOOKS --

147
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:29,990
87% ARE GIRLS, ONE 
THIRD WERE

148
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,688
16 AND UNDER, 14% MARRIED OTHER

149
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:40,989
MINORS, SURE, THE YOUNGEST
CHILDREN TO MARRY WERE THREE

150
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,279
10-YEAR-OLD GIRLS IN TENNESSEE.

151
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,660
THIS IS ALL FROM A FRONTLINE

152
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,149
REPORT.

153
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:51,910
THE YOUNGEST GROOM WAS
AN 11-YEAR-OLD WHO MARRIED A

154
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,910
27-YEAR-OLD.

155
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,019
ONE OF THE OLDEST
PERSON TO MARRY A CHILDREN WAS A

156
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:59,699
74-YEAR-OLD IN ALABAMA, HIS
BRIDE WAS 14.

157
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:02,420
WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT
ALABAMA CONSERVATIVES WHO WANT

158
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,820
TO MARRY 14-YEAR-OLDS?

159
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,829
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT STORY, AND
THERE IT IS.

160
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:09,000
THE STATE RAISED THE AGE TO 16
AFTERWARDS.

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,300
THAT'S SOMETHING.

162
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,939
MY POINT ABOUT CULTURE, AND
KENTUCKY THE RIGHT-WING GROUP

163
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:17,199
WANTS TO DEFEAT THIS LEGISLATION
SAYS WE ARE JUST LOOKING OUT FOR

164
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:18,439
PARENTAL RIGHTS.

165
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:22,649
IN CASE THE
PARENT WANTS TO CONSENT.

166
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,129
AND

167
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:33,529
THEY HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF
EXCUSES, I DON'T BELIEVE THEM.

168
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,209
THESE STATES COULD END WHAT IS
IN ESSENCE, AS JIMMY POINTED OUT

169
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:42,019
AND AS THE EXPERTS POINT OUT,
LEGALIZED CHILD RATE, BUT THEY

170
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:44,579
AREN'T DOING IT.

171
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:50,689
ONE OF THE
WOMEN WAS MARRIED OFF AT 16 TO A

172
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:55,869
PREDATOR WHO MOLESTED HER AT 14
AND CONTINUED TO, HER PARENTS

173
00:09:55,869 --> 00:09:57,819
PRESSURED HER TO MARRY HIM.

174
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:03,920
I'VE
USED THIS EXAMPLE OFTEN, IN

175
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,569
CENTRAL ASIA THERE ARE NOMADIC
CULTURES THAT USED TO KIDNAP

176
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:12,439
WOMEN BECAUSE THEY WERE NOMADS
AND THEY WOULD DO RAIDS, THEY

177
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:13,600
STILL HAVE THAT TRADITION.

178
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,110
SOME,
NOT ALL, SOME OF THEM STILL

179
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,259
KIDNAP WOMEN, RAPE THEM, AND
THEN THE WOMAN'S PARENTS COME

180
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:23,980
OVER AND SAY DON'T CAUSE US
EMBARRASSMENT, JUST MARRY YOUR

181
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,269
RAPIST.

182
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:28,059
AND WE GO ALL MY GOD,
LOOK AT THESE CENTRAL ASIAN

183
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:30,660
COUNTRIES, LOOK AT THESE MUSLIM
FUNDAMENTALISTS, LOOK AT THESE

184
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,540
GUYS -- MEANWHILE RIGHT HERE IN
TENNESSEE AND KENTUCKY, THAT

185
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,571
CASE IN KENTUCKY, THE WOMAN WHO
HAD BEEN ABUSED SINCE 14, HER

186
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:41,899
MOM CAME AND CONVINCED HER TO
MARRY HER MOLESTER, AND ONE OF

187
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,940
HER REASONS WAS, WHAT IS THE BIG
DEAL?

188
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,970
I GOT MARRIED AT 13.

189
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,249
BECAUSE THERE IS A CERTAIN
SUBSET OF CULTURE THAT IS USED

190
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:55,970
TO THAT KIND OF MARRIAGE, PARTLY
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HIT PUBERTY,

191
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,259
THE BIBLE INSTRUCTS US IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO HAVE KIDS, AND YOU

192
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,279
CAN'T HAVE SEX OUTSIDE OF
MARRIAGE SO UP AND AT 'EM.

193
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,269
SO THIS IS WHAT THEY MEAN
WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE

194
00:11:06,269 --> 00:00:00,000
SANCTITY MARRIAGE.
