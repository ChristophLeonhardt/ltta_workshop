WITH THE PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY

8
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:19,806
NUGGET YOU HAVE TO SEARCH FOR

9
00:00:19,806 --> 00:00:22,175
THAT SAYS:

10
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:25,245
NOTHING PUBLICLY DISCLOSED TIES

11

THEY DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE OF

19
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:41,828
THAT.

20
00:00:41,828 --> 00:00:47,534
IT'S A SHAME THAT THEY HAVE --

21
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:48,935
THEY WON'T ANSWER CONGRESS ON

22
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:51,104
HOW MUCH MONEY THIS IS COSTING

23
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:52,072

24
00:00:52,072 --> 00:00:53,773

26
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:59,579

WOULD INDICATE THE ELEMENTS OF

THE CRIME.

39
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:24,304
>> WE CAN PRODUCE A MEMO THAT

40
00:01:24,304 --> 00:01:29,309
REBUTS THEM ALL 1,000%.

41
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:30,277

THE SENATE COMMITTEE RELEASED

49
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:41,688
THE NOTES.

50
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:44,925
HE SAID HE DID NOT HAVE A MEMORY

51
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:46,960
ABOUT TALKING TO HIS FATHER

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,527
SPECIFICALLY.

53
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:48,695
THEY ARE FOCUSSING ON THIS

54
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:50,630
BLOCKED CALL HE MADE THAT DAY.

55
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,564
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER WHETHER IT

56
00:01:51,564 --> 00:01:53,199
WAS TO HIS FATHER OR NOT.

57
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:55,568
THAT'S THE THEORY THEY ARE

58
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:58,371
SPINNING OUT.

59
00:01:58,505 --> 00:02:01,441
IN THE OFFICE, IT WOULD BE EASY

60
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,576
FOR HIM --

61
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:04,344
>> Laura: JUNE 26th.

62
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:07,047
>> AND THAT'S WHEN I JOINED THE

63
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:08,281
CAMPAIGN.

64
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:11,017
NOBODY WILL FOCUS ON A RUSSIAN

65
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:12,986
WOMAN WHO SAID SHE HAD

66
00:02:12,986 --> 00:02:14,521
INFORMATION ABOUT HILLARY.

67
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:15,655
SHE WANTS TO NEGOTIATE SANCTIONS

68
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:17,390
AND THEY THROW HER OUT.

69
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,725
WHEN SHE WANTS TO MEET AGAIN,

70
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:19,659
THEY DON'T MEET WITH HER.

71
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:20,927
I WOULD NOT REMEMBER THAT.

72
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:23,763
I HAVE PEOPLE COMING UP TO ME

73
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:25,999
SAYING ALL KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT

74
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:26,333
HILLARY.

75
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,901
I BELIEVE ALMOST ANYTHING ABOUT

76
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:28,234
HILLARY.

77
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:31,538
I SAY GET RID OF THEM.

78
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:38,878
>> Laura: THE CNN HEADLINES SAID

79
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,014
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR DIRT ON

80
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:41,481
HILLARY CLINTON?

81
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:42,682
>> AND THEY WERE NOT LOOKING FOR

82
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:44,250
DIRT ON DONALD TRUMP.

83
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,119
WHEN I RAN, THEY WERE LOOKING

84
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:47,153
FOR DIRT ON ME EVERY DAY.

85
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:48,088
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

86
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:48,788
MAYBE YOU SHOULD NOT.

87
00:02:48,788 --> 00:02:50,090
BUT YOU DO IT.

88
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,491
THERE IS NOTHING ILLEGAL ABOUT

89
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:51,791
THAT.

90
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,227
EVEN IF IT COMES FROM A RUSSIAN

91
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:56,229
OR A GERMAN OR AN AMERICAN, IT

92
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:57,130
DOESN'T MATTER.

93
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,331
THEY NEVER USED IT.

94
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:00,033
THAT'S THE MAIN THING.

95
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:01,701
THEY REJECTED IT.

96
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:03,103
IF THERE WAS COLLUSION WITH THE

97
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:05,171
RUSSIANS THEY WOULD HAVE USED

98
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:05,438
IT.

99
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:06,206
>> Laura: DO YOU THINK IN THE

100
00:03:06,206 --> 00:03:08,308
END WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE

101
00:03:08,308 --> 00:03:11,911
MAIN FLASH POINTS, THE TRUMP

102
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:13,380
TOWER MEETING AND THE STORMY

103
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,814
DANIELS PAYMENT AND THE RAID ON

104
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:16,683
MANAFORT AND THE RAID ON COHEN,

105
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:19,886
IS THERE ANY ONE PART THAT

106
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:20,887
CONCERNS YOU MORE THAN OTHER

107
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:21,921
PARTS OF THAT?

108
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:24,057
>> YES, THE INABILITY TO REACH A

109
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:25,625
CONCLUSION THAT IS OBVIOUS.

110
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,794
THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO RECOGNIZE

111
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:29,429
THE DAMAGE THIS DOES TO OUR

112
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:30,263
COUNTRY ALL OVER THE WORLD.

113
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:32,499
THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS

114
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:32,932
INVESTIGATION.

115
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:36,169
THERE WAS NEVER A GOOD REASON

116
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:36,603
FOR IT.

117
00:03:36,603 --> 00:03:40,173
THIS WAS ENGINEERED BY COMEY

118
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:42,475
WITH THE INTERVIEW THING HE

119
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:45,812
WROTE THAT HE SHOULD NEVER

120
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:46,179
REVEALED.

121
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:49,682
HE LEAKED IT ILLEGALLY THROUGH A

122
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:50,050
PROFESSOR.

123
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,519
>> Laura: THE DOJ IS RELEASING

124
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:53,987
THOSE DOCUMENTS ON THAT

125
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:56,189
PARTICULAR PROFESSOR.

126
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:57,791
>> COMEY SHOULD BE UNDER

127
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,758
INVESTIGATION.

128
00:03:58,758 --> 00:04:00,693
CLINTON WANTED HIM FIRED BEFORE

129
00:04:00,693 --> 00:04:04,764
WE DID FOR WHAT HE DID TO HER.

130
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:09,669
THAT WAS UNETHICAL INCRIMINATING

131
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:09,936
HER.

132
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:11,571
THEN THIS SPECIOUS ARGUMENT SHE

133
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:14,574
SHOULD NOT BE PROSECUTED.

134
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:15,842
>> Laura: DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE

135
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:17,877
HOW THESE THINGS TEND TO GO?

136
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:20,279
THERE IS ANY CHANCE THAT BOB

137
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,683
MUELLER GAVE IMMUNITY TO JIM

138
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:23,983
COMEY?

139
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:24,784
>> NO, I DON'T.

140
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:28,021
I HAVE NO IDEA IF HE GAVE HIM

141
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:28,388
IMMUNITY.

142
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:30,056
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE IS NOT BEING

143
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:30,490
INVESTIGATED.

144
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,391
THAT TROUBLES US.

145
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,393
A LOT OF THE PRESIDENT'S

146
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:34,494
STATEMENTS CONTRADICT COMEY.

147
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:37,697
THEY ARE MORE LOGICAL THAN

148
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:38,031
COMEY'S.

149
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:38,998
IF YOU WANT TO JUST BELIEVE

150
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:41,367
COMEY, THEN YOU ARE WALKING INTO

151
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:42,268
A TRAP.

152
00:04:42,268 --> 00:04:45,405
COMEY HASN'T BEEN INVESTIGATED.

153
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:48,174
I DON'T THINK WE WOULD SIT DOWN

154
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:49,609
FOR AN INTERVIEW UNLESS COMEY

155
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:51,945
WAS INVESTIGATED IN THE SAME

156
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:52,212
WAY.

157
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:53,613
>> Laura: GOLDBERG, A FORMER

158
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:56,049
TRUMP LAWYER.

159
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:57,484
I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF HIM?

160
00:04:57,484 --> 00:05:01,020
>> YES, I TRIED CASES AGAINST

161
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,621
HIM.

162
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:05,792
I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T THINK THAT

163
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,026
GIULIANI WAS THE RIGHT PERSON

164
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:09,462
FOR HIM TO SELECT.

165
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:11,364
I THOUGHT THERE WERE MUCH BETTER

166
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:15,235
PEOPLE HE BEING USE IN TERMS OF

167
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:17,303
NEGOTIATING CAN MUELLER.

168
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:21,374
>> I GUESS I BET HIM TOO MANY

169
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:21,941
TIMES.

170
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:22,375
[LAUGHING].

171
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,078
HE IS GETTING A LITTLE OLD.

172
00:05:25,078 --> 00:05:28,615
THE ONLY THING I HAVE IS THE

173
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:30,116
PRESIDENT TRUSTS ME AND I TRUST

174
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:30,783
THE PRESIDENT.

175
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:32,585
I HAVE HIS BACK IN THE RIGHT

176
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:32,852
WAY.

177
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:34,854
I WOULD REPRESENT ANY PRESIDENT

178
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:36,055
PUT UNDER THIS TORTURE.

179
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:37,891
THIS IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE

180
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:38,258
COUNTRY.

181
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:41,461
I AM DOING THIS PRO-BONO BECAUSE

182
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:44,731
I BELIEVE THIS IS JUST PLAIN

183
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:45,031
WRONG.

184
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:46,032
>> Laura: THE TOLL THIS TAKES ON

185
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:47,133
THE FAMILY.

186
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:51,404
YOU MENTIONED IVANKA.

187
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:54,507
YOU SAID JARED WAS DISPOSABLE.

188
00:05:54,507 --> 00:05:55,642
>> I WAS KIDDING AROUND.

189
00:05:55,642 --> 00:05:58,244
JARED LOVED IT.

190
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:00,713
HE SAID DID MY WIFE TELL ME TO

191
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:01,147
SAY THAT?

192
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:07,153
I SAID NO, I AM DISPOSABLE TOO.

193
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:09,255
>> Laura: YOU ARE NOT WORRIED

194
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:11,658
ABOUT THE EXPOSURE BECAUSE OF

195
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:13,226
THE MEETING WITH THE RUSSIAN

196
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:13,560
BANKER.

197
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,762
>> NONE WAS ABOUT GETTING HER

198
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:16,462
EMAILS.

199
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:17,363
IT WAS DIRTY INFORMATION THEY

200
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:18,198
ALLEGED TO HAVE.

201
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:19,899
THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT.

202
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:21,334
END OF STORY.

203
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:24,404
>> Laura: THE MEETING JARED HAD

204
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:25,638
WITH THE RUSSIAN BANK?

205
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:27,840
>> THAT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT

206
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,308
BUSINESS THING.

207
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:29,976
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

208
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:31,978
COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIANS.

209
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:32,712
THE ELECTION WAS OVER.

210
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:35,782
>> Laura: IF YOU ORDERED A WHITE

211
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:37,750
RUSSIAN HERE, YOU WOULD NUMBER

212
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,084
TROUBLE.

213
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:40,553
>> I HAVE NOT BEEN IN RUSSIA IN

214
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:42,956
4 OR 5 YEARS.

215
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:44,057
THANK GOD.

216
00:06:44,057 --> 00:06:45,792
>> Laura: DO YOU HAVE ANY

217
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,493
CONCERN THAT THERE IS NO REAL

218
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:51,164
WAY AT THIS POINT TO GET A FAIR

219
00:06:51,164 --> 00:06:55,335
OUTCOME BY A SPECIAL COUNSEL

220
00:06:55,335 --> 00:07:08,414
THAT MAY BEGUN AND NAMED ON

221
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:09,148
SPEARIOUS GROUNDS?

222
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:15,355
>> I THINK WE WILL BE INDICATED

223
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:18,358
IN COURT.

224
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:20,493
>> Laura: YOU ARE NOT GOING TO

225
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:23,096
THE COURT WITH THE PRESIDENT.

226
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:23,997
>> NO.

227
00:07:23,997 --> 00:07:27,734
CHALLENGING THE LOGISTICS OF

228
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:30,069
THEIR INVESTIGATION AND THEIR

229
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,104
AUTHORITY AND THE WAY THEY

230
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:32,238
SPANED IT OUT SO MUCH.

231
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:35,942
>> Laura: YOU MAINTAIN THAT THE

232
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:38,511
EXPANSION OF THE PROBE IS

233
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:38,945
ILLEGITIMATE.

234
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:40,079
>> WHAT THEY DID WITH MANAFORT

235
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,614
AND WITH MICHAEL COHEN.

236
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:45,051
ALL OF THE ILLEGITIMATE THINGS

237
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:46,619
THEY HAVE DONE.

238
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:48,121
POSSIBLY PLACING A SPY IN THE

239
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:49,422
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

240
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:51,758
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE AREAS

241
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:54,160
WHERE INDICTMENTS WERE

242
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,527
DISMISSED.

243
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:57,764
SOME OF THESE SAME PEOPLE HAVE

244
00:07:57,764 --> 00:07:58,298
DONE IT.

245
00:07:58,298 --> 00:07:59,899
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT BOB WAS

246
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,902
THINKING ABOUT HIRING SOME OF

247
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:05,605
THESE PEOPLE.

248
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:12,345
>> Laura: HOPE HICKS' NAME WAS

249
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:13,680
THROWN AROUND IN THE TRUMP TOWER

250
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,580
MEETING.

251
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,017
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HIS

252
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:18,851
CONVERSATIONS AT ALL?

253
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:22,455
>> THOSE STATEMENTS WERE NOT

254
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:24,590
UNDER OATH.

255
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,625
THAT WOULD BE REALLY CHEAP.

256
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,895
>> Laura: HE IS TURNING THE

257
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:30,830
SCREWS ON PEOPLE AS JUDGE ELLIS

258
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,297
SAID.

259
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:33,265
NOT BECAUSE HE THINKS ABOUT

260
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:33,633
MANAFORT.

261
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:36,602
HE CARES ABOUT GETTING TO TRUMP.

262
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:39,172
>> HOW COULD MANAFORT IN 2004

263
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:42,909
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?

264
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,809
>> Laura: MANAFORT IS DIFFERENT

265
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,212
FROM A 30-YEAR-OLD OR A

266
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:47,980
25-YEAR-OLD WHO IS LIKE I WON'T

267
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,482
LOSE MY LIVELIHOOD.

268
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:51,050
YOU KNOW HOW THEY OPERATE.

269
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,821
YOU WERE A PROSECUTOR.

270
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:56,522
>> I WORKED WITH HOPE.

271
00:08:56,522 --> 00:08:57,623
>> Laura: SHE IS FANTASTIC.

272
00:08:57,623 --> 00:08:59,092
>> SHE IS NOT GOING TO LIE.

273
00:08:59,092 --> 00:09:03,730
>> Laura: NO, NO, I AM JUST

274
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,964
USING THAT AS AN EXAMPLE.

275
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:10,803
YOU KNOW HOW THEY WORK.

276
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:13,439
>> IF THEY DID THAT TO HER THE

277
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:14,207
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE TO

278
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:15,375
STEP IN AND ACT.

279
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,776
THAT'S TOTAL INJUSTICE.

280
00:09:16,776 --> 00:09:18,978
THEY HAVE DONE A FEW INJUSTICES

281
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:21,214
BUT NOT AS BAD AS THAT NOW.

282
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:22,715
>> Laura: THE TIMELINE FOR THIS

283
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:23,216
TO WRAP UP?

284
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:25,585
>> THEY SHOULD DO IT TODAY.

285
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:26,152
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

286
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:28,855
I THINK THEY HAVE THE FACTS ON

287
00:09:28,855 --> 00:09:30,223
WHICH THEY CAN WRITE THEIR

288
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:30,556
REPORT.

289
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:32,425
IT WAS A FAIR REPORT, FINE.

290
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:32,725
RIGHT.

291
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:34,694
IF YOU RIGHT AN UNFAIR REPORT,

292
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:38,131
WRITE IT AND WE WILL COMPAT IT.

293
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,966
WE ARE READY TO RIP IT APART AND

294
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:41,934
RIP THEM APART IF THAT'S WHAT

295
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:42,535
THEY WANT.

296
00:09:42,535 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WOULD RATHER PEACEFULLY
