the executive editor of Fox News is in trouble today for an editorial attacking the u.s. Winter Olympics team and the editorial has already been pulled but we're going to read a few excerpts for you he said this unless it changed overnight the motto of the Olympics in 1894 has been faster higher strong it appears the US Olympic Committee would like to change that to darker gayer different if your goal is to win medals that won't work a u.s. OC official was quoted this week expressing pride what else about taking the most diverse US squad ever to the Winter Olympics that was followed by a frankly embarrassing laundry list of how many african-american Asians and openly gay athletes are on this year's US team no sport that we are aware of Awards points or medals for skin color or sexual orientation insisting that sports bout a political correctness by assigning teams quotas for race religion or sexuality is like saying that professional basketball goals will be worth four points if achieved by a minority in that sport white guys for instance instead of the two or three points awarded to black players who make up eighty-one percent to the NBA any plans to fix that disparity didn't think so interesting that that's the disparity he thought of and so he's mad that we shouldn't be bowing to these quotas is he as he's saying that there are quotas no does he have evidence that he's presenting that the quotas no but they're proud that we have a diverse representative group of Olympics Olympians Olympians and that is enough for him at this point to imply that the entire thing is suspect because how dare we have out of the closet gay is serving on the Olympics okay so this guy is a very important person at at Fox News he helped Roger Ailes set up Fox News he's been there for a long time he's the executive editor and executive vice president of Fox News now after the controversy somebody from Fox is like well I am NOT him on the day day very keen decisions by the way that's not remotely true another person inside the building said yes he is okay and I've seen the internal memos that were leaked from Fox News John Moody's all over them he's intimately involved and since Ailes has left and now of course sales has passed away but he's one of the most important guys in the building and so part of the reason that they put up that' toriel without checking with others is because he was so senior than they're like who's gonna question John moody so they just printed it so now when I saw it in the headline I was like ok but let me read the whole thing now it sounds terrible and I'm sure that it's going to be he's gonna have these you know a bias ridiculous way of interpreting the facts but let me read his facts first then he didn't have any facts I was like no you're kidding you wrote this article about how you don't you think that it is by definition by Stu have darker athletes let alone gayer because you think so I thought that he would have like I know that he wasn't gonna have well we had a downhill skier who is white who had a quicker time and the black skier but they eliminated him anyway like that's inconceivable with we go based purely on the time right ok but I thought I know that he can't do that and I knew that but I thought he might go with an argument well like figure skaters it's judging and let me show you white athletes who scored higher in earlier rounds but when they got to the you know the pub where they were gonna make the decisions they they had the gay ur gay ur gay figure skaters which they have to discriminate in favor of to find them anyway so somehow their scores became more inflated no no he didn't even bother he's he has no evidence no facts no nothing so so that leads to several Devery things one is look at the assumption he makes the assumption is if things were fair well obviously the whites would get it if things were fair obviously the straight people would get it it is assumed that people in my category are the ones who should have the spots and if you gave it to the gay athlete you gave it to the black athlete you must have cheated to give it to him yeah I mean more most of the sports are simply who went faster so it is that assumption is amazing and by the way it's and so it's not about geometry so it isn't he's a very pivotal character in Fox News and yes if fox news apparently sets the agenda for the President and for the country god help us but it's also more important because it gives you an insight into the right-wing way of thinking and this goes all the way back you know throughout American history but it as it regards to athletes so if you don't know this amazing story back in 1966 NCAA championship had Kentucky which is a powerhouse at the time up against Texas Western and Kentucky as usual had five white basketball players who represented them Texas Western though had for the first time ever five starting black basketball players and all the writers of the time gonna beat the white basketball players have no chance right and then in the articles you go back and it's amazing the quotes are like compare them to monkeys they say well you know they might be athletic and they might score a lot in fact Texas Western was known for its defense and its discipline and that's exactly what they did to beat Kentucky spoiler alert okay but but they said oh if you let the black athletes go out on the court without any white teammates it'll be chaos right because they don't know what they're doing they're not smart and they can't handle it so the assumptions were always the white kids deserve the spots right we but if you want to bring in black kids I guess what you think blacks are good at basketball okay give it a shot big guy right and it and so that kind of racism has been with us for a long long time yes thank God the NBA and other major sports have largely gotten past it you could argue not completely but certainly a long way towards towards fixing that in NFL's got some issues and well with Jernigan cetera but he said but like in John Moody's world he thinks that white people are discriminated against otherwise they'd have all the Olympic spots so it's does it look like we're discriminating against white quarterbacks for example like Tom Brady Peyton Manning and Rogers you remember when they benched Tom Brady for a black gay quarterback I would make one more point as it pertains to the Olympics to become an Olympic athlete you have to sacrifice so much of your life you have to you have to achieve at such a high level no one's giving you a break for race or orientation of any kind in fact you may have to swim upstream against a lot of prejudices of the sort that Jenks been mentioning and you can think about back in Major League Baseball to Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron these guys just to participate in the sport of baseball Jackie Robinson had to make it through this gauntlet of racism and Juke to break the homerun record Hank Aaron who was a obviously a black ballplayer who broke the homerun record he had death threats against him another so you're having to achieve is my point through this headwind of racism and all the other sorts of prejudice that kick in when you're when you're gay at cetera and then you're become an Olympic athlete as Jenks says most of it's done on time and and and basic performance that is quite measurable I think these Olympians are extraordinary and too so when you read an article like this that doesn't recognize any of that that doesn't recognize those insane sacrifices that I have to make it just it whips your head around it's like again it's like something out of 1950 it's just crazy or 1936 yeah just because so Jesse OC anyone I know this and and I learned it recently it's a really interesting fact so Jesse Owens goes to the 1936 Olympics in Germany a Hitler won't in fact not only did Hitler not shake his hand he wouldn't shake anyway a flee tense because the Olympic Committee told him you either shake all the gold medal winners hands or none of them and so he stayed home because Jesse Owens won four gold medals but what you might not know is when he came back here even FDR wouldn't let him in the White House and he said that he was he didn't want to be seen as soft on the Negro issue so he didn't let any of the eight in black Olympians go to the white house and then they asked Jesse Owens to go on a publicity tour for the Olympic Committee and he said sorry I'm not gonna do that given how you guys have treated me you know what Jesse Owens did the rest of his life he became a janitor and then a gas attendant that's how we treated Jesse Owens forget how the Nazis treated him that's how we treated him okay and so now to Jackie Robinson he actually does mention it right John moody doesn't in this article so give him credit for you know say hello to Jackie Robinson was good he broke the color barrier that's a good thing okay so he's does that obligatory thing but then he says now remember you should be like Jackie Robinson and he quotes Robinson as saying don't complain work harder but that makes it sound like Jackie Robinson was the only one who was good enough to make it into the major leagues yeah and he didn't judge he just worked harder and if all the other blacks at the time I just worked harder they would have made it into the major leagues no they were not allowed into the major leagues if you had a fair system I know for this mindset they think a fair system is I get all the spots my people the people that are like me get all the spots you get nothing and if you we allow you to take one spot you should thank me if we had no discrimination back then I don't know what percentage of the league would have been black half the liga third of the league a quarter of the league but it wouldn't have been one person that's a preposterous argument yeah and then finally the great irony that I'm sure he'd never occurred to him at all is here he is saying well why don't white people and gay people have all the spots well don't complain work harder and in this case there is no discrimination they can get all the spots they want they just have to be faster and stronger but instead of doing that what does John moody do he complaints yeah if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right
