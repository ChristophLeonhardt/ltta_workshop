PEOPLE ARE SITTING AND SQUATTING ON THE FENCE. OFFICIALS SAY SOME PEOPLE HAVE GONE OVER AND HAVE BEEN ARRESTED. FOR MORE ON THIS WE GO TO SOMEONE THAT HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES. THE FORMER DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO. AND DEFORMING US AS AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS. GOVERNOR, AMBASSADOR WOELFEL. THANK YOU, ERIC. CLASSROOM TALKING ABOUT WILL CREATE A MOMENT BUT FIRST YOUR REACTION TO THIS . I THINK WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS AND YOUR PREVIOUS GUESTS, VERY SENSIBLY TALKED ABOUT WE ARE SUBJECT TO AN INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON ASYLUM. I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EACH OF THESE CASES CASE BY CASE WITHIN THE INDIVIDUALLY AND THESE PEOPLE ARE FLEEING, MAINLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THERE ARE SOME ACTIVISTS FROM POLITICAL TURMOIL AND EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, NICARAGUA. THEY ARE SAYING THAT MANY OF THEIR LIVES ARE IN DANGER. I THINK THAT WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS RESPECT EACH CASE. NOT OVERRUN JUST BECAUSE THERE IS A CROWD. I HAVE SOME SUPPORTIVE ENTRIES IN NEW MEXICO. I HAVE DEALT WITH THE ISSUES. THINK OF TO DO WITH THEM WITHIN THE LAW AND THAT IS WHAT I SENSE THE HOMELAND SECURITY PEOPLE ARE DOING. BUT IF THERE IS A LEGITIMATE CASE, SOMEONE FLEEING FOR POLITICAL PERSECUTION OR THE FACT THAT THEY MAY BE TARGETED FOR MURDER, THEN I THINK THAT IS A SENSIBLE CASE BUT THERE ARE OTHERS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AND IT IS A VERY NARROW STANDARD AS YOUR PREVIOUS GUESTS MENTION. AND I HAVE BEEN DOWN TO SOME AND PARKED THERE IN THE CORNER. YOU CAN SEE IF YOU CANNOT STEP OVER YOU SHOULD NOT, IT IS ILLEGAL. YOU ARE TOLD NOT TO PAY BUT THEY SAY THAT IT IS A POLITICAL STUNT. BY ACTIVISTS MAYBE COACHING SOME OF THESE PEOPLE. SUPPORTERS SAY SCOTT IS AN EXAMPLE THAT YOU JUST RAISED. WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THOSE CRITICS WHO THINK THIS MAY BE TOO MUCH? IT IS AN ANNUAL EVENT. AND ON BOTH SIDES, THERE IS ACTIVISTS. THERE ACTIVISTS THAT SEE THIS HAPPEN AND SOME MAY BE I GUESS ATTORNEYS THAT WANT TO SPOTLIGHT THE ISSUE. THIS IS WHY I THINK THE LAW HAS TO BE OBSERVED. I THINK THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH AGENTS AND TECHNOLOGY TO DEAL WITH THIS. THE REALITY, I CAN SAY THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION HAS SLOWED DOWN. THIS CENTRAL AMERICA IMMIGRATION IS THE ONE THAT IS INCREASING. I THINK IT IS BEING LOOKED AT AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL. THE PRESIDENT, EVERY TIME HE GETS A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT THE WALL OR THIS, IT JUST INFLAMES THINGS. I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT BUT THAT IS MY CONCERN. NOW GO TO ANOTHER BOARD? WELL THIS IS GOING A PRODIGIOUSLY VIDEO TAPED YOU HAD BEEN NORTH KOREA AND NEGOTIATED WITH THEM PERSONALLY? WHAT DID YOU THINK OF KIM JONG-UN AND THE PRESIDENT MOON HOLDING HANDS? WALKING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE BORDERS. YOU THINK THIS IS GENUINE? YOU THINK YOU WANT TO POTENTIALLY SURRENDER THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM? WELL, I WAS VERY OVERWHELMS AND PLEASED AND IMPRESSED. I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT THEY BOTH STEPPING INTO EACH OTHER'S TERRITORY, LESSENING TENSIONS. BOTH COUNTRIES WATCHING THE EVENTS SO CLOSELY. THAT IS VERY GOOD. I'VE DEALT WITH THE NORTH KOREANS. THEY HAVE SOMETHING UP THEIR SLEEVE BUT SO FAR, YOU HAVE TO HAND IT TO KIM JONG-UN ALONE AND THE SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT. THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE SOME GOOD MOVES ALSO. BASICALLY SAYING THERE WAS SHUT DOWN NUCLEAR REACTOR, THEY ARE READY TO DENUCLEARIZE. THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS. THERE IS NO TIMELINE FROM THE SUMMIT. THERE IS NO SPECIFICITY. I'M JUST WORRIED THAT KIM JONG-UN ALONE RIGHT NOW IS WINNING THE PR BATTLE BUT WE HAVE GOT TO BE VERY CONSCIOUS THAT DENUCLEARIZATION FOR US MEANS DIFFERENTLY WHEN HE MEANS PAPER AS IT MEANS DISMANTLING OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THEN THEY GET SOME BENEFITS. FOR THE NORTH KOREANS BASICALLY DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS A PHRASE. THEY WILL CARR THEIR EXISTING USE. AS A LOT OF ISSUES TO NEGOTIATE ON THE TABLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO NEGOTIATE. I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO, THE SUMMIT IS GOOD LIVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WHAT SHOULD THE PRESIDENT DO? JOHN BOLTON SAID BASICALLY IF HE DOESN'T AGREE TO DENUCLEARIZE THEY POSSIBLY WILL NOT BE A MEETING. TO THE PRESIDENT SAY WE HAVE TO GIVE THE SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT MEET HIM AND THEN SAY YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM UP? YOU KNOW, HE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE HIS NEGOTIATING STYLE. I HAD HOPED THAT HE JUST LISTENED TO HIS SECRETARY OF STATE AND LET HIM HANDLE THIS. BUT THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THIS SUMMIT IS GOOD. IT SHOULD HAPPEN REGARDLESS. I THINK KIM JONG-UN HAS MADE ENOUGH POSITIVE STATEMENTS THAT IT IS WORTH TAKING A CHANCE. ON SAYING IS THAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM NEED TO BE PREPARED. THEY NEED TO GET THE THREE AMERICANS OUT. WE NEED TO GET THE REMAINS OF OUR SOLDIERS OUT. WE NEED ALSO TO FOCUS ON EXACTLY WHAT DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS. STOP SOME OF THE MISSILE TESTS THE CURRENT UNITED STATES. THAT THE CHEMICALS THAT COME TO SYRIA, MISSILE AND OTHER EXPORTS, NUCLEAR EXPERTS. I THINK IN SOUTH KOREA, THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB IN PAVING THE WAY. THE OTHER ONES ON THE FRONT LINES. 25 MILLION SOUTH KOREANS FACING A COMMERCIAL TECH TO THE FACT THAT THE SUMMIT TOOK PLACE, I KNOW PEOPLE ARE CRITICS, IS IT GOING TO WORK? AS FOR THE TIME BEING TENSION IS USED, THESE TWO CANS, AND HER NOSE WHAT KIM JONG-UN IS UP TO. THERE HAS TO BE REALLY VERIFICATION, REAL IN ANY AGREEMENT, REAL OVERSIGHT, WE HAVE TO INSPECT ALL OF THEIR SITES AND WEAPONS. SOME ARE HIDDEN. ACTUALLY MOST ARE HIDDEN. SO IT IS GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING BUT HAVE TO SAY, IT HAS NEVER BEEN AS GOOD AS IT HAS. AT LEAST HOPEFULNESS. AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE A LONG TIME. IT IS CERTAINLY ENCOURAGING. FINALLY, AUTO ONE BEER. THE STUDENT WAS BASICALLY TORTURED AND MURDERED. CAME BACK BRANDON. HERE COMES ALONE CHANGES, MATCHES THE DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME BASICALLY TO SOUTH KOREA. THE PRESIDENT BRING THE CASE TO KIM JONG-UN TO PROSECUTE THE KILLERS IN NORTH KOREA? WELL, YEAH. MY FOUNDATION TRIED TO GET HIM OUT AND OFFERED ALL KINDS OF THINGS. NOT AS EFFICIENT NEGOTIATIONS. THEY OWE INTONATION. WHAT HAPPENED TO OTTO WARMBIER? WHY DID HE COME BACK AND NOT GET PROPER TREATMENT? I THINK THERE HAS BEEN ACCOUNTABILITY. VERY GOOD PEOPLE TO FAMILY, THEY FILED A LAWSUIT. I THINK IT HAS TO GO THROUGH STUDENT PROCESS AND BUT, I THINK AT THE VERY LEAST, THE NORTH KOREANS SHOULD MAKE A VERY CONCRETE DECISION NEVER TO APPREHEND ANOTHER AMERICAN. AND THERE ARE THREE AMERICANS THAT ARE THERE RIGHT NOW APPREHENDED THAT SHOULD BE RELEASED. WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OTTO WARMBIER AND THE THREE AMERICANS THERE AS WELL AS TALKING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL
