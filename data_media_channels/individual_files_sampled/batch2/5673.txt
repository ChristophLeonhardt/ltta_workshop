I'm thankful that our committee voted the way that it did to move Mike Pompeo and a positive vote to the floor I am particular want to thank senator Coons for displaying the statesmanship I've been accustomed to seeing in the Senate and I'm proud of him I'm proud of our committee and I'm happy for the American people I think it showed that centers at the right time can do outstanding things that was Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman bob corker getting emotional discussing the decision by his Democratic colleague Chris Coons to vote present to advance Mike Pompeo Secretary of State nomination yesterday and Senator Coons joins us now and for those who might not get the politics of this who thought maybe you should have stuck to your guns tell us why you did that well Mika I really appreciate what chairman corker had to say afterwards to be clear I voted against Mike Pompeo in the committee and will vote against him on the floor but because of a Senate rule he couldn't advance from the committee to consideration by the full Senate unless a majority of senators present voted that way and my good friend Johnny Isakson had been at home in Georgia delivering a eulogy for his best friend that afternoon the only thing that my changing my vote to present did was change the hour of the vote if I hadn't done that senator Isakson would have been compelled to come to Washington last night he could have gotten in about 11:00 11:30 and we would have reconvened and he would have had to cast the same vote so it didn't change the outcome but it did change the timing and it was an opportunity for me to show a small measure of kindness and respect to a colleague in the Senate Jo so senator let me ask you about your your vote against Mike Pompeo I certainly can understand Democrats not feeling gracious towards the Republican majority that did wouldn't even talk to Merrick garland it was a shameful exercise speaking of a lack of in the Senate it was absolutely shameful and will be marked in the history books as such but if you look at this situation let's just talk about the merits you have in Mike Pompeo obviously somebody who's is bright educated the best and the brightest he served he served his country he's been an elected official so you know he's he's not he's not a radical that hasn't had to face voters he certainly is in within the mainstream of Republican orthodoxy in 2018 those same Republicans who were elected to control the Senate elected to control the house elected to control the White House and you have America's commander-in-chief saying that he needs Mike Pompeo as his Secretary of State and by the way a guy who would be far more connected apparently to Donald Trump than Rex Tillerson ever was and I would even argue than John Kerry at times was connected to Barack Obama so why would you vote against Mike Pompeo well Joe I think like all of my Democratic colleagues on the committee my vote was mostly driven by things Mike Pompeo said and did as a candidate for Congress and as a congressman in his conduct in the Benghazi hearings in statements he's made about regime change and in belligerent past statements he's made and in particular some statements he'd made about Muslim Americans and about the LGBT community but I agree with a number of the things you said Joe that a Secretary of State has to speak for the president should be someone who really advocates for the career professionals in the State Department and should be in the room with the president able to really advocate for diplomacy those are things that Rex Tillerson because of the bad chemistry he had with the president and his rural lack of connection to the State Department wasn't successful at at the end of the day my core concern was about whether or not Mike Pompeo will advocate for rule of law for human rights for democracy for our core values over principally be focused on using military force and on security concerns there's no doubt that he is smart and skilled and understands how Washington works and I am hopeful he'll be a successful Secretary of State but at the end of the day he was not someone I could support there are other Republicans I would gladly support like Foreign Relations Committee Chairman bob Corker all right well you talked about you talked about how things that he had said during his campaigns I think he made several clarifying statements before the committee but though I disagreed with some of the things that he did say that Democrats had concerns with as you know very well all the world's a stage and when you're running for office in Kansas you're you're you're taking on one role but if you wanted a better idea of how he would how he would carry himself you could look to his service at the CIA and all reports I've heard at least from the rank and file there is that he did a good job there he built morale at that institution it's a tough place to work shouldn't he be judged by what he did at the CIA and whether he could transfer those skills over to the State Department well Joe I think the majority in the committee voted based on their hope about how he will behave as Secretary of State based on just those factors how he led the CIA I think my concerns were about his long record of associating himself with and speaking on issues of values in ways that really don't reflect the best of American values and frankly more of my problems were with President Trump and his conduct of foreign policy it is encouraging to see that rather than tweets about fire and fury we are seeing a genuine diplomatic opening to North Korea there's a long way to go to actually accomplish denuclearization and to get Kim jong-un in North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons but Mike Pompeo and hopefully President Trump seemed to be making real progress in negotiating rather than threatening imminent attack on North Korea that's a positive there are many vacancies at the State Department and in our ambassadora posts around the world and I hope to have a chance to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the committee to move some of those folks forward most of these don't have nominations from the administration for the South Korean ambassador for example or the assistant secretary for the region for East Asia Pacific there's other things we have to be working on together and I'll remind you that this week the president of France Immanuel macaw is in town there will be a state dinner tonight there will be an address to Congress tomorrow and what he's pressing is for a president Trump not to pull us out of the Iran deal he sees clearly the threat that Iran presents to the region to Syria with its ballistic missile program it's human rights violations but my hope is that we won't pull out of that agreement and I wasn't convinced that Mike Pompeo sees Iran see Syria and sees that agreement the same way I do and at the end of the day I hope to be proven wrong I hope that Mike Pompeo will end up being a Secretary of State who does lead with our values and who does promote partnership with our allies Lilley senator Coons is willie Geist if you look at previous votes confirmation votes for secretaries of state Tillerson only received 56 but they go back before Trump both John Kerry and Hillary Clinton received 94 votes in the Senate condi rice received 85 votes in the Senate there are a lot of people who look at this confirmation and at tiller sins as well process and say Democrats are sending a message to Donald Trump that this is about president Trump and not the man who's being nominated for the position what do you say to that criticism that you want to knock on president Trump and that this isn't really about what kind of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be well I'll say there are other Republican leaders in foreign policy who could have been nominated who I think would have gotten 75 or 80 votes a fairly easily Stephen Hadley for example nikki Haley I mentioned bob Corker and others I do think that Rex Tillerson given his long and close association with Putin and with Russia and his leadership of ExxonMobil and the circumstances of the timing of his confirmation vote faced a number of headwinds and I think Mike Pompeo given some of his past statements we've already covered face some headwinds but more broadly Willie you're right that there is some broad concern in the Senate not just among Democrats about president Trump's conduct of foreign policy as a candidate he promised to be unpredictable and untraditional and he has certainly over performed in that category I'll remind you with regards to Syria we went with a president who a few weeks ago was tweeting it's time for us to pull out American troops - a president who carried out a military attack against Assad's regime big swings like that on major issues from North Korea to Syria to Iran to Russia have happened just in the past year and I think that has unsettled many of us on the Foreign Relations Committee and given us real concern Senator Chris Coons thank you so much for being on the
