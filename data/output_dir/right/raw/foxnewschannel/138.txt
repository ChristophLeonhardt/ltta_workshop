1
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:34,574
>> Sean: ANOTHER

2
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:35,008
INVESTIGATION?

3
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:35,742
THERE WAS NO COOPERATION IN THE

4
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:36,343
FIRST ONE.

5
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:36,643
NONE.

6
00:00:36,644 --> 00:00:38,745
>> IT'S NOT FUNNY, BUT IN A WAY

7
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:39,145
IT IS.

8
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:39,879
APPARENTLY ONE KICK OF THE MEAL

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,349
WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,049
SENATOR FEINSTEIN, WHO I LIKE

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,351
VERY MUCH.

12
00:00:44,352 --> 00:00:46,519
BUT HERE'S WHAT I WANT EVERY

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,520
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE IN THE

14
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:48,788
SENATE TO BE ASKED TOMORROW.

15
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,790
DO YOU AGREE WITH DIANNE

16
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,525
FEINSTEIN?

17
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:54,127
IF DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL OF THE

18
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:55,895
SENATE, ARE YOU FOR REOPENING

19
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:57,097
THE KAVANAUGH INVESTIGATION?

20
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,199
ARE YOU FOR MORE HUMILIATION,

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,334
GRADING TREATMENT OF THIS FINE

22
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:02,936
MAN, OR YOU FOR CONTINUING THIS

23
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:03,770
DEBACLE?

24
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:05,238
DO YOU AGREE WITH DIANNE

25
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:05,605
FEINSTEIN?

26
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:06,306
IF YOU GET IN CHARGE OF THE

27
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:07,173
SENATE DEMOCRATS HE WILL GO

28
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:09,743
AFTER KAVANAUGH AGAIN.

29
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:11,444
I THINK EVERY VOTER IN ALL THESE

30
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:12,779
TRUMP STATES THAT HAVE

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,314
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS NEED TO ASK

32
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:16,750
THAT QUESTION, ARE YOU WITH

33
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:17,517
DIANE OR NOT?

34
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:18,685
>> Sean: WE'VE BEEN TALKING A

35
00:01:18,686 --> 00:01:21,254
LOT ABOUT HILLARY COMMENTS, KICK

36
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:24,357
HIM ERIC HOLDER.

37
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:26,259
TWO POLITICIANS, REPUBLICANS IN

38
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,294
MINNESOTA HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED

39
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,528
AND PUNCHED.

40
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:30,930
ONE GUY SEVERELY INJURED, A

41
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:32,732
WOMAN PUNCHED.

42
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:36,536
MAXINE WATERS, CREATE A CROWD.

43
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:38,805
FOLLOW THEM INTO GROCERY STORES,

44
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:39,673
GAS STATIONS.

45
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:43,343
DEPARTMENT STORES.

46
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:45,578
THEY ARE NOT WANTED ANYWHERE

47
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:46,746
ANYMORE.

48
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:48,048
SHE'S GOING TO BE A LEADER IF

49
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,717
THEY TAKE BACK THE HOUSE?

50
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:52,919
>> I THINK THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

51
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,054
>> Sean: AND YOU WERE SPAT AT

52
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:57,157
BY THE WAY.

53
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,158
>> THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,526
CAN'T WIN AT THE BALLOT BOX.

55
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:01,761
YOU TAKE THOSE OF US WHO DID WIN

56
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:02,462
A NEW TRY TO INTIMIDATE US IN

57
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:04,731
BENDING TO YOUR WILL.

58
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:08,335
I'VE NEVER HAD POLICE SECURITY

59
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,336
BEFORE, CAPITOL HILL POLICE

60
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:10,169
PROTECT ME EVER BEFORE UNTIL THE

61
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,006
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS.

62
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,774
HAD A GUY WHO WOULD NOT LET THE

63
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:15,241
ELEVATOR CLOSE.

64
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:17,143
I HAD TO GO TO MY OFFICE AND

65
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:17,911
SOMEBODY ON THE ELEVATOR PUSHED

66
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:18,912
HIM OUT.

67
00:02:18,913 --> 00:02:20,613
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE

68
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:20,914
DONE.

69
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:22,449
I HAD A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AROUND

70
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,019
ME FILMING ME, YELLING AT ME,

71
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,387
ALL OVER MY JACKET.

72
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:28,321
IT WAS PRETTY BAD AND I CAN ONLY

73
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:29,089
IMAGINE WHAT MY OTHER COLLEAGUES

74
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,524
WENT THROUGH.

75
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:33,193
SO THIS IS ON THE BALLOT.

76
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,762
WHAT YOU WANT AMERICA TO LOOK

77
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:36,062
LIKE?

78
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:36,830
ONCE THE ELECTION IS OVER DO YOU

79
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:39,666
WANT THOSE WHO LOST TO TRY TO

80
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,534
PHYSICALLY ASSAULT THOSE WHO

81
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:44,337
WON, OR DO YOU WANT TO HAVE AN

82
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:45,538
ELECTION ONCE IT'S OVER WE TRY

83
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:46,639
TO WORK TOGETHER AND GOVERN THE

84
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,742
COUNTRY?

85
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:49,909
>> Sean: IS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD

86
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,377
BE ABOUT?

87
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,945
AT THE END OF THE DAY AND

88
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:52,779
WILLING TO LISTEN TO ANY

89
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,147
DEMOCRAT, TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE

90
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:57,517
GOING TO DUKE TO CREATE JOBS.

91
00:02:57,518 --> 00:02:58,918
TEN YEARS WORKING IN RESTAURANTS

92
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,320
STARTING AS A DISHWASHER.

93
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:01,221
TEN YEARS IN CONSTRUCTION

94
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,524
STARTING AS A HOUSE PAINTER.

95
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:05,892
ROOFING FOLLOWING THREE STORIES,

96
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:06,459
THAT'S MY BACKGROUND.

97
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,161
YOU GREW UP IN A BAR.

98
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:10,563
AND YOU HAD THE SAME KIND OF

99
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:12,031
BACKGROUND.

100
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:15,368
WE NOW HAVE 4 MILLION NEW JOBS,

101
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,035
400,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS,

102
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:19,739
BETTER TRADE DEALS, LESS

103
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,341
REGULATION, A PATH TO ENERGY

104
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:22,542
INDEPENDENCE, THE BIGGEST TAX

105
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:24,411
CUT IN HISTORY, SECURING THE

106
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,980
BORDER, NORTH KOREA.

107
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,149
THINKING, WOW.

108
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,752
THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE HERE.

109
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:35,321
>> ISRAEL IS SAFER, ISIS IS

110
00:03:35,322 --> 00:03:35,789
BEING DESTROYED.

111
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,157
PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED A QUESTION

112
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:39,058
IN 2016, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO

113
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:39,359
LOSE?

114
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,594
AND MOST PEOPLE SAID NOT MUCH.

115
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:42,862
THEY SAW NO HOPE WITH

116
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:43,329
HILLARY CLINTON.

117
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,665
LET ME TELL YOU IN 2018 IF THE

118
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,466
DEMOCRATS TAKE OVER YOU'VE GOT A

119
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:49,969
LOT TO LOSE.

120
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:50,837
I WANT EVERY DEMOCRAT RUNNING

121
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:52,138
FOR THE SENATE TO ANSWER THE

122
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,139
QUESTION DO YOU AGREE WITH

123
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,441
DIANNE FEINSTEIN THAT WE SHOULD

124
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,209
REOPEN THE KAVANAUGH

125
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,378
INVESTIGATION IF DEMOCRATS TAKE

126
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,145
OVER?

127
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:01,014
>> Sean: DON'T THEY WANT TO

128
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:01,347
IMPEACH?

129
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:03,249
THEY WANT TO IMPEACH THE GUY.

130
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,083
>> IF YOU'RE RUNNING FOR THE

131
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:05,351
HOUSE IS A DEMOCRAT, DO YOU

132
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:06,286
AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT THE

133
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:06,986
FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO IS

134
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:09,022
IMPEACH KAVANAUGH?

135
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:10,490
THESE ANSWERS TELL YOU A LOT

136
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:14,060
ABOUT THE PERSON RUNNING.

137
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:14,794
SO THEY NEED TO -- ARE YOU WITH

138
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:17,330
DIANE OR NOT.

139
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:18,331
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE PLEASED

140
00:04:18,332 --> 00:04:19,732
THAT WE GOT A GOOD CONSERVATIVE

141
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:22,669
JUSTICE, THEY ARE READY TO MOVE

142
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:22,936
ON.

143
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:23,603
>> Sean: THERE WAS ONLY ONE

144
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:25,305
DEMOCRAT THAT WAS WILLING TO LET

145
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:30,477
DUE PROCESS, THE PRESUMPTION OF

146
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,744
INNOCENCE.

147
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:33,947
>> I WANT TO SEE WHO THESE OTHER

148
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:35,081
DEMOCRATS ARE LISTENING TO.

149
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:36,549
CLEARLY THEY DIDN'T LISTEN TO

150
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,717
THE PEOPLE OF THEIR STATE.

151
00:04:37,718 --> 00:04:40,920
BUT IF I AM IN CHARGE AS A

152
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:42,088
REPUBLICAN, SENATOR GRASSLEY DID

153
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,157
A WONDERFUL JOB BUT I MAY BE THE

154
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,391
CHAIRMAN IF HE MOVES TO FINANCE.

155
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:48,261
I PROMISE YOU THIS, WE ARE GOING

156
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:49,796
TO INVESTIGATE WHO BETRAYED

157
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:50,163
DR. FORD.

158
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,531
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHY HER

159
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:53,166
LAWYERS DID NOT TELL HER THAT

160
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,300
THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE GONE TO

161
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:56,536
CALIFORNIA TO INTERVIEW HER IN

162
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:58,605
PRIVATE SO SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO

163
00:04:58,606 --> 00:04:59,038
THROUGH THIS.

164
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:00,139
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO

165
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,540
INVESTIGATE.

166
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,275
>> Sean: I THINK YOU'RE ONE OF

167
00:05:02,276 --> 00:05:04,978
YOUR FINEST MOMENTS IN YOUR

168
00:05:04,979 --> 00:00:00,000
CAREER STANDING UP FOR TRUTH.
