it's a year since Emmanuel macron was inaugurated as the president of France but for many in the country his reforms have fallen short of expectations he's also accused of cronyism and running a virtual monarchy in Paris thousands marched against macrons pro-business economic reforms the protesters say the changes represent an assault on workers rights it's just the latest in a series of rallies across France in recent months the number of which have been marred by violence and clashes with police president Makran is now under even more pressure following the knife attack in Paris on Saturday night a man of Chechen origin stabbed one person to death and injured four others in the French capital he was then shot dead by police Islamic state earlier released a video allegedly showing the attacker pledged allegiance to the terrorist group our correspondent Charlotte Dubinsky has more on macrons turbulent first year in office discontentment on the streets violent confrontations force used to subdue protesters this is France one year into macarons first term in office 12 months ago microrna stood here to much fanfare he had just won the election he was riding on hi little did he know perhaps that his real battle was just about to begin reforming the working code provoked a backlash that macron pushed ahead four workers went on strike everything is done to benefit the rich to give funds and subsidies to big companies the multinationals he's an ultra liberal who thinks about his bosses his friends but on about the small people said that he's against everyone who works against the pensioners against the students some also argue that macron has consolidated and concentrated power and by hand picking his MPs who now have outright control of the National Assembly he has ensured that his way is the only way even grassroots members of his own party have voiced frustration with his leadership saying it's not inclusive and their opinions don't count many are also unhappy that he's bypassed Parliament to push through some reforms by decree rather than a vote meanwhile McCune has said he's proud of his choices and hates having to constantly explain his reasoning get us off SATA during attack it's a catastrophic is the general attack on everything that makes up the French identity and its history it means everything we've succeeded in constructing over the centuries he has chucked it out it's been thrown in the Benham shkoder knows every announcement every new law that's prepared encroaches a little more in our democracy whether it be on the judicial level or business level or concerning constitutional reform if he's bringing down all the values of the French Republic turned his back on them the way the system's set up is it sometimes described as a Republican monarchy and that was how it was conceived and how it's meant to be run it's meant to give France strong authoritative but not authoritarian leadership but I don't think it's he's undemocratic there is you know counterbalance to his to his power many in France same a corn is like a king who doesn't understand his subjects his supporters say he's carrying out the pledges that he was elected on and unlike his predecessors he isn't backing down to social pressure but with another four years left to go one former president has given Macomb a warning those who say that people are looking for a king should never forget they're in a country where the monarch had his head cut off we asked the presidential administration to respond to the accusation of his critics but they declined to respond Charlotte Dubinsky RT Paris you
