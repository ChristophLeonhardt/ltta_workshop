is there any senator in the chamber wishing to vote or wishing to change their vote if not the yeas are 98 the nays are 1 the motion is agreed to I'll soon signed into law the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis robbed and and so many others help very little Democrat support okay earlier this month the Senate passed a sweeping bipartisan bill to fight the opioid epidemic it was opposed by just one member a Republican yet according to Donald Trump the ninety eight to one vote translates to quote very little Democratic support it's a question we asked again and again why is Trump incapable of telling obvious truths good morning and welcome to morning Joe it is Monday October 22nd with us we have MSNBC contributor Mike Barnicle national affairs analyst for NBC News and MSNBC and co-host and executive producer of Showtime's the circus John Heilemann columnist at the Washington Examiner kristin Soltis anderson national political correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC and author of the book the red and the blue the 1990s and the birth of political tribalism Steve Kornacki and historian and author of the soul of America the soul of America himself Rogers professor of the presidency at Vanderbilt University and NBC News and MSNBC contributor Jon the bottom of Bell meet all right Joe we start this morning again fighting for just the truth just the facts just getting the facts well right you know we that actually while it's easy to ask what what exactly is wrong with Donald Trump Jon Meacham when you have something to pass 98 to one pass 98 to one and it is about as bipartisan as anything can ever be only one Republican voted against it John you actually have Donald Trump it's John there do we have John there yeah let well why don't we go to Jon Meacham he's the the soul of America he can speak to this much better there is Jon Meacham you you actually have the president who has a chance to talk about bringing Washington together the sort of thing that presidents in the past would love to do here instead you have a president who actually lies about the fact that he had a 98 to 1 vote which I guess you tell me what does that do does that speak to the fact that he's just a lot more interested in dividing Americans than bringing them together and where's the chance to talk about how America comes together he still lies and suggests that it's torn apart he's fighting for the next five minutes not for not even the next five weeks much less the next five years or the next five decades basically he's gonna keep doing this because he's been rewarded for it he's the president's from those of his supporters I think he thinks of us as an audience not as a country and is happy to have in the professional wrestling sense the people who boo him he thinks are booing him partly because it's their role I don't think he takes on any kind of constructive criticism and so I think we're where we are is we we have a president who now or has for quite a long time he's incapable of changing because the way he's acted has been rewarded and I think that the only thing people can do at this point and it's not that I don't mean to minimize it by saying only but we have two weeks and one day before a significant message can be said that we believe truth should have a place in the arena along with this kind of passion yeah what a wonderful thing make it actually bring truth into the arena and well you know we've been focused so much in Donald Trump I gotta say I think it's time to start focusing on the people behind him who were applauding at lines that they know where lies yeah because you can ask a Donald Trump well is he is is he just is he incompetent does he is he evil is he and sent we we don't know why he would lie about something then but we know it continues but it continues right so but but the question is when Donald Trump States an obvious lie and people cheer at it like it's a punch line or like it's a touchdown being scored when he's lying when he's not telling her than they're laughing about it and they're cheering about our let's say last week when Donald Trump praised the assault of a reporter who was beaten up and thrown to the ground for simply asking a question about health care reform the audience behinds Donald Trump is cheering and laughing and apply I just wanted who raised them first of all who raised those people that are cheering and laughing when a president applauded somebody being beaten up and battered a reporter for asking a question about health care apparently again forgetting what happened to Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia who raised them what church did they go to growing up they still go to church every week do they go to church on Sundays and then Mondays they applaud somebody beating up the press we're asking you a question about health care reform what eight other children at night about the type of character they wanted to have CeCe you can't cheer about somebody committing assault and battery and beating up somebody and throwing them to the ground you can't cheer on lies that you know to be lies and then go home and try to teach your child anything you just can't because they will see that you're the hypocrite create standing behind the president cheering him on and laughing as he applauds assault and battery as he lies about the most basic facts as he tears the shreds one constitutional norm after another now it may seem like this is all above your children it's not I have poor they're a lot smarter than you think they are and I'm just wondering what do you do when you go home from that rally applauding what's going applauding of the lies applauding the assaults the applauding the abuse is appalled applauding the vulgarities it's a question mica I think we need to start asking a lot more staring up are the people that continue to applaud things they know to be blocked don't know if they see it as lies or if they see it as a show
