<font color="#E5E5E5">the other one was not really focused in</font>

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,210
the meeting I do think this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think from</font>

16
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,210
a practical<font color="#CCCCCC"> standpoint most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people would</font>

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,640
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken that meeting it's called</font>

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,620

I have only been in<font color="#E5E5E5"> politics for two</font>

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,219
years but I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people call up</font>

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,920
oh gee we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> information on this</font>

24
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:05,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's very standard in politics</font>

25
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,439
politics is not the nicest business in

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,909
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world but it's very standard where</font>

lasted for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very short</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> period</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

32
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,750
nothing came of the meeting and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

33
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,189
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting that most people in</font>
