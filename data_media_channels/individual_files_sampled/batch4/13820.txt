whenever someone points out that feminism is a toxic and destructive philosophy some feminists always says that's not real feminism real feminism is something other than the toxic and destructive philosophy feminism actually is so what is feminism really feminism is a sore point that emerges from time to time as a result of the relations between men and women now wait that's herpes no it's feminism now hold on that's herpes right more feminism now what's the difference let's move on ever since time began human beings have found their chief consolation and joy in the love between a man and a woman and their chief purpose and meaning in the indispensable care and tenderness of being a mother and homemaker and the responsibilities and authority of being a father and provider feminism is an attempt to put an end to all that so that unhappy neurotics can parade around in stupid pink hats screaming about something god knows what feminists feel that for too long men have gotten away with having sex with women and getting them pregnant and marrying them and then making sure they and their children have a roof over their head and food to eat even if it means the man has to work until his fingers bleed and compromises dreams and principles so that his children can have the all-important presence of a full-time mother in their lives and it's just not fair to women for some reason feminists believe that men are grotesque foul-mouthed Phil mannered bullies who treat women as if they were nothing more than vaginas and they feel a feminists can do all that just as well as any man feminists are angry that some men treat sex is a fleeting meaningless physical pleasure and they feel that women should treat sex the same way and then wake up feeling disgusted with themselves and then blame men for their sense of shame not to mention their incurable STD and the baby they have to abort so that now they'll spend the rest of their lives distorting their own sense of morality in order to avoid facing up to what they've done then everything will be fair feminists believe that women and men have exactly the same capabilities and it's me societal oppression that causes men to be better at math and science and women to be better at knowing that a twelve-year-old has been doing something he wasn't supposed to be doing even before he comes to the freakin door for heaven's sake feminists are sick and tired of being treated like children who need a man to take care of them and demand to be treated like children who need the government to take care of them feminists believe that men have created a world of unfettered capitalism unbridled aggression and constant warfare and they want to fight that by making money acting tough and serving in combat in general feminists believe that men are bad and women are good and women should be men and will then be bad which will then be good so basically feminism is completely irrational women trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show
