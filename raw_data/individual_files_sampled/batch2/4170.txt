let's go to Cal Perry who's in Wilmington North Carolina what Cal as you said ally we've been talking about this all day Wilmington is now an island this community is cut off from the rest of the state we're in the Carolina Pines area the Carolina Place area excuse me this neighborhood took it really hard I want to bring in hunter who's here trying to help clean up trying to help get people back into their houses it seems like this neighborhood took it really bad what are you seeing yes sir we see a lot of large trees on homes and they require a 40-ton crane to lift the tree off the house and of course once you do that you leave a lot of holes in the roof and to keep the water out we got to put up a temporary barrier which is usually just a tarp to keep the rain out you came from Florida yes sir we're from Jacksonville Florida where did you write out the storm we write up the storm just outside of Wilmington and Whitesville and then once the storm weakened we made our way across 74 and end of Wilmington where did get a house or oh no we stayed outside of a Walmart parking lot we have our RVs and our heavy equipment we just stationed it around it to keep us safe thank you thank you Hunter very much listen Ally one of the things that we're learning here is people like Hunter had to bring their gas with them right 150 gallons of gas yes did you grow with them that's a big problem here those gas stations opened up yesterday very quickly there was a run on the gas and now those gas stations are running out of gas so it's gonna be the focus in the next two days getting people out who want to get out of Wilmington you can't get down those highways because those highways are basically rivers and getting those rescue workers in here to take care of houses like this Ali Callie you and I were there a few days ago together and he's shortly after the hurricane when everybody thought it was over you could still get out you could get you I think you had seen a couple of gas stations open maybe it was late Saturday night or Sunday and then as you say they run out of gas and when you see those highways when they're not waterlogged you see coming into the hurricane area convoys of those bucket trucks that cut the trees down and and and work on power lines and kanwa convoys that are carrying gasoline the roads flooded you can't get that stuff in right now what are their ways to get out at all and get the supplies and gasoline in or are we just gonna have to wait till the flood recedes not this morning and not today but as you said yesterday there was a window and it was about a 12-hour window we saw people being moved around from shelter to shelter on public school buses the authorities took advantage of that window they got some supplies in but as you said you've got these staging areas north of Wilmington where people were waiting to come in that window just open for a very short period of time it has now shut again because as we hear from our reporters across the region that rivers still rising and it's got about another 12 hours to do so Ali Kell thanks very much hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest interviews and highlights you can get more MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
