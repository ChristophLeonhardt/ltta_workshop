Reporter: HEY, DANA, THAT'S RIGHT. SEVERAL THOUSAND PROTESTERS STARTED AT THE FEDERAL COURTHOUSE, WALKED DOWN TO THE MALL TO THE SUPREME COURT. LET ME LOOK AT THIS LARGE CROWD. THEY CALL THEMSELVES CANCEL KAVANAUGH. IT'S LARGELY A WOMEN'S MARCH GROUP. SEVERAL DIFFERENT WOMEN'S GROUPS. THEY HAVE BEEN SPEAKING. BEFORE THEY STARTED TO WATCH, SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN RALLIED THE GROUP, MENTIONING SHE NEEDS TO TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS ENTIRE PROTEST IS FOR A SELECT GROUP OF SENATORS THOSE GOP HOLDOUTS, COLLINS, MURKOWSKI AND FLAKE. WE SEE THIS DYING OUT HERE. WHAT WAS YOUR NAME? LISA. Reporter: WHY ARE YOU OUT HERE? IS THIS INTENDED FOR THE GOP FENCE SITTING SENATORS? YES. WOMEN NEED TO SUPPORT WOMEN. MEN NEED TO SUPPORT WOMEN. KAVANAUGH HAS PROVEN THAT HE IS NOT READY FOR THE SUPREME COURT. VOTE HIM DOWN. Reporter: DID SENATOR COLLINS COME OUT HERE AT ANY POINT OR MURKOWSKI? NO. NO, THEY HAVE NOT COME OUT. Reporter: WELL, THERE YOU GO IT. I'LL SHOW YOU THIS IS A GROUP OF SPEAKERS THAT HAS BEEN ALTERNATING ABOUT EVERY TWO OR THREE MINUTES. IT WAS CERTAINLY LIVELY, ENERGETIC AND ALSO CHANTING GOING ON. THEY GOT HERE. THEY WANT THEIR MESSAGE HEARD.
