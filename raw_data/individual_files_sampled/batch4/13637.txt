okay I have to show you one more thing that I hate but also kind of love so this is thanks to Colton Colton is one of the people he's Employee of the Month here at daily wire a prestigious title that comes along with a little note that goes in a frame but Colton was walking around the office showing this to people which begs the question is what he's doing in his off hours but apparently he saw this this tape on YouTube and decided that I had to see it apparently there is something called ponying that happens I guess this is in New Orleans which apparently is a weird place and let's just play it because there are very few words that can describe what's happening here we're out here having a pony play competition where people compete in events and classes just the same as a pony fetish festival these Pony play hobbyists in New Orleans Louisiana dress up and compete in showjumping events dressed from head to toe in horse gear into what they call Pony space Ponies people that once they put the gear on that actually turn into horses when I put the bit in his mouth it's like a ritual between us he needs that transition to get into headspace and I can feel through the bits when he actually kind of changes from a human space to like plenty space before we take him out and for the reigning competition because I found for us during play if I just put him in the gear yeah and then we go immediately do it hmm it doesn't give him time to transition into his head space that allows him to express himself as a pony okay so just to be clear folks if you're not watching this it's not just that they're dressed up in like full-on horror suits they're not they're dressed up in basically the gimp suit from from pulp fiction dressed as ponies in GIMP suits walking around competing kicking carts yeah so here's the thing here's the thing can we who are we to judge can we judge and who are we to say that these people are not actual ponies that's the real question they've entered the pony space they are now ponies so you know here's the real question you know if they say there are pony who are you to say they are not a pony who are you according you need to find them what makes you so sis human what makes you what why can't they go by their preferred pronouns right they can be nay who knows any pronoun they choose why not who how dare you sir how dare you madam how dare she you know you that this these are legitimate ponies these are just as real as the ponies that you would see at a ranch somewhere okay and if they choose to run out there with the ponies if they choose to poop in the fields and if they choose if they choose to use bit and bridle well then that is their problem and you sitting there laughing at them judging at them they don't need your scorn they're in your scorn your bullying is what is causing them their suffering it is it is you do you understand it is your fault you it's society's intolerance that creates these sorts of situations where beautiful stunning poetic horses like this have to be they have to be let let free only far from the city why can't they live among us why can't we have beautiful pristine animals creatures of God like this among us in the city why not weenie horses are all part of our lives why okay so you know I think that it's a I would also say that there is a sad side to to pony space so the sad side to pony space is that when they break their legs you have to shoot them and that's that's the real sad side here because you know if they were human and they broken like you just take them to the hospital but if they're if they're in the ponies space when they break their legs they cannot be healed there are now ponies and you actually have to put them down for our own sake because the legs are not going to heal I mean I suppose you could try to do like they did with that racehorse a few years ago and likes to set suspend them in a pool for a month or something but are they really worth the trouble most horses are not running at the Kentucky Derby so I don't know but this is it's it's very you know it's disturbing that we would be so intolerant that we wouldn't take them seriously that we would not take their hobbies seriously you know these are I loves they say they have to be vanilla upright citizens Monday through Friday so to get out and pretend to be something else is so much fun but they're not pretending even this woman doesn't understand the reality of the pony space understand the reality of the pony space respect the pony space and if you've seen one of these ponies on the street out of the goodness of your heart give them a carrot and a lump of sugar
