IS THIS ONE OF THE STEIN  --

4
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:20,361
SIGNS OF THE APOCALYPSE?

BEST-SELLING AUTHOR RAYMOND

ARROYO.

10
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:37,444
LET'S HOPE THAT'S NOT A FATHER'S

11
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:37,945
DAY TREND.

12
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:40,381
WHAT'S UP, RAYMOND?

13
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:44,518
>>  I'VE GOT TO START WITH THIS

14
00:00:44,518 --> 00:00:45,519
BIBLE MANIA.

15
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:47,688
EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE SOUTHERN

16
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:50,891
BAPTIST CONVENTION AND THE

17
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:55,929
CATHOLIC BISHOPS CHASTISED THE

18
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,931
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR

19
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:01,268
IMMIGRATION POLICY.

20
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:02,569
SAYING, ST. PAUL TELLS US YOU

21
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:10,210
HAVE TO OBEY THE LAW.

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:10,511
LOOK.

23
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:12,446
>>  WE ACTUALLY DID DIG THROUGH

24
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:16,684
THE BIBLE TO FIND PASSAGES THAT

25
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:18,118
LENT THEMSELVES TO THE CURRENT

26
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:20,554
BORDER PRACTICE OF SEPARATING

27
00:01:20,554 --> 00:01:22,356
MIGRANT CHILDREN FROM THEIR

28
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:23,057
PARENTS.

29
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:25,859
I WANT TO BEGIN WITH MATTHEW 14.

30
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,628
BUT JESUS SAID, SUFFER LITTLE

31
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:28,929
CHILDREN AND FORBID THEM NOT TO

32
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:31,865
COME UNTO ME.

33
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:34,568
>>  WHO IS FORBIDDING CHILDREN

34
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:36,236
TO COME TO JESUS?

35
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:37,438
THIS IS CONFLATING THE SCRIPTURE

36
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,842
AND TURNING IT INTO A PUBLIC

37
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:42,910
POLICY THAT IT WAS NEVER INTEND

38
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,311
TO BE.

39
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:46,246
>>  HOW LONG DID THE BIBLE

40
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:47,247
READING GO ON?

41
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:48,949
>>  NO, NO, NO.

42
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:53,354
THIS WENT ON AND ON.

43
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:55,756
HE LOOKED LIKE A THEOLOGIAN,

44
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:56,056
LOOK.

45
00:01:56,056 --> 00:01:57,424
>>  I'M NOT FINISHED THIS.

46
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:00,361
LET'S GO TO ISAIAH 10.

47
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:03,897
WOE UNTO THEM THAT DECREE

48
00:02:03,897 --> 00:02:06,300
UNRIGHTEOUS DECREES.

49
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,669
>>THAT ONE'S INTERESTING.

50
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,472
BUT THAT'S AN OLD TESTAMENT

51
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:12,039
READING.

52
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,208
IS HE SUGGESTING WE SHOULD

53
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,110
FOLLOW GOD'S COMMANDS AND THE

54
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,245
KINGS FOLLOW HIS ORDERS?

55
00:02:18,245 --> 00:02:19,413
I DON'T THINK SO.

56
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:20,447
LOOK, THIS POLICY SEPARATING

57
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:22,149
PARENTS HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS

58
00:02:22,149 --> 00:02:22,683
FOR YEARS.

59
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:26,487
THEY DID IT DURING THE OBAMA AND

60
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:27,921
BUSH ADMINISTRATION.

61
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:29,623
NOW THEY'RE SAYING GOD WOULDN'T

62
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:32,709
WANT THERE

63
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:33,026
WANT THER

64
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:33,060
WANT  HER

65
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,093
WANT  THR

66
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:33,127
WANT  THIS

67
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:33,360
WANT  THIS.

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,528
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS GOD

69
00:02:34,528 --> 00:02:36,130
WOULDN'T WANT.

70
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:43,370
>>  ALL THE CATHOLIC CHURCHES --

71
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,205
>>WE HAVE TO GET INTO THE

72
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:47,040
EXPLOSION OF MEN WHO ARE DOING

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,642
PLASTIC SURGERY, OKAY?

74
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:50,210
>>  I KNEW YOU WOULD WANT GO

75
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,544
HERE.

76
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:53,347
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY.

77
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,048
>>  I LOVE THIS SEGMENT.

78
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:56,650
WHAT ARE THE MOST POPULAR TYPES

79
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,054
OF PLASTIC SURGERY FOR THE

80
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:02,790
METROSEXUAL MEN OUT THERE WITH

81
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,028
THEIR SKINNY JEANS, MAN BUNS,

82
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:09,296
AND MAN PURSES?

83
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:11,698
>>  THE FIRST IS KNOWS

84
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:14,835
RESHAPING, THEN EYELID SURGERY,

85
00:03:14,835 --> 00:03:15,869
LIPOSUCTION, BREAST REDUCTION

86
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:17,271
WAS NUMBER FOUR.

87
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:20,407
>>  WHAT?

88
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:20,908
BREAST REDUCTION?

89
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:22,676
>>  HAIR TRANSPLANTS WERE AT THE

90
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:23,010
BOTTOM.

91
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,746
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE AT THE

92
00:03:25,746 --> 00:03:26,013
TOP.

93
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:27,915
BREAST REDUCTIONS TOP IT.

94
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:30,217
I DON'T NEED HELP THERE JUST

95
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:30,484
YET.

96
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:33,454
>>  WHEN PEOPLE SAY THE WORD

97
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:35,289
MOOB, IS THAT WHAT THEY'RE

98
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:35,823
TALKING ABOUT?

99
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:36,156
OKAY.

100
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:37,758
SO MEN JUST WANT --

101
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:38,892
>>I HOPE NOT.

102
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:42,629
>>  IT'S NOT AN AUGMENTATION.

103
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,466
IT'S A REDUCTION.

104
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:53,273
>>  THEY ARE REDUCING THE MAN

105
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:56,810
BOOBAGE.

106
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,213
KRAFT CHEESE.

107
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:01,248
CAN YOU IMAGINING DOING A

108
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:03,684
PROMOTION LIKE THIS FOR MOTHER'S

109
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:05,352
DAY, SAYING MOM IS CHEESY?

110
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:06,520
I DOUBT IT.

111
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,290
I HATE THIS DIMINISHMENT OF DAD.

112
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,628
I SAW PLANET FITNESS PUT OUT A

113
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:20,132
CALENDAR OF DAD BODS.

114
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:22,101
IT'S FATHER'S DAY.

115
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:24,338
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE MEN AND

116
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:24,671
FATHERS.

117
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:28,342
>>  CELEBRATE FATHERS, MALE ROLE

118
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:29,309
MODELS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY

119
00:04:29,309 --> 00:00:00,000
WHO ACT AS FATHERS.
