right-wing smear attacks have already begun against the students who not only experienced the carnage in parkland Florida following that mass shooting but students who have the audacity to speak out against the gun laws or the lacs gun laws that we have in place now these right-wingers are claiming that these students who are using their voices to spread the message of gun control are not actual students they're really actors paid actors so the conspiracy theory is that some of the students are crisis actors paid performers funded by familiar boogie men like George Soros to vilify gun ownership and dismantle the Second Amendment so one example is Benjamin Kelly he's actually an aide for a lawmaker in Florida Kelly the aide sent Times reporter Alex Leary an email claiming Marjory Stoneman Douglas students emma gonzalez and david hog were not actual students but actors kelly from his official florida state legislature email account told leery that both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crises when they happen okay well he lost his job as a result of that ridiculous email so it's an interesting moment in Republican politics because Republican Party is now the conspiracy theory party so all the pizza gate stuffs from over there every shooting there's some sort of conspiracy theory about how it was someone else and it was staged and it was this and it was that President Trump brags about going on Alex Jones Show and the 80% gorillas 80 percent pig eye birds that they've got going on there etc so some portion of Republican Party and in not an insignificant portion have lost their minds so now they're all encouraged to come out now because they're like oh the president is also a conspiracy theorist he's the one that did the birth of theory and the list goes on so it is interesting to note that I guess this this massacre was bad enough in Florida that even Republican leaders in the state were like that's a little too far and not right now so they fired him which I give them credit for so there's a little bit of a battle within the Republican Party as to whether to just simply let the lunatics take over or let their inner lunatic out or to say no there is actually a bridge too far and apparently this was it in Florida right and by the way if you watch Fox News if you listen to Patriot radio on Sirius XM and listen to the Breitbart show on Sirius XM you will hear these conspiracy theories perpetuated they will literally attack the students who themselves experience this mass shooting who literally saw their peers get shot and killed in front of their very eyes they will attack them and then by the way turn around and do commentary on stories involving reproductive rights and how abortion is murder or they'll turn around and talk about oh don't ever politicize a mass shooting because you need to let the victims grieve unless the victims are grieving in a way that they don't like in which case you should smear them and try to destroy their lives and make up conspiracy theories these are kids these are kids they're kids and I mean and by the way Donald Trump jr. like to tweet with this particular conspiracy about how they're paid actors I mean at the highest levels they have lost their minds and and it is not equal it is not equal one side has lost track of reality the other side might have its issues and I mean the Democrats is a party of a million issues but they're not insane they're annoying they're establishment they're Pro status quo they're slowly you know helping to keep our wages down but they're not lunatics they're corrupt there's no question about that but but the Republicans are corrupt and lunatics so look again not all of them because here they did the right thing leadership in Florida did the right thing they got rid of rid of the guy but it goes all the way to up to Donald Trump jr. and it goes to all their media where they get their news they get their news from these insane websites so who's spreading this stuff again Infowars again gateway pundit so they I don't know that there is a conservative website in the country that doesn't put out continual stream of lies there's no like what's in the old days can I just say I'm sorry okay in the old days there used to be a conservative magazines by William F Buckley Center you might not agree but they didn't just wholesale makeup stuff like a National Review for instance I don't agree with a lot of things that are reported in national or the perception or the stance that's taken on stories in National Review but at least it comes from a genuine place you know what I'm saying at this and least were having a debate an ideological debate rather than what we're seeing now with someone like Infowars for instance Breitbart the conspiracy theorists that just smear people that they disagree with and then you're not even having a conversation that's based in fact anymore or a debate that's based in fact anymore so like the Weekly Standard is in neocon rag I can't stand it okay and it helped to drive us in the Iraq war terrible terrible consequence from that and it does propaganda but like we've now gotten to a place where that seems normal because at least they didn't say oh we got to go get Iraq because the lizard people are in Iraq and and Saddam Hussein is 80% gorillas eighty percent pig and and sent in actors to do XYZ they just did normal propaganda about how there was weapons of mass destruction and Saddam had done 9/11 those things weren't true either and it had worse consequences I fully fully understand that but they were twist facts they would given interpretation they would say oh they went to me in Czechoslovakia and making giant bed of it one day or the Czech Republic or whatever it was at the time but but at least they were grounded on planet Earth they were trying to manipulate facts on planet Earth these guys have lost their goddamn minds and they're driving their readership their viewers and even Republican officials to absolute lunacy and they've been encouraged to come out of the lunatic closet and so here we are with some portion of a country that's emboldened to say insane thing one to attack victims again victims who experience their own friends and teachers get shot and killed in front of their very eyes they they think that it's a good idea to attack them in smear it's just so devastating there's more by the way that I really want to get to so Snopes had to debunk some of these conspiracy theories they looked into claims that David Hogg who's one of these students who's been smeared is not really a parkland student as claimed by a website that posted a page from a purported classmates.com yearbook from Redondo Shores High School in California claiming to show Hogg as a student in Los Angeles and a quote from a classmate who said he always wanted to work for CNN and be an actor it was all photoshopped it was all photos of course yes a former student at parklands Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school notes that the redondo page is actually from a Douglass yearbook which explains why many in the photo are wearing a Douglass shirt so you see this off on Twitter and Facebook all the time you know whether it comes from bad actors in the US or some other country I don't know but you see it all the time you see photoshopped imagery all the time you know you see the smear attacks to discredit people who have genuine concerns and want to you know basically pressure our politicians to finally represent us and protect us that's what we're seeing right now and it's so sad that these students have to deal with smears following such a traumatic and devastating moment in their lives you one last thing about this look I used to read conservative articles I unless they're from a legit publication I don't read them anymore because if there's a conservative website I don't know what's true what's not true so it's actually even hurting conservative causes because some percentage of rational human beings have realized you cannot trust a word that comes out of a conservative website you have no idea what's Photoshop what's not Photoshop what's a conspiracy theory what's not I mean some are obvious and brazen and ridiculous but almost every like every other thing they print is a lie so okay I guess you're gonna trick some of the people some of the time and you've got your short-term win in Donald Trump and you must be ecstatic and you guys are the ones who do the fake news in the first place then you turn around and blame everybody else for it I get it but in the long term any rational should never read a conservative website and think that it has any credibility or shred of truth in it at all their job they don't view lying as the bug they view it as the feature so by the way if you're a real conservative why don't you start a publication or something where you actually give an actual point of view with an ideology from defend conservative ideas without making up lunatic conspiracy theories and blaming poor people who just saw people get shot right in front of their eyes you just watch the video by the young turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
