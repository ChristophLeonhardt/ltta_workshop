00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking a lot to say about choices</font>

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,870
choices and adulthood and if you've

6
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,010
watched this channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a little while</font>

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,849
you know that i love fluidity<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am</font>

8
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,289
generally opposed to rigidity but i'm

9
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,720
open to arguments and I I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my</font>

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,250
20s I even know if I would catch guys it

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,260
as my 20s maybe it's my 20s maybe it's

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,880
my life off my dad passed away maybe

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,429
it's my life and a steady job maybe it's

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,439
my life as a highly privileged<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,050
maybe it's maybe it's maybe is but in

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,450
this situation where I am I feel like I

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,890
am 70 so aware of the choices I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,050
of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things as lots of nettle</font>

19
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,360
choices rather than lots of extreme

ideological choices<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,570
think you're not about this in terms of

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,829
when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning about climate change</font>

26
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,480
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> global warming when I was younger</font>

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,460
and not because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying that I</font>

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,250
was naive necessarily I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's fair i think it's quite mean even</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who fly all the time are</font>

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,700
really selfish and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that they're</font>

probably really bad people<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> realizing</font>

tier status on my flying membership card

thing with my preferred a<font color="#E5E5E5"> line of choice</font>

39
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,600
because I fly so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't love that</font>

40
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,490
choice there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices in my life</font>

41
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,930
that I don't love and there are many

<font color="#E5E5E5">things that I want to change and will</font>

43

try to change and and working on but I'm

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,850
working on it and progress making

45
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,630
progress is about change it's not about

46
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,680
flicking a switch from one to the other

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,049
it's about all of us making conscious

48
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,920
decisions and progressing forward even

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the word progress it sounds positive but</font>

50
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,680
it also sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> in motion you've never</font>

51
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,719
reached there you know you're never

52
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,280
there there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always more to do and</font>

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,570
there is always a lot that you're not

54
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,430
seeing and that you don't know and

55
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,409
people's voices that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you aren't hearing</font>

56
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,389
and situations that you aren't seeing

57
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,210
and

58
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,640
you don't understand and that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me has</font>

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,610
very much combined with the state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

60
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,560
mind I'm in right now for a very long

61
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,510
time as an extremely judgmental person

62
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,760
I'm far less so now but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,040
still quite judgmental person on some

64
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,140
level in part because I judge myself on

65
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,520
so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm very hard on</font>

66
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,410
myself in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it it</font>

shoes that you know to kill a

69
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,170
mockingbird say many situations like as

70
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,810
when i was a child i see someone whether

71
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,850
it's an actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> person i know or</font>

72
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,560
hypothetical i see them doing something

73
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,780
in they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

74
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,000
would never ever make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the decision like</font>

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,130
what are they thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognizing those</font>

76
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,170
moments has allowed that to fall away a

77
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,000
lot and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has allowed that to you i</font>

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,910
dunno does not be my outlook because i

79
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,980
have no idea i've realized even from the

80
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,810
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I gave before of the climate</font>

for certain that I wouldn't I don't know

for certain that I would do whatever it

<font color="#E5E5E5">is I'm condemning another person for</font>

Houses throwing stones etc moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,240
being someone who sinks in the extreme

00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,400
in many<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways society can bring you up to</font>

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,140
thinking extremes whether that's in

90
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,900
school or in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> treatment of one</font>

91
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,240
another or in religion language in

extremes language functioning extreme a

93
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,070
huge part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me in getting to know</font>

94
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,340
myself and getting more of a sense of my

95
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,890
capabilities and my strengths as a

96
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,490
person and what I want from my life as

97
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,340
well has been in recognizing that

98
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,580
judgment can be very poisonous sometimes

99
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,620
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's more often than not the</font>

100
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,180
actions that we are so quick to condemn

101
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,430
I just made<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> loads of tiny little</font>

102
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">choices and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

103
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,440
are no such thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as choices that we</font>

104
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,330
should condemn on a scale for example

105
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,030
there are many many examples in world

106
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,770
history of choices people have made

107
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,140
worthy of condemnation if we treat those

108
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,960
choices as an easy extreme as an easy

109
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,900
decision that someone made to be evil or

110
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,660
behave in an evil way or that anything

111
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,750
about grasping power and wanting power

112
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,140
isn't itself simple then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're</font>

113
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,270
not going to make any progress we're not

going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make any progress</font>

115
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,410
in any direction because because we're

<font color="#CCCCCC">not opening ourselves up to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>
