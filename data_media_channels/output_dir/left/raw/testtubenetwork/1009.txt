Bulgaria, 2015

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:21,810
In the last two years, more than 18,000 refugees
have entered Bulgaria.

3
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,270
Most are fleeing the Syrian civil war.

4
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:32,270
To keep people out, Bulgaria is constructing
a 100 Â­mile fence along the Turkish border.

5
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:05,949
It is hoped the fence will improve the economic
strain put on the country from the influx

6
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,110
in

7
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,110
immigrants.

8
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,120
It is hoped the fence will improve the economic
strain on the country, due in part from the

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,120
influx

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,120
in immigrants.

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:00:00,000
But the UN has urged Bulgaria to keep its
border open to asylum seekers.
