1
00:00:01,278 --> 00:00:02,979
THIS IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE,

2
00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:04,081
PARTICULARLY WITH CHINA.

3
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:05,015
>> Dana: JOHN, THANK YOU FOR

4
00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:05,415
THE ROBERT.

5
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:05,949
WE APPRECIATE IT.

6
00:00:05,949 --> 00:00:07,384
THE NORTH KOREANS INVITING A

7
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:08,385
SMALL GROUP OF FOREIGN

8
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:10,354
JOURNALISTS TO WITNESS A

9
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:11,488
DESTRUCTION OF THE PRIMARY

10
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:12,489
NUCLEAR TEST SITE.

11
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:14,424
MILITARY ANALYSTS LIKE GENERAL

12
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:17,094
JACK KEANE REMAIN SKEPTICAL.

13
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:19,696
>> GIVEN A WIDELY HELD VIEW

14
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:21,598
THAT THIS NUCLEAR TEST SITE

15
00:00:21,598 --> 00:00:24,401
COLLAPSED AS A RESULT OF THE

16
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:28,439
THEY CONDUCTED BACK IN

17
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,040
DECEMBER, THAT IT IS PROBABLY

18
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,941
A P.R. STUNT.

19
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:32,676
THEREFORE, THE SITE IS NOT

20
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:33,811
USABLE ANYWAY AND THEY ARE

21
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:37,148
TRYING TO ADVERTISE IT THAT

22
00:00:37,148 --> 00:00:39,917
THEY ARE DISMANTING THE

23
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:41,052
NUCLEAR -- DISMANTLING THE

24
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:42,486
NUCLEAR TEST SITE TO

25
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:43,988
DEMONSTRATE THEY’RE SERIOUS

26
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:44,822
ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION.

27
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:46,090
>> Dana: DENNIS WILDER IS

28
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,758
PROFESSOR OF ASIAN STUDIES AT

29
00:00:47,758 --> 00:00:49,327
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY AND THE

30
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:51,028
FORMER DIRECTOR OF EAST ASIAN

31
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:51,863
AFFAIRS AT THE NATIONAL

32
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:52,630
SECURITY COUNCIL.

33
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,698
I AM GLAD YOU ARE HERE TODAY.

34
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:54,999
YOU ARE THE PERFECT GUEST ON

35
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:56,167
THE PERFECT DAY TO TALK ABOUT

36
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:56,534
IT.

37
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:58,403
YOU KNOW EACH OF THE COUNTRIES

38
00:00:58,403 --> 00:00:59,537
INDIVIDUALLY BUT YOU LOOK AT

39
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:01,639
THE REGION OF A WHOLE AND YOU

40
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:02,673
KNOW THE UNITED STATES

41
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:03,040
POSITION.

42
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,441
SO LET ME GIVE YOU THE FLOOR

43
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:05,743
TO GIVE ME YOUR IMPRESSIONS

44
00:01:05,743 --> 00:01:07,045
AFTER THE PRESIDENT’S MEETING

45
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:08,012
TODAY WITH THE PRESIDENT OF

46
00:01:08,012 --> 00:01:12,016
SOUTH KOREA IN THE OVAL

47
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:12,450
OFFICE.

48
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,285
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS

49
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:16,654
MAKING SOME VERY SMART MOVES

50
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:20,759
HERE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE

51
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:21,126
SUMMIT.

52
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:24,062
THE NORTH KOREANS CLEARLY ARE

53
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:25,764
FEELING THEIR OATS A BIT AND

54
00:01:25,764 --> 00:01:27,499
THEY ARE GOING BACK TO THE OLD

55
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:27,832
STYLE.

56
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:32,704
IN PART, THE PRESIDENT IS

57
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:35,407
RIGHT.

58
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:37,042
BECAUSE XI JINPING HAS STARTED

59
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:38,009
TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC

60
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,111
DEVELOPMENT WITH THE NORTH AND

61
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:40,846
THE NORTH IS FEELING LIKE THEY

62
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:41,913
HAVE THEIR BACK COVERED BY THE

63
00:01:41,913 --> 00:01:42,247
CHINESE.

64
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:44,049
SO NOW THE PRESIDENT WATCHING

65
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:45,684
THAT IS REALIZING THAT HE HAS

66
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:47,452
TO PUT THE PRESSURE BACK ON

67
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:49,388
THE CHINESE AND ON THE NORTH

68
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:49,755
KOREANS.

69
00:01:49,755 --> 00:01:51,390
SO WHAT HE IS SAYING IS WHAT

70
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,925
WE SHOULD BE SAYING, WHICH IS

71
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:55,294
HEY, WE WILL HAVE THIS MEETING

72
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:59,098
IF THE TERMS ARE RIGHT.

73
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:01,667
IF THE TERMS AREN’T RIGHT, WE

74
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:02,134
CAN WAIT.

75
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:03,435
ONE THING IN THE PAST WE HAVE

76
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:04,803
SEEN IS THE AMERICAN

77
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:06,538
NEGOTIATORS WITH THE NORTH

78
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:07,406
KOREANS TOO EAGER TO FIND A

79
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:08,473
WAY TO GET A DEAL.

80
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:09,808
WHEN WE DO THAT, THEY TAKE US

81
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:12,311
FOR A RIDE AND THEY HAVE TAKEN

82
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:13,579
US FOR SEVERAL RIDES IN THE

83
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:13,913
PAST.

84
00:02:13,913 --> 00:02:15,614
I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS

85
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:16,482
SIGNALS -- GO AHEAD.

86
00:02:16,482 --> 00:02:18,017
>> Dana: I WANT TO ASK YOU

87
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:19,318
ABOUT THE SOUTH KOREANS.

88
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:20,586
BECAUSE IN THIS SCENARIO IT

89
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:22,855
SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE VERY EAGER

90
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:23,889
AND TODAY IN THE "WASHINGTON

91
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:27,126
POST" THERE WAS AN OP-ED BY

92
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:30,263
THE SACKEN AMBASSADOR -- SOUTH

93
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:31,230
KOREAN AMBASSADOR OF THE

94
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,998
UNITED STATES.

95
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:33,666
"WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE HOPE

96
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,902
THAT KIM MAY CHOOSE A

97
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:37,737
OR HIS GRANDFATHER, UNLIKE IN

98
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:38,137
THE PAST.

99
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:39,806
WE HAVE SEEN AND ARE ABOUT TO

100
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:41,407
SEE DIPLOMATIC ACTIONS ON THE

101
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:43,509
HIGHEST LEVEL AMONG THE MAIN

102
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:44,444
COUNTRIES INVOLVED."

103
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:45,812
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE

104
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:47,313
DYNAMIC OF WHAT THE SOUTH

105
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:48,448
KOREANS WANT AND WHAT THE

106
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,315
CHINESE WANT AND THE PRESIDENT

107
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:50,917
SAYING LOOK, I’M NOT COMING

108
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,518
OVER THERE, I’M NOT GOING TO

109
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:57,424
WASTE MY TIME AND FLY TO

110
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,158
SINGAPORE FOR NOTHING.

111
00:02:58,158 --> 00:02:59,392
BUT THE SOUTH KOREANS ARE KEEN

112
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:00,593
TO GET THIS DONE.

113
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:01,661
>> I WAS ACTUALLY GLAD THAT

114
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,564
THE NORTH KOREANS IF YOU WILL

115
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:05,598
POPPED THE BUBBLE OF THE SOUTH

116
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:07,033
KOREANS A LITTLE BIT BY

117
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:09,102
REFUSING TO HAVE THE MEETINGS

118
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:11,238
AND BY REFUSING TO HAVE THE

119
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:12,539
SOUTH KOREAN REPORTER GOES TO

120
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:13,340
THE TEST SITE.

121
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,307
I THINK SOUTH KOREA WAS

122
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,276
GETTING WAY OUT ON ITS SKIS ON

123
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:17,711
THIS.

124
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,246
AND WAY TOO BELIEVING THAT

125
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:20,414
THERE IS A CHANGE IN NORTH

126
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:21,214
KOREA.

127
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:23,817
I DO THINK KIM 3.0 IS

128
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:26,586
DIFFERENT THAN THE KIM 2.0 AND

129
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:26,954
1.0.

130
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:30,023
HE DID STUDY IN SWITZERLAND.

131
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:33,360
HE IS INTERNET SAVVY.

132
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,528
I THINK HE IS THINKING IF HE

133
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,662
GOT THE RIGHT DEAL FOR HIS

134
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:36,597
PEOPLE THERE IS THE

135
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:37,831
POSSIBILITY THAT HE WOULD GIVE

136
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:39,199
UP THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

137
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,602
I’M NOT AS CONVINCED AS SOME

138
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:42,770
PEOPLE HE WOULD NEVER GIVE

139
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,370
THEM UP.

140
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,972
>> Dana: BUT IT IS DIFFERENT

141
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:46,206
FOR HIM IN THAT HE HAS THE

142
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:47,508
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

143
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:49,944
THE TWO PREVIOUS KIMS DID NOT.

144
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:50,611
>> RIGHT.

145
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:52,279
>> Dana: LET ME ASK ABOUT

146
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,247
ONE OTHER THING, CHINA.

147
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:54,181
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT

148
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:55,149
THAT BEFORE I LET YOU GO.

149
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:56,817
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO THIS

150
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,719
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT WAS

151
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,954
OBVIOUSLY AS JOHN ROBERTS

152
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:01,555
REPORTED NOT THAT HAPPY WITH

153
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:03,491
HOW CHINA MAY HAVE WEIGHED IN

154
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:03,791
HERE.

155
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,392
LISTEN.

156
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:05,493
>> President Trump: NO, NOT

157
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:06,327
REALLY.

158
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:11,332
I THINK THAT THEY’RE A START.

159
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:12,700
BUT WE NEED SOMETHING.

160
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,434
LOOK.

161
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:15,103
CHINA HAS BEEN -- I REALLY

162
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:17,404
CALL IT A "DERELICTION OF

163
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:21,576
DUTIES" TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

164
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:22,777
US ON TRADE THE WAY WE HAVE

165
00:04:22,777 --> 00:04:24,112
BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

166
00:04:24,112 --> 00:04:26,147
CHINA HAS AN EXAMPLE HAS MADE

167
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,315
A FORTUNE.

168
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:29,450
I MEAN A TRANSFER OF WEALTH

169
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,186
LIKE NOBODY HAS SEEN IN

170
00:04:31,186 --> 00:04:31,553
HISTORY.

171
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:33,721
THEY ARE THE BIG ONE.

172
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:35,857
THEY ARE ALMOST ALL BAD BUT

173
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:36,825
CHINA IS THE BIG ONE.

174
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:38,493
I’M NOT SATISFIED BUT WE WILL

175
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:39,427
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

176
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:40,395
>> Dana: TELL ME WHAT YOU

177
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:44,199
THINK ABOUT THAT, DENNIS.

178
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,167
>> THESE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS

179
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:46,635
ARE TOUGH.

180
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:48,703
IT’S BETWEEN THE WORLD TWO

181
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:51,573
LARGEST MASSIVE ECONOMIES.

182
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:52,908
NOW THE CHINESE I THINK ARE

183
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:54,342
COMING IN TRYING TO LOW BALL

184
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:55,010
THE UNITED STATES.

185
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,279
I THINK THE PRESIDENT’S RIGHT

186
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,681
TO SAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO

187
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:00,982
TAKE CRUMBS OFF THE TABLE

188
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:01,350
AGAIN.

189
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,518
YOU HAVE DONE WELL OFF THE

190
00:05:03,518 --> 00:05:03,885
MARKETS.

191
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:06,888
YOU DO WELL EVERY YEAR OFF THE

192
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:07,256
