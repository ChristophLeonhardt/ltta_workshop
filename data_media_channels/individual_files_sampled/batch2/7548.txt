MUSICAL ARTIST LORDE IS BEING CALLED A BIGOT IN A FULL-PAGE AD THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE WASHINGTON POST. WHO TOOK OUT THE AD? RABBI SCHOOLEY, A HUGE PUBLIC FIGURE, AND ORTHODOX JEWISH INDIVIDUAL WHO IS VERY PRO-ISRAEL AND AGAINST ANYONE SUPPOSEDLY WHO WOULD EVER DARE TO BOYCOTT ISRAEL'S RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT. I JUST WANT TO SAY MY POINT OF VIEW. ONE, THE RABBI IS NOT PRO-ISRAEL, I AM NOT SAYING HE IS ANTI-ISRAEL, HE IS JUST PRO-ISRAELI RIGHT-WING. IT IS LIKE SAYING BEING FAVOR OF DICK CHENEY IS BEING PRO-AMERICAN. THERE IS A RIGHT WING AND A LEFT WING IN AMERICA, SAME IN ISRAEL. HE IS PRO-RIGHT-WING. EVEN IF IT GOES AGAINST ISRAEL. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AND SECONDLY, THE RABBI HAS BEEN A LONG AROUND A LONG TIME. I KNOW HIM A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW HE GAVE LOVE ADVICE ON OPRAH'S SHOW? HE IS A CHARACTER. SHALOM IN THE HOME. I GOT IT. BUT WITHOUT THE BACKING OF BILLIONAIRE BENEFACTORS HE WOULD BE NOTHING. HE DOESN'T HAVE A LARGE AUDIENCE AT ALL. YOU THINK HE HAS THE MONEY TO BUY A FULL-PAGE WASHINGTON POST AD? NO. IT IS OTHER PEOPLE BEHIND-THE-SCENES. LORDE, YOUNG POPSTAR. SHE WAS SET TO PERFORM IN TEL AVIV IN JUNE BUT THERE WAS A BIT OF CONTROVERSY BECAUSE THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN BOYCOTTING ISRAEL OVER ITS TREATMENT OF PALESTINIANS URGED HER TO NOT PERFORM THERE. AND SHE EVENTUALLY DECIDED TO FOLLOW SUIT AND SHE CANCELED HER APPEARANCE IN TEL AVIV. SHE SAID THE FOLLOWING IN REGARDS TO HER DECISION. NOTHING PARTICULARLY RUDE OR MEAN, NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ANTI-SEMITIC IN THAT STATEMENT WHATSOEVER. BUT RABBI SCHOOLEY DECIDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PUT OUT THE SIDE AND ALLEGE THAT SHE IS ANTI-SEMITIC FOR CANCELING HER SHOW AND THAT NEW ZEALAND AS A WHOLE IS ANTI-SOMATIC. NEW ZEALAND IS WHERE SHE IS FROM. THE HEADLINE OF THIS AD SAID THIS. WHO SAID THEY WERE IGNORING SYRIA? SHE MOVED HER CONCERT FROM TEL AVIV TO DAMASCUS? NO. ISSUE DOING A CONCERT IN SYRIA? NO. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HER OPINION ON SYRIA IS? NO. IT IS A FORM OF DISTRACTION TO SAY ISRAEL MIGHT BE OCCUPYING PEOPLE, BUT SQUIRREL OR IN THIS CASE SYRIA. I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THIS ALLEGATION THAT NEW ZEALAND IS ANTI-SOMATIC. I WANTED TO KNOW WHY AND IT TURNS OUT NEW ZEALAND HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THE COUNTRIES THAT VOTED ALONG OTHER COUNTRIES AGAINST OR IN FAVOR OF A UN RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE US TO WITHDRAW ITS DECISION TO RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. ALSO IN 2016 NEW ZEALAND VOTED ALONG WITH OTHER UN COUNTRIES TO CALLOUT ISRAEL FOR BUILDING ILLEGAL SETTLEMENTS. THAT IS THE REASON WHY NEW ZEALAND IS CONSIDERED ANTI-SEMITIC IN THE RABBI'S EYES. ONE POINT, CAN A WHOLE COUNTRY BE ANTI-SEMITIC? THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE PREPOSTEROUS. LET ALONE NEW ZEALAND. SECOND OF ALL, 127 COUNTRIES VOTED FOR THAT RESOLUTION. BUT FOR THE RABBI AND HIS BACKERS THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, SMEAR THE WHOLE WORLD. THE WORLD HAS A HISTORY OF ANTI-SEMITISM THAT RUNS SUPER DEEP. BUT TO THEN USE THAT AS AN EXCUSE AND A SHIELD WHEN ALL THESE COUNTRIES ARE LEGITIMATELY WORRIED THAT YOU ARE BREAKING INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ARE PRESSING OTHER PEOPLE, YOU ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE CAUSE OF ALLEVIATING ANTI-SEMITISM DAMAGE BECAUSE YOU ARE CRYING WOLF AND ARE SAYING THE WHOLE WORLD IS ANTI-SEMETIC. LORDE IS NOT RANDOM, SHE IS AWESOME. BUT IT REALLY DOES MINIMIZE REAL ANTI-SEMITISM WHICH IS ALIVE AND WELL TODAY. BUT IF YOU DECIDE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR SHOW IN TEL AVIV BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE WAY THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IS HANDLING THINGS WITH THE PALESTINIANS, THAT IS YOUR RIGHT. YOU SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO GO PERFORM SOMEWHERE OR YOU WILL BE DEEMED AN ANTI-SEMITE IN A FULL-PAGE AD. THAT IS LUDICROUS. SO WHO ARE HIS BACKERS? IT TURNS OUT THE RABBI'S ORGANIZATIONS ARE FUNDED BY SHELDON ADELSTEIN. WHO DO WE KNOW IS CONSIDERABLY QUESTIONABLE TOWARD THE JEWISH COMMUNITY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES? THE ALT RIGHT. STEVE BANNON HAS BEEN ON THE RECORD SAYING THAT BREITBART IS THE PLACE WHERE THE ALT RIGHT HAVE A VOICE. THE RABBI SHOULD DISLIKE STEVE BANNON, BUT HE DOESN'T. HE DEFENDED BANNON WHEN HE WAS CALLED UP BY THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE. WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUAL ANTI-SOMATIC BEHAVIOR HE IS ALL FOR IT BECAUSE HIS FUNDERS ARE ALL FOR IT. WHEN IT COMES TO SOMEONE LIKE LORDE, SHE IS ANTI-SEMITE. BANNON IN HIS DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS, HIS WIFE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT THE KIDS TO ATTEND A JEWISH SCHOOL BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT THEM BEING AROUND JEWS. A DIVORCE PROCEEDING, THOSE THINGS GET UGLY, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. BUT MILO ñ BUZZY DID A TERRIFIC ANALYSIS OF THIS ñ MILO WHEN HE WAS DOING THE COMPILATION OF WHAT THE ALT RIGHT STANDS FOR FOR BREITBART CONFERRED WITH NEO-NAZIS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ALT RIGHT POSITIONS WERE AND THEN PUT THEM INTO THAT TREATISE FOR WHAT THE ALT RIGHT STANDS FOR. THE TREATISE THAT STEVE BANNON'S WEBSITE PROMOTED WAS WRITTEN PARTLY BY NEO-NAZIS. BUT WHAT DOES ADELSON WANT? HE WANTS THE RIGHT-WING POSITION IN ISRAEL, HE WANTS THE UNIONS CRUSHED, HE WANTS DEREGULATION, LOWER TAXES. IF TRUMP AND BANNON ARE MONSTERS AND POTENTIALLY ANTI-SEMITES, TRUMP WENT TO A GATHERING OF REPUBLICAN JEWISH LEADERS AND SAID IF ANYONE IN THE ROOM KNOWS HOW TO RENEGOTIATE IT IS THIS ONE. IF ANYONE IN NEW ZEALAND WOULD'VE SAID THAT THE RABBI WOULD'VE TAKEN OUT SEVEN-PAGE ADS IN THE WASHINGTON POST. BUT THEY BACK ALL THOSE GUYS ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THE JEWS ARE PROTECTED. THEY ARE INTERESTED IN USING ANTI-SEMITISM AS A CLUB TO BE OVER THE HEADS OF PEOPLE WITH IT. AND THEY WANT TO INTIMIDATE ANYONE ELSE WHO MIGHT SAY YOU SHOULD JOIN THE BOYCOTT MOVEMENT. OR YOU SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT DOING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN ISRAEL AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE THE ILLEGAL OCCUPATION OF THE PALESTINIANS. THESE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH ISRAEL. THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PALESTINIANS ALSO HAVE RIGHTS.
