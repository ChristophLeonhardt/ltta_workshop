it's been a busy few weeks for thieves criminals and murderers in our capital city and here are just a few recent stories from Sadiq Khan's London new data released by the Metropolitan Police has shown that crime has gone up by 6.4 percent over the year ending May 28th teen and the data also shows that law breaking has increased in every single borough in London every single one and specifically it's interesting because the biggest rise over the last 12 months in crime was in a rich area Richmond upon Thames so who would have thought it criminals and gangs are going after rich people but the whole city is really suffering at this point we know it's getting really bad this reports of murders attacks robberies basically every single day the media has some kind of attack that's happened in London on the front pages or in on the online news sites every single day and if you're out of the loop I thought I'd bring you a few stories that have happened literally over the last week or so all of these stories by the way this isn't a complete list this is just a summary of some of the worst things that have happened over the last maybe ten days the independent reports that one man was knifed in the chest in an unprovoked attack in Croydon South London police is still looking for that knife man who stabbed a random 26 year old man another story just a few days ago a judge lifted an anonymity order on a 17 year old who stabbed another teenager in an attempt to basically crack down on the epidemic of knife crimes in London the teenager stabbed a 14 year old a 14 year old who almost bled to death during the attack which also happened in Croydon today the BBC reported that the home officers doubled its youth crime prevention program to spend twenty two million pounds so let's hope they do more than send in local cheesy drama groups to do plays at schools and on the 27th of July residents of forest gate in East London saw a shootout between police and a gang of masked men and yesterday the four men who were involved with that shootout were charged with attempted murder after firing shots at officers yep that really happened and on July 20th a young 24 year old mother was killed and left to die in the street a 28 year old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder on the 27th of July the independent reported that a teenager was stabbed and then thrown from a moped in Camberwell into the street and he died on the 23rd of July a man was left in critical condition after a daylight stabbing in Eltham and last week a Sky News investigation released after months of dealing with him working with some of the worst gangs in London black on black violence it found is out of control with almost half of murder victims and murder suspects in the capital city being young black men but don't worry guys city cons got this right he's just going to keep blaming it on the Tories and the Tory cuts I mean Boris Johnson the former mayor of London has said that he basically left Sadiq Khan with a war chest full of money so I'm wondering where that's gone maybe on some more diversity projects and hate crime officers now some people are claiming that when Sadiq Khan says that middle-class cocaine use is fueling this crime that he's crazy he's crazy right and I want to be honest him I don't want to be a hack so Sadiq Khan has said that the use of cocaine and people purchasing drugs middle-class people purchasing drugs is basically assisting in the the rising gang violence and I'm gonna be honest here and say actually it's true it's not the core issue here it's not the key reason why people are doing this but if people weren't going out buying drugs then what would the gangs be stabbing themselves over there to be fair they'd probably go back to the whole postcode thing but it's obviously true that this has some effect but it's Sadiq Khan overall dealing with this I don't think so this is not the primary problem drug use is not the primarily problem I'd like to stop it I think people should stop buying drugs stop buying illegal drugs and fueling these gangs and aiding your health by the way stop doing drugs people but it's not the primary problem here if we if we started looking at social cohesion if we look to integration the housing crisis and real poverty as well as forced multiculturalism ghettos and division and the lack of a unifying British culture if we examined those things and made real policy proposals and made real policy action if we started making these things real if we started implementing sensible policies on unifying culture then and only then would we see a difference in the crime rates in if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
