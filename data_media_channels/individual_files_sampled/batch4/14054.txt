the lowest by-election campaign is in full swing and I've caught the Liberal Democrats telling lies there's gonna be a by-election on June the 14th in Lewisham East and that's there to replace Heidi Alexander the former Labour MP who's gone off to work with City Carl in City Hall and there's 14 candidates the Liberal Democrats have Lucy salic and I've caught them telling some lies now it's not the first time they've ever done this so I want to walk through some examples of this but in the meantime let's look at this tweet here I caught the Sun today delivering a few hundred of these for Lucy say look and they looked at the leaf work and I thought that looks like a magazine lewisham living is called briggsie crime education does that not look like a magazine now let's look on the front now imprint no logo now I'm sure there's an imprint somewhere on there but let's just looking at the front of this no logo no mention of the Liberal Democrats nothing what it does say at the bottom is exclusive interview Lucy salic the woman tipped to be our next MP okay tip to be the next MP by who by who Liberal Democrats I would like to know the answer to this know bookmakers no politician no major journalists in fact probably no journalist I've not seen a single one of them has predicted that the Liberal Democrats will win this seat or can win this seat so when they publish material that's deliberately misleading it's it's a magazine that's not a campaign leaflet that is a magazine and when they tip they say a woman tip to be our next MP what are they doing they're trying to tell the voters oh well this woman's going to be our MP so it makes people feel more confident in going out voting for the Liberal Democrats okay it's a tactic I get it but that is wrong and also it's not just rock it's a lie the woman took to be on extra MP by who who said this there's no clear indication it's an actual material and I want to know is this allowed is this allowed then the electoral commission rules now I've had a look at the rules and of course you have to have an election imprint on there but it does say in the rules as well that if you have a party logo that is recognizable enough that could replace the imprint then it's fine just use the logo I've got no idea there's no logo on the front there's nothing so that really bugged me but here's another one let's have a look at this Twitter Lois um Lib Dems an action-packed weekend for Lewisham Lib Dems and Lucy salic in Lewisham East thank you to all on amazing volunteers yada yada yada now on this one it says and again this is another leaflet that looks like a newspaper notice a theme here it says at the top it's Lib Dems or labor in Lewisham see page three look free Lewisham news again not a single logo on this thing and this one isn't so much about lying there lie is at the top when they say the woman's hip to be the next MP she's not the this one it's just a bit of a push they say it's Liberal Democrats or labour now you've got to be really sort of generous with the statistics here to say that that's the case the last time the Lib Dems came second was eight years ago that was three elections ago in 2010 they came second but they only marginally beat the Tories by a couple of thousand votes and there was still six thousand votes behind labour but in the last two elections they've come fourth and third with just over two thousand votes each so when they release this material which has no identifiable Liberal Democrat logo on the front and let's be honest most people get this through in the post will probably read the front Newt the front page and bin it so all they're gonna see is a local newspaper reporting that it slid downs or labor in Lewisham and they might well believe that and the reason they're doing this we know either doing this is because it makes people feel more confident when they've wrote a Lib Dems and the fact that around 60 65 percent roughly that voted remain in Lewisham East they want people to go out and vote Lib Dem because Lib Dem is the only party that is fervently saying yes we want a second referendum or we just don't want bread they're over parties kind of iffy on it although the Labour candidate Janet Dobby wants us to stay in the customs union and the single market so again when they say this is Liberal Democrats or labour come on it's it's a push it's a push and it's it's misleading but then there's also other stuff here like you've probably seen the Liberal Democrats signs that people put outside their houses you know the the diamond-shaped ones again on this same tweet Lucy say like Liberal Democrats winning here Liberal Democrats winning here in Lewisham East really Liberal Democrats winning here and more misleading information more misleading claims this seat has been around for a hundred years now it appears to have been created the constituency in 1918 and in that hundred years the Liberal Democrats have never even won one the Liberal Democrats all the Liberals have never won a single seat they've never won it once in Lewisham East and yet they they just brazenly have these signs saying Liberal Democrats when he here not true okay well what about the council's jack okay let's look at the council results every single councillor in Lewisham Beasties labor for the last 26 years they've had a Labour MP when of the Liberal Democrats won here how are they winning here this is misleading information and it's not the this isn't the first time little Liberal Democrats have done this they've counted on this kind of election material for years long history let's look at this leaflet from Islington south again it's Islington and Finsbury News actually this is another example here look at the front of this leaflet no Lib Dem logo and then they've got this laughable bar chart at the top where labour 12345 Lib Dem eleven thousand eight hundred and sixty one and then conservatives which have got just under half roughly of what live dam have and the conservative bar on this bar chart is like what ten percent of the size of the limp like it's it's funny but it's also worrying I mean they say can't win in Islington well who says who says it's down to the voters who wins just a 484 votes separating Bridget Fox and Gordon Brown's Labour MP no other result is possible it's it's amazing right look at another one for Islington North just I want it I want to prove my point here that this has been going on for years another one conservatives 3740 lib dems 9000 402 and again the conservative bar is tiny then let's look in Glasgow North another hilarious example right at the bottom this actually seems to be a letter from the candidate so but again no Lib Dem logo they really do seem ashamed of their logo I'm not surprised it's hideous isn't it look at this one it's a two horse race labour 39% Lib Dem 27% SP 13 conservative nine I mean have they ever gone to a basic maths class even though I remember this from my old maths class in high school about misleading bar charts and graphs I mean it's disgraceful I don't think they should get away with this if the Electoral Commission is there to protect the integrity of elections and campaigns then the Electoral Commission should be doing their job fix it I think the Electoral Commission should have a say about this the Electoral Commission should be doing something to stop this if their job is to remain but maintain the integrity of elections they should be doing something the Liberal Democrats sum up the reason why people hate politicians they show no interest in the causes that people care about they only care about getting votes getting their people back into their cushy jobs in Westminster and if that means lying on election materials by gosh they're gonna do it in Lewisham East the Liberal Democrats are purposely misleading voters they are the reason why people hate politicians and I think it's about time the Electoral Commission did something about it don't you if you like that and want to see more remember to like and subscribe and download the new rebel app from the Apple App Store and the
