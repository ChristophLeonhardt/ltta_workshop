EVERYBODY RESPECTS WHAT YOU DID

>> Martha: BELIEVE ME.

17
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,490
YOU BELONG AN ELITE CLUB OF

18
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:49,458
QUARTERBACKS WHO HAVE SUPER BOWL

19
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:51,427
RINGS AND IT EVEN SMALLER CLUB

20
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:53,362

SUPER BOWL.

22
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:54,630
YOU AND ELI MANNING.

23
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:55,931
MY QUESTION FOR YOU, WHEN YOU

24
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:58,701
WALKED IN THERE THAT NIGHT, DID

25
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:00,469
YOU SENSE THAT THAT TEAM WAS

26
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,871
VULNERABLE, THAT HE WAS

27
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:02,905
VULNERABLE, THAT YOU COULD BEAT

28
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:04,473
HIM AFTER THE HAND INJURY AND

29
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:05,474
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WEEK?

30
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:06,676
>> IT WAS MORE SO JUST FROM WHAT

31
00:01:06,677 --> 00:01:08,878
I KNEW WE HAD IN THE LOCKER ROOM

32
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:09,879
JUST WITH THE GUYS THROUGHOUT

33
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:15,818
GOING AGAINST THE PATRIOTS, IF

34
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:16,886
NOT THE GREATEST FRANCHISE OF

35
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:18,654
ALL TIME, THAT’S WE WANT TO GO

36
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:19,489
AGAINST.

37
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,656
TOM BRADY, BELICHICK, THAT’S WE

38
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:21,257
WANT TO FACE.

39
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:30,967
WE WERE READY TO PLAY.

40
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:31,668
>> Martha: AFTER SAY WHEN YOU

41
00:01:31,669 --> 00:01:33,269
GUYS WALKED OUT YOU COULD FEEL

42
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,670
THE ENERGY.

43
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:34,671
YOU COULD FEEL HOW PUMPED UP YOU

44
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:35,972
GUYS WERE AND I WAS WORRIED FROM

45
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,941
THE VERY FIRST SECONDS OF THE

46
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:38,241
GAME.

47
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:45,849
HE FAILED.

48
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,651
SHORTLY LATER YOU TRY TO DO THE

49
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:48,451
SAME THING AND YOU SUCCEEDED.

50
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:54,257
>> IT DOES APPEAR THAT WAY.

51
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:55,525
EAGLES FANS WILL PROBABLY USE

52
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:58,428
IT, BUT NO, HONESTLY WE HAD THE

53
00:01:58,429 --> 00:01:59,463
FILLING SPECIAL IN THE GAME PLAN

54
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:00,931
WEEKS PRIOR AND WE WERE GOING TO

55
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:01,998
USE IT IN THE SUPER BOWL I WAY

56
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,366
OR THE OTHER IN A JUST SO

57
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,836
HAPPENED THAT THEY TRIED A PLAY

58
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:07,671
A COUPLE PLAYS BEFORE WE DID AND

59
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:10,307
IF ANYTHING IT REMINDED ME MAKE

60
00:02:10,308 --> 00:02:11,608
SURE I LOOK AT ALL THE WAY IN

61
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:19,216
I DON’T THINK ANYBODY WILL EVER

62
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:19,650
FORGET.

63
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:20,517
MALCOLM BUTLER WAS NOT PUT IN

64
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:23,253
THE GAME BY COACHELLA CHECK AND

65
00:02:23,254 --> 00:02:24,288
A LOT OF PATRIOTS FANS BELIEVE

66
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:26,457
THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE REAL

67
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,125
VULNERABILITIES FOR THEM THAT

68
00:02:28,126 --> 00:02:28,425
NIGHT.

69
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,466
I NEVER REALLY WORRIED ABOUT

70
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:40,604
LINE.

71
00:02:40,605 --> 00:02:43,874
A GREAT SKILL SET SO I GUESS YOU

72
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:44,742
ARE A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED BUT

73
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:46,577
AT THE SAME TIME I’M NOT REALLY

74
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:51,949
IT RECOGNIZE THEIR COVERAGE AND

75
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,352
TRUST MY RECEIVERS TO BEAT THEM,

76
00:02:54,353 --> 00:02:55,887
BEAT THEM OFF THE BALL, BEAT

77
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:57,588
THEM IN THE ROWS AND I’VE GOT TO

78
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:58,322
EXPECT TO PUT THE BALL ON THE

79
00:02:58,323 --> 00:02:59,557
MONEY EVERY SINGLE TIME AND THAT

80
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:01,959
WAS MY MIND-SET IN THE GAME.

81
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,329
HE’S A TREMENDOUS PLAYER AND

82
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,230
WATCHING HIM ON FILM, HE WAS

83
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:07,932
GOING TO BE A GREAT MATCHUP.

84
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:11,502
>> Martha: YOU PLATE SO

85
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:12,270
RELAXED AND SO SMOOTH.

86
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:13,771
I WONDER -- YOU’VE HAD A LOT OF

87
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:15,306
ADVERSITY AS YOU POINT OUT IN

88
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:15,673
YOUR BOOK.

89
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,244
THE SUPER BOWL.

90
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:19,911
HOW DO YOU GET THERE?

91
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:22,380
YOU SAY THERE’S TWO NICK FOLES

92
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:24,282
AND YOU NEEDED TO SEPARATE THEM.

93
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:25,250
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

94
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:27,519
>> I THINK SOMETIMES WE GET AN

95
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:32,958
I THINK MY IDENTITY HAS AN

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,658
ATHLETE, YOU ARE TREATED BASED

97
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,895
ON HOW YOU PLAY SEE YOU HAVE A

98
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:38,230
GOOD GAME, SOMETIMES ARE TREATED

99
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:38,563
BETTER.

100
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:39,664
IF YOU HAVE A BAD NAME

101
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:41,633
EVERYONE’S AFRAID YOU AND I

102
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:43,101
THINK THAT EVENTUALLY WEARS ON

103
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:43,368
YOU.

104
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:44,870
YOU DON’T WANT TO BE TREATED AS

105
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:45,571
WHAT YOUR STATS SAY.

106
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:47,506
YOU WANT TO BE TREATED AS A

107
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:48,540
PERSON IN DEALING WITH THAT

108
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,775
THROUGHOUT MY CAREER AND FACING

109
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:52,611
THAT BATTLE, THAT’S BEEN ONGOIN

110
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:52,945
ONGOING.

111
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:54,279
I THINK I FINALLY CAME TO THE

112
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,348
CLIMAX IN ST. LOUIS WERE AFTER

113
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,283
THAT SEASON I NEED TO STEP BACK

114
00:03:58,284 --> 00:03:59,284
A LITTLE BIT AND ULTIMATELY I

115
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:09,595
BACK TO THE GAME BECAUSE IT SORT

116
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:10,429
OF ENTRAPPED ME.

117
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,698
I DIDN’T WANT TO TOUCH A

118
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,900
FOOTBALL AND A TEXAS BOY,

119
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:17,603
TOUCHING FOOTBALL THE FIRST DAY,

120
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:18,670
IT’S REALLY HARD.

121
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:19,572
YOU LOVE SOMETHING YOUR ENTIRE

122
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:21,206
LIFE AND ALL OF US ON THE YOU

123
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,575
LOSE IT BUT THE JOY CAME BACK.

124
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:25,945
I PRAYED ABOUT IT WITH MY WIFE

125
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:26,846
AND A LOT OF TEARS -- A PLAY FOR

126
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:31,484
OF THE GAME BACK.

127
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:32,285
>> Martha: YOU TALK A LOT

128
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:34,787
ABOUT GOD AND YOUR FAITH, HOW

129
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,589
DOES THAT SUSTAIN YOU?

130
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,291
>> I GAVE MY LIFE TO CHRIST AS A

131
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,192
FRESHMAN AT MICHIGAN STATE.

132
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:43,863
LIFE TO HIM UNTIL THAT YEAR.

133
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:48,968
MILES AWAY FROM HOME FROM TEXAS

134
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:50,603
AND IT WAS GOING THROUGH A LOT

135
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:52,272
WITH FOOTBALL ONCE AGAIN AND

136
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:58,545
WITH IT AND I WOULD SAY THAT

137
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:01,514
THROUGH THE TRIALS, THROUGH THE

138
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:03,283
UPS AND DOWNS, LEANING ON

139
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:04,451
CHRIST, NEVER FOR PROSPERITY.

140
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:05,418
I KNOW THAT WHAT I’M GOING

141
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:08,822
THROUGH TRIALS GOD IS TRYING TO

142
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:12,459
TEACH ME SOMETHING.

143
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,660
A BIG THING THROUGHOUT MY CAREER

144
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:19,466
WAS MY WIFE GETTING SICK WITH

145
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,138
CLOSER TOGETHER.

146
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:25,906
SHE’S RESILIENT, SHE’S AMAZING

147
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:27,207
AND NOW SHE’S GOT A PLATFORM TO

148
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:39,286
REALLY SPREAD AWARENESS.

149
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:39,953
>> Martha: BEAUTIFUL FAMILY.

150
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:40,688
NO DOUBT THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE

151
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:41,388
REALLY GIVES YOU PERSPECTIVE.

152
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:41,822
>> ABSOLUTELY.

153
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:42,489

HE NEEDS TO GET HEALTHY.

00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:49,163
HE’S GOING TO HAVE A GREAT

158
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:49,496

00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:13,888
QUARTERBACK ROOM.

173
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:14,889

00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,483
PICTURES, SHE PULLED SOME CABLES

189
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:57,918
OUT AND TRY TO TRICK HIM.

190
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,923
>> YOU HAVE TO BE AN ATHLETE,

191
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:03,390
EVEN ONSET.

192
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:03,957
[LAUGHTER]

193
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:04,758
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

194
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:10,631
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.

195
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:14,735
>> YOU ARE AWFUL, BUT IT’S SO

196
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:16,570
CHEAP.

197
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:17,638
>> I JUST ASKED ONE QUESTION.

198
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,641
>> THAT’S A TRUE PHILLIES FAN

199
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:25,479
NOT WITH JESSE ON THE AWNING,

200
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,115
YOU BROKE THE AWNING.

201
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:30,317
>> YES AND THE POLE.

202
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:32,319
>> HOW DID YOU GET UP THERE?

203
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,754
>> I CAN’T TELL.

204
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:35,956
I SPENT A LONG NIGHT IN JAIL

205
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:36,357
THAT NIGHT.

206
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:38,259
>> HE’S SUCH A NICE MAN, DO YOU

207
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,960
THINK YOU COULD SPREAD SOME OF

208
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,129
THAT GOOD KARMA TO SOME OF THE

209
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,930
OTHER EAGLES FANS?

210
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:48,502
DID YOU HEAR IN THE OPENING

211
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:52,940
STATEMENTS, SHE BLAMED MALCOLM

212
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:53,741
BUTLER’S ACTIONS FOR THE LOSS?

213
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:56,344
>> DON’T FORGET THE INJURED

214
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:56,744
HAND.

215
00:07:56,745 --> 00:07:59,547
>> I NOTICED THAT, I CAN’T FAULT

216
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:00,948
HER, SHE’S A PATRIOTS FAN.

217
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:02,750
I TRIED TO HANDLE IT GRACEFULLY.

218
00:08:02,751 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT I LOVE OUR FAN BASE AND I
