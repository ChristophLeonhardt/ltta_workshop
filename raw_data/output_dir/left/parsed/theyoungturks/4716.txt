>> WE ARE LESS THAN ONE WEEK OUT
FROM THE PHILANDO CASTILE
VERDICT WHERE A POLICE OFFICER
WHO ON CAMERA MURDERED HIM AND
WALKED FREE.
SINCE THEN SEVERAL
MORE VIDEOS HAVE BEEN RELEASED.
EACH ONE IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
WATCH.
WE HAVE ONE FOR YOU TODAY
TO GIVE YOU AN INDICATION OF
WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE
MINUTES IMMEDIATELY AFTER
PHILANDO CASTILE WAS SHOT.
WARNING, THIS ONE IS
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO WATCH.
>>
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THAT.
>> CHILD CRYING.
>> I WANT TO TAKE THESE OFF.
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SHOOT ME
OKAY.
I'M ALREADY IN HANDCUFFS.
TELL THEM YOU WISH THAT THEY
DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL ME.
>> I MEAN, I REALLY WATCH THAT
VIDEO BUT WATCHING IT AGAIN ñ
THAT IS A FOUR-YEAR-OLD KID.
THE
VIDEO WAS SHOT IN THE BACK OF A
SQUAD CAR.
PHILANDO CASTILE'S
GIRLFRIEND, AND THEIR DAUGHTER.
IT IS A FOUR-YEAR-OLD CHILD
SAYING I WANT THIS TOWN
TO BE SAFER.
THE SHOOTING WAS BY A
POLICE OFFICER.
>> IT IS OBVIOUS SHE WAS
BRAINWASHED BY BLACK LIVES
MATTER.
SHE WORRIES ABOUT THESE
THINGS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SHE
HAS BEEN TOLD THAT IS WHAT
ACTUALLY HAPPENS.
SHE IS IN THE
BACK OF A POLICE CAR AFTER
WATCHING HER FATHER GET SHOT
MULTIPLE TIMES.
AND SHE WAS IN
THE LINE OF FIRE ON TOP OF IT.
AND NOW SHE IS IN THE BACK OF A
POLICE CAR WITH ENOUGH
WHEREWITHAL TO TELL HER MOTHER
TO KEEP HER HANDCUFFS ON.
HOW
MANY OF YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN IN
THE BACK OF A POLICE CAR?
HOW
MANY ADULTS?
WERE YOU SCARED OR
WORRIED?
OR DID YOU HAVE ENOUGH
WHEREWITHAL TO CALM THE PERSON
DOWN NEXT TO YOU WHO WAS AN
ADULT AND TALK TO HER BECAUSE
YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING MORE TO
HAPPEN?
BECAUSE SHE WANTS THIS
TOWN TO BE SAFER.
THIS ASS HAT
THAT RAN SOME CAMPAIGN ñ I THINK
IT WAS A LOCAL OFFICE, A FORMER
POLICE OFFICER AND HIS AD HAD
POLICE CARS RACING DOWN THE
STREET.
THAT IS NOT SAFE TO A
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY.
YOU CAN KEEP CALLING PEOPLE BAD
GUYS, OR IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF
BLACK PEOPLE TO BE EVIL.
DO YOU
THINK SHE IS?
OR DO YOU THINK
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WILL TEACH
HER THAT SHE CAN'T TRUST YOU?
WHICH ONE IS IT?
IS IT LEARNED
OR IS IT NATURAL?
YOU HAVE TO
ASK
YOURSELF THAT QUESTION.
>> YOUR POINT REMINDED ME OF
WHAT SCARBOROUGH SAID ABOUT
MUSLIMS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
THEY
HATE US BECAUSE THEY HATE US.
NO, THERE IS USUALLY A REASON.
THEY SAY WHY DO BLACK PEOPLE RUN
AWAY FROM THE COPS?
WELL, THIS
IS A REASON.
I BOTH CAN'T
BELIEVE AND CAN BELIEVE THE
SECOND AMENDMENT AND THESEUS IN
THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT GOING
LITERALLY BALLISTIC OVER THIS
CASE.
HERE IS A GUY WHO HAD
EVERY RIGHT TO CARRY THAT
WEAPON.
IF YOU REMEMBER THIS
CASE, THIS GUY GETS PULLED OVER,
HE'S JUST IN THE WRONG PART OF
TOWN BEING BLACK.
HE IS A
LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN, HE HAS A
GOOD JOB, NOT IN TROUBLE WITH
THE LAW BUT THEY KEEP PULLING
HIM OVER.
THEY DON'T GIVE HIM
TICKETS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.
IN THIS CASE HE
GETS PULLED OVER AND SAYS
OFFICER, I HAVE A LEGALLY
REGISTERED WEAPON.
THE GUY FLIPS
OUT AND SHOOTS HIM.
WHAT WAS THE
CUP CHARGED WITH?
2ND DEGREE
MANSLAUGHTER.
IT'S NOT
FIRST-DEGREE, SECOND-DEGREE.
HE
HAD TO SHOW THAT IT WAS SO
NEGLIGENT BUT IT LED TO THE MEN
DYING.
AND HE WAS ALSO CHARGED
WITH TWO FELONY COUNTS OF
INTENTIONALLY DISCHARGING THE
GUN.
HE DIDN'T EVEN GET
CONVICTED OF THAT.
NOTHING AT ALL.
>>DID HE ACCIDENTALLY DISCHARGED
IT SEVEN TIMES?
>> IF YOU ARE A SECOND AMENDMENT
ADVOCATE DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF
YOU SAY YOU CARRY YOUR WEAPON
LEGALLY AND YOU TELL AN OFFICER
HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO EXECUTE
YOU?
THE GUY GOT ACQUITTED, SO I
GUESS THAT MEANS HE HAS EVERY
RIGHT TO EXECUTE YOU.
>> THAT EXACT SITUATION HE DID
EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO.
HE TOLD THE GUY AS SOON AS HE
CAME UP.
THE COP UNLOADED LIKE A
BEAR WAS RUSHING HIM.
THINK
ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FEAR YOU
HAVE TO OPERATE WITH THAT YOU
ARE 2 FEET AWAY FROM A PERSON,
YOU HAVE A GUN POINTED AT THEIR
CHEST.
LET'S SAY THIS GUY
BELIEVED HE HAD A GUN.
HE
THOUGHT THIS GUY IS JUST GOING
TO GO FOR IT.
WHAT KIND OF
BIZARRE FICTIONAL WORLD DOES
THIS COP LIVE IN THAT HE THINKS
A PERSON WOULD TRY TO PULL A GUN
IN THAT SITUATION.
HE FIRES
SEVEN TIMES ALMOST POINT-BLANK.
ALSO KNOWING THAT THERE WERE
OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CAR AND A
FOUR-YEAR-OLD IN THE
LINE OF FIRE.
>> IF HE WAS A WHITE RIGHT-WING
PATRIOT AND THE COPS EXECUTED
HIM, WHAT KIND OF FEAR HE WOULD
THERE BE ON THE RIGHT?
IMAGINE
IT WAS A BUNDY BOY?
THERE WOULD
BE NATIONAL PROTESTS.
>>WHAT EXCUSES THERE FURTHER TO
NOT BE.
NORMALLY THEY COME UP
WITH SOMETHING ñ THEY COMMITTED
A CRIME, THERE WAS A PROFILE ON
HIM.
IN THIS CASE THEY HAVE
NOTHING AND THEY STILL DON'T
CARE.
THEY EVEN KNOW HOW
HYPOCRITICAL IT LOOKS AND EVEN
THEN THEY CAN PRETEND TO CARE.
>>IF YOU DO EVERYTHING RIGHT AND
THEY STILL KILL YOU, THEN DON'T
BLACK PEOPLE HAVE SOME
JUSTIFIABLE REASON TO BE AFRAID
OF THE POLICE?
VIOLENCE DOESN'T
SOLVE VIOLENCE, IT MAKES IT
WORSE.
SHOULD YOU HAVE A
REASONABLE FEAR OF COPS IF YOU
ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN?
I MEAN
LOOK, AS FAR AS BLACK LIVES
MATTER, DO THEY MATTER?
THE MOST
GUTWRENCHING STUFF HAPPENED
AFTER THE SHOOTING.
THE FAMOUS
VIDEO THAT THE WOMAN IN A VIDEO
SHOT, WAS THE COP AFTER
SHOOTING HIM KEEPS POINTING THE
WEAPON AT HIM.
IT TAKES FOREVER
FOR THEM TO GET PHILANDO CASTILE
OUT OF THE CAR AND GET HIM HELP.
THEN THEY HANDCUFF HER.
LET'S
PUT THE RACIAL STUFF ASIDE AND
LET'S LOOK AT CLASS.
IF YOU JUST
SHOT THE MAYOR OF BEVERLY HILLS
AND THEN YOU HANDCUFF HIS WIFE ñ
YOU LET HIM BLEED OUT THEN HE
DIES AND THEN YOU HANDCUFF HIS
WIFE AND HAVE THE FOUR-YEAR-OLD
IN THE BACK THAT YOU DON'T GET ñ
THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE SO
OVERWHELMING.
AND 
HERE THERE ARE
NO CONSEQUENCES AT ALL.
SO
FINALLY WE GET TO ñ PHILANDO
CASTILE IS DEAD, HIS GIRLFRIEND
IS HANDCUFFED, THE IMMEDIATE
REACTION WAS OH MY GOD I
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT THIS GUY.
SOMEBODY HELP!
BUT HIS REACTION
IS COPS NEED TO BE SAFE- THEN I
MAKE SURE I TAKE THE PERSON WHO
HAS BEEN TERRIBLY TRAUMATIZED,
HANDCUFF THEM AND HAVE THEIR
FOUR-YEAR-OLD WATCHING.
THE
THINGS SHE SAID THAT BROOKE MY
HEART WAS, "I DON'T WANT YOU TO
GET SHOOTED."
COINCIDENTALLY I
HAVE A FOUR-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.
THEY SAY THINGS LIKE THAT.
CAN
YOU IMAGINE IF YOUR DAUGHTER HAD
TO SAY THIS TO YOU?
SHE ALSO
SAYS I WISH THIS TOWN WAS SAFER.
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT THE COPS.
SHE AT ONE POINT HUGGED HER MOM
AND SAID I CAN KEEP YOU SAFE.
AS
YOU'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN
THEY DON'T SEEM TO MATTER AS
MUCH AS OTHER PEOPLE IN THE
COUNTRY.
AND THE ONLY WAY SHE
CAN THINK OF TO KEEP HER MOM
SAFE WHEN SHE KEPT SAYING KEEP
YOUR HANDCUFFS ON.
BECAUSE IF
YOU'RE NOT HANDCUFFED AND YOU
ARE 
A BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA,
YOU ARE NOT SAFE.
