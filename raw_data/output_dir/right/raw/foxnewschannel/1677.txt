3
00:00:02,013 --> 00:00:02,715

DEMOCRATS WHICH THEY POLITICALLY

9
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:07,720

PROSPERITY.

59
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,167
MOST THINK THAT KIM JONG UN DOES

60
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:29,368
NOT WANT TO PULL OUT OF THE

61
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:31,470
SUMMIT AND THIS IS MORE

62
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,705
POSTURING AND POSITIONING BEFORE

63
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:33,505
NEGOTIATIONS.

64
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:34,206
THOSE IN WASHINGTON SAY THE

65
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:36,308
PRESIDENT SHOULD STICK TO HIS

66
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:36,709
GUNS.

00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:40,279
CONCESSIONS BEFORE YOU CAN GET

70
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:43,282
TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.

71
00:01:43,282 --> 00:01:46,252
YOU WANT TO NEGOTIATE OUT OF

72
00:01:46,252 --> 00:01:47,519
STRENGTH, NOT WEAKNESS.

73
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,121
>> NORTH KOREA IS A PUBLIC

74
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:49,822

00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:53,859
WHETHER OR NOT THAT HAPPENS IT

78
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:56,428
COULD BE A SIGN OF HOW REAL THIS

79
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:57,062
IS.

80
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:59,198
>> STILL THE LATEST STATEMENT

81
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:00,099
FROM NORTH KOREA DOES INDICATE

82
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,868
THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MAY

83
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:05,671
WANT TO REJECT THE DEMAND FOR

84
00:02:05,671 --> 00:00:00,000
DENUCLEARIZATION.
