Victoria's Secret is under threat because of the demand for plus-sized garments and average-looking models since 1977 Victoria's Secret has been selling lingerie nightgowns women's wear and more to women who want to look their best their motto has always focused on providing people with undergarments that make them look and feel good and the demand has remained high over the decades but now it looks like Victoria's Secret has finally hit a bump in the road the New York Post reports that viewership of Victoria's Secret's most recent show was down by 32 percent over the previous year in their target demographic with their idea of sexy possibly killing their brand they explained investors in Elle brands the lingerie makers parent company are taking a beating as shares are down more than 45% this year making it the worst performing stock in the S&P 500 and they say plummeting stock is self-inflicted because of their use of supermodels in their shows and advertisements Victoria's Secrets once effective marketing strategy of using supermodels Heidi Klum Gisele Bundchen and Gigi Hadid as angel alums has for the most part backfire it's had the same positioning for decades associating sexy with supermodels and it just doesn't work anymore and the reason it doesn't work anymore is because the far left is attempting to change the definition of what's beautiful they're forcing people to become diluted or just lie and claim that everyone and everything is beautiful unless you're a woman in shape with a healthy BMI or what they call generically beautiful coming from the industry I remember seeing this ordinary and plus-size modeling trend begin to happen in New York City and I saw where it was going from early on sure we can accept that a lot of people don't look like supermodels but there is no reason why we should refrain from encouraging people to look their best that is what people want and it is the best option for people but Victoria's Secret has stuck to its guns I'm proud of them as the article explains in 2016 when a plus-size model Ashley Graham made the cover of Sports Illustrated for the first time it prompted the leading plus-size manufacturer only nine apparel to pitch Victoria's Secret on a line of larger sizes unfortunately at this time we are not looking to expand our focus into larger sizes said a senior executive my company has tried numerous times to sell them plus-size but the answer was always not at this time said only nine founder Jamie Gorman but wanting to show women in their best shape is a sin against the left's politically correct gods and Victoria's Secret is suffering as a result but when you look your best you do your best isn't that what Victoria's Secret is trying to show women you'll be in better health and you'll be beautiful who doesn't want to be beautiful well I guess that's the point everyone does want to be beautiful but no one wants to work hard for it anymore so they have to change the definition of beauty but it doesn't just stop with plus-size models according to the New York Post the me2 movement is going for Victoria's Secret recent interviews with the legendary retailer drew attention to his seemingly lack of understanding of the me2 movement and the impact technology is having on retail when asked by the Financial Times whether the fashion industry's objectification of women has encouraged male bad behavior Wexner applied I think that's just complete nonsense Victoria's Secret he argued couldn't take advantage of women because it's run by women the business has been headed by a woman the marketing director is a woman these aren't women that are exploited if models are meant to represent the image of the ideal woman physically if there is one industry out there where superficial things were a reasonable expectation it would be the modeling industry but the left is ugly and they just love ugly they want to destroy beauty and as I have explained in another video before beauty is linked to the vine and the left want to destroy that if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
