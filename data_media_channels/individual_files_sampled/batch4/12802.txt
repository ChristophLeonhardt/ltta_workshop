today we'll be speaking with Charlottesville unite the right speaker and embattled Washington State College Republican President James alte + joshie asthma Erin Bandler and thank goodness Amanda Preston jacquimo joined the panel of deplorable to discuss Kim jong-un backing down Iceland's Down syndrome genocide and the most likes tweet in history I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show we're also going to talk if we have time I should have mentioned why everybody seems to be attacking Lincoln these days there was some graffiti on the Lincoln Memorial last night so we'll be talking about that a little bit later so for our guests today we're lucky to have James Allsop we actually booked him before any of this craziness happened over the weekend between the neo-nazis and anti feh in Charlottesville and we figured he was there and in the spirit of open discourse and debate we would bring him on to tell us what he saw and describe the event to us James do we have you yes I'm here and thank you for having me your name thank you for coming great yeah of course ya know Charlottesville was insane I think that it was one of those situations where going into it nobody really knew exactly what to expect people had different preconceived notions about what might happen what they might see there but once we got there on the ground everything all of the plan kind of went out the window well then I want to talk to you that because you know I also was a college Republican president I remember I was involved in right wing activism back when I was when I when I was a pretty young thing such as you are and my question about this unite the right event is that it's called unite the right it was organized by a number of people but there weren't any mainstream conservatives there there were no representatives from the mainstream of the conservative movement there were no Republican politicians that could be talked about there weren't even alt light people like Serna vich Gavin McGinnis turned it down based stick man one of my favorite characters from the internet they all turned it down so the only people that I see there are neo Nazis neo Confederates white nationalists like Richard Spencer white identity advocates like like identity Europa why my question my straightforward question to you is why would you go what were you thinking going well I was actually going to deliver a speech about nationalism as a concept not you know ethnic nationalism about nationalism I was going to speak about how nationalism is not a hateful philosophy but it's a philosophy that is based around love of you know your country and your fellow countrymen and I don't think it's quite fair to say that the only people there were neo not you know I was on the ground there and I think there were others I think there were white nationalists I think there was Richard Spencer with the leader of it I think there were neo Confederates I think there were there were people I sure like they forget his name the man who organized it who said screw Lincoln I'm a Southern Man I think there was a lot of southern pride there but there were a lot of neo Confederates and I agree with you I don't think it's fair to call them all Nazis but there were swastika flags there and what's worse a bet than that I didn't see anybody from the other side any other people from the right wing so when I see unites the right I think it couldn't even unite the alt-right it couldn't even bring the alt light guys around and then my question to you is knowing that even I understand you wanna give a speech about nationalism knowing the optics of that knowing that you're known by the friends that you keep why appear with Richard Spencer and the KKK well I don't think anybody knew the KKK was going to be there I certainly didn't when I went there and to be fair I don't think the KKK really was there I mean we're seeing this in the media right that the fake news media is trying to make this out to be some kind of KKK event but there were no hood you know that the pictures they were showing were four months ago that's all the fake news narrow you would say that was like the Richard Spencer is a white nationalist and you would say he was involved in leading this event sure so I guess my question then is why would you allow yourself to be associated with somebody like Richard Spencer I don't have to agree with everyone at Adam glint right by appearing at an event I'm not in no way co-signing the opinions of everyone else who's there of course I think but did you agree with anyone at that event is I understand if they get some they have some kook's and then they have other points of view and it's a free speech event and it's a unite the right I understand that that would be a different thing but did you agree with it with any of these people there it depends what topic you're talking about I mean on something like like economics for example Spencer and I have very different philosophies about a lot of that story and by the way we would have heard what all of these opinions are we would have heard all these different opinions and it could have an accurate representation and understand what these people actually believed in if the event had been allowed to continue I agree there clearly the police did very little clearly an Tifa were bullying everybody all around you know it's in the in the fake news media but occasionally they get something right this event has been called unite the white do you do you think that there was a white identity that was the major component of this event I can't speak for everyone else who was there I know that I was going to speak about national ago do you think the event was primarily a white identity event I understand you were there for that I'm not I'm not asking about your motives I'm just asking if you think that was what the event was I think that may have been an aspect of it sure sure I mean but at the same time you know we have these events across the country we have black lives matter events we have La Raza on hundreds of college campuses black and Hispanic identity is completely obscene as completely okay by course into the mainstream media and at left so but do you think those are okay do you think that lives matter in La Raza and all those other identity ethnic identity groups are all right and if you don't think so as I don't I don't so then why is it any better when we do it when white people do I don't condone violence yeah no I don't condone by but I'm not talking about violence I'm talking about I'm talking about this identity mob organizer thing note that now we're seeing replicated in some ways on the old right sure but I think it's fair to say you can differentiate between black identity movements like the hotep movement for example and black lives matter so I guess black lives matter wasn't a great example I completely you know I think that the violence perpetrated by people like black white black lives matter or La Raza in California that's a despicable but I don't necessarily think there's there's something wrong with you know these identity movements because there is a you know one of the unfortunate truth when you look at societies that have a lot of political stratification like we do is that people will often align along racial lines I'm not saying that's good or bad I'm not saying that that's the point you think we what you think we have to admit it and we have to accept it and are you saying that the right in this country basically has to appeal to white identity if it's going to have a future I'm saying well I wouldn't say it like that but I think what you're seeing is if you look at the data from Pew Research you're seeing that the Republican Party is becoming more and more made up of white people and you're saying that that actually minorities african-americans and Hispanics are becoming further left you're also seeing why Tamara to become further right so and that trend has been happening since the 70s and as that trend continues I think we will see some you'll continue to see political realignment in that way I think it depends I grant you some of that I think it depends a little bit on how you define left and right from the 70s through the 80s and 90s and 2000's but I'm a little confused because the alt-right has you know embrace I think it basically defined itself as you are defining it leaning in toward white identity appealing to white demographics and yet they all read is very new movement as the political movements only about a year old in public and during Barack Obama's presidency we did not see the Tea Party and other grassroots movements appealing to white demographics and yet we took over the whole country we won so much we almost got sick and tired of winning we took a thousand seats in state legislatures we got 24 at governorships out of 32 Republican state legislatures we took the Congress the Senate and the presidency it looks like we did pretty well without explicitly appealing to white identity tell me I'm wrong and we got nothing and we got nothing done I mean Obamacare still in place we have you know no new protections on trade we didn't build the wall Republicans guns but Republicans are great at getting in power but they're only getting things done when they get in power but I exact a little confusing cumulatively now it seems to me that you're you're saying that as an electoral strategy in order to win elections we need to appeal to white demographics but that doesn't seem true from the last eight years but and then you'll say the trouble is we get elected we don't do it I totally grant you that I absolutely grant you that the Republicans in Congress have been squishy and basically useless but they seem to be different questions right how do we win elections what do we appeal to and how do we operate once we're in office I think we can't be purely introspective when we talk about this question I think we also have to look at the Democratic Party and the Democrats have been going down this road where they're employing a lot of anti white rhetoric and they're aligning themselves with people who are very very anti whites with anti white messaging and look you know for young white college guys like myself who see a lot of that messaging young male going on we're told about white privilege and how white men are responsible for everything the the reaction for some people is to fold and say yes you're right I'm evil because I'm white but for a lot of people it's to reject that narrative entirely and say look you know that right right throughout things yeah I totally understand it seems to me that for a lot of people your age a little bit younger even even as old as I am there we were told we were brought up in this milieu of feminism and being told that straight men are bad and white men are bad and this that and the other thing my concern is that seems to have provoked a reactionary response that is feeding the worst elements of the identity politics that drove us crazy in the first place do you have any thoughts on that yeah no I can understand that but I think we also have to look at this as a defensive measure right there there is a perceived attack and you know whether this is entirely legitimate or not there is a perceived attack on on white people in this country it's coming from the media it's coming from govern it government is coming through the education system with affirmative action and there's a lot to be said for that if they're the only arrears silicon sure absolutely Silicon Valley puts out these numbers and these diversity reports every year it's you know the diversity reports which are essentially they're bragging about how many fewer white people they hired and you know look I don't think anybody should should be subjected to that I say and I would say that for any race I don't think any race should should have to be you know subjected to that kind of thing no one and at the same time go ahead I'm sorry go ahead okay okay I'll finish quickly I was going to say that every year you know Republican politicians and Democrat politicians consistently agree on bringing in more h-1b visa applicants this has the effect of driving down wages for American labor that's really what I'm concerned mostly about is an America first policy when it comes to our trade and our immigration and reducing trade and immigration I agree entirely which brings me back to my first question believe it or not there are other groups that have opposed immigration and have advocated for lower legal and illegal immigration who have advocated for trade protective trade tariffs since the since the nineties to differing degrees of affect obviously the Bush administration did not take immigration enforcement terribly seriously tried to push amnesty and and so but that is the understatement of the year don't you think there are other groups that you can align yourselves with it aren't as those who showed up in Charlottesville aren't explicitly white identity white nationalist like Richard Spencer I'll let you answer and then there's there is something I'd like you to respond to that I was perusing on your YouTube channel yeah no certainly and I consider myself to be a paler conservative look I got into politics back in 2012 with Ron Paul so I'm coming at policy from it we all are especially all when we were all young evenly yeah we're all naive and thinking about you know winning talk i strategies and stuff back in 2012 though it was a good time but so I come at it from a libertarian perspective with a lot of this stuff and so I I look when I when I look at politicians at people like Paul Nayland who are excellent representations of what I believe America first policy should be I like people like Steve King is another fantastic example of someone who is putting you know these workers first actually did an interview with Paul Nalin on my youtube channel where we talked about a lot of the stuff we talked about how the unit party the Republicans and the Democrats are both kind of screwing the American worker and making things worse for everyday Americans this is you know just to get that I don't want to drive a Ron Paul too quickly this is one of the reasons why I'm interested in your videos and I remember you know when I was I was joking that it's 17 every kid every young kid on the right resigned ran and his convinced he knows everything for about six months and then he kind of floats away from it usually move away from libertarianism what have you and my worry with a lot of young people and with you as well James I worry that people are getting famous too young and they're espousing his views too young views that might change in views that might be nuanced and I think you're playing with bad juju with these all right guys and to give an example I will we have a clip of Richard Spencer from your channel from a speech he gave at the Lincoln Memorial that's clip two zero zero one deal is fighting for freedom we are fighting for the constitution we are fighting to the prank of foreign or otherwise up against the five years activity here fundamentally fighting and our allies we are fundamentally fighting for something that is bigger than ourselves we are fighting to be parts of a family together we are fighting to be strong again to be beautiful again we are fighting to be powerful again and a sea of weakness and hopelessness that is our battle I think he's absolutely honest and absolutely right in describing what he's doing this this quest for meaning they're trying they don't really care about the Constitution that you know there's that meme but my Constitution my Constitution doesn't pretend anything if you don't have voting demographics so it is how it how it goes online the the question here I wonder is what is that meaning what is that meaning that the alright is trying to embrace it seems to me it's just the white race its color your skin and communities that have historically lived near each other am I wrong well I think you'd have to ask which would Spencer that question I I can't defend or or and I don't have any interest in defending everything Richards ever said you know look rich I only asked you because it was on your channel I only asked you because I know you were at the event and if you have in it you know you care you've spent more time with these guys than I had I think what they would say is that they are fighting to - they're fighting to I guess it rum continued the flame of Western civilization right you know people throughout Western civilization throughout history have built great things built great empires done great things you know the foundations of modern philosophy and art and music all of this comes out of a really you know mostly Western Europe of core and they're fighting to continue that that cultural tradition and I don't see anything wrong with that I agree and what I realized and then this is my essential question on that because I think that's exactly right I would I am an evangelist for Western culture it's obviously the greatest civilization the history of man obviously providentially guided what is Western coal because my I highly suspect that most of these people know very little about Western culture what is it what is what is the West what is Western culture well I would actually argue that that one of the greatest manifestations of Western culture and values er the United States founding documents it is this idea that we can have a society that guarantees freedom and liberties to people but also inspires you to work towards bettering yourself you know you're ultimately responsible for yourself and the if you think back in 1700 then late seventeen hundreds we were a country and we were founded as a country with a very very small State for a reason but we were also a country with very large you know church groups right and communities voluntary communities voluntary Association we were founded as a country that would be free from the trappings of European royalty I guess you could say very religious about all of Europe is running away from Christianity of course absolutely and and equalitarian by the way around are created equal and are endowed by the creator with unalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness which would traditionally be read and if you look at the seventeen if you look at the 1790 Naturalization Act it's very interesting because they actually make it a required provision where people who emigrate from Europe renounce all of their former titles you know you were a lord or or some kind of you know royalty in Europe you actually had to give that up and to to become an American citizen you had to you know accept that kind of that kind of you know abandonment of the former hierarchy right I think that right the American values we were founded on are actually one of the greatest manifestations of Western civilization I agree and now my so my question for all of these guys who have a stated goal which is exactly the same as my stated goal which is to promote Western culture and and defend Western culture but as we just said the the Western culture it was expressed in these founding documents in the the notion that we are endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights all of these guys were Christian basically the West it seems to me as a combination of Athens in Jerusalem that spread throughout Europe for two thousand years ago seemed in the United States and and elsewhere but Christianity is the central factor right cult culture comes from cult it's what we so are these guys Christian are you Christian yeah I was raised Christian right I consider myself to be very culturally Christian you mean by that before we go yeah okay I'm sorry continue yeah no no I honor that yes no I believe that the Ten Commandment Kent Ten Commandments and the biblical teachings are a fantastic foundation and should be the bedrock of Western civilization and culture the Ten Commandments and and the ideas expressed in the Bible should really be the guiding light for how we treat each other and how we you know manage our day-to-day dealings you sound mostly Irish into me but where so where do you disagree with them well it's not that I disagree it's just that I I don't participate in organized religion to the extent where I would be comfortable calling myself you know Christian you believe in Jesus in that degree sure I think everybody does don't think you believe that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God who came down to save all of mankind and was killed and then on the third day was literally resurrected to redeem man you know I'm not certain again I'm not I'm not up on my Christian theology but I do believe in these teachings and and I think that it is absolutely imperative that we we have respect for the Christian tradition yeah yeah I see your point the reason I want to interject a little bit here is I think there are two issues with what you've said I think the phrase culturally Christian I've heard Richard Spencer describe himself that way too I think it is nonsense I think it is etymologically not impossible I think it's semantic nonsense because the word culture comes from cult right it's what we worship so to say one is culturally Christian would appear to me to say we believe in Christ we believe in Christianity and yet whenever anyone says that there is a caveat that says I like Christianity I like the churches I like the civilization the Christianity produced but I just don't believe in the thing that produced it I don't believe in the thing that animated it and I don't know I see this a lot on the left I talk about this all the time lefties want to drink decaf coffee you know they want to get a university degree without a university education they always want the semblance of the thing the appearance of the thing but not the essence of the thing not the thing that animates it and so I wonder to the second point of what you've talked about you say you believe that the 10 commandments ought to be the structure of civil the bedrock of civilization the Christian foundation there ought to be more churches for more civic society civil society but why if it isn't true if it if it if the Ten Commandments don't come from God why should why should they be the foundation of society or on the flipside why have they worked well I think that they have objectively produced the best societies in the whole history you know that and and so you know even if you were to take the religious aspect out of it you could say that these values if you look at these values from a from a you know non religious perspective you could say these values have produced these great societies and on that merit you know they should be but why have they produced a great as deities because they're congruous and good I'm not I'm not sure I are they good idea I'm right this is one argument for God right as you keep you saying why is this better than that why is this better than that and eventually you get to the perfect good so my only question is I think people Bend themselves over backwards to try to make Christianity secular on the alright and I just don't not not only do I now see if it's possible I don't see why they would do it in the first place yeah no I'm I don't really inherently disagree with you I I think you're probably correct about a lot of this it's not something but here's the thing it's not something that is I guess that I spend a lot of time thinking about perhaps I should think about it more I don't and I don't by the way I don't mean this in I don't mean to be patronizing I know I sound like I'm patronizing but I think there are a lot of young conservatives that you represent and that you can speak to and that you're a voice for and I think that on the road of thinking thoughtfully and of reading a lot of books people come up with some kooky ideas and go down bad paths and people who are in the public eye who go on camera have the misfortune of knowing that the Internet is forever and you're going to be chased by this for the rest of your life and it it might behoove people to think about the conclusions the logical extremes of their ideas before they make grand statements and the reason we talk about Christianity is it seems that the religion the Christianity that created the West the west of the alt-right alleges to defend objects to a great many things that the alt-right is advocating and doing in particular the racist aspect of it in particular separating people categorically by race advocating things like the ethnos state so on and so forth it seems to me I mean I think you would be bored if I read all of the all of the scriptures about it you probably take my word for it but there are endless scriptures that talk about this this fundamental contradiction the alt-right seems to me irreconcilable and shows the movement for what it is which i think is half-witted sort of like the New York Times editorial board you know this these guys who are a little bit smart and so they convince the New York Times readers to believe their idiocy but I really think it's it's half-witted you can respond so yeah sure so I guess the question then you have to ask is where the founding fathers wrong because again going back to 1790 and and we're saying that you know these people were Christians I would have actually said they're theists but if we want to say they're Christians that's that's fine thank you very many of them were Christian I think some were deistic there was some plurality but they all came from the Puritan stock that came over here on the Mayflower ya know yeah exactly right so then you look at the 1792 Naturalization Immigration Act and the 1790 Naturals or Immigration Act I should say explicitly restricted citizenship to free white people of good character and that was a standard up until the the mid to late 1800s and so I guess we could then say you know where the founder is wrong to say well I don't like that generally you would surely you would agree that history requires context and that the Society of 2017 excuse me it's quite different than the Society the late 18th century of course yeah no of course so therefore laws would change right opinions would change even people would change a people that have been held in bondage for 200 years in the Americas or who have come out of a civilization in Africa that is in very few ways similar to the civilization of the West sure later their position might be a little different in society and the laws would reflect that after the slaves are emancipated after Jim Crow is obliterated and you know we arrived at 2017 in a basically equalitarian play right and I'm not arguing that we should you know return to this or anything I'm just saying that this is this is the situation and this is the system that the founding fathers set up that these Christian set up and throughout the vast majority of the Christian history these kind of policies were accepted and were put in place and so it's actually a relatively short time in the Christian history that we've we believed in this notion of a callous Arian seems to me that slavery especially slavery's we're talking about in the United States is an aberration in the history of the West it wasn't practiced it certainly not as it was in the United States for all of the West and and by the way that slavery only came about because we interacted with people for the first time in the west coast of Africa in a in a trade relationship well that's not entirely true I mean the Europeans held plates for many years slavery can trace its roots back to you know the Islamic world you know and uh the Islamic I'm not denying that there was a Lavery in the West the gorse had helots and the Romans had slaves but those institutions of slavery were quite different and they they also were less racial depending on depending on which errors in which places we're talking about in history the West sure and there were also quite a bit more brutal and then so it's important to remember that the American form of slavery was actually and this is I'm sure this will be cut out of context somewhere but the American form of slavery is actually one of the the gentle ER forms of slavery that existed you know the Egyptians would actually you know do horrible things to their slaves or castration etc before they would ever take them as as into bondage and so yeah you know history is history is replete with brutality and horrible things sure and parts of the American experience of slavery different different decades were different but parts were quite brutal in other other parts of relatively less perhaps today than in the years right before the war I suppose that's right you know one issue because we've been kind of dancing around the culture and race and it seems to me that you know any any racial categorical differences as they would matter for Public Policy might just as easily be explained by culture as by genetics I know a lot of people on the old rights say that race and culture are inextricably linked would you agree with that I don't think that's no I don't think that's entirely true I agree also I just see it flying around quite a lot and I think that's another example of some of the stupidities that the allright is promulgating the other is do we need to worry about the thing that they can't stop talking about is racial differences in IQ as posited by charles murray is there is there any implication for Public Policy by these handfuls of studies that have shown some correlation well I don't know if it's if there's necessarily an implication for Public Policy but I think it's an a it's an important thing to understand because it helps us understand why certain groups tend to on average I'll be very clear 10 - on average perform differently than others in society you look at why there are some of the Asians for example to get into very top - your schools why Asians do so well in the SAT well it's it's due to the fact that Asians tend to have an IQ closer to around 110 you don't think it's culturally over there because they because those those cultural groups put more of an emphasis on studying more of an emphasis on schooling you know think it's possibly explain well that what scientists would argue is that it's a mixture of both but what scientists would argue I don't have any scientists and I've only got you I'm kidding I I drew well I tried to make crazy good luck to you this is the thing lefties do they would say well what I think scientists would argue is I think I don't know you don't know any scientists I I'm not a scientist myself just a gentleman right guys right yeah well go ahead you're ready to split yeah no and this is very well researched that many of the people who research is kind of think professionally argue that intelligence is about 80% genetic and about 20% cultural and and through the the nurture it's a nature versus nurture debate right and so while certain things that are our cultural can influence your ultimate intelligence you know if you if you are you know born to you know brain surgeon parents but you're raised in a crack house you're probably not going to be as smart as someone who is born to more average parents who's raised it by you know brain surgeons so yeah of course no one's did not no one would ever deny that cultural and and nurture nurturing aspects can affect some with ultimate intelligence but we can't dismiss the genetic aspect of intelligibly whether if sure so whether that that is true or not you don't think that there's any implication of that for policy in the US no I I don't necessarily think so yeah that's kind of a debate question I think that we ought to take into account the alleged racial differences in IQ or categorical differences in IQ when we make public policy at the federal level or at the local level I don't I don't think no I I don't think I don't think we should because I think it'd be unconstitutional right I think there would be issues with discrimination and and one of the the failings of social science like this is that it is not uniform right there are bell curves and when you understand the bell curve you understand that there are you know a large population in the middle but there are you know twelve and a half percent of the population that's on that upper echelon and you know twelve and a percent that's on the lower lashline and so there is certainly crossover right there are thousands if not millions of people who are you know Hispanic and black in this country who are smarter than Asian people that's and that's of course that's true you're only going to debate that do you agree as I I think you're you're stating well and absolutely I also think there shouldn't be any any public policy drawn from these social scientific studies but do you agree with the deputy you know the alright is such a vague term Hillary Clinton gave me the name for my panel the panel of deplorable z when she lumped basically all right wingers in with this this term it's been watered down to nothing Milo innopolis said he was in and then he isn't in it and then yada yada yada some of the thought leaders that people have seem to agree on of the all right the mile up witness piece for instance Richard Spencer Vox day Jared Taylor people who came up with the term who promote the term they've given definitions of the alright that are explicitly racial do you agree that those are the definitions of the all right or are Richard Spencer and all those guys wrong I think that well I haven't read their their definition so I'm not going to latch on to one of them specifically and agree to excite know what what I think it green to I can tell you what it is I'll read Vox days says well he gives fourteen points which for those who have been in the dregs of the internet for a while know what the implication of that is but Vox Dei says the alt-right does not believe in general supremacy of any race nation people were subspecies interesting choice of words through every race Nation people and human subspecies has its own strengths and weaknesses and possesses the right to dwell unmolested in the native culture perverse its anti-equality rien it believes identity leads culture which leads politics the Richard Spencer says it's essentially about racial identity he had that kind of flashy creepy video on his old version of alright calm which has changed Jared Spencer there Jared Spencer Jared Taylor head of American Renaissance also popularized the term Walt right says that it's explicitly about turning from conservatism to an alternative which is where the alt comes from which is essentially a white identity movement would you agree with any of those or do you think those guys get the alt-right wrong well I think the you certainly I don't know I'm not going to agree to any of those I haven't really thought about that to a level where I can agree to that but what I will say is that I think it's important to understand that that race is a real concept we can't be we can't be afraid of talking about race as conservatives has have for so long but I think the problem that conservatives have a lot of conservatives I won't speak for all of them is that they've been so afraid to address differences in in racial groups for the longest time and it's led to this almost paralysis whether whether too afraid to even address the topic and this is an area where where the left has you know the left has identified the problem but they haven't identified the right to live identify the absolute wrong solution my opinion you know that they've identified that different racial groups tend to have different interests and you know that doesn't speak for every individual of course but there tend to be different interests for these different groups and so they've they've been at they've been able to exploit that for political gain you think of the Obama coalition of the ascendant for example is a fantastic example of that and so but I what do you what do you mean by different interracial this because I do agree with you conservatives are squeamish to talk about race because anytime they talk about taxes they get called a racist and Coulter once told me that when a liberal calls you a racist you know you've won the argument but there there are legitimate racists out there as well you know my I don't want to be called a racist by the left because I'm not a racist it's not because I'm afraid of the left or something like that so what are those racial interests of those groups what are you say we're afraid to about race what should we be talking about with regard to race so I'll give you examples of those different interests for example if you look at how Hispanics tend to vote in this country a Pew Research has done fantastic research on all of this Hispanics will tend to vote because they they come when you think about this they come generally from societies with large governments they have a culture that that is are they they bring over a tradition of large government when they emigrate here Hispanic immigrants will vote 70 to 34 they pull 70 to 30 for bigger governor right when you ask them if they support bigger or smaller government they say bigger government what about my children even my favorite people in the world the Cubans who gave us excellent cigars and music and fled that bum Fidel Castro those guys wrote where they vote about a hundred to zero Republican and they come from the biggest government islands that you could imagine doesn't that fly in the face of those those numbers well and you can always find an anecdote to disprove attract I don't think a country is an ESCO I think Cuba is a pretty large number of people they swing Florida sure and and they vote you know 60/40 for Republicans but when we're talking about Hispanics broadly that's not the trend that exists the trend as research and I'm not I'm not making this up you can look at your research ed who is cited multiple times on the daily wire you can look at P research and they will corroborate this that Hispanics tended to go 70 30 for bigger government sure I don't deny it but anything's to me what you're talking about now is culture rather than race perhaps I'm misunderstanding what you're saying but it seems to me that race is a biological construct and that culture is a culture cultural construct a social construct is that wrong so if it we're talking about big government people coming from different areas in both 70/30 or 60/40 or whatever that seems to me not biological are you are you suggesting that we need to talk about biological implications of different peoples or just cultural ones no look I look I don't want to get into those semantics of that all I'm telling you is that these are how you know these different immigrant groups vote but I'm not I don't know by the way people should remember that semantics means meaning so when people say well that's just semantics they mean to say it's just trivial but it is a meaningful distinction that's the main distinction I'm asking about or are you only talking about culture or are you too talking about rates because everything you've said is cultural and I agree we need to teach people from other cultures to vote for Republicans I think that should be priority number one but are we close the borders and stop them from immigrating sure there are plenty of the good arguments for lower immigration for building the wall absolutely but are there any arguments explicitly about race about the physical aspect the biological aspect are you just talking cultural well Michael I don't know why they vote the way they do I don't know why the way way why they vote for bigger government you think there might be a biological aspect to it no you not only think so I haven't seen I haven't seen your research no I don't know look I don't know um I don't I'm willing to bet I'd bet my four hundred buckaroo Bureau that there is no biological impetus to to vote for Republican other than maybe a little more testosterone now who knows who knows do you already had that that's interesting they have a budget on that yes wait so all right I think we've gone over this I've grilled you enough do you review you've you've been taken around on this whole thing you had to step down I think as the head of the Washington State Republicans is that right I was not forced to do anything I immediately planning on doing that for weeks before yeah no I I wanted to get let them start the year fresh we're starting school in a week I wanted to let them start without with distraction-free do you do you regret going to the event I've even hammered about this I think you've been rightly hammered about this but I give a little grace to you because I understand that ideas can lead to ideas and some of these guys are somewhat articulate and it's easy to think the wrong things sometimes do you regret going to wish you hadn't done it no not at all I think that it's important to provide media coverage of events like this that is going to be representative of the actual event when you look at the reports that came out from places like the New York Times or CNN or Fox News they were latching onto that one or two pictures of the guy with the swastika flag and saying this is what the event is this is this is all these things all of the organizers were white identity advocates you'll grant that I'm not saying they're all Hitler Youth I'm saying they all were advocating white identity there were in organizers who came from any other branch of the right you will at least grant them that premise I don't think that's actually that's not actually true there were the other ones ictus you were there people like Augustus Invictus like Christopher Cantwell these people are are libertarians you know these people come from the libertarian Estes invictus is a former and current candidate for libertarian libertarian or for the Senate as a libertarian in Florida right this there was a wide swath of people from the right wing invited there but I would also have to put well there were a lot of were invited I grant you there were a lot who were invited but even people who have played around with you all right like Gavin Gavin McGinnis said no thank you I don't want a part of it but earlier on you had granted to me that a major a foundational part of this march in this rally was white identity do you now disagree with that no no I don't push back on that at all and I think that but I disagree with the inherent assertion that that's a bad thing right because again we see these people all across the country organizing for black interests organizing for black identity for Hispanic identity for Asian American identity but we don't see anything wrong we criticize them for doing that don't we maybe you do but I don't you don't all right maybe you can I look I don't see anything wrong with with finding a common cause with a community like that you think that race has won outright using race as a category is a primary and important political grouping do you think it's worth worth bringing more racial identity politics to the fore in America I don't well that's speaking of some kind of grand strategy context I don't know about about all that but I do know that that you know race is very important for a lot of people in this country for it's very important for a lot of black people very important for a lot of Hispanics for a lot of Asians and it historically really hasn't been that important for white people but I think that is changing at all of these anti white attacks these anti white narratives going on in the media and government it's causing people to become conscious of their status as a white person which is then leading them toward things like the all right I I agree there has been a backlash the left the left started the fight on racial identity politics I think it's a very bad thing and ought to be opposed or perhaps you disagree with me on that but nevertheless before we go we've we've taught you what ideal Society I'd agree with you I I would agree with that ideal right I would absolutely love for us to be able to drop at any politics and talk about you know the benefits of laissez-faire capitalism and the free market that will be fantastic but unfortunately what we're seeing is that these people on the Left are not going to take their foot off the gas now they're going to keep attacking white people keep blaming white people keep demonizing white people in this country as the sources root of all evil and I think that's I think that's silly and I think unfortunately that's going to lead to to more and more of this type of stratification so I would love for us to be able to go back you know six years or whatever and talk about you know the intricacies of healthcare policy or something but that's really not what's what is being pushed by the left we're not even talking I don't think anybody ever wants to talk about the intricacies of healthcare policy or tax taxes insurance or whatever I it's very boring it's always been a cultural battle there have always been cultural warriors and their end the primary motivator of that cultural war especially on the right has historically been the primary animator of the Western civilization that we say that we're going to offend Christianity it seems to me now that that is being substituted for white race and I think you would probably grant me that do you think that's a good thing do you think that's a necessary thing do you think that that's something we should oppose for both practical and moral reasons as I do well I think that I don't think they are necessarily different I think that when you look into I'm going to read your Bible James I think I'm going to send you all those well hold on hold that I compiled I would appreciate that yeah but but I think when you see people arguing for a lot of stuff they're arguing for Christian civilization right they're arguing for a continuance of Western Christians they just don't practice oceanic and so but they do want Christian civilization I agree with you I'm someone do this is quite imagine ooh like like I I haven't taken a poll I didn't take a poll on everyone was it unites the right on what their faith is I would be willing to bet though that the majority of them are probably Christians I well we'd have to define our terms but I would happily bet you my Shapiro check on that we'll have we'll have to say we'll have to see about that I'm James it has been very nice having you thank you for coming on I appreciate it and and we will we'll talk to you again in the future I'm sure right thank you very much I appreciate it thank you all right that was a long one we've got to introduce our panel of

long so thank you so much for everyone who is a subscriber if you're a subscriber right now go over to daily wire.com and you'll be able to watch the rest finally this panel of deplorable x' and if you're not a subscriber but subscribe what are you waiting for go over now daily wire.com you'll get may you'll get the intro flavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show and the leftist tears tumblr you can keep your leftist here's hot or cold always salty and delicious go there right now daily wire calm all right we don't have to talk about this Charlotte's whole thing anymore do we we've talked about it so much let's get rid of it we have to move on to much more important news than the neo-nazis attacks in the United States we have to talk about Donald Trump's tweeting Donald Trump's wonderful tweeting Kim jong-un has backed away from a threatened missile strike on Guam which President Trump hailed as a very wise and well reasoned decision the alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable with an exclamation point in true trumpian fashion Josh you're a foreign policy guy president Trump has received a lot of criticism for his comments in the lead-up to this the fire and fury the world has never seen anything like this but did they work seems like they worked well can I just say that I don't think it's a good idea to be so cavalier about tweeting national security and foreign policy concerns why it seems to have worked well the Trump hate it looks like they're not going to buy Wow well what hasn't been covered is the fact that we have been negotiating with the North Koreans throw back doored diplomatic Channel sure US envoy for North Korea Joseph UN he's been talking to his North Korean counterpart and they've been kind of negotiating some sort of truce or at least a temporary so that hasn't been covered ah that's much less interesting in the tweets I bring the back channels to Kim Jong woman yeah Amanda what do you think between her I think there was a lot of media hysteria over it this language is actually not unprecedented we saw Bill Clinton Barack Obama say similar thanks not on Twitter but they did a similar thing so it wasn't as you know insane as people were making it out to be I don't think it hurt anything with North Korea I don't think they were going to do anything in Guam anyhow they know the United States kind of literates them I think that was just you know condone doing what he does flexing his muscles he just doesn't want I don't think he has a lot of muscle oh my god oh yeah this is Joey I don't I said that's like a week and a half ago but I didn't think they were going to clearly aren't going to do anything and we're working the diplomatic way but what Trump says on Twitter I just don't think I had that big of an effect I don't think it hurt us but it wasn't as Extreme as the media made that to me did Trump win here despite himself himself Aaron well I think that he actually did not help themselves because I think that tough language does help when it comes to dealing with the roll maniacs like Kim jong-un you know because the biggest deterrent is strength no peace - strength is Reagan always said and so I think that I think that had Trump like not fall through on that threat had North Korea actually like attack mom so that's been it would have been bad but because he didn't have to and North Koreans backed off it was okay she talked to us and Kim Jeong goes back down and sort of like a phantom it looks like a Trump win yeah it doesn't light assembly in that regard yeah I love seeing the future like how that will play out with other Rose regimes like Iran and Syria and so forth but for now it seems like a win yeah but there's this trouble that now so we were all looking forward we're going to blast this guy off the police to the earth was going to be a catastrophe up because probably Seoul would have been destroyed right but now we've saved Seoul we save Guam we've saved Los Angeles in my little studio but Kim is still in power so are we just kicking the can down the road Josh do we is there any hope for regime change well it's interesting invention that general mattis and Secretary of State killer Sun actually penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal explicitly saying that there will be no regime change they wanted to make that clear so I think the Kim regime has to be dealt with but it's not a good idea to deal with it right now we have to deal with our immediate national security concerns and making sure that our partners in the Pacific are taken care of and that includes promoting missile defense in the region that includes making sure that our bases have the resources and the money they need to function properly but you know this has been the argument since the 90s right bill Bill Clinton is the first president to deal real crisis in North Korea and luckily for him Kim il-sung dies and there are their famines and he gets to kick the can down the road president bush obviously is dealing with other wars meanwhile North Korea shoots off missiles is mustn't this be dealt with at some point well Trump has been doing a good job at pressuring China and I think that's the key might this whole thing in the weeks leading up to the unprecedented UN sanctions on on North Korea which you know sanctions to a billion dollars worth of exports coal you know North Korea's primary exports primarily to China China didn't veto that that resolution which is huge and the reason they didn't veto that is because the Trump administration pressured China and said if you veto that bill we are going to place sanctions on Chinese banks Chinese banks that may or may not be doing business with North Korea so the Chinese were scared in the back down that's the key to this whole thing we have to work with the the framework in the reason we have to work with partners in the region to pressure North Korea I mean simply striking them that's not going to get anywhere you know Kim is still going to be in power and it's going to lead to you know this standoff so you're you're advocating the art of the deal you're proponents OMI we make the best deals don't we folks all right enough of that Kim we have to talk about speaking of cartoonish evil we have to talk about Iceland committing a genocide against down-syndrome people this is from I think CBS well with the rise of prenatal screening tests across Europe in the United States the number of babies born with Down syndrome has significantly decreased but few countries have come as close to eradicating Down syndrome births as Iceland eradicating Down syndrome birth amanda has there ever been a more absurd euphemism for killing a lot of people everything about abortion is cloaked in euphemism and this is particularly disgusting because they're framing this is a moral good that we're eradicating Down syndrome no you murdered all the preborn babies who had Down syndrome that's not a scientific advancement that's that it didn't cure it right all right this is I mean it's interesting too because we just had this discuss I'm not excusing this is disgusting all these neo-nazis in Charles ville vile stuff okay you want to talk about Nazism what about this I mean we're not going to say anything about eliminating human beings that you deem unworthy of life do eugenic organizing yeah I'm gonna kill the immigration so we have the same extreme outrage over this as we did for those 200 losers who of course there's a disgusting murder I'm not again I'm not downplaying that but where is the outrage over this and again this is happening in America too this is not just some foreign thing that's going on it's happened right in the United States every day of course and you know that the left all the time they make these quality of life arguments that when they're talking about euthanasia or they're talking about a boring mentally retarded babies and syndrome why is there any argument for quality of life do their arguments hold any sway or is it just sophistry it's just I mean how to work who are they to say about what the best quality of life of somebody is I think the first press aside that is the person themselves or their family members and so forth not for them to say I'm actually discussing to say that somebody can't live about that is because they have like Down syndrome or like your ability or something and is that it's your point in the United States I think by six percent of abortions are done because because of they found out they have those conditions like you're uploading it now syndrome and so forth and it's disgusting and it's very reminiscent oh the next movement I leave the newly 1920s over which Marx is saying you're the founder Planned Parenthood was a big supporter of and so forth I mean it really is evil it's like not to give them basically it's disgusting well with the advance with the advance of these public policies and then with the advance of designer babies we're seeing new stories about that every day will we eventually eliminate Down syndrome people will we not see anymore Down syndrome people so I think we have to draw a distinction between the abortion element and genetic engineering I don't think there's anything morally wrong with gene therapy with correcting these these issues that you know that are going to put pressure on families I mean we can't discount the financial costs the emotional cost all these things I mean there is something to be said about these stressors involved with having children with the genetic disorders so like Down syndrome would it be preferable if we could correct it in the womb or would it not be preferable um or does it depend on the family some families want to get get rid of their kid and some well I think fundamentally parents have the right to know so I think arguments that are suggesting that both parents know you know they'll get rid of the baby that's 100 percent they have a right to have a prenatal screening or something yes 100 percent they need to know what they're getting into and then you know the rest of discussions of public policy discussion you know I don't know about you but we've been talking about a story right now that isn't a tweet for far too long so I think we have to go back at weed President Obama has now the most liked tweet in the history of tweeting this came in the wake of the terror attack in Charlottesville he quoted no one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion and I think at the Nelson Mandela quote isn't it the so Amanda is this because it's a poignant message or god help us is there nostalgia for Barack Obama perhaps there is nostalgia for Barack Obama I I don't see why I mean it's interesting that he's the one coming out and saying this under his administration we thought endless identity politics he helped bolster and legitimize the black lives matter movement invited them to the White House all of this racial division was in Park helped by President Barack Obama and his administration and now we're seeing with nasty reactionary stuff this is all of course not 100% on President Obama but it's just interesting to see that he pushes this identity politic you know this implicit bias right that we all apparently have but then he quotes he tweets that so which is it am i inherently bias and racist because I'm white or am I not or my taught that so it contradicts his message and it's just interesting that he helps promote this backlash and this and you know racism on the left and now he's coming to save everyone it's just it's very interesting and it does raise a question which is is that quote is it true that no one is born that way is it that we only learn hatred or is it the case that we're all born sort of brutish and we need to have a civilized out of us Josh what do you think so we need to parse that out first of all what Porsche anything you don't tell me what the powers on my show I'm go ahead you know he's equating religion and race and ethnicity which is you know fundamentally that doesn't make sense and that's what both we all right and the far left there racializing islam duty Gration it raping um I think that religion has to be understood for what it is it's an idea it's an idea that's taught it's either true or untrue and neither beneficial or right or destructive under percent and you know color of your skin you you're born white or you're born black or you're born brown some of us are born white but because we're Sicilian we lay out in the Sun and then we took just like Amanda and I turn to the color of this brick wall you're glowing but I'm going to glow that there is the exception right right so religion is taught race is not taught but ideas associated with race are taught um but I think that there is there's something fundamentally simplistic about what he's saying because I think human beings are predisposed to being attracted to people that look like them I think there's a reason that I'm not sure about that you and I have a similar skin tone and I'm in no way attracted to you we'd have to move on folks yesterday some idiot to face the Lincoln Memorial with the words F law and the left on Twitter thought it said F Islam I don't know where they got that from but you know it does strike me right now is that everybody hates Abraham Lincoln everybody is it that right is attacking Abraham Lincoln the far left is attacking a rambling these anarchists are attacking him Aaron what is the deal why are people being so mean hey babe please waking alone I think that it's what works like I said there's a lot more yosef everett Koop that's always hated Lincoln now they're kind of coming out above what works now with though with the rise yacht right so forth I think with the far left and the anarchist I think I just want ter I think but all those which have a comment they want to tear everything down and lick has always been associated as like so like the one review guy that everybody likes so it's almost like we sure areas to like you know say he's awful stuff and obviously he's not making Frieza slave that's awesome and so he's always like number one or number two a lot of like residential listeners of libraries ranked and it's really yes I forget Obama would make himself number but it's not make himself number one too probably but so but that's my wife why say there's so much hate towards them right now that's interesting and that might well be the case Amanda any thoughts yeah no I don't think I kind of agree with aarón I don't think the Republic Republicans want ownership of President Lincoln I don't think there's hate because I don't I don't associate Republicans with you alright I think that's a different sex so I don't think Republicans are distancing themselves from Abraham Lincoln I see it on the far left is there anything and from be alright sure all right speaking of the all right well I've got to say goodbye to my panel of deplorable we're not going to do a final thought today I'll just give a final sentence it seems to me that there are four people like my guest James Allsop and for other people who are being attracted to some of these alrighty ideas these alrighty personalities online it seems subversive they seem quasi articulate quasi intelligent and it's a it seems fun with all the memes and everything I would just say look past the surface if you scratch these guys below the skin you are not going to find any substance whatsoever they say they defend Western civilization they don't know a thing about Western culture they don't they don't practice this thing that animates Western culture and if you like the rest of us do want to defend Western culture and do want to advance it then read a book man read something about it learn about your own culture and practice the thing that made it so important those values that we see embodied in our United States Constitution and on that I will see you all tomorrow I'm Michael Knowles is the Michael Nolt show come back tomorrow we'll do it again
