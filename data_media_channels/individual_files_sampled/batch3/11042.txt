the US president Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton has arrived right here in Moscow it's where he'll be meeting with the Russian of President Vladimir Putin we can have a front 5 to our tease my dad gasps dear for details on this Murata well one might expect there's a list of issues for the two to discuss here what are your expectations right House said itself that there's a number of reasons outstanding serious issues between Russia and the United States we're talking Syria Ukraine were talking this developing arms race as some call it as well as what the United States calls alleged Russian interfering in the u.s. 2016 elections but the real juice of it is that there's been a lot of talk rumors mostly about a potential meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin face-to-face but look at who's coming john bolton he said to meet with vladimir putin but the character himself speaks volumes john bolton is a hawk he's aggressive when it comes to foreign policy he's real America first everyone else second kind of guy so even if Trump is you know set on improving relations with Russia which are absolute low it's not a fact that john bolton will assist with that Russians have walked all over the Obama administration for eight years it's really been a pathetic performance if you make them feel pain and others feel pain then the possibility of deterring future conduct like this increases that's what we need to do the Kremlin has just said that you know it's it wants to talk to john bolton about the sorry states of russian US relations but there may be more play here than two countries making friends there is europe at stake really because relations between the United States and Europe have tanked after Donald Trump slapped tariffs on European goods that's started something of a trade war then there's Donald Trump's comments about NATO about how you know he isn't satisfied about how things are done that Europe should pay more and if you look at it from another perspective politically this may be about using Russia as a piece as a chess piece in the game between Europe and the United States essentially the United States is saying unless you dance to our strings we're gonna make friends with Russia and that may well scare Europe and it would also explain Donald Trump's recent and highly unexpected comment about bringing Russia back into the g8 I would rather see Russia in the g8 as opposed to the g7 I would say that the g8 is a more meaningful group than the g7 whatever it is that Donald Trump and his administration are playing at whatever it is that you know Europe wants to do the press the press doesn't like it at all British press especially Britain has emerged as something of the leader of the anti-russian faction in in Europe and British press are saying you know this is this is going to cause alarm dismay they're entirely unhappy about any potential meeting between the Russians and and the Americans but John Bolton is expected to meet the press later today we've got whole bunch of questions for him and you know once he gives his answers perhaps we'll have a clearer image of whether this is a bluff or whether they're really interested in improving relations with Russia arty is Murad gasps dear thank you you
