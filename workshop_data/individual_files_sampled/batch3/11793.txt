now Germany could be on course for snap elections after talks on forming a governing coalition collapsed the leader of the pro-business Free Democrats party announced his decision to pull out of negotiations with the Christian Democrats and the Greens the ones we will not abandon our voters for a policy with which we are not convinced it is better not to govern than to govern badly well the German political scene is in disarray on Monday morning following the collapse of these coalition talks there's even some discussion over the future of Angela Merkel ambos just starting as a whisper right now though but following September's election there was two options to form a government either go into a grand coalition with the Social Democrats but that was immediately ruled out by SPD leader Martin Schulz or to form the so-called Jamaica coalition which is a four sided deal between Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union their sister party the Bavarian CSU as well as the environmentalist Green Party and the pro-business Free Democrats it's called the Jamaica coalition because the colors of those parties they make up the flag of the Caribbean island nation however they have broken down who's always looking like there were going to be tense because particularly the greens and the Free Democrats they opposed each other on a number of issues and it seems that's all come to a head with the FB dear leader Christian Linda walking out Angela Merkel says she's quite disappointed and deeply disappointed by the breakdown in these talks it is at least a day of deep reflection on how to go forward in Germany but I will do everything possible as transitional Chancellor to ensure that this country will be well led through this difficult two weeks I regret deeply with all respect to the FDP that we couldn't find a common solution since there's no coalition agreement well there's two options again either frank Valda Steinmeier rubber-stamps Angela Merkel leading a minority government most likely with the Green Party minority government in the Bundestag would result in well a lot of horse trading between different parties and it being very unlikely that any thing would be able to get passed through the through the Parliament or the other option is new elections now this started off as rumblings towards the end of last week with many people saying not a chance on Monday morning though people are now saying new elections may be one of the only options available here in Germany plenty more to come out of this story though on Monday and perhaps or throughout this week I'll be bringing you up to date with all of the latest here in RT as soon as I get it well just now we've learned that Angela Merkel has arrived at the presidential palace to hold negotiations after the failed Jamaica coalition talks the three parties disagreed on a number of issued a key stumbling block was the migrant issue in particular setting limits on the number of asylum seekers allowed in andreen over reunifying refugees with their families we're now joined by a guest to discuss this further member of the German parliament found the alternative for Germany party Hans at York Muller mr. Bhalla thank you for joining us on the program now post-war Germany has always been known as the stable backbone of the EU how has Angela Merkel found herself in such a position now she sacrificed all all her no she has never had any beliefs she sacrificed the beliefs of all the parties mrs. Merkel forced to join into these coalition talks and now we have the outcome a very unstable situation for our country unfortunately Hanz do you think any of Angela Merkel's policies could have got in the way of a compromise deal might possibly in her approach to immigration of benefit over the most important important point of the last night was that in my personal opinion and not only my personal opinion in the opinion of many analysts the Liberal Democrats they only were waiting for some kind of incident to blow up the whole talks so I don't think that this really was question of the migration policy the Liberal Democrats they have their own agenda some kind of hidden agenda and the only abuse I think at some points of the talks to step out do you think this is something that was highly anticipated then so what happens next to understand that Merkel will now have to consult with the president what do you think he will say to her do you think it could be a minority government or could it be something else our president mr. Stoudemire he expressed himself clearly only some some days ago before the weekend he is not fond of having new elections in Germany so that what she said the some days ago so I can only expect him to repeat to mrs. Merkel to find a way to avoid new elections but the question is how this can be done because there is only one opportunity to go back into a big coalition with the Social Democrats who on their own themselves denied in being interested so this situation is very unforeseen and very unstable for shipping whatever does happen next be it a snap election or a minority government just speculation at this point but do you think Merkel's stands any chance of being reelected as Chancellor no I think mrs merkel's time as a not only as a chancellor of germany but also as a political politician is over now and this was expects this press clearly today in the press conference of our fraction leaders of mr. : that mrs. Vidal that this is a personal failure what happened last night is a personal failure of mrs. Merkel and her policy and I'm going to add it's an only the failure of mrs. Merkel it's the failure of the whole political system and yoke mother a member of the German parliament from the alternative for Germany party thank you for your time and apologies for to our viewers for the poor quality of sound there
