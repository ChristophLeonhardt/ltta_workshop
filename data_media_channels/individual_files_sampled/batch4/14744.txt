they just keep on doing it Russia Russia Russia for more than a year and now after some cheesy graphic is released by Vladimir Putin just days before his election we have the accusation that we're coming into a new cold war with Russia well let's just get the facts straight Francis Fukuyama was wrong very wrong the 1990s in the foreign policy national security arena was defined by two articles that came became books one was Francis Fukuyama's the end of history in the last man and the other was Sam Huntington's clash of civilizations let's start with professor Huntington the late professor wrote a book that has been misrepresented and misinterpreted he didn't say the future would be about the clash between different civilizations he said it would happen on the borderlands where these civilizations rubbed up against each other if you look at Kashmir if you look at the Balkans in the 1990s there's a lot to be said for professor Huntington's analysis and I recommended at least the original article that turned into a book but Francis Fukuyama had as great an influence when he said back in the beginning of the 1990s as the Cold War had finished that ideology is irrelevant there will be no more ideological wars we defeated the Nazis we defeated the Soviet Union so now democracy stands alone and the future of humankind is just about tinkering at the edges of market democracy well Francis professor Fukuyama if you prefer how wrong you were ideology is a dead ideology is very very much alive and I'm not just talking about September the 11th but of course that's part and parcel of it in my book defeating jihad the winnable war I draw a direct line between the Nazis of World War two the Communists of the Cold War and the jihadists of today they're all connected their end state may be different in terms of who they worship or what they wish to create but they're all totalitarians they all refused to Brooke compromise if you do not agree with them you will be enslaved or you will be killed whether you're a Jew resisting the Nazis of World War two or whether you're a communist refusenik a dissident during the Cold War like Solzhenitsyn or whether you're just a Christian or a Jew or a Buddhist or a Zoroastrian or a Yazidi who's being exterminated by the global jihadi movement ideology is very much alive even in the Kremlin remember this former KGB colonel who's now the head of state of the Russian Federation has gone on record saying that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geostrategic or geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century that's an ideological statement he wishes Russia to be great again and that's why he's rattling his sabers prior to an election so don't take these things for granted ideas matter at the beginning of the 21st century just as much as they mattered in 1939 1941 or 1948 ideology never left and we as the only nation America founded on the principles of liberty and freedom we are the last best hope thank you for watching the Gawker briefing if you like this video please check out the rebel media YouTube channel follow me on Twitter at said Gawker that's Seb g o RK a and share these videos on Facebook and Twitter because with your help we can push back on the fake news industrial complex and finally get the truth out god bless
