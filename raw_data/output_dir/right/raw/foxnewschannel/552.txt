1
00:00:08,277 --> 00:00:10,546
>> MICHAEL MOORE IS NOW MAKING

2
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:13,082
DISASTER MOVIES, HIS NEW ONE AN

3
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:15,584
EIGHTH PLACE FLOP MAKING ONLY $3

4
00:00:15,584 --> 00:00:16,519
MILLION TOTAL.

5
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:22,091
IT SANK FASTER THAN THE

6
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:22,458
POSEIDON.

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:28,865
DOES THE FLOP MATTER?

8
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:41,077
MEANWHILE, THE COASTAL ELITES

9
00:00:41,077 --> 00:00:44,480
USE MORE -- AS A VIRTUE SIGNAL.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,250
THE FRENCH SAY 2 SAME THING SO

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,952
THE LIE STANDS.

12
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:50,920
MOORE’S FILMS ARE LIKE VITAMIN

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,321
SUPPLEMENTS.

14
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:53,156
MOST OFFER ZERO BENEFIT BUT YOU

15
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:55,225
STILL SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT HIM

16
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:57,727
BUT TO HIS CREDIT, MOORE’S

17
00:00:57,727 --> 00:00:59,763
MOVIES ARE OVERTLY POLITICAL.

18
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:02,632
UNLIKE THE REST OF HOLLYWOOD,

19
00:01:02,632 --> 00:01:04,434
WHERE THEY INJECT POLITICS TO

20
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:05,468
GET STUFF MADE.

21
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:07,037
THEN THERE IS THAT PART ABOUT

22
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:07,604
CLIMATE CHANGE.

23
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:09,272
AT LEAST MOORE WEARS HIS

24
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:10,407
POLITICS ON HIS SLEEVE.

25
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:11,741
GOD KNOWS THERE IS PLENTY OF

26
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:12,109
ROOM.

27
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:13,777
I’M SURE THE MEDIA EXPECTED THE

28
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:15,112
FILM TO OPEN BIG.

29
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:16,646
A REJECTION OF TRUMP AND YOU.

30
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:18,715
IT DIDN’T AND IT WASN’T.

31
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:21,051
THE LESSONS, IDEOLOGY AS

32
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:24,254
ENTERTAINMENT IS AS LOONY AS A

33
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:26,256
COLONOSCOPY FOR RECREATION.

34
00:01:26,256 --> 00:01:28,458
PLUS AMERICA DOESN’T NEED A

35
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,927
LECTURE FROM A RICH DUDE ABOUT

36
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:31,428
HOW BAD THINGS ARE WHEN THINGS

37
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:31,895
ARE GOOD.

38
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:34,498
OUR COUNTRY’S METRICS LOOK GREAT

39
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:36,200
WHICH TURNS MOORE’S CINEMA INTO

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,135
A FAIRY TALE.

41
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:39,403
AS USUAL, WHEN THERE ARE FLOPS

42
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:41,138
THE MEDIA IGNORES IT.

43
00:01:41,138 --> 00:01:42,373
IF IT WAS NUMBER ONE YOU CAN BET

44
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:43,540
HE WOULD BE EVERYWHERE.

45
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,808
THERE IS AN OLD SAYING, YOU

46
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:45,809
DON’T REPORT ON PLANES THAT

47
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:47,511
DON’T CRASH BUT YOU ALSO DON’T

48
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:50,214
REPORT ON YOUR FAVORITE BELIEFS

49
00:01:50,214 --> 00:01:51,015
THAT DO.

50
00:01:51,015 --> 00:01:52,750
YOU KNOW, JUDGE, WE JUST WANTED

51
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,417
TO ESCAPE.

52
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:54,885
WHO GOES TO MOVIES FOR

53
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:58,122
POLITICAL, WOULD YOU GO TO SEE A

54
00:01:58,122 --> 00:01:59,390
POLITICAL MOVIE RIGHT OR LEFT?

55
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,692
>> JUDGE PERINO: I’M DYING TO GO

56
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:02,793
TO A MOVIE.

57
00:02:02,793 --> 00:02:04,328
I’M TRYING TO GET ANYONE TO TAKE

58
00:02:04,328 --> 00:02:05,963
ME TO THE MOVIES.

59
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:09,300
I WOULD GO TO MICHAEL MOORE?

60
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,568
>> YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING,

61
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:11,969
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

62
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:12,870
I DON’T THINK --

63
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,772
>> JUDGE PERINO: YOU AND I

64
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:17,809
COULDN’T AGREE ON A MOVIE.

65
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:23,481
>> I’LL PICK A MOVIE.

66
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:25,550
>> JUDGE PERINO: BEN HUR.

67
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,686
>> SOMETHING IN THIS CENTURY.

68
00:02:28,686 --> 00:02:32,791
>> JUDGE PERINO: "GONE WITH THE

69
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:33,091
WIND"?

70
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:34,559
KENNEDY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE?

71
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:36,728
>> WHAT DO I WANT TO SEE?

72
00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:39,230
GOSH, I LOVE MARVEL MOVIES.

73
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,566
>> YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD YOU LOVE?

74
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:43,835
THE NEW NICHOLAS CAGE MOVIE.

75
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:44,202
MANDY.

76
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:44,970
IT’S FANTASTIC.

77
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,671
>> I HEARD HIS CHARACTER IS

78
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:47,005
UNREAL.

79
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:48,206
BUT IT’S SO FUNNY BECAUSE WE’RE

80
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:51,209
TALKING ABOUT THIS, WE’RE NOT

81
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:52,277
TALKING ABOUT MOORE BECAUSE IT’S

82
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:54,012
NOT ENTERTAINMENT, IT’S NOT HOW

83
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:56,581
PEOPLE CONSUME THAT KIND OF

84
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:56,982
INFORMATION.

85
00:02:56,982 --> 00:03:02,321
EVERYONE HAS GIANT COSTCO TVs,

86
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:06,859
50-INCH PLATINUM TV OR PLASMA,

87
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:07,226
WHATEVER.

88
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:08,861
SOON FOX NATION, YOU’RE ABLE TO

89
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:11,230
WATCH THIS INCREDIBLE CONTENT

90
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,934
AND YOU GO TO MOVIES FOR TOTAL

91
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:16,302
ESCAPISM.

92
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:16,835
THAT’S WHEN YOU --

93
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,037
>> BECAUSE, IN FACT, MICHAEL

94
00:03:18,037 --> 00:03:20,306
MOORE HAD SOME HIT MOVIES THAT

95
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:21,206
WERE ABOUT NEWS.

96
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:25,444
BUT NOW I THINK NEWS IS SO

97
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:25,845
OMNIPRESENT.

98
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:26,745
>> FAKE NEWS.

99
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:29,048
>> SO THE BIG WEEK -- THE BIG

100
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:31,117
MOVIE IN MY FAMILY THIS WEEKEND

101
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:33,319
WAS "THE HOUSE WITH A CLOCK IN

102
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,553
THE WALLS."

103
00:03:34,553 --> 00:03:35,621
>> WAS THAT GOOD?

104
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:37,523
>> I DIDN’T GO, EVER WENT EXCEPT

105
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:38,524
ME BECAUSE I WORKED.

106
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:39,325
>> THEY LIKED IT?

107
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:40,459
>> THEY LOVED IT.

108
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:41,661
THE LITTLE GUYS GOT A LITTLE

109
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:42,795
SCARED BUT THAT’S WHERE PEOPLE

110
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:43,129
WENT.

111
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:45,097
THEY DIDN’T GO TO MICHAEL MOORE

112
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:46,098
BUT I THINK IT’S BECAUSE THE

113
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:47,500
NEWS IS KIND OF ROUGH.

114
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,104
>> YOU NEED ESCAPISM.

115
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:52,038
>> HERE’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

116
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:53,206
THE FIRST AND SECOND.

117
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:55,541
THE FIRST MOVIE WAS BASED ON A

118
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,310
CONSPIRACY THEORY AND THE

119
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,212
AUDIENCE LOVES THAT REMEMBER THE

120
00:03:59,212 --> 00:04:01,314
SAUDI CONNECTION TO THE BUSH

121
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:03,149
FAMILY.

122
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:08,955
DICK CHENEY’S WAR PROPHETEERS.

123
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:13,259
THE CRITICS LOVED IT BECAUSE IT

124
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:13,827
WAS FRESH.

125
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:15,495
THERE IS NO CONSPIRACY WITH

126
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:15,929
DONALD TRUMP.

127
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:17,163
IT’S ALL OUT IN THE OPEN.

128
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:18,130
THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON BEHIND

129
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:18,964
THE SCENES.

130
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:20,266
IF ANYTHING, PEOPLE ARE

131
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:21,801
CONSPIRING AGAINST HIM AND IF

132
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:23,904
YOU WANT ANTI-TRUMP PROPAGANDA,

133
00:04:23,904 --> 00:04:26,740
YOU WATCH CNN OR YOU WATCH

134
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,040
MSNBC.

135
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,175
>> YOU KNOW WHAT’S INTERESTING,

136
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:29,676
AND MICHAEL MOORE WAS ONE OF THE

137
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:30,811
FEW PEOPLE WHO CALLED THE

138
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:32,078
ELECTION AHEAD OF TIME.

139
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:33,780
THERE WERE VERY FEW, SO MANY

140
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,015
PEOPLE, ALL THE POLLSTERS WERE

141
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:37,084
OFF AND HE WAS THE ONE PERSON ON

142
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:39,186
THE LEFT, I KNOW THESE PEOPLE, I

143
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:40,821
KNOW THESE PEOPLE IN MICHIGAN

144
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:46,593
AND THE RUSTBELT AND THEY ARE SO

145
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:47,427
DISENFRANCHISED, WHAT HE’S

146
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:48,195
SAYING RESONATES, AND HE COULD

147
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:49,596
EASILY WIN, AT LEAST THIS PART

148
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:50,831
OF THE COUNTRY AND HE WAS

149
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:51,965
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

150
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:59,106
SO HE MAKES A BETTER ANALYST.

151
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:00,240
>> THEY THOUGHT SOMEBODY ELSE

152
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,942
WAS BENEFITING, NOT THEM.

153
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:03,110
I THINK THAT’S WHAT IT IS.

154
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,880
AND JESSE, BY THE WAY, I JUST,

155
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,182
TO ME, WHEN YOU LOOK AT MICHAEL

156
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,283
MOORE, IT SEEMS TO ME MICHAEL

157
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:10,985
MOORE WAS HITTING SOMETHING THAT

158
00:05:10,985 --> 00:00:00,000
WAS VERY REAL BEFORE, AND YOU
