very beautiful way<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we can see and it</font>

38
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">was also inspired by architecture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">polish palaces you can definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,280
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because what I like about this is</font>

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ceiling it almost makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel</font>

44
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:22,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more about the the architecture</font>

45
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,540
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the rest of Warsaw</font>

46
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,620
these days because this

47
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,239
really beautiful places but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's also</font>

48
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,269
some not so beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> places right</font>

49
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,409
our architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Warsaw is very mixed</font>

50
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:37,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">in styles for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this building is a</font>

51
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,370
typical eclectic building from this time

52
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,319
of late 19th<font color="#E5E5E5"> century early 20th century</font>

53
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">when Poland was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not independent</font>

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,769
after second after<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world war</font>

55
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,819
Poland<font color="#E5E5E5"> became independent and this</font>

56
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:55,170
historical architecture of the center of

57
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,239
Warsaw was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of our heritage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but we</font>

58
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,349
also started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop fast and we</font>

59
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,900
built in a modern way more modern way

60
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it was still quite classical and</font>

61
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">Warsaw were completely destroyed</font>

62
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,049
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the center by Germans</font>

63
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:19,260
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Warsaw Uprising</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

64
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,840
intentionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> destroyed all historical</font>

65
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,480
buildings<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a part of them were rebuilt</font>

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,260
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the war and part of them</font>

67
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:36,359
were destroyed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and communists built a</font>

68
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:39,959
new one<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a modern way from 40s and 50s</font>

69
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:46,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it looks like modern socialism</font>

70
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">socialist building so we have big big</font>

71
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,780
suburbs in Warsaw with blocks of flats

72
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's not nice it's not classical but</font>

73
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:03,720
now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> built a new new new flat so if we</font>

74
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,329
which are much better but<font color="#CCCCCC"> still not</font>

75
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,290
classical so so maybe we will have some

76
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,030
neoclassical buildings but it's not it's

77
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the case now you said something</font>

78
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite funny earlier about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously it</font>

79
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,000
was terrible under Russian rule but

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,500
actually the<font color="#E5E5E5"> buildings under Russian</font>

81
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,418
rule were better than under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the EU rule</font>

82
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,410
right yes unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got some</font>

83
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">money from the EU especially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Polish</font>

84
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,860
universities and they built in

85
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,120
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid way that everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

86
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,340
be modern and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they think it's modern</font>

87
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,530
when it is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to industrial</font>

88
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,990
buildings or<font color="#CCCCCC"> even industrial</font>

89
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,060
technological stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do not have</font>

90
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,600
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> buildings which could look like this</font>

91
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and when we were this part</font>

they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actions were quite</font>

156
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">spectacular because Germans were very</font>

157
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:11,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">strong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you were not smart</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

you did<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing but if you were smart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

159
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:17,039
you were observing Germans in a very

160
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,319
prudent way you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> succeed with some</font>

161
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,719
actions which made Germans very angry

162
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:26,139
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> angry and of course it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very sad</font>

163
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they destroyed all all the city</font>

164
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,409
and killed so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is</font>

165
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,318
hard to count it was hundreds of

166
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:37,059
thousand people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they killed not</font>

167
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,419
only Jews but many<font color="#E5E5E5"> Poles and people of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">different origins</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who lived here in</font>

169
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,839
Warsaw<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we believe in Poland that</font>

170
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's in other countries and people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

171
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,889
focused especially on

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Holocaust and it was of course very</font>

173
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:57,980
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad but people don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

174
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">Germans took Polish people from the</font>

176
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:06,109
them so one thing I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite amazing</font>

177
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:09,049
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this shows that even back then</font>

178
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,059
the young people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were quite savvy they</font>

179
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,559
fought in different ways they were

180
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">underground and they were stopping the</font>

181
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,429
logistics<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these things rather than</font>

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flat-out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> war right and today</font>

whether it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> young footballers or</font>

00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,449
even the rappers who are doing it

through culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> or even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through politics</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">conventional methods yes that's true and</font>

190
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:38,179
what is important to understand that the

191
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:41,089
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Poland</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

192
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:43,669
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> this symbol</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now it is on many</font>

this chapter<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our history as closed</font>

198
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">because for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we as a country</font>

199
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,589
demand reparations from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Germany because</font>

200
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:12,470
Germany<font color="#CCCCCC"> never paid for what they did to</font>

201
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,759
Poland<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were a communist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font>

202
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,589

agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these communists puppets</font>

207
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,249
so now Polish government is putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the international debate that maybe</font>

209
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:38,209
