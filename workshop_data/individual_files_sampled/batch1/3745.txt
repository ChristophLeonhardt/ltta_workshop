we actually lost nuclear weapons in flight we never had one go off that all happened long before I came in the service and they stopped doing it well before I started flying the f-16 we've lost them several several different locations Tampa Florida we've lost them in Georgia we've lost several in swampy areas in South Carolina as well I know we've recovered most of them I don't know that we've recovered all of them we lost them in a sense that they they were pitched out of an airplane and we had to go don't find them there was a movie several years ago with Cuba Gooding jr. in it about the first black deep-sea diver and one of the scenes in it is him in the water looking for a bomb or a missile and that's what they were looking for is one that had been lost out of a b-52 so we learned not to do that a long time ago what we would do is sit in a hangar with alert and that that jet would be fully cocked ready to go at a moment's notice and it would have a live nuclear weapon on board it and we would be ready to go if that that time came it came about
