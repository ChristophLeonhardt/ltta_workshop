US military bases on the Japanese island of Okinawa have long been a source of anger to locals not only over crimes committed by troops but because of significant environmental damage to our now even US veterans are joining the campaign to get them to clean up their act oh yeah Shinda no cannot deny and these ones camouflage so much it's very hard to find out these ones are much easier do US Marines behave like this in their own country or do they just act like this because it's Okinawa I was in Okinawa because we had a delegation there we were supporting the local people and Hanako against the new base that's been created there and I was told that I heard reports that there was trash all over the place so I had to see with my own eyes because that was a Marine that was stationed out there and I couldn't believe it because the Marines when I was in we would never do that we were trained if you pack it in you take it out so so that's why I went up there and it just blew my mind I couldn't believe what I saw all the trash in such a pristine area the claims that the US military is the biggest polluter I definitely agree with that there's a single most polluter in the world and that's not something that it's that it's up for agreement or disagreement this this can be measured ranging from pollutants from the co2 contributions at the US military puts out into the atmosphere the amount of fuel that they use the US doesn't look into the environmental issues or acknowledge them because of one big reason is the cost of reach retribution so if if the United States military is destroying an area areas ecology and not only that also affecting the health of other people there's a huge cost in that well another concerned u.s. veteran who's also been to Okinawa told us he doesn't expect the Pentagon to turn eco-friendly anytime soon I've seen a lot of issues around the bases in Okinawa you know similarities in Iraq and Afghanistan and different bases here on US soil where it's just contaminating the land that it's using there they use open burn pits that is having huge effects on military personnel members and just outright consumption of fossil fuels across the Pentagon of all four branches having a training center in the middle of a rain forest it should ultimately come down to the people who live in or near that rain for us so say take the yawn Bora forests in northern Okinawa where the US Marines have been training for decades the people they are on the ground who lived there and have to suffer from the consequences of that training they don't want it there the u.s. doesn't really cooperate and in any investigations of environmental issues because it's a direct threat to their national security goals but the problem is environmental issues are a direct threat to our lives the u.s. gets away with a lot of environmental issues and it's not just environmental issues they get away with a lot of things that I think if the American public knew what was going on they would demand for it to advert at least stop
