1
00:00:07,265 --> 00:00:09,233
>>> I'M WITH HER JUST DIDN'T

2
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:11,101
MAKE ME FEEL AS A GUY THAT

3
00:00:11,102 --> 00:00:13,304
DIDN'T GET TO SEE MY DAD ALL THE

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,972
TIME LIKE A GUY THAT COULD PLAY

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:15,940
CATCH WITH HIS SON.

6
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:17,141
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT WHEN I

7
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,476
PUT THIS HAT ON, IT MADE ME FEEL

8
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:22,746
LIKE SUPERMAN.

9
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:24,815
THIS HAT, IT GIVES ME POWER IN A

10
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:25,082
WAY.

11
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,450
>> I AM WITH HER.

12
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:27,918
DIDN'T HILLARY CLINTON THINK

13
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:29,553
THAT THAT PHRASE MIGHT ALIENATE

14
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:34,458
A LARGE PART OF THE POM

15
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:34,825
A LARGE PART OF THE POPULATION.

16
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,827
IT TOOK SOMEONE LIKE KANYE WEST

17
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,729
TO PUT A BRIGHT RED HAT ON AND

18
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,097
SAY, HEY, WHAT ABOUT US?

19
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:42,700
HERE HE IS BACK IN AUGUST

20
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,268
EXPLAINING WHY THE MEGAHAT

21
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:46,270
REPRESENTS A LOT MORE THAN JUST

22
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:47,271
SUPPORTING TRUMP.

23
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:51,275
>> IT REPRESENTED OVERCOMING

24
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:55,412
FEAR AND DOING WHAT YOU FELT NO

25
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:59,149
MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAID.

26
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,250
THE HIP-HOP COMMUNITY CAN'T

27
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:00,985
BULLY ME.

28
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:02,820
AT THAT POINT, IF I'M AFRAID TO

29
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:09,460
BE ME, I'M NO LONGER YOU.

30
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:11,962
>> JOINING ME IS HOST OF TUCKER

31
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:14,431
CARLSON AND AUTHOR OF "THE NEW

32
00:01:14,432 --> 00:01:16,433
YORK TIMES" NUMBER ONE BEST

33
00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:19,036
SELLER, "THE SHIP OF FOOLS" THAT

34
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,971
JUST KNOCKED BOB WOODWARD OFF

35
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:22,873
THE NUMBER ONE SPOT ON "THE NEW

36

YORK TIMES" BEST SELLER LIST.

37
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:26,410
TUCKER, FIRST OF ALL, I'M SO

38
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:27,511
HAPPY I KNOW YOU.

39
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:33,384
>> CONGRATULATIONS, THANK YOU,

40
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:33,684
LAURA.

41
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:35,052
>> Laura: WHEN I WAS GOING

42
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,820
THROUGH SOME TOUGH TIMES, YOU

43
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:38,122
WERE ONE OF THE FIRST TO REACH

44
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:38,989
OUT TO ME.

45
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,190
PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW THIS ABOUT

46
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:45,229
TUCK YOUR, YOU ARE A REALLY GOOD

47
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,562
PERSON.

48
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,032
>> WELL, I'M NOT A GOOD PERSON

49
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:51,268
BUT I HAVE DEEP SYMPATHY FOR

50
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:53,037
ANYBODY, INCLUDING KANYE WEST,

51
00:01:53,038 --> 00:01:53,937
WHO I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

52
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:55,639
I FEEL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALL OF

53
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,108
THE SUDDEN GETTING IT FROM

54
00:01:58,109 --> 00:01:58,475
EVERYBODY.

55
00:01:58,476 --> 00:01:59,710
>> I SAW YOUR SHOW LAST NIGHT

56
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:01,979
WHERE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUE

57
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,348
OF FATHERS AND MISSING FATHERS

58
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:07,184
AND ENTIRE SEGMENTS OF AMERICA.

59
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:08,919
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT.

60
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,953
LOOK, HE IS NOT A POLITICAL

61
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:11,288
PERSON.

62
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:13,690
HE IS NOT GOING TO SPEAK IN

63
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:14,324
PUNDIT TERMS.

64
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:15,726
HE IS GOING TO SPEAK THE WAY HE

65
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:16,994
IS GOING TO SPEAK.

66
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:19,329
IT IS NOT MY MUSIC OR MY THING

67
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,264
NOR IS IT YOURS.

68
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,398
THAT WAS AN INTERESTING MOMENT

69
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,067
WHERE HE SAID THE MASCULINE

70
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:25,903
PRESENCE IN A FAMILY IS SO

71
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:26,904
IMPORTANT AND SHE DIDN'T SPEAK

72
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:27,471
TO ME.

73
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:29,106
IT WASN'T BECAUSE SHE WAS A

74
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:29,406
WOMAN.

75
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:31,875
IT WAS BECAUSE OF HOW SHE WAS

76
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:32,643
PORTRAYING HER CAMPAIGN.

77
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:34,311
>> HE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

78
00:02:34,312 --> 00:02:37,848
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS

79
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:38,348
ANTI-MASCULINITY.

80
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:39,349
THEY ARE ANTI-FATHER.

81
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,751
THEY HAVE TO BE.

82
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:41,452
THAT'S THEIR BASE.

83
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,719
THAT IS JUST TRUE.

84
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,154
THEY HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME.

85
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:45,456
NOT EVERYONE IN THE DEMOCRATIC

86
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:49,026
PARTY BUT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE

87
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:49,993
PARTY IS.

88
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:51,128
ASK A LEADING DEMOCRAT.

89
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,197
IT IS REALLY SIMPLE.

90
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:54,531
I HAVE DONE IT.

91
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:56,700
IS IT BETTER, ALL THINGS BEING

92
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,368
EQUAL, IS IT BETTER FOR KIDS TO

93
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:00,104
GROW UP WITH THE DAD AT HOME?

94
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:01,438
THEY WON'T SAY IT, EVEN THOUGH

95
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,206
IT IS TRUE.

96
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:04,575
I GREW UP FOR PART OF MY

97
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,776
CHILDHOOD IN A SINGLE PARENT

98
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:06,076
HOME.

99
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:07,244
IT WAS GREAT.

100
00:03:07,245 --> 00:03:08,412
I AM NOT ATTACKING ANYBODY.

101
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:10,481
IF YOU CAN'T SAY THAT, YOU ARE

102
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:10,781
LYING.

103
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:11,782
EVERYONE KNOWS YOU ARE LYING.

104
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:14,485
HE KIND OF CALLS THEM OUT IN HIS

105
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:15,819
STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS WAY.

106
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,454
WE SHOULD NOT ATTACK HIM FOR

107
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:17,821
THAT.

108
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,423
>> DAVID GERGEN , ONE OF YOUR

109
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,891
CLOSE FRIENDS ON CNN YESTERDAY

110
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:22,259
SAID THE FOLLOWING.

111
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,127
LET'S WATCH.

112
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:24,428
>> IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

113
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:26,130
SOME OF THE MEN IN THIS COUNTRY

114
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:28,031
AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO TRUMP?

115
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:30,200
IS BEING FOR TRUMP MAKE THEM

116
00:03:30,201 --> 00:03:31,268
FEEL MORE MASCULINE?

117
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,070
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

118
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:34,671
BOY, THERE WAS SURE AN OVERTONE

119
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:40,277
OF IT IN THAT SESSION.

120
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:41,578
>> Laura: IN OTHER WORDS, THE

121
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:44,047
TOXIC MASCULINITY, IT IS A

122
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:46,483
BRUTAL TYPE OF BEING MASCULINE

123
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:48,719
TO BE IN LINE WITH TRUMP.

124
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,021
>> DAVIS DOING THE BEST HE CAN.

125
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,290
I AM NOT GOING TO ATTACK HIM.

126
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,024
>> Laura: WHY NOT.

127
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,059
>> I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.

128
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,894
THAT'S REAL.

129
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:59,196
MEN FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T BE MEN

130
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,665
AND THAT'S NOT A TALKING POINT.

131
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,800
I'M NOT A MEN'S MOVEMENT GUY OR

132
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:04,168
WHATEVER.

133
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:08,438
IF YOU HAD A MOVEMENT THAT WAS

134
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,375
AGAINST TOXIC FEMININITY OR

135
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,309
HOMOSEXUALITY, YOU WOULD SAY YOU

136
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,610
ARE ATTACKING PEOPLE FOR WHO

137
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:15,679
THEY ARE, BECAUSE IT IS MEAN AND

138
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,614
IT HURTS KIDS WHEN YOU DO THAT.

139
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:20,083
WE SEND $60,000 A YEAR THAT HAVE

140
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:22,085
ENTIRE DEPARTMENTS DEVOTED FOR

141
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:23,086
ATTACKING MEN FOR BEING MEN.

142
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:29,893
IF YOU HAVE A SON, THIS IS A

143
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,527
HUGE THREAT TO HIM.

144
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:32,196
IF YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER, WHO IS

145
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:33,931
SHE GOING TO MARRY?

146
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:35,699
THESE ARE CENTRAL QUESTIONS.

147
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,433
>> Laura: THE INTEREST THING

148
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:38,268
ABOUT TUCKER'S BOOK, IT IS SUCH

149
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:39,536
A GREAT READ.

150
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:43,140
IN YOUR "SHIP OF FOOLS" IS

151
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:44,441
LINDSEY GRAHAM AND MITCH

152
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:44,841
McCONNELL.

153
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:47,110
BOTH OF THEM WERE CRITICAL TO

154
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:48,078
PUSHING KAVANAUGH OVER.

155
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,646
>> THEY DID A GREAT JOB THIS

156
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:49,947
WEEK.

157
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:51,481
ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES IN FAIRNESS

158
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:53,250
SHOULD BE GRATEFUL TO THEM.

159
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:53,584
I AM.

160
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,851
>> Laura: WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE

161
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,019
WALL YET, TUCKER.

162
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,521
>> WHICH IS NOT A SMALL THING.

163
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:59,556
BY THE WAY, WHEN REPUBLICANS

164
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:00,958
FACE DIFFICULTY IN THE

165
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,159
MID-TERMS, MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE

166
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,394
THE PARTY RAN ON BUILDING A

167
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:06,863
WALL, NOT ON AN ABSTRACT WALL

168
00:05:06,864 --> 00:05:08,432
BUT ON A PHYSICAL WALL AND THEN

169
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,000
THEY SORT OF GIVE THE FINGER TO

170
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:12,169
THEIR VOTERS, WELL, THE WALL IS

171
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,237
KIND OF STUPID.

172
00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:14,638
>> MAYBE IT IS STUPID.

173
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,539
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

174
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,407
IF YOU TELL ME I'M GETTING A

175
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:19,042
PONY FOR CHRISTMAS, YOU BETTER

176
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,311
NOT GIVE ME A BAG OF HAIR.

177
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:24,481
I'M GOING TO BE REALLY

178
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:25,282
DISAPPOINTED.

179
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,984
>> Laura: I GOT A BAG OF HAIR

180
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:27,317
ONCE.

181
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:28,852
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DAILY LIFE.

182
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:29,720
YOU WAKE UP.

183
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:30,921
GIVE ME YOUR TIME.

184
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:33,724
IF YOU HAD TO JUST DROP INTO

185
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:35,025
TUCKER CARLSON'S LIFE, WHEN YOU

186
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:36,727
WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, IT IS

187
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:37,828
APPROXIMATELY WHAT TIME?

188
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:40,264
