Polaris channel called the Polaris Civil
War

Polaris our youtube network and we're
basically set into two teams and we are
going to battle it out to find out who
is the best gaming team thing shit so
something really cool about this
opportunity is that it is sponsored by
for sale University and what Full Sail
University do is they basically do
degrees that can branch out into the
gaming industry so if any of you guys
are possibly thinking of going into the
gaming industry like maybe gaming
development or art or coding or anything
