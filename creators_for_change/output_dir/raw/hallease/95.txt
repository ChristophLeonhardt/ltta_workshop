11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,500
an editor I decided to start this

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,119
journey to learn about myself as a black

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,160
America and how people of the African

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,869
Diaspora have influenced cities states

15
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:33,719
countries and continents I figured it

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,130
would be most bidding to start off in

17
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,680
the city where I stay Austin Texas and

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,320
bring you all along for the ride this is

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,219
where i stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> austin</font>

20
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,180
so yeah that's in a nutshell the video

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,280
pilot episode that I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish</font>

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,330
is based in austin and where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i stayed</font>

23
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,940

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,130
life<font color="#CCCCCC"> and about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the african-american</font>

25
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,290
community there my goal is to eventually

26
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,830
have this show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know span across the</font>

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,710
country and then go global and bringing

28
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,160
you know the African Diaspora and all

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,350
its diversity and its<font color="#E5E5E5"> history and its</font>

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,830
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> i first started shooting content</font>

33
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,860
for it in September of 2015 with the

34
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,240
help of Evelyn from the internets

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,250

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially I've gotten the project</font>

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,910
as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I can get it with sweat equity</font>

40
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,180
alone as you could see I've used the

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,700
equipment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have at my disposal</font>

42
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,070

43
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,320
own skills as a producer and an editor

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,040

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,900
push the project forward but essentially

46
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,200
it's now at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point where it needs</font>

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,600
financial help to become finished it

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,850
