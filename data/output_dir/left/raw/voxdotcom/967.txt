1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,660
"My fellow Americans"

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,680
"At 7 o'clock this evening, eastern time,"

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,180
"I ordered our forces to launch a cruise missile attack"

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,300
"We targeted tanks, military assets that had been choking off towns and cities"

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,200
"It is a part of a strategy."

6
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:22,480
This is the first time President Trump authorized
a “limited strike” on Syria.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,680
"Tonight I ordered a targeted, military strike on the airfield in Syria,

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,460
from where the chemical attack was launched."

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,840
And this, almost exactly a year later, is
the second time.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,520
Both in Syria, both in response to chemical
attacks.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,680
"Precision strikes on targets associated

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,920
with the chemical weapons capabilities

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,320
of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad."

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,820
A limited strike can really be whatever the
President wants it to be, could be an airstrike,

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,600
a plane flies over, hits a building, they
could use ships and shoot missiles,

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,860
again at buildings or other kinds of targets.

17
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,280
It could be simply just dropping a bomb, one big
bomb,

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,570
on one target like we did in Afghanistan

19
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,570
last year.

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,040
If big option is go to war, the small option
is do nothing, there's a lot of space in between.

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,550
A limited strike is a fairly

22
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,180
good in-between option,

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,830
if a President wants
to send a message but not commit vast resources.

24
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,410
It’s low-cost, and relatively low-risk to
american troops and

25
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,890
limited strikes are also relatively low risk
politically: a President can get credit for

26
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,020
taking action, even if that action fails.

27
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,220
Which is likely why the past six U.S. Presidents

28
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,760
have all taken actions that could be defined as limited strikes.

29
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,720
In 1986, Ronald Reagan ordered a one night
bombing raid in Libya

30
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:50,140
“Launched a series of strikes against the headquarters, terrorist facilities

31
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,800
and military assets that support Moammar Gaddafi's subversive activities."

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,000
To punish Moammar Gaddafi for an attack in
Germany.

33
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:05,760
In 1993, George H.W. Bush destroyed an Iraqi
industrial complex to compel Saddam Hussein

34
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,660
to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors.

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,720
"It was quick, it was decisive, and in the words of White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater,

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,390
it was a “mission
accomplished.”

37
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,780
In 1995, Clinton used the limited strike option,
in the hopes that airstrikes in Bosnia would

38
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,920
compel the Serbians to negotiate the end of
the war.

39
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,980
"American pilots will continue to take to the
skies over Bosnia."

40
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,130
And it ended later that year.

41
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:35,200
The presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia,
have reached a peace agreement.

42
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,480
And In 2001, George W. Bush destroyed Iraqi
air defenses to deter them from targeting

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,510
US planes.

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,860
Trump’s first limited strike in April 2017
was intended

45
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,840
"to prevent and deter the spread and use of
deadly chemical weapons."

46
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,350
And his second use of a limited strike, in
April 2018 was to

47
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:03,060
“establish a strong deterrent against the
production, spread, and use of chemical weapons.”

48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,610
So, the first strike… didn’t really work.

49
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,709
And the data confirms this.

50
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,090
After the 2017 strike, Assad continued to
use chemical weapons.

51
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,330
Trump’s limited strike failed to achieve
its publicly stated goal.

52
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,580
So, how often do limited strikes even work?

53
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:28,020
A study by expert Micah Zenko looked at 36
instances of limited strikes, between 1991

54
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,020
and 2009.

55
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,220
He found that only 16 achieved their military
goals; meaning the intended targets were destroyed.

56
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,560
And furthermore, he judged that 25 achieved
“mixed-success” for their political goals

57
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,700
while only 2 were out-right successful on
all counts.

58
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,620
That’s only 6%.

59
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:52,140
In these instances; the strike had a clear,
defined and measurable goal.

60
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,140
My fellow Americans

61
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,120
Take Clinton’s strike in 1993 for example:

62
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,420
Where the goal was to punish the Iraqi government
for attempting to kill George H.W. Bush.

63
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:08,240
There is compelling evidence that there was,
in fact, a plot to assassinate former President Bush.

64
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,260
It was deemed a success because, well, they never
tried it again.

65
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,269
Trump’s first limited strike, on the other
hand, damaged an airfield, but not Assad’s

66
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,418
ability to use chemical weapons.

67
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:22,789
And that airfield was back up and running
the following day.

68
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:27,449
Zenko found that in the cases that did not
achieve full political success; the level

69
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,610
of force used was often incorrectly drawn
up or insufficient to achieve the political

70
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,460
intent.

71
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,280
It’s not that damaging an airfield had no
effect at all on Assad’s regime, it’s

72
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,969
that it didn’t produce the intended effect.

73
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:44,449
If you’re interested in the bigger goal,
that the Assad regime should stop using chemical weapons,

74
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:47,699
then the strikes last year did not
work.

75
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:53,409
The April 2018 strike doubled the force and
did focus on chemical weapons facilities,

76
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:55,949
But it’s unclear what the long term results
will be.

77
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:58,150
Politically, for Trump to use these strikes, because he

78
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,069
looks tough. He has done something, right?

79
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,360
There is an impulse in the United States to "do something",

80
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,669
anytime something bad happens

81
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:06,669
around the world.

82
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:08,720
That’s what limited strikes ultimately are:

83
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,000
a way for the President to do... something.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even if that something is only successful 6% of the time.
