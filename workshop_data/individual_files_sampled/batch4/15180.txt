more anti conservative bias this time from a leading tech giant and Hollywood and the mainstream media push a glaring double standard another smear a vile vile smear against conservatives against Republicans by Google but this time it was noticed and called out by representative Kevin McCarthy the Republican majority leader in the house in a tweet McCarthy said dear Google this is a disgrace he then used an emoji of an arrow pointing down at a graphic but the hashtag stop the bias and what Google did as you can see is in describing the California Republican Party it gave a brief description from Wikipedia and when it got to the section that notes the ideology some of the ideology was conservatism market liberalism fiscal conservatism green conservatism but the first one the first one was Nazism yes Nazism though in Google's search results Nazism is returning the Republican Party now this is the California GOP but I'm sure it's returning other AG Opie's and I'm guessing that's somewhere in the algorithm it's returning the public in National Republican National Committee and Republicans on the whole conservatives on the whole see the left they've always gone on social media and called us Nazis you're Nazis you're Nazis well now now they're allies in big tech seemed to be embedding that into their platform now luckily luckily it was Kevin McCarthy's tweet is the House Majority Leader he's got wide reach and he received about 3600 retweets about 66 hundred likes his engagement people saw this tweet the tweet got play it's on a Drudge Report picked it up he San Jose Mercury News did a story on it and google google is walking it back they're denying it Google is saying quote we regret that vandalism on Wikipedia briefly appeared on our search results this was not the result of a manual change by Google we have systems in place that catch vandalism before it impacts search results but occasionally errors get through now Google according to centers a maker Mercury News beau something we all know and let me read from story it says Google is often accused by conservatives of censoring right-wing expression now they there was a firing of you remember this last year Google engineer James engineer James the more over it was actually earlier this year over a memo arguing that women may be biologically less suited protect jobs now that fuelled right-wing anger against the company because Google internally was allowing this Google uh internally allows bias against conservatives but then they fire somebody for expressing an opinion based on biology and physiology look no matter how misguided it may be I don't know if it's right I don't know if it's wrong I'm not a physiologist I'm a biologist I'm not a psychologist but I know that if somebody into I feel that if somebody inside Google had written a memo white men are not suited for higher level jobs Google would have celebrated them they probably would have given him a grant and told them to go study it further even though Google was founded by two white men by two white men so Donald Trump jr. chimed in that they won't do a damn thing about it more bias against conservatives it's true you know why it's true now look I love to dig in I love facts I don't like to go off half-cocked and say bias bias bias when there's an honest explanation for it yesterday I brought you the story of how Julie Davis of the New York Times was depressed about being called fake news at a trump rally in Nashville Tennessee by a little boy and then she was forced to correct her own fake news after underreporting the crowd at the rally by 80 excuse me normal allergies by 80% right here's how you know that these aren't mistakes here's why I don't believe Google that look Google might be telling the truth my opinion I don't believe that I don't believe Julie Davis of the New York Times any here's why they never have to make corrections because they painted conservatives or Republicans in a good light Google doesn't have to make corrections that it calls Democrats communists they only have to make correct Corrections when they call Republican not Republicans Nazis the New York Times never had to correct a story under estimating the size of a crowd at a Hillary rally well nobody showed it Hillary rally so they would add underestimate it say one person is there but they've never had to correct a story about a liberal the New York Times has never had the correct story about Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders and Maxine Waters or Keith Ellison or Tom Perez or Al Green the list goes Chuck Schumer the list goes on and on Adam Schiff had Lou Danny Davis they never seem to have to print retractions or Corrections about Democrats you don't find Democrats and liberals enraged at these mainstream media outlets for the way they report on Democrats and liberals you don't find Democrats and liberals debunking their stories and calling them fake news you don't find Democrats and liberals in going after sites like Google and Facebook and Twitter for bias against Democrats and liberals you know why because it doesn't happen they don't need to go after them because it doesn't happen these sites are institutionally left as is Hollywood as is the mainstream media now last week this past week we saw the uproar from Roseanne being canceled right I mean it's the number one trending news story rule probably in the world probably in the world Viacom then cancelled all the previous the old Roseanne shows from 30 years ago now Roseanne was immediately in Samara Lee fired for one we if Olbermann was hired back by ESPN and ABC Disney subsidiary and you see Disney of course fired Roseanne Keith Oberman was hired back despite a history of violent a Nazi you think that's coincidence Google calls Republicans Nazis Keith Olbermann calls Republicans Nazis but it's just a coincidence right it's just a big coincidence big coincidence it's just a mistake it's Wikipedia vandalism who in the world would believe that it's it's not that they do it the liberals do it it's a big insult your intelligence and tell you they're not this is really important content it shows
