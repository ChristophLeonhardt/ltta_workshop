welcome back Facebook is under growing pressure to explain how it will protect Americans personal information from people wanting to exploit it for electoral gain a bombshell report over the weekend says that Cambridge analytic a data firm tied to the Trump campaign harvested information from more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission a former contractor turned whistleblower claims of the information was then used to target voters Facebook says that a Cambridge University researcher Alexander Cogan made an app where users voluntarily gave their personal information and then broke the rules by handing those details over to a data firm Cambridge analytic ah the social network has since suspended Cambridge analytic which denies wrongdoing the revelation is triggering calls on Capitol Hill for Facebook to make it clear how it'll prevent future abuse of Americans personal information one of those lawmakers demanding an investigation joins us now Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee thanks for taking your time to talk to us today senator we appreciate it let's talk about Cambridge analytic and why you think there should be an investigation are you are you worried that some of that information may have been used inappropriately during the 2016 election clearly it was used inappropriately the only question is who should be held accountable the FTC has a consent decree involving Facebook that may have been violated and clearly American privacy was violated some major part of those 50 million individuals whose privacy was violated by Facebook and Cambridge analytical I have a claim here and the Judiciary Committee ought to have Mark Zuckerberg and other executives from Facebook and companies in this space testify under oath in public to explain what happened here and who should be held accountable and what new laws may be necessary to protect American consumers in the future senators Klobuchar and Hannity agree with you they want to have hearings have you gotten anywhere with senator Grassley not yet but I'm gonna be seeing him shortly on the floor of the United States Senate we have a vote underway and I think that this issue ought to be bipartisan there is nothing political in the sense of party about violations of privacy and the violation here of American privacy is so profound and widespread going back to 2015 one Facebook knew about it apparently did nothing even now has failed to notify those 50 million people about their information being at risk Cambridge analytical in a very predatory way used it to target voters for the Trump campaign it has links to the Russian state the question also is whether there was some kind of cooperation there so I think there are a number of different strands and swirling facts here that require more in depth just the people who said yes filling out this survey it's all of their friends as well who they were linked to who ended up giving over their information inadvertently 270,000 people voluntarily provided that information but it led to 50 million Facebook users having their information harvested what policies do you think Facebook needs to needs to enact in order to make it a more secure environment for users are you are you saying that people should start logging off that logging off that website or freezing their accounts before they know and there are a number of questions like that one exactly whether people should be taking action to protect themselves which is hard to do if they haven't been notified that their information is out there at risk a failing on the part of Facebook but more fundamentally how do we make sure that the Terms of Service that facebook is now saying justified what they did that the other protections that may exist are strengthened it was clearly a lack of verification and transparency and oversight here in the way that Facebook this massive breach it relied on the promise that this information would be somehow deleted obviously that promise was never kept but Facebook ultimately bears a responsibility here and we as members of Congress have a obligation to make sure that privacy is protected Facebook shares fell precipitously today 6.8% their biggest one-day percentage decline since 2014 what do you think Mark Zuckerberg needs to do to get out in front of this he needs to come before Congress he needs to be very public open transparent about how they failed and clearly there was a failure here and how they're going to do better it's that simple but also complex because the challenges of protecting privacy are complex and difficult and that's why there needs to be an open public explanation before the Judiciary Committee involving Mark Zuckerberg and other executives including Alexander nix of Cambridge analytic a full investigation that will lead to better laws and protections of privacy this issue is so fundamental and Americans need to understand how their privacy the most sensitive information about their finances their medical condition their preferences as to different kinds of culture and food and all the rest of it are at risk
