1
00:00:00,165 --> 00:00:02,768
HUMAN RIGHTS.

2
00:00:02,768 --> 00:00:04,403
I THINK THE COURT CANNOT GIVE AN

3
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:05,270
INDEPENDENT RULING AS LONG AS

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,539
THESE KIND OF STATEMENTS

5
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:09,408
CONTINUE.

6
00:00:09,408 --> 00:00:10,041
>> Shannon: EXECUTIVE SR.

7
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:10,776
COUNSEL AT THE AMERICAN CENTER

8
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:12,010
FOR LAW AND JUSTICE JOINS US TO

9
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,779
TALK ABOUT THIS.

10
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,180
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, I KNOW

11
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,213
YOU HAVE BEEN HEAVILY INVOLVED

12
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:17,215
IN THIS CASE, AND THE MORE I

13
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:19,418
READ ABOUT IT, THE MORE

14
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:21,186
FRUSTRATING IT IS ABOUT

15
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:23,054
WITNESSES, "EVIDENCE" BEING

16
00:00:23,054 --> 00:00:23,755
INTRODUCED.

17
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:25,557
THE LAST THING I READ IS THAT

18
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:26,691
THE DEFENSE MAY NOT BE ALLOWED

19
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:29,161
TO PUT ON WITNESSES OF ITS OWN.

20
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:32,363
WHAT IS HAPPENING OVER THERE?

21
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:35,367
>> IT IS TOTALLY A SHAM TRIAL.

22
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,202
PASTOR BRONSON IS NOT RECEIVING

23
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:38,804
ANY JUSTICE AT ALL.

24
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:40,005
THE SECOND DAY OF TRIAL WAS

25
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:40,772
MONDAY.

26
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:45,243
AT THE END OF 11 HOURS,

27
00:00:45,243 --> 00:00:46,411
MR. HOLABIRD, WHO YOU JUST

28
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:47,212
TOWARDS BECOMING A TURKISH

29
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:50,882
ATTORNEY, TURNED IN A LIST

30
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:52,217
OF WITNESSES, AND THE COURT

31
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:53,418
INFORMED HIM OF ANY OF THE

32
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:54,085
WITNESSES OR SUSPECTS, THEY

33
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:55,854
WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO

34
00:00:55,854 --> 00:00:56,188
TESTIFY.

35
00:00:56,188 --> 00:01:01,593
OF COURSE, THAT IS ALL OF PASTOR

36
00:01:01,593 --> 00:01:03,328
PASTOR -- THEY ARE ALL SUSPECTS.

37
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:05,630
THEY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO

38
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,031
REFUTE THIS.

39
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,199
>> Shannon: THEY SAY THIS IS

40
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:08,567
STRICTLY A LEGAL ISSUE, HE HAS

41
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,502
BEEN ANY NUMBER OF THINGS,

42
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:12,103
TERRORIST, INVOLVED IN A COUP

43
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:14,406
ATTEMPT, TRYING TO SET UP A

44
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:15,774
SEPARATE KURDISH STATE, SAYING

45
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:17,876
THINGS ABOUT ISLAM, IT IS ALL

46
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:19,077
OVER THE PLACE.

47
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:21,546
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IN TURKEY HAS

48
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:23,782
SAID "GIVE A PASTOR, TAKE A

49
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:24,115
PASTOR."

50
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:25,784
THAT APPEARS TO BE A REFERENCE

51
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:28,386
TO THE CLERIC WHO IS NOW HERE IN

52
00:01:28,386 --> 00:01:28,987
THE U.S.

53
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:30,255
THEY ACCUSE THE CLERIC OF ALSO

54
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:31,556
BEING INVOLVED WITH AN ATTEMPTED

55
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:33,024
COUP WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF

56
00:01:33,024 --> 00:01:33,325
YEARS.

57
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:34,993
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE IS BEING USED

58
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:36,228
FOR POLITICS AT THIS POINT.

59
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:38,563
IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY TO READ

60
00:01:38,563 --> 00:01:39,397
THIS CASE?

61
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:39,998
>> ABSOLUTELY.

62
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:43,602
FROM THE BEGINNING, ON

63
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:44,603
OCTOBER 7TH, 2016, WOULDN'T

64
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:47,706
PASTOR BRUNSON WAS ARRESTED, WE

65
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:50,442
KNEW THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY

66
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:54,813
SOME POLITICAL PLAN ON THIS, AND

67
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,147
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN HAS NOW TWICE

68
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:59,784
PUBLICLY DEMANDED A SWAP OF THE

69
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:01,953
TWO, THE CLERIC IN PENNSYLVANIA,

70
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:02,487
FOR PASTOR BRUNSON.

71
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:04,523
PASTOR BRUNSON HAS BEEN USED AS

72
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:05,390
A BARGAINING CHIP AND A

73
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,792
POLITICAL PAWN.

74
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:08,592
HE'S INNOCENT UNITED STATES

75
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:10,095
AMERICAN CITIZEN WHO IS BEING

76
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:11,196
HELD HOSTAGE IN TURKEY IN

77
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:11,563
TURKEY.

78
00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:13,265
>> Shannon: NOT LONG AGO, WE

79
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:14,666
HAD TWO CENTERS ON THE SHOW WORK

80
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:15,367
ON THIS CASE.

81
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,435
DEMOCRAT JEANNE SHAHEEN AND

82
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:19,170
REPUBLICAN JAMES LANKFORD, WHO

83
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,372
ARE BOTH WORKING ON THIS.

84
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:21,373
TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A

85
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:23,341
SANCTIONS PACKAGE.

86
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:24,776
THIS IS WHAT SENATOR SHAHEEN HAD

87
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:27,178
TO SAY WHEN SHE WAS WITH US.

88
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:29,214
>> PASTOR BRUNSON IS BEING HELD

89
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:29,548
HOSTAGE.

90
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:32,150
I THINK IT GOES ALL THE WAY TO

91
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,586
THE TOP, TO ERDOGAN,

92
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:35,387
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN.

93
00:02:35,387 --> 00:02:36,788
HE'S THE ONE RESPONSIBLE.

94
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:39,257
THESE ARE TOTALLY MADE UP

95
00:02:39,257 --> 00:02:40,559
CHARGES.

96
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:41,293
THEY DON'T EVEN CONNECT PASTOR

97
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:44,195
BRUNSON WITH HIS CHURCH, THEY

98
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:45,997
CALLED HIM A MORMON, DON'T SEEM

99
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:47,566
TO KNOW WHO HE REPRESENTS.

100
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:48,967
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN IN

101
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,736
TURKEY FOR 23 YEARS.

102
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:53,238
AT HIS TRIAL WHEN HE WAS ASKED

103
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:58,376
ABOUT THE CHARGES, HE SAID, I

104
00:02:58,376 --> 00:02:59,077
LOVE TURKEY, I WOULD NEVER DO

105
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:00,478
ANYTHING AGAINST TURKISH PEOPLE.

106
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:02,781
THIS IS NOT FAIR.

107
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:03,448
>> Shannon: WE HAVE HAD AN

108
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:05,584
ABBASID OR THEY ARE ON THE

109
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:07,586
GROUND, OTHER LAWMAKERS, THE

110
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:08,353
PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT NOW

111
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:10,589
WEIGHING IN ON THIS.

112
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:11,590
TURKEY IS A NATO ALLY.

113
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,759
HOW DO WE GET THIS GUY HOME?

114
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,194
>> WE HAVE TO UP THE PRESSURE.

115
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:22,701
WE HAVE SEEN THAT WE HELD THE

116
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:23,301
LINE WITH BOTH KOREA AND

117
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:23,935
AMAZINGLY, NORTH KOREA HAS

118
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:24,736
RETURNED THREE PRISONERS.

119
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:26,438
WE HAVE TO DO THE SAME, EVEN

120
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:28,740
THOUGH TURKEY IS A NATO ALLY,

121
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,542
THEY ARE NOT RESPONDING TO

122
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:31,242
SPECIFIC DEMANDS FROM THE

123
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:32,744
PRESIDENT HIMSELF.

124
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:34,346
I THINK WE HAVE TO DO SANCTIONS,

125
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:35,880
WE HAVE TO HOLD THE LINE AND WE

126
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,916
HAVE TO LET TURKEY KNOW THAT IF

127
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,184
THEY ARE GOING TO ACT LIKE AN

128
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:42,554
ENEMY BY CONTINUING TO HOLD

129
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:44,155
PASTOR BRUNSON, WE HAVE TO

130
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:46,157
TERRORIST READING THAT MIKE ONE.

131
00:03:46,157 --> 00:03:46,858
>> Shannon: I KNOW THIS CAME

132
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:49,961
AS A BLOW TO HIS FAMILY,

133
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:51,162
FRIENDS, LOVED ONES, FINDING OUT

134
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:52,397
THEY WERE SHUTTING THE STONE

135
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:52,697
AGAIN.

136
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:55,367
HE'S BEEN HELD FOR A LONG TIME.

137
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:56,968
IN THE MEANTIME, THE PRESIDENT

138
00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:58,403
HAS HAD GOOD SUCCESS, THE

139
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:00,905
PRESIDENT GETTING PEOPLE FROM

140
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:02,374
DANGEROUS AREAS WHERE THEY WERE

141
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:03,742
BEING HELD AGAINST HIS WILL.

142
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:06,544
HE IS CONTINUING TO INTERVENE,

143
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:06,945
AS YOU ARE.

144
00:04:06,945 --> 00:00:00,000
CECE HEIL, PLEASE KEEP US
