â™ª

2
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:06,731
>> THEY HAVE DESTROYED A

3
00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:07,431
MAN'S REPUTATION, AND THEY

4
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:08,499
WANT TO DESTROY IT EVEN

5
00:00:08,499 --> 00:00:08,800
MORE.

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,201
AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING

7
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:11,135
TO SEE THAT IN THE MID

8
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:11,602
TERMS.

9
00:00:11,602 --> 00:00:13,237
IF WE BROUGHT GEORGE

11
00:00:14,772 --> 00:00:16,239
WE HAVE GEORGE WASHINGTON,

12
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,208
THE DEMOCRATS WOULD VOTE

13
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,843
AGAINST HIM.

14
00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:20,378
36 YEARS, THERE'S NO CHARGE.

15
00:00:20,378 --> 00:00:22,013
ALL OF A SUDDEN THE HEARINGS

16
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:24,282

17
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:25,983

22
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:33,791
THIS IS JUST A GAME THAT

23
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,959
THEY'RE PLAYING.

24
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,594
IT'S A CON GAME.

25
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:38,896
IT'S AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

26
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:40,565
STEVE: IT IS AT THE HIGHEST

27
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:40,898

28
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:42,967
WHAT HAPPENS TODAY DOWN IN

29
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:44,569
WASHINGTON WILL EFFECTIVELY

30
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:45,403
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT

31
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:47,205
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS THE NEXT

32
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:49,607
JUSTICE TO SIT ON THE U.S.

33
00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:50,241

00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:57,115
11TH HOUR.

40
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:58,683
WE HAVE GOT TWO GUYS WHO

41
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,984
CAME OUT TO THE SENATE

42
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:01,653
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND THEY

43
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:03,188
SAID WE THINK SHE IS

44
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,388
MISTAKEN BECAUSE WE WOULD

45
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:07,826
LIKE TO SAY WE ASSAULTED

46
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:08,827
HER, WHICH, YOU KNOW, WE

47
00:01:08,827 --> 00:01:09,961
HADN'T HEARD THAT UNTIL THIS

48
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,295
MORNING.

49
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:13,131
WHAT'S YOUR HEADLINE FROM

50
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:15,233
THIS VERY BUSY THURSDAY

51
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:15,567
MORNING?

52
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:18,670
>> THAT BOTH DOCTOR FORD AND

53
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,270
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL BE

54
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,605
HEARD TODAY UNDER OATH AND

55
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:23,341
THAT THEY MAY BOTH BE RIGHT.

56
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:24,843
THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING VERY

57
00:01:24,843 --> 00:01:26,911
AWFUL HAPPEN TO HER WHEN SHE

58
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,579
WAS 15 AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH

59
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:29,080
WAS NOT THERE AND WAS NOT

60
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,048
INVOLVED WHATSOEVER.

61
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,249
THAT REALLY DOES GO TO

62
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:31,649
CREDIBILITY.

63
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:33,251
THEY COULD BOTH BE CORRECT.

64
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:34,986
BUT I THINK THERE IS SO MUCH

65
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:35,887
BEEN SAID AND WRITTEN AND

66
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,622
DONE WITH RESPECT TO FORD

67
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:38,857
AND KAVANAUGH, THAT I WANT

68
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:41,326

00:01:41,326 --> 00:01:42,193

JUDGE JURY AND EXECUTIONERS,

71
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:45,330
THOSE WOULD BE THE DEMOCRATS

72
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,297
ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY

73
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:47,065

KAVANAUGH ALREADY PUT ON

77
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,171
SUCH SPECTACLE AND CIRCUS

78
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:54,439
LONG BEFORE WE HAD A

79
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,173
CONVERSATION, LONG BEFORE

80
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:56,508
THE COUNTRY KNEW WHO

81
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:58,210

COSBY AND GOING TO JAIL FOR

87
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,890
BEING A SEXUAL PREDATOR FOR

88
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,691
ASSAULTING SOMEONE

89
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:13,091
CRIMINALLY.

90
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,893
THREE OF THEM VOTING TO

91
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:16,761
REFUSE TO MOVE BILL CLINTON

92
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,829
FROM OFFICE FOR HAVING SEX

93
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,631
WITH AN INTERN RIGHT BEHIND

94
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:20,732

00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:22,167
I WANT EVERYBODY TO SEE WHAT

96
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,635
THIS IS ABOUT TO THEM.

97
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,770
THIS IS HYPER PARTISANSHIP,

98
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,806
HOTTIE, HYPOCRITICAL HAPLESS

99
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:28,673
DEMOCRATS ON THE SENATE

100
00:02:28,673 --> 00:02:29,474
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHO IS

101
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:31,043
THE PRESIDENT IS ABSOLUTELY

102
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:32,110
RIGHT HERE TO DESTROY A MAN.

103
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,645
THEY ARE MAD THAT THE SWING

104
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:35,147
VOTE ON THE UNITED STATES

105
00:02:35,147 --> 00:02:37,816
SUPREME COURT COULD BE TAKEN

106
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:39,818
OVER BY A DONALD TRUMP

107
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:40,685
APPOINTEE TO THE SUPREME

108
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:40,986

109
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:42,154
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

110
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:43,155
AND I WOULD HAVE MORE

111
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:44,423
RESPECT FOR THEM IF THEY

112
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:45,857
SAID I DON'T LIKE THE WAY HE

113
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:48,427

00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:50,562

THIS.

116
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:52,030
BECAUSE THEY HAVE RUINED --

117
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,765
THEY HAVE RUINED A COUPLE OF

118
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:54,533
LIVES HERE BY SITTING ON

119
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:55,434
THIS INFORMATION.

120
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:56,702
THIS WOMAN DIDN'T WANT TO

121
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:57,202
COME FORWARD.

122
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:58,237
THEY SMOKED HER OUT.

123
00:02:58,237 --> 00:02:59,371
THEY LEAKED HER IDENTITY.

124
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:00,973
BUT FOR THE REPUBLICANS ON

125
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,474
THE SENATE JUDICIARY

126
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,809
COMMITTEE IN THE MAJORITY,

127
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,143
DR. FORD MAY NEVER HAVE EVEN

128
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,379
HAD TODAY TO TESTIFY.

129
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,080
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD

130
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,681
BE HEARD FROM BEFORE.

131
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:11,350
SO EVERYBODY SHOULD BE

132
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,150
WATCHING THEM.

133
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,819
THEY ARE NOT UNDER OATH

134
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,119
TODAY.

135
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:14,853
I WOULD LIKE TO PUT THE

136
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:16,221
SENATORS UNDER OATH NOT JUST

137
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:18,824
THE TESTIFIERS.

138
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:19,525
BRIAN: TRUE OR FALSE BEHIND

00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:21,126
THE DISEENS YOU WOULD BE

140
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:22,427
BEHIND THE SCENES AS MUCH AS

141
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:22,861
ANYBODY.

142
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:24,363
UPSET WITH REPUBLICANS FOR

143
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:25,464
NOT BEING STRONGER FOR

144
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:26,331
DRAGGING THIS OUT.

145
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,633
BECAUSE HE DRAGGED IT OUT

146
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:28,567
ALL THESE OTHER ALLEGATIONS

147
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:30,302
HAVE COME OUT.

148
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:32,738
HAS THAT CORRECTLY

149
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:33,839
CHARACTERIZING THE

150
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,506
PRESIDENT'S DEMEANOR?

151
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,407
>> FROM THE BEGINNING WE

152
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:37,076
HAVE SAID THAT THIS IS THE

153
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:39,845
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S

154
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:40,179
PROCESS.

155
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,447
THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT

156
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:43,582
WORKS BEST.

157
00:03:43,582 --> 00:03:44,650
THEY HAVE GONE OVER AND

158
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,585
ABOVE TO ACCOMMODATE

159
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:46,952
DR. FORD.

160
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:50,556
SHE HAD A LAUNDRY LIST OF

161
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:51,190
DEMANDS INCLUDING FOR THE

162
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,691
FIRST TIME IN AMERICAN

163
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,692
JURISPRUDENCE BEING THE

164
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,060
ACCUSER BUT GOING SECOND.

165
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,028
WHAT IS JUDGE KAVANAUGH

166
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,030
SUPPOSED TO RESPOND TO?

167
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,065
A "THE WASHINGTON POST"

168
00:03:59,065 --> 00:03:59,665
REPORT?

169
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:01,334
MEDIA RUMORS INSTEAD OF

170
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:02,034
SWORN TESTIMONY THAT SHE

171
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:02,969
WOULD GIVE RESPOND TO?

172
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:04,537
THEY HAVE ACCOMMODATED HER

173
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,172

174
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:07,273
11 DAYS NOW.

175
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:10,009
AND I THINK THAT MY BOSS

176
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:15,748
MOVES AT A PACE THAT MOST

177
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:19,218
PEOPLE ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED

178
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:19,885

179
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,553
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN

180
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,356
TREATED VERY FAIRLY BY THE

181
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:23,689

00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:29,128
ACCUSATION AS HE HAS

186
00:04:29,128 --> 00:04:29,795
CHARACTERIZED IT AFTER

187
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:30,763
HEARING THIS WOMAN'S

188
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:31,864

189
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:34,467
THE VERY SAME DAY, HE WENT

191
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:37,470
THE COMMITTEE BY PHONE.

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,872
SO HE HAS BEEN WILLING,

193
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:41,407
UNDER PENALTY OF EITHER

194
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:42,408
PERJURY OR LYING TO

195
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:43,209
CONGRESS, HE HAS BEEN

196
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:45,044
WILLING, AGAIN AND AGAIN, TO

197
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:46,312
TESTIFY, SO HE HAS BEEN

198
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:47,613
WAITING FOR 11 DAYS.

199
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:48,848
WE KNOW WHAT BOTH OF THEM

200
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:50,550
ARE GOING TO SAY.

201
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,452
THEIR STATEMENTS ARE ALL FOR

202
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:52,985
THE PUBLIC TO SEE.

203
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:55,288
I THINK THE PROCESS HAS BEEN

204
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:56,722
VERY ACCOMMODATING FOR VERY

205
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:57,657
UNIQUE AND UNUSUAL

206
00:04:57,657 --> 00:04:58,891
SITUATION.

207
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,960
BUT, EVERYTHING THAT THE

208
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,595
LEFT HAS SAID THAT THEY ARE

209
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:03,863
CONCERNED IN HERE, GETTING

210
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:06,699
TO THE TRUTH, HAVING HER BE

211
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,234
HEARD, NOT HAVING HER BE

212
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:09,068
IGNORED AND INSULTED.

213
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:11,471
I'M THE ONE WHO 10 DAYS AGO

214
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:12,672
SAID DON'T INSULT HER AND

215
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:14,240
DON'T IGNORE HER.

216
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,308
HERE 10 DAYS LATER THEY ARE

217
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:16,109
GOING TO TESTIFY.

218
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:17,443
THE FACT THAT THIS MORNING

219
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:18,845
THE "U.S.A. TODAY" CAME OUT

220
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:20,580
WITH THE SWORN TESTIMONY OR

221
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,215
THE INTERVIEWS BY SOME IN

222
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:23,383
THE SENATE WITH THESE TWO

223
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:25,084
MEN WHO SAY IT WAS THEM,

224
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:31,758
THEY WERE THERE AND THEY HAD

225
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:33,793
SEXUAL CONTACT OR OEA

226
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:34,160
ASSAULTED.

227
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,861
I DIDN'T READ EVERYTHING SO

228
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:36,229
I WANT TO BE CAREFUL HERE.

229
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:36,829
THAT'S BIG NEWS.

230
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:38,898
THE OTHER THING IS FOR THESE

231
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:40,233
GANG RAPE ALLEGATIONS, I

232
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:42,602
WOULD TELL THAT WOMAN GO

233
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:45,038
MARCH DOWN TO THE MONTGOMERY

234
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:46,873
COUNTY COURTHOUSE TODAY AND

235
00:05:46,873 --> 00:05:47,774
FILE YOUR CLAIM.

236
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:49,108
BECAUSE, AS I UNDERSTAND IT

237
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:50,043
AS A FULLY RECOVERED

238
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:51,311
ATTORNEY OF MANY YEARS, SEX

239
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:52,979
CRIMES HAVE NO STATUTE OF

240
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,147
LIMITATIONS IN MARYLAND.

241
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:58,985
SO, WHY IS SHE NOT WHY

242
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:00,353
DIDN'T SHE YEARS AGO OR WHY

243
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:02,322
ISN'T SHE EVEN NOW TRYING TO

244
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:03,523
GET THAT PROSECUTED THERE.

245
00:06:03,523 --> 00:06:04,858
IS IT BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A

246
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:06,459
LOT OF EVIDENCE OF THAT?

247
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,861
WE CAN'T JUST HAVE A TRIAL

248
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:14,834
BY TV ON TV AND THROUGH THE

249
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,036
PRESS THEY TRY TO DO THAT

250
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:17,103
AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH SOME

251
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:17,437
PEOPLE.

252
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:18,204
IT WON'T HAPPEN HERE.

253
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:19,239
BRETT KAVANAUGH WILL RAISE

254
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,473
HIS RIGHT HAND AS HE HAS

255
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:22,142
SOME TIMES THROUGHOUT HIS

256
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:23,743
ADULT LIFE SWEARING AN OATH

257
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,444
TO THE CONSTITUTION WHEN HE

258
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:25,512
WAS SWORN IN AS ASSISTANT TO

259
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:26,479
THE PRESIDENT HERE IN THE

260
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:26,880
WHITE HOUSE.

261
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,114
AS HE WAS SWORN IN TO THE

262
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:30,550
SECOND HIGHEST COURT, THE

263
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,151
D.C. CIRCUIT.

264
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:32,152
PLEDGING AN OATH TO THE

265
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:32,986
CONSTITUTION TO BE HONEST.

266
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:35,088
HE WILL DO THAT AGAIN TODAY,

267
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:36,489
SWEARING TO TELL THE TRUTH,

268
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:37,891
THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING

269
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:38,692
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.

270
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:40,827
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

271
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:41,528
INCLUDING THE DEMOCRATS ON

272
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:43,063
IT WHO SAID THEY WOULD VOTE

273
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:45,098
AGAINST THIS MAN LONG BEFORE

274
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:46,366
KNOWING WHO THESE ACCUSERS

275
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:46,633
ARE.

276
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:47,634
THEY SHOULD ALSO TELL THE

277
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:47,934
TRUTH.

278
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:49,035
THEY SHOULD TELL THE TRUTH

279
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:51,271
IN THEIR SO-CALLED PURSUIT

280
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:53,139
OF THE TRUTH.

281
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:53,807
AINSLEY: KELLYANNE, EVEN IF

282
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:55,609
HE IS INNOCENT, IT'S A

283
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:56,843
SHAME -- IF HE IS INNOCENT,

284
00:06:56,843 --> 00:06:57,778
IT'S A SHAME THAT HIS

285
00:06:57,778 --> 00:06:58,712
REPUTATION IS TAINTED.

286
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:00,213
BUT I'M HEARING NOW FROM

287
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,249
JUST CONVERSATIONS, WHEN YOU

288
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:03,583
HAVE CONVERSATIONS AT THE

289
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,519
DINNER TABLE OR GET IN A

00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,420
TAXI AND NEW YORK AND PEOPLE

291
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,254
ARE TALKING ABOUT, THIS

292
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:08,055
THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS

293
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:09,222
HAPPENING ALL OVER THE

294
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:10,223
COUNTRY, ARE PEOPLE NOW

295
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:11,191
GOING TO THE PRESIDENT OR IS

296
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:12,192
THE PRESIDENT NOW TELLING

297
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:14,261
YOU THAT HE IS CONSIDERING

298
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:16,763
NOMINATING SOMEONE ELSE?

299
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:18,265
NO MATTER WHAT IF HE IS

300
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:18,632
INNOCENT?

301
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:19,833
HIS REPUTATION IS STILL

302
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:20,267
TAINTED.

303
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:21,335
PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY MADE UP

304
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:22,236
THEIR MINDS.

305
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:23,170
YOU HAVE A LOFT DEMOCRATS

306
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,904
ALREADY SAYING THEY BELIEVE

307
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:25,239
THESE WOMEN ARE TELLING THE

308
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:25,706
TRUTH.

309
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:27,674
LET'S SAY HE IS UP FOR A

310
00:07:27,674 --> 00:07:28,342
VOTE OR FRIDAY.

311
00:07:28,342 --> 00:07:29,576
HE DOESN'T MAKE IT THROUGH.

312
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:30,077
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

313
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:31,378
IS THE PRESIDENT TELLING YOU

314
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:33,113
HE IS GOING TO NOMINATE

315
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:34,448
SOMEONE ELSE BEFORE THE MID

316
00:07:34,448 --> 00:07:34,748
TERMS?

317
00:07:34,748 --> 00:07:37,084
>> I'M SORRY, AINSLEY,

318
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:38,151
THAT'S A COMPLETE HILL AT

319
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:38,719
THIS POINT BECAUSE THE

320
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:39,586
PRESIDENT IS STANDING BY

321
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:40,120
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

322
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,954
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

323
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:42,523
RECEIVE THESE TESTIMONIES

324
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:44,491
TODAY FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD

325
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:44,825
TO SEE.

326
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:46,794
AND THEN AS I READ IT THE

327
00:07:46,794 --> 00:07:47,494
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

328
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:51,598
WILL HAVE A VOTE AND IF WHEN

329
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:52,599
JUDGE KAVANAUGH MAKES IT OUT

330
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:53,801
OF COMMITTEE, I GUESS WHEN

331
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:55,135
THEY SCHEDULE THE NEXT VOTE

332
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,304
THROUGH THE WEEKEND OR NEXT

333
00:07:57,304 --> 00:07:57,972
WEEK WHEN THE SUPREME COURT

334
00:07:57,972 --> 00:08:01,542
SITS FOR ITS NEXT TERM THEN

335
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:02,643
WE WILL KNOW WHETHER JUDGE

336
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:04,244
KAVANAUGH HAS ENOUGH VOTE TO

337
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:05,813
MAKE IT TO THE COURT.

338
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:06,246
STEVE: SURE.

339
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:08,449
>> BEFORE THAT EVERYTHING IS

340
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:08,849
SPECULATION.

341
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:09,783
HONESTLY IT PLAYS INTO THE

342
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:10,718
MEDIA GAME.

343
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:12,586
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA GAME OF

344
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:13,620
PALACE INTRIGUE AND

345
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,588
PERSONNEL AND PERSONALITIES

346
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:17,124
INSTEAD OF PRINCIPLES.

347
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:18,058
YOU HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP IN

348
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:19,660
HIS OWN WORDS, IN HIS OWN

349
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,861
VOICE LAST NIGHT SAY THAT

350
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:22,430
THIS IS A SHAM AND A SHAME.

351
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,065
AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO A

352
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:25,466
MAN AND HIS WIFE AND HIS

353
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:26,934
CHILDREN.

354
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:28,235
AND LET ME JUST MAKE VERY

355
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:28,536
CLEAR.

356
00:08:28,536 --> 00:08:29,170
BRETT KAVANAUGH LIVES IN

357
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,006
THIS AREA, JUDGE NEIL

358
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:33,006
GORSUCH CAME FROM COLORADO.

359
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:34,909
WE ALL LIVE IN THIS AREA.

360
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,477
I KNOW CURRENT GEORGETOWN

361
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:37,311
PREP STUDENTS AND PARENTS.

362
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:38,980
WE ALL TALK TO EACH OTHER.

363
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,246
WE ARE ALL POLITICALLY

364
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:40,614
DIFFERENT.

365
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:41,782
WE ARE ALL VERY DIFFERENT.

366
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:44,819
BUT WE ARE ALL -- WE ARE

367
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:45,486
ALL -- MAINSTREAM MEDIA WHO

368
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:47,121
LIVES HERE THINK THEY CAN

369
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:48,289
RUN INTO BRETT KAVANAUGH AND

370
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:49,323
ASHLEY KAVANAUGH AND THOSE

371
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:51,592

GROCERY STORE, THE COFFEE

373
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:52,893
SHOP.

374
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:54,161
AND THEY CAN LIVE WITH

375
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:55,363
THEMSELVES THE WAY THEY HAVE

376
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:56,564
TREATED HIM.

377
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:57,398
JUST HIM, DON'T TALK ABOUT

378
00:08:57,398 --> 00:08:58,966
THE ACCUSERS FOR A MOVEMENT

379
00:08:58,966 --> 00:08:59,867
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE

380
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:00,201
PROCESS.

381
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:01,435
AND DON'T TALK ABOUT THE

382
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:02,136
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE

383
00:09:02,136 --> 00:09:02,870
SUPREME COURT, HAVE YOU SEEN

384
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,940
SOME OF THESE SENATORS?

385
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,875
FOLKS KEEP ON ELECTING THEM.

386
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:08,810
THEY EFFECTIVELY HAVE

387
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,711
LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS TO THE

388
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:10,278
UNITED STATES SENATE.

389
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:11,412
IF THEY CAN LIVE WITH

390
00:09:11,412 --> 00:09:12,413
THEMSELVES THE WAY THEY HAVE

391
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:13,748
TREATED A HUMAN BEING AND

392
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:14,716
THEY CAN LOOK THEIR KIDS IN

393
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:17,185
THE EYE AND SAY I WOULD -- I

394
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:18,986
TREATED HIM AS A HUMAN BEING

395
00:09:18,986 --> 00:09:20,288
THE WAY I WOULD WANTS YOU TO

396
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:21,756
BE TREATED, I WOULD REALLY

397
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:23,725
LIKE THAT -- I KNOW YOU SEE

398
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:25,560
ME OUT HERE AS COUNSELOR TO

399
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,628
THE PRESIDENT ON TV OFTEN,

400
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:28,930
DOING LOTS OF THINGS INSIDE,

401
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:29,931
BY THE PRESIDENT'S SIDE FOR

402
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:30,932
OVER TWO AND A HALF YEARS

403
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:31,199
NOW.

404
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,834
I'M ALSO THE MOTHER OF FOUR

405
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,269
SCHOOL AGED SCHOOL CHILDREN

406
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,169
INCLUDING AN ALMOST

407
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:35,803
14-YEAR-OLD SON.

408
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:37,438
THE CONVERSATIONS BEING HAD

409
00:09:37,438 --> 00:09:38,873
IN THE SUBURBS AMONG WOMEN

410
00:09:38,873 --> 00:09:40,341
ARE NOT JUST ABOUT THOSE

411
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:40,708
ACCUSERS.

412
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,743
IT'S ABOUT THE ACCUSED.

413
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:43,645
AND THE IMPLICATIONS THIS

414
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:44,979
CAN HAVE TO ALL THE BOYS AND

415
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:47,115
MEN IN OUR LIVES.

416
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:47,815
STEVE: SURE.

417
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:48,316
KELLYANNE, YOU ARE

418
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:48,850
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

419
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,251
WASHINGTON IS A SMALL TOWN.

420
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,452
YOU BUMP INTO PEOPLE

421
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:51,853
EVERYWHERE.

422
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:52,687
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT

423
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:53,888
THE PRESIDENT SAID YESTERDAY

424
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:54,822
AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE.

425
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:55,924
AND HE WAS VERY CLEAR.

426
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:57,659
IS HE STANDING BEHIND BRETT

427
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:58,026
KAVANAUGH.

428
00:09:58,026 --> 00:09:59,327
AT THE SAME TIME HE WANTS TO

429
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:00,929
HEAR DR. FORD AND HER

430
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:01,296
TESTIMONY.

431
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:02,597
BUT A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF

432
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:04,499
THE PRESS WERE ASKING WHY

433
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,634
ARE YOU SO SKEPTICAL,

434
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:07,735
MR. PRESIDENT, ABOUT THE

435
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:09,237
STORIES OF THESE ACCUSERS?

436
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:11,739
AND HE SAID, LOOK, I HAVE

437
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:13,174
BEEN ACCUSED FALSELY, HE

438
00:10:13,174 --> 00:10:14,075
SAYS, MANY, MANY TIMES.

439
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:17,145
SO I KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT

440
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:17,445
FEELS.

441
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:18,346
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.

442
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:21,082
AND HE ALSO MADE REFERENCE

443
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:22,984
TO SOMETHING I'M SURE PEOPLE

444
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:25,119
HAD FORGOTTEN DURING THE

445
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,788
TRANSITION THAT IT WAS

446
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:29,257
REVEALED THAT MONEY WAS

447
00:10:29,257 --> 00:10:31,359
OFFERED TO WOMEN TO COME

448
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:33,094
FORWARD AND MAKE THESE

449
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:35,830
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THEN

450
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,766
CANDIDATE TRUMP.

451
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:39,434
SO HE THEN KNOWS HOW IT

452
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:39,734
FEELS.

453
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:40,869
LET ME MAKE ONE

454
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:41,303
CLARIFICATION.

455
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:42,204
THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING

456
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:44,406
ABOUT THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE

457
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:45,540
PROCESS.

458
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,675
AGAIN SAYING SKEPTICAL OF

459
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:47,309
THE ACCUSERS.

460
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:48,810
IS HE SKEPTICAL OF THE WAY

461
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,779
THIS PROCESS HAS ROLLED OUT

462
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,948
NOT JUST IN THE SENATE

463
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:54,082
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN THE

464
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:55,984
12TH HOUR A MAN WHO HAS

465
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:57,018
SUCCESSFULLY UNDERGONE SIX

466
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:58,687
THOROUGH VETS BY THE FBI.

467
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,654
AND THEY ARE THOROUGH, TRUST

468
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:00,255
ME.

469
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:01,223
TALK TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS

470
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:02,757
EVER KNOWN YOU.

471
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:03,925
GO THROUGH LOTS OF PAPERS AS

472
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:05,460
WELL AS THEY SHOULD.

473
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,428
HE SUCCEEDED THAT WAY.

474
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:07,896
NO ONE EVER CAME FORWARD FOR

475
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:09,898
36 YEARS.

476
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:11,066
TALKING ABOUT ALLEGATIONS OF

477
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,134
CONDUCT AS A TEENAGER.

478
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:13,301
BECAME A POWERFUL MAN ALONG

479
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:15,670
WITH FEMALE LAW CLERKS AND

480
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,506
THEY SUPPORT HIM.

481
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:19,241
NOT A SCINTILLA, NOT A WHIFF

482
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:20,042
OF AN ALLEGATION.

483
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:21,443
AND SO THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO

484
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:22,911
TALKING ABOUT THE UNFAIRNESS

485
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:24,312
OF THE PROCESS.

486
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:26,114
THAT SOMEBODY CAN SUBMIT

487
00:11:26,114 --> 00:11:27,716
ANSWERS TO 1300 WRITTEN

488
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:30,852
QUESTIONS, PRODUCE OVER

489
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:31,687
1 MILLION DOCUMENTS.

490
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:35,190
HAVE 30 HOURS PLUS OF SWORN

491
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,258
TESTIMONY TO THE SAME

492
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:36,625
COMMITTEE.

493
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,860
AND SIT AND HAVE AUTHORED

494
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,162
OVER 300 OPINIONS THAT

495
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:41,663
EVERYBODY HAS SCOURED.

496
00:11:41,663 --> 00:11:43,098
OVER 300 OPINIONS HAVE THAT

497
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:45,434
HAVE BEEN SCRUTINIZED OVER

498
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:46,869
TIME ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT.

499
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:47,569
AND NOTHING.

500
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:48,837
SO THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO

501
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:49,738
SAYING IT'S UNFAIR AND THE

502
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:51,840
PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.

503
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,742
GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN IN THE

504
00:11:53,742 --> 00:11:54,610
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOMINATED TO

505
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,744
THE SUPREME COURT BY

506
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:56,245
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

507
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:57,379
IT'S TERRIBLE TO TRY TO

508
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:59,315
SHAME AND BLAME AND NAME

509
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:01,583
PEOPLE MERELY BECAUSE OF WHO

510
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,284
IS NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME

511
00:12:02,284 --> 00:12:02,584
COURT.

512
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:03,786
THE PRESIDENT IS TOUGH.

513
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:04,787
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS TOUGH.

514
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:06,055
HE WANTS TO CLEAR HIS NAME

515
00:12:06,055 --> 00:12:07,890
AS HE TOLD YOUR COLLEAGUE,

516
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,425
MARTHA MACCALLUM, AND I HOPE

517
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:11,560
HE SHOWS SOME RIGHTEOUS

518
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,127
INDIGNATION TODAY.

519
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:14,063
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR

520
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:14,330
HIM.

521
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,130
HE IS NOT A POLITICIAN LIKE

522
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,299
THE POLITICIANS HE WILL BE

523
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:17,633
FACING.

524
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:20,469
HE IS NOT A SLICK PERSON ON

525
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:22,438
TV WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY FOR

526
00:12:22,438 --> 00:12:22,838
THE CAMERAS.

527
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:25,474
IS HE A JUDGE AND PUBLIC

528
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:25,874
SERVANT.

529
00:12:25,874 --> 00:12:26,308
BRIAN: GOTCHA.

530
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:26,875
KELLYANNE.

531
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,043
>> HE DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS

532
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:28,377
EITHER.

533
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:29,078
I'M GLAD THEY ARE GOING TO

534
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:30,279
BE THERE.

535
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:30,913
BRIAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT

536
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:31,680
SOMETHING ELSE THAT COULD OR

537
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,514
COULD NOT BE HAPPENING

538
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:32,815
TODAY.

539
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:33,882
WE THOUGHT IT WAS ON THE

540
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:34,783
SCHEDULE THE PRESIDENT

541
00:12:34,783 --> 00:12:35,951
INDICATED IT MIGHT BE PUT

542
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:36,218
OFF.

543
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:37,519
THAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S

544
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,487
ONE-ON-ONE WITH DEPUTY

545
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:39,154
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD

546
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:41,290
ROSENSTEIN WHO CAME TO THE

547
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,491
WHITE HOUSE MONDAY WILD

548
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:43,692
SPECULATION HE WAS ABOUT TO

549
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:45,628
BE FIRED OR RESIGN.

550
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:47,296
NOW THEY ARE GOING TO MEET

551
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:47,963
THURSDAY.

552
00:12:47,963 --> 00:12:48,697
STEVE: TODAY.

553
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:49,131
BRIAN: TODAY.

554
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:49,965
MAYBE MEET FOR THE FIRST

555
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:51,334
TIME SINCE THE ARTICLE CAME

556
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:52,835
OUT SAYING HE CONSIDERED THE

557
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:53,569
25TH AMENDMENT WEARING A

558
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:54,837
WIRE TO TRY TO SET THE

559
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:56,539
PRESIDENT UP TO SHOW HE IS

560
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:57,406
INCOMPETENT AND OUST HIM

561
00:12:57,406 --> 00:12:58,774
ALONG WITH ANDY MCCABE.

562
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:00,076
I'M JUST WONDERING TODAY IF

563
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:05,982
THAT MEETING COMES OFF IS

564
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:06,782
THERE ANY INDICATION FROM

565
00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:07,717
THE PRESIDENT WHICH WAY HE

566
00:13:07,717 --> 00:13:08,050
WILL GO.

567
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,985
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE

568
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:10,353
WOULD PREFER THAT THE DEPUTY

569
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:11,120
ATTORNEY GENERAL STAY ON THE

570
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,355
JOB AND GET THE JOB DONE.

571
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:13,689
THOSE WERE HIS WORDS

572
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:14,056
YESTERDAY.

573
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:14,724
AT THE SAME TIME, THE

574
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:15,891
PRESIDENT AND THE DEPUTY

575
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:18,294

00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:19,595

GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THE

578
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,464
CONVERSATION.

579
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:22,432
THE PRESIDENT, I KNOW FIRST

580
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:23,833
HAND WILL ASK THE TOUGH

581
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:24,267
QUESTIONS.

582
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:26,069
WILL WANT ALL THE TRUTHFUL

583
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,402
ANSWERS.

584
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:27,437
AND THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY

585
00:13:27,437 --> 00:13:29,706
GENERAL HAS DENIED THIS.

586
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:30,239
STEVE: IS IT TODAY?

587
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,841
>> IT'S SCHEDULED FOR TODAY.

588
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:35,178
THE PRESIDENT IS FLYING BACK

589
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:37,780
FROM UNGA WHERE HE HAD A

590
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,449
VERY SUCCESSFUL FEW DAYS AT

591
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:40,950
UNGA AND HE WILL COME BACK

592
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,453
HERE AND A LOT ON HIS DOCKET

593
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:44,353
INCLUDING MEETING WITH THE

594
00:13:44,353 --> 00:13:45,054
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL.

595
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:46,856
IF IT NEEDS TO GET PUSHED A

596
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:47,724
FEW HOURS OR MAYBE TO THE

597
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:48,591
NEXT DAY THEY WILL.

598
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:49,759
THEY ARE BOTH COMMITTED TO

599
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,094
SPEAKING WITH EACH OTHER AND

600
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:53,363
RESOLVING THIS ONCE AND FOR

601
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:53,796
ALL.

602
00:13:53,796 --> 00:13:54,397
BRIAN: YOUR OBSERVATION,

603
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:55,565
BECAUSE I TALKED TO ONE OF

604
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:57,066
ROD ROSENSTEIN'S FRIENDS

605
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:57,433
YESTERDAY.

606
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:58,935
HE SAID THAT THE PERCEPTION

607
00:13:58,935 --> 00:13:59,802
IS THAT THEY DON'T GET

608
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:00,436
ALONG.

609
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:01,671
HE SAID BUT ROD ROSENSTEIN

610
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:03,473
TOLD HIM THEY DO GET ALONG.

611
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:04,841
THEY AGREE ON ONE THING.

612
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,542
ANDY MCCABE CANNOT BE

613
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,311
TRUSTED AND BECAUSE OF THAT,

614
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:10,813
THEY HAVE ALMOST BEEN

615
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:11,614
GALVANIZED TOGETHER.

616
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:12,382
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU

617
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:14,150
COULD GET BEHIND, TOO?

618
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,885
>> IT'S A VERY FAIR POINT.

619
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:17,854
I HAVE BEEN IN MEETINGS VERY

620
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:18,921
RECENTLY WITH BOTH THE

621
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:19,589
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND

622
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:20,056
THE PRESIDENT.

623
00:14:20,056 --> 00:14:21,324
THERE IS A GREAT EXCHANGE OF

624
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:22,225
INFORMATION ON THE ISSUES

625
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:26,996
AFFECTING THIS COUNTRY

626
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:27,830
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS

627
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,132
HERE WITH A CABINET MEETING

628
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:30,199
WITH GENERAL KELLY AND

629
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:30,533
OTHERS.

630
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:31,801
I THINK SOME IN THE MEDIA

631
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:36,939
GOT CAUGHT BETWEEN IS IT

632
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:38,574
FIRING AND RESIGNATION HOW

633
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:40,843
ABOUT IS IT A MEETING?

634
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:43,646
I HOME THEY FERRETED OUT OUT

635
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:44,180
LEAKERS.

636
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,415
I HOPE THEY FIND OUT WHO

637
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:46,749
LEAKED THE INFORMATION.

638
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:49,118
I WOULD LOVE THAT WHAT I

639
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:50,453
WOULD SAY IN ADDITION IS

640
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:51,721
THERE A POINT TO BE MADE

641
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:52,355
ABOUT MCCABE.

642
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:54,657
WHEN ROD ROSENSTEIN AUTHORED

643
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:56,859
THAT LETTER ON MAY 9TH,

644
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:58,361
2017, GO BACK AND READ IT.

645
00:14:58,361 --> 00:15:01,397
IT REALLY GOES WAY ABOVE AND

646
00:15:01,397 --> 00:15:02,632
BEYOND A SIMPLE, I THINK

647
00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:04,100
IT'S TIME FOR COMEY TO GO.

648
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,734
HE SAYS WHY.

649
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:07,170
HE SAYS THAT JIM COMEY AS

650
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,607
FBI DIRECTOR TOTALLY USURPED

651
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:11,774
THE POSITION AND RIGHTS OF

652
00:15:11,774 --> 00:15:14,043
THE THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL

653
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:14,844
LORETTA LYNCH.

654
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:16,045
THAT JIM COMEY DID THE

655
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:17,013
TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT

656
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:18,915
TO DO ONCE THE INVESTIGATION

657
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:20,383
IN THIS CASE, THE EMAIL

658
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:21,217
INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY

659
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:21,751
CLINTON.

660
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:23,887
HE SAID THAT THE MISHANDLING

661
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:26,589
OF THE EMAIL INVESTIGATION

662
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:30,293
BY JIM COMEY HAD BROUGHT

663
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:36,066
TOGETHER PEOPLE DOJ AND FBI

664
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:38,168
PEOPLE MAD AT ROD

665
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:38,568
ROSENSTEIN.

666
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:39,503
I SEE A TREND HERE.

667
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:40,837
JIM COMEY HEAD OF THE FBI

668
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:43,373
GOT FIRED, HAD NOTES, GOT A

669
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:44,908
BOOK DEAL AND LEAKED THE

670
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:46,443
NOTES TO THE MEDIA.

671
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:48,245

672
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:49,446

00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,648
I SEE A TREND HERE.

676
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:53,617
WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT TOO.

677
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:54,584
NEVER UNDER ESTIMATE THE

678
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:58,588
POWER OF PEOPLE'S EGGOS AND

679
00:15:58,588 --> 00:15:59,456
SELF-IDOLATRY.

680
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:00,090
