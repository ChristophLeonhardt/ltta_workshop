a little bit of good news here it's wrapped in bad news the bad news of course is the opioid epidemic that's going on across the country record number of people dying and it's just been devastating so one of the place that have been devastated is Cook County you know in Illinois the good news is that they decided to fight back which is great so let me read from hub posts on what's going on here Cook County Illinois which includes Chicago the nation's third largest city reported a 70% increase in opioid related deaths between 2015 and 2016 according to the medical examiner's office in the city of Chicago 741 people died from opioid-related overdoses in similar to the number of people who died from gun violence that year so you know you hear people on television constantly talking about the violence in Chicago those are usually white right-wingers who then will add the next sentence what about the culture well what about the culture of the entirety of America that has got all of us hooked on opioids or far far too many of us and so one of the ways that you fight back against that issue is through education and through legal means and so that's what Chicago's decided to do pursue because those are huge numbers a 70% increase in one year alone is unreal so here is Tom preppin Winkle or pret Winkle I should say he says we believe a good start is - and he's of course the Cook County's Board of Commissioners president says we believe a good start is to aggressively confront one of the root causes of this national epidemic the pharmaceutical companies and those paid by the pharmaceutical companies who put profits before public health and safety now remember this is the strategy that they use against big tobacco and it was remarkably successful when it got a ton of money to do education programs which led to less people smoking less people getting cancer and saving untold number of lives certainly hundreds of thousand but arguably millions of lives so in this case if this industry is being irresponsible legal means are a perfectly good way to get them under control and that's obviously what Cook County is now considering doing so marina Fenkell reporting and Huffington Post continues on this though officials want the companies to pay monetary damages for costs incurred by the county's hospitals in jail for treating the opioid crisis the goal is to hold accountable those who have been complicit in the creation of this epidemic Cook County State's Attorney Kim Fox said in a statement make sense to me we're all bearing the costs as usual with the drug companies as with a lot of companies they have privatized the gains and socialize the losses losses are borne not only by our families but by taxpayer dollars going to treat folks in an epidemic that was clearly created by the drug company and according to internal documents that have been reported previously both elsewhere and here show that they actually did know the scale of addiction that it would create okay the lawsuit cites the company's coordinated and sophisticated and highly deceptive marketing of prescription painkillers like oxycontin and percocet which public health officials have named as a major cause of the opioid crisis so they're going right after the people who created in the first place obviously we'll have to see how the lawsuit plays out we don't know yet you won't know until they've got a new process and you've gone through the whole system and then we have a decision but that decision could be problematic for those drug companies but it could be great for the American people in the people of Cook County if it leads to a situation where people are more aware of the dangers and we get healthier overall as a country and they're not the only ones doing it in September 41 state attorneys general filed subpoenas demanding information from several major drug manufacturers as part of an investigation into what role the companies may have played in worsening the crisis so from time to time you will hear Republicans say all tort reform don't let him sue anyone well that's an effort to protect corporations at everyone else's expense part of the how we get things back in line and and in balance with what the American public actually wants is through the legal system and and it's worked before with Big Tobacco and lawyers that won those cases for the municipalities the localities and the states that suit Big Tobacco did a world of good for the country and it could happen here again you just watch the video by the young turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
