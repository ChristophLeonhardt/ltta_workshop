friends from a line it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the first</font>

17
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:28,529
time she was at an event where she was

18
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,420
truly surrounded by all my friends from

19
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,679
the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Harry Potter and</font>

21
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">it i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it was quite cool and then</font>

22
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,559
also really strange to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in that</font>

23
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,360
situation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> she was kind of asking</font>

24
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,700
lots of questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and meeting</font>

25
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,140
the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was kind of hanging</font>

26
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,489
out with that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hanging out with now</font>

27
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">and was a really big thing for me and i</font>

28
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,570
was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy that my friends could</font>

29
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,789
could meet her too she was relaying some

30
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,199
stories from her perspective like for

31
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">example when I think it was the fifth or</font>

32
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,590
sixth book came out we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sports</font>

33
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,210
day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> even though I stayed up all</font>

34
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,530
right the night before reading the book

35
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,180
and I think I'd read it twice maybe by

36
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,800
that time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a reaction video and</font>

37
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,390
all that stuff I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tommy found at</font>

38
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,069
sports daily huddled over the book

39
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,260
reading it rereading it devouring it and

40
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,080
just because it like felt like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

41
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,780
of gift and in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways I guess maybe</font>

42
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,310
that was a bad thing maybe I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't as</font>

43
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,840
present as I could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been but at the</font>

44
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,640
same time like I was being present in

45
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,740
other ways and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't regret that at</font>

46
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,600
all and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Saturday the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

49
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,090
