1
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:05,513
RISING TOXIC GAS.

2
00:00:05,513 --> 00:00:06,681
ERIC: PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE ARE

3
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:08,082
TOLD, WILL HAVE A PHONE

4
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:10,018
CONVERSATION TOMORROW WITH NORTH

5
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:11,586
KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG UN.

6
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:13,321
THIS, OF COURSE, FOLLOWS THEIR

7
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:14,756
HISTORIC SUMMIT TRYING TO RID

8
00:00:14,756 --> 00:00:16,324
THE REGIME OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

9
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:17,592
THE PRESIDENT DID SAY THAT

10
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:18,893
ANOTHER ISSUE WAS DISCUSSED

11
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,161
DURING THEIR MEETING, THAT OF

12
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:21,462
HUMAN RIGHTS.

13
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:23,431
BUT CRITICS ARE SAYING HUMAN

14
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:24,699
RIGHTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE

15
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:25,867
PROMINENT DURING THE SUMMIT AND

16
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:29,537
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT TOUGH

17
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:30,538
RIGHTS ABUSES.

18
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:33,541
HERE IS HOW HE RESPONDED ABOUT

19
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:33,841
THAT.

20
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:35,376
>> YOU HAVE SPOKEN SO

21
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:36,377
PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE

22
00:00:36,377 --> 00:00:38,212
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO OTTO

23
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:39,047
WARM BEER'S DEATH.

24
00:00:39,047 --> 00:00:40,481
>> YEAH.

25
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:42,650
>> IN THE SAME BREATH, YOU'RE

26
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,352
DEFENDING KIM JONG UN'S HUMAN

27
00:00:44,352 --> 00:00:44,786
RIGHTS RECORD.

28
00:00:44,786 --> 00:00:45,787
>> YOU KNOW WHY?

29
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:47,188
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE A

30
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:48,323
NUCLEAR WEAPON DESTROY YOU AND

31
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:49,691
YOUR FAMILY, OKAY?

32
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:50,591
>> WELL --

33
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:51,960
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT, I

34
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,962
DON'T WANT TO SEE A NUCLEAR

35
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:55,430
WEAPON DESTROY YOU AND YOUR

36
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,797
FAMILY --

37
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:57,398
>> HOW CAN KIM LOVE HIS PEOPLE

38
00:00:57,398 --> 00:00:58,566
IF HE'S KILLING THEM?

39
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:00,401
>> I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT.

40
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:01,769
I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO THE FACT

41
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,538
THAT WE SIGNED AN INCREDIBLE

42
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:04,839
AGREEMENT, IT'S GREAT, AND IT'S

43
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,641
GOING TO BE GREAT FOR THEM TOO.

44
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:10,211
ERIC: SO WHAT ARE THOSE ABUSES?

45
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:12,647
PROFESSOR WALTER HATCH JOINS US

46
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:15,350
FROM COLBY COLLEGE IN

47
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,017
WATERVILLE, MAINE.

48
00:01:16,017 --> 00:01:17,485
HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE HUMAN

49
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:19,454
RIGHTS RECORD OF KIM JONG UN?

50
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,322
>> WELL, FIRST, THANKS FOR

51
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:22,857
INVITING ME ON, ERIC.

52
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:24,425
I WOULD SAY THAT THE HUMAN

53
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:26,561
RIGHTS RECORD IN NORTH KOREA IS

54
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:27,862
PERHAPS THE WORST OF ANY COUNTRY

55
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:28,696
IN THE WORLD.

56
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:30,431
IT'S TRULY ATROCIOUS.

57
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:31,532
ERIC: ANY COUNTRY?

58
00:01:31,532 --> 00:01:33,134
THE WORST?

59
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:33,768
>> YEAH.

60
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:34,836
I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER THAT

61
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:36,671
HAS A WORSE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD.

62
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:42,143
THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT HAS UP TO

63
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,378
200,000 PRISONERS DETAINED AT

64
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:46,481
ANY ONE TIME IN FOUR DIFFERENT

65
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,484
GULAGS AROUND THE COUNTRY.

66
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,186
PEOPLE ARE EXECUTED RIGHT AND

67
00:01:52,186 --> 00:01:54,389
LEFT FOR BEING POLITICAL

68
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:55,857
DISSIDENTS OR SIMPLY NOT BEING

69
00:01:55,857 --> 00:01:57,592
SUFFICIENTLY LOYAL TO THE

70
00:01:57,592 --> 00:01:58,726
REGIME.

71
00:01:58,726 --> 00:02:02,430
KIM JONG UN HAS HAD HIS UNCLE

72
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,599
EXECUTED, HE'S HAD HIS OWN

73
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,266
BROTHER MURDERED.

74
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:09,137
THIS IS NOT A NICE REGIME.

75
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:11,372
ERIC: YEAH, TALK A BIT ABOUT

76
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:11,706
PRISONS.

77
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:13,708
WE HAVE SOME PICTURES OF THOSE.

78
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,043
THEY'RE CALLED CONCENTRATION

79
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:16,477
CAMPS, AND THERE ARE EVEN

80
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:17,912
REPORTS THAT IF YOUR GRANDFATHER

81
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:20,515
DEFIED THE REGIME, DEFIED KIM'S

82
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,449
GRANDFATHER, THREE GENERATIONS

83
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:23,684
OF A FAMILY COULD BE IMPRISONED

84
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:25,353
FOR THEIR WHOLE LIVES IN THESE

85
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,155
POLITICAL PRISONS?

86
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:29,057
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST

87
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:29,657
REMARKABLE THINGS.

88
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:32,427
IT'S NOT JUST INDIVIDUALS, BUT

89
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:34,262
ENTIRE FAMILIES ARE DETAINED.

90
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:35,930
AND DURING THESE INTERROGATIONS

91
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,400
THAT ARE CONDUCTED, TORTURE IS

92
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,836
ROUTINELY USED.

93
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:45,006
WOMEN ARE RAPED.

94
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,508
AGAIN, THIS REGIME IS

95
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:49,077
EXTRAORDINARILY BAD IN ITS HUMAN

96
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:49,777
RIGHTS RECORD.

97
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:51,212
AND THERE'S AN OFFICIAL POLICY

98
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:55,183
OF DISCRIMINATION, THE POLICY

99
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:57,018
THAT THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME

100
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:59,454
USES IDENTIFIES PARTICULAR

101
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:04,692
GROUPS -- CHRISTIANS, LANDLORDS,

102
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:08,096
PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEN AS SOMEHOW

103
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:11,099
ADVANTAGED ARE UNDER ESPECIALLY

104
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,166
CLOSE SURVEILLANCE.

105
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,802
BUT, IN FACT, EVERYBODY IS

106
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:16,804
SURVEILLED CLOSELY IN NORTH

107
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:17,371
KOREA.

108
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:18,906
ALL -- IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH,

109
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,908
AND VERY FEW PEOPLE DO HAVE

110
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:22,844
ACCESS TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS OR

111
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:25,179
THE INTERNET -- ALL OF THOSE

112
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:29,450
KINDS OF COMMUNICATIONS OR

113
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,451
ELECTRONIC ACTIVITY ARE

114
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:32,653
ROUTINELY MONITORED BY BUREAU 27

115
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:34,589
OF THE STATE SECURITY.

116
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,258
THIS IS A REGIME THAT TAKES NO

117
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,828
CHANCES WITH ITS PEOPLE, THAT

118
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:44,532
BROOKS NO DISSENT OR EVEN MILDLY

119
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:46,434
QUESTIONING BEHAVIOR.

120
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:46,767
FINISH.

121
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,169
ERIC: STATE DEPARTMENT HAD A

122
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,103
PRETTY SHOCKING REPORT.

123
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,239
LET ME READ YOU SOME OF THAT.

124
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,040
IT SAYS THE GOVERNMENT ENGAGES

125
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,510
IN, QUOTE: KILLINGS, FORCED

126
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,311
LABOR, TORTURE, RAPE, FORCED

127
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:59,447
ABORTIONS AND OTHER SEXUAL

128
00:03:59,447 --> 00:03:59,914
VIOLATION.

129
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:01,883
FORCED LABOR AND MASS

130
00:04:01,883 --> 00:04:02,517
MOBILIZATIONS, REEDUCATION

131
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:05,153
THROUGH A LABOR EXAMPLE CAMPS,

132
00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:06,154
ETC., ETC.

133
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:07,421
MANY OF THE COUNTRY'S HUMAN

134
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,724
RIGHTS ABUSES UNDERWRITE THEIR

135
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:11,292
REGIME'S WEAPONS PROGRAM, AND IT

136
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,393
CONTINUES BY SAYING THAT

137
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:13,961
INCLUDES THE FORCE LABOR AND

138
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,396
THOSE MASS MOBILIZATIONS,

139
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:16,363
REEDUCATION AT THE LABOR CAMPS

140
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:18,666
AND AND OVERSEAS LABOR

141
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,233
CONTRACTS.

142
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,935
THOUSANDS OF NORTH KOREANS ARE

143
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:22,170
SENT ABROAD EVERY YEAR TO WORK

144
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,205
IN SLAVE-LIKE CONDITIONS EARNING

145
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:25,039
REVENUE FOR THE REGIME.

146
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:26,641
HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS?

147
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,310
DOES THE PRESIDENT RAISE THIS

148
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,611
FURTHER, STRONGER IN HIS

149
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,180
CONVERSATION TOMORROW WITH KIM,

150
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,882
OR SHOULD IT BE RAISED ON A

151
00:04:34,882 --> 00:04:35,316
LOWER LEVEL?

152
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,151
YOU KNOW, HE SAYS PRIMARILY THE

153
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,020
GOAL IS DEALING WITH NUCLEAR

154
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,855
WEAPONS, BUT WHAT SHOULD WE DO

155
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:42,123
TRYING TO CHANGE THIS BEHAVIOR?

156
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:44,025
>> RIGHT.

157
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:45,393
WELL, THIS'LL SOUND ODD COMING

158
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:48,496
FROM THE DIRECTOR OF A HUMAN

159
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,665
RIGHTS PROGRAM, YOU KNOW, AT

160
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,767
COLBY COLLEGE, I DIRECT THE OAK

161
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:53,935
INSTITUTE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.

162
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:55,369
BUT I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THE

163
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:56,103
PRESIDENT, WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP

164
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:58,472
ON THIS, THAT HUMAN RIGHTS

165
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:00,041
PROBABLY SHOULD NOT BE FRONT AND

166
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,776
CENTER OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS.

167
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:04,145
WE'RE TRYING, AFTER ALL, TO

168
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:06,280
BROKER SOME KIND OF PEACE

169
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,984
AGREEMENT OR DISARMAMENT PLAN,

170
00:05:09,984 --> 00:05:12,987
TRYING TO PERSUADE KIM REGIME TO

171
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:15,089
IMPROVE ITS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD,

172
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,792
I THINK, WOULD NOT BE FRUITFUL

173
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:20,194
AT THIS POINT.

174
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,197
ERIC: DO YOU THINK --

175
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,332
>> ON THE OTHER HAND, I JUST

176
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,566
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF

177
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:27,034
DISCOURSE OR RHETORIC THAT'S

178
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:27,969
COME FROM OUR PRESIDENT WHERE

179
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:31,172
HE'S PRAISED KIM JONG UN AS

180
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:33,708
SMART AND TALENTED AND FUNNY,

181
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,377
HAS SAID THAT HE HAS THE BEST

182
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,078
INTERESTS OF THE NORTH KOREAN

183
00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:39,447
PEOPLE IN MIND, THAT HE LOVES

184
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:40,881
HIS PEOPLE, THAT HE WANTS TO

185
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,683
TAKE CARE OF THEM.

186
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:46,254
THESE KINDS OF STATEMENTS ARE

187
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:49,090
PATENTLY FALSE, AND I DON'T

188
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,525
THINK THEY DO ANYTHING BUT

189
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:53,261
LEGITIMIZE ONE OF THE WORLD'S

190
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:55,630
MOST BRUTAL DICK A TODAY TO

191
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,864
HAVES -- DICTATORS.

192
00:05:56,864 --> 00:05:58,633
ERIC: AND FINALLY, OTTO

193
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,768
WARMBIER, THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS

194
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:01,636
BASICALLY MURDERED IN PRISON.

195
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,070
SHOULD THE PRESIDENT OR THE

196
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,171
ADMINISTRATION AT SOME POINT

197
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:05,273
BRING THAT CASE UP?

198
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:07,341
IT IS CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT'S

199
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:10,177
HEART, WE ARE TOLD, TO PROSECUTE

200
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:13,414
THE KILLERS OF OTTO WARMBIER?

201
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,549
TELL KIM TO PROSECUTE THIS YOUNG

202
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:16,984
MAN'S MURDERERS?

203
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:19,820
>> AGAIN, I HATE TO SOUND COLD,

204
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,422
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT MAKES

205
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,292
THE MOST SENSE RIGHT NOW TO PUT

206
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:26,827
OTTO WARMBIER'S CASE ON THE

207
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:27,128
TABLE.

208
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:28,129
WE COULD ALSO, I MEAN, THIS IS

209
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,630
WHAT PRIME MINISTER ABE OF JAPAN

210
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,400
HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR, IS TALKING

211
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,604
ABOUT THE ALMOST 20 PEOPLE FROM

212
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,039
JAPAN THAT WERE ABDUCTED,

213
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,675
ACTUALLY KIDNAPPED FROM JAPAN BY

214
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:42,710
NORTH KOREAN INTELLIGENCE IN THE

215
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,712
LATE '70s AND '80s.

216
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:47,515
I MEAN, THERE'S SO MUCH THAT A

217
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:50,284
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT COULD

218
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,386
INSIST ON, BUT I THINK THAT

219
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:55,956
NEEDS TO COME AFTER SOME KIND OF

220
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:57,158
MOVEMENT TOWARDS NORMALIZATION

221
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:59,226
OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THESE TWO

222
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:03,064
HAS ILL COUNTRIES -- HOSTILE

223
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:03,798
COUNTRIES.

224
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,334
