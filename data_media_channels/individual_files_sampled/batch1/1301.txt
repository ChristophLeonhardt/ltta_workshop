this lush and beautiful is how Kerala should look and what attracts visitors tourism accounts for 12% of the southern Indian states economy and 20% of its jobs August's flooding has already hit the industry heart I think about 75 to 80 percent cancellations have happened during that period and everyone all the tourists who have been staying and having holiday in these affected areas have gone back a similar percentage of September's bookings have been canceled too the floods damaged roads rail lines and airports making it hard for visitors to get around they also damaged the places they might stay or visit this annual Boat Race normally happened in August this year it was canceled but though many of those in Kerala when the rains hit left and many about to come change their plans not all did after finishing a volunteer study and work placement arena Botha Lama and Anna segunda mangu have stuck to their plans spending time in varkala still in Kerala but just south of the worst of the floods we were thinking about moving maybe to go but at the end we we thought that it was okay to move here British family visiting relatives in Kerala has also decided to stay you know I think that's why I'm half guilty because we're helping at the same time like having the biggest impact will be felt from October when the peak tourist season for Kerala begins those in the industry expect a twenty to twenty five percent drop for the season as a whole marketing campaigns present this paradise but that image is undermined when these are the images broadcast internationally instead Kerala Tourism Minister was helping at a flood aid collection point last week but he is competent the visitors will be back a whole industry is badly effectively devastated I'm confident that we'll get our former glory back but it's going to take a lot of work the reason Kerala is so lush and beautiful is that every year it gets a lot of rain the rain this year of course has been exceptional but those in the tourism industry hope the state can bounce back more beautiful and just as popular as before Andrew Thomas al-jazeera warka our Carolyn
