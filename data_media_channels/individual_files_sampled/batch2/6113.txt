as we know the white house is experiencing a number of shake ups a number of individuals who are either being fired or pressured to resign and it seems as though there are other members of trumps administration that are now losing any sway or influence they have over the president the most recent example that's been reported about is actually John Kelly the White House chief of staff now recent reports indicate that Kelly actually wasn't with the president last week when Trump abruptly decided to fire a chart mcmaster as National Security Advisor and replace him with John Bolton just two people who were out just two people were in the room for that decision and those two people were Trump and Bolton and so there is a lot of concern that John Kelly is not only losing his influence but that John Kelly was one of the few people who kind of kept things under control in Trump's administration and if he's now kind of pushing Kelly away does that mean that there will be more chaos within the White House which is hard to believe but yeah I think that that could be likely yeah I mean I think it almost stands to reason that it would happen a Kelly was already besieged by this president who does all this stuff that is ridiculous he you know he talks first and ask questions later he's on Twitter late at night and all of these things and even the access to the president was being controlled by Kelly who was trying to get a hold of all of these things he was trying to bring some order to the general disorder that that Trump had it claims his operating style in the Oval Office with the loss of Kelly it's a little unclear as to what's going to happen but certainly that general freewheeling style and that's a generous way to put it with Trump you I might I would call it reckless will have no checks on it whatsoever or it certainly limited checks on it well it seems like in this new even scarier era of the Trump administration Trump just wants to be completely untethered he just wants to be able to do what he wants to do carry out whatever ideas he has at any given moment without any form of checks and balances with his administration and so if Kelly did serve as some sort of mitigating factor obviously Trump isn't gonna love that and you know there have been some White House staffers who have spoken to the media anonymously and mentioned that Trump doesn't even think that he necessarily needs a White House chief of staff if Kelly were to not be there anymore so that's that's a scary idea because it's look it's the way dictators think you know they don't want anyone advising them anyone controlling them anyone telling them what to do and Trump is kind of headed in that direction you know all the run-up to the Trump presidency you heard a lot about how he's a billionaire and how he runs these businesses and he'll be able to run this country but the truth is that the Trump the Trump businesses were really run as a small kind of corner store operation he didn't have a lot of people there wasn't a big infrastructure from a personnel standpoint it was really Trump and his family and they ran the whole place and that's sort of the way he wants to run the White House and now he's got Bolton in there who he likes because he sees him on Fox News talking tough and he lets his moustache and he brings him in there or he doesn't like his mother she finally decided to accept the mustache likes the tongue that's it okay tough talk weighs out weighs must have but anyway yeah whatever if those are the wrong reasons to have somebody involved in your inner circle but he's still in touch with Lewandowski and he's still in touch with scaramouche II yeah and he still ties all these advisors who were connecting to him even if they're not formally in his White House okay so I like that you mentioned those two names Corey Lewandowski and also Anthony scare Moochie those are two people that Kelly did not want around the White House under any circumstances now there are reports that Trump is in communications with them in fact Corey Lewandowski just recently met with Trump in DC and previously John Kelly had said that if Lewandowski were to visit the White House he would have to personally escort him and that didn't happen in this case Trump met with Lewandowski without John Kelly also last week when Trump spoke to President Vladimir Putin days before the u.s. decided to expel dozens of Russian diplomats Kelly was not on the call that's unprecedented right right it is it is so again it shows you that Kelly's influence is tapering off and also eight say that Kelly mishandled Rob Porter's departure first by revising a statement that praised the aide after news reports surfaced that he'd been accused of domestic violence and then by giving reporters and inaccurate timeline of events leading up to Porter's dismissal there are reports that Trump is still talking to rob Porter but it seems as though they are using Kelly's mishandling of that situation as a reason for why his influence is tapering up well that Rob Porter situation was bizarre and it was mishandled by Kelly but it seems that he might have been getting orders from Trump to try because Porter was very important to Trump he was a real kind of organizer of of trumps schedule of Trump's appearances all of these things as sort of secretary to the president but uh I they're clearly just hanging on Kelly all of these different things setting him up for you know his eventual departure and of course what we're hearing from the White House is the the same old same old the the calm before the storm the under know Kelly's awesome no we're not planning on getting rid of him and then that should immediately be a warning sign that Kelly will be gone very soon obviously that is my speculation but if you look at what's happened with this administration previously with the ouster of other officials they usually say that that person is safe they're not gonna get rid of that person and then a couple days later that person is gone yeah look the leaks and the journalism associated with this White House have been spot on I mean there really haven't been too many leaks or journalistic work associated with the White House that haven't been pretty accurate and so that's the word out of the White House you can kind of read the tea leaves pretty easily on this for all the reasons that Anna's mentioning you just see the way he's been diminished in terms of his access in terms of his connection to the President and you kind of just do the math he's gonna be gone you just watch the video by the young turks home the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network
