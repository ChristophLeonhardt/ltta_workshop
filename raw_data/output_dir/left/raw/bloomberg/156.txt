TOURISM NUMBERS.

5
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:12,212
HOW THE CHANGES ARE IMPACTING

6
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,948
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:19,518
EUROPE.

8
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:21,621
>> WE BEGIN WITH OUR MARKET

9
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,422
MINUTES AFTER MORE THAN A MOST

10
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:27,093
TOO MUCH ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE

11
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:27,660
NEXT RATE MOVE.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,530
JANET YELLEN SPOKE TODAY AND

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,265
U.S. STOCKS CLOSED MIXED.

14
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:37,303
THE S&P ENDEMOL CLOSING LOWER

15
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,071
FOR THE SECOND STRAIGHT DAY.

16
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:43,176
HEALTH CARE WAS THE BEST

17

PERFORMER.

18
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:44,577
THE NASDAQ FINISHED JUST IN THE

19
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,178
POSITIVE, VERILY.

20
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,347
OLIVER: THE NASDAQ HAS REMAINED

21
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,216
SOMEWHAT BOY IT AFTER THE PAST

22
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,486
COUPLE WEEKS.

23
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,688
LOOKING DEEPER IN THE STOCK

24
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:56,522
MARKET, I WON A LOOK AT A COUPLE

25
00:00:56,522 --> 00:01:00,393
OF THOSE SECTORS YOU MENTIONED.

26
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:05,531
UTILITIES NOT DOING SO WELL.

27
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:06,332
THAT HAS BEEN PART OF THE MARKET

28
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:06,933
HURTING QUITE A BIT.

29
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,603
MATT: THAT REMINDS ME OF THE

30
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,338
DEATH OF THE SAFETY TRADE.

31
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,274
AND THE BIRTH OF THIS

32
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,408
CONVERSATION THAT WILL KEEP

33
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:15,875
HAPPENING.

34
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,678
FINANCIALS HELD UP A BIT

35
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:19,512
POSSIBLY DUE TO THE FACT WE ARE

36
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:26,118
GETTING MORE HAWKISH.

37
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:26,653
BIGGER MOVES.

38
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:30,590
NOT A HUGE MOVE ON THE WEEK BUT

39
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,391
HE WAS LOOKING AT THE SAME KIND

40
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,125
OF REVERSAL OF THE TREND IN

41
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,128
WHICH FINANCIALS ARE STAYING IN

42
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:35,595
THE GREEN.

43
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,097
ENERGY GETTING HIT.

44
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:37,897
COMMODITIES NOT GETTING HIT.

45
00:01:37,897 --> 00:02:00,152
UTILITIES DOWN 3.2% ON THE WEEK.

46
00:02:00,152 --> 00:02:02,088
EVENTUALLY FLAT AFTER FISHER

47
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:02,922
CAME AND MUDDLED THAT MESSAGE A

48
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:03,256
BIT.

00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:08,995
OLIVER: SAINT -- A THREE-DAY

00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,599
YOU CAN SEE I PUT A LINE AT THE

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,469
CLOSE OF DAY TWO.

53
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,270
DAY TWO WAS ONE CARSON BLOCK

54
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,004
CAME ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION

55
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:23,009

56
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:23,810
OF HIS SHORT TRADE ON SAINT JUDE

57
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,180

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,851
FIRM THAT HE TEAMED UP WITH IN

59

61
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:38,191

THEIR THIRD DAY LOSSES AS SAINT

67
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,069
JUDE COMES OUT AND ESSENTIALLY

68
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,105
DENIES SOME OF THE CLAIMS CARSON

69
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,373
BLOCK MADE.

00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:58,578
SCARLET: LET'S CHECK THE BOND

71
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,479
MARKET.

72
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,614
THE TWO YEAR YIELD WAS

73
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:02,415
PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE BECAUSE

74
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,216
THE POSSIBILITY OF A RATE HIKE

75
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:08,654
SENT BONDS TUMBLING.

76
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:10,690
PRICES DROPPED, WHICH MEANS

77
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,925
YIELDS GO UP AND THAT IS WHAT

78
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:12,692
HAPPENED THERE TO 84 BASIS

79
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,560
POINTS.

80
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,664
THAT IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE

81
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:19,432
JUNE AND FUTURE RATE INCREASES

82
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,101
WILL BE GRADUAL.

83
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:22,935
YOU SEE THAT THE LONGER END OF

84
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:27,473
THE YIELD CURVE.

85
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,307
THE OVERALL RESULT IS A FLATTER

86
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:28,775
YIELD CURVE.

87
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:33,980
OLIVER: I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT

88
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,781
SOME OF THE CURRENCIES THAT HAVE

89
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,084
MOVED TODAY.

90
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:41,187
YOU SAW SOME DOLLAR WEAKNESS.

91
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:41,921
TAKE A LOOK AT THE POUND.

92
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,858
TAKE A LOOK AT THE YEN OR THIS

93
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:46,259
SCREEN.

94
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,964
I HAVE GOT THE DOLLAR RISING.

95
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,333
YOU CAN SEE THE INITIAL DROP

96
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,000
WITH THE RED ARROW AND

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,868
EVENTUALLY THE DOLLAR CLIMBING

98
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,270
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.

99
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,272
IF YOU DO LOOK AT ANY OF THOSE

100
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,074
CURRENCIES, PRETTY MUCH ANY

101
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,110
CURRENCY YOU WILL SEE A STRONGER

102
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,646
DOLLAR BECAUSE I THINK ONLY THE

103
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,948
ONE AND ONE OTHER SMALL

104
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,283
CURRENCY.

105
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:16,288
I WILL PULL IT UP.

106
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,291
THEN WE CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT

107
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,192
HAPPENED WITH CURRENCIES.

108
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:21,861
I WILL PUT EXPANDED MAJORS HERE

109
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,731
RATHER THAN JUST THE MAJORS AND

110
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:28,134
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE INDONESIAN

111
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:34,540
RUPEE.

112
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,910
SCARLET: NICE WORK.

113
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,412
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT COMMODITIES

114
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:39,846

115
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,149
OIL CLIMBED BUT DID GIVE BACK

116
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,618
MOST OF ITS GAINS.

117
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,385
LITTLE CHANGE IN COPPER AND

118
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:47,186
GOLD.

119
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,256
THINK RIGHTLY TO A 15 MONTH HIGH

120
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:50,723

121
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,259
IT HAS THE BEST-PERFORMING

122
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,829
COMMODITY IN LONDON THIS YEAR.

123
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,663
SIGNS OF A SHORTAGE WITH DEMAND

124
00:04:57,663 --> 00:05:05,170
HOLDING UP.

125
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:05,938
THOSE ARE TODAY'S MARKET

126
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:06,372
MINUTES.

127
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,008
NOW LET'S TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO

128
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,209
THE BLOOMBERG.

129
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,511

130
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,245
CHART AT THE FUNCTION AT THE

131
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:17,182
BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.

132
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,017
I WANTED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

133
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,485
FUNCTION THAT ALLOWS US TO CHECK

134
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,856
OUT TRADERS PARTICIPATING --

135
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,657
ANTICIPATING RATE INCREASES.

136
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:33,700
THE ODDS FOR A RATE HIKE 42% FOR

137
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,135
SEPTEMBER, 50% FOR NOVEMBER, AND

138
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,670
60% FOR DECEMBER.

139
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,507
IF YOU GO BACK TO YESTERDAY

140
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,341
BEFORE JANET YELLEN SPOKE, IT

141
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:49,649
WAS AT 32% YESTERDAY AND 54%.

142
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,818
YOU CAN SEE THE ODDS WERE MUCH

143
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54,687
LOWER THERE.

144
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,690
IN DECEMBER, 42%.

145
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,161
OLIVER: A BIT OF A CHANGE BUT

146
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:02,729
NOTHING HUGE.

147
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,698
NO VASTER REPRICING.

148
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:10,770

151
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:21,714
EXCITING FOR US OR THE MARKET.

152
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,716
THE PROBLEM IS $6 TRILLION WORTH

153
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,851
OF BOND MANAGERS ARE REALLY

154
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:28,821
FRUSTRATED BY THE DIRECTION OR

155
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:29,789
LACK THERE OF FROM THE FED.

156
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:34,627
SCARLET: MIKE JUST MESSAGED ME

157
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,497
SAYING THAT YOU REALLY NEED THE

158
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,834
ODDS TO GO OUT TO 70% FOR A GOOD

159
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:47,105
CHANCE OF FOLLOW-THROUGH.

160
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,842
THEY WANT TO GET TO 50%.

161
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:55,214
MATT: I HAVE A CHART I'M SURE

162
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,048
YOU HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF TIMES

163
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,817
BUT IT SHOWS CORPORATE PROFITS.

164
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,987
WE ARE IN THE LONGEST SLUMP

165
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:01,754
RIGHT NOW SINCE THE END OF THE

166
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,657
RECESSION IN MID-2009.

167
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,892
BROKEN DOWN BY QUARTERS, IT

168
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:10,496
SHOWS YOU HOW BAD IT HAS BEEN.

169
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,864
THE LAST TIME WE SAW A SLUMP

170
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,833
LIKE THIS ENDED IN THE SECOND

171
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:19,172
QUARTER OF 2009.

172
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,906
BEFORE YOU SEE GDP START TO TURN

173
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:21,774
AROUND, YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS

174
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,109
TAKE UP.

175
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,812
YOU WILL NOT SEE THE STRONG GDP

176
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,047
PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU IS

177
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:31,150
NECESSARY FOR NORMALIZATION OF

178
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,084
INTEREST RATES.

179
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:36,222
A 3.5% LEVEL OF GROWTH IS WHAT

180
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,123
WE HEARD TODAY.

181
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:41,260
FROM ECONOMISTS AND -- WHO WAS

182
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,162
IT THAT CAME ON AND SAID 3.5%?

183
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,131
SCARLET: O'LEARY.

184
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,135
MATT: KEVIN O'LEARY WAS TELLING

185
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,937
US.

HE IS WATCHING IT VERY CLOSELY.

187
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:58,544
OLIVER: ANOTHER RED BAR THERE

188
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,245
THAT USED TO BE GREEN.

189
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,348
BARELY IN THE RED NOW BUT STILL

190
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,550
SOME NEGATIVITY.

191
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,384
I WANT TO LOOK AT A POTENTIAL

192
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:09,422
EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE SOLD OFF

193
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:09,955
A BIT TODAY.

194
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:12,358
PART OF IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE

195
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,192
THERE WAS A POSITION WHERE THERE

196
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,227
WASN'T A LOT OF DIRECTION IN

197
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:18,264
WHICH THEY COULD GO.

198
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,433
FIRST WE LOOK AT THE MOVES ON A

199
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,200
YEARLY BASIS IN TERMS OF WHAT

200
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,234
HAPPENED FOR JACKSON HOLE

201
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:24,303
SPEECH.

202
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:27,673
GENERALLY WHEN THE FED CHAIR

203
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,441
COMES DOWN, STOCKS GO UP THE

204
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,342
NEXT WEEKEND AND IT'S LOOKING AT

205
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:33,412
A SENTIMENT GAUGE BY THE PANIC

206
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:41,486
INDEX.

207
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:44,557
BASICALLY THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS,

208
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,325
THAT PANIC GAUGE HAS JUMPED UP.

209
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,661
SHORT INTEREST HAS COME DOWN

210
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:49,495
HERE SO THE FACT THAT MAYBE THIS

211
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:54,400
IS SOME TYPE OF SELLING, JUST

212
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,401
ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION.

213
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:59,372
MATT: MIKE REGAN JOINS US NOW

214
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,542
WITH WRAPPING UP THE WEEK FOR US

215
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:04,210
IN TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT

216
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,445
HAPPENED AFTER JANET YELLEN

217
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,279
DIDN'T DISRUPT THE MARKET.

218
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,218
>> THE WEEK BOILS DOWN TO ONE

219
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,420
SPEECH WAITING ON THE EDGE OF

220
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:14,987
THEIR SEATS FOUR.

221
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:18,691
CHARLOTTE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE

222
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,525
WORLD INTEREST-RATE PROBABILITY

223
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:19,959
FUNCTION.

224
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,562
IT'S FASCINATING TO ME HOW A LOT

225
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,264
OF TRADERS ARE GLUED TO THAT

226
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,466
THING, REFRESHING IT EVERY DAY.

227
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,235
WHAT AMAZES ME IS HOW SWIFTLY

228
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,703
THAT THING CAN MOVE.

229
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,571
A 43% CHANCE OF INCREASE AS OF

230
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:38,844
TODAY.

231
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,247
IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT SIGNAL

232
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,048
THAT EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT THE

233
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:43,983
ONE OF THOSE BASED ON A

234
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,719
RELATIVELY SMALL MARKET.

235
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,990
NOT A HUGELY LIQUID MARKET ON A

236
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,824
RELATIVE BASIS COMPARED TO THE

237
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:59,064
STOCK MARKET.

238
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:03,135
THE TAKE AWAY FOR ME IS THAT IT

239
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,936
IS AN IMPORTANT SNAPSHOT THAT WE

240
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,804
CAN LOOK AT ANY TIME BUT IT'S A

241
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:11,410
SIGNAL WRITTEN IN PENCIL.

242
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,278
THAT IS THE IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY

243
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,546
FROM TODAY IS THAT THE ODDS LOOK

244
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:20,352
A LITTLE HIGHER BUT ANOTHER DATA

245
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:21,086
POINT, ANOTHER CONFLICTING

246
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:22,121
SPEECH COULD SEND IT THE OTHER

247
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:39,738
WAY.

248
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:40,573
I LIKE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT

249
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:47,379
THE SAFETY TRADE.

250
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:51,250
IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU

251
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,952
LOOK AT THESE GROUPS AS THE

252
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,153
SAFETY TRADE, DEFENSIVE

253
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,522
INDUSTRIES.

254
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,356
IT USED TO BE HEALTH CARE BUT

255
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,157
THAT HAS KIND OF AN DISMISSED

256
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:03,295
BECAUSE OF THE QUESTION OF

257
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,164
PRICING WITH THE ELECTION BUT IT

258
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:05,931
HAS REALLY BEEN NOT SO MUCH AS

259
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,535
SAFETY TRADING AS THIS DESPERATE

260
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,236
HUNT FOR YIELD TRAIT.

261
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,506
IT'S NOT LIKE UTILITY YIELDS ARE

262
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,273
HIGHER THAN THEY HAVE BEEN

263
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,009
TRADITIONALLY, JUST BOND LOWS --

264
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:21,813
YIELDS ARE SO LOW.

265
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:22,681
MATT: I HAVE THE ONE-MONTH GROUP

266
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,284
RETURNS HERE.

267
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:28,053
RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OVER THE

268
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:31,790
PAST 30 DAYS, UTILITIES, TELECOM

269
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,225
, AND THESE ARE THE TRADITIONAL

270
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:40,632
SAFETY GROUPS.

271
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:42,468
>> THAT ROTATION IS MORE

272
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:42,902
CYCLICAL.

273
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:43,669
OF COURSE ENERGY HAS A MIND OF

274
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,873
ITS OWN BUT FINANCIALS

275
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,741
ESPECIALLY, THE FINANCIAL INDEX

276
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,876
TODAY REACHING ITS HIGHEST LEVEL

277
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,710
OF THE YEAR AND A BROAD GROUP OF

278
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,180
COMPANIES BUT HEAVILY WEIGHTED

279
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,050
TO JPMORGAN, THE GROUPS THAT

280
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,817
STAND TO BENEFIT FROM HIGHER

281
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:00,019
RATES.

282
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:00,819
THE STOCK MARKET SEEMS TO BE

283
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,388
MORE CONFIDENT A RATE HIKE IS

284
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,590
COMING.

SITTING DOWN WITH US.

HEATER HENRY, THE DEAN OF THE

NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS.

304
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:15,581
>> DEAN HENREY HAD THE CATBIRD

305
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:22,620
SEAT.

306
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,624
HOW WAS IT RECEIVED IN THE ROOM?

307
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,826
THESE ARE ACADEMICS AND FED

308
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:28,660
POLICY MAKERS WHO ARE LOOKING AT

309
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,261
THIS FROM A DIFFERENT

310
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,596
PERSPECTIVE.

311
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,732
LIKE I THINK EVERYONE IS TAKING

312
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:34,333
THE LONG-TERM VIEW.

313
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,100
PEOPLE WAITING FOR REVELATIONS

314
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,239
TO HIM FROM THE PODIUM I THINK

315
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,039
WERE DISAPPOINTED BUT THERE ARE

316
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,543
A FEW THAT SAY WE HAVE TO RESUME

317
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,678
MONETARY POLICY FOR THE NEXT

318
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,280
CRISIS, NOT THINKING ABOUT HOW

319
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,114
WE CHANGE IT FOR THE NEXT COUPLE

320
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,683
WEEKS OR MONTHS.

321
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,252
>> IS THERE A GENERAL CONSENSUS

322
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,086
THAT POLICY AS WE KNOW IT HAS

323
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:54,620
RUN ITS COURSE?

00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,056
>> I THINK THERE'S A STRONG VIEW

325
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:00,759
THAT MONETARY POLICY HAS ON MOST

326
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,493
OF WHAT IT CAN ON ITS OWN TO

327
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,861
REALLY GENERATE RECOVERY.

328
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,898
BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS A

329
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,900
STRONG SENSE THAT WE ARE ALL

330
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,970
WAITING FOR THE FISCAL SIDE OF

331
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,704
THE HOUSE AND FOR LAWMAKERS TO

332
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:16,542
REALLY STEP UP AND DO WHAT MUST

333
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,776
BE DONE.

334
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:18,911
MONETARY POLICY HAS CREATED THE

335
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:25,884
CONDITIONS BUT WE HAVE SEEN A

336
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:26,652
REALLY CONTRACTIONARY FISCAL

337
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,287
POLICY.

338
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,087
WE ARE NOT SEEING POLICIES THAT

339
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:32,124
CAN REALLY DRIVE PRODUCTIVITY.

340
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,562
MUCH MORE NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO SEE

341
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,396
THE KIND OF ROBUST GROWTH WE ALL

342
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:37,963
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE.

343
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,832

344
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:42,101
POLICY MAKERS HAVE SHOWN NO

345
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,070
SIGNS OF COURAGE LATELY, DOES

346
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:45,904
MONETARY POLICY CONTINUE TO STEP

347
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,072
INTO THE BREACH AND DOES THAT

348
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,641
BECOME HARMFUL?

349
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,542
>> I THINK THERE'S A DANGER OF

350
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:56,448
OVERREACH.

351
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,217
I THINK YOU WILL SEE STRONG

352
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,051
EVIDENCE OF SOMEONE WHO IS AWARE

353
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,721
OF THE DANGERS OF OVERREACH.

354
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,488

00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:05,557
HUMBLE.

THEY WERE HEROES FOR A WHILE.

357
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:24,810
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE MONETARY

358
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,913
POLICY HAS RUN ITS COURSE.

359
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:28,714

360
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,181
RECESSION.

00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:34,553
IS THERE ANY CONFIDENCE, ANY

362
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,287
FEELING THAT PERHAPS CENTRAL

363
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,155
BANKS WILL COME INTO THE NEXT

364
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:37,923
CRISIS WITH LESS AMMUNITION?

365

366
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:43,862
LISTENED TO THE CHAIRS A SPEECH

367
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:44,730
THIS MORNING, GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW

368
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,198
TODAY, THERE ARE REASONS TO

369
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,567
BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT ARSENAL

370
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,270
THAT THE FED HAS IS SUFFICIENT

371
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,438
TO DEAL WITH WHAT MAY COME.

372
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:56,308
FOR INSTANCE IF YOU LOOK AT

373
00:17:56,308 --> 00:18:00,078
INTEREST RATES HISTORICALLY,

374
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,780
DURING THE TIMES THE ECONOMY HAS

375
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,548
GONE INTO RECESSION, IT TURNS

376
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,850
OUT THE STANCE OF MONETARY

377
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,617
POLICY HAS UNEXPECTEDLY BEEN

378
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,420
RELATIVELY TIGHT AT THE

379
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,755
BEGINNING OF HER SESSIONS,

380
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,489
MEANING THERE HAS BEEN A NEED

381
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,557
FOR BIGGER INTEREST-RATE MOVES

382
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:13,392
TO PROVIDE THE SLACK THE ECONOMY

383
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,828
NEEDED TO GET BACK ON TRACK.

384
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:17,629
EVEN THOUGH INTEREST RATES ARE

385
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,832
AT HISTORICAL LOWS, THERE MAY BE

386
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:22,634
MORE SLACK IN THE SYSTEM

387
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,569
PRESENTLY THAN IS FULLY

388
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:25,003
REALIZED.

389
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:30,909
>> IT WAS A MORNING OF THE

390
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:31,710
THEORIES ON THE TABLE AND HAVING

391
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,011
THEM DISCUSSED.

392
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,680
WHAT DREW YOU THE MOST INTEREST?

393
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,184
>> WHAT DREW THE MOST INTEREST

394
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,018
WAS THIS NOTION THAT THE NATURAL

395
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,054
RATE OF INTEREST IS AT AN

396
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,823
ALL-TIME HISTORICAL LOW.

397
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,827
IF WE THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THE

398
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:49,594
RATE OF RETURN TO CAPITAL AND

399
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:52,898
THAT REALLY DRIVES BOND YIELD IN

400
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,933
AN ECONOMY.

401
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,435
THE FACT THAT WE ARE AT ALL TIME

402
00:18:56,435 --> 00:19:00,739
HISTORICAL LOWS MEANS THAT

403
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:01,540
FRANKLY THE MONETARY POLICY HAS

404
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,575
REACHED A POINT WHERE IT CAN NO

405
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:08,880
LONGER DO MUCH TO REALLY DRIVE

406
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,581
REAL INVESTMENT OVER THE

407
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,048
LONG-TERM.

408
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:20,992
THAT SUGGESTS WE NEED GREATER

409
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:24,963
OPENNESS TO TRADE, LOWER LABOR

410
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:29,034
FORCE GROWTH WE HAVE SEEN.

411
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,937
THAT POINTS TO IMMIGRATION.

412
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:37,242
LOTS OF WHAT WE CALL STRUCTURAL

413
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,043
FORMS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN TO

414
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,579
DRIVE PRODUCTIVITY, DRIVE UP THE

415
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,180
NATIONAL RATE OF INTEREST FOR

416
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,981
THE UNDERLYING RATE OF RETURN TO

417
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,916
REAL INVESTORS TO PROPEL GROWTH.

418
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:48,754
THE QUESTION IS WHICH LAWMAKERS

419
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,922
ARE READY TO ACTUALLY EMBRACE

420
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,991
THIS REALITY AND MAKE THE

421
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:53,558
CHANGES WE NEED?

422
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:57,462
>> THERE DOES SEEM TO BE GENERAL

423
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,163
AGREEMENT THAT ONE OF THE

424
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,133
BIGGEST PROBLEMS IS THE DECLINE

425
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,168
IN PRODUCTIVITY WE HAVE SEEN.

426
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,505
DID ANYBODY COME UP WITH A

427
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,305
THEORY FOR WHAT IS CAUSING IT

428
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:07,939
AND WHAT SHOULD BE DONE?

429
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:09,241
>> NO DEFINITIVE THEORY BUT TO

430
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:13,278
GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW SERIOUS

431
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:16,515
THE DECLINE IS, FROM 1946 TO

432
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,282
2005, AVERAGE PRODUCTIVITY

433
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:23,255
GROWTH WAS 2.5% PER YEAR.

434
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,023
SINCE 2006, 1.25%.

435
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,225
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT IF YOU

436
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:30,295
COMBINE IT WITH THE FACT THAT

437
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,764
LABOR FORCE GROWTH HAS ALSO

438
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:33,198
SLOWED.

439
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,065
HISTORICALLY, IT'S ABOUT 1% PER

440
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:39,571
YEAR AND IS DECLINING 2.5% PER

441
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:39,938
YEAR.

442
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:40,539
THOSE FACTORS TOGETHER

443
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,775
AUTOMATICALLY LOCK YOU INTO

444
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:44,643
LONG-TERM POTENTIAL GROWTH LESS

445
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,144
THAN 2%, WHICH IS FAR BELOW WHAT

446
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:50,382
WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, CLOSER

447
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:50,782
TO 3%.

448
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:51,483
THAT IS A REAL CHALLENGE.

449
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:55,487
>> WHEN YOU'RE IN A CONFERENCE

450
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,422
LIKE THIS ALL DAY, YOU ARE

451
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,191
BASICALLY TALKING ABOUT

452
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,392
WORST-CASE SCENARIOS.

453
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,393
ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC, PESSIMISTIC?

454
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:06,531
>> I FEEL POSITIVE TO NEUTRAL.

455
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,800
I THINK THE FED HAS DONE AN

456
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,570
EXTRAORDINARY JOB OVER THE LAST

457
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,337
ALMOST DECADE NOW OF GRAPPLING

458
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,207
WITH A VERY SEVERE CRISIS,

459
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,608
PUTTING IN PLACE NEW TOOLS TO

460
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,779
HELP US DEAL WITH THAT CRISIS.

461
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,280
THERE IS STABILITY IN THE

462
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,981
ECONOMY.

463
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:23,648
WE ARE GROWING AGAIN.

464
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:26,084
BUT IT'S HARD TO BE OVERLY

465
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,619
OPTIMISTIC WHEN WE ARE GROWING

466
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,755
AT 2% AND WITH UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN

467
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:33,091
TO 5%, THERE'S STILL A REAL

468
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,026
CHANCE OF HAVING AN ECONOMY THAT

469
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:35,760
IS NOT PRODUCING THE KIND OF

470
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,529
INCOME GAINS THAT ARE EITHER

471
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,598
LARGE ENOUGH OR WIDELY

472
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,867
DISTRIBUTED ENOUGH TO REALLY

473
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,603
LIFT THE AVERAGE WORKING

474
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,906
AMERICAN FAMILY INTO A PLACE

475
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:48,740
THAT MAKES THEM FEEL CONFIDENT.

476
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,077
BECAUSE OF THAT, THERE IS THIS

477
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,278
REINFORCING FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE

478
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:54,980
EXPECTING LESS IN TERMS OF THEIR

479
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,215
INCOME, IN TERMS OF THEIR

480
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:57,916
ABILITY TO PUT THEIR KIDS

481
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,951
THROUGH SCHOOL.

482
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,854
SO THAT IS HAVING A DAMPENING

483
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,189
EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY TODAY.

484
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:10,495
SAME THING WITH BUSINESSES.

485
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,329
BUSINESSES ARE NOT INVESTING AS

486
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,164
MUCH AS BECAUSE THEY ARE

487
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:26,544
EXPECTING LESS.

488
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:28,080
LOWER EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE

489
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,483

EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE

491
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,720

IT'S AN INTERESTING DIVERGENCE

517
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,440
TO KEEP TRACK OF, ESPECIALLY AS

518
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,209
EVERYONE IS LOOKING FOR DATA TO

519
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:48,613
BACK UP THE FACT THE BREXIT VOTE

520
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,380
WAS TERRIBLE FOR ALL OF THE

521
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:49,781
ECONOMIES.

522
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:53,251
MATT: THOSE ARE COMPANIES THAT

523
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:54,052
EXPORT A LOT SO WHEN YOU SEE A

524
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,521
BIG DROP IN THE POUND, THAT'S

525
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:57,288
BENEFICIAL TO THOSE COMPANIES

526
00:25:57,288 --> 00:26:02,794
THAT WILL LOOK DIFFERENT.

00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:03,628
NONETHELESS, ECONOMIC SURPRISES

528
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:07,031

530
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,600
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FUNCTION I

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,367
HAVE ON THE BLOOMBERG.

532
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:13,338
RIGHT NOW, I HAVE GOT IT OPEN

533
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,339
FOR THE U.S. AND WE HAVE HAD A

534
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,409
LITTLE GREEN AT THE END.

535
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,310
THAT MEANS POSITIVE SURPRISES

536
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,345
RATHER THAN DISAPPOINTMENTS.

537
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:23,682
I WILL GO AHEAD AND BLOW UP THIS

538
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:24,115
CHART.

539

IT'S A MULTIYEAR LOOK GOING BACK

540
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:29,487
TO 2009 BUT IF I ZOOM IN ON 2015

541
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:34,492
AND 2016, YOU CAN SEE IN THE

542
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,326
SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WE HAVE

543
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:38,329

ECONOMIC SURPRISES.

545
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,666
IT'S A GREAT FUNCTION AND I

546
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:42,333
RECOMMEND YOU USE IT.

547
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,469
YOU CAN ASK YOUR SELF WHAT IS

548
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,270
GOING ON AFTER THE U.K. VOTED

549
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,471
FOR A BREXIT.

550
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:50,475
OLIVER: SO THAT IS A VERY SORT

551
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:55,713
OF DOMESTIC LOOKING FUNCTION FOR

552
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:56,514
THE U.K. AND WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,717
MULTINATIONAL STOCKS DOING WELL.

554
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,885
I WILL LOOK AT SOME MORE

DOMESTIC NUMBERS IN THE U.K.

556
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:05,390
THAT SUGGESTED MAYBE NOT JUST

557
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,090
LARGER COMPANIES TAKING

558
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:06,825
ADVANTAGE OF THE WEAKER POUND.

559
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,260
THIS IS RETAIL SALES IN THE U.K.

560
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:13,798
JAPAN AND PURPLE, CANADA IN

561
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,566
ORANGE.

562
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:18,703
THIS IS A PRETTY SOLID NUMBERS

563
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:19,103

CHINA SAYS THERE IS A TOURISM

689
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,539
DEFICIT.

690
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,208
CHINESE TOURISTS ARE SPENDING

691
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,378
MORE ABROAD.

692
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:44,148
IS THAT THE TOP LINE CASE?

693
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:48,119
WHAT IS CHINA SAYING ABOUT THAT?

694
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:48,985
>> THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT CHINA IS

695
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:49,654
SAYING.

696
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,156
CHINESE TOURISTS DO SPEND MORE

697
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,759
OUTSIDE OF CHINA THAN FOREIGN

698
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,793
TOURISTS.

699
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:59,730
THE QUESTION IS THE PACE.

700
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:04,869
IN 2013 CHINA REPORTED CHINESE

701
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,738
TOURISTS TRAVELING ABROAD SPENT

702
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,074
$100 BILLION OUTSIDE OF CHINA.

703
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,809
THAT HAS GONE UP TO $300

704
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:12,310
BILLION.

705
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,145
IT'S A SPECTACULAR RISE.

706
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,647
THAT'S ALMOST EQUAL TO THE FALL

707
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,282
IN CHINESE SPENDING ON

708
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:18,816
COMMODITIES.

709
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:23,387
MATT: THAT IS HUGE OUTFLOWS.

710
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,289
DOES THAT WORRY THE GOVERNMENT?

711
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,091
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE TRYING

712
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:27,825
TO GET THEIR MONEY OUT OF

713
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,627
CHINESE ASSETS.

714
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,929
>> THAT'S THE MOST LIKELY

715
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:32,396
EXPLANATION.

716
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,599
SOME OF THE INCREASE IN TOURIST

717
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,400
SPENDING IS CAPITAL OUTFLOWS.

718
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,436
THERE IS AN OFFSET.

719
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:42,073
THE OTHER IMPLICATION IS CHINA

720
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,275
IS RUNNING A BEER AND -- BIGGER

721
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:47,745
CURRENT ACCOUNT, A GOODS AND

722
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,547
SERVICES SURPLUS THAN IS

723
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,716
REPORTED SO IT HAS MORE CAPACITY

724
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,618
TO SUSTAIN.

725
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:57,555
SCARLET: WE HAVE A CHART THAT

726
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:58,522
EXPLAINS WHY IT IS SUSPICIOUS

727
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:03,627
DATA.

728
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:04,428
THEY ARE SHOWING THE NUMBERS

729
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,964
CHINA CLAIMS DON'T QUITE ADD UP.

730
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:14,605
>> THERE IS.

731
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,074
.

732
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,210
IN THE U.S. DATA IT IS UP BY 50%

733
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,111
WHICH IS REASONABLE.

734
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,346
THERE IS NO DOUBT THERE HAS BEEN

735
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,215
A STRONGER INCREASE IN JAPAN.

736
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,651
WHAT THE BIG DISCREPANCY IS IS

737
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:29,720
HONG KONG.

738
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,554
THERE IS TRADITIONALLY A LOT OF

739
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:32,523
CHINESE TOURISTS THAT GO TO HONG

740
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,457
KONG.

741
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:36,260
THEY DO NOT PROVIDE A BREAKDOWN

742
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:36,727
OF SPENDING.

743
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,563
SCARLET: THERE IS THE LINE AT

744
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:40,030
THE BOTTOM.

745
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,501
>> TOTAL SPENDING HAS FALLEN.

746
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:49,173
EVEN AS THEY REPORTED SPENDING

747
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,708
MORE.

748
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,779
HISTORICALLY 30-40% OF CHINESE

749
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,447
TOURISM HAS SHOWN UP OVER THE

750
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,816
PAST TWO YEARS THAT HAS GONE

751
00:36:58,816 --> 00:36:59,951
DOWN TO 10%.

752
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:00,751
IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

753
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:05,122
OLIVER: I WANT TO GET TO WHY

754
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:05,656
THIS MATTERS.

755
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,793
WHY THEY MAY BE FIGHTING THESE

756
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:09,560
NUMBERS YOU ARE CASTING DOUBT

757
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,228
ON.

758
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,030
YOU MENTIONED A GOOD SURPLUS.

759
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,367
ARE THEY BASICALLY SAYING

760
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,735
PERHAPS THERE IS MORE MONEY

761
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:21,872
GOING OUT THE A TOURISM?

762
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,174
PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MONEY

763
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:27,478
ELSEWHERE INSTEAD OF IN CHINA?

764
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:28,245
WHAT WAS THE MOTIVATION BE?

765
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:33,551
GUEST: I'M NOT CONVINCED IT IS A

766
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:37,788
CONSPIRATORIAL THING.

767
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,556
UNAMBIGUOUSLY AS CHINESE

768
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,391
INVESTMENT HAS SLOWED CHINESE

769
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,492
DEMAND FOR THE REST OF THE

770
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:44,595
WORLD'S GOODS HAS FALLEN.

771
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,031
YOU SEE CHINA IS SPENDING ON

772
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,167
IMPORTED COMMODITIES HAS TANKED.

773
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,671
THAT HAS HAD REVERBERATIONS

774
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,672
THROUGH THE REST OF THE WORLD.

775
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:59,577
IF THE TOURISM DATE IS REAL THEN

776
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,411
A LOT OF THE DECREASE IN CHINESE

777
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,680
SPENDING ON GOODS HAS BEEN

778
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,414
OFFSET BY INCREASED CHINESE

779
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:07,251
SPENDING BY CHINESE TOURISTS.

780
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:08,118
THE AGGREGATE IMPACT SHOULD NOT

781
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:11,322
BE THAT BAD.

782
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,189
IF IT IS CHINESE TOURISTS BUYING

783
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,191
FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT DOESN'T

784
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:14,725
GENERATE DEMAND.

785
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:19,396
THAT GENERATES A GLOBAL SAVING.

786
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:20,064
>> THAT WOULD BE CAPITAL

787
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:20,498
OUTFLOWS.

788
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:25,469
>> EXACTLY.

789
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:29,273
YOU CAN SEE DEMAND SETTING ASIDE

790
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,409
THE POSSIBILITY OF THE U.S. RATE

791
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:31,842
HIKE.

792
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:35,179
IN GENERAL DO NOT NEED MORE RATE

793
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,381
HIKE FOR NOW.

794
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:41,118
>> IT CHANGES THE NARRATIVE.

795
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:41,919
THE GOOD SURPLUS WOULD SUGGEST

796
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,121
THEY ARE GETTING MORE OF THE

797
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,057
THINGS THEY NEED DOMESTICALLY.

798
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:49,393
THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY IS STARTING

799
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,228
TO GROW WHICH IS WHAT THEY WANT

800
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,396
HIM A WHICH IS WHAT EVERYONE

801
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:56,133
WANTS.

802
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,001
IF THE TOURISM NUMBERS ARE RIGHT

803
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,571
MAY BE THEY ARE GETTING FOREIGN

804
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:01,906
PRODUCTS AND BRINGING IN FOREIGN

805
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,841
THINGS THROUGH OTHER MEANS.

806
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,776
>> THAT IS A POSSIBLE ARGUMENT.

807
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:11,015
THE HARD PART IS, YOU LOOK AT

808
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,284
INDICATORS.

809
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,218
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATCH UP ANY

810
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:14,852
BETTER.

811
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,887
IN GENERAL YES.

812
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:20,057
THERE IS A STORY ABOUT IMPORT

813
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,926
SUBSTITUTION.

814
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:26,263
MATT: THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THAT

815
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,331
SOSA SINGLY.

816
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,198
>> THE WAY THAT THAT IS NOT SO

817
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:29,900
BAD FOR THE WORLD IS A CHINESE

818
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,770
TOURISTS ARE SPENDING A LOT

819
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,337
OUTSIDE OF CHINA.

820
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:36,240
IF THEY ARE NOT THE POSITIVE

821
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,808
IMPACT FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD

822
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,110
IS WEAKER.

823
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:43,247
>> WHICH OF THESE DO YOU FEEL IS

824
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:47,251
THE MOST POSSIBLE?

825
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,286
>> SOME OF THE INCREASE IS REAL.

826
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:53,557
THERE HAS BEEN GROWTH IN CHINESE

827
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,459
TOURISM AND OTHER DESTINATIONS.

828
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,927
THAT INCREASE IS NOT BIG ENOUGH

829
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,431
TO EXPLAIN THE FULL GROWTH.

830
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,634
IN MEANINGFUL PART IS DISGUISED

831
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,669
CAPITAL OUTFLOWS.

832
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:06,771
THE MORE IMPORTANT ARAB --

833
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:07,638
IMPLICATION IS NOT THAT THERE IS

834
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,608
MONEY LEAVING CHINA.

835
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,410
CHINA IS PROVIDING LESS DEMAND

836
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,746
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.

837
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,849

838
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:19,717

THANK YOU.

00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,764
BELIEVE IN THE NUTRITIONAL

845

SUPPLEMENT COMPANY AND ADDS HE

846
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,401
NEVER GAVE JEFFRIES AN ORDER TO

847
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:40,704
SELL ANY SHARES.

848
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,505
THIS COMES IN RESPONSE TO BILL

849
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:42,973
ACKMAN.

850
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:47,978
HE HAS TAKEN THE OPPOSITE TRADE

851
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,113
BETTING AGAINST IT.

852
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:53,517
HE SENT THE STOCK DOWN AFTER

853
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,351
SAYING HE HAS TRIED TO SELL HIS

854
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,520
STAKE.

855
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,287
HE HAS SAID THAT IS NOT THE

856
00:40:57,287 --> 00:41:02,325
CASE.

857
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:04,428
HE HAD CLOSE DOWN A DOLLAR 43 AT

858
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,430
$60.50 A SHARE.

859
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,199
>> THAT IS PRETTY HUGE NEWS.

860
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,267
THIS WAS A BIG DEAL.

861
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,803
THE FACT THAT HE HAS BEEN

862
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,073
REFUTING THIS CLAIM SAYING HE IS

863
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:16,874
NOT ONLY NOT SELLING BUT ADDING

864
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,176
IS PRETTY BIG IN THE MARKET

865
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,545
MOVE.

866
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:24,715
HE CANNOT CATCH A BREAK.

867
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:25,582
>> I'M LOOKING AT A THREE-DAY

868
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:27,918
CHART ON MY BLOOMBERG.

869

WE HAD A DROP FROM $62 DOWN TO

58.

874
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,836
ESSENTIALLY WHAT HE IS SAYING IS

875
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,837
HE HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THAT

876
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,739
DROP.

877
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:55,679
2.3 MILLION SHARES.
