a lot of these arts and literature examples like what Jane Austen can teach us about risk yes like what can Jane Austen teach us about Repsol so it turns out the problem facing most of the characters in Jane Austen novels and Anthony Trollope novels which is what I do for the risk management chapter is a risk management problem right so if you think about their marriage market in the nineteenth century novels basically you have these suitors who come by and you have a young woman who's in a very very risky position so it's amazing how much she talks about the risk of being in that position and then what's really fun is in the trollop book he actually uses options and diversification as logics for how you can manage that so it's you know in a way to the problems of Finance are the problems of life I can't imagine growth is a problem of life insurance there's a problem of life so in a way once you think about it that way it doesn't become so esoteric it becomes you know the stuff of our lives right seems like a lot of the risks that are described in the book are non-financial risks that can't be financialized that finance can't fix well so some of them I mean students can help okay right I mean so the point of the marriage market example is not to say that finance is going to help a woman whose face in the marriage market in the wrecking country the point is if you want to understand what's management did you want understand auctions if you want understand diversification yeah this is like a much easier way into understanding that
