governor jay Inslee of Washington one of several states that suing the truck ministration over its immigration crackdown governor Inslee wrote a letter to the administration today some by five other Democratic governors seeking information about the children still separated from their parents and I want to start with what I thought was the most alarming part of your letter and and something that I had not heard before and it though it jives a little bit with what the arguments we've heard for the administration in court you write the following in a meeting with the governor's offices on June 29th 2018 Trump administration representatives shared that reunification may include the placement of separated children with any long-term sponsor regardless of whether that placement is with their parents another family member residing in the US a family member signing their home country or in long term foster care setting are you saying that trouble administration told you that they can place a child separated from parents in long-term foster care and count that as reunification yes and perhaps we should not be surprised this whole indignant and traumatic episode was based on young humanity at the beginning it was based on deceit in the middle and now it's based on incompetence these people have no idea what they're doing I've seen coat check windows operate with a better system and now on top of that incompetence the secretary told us on a on a conference call that they do not have an intention to reunify these children with their parents they're gonna call it good if they can find anybody else who could serve as a foster parent or might have some familial relationship and these kids don't even know these strangers we've got to understand the depth of depravity of this president this was a system designed to be cruel and it has continued to be cruel and there does and their continued design is not to follow this judicial order you've seen it when they when they told this yesterday they were going to comply with this order of five-year-olds and now today they admitted that they would not and they'd have no clue to do it now what is so disturbing to me is we have seen this movie over and over with this bunch we saw it when we Sudan the Muslim ban we're seeing it now when they're trying to take away our grants to fight crime the way they're trying to take away our money to fight crime on the bird grant on the the burn grants they're trying to take that money away from us they're not trying to help local communities to fight crime and then they're so in company can run a two car funeral and so this is par for the course with them and that's why we have to remain entirely dedicated we have to stay on them every single day the price of protection from the depredations that Donald Trump is eternal vigilant and I'm glad my state has sued them again on this we'll be suing them again on this burn grant thing in the future near future so it's clear they do not intend to be humane they will continue on this course until he is removed from office and by the way at the upshot of the show you talked about the consequences of this I'll tell you what he's gonna lose this November he's gonna lose seats this November because people are outraged by this traumatic abuse of these children I want to make sure I want to just come back because I do want to make sure I understand this I I get um a lot of emails viewers of the show and there's been kind of a conspiracy theory that has sort of floated out there they're gonna take these kids away they're gonna put them up for adoption and I've even written back some people say there's no evidence of that I really don't think that's the case but but what you are saying is that you as a governor your staff in calls with officials they told communicated to you that they viewed placement in long term foster care as equivalent to reunifying with a parent correct and that's why we wrote the letter to him calling him on it and they have not responded which is also typical of them we would think that the federal government would communicate with governor's we've written them repeated letters on this subject and they've ignored them all so we called him on it and we should all be alarmed by this look a five-year-old who's never met a foster parent and we know there's good foster parents but they ought to have their mothers and mothers ought to have their children and this is a continuation of their I have to call it diabolical I don't know what else to call it in order to use these kids as hostages to try to get his wall and force his wall that's what these children were used for and he's continuing to do it so I'm glad that we are continuing to beat the drammen shine the harsh light of truth on this abusive behavior because only that will succeed in reigning in this rogue president we have to be diligent on this and I'm glad my state is doing that by the way we've also helping these parents we are now my state and this is why it's important to have Democratic governors my state is actually helping provide legal attorneys for these kids so that they can get into court to enforce their rights that's the right thing to do it's not just congressmen and Senators it's governors and that's why I'm glad we're gonna like some Democratic governors this year as well well let me ask you a final question on the politics this you heard senator Hirono saying that she thought the backlash is bigger than the provocation as it were what is your read of this well I've been in politics for 25 years off and on and I can tell you that I have never seen an issue of any dimension that have touched so many human hearts I have never seen people coming up to me saying they're losing sleep over this subject and asking what they can do I've gone through the Vietnam War the Civil Rights this thing touched where people live because every parent who was separated for ten minutes looking for their child in a shopping mall knows the terror this provokes and you know who else knows that is Donald Trump that's why he tried to use this as a weapon of of terror he understands that concern and that's why Americans Republicans independents Democrats whatever you are people understood how horrific this was and that is gonna translate into people coming to vote because ultimately that's what we need to do right now I've had dozens of people say what week what can we do about this go vote and find somebody else to bring with you to vote this year that's how we restrain this president all
