the other top story tonight President Donald Trump's fixation on the upper echelon of federal law enforcement and what it now means in what remains the criminal obstruction case looking at his conduct as well as others in the White House James call meas memos have revealed in more stark detail than we've ever seen from contemporaneous notes not what people say later what he wrote at the time they revealed Trump obsessed with high-ranking officials in the FBI and the DOJ and that it started earlier and ran much deeper than many people knew these memos show donald trump for example explicitly concerned about guess who rod Rosenstein who would go on to be Muller's boss well he was looking at Rosen side from the very beginning back when he was just a nominee for Deputy Attorney General memos show that Trump was asking combing about how Republicans were holding up Rosen Stein's nomination memos also depict Trump as very curious about Barack Obama's two attorneys General Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch asking call me to even compare the two the Comey Lynch relationship generates questions to this day it seems to me like with Loretta Lynch you worried very much about what misinformed people we're going to say about her that they were that there was no true reason to have concerns about Loretta Lynch's integrity with that investigation but misinformed people would get the wrong idea and you took action to account for that rather than the truth well maybe in a slight sense that was one of the bricks in the load that led me to believe that if I do the announcement next to Loretta it won't have credibility I've already spoken about that so I won't get into it right now on the Trump side of things we get a fuller picture of Trump's reported quest to obtain something inappropriate personal loyalty from the FBI director and of course we've heard about some of that but the memos in more contemporary nice details show Trump testing Comey in several different ways asking for example was he following the political tweets from Donald Trump and was he following White House press briefings which is bizarre if he was working during the day we also learned it was not just Trump asking Comey to let Michael Flynn go it was also Trump's chief of staff asking about Flint was he asking of Mike Flynn is currently under surveillance or if Mike Flynn is under under a very serious form of investigation do you know what he was getting out by asking you that not for sure I think he was asking is there current electronic surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of the National Security Adviser mm-hmm and you did give him an answer correct Trump fired Comey and he said it was over Russia now later there was of course commis deputy Andrew McCabe who was run out of the DOJ and one of the most unusual firings ever we've reported on that but there is so much more now in these memos that come that came out last night Comey is depicting Trump is obsessed with McCabe in January 2017 he asked if McKay would have a problem working with Trump because Trump had so viciously publicly attacked him during the campaign and in February Trump asked if McCabe knew about his attacks on him during the campaign so he's trying to keep up with all that then in March again at the end of an unrelated conversation Trump mentions that he hadn't brought up McCabe during the conversation which is a way of bringing up and then saying well he trusts commis view backing up McCabe now Comey calls Trump's takedown of his former number two as shameful are you concerned there's been an orchestrated campaign to target you and other people who could corroborate your testimony as witnesses there's certainly been an organized campaign to target me there was definitely an organized campaign to attack Andy McCabe and urge his firing tear down his reputation attack his wife just shameful attacks from the president directly just shameful according to Comey of course the news is broken that Andrew McCabe is actually through the Trump Justice Department facing a criminal referral meaning a witness to potential obstruction by Trump could himself become a target you take this all together put aside some of the other stuff we have reported it's newsworthy but in this breakdown you'll notice some of the things I didn't mention about the memos and look at the picture that James Comey was writing far before he knew that he'd be fired or that there be a bob mullet or any you know Donald Trump's critics often depict him as clueless or even demented these memos written from inside the room they show something else they cast Donald Trump as canny and sophisticated and detail-oriented if albeit perhaps paranoid and they cast him as someone who does not respect the rule of law and who is hell-bent on squashing any potential legal threat from inside the DOJ that is something worth keeping in mind as more evidence comes out in this open probe hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click
