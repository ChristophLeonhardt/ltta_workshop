A MAN PERSONALLY DELIVERED HORSE SHIT IN A GIFTWRAPPED PACKAGE TO STEVEN MNUCHIN'S HOUSE THIS YEAR AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT TO REPAY THE TREASURY SECRETARY FOR THE NEW TAX LAW. HE ENCLOSED A NICE LITTLE LETTER TO HIM SAYING HEY STEVIE, WE ARE RETURNING THE GIFT OF THE CHRISTMAS TAX BILL, IT'S BULLSHIT. THIS CAME FROM ROBBY STRONG, AND HE WROTE, WARMEST WISHES, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS A PICTURE OF ROBBY STRONG WHO ADMITTEDLY SENT THE MANURE ON FACEBOOK STRONG WROTE HE CONTINUED HIS INTERVIEWS TO OTHER NEWS OUTLETS, IN ONE HE SAID HE WAS LIKE JESUS. I WILL READ HIS QUOTE HE SAID THAT HE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT BEING ARRESTED, HE DOESN'T THINK IT'S ILLEGAL TO DELIVER MANURE TO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE, AND ACCORDING TO ONE OFFICIAL, IF THE GIFT DOESN'T PRESENT ANY DANGER HE MIGHT NOT GET ARRESTED FOR IT. HE HASN'T BEEN ARRESTED THUS FAR, AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT NOT FACE ANY CHARGES FOR THIS ACT, HE'S JUST GETTING DEATH THREATS ONLINE BUT THAT'S HOW THE INTERNET WORKS. LOOK, HE'S A FUNNY GUY AND I THINK HE DID THIS IN THE RIGHT SPIRIT, BUT I'M GOING TO BE A LITTLE BAH HUMBUG ABOUT IT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT. BECAUSE GOING TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES IS A DIFFERENT LAYER. THEN EVERYBODY IS SHOWING UP EVERYBODY'S HOUSE WAS SHIT, AND AT SOME POINT IT'S WENT TO HIT THE FAN. AND IN THE CASE OF MANURE, SOMETIMES THEY USE MANURE FOR EXPLOSIVES, THAT'S WHY THE COPS HAD TO BE SUPER CAREFUL AND DUMP IT ALL OVER THE PLACE, WHICH ACTUALLY LED TO THE FUNNIEST QUOTE, THE WINTER WERE OF ZSA ZSA GABOR SAID WE HAVE $50 MILLION HOMES AND WE CAN'T MOVE, THEY HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY. I WOULDN'T HAVE PHRASED IT THAT WAY TO THE PRESS. I THINK YOU WILL BE OKAY AND YOUR $50 MILLION HOME FOR A LITTLE LONGER. BUT DON'T GO TO PEOPLE'S HOUSE. I LIKE THAT IT'S NO SUBTERFUGE, HE WAS LIKE, THIS IS ME, I'M NOT A TROLL, I DON'T HAVE ANY BAD INTENT, I WANT TO POINT OUT THE TAX BILL IS BULLSHIT BUT STILL, I WOULD HAVE COUNSELED AGAINST IT. I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM GOING TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE, BUT I'M KIND OF GLAD THAT HE DID IT WITH THE SHIT. THAT'S A GUY WHO WANTED TO USE THE GOVERNMENT PLANE FOR A PERSONAL TRIP, RIGHT? THE ONE WHO IS WITH THE ACTRESS, THEY WANTED THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE GET FED UP. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE SHITTING ON, AND NOW THE PEOPLE YOU ARE SHITTING ON ARE TAKING THE SHIT BACK TO YOUR HOUSE. I DON'T THINK IT'S COOL TO SHOW UP TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE FAMILIES WHO AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING, BUT I DEFINITELY THINK IT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT EVERYBODY IS ACCESSIBLE AT THIS POINT, YOUR ADDRESS IS ONLINE, AND YOU HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW YOU TREAT PEOPLE BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE IS 100% AND SOMEONE MIGHT SHOW UP AT YOUR HOUSE WITH A BOX OF SHIT. HE SAID THIS IS HIS FORM OF PROTEST, WE'VE BEEN SO JADED TOWARD PROTESTS AND THIS IS HIS WAY OF BRINGING ATTENTION TO SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT, THIS TAX BILL THAT IS SCREWING OVER AMERICANS, I'M WITH HIM ON THAT, BUT DON'T GO TO ANYONE' IS HOUSE, DON'T DELIVER SHIT TO ANYONE. WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH. I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD PHRASE IT THAT WAY. LAST THING ON THIS, HE SHOWS UP WITH SHIT, I'M WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE SHOWING UP WITH OTHER STUFF. WASHINGTON THINKS WE ARE THE RADICAL LEFT, YOU WILL FIND THAT WE ARE THE MODERATES. THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH PITCHFORKS BEHIND US. AND SOME WAS SHIT FORKS. AIDA IS RIGHT, THEY ARE PUSHING PEOPLE TOO FAR, BUT DON'T GO TO SOMEONE' IS HOUSE. THAT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER.
