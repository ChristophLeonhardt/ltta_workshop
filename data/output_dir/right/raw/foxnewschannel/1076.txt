1
00:00:02,594 --> 00:00:02,927
GATHER.

2
00:00:02,927 --> 00:00:06,131
CONNOR POWELL IS LIVE ON THE

3
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:06,931
BORDER.

4
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:07,565
CONNOR.

5
00:00:07,565 --> 00:00:08,967
>> Reporter: NEARLY THREE MONTHS

6
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,535
OF THE WEEKLY PROTEST.

7
00:00:10,535 --> 00:00:12,137
THE QUESTION IS WILL THIS

8
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,538
CONTINUE TO ESCALATE.

9
00:00:13,538 --> 00:00:24,482
WE SAW VIOLENT CLASHES WHERE 60

10
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,984
PALESTINIANS WERE KILLED AND

11
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,386
THERE HAVE BEEN CLASHES AND

12
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:35,160
SEVERAL MOLOTOV COCKTAILS AND

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,828
THERE'S BEEN MANY INJURED BUT

14
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,797
WE'VE SEEN SMALLER GROUPS OF

15
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:41,299
PEOPLE ALONG THE BORDER.

16
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:42,734
THERE'S NOT BEEN THE VIOLENCE

17
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:44,269
WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY BUT THE BIG

18
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:45,403
CHANGES IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS

19
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:49,107
IS THE MILITANTS IN GAZA ARE

20
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:51,543
USING KITES ON FIRE AND SENDING

21
00:00:51,543 --> 00:00:54,512
THEM ACROSS THE BORDER TO START

22
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,981
FIRES IN THESE FIELDS.

23
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:58,917
IT'S DONE A LOT OF DAMAGE TO

24
00:00:58,917 --> 00:00:59,484
ISRAELI FIELDS.

25
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:02,687
THE REASON IT'S SIGNIFICANT IS

26
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:06,324
WE SAW ROCKET FIRE COMING FROM

27
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:06,624
GAZA.

28
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:07,826
THESE DIFFICULTS ARE MORE

29
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:09,727
DIFFICULT TO CONTROL WHERE THEY

30
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:10,995
LAND AND TAKE OFF.

31
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:13,832
IT'S A BIG CHANGE IN TERMS OF

32
00:01:13,832 --> 00:00:00,000
TACTICS BY THE MILITANTS IN GAZA
