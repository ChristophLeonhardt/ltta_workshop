1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,020
I was born in Iran.

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,739
I've witnessed ballistic missiles
coming

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,330
down;

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,309
that make me think that OK what are

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,659
the things that I would like to
change.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,489
What are the things that they would
like to impact them at the

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,970
end of the day. I think we'd need to
be responsible

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,800
for using any technology

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,300
in a positive fashion.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,999
If there's anyone out there that
could steer the

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,889
thrust of technology away

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,209
from our own demise

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,099
and toward the betterment of
humanity

14
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,260
this could be the guy.

15
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,135
My name is Ali Hajimiri.

16
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,509
I'm an educator

17
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,610
and an engineer

18
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,906
and an inventor.

19
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,899
Since a very young age I was really
curious to find out how things

20
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,060
work. Any kind of toy I had a

21
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,940
you know within a couple of days

22
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,629
it was ripped apart

23
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,280
and open

24
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,389
and torn into pieces.

25
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,219
And you know my parents were not a
huge fan

26
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,689
of that throughout the process.

27
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,080
I tried to then build things myself.

28
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,669
At some point I tried to make a
laser when I was

29
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,950
I think like 10 or 11

30
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,893
and I didn't succeed.

31
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,369
But Hajimiri made up for that
failure

32
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,530
in his adult life.

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,939
Today he holds more than 90 issued

34
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,869
patents and along

35
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,509
with his tenure at Caltech carries a
reputation

36
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,549
of making ideas that would otherwise
sound

37
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,142
like science fiction a reality.

38
00:01:18,143 --> 00:01:20,059
Things that I work on

39
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,949
are some of the inventions

40
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,049
if you will, that I've been involved

41
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,204
in, they span a large gamut lensless

42
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,919
cameras lensless projectors

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,230
and 3-D cameras,

44
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,730
radar on a chip,

45
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,199
self-heating circuits hand-held

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,539
diagnostic devices wireless power
transfer

47
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,270
space based solar power.

48
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,739
They may appear kind of seemingly
unrelated

49
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,719
to each other but they all rely on

50
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,510
this underlying concept

51
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,860
of a phase arrays.

52
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,840
The phase arrays is basically

53
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,129
a large number of small

54
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,620
elements working together.

55
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,179
Hajimiri's inspiration for phased
array technology

56
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,270
comes from an unlikely place-

57
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,680
ants.

58
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,669
As a child took a big jar of

59
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,496
glass jar and I

60
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:03,389
was digging through an ant ant hill,

61
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,399
and then I took a whole bunch

62
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,700
of ants and just dumped them in that
jar.

63
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,719
And within a couple of days they
started

64
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,653
building the whole nest.

65
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,039
It was really amazing because it
showed

66
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,139
how you can achieve very complex

67
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,179
things through interactions

68
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,660
of simple units.

69
00:02:21,162 --> 00:02:23,039
The phased arrays is basically the
army

70
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,900
of ants.

71
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,436
Now instead of ants carrying dirt.
imagine

72
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,369
millions of tiny signals working

73
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,060
in concert to send energy
wirelessly.

74
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,109
This array system is the basis

75
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,309
for Hajimiri's latest

76
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,160
and most ambitious project-

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,389
collecting solar power in outer
space

78
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,210
and beaming it down to earth.

79
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,339
We are in the wireless power
transfer laboratory

80
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,259
and we are looking at

81
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,969
is set up for demonstration

82
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,039
and testing of have wireless

83
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,320
power transfer.

84
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,609
Here you have a small

85
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,859
version of what would be collecting

86
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,959
power. We are basically creating

87
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,170
a beam and focusing of the energy

88
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,380
in this location,

89
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,569
and what you can see is that the
energy is

90
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,200
being transferred wirelessly

91
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,220
and this would be the unit building
block

92
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,671
making the space-based

93
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,210
generator power station.

94
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,349
This is an extremely important thing
because

95
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,419
first of all it gives access
globally

96
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,799
to energy and power.

97
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,929
It doesn't introduce any greenhouse

98
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,579
gases or any of that sort.

99
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,610
In the process of making up the
energy.

100
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,689
But the idea of sending power to
Earth

101
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,669
from space has some pretty high

102
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,079
profile detractors.

103
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,160
Space Solar Power.

104
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,770
OK. The stupidest thing ever.

105
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,739
Skeptics like Elon Musk believe

106
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,509
that after multiple power
conversions

107
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,880
and the cost of launches

108
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,830
and the sheer scale of such a
project

109
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,339
makes it far too expensive

110
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,229
and inefficient forever trapping it
within

111
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,350
the confines of science fiction.

112
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,850
And if anybody

113
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:50,540
should think, should like space
solar it should be me.

114
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,290
All right? I've got to go to rocket
company

115
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,460
and a solar company.

116
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,709
But this is of little concern to a
man

117
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,079
who has made his living defying
conventional

118
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,820
wisdom.

119
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,079
He believes that the greatest
innovations

120
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,960
come from an active imagination.

121
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,519
A lot of us are inspired by science

122
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,349
fiction I think science fiction is

123
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,719
essential to the way of thinking
about

124
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,769
making useful

125
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,200
and interesting things.

126
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,518
You start with a concept that

127
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,919
doesn't exist that could have been
articulated

128
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,930
in science fiction

129
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,979
and you trying to see what can you

130
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,759
do about that.

131
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,349
Can you do it in its entirety.

132
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,020
Can you do a variation of that

133
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,759
and that process that's part of the
creative process

134
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,589
right. I mean engineering

135
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,920
is that discipline of creativity.

136
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,119
The key question is that how

137
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,039
can you make it in such a way that
it's

138
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,939
feasible

139
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,370
and also economical

140
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,579
and to do that you have to take

141
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,459
a lot of different kinds of
technologies

142
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,617
and bring them together.

143
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,529
Like an army of ants all

144
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,689
working together at the unlikely

145
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,840
intersection of science fiction

146
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,227
and reality.

147
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:53,596
You

148
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:57,309
know nothing is done in isolation.

149
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,549
No one person really.

150
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,579
And today I think ever was doing

151
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,499
things by themselves. You know

152
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,930
if you want to go fast

153
00:05:04,510 --> 00:00:00,000
go alone if you want to go far take
your
