ARTHEL: AS WE MARK NATIONAL CANCER SURVIVOR'S DAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PUTTING THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE VAST NUMBER OF AMERICANS FIGHTING THE DEADLY DISEASE. THE PRESIDENT SAYS IN A STATEMENT, QUOTE, TO PROVIDE AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES, I RECENTLY SIGNED INTO LAW THE FEDERAL RIGHT TO TRY LEGISLATION. THIS NEW LAW GIVES THOSE FACING A TERMINAL ILLNESS EXPANDED OPTIONS FOR CARE AND TREATMENT THAT COULD SAVE THEIR LIVES. MY NEXT GUEST IS A CANCER SURVIVOR HERSELF AND SHE HAS ACCEPTED THE NOMINATION TO BE A 2018 WOMAN OF THE YEAR CANDIDATE FOR THE LEUKEMIA AND LYMPHOMA SOCIETY AND SHE IS JOINING ME NOW OVER THE PHONE FROM LOS ANGELES. HER NAME IS KATLYN LINDSEY. ARE YOU THERE? I AM. HELLO, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME ON. ARTHEL: I WANT TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW YOU'RE MY DEAR FRIEND AS WELL. I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU. YOU ARE ONE OF 20 CANDIDATES WHICH IS WHY YOU STARTED YOUR FUND RAISING CAMPAIGN. TELL US ABOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN, YOUR GOAL AND WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE HOPING TO ACHIEVE AS A NOMINEE? IT'S A COMPETITION TO SUPPORT CANCER RESEARCH AND TO HELP EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN TOUCHED OR WILL BE TOUCHED BY CANCER, ANY CANCER, AND IT'S 20 CANDIDATES, A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN. IT TIES TO ME BECAUSE I HAD BREAST CANCER. IT WAS DIAGNOSED ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO. AND I UNDERWENT A MASTECTOMY AND WENT BACK TO MY LIFE. MARCH 8th OF THIS YEAR I FOUND OUT THE BREAST CANCER CAME BACK AND THIS IS RIGHT BEFORE MY CAMPAIGN KICKED OFF. RESEARCH IS SO IMPORTANT. MY CASE IS SO RARE, DUE TO MY AGE. BUT THERE'S BREAKTHROUGHS IN IMMUNOTHERAPY AND WE'RE IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PATIENTS AND FOR CAREGIVERS. I THINK THEY HAVE INVESTED OVER $1.2 BILLION I THINK IN RESEARCH. ARTHEL: HOW MUCH HAVE YOU RAISED, KATLYN, SO FAR? MY GOAL FOR THE END OF THE WEEK IS TO HAVE $100,000 AND I'M VERY, VERY CLOSE TO THAT. ARTHEL: YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO THAT. WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW? LAST I READ YOU WERE AT $90,000. IT'S A BLIND COMPETITION. WE CAN'T PUBLICLY SAY HOW MUCH I'VE RAISED. I'M VERY CLOSE TO THAT NUMBER. ARTHEL: WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE. IF YOU WANT TO DONATE, KATLYN'S WEBSITE IS MWO Y.ORG, MWOY.ORG. LOOK FOR HER NAME, KATLYN LINDSEY. AND HER PICTURE. TO DONATE. KATLYN, IS THERE A DEADLINE TO DONATE? IT WOULD BE END OF THIS WEEK. SO FRIDAY. ARTHEL: FRIDAY. OKAY. WE'LL DEFINITELY GO TOWARDS THAT GOAL FOR SURE AND WE'RE GOING TO SURPASS IT. I WANT TO BACK UP, KATLYN. YOU STARTED TELLING YOUR STORY BUT I WANT TO SLOW IT DOWN AND REMIND EVERYBODY YOUR STORY, THE BACK STORY IS THAT IN MARCH OF 2015 AT 32 YEARS OLD YOU WERE DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE 2 BREAST CANCER. YOU HAD A MASTECTOMY FOLLOWED BY EIGHT RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERIES AND MULTIPLE PROCEDURES. THEN YOU WERE GIVEN THE ALL-CLEAR. THEN THREE YEARS LATER, MARCH OF THIS YEAR, 2018, YOU FOUND OUT THAT YOUR BREAST CANCER HAD COME BACK. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? ALL MY DOCTORS WERE IN SHOCK BECAUSE A AFTER A MASTECTOMY IT ISN'T LIKELY THAT CANCER WILL RETURN ON THE MASTECTOMY SIDE BUT FOR ME IT DID AND THEY ADMITTEDLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MORE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE DONE ESPECIALLY ON CASES LIKE MINE. SO THE FIRST TIME I DIDN'T UNDERGO RADIATION. THIS TIME I'M CURRENTLY UNDERGOING 25 ROUNDS OF RADIATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GOT ALL THE CELLS. SO I'M IN THE PROCESS OF THAT TREATMENT RIGHT NOW AND I'M TAKING IT DAY BY DAY, BUT ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS WITH THIS IS THAT WHAT I LEARNED WAS WHAT ORIGINALLY WAS DISCOVERED THROUGH BLOOD CANCER RESEARCH, SINCE BLOOD CANCER IS EASY TO STUDY, IS NOW BEING TESTED FOR CLINICAL TRIALS FOR OTHER CANCER AS WELL. SO THAT'S WHY THIS ISN'T JUST FOR ME WITH BREAST CANCER OR FOR LEUKEMIA OR LYMPHOMA. IT AFFECTS EVERY TYPE OF CANCER AND EVERY PERSON. ARTHEL: I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR MAYBE 20 YEARS NOW. YOU KNOW I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS REMARKABLE AND IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT YOU, THE WAY YOU WERE RAISED, AND YOUR FORTTITUDE AND COMPASSION AND YOU AS A PERSON. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND KEEP FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT AND WE'RE ON YOUR SIDE.
