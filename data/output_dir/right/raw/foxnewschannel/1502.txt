1
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:02,886
INTELLIGENCE, NOT THE SPIN

2
00:00:02,886 --> 00:00:04,154
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE

3
00:00:04,154 --> 00:00:05,522
WAS SPYING, MARTHA.

4
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:06,823
>> ED, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

5
00:00:06,823 --> 00:00:08,025
SO MY NEXT GUEST SAYS THAT

6
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:09,126
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ACTING

7
00:00:09,126 --> 00:00:11,194
LIKE A DICTATOR FOR TELLING

8
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:12,229
THE DOJ TO LOOK INTO THE

9
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:12,963
REPORTS OF SURVEILLANCE OF

10
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:15,866
HIS CAMPAIGN.

11
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:19,269
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ERIC

12
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,137
SWALWELL JOINS ME TONIGHT.

13
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:23,173
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME

14
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:23,540
BACK.

15
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,241
>> Martha: THANKS FOR COMING

16
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:24,541
BACK.

17
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:25,509
I APPRECIATE IT ONE OF THE

18
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:26,877
QUESTIONS I HAVE, WHEN JAMES

19
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:27,878
CLAPPER GOES OUT AND TALKS

20
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:28,679
ABOUT ALL OF THE CONCERNS

21
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,047
THAT THEY HAD, THAT THERE

22
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:31,548
WERE CONTACTS AND HE NOW

23
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:32,549
SAYS HE IS ABSOLUTELY

24
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,685
POSITIVE THAT THE RUSSIANS

25
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:38,121
SOMEHOW SWUNG THE U.S.

26
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,324
ELECTION, WHY DID THEY NOT?

27
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:41,458
BECAUSE IT WAS CONSIDERED AT

28
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,960
ONE POINT, ANDREW MCCABE WAS

29
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,860
IN THE ROOM.

30
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,828
JAMES COMEY WAS IN THE ROOM

31
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:45,896
ACCORDING TO THESE REPORTS.

32
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:47,064
WHY DID THEY NOT DO WHAT

33
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:48,332
THEY CALL A DEFENSIVE

34
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:49,266
BRIEFING IF THEY WERE SO

35
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:49,933
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE

36
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,234
OF THE ELECTION, WHY DIDN'T

37
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:52,469
THEY GET IN TOUCH WITH THE

38
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,870
CAMPAIGN AND SAY, LOOK, WE

39
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:54,638
THINK THEY'RE REACHING OUT

40
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,539
TO YOUR FOLKS?

41
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,007
>> I'M NOT SUGGESTING,

42
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:58,008
MARTHA, THAT THEY DID

43
00:00:58,008 --> 00:00:58,942
EVERYTHING RIGHT AND THAT'S

44
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:01,645
WHY I HAVE CALLED FOR AN

45
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,046
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION.

46
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:04,181
I WROTE LEGISLATION SO WE

47
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:05,048
CAN TELL THE AMERICAN

48
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:07,451
PEOPLE, IN PART, WHETHER THE

49
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:08,285
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE WAS

50
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:08,652
ADEQUATE.

51
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,787
I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT

52
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:11,455
THERE WERE MANY RED FLAGS

53
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:13,023
THAT WERE MISSED AND JUST TO

54
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:14,625
PUT THIS IN CON TEXAS

55
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,392
THOUGH, DONALD TRUMP WAS

56
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:16,393
ALSO TELLING THE AMERICAN

57
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:17,428
PEOPLE THAT THE ELECTION WAS

58
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:19,430
GOING TO BE RIGGED AND

59
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,366
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS HAVE

60
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:22,866
ACKNOWLEDGED.

61
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:23,367
>> Martha: HOW SO?

62
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:26,336
>> THAT PLAYED INTO THEIR

63
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,104
DECISION AS TO WHETHER TO

64
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:27,938
TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

65
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:28,872
WHAT THE RUSSIANS WERE

66
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:29,206
DOING.

67
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:30,507
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY

68
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,575
INTO THAT FALSE NARRATIVE

69
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:33,143
DONALD TRUMP WAS PEDDLING.

70
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:33,744
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS

71
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:34,044
RIGHT.

72
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:35,045
THAT WAS THE WRONG CALL ON

73
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:36,180
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

74
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,780
>> Martha: YOU KNOW, IF

75
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,581
HILLARY CLINTON, WHO SAYS

76
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:40,050
THAT SHE BELIEVES THAT THE

77
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,185
RUSSIANS STOLE THE ELECTION

78
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,886
FROM HER, THEN SHE MUST BE

79
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:44,121
PRETTY ANGRY AT THE

80
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:46,757
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.

81
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:47,958
AND IF THEY HAD STEPPED IN

82
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,427
AND DONE WHAT THEY, YOU

83
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:51,295
KNOW, PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE

84
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:54,031
DONE, WOULDN'T THIS HAVE

85
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:54,766
GONE DIFFERENT HAVE ANY IT

86
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:55,900
RAISES THE QUESTION, JAMES

87
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,968
COMEY SAYS HE WANT TO SHARE

88
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:57,802
THE DOSSIER WITH THE

89
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:59,771
PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE WAS

90
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:00,505
GENUINELY CONCERNED THAT IT

91
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:02,540
COULD BE USED AS SOME SORT

92
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,409
OF COME

93
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:04,475
OF KOME

94
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:04,943
OF KOMPROMAT.

95
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:07,979
WHY DID NOT EARLIER IN THE

96
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:08,312
PROCESS.

97
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:09,047
IF THEY WERE CONCERNED THEY

98
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:09,781
HAD SOMETHING IN THIS

99
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:10,949
CAMPAIGN OVER THIS

100
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,016
CANDIDATE, IT MAKES NO SENSE

101
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:12,851
THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE

102
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:13,284
BRIEFED THEM.

103
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:14,919
>> I AGREE.

104
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,520
>> Martha: ALL RIGHT.

105
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,788
SO WHY DO YOU THINK THEY

106
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:17,121
DIDN'T?

107
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:17,589
>> I DON'T KNOW.

108
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:18,590
I THINK AN INDEPENDENT

109
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,457
COMMISSION THOUGH WOULD HAVE

110
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:20,592
TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

111
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:21,826
THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO

112
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:23,795
LATE TO DO IT.

113
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:24,596
SEPTEMBER 11TH, COMMISSION

114
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:25,763
WAS ABLE TO ANSWER A LOT OF

115
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:27,065
THE QUESTIONS LIKE THIS.

116
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:28,099
THAT COMMISSION WAS NOT PUT

117
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:29,534
IN PLACE ON SEPTEMBER 12TH.

118
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:31,202
IT TOOK A YEAR AFTER THE

119
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:31,536
ATTACK.

120
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:32,770
THERE IS STILL TIME.

121
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,538
>> Martha: HERE IS WHAT WE

122
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:34,072
DO KNOW.

123
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,206
JAMES COMEY HAS SAID THAT

124
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,174
THEY WERE CONVINCED THAT

125
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:38,209
HILLARY CLINTON WAS GOING TO

126
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:39,143
WIN.

127
00:02:39,143 --> 00:02:40,078
SO, IF THEY'RE CONVINCED

128
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:40,678
THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS

129
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:41,613
GOING TO WIN, THEY ARE

130
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:42,981
TALKING ABOUT HER, THE

131
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,816
INVESTIGATION INTO HER QUITE

132
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:45,550
OFTEN DURING THE COURSE OF

133
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,351
THIS TIME.

134
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:48,052
AND, YET, THEY DON'T TALK TO

135
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,854
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ABOUT

136
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:50,688
WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

137
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:53,558
IN THAT CAMPAIGN, IS IT

138
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:54,292
POSSIBLY BECAUSE THEY WANT

139
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:56,161
TO KEEP A WINDOW OPEN TO

140
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:56,895
THAT CAMPAIGN?

141
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:57,862
THEY HAVE GOT SOME

142
00:02:57,862 --> 00:02:58,696
INTELLIGENCE COMING OUT OF

143
00:02:58,696 --> 00:02:59,697
THAT CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THEY

144
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:01,199
HAVEN'T MADE THEM AWARE OF

145
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,567
THE FULL SITUATION AND,

146
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:04,135
PERHAPS, THAT MIGHT BE THE

147
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:06,938
REASON, DO YOU THINK, THAT

148
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:09,207
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE

149
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:09,941
TRANSPARENT WITH THE HEAD OF

150
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:10,375
THAT CAMPAIGN?

151
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,676
>> NO, THERE ARE

152
00:03:11,676 --> 00:03:12,710
INVESTIGATIVE TACTICS THAT

153
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,845
THE FBI WILL USE TO LEARN

154
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,480
MORE ABOUT WHAT AN ENEMY IS

155
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,981
DOING AS IT INFILTRATES

156
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:17,982
EITHER AN ORGANIZATION, A

157
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:18,817
POLITICAL CANDIDATE, ET

158
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:20,051
CETERA, THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

159
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:21,019
WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE.

160
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,854
IF THEY WANTED TO TILT THE

161
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:23,455
ELECTION TOWARD HILLARY

162
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:24,155
CLINTON, THEY WOULD HAVE

163
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:24,856
REVEALED THAT THIS

164
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:25,690
INVESTIGATION WAS UNDERWAY

165
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,858
WHEN IT WAS UNDERWAY.

166
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,893
THAT NEVER CAME OUT U I

167
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:29,961
THINK THAT SHOWS THAT THEY

168
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,596
MAY HAVE MADE A BAD DECISION

169
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:32,831
BY NOT TELLING THE TRUMP

170
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:35,700
CAMPAIGN ABOUT THIS --

171
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,334
>> Martha: DON'T YOU THINK

172
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:37,335
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME TYPE

173
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:38,236
OF INVESTIGATION INTO HOW

174
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:38,737
THEY HANDLED THIS?

175
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:40,071
>> THAT'S WHY I WROTE THE

176
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:41,773
BILL TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT

177
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:43,408
COMMISSION, ABSOLUTELY.

178
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:44,876
>> Martha: IN TERMS OF WHEW,

179
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:45,844
I WOULD IMAGINE, WOULD LIKE

180
00:03:45,844 --> 00:03:47,779
TO BE IN THAT ROOM DURING

181
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:48,413
THIS MEETING TOMORROW?

182
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,348
>> WELL, TOMORROW, YES.

183
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:51,483
BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE

184
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:52,651
THAT IF ANYTHING COMES OUT

185
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:55,320
OF THAT MEETING, THAT IT IS

186
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,921
ACCURATELY TOLD TO THE

187
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:56,488
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

188
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:59,791
AND WE HAVE SEEN IN CHAIRMAN

189
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,293
NUNES IN THE PAST WHETHER

190
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:02,294
UNMASKING CLAIMS OR MEMO

191
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:03,228
THAT THEY WROTE THERE HAS

192
00:04:03,228 --> 00:04:04,363
BEEN A DISTORTION, TO

193
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:05,697
PROTECT AGAINST A PERVERSION

194
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:06,899
OF THE EVIDENCE, YES,

195
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:10,569
DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE

196
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:11,270
INVOLVED.

197
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,937
>> Martha: WHY DO YOU THINK

198
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:12,571
JAMES CLAPPER IS CERTAIN

199
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:13,372
THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE ABLE

200
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:15,073
TO THROW THE ELECTION AND

201
00:04:15,073 --> 00:04:15,974
BEFORE WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY

202
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:17,509
THE DNI HE WASN'T CERTAIN?

203
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:18,709
>> I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT

204
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,411
THAT'S THE CASE.

205
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:20,546
I'M CERTAIN THAT THEY

206
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:22,414
ATTACKED US, THEY WEAPONIZED

207
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:22,848
SOCIAL MEDIA.

208
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:24,250
>> THEY TRIED TO HELP DONALD

209
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:24,550
TRUMP.

210
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,352
UNLESS WE HAD A FULL SCALE

211
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:27,353
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION,

212
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:28,520
WE COULDN'T ANSWER THAT

213
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:28,888
QUESTION.

214
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:29,855
BUT I THINK IT'S A QUESTION

215
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:31,357
THAT REPUBLICANS AND

216
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:32,091
DEMOCRATS WOULD WANT TO KNOW

217
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:33,926
THE ANSWER TO AND SHOULD

218
00:04:33,926 --> 00:04:35,127
KNOW THE ANSWER.

219
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:36,128
TO SAY.

220
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:36,695
>> Martha: ABSOLUTELY.

221
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:37,796
YOU DON'T THINK THERE WAS

222
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:38,397
ANY COLLUSION THEN.

223
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:39,465
>> I DO THINK THERE IS

224
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:40,532
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.

225
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:41,500
EVIDENCE IS NOT A

226
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:41,901
CONCLUSION.

227
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:43,535
BUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS LET

228
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:44,670
BOB MUELLER TELL US

229
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,372
CRIMINALLY WHETHER THERE WAS

230
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:46,939
COLLUSION, WHICH IS

231
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:47,673
CONSPIRACY TO THE FRAUD TO

232
00:04:47,673 --> 00:04:48,874
THE UNITED STATES.

233
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:49,475
>> Martha: I UNDERSTAND.

234
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:51,110
BUT FROM WHAT YOU ARE

235
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,077
SAYING, AS I UNDERSTAND IT,

236
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:53,646
YOU THINK THAT IT WAS A

237
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:55,114
MISTAKE FOR JAMES CLAPPER

238
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:56,582
AND JIM COMEY NOT TO HAVE

239
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:58,050
GIVEN SOME SORT OF BRIEFING

240
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,620
ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE SEEING

241
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,354
AT THE TIME TO THE CAMPAIGN?

242
00:05:02,354 --> 00:00:00,000
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY
