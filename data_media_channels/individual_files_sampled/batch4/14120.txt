Theresa Mays brags at checkers planners opened a can of worms for the Tories with the Labour Party seeing its biggest lead over the Conservatives since the last general election the last general election was a bit of a shock for everybody we kind of just assumed that really Theresa May was gonna sweep up in fact I did anyway but actually Corbin did significantly better than anyone thought and it was down to a few things now first off Theresa May ran this presidential style campaign which never really works if your candidate doesn't have that much charisma and Theresa May I feel bad saying it was true not really much charisma so the presidential style campaign failed and labor had a vague plan for Briggs and Teresa may only just scraped through after that election with her strong and stable message with a minority government government supported by the DUP and despite the unstable government that followed she managed to maintain the sort of stable position at least in the polls compared to Jeremy Corbyn and that's probably because she looked like she was at least going to follow through with the brexit result many people believe that even though she was a remainer she wanted to do it properly she wanted to get it done and a lot of people just placed their trust in her so even though she didn't get a full majority in parliament she's did reasonably well in the polls either matching labour or beating them just slightly but opinion polls now show that Jeremy Corbyn has the biggest leads over the Tories since the last general election and let's face it it's all down to checkers The Guardian reported on this and they wrote the latest opinion poll for the observer puts labour on 40 percent the same score as last month but four points ahead of the Tories who have dropped by six points since early June to 36 percent the falling Tory support would appear to be the result of conservative supporters who backed leaving the EU turning to you Kip whose support has shot up by five points from three percent last month to 8 percent May's leadership ratings have also nosedived while those of Jeremy Corbyn have remained stable May's net approval rating when the number of people who disapprove of the way she is leading the country is subtracted from the number who approved has tumbled from minus 8 percent in June to minus 24 percent over a turbulent political period of just five weeks she's now well behind Corbin who is on - 12 percent little change from - 13 percent last month so there are a couple of things we can take home from this labor is performing better than to resume but it certainly doesn't mean that Corbin is shooting up in the polls - resumes just got less popular and if there was a general election held smaller than maybe the Labor Party would get a couple more MPs than they did last time but does this really mean that Labor's heading towards a big victory I'm not sure the polls are shifting and labour is ahead of the Tories but what does this mean well I think there's a couple of things we can take home from this first off I wouldn't say that I think Jeremy Corbyn is shooting up in the polls in fact the data shows us that's not the case what the data does show is that Theresa May is just becoming less popular so Jeremy Corbyn is in the lead by default but also jeremy corbyn's the natural alternative let's not forget this kind of how our system works here when people are unhappy with one party they'll tend to shift back to the other so we're gonna see some people swing voters going from the Tories the Labour is mad but it happens if Corbin were to come out more explicitly in favor of brexit then I think he could actually do really well but the problem Corbin faces is that actually many or most of his MPs don't want breaks it to happen at all so even if he did come out in favor of brexit he's got to handle hundreds of MPs who don't agree with him so it's really difficult for them here but Corbin does have an opportunity to do well I just don't see it happening Mays week her plan is unpopular and her government is unstable so will Corbin win the next general election maybe but I doubt it'd be a landslide if a general election was held tomorrow based on these polls I suspect that the Labour Party might get a few more MPs maybe they could form a coalition with other parties maybe they could even form a minority government can you imagine how terrible that'd be but I think the big take home here is that Corbin is slightly less uninspiring than two reason may that's about it it's not like a massive shoot up for the Labour Party Corbin still struggling with anti-semitism problems there's so many scandals going on with his own party I think most people just look at him as maybe the least worst option somehow but the other take home here is that you keep is growing in the polls and some people seem to think that this is going to be a huge resurgence of you get on the political stage but the party admit themselves that they're basically a barometer party so hear me out on this Patrick O'Flynn a you keep MEP admitted this to in a tweet and in an article he published on brakes its central and when she talks about Tory voters switching over to you Kip even temporarily to save breaks it so you keep aren't going to become this huge political force again and even if they do it's only going to be temporary you keeps always being a single issue party they might produce a manifesto but we know they're always only mostly concerned about greggson all they've done is pressured the Tories into doing it so the minute the Tories sort breaks it out if the ERG the European research group managed to pull off pregs it and influence the government that way then you keep gonna die again so I don't think Labour's about to become a great force anytime soon Corbin stale people don't like him anywhere near as much as he likes to pretend they do and I don't think you keep going to become a giant political force in the UK again I think a new force needs to enter the political arena one that pressures the government and also aims to win political seats with a new agenda and a new kind of politics if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to like and subscribe you
