<font color="#E5E5E5">left until its iPhone season again and</font>

6
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,320
the first kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rumors are starting to</font>

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">come out today I saw something about the</font>

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,420
next phone having multi-touch covering

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,910
like the new apple mouse has and I'm

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,079
sure over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next few months we're</font>

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,280
going to hear a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff but to</font>

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,230
me the more interesting story at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,489
on the business side is going to be

14
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,370
distribution especially in the US what

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,410
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is a tease exclusive done</font>

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,250
here is verizon going to be a 2010 story

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,450
or is that still coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future</font>

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,809
III<font color="#E5E5E5"> think verizon is going to be selling</font>

19
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,850
the iphone by the end of 2010 and

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,649
ultimately I think everyone's pretty

21
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,360
mixed on this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why we</font>

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> son is</font>

23
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,210
it just makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense for them to do it</font>

24
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,789
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> realized there's been a lot of in</font>

25
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,650
the advertising some of the advertising

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> verizon's done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't been quite</font>

27
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">appealing to Apple but at the end of the</font>

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,750
day verizon wants to win and they're

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need the iphone the best phone</font>

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,200
the nuclear weapon if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will in the</font>

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobile phone space in order to compete</font>

32
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,340
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you will verizon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> users you</font>

33
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,110
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the phone and we think that's</font>

34
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be likely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the September</font>

35
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,619
quarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to agree with you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

36
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,710
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> AT&T did a very nice job at the</font>

37
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,600
initial launch but just not only the way

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,540
the network is performed but also

39
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,619
there's just a certain number of people

40
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:32,939
who are not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave verizon</font>

41
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,200
they're the biggest carrier it just

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,680
simply makes too much sense for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

43
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,780
discontinue the exclusive relationship

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,340
and you think the subsidy will be

45
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,049
affected at all or will Apple still get

46
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,299
the same subsidy from verizon and AT&T

47
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,790
once<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell on multiple</font>

48
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,770
carriers in the US<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple said on their</font>

49
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,570
conference called it in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi care</font>

50
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,950
environment which would be the case if

51
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">Verizon came on board that the subsidy</font>

52
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,180
would effectively stay the same or their

53
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,040
price would stay the same so I don't

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,420
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see many</font>

55
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,159
differences in the pricing they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,960
a free version take the existing hundred

57
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,090
hours and move that to free but i think

58
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really core of this if you look</font>

59
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,419
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why people in the</font>

60
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,160
united states don't buy an iphone it's

61
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,460
because it's on 18

62
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of verizon users who</font>

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,950
would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> this phone and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so Apple</font>

64
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,420
understands that I think they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

65
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything in the power to work with</font>

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,260
verizon to make this a reality great in

67
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,170
the last couple months especially google

68
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,790
android has gotten a lot of attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

69
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,400
know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> also cover google and do you</font>

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the current stable of android</font>

71
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,380
devices are any threat to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple or is it</font>

72
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,110
more along the lines of when motorola

73
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,810
and LG and Samsung and all those guys

74
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,660
are making the cheap you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> throwaway</font>

75
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,120
$50 to a hundred dollar devices or even

76
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,370
free devices on Android wear then they

77
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,780
can really flood the market not just

78
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,610
smartphones the<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-end stuff where</font>

79
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,860
Apple's playing but also the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

80
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,960
mid-range feature phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> will that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

81
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,060
threat to Apple as well there's no

82
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">question the mobile market has gotten</font>

83
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,060
more competitive in the last three

84
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,470
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the nexus ones are the best</font>

85
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,300
example of a phone that comes close to

86
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,760
the iphone but it's still not the iphone

87
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,400
the risk to Apple isn't one device

88
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,590
actually captures the imagination of the

89
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,570
public and start swinging chair it's the

90
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,610
death by a thousand cuts sure a year ago

91
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,680
was the palm pre it was the storm the

92
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,760
palm pre the the droid<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nexus one</font>

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,650
every month you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have some</font>

94
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,880
phone that's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> proclaimed to</font>

95
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,740
be an<font color="#CCCCCC"> iphone killer and that's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

96
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,750
hold off some people from actually

97
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,910
buying an iphone so we saw the same

98
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,770
phenomenon back in two thousand four to

99
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,720
two thousand six with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ipod is more</font>

100
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,180
devices started to hit the market at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

101
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,560
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day none of them can offer</font>

102
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,840
the same ubiquitous experience where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

103
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,180
can move content around through itunes

104
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,830
into your phone that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple can</font>

105
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,270
offer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a big competitive</font>

106
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,310
advantage so three billion apps

107
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,430
downloaded huge story you know I own an

108
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,290
iphone i use apps all the time do you

109
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,880
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are apps that will keep</font>

110
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,290
people on the platform is there a

111
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,390
lock-in factor<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've spent several</font>

112
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,550
hundred dollars on apps most people I

113
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,490
know have not obviously do you think

114
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,270
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep</font>

115
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,890
someone from after their<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone</font>

116
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,800
contractors ups from leaving Apple for

117
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,990
another device or carrier or these apps

118
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,670
kind of inconsequential and while it's a

119
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,410
nice story<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not really locking</font>

120
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,238
anyone into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> platform no they are</font>

121
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,040
locking things people do change their

122
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,079
apps frequently but just the ease of use

123
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they can use the apps one thing</font>

124
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,710
interesting is we go and survey people

125
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,270
and ask them what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cell phones</font>

126
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,820
that they

127
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,830
who their manufacturers only half the

128
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,210
people actually know who their

129
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,590
manufacturers a lot of times<font color="#CCCCCC"> they think</font>

130
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,690
it's their<font color="#E5E5E5"> carriers or manufacturer but</font>

131
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,220
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have iphones no it's an iphone</font>

132
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,140
and this is the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> time has ever been</font>

133
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,970
real brand loyalty in the mobile space

134
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,340
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's a combination of the</font>

135
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,780
brand loyalty which is driven by the

136
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,730
apps will keep people back and bind

137
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,390
future iPhones great and in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

138
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,250
last year's updates to the iphone the

139
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,500
3gs was kind of a minor update in terms

140
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,990
of features the pricing and the value

141
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,060
were definitely added but the features

142
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,500
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> added Apple added we're not</font>

143
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">very significant do you think this</font>

144
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,980
year's crop is going to be one where

145
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,410
they do kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of make a stronger leap or</font>

146
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,700
is this going to be another year where

147
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,590
they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's this year's iPhone</font>

148
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,930
maybe it has a little more memory maybe

149
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">a slightly better camera and it's on</font>

150
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,320
more carriers will do that and they'll

151
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,700
take the existing phone as we talked

152
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,650
about move that down but don't forget

153
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Apple's talked about a strategy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

154
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,380
having a differentiated market they're

155
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,790
trying to do that with the 3g and 3gs

156
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,710

for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> in nano foam comes out we</font>

158

159
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,990
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be surprised if in the next</font>

it really segments<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market and I know</font>

163
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,050
you don't focus on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless carrier</font>

167
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,230
their carrier partners be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

170
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
it was even simpler with only one bucket

AT&T has recently made noise that you

industry for this really to take off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

199
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,100
we think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen but</font>

200
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,930
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge i think</font>

201
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,060
is for kind of the real<font color="#E5E5E5"> sweet spot of</font>

202
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,910
the market 110 dollar monthly bill is

203
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,410
just too much for them that needs to

204
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,900
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> down great and in this quarter of</font>

205
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,600
eight point something million phones you

206
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,370
think though they'll move yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font>

207
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">point eight which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up about a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font>

208
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,500
little over a hundred percent

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">year-over-year and that's almost the 10</font>

million<font color="#E5E5E5"> they thought they would sell in</font>

211
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first year which they beat obviously</font>

212
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,540
in another year from now where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

213
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,910
more more carriers in the US song the

214
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,940
iphone where it's available<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you know</font>

215
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,100
everywhere in asia that's possible how

216
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,360
many do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could be moving a</font>

217
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,460
quarter by then but we have for next

218
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,950
year 45<font color="#E5E5E5"> million which is an average is</font>

219

to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit over 11 million per</font>

220
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,150
quarter but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of fast</font>

221
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,740
forward even beyond then that you can

222
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,780
still see continued thirty percent

223
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,120
growth so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of run the</font>

224
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,650
numbers but it's safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say is that</font>

225
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is still an early market over 1.2</font>

226
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,870
billion phones sold a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> 45 million in</font>

227
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,550
that context is not a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> phones</font>

228

great thanks gene thank you
