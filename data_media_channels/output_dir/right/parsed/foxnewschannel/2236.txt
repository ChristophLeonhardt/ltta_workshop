>> IF YOU DO PULL OUT OF THAT
DEAL DO YOU WORRY IT SENDS THE
WRONG MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA AS
YOU SEEK TO ENTER NUCLEAR TALKS
WITH KIM JONG-UN?
>> President Trump: I THINK IT
SENDS THE MIGHT MESSAGE.
IN SEVEN YEARS THE DEAL EXPIRES
AND IRAN CAN CREATE NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.
SEVEN YEARS IS TOMORROW.
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.
>> Bill: HE IS SAYING THE
DECISION ON THE IRAN NUCLEAR
DEAL WILL SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE
TO NORTH KOREA BEFORE THE
SUMMIT HAPPENS.
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING
EVIDENCE ABOUT IRAN LYING ITS
WAY THROUGH THE NEGOTIATIONS
THE DEAL WAS BASED ON AND STILL
CONCEALING THEIR NUCLEAR
ACTIVITIES.
FORMER COUNTER TERRORISM
ADVISOR AND MICHAEL WALTZ NOW
RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN FLORIDA.
WELCOME TO "AMERICA'S NEWSROOM."
IF IT'S SUCH A BAD DEAL WHY DID
OBAMA CUT IT?
>> YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO WHEN
SECRETARY OF STATE KERRY
ANNOUNCED THE DEAL AND BURIED
IN THAT ANNOUNCEMENT HE SAID
THAT THEY ASSESS THE IRANIANS
-- THEY THREW AWAY OUR
LEVERAGE, WHICH WAS A VERY
TIGHT COMPREHENSIVE SANCTIONS
REGIME THAT WAS WORKING.
AND NOW THE IRANIANS ARE TAKING
THAT CASH AND BUYING RUSSIAN
WEAPONS TO REINFORCE THEIR AIR
DEFENSES.
IF THEY DO RENEGE AND IT
DOESN'T WORK OUT AMERICAN AND
ISRAELI PILOTS IF WE EVER GO TO
A MILITARY OPTION WILL HAVE A
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT PATH TAKEN.
>> Bill: WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF
PRESIDENT TRUMP PULLS OUT?
>> I WANT TO GO TO THIS POINT
THAT A LOT OF FOLKS ARE MAKING
ABOUT THE SIGNAL THAT IT SENDS
TO THE NORTH KOREANS.
AND A LOT OF CRITICS ARE SAYING
IF WE BACK OUT OF THE DEAL
AMERICA CAN'T BE TRUSTED.
I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY THE EXACT
OPPOSITE.
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS WE'RE NOT
GOING TO SIT BACK AND LET OUR
ADVERSARIES CHEAT ON THESE
DEALS.
WE AREN'T GOING TO ENTER INTO
AN AGREEMENT IN NORTH KOREA
WHERE YOU CAN ONLY FREEZE YOUR
PROGRAM.
YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY COMPLETELY
DENUCLEARIZE LIKE LIBYA DID AND
IT HAS TO BE VERIFIABLE AND IT
WON'T ONLY BE TEMPORARY BUT
PERMANENT.
THAT'S THE MESSAGE THE
PRESIDENT IS SENDING AND WILL
WALK AWAY IF THERE ARE ANY
SHENANIGANS COMING FROM THE
NORTH KOREANS.
>> Bill: THE DOCUMENTS SHOW
IRAN HAD A SECRET NUCLEAR
WEAPONS PROGRAM FOR YEARS, HE
WRITES.
THEY HID A VAST ATOMIC ARCHIVE
FROM THE WORLD UNTIL TODAY.
