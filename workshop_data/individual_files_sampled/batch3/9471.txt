GREG GUTFELD. IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY, AND THIS IS "THE FIVE" ." WHAT DOES ROBERT MUELLER WANT TO ASK PRESIDENT TRUMP? DOZENS OF QUESTIONS ARE NOW OUT OF THE PUBLIC FOR THE WORLD TO SEE. QUESTIONS THAT WERE REPORTEDLY READ TO THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM AND THEN LINK TO THE MEDIA. THE PRESIDENT CALLED THE LEAKS DISGRACEFUL. SARAH SANDERS DIRECTED QUESTIONS FOR LEGAL TEAM EARLIER BUT HER DEPUTY RAJ SHAH HAD THIS TO SAY. I DON'T KNOW THE VERACITY OF THE ACCURACY OF THE LEAK IF THEY ARE ACCURATE, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THOSE QUESTIONS DON'T FOCUS ON THE UNDERLYING PREMISE OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WHICH WAS TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. THERE HAS BEEN OVER A YEAR OF INVESTIGATION. THERE'S BEEN DOZENS OF WITNESSES, THOUSANDS, MILLIONS PAGES OF DOCUMENTS PROVIDED. A ZERO EVIDENCE. NOT A SHRED OF EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. Kimberly: ALLY ALAN DERSHOWITZ THINKS THERE'S A STRATEGY DESIGNED TO TRIP UP PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE QUESTIONS ARE INARTFULLY DRAWN. THEY ARE WRITTEN AS OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS. THEY ARE DESIGNED TO LET HIM RAMBLE AND TALK, AND I SUSPECT THAT IS THE STRATEGY OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY BE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WEAKNESS, IF THEY WERE TO ASK HIM DIRECT, TOUGH QUESTIONS TO WHICH HE CAN ANSWER YES OR NO, THAT MIGHT NOT GIVE THEM THE ADVANTAGE THEY ARE SEEKING. Kimberly: DERSHOWITZ DISCUSSING THE STRATEGY THAT HE THINKS IS BEING EMPLOYED. ASK THE OPEN-ENDED QUESTION SO HE CAN GIVE A LONG AND LENGTHY ANSWER AND THERE MAY BE SOME DETAILS IN THERE TO TRIP HIM UP. Dana: I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THEY ARE PROFESSIONAL ENOUGH TO KNOW MAY BE THEY HAVE SOMETHING. MAYBE THEY DON'T. NONE OF US REALLY KNOW BUT I THINK YES, THE QUESTIONS WERE OPEN-ENDED. AS I UNDERSTAND IT, IT'S REALLY UNUSUAL FOR ANYONE TO BE GIVEN A LIST, ESPECIALLY 44 OR 49 QUESTIONS, HOWEVER MANY IT WAS, BEFOREHAND. I COULD SEE WHY THEY ARE OPEN-ENDED. IF YOU STARTED PROVIDING ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU WOULD WANT A "YES" OR "NO" ANSWER TO, THEN THAT WOULD LOOK A LITTLE WEIRD TOO. THIS IS A RANGE OF TOPICS THAT WE WANT TO GO OVER WITH HIM. MANY OF THESE COULD BE A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING. I HAD A LAWYER ON THE 2:00 SHOW TODAY. IT COULD END UP BEING SOMETHING WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR CLIENT DO AN INTERVIEW. I THINK THAT'S POSSIBLY THE STRATEGY BEHIND THE LEAK. I DON'T THINK THIS LEAK CAME FROM THE MUELLER TEAM. I THINK IT CAME FROM SOMEBODY EITHER ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEGAL TEAM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT CAN I GET IT OUT THERE. LET EVERYBODY START TALKING ABOUT IT AND THEN EITHER, FOR THE LAWYERS TO BE ABLE TO SAVE MR. PRESIDENT, EVERYBODY THINKS YOU SHOULDN'T DO AN INTERVIEW WITH MUELLER. TRY TO GET HIM TO AGREE. Kimberly: ALL RIGHT, GREG, HOW DO YOU SEE IT? Greg: I THINK THE LEAK CAME FROM "FOX & FRIENDS." TREASURE TROVE. WE KEEP HEARING THE PHRASE TREASURE TROVE. THIS IS A TREASURE TROVE. MAY BE. BUT IT MIGHT BE A TREASURE TROVE FOR REPUBLICANS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE COUNTING ON WINNING THE HOUSE, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS RUSSIAN STUFF IS GOING TO HELP YOU. I THINK OVER TIME THIS IS BECOMING A SQUALID DISCRETION DISTRACTION. I THINK TRUMP SHOULD SAY WE WILL ANSWER THESE THINGS IN WRITING AND THEN BEAT PEOPLE OVER THE HEAD WITH IT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD, WHAT IS MISSING? WHAT ARE WE NOT SAY NOW THAT WE USED TO SEE DOING "THE FIVE"? ISIS VIDEOS. ALMOST EVERY WEEK WE SAW AN ISIS VIDEO. FOR MONTHS, WE TALKED ABOUT THE NUCLEAR THREAT OF NORTH KOREA. THESE ARE TWO EXISTENTIAL THREATS MISSING FROM THE NEWSFEED. I DO THINK THE MEDIA IS COMPLETELY UNPREPARED TO REPORT TRUMP'S SUCCESSES. THEY DON'T HAVE IT IN THEIR TOOLBOX. YOU HAVE TWO MAJOR THINGS MISSING AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO REPORT, SO YOU FOCUS ON PORNOGRAPHY AND YOUR FOCUS ON COLLUSION. COLLUSION WHICH IS FALLING APART AND HAS BEEN FALLING APART. NOW IT'S GOING TO BECOME ABOUT OBSTRUCTION. THEY DON'T HAVE IT IN THEIR TOOLKIT SO THEY ARE LEFT DOING THIS. WHAT'S THE END RESULT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT. IF YOU IMPEACH A PRESIDENT IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME REALLY HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENTS, HISTORY WILL NOT BE KIND TO YOU. THE VOTERS WILL NOT BE KIND TO YOU. NO ONE WILL BE KIND TO YOU. Kimberly: INTERESTING. YOU ARE SAYING THE MEDIA HAS GOT A VERY EMPTY BOX. SNAP-ON TOOLS. SNAP OFF MEDIA.
