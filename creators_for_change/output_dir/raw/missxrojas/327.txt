21
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,309
much about grieving and grief and

experience and all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and a lot of</font>

23
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,190
it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very short term because a</font>

lot of it is like two months after or a

27
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,120
actually threw pretty little liars in

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,550
part where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just remember so much</font>

29
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,559
about their friendship with<font color="#E5E5E5"> alison and</font>

30
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,750
specific things she said and rather blah

31
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">i know that these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are stories</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i know</font>

32
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,049
that these are fictions invented to

33
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,820
comfort us and in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to come for us</font>

34
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,500
that we will remember everything about

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,630
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people perfectly and that we can</font>

36
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue to find out about them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

37
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,320
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass but i think that there is a</font>

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,390
certain limit on that and that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

39
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,080
something false about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that we pass</font>

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,119
on because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that little bit of</font>

41
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,130
hope and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that you know some</font>

42
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,890
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out so much after</font>

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,439
the person's past but some people don't

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,110
and rather than becoming a process of

45
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,079
remembering it becomes the process of

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,820
forgetting without even without even

47
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,200
realizing it i'm always conflicted

48
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,909
between wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you everything</font>

49
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">about my dad and tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you stories and</font>

50
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,600
tell you things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that annoyed me and</font>

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,799
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were great and blah blah</font>

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,710
blah and telling you nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about him</font>

53
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,100
whatsoever to kind of keep that mine in

54
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,960
a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> torn between those two</font>

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,299
things all the time that it didn't occur

56
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,520
to me that things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font>

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,490
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to diminish that I was going</font>

58
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to forget them and yeah it's just it</font>

59
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:05,280
makes

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,100
really sad to to feel myself growing up

61
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,899
and growing away from it and to feel

62
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,360
like it's oh I don't know it like it sir

63
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,150
like it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> aged</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we in a way I feel</font>

64
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,700
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not older than people around me some</font>

65
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,400
people who are older than me because

66
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,810
they haven't been faced<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain</font>

67
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,160
part of their life where they have to

68
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,930
deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it so I think that had been</font>

69
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,450
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of building up or week or last week</font>

70
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that just led to point where I was</font>

71
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,319
like okay I'm done the end I need to

72
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,530
just sit in bed and watch shows made in

73
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,840
other countries and read books it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

74
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,140
it's just such a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> road it's just</font>

75
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,130
it's the longest longest road for all um

76
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,390
driving John say to me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

77
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,250
it's gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long road and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

78
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought you can't you can't imagine that</font>

79
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,540
you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine the scale of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

80
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,590
though you're trying to tell yourself

81
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,000
now you're gonna have to deal with it

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,010
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a process there's going</font>

83
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,069
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> several stages you always at some</font>

84
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,480
point you have think Vidya then it's

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,620
gonna be done and then you're just going

86
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,970
to move on I read a really really great

87
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,350
interview with Stephen Colbert last

88
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,580
night yeah actually able to play<font color="#CCCCCC"> board</font>

89
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,370
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a kind of unusual experience</font>

90
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,410
of reading an interview and having all

91
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,239
his naked women on the other side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

92
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,070
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> side of the page for this you</font>

93
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,019
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a satirist a lot</font>

94
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,030
of satire and he has his own television

95
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,040
program but when he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old he</font>

96
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,600
lost his father and two of his brothers

97
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,329
in a plane a plane crash i think it was

98
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,709
i he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the phrase</font>

99
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,579
of grief visiting you and grief having

100
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,769
its own presence at its own time Martin

101
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:34,230
you just have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept that and accept</font>

102
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,480
it as almost a separate entity but

103
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,190
that's also part of you it was a big

104
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,560
like light bulb interview reading

105
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,989
session I love those moments I love when

106
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,239
you you read something and it just makes

107
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,100
you understand so much about yourself

108
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,870
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had that experience all the time</font>

109
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,200
even in tiny ways and that's what I love

110
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">about reading and it makes me realize</font>

111
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,480
things about other people and just about

112
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,160
humanity as a whole and the world as a

113
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,900
whole and I just it makes me<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy</font>

114
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,079
that's why i read in many ways it's just

115
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,049
hard to not remember things<font color="#CCCCCC"> about him</font>

116
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,370
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm trying really really hard I</font>

117
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,069
really want to tell stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> about him</font>

118
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:16,480
but I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the mid-tier</font>

119
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,540
you know certainly at a difficult stage

120
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,270
so and you can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by like how I</font>

121
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,240
fell out<font color="#CCCCCC"> refrain just that so that's</font>

122
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,420
today it's a happy smiley video mm-hmm

123
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,950
for those of you who have lost someone

124
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,250
what was easy read that helped and what

125
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,610
the things you read the hurt and what do

126
00:04:36,610 --> 00:00:00,000
you think grief is<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> liters</font>
