the elections in Mexico on July 2nd led to the new president he actually comes from a completely new political party and his name is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador now we have seen the rejection of establishment politics in numerous countries throughout the world including here in the United States and obrador is yet another representation of anti-establishment politics leftist obrador was elected president of Mexico on Sunday in a landslide victory that upended the nation's political establishment he won by capturing more than half of the vote and that's according to early returns more than any candidate since the nation began its transition to democracy nearly 20 years ago so just to quickly go through what he campaigned on and what his platform was he focused on ending corruption which is incredibly important in Mexico corruption you know between law enforcement politicians and drug cartels runs rampant and also he wanted to focus on reducing the crime that stems from this corruption he also wants to address Mexico's endemic poverty and that's really what stood out to the masses in Mexico he really spoke to them in terms of you know economic situations but some are arguing that he has not really given a detailed outline of how he's going to accomplish the very things that he campaigned on how is he going to tackle poverty what is he gonna do about these drug cartels and the corruption and keep in mind that leading up to the elections on July 2nd at minimum 136 political candidates were slaughtered because of gang violence these are individuals who said that they would fight corruption for the most part and gangs specifically target them targeted them and it was a form of of course murder and intimidation so anyone who did want to speak out against corruption wouldn't have the ability to do so ok so two important things about Obrador and then I want to get to our media's coverage of and how conservative our media is so first of all on over door winning it is fantastic news so this is funny give in our current political context in America throughout the campaign they kept calling him a dangerous socialist that he would try to help the poor in the middle class and then it turns out the Mexican people really love that idea kind of reminds me of two people in politics that got beetrice maybe Alexandria Carson Cortez oh you're gonna help regular people people like oh really I mean she was described as dangerous by Sean Hannity so it's those parallels there in that regard and of course Bernie Sanders so keep it up establishment all you do is help us now if you're wondering hey he got over half the vote while I was why is that a landslide there are a lot of different parties in Mexico as opposed to the US where there's only two dominant political parties so it by the standards of Mexico and how split that vote is this was a crushing victory normally I the other side conceding defeat takes a long long time they called within 45 minutes which is also a record in Mexico yeah yeah we lost you crush this I got it so now second part of this is told so now I didn't call this election I don't I don't want anybody get that wrong idea okay which you might from me saying told you but I've been saying and anybody who watches the show it can tell you populism is gonna win it's it's not that hard to figure out people are sick of basically what is corporate rule over all of us in Europe in America and Latin America all over the world we're sick of it and they kept telling us that it was going to trickle down that if we gave everything to the rich and the powerful the tax cuts the deregulation everything else that it would eventually get to us but it didn't get to us so people are going populist whether they're going left or they're going right and so that's why and I said Corbin would do great and would when he didn't win but he closed a 20-point lead it was actually twenty four point lead and he closed 20 points of it Bernie Sanders didn't win but remember they had enormous institutional disadvantages including almost all the media being against them Bernie Sanders closed a sixty point lead against Hillary Clinton and then you obviously trouble was he was a fake populist but he ran on populism and he did win in a shocking victory brexit was populism and then there's populism all Italy Greece some go and left some going right Colombia another example that's right and in this case here is a populist with a massive victory just as we said and one last thing I said if you go populist left it will be far more popular than populist right because populist right has to pull off this hard trick don't worry I'm gonna give everything to the rich and powerful but somehow that's gonna help you right okay whereas the left says no I'm just going to help you hey which is much more direct much more logical and much more understandable that's why a populist left candidate would win much easier so very quickly what I'm noticing with the populist right you're I think for the most part you're right but the strategy from the populist right isn't we're gonna help you by by giving the rich and powerful even more although those arguments are usually made when it comes to things like tax cuts what I'm saying is from the populist right we're gonna help you as a disadvantaged person by attacking those who are even more powerless that are taking all those limited resources away from you right and so they Stoke up the the fear the anger the hatred and that does work but you're right Jake it's not as popular as what you see from leftist candidates who also preach you know populism too you know uplift people and help people in general and if you remember the number one winning strategy for Trump was drained the swamp I'm against the corruption and I'm against the global financial elite now he named them as Goldman Sachs and then he filled a huge percentage of his cabinet with Goldman Sachs employees because on the right it's all a trick they're not at all populist okay so weighted lie to you and deceive you they say oh no we figured out who the powerful are in America it's the guy who crossed the border from Mexico without a dollar in his pocket he's the powerful guy he's the one manipulating things Muslims are in charge in America they're about to do Sharia law now that is preposterous so if you have a populist left candidate people go yes now you say that's a theory it's not a theory anymore look all across the world and including right here in Mexico with this election so I'm almost going to stop saying it because I'm afraid that the establishment is gonna catch on and fight against people like Bernie Sanders even harder right now they're asleep at the wheel like actually giving people what they actually wanted a democracy that's crazy dog well I mean the establishment at least here in the United States is waking up but luckily they're not attacking you know Bernie Sanders type candidates the way that they did before if they're going to they will but I think well we're let's let's also give credit where credit is due we are seeing some politicians here in the u.s. say you know what maybe I don't want to take the corporate PAC money you know maybe I also want to fight for the same issues that Bernie Sanders was fighting for so I want to give those politicians some credit because look when you have establishment Democrats for instance attacking Alexandria Ocasio Cortes or Bernie Sanders or democratic socialism in general oh we're gonna come after them there's no question about it but when people are willing to adapt and evolve I think it's important to you know give them the carrot and if they don't follow through you give them the stick yeah and so they will trust me they will attack Bernie Sanders viciously when the if he's involved in a presidential race now let me go to the our media cuz it affects the story about Mexico it also affects how they cover things here in America I'll take the New York Times is an example they wrote the story and so unlike the right-wing we don't think their media is lying they didn't make up the results of the election there you know they didn't manufacture news it's not fake news but they do have a slant you know so throughout the article describing over doors win they say things like here's a slate of social programs and but he doesn't explain how he's gonna avoid overspending and harming the economy look at the assumption in that sentence well if you have someone who's actually trying to help the people they're going to overspend but we just had Donald Trump for example in America overspend he gave way too much at the defense contractors and then giant tax cuts and there's now two trillion dollar hole in deficit but never-ever frame it that way when is anyone on the left they're gonna try to help people overspending how are you to not harm the economy actually giving all the money to the rich in the form of tax cuts hasn't helped at all and but in reality if you give it to the poor in the middle class they have to spend it right away that money circulates in the economy and does help the economy but if you work for the New York Times you must write in print well if it's a leftist overspend I mean really can he not overspend it's gonna hard it might harm the economy look at the framing but I just getting warmed up they said he's a firebrand with a tendency to dismiss critics in the media and elsewhere and how will he govern when the right wing gets in office they never asked how will you govern right can you make sure to be able to govern when the left would again but these impractical leftist do they really know how to govern and this is called the liberal media I'm not anywhere near done in the end these are quotes from the New York Times in the end the nation's desire for change outweigh any of the misgivings the candidate inspired what misgivings he wanted a landslide what misgivings it's not like it was a close election no you have the misgivings and you don't even realize it they didn't this is not a conspiracy the New York Times didn't get in a room and decide they hate liberals it is ingrained in their bubble in their heads and their groupthink no and they must have misgivings because all the people that in this room hey they don't know it but we have great disdain for anyone on the Left we all have misgivings the Mexican people obviously didn't but uh I don't know I don't know how he's gonna overcome my misgivings so why don't you be honest about it okay what can I can I just respond to that really quickly so you're right they do specifically attack what over door wants to accomplish when it comes to the impoverished or those who are disadvantaged economically but I feel like of all the promises that he made during his campaign the most challenging to accomplish is you know doing away with corruption that is a difficult thing to do in a country like Mexico where local law enforcement is is very much in bed with drug cartels so look if you're criticizing that portion of his platform that deserves a little bit of aspect not speculation assessment scrutiny yes exactly and and they totally ignore that even though I again I would argue that is the most challenging thing to accomplish I think that's telling III know but isn't it wonderful to have someone who is actually going to try to end corruption yes I mean I love that that's what he wants to do I'm just saying if you're gonna do a deep dive in his policies or or what he's saying he's gonna do out of all the things he's promised the thing that seems the most challenging is the corruption yeah but look so unfortunately it's gotten to a point and I really think the New York Times and other media does wonderful reporting most of the time but it's getting hard to trust their reporting on some of these issues because they say later that he on the issue of violence ending violence largely failed to articulate a policy that goes much beyond platitudes but that's the same thing they said about Bernie Sanders even though he had long descriptions of his policies on his website he would speak for an hour and a half all about policy and how he would get things done and the reporters would come and go I wish he'd explain how things would get done he was dead for like an hour and a half right so when they say that he has platitudes I'm sorry but I don't trust you III don't believe that that's the case so if they improve their reporting which I sincerely want them to do because I like the right wing we don't want to destroy the media we want to make the media better right then I then I would have more faith in their reporting about Obrador right now it does seem deeply biased so and we are very upfront about our perspective the fact that he's actually gonna try to serve the Mexican people and try to end the corruption I love it and I hope to god he can do it that doesn't mean that you shouldn't hold him accountable if he does it of course you should two easy ways to follow Young Turks
