the economy is going into a spiral at dysfunctionality Venezuela has of today the highest inflation in the world Venezuelans today cannot eat you see people eating from the garbage hospitals that have massive deaths of newborns and you know there is no access to medication a cycle of violence and street protests Chavez was seen very much so as you know a man of the people the poorer people and he identified with them and he loved them and they loved him he was a very popular it was very imaginative but Chavez had a base of oil he had a cash cow that never never a leader in Venezuela had before when Chavez first came to power oil was at roughly seven to nine dollars a barrel but by 2004 2005 were looking at oil price per barrel lifting at over $100 a barrel he has power and he has money and so he decides no forms of social policies that can distribute the oil revenues in a in a more massive way downwards towards those that more needed to in the poor the construido mcaro so he went to Cuba and Cuba came up with a bunch of new social programs massive new social programs a for health care for access to food and for scholarships we have a whole raft of these so-called miss yonas the social programs which give people citizenship rights identity cards access to job training access to breakfast clubs university systems so this is a very comprehensive effort to deliver basic social services what this is doing though is essentially still using oil as that redemptive quality to bring social change while bringing social change deepening the dependence on oil and he can do this while the prices of oil are high the whole strategy of Chavez Moe initially was about diversification of the economy reducing Venezuela's vulnerability to oil price bust and in the initial chavvy stir model this was hinged very much around processes of land reform trying to reduce Venezuela's dependence on agricultural imports and food imports what happens after the presidential elections of 2006 is that Chavez is bringing oil straight back into the center of Venezuela's economic model he had a high price of oil and he had access to finance he could borrow as if it was going out of fashion so he decided that that was the moment to radicalize the process the Venezuelan government begins to embark on a very ad-hoc a very clumsy process of nationalization nationalizing really big heavy state assets so we're talking about the electricity sector the oil sector the telecommunications sector he also went out and bought the Banco de Venezuela from the Spanish bank Santander we went out and bought all the cement problems the country lost most of his private business people were prosecuted their assets were taken by the state Chavez thought that did that didn't matter because he have resources to import we are according to two medicines we are putting clothes we're importing cars we are putting everything and we destroy the production capacity of the country it really doesn't have an economic model more than bring back everything to the state control he's trying to understand what socialism looks like in Venezuela and that's a big challenge again no one has done that yet so in one level does it mean creating parallel institutions you have a basically a parallel state structure instead of reforming ministries and institutions simply creating parallel structures such as the Monsieur honours themselves so you've got high levels of expenditure on bureaucracy on duplication of responsibility all of this is becoming very onerous and expensive the only way that this model can be sustained for Venezuela is through foreign borrowing they used the period of the oil boom from 2004 to 2014 to six tuple the public debt his oil prices went up Venezuela spent it all they didn't set any money aside and a sovereign wealth fund and a rainy day foot you know so they've got money in case things go down everybody in the oil industry knows oil prices are cyclical Chavez gets sick he gets cancer meanwhile many things began to unravel Capital Markets said these guys are borrowing as if it was going out of fashion so they sort of started to stop lending to the country the economy starts to go down people begin to say wait a minute before it's all gone I'm gonna get my piece of it now when Chavez at first comes to power he had said that essentially there was going to be a you know a hard hand and iron fist against these problems of corruption but the reality was that absolutely nothing was done so the end result is kind of decay of the chavista Bolivarian revolution and a state which is becoming more and more indebted biggest sucker in Venezuelan history it's the guy who's gonna follow Chavez as president and that's exactly what Maduro is inherited a legacy of oil dependence at a period when Venezuela has gone bust and at a time when the old price has gone bust in 2014 the economy was doing poorly but as of June 2014 the price of oil started to go down when the dollars the oil price start dropping the government wasn't she had a severe deft and did not have enough dollars to buy the food imports and the medicine imports and all the good imports that he was buying before and so from one day to the other their disgust 'ti overwhelmed the country they are the basic food milk rice soap toothpaste these things disappear Venezuela's total stock of foreign debt is about 150 billion dollars it's seeking to try and renegotiate with and bondholders but the problem is is that these sanctions that the US has imposed make it very difficult for Venezuela to roll over its debt the collapse of economic activity that started in 2014 worsened in 2015 and then went down the drain in 2016 and 2017 makes this period from 2013 onwards the largest recession in in the Western Hemisphere history almost twice as large as the Great Depression of the US Medora has simply not addressed any of the problems or the legacy that he inherited from President Chavez that's been a lot very difficult for people who are not in that elite like loyalist circle around Maduro profiting and benefitting and living the highlife because they don't have to worry about going shopping everyday or paying their bills you know the people actually in the street who are experiencing the dramatic and detrimental effects of the economic crisis are the ones who are saying wait a minute something's not right here you know and in the end you know Maduro can wipe his hands clean of as much as he wants but he is the president so he becomes the one who is responsible you
