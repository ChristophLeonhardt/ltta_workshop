1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,120
If you’ve traveled to Hong Kong chances
are you’ve stayed or worked here

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,190
amongst the skyscrapers of Hong Kong island

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,410
But Hong Kong Island running out of room to
expand.

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,130
Housing is the least affordable anywhere in
the world.

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,740
And you don’t get much for your money.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,880
The average sized flat is smaller than what
you’d get in Manhattan.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,480
And many Hong Kongers live in apartments not
much bigger than a garage.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,629
It’s because of this pressure that the next
time you visit your more likely to stay here

9
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:39,880
Across Victoria Harbour in Tsim Sha Tsui.

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:55,960
Tsim Sha Tsui is not easy to say and it's often
mispronounced, so it's known to expats as TST

11
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:00,359
Today the area is a growing metropolis packed
with a huge variety of restaurants,

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,400
modern hotels and sleek museums.

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,440
So it’s hard to believe that it once looked
like this

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,700
During the 1880s it was a watch post for the
British colony and some of the grand old buildings

15
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,300
still remain.

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,360
This is The 1881 Heritage building used to
be the headquarters of the Marine Police

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,180
Now it’s filled with high end shopping,
a hotel, restaurants and bars

18
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,780
But most people come here  to take photos

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,469
Walk down the road a couple blocks and you’ll
come to Hong Kong’s iconic Peninsula Hotel

20
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:41,070
Built in 1928 it has made appearances in films
like James Bond and The Dark Knight

21
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,090
It’s known for its fleet of Rolls-Royce
Phantoms painted in the hotel’s signature

22
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,090
green.

23
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,420
For which it holds the record for the largest
ever single order.

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,980
Running through the center of TST is Nathan
Road. What started as a muddy, country path

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,120
built by the British in 1861, is now a
shopper paradise.

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,060
Nathan Road is probably best known for its
tailors and the tradition of tempting, or

27
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,110
twisting the arms of tourists walking by.

28
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:25,380
Hand made suits start at around $300 but for
higher quality threads go to Empire International Taylors

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,280
This unassuming store in in fact the base
of a global operation.

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,870
This family run business sells suits around
the world - mostly thanks to word of mouth.

31
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,019
Now you’re dressed for dinner head to the
top of the One Peking Road tower, this gem

32
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:49,360
of a Chinese restaurant is made to look like
a Hutong, or old Chinese alley

33
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,920
Go up two floors and you’ll find Aqua Spirit,
one of Hong Kong’s premier bars.

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,290
It has some of the best views of the city

35
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,080
And when you get tired of the hustle and bustle
of Tsim Sha Tsui, walk over to one of Hong Kong's

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,800
most famous institutions - the Star
Ferry

37
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,739
Running since 1888, this is the oldest mode
of transportation across the harbour.

38
00:03:14,740 --> 00:00:00,000
And you can hop on for just 30 cents and enjoy
one of the world’s most photographed harbours.
