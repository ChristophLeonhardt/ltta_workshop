the biggest there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> over four thousand</font>

dollars for every man woman and child

and about eighty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of its and</font>

hundreds they're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3400 for every</font>

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,480
just counting money outside banks if you

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,850
look at the facts the use of cash in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,010
legal economy is declining in fact a lot

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,920
of young people barely use it but the

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">demand for cash is soaring especially</font>

12
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,050
these hundred dollar bills same all

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,030
around the world what gives and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

14
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,980
the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of it's used in the</font>

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,530
global underground economy for tax

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,290
evasion and crime<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am not in favor of</font>

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,870
abolishing cash let's be really clear I

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's really important to have it</font>

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,350
it's really crude but part of the

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,199
argument is that it's much heavier to

21
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,510
smuggle large amounts of money intense

22
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,920
than hundreds so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,199
complaint sometimes from central<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank's</font>

24
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,670
saying you know we make a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font>

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,289
printing money it costs almost nothing

26
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,570
to print a hundred-dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill to print</font>

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,229
a 500 euro note yes you're making money

28
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:08,790
printing this stuff but it facilitates

29
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,790
tax evasion which is way more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

30
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,470
government gains from the currency

31
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,869
obviously if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce crime five</font>

32
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,330
percent with such a simple thing it

33
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,680
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good idea what's going to</font>

happen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> someday cash gets used less</font>

35
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,909
and less in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the legal economy it's</font>

36
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,430
already the case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

37
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,530
to continue and I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you know</font>

38
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,790
there could be other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw the</font>

39
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,490
terror<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks in France catalyzed</font>

40
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,770
getting rid of the 500<font color="#CCCCCC"> euro note because</font>

41
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,619
apparently the terrorists used it we're

42
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,850
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get rid of cash all</font>

43
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,470
together we need a physical currency

44
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,720
will always will even a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred years</font>

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,450
from now at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a for occasional</font>

can't lightly surrender having the
