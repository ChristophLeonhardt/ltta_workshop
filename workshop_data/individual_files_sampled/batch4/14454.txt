Ottawa mayor Jim Watson wants provincial and federal help to deal with the migrant crisis in his city now the best help Jim Watson can get is for Toronto's Mayor John Tory to quit pretending to be the municipal version of Justin Trudeau Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson is appealing to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau into new Ontario premier Doug Ford for money and resources to deal with the migrant crisis that is now poised to suffocate the homeless shelter system in his City and the stats coming out of Ottawa about the damage the migrant crisis is doing to the social safety net there are startling the number of chronically homeless families in Ottawa so those people who have been homeless for at least 6 months in the last one calendar year went from just 87 families in 2016 to 236 and 2017 and because of the lack of capacity to deal with that exponential increase the city has been placing families in motel or hotel rooms that number has jumped from 92 families using that service at one point or another in 2016 to 182 in 2017 which prompted mayor Jim Watson to write a letter to the new Ontario premier Doug Ford and a similar letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying that Ottawa continues to experience a high demand for emergency shelters and that's exacerbated by pressures of a regular migration you know even when these politicians are trying to tell you the truth they just have to be politically correct and use words like your regular migration instead of fully GLE want to went on to say that the ability to respond to the current increased demand for shelter placement is hampered by the lack of capacity this is affecting not only asylum seekers but also those families who have been destabilized locally households moving to Ottawa from other cities and provinces and other newcomers entering Canada through Euler immigration channels okay let's set aside the political mumbo-jumbo there for a second there's a lot of truth in this Trudeau inspired a swath of illegal immigration with his welcome to Canada tweet that is now hurting regular old Canadians but it's also hurting the good folks who want to become Canadian the old-fashioned legal way illegal immigration is hurting legal immigrants meanwhile Ontario Premier Doug Ford has the right idea since sucking up to Trudeau is exactly what landed Ontario's major municipalities in this migrant mess in the first place and I'll get to that in a second Doug Ford is now withdrawing Kathleen Wynne's cooperation with Ottawa over asylum-seekers by cooperation Doug Ford means the federal government just allows migrants to waltz into the country unvetted and unmonitored and then dumps them into Canada's urban municipalities leaving the local governments to pick up the pieces that's what cooperation with Ottawa means in this instance Doug Ford is done playing ball with the feds he's tired of dealing with the consequences of Justin Trudeau's need to be the global leader of the anti Trump cabal he's tired of dealing with the problems on his doorstep remember just introduced welcome to Canada tweet that spurred all this illegal immigration to Manitoba Ontario and Quebec Trudeau couldn't have done any of the things he's doing now to Ontario just dumping migrants on mass into the province without the help and support of the mayor of Ontario's largest city at the time Toronto's Mayor John Tory was fully on board with Justin Trudeau's welcome to Canada initiative even reaffirming Toronto status as one of those so-called Asylum cities look at this tweet from just back in April as Toronto's homeless shelters were busting at the seams with migrants it's from Mayor John Tory saying that April as refugee rights Awareness Month in Canada and that he had the chance to speak on the subject at the Ontario Council of agencies serving immigrants awareness event my favorite line here we must continue to embrace an approach to refugees which has worked well for our country and our city who worked well what's worked well for Tory here a 100% increase in shelter usage and Canadians being turned away from them Ontario University students being kicked out of her own dorm rooms because their student housing is now being used as urban refugee camps by the way can we just do min on that sign John Torrio is speaking in front of there the one that says refugees welcome if you look down there it says open borders you see these people like John Tory don't want any sort of immigration enforcement at all they just want a constant stream of future voters flooding across the border and a constant stream of money from people like me dedicated depending for it all open borders that's what it means we can either have open borders as the signed John Tory is standing in front of suggests or we can have homeless shelters for Canadians but we can't have both as Ontario is learning the hard way Jim Watson should be appealing to his colleague Toronto Mayor John Tory asking Tory to shut his mouth and quit his moral preening as Tory tries to be the municipal version of Justin Trudeau the problems of Toronto are now spilling into Ottawa and elsewhere in the province of Ontario into places where people cannot vote against John Tory's stupid sanctuary ideas and it is high time for the other mayors to stand up and speak out for the rebel dot media I'm Sheila Gunn read what you just
