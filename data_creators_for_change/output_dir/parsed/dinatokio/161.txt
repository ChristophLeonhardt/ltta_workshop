foot man morning guys the light is
really not grating my car anyway today
I'm vlogging because me Sid and Hannah
are going out I know doesn't happen
often right I thought we'd go for a nice
day out somewhere do a bit of
exploration in London obviously because
we recently moved and we finally just
about settled so I've been wanting to go
to a maze for ages Hampton Court Palace
and basically that's repel others
through a list yeah but that Palace also
has a maze in the ground and also has
like a really cool playground you like

both holla look both I'm gonna go to
West fields afterwards because Sydney's
to get his mom a bday present
wagwan fell it's one hour drive to get
there how many miles is it it's only
like 16 miles but it's taking us an hour
because we're in London it's only 16 16
miles is quite a while uh no it's not

minutes or half an hour normally 16
miles will on the motorway will take 16
minutes
20 minutes yeah maybe if you drive a lap
loonatics I'm just passing the time

currently on level oh my god I thought I
was on 20 Emily on 19 I'm on level 19

afternoon and I can't frigging pass
level 19 I've got to defeat eight slugs
win thirty yellow daisy flower things
and pick up two diamonds

very addictive which can be a slight
problem if the guys in for best fiends
