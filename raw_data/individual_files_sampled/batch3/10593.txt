much of the city of Aleppo still lies in ruins reviving it to its former glory is a task of gargantuan proportions and of immense political and economic importance the citadel of aleppo has become the symbol of the city's resistance but Aleppo is much more than just a maze of antique streets and attractions from history books the militants have stolen computer units with chips for the machines they destroyed the factory on purpose they wanted to damage Syrian industry as a whole and specifically industry but now that the form industrial hub is slowly getting back on track things are finally looking up for the people of Aleppo two years ago during the war we couldn't even open our shops the shelling snipers were everywhere you couldn't live under such circumstances we covered the roof of the building back then so that we could take cover it was unbearable we took shelter for about half an hour whenever the shelling started we just locked ourselves in here thank God now we can work peacefully day and night we just hang around smoking just like the good old days the atmosphere is really good around here the weather is nice everybody's feeling safe and it's only getting better you can see getting better day by day I was lucky enough not to leave my home behind this is the district the rebels couldn't get to at the time there was a blockade once but it was firmly lifted now thank God things are better despite all the things we've been through we are now better well you know it's safe you can return home if you have slides and ruins you can still fix it the main thing is it's safe now historically the city of Aleppo has been an economic capital of Syria and now with the war gone finally some traders are coming back to its streets oh my gosh darn of reporting from Aleppo in Syria our tea you
