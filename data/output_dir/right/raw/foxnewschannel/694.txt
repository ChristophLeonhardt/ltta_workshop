1
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:11,975
>> Tucker: IT HAS BEEN MANY

2
00:00:11,976 --> 00:00:13,743
MONTHS SINCE THE MASS SHOOTING

3
00:00:13,744 --> 00:00:14,677
IN LAS VEGAS, THE LARGEST IN

4
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:18,314
MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY.

5
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:23,353
EVEN NOW KEY INFORMATION

6
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:25,922
CONTINUES TO TRICKLE OUT.

7
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:27,957
EVEN AS STEPHEN PADDOCK

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,928
THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS, WHY IS

9
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,963
THIS FOOTAGE COMING OUT NOW AND

10
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:36,733
WHY DID THE POLICE NOT ACT FOR

11
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:37,533
SEVERAL MINUTES?

12
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:38,768
CATHERINE BARDO IS AN ATTORNEY

13
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:40,637
REPRESENTING SOME OF THE VICTIMS

14
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:43,473
OF THOSE SHOOTINGS AND SHE JOINS

15
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:44,540
US.

16
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,876
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

17
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:48,177
THE FIRST QUESTION IS, WHY ARE

18
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:49,345
WE FINDING THIS OUT NOW?

19
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:51,281
IT SEEMS LIKE A CENTRAL PIECE OF

20
00:00:51,282 --> 00:00:54,951
INFORMATION IN THE STORY.

21
00:00:54,952 --> 00:00:57,153
>> BECAUSE THE COURTS ORDERED

22
00:00:57,154 --> 00:00:58,554
THE LAS VEGAS METRO POLICE

23
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:01,758
DEPARTMENT TO RELEASE ALL OF

24
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,492
THIS VIDEO FOOTAGE AND PURSUANT

25
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:06,562
TO COURT ORDER, THEY ARE

26
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:09,198
RELEASING IT PIECE BY PIECE OVER

27
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:10,600
THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS.

28
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:12,368
AS YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY WE

29
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:13,636
RECEIVED ABOUT A DOZEN VIDEOS

30
00:01:13,637 --> 00:01:19,509
AND MANY MORE AUDIO VIDEOS

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,211
SHOWING MOSTLY POLICE OFFICER

32
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:22,845
BODY WORN CAMERA FOOTAGE.

33
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:27,216
IT'S FASCINATING AND IT IS ALSO

34
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:28,918
VERY, VERY UPSETTING.

35
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:29,919
IT SHOWS THE EXTREMIS OF THE

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,823
EVENT AND OF THE TRAUMA THAT

37
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:36,693
EVERYONE THERE, THE 22,000

38
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:38,161
PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE HAVE

39
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:38,928
SUFFERED.

40
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,897
I HAVE BEEN IN THAT VERY HALLWAY

41
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:46,803
32ND FLOOR.

42
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:55,545
AND WHAT THE VIDEO CLEARLY SHOWS

43
00:01:55,546 --> 00:01:56,946
IS ONE PARTICULAR POLICE OFFICER

44
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:59,349
WAS ON THE 31ST FLOOR.

45
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,786
NOT THE 32ND FLOOR, AND HE WAS

46
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:05,521
THERE FOR MANY MOMENTS.

47
00:02:05,522 --> 00:02:07,623
WHAT WE FIND INTERESTING IS THAT

48
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:08,524
THE MANDALAY BAY SECURITY

49
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:09,759
OFFICER WHO WAS WITH THAT

50
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,525
PARTICULAR POLICE OFFICER BEFORE

51
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:14,263
THE SHOOTING STARTED AND RACED

52
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:15,365
THROUGH THE CASINO FLOOR AND

53
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:17,834
RACED UP THE ELEVATORS WITH HIM,

54
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:19,202
THIS PARTICULAR MANDALAY BAY

55
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:20,336
SECURITY GUARD SAID THAT HE WAS

56
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:24,607
ON THE 30 SECOND-FLOOR WITH THAT

57
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:27,243
PARTICULAR OFFICER IN THE VIDEO

58
00:02:27,244 --> 00:02:30,179
ON THE 31ST FLOOR.

59
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:30,913
THIS MANDALAY BAY SECURITY

60
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:34,751
MANAGER TOLD THE FBI ON NINE

61
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:35,385
SEPARATE OCCASIONS IN HIS

62
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:37,754
INTERVIEWS THAT HE WAS CERTAIN

63
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:39,489
HE WAS WITH THIS OFFICER HENDRIX

64
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:45,962
ON THE 30 SECOND-FLOOR.

65
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:46,729
THEY ALREADY KNEW OFFICER

66
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,165
HENDRIX WAS ON THE 31ST FLOOR

67
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:49,866
BUT, IT WASN'T UNTIL YESTERDAY

68
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:51,768
WHEN ALL OF THAT VIDEO WAS

69
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:52,735
RELEASED THAT WE FINALLY GOT

70
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:54,570
CONFIRMATION THAT SOMETHING IS

71
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:55,772
WRONG, SOMETHING IS AMISS.

72
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:01,377
SCRATCHED THE SURFACE.

73
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:02,178
>> Tucker: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

74
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:03,780
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN

75
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:04,947
SEVERAL MONTHS WE'VE SEEN ARMED

76
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:07,183
POLICE OFFICERS STAND THERE

77
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:09,185
WHILE A MASS MURDER TAKES PLACE.

78
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:10,987
I'M SYMPATHETIC TO COPS BECAUSE

79
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:12,989
THEY TAKE A LOT OF BUT I THINK

80
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,424
WE DESERVE AN EXPLANATION FOR

81
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:15,992
WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING.

82
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,393
>> AS ON MY.

83
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:19,796
ONE LAST THOUGHT ON THAT, I HAVE

84
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:21,831
A CLIENT WHOSE SPOUSE WAS SHOT

85
00:03:27,337 --> 00:00:00,000
AND I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT
