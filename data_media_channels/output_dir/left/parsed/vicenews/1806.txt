hi my name is Neha Shastri and I'm a
journalist at vice news we just released
my piece called contamination nation
which is about how tens of thousands of
Americans on the Navajo Nation are
living without access to clean running
water in their homes due to decades of
uranium mining how long do you think
it's going to take to get everyone water
I'm a nomination I would probably say
it's not any sooner than 50 years out
some people are going to be dead before
they get it this week I'll be joining on
the line to take your questions so if
you have anything that you want to know
about the piece please tweet us with the
hashtag on the line
