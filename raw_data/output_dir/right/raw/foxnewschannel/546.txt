1
00:00:01,542 --> 00:00:01,942
REPUBLICANS.

2
00:00:01,942 --> 00:00:03,110
>> Sean: THAT WAS THE

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,043
PRESIDENT EARLIER TODAY TALKING

4
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:06,680
ABOUT DEMOCRAT DELAY TACTICS IN

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,917
AN OP-ED ON FOXNews.com.

6
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:12,586
HE WROTE "IF NOT JUDGE

7
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:13,454
KAVANAUGH, THEN WHO?

8
00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:16,056
THIS IS THE QUESTION REPUBLICANS

9
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:17,424
NEED TO ASK THEMSELVES AS THEY

10
00:00:17,424 --> 00:00:20,928
PREPARE FOR THE SENATE JUDICIARY

11
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:25,432
HEARING.

12
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:34,441
AND, DIANNE FEINSTEIN LITERALLY

13
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:34,975
HAD THIS IN JULY.

14
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:38,145
SHE DIDN'T BRING IT UP UNTIL

15
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:39,313
NOW.

16
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:40,548
THEN, THE PEOPLE THAT PROFESSOR

17
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:42,116
FORD MENTIONED, ALL OF THEM DENY

18
00:00:42,116 --> 00:00:42,416
IT.

19
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:46,053
THEN YOU HAVE THE NEW YORKER

20
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:47,922
ARTICLE WHERE MS. RAMIREZ ADMITS

21
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,089
SHE WAS INEBRIATED VERY EARLY,

22
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:52,927
SLURRING HER WORDS, GAPS IN HER

23
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,494
MEMORY, ET CETERA.

24
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:56,264
THEN YOU HAVE THE NEW FACE OF

25
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,732
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT SAYS I

26
00:00:57,732 --> 00:00:59,834
WILL REVEAL GANG RATE IN THE

27
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:06,240
NEXT 48 HOURS.

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,512
AND NOW PEOPLE ASSUME THERE IS

29
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:12,713
NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

30
00:01:12,713 --> 00:01:13,781
>> WELL I THINK WHAT THE

31
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:16,050
AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD THINK IS

32
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,152
THAT YOU HAVE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

33
00:01:18,152 --> 00:01:20,154
SO DESPERATE TO STOP THE

34
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:23,090
SUPREME COURT FROM BECOMING

35
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,791
CONSERVATIVE, THAT THEY ARE

36
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:27,962
PREPARED TO LIE, TO SMEAR, TO BE

37
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,264
HYSTERICAL, TO BREAK SENATE

38
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:31,032
RULES, TO DO WHATEVER THEY HAVE

39
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:32,900
TO DO.

40
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,537
WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING IS A PARTY

41
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:38,906
TOTALLY DESPERATE, AND YOU HAVE

42
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:40,741
TO PUT THIS WEEK IN CONTEXT.

43
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:43,277
I WAS STRUCK EARLIER TODAY THAT

44
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:45,446
ARTHUR MILLER'S A GREAT PLAY THE

45
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:46,113
CRUCIBLE WHICH IS ABOUT THE

46
00:01:46,113 --> 00:01:49,150
SALEM WITCHCRAFT TRIALS ACTUALLY

47
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,788
RELATES TO US HAPPENING TO JUDGE

48
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:56,924
WHAT HE IS BEING PRINT       PUT

49
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:56,958
WHAT HE IS BEING PRINT       PUR

50
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:56,991
WHAT HE IS BEING PRINT       PUU

51
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:57,091
WHAT HE IS BEING PRINT       PUH

52
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:53,554
WHAT HE IS BEING PRINT       PUI

53
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:57,124
KAVANAUGH.

54
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:57,725
WHAT HE IS BEING PRINT       PUS

55
00:01:57,725 --> 00:01:58,693
LIKE MEDIEVAL TORTURE.

56
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:00,861
SOMEONE SHOWS UP 35 YEARS LATER,

57
00:02:00,861 --> 00:02:01,929
AND EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE

58
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:03,097
OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

59
00:02:03,097 --> 00:02:05,132
CLOSE YOUR EYES FOR A SECOND,

60
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:09,570
AND ASK WHAT WERE YOU DOING ON

61
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,204
JUNE 12TH, 35 YEARS AGO?

62
00:02:10,204 --> 00:02:13,407
THE TRUTH IS, YOU ALMOST

63
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:14,275
CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW.

64
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:19,714
THE FACT IS, THIS HEARING IS A

65
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:23,518
FARCE.

66
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,218
THERE IS NOTHING KAVANAUGH CAN

67
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:24,819
SAY WHICH WILL CONVINCE

68
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:25,520
CHUCK SCHUMER TO VOTE FOR HIM

69
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,321
AND I THINK THAT DR. FORD AS NO

70
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:28,923
EVIDENCE OTHER THAN HER OWN

71
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:31,125
WORD, WHICH IS GOING TO COUNT --

72
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:38,799
THEY CAN'T PROVIDE ANY WITNESSES

73
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:39,800
AND AND CAN'T EVEN PROVIDE TO

74
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,704
THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, WHAT

75
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:46,374
WAS THE DATE, WHERE WAS THE

76
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:50,044
HOUSE, AND AT WHAT POINT IS THE

77
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,948
BURDEN OF COMMON SENSE ON THE

78
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:56,250
ACCUSER, AND IF IT'S A BURDEN OF

79
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,685
COMMON SENSE, THIS HEARING

80
00:02:57,685 --> 00:03:00,321
WOULDN'T EVEN BE HELD.

81
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:08,997
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SENATOR   T

82
00:03:08,997 --> 00:03:09,097
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SENATOR   E

83
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:09,130
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SENATOR   S

84
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:09,164
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SENATOR   N

85
00:03:09,164 --> 00:02:58,920
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SENATOR   T

86
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:09,197
IT'S ONLY IN THE CURRENT HYPER

87
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:09,431
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SENATOR   R

88
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:20,875
CAN SAY, MEN CAN JUST SHUT UP.

89
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,111
I MEAN, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO

90
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:24,513
AMERICA WHEN RANDOM LEFT-WING

91
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:27,115
TOTALITARIANS THINK THEY CAN

92
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,551
VIOLATE PRIVATE PROPERTY,

93
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:30,685
TRESPASS AND A RESTAURANT, GO IN

94
00:03:30,685 --> 00:03:32,354
AND INTIMIDATE A CITIZEN WHO IS

95
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:34,122
SIMPLY TRYING TO HAVE DINNER,

96
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:36,358
AND THEY THINK THEY ARE HEROES.

97
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:38,026
APPARENTLY, THE POLICE ARE

98
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:39,694
CALLED AND NOBODY IS ARRESTED

99
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:41,530
FOR TRESPASS AND NO ONE IS

100
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,831
ARRESTED FOR INTIMIDATION.

101
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:45,700
WE ARE WATCHING.

102
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,935
WHERE, WHAT WE OUGHT TO

103
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,905
UNDERSTAND IS, THIS IS ABOUT RAW

104
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:50,205
POWER.

105
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:52,874
IF THE LEFT CAN STOP CAVANAUGH,

106
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:54,943
WE WILL NOT GET ANOTHER

107
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,779
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE IN OUR

108
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,947
LIFETIME ON THE SUPREME COURT.

109
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,383
>> Sean: IF YOU TALK ABOUT HIS

110
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:02,885
FOUR DECADES AS AN EXEMPLARY

111
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:06,054
HUSBAND, FATHER, FRIEND.

112
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:08,457
JUDGE, THERE HAVE BEEN OVER 220

113
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,191
PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME OUT AND

114
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:13,028
SAID THIS GUY IS A CUT ABOVE.

115
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:13,695
THE GENTLEMAN'S GENTLEMAN.

116
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:17,099
AND THEN I AM LISTENING TO THESE

117
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,166
LAWMAKERS, MANY OF THEM, WHEN

118
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:22,204
THEY SAY, I BELIEVE IN THE CASE

119
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:24,506
OF PROFESSOR FORD OR

120
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,308
MR. RAMIREZ, BUT WHAT THEY SAY

121
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,342
IS THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN DUE

122
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:29,545
PROCESS OR THE PRESUMPTION OF

123
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:29,912
INNOCENCE.

124
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:32,314
I HAVE TO BE HONEST, HOW DOES A

125
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,917
LAWMAKER SAY HE HAS TO PROVE HIS

126
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:36,151
INNOCENCE?

127
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,321
WE HAVE HAD LAWMAKERS SAY THAT.

128
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,489
SENATOR SAYS HE HAS TO PROVE HIS

129
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:45,327
INNOCENCE FROM 40 YEARS AGO, OR

130
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:45,894
36 YEARS AGO.

131
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,629
>> THERE IS A WHOLE BLOCK OF

132
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:51,333
LEFT-WING DEMOCRATS WHETHER IT'S

133
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,135
SCHUMER OR A VARIETY OF OTHER

134
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:54,870
PEOPLE ON THE LEFT.

135
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,505
THEY ARE HOPELESS.

136
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,707
THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE

137
00:04:58,707 --> 00:04:59,942
TRUTHS, INVOLVED IN THE STRUGGLE

138
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:01,777
OVER POWER AND THEY HAVE TO PAY

139
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:03,679
OFF THEIR ACTIVIST BASE.

140
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,379
THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT

141
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,117
THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR JUDGE

142
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:09,017
KAVANAUGH.

143
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,486
BUT WHAT I'M FASCINATED WITH

144
00:05:10,486 --> 00:05:11,954
HIS, LET'S SAY YOU ARE THE

145
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:14,824
SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA OR

146
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:18,094
MISSOURI OR INDIANA OR

147
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:19,362
NORTH DAKOTA, ARMENTANO, NOW,

148
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:21,264
YOU ARE FROM AN AREA WHERE THERE

149
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:23,733
ARE LOTS OF COMMON SENSE

150
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:26,669
EVERYDAY FOLKS WHO LIKE

151
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:27,303
DONALD TRUMP, WHO BELIEVE

152
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:29,672
DONALD TRUMP IS DOING THE RIGHT

153
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:32,508
THING, WHO WANT TO HAVE A MORE

154
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:33,109
CONSERVATIVE COURT.

155
00:05:33,109 --> 00:05:35,545
LET'S SAY THE JUNIOR SENATOR

156
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:39,082
FROM ALABAMA, DO YOU REALLY WANT

157
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:39,816
TO LINE UP WITH CHUCK SCHUMER

158
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:43,052
AND THE LEFT, WITH BOOKER AND

159
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:50,660
HIS POLE      PATHETIC PORTRAITF

160
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,194
SPARTACUS?

161
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:53,530
AND I BET HE HAD NO IDEA WHO

162
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,731
SPARTACUS WAS.

163
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,699
I THINK THESE SENATORS WHO ARE

164
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,134
FROM STATES THAT HAVE A LOT OF

165
00:05:58,134 --> 00:06:00,070
COMMON SENSE AND A LOT OF

166
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,106
CONSERVATISM, A DESIRE FOR MORE

167
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:04,707
CONSERVATIVE JUDGES, WE HAVE NOT

168
00:06:04,707 --> 00:06:05,909
HEARD A SINGLE ONE OF THEM YET

169
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:06,910
AND I WILL BE VERY SURPRISED IF

170
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,244
WE DON'T HAVE A NUMBER OF THEM

171
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:11,414
VOTE YES.

172
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:13,917
REMEMBER, WHEN THE CLARENCE

173
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:14,617
THOMAS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION

174
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:18,488
WAS UNDERWAY, 11 DEMOCRATS ENDED

175
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:19,155
UP VOTING YES FOR CLARENCE

176
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:19,489
THOMAS.

177
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:25,895
AND I THINK WE MAY FIND ALL OF A

178
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:27,931
SUDDEN, THAT SEVERAL OF THESE

179
00:06:27,931 --> 00:06:29,099
DEMOCRATS FROM TRUMP STATES

180
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:30,333
DECIDED IN THE END.

181
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,302
YOU KNOW, SHE DIDN'T PROVE HER

182
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:35,305
CASE, I'M GOING TO VOTE YES.

183
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:36,406
HE DESERVES TO BE ON THE COURT.

184
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:38,808
>> Sean: HE ALSO HAS A 40 YEAR

185
00:06:38,808 --> 00:06:39,242
TRACK RECORD.

186
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:42,145
I THINK YOUR OBSERVATION IS

187
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:42,979
RIGHT, 42 DAYS IN THE ELECTION,

188
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:45,181
I CAN TELL YOU THAT PEOPLE THAT

189
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:47,183
I HEAR FROM THREE HOURS PER DAY

190
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:48,885
ON RADIO THAT WATCH THE SHOW,

191
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:52,122
THEY ARE ANGRY.

192
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:53,890
INSTINCTIVELY AMERICANS BELIEVE

193
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,526
IN DUE PROCESS, THEY BELIEVE IN

194
00:06:56,526 --> 00:07:01,931
FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS, AND WE

195
00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:08,404
BELIEVE IN HIGH-PROFILE CASES,

196
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:10,140
AND WE ARE SEEING A RUSH TO

197
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,274
JUDGMENT WITH A LOT OF THE SAME

198
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,910
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WRONG AGAIN AND

199
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:31,028
AGAIN, AND THOSE FOUR PEOPLE

200
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:31,461
HAVE CONTROL.

201
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:32,162
THAT WOULD BE BOB CORKER, THAT

202
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:32,696
WOULD BE JEFF FLAKE.

203
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:33,397
I THINK SUSAN COLLINS PROBABLY

204
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:34,131
HAD THE BEST COMMENT OF ANYBODY

205
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:34,831
SAYING, WHAT DIANNE FEINSTEIN

206
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:35,532
DID WAS UNFAIR TO EVERYBODY IN

207
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:38,101
THIS CASE, AND, LISA MURKOWSKI,

208
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:38,902
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM

209
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:42,706
ANY OF THEM TONIGHT.

210
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:45,108
>> I DON'T EITHER.

211
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:46,810
THURSDAY IS IMPORTANT IN THE

212
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:56,586
FACT THAT UNLESS DR. FORD IS

213
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:08,398
I'M GUESSING ALL FOUR OF THE   T

214
00:08:08,398 --> 00:07:51,348
I'M GUESSING ALL FOUR OF THE   E

215
00:07:51,348 --> 00:08:08,432
OVERWHELMINGLY CONVINCING AND

216
00:08:08,432 --> 00:08:08,665
I'M GUESSING ALL FOUR OF THE   M

217
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:09,366
WILL REALIZE THERE IS NO CASE

218
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:09,900
ADEQUATE TO SAY NO.

219
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,567
AT THE SAME TIME, I BELIEVE

220
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:11,301
THERE ARE FIVE OR SIX DEMOCRATS

221
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:11,968
ON THE BUBBLE WHO HAVE TO GO

222
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:12,869
HOME AND EXPLAIN WHY THEY VOTED

223
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,304
WITH SCHUMER AND WITH A WARRANT

224
00:08:14,304 --> 00:08:17,941
AND WHY THEY VOTED WITH BOOKER.

225
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:19,209
AND I THINK THAT THIS COULD BE A

226
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:23,113
VERY EXPENSIVE VOTE IN TERMS OF

227
00:08:23,113 --> 00:08:25,849
DEFEATING FIVE, SIX OR SEVEN

228
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:26,550
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE I THINK THE

229
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,951
STATES WILL SAY TO THEM, THERE

230
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:33,623
IS NO PROOF HERE THAT JUSTIFIES

231
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:34,924
VOTING NO ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

232
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:36,326
>> Sean: MR. SPEAKER, WE

233
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:37,294
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

234
00:08:37,294 --> 00:08:38,962
SORRY YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT HERE.

235
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:40,731
YOU ARE IN D.C. AND YOU COULDN'T

236
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,032
EVEN COME SEE US.

237
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:44,534
WE ARE OUTSIDE ON THE CAPITAL IS

238
00:08:44,534 --> 00:00:00,000
BEHIND US, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
