00:00:05,257 --> 00:00:07,159
â™ª

2
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:08,727
>> SOLVED BY MANY OTHERS.

3
00:00:08,727 --> 00:00:10,295
I'M NOT JUST SAYING

4
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:10,963
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

5
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:12,431
I'M SAYING OTHER PRESIDENTS.

6
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:13,699
LONG TIME AGO THIS COULD

7
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:15,400
HAVE BEEN SOLVED IN A LOT

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,535
EASIER MANNER.

9
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:18,670
AND A LOT LESS DANGEROUS

10
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,404
MANNER.

11
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:21,206
BUT IT WASN'T, SO I WILL

12
00:00:21,206 --> 00:00:22,908
SOLVE IT.

13
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:23,642
BRIAN: THERE WAS A SENSE

14
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:24,810
THAT THINGS WERE GETTING

15
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,378
CLOSE IN THE PAST BUT 70

16
00:00:26,378 --> 00:00:27,312
YEARS LATER WE STILL DON'T

17
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:28,046
HAVE A DEAL.

18
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:29,548
WILL WE GET A DEAL NOW.

19
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:30,282
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP GETS

20
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:32,217
READY FOR THE SUMMIT WITH

21
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:33,585
KING NEXT WEEK IT APPEARS

22
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:34,653
OTHER GLOBAL PLAYERS ARE

23
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:36,021
TRYING TO GET IN THE ACTION.

24
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:37,956
LOOK AT THIS ROSTER HERE.

25
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,391
HERE TO BREAK IT DOWN SENIOR

26
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:41,326
FELLOW FOR THE DEFENSE OF

27
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:41,693
DEMOCRACY.

28
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:43,896
ANTHONY SPENT YEARS WORKING

29
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:45,898
ON NONPROLIFERATION AT THE

30
00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:47,199
STATE DEPARTMENT NOT EASY.

31
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:48,400
LET'S MAKE SENSE OF IT.

32
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,101
ANTHONY, THANKS SO MUCH.

33
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:50,068
HERE ARE THE PLAYERS.

34
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:51,003
LET'S GET STARTED.

35
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:52,304
FIRST GUY WE WANT TO TAKE A

36
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:52,771
LOOK AT.

37
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:53,805
LEADERRED OF SOUTH KOREA.

38
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:54,706
WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT

39
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:54,973
HIM?

40
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:56,708
>> I THINK PRESIDENT MOON

41
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:57,776
WANTS THE TALKS TO CONTINUE

42
00:00:57,776 --> 00:00:58,310
WITH KIM.

43
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,045
HE HAS ALREADY MET KIM

44
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:00,345
TWICE.

45
00:01:00,345 --> 00:01:01,513
THERE IS RUMORS THAT MOON

46
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:03,081
MAY JOIN THE SUMMIT ON THE

47
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:05,183
SECOND DAY IF THERE IS

48
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:05,984
ANYTHING ON THE PEACE

49
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:08,921
TREATY.

50
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:09,888
BRIAN: ARE OUR OBJECTIVES

51
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,289
THE SAME?

52
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,057
>> FOR THE MOST PART.

53
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:14,793
ALTHOUGH MOON WANTS THE

54
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:15,627
INTERKOREAN SUMMIT IN THE

55
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:16,328
WORST WAY.

56
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:18,530
HE MAY FORCE TRUMP TO TRY TO

57
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,165
GET A BAD DEAL.

58
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:20,799
BRIAN: THIS IS THE WHOLE

59
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,733
DEAL HE HAD.

60
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:23,635
HE IS CONSIDERED MORE

61
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:24,102
LIBERAL.

62
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:26,305
REPLACED A CONSERVATIVE.

63
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:29,841
JAPAN SHINZO ABE, WHAT DOES

64
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:30,709
HE WANT?

65
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:32,177
>> TWO THINGS HE WANTS IS A

66
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:34,446
MISSILE DEAL AND ON

67
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:34,813
ABDUCTEES.

68
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:36,081
>> TO REMOVE ALL?

69
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:38,884
>> TO HAVE THE ABDUCTEES

70
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:39,351
COME BACK.

71
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,385
I THINK HE IS WORRIED THAT

72
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:41,653
THE UNITED STATES WILL GET A

73
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:43,689
LONG RANGE MISSILE DEAL AND

74
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:44,456
NOT FOCUS ON THE MISSILES

75
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:46,358
THAT ARE TARGETED AT JAPAN.

76
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:47,926
BRIAN: DOES HE WANT OUR

77
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:48,594
TROOPS TO STAY.

78
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:51,196
>> YES, DEFINITELY.

79
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:51,630
BRIAN: 38,000?

80
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,831
>> IN SOUTH KOREA AND TROOPS

81
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,934
IN JAPAN AS WELL INCLUDING

82
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:56,501
AIRCRAFT CARRIER.

83
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:57,703
BRIAN: CHINA, WHAT DO THEY

84
00:01:57,703 --> 00:01:58,003
WANT?

85
00:01:58,003 --> 00:01:59,071
THIS IS THEIR ALLY THEY WANT

86
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:00,973
TO KEEP IT COMMUNIST.

87
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:02,107
>> OVERALL THE CHINESE WANT

88
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:04,142
THE U.S. OUT OF EAST ASIA

89
00:02:04,142 --> 00:02:05,377
BUT REDUCE TRUMP'S LEVERAGE

90
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:07,012
IN THE TALKS.

91
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:08,280
BRIAN: HOW DOES TRUMP'S

92
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,348
LEVERAGE GET REDUCED IN THE

93
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:09,648
TALKS?

94
00:02:09,648 --> 00:02:11,116
>> THEY ARE ALLOWING THE

95
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:11,883
SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH

96
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:14,252
KOREA TO BE LOOSENED BY

97
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:14,753
CHINA.

98
00:02:14,753 --> 00:02:15,721
BRIAN: OVER THE LAST COUPLE

99
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:16,088
OF MONTHS?

100
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:18,090
>> OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

101
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,490
MONTHS.

102
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,891
BRIAN: WE HAVE SANCTIONS

103
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,426
READY TO GO.

104
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:23,528
NOW, OUT OF NOWHERE, LAVROV

105
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:24,463
GOES TO VISIT.

106
00:02:24,463 --> 00:02:25,530
VLADIMIR PUTIN PROMISES A

107
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:25,864
SUMMIT.

108
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:26,765
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

109
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:28,266
>> YEAH, I MEAN THE RUSSIANS

110
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,901
HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST

111
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:33,372
SANCTION BUSTERS IN THE ERA

112
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:34,373
OF MAXIMUM PRESSURE.

113
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:36,041
THEY WANT TO PLAY A SPOILER

114
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:36,341
ROLE.

115
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:37,743
THEY ALSO WANT THE UNITED

116
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:39,878
STATES OUT OF EAST ASIA.

117
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:40,512
BRIAN: I JUST WOULD SAY

118
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:40,812
THIS.

119
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:43,915
I THINK IN ONE WAY THEY AND

120
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:45,283
CHINA ENJOYED BEING THE ONLY

121
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:45,984
ALLIES IN THE AREA.

122
00:02:45,984 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY JUST DON'T LIKE THE
