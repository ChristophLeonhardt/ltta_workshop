00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,000
Trump’s attorney, former
New York City mayor –

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,375
I’ve been sitting here looking
at the federal code trying

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,290
to find collusion as a crime.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,879
It’s not. Collusion
is not a crime.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,740
He tape recorded
conversations of his clients.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,230
He was shaking people down for
money. Like George Washington

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,170
didn’t know that Benedict
Arnold was a traitor.

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,660
Like Iago betrayed Othello. And Brutus put

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,920
the last knife into Caesar.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,770
So you say it
cuts off abruptly and

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,760
you think that’s
a smoking gun.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,330
We’ve already heard the – 
I don’t know that it’s smoking gun,

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,870
I just know that you
don’t do that with a tape,

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,630
and expect that it’s going to 
be admitted into evidence.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,838
But that’s not doctored; that’s
a tape recorder turning off.

16
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,850
Hold that thought, Mr. Mayor.

17
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,140
No, no,

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,389
I’m going to leave after this.

19
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:05,062
What, we’ve scared you away?
Oh yeah, you scared me away.

20
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:06,020
I looked really scared.

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,010
No. It’s starting to get useless.
No.

22
00:01:08,010 --> 00:00:00,000
This conversation is getting really, really, 
really petty and silly.
