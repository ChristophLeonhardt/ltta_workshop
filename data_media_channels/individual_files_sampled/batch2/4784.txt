NBC News correspondent Gabe Gutierrez is on the border in Brownsville Texas near one of those tender age shelters and MSNBC capital correspondent Garrett Haake is of course in the middle of the action in Congress Gabe let me start with you you look at the Border Patrol the head of the Border Patrol told me on Friday that if given the order they could move immediately but what's not clear is what do we do Etro actively what have you learned so far oh hi there Chuck well yes as you were talking with Pete the big question right now is how will these children be reunited with those family members immigration activists say that's not going to be possible that quickly or a long as some authorities would have us believe now we're here in front of a so-called tender-age shelter a Casa Presidente here in Brownsville Texas and Chuck speaking with a congressman who toured this facility earlier his name is Philemon bela he says that this is not what the The Associated Press article seems to suggest that these tender-age shelters are entirely children under the age of 10 this shelter in particular has about 80 children according to the congressman ranging the ranging in age from less than one year old to teenagers about half of them or so he says were separated from their parents and I want to redo his account of what he says he saw when he toured this facility earlier this week he says in one room there were about eight boys and girls ages ranging from three to five years old they were essentially being instructed as you would see in any preschool class but the other room and he was taken into had four infants all under the age of one now two of those were with their mothers he says teenage girls the two others were one year old in eight month old one of them had been separated from her sister in somewhere along the way their mother had died the other infant had been separated from her mother is what he was told and he saw that they were being fed by the personnel in this in this facility he said the facility itself was very clean but the question he has is you know why these children were separated from their parents in the first place but as you said Chuck now that these children have been taken to 14 states New York alone Mayor Bill DeBlasio saying that 200 children have been taken to to New York alone what happens with these children and with children this young how do you get information on who their parents are how logistically you manage this reunification process and that still needs to be ironed out in the coming day it's Chuck and you just I mean you just already heard about from the congressman you have one whose mother died on the trek I mean that just only adds to those complication right Gabe Gutierrez thank you very much I know you've got some work to do for night let me go to turn to Garrett up on Capitol Hill so Garrett obviously the president in the order essentially talks Congress to get something done on this frankly the the court case that orders children sort of that that the president claimed was tying his hands in the first place is something Congress has to address are they ready to address it is it going to be standalone or they still gonna try to insert it into a bigger immigration bill well Chuck they're gonna try to address it there's probably one and a half plans from the original half a dozen or so we were talking about last night floating around here on the Senate side the one that seems to probably have the most Ramona might now is one led by Tom Tillis that has more than a dozen Republican senators signed onto it including the Majority Leader Mitch McConnell it looks a lot like what Ted Cruz had proposed earlier in the week it adds immigration judges to speed up the process it mandates that families be kept together and kept together in family shelters not in things like that converted Walmart that we've seen all those horrifying pictures of earlier this week that's the one piece of legislation looks like it's ready to go in the Senate earlier this evening you had a group of bipartisan senators everyone from Dianne Feinstein to Ted Cruz meeting in Susan Collins office to try to hatch through whether perhaps there's something else that the Senate can do on a bipartisan basis because several senators I talked to do recognize the fact that this immigration or this executive order rather really only buys them time it is absolutely not a lasting solution the house side is a whole other problem check they're trying to deal with these two broad-based immigration bills they're supposed to have votes on tomorrow night both of which look like they're in trouble despite the White House working very hard today you have been skeptical Republicans that this is what they need to vote for I'm curious Garrett I mean III got the sneaking suspicion that one of the reasons the president caved on this is that he figured if he didn't it made it even him that much harder to get any of those bills passed tomorrow is that why he may have tried to get this out of the way to see if he could have a better shot at passing one one bill in the house well I try to stay out of the President's head Chuck but I do think there is a feeling among Republican lawmakers here that this now gives them something to vote for right they feel like if they vote for one of these two bills likely the leadership build is supposedly this compromise bill it gives them a pathway out of this look they can say we're helping the president with the priority of his we're helping end this border separation never mind who may have started it never mind that the president started essentially with this policy but it does give Republicans who may not have otherwise felt strongly about this issue or may have been concerned that the president might roll back on them and accuse them or their base might accuse them of voting for amnesty a reason to say look we're gonna vote for this because we see this as an issue these separations that need to be addressed but again that just might not be enough the house continues to have these two bills be moving targets that it's very unclear if there's enough support to get either one of them across the finish line yeah and as we know it's already been said dead on arrival in the Senate especially in an election year when Mitch McConnell's trying to win a bunch of rural red states anyway gerd egg on Capitol fours thank you hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by
