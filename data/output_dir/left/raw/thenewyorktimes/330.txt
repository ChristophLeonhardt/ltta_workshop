1
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,380
This is Charlie.

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,570
He was just born.

3
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,800
These are his parents
Jenny and Greg.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,300
In 20 years, Greg will be dead.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,460
But Charlie doesn’t
know that yet.

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,492
Charlie doesn’t
know anything yet.

7
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:34,050
He’s just a baby.

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,130
This is where Charlie grew
up, his brother Geoff,

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,660
sister Meg, their dog Louie, and
the TV room where his dad hid

10
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,580
these, some of the tackiest
video pornography of the 1980s

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,179
had to offer.

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,640
Greg will be dead in 10 years.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,350
But Charlie still
doesn’t know that yet.

14
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,967
This is Charlie’s first
project from film school.

15
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,550
Evidently, he loaded
the camera wrong,

16
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,590
so the footage
came out like this.

17
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,890
So he never showed his dad.

18
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,240
Greg will be dead in one year,
but Charlie still doesn’t know.

19
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,750
Charlie has a ticket to
see his favorite band.

20
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,640
It’s the same day
that his dad tells him

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,820
he’s gotten a diagnosis.

22
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,320
But he insists that Charlie
go to the concert and not

23
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,160
to worry.

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,810
So Charlie isn’t worried.

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,210
He doesn’t even know
what malignant means.

26
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,880
Then just before
Greg’s 52nd birthday —

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,460
[ring]

28
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,260
Charlie’s mom calls to
tell him that his dad has

29
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,400
been hospitalized and
is basically comatose.

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,390
She explains, as delicately
as she can …

31
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,200
“This is to the end.”

32
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,090
At his hospital
bed, Charlie thinks

33
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,010
his dad gives him a smile.

34
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,600
Greg can’t speak anymore.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,757
So they sit in silence.

36
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:11,590
In truth, this is not
so different from when

37
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,077
Greg was healthy.

38
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:15,160
They didn’t agree on much
and so they never really

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,030
spent time together.

40
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,980
But Charlie was
waiting for the moment

41
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,550
when they could see
each other as adults.

42
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,650
He knew that was when
the strange distance he

43
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,913
felt between them
would finally close.

44
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:27,765
But then —

45
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:31,480
[beep]

46
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,910
This is Charlie’s dad today.

47
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,550
He’s been dead for nine years.

48
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,310
In the aftermath, a life’s
worth of weird stuff

49
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,090
is left behind, stuff that
Charlie hoped might explain

50
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,370
why his dad was the way he was.

51
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,230
Like maybe if Charlie
looked hard enough,

52
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,240
he could bring him
back from the dead,

53
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,750
at least long enough to
understand who he really was.

54
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,862
So it’s a pretty stupid plan,
but this is him trying anyway.

55
00:02:56,862 --> 00:02:58,305
[music]

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,520
Gregory Allen Tyrell was
born November 14th, 1956,

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,410
in Hamilton, Ontario.

58
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,840
Parents, Dale and Stan.

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,210
Along with Greg, they’d all die
within a year of each other.

60
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,500
Dale was the last holdout.

61
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,300
Greg was a police officer.

62
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,930
He’d work long shifts
an hour from home.

63
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,682
But it was a job he kept
pretty tight-lipped about.

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,920
OK.

65
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,810
Being a cop just paid the bills.

66
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,030
So what did Greg choose to do?

67
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,160
Well he flew airplanes
in his spare time.

68
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,880
He’d often drag Charlie
to airstrips on weekends,

69
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,610
but always ended up chatting
with the other pilots for hours

70
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,620
while Charlie, bored
out of his mind,

71
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,810
would leave to wait in the car.

72
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,590
He fixed planes too.

73
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,270
He loved fixing things.

74
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,310
He left behind a
junkyard of tools.

75
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,190
And their house was in a
constant state of renovation,

76
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,920
right up until his death.

77
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,090
But what did any of this mean?

78
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:24,352
Greg: “So this is our —

79
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:31,015
[chuckles] not done yet kitchen,
12 years in the making, this.

80
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:33,810
This is our front hallway.

81
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,488
What a vast improvement.

82
00:04:36,488 --> 00:04:38,298
It’s actually quite nice.”

83
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,320
“Well, I do nice
trim work, don’t I?”

84
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,710
He was pathologically
protective of his stuff.

85
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,730
Anything misused, misplaced,
or presumably used in a movie

86
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,050
would make him erupt.

87
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,490
So far this is going very badly.

88
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,110
It looks like
everything in this pile

89
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,810
is just as elusive as Greg was.

90
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,220
It’s just trivia.

91
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,630
Greg was hard to live with.

92
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,230
Greg had a volatile temper.

93
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,730
So what?

94
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,790
Unexamined for all
these years, this stuff

95
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,610
could have hidden
anything — revelations,

96
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,700
answers, catharsis.

97
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,600
Examined, it’s
looking more and more

98
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,870
like a big pile of nothing.

99
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,050
And he’s gone all the way
from birth certificate

100
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,650
to cancer diagnosis.

101
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,830
The doctors told Greg that
the most common causes

102
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,670
of this kind of cancer were
smoking, drinking, and stress.

103
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,210
Greg didn’t smoke
and he didn’t drink.

104
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,820
They nicknamed the tumor Dale.

105
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,190
So maybe Charlie’s been
looking in the wrong place.

106
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,920
Dale threw cocktail parties.

107
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,870
Stan was a pilot.

108
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,940
On the surface, they looked
like a pretty typical

109
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,310
well-adjusted family.

110
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,790
This was their house, a
monument to a respectable brand

111
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,260
of normalcy.

112
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,820
Dale’s cocktail
parties were showcases.

113
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,130
Her kids were props.

114
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,870
On Christmas mornings,
she would march

115
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,000
them downstairs in
matching uniforms

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,700
and make them write long
thank-you cards immediately

117
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:42,280
after every gift was unwrapped
to Santa, every single time.

118
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,130
Greg had a speech
impediment back then.

119
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,920
Dale would reluctantly drive
him to corrective lessons,

120
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,065
bullying him the whole
time

121
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:09,960
about what a burden
he was on her.

122
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,470
Decades later,
nothing had changed.

123
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,410
Charlie remembers how reticent
his dad got every time

124
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,419
they went to her house for
the mandatory holiday visits.

125
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,904
And then Charlie found this.

126
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:52,060
No, it’s something we
have to be aware of.

127
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:26,890
Every time you try to —

128
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,100
For a split second, it’s
like Charlie has his answer.

129
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,970
But all he’s really done is move
the question back a generation.

130
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,210
If she made him this
way, what made her?

131
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,080
A pattern starts to emerge.

132
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,690
But rather than see
how far back it goes,

133
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,390
Charlie focuses back on himself.

134
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,770
When Charlie was
a kid, he wasn’t

135
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,760
living in an abusive household.

136
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,240
He was just trying to avoid
another visit to the airstrip

137
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,600
with his dad, his
dad who was only trying

138
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,810
in his own naive and awkward
way to just spend time

139
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,400
with his son.

140
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,960
This wasn’t Greg failing.

141
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,630
This was Greg trying.

142
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,890
He just kind of sucked at it.

143
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,400
A cycle of abuse, echoing
from Dale’s father to her, to him,

144
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,450
left Greg hard and bitter.

145
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,415
But at some point,
he made a decision.

146
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,470
He was going to stop it
from going any further.

147
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,342
I’m dressing up for my
daughter’s birthday.

148
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:24,112
Get the wide angle
going to get this shape.

149
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:29,181
[chuckling]
Funny…

150
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:33,220
You wanna watch
me brush my teeth?

151
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,030
“Sure.”

152
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,000
And after all those years
Charlie spent avoiding him,

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,760
Greg still supported Charlie’s
filmmaking ambitions.

154
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,470
And Charlie wasted all that
time at the airfield hiding out

155
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,990
in the car, like he
wasted so much time

156
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,650
combing through his dad’s crap,
clinging onto VHS porno tapes

157
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,960
like they were part
of this puzzle.

158
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,170
But Greg was never defined
by what he carried with him.

159
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,380
He was defined by what,
after multiple generations,

160
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,690
he was finally able to let go.

161
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,480
His loving and devoted wife
who would have happily spent

162
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,040
the rest of her life with him —

163
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,310
His son Geoff, now a father
to his own perfect impossible

164
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,810
kids.

165
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,110
His daughter Meg, who shares his
stubbornness, if nothing else.

166
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,410
And his youngest
son Charlie, the one

167
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,228
who thought his dad could
be a dick sometimes,

168
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:25,000
who felt like there always
was, and now always will be,

169
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,560
a distance between them.

170
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,830
But he still ends every single
movie he makes the same way,

171
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,500
even though his dad will never
see it, a single credit all

172
00:12:48,500 --> 00:00:00,000
by itself that reads —
