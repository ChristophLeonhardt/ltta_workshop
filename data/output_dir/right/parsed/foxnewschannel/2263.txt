>> Martha: INTERESTING
DEVELOPMENT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
MEETING ON NORTH KOREAN LEADER
KIM JOHN GONE AND WHERE IT MIGHT
TAKE PLACE.
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT VARIOUS
COUNTRIES INCLUDING SINGAPORE
AND WE ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT
THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DMZ.
I THINK SOME PEOPLE MAY BE MIGHT
NOT LOOK SO MUCH LIKE THE LOOK
AT THAT AND I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.
I THREW IT OUT AS AN IDEA.
THERE IS SOMETHING I LIKE ABOUT
IT BECAUSE YOU ARE THERE.
YOU'RE ACTUALLY THERE.
IF THINGS WORK OUT, THERE IS A
GREAT CELEBRATION TO BE HAD ON
THE SITE, NOT IN A THIRD-PARTY
COUNTRY.
>> Martha: INTERESTING, RIGHT?
THIS IS NORTH KOREAN LEADERS
KIM JONG UN BEGINNING TO SOFTEN
HIS TONE, TELLING SOUTH KOREANS
THAT, "I KNOW THE AMERICANS ARE
INHERENTLY DISPOSE WITH US, BUT
WHEN THEY TALK WITH US THEY WILL
SEE I'M NOT THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO WILL SHOOT YOU NUCLEAR
WEAPONS TO THE SOUTH, OVER THE
SPECIFIC, OR AT THE
UNITED STATES."
THE GUY WHO WAS ONCE DUBBED
"LITTLE ROCKET MAN" BY TRUMP MAY
ACTUALLY BE SPEAKING THE
LANGUAGE OF A PEACEMAKER, AT
LEAST AT THIS POINT.
I SAT DOWN WITH SOUTH CAROLINA
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM, A MEMBER
OF THE ARMED SERVICES AND
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
WATCH.
FIRST OF ALL, ON THE LOCATION.
DO YOU AGREE WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE DMZ IS THE
BEST PLACE TO DO THIS?
>> THE WAR HAS NEVER ENDED.
WE ARE IN A PLACE OF HIS
HOSTILITIES.
I LIKE THE IDEA OF WHERE THE
ARMISTICE WAS SIGNED IS WHERE
YOU END THE WAR.
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT, PEACE
OR WAR IS NOT YOUR OPTION.
THERE IS NO MIDDLE GROUND.
>> Martha: IF THIS DOES NOT
WORK OUT IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT
TALKED ABOUT.
HE SAID I WILL MEET WITH HIM.
IF HE DOESN'T GIVE US WHAT WE
WANT WHICH IS A REAL GUARANTEE,
A VERIFIABLE GUARANTEE THAT THEY
ARE DENUCLEARIZE.
NOT THAT THEY WILL, RIGHT?
THAT IS THE DEAL.
>> KIM JONG UN IS PLAYING WITH
FIRE.
IF HE WANTS TO MEET WITH TRUMP
AND HE DOESN'T DELIVER AND HE
TRIES TO PLAY TRUMP LIKE HIS
FAMILY HAS PLAYED OTHER
PRESIDENTS, THAT'S THE WORST
THING HE CAN DO.
THIS PRESIDENT IS SERIOUS ABOUT
MAKING SURE THEY WILL NEVER HAVE
A NUCLEAR WEAPON TO HIT THE
HOMELAND.
SIGNING A PEACE TREATY FOR
GIVING UP NORTH KOREAN NUKES
MAKES SENSE.
TRUMP SHOULD GET THE NOBEL PEACE
PRIZE IF THAT HAPPENS.
BUT DON'T PLAY TRUMP.
WE ARE GOING TO PLAY NICE WITH
NORTH KOREA.
>> Martha: CAN HE GET SOME
KIND OF PROTECTION PROMISE
BECAUSE HE LOOKS AT WHAT
HAPPENED TO QADDAFI AND THAT'S A
CONCERN FOR THE DEAR LEADER.
>> THE DEAR LEADER HAS A CHOICE
TO MAKE.
BEFORE HE THOUGHT THE BEST PLACE
TO SURVIVE IS TO HAVE A WEAPON
THAT CAN HIT AMERICA, AND ALONG
COMES TRUMP.
TRUMP SAYS HE'LL NEVER LET HIM
HAVE ACTIVE ABILITY.
AN UNDERSTANDING HE WILL END THE
WAR, BETWEEN SOUTH KOREA, U.S.,
CHINA, UNITED STATES.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO INVADE
NORTH KOREA, BUT HAVING A TREE
TO RECOMMENDING THEM AS A
SEPARATE COUNTRY, TRY TO
NORMALIZE RELATIONSHIPS, AND FOR
THAT YOU HAVE TO GO TO YOUR
NUKES.
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD DEAL FOR
EVERYBODY.
>> Martha: I DO WANT TO PLAY
SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOU.
THIS IS BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, THE
PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL TODAY.
LET'S WATCH.
>> THE WRONG DEAL, THE NUCLEAR
>> THE IRAN DEAL WITH A NUCLEAR
DEAL, IS BASED ON LIES.
IT'S BASED ON A RAINY AND
DECEPTION.
IN A FEW DAYS' TIME,
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL DECIDE,
WILL MAKE A DECISION ON WHAT TO
DO WITH THE NUCLEAR DEAL.
I'M SURE HE WILL DO THE RIGHT
THING.
THE RIGHT THING FOR THE
UNITED STATES.
THE RIGHT THING FOR ISRAEL.
AND THE RIGHT THING FOR THE
PEACE OF THE WORLD.
>> Martha: HE SAYS THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE
CONTINUED ELEMENTS OF THE
PROGRAM.
THIS IS FROM THE FOREIGN
MINISTER IN IRAN.
HE SAYS, "TRUMP IS JUMPING ON A
REHASH OF OLD ALLEGATIONS
ALREADY DOUBT WITH THE IAEA.
OUR COORDINATED RENOVATIONS BY
THE BOY WHO CRIES WOLF BEFORE
MAY 12, BUT TRUMP'S AND PENSION
WINDS TO CELEBRATE BLUE THE
COVER."
>> IN THE PAST, HAVE YOU TRIED
TO BUILD A NUCLEAR WEAPON, THEY
WILL SAY NO, THEY ARE LIARS.
YOU DON'T BUILD OUR PLANS AT THE
BOTTOM OF A MOUNTAIN.
THEY HAD A NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
THEY WERE TESTING WEAPONS, A
DETONATION DEVICE, ON A MILITARY
BASE.
THEIR WHOLE PROGRAM WAS TO GET A
NUCLEAR WEAPON.
WHAT WOULD THEY DO WITH IT?
THEY'VE BEEN LYING ABOUT THEIR
AMBITIONS TOWARD A NUCLEAR
WEAPON.
BUT THEY ARE NOT LYING ABOUT
WHAT THEY WOULD DO.
THEY WRITE ON TO THEIR MISSILES,
DEATH TO ISRAEL, DEATH TO
AMERICA.
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE
AYATOLLAH IS A RELIGIOUS.
THIS GUY IS A RELIGIOUS
FANATIC.
THE DAY WE VOTED ON THE NUCLEAR
DEAL IN THE SENATE, HE TWEETED
OUT, A LA WILLING, THE ZIONIST
STATE WILL NOT EXIST 25 YEARS
FROM NOW.
SO WE
-- IT'S TERRIBLE FOR ISRAEL, THE
ARABS, AND US.
I WOULD GET OUT IF I COULD NOT
GET A BETTER DEAL.
>> Martha: DO YOU THINK THERE
IS ANY APPETITE IN WASHINGTON TO
REDO THIS DEAL IN A BIPARTISAN
WAY?
>> YES.
>> Martha: REALLY?
>> TRUMP SAID THREE THINGS NEED
TO CHANGE TO MAKE IT A GOOD
DEAL.
YOU CAN EXPECT ANYWHERE IN IRAN
INCLUDING THEIR NUCLEAR BASES,
SO THEY CANNOT ALLOW ACCESS TO A
MILITARY BASES.
THE MISSILE PROGRAM HAS TO BE
PART OF THE DEAL.
THE SUNSET CLAUSE, 50 YEARS FROM
NOW ALL THE INSPECTORS LEAVE
IRAN AND THEY CAN MARCH TOWARD A
NUCLEAR WEAPON WITHOUT
ACHIEVING, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE
THOSE THREE THINGS FOR THE ONE
THING THAT I MAY SAY TO MY
DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUES.
YOU MAY HAVE DONE THIS IN GOOD
FAKERY YOU THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE
A BETTER NATION.
THEY HAVE CAPTURED OUR SAILORS
ON THE HIGH SEA AND EMULATED
THEM SINCE THE DEAL.
THEY TESTFIRED WEAPONS IN
VIOLATION OF THE U.N. REVOLUTION
VIOLATION OF THE U.N. REVOLUTIO
REVOLUTION.
THEY HAVE DISMEMBERED SYRIA.
THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER YEMEN.
THEY CONSTANTLY THREATEN ISRAEL,
THREATEN ISRAEL.
THEY HAVE GIVEN HAS BELOW
160,000 ROCKETS.
EVERYTHING THEY'VE DONE SINCE
THE DEAL SHOWS THEY DO NOT WANT
PEACE, THEY REALLY HAVE A WAR
AGENDA.
>> YOU THINK THERE WILL BE
DEMOCRATS COMING TO THE TABLE IN
THAT?
>> CHRIS SAID HE WAS RIGHT FOR
TRUMP TO MAKE -- IF YOU DO NOT
GET BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S
DESIRE TO GET BEHIND, I WILL
WORK WITH YOU TO ASK THE
PRESIDENT TO GIVE THEM 90 MORE
DAYS INSTEAD OF WITHDRAWING ON
MAY THE 12TH, IF I CAN GET
DEMOCRATS TO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF
THE DEAL NEEDS TO BE CHANGE, I
WOULD ASK THE PRESIDENT TO GIVE
US 90 DAYS, POMPEO, 90 DAYS
AFTER MAY 12 TO SEE IF THE
EUROPEANS CAN COME ON BOARD TO
THE FRENCH.
