Hilary Clinton does the same thing so we former first lady senator presidential candidate she says listen as an American I'm worried about the level of our rhetoric well as a person I'm great as an American I'm worried I worry about the direction of our country I worry about what kind of world we'll be waiting for them when they're teenagers and young adults and beyond okay and it wasn't just telling Clinton saying this her top aide Philippe Raines who is really one of the most vicious people in American politics he was on MSNBC and he explicitly just blamed President Trump's rhetoric for all of this this is someone who has weaponized Trump's Twitter feed and made it into a hit list he is addicted to their response and their response they are addicted to his vitriol okay so next time somebody who's a big Hillary Clinton fan decides to go and shoot up in office or invade a Fox News studio then I guess we can blame Hillary Clinton because after all I recall when a minute ago one minute ago Hillary Clinton was saying you cannot be civil with the other side okay this is legitimately what's the date today today is the 25th okay so legitimately 24 14 days ago 15 days ago Hillary Clinton said this you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and/or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength okay everybody is completely full of crap everyone is completely full of crap
