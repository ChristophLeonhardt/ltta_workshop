if you thought that the disappearance of a Saudi journalists in Turkey would hurt ties between Riyadh and Washington wrong military and diplomatic ties are closer than ever and Donald Trump recently spoke up about why that is I don't like the concept of stopping an investment of a hundred and ten billion dollars into the United States because you know what they're gonna do they're gonna take that money and spend it in Russia or China or someplace else the media was pretty shaken by his honesty if the Saudis are responsible and this is the bully that everyone elected to push around world leaders said it would not be a good thing at all look at the messages he said we don't mind dictatorship we have no interest in human rights in your country Saudi has been a client of the United States close relationship for a long time did the administration in Saudi Arabia figure that they were so comfortable in their relationship with Donald Trump that they could get a green light Trump seems to be admitting that US policy in the Middle East is not really about some moral impulse to spread freedom or humanitarian concerns he seems to be admitting that it's about money and selling military hardware the human rights record of Saudi Arabia has remained the same for decades but that's never stopped us presidents from swooning over the Saudi royal family Trump has a way of launching into truth tantrums unloading unspoken realities about international relations for example this is his take on the US invasion of Iraq bold expression to the victor belong the spoils you remember he always used to say keep the oil if we kept the yo you probably wouldn't have Isis cuz that's where they made their money in the first place so we should have kept the oil but ok Trump recently acknowledged that South Korea is not completely sovereign in its actions like when South Korea mulled over the possibility of easing relations with the north well they won't do it without our approval they do nothing without our approval so to be clear Donald Trump is not changing u.s. foreign policy he loves the Saudis he loves bossing South Korea around and he is not talking about cutting the huge military budget however he's getting rid of a lot of the smoke and mirrors and telling things as they actually are Kaleb Maupin RT New York you
