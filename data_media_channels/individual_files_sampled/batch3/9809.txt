EARLIER THIS EVENING I SPOKE TO DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ERIC SWALWELL WHO SITS ON THE HOUSE UNTIL COMMITTEE AND I GOT HIS TAKE. YOU KNOW, GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW NOW FROM THE IG REPORT WHICH CAUSED DIRECTOR COMEY INSUBORDINATE, IT SAYS THAT WE FOUND IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY AND A SUBORDINATE FOR COMEY TO CONCEAL HIS INTENTIONS FROM HIS SUPERIORS. IT GOES ON TO SAY HE USURPED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND IT DID NOT ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE LEGAL POSITION OF THE DEPARTMENT PROSECUTORS WHICH IS PRETTY STRONG LANGUAGE. SO GIVEN ALL THIS, DO YOU THINK NOW, LOOKING BACK, BUT THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT TO FIRE JAMES COMEY? NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT. AND THIS PRESIDENT JUST WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION WANTED TO THROW A PARADE FOR JAMES COMEY. HE AGREED WITH JAMES COMEY REOPENING THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION SO HE HAS NO CREDIBILITY ON THIS. THIS REPORT FOUND THERE WERE NO CRIMES BY CLINTON, NO BIASED BY THE FBI AND SOMETHING THAT WE ALL KNOW, JAMES COMEY IS AN IMPERFECT MAN JUST LIKE WE ARE ALL IMPERFECT PEOPLE AND HE COULD HAVE DONE HIS JOB BETTER. Martha: BUT WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT THIS, AND YOU LOOK AT THE MEMO, AND I KNOW THAT IT BECAME COMPLICATED. BUT THE MEMO THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN WROTE SAID THAT THIS INVESTIGATION WAS MISHANDLED AND THAT WAS THE REASON THAT JAMES COMEY NEEDED TO BE FIRED. SO LOOKING BACK, THIS NOW DOUBLES DOWN ON JAMES COMEY'S ACTIONS. AND THERE WOULD BE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT NEEDED TO BE FIRED. DO YOU THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS LYING FOR LESTER HOLTZ? HE TOLD LESTER HOLDS THAT HE FIRED HIM BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATION. MAYBE THAT IS THE CASE, BUT I THINK HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH TO LESSER HOLDS. Martha: HE HAS CITED A NUMBER OF REASONS AND WE ARE ALL VERY AWARE OF THAT SOUND BITE. I AGREE WITH YOU THAT HE ABSOLUTELY SAID THAT. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ROD ROSENSTEIN MEMO AND ALL THE REASONS HE OUTLINED, AND WITH REGARD TO THE FACT THAT THE FIVE FBI AGENTS HAVE NOW BEEN REFERRED TO FOR INVESTIGATION FOR BIAS AS A RESULT OF THIS, YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT? I HATE READING THE STROKE AND PAGE EXCHANGE, THAT IS NOT HOW FBI AGENTS SHOULD CONDUCT THEMSELVES AND I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE REFERRED FOR AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, AS IT RELATES TO THEIR JOBS. BUT THERE WAS A FINDING THAT IT DID NOT AFFECT ANY INVESTIGATION ACTIONS THAT THEY TOOK, NOR SHOULD IT. I HAVE BROTHERS WHO ARE POLICE OFFICERS AND THEY HAVE STRONG POLITICAL OPINIONS. I HOPE THAT IT NEVER AFFECTS WHAT THEY DO ON THE STREETS, AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY CASE WAS AFFECTED. Martha: GOING BACK TO WHAT I MENTIONED BEFORE, JAMES COMEY USURPED THE AUTHORITY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND DID NOT ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THEIR LEGAL POSITION OF THE DEPARTMENT PROSECUTORS. WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS CHANGED, AND IT'S BELIEVED THAT IT WAS LIKELY CHANGED BY PETER STRZOK. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS THAT WERE ALTERED, CHANGING REASONABLY LIKELY, THE HOSTILE ACTORS GAINED ACCESS TO THE EMAIL SERVER, THAT WAS CHANGED TO POSSIBLE. THEY ALSO CHANGE THAT SHE USE PRIVATE EMAIL TO COMMUNICATE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HOSTILE TERRITORY TO, A SENIOR OFFICIAL. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SOFTENING OF THAT LANGUAGE AS IT GOES THROUGH, AND YOU LOOK AT THE TEXT MESSAGE THAT SAYS, WE WILL FIND A WAY TO STOP IT WHEN IT COMES TO THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY, IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. BUT MARTHA, IF THEY WERE OUT TO HURT DONALD TRUMP, WHY WAS THERE NEVER A LEAK ABOUT THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION WITH A SERIOUS TALK CONTACT THAT HIS TEAM HAD? IF THEY WANTED TO DESTROY DONALD TRUMP, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE REOPENED THAT. Martha: IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WANTED TO KEEP THAT UNDER WRAPS. ONE MORE THING, THIS IS A STATEMENT FROM PETER STRZOK THROUGH HIS ATTORNEY, AND IT ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION, AND I KNOW DEMOCRATS CRITICIZED THE FACT THAT HERS WAS SO PUBLIC, AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WAS UNDER WRAPS. THERE'S SIMPLY NO EQUIVALENT FROM AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE POSSIBLE MISHANDLING OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. INCREDIBLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF A MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATE WAS ACTIVELY COLLUDING WITH A HOSTILE FOREIGN POWER IN A WAY THAT COULD UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, HE'S FIGHTING THAT OFF AS IT'S FACT. AND HE HAD TO MOVE HIS ATTENTION SO FOR FIRMLY OVER TO THIS CAMPAIGN, HE SO CLEARLY WANTED TO SUCCEED. THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT WHAT PETER STRZOK WAS SAYING, BUT THERE IS NOT A CONCLUSION. EVIDENCE HAS TO BE WEIGHED AND TESTED AND THAT WILL BEAR OUT THROUGH ANY FUTURE CHARGES THAT ARE IN ADDITION TO THE 20 PEOPLE THAT WERE ALREADY CHARGED AND THE GUILTY PLEA THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE INVESTIGATION.
