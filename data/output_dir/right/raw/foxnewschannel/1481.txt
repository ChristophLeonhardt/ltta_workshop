1
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:11,047
STEVE: IT HAS BEEN ONE OF

2
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:11,881
THE DEMOCRATS' RALLYING

3
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:12,982
CRIES SINCE DAY ONE.

4
00:00:12,982 --> 00:00:14,450
IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,585
NOW ONE HARVARD LAW

6
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:16,719
PROFESSOR TAKING IT TO A

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,421
WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL.

8
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:21,724
>> YOU CAN'T BE THE BOY WHO

9
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:22,992
CRIED WOLF AND EXPECT TO

10
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:26,062
HAVE A VIABLE IMPEACHMENT

11
00:00:26,062 --> 00:00:26,362
POWER.

12
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:27,463
YOU CAN'T USE IT OVER AND

13
00:00:27,463 --> 00:00:28,264
OVER AGAIN.

14
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:29,365
AGAINST THE SAME PRESIDENT.

15
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:30,266
>> RIGHT.

16
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:32,435
>> IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOOT

17
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:33,102
HIM, HAVE YOU GOT TO SHOOT

18
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:34,837
THE TAIL.

19
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:36,139
STEVE: WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE?

20
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:37,340
HERE TO WEIGH IN COLUMNIST

21
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,175
FOR THE HILL JOE CONCHA.

22
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:39,842
JOE, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

23
00:00:39,842 --> 00:00:42,111
>> HOW ARE YOU?

24
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:42,845
STEVE: DOING BETTER THAN HE

25
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:45,515
IS HE WAS OUT PROMOTING NEW

26
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:46,549
IMPEACHMENT BOOK AND HE

27
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:47,350
REALLY STEPPED IN IT?

28
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,217
>> IT APPEARS SO.

29
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:49,652
WHAT HE HAS STEPPED IN IS

30
00:00:49,652 --> 00:00:53,389
BASICALLY NOT A LOT OF

31
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:54,891
CONTROVERSY IN TERMS OF

32
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:56,058
PRESIDENT PRESS HOLDING HIM

33
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:57,360
TO ACCOUNT FOR MAKING THAT

34
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,693
REMARK.

35
00:00:57,693 --> 00:00:58,461
THERE IS AFFLICTION, STEVE

36
00:00:58,461 --> 00:00:59,896
IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IS

37
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:00,863
SWEEPING THE ENTIRE NATION

38
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:04,266
AND THAT THE INFLICTION OF

39
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:04,834
SELECTIVE OUTRAGE.

40
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:07,003
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS I GO

41
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:08,671
BAG TO AUGUST OF 2016.

42
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:09,338
CANDIDATE TRUMP.

43
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:10,706
HE BRINGS UP THE RIGHT TO

44
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:11,474
BEAR APARTMENTS.

45
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:12,341
HILLARY CLINTON IS ELECTED

46
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:13,743
THE JUDGES SHE APPOINTS TO

47
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:16,245
THE SUPREME COURT CAN TAKE

48
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:17,113
THAT SECOND AMENDMENT AWAY

49
00:01:17,113 --> 00:01:18,514
OR AT LEAST CHANGE IT AND HE

50
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:19,382
SAYS AND I QUOTE.

51
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:20,983
IF SHE GETS TO PICK HER

52
00:01:20,983 --> 00:01:22,351
JUDGES, NOTHING TO DO.

53
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:23,452
SECOND AMENDMENT PEOPLE

54
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:24,820
MAYBE THERE IS.

55
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,422
HE LATER SAYS PRO-SECOND

56
00:01:26,422 --> 00:01:27,056
AMENDMENT CITIZENS MUST

57
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:28,491
ORGANIZE AND GET OUT TO VOTE

58
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:29,592
TO SAVE OUR CONSTITUTION.

59
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:30,426
HERE ARE THE HEADLINES THAT

60
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:32,128
WERE A RESULT OF TRUMP JUST

61
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:32,995
SAYING THAT.

62
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:33,563
STEVE: THAT WAS BIG.

63
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:35,998
>> MY GOSH.

64
00:01:35,998 --> 00:01:37,066
HUFFINGTON POST DONALD TRUMP

65
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:37,733
SUGGESTS SHOOTING HILLARY

66
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:38,568
CLINTON, HER SUPREME COURT

67
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:40,903
PICKS OR BOTH.

68
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:42,271
SECOND AMENDMENT COMMENT CAN

69
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,206
NONT EXCUSED.

70
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:44,340
THE POINT IS IF A REPUBLICAN

71
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,308
OR A CONSERVATIVE SAYS

72
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:46,842
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

73
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:48,644
THE CONDEMNATION IS

74
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:49,979
OVERWHELMING, IF IT HAPPENS

75
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,615
WITH SOMEBODY LIKE LAWRENCE

76
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:55,785
TRIBE WHO IS A HARVARD LAW

77
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:56,219
PROFESSOR.

OUTRAGE.

81
00:01:58,387 --> 00:02:00,022
>> SWEEPING THE COUNTRY LIKE

82
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:03,492
THE MACARENA 1996.

83
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:03,926
MACARENA.

84
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:05,261
STEVE: HE DID TO HIS CREDIT

85
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:05,628
APOLOGIZE.

86
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:07,263
HE WROTE THIS ON TWITTER

87
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:08,197
OTHERWISE GOOD INTERVIEW I

88
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:09,999
MADE A TERRIBLE WORD CHOICE

89
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:10,900
SAYING IMPEACHMENT BULLET

90
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,468
CAN ONLY BE SHOT ONCE.

91
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:14,403
SO, ONE MUST SHOOT TO KILL.

92
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:16,505
I WASN'T SPEAKING LITERALLY

93
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:18,574
BUT HARD TO REDUCE GUN

94
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:18,941
VIOLENCE.

95
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:21,911
THIS WAS INEXCUSABLE VERY

96
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:22,211
SORRY.

97
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,479
>> VERY TRUMPIAN AND

98
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,313
OTHERWISE GOOD INTERVIEW.

99
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:25,448
YOU COULD LEAVE THAT PART

100
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:33,723
OUT WHEN DOING THE APOLOGY.

101
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:35,157
STEVE: I REMEMBER THE TIME

102
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:37,927
SARAH PALIN GOT IN TROUBLE

103
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:38,928
SELECTIVE OUTRAGE GRAPHIC

104
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:41,530
CAMPAIGN THINGS BEFORE

105
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,331
GABRIEL GIFFORDS WAS SHOT

106
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:43,299
DOWN IN ARIZONA.

107
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:45,334
NONETHELESS, THE OUTRAGE WAS

108
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:45,668
INTENSE.

109
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:47,703
>> TO THE POINT WHERE WHEN

110
00:02:47,703 --> 00:02:48,738
GABRIEL GIFFORDS AND THE

111
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:49,605
HORRIBLE SHOOTING THAT

112
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:50,940
HAPPENED IN ARIZONA, SARAH

113
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,974
PALIN WAS BLAMED DIRECTLY

114
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:53,209
BECAUSE SHE HAD CAMPAIGN

115
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,944
FLIERS OUT SAYING THAT THESE

116
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:58,047
DISTRICTS ARE IN THE

117
00:02:58,047 --> 00:02:58,514
CROSSHAIRS.

118
00:02:58,514 --> 00:02:59,282
STEVE: TO YOUR POINT THE

119
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:00,149
OUTRAGE WAS THERE BECAUSE

120
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:01,117
SHE WAS A CONSERVATIVE.

121
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:02,318
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

122
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:03,819
LOOK, WE SEE KATHY GRIFFIN.

123
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,187
REMEMBER, SHE HELD UP A

124
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:07,156
LIKENESS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.

125
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:07,590
STEVE: RIGHT.

126
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,159
THIS WAS EXACTLY A YEAR AGO.

127
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,794
SHE IS ON THE VIEW JUST TWO

128
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:13,195
WEEKS AGO GETTING A STOPPING

129
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:14,163
OVATION WHILE MOST OF THE

130
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:15,498
HOSTS ON THAT SHOW WERE

131
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:16,832
APPLAUDING HER FOR WHAT SHE

132
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:17,300
DID.

133
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,200
REMEMBER SHAKESPEARE IN THE

134
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,102
PARK JUST LAST SUMMER?

135
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:21,137
GRAPHICALLY MURDERING THE

136
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,271
PRESIDENT BASICALLY ON

137
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:22,638
STAGE?

138
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:23,539
STANDING OVATIONS EVERY

139
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:25,308
NIGHT AND THE PRESS

140
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:25,741
DEFINITED IT.

141
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:27,510
THE POINT IS THIS IS THE NEW

142
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,477
NORMAL IT NEVER WOULD HAVE

143
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:30,046
BEEN IN A BILLION YEARS A

00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:31,180
NEW NORMAL UNDER THE

145
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,981
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IF

146
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:34,216
THIS WERE PRESIDENT OBAMA.

147
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:35,151
STEVE: EXIT QUESTION, IS IT

148
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:36,152
PART OF THE PROBLEM THE FACT

149
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:37,920
THAT SO MANY MEMBERS OF THE

150
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,555
MAINSTREAM MEDIA ARE

151
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:39,922
DEMOCRATS?

152
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:40,690
OR LEAN THAT WAY?

153
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,258
>> OH, WELL, THEY DEFINITELY

154
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:43,726
LEAN THAT WAY AND JUST TO

155
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:45,394
WRAP UP HERE, 91% OF ALL

156
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:46,862
COVERAGE OF THIS PRESIDENT

157
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:48,364
HAS BEEN NEGATIVE SINCE HE

158
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:49,198
HAS TAKEN OFFICE.

159
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:51,834
THAT'S PEW, THAT'S MEDIA

160
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:53,636
WITH THIS SORT OF RHETORIC

161
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:54,970
BECAUSE OF HOT TARGET, NO

162
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,039
PUN INTENDED IS.

163
00:03:57,039 --> 00:00:00,000
STEVE: JOE CONCHA EXPLAINING
