1
00:00:10,249 --> 00:00:10,950
AINSLEY: SHE ONCE BLASTED THE

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,184
PRESIDENT AS WHITE SUPREMACIST

3
00:00:12,184 --> 00:00:15,154
BUT THE CONTROVERSIAL ESPN HOSTS

4
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:18,824
DESERVE A BIG AWARD.

5
00:00:18,824 --> 00:00:20,960
STEVE NATIONAL BLACK JOURNALIST

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,330
AWARDED JAMILLE HILL WITH

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,865
JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR AWARD.

BRIAN: LAWRENCE JONES, SHE'S

9
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:32,137
COMMENTARY WHETHER YOU AGREE

10
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:34,740
WITH HER OR NOT, THAT'S A

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,178
BRAND-NEW NUANCE TO THE

12
00:00:39,178 --> 00:00:39,612
CATEGORY.

13
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:40,813
>> THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

14
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:41,814
SHOULD BE PROMOTING.

15
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:43,949
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I WANT

16
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:45,551
PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME, PEOPLE

17
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:47,119
THAT LOOKED UP TO HER TO HAVE

18
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,121
SOMEONE ON TV THAT WILL FIT

19
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:50,322
FOREVER, SHOW THEM THAT THEY CAN

20
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:50,723
DO IT.

21
00:00:50,723 --> 00:00:52,024
NOW SHE CAN'T DO IT.

22
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:53,626
NOW SHE'S UNEMPLOYED.

23
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:55,027
THAT'S WHAT THE BLACK

24
00:00:55,027 --> 00:00:57,062
ASSOCIATION OF JOURNALISM, WE

25
00:00:57,062 --> 00:00:58,597
WILL APPLAUD UNEMPLOYMENT AND

26
00:00:58,597 --> 00:01:01,467
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I STAND

27
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:02,568
FOR.

28
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:04,236
STEVE: WHEN I WAS IN JOURNALISM

29
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:05,905
SCHOOL IT WAS ABOUT FACTS BUT

30
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:07,873
NOW APPARENTLY JOURNALISM LOOKS

31
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:10,075
A LOT LIKE ACTIVISM.

32
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:11,010
SOMETIMES YOU WATCH THE BRIEFING

33
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,678
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, A LOT OF

34
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:14,880
ACTIVISTS IN THERE.

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,048
>> ACTIVISM IS STARTING TO PAY

36
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:17,116
MORE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTINUE

37
00:01:17,116 --> 00:01:18,450
TO KEEP THEIR JOB.

38
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,852
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU CAN

39
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:21,086
HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT DONALD

40
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:22,922
TRUMP, A LOT OF TIMES I AGREE

41
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:24,290
WITH POLICIES, AT THE END OF THE

42
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,991
DAY, YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR

43
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:27,826
AUDIENCE, YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHO

44
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:28,594
YOU REPRESENT.

45
00:01:28,594 --> 00:01:29,962
HALF OF THE COUNTRY IS ON THE

46
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:31,330
RIGHT, HALF IS ON THE LEFT AND I

47
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,533
THINK SHE MADE A BAD BUSINESS

48
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:35,100
MOVE.

49
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,435
AINSLEY: WHEN THEY PULLED HER

50
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:39,872
OFF THE SHOW, THE RATINGS WENT

51
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:40,206
UP.

52
00:01:40,206 --> 00:01:41,740
>> OF COURSE, BECAUSE YOU ARE

53
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,009
BASHING PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR

54
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,244
THE PRESIDENT, I JUST DON'T

55
00:01:45,244 --> 00:01:47,112
THINK IT'S A SMART MOVE WHEN YOU

56
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:48,914
GET INTO THIS BUSINESS OF

57
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:49,381
ENTERTAINMENT.

58
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:51,250
YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO

59
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,151
DISAPPOINT SOMEONE WHEN YOU

60
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:55,054
START TALKING ABOUT POLITICIAN.

61
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:56,889
AINSLEY: SHE USES PLATFORM TO

62
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:58,524
ADDRESS NATIONAL, SOCIAL AND

63
00:01:58,524 --> 00:02:00,526
CULTURAL ISSUES IN ADDITION TO

64
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:01,327
SPORTS, NEARLY BROKE THE

65
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,295
INTERNET LAST YEAR WHEN SHE

66
00:02:03,295 --> 00:02:03,963
CRITICIZED PRESIDENT DONALD

67
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:04,330
TRUMP.

68
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,564
>> THE PLATFORM THAT SHE NO

69
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:07,600
LONGER HAS?

70
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,735
BRIEN: IF SHE DOES THE RIGHT

71
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,670
THING, BIG STORY AND SHE LOSES

72
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,473
HER JOB, A LOT OF TIMES YOUR

73
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:16,141
EDITORS DON'T APPRECIATE YOUR

74
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:17,977
WORK, IF YOU DO A GOOD JOB, MY

75
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:22,147
QUESTION IS, HER COMMENTARY MADE

76
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:25,184
THE NETWORK LOOK BAD, IS THAT

77
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:27,820
YOUR CONTENTION?

78
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,154
>> AT TEND OF THE DAY SHE WASN'T

79
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:30,823
REPRESENTING HER AUDIENCE.

80
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:32,191
AT TEND, WE ARE HERE TO PAY

81
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:36,328
BILLS, THIS IS CAPITALIST,

82
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:38,063
FREE-MARKET INDUSTRY WHERE YOUR

83
00:02:38,063 --> 00:02:39,898
JOB IS DETERMINED BY HER

84
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:41,567
RATINGS, IF HER RATINGS WERE

85
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:42,801
HIGHED SHE WOULD BE ON AIR NO

86
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:44,169
MATTER WHAT.

87
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:45,404
YOU'RE THERE TO SERVE AUDIENCE,

88
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:47,539
GIVE THEM THE CONTENT THAT THEY

89
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,975
NEED AND SHE WOULD HAVE KEPT

90
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:50,409
JOB.

91
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,478
RATINGS WENT UP AFTER EVER SINCE

92
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:53,812
SHE LEFT.

93
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:54,546
STEVE: THIS ORGANIZATION HAS

94
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:55,914
BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME

95
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:57,116
AND THAT'S THE WOMAN THAT THEY

96
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:59,485
WE WANTED TO GIVE THE AWARD TO

97
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,520
AND THEY'RE FREE TO DO THAT.

98
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,289
>> THEY ARE FREE TO GIVE AWARDS,

99
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:04,690
BUT STANDARD AS BLACK JOURNALIST

100
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,191
THAT YOU WANT TO SET FOR THE

101
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:08,027
NEXT GENERATION, I THOUGHT WE

102
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:09,561
BELIEVED IN BLACK BUSINESS

103
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:12,765
OWNERS, HOW CAN SHE DONATE TO

104
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:14,633
THOSE BLACK FOLKS IF SHE DOESN'T

105
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:15,668
HAVE A PLATFORM.

106
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:17,503
IF I HAD A LITTLE GIRL, IF SHE

107
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:19,538
WANTED TO GO TO SPORTS, SHE CAN

108
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:22,708
LOOK UP TO JAMELE, WELL, THERE'S

109
00:03:22,708 --> 00:00:00,000
NO JAMELE ANYMORE.
