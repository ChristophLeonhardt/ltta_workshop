So Shakespeare knew better than 
anyone that for two hundred 
years they talked about 
hearing plays, 
you went to listen to a play.
And Shakespeareâ€™s words have 
endured over the course of time,
and he performed, 
you know, open air,
and that is the tradition to 
listen to these plays 
with the baseline of sound 
being these woods 
or this natural setting.
And there is nothing quite like
the end of a play,
to have the story be done,
it go to blackout,
and the entire thousand seats 
look up to the sky, 
and take a breath.
