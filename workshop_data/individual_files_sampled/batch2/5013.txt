that's what these families are hoping that the Border Patrol comes out here to find them and then brings them back into detention what's obviously happening now with the zero tolerance policy those families are getting separated and it's creating this crisis down on the border again the Border Patrol says as of right now in areas like this it has not deterred people from crossing and we're back that was my colleague Jacob Soboroff along the us-mexico border earlier today and while homeland security secretary Kirsten nielsen denied yesterday that the Trump administration separation policy was meant to deter undocumented immigrants from crossing the border Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House chief of staff John Kelly both have actually said that this is a policy that was intended to be used as a deterrent and the Department of Homeland Security tells Jacob Soboroff it could be weeks until they see evidence the family separation policy is deterring anyone from leaving Central America meanwhile in McAllen Texas over a thousand children have already been taken away from their parents at processing centers and that is where Jacob Soboroff is right now and Jacob I know you feel like you're spending more time in front of a camera the last few hours and I apologize for that but frankly you you're our eyewitness account you're the guy that's been first-hand account first of all tell me what you've seen today well I want to talk to you about what I've heard in what I've seen because what we you know what I've seen is inside this facility right I've been inside this facility is the Border Patrol processing station central to all of this more than 1,100 kids have been separated just in this sector coming out of this building alone more than anywhere else Chuck you know along the entire southern border I saw that I saw the mylar blankets I saw the mattresses on the floor I saw the cages inside there's no doubt about it that's exactly what's going on inside that building what I heard today was Kristin Nielsen the echoes of what she was saying yesterday that she's been inside Border Patrol detention facilities before but today from our colleagues in Washington we found out that she's never been inside here never once never set foot inside she's been in a detention facility in Arizona after this policy was announced and one in no-time ASA in California before it was announced but the Secretary of Homeland Security was talking about the policy that's separating kids from their parents at a rate that's never ever been done before has I've been in the facility at the center of it all and I find it was shocking I'm with you one who's the highest government official that has from the Trump administration maybe that's maybe the sector chief of the Border Patrol Manuel Padilla who's down here and he's not the chief of the entire Border Patrol I wonder if the representative the gentleman from the Border Patrol the Commissioner that you had on the broadcast last week decided here and and seen what's going on in here you know if it's just this disconnect between what's going on in Washington DC and what is playing out on the ground right now and and guess what they're they're still coming they're coming across the border today and rates they've been coming across the border before this policy was enacted and like you said they claim it's gonna take weeks to figure that out but how do we know that for sure I was just gonna say word's gotten around that I assume this isn't going to take weeks to get word out there so Minoo I think there's some sort of Fantasyland here that they think people that have decided to track hundreds and of miles risking their life is somehow oh no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna go all the way I mean do they not understand why these folks leave they're some of the most desperate people I've ever met in my entire life Chuck they're fleeing violence and persecution they're literally running for their lives in most of these cases they feel like they have no other option but to come here why else well would you go sit on a bridge at the port of entry for weeks at a time and try to get into the United States I sat down with the chief of the sector Manuel Padilla earlier today and I asked him you know they've been floating these lines which frankly are just ridiculous about there's fraud in the system and families are coming fraudulently they're pretending like their families together so how many families how did the percentage of people you've apprehended here are fraudulent the answer is 1% he said that's the statistical answer for what they have so out of hundreds of that tens of thousands one percent of them are phony families that try to make their way now it's just phony math and the fraud correct me if I'm wrong the fraud is actually fraud that many of these immigrants have committed against them right they're paying people in order to get through the trek safely and those are the scam artists and those are bad people and those but not their scamming the immigrants aren't they we're talking about coyotes you're talking about coyote a South yet the border that are controlled and paid taxes and duties to the smuggling organizations like the Sinaloa cartel and they are they're taken advantage of the people coming across the southern border and these cartel organizations have gotten so strong because of the drug wars down there but these these people are victims of the crimes not because they're stupid but because they're desperate they're trying to get into this country any way they can in those cartels are controlling all that territory down there and if the government want to actually focus on solving a problem they figure out how to eradicate the cartels go down there and do some diplomacy figure out how to do some economic development so these people are coming here to basically save their own lives to change their lives forever that's what they're hoping to do here in the United States and instead we're putting them in this building and now taking their kids away from them at rates that we've never seen ever historically before would they let you back in right now if they if you if you just walked in right now when they kick you out no and and you know who else isn't letting us in the Department of Health and Human Services we've asked them where the meeting they're not letting you in right now you would be kicked out if you tried to go in yeah they say there's gonna be another media tour you know on Friday of this facility but by the way that's another media tour of the same place we've already been and what about the other detention centers across the southwest border there are many of those two and then HHS has all the kids that come out of here over 11,000 right now haven't seen the girls haven't seen the children they offer to give us pictures from 2016 before this policy was enacted I said no thank you we'll
