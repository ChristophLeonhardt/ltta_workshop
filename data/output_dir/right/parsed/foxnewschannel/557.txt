FUTURE JUSTICE.
>> Harris: GOING TO HAVE TO
CUT IN WITH BREAKING NEWS.
WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT AT THE
U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY TODAY IS
MET WITH THE PRESIDENT OF
COLUMBIA AND WAS ASKED SOME
QUESTIONS ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
LET'S WATCH TOGETHER.
>> President Trump: TRY TO
MAKE THEM INTO SOMETHING, LET'S
BE NICE ABOUT IT, THAT HE'S NOT.
HE HAS A HIGH-QUALITY PERSON, A
GREAT INTELLECT, YOU'RE ALSO NOT
SEEING HIM ON HIS FOOTING.
THIS ISN'T HIS FOOTING.
HE HAS NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE.
HE'S NEVER HAD ANY CHARGES LIKE
THIS.
CHARGES COME UP FROM 36 YEARS
AGO THAT ARE TOTALLY
UNSUBSTANTIATED?
YOU WATCHING THIS IS THE
PRESIDENT OF A GREAT COUNTRY,
YOU MUST THINK HOW IS THIS
POSSIBLE?
76 YEARS AGO, NOBODY EVER KNEW
ABOUT IT OR HEARD ABOUT IT AND
NOW A NEW CHARGE COMES UP AND
SHE SAID IT MIGHT NOT BE HIM AND
THERE WERE GAPS AND SAID SHE WAS
TOTALLY INEBRIATED, ALL MESSED
UP.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW IF IT WAS HIM,
BUT IT MIGHT'VE BEEN HIM.
DOES NOT MAKE HIM A
SUPREME COURT JUDGE BECAUSE OF
THAT.
THIS IS A CON GAME BEING PLAYED
BY THE DEMOCRATS ALSO.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE LAWYERS.
THESE LAWYERS ARE THE SAME
LAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN FIGHTING
FOR YEARS.
THEY KEEP FIGHTING.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE LAWYERS.
AND IT'S A SHAME THAT YOU CAN DO
THIS TO A PERSON'S LIFE.
I'LL TELL YOU, MAYBE EVEN MORE
IMPORTANT, WHO IS GOING TO WANT
TO GO BEFORE THE SYSTEM TO BE A
SUPREME COURT JUDGE WERE TO BE A
JUDGE WERE TO BE EVEN A
POLITICIAN?
I CAN TELL YOU THAT FALSE
ACCUSATION AND FALSE ACCUSATIONS
OF ALL TYPES ARE MADE AGAINST A
LOT OF PEOPLE.
THIS IS A HIGH-QUALITY PERSON
AND I CERTAINLY HOPE -- IT WOULD
BE A HORRIBLE INSULT TO OUR
COUNTRY.
IT WILL BE A HORRIBLE THING FOR
FUTURE POLITICAL PEOPLE AND
JUDGES, ANYTHING YOU WANT, IT
WOULD BE A HORRIBLE THING.
IT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING A CON
GAME.
THEY KNOW IT'S A CON GAME.
DID THEY KNOW HE'S HIGH-QUALITY.
AND THEY WEAKEN EACH OTHER.
THEY KNOW IT'S A CON GAME.
>> WITH A SECOND ACCUSER BE
ALLOWED TO TESTIFY ON THURSDAY,
WOULD YOU WELCOME THAT?
>> THE SECOND ACCUSER HAS
NOTHING.
THE SECOND ACCUSER THINKS MAYBE
HE COULD HAVE BEEN HIM, MAYBE
NOT.
SHE ADMITS SHE WAS DRUNK.
SHE ADMITS TIME LAPSES.
THIS IS A PERSON AND THIS IS A
SERIES OF STATEMENTS THAT'S
GOING TO TAKE ONE OF THE MOST
TALENTED GOVERNMENT OF THE
GREATEST INTELLECTS FROM A
JUDICIAL STANDPOINT IN OUR
COUNTRY GOING TO KEEP HIM OFF
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.
I SAID SOMETHING THIS MORNING,
HE HAS A CHANCE TO BE ONE OF THE
GREATEST JUSTICES EVER IN THE
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.
WHAT A SHAME, AND WHAT A SHAME
IT IS FOR SOME OF THE OTHER
PEOPLE WHOSE WORLD THAT DOESN'T.
THAT'S NOT HIS WORLD AND IS NOT
THEIR WORLD.
THESE ARE LEGITIMATE PEOPLE.
IF THEY'RE NOT IN THE WORLD OF
CONS IN THE WORLD OF OBSTRUCT IN
THE OF RESIST.
HE NEVER THOUGHT THIS WAS EVEN A
POSSIBILITY, HE CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.
HIS WIFE IS DEVASTATED.
HIS CHILDREN ARE DEVASTATED.
I DON'T MEAN LIKE I'M A LITTLE
UNHAPPY.
THEY ARE DEVASTATED.
AND IT'S BECAUSE THESE DEMOCRATS
AND THEY KNOW WHEN I SEE SCHUMER
WHO NEVER EVEN SAW THIS WOMAN, I
BELIEVE HER 100% OF THESE OTHER
SENATORS THAT I DEAL WITH ON A
DAILY BASIS, I KNOW THEM BETTER
THAN THEY KNOW THEMSELVES.
IT IS JUST A GAME TO THEM.
BUT IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS GAME
FOR OUR COUNTRY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Harris: THE PRESENT THEY'RE
GOING AS FAR TO DEFEND HIS
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE TO SAY
THAT THIS IS A CON GAME BY
DEMOCRATS.
AND HE EARLIER HAD SAID THAT HE
MIGHT BE ACCORDING TO THE
WHITE HOUSE OPEN TO HEARING A
SECOND ACCUSER AGAINST JUDGE
KAVANAUGH BUT YOU HEARD HIM
SAYING RIGHT THERE THAT THE
WOMAN, THE SECOND ACCUSER WAS
INEBRIATED ACCORDING TO HER,
DOESN'T REMEMBER SOME OF THE
PERTINENT DETAILS IN HER
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
HE SAYS THIS IS NOT HIS PERSONAL
FOOTING.
HE HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE
SITUATION BEFORE.
THE PRESIDENT THERE AND YOU
MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE
THE WAY IT WAS FRAMED, BUT HE
WAS STANDING NEXT TO THE
PRESIDENT'S OF COLUMBIA BECAUSE
THEY WERE HAVING A MEETING OF
THESE QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS
CAME UP.
WE GOT A NOTE QUICKLY IN
BREAKING NEWS FASHION, LET'S GET
TO THIS AND THAT WE SEE WHY.
RIGHT ON POINT AS WE CONTINUE
THE CONVERSATION HERE ON OUT
NUMBERED.
WE DO I'LL GO BACK TO YOU,
FINISH YOUR THOUGHT.
>> Lawrence: WENT TO PICK UP
AT THE PRESIDENT SAID, THIS IS A
CON JOB BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN DEMOCRATS
CAN'T GO THROUGH THE LEGAL
PROCESS, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.
THEY DECIDE THAT THEY WANT THE
COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION BECAUSE
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE.
WE SAW IT IN THE UNIVERSITY OF
VIRGINIA CASE WHERE THE
ROLLING STONES WROTE THIS BIG
ARTICLE ABOUT THIS AND ENDED UP
HAVING TO PAY THESE GUYS BECAUSE
THEY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH
EVIDENCE TO TAKE THIS TO COURT
OF LAW.
THE JUDGE KEEP SAYING THAT HE
WANTS FAIRNESS, HE'S NOT GOING
TO GET FAIRNESS.
THE ONLY WAY IS IN A COURT OF
LAW.
SPEAKING WITH THE PRESIDENT SAID
THERE, WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE
YOU COULD SEE ONLY BE WOMEN WHO
ARE NOMINATED FOR A POST AND
PROMOTED TO CEO AT THIS POINT
BECAUSE ANYBODY ELSE IT SEEMS
LIKE COULD BE VULNERABLE.
AT THE SAME TIME CAN YOU HEAR
FROM EXECUTIVES WHO SAY I DON'T
WANT TO HIRE WOMEN ANYMORE
BECAUSE IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FOR
ME.
THERE ARE SO MANY EXTERNALITIES
TO THIS.
>> Tomi: IT PUTS WOMEN AT A
BAD POSITION BECAUSE IT MEANS WE
ARE GETTING A POSITION NOT
BECAUSE OF OUR MERIT BUT BECAUSE
WE ARE THE SAFE OPTION OR IT
MEANS WE ARE NOT GETTING A
POSITION BECAUSE THE MALES THAT
WERE AROUND FEEL THAT IT'S TOO
DANGEROUS, THEY'RE AFRAID OF
LAWSUITS AND ALLEGATIONS.
PUTS WOMEN IN A DIFFICULT
POSITION AND FURTHERMORE, I LIVE
IN LOS ANGELES, THAT IS THE
BIRTHPLACE OF THIS WHOLE ME TOO
MOVEMENT, IT STARTED OUT IN WHAT
I BELIEVE IS A GREAT THING WHICH
WAS BRINGING WOMEN OUT THAT HAD
ACTUALLY BEEN ASSAULTED AND WERE
COMING OUT AND SAYING THIS
HAPPENED TO ME, WE'VE BEEN QUIET
FOR TOO LONG AND IT TURNED UGLY,
THEN IT TURNED TO THIS.
IT TURNED INTO I CAN MAKE SOME
POLITICALLY CONVENIENT
ALLEGATIONS, RUIN SOMEONE'S LIFE
IN SOMEONE'S FAMILY AND WE CAN
DO IT ALL IN THE NAME OF THE ME
TOO MOVEMENT BUT REALLY, IS
DEMOCRAT DRIVEN, IT'S HOLLYWOOD
DRIVEN AND I THINK THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE ARE REALLY SICK AND TIRED
OF IT.
>> Harris: I BET YOU WANT TO
RESPOND TO THAT.
>> Adrienne: HERE'S WHAT I
WANT TO SAY, IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH
TRULY BELIEVES HE'S INNOCENT AND
WE DON'T KNOW, WE'LL SEE WHAT
HAPPENS ON THURSDAY AND THIS IS
NOT GOING TO BE DECIDED IN FRONT
OF A JURY, IT'S GOING TO BE
DECIDED BY A PANEL OF SENATORS
AND WHO WILL LARGELY BE DRIVEN
BY THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.
EXACTLY, 36 YEARS AGO.
IF HE TRULY IS INNOCENT, WHY NOT
ALLOW FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION?
IF I WERE HIM, I WOULD SAY I
WANT MY NAME CLEARED, SO I WANT
THE FBI, I WANT THE LAW.
>> Harris: CAN I JUST HAVE
BEEN FOR A MINUTE?
WE HAVE NOW GOTTEN TO A PLACE
THAT WAS MRS. FORD AND NOW YOU
ARE SUGGESTING THAT JUDGE
KAVANAUGH DO IT, ARE WE IN A
PLACE WHERE AMERICAN CITIZENS
CAN JUST SAY FBI, GO DO THIS?
BECAUSE HE'S NOT SAYING HE
DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THIS BUT AS
THE SENATE'S PLACE, OTHERS
PEOPLES PLACE TO CALL FOR AN
INVESTIGATION.
IS THAT THE JUDGES AND QUITE
FRANKLY, IT'S NOT MRS. FORD'S
EITHER.
>> Adrienne: HE IS TRYING TO
SEEK CONFIRMATION TO THE HIGHEST
COURT IN THE LAND WITH A LOT OF
STEAK IT.
SO HE DOES -- IF I WERE HIM, I
WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER
TO SAY LET'S GET AN OUTSIDE
CONVENING ENTITY HERE TO TRY TO
DETERMINE.
>> Lawrence: ARE YOU GOING TO
CALL THE SAME THING FOR KEITH
ELLISON WHO IS THE VICE CHAIR OF
YOUR PARTY?
>> Adrienne: ABSOLUTELY.
I ACTUALLY THINK KEITH ELLISON
SHOULD STEP DOWN FROM THE DNC.
>> Lawrence: YOU ARE THE
FIRST.
>> Harris: IS THAT ENOUGH?
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING THAT HE
IS ACCUSED OF DOING, IS STEPPING
DOWN ENOUGH, GIVING UP A
PAYCHECK?
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE AN FBI
INVESTIGATION?
>> Adrienne: I PERSONALLY
CHOOSE TO ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT
WOMEN IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE.
>> Tomi: AS A WOMAN HAVE, HOW
CAN YOU SAY JUST THAT WE SHOULD
BE BELIEVED.
YOU DON'T THINK THEY ARE CAPABLE
OF LYING AND SCHEMING, HE WORKED
FOR HILLARY CLINTON SO I GUESS
YOU KNOW THAT.
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD JUST TAKE
WOMEN'S WORD AS GOSPEL?
THAT'S INFURIATING TO ME AS A
WOMAN BECAUSE I DON'T LOOK AT
OTHER WOMEN AND SAY I'M JUST
GOING TO BELIEVE YOU BECAUSE WE
HAVE THE SAME BIOLOGICAL MAKING.
I THINK THAT'S WRONG.
>> Adrienne: THAT'S THE
PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW,
A LOT OF WOMEN WHO ARE SCARED TO
COME FORWARD, I BELIEVE THAT
WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THIS
CASE 36 YEARS AGO AND DR. FORD
FINALLY HAS THE COURAGE TO COME
FORWARD AND A LOT OF OTHER WOMEN
ARE FINALLY HAVING THE COURAGE
TO COME FORWARD.
>> Melissa: ONE AT A TIME, LET
HER FINISH.
>> Adrienne: I THINK WHEN WE
HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS LIKE
THIS, WE ARE DISCOURAGING WOMEN
WHO TRULY HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT
FROM BEING ABLE TO COME FORWARD.
>> Harris: THE WHOLE PROCESS
IS DISCOURAGING FOR WOMEN.
>> Melissa: THERE WAS A
DISCOURAGEMENT TO COME FORWARD,
BUT NOW WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE
IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE FEEL
COMFORTABLE GOING FORWARD AND
DIDN'T WE KIND OF SEE THIS
COMING WHEN PEOPLE STARTED
SAYING YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THE
WOMEN NO MATTER WHAT?
A RED LIGHT WENT OFF AND A LOT
OF PEOPLE'S MINDS WHERE YOU SAID
WAIT A SECOND, IT DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE TO BELIEVE ANY GROUP OF
PEOPLE NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY.
BASED ON THE GROUP THAT THEY
ARE.
MAYBE LISTEN TO THEM AND YOU GO
LOOK INTO IT AND YOU SHOW THEM
RESPECT, BUT YOU DON'T
AUTOMATICALLY DECIDE -- I THINK
SHE HAS BEEN LISTEN TO AND SHE
HAS BEEN SHOWN RESPECT AND SHE'S
BEEN INVITED TO COME AND TELL
HER STORY.
I'M NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED WE'RE
GOING TO SEE HER ON THURSDAY
BECAUSE HER TEAM KEEPS CHANGING
THE DEMANDS.
AT FIRST, THEY SAID THAT THEY
WOULDN'T HAVE SENATORS INVOLVED
AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE WAS GOING
TO HAVE TO AT THOSE QUESTIONS
AND NOW THEY'RE OFFENDED BY
THAT.
THEY KEEP CHANGING THE RULES
AROUND IT.
I THINK EVERYBODY DESERVES TO BE
HEARD AND TO BE RESPECTED, BUT
YOU DON'T GET TO BE BELIEVED
AUTOMATICALLY.
>> Harris: I WANT TO GIVE YOU
THE LAST WORD JUST IN TERMS OF
WHAT WE COULD SEE LATER THIS
WEEK AND WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING
FOR.
>> Lawrence: I DON'T THINK
SHE'S GOING TO SHOW.
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VERY CRITICAL
OF THE PEOPLE ASKING QUESTIONS
BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY, THE STORY
HASN'T CHECKED OUT WITH THE
WITNESSES.
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY WEREN'T
THERE, PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE
MENTIONED AND I'M SORRY, I USED
TO BE A DEMOCRAT AND I REMEMBER
THE STORIES OF THE DEMOCRATS
WHEN THEY TOLD ME REMEMBER
EMMETT TILL.
BECAUSE PEOPLE DO LIE.
SO THIS IS NEW FOR THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY BECAUSE THIS IS
