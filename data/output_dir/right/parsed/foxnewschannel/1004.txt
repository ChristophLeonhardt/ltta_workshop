HOUR OF "FOX AND FRIENDS FIRST"
ON THE EAST COAST, HALF PAST THE
TOP OF THE HOUR BUT THAT IS A
LIVE SHOT FROM SINGAPORE WHERE A
HISTORIC MEETING HAS TAKEN
PLACE.
NO SITTING PRESIDENT HAS EVER
MET OR SPOKEN ON THE PHONE WITH
A NORTH KOREAN LEADER UNTIL NOW.
DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT ONLY MET

ROLE IN ACHIEVING WHAT WE JUST
SAW.

DELIVER CRIPPLING SANCTIONS THE
LEFT NORTH KOREA WITH LITTLE
CHOICE BUT TO NEGOTIATE.

UNANIMOUSLY BY THE SECURITY

RUSSIA TO AGREE TO NEW SANCTIONS
IN 2016, IT WAS AMBASSADOR HALEY
WHO REFUSED TO, QUOTE, ACCEPT
THE STRUCTURALIST POSITION OF
HER RECALCITRANT RUSSIAN AND
CHINESE COUNTERPARTS ACCORDING
TO HER FORMER SPOKESPERSON AND
MADE IT CLEAR THE US WAS
PREPARED TO END THE NORTH KOREAN
THREAT ON ITS OWN WHICH FORCED
AGING AND MOSCOW TO FINALLY ACT.
ACCORDING TO SENIOR WHITE HOUSE
OFFICIALS IN A STATEMENT OF FOX
NEWS AMBASSADOR HALEY'S
DIPLOMACY BEHIND-THE-SCENES, IN
PARTICULAR WITH THE CHINESE
AMBASSADOR MADE IT VERY CLEAR WE
WERE NOT KIDDING AROUND.
WE WERE LITERALLY JUST ONE MORE
PROVOCATION AWAY FROM SOME KIND
OF MILITARY ACTION THAT WOULD
BRING GREAT HARM TO THE ENTIRE
REGION AND THE THREAT WE
PERCEIVED WAS NO LONGER
THEORETICAL BY ANY MEANS.
THEREAFTER, MIKE POMPEO -- MIKE
