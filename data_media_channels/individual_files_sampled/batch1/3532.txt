the goal of the world around us is to tempt us think about it and Dunkin Donuts what is their objective in life to make you healthy in 30 years or to get you to get another doughnut right now so we have lots of problems with self-control self-control is now versus later and we have lots of wishes for the future but now we act very badly this is why we overeat and under save and text and drive and have unprotected sex we do all kinds of things that are fun in the moment and really costly long-term and the problem is we have a really hard time thinking about long-term it means we need to develop mechanisms to fight self-control and there's lots of ways to do it I'll just give you two ways to think about it one is take control over the environment that you have control of them which is your house why don't you at least start and regulate whatever you have tempting available for you at home no sodas and no boxed cookies and stuff like this at home even if you eat them outside of the home don't bring them in the house the moment you open your refrigerator and the soft drinks is kind of represented as the most salient thing the moment you open it you're going to be tempted right and so take advantage of the environment you control and try to eliminate temptation from there the other thing is to realize that if we have to make a decision every time there's a good chance we will fail every time think about savings 401ks are incredibly powerful why because we make one decision the money goes automatically from our checking account and we don't have to make a decision every time if at the end of each month you had to decide how much to save each month you would not save anything what kind of other rules we can create in life can you set yourself something like I don't eat dessert unless it's Friday night or I doubt it more than Exxon breakfast or I whatever it is the moment we have rules and things that play out for us in the long term and we don't have to make a decision every time we limit dramatically the opportunity to fail but it's doing something important and we need to work on it and it's not going to be easy because the world is trying to tempt us but we need to fight back
