00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:36,330
A PRESIDENT CAN'T PROPERLY

81
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,633
DEFEND HIMSELF WHEN HE HAS TIME

82
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:41,369

IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM IT

87
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:53,114
IS DAMAGING TO HIM, BECAUSE HE

88
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:55,550
CAN'T FOCUS ON HIS DEFENSE WHICH

89
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,952
IS DIFFERENT ON CIVIL LIT GAGDZ

90
00:03:57,952 --> 00:04:01,589

00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:04,625
SECURITY AND WELL-BEING.

92
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,626
THE PRESIDENT CAN'T FUNCTION

WITH THESE KINDS OF BURDEN.

94
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:10,331
