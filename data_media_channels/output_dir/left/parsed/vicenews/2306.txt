my attorneys believed and I believed
that I was a victim of a selective and
vindictive prosecution I think that the
Justice Department has been incredibly
hypocritical in leaked cases Washington
operates on leaks and the truth of the
matter has turned out to be if it's a
supporter of the president leaking or
the leak makes the government look good
you're good to go
if your leak is critical of the
government or the government wants to
punish you in some way
then they prosecute you
