00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,600
I'm just as excited as everyone else

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,490
about the new Star Wars movie but

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,080
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely a chance that it may</font>

not live up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the hype one reason this</font>

guy director JJ Abrams let me be<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear i</font>

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,630
am a JJ<font color="#E5E5E5"> Abrams fan I love his Star Trek</font>

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,699
movies I'm a huge fan of his screenplay

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,710
for regarding Henry while Abrams is a

master at<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating hype for his projects</font>

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,789
some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> have failed to pay off</font>

let's start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with lost and before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,260
trolls tear me a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand</font>

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,050
that JJ Abrams had quote nothing to do

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,239
with the way the show ended but he did

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,670
start it and the way it played out let a

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,440
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people down then there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,840
Cloverfield the found-footage monster

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,700
movie that had a brilliant trailer that

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,270
broke the internet but in the end the

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,370
payoff was a little underwhelming then

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,530
there was super<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8 Abrams Oh Maj too</font>

22
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,750
early Spielberg movies it had an

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,850
insanely great trailer that got me in

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> theater but in the end the big</font>

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,899
reveal disappointed big time and here we

26
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">are in 2015 and Abrams has us all hyped</font>

27
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,260
up again for star wars the force<font color="#E5E5E5"> awakens</font>

28
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,670
while we know very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little about the plot</font>

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,500
we do know that it will feature much of

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,110
the original cast which is exciting but

31
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,270
definitely concerning because think back

32
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,860
to just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and one of the</font>

resurrected starring a much older

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,299
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of its hero disaster it made a</font>

36
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,729
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money but at the cost of angering</font>

37
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,439
and insulting the majority of its

38
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,750
fanbase it's already<font color="#CCCCCC"> a guaranteed</font>

39
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,090
millions of people myself included are

gonna pay money to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this movie we'll</font>

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,780
just have to wait and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if Abrams</font>

42
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,270
pulls another big bait and switch I'm

43
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,490
just managing my expectations because

44
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,640
for all we know it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a trap but</font>

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,250
try out like a trap like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Admiral Ackbar</font>
