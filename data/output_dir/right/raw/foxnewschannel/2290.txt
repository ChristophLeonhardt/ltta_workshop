1
00:00:00,706 --> 00:00:03,009
BE REPLANTED VERY SOON.

2
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:04,610
SO NO DRAMA THERE.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,948
ROB: THAT'S WHAT I WAS WONDERING

4
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:11,017
MIKE POMP BOW WRAPPING UP TRIP

5
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:12,218
TO MIDDLE EAST AFTER SENDING

6
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:13,753
WARNING TO IRAN THAT THE U.S. IS

7
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:16,122
READY TO PULL OUT OF THE NUCLEAR

8
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:16,422
DEAL.

9
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:17,657
AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE OF

10
00:00:17,657 --> 00:00:20,193
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TEAM SENDING A

11
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:22,361
STERN MESSAGE TO NATIONS AROUND

12
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:23,396
THE WORLD.

13
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:26,332
>> IF, IN FACT, KIM HAS MADE A

14
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:30,303
STRATEGIC DECISION TO GIVE UP

15
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:32,070
PROGRAM, THEN I THINK DECIDING

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,639
ON THE PLACE AND DATE SHOULD BE

17
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:36,342
FAIRLY EASY.

18
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:37,944
>> WE REMAIN CONCERN OF CONCERNS

19
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:40,847
OF ESCALATION OF THREATS AND

20
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:42,982
IRAN AMBITIONS TO DOMINATE

21
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:44,150
MIDDLE EAST REMAINS.

22
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,885
ROB: IS THIS THE FOREIGN POLICY

23
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:47,353
THAT AMERICA NEEDS RIGHT NOW?

24
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:51,157
HERE TO DEBATE MEDIA RON MYER

25
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:53,526
AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGISTS

26
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:55,061
ANTOINE, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON

27
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:55,561
THIS MORNING.

28
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,062
>> GOOD MORNING.

29
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:57,463
ROB: RON, WE WILL START WITH

30
00:00:57,463 --> 00:01:00,766
YOU, AFTER 8 YEARS OF RELATIVE

31
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:01,567
SOFTNESS AS FAR AS FOREIGN

32
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,302
POLICY AND PREDICTILITY, I

33
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:04,769
THINK, THIS IS COMPLETELY

34
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,137
DIFFERENT.

35
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:05,872
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE PRESIDENT

36
00:01:05,872 --> 00:01:07,106
IS GOING TO DO AT ANY GIVEN TIME

37
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:09,108
AND HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE SHY

38
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:10,776
ABOUT STARTING A FIGHT, WHAT DO

39
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:13,412
YOU SAY?

40
00:01:13,412 --> 00:01:14,413
>> WELL, WHETHER YOU LOOK AT

41
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:15,681
TRADE OR DIFFERENT NEGOTIATIONS

42
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:17,216
LIKE TRYING TO REOPEN THE IRAN

43
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:18,584
DEAL, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE

44
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:19,819
ARE GOING TO BE IN A BETTER

45
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,087
POSITION AT THE END OF THE DAY,

46
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:22,788
THE IRAN DEAL OBVIOUSLY WASN'T

47
00:01:22,788 --> 00:01:24,390
THE BEST DEAL FOR THE UNITED

48
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,758
STATES AND I THINK EUROPE IS

49
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:27,159
GOING TO BE OPEN TO LOOKING AT

50
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,694
IT IN TRYING TO SEE IF IT COULD

51
00:01:28,694 --> 00:01:30,363
BE MADE STRONGER AND HOW IS THAT

52
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:32,198
NOT BETTER FOR THE UNITED

53
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:32,532
STATES?

54
00:01:32,532 --> 00:01:35,801
IF YOU LOOK AT TRADE, OBVIOUSLY

55
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:36,903
THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE ONLY GONE

56
00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:38,771
OUR WAY, YES, THERE WERE TARIFFS

57
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:41,974
AND COSTS IN THE SHORT TERM BUT

58
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:43,809
COUNTRIES LIKE SOUTH KOREA HAVE

59
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:45,645
CHANGED TRADE LAWS TO BE

60
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:46,479
FRIENDLIER TO THE UNITED STATES

61
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,683
AND WE HEAR ABOUT CHINA AND

62
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:51,551
THOSE NEGOTIATIONS.

63
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:53,286
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WITH

64
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:55,621
NORTH KOREA, THINGS ARE MORE

65
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:57,156
HOPEFUL THAN THEY HAVE EVER

66
00:01:57,156 --> 00:01:59,158
BEEN, WHEN YOU HAVE POMPEO AND

67
00:01:59,158 --> 00:02:06,766
BOLTON WHO ARE HAWKS, IT PUTS

68
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:08,935
YOU IN GREAT NEGOTIATING

69
00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:09,568
POSITION.

70
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,203
ROB: REPUBLICANS ARE QUICK TO

71
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:12,371
TAKE A LOT OF CREDIT AND THE

72
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:13,506
PRESIDENT TO TAKE A LOT OF

73
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:16,275
CREDIT WHERE WE ARE IN THE

74
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:17,009
NEGOTIATION, DEMOCRATS SAY WE

75
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,411
HAVE BEEN PROMISED BEFORE AND

76
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:20,546
HAD THE RUG PULLED OUT FROM ALL

77
00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:22,949
OF US BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME

78
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:24,016
PROGRESS MADE, KIM JONG UN IS AT

79
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:25,885
THE TABLE AND WALKED ACROSS THE

80
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:27,887
DMZ LAST NIGHT THAT WAS

81
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:28,354
SOMETHING.

82
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:29,188
>> IT'S BEEN PROGRESS MADE BUT

83
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:35,394
WE ARE NOT ACROSS THE FINISH

84
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,530
LINE YET AND THE PRESIDENT WANTS

85
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,966
TO RAISE HAND IN VICTORY BEFORE

86
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:41,434
WE GET FINISH LINE AND WE HAVE

87
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:43,636
TO BE STRATEGIC AND THINK

88
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:45,404
LONG-TERM WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUE

89
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:47,473
OF FOREIGN POLICY BECAUSE THIS

90
00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:50,676
WAS SUPERCEDE TRUMP, THIS WILL

91
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:51,544
SUPERCEDE HIS ADMINISTRATION,

92
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:54,180
THIS WILL SUPERCEDE A

93
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,214
REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED CONGRESS,

94
00:02:55,214 --> 00:02:57,583
THIS WILL SUPERCEDE PARTISAN

95
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,884
POLITICS IN THE COUNTRY.

96
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:00,286
WE HAVE TO BE STRATEGIC AND

97
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:02,455
SMART ABOUT ANY FOREIGN POLICY

98
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:03,656
DECISION GOING FORWARD.

99
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:05,057
ROB: AS FAR AS IRAN GOES, YOU

100
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:06,258
HAVE DEMOCRATS LIKE WE HAVE

101
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:07,760
CHRIS COONS ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY

102
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,229
WITH CHRIS WALLACE SAYING THAT

103
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:11,464
THERE IS AN IDEA FOR A BETTER

104
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:13,599
DEAL ON THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL,

105
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,634
DEMOCRATS ADMITTING THAT THAT

106
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:16,202
DEAL WASN'T THAT GREAT, THAT WE

107
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:18,604
COULD MAKE THAT A LOT BETTER.

108
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:20,206
>> OF COURSE, WE COULD HAVE MADE

109
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:21,374
IT A LOT BETTER BUT I THINK WE

110
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:23,709
HAVE TO GET OUT THIS NOTION OF

111
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,579
THE REDO AND UNDO POLICIES,

112
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,147
SOUND BITE AND TWEET PURPOSES,

113
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:29,482
WE HAVE TO REALLY THINK

114
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:30,716
LONG-TERM AND BE STRATEGIC ABOUT

115
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:31,884
WHAT WE DO.

116
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:33,786
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

117
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:37,923
DOUBT THAT ADDING STRINGS

118
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:42,895
ATTACHED, WE SHOULD HAVE REAL

119
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:45,831
INSPECTORS INSTEAD OF IRAN

120
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:47,199
TELLING US TED CRUZ OKAY.

121
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,334
WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GOING

122
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,569
TO WORK GREAT OR NOT, THE

123
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,506
COUNTRY SHOULD BE GENUINELY

124
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:54,373
EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

125
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:57,076
IF WE SOLVE THE KOREAN CONFLICT,

126
00:03:57,076 --> 00:03:59,178
IF THIS ADMINISTRATION SOLVES

127
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:00,713
THE KOREAN CONFLICT THAT WOULD

128
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:05,317
BE MONUMENTAL AND HISTORIC

129
00:04:05,317 --> 00:04:05,751
CONTRIBUTION.

130
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:11,190
WE SHOULD BE ROOTING FOR THIS --

131
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,860
ROB: LET ME CUT THAT OFF.

132
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,130
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MEDIA, THE

133
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,832
DEMOCRATS GIVING THE PRESIDENT

134
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:21,033
CREDIT AS FAR AS SOME

135
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:25,805
ACCOMPLISHMENTS HE HAS HAD.

136
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:29,275
ANTONE YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT

137
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:30,576
GETS IN HIS OWN WAY.

138
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:32,044
>> AS SOON AS IT'S TIME FOR HIM

139
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:33,579
TO GET CREDIT WHERE HE'S

140
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:35,848
PARTIALLY DUE HE GETS DISTRACTED

141
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:37,383
BY A TWEET AND OTHER MATTER AND

142
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:39,685
THE ATTENTION GETS AWAY FROM

143
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:41,987
WHERE HE EARNS CREDIT.  I'M NOT

144
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:43,756
ONE THAT YOU SHOULD GET CREDIT

145
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:45,491
FOR AN ASSIGNMENT UNTIL IT'S

146
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:46,525
COMPLETE AND THE REPUBLICAN

147
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:47,960
PARTY AND RIGHT-WING MEDIA WANTS

148
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,396
TO DO THAT, I'VE NEVER LIVED BY

149
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:51,464
THAT CONCEPT.

150
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:53,599
ROB: RON, THE PRESIDENT'S PERMIT

151
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:55,267
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN BE A LOT

152
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,737
TO DIGEST BUT THERE HAVE BEEN

153
00:04:57,737 --> 00:04:59,071
GREAT STRIDES MADE, A LOT OF

154
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:00,773
PEOPLE LOVE THE IDEA OF TAKING

155
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:02,475
BACK SOME RIGHTS IN TRADE DEALS

156
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,310
AND MAKING THE DEALS FAIR, IT'S

157
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,811
VERY REFLESHING AFTER ALL THESE

158
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,513
YEARS OF LOSING IN SOME OF THE

159
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:09,115
DEALS, RIGHT?

160
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:11,350
>> IT'S SO FUNNY, THE DEMOCRATS

161
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,018
ATTACKED -- THEY CAN'T ATTACK

162
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:15,921
THE POLICY BECAUSE TAX CUTS ARE

163
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:16,989
WORKING --

164
00:05:16,989 --> 00:05:18,958
>> TAX CUTS ARE NOT WORKING,

165
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,893
RON.

166
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:22,495
>> THEY ATTACK PERSONALITY WHEN

167
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:24,497
THE PERSONALITY IS ACTUALLY

168
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:28,134
HELPING ON POLICY, THERE'S NO

169
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:29,835
DOUBT PERSONALITY THAT'S THE

170
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:31,504
ARE WITH NORTH KOREA, THEY ARE

171
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:32,838
AFRAID OF TRUMP AND THAT'S ONE

172
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:34,540
OF THE REASONS THEY ARE COMING

173
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,776
TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.

174
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:37,710
SAME THING ON TRADE.

175
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,844
WITHOUT THE PERSONALITY AND THIS

176
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:40,079
APPROACH, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT

177
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,515
WE COULD NOT BE WHERE WE ARE

178
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:44,183
WITHOUT THIS STYLE OF

179
00:05:44,183 --> 00:05:45,785
PRESIDENCY.

180
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:47,086
>> RON, NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN

181
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:48,888
HERE BEFORE LET'S NOT BE FOOLED

182
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:50,456
THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE THE

183
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:51,791
POSITION THEY'VE TAKEN BEFORE

184
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,725
WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS

185
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:53,325
POSITION BEFORE.

186
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:54,693
ROB WILL BE WE DON'T KNOW.

187
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:57,930
WE HAVE TO WRAP IT UP THERE, WE

188
00:05:57,930 --> 00:00:00,000
ARE CERTAINLY TAKING A DIFFERENT
