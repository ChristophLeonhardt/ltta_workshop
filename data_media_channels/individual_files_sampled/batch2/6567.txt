cNN has been speaking to Trump voters ever since he's been elected and I love these panels that they do with the voters because it kind of gauges where they're at in regard to their support for Trump have they lost their support for Trump considering all of the different scandals he's been involved in the infighting the drama on Twitter well Allison cammarata is usually the CNN reporter who speaks to them and she wanted to know whether or not the latest kerfuffle involving the NFL impacted their support take a look at what they had to say how many of you are feeling just as positively today about Donald Trump as you were on election day two of you how many of you were having some second thoughts or reservations or regret your vote three of you okay so Jordan what was the moment that you started regretting your vote a lot of it had to do with his choices for cabinet officials I'm a high school teacher his choice for the Secretary of Education is completely unacceptable to me and most of my colleagues why what's the problem with Betsy DeVos experience she now is in charge of public education she doesn't seem to believe in it and that was a very big detriment to me Peyton what was the moment that you started having second thoughts he's a businessman I thought he could get the deals done and once I started seeing that he was too busy tweeting or not really understanding the kind of way Congress and politics really works I was a little disappointed what did you think he could pull off I was hoping for his travel ban to kind of go through and not be so divisive I was hoping for a health care repeal and replace mark how about you I think it was the day after inauguration day Wow yeah so just to elaborate on that very last answer he was annoyed with Trump over the whole crowd sizes issue he thought that it was ridiculous and petty and he wanted him to focus on more important things like you know the stuff he promised when he campaigned yeah so look these guys as you can tell them their answers want him to do the things that he promised there we don't agree with them there Trump voters I don't want the Muslim and I don't want the repeal or replace what they do but they're signing it and order them by the way you think I CNN fake news well no no they have these panels is the first time that I've ever seen a majority flip or even really a significant minority it one panel that was done recently it wasn't CNN to be fair it was another group it was 25 for 25 they all were still supporting Trump right they had not turned it all and most of the CNN panels no one had turned this one finally three out of five of turn yeah they've turned it I think it's because enough time has gone by where they're realizing okay there are no legislative wins and at the same time things have become more divisive politics has become more polarized and it's discouraging so it's look it's I'm happy that people are at least aware and they're waking up and they're not just blindly supporting him because they voted for him now this isn't a representative sample obviously but it still kind of gives you an idea of what some of his supporters are thinking okay just before going to the next one it's a couple of quick notes and you see the variety of reasons why their attorney and so I think the first guy is probably a little bit of an outlier but we've covered case like that before they didn't really realize that he was actually going to do the things that he said some portion of his voters so we covered the story of the guys down on the border who were all voted for Trump in Texas and they're like oh but he's gonna build a wall right through my property well that sucks Gore's didn't you hear any of the things that he said and so and then the guys who have had their friend and neighbor deported in the middle of the country and they're like well I didn't know he was gonna deport the good guys I thought he was gonna do the bad hombres this case he's like oh he really meant it when he said he was gonna cut public education and he did and he put somebody in charge so that's him promise he on his delivering on his bad promises this right that they thought no no don't take him seriously don't take him literally but but I think so but I think that most of it is guys realizing what we were saying all along but they're not their job is not politics or to do a show so they weren't knee-deep in it they just saw hey that guy's talking like human being versus another one that's talking like a robot and the establishment a regular politician I can't stand so what they missed was his incompetence that's why I did the loser Donald segment that's why I did a hundred different stories literally before the election to tell you how incompetent he is I didn't talk about what a bad guy he was I talked about what a loser he is and now this his supporters going I didn't know he wasn't gonna get anything accomplished right exactly yeah now in the next video they specifically address Donald Trump's tweets to NFL players who refuse to stand during the national anthem how many of you are comfortable with the president weighing in on what's happening during the national anthem and some players taking a knee are you happy that the president talked about it this weekend or tweeted about it nobody's happy that the president waited I think that these players have the First Amendment right to kneel during the national anthem or set out and it's just an argument that really didn't need to be picked and now it's what everybody's talking about when there are so many other things that we could be talking about like the hurricane in Puerto Rico so why is President Trump weighing in on this I think it's because he loves America I don't like the disrespect that these players are showing but on the other hand as my husband and I both say we may not like it but my husband served 21 years my brother-in-law died in service to guarantee both the NFL players rights to free speech and the president's right of free speech I'm a son of a grandson of veterans and I was always taught that I might not like what you say but I'll defend to the death your right to say it and that's what the First Amendment's about and that's what this country's about oh my god that made me feel so good yeah yeah you see that there's holes back for Cathy Gibson especially right like you don't have to like it but you're right I mean that's what our soldiers fight for to maintain democracy and freedom in this country and that's what they're doing they're practicing their First Amendment rights having the president urge NFL owners or her team owners to fire them is crazy yeah so look for the Payton the guy on the left side remember he was the one that's in favor of the travel what he calls a travel ban which is in reality a Muslim ban it's not like he didn't sign on for discriminatory policies but he's not like Trump where Trump is actively racist and and that's the whole point whether it's the travel ban or attacking black players for being against police brutality etc Payton is like well in their way I don't get it they're Americans they do get to have their opinion okay so even if some people might be in favor of discriminatory policies I don't agree with the still their heart might not be in the wrong place and we have to keep an open mind about that - well there's certainly not anywhere near where Donald Trump is in terms of actively disliking these different groups and and working against them absolutely and just one comment in regards to the guy that you were talking about who's in favor of the Muslim ban you know I gotta give him credit for bringing up the issue of Puerto Rico because you know and this is my bad this is my fault my bias but I would have just assumed that Trump voters don't care about Puerto Rico you know what I'm saying and so to hear someone who voted for Trump and who supported Trump's say that it just shows you you know the human side that you know oftentimes the media does get dehumanize dehumanized because of some of the more hateful rhetoric that they've supported from Trump yeah yeah in fact he he said in another part of the interview that he was he didn't understand why Trump was more eager to attack the black NFL players than neo-nazis yeah that's a great point it's a great point and when Allison Cameron asked why do you think that is he said quote I wish I knew it completely baffles me and then Mark O'Brien one of the guys who just saw there said about him talking about that NFL is instead of criticizing neo-nazis he says that is a huge concern of mine what is going on in that man's mind so this is really heartening because more so than hey we're gonna get them politically and all that talk no no it's it's encouraging to see that yes still at the end of the day some Republican voters unlike Trump do understand the point of the country they do understand that we can disagree but still your respect to freedom of speech and respect other races and beautiful I guess things like neo-nazis of course of course that should be the case but with Trump you know when I have two shrouds so there's like I mean they're good people on both sides he hasn't even said they're good people on both sides of the kneeling issue he just calls them sons of bitches and says they should be fired it's crazy it is absolutely nuts and it's good to see that that really conservative Americans are saying hey we get it we know what this country is about and it is diversity of opinion and we're all allowed to have our opinions and it's weird that the president doesn't understand that if you like this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
