THAT'S MORE THAN A HAT BUT DEFENSIVE PERIMETER. REPORTER: IT'S OPEN SEASON WHEN IT COMES TO HOLLYWOOD. FROM THE LATE NIGHT COMICS TO BIGGEST STARS. CELEBRITIES HAVE NO QUALMS ABOUT WEARING THEIR POLITICS ON THEIR LIVES. HOW LIBERAL IS HOLLYWOOD? VERY LIBERAL. I WOULD ESTIMATE 97%. REPORTER: THAT'S WHY IT WAS SURPRISING WHEN REPORTER: THAT'S WHY IT WAS SURPRISING WHEN ROSANNE SPOKE ABOUT TRUMP. THE PREMIER WAS GANGBUSTERS. 18 MILLION PEOPLE TUNED IN. THERE WASN'T A SINGLE PERSON SURPRISED BY THE RATINGS. EVEN EXPERTS DOING THIS MUCH LONGER THAN I HAVE WERE SHOCKED. REPORTER: THE PRESIDENT SAID ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES THE SHOW UNIQUE IS QUOTE IT'S FOCUSING ON A FAMILY IN DIFFERENT ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAN OTHER COMEDIES ON THE AIR. BUT ROSANNE THE ACTOR CONTINUES TO TALK ABOUT TRUMP. YOU ARE NOT IN TROUBLE AND EXPRESSING YOUR VIEWS AS CRAZY AS THEY MAY BE.
