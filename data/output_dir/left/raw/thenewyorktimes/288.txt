1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,770
This story begins with a
young group of Kurds in Syria

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,600
resisting attacks
by Turkish forces.

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,125
It ends in flames.

4
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,660
What happens in between gives
us a rare and intimate look

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,450
at how two sides fight
on a modern battlefield.

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,970
And it shows just
how unaware one side

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,350
can be to the dangers
that are lurking above.

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,130
We’ve pieced together
frontline footage

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,390
to track the units’
movements over several days,

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,440
how they targeted
advancing forces,

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,780
and how they may
have met their end.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,040
But first, how did these
fighters end up here?

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,320
In January, Turkey
launched an offensive

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,450
into Syria’s northwest.

15
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,190
It’s mostly a Kurdish area.

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,780
And Turkey regards certain
Kurds as terrorists.

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,129
The fighters’ license
plate is for Afrin,

18
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,030
which is a strategic
objective of Turkey.

19
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,730
Standing in its way is
the town of Jinderes,

20
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,630
a crucial junction.

21
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,680
This is where we located
the Kurdish fighters.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,560
You can see that over time,
Turkish and Allied ground

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,750
forces close in on Jinderes.

24
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,070
They’re already overhead.

25
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,490
This edited drone footage
was released by Turkey.

26
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,290
And along with other
video, it helps

27
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,010
us analyze the Kurds’
defensive of Jinderes.

28
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,910
They’re using an M40-series
106-millimeter recoilless

29
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,920
rifle.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,050
It’s a pre-Vietnam War weapon
and relatively simple to use.

31
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,590
It’s most accurate when
the gun’s crew can visually

32
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,300
identify their target.

33
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,200
But this crew seems to be firing
towards targets they can’t see,

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,390
elevating the barrel
to shoot over buildings

35
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,580
that block their view.

36
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,680
That kind of indiscriminate fire
can risk civilian casualties.

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,470
On Feb. 10, we located
the Kurds’ position

38
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,120
and determine their
direction of fire.

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,580
They’re firing towards a town
that had just been taken over

40
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,520
by Turkish-backed forces.

41
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,730
Two days later, the Kurdish
fighters moved their position,

42
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,190
and they shifted fire
in this direction.

43
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,280
Again, it corresponds
with territory

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,690
the enemy had just gained
after days of heavy fighting.

45
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,810
It seems the Kurds are keenly
aware of the closing threat.

46
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,290
The drone tracks
them to a garage

47
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,950
and identifies the target.

48
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,260
The building is hit from above.

49
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,420
Kurdish forces say
the gun crew was killed.

50
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,940
But there’s one more thing.

51
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,080
Remember, this drone video
was released as propaganda.

52
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,670
It shows a precise strike,
no collateral damage.

53
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,460
But that rarely happens.

54
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,490
Civilians have been killed
in other Turkish strikes.

55
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,010
And human rights organizations
say some of these

56
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,360
may be unlawful.

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,050
And the Kurds have fired
at civilian areas, too.

58
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,860
And as the Turkish offensive
moves towards more urban areas,

59
00:03:16,860 --> 00:00:00,000
the fighting is likely
to get even more complex.
