that young man who gave the finger and said that rather disciplining remark his name's Bronson Harmon he was counter protesting a protest against Trump's immigration policy and had his wrestling scholarship at Cal Poly taken away from him after that video went viral now the school's athletic director Don uber Hellman said that Cal Poly can take away financial aid if a student does something that embarrasses the school now if that sounds like something that violates free speech to you well you're not the only one I spoke with Josh Smith a Pennsylvania attorney who's helping Bronson but isn't licensed to represent him against the school in California Smith said you can't condition a scholarship on someone waving their First Amendment rights they can attach conditions but one of those reasons they're saying it brings embarrassment to the school can't be because of pure speech the attorney pointed out that Bronson's conduct took place off campus and that an event that had nothing to do with the school Smith also was wondering just where the heck the Justice Department is when it comes to defending student speech I want to see the aggressiveness that the Obama administration had towards these schools with it's obviously unwise title nine expansions he said I want to see that level of aggressiveness in sessions Department of Justice when it comes to protecting the First Amendment on campus they can hold the specter of federal funding over these colleges heads and that is exactly what sessions should do money makes the world go around it's kind of like one of those for everything else there's MasterCard commercials for libs money is the ultimate incentive for everyone else there's just being a decent human being this isn't the first time Cal Poly's made the news this month either the school says it does not consider race in it in its admission process but sent out a letter noting that its percentage of whites has fallen from 63 to 55 percent from 2011 to 2017 saying it wants to bring its proportion of whites closer to that of California's which is at about 40% what so you don't consider race but you also want to decrease the percentage of whites that's like me saying I'm not going to inflict violence on you I'm just going to punch you nebulous feel-good words like diversity and social justice have allowed colleges to get away with outright discrimination they say the Ivy League schools set precedents for the rest of academia and so I guess we just better hope Harvard gets crushed in its Asian American discrimination case in October for campus unmasked I'm Rob Jim Shaw if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
