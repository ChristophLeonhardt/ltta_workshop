I'm curious you know I'm not curious because I mean I guess I know who these guys are I just in a noir in a vaguely normal world we'd be reading some stories somewhere about some group of Republicans if this were a normal political party who would be trying to persuade their colleagues that we ought to be the ones forcing them out of office because we're better off in 2018 this would be the argument they would be making I'm not saying they're right but they'd be arguing we're better off in 2018 with Mike Pence leading the ticket and Mike Pence leading the ticket in 2020 and we need to lead the charge to get rid of them and then we maintain that agenda than Paul Ryan and Mike Mike Pence present this agenda we fill the cabinet positions we continue to nominate conservatives the Supreme Court but we are the ones leading the charge against this guy who's putting this country in harm's way but you they'll never ever ever ever ever ever do that until it's already done like by the weight we'd signed in the show maybe I'll do a video about it later but Eric Holder with a very mysterious tweet at 3:00 a.m. yet last night saying hey remember good folks of the DOJ and FBI you'll be under a lot of pressure but we be strong duty country honor you know what that means that means Eric Holder knows something we don't know yeah and and that means when they go after Trump of course Trump's brown shirts are gonna go after them and he's telling them it's okay like you know don't don't get intimidated by these bullies and so I think that that so the Republicans will not act until they've seen the intelligence briefings with overwhelming evidence and three smoking guns then they'll be like oh yeah we never liked him in the first place and then McCain will one day and he will be happy to do this we'll get to use that great line that I've come up with Wharram I prefer presidents who haven't been impeached right Young Turks membership creates independent media believe me no ads believe me all the show believe me on demand believe me support independent media believe me it's awesome tremendous you'll love it believe me and by the end you'll be thinking you know I'm like a smart person tea white tea network.com /join
