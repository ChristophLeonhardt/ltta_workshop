most people start out sort of wondering if there is more to life wondering if there are states of complete satisfaction equanimity joy delight all and the short answer and suddenly the the premise of the book stealing fire is its hell yes there's several simple and easy ones that are available to all of us the first is engage in some kind of respiration or breathing practice fundamentally you know we have three gases in our lungs it's nitrogen oxygen and carbon dioxide and by breathing faster or slower and different rates and rhythms you can change that gaseous mix and you can completely and radically shift your consciousness from just being a little less stressed or a little bit more energized and poised for a high-stakes business meeting or a critical family conversation all the way to if you engage in some of the more radical techniques from free diving or from Navy SEAL prep and training all the way to completely shifting your state into into experiences that are comparable to in sense of intensive psychedelics breathing is a really simple one and it's portable and all have to keep doing it so let's get good at it the other is to simply exposure to the natural world but there are many studies everything from what they call forest bathing in Japan where people are going into the forest and either holding trees or hanging next to trees to mountain climbing to exposure to water a lot of these studies are showing that all comes from contemplating excess complexity and environment there's basically more happening in these environments than our brains can trigger and that creates a slowdown in brain waves a decrease in stress neuro chemistry and an increased coherence in our cardiac rhythms so breathe more move more we are disembodied heads on sticks these days just getting into our body not because I'm trying to you know fit into my high school jeans or get a six-pack not for vanity and aesthetics but for literally kinesthetics and cognitive functions so breathe move and get outside
