Donald Trump should stop talking about immigration until he figures out what the hell is immigration policy is he's had every position on immigration in the past 72 hours he's been saying that we're going to work with the immigrants oh there's going to be touchback amnesty oh you know they're gonna have to pay back taxes oh we're going to pour them all the only thing that's been consistent in the Trump campaign is the wall forty percent of all illegal immigrants come here legally they just overstayed their visa there isn't a mechanism to make sure that people who come in on a tourist visa or a business visa leave the country one other visas up and if they don't get it renewed Trump if you were serious about immigration would be talking about that you can see that Marco Rubio although he didn't get the nomination he did talk about a biometric ID system and checking to make sure exit visas were processed and having better tracking of that so we can do that and there's nothing controversial about saying if you come into the country we expect you to leave when your visa is up period
