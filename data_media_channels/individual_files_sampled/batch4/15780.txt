Justin Trudeau's want to take a bite out of your discounted staff meal the latest copy of the federal government's tax folio says and I quote when an employee receives a discount on merchandise because of their employment the value of the discount is generally included in the employees income with the value of the discount assessed at equal to the fair market value of the merchandise purchased less the amount paid by the employee unless the discount is available to the public or a segment of the public at some point during the year did you get all that it's in that word government lingo that is always way more complicated than it needs to be it's like these people get paid by the word what it means is the value of your employee discount gets added back into your income so you can get taxed on it if you get free coffee at work then the value of the coffee is added to your income so you can be taxed on it if a retail store offers an employee discount so that the staff wears the products they sell all the discounts are added back into the staffs yearly income for tax reasons employees are being taxed but not on the money they earned and not on the money they spend which is normally when the government gets you coming and going earning and spending no this time retailing restaurant workers are actually going to be taxed on the value of the money they didn't spend this brand new way to tax the working poor could come into effect as early as January 1st 2018 as Conservative MP and finance critic Pierre Paul yath put it now liberals think waitresses who get discounts on chicken salad at work are tax cheats to these folks getting these discounts are often minimum wage work earners trying to work their way up the financial ladder to better their situation and they're being shoved back down the same ladder by the federal government because they're saving a few bucks eating at work or buying their clothes at the retail store they work in it's outrageous these are the very same young people that Trudeau campaigned on helping well he got their votes and now he wants their stuff discounts too but this tax grab just isn't about the employees this is yet another attack on Canada's entrepreneurial class by Justin Trudeau think of the burden on the employers who will be trying to track the free soft drinks they provide their waitresses on shift the hours of time and headache to sort out how much of that pop is owed to the receiver general this tax change was obviously written by someone who's never employed anyone or has ever held a minimum-wage job some companies will undoubtedly eliminate employee discounts altogether rather than deal with the paperwork nightmare these tax changes will create for them and predictably some in the mainstream media are already running interference for the Liberals by saying the Canada Revenue Agency is taxing employee discounts look at this tweet from The Globe and Mail it says CRA to begin taxing employee discounts okay technically that's true but the headline is sheltering Trudeau and Bill Morneau from the blame they so richly deserve the CRA doesn't make changes to the tax code the government does in this case it's the Liberals as much as people including me resent the taxman they are only doing what the Finance Minister Bill Morneau has asked them to do Trudeau is wasting billions of taxpayer dollars actually spending in record numbers outside the country on foreign aid to help other countries fight things like well climate change and he gave away 10 million dollars to a convicted terrorist named Omar Khadr all the while nickel-and-diming hardworking Canadians just trying to earn a living and save a dollar here and there imagine being so elitist and out of touch that you aren't even able to predict how bad this would all look especially after the nationwide revolt against reduce tax grab on farmers and entrepreneurs but that's Trillo and Bill Morneau for you so silver spooned and pampered that they think people working there way through university are just a bunch of burger-flipping tax cheats the liberal tax grabs on anyone in the middle class or anyone who aspires to work their way into the middle class are never-ending if I were a bit of a conspiracy theorist I would say these elites want to make sure that no one ever works their way up the ladder to get anywhere near them but I don't think it's that complicated it's much more simple than that the Liberals just need money to fund their luxurious SJW efforts at home and across the globe and they will take it from anyone including those who can least afford it for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read these attacks by Justin Trudeau on entrepreneurs and the oil patch are well really nothing new we've seen them all at least once before from Trudeau's dad Pierre but we've got a plan to fight back go to just like his dad calm to see our plan to sign our petition and to donate today you
