do you know how badly justin trudeau is treating our Canadian Armed Forces it's worse than you think I'll show you this is an official publication of the Canadian Forces Base at Borden in Ontario it's a weekly newspaper called the Borden citizen read by people on the base or nearby look at this story on page 8 the story is called seasonal sharing basket campaign let me read the first sentence it is once again that time of year with the colder temperatures and the kids back in school the base will be kicking off this year's seasonal sharing basket campaign for 2017 all right sounds great our soldiers give so much to us and now they're even giving to Christmas hampers for the poor amazing but read the next sentence the goal of the SSP campaign is to assist those members of the CFB Borden defense team residing within the confines of CFB Borden and local area who are experiencing a time of need during the holiday season the privacy and confidentiality of individuals utilizing the support provided by the SSB will be respected individuals in need of support and interested in further details can speak with their unit padre unquote so this isn't to help some strangers down at the homeless shelter this is to help cfb soldiers who are so poor they literally can't afford to feed their families while living on the base soldiers are being asked to donate to other soldiers literally next door to them justin trudeau pays our soldier so little that they are forced to ask for charity and the Canadian Forces the newspaper is an official military publication is asking other soldiers to make up the gap basically to share their own grocery money because Trudeau won't Trudeau just gave ten point five million dollars to Omar Khadr and convicted al Qaeda terrorists who murdered a US soldier but Trudeau won't even pay our troops enough to feed their families Trudeau has social programs to help Isis terrorists back to Canada with art and poetry he's got millions of dollars for that but not enough for our troops to feed their families on a base this isn't for veterans I'm not talking about that although homelessness amongst veterans has skyrocketed under Trudeau he just doesn't care this is about soldiers who are actually living on the base they're too poor to buy groceries in September Trudeau kept the monthly allowance for soldiers who were wounded for more than 180 days seriously they're so hurt they need care for more than six months they're the most vulnerable but they're the ones Trudeau is cutting off in February Trudeau eliminated a danger pay tax credit of $1,500 a month for our soldiers in Kuwait imagine that you're over there away from your family you're in danger and Trudeau effectively gave you a $1,500 a month pay cut but it's got money for Omar Khadr the terrorist the official newspaper at CFB Borden is asking soldiers to help out other soldiers because Trudeau won't help them I am so angry at Trudeau I am so ashamed of our government I'm so furious that our mainstream media doesn't care I care today I set up an IndieGoGo page to raise $10,000 for the CFP board and food hamper go to feed our troops dot see a we'll send the money to this seasonal sharing basket they don't even use the word Christmas half or do they that would offend Omar Khadr they don't even say Christmas go to feed our troops dot CA I just put in the first $50 I think we can get to ten thousand dollars if you prefer to pay by cheque there's info on how to do that on the website IndieGoGo takes a few percent for their handling costs and credit card fees but a hundred percent of the net proceeds will go straight to this food bank and two other Canadian Forces food banks if we hear them Justin Trudeau hates our troops he's pushing them into poverty while making terrorists into millionaires but lets you and me do the right thing let's give to the Christmas hamper for soldiers at CFB Borden go to feed our troops dot CA I'll give you an update on this next week if you want to help with the Christmas hamper for our Canadian troops spread the word at feed our troops dot CA you
