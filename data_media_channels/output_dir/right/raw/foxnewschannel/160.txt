00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:12,524
STOLEN YEARS OF YOUR LIFE, YEARS

3
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:13,291
THAT YOU WILL NEVER GET BACK IN

4
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:18,797
SEARCH OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION.

5
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:20,899
THE HUNT FOR IT LEFT BROKEN

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,601
CREDIBILITY ACROSS THE BOARD,

7
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:24,269
PARTICULARLY AT THE JUSTICE

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:24,669
DEPARTMENT.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,604
THE FBI FOR EXAMPLE STARTED

10
00:00:26,605 --> 00:00:27,806
SPYING ON CARTER PAGE A U.S.

11
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:29,374
CITIZEN WHO WENT TO THE

12
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,076
NAVAL ACADEMY AND SERVED AS A

13
00:00:31,077 --> 00:00:33,011
NAVAL OFFICER BASED ON A

14
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:33,678
POLITICAL MOTIVATED, STILL

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,880
UNCORROBORATED SERIES OF

16
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,582
ALLEGATIONS FROM FUSION GPS

17
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,718
WHICH WAS AN ARM OF THE HILLARY

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,786
CAMPAIGN.

19
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:42,487
NOW FUSION GPS FOUNDER GLENN

00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:45,924
SIMPSON IS AVOIDING          PLE

21

SIMPSON IS AVOIDING          PLD

SIMPSON IS AVOIDING          PLN

SIMPSON IS AVOIDING          PLO

30
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:50,695
AVOID TESTIFYING BEFORE

31
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:51,062
CONGRESS.

32
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:52,864
DEVIN NUNES JOINS US TONIGHT.

33
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:54,899
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING

34
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,401
ON.

35
00:00:56,402 --> 00:00:58,603
BEFORE I ASK ABOUT GLENN SIMPSON

36
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:00,371
AND WHY YOU THINK HE MIGHT NOT

37
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:02,440
BE TESTIFYING, I WANT TO GET AN

38
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,008
UPDATE ON THE DOCUMENTS THAT THE

39
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:05,076
REST OF US WERE SUPPOSED TO SEE,

40
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:08,480
MOST SPECIFICALLY THE FISA

41
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:11,583
WARRANT THAT ALLOWED THE SPYING

42
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:12,851
THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

43
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:14,786
DID ON CARTER PAGE, ARE WE EVER

44
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:16,187
GOING TO FIND OUT THE

45
00:01:16,188 --> 00:01:16,621
JUSTIFICATION?

46
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:18,590
>> YEARS OF YOUR LIFE AND YOU'RE

47
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:20,992
NOT GETTING BACK, MANY AMERICANS

48
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:21,993
INCLUDING MYSELF -- I THINK

49
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:22,994
THAT'S A GREAT OPENING.

50
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:23,728
IF WE ARE VERY FRUSTRATED THAT

51
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,030
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET

52
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:27,232
THESE DOCUMENTS OUT.

53
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:28,600
THE PRESIDENT ORDERED THEM AND

54
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:29,534
THEN YOU HAVE ROD ROSENSTEIN WHO

55
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:31,336
GOT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

56
00:01:31,337 --> 00:01:34,005
I WOULD BE FINE IF HE HAD A REAL

57
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,974
REASON BUT EVERY TIME HE SAID HE

58
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:38,376
HAD A REASON TO BLOCK THIS

59
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:39,844
INFORMATION, IT ENDS UP BEING

60
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:40,578
FALSE.

61
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,080
NOW YOU HAVE ROD ROSENSTEIN WHO

62
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:44,782
WON'T TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS.

63
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:46,184
ARE WE GOING TO SEE THIS

64
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:46,584
INFORMATION?

65
00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:48,386
I GUESS WE ARE WAITING, THE

66
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:49,120
PRESIDENT PUT THE IG IN CHARGE

67
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:51,422
OF IT -- HOROWITZ.

68
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:52,690
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS A GOOD

69
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:53,391
IDEA.

70
00:01:53,392 --> 00:01:54,559
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT'S

71
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,228
WHAT WE'RE COUNTING ON.

72
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,062
>> Tucker: AT SOME POINT YOU

73
00:01:58,063 --> 00:01:59,998
ASK WHAT'S THE POINT OF VOTING?

74
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:02,400
YOU ELECT A NEW GUY BUT THE SAME

75
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:03,368
PEOPLE ARE IN CHARGE SUPPORTING

76
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:05,270
WHAT YOU WANT.

77
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:06,271
IT DOES CALL INTO QUESTION

78
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:06,804
DEMOCRACY ITSELF.

79
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:08,506
DO YOU THINK ANY MEMBER OF

80
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:09,407
CONGRESS WOULD BE WILLING TO

81
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:10,007
TAKE THE RISK.

82
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,543
AS AN AMERICAN, I THINK YOU HAVE

83
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:16,181
A RIGHT TO SEE THIS.

84
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:18,449
>> THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS WE

85
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:25,290
CAN TALK ABOUT -- WE TALKED

86
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:29,294
ABOUT THIS ON OUR SHOW -- WE

87
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:30,094
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN H

88
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:30,261
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN E

89
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:30,295
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN H

90
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:30,328
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN U

91
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:30,395
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN E

92
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:30,428
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN F

93
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:30,461
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN O

94
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:30,662
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN R

95
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:30,695
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN A

96
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:31,095
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN D

97
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:31,129
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN S

98
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,162
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN A

99
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:31,863
CAN'T MARCH THE DOCUMENTS DOWN P

100
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:32,730
THEM DOWN.

101
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:34,299
THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE IN

102
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,033
POSSESSION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

103
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:35,600
JUSTICE AND THE FBI.

104
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:40,672
THERE SHOULD BE NO REASON, WE'VE

105
00:02:40,673 --> 00:02:42,340
BEEN NARROWLY FOCUSED ON 20

106
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:43,308
PAGES THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN SIGNED

107
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:45,777
AND I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD BE

108
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:46,878
IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

109
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,112
OF WHETHER OR NOT THE AMERICAN

110
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:49,681
PEOPLE SHOULD SEE THESE OR NOT.

111
00:02:49,682 --> 00:02:51,482
>> Tucker: I AGREE WITH THAT

112
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:51,883
COMPLETELY.

113
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:53,151
LET ME ASK YOU TO SUM IT UP

114
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:54,152
SINCE YOU ARE PRIVY TOO MUCH

115
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:56,287
MORE INFORMATION THAN THE

116
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:59,390
AVERAGE PERSON -- HAVE YOU SEEN

117
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:00,892
AND ANSWER THIS KNOWING IN THE

118
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:03,094
END WERE GOING TO KNOW ALL THE

119
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:03,695
FACTS.

120
00:03:03,696 --> 00:03:05,163
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY EVIDENCE THERE

121
00:03:05,164 --> 00:03:06,331
WAS COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP

122
00:03:06,332 --> 00:03:08,333
CAMPAIGN IN THE RUSSIAN

123
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:09,133
GOVERNMENT?

124
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:11,736
>> NO I HAVE NOT, AND IN FACT I

125
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:12,971
SEE THE OPPOSITE THAT WE KNOW

126
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:13,705
FOR SURE.

127
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:15,106
YOU'RE GOING TO ASK ME ABOUT

128
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:16,174
GLENN SIMPSON IN A SECOND AND I

129
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:18,076
HATE TO JUMP AHEAD.

130
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:22,213
GLENN SIMPSON, WAS WORKING FOR

131
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:23,014
THE DEMOCRATS.

132
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:24,749
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.

133
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,085
HE GOT INFORMATION FROM

134
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:27,952
RUSSIANS, THAT INFORMATION WAS

135
00:03:27,953 --> 00:03:31,322
FED INTO THE FBI.

136
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:32,223
GLENN SIMPSON WAS SPREADING THAT

137
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,726
INFORMATION OUT TO THE PRESS AND

138
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:35,693
NOW WE KNOW GLENN SIMPSON WAS

139
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:39,797
MEETING WITH THE FBI LONG BEFORE

140
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:41,466
HE TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS THAT HE

141
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:44,068
WAS MEETING WITH THE FBI.

142
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:45,903
THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO LIKELY LIED

143
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:47,672
TO CONGRESS, SHOULD PROBABLY BE

144
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:48,539
PROSECUTED WHICH IS LIKELY WHY

145
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,675
TODAY HE PLED THE FIFTH AND

146
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:52,610
REFUSED TO TESTIFY BEFORE

147
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:53,177
CONGRESS.

148
00:03:53,178 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: IT IS SO
