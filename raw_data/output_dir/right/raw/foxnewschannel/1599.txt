1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,409
>> Neil: I THINK THE BLANKENSHIP

2
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:15,312
HAS HIT THE FAN, NO PUN

3
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:15,912
INTENDED.

4
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:17,180
DON BLANKENSHIP THAT LOST THE

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,482
WEST VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN PRIMARY

6
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:24,721
IS GOING TO RUN AS A THIRD-PARTY

7
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:25,155
CANDIDATE.

8
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:27,124
THAT COULD MONEY THAT JOE

9
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,458
MANCHIN COULD SQUEAK IN AND

10
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,527
REMAIN A DEMOCRATIC SEAT.

11
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:32,462
WE HAVE KATIE HERE WITH US AND

12
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:35,632
FORMER OHIO DEMOCRATIC STATE

13
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:39,469
SENATOR, CAPRI CAFARO.

14
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,638
THIS COULD CHANGE THE DYNAMICS.

15
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:42,839
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:43,974
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

17
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:45,442
THERE'S A NUMBER OF HURDLES THAT

18
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:46,443
BLANKENSHIP WILL HAVE TO COME

19
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:47,978
THROUGH FOR HIM TO GET ON THE

20
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:48,578
BALL LOT.

21
00:00:48,578 --> 00:00:51,381
HE HAS TO HAVE SIGNATURES TO GET

22
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:54,985
HIM ON AS A THIRD-PARTY

23
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:56,052
CANDIDATE.

24
00:00:56,052 --> 00:00:58,288
HE COULD BE SUED UNDER THE SORE

25
00:00:58,288 --> 00:00:58,922
LOSER LAW.

26
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:00,323
>> Neil: YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK IT

27
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:00,824
WAS POSSIBLE.

28
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:02,592
BUT THE WAY HE'S GOING ABOUT IT,

29
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:05,227
HE COULD DO IT THAT CONFUSED ME.

30
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:08,765
>> BOTTOM LINE IF HE PULLS IT

31
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:12,769
OFF, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT HE

32
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:15,205
SPLIT THE ANTI-DEMOCRAT PRO

33
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:16,573
TRUMP VOTE AND REALLY CONNED

34
00:01:16,573 --> 00:01:18,208
HAND THE SEAT BACK TO JOE

35
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:18,842
MANCHIN.

36
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:22,178
THIS IS REALLY NOT GOOD NEWS FOR

37
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:23,079
THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT,

38
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,981
NOR THE REPUBLICANS BEING ABLE

39
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:28,084
TO HOLD ON TO THAT SEAT IN WEST

40
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:28,451
VIRGINIA.

41
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:31,221
>> WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS

42
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,956
SAYING HE DIDN'T FARE THAT WELL.

43
00:01:32,956 --> 00:01:35,458
THE PEOPLE WOULD ETHER VOTE FOR

44
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,360
HIM ON THE NOMINEE OF THE

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,629
ATTORNEY GENERAL ARE MORE

46
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,034
INCLINED TO VOTE REPUBLICAN

47
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:44,467
ANYWAY.

48
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:45,235
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

49
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:46,403
>> I THINK THAT'S CORRECT.

50
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:50,006
AT THE SAME TIME, HE IS GOING TO

51
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:53,043
DRAW A WAY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF

52
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:53,410
VOTERS.

53
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:58,281
HE WILL INJECTED DISCORD AND

54
00:01:58,281 --> 00:01:58,615
CHAOS.

55
00:01:58,615 --> 00:02:00,817
HE WILL BE A ROY MOORE AND

56
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:03,520
THAT'S NOT WHAT REPUBLICANS NEED

57
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,855
TO THEY MANCHIN'S SENATE SEAT.

58
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:07,424
IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE WHEN YOU

59
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:09,425
HAVE EFFECTIVELY 50 SEATS IN THE

60
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:11,661
SENATE WITH SENATOR McCAIN IN

61
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:14,864
ARIZONA, YOU NEED TO EFFECTIVELY

62
00:02:14,864 --> 00:02:16,599
TAKE THIS AWAY.

63
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,068
BLANKENSHIP COULD RUIN THAT.

64
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:19,335
>> AND I DON'T KNOW HOW POLLING

65
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:21,070
IS GOING IN THE STATE.

66
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,006
MANCHIN IS IN THE RACE OF HIS

67
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:23,306
LIFE.

68
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:24,841
I WAS TRYING TO PLAY THIS OWN IN

69
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:27,844
MY OWN HEAD AND THINKING IF HE

70
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:31,481
DOES MANAGE TO GET ON A THIRD

71
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:36,019
PARTY BALLOT, HE WILL DEMAND

72
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,021
ATTENDANCE AT DEBATES.

73
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:40,823
IF I'M JOE MANCHIN, SAYING IF

74
00:02:40,823 --> 00:02:43,359
HE'S NOT INCLUDED, I DON'T WANT

75
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:43,893
TO GO THERE.

76
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:45,161
IT COULD CREATE A DRAMA.

77
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:47,664
>> IT COULD BE THE REPUBLICANS

78
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:51,734
WORST NIGHT NIGHTMARE.

79
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:54,304
ATTORNEY GENERAL MORRISEY IS

80
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,139
DEALING MANCHIN BY TWO.

81
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:58,241
IT'S ONE OF THE FIVE TRUE

82
00:02:58,241 --> 00:02:59,642
REALISTIC PICKUPS THAT

83
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:00,476
REPUBLICANS HAVE IN THE UNITED

84
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:01,444
STATES SENATE.

85
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:04,180
SO ESSENTIALLY IF BLANKENSHIP

86
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,884
WINS OUT, BEATS THE SORE LOSER

87
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:12,121
LAWS, 1 OR 2 TAKEN AWAY FROM

88
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:14,524
MORRISEY WILL HAND IT TO MANCHIN

89
00:03:14,524 --> 00:03:17,026
IN A STATE THAT REPUBLICAN WON

90
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:18,027
BY 20 POINTS.

91
00:03:18,027 --> 00:03:20,163
>> Neil: AND IN THE HOUSE, THEY

92
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:21,364
STILL TALK A BLUE WAVE.

93
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:23,700
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A VERY GOOD

94
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,301
SHOT AT INCREASING THEIR MARGIN

95
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,035
IN THE SENATE.

96
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:27,603
EVEN WITH THIS, DO THEY NOT?

97
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:28,771
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

98
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:31,240
I JUST RECENTLY READ AN ARTICLE

99
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,276
TALKING ABOUT -- I BELIEVE IT

100
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:35,411
WAS FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.

101
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:39,182
IT SAID IN 2012, CLAIRE

102
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:41,217
McCASKILL WAS ON THE BALLOT.

103
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:43,352
SHE PULLED IT OUT THERE.

104
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:45,488
SHE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT IS ON THE

105
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:47,924
FENCE, FIGHTING FOR HER LEAF IN

106
00:03:47,924 --> 00:03:48,724
THIS CIRCLE.

107
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:50,626
BECAUSE BARACK OBAMA IS NOT ON

108
00:03:50,626 --> 00:03:52,962
THE BALLOT, THEY'RE BASICALLY

109
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:53,729
PROJECTING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

110
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:55,464
VOTE THAT HAS TRADITIONALLY

111
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:56,899
VOTED DEMOCRATIC WILL SIT AT

112
00:03:56,899 --> 00:03:57,500
HOME.

113
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,601
THEY COULD HAVE MADE THE

114
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,702
DIFFERENCE FOR CLAIRE McCASKILL

115
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:00,570
IN 2012.

116
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,638
THEY WON'T BE THERE IN 2018.

117
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:04,240
THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF A PLACE

118
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,142
WHERE TURNOUT WILL MAKE ALL THE

119
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:07,343
DIFFERENCE IN WHETHER OR NOT

120
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:10,046
DEMOCRATS CAN PICK UP OR RIDE

121
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:13,316
SOME KINDS OF A THEORETICAL BLUE

122
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:16,017
WAVE, WHICH I THINK IS MORE OF A

123
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:16,886
BLUE TRICKLE.

124
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:19,321
>> KATIE, IN ORDER TO GET A BLUE

125
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:20,856
WAVE, PEOPLE HAVE TO BE IN A

126
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:24,260
MOOD FOR A MOMENTOUS SHIFT.

127
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,861
IF THE ECONOMY IS SEEMED TO BE

128
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:27,163
BETTER THAN IT WAS AND THE VIEW

129
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:28,264
OF PEOPLE'S OWN SENSE OF

130
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:31,400
PERSONAL VALUE IS BETTER THAN IT

131
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:33,335
WAS, JOB SECURITY FOR THEIR KIDS

132
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:35,438
BETTER THAN IT WAS, MAYBE WE'RE

133
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:36,772
MISSING SOMETHING HERE.

134
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:37,907
>> THEY ARE.

135
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:39,875
DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE.

136
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,278
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ONE DURING THE

137
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:42,645
ELECTION.

138
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:43,479
THEY LEARNED NOTHING.

139
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:45,514
ON TOP OF THAT, NO ONE WANTS THE

140
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:47,082
MESSAGE TO BE WE'RE GOING TO

141
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:48,751
IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT.

142
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:50,186
EVERYTHING IS AWFUL AND THE

143
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:51,454
COMMIT IS TERRIBLE WHEN NONE OF

144
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:52,221
THAT IS TRUE.

145
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,622
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A LOT

146
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:54,457
GOING FOR THEM.

147
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:55,925
THE FIRST ROUND OF POLLS CAME

148
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:58,160
OUT SHOWING THAT THE DEMOCRATIC

149
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,762
EDGE IN THE MID-TERMS IS WITHIN

150
00:04:59,762 --> 00:05:01,430
THE MARGIN OF ERROR NOW.

151
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,032
THEIR LEAD HAS BEEN SLIMMING.

152
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:04,934
THIS ISN'T LOOKING GOOD FOR THEM

153
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:06,869
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE SO

154
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:07,303
DISORGANIZED.

155
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:09,405
>> Rick: WHAT DO REPUBLICANS

156
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:10,573
HAVE TO DO?

157
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:12,308
>> BASICALLY REPUBLICANS HAVE TO

158
00:05:12,308 --> 00:05:14,310
FIRE UP THEIR BASE, NOT HACK OFF

159
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,579
INDEPENDENT VOTERS, PUT UP GREAT

160
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:23,385
CANDIDATES IN THE OTHER RACES

161
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:24,553
LIKE NORTH DAKOTA.

162
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:25,955
WHAT I WOULDN'T SAY TO

163
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:26,922
REPUBLICANS, IF THEY HOLD THE

164
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:28,791
HOUSE AND MAKE GAINS IN THE

165
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,992
SENATE, IT WILL BE BECAUSE OF

166
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:31,794
THE ECONOMIC ECONOMIC BOON.

167
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:33,896
THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL

168
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:34,296
PLAN.

169
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:38,501
THEY MIGHT NEED TO SUPPLEMENT

170
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:39,568
THEIR MESSAGE.

171
00:05:39,568 --> 00:05:41,203
TWO INDEPENDENTS AGREE WITH

172
00:05:41,203 --> 00:00:00,000
REPUBLICANS ON AND THEY FIRE UP
