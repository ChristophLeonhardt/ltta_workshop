1
00:00:00,402 --> 00:00:03,372
QUESTION WAS INSULTING,

2
00:00:03,372 --> 00:00:06,375
RIDICULOUS AND FRANKLY,

3
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:06,808
LUDICROUS.

4
00:00:06,808 --> 00:00:09,811
>> RICH JENSEN, THANKS.

5
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:12,447
PLEASE JOIN ME SUNDAY NIGHT FOR

6
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:14,916
A LOOK AT HOW ANOTHER SUMMIT

7
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,452
THREE DECADES AGO CHANGE THE

8
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:18,286
WORLD.

9
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:19,421
IT COVERS RONALD REAGAN'S

10
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:22,758
EFFORTS TO REACH A AGREEMENT

11
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:25,427
WITH THE SOVIET MIKHAIL

12
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:25,794
GORBACHEV.

13
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:28,397
THAT'S BASED ON MY NEW BOOK,

14
00:00:28,397 --> 00:00:31,266
"THREE DAYS IN MOSCOW."

15
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:31,767
HERE'S A PREVIEW.

16
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:35,871
>> WHEN I CAME IN IN 1982,

17
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:37,672
REAGAN WAS STILL IN FULL

18
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:40,208
THROATED RENUNCIATION OF THE

19
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,209
SOVIET UNION.

20
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:42,544
HE WAS STILL VERY MUCH PLAYING

21
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:45,580
THE COLD WAR ERA.

22
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,382
>> WHAT I'M DESCRIBING NOW IS A

23
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:49,951
PLAN AND HOPE FOR THE LONG-TERM.

24
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:52,454
IT WILL LEAVE AT MARXISM AND

25
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:54,423
LENINISM ON THE ASH HEAP OF

26
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:55,023
HISTORY.

27
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:56,425
FEW EVEN AMONG HIS ALLIES SHARED

28
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:59,394
HIS BELIEF THAT THE COLD WAR WAS

29
00:00:59,394 --> 00:00:59,761
WINNABLE.

30
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:03,865
>> IT WAS A HUGE ARGUMENT IN THE

31
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:04,599
ADMINISTRATION.

32
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,367
PEOPLE IN THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT

33
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:06,635
AND THE CIA BOTH THOUGHT IT WAS

34
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,970
A WASTE OF TIME.

35
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,807
WE ARE HERE, THEY ARE THERE, GET

36
00:01:11,807 --> 00:01:12,874
A LIFE.

37
00:01:12,874 --> 00:01:15,777
>> THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SEEM TO

38
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:17,012
AGREE.

39
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:19,214
NEARLY THREE QUARTERS FAVORED A

40
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:20,449
FREEZE BY THE UNITED STATES AND

41
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:20,882
SOVIET UNION.

42
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:23,552
>> I URGE YOU TO WEAR THAT

43
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:25,787
TEMPTATION OF PRIDE, THE

44
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:26,521
TEMPTATION OF DECLARING

45
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:27,789
OURSELVES ABOVE IT ALL.

46
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,826
>> THAT SPARKED REAGAN'S MOST

47
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:31,793
FORCEFUL CRITICISM EVER OF THE

48
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:32,227
SOVIET UNION.

49
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:33,962
>> TO IGNORE THE FACTS OF

50
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:35,163
HISTORY AND AGGRESSIVE IMPULSES

51
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:37,232
OF AN EVIL EMPIRE AND TO SIMPLY

52
00:01:37,232 --> 00:01:38,867
CALL THE ARMS RACE OF GIANT

53
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:39,634
MISUNDERSTANDING AND TO THEREBY

54
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:41,636
REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE

55
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:42,671
STRUGGLE BETWEEN RIGHT AND

56
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:44,840
WRONG, AND GOOD AND EVIL.

57
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,608
>> I WAS AT THE SPEECH WHERE HE

58
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:47,676
TALKED ABOUT THE EVIL EMPIRE AND

59
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:50,111
THE FOCUS OF EVIL ON THE MODERN

60
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:50,645
WORLD.

61
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:52,814
IT WAS STUNNING, EVEN BY

62
00:01:52,814 --> 00:00:00,000
REAGAN'S STANDARDS, I WAS PRETTY
