today President Trump attack Bob Miller by name which doesn't always happen and also defended Vladimir Putin I'll read it to you Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with meddling in our election I guess take their word for it Trump also stepping up an assault on the Russia probe itself and then they go after us for a Russian a hoax it's a witch-hunt hoax it'sit's isn't it incredible when you talk about a double Senate Bob Muller doesn't respond to this kind of thing but we can't follow his work ABC News reporting he's now eyeing some prominent Russian oligarchs who apparently had VIP access to Trump inauguration events mother also subpoenaing Roger stones former aide Trump's allies in Congress following his lead dramatically today this was a big event a series of attacks on Muller's boss rod Rosenstein yeah they talk about the Muller investigation it's really the Rosen Stein investigation you appointed Muller you're supervising Muller there's an old saying that justice delayed is justice denied I think right now all of us are being denied whatever you got finish it the hell up because this country is being torn apart the judge that heard Mike Flynn's case why'd you try to hide that promise mr. Jordan I appreciate you give me the opportunity respond I've heard you make those sort of allegations publicly on TV it's I got a response mr. chairman he should be very opportunity mr. Jordan sir it's Fur Day I am the Deputy Attorney General United States okay I'm not the person doing the redacting and my job is to make sure that we respond to your concerns we have sir now I've appointed mr. louse who is managing that production and my understanding is it's actually going very well sir so I appreciate your concerns you and I think that house representatives gonna say otherwise but your use of this to attack me provided you son wrong made the witness be permitted it's not personal I'm joined by Nick Ackerman for an Watergate special prosecutor and guy Lewis the federal prosecutor who worked with Muller Comey and the man you saw there rod Rosenstein how do you think mr. Rosen Stein did today that is about as as heated as we ever see him get in a public forum I gotta tell ya I have I have not seen rod get that frustrated frankly you could see the anger on his face if you watch the entire hearing I think he was called at various times a liar a cheat a cover-up I mean clearly I think my best guess is between the President and again remarkably members of his own party which I assume you know nickel tell you even in Watergate errors that didn't happen I mean they've thrown the rulebook out the window they taken off the gloves and and they're going after anybody involved in this investigation Nick I'll play a little more of the exchanges it was very obviously political it was very obviously a partisan attempt to rough up mr. Rosenstein because I think the reasonable inference is not there Rosen signs doing such a terrible job that the work itself would undermine him but rather that he or Muller may be finding something that hurts that hurts the Republican side here was another exchange about the ongoing investigation its Attorney General do you believe as Donald Trump indicated that the investigation of which you have read the Inspector General's report has vindicated mr. Trump as relates to collusion Congress or is the investigation ongoing there is an ongoing investigation yes and it's not concluded correct of course it's not concluded there are so many different avenues to follow here the idea that this investigation is going to be completed overnight is absurd Muller has only been in office a little over a year already a number of people have been indicted organizations have been indicted people have pled guilty this is how you build a case the idea that the Justice Department works on a 24 news news cycle and suddenly comes up with charges immediately is totally contrary to a rule of law the way the Justice Department works the way they put together cases they have to prove their cases beyond a reasonable doubt to do that kind of a case and put that kind of a case together you don't do it overnight you have to put people in a grand jury you've got to take testimony I mean we as we sit here now have no idea where this is all going at this point we don't know where it's going to end but it's not going to happen overnight and what's happening here is an absolute outrage either they're trying to undermine the investigation completely or on top of that they're also trying to pollute the jury pool that's out there that's going to be assembled very shortly to consider the case against Paul Manafort I mean the idea that our own government is trying to pollute that jury pool against the government is totally unprecedented and I don't think it's ever occurred in our history before yeah and guy what did you think I don't know if you saw the outtake there of trey Gowdy kind of leaning back loosen tie long night before the committee hearing and of all the people it's a large committee they can apportion the questions as they wha when I worked in the Senate sometimes there'd be a strategy on that I guess they gave him the justice delayed is justice denied question when he had Benghazi going triple the length of the Malheur probe with far less results to date yeah there's no question really if you youtube trey Gowdy and watch him the guy is an effective cross-examiner he knows how to do it he knows that how to find that that little weakness to open that door just a little bit to go in and once he smells a little blood in the water he knows how to go after it and and and look there is some ammunition in this case whether it's the the FBI agents who were you know frankly sending inappropriate text back and forth on FBI devices sure exactly so there is some ammunition and so they've taken that and they've taken off the gloves and they've started just hitting in the face as hard as they can and you said you took you said YouTube trey Gowdy that's your hot tip today you and you the one you did on the wrapper which I loved and trey gowdy on cross-examination that's my recommendation until I've been your tubing dog videos and apparently I'm using YouTube the wrong way guy Louis with the good ideas for for when you have spare time and Nick Ackerman thank you both gentlemen hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our You Tube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
