00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:09,077
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP REACTING TO

2
00:00:09,078 --> 00:00:12,914
COLUMNIST JAMAL KHASHOGGI WAS

3
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:14,449
KILLED IN A FISTFIGHT.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:19,988
THE EXPLANATION IS WITH

5
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:21,589
WIDESPREAD DEBATE ON HOW THE

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,425
U.S. SHOULD RESPOND.

7
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:26,894
ESPECIALLY SINCE SAUDI ARABIA IS

8
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:30,398
A IMPORTANT MIDDLE EAST ALLY.

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,533
GOVERNOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SITS ON

10
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,636
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS

11
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:37,271
JOINING ME RIGHT NOW.

12
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:38,606
SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING

13
00:00:38,607 --> 00:00:39,040
US.

14
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:39,874
>> THANK YOU.

15
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,645
>> YOUR REACTION TO THE

16
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:44,912
EXPLANATION.

17
00:00:44,913 --> 00:00:46,514
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S CREDIBLE

18
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:48,282
AT ALL.

19
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:50,418
IT'S RIDICULOUS TO BELIEVE 18

20
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:53,855
PEOPLE WOULD GO TO TURKEY TO

21
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:55,390
KILL MR.  KHASHOGGI AND NOBODY

22
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:57,825
IN THE GOVERNMENT KNOW ABOUT IT.

23
00:00:57,826 --> 00:00:59,827
THIS IS ABUSE OF AUTHORITY.

24
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:06,401
HE WAS MURDERED IN A CONFLICT.

25
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:09,337
WE WILL FIND OUT MORE UNLIKE THE

26
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:11,239
PRESIDENT'S MEASURED RESPONSE.

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,175
I LIKE THAT HE CONSULTED WITH

28
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:14,542
CONGRESS.

29
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:17,912
THEY ARE AN ALLY AND THEY NEED

30
00:01:17,913 --> 00:01:21,015
US MORE THAN WE NEED THEM.

31
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:23,084
>> WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT IT

32
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:23,651
SENATOR?

33
00:01:23,652 --> 00:01:25,520
>> I WOULD LIKE TO GO AFTER THE

34
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:27,622
PEOPLE THAT PUT US IN THIS BOX.

35
00:01:27,623 --> 00:01:30,258
THIS IS THE MOST IN YOUR FACE

36
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:33,394
MOVE BY AN MIDDLE EAST ALLY.

37
00:01:33,395 --> 00:01:39,400
TO CHILL A MAN IN A FOREIGN

38
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:39,734
COUNTRY.

39
00:01:39,735 --> 00:01:49,911
I WOULD LIKE TO PUNISH THOSE

40
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:50,278
INVOLVED.

41
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:53,381
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THE

42
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:55,983
CROWN PRINCE WASN'T INVOLVED.

43
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:58,753
I DON'T MIND MILITARY SALES BUT

44
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:00,888
I CONTENT DO BUSINESS WITH THE

45
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:04,092
CURRENT LEADERSHIP.

46
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:06,060
>> INITIALLY YOU SAID YOU WANT

47
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,261
NBS OUT.

48
00:02:07,262 --> 00:02:09,530
YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T TRAVEL TO

49
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:13,801
CINCO DE MAYO DIDN'T I

50
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:13,835
SANCO DE MAYO DIDN'T I

51
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:13,868
SAUDO DE MAYO DIDN'T I

52
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:15,036
SAUDI DE MAYO DIDN'T I

53
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:15,069
SAUDI AE MAYO DIDN'T I

54
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,103
SAUDI ARAMAYO DIDN'T I

55
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:15,136
SAUDI ARABIYO DIDN'T I

56
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:15,236
SAUDI ARABIAO DIDN'T I

57
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:15,269
SAUDI ARABIA UDIDN'T I

58
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,303
SAUDI ARABIA UNTDN'T I

59
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:15,336
SAUDI ARABIA UNTIL'T I

60
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:15,369
SAUDI ARABIA UNTIL T I

61
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,671
SAUDI ARABIA UNTIL THERE IS A

62
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:17,205
CHANGE THERE.

63
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:18,539
THIS MAN TEAMED UP WITH THE

64
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,943
UNITED STATES TO HAVE A UNIFIED

65
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:22,243
FRONT.

66
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:23,778
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THEM YOU

67
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:25,546
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IRAN.

68
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:28,282
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

69
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:30,518
>> SAUDI ARABIA IS THE NATIONAL

70
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:31,753
ENEMY OF IRAN.

71
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:33,488
THEY TALK ABOUT REFORMING THE

72
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:35,490
COUNTRY IN THE WAY ALIKE.

73
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:41,562
I NEVER FELT MORE USED.

74
00:02:41,563 --> 00:02:47,235
HE EMBARGOED THE COUNTRY.

75
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:55,409
I BELIEVE HE IS RESPONSIBLE.

76
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,145
THIS IS WAY OUTSIDE THE

77
00:02:57,146 --> 00:02:58,546
CIVILIZED NORMS.

78
00:02:58,547 --> 00:02:59,747
I'LL NEVER GO BACK.

79
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:01,883
YOU WILL NEVER CONVINCE ME HE

80
00:03:01,884 --> 00:03:05,086
DIDN'T DO THIS AND OUR VALUES

81
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:06,087
SHOULD MEAN SOMETHING.

82
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:07,755
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

83
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:14,929
THE PRESIDENT TO FIND A SOLUTION

84
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,697
WITH THIS.

85
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,866
>> ARE WE SURPRISED THIS

86
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:21,202
BRUTALITY CAME OUT OF SAUDI

87
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:21,602
ARABIA.

88
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:25,173
THIS COUNTRY HAD 15 OUT OF THE

89
00:03:25,174 --> 00:03:27,942
19 HIJACKERS?

90
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:29,677
>> YEAH, I'M SURPRISED.

91
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:32,113
I'M SURPRISED A COUNTRY THAT

92
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:36,017
CALLS HIMSELF AN ALLY OF THE

93
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:36,951
UNITED STATES.

94
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:39,287
IT SHOWS COMPLETE CONTENT FOR

95
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:43,858
OUR VALUE OR THIS IS NOT

96
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:45,793
INFORMING SAUDI ARABIA.

97
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:49,697
THEY WILL CUT UP SAUDI ARABIA AS

98
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:51,632
AN ALLY.

99
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,934
THIS BEHAVIOR IS OUTSIDE THE

100
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:54,368
NORM TO THE POINT THAT THE

101
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:56,571
PEOPLE INVOLVED NEED TO BE

102
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:58,206
REMOVED IN MY VIEW.

103
00:03:58,207 --> 00:04:01,042
SAUDI ARABIA IS A COUNTRY AND

104
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:02,343
MBS IS A PERSON.

105
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:04,378
I'M WILLING TO SEPARATE THE TWO.

106
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,614
I WOULDN'T ACCEPT THIS.

107
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:08,516
IF WE ACCEPT THIS EVERY OTHER

108
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:10,852
PERSON WHO COULD DO THIS WILL.

109
00:04:10,853 --> 00:04:13,087
NEXT THING YOU KNOW OUR ENEMIES

110
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:18,192
WILL LOSE RESPECT FOR US.

111
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,960
>> BOTTOM LINE HERE, THERE IS AN

112
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:23,798
ARMS DEAL ON THE TABLE.

113
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,600
$100 BILLION WORTH OF ARMED

114
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,000
SALES.

115
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:27,635
SHOULD THE U.S. GO THROUGH WITH

116
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:28,536
THAT?

117
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:29,871
>> I'M OKAY GOING THROUGH THE

118
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:32,006
DEAL IF THEY SHOW THEY ARE GOING

119
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:34,108
TO CHANGE.

120
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:36,544
THE PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE IN A

121
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:38,246
FASHION CONSISTENT WITH WHAT

122
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:39,180
HAPPENED HERE.

123
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:41,682
I'M NOT DOING BUSINESS UNLESS

124
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:42,216
THEY CHANGE.

125
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:45,753
MY BEEF IS NOT WITH SAUDI ARABIA

126
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:47,855
THE COUNTRY BUT THE LEADER

127
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:50,091
TAKING THE LAW IN HIS OWN HANDS

128
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:52,326
SHOWING NOTHING BUT CONTENT IN

129
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:57,765
HIS RELATIONSHIP AND ACTING IN A

130
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:58,866
BARBARIC FASHION.

131
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:02,003
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ARM

132
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:05,473
SALES WITH REGARD TO RUSSIA.

133
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:09,277
THE U.S. WILL WITHDRAW FROM THE

134
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:10,511
TREATY WITH RUSSIA.

135
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:13,014
YOUR THOUGHTS, RIGHT MOVE?

136
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:14,248
>> ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT MOVE.

137
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:15,883
THEY HAVE BEEN COMMITTING.

138
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:18,719
THE CHINESE ARE BUILDING UP

139
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,021
THEIR MISSILES.

140
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:21,355
I LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP BEING

141
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:21,656
TOUGH.

142
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:23,925
HE WALKED AWAY FROM THE IRAN

143
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:26,494
DEAL BECAUSE IT WAS A JOKE OF A

144
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:27,695
DEAL.

145
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:30,264
OBAMA TRIED TO IGNORE THE

146
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:30,631
IRANIANS.

147
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:32,466
I DON'T WANT TO IGNORE AND

148
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:35,503
APIECE THE SAUDIS.

149
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:39,941
THE MIDDLE EAST NEEDS TO BE

150
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:40,274
CHANGED.

151
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:45,913
THE RUSSIANS NEVER HONORED THEIR

152
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:46,314
BARGAIN.

153
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:48,449
>> THERE IS THE OTHER NUCLEAR

154
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,717
POWER WHICH IS NORTH KOREA.

155
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:51,786
WHAT DO WE KNOW HERE IN TERMS OF

156
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:56,123
THE PRESIDENT'S UPCOMING MEETING

157
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:59,160
IN CHINA AT THE G 20.

158
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:01,495
CHINA IS CRITICAL TO THAT

159
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:01,929
RELATIONSHIP.

160
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,932
WHAT CAN YOU DELL US ABOUT THAT

161
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:06,100
RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW?

162
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:08,102
>> WE WOULDN'T BE TALKING TO

163
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:10,604
NORTH KOREA IF IT WASN'T BECAUSE

164
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:13,441
OF DONALD TRUMP'S STRAIGHT.

165
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,977
HE COULD THEM WE WON'T LET YOU

166
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:17,378
BUILD A WEAPON TO HIT AMERICA.

167
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,513
WE HAVE A DIALOG WITH NORTH

168
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:21,115
KOREA THAT'S HOPEFUL.

169
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:23,050
IT'S DUE TO THE PRESIDENT BEING

170
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:23,451
STRONG.

171
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:30,091
THEY BELIEVE PRESIDENT TRUMP

172
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,426
WILL USE HIS MILITARY FORCE.

173
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:34,362
CHINA NEEDS TO HELP US.

174
00:06:34,363 --> 00:06:37,798
I'M PLEASED WITH WHAT TRUMP HAS

175
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:42,837
DONE.

176
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:43,971
>>Reporter: CHINA HAS ALSO

177
00:06:43,972 --> 00:06:48,342
BEEN HELPFUL THERE.

178
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:50,344
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE IN TERMS OF

179
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:52,546
THIS FIGHT WITH CHINA.

180
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:55,416
THIS CAN GO ON FOR A LONG TIME.

181
00:06:55,417 --> 00:07:07,995
YOU ARE DEALING WITH A DICTATOR.

182
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:15,469
CHINA STEALS INTELLECTUAL

183
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,204
PROPERTY THEY STEAL YOUR

184
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:18,506
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

185
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:20,641
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO PUSH BACK AND

186
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:21,942
TRUMP IS DOING IT.

187
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:24,378
I DON'T LIKE TARIFFS BUT THEY

188
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:27,715
ARE A TOOL TO GET CHINA TO

189
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:28,049
CHANGE.

190
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:47,968
THEIR ECONOMY IS WEAKER THAN

224
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:27,668
THEY CREATE ISLANDS AND PUT

225
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,470
MILITARY BASES ON THEM.

ECONOMY.

234
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:53,527
WE NEED TO WRITE RULES THAT

00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:56,197
RECOGNIZE CHINA IS A DEVELOPED

236
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:58,299

237
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,632

00:09:58,633 --> 00:09:59,833
MIKE PENCE IS RIGHT.

00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,807
THEN WHEN WE IGNORE THE PROBLEM.

I HAD EIGHT YEARS OF IGNORING

243
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:12,046

WE NEED A BETTER DEAL.

310
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,542

312
00:12:23,044 --> 00:12:26,680

EPISODE IN THE HISTORY OF THE

00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:50,056
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

381
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,992

THE MORE WE CAN GET IT DONE.

WE DID A LOT WITH 51.
