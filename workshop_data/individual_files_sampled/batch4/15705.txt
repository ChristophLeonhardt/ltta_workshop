big win last night in Singapore not just for president Donald Trump but for the United States and the entire world I could not be prouder today of our president Donald Trump prouder to be an American and prouder to live in an America that again leads from the front of course I'm talking about the historic summit in Singapore that took place last night this morning Singapore last night our time here on the East Coast at 9:00 p.m. out of which came an agreement where North Korea agrees to completely D nuclearized now I'm not saying I trust North Korea but the mere fact that Donald Trump in the United States of America got North Korea to the table shaking hands Trump by the way is to be commended yes I believe he deserves a Nobel Prize Lee you guys know I'm a fan the president but I've never been here leader of the president when he's wrong I call him out there are people in his administration that I still think and then have thought couldn't be there in his son-in-law his daughter I never liked that idea there are some other people that I would have liked to have never seen been in the administration Reince Priebus Katie Walsh is a prior chief of staff and deputy chief of staff but there is no debating the fact that Donald Trump knows how to make a deal and there's no debating the fact that he is completely completely dismantling Barack Obama and the Republican neocons the Democrats globalist agenda there is no doubt but let's look at the the pre meeting if you will much has been in the media about the meeting itself at the details of the denuclearization deal are pretty scant right now we don't have many details we know that there are certain concessions the most important of which of course is that North Korea is going to dien ook others are that we're going to get the remains of 6,000 service people from the Korean War that's a big deal for those families a very big deal for the children and the grandchildren of those who fort fought in that war on many of them are you know alive many of those families their children it be in their 60s and 70s their grandchildren in their 20s 30s and 40s but these are relatively young families that will now get some closure of Burgesses relative which i think is a spectacular spectacular thing I told you to show many times there is no more powerful weapon on this planet I don't care about how many kilotons and new kids couldn't care less there is no more powerful weapon on this planet you destroy communism dictatorships the Tollett Aryan is of no greater weapon than capitalism none so of course the left-wing media's hysterical about the way Donald Trump handled the meeting let's first go to the pre meeting rump Pompeyo and National Security Advisor John Bolton pulled off Bolton pulled off a work of art I'm suspecting although she was less visible for obvious reasons the new CIA director Jena hospital had a lot to do with this as well not to mention secretary James Madison the Department of Defense many many people general Kelly the chief of staff had input here tremendous input into this president he's his chief of staff but is also marine four-star general who has tremendous experience around the world now rump commanded this meeting from day one first by sending secretaries taking Mike Pompeo to meet with Kim twice and under Lee I am the biggest fan of Secretary's day Pompeo though I don't say underling in a demeaning way whatsoever I think he might go down in history as one of the greatest secretaries of state this man has accomplished more in months than its predecessors of many administrations having decades so I but but he's clearly in the chain of command but boarding it to the president and so that sent a message to Kim that the president was gonna send the nemah Cerie twice the filled things out then the minute Kim stepped that align the president walked from the summit him then sent an emissary with a big card to the White House summit was back on the summit took place as scheduled something I've actually been predicting at a better than 50% chance now yesterday I predicted that we'd come out of this with a win I don't know it was gonna be this big of a win but I'd predicted we'd come out of it with a win because I suspect that the groundwork was already laid I think Donald Trump was going into this blind I think a lot of the work was done by secretary Pompeo and through the intermediaries fact that Trump handled it that way the fact that he handled it that way showed us something else it showed us that the United States controlled this from start to finish the United States was in complete control here complete command and control even the way Trump exited the meeting for a couple of days it forced North Korea take a submissive posture and go back to the White House with that letter then we get to the meeting itself in Singapore if you look at the nuances of the body language Rumph escorting Kim and Trump commanding the room when they shook hands and looked at the camera Trump giving him a nod it's okay now you can talk to the cameras he controlled it those little subtle cues Kim was looking to Trump to figure out when it was time to do the next thing there was already there was already a superior subordinate relationship there with the United States in the position it should have been a period superior not the Bourdon it like barack obama was with cuba those embarrassing embarrassing photographs of raul castro holding obama's limp wrists over his head in contrast the trump 6-4-3 six-foot-four standing there shaking kim's hand firmly looking down at kim that's what the united states need I'm not saying height that's something you're born with Obama was much taller than Raul Castro you got a foot taller than Raul Castro Raul Castro still made Obama look weak beckalus a weak Billy it was such an embarrassing visual for the United States of America the Trump goes into this meeting and he gets out of the meeting what he expected to get going in front never sold despite with the left-wing media tells you Trump never sold the American people on anything remotely resembling him having come out of that meeting with North Korea demolishing all its nuclear sites while they were in the meeting here we said we're gonna get to an agreement where they'll denuclearize which we did we're gonna create an inspection framework never gonna move forward and we're gonna get some other things as well the left was hysterical people like Jim Acosta saying well Trump gave himself all kinds of outs if it doesn't work these people are so unpatriotic so unpatriotic it's sickening then the left-wing media was hysterical because what came out of this was that Trump showed Kim a North Korean coastline on an iPad and he said what beautiful beaches wouldn't it be great if he had hotels and resorts so of course the left that oh this is all about personal enrichment for Trump a so wat and beards brilliant I don't care if it's Marriott Ritz Carlton Hyatt Hilton or the Trump organization that builds hotels there capitalism creeping in is only a good thing only a good thing the left is hysterical for no reason it was brilliant a stroke of brilliance for Donald Trump to show Kim a developed coastline Kim is infatuated with the West he's infatuated with wealth it was one of the one of me one of the best one of the best exercises in asymmetrical diplomacy I've ever seen really important stuff I want to stay on this North Korea story for you help me do that by subscribing to our premium service at www.mptv.org
