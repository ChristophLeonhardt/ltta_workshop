democratic and constitutional politics

fact that he you know he did everything

174
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:42,199
he could to try and stop him that he

175
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,969
made in my opinion a complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> and utter</font>

176
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,800
fool of himself but that he didn't do

177
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,199
anything as bad as choosing this

178
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,479
bureaucratic slavery and that's what it

179
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,089
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a completely unamerican</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care what Trump's flaws are so</font>

182
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:58,550
let's take a look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm because</font>

183
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,900
there's still a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions it's a</font>

184
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,460
little bit of mysterious you remember

185
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,719
obviously everyone knows at this point

186
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:04,969
michael Flynn the<font color="#CCCCCC"> national security</font>

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">pants apparently about conversations he</font>

189
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,379
had had with the Russian ambassador

190
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,939
about sanctions that Obama had put on

191
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:17,180
Russia after Russia hacked into our

192
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,099
election system and tried to basically

193
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:21,409
skew the election so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big question</font>

194
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,110
that the media the media is spinnin this

195
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia's taken over our government</font>

196
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,050
and the big question they're asking is

197
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,969
why it<font color="#E5E5E5"> took so long so yesterday Sean</font>

what was going on so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the first</font>

205
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,430
yeah the number five we've been

206
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,800
reviewing and evaluating this issue with

basis for a few weeks trying to

209
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">ascertain the truth we got to a point</font>

210
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,020
not based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a legal issue well based on</font>

211
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,120
a trust issue where the level of trust

212
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,340
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the president and general Flynn</font>

213
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,650
had eroded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where he felt he</font>

214
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,750
had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a change the president was</font>

215
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,759
very concerned that general Flynn had

216
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,520
misled the Vice President<font color="#CCCCCC"> and others he</font>

217
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,289
was also very<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned in light of</font>

218
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:14,270
sensitive subjects dealt with by that

219

position of national security<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisers</font>

220
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,229
like China North Korea in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Middle</font>

complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> and unwavering trust for the</font>

223
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,759
person in that position the evolving and

224
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,800
eroding level of trust as a result of

<font color="#E5E5E5">this situation in a series of other</font>

226
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,208
questionable instances is what led the

<font color="#E5E5E5">president to ask for general Flynn's</font>

228
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,059
resignation so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one thing</font>

229
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kept asking everybody kept asking</font>

230
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,899
the Kellyanne Conway yesterday why did

231
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:44,059
it take so long they they warned you

232
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:47,660
that Flynn would be subject of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> nura</font>

233
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">below Russian blackmail why didn't call</font>

234
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,529
the person who warned them was the

235
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,270
acting Attorney General Sally Yates who

236
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,279
you will remember he had to fire when

237
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,640
she refused<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enforce his travel ban so</font>

238
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,620
Sally Yates was an Obama operative who

239
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,520
never should have been there in the

240
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,170
first place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust her</font>

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,930
take her advice means nothing to me but

242
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,880
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to spend this now</font>

260
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,670
were discovering evidence that Russia

261
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,380
was trying to disrupt the presidential

then sought to learn whether the Trump

campaign was colluding with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russians</font>

267
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,760
on the hacking the officials interviewed

268

in recent weeks said that so far they

269
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:57,889
have seen

270
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,449
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence of such cooperation so</font>

271
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:01,369
they're talking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Russians Trump</font>

272
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:02,600
had a lot of business dealings with

273

Russian Russia and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially</font>

274
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:08,779
singled out Paul man afford who has had

275
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,369
contact with Russia<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I consider</font>

276
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:12,949
unsavory but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were illegal I mean</font>

277
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:14,299
they were completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal right and</font>

278
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:16,489
they so they said one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the guys was</font>

279
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:18,049
Paul Manafort and they didn't name the

280
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:19,399
other people so of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> manna for</font>

284
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,399
mana<font color="#E5E5E5"> fort's response was this is absurd</font>

285
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,379
I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> referring to</font>

286
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,089
I've never knowingly spoken to Russian

287
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,619
intelligence officers and I've never

288
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:35,089
been involved with anything to do with

289
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:36,619
the Russian government or the Putin

290
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,059
administration or any other issues under

291
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:40,609
investigation today the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

292
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:43,519
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to businessmen in in Russia</font>

293
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,989
the businessmen and the intelligence

294
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:47,029
officers you cannot tell them apart this

295
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,399
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a nothing burger story okay</font>

296
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,739
it's a nothing burger story and and by

297
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:54,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you know spice are also dealt</font>

298
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,929
with this there was no illegality

299
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:59,329
involved with<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Flynn did there's no</font>

300
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,309
reason why this administration even

301
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,230
before they come into<font color="#CCCCCC"> office can't call</font>

302
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,239
up another government even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you don't</font>

303
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:07,129
happen to like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government and say</font>

304
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:09,799
you know we don't like the sanctions

305
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,139
that were imposed on you or you know did

306
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,059
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold your fire until we get into</font>

307
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:16,309
office or whatever nothing illegal about

308
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,230
this they can do I mean they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

309
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Logan act as I said no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one's ever</font>

310
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:21,769
been prosecuted no one ever could be

311
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:23,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">prosecuted on it as far as I'm concerned</font>

312
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,739
because it violates the First Amendment

313
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:27,919
so okay let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take a look you</font>

314
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,459
remember in 2012 when Obama famously

315
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,139
left the mic open when he's talking to

316
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:35,869
the outgoing President Medvedev<font color="#CCCCCC"> Medved</font>

317
