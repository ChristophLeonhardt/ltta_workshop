So, one of the first
things I noticed
about the sound of the
gunfire was that the burst
was uninterrupted.
It was this kind of stream, like
a steady rhythm, which kind of
immediately jumped out to me as
being a little extraordinary.
Just in past mass shootings --
semi-automatic weapons
have been used primarily.
My name is Thomas Gibbons-Neff.
I'm a reporter for
the New York Times,
and I served in the Marine
Corps for four years
as an infantryman.
It was definitely
shooting fully automatic.
But at the same time,
it seemed to hiccup
in places, which could suggest
that the weapon was originally
built to fire semi-automatic.
And we don't know if
it's been modified.
Basically, it's an
uninterrupted chain of fire.
So say with a
semi-automatic weapon, where
you'd have to pull the trigger
once to fire one round,
this is fully automatic.
So the shooter can
depress the trigger
and hold and fire
as many bullets
as he can until he
runs out of ammo.
In certain videos, you
can hear lower thuds.
"What is that noise?"
"You guys, I don't know."
Or in some places,
it's a higher snap.
The higher snap is
actually the round --
the bullets passing
through the air --
while the lower thud is the
actual report of the rifle.
For those in that crowd, with
the shooter 500 yards away,
they would hear the rounds
snapping by their heads
or snapping through the
air, hitting the ground.
Before they heard the
report of the rifles.
Depending on how many tall
buildings were around,
it would make
finding and locating
the shooter more difficult,
because the sound refracts.
But in this case, the shooter
firing so many rounds,
it'd be relatively
easy to at least know
the general direction of where
the fire was coming from.
