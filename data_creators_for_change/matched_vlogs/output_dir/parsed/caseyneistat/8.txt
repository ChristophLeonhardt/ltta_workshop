so only on the stage because Sean case
you're both here
today is the day today is today is the
biggest day in my career in a long time
it's definitely the biggest day for
three six eight ever today's gonna be a
great day
I'm crazy in here
this is 3 6 8 looks a little different
right it looks like this because tonight
is the premiere of the Shawn Mendes
movie that Shawn and I made early this
summer my friend Zach and my friend
Brett and and we have like we have like
a hundred and fifty people coming here I
think a hundred of them are fans we
actually we did it we invited all the
fans did a hundred fans here but a
hundred and fifty people coming here
tonight to watch the movie
and then here's why this is a big deal
beyond just the event at 360 see movies
like like this
Shawn documentary I know it's only 15
minutes and I know I made it for his
channel but this is like a an actual
movie where I had an actual crew I had
Bret I had exact it was the three of us
we were focused we had like real audio
and real cameras it looks beautiful and
that kind of filmmaking was the
filmmaking that defined my whole career
before I started YouTube before I
started vlogging so beyond all of the
excitement that's like physically
happening today
the fact that the movie is now out the
fact that you can click the link below
go to Shawn's channel and see this movie
the a YouTube video these take me a day
I have one day to make these videos in
that 14 minute 15 minute movie took like
me with two of the most capable
filmmakers in the world
Zach and Brett took us almost four
months to finish so it just feels it
just feels to be massive
Levi you've seen it it's amazing so good
you don't have to say that you can if
you don't like it I almost cried he
really almost like Shawn Mendes
well this is China Vash so right now the
New York City Fire Department am i
wearing two pairs of sunglasses the New
York City Fire Department's here I think
we're on the up and up but we're at
alike stop everything so we can double
check everything with and doors are
supposed to open in an hour
right now I'm working with Levi because
I think we're gonna shoot like a little
behind-the-scenes a little interview
between he and I between Sean and I when
he gets here you know shoot there Levi
you know you got a dress this set a
little bit right yeah that's how we do
you know move my podcasting table right
when does he get here in like I mean
we've done like our Taco Tuesday we've
done a couple of small creator get
together it's like our gaming event but
nothing of this scale or magnitude and
tonight really represents the ambition
of the space
Sean's a musician but we're we're also
bringing our bunch of creators a bunch
of fans a bunch of people from the
industry and three six eight is kind of
the nucleus that everything revolves
around all right this is it t - how many
minutes 2015 15 minutes before things
begin
doors open in five
okay so on a scale of one to nervous
would you say that this movie premiere
is the single most like biggest just
greatest this is this is the most
authentic video Story movie on me that
will ever be released do you really I
mean that really yeah I really do
that's true I appreciate you saying that
Shawn okay we ready Levi we're gonna
shoot a Q&A now you ready
welcome to the world premiere of our
artist spotlight story with neither
shaman so I'm gonna be on the stage with
Michonne because you're both here
do you guys know this came together
you know now I think you have had not
many people understand maybe as much as
you do when I tell you how much the
connection between us actually means and
you really do seem to understand and
that was I really mean this was not my
heart one of the most questioned things
I've ever done with you guys so
and could YouTube for putting aside this
is just above
Kord it's going oh I got the big camera
Casey now you're in trouble I'm going
places with this man how do I get this
off this stupid stand
guys here's to know what's the kill her
yeah did you have something to do with
this
not nothing did you have something to do
with this okay thank the Academy

just basically juice the algorithm to
get me all my views and I'd like to of
course thank Shawn Mendes because
without my shirt without putting your
face in my thumbnails I would have never
