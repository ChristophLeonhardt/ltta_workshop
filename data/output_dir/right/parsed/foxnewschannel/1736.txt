>> GAZA BORDER AN AWFUL SCENE
UNFOLDING.
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
PALESTINIANS, SOME WAVING THEIR
FLAGS, THE FLAGS OF A PEOPLE
WITHOUT A COUNTRY, A HUMAN TIDE
OF PROTEST.
>> THE PROTESTERS, INCLUDING SIX
CHILDREN WHO WERE REPORTEDLY
KILLED TODAY SEEMED TO BE LOSING
THEIR LIVES FOR NOTHING.
>> ALL OF THOSE BABIES ARE DEAD.
ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE DEAD.
THEY'RE DEAD.
BRIAN: RIGHT.
60 HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES.
OVER, JUST UNDER 130 SERIOUSLY
WOUNDED AFTER THEY STORMED THE
BORDER ON THE GAZA-ISRAEL
DIVIDE.
BEN SHAPIRO JOINS US NOW,
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF THE DAILY
WIRE, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST.
HOST OF THE BEN SHAPIRO PODCAST.
BEN, DO YOU FEEL THE COVERAGE IS
BALANCED LIKE WE JUST SHOWED
YOU?
>> NO.
I THINK THAT THERE IS SO MANY
MEDIA OUTLETS ACTING AS
PROPOGANDA ARMS FOR MA'AM HAS IT
IS INCREDIBLE.
THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR WEEKS
THEY WANT TO SEND LITERALLY
100,000 PEOPLE TO STORM THE
BORDER WITH ISRAEL.
HAMAS IS OBVIOUS.
WE WANT TO BREAK IN, KILL
ISRAELIS.
THEY'RE NOT HIDING THE BALL
HERE.
THE MEDIA ARE HIDING THE BALL.
THE MEDIA ARE PLAYING PROPAGANDA
WING FOR A TERRORIST GROUP WHICH
MADE CLEAR THEIR INTENT.
PEOPLE STORMING THE BORDER
ATTEMPTING TO KILL ISRAELI
SOLDIERS, SENDING KITES WITH
INCENDIARY DEVICES.
SLEEPING STONES AT PEOPLE OVER
THE BORDER.
THAT ISRAELIS ARE INDISCRIMINATE
FASHION KILLING PEOPLE BUT THAT
IS LIE.
THE MEDIA HAS BEEN DOING THAT
FOR YEARS.
STEVE: PEOPLE IN THE SOUND BITE
MONTAGE THERE, WOULD PREFER THE
ISRAELI DOES?
>> THE ANSWER IS THEY WOULD
PREFER THE ISRAELIS STOP
EXISTING.
THESE ARE TWO THE CHOICES.
NOT THAT HAMAS IS NOT IN CONTROL
OF GAZA STRIP.
ONE.
PEOPLE SAY IN THE MONTAGE,
PEOPLE WITHOUT A STATE.
ISRAEL WITH DREW FROM THE GAZA
STRIP IN 2005.
THE GAZA STRIP HAS BEEN ENTIRELY
UNDER CONTROL OF THE HAMAS IN
2006.
HAMAS IS STATE DEPARTMENT
ONE.
WORST TERRORIST GROUPS ON
PLANET.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BELIEVE
THIS IS ISRAEL'S FAULT HAMAS IS
TRYING TO STORM THE BORDER?
IT IS BEYOND ALL DEFINITION.
THE ATTEMPT TO LINK IT BY THE
WAY WITH THE JERUSALEM EMBASSY
IS OPEN SOMETHING JUST INSANE.
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR
WEEKS.
JUST THE MEDIA HADN'T WANTED TO
COVER IT.
THEY PREFER TO BLAME PRESIDENT
TRUMP FOR HAMAS TRUMPED UP
VIOLENCE THAN TO LAY THE BLAME
AT FEET OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
CREATING IT.
AINSLEY: WHAT ARE THE LEADERS OF
HAMAS TELLING THOSE PEOPLE TO
DO?
>> THEY'RE TELLING THEM TO STORM
THE BORDER,
LEFT-WING OUTLET REPORTED
LEADERS OF HAMAS WERE TELLING
PEOPLE ISRAELIS WITHDRAWN FROM
THE BORDER THAT ISRAELI SOLDIERS
WERE NO LONGER MANNING THE
BORDER, IF THEY RAN UP TO
ATTEMPT TO BREACH THE BORDER
THEY WOULD BE FINE.
THEY'RE LYING TO THEIR OWN
PEOPLE.
USING THEM AS HUMAN SHIELDS.
PEOPLE KILLED WERE OPEN HAMAS
OPERATIVES.
THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE.
THIS IS WHAT TERRORISTS GROUP
DO.
TERRORISTS GROUPS ATTACKING THE
BORDER IS STILL A TERRORIST
GROUP.
AINSLEY: WHAT ABOUT WOMEN AND
CHILDREN.
>> THEY'RE USING CHILDREN AS
HUMAN SHIELDS THIS IS WHAT HAMAS
WAS.
DURING THE LAST GAZA WAR, HAMAS
HID THE HEADQUARTERS INSIDE OF A
HOSPITAL.
THIS IS WHAT TERRORIST GROUPS
DO.
WHEN TERRORIST GROUPS GET A
CIVILIAN KILLED THEY ARE HAPPY.
THE MEDIA COVERAGE THAT
CIVILIANS ARE KILLED.
THE ISRAELIS ARE DEEPLY
DEVASTATED BIT.
GOLD TODAY MEIER, WE CAN FORGIVE
THEM KILLING OUR CHILDREN.
BUT WE CAN NEVER BE FORGIVEN FOR
KILLING THEIRS.
STEVE: MOVE TO SEATTLE
WASHINGTON.
APPARENTLY 5-4 VOTE CITY COUNCIL
THERE APPROVED SO-CALLED JOB
HEAD TAX.
FOR EVERY HEAD PERSON THAT
ACCOMPANIED EMPLOYS, IF YOUR
COMPANY IS MAKING OVER
$20 MILLION PROFIT IN A YEAR
THEY WILL LEVY A 275-DOLLAR PER
HEAD TAX.
AMAZON, WHICH, IS THE BIGGEST
EMPLOYER BY FAR OUT THERE.
THEY'RE FURIOUS.
THEY SAY, THEY PUT OUT A
STATEMENT, THEY SAY THE CITY
DOES NOT HAVE A REVENUE PROBLEM.
IT HAS SPENDING EFFICIENCY
PROBLEM.
IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S
TRUE.
>> YEAH.
IT IS NOT JUST A SPENDING
EFFICIENCY PROBLEM.
THEY HAVE A MASSIVE REGULATORY
PROBLEM.
WHAT THEY'RE USING THE HEAD TAX
MONEY FOR, THIS IS PROBLEM FOR
SEATTLE LITERALLY YEARS AT THIS
POINT, SUPPOSEDLY CURE THE
HOMELESS PROBLEM.
THEY'RE SUGGESTING BECAUSE
AMAZON BROUGHT IN LOT OF
EMPLOYEES, DRIVING HOME PRICES
UP, RENTAL PRICES UP WHICH IS
TRUE, BUT THE REASON PRICES ARE
GOING UP THERE, IS NO NEW
ADDITIONAL SUPPLY FOR HOUSING
BECAUSE SEATTLE HEAVILY
REGULATES DEVELOPERS FROM
BUILDING NEW UNITS.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SEATTLE IS
NOT A PROBLEM.
THEY HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN
SEATTLE ABUSED BY PEOPLE FOR
YEARS GOING BACK TO, I BELIEVE
THEY WERE CALLED DRUNK DORMS IN
SEATTLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE ACTUALLY LIVING IN THESE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.
THE PRICES CONTINUE TO GO UP.
HOMELESSNESS WILL CONTINUE TO
INCREASE.
GUESS WHERE HOMELESSNESS REALLY
INCREASE BECAUSE WHEN AMAZON
LEAVES.
PLENTY OF STATES WILL BE HAPPY
TO HAVE THEM WITHOUT LEVERAGING
A $75 MILLION A YEAR TAX.
AINSLEY: VICE PRESIDENT OF THE
COMPANY IS THINKING ABOUT THAT.
MAKING THEM SECOND-GUESS THE
DECISION.
BRIAN: WHEN I THINK OF BEN
SHAPIRO I THINK OF SITCOMS, WHAT
HE LIKES TO WATCH.
YOU HAVE A OPPORTUNITY COUPLE
YEARS IN HIBERNATION, LAST MAN
STANDING COMING ON FOX.
HERE IS A LITTLE TEASE WHAT IT
WILL BE LIKE.
>> TELL ME THAT IS A CAT.
♪♪
WHAT THAT'S?
>> GOT THE TATTOO, CAME HOME
FROM THE PROM PREGNANT.
>> SHE HAS A TATTOO?
OH.
>> ABC KICKED THEM TO THE CURB.
NO MORE.
FOX IS BRINGING THEM BACK.
AFTER THEY SAW HOW SUCCESSFUL
ROSEANNE WAS.
>> NO QUESTION, CERTAINLY
ACCORDING TO EXECUTIVES ONE OF
THE DECIDING FACTORS WHICH MAKE
AS LOT OF SENSE.
"ROSEANNE" HAD A ENORMOUS BURST
OUT OF THE GATE.
PEOPLE LOOKING AT PRESIDENT
TRUMP, SOMEBODY ON TV WHO VOTED
FOR THE PRESIDENT TRUMP.
"LAST MAN STANDING" WAS ONE OF
THE FEW CONSERVE TOUGH SHOWS
THEN IT WENT AWAY.
IT MIGHT BE SMART FOR FOX TO
APPEAL TO OTHER HALF OF THE
COUNTRY.
BRIAN: IT IS NUMBER TWO COMEDY
IN THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY
MYSTERIOUSLY CANCELED IT.
>> IT IS NUMBER TWO, ARE THEY
CANCELING IT BECAUSE HE IS A
CONSERVATIVE.
>> NO QUESTION THERE IS MASSIVE
BIAS INSIDE HOLLYWOOD.
I WROTE ENTIRE BOOK WHERE I
INTERVIEWED, PEOPLE IN
HOLLYWOOD, WRITERS, ACTORS,
DIRECTORS, PRODUCERS, WHY THERE
IS SO LITTLE CONSERVATISM IN
HOLLYWOOD, MANY ADMITTED ON TAPE
THERE IS OPEN DISCRIMINATION OF
HOLLYWOOD AGAINST CONSERVATIVES.
THOUSANDS AN THOUSANDS OF
CONSERVATIVES WHO HIDE
UNDERGROUND THEY ARE AFRAID THEY
WILL BE FIRED AS FOUND OUT AS
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR
HILLARY CLINTON.
AINSLEY: TIM ALLEN SAID, BASES
ARE LOADED, MAN IS AT HOME PLATE
ABOUT TO BAT, SOMETHING LIKE
THIS, AND HE SAID, AND THEN THEY
CANCELED THE GAME.
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO US.
OUR RATINGS WERE SO GOOD.
AM I EXCITED?
HE SAID, H-E-L-L HOCKEY STICKS.
