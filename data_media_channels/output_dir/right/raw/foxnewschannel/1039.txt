00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:10,336
ABBY:

2
00:00:10,336 --> 00:00:10,769
WELCOME BACK.

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:11,503
THE PRESIDENT EXPECTED TO TOUCH

4
00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:12,204
DOWN IN SINGAPORE WITHIN THE

5
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:12,504
HOUR.

6
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:13,806
AND HIS WEEKEND ABROAD APPEARS

7
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,407
TO BE SENDING THE MEDIA INTO A

8
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:16,842
BIT OF A MELTDOWN.

9
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:18,677
HERE TO BREAK IT ALL DOWN,

10
00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:19,678
DISTRICT MEDIA GROUP PRESIDENT

11
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:21,680
AND HERITAGE FOUNDATION

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,516
PRESIDENT BEVERLY HALBURG.

13
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:25,517
GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON WITH US.

14
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:26,485
>> THANK YOU.

15
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,920
ABBY: ALL RIGHT, OF COURSE HE

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,788
HAD LEFT THE G7 SUMMIT BEFORE HE

17
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:31,190
LANDS THERE IN SINGAPORE, WANT

18
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,192
TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON SOME

19
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:34,460
IMAGES THAT HAVE GONE VIRAL.

20
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,662
FIRST, THE IMAGE OF TRUMP AND

21
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,297
EMMANUEL MACRON IN THIS

22
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:38,664
HANDSHAKE.

23
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,165
THERE WERE A LOT OF THOUGHTS

24
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,667
ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE, A

25
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:42,434
FIRM GRIP.

26
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:43,869
HERE'S ONE TWEET FROM THE

27
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:48,474
MANAGING EDITOR AT POLITICO'S

28
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:51,543
USA: MACRON OWNS TRUMP WITH G7

29
00:00:51,543 --> 00:00:52,544
DEATH GRIP HANDSHAKE.

30
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:52,978
YOUR RESPONSE.

31
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:55,314
>> WELL, LET'S NOT FORGET THEY

32
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:57,216
HAVE WHAT MANY CALL A BROMANCE

33
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:58,851
WHEN MACRON DID COME TO THE

34
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,352
UNITED STATES IN APRIL FOR THE

35
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,854
FIRST STATE DINNER UNDER THE

36
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,789
PRESIDENT TRUMP PRESIDENCY.

37
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,491
THERE WAS LOTS OF HANDSHAKES AND

38
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:05,791
HUGS.

39
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,427
SO I THINK THIS HANDSHAKE PHOTO

40
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:10,029
IS HOW THE RELATIONSHIP'S

41
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:10,362
CHANGED.

42
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,563
ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK

43
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:13,866
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID WANT TO

44
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:14,833
ACCOMPLISH IN THIS MEETING WAS

45
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,836
COME IN, BE STRONG, BE VERY

46
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:18,237
PRO-AMERICA.

47
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:19,972
I THINK A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES

48
00:01:19,972 --> 00:01:21,573
DISAGREE WITH HIM ON TARIFFS,

49
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:23,509
BUT I THINK HE WANTED TO ASSERT

50
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:24,943
WHAT HE THINKS THE UNITED STATES

51
00:01:24,943 --> 00:01:26,979
SHOULD BE IN WHEN IT COMES TO

52
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:27,379
TRADE DEALS.

53
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,580
AND IT'S, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU

54
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,482
TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF OUR

55
00:01:30,482 --> 00:01:32,051
ALLIES, NOT ALL OF THEM TOOK

56
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,152
KINDLY TO THAT.

57
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:33,552
ABBY: YEAH.

58
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,887
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH

59
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,488
FUN ON SOCIAL MEDIA THESE DAYS

60
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:37,890
WITH THESE PHOTOS OF THESE

61
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,924
IMPORTANT MEETINGS.

62
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:39,758
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE, PRESIDENT

63
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:41,460
TRUMP WITH ANGELA MERKEL.

64
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,861
EVERYONE HAS SEEN THIS PICTURE

65
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,596
BY NOW, SHE'S BASICALLY STARING

66
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:44,997
HIM DOWN.

67
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:46,732
WHO KNOWS, BEVERLY, WHAT WAS

68
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:47,866
ACTUALLY GOING ON IN THAT

69
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:48,200
MOMENT.

70
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,201
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BEEN

71
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:52,104
A FLY ON THE WALL AND ALSO KNOW

72
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:53,572
WHAT SHINZO ABE WAS THINKING.

73
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,375
BUT HERE'S A TWEET: ANGELA

74
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,643
MERKEL'S OFFICE HAS RELEASED

75
00:01:57,643 --> 00:02:00,346
THIS PHOTO TAKEN TODAY AT THE G7

76
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:01,947
WHICH TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT HOW

77
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:02,381
THINGS WENT.

78
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:02,948
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

79
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:05,351
>> A PICTURE CAN SPEAK A

80
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:05,818
THOUSAND WORDS.

81
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:07,920
I THINK IT'S A VERY POWERFUL

82
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,054
IMAGE, LIKE YOU SAID.

83
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:10,455
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS

84
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:11,890
HAPPENING, BUT THE BODY LANGUAGE

85
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,258
IS FASCINATING.

86
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,026
YOU HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH

87
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:16,462
HIS ARMS FOLDED, ANGELA MERKEL

88
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,430
KIND OF PEERING OVER HIM IN A

89
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,098
VERY OMINOUS WAY.

90
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:20,733
AND I THINK THIS SHOWS PERFECTLY

91
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:22,134
THE TENSION THAT WAS AT THIS

92
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:22,468
MEETING.

93
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:23,702
I WILL SAY ONE OF THE MOST

94
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:25,404
POSITIVE THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF

95
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:26,805
IT, SOMETHING THAT I HOPE DOES

96
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:28,374
HAPPEN IS THAT THE PRESIDENT DID

97
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:32,411
SAY THAT HE WANTS TO MOVE

98
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:33,379
FORWARD WITH TRADE AGREEMENTS

99
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,947
THAT ARE TARIFF-FREE AND FREE

100
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:35,247
TRADE.

101
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:36,348
THAT IS A GOOD THING.

102
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:38,650
ABBY: SO HE DID Q&A AT THE END,

103
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,752
THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE

104
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:41,820
MOST ENTERTAINING PARTS OF THE

105
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,322
SUMMIT, AND HE CALLS OUT A

106
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:44,323
REPORTER -- THE PRESIDENT

107
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:45,991
DOES -- AND IS ASKS THEM WHO ARE

108
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,394
THEY REPORTING FOR.

109
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:48,794
WATCH THIS.

110
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,830
>> THERE WAS A SENSE THAT THE

111
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,265
AMERICAN ALLIES WERE FRUSTRATED

112
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:55,534
AND THAT YOU'RE LEAVING HERE TO

113
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:57,970
GO MEET FOR FRIENDLIER TALKS

114
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,304
WITH KIM JONG UN IN SINGAPORE,

115
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,240
AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU VIEW

116
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,540
IT --

117
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,375
>> WHO ARE YOU WITH, OUT OF

118
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:03,742
CURIOSITY?

119
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:04,076
IS.

120
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:04,543
>> CNN.

121
00:03:04,543 --> 00:03:05,644
>> I FIGURED.

122
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,912
FAKE NEWS CNN.

123
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:08,347
THE WORST.

124
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:09,047
[LAUGHTER]

125
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:09,515
ABBY: BEVERLY?

126
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:11,350
>> WELL, THE TERM FAKE NEWS HAS

127
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,618
PLAYED WELL FOR HIM.

128
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:13,619
HE'S CONTINUING WITH THAT.

129
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:15,754
SO I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT AS HE

130
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:17,189
MOVES TO NORTH KOREA THOUGH WE

131
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:19,158
CAN GET OFF CALLING CNN FAKE

132
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,293
NEWS FOR NOW AND GET TO SOME

133
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:22,561
AGREEMENTS, BUT IT'S ALWAYS

134
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:24,129
ENTERTAINING WHEN HE DOES IT.

135
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:25,431
ABBY: YEAH, IT IS.

136
00:03:25,431 --> 00:00:00,000
AN IMPORTANT COUPLE DAYS TO GO,
