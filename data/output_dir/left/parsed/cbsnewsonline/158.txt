HE IS TRYING TO GET OTHER 
PEOPLE TO GO WITH HIS STORY, GO 
WITH WHAT HE IS SAYING, WHAT HE 
DID AND WHAT HE DIDN'T DO. 
AND SO HE WAS TRYING TO GET 
MESSAGES TO THOSE PEOPLE. 
NOW, IT DOESN'T LIST WHO THOSE 
PEOPLE ARE IN THE DOCUMENTATION 
BUT IT IS BELIEVED TO BE SOME 
OF THE PEOPLE THAT 
INVESTIGATORS ALREADY KNOW 
ABOUT THAT WERE BROUGHT UP 
BEFORE IN THE CHARGES. 
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS -- HAS 
BASICALLY TWO THINGS TO SAY 
ABOUT THIS. 
ONE, THAT PAUL MANAFORT WAS 
BROUGHT IN AND WAS NOT INVOLVED 
IN THE CAMPAIGN VERY MUCH. 
PEOPLE DISPUTE THAT. 
>> WE TAKE YOU NOW TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING. 
THERE SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS AT 
THE PODIUM SPEAKING TO 
REPORTERS. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> BECAUSE OF THIS PRESIDENT'S 
POLICIES OF LOWER TAXES, 
DEREGULATION, AND FAIR AND 
RECIPROCAL TRADE. 
AMERICA'S ECONOMIC POTENTIAL 
HAS BEEN UNLEASHED. 
I'VE INVITED KEVIN HASSETT TO 
JOIN US TODAY AND OFFER MORE 
DETAILS ABOUT THE GROWING 
ECONOMY AND TAKE QUESTIONS ON 
THIS TOPIC. 
AFTER THAT I WILL COME UP AND 
TAKE QUESTIONS OF THE NEWS OF 
THE DAY. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
AND, YOU KNOW, I WATCH THESE 
THINGS A LOT. 
AND I WAS NOTICING THAT NOT 
EVERYBODY IS ALWAYS IN THE BEST 
MOOD. 
SO I TOLD SARAH WHAT YOU GUYS 
NEED ARE SOME CHARTS. 
SO WE'VE GOT SOME CHARTS FOR 
YOU TODAY. 
I KNOW. 
I COULD SEE. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF NODDING 
PEOPLE. 
SO -- SO I THINK THAT SARAH 
SAID IT BEST. 
THAT WE'RE IN AS THE PRESIDENT 
HAS TWEETED, ONE OF THE BEST 
ECONOMIES I HAVE SEEN IN MY 
CAREER. 
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTS 
THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE 
LAST FEW MONTHS THAT ARE 
CONFIRMING SOME OF THE STUFF 
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST FALL 
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT, GOSH, IT 
WAS MAYBE NOVEMBER THE TAX 
BILL. 
AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT 
THE TAX BILL MIGHT HAVE ON THE 
ECONOMY. 
IN ADDITION, THE PRESIDENT HAS 
PURSUED TRADE AGENDA AND 
DEREGULATION AND WE'RE SEEING 
THE EFFECTS OF ALL OF THIS IN 
THE DATA. 
IN THE FIRST SLIDE IF WE CAN 
GET IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE 
WAYS OF SUMMARY OF HOW THE 
ECONOMY IS DOING. 
LOOK AT THE GPD GROWTH OVER THE 
PREVIOUS YEAR. 
YOU MAY RECALL WHEN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP RAN FOR OFFICE AND CAME 
IN AND WHEN I BEGAN OVER A YEAR 
AGO WE WERE ARE LOOKING AHEAD 
TO 3% GROWTH AND EVERYBODY SAID 
NO WE HAVE A NEW NORMAL, THE 
BLUE LINE THAT'S WE SEE DURING 
THE OBAMA ERA WHERE WE HAVE 
GROWTH IN THE ONES AND TWOS BUT 
WE COULD NEVER GET 3% GROWTH 
AGAIN. 
IN THE LATEST DATA THAT WE'VE 
GOT, WE HAVE GROWTH YEAR OVER 
YEAR A SMIDGE LESS THAN 3%. 
GPD WILL BE HIGH ENOUGH TO MAKE 
THE YEAR OVER YEAR 3.1 TO 3.2. 
THERE HAS BEEN A CLEAR TREND 
BREAK AND WE HAVE GONE FROM A 
NEW NORMAL OF LOW GROWTH TO 
JUST NORMAL, WHICH IS 3% THAT 
AMERICANS USE TODAY EXPECT. 
CAN I HAVE THE NEXT SLIDE, 
PLEASE. 
IN THIS CHART, I WANT TO SHOW 
SOMETHING THAT WE AGAIN TALKED 
ABOUT IN THE FALL. 
WHICH IS THAT ONE OF THE REAPS 
WHY WE HAD SUCH LOW GROWTH IN 
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IS 
IT WAS SO ANTIBUSINESS AND IT 
WAS BASICALLY DISCOURAGING 
CAPITAL FORMATION IN THE U.S. 
WITH INAPPROPRIATE TAX POLICY 
AND HIGH REGULATION. 
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE 
DATA. 
IF YOU LOOK AT, FOR EXAMPLE, 
THE BLUE DOT FROM Q12014 TO 
Q12015, CAPITAL SPENDING BARELY 
INCREASED AT ALL. 
IN PRE-ELECTION 2016 IT STAYED 
AT THE SAME LEVEL. 
SUBSEQUENTLY AFTER THE ELECTION 
WE STARTED TO SEE A BIG 
INCREASE IN BUSINESS SENTIMENTS 
AND CAPITAL SPENDING STARTED TO 
GO UP UP NOW THAT WE HAVE 
PASSED THE TAX BILL, SPENDING 
HAS SKY ROCKETED AND THE 
CAPITAL SPENDING IS ONE OF THE 
KEY FACTORS DRIVING GROWTH AT 
THIS TIME. 
I CAN REMEMBER WAY, WAY BACK IN 
THE FALL SAYING THAT IF WE PASS 
THE TAX BILL WE WOULD EXPECT TO 
SEE CAPITAL SPENDING THIS YEAR 
HIGHER BY 10%. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST BAR IN 
THE FIRST QUARTER OF GPD, 
CAPITAL SPEND WAS UP. 
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE. 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER 
THINGS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT. 
AND BELIEVE ME WE COULD GO ALL 
DAY BUT I PROMISED SARAH I 
WOULD STOP AT TEN MINUTES. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS MOST 
STRIKING BECAUSE IT HAS A BIG 
IMPACT ON THE OUTLOOK FOR SMALL 
BUSINESSES. 
RIGHT NOW SMALL BUSINESSES ARE 
AS OPTIMISTIC SINCE WE HAVE 
SEEN SINCE WE BEGAN SURVEYING 
THEM. 
IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE -- YOU 
CAN SAY WELL SOMETIMES -- THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WILL SAY 
WE SET THIS ECONOMY UP FOR THE 
PRESIDENT. 
YOU CAN SEE A CLEAR BREAK IN 
THE CHART AT THE ELECTION. 
SO PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED 
THAT WOE CUT TAXES, THAT HE 
WOULD REDUCE TAX ON SMALL 
BUSINESS AND REDUCE THE HEAVY 
REGULATORY COSTS IMPOSED BY THE 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. 
EVEN BEFORE HE BEGAN TO ACT, 
THE SENTIMENT TURNED AROUND. 
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE. 
AND THAT'S HELPED LEAD TO 
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY ONE  
THE MORE REMARKABLE LABOR 
MARKETS WE HAVE SEEN. 
THE JOB MARKET IS ABOUT AS 
STRONG AS I'VE EVER SEEN. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT 
WAYS TO PUT IT INTO 
PERSPECTIVE. 
FOR ME THE EASIEST FACT IS IT 
IS ONLY SEVEN TIMES BACK TO 
1907 THAT WE'VE HAD AN 
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BACK TO 4%. 
TWO OF THE MONTHS WERE THE LAST 
TWO MONTHS. 
WE EXPECT THAT WILL CONTINUE. 
AS REMARKABLE AS THAT CHART IS, 
I THINK THE NEXT ONE IS THE ONE 
THAT MOVES ME EVEN MORE. 
THE NEXT CHART SHOWS THE GAP 
BETWEEN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 
OF WHITE WORKERS AND BLACK 
WORKERS. 
AND YOU CAN SEE THE GAP IN 
BETWEEN THE EMPLOYMENT RATE FOR 
BLACK WORKERS AND WHITE WORKERS 
HAS GONE TO AN ALL-TIME LOW. 
IT IS ABOUT A THIRD WHAT IT WAS 
ON AVERAGE DURING THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
OF COURSE WE WANT THAT GAP TO 
GET ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ZERO. 
WE HAVE MADE A TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT OF PROGRESS BECAUSE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WORKING TO 
HEAT UP THE ECONOMY. 
THE NEXT CHART FOR A PERSON WHO 
LOVES ECONOMIC DATA IS REALLY 
MY FAVORITE BECAUSE YOU RARELY 
EVER SEE ANYTHING THAT IS THE 
BEST SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
IN ECONOMIC DATA. 
THIS CHART SHOWS THAT THE 
INITIAL CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT 
INSURANCE WHICH IS THOSE PEOPLE 
THAT HAVE THE REALLY BAD NEWS 
THEY LOST THEIR JOB AND SHOW UP 
AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE TO 
COLLECT THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT 
INSURANCE IS THE LOWEST SINCE 
THE SECOND WORLD WAR. 
ONE OF THE MOST DISRUPTIVE 
THICK THAT CAN HAPPEN IS LOSING 
YOUR JOB. 
THERE IS NOT A BETTER ECONOMY 
FOR THIS THAN SINCE THE SECOND 
WORLD WAR. 
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ABOUT 
THIS. 
THIS IS JUST A CHART OF WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED TO AMERICANS' 
WEALTH SINCE THE PRESIDENT WAS 
ELECTED. 
THIS IS HOW MUCH THEY HAVE IN 
THEIR CHECKING ACCOUNTS, 
SECRETARIES, WHAT THE VALUE OF 
THEIR HOUSE IS AND THE VALUE OF 
EQUITY MARKETS. 
WEALTH HAS INCREASED BY 7 
TRILLION DOLLARS. 
I WOULD GUESS WHEN WE SEE THE 
DATA OVER THE NEXT COMING 
QUARTERS WE'RE GOING TO CROSS 
THE 100 TRILLION MARK FOR 
AMERICANS WEALTH. 
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE 
PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC POLICIES 
ARE WORKING. 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS 
THEY'RE WORKING FOR AMERICA'S 
WORKERS. 
THEY'RE BEING LAID OFF AT THE 
LOWEST MACE WE HAVE SEEN AND 
WAGE GROWTH IS ALSO TAKING UP 
AS WELL. 
WITH THAT, I WILL OPEN UP FOR A 
FEW QUESTIONS. 
I PROMISED SARAH I WOULD KEEP 
IT AT THREE OR FOUR. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US 
TODAY. 
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 3.8% LAST 
MONTH. 
BUT THE LABOR PARTICIPATION 
RATE STILL LAGS FOUR POINTS 
BELONG WHERE IT WAS THE LAST 
TIME THAT UNEMPLOYMENT WAS DOWN 
BELOW 4%. 
WHAT CAN THIS WHITE HOUSE DO TO 
INCREASE THE LABOR 
PARTICIPATION RATE? 
>> WELL, THIS WHITE HOUSE HAS 
GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE 
CAMPAIGN WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS 
SPEAKING TO THE FORGOTTEN 
PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE WHO HAD 
EXITED THE LABOR FORCE BECAUSE 
THEY WERE SO DISCOURAGED THAT 
THEY HAD GIVEN UP. 
WE SAID WE DON'T BELIEVE THE 
STORY THAT WAS BEING PUSHED BY 
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION 
THAT THERE'S NO HOPE FOR YOU. 
WE THINK YOU SHOULD GET BACK TO 
THE LABOR FORCE. 
AS OF -- I DID THIS CALCULATION 
AS OF THE LAST JOBS REPORT. 
I HAVEN'T UPDATED IT FOR THIS 
JOB REPORT. 
900,000 PEOPLE -- 900,000 
AMERICANS OUT OF THE LABOR 
FORCE HAVE GOTTEN A JOB SINCE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. 
SO I'LL GO BACK TO YOU, MA'AM. 
>> YES. 
THANK YOU. 
TWO QUESTIONS. 
DOES THIS ADMINISTRATION PUT 
INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION HAD -- THEY WERE 
DEALING WITH A RECESSION. 
COMING OUT OF A RECESSION. 
DO YOU TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
NUMBERS, COMPARING APPLES TO 
ORANGES? 
AND THEN GOING INTO BLACK 
UNEMPLOYMENT. 
THE NUMBERS HAVE COME DOWN. 
HISTORICALLY THE NUMBERS HAVE 
ALWAYS BEEN ONE AND A HALF TO 
TWO TIMES EVEN GREATER THAN 
THAT OF WHITE AMERICA. 
WILL THIS ADMINISTRATION SINCE 
YOU LOVE TO TOUT THOSE NUMBERS 
EFFECTIVELY TARGET IN TO BRING 
THAT GAP TO -- 
>> SO FIRST THE GREAT 
RECESSION, THAT WAS THE 
TARGETING POINT OF SOMETHING 
THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING 
OBJECT. 
THE GREAT RECESSION ABSOLUTELY 
SLOWED GROWTH IN THE EARLY 
YEARS OF THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
NORMALLY WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE 
SEEN IN THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
AT THE END OF THE 
ADMINISTRATION THAT THE CAPITAL 
SPENDING AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
WOULD BE GETTING BACK TO 
NORMAL. 
AND THAT WASN'T HAPPENING. 
THAT WAS CLEARLY IN THE DATA. 
AS FOR THE TARGETING, I THINK 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE 
SPOKE THEN THIS ROOM ABOUT 
BEFORE THAT THE PRESIDENT TALKS 
A LOT ABOUT IS INCREASING JOBS 
IN GOODS PRODUCING INDUSTRY, 
THAT IS MANUFACTURING AND 
CONSTRUCTION. 
THOSE GOODS PRODUCING 
INDUSTRIES ARE CREATING JOBS 
RIGHT NOW AT A PACE THAT IS A 
LITTLE UNDER 50,000 A MONTH. 
THAT PACES ABOUT DOUBLE WHAT IT 
WAS UNDER THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
IT IS PRECISELY THE THING THAT 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
TARGETING. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RACIAL 
DISPARITIES ACROSS DIFFERENT 
PROFESSIONS, IT IS THE GOOD 
PRODUCING INDUSTRY THAT'S ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REDUCTION 
IN THE BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. 
I WILL LET YOU HAVE ONE FOLLOW-
UP. 
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT. 
WHEN IT COMES TO CONSTRUCTION, 
IT IS KNOWN MORE SO AS A BOOST 
FOR HISPANIC WORKERS. 
WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU GOING 
TO DO TO TARGET AFRICAN-
AMERICANS SINCE YOU ARE TALKING 
ABOUT -- YOU GUYS TOUT THESE 
NUMBERS. 
>> THESE POLICIES ARE CLEARLY 
WORKING. 
THE GAP IS THE LOWEST IN 
HISTORY. 
HE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT THAT. 
CAN I MOVE BACK HERE? 
YELLOW TIE. 
YES, THANK YOU. 
>> LET'S TURN TO TREND FOR A 
SECOND. 
UNITED STATES AS IT STANDS 
RIGHT NOW POSSIBLE TERRORISTS, 
CHINA HAS ITS STANCE ON 
POSSIBLE TARIFFS. 
HAVE YOU MODELED AT ALL IF 
THERE IS A TRADE WAR BETWEEN 
THE U.S. AND CHINA HOW THAT 
WOULD IMPACT THE U.S. ECONOMY 
AND AS WELL YOU'VE HAD 
REPUBLICANS OVER THE LAST 
COUPLE OF MONTHS WHO HAVE SAID 
THE ONE THING THAT CAN STALL 
TAX REFORM, THE IMPACTS ON THE 
ECONOMY AS THEY SEE IT IS THE 
PRESIDENT'S TRADE POLICY. 
ARE THEY ON TO SOMETHING THERE. 
>> LOOK THE ECONOMIC REPORT OF 
THE PRESIDENT THAT WE PUT OUT A 
FEW MONTHS AGO DOCUMENTED 
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT 
HAS TALKED ABOUT VERY 
EMOTIONALLY AT TIMES, GOING 
BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN THAT. 
OUR TRADE DEALS ARE VERY 
SYMMETRIC. 
THAT OUR MARKETS ARE OPEN TO 
IMPORTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES 
BUT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE 
ASYMMETRIC TREATMENT OF US. 
THE PRESIDENT'S OBJECTIVE IS TO 
GET FULLY RECIPROCAL TRADE 
DEALS. 
IF YOU MODEL A FUTURE WHERE 
EVERYBODY ELSE REDUCES THEIR 
TRADE BARRIERS TO OURS THAT, IS 
MASSIVELY GOOD FOR THE GLOBAL 
ECONOMY AND MASSIVELY GOOD FOR 
THE U.S. ECONOMY. 
THE PRESIDENT WROTE THE BOOK 
THE ART OF THE DEAL. 
WE'RE INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATIONS 
AND WE'RE HOPEFUL WE REACH THAT 
EQUILIBRIUM. 
>> THANK YOU, KEVIN. 
I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE 
BENEFITS OF THE TAX CUT 
LEGISLATION THAT THE PRESIDENT 
SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER. 
A MORGAN STANLEY SURVEY FOUND 
THAT 43% OF THE TAX CUTS 
SAVINGS ARE GOING TO STOP BUY 
BACKS AND DIVIDENDS. 
13% ARE GOING TO EMPLOYEE 
RAISES AND BONUSES, EMPLOYEE 
BENEFIT. 
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU 
ARE SEEING THAT IMPACT. 
THAT SO MUCH MORE SEEMS TO BE 
GOING TO WALL STREET THAN MAIN 
STREET. 
>> NOT AT ALL. 
IF THAT WAGE GROWTH RIGHT NOW 
IS THE HIGHEST -- IF YOU LOOK 
OVER THE LAST QUARTER THE 
EMPLOYMENT COST INDEX IS THE 
HIGHEST BACK TO 2006. 
THAT'S WHEN THEY CHANGED THE 
WAY THEY DO DATA. 
WE HAVE MORE THAN 6 MILLION 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ANNOUNCED A PAY 
RAISE BECAUSE OF THE TAX BILL. 
THE AVERAGE PAY RAISE IS NORTH 
OF $1,200. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID AGAIN AND 
AGAIN AND CEA SAID AGAIN AND 
AGAIN THAT THERE WOULD BE A 
$4,000 INCREASE IN PAY FOR 
PEOPLE IF WE PASS THE TAX BILL. 
AND PEOPLE SAID THAT NUMBER WAS 
COMPLETELY IMPLAUSIBLE. 
LET'S LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. 
WAL-MART HAS INCREASED THE 
MINIMUM WAGE FOR THE LOWEST 
PAID WORKERS AT WAL-MART BY $2 
AN HOUR. 
IF YOU RUN THAT FORWARD, THAT 
IS A LITTLE LESS THAN $4,000 A 
YEAR. 
SO IF THE LOWEST PAID PEOPLE AT 
WAL-MART ARE GETTING THE 
$4,000, THE PRESIDENT HAS 
PROMISED THEN WE'RE NOT 
DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAGE DATA. 
QUESTION OVER HERE. 
>> IT IS GOING TO WALL STREET 
THAN MAIN STREET. 
>> JUST A FOLLOW-UP ON THE 
QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED 
EARLIER. 
TARIFFS. 
DO YOU PREDICT OWEYAND IT WAS 
THE TRADE QUESTION I GUESS THAT 
BLAKE WAS ASKING, FOLLOWING UP 
ON. 
THERE IS A PREDICTION THAT 
INCREASE TARIFFS WILL DEPRESS 
THE ECONOMY. 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS ENGAGED 
IN, DO YOU FORESEE ANY PROBLEMS 
WITH THE TARIFFS THAT HE HAS 
IMPLEMENTED AND WHAT WOULD BE 
YOUR REACTION TO IT. 
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS 
PUSHING OUR TRADING PARTNERS 
HARD TO MAKE THEIR DEALS FAIR 
FOR AMERICA'S WORKERS AND THAT 
IS HIS OBJECTIVE AND THERE ARE 
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS RIGHT NOW. 
I KNOW A LOT OF OTHER 
PRESIDENTS. 
I WAS OVER HERE AS AN OUTSIDER 
COMING TO TALK TO PRESIDENT 
OBAMA'S TEAM ABOUT THIS. 
A LOT OF PRESIDENTS WANTED TO 
MAKE BETTER DEALS AND FAILED. 
THIS PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING TO 
FAIL AT THAT. 
HE IS GOING TO MAKE BETTER 
DEALS. 
>> WOULD THAT DEPRESS THE 
ECONOMY, HIGHER TARIFFS? 
DO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COULD 
HURT THE ECONOMY. 
>> WE THINK WE WILL GET FAIR 
TRADE DEALS. 
>> JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT A 
LITTLE BIT. 
BEFORE YOU SAID -- WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT SAID ALSO IS THAT -- 
TALKING ABOUT TARIFFS WOULD BE 
MORE OF A NEGOTIATING TACTIC AS 
MUCH AS ANYTHING. 
HOW FAR THOUGH CAN THIS BE A 
NEGOTIATING TACTIC? 
OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T HAVE A 
TRADE BARRIER. 
>> I REJECT THAT IT IS A 
NEGOTIATING TACTIC PATIO YOU 
ARELY. 
FOR EXAMPLE, THE STEEL TARIFFS 
WERE PUT IN PLACE AS A NATIONAL 
SECURITY CONCERN. 
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMANDER IN 
CHIEF HE IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE 
JUDGMENTS AT A TIME OF WAR WE 
HAVE TO PRODUCE STEEL. 
THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS GOING 
ON IN THE 301 SPACE TO USE THE 
BASEBALL TERM. 
WE'RE TRYING TO STOP CHINA FROM 
DEALING OUR INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY AND OPEN THEIR MARKET 
TO OUR PRODUCTS. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS GOING 
ON RIGHT NOW. 
I THINK -- LAST QUESTION, SIR. 
OKAY. 
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY INDICATION 
WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF THE 
NAFTA NEGOTIATIONS? 
THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT THE 
UNITED STATES MIGHT WANT TO 
BREAK UP THE NAFTA 
NEGOTIATIONS. 
A DIRECT DEAL WITH MEXICO. 
IS THAT THE RIGHT APPROACH? 
>> I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT'S 
APPROACH IS TO NEGOTIATE WITH 
MEXICO AND NEGOTIATE WITH 
CANADA AND MAKE BETTER DEALS. 
AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU 
WILL HAVE TO TALK TO INVESTOR 
LIGHTHEISER ABOUT THE CURRENT 
NEGOTIATIONS. 
>> THANKS, KEVIN. 
LAST ONE ADDITIONAL UPDATE. 
THE PRESIDENT AND THE 
ADMINISTRATION APPLAUDS SENATOR 
MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL AND 
HIS DECISION TO CANCEL THE 
MAJORITY OF THE AUGUST RECESS 
AND REMAIN IN SESSION. 
THERE'S BEEN HISTORIC 
OBSTRUCTION BY SENATE DEMOCRATS 
AND THERE'S A LONG TO-DO LIST, 
INCLUDING IMPORTANT NOMINATIONS 
AND APPROPRIATIONS BILL THAT'S 
WE HOPE THEY CAN GET TAKEN CARE 
OF. 
WITH THAT, I WILL TAKE YOUR 
QUESTIONS. 
JONATHAN. 
>> ON THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION 
TO DISINVITE THE EAGLES, HE IS 
SUGGESTING THIS IS ABOUT THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
IS THE PRESIDENT AWARE THAT NOT 
A SINGLE PLAYER ON THE EAGLES 
FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON KNELT FOR 
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
>> THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION ON 
NOT JUST THE ANTHEM BEING CLEAR 
LET'S NOT FORGET THIS ISN'T -- 
THERE WERE 80 MEMBERS OF THE 
EAGLES ORGANIZATION THAT RSVP 
AND COMMIT TODAY ATTEND THIS 
EVENT AS RECENTLY AS FRIDAY AS 
WELL AS OVER A THOUSAND FANS OF 
THE EAGLES ORGANIZATION. 
AND THE EAGLES ARE THE ONES 
THAT TRIED TO CHANGE THEIR 
COMMITMENT AT THE 11th HOUR. 
AND THE PRESIDENT FRANKLY 
THINKS THAT THE FANS DESERVE 
BETTER THAN THAT. 
AND THEREFORE WE CHANGED THE 
CEREMONY TO BE A FOCUS ON 
CELEBRATING OUR GREAT COUNTRY. 
>> WHY DOES HE THINK THIS IS 
ABOUT THE NATIONAL ANTHEM? 
WE HEARD FROM STEPH CURRY AND 
LEBRON JAMES THAT WHOEVER WINS 
THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP, THEY'RE 
UNLIKELY TO BE HERE. 
IS THIS ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER 
THAN THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
>> IF THIS WASN'T A POLITICAL 
STUNT BY THE EAGLES FRANCHISE, 
THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE PLANNED 
TO ATTEND THE EVENT AND BACKED 
OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE. 
IF IT WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT, 
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ATTEMPTED TO 
RESCHEDULE THE VISIT WHEN THEY 
KNEW THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 
GOING TO BE OVERSEAS. 
IF THIS WASN'T A POLITICAL 
STUNT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE 
WAITED UNTIL MONDAY, WELL AFTER 
A THOUSAND OF THEIR FANS HAD 
TRAVELED AND TAKEN TIME OUT OF 
THEIR SCHEDULES TO OFFER ONLY A 
TINY HANDFUL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
TO ATTEND THE EVENT. 
PAMELA. 
>> ON THAT POINT, THIS ISN'T 
ABOUT THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, IT 
IS ABOUT SO FEW PLAYERS COMING 
IN THE END. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY 
CLEAR WHAT HIS POSITION IS WITH 
REGARDS TO THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
WE HAVE NEVER WAIVERRED ON 
THAT. 
THE PRESIDENT THINKS THAT 
PEOPLE SHOULD STAND FOR THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO 
THE NFL. 
IT IS NOT ABOUT A PARTICULAR 
TEAM. 
IT IS ABOUT HAVING PRIDE IN OUR 
COUNTRY AND ABOUT BEING 
RESPECTFUL TO THE MEN AND WOMEN 
WHO HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED TO 
PRESERVE OUR COUNTRY. 
IN TERMS OF THIS, THE EAGLES 
ARE THE ONES THAT CHANGED THEIR 
COMMITMENT AT THE LAST MINUTE. 
THE PRESIDENT FELT IT WAS 
APPROPRIATE TO CHANGE THE EVENT 
TO BE A CEREMONY TO CELEBRATE 
OUR COUNTRY. 
>> JUST TO FOLLOW UP, SARAH. 
YESTERDAY ON THE STATEMENT THAT 
YOU MADE YOU REFERRED US TO THE 
OUTSIDE COUNSEL ON THE DON 
JUNIOR STATEMENT THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS INVOLVED IN. 
THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL WEIGHED IN 
SAYING YES THE PRESIDENT DID 
DICTATE THE STATEMENT. 
GIULIANI WAS ON CNN SAYING IT 
WAS A MISTAKE TO SAY THAT THE 
PRESIDENT DIDN'T DICTATE IT. 
DO YOU WANT TO CORRECT THE 
RECORD ON YOUR STATEMENT FROM 
AUGUST WHEN YOU SAID THAT HE 
CERTAINLY DIDN'T DICTATE. 
>> ONCE AGAIN I'M NOT GOING TO 
GO INTO DETAIL. 
AND GO INTO A BACK AND FORTH. 
AND I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS WOULD 
LOVE TO ENGAGE ON MATTERS OF 
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL AND THE OUTSIDE 
COUNSEL BUT WE HAVE PURPOSEDLY 
WALLED OFF. 
I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON THE 
OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 
>> YOU STILL TALKED ABOUT IT. 
WHY CAN'T YOU CORRECT THE 
RECORD NOW. 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER 
QUESTIONS THAT DEAL 
SPECIFICALLY WITH CONVERSATIONS 
BETWEEN THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. 
>> YOU WON'T ANSWER THE 
QUESTION. 
>> AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO GET 
INTO A BACK AND FORTH WITH YOU 
ON THAT. 
I REFER TO YOU OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WON 
PENNSYLVANIA BY A NARROW 
MARGIN. 
HE IS LOOKING TO PICK UP A 
SENATE SEAT THERE. 
>> CERTAINLY WE WOULD HOPE THAT 
ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF 
PENNSYLVANIA WOULD SHARE THE 
PRESIDENT'S COMMITMENT TO THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM AND THE PRIDE 
THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COUNTRY AND 
CERTAINLY NOT MEANT TO BE A 
SLIGHT TO ANYONE. 
BUT FRANKLY A REAFFIRMATION OF 
WHAT A GREAT COUNTRY THAT WE 
LIVE IN AND TO STAND FOR THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM IS SOMETHING 
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
VERY CLEAR ON. 
SARAH. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
ON THURSDAY, DARRELL STRAWBERRY 
WILL BE HERE. 
WHAT WILL BE IN THE MEETING? 
THE PRESIDENT SAID ANOTHER DAY 
THAT JAPAN, CHINA AND SOUTH 
KOREA CAN PROVIDE ECONOMIC 
ASSISTANCE TO NORTH KOREA. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT PLAN TO 
RAISE THIS ISSUE WITH THE PRIME 
MINISTER. 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD 
OF THE MEETING WITH THE PRIME 
MINISTER BUT WE CERTAINLY 
ANTICIPATE THE SUMMIT WITH 
NORTH KOREA THAT WILL BE NEXT 
WEEK TO COME UP AS WELL AS 
TRADE ISSUES AND OTHER MATTERS. 
AND WE WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE 
A READ OUT AND THE PRESIDENT 
WILL SPEAK TO THAT TOMORROW. 
JOSH. 
>> SCOTT PRUITT HELPED HIS WIFE 
GET A NFL FRANCHISE. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT THINK THAT 
IS AN ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR. 
>> I HAVE NOT SPOKEN WITH THE 
PRESIDENT SINCE THAT REPORT 
CAME OUT. 
>> I'M ASKING ABOUT SPECIAL 
COUNSEL, OUTSIDE COUNSEL, DO 
YOU THINK THAT YOUR STATEMENT 
IS AUGUST WAS ACCURATE? 
YOUR STATEMENT NOT HIS 
STATEMENT. 
WAS YOUR STATEMENT ACCURATE. 
>> AGAIN I I KNOW YOU WANT TO 
GET INTO A BACK AND FORTH. 
>> NOT A BACK AND FORTH. 
WE WANT TO KNOW IF WAS AFFECT 
AT. 
>> YOU WANT TO ENGAGE ME ABOUT  
COUNSEL. 
I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT TODAY. 
>> YOU SAID SOMETHING FROM THE 
PODIUM. 
WAS IT ACCURATE OR NOT? 
THAT'S ALL WE WANT TO KNOW. 
>> AGAIN, I WORKDAY IN DAY OUT 
AND I BELIEVE FRANKLY WITH THE 
MAJORITY OF YOU HERE IN THE 
ROOM I THINK YOU ALL KNOW I'M 
AN HONEST PERSON THAT WORKS 
EXTREMELY HARD TO PROVIDE YOU 
WITH ACCURATE INFORMATION AT 
ALL TIMES. 
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO 
THAT BUT I'M NOT GOING TO 
ENGAGE IN MATTER THAT'S HAVE TO 
DO WITH THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 
>> JUST TO FOLLOW ON THIS 
QUICKLY AND I THINK YOU WERE 
ASKED A QUESTION EARLIER. 
THE REASON THAT YOU'RE 
UNWILLING TO ENGAGE ON THIS 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY OR 
ANTICIPATE YOURSELF HAVING TO 
TALK TO SPECIAL COUNSEL ABOUT 
THIS STATEMENT. 
>> IT IS BECAUSE THE ANNOT ARE 
RAT VENUE FOR THESE QUESTIONS 
TO BE ADDRESSED WOULD BE 
THROUGH THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 
THAT'S WHY I WOULD REFER TO YOU 
THEM TO ANSWER THEM. 
>> THE IS IT TRUE THAT PROPOSED 
CUTS OKAY HURRICANE SANDY FUNDS 
AND FUNDING. 
I WONDER IF WE SHOULD SEE THE 
TREATS AS THE ADMINISTRATION 
INACCURATELY COMPLETING THE 
FIRST, THAT MONEY WAS NO LONGER 
NEEDED AND THAT HAPPENED IN THE 
LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. 
WHY THAT WOULDN'T BE TRUE FOR 
OTHER AREAS THAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION HAS TARGETED 
GOING FORWARD. 
>> NOT NECESSARILY BUT I WOULD 
REFER YOU TO OMD TO GET INTO 
THE DETAILS OF THAT AND WE WILL 
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS ON 
SPECIFICS WITH PRECISION. 
JOHN. 
>> SARAH, THE PRESIDENT TOOK A 
STICK TO HIS FAVORITE PIÑATA, 
JEFF SESSIONS TODAY. 
WHAT IS THE -- WHAT IS THE 
PRESIDENT'S GOAL HERE? 
IS IT SIMPLY TO REMIND THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT HE IS 
REALLY POED AT HIM. 
IS HE TRYING TO GET HIM TO 
QUIT. 
>> WHAT IS HE TRYING TO DO. 
>> HE HAS MADE HIS POSITION 
EXTREMELY CLEAR. 
JUST BECAUSE YOU LAUGHED THE 
HARDEST AT JOHN'S JOKE I FEEL 
YOU EARNED THE RIGHT. 
>> THE PRESIDENT TWEETED TODAY 
THAT HE WAS CONCERNED THAT THE 
FBI WAS WEAKENING OR SLOW 
WALKING THE D O.J. 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE HILLARY 
CLINTON E-MAIL INVESTIGATION 
HANDLED BY FBI DIRECTOR JAMES 
COMEY. 
WHAT IS HE BASING THAT CONCERN 
ON? 
IS IT BASED ON CONVERSATION 
THAT'S HE'S HAD WITH FBI 
PERSONNEL CURRENTLY OR SIMPLY 
AN OBSERVATION BASED ON THE PA 
OF THE. 
>> LOOK, I THINK THE PRESIDENT 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS PROCESS 
MOVE FASTER. 
THEY HAVE BEEN OBSESSED WITH A 
NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES IN WHICH 
THEY SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME 
ON. 
I THINK HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
SOME OF THAT SPREAD OUT. 
>> DOES HE THINK IT IS 
APPROPRIATE TO ENCOURAGE THE TO 
RELEASE ON HIS TIME FRAME. 
>> HE WANTS IT TO BE EXPEDITED 
AND COMPLETED QUICKLY ON ALL 
FRONTS. 
ANDREW. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
I WANT TODAY FOLLOW UP ON 
JOSH'S QUESTION AND SARAH'S 
QUESTION BUT IN A LARGER SENSE. 
THE PRESIDENT, WHETHER IT IS ON 
HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT OR 
OTHERWISE KEEPS SAYING THINGS 
THAT ARE NOT BORNE OUT BY THE 
FACTS. 
WHETHER IT IS THE EAGLES THING 
IS ABOUT THE NATIONAL ANTHEM OR 
WE GOT $6 BILLION FOR OPIOIDS 
AND GETTING RID OF THAT TAKING 
OVER OUR COUNTRY. 
WE HAVE A THOUSAND IMMIGRATION 
JUDGES. 
THE PRESIDENT KEEPS SAYING 
THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRUE. 
AND THIS THING WITH -- WITH 
DICTATING -- 
>> WHAT IS THE QUESTION? 
IF YOU COULD GET THERE. 
>> WHY IF THINGS THAT YOU KEEP 
SAYING FROM THE PODIUM TURN OUT 
TO NOT BE TRUE AND THINGS THAT 
THE PRESIDENT KEEPS SAYING TURN 
OUT TO NOT BE TRUE, WHY SHOULD 
WE BE ABLE TO TRUST THAT THE 
INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GETTING 
FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION IS 
ACCURATE? 
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHY 
SHOULD AMERICANS BE ABLE TO 
TRUST THAT WHAT THEY HEAR FROM 
THIS WHITE HOUSE IS ALWAYS THE 
TRUTH? 
>> ONCE AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW HOW 
MANY TIMES I HAVE TO ADDRESS 
THIS. 
BUT I WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY TO 
GIVE YOU ACCURATE AND UP TO 
DATE INFORMATION. 
AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO TO 
THAT. 
FRANKLY I THINK MY CREDIBILITY 
IS PROBABLY HIGHER THAN THE 
MEDIA'S. 
AND I THINK THAT IN LARGE PART 
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU GUYS SPEND 
MORE OF YOUR TIME FOCUSED ON 
ATTACKING THE PRESIDENT INSTEAD 
OF REPORTING THE NEWS. 
I THINK IF YOU SPENT A LITTLE 
MORE TIME REPORTING THE NEWS 
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO TEAR ME 
DOWN, YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY SEE 
THAT WE'RE WORKING HARD TRYING 
TO PROVIDE YOU GOOD INFORMATION 
AND TRYING TO PROVIDE THAT SAME 
GOOD INFORMATION TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
>>> JOHN. 
>> SORRY. 
ANDREW. 
I GAVE YOU QUITE A BIT OF TIME. 
JOHN, GO AHEAD. 
>> I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION, 
THE ADMINISTRATION'S REACTION 
TO A STATEMENT PUT OUT BY A 
PLAYER ON THE EAGLES. 
MALCOLM JENKINS. 
HE IS A SAFETY ON THE EAGLES. 
RESPECTED THROUGHOUT THE 
LEAGUE. 
HE PUT OUT A STATEMENT THAT HE 
SAID THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE 
BY THE PRESIDENT TO CANCEL THE 
EVENT PAINTS THE PICTURE THAT 
THESE PLAYERS ARE ANTIAMERICA, 
ANTI-FLAG AND ANTI-MILITARY. 
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO WHAT 
MALCOLM JENKINS PUT OUT IN A 
STATEMENT TODAY. 
>> I ADDRESSED THIS A FEW 
TIMES. 
AGAIN, THE EAGLES WERE THE ONES 
THAT COMMITTED TO AN EVENT ON 
FRIDAY. 
THEY SUBMITTED OVER 80 MEMBERS 
OF THE EAGLES FRANCHISE WITH 
THE EVENT WITH OVER A THOUSAND 
FANS TO PARTICIPATE. 
IT WAS THE EAGLES ORGANIZATION 
THAT TRIED TO CHANGE THEIR 
COMMITMENT AT THE 11th HOUR. 
ONCE AGAIN, IF IT WASN'T A 
POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY, THEY 
WOULDN'T HAVE PLAN TODAY ATTEND 
AND THEN BACKED UP. 
IF IT WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT, 
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ATTEMPTED TO 
RESCHEDULE AN EVENT WHEN THEY 
KNEW THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD 
BE OUT OF THE COUNTRY. 
AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE WAITED 
UNTIL THE VERY LAST MINUTE TO 
MAKE THESE CHANGES IF THIS 
WASN'T ABOUT SOME TIME OF 
POLITICAL STATEMENT THAT THEY 
WERE TRYING TO MAKE TOWARDS 
THIS PRESIDENT. 
CECILIA. 
>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE -- 
THE PRESIDENT -- ARE YOU SAYING 
THE PRESIDENT BEARS SEE ZERO 
RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS 
CANCELLATION? 
THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT CALLED 
NFL PLAYERS SOBs, WHO IMPLIED 
THAT SOME PLAYERS WHO DON'T 
STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM 
DO NOT BELONG IN THIS COUNTRY. 
DOES HE BEAR ZERO 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PLAYERS LIKE 
THE WARRIORS AND THE CAVS NOT 
WANTING TO COME AND THE EAGLES 
BAILING. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HIS POSITION 
HASN'T CHANGED ON THIS 
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. 
AND THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION 
WAS VERY CLEARLY STATED IN A 
NUMBER OF FORUMS AND VENUES. 
AND THE EAGLES MADE THE 
COMMITMENT TO COME AND TO BE 
PRT OF THAT EVENT WELL AFTER 
THE PRESIDENT HAD ESTABLISHED 
HIS FEELINGS IN REGARDS TO THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
AND ONCE AGAIN THEY MADE THAT 
CHANGE AT THE LAST MINUTE, NOT 
THE PRESIDENT. 
HE IS THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN 
COMPLETELY CONSISTENT IN HIS 
VIEWPOINT WHEN IT COMES TO 
THIS. 
>> THE PRESIDENT BROKE WITH 
RECENT TRADITION AND DID NOT 
HOST AN IFTAR DINNER. 
IS HE HOSTED SUCH A DINNER THIS 
YEAR AND CAN YOU TELL US HOW 
THE INVITEEES WERE SELECTED. 
>> HE IS HOSTING THE DINNER 
TOMORROW EVENING. 
THERE WILL BE A -- ROUGHLY 30 
TO 40 DIFFERENT ATTENDEES. 
I BELIEVE IT TAKES PLACE AROUND 
8:45 TOMORROW EVENING. 
BLAKE. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT TWO 
POSSIBLE TRADE DEALS. 
ONE INVOLVING THE CHINESE IN 
WHICH IT WOULD BE $70 BILLION 
OF BUYING AMERICAN PRODUCTS. 
THE UNITED STATES WOULD BACK 
OFF ITS THREAT OF TARIFFS. 
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD SUPPORT. 
>> WE'RE IN THE NEGOTIATION 
PROCESS AND. 
AS KEVIN SAID AND AS THE 
PRESIDENT HAS STATED MANY TIMES 
BEFORE, OUR FOCUS IS ON MAKING 
SURE THAT WE GET GOOD DEALS. 
HE IS GOING TO PUSH FORWARD TO 
MAKE SURE THAT HE GETS THE BEST 
DEAL FOR AMERICAN WORKERS. 
JOHN. 
>> LARRY SAID TODAY THAT MAYBE 
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO DEAL 
WITH CANADA SOLELY, WITH MEXICO 
SOLELY, AND THAT THE IDEA OF 
NEGOTIATING NAFTA MIGHT BE GONE 
AT THIS POINT. 
DID THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING 
TO A NAFTA DEAL DONE AS THIS 
ADMINISTRATION SEES IT. 
>> IT IS NOT DONE BUT AGAIN THE 
PRESIDENT IS OPEN TO HAVING 
INDIVIDUAL DEALS. 
BUT HE IS LOOKING AT THE BEST 
WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT HE GETS 
THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE FOR 
AMERICAN WORKERS AND WHETHER OR 
NOT THAT'S THROUGH NAFTA OR 
OTHER MEANS, THAT IS ON THE 
TABLE. 
>>> JOHN. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
BACK TO THE ISSUE OF 
PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS. 
THERE'S BEEN CONSIDERABLE 
CONSIDERABLE AND ALLIES IN 
CONGRESS ABOUT HIM EVEN 
SUGGESTING THE SENTENCE OF ROD 
BLAGOJEVICH. 
MANY ARE COMING INCREASINGLY 
OUTSPOKEN. 
IS HE GOING TO GO AHEAD WITH 
THE COMMUNE OR IS HE BACKING 
DOWN AND IS HE AWARE OF THE 
CRITICISM FROM SUPPORTERS OF 
HIS. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT MADE A 
FINAL DECISION BUT AS YOU KNOW 
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T BASE HIS 
DECISIONS OFF OF THE CRITICISM 
OF OTHERS BUT ON WHAT HE THINKS 
IS THE RIGHT DECISION TO MAKE. 
THAT'S WHAT HE WILL BASE IT ON. 
DAVE. 
>> SARAH, THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO 
MEETING WITH LAWMAKERS HERE 
THIS AFTERNOON. 
WHAT IS ON THE AGENDA? 
>> A NUMBER OF ITEMS WILL BE 
DISCUSSED AT THAT EVENT. 
AND WE WILL BE SURE TO PROVIDE 
INFO AFTERWARDS. 
HUNTER. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT STILL THINK 
HIS RESPONSE TO THE HURRICANE 
IN PUERTO RICO DESERVES A TEN 
OUT OF TEN SCORE NOW THAT 
ESTIMATES SAY THAT ALMOST 5,000 
PEOPLE DIED THERE? 
>> THE FEDERAL RESPONSE ONCE 
AGAIN WAS AT A HISTORIC 
PROPORTION. 
WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH 
THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO AND 
DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN TO 
PROVIDE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE, 
PARTICULARLY WORKING WITH THE 
GOVERNOR THERE IN PUERTO RICO. 
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. 
>> ANY CONCERN ABOUT THE 
MASSIVE VOLUME OF THE DEATH 
TOLL THERE? 
>> THE ADMINISTRATION CAME OUT 
IN SUPPORT OF THE BAKERS 
FREEDOMOF EXPRESSION IN THE 
SUPREME COURT CASE. 
WHY ARE ATHLETES RIGHTS TO 
EXPRESS THEMSELVES. 
>> WITH WHETHER IT COMES TO THE 
BAKERS WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE 
DECISION. 
IT PREVENTS THE GOVERNMENT 
DISCRIMINATING ON RELIGIOUS 
BELIEFS. 
AND THEY FOUND THAT THE 
COMMISSION FAIL TODAY SHOW 
TOLERANCE AND RESPECT FOR HIS 
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. 
IN THIS CASE AND OTHERS THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL 
CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND 
THE FREE SPEECH AND RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. 
>> I GUESS MY QUESTION IS 
SIMPLE. 
IF THE WHITE HOUSE SUPPORTS THE 
BAKER'S RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH, 
WHY DOESN'T THE WHITE HOUSE 
SUPPORT THE PLAYERS RIGHT TO 
FLEE SPEECH. 
>> THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T THINK 
THIS IS AN ISSUE OF FREE 
SPEECH. 
HE THINKS IT IS ABOUT 
RESPECTING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF 
OUR MILITARY. 
IT IS ABOUT RESPECTING OUR 
NATIONAL ANTHEM AND STANDING IN 
PRIDE FOR THEM. 
I WILL TAKE ONE LAST QUESTION. 
>> WILL HE -- WILL THE 
PRESIDENT -- IF IT IS ABOUT 
FREE SPEECH AND HE SUPPORTS 
THESE IDEAS. 
WILL HE COMMIT TO A ROUND TABLE 
WITH AMERICA'S ATHLETES ON 
TOPICS OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE. 
>> I WOULD CERTAINLY BE HAPPY 
TO ASK HIM. 
>> HAS HE -- IS IT NOT 
SOMETHING THAT HAS HAD ANY 
DISCUSSION TO THIS POINT GIVEN 
THE DIVISION IN THE COUNTRY 
OVER SOCIAL INJUSTICE. 
>> WE LOOK AT WAYS EVERY SINGLE 
WAY TO UNIFY OUR COUNTRY. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS WORKED 
ACTIVELY AND TIRELESSLY TO BE 
THE PRESIDENT OF ALL AMERICANS. 
I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT 
REFLECTED IN THE POLICIES THAT 
HE HAS PUT FORTH. 
I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
THINGS COME OUT OF THIS 
ADMINISTRATION FRANKLY THAT IS 
FAR AND VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS IS 
PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL 
AMERICANS. 
PROVIDE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD 
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS WORKED 
INCREASINGLY HARD TO MAKE SURE 
THAT HAPPENS. 
KEVIN SPOKE ABOUT THAT EARLIER. 
HE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO 
THAT. 
I WILL TAKE ONE LAST QUESTION. 
>>> STEVEN. 
>> IS THE PRESIDENT -- 
>> SORRY. 
STEVEN GO AHEAD. 
>> THIS IS NOT ABOUT 
DISRESPECTING THE FLAG. 
IS THE PRESIDENT AWARE OF. 
>> I KNOW YOU WANT TO GO TO 
STEVEN BUT I'M ASKING, THERE IS 
AN UNDERLYING ISSUE AND IT 
GROWS ABOUT DISRESPECT OF THE 
FLAG AND SOLDIERS. 
THERE ARE BLACK AND BROWN 
SOLDIERS THAT FIGHT IN THE 
MILITARY AS WELL THAT FEEL 
TAKING THE KNEE, BRINGING THE 
ATTENTION TO POLICE INVOLVED 
SHOOTINGS IS SOMETHING THAT THE 
WHITE HOUSE SHOULD DEAL WITH. 
IS THE PRESIDENT AWARE THAT 
TAKING THE KNEE IS ABOUT POLICE 
INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS 
POSITION CRYSTAL CLEAR. 
AND THAT IT IS -- I LET YOU 
RUDELY INTERRUPT ME AND YOUR 
COLLEAGUE. 
>> I'M SORRY. 
>> I'M GOING TO ASK THAT YOU 
ALLOW ME TO FINISH MY ANSWER. 
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER IT 
IF YOU STOP TALKING LONG ENOUGH 
TO LET ME DO THAT. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS 
POSITION CRYSTAL CLEAR ON THIS 
TOPIC. 
HE FEELS STRONGLY THAT STANDING 
FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM IS 
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DO. 
SOMETHING THAT MATTERS TO WHAT 
MAKES OUR COUNTRY SPECIAL AND 
UNIQUE AND WHAT SETS US APART. 
HE'S NOT GOING TO WAIVER ON 
THAT. 
HE IS NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE 
FOR IT. 
AND FRANKLY MORE THAN 70% OF 
AMERICANS AGREE WITH HIM ON 
THAT MATTER. 
IF YOU GO BACK TO WHAT THE 
ORIGIN TENT WAS, THIS HAS BEEN 
MADE A POLITICAL ARGUMENT OF 
WHICH THE PRESIDENT IS NOT 
GOING TO BACK DOWN FROM AND HE 
HAS BEEN CLEAR ON IT. 
STEVEN, LAST QUESTION. 
APRIL, I'VE ADDRESSED YOUR 
QUESTION. 
I'M NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
ENGAGE WITH YOU. 
STEVEN. 
>> NOW TELLING PEOPLE THEY HAVE 
TO STAND. 
WILL THE PRESIDENT DEAL WITH 
THE ISSUE OF POLICE INVOLVED 
SHOOTINGS. 
>> I'M GOING TO DEAL WITH THE 
ISSUE OF ADDRESSING YOUR 
COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION. 
>> CAN YOU TAKE IT TO THE 
PRESIDENT AND COME BACK TO US. 
>> I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO YIELD TO 
A COLLEAGUE. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SCOTT 
FRUIT. 
THE TWO WHO REPRESENT IOWA HAVE 
HAD IT. 
PRUITT HAS BETRAYED THE 
PRESIDENT. 
EARN SAYS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 
AS SWAMPY AS YOU CAN GET. 
NEW ELEMENTS OF HOW SWAMPY THAT 
IS. 
HOW IS IT IN THE FACE OF ALL 
THAT WE HAVE LEARNED, HOW IS 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CONTINUES 
TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE EPA 
ADMINISTRATIONOR, ASSUMING HE 
DOES. 
>> I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO 
TALK TO THE PRESIDENT ABOUT THE 
"WASHINGTON POST" NEW REPORT. 
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE NEW 
CONCERNS AND WILL ADDRESS THEM. 
THANKS, GUYS. 
>> WHAT COLOR IS THE SKY IN THE 
PRESIDENT'S WORLD? 
>> OKAY. 
A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH THERE 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS 
BRIEFING WITH SARAH HUCKABEE 
SANDERS. 
WHITE HOUSE BLAMING THE EAGLES 
FRANCHISE FOR A POLITICAL STUNT 
AS INFORM WHY THE SUPER BOWL 
CHAMPIONS WHO WERE SUPPOSE 
TODAY MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT 
IN THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY, WHY 
THAT WAS CANCELED. 
THERE WILL BE A CELEBRATION OF 
AMERICA EVENT. 
THAT WILL BE REPLACING THE 
EXPECTED, WHICH WAS CANCELED, 
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES VISIT. 
ALSO FOLLOWING INTERESTING NEWS 
OUT OF THE BACK AND FORTH. 
WHO DRAFTED AND DICTATED A 
STATEMENT BY DON JUNIOR, 
TALKING ABOUT A RUSSIAN 
ATTORNEY IN JUNE OF 2016 WHO 
MET WITH THE PRESIDENT'S SON-IN-
LAW AND THE PRESIDENT'S SON. 
WILL THAT STATEMENT ACCORDING 
TO THE NEW YORK TIMES, THEY'RE 
SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT'S 
ATTORNEY SAY THAT THAT 
STATEMENT WAS DICTATED BY THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF. 
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS 
WOULDN'T, DESPITE A LOT OF BACK 
AND FORTH WITH THE WHITE HOUSE 
PRESS CORPS OVER THAT, WOULD 
NOT MANAGE TO TAKE THE BAIT ON 
THAT, CLARIFYING BY SAYING SHE 
THINKS SHE HAS BETTER 
CREDIBILITY WITH THE AMERICAN 
PUBLIC THAN THE MEDIA DOES AT 
THIS POINT. 
A LOT OF FOLKS -- ONE WHITE 
HOUSE PRESS MEMBER CALLS JEFF 
SESSIONS THE PRESIDENT'S 
FAVORITE PIÑATA. 
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH SESSIONS 
AND THE BACK AND FORTH WHO SOME 
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT STILL NEEDS TO PUSH 
FORWARD HIS PLATFORM ON 
IMMIGRATION. 
SO BOTTOM LINE, WAS THE SUPER 
BOWL EVENT, THE CANCELING OF 
THE SUPER BOWL BY THE PRESIDENT 
A POLITICAL STUNT? 
I WANT TO BRING IN CBS NEWS 
WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT PAULA 
REID. 
A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH ON THE 
EAGLES CANCELLATION. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT. 
>> IT WAS A VERY HEATED 
BRIEFING HERE AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS 
DEFENDING HERSELF AND THE 
PRESIDENT AND WHETHER OR NOT 
BOTH OF THEM ARE BEING HONEST. 
SARAH SANDERS HAD TO DEFEND 
HERSELF ON MISLEADING 
STATEMENTS SHE MADE ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT'S ROLE ABOUT A 
MISLEADING STATEMENT ABOUT HIS 
SON'S INVOLVEMENT IN A 2016 
MEETING AT TRUMP TOWER WITH A 
GROUP OF RUSSIANS. 
NOW, WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE 
PRESIDENT'S SPECIAL COUNSEL 
ATTORNEYS THAT THE PRESIDENT 
ACTUALLY DICTATED THAT 
STATEMENT. 
SO TODAY SARAH SANDERS FACED A 
LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY SHE 
MISLEAD REPORTS AND THE PUBLIC 
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S ROLE. 
SHE REPEATEDLY DEFLECTED AND 
REFERRED TO OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND 
ACCUSED REPORTERS OF ENGAGING 
HER IN A DIALOGUE. 
THERE WERE MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT 
HER AND GOING FORWARD. 
>> WE HAVE A LIVE LOOK AT THE 
CELEBRATION OF AMERICA. 
WE'RE STANDING BY FOR THAT 
EVENT AS WELL. 
YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE IT WAS JOHN 
ROBERTS FROM FOX NEWS WHO ASKED 
A QUESTION ABOUT THE FACT THAT 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT 
TOOK A STICK WAS HIS WORDS TO 
HIS FAVORITE PIÑATA JEFF 
SESSIONS. 
WHY DOES THE PRESIDENT KEEP 
BRINGING HIM UP. 
>> IT IS A GREAT QUESTION. 
PEOPLE THINK THAT HE IS FORCING 
HIM TO RESIGN BECAUSE LEGALLY 
THE PRESIDENT CAN'T FIRE THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
LEGALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE 
RUSSIA PROBE IS LOOKING INTO 
POSSIBLE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE 
BY THE PRESIDENT AND PEOPLE IN 
THE INNER CIRCLE THE OPTICS WON 
BE GREAT IF HE WAS TO FIRED HIS 
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO HE HAS 
REPEATEDLY PUBLICLY CRITICIZED 
FOR RECUSING HIMSELF IN THE 
RUSSIA PROBE. 
POLITICALLY WE HAVE TO REMEMBER 
THAT SESSIONS HAS DAY IN AND 
DAY OUT TRIED TO DELIVER ON THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN PROMISES 
SPECIFICALLY RELATE TODAY 
IMMIGRATION. 
LEGALLY AND POLITICALLY HE 
CAN'T FIRE HIS ATTORNEY 
GENERAL. 
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THESE 
TAUNTS, TWEETS, INSULTS ARE 
PART OF AN EFFORT TO FORCE HIM 
TO RESIGN. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE 
ATTORNEY GENERALIS NOT GOING 
ANYWHERE. 
HE IS COMFORTABLE IN HIS JOB. 
HE IS AT THIS POINT NOT REALLY 
PHASED BY ANY OF THE INSULTS 
AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORKDAY IN 
AND DAY OUT TO IMPLEMENT 
POLICIES THAT HE HAS BEEN A 
CHAMPION FOR IN THE SENATE FOR 
DECADES. 
HE CAN UNILATERALLY IMPLEMENT 
AS ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
>> SPEAKING ON THE MUELLER 
PROBE. 
WE ARE HEARING ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF WITNESS úTAMPERI 
I PA APOLOGIZE, PAULA. 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT IS 
TAKING THE PODIUM. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. 
WE RESPECT OUR FLAG AND WE 
ALWAYS PROUDLY STAND FOR THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
WE WILL ALWAYS STAND FOR THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO 
WELCOME EVERYONE TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE FOR THIS PATRIOTIC 
CELEBRATION. 
BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL DAY AND A 
BEAUTIFUL CELEBRATION. 
I WANT TO THANK OUR GREAT VICE 
PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE, THANK 
YOU, MIKE, FOR JOINING US, 
ALONG WITH SECRETARY STEVEN 
MNUCHIN, SECRETARY RYAN ZINKE, 
REPRESENT LIEU BARLETTER. 
HOPEFULLY HE WILL BE YOUR NEXT 
SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
IT IS A GREAT STATE. 
REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY. 
THANK YOU, MIKE. 
GREAT TO SEE YOU. 
I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY 
TO EXPLAIN WHY YOUNG AMERICANS 
STAND FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
MAYBE IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT WE 
UNDERSTOOD. 
WE STAND TO HONOR OUR MILITARY 
AND TO HONOR OUR COUNTRY AND TO 
REMEMBER THE FALLEN HEROES WHO 
NEVER MADE IT BACK HOME. 
WE STAND TO SHOW OUR LOVE FOR 
OUR FELLOW CITIZENS AND OUR 
MAGNIFICENT CONSTITUTION. 
WE STAND TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE 
INCREDIBLE AMERICANS WHO CAME 
BEFORE US AND THE HEROIC 
SACRIFICES THEY MADE. 
AMERICA IS A GREAT NATION. 
A COMMUNITY OF FAMILY. 
AND AMERICA IS OUR HOME. 
AND WE LOVE OUR HOME. 
AND OUR COUNTRY HAS NEVER DONE 
BETTER THAN IT IS DOING RIGHT 
NOW. 
NEVER. 
RECORD NUMBERS AT EVERY 
OUTPOST. 
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS 
GOING ON. 
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS 
WE'VE HAD. 
LOWEST AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE HISTORY OF 
OUR COUNTRY. 
LOWEST HISPANIC NUMBERS IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
LOWEST NUMBERS FOR WOMEN IN 21 
YEARS. 
WE'VE CREATED 7 TRILLION 
DOLLARS OF VALUE IN OUR COUNTRY 
SINCE THE ELECTION. 
WITH THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE 
WORLD AND GETTING A LOT LARGER 
AND FAST. 
IT HAS HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY. 
ACTUALLY QUICKER THAN I EVEN 
THOUGHT. 
WE'RE DOING GREAT. 
AND ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE 
HONOR, MANY OF THEM ARE LOOKING 
DOWN RIGHT NOW, SOME OF THEM 
ARE RIGHT HERE, BUT MANY OF 
THEM ARE LOOKING DOWN RIGHT NOW 
AT OUR COUNTRY AND THEY ARE 
PROUD. 
THEY ARE VERY, VERY PROUD. 
SO WE STAND TOGETHER FOR 
FREEDOM. 
WE STAND TOGETHER FOR 
PATRIOTISM. 
AND WE PROUDLY STAND FOR OUR 
GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. 
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR 
BEING HERE. 
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL BIG 
CELEBRATION. 
ACTUALLY TO BE HONEST, IT IS 
EVEN BIGGER THAN WE HAD 
ANTICIPATED. 
SO I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. 
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
