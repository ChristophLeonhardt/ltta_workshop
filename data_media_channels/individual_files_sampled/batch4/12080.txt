give me a take on on Trump you know all I hear and we played a clip the other day a montage of people calling him racist right ah what do you think I'm beyond pleased you're beyond plead beyond pleased but better than I ever thought he would do I'm not happy with some of the protectionist stuff that he's doing but I think it's a negotiating ploy I think he's gonna want to keep them up hopefully he'll it'll cause our allies to drop their tariffs against us as well we have tariffs also that we that we use we protect milk and sugar less everybody who are allies drop all of our tariffs that probably my only quarrel with him outside of that what the left has underestimated when they when they talk about him having a cult of personality I hear that this morning on CNN bob Corker have said that's almost a cult what it is is finally a Republican is standing up against the media I can't tell you how much this is resonating with people yeah you know the New York Times has never has n't hasn't endorsed Republican president since 1956 the Washington Post has never endorsed Republican president only 7% of people in the media is according to a Pew Research defines themselves as Republican 93 percent calls themselves something else we are overwhelmingly left-wing in the media and every idea that Republicans have get smashed every Republican president in my lifetime has been called a bigot Ronald Reagan was called one Maxine Waters called George Herbert Walker Bush the good Bush erase this w was called a race of course Trump is called a racist and the media allows people to get away with it why is it that al Sharpton is even viable why'd he have a show on MSNBC yeah the guy who falsely accused a white man of raping a black teenage and they're apologized they got him on tape an FBI tape talking about a cocaine deal he old five million dollars in taxes he referred to the black mayor of New York as an n-word whore I mean I it blows me away where are the media on that why is why is a a short Farrakhan enjoying a good relationship with so many members of the black Congressional Caucus there's a picture of Farrakhan with with with Obama why aren't the media calling in these Democrats out for embracing this bigot as they would if a white guy embraced David Duke I don't get it so Donald Trump is raising these double standards calling them out for the first time a president really has done that in a in a in a gutsy way he's using Twitter and Facebook he's got add up all of his Twitter Facebook fans he's got more following the New York Times Washington Post put together and he's using that power and hallelujah
