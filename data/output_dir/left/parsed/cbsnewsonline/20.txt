UP AND PAY ATTENTION.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS WILL BE
THE WORST STORM THAT CENTRAL
GEORGIA HAS SEEN IN MANY
DECADES.
IT WILL PASS THROUGH AND IMPACT
NUMEROUS COUNTIES.
HIGH WINDS KILL IMPACT THE
VEGETATION THERE.
IT WILL BRING DOWN TREES AND
POWER LINES.
THEY NEED TO BE PREPARED, NOT
ONLY FLORIDA BUT GEORGIA NEEDS
TO BE PREPARED TO SEE THE POWER
OFF FOR MULTIPLE WEEKS AS THIS
SYSTEM PUSHES THROUGH.
ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE ASPECT IS
THE RAINFALL ASSOCIATED WITH THE
STORM IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND
NORTH CAROLINA.
HOPEFULLY THE RAINFALL WILL BE
REDUCED FOR NORTH CAROLINA AND
SOUTH CAROLINA BUT AS YOU KNOW,
FLORENCE PASSED THROUGH AND SOME
RIVER BASINS HAVE YET TO RECEDE
TO NORMAL RIVER LEVELS.
ANY AMOUNT OF RAINFALL THROUGH
NORTH CAROLINA AND SOUTH
CAROLINA IS NOT WELCOMED.
UNFORTUNATELY, IT WILL BE A
REALITY.
IT WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS AS IT
PUSHES THROUGH AS WELL.
RIGHT NOW FEMA HAS NEARLY 3,000
PEOPLE IN THE FIELD.
THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL OF THE
FEDERAL PARTNERS THERE.
WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO PREPOSITION NOT ONLY INCIDENT
MANAGEMENT TEAMS AND DISASTER
MEDICAL TEAMS BUT ALSO ROTARY
AIRCRAFT READY TO GO TO SUPPORT
SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS.
WE HAVE TEAMS STAGED TO BE ABLE
TO MOVE INTO FLORIDA AND INTO
THE AREAS IMPACTED AND ALSO
GEORGIA AS WELL.
IN REGARDS TO COMMODITIES, THE
STATE OF FLORIDA HAS STRONG
CAPABILITY THAT WE ARE WORKING
HAND IN HAND WITH RIGHT NOW.
THEY HAVE STAGING AND
DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES IN
ORLANDO.
WE HAVE TEAMS AT MAXWELL AIR
FORCE FACE AS WELL AS ATLANTA
READY TO MOVE IN.
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH
GOVERNOR SCOTT.
HE IS DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO
POSITION THE STATE TO HELP HIS
CITIZENS.
LAST NIGHT, THEY MADE A VERY
GOOD MOVE BY USING THE WIRELESS
EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM TO LET
PEOPLE KNOW THAT THE STORM IS
GETTING STRONGER AND STRONGER
AND YOU NEED TO LEAVE.
THIS IS THE FINAL CALL FOR
ANYONE WHO NEEDS TO GET OUT.
TRY TO DO SO.
THOSE WHO STICK AROUND TO
EXPERIENCE STORM SURGE DON'T
TYPICALLY LIVE TO TELL ABOUT IT.
I WANT TO REITERATE IT IS A
RESPONSE EFFORT OF THE WHOLE
COMMUNITY.
IT WILL TAKE NEIGHBORS HELPING
NEIGHBORS AND CITIZENS DONATING
THEIR TIME AND MONEY TO HELP
CITIZENS RECOVER ALL THE WAY UP
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
WE ASK YOU ALWAYS TO DOWNLOAD
THE FEMA APP, GO TO
DISASTERASSISTANCE.GOVERN.
ALSO GO TO NVO.ORG IF YOU ARE
LOOKING TO VOLUNTEER AND HELP
THOSE IN NEED.
WITH THAT, I WILL PASS IT OVER
TO THOSE FROM NATIONAL
ATMOSPHERIC ASSOCIATION.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MICHAEL STRENGTHENED TO CATEGORY
4 WITH 145 MILE PER HOUR WINDS.
IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO JUST
FOCUS ON THE CORE OF THE STORM.
THIS HAS A 200 MILE WIND SPREAD
FROM THE STORM CENTER.
TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS WILL
BE POURING OUT INTO ALABAMA AND
PORTIONS OF FLORIDA.
THIS WILL BE A DEVASTATING
STORM.
WE ARE LOOKING AT FLOODING AT 9
TO 14 FEET.
THAT WILL IMPACT THE AREAS.
FORTUNATELY HIGH TIDE WILL BE
LATE TONIGHT BUT WATER AT THAT
LEVEL WILL PUSH A LOT OF
INENDATION INTO THE --
INUNDATION INTO THE COASTAL
AREAS.
IT IS LIKELY TO BE WIDESPREAD
POWER OUTAGES IN GEORGIA AND THE
THREAT FOR TORNADOES ALONG THE
TRACK OF MICHAEL.
GETTING INTO THURSDAY AND
FRIDAY, THE HEAVY RAIN THREAT
WILL PUSH INTO THE CAROLINAS.
WE ARE LOOKING AT NINE RIVERS
SPECIFICALLY IMPACTED FROM
FLORENCE THAT ARE LIKELY TO SEE
MORE FLOODING.
FORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT EXPECTED
TO STALL AND IT WILL MOVE
QUICKLY OFF SHORE.
SO THE FLOODING THAT OCCURS
SHOULD BE SHORT LIVED AND
MICHAEL WILL PULL OUT TO SEA BY
THIS WEEKEND.
>> THANK YOU.
NEXT WE HAVE CAPTAIN KALEY
BENSON WITH OUR PARTNERS FROM
THE U.S. COAST GUARD.
>> GOOD MORNING.

DIGNIFIED DEPARTURE FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT HALEY
BROUGHT UP RESIGNING SIX MONTHS

TOP OFFICIALS WERE CAUGHT OFF
GUARD INCLUDING SECRETARY POMPEO
AND JOHN BOLTEN.
THE UNITED NATIONS HAS LONG BEEN
A HOSTILE PLACE FOR THE STATE OF

LIKE THIS ONE.
THEY ARE PREPARED TO WORK 16
HOUR SHIFTS UNTIL THEY CAN GET
THE POWER BACK ON.
TALLAHASSEE IS A CITY KNOWN FOR
AND PROUD OF THE TREE CANOPY BUT
THAT WILL BE A LIABILITY DURING
A STORM LIKE MICHAEL.
THIS IS NOT THE ONLY SERVICE
PROVIDER IN THE AREA.
DUKE ENERGY ESTIMATES THAT
NEARLY 200,000 CUSTOMERS COULD
BE IMPACTED ON THE FLORIDA
PANHANDLE, ESPECIALLY ON THE
COAST WHERE THE COMPANY SAYS IT
COULD TAKE DAYS PERHAPS MORE
