00:00:01,739 --> 00:00:04,450
most experts agree that wearable tech is

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,240
the next big<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing oh and one of the</font>

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,920
biggest names in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile has the first</font>

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">modern-day SmartWatch this is Samsung's</font>

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,010
Galaxy gear

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,050
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Galaxy gear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an android-powered</font>

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,700
SmartWatch that connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,040
smartphone via bluetooth right now it

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,510
only works with samsung's new galaxy

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,000
note 3 but samsung says it will add

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,890
compatibility to other galaxy phones

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,500
soon so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it do the galaxy gear</font>

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,940
pairs with your smartphone via bluetooth

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,640
to display incoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> notifications like</font>

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,800
calls texts and emails there's a

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,720
built-in speaker and microphone so you

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,190
can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> calls from your wrist without</font>

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">pulling out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your phone hello there's</font>

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,800
also a camera on the wristband<font color="#E5E5E5"> that lets</font>

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,540
you beam photos from the gear to your

21
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,769
photo gallery on your phone

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,009
as for apps the galaxy gear comes with a

23
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:07,140
bunch of basic ones like a calendar and

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,970
weather app and while there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,950
third-party apps available like snapchat

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">Evernote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the social network path the</font>

27
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,970
app selection<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty dim right now</font>

28
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,939
there's no Twitter no gmail no Facebook

29
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,130
no Google Maps just about anything you'd

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,899
think you need on a SmartWatch simply

31
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:24,539
isn't there so is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> any good not</font>

32
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,670
exactly the galaxy gear feels incomplete

33
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,470
and it's still plagued by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

34
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,539
that can't do and what it can do it

35
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:32,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't do very well first there's</font>

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,649
notifications the gear does a good job

37
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:36,720
at showing incoming calls texts and

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,640
emails if you use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Samsung email app</font>

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,409
but not a good job<font color="#E5E5E5"> at shown you much</font>

40
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,390
else you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get an alert if you have</font>

41
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,340
new items in<font color="#E5E5E5"> gmail Facebook or Twitter</font>

42
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,860
but you can't see what they say instead

43
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,569
the gear tells you to look at your phone

44
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get the details and that completely</font>

45
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,560
defeats the purpose of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SmartWatch</font>

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,360
should be the gear should eliminate any

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,100
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out your phone every few</font>

48
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,770
minutes instead it arguably causes you

49
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,270
to pull out your phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more than</font>

50
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">before by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> constantly alerting you next</font>

51
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,069
comes to the design the gears clunky

52
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:06,960
heavy and uncomfortable to wear on your

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,729
wrist if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to wear something all</font>

54
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,860
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look good but the gear</font>

55
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,420
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the chunky shrunken down</font>

56
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,549
smartphone finally you have to manage

57
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:16,739
most settings and apps on the gear using

58
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,570
a special gear manager app on your phone

59
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,820
that means you can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> install a new</font>

60
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,410
app to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the watch without going through</font>

61
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,260
some settings on your smartphone first

62
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,459
Samsung made a big bet by being the

63
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:27,810
first to market with a modern-day

64
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,700
SmartWatch but considering that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

65
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,410
galaxy gear<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs three hundred dollars</font>

66
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,810
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> works with one specific model of a</font>

67
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,910
samsung phone and can't do a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

68
00:02:35,910 --> 00:00:00,000
this is one device no one should buy
