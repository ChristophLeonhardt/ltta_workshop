well he's elected to run the country had the US government speak for the American people yet he gives the impression of a guy alone someone living remotely even from his own staff the very cab that he appointed this is the world of Donald Trump we know him from his tweets rather than his executive leadership as if he's lady living upstairs at the White House all alone tweeting from his bedroom while strangers run things downstairs and then the government agencies good evening I'm Chris Matthews I'm Washington after months of inaction and equivocation from the president his top intelligence and national security officials gathered before the cameras yesterday there they are the issue is strong an unambiguous message Russia is targeting the United States and our very democracy is at stake what appeared that for the first time in nineteen months the Trump administration was finally speaking with one voice well actually it's not just six hours after that press conference yesterday president Trump proceeded to undercut their warnings calling it all a hoax while boasting of his personal relationship with Vladimir Putin the dissonance the distinction the difference between the president and his administration couldn't have been clearer we continue to see a pervasive messaging messaging campaign by Russia to try to weaken and divide the United States we had a great meeting with Russia we had a great meeting with Putin this is a threat we need to take extremely seriously let me tell you if I did go up and start screaming they would have said he was terrible the Russians have to stop doing what they're doing if I get along with Vladimir Putin that's a good thing folks this threat is not going away we got along really well our democracy itself is in the crosshairs now we're being hindered by the Russian hopes it's a hoax okay as NBC News points out the two events created a split screen affect America's intelligence experts warning voters that Russia's tried to undermine democracy while Trump tells them it's all political chicanery and again highlighted the president's apparent unwillingness to hold Putin accountable the cyber warfare that Russia launched in 2016 and continues to wage against our country and despite all the evidence of Russia's influence campaign to help trump the president said that Putin was unhappy he won I'll tell you what Russia's very unhappy that Trump won that a kid says well that's a far cry from what Putin himself said back in Helsinki last month President Putin did you want president Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that yes I did because he talked about bringing the right us-russia relationship back to normal national security Directorate third way Michael Schmitt a reporter for The New York Times Jonathan Muir a White House reporter with The Associated Press and Malcom Nance and M MSNBC analyst and author of the plot to destroy democracy first of the reporters Michael and then John what do we make of this I mean factually it isn't that what's going on this split screen well I guess they had no choice they had to show that they were doing something because it left them exposed to these critics who says look you are actually not doing anything you're not taking this threat seriously so by putting them out there they have sort of an official way of saying look this is a real thing that is on our radar the president obviously is still able to go out and say what he wants despite that John Jonathan the White House briefing room was too brief the country what the White House thinks what the president thinks Sarah Huckabee Center said that very clear to a constant the other day I speak here for the president they arranged this press conference in the White House to speak for the White House and it said we have a threat from the Russians we had an attack from the Russians and 2016 we're getting it again and then the president goes out who is the president says no such thing it's a hoax yeah it's a remarkable split Chris it's another example of the president versus the presidency where you did you saw this show of force in the briefing room yesterday finally people would say overdue show of force they're trying to warn Americans about Russia's continuing election era clearance and dude this is trying to outline some steps on how to stop that then just hours later at a rally in Pennsylvania I was there the president you've made no mention of that whatsoever except to call it a hoax and then instead spent the majority of his time in that rally delivering a screed against the media complaints against the press using fake news as a term not to say this story is not true but simply uses as a blanket term for coverage he didn't like and in particular on Russia how the media covered the Helsinki summit which let's remember the president right then and there was given an opportunity to publicly with the world watching denounced what Russia did to tell them not to do it again and he didn't do it well who told those two people like the head of the National Intelligence dan coates or the CIA director or the FBI director ray who told them the winner the White House press room stand there with Sarah Huckabee the president's spokesperson and say the opposite of what the president said did he tell them to say the opposite that the Russians really did screw with us in 16 that are doing it again did he tell them to do that who did it was that the president nothing in the White House happens of course not the president giving an okay to it but what you're seeing here is he takes and you laid it out well at the beginning of the show here he charts his own path he goes it alone he is going to say what he feels whether it's on Twitter or at a rally and in terms of collusion he can't the idea of rushing interference I should say he can't separate the idea between the Muller probe and the accusations of collusion and just that Moscow tried to interfere on his behalf and he thinks that giving credence to that idea giving credence to the idea that Russia was trying to interfere deed legitimizes his victory and makes him an illegitimate president and we see time and time again how that revs him up and how he unleashes we saw it last night in Pennsylvania let's try one more time with Michael the New York Times did he tell those people go into the White House press room yesterday and say the Russians did what they did and then they went out and said they didn't I mean this is wacky I can't believe I don't people see this is why I can't believe it was his idea I find it hard to believe it was his idea that would not be conclusive grown-up they came up with the idea that briefing a stability I mean I think time and time again it goes back to Kelly well I would say convention while US officials intelligence officials announced they're taking steps to combat the threat of Russian interference the president still is unwilling to lead that effort which Oh totally hinders our ability to tell Russian aggression as cybersecurity experts tell the New York Times to deter Russia Moscow needs to believe that the United States will impose costs beyond the sanctions already and other punishments that has doled out and that requires mr. Trump to make clear he will act against interference mica so I think that when you ask about who's the grown-up in the room what we saw yesterday is it's the vice president who's actually still saying this is a threat and we need to do something he's on a different page than the president he's on the same page with the intelligence officials so if there's anyone else who's saying hey go into the room we could see that but at the same time we're bleeding expertise out of the FBI on cybersecurity they're all walking out the door Malcolm put it together have you ever seen a CEO who tells that one message to be put out officially and then delivers the opposite message within six hours on purpose well yes and the last person that I saw do that was Saddam Hussein he would always come out with these insane statements and then he would wait to see if his little Politburo would back him up and and try to get anyone who was in opposition I think what we saw here with Donald Trump is that he with Mike Pence just decided to stage a Potemkin village event and allow them to cover their butts so to speak by coming out and in doing what Michael Kelly wanted them to do which was to make a statement to the nation that they're on top of it I think he has no intention whatsoever of allowing them to go any further than that press conference and the basic standards that each agency would do as a matter of course I think like Michael said that this gives him a measure of legitimacy if he recognizes any of this as as as decent or legitimate hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
