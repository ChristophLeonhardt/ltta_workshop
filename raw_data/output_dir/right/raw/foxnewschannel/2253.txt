HERE'S OUR OPENING MONOLOGUE.

6
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:12,827
APPEASEMENT NEVER WORKS.

7
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:15,029
TONIGHT, WE HAVE ANOTHER

8
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:15,430
REMINDER.

9
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,231
THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER

10
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:16,865
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS NOW

11
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:18,366
SOUNDING THE ALARM AND AS PER

12
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:21,336
USUAL, THE PRIME MINISTER HAS

13
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:21,870
PURE MORAL CLARITY.

14
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,005
I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS.

15
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:25,306
NOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS

16
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:26,774
REVEALING ACCORDING TO THOUSANDS

17
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,244
OF PAGES OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS

18
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:29,878
OBTAINED BY INTELLIGENCE

19
00:00:29,878 --> 00:00:32,447
SOURCES, IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM

20
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:34,415
AS ALIVE AND WELL.

21
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:35,850
THE IRANIANS CALL IT PROJECT A

22
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,651
MOD.

23
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:39,320
IT IS SECRET, ILLICIT, IT IS AN

24
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,456
ONGOING SCHEME TO CONTRACT ON MY

25
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:42,090
CONSTRUCT NUCLEAR WEAPONS

26
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,525
AMENDED MEANS TO DELIVER THAT BY

27
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:45,860
INCLUDING A VERY SPECIFIC PLAN

28
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,396
TO DEVELOP FIVE WARHEADS, EACH

29
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:50,231
CONTAINING A 10-KILOTON YIELD.

30
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:52,267
HERE IS WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER

31
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:54,402
OF NONTENURE SAID ABOUT THIS

32
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:55,904
PROGRAM AND INCREDIBLE PRESS

33
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:56,504
CONFERENCE, INCREDIBLE

34
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:59,641
INTELLIGENCE EARLIER TODAY.

35
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,541
>> THIS WAS IRAN'S CHANCE TO

36
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,844
FULLY COME CLEAN.

37
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:04,012
THEY COULD TELL THE TRUTH.

38
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:07,248
THEY COULD SAY, WE HAVE THIS

39
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:08,650
PROGRAM, THIS SECRET PROGRAM,

40
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,617
IT'S OVER, IT DOESN'T EXIST, WE

41
00:01:09,617 --> 00:01:14,822
DESTROYED THEM.

42
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:15,823
HERE'S WHAT IRAN ACTUALLY TOLD

43
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:17,592
THEM.

44
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:22,430
IT SAID, IRAN DENIED THE

45
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,398
EXISTENCE OF A COORDINATE

46
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:26,634
PROGRAM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF

47
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:30,305
THE NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVE DEVICE AND

48
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:33,274
SPECIFICALLY DENIED THE

49
00:01:33,274 --> 00:01:35,543
EXISTENCE OF THE PLAN.

50
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:40,081
THE MATERIAL PROVES OTHERWISE,

51
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:44,152
THEY AUTHORIZED, INITIATED, AND

52
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:46,754
FUNDED PROJECT AMAD.

53
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:50,024
HERE'S ANOTHER DOCUMENT FROM THE

54
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:50,358
ARCHIVE.

55
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:54,629
A MASTER PLAN OF PROJECT AMAD.

56
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:55,396

57
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:56,898

00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:58,800
ENTIRE PRESENTATION, POWERPOINT,

59
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,034
WITHOUT ANY NOTES.

60
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:01,836
REMEMBER, THIS JUST COMES THREE

61
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:02,503
YEARS AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA

62
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:04,472
SIGNED OFF ON WHAT IS THE WORST

63
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:07,075
TO DEAL IN THE HISTORY OF THE

64
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:07,942
UNITED STATES, FRANKLY, THE

65
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:08,241
WORLD.

66
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:09,978
THE MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT WHERE

67
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:13,815
THE UNITED STATES AGREED TO

68
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:15,383
UNLOCK $150 BILLION ARE FROZEN

69
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:18,219
IRANIAN ASSETS AND TO SEND

70
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:19,253
ANOTHER 1.7 BILLION AND CASH

71
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:21,622
INCLUDING AN INITIAL

72
00:02:21,622 --> 00:02:23,257

73
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:24,559
LITERALLY SHIPPED AND CARGO

74
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:27,595
PLANES AND CASH AND OTHER

75
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:27,996
CURRENCIES.

76
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:28,796
SUBCRITICAL SANCTIONS WERE

77
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:29,397
LIFTED AT THE TIME.

78
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:32,433
WHAT DID WE GET IN RETURN?

79
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,702
A PROMISE FROM RADICAL ISLAMIC

80
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:36,671
MULLAHS OF IRAN THAT THEY

81
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:38,406
TEMPORARILY HALT THEIR NUCLEAR

82
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:39,207
WEAPONS PROGRAM?

83
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:40,842
THE SAME MULLAHS THAT ACTIVELY

84
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:42,410
PLAN FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF

85
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,411
ISRAEL?

86
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:44,812
THE SAME MUSCLES THAT CHANT

87
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:48,616
"DEATH TO AMERICA, DEATH TO

88
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:49,350
ISRAEL," THAT FUND TERRORISM ALL

89
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,386
OVER THE WAR THAT ARE FIGHTING

90
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:52,653
PROXY WAR AFTER PROXY WAR IN

91
00:02:52,653 --> 00:02:54,222
IRAQ AND SYRIA AND ELSEWHERE?

92
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:55,823
THE SAME MULLAHS ARE RESPONSIBLE

93
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:57,825
FOR KILLING U.S. SOLDIERS IN

94
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:59,060
IRAQ, HOLDING OTHER AMERICANS

95
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,394
HOSTAGE?

96
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:01,462
REMEMBER, OBAMA TOLD US, THIS

97
00:03:01,462 --> 00:03:03,264
WAS GOOD FOR THE WORLD?

98
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:05,299
WE WARNED YOU.

99
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:06,801
THIS AGREEMENT WAS ALWAYS A

100
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:07,101
SHAM.

101
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:08,903
NO DIFFERENT THAN WHEN NEVILLE

102
00:03:08,903 --> 00:03:10,138
CHAMBERLAIN DECLARED PEACE IN

103
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:11,906
HIS TIME AND SIGNED OFF ON A

104
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:12,974
DEAL TRYING TO APPEASE ADOLF

105
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:13,908
HITLER.

106
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:16,144
NO DIFFERENT THAN WHEN

107
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:17,378
BILL CLINTON APPEASED

108
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:18,246
KIM JONG UN'S FATHER, KIM JONG

109
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:19,514
IL, IN THE AGREEMENT CLINTON

110
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:21,015
PROMISED THIS WAS A GOOD DEAL

111
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:21,649
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

112
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:24,419
IT WILL HALT NORTH KOREA'S

113
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:25,353
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM AND

114
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:27,822
AMBITION ONCE AND FOR ALL.

115
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:29,957
IN 2015, OBAMA WANTED YOU TO

116
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:32,026
BELIEVE ONCE AGAIN, IF ONLY WE

117
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:34,362
KISSED THE RINGS OF TEST BEDS

118
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:36,464
AND RADICALS AND DICTATORS,

119
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:38,633
SOMEHOW, THEY WILL BE NICE TO

120
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:39,834
US.

121
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:42,070
FAULTY, FIELD LOGIC.

122
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,970
APPEASEMENT NEVER WORKS.

123
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,472
PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW FACES A VERY

124
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:47,075
IMPORTANT DECISION, WHETHER OR

125
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:47,875
NOT TO HOLD IRAN ACCOUNTABLE AND

126
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,710
PULL THE U.S. OUT OF THIS DEEPLY

127
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,845
FLAWED AGREEMENT.

128
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:52,480
HERE IS HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP

129
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,649
REACTED TO THIS INCREDIBLE,

130
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:57,251
BREAKING DEVELOPMENT TODAY.

131
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:59,720
>> SEVEN YEARS, THAT DEAL WILL

132
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,023
HAVE EXPIRED AND IRAN IS FREE TO

133
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:03,224
GO AHEAD AND CREATE NUCLEAR

134
00:04:03,224 --> 00:04:04,025
WEAPONS.

135
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,226
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

136
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:06,661
SEVEN YEARS IS TOMORROW.

137
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:07,595
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

138
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,464
IT'S A HORRIBLE AGREEMENT FOR

139
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:11,232
THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE

140
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:14,235
FACT, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT WE

141
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:18,805
GAVE IRAN

142
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:19,540
$150,000,000,000.1.8 BILLION IN

143
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:19,841
CASH.

144
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,742
NIGERIA WOULD LIKE SOME OF THAT.

145
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:24,846
1.8 BILLION IN CASH.

146
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:25,613
$150 BILLION.

147
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:27,381
YOU KNOW WHAT WE GOT?

148
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:29,817
WE GOT NOTHING.

149
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,819
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WOULD NOT

150
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:33,020
NEGOTIATE A NEW IDEA.

151
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,422
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

152
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:36,224
BUT I THINK IF ANYTHING, WHAT IS

153
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:37,592
HAPPENING TODAY AND WHAT HAS

154
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:38,359
HAPPENED OVER THE LAST LITTLE

155
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:42,130
WHILE AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED HAS

156
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,099
REALLY SHOWN THAT I'VE BEEN 100%

157
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:45,633
RIGHT.

158
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:47,101
>> Sean: THERE ARE MOMENTS IN

159
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:48,636
HISTORY YOU HAVE TO LEARN FROM

160
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:51,205
AND THE DEVASTATING FAILURES OF

161
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:51,739
APPEASEMENT, NEVILLE

162
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,875
CHAMBERLAIN, BILL CLINTON,

163
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,176
PRESIDENT OBAMA IN HIS WAY, IT

164
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:57,411
ALL HAS TAUGHT US, APPEASEMENT

165
00:04:57,411 --> 00:04:57,845
NEVER WORKS.

166
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:00,081
PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH DOES WORK

167
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:00,581
PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH DOES WOR

168
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:00,882
WORK.

169
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,283
THIS BRINGS US TO OUR NEXT

170
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:03,217
TOPIC.

171
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:03,885
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HISTORIC

172
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:05,386
DIPLOMATIC PROGRESS ON THE

173
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:07,588
KOREAN PENINSULA.

174
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:08,389
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO APPEASE

175
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:11,225
KIM JONG UN OR BRIBE HIM WITH

176
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:12,193
BOATLOADS OF CASH,

177
00:05:12,193 --> 00:05:14,095
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK SOME VERY

178
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:15,229
TOUGH MEASURES.

179
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:17,398
IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE

180
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:18,432
ADMINISTRATION, REMEMBER THE

181
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:19,367
PRESIDENT AND GREENISH SANCTIONS

182
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:20,835
OF THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME.

183
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:22,236
HE SENT MULTIPLE CARRIER STRIKE

184
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:23,437
GROUPS ARE THE REASON.

185
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:25,540
HE SQUEEZED HER NORTH KOREA'S

186
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,841
MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIC

187
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:28,809
PARTNER, CHINA, ALL THE WHILE

188
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,011
CALLING HIM DRUNK ON LITTLE

189
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,180

GIVE EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD A

260
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,638
SENSE OF CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM AND

261
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:39,974
SOME ARE EVEN CALLING

262
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:40,841
PRESIDENT TRUMP A

263
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:42,276
TRANSFORMATIONAL PRESIDENT.

WE'LL BRING YOU MORE ON THIS

LATER IN THE SHOW BUT FIRST, THE

268
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:48,316
DEEP STATE IS CRUMBLING RIGHT

269
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:49,750
BEFORE OUR EYES.

270
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,819
NEARLY FIVE YEARS AGO, THE

271
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,754
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR

272
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:54,955
JAMES CLAPPER, REMEMBER, HE

273
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:56,490
BLATANTLY PERJURED HIMSELF IN

274
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,759
FRONT OF CONGRESS?

275
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,127
YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS MOMENT.

276
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:01,362
>> DOES THE NSA COLLECT ANY TYPE

277
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:04,999
OF DATA AT ALL ON MILLIONS OR

278
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:06,934
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

279
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:07,335
AMERICANS?

280
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:09,470
>> NO, SIR.

281
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,273
>> IT DOES NOT?

282
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:14,975
>> NOT WITTINGLY.

283
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:18,713
THERE ARE CASES WHERE THEY COULD

284
00:08:18,713 --> 00:08:21,382
INADVERTENTLY, PERHAPS COLLECT,

285
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:22,383
BUT NOT WITTINGLY.

286
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:23,818
>> Sean: OF COURSE, A SHORT

287
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:26,253
TIME LATER, WE LEARNED THE NSA

288
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:26,821
WAS COLLECTING DATA.

289
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:28,589
CLAPPER KNEW IT AND HE LIED.

290
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:30,024
HE WAS NEVER CHARGED LIKE

291
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:31,192
GENERAL FLYNN WITH LYING.

292
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:32,426
THIS CASE, PERJURY.

293
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:34,794
NOW CLAPPER HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN

294
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:35,796
YET ANOTHER BOLD FACE LIE.

295
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:37,030
ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE

296
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,533
HOUSE AND TELL COMMITTEE DURING

297
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,235
A CLOSED-DOOR HEARING,

298
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:42,669
CLAPPER FLATLY DENIED EVER

299
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,038
DISCUSSING THAT PHONY CLINTON

300
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:45,639
BOUGHT AND PAID FOR STEEL

301
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,841
RUSSIAN DOSSIER WITH A MEMBER OF

302
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:47,875
THE MEDIA.

303
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,877
HE ALSO REPEATED THIS CLAIM IN

304
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:51,712
MARCH DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH

305
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:53,114
DON LEMON AT CNN.

306
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:54,682
TAKE A LOOK.

307
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:56,317
>> I DO NOT HAVE ANY CONTACT

308
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:57,385
WITH MEDIA UNTIL AFTER I LEFT

309
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:58,819
THE GOVERNMENT ON THE 20TH OF

310
00:08:58,819 --> 00:08:59,153
JANUARY.

311
00:08:59,153 --> 00:09:01,922
SO I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT

312
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:05,459
I READ THAT SOMEHOW I LEAKED

313
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,027
ABOUT THE DOSSIER.

314
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:09,597
>> YOU DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING

315
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:10,998
ABOUT THE DOSSIER TO ANYBODY?

316
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:11,365
>> NO.

317
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:13,100
I MEAN, I TALKED ABOUT IT AFTER

318
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,370
I LEFT THE GOVERNMENT.

319
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,407
BUT NOT DURING THAT PERIOD AND

320
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:20,641
CERTAINLY NOT BETWEEN THE SIXTH

321
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,376
OF JANUARY AND THE TENTH WHEN

322
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:23,577
THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HIMSELF

323
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:24,211
TALKED ABOUT IT.

324
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:25,179
>> Sean: AN INCREDIBLE

325
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:25,579
DEVELOPMENT.

326
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:27,381
THE INTEL COMMITTEE'S REPORT

327
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,016
FOUND THAT CLAPPER "ADMITTED TO

328
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:30,618
THE HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT

329
00:09:30,618 --> 00:09:32,119
COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE AND

330
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:33,554

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,192
EARLY JANUARY 2017."

333
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:40,227
THIS WAS SHORTLY BEFORE TRUMP'S

334
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:41,162
INAUGURATION.

335
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:43,230

DOSSIER.

341
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:50,838
A SHORT TIME LATER,

342
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:52,039
JAMES CLAPPER, OH, HE'S HIRED BY

343
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,408
FAKE NEWS CNN AS AN ANALYST.

344
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:55,643
YOU CONNECT THE DOTS.

345
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:56,577
PRESIDENT TRUMP REACTED ON

00:09:56,577 --> 00:10:04,618
TWITTER, WRITING...

347
00:10:04,618 --> 00:10:06,587

LEGAL JEOPARDY OVER THIS BLATANT

349
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:10,191
PERJURY TO CONGRESS, IT WILL BE

350
00:10:10,191 --> 00:10:11,826
YET ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF WHAT I

351
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:13,594
SAY IS OUR TWO TIERED SYSTEM OF

352
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:13,928
JUSTICE.

353
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:15,663
HE'LL GO WITH THE

354
00:10:15,663 --> 00:10:16,964
HILLARY CLINTON SYSTEM OF

355
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:17,298

LET'S TURN TO THE MAINSTREAM

357
00:10:18,432 --> 00:10:18,732
MEDIA.

358
00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:21,602
IF YOU THOUGHT THEY COULDN'T GET

359
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:23,370
ANY MORE ANTI-TRUMP OR DOWNRIGHT

360
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,538
VULGAR, THINK AGAIN.

361
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:27,208
THEY OUTED THEMSELVES OVER THE

I AM SO PROUD I HAVE NEVER BEEN,

367
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:34,782
WHERE THEY TAKE SOME TIME TO

369
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:38,018

PEOPLE, JUST LIKE HE DID LAST

378
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:48,362
YEAR.

379
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:50,364
GOOD CHOICE.

380
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:53,501
>> BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY, BY

381
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:56,337
THE WAY, IS THIS BETTER THAN

382
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:59,206
THAT PHONY WASHINGTON

383
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:00,441
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS

384
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:00,774
DINNER?

385
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:05,746
IS THIS MORE FUN?

386
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:07,581
I COULD BE UP THERE TONIGHT

387
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:09,984
SMILING LIKE I LOVE WHEN THEY

388
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:11,352
ARE HITTING YOU COME I SHOT

389
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:12,820
AFTER SHOT, THESE PEOPLE, THEY

390
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:18,759
HATE YOUR GUTS, SHOT.

391
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,995
AND YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO SMILE.

392
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,396
AND IF YOU DON'T SMILE, THEY

393
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:24,198
WILL SAY, HE WAS TERRIBLE, HE

394
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:25,599
COULDN'T TAKE A HIT, AND IF YOU

395
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,601
DO SMILE, THEY WILL SAY, WHAT

396
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,203
DID HE SMILE ABOUT?

397
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:31,005
THERE IS NO WINNING.

398
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:31,972
>> Sean: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

399
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:32,673
DESCRIPTION, ALL TOO ACCURATE.

400
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:35,409
THIS YEAR'S SHOW FEATURED SUCH

401
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:37,244
SO-CALLED COMEDIAN, FORMER DAILY

402
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:39,780
SHOW CONTRIBUTOR, NEVER HEARD OF

403
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,683
HER BEFORE, MICHELLE WOLF,

404
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:44,785
DELIVERING A PERFORMANCE THAT IS

405
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:45,953
SO VILE, ONE-SIDED,

406
00:11:45,953 --> 00:11:47,121
CRINGEWORTHY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO

407
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:48,188
COVER YOUR EARS OF IO KIDS IN

408
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:49,590
THE LIVING ROOM.

409
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,992
>> MIKE PENCE IS ALSO VERY

410
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:52,593
ANTICHOICE.

411
00:11:52,593 --> 00:11:54,762
HE THINKS ABORTION IS MURDER.

412
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:56,196
WHICH, FIRST OF ALL, DON'T KNOCK

413
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:57,765
IT TILL YOU TRY IT.

414
00:11:57,765 --> 00:11:59,633
AND WHEN YOU DO TRY IT, REALLY

415
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:00,401
KNOCK IT.

416
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:02,770
YOU KNOW IT, YOU GOT TO GET THAT

417
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,971
BABY OUT OF THERE.

418
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:05,205
YOU GUYS GOTTA STOP PUTTING

419
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:06,607
KELLYANNE ON YOUR SHOW.

420
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:07,808
ALL SHE DOES IS LIE.

421
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:09,443
IF YOU DON'T GIVE HER A

422
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:11,679
PLATFORM, SHE HAS NOWHERE TO

423
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,012
LIE.

424
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:14,014
IT'S LIKE THAT OLD SAYING, IF A

425
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:17,017
TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS, HOW DO

426
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:19,587
WE GET KELLYANNE UNDER THAT

427
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:19,987
TREE?

428
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:21,121
I'M NOT SUGGESTING SHE GETS

429
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:25,125
HURT, JUST STUCK.

430
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,896
IVANKA CLAIMS        CLEANS UP N

431
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:28,929
IVANKA CLAIMS        CLEANS UP C

432
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:29,163
IVANKA CLAIMS        CLEANS UP .

433
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:29,863
SHE'S THE DIAPER GENIE OF THE

434
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:30,331
ADMINISTRATION.

435
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:32,366
ON THE OUTSIDE SHE LOOKS SWEET

436
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:34,401
BUT ON THE INSIDE, IT'S STILL

437
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:34,768
[BLEEP].

438
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:35,769
>> Sean: NOT EVEN FUNNY.

439
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,571
IF YOU THINK THAT'S BAD, SHE

440
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:39,406
SAVED HER WORST REMARKS FOR

441
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:40,107
SARAH SANDERS, WHO WAS SITTING

442
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:41,108
JUST FEET AWAY.

443
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:43,077
TAKE A LOOK.

444
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:46,413
>> AND OF COURSE, WE HAVE SARAH

445
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:48,382
HUCKABEE SANDERS, WE ARE GRACED

446
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:49,183
WITH SARAH'S PRESENCE TONIGHT.

447
00:12:49,183 --> 00:12:51,986
I HAVE TO SAY, I AM A LITTLE

448
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:52,753
STARSTRUCK.

449
00:12:52,753 --> 00:12:54,955
I LOVE YOU AS AUNT LYDIA AND

450
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:58,158
"THE HANDMAID'S TALE."

451
00:12:58,158 --> 00:13:00,594
I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE SARAH.

452
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:02,997
I THINK SHE'S VERY RESOURCEFUL.

453
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:04,999
LIKE, SHE BURNS FACTS AND THEN

454
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,567
SHE USES THE ASH TO CREATE A

455
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:09,603
PERFECT SMOKY EYE.

456
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:12,806
LIKE, MAYBE SHE'S BORN WITH IT.

457
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:14,375
MAYBE ITS ALLIES.

458
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,010
AND I'VE NEVER REALLY SURE WHAT

459
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:16,977
TO CALL SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS.

460
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:18,345
YOU KNOW?

461
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:19,446
IS THAT SARAH SANDERS, IS IT

462
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:22,016
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, IS IT

463
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:24,785
BECAUSE IN HUCKABEE, IS IT

464
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:25,786
ANTI-HUCKABEE SANDERS?

465
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:27,588
BUT WHAT IS UNCLE TOM BUT FOR

466
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:28,589
WHITE WOMEN WHO DISAPPOINT OTHER

467
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:29,690
WHITE WOMEN?

468
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,960
>> Sean: BY THE WAY, SARAH,

469
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,162
KELLY AND, THEY TOOK IT WITH

470
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:35,829
INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAR

471
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,963
INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAH

472
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:35,996
INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAS

473
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:36,030
INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAN

474
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,063
INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAE

475
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:36,363
INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAS

476
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:36,397
INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAR

477
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:36,430
INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAG

478
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:36,597
INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAT

479
00:13:36,597 --> 00:13:36,664
INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAE

480
00:13:36,664 --> 00:13:36,964
INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SA.

481
00:13:36,964 --> 00:13:41,235
A SO-CALLED PERFORMANCE WAS SO

482
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:43,137
ASSOCIATION'S PRESIDENT REGRETS

483
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:44,905
OVER WOLF'S REMARK AND SOME OF

484
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:46,940
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVEN THEY

485
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,608
CALLED OUT THIS SO-CALLED

486
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:47,975
COMEDIAN.

487
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:49,977
TAKE A LOOK.

488
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:52,646
>> I THINK THE COMEDIAN CROSSED

489
00:13:52,646 --> 00:13:54,682
A LINE.

490
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:57,017
THIS ONE FROM POKING FUN TO

491
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:57,951
BEING MEAN-SPIRITED.

492
00:13:57,951 --> 00:13:59,753
IT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

493
00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:01,955
I THINK THAT SARAH SANDERS

494
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:04,458
HANDLED HERSELF VERY WELL.

495
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,126
>> THE DINNER IS SUPPOSED TO BE

496
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:07,795
A JOURNALISM AND NOT THE

497
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:08,562
RED CARPET, NOT THE

498
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:09,296
MEAN-SPIRITED JOKE THAT WE SAW

499
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:10,864
LAST NIGHT, SOME OF THOSE I

500
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:11,832
REALLY THOUGHT WERE

501
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:12,266
INAPPROPRIATE.

502
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:14,468
>> THIS DINNER HAS HAD A LOT OF

503
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:15,769
BAD MOMENTS.

504
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,571
THINKING BACK, AS I WAS WATCHING

505
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:19,840
THIS CRINGEWORTHY PERFORMANCE IN

506
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,009
SOME RESPECTS GOING AFTER THE

507
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:23,110
APPEARANCE OF SARAH SANDERS,

508
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,344
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS

509
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:24,945
INAPPROPRIATE.

510
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:25,946
>> I REALLY THOUGHT THE PAIN OF

511
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:29,450
THE PEOPLE ON STAGE, WHEN SARAH

512
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,086
HUCKABEE SANDERS WAS BEING MADE

513
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:33,454
FUN OF, EVERYBODY FELT PAIN FOR

514
00:14:33,454 --> 00:14:33,787
HER.

515
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:34,988
SHE FELT PAIN.

516
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:36,156
IT REALLY BOTHERED ME.

517
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:38,158
I KNOW THERE'S A BIG CONTROVERSY

518
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:39,393
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HER

519
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:40,327
APPEARANCE WAS BEING MADE FUN OF

520
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:43,931
OR NOT, COME ON.

521
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,166
>> Sean: FOX NEWS ALERT,

522
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:46,834
HANNITY AGREES WITH MIKA.

523
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,569
JUST AS THE PRESIDENT TWEETED,

524
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,370
THIS EVENT IS NOW DEAD.

525
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,772
THE PRESIDENT IS INCREDIBLY

526
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:53,040
SMART, NOT TO DIDN'T BUY THIS

527
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,878
DINNER WITH HIS PRESENT TO

528
00:14:57,878 --> 00:15:01,181
PRESENCE.

529
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:03,183
THEY WERE PROMPTLY MOCKED

530
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:05,185
INTEGRATED, THE PRESS DESERVES

531
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:05,886
NO SUCH CONSIDERATION GOING

532
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:06,220
FORWARD.

533
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,188
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, I'LL SAY IT

534
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:09,757
AGAIN COME AT JOURNALISM IN THIS

535
00:15:09,757 --> 00:15:11,992
COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTELY DEAD.

536
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:13,594
THEY ARE NOT JOURNALISTS.

537
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:15,062
THEY ARE OPINION ADVOCACY HOSTS.

538
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:15,829
THEY DON'T ADMIT IT.

539
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:16,697
THE LAST STORY TONIGHT COMES

540
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:17,731
FROM A SOUTHERN BORDER.

541
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:19,800
FOR WEEKS, WE'VE BEEN TRACKING

542
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,968
THIS LARGE CARAVAN OF MIGRANTS

543
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:22,402
FROM SOUTH AMERICA AS THEY

544
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:23,403
MARCHED THROUGH MEXICO HEADED TO

545
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:25,973
THE U.S. BORDER.

546
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:27,174
MEXICO DOES NOTHING AND KNOW

547
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:27,908
DOZENS OF MIGRANTS HAVE ARRIVED

548
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:29,309
AT THE BORDER AND THEY ARE

549
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:31,211
DEMANDING ENTRY INTO THE U.S.

550
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:33,380
WITH SOME ATTEMPTING TO SCALE A

551
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,382
BORDER FENCE IN CALIFORNIA.

552
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:36,884
PRESIDENT TRUMP WADE AND ALSO

553
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:37,785
EARLIER TODAY.

554
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:38,385
TAKE A LOOK.

555
00:15:38,385 --> 00:15:40,387
>> WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS.

556
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:41,789
WE HAVE TO HAVE BORDERS.

557
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:43,290
WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T

558
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,191
HAVE A COUNTRY.

559
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:46,293
AND I'VE BEEN WATCHING FOR WEEKS

560
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:48,228
AS THE CARAVAN CAME UP.

561
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:49,630
AND YOU KNOW, THE MEXICAN MILES

562
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,632
ARE VERY TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION,

563
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:53,167
EXTREMELY TOUGH.

564
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,968
AND IT STARTED OUT WITH WEIGH

565
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:55,669
OVER 1,000 PEOPLE.

566
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,237
I GUESS NOW IT'S DOWN TO A

567
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:57,771
HUNDRED.

568
00:15:57,771 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU GOT TO HAVE A WALL.
