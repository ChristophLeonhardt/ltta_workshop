Now that's a jump.
It would even make Michael Jordan proud.
Look at it again, see how the abdomen curls
up as the mantis leaps?
That curl is a crucial move for a juvenile
mantis which
doesn't have any wings yet, when it launches
itself toward a target.
That's what Cambridge University researchers
found when they
analyzed the leap using high speed video.
The curled abdomen changes the center of the
jumper's mass and
it also generates just a little bit of spin.
It turns out that the mantis needs to
generate some spin first and
then correct it on the fly in order to make
an accurate jump.
That finding could be very useful for
engineers
who are now trying to figure out how to make
jumping robots not spin out of control.
Look what happens to the mantis when
glue is used to make the abdomen too stiff to
curl properly.
The mantises couldn't do it.
Sometimes they even crashed head on.
Of course, even without the glue, the
mantises weren't perfect, but then,
neither was Michael Jordan.
