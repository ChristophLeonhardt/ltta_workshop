>> Martha: I KNOW YOU HAVE A
FOUNDATION THAT YOU ARE
TRYING TO -- WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO WITH THAT
FOUNDATION?
>> WE HAVE DEDICATED SOME OF
IT FOR HIGH SCHOOL
SCHOLARSHIPS AT TIM'S HIGH
SCHOOL AND THE BULK OF IT IS
PRETTY MUCH DEDICATED TO
FUNDING PROSTHETICS TO
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD IT,
ESPECIALLY CHILDREN AND
POTENTIALLY SOLDIERS BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT TIM REALLY
WANTED TO DO WITH HIS
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
DEGREE.
>> Martha: THAT WAS
EVIDENCELY PIAZZA ON THE
STORY IN FEBRUARY.
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE
TIMOTHY J. PIAZZA FOUNDATION
SET UP.
HE DIED AFTER A NIGHT OF
HAZARDING AT PENN STATE
FRATERNITY.
THE SOPHOMORE WANTED TO BE
AN ENGINEER AND DEVELOP
PROSTHETICS.
KEEP ALIVE THROUGH THEIR
FOUNDATION.
THE PIAZZAS WERE ABLE TO PAY
FOR PROTEST SET THICK LEG
FOR 7-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO LOST
THE LOWER PART OF HIS LEG IN
A TRAGIC SCHOOL BUS
ACCIDENT.
LAMONT HANNA RECEIVED THIS
COOL BATMAN PROSTHESIS TWO
MONTHS AGO AND HIS MOM SAYS
IS HE ALREADY BACK TO BEING
A KID AGAIN.
HERE NOW LAMONT HANNA AND
HIS MOTHER LAKIA WILLIAMS.
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US
TONIGHT.
HELLO LAMONT AND HELLO
LAKIA.
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED AND
WHAT LAMONT'S REACTION WAS
AND HOW WORRIED YOU ALL WERE
ABOUT WHAT HIS FUTURE WAS
GOING TO BE LIKE.
>> WELL, HE WAS EXITING OFF
HIS BUS AND ANOTHER BUS HIT
HIM AND DURING THE ACCIDENT,
HE LOST HIS BOTTOM PART OF
THE LEG AT THE SCENE.
>> MOM, MOM, MOM.
I DIDN'T LOST MY LEG.
>> YOU DIDN'T LOSE YOUR LEG.
WELL, HE LOST HIS FOOT.
HE WANTS ME TO CORRECT.
HE LOST HIS FOOT ON THE
SCENE AND THROUGH THAT.
THE PIAZZA FAMILY, THE
FOUNDATION REACHED OUT TO US
AND THEY REWARDED LAMONT
WITH A VERY COOL BATMAN LEG.
BUT, BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, WE
WEREN'T SURE WAS HE ABLE TO
WALK AGAIN.
WILL HE BE ABLE TO WALK
AGAIN.
THAT WAS MY BIGGEST WORRY
WOULD HE BE ABLE TO WALK
AGAIN BECAUSE, TO LOSE YOUR
THAT'S THE MAIN PART OF
WALKING.
SO WE WERE.
>> HELLO, MOM?
HELLO?
HELLO, HELLO.
>> Martha: YOU CAN HEAR YOUR
MOM AND CAN YOU HEAR ME.
LAMONT, THIS QUESTION IS FOR
YOU.
OKAY.
HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU
FOUND OUT THAT YOU WERE
GOING TO GET THIS BATMAN
PROSTHETIC THAT WOULD HELP
YOU WALK AGAIN?
>> EXCITING.
>> YOU WERE EXCITED ABOUT
IT?
WAS IT HARD TO WALK WITH IT?
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
THAT.
>> I USED TO RUN, I USED TO
RUN.
>> NOW YOU CAN'T RUN AS
FAST.
>> I CAN'T RUPP AS FAST AS
MY FRIENDS.
>> OH.
NOW YOU CAN'T RUN AS FAST AS
YOUR FRIENDS?
BUT, IT'S OKAY.
BUT NOW YOU HAVE A LEG,
RIGHT?
>>
BUT WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT
IT THE MOST?
WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT YOUR
LEG THE MOST.
>> BATMAN.
>> THE BATMAN?
>> Martha: TELL ME ABOUT
MEETING THE PIAZZA FAMILY
AND HOW YOU ALL WERE
CONNECTED.
>> I WAS EXCITED AND ELATED
TO MEET HER JUST THE FACT
THAT SHE WOULD TAKE TIME OUT
TO MEET US.
AND PUT FORTH A FOUNDATION
TO HELP PEOPLE THAT SHE
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW.
SO I WAS I-I ACTUALLY
GOOGLED HER.
I WAS JUST LIKE SO EXCITED
TO MEET HER.
AND I WAS SO THANKFUL.
JUST LIKE REALLY HONESTLY
THANKFUL.
BECAUSE, WITHOUT HER, MY SON
WOULDN'T HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO WALK AGAIN.
AND I CAN NEVER REPAY HER
FOR.
THAT IS LIKE NEVER.
THAT IS LIKE --
>> Martha: THE FACT THAT,
YOU KNOW, THEY HAD SUCH A
TRAGEDY THAT HAPPENED IN
THEIR LIVES AND THAT THEY
ARE USING IT TO MAKE SOMEONE
ELSE'S LIFE, YOUR LITTLE BOY
LAMONT'S LIFE BETTER.
>> I ACTUALLY SAID A
MIRACLE.
I SAID USING THEIR TRAGEDY
TO GIVE MIRACLES.
IT'S A MIRACLE TO BE ABLE TO
GIVE SOMEONE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO BE ABLE TO WALK AGAIN:
WE TAKE FOR GRANTED TO WHERE
NOW IT'S A NECESSITY TO
WHERE I HAVE TO CARRY HIM
AROUND.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
IF HE WASN'T WE WOULD HAVE
TO CARRY HIM AROUND.
SO, IT'S A BLESSING.
>> Martha: HE IS A BLESSING.
LAMONT.
>> YES, IS HE.
>> Martha: AN ADORABLE BOY
AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I BET YOU WILL BE ABLE TO
RUN AND KEEP UP WITH YOUR
FRIENDS BEFORE YOU KNOW IT
OKAY, BUDDY?
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
