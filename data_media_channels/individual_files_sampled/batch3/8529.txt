LELAND: WELCOME BACK TO QUANTICO, VIRGINIA, HOME OF THE PLACE THAT THEY TRAIN SO MANY OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF MARINE OFFICERS HEADED OUT TO JOIN THE FLEET. ONE THING THAT HAS CHANGED SO MUCH ABOUT WARFARE ESPECIALLY IF IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN AND SYRIA IS THE USE OF MILITARY WORKING DOGS LIKE MO HERE WITH HIS HANDLER, SERGEANT RAYMOND CLEVELAND. AND SHALL WE SAY WE GOT A FIRST-HAND LOOK AT EXACTLY WHAT MO CAN DO ON THE BATTLEFIELD. HE'S ACTUALLY A PATROL WITH SUSPECT APPREHENSION AND AN EXPLOSIVE DETECTOR DOG. HE LOCATES BETWEEN 15 TO 30 DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPLOSIVES. REPORTER: YOU THINK OF THE TRAINING THAT GOES INTO A MARINE, HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO THE TRAINING THAT GOES INTO A MARINE DOG? IT'S THE SAME KIND OF TRAINING. WE'LL GET MARINES FROM BASIC MILITARY POLICE SCHOOL, RECRUIT SCHOOL, ALL THAT. THEY GO THROUGH 120 DAYS OF BASIC TRAINING AND WE GET THEM. THEY'RE VERY BASIC. ONCE WE GET THEM THEY GO THROUGH 40 HOURS A WEEK OF TRAINING UNTIL THEIR PROFICIENCY IS HIGH ENOUGH TO BE AN OPERATIONAL DOG. LELAND: TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH OF A DEPLOYMENT DOGS MAKE FOR MARINES WHEN YOU'RE OVERSEAS. IT'S PHENOMENAL. THE DOGS WITH THEIR EXPLOSIVE DETECTION ASPECT SAVE LIVES, WALK IN FRONT OF THE INFANTRY MARINES IN SOME OF THE MOST HOSTILE LOCATIONS. THE FIGHT ISN'T JUST OVERSEAS. THE FIGHT IS HERE, DOMESTIC TERRORISM, THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES. HAVING THE DOGS AT THE GATE, AT THE INSTALLATION, HAVING THAT ASSET READILY AVAILABLE TO THE INSTALLATION COMMANDER IS PHENOMENAL. LELAND: WHERE DO YOU GO FROM A DOG THAT'S OUT WITH TONS OF PEOPLE, RUNNING IN A MARATHON, AND IS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND FINE, TO THE DOG THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE RUN ME AND CHASE ME DOWN? IT'S A LIGHT SWITCH EFFECT. ONCE THAT HARNESS GOES ON THAT DOG, THAT DOG KNOWS IT'S TIME TO WORK. THE DOG WILL FLIP ON THE LIGHT SWITCH AND TAKE HIM DOWN, FLIP THE LIGHT SWITCH OFF WHEN THE SUSPECT IS APPREHENDED. LELAND: DO THE DOGS EVER LOSE THE BATTLE? NEVER. DOGS NEVER LOSE. YOU'LL SEE. YOU'LL SEE. ELIZABETH: LELAND LELAND: I SAW AND NOW YOU SAW FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT ANGLES HERE A LOT OF WHAT MO CAN DO AND OTHER MILITARY WORKING DOGS CAN DO. WE CAN'T SHOW YOU, WE CAN TELL YOU ABOUT IT, LIZ. I KNOW YOUR DOGS ARE AS WELL-TRAINED AS THIS. THEY'RE SENDING THEM OUT 500 YARDS TO SEARCH OUT I.E.D.s. NOT ONLY DO THEY FIND THE EXPLOSIVES, THEY THEN GO AND START TRACKING THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THE EXPLOSIVES THERE, WHICH IS A NEW SKILL THAT THE MILITARY IS WORKING ON TRAINING THESE DOGS FOR, JUST IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. ELIZABETH: I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LIGHT OF IT BECAUSE IT IS FASCINATING WHAT THESE ANIMALS CAN DO AND THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLE AND THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO TRAIN THEM. IF I COULD JUST WATCH THE VIDEO OF YOU GETTING TACKLED OVER AND OVER AGAIN, I DON'T WANT THIS TO COME OUT WRONG. LELAND: I THINK IT'S THE SCREEN SAVER OF A FEW OF OUR PRODUCERS. ELIZABETH: YOU DID MENTION MY DOG. I'M NOT SURE THAT MY LAB TERRIER MIXES FROM KILL SHELTERS CAN DO THE WORK THAT THEY DO, BUT IT'S INSPIRING NONETHELESS. YOU DID A GREAT JOB OUT THERE. NOT THAT I WANT TO SEE THE VIDEO OF YOU GETTING TAKEN DOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
