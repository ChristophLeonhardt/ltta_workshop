UNDER OATH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WHERE ARE WE?
IS THE STORY MOVING FORWARD
WHERE WE MIRED IN AN ANGRY X
NOT WANT TO BE IS HAVING HIS
CURRENT ATTORNEY FIRING BACK AT
HIS LONGTIME ATTORNEY.
IT'S NOT A HEALTHY SPOT FOR TEAM
TRUMP BECAUSE MICHAEL CULLEN WAS
A TRUSTED FIXER AND ATTORNEY AND
CONFIDANT FOR MANY YEARS FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP PRIOR TO HIM
BEING PRESIDENT AND IF HE HAS
DECIDED IT IS IN HIS INTEREST TO
FLIP ON TRUMP WHETHER HE'S
TELLING THE NEW TRUTHS OR
INVENTING NEW STORIES TO HELP
HIS OWN SELF, SAVE HIS OWN SKIN,
AND THAT IS A WAR OF WORDS THAT
IS NOT PARTICULARLY HELPFUL TO
GIULIANI GO ON TV AND PURSING
WHETHER CERTAIN RECORDINGS CUT
OFF AT A CERTAIN TIME AND ASKING
WHY THAT'S THE CASE, NOT A
HEALTHY SPOT.
>> Harris: 'S A OF DEVELOPMENT
TODAY THAT WE'VE SEEN, AND THAT
SOMEWHAT COMING FROM GIULIANI
AND OTHER REPORTING AND THAT IS
THERE MAY NOT BE ANY OTHER TAPES
OF THE PRESIDENT'S VOICE ON
THEM.
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF TAPES
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION HOW MANY
PEOPLE WAS HE RECORDING?
WE DON'T KNOW.
>> Kennedy: YOU DON'T KNOW.
GIULIANI IS CLEARLY TRYING TO
CAST SO MUCH DOUBT ON THE TAPES
AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE
DOCTORS AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY
TAPES, THEIR DIGITAL RECORDINGS
SINCE HE RECORDED THEM WITH HIS
PHONE, IT'S NOT LIKE HE HAD A
IT'S PRETTY EASY TO CHOP THAT
STUFF UP ON YOUR PHONE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY CNN WAS IT MORE
LOVE TO PLAY THE WORLD ANYTHING
THEY COULD DAMAGE THE PRESIDENT,
BUT WE ARE GETTING SO FAR AWAY
FROM FOCUS AND OBJECTIVITY AND
IT WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING
TO SEE, IS TALKING ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT ENOUGH TO DAMAGE HIS
REPUTATION THAT HE IS ULTIMATELY
REMOVED FROM OFFICE?
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE AIM OF MANY
YOUR SCREEN BECAUSE THAT IS THE
WHITE HOUSE AND OF COURSE, WE
ARE WAITING FOR ITALY'S
PRIME MINISTER TO JOIN OUR
HE WILL ARRIVE, THIS IS VERY
TRADITIONAL AND SO WE ALWAYS
LIKE TO CAPTURE THESE PICTURES
WITH A HAPPEN.
AS A PARTICULARLY SPECIAL AND
INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS MAN
CONTE IS SUPPOSED TO BE OR HAS
SAID TO BE THE CLOSEST ALLY
SUPPORTER OF OUR CURRENT
PRESIDENT IN EUROPE.
SO THIS WILL BE ONE TO WATCH,
THEY WILL HAVE A BILATERAL
MEETING, THEY WILL HAVE A NEWS
CONFERENCE A BIT LATER AND WE
WILL COVER IT AS IT HAPPENS HERE
ON
ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL.
SO THAT IS OFF TO THE LEFT OF
THE SCREEN AS YOU LOOK AT YOUR
TV AND I JUST WANT TO REFERENCE
THAT.
THERE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A
QUIET FROM DEMOCRATS ON THIS.
CHUCK SCHUMER IS ALWAYS OUT
THERE SAYING SOMETHING.
SITUATIONS WHERE YOU SIT BACK
AND LET THE ATTORNEYS THAT
THEMSELVES ON PROVERBIAL FIRE?
>> Adrienne: I THINK A LOT OF
BE COMING TOWARD AN END.
IF YOU HAVE SO MANY THINGS THAT
ARE CULMINATING THAT INSIST THAT
IS COMING TO AN END.
>> Harris: I HAVEN'T HEARD
DEMOCRAT SAY THAT.
>> Adrienne: THE WAY THAT HE
IS INTERVIEWING WITNESSES, THE
WAY THAT HE'S BRINGING THEM.
YOU'RE RIGHT, WE DON'T ASSUME
ANYTHING.
BUT IT WOULD NOT BE A CRAZY
ASSUMPTION TO THINK THAT THIS IS
NOT COMING TO AN END SOONER
RATHER THAN LATER.
HOWEVER, ON THIS PARTICULAR
POINT, RUDY GIULIANI IS DIGGING
HIS OWN DEATH, SO WHAT ARE THEY
WANT TO STEP INTO IT?
HE IS CONSTANTLY CONTRADICTING
HIMSELF ON TELEVISION.
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, HE CALLED
MICHAEL COHEN AN HONEST MAN.
>> Harris: HE DID NOT KNOW
ABOUT THIS TAPE AND THAT'S WHAT
HE'S BEEN SAYING.
>> Adrienne: NOW HE'S
DISPARAGING THE CREDIBILITY OF
THE TAPE.
I THINK THE LAST PERSON WHO
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS CURRENT
ATTORNEY WOULD WANT TO CRITICIZE
IS MICHAEL CULLEN.
MICHAEL COHEN KNOWS A LOT.
IT'S BEEN HIS ATTORNEY FOR
YEARS.
>> Kennedy: THEY WERE SO
TERRIFIED AND OBVIOUSLY THE
PRESIDENT AND HIS ASSOCIATES
KNOW THE CONTENT OF THE MEETINGS
YOU WOULD COME UP WITH RADIO
SILENCE.
NOT NECESSARILY FROM DEMOCRATS.
>> Harris: WHATEVER IS
GETTABLE, HE WANTS IT.
SPEAKING WHENEVER I HEAR THE
CLINTON CLEANER OUT THERE
DEFENDING THE TRUMP, MY EARS, I
JUST FEEL LIKE I WANT TO WATCH
THEM OUT WITH SOMETHING BECAUSE
IT'S ALSO TAWDRY.
LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID EARLIER OVER
THE WEEKEND WHEN HE SAID I'VE
BEEN A LAWYER FOR A LONG TIME
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN A LAWYER
BEHAVE THIS WAY TALKING ABOUT
COHEN AND THE FACT THAT HE
RECORDED ALL OF THESE
CONVERSATIONS WITH CLIENTS AND
NOW HE'S SAYING THE REASON WHY
HE DID THIS IS BECAUSE HE LIKE
TO RECORD THINGS RATHER THAN
TAKING NOTES.
HE HAS SAID THAT IT IS ACTUALLY
DEVICES THAT PEOPLE MIGHT RECORD
TO HELP TAKE NOTES.
IT MAKES IT EASIER
CONTEMPORANEOUSLY.
YOU CAN GET AN ASSISTANT TO HELP
YOU TRANSCRIBE.
THEY SAID IT WASN'T UNCOMMON.
>> Guy: IS AN INTERESTING
CONVERSATION TO HAVE ABOUT THE
TAPE BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S
VOICE ON ONE OF THEM.
>> Harris: WOULDN'T YOU TELL
THE PRESIDENT THAT YOU WERE
RECORDING HIM IF HE WERE HIS
CONFIDANT?
>> Guy: YOU ASSUME TRUMP WOULD
BE UNDERSTANDABLY UPSET TO LEARN
THAT HE WAS SURREPTITIOUSLY
RECORDED BY HIS OWN ATTORNEY AND
THAT TAPE IS NOW LEAKING TO CNN.
AS A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO.
TODAY ON OUR NETWORK AND ANOTHER
ONE SAYING THAT COLLUSION IS NOT
A CRIME.
WAS IS A CHANGE OR A PIVOT FROM
THERE IS NO COLLUSION.
AND I'M SITTING HERE WATCHING
A NEW LEGAL STRATEGY?
THEY HAVE INSISTED AND SWORN TOP
TO BOTTOM THERE WAS NO
COLLUSION, AND IF THE PRESIDENT
TOP LAWYER NOW IS OUT THERE
CEDING THIS MESSAGING ON
TELEVISION THAT COLLUSION
WOULDN'T BE A CRIME, THAT SEEMS
LIKE A BIT OF A CHANGE AND ON
MEETING.
DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT AT THAT
MEETING.
THAT WAS NEVER THE ALLEGATION.
NOT THAT HE WAS THERE, THAT'S AN
ODD DENIAL OF SOMETHING THAT NO
ONE IS ALLEGING.
>> Adrienne: YOU BRING UP SUCH
A GREAT POINT BECAUSE IT IS
TRUE, WE HAVE NOT HEARD THIS
FROM GIULIANI SO FAR.
DIDN'T COLLUDE, THERE IS NO
COLLUSION, NOT YOU HAVE AN
ATTORNEY WHO IS GOING ON CABLE
NEWS CONSTANTLY SAYING BY THE
WAY, COLLUSION IS NOT A CRIME.
>> Melissa: I THINK IT HAS
MORE TO DO WITH WHY ARE THEY
INVESTIGATING IF IT'S NOT A
CRIME?
>> Kennedy: I DO THINK THAT IS
A LEGAL STRATEGY.
A SHIFT LIKE THAT, THERE'S
SOMETHING INTENTIONAL GOING ON
AND BACK TO MICHAEL COHEN, HE
ONLY HAD THREE CLIENTS AND MAYBE
YOU ARE DOING SO MANY UNTOWARD
ACTS ON BEHALF OF HIS VERY FEW
CLIENTS.
>> Harris: BUT HE WAS BUT
GETTING PAID, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE SHADY, YOU CAN JUST DO YOUR
