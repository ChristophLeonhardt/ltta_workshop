happy Friday this has been a wild week of news particularly from our nation's capital you can go snow blind trying to look at any given piece of what's been happening inside the beltway and swirling around the White House these past few days but while we are following the chaos at the White House and Congress and mushrooming indictments and the Russia investigation and the gun controversy and all the rest of it very different and every bit as urgent news has continued to develop halfway around the world North Korea and the Kim dynasty have been a national security headache for America and American presidents since the end of the Korean War but North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons means they are now on the verge of being not just a headache but a real global threat and it is not clear that any American president has had a terrific answer for this problem over the past couple of weeks we've seen this current president impose yet more sanctions which he then followed by sending his daughter somewhat incongruous ly to personally brief the South Korean president about those sanctions and then just a day later we learned that his daughter had just been stripped of her security clearance but as I say nobody's had the perfect response tonight I'm excited to say we've got the perfect person to show us what is actually going on inside the American standoff with North Korea and crucially how the North was able to get as far as they did with their nuclear ambitions some of what you're about to see is gonna surprise you NBC's chief foreign correspondent my friend Richard Engel has spent his career reporting on conflict and intrigue around the world tonight he's really got something and he is reporting from Seoul South Korea here now is on assignment with Richard Engel welcome it's Saturday morning in Seoul South Korea as Rachel just said I have spent a lot of time covering conflicts but one thing I didn't expect to be reporting on is the possibility even the remote possibility of a nuclear conflict but here I am and that's what we're doing talking about rising tensions with a nuclear-armed North Korea now North Korea is a small poor isolated country with very limited resources but in my hotel room the other day I watched Vladimir Putin the president of the world's second largest nuclear power make a presentation that included a slide showing a nuclear strike on Florida experts say he may well be bluffing to whip up his supporters but it doesn't take a concerned scientist to tell you that the threat of nuclear war is back and with a vengeance we'll have a concern scientists or two on the show and the story of a very brave young woman who escaped from North Korea when she was just 13 but first we have a story that shows how these two threats from Russia and North Korea are connected we got our hands on a partial copy of a report that is due to be released by the UN later this month it was prepared by a team of experts who monitor North Korea to see if it's complying with the sanctions you won't be surprised to hear that the short answer is now the full report is more than 200 pages long and details a whole litany of allegations that the North Koreans are helping the Syrian government's missile and chemical weapons program that they're selling missiles to the military in Myanmar and are generally involved in all kinds of dirty business the report says that the North Koreans smuggled out nearly 200 million dollars worth of goods in just nine months last year this money is helping immensely to keep the regime in power and its weapons program going the report specifically mentioned several cases where coal was smuggled out of North Korea through Russia now that got our attention because we've been investigating illicit trade from North Korea for a while in fact we just got back from a reporting trip to Vladivostok in the far eastern corner of Russia late night at Moscow's Yaroslavsky station calling all passengers for the legendary trans-siberian railway this train is not the fastest way to get to Russia's Far East but it is the most dramatic it runs over 5700 miles of track across eight time zones sixteen rivers and more than 80 cities and towns before arriving finally in Vladivostok we were welcomed by professor Artyom liquor from a local State University I asked him the question that brought us here we've heard reports that Russia is helping North Korea evade sanctions is that true I've seen such reports but all they're just allegations what sense does it make for Russia to help North Korea violate the sanctions Lucan who doesn't officially speak for the government but rarely disagrees with the Kremlin told me that Vladivostok is so close to where the North Koreans do their nuclear tests that the last one shook his apartment building this is a part of Russia the world rarely sees Vladivostok still feels very Soviet it's gritty and this time of year freezing cold this is the far eastern edge of Russia where the Asian continent ends and the now frozen sea begins and although this area may look completely blocked off right now by the ice this is actually an essential shipping route ports are the main engine of the economy here cars timber scrap metal seafood there are ships being loaded and offloaded everywhere we have been tracking a Russian ship called the Vita's in mid-october according to logs we had obtained it started heading out to sea and then disappeared probably by turning off its transponder it is very unusual for this beacon this a is as it's known to be turned off and that in itself is a powerful indicator of criminal activity or sanctions busting activity former CIA officer norman rule spent more than 30 years in intelligence gathering now he works for an organization that tracks international sanctions violations and has been comparing the movements of the Vita's with those of a North Korean ship that was in the same area at the same time and the activities each conducted has some common characteristics first they turned off the transponder second they left traditional shipping lanes third they went to an area of water near North Korea where ships don't usually go so now when you put this data together this is so unusual that these two ships certainly deserve more investigation the tracking data doesn't reveal the nature of the cargo it was carrying but reuters quoted two european security officials who said the Vita's transferred 1600 tons of oil to the north korean ship whatever the cargo was rule says these maps tell a very familiar story it is very likely that this was a ship to ship transfer similar ships similar size approximately same time going to a very unusual area a few days after it disappeared the VTS reappeared in Russia we wanted to see if it was still here we're looking for a ship called Venus she'll check wonderful the guard remembered seeing the ship coming into port but when she checked the records the ship's name wasn't on them is there someone we can reach out to talk to who owns the ship do you know who brought it here is there a a registered name of the the owner or something like that we go in and see it so we couldn't get in but at least we did confirm that the ship is in fact here now we have to find a way to get to it we did eventually find a way to get to the Vita's and capture these images neither the company that owns it nor Russian authorities responded when we asked why the ghost ship wasn't recorded on the ports books next we set off to search for two more ships both Chinese owned this satellite image from this past summer shows one of them the Sun Union at a local port nothing unusual about that except that it looks like it made a secret stop on the way there according to the manifest the ship once it left its last commercial stop was going straight to the port of the hood gun but somewhere in that in that distance it took on additional cargo because the ship was lower in the water it's draft changed so it's proof it's evidence the ship took on additional cargo almost certainly from North Korea another satellite image shows another Chinese ship great spring in the same port at the same time they're next to each other literally next to each other for one day the profile would fit the storyline of a ship undertaking commercial activity as a cover stops in North Korea picks up a cargo and then looks for a buyer finds a buyer and the buyer takes the goods on to China the second slide which that cargo according to the US Treasury Department was coal the department presented its evidence to a House committee back in September it's highly suspicious this is exactly the type of activity you would look for if you were seeking to identify sanctions busting and yet great spring was not sanctioned and we found it and filled it here in Russia ready for the next load no Russian official was willing to discuss our findings so we went yet again to see Artyom yukkin when we last met I asked you whether Russia was helping North Korea evade sanctions and you said absolutely not you said there's no evidence no proof correct yeah we went out and saw some of these ships sitting in Russian harbors the same ships allegedly going back and forth bringing goods illegally into North Korea well how could you know have you looked inside the ship I haven't personally seen any credible evidence rule who's looked at the evidence closely says it's very credible no one turns off their transponder for routine activity no one leaves an international shipping lane for routine activity the question is whether they transport prohibited banned goods and substances our understanding is they were shipping coal and oil coal and oil call coming from North Korea oil going back and under the new sanctions those would be prohibited items so Richard or even if what you're saying is really true do you think they would make a huge difference to to North Korea there is of course no way of knowing the answer to that question but North Korea is starved for cash and weapons parts which means any prescribed trade whether it's imports or exports that can raise foreign currency could help the regime's weapons program it's a good thing to remember that ships go in two directions and the North Koreans have a long history of seeking whenever possible Western technology to support their weapons program if there's evidence that we've seen evidence that there is smuggling of at least fuel mm-hmm between Russia and North Korea mm-hmm isn't it possible that other things like weapons components could also be smuggled well Richard frankly no offense to you but are you are journalists you are not a sanctions experts rule of course is a sanctions expert when you have again similar ships of a similar size in a similar period of time leaving shipping lanes going to an unusual part of the nearby waters turning off their transponders you have more than sufficient reason to say that these these entities deserve serious and significant monitoring and investigation there was one more ship we wanted to find in Vladivostok a North Korean ferry but it wasn't there Russian authorities stopped it and sent it back to North Korea on suspicion that it was carrying illegal goods including ones that could have military use we went to see the ferries Russian operator Vladimir baranov has this ship your ship the monkey bone ever moved weapons weapons components unit II you say niat nyet nyet no way no way but you also say you don't inspect the cargo so how do you know what you're carrying is this legit was Baranov admitted that he didn't but claimed that the american agents with cameras were watching the port closely if we were really doing something wrong he said our ferry would be on the sanction list everyone we spoke to in Vladivostok was convinced that the Americans were watching everything and yet none of the ships have been sanctioned I think it's impossible to deal with the North Korean problem without addressing the Russian aspects of this issue and looking at Russian firms ports facilities that aid these ships companies that own these ships and placing them under the same scrutiny that you would apply to other countries in the region Lucan insisted Russia has no interest in helping North Korea develop its weapons program but says Russia also doesn't want to help the u.s. bring North Korea to its knees well the problem is to my mind that the US would like to impose no total blockade on North Korea just to strangle the country and of course Russia would never agree to these both for humanitarian reasons and for political reasons unfortunately Russia has a rich history of often being an obstacle to sanctions against some of the darkest characters in the international spirit I'm confident that the Russians can be moved to a position where they can undertake this activity if that pressure is applied last Friday the president did raise the pressure but not on Russia North Korea we imposed today the heaviest sanctions ever imposed on a country before specifically the administration was targeting those who trade with North Korea sanctioning one individual 27 companies and 28 ships tied to eight countries including North Korea and all its neighbors except for one Russia and there's another question we want and try to answer how did the North Koreans make the leap and build a rocket that could reach the US next we meet an expert who says the answer may be well you guessed it Russia plus nuclear missiles and bad haircuts are all most people know about the Hermit Kingdom and its leader Kim jong-un for North Koreans the reality is far stranger I thought Kim jong-il was a God who could read in my mind who could read your thoughts yes that young woman's harrowing story coming up stay with us hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
