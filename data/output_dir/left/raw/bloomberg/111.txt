1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:04,260
Imagine commuting 1,000 feet above traffic.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,740
50 years ago, during the golden age of helicopter
travel, you could.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,490
Until a tragic accident in 1977 brought that
era to a close.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,200
But with new technology on the horizon, a
new age of airborne commuting could be just

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,370
around the corner.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,110
Ever since the first skyscrapers shot upward,
visions of New York City's future showcased

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,040
convenient access to the skies.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,540
Those visions were realized in 1953, when
a helicopter airline called New York Airways

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,660
established a schedule of routes carrying
passengers between Manhattan's riverside heliports

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,940
and New York City's airports in a fleet of
repurposed Boeing and Sikorsky military helicopters.

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,130
For as little as $5, you could hop on one
of their 20-seat shuttles and be at your departure

12
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,640
gate within 10 minutes.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,540
At its peak, New York Airways served over
a half million passengers a year, with dozens

14
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,680
of daily scheduled flights.

15
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,280
We always flew past the Statue of Liberty
on our way to Newark to give the passengers

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,570
a good view of that.

17
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:14,040
It was great, for a young pilot, it was exciting.

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,430
You see on television overhead pictures of
New York.

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,850
Well, there you were, right in the middle
of it.

20
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,850
It was awesome.

21
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,030
As I say this, it's giving me chills.

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,540
In the early 1960s, the construction of the
Pan Am skyscraper in the heart of Midtown

23
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,920
Manhattan offered an exciting and unprecedented
new expansion for New York Airways.

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,030
Situated directly above the iconic Grand Central
Terminal, the massive 59-story office complex

25
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,840
was a symbolic link between the era of trains
below and the Jet Age above.

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,860
At the time, Pan Am was the largest and most
famous international airline.

27
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,930
To top off their eponymous building, the tower
had a unique modern amenity: a rooftop heliport,

28
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,550
for passengers connecting on to Pan Am flights.

29
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:07,189
In 1965, New York Airways partnered with Pan
Am and added the midtown rooftop to its routes.

30
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:12,159
The rooftop helipad became a widely admired
cultural landmark, making its way into Hollywood

31
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,650
films such as the 1968 Clint Eastwood thriller,
Coogan's Bluff.

32
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,189
Business trip?

33
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:20,659
You might call it that.

34
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:24,810
Director Ridley Scott has said that landing
on the Pan Am roof was the inspiration for

35
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,260
his futuristic sets in his sci-fi epic, Blade
Runner.

36
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:36,880
The Pan Am roof was, rounding it off, it was
pretty close to 900 feet high.

37
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:45,030
It was extremely challenging, especially at
night and in the weather.

38
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,129
Probably the most challenging thing I've ever
done, except for getting shot at in Vietnam.

39
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,880
But I enjoyed it; it was fun.

40
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:55,380
Not everyone was pleased with the new route,
however.

41
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:02,520
The things that bothered us the most were the noise factor and the danger.

42
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,880
It was sort of a fun idea: yeah, it's futuristic.

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,140
Then when you think about it, do you really want a bus overhead, in populated areas,

44
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,740
in Midtown Manhattan?

45
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,200
To me, that still doesn't make sense.

46
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,960
The board ended up approving it.

47
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,080
I really did become scared that something
was going to happen.

48
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,739
A big helicopter bringing people in from New
York's Kennedy Airport killed five people

49
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,879
after landing on the roof of the 59-story
Pan Am Building in the center of town.

50
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,220
My boss had asked me to take a quick trip
to Nashville.

51
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,129
He suggested, to make it easy, use the helicopter.

52
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:55,629
I went across town, took the elevator up to
the Pan Am Building.

53
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:02,339
After a short time, we started to move up
the escalator and we got about halfway up,

54
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,680
when suddenly there was a loud noise and we were showered with little pieces of glass breaking.

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,060
Everything stopped.

56
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,480
And I went up and I saw that the helicopter
had flipped over on its side.

57
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:29,760
The thing that I most remember, I can still
see even today is the one body laying there

58
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,800
on the rooftop, and it was cut open in the
torso.

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,600
It was just overwhelming.

60
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,669
Loading passengers with the rotors turning

61
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,541
was not one of my favorite things, but

62
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:50,440
apparently the thinking was the cost of putting
on the rotor brake to stop the rotors but

63
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,040
still keep the engines running ended up being a maintenance cost

64
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,760
that they did not want to deal with.

65
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,200
This is the point that the landing gear broke,
on the top part of the strut.

66
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,410
It basically just rolled over this way.

67
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:10,710
Four passengers waiting to board were killed
instantly by the projectile rotor blades.

68
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,600
One piece of a rotor blade flew off the roof
and smashed into an office window on the side

69
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,880
of the Pan Am Building.

70
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,800
Another piece fell 60 stories down to the
street, killing a 29-year old woman as she

71
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,280
made her way home during the rush hour commute.

72
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,880
In the wake of the disaster, the city immediately

73
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,400
suspended all service to the Pan Am Building rooftop

74
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,140
The NTSB launched an investigation and concluded
that the accident was due

75
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,300
to high cycle fatigue propagation.

76
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,580
In other words, wear and tear.

77
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,400
As for the public image of helicopter travel:

78
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,310
It didn't do the image any good.

79
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:59,680
Consequently, there is no rooftop helicopter
operations in New York City or any places

80
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,450
around the country that I know of, maybe a
couple of hospitals or something.

81
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:10,060
Owing to litigation costs, rising fuel prices,
and declining traffic due to its damaged reputation,

82
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,900
New York Airways went out of business two
years later.

83
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,150
In Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago,
similar helicopter services operated throughout

84
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,610
the 1960s and 70s.

85
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,380
Financial issues and a series of fatal crashes

86
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,740
forced most of these companies out of business as well.

87
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,980
Since the demise of New York Airways, other
ventures have attempted to replicate scheduled

88
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:44,050
helicopter service, including a brief attempt
in the late 1980s by Donald Trump.

89
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,090
All failed.

90
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,590
Despite the decline of scheduled service,
overall traffic surged in the 1980s due to

91
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:57,060
increased private charters for corporate travel
and for tourist sightseeing around Manhattan.

92
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,520
Concerns about noise, however, caused a major
backlash, forcing the city to dramatically

93
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,100
reduce flights and heliport access in recent
years.

94
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,200
As New York City's population, traffic and
wealth have increased, the demand for reliable,

95
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,640
time-saving means of transportation is arguably
higher than ever.

96
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,200
A newcomer to the short-distance aviation
market called BLADE, launched in 2013, is

97
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,550
harkening back to the golden age of commercial
travel powered by modern ridesharing technology.

98
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:32,560
Before BLADE, it would cost $6000 to fly to
the Hamptons, probably about $3000 to go to

99
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,770
the airport.

100
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:41,139
We now fly people to the airport for $195,
we fly people to the Hamptons for $595.

101
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,770
It's still expensive, but we're now getting
to the point where we're really almost at

102
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,490
ride-sharing, black car pricing.

103
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,120
BLADE, like Uber, doesn't actually own any
of its vehicles.

104
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,490
Instead, it contracts with helicopter charter
companies and focuses on providing a consistent,

105
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,190
customer-facing experience through a mobile
app.

106
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,770
Ultimately, BLADE faces many of the same obstacles
that the industry has faced for years:

107
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,740
the high hourly cost of helicopter operations,
and

108
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,640
the noise.

109
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,430
But there's a new technology on the horizon
that could mitigate those issues.

110
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:21,100
Five, six years from now is really going to
be the dawn of what we call e-VTOL:

111
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,220
electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing rotorcraft.

112
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,560
The beauty of these rotorcraft is that they
are quiet, and they are less expensive.

113
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,659
BLADE, along with Uber, Larry Page and others,
are betting on e-VTOL technology to introduce

114
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,759
a new golden age of airborne commuting.

115
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,499
The technology is still very primitive, but
if battery capacity, safety and air traffic

116
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:49,260
obstacles can be overcome, rooftop point to
point transport could become a reality again.

117
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,819
Meanwhile, 800 feet above the bustling streets
of Manhattan, the heliport atop the former

118
00:08:54,819 --> 00:09:00,379
Pan Am Building remains closed, a 40-year-old
reminder of how an unexpected tragedy can

119
00:09:00,379 --> 00:00:00,000
change the course of an industry - and a city
- forever.
