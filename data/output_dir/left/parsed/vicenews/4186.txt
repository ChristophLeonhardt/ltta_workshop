— We are in a parking lot that Houston
let us use as a staging area.
Everyone is conducting their pre-trips,
where we check all our vehicles and make sure
that everything’s going to work safely for the day.
And we receive our instructions of
where we’re going to go and pick up,
and then we head out and start our day.
We are here in the Kingwood area.
It’s kind-of an eerie feeling because
you see these beautiful homes,
and they’ve all got open windows, you know,
and some of the doors have been removed.
Just like a ghost town.
Basically, everything on the inside of the home
is on the front yard of the house now.
This truck is a grabber that picks up debris.
We throw it in the back of these trailers,
and then drivers will take it to the landfill…
— I’ll take this load and come back to get another one.
— Yeah.
Sounds good, man.
— …and they dump that and come back and
repeat the whole process five or six times a day.
I’ve never experienced anything of this magnitude.
As I’m picking up these items,
you’re picking up people’s memories.
You’re picking up family heirlooms,
and they’ll never get it back.
— I was able to save some pictures,
but as I opened up a cedar chest
I found some postcards that my husband
wrote to me when he was en route to Vietnam.
I mean, these things are dated 1968.
I was in the Army Nurse Corps,
so this came from Okinawa.
So I’m trying to salvage that.
I can buy another couch,
but where am I going to get another one of those?
Just a memory.
So seeing that, it’s just…
it’s heartbreaking.
It really is, I…
— We started about 10 hours ago,
we started about 30 yards that way,
and we ended up here.
And that was four or five trucks full,
50 tons worth of rubbish.
Six houses, worth 50 tons.
So you do the math.
It’s a lot.
But we’ll be back at it tomorrow bright and early.
