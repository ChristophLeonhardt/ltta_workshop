we're also following breaking news in the case against former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort he just entered a plea in court in Virginia NBC News justice correspondent Pete Williams is in our Washington newsroom Pete what can you tell us well as expected he pleaded not guilty so there will be a trial we expected that but here's the surprise Katie the judge has set a trial date having this trial in Virginia start before the case was scheduled to start in Washington DC the hearing is just wrapping up now this is video of Paul Manafort arriving at the Virginia courthouse where he was indicted are indicted and now arraigned on the new charges which include bank fraud charges the government says he tried to get 25 million dollars in loans improperly also faces tax fraud and charges of failing to report foreign bank transaction charges but the judge has set a trial date of July 10th now you recall that just a few weeks ago the judge in Washington in a case that began last October four months ago has set a trial date of September 17th and so we were curious to see what would happen with this case in Virginia to see whether the judge would engage in frankly a little bit of judicial one-upsmanship now that Alexandria courthouse prides itself on what they call the rocket docket moving quickly and in fairness to the judge's decision here the government said before this hearing that because they are so far along on the case in Washington the process of what's known as discovery where the government gives the defense relevant documents the government says that's pretty well along now and of course these are similar charges there'll be some new discovery on these additional charges in Virginia this whole thing could have been done in Washington the new charges could have been stapled on to the case in Washington but there's a rule that says you have to be charged in the Judicial District where the offense was committed so you have these new Virginia bank charges the government's asked Manta Ford's lawyers if they would waive that rule and just allow the whole thing to be in Washington and they said no so now he faces trials in two different places there's an additional question of whether this judge will have some new restriction or less restriction on letting him out of home detention he's still on home detention he's out on bond he's not in jail but there still is home detention question the judge hasn't yet been satisfied that he's put up the proper properties for his bail for his bond so that it remains a sticky problem too so it's it's always tricky when you've been charged in two different places and two different judges are in charge of what happens so we'll just have to see what happens
