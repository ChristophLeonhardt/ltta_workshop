20
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,860
be a cape the fact that I'm doing on a

21
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,270
weekend for some reason makes me feel

22
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,579
more conscious about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a bit more</font>

23

<font color="#E5E5E5">freaked out about it but yeah a couple</font>

from the beginning to the end of every

time I was a duck it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> file the court</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">wolfforth every time for decades</font>

54
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,920
everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went today those lots of</font>

55
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
old and new kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of clashing in the</font>

56
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,549
strange funny ways like the shake away

57
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,159
guy that you'll see right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and he was</font>

58
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,600
walking in front of this Cathedral those

59
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,640
hundreds and hundreds of years old and

60
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,920
it felt extremely peculiar and it

61
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,450
occurred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me that every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time I saw</font>

62
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bits of the old stone wall around</font>

63
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,590
exeter things like this even<font color="#CCCCCC"> i felt like</font>

64
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,780
the skeleton was kind of appearing

65
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,939
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ground making itself visible</font>

66
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,399
against this weird new background of

67
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,430
everyone dancing around it almost just

68
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,409
nor the streets a cobbled and it just

69
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:17,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">feels nice and old when I wasn't us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

70
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,370
did miss that a bit that kind of oldest

71
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,680
the age I was really taken in by the

72
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,299
fact that it wasn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one city</font>

73
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:24,890
skeleton that kept appearing around

74
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,599
everywhere I went it was all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

75
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,890
different cities all these different

76
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,019
times kind of combining crossing over

77
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,910
all of them skeletons but all belonging

78
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,769
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> different times like these two parts</font>

79
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:36,430
the great wall that surrounded extra I

80
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,840
found myself very consciously trying to

81
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,150
crop out the new modern buildings and I

82
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,829
don't know whether that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

83
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,750
troubling what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just have</font>

84
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,870
that original site over the ruins but

85
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,970
that's kind of impossible and there was

86
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,560
these weird things like jack wills<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

87
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,060
in these old buildings and I wonder what

88
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,040
tinleigh's was and just lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

89
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,470
suggestions of a previous skeletons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

90
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,530
previous city that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was there before</font>

91
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">garand history is a little shopping</font>

92
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,140
early way of external it's a really

93
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,970
great example again of that all the new

94
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,709
flashing thing I also really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

95
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">lion and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice little colorful flags</font>

96
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,730
but weirdly the greatest example this

97
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,019
older need the thing that really bored

98
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:14,359
at home was the changing rooms of urban

99
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,639
outfitters where they've used these old

100
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,760
and very original brick work and leave

101
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,200
what's got<font color="#CCCCCC"> their huge mirror and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> force</font>

102
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the trading room though they've got a</font>

103
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,889
side of concrete as well so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I've</font>

104
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">got a bit obsessed with material today</font>

105
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:29,239
but I just get a postcard or<font color="#CCCCCC"> vector and</font>

106
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,730
I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write a little letter and add</font>

107
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,380
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my letters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send project</font>

108
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,540
so good things came out this day one

109
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,739
quick see at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end that I've got to</font>

110
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:39,109
mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went to check the stroke</font>
