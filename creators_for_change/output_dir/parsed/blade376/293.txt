math fellow Americans no but seriously
though really seriously yo what's up
happy july the full for everyone out
there it's a independence day today and
for me being British I feel no being
British I feel as though I can still
appreciate such a great day like anyone
else in the world because without a day
like this we would still be overrun by
aliens today so I'd like this tribute to
go out to will smith and that other guy
who drove his plans the alien spaceship
so happy fourth of July people adios
