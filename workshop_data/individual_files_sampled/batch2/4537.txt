so we have Eddie Glaude with us now Princeton University professor and Eddie I want to play for you again the statement by Rhonda sent us on Fox News this is a United States congressman and listen to the words he use and then I'll give you the stage to speak here it is yo he is an articulate spokesman for those far left views and he's a charismatic candidate and you know I watched those Democrat debates and none of that it was my cup of tea but I mean he performed better than the other people there so so we've got to work hard to make sure that we continue Florida going in a good direction let's build off the success we've had on Governor Scott the last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state Eddie what's your take well make a look we are at this extraordinary crossroads in this country you know I've been called articulate I've never been used I've never been described as monkeying up anything but that's obviously a racial dog whistle but we're at a crossroads and it's not just simply about the loud racist I've said this on the show before we have to make a choice we have to make a choice as a country whether we're going to be otherwise we've had we've been a crossroads before the Civil War reconstruction the New Deal the civil rights movement and each moment in which we're at a crossroads something changed but we've always doubled back down double down on our prejudices so here we are once again we are right back where we've always been well we have to make a decision whether or not we're going to be a racist nation this is the key we have to make a choice whether you're a Republican Democrat independent or whatever we're gonna have to make a choice in the upcoming days of whether or not this is going to be a racist America will we still be racist and it can't be just simply you just can't simply choose the sidelines in this moment so we will see buckle up it's about to get really really ugly here I want to get a sense of how the Democrats should respond at this point especially given Mike Barnacles point this has been a long road and this is not a surprise in many ways we'll get to that ahead still ahead on Morning Joe the president says White House Counsel Don McGann is out and McGann apparently learned about it the same time the rest of us did over twitter will talk to law professor Jonathan Turley about the implications of this latest departure you're watching Morning Joe we'll be right back thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
