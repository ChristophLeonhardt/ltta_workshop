My first thought when
watching the coverage was
that those 13 people
are going to die.
I think one of
the biggest jobs
those rescue divers had 
was keeping the children calm.
Whoever is in that
litter has likely spent
a very, very long time
in freezing cold water.
Those emergency blankets,
or space blankets,
do a decent job at
retaining body heat.
They basically bundled
these children
using a flexible
plastic stretcher.
In the way that these divers
navigate appears to be
using a static line
that was most likely
bolted into the rock face
and anchored permanently,
or semi-permanently,
in that way
so that the divers were able
to simply follow that line.
The person 
on the left has
basic open-circuit 
scuba equipment.
You can see that 
silver air cylinder.
And the person 
on the right
actually has what’s 
called a “rebreather.”
It actually allows you
to dive for much longer
than a standard 
scuba system.
So the reason 
to have two tanks:
One is redundancy.
If say there’s an equipment
failure with the first tank
you could switch your
regulator over and
breathe off 
the second tank.
The other reason
would be to extend
the duration of the dive so
that you could switch over
to a second tank if
you’re running low on air
on the first tank.
It seemed like a really
impossible situation.
So I was absolutely amazed
that they got everybody out
and that the only —
that they only suffered
one fatality and that that
was one of the rescue divers.
