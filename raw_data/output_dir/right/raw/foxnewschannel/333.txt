KAVANAUGH WAS CONFIRMED TO

5
00:00:12,157 --> 00:00:12,790
THE SUPREME COURT TWEETED

00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,792
SUPPORT FOR ABOLISHING THE

00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:15,793
ELECTORAL COLLEGE TO PREVENT

THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE A

13
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:25,135
SHADOW OF SLAVERY'S POWER ON

14
00:00:25,136 --> 00:00:26,236
AMERICA TODAY THAT

15
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:28,305
UNDERMINES OUR NATION AS A

16
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:29,340
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.

17
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:31,975
SO, WHY DOES THE ELECTORAL

18
00:00:31,976 --> 00:00:32,710
COLLEGE MATTER?

19
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:34,445
JOINING US NOW DINESH DA

20
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:35,245
SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE

FILMMAKER AND AUTHOR OF DID

AVAILABLE.

25
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:45,556
WHEN YOU READ HER TWEET,

26
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:46,690
WHAT DID SHE THINK SHE WAS

27
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:47,157
TALKING ABOUT.

28
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:48,926
>> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK SHE

29
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:52,162
IS CONFUSING THE ELECTORAL

30
00:00:52,163 --> 00:00:55,799
COLLEGE WITH THE THREE FIFTH

31
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,133
CLAUSE.

32
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:57,267
THE THREE FIFTH CLAUSE WAS

33
00:00:57,268 --> 00:00:59,036
ABOUT SLAVERY ARGUMENT NORTH

34
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:00,637
AND SOUTH OVER

35
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:01,105
REPRESENTATION.

36
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:02,172
IRONICALLY THE NORTH, WHICH

37
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:04,341
WAS THE ANTI-SLAVERY SIDE

38
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:06,243
WANTED BLACKS TO COUNT FOR

39
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:07,544
ZERO BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO

40
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:08,612
REDUCE THE REPRESENTATIVE

41
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:09,747
POWER OF THE SLAVE STATES.

42
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:12,483
THE SOUTH WANTED BLACKS TO

43
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:15,819
COUNT FOR A FULL PERSON.

44
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,256
THREE FIFTH CLAUSE TO

45
00:01:19,257 --> 00:01:21,158
PRESENTED TO SHOW THE BLACKS

46
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,494
NOT TO BE FULLY HUMAN ISN'T

47
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:25,829
AT ALL.

48
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,064
ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS A

49
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:27,564
DIFFERENT MATTER.

50
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:28,932
LARGE STATES AND SMALL

51
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:30,033
STATES.

52
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:30,367
NOT.

53
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,101
ANNA: AT THIS QUAKED ISSUE,

54
00:01:31,102 --> 00:01:32,069
WE HAVE STLA NOW.

55
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,237
WE HAVE LARGE STATES, WE

56
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:35,038
HAVE SMALL STATES, IF WE HAD

57
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:37,107
A SYSTEM THAT GAVE POWER

58
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:38,409
ONLY TO THE LARGE STATES.

59
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,577
THE SMALL STATES WOULD BE

60
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:41,011
UNREPRESENTED.

61
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:42,546
THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING

62
00:01:42,547 --> 00:01:44,047
THE CORE OF OUR FOUNDING IS

63
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:45,315
THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.

64
00:01:45,316 --> 00:01:46,483
TO CREATE A UNION, THE

65
00:01:46,484 --> 00:01:47,785
FOUNDERS NEEDED THE CONSENT

66
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:48,819
OF THE LARGE STATES AND

67
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,820
SMALL STATES.

68
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:51,655
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS

69
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:54,758
PART OF THAT ARITHMETIC.

70
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,159
STEVE: SURE.

71
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,194
YOU KNOW, DINESH, THE

72
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:58,395
ELECTORAL COLLEGE HAS BECOME

73
00:01:58,396 --> 00:01:59,863
A TALKING POINT FOR THE LEFT

74
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:00,497
BECAUSE, LOOK AT DONALD

75
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:00,798
TRUMP.

76
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,965
HE WON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

77
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:03,400
BUT LOST THE POPULAR VOTE.

78
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:04,668
SAME THING WITH GEORGE BUSH.

79
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:06,069
SO WE HAVE HEARD THIS FOR A

80
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,370
WHILE.

81
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:07,538
>> WE HAVE HEARD IT FOR A

82
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:07,838
WHILE.

83
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:09,239
I THINK, YOU KNOW, IN THIS

84
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,340
CASE, I'M NOT SAYING WE

85
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:11,375
SHOULDN'T HAVE A DEBATE

86
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:11,775
ABOUT THIS.

87
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:15,279
THE PROBLEM IS THAT SOMEONE

88
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,680
ONCE SAID TONIGHT TAKE A

89
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:17,648
FENCE DOWN IF YOU DON'T KNOW

90
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:19,082
WHY IT WAS PUT UP IN THE

91
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:19,516
FIRST PLACE.

92
00:02:19,517 --> 00:02:21,452
THE FOUNDERS HAD A

93
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:22,586
PHILOSOPHICAL STATESMANSHIP

94
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:24,121
THAT TRIED TO HAVE POWERFUL

95
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:25,189
IDEAS BUT IMPLEMENTED IN THE

96
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,023
REAL WORLD.

97
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:27,458
THE PROBLEM IS TODAY WE

98
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,726
DON'T UNDERSTANDING OUR

99
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:32,129
SCHOOLS DON'T DO A GOOD JOB

100
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,263
IMPEECHING THE PRINCIPLES OF

101
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:35,466
THE FOUNDING.

102
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:39,236
YOU HAVE THIS FANATICISM.

103
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:39,837
STEVE: YOU BLAME HER

104
00:02:39,838 --> 00:00:00,000
EDUCATION.
