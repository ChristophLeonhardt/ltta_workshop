hey guys really encouraging news today about Republican voters finally saying all right I think there's something wrong with the Republican Party yes so guess what issue it's on the one I've been talking about all this time corruption say with me of course and of course Washington is shocked by the results of this poll for those that have seen it and let me give you the details of it to give you a sense of exactly what they found and how devastating it is so they polled 48 Republican districts okay not Democratic districts the ones that have already a Republican congressman in Congress then they pulled Republicans within those districts and when they asked them who's the more corrupt party by a margin of 54 to 46 the Republican voters said the Republican Party is more corrupt than the democratic party but they didn't just say the Republican Party is corrupt or both parties are corrupt they say the Republican Party is more corrupt and those are Republican voters in Republican districts now that the Democrats pull better than that better on that issue than they do on almost any other issue now it's not and now of course this is where the Washington conventional wisdom I think is wrong so is it a little bit of Scott Pruett and and Tom Price and all those guys who had those outrageous you know spending while they Pruitt was the head of the EPA and all the flights that he took in price so good when he was at HHS etc and apartments that they got for that poor got for cheap etcetera yes that is a part of it but no the bigger part of it is I think that the chickens are finally coming home to roost that the Republican voters are looking around going man it ain't ever trickle down to us and and these guys look like they're representing the rich now for those of you who aren't Republicans you're thinking of course of course the Republicans represent the rich who do you think they represent they represent their donors and Chilean corporations but for guys who are on Team Republican it took them a long time to get there but it looks like a lot of them have gotten there that is a hell of a thing for Republican voters to say that their party is more corrupt than the Democratic Party and remember a lot of them despise the Democratic Party so that is a big big place to get to so of course the Democratic Party never wanting to blow a good opportunity of course mainly doesn't get the point here now let me give them a little bit of credit I mean they could at least read polls they see the polls and they go okay good good good so we know what they did and this is hilarious and this is why people don't like politicians they added an anti-corruption plank to their slogan of a better deal I mean first of all is there a more benign slogan I mean if the slogan was a benign deal it still wouldn't be more benign like it's so vanilla I don't want to take any chances about policy kind of a better deal whatever right and they forgot to add corruption and so they went back in there like yeah it's not the polling we meant corruption and then they Nancy Pelosi says that the Republicans are cravenly beholden to big money interests now at the same time when you ask Danny Pelosi why do you think you should be the leader of the Democrats in the house she says well I raise the most amount of money pretty sure you don't get it no that's the problem that's not the solution you just said that there the Republicans are cravenly beholden to big money interest that is absolutely right unfortunately so are you and you brag about it oh I raise big money from big donors the problem is he blows he isn't that she's too liberal that's preposterous the problem is that voters feel that she's part of it elite and Democrats can get upset about that ago no it's not fair it's this and that other thing but same thing with Hillary Clinton you can complain about it you could say it's not fair but they thought she was the elite and they voted against her so Democratic Party you've got an excellent winning issue here and not because you're so great but because the Republicans are so much worse it's true they are worse so can you please figure out politics a little bit look at who's winning the uncorrupted candidates the ones that are not taking corporate PAC money so yes Alexandria Castillo Cortez yes Kara Eastman yes all of these Justus Democrats all across the country that are doing great and have shocked the world in a lot of ways Brent welder his next con yelling and the list goes on and on but but even look at your own leaders in in the Senate now Gillibrand Booker Harris have gotten the message that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and the Justice Democrats sent which is no corporate PAC money the way to run is uncorrupted if the Democratic Party actually embraces that they will be in fantastic shape but you know it's the Democratic Party so they no one knows how to rescue defeat from the jaws of victory better than Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats but having said that this is really good news because at least Republican voters in these really important districts have realized yeah our guys are not the good guys they're definitely corrupt and that is true and by the way one more piece of good news they're not alone independents which are even more important have say 60% of them say that the Republican Party is corrupt that's a great number in an accurate number so for God's sake Democrats get uncorrupted as quickly as you can so that this is the moment that you could actually win without big-money because people are so sick of that big-money controlling their politicians and sick of that corruption so go now
