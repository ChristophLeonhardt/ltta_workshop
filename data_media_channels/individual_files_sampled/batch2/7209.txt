Rudy Giuliani Donald Trump's lawyer was on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd and he was explaining why Donald Trump so far has refused to answer questions by special counsel robert muller and during this exchange Giuliani said something that later turned into a meme take a look look I'm not gonna be rushed into having him testify so that he gets trapped into perjury and when you tell me that you know he should testify because he's gonna tell the truth that he shouldn't worry well that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth not the truth he didn't have a a conversation this crowd I don't mean to go like I know it isn't truth truth isn't truth the present United States says I didn't truth isn't truth mr. mayor do you realize what I know don't do this to me don't try so ok the truth isn't the truth that's the statement that everyone's talking about but I want to read you what Giuliani said because I don't know maybe I'm reading it incorrectly but it okay let me just read it uh when you tell me that he should testify because he's going to tell the truth and he shouldn't worry well that's so silly because that's somebody's version of the truth so are you saying that Trump is gonna lie when he testifies and that's why you're concerned that he's gonna be caught in a perjury trap yeah so let's break it down you're absolutely right in your reading of it and presumably Giuliani meant to say that someone else could lie about him and they could accept his word instead of Trump's word and then call what Trump is saying a lie and hence the perjury trap but he didn't say that he said he was referring to a Trump was saying that he might not give an accurate account so it might be his 28th misstatement in a row but his literal words are indicating that Trump wouldn't tell the truth I mean you are a lawyer in the most high-profile case in the country there's no room for oh I misspoke or that was just a small error I actually meant to say this or how many times is he gonna do this no and the fish rots from the head down and so if I was being investigated by the FBI would I hire Rudy Giuliani no way the guy's a total buffoon yes I wouldn't hire him because I'd hire a competent attorney a regular attorney and one who has a specialty in this case and is careful like most attorneys but Trump hires someone as reckless and stupid as he is and Trump looks our Giuliani and thinks nailed it hey even if what he meant meant is that Trump isn't gonna lie and someone else is gonna lie don't say the phrase the truth isn't the truth how unsaved are you that you don't realize that that people will immediately take that as oh these guys have no connection to the truth they don't care about the truth what a terrible thing to say as an attorney right and as someone representing the president even if you meant it the right way which it's not clear that you did mean it the right way so I want to give you guys a little more context into this conversation so you can he clear he clarifies what he means a little bit in this next clip so let's take a look at that Donald Trump says I didn't talk about Flynn with Comey Comey says you did talk about it so tell me what the truth is Donegan life you're such a genius John began John McCain doesn't know if that's the kitchen if they have two pieces of evidence Trump says I didn't tell him and the other guy says that he did say it which is the truth we have a credibility gap between the two of them you've got to select one of the other now who do you think Moiz gonna select one of his best friends call me or the president who he has been carrying on a completely wild crazy is it possible Doc's investigation wild crazy unorthodox investigation okay so look the truth isn't the truth did turn into a meme and so Rudy Giuliani felt the need to clarify what he meant on social media I want to read you those tweets very quickly he says my statement was not meant as a pontification on moral theology but one referring to the situation where two people make precisely contradictory statements the classic he said she said puzzle sometimes further inquiry can reveal the truth other times it doesn't so just to answer it question you know you have Comey saying one thing and Trump saying the other who do you believe I would believe Comey because he doesn't have a history of constant deception as Trump does so no no so I understand what Giuliani saying I think most people understand it even though he misstated it and and stated as if Trump would be lying and he said this phrase that is of course going to get him in trouble and he's incredibly stupid for saying but but overall we all get it he's saying that hey Trump's gonna tell the truth but other guys are gonna lie about him and then and then that prosecutor will just believe Comey and other guys and then call what Trump is saying perjury even though it isn't that's the that's the claim that Giuliani is trying to make but that's not how it works and you wouldn't actually just decide hey is one guy telling the truth or the other who do I like more who would I believe so you would look for other evidence that's why Chuck Todd pointed out well McGann would know if McGann was in the room and he's the White House Counsel and we found out over the weekend he very honestly talked to Robert Muller because the idiot Donald Trump let him had and waived attorney-client privilege an executive privilege then if McGann's in the room and he backs up commis version of events as an example in that case he might not have been in the room but McGann was in the room for a lot of these things so if Trump says X and it turns out the other guys say Y the other people in the room will also say Y well then you have your answer so you the rest of the evidence will determine who's telling the truth that's why Trump should not testify if I was his lawyer I would say are you kidding me we're gonna go nowhere near Muller we're never gonna be in the same state as Muller because Trump isn't telling the truth hey and he will get caught he will definitely a carcass most of those cases there were other people in the room and they don't want to go to jail so they will tell the truth of what happened including potentially the White House Counsel the second reason why Trump might get caught is because he constantly contradicts himself so you don't even need other witnesses Trump will say I fired Comey because of the Russia investigation unnatural vision then you'll turn around and say no I didn't fire him because that I fired him because he was mean to Hillary Clinton that's literally what they that's they're going thesis now do they fired Comey because they didn't like the way he treated Hillary Clinton that was the original memo that Rosa Stein wrote and now they've come back to that but you contradicted yourself so you're by definition lying in one of those cases not only that I mean think about the way he tries to slander robert muller or James Comey I mean Robert Muller has been a lifetime or lifelong Republican but he keeps painting him as this Democrat who's on a witch hunt I mean he's lying about who Robert Muller is look Robert Muller is not it's funny because in this weird topsy-turvy world you know you find yourself as a progressive defending robber Muller when in any other situation any other scenario Robert Muller is not someone that we would typically defend but he keeps going after him as if he's like this this hardcore progressive who's trying to get Trump impeached but that is not the case so the fact that he's lying about that shows you what his character is he lies time and time again look I don't think Robert Muller even needs to talk to Trump right Trump incriminates himself on a regular basis on social media he can't help himself so collect that evidence do your job talk to the people that matter and let's let's get to a conclusion yes and finally I think that what we're gonna be left with in remembrance of this administration once Trump is taken out of office for the non-stop pathological lies I mean perjury would be the bare minimum of his problems we will remember things as truth isn't truth i Kelly and Conway saying we believe in alternative facts and Donald Trump saying what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening that is another direct quote and and by the way let's all remember that he told Leslie Stahl I I keep attacking the press cuz when you guys write negative things about me I don't want people to believe you so Anna's right he has incriminating himself a thousand times publicly it'd be great if we went to go talk to him all on the record because he would it's plainly obvious who Donald Trump is we all see it by the way even the manga guys know it you think they don't know that he's lying non-stop they know they just don't care right you know that he went to if he goes to talk to Muller he will lie about approximately 200 times you know in a half an hour so but even if he doesn't he's still toasts for all the lies he said in public let alone the obstruction of justice let alone the underlying crime
