hey everybody thanks for being here thanks for watching and listening you'll have to excuse me for showing my Ravens pride today because it is the draft the draft is ongoing and it's so stupid that people actually sit there and watch a draft so you're just watching a guy over and over again walk up to a podium and say a name and then that for just hours but I'm one of those stupid people that watches it it's I can't defend it but I do and it also shows why no matter what anyone says but oh the NFL's falling off and so some football or a basketball or baseball or hockey is gonna take over no the NFL still football still the number one sport in America and if you want evidence of that just look at the fact that millions of people millions of people like myself will sit there and watch a draft anyway so I thought I'd like to do kind of a mailbag thing today answering answering something from one of the many emails that I get throughout the week and I had that in mind this week and I was looking through my email to see if there's anything if anyone raised kind of an issue they'll be interesting for a video and I and I and I found one email that that I'd like to try to address although I am a little bit hesitant because it's a very serious issue and I you know I want to make sure that I'm approaching this the right way and saying the right things so if somebody emailed me with a distressing problem couple days ago hee hee although this is not that you know I've heard I've heard this from plenty of other people this kind of thing which is what made me think well this would be a good one to address he said that he's been getting more absorbed as in his faith recently getting more invested into his faith he's reading scripture more he's going to church he's praying he's doing all these things he'd never really done before although he'd always always been Christian but he never really been actively Christian until recently which is great you know yet he said he's also been experiencing doubt to a degree that he never very instead before sometimes just questioning I mean how can this be real how how could that have happened how could Jesus be real I mean what is what does that even this mean how how is this possible is that you know those kinds of doubts he doesn't want to question them he doesn't invite the questions in but they're just there in his head and and so he's troubled by it and he wanted to know if I had any advice well before I say anything else I just want to add my usual disclaimer that I'm not an expert on this issue or on any issue so if anyone is really going through a spiritual crisis you should certainly speak to your pastor or priest or spiritual director somebody like that I can only only share just a few thoughts I don't know if they'll be useful or not hopefully they are so let me do that okay so first of all we should establish that doubts are normal okay we all we all have them it's a normal thing it may be kind of a taboo subject in Christian circles to talk about because we're all supposed to pretend that we never have them but what everyone does it doesn't mean and I want to talk I'm gonna explain this more as we go on a little bit more towards the end but just because a doubt enters your head doesn't mean that you don't have faith so you can have faith yet be experiencing that as well we're human after all we so this is gonna happen even the people who knew Jesus and who saw him performing miracles which which you know we we have not we read about the miracles but in in Scripture but we haven't actually seen them for ourselves even those people had doubts John the Baptist who according to Jesus was the greatest man ever the greatest mortal man ever born according to Jesus was John the Baptist and even he appeared to have doubts and not only doubts but he had the after witnessing God speak from the heavens after Jesus was baptized announcing this is my son so John the Baptist heard a voice from the heavens declaring Jesus is my son and yet a little while after that he's in prison because he stood up to the sexual immorality of Herod Herod threw him in prison he's languishing in prison and he sends his followers out to find Jesus and ask Jesus are you the one are you the Messiah or should we look for another and Jesus's response to that is I think really interesting Jesus says okay go tell go tell John that go tell them what you've seen the blind can see the lame can walk the dead have been raised and he says blessed are those who are not scandalized in me and what Jesus means by that he says not scandalized in me meaning blessed are the people who who yeah I may not be acting the way you thought the Messiah was going to act this may not be playing out the way you thought it would but blessed are the people who just humble themselves before that truth and accept what's actually happening rather than being you know kind of offended or outraged or taken aback by the fact that I don't fit into this box that you had you know that you've this kind of fictional box of what you think I'm Messiah is supposed to be so he said so he sends his he sends them back to tell John the Baptist that so that's John the Baptist appearing to have doubts now I've heard some Christians and some theologians have have argued that you could interpret that passage a little bit differently and John sent his followers to Jesus to ask that question he sent them for for their own sake so that they would know John already knew he didn't question it but he sent them for their sake that's a very generous interpretation for John the Baptist's sake but I don't see that in the scripture there's no real evidence of that all we see is John asking this question so it would really appear that he himself had doubts so that's the first thing it's natural for our egos our egos are going to rebel against this thing this truth that is so beyond our capacity for comprehension that's natural second it's not actually surprising although it seems surprising it seems counterintuitive it's not actually surprising that somebody would have doubts that actually intensify for a season as they delve deeper into their faith and but for two for two reasons number one because Satan is going to see that you're drawing nearer to God he's gonna see that you're getting all Christian on him and he's not gonna like that so he's gonna pull out all the stops to sabotage you sabotage you but but for another I think the Bible is is much easier and more palatable and much easier to ingest when we see it only in these little soundbites these little slogans these little chunks these little just inspirational tweets or whatever when that's all that we've seen of the Bible just the things that are kind of out there in the culture in the book and our in our vocabulary in our language and that's all we see of the Bible it's much easier for us to wrap our heads around but when we really study it and we read it seriously and we take it seriously and we read it in context then we read it from you know the entire context of it paged cover to cover type of thing then we can think we begin to appreciate not only the scriptures richness and beauty but also its complexity and its challenges and its mysteries and even its apparent contradictions just as one example if you've never really read if you've never really read the Gospels all you've done is you've just skimmed we've seen the chunks then you probably think you've got it pretty nailed on you've got the the story of the resurrection in your head you think you've got it nailed down you basically understand that the women go to the tomb and then there's an angel and then they go back and you think you've got all the you think you've basically yeah you understand that but then you go and you read all the gospel accounts and you start to see you now wait a second what's going on here because there appear to be several different stories that all contradict and now you're more can view more you're more confused now than you were before you even read it when it takes an even closer look to see how okay all these things really do line up when we consider the different perspectives and the different ways that the Gospel writers are trying to tell this story and the different things that they're focusing on and then it all kind of starts to line up so the point is when we start to read the Bible we see that it's not as simple as we thought based on our skimming of it and this realization is fascinating and it's invigorating and and all of that but there's also a certain anxiety that comes with it and that's normal and we shouldn't panic over that I think two thoughts occur to anyone who actually reads the Gospels carefully number one there is so much here that is mysterious and and impossible to understand number two nobody wouldn't make up a story like this even the hardest parts that the parts that seem to make the least amount of sense they actually only further approve the authenticity of the gospel because nobody would make that up nobody if somebody was inventing the story they wouldn't put that in there they wouldn't write it like that that's not the way it would be so you know in the past I have felt myself challenged by the what I would call kind of the the the spareness of Scripture its its lack of drama its lack of the kind of details that you would expect it to have its its you know the way that especially in the Gospels things aren't really fleshed out the way you might think they will be so you've got this whole gap in Christ's life between infancy and his public ministry with just this one random brief scene in the middle where he gets separated from his parents his parents come back and find him in the temple but there's just that and then and then but but between but besides that it's just he's a baby and then his public ministry and you think well why you know what's going on why didn't you tell why didn't you give us a few more what happened in between that time why aren't you telling us that and then Christ enters into his public ministry and all of these incredible things are happening but the gospel for the most part just relays these things in a really matter-of-fact way it never dwells on anything for very long so he multiplies loaves he walks on water he heals the blind he raises the dead he casts out demons he's doing all of this but there's so little drama in the way these incidents are told to us these incidents themselves are extremely dramatic of course and beautiful but but the way the Gospel tells it is it just okay that happened and then they just move on to the next thing they don't spend pages and pages telling us how people reacted to the fact that Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead they're just moving on really quickly and then Jesus is arrested and here we are at the climax of the story right if somebody was if this was being written by a novelist or screenwriter or something this is the climax we have Jesus arrested by his enemies God incarnate arrested standing trial and here's his chance to deliver one last great monologue or speech right in front of his enemies while they're trying to trap him and he could kind of stand up there with everyone looking at him but what happens that's the way it would go if somebody was making up this story they wouldn't be able to resist this opportunity for this climactic scene but that's not what happens he just he just remains silent for the most part Jesus throughout his entire passion he really says very little and what he does say and how he does react it's very understated he slapped across the face by some servant and he says you know what what have I done I haven't done anything wrong if I haven't done anything wrong why are you hitting me I mean that's his response this opportunity for drama is seemingly wasted and and then he goes off and he dies and then he comes back from the dead and okay here we go now's another chance for some great scenes again this is being written by somebody somebody telling a story making up a story and they've got and they've got their God they invented coming back from the dead okay what's he gonna do he's gonna go to the Pharisees and he's gonna say see I told you so and there's gonna be scene with the Pharisees that are just are you know just collapse and shock and maybe he gives another Sermon on the Mount kind of a sequel I mean he'd do something write something but no he he mostly just eats fish with his apostles the very little happens and even when he and then and then and then of course he ascends into heaven which is a another scene which you would expect a lot of drama but that's not the way that's not the way scripture tells it you know he the scripture this this is what scripture tells gee now this is Jesus Christ ascending into heaven and he said and it says when he had said this as they were looking on he was lifted up and a cloud took him from their sight that's it but that's the entire story of him ascending into heaven there's no more aren't any more sentences fleshing out what that looked like and there were you know just nothing it's just he ascended into heaven and then that's it and then immediately we're told to so they're looking up and there's in there and they're in shock that Jesus just ascended into heaven and then he's gone and and then there are two men in white robes two angels that appear and say what are you guys looking at okay now let's get to work guys come on stop dwelling on it let's get to work on a very shallow level you see that and you say now that's not what would actually happen what are you talking about I mean there'd be a lot more to it right but then you realize no this is this is this is the way that it's told if it's just true the Gospel writers are just telling us what happened that's all they're not they're not fiction writers they're just telling you they're reporting the facts and the facts are the facts Jesus because he is true he is real he confounds his critics he subverts expectations he doesn't fit into any kind of box he's not doing what you would think he would do he's not doing the things that anyone would ever predict he's just he's real this is just what was and still is and that's all and that's the way that it's relayed in the Bible and I think when you really read the Bible after a while you begin to appreciate that fact a third thing about doubt we are mortal beings and we have an extremely finite capacity for understanding we will never be able to fully comprehend the mysteries of God don't listen to anyone who says they have it all figured out because they don't and anyone who claims to is a charlatan and a false prophet and we should steer very clear of them but also don't listen to anyone who says well there shouldn't be any mysteries in your faith that's a cop-out what do you mean it's a mystery that's a cop I need you to explain the Trinity three persons in one explain that three persons in one but you're saying it's monotheistic not polytheistic explain that how's that possible you need to explain it exactly can't just say mystery don't listen to that either because no matter what we believe all of us myths must submit ourselves to the mysteries of life we all have to deal with the fact that so much of life is mysterious and that goes for atheists too and atheists cannot say how we came into being you can't say how human beings gained consciousness he can't say where love and joy and despair and morality originate he can't tell you how a trillion in possibilities all came together so that you and I could come into existence you can't explain how inanimate matter became animate he can't explain chaos and how that became order and how unconscious became consciousness he can't say what the universe is or why it exists or why we exist or how he just has faith he has to have faith he has his explanation that he cannot prove and he just has faith it's not like nobody has ever observed or seen or demonstrated how in animate material could become sentient that's never been that's never been no one has ever observed that in fact we know scientifically it's impossible there might be a lot of science fiction about oh maybe one day we'll create a robot that's sentient and has like a human conscious no no that's never going to happen it's impossible you cannot build something with metal and you know wiring that will become sentient you can't do that because that's sentience is not a physical thing you can't create it at a physical matter yet we know somehow sentience did come into being we all know that we're sentient so atheists have their explanation that is based entirely in faith they cannot demonstrate it it is not scientific and their explanation is physically scientifically impossible yet they believe it but there's a difference in our faith okay the secular world has a faith based on pride it cannot answer very many questions or explain very many things or describe how any of this came into being but it assumes based on arrogance and ego that it cannot be due to a force greater than themselves so it looks at the world and it says surely there cannot be a Power greater than myself so however this stuff came into being it must not have anything to do with any power that transcends myself but the religious person looks at the world and says surely there must be a Power greater than myself I have so little control over anything in my life I understand so little yet here I am and here is everyone and here's the world here's civilization here's the ocean here are mountains here are animals and in the human brain and a billion fantastic and incomprehensible things I can see the design I can see that I'm a part of it but I know I didn't make it somebody must have religious faith grows from humility and this is what you know the Atheist idea that they desperately cling to that somehow even though it's impossible dust somehow through some accidental process became over time human consciousness they cling to that because they are desperate to still at the end of the day they themselves still want to be top dog in the universe they cannot see that place to anyone religious faith grows from humility and that's why I think we first have to have faith in God before we can understand anything about him so it goes faith first than understanding well we try to do a lot of a lot of the time this is a mistake that people have been making since the time of Christ is where you try to flip that around and you say well let me understand first and then I'll have faith make me understand and then fine I'll have faith but first of all that's not faith if you just know you have full comprehension somehow of the omnipotent God and you're able somehow to wrap your head around all of that well then there's no faith involved faith faith is to submit yourself to this thing that is greater than yourself and that you cannot fully understand but if we have faith and we kneel before God then over time he will give us more and more understanding we'll never have perfect understanding we'll never have a complete understanding but we'll have more and more understanding over time and he gives us that understanding just because you know because we have opened ourselves to it we humble ourselves before the mystery of God we accept with submission and obedience the things we don't know and can never know or understand with faith and then over time more more understanding grows but it's not an understanding the reason that God gives us understanding in that case and not before is because when we demand understanding before faith then it's kind of like blackmail to God we're saying oh you want me to believe well then you better you know hey you've got to pony up and show me some miracles or something that's not the right attitude but he gives us understanding after faith because he knows that with that understanding it's not like something that we're demanding so that will believe in him but just so that the more that we understand the more that we can just be in awe of the beauty and wonder of God so we always have to recognize the origin of doubt which is pride it's that part of our brain that says this is challenging this is difficult this via this is beyond my power of understanding so therefore it can't be true now the Atheist gives in completely to this part of his brain the Christian fights against it by the grace of God so I think that's the answer to doubt don't try to reason your way out of it don't argue with yourself don't go researching the historical proofs of Jesus and so forth there's nothing wrong with researching those things it's a very good thing to research but not as an answer to doubt if we research to cure doubt then we're still relying on our own understanding and were demanding proof and the doubts will only intensify because we're looking for answers where they cannot be and we're looking for answers in the wrong way instead we have to simply bring our doubts to God humble ourselves and say Lord I'm weak I'm frail I'm foolish you know please strengthen my faith I we just come to God empty-handed with nothing and just say god I got nothing and if we do that you know that kind of prayer well we just come to God in humility and submission recognizing our own frailty our own weakness and we come to him asking for not asking for you know we're not asking for a job promotion we're not asking to win the lottery we're not asking for any material benefit whatsoever we're just saying God just give me please give me faith give me faith so I can glorify you all the more give me faith so I can be more of a light to those around me and God will always answer that prayer they'll always answer that and that's really enough it doesn't need to be specific the prayer I mean I you know I know some Christians think that our prayers need to be super specific all the time god I want this I want this I want this I want this okay like a child making a Christmas list or something but Jesus tells us that the father already knows what we want before we even ask for it so sometimes that the purest prayer is just to take our brokenness our doubts our pride our whole being and bring them to God in our hearts and then just be there in his presence contemplating him and his divinity and that's it that's the prayer I know in the past that you know I have in the past gotten two points in my life where there's just so much fog so much anxiety there's just this this tangle of knots in my head and in my soul and I'm so confused and so lost that there was a point where I felt like you know I can't even pray anymore because I don't even know what to say or what where to begin there's just you know I didn't even know I don't know what I even need or how to ask for it but eventually I figured out that that God is God and he doesn't need my explanations he doesn't need my speeches he doesn't need me to persuasively argue you know my case for what I want in my prayer all he needs me to do is just come to the cross kneel before it and say I'm here Lord I'm here change me although we should always be very careful with that prayer to change me prayer it's a dangerous prayer because it's so effective because if you bring that to God and you mean it he'll do it he'll do it in ways you didn't expect so this is what we do with doubt and if we get that if we get into the habit of always bringing everything to God and praying unceasingly he will give us a deeper knowledge of his presence and a deeper sense of it and we may not be able to explain it we may not be able to prove it he may not give us this knowledge accompanied by brilliant intellectual arguments so that we can argue in favor of it although maybe he will but for most of us he won't but he'll still give us that knowledge a knowledge that transcends proof and then something really crazy happens because you get to the point as your faith grows because we remember that you know faith is a is a not a stagnant thing faith is a living breathing growing thing and as your faith grows you get to the point where even when you doubt you still know even when you doubt you still believe even when you have doubts you still have faith that doesn't change the faith is there because you've given yourself to God you're holding on to him he's holding on to you you still have that faith and so those doubts are just they're coming from the outside and they're bombarding your brain but it doesn't change the fact that you're holding tight and we become like I think Peter and what I think is one of the most beautiful passages in the Gospels and I you know I love Peter in the Gospels I think Peter is is he's such a great and relatable figure because he's you know he's kind of kind of brash and he kind of talks without without thinking sometimes and he's obviously he's weak you know he has he has he betrayed Christ so he's got cowardice as well but he's also got courage when you think about think about it when Jesus was arrested before and then Peter would turn around and deny Christ three times but before that he lashes out with a sword he cuts somebody's ear off to try to defend Christ because he loves Christ so much he still has his weakness as a human being but he loves him in that moment it's just instinct like no you're not going to touch that's what makes Peter sub relatable is that he's just human he's a human being he's a so there's this scene in the Gospels after Jesus tells the crowd that he's the bread of life and whoever consumes this bread will be saved and the crowds hear this and they revolt and many of his followers were told leave him that day because they just they cannot accept even some of these had witnessed miracles but they cannot accept this teaching because they just don't understand it and it's so far outside of their conception of things and so they just get up and they leave and they say no I know no way so everyone's leaving and then you can kind of imagine how this plays out but just the crowd things everyone's leaving they're walking away mumbling to each other I mean this is you know saying oh this guy's crazy that's that's nuts and they all walk away and then Jesus turns to the twelve who are still standing there and he says what about you are you gonna leave too and then Peter answers him Peter doesn't say oh no Christ I mean we totally understand what you were just saying there I mean we get it okay those other people like they're just there that you know they're too stupid to understand but we understand we're totally with you no he doesn't give that kind of confident answer instead he just says Lord where else would we go you have the words of eternal life we know that you're the Holy One of God where else would we go and that was his answer it was a simple helpless answer not an entirely confident answer but it was an honest one it's Peter just throwing up his hands and saying what else am I going to go Jesus I I'm in too deep you're the Messiah I know that I I have no you just said I have no idea what that means in fact half of the stuff you say I have no idea what any that means it sounds pretty scary to be honest a lot of it but um but your god I know that and so I'm here and I think that was a very crucial moment for the Apostles right they're encountering this very difficult doctrine but saying no we're staying here it's not a perfect journey after that there's still doubt they're still denial there's betrayal all of that still lays ahead but there's also persistence in the Apostles there's weakness there's cowardice too but there's persistence where they keep coming back to Christ they keep turning back to him and I think that's what we have to do we admit to God I don't understand this I I can't wrap my head around this it doesn't make sense to me there's a part of my brain rebelling saying this can't be true and we just bring that to God we admit we might as well admit it he knows anyway what we're thinking no point trying to hide it so you might as well just bring it to God and say yeah you know that's those are the thoughts going on in my head I don't like it but it's there and we entrust ourselves to him and we say God I'm confused I'm bewildered my ego is shouting these doubts at me but where am I to go I'm still here with you show me the way and and I will follow you through the dark and I think that's faith even when the doubts appear so anyway I hope that was an acceptable answer we'll certainly a long one so I'll leave it there have a great weekend guys
