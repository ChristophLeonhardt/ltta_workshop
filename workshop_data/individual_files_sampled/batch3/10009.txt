was killed my son Daniel was killed at Columbine in 1999 and it occurred to me that in trying to strengthen our gun laws what I was doing was walking in Daniel shoes I actually have two pair of shoes here today the one pair of shoes the white shoes here are the shoes that were in his closet and for the first five years after Columbine whenever I would speak at rallies or when I would go to the state legislature to to lobby I've been wearing those shoes five years after Columbine I was given his final effects and that included he hits the shoes he was wearing that day so that's what I'm wearing now you know I really want them to understand this is a business a personal issue this isn't about ideology this is about the loss of life and really that it's shameful it is shameful than America goes through this level of gun violence the way that we do you
