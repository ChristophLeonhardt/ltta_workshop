1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:04,950
Imagine a CSI investigation 
— this famous TV program —

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,060
where the investigators
don’t have the murder weapon,

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,220
don’t have the place, don’t
have access to the victims.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,530
How the hell do you
investigate that?

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,440
It's impossible!

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,946
(Narrator) Late 2016, Havana.

7
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:23,180
(in background) Dr. Rosenfarb, are you aware
of any type of technology

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,432
that would cause this?

9
00:00:24,432 --> 00:00:25,140
No, I’m not, sir.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,240
American diplomats
were complaining

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,880
of crushing headaches,
extreme fatigue.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,750
Who would do this?

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,415
And an intense sound.
Secretary Tillerson ordered

14
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:37,140
the departure of
non-emergency personnel...

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,280
The Cubans?

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,950
They said they knew
nothing about it.

17
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,210
Sporadic attacks
continued until late April.

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,550
But that sound is
why this building

19
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,000
is nearly empty at this
important moment for Cuba.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,340
For the first time in 60 years,
its leader will not be a Castro.

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,630
Two things we know for sure.

22
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,240
Here’s what the US government
has said about the sound.

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,996
People were hurt, and the Cuban
government knows who did it.

24
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,370
Whatever happened
to these people

25
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,790
happen as a result of some
sophisticated technology that,

26
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,300
quite frankly, is
so sophisticated we

27
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,430
don’t understand it.

28
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,210
It leads to then —

29
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,370
In Washington, Senator Marco
Rubio convened a hearing.

30
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,900
Was the early opinion of
the security professionals

31
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,360
who looked at it that it was
likely a form of harassment.

32
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,380
OK.

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,130
In late 2016, staff at the
United States Embassy in Havana

34
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,600
began complaining
of strange noises,

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,800
and among the descriptions
that they complained of,

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,530
high pitched beam
of sound or just

37
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,490
intense pressure in one ear.

38
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,840
There are 24 Americans, who
during their time in Havana,

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,230
have experienced symptoms
that are consistent with what

40
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,740
you have seen in mild traumatic
brain injury and/or concussion.

41
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,010
Doctors said that diplomats’
brain matter had actually

42
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,150
changed.

43
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,999
What started out as a
mysterious nuisance —

44
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:54,790
We know it happened

45
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,480
to 24 people —

46
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,230
— became a suspected
instrument of attack.

47
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,220
Tillerson reacted as
he would have reacted

48
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,480
when he was an oil executive.

49
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,570
He heard something
happen in an oil rig.

50
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,540
Get everybody out of there.

51
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,990
Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson ordered his staff.

52
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,510
We are convinced these
were targeted attacks.

53
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,830
We don’t like our
diplomats being targeted.

54
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,800
Depart your post, he said.

55
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,180
Leave Cuba.

56
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,500
And they did.

57
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,720
Everyone from the people
who discussed trade down

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,820
to those who processed visas.

59
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,810
The incident had
become political.

60
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,980
This is entirely about the
health, and the safety,

61
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,330
and the well-being of Americans.

62
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,650
We still have an
investigation that’s underway.

63
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,180
So I hope Cuba would focus
instead on helping us

64
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,000
with the investigation and be
less concerned about claiming

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,988
this is political.

66
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:08,701
[music]

67
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:10,940
So here the contrast,
the contrast which is —

68
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,600
Carlos Alzuguray was a
Cuban diplomat for decades.

69
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,600
He’s a bit of an unofficial
government spokesperson.

70
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,000
Why throw down the embassy?

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,830
The bad thing about it is
that probably the guys who

72
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,840
have been affected more
are the regular Cubans, not

73
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,950
the government.

74
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,260
By the time the diplomats
left, the warming

75
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,580
started by President Obama
had undeniably chilled.

76
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,400
The US issued a travel
advisory, and tourism dropped.

77
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,990
On the streets of
Havana, the idea

78
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,420
that Cuba was involved
in a sonic attack

79
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,160
was met with skepticism.

80
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,589
It wasn’t long after the
incident became public

81
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,780
that sound experts
began downplaying

82
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,150
the idea of a sonic attack.

83
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,270
Sound can’t easily change brain
matter, among other reasons.

84
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,970
You’ve got a long, long
way to go before you even

85
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,080
attribute this to sound.

86
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,480
It’s not going to
cause physical effects.

87
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,290
If the sound goes through
air before reaching you,

88
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,570
it’s not going to cause that.

89
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,530
As I said, you can’t —

90
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,980
It may have been a
situation where people were

91
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,360
drawn more closely together.

92
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,430
It wasn’t only the sound
experts who struggled

93
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,640
to explain what happened.

94
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,940
Infectious cause is
what I would say.

95
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,680
Engineers also tried.

96
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,570
It could have just
been a malfunctioning

97
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,030
ultrasonic device, perhaps
used for some other nefarious

98
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,530
purpose.

99
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,300
And psychologists.

100
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,920
Well, these people
were on an island.

101
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,900
Fears can spread
in a tight group.

102
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,670
Things can get more intensified.

103
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,020
Anything is possible.

104
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,150
A microwave expert.

105
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,860
If you direct a
beam of microwave,

106
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,930
the microwave would
produce an acoustic wave.

107
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,370
This doctor said it could
have just been a virus.

108
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,390
An infection of some type.

109
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,150
So ultrasonic weapon
is not science fiction.

110
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,980
I could build one.

111
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,270
I can put it in the house
of somebody I didn’t like,

112
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,750
and I could annoy them.

113
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,650
What really seems
science-fiction is the idea

114
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,740
that you could build an
ultrasonic rifle that

115
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,450
will shoot 100 meters and
target somebody, and shoot

116
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,730
through a wall and get
just that one person.

117
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,250
Dr. Leighton was
referring to this hotel,

118
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,490
where some diplomats
reported hearing the sound.

119
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,900
Look up.

120
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,180
It’s unlikely you could
direct a weaponized sound

121
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,690
wave across this street 11
stories up through walls

122
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,510
and windows and hit
individuals repeatedly

123
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,914
without anyone noticing.

124
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,630
The US wouldn’t share
any evidence of an attack

125
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,530
with the Cubans.

126
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,076
So they did their
own investigation.

127
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,590
For reference, 140 decibels is
about the sound of a plane’s

128
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,712
jet engine at takeoff.

129
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:46,480
You ask what we think is
that some people are ill,

130
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,480
and there was a
psychogenic contagion.

131
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,820
And other people
started reporting

132
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,500
that they were feeling ill.

133
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,730
These are English
speaking communities

134
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,800
that are relatively isolated
from the Cuban population.

135
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,160
They live among themselves.

136
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,820
They exchange.

137
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,190
And any kind of
anxiety or stress —

138
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,960
Doctor Sosa is
referring to mass hysteria,

139
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,920
a psychological condition.

140
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,850
There was no, quote
unquote, attack.

141
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,400
This theory is actually
the current official Cuban

142
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,590
standpoint.

143
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,330
Today, the lights are
on at the embassy,

144
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,070
but the doors remain locked.

145
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,540
The administration’s
reaction to all of this

146
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,950
is so drastic to make permanent
the drawdown of the US embassy

147
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,130
to ridiculously low,
unnecessary levels, which

148
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,840
has an element of spite to it.

149
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,730
Fulton Armstrong is a former
CIA analyst who covered Cuba.

150
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,400
He made a career in
searching for motives.

151
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,530
They were so desperate
to make their case

152
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,030
that it was sonic attacks.

153
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,260
This is serious stuff.

154
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,230
You’re accusing them of
doing line of sight attacks

155
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,930
with a weapon that
no one knows exists.

156
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,120
So once the political
people got stuck

157
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,280
in their own internal
contradictions,

158
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,890
it was almost
impossible, then, to get

159
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,290
a real serious discussion
of what was going on.

160
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,270
The administration
had already decided

161
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,980
it was going to use it, the
legitimate symptoms of US

162
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,250
government officials for
a political maneuver that

163
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,500
looks like a lot of
other political things

164
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,060
that this
administration has done.

165
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,710
And that is, at any cost,
undo what the predecessor did.

166
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,210
There are a number of people
in the administration, and some

167
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,550
in Congress, who didn’t want to
see normalization of relations.

168
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,820
So for those who
didn’t like the policy

169
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,850
changes by President
Obama’s administration,

170
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,780
it’s worked out pretty well.

171
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,558
You have the State
Department work

172
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:45,590
practically all the major
executive jobs have not

173
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,520
been covered.

174
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,900
It’s the perfect situation
for someone like Marco Rubio

175
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,910
to hijack a policy and push.

176
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,300
And so it leads you to conclude
that the Cuban government

177
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,850
either did this, or
they know who did it.

178
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,940
And they can’t say.

179
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,160
Marco Rubio got his way.

180
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,420
Sometimes, in US politics,
the strongest voice

181
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,840
is the voice that
predominates even when

182
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,550
the bureaucracy isn’t with you.

183
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,840
Whoever did this —

184
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,170
The bureaucracy has
allowed the political voice

185
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,450
to come in and dictate
a lot, including

186
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:26,790
analysis of the so-called
sonic attacks issue.

187
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,680
And then it leads you down
the road of motivation.

188
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,650
It makes you start to
think, who would do this?

189
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,760
Who would do this?

190
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,220
Someone who doesn’t
like our presence there,

191
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,710
and someone who wants there
to be this sort of friction

192
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,220
between the US.

193
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,830
So who would be motivated
to create friction?

194
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,870
Or who would not be in
favor of an increased US

195
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,180
presence in Cuba?

196
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,780
We don’t want to be
in this position.

197
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,770
We have no choice.

198
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,860
We cannot send Americans
into Foreign Service

199
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,610
and their relatives to a country
where their safety cannot be

200
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,390
guaranteed.

201
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,570
Senator Rubio, a
son of Cuban exiles,

202
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,330
has been a longtime critic
of the Castro government.

203
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,720
He’s always been an opponent of
reestablishing ties with Cuba.

204
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,180
Now, I’m not under
any fantasy that Cuba

205
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,172
is going to transition
from one day to the next

206
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:14,630
and turn into
Canada, but there has

207
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,319
to be progress in
that direction.

208
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:18,860
And there’s never been a step
in that direction to the extent

209
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,715
that they’ve taken these steps,
they’ve been largely cosmetic.

210
00:10:21,715 --> 00:10:23,840
And they’ve retreated from
some of those positions.

211
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,000
So who would be motivated
to create friction?

212
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,022
Or who would not be in favor
of an increased US presence?

213
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:30,230
Maybe it was a third country.

214
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,230
Which third country would
want to disrupt the US

215
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,590
presence there?

216
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,100
And the logical conclusion
is Russia and Vladimir Putin.

217
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,790
Has the State Department raised
attacks against US personnel

218
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,574
in Cuba with the
Russian government?

219
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:43,740
That’s a very good question.

220
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
I think it would be better
to address that issue

221
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,090
in a classified setting.

222
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,347
Why would the fact
or lack of existence

223
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:53,180
of a communication to
the Russian government

224
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,300
be something that we
can’t discuss in public?

225
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,700
To give you the full
reply would be required,

226
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,020
and I believe that would be more
appropriate in the classified

227
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,400
setting.

228
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,060
Has Raul Castro ever said to
any US diplomat I didn’t do it,

229
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,010
but it’s possible
that some of my guys

230
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,260
did it without me
knowing about it?

231
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,530
I do not believe that
communication has ever

232
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,220
occurred.

233
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,380
You don’t want to discuss
something that is not

234
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,560
in a proper setting, or
is that just you’re —

235
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
you’ve just never heard?

236
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,164
That is my recollection
that I’ve never heard that.

237
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:26,664
OK.

238
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,419
The meeting is adjourned.

239
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,340
The US has still not given
an official explanation

240
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,090
of the sound or
its intent, if any.

241
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,610
But its effect has
been to play a big part

242
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,400
in the current
disengagement with Cuba.

243
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,500
This is happening
at a pivotal moment.

244
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,040
Raul Castro is stepping
down, and Miguel Diaz-Canel

245
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,310
will likely be president.

246
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,980
The notion that we have
just a skeletal staff

247
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,600
at the embassy,
fewer people than we

248
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,520
had during the
time of isolation,

249
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,722
is just unconscionable.

250
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:09,930
Well, the transition is not —

251
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,490
I mean, it’s a one
party transition.

252
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,987
I mean the outcome's
not in doubt.

253
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:15,570
You know, you would love to see
a new generation of leadership

254
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,730
that begins to move in
the right direction,

255
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,480
and I think those moves would be
reciprocated by American policy

256
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,500
makers.

257
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,660
But it’s not going
to happen because

258
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,810
of a unilateral
American opening.

259
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,820
That was the flawed
thinking behind the opening

260
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,640
towards China, and China
today is no more democratic

261
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,770
and no more free than it was.

262
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,350
And that was not the experience
in the aftermath of the Obama

263
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,850
opening.

264
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,270
It did not lead to any
changes in governance

265
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,390
or on the economic condition
of Cubans in the big picture.

266
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,410
After more than five
very difficult decades,

267
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,840
the relationship
between our governments

268
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,568
will not be
transformed overnight.

269
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,440
What are we doing?

270
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,540
We’re pulling out of the game.

271
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,060
They would prefer
to buy American rice

272
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,790
and American chicken.

273
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,670
They would prefer to
have Americans come down

274
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,000
and do travel in Cuba.

275
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,210
They like us.

276
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,055
But if we’re going to
treat them in the way

277
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:14,430
that we’re treating them, they
will make their own future

278
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,980
without us.

279
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,770
They say they’ve been making
their future for the last 60

280
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,330
years without us, and
they’re prepared to do it,

281
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,660
perhaps with some hyperbole,
for another 60 years.

282
00:13:25,660 --> 00:00:00,000
