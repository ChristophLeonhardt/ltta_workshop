welcome back as we've said questions are swirling about whether there will be a delay and judge Cavanaugh's confirmation and whether we will hear publicly from judge Kavanaugh and his accuser Jordan V Naomi's Illinois Democratic senator Tammy Duckworth senator thank you for taking a few minutes you did tweet this out earlier I can put this up on the screen say these allegations are disturbing and deserve to be investigated before Cavanaugh's nomination moves forward the Senate committee must delay Thursday scheduled vote thank you dr. Ford for bravely coming forward to share your story so you want the delay my question is do you want there seems to be some debate here about how her allegations should be aired do you want a full public hearing similar to what we saw with Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas in 1991 where they both appear before the committee in full public session cameras rolling I think the public deserves to hear in from certainly dr. Ford in a full public hearing they've been hearing a lot from judge Kavanaugh so far I think she deserves her a day in a public setting I think that American people deserve nothing less especially when we were talking about appointing someone to a position for the rest of their life they into the highest court in the land in terms of the timetable then what is reasonable here thinking back to 291 the Anita Hill allegation came out on the 6th of October the committee reconvened for more hearings they were held the 12th to 14th basically a week later is that roughly the timetable you have in mind here when you talk about a delay in hearings well I think that we should take whatever amount of time we need in order to have the full hearing we don't shouldn't rush it I'm sure there might be other witnesses and remember as far as the hearing is concerned that's not the only then it needs to happen we need to have the FBI fully investigate the allegation as well you're one of your colleagues there in the Senate chuck Grassley the chairman of the Judiciary Committee he addressed this topic today and he's he's non-committal right now in terms of the action he's going to take but he's trying to put some of the onus back on Democrats back on your party specifically dianne feinstein of course dianne feinstein had been given this allegation over the summer she kept it to herself within her office until the last week grassley basically saying unfortunately committee Republicans have only known this person's identity from news reports for less than 24 hours and known about her allegations for less than a week senator Feinstein on the other hand has had this information for many weeks and deprived her colleagues of the information necessary to do our jobs do you think he has a point there well I think he's missing the point that this was all at the request of dr. Ford herself you know I've dealt with military sexual trauma women who've been victims of sexual trauma in the military this is a common thing for victims that they are very reluctant to come forward and you read the text of the letter that dr. Ford sent to senator Feinstein she was very clear that she did not want to come forward she herself had said that she didn't make that decision until just this very weekend so I don't know that senator Feinstein had the ability to share that information with anybody else but now the dr. Ford has taken the very brave step of coming forward and willing to expose herself to public scrutiny she should be honored for her bravery but she should also be listened to as a potential victim we don't want to set a bad example for victims all around this country in this time when women and men also are coming forward to talk about the sexual assault that they under that they've been victims of and to really scare people from coming forward if they truly have become victims of a crime yeah I think that's an interesting point you're making because there has been I'd seen at least initially it may be where it may be dying down a little bit right now but some pretty loud criticism on the left at least initially of Dianne Feinstein in her decision not to turn that information over to make it public initially in her situation is that how you would handle it if you were if you were given information from a woman who said this happened to me I'm telling you about it but I don't want you telling your colleagues I don't want you bringing it up in these in these hearings is that how you would handle it I would certainly handle it much the same way that is I would turn over the information to the FBI which I understand senator Feinstein has done but I would first and foremost honor the victim remember that sexual crimes are a crime of power and we have to really protect the victim first and foremost and let her know that she had control she has to power in this situation if she doesn't want to come forward publicly then she has that decision to making that's her right to do that and again I just want to thank dr. Ford for her bravery in this last moment to come forward because she truly believed that she's compelled to do the right thing even at her own personal expense I'm just curious a being around there today as all this unfolds what is your sense of sort of the just politically speaking here the state of play on this right now do you do you sense Republicans are staying together and determined to get this through on a speedy timetable do you sense that there are cracks there what is your read on the situation well you know I I we're all just getting back into town right now I've not had a chance to really talk to any of my Republican colleagues so far I would just hope that they would react in the same way to this situation as they would have over the last you know months and year over the me2 movement with women coming forward the allegations of sexual misconduct I would hope that certainly the women of the Senate would come together and support a woman who's coming forward in a very difficult time dr. Ford to make these allegations we need to make sure that we support her first and foremost and that we take these allegations very seriously this is the this is the United States Senate if we don't take this seriously then who will in the rest of this country we have to set an example for the rest of the nation that we will not dismiss a victims claims that we will not whitewash and and sweep under the rug a victim of sexual misconduct just for the convenience of a timetable that's not the right thing to do here all right Tammy Duckworth Democratic senator from Illinois thank you for the time thank you for having me on hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more meat to press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on YouTube right now
