George papadopolis former Trump campaign aide has actually been sentenced he has gotten 14 days in jail it's not very long God ladies and gentlemen we got him Papadopoulos how the entire fortnight June yeah he's got he's got he's getting 1.4 scaramouche's in jail basically so also one year of supervised release and yada yada yada some other stuff or whatever but just 14 days for lying to the FBI about his involvement with you know Russians conversation and Trump campaign blah blah blah okay that seems fairly anticlimactic yeah and I'll tell you especially because first they gave evidence about Trump presumably on the campaign and so they got a plea deal and any pleaded guilty so it was like whoa paparazzo oh my God we're to give okay then later they seem to panic and his girlfriend came out and she's like Oh mr. Trump whatever you do what a pardon would be great and hey please please and so this is what they wanted a pardon for for 14 days so maybe they took it down from 12 years to 14 days the investigation lasted longer got more time in jail for lying right I think it was like during a deposition or something but he lied to the feds that should be a scary thing lying to the feds you should be in for I don't know if that makes it that scary also the feds you know they like to dole out punishment this is interest I really don't know what to do with this information right it's two weeks and two weeks for all of this now here's the first one maybe they're just getting warmed up I don't know but like two weeks it doesn't feel like I got me yeah so look it important context and then we'll have a little bit of fun with guessing things that probably aren't true so the context is that the reason he's getting 14 days is because he did cooperate prosecutors so obviously they got some sort of information that they found to be useful otherwise the sentence would not have been that light so I think that's the most important takeaway now the fun okay so if in the beginning they give them a deal but they haven't done the sentencing then he panics and he said please pardon report bijelo Trump and they had spoken out against Trump before that so changing their minds that asking for the pardon was an indication that they were gonna get a big sentence and at the end she and the girlfriend is there the fiance is going on TV all over the place saying the prosecutors basically implying that they lied to them so then it seemed like there was gonna be a big scary moment where they were gonna he was going to get a decade or something and then at the end he gets 14 days so did something happen between their panic and the 14 days where they gave more information mm-hmm well one quote that I saw and again we didn't even have formal write-ups of this really was he said that he couldn't guarantee that he hadn't said to trump or the campaign during the campaign anything about the dirt that the Russians had acquired I don't know if he said to the Muller investigators and the prosecutors or anything like that but he couldn't confirm coming out of this sentencing whether he had told them about it again I don't know what to do with that information I'm just telling you what happens and this is the reality of life you know I see so many court dramas where people are giving or cooperating with the police and the authorities and then it ends up leading to some kind of amazing dramatic moment but this is not the bang but the whimper this is just like 14 days and maybe we'll find out later but it is good to see that like there was something that happened without him it wouldn't you know he was the one that started all these you know as NPR writes dominoes falling but it's I guess it just keeps going there's something that happened out of it and we just need to keep paying attention as it proceeds so if you don't remember last piece of context here is that it Papadopoulos went and talked to some to an Australian diplomat Australian then went and told the US government hey this guy who's working on the Trump campaign has connections to the Russians that he's been telling me about you guys should go investigate the FBI then goes oh that's disconcerting you're the presidential campaign should not be talking to a foreign governments no matter who they are that starts the dominoes but and then the Trump team calls him a coffee boy and he's not a big deal so there is dispute that we still don't know the the answer to obviously and that's why we're partly speculating here as to how much he did know and how much he gave to Muller's team he clearly knew there was a connection to the Russians and they found a valuable enough to give him a deal and give him a very very light sentence if it was just hey the Russians are interested in giving us information I don't think he gets 14 days but if he does have something about how he told Trump the Russians have incriminating evidence about you well that would make it far more interesting and perhaps that's why we have the lighter sentence but for today all we know is he did cooperate and he got 14 days sentence the other thing we know is that went on his alias on his indictment his alias is coffee boy it was true I hear no no his coffee two easy ways for the Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you are notified of our videos you
