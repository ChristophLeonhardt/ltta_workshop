THE CHARGE CONTRADICTS HER CLAIM
BY THE PEOPLE THAT SHE SUPPLIED.
>> SO YOU WERE POINTING OUT,
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" HAS
JUST RELEASED AN EDITORIAL BY
BRETT KAVANAUGH.
HE SAYS, I AM AN INDEPENDENT
TOURIST, INDEPENDENT JUDGE.
HE SAYS AT THE TOP OF IT IN
ITALICS, HE SAID WHEN I SPOKE IN
THAT HEARING, HE'S BEEN
CRITICIZED FOR BEING TOO EMOTIVE
AND TOO ANGRY.
>> THE ARTICLE FOR TO BY BRETT
KAVANAUGH IS ON
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"
WEBSITE RIGHT NOW AND IT WILL BE
IN TOMORROW'S PAPER AND IS
ESSENTIALLY AND DEFENSE OF HIS
TEMPERAMENT.
HE SAID WHEN I SPOKE OF THE
DEMOCRATS I WAS PROTECTING MY
FAMILY AND MY NAME AND I
PROBABLY SAID A FEW THINGS THAT
I MAY BE SHOULD NOT HAVE.
BUT I'M MAKING IT CLEAR, I
BELIEVE IN THE RULE OF LAW AND
I'M AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE.
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPARTIAL
JUDGE AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO
SO.
>> HE IS ALREADY, AND THIS IS
ALL JUST PAYBACK FOR THE
CLINTONS, AND, THIS IS JUST
PROOF THAT WE JUST WANT TO GET
RID OF HIM NO MATTER WHAT.
WE ARE NOT TRYING TO GET RID OF
HIM, IT'S UP PERSONAL SMEAR.
THAT'S THE TEMPERAMENT THAT'S
WRONG.
I THOUGHT THAT ACTUALLY SEEING
THAT HUMAN SIDE OF HIM, WAS
COMFORTING TO ME.
IF HE HAD GONE UP THERE AND GONE
VERY ROBOTIC AND UNEMOTIONAL, I
THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EVEN
MORE DAMAGING TO HIM THAN WHAT
HE DID.
MAYBE YOU COULD SAY HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE HAD THE EXCHANGE HE PAD
WITH THE SENATOR, WHICH IS
PROBABLY TRUE.
AND, AS BILL SAYS, THERE'S
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE OF THESE
CHARGES.
THAT WOULD MAKE ANYONE SERIOUS.
>> THIS ISN'T GOING TO END.
WE SAW THE PROTESTERS IN
WASHINGTON SO EVEN IF HE DOES
SECURE HIS SEAT ON THE
SUPREME COURT AS A JUSTICE, I'M
IMAGINING THAT THE DAY HE HAS
HIS FIRST DAY IN COURT, THOSE
STEPS ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE
FLOODED WITH PROTESTERS.
I THINK THIS WILL BE VERY
INVIGORATING IN SOME WAYS TO
DEMOCRATS.
>> I THINK IT IS BUT I THINK
IT'S BEEN INVIGORATING THROUGH
REPUBLICANS, JUST FROM MY
INFORMAL NONPOLITICAL CONTACTS,
FROM WHAT PEOPLE SAY, ESPECIALLY
THE MOMS WHO HAVE SONS.
AND I THINK MARY ASKED A GOOD
POINT.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO OWE BRETT
KAVANAUGH APOLOGIES FOR THEIR
BEHAVIOR.
THE WAY THEY THROW AROUND UP
SUBSTANTIATED CHARGES, AND I'D
LIKE TO KNOW, WHEN HE GAVE THAT
SPEECH, I WANTED TO STAND UP AND
CHEER.
I KNOW HIM, I KNOW HIS WIFE, AND
I KNOW HIS KIDS.
I KNOW THAT'S NOT RIGHT, BUT
WHAT IS THE PROPER COMPORTMENT
FOR A MAN ACCUSED OF GAINING
RAPE WITH NO EVIDENCE?
I MEAN -- >> IT IS PRETTY TOUGH.
IN TERMS OF WHAT BILL TOUCHES
ON, DAN, HOW THE PRESS HAS
HANDLED THIS, BECAUSE THE PRESS
HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR HAVING A
PRETTY LOW BAR FOR WHAT COULD BE
PRINTED.
YOU KNOW WE HAVE LETTERS FROM
FRIENDS AND, I SAW HIM STAND
NEAR THE PUNCH.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
>> THE THING IS THEY KEEP
REPEATING EVERY STORY WRITTEN
THAT THE DETAILS OF THE
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST BRETT
KAVANAUGH, WHICH HAS AN EFFECT
AFTER A WHILE.
PEOPLE THINK THERE IS SOMETHING
HERE, AND FOR THAT REASON HE HAD
TO STAND UP AND DEFEND HIMSELF.
IF NOBODY IN THE PRESS WAS GOING
TO DO IT FOR HIM.
AND IN A LARGE PART, HE FEELS
HE'S GOT TO DEFEND HIMSELF
BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO SUPPORT
WHATSOEVER IN THE PRESS.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN REALLY A MAN WHO
SORT OF FOUGHT BACK AND ONE.
SO KEEP IN MIND, THESE ARE NOT
CORROBORATED ALLEGATIONS, BUT
BASICALLY INSINUATION HAS BEEN
ACCUSATION, HAS BEEN AN
INDICTMENT IN THESE CASES.
QUICK THOUGHTS ON THAT?
>> WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF THAT, WE
HAVE THE DUKE LACROSSE, THE
