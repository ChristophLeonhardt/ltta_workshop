1
00:00:02,037 --> 00:00:02,772
YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE SURPRISED

2
00:00:02,772 --> 00:00:05,341
BUT WE HAVE CONFIRMATION TONIGH

3
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:05,675
TONIGHT.

4
00:00:05,675 --> 00:00:07,243
WHEN THE SENATE DECIDED TO DELAY

5
00:00:07,243 --> 00:00:08,211
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION

6
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:10,646
VOTE FOR A WEEK IN ORDER TO

00:00:10,646 --> 00:00:12,215
ENABLE AN FBI INVESTIGATION,

8
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:14,050
EVERYONE WHO WAS NOT JEFF FLAKE

9
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,017
UNDERSTOOD THE POINT OF IT.

10
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:16,852
THE INVESTIGATION ITSELF WAS

11
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:17,420
IRRELEVANT.

12
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,222
FOR DEMOCRATS THE ONLY PURPOSE

13
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:20,823
WAS TO BUY TIME SO THAT NEW

14
00:00:20,823 --> 00:00:23,192
PEOPLE, SOME OF THIS ANONYMOUSLY

15
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:25,194
COULD MAKE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST

16
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:26,395
KAVANAUGH.

17
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:27,530
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND

18
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,065
WE'VE BEEN THE FIRST TO SCOFF AT

19
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:30,433
SOME OF THESE CLAIMS BECAUSE OF

20
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:31,200
SOME OF THEM FRIVOLOUS, SOME OF

21
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,603
THEM ABSURD.

22
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:34,370
TONIGHT WE MUST TELL YOU A NEW

23
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,807
AND TROUBLING STORY HAS EMERGED

24
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:38,541
THAT COULD ALTER THE TRAJECTORY

25
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,510
OF NOT SIMPLY THE KAVANAUGH

26
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,210
NOMINATION BUT THE HISTORY OF

27
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,779
THIS COUNTRY.

28
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:44,647
IT'S A STORY OF A YOUNG MAN

29
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:46,315
OUTWARDLY RESPECTABLE BUT SO

30
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:49,219
MORALLY DISTORTED WITHIN, SO

31
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,053
ADDLED BY CHRONIC DEPENDENCY ON

32
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:55,325
DRAFT BEER, THE WITNESSES SAY HE

33
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:57,327
COMMITTED A PARTICULARLY HEINOUS

34
00:00:57,327 --> 00:00:58,194
FORM OF ASSAULT IN A PUBLIC

35
00:00:58,194 --> 00:00:59,028
PLACE.

36
00:00:59,028 --> 00:01:00,530
THIS MAN, THIS MONSTER IN HUMAN

37
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,331
FORM ONCE TAUGHT THAT ICE CUBE

38
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:05,435
AT SOMEONE IN A BAR.

39
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:07,670
AN ICE CUBE, THE PERFECT WEAPON.

40
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,440
IN SOLID FORM, DEADLY.

41
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,741
AND THEN WITHIN HOURS IT MELTS

42
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:13,643
AND EVAPORATES INTO THE AIR, ALL

43
00:01:13,643 --> 00:01:16,146
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TURNS TO VAPO

44
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:16,446
VAPOR.

45
00:01:16,446 --> 00:01:17,780
THERE ARE NO FINGERPRINTS, IT IS

46
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,217
DIABOLICAL, THERE PERFECT CRIME.

47
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:21,784
FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL

48
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:24,821
STANDPOINT, IT IS DISQUALIFYING.

49
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:26,022
WE'LL CONCEDE WE MISSED THE

50
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:27,524
SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS STORY AT

51
00:01:27,524 --> 00:01:28,558
FIRST BUT THE OTHER NETWORKS

52
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:29,926

00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:33,797
WERE, WATCH THEIR COVERAGE.

SOMEONE'S FACE >> THROUGH ICE IN

57
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:39,469
SOMEONE'S FACE.

62
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,046
ON HIM FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON.

63
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:54,250
>> Tucker: ICE GATE.

64
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,453
THE FOUNDERS AND FRAMERS OF THE

65
00:01:56,453 --> 00:01:57,220
CONSTITUTION ANTICIPATED THIS

66
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,155
VERY MOMENT.

67
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:00,924
ARTICLE THREE, IN WORDS WELL

JUDICIARY."

75
00:02:14,938 --> 00:02:21,111
A FORMER YEAR      EL STUDENT WO

76
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:21,845
OVERLAPPED WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH

77
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:23,713
IN SCHOOL, HAS CONTACTED THE FBI

78
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:25,782
WITH A NEW OUTRAGE.

79
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:29,419
ONE TIME AT A FRAT PARTY, SOME

80
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,921
FRATERNITY BROTHERS HIRED A TO

81
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:32,789
PUT ON SOME KIND OF SHOW.

82
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:33,490
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH

83
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,060
BRETT KAVANAUGH?

84
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,197
AS HE CONCEDES, NOTHING.

85
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:41,865
I CAN'T SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT HE

86
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:44,067
WAS PRESENT IN THE FRAT HOUSE.

87
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:45,502
AND YET, THIS IS THE CRITICAL

88
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:48,005
PART OF THIS STORY.

89
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:49,606
BRETT KAVANAUGH MAY HAVE BEEN IN

90
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:50,340
THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT WHEN

91
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,242
THIS HAPPENED.

92
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:54,611
THE VERY SAME STATE AT THE VERY

93
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:55,579
SAME TIME THAT PEOPLE IN A

94
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,481
FRATERNITY HOUSE WERE DOING

95
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,116
THINGS THAT HE DIDN'T LIKE.

96
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:03,020
NEED WE SAY MORE?

97
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,188
TOTALLY AND UTTERLY

98
00:03:04,188 --> 00:03:05,222
DISQUALIFYING.

99
00:03:05,222 --> 00:03:05,689
STILL CONFUSED?

100
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,992
WATCH CNN THEY WILL EXPLAIN.

101
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:10,327
JULIE SWETNICK CLAIMS THAT 37

102
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:12,863
YEARS AGO FOR SOME REASON SHE

103
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:14,464
WENT TO TEN GANG RATE PARTIES IN

104
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:17,167
A ROW AND THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH

105
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:19,703
MAY HAVE BEEN AT SOME OF THEM.

106
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:25,476
WHAT DID HE DO AT THESE PARTIES?

107
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:28,645
JULIE SWETNICK SIGNED A SWORN

108
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:31,215
STATEMENT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH

109
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:31,982
AND FRIENDS ADDED DRUGS AND

110
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:36,420
ALCOHOL TO THE PUNCH.

111
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,422
THAT'S A SERIOUS CHARGE BUT AS

112
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:39,723
SWETNICK EXPLAINED IN A

113
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:40,457
TELEVISED INTERVIEW, SHE DIDN'T

114
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:42,259
MEAN IT.

115
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,995
>> I SAW HIM AROUND THE PUNCH --

116
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:46,096
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID.

117
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:51,435
I SAW HIM BUY THEM.

118
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:52,503
SPAY WHAT YOU'VE HEARD DEMOCRATS

119
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:56,006
TALK A LOT RECENTLY ABOUT HOW HE

120
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:57,841
MAY HAVE LIED UNDER OATH.

121
00:03:57,841 --> 00:03:59,943
THERE IS NOW QUITE A BIT OF

122
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:00,611
EVIDENCE THAT JULIE SWETNICK

123
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:02,146
JUST DID.

124
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:05,015
DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE, THEY

125
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:07,017
AREN'T INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT

126
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:09,119
BECAUSE WHATEVER WORKS, POWER IS

127
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,020
THE POINT.

128
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,056
THEY SHOULD CARE, SEXUAL ASSAULT

129
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:13,324
IS A HORRIFYING CRIME NO MATTER

130
00:04:13,324 --> 00:04:14,625
WHO COMMITS IT, ALL DECENT

131
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:18,028
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT.

132
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:18,696
FALSE CLAIMS TRIVIALIZE THE

133
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:20,865
OFFENSE AND THERE HAVE BEEN A

134
00:04:20,865 --> 00:04:21,798
NUMBER OF WIDELY PUBLICIZED

135
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:24,001
FALSE CLAIMS OVER THE PAST 15

136
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,035
YEARS.

137
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:26,036
THEY UNDERMINED THE MANY ASSAULT

138
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:27,705
VICTIMS WHO ARE TELLING THE

139
00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:28,439
TRUTH.

140
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,407
THEY MAKE THE SEARCH FOR JUSTICE

141
00:04:30,407 --> 00:00:00,000
SEEMED POLITICAL AND WORST OF
