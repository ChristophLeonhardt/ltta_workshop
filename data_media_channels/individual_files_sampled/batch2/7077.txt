this story is by far and away my favorite of the day Pastor John Kilpatrick of Church of his presence in Daphne Alabama posted an awesome video of himself first of all he's gonna accuse people of witchcraft which is already hilarious and then second he's gonna speak in tongues with the intention of protecting President Trump when Elijah faced Jezebel he was facing witchcraft when everybody to hear what I'm saying to you I don't know if you know this and I don't know if you don't believe me when I tell you this but what's happening right now in America is witchcraft trying to take this country over it's which crowd it's trying to take America back over and I want to tell you something else I am NOT being political but I don't see how president Trump bears the Thunder he's as strong as I have ever seen a man made but here's what the Holy Spirit said to me last night and here's what he said for me to tell you he said tell the church that so far Trump has been dealing with Ahab but Jezebel's fixing to step out from the shadows that's what the Lord said to me and I couldn't understand the other day when I was preaching in Houston why I felt something so much on this one I was preaching I felt a real powerful function on me when I was preaching this about intimidation or I was preaching this about containment but then last night when the Lord gave me this about the witchcraft the Lord said he's been dealing with this but he said pray for him now because he said yet there's about to be a shift and the deep state is about to manifest and it's going to be a showdown like you can't believe so I'm coming to you as a prophet as a man of God and I'm telling you it's time to pray for the president oh my god I heard the Lord say there's gonna be an attempt to take him out of power let's stand and pray right now shout out about Robert are about yond oh come on help me out right now once you lift your voice everybody help me pray come on help me pray Church I don't want you pray in two minutes I want you to pray come on help shout out about Ramos probably under my mind about my son no hopefully they be unde a man it's time to play turn I believe our nation is in the balances about of aerobic Oribe under Manor on a bus unabomb I under shut up I'm on the whole domicile Amanda Reed out of a puddle myun-day McGovern of a suburb of mikata in the name of Jesus Christ Lord Holy Spirit Holy Spirit Holy Spirit let's see make this man like of Moses unintimidated buy me a bottle of a Sunnah mama beyond Oh in the name of Jesus the humble Ramayana mama mama by a time a sort of am i under sheep bah-bah-bah hit the cup oh shut up animus on top who could watch that and not conclude that religions aren't large cults I mean that's what that is that's a large cult they all got together and they're all fucking playing into the same delusion ah that's so creepy but also so hilarious at the same time I think the shots of the audience creeped me out the most because it's like they're all playing the same game and pretending to be under the same trance and they're all like talking and fucking doing the making this gestures towards the sky and like Lord protect my dear president I love me some true and then I like how when he speaks in tongues this dude speaks in tongues but he he just keeps saying like the same sounding speaking in tongues thing if that makes sense he always ends with Biondo he's like a shaba daba Diliberto by under and it's like dude if you're speaking in tongues you got to switch it up every now and then throw a throw a flagon farthing newton a la ba la CIMA dama dingo bordeaux hit him with a gotta hit him with something different so it looks like God is speaking through you and making you say ridiculous things and not the same kind of pattern and then also I like when he does that little Richard woof he can't stop that he's stupid okay so I like how at the beginning he's talking about witchcraft all the people doing witchcraft coming after President Trump we got to protect our president from this witchcraft now let's try to summon spirits to detect him and make funny noises with our mouths isn't that kind of like you doing witchcraft like that it I mean you're trying that's what it looks like you're attempting to do now we're talking to the actual God not the did not the dark demons that witchcraft people do so talking about witchcraft is hilarious because you're a grown-ass man and that's a roomful of grown-ass people and they're acting like no seriously the witches are all lining up against Donald Trump and then I like how he'll the guy also says that the Lord spoke to him about President Trump if there is a God and that's how he's spending his time not very godly is it I'm gonna go I'm gonna try to go find this this awkward pastor in Daphne miss Daphne Alabama who looks like he's wearing a wig and tailed I I got a whisper to this dude cuz he's special if anybody's special enough to have a line to the almighty Pastor Kilpatrick in Daphne Alabama dude you don't speak to God you don't speak to God you don't speak to God and I always wonder how many people in that audience really think that this guy does speak to God are they all like God listen closely when Pastor speaks cuz he's got a direct line to the Almighty do people really think that it looks like they really I mean they're all playing in that tongues game and they're all put tongues game sounds really dirty last thing I would ever want to do is play a tongue game with this dude sabudana shiva la banda you can't say that occasionally fundamentalists don't give us entertainment because even though they're dangerous in many respects they also are kind of funny
