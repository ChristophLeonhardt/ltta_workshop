COLLUSION BUT THESE FINDINGS

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,736
SIGNAL THE END TO HIS PROBE.

11
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:25,841
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM THIS

12
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:26,175
RELEASE?

13
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:26,709
HERE IS TOM FITTON.

APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

16
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:34,617
A COUPLE THINGS EXPECTED TO COME

17
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,585
OUT OF THIS, WHETHER THERE WERE

18
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:41,991
CLEAR INCIDENTS OF COLLUSION

19
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:42,691
BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP

20
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:43,325
CAMPAIGN AND WHETHER THE

21
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:45,161
PRESIDENT TOOK ANY ACTION

22
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:45,828
CONSTITUTING OBSTRUCTION OF

23
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:47,730
JUSTICE BUT AS WE SAID IT MAY

24
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:48,464
NOT END AND THE FINDINGS MAY NOT

25
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:52,935
BE PUBLIC.

26
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:53,669
>> THEY MAY NOT BE PUBLIC IN THE

27
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:02,912
SENSE THAT IF HE GIVES ANYTHING

28
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:03,646
TO ROD ROSENSTEIN AS REGULATIONS

29
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,648
REQUIRE, CERTAINLY HAVE TO MAKE

30
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:06,348
THEM PUBLIC BUT THERE WILL BE

31
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:07,049
PUBLIC PRESSURE TO MAKE THEM

32
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:14,223
PUBLIC FROM THE PUBLIC AND

33
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:15,591
CONGRESS, MAY BE VERY HOSTILE TO

34
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:18,227
THE PRESIDENT.

35
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:19,462
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING NEW AFTER

36
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:22,231
THE ELECTION THAT WE ALREADY

37
00:01:22,232 --> 00:01:24,366
DON'T KNOW.

38
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:25,000
THERE IS NO COLLUSION, NO

39
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:30,206
OBSTRUCTION BUT THERE IS A

40
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:30,940
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION,

41
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:34,543
IMPEDING THE FUNCTIONS OF THE

00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:35,277
PRESIDENCY AND SOMETHING WE HAVE

43
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:36,145
BEEN SAYING AT JUDICIAL WATCH,

44
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:40,516
IT NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN.

45
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,150
IT WAS CORRECTLY FORMED,

46
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:46,222
SIMPSON, A KEY FIGURE IN SETTING

47
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:46,856
UP THE MUELLER OPERATION

48
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:50,226
RESULTED IN HIS GETTING A

49
00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:55,097
DOSSIER INTO THE FBI'S HANDED

50
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:55,698
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

51
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,398
COORDINATING TO TARGET TRUMP,

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,234
TAKING THE FIFTH AMENDMENT.

53
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:01,370
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY WITNESSES

54
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,104
HAVE TO BE COMPROMISED, HOW MANY

55
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:02,838
ETHICAL COMPROMISES HAVE TO TAKE

56
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,508
PLACE IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

57
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:06,208
AND FBI IN THE APPOINTMENT OF

58
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:11,013
MUELLER BEFORE WE START

59
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:11,714
QUESTIONING THE BASIS OF THIS

60
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,049
OPERATION.

61
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,650
>> LET'S LOOK AT THOSE

62
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:15,384
INSTANCES, WE PUT IT IN WRITING

63
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,118
AND LET THE GRAPHIC OF ALL THOSE

64
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:20,322
THAT WERE COMPROMISED AND THE

65
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:21,056
REASONS IT SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN,

66
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,224
YOU HAVE JIM COMEY WHO WAS

67
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:26,262

FIFTH AS WELL.

72
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:38,440
THERE ARE REASONS FOR WHY THIS

73
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:39,041
SHOULD JUST BE STOPPED

74
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:43,445
ALTOGETHER.

75
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:44,146
>> JUST YESTERDAY WE HAD TWO

76
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:47,850
TREASURY OFFICIALS IMPLICATED IN

77
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:48,551
CRIMINAL LEAKS OF INFORMATION.

78
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:53,622
THESE GUYS WERE HELPING MUELLER

79
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:54,290
IN HIS OPERATION, THEY ARE

80
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,560
LEAKING FINANCIAL INFORMATION

81
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:58,260
FROM THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT

82
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,896
ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY IS GOING

83
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:03,198
BACK TO COMEY HE WAS NOT ONLY

84
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:10,205
FIRED BUT DOCUMENTS IN THE FBI

85
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:13,676
FILES, LEAKED THEM AND THAT LED

86
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:14,410
TO THE APPOINTMENT OF MUELLER SO

87
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:15,144
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY LEADING TO THE

88
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:18,314
APPOINTMENT AND ROD ROSENSTEIN

00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:24,086
SENSE HE IS A WITNESS TO THE

91
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:24,753
INVESTIGATION HE APPOINTED

92
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:26,221
MUELLER TO CONDUCT.

93
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:26,922
>> NOT UNBELIEVABLE, YOU ARE

94
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:30,192
LOOKING AT SITUATIONS LIKE THIS

95
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:30,926
GOING BACK TO THE CLINTON EMAIL

00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:36,498
INVESTIGATION AND THE STATE

97
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:37,199
DEPARTMENT PROVIDING CLEARLY

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,233
FALSE STATEMENTS TO DELEON

99
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:38,968
REQUESTS FOR CLINTON DOCUMENTS,

100
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,736
THAT IS A QUOTE FROM A SHOCKED

101
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,204
FEDERAL JUDGE YESTERDAY.

102
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:50,145
>> THERE WAS A COURT HEARING

103
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:50,846
FRIDAY, WE WERE ASKING JUDGE

104
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:51,547
LAMBERT FOR DISCOVERY IN OUR

105
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:55,284
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT CASE

106
00:03:55,285 --> 00:03:59,321
ABOUT THE BENGHAZI SCANDAL, THAT

107
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,055
CASE HAD BEEN COMPROMISED BY THE

108
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:01,790
FACT THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT

109
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,994
WAS MISLEADING TO US IN THE

110
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:10,599
COURTS ABOUT THIS EMAIL ISSUE

111
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,233
AND THE COURT WAS UPSET,

112
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:14,203
CONCERNED ABOUT FALSE STATEMENTS

113
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:17,306
GIVEN BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT

114
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:17,973
AND EXCORIATED THE JUSTICE

115
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:22,211
DEPARTMENT FOR FILING FALSE

116
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:22,945
AFFIDAVITS OF THE HEARING WHERE

117
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:27,449
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S EXPLAIN

118
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,117
WHY IT WASN'T LYING TO THE

119
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:30,386
COURTS IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY

120
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:37,493
BUT EVEN WORSE, THIS STATE

121
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:38,227
DEPARTMENT IS OPPOSING OUR

122
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:38,894
EFFORTS TO BRING HER IN AND

123
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:39,561
QUESTION HER UNDER OATH AND

124
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:42,231
ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

125
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:46,201
ON THE CLINTON EMAIL ISSUE.

126
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,904
>> THEY MOVED TO DISMISS IT IN

127
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:50,205
2014 AND THE JUDGE SAID HE WAS

128
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:50,939
GLAD HE DID NOT DO THAT BECAUSE

129
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,976
NOW HE HAS THIS INFORMATION THAT

130
00:04:53,977 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY LIED AND WITHHELD
