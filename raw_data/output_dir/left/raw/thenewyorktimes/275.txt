1
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,710
Thank you guys
all for coming.

2
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,760
We're part of many
walkouts happening

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,410
across the nation.

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,410
We're going to do 
17 minutes

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,610
for every life
lost in the

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,960
Stoneman shooting.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,770
Then we're going to 
do an extra minute

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,919
for Courtlin, who was
the newest victim

9
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:31,599
of gun violence.

10
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:33,480
We hope that today
will be remembered

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,010
not as a day of
strife and conflict,

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,290
but one of togetherness
and understanding.

13
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,820
It is our time as a generation
to stand up and revamp

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,980
the status quo, to
change the unchangeable

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,920
and advocate for what is right.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,082
We are the true silent majority.

17
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,415
And we will no longer be silent.

18
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:17,890
In the last 1,870 days there
had been 1,624 mass shootings

19
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,980
in the U.S.A. 
America the great, right?

20
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,390
Home of the brave.

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,450
Also home of the AR-15s.

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,580
The children 
were not saved.

23
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,560
President wanting
teachers to be armed.

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Teachers who are 
overworked and underpaid.

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,850
They’re the ones who
are paving our ways.

26
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,600
Now they gotta hold guns?

27
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:38,785
Jan. 30, 2006. Goleta, 
Calif. Seven killed.

28
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:43,390
Oct. 26. Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania. Five killed.

29
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,190
Feb. 12, 2007. Salt Lake City,
Utah. Five killed.

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,880
April 16, 2007.
Blacksburg, Va. 32 killed.

31
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:54,205
Many wounded.

32
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:55,692
If I could please get a 
moment of silence,

33
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:57,352
we're going to read
the 17 names of

34
00:01:57,352 --> 00:01:59,621
the kids who died
in the shooting.

35
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,730
We’re going to start
with Nicholas Dworet,

36
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,000
who was 17 
years old.

37
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,460
Aaron Feis, who
was 37.

38
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,660
Jaime Guttenberg
was only 14.

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,210
Jaime Guttenberg, 14.

40
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:22,315
Chris Hixon.

41
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:25,897
Luke Hoyer.

42
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,630
We are calling on Congress
to ban assault weapons,

43
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,910
to close the loophole
in background checks,

44
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,460
make schools safer and
make sure that we can live

45
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,050
our lives without
the fear of being

46
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,290
taken by a gun
every single day.

47
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,110
Newtown High School, 
if you've had enough

48
00:02:40,110 --> 00:00:00,000
of gun violence, 
use your voice.
