>>> THAT'S A LIVE LOOK AT THE 
U.S. CAPITOL.
OUR COVERAGE OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S FIRST STATE OF THE UNION
STARTS NOW.
>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
NEWS SPECIAL.
JUST ONE YEAR AGO -- 
>> WE WILL LOOK BACK ON TONIGHT 
AS WHEN THIS NEW CHAPTER OF 
AMERICAN GREATNESS BEGAN.
>> Announcer: FOR MANY, IT WAS A
YEAR OF MUCH PROGRESS.
>> I CAME TO WASHINGTON FOR YOU.
YOUR DREAMS ARE MY DREAMS.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS AT NOW 
AN 18-YEAR LOW.
THE BIGGEST TAX CUT OF ALL TIME.
THE STOCK MARKET IS HITTING ONE 
ALL-TIME RECORD AFTER ANOTHER.
THE NEWEST MEMBER OF THE UNITED 
STATES SUPREME COURT.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANY 
PRESIDENT HAS ACCOMPLISHED AS 
MUCH AS THIS PRESIDENT.
>> Announcer: FOR OTHERS, A YEAR
OF DISRUPTION AND A PRESIDENCY 
UNLIKE ANY OTHER.
>> THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO 
COLLUSION.
ROCKET MAN.
WE ARE BUILDING A WALL.
VERY FINE PEOPLE.
ON BOTH SIDES.
HE'S FIRED.
HE'S FIRED.
>> Announcer: NOW, TONIGHT, WHAT
WILL HIS MESSAGE BE TO A DIVIDED
CONGRESS AND POLARIZED AMERICA?
>> FINALLY, WE ARE PUTTING 
AMERICA FIRST.
>> Announcer: LIVE FROM THE 
NATION'S CAPITAL, THE STATE OF 
THE UNION ADDRESS AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE.
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS.
>> Announcer: GOOD EVENING, AND 
WELCOME TO ABC'S LIVE COVERAGE 
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST STATE
OF THE UNION.
WHAT A YEAR IT HAS BEEN.
IT'S BEEN A YEAR OF CONFLICT AND
CONTROVERSY.
BOTH FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE
COUNTRY HE NOW LEADS.
IT'S BEEN EXCITING AND 
EXHAUSTING, UNUSUAL IN SO MANY 
WAYS.
WITH A PRESIDENT UNLIKE ANY 
WE'VE SEEN BEFORE.
TONIGHT, A TURN TO TRADITION.
TRUMP'S CHANCE TO PUT HIS STAMP 
ON THE YEAR PAST AND SET THE 
AGENDA FOR THE YEAR AHEAD IN 
THIS MOST FORMAL SETTING.
AND THAT WAS THE MOMENT, JUST 
MOMENTS AGO WHEN THE FIRST LADY,
MELANIA TRUMP, CAME IN, AS HAS 
BECOME THE TRADITION.
SHE'LL BE SURROUNDED BY THE 
PRESIDENT'S GUESTS TODAY.
AND WE'RE SURROUNDED BY OUR 
POLITICAL TEAM TONIGHT.
I WANT TO GO TO OUR JON KARL IN 
THE CHAMBERS.
AND THE PRESIDENT CLEARLY GOING 
TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP TONIGHT, 
TAKE CREDIT FOR THE STRONG 
ECONOMY AND THE TAX CUT HE 
THINKS IS GOING TO MAKE IT 
STRONGER, BUT HE IS ALSO 
ENTERING THE CHAMBER WITH THE 
LOWEST APPROVAL RATING OF ANY 
MODERN PRESIDENT ONE YEAR IN.
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY THE 
SPEECH IS GOING TO BE BOTH 
OPTIMISTIC AND INCLUSIVE.
THOSE ARE NOT THE FIRST WORDS 
THAT COME TO MIND WHEN YOU THINK
OF TRUMP'S FIRST YEAR.
>> RIGHT.
THE THEME HE HAS TONIGHT IS 
UNITY, BUT HE'S ENTERING A 
CHAMBER THAT IS AS DIVIDED AS 
HAS EVER BEEN.
I WAS HERE DURING THE CLINTON 
IMPEACHMENT AND THIS FEELS EVEN 
MORE DIVIDED THAN IT WAS THEN.
MANY DEMOCRATS HERE IN THIS 
CHAMBER SEE THE PRESIDENT AS NOT
MERELY SOMEBODY THEY DISAGREE 
WITH, BUT SOMEBODY WHO IS A 
DANGER.
AND REPUBLICANS IN THIS CHAMBER 
TALK ABOUT THIS DEEP STATE 
CONSPIRACY WITHIN THE FBI TO 
THWART THIS PRESIDENT.
BUT THE PRESIDENT'S THEME HERE 
WILL BE OPTIMISM.
IN THE TRUMP WORLD VIEW, AMERICA
IS BACK.
STOCK MARKET IS ROARING.
WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF AN 
HISTORIC RALLY THERE.
UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN.
AND THANKS TO HIS TAX CUTS, 
AMERICAN COMPANIES ARE HANDING 
OUT BONUSES.
>> THAT REALLY TURNED THE CORNER
FOR THE PRESIDENT AT THE END OF 
THE YEAR.
MARY BRUCE ALSO IN THE HOUSE 
TONIGHT, OVER IN STATUTORY HALL.
THAT'S THE BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT 
FOR THE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE 
AND SENATE.
THEY GOT THAT SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE, BUT MANY REPUBLICANS 
FEAR THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THIS 
MAJORITY BECAUSE OF THE BACKLASH
AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP.
>> GEORGE, POLLS SHOW THIS 
PRESIDENT IS DEEPLY UNPOPULAR 
AND SO FAR, WE'VE SEEN HIS PARTY
IS PAYING THE POLITICAL PRICE.
THE GOP MAJORITY HERE IS NOW ON 
THE LINE.
AND SO, WHILE THE PRESIDENT 
TONIGHT MAY TRY TO STRIKE MORE 
OF AN OPTIMISTIC TONE, A 
BIPARTISAN TONE AS HE TRIES TO 
STRIKE DEALS ON EVERYTHING FROM 
IMMIGRATION TO INFRASTRUCTURE TO
A SPENDING DEAL, THE REALITY IS,
HE NEEDS DEMOCRATS NOW IN ORDER 
TO GET ANYTHING DONE, IN ORDER 
TO GET HIS AGENDA THROUGH.
BUT GEORGE, DEMOCRATS, THEY ARE 
ALREADY EYEING NOVEMBER AND THEY
HOPE EYEING RETAKING THE 
MAJORITY.
>> AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID 
MANY TIMES, HE NEEDS 60 VOTES TO
GET ANYTHING DONE.
AS YOU SAID, JON KARL, HEALING 
THE DIVIDE GOING TO BE A BIG 
THEME OF THE PRESIDENT.
HERE WITH "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT" 
DAVID MUIR.
WE WERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY
WITH THE PRESIDENT.
HE TALKED ABOUT HEALING THIS 
DIVIDE.
ALSO, IT WAS INTERESTING, 
TOWARDS THE END OF THAT LUNCH, 
HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE LEARNED 
AS PRESIDENT THIS YEAR, LEARNED 
HE HAS TO WORK WITH HEART AND 
SOUL.
DIFFERENT FROM BUSINESS.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
BECAUSE HE CAMPAIGNED ON BEING A
BUSINESSMAN.
BUT HE SAID A LOT OF THE SKILLS 
YOU LEARN AS A BUSINESSMAN, HE'S
BROUGHT TO THE WHITE HOUSE WITH 
HIM.
HE SAID YOU REALLY DO WHAT'S 
BEST FOR PURELY MONETARY REASONS
WHEN YOU'RE A BUSINESSMAN, YOU 
MAKE YOUR MONEY, YOU'RE 
COMPETING AGAINST PEOPLE YOU 
OFTEN DON'T LIKE, YOU WANT TO 
WIN.
BUT HE SAID, IN WHAT IS NORMALLY
AN OFF THE RECORD MOMENT, HE 
SAID, I HAVE LEARNED THAT IT 
TAKES HEART AND COMPASSION TO 
GOVERN.
>> HERE COMES THE 
SERGEANT-AT-ARMS, PAUL IRVING.
HE WILL INTRODUCE THE PRESIDENT.
>> MR. SPEAKER, THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.
>> AND THE PRESIDENT WILL WORK 
HIS WAY DOWN THE AISLE.
MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS LOOKING
FOR THAT GRIP AND GRIN AS HE 
MAKES HIS WAY DOWN.
MATTHEW DOWD, WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT THOSE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
LOOKING FOR A SECOND WITH THE 
PRESIDENT.
YOU GOT ABOUT 20 MINUTES WITH 
THE PRESIDENT TODAY ALONE, WHILE
WE WERE, AFTER WE WERE HAVING 
LUNCH, HE CALLED YOU IN FOR A 
MEETING AND REINFORCED THIS 
THEME HERE THAT WE'VE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT.
>> YEAH, THE WHITE HOUSE REACHED
OUT THIS MORNING AND ASKED IF I 
COULD HAVE A MEETING AT THE OVAL
OFFICE AND IT WAS A ONE-ON-ONE 
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT AND 
I.
AND I EMPHASIZED TO THE 
PRESIDENT, I SAID TO THE 
PRESIDENT, THIS COUNTRY IS AS 
DIVIDED AS IT'S EVER BEEN IN OUR
HISTORY AND HE AS THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES, HE NEEDS 
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
I TOLD HIM, IT'S GOING TO TAKE 
MORE THAN JUST A SPEECH TONIGHT.
HE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF 
THE TEACH.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A SERIES OF 
ACTIONS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS
SPEECH.
HE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND HOWDY 
SLIDED THE COUNTRY IS AND HE 
NEEDS TO STEP UP.
>> AND CECILIA VEGA, ONE OF THE 
ISSUES GOING TO BE FRONT AND 
CENTER TONIGHT, IMMIGRATION.
IT'S DIVIDED DEMOCRATS AND 
REPUBLICANS, DIFFERENT REGIONS 
OF THE COUNTRY.
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEMED TO 
BE OF A DIVIDED MIND ON THIS, AS
WELL.
SOMETIMES TALKING ABOUT 
COMPROMISE, TAKING QUITE A HARD 
LINE ON IMMIGRATION.
>> AND THAT'S BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY
FRUSTRATING FOR THE PEOPLE 
TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL WITH 
HIM.
REMEMBER, CHUCK SCHUMER SAID 
NEGOTIATING WITH DONALD TRUMP 
HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH 
JELL-O.
THE CLOCK IS TICKING ON THIS 
CONGRESS AND THIS PRESIDENT TO 
SAVE THESE DREAMERS, AS MANY 
WOULD SAY.
HE NEEDS THE DEMOCRATS TO DO 
THIS.
WE ARE TOLD THAT IMMIGRATION 
WILL BE A BIG FOCUS TONIGHT.
WE ALSO KNOW THAT AMONG THE MAIN
SPEECHWRITERS WHO HELPED THE 
PRESIDENT ON THIS SPEECH IS 
STEPHEN MILLER, HIS SENIOR 
ADVISER WHO HELPED WRITE THIS 
SPEECH.
YOU KNOW, IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN A
REAL TEST FOR THIS PRESIDENT.
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT, THE ART 
OF THE DEAL PRESIDENT WHO SO FAR
HAS BEEN UNABLE TO REACH A DEAL 
ON IMMIGRATION, HIS BIG SELLING 
POINT, THE WALL, STILL NOT 
FUNDED.
PUSHING FOR THAT DEAL, GEORGE.
>> IT'S BEDEVILLED PRESIDENTS 
BEFORE.
GEORGE W. BUSH COULDN'T GET A 
BIPARTISAN IMMIGRATION DEAL, NOR
COULD BARACK OBAMA.
THE PRESIDENT, BYRON PITTS, 
HOPING THE ECONOMY IS THE GLUE 
THAT HOLDS PEOPLE TOGETHER, AS 
HE WORKS HIS WAY UP TO THE 
PODIUM.
HE TALKED ABOUT LOWEST BLACK 
UNEMPLOYMENT IN YEARS, BUT 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, ON MANY MINDS, 
ALSO THOSE COMMENTS HE MADE 
ABOUT AFRICAN HAITI.
>> PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY 
BELIEVE HE'S AGAINST THEM.
YOU TALK ABOUT THOSE EMPLOYMENT 
NUMBERS, YES, HISTORIC.
LOWEST THEY'VE BEEN FOR 
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BUT CONSIDER 
THIS.
THIS IS THE SLOWEST DROP IN 
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR BLACKS IN FIVE 
YEARS.
AND BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL 
TWICE THAT OF WHITE AMERICA.
SO, HE HAS TO IMPACT THOSE 
NUMBERS BEFORE HE CHANGES MINDS.
>> THE PRESIDENT HANDING HIS 
SPEECH TO THE SPEAKER OF THE 
HOUSE, PAUL RYAN, VICE PRESIDENT
MIKE PENCE.
LOOKS LIKE HE'S READY TO GET TO 
WORK.
MARTHA RADDATZ, WE SAW THE 
PRESIDENT WORK HIS WAY PAST 
SEVERAL GENERALS THERE, 
INCLUDING MANY THAT WORK FOR 
HIM.
>> MANY, MANY GENERALS WORKING 
FOR HIM.
SECRETARY MATTIS, RETIRED 
GENERAL, OF COURSE, H.R. 
McMASTER, AND JOHN KELLY, HIS 
CHIEF OF STAFF.
YOU SAW HIM PASS BY THE JOINT 
CHIEFS.
I OFTEN HAVE PEOPLE ASK ME WHY 
THEY ARE SO SERIOUS AND STERN AT
THESE THINGS, THEY'RE NOT 
SUPPOSED TO CLAP UNLESS IT'S 
ABOUT THE TROOPS.
SO, WE'LL KEEP OUR EYE ON THAT.
>> ONLY CLAP IN SUPPORT -- 
>> NOTHING POLICY OR POLITICS.
>> AND WE REMEMBER WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT HAD THAT INFAMOUS 
CABINET MEETING AND HE WAS 
SURROUNDED BY PRAISE FROM HIS 
FELLOW CABINET MEMBERS, IT WAS 
GENERAL MATTIS.
>> AND THAT'S ALL HE DID.
EVERYONE ELSE SAID SOMETHING 
VERY NICE ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP,
AND GENERAL MATTIS SAID, WE'RE 
PROUD OF OUR TROOPS.
>> DEMOCRATIC LEADER OF THE 
HOUSE, NANCY PELOSI THERE.
NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM THE SPEAKER.
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS.
>> MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, I HAVE 
THE HIGH PRIVILEGE AND THE 
DISTINCT HONOR OF PRESENTING YOU
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES.
>> ANOTHER BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE
AS THE PRESIDENT TAKES THAT IN.
I WANT TO WELCOME IN OUR NEWEST 
ABC CONTRIBUTOR, FORMER GOVERNOR
OF NEW JERSEY, CHRIS CHRISTIE.
ONE THING THE PRESIDENT WON'T 
MENTION TONIGHT, SOMETHING 
THAT'S HUNG OVER HIS HEAD FOR 
MUCH OF THIS LAST YEAR, THE 
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER.
>> NO, HE WON'T, GEORGE.
AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR THE 
COUNTRY AND GOOD FOR THE 
PRESIDENT.
IT AGGRAVATING HIM, IT ANGERS 
HIM AND THAT'S NOT THE PRESIDENT
WE NEED TO SEE TONIGHT.
THE PRESIDENT WE NEED TO SEE 
TONIGHT IS THE ONE WHO SPOKE TO 
US ON ELECTION NIGHT OF 2016.
INSPIRATIONAL AND ASPIRATIONAL.
>> ONE MORE STANDING OVATION FOR
THE PRESIDENT FROM HIS STAFF, 
FROM REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS.
>> MR. SPEAKER, MR. VICE 
PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, 
THE FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED 
STATES AND MY FELLOW AMERICANS, 
LESS THAN ONE YEAR HAS PASSED 
SINCE I FIRST STOOD AT THIS 
PODIUM IN THIS MAJESTIC CHAMBER 
TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TO ADDRESS 
THEIR CONCERNS, THEIR HOPES AND 
THEIR DREAMS.
THAT NIGHT, OUR NEW 
ADMINISTRATION HAD ALREADY TAKEN
VERY SWIFT ACTION.
A NEW TIDE OF OPTIMISM WAS 
ALREADY SWEEPING ACROSS OUR 
LAND.
EACH DAY SINCE, WE HAVE GONE 
FORWARD WITH A CLEAR VISION AND 
A RIGHTEOUS MISSION TO MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN FOR ALL 
AMERICANS.
OVER THE LAST YEAR, WE HAVE MADE
INCREDIBLE PROGRESS AND ACHIEVED
EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS.
WE HAVE FACED CHALLENGES WE 
EXPECTED AND OTHERS WE COULD 
HAVE NEVER IMAGINED.
WE HAVE SHARED IN THE HEIGHTS OF
VICTORY AND THE PAINS OF 
HARDSHIP.
WE HAVE ENDURED FLOODS AND FIRES
AND STORMS.
BUT THROUGH IT ALL, WE HAVE SEEN
THE BEAUTY OF AMERICA'S SOUL AND
THE STEEL IN AMERICA'S SPINE.
EACH TEST HAS FORGED NEW 
AMERICAN HEROES TO REMIND US WHO
WE ARE AND SHOW US WHAT WE CAN 
BE.
WE SAW THE VOLUNTEERS OF THE 
CAJUN NAVY RACING TO THE RESCUE 
WITH THEIR FISHING BOATS TO SAVE
PEOPLE IN THE AFTERMATH OF A 
TOTALLY DEVASTATING HURRICANE.
WE SAW STRANGERS SHIELDING 
STRANGERS FROM A HAIL OF GUNFIRE
ON THE LAS VEGAS STRIP.
WE HEARD TALES OF AMERICANS LIKE
COAST GUARD PETTY OFFICER ASHLEY
LEPERT, WHO IS HERE TONIGHT IN 
THE GALLERY WITH MELANIA.
ASHLEE WAS ABOARD ONE OF THE 
FIRST HELICOPTERS ON THE SCENE 
DURING HURRICANE HARVEY.
THROUGH 18 HOURS OF WIND AND 
RAIN, ASHLEE BRAVED LIVE POWER 
LINES AND DEEP WATER TO HELP 
SAVE MORE THAN 40 LIVES.
ASHLEE, WE ALL THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE HEARD ABOUT AMERICANS LIKE 
FIREFIGHTER DAVID DAHLBERG.
HE'S HERE WITH US ALSO.
DAVID FACED DOWN WALLS OF FLAME 
TO RESCUE ALMOST 60 CHILDREN 
TRAPPED AT A CALIFORNIA SUMMER 
CAMP THREATENED BY THOSE 
DEVASTATING WILDFIRES.
TO EVERYONE STILL RECOVERING IN 
TEXAS, FLORIDA, LOUISIANA, 
PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN 
ISLANDS, EVERYWHERE, WE ARE WITH
YOU, WE LOVE YOU AND WE ALWAYS 
WILL PULL THROUGH TOGETHER, 
ALWAYS.
>> THANK YOU TO DAVID AND THE 
BRAVE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DAVID.
GREAT JOB.
SOME TRIALS OVER THE PAST YEAR 
TOUCHED THIS CHAMBER VERY 
PERSONALLY.
WITH US TONIGHT IS ONE OF THE 
TOUGHEST PEOPLE EVER TO SERVE IN
THIS HOUSE, A GUY WHO TOOK A 
BULLET, ALMOST DIED AND WAS BACK
TO WORK THREE AND A HALF MONTHS 
LATER, THE LEGEND FROM 
LOUISIANA, CONGRESSMAN STEVE 
SCALISE.
>> I THINK THEY LIKE YOU, STEVE.
WE'RE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR 
THE HEROIC EFFORTS OF THE 
CAPITAL POLICE OFFICERS, THEAL 
SAND DREE YA POLICE AND THE 
DOCTORS, NURSES AND PARAMEDICS 
WHO SAVED HIS LIFE AND THE LIVES
OF MANY OTHERS, SOME IN THIS 
ROOM.
AND THE AFTERMATH -- YES.
YES.
AND THE AFTERMATH OF THAT 
TERRIBLE SHOOTING, WE CAME 
TOGETHER, NOT AS REPUBLICANS OR 
DEMOCRATS, BUT AS 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE.
BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO COME 
TOGETHER ONLY IN TIMES OF 
TRAGEDY.
TONIGHT, I CALL UPON ALL OF US 
TO SET ASIDE OUR DIFFERENCES, TO
SEEK OUT COMMON GROUND AND TO 
SUMMON THE UNITY WE NEED TO 
DELIVER FOR THE PEOPLE.
THIS IS REALLY THE KEY.
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WE WERE 
ELECTED TO SERVE.
THANK YOU.
OVER THE LAST YEAR, THE WORLD 
HAS SEEN WHAT WE ALWAYS KNEW, 
THAT NO PEOPLE ON EARTH ARE SO 
FEARLESS OR DARING OR DETERMINED
AS AMERICANS.
IF THERE IS A MOUNTAIN, WE CLIMB
IT.
IF THERE'S A FRONTIER, WE CROSS 
IT.
IF THERE'S A CHALLENGE, WE TAME 
IT.
IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY, WE 
SEIZE IT.
SO, LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT BY 
RECOGNIZING THAT THE STATE OF 
OUR UNION IS STRONG, BECAUSE OUR
PEOPLE ARE STRONG.
AND TOGETHER, WE ARE BUILDING A 
SAFE, STRONG AND PROUD AMERICA.
SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE 
CREATED 2.4 MILLION NEW JOBS, 
INCLUDING -- 
INCLUDING 200,000 NEW JOBS IN 
MANUFACTURING ALONE.
TREMENDOUS NUMBERS.
AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF WAGE 
STAGNATION, WE ARE FINALLY 
SEEING RISING WAGES.
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS HAVE HIT A 
45-YEAR LOW.
AND SOMETHING I'M VERY PROUD OF,
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 
STANDS AT THE LOWEST RATE EVER 
RECORDED.
AND HISPANIC-AMERICAN 
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS ALSO REACHED 
THE LOWEST LEVELS IN HISTORY.
SMALL BUSINESS CONFIDENCE IS AT 
AN ALL-TIME HIGH.
THE STOCK MARKET HAS SMASHED ONE
RECORD AFTER ANOTHER, GAINING $8
TRILLION AND MORE IN VALUE IN 
JUST THIS SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
THE GREAT NEWS -- THE GREAT NEWS
FOR AMERICANS, 401(k) RETIREMENT
PENSION AND COLLEGE SAVINGS 
ACCOUNTS HAVE GONE THROUGH THE 
ROOF AND JUST AS I PROMISED, THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THIS PODIUM
11 MONTHS AGO, WE ENACTED THE 
BIGGEST TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY.
OUR MASSIVE TAX CUTS PROVIDE 
TREMENDOUS RELIEF FOR THE MIDDLE
CLASS AND SMALL BUSINESS.
TO LOWER TAX RATES FOR 
HARD-WORKING AMERICANS.
WE NEARLY DOUBLED THE STANDARD 
DEDUCTION FOR EVERYONE.
NOW, THE FIRST $24,000 EARNED BY
A MARRIED COUPLE IS COMPLETELY 
TAX FREE.
WE ALSO DOUBLED THE CHILD TAX 
CREDIT.
A TYPICAL FAMILY OF FOUR MAKING 
$75,000 WILL SEE THEIR TAX BILL 
REDUCED BY $2,000, SLASHING 
THEIR TAX BILL IN HALF.
IN APRIL, THIS WILL BE THE LAST 
TIME YOU WILL EVER FILE UNDER 
THE OLD AND VERY BROKEN SYSTEM 
AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL 
HAVE MORE TAKE HOME PAY STARTING
NEXT MONTH.
A LOT MORE.
WE ELIMINATED AN ESPECIALLY 
CRUEL TAX THAT FELL MOSTLY ON 
AMERICANS MAKING LESS THAN 
$50,000 A YEAR, FORCING THEM TO 
PAY TREMENDOUS PENALTIES SIMPLY 
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD 
GOVERNMENT-ORDERED HEALTH PLANS.
WE REPEALED THE CORE OF THE 
DISASTROUS OBAMACARE.
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS NOW 
GONE.
THANK HEAVENS.
WE SLASHED THE BUSINESS TAX RATE
FROM 35% ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 
21%, SO AMERICAN COMPANIES CAN 
COMPETE AND WIN AGAINST ANYONE 
ELSE, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
THESE CHANGES ALONE ARE 
ESTIMATED TO INCREASE AVERAGE 
FAMILY INCOME BY MORE THAN 
$4,000.
A LOT OF MONEY.
SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE ALSO 
RECEIVED A MASSIVE TAX CUT AND 
CANNOT DEDUCT 20% OF THEIR 
BUSINESS INCOME.
HERE TONIGHT ARE STEVE STAUB AND
SANDY KEPLINGER OF STAUB 
MANUFACTU
MANUFACTURING, A SMALL, 
BEAUTIFUL BUSINESS IN OHIO.
THEY HAVE JUST FINISHED THE BEST
YEAR IN THEIR 20-YEAR HISTORY.
BECAUSE OF TAX REFORM, THEY ARE 
HANDING OUT RAISES, HIRING AN 
ADDITIONAL 14 PEOPLE AND 
EXPANDING INTO THE BUILDING NEXT
DOOR.
GOOD FEELING.
ONE OF STAUB'S EMPLOYEES, COREY 
ADAMS, IS ALSO WITH US TONIGHT.
COREY IS AN ALL-AMERICAN WORKER.
HE SUPPORTED HIMSELF THROUGH 
HIGH SCHOOL, LOST HIS JOB DURING
THE 2008 RECESSION AND WAS LATER
HIRED BY STAUB, WHERE HE TRAINED
TO BECOME A WELDER.
LIKE MANY HARD-WORKING 
AMERICANS, COREY PLANS TO INVEST
HIS TAX CUT RAISE INTO HIS NEW 
HOME AND HIS TWO DAUGHTERS' 
EDUCATION.
COREY, PLEASE STAND.
AND HE'S A GREAT WELDER.
I WAS TOLD THAT BY THE MAN THAT 
OWNS THAT COMPANY THAT'S DOING 
SO WELL, SO, CONGRATULATIONS, 
COREY.
SINCE WE PASSED TAX CUTS, 
ROUGHLY 3 MILLION WORKERS HAVE 
ALREADY GOTTEN TAX CUT BONUSES.
MANY OF THEM, THOUSANDS AND 
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER WORKER,
AND IT'S GETTING MORE EVERY 
MONTH, EVERY WEEK.
APPLE HAS JUST ANNOUNCED IT 
PLANS TO INVEST A TOTAL OF $350 
BILLION IN AMERICA AND HIRE 
ANOTHER 20,000 WORKERS.
AND JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO, 
EXXON MOBIL ANNOUNCED A $50 
BILLION INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED
STATES.
JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
THIS, IN FACT, IS OUR NEW 
AMERICAN MOMENT.
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A BETTER 
TIME TO START LIVING THE 
AMERICAN DREAM.
SO, TO EVERY CITIZEN WATCHING AT
HOME TONIGHT, NO MATTER WHERE 
YOU'VE BEEN OR WHERE YOU'VE COME
FROM, THIS IS YOUR TIME.
IF YOU WORK HARD, IF YOU BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF, IF YOU BELIEVE IN 
AMERICA, THEN YOU CAN DREAM 
ANYTHING.
YOU CAN BE ANYTHING.
AND TOGETHER, WE CAN ACHIEVE 
ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING.
TONIGHT, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
WHAT KIND OF FUTURE WE'RE GOING 
TO HAVE, AND WHAT KIND OF A 
NATION WE'RE GOING TO BE.
ALL OF US TOGETHER AS ONE TEAM, 
ONE PEOPLE AND ONE AMERICAN 
FAMILY CAN DO ANYTHING.
WE ALL SHARE THE SAME HOME.
THE SAME HEART.
THE SAME DESTINY.
AND THE SAME GREAT AMERICAN 
FLAG.
TOGETHER, WE ARE REDISCOVERING 
THE AMERICAN WAY.
IN AMERICA, WE KNOW THAT FAITH 
AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND 
BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE CENTER OF 
AMERICAN LIFE.
THE MOTTO IS IN GOD WE TRUST.
AND WE CELEBRATE OUR POLICE, OUR
MILITARY AND OUR AMAZING 
VETERANS AS HEROES WHO DESERVE 
OUR TOTAL AND UNWAVERING 
SUPPORT.
HERE TONIGHT IS PRESTON SHARP, A
12-YEAR-OLD BOY FROM READING, 
CALIFORNIA, WHO NOTICED THAT 
VET
VETERANS GRAVES WERE NOT MARKED 
WITH FLAGS ON VETERANS DAY.
HE DECIDED ALL BY HIMSELF TO 
CHANGE THAT, AND STARTED A 
MOVEMENT THAT HAS NOW PLACED 
40,000 FLAGS AT THE GRAVES OF 
OUR GREAT HEROES.
PRESTON, A JOB WELL DONE.
YOUNG PATRIOTS LIKE PRESTON 
TEACH ALL OF US ABOUT OUR CIVIC 
DUTY AS AMERICANS, AND I MET 
PRESTON A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND 
HE IS SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL, 
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.
GREAT FUTURE, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE, 
PRESTON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
PRESTON'S REVERENCE FOR THOSE 
WHO HAVE SERVED OUR NATION 
REMINDS US OF WHY WE SALUTE OUR 
FLAG, WHY WE PUT OUR HANDS ON 
OUR HEARTS FOR THE PLEDGE OF 
ALLEGIANCE AND WHY WE PROUDLY 
STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
AMERICANS LOVE THEIR COUNTRY AND
THEY DESERVE A GOVERNMENT THAT 
SHOWS THEM THE SAME LOVE AND 
LOYALTY IN RETURN.
FOR THE LAST YEAR, WE HAVE 
SOUGHT TO RESTORE THE BONDS OF 
TRUST BETWEEN OUR CITIZENS AND 
THEIR GOVERNMENT.
WORKING WITH THE SENATE, WE ARE 
APPOINTING JUDGES WHO WILL 
INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION AS 
WRITTEN, INCLUDING A GREAT NEW 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE AND MORE 
CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES THAN ANY 
NEW ADMINISTRATION IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
WE ARE TOTALLY DEFENDING OUR 
SECOND AMENDMENT AND HAVE TAKEN 
HISTORIC ACTIONS TO PROTECT 
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
AND WE ARE SERVING OUR BRAVE 
VETERANS, INCLUDING GIVING OUR 
VETERANS CHOICE IN THEIR HEALTH 
CARE DECISIONS.
LAST YEAR, CONGRESS ALSO PASSED,
AND I SIGNED, THE LANDMARK V.A. 
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.
SINCE ITS PASSAGE, MY 
ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY 
REMOVED MORE THAN 1,500 V.A. 
EMPLOYEES WHO FAIL TO GIVE OUR 
VETERANS THE CARE THEY DESERVE, 
AND WE ARE HIRING TALENTED 
PEOPLE WHO LOVE OUR VETS AS MUCH
AS WE DO.
ZB
ZB
AND I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL OUR 
VETS ARE PROPERLY TAKEN CARE OF,
WHICH HAS BEEN MY PROMISE TO 
THEM FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF 
THIS GREAT JOURNEY.
ALL AMERICANS DESERVE 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPECT, AND 
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GIVING TO OUR
WONDERFUL HEROES, OUR VETERANS.
THANK YOU.
SO, TONIGHT, I CALL ON CONGRESS 
TO EMPOWER EVERY CABINET 
SECRETARY WITH THE AUTHORITY TO 
REWARD GOOD WORKERS AND TO 
REMOVE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES WHO 
UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC TRUST OR 
FAIL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
IN OUR DRIVE TO MAKE WASHINGTON 
ACCOU
ACCOUNTABLE, WE HAVE ELIMINATED 
MORE REGULATIONS IN OUR FIRST 
YEAR THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON 
AMERICAN ENERGY AND WE HAVE 
ENDED THE WAR ON BEAUTIFUL CLEAN
COAL.
WE ARE NOW VERY PROUDLY AN 
EXPORTER OF ENERGY TO THE WORLD.
IN DETROIT, I HALTED GOVERNMENT 
MANDATES THAT CRIPPLED AMERICA'S
GREAT, BEAUTIFUL AUTOWORKERS, SO
THAT WE CAN GET MOTOR CITY 
REVVING ITS ENGINES AGAIN, AND 
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
MANY CAR COMPANIES ARE NOW 
BUILDING AND EXPANDING PLANTS IN
THE UNITED STATES, SOMETHING WE 
HAVEN'T SEEN FOR DECADES.
CHRYSLER IS MOVING A MAJOR PLANT
FROM MEXICO TO MICHIGAN.
TOYOTA AND MAZDA ARE OPENING UP 
A PLANT IN ALABAMA, A BIG ONE.
AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS IN A 
LONG TIME.
IT'S ALL COMING BACK.
VERY SOON, AUTO PLANTS AND OTHER
PLANTS WILL BE OPENING UP ALL 
OVER OUR COUNTRY.
THIS IS ALL NEWS AMERICANS ARE 
TOTALLY UNACCUSTOMED TO HEARING.
FOR MANY YEARS, COMPANIES AND 
JOBS WERE ONLY LEAVING US.
BUT NOW, THEY ARE ROARING BACK, 
THEY'RE COMING BACK, THEY WANT 
TO BE WHERE THE ACTION IS, THEY 
WANT TO BE IN THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA.
THAT'S WHERE THEY WANT TO BE.
EXCITING PROGRESS IS HAPPENING 
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
TO SPEED ACCESS TO BREAKTHROUGH 
CURES AND AFFORDABLE GENERIC 
DRUGS, LAST YEAR, THE FDA 
APPROVED MORE NEW AND GENERIC 
DRUGS AND MEDICAL DEVICES THAN 
EVER BEFORE IN OUR COUNTRY'S 
HISTORY.
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT PATIENTS 
WITH TERMINAL CONDITIONS, 
TERMINAL ILLNESS, SHOULD HAVE 
ACCESS TO EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT
IMMEDIATELY, THAT COULD 
POTENTIALLY SAVE THEIR LIVES.
PEOPLE WHO ARE TERMALLY ILL 
SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO FROM 
COUNTRY TO COUNTRY TO SEEK A 
CURE.
I WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE, 
RIGHT HERE AT HOME.
IT'S TIME FOR CONGRESS TO GIVE 
THESE WONDERFUL, INCREDIBLE 
AMERICANS THE RIGHT TO TRY.
ONE OF MY GREATEST PRIORITIES IS
TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.
IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES, THESE 
DRUGS COST FAR LESS THAN WHAT WE
PAY IN THE UNITED STATES AND 
IT'S VERY, VERY UNFAIR.
THAT IS WHY I'VE DIRECTED MY 
ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE FIXING 
THE INJUSTICE OF HIGH DRUG 
PRICES ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES 
FOR THE YEAR.
AND PRICES WILL COME DOWN 
SUBSTANTIALLY, WATCH.
AMERICA HAS ALSO FINALLY TURNED 
THE PAGE ON DECADES OF UNFAIR 
TRADE DEALS THAT SACRIFICED OUR 
PROSPERITY AND SHIPPED AWAY OUR 
COMPANIES, OUR JOBS AND OUR 
WEALTH.
OUR NATION HAS LOST ITS WEALTH, 
BUT WE'RE GETTING IT BACK SO 
FAST.
THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER IS
TOTALLY OVER.
FROM NOW ON, WE EXPECT TRADING 
RELATIONSHIPS TO BE FAIR AND 
VERY IMPORTANTLY, RECIPROCAL.
WE WILL WORK TO FIX BAD TRADE 
DEALS AND NEGOTIATE NEW ONES, 
AND THEY'LL BE GOOD ONES, BUT 
THEY'LL BE FAIR.
AND WE WILL PROTECT AMERICAN 
WORKERS AND AMERICAN 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THROUGH 
STRONG ENFORCEMENT OF OUR TRADE 
RULES.
AS WE REBUILD OUR INDUSTRIES, IT
IS ALSO TIME TO REBUILD OUR 
CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE.
AMERICA IS A NATION OF BUILDERS.
WE BUILT THE EMPIRE STATE 
BUILDING IN JUST ONE YEAR.
ISN'T IT A DISGRACE THAT IT CAN 
NOW TAKE TEN YEARS JUST TO GET A
MINOR PERMIT APPROVED FOR THE 
BUILDING OF A SIMPLE ROAD?
I'M ASKING BOTH PARTIES TO COME 
TOGETHER TO GIVE US SAFE, FAST, 
RELIABLE AND MODERN IN
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT OUR ECONOMY 
NEEDS AND OUR PEOPLE DESERVE.
TONIGHT, I'M CALLING ON CONGRESS
TO PRODUCE A BILL THAT GENERATES
AT LEAST $1.5 TRILLION FOR THE 
NEW INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT 
THAT OUR COUNTRY SO DESPERATELY 
NEEDS.
EVERY FEDERAL DOLLAR SHOULD BE 
LEVERAGED BY PARTNERING WITH 
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND,
WHERE APPROPRIATE, TAPPING INTO 
PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT TO 
PERMANENTLY FIX THE IN
INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIT, AND WE 
CAN DO IT.
ANY BILL MUST ALSO STREAMLINE 
THE PERMITTING AND APPROVAL 
PROCESS.
GETTING IT DOWN TO NO MORE THAN 
TWO YEARS AND PERHAPS EVEN ONE.
TOGETHER, WE CAN RECLAIM OUR 
GREAT BUILDING HERITAGE.
WE WILL BUILD GLEAMING NEW 
ROADS, BRIDGES, HIGHWAYS, 
RAILWAYS AND WATERWAYS, ALL 
ACROSS OUR LAND, AND WE WILL DO 
IT WITH AMERICAN HEART AND 
AMERICAN HANDS AND AMERICAN 
GRIT.
WE WANT EVERY AMERICAN TO KNOW 
THE DIGNITY OF A HARD DAY'S 
WORK.
WE WANT EVERY CHILD TO BE SAFE 
IN THEIR HOME AT NIGHT.
AND WE WANT EVERY CITIZEN TO BE 
PROUD OF THIS LAND THAT WE ALL 
LOVE SO MUCH.
WE CAN LIFT OUR CITIZENS FROM 
WELFARE TO WORK, FROM DEPENDENCE
TO INDEPENDENCE AND FROM POVERTY
TO PROSPERITY.
AS TAX CUTS CREATE NEW JOBS, 
LET'S INVEST IN WORK FORCE 
DEVELOPMENT AND LET'S INVEST IN 
JOB TRAINING, WHICH WE NEED SO 
BADLY.
LET'S OPEN GREAT VOCATIONAL 
SCHOOLS SO OUR FUTURE WORKERS 
CAN LEARN A CRAFT AND REALIZE 
THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.
AND LET'S SUPPORT WORKING 
FAMILIES BY SUPPORTING PAID 
FAMILY LEAVE.
AS AMERICA REGAINS ITS STRENGTH,
OPPORTUNITY MUST BE EXTENDED TO 
ALL CITIZENS.
THAT IS WHY THIS YEAR, WE WILL 
EMBARK ON REFORMING OUR PRISONS 
TO HELP FORMER INMATES WHO HAVE 
SERVED THEIR TIME GET A SECOND 
CHANCE AT LIFE.
STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES, 
ESPECIALLY IMMIGRANT 
COMMUNITIES, WILL ALSO BE HELPED
BY IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT 
FOCUS ON THE BEST INTERESTS OF 
AMERICAN WORKERS AND AMERICAN 
FAMILIES.
FOR DECADES, OPEN BORDERS HAVE 
ALLOWED DRUGS AND GANGS TO POUR 
INTO OUR MOST VULNERABLE 
COMMUNITIES.
THEY'VE ALLOWED MILLIONS OF LOW 
WAGE WORKERS TO COMPETE FOR JOBS
AND WAGES AGAINST THE POOREST 
AMERICANS.
MOST TRAGICALLY, THEY HAVE 
CAUSED THE LOSS OF MANY INNOCENT
LIVES.
HERE TONIGHT ARE TWO FATHERS AND
TWO MOTHERS, EVELYN RODRIGUEZ, 
FREDDY CUEVAS, ELIZABETH 
ALVARADO AND ROBERT MICKENS.
THEIR TWO TEENAGE DAUGHTERS WERE
CLOSE FRIENDS ON LONG ISLAND.
BUT IN SEPTEMBER 2016, ON THE 
EVE OF NISE'S 16th BIRTHDAY, 
SUCH A HAPPY TIME IT SHOULD HAVE
BEEN, NEITHER OF THEM CAME HOME.
THESE TWO PRECIOUS GIRLS WERE 
BRUTALLY MURDERED WHILE WALKING 
TOGETHER IN THEIR HOMETOWN.
SIX MEMBERS OF THE SAVAGE MS-13 
GANG HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH 
KAYLA AND NISE'S MURDERS.
MANY OF THESE GANG MEMBERS TOOK 
ADVANTAGE OF GLARING LOOPHOLES 
IN OUR LAWS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY
AS ILLEGAL, UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN 
MINORS, AND WOUND UP IN KAYLA 
AND NISE'S HIGH SCHOOL.
EVELYN, ELIZABETH, FREDDY AND 
ROBERT, TONIGHT, EVERYONE IN 
THIS CHAMBER IS PRAYING FOR YOU.
EVERYONE IN AMERICA IS GRIEVING 
FOR YOU.
PLEASE STAND.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT 320 
MILLION HEARTS ARE RIGHT NOW 
BREAKING FOR YOU.
WE LOVE YOU.
THANK YOU.
WHILE WE CANNOT IMAGINE THE 
DEPTHS OF THAT KIND OF SORROW, 
WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT OTHER 
FAMILIES NEVER HAVE TO ENDURE 
THIS KIND OF PAIN.
TONIGHT, I AM CALLING ON 
CONGRESS TO FINALLY CLOSE THE 
DEADLY LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE 
ALLOWED MS-13 AND OTHER CRIMINAL
GANGS TO BREAK INTO OUR COUNTRY.
WE HAVE PROPOSED NEW LEGISLATION
THAT WILL FIX OUR IMMIGRATION 
LAWS AND SUPPORT OUR I.C.E. AND 
BORDER PATROL AGENTS.
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.
THESE ARE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE 
THAT WORK SO HARD IN THE MIDST 
OF SUCH DANGER.
SO THAT THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN 
AGAIN.
THE UNITED STATES IS A 
COMPASSIONATE NATION.
WE ARE PROUD THAT WE DO MORE 
THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY ANYWHERE 
IN THE WORLD TO HELP THE NEEDY, 
THE STRUGGLING AND THE 
UNDERPRIVILEGED ALL OVER THE 
WORLD.
BUT AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, MY HIGHEST LOYALTY, MY 
GREATEST COMPASSION, MY CONSTANT
CONCERN, IS FOR AMERICA'S 
CHILDREN, AMERICA'S STRUGGLING 
WORKERS AND AMERICA'S FORGOTTEN 
COMMUNITIES.
I WANT OUR YOUTH TO GROW UP TO 
ACHIEVE GREAT THINGS.
I WANT OUR POOR TO HAVE THEIR 
CHANCE TO RISE.
SO, TONIGHT, I AM EXTENDING AN 
OPEN HAND TO WORK WITH MEMBERS 
OF BOTH PARTIES, DEMOCRATS AND 
REPUBLICANS, TO PROTECT OUR 
CITIZENS OF EVERY BACKGROUND, 
COLOR, RELIGION AND CREED.
MY DUTY, AND THE SACRED DUTY OF 
EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THIS 
CHAMBER, IS TO DEFEND AMERICANS,
TO PROTECT THEIR SAFETY, THEIR 
FAMILIES, THEIR COMMUNITIES AND 
THEIR RIGHT TO THE AMERICAN 
DREAM.
BECAUSE AMERICANS ARE DREAMERS, 
TOO.
HERE TONIGHT IS ONE LEADER IN 
THE EFFORT TO DEFEND OUR 
COUNTRY, HOMELAND SECURITY 
INVESTIGATION SPECIAL AJGENT
CELESTINO MARTINEZ.
15 YEARS IN THE AIR FORCE BEFORE
BECOMING AN I.C.E. AGENT AND 
GETTING DANGEROUS CRIMINALS OFF 
OF OUR STREETS.
TOUGH JOB.
AT ONE POINT, MS-13 LEADERS 
ORDERED C.J.'S MURDER AND THEY 
WANTED IT TO HAPPEN QUICKLY.
BUT HE DID NOT CAVE TO THREATS 
OR TO FEAR.
LAST MAY, HE COMMANDED AN 
OPERATION TO TRACK DOWN GANG 
MEMBERS ON LONG ISLAND.
HIS TEAM HAS ARRESTED NEARLY 
400, INCLUDING MORE THAN 220 
MS-13 GANG MEMBERS.
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHAT THE
BORDER PATROL AND I.C.E. HAVE 
DONE, WE HAVE SENT THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MS-13
HORRIBLE PEOPLE OUT OF THIS 
COUNTRY OR INTO OUR PRISONS.
SO, I JUST WANT TO 
CONGRATULATION YOU, C.J., YOU'RE
A BRAVE GUY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AND I ASKED C.J., WHAT'S THE 
SECRET?
HE SAID, WE'RE JUST TOUGHER THAN
THEY ARE, AND I LIKED THAT 
ANSWER.
NOW, LET'S GET CONGRESS TO SEND 
YOU AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN 
THIS GREAT CHAMBER HAVE TO DO 
IT, WE HAVE NO CHOICE, C.J., 
WE'RE GOING TO SEND YOU 
REINFORCEMENTS AND WE'RE GOING 
TO SEND THEM TO YOU QUICKLY.
IT'S WHAT YOU NEED.
OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, THE 
HOUSE AND SENATE WILL BE VOTING 
ON AN IMMIGRATION REFORM 
PACKAGE.
IN RECENT MONTHS, MY 
ADMINISTRATION HAS MET 
EXTENSIVELY WITH BOTH DEMOCRATS 
AND REPUBLICANS TO CRAFT A 
BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO 
IMMIGRATION REFORM.
BASED ON THESE DISCUSSIONS, WE 
PRESENTED CONGRESS WITH A 
DETAILED PROPOSAL THAT SHOULD BE
SUPPORTED BY BOTH PARTIES AS A 
FAIR COMPROMISE.
ONE WHERE NOBODY GETS EVERYTHING
THEY WANT, BUT WHERE OUR COUNTRY
GETS THE CRITICAL REFORMS IT 
NEEDS AND MUST HAVE.
HERE ARE THE FOUR PILLARS OF OUR
PLAN.
THE FIRST PILLAR OF OUR 
FRAMEWORK GENEROUSLY OFFERS A 
PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR 1.8 
MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO 
WERE BROUGHT HERE BY THEIR 
PARENTS AS A YOUNG AGE.
THAT COVERS ALMOST THREE TIMES 
MORE PEOPLE THAN THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATION COVERED.
UNDER OUR PLAN, THOSE WHO MEET 
EDUCATION AND WORK REQUIREMENTS 
AND SHOW GOOD MORAL CHARACTER 
WILL BE ABLE TO BECOME FULL 
CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES 
OVER A 12-YEAR PERIOD.
THE SECOND PILLAR FULLY SECURES 
THE BORDER.
THAT MEANS BUILDING A GREAT WALL
ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND IT 
MEANS HIRING MORE HEROES LIKE 
C.J. TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES 
SAFE.
CRUCIALLY, OUR PLAN CLOSES THE 
TERRIBLE LOOPHOLES EXPLOITED BY 
CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS TO 
ENTER OUR COUNTRY AND IT FINALLY
ENDS THE HORRIBLE AND DANGEROUS 
PRACTICE OF CATCH AND RELEASE.
THE THIRD PILLAR ENDS THE VISA 
LOTTERY, A PROGRAM THAT RANDOMLY
HANDS OUT GREEN CARDS WITHOUT 
ANY REGARD FOR SKILL, MERIT OR 
THE SAFETY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE.
IT'S TIME TO BEGIN MOVING TOWARD
A MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION 
SYSTEM, ONE THAT ADMITS PEOPLE 
WHO ARE SKILLED, WHO WANT TO 
WORK, WHO WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR
SOCIETY AND WHO WILL LOVE AND 
RESPECT OUR COUNTRY.
THE FOURTH AND FINAL PILLAR 
PROTECTS THE NUCLEAR FAMILY BY 
ENDING CHAIN MIGRATION.
UNDER THE CURRENT BROKEN SYSTEM,
A SINGLE IMMIGRANT CAN BRING IN 
VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF 
DISTANT RELATIVES.
UNDER OUR PLAN, WE FOCUS ON THE 
IMMEDIATE FAMILY BY LIMITING 
SPONSORSHIPS TO SPOUSES AND 
MINOR CHILDREN.
THIS VITAL REFORM IS NECESSARY, 
NOT JUST FOR OUR ECONOMY, BUT 
FOR OUR SECURITY AND FOR THE 
FUTURE OF AMERICA.
IN RECENT WEEKS, TWO TERRORIST 
ATTACKS IN NEW YORK WERE MADE 
POSSIBLE BY THE VISA LOTTERY AND
CHAIN MIGRATION.
IN THE AGE OF TERRORISM, THESE 
PROGRAMS PRESENT RISKS WE CAN 
JUST NO LONGER AFFORD.
IT'S TIME TO REFORM.
IT'S TIME TO REFORM THESE 
OUTDATED IMMIGRATION RULES AND 
FINALLY BRING OUR IMMIGRATION 
SYSTEM INTO THE 21st CENTURY.
THESE FOUR PILLARS REPRESENT A 
DOWN THE MIDDLE COMPROMISE AND 
ONE THAT WILL CREATE A SAFE, 
MODERN AND LAWFUL IMMIGRATION 
SYSTEM.
FOR OVER 30 YEARS, WASHINGTON 
HAS TRIED AND FAILED TO SOLVE 
THIS PROBLEM.
THIS CONGRESS CAN BE THE ONE 
THAT FINALLY MAKES IT HAPPEN.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, THESE FOUR 
PILLARS WILL PRODUCE LEGISLATION
THAT FULFILLS MY IRONCLAD PLEDGE
TO SIGN A BILL THAT PUTS AMERICA
FIRST.
SO, LET'S COME TOGETHER, SET 
POLITICS ASIDE AND FINALLY GET 
THE JOB DONE.
THESE REFORMS WILL ALSO SUPPORT 
OUR RESPONSE TO THE TERRIBLE 
CRISIS OF OPIOID AND DRUG 
ADDICTION.
NEVER BEFORE HAS IT BEEN LIKE IT
IS NOW.
IT IS TERRIBLE.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT 
IT.
IN 2016, WE LOST 64,000 
AMERICANS TO DRUG OVERDOSES.
174 DEATHS PER DAY, SEVEN PER 
HOUR.
WE MUST GET MUCH TOUGHER ON DRUG
DEALERS AND PUSHERS, IF WE ARE 
GOING TO SUCCEED IN STOPPING 
THIS SCOURGE.
MY ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED 
TO FIGHTING THE DRUG EPIDEMIC 
AND HELPING GET TREATMENT FOR 
THOSE IN NEED, FOR THOSE WHO 
HAVE BEEN SO TERRIBLY HURT.
THE STRUGGLE WILL BE LONG AND IT
WILL BE DIFFICULT, BUT AS 
AMERICANS ALWAYS DO, IN THE END,
WE WILL SUCCEED, WE WILL 
PREVAIL.
AS WE HAVE SEEN TONIGHT, THE 
MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES BRING 
OUT THE BEST IN AMERICA.
WE SEE A VIVID EXPRESSION OF 
THIS TRUTH IN THE STORY OF THE 
HOLETS FAMILY OF NEW MEXICO.
RYAN IS 27 YEARS OLD, AN OFFICER
WITH THE ALBUQUERQUE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT.
HE'S HERE TONIGHT WITH HIS WIFE,
REBECCA.
THANK YOU, RYAN.
LAST YEAR, RYAN WAS ON DUTY WHEN
HE SAW A PREGNANT, HOMELESS 
WOMAN PREPARING TO INJECT 
HEROIN.
WHEN RYAN TOLD HER SHE WAS GOING
TO HARM HER UNBORN CHILD, SHE 
BEGAN TO WEEP.
SHE TOLD HIM SHE DIDN'T KNOW 
WHERE TO TURN, BUT BADLY WANTED 
A SAFE HOME FOR HER BABY.
IN THAT MOMENT, RYAN SAID HE 
FELT GOD SPEAK TO HIM.
YOU WILL DO IT, BECAUSE YOU CAN.
HE HEARD THOSE WORDS.
HE TOOK OUT A PICTURE OF HIS 
WIFE AND THEIR FOUR KIDS.
THEN HE WENT HOME TO TELL HIS 
WIFE, REBECCA, IN AN INSTANT, 
SHE AGREED TO ADOPT.
THE HOLETS NAMED THEIR NEW 
DAUGHTER HOPE.
RYAN AND REBECCA, YOU EMBODY THE
GOODNESS OF OUR NATION, THANK 
YOU.
THANK YOU, RYAN AND REBECCA.
AS WE REBUILD AMERICA'S STRENGTH
AND CONFIDENCE AT HOME, WE ARE 
ALSO RESTORING OUR STRENGTH AND 
STANDING ABROAD.
AROUND THE WORLD, WE FACE ROGUE 
REGIMES, TERRORIST GROUPS AND 
RIVALS LIKE CHINA AND RUSSIA 
THAT CHALLENGE OUR INTERESTS, 
OUR ECONOMY AND OUR VALUES.
IN CONFRONTING THESE HORRIBLE 
DANGERS, WE KNOW THAT WEAKNESS 
IS THE SUREST PATH TO CONFLICT, 
AND UNMATCHED POWER IS THE 
SUREST MEANS TO OUR TRUE AND 
GREAT DEFENSE.
FOR THIS REASON, I AM ASKING 
CONGRESS TO END THE DANGEROUS 
DEFENSE SEQUESTER AND FULLY FUND
OUR GREAT MILITARY.
AS PART OF OUR DEFENSE, WE MUST 
MODERNIZE AND REBUILD OUR 
NUCLEAR ARSENAL, HOPEFULLY NEVER
HAVING TO USE IT, BUT MAKING IT 
SO STRONG AND SO POWERFUL THAT 
IT WILL DETER ANY ACTS OF 
AGGRESSION BY ANY OTHER NATION 
OR ANYONE ELSE.
PERHAPS SOME DAY
 IN THE FUTURE, 
THERE WILL BE A MAGICAL MOMENT 
WHEN THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD 
WILL GET TOGETHER TO ELIMINATE 
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE NOT THERE 
YET, SADLY.
LAST Y■EAR, I ALSO PLEDGED THAT 
WE WOULD WORK WITH OUR ALLIES TO
EXTINGUISH ISIS FROM THE FACE OF
THE EARTH.
ONE YEAR LATER, I AM PROUD TO 
REPORT THAT THE COALITION TO 
DEFEAT ISIS HAS LIBERATED VERY 
CLOSE TO 100% OF THE TERRITORY 
JUST RECENTLY HELD BY THESE 
KILLERS IN IRAQ AND IN SYRIA AND
IN OTHER LOCATIONS, AS WELL.
BUT THERE IS MUCH MORE WORK TO 
BE DONE.
WE WILL CONTINUE OUR FIGHT UNTIL
ISIS IS DEFEATED.
ARMY STAFF SERGEANT JUSTIN PECK 
IS HERE TONIGHT.
NEAR RAQQAH LAST NOVEMBER, 
JUSTIN AND HIS COMRADE, CHIEF 
PETTY OFFICER KENTON STACY, WERE
ON A MISSION TO CLEAR BUILDINGS 
THAT ISIS HAD RIGGED WITH 
EXPLOSIVE SO THAT CIVILIANS 
COULD RETURN TO THAT CITY, 
HOPEFULLY SOON, AND HOPEFULLY 
SAFELY.
CLEARING THE SECOND FLOOR OF A 
VITAL HOSPITAL, KENTON STACY WAS
SEVERELY WOUNDED BY AN 
EXPLOSION.
IMMEDIATELY, JUSTIN BOUNDED INTO
THE BOOBY-TRAPPED AND 
UNBELIEVABLY DANGEROUS AND 
UNSAFE BUILDING AND FOUND 
KENTON, BUT IN VERY, VERY BAD 
SHAPE.
HE APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE WOUND
AND INSERTED A TUBE TO REOPEN AN
AIRWAY.
HE THEN PERFORMED CPR FOR 20 
STRAIGHT MINUTES DURING THE 
GROUND TRANSPORT AND MAINTAINED 
ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION THROUGH 
TWO AND A HALF HOURS AND THROUGH
EMERGENCY SURGERY.
KENTON STACY WOULD HAVE DIED IF 
IT WERE NOT FOR JUSTIN'S 
SELFLESS LOVE FOR HIS FELLOW 
WARRIOR.
TONIGHT, KENTON IS RECOVERING IN
TEXAS.
RAQQAH IS LIBERATED.
AND JUSTIN IS WEARING HIS NEW 
BRONZE STAR WITH A HAV"V" FOR 
VALOR.
STAFF SERGEANT PECK, ALL OF 
AMERICA SALUTES YOU.
TERRORISTS WHO DO THINGS LIKE 
PLACE BOMBS IN CIVILIAN 
HOSPITALS ARE EVIL.
WHEN POSSIBLE, WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO ANNIHILATE THEM.
WHEN NECESSARY, WE MUST BE ABLE 
TO DETAIN AND QUESTION THEM.
WE MUST BE CLEAR, TERRORISTS ARE
NOT MERELY CRIMINALS, THEY ARE 
UNLAWFUL ENEMY COMBATANTS.
AND WHEN CAPTURED OVERSEAS, THEY
SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE THE 
TERRORISTS THEY ARE.
IN THE PAST, WE HAVE FOOL ISHLI 
RELEASED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS 
OF DANGEROUS TERRORISTS, ONLY TO
MEET THEM AGAIN ON THE 
BATTLEFIELD, INCLUDING THE ISIS 
LEADER, AL BAGHDADI, WHO WE 
CAPTURED, WHO WE HAD, WHO WE 
RELEASED.
SO, TODAY, I'M KEEPING ANOTHER 
PROMISE.
I JUST SIGNED, PRIOR TO WALKING 
IN, AN ORDER DIRECTING SECRETARY
MATTIS, WHO IS DOING A GREAT 
JOB, THANK YOU.
TO RE-EXAMINE OUR MILITARY 
DETENTION POLICY AND TO KEEP 
OPEN THE DETENTION FACILITIES IN
GUANTANAMO BAY.
I AM ASKING CONGRESS TO ENSURE 
THAT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS 
AND AL QAEDA WE CONTINUE TO HAVE
ALL NECESSARY POWER TO DETAIN 
TERRORISTS WHEREVER WE CHASE 
THEM DOWN, WHEREVER WE FIND 
THEM.
AND IN MANY CASES, FOR THEM, IT 
WILL NOW BE GUANTANAMO BAY.
AT THE SAME TIME, AS OF A FEW 
MONTHS AGO, OUR WARRIORS IN 
AFGHANISTAN HAVE NEW RULES OF 
ENGAGEMENT.
ALONG WITH THEIR HEROIC AFGHAN 
PARTNERS, OUR MILITARY IS NO 
LONGER UNDERMINED BY ARTIFICIAL 
TIMELINES AND WE KNOW LONGER 
TELL OUR ENEMIES OUR PLANS.
LAST MONTH, I ALSO TOOK AN 
ACTION ENDORSED UNANIMOUSLY BY 
THE U.S. SENATE, JUST MONTHS 
BEFORE, I RECOGNIZED JERUSALEM 
AS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, DOZENS OF 
COUNTRIES VOTED IN THE UNITED 
NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY AGAINST
AMERICA'S SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO 
MAKE THIS DECISION.
IN 2016, AMERICAN TAXPAYERS 
GENEROUSLY SENT THOSE SAME 
COUNTRIES MORE THAN $20 BILLION 
IN AID.
THAT IS WHY TONIGHT, I AM ASKING
CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION TO 
HELP ENSURE AMERICAN FOREIGN 
ASSISTANCE DOLLARS ALWAYS SERVE 
AMERICAN INTERESTS AND ONLY GO 
TO FRIENDS OF AMERICA, NOT 
ENEMIES OF AMERICA.
AS WE STRENGTHEN FRIENDSHIPS ALL
AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE ALSO 
RESTORING CLARITY ABOUT OURE 
ADVERSAR
ADVERSARIES.
WHEN THE PEOPLE OF IRAN ROSE UP 
AGAINST THE CRIMES OF THEIR 
CORRUPT DICTATORSHIP, I DID NOT 
STAY SILENT.
AMERICA STANDS WITH THE PEOPLE 
OF IRAN IN THEIR COURAGEOUS 
STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM.
I AM ASKING CONGRESS TO ADDRESS 
THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS IN THE 
TERRIBLE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALWAYS 
IMPOSED TOUGH SANCTIONS ON THE 
COMMUNIST AND SOCIALISTIC 
DICTATORSHIPS IN CUBA AND 
VENEZUELA.
BUT NO REGIME HAS 0 POPPRESSED  
OWN CITIZENS MORE TOTALLY THAN 
THE CRUEL DICTATORSHIP IN NORTH 
KOREA.
NORTH KOREA'S RECKLESS PURSUIT 
OF NUCLEAR MISSILES COULD VERY 
SOON THREATEN OUR HOMELAND.
WE ARE WAGING A CAMPAIGN OF 
MAXIMUM PRESSURE TO PREVENT THAT
FROM EVER HAPPENING.
PAST EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT US 
THAT COMPLACENCY AND CONCESSIONS
ONLY INVITE AGGRESSION AND 
PROVOCATION.
I WILL NOT REPEAT THE MISTAKES 
OF PAST ADMINISTRATIONS THAT GOT
US INTO THIS VERY DANGEROUS 
POSITION.
WE NEED ONLY LOOK AT THE 
DEPRAVED CHARACTER OF THE NORTH 
KOREAN REGIME TO UNDERSTAND THE 
NATURE OF THE NUCLEAR THREAT IT 
COULD POSE TO AMERICA AND TO OUR
ALLIES.
OTTO WARMBIER WAS A HARD-WORKING
STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
VIRGINIA AND A GREAT STUDENT HE 
WAS.
ON HIS WAY TO STUDY ABROAD IN 
ASIA, OTTO JOINED A TOUR TO 
NORTH KOREA.
AT ITS CONCLUSION, THIS 
WONDERFUL YOUNG MAN WAS ARRESTED
AND CHARGED WITH CRIMES AGAINST 
THE STATE.
AFTER A SHAMEFUL TRIAL, THE 
DICTATORSHIP SENTENCED OTTO TO 
15 YEARS OF HARD LABOR, BEFORE 
RETURNING HIM TO AMERICA LAST 
JUNE HORRIBLY INJURED AND ON THE
VERGE OF DEATH.
HE PASSED AWAY JUST DAYS AFTER 
HIS RETURN.
OTTO'S WONDERFUL PARENTS, FRED 
AND CINDY, ARE HERE WITH US 
TONIGHT, ALONG WITH OTTO'S 
BROTHER AND SISTER, AUSTIN AND 
GRETA.
PLEASE.
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.
YOU ARE POWERFUL WITNESSES TO A 
MENACE THAT THREATENS OUR WORLD 
AND YOUR STRENGTH TRULY INSPIRES
US ALL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
TONIGHT, WE PLEDGE TO HONOR 
OTTO'S MEMORY WITH TOTAL 
AMERICAN RESOLVE.
THANK YOU.
FINALLY -- WE ARE JOINED BY ONE 
MORE WITNESS TO THE OMINOUS 
NATURE OF THIS REGIME.
HIS NAME IS JI-SEONG-HO.
HE WAS A STARVING BOY IN NORTH 
KOREA.
ONE DAY, HE TRIED TO STEAL COAL 
FROM A RAILROAD CAR TO BARTER 
FOR A FEW SCRAPS OF FOOD, WHICH 
WERE VERY HARD TO GET.
IN THE PROCESS, HE PASSED OUT ON
THE TRAIN TRACKS, EXHAUSTED FROM
HUNGER.
HE WOKE UP AS A TRAIN RAN OVER 
HIS LIMBS.
HE THEN ENDURED MULTIPLE 
AMPUTATIONS WITHOUT ANYTHING TO 
DULL THE PAIN OR THE HURT.
HIS BROTHER AND SISTER GAVE WHAT
LITTLE FOOD THEY HAD TO HELP HIM
RECOVER, AND ATE DIRT 
THEMSELVES, PERMANENTLY STUNTING
THEIR OWN GROWTH.
LATER, HE WAS TORTURED BY NORTH 
KOREAN AUTHORITIES AFTER 
RETURNING FROM A BRIEF VISIT TO 
CHINA.
HIS TORMENTERS WANTED TO KNOW IF
HE'D MET ANY CHRISTIANS.
HE HAD, AND HE RESOLVED AFTER 
THAT TO BE FREE.
HE TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES 
ON CRUTCHES ALL ACROSS CHINA AND
SOUTHEAST ASIA TO FREEDOM.
MOST OF HIS FAMILY FOLLOWED, HIS
FATHER WAS CAUGHT TRYING TO 
ESCAPE AND WAS TORTURED TO 
DEATH.
TODAY, HE LIVES IN SEOUL, WHERE 
HE RESCUES OTHER DEFECTORS AND 
BROADCASTS INTO NORTH KOREA WHAT
THE REGIME FEARS MOST.
THE TRUTH.
TODAY, HE HAS A NEW LEG, BUT I 
UNDERSTAND YOU STILL KEEP THOSE 
OLD CRUTCHES AS A REMINDER OF 
HOW FAR YOU'VE COME.
YOUR GREAT SACRIFICE IS AN 
INSPIRATION TO US ALL.
PLEASE.
THANK YOU.
HIS STORY IS A TESTAMENT TO THE 
YEARNING OF EVERY HUMAN SOUL TO 
LIVE IN FREEDOM.
IT WAS THAT SAME YEARNING FOR 
FREEDOM THAT NEARLY 250 YEARS 
AGO GAVE BIRTH TO A SPECIAL 
PLACE CALLED AMERICA.
IT WAS A SMALL CLUSTER OF 
COLONIES CAUGHT BETWEEN A GREAT 
OCEAN AND A VAST WILDERNESS.
IT WAS HOME TO AN INCREDIBLE 
PEOPLE WITH A REVOLUTIONARY 
IDEA, THAT THEY COULD RULE 
THEMSELVES.
THAT THEY COULD CHART THEIR OWN 
DESTINY.
AND THAT TOGETHER THEY COULD 
LIGHT UP THE ENTIRE WORLD.
THAT IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT.
THAT IS WHAT AMERICANS HAVE 
ALWAYS STOOD FOR, ALWAYS STRIVED
FOR AND ALWAYS DONE.
ATOP THE DOME OF THIS CAPITOL 
STANDS THE STATUE OF FREEDOM.
SHE STANDS TALL AND NIFIED 
AMONG THE MONUMENTS TO OUR 
ANCESTORS WHO FOUGHT AND LIVED 
AND DIED TO PROTECT HER.
MONUMENTS TO WASHINGTON AND 
JEFFERSON AND LINCOLN AND KING.
MEMORIALS TO THE HEROES OF 
YORKTOWN AND SARATOGA.
YOUNG AMERICANS WHO SHED THEIR 
BLOOD ON THE SHORES OF NORMANDY.
AND THE FIELDS BEYOND.
AND OTHERS WHO WENT DOWN IN THE 
WATERS OF THE PACIFIC AND THE 
SKIES ALL OVER ASIA.
AND FREEDOM STANDS TALL OVER ONE
MORE MONUMENT, THIS ONE, THIS 
CAP
CAPITOL, THIS LIVING MONUMENT, 
THIS IS THE MONUMENT TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WE'RE A PEOPLE WHOSE HEROES LIVE
NOT ONLY IN THE PAST, BUT ALL 
AROUND US, DEFENDING HOPE, PRIDE
AND DEFENDING THE AMERICAN WAY.
THEY WORK IN EVERY TRADE, THEY 
SACRIFICE TO RAISE A FAMILY, 
THEY CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN AT 
HOME, THEY DEFEND OUR FLAG 
ABROAD AND THEY ARE STRONG MOMS 
AND BRAVE KIDS.
THEY ARE FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE
OFFICERS AND BORDER AGENTS, 
MEDICS AND MARINES, BUT ABOVE 
ALL ELSE, THEY ARE AMERICANS.
AND THIS CAPITOL, THIS CITY, 
THIS NATION, BELONGS ENTIRELY TO
THEM.
OUR TASK IS TO RESPECT THEM.
TO LISTEN TO THEM, TO SERVE 
THEM, TO PROTECT THEM.
AND TO ALWAYS BE WORTHY OF THEM.
AMERICANS FILL THE WORLD WITH 
ART AND MUSIC.
THEY PUSH THE BOUNDS OF SCIENCE 
AND DISCOVERY, AND THEY FOREVER 
REMIND US OF WHAT WE SHOULD 
NEVER, EVER FORGET.
THE PEOPLE DREAMED THIS COUNTRY.
THE PEOPLE BUILT THIS COUNTRY.
AND IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
AS LONG AS WE ARE PROUD OF WHO 
WE ARE AND WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING 
FOR, THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT 
ACHIEVE.
AS LONG AS WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN
OUR VALUES.
FAITH IN OUR CITIZENS.
AND TRUST IN OUR GOD.
WE WILL NEVER FAIL.
OUR FAMILIES WILL THRIVE.
OUR PEOPLE WILL PROSPER.
AND OUR NATION WILL FOREVER BE 
SAFE AND STRONG AND PROUD AND 
MIGHTY AND FREE.
THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.
GOOD NIGHT.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WRAPPING UP 
HIS FIRST STATE OF THE UNION.
IT WAS A LONG ONE.
AND HOUR AND 20 MINUTES.
NOT THE LONGEST EVER, BILL 
CLINTON HAS THAT RECORD.
PRESIDENT REPEATING SOME OF HIS 
SIGNATURE LINES, SAYING THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE MAKING 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
SAYS THE ERA OF ECONOMIC 
SURRENDER IS OVER.
SAYS HE WANTS AN IMGRMIGRATION 
POLICY THAT PUTS AMERICA FIRST.
CAME INTO THIS CHAMBER TODAY 
PROMISING TO TRY TO HEAL THE 
DIVIDES OF AMERICA, BRING 
AMERICA TOGETHER.
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IN THE 
COMING DAYS WHAT AMERICA THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT.
FIRST, WANT TO GO INSIDE THE 
CHAMBER, AS THE PRESIDENT WORKS 
HIS WAY BACK, TO JON KARL WHO 
WAS THERE FOR IT ALL.
ONE THING IS PRETTY CLEAR, JON.
HE DID NOT UNIFY THAT CHAMBER 
TONIGHT.
>> GEORGE, I'VE NEVER SEEN 
ANYTHING LIKE IT.
RIGHT NOW, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 
BASICALLY RUN FOR THE EXITS.
I MEAN, USUALLY WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT LEAVES, YOU STILL HAVE
MEMBERS APPLAUDING.
HE DID NOT UNIFY THIS CHAMBER, 
PARTICULARLY ON THE ISSUE OF 
IMMIGRATION.
NOT A SINGLE DEMOCRATIC APPLAUSE
ON HIS IMMIGRATION PROPOSAL.
>> YEAH, AND MARY BRUCE, OUR 
SENIOR CONGESRESSIONAL 
CORRESPONDENT, THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE THE BIG COMPROMISE, THAT'S
NOT WHAT DEMOCRAT HEARD AND YOU 
COULD HEAR THE AUDIBLE GROANS 
WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE 
PILLARS IN THE IMMIGRATION PLAN.
>> EXACTLY.
A FAIR COMPROMISE IS HOW THE 
PRESIDENT MAY BE DESCRIBING THE 
PLAN THAT HE'S OUTLINED, BUT 
THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT HOW 
DEMOCRATS SEE IT.
AND MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
OWN PARTY HAVE OBJECTIONS TO 
THIS DEAL.
LOOK, THIS IS THE MOST PRESSING 
ISSUE FACING CONGRESS RIGHT NOW 
AND IT TOOK THE PRESIDENT ABOUT 
45 MINUTES TO ADDRESS IT.
THERE IS AN URGENT LOOMING 
DEADLINE HERE AND REPUBLICANS 
AND DEMOCRATS ARE NO CLOSER TO 
SOLVING THIS AND, GEORGE, YOU 
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THOSE DOZENS
OF DREAMERS IN THE AUDIENCE 
TONIGHT.
WHAT THEY ARE THINKING, AS THEY 
HEAR THE PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT 
THIS, AS THEY SEE THE DIVISIONS 
THERE ON THE FLOOR, CONCERNED 
THAT THEY COULD FACE DEPORTATION
COME THE BEGINNING OF MARCH.
AND WHAT THE DREAMERS WERE 
THINKING WHEN THEY HEARD THE 
PRESIDENT SAY THAT LINE THAT 
WILL LIKELY BE ONE OF THE MOST 
MEMORABLE MOMENTS, WHEN HE SAID 
AMERICANS ARE DREAMERS, TOO.
>> SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT CECILIA VEGA, WE 
HEARD THAT LINE, WE HEARD A LOT 
ABOUT THE DANGERS OF UNENFORCED 
BORDERS, ECHOES OF HIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT SPEECH BACK IN JUNE
OF 2015.
>> EXACTLY.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE SAID, 
THOUGH, GEORGE IS THAT HE WANTS 
TO SET-- HAVE THE COUNTRY SET AE
THE DIFFERENCES AND WENT ON TO 
TALK ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED 
IMMIGRANTS AS MS-13 GANG 
MEMBERS, DEMONIZING THEM.
HE'S GOING TO HAVE A TOUGH SELL 
WHEN HE'S TRYING TO SELL UNITY.
AGAIN, SORT OF STOKING, I THINK 
MANY WOULD SAY, RACIAL TENSIONS 
BY BRINGING UP THE ISSUE OUT OF 
KNEELING AT THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
PEOPLE WILL SEE THIS AS CLEAR 
AND CONCISE FROM THIS PRESIDENT.
>> AND MEGHAN McCAIN, FROM "THE 
VIEW" ALSO JOINING US TONIGHT, 
DID THE PRESIDENT -- DID YOU 
HEAR ANY AVENUES OF BIPARTISAN 
COMPROMISE TONIGHT OR WAS THIS 
MORE THE PRESIDENT WHO IS 
DECIDING TO STICK WITH HIS BASE?
>> IT WAS ACTUALLY SURPRISINGLY 
NOT AS BIPARTISAN AS I 
ANTICIPATED.
AS CECILIA TALKED ABOUT 
KNEELING, OR STANDING FOR THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM, HIS COMMITMENT 
TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT, ENFA 
SIZING IN GOD WE TRUST, THOSE 
ARE THINGS THAT WILL CERTAINLY 
MAKE HIS BASE HAPPY, BUT NOT 
NECESSARILY SOMETHING I 
ANTICIPATED IN THIS KIND OF 
STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH.
LIKE I SAID, IT WAS A LOT MORE 
DIVISIVE THAN I ANTICIPATED, BUT
I'M SURE CONSERVATIVES WILL BE 
HAPPY TONIGHT.
>> MATTHEW DOWD, DID THE 
PRESIDENT DELIVER WHAT HE TALKED
TO YOU ABOUT EARLIER TODAY?
>> WHAT I WAS THINKING AS I WAS 
LISTENING TO THE SPEECH, IS THAT
THE PRESIDENT MET WITH ME AFTER 
THE SPEECH, I WOULD SAY TO HIM, 
WELL, THAT WAS HOW NOT TO GIVE A
UNIFYING SPEECH.
SO, LET'S GOING BACK AND GIVE A 
UNIFYING SPEECH.
CALLING THIS A HEALING SPEECH IS
ALMOST LIKE CALLING, GOING ON A 
DIET BY DRINKING A DIET COKE AND
EATING A PIZZA.
THAT'S AS MUCH OF A HEALING 
SPEECH THIS WAS.
>> DAVID, THE PRESIDENT SOUNDED 
LIKE HE MEANT IT WHEN HE SAID 
IT.
>> HE REALLY DID, AND, YOU KNOW,
TO MEGHAN McCAIN'S POINT, IT 
WILL MAKE CONSERVATIVES HAPPY, I
WAS THINKING ABOUT THE VOTERS WE
TALKED TO IN PENNSYLVANIA, 
MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, IN 
PARTICULAR TO DISTRICTS WHERE IT
WAS LESS THAN 1%, THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY
CLINTON, AND THEN WHEN WE WERE 
AT THAT LUNCH TODAY AT THE WHITE
HOUSE, AND I ASKED HIM, WHAT 
WILL HE SAY TO THE PEOPLE WHO 
ARE STILL NOT CONVINCED HE 
HASN'T BROUGHT ANYMORE PEOPLE 
INTO THE FRAY IN MANY OF THE 
PLACES WE TALKED TO THEM, AND HE
SAID, I WOULD CONSIDER IT A 
GREAT ACHIEVEMENT IF WE COULD 
MAKE OUR COUNTRY UNITED.
THAT'S WHAT WE TOLD US TODAY, IF
I COULD UNITE THIS COUNTRY.
AS YOU CAN SEE IN THAT CHAMBER 
TONIGHT, DEMOCRATS RARELY 
STANDING, AND CERTAINLY NOT ON 
ANY OF THE POLICY PROPOSALS.
NOT EVEN ON INFRASTRUCTURE, 
GEORGE, WHICH IS SOMETHING THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE TALKED LONG 
ABOUT, AS WELL. 
>> MARTHA RADDATZ, HE DID TRY TO
GET BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR 
SUPPORTING THE TROOPS.
>> THAT'S AN EASY ONE, FOR 
SUPPORTING THE TROOPS.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET APPLAUSE FOR
THAT.
IT WAS JUST A PARTICULARLY 
GLOOMY SPEECH.
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T MENTION THE 
WORD CARNAGE, BUT HE TALKED A 
LOT ABOUT CARNAGE.
IT WAS A SAD SPEECH THERE AT THE
END AND DID NOT UNIFY, EXACTLY 
WHAT EVERYBODY IS SAYING ABOUT 
NOT UNIFYING THE DEMOCRATS.
THEY RESPECT PEOPLE IN THE 
COUNTRY WHO PROBABLY FEEL HOW 
THEY DO.
>> CHRIS CHRISTIE, ARE WE 
MISSING SOMETHING HERE?
>> IT WAS A TRADITIONAL STATE OF
THE UNION SPEECH.
I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO LONG, BUT 
IN THE END, GEORGE, I WOULD 
DISAGREE WITH MARTHA AND SOME OF
THE OTHERS ON THIS, THE 
DEMOCRATS WERE NOT STANDING FOR 
ANYTHING.
NOTHING.
EVEN THE THINGS THAT EVERYBODY 
CAN BE UNIFIED ON.
THEY DIDN'T STAND ON.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, 
THEY'RE IN 2018 MIDTERM ELECTION
WAR FOOTING.
NOW, THE PRESIDENT MAYBE COULD 
HAVE DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, 
SHORTENED IT, GOT A BIGGER AND 
MORE UNIFYING THEME, BUT IN THE 
END, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD 
HAVE EVEN STOOD UP THEN.
THAT WAS A PRETTY GLUM LOOKING 
GROUP OF DEMOCRATS ALL THROUGH 
THE EVENING.
>> COKIE ROBERTS, WAS THAT A 
MISTAKE FOR THE DEMOCRATS?
>> WELL, THEY PROBABLY SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN SOME WHAT MORE 
ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN THE PRESIDENT 
CAME IN.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THEM NOT 
CLAPPING FOR A PRESIDENT WHO 
ENTERS THE CHAMBER, BUT HE DID 
DO A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT 
CLEARLY DID MAKE THEM ANGRY, 
AND, YOU KNOW, TALKING ABOUT THE
NAT
NATIONAL -- STANDING FOR THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM, THERE WERE MANY
ME
MEMBERS THERE WEARING AFRICAN 
CLOTH.
THE PRESIDENT NEVER MENTIONED 
AFRICA, NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE
THAT, SO, THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING
THERE FOR THEM TO RELATE TO.
>> PRESIDENT HAS LEFT THE 
CHAMBER.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK.
WHEN WE COME BACK, THE 
DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE WITH 
CONGRESSMAN JOE FSEPH KENNEDY.
>> Announcer: NEXT, HE'S THE 
GRANDSON OF LIBERAL ICON BOBBY 
KENNEDY AND THE GRAND NEPHEW OF 
SENATOR TED KENNEDY.
37-YEAR-OLD CONGRESSMAN FROM 
MASSACHUSETTS, JOE KENNEDY III.
HOW WILL HE RESPOND?
ABC NEWS LIVE COVERAGE OF THE 
STATE OF THE UNION AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE WILL 
CONTINUE IN A MOMENT.
>>> AND WE ARE BACK.
ABOUT TO GET THE DEMOCRATIC 
RESPONSE FROM CONGRESSMAN JOE 
KENNEDY FROM FALL RIVER, 
MASSACHUSETTS.
A THIRD GENERATION OF KENNEDYS.
I WANT TO BRING IN STEPHANIE 
CUTTER, WHO HAS WORKED CLOSELY 
WITH THE KENNEDY FAMILY.
A GRANDSON OF BOBBY KENNEDY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
CONGRESSMAN KENNEDY HAS A STRONG
REPUTATION OF BEING A WORKHORSE.
NOW A SHOW BOAT, WHICH, AS YOU 
KNOW, IS UNUSUAL IN CONGRESS.
HE'S VERY POPULAR AT HOME IN 
MASSACHUSETTS.
AND I THINK WHAT WE'LL SEE 
TONIGHT IS UNLIKE WHAT WAS 
BILLED FOR THE PRESIDENT'S 
SPEECH, THIS WILL BE A REAL 
UNIFYING SPEECH.
THAT'S WHAT -- THAT'S WHERE HIS 
PASSION IS, IN BRINGING PEOPLE 
TOGETHER.
HE'S SOLUTION-ORIENTED.
THAT'S HIS REPUTATION IN 
MASSACHUSETTS.
AND I THINK WE'LL SEE IT.
>> HE WILL BE SPEAKING BEFORE A 
SMALL CROWD IN FALL RIVER, 
MASSACHUSETTS.
CONGRESSMAN JOE KENNEDY, COMING 
UP RIGHT NOW.
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN.
IT IS AN ABSOLUTE PRIVILEGE TO 
JOIN YOU ALL TONIGHT.
WE ARE HERE IN FALL RIVER, 
MASSACHUSETTS, A PROUD AMERICAN 
CITY.
AN AMERICAN CITY BUILT BY 
IMMIGRANTS.
FROM TECH TILES TO ROBOTS, THIS 
IS A PLACE THAT KNOWS HOW TO 
MAKE GREAT THINGS.
THE STUDENTS THAT ARE WITH US 
HERE THIS EVENING IN THE AUTO 
TECH PROGRAM CARRY ON THAT RICH 
LEGACY.
LIKE MANY AMERICAN HOMETOWNS, 
FALL RIVER HAS FACED ITS SHARE 
OF STORMS.
BUT THE PEOPLE HERE ARE TOUGH.
THEY FIGHT FOR EACH OTHER, THEY 
PULL FOR THEIR CITY.
IT IS A FITTING PLACE TO GATHER,
AS OUR NATION REFLECTS ON THE 
STATE OF OUR UNION.
THIS IS A DIFFICULT TASK.
AND MANY HAVE SPENT THE LAST 
YEAR ANXIOUS, ANGRY, AFRAID.
WE ALL FEEL THE FRACTURED FAULT 
LINES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY.
WE HEAR THE VOICES OF AMERICANS 
WHO ARE FORGOTTEN AND FEEL 
FORSAKEN.
WE SEE AN ECONOMY THAT MAKES 
STOCKS SOAR, INVESTOR PORTFOLIOS
BULGE AND CORPORATE PROFITS 
CLIMB, BUT FAILS TO GIVE WORKERS
THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THE REWARD.
A GOVERNMENT THAT STRUGGLES TO 
KEEP ITSELF OPEN.
RUSSIA KNEE-DEEP IN OUR 
DEMOCRACY.
AN ALL-OUT WAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION.
A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ROLLING 
BACK CIVIL RIGHTS BY THE DAY.
HATRED AND SUPREMACY PROUDLY 
MARCHING IN OUR STREETS.
BULLETS TEARING THROUGH OUR 
CLAS
CLASSROOMS, CONCERTS AND 
CONGREGATIONS.
TARGETING OUR SAFEST SACRED 
PLACES.
AND THIS NAGGING, SINKING 
FEELING, NO MATTER YOUR 
POLITICAL BELIEFS, THAT THIS IS 
NOT RIGHT.
THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.
FOLKS, IT WOULD BE EASY TO 
DISMISS THIS PAST YEAR AS CHAOS,
PARTISANSHIP, POLITICS.
BUT IT'S FAR, FAR BIGGER THAN 
THAT.
THIS ADMINISTRATION ISN'T JUST 
TARGETING THE LAWS THAT PROTECT 
US, THEY'RE TARGETING THE VERY 
IDEA THAT WE ARE ALL WORTHY OF 
PROTECTION.
FOR THEM, DIGNITY ISN'T 
SOMETHING YOU'RE BORN WITH, BUT 
SOMETHING YOU MEASURE.
BY YOUR NET WORTH, YOUR 
CELEBRITY, YOUR HEADLINES, YOUR 
CROWD SIZE.
NOT TO MENTION THE GENDER OF 
YOUR SPOUSE, THE COUNTRY OF YOUR
BIRTH, THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN.
THE GOD OF YOUR PRAYERS.
THEIR RECORD IS A REBUKE TO OUR 
HIGHEST AMERICAN EYE DEEM, THE 
BELIEF THAT WE ARE ALL WORTHY, 
THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL, THAT WE 
ALL COUNT, IN THE EYES OF OUR 
LAW AND OUR LEADERS, OUR GOD AND
OUR GOVERNMENT.
THAT IS THE AMERICAN PROMISE.
BUT TODAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
TODAY THAT PROMISE IS BEING 
BROKEN.
BY AN ADMINISTRATION THAT 
CALLUSLY APPRAISES OUR WO
WORTHINESS AND DECIDES WHO MAKES
THE CUT AND WHO CAN BE BARGAINED
AWAY.
THEY ARE TURNING AMERICAN LIFE 
INTO A ZERO SUM GAME WHERE FOR 
ONE TO WIN, ANOTHER MUST LOSE.
WHERE WE CAN GUARANTEE AMERICA'S
SAFETY IF WE SLASH OUR SAFETY 
NET.
WHERE WE CAN EXTEND HEALTH CARE 
IN MISSISSIPPI IF WE GUT IT IN 
MASSACHUSETTS.
WE CAN CUT TAXES FOR 
CORPORATIONS TODAY IF WE RAISE 
THEM ON FAMILIES TOMORROW.
WHERE WE CAN TAKE CARE OF SICK 
KIDS IF WE SACRIFICE DREAMERS.
WE ARE BOMBARDED WITH ONE FALSE 
CHOICE AFTER ANOTHER.
COAL MINERS OR SINGLE MOMS.
RURAL COMMUNITIES OR INNER 
CITIES.
THE COAST OR THE HEARTLAND.
AS IF THE MECHANIC IN 
PITTSBURGH, A TEACHER IN TULSA 
AND A DAY CARE WORKER IN 
BIRMINGHAM ARE BITTER RIVALS 
RATHER THAN MUTUAL CASUALTIES OF
A SYSTEM FORCEFULLY RIGGED 
TOWARDS THOSE AT THE TOP.
AS IF THE PARENT WHO LIES AWAKE,
TERRIFIED THAT THEIR TRANSGENDER
SON OR DAUGHTER WILL BE BEATEN 
AND BULLIED AT SCHOOL IS ANYMORE
OR LESS LEGITIMATE THAN A PARENT
WHOSE HEART IS SHATTERED BY A 
DAUGHTER IN THE GRIPS OF AN 
OPIOID ADDICTION.
SO, HERE IS THE ANSWER THAT 
DEMOCRATS OFFER TONIGHT.
WE CHOOSE BOTH.
WE FIGHT FOR BOTH.
BECAUSE THE GREATEST, STRONGEST,
RICHEST NATION IN THE WORLD 
SHOULD NOT HAVE TO LEAVE ANYONE 
BEHIND.
WE CHOOSE A BETTER DEAL FOR ALL 
WHO CALL OUR COUNTRY HOME.
WE CHOOSE A LIVING WAGE AND PAID
LEAVE AND AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE 
YOUR FAMILY NEEDS TO SURVIVE.
PENSIONS THAT ARE SOLVENT, TRADE
PACTS THAT ARE FAIR, ROADS AND 
BRIDGES THAT WON'T RUST AWAY, A 
GOOD EDUCATION THAT YOU CAN 
AFFORD.
WE CHOOSE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
THAT OFFERS YOU MERCY, WHETHER 
YOU SUFFER FROM CANCER OR 
DEPRESSION OR ADDICTION.
WE CHOOSE AN ECONOMY STRONG 
ENOUGH TO BOAST RECORD STOCK 
PRICES AND BRAVE ENOUGH TO ADMIT
THAT TOP CEOs MAKING 300 TIMES 
THEIR AVERAGE WORKER IS NOT 
RIGHT.
WE CHOOSE FALL RIVER.
WE CHOOSE THE THOUSANDS OF 
AMERICAN COMMUNITIES WHOSE ROADS
AREN'T PAVED WITH POWER OR 
PRIVILEGE, BUT WITH HONEST 
EFFORT, WITH GOOD FAITH AND THE 
RESOLVE TO BUILD SOMETHING 
BETTER FOR YOUR KIDS.
THAT -- THAT IS OUR STORY.
IT BEGAN THE DAY OUR FOUNDING 
FATHERS AND MOTHERS SET SAIL FOR
A NEW WORLD, FLEEING OPPRESSION 
AND INTOLERANCE.
IT CONTINUED WITH EVERY WORD OF 
OUR INDEPENDENCE, THE AUDACITY 
TO DECLARE THAT ALL MEN ARE 
CREATED EQUAL.
AND IMPERFECT PROMISE FOR A 
NATION STRUGGLING TO BECOME A 
MORE PERFECT UNION.
IT GREW WITH EVERY FREEDOM 
RIDER'S VOICE AND WITH EVERY 
WEARY SOUL WE WELCOMED TO OUR 
SHORES, AND TO ALL THE DREAMERS 
OUT THERE WATCHING TONIGHT, LET 
ME BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR -- YOU 
ARE PART OF OUR STORY.
WE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.
AND WE WILL NOT WALK AWAY.
AMERICA, WE CARRY THAT STORY ON 
OUR SHOULDERS.
YOU SWARMED WASHINGTON LAST YEAR
TO ENSURE THAT NO PARENT HAS TO 
WORRY IF THEY CAN AFFORD TO SAVE
THEIR CHILD'S LIFE.
YOU PROUDLY MARCHED TOGETHER 
LAST WEEKEND, THOUSANDS DEEP, ON
THE STREETS OF LAS VEGAS AND 
PHILADELPHIA AND NASHVILLE.
YOU SAT HIGH ATOP YOUR MOM'S 
SHOULDERS AND HELD A SIGN THAT 
READ "BUILD A WALL AND MY 
GENERATION WILL TEAR IT DOWN."
YOU BRAVELY SAY "ME TOO."
YOU STEADFASTLY SAY "BLACK LIVES
MATTER."
YOU WADE THROUGH FLOODWATERS, 
BATTLE HURRICANES, BRAVE 
WILDFIRES AND MUDSLIDES, TO SAVE
A STRANGER.
YOU BATTLE YOUR OWN QUIET 
BATTLES EVERY SINGLE DAY.
YOU DRAG YOUR WEARY BODIES TO 
THAT EXTRA SHIFT SO THAT YOUR 
FAMILIES WON'T FEEL THE STING OF
SCARCITY.
YOU LEAVE LOVED ONES AT HOME TO 
DEFEND OUR COUNTRY OVERSEAS, 
PATROL OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AT 
NIGHT.
YOU SERVE.
YOU RESCUE.
YOU HELP.
YOU HEAL.
THAT, MORE THAN ANY LAW OR 
LEADER, DEBATE OR DISAGREEMENT, 
THAT IS WHAT DRIVES US TOWARDS 
PROGRESS.
BULLIES MAY LAND A PUNCH, THEY 
MAY LEAVE A MARK, BUT THEY HAVE 
NEVER, NOT ONCE IN THE HISTORY 
OF OUR UNITED STATES, MANAGED TO
MATCH THE STRENGTH AND SPIRIT OF
A PEOPLE UNITED IN DEFENSE OF 
THEIR FUTURE.
POLI
POLITICIANS -- 
POLIT
POLITICIANS CAN BE CHEERED FOR 
THE PROMISES THEY MAKE.
OUR COUNTRY WILL BE JUDGED BY 
THE PROMISES WE KEEP.
THAT IS THE MEASURE OF OUR 
CHARACTER.
THAT IS WHO WE ARE.
OUT OF MANY, ONE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HAVE 
FAITH.
HAVE FAITH.
THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS 
HOPEFUL, RESILIENT AND ENDURING.
GOD BLESS YOU.
GOD BLESS YOUR FAMILIES.
AND MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA.
THANK YOU.
>> CONGRESSMAN JOE KENNEDY, THE 
DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE.
WE'LL
