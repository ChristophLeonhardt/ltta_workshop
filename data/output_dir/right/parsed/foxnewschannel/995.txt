BEFORE WE CAN CALL THE TIGHT
DEMOCRATIC RACE FOR GOVERNOR.
DANA?
>> Sandra: THANKS, JONATHAN.
FOR MORE, I'M JOINED BY CHRIS
STIREWALT AND EDITOR OF HALF
TIME REPORT.
CHRIS, WHILE JONATHAN WAS
TALKING, SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER
CAME TO THE PODIUM.
THEY HAD THE POLICY LUNCH, THE
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
SEPARATELY.
WHEN CHUCK SCHUMER CAME OUT, HE
TALKED ABOUT NORTH KOREA AND
THEN HE IMMEDIATELY PIVOTED TO
HEALTHCARE.
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT
HOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE
APPROACHING THESE MID-TERMS?
>> THERE'S BEEN DISAGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES, BETWEEN
BRANCHES OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
AND WHAT THE APPROPRIATE AND
MOST USEFUL FOCUS FOR DEMOCRATS
IS IN 2018.
CHUCK SCHUMER IS NOT AMBIGUOUS
ON THE QUESTION.
HE BELIEVES AND IS SUPPORTING
WITH A LOT OF POLLING DATA THAT
HEALTHCARE WORKS FOR DEMOCRATS.
WHO HAD BEEN A NEGATIVE FOR THEM
UNDER OBAMA NOW IN THE REGIME OF
SORT OF HOBBLED OBAMACARE WITH
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAVING
GUTTED MUCH OF OBAMACARE, BUT
STILL LEFT THE CONSTRUCT THERE,
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A REAL
OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH REPUBLICANS
ON HEALTH INSURANCE, ON
HEALTHCARE AND SCHUMER WANTS TO
DISCIPLINE HIS PARTY THAT THEY
FOCUS ON THAT.
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WORKS.
>> Sandra: MIGHT BE BE ONE OF
THE ONLY ISSUES.
I WANT TO ASK YOU WHAT JONATHAN
HUNT WAS TALKING ABOUT.
YOU HAVE THIS RACE IN NEVADA AND
ALSO IN NORTH DAKOTA.
YOU HAVE A RACE SETTLED.
THAT WILL BE A BIG ONE AS WELL.
>> NORTH DAKOTA, WE'RE WAITING
FOR THE MAIN EVENT.
WE HAVE TWO -- BECAUSE IT'S A
SPARSELY POPULATED STATE, NORTH
DAKOTA'S CONGRESSMAN, KEVIN
CRAMER IS ELECTED AT LARGE.
THIS IS A RARE CIRCUMSTANCE
WHERE YOU'LL HAVE SOMEBODY
RUNNING FOR SENATE WHO HAS
ALREADY BEEN ELECTED BY THE
VOTERS.
HEIDI HEITKAMP, A FRESHMAN THAT
WON THE FAVOR OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP.
SHE'S A DEMOCRAT BUT HE
OBVIOUSLY LIKES HER.
SHARING THE HAND, TELLS HER
SHE'S DOING A GOOD JOB.
SHE'S BEEN SYMPATHETIC TO HIM.
THIS IS FRUSTRATING FOR CRAMER
THAT WANTS A MORE CLEAR RED
VERSUS BLUE LINE HERE BUT TRUMP
HAS MUDDIED IT FOR HIM.
>> Sandra: TELL ME ABOUT
VIRGINIA.
THEY VOTED IN 2017 IN THE
GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION.
THE DEMOCRATS HAD TREMENDOUS
TURNOUT.
CAN THEY PULL THAT OFF AGAIN IN
2018?
WILL YOU HAVE ANY INDICATION OF
THAT TONIGHT?
>> WE'LL SEE SOME SIGNS.
IN VIRGINIA, YOU HAVE TWO OR
THREE HOUSE RACES WHERE IT'S
COMPETITIVE IN VIRGINIA.
THE SENATE RACE IS NOT
COMPETITIVE.
THEY DON'T HAVE A GUBERNATORIAL
CONTEST THIS YEAR.
SO WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT
THE HOUSE DISTRICTS.
HOW DO THE DEMOCRATS SORT
THEMSELVES OUT AND REMEMBER PART
OF THE SECRET NOR DEMOCRATS IN
VIRGINIA, THEIR GREAT
PERFORMANCE WAS THE FACT THAT
LIBERAL VOTERS LINED UP BEHIND
MODERATES LIKE GOVERNOR RALPH
NORTHUN.
WILL WE VERY DIVISION,
AGREEMENT?
IT'S NOT JUST HOW ROBUST THEY
ARE.
IT'S HOW MUCH IN AGREEMENT THEY
ARE.
>> Sandra: FINALLY, TAKE ME TO
SOUTH CAROLINA.
WE'RE WATCHING A COUPLE RACES
THERE.
REPRESENTATIVE MARK SANFORD, THE
INCUMBENT, TRYING TO BEAT BACK
HIS PRIMARY CHALLENGE ON THE
REPUBLICAN SIDE.
REPUBLICAN HENRY McMASTER HOPING
TO GET TRUMP SUPPORT.
>> IF McMASTER IS NOT FINE, THAT
WOULD BE A SHOCKER.
HE IS THE SOUL OF THE STATE'S
POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT THAT
PREDATES NIKKI HALEY, THE
REVOLUTION THAT SHE BROUGHT TO
THE STATE.
HE'S OF THE OLD GUARD, BUT HE
ALSO HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE
PRESIDENT.
HE OUGHT TO BE FINE.
SANFORD IS IN A DIFFICULT SPOT.
HE'S CARVED OUT A GOOD SECOND
CAREER FOR HIMSELF AS A
CONGRESSMAN.
A ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVE, DO A GOOD
JOB KIND OF CONGRESSMAN, LOW
PROFILE AFTER THE SCANDAL AND
ALL THAT STUFF.
NOW HE FACES AN OPPONENT THAT IS
TOTALLY WILLING TO GO THERE.
SHE'S WILLING TO GO AFTER HIM ON
HIS SCANDAL, SHE'S WILLING TO
CALL HIM OUT FOR THE TIMES THAT
HE'S BEEN CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP AND SHE'S HOPING THAT IN
THAT DISTRICT TRUMP AFFINITY
WILL SORT OF GO BEYOND THE
ATTACHMENT THAT THESE VOTERS
HAVE FOR A CONGRESSMAN THAT
SERVED HIM WELL.
>> Sandra: ARE YOU GOING TO STAY
UP LATE?
>> HECK YEAH.
SHANNON BREAM AND I WILL BE
