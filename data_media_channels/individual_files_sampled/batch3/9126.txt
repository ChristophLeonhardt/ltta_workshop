Tucker: THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS 26 DAYS. AS WE MOVE CLOSER TO ELECTION DAY, WE LOOK AT PARTICULAR RACES AND THE CANDIDATES RUNNING IN THEM. TONIGHT WE WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT KEER CITIZEN CINEMA RUNNING TO TAKE JEFF FLAKE'S SEAT IN ARIZONA. IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN A LONG ISSUE FOR THEM. CINEMA IS TRYING TO PORTRAY HERSELF AS A MODERATE, SOME ONE WHO SUPPORTS AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS AND ROBUST BORDER SECURITY. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE SHE IS NOT A MODERATE. IN 2006SINEMA DECLARED THAT ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO DIE SNEAKING INTO THE COUNTRY ARE EQUIVALENT TO AMERICANS DIEING IN THE IRAQ WAR. TO SAY IMMIGRATION IS NOT A WAR OR EQUAL IN MAGNITUDE TO WARY BELIEVE DISHONORS THOSE WHO DIED IN THE COUNTRY AND OTHERS ASKING MY GRANTS. THE DEATHS THAT PEOPLE SUFFER IN THE MEXICO ARIZONA DESERT ARE THE SAME AS THE DEATHS THAT PEOPLE SUFFER IN THE IRAQ DESERT. THEY ARE NEEDLESS, SENSELESS DEATHS. THAT'S NOT A MAINSTREAM POSITION EVEN NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REVOLUTION WE'RE GOING THROUGH. THREE YEARS AFTER SHE SAID THAT, SIMENEMA DESCRIBED IT THIS WAY, I OPPOSE ALL IMMIGRATION LAWS F YOU THINK THAT FOREIGNERS BREAKING YOUR COUNTRY'S LAWS ARE EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE CITIZENS DIEING TO DEFEND THEM, IT'S POSSIBLE YOU MAY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR OWN PEOPLE, YOUR OWN COUNTRYMEN, THE CITIZENS OF YOUR NATION. SINEMA SEEMS TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM, HERE SHE IS IN 2011. PEOPLE GO INTO ARIZONA AND SAY THEY'RE SUPER CRAZY. IT IS SOMETHING IN THE WATER? THE WATER IS FINE, IT'S FROM COLORADO. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE WATER. THEY JUST, THEY'RE CALLED REPUBLICANS. Tucker: CHARLIE HERD IS THE OPINION EDITOR AT WASHINGTON TIMES, VERY SMART MAN, JOINS US TONIGHT. CHARLIE, THINGS HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH THAT THIS IS NOT DISQUALIFYING SAYING THAT THE DEATHS OF ILLEGAL ALIENS IN THE DESERT, TRYING TO BREAK OUR LAWS, ARE MORALLY EQUIVALENT TO THE SOL JESS FIGHTING IN IRAQ. THREE YEARS AGO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER. DOES THIS HURT HER, DO YOU THINK? I CERTAINLY HOPE IT DOES. YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT. WHAT WE'VE SEEN, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT THIS, WHAT THE TEA PARTY HAS DONE TO THE REPUBLIC CAN PARTY. I THINK THERE WAS HEALTHY STUFF, FORCING REPUBLICANS TO GET BACK TO SOME OF THEIR PRINCIPLES. BUT MY GOODNESS, WHAT WE'RE SEEING HAPPEN TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, ONCE LEGITIMATE PARTY THAT WE RELIED ON TO KEEP THE REPUBLICANS HONEST, OR THE SUPPOSEDLY CONSERVATIVE PARTY HONEST. AND TO CHALLENGE THEM. THEY'RE GETTING DRAGGED SO FAR OUT OF THE LEFT OFF THE CLIFF, THAT I DON'T KNOW, THAT CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HURT HER IN A DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER. I DO THINK THAT IT MIGHT HURT HER IN A EMELECTION. I MEAN, A LOT OF WHAT SHE SAID THERE, IT'S KIND OF HARD NOT TO CONCLUDE THAT SHE HATES AMERICA F YOU HATE OR BORDERS AND YOU HATE OUR LAWS ENFORCING OUR BORDERS, THEN YOU KIND OF BY DEFINITION HATE AMERICA. AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CAMPAIGN SHE'S RUNNING ON. AND THEN ESPECIALLY, IF YOU THINK ABOUT, RUNNING AGAINST SOMEBODY LIKE MARTHA McSALLY, AT THE LEAST SERVED HER COUNTRY. Tucker: CAREER MILITARY OFFICER. MADE A JOKE OF THE FACT THAT SINEMA BRAG ABOUT HAVING 100 PAIR OF SHOES, AND McCALLY BRAGS ABOUT 100 COMBAT MISSES. WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THE FOREIGN WARS OR NOT, AND I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM, I THINK THAT YOU TO COMPARE THE SACRIFICES THAT OUR MEN AND WOMEN MADE FOLLOWING THE ORDERS OF THE MILITARY, TO ILLEGALS CROSSING THE BORDER, AND TIE-DYEING TRYING TO BREAK OUR LAWS AND GET INTO THE COUNTRY, IS ASTONISHING.
