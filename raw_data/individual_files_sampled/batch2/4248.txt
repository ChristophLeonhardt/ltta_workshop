the news that Trump's most pivotal White House lawyer the man literally at the white-hot center of the Russia probe as well as at the center of the warnings about Mike Flynn as well as at the center the efforts to oust Jeff Sessions and rod Rosen Stein and even Bob Miller himself that man White House Counsel Don McGann is out that is the news tonight Axios first reported it today that he has plans to exit in the fall and then Donald Trump rush to get on top of that scoop tweeting them again is leaving so we can also report tonight something about that tweet that is somewhat typical of this White House sources saying McGann didn't even know Donald Trump was announcing his exit that way now McGann has a job that is high power but honestly low visibility in fact it was in one of his very rare public interviews at CPAC when he explained how he was directly appointed by Trump and how much he gets to touch in this post the counsels of the President is a appointed position directly answerable to the president it is not a career spot I I am appointed by President Trump it is the primary legal adviser to the president and that involves you and just about everything unfortunately yes unfortunately yes a little candor there about not wanting to do all the legal everything in this White House and there is something here that actually is a point of rare agreement from Trump allies and critics alike in the crime riddled Trump world everyone knows McGann is critical in fact today the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee was basically begging for him to stay on others have noted how McGann could hurt Trump because he was so close to so many potentially criminal acts under investigation to be honest with you this is something that I've noticed there have been a lot of stories that have broken over the past week or two that cast White House Counsel Don McGann as the superhero who is saving the Republic this is another one of those stories where Don McGann White House Counsel is the only man standing between America and the abyss today's news comes after Trump's week from Lee heÂ´ll which featured not only the convictions of his top lawyer and former campaign chief but also remember after that provocative New York Times report detailing how the White House was blindsided over just how much Magan had told miller's investigators and up to 30 hours of certainly interesting interviews muller looking at what Magan knew as the first top White House official briefed on Michael Flynn's crime which he confessed to of lying to the FBI as well as Trump's pressure on Magan over getting Jeff Sessions to either take over the Russia probe or potentially leave the administration plus there were of course the clashes with James Comey and other acts that could be obstruction or even ignite an existential crisis for Trump's presidency because when you take it all together it was McGann who Trump was pushing to do his dirty work and try to fire Muller McGann reportedly refused that's the leak Rachel was just referring to an act of alleged bureaucratic heroism that found its way to the newspapers and if the story is good enough for them you can bet it's good enough to tell Bob Muller so how does the president feel today about McGann telling Muller about the president's private efforts to fire Muller it's quite a question well today Donald Trump claims he's not concerned about it while another former Trump lawyer John Dowd insist Trump doesn't actually need to face him alert at all do you believe the president will eventually sit down with Bob Muller based on your experience with him wanting to engage with counsel well there's no baby there's no reason for the president to answer questions from Muller Mahler has all the answers we gave him all the answers now we do know Bob Miller disagrees with what you just heard there because he is pressing for the interview the White House Counsel though isn't always a job that defines legitimacy or the future of a presidency particularly when the presidency is healthy the White House Counsel doesn't tend to be a household name but when the counsel is testifying against the president amidst an independent prosecutor probe like John Dean they're on the Left or defending actions and other officials identified as say illegal surveillance or unconstitutional torture like Alberto Gonzalez or spending days with Bob Muller to offer most private details of the president's state of mind amidst potential obstruction like Don Magan there on the right well then yes the actions and the departure of that White House Council can have a bearing on the making or unmaking of a presidency with that in mind we turn to an excellent panel tonight Miley a former counsel to another chief executive the mayor of New York City and an MSNBC legal analyst for us David from a former speechwriter for George W Bush who did serve in that same administration is Gonzalez and also an author of Trumbo Christiana of the Atlantic and former federal prosecutor Joyce Vance quite a panel for quite a day at the White House Maya your view of the significance of mr. McGann's departure a man who Rachel and I and others have noted seems like quite the hero if you believe his own leaks so it is news certainly I don't think that we're gonna see any major shifts and how this investigation is going to be handled through the White House because of course McGann has not been the primary lawyer handling the Russian investigation for the White House so that it's there we're not gonna see a major shift in strategy I apologize in posture I think what we have to understand is McGann was actually part of the mission-critical team what I mean by that is he made it his job to accomplish Trump's mission but let me push you on the posture there is a view here that Trump wants to get Muller fire the New York Times reported it McGann was reported as the obstacle Donald Trump hasn't necessary change his mind about that the the interpretation here would be that McGann who was the barrier for that has been removed what about that deal at the look here's the point the president is the president and nobody can stop him from making a decision to remove someone he wants to remove so just because a counsel says don't do it doesn't mean he has to listen he should listen because having a lawyer is like having a doctor you don't want a doctor telling you oh you don't want to know you have brain cancer okay I'll tell you you don't have brain cancer even though you do you want a lawyer to say I'm gonna tell you what you don't want to hear it would be a bad decision I'm going to tell you I may make a decision to leave if you make that bad decision that's basically what we know about the interaction between Donald Trump and Don Magan so I actually think Don Magan has been on the outs for a long time in the White House I suspect this is more to the extent the timing is happening now about the fact that obviously Donald Trump could not have been too happy about Magan talking to Muller in the way he's reading and reading the details that he provided so let me go to David from Maya refers to a doctor treating a cancer it was another white house counsel John Dean who talked about a cancer on the presidency your view of where Dawn McGann fits into some of these famous counsels well there are two broad types of people who tend to end up in the White House Counsel job one type of person like Lloyd Cutler under Jimmy Carter are lawyers who have earned enormous reputations before entering the White House where bought and brought in by presidents knowing that this person is the prestige and the strength and the independence to be able to say no to the president and if the president doesn't like what he's hearing the council will walk out the door and go back to his big job in Wall Street or K Street in Washington the other broad type of counsel are those like John Dean as he was in nineteen in the Nixon administration who are people come with really almost no previous national reputation I mean the president can rely on not to doesn't the President or we will say no whom the president can count on to say yes as white House Counsel John Dean to his later costs did say yes dawn McGann is basically a John Dean entered as a John Dean and is hoping to become a Lloyd Cutler by strategically leaking along the way and the question we are all going to discover is which of those identities is the more true to what really happened it's fascinating when you put it like that I think you're in agreement with my colleague Rachel Maddow's analysis as well let's take a list of that for Joyce Don Magan all of a sudden is the subject of a lot of news stories in terms of him having restrained the president from his worst or potentially most unconstitutional impulses around the Russia investigation and obstruction of justice makes Don began like the picture of her self-sacrifice here right joy Cyr take it's interesting to see the president go through lawyer is faster than a chain-smoker goes through cigarettes I mean Magana is just leaving the this steady drumbeat of lawyers departing but this one re you're right because there's been so much publicity surrounding it and it's cut both ways on the one hand there's this effort to cast him again in a good light the person who's gone and been the bright line between Trump and some serious misdeeds on the other hand there's been this story that he's parted ways with the president the story that he spoke with Bob Muller for over 30 hours implying that the president didn't know what he talked about but that it would have been issues close to the presidency but one thing that we all know is that McGann has been central to the president's success in getting federal judges and firms I would not be too quick to take that leap of faith that says that McGann is on the outs with the president we have seen reports though that he's been hesitant on the issue of giving Paul Manafort a pardon it's possible that much as the president was perceived by many to be signaling to manna fort last week that a pardon was a possibility when he spoke of manna fort favorably perhaps he's saying McGann is leaving a pardon is again being dangled in a direction that the President may feel some pressure with the coming september trial for manna for well you're nailing that as you so often do because that was the other context David there were these leaks as Joyce refers to that basically if this was a reside we talked about fireable offenses this may have been a quote resign herbal offense in the sense that McGann has drawn a red line over certain things and Donald Trump's response reportedly was great then you can go and I'll get someone who will carry out a part in order well look all through the Trump administration that we are calling what used to be down now up so obviously it's better not to issue brazenly self-serving pardons than to issue brazenly self-serving pardons you know it was only in the last administration and all the administration's dating going back before that going back to Watergate that the idea that the president would use the pardon power in his own interest at was completely alien I mean from Watergate until the end of the Obama administration the what the pardons were run not by the president but by the Department of Justice that would do an elaborate system of vetting recommendations the president will and his staff would of course make the final decisions but it was not a personal prerogative of the presidency in the way that it has become and the fact that Don McGann has said look don't horribly abuse this personal power of the presidency in such an obvious way doesn't mean that it's still not something you resign over when the president on the very first day says we're not doing this through the Department of Justice this is my prerogative I'm using it my way Joyce I think that that's a good analysis of the situation no president has ever tried to use the pardon for his own benefit and here Trump is perhaps using it defensively trying to keep damaging information about himself or his family from coming to light so it's unprecedented in many ways it would make sense that McGann trying to protect the presidency because he is after all his White House Counsel the Presidency's lawyer and not the president's lawyer that he would be trying to preserve those time-honored sort of practices and ensuring that the future of the presidency was not led down a different path by the conduct of this president and I would I would offer one amendment which is I think a fair reading of the history is that other presidents have certainly been criticized for struggling to use the pardon power in a in a uniform or non self-interested way bush in the administration you serve David was was criticized for using the commutation power so that scooter libby didn't face the same accountability that almost any other defendant would face bill clinton in pardoning mark rich in an unusual way when he was still a fugitive and was seen as linked to the Clintons and then obviously bush senior pursuant to Ron contra I think one difference though that is so much more severe in degree which does reinforce the points you both made and my I'll leave with you briefly is the notion that those were all debatable Prudential decisions that people said was too close but the notion of family or self pardons has never been on the table before it's never been on the table before and I'm not going to give Don McGee the credit that he just got I actually think if you're being the lawyer that McGann has always been which is a on Trump mission and an aggressive lawyer for Donald Trump remember he was his campaign lawyer and he was very aggressive with the FEC this is a guy who if he is doing his job which I think he did in this instance is say don't do it because it's actually gonna beef up the case against right just not for any good really trying to protect the history of how pardons are use well there is a saying that if don McGann were freestyling he wouldn't need a hype man because he does so much hyping for himself that's something that has been said in legal circles in Washington hey I'm
