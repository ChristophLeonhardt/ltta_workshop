day yesterday and and most of the day today is Roy Moore the very controversial Alabama Senate Republican nominee he is he was hit with a series of allegations by The Washington Post 30 sources have talked to the Washington Post about Roy Moore's alleged history of Oh news in his early 30s trying to go out with women who are anywhere from 14 to 18 years old the most serious allegation is brought by one particular woman who was 14 years old named Blake Hoffman and she alleged his sexual assault by Roy Moore when he was 32 and she was 14 the allegations themselves are sickening there are some people today who are trying to make light of the allegations by saying well you know he's 32 and she's 16 or 17 is that such a big deal I am 33 years old okay I'm exactly the age that Roy Moore was when Roy Moore was apparently doing this stuff the idea of even going anywhere near a high school freshman is so perverse and sickening and anyone who ever tried to do that to my sister or my daughter I would be very tempted to grab my shotgun from my safe drive them to a remote spot and take them out really if someone were molesting if my 14 year old sister that would be the proper solution now the question is whether these allegations are true or not but here's what the Washington Post says and we owe it to the people who have spoken on the record by name to at least take the allegation seriously and the reason I say that is there's this tendency on some people part of some people but on both the right and the left to basically let things go when it's when it's your side right so Teddy Kennedy drives a car off a bridge there's a woman in the back she dies but Teddy Kennedy he's really an important politician he's part of the Kennedy family so we let it go Bill Clinton he can molest the help doesn't matter so long as Bill Clinton is for abortion naina Burrell a of Time magazine says that she would perform oral sex on him as long as he keeps abortion legal right we see this with Donald Trump in the last election cycle all these allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment hit and a lot of people say well you know lesser of two evils you still got a vote for him or at least we still we at least have to voice support for him now I'm not going to equate voting for a candidate with necessarily supporting everything that the candidate is does it has done in the past because there is more to it than that but there is a moral question here as to whether you are allowed to either vote or support a candidate who does these sorts of things and this is something that I had serious problems with during the election cycle the lesser of two evils mentality particularly in politics will lead to the worsening of all of our politicians because basically it allows you to get away with anything my Teddy Kennedy can murder someone and that's totally fine so long as Teddy Kennedy votes the right way Bill Clinton came unless the help totally fine so long as you votes the way the right way Donald Trump will be the right way on abortion for the right therefore who cares whether he was saying that he could grab women by the p-word and then there were allegations of sexual assault by a number of women some of whom were underage right and all of this goes by the wayside I hate this stuff I hate it the reason I hate it is because in the end the American people are going to have to decide what kind of people we are are we the kinds of people who care so much about the policy is a little about the character of our politicians that we are willing to elect the worst P in America just to defeat the other side or are we gonna have to get together and collectively bargain together against our own immorality because what we have here is a basic classic prisoner's dilemma I've talked about game theory on the program before a president prisoner's dilemma is essentially a situation in which your dominant strategy is to do the worst possible thing so to elucidate what a prisoner's dilemma is for purposes of this discussion think of two guys it's the movie LA Confidential starring Kevin Spacey and in that movie they they capture two suspects they put them in separate rooms and then they tell each suspect if you rat on the other guy then we will let you off but if you do not rat and the other guy wraps you out you're gonna get the max sentence if you bow trap both rat on each other then you're going to get somewhere in the Midway right you're gonna get instead of a 10-year sentence you'll both get a five-year sentence so the best solution for these guys would be to not testify to anything right the best solution would be for them to keep their mouths shut because then they'd be released the second best solution for both of them is if they is if they testified the other guy did something wrong right so if they both testify the other guy did something wrong that's the best possible solution because if you say the other guy did something wrong you get out and the other guy goes to jail well the problem is unless you really really trust the other guy you're both gonna cheat but you're both gonna say the other guy did something wrong you're gonna tell on each other and you're both gonna go to jail that's what's happening here with regard to bad people who are politicians right the right doesn't trust the left rightly so we don't trust that the left is gonna uphold any sort of moral standard with regard to their candidates we look at all of these politicians that they've supported despite how disgusting they are and we say well if you're not gonna support if you're not gonna withdraw support from politicians who do disgusting things why should we why should we hamper ourselves by handing you an Alabama Senate seat by not supporting somebody like Roy Moore this is immoral logic because there's an actual more the difference between a normal prisoner's dilemma and this is that there's an actual moral imperative for people to come out against sexual assault that does not exist in a normal prisoner's dilemma situation but you can see why everyone is falling into this trap right and left the left looks at the right they say you supported Trump why shouldn't we support Clinton the right looks at the left it says you supported Clinton why shouldn't we support Trump each looks at the other and they say you guys support bad guys why shouldn't we support bad guys and so we end up supporting bad guys we need to have a bargain with one another as Americans everyone needs to say I am NOT going to support bad people now here are the allegations about Roy Moore the easy way out for people on the right has been over the past 48 hours to basically say well it's not been proven one of the problems of sexual assault allegations is it's very difficult to prove them right particularly forty years after the fact if you believed Juanita Broderick but you don't believe Lake Hoffman you need to ask yourself why does it have something to do with politics or is there something more credible about Juanita Broderick than Mike Horstman I don't think there really is I think that lake orphan seems relatively credible and again you know one of the questions here is going to be does this fall apart over time does the story fall apart over time you know Roy Moore denies the allegations but you have to judge for yourself and I think that we all have to be intellectually honest do you doubt the story or do you doubt the story for political purposes right you doubt that the story is true or do you doubt it because you want to vote for Roy Moore because you want to support Roy Moore here's the allegation on Thursday the Washington Post dropped a bombshell report on Alabama Senate Republican nominee Roy Moore they allege he engaged in a sexual assault of a 14 year old and that he solicited multiple other underage women some four decades ago so according to Post report this is over a Daily wire in 1979 more then thirty two years old allegedly met a 14-year old girl named Lake Hoffman outside a courtroom he asked for her phone number picked her up at her home took her to his home where he quote took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes he touched her over her bra and Underpants she said and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear after that she asked him to take her home and he complied okay now there's that would be just one allegation but there are multiple allegations of more propositioning women who are very very young three other women between the ages of 16 and 18 say more proposition them during that same period the post adds that none of the women say that more actually forced them into any sort of relationship or sexual contact so it is slightly different than this more most egregious allegation according to the post Wendy Miller says she was 14 and working as a Santa's helper at the Gadsden Mall when Moore first approached her 16 when he asked her on dates which her mother forbade Debbie Wesley Wesson Gibson says she was 17 when Moore spoke to her high school civics class and asked her out on the first of several dates that did not progress beyond kissing Gloria fact are decent said she was an eighteen-year-old cheerleader when Moore began taking around dates that included bottles of mattias Rose a wine the legal drinking age in Alabama was 19 the last one you see the the Washington Post trying to stretch a little bit you know a 32 year old guy dating an 18 year old girl is not my cup of tea but suggesting that the real wrongdoing is that she drank ok underage drinking is a thing in the United States get the idea that 18 year-olds don't drink is just sewing in any case you know approaching 14 year-olds for Nate's and 16 year-olds for dates and 17 year-olds for dates when you are 32 years old yuck yuck so more denies the allegations Kaufman by the way voted for President Trump in she says she did not come out earlier on this story because she has thrice divorced and has children and was afraid that her story would be doubted so a lot of people on the right are saying this looks like a coordinated hit there's one month out from an election and Roy Moore suddenly is being hit with these charges it looks like an oppo dump right why are all these women coming out now now what the Post says is as soon as we started talking and see these women separately we went down to start reporting on this race this is the post says in the article we started reporting on the race we're ignoring it cuz it wasn't that important it's an Alabama Senate race the Republican always wins but we decide to go down and report on it and when we did there are these rumors about Roy Moore doing all these things we went and we reached out to all of these women they all spoke on the record they all gave their names and they all told us similar stories so that adds some credibility to these particular allegations so here's so so the question becomes number one whether people should support more and the second question becomes whether more should be moved off the ballot involuntarily it's very difficult to get more removed from the ballot if you do that you can't replace him with anybody else there's a sore loser law in Alabama that makes it nearly impossible for the Alabama Republican Party to replace him on the ballot now you remember back at all the way to 2002 the Democrats had a similar problem with a senator named bob torricelli bob the torturer Torricelli he was involved in corruption and the New Jersey Democrats sued to have him removed from the ballot and replaced on the ballot by someone else and the court ruled that was okay which was a violation of the law and a lot of Republicans were very upset about it well this is a similar sort of situation so Roy Moore is denying all this here is his statement he says today the judge Roy Moore campaign for US Senate issued a statement responding to yet another baseless political attack by The Washington Post a paper that is endorsed judge Moore's opponent more campaign chair bill Armistead released the following statement on Thursday afternoon quote judge Roy Moore has enjoyed the most outlandish any candidate in the modern political arena but this story in today's Washington Post alleging sexual impropriety takes the cake national liberal organizations know their chosen candidates Doug Jones in a death spiral and this is their last-ditch Hail Mary's so he's relying on the media bias charge again that carries some weight right you do have to say that the media bias charge carries some weight when the media you know the same Washington Post way back when I believe it was actually Newsweek way back when I was quashing Lewinsky stuff but you know the Washington Post is against Roy Moore but that's not changed the the credibility of the accusers right the accuser is our name again since the Washington Post has already endorsed the judges opponent and for months they've engaged in a systematic campaign to distort the truth about the judges record and career and derail his campaign in fact just two days ago the foundation for moral law sense or attractions a man to the post for the false stories they wrote about the judges work in compensation but apparently there is no end to what the post will allege that story by the way is still out there the post has not retracted that story that that story says that Roy Moore took about two hundred thousand dollars from the foundation for moral law for doing very little work indeed the statement continues the judge has been married to Kayla for nearly thirty three years has four children and five grandchildren he has been a candidate and for hotly-contested statewide political contest twice as a gubernatorial candidate twice as a candidate for chief justice has been a three-time candidate for local office has been a national figure in two groundbreaking judicial fights of a religious liberty and traditional marriage after 40 years of public service if any of these allegations were true they would have been made public long before now okay now that's not an argument I particularly like the argument that we would have known about this earlier because we now know that there are allegations that are surfacing about a wide variety of public figures that nobody knew earlier or if they did they were rumored but never confirmed right Harvey Weinstein was doing this crap for 20 years and we're fighting about it now Denny Hastert was the Speaker of the House for the Republicans for several years Denny Hastert turns out was molesting high school boys right so this idea that that it didn't come out for decades therefore it must not be true that's a little bit of weak T it's a little bit of weak to you they say the garbage is the very definition of thick news an intentional defamation you know the question is whether Roy Moore is gonna actually file a lawsuit even if it files a lawsuit no guarantee that the lawsuit is is either going to succeed or that approves that Roy Moore is innocent of the charges you can file a lawsuit and then later drop the lawsuit right without being countersued presumably president Trump has sounded off according to the press secretary she says that boy that Trump said quote he believes if allegations are true he will do the right thing and step aside it's calling for more to step aside if the allegations are true but that statement if the allegations are true is a pretty dicey one because again there's no way for anyone to confirm whether the allegations are true except based on except based on the word of the person who's talking about this so I know there are a lot of people who are thinking about you know why wouldn't these women come forward earlier why did they keep silent for so long and I think that it is important to read some of the accounts of women who didn't come forward earlier I'm just trying to be intellectually honest as I can be about this because I don't know and you don't know right I don't know whether it's true and you don't know whether it's true all we can do is go based on the allegations that are made by four different named women in the Washington Post report and somewhat substantiative by supposedly about 30 witnesses right so people who are talked to at the time I'm gonna get to why I think it's important to read the accounts of women who have kept silent for a long time about people who molested them in just a second but first I want to say thank you to

friendly with the Daily wire she's the wife of David French with whom I'm pretty good friends and Nancy has ghostwritten for a wide variety of right-wing public figures ranging from David Clarke to to Sarah Palin and and here is a here's what she says she does I used to admire men like Roy Moore because I loved everything about church the off-key acapella rendition of onward Christian soldiers the typos in the bulletin the ladies who smelled like Aqua Net with little Rouge circles on their cheeks and yes men like more who said long prayers around the show this changed one hot summer day when I needed to ride home from Vacation Bible School I was delighted when the preacher volunteered to drop me off as we drove I chatted incessantly happy to have him all to myself without people trying to get his attention in the church parking lot well he got to my house I was shocked that he walked me inside my dark house even more surprised when he lingered in conversation and thunderstruck when he kissed me right on the lips at 12 years old I swooned over my good luck he picked me out of all the girls of church but the relationship especially after he moved on reset my moral compass and fall the church conversation about morality and sexual purity was a lie what else was fake now that the family of God felt incestuous I rejected the church and myself didn't I want the preachers attention didn't I cause this when I careened from faith I made a series of poor romantic decisions that later almost cost me my life still I couldn't very well criticize the church because I was an utter emotional mess on Thursday all of this came back to me after I read one sentence in The Washington Post the article was about allegations that Alabama Senate candidate Roy more sexually touched a teenager when he was in his 30s a sentence from Leigh Kaufmann who was 14 at the time jumped out at me quote I felt responsible she said I swallow her back tears as I read the rest I felt like I had done something bad and I kind of set the course for me doing other things that were bad after her life spiraled with drinking drugs boyfriends she attempted suicide two years later in fact she didn't come forward earlier because she worried that her three divorces in poor financial history would make people doubt her story this is one of the reasons why women don't come forward sooner is because they do carry guilt when there are situations like this and sexual predators this is well known whether or not Roy Moore is one is still question you know but it is true sexual predators tend to target girls who are in a vulnerable state they tend to target girls who they can shed shed some sort of shadow on them their credibility if something is push it come to shove they'll build target girls who are fragile emotionally and and seen as unstable and then if the girl says something they'll say that it was fabricated and this is this very well-known that this is something that older male sexual predators will do okay with all of this said I'm gonna leave it up to you when I say I'm gonna leave it up to you I'm gonna say what here's here's my perspective and then I'm gonna say that you have you can have your own perspective I believe that these allegations are credible I believe the allegations are credible because this woman went on the record and because there are multiple women who that ROI more reached out to them as teenagers and that he went as far as they would allow them to go and then stopped when they said no right the allegations seem consistent to me and they seem credible to me with that said would I support Rome or the answer is no but that was not my line for supporting or I'm or I think the Roy Moore has said things that would lead me not to support him anyway now there is a complex calculus that goes on unfortunately in politics with regard to the impact of particular races we are willing to accept more bad behavior from a presidential candidate because the presidency is so important we're willing to accept bad behavior from Senate candidates because the Senate is so important if this guy were running for dogcatcher would you vote for him the answer is no if this guy were running for Congress would you vote for him the answer is probably no but you have to decide whether you believe the allegations are credible and then you have to take a good hard look inside yourself and determine whether you think the allegations are credible but you're looking the other way because you think that it is more important to elect someone who has done bad things but may implement an agenda that you like if that's the case then we really have reached the point where character means nothing in American politics like nothing and you're seeing this right you're seeing this the Alabama state auditor a guy named Jim Ziegler he here's what he said quote take the Bible Zechariah and Elizabeth for instance Zechariah was extremely old to marry Elizabeth and they became the parents of John the Baptist I also take Joseph and Mary Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter they became parents of Jesus okay well first of all I think it's kind of a miss read from what I understand about the New Testament the impression is that it was God impregnated Mary not not Joseph but in any case and also I'm not sure where it says that that Mary was a was a young teenager when all of this happened says that she was a Inara she said she was a young girl but it doesn't Nara can be a 20 year old in any case there's there a bunch of people who rushed to Roy Moore's defense on this there's a state representative ed Henry he said if they believe this man is predatory about the women they're guilty of allowing him to exist for 40 years I think someone should prosecute and go after them you can't be a victim forty years later in my opinion absolute nonsense of course he can be a victim forty years later and then you're seeing the people who are the most invested in Moore's victory speaking out on behalf of Roy Moore so Steven and who is who tried to take credit for Roy Moore winning the primaries against against Luther strange again I don't think Bannon picked Moore the bannon's supportive more actually push more to victory abandon is is now tied himself to Moore's leg now he's making the case in the same way that he made the case with regard to Donald Trump in the p-word tape he's now making the case with regard to Roy Moore that it's the media that we have to oppose here are the media report on alleged bad behavior and we can't say that the bad behavior is bad we have to hit the media instead and this does draw a distinction here right and this is the same distinction I made a little bit during the campaign and that is if you vote for Roy Moore while acknowledging that these allegations are credible you know I I have doubts about whether that is good voting logic but I think that it is possible for you to say I'm voting for a bad man to stop a pro-abortion zealot from entering Congress for example I think that's possible it's not a logic I hold because I think the character in our public servants matters but I think that you can hold two thoughts at once that somebody's a bad person and that you voted for them because the lesser of two evils right this is sort of the the Trump argument but what you're seeing from some people on the right is they're actually attempting to minimize what Moore's allegations wore right they're not they're not actually saying the allegations aren't true they're saying even if they are true it's not a big deal this is a step even beyond voting for more this is excusing evil behavior if you believe the allegations are true here's Steve Bannon basically doing that but it's interesting the Bezos Amazon Washington Post that dropped that dime on Donald Trump is the same Bezos Amazon Washington Post that dropped a dime to say afternoon on judge Roy Moore now is that a coincidence that's what I mean when I say opposition party right it's purely part of the apparatus of the Democratic Party they don't make any bones about it okay this is quite disgusting the Washington Post is a major newspaper they run reports on lots of people is the Washington Post that was doing a huge amount of research actually on Hillary's emails and despite all the rips on the mainstream media and I'll get to the mainstream media in just a second and their hypocrisy but for him to suggest that it's the Washington Post just a hit job dismiss the allegations out of hand because you don't like the allegations Steve is too smart for this but Steve is just manipulative enough for this I know Steve really well Steve smart and the him doing the Washington Post Amazon be so thing is just Steve knows better than this but Steve is doing it because obviously Steve wants to be seen as the head of this Trump estate and therefore he feels like he has to stand by Roy more Breitbart is out in full-scale defense this is not a shock to me I was there when Breitbart was out in full-scale defense of Donald Trump's p-word tape I remember it you were there you remember it I was there when they when they threw their own reporter under the bus after Donald Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski grabbed her by the arm hard enough to bruise her then lied about it publicly I was there for all of that so it's not it's no surprise to me the Breitbart has made itself into an arm of the more campaign and is now basically doing PR for more on this story a Joel Pollak who's an editor over there I know Joel pretty well Joel's on MSNBC last night again these are not defenses that these are not defenses that moral people should be making okay what Joel's about to say here is not a defense that a moral person should make the defense system or should be one these allegations are not credible and here's why I think allegations are not credible right that would be one of they would be the only real moral defense of this and then two would be maybe he's guilty of all of this but it's politics everybody's dirty I don't like that defense I think it's gross I don't agree with it I think that we all should have basic standards for our public servants but that would at least be a intellectually honest argument Joel's about to make a very intellectually dishonest argument I think in a moral argument here the 16 year old and the 18 year old have no business in that story because those are women of legal age of consent that's not my teenagers I mean you can you can argue that maybe they shouldn't be writing about teenagers but the point is it's not inaccurate my point is that the post has successfully put a narrative out at least on MSNBC and in other places that there's this pattern of teenagers there's really as far as we know the facts could come out differently but as far as we know there's only one relationship that's been alleged that's problematic okay I know if you're if you're making out with 16 year old at 33 that's it that's a problem that's a problem Joel has daughters he knows better than this and if you are if you're if you're allowing yourself to become the shill of a campaign to the point where you know you're saying stuff about a guy in your own side you would never say about anyone on the other side again flip the script for a second if there are allegations that Bill Clinton had molested a fourteen-year-old and then who is he asking me out 16 year olds and making out with him when he was 33 and an assistant DA which is what Roy Moore was at the time what do you think the right would be doing here's a little intellectual consistency not because I want a Democrat to take the seat in Alabama god forbid I don't want a Democrat to take the seaton Alabama my preferred solution here would be a write-in candidate from somebody to win that seat which is quite possible Lisa Murkowski just did it in Alaska there's no reason you couldn't have a right in Canada seat for someone who's not Judge more but one of the things that I think is is really gross is is the the capacity it's it's been amazing to me the capacity the human capacity to rewrite history and fact in order to avoid cognitive dissonance is an amazing thing to me it's an amazing thing to me you know the fact that there are so many people who are willing to rewrite in their own heads the facts of a given situation so they don't have to feel bad about what they're doing it's it's to me one of the the it is to me the number one problem with human beings just as a species our biggest problem is that we are unwilling to live with cognitive dissonance we are unwilling to live with the fact that some of the people we may like politically our bad people or do bad things and so instead what we end up doing is throwing all morals under the bus in order to protect people who we think are actually doing bad things again you'll make them the case that a 33 year old making out with a 16 year old girl is not a problem it's pretty amazing it's pretty amazing and pretty disgusting okay so before I go any further and I want to talk about the media hypocrisy here too before I go any further I want to talk a little bit about our brand-new sponsors over at filter by comm so one of the things that you never think about in your house is the air quality you never think about it because who thinks about their quality who thinks about the the the vents who thinks about the filters that you use on the vents well you don't think about it and what you do is you leave those filters in there for five years and then you look at them and they are completely black and they've been filtering out nothing and it turns out that your house is full of dust and mold and gross in US that's why you need to go to filter by dot-com filter by comm sends you the size you need within 24 hours plus free shipping they use double industry standard emmy RV rating on most filter sizes and all their filters are manufactured right here in the united states they can ship any size into any quantity and you save 5% when you set up auto delivery which is great you know auto delivery is what i would recommend with filter by comm because it'll just deliver the new filters to you on a regular basis and that way you never have to think about it again it just comes in the mail you say oh look it came in the mail that means it's time for me to replace my filter you replace the filter and everything is good to go go to filter Icom today get the best price on top quality filters shipped within 24 hours plus free shipping filter by com that's filter by dot-com again you never have to think about air quality again when it just comes in the mail and you stick it in the vent and everything is good to go it's a no-brainer filter by dot-com best price shipped to you for free within 24 hours and save 5% when you get auto delivering filter by dot-com check it out okay so none of this is to ignore the hypocrisy of the left when it comes to these sorts of sexual assault and sexual harassment allegations Bernie Sanders for example he comes 40 says that that Judge more should step aside I first have to ask you about this revelation about a man who could be your colleague in a matter of weeks whether you think the Republican Party serves hope that he let let us hope that he will not be my colleague or anybody else's colleague you know I I think you I've heard Chris that there are a number of Republicans who are saying that at this particular time given these horrific charges against mr. Moore that it would be appropriate pay him to step aside and again it's a you know III may not yeah I just I I may agree with Bernie Sanders but where was Bernie Sanders on Bill Clinton was he arguing for him to step aside and this is the logic that so many people are using today they're using this logic I use this logic to turn to Bob Menendez saying you know it would be nice if the media presented you know one-tenth the effort on Bob Menendez that they will join more now people are saying well yeah but they've got reporters at Bob Menendez is hearing right they've got Politico and CNN is covered it's true but the New York Times is a very large newspaper okay there are a lot of pages in that newspaper is Bob Menendez on page one or is he on page a I even cover stuff and still bury it ok so then so news busters has done a pretty good study on this and here's what they found yesterday ok this is the in the in from nine from September 6th to Olive 4 to November 10th ok from from 9 6 to 11 10 okay they've covered this here all the shows and how they have covered Bob Menendez okay ABC's Good Morning America again this is over a month of coverage actually it's um it's almost two minutes more than two months of coverage in two months of coverage ABC's Good Morning America I mentioned it for a combined 1 minute 48 seconds CBS this morning 22 seconds NBC's Today 0 ABC's World News Tonight 0 CBS this morning 0 NBC Nightly News zero Roy Moore it is the first 24 hours Good Morning America 7 minutes CBS this morning 5 minutes 22 seconds NBC today 4 minutes 22 seconds ABC World News Tonight 2 minutes 48 seconds CBS this morning 2 minutes 46 seconds NBC Nightly News 2 minutes 38 seconds if you want to know why everybody is lowering their standards is because nobody has any standards if the media were consistent about this stuff if the media said they corrupt people should resign then everybody would be on the same page but it's very difficult for you to say that people of the other guy's party should resign but people of my own party should remain and that's that's a very difficult allegation to make again another one of the people who's been doing this is Stephen Colbert you know his Stephen Colbert goes after as you'll see both Donald Trump and Roy Moore in this particular clip besides the 14 year old girl the post talked to three other women who say more pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s my god these accusations are so damning voters are either gonna force him off the ballot or make him president okay well you know that that's not a Clinton joke that's a Trump joke obviously it's a Trump joke now I would just like to point out Stephen Colbert has had David Letterman on his show multiple times David Letterman was apparently sexually harassing to help over it over at the Late Show that was the allegation anyway so any I guess there was a settlement out of court and all the rest of it which brings us to Hollywood right we're gonna get to Hollywood in just a second where the sexual allegations are flying fast and furious and yet you're seeing that this stuff was allowed to go on Halle wouldn't everybody know about it for 40 years and nobody did anything about it I do want to point out one another area of media hypocrisy and that is really media malpractice so you know I've said that I think Sean Hannity's coverage of President Trump has been rather sycophantic but that it was very unfair last night all the entire left media jumped on Shawn suggesting that Shawn had defended child molestation I here's Chris Hayes on MSNBC suggesting that Hannity defended child molestation or the past month Senate Republicans have made it something of an art form out of ignoring questions about really Moore's basic fitness for office a man who was removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for ethical reasons man who believes that quote homosexual conduct should be illegal a man and once that congressman keith Ellison shouldn't be allowed in Congress because he is Muslim I anticipated a fake news attack I anticipated tonight tonight and I wash and post his fake news what I did not anticipate was watching a bunch of conservatives today bend over backwards to defend molesting a child and yet somehow that's apparently where we are I thought I'd lost my capacity for shock but reading like these are these are just some of the statements from the local Alabama officials who were talking to Daniel Dale today at the Toronto Star about this behavior it was 40 years ago I really don't see the relevance of it she was 32 she was supposedly 14 she's not saying anything happen other than they kissed other than being with an underaged person he really forced himself I know it's bad enough but I don't know if he withdraws it's five weeks the election that would concede that the Democrat there is no option to support Doug Jones the Democratic nominee when you do that you were supporting the entire Democrat Party it's like I felt you were talking about this being profound it's profound in the sense that there's nothing that Roy Moore could do that is going to detach the party from him it appears okay and then he went directly after Sean Hannity suggesting that Hannity had personally defended chat molestation that is not true here's the actual clip of Sean Hannity talking about Roy Moore he did not say is there's a lot of crosstalk here he did not say that it was a consensual encounter with a fourteen-year-old he was talking about consensual encounters with the 17 or 18 year old it was apparently like 32 and he dated one girl was 18 one girl was 17 they never said he did there's no sexual there's kissing involved and then they're saying this one intentional and consensual that's true and there's you know I just ain't Sean it's clearly not talking about the fourteen-year-old there so the media jumped on this Media Matters jumped on this they called for boycotts of Sean it just demonstrates how politicized all this stuff has become we should all be on the same page about this stuff happening about how it's bad right and I think that the fact that we are not demonstrates how much politics has infused our our lifeblood and poison the well really poisoned the law okay so I want to talk about louis c.k and the allegations against Louie CK but for

largest fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation so speaking of hypocrisy the entire Hollywood infrastructure that spent years basically making excuses for everyone in Hollywood and ignoring it but when after Donald Trump and is now going after Roy Moore well they got hit hard again to let yesterday louis c.k the allegations are is that movie CK has a nasty habit of touching himself in inappropriate ways before unsuspecting women in 2002 louis c.k who by the way yeah there's this there's a sort of hot take online that you can't like louis ck's comedy now the bad stuff has come out about him Louie CK is freaking hilarious okay he's a really good comedian he's also a garbage human being apparently okay so both things can be true at once we had a conversation in the hallway before the show about separating the art from the artist about whether you can still laugh at Bill Cosby's comedy from 1969 knowing what Bill Cosby did and I think the answer is yes you can still laugh at it just don't give him your money right I think that you can still watch a Roman Polanski film we can still watch knife in the water and sin it's a good movie and still say the guy who made it's a creep guy is a rapist right I mean I think that you can you can do those things you don't have to like burn every Buffalo Bills tape you have from the 1980s because OJ Simpson killed his ex-wife I just think it's important just as a society to recognize that because otherwise we'd start setting up the societal let this test that are very weird like you mentioned that you watch The Cosby Show who you must not care about date rape that's silly okay in any case CK apparently asked two female comedians in 2002 to comes his hotel room and then he proceeded to get naked and pleasure himself before them that was not his only time doing this he did it in 2003 to Abby Schaffner apparently in 2005 to rebecca quarry and the this story from the New York Times resulted in the cancellation of the premiere of his new movie as well as Stephen Colbert's Late Night Show appearance apparently in the new movie there's a scene where Charlie Day playing one of the characters niblet mimics publicly pleasuring himself and in which characters appeared to dismiss rumors of sexual predation it's this is really gross stuff and amazingly enough you're seeing a lot of the Hollywood elites avoiding talking about it for sure so you're seeing like Aziz Ansari apparently was asked directly about he said I have no comment how you not have comment how is this tough like legitimately how is this tough and again these are allegations let's say that Luis he can come out and denied them the women are on the record talking about them would you deny them all right let's talk about Kevin Spacey for just a second okay because the allegations about Roy Moore and Kevin Spacey are actually quite similar the allegation about Kevin Spacey was that he took a 14 year old to a party and then brought him in the bedroom and tried to sexually molest him the allegation about Roy Moore is that he picked up a 14 year old and brought her back to his house and tried to sexually molest her right those are the allegations and the allegation is by the way exactly the same in the sense that when the 14 year old sent his Spacey stop apparently spaced he stopped and when the 14 year old said a Remora stop Roy Moore apparently stopped now some people are saying well spacey didn't deny the allegations more is this is you know it's true that that is a significant difference it is also true that if Kevin Spacey had tonight it would you believe it would you believe it if Kevin Spacey had denied it or did you say probably happened especially since the actor was willing to go on the record again I'm just pointing out here folks try to be intellectually honest with yourself that's how you know whether you are you are acting in accordance with your morality is if you ask yourself these tough questions and I'm not telling you which way you have to come down and told you how I come down what I think is the moral thing to do but if you choose differently that's your problem it's a free country but at least be honest about what you're doing okay time for some of the things I like things I hate in the mailbag so things I like there's a movie out by know about Noah Baumbach who is not my favorite director I really don't like his work very much but the mayor what story's on Netflix which is now getting all sorts of it's getting rave reviews and also it's getting buried because Dustin Hoffman was accused of sexual harassment and he stars in the movie he was seen as somebody who would be up for an Oscar nomination probably for this the movie itself is not any great shakes it's nothing where you watch it you're like I'm blown away by this film but it is such a wonderfully backhanded critique of New York liberal culture that it's pretty spectacular from that perspective like when you watch it as a conservative it's sort of conservative porn it's sort of like you're watching it and you're realizing that the I don't know if bomb back meds it this way probably not but the whole thing is a brutal critique of New York Upper East Side Jewish liberalism and it's a very Jewish movie obviously the mayor what stories meant to be that way but it's it really has nothing to do with Jews because these people you know don't have anything with Judaism there's just New York liberals all right here is the here's a little bit of the preview you this place is a client that's why we could get a table so last-minute that's why they gave us this bigger table I imagine will sent some complimentary stuff to $55 for a steak known for their meat here than $35 for a salmon get the salmon to blow you for that price Harold meyerwitz a son Matthew yes mrs. Danny also felt my Ehrlich's a son I didn't realize you have two sons and a daughter it would be okay here it'll be nice to spend time with that no I didn't get a lot of time with him growing up they pictures comedy but really isn't a comedy as much as it is sort of a dramedy so basically the characters are you know Ben Stiller is the successful son who is not artistic so here's a here's sort of the plot you can pause the the trailer so the so when when you actually hear the so here's that here's the plot basically Dustin Hoffman is an aging sculptor okay and he's never created anything that really is meaningful or great but he's sort of a minor artist and his sons are Adam Sandler who is a former pianist who is unsuccessful and has been basically a househusband taking care of his kid and and his other son has been Stiller they're half-brothers they have merits the Dustin Hoffman character has been married three separate four separate times I guess in the movie an old ones three divorces and he is and he is a jerk he's a jerk who sees himself as a genius he basically ignored Adam Sandler when Adam Sandler was a kid but he was very warm to Ben Stiller Ben Stiller didn't turn out to be artistic but he went out made a lot of money Adam Sandler ended up being kind of a househusband and so the whole movie is sort of about their relationship with Dustin Hoffman what's fascinating about it is that it's meant to I think the movie is trying to say that art is that that art is worth it but there is one key speech that Adam Sandler gives where he basically says I have to think that my dad was a genius cuz otherwise he's just a jackass basically and it does demonstrate I think in a backhanded way how the artistic community thinks about itself it's okay to be a bad person so long as you create good art I think embedded in here is one of the messages that is plaguing Hollywood right now that Hollywood actually believes that if you make good art that justifies you being an awful human being and Dustin Hoffman sort of gets away with it in the film being an awful human being but that's that's sort of the problem and I'm not sure that I'm not sure Bombeck meant to say that but if he didn't he should have because I think it's an important message okay things I things I hate so I mean the entire news cycle would be the thing I hate today the other thing that I hate is that Hillary Clinton is trying to claim that she is now that she and her movement are now responsible the fever in America has broken then now Americans are finally coming back to their senses you know I think the fever is finally breaking I think that Americans and as we saw last night are saying you know what we really like our health care we don't like hatred and bigotry and we don't want to get shot wherever we go and we don't want to be shot wherever we go I mean I can't imagine why I can't imagine why we didn't elect this woman president hey what a harridan the idea that anyone wants to be shot wherever they go that's why we own guns it's just asinine the idea that everyone who voted for Trump is a racist it's just disgusting an asinine the fever is not going to break because everyone has a fever okay the reason everyone has a fever is because our politics have taken over our morality and Hillary Clinton is one of the main drivers in that okay time for the mailbag so Calvin says hey man I'm a huge fan of yours but I live in Australia would you ever consider coming here to speak yeah actually we've had some invitations from Australia big travel like that to Australia it always means that we have to bundle together a bunch of speeches so we are working on that we're also working as I say on a trip to the UK at some point in the relatively near future menachem says hey Ben's you believe that aliens and ghosts exist I think that there's a better shot that aliens exist and ghosts exist I don't believe in ghosts in the sense that I don't think that like a core period that corporeal beings are wandering around the hallways of your house I think that once once your dad your dad I don't think that you're you know coming back to talk to people except maybe in dreams but the idea that you're like wandering around attempting to communicate with the with the living world is not something I buy I think the spiritual world in the physical world are somewhat separate the idea that aliens exist possible I mean there are a lot of planets out there would they be intelligent not necessarily but I think it's it's implausible to me that there are that many planets in that many stars and nowhere has a one-celled organism lived you know that I find implausible Kathak says hey man you've held very strong political opinions since you were young has having children changed any of your earlier positions not really because I think I like the way I was raised I mean I think that one of the things that when you have kids what to change your positions as you tend to get a little bit stricter on moral matters but I grew up in an area that was strict on moral matters and I grew up in a good situation so I never felt the need to buck them I think a lot of people move from sort of libertarianism toward conservatism when they have kids I was already conservative socially so there's no place for me to move Janey says I'm working on a paper concerning judicial review I've always been enticed by your objections to judicial review I've heard your rudimentary arguments against it would like to dive that a lot deeper into the issue what works are authors do you recommend besides Waldron if judicial review were abolished would there then be a need for written Constitution there'd be a need for written constitutions that we would at least have a document around rich to rally right you still have to swear your oath to uphold the Constitution in every office judicial review would just not make the judiciary the final repository of judgment on judicial review that they're a bunch of books on judicial review and the problems with it Bork has talked about it extensively in tempting of America they're also I'm trying to remember the name of the fellow who very very famous book on judicial review I'll have to look it up and I'll get back to you I'm sorry Kyle says when you run for president will you ask Stephen Crowder to be a running mate I'll ask Stephen Crown Derby of my lifting mate he seems like that's that's more his thing Cedric says hey bends you also ship the magnificent left this year's tumblr abroad to Europe I don't know guys do we I do not know the answer to that so I'll have to I'll have to find that out Rowan says dear Ben the government has to provide essential services like police and fire protection yet even with a flat tax the richest taxpayers still pay much more in absolute dollars than the poorest taxpayers in other words the rich are paying for the poorest police and fire services why then is it any different if taxes are used to provide health care well I mean it's different because the role of the government is different if you're asking why a flat tax is better than a progressive tax it's because percentages are still proportionate and the idea of proportionality is still better than non proportionality as far as what services are used these are two separate questions they did the the veracity of a flat tax versus what the tax dollars should be used for are two separate questions I don't think tax dollars should be used for health care because in the end your health care is individually your responsibility whereas fire and police protection are in the end communal responsibilities since fire can jump home to home and because crime has as communal effect okay Sarah says hey Ben you advertised your ability to better my life via subscription to the day the wire alright so I'm an annual subscriber and a current student UCLA and I cannot get a spot to listen to you come speak next week can I cash it on your offer to better my life by finding me an extra seat to attend email me Sara and I will do my best just and says my sister is 15 years old she's being influenced by her asked sjws friends at school and become it became anti-trump without good reason other than how he handles himself on Twitter how do I go about positively persuading her to conservative ideas and red pilling her without sounding condescending well I think that first of all I think that a lot of what Trump says on Twitter is really dumb I mean hope you'd like this has been a thing that I've been saying for years now I think that you can uphold conservative principles without having to defend everything Trump does and this is a big mistake I think people make so don't let that be the hill you die on in other words don't die on the hill of Trump's Twitter is great that seems to me a bad hill to die on politically Brian says hi then I have heard your opinion on abortion numerous times in avid listener my question is what is your opinion on the morning-after pill I'm truly curious and appreciate your opinion so my opinion on the morning-after pill is that the morning-after pill is abortion pill again once a human life has been conceived meaning that it the egg has been fertilized then you are talking about the destruction of that incipient human life and that is a problem to me Jonathan says dear Ben how do you feel about labor laws as conservatives one of our core principles is limited government do you believe in the government having labor laws such as a standard 40-hour workweek thanks no I don't believe the government ought to be able to bargain on my behalf against my employer it is my job to bargain on my behalf against my employer I am for private-sector unions that do just this I'm for private-sector unions that do just this I am NOT for private or public sector unions that take advantage of tax dollars or a legislation that restricts my rights to contract with someone freely by the way I do have an answer from our producers now we do in fact ship the tumblers overseas so if you are in Europe feel free to subscribe and get the tumbler now Mason says one passage of the Bible that is always interested me is the story of the Tower of Babel which obviously comes right after the story of Noah I've always struggled with this passage because I don't see what would be wrong with the people building a city and a great tower I was wondering if you could elaborate on the meaning of this passage sure so I actually was planning on doing this next week but I may as well do it now the basic idea of the Tower of Babel is that as communitarianism at its worst so the idea of the Tower of Babel is that they're not building the tower to better the lives of the inhabitants they're not building the tower in order to anything useful it specifically says they're building a tower in order to challenge God in other words the idea is that we are going to build these massive edifices to demonstrate the capacity of humans as a community to build amazing things and the Midrash you know a lot of the commentaries on the Torah they talk about the idea that if a human being the tower was so great that if a human being would die in the building of the tower they would just take the body and stack it into the tower and then when you would stop to bury the guy the idea here is that this is much more like a fascist regime that it's a fascist regime that directs all of the communal labor toward the creation of these massive monuments not started that's where the betterment of individuals lives not sort of the betterment of family situations but instead a community directed not toward the betterment of individuals with value but directed instead at building giant things in order to demonstrate that human beings are more powerful than God that's actually what it says right there in the Bible ok so this brings us to the end of this week's mailbag
