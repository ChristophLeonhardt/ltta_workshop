well now joining us I really want to take some time to say hello to a guy who's become a friend and I think also is a terrific candidate over in Missouri his name is Austin Peterson you of course know him as a guy who ran for the Libertarian Party nomination should have won because I mean God how could the Libertarian Party possibly do any worse than Gary Johnson my god but Austin Peterson is currently running as a Republican for the US Senate out of Missouri he's homegrown Missourian pro-life Pro Liberty Pro Constitution his top priorities include promoting job growth leveling the healthcare playing field pushing a flat tax a 15 percent across-the-board decreasing spending and acting criminal justice reform and keeping America first in foreign policy Austin thanks for joining the show I'm eager to talk to you yeah thanks yeah exactly so let's start at the beginning you are a self-described libertarian but now you're running inside the Republican Party why not continue trying to take over the most useless party in America the libertarian party great question yeah so I actually did it the old-fashioned way I spent two months on the phones talking to my supporters I called Dow 4,000 people and 100% said run 98% or more including registered Republican libertarians and even some Democrats said run as a Republican because they think that it's gonna take some time to clean up the mess from last year and frankly they want to win the Liberty movement it's a win in this country and what better opportunity to interrelate progressive Democrat with a very libertarian Republican so what do you think are the differences between and kind of conservatives and libertarians as you see them because there is this split inside the Republican Party between so-called conservatives and so-called libertarians and it's sort of hard to pin down where those splits exist because there are so many different types of people inside the Republican Party of Lindsey Graham folks you have Ted Cruz folks you have people who are libertarian on social policy but are more heavily into spending you have people who are it is it's all over the place so where do you see the major splits occurring and more importantly where do you see the synthesis between conservatives and libertarians that can paint some sort of roadmap for the future well I think true conservatives tend to agree with libertarians that whatever your opinions are on social issues you don't think that the government should be imposing those values on other people that's why last year the big question was whether or not you should force a Christian to bake a wedding cake for a gay wedding right so Christians and you know conservative libertarians and libertarian libertarians whether they you know may agree with gay marriage or disagree with it both agree that the government shouldn't legislate it they shouldn't force people to it to it and then that's why we both agreed the government shouldn't be in the marriage business right so I think if you're a traditional conservative you're gonna agree with more libertarians on this but now we have so many different factions of people calling themselves conservatives like the populace the new wave of populace that you've been talking about the all right these are people who are calling themselves conservatives you know we have all of these groups at war with one another trying to define what a conservative is but is actually why there's a good opportunity I think in the Republican Party despite all of the chaos for people who are true principled conservatives and libertarians to come in and to rebuild the Republican Party into what it shouldn't have been which was a limited government party because I think there's no hope for the Democrats right the Democrats are in lockstep they want bigger government you shouldn't waste your time with the Democratic Party but in the Republican Party there is an opportunity and it's funny because you know I do we've both criticized Trump and his criticizing all right but a lot of these people because they don't have a philosophical backing they are right to be converted to true conservative principles fiscal conservatism they do call themselves broadly conservative I think they just get confused on some of these issues some of the economic issues when it comes to free trade which I think there's a great opportunity for people like ourselves to discuss right especially right now when we're gonna be talking about this budget battle we're talking about daca and immigration you know how we can conservative and libertarian values is gonna be really the debate but because there are so many functions on the right that's why we see the chaos on the left they're all in lockstep and that's what you get with collectivism but on the right or not collectivist we're individualist so it's much more difficult to the farm awesome what I've argued for a long time is the future of the Republican Party and the conservative movement is going to lie and conservatives recognizing some truths about themselves and libertarians recognizing some truths about themselves libertarians generally tend to label conservatives religious fanatics who only care about their Bible and and and this is sort of the the resistance you see in a lot of conservative circles to more traditional libertarians and then conservatives see libertarians as Libertines you know they're all people who want to smoke dope and have sex with whatever they want to have sex with and it seems to me that the the happy medium here is conservatives recognizing the libertarians are correct about the role of government and libertarians recognizing that conservatives are correct about the necessity for a social fabric a moral and virtuous people outside the rommel government not to be imposed by government but if you don't have social institutions that are picking up the gap then you should that libertarians should be very much in favor of the growth of social institutions that are not forced down by government because without those you're going to devolve into some form of leftism one hundred percent agree actually one of the biggest mistakes I made in my early days of libertarian thinking was to argue that some of these social institutions weren't necessary maybe they should be weekend so that individualism can rise but I think you know there is a form of collectivism that is is voluntary right so I mean some people even call themselves voluntary socialists whatever that may be the idea is is that we if we whatever our values are that we don't force them on one another right some people are Muslims some people are Christians some people are Jews and those are arguably some form of collectivism but they should be a voluntary form of collectivism right the problem of course with Islam today is that you can't voluntary leave Islam in most of the world and that that does set it apart between is between Christianity and Judaism but libertarians I think do need to argue for social institutions I mean you know take a look at you know like Christianity for example I mean you see so many of these these churches going down and giving aid in Hurricane Katrina that's the kind of volunteerism that libertarians would like to see and people say Austin you know you're not a Christian they say you are so are you hostile to religion I say no absolutely not because I think that religion you should be the driving force behind charity and not government I prefer religion to government because at least religion is voluntary and I think that we did better when religion was the main driver driving force behind charities so I think as government has grown people have gotten rid of the concept of God and they've replaced the government with God and that's become problematic because the state is forced it's fire and it's coercion and so we do need social institutions like you know families friends neighbors and churches to step in when we have crises like Texas and hopefully not coming up in Florida one of the things that a lot of conservatives worry about with sort of the libertarian movement I with national defense there's some pretty significant splits inside the libertarian movement on what constitutes a libertarian uh national offense you have people who are like Larry elder who's sort of a hawkish national defense guy who considers himself libertarian then you have people like Ron Paul who's a very minimalist foreign policy guy when it comes to when it comes to the role of government where do you stand in terms of what is the role of the military and the police but let's start with the military and foreign policy what do you think American foreign policy should look like well I do believe that we need a national defense and the type of threats that were special North Korea well I do argue with anarchist libertarians sometimes and they'll say well you know North Korea we need to just stand down we need to stop provoking them and I say okay well what happens when they put a nuclear missile on the launch pad they say well just wait you have to wait until they fire first I'm like okay well let's say North Korea actually launches the nuclear weapon they say okay well then we just blow it out of the sky and I have to say well with what Air Force you didn't fund the Air Force so we can't do that so they're there does need to be a realistic foreign policy I do consider myself a foreign policy realist but I think not even you would argue or not even the most hardcore rabid hawk would argue that we need to be involved in every single civil war around the world we need to be very strategic about that and when we're focused on threats in Afghanistan and and in in the Middle East and in Iraq we're not focusing on the bigger threats in places like North Korea so I don't want to see it spread too thin yes I do tend to fall more towards the wrong Paul side of things but I do believe in our Constitution I do believe in the military I do think that we need to have a national defense but again what you don't want to do is to be a bull in a china shop and try and be involved with every single conflict because I don't know that it necessarily defends our national interests and we could we could go through these piecemeal and go through them wanted to talk but I'm you know would you say every single conflict we've been involved the last 50 75 years has been in our national interest I don't think you would so I think we just need to be more prudent and I also think we need to balance it out with having proper War Powers I think Congress needs to have proper debates before we're involved unless it's an immediate threat to our national security the president does have authority under the War Powers Act to act in our national self-interest and then go back to Congress and justified which I think if it was a significant threat I think anybody would say yes Congress would authorize it but we need to have a significant debate and we need to have proper separation of powers and checks and balance okay Austin so obviously in this particular election run against Claire McCaskill who is the incumbent who are some of the other it's unclear to me who's running on the Republican side so far it seems like it's pretty wide open on the Republican side for the nomination have you seen any polling do you know where you stand in that and and what's your plan to defeat McCaskill where where do you think her great vulnerabilities lie honestly I think that Claire McCaskill can be defeated by any generic Republican because the polls actually said she loses to generic Republican by 10 points so as long as we don't get what happened six years ago with the Todd akin candidacy where he said some very stupid things then we should be fine but of course the real challenge is going to be in the Republican primary some people see me as an outsider which is actually kind of a good thing it's interesting because the current Attorney General of Missouri is looking at getting into the race he's obviously got the backing of the big people like Mitch McConnell and and you know the big wigs and the Republican Party they're gonna give him millions and millions of dollars but Politico dropped a poll recently showed that 72% of Republicans want somebody to run against him and 45% of Republicans don't even want him to run and this is an open primary state and it's one where you don't have to have 50% or more to win you just need a plurality so in a wide-open race the different kind of Republican which I embody and I exemplify could pull out a victory we just need more support from conservatives like yourselves around the country and I think that we can lock in and win well I think we should all help out Austin Peterson so Austin where can we help you out in your Senate race
