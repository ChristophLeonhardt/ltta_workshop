1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,638
>> WE'RE STARTING OFF ON A

2
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:13,173
NEW FOOTING A WONDERFUL

3
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:14,741
THING RELEASED THE FOLKS

4
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:15,041
EARLY.

5
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:15,975
THAT WAS A BIG THING.

6
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,343
I REALLY THINK WE HAVE A

7
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:18,378
VERY GOOD CHANCE OF DOING

8
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:19,679
SOMETHING VERY MEANINGFUL.

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,080
I REALLY THINK A LOT OF

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,015
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE.

11
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:24,884
AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

12
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:25,451
STEVE: WE'LL SEE WHAT

13
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:25,785
HAPPENS.

14
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:27,253
THE PRESIDENT SOUNDING VERY

15
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:27,854
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT'S

16
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:28,755
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH NORTH

17
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:30,223
KOREA AND HIS SUMMIT.

18
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:31,558
IN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE.

19
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:33,726
LET'S TALK TO WHITE HOUSE

20
00:00:33,726 --> 00:00:34,294
PRESS SECRETARY SARAH

21
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:34,794
HUCKABEE SANDERS.

22
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:37,030
SHE JOINS US FROM THE NORTH

23
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,597
LAWN.

24
00:00:37,597 --> 00:00:38,298
SARAH, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

25
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:39,332
>> GOOD MORNING.

26
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:40,800
GREAT TO BE WITH YOU GUYS.

27
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,501
STEVE: WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

28
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:41,935
NORTH KOREA?

29
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:42,969
>> LOOK, AS THE PRESIDENT

30
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:45,538
HAS SAID TIME AND TIME

31
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:46,339
AGAIN, WE'RE READY TO MEET

32
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:48,541
AND IF IT HAPPENS, THAT'S

33
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:48,841
GREAT.

34
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:49,876
AND IF IT DOESN'T, WE WILL

35
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:52,478
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

36
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:53,713
WE'RE STILL HOPEFUL THAT THE

37
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:55,114
MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE AND

38
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:57,617
WE'LL CONTINUE DOWN THAT

39
00:00:57,617 --> 00:00:57,917
PATH.

40
00:00:57,917 --> 00:00:58,585
AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW

41
00:00:58,585 --> 00:00:59,485
THAT WE HAVE BEEN PREPARED

42
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:01,020
THAT THESE COULD BE TOUGH

43
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,454
NEGOTIATIONS.

44
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:03,122
THE PRESIDENT IS READY IF

45
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:04,290
THE MEETING TAKES PLACE.

46
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,692
AND IF IT DOESN'T, WE WILL

47
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:06,826
CONTINUE THE MAXIMUM

48
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:08,561
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN THAT'S

49
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:09,429
BEEN ONGOING.

50
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:11,231
BRIAN: HOW WOULD YOU

51
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:12,265
CHARACTERIZE THE PRESIDENT'S

52
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:13,533
REACTION TO THIS BACK STEP

53
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:14,767
MAKING UP SOME PROBLEMS WITH

54
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:15,768
MILITARY EXERCISES THAT HAVE

55
00:01:15,768 --> 00:01:17,570
BEEN ON THE BOOKS COMING UP

56
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,738
WITH COMMENTS ABOUT JOHN

57
00:01:18,738 --> 00:01:22,175
BOLTON THAT'S BEEN SET BACK

58
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:22,542
IN 2003.

59
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:23,776
WHAT WAS THE PRESIDENT'S

60
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:24,811
REACTION WHEN SOME OF THIS

61
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:25,778
STUFF STARTED COMING OUT?

62
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:26,946
>> LOOK, THE PRESIDENT IS

63
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:28,681
THE TOUGHEST NEGOTIATOR

64
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:29,015
AROUND.

65
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:30,283
HE IS PREPARED TO GO THROUGH

66
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,150
THIS PROCESS.

67
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,252
HIS TEAM IS PREPARED TO GO

68
00:01:32,252 --> 00:01:34,354
THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

69
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:36,089
AND THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

70
00:01:36,089 --> 00:01:38,124
THAT IS OUT OF THE ORDINARY

71
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:39,592
IN THESE TYPES OF

72
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:40,760
OPERATIONS.

73
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,797
THE PRESIDENT'S FULLY

74
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:45,965
PREPARED AND FULL NAMELY

75
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:48,401
READY TO CARRY ON IN THESE

76
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:49,402
CONVERSATIONS LEADING UP TO

77
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:50,403
AND IF THE MEETING TAKES

78
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:50,703
PLACE.

79
00:01:50,703 --> 00:01:54,007
HE WILL BE READY.

80
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:55,475
>> WHY WE NEED SOME PEOPLE

81
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:58,011
IN THESE ROLLS IN THE

82
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:58,478
ADMINISTRATION.

83
00:01:58,478 --> 00:01:59,579
GINA HASPEL, THE SENATE

84
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:00,246
INTEL COMMITTEE VOTING ON

85
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:00,880
HER TODAY.

86
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,081
WE KNOW SHE HAS MADE THE

87
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,483
ROUNDS UP ON THE HILL.

88
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:04,317
SENT A PERSONAL LETTER TO

89
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:05,818
MARK WARNER.

90
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:07,120
IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE HAS THE

91
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,054
VOTES SHE NEEDS, SARAH.

92
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:09,354
>> IT LOOKS GREAT.

93
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:11,224
WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC.

94
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:12,058
WE THINK OBVIOUSLY GINA

95
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:14,193
HASPEL IS THE MOST QUALIFIED

96
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:15,128
AND CREDIBLE PERSON THAT YOU

97
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:17,030
COULD FIND TO RUNT CIA.

98
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,865
WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT HER

99
00:02:18,865 --> 00:02:25,505
TAKING THE HYMN AS THE

00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:25,605

FULL FLOOR VOTE TAKING PLACE

115
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:35,481
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

116
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:37,984
WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT AND

117
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:38,951
OPTIMISTIC PEOPLE ARE

118
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:39,585
PUTTING NATIONAL SECURITY

119
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:40,286
AND THE SAFETY AND SECURITY

120
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,554
OF AMERICANS AHEAD OF

121
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:42,689
PARTISAN POLITICS.

122
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:43,389
SEVERAL DEMOCRATS HAVE COME

123
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:45,625
OUT AND SAID THEY WILL

124
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,192
SUPPORT GINA HASPEL.

125
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:47,126
WE THINK THAT'S A GREAT

126
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,561
THING BECAUSE SHE IS A GREAT

127
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:49,896
CANDIDATE TO RUN THE CIA AND

128
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:51,164
WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT HER

129
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:52,165
TAKING OVER AND MOVING

130
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,233
FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS.

131
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:54,834
STEVE: WE HEARD FROM THE

132
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,936
PRESIDENT DOING A TWEET A

133
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:58,071
COUPLE DAYS AGO ABOUT THE

134
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,005
LEAKS IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

135
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:03,076
YOU KNOW, IT ALL GOES BACK

136
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:04,577
TO ROUGH COMMENT THAT A

137
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:05,578
MEMBER OF THE WHITE HOUSE

138
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:08,848
STAFF MADE ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN

139
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:10,016
AND THEN THERE WAS A LEAK

140
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:10,416
ABOUT THAT.

141
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,551
YOU HAD A MEETING WITH THE

142
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:12,785
TEAM ABOUT LEAKS AND THAT

143
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:13,386
GOT LEAKED.

144
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:15,054
I THINK FIVE TIMES TO

145
00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:17,390
JONATHAN SWAN OVER AT AXIOS.

146
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,524
WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE

147
00:03:18,524 --> 00:03:20,159
WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE IT LOOKS

148
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,394
LIKE THE PRESIDENT CAN'T

149
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:23,396
EVEN TRUST HIS OWN STAFF.

150
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:25,198
>> LOOK, I CAN TELL YOU

151
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:27,166
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF BAD

152
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:27,500
ACTORS.

153
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,736
I THINK IT IS DISGUSTING AND

154
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:31,471
SOME OF THE MOST SHAMEFUL

155
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:32,638
BEHAVIOR THAT YOU COULD EVER

156
00:03:32,638 --> 00:03:32,972
ENGAGE.

157
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:34,006
IN IT'S AN HONOR AND

158
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:34,874
PRIVILEGE TO WORK FOR THE

159
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:36,342
PRESIDENT AND TO BE PART OF

160
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:37,243
HIS ADMINISTRATION.

161
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,145
ANYBODY WHO BETRAYS THAT, I

162
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:41,447
THINK IS A TOTAL AND

163
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:42,281
COMPLETE COWARD AND THEY

164
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,516
SHOULD BE FIRED.

165
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,017
WE FIRED PEOPLE OVER LEAKING

166
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:45,351
BEFORE.

167
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:46,252
I HAVE PERSONALLY FIRED

168
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:47,320
PEOPLE OVER LEAKING BEFORE.

169
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,621
AND WE CERTAINLY WOULD BE

170
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:50,957
VERY WILLING TO DO SO AGAIN.

171
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:52,558
BUT, AGAIN, THIS IS ONE OF

172
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:53,726
THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITIES

173
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,528
OF A LIFETIME TO GET TO WORK

174
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:57,196
AND SERVE FOR PRESIDENT

175
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:57,497
TRUMP.

176
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:58,731
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

177
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:00,066
SACRED FOR SOMEBODY TO ALLOW

178
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:01,901
TO YOU HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY

179
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:04,570
AND WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

180
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,905
STEVE: SARAH, WHY DO THEY DO

181
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:06,172
IT?

182
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:07,573
ARE THEY TRYING TO STAB

183
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:09,075
OTHER STAFF MEMBERS IN THE

184
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:09,375
BACK?

185
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,810
ARE THEY TRYING TO ADVANCE

186
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,744
THEIR POLITICAL AGENDA?

187
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:12,912
ARE THEY TRYING TO SET THE

188
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:14,180
RECORD STRAIGHT?

189
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,148
WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?

190
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:17,083
>> THINK THINK THERE ARE

191
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:17,817
PROBABLY A NUMBER OF

192
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:18,151
REASONS.

193
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:19,285
SOME OF THESE LEAKS ARE MADE

194
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:20,887
UP AND REPORTERS SEARCH FOR

195
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,088
VALIDATION FOR THEM.

196
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:23,589
LOOK, THERE IS DEFINITELY

197
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:25,358
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE

198
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:25,725
ADDRESSED.

199
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:27,293
WE ARE FOCUSED INTENSELY ON

200
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:27,894
ADDRESSING IT.

201
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:30,396
AND WE TAKE AN EXTREMELY

202
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:30,763
SERIOUSLY.

203
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:32,098
AS I JUST SAID, I CAN'T

204
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:34,267
ANSWER WHY PEOPLE DO IT

205
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,568
BECAUSE I FIND IT TO BE SOME

206
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,003
OF THE MOST DISGUSTING

207
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:38,271
BEHAVIOR THAT YOU COULD EVER

208
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,305
PARTICIPATE IN AND ONE OF

209
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:40,473
THE MOST DISLOYAL THINGS

210
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:45,511
THAT YOU COULD DO AS

211
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:46,412
ENTRUSTED MEMBER OF THE

212
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:46,913
PRESIDENT'S TEAM.

213
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:51,083
WE HAVE BIG THINGS HAPPENING

214
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,051
HERE DECISIONS WITH NORTH

215
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:52,351
KOREA.

216
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,352
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IRAN.

217
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:54,720
WE HAVE MOVED THE EMBASSY,

218
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,923
THE PRESIDENT IS GROWING THE

219
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:57,256
ECONOMY.

220
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,057
CREATING JOBS.

221
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:02,195
WE JUST GOT THE 21st

222
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:05,131
CIRCUIT JUDGE NOMINATED AND

223
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:06,199
CLEARED THE SENATE

224
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:06,699
YESTERDAY.

225
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:07,533
AMAZING AND BIG THINGS ARE

226
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:07,900
HAPPENING.

227
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,568
THAT'S WHAT OUR

228
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:09,302
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE

229
00:05:09,302 --> 00:05:11,037
FOCUSED ON.

230
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,238
BE FOCUSED ON.

231
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:13,406
AND WHAT WE WOULD LIKE --

232
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:14,874
THE NEWS FRANKLY TO BE

233
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:15,241
COVERING.

234
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:16,142
THERE ARE ALL THESE BIG

235
00:05:16,142 --> 00:05:16,742
THINGS HAPPENING.

236
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:17,944
THAT'S WHAT THEY SHOULD BE

237
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:19,011
COVERING AS WELL.

238
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:20,179
IT'S A COMPLETE DISSERVICE

239
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,080
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT

240
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,682
THEY SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON A

241
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:24,717
COMMENT MADE IN A PRIVATE

242
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:25,718
MEETING VERSUS THE COMMENTS

243
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:26,886
THAT ARE MADE ON A PUBLIC

244
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:29,021
STAGE THAT ARE LITERALLY

245
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:30,289
CHANGING THE COURSE OF HUMAN

246
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,524
HISTORY THAT THIS PRESIDENT

247
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:32,358
IS ENGAGED IN.

248
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:33,292
THAT IS WHAT THE MEDIA

249
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,827
SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON AND I

250
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:35,761
HOPE THEY WILL SPEND A

251
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:36,929
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME OVER

252
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:39,131
THE NEXT WEEKS LEADING UP TO

253
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,501
THE SUMMIT TO DO EXACTLY

254
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:41,868
THAT.

255
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:42,969
ABBY: DO YOU THINK WE CAN

256
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,771
EXPECT AN APOLOGY FROM THAT

257
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:47,573
AIDE, KELLY SADLER?

258
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:48,441
MEGHAN MCCAIN IS A FRIEND OF

259
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:48,741
MINE.

260
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:50,176
I KNOW THE WAY THEY LEFT IT

261
00:05:50,176 --> 00:05:51,744
THEY SPOKE ON THE PHONE AND

262
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:52,612
MEGHAN MCCAIN SAID SHE WOULD

263
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:54,046
APPRECIATE A PUBLIC APOLOGY.

264
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:55,114
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WAITING

265
00:05:55,114 --> 00:05:56,349
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

266
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:57,583
SHOULD WE NOW EXPECT THAT

267
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,184
NOT TO HAPPEN?

268
00:05:58,184 --> 00:05:59,352
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO

269
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:00,653
THE BACK AND FORTH ON THIS.

270
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,188
I THINK IT'S BEEN ADDRESSED.

271
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:03,422
WE ARE DEALING WITH THIS

272
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:04,457
MATTER INTERNALLY.

273
00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:06,859
AGAIN, I THINK WE SHOULD BE

274
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:07,793
FOCUSED -- A.

275
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:08,561
ABBY: WHY THE STRATEGY TO

276
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:10,062
NOT COME OUT PUBLICLY AND

277
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:10,963
SAY YOU KNOW WHAT?

278
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:12,131
I WAS WRONG.

279
00:06:12,131 --> 00:06:12,598
LET'S MOVE ON?

280
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:14,400
>> SHE HAS PERSONALLY

281
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,800
APOLOGIZED.

282
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,434
AGAIN, I DON'T THINK WE

283
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:17,169
SHOULD CONTINUE TO VALIDATE

284
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,504
LEAKS THAT COME OUT BY

285
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,805
MAKING THAT THE FOCUS OF

286
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:20,540
WHAT WE ARE DOING.

287
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,174
I THINK THERE ARE SOME

288
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:22,975
INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT THIS

289
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,443
PRESIDENT IS DOING THAT

290
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:25,778
LITERALLY HAS MASSIVE GLOBAL

291
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:26,245
IMPACTS.

292
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:28,347
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE

293
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,749
WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT.

294
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:30,716
BRIAN: I WOULD HAVE TROUBLE

295
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:32,752
EVEN EXPRESSING MY THOUGHTS

296
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:33,986
KNOWING THAT SOMEBODY ON MY

297
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:34,921
OWN TEAM COULD BE LEAKING

298
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,255
THAT TO THE PRESS.

299
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:37,423
DOESN'T OVERLOOK AND

300
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:38,024
OVERSHADOW ALL THE OTHER

301
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:39,191
PEOPLE THAT ARE LOYAL TO THE

302
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,126
PRESIDENT THAT WORK WITH HIM

303
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:40,826
EVERY DAY.

304
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:42,194
AND I IMAGINE YOU'RE ONE OF

305
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:42,495
THEM.

306
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:44,096
NOW, I HAVE GOT TO ASK YOU

307
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:44,730
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"

308
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,898
TODAY HAD THIS FRONT PAGE

309
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:47,066
STORY ABOUT NAFTA.

310
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,067
IN THE BACK DROP THE

311
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:49,068
PRESIDENT HAS ALWAYS SAID I

312
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:50,303
WANT TO UPDATE THIS DEAL

313
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:51,604
THAT'S OVER 20 YEARS OLD.

314
00:06:51,604 --> 00:06:54,373
WORD IS NOW IT'S GOING NOT

315
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,608
GOING TO GET DONE THIS YEAR.

316
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:56,576
WE KNOW THE SPEAKER OF THE

317
00:06:56,576 --> 00:06:57,977
HOUSE SAID IF YOU WANT THIS

318
00:06:57,977 --> 00:06:59,512
PASSED, I NEED IT BY NEXT

319
00:06:59,512 --> 00:06:59,812
WEEK.

320
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:00,713
WHAT HAPPENED?

321
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:02,448
>> WELL, LOOK, WE ARE STILL

322
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:03,649
IN ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS.

323
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:04,483
THE PRESIDENT IS COMMITTED

324
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:06,452
THOUGH TO MAKING SURE THAT

325
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:07,620
WE DO SOMETHING BETTER.

326
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,988
HE DOESN'T WANT TO JUST

327
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,022
CONTINUE ON THE STATUS QUO.

328
00:07:10,022 --> 00:07:12,792
THAT'S THE EASY THING TO DO.

329
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,493
BRIAN: IS MEXICO THE

330
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:15,528
PROBLEM, SARAH OR IS CANADA

331
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:16,329
THE PROBLEM OR BOTH?

332
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:17,830
>> LOOK, WE HAVE GOT TO GET

333
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,098
A DEAL THAT WORKS FOR

334
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:19,465
EVERYBODY.

335
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:20,533
BUT, MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS

336
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:21,500
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO MAKE

337
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,502
SURE THAT WE GET A DEAL THAT

338
00:07:23,502 --> 00:07:24,737
WORKS FOR AMERICA.

339
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:26,572
HE IS TIRED OF GETTING TAKEN

340
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,974
ADVANTAGE OF BY COUNTRY

341
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:29,008
AFTER COUNTRY WHEN IT COMES

342
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:30,309
TO TRADE AND HE IS GOING TO

343
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:31,944
MAKE SURE THAT WE GET A GOOD

344
00:07:31,944 --> 00:07:34,213
DEAL THAT HELPS PEOPLE IN

345
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:35,781
THIS COUNTRY AND THAT WE'RE

346
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:38,150
ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.

347
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,352
AND HE IS NOT GOING TO STOP

348
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:40,419
UNTIL HE GETS IT I HAVE

349
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,120
THINK YOU KNOW THIS

350
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,254
PRESIDENT IS THE TOUGHEST

351
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,222
NEGOTIATOR AT THE TABLE.

352
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:44,757
AND HE IS GOING TO MAKE SURE

353
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:46,092
HE GETS SOMETHING THAT

354
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:46,726
WORKS.

355
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:47,093
YOU.

356
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:48,127
BRIAN: USE THE OLD DEAL

357
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:50,329
UNTIL WE BET THE NEW

358
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:51,297
DEALENNED THAT'S NOT

359
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:51,764
WORKING, RIGHT?

360
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,332
>> AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT IS

361
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:55,301
WILLING TO TEAR UP THE NAFTA

362
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:56,369
AGREEMENT IF THAT'S WHAT IT

363
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:56,936
COMES TO.

364
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:57,970
WE STILL WANT TO SEE

365
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,804
SOMETHING HAPPEN AND WE'RE

366
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:00,139
GOING TO CONTINUE IN THOSE

367
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:00,573
CONVERSATIONS.

368
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:01,440
THEY ARE ONGOING NOW.

369
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,609
AND WE ARE PUSHING FORWARD

370
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,311
AND HOPEFUL WE CAN GET

371
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:06,545
SOMETHING DONE SOON.

372
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:07,179
STEVE: YOU WILL GET

373
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:07,780
SOMETHING DONE TODAY.

374
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,814
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT IS

375
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:09,749
GOING TO HOST A NUMBER OF

376
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:10,883
OFFICIALS FROM

377
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,218
ANTI-SANCTUARY CITIES AND

378
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:14,720
COUNTIES AND THINGS LIKE

379
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,021
THAT.

380
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:15,955
THIS MORNING WE HAD THE ON

381
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:21,961
THE MAYOR OF LOIS

382
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:22,228
THE MAYOR OF LOSS

383
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:22,595
THE MAYOR OF LOS ALAMITOS.

384
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:24,196
HE SAID THE MESSAGE IN THESE

385
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:26,766
TOWNS AND COUNTIES STAND UP

386
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:29,201
AGAINST SACRAMENTO WHICH

387
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:30,536
THE SANCTUARY STATE OF

388
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:32,337
CALIFORNIA IS FORGET ABOUT

389
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:33,304
THAT, WE'RE NOT THINKING

390
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,840
ABOUT THAT, WE'RE THINKING

391
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,941
ABOUT US ACTUALLY ENFORCING

392
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:37,143
THE LAWS OF THE UNITED

393
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:38,309
STATES OF AMERICA.

394
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,645
WE'RE A LAW AND ORDER TOWN.

395
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,581
>> ABSOLUTELY.

396
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:43,448
I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU

397
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:43,749
MORE.

398
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:45,017
WE HAVE TO ENFORCE THE LAWS

399
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:46,185
THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS.

400
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:47,687
PEOPLE DON'T GET TO DECIDE.

401
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:49,055
CITIES DON'T GET TO PICK AND

402
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:50,756
CHOOSE WHICH LAWS THEY WANT

403
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:51,123
TO FOLLOW.

404
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:52,358
JUST BECAUSE IT'S CALIFORNIA

405
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:54,093
DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET TO

406
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:55,494
DECIDE THAT YOU DON'T WANT

407
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:56,962
TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR

408
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:58,097
GOVERNMENT AND IN OUR

409
00:08:58,097 --> 00:08:58,564
SYSTEM.

410
00:08:58,564 --> 00:08:59,899
AND YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE

411
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,534
LAW THAT IS ON THE BOOKS.

412
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:03,402
AND WE'RE VERY THANKFUL THAT

413
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:04,837
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MAYORS

414
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,138
AND COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, ET

415
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:07,840
CETERA, THAT ARE STANDING UP

416
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,341
TO SOME OF THE OTHERS AND

417
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,676
SAYING ENOUGH IS ENOUGH LIKE

418
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,411
THIS IS NOT WHAT OUR STATE

419
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:12,712
NEEDS.

420
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:14,013
IT'S NOT WHAT OUR STATE

421
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:15,147
WANTS AND WE ARE GLAD THEY

422
00:09:15,147 --> 00:09:16,649
ARE GOING TO BE HERE AND BE

423
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:17,349
PART OF THAT DISCUSSION

424
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,851
LATER THIS AFTERNOON.

425
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:19,485
BRIAN: I'M SURE YOU KNOW

426
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:20,519
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAD A

427
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,454
BIG MEETING YESTERDAY ABOUT

428
00:09:21,454 --> 00:09:22,655
IMMIGRATION AND TRYING TO

429
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:25,958
GET DACA BACK ON THE BOOKS.

430
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,093
TRYING TO GET DEMOCRAT AND

431
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,327
REPUBLICAN SUPPORT TO TRY TO

432
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:29,528
LOOK AT DACA DEAL AGAIN.

433
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,863
WHAT COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT

434
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:31,897
THE PRESIDENT'S STANCE ON

435
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:32,698
THIS?

436
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,800
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

437
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,168
VERY CLEAR ON WHAT HE WANTS

438
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:37,903
TO SEE WHEN IT COMES TO AN

439
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:38,537
IMMIGRATION PACKAGE.

440
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,239
HE WANTS TO CLOSE THE

441
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:40,606
LOOPHOLES.

442
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:42,575
HE WANTS TO SECURE THE

443
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:43,309
BORDER.

444
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:44,243
AND HE IS WILLING TO DO

445
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:45,344
SOMETHING ON DACA BUT WE

446
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:46,846
HAVE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

447
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:47,880
WE CAN'T JUST KICK THE CAN

448
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,115
DOWN THE ROAD.

449
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:53,452
WE HAVE TO SECURE THE

450
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:53,853
BORDER.

451
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:54,520
BRIAN: REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS

452
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,221
COMING UP WITH THEIR PLAN.

453
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,021
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WHAT

454
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:56,856
THEY ARE DOING?

455
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:58,057
DOES THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT

456
00:09:58,057 --> 00:09:58,924
THESE THREE REPUBLICANS OR

457
00:09:58,924 --> 00:09:59,191
NOT?

458
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:00,292
>> LOOK, WE WILL SEE WHAT

459
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,427
THAT COMES OUT TO LOOK LIKE.

460
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:02,061
AT THE SAME TIME, THE

461
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:02,995
PRESIDENT HAS NOT WAVERED

462
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:04,663
AND HE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY

463
00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:06,298
CLEAR ON WHAT THE PRIORITIES

464
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:07,433
AND WHAT THE PRINCIPLES ARE

465
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:08,601
THAT HE WANTS TO SEE WHEN IT

466
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:10,102
COMES TO ANY PIECE OF

467
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:14,640
IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION.

468
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,442
ABBY: SARAH, HOW IS MELANIA

469
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:16,742
DOING?

470
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,110
>> SHE IS DOING VERY WELL.

471
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,712
SHE IS IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS.

472
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:21,380
THE PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO GO

473
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,648
BACK TO WALTER REED

474
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:24,250
YESTERDAY AND VISIT WITH HER

475
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,584
AND SHE ASK THAT EVERYBODY

476
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,019
CONTINUES TO KEEP HER IN

477
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:27,820
YOUR PRAYERS.

478
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,121
BUT SHE IS ONE OF THE

479
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:30,055
TOUGHEST PEOPLE YOU WILL

480
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:31,524
FIND AND SHE IS DOING GREAT

481
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:32,825
AND IN GOOD SPIRITS.

482
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:34,560
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

483
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,461
STEVE: THE PLAN IS FOR HER

484
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:36,996

486
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,364
>> YEAH.

487
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:39,899
SHE IS ON TRACK FOR THE NEXT

488
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,268
COUPLE OF DAYS AND CERTAIN

489
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:44,003
LIE WE WILL KEEP EVERYONE

490
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:44,403

00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:45,004
ABBY: OUR THOUGHTS AND

492
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:45,838
PRAYERS ARE WITH HER.

493
00:10:45,838 --> 00:10:46,539
GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS

494
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:46,872
MORNING.

495
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:47,473
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

496
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:49,275
THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.

497
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:50,409
BRIAN: SOMEONE ELSE HAS TO

498
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:51,844
BRING BARRON TO SOCCER

499
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:52,211
PRACTICE.

500
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:53,179
I HOPE YOU ARE PITCHING IN.

501
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,980
>> VERY FEW THINGS I COULD

502
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,382
PROBABLY HELP PITCH IN ON,

503
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:58,117
THAT, I THINK I COULD

504
00:10:58,117 --> 00:10:58,517
HANDLE.

505
00:10:58,517 --> 00:10:59,652
STEVE: I BET YOU HAVE A

506
00:10:59,652 --> 00:10:59,985
MINIVAN.

507
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:01,387
>> I DON'T HAVE A MINIVAN

508
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:03,355
BUT I HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM IN

509
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:05,224
