president Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani has been talking a lot this week we've been pretty horrified by it and now some Trump administration officials and other Republicans are pushing back at what he is saying as well well in Israel Giuliani stated that North Korea's Kim jong-eun begged his hands and knees for exactly the position you want to put them in Giuliani later said to NBC News that his statement was a quote metaphor here is how Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded when asked whether Giuliani's comment could jeopardize negotiations with North Korea I know Rudy really doesn't speak for the administration when it comes to this negotiation in this set of issues ya know also yesterday first lady Melania Trump pushed back at someone against these comments from Giuliani on stormy Daniels she believes in her husband she knows it's not true I don't even think there's a slight suspicion that it's true and you when you look at stormy Daniels sexual exploitation yesterday a spokesperson for the first lady said in a statement I don't believe mrs. Trump has ever discussed her thoughts on anything with mr. Giuliani well that's rather broad yeah that would that would keep it clear that they want nothing to do with his disgusting misogynistic foolish statement which we talked about enough but it's worth repeating that this guy is as bad as it gets when it comes to his views on women and he represents the president Republican senator well holds a willie willie geist it does bear repeating though about Rudy Giuliani I mean first of all look how this guy has improperly inserted himself not only in the Moller investigation saying things that are constitutionally inaccurate and only hurt the president's cause but also he's interfered with the work of the president and the national security advisor and the Secretary of State by saying some stupid comments that again they had to disassociate themselves with and he's now inserting himself into with his stupid comments the president's marriage and the first lady clearly could not have been more explicit and saying that he doesn't speak for that she's never talked to him about quote anything it bears it bears reminding viewers and I know for those of us who have spent a lot time in New York it bears reminding viewers that this is a guy who not only guided New York through 9/11 and an admirable I thought a pretty remarkable way but also as I wrote in one of my columns a column that Rudy Giuliani attack called me stupid and reminded me much of my humiliation I had never been knighted by the Queen of England said one of the great policy achievements one of the great governing achievements of the 20th century was the turnaround of New York City by Giuliani and Bill Bratton this is a guy who actually achieved great things and it's just remarkable this is he's not even a shadow of himself now yeah he's not and the the the thing we have to remember though is that he's doing this with the explicit or at least tacit endorsement of President Trump President Trump could stop this anytime he could call Rudy Giuliani and say knock it off he could pull him off TV you could say Rudy Giuliani doesn't speak for me anymore for all of our criticisms of the Trump administration and the warranted criticisms there are serious people trying to do serious things and Mike Pompeo was one of them he's been at the forefront of setting up this summit trying to denuclearize North Korea and to have Rudy Giuliani freelancing on a trip in tel-aviv and undercutting all the work that serious people are doing it's not only bad for President Trump it's bad for the country but as I said President Trump could stop it he likes this he likes that the rat is being stirred and I know you talked to Rudy yesterday Jonathan a lot of people have noted and Donny could speak to this too that Rudy Giuliani is just happy to be back on the stage that he's on shows like this that we're talking about him that he's on TV all the time that he's back in the middle of the conversation right and there's a difference between what Rudy Gianni is supposed to be doing and what he's actually doing and an argument can be made that his mission being out there is the president's legal attack dog this rep√∫blica face of his defense team is being somewhat effective the president wanted him to go out there and muddy the waters right undermine the credibility of those investigating Donald Trump whether that's James Comey or Robert or Robert Muller that he is out there moving and the goal posts of this investigation making declarations like oh the Special Counsel says this will wrap up by September 1st or the interview if it happens will be limited in size and scope robert muller hasn't said those things right Giuliani has sort of seized upon that idea but there's a vacuum that he can fill but he's playing the public relations game trying to influence the public and lawmakers about this probe but he keeps getting himself in trouble with comments like this about the first lady or about the North Korean negotiations and yes and our reporting the President to this point is still okay with Giuliani being out there but patience is wearing really thin elsewhere in the West Lane well but you know Donnie you know PR very very well if you keep making claims when you're running GM's account if you said hey listen get in this car is fantastic not only are you gonna get 36 miles to the gallon but you press a button and the car flies you can fly over traffic you don't have to worry about the hunch or the merit you can just fly right on and then the CEO has to come okay well you know that's not really true and then you make about ten different statements like that you know there's this Chevy car you get in the car it's a fantastic car you know what it can take turns at 45 miles an hour states low to the ground also it reverses male pattern baldness the CEO would have to come out so we'll know actually you might need to get you some Rogaine but this car it won't it it will like make that turn but there's some things it just doesn't I mean at some point Donnie you become Baghdad Bob at some point people tune you out at some point you actually start hurting more than Alvin cuz all of his claims don't scare robert muller robert muller looks at him and just says what we say my god think what this guy used to be and now he's just a clown i'm not saying that i'm sure that Muller's team is saying that but they've got to be looking at this guy going what has happened to Rudy he's turned himself into such a clown a dangerous clown and a pathetic clown and a piggish clown in the last five days as Joey's you hinted just beyond just even Trump but what has come out of Giuliana's mouth five days is a lie about Kim Jong as far as him being on his Hannity so really putting that you know summit at risk basically in the most disgusting vile way talking about storming downs that she doesn't rate as a woman because she chose a certain way to make her living you know how dare you you pathetic misogynistic ugly man also commenting on her looks I love Donald Trump the routing the arbiter of what is physically attractive I mean when you look at those target you kidding me I've gone off on the show about Trump's look we Johnny is actually difficult to look out and then finally his comment about that the president can pardon himself and even if he's a shoot smaller yeah I'm disgusting reprehensible the interesting thing is the reason the CEO obviously doesn't come down on his mouthpiece is because we know the CEO is actually the gold medalist versus the silver medalist at lying and what's so interesting you guys thinking you determine advertising and PR that if I was doing ads for Count Chocula I would have to go through so much more of a intense process of what I can and can't say oh no you can't say that it's got nine percent chocolate if it's only got eight percent chocolate versus on a daily basis basically other than what people do on shows like this the Julie ayan Trump can continue to go out there with actually no accountability it's stunning to your point though about Muller at the end of the day none of this is gonna matter in court and it is gonna matter come this November election because I do believe although we see that 40 percent holding strong that the American people are gonna stand up and that's when the game is going to change also lose the second yeah I also think though what's incredibly disturbing and and Susan you worked with him okay I want to get you and caddy in here is that if if a company was negotiating a huge merger with another company and one of the vice presidents or somebody in the company was like trolling the other company and getting in the way of the negotiations that person would be fired the the board would step up every in the company the CEO its up would get rid of the person who's creating trouble only if that person went the CEO was was upset with what that person was saying that it's the rub here is that Donald Trump is very happy I think no I'm actually making the point though that and I want to hear about where Rudy what has happened to Rudy Giuliani's personality that makes him capable of being so disgusting and so openly vile and putrid as it pertains to women with seemingly no care in the world about it about what he's saying but also being able to interfere in some of the most critical foreign policy issues of our time and not have president Trump's entire staff of generals chief of staff Mike Pompeo mattis bolton said this guy has to go we can't do our work this guy has to go you need to get off your phone this guy has to go what is it that President Trump has the ability to protect stupidity in the White House to the point where we become an international joke and literally this is the the pillars of our country are breaking down because nobody has any right to say anything to this president well what's amazing is with everything you highlighted the thing that probably is upsetting the president from what I hear the most is that he got involved in his marriage that he made the comments about Melania that's what's really causing a problem within the White House right now with the president by the way Melania Trump pushing back at what he's saying that she believes her husband so let's make that clear we are not sure she believes her husband not that we want and eat well know anything about and the fact that she made a statement says a lot he make million ton amount like that and this is not I'm not making any excuse but the fact is is that the mayor ran the city for eight years he's been in his own business he now is he like that no no I mean I would love to see the old Rudy as I've said before I don't recognize what her make of this change but I think that he is used to calling the shots he likes being in the spotlight again and he's not used to answering to somebody else he this is what Rudy would do a year ago five years ago when he would go out there he would just speak he's not recognizing that how his how he's representing not only his client but the United States he did this overseas let's not forget that so he he needs to realize that there's a more of an accountability process here than he's used to and I think that's a big reason why he's starting to get in trouble now because he's forgetting that he's speaking to the president a lot he feels like he's in you know the boys club having fun again this is actually fun for him the boys cleaned that's what he well it is the Boy Scout because Joe yeah caddy so there are obviously serious ramifications to what not only the president does but also what Rudy Guiliani does today the g7 summit meeting and there is actually talk and I I'm sure a lot of observers would not blame Matt chrome and the rest of the leaders there if they drafted a communique for the g6 and not the g7 because for the first time since these these countries and these leaders started getting together you have one country that is moving in these the opposite direction historically is the other six yeah you know the summit attack this time a year ago was not great the tensions were there in Sicily when they met but they did manage all seven of them to come up with a joint communique speaking to foreign diplomats going into this summit they've never known relations between the world's biggest liberal democracies be this bad and there is a very real prospect that the world these other six members have now decided particularly the Europeans look we've spent a year and a half trying to figure out how to deal with the United States we feel that we've acquiesced on things we feel we've tried to play nice with Donald Trump and time and again we've been rebuffed we were buffed over Paris we were rebuffed over Iran we were rebuffed over the embassy moving to Jerusalem and now we're getting slapped with trade tariffs and as president macro of France put it you know very clearly yesterday our soldiers are fighting alongside American soldiers in Syria they're fighting alongside American soldiers in Iraq French soldiers and Allied soldiers are fighting alongside American soldiers in Africa trying to wait wipe out extremism trying to defend Western democracy at the moment against the onslaught of Islamic extremism and what does the president do he slaps his closest allies with tariffs like this and talks about them in a way that we just find unsustainable when they see says this is a national security issue where's the national security issue the national security issue is to keep your allies on board so that you can fight threats around the world that is the issue of national security it's not slapping tariffs of 25 percent on imports of steel and aluminium you talk about those things you try to negotiate them and I think you know we are this summit in Quebec is going to be very frosty and I think you're starting to see Europeans say we have to find a different way to deal with this president yeah and Willy we've been talking about what would happen if CEOs had a spokesperson that it said in temperent insulting things about others the CEO mica mica said I mean the CEO would call a man that fire him we don't see that happening with the president the United States here with Rudy Giuliani but you know let's take it down to the most basic level and the one thing that I must admit I don't understand with a lot of people who worship Donald Trump and have children this is a sort of behavior that we would not even tolerate with children I'd see there's a little league when when when we're playing baseball and you know you hear all the coaches in the league if players start shouting at the pitcher while they're in the dugout because it's say hey you know look at the batter don't don't attack the pitch I mean we teach our children every day to live by certain standards to be respectful to work hard I mean you've got those examples whether it's Rudy Giuliani or Donald Trump saying oh no he's not going to study for the most important nuclear summit since 1988 it seems that this administration undermines the most basic values that we try to teach our children they're 5 and 6 years old well as you know Joe the president's not thinking about values or being a role model he doesn't have a grand vision of the presidency or the Khan or history he's thinking about his own survival and I'll borrow again the Chris Matthews term the fog machine he has really Juliana their spring fog saying that the president can pardon himself that this investigation is unconstitutional whatever he can put out there to undermine whatever Bob Muller comes out with whatever he finds whenever he does Donald Trump likes that for his own survival not for the country not to be a role model to our children whatever it takes to survive thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories
