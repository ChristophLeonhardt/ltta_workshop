9
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,354
HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN TRYING

10
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:11,156
TO QUIET THE REBILLING WITHIN

11
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:12,657
THE RANKS, GROWING NUMBER OF

12
00:00:12,657 --> 00:00:13,391
MODERATE REMOVAL OF THE TRYING

13
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:15,227
TO FORCE A VOTE ON FOUR

14
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:16,193
DIFFERENT IMMIGRATION MEASURES

15
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:17,896
THINK IT'S TIME TO SETTLE THE

16
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:19,731
DACA ISSUE.

17
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:22,100
CONGRESSMAN JEFF DENHAM SAYS

18
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,935
IT'S -- HE IS LEADING THE CHARGE

19
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:25,704
TO FORCE BRYAN'S HAND THAT WOULD

20
00:00:25,704 --> 00:00:27,672
GIVE DREAMERS A PATHWAY TO LEGAL

21
00:00:27,672 --> 00:00:28,006
STATUS.

22
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:30,809
>> IT'S A 12 YEAR PROCESS.

23
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,811
I BELIEVE THE EARNED PATHWAY,

24
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:33,945
THE EARNED PROCESS, WOULD PUT

25
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:35,413
YOU AT THE BACK OF THE LINE BUT

26
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:36,915
CERTAINLY SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN

27
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:38,416
HERE WHO'S GRADUATED FROM OUR

28
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,685

00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:43,388
COMMUNITY THAT HAS FOLLOWED THE

30
00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:45,323
EXECUTIVE ORDER UNDER OBAMA

31
00:00:45,323 --> 00:00:47,425
SHOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY.

32
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:48,126
>> Shannon: JEFF DENHAM HAS

33
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:52,597
THE SUPPORT OF MINORITY LEADER

34
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:53,932
DEMOCRAT NANCY PELOSI.

35
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:55,233
G.O.P. LEADERS ARE SOUNDING THE

36
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:56,301
ALARM SAYING THAT MOVING FORWARD

37
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:58,803
COULD HURT REPUBLICANS IN THE

38
00:00:58,803 --> 00:00:59,237
FALL ELECTION.

39
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:00,238
JIM JORDAN IS A REPUBLICAN FROM

40
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:01,806
OHIO AND MEMBER OF THE

41
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:02,440

TONIGHT.

45
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:06,444
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

46
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:07,846
THE FARM BILL IS A HUGE DEAL.

47
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:09,648
YOU GUYS ARE SAYING I'M A

48
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:10,715
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, YOU

49
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:12,484
DON'T WANT TO VOTE ON THAT UNTIL

50
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:13,151
YOU GET A VOTE ON SOMETHING

51
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:15,153
RELATED TO IMMIGRATION WHICH IS

52
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:17,122
THAT THE CHAIRMAN GOODLETT BILL.

53
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:19,224
IS THERE GOING TO BE A VOTE ON

54
00:01:19,224 --> 00:01:20,592
THE FARM BILL TOMORROW?

55
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:21,826
>> WE WILL SEE.

56
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:23,828
A COUPLE THINGS TO START, THE

57
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:24,763
GOODLATTE BILL IS THE BILL

58
00:01:24,763 --> 00:01:25,830
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE

59
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,899
MANDATE OF THE 2016 ELECTION ON

60
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:28,300
IMMIGRATION.

61
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,434
IT DOES THINGS IN THE RIGHT

62
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:30,235
ORDER.

63
00:01:30,235 --> 00:01:31,836
IT SAYS BUILD THE BORDER SECURED

64
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:32,804
A WALL.

65
00:01:32,804 --> 00:01:36,741
END CHAIN MIGRATION, STOP -- ALL

66
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:37,609
THE WAY DOWN THE LIST.

67
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:39,978
AND THEN IT SAYS AFTER REDO IT,

68
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:45,116
WE WILL DO IT THE DACA

69
00:01:45,116 --> 00:01:45,483
SITUATION.

70
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:48,119
THE CONCERN AND I HAVE WITH WHAT

71
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:48,920
MR. DENHAM IS DOING IS THAT IT'S

72
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,522
FINE TO USE THE RULES ANYWAY YOU

73
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:51,223
CAN TO GET SOMETHING DONE BUT

74
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:53,225
THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE

75
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:55,560
RULES I THINK TO ACCOMPLISH A

76
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,294
GOAL THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH

77
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:58,263
THE MANDATE OF THE ELECTION, NOT

78
00:01:58,263 --> 00:01:58,997
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE

79
00:01:58,997 --> 00:01:59,864
TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WE ARE

80
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:00,298
GOING TO DO.

81
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:02,033
THAT'S OUR PROBLEM.

82
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:04,436
AND WE HAVE KIND OF LINK TO DO

83
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:06,238
THE FARM BILL BECAUSE THIS IS AN

84
00:02:06,238 --> 00:02:06,938
IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION

85
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:08,006
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET

86
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:09,941
THE RIGHT THING DONE ON

87
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:11,676
IMMIGRATION AS WELL.

88
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:12,310
>> Shannon: HOUSE MAJORITY

HIM WE ARE GOING TO GIVE THEM A

92
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,615
VOTE ON GOODLATTE'S SO I DON'T

93
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:18,016
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTY.

94
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:19,651
>> IT IS ONE THING TO BE TOLD

95
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:20,218
SOMETHING.

96
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:21,052
IT'S ANOTHER THING FOR IT TO

97
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:21,620
HAPPEN.

98
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,520
RIGHT NOW THE DEMOCRATS AREN'T

99
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,055
VOTING FOR THE FARM BILL AND WE

100
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:25,657
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS

101
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:28,126
SOMETHING WE CAN TIE INTO THIS

102
00:02:28,126 --> 00:02:29,461
IMMIGRATION DEBATE TO ACCOMPLISH

103
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:30,862
WHAT WE TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

104
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:32,430
WE WERE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH ON

105
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,465
IMMIGRATION.

106
00:02:33,465 --> 00:02:34,899
I LIKE THE WELFARE REFORM IN THE

107
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:36,468
FARM BILL, FOOD STAMP REFORM, I

108
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:38,069
THINK IT'S NEEDED, THE WORK

109
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:38,503
REQUIREMENTS.

110
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:39,704
I LIKE THAT BUT I ALSO WANT TO

111
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:40,305
GET IMMIGRATION RIGHTS.

112
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:43,708
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A GROUP OF

113
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,909
COLLEAGUES, WELL-INTENTIONED

114
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:46,544
MEMBERS WHO ARE PUSHING

115
00:02:46,544 --> 00:02:47,412
SOMETHING DIFFERENT, THAT IS NOT

116
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:48,613
CONSISTENT WITH THE MANDATE OF

117
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:49,047
THE ELECTION.

118
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:50,215

WE MAKE THIS JOB WAY TOO HARD.

124
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:56,454
IT.

125
00:02:56,454 --> 00:02:56,821
SIMPLE.

126
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:58,223
WHAT DO WE TELL THE VOTERS WE

127
00:02:58,223 --> 00:02:59,257
ARE GOING TO DO?

128
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:00,625
WE DIDN'T TELL THEM WE'RE GOING

129
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,360
TO DO SOME KIND OF >> BILL ALONE

130
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,829
WHICH WILL BE THE RESULT OF WHAT

131
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,264
THEY ARE PUT TOGETHER ON

THAT, THE JUDGE SAYS I WANT TO

191
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:30,849
SEE IT AND HE GOT TO SEE TODAY.

192
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:32,250
HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE.

193
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,219
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT

194
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:37,288

195
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:38,590
ENTIRE PERIMETER THAN FRAMEWORK

199
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:46,030
IN THE INITIAL SCOPE WAS ONE

200
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,234

AND ALL WE HAVE GOT TO SEE IS A

206
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:58,443
LITTLE BIT OF THAT THAT DEALT

207
00:04:58,443 --> 00:04:58,977

NEED TO SEE IT BECAUSE THEY ARE

214
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,420
THE ONES WHO ELECTED THIS

215
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,220
