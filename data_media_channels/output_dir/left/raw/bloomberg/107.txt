1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,920
Cities are concrete, glass and steel - they
look and act un-naturally -

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,480
absorbing heat and repelling water.

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,680
Our urban spaces are at odds with the natural
environment.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,149
But, in parts of the German capital things
are different.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,720
To deal with rainwater and heat, Berlin is
being transformed into what’s called a Sponge City

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,570
Carlo Becker is the architect of Berlin’s
Sponge City strategy… which harnesses rainwater

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,120
and manages heat.

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,160
In a natural ecosystem, rainwater is soaked
up by soil and vegetation,

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,920
the majority then evaporates and the rest
filters deeper into the ground.

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,400
The evaporating water then cools the surroundings.

11
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,200
Cities disrupt this system.

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,740
Water can’t soak through the concrete and
is piped away.

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,900
The Sponge City strategy aims to keep rainwater
where it lands, to imitate the natural water cycle.

14
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,060
Buildings are covered in green roofs and facades.

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,020
And down on street-level, urban wetlands and road-side
trenches - known as Swales -

16
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,540
filter run-off and hold water, keeping the
city cool by imitating nature.

17
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,119
This is Rummelsburg, in East Berlin.

18
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,490
Built 20 years ago, it’s become a large
scale example of the Sponge City concept.

19
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,640
On top we have extensive green roof of approximately
6 to 8 cm

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,359
and from there the water flows into these
courtyards here in the middle,

21
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,679
and underneath there is a garage.

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,880
On top of the underground garage we have a
soil layer of almost 80 cm.

23
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,200
It’s like a sponge and it soaks the water
during heavy rainfall

24
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,840
and then it's used by the plants...

25
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,100
so they take all the water and finally evaporate it.

26
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,000
Heiko Sieker is the brains behind the neighborhood’s
innovative management of stormwater.

27
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:36,740
In the whole area here we have no storm sewer
system, so no conventional pipe system.

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,300
The water flows from the road surface into
the swale and from here

29
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,819
it’s infiltrating into the ground.

30
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,599
On hot summer days, you can really feel the
coolness here, it’s much cooler compared

31
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,400
to other parts of the city because of the
evaporation.

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,360
You can say it’s natural air-conditioning.

33
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,620
Rummelsburg is just one example of a
Sponge City -

34
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,280
neighbourhoods across Berlin have implemented
similar initiatives.

35
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,800
But Berlin isn't a perfect Sponge City.

36
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,760
In the middle of summer 2017 the heaviest
rain in the century hit the city

37
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,960
submerging parts under water

38
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,480
and warning how much work there's still to do.

39
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,200
In fact, the city council has recently decided
all new developments should manage stormwater

40
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,200
on site, in the spirit of the Sponge City.

41
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,240
Climate Change is forcing Berlin and many
other cities around the world

42
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
to adapt urban environments...

43
00:03:56,080 --> 00:00:00,000
transforming them to work with nature, 
not against it.
