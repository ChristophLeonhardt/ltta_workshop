1
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:14,826
HOWIE: ROB REINER IS AN

2
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:18,630
UNABASHED HOLLYWOOD LIBERAL WHO

3
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,498
USES HARSH LANGUAGE ABOUT THE

4
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:21,900
PRESIDENT.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,802
WE SAT DOWN TO TALK ABOUT THAT

6
00:00:23,802 --> 00:00:35,981
AND HIS NEW FILM "SHOCK AND YOUD

7
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:36,548
AWE."

8
00:00:36,548 --> 00:00:38,750
ROBERT DE NIRO GOES ON THE TONY

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,653
AWARD STAGE AND SAYS F TRUMP AND

10
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:43,355
GETS A STANDING OVATION.

11
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:46,191
CAN YOU SEE WHERE THIS WOULD BE

12
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:49,494
OFFENSIVE TO THE 40% WHO SUPPORT

13
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:50,562
THE PRESIDENT?

14
00:00:50,562 --> 00:00:54,266
>> YES, AND I CAN SEE HOW IT’S

15
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:56,502
OFFENSIVE TO THE 40% WHO DON’T

16
00:00:56,502 --> 00:00:57,703
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT.

17
00:00:57,703 --> 00:00:59,071
I DON’T THINK THAT’S

18
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:00,272
PARTICULARLY HELPFUL FOR THOSE

19
00:01:00,272 --> 00:01:02,474
OF US WHO DON’T WANT TO SEE

20
00:01:02,474 --> 00:01:03,942
TRUMP IN OFFICE AND DON’T WANT

21
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:06,445
TO SEE HIM CONTINUE TO BE IN

22
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:06,779
OFFICE.

23
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:08,981
HOWIE: YOU TWEETED WHEN AN

24
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:11,917
AMERICAN PRESIDENT ATTACKS OUR

25
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:16,255
CLOSEST ALLIES AND EMBRACES

26
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,791
ENEMY POWERS, HE’S IN A

27
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,726
CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT TREASON.

28
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:24,997
>> I DON’T SAY HE IS, I SAID ONE

29
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:26,699
CAN ONLY CONCLUDE.

30
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:28,200
AND THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,703
HOWIE: THAT’S A FINE

32
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:31,103
DISTINCTION.

33
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:33,472
>> I DON’T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

34
00:01:33,472 --> 00:01:35,475
HE COMMITTED TREASON.

35
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:37,343
THAT WILL BE SOMETHING WE

36
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:40,746
DISCOVER OR DON’T DISCOVER AS

37
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:42,515
MUELLER’S INVESTIGATION WHICH

38
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:44,617
UNFORTUNATELY THE HOUSE AND

39
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:46,719
SENATE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT

40
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,587
MOVING ALONG.

41
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,589
SO WE’LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT

42
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:50,390
HAPPENS.

43
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,860
HOWIE: YOU DON’T SEE THAT AS AN

44
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,328
OVERLY INFLAMMATORY WORD TO USE

45
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:56,262
AGAINST A PRESIDENT?

46
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:58,765
>> IT IS A VERY INFLAMMATORY

47
00:01:58,765 --> 00:01:59,332
WORD.

48
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:01,968
BUT IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE --

49
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:03,636
LET’S PUT IT THIS WAY.

50
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:04,304
IF.

51
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:05,772
LET’S PUT IT THIS WAY.

52
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:08,074
FROM WHAT I SEE RIGHT NOW, THERE

53
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:11,044
IS A LOT OF BLANKS THAT NEED TO

54
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:12,712
BE FILLED IN FOR SURE.

55
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:14,781
HOWIE: AFTER THE ELECTION YOU

56
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,616
CALLED THE OUTCOME THE GREATEST

57
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:19,719
ATTACK ON THIS DEMOCRACY SINCE

58
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,020
1941.

59
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,190
YOU ARE COMPARING THE LAWFUL

60
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,126
ELECTION OF A CANDIDATE THROUGH

61
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:28,962
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE TO THE

62
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:31,331
ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR.

63
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:33,667
>> I NOT ONLY AGREE WITH THAT,

64
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,469
BUT I WOULD GO EVEN FURTHER.

65
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:38,038
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE

66
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:42,009
START LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED

67
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:43,777
TO AMERICA, PEOPLE HAVE TO

68
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:44,578
UNDERSTAND THIS.

69
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,413
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST OF

70
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:50,317
DIFFICULT PARTS OF UNDERSTANDING

71
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:50,751
THE RUSSIANS.

72
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:54,188
HOWIE: WE HAD AN ELECTION.

73
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:56,757
YOU ARE COMPARING IT TO 2,000

74
00:02:56,757 --> 00:02:58,959
AMERICANS BEING KILLED AT PEARL

75
00:02:58,959 --> 00:02:59,293
HARBOR.

76
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:01,195
>> I’M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT.

77
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:03,297
WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT, IT’S

78
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:04,432
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS.

79
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:06,333
THIS IS THE KEY TO US HERE.

80
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,337
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A FOREIGN

81
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:12,106
ENEMY POWER INFLUENCING AN

82
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:13,107
ELECTION.

83
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:17,545
IN THE WORLD OF CYBER WARFARE,

84
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:19,614
IT IS INSIDIOUS.

85
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:21,048
AND WE DON’T NECESSARILY FEEL

86
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:22,150
IT.

87
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,718
WE DO KNOW THE CAPACITY.

88
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:26,154
WE ARE LEARNING THE CAPACITY.

89
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:28,156
NOT JUST FROM A DISINFORMATION

90
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:30,592
CAMPAIGN AND ACTIVE MEASURES.

91
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:32,393
THE SOVIETS AND RUSSIANS HAVE

92
00:03:32,393 --> 00:03:39,868
BEEN DOING IT FOREVER.

93
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:43,638
HOWIE: LET’S TALK ABOUT THE

94
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:45,874
PRESS.

95
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:48,543
YOU CALL IT STATE-RUN MEDIA.

96
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:52,781
I PRESUME YOU KNOW FOX HAS A

97
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:55,784
THRIVING NEWS DIVISION WITH

98
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:58,386
CHRIS WALLACE AND BRET BAIER.

99
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:01,490
>> I ALSO TWEETED OUT ABOUT

100
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,492
SHEPARD SMITH AND BY THE WAY, I

101
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:06,161
HAVE MET SHEPARD SMITH AND HE IS

102
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:06,728
REPORTING THE NEWS.

103
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:08,397
THERE IS NO QUESTION BY THE.

104
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:11,133
HE’S TELLING THE TRUTH.

105
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,135
AND SO IS CHRIS WALLACE.

106
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:15,070
I HAVEN’T SEEN AS MUCH OF BRET

107
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,437
BAIER.

108
00:04:15,437 --> 00:04:17,305
AND I KNOW THERE IS A DIFFERENCE

109
00:04:17,305 --> 00:04:20,642
BETWEEN A NEWS REPORTING AND

110
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:22,711
OPINION AND EDITORIAL AND ALL OF

111
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:23,512
THAT.

112
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:26,682
BUT WHAT I’M SAYING IS THE

113
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:28,717
EDITORIAL PART OF FOX NEWS WHICH

114
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:33,122
IS, YOU KNOW, HANNITY, AND

115
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:35,758
TUCKER CARLSON, AND LAURA

116
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:36,425
INGRAHAM.

117
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:40,029
THOSE SHOWS NOT -- THEY ARE

118
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,499
REALLY IN SUPPORT OF TRUMP.

119
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:47,503
AND THAT IS -- FOX NEWS HAS A

120
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:50,506
GOOD ARRAY -- HAS STRONG

121
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:50,840
RATINGS.

122
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,377
THERE IS A CHUNK OF MEDIA THAT

123
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,880
IS VERBALLY AND OVERTLY IN

124
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,849
SUPPORT OF DONALD TRUMP.

125
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,018
THAT’S JUST TRUE.

126
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:05,922
HOWIE: THERE WAS A CHUNK OF

127
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:07,991
MEDIA THAT WAS IN SUPPORT OF

128
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:09,459
BARACK OBAMA.

129
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,595
LET’S TALK ABOUT THE RUNUP TO

130
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:13,663
THE IRAQ WAR.

131
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:17,700
YOU ARE PLAYING JOHN WOLCOTT.

132
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,469
AN OLD COLLEAGUE OF MINE.

133
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:26,610
IN TERMS OF NAME I.D., WOULD YOU

134
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,045
THINK TOM HANKS WAS WOULD HAVE

135
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:30,380
AN EASIER TIME.

136
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,149
>> ALEC BALDWIN WAS SET TO PLAY

137
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:33,917
THAT PART.

138
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,521
WE HAD BEEN SHOOTING FOR A WEEK

139
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:39,256
AND ON THE SATURDAY BEFORE HE

140
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,192
WAS SUPPOSED TO SHOOT ON MONDAY

141
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:43,093
HE CALLED AND DROPPED OUT.

142
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,329
I SAID WHAT DO I DO?

143
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:48,465
MY WIFE MICHELLE SUGGESTED I

144
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:50,367
PLAY THE PART.

145
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:53,537
I THOUGHT I DON’T KNOW, I DON’T

146
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:54,805
LIKE DIRECTING AND ACTING.

147
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:56,974
I SAID I’M AVAILABLE SO I WILL

148
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:58,208
DO IT.

149
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,944
THE ONE BIT OF DIRECTION I GOT,

150
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,648
SHE SAID TRY TO BE LESS JEWISH.

151
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:08,819
I THOUGHT -- I DON’T KNOW, I’M

152
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:16,001
HOWIE: MORE NOW WITH ROB REINER

153
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,570
AS WE TURN TO HIS FILM ABOUT THE

154
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,172
PRESS, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION

155
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,974
AND THE PRESS.

156
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:25,644
YOU SAY THE MEDIA WEREN’T TOUGH

157
00:06:25,644 --> 00:06:30,049
ENOUGH AND NONEXISTENT.

158
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:34,086
IN ONE SCENE YOU PLAYING WOLCOTT

159
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:35,087
CALL THE.

160
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:36,722
INQUIRER AND COMPLAIN THEY ARE

161
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:38,591
NOT RUNNING YOUR STORIES.

162
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,493
>> THAT WAS THE CASE.

163
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:45,598
THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

164
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:48,234
KNIGHT RIDDER NEWS SERVICE WAS

165
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:51,504
SUPPLIED TO A NUMBER OF

166
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:54,307
NEWSPAPERS AROUND THE COUNTRY.

167
00:06:54,307 --> 00:06:56,309
THEY WERE SUPPLIED BY A LOT OF

168
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:57,543
MILITARY BASES.

169
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,612
MY CHARACTER SAYS WE DON’T WRITE

170
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:02,248
FOR PEOPLE WHO SEND OTHER

171
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:03,983
PEOPLE’S KIDS TO WAR.

172
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:07,854
WE WRITE FOR PEOPLE WHOSE KIDS

173
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:11,090
GET SENT TO WAR.

174
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,993
WE WERE CONCERNED THE KNIGHT

175
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:15,328
RIDDER STORIES WERE NOT GETTING

176
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:15,862
OUT.

177
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:18,898
MANY OF THESE PAPERS DID NOT

178
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:19,899
PRINT.

179
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,000
THEY DIDN’T PRINT THEM.

180
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,203
HOWIE: WERE THEY NOT GETTING A

181
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:27,240
LOT OF PICKUP BECAUSE OF THE

182
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,677
MINDSET IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA?

183
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:33,947
BOB WOOD WARD TOLD ME AFTERWARDS

184
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:36,550
HE WAS PART OF THE MIND THINK.

185
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,719
>> WE WERE SWEPT UP IN

186
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:40,921
PATRIOTISM, 9/11.

187
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:43,857
AND PEOPLE WENT WITH THE GROUP

188
00:07:43,857 --> 00:07:44,858
THINK.

189
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:46,960
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IN A

190
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,162
SMART WAY FROM THEIR STANDPOINT,

191
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:51,898
THEY NEVER RESPONDED TO THESE

192
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:53,000
ARTICLES.

193
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,768
THEY GAVE THEM NO OXYGEN.

194
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:56,770
THEY DIDN’T REBUKE THEM OR TALK

195
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,537
ABOUT THEM.

196
00:07:57,537 --> 00:08:00,073
SO IT NEVER GOT ANY ATTENTION.

197
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:03,410
HOWIE: THE UNDERLYING ATTENTION,

198
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,079
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS

199
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,280
LYING ABOUT IRAQ.

200
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,183
BUT THAT AS OPPOSED TO CHERRY

201
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:10,617
PICKING INTELLIGENCE AS OPPOSED

202
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:13,187
TO NOT BEING SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE

203
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:14,154
INTELLIGENCE.

204
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:16,123
EVEN JOHN WOLCOTT TO THIS DAY

205
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:18,559
SAYS HE DOESN’T KNOW PEOPLE ARE

206
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:18,859
LYING.

207
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:20,895
>> WE ARE SAYING CHENEY LIED.

208
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:22,930
WE ARE SAYING CHENEY LIED AT

209
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,366
THIS ONE THING ABOUT THE IDEA IN

210
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:28,235
GENERAL BECAUSE HE HAD -- HE

211
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:33,674
TALKED ABOUT A CONNECTION

212
00:08:33,674 --> 00:08:36,077
BETWEEN MOHAMMAD ATTA AND IRAQIN

213
00:08:36,077 --> 00:08:39,246
TELL JONES WHICH DIDN’T EXIST.

214
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:40,313
THEY TALKED ABOUT THEM BEING ON

215
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:43,751
THE VERNAL OF GETTING A NUCLEAR

216
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:44,385
WEAPON.

217
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:46,554
HOWIE: ONE THING THAT TURNED OUT

218
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:49,090
TO BE UNTRUE AS TERRIBLE AS IT

219
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,760
IS IS NOT THE SAME AS LYING AND

220
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,263
DELIBERATELY PEDDLING

221
00:08:55,263 --> 00:08:55,663
FALSEHOODS.

222
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:57,565
>> THAT’S TRUE.

223
00:08:57,565 --> 00:09:01,569
BUT IF YOU KNOW YOU MADE THE

224
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:03,471
ASSUMPTION YOU WANT TO GO TO WAR

225
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:06,341
AND YOU ARE CRAFTING BITS AND

226
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:08,009
PIECES OF INTELLIGENCE TO MAKE

227
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:13,515
THAT CASE, AND IGNORING THE VAST

228
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:15,250
AMOUNT OF INTELLIGENCE.

229
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,322
BECAUSE WE HAVEN’T BEEN INSIDE

230
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:24,159
IRAQ WITH WEAPONS INSPECTORS IN

231
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:24,893
FOUR YEARS.

232
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:30,098
HOWIE: IN FAIRNESS --

233
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:32,534
>> HE GOT A LOT OF NEGATIVE

234
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:33,869
COVERAGE IN NOISE QUESTION ABOUT

235
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:34,436
IT.

236
00:09:34,436 --> 00:09:38,440
BUT I DON’T THINK DURING THE

237
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,975
PRIMARY SEASON AND EVEN DURING

238
00:09:39,975 --> 00:09:42,744
THE GENERAL HE GOT THE KIND

239
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:44,713
OF -- THERE IS ONE THING TO SAY

240
00:09:44,713 --> 00:09:46,181
NEGATIVE COVERAGE AND ONE THING

241
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:48,384
TO SAY DUE DILIGENCE AND

242
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:49,151
SCRUTINY.

243
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:50,152
REAL SCRUTINY.

244
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:52,855
I DON’T THINK HE GOT THAT.

245
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:56,792
HOWIE: YOU HAD A CIVIL DEBATE

246
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:57,459
WITH ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI.

247
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:00,429
ARE YOU GOING TO DO AN ODD

248
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:01,263
COUPLE SHOW?

249
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:03,799
>> I DIDN’T KNOW.

250
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,668
THEY SAID SCARAMUCCI I DIDN’T

251
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:07,436
KNOW HE WAS GOING TO BE THERE.

252
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:13,909
ARE WE GOING TO DO A SHOW LIKE

253
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:14,577
CROSSFIRE?

254
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:16,545
NO, I DON’T THINK SO.

255
00:10:16,545 --> 00:00:00,000
HOWIE: YOU ARE GIVING IT A
