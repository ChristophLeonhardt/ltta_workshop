9:11 is a good example of how vulnerable we are I'm Timothy Snyder and the Eleven professor of history at Yale University and most recently I wrote a book called on tyranny aspiring tyrants use real provoked or faked terrorism as an excuse to declare some kind of state of emergency a state of emergency meaning we lose our basic rights and then that temporary situation becomes permanent we get used to it it becomes the everyday this is basically page one of the playbook of modern tyranny so it's it's naive it's really foolish of us to forget about this because the tyrants the aspiring tyrant certainly know about it so 9/11 a massive terrorist attack mainly against this city led us to give up a good deal of our rights it also led us to invade a country which was completely irrelevant to the terrorist action with enormous consequences financial moral political for us so 9/11 in retrospect is a kind of warning of the mistake that we can make it could be much worse than ina leaven I mean not just the terrorist attack could be worse sadly that's true but the reaction of our leaders could also be worse whatever one might say about bushing company and I said as many bad things as I could at the time whatever one might say they didn't use it as an excuse to say that all Muslims were to blame they didn't say we have to suspend all of our civil rights due process and so on I'm afraid that the people we now have in power have fewer restraints then then that crew so 9/11 is a kind of gentle warning for us about what we must not do the next time around you
