00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
the Department of Justice has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a duty to</font>

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,069
enforce our nation's laws including our

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:08,340
immigration laws those laws requires to

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,830
properly remove aliens when they are

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,120
convicted or detain of certain crimes

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,320
unfortunately some states and cities

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,869
have adopted policies designed to

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,880
frustrate this enforcement of

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,029
immigration laws this includes refusing

10
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,029
to detain known felons on the federal

detina request or otherwise failing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,149
comply with these laws for example the

13
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,700
Department of Homeland Security recently

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,460
issued a report showing that in a single

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,090
week there were more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 200 instances</font>

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,210
of jurisdictions refusing to honor ice

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,730
detainer<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests with respect to</font>

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,070
individuals charged or convicted of

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,989
serious crimes today I am urging states

20
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,170
and local jurisdiction to comply with

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,600
these federal laws failure to remedy

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,210
violations because resulting withholding

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,049
grants termination of grants and

24
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,270
disbarment or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> eligibility for future</font>

25
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,659
dress Department of Justice will also

26
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,360
take all lawful steps to claw back any

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,210
funds awarded to a jurisdiction that

28
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">willfully violates 1373 we have simply</font>
