Ann Coulter who I like I mean she's tough as nails but she she called Trump's presidency early she wrote adios America's she wrote a lot of books about the wall she said yesterday that that clip that we just showed did more damage to Donald Trump than this gossipy book by Michael Wolfe what do you think of that no I don't think I began Coulter has been incredibly reactionary look Donald Trump is very cognizant of one thing he's cognizant of the problems with the daca dreamers right so what we know from immigrations and Customs Enforcement specifically US Citizenship and Immigration Services is since 2013 there have been 2139 daca recipients who've had their daca Protection's revoked because they've committed some pretty egregious crimes child sexual predation armed robbery murder rape burglary of a grand larceny now there's an old theory in law enforcement it's empirical criminological data says that Berbick crime you catch there are seven people out there doing the same crime so with the most conservative empirical numbers that would that would say that that fourteen to fifteen thousand of those 800,000 daca dreamers are out there committing crimes probably higher we know that many were they had their protections revoked they were deported in the ms-13 gang sweeps also Donald Trump is keenly aware I'm very close with many people on his campaign teams I'm the most brilliant strategist and he's keenly aware that that legalizing 800,000 daca dreamers could reverse him irreversibly turned Texas and Florida blue so I suspect there's a long-term strategy here and and what we saw yesterday was the beginning of a very cunning strategy to bring the Dems in and to put the pressure on congressional Republicans to go hardline while Trump looks like he's a cooperative I don't suspect I think Ann jumped the gun on this she thinks she saw everything I think we saw about 2% of what's really going up that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this Green and become a Premium Member you
