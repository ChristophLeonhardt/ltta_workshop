1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
this bipartisan group as Democrats and
Republican lawmakers for the white house

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,450
that board war we're trying to work
things out together that's a positive

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,190
thing and it's good for the Republicans
or the Democrats and this group knows

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,350
that very well
whether we can do the incredible things

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,519
we're doing in working in a bipartisan
fashion obviously would be a positive

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,390
and I think something Tom that we all
feel about I want to thank Tom readings

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,309
than the friend of mine for a long time
he was there right at the beginning and

8
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,469
there was a very fashionable there and I
really appreciate it and Jack Josh got

9
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,950
heimer for helping to organize this very
important gathering I think it's really

10
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,660
the whole concept of what we're trying
to do is very very important inspired by

11
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,410
the example of our own citizens we
should be able to come together to make

12
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,559
government work for the people that's
why I was elected that's why I ran and

13
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,350
abroad provide jobs and opportunity to
millions of struggling families this

14
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,700
includes tax reform that is pro-jobs
pro-growth pro-family and pro-american

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,490
very simple full program there are four
principles for tax reform make the tax

16
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:27,210
code simple and fair cut taxes
substantially it will be the largest tax

17
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,909
decrease in the history of our country
for the middle class encourage companies

18
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,329
to hire and grow in America and by doing
that we're going to have to reduce the

19
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:42,930
taxes for companies right now we're 35
percent and really much higher when you

20
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,790
way of state taxes and and China is at
fifteen percent then we wonder why are

21
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,869
we not competing well against China so
there are fifteen percent and we're at

22
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,360
thirty five plus and that doesn't work
and bring back trillions of dollars we

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,829
have trillions of dollars overseas that
will bring back and we'll bring them

24
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,830
back quickly so this is money that Josh
and Tom and everybody in the

25
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,400
everybody's agreed to bring it back two
years but it never gets done so we're

26
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,350
putting it down as part of our tax
proposal another bipartisan project that

27
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:22,710
is urgently needed is infrastructure and
infrastructure investment for decades

28
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,220
now Washington has allowed our
infrastructure to fall into a state of

29
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:32,820
total decay and disrepair and it's time
now to build new roads new bridges

30
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:39,810
airports tunnels highways and railways
all across our great land when we set

31
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,310
aside our differences and it's amazing
sometimes how little our differences are

32
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,750
we put our country and we put the
citizens of our country first and that's

33
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,560
what this is all about so we want to
have a great new tax cut and tax reform

34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,600
simplification and massive cuts and we
want to get our country working again in

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,520
competing again worldwide and there'll
be nothing that can stop was on top of

36
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,180
that we'll be discussing probably a
little bit of health care because I know

37
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,850
some informations come to light so we'll
be discussing because ultimately well we

38
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,970
have some Democrats I want to think I
think I can speak for the Republicans

39
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,380
generally but we do want to do something
very very powerfully with respect to

40
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,730
Obamacare it has not worked the rates
are going through the roof

41
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:36,020
the numbers that you look at no matter
where you go no matter where you look

42
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,810
health care is failing in our country
and we're going to get a change and

43
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,290
we're going to get a change fast
infrastructure we'll be talking about

44
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,420
and we'll probably also be talking about
daca because we don't want to forget

45
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,520
daca and it's already been a week and a
half and people don't talk about it as

46
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,450
much we want to see if we can do
something with regard to immigration

47
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,440
with regard to the 800,000 people that
are now young people that have children

48
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,890
anymore they were children
they're young people but we want to see

49
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,870
if we can do something in a bipartisan
fashion so that we can solve the daka

50
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,040
problem and other immigration problems
so we'll be discussing that today

51
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,870
and then tonight I'm having dinner with
Senator Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and

52
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:27,729
we'll continue some discussions so we
have a lot of things in the fire but I

53
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:30,550
think right now
first and foremost so that we can

54
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,290
compete again and especially in light of
the fact that we had two massive earth

55
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:40,030
hands the likes of which I guess our
country has never seen I don't think

56
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,419
they've ever seen one was the biggest
ever in water and the other was the

57
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:49,120
biggest ever in wind and then you put up
together and we have devastation in

58
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:57,039
Texas and in Florida and we've done and
other parts of our country and I think

59
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,639
we've gotten very high marks for the way
we've handled them thus far and we

60
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,020
continue to handle it well but they were
they were very big and very powerful and

61
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:12,610
was very unfortunate but because of that
more than ever we now need great tax

62
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:19,210
reform and great tax cuts so we are here
as a group bipartisan to try and see

63
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,240
what we can come up with thank you all
very much I appreciated

64
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,169
skeptical of this new corrosive
demographic and tell them why have a

65
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:34,310
leader Pelosi and Senator Schumer over
tonight but Sir doesn't prescribe well

66
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,080
I'm a conservative and I will tell you
I'm not skeptical and I think that if we

67
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,199
can do things in a bipartisan manner
that will be great now it might not work

68
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,419
out in which case we'll try and do
without but I think if we can do in a

69
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:51,500
bipartisan manner if you look at some of
the greatest legislation ever passed it

70
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,210
was done on a bipartisan manner and so
that's what we're going to hidden step

71
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,590
if you've always been doing if it works
out great and if it doesn't work out

72
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,190
great hopefully we'll be able to do it
anyways Republicans okay thank you

73
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,490
we're looking at a 15% rate and we want
a 15% rate because that would bring us

74
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,919
low not by any means the lowest but it
would bring us to a level where China

75
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,289
and other countries are and we will be
able to compete with anybody nobody will

76
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:33,020
be able to touch us so we would like to
see 15 percent okay thank you very much

77
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,570
everyone
and by the way lower and lower or

78
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:43,480
individuals much lower than that for
individuals and the rich will not be

79
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,340
gaining at all with this plan we're not
looking for the middle class and we're

80
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,390
looking for jobs jobs meaning companies
so we're looking at for the middle class

81
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:59,740
and we'll look at a job I think the
wealthy will be pretty much where they

82
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,510
are pretty much where they are we can do
that we'd like it if they have to go

83
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,990
higher they'll go higher frankly we're
looking at the middle class and we're

84
00:07:07,990 --> 00:00:00,000
looking at jobs okay thank you very much
thank you thank you
