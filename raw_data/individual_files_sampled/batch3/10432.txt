Equador says it will no longer intervene on behalf of Julian Assange in talks with the UK over his exile status at the South American Embassy in London the decision marks a departure from previous Ecuadorian efforts to negotiate a way for Assange to leave the embassy without facing charges of extradition Ecuador has no responsibility to take any further steps we are not mr. Assange as lawyers nor are we representatives of the British government this is a matter to be resolved between Assange and Great Britain Assange s relations with the country have soured since the current government took office last year the founder of WikiLeaks is now suing Ecuador for allegedly violating his human rights that's after the embassy imposed House Rules for the whistleblower as a condition for partial access to the Internet and former Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa has called his country's handling of the case shameful we gave asylum to Julian Assange this is a obligation of the federal government to protect this house you have to remember that now Assange has the Ecuadorian citizenship so he's not just the asylum now he is protected by the Ecuadorian Constitution these rules are really ashamed you know they try to emulate Assange and they they are humilate in the South they are humiliating Ecuador my country because they are home these rules are really against human rights and they try they are trying to isolate Assad and to push him to abandon our embassy Assange has been holed up inside the embassy in London since 2012 when he was granted political asylum there the UK wants him for violating his parole terms but the whistleblower fears London will simply extradite him to the US if indeed he steps outside of the embassy American lawmakers meantime have doubled down on efforts to have him extradited over espionage charges in a letter to Ecuador's current leader Lenin Moreno they demanded Assange be handed over to US authorities risking a possible diplomatic fallout otherwise we are very concerned with Julian Assange has continued presence at your Embassy in London and he's receipt of Ecuadorian citizenship last year it is clear the mr. Assange remains a dangerous criminal and a threat to global security and he should be brought to justice we feel that it's very difficult for the United States to advance our bilateral relationship until mr. Assange is handed over to the proper authorities the government has to protect in a sense according to our Constitution but unfortunately because of the behavior of this government it is absolutely submit submitted to the American government well that will be very difficult I think they're going to turn it forward Asajj who the American government and the Korean citizen right now so he can get a positive decision of Ecuadorian and judges and also you don't have to to forget that he has a very important decision of the United Nations telling the Korean government to protect they have is mandatory they have to protect Julian Assange you
