in the very hometown of USC lightweight
stock habib nurmagomedov now we're in
one of the city's top restaurants for
local food we're gonna show you how to
eat like a prophet daghestani warrior
I think I just got about every bit of
food in dagestan on this table I'll take
you through all you've got we've got two
types of tutor here on the Left we've
got some pink cow Pat viola ski that's
Habib's national food we've got another
type of king/cal here and we've got some
kudos here honestly I don't know where
to start
okay we'll try with some air Shuba
wiggle this thing's got some love has
fat in it honestly that's a lot try its
monthly no honestly in the ring if it's
over five rounds of five minutes you
need some carbohydrates and this thing
is just exactly what you need
juice is well that's the first bit down
we've got a few to go yet okay I don't
know what to try next we have some shots
on Martin soup
now obviously for every little bit of
solid food that we have got to wash it
down with something liquid let's have a
little bit of a little bit of mounting
soup let's see what let's see what it
tastes like it's good could but it's mad
because it's like soup but it's not soup
I don't even I mean let's try and go a
little bit further down
here's good it all tastes good I mean
this soup this is like just on your
mother makes seriously honestly let's
try and get the air they hang out at
power bar scale this beautiful boots
just oh well is it just dope I mean it's
beautiful
all the same book it's better a little
better meat in there obviously
the sauce has a little bit flavor how
you guys got out here has got so many
athletes with so much fatty food
hey guys got so many athletes through so
much carbs unbelievable so this is what
Pakistani fighters are fueled on this is
why they won so many Olympic medals and
so many kind of places in the UFC
honestly I've only had two mouthfuls I'm
full where it's good stuff I try some
cheer oh look at that
it's like a pizza it's kind of like a
doughy pizza and beautiful I've got a
huge massive here we've got a cool Azir
which is with meat and dip it in a
little bit sauce here mmm in your mouth
now these are kind of like the Russian
dish yeah pelmeni if anybody's ever been
to Russia and tried part many they're
beautiful
it's exactly the same just in a
Pakistani style to wash it down and got
a little bit of bullion as well now boo
young I've been told not to drink it too
fast because it's very fatty
very hot so a little face
yeah it's too hot yeah they taste nice
though that's the main thing there's so
much stuff yeah I don't know what to get
I mean like this a little bit of dried
sausage these dried sausages come with a
pink of
that's good good now if you like me I
really recommend to you daghestani me
and food but if you get the meat sweats
honestly this is not the place to be
this on this play here this fueled the
first version UFC champion and have even
a mother medal this is in coal while bad
escape really tasty it's got everything
you need in there it's got your protein
it's got your carbohydrates and if you
eat your greens and enough in cow
you'll get your way to a UFC title maybe
now they say a true daghestani fighter
never knows when he's beaten but i can
definitely say that this doug is
standing food as defeated me I think I
need to go and work off these carbs
somehow so we're let's go
