stormy Daniels continues to epitomize grace and class as she compares president Trump's genitals to cartoon fungus CNN dedicates a segment to Donald Trump jr. I'm not talking about the president's son and Hillary Clinton says we need to give women accusers the benefit of the doubt I kid you not then the blazes Stuber gear drops by to talk about the news and why it matters finally the meaning of life all that and more I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show buckle up we're going below the belt today it is gonna be a saucy saucy show so the Brett Kavanaugh update you know Brett Kavanaugh the absolutely unimpeachable you know without blemish Supreme Court nominee so they've made up some crazy stuff about him and they're trying to portray him as a rapist or something to catch you up on this the accusation came from Christine Blasi Ford who says that 36 years ago or somewhere there abouts when they were drunk teenagers Cavanaugh tried to get her shirt off at a party and she doesn't remember where the party was or how it came together or exactly who was there and she's changed her story since she first mentioned it for the first time ever six years ago thirty years after it allegedly happened and the other person who says that she was in the room or the other person who she says was in the room calls the accusations absolutely nuts then another person who she says was at the party a guy named what's-his-name PJ Patrick Smith or Smythe he says that he was not at the party she then said she would testify before a congressional hearing and now she says she won't do it Christine Blasi for more like Christine blase for it if you ask me am i right because she won't to it she isn't gonna show up now surprise surprise I wonder why I wonder why because the accusation is not credible regardless of what happened or didn't happen it really now looks like nothing like what she's describing happened but now one person came out on Twitter and said that she was there and she knows about this and she was at the high school at the time and that he's guilty as sin this this tweet from this person said I graduate I graduated from Holton arms and knew both Brett Kavanaugh and Mark judge Christine Blasi Ford was a year or so behind me I remember her I signed the letter in support of her the incident was spoken about four days afterwards in school Cavanaugh should stop lying owned up to it and apologized and then so people they were running with this the media were running and tweeting and yeah yeah yeah and then and then she deleted it she deleted the tweet and then and then we now have the latest from this is also being reported on Twitter she yeah I wasn't there I don't know please don't contact me I don't want to testify so nobody wants to testify to this because mmm wonder why wonder why and the Democrats are dragging it out and out and out so before we get into how all the politicals are

personal comm slash cough FA the whole culture we're all just so obsessed with our boudoir these days and speaking of a perfect segue here is CNN CNN dedicated an entire segment to the most pressing news of the day she writes that her first sighting of Donald Trump in 2006 in his hoe tell sweet in lake tahoe was shocking Trump came swooping in wearing black silk pajamas and slippers she writes what are you doing I yelled go put some effing clothes on she writes that he changed and they both joked about his hair I pointed to his hair what's going on with this I know he said with a smile it's ridiculous she says the two talked about family what would your wife think of you being here with me stormy writes oh don't worry about that he said it's not a big deal in any way we have separate bedrooms she writes Trump then brought out a picture of Melania holding their son Barron who was just four months old at the time and when Daniels came out of the bathroom she claims Trump was lying on the bed in his underwear they had sex she then describes his genitalia in great detail his penis is distinctive in a certain way she writes I'm gonna cut it there I'm gonna cut it there I'm gonna spare you the rest of this I don't think I need to subject my audience to the rest of this this went on for four minutes that might not sound like a lot when you think about podcasts or whatever four minutes is an eternity on cable news you know I go on Fox and Friends about once a week it usually these hits are like two minutes maybe you know if they give you four minutes that is a lot of time and they spent four minutes talking about how distinctive it is in a certain way and stormy said isn't CNN facts first I'm a banana yeah they are as all bananas on CNN that's all CNN wants to talk about remember the apple and banana add a lot of bananas and it is bananas I mean this is so the next time that they're lecturing you what we need we have serious journalists every journalist at CNN there because there are a couple ostensibly not so horrible people there they should speak out against this this is disgraceful this is so so disgraceful even I get it if you want to mention the book for some reason fine four minutes on this give me a break but that's all they're gonna talk about now it's xxx we're going to talk with Stu a little bit later about about how the sex is just dominating our political culture but there are incredible iron is now when it we're getting back to Cavanaugh because that's the that's the major story here Democrats are coming out and force in total hypocrisy jumping on this it is pure hackery I actually had the privilege of sitting down last night with Hillary Clinton to discuss Brett Kavanaugh that that the FBI is not conducting an independent investigation is conducting a background investigation and the client if you will the requester is the White House so the precedent that you just referred to is the precedent for getting the FBI to conduct an investigation and that's what the White House should do now you can believe Hillary Clinton here you actually can in a certain respect if anybody knows about getting investigated by the FBI it is that old crooked Crone she has been the object of law enforcement since what the eighties the 70s so we're going to be speaking with Ken Starr soon I mean she back deals in fraud and money laundering getting getting hiding documents stealing federal records this woman knows what it's like to be the subject of a federal investigation and she's pretty good at avoiding the consequences of that too but then she gets into the purest hypocrisy of them all I'm so glad was so nice of Hillary Clinton to come on my program last night he or she is in in the most stunning sexual hypocrisy of all that's what the Republicans should be doing right now from the white house down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Senate give the benefit of the doubt to the court in the country and that means have a an investigation that will then lead to a hearing that will then lead to a vote if appropriate so give women accusers the benefit of the doubt for those of you who are not familiar with Clinton EES they're amazing at manipulating language because they're both very intelligent people the Clintons and they're amazing at manipulating language to not just quite get around everything so she's saying we need to give the benefit of the doubt to the court in the country what does that mean we're gonna give the benefit of the doubt to the courts you should talk about how great citizens united was right if we're gonna give the benefit of the doubt of the country she's talking about how great it was that they like to Trump which he's really trying to say without saying is give the benefit of the doubt to women accusers but she can't quite say that because she smeared and slandered all of the credible accusers against her husband for decades Gennifer Flowers Kathleen Willey Juanita Broderick who accuses president Trump president from President Clinton of raping her we spoke to one eita Broderick on the show she smeared them trailer park trash dragged a hundred dollar bill through a trailer park and this is what you get though the bimbo eruptions she smeared all of them so what we're now being told is that women who have credible accusations made in a timely manner with evidence with witnesses against a powerful figure they should not be believed but a lady who shows up five minutes ago to say that a drunken teenager tried to take her top off thirty-six years ago and she has no witnesses and doesn't can't give any details and won't speak that woman is to be believed that's that I think that's the it's obviously hypocrisy it's obvious obviously pure hackery any time a Democrat does this is pure hackery the party of Jefferson reporting of Thomas Jefferson poor Sally Hemings the party of FDR who died in his mistress's arms the party of JFK where do I begin how many how many interns at once in the Lincoln Bedroom the party of Bill Clinton now they're lecturing us on Brett Kavanaugh a totally unimpeachably character are you kidding me that's absurd by the way I was just naming the Democrat presidents who did this kind of stuff let's not even get into the Senators and the congressman Ted Kennedy it's crazy Joe Biden jumped on the bandwagon to Joe Biden former vice president United States he is saying with regard to the Cavanaugh allegations quote for a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus nationally you've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she's talking about is real whether or not she forgets facts whether or not it's been made worse or better over time so presume that the accused is guilty guilty until proven innocent that's what Joe Biden is saying Joe Biden who I don't know if you've ever googled Joe Biden women just go down that rabbit hole on YouTube for a while smelling their hair you know no way Uncle Joe guilty until and that's what they're saying now until it's one of them that's accused until it's Keith Allison they're not talking about Keith Allison are they woman credibly accusing him of beating her they don't talk about Bob Menendez they don't tell you no not those guys it's pure pure hackery and we cannot we cannot tolerate this we shouldn't we've got to get to stew in a second but we should not tolerate this as Republicans because some conservatives are getting squishy on this rock do that who has an interesting perspective he is a conservative never Trump conservative at the New York Times he's saying basically the same thing as Joe Biden he's saying almost the same thing today that we should that it's incumbent on Brett Kavanaugh unfair as it may be to prove that he didn't do it to prove that he wasn't there he didn't - no it's not no it's not incumbent on him and it's absurd for for Republicans and conservatives to try to hem and horns well I don't know it should Mel maybe he's you know and I didn't do it no it's a totally ridiculous charge it's pure hackery it even if he did try to get a girl's shirt off 36 years ago first of all there should have been some sort of investigation and the same people who were saying that when you commit a crime as a teenager it shouldn't be held against you for the rest of your life if you come into crime as a 25 year old it shouldn't be held against you a lot of people on the Left don't allow them to get away with this and first of all there's no evidence when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh don't allow them to get away with this it's so important I think there are some conservatives and Republicans and members of the administration who just want to get rid of them and do someone else evanka according to some report which is probably bogus but Ivanka Trump is apparently saying that we should they should can Cavanaugh there are people who are saying we should we should cut cut bait here a Jeff Flake is saying we need to hear her out no we don't know we don't stop it if we lose on this if we allow them to bork Brett Kavanaugh - to slander this guy who is apparently spotless we're never gonna get another judge through we can't win anything why if we can't get Brett Kavanaugh through we can't get anything through I don't I don't know what we're even running for at this point it becomes a circus it is so much more important than their having us believe I'll explain that in a second before we do that you need we're talking about how we can thrive aren't we and so let's talk about thrive market you know that I love thrive market check out thrive market calm slash michael mi CH AE L I love them because sweet little Elise's been gone for a few days she's visiting her family

but don't give in on Brett Kavanaugh where do we go from there first of all any guy any guy whoever is up for any political position is dead make if an unsubstantiated claim about trying to get a girl's top off 36 years ago with no evidence no witnesses even though the witness won't speak or the the accuser won't speak if that can torpedo your entire career every man is finished on both sides of the aisle it's not just affecting Republicans every guy's finished probably most women are finished who can survive that you can't give in with their what they're gonna try to say is a rule Kavanagh he's compromised get someone else get you know get just go for someone else come on it's not a big deal we'll get there are plenty of other good judge candidates no no no no if it weren't a big deal they wouldn't be pushing so hard at this don't let them get away with this it is immoral to let them get away with this do not let them do it and all right.we that that's my important message to all conservatives and Republicans we've got to talk about all the important news though like game up 'its and the ban of memes throughout Europe and for that we bring on Stu Bergere who is on the Glenn Beck program he's on the news and why it matters and there Glenn Beck guys are hanging around the studio this week and I love Stu he's got a great perspective so let's bring him in Stu Joe thanks for having me so it an honor so well you know you were just around here you figured out gosh I've got five minutes because I was on your show yesterday yeah yeah the news and why it matters yeah I was a lot of fun there was a ton of fun yesterday and especially in this news cycle I'm actually beginning to question the premise of your show yeah which is the news matter I'm not convinced at all we've got thirty-five-year-old accusations we've got the president's Mario Kart Wii I don't I don't need any of that it's disturbing it's very disturbing the news and why it's disturbing is the news why you should pay attention to something because there are other very important news stories today yes I would say after the Mario Kart and after the the most important news stories are Bert and Ernie a well-known Sesame Street puppets there's a big debate on between different writers and creators of them as to whether or not they're gay coincidentally I don't know why this is but in my notes for our interview whoever taped this put a gay pride stick around there so we have their vote or Bert and Ernie game Bert and Ernie you know they're a wonderful team and they've provided us so much happiness for so long I don't think they're gay then here's my premise for this okay the guy who created them said they're not gay and is that all the other no I got no deeper okay um they're made of felt okay most gay people are not made of felt now they're made of our genders your ire being right it's something shiny right felt isn't shiny at all sure puppets don't usually have any genitals no so it's difficult for them to engage in any section you know I don't know I've never taken clothing off of a puppet or use some kind of brick Aven over here I'm checking out puppet there was an incident at a party I don't want to go to it threaten administration yeah Miss Piggy was involved it was not pretty but yeah that's an interesting thing is that we have to come up now with sexuality for puppets uh you know for the guy I was it was actually kind of sad the guy who who kind of brought this to everybody's attention he said he was a writer I guess for many years for Bernie which I thought they came up with all their own material and I'm a little frustrated I know it's all there was more exalted I think Marc Saltzman and he said he always considered them gay and he wrote them as if they were gay and he modeled them after his own relationship and he's gay but I thought that was really sad because Bert and Ernie sleep in separate beds is this guy what what's happening at the house imma die I think he's got the right idea yeah I want to stretch out I don't need somebody rolling over on to me and I separate beds is fine separate California Kings I mean yes well that's the problem I think they had twins and like you're an adult yeah I you know I know you're on a kids show I believe Bert and Ernie were full full-grown I don't believe they're ever getting any taller so I you know I think that the twin bed thing was a little rough it's just it's just like I we can't you know Glenn's booked he's out here two pornos booked and agitate the outrage it's like this is the typical thing the typical nonsense we have to get excited about every day and it's you know on that point is I got the book yesterday really enjoying it so far this is people might have seen glenn beck was out we were smoking cigars he was puffing out of a bong yesterday and but there is this constant need to politicize everything to be outraged at everything and when it comes to Bert and Ernie being gay of course the the reasonable person would just say are you kidding me but but there is a question to culturally why does every friendship have to be gay now like you know when guys are buddies they're like oh man I that was a really fun last night no homo no right or no we're not gay you just you actually I'm not gay it can be funny or whatever it is weird that Bert and Ernie lived together for so long yeah but what happened to friendship why can't people just be guys be platonic friends and not everything be very sexual I don't know how to limit say yes I think they can be platonic first I feel like I have several now they may make a move on me at any time so you might make a move on them I don't know barrows and maybe we're sitting to the wake away from making a decision you never know and it's like I don't know like I I can understand like there's part of me that understands this right like if you if you've been around for a long time and and in you're gay and you feel like I haven't been accepted you're looking maybe for cultural things that you can kind of attach yourself to but you don't get to force the creative abilities of the people who created these things I mean you know the you know Frank Oz is he came up with us and he he has an opinion about who these people are they're good friends you know it was at a time in which we didn't try to force sexuality and the kids shows children's programming wasn't the target for gay or straight sexuality that it wasn't a great place for it and I feel like in reality everybody knows this right what but like we have to wake up every day and to find our reason to get through the day to give ourselves a little bit of energy a little bit of juice to make our lives have a little meaning we got to get something to get pissed off about and you know that's nonsense it doesn't make me happy right I don't know anybody it does make happy in the long term long run and I would rather go back to a time in which you know I have kids I have two small kids five and seven and they're in even though they don't think they watch I don't think I've ever seen them watch Sesame Street but like there's the Michael Nolt show but they don't want that this is we just put knowles on repeat all day but and they learn a lot they learn a lot but they're saying interesting the words remain yeah but you know it's it's I'd rather have them that's something you want to teach your kids you want to walk through that journey with them you don't need that talk to them by Sesame Street all you know if they're gonna be taught by a puppet I I'd rather have control of what the puppet says you know right and there is this part of it outraged culture which is why are we always outraged over these sex things the storm you Daniel's yeah whatever I think in part it's not because we've suddenly discovered sex you know people have known about sex for a long time it's just that it's such a basic and fundamental passion that we just focus on it to the exclusion of other things because we're not capable of thinking of other things all people want to talk about in politics is gay marriage gay sex abortion Roe vs. Wade this then it's all and Donald Trump's flings with porn stores it's all sex sex sex all the time I think it might have to do with people not reading books or not having other interests we're not maintaining other sorts of relationships right I mean like it's it's hard to get people's attention right you go into this books are long they're hard they've got words they're all over the place there's almost no pictures and many of them yeah it doesn't have any pic oh you don't want to see the pictures in glenn book yeah you never want to see pictures of Glenn that's a rule I always lived by but it's true it actually takes time and I think this happens so much in politics right like where you know you can go through hell I mean how many times did you good week it went deep into you know under the Obama care bill you're going deep into all these like really in-depth you know pieces of legislation that they're passing and you get about halfway through some of these sentences and you you feel like you look up and there's just everyone's like days.there button they're on their phones they've they've gone to you know they're playing you know candy crush whatever they're doing and sex can easily redirect that conversation I mean you know the Cavanagh thing like they tried they tried going down the road of well he's you know what they tried they tried to portion or - I'm Ernie overturn that right right like they went through all no one was trying constitute and they weren't saying hey this guy doesn't know the Constitution they weren't saying hey this guy's not qualified they were like hey you know 36 years ago this guy may have done something at a party which we don't know when it was or was or you know who was there you don't really remember it remember it it's like get rid of in it because that was the only thing that could get anyone's attention if you're talking about the things a Supreme Court justice should actually be judged on you get no audience and it's frustrating you know I mean I this happens way too much and it happens on both sides at some level but the media in particular like they will take every Donald Trump tweet and try to make the biggest thing in the world out of it and it's like you know what is he doing like they'll make this big thing about how he's so easy on Russia right you know ignore his tweets ignore what he says there's no worry actions and his intrusions he's been tough on Russia mmm sanctions all over the place tougher than Barack Obama much tougher than a Barack Obama and you know there's no recognition of that in the media or at least it's very rare and I think it's because well a tweet is like the ultimate journalists lazy tool right like we're thinking about like journalism 20 years ago you'd have to go to a place and you have to find people who are there and you'd have to ask them questions and they blather on about nothing for a while and then at the very end they maybe say something that you have to pull out for TV now go to Twitter search key terms find someone who says they were there put it on the screen your quotes done you didn't have to walk out of yep that's right and I feel like that's in that now or to the point where even when something of the presidency of the United States or any cultural issue they just go on and they'll find a few tweets to support their case and and that's it it's it's honestly just lazy but it reinforces you know that addiction that we were talking about people are just bouncing back and forth looking for them because outrage is lazy anybody can do it anybody can pretend to do it how dare you Barry I'm sorry I'm offending all the Americans and there I've noticed this on Twitter I I can I'm perfectly happy going hard fighting for your team fighting for your guys not letting them railroad Kavanagh you know being a pugilist punching back twice a sword I'm all into that but one should have some perspective right I always find on Twitter if I'm genuinely getting angry you have to get off Twitter yeah you have to shut it down nothing good will come of that but that seems like it's the whole media cycle now it's all of the certainly on the left it's not true on the right as well and so if if are now if our news cycle has become outrage and tweets and memes I want to focus on those reports the tweets and the memes and the Internet of it all hmm in the European Union right they are debating the important issues not Russia encroaching on their borders not the Islamic invasion or the 65 terrorist attacks in the last four um none of that no that's no no no they're gonna ban means they're gonna ban internet memes this is a real thing they're debating article 13 to censor internet memes what is this about well I mean they say it's about copyright right and because you know if you have an emo the office well then the office really owns that still shot that you're posting a moving print on I mean but that seems to be just a scam right like you know first of all I think we've learned over the years that trying to censor content on the Internet does not go well you know you lose control of your industry quite quickly when you do that but this seems to have more of a political motive motive right like the you know they've seen the effectiveness of this stuff it does it does move people yeah and then in a way I think going back to the previous conversation is sat right like you shouldn't be moved politically by a meme but I think I don't know that have you seemed like really really really good me well there really well it's it's it's kind of ridiculous right you should be moved by a book you should be moved by a Supreme Court argument you should not be moved by a picture from Parks and Rec what about the one of the guy with the girl and he's looking at the one girl holding the hand of the I mean that that's very convincing that's an exception yes that is hard cases make bad law I feel like our new constitution should just be that picture and we should just play it freedom on one side and that's just the whole thing that me someone would read it then it would be interesting but yeah I think that like they've seen the success of this and how they can get people to you know move really quickly a lot of times to ideas that weren't really considered you know kind of in the Overton Window of politics before right and that's scares an organization like the EU which I would argue should ban itself and just go away right of course right you know like that that would be my idea but it's like they want to make sure that they have got control they these things that come up they're going to try to push them down however you know that the closer they are to control over these arguments the better and more secure they feel and I think it's connected to the outrage I think the two are because we're the memes come from the reason I really defend the meme this I don't know baby especially the one with the guy in the girl yeah well that one especially that one is because they're funny and they they take on political issues with humor they might be shallow who might be partial but they are funny and the reason that they're allowed to be funny the reason that the right is able to take ahold of humor is because the left is so angry and shrieking and pink hat man oh you know because they're doing that right now because they are living in such a fantasy we're allowed to make fun of them and end it and it works it's really funny and so I see this move by the EU which is the archetypal tyrannical no like octopus body is as representative of the left which is trying to censor all of that censor that humor shut it down shut down Twitter accounts shut down conservative speakers on campuses I don't think that works for them in the long run I don't think that censorship is a winning platform it never is I mean a you know look at Mubarak you know he shuts down the entire Internet and you know he's now no longer there right I mean it's a polite way to put it yeah and it's one way but it's true I mean I think like trying to shut people away from ideas draws them to them you know I think it's it's more in the long run it gets you to a better place if people are debating these things in a you know in a way that had creates more depth but you have to get people in the door you know like we did this going back you know you know I'm on the Glenn Beck program as well and it's like we know this is kind of the philosophy of the show from it's very beginning which was the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment it's like you go in there and like you're gonna grab the people at some level with being silly and having fun with these things but like I I would imagine a lot of people came to real political positions and understanding of our foundational principles that started with memes you know if you're 15 years old you're kind of go freakin read the Constitution right I care what Ben Franklin was yappin about but if you you get a meme it's funny and then you kind of brings you to you know a store and then it brings you to you know something where they Lincoln just something with a little bit more depth and reason you're reading Edmund Burke exactly you're right there okay so I mean I think I do think that that's a process that actually happens now I have this tendency to when these new things you know like when when Twitter starts it's like to me it's just like what you want to do 140 characters that seems ridiculous I liked this is silly I mean at the beginning when blogging started like that was it was something that you kind of would like mock and like it's the same thing with talk radio I mean then the mainstream media looked at that and said that's stupid but over time these things turn into something real it really moves people it can really engage people and then that's positive as long as you take that extra step afterwards where you actually learn what the foundation is and you know hanging out with you guys the last few days obviously we've known each other yeah longer than this week but it's been so fun yeah it's really really going on the show I always I always forget how funny Glenn is too because I think of Glenn is this kind of serious guy like really really funny yeah so we're because you're you're everywhere you're on the news and why matters you're on the Glenn Beck program where can people find you all over the blaze what is the easiest way yeah people go here now well I would definitely if on Twitter what we're since we're there at world with Stu would be a great place to go follow you know obviously the Facebook everything else but the blaze yeah news and why it matters Glenn Beck program every day and a wonderful world of

you Salaam that guy is so smart yes that's really really tells me how to understand all these really confusing news cycles so um right now we've got a lot more to talk about I've got to talk about cory booker i've gotta talk about the absurd mainstream media profile of him now and why he's not gonna win the presidency I'm sorry it's it's he might be a nice guy but he's not gonna win I will explain that will explain also the meaning of life all of that more but if you want to get that you've got to go to daily wire.com if you're on facebook and youtube congratulations you haven't been kicked off yet go to daily wire.com it's ten bucks a month $100 for an annual membership if you're already there thank you you help keep the lights on what will you get you'll get me the and reclaim show the Ben Shapiro show your version of the mailbag this is what you need this is what you need the leftist tears tumblr because once we get Kavanagh through so long as those squishy little republicans don't go soft on me once we get Kavanagh through this is mmm this is I can already smell the brew it's young it's not ripe yet you know it's not quite ready but it tastes like overturning roe v wade it tastes like defending our constitution and the original meaning of that document which protects our freedom it tastes it's so good go to daily water calm we'll be right back with so much more when I wake up in the morning you know so we're usually about 12:15 12:30 you know supposed to be at the Daily wire probably ten minutes earlier when I wake up one of the first things I'd like to do is read a leftie puff piece I find they're they because then I start laughing in the day I start I start my day with some joy and a mark walberg likes to start his day working out and praying that's one way to do it I like to read Lefty puff pieces on New York Magazine The Daily Beast voxcom so there's a new one out today on Cory Booker and this made me realize that Cory Booker will never ever be the President of the United States here's the piece there are a couple points I want you to notice here I want you to notice one the difference between how the left at the left-wing media which is to say the mainstream media how the media treat Democrat politicians and how they treat Donald Trump and Republicans the title is can I get a hug Cory Booker's got a lot to give a lot of love to give and he's betting that's what it will take to win in 2020 Donald Trump had a lot of love to give to according to struck me Daniel's you don't see those fluffy titles for him that do you so I want you to notice that I want you to notice the treatment and then I also want you to notice what a horrible candidate cory booker is so so here's just the first paragraph of the piece anyone who thinks it's nothing but teeth grinding paranoia and rank misery in Washington these days hasn't been to the office of New Jersey senator Cory Booker these people are happy indeed his staff are some of the cheeriest nicest people you could ever hope to meet when I arrive on a hot swampy morning just before Labor Day weekend I'm greeted with hugs and candy an exuberant woman in a dashiki sits at reception what's a dashiki well we'll get to that later Kristen Lynch the communications director greets me okay hugs me and takes me to Booker's office where we say hello to his chief of staff Matt clapper who also hugs me Booker has not hugged me yet but give him time a young staffer comes in and hands Booker a brown paper bag and tells him she managed to score the last three in the cafeteria from the look of joy on his face I imagine a bag of cheeseburgers but alas it's just celery and carrot sticks in black stick deli containers Booker is a vegan he opens one up and munches on a carrot munches on a carrot I am gonna hold my tongue hold my tongue Michael that's what I'm gonna do so where to begin where to begin on the hugs and the love and the dashikis so they're painting this picture of him as this wonderful guy because there is a portion of the Democrats who want him to be the nominee especially in New York and New Jersey where Cory Booker is from and they're angling for Cory Booker to be the nominee you remember six years ago he was defending Mitt Romney and he was the moderate normal guy Cory Booker is a very intelligent man by the way and and so what Cory did then was he was trying to be the moderate guy and then he realized that that wasn't the ticket because his party has completely gone off the rails so now he's the crying guy with tears of rage and I love you right and he thinks that's gonna help him it's not going to help him moreover though I I want you to realize how totally isolated the left-wing media has become the elitist left-wing democrat base has become because they actually think the the New York magazine they genuinely think that eating celery and carrot sticks is likeable I think Cory Booker thinks that that being a vegan makes you likeable you're such a good person because it now in many ways it in a left-wing that has become post Christian that has become materialist in a certain way they've adopted other religious values like veganism or a yoga to borrow Matt Walsh's observation or this or that you've got to serve somebody so even if you're pretending to not worship God or not be a Christian or whatever you're gonna worship somebody you're gonna worship humanity you're gonna worship animals you're gonna worship the environment you're gonna well you're gonna worship somebody and that's what they think is gonna play this does not play look at who we just elected we elected Donald Trump we elected a guy who takes photos in private jets thumbs up well he's chowing down on KFC and slurping Diet Coke this is not going to play but to them it does because they don't know anybody who eats KFC don't know anybody who does this they I mean the the effete holes that these people come from I I've seen it I mean I've lived in coastal places I've gone to elite institutions and they really believe this this oh you know I I just had my celery sticks mm-hmm oh I just love hummus like huh I mean I like how much as much as the next guy but oh yes they would never consider eating like a pudding cup you know they never they that does not play at all and they're making another big mistake not just on the style that they're choosing but thinking that the election is going to be a bad style and not policy this is from later in the article Robby Mook who was a Clinton aide Robby the direct what Robby Mook who managed Clinton's 2016 campaign cautions against reading the upcoming campaign as a battle over policy issues so what hit what he thinks with the left believes is that this is really gonna be just about style that's why Cory Booker is pretending to cry and fight tears of Rage and hold these weepy little press conferences one he thinks that style is gonna work because his party is very feminized and all the men are these little soy boys it doesn't work nobody wants a man to behave like a woman they might say that they do they might pretend that they do they don't it doesn't look good we just elected Donald Trump who is slightly more knuckle-dragging than a Atilla the Hun in his public statements and people like that they actually want that there there might be other ways to do it but they want a man to show strength and weeping and crying at press conferences with Liz Warren ain't gonna do that but to Robby moocs point to the Democrats point that this is gonna be about style and not policy I think he's miss reading the country I think they're totally miss reading the country because they've drawn the wrong conclusions from Trump's election I hear this all the time for my lefty friends New York friends they say Donald Trump was elected in because of his worst stylistic instincts because of his worst statements because he's bad bad bad that is is not true that's what they might conclude that but that's not true from the Trump voters I know for the Trump voters that I talked to and from Ann Coulter wrote a great book about this we're gonna be talking with Ann Coulter soon Donald Trump was elected for policy purposes he was he was he was elected for the judges he was elected for immigration he was elected for tax cuts here's here's a little bit of evidence for this by the way Donald Trump for people say he has no ideological warnings he has no beliefs he has no policy preferences I don't think that's true Donald Trump presented a legitimately unique policy platform in 2016 he was talking about some of the dangers of free trade no Republican was doing that he was talking about immigration in a very blunt way because it's it's very fashionable for Republicans to say oh we really have to do something about immigration and then give everybody amnesty and keep the flood floods coming in and Trump said no we're not gonna do that we're not going to give anybody amnesty and we're gonna deport illegal aliens that was different people were not saying that before Trump he was offering a different policy platform and he was elected for that platform everybody that I talked to I talked to a lot of people I travel around the country there say all that Trump he's really got to lay off those tweets but I like what he's doing that's what it's about and it's gonna be about that and the Democrats are they've whipped themselves up into the fantasy what this election has become what the 2016 election has become and they're meta-narrative in their in their historical fiction it's not going to serve them well if this is about policy and it's going to be about an honest debate and minoo one of the great characteristics of Donald Trump is people view him as a blunt talker that he is he's he doesn't BS he tells you what he's thinking and he's kept his promises he's one of the few politicians we've seen who's actually managed to keep his promises in office that's why we're all so shocked at him I think that's what it's gonna be about before we got to go this is really rough because there's so much more to talk about I've got to talk about James O'Keefe in the deep State I've got to talk about the novel solution to Venezuelan economic crises and starvation but we've got to just skip ahead to the meaning of life I promised you that we talk about the meaning of life at the Emmys which you didn't watch I know for a fact you didn't watch them some lady who I don't know was wearing a Nike designed outfit on the red car because she was gonna tell her message and she sums up a lot of what the left and maybe even parts of the Center or thinking right now in America and I want to show the conclusions of her thoughts and the errors of her thoughts here she is look at you sporty spice why you were in night I am wearing Nike to applaud them for supporting Colin Kaepernick and his protest against racial injustice and police brutality this custom Nike absolutely drag queens come up with put some beads on it some Sparkle you know how they roll there's no good yes Kate Moss and DJ Pierce challenge alive so when did you decide to do this you know I was actually swimming the other day and I was like what can I do what can I do that's meaningful I'll wear Nike I wearing Nike that is the left there one there there in their swimming pool they're like sipping on their chichi or something and they say what can I do what can I do that's meaningful I'll wear Nike that's what they're thinking they've got existential dread they feel meaninglessness in their lives because the worldview that they have adopted and adopted militantly deprives their lives of meaning and they say what can I do what can I do I'll wear Nike they end up with these absurd ridiculous ways to try to give some meaning to their lives also regardless of their absurd politics this does remind me why I like some showbiz people is it's just they're so wacky they're just say and then the drag queens came over and they put beads on my yeah you know there's just this kind of innocent sweet things I don't know she doesn't seem like a political philosopher exactly so perhaps she can be forgiven some of her her political ignorant but that really highlights everything you know the hosts at the Emmys the SNL guys one of the jokes was they said you know white people never thanked Jesus they never thanked God in their acceptance speeches the only white people who thanked God in their acceptance speeches are Republicans and X crackheads and this got a ton of outrage there so upset show me the lie show me the lie show me the white person who thanks God in his acceptance speech who isn't a Republican or an axe crackhead I can't find one I don't know where it where is he this gets to a real point about the modern left which is that they've deprived themselves of meaning they boo God at their National Convention they remove God from their platform they try to remove God from their platform they don't have a meaning on top of their life so they have to find it in ridiculous places they're looking for love in all the wrong places that's the problem if you want the cure to outrage first of all take a look at the man in the mirror because you might be complaining about everyone else on Twitter being outraged but take a look at the man in the mirror especially if you're on the Left these days but also then look up you know look up the people who I know we're at that backstage yesterday with Glenn and ban and drew and Jeremy everybody and we were all kind of laughing about politics and having a good time and it occurred to me all of us believe in God all of us have pretty we have I think every one of us has different religious views but we all have a religious grounding in God in a theistic vision look at that look at if you make an idol out of politics you're gonna be really really miserable and you're gonna make yourself look ridiculous and you're gonna wear a Nike shirt to the Emmy Awards and that's not gonna age very well don't do that that isn't that shouldn't be your God there is there is something more and if you look up your you're gonna have a better time in politics and you're gonna make yourself look less absurd okay that's the show I know we're running late too bad I don't care we've got a lot more get Yuma back questions and we're gonna do that tomorrow we've got some great interviews coming up people that I'm talking to I don't know maybe Ken Starr I don't know I don't know maybe a lot of people
