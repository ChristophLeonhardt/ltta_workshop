I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report the show that goes further yes they see we go really far in fact in this episode not only are we in New York but in the second half you're gonna be in Washington DC with none other than tune these days Wow I'm looking forward to that yeah because we interviewed him when we were on our way up here stopped in Washington DC talked to him and then we came here to report the news to you and I want to talk about a story that happened last week and it is about Venezuela because they are the first to introduce a cryptocurrency as a unit of account so this is something actually when we were in Washington DC and we saw safe teen talk about his book the Bitcoin standard he foresees Bitcoin as a unit of trade account around the world now this is I think obviously Maduro and Venezuela have are not going to be able to have a genuine cryptocurrency and it's gonna be centralized as could we command and control nevertheless they've broken the the the barrier to entry so they've got this concept of a unit of account that is a crypto currency yes I think it's an important milestone I don't think it's going to be all that successful but it is breaking the crypto ceiling if I may coin that phrase with a sovereign and we have other sovereigns in the wings the Marshall Islands my understand are gonna go into puerile crypto currency to govern their territory and once we get the game theory played out on a geopolitical level that's inherent in the Bitcoin protocol the magic of the incentives as iterated in Satoshi's white paper are going to put the kibosh on the fiat currency nightmare that has plagued humanity for many many centuries part of the global imbalances that we see that are causing the geopolitical strife that is caused by the fiat currencies that is caused by not having a trade unit of account it's always been gold and obviously America became very powerful and when they had a huge imbalance whereby they owed a lot of gold to the rest of the world they decided 1971 forget it we're not going to give you your gold and they defaulted that was one of the probably I would say the biggest default in history bigger than any of the currency crises and devaluations we've seen anywhere at this point you know I never really put it on a scale like that but you could be correct they defaulted on real money they owed well at that point when in 1971 when Richard Nixon closed the gold window France had received back their three hundred million dollars worth of gold Charles DeGaulle actually sent a French naval ship to New York Harbor right out here to collect the gold then the UK Britain got worried that well maybe we should ask for ours and they did politely ask to mind jolly good fellows sending us off three hundred million dollars with the gold that you owe us and it was like slam the window and they were like okay sorry to have bothered you with well take your paper yesterday so they basically we defaulted on the United Kingdom they did not get their three hundred million dollars worth of gold instead they got three hundred million dollars with a Fiat paper and they've been basically our poodles ever since so because if they weren't gonna stand up then they weren't ever gonna stand up they were never gonna send a naval ship like France did France and a naval ship and it was a crisis situation but now speaking of crisis we have a crisis situation and then as well and it's you know many of the mainstream media might find it amusing in front and sharing it on but the fact is according to the IMF they're going to have 1 million percent inflation hyper that's hyperinflation that's not just inflation that's hyperinflation so some of our guests will say that hyperinflation is actually a political event unlike inflation or deflation which are monetary events is from is caused by printing too much money beyond the productivity in the production of your capacity of your economy but hyperinflation is clearly when the population nobody trusts you the leader of the country or the leader of the banking system to control the supply of money and that has clearly happened with the introduction of Maduro over say Chavez when he passed away he had show us had a lot of inflation in the economy but never hyperinflation no it's currency collapse which is a political event as you point out you know talking about hyperinflation in the past it happens with fiat money often and so now Venezuela is going to question is will there be a contagion I guess and where will this go with it can it be contained it certainly all across the emerging market all the emerging market currencies look like they are poised for a continued degradation and collapse I mean we're seeing numbers we haven't seen in a long time in South Africa in other countries it just looks like a bloodbath now remember what happened in Zimbabwe when they had hyperinflation under Mugabe and you you get those famous trillion Zimbabwe dollar notes and what happened is they couldn't control it anymore and he just let the population use whatever currency they wanted it would take euros dollars gold silver whatever so I think eventually that will happen here nevertheless are trying a cryptocurrency which i think is quite radical and it's quite interesting that desperate times whenever you have a desperate situation whether it's Cyprus or Argentina or China with their capital controls people are flood the individuals are flooding to Bitcoin as a way to escape these sanctions now Maduro has introduced this unit of account which is the petrol against which their new currency is pegged but that this is supposed to help people escape some sort of sanctions and circumvent the sanctions but by the way President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order barring any us-based financial transactions involving the petrol with officials warning that the venezuelan cryptocurrency was a scam which is quite interesting because if you go to any reddit board or twitter crypto twitter everybody's talking about scams of pumps and pump and dumps and and poo coins well this is an IC o to take the cake in terms of i cos that are running into trouble this is like tezo smith's file coin meets all the top big you know Venezuela's got a lot of oil but they don't have any refineries and this is pegged to oil you know and they're trying to leverage their oil position through the machination of a crypto currency you know my suggestion is you know maybe build a few refineries you know and sell higher-end and put that money back into the economy in this way may take 10 or 15 years but you're not going to be now taken over by some CIA operative like we've read about in John Perkins book confessions of a financial hitman economic economic hitmen and you know become just a vassal state of Exxon it's called the resource curse they always this always happens it when you know that US invaded Iraq and then oil prices soared and they stayed up there for a long time and it becomes easy you're just getting free money it's it's literally like somebody who has a token or an ICO they get a whole bunch of free money and what do they do they never build their product because exactly they got free money and it becomes like well I do I work like they import all their food that's what happens in Venezuela which is always in danger you never like leave not only do you never take out debts and foreign currency that you can't print but you never leave your economy totally it's something like a huge percentage ninety percent of their food is imported which is crazy you shouldn't leave yourself at that because now you your population starves but there was a interesting a few interesting quotes in these articles from last week when they were talking about the introduction of the petrol into as a unit of account Bloomberg said confusion reigns as Maduro megha devaluation royals Venezuela because remember they had a 96% devaluation overnight but they did increase minimum wage by 3000 percent the package of measures combines the necessary with the baffling luis vincent de leon president of the Karaka based pollster data analysis said in a Twitter post on Friday quote the government has recognized the need to anchor the economy to an external variable outside of its control such as the International price of oil a wise decision but it does so by hiding it in a vehicle that suffers from lack of confidence and viability such as the petrol this is the classic case of a one-eyed King you know the the man who is in power but is technically blind and but he feels the topography of his power structure and he can sense certain realities but he's blind to the macro picture here and as a result this frickin thing's going down Venezuela is really because Chavez you know he wanted to be liked so he engaged in this massive wealth redistribution plan but there would have been a lot more benefits if he built some refineries and took on some of the hard realities of having a capitalist economy that supports entrepreneurialism and now we're seeing the inevitable result this is what the lesson you would think would be learned in America because you've got these new Social Democratic socialists in America and he keeps saying well when as well is an example of where that's going and they go well they didn't do it right they didn't do it right you know it's the thing is it's never done right it never works and those northern European countries people keep referring to as being examples of successes in socialism those are not socialist countries those are called mixed economies it's capitalism plus socialism mixed together and they are not exactly that great either of course Norway is one they keep on referring to and of course what has Norway done they've saved almost every single penny that came in from all of their oil wealth they don't spend it they put it in for a rainy day unlike the United Kingdom which converted leveraged it up into debt so there are different sort of economies it is up to the leader and that's what I'm saying hyperinflation is when basically the population and then the world loses faith and the leader is ability to manage it but here we have this notion of a cryptocurrency being introduced into an economy and I'm saying that the previous hyperinflation that they tried to contain for quite a few years with Zimbabwe everybody made fun of that and made fun of them but they basically just abandoned their own currency and said use whatever currency here at the same time you have this highly subsidized oil and energy prices there you pay 10 cents a gallon he's increased that for some people in the economy you still get it subsidized if you file some paperwork but here you can have just tell the population stop arresting them let the mine bitcoin let them create wealth like that's a way for them to they can out-compete anybody else on earth because they have the cheapest energy prices bingo that would be a genius move like we're subsidizing energy instead of like a Wall Street subsidizes American plutocrats by printing money accessible only to them Maduro can say okay we've got the frickin cheapest energy around mine your own cryptocurrency and start building your own houses talk to your neighbor create aquifer pumping Dino Wells and feed yourself grow stuff let's get this show on the road but instead he's an egomaniacal you know nutjob who's gonna think that he could raise wages look bring a crypto anti door it's like dude you need to go to a shrink cuz you're out of your mind in the last three seconds here I want to say he quote this is a quote from him they being the Americans have dollarized our prices I am Petra lysing salaries and Petra lysing prices he said we are going to convert the petrol into a reference that pegs the entire economy moving and just replace that with Bitcoin that's how you fight it you you do a bitcoin is a ssin and set your population free say dudes go and mine Bitcoin and and take it to you know be wealthy yeah Maduro you can fix this in five minutes forget the fricken whatever crypto nonsense you're building go bitcoin alright well we have to take a break and when we come back there'll be tone phase V tone base right here don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to go to tone vase tone welcome back oh thank you I think this is number three for me that's incredible you know three is the charm and they become an official frequent guest at this point so tone vase you are master of the charts it's a technical analysis of Bitcoin in other markets and you know the chart sometime coincide with events and only in retrospect do you see that hey you know that happened at that time and that price happened at that time and you know what's the relationship so the question is that you know it's seemingly Bitcoin price peaked when those futures were launched and you're a longtime Wall Street guy and you know all about how this whole futures markets work is there a connection wasn't relation do you see any underlying connection yes there is a connection but it's a little more subtle than people like to think I don't believe that the future launch themselves is what's causing the price to drop since the day of the future launch the way I see it is people were way too optimistic leading into the launch of the futures that caused the price to go up way further than otherwise would it's one of those classic buy the rumor sell the news in this case it's more like buy the expected event but then once the event happened people realized that it wasn't gonna have that much of an effect but the volume in those futures is not very high it's still a pretty niche market and what I always said was these futures do not have actual Bitcoin settlement like gold does like oil does Bitcoin settlement that looks like that's coming to this new New York Stock Exchange product called backed what's happening there what's the big news there so that is gonna be an interesting product they announced that they're planning to do that I still have not seen anything from the regulator's giving them full permission to do that this may not happen for another year I don't know when they're actually going to launch it I know the expectation is gonna be November we'll see I have a feeling that is going to take a little bit longer than that then November once you have futures that are have deliverable of the underlying asset now things become a lot more interesting however Bitcoin can still Bitcoin still gets its actual price from the underlying exchanges so it really depends on that dynamic like we know that gold futures and oil futures on the CME is the 95 percent of price discovery of gold and oil but when it comes to the stock market the futures on the S&P 500 are pretty much almost meaningless because the underlying companies that determine the value of the S&P 500 and the futures is just a way for people to bet and the speculation of what those companies will do I'm very curious in five years from now where is the price discovery of Bitcoin is it the future space or is it still these underlying exchanges and we will see all right so price discovery you know this is buyers and sellers coming into the market and depending on who's got the bigger orders the buyers are the sellers you get an uptick or a downtick Bitcoin has been immune from a lot of stuff we've seen in the gold market where you have unpacked paper claims or naked short sales have come in and they drive the price of gold lower and I was listening to a podcast with Kate long and tres Mayer just recently and this whole backed scenario with the New York Stock Exchange she believes it's about the financialization of Bitcoin and that we're gonna start seeing on back pay per Bitcoin claims coming into the market and corrupting that price discovery like we've seen in gold and then there's a couple of ways that this could go or could not go any thoughts on that I have not had time to listen to our podcast yet but I've talked about it myself as well I actually don't have a big problem I don't believe that there is a conspiracy driving the price of gold down because I am capable of trading those futures I can short gold with my twenty thousand dollar brokerage account I can't buy a thousand contracts but I can buy three or four contracts with that money the thing is in these futures contracts of gold and of course there are more open contracts than the ability to deliver that gold but as maturity comes close those contracts cancel each other out like a big buyer could come in and raise the price of gold I just don't see that as a conspiracy and the same thing will probably happen in Bitcoin but it doesn't mean that it's gonna drive the price down someone could threaten to deliver that's why I call it it doesn't have to be the delivery of gold or delivery of oil the threat of the delivery of that big size so if someone comes in and buys 3,000 contracts on Bitcoin you don't know if they have the Bitcoin to deliver or not the exchange probably does and if that person doesn't have the ability to deliver that Bitcoin but they have enough cash in order to keep the margin in that large position they will just cancel that position against the guy in the other side that doesn't have the ability to accept all that Bitcoin so I think it's still pretty fair price discovery I always go back to the most manipulated market in the world is diamonds you want to make diamonds a more legitimate price discovery put it on the CME give it futures markets let the average person speculate as well and then we'll see real price discovery I think the price discovery on gold is fine people just don't care anymore to that point if there are such a huge discrepancy between the naked short sale driven artificial price and the true physical price why wouldn't someone take physical delivery of their gold on those markets and force that price discovery and close that gap I mean there's a huge arbitrage and if that exists you know that's like free money so usually if there's that much free money around people would go grab it because no one really wants to take delivery of a hundred tons of gold but if you're making a ton of money you know a lots of money on it it could be worth a few billion yeah and you can collect that billion when you cancel out that contract it's almost like oil like I can trade oil contracts from my living room in New York just as easily as I can trade gold contract in short oil can long oil I was a day trader in the futures markets just for my house as an individual and the exchange knows I can't take that one futures contract on the oil is a thousand barrels of oil they know I have no ability to accept delivery of a thousand barrels of oil in my one-bedroom apartment in New York City they know that's not gonna happen they also know I have no ability to deliver a thousand barrels of oil because I'm living in a Manhattan apartment they know my address so they will make sure that if I don't sell my position on my own a week before maturity they will sell it for me and they do it the same way for others they are matching people up you know you are the bane of the Lambo buying crowd you know because for many years in the crypto space the Lambo maniacs who were making a lot of money on the crypto space altcoin space you know Bitcoin made a move from a thousand to twenty thousand almost in one year back in 2017 your technical analysis which are very rigid about obeying what you see in the charts you don't let that your personal bias get in the way you know you've have called us bear market that we've been in but the lambo people are always complaining well how do you feel about that you know you're you're bringing a lot of unhappiness to the would-be lambo buyer tom yes i actually embrace it it always tells me that I'm kind of right like the more people tell me how bullish we are the the crowd is always wrong you know that max you've seen enough of the markets and one Bitcoin bounced off of 6,000 and it started making its way back to 10,000 somebody baited me into a big bet saying it would never fall below six and I took that bat took that big public bath and there was a Twitter poll saying what are the chances I was gonna win the bet that is gonna go back down below 6,000 and 70% of the people said I was gonna lose that bet and now I know but the one that I saw that poem like great this means I'm gonna win the bat because the majority will always be wrong and the price went down to below 6,000 we hit 50 750 people are still you know over bullish at the moment I'm hoping that the price will only come down to 5,000 but it's possible it can go even lower there needs to be some pain I think we overshot to the upside big time in 2017 and we need to overshoot to the downside at least a little bit now you know interesting in this market you know you have almost a built in upward bias because every four years there's a halving so that number of coins that come into the market is half so supply is constantly shrinking is something that safe teen I'm moose writes about in the classic now classic Bitcoin standard is amazing amazing book yeah and so you'd have an upward bias what do you see you know he talks about it cannibalizing fiat money and you know you end up with price predictions as a reflection of global Forex no Forex is five trillion dollars a day if Bitcoin gets 1% of that I remember Rick me Mia up in Stockholm told me in 2011 he said that Bitcoin would get 1% of global Forex which implies a $100,000 per coin price this would be a long term chart do you look at the long term chart and what are your thoughts absolutely I think the next having which my best guess will come in around May of 2020 I think that's gonna do great things for the price of Bitcoin but it's still May of 2020 but how do you trade it because we've had a having people trade it into it you're a trader to other people what to expect people are gonna trade into the having the same exact way they traded into the ETF announcement the same exact way they traded into the the futures announcement traders are gonna want to up each other while at the last having the price of Bitcoin doubled between five and two months prior to the having with 30 days before the halving the price had already peaked and it started to come down I'm expecting right at the December November December of 2020 there's a sorry November December of 2019 that's when the having is gonna be all the rage and traders are gonna want to pre run that trade and I'm expecting huge things for the price of Bitcoin at the going into the year 2020 with the expectation about how the rumor would apply to the having absolutely and you know there's in the mark it's there's the January effect where people of course there's a January bump because people are tax selling at the end of the year and you can trade that but it moves every year because more people get into it so it happens there's some kind of rolling January effect so this having that you speaker we've had one but you say in order to maximize your trading profits you need to maybe discount for the fact that a lot of people are gonna be playing this game yes and they are we playing it and I think last year they got in early and they got out early and this year they might get in even earlier and get out even earlier sessoms they're all gonna want to pre run each other so I can see the price starting to go up in November of 2019 but already starting to fall in like March with the having coming into May and then there could be and if it sells enough and this is what people have to realize it's hard to predict so far in advance if we start going up too early we can peak in March by the time that having comes in May the price could have already bottomed out and the having itself could then cause the by the DIF like the shirt that I'm wearing right and the flip side if the selling of the news comes on the day of the news like what happened with the CME then you're not gonna get that chance to buy the dip on the news it really depends how the price gets to what it is not what the price is gonna be but at what time did it peak well as always scintillating fascinating how long have been in Bitcoin I bought my first Bitcoin in 2013 takes to listening to you and I spoke up my very first conference in q1 of 2014 and started appearing on YouTube shows of other people in mid-2014 going into 2015 from there he's got the channels YouTube Twitter follow him learn something for a change you fricken Lambo degenerate and that's gonna do it for this edition of the kaisers report with me Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert like to thank our guest tone Vaes if you want to reach us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
