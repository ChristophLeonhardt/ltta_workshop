he has been Jerry Nadler as I said thanks for sticking with me you are a crucial player in all this what do you make of what's happening well I think the president is desperate and flailing about I think he is considering apparently a firing Rosenstein in order to either fire Muller or put the brakes on Muller that would be an absolute act of obstruction of justice and in fact the president if he did that would have pre convicted himself out of his own mouth but what he's been saying and tweeting in the last few days as his corrupt motive which is to stop a criminal investigation that's the definition of obstruction of justice I hope we can prevent this I note the New York Times story tonight that says he's more that people around him are more afraid of what the Southern District in New York may find about mr. Cohen and so forth than this and if they're rational in the white house that would argue don't fire comeon and don't fire Rosenstein and Muller because you got it that's not the main threat but I don't know if they're rational in the white house I would also say I agree with senator Hirono about the Syrian strike and I would say that as striking Syria at this point would be illegal without congressional authorization because Congress has the war-making as the word declaring power and there's no excuse you cannot pretend that an attack on Syria is anything to do with the attack on the World Trade Center which is only existing or an the people who perpetrated that which is the only existing authorizations you're talking about the authorization to use military force when shortly after 9/11 which has been used to justify military activity as much as many as nine countries including the bombing in Syria no shred of justification you can't connect that to Syria well also what do you make of them when you think about the president United States right now in the way that he has acted today on Twitter the pressure he's under the fact that he apparently called Michael Cohen today in violation one would think of any sound legal counsel simultaneously making decision about how to marshal the forces of the most powerful military that has ever existed in human history I think this is very very dangerous and I'm frankly very worried I don't trust the president's judgment on military affairs now he he's gotten rid of most of the people around him who might give sound sounder judgement it's it's frightening to think that what stands between us and the new war in Syria is John Bolton well it sounds like he is advocating well that's very white bread that's that's the point he's nuts he's the biggest war hawk but coming back to to the whole question of obstruction of justice this country was attacked we were attacked by the Russians who tried to subvert our election on a democratic system call me now reveals that when the president was apprised of this his reaction was political his reaction was how does this affect me how does this affect my elect you know my legitimacy had nothing to do with how do we stop the Russians from attacking again how do we protect the country and and and and he's been behaving ever since then purely on a defensive personal level and as if he is above the law and we must establish that no man is above the law three colleagues on your committee Bob Goodlatte trove get trey Gowdy and Devon Nunez these are House GOP lawyers looming lawmakers Goodlatte of course the chair of your committee they're calling on Rosen Stein steam to release the Comey memos that in it that triggered the special counsel are they acting in good faith I don't think so I think that's it's it's the latest in a series of diversions what's that new to you by the way there did yes there was news to me it says it's the latest a series of diversions the cause for for information about the investigation of Hillary Clinton which is past tense and of interest to historians at this point but not really and interest no they have been following a consistent strategy of diversion of trying to discredit the special counsel and in advance and and and like a game of three-card Monte don't watch what's important towards this all right congressman adjourn and ler thank you for making some time on this Friday night hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
