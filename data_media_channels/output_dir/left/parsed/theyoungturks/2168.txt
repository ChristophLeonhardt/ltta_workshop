A FEDERAL COURT HAS RULED
AGAINST AN OBAMA ERA REGULATION
THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY KEEP A
CLOSE EYE ON FINANCIAL ANALYSTS
AND ENSURE THAT THEY SELL
PRODUCTS THAT KEEP THE BEST
INTERESTS OF THE CONSUMER IN
MIND.
THESE ARE NONFIDUCIARIES,
INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT HAVE ANY
PARTICULAR CREDENTIALS TO BE
SELLING THESE PRODUCTS, BUT THEY
ARE SALESPEOPLE WHO HAVE TITLES
SUCH AS FINANCIAL ANALYST,
FINANCIAL ADVISOR, FINANCIAL
CONSULTANT, FINANCIAL PLANNER,
INVESTMENT CONSULTANT, AND THEY
PREVIOUSLY, PRIOR TO THESE OBAMA
ERA REGULATIONS, HAD NO
OBLIGATION, NO LEGAL OBLIGATION,
TO SELL YOU PRODUCTS WITH YOUR
BEST INTERESTS IN MIND.
IN FACT
OFTEN TIMES THEY WOULD SELL
RETIREMENT PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS
THAT WOULD NOT HELP THEM, BUT
WOULD GIVE THEM COMMISSION AND
ALSO GIVE THEM OTHER FINANCIAL
INCENTIVES TO SELL THOSE
PRODUCTS.
NOW IN 2016 OBAMA'S
ADMINISTRATION DID IMPLEMENT
SOME REGULATIONS TO ENSURE THAT
THESE INDIVIDUALS WORKED IN YOUR
BEST INTERESTS, AND TODAY, I'M
SORRY, YESTERDAY, A FEDERAL
COURT DECIDED TO RULE AGAINST
THOSE REGULATIONS.
NOW LET ME
GIVE YOU THOSE DETAILS --
I JUST WANT TO PAUSE, ANA,
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS SO
IMPORTANT.
THAT GOES TO THE
HEART OF NOT JUST THIS CASE AND
THIS ISSUE BUT THE HEART OF THE
PROBLEM IN OUR GOVERNMENT.
IT
WAS TWO JUDGES APPOINTED BY
REPUBLICANS, AND HENCE THE
CORRUPTING OF THE JUDICIARY.
IT'S NOT THAT REPUBLICANS CAN'T
APPOINT JUDGES, OF COURSE THEY
CAN, BUT THEY ARE SELECTING
JUDGES THAT ARE ONLY
PRO-CORPORATE.
IN FACT NEIL
GORSUCH GOT THE SUPREME COURT
NOMINATION BECAUSE HE WAS THE
ONLY JUDGE IN THE COUNTRY THAT
RULED THAT A CORPORATION HAS THE
RIGHT TO ORDER ONE OF THEIR
WORKERS TO FREEZE TO DEATH, AND
THEN FIRE HIM IF HE DISREGARDS
THAT ORDER.
THAT'S AN AMAZING
RULING.
EVERY OTHER JUDGE WHO
LOOKED AT THAT CASE SAID NO, BUT
THAT WAS GORSUCH'S WAY OF SAYING
I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND
THAT GAVE HIM THE SUPREME COURT
SEAT.
SO WE PRESELECTED JUDGES
TO MAKE RULINGS LIKE THIS.
SO
THEY RULED IT IS UNREASONABLE TO
EXPECT THAT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR
WOULD HAVE YOUR BEST INTERESTS
IN MIND.
THE REASONABLE POSITION
WOULD BE FOR THEM TO ROB YOU
BLIND.
SO FOR THEM TO CARE ABOUT
YOU, THEIR CUSTOMER OR THEIR
CLIENT, AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT
TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS, IS
TOTALLY UNREASONABLE.
AND THAT
IS THE CORPORATE POSITION, IT'S
UNREASONABLE FOR US TO SACRIFICE
EVEN A PENNY OF OUR PROFITS TO
LOOK OUT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS
OR CLIENTS.
LET'S HEAR FROM THE JUDGES WHO
RULED AGAINST THE REGULATIONS,
ONE OF THEM WAS JUDGE EDITH
JONES, WHO WAS NOMINATED BY
RONALD REAGAN, HERE IS WHAT
JUDGE JONES HAD TO SAY --
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT
ATTEMPT AT LOGIC BECAUSE THERE
WAS NO LOGIC THERE.
THESE ARE
PEOPLE WHO PREVIOUSLY, PRIOR TO
THESE REGULATIONS, DIDN'T HAVE
TO DISCLOSE CONFLICT OF INTEREST
WHEN SELLING CERTAIN RETIREMENT
PRODUCTS, AND PUSHING FOR
CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, WHICH BY
THE WAY IN A LOT OF CASES THESE
INVESTMENTS WOULD WORK AGAINST
THEIR CLIENT, IT WOULD ACTUALLY
DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
THEY WOULD HAVE IN THE LONG RUN
FOR THEIR RETIREMENT, BUT THEY
DIDN'T HAVE TO DISCLOSE THE
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OR THE
INCENTIVES THEY WERE GIVEN TO
SELL THOSE TERRIBLE PRODUCTS TO
THESE CONSUMERS.
AND ALSO THEY
WOULD CHARGE FEES, AND THE
REGULATION ESSENTIALLY TOOK CARE
OF, OR PREVENTED THEM, FROM
CHARGING CERTAIN FEES THAT AGAIN
IN THE LONG RUN WOULD AMOUNT TO
A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT, THAT YOU
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RETIRE WITH
AS MUCH AS YOU COULD HAD YOU
KNOWN WHAT WAS AT PLAY BEHIND
THE SCENES.
SO IT WAS PROVIDING
OVERSIGHT, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY
IT WAS PROVIDING INFORMATION TO
THE CONSUMER SO YOU KNEW WHAT
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WERE AT
PLAY AND THE TYPES OF FEES
YOU WERE BEING CHARGED.
SO THIS IS CRAZY.
I KEEP THINKING THE WHOLE
POINT OF GOVERNMENT IS TO
PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE
DUPLICITOUS -- THIS ISN'T JUST
DUPLICITOUS, IT'S CRIMINAL, IT'S
THE POTENTIAL TO SORT OF GRIFT
--
BUT EVEN IF IT'S JUST
DUPLICITOUS --
MY PARENTS WERE BOTH DOCTORS,
IF A DOCTOR COULD BE LIKE I'M
GOING TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT
MIGHT KILL YOU AND NOT TELL YOU
THAT IF IT WILL MAKE THE
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY A LOT OF
PROFIT -- WELL, THAT'S KIND OF
HAPPENING.
WE USED TO HAVE A LOT OF LAWS
PERTAINING TO CONSUMERS, LIKE A
LEMON LAW, A CAR SALESMAN
COULDN'T SELL YOU A CAR THAT HE
KNEW DIDN'T FUNCTION.
AND THAT'S
JUST A CAR.
BUT YOU COULD LOSE
YOUR WHOLE SAVINGS AND CORPORATE
JUDGES VIEW IT AS WHOLLY
UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT THEY
TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT IT.
ONE
OF THE THINGS THEY DO THAT ANA
WAS REFERRING TO IS EXCESSIVE
TRADING, THEY TAKE COMMISSION ON
EACH TRADE, FOREIGN SAMPLE, AND
EVERY TIME YOU LOSE THAT MONEY
AND THEY GAIN THAT MONEY.
SO
THEY HAVE RIGGED THAT SYSTEM SO
THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THANK YOU FOR INVESTING FOR US,
WE NOW HAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOU
DON'T. NOT THE WHOLE PRINCIPAL,
A OBVIOUSLY, BUT IT'S A WAY OF
MILKING YOU FOR THEIR PROFIT
WITHOUT TELLING YOU. AND IF WE
CAN HAVE A LEMON LAW ABOUT CARS
YOU CAN CERTAINLY HAVE IT ABOUT
YOUR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS AND
YOUR ENTIRE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.
THING ABOUT WHO THEY PREY ON.
THEY PREY ON RETIREES.
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST
VULNERABLE, IN SOME CASES MOST
GULLIBLE BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AS
COMFORTABLE WITH THESE THINGS,
I'M GENERALIZING BUT THAT'S
TRUE, ONE THING TO POINT OUT,
ANA, BEFORE YOU GO ON, IS THIS
IS THE FIFTH CIRCUIT, IT'S A 2-1
DECISION, EARLIER THIS WEEK THEY
GAVE ANOTHER 2-1 DECISION IN
FAVOR OF TEXAS AGAINST SANCTUARY
CITIES.
SO YOU AREN'T IN THE
NINTH DISTRICT ANYMORE, YOU
AREN'T IN THIS FAVORABLE COURT,
BUT THESE ARE BOTH 2-1
DECISIONS.
IN THE SANCTUARY
CITIES CASE IN TEXAS THEY WILL
APPEAL FOR A HEARING WITH ALL
SEVEN MEMBERS, OR NINE MEMBERS,
OF AN APPEALS COURT AND THEY
PROBABLY WILL WANT TO DO THAT IN
THIS CASE AS WELL BECAUSE THIS
IS WHAT YOU HAVE WITH THE
CIRCUIT APPEALS COURTS, WHEN
THEY KNOW THEY CAN GET A GOOD
DECISION THEY GET A SMALLER
NUMBER, THEY GO TO A 2-1.
TWO THINGS I WANT TO POINT
OUT, ONE IN REGARD TO WHAT CENK
MENTIONED, THE CONSTANT TRADING
IS SOME THING THAT IS PUSHED
TOWARDS CONSUMERS, THEY ARE
REFERRED TO AS ACTIVE MANAGEMENT
OR ACTIVE FUNDS OR ANNUITIES,
AND THE WHOLE POINT IS SO THEY
DO CONSTANT TRADING, AND AGAIN
THAT'S WHEN THE INDIVIDUALS
DOING THE TRAINING ON YOUR
BEHALF MAKE MONEY BUT IT DOESN'T
NECESSARILY WORK TOWARD YOUR
BEST INTERESTS, OR IN YOUR BEST
INTERESTS, BECAUSE YOU WILL
LIKELY LOSE MONEY WHEN THERE IS
THAT MUCH ACTIVITY GOING ON.
TO
YOUR POINT, MICHAEL, SOMETHING
INTERESTING DID HAPPEN.
NOW EVEN
THOUGH THIS COURT RULED AGAINST
THE REGULATIONS, ANOTHER CIRCUIT
COURT ALSO MADE A DECISION ON
THIS REGULATION THAT WAS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, SO THIS IS
LIKELY TO GO TO THE SUPREME
COURT, WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY
GOOD NEWS CONSIDERING WE HAVE A
CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT
CURRENTLY.
ANOTHER CIRCUIT COURT
DECISION HAS TAKEN AN OPPOSITE
TRACK, MEANING THE CONTINUING
FIGHT COULD BE HEADED TO THE
SUPREME COURT.
ANOTHER PIECE OF
INFO YOU SHOULD KNOW IS THAT THE
SEC IS TRYING TO DRAFT ITS OWN
VERSION OF REGULATION IN
RESPONSE TO THIS --
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE A
VERSION OF THAT REGULATION AT
THE MOMENT, BUT WE'LL SEE HOW
THAT TURNS OUT.
IN FULL DISCLOSURE, EDITH
JONES, THE JUDGE, NO RELATION.
SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO RECUSE
YOURSELF.
BECAUSE WE TAKE OUR
ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES VERY
SERIOUSLY.
ONE LAST THING, THOSE
WORDS SHE USED, EDITH JONES
USED, REALLY STRUCK ME. AND
AGAIN IT GOES TO THE HEART OF
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM.
SHE DEEMED THE ATTEMPT TO
PROTECT CONSUMERS AS ARBITRARY
AND CAPRICIOUS.
LIKE, ALMOST A
SLAP IN THE FACE, SAYING HOW
DARE YOU TRY TO STAND UP FOR THE
CITIZENS?
NO, THE CORPORATIONS
RULE US ALL AND THEY CAN DO
ANYTHING THEY LIKE, THEY CAN
TRICK YOU, TAKE YOUR MONEY, LIE
TO YOU, AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU
CAN DO ABOUT IT, AND IF THE
GOVERNMENT TRIES TO STAND UP FOR
YOU, IN THE RARE CASE IT TRIES
TO STAND UP FOR YOU, WE WILL
DEEM IT ARBITRARY AND
CAPRICIOUS.
HOW DARE THEY?
