1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,800
Cricket superstar.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,889
Playboy.

3
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:03,980
Politician.

4
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,620
Imran Khan has been called many things.

5
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,800
But now he’s earned a new title: Prime Minister.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,780
Imran Khan, was officially declared the winner
of Pakistan’s highly contested the July,

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,619
2018 election, despite opposition parties’
persistent demands for a recount.

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,080
But how did this former sports star end up
securing the highest political position in

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,869
a country of almost 200 million people?

10
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:32,210
I’m Alex, this is NowThis World, and in
light of Imran Khan’s recent political triumph,

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,530
we’re taking a look at his rise to power.

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,100
Let’s rewind to March 1992.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,980
Khan, then-captain of the Pakistan national
cricket team led his team to an unprecedented

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,179
victory for the country.

15
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:49,469
It was Pakistan’s first and only World Cup
win to date - and a moment of extreme pride

16
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:50,469
for its citizens.

17
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:55,429
Khan, who was already a celebrated cricketer
throughout the ‘70s and ‘80s, saw his

18
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:58,120
celebrity status skyrocket even further.

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,260
Beloved both at home and in the West, he had
an active and public social and love life

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,720
- his marriage to British heiress in 1995
making international news.

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,150
Media outlets hailed him a “playboy,”
and “sex symbol.”

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,170
But he endeavoured to shed this image for
that of a more conservative and pious Figure.

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,460
Some experts suggested this came as part of
his desire to be taken more seriously in the

24
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,430
political arena down the line.

25
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,210
But first, the made headlines as a philanthropist,
fundraising millions of dollars to open a

26
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,700
cancer hospital for low-income patients in
honor of his late mother in December, 1994.

27
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,060
It was around this time - a few years after
the World Cup victory - that speculation about

28
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,870
Khan’s leadership potential started popping
up, and it was rumored was he was setting

29
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,540
his sights on a political career.

30
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,470
"If I felt that by going into politics I would
be able to help my country I certainly would.

31
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,890
But the fact is in Pakistan politics is completely
corrupt.

32
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,350
Soon he would outline what would become his
core issue for 22 years: ridding Pakistani

33
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,590
politics of corruption.

34
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:10,000
And in 1996, he made it official: founding
the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI party.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,940
Also referred to as the “Movement for Justice,”
the party was branded as an anti-corruption,

36
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,680
socio-political movement, aiming to create
a quote “self-reliant modern Islamic Republic.”

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,190
But for almost two decades, Khan’s party
saw few victories.

38
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,900
“He did not become an instant political
star and I think the reason for that is he

39
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:35,630
was unwilling to go the route that most politicians
in Pakistan do, and that’s to sort of try

40
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,920
to draw on the most powerful people in the
country like the army and other powerful players

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,190
and have them help him.”

42
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,960
In their first general election contest in
1997, the PTI didn’t win a single parliamentary

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
seat.

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,130
The 2002 election was also a relative failure,
with Khan winning just one seat.

45
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,850
These defeats earned him a nickname among
his critics: “Imran Khan’t.”

46
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,850
But he kept pushing.

47
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:04,760
In 2007, he even took his anti-corruption
convictions so far as to lead a student protest

48
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,740
over the authoritarian crackdown by then-military
ruler and President General Pervez Musharraf,

49
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,840
for which he was arrested.

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,260
In jail, he went on a hunger strike as a further
act of protest.

51
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,170
“The only way you fight extremism and radicalisation
is having a genuine democratic system, this

52
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,080
is not the way by using your army."

53
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,760
His PTI party would boycott the ‘08 elections
over the lack of an independent judiciary.

54
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,959
And Khan’s predisposition to blaze his own
trail would continue to lead him to take some

55
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,010
pretty controversial stances.

56
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,980
Some critics accused him of failing to firmly
crack down on violent extremist groups - even

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,569
dubbing him with the nickname “Taliban Khan.”

58
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:49,560
Though Khan has largely condemned violent
terrorist attacks, critics argue that he’s

59
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,180
at times acted as an apologist for groups
like the Tablian: blaming the group’s presence

60
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,459
in Pakistan on U.S. intervention in Afghanistan
and urging negotiations with them.

61
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,060
"If there was a chance of peace talks, we
should've grabbed it.”

62
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,750
Critics also say he’s failed to adequately
support Pakistan’s persecuted religious

63
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,910
minorities by strongly defending the country’s
blasphemy laws.

64
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,520
These laws - the foundation of which were
first introduced under British colonial rule

65
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,129
- criminalize derogatory remarks against the
interpretation of Islam sanctioned by the

66
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,129
government.

67
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:26,240
Muslim minority groups in Pakistan, like Ahmadis
and Shias, as well as Hindu and Christian

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,060
Pakistanis, have been disproportionately persecuted
under these laws.

69
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,039
Since the ‘90s, dozens of people have been
murdered after being accused of blasphemy,

70
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,759
and others sit on death row over legal provisions.

71
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,059
The PTI has pushed back on this criticism-
saying Kahn has “repeatedly educated the

72
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:46,159
masses on tolerance for minorities in Islam.”

73
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:51,491
He did stand up for religious minorities in
certain instances, including in 2013 when

74
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,949
a Christian colony was gutted by a mob over
alleged blasphemy.

75
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:00,651
But Khan has said the laws are not to blame
for the deaths, and reiterated his strong

76
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:15,060
support for them just weeks before the latest
election.

77
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,529
Despite his ongoing contentions, 2013 ended
up being his party’s most successful year

78
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:20,919
up to that point.

79
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:26,729
The PTI won 27 seats - still not a major victory,
but a step in the right direction for the

80
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:27,729
party.

81
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:32,189
Of course, as he spent more time in the political
spotlight, controversies continued.

82
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:38,020
As recently as 2017 and 2018, sexual harassment
allegations emerged against him, which Khan

83
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,169
has ignored or denied altogether.

84
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:49,720
"Sports teaches you that life is not in a
straight line, ups and downs.

85
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:58,900
You take your knock, then each time you pick
yourself up from the mat, then you are successful.”

86
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,939
He vowed to lift millions of people out of
poverty, create jobs, and to improve access

87
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,949
to education and healthcare.

88
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:10,080
He also doubled down on calls to root out
corruption and a promise to challenge the

89
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,400
status quo.

90
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,710
“they really see [Khan] as the guy that
can tackle corruption, just because he’s

91
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,999
not one of “them” so to speak - he doesn’t
come from the corrupt political class, he’s

92
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:43,249
not the product of a family dynasty, he doesn’t
come from one of the two major political parties.”

93
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:48,629
Experts say his anti-corruption, anti-elitism,
anti-poverty campaigning really resonated

94
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:50,490
with young, middle-class, urban voters.

95
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:56,509
As of late 2017, people under the age of 35
accounted for almost half of the country’s

96
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:58,130
registered voters.

97
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:05,979
And in July 2018, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf
party won 115 out of 270 available seats.

98
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:10,039
He had finally achieved of a goal that was
more than two decades in the works.

99
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:21,619
There was mass celebration in 

100
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,879
the streets.

101
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:30,659
But later, it would be followed by protest,
amid speculation that the powerful military

102
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,719
may have played a heavy hand in getting Kahn
elected - including potentially playing a

103
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:39,059
role in the 2017 ousting of then-Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif.

104
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:43,439
The expert we spoke to says Khan’s relationship
with the military will be one of the single

105
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,990
most important determining factors in how
successful his government will be.

106
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,419
Khan may have a tough road ahead.

107
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:54,809
He is also inheriting a looming debt and currency
crisis, and strained relations with the U.S.,

108
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,319
Afghanistan, and India.

109
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,619
Addressing those issues - coupled with his
long-held promise to curb corruption - make

110
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:02,129
for one tall order.

111
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,020
So, can he get it done?

112
00:08:04,020 --> 00:00:00,000
Certainly, his supporters have high hopes.
