I thought you were the guy to talk to because this new proposal by the European Union called article 13 there may be some noble public policy goal underneath it to reward content creators with the fruits of their labor I get that as a content creator I bet you do too but it sounds like it could be abused to go after anyone who posts a funny image like it could be writ large the same malicious prosecution you underwent for your YouTube video that that could theoretically happen to anyone who shares something on Facebook or Twitter am i overstating things well at the moment the saying that it's going to be used for copyright but I guarantee you in the future there's going to be useful things like speech you know if something is a offensive onion or even if it's just a joke that's a little bit too edgy then things like bar they're going to be subject to these exact same restrictions right now it's starting to copulate by promise you in the next few years it's just going to be used for all kinds of speech that they don't approve of you know one way of looking at it is that anyone on the internet almost no matter what you say or do would break this rule so we're all guilty under this rule and then it just comes down to who do they choose to charge because every one of us retweets or share something on facebook so as you say who they go after eventually of course it will be a political tool of course it'll be a censorship tool even if it doesn't start off that way because that's the way to get anyone isn't it well there's a way of doing it as well as it's not going to be the end user like me is no going to be the user but it's going to be the platforms that get punished so basically even if we get angry about content being removed we're going to be screaming and screeching at the platforms when it's not actually their fault they just have to comply with this legislation so basically it's the EU that have done it by it's the platform's themselves that I'm going to get the brunt of the blame when you say the platform is you referring to you too and Twitter and Facebook the places that these electronic digital town squares as I've heard others refer to them that's that's a phrase that Jack Dorsey of Twitter uses I think though you're right it's the government behind it but I think that the companies are only too happy to do the bidding of governments I think there's a lot of log rolling a lot of favors exchanged YouTube Facebook Twitter that do a favor for the government and then return the government maybe goes easy on them for their tax structures for for other things I mean I I sense that while these companies claim to be independent they actually love doing business with governments especially authoritarian governments see they see the EU itself the legislation that gets probably little proposed to the EU comes from bag tech bank operations and lobbying groups that are sponsored by them basically if any of these big corporations want legislation to get picked through then they can go forward and propose it and it will get picked through because and I think that big tech obviously may end up needing appear famous alkalinity adopt I'll get others and spend some money to police the platform's better but in the long term that they won because small companies aren't subject to the legislation but when they reach a certain size then they are subject to the legislation which means that they'll either you know beneath the adopt algorithms that literally is Norway to hire enough staff to monitor the sheer amount of content that gets posted online so all that happens as small companies need to stay small so they're not subject to the regulations because they simply can't afford to abide by them or they try and end up just getting completely buried financially which means that the big tech that I'll at the top their place is no secure you know they will take a little bit of a hack monetarily but in the long run they benefit because no one's going to be able to compete with them no that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra Levant show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my now to subscribe go to the rebel da media / shows you
