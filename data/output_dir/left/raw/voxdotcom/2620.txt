1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:06,799
There have been nearly 5000 fires in California
since the start of 2018.

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,600
The fire season has been dominating the news.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,960
“This has turned into another record-setting
fire season.”

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,260
“Now the largest in state history.”

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,920
“Really there’s no end in sight."

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,860
It’s hot.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,860
It’s dry.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,920
It’s windy.

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,440
Just about everything on the ground is flammable.

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:28,110
But there’s one thing that’s consistently
making wildfires in California worse and

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,240
worse and worse:

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,180
Us.

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,830
At this point, even calling them “wild” fires
might be a misnomer, because most of them

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:44,710
are not natural. Humans are responsible
for starting a whopping 84% of them.

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,230
The northern California Carr fire for example,
was started by sparks from a car tire' rim.

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:57,140
And in southern California, the Holy Fire just outside of
LA started after a suspected arson.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,700
These are just two of the fires currently
active in the state.

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,660
So far in 2018 629,000 acres have burned.

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,340
That’s nearly 3 times as much compared to
the same time period in 2017.

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:19,660
What makes these fires so dangerous, damaging,
and therefore costly is that more human-made

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,720
infrastructure is getting caught in the flames.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,060
This map highlights the parts of California
most prone to fires, and it’s no surprise

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,869
that — yeah — that’s where these fires
are.

24
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:31,439
But compare it to

25
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,470
this map, which shows population density growth
projections.

26
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,400
Put them together, and it’s clear:

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,880
California’s population is growing out from urban centers

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,369
directly into the areas

29
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,229
at the highest risk for fire.

30
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,830
Meanwhile, the state is spending more and more
to fight fires each year,

31
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,990
as more people move into areas that put them
in harm’s way.

32
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,960
“It’s up to all of us to protect and preserve
the forests we have.”

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,400
So, since we made this mess worse, what can
we do?

34
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,960
“‘That’s a good job!’

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,720
said Smokey the Bear.”

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,609
Being mindful of how we spark these fires
is a good start,

37
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:16,049
but the bigger problems contributing to this
— like man-made climate change — are unlikely

38
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,379
to reverse.

39
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,139
And despite the risks, humans keep moving
into these areas.

40
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:23,609
“Fires creeping real real close to
some residences up here.”

41
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:32,880
"By 2050 another 645,000 houses will be built at areas at very high risk for wildfires."

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,040
We have the opportunity to get out of the
way of wildfires, and let nature run its course.

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,559
But will we?

44
00:02:42,440 --> 00:00:00,000
“Only YOU can prevent forest fires.”
