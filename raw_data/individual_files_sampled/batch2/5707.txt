good evening from New York I'm Chris Hayes almost every day we see new evidence that members of the president's inner circle have been willing to auction off American foreign policy of the highest bidder and that might be more than anything the story of the corruption of this presidency more even than the mulliner investigation which of course keeps expanding in different directions growing more and more complicated so complicated that it's no surprise so many people seem to have lost the plot according to a new report 59% of Americans say the investigation has yet to uncover any crimes which could not be further from the truth in fact in a little more than a year the special counsel has already secured 19 indictments and five guilty pleas two of which were entered by the president's former national security adviser and Deppe campaign chairman both now cooperating witnesses the campaign of the President of the United States including some of its most senior members was staffed with criminals that is a fact the basic outline of the Trump Russia story hasn't changed we know that Russia sabotage the 2016 election to help put Donald Trump in office we know the president and his campaign openly welcomed and solicited that help they didn't care who it came from what we don't know is whether they actually broke any laws in the process but here's the really crazy thing and the thing that's hard to understand as it happens right in front of our face the Russia story is turning out it appears to be just a small piece of what is now emerging as the major all-encompassing scandal of the Trump administration everywhere you look people close to the president eager to sell out American interests to any foreign national ready with a check or a promise it's the precise opposite of what this president promised on the day he took up the oath of office we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first from this day forward it's going to be only America first America first except not so much because it's quite clear now that many cases America came in second to the interests of the president his associates his national security advisor Michael Flynn was secretly being paid by Turkey during the campaign and into their transition pushing for more favorable policy turns the Turkish strongman in an op-ed he published on election day Paul Manafort the president's former campaign Chairman running the campaign a certain point was deeply entangled with russian-ukrainian turists which he apparently tried to appease by leveraging his role running a presidential campaign quoting an email of his how do we use to get hold the president's longtime lawyer and business associate one of his closest advisers Michael Cohen was reportedly pitching the government of Qatar trump tower during the transition soliciting a million dollar payment in exchange for access to the new administration turns out the president's own son Donald Trump jr. wasn't just interested in what Russia could do for the campaign we now know he also met with an Israeli and emissary for the Saudi government the United Arab Emirates in the months before the election and these are just the instances we know about what's publicly come to light today we learned of what looks like looks like yet another example the president's inner circle selling off US foreign policy BBC reporting citing sources in Kiev close to those involved the president of Ukraine secretly funneled four hundred thousand dollars to Michael Cohen to arrange a meeting at the White House Cohen and the Ukrainian president both deny the report it has not been confirmed by NBC News but we do know the last summer the Ukrainians got their meeting in the Oval Office after it was added to the president's schedule the night before thank you very much it's a great honor to be with President poroshenko of the Ukraine a place that we've all been very much involved in and you've been seeing it and everybody's been reading about it hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
