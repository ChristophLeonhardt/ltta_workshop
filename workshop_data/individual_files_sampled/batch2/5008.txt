let's take you through how President Trump handled things at the g77 summit early on in the summit the president say signals that the other six members of the group needed the US and not the other way around Trump left late for the summit on Friday landing an hour behind schedule when asked type why he was late one White House official told NBC News quote he's the president there's a lot on his plate and he was delayed he again showed up late to a session the next day this time twenty minutes late for breakfast discussion on gender equality but before he left the summit early for Singapore he chose to praise his fellow g7 leaders I would say that the level of relationship is attend we have a great relationship Angela and Emmanuel and Justin I would say the relationship is at ten but before his departure President Trump took to Twitter to criticize Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over his remarks on a joint communique between the g7 members quote based on Justin's false statements at his news conference and the fact that Canada is charging massive tariffs to our US farmers workers and companies I have instructed our US reps not to endorse the communique as we look at tariffs and automobiles and flooding the US market Trump continued p.m. trust in Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our g7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that US tariffs were kind of insulting and he will not be pushed around very dishonest and weak our tariffs are in response to his two hundred and seventy percent Andheri and here are some of what the president's economic trade advisors said yesterday he really kind of stabbed this in the back he really actually you know what he did a great disservice to the whole g7 he betrayed oh dude yes he did because they were united in the g7 so they had this bilateral meeting we were very close to making a deal with Canada on NAFTA bilaterally perhaps and then we leave and Trudeau pulls this sophomoric political stunt for domestic consumption there's a special place in the hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door and that's what bad faith Justin Trudeau did with that stunt press conference that's what weak dishonest Justin Trudeau did and that comes right from Air Force One this is what he actually said yeah I'm happy to announce that we've released a joint communique by all seven countries we had some strong firm conversations on trade and specifically American tariffs I reiterated to President Trump that these terrorists threatened to harm industry and workers on both sides of our border I stand ready to work closely with the President to resolve this dispute swiftly but as I have consistently said I will always protect Canadian workers and Canadian interests those very mild Gene Robinson good god only Donald J Trump would make me defend Justin Trudeau second he is getting on the world stage with a phony boxing match I could go down the litany going to Donald J Trump is going to now make me defend Justin Trudeau this is this is it's not easy for me but it's so sound weirdly that there's something there is something there's something now here there's something personal I don't know what he was calling him meek and weak and so he does that when he's feeling insecure when Trump is feeling a cure and so is it it's youth is he is the fact that I'm told it's a pretty good-looking guy you know oh no I did something something about him drives Trump crazy but speaking of crazy think just how insane this is I mean how how insane and amateurish this this whole thing is first Trump you know goes berserk about this mild statement the Trudeau made and then his advisers go out using language that's usually reserved for you know you know special place in hell and and they there's this this idea they voice that well you know Trudeau made him try to make him look bad and going on no he didn't and be that's like negotiations over the North Korean nuclear program or how does a slightly more sophisticated level you think that North Koreans are you know are going to say oh well you know just because right here Oh went after Trump you know we're thing Trudeau didn't go after Trump and in response and of this where Trudeau doesn't even go after Trump he says I'll defend Canada so to everybody says Larry Cutler says he stabbed us in the back and then Navarro like he betrayed us there's a special place in hell for somebody saying they're going to defend Canada Trudeau's remarks were not even tough why is Donald Trump acting like a snowflake on the international stage why is he the ultimate snowflake melting away when Justin Trudeau gives a blandly Canadian hey what's this about I mean he was being kind he was for it is eminently reasonable from the perspective of how these sorts of negotiations are typically conducted typically leaders understand each of them are under their own set of domestic political pressures they tried to both you know come together on shared goals for the international community while respecting you know the the realities for the other leaders they just absolutely blew through that and and I have to say that that interview with Peter Navarro that is the one thing I have heard from sources about in particular that there is a special place in hell for the person who is arguably our closest allies certainly our closest neighbor I mean that's not how we typically talk about I mean often times we don't even use language that's strong against you know dictator Saddam Hussein other people that's what max max boot was talking about that yesterday said we we only use language like that before we're going to war I can't stop I can't stop thinking about this interview unless I'm missing something these are the most hostile comments in the US officials made by the US ally ever this is tougher then the way US presidents talked about leaders like Saddam Hussein and Bashar Assad before we found them Alex go back I want to go to Bob Costas next would go back play this Justin Trudeau clip again and let's try to sort through this and see what exactly made Donald Trump melt like a snowflake in the middle of the blistering like like a snowflake in the Las Vegas Sun in August I don't get this I'm happy to announce that we've released a joint communique by all seven countries we had some strong firm conversations on trade and specifically American tariffs I reiterated to President Trump that these tariffs threatened to harm industry and workers on both sides of our border I stand ready to work closely with the president to resolve this dispute swiftly but as I have consistently said I will always protect Canadian workers and Canadian interests well I don't even so I don't even know what to say that was one of the Politis statements again the question is what do you have any insight into why Donald Trump they're so weak when it comes to Justin Trudeau why why he would melt like that on the international stage and cause well cause a serious rupture in one of our most reporting of important relationships across the globe while the Prime Minister had a polite tone it's worth noting that he is fighting back against US tariffs he's announced his own counter tariffs about 13 billion on us goods so you see the Canadians not just taking the president's line on trade and accepting where President Trump is moving on trade and with regard to mr. Navarro and mr. Cutler their hardline comments you really can almost feel the shadow of President Trump hovering over them while they're on television anyone who has worked for this president says he is entirely transactional and his ideology is fluid except on trade that trade since the 1970s has animated him and that you cannot convince him privately to budge and so this trade ideology that this really is not shared by any one right or left inside of the halls of the US Capitol it's really president Trump's own ideology this is now driving all US policy especially with regard to our Western allies and Michael as still doesn't say you know you talk about Ken well I mean we're talking about Canada and you know we've always always heard historians say that America's greatness it was assured in part by the fact that we were protected from our enemies by two oceans sure but it's worth noting this morning that we were also blessed with an extraordinary neighbor to the north and we have the longest I guess it's the longest demilitarized border in the world between the United States and Canada we sure do at a time that people talk about borders especially Donald Trump we don't have a closer ally this has been for 200 years this has been a huge strength of America you know when we were in 9/11 and Pearl Harbor you know Canada was always there and God willing always will be and the thing that really worries me is the emotionalism of this I totally grabbed what Bob said about Donald Trump's feeling about it trade but those words yesterday did not come with his abstract views on trade it's this emotional reaction he has to Justin Trudeau maybe it's that Justin Trudeau goes to g7 and he's the darling of a lot of those other leaders in a way that Donald Trump is not and that makes his feelings hurt but the problem is you know at 8:00 p.m. this evening Eastern Time he's gonna go in that room one-on-one with only translators with the leader of North Korea all of our security depends on that the same thing with our children all of America and is he going to have the same emotionalism so I want to hear from Jeremy and the Admiral on this tweet Richard Haass tweeted this analysis the unraveling of the g7 summit works in North Korea's favor as president Trump will not want to bust up two summits in a row lest people conclude he is the problem increases incentive for Kim to up his asks and limit his compromises and for Trump to do the opposite hardly the ideal context Jeremy yeah Canada the g7 was an epic foreign policy fail I mean it was an easy layup missed by the United States and to go back to something Joe that you said earlier this was really volodymyr tans playbook I mean not only would he want to be in the g7 or g8 but actually what he wants more than that is to fracture the West and that's exactly the outcome of the g7 and so I think the United States goes into this some with North Korea with our traditional alliances fractured and as noted earlier if we're going to ensure that American national security interests are protected in the asia-pacific region and around the world we're going to need allies and admirals for Vitas does Vladimir Putin have a more pressing strategic goal than the breakup of the NATO alliance and the breakup of the g7 if if Vladimir Putin did let's say have something undaunted Trump and Donald Trump were to carry out Vladimir Putin's top geopolitical strategic goal would it not look exactly like what happened this weekend it absolutely would Joe and two quick points going back to Canada for a minute we ought to remember that we actually have a trade surplus with Canada and also that we have higher tariffs than the Canadians do so you go back to what are the explanations here now I'm loathe to comment on Justin Trudeau's appearance because people stopped me in the airport a lot and say you know you look a lot like Justin Trudeau I can understand that frustration that the president may have but you know is the NATO commander i watch Canadian troops died in Afghanistan a lot I watched their jets with us in Libya Afghanistan Iraq just so in explicable and then to the summit I'm just gonna take Jeremy's point and Richards excellent point and add another thought which is it's not just Russia this really plays in favor of China who is seeking to dominate that region and by walking us away from our allies what do you think the Japanese and the Australians and our Pacific allies think when they watch how Donald Trump treats our European allies they see where this thing is headed you almost feel like the talking points got mixed up in terms of being nice to the allies be Stern with North Korea it's kind of like a flip it's it's bad economics it's bad geopolitics it's bad atmospherics and it is going to put us in a tougher position going forward than anything else I can think of our greatest strengths of these alliance systems well and again we can thank you so much Admiral greatly appreciated as shameless as the Republicans on Capitol Hill have been I find it hard to believe that anybody today will come out and defend what Donald Trump did attacking Canada Peter Navarro did and so did Kudlow they work for Donald Trump I just wonder whether any Republicans we foolish enough did say it was a great idea attacking our closest allies when there's no strategic benefit to it whatsoever good joke do you think any Republicans are going to come out on the other side actually clear and loud voice say this was nuts this is not represent suspects other than McCain Susan Susan Collins it's still a short list and they're obviously also already being criticized for hey okay you can say those things what are you actually gonna do about it and you know one thing that it has gone on in the Senate there is real I mean come on the Republican Party does not agree with the policy of this forget the personality and the dramatics and how you know badly the president personally treated our allies they fundamentally ideologically disagree with him and they're not going to move forward on anything because they don't want to make Donald you know make him angry in an election cannot speak for what the Congress would have done while Barack Obama was president and you mark my words if Bill Clinton had done this during the nineteen months I we would have we would have articles of impeachment up immediately and they would be there'd be investigations every committee would be investigating the connection between he has deals between Russia and the United States between your Clinton and the leader of Russia it's just again this is Bob Costas this is sad terrible unprecedented and I cannot believe that now they sit there while Donald Trump destroys or aligned but you have to believe it because when you talk to lawmakers Republicans they say with the North Korea summit happening they're not going to start speaking out against their own president on foreign policy that but the most interesting thing it's not the scene in Canada it was the scene in Beijing last week as we talk about World Order who was in Beijing last week Vladimir Putin even a Chinese the Russians as the West is fighting amongst each other accepting a prize to from the Chinese exactly right and that was the playbook that but they were but Jeremy bash and the Admiral were both talking about Donald Trump could not be doing you know a greater favor to Vladimir Putin than what he's doing right now how fascinating and there was a lot more ahead on Morning Joe we're gonna go live to Singapore where NBC's Andrea Mitchell was in the room as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo answered questions she gives us a full debrief straight ahead plus Bob Muller charges the 20th person in
