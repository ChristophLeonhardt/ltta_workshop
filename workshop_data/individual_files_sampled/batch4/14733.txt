aside from being a shameless exhibitionist why would anyone want to ride a bicycle through city streets clad only in their birthday suit well it's the protest Big Oil of course yeah the same commodity that makes the bicycle industry even possible to begin with in the pop culture realm when I think of naked bike riding I tend to think of the music video for the Queen toon bicycle race those beautiful fat bottomed girls indeed but why is it that in real life the participants in a naked bike ride look more like this yeah I think the problem is glaringly evident way too little TNA and way too much sausagefest that footage also provides grist for the mill when it comes to the old adage of why is it that those who embrace nudism tend to be the very people you don't want to see naked in any event on the same day that be unlawful and odious and anti-semitic alkyds rally was taking place the illegal naked bike ride played out you see because Toronto was a city presided over by a milquetoast mayor naked bicycle riders were not only allowed free rein on city streets but were actually given a police escort hey bike lives matter I suppose luckily the Toronto Sun's Joe Warmington was on the scene to cover those uncovered bike riders and like all good reporters Joe was quick to ask the most relevant of the five W's why and here's what the organizer Jean Dare had to say quote we are protesting oil and cooked oh you mean the oil that was needed to forge all that steel and aluminum and carbon fiber and rubber and plastic into bicycles you mean the oil that was required to fuel the freighters that bring these bikes from China that oil and another thing when it's a balmy June day in Toronto a naked bike ride makes for a jolly endeavor to be sure but you don't see naked Bight rides in this neck of the woods in January when it's minus 25 with the wind chill but then again methinks I'm drilling too deep here for really what does logic have to do with a naked bike ride to begin with for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rubble with you wherever you go you
