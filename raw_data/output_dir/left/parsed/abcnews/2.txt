>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
NOW REPORTING, TOM LLAMAS.
>>> GOOD MORNING, WE'RE 
FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS OUT OF 
THE WHITE HOUSE THIS MORNING 
WHERE ABC NEWS HAS JUST LEARNED 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS JUST 
ACCEPTED THE RESIGNATION OF HIS 
U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY SET 
TO TAKE PLACE AT THE END OF THE 
YEAR.
BOTH THE RESIGNATION AND TIMING 
COMING AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE TO
BOTH FOREIGN POLICY OFFICIALS 
AND LEADERS ACROSS WASHINGTON.
AMBASSADOR HALEY KNOWN AS 
SOMEONE WHO HAD A STRONG AND 
RESPECTFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
PRESIDENT, SHE HAS SAID PUBLICLY
IN THE PAST SHE WAS NOT AFRAID 
TO LET THE PRESIDENT KNOW WHEN 
SHE DISAGREED WITH HIM.
RECENTLY IN RESPONSE TO THAT 
ANONYMOUS OP-ED IN "THE NEW YORK
TIMES" SHE CHALLENGED THE SOURCE
SAYING THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT 
SHUT OUT HIS ADVISERS AND SHE 
AND OTHERS HAVE OPEN ACCESS TO 
THE PRESIDENT.
OUR SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT CECILIA VEGA HAS A
READOUT OF WHAT HAS JUST 
HAPPENED INSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE.
>> YOU KNOW, THIS JUST HAPPENED 
AND REPORTERS WERE NOT SUPPOSED 
TO BE IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
THEY WERE CALLED IN SPECIFICALLY
FOR THIS AND INSIDE THE 
PRESIDENT WAS THERE WITH U.N. 
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY SO THIS 
IS WHAT WE KNOW.
THE PRESIDENT SAYS SHE CALLED 
HIM SIX MONTHS AGO AND TOLD HIM 
SHE WANTED OFF OF THIS JOB.
HE SAYS HE'S SORRY TO LOSE HER, 
SEEMS LIKE, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE 
STILL VERY MUCH GOOD FRIENDS AND
SAYS HE CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT 
NIKKI HALEY.
SHE WILL BE LEAVING AS YOU 
MENTIONED AT THE END OF THE 
YEAR.
REPORTERS IN THE ROOM ASKED 
NIKKI HALEY IF SHE PLANS TO RUN 
IN 2020 AND SHE SAID SHE DOES 
NOT, IN FACT, SHE SAID SHE WILL 
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS 
RE-ELECTION BID.
SO THIS COMES AS A HUGE 
SURPRISE, TOM, I JUST WANT TO 
HIT ON THE TIMING OF THIS.
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHY SHE IS 
LEAVING OR WHAT HER EXPLANATION 
IS FOR OFFERING THIS RESIGNATION
TO THE PRESIDENT TODAY OR SIX 
MONTHS AGO IF HE SAYS THIS 
HAPPENED.
LET'S MARK WHAT TODAY IS.
TODAY IS THE DAY WHERE PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING A 
VICTORY LAP IN THE WAKE OF HIS 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, BEING CONFIRMED AND 
SWORN IN YESTERDAY BY HIM RIGHT 
HERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THIS
IS A DAY WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
IS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AHEAD 
TO THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND 
RALLYING HIS BASE USING THAT 
KAVANAUGH VICTORY TO RALLY THE 
BASE.
INSTEAD HERE WE ARE WITH A 
SURPRISING STAFF SHAKE-UP THAT 
SEEMS IT CAME FROM THE 
PRESIDENT'S OWN ANNOUNCEMENT AND
REALLY SORT OF A BIG QUESTION AS
TO WHAT REALLY WENT ON HERE 
BEHIND THE SCENES, TOM. 
>> JUST A WEEK AFTER HIS OR TWO 
WEEKS AFTER HIS ADDRESS TO THE 
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
I WANT TO BRING IN GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS NOW.
AMBASSADOR HALEY WAS SOMEONE WHO
COULD TALK TO THE PRESIDENT VERY
FRANKLY, NOT AFRAID TO SPEAK HER
MIND.
AT FIRST THEY HAD SOMEWHAT OF A 
ROCKY RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE SHE 
DIDN'T ENDORSE HIM BUT QUICKLY 
AFTER HE WANTED TO NOMINATE HER 
TO BECOME U.N. AMBASSADOR AN 
PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE. 
>> HE DID.
SHE ALWAYS TOWED THE PARTY LINE 
ON THE IRAN SAFNCTIONS ON NORTH 
KOREA TAKING A HARD LINE BUT 
ALSO SELLING THE PROPOSED DEAL 
AFTER THE PRESIDENT HAD THAT 
SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE.
NOTABLE EXCEPTION ON RUSSIA, 
NIKKI HALEY ALWAYS TOOK A MUCH 
HARDER PUBLIC LINE ON RUSSIA AND
VLADIMIR PUTIN THAN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DID BUT AS YOU NOTE, SHE 
WAS NOT CLOSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
SHE DID NOT ENDORSE HIM UNTIL 
VERY LATE IN THE GAME.
SHE SPOKE OUT AGAINST HIS MORE 
INTEMPERATE COMMENTS AGE SPOKE 
DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT AND 
HOW SHE DIDN'T APPROVE OF THEM 
AFTER CHARLOTTESVILLE SO WASN'T 
AFRAID TO CREATE DISTANCE FROM 
THE PRESIDENT AND EVEN THOUGH 
SHE WAS CAREFUL IN THAT OVAL 
OFFICE NEAR THE PRESIDENT, I 
DON'T THINK THAT WILL STOP HIM 
FROM TALKING ABOUT IT 
PARTICULARLY IF SOMETHING WOULD 
FORCE PRESIDENT TRUMP INTO A 
POSITION WHERE IT SEEMED LIKE 
EITHER HE COULDN'T RUN OR WAS IN
A WEAK POSITION IN 2020. 
>> STILL POPULAR WITH REPUBLICAN
VOTERS.
GEORGE, THANK YOU.
WANT TO BRING IN MARTHA RADDATZ.
MARTHA, QUICKLY, HOW IS THIS 
GOING TO PLAY AROUND THE WORLD?
>> Reporter: WELL, I THINK MANY 
OF OUR ALLIES LOOK TO NIKKI 
HALEY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS 
GOING ON IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
WE, OF COURSE, HAVE HAD A WHITE 
HOUSE THAT PLAYS GOOD COP, BAD 
COP WITH FOREIGN POLICY BUT I 
THINK NIKKI HALEY WAS A CALMING,
BUT VERY STRONG VOICE AND, OF 
COURSE, LOSING A WOMAN RIGHT NOW
IS DIFFICULT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE
AS WELL BECAUSE IT IS 
ASTONISHING BECAUSE THERE HAVE 
BEEN NO LEAKS.
THIS IS A WHITE HOUSE THAT DID 
NOT WANT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT 
RIGHT NOW, SO THIS REALLY DID 
COME OUT OF NOWHERE. 
>> MARTHA RADDATZ AND OUR ENTIRE
TEAM, OUR THANKS TO YOU.
JUST TUNING IN RIGHT NOW, U.N. 
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY 
RESIGNING.
THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCING THIS 
JUST MOMENTS AGO.
IT WILL HAPPEN AT THE END OF THE
YEAR.
WE'LL RETURN TO OUR REGULARING 
PROGRAMMING.
FOR OW VIEWERS IN THE WEST IT'S 
"GOOD MORNING AMERICA."
MORE ON THE STORY THROUGHOUT THE
DAY ON ABC NEWS LIVE AND, OF 
COURSE LATER ON "WORLD NEWS 
TONIGHT."
I'M TOM LLAMAS.
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.

SPECIAL REPO
