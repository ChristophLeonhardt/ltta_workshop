taking more steps in avoiding transparency especially when it comes to Donald Trump's conversations with foreign leaders so according to recent reporting the White House will no longer publish summaries from president Trump's calls with world leaders and there are read about which are historically you know put out by the White House so reporters can kind of keep an eye on what's going on how what these conversations are really about now the phone conversations rarely contain news but are the only proof or record of such a call taking place they are distributed internally and often contain descriptions of what was discussed so this all started to kind of unravel back in mid-june when the White House was you know releasing these readouts that really didn't have much detail at all so the last redoubt was published by the White House on June 16th and contained a vague three sentence summary of Trump's call with the Hungarian prime minister but you know now they've decided yeah we're not gonna do any of these readouts anymore period now this is problematic because oftentimes when there are calls with let's say Trump and a world leader there could be two sides to the story that was the case when Trump had a call with Justin Trudeau in regard to trade negotiations Trump Trump's White House made it seem as though they had this great amicable discussion when in reality well I'm inclined to believe Justin Trudeau but Justin Trudeau claimed that the call was a little more combative so it's hard to get the u.s. is narrative or perspective on these discussions if the White House is refusing to be transparent about it there's another component but Jake I want you to jump in yeah so apparently they call with candidate Trump talked about how Canada burned down the White House which of course they never did when the White House was burned down Canada did not even exist where did he get that because the English came from what is now Canada oh okay oh they control the back then Canada would not exist for another 50 years and the English came down and burned down the White House but so what is he know he doesn't know anything yes so he comes as oh well you know you guys naturally your national security threat that's why I to do tariffs and patrols like national security threat so you can remember where you burned down the White House and Trudeau's like no I don't remember that because I didn't happen great but but that goes to the heart of this story which is he doesn't want you to have the transcript or even summaries because then it was show that he's lying there is absolutely no pushback from Republican lawmakers about this story none zero there's absolutely no Republican pushback about Trump's you know executive power how he flexes executive power how he issues executive orders I mean there was so much controversy about Obama using executive actions they thought that it was it was just the wrong way to go about things but Trump has been doing things unilaterally no pushback from Republicans but to be fair Anna I'm not sure that they that the Republican would have been hypocritical about other things like Trump's Affairs and payoffs to his mistresses if Obama had had multiple affairs while his wife had just given birth and was paying people off during campaigns I'm sure the Republicans would have let it slide oh yeah definitely I mean it's and then of course the you know the Supreme Court issue where they're trying to rush Brett Cavanaugh's confirmation when they did the exact opposite when it came to Merrick garland because it was an election year anyway the list goes on and on but there's another part of this that I really want to discuss because it's just incredible how the White House also tries to alter transcripts and omit certain things that make Donald Trump look bad so for instance when Donald Trump had his joint press conference in Helsinki with Vladimir Putin Vladimir Putin was asked whether or not he wanted Trump to win the election here is the video do you want to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that later yes I did because he talked about bringing the right us-russia relationship back to normal the White House has admitted that Armen has basically taken out that interaction from the official White House transcripts okay it goes to the part of who Donald Trump is both a liar and stupid we already saw the whole world saw it we all have it on tape so he's a no no I got it you just when Putin said he wanted me to win you just take it out of the transcript no I know we've all seen it and maybe I'm I'm wrong but tell me what you think about this perspective I don't think it's about convincing Americans about what's really going on today I think it's about basically taking hold and controlling the narrative for history like for for us history in the future right so if it's not in the official you know White House transcripts did it really happen sure there'll be video of it but who knows I just feel like it's to attempt to whitewash everything I hear you Anna and it's and it's a great point a lot of people have already called it Orwellian because it is the government says do not listen to your ears and do not believe your eyes so bow your head okay and and it's also the technical definition of politically correct both the Soviets and the Nazis would say yes that is technically correct but it is not politically correct so you should strike that from the record and they would not allow you to use certain language etc so in this case they go well it is obviously factually correct that Putin said that but it is not politically correct that he said that so remove it from the transcript but it's such a ham-handed is it ham-handed or fisted either way a ham-fisted way of doing that right because it's not 1948 it's not night you know it's not the old days where the government just wipes it off and no one knows maybe some guy wrote it in a newspaper wiki you could easily deny it it's the year 2018 we all see it we already saw it so to try to wipe the record clean you cannot do that as in this day and age but he's too stupid to realize that all it does is exposes you further but I have even better news so he in so he wipes that away because he's obviously guilty and he's trying to cover up his guilt but the more important part of this story is there is no summary of his one-on-one meeting with Putin he would not allow it oh the schmuck admitted things when he was with Putin I don't know how we're gonna find out I don't know if it's because of the translators I don't know if Muller can somehow get his hands on that information and you know Trump he's such an idiot and so are his lawyers that maybe they'll bungle it it right into the prosecutors hands as they did with the Michael Cohen tapes but he must have said things they're talking about his collusion and and so you could say oh no Jake you're doing especially sorry believe whatever the hell you want to believe here's what we know Trump's like no no don't let anybody find out even a summary of what I said to Putin so he must have said things that were I mean if you're a logical person so who are which show that he's guilty of course and he's so stupid I told you can't cover it up he'd probably go in there and go Vlad what do you need me to do next don't worry just me and you in this room so there there are some updates to this whole story if you could recall even though it was a terrible idea Donald Trump had invited Vladimir Putin to the White House they were supposed to meet in Washington DC and it has just been reported today that the White House has decided to postpone that meeting until after the midterm elections likely in 2019 and I think it's because finally someone in his circle convinced him that it is a terrible idea in the middle of this investigation after this hellish joint press conference in Helsinki it's a terrible idea to invite Vladimir Putin to the White House and and look it's not necessarily a terrible idea to invite Vladimir Putin for a discussion right in any other context I'd be fine with that in the context of Donald Trump I if you care about him and you don't want him to make more mistakes you do you want to dissuade him from inviting value look a couple of the guys here I involve it but hey Suz Edwin the guys who work on the crew through our director etcetera made a great point if Putin had come into the Oval Office he would have sat in the president's chair and they would have taken a picture and they would have put it out I know it's obviously speculation we'll probably never find out but he would have done it because that's who Putin is and he would have made sure that he knew where where he stood yeah and it would have been devastating to trump so this is a rare situation where Trump's advisors have headed off disaster but this Astra's coming either way now this again I grant you this a speculation okay and I'm being clear with you about it but I know guys like Putin certainly don't know putting himself but he has that smirk on his face throughout that entire press conference where he's pulling the strings on Trump and getting Trump to say I don't know why it would have been the Russians Oh probably not it was our our intelligence is stupid and weak right yes Russia is strong right so during that press conference he's got that smirk on his face and then they asked him the thing that we were just telling you about did you want Trump to and he's like of course I did now you don't admit that if you're trying to cover things up my guess is he will milk a Trump for everything that he could possibly get out of him see if he could destroy the NATO alliance etc etc and then when he's done with Trump he's gonna release the compromise anyway because that's who Putin is he's a bad guy and he revels in his power and he revels and destroy things and even if you say hey Jake you're trying to psychoanalyze Putin ok fair but remember that putin the other objective he had was chaos in america and if you want chaos at the end you'd release the p tape anyway ok so take take take take take take take take listen i think ben mankiewicz is right when he says a picture is not necessarily worth a thousand words but with that said to jinx point take a look at this throughout the entire well i'm it I love the bowing posture of Trump even more but this smirk does add a nice little touch to it like now what did I tell you reach yes sir America's at fault not Russia I'm so sorry for America sir oh my god that again I know we're over analyzing and it's just one snapshot in time let's be clear the picture means nothing I just think it's funny and entertaining I agree yeah but that unfortunately if we are right is the picture of their relationship two easy ways for Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT
