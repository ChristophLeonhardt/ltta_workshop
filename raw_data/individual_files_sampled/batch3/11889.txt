hello and welcome to the Peter Schmeichel show the group face are nearly done of this FIFA World Cup 2018 here in Russia two more days of play and we know who all the 16 teams that would play in the next stage of this tournament are and by the end of today four more teams would have qualified and other four teams would be on their way back home for today it all begins in Group F and that's where Mexico they play Sweden and Germany they're up against South Korea and both games kicks off at the same time 5:00 p.m. Moscow time so who will go through here well the short answer is that everybody can Mexico who have won the first two games can still end up going home after today in South Korea who has lost both of their two games they could still be in the tournament if they beat Germany with more than three goals and Sweden at the same time they loses to Mexico it can get very complicated if Germany and Sweden when their games one nil that would leave Mexico Germany and Sweden and six points each all having scored three goals and conceded two and in this case the rules are not that clear I've checked this with FIFA Germany and Sweden they will go through and Mexico will be out and that would be very very harsh since they were literally in the next round until twenty cause the German superstar scored in the 96 minute to make it 2-1 to Germany or was Sweden in the game on Saturday so incredible amount to look forward to in this group and as I said the two matches that are kicking off at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon and then at nine o'clock tonight it's a conclusion of group II the group of death and it certainly has lived up to that name here at Brazil plays Serbia and Costa Rica play Switzerland and let's just take a look at the group table Brazil are and four points they lead with the smallest of margins one goal to Switzerland Serbia in third place with three points and the only thing that we can be absolutely sure about here is that Costa Rica will be leaving for home after the game other than that it's completely open between the three remaining teams and all three can and will go through if they win but only Brazil in Switzerland are guaranteed to go through if they draw so they can only progress with a draw if Costa Rica beats the Swiss so a lot of potential twists and turns in wait and we will know for sure who's been successful at around eleven o'clock tonight in the euros two years ago Switzerland was a so-called hard to beat team a solid defensive block was a foundation and a one-nil win or well Vania and then three draws losing only in penalties to Poland in the last 16 match was proof of that but a qualification to this World Cup and in the two games they played here in Russia so far they've played with more style and flair I've spoken to the team captain Stephan leash Steiner about the change four years ago you you had a heart problem and you had surgery how is that affected you or your career and the decisions that you've made now of course in the first two three days I hear Eliza I was a little bit afraid but after I had very good doctors would explain me everything and of course if you have something like this Union after you enjoy it more because you never know when your career is finished so if all depression you have in a club like you enters I started to enjoy a little bit more also the life as a footballer you know what about as a person as a human being the design of course with two children but I think outside of a bitch still quiet guy so I I don't have to change something laughter you have a problem like this you stop to to be angry for small things why are Switzerland always doing well in the competitions because we reworked a lot of maybe changed a little bit our style to play before we scored many goals and corner kicks on free kicks and now we have still a team that is playing is playing also forward not anymore only behind and then you play on controls also now we play just good food you have with these different mentalities we have players I can do the one against one they have very good shots very good crosses so we worked a lot of this also to not be afraid to play against the big teams and stay only be high to attack them because it's not what they don't like that's why I'm sure that also in this World Cup we will do a very good tournament you have sort of a very multinational cultural group of players do you think that plays a part in that that you can change yeah I think I think because they bring a lot of quality at the beginning we had some problems because of the mentalities is so different but then we spoke a lot of envy so we are not so different like we was thinking so and on the pitch they they bring a lot of quality and they are just good guys what kind of difference have they brought to to the squad to the atmosphere in the squad they are not thinking like we do I guess he's going he's crossing three times behind the goal he starts to think oh no next time maybe I stop and I give back because and they are easier in the head you know so they go and teach as to just who they are not so like this Vista okay now I do I did do me two mistakes so maybe the next time looking for the for the safety pass now they're just easier they don't think about mistakes they're just playing for football and enjoy has it been the opposite have been problems as well it has been difficult to deal with maybe at the begin because the mentality was to begin a little bit different so they need to understand what we are Swiss we want on Swiss is not easy to to stay with us because you need to be on time and one just once they go on the yeah you get angry so for some people it was not easy to understand that we have a big standard in Switzerland also all the lives so you ask a lot of from the other guys also so typically in this was maybe a problem but and then they showed this ECC side of the life and we may be opened a little bit and now it's just a great moment to come in the national team so we just enjoying all the trainings and maybe this was also a little bit the point that we worked a lot they like they love to play football to enjoy the football but at the end you need to tell them a what it's important is winning what's the expectations what you think you can do of course we need to pass the group it's uh it's not easy because if Brazil you have a very big team in the group after you've Costa Rica they did very well four years ago and also Serbia they have just great layers and yeah that's why you need to you need to be ready it will be a big fight but at the end I'm confident and we'll pass this group what about the people of Switzerland what what do you think there are expectations are to what that team can do just waiting just a lot of our team you know because you are also used now that the team is going to the World Cup European champion you passed the group four years ago with fast we played against Argentina in the European Championship euro v past we went house against Poland so they're just waiting a lot of us and but if you play well the people will get you when the team start to do good to play good and the peoples are coming more and more but you don't have this dispatch from begin from from your friends how much you working on defending because you always so good at it yeah I think it's a little bit the history of former County you know if you are a small country so you are just in front of the goal and the song behind you it's not so big to defend its that what we changed a lot off also against the small teams that you start to make the game so we are more in the office if zone you need to be better on the placement in the parent if defending you know so when you are only behind with eleven players it's easier because the zone is small to space to defend is small but what we worked a lot of is when we attack then everybody is already with the strike that when the ball is coming out that we are there maybe you can do foul maybe you can take the body for him so we don't need to do 18 metres behind and 80 meters again forward so you you don't lose so much energy that was he was working a lot and yes after of course it's a little bit because we born to defend you know we are not Brazil like that you go ok we go when we score now we are born to defend that's why it's a little bit in our blood too No would you say that the group that you ended up in is probably the hardest group in the world come I don't know because I was not looking too much to other groups I'm just focus on our group it's it's not easy like we spoke already before Pattaya but I'm I'm positive I'm sure that we will pass this this group because we have to quality because we wanna we want to do it and if you really want to do it you will do it so I'm positive do you have your own way of playing and it's it's unconditional or do you change your way of playing from games again no we have now our own game before it was much more focused on the other team because we never had this quality that we have now so now we have this quality to play football to play a really good football to start the action from behind to make a good pressing also to be radios on the preventive different work so I think now we t begin of course like you spoke before you see a little bit the team and maybe of course against proceed we will not go up up up up because you know if you keep them spaced they will leave a key you know if you won against one every time against Neymar against Douglas cost all this very good player it will be difficult to make a good result but also them they don't like to defend so just just to leave your game and be careful on the important or on the detentions points that our team have and at that point I think like we spoke before you will make the analyzes you know directly then as the new modern foot police you look at our team and then just do a little bit tactic on them and then of course you work on these points yes but in order to win a game of football you have to score goals yeah so who's gonna score your goals who is your top scorer I hope me know yeah we have we have a lot of good strikers it's true that maybe it was our biggest problem during the qualification because we have strikers they are working very well they are they let play the team very good because it's important to have players they are moving they're holding the balls that you can come up but we haven't placed that I score this code more than four goals in the you know qualification and this is a point that we need to work very hard over this one against run in the training to to try to go to of course the goalkeepers they are working also a lot of that know because you know exactly Kodi striker is coming and but you need to take the confidence that you scroll from 1001 against Ronnie do you need to score minimum seven goals and that we need to work a little bit but I'm confident that at the end we we will find some player who scores you know so when you look up up to the page the players in front of you who are you looking at to change the cause of a game who is the star player or players in your team at the end of course all the team is very important we have some key players I think in the offensive parties Shaqiri that it's really important for us he has something that nobody has he can do just in one moment he can do the different if his his left foot very good one against one and on the right side with me it's just working very good because he's coming you can overlap him and indeed he was right about Shakira he has put in some really big performances already the highlight of course was scoring that last minute winner I can serve your Friday night to give Switzerland that incredible 2-1 victory tonight Switzerland play Costa Rica and enjoy in that game will be enough for them to still be part of the FIFA World Cup for Costa Rica though the World Cup is already over and that has been a major disappointment for the country remember four years ago they went all the way to the quarterfinals so the expectations of what this team could do here in Russia were very high I went to Costa Rica earlier this year to find out why it is that a small Central American country keeps getting to the World Cups and after with great success and who better to ask than my old friend and teammate palawan chopper welcome to Costa Rica honey yeah oh it's better than mine Chester Denmark oh you don't need an umbrella I think I've played here in this stadium and what was the score listen to be talking about Korea he came over here to learn how to play so that's great he came to Costa Rica and I think it was great career so it's very nice to be in Costa Rica and and the reason that I'm in Costa Rica is it's very similar to Denmark in terms of population and and small country with a lot of success in the World Cup and I kind of want to find out what what you guys are doing that puts you in that position so I'm a young kid I'm 8 years 10 years of age and I want to play football so what what's happening the main thing is to play understand on the street I mean I grew up playing on the street and every Park everywhere happens even today I mean actually the good players over here we come from from from the street you know playing on the street and then after when they got when they get into 13 14 years old they will get into clubs like you know the the biggest clubs over here in in Costa Rica the Academy Scouts do they go and scout the kids in the street and everywhere and everywhere yeah everywhere how did you get found I played on the street as well and then I was in a small academy and then from where I was there for since I was six to 12 year old yeah but mainly only Saturdays we only practice only Saturdays and and everyday is just playing on the street when you when you are playing against I don't know in a small place 10 B 10 or 15 B 15 you will you will manage how to you know be creative every neighbourhood you will find a pitch you will find a pitch and you will find a church and you will find all the kids in the pitch and the parents in the church yes well everyone has to go first in the church and then and then to play that's the way we grew up would you say that football is the most important thing in Costa Rica it is it is the first sport for for Costa Rica's is football blue Belize is crazy and now these days is even even more it's like history repeats itself Costa Rica qualified again for the 2018 World Cup in Russia again from either in the group of death for me the most difficult group of the line is up against Serbia Switzerland and the mighty Brazil again again yeah if the third time you know in what is four World Cups so you kind of find yourself in a similar position looking into the World Cup but what is the the atmosphere and the expectations this time around in the country well the spectator is high you know because we've done a good job in 2014 and people people don't realize you know how hard is this group you know people think that because we play against Switzerland and against Serbia it will be easy games but I've been trying to say I've been trying you know every interview just saying to them that be careful and it is it's really tough group great players players playing in in the biggest teams in in Europe I know it's difficult I've been trying to say to everyone that it will be tough but you know what it's called challenges and I think every country going into the World Cup will feel they have those kind of challenges Paulo I wish you and Costa Rica all the best in their encounter so for Costa Rica it is goodbye for now and so it could be for Brazil as well that would be a massive upset if that was to happen but it could be a reality come 11 o'clock tonight they play Serbia it's a stupid and difficult team and with only four brazilian players that's Pitino Casimir habilis and Marcelo in my opinion performing to their normal high standard it is going to be a very very hard match for them if that doesn't change a Neymar is very much at the center of this for me he's been poor in fact I believe that he's Brazil's biggest problem he's using these World Cups to convince all of us fans that he is the best player in the world and it's not working for him and he knows this at times it has spoiled into frustration and even desperation and instead of playing for his team he's playing for name are doing trickery choosing the impossible solution that looks really good when it comes off but very very bad when it doesn't and then that's all the diving it irritates the hell out of me have you ever seen Messi dive around like that or Ronaldo in the last many years hurricane or any other true world-class players in this tournament do all that well I haven't and I think it's part of being world-class that you do things correctly someone like Messi always attracts special attention from opponents but he deals with it and he hardly ever acts out name I on the other hand he uses so much energy to try and get free kicks another player's booked and it takes so much of his own performances beyond copious the Dutch referee from the game against Costa Rica initially fell for all this and gave name a penalty only to take it away from him again after consulting var that was great refereeing and great use of our but the whole world was watching and he was a truly embarrassing moment for Nima and you can only hope that Nima he will learn from that situation let's stay with Val for a second for since last week's show we've seen quite a few incidents being judged by var some was really good like the penalty against name out I just spoke about but also some really bad ones and it's important to remember that even though it is technology it still being looked at and is still being interpreted by people and people often see things differently but when the Swedish striker Marcus Berg was clean through one-on-one with Manuel Neuer the German goalkeeper in the game between Germany and Sweden and most clearly fouled at the moment he was about to pull the trigger the referee wave play on and the assistant var did not react just as a reminder this is what FIFA president Giano Infantino told us last week on the Peter Schmeichel show in 2018 if everyone in front of his TV or inside the stadium with his mobile phone knows within a few seconds whether the referee has committed a big mistake and the only one who doesn't know it is the referee himself we make something wrong I think that we can all agree on the whole world its seed and yet nothing was giving I think the referee made a mistake by not giving the penalty straight away but I fully accept that that's part of the game it happens but the VAR assistance obligation is to alert the referee that he might be making and this is FIFA language by the way a clear and obvious mistake and I think he told him that it was not a penalty and therefore grossly led the referee down so why didn't the Polish referee call var himself well why would he if he was told that it was not a foul and this I believe goes against the principle of the whole system var is a tool for the referee to help him or her make the correct decision and var is introduced to make football more fair and once we get a few years down the line with this technology it will just be part of the game and we won't be talking so much about it but until then expect more controversy and more debate see you next week on the Peter Schmeichel show
