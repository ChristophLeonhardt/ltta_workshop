00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,075
Dear Senator Marco Rubio,
my name is Shana Rosenthal,

2
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:05,070
and I used to be your intern.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,440
I listened to constituent
calls day in and day out,

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,740
and logged their concerns,
which were sent to you.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,400
And now three years later, I’m
one of those concerned citizens

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,120
pleading for change from you,
our elected Florida official.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,700
In my short lifetime
of 21 years,

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,120
I’ve been within the vicinity
of four mass shootings

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,580
where 152 people have
been murdered or injured.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,570
I was a mile up the street from
Pulse Nightclub.

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,540
Eight months before that, Florida State
University.

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,470
Five people at my local airport, inching
closer and closer to Marjory

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,720
Stoneman Douglas my alma mater.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,340
I've realized no one is safe.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,945
I don’t want this
to happen any more.

16
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:49,320
I think we need to wait to
make sure number one that most

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,250
of the laws — and I don’t
want to get into that debate

18
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:51,720
right now.

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,930
There’s people
watching this that

20
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,460
may have someone they
love, then that’s not

21
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,085
what they’re interested
at this moment.

22
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:56,790
Maybe they are.

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,580
It is your job as
our elected official

24
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,560
to protect your constituents.

25
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,240
This isn’t about party politics.

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,540
This is about human lives,
lives of my friends,

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,790
my family, my community members.

28
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,650
I’m begging you to implement
a systematic plan which

29
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,020
will end mass shootings.

30
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,100
Obviously, there’s a debate in
this country about what our gun

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,600
laws should be, and
I’ve always said

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,610
if there’s a gun law that
could have prevented this

33
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,906
or any other instance, it’s
something we should definitely

34
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:23,700
consider doing.

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,710
You can begin by
funding research

36
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,690
on gun violence and
gun violence prevention

37
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,600
so we can at least
begin to understand

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,970
the underlying crisis at hand.

39
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,640
Implementing stricter
gun licensing,

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,670
extensive background
checks, closing loopholes

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,330
in gun purchasing at
gun shows, implementing

42
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,600
a buffer period
between gun purchasing

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,030
and bringing the weapon home.

44
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,650
I hope you hear this
message free of influence

45
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,020
from wealthy lobbying
powers which impede

46
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,730
your senatorial judgment.

47
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,720
Senator Marco Rubio, I
want you to prove me wrong.

48
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,290
I want you to prove that you’re
not just another wasted seat

49
00:02:02,290 --> 00:00:00,000
and that you truly care
about your constituents.
