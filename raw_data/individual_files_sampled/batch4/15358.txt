so there was Premier Kathleen Wynne speaking to a group of diverse students at Humber College the other day urging them to go out and exercise their right to vote in the upcoming June election now urging the importance of young people to exercise their voting franchise is a jolly good idea indeed but check out how Wynne framed her plea verbatim the reality is that young people vote at a much much lower rate than older people and I always say when I knock on a door and I meet a young person who comes and says you know I'm not gonna vote it doesn't make a difference you know if you don't vote then somebody looks like me is going to vote some senior person older than me some white person you know the reality is that that's the demographic that's going to get out and vote so we need you we need you to be engaged can you even believe your ears look if Wynne said older people tend to get out and vote more than the younger generations . period well there's no story and this would be factually correct indeed a Statistics Canada report found that age matters a great deal when it comes to voting participation in 2011 the voting turnout rate was about 50% among people aged 18 to 24 and was only a few percentage points higher among 25 to 34 year olds for those people aged 35 to 44 the participation rate was just below the national average now by way of contrast older people were more likely to vote would turnout rates increasing to 70 percent among 45 to 54 year olds and the highest turnout rate 82% were among those aged 65 to 74 and because the wind' Liberals have a majority government surely a large chunk of those older people voted liberal even so when just couldn't resist some virtuous signaling by playing the race card or is it the white privilege card or is it the white supremacy card it's so hard to tell these days still one thing certain wins a statement was purely racist just imagine how her remark would play if she had substituted white for any other identifiable group but somehow it seems okay to slam white people and I say that it seems okay given that wins a vile statement received precious little press coverage when I think it should have been front page news all of which makes me ponder if we're at a juncture now in which slamming Caucasians is so commonplace that it's simply part of the fabric of society that this idea of dumping on white people is now so common that it's something to be expected not exposed indeed there seems to be so much to blame whites for like the election of Donald Trump after all last week Hillary Clinton said that one of the big reasons she lost the US election was that the lack of white woman voting for her given that these hongki's surely acquiesced to the demands of their husbands and bosses to vote Republican you just can't make this kind of crap up folks meanwhile back in Ontario there surely some perverse irony when it comes to wind fretting about old white people and it's this well the other two leaders of the mainstream opposition parties are also white namely Doug Ford and Andrea Horwath win is by far the oldest leader indeed the MU the more one analyzes her statement the more ludicrous it seems because what wind said was essentially this vote for an old white liberal like me because otherwise you'll end up with an old white progressive conservative like Ford or an old white and appear like Horwath that's just bizarre in any event given wins odious lack of color and her egregious elderly status I humbly suggest that the premier should lead by example which is to say she needs to resign immediately then the Ontario Liberals should promote Mitzi hunter the minister of affirmative action as the uncontested leader of their party after all if this alyc upcoming election is all to be about skin pigmentation rather than merit then Mitzi oughta win in a landslide that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
