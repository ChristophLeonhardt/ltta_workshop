HOMELESS, INVOLVED WITH DRUGS

190
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:22,732
AND THEY PICK UP ON THIS BECAUSE

191
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:23,899
THEY SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACT

192
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,134
OUT, IN MY OPINION.

193
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:26,936
I DON'T SEE IT AS PART OF THE

194
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:28,971
MOB, BUT I MUST SAY THE RIGHT

195
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:31,707
HAS PLUGGED INTO THAT WORD AS A

196
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,775
VEHICLE FOR SAYING TO THEIR

197
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:35,111
VOTERS, HEY, WE ARE FACING BAD

198
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:36,545
GUYS, A MOB OUT THERE, AND I

199
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:37,913
THINK THAT'S WHAT BROOKE BALDWIN

200
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:38,347
WAS DOING.

201
00:05:38,348 --> 00:05:40,316
SHE WAS SAYING DON'T JUST USE

202
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:41,317
THE WORD HELTER-SKELTER BECAUSE

203
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:43,519
IT FITS THE REPUBLICAN TALKING

204
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,420
POINTS FOR THE MIDTERM

205
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:44,787
ELECTIONS.

206
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:48,924
IF YOU SEE A MOB, COLLECT A MOB.

207
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:51,127
HE WAS TYING ABOUT PEOPLE

208
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:52,728
HARASSING SOMEONE IN A

209
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:53,129
RESTAURANT.

210
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:53,796
>> Kennedy: YOU HAVE SOME

211
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:55,564
DEMOCRATS CALLING FOR MOBS.

212
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:57,566
THAT'S THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE.

213
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,436
PEOPLE AT CORY BOOKER AND MAXINE

214
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:01,604
WATERS AND THE PROFESSOR AT

215
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:03,639
OLE MISS, WHICH IS A GREAT

216
00:06:03,640 --> 00:00:00,000
SCHOOL.
