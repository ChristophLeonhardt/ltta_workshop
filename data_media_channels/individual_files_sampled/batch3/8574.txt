MAKING US NUMBER ONE LAST WEEKEND. FIRST NOW MY OPENING STATEMENT. IT'S COME TO THIS? NO MORE CIVIL DISCOURSE? WHAT HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY IS BEYOND ANYTHING WE HAVE EVER SEEN IN AMERICAN POLITICS. POLITICAL DEBATE AT THE VERY HEART OF THE FOUNDING OF THIS COUNTRY HAS DEINVOLVED INTO POLITICAL HARASSMENT AND OUTRIGHT POLITICAL ABUSE. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY, ONE OF THE MOST OF PRESTIGIOUS JOBS IN WASHINGTON, D.C., OUT TO DINNER, PLACES HER ORDER AND IS THEN TOLD TO LEAVE BY THE OWNER BECAUSE SHE WORKS FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SARAH QUIETLY LEAVES. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY KIRSTJEN NIELSEN THIS WEEK WAS LITERALLY SCREAMED AND HECKLED OUT OF A RESTAURANT WHILE EATING HER DINNER. TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE BEING HARASSED ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY BY A HYSTERICAL LEFT UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THE DECISION AND THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO PUT DONALD TRUMP IN OFFICE. THESE UNHINGED LEFTISTS ARE NORMALIZING OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR WHICH IS ONLY GETTING WORSE. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? ONCE THE DEMOCRATS 24-7 COLLUSION NONSENSE FIZZLED, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OTHER THAN CORRUPTION ON THE PART OF THE TOP LEVEL OF THE FBI AND DOJ TO FRAME DONALD TRUMP, THE LEFT NEEDED A NEW ISSUE, A NEW DEFLECTION TO SOME OTHER MADE-UP WRONGDOING ON THE PART OF DONALD TRUMP. WHAT COULD WE ACCUSE HIM OF? WHAT CAN WE BLAME HIM FOR NOW? THEY THEN DEFLECT TO THE INHUMANE SEPARATION OF CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES AT THE BORDER. NOW, I WANT TO BE CLEAR. I HAVE SPENT MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE FIGHTING FOR CHILDREN, CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED AND INJURED AND HARMED. THERE IS NOTHING MORE HEARTBREAKING THAN CHILDREN BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS. THE FAMILY COURT SEPARATES PARENTS FROM THEIR CHILDREN EVERY DAY, AND CRIMINAL JUDGES SEPARATE PARENTS FROM THEIR CHILDREN AND EVERY DAY CHILDREN ARE PLACED IN FOSTER CARE. AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYONE ON THE LEFT COMPLAIN. FOR THOSE OF YOU SO BLIND BY TRUMP HATRED. THERE ARE LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY. A PRIMER. WHEN YOU CROSS THE BORDER INTO THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY, EXPECT TO BE ARRESTED. YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO COME HERE. WE DID NOT INVITE YOU HERE. AND YOU CANNOT STAY HERE. BUT ON YOUR WAY OUT, YOU CAN THANK BILL CLINTON AND HIS FLORES SETTLEMENT THAT REQUIRES CHILDREN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS WITHIN 20 DAYS OF CROSSING THE BORDER. AND YOU CAN ALSO THANK PRESIDENT BUSH AND OBAMA FOR SIGNING INTO LAW THAT CHILDREN CANNOT BE DETAINED AT THE BORDER LONGER THAN 20 DAYS UNDER THE TRAFFICKING PROTECTION ACT. NOW EVERYONE WANTS TO GO AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CREATED. GEORGE BUSH DID NOTHING ABOUT IT. BARACK OBAMA DID NOTHING BY THE. AND LAURA BUSH WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU FOR A WHILE. THANKS FOR ENTERING THE FRAY AND CALLING THE REMOVAL OF CHILDREN TRUE AND INHUMANE. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST ROLL OVER ONE NIGHT AND TELL YOUR HUSBAND THE PRESIDENT THAT HIS ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY WAS CRUEL AND INHUMANE? THE LEFT JUST DOESN'T CARE WHAT THE FACTS ARE. POLITICIANS ARE WILLING TO STAND UP AND TOTALLY CONTRADICT THEMSELVES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO CREATE POLITICAL CHAOS, HATRED AND ABUSE. STENY HOYER, THE MOST OF SENIOR-HANGING DEMOCRAT IN CONGRESS SENIOR-RANKING LAWYER SAYS THIS. HE'S TAKING INFANT CHILDREN HOSTAGE. WRENCHING THEM FROM THE ARMS OF THEIR PARENTS. TRAUMATIZING THEM PERHAPS FOR LIFE. JUDGE JEANINE: STENY, YOU HAVE BEEN IN CONGRESS FOR 37 YEARS. YOU SAID NOTHING DURING THE CLINTON, BUSH OR OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, AND NOW YOU ARE WORRIED? SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS SAYS THIS. WE I AM PRISONED THEM. WE PUT THEM BEHIND BARBED WIRES. JUDGE JEANINE: KAMALA, WHEN YOU WERE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN CALIFORNIA, OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN. THE SEPARATING OF CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES ONLY HURTS IF DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT? PETER FONDA SAYS WE SHOULD RIP THE PRESIDENT'S SON FROM HIS MOTHER'S ARMS AND PUT HIM IN A CAGE WITH PEDOPHILES. PETER WHY DON'T YOU GET ON YOUR MOTORCYCLE AND TAKE A RIDE OFF THE PLANET. J-LO SAYS THIS CHILD IS SEPARATED FROM HER PARENTS IN MOSUL BY ISIS. EVEN "TIME" MAGAZINE IS SO BLIND THAT THEY IGNORE ALL JOURNALISTIC STANDARD TO TRASH DONALD TRUMP. THE CHILD DEPICTED HERE ANOTHER COVER WAS NOT SEPARATED FROM HER MOTHER. IN FACT THE CHILD HERE WAS TAKEN BY THE MOTHER WITHOUT THE FATHER'S PERMISSION OR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT FROM HER HOME COUNTRY. AND THIS MOTHER BY THE WAY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEPORTED. WE CANNOT ALLOW OUR COUNTRY TO BE OVERRUN BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. THE ON RESOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO BUILD THE WALL. AMNESTY DOES NOTHING BUT CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR ADDITIONAL CROSSING BILE ILLEGALS. MAKE NO MISTAKE. THE DEMOCRATS ARE SIMPLY LOOKING FOR AN ISSUE FOR THE 2018 MID-TERMS. EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO LIE, CREATE FALSE IMAGES AND A MOVEMENT TO INTIMIDATE TRUMP SUPPORTERS THEY WILL STOP AT NOTHING. WE ARE IN A DANGEROUS PLACE RIGHT NOW. HATE IS HATE. HATE LEAD TO HARASSMENT AND ABUSE. AND THAT ABUSE LEADS TO VIOLENCE. AND THAT VIOLENCE LEADS TO RETALIATION. ANY THREAT OF VIOLENCE THAT CON INJURES UP A VISUAL OF VIOLENCE IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN JUST HAVING DIFFERENT POLITICAL VIEWS. WE ARE A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FROM THOSE WILLING TO CROSS THE LINE OF POLITICAL DEBATE TO THOSE WILLING TO CROSS THE LINE
