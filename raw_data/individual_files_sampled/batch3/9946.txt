TONIGHT CORRESPONDENT TALKS ABOUT THE BAD TIMING FOR THOSE OF YOU DRIVING DURING SUMMER VACATION. IT IS HARD NOT TO NOTICE, EVEN WHEN YOU CANNOT BEAR TO LOOK. I'M SCARED TO DEATH, BECAUSE I GET PENNED ON THAT EXTRA MONEY FOR MY CAR AND GROCERIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. GIESE PRESSES ON THE RISE, THE CRUNCH FOR COMMUTERS THAT STRETCHES THE FAMILY BUDGET. WHEN I STARTED GAS WAS $2.20 PER GALLON, NOW IT IS UP TO $3 PER GALLON DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU SHOP, THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE. THE USUAL TALK OF THE SUMMER DRIVING SEASON BEING THE REASON FOR THE RISE IS OUT THERE, BUT EXPERTS SAY THERE IS MORE AT WORK HERE THAN JUST THE CALENDAR. CONCERNS ABOUT THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL FALLOUT FOR ONE. WHICH SOME SPECULATE COULD TREND GLOBAL SUPPLIES. CONSIDER OILS PLUNGED FROM $100 A BARREL TO JUST BELOW $30 A BARREL IN 2016. AND ACCORDINGLY PRICES FELL, BUT SINCE THEN THEY HAVE BEEN ON THE RISE WITH WEST TEXAS CRUDE, THE U.S. BENCHMARK TOPPING $71 A BARREL. AS IT IS UP 14% FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. AND MORE PAYING AT THE PUMP WITH THEIR NATIONAL PRICE PER GALLON AVERAGING $2.84, UP $0.19 OVER LAST MONTH AND $0.51 HIGHER THAN THIS TIME LAST YEAR. EXPERTS SAY THAT IS IN PART BECAUSE WALL STREET TRADERS ANTICIPATED THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO PULL OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL. THE MARKET WAS PREPARED FOR THE U.S. TO PULL OUT, A CAMPAIGN PROMISE THAT HE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO DO WHATEVER HE CAN IN HIS POWER WHETHER GOOD OR BAD FOR THE PRESENT SITUATION TO KEEP THE CAMPAIGN PROMISES. THE PRESIDENT HAS ALSO PROMISED TO RETALIATE AGAINST THOSE WHO MANIPULATE THE PRICE OF OIL. TWEETING THAT IT LOOKS LIKE OPEC IS ADDED AGAIN. OIL PRICES ARE ARTIFICIALLY VERY HIGH. NO GOOD. AND WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. EXPERTS ARGUE THAT FRANKLY NOT MUCH OF THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN DO ABOUT THE PROBLEM SHORT OF TAPPING THE NATION'S STRATEGIC RESERVES. THAT IS A MOVE THAT THEY SAY
