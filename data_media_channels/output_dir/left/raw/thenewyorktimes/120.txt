1
00:00:02,915 --> 00:00:06,110
There’s nothing like
the physics of fruit.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,990
Specifically, citrus fruit.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,510
What you’re seeing is
the skin of a fruit being

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,090
squeezed by pliers
to produce dozens

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,910
of ultra-fast microjets.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,890
The tiny streams
rocketing out of the skin

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,430
have been slowed
down 266 times.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,150
In real time, these jets
travel 30 feet per second —

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,370
about the speed of
a Champagne cork.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,610
Other plants also
produce microjets.

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,090
This squirting cucumber
does it to spread its seeds.

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,040
In the animal kingdom
a similar process

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,620
is used for swift
attacks, like that

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,560
of the ferocious
spitting cobra.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,620
Scientists who study the
mechanism of citrus jets

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,590
found that sacs of oil
lie on the soft layer

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,900
beneath a more rigid skin.

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,090
As the fruit is
squeezed, the skin

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,100
hits a sudden failure point.

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,770
The skin breaks, and the
fluid erupts under pressure.

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,130
Here’s a ruptured
sac afterward.

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,140
Scientists don’t know
why citrus fruits have

23
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,370
this ability, but they’re
keen to harness its power.

24
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,160
It could help with commercial
printing, medicine delivery,

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,050
and even bridge safety.

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,630
Imagine a sensor that
changes color or gives off

27
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,830
a signal when a bridge
has hit its maximum load.

28
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,960
But for now, it’s a
reminder that some

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,750
of the most mundane
aspects of daily life

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:00:00,000
can hold beautiful secrets.
