Bellus we're gonna do something and they do have great power I agree with it they have great power over you people they have less power over me I don't need I don't what do I need but they but I tell you they are well-meaning welcome back good morning JAL let's bring in right now Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar she was actually in that meeting yesterday and Senator I guess a question that a lot of people want to know is are we going to be looking back at that meeting like we look back at the meeting that was supposed to take care of daca or do you think we actually may see some real movement from this president well I hope it's not the same thing my colleagues that were in the meeting about dreamers left there and we regulan thought something was going to get done and we were obviously undermine literally the last day after a group of Democrats Republicans I was one of them had come together with a common sense idea about how to make sure that those kids can stay in the country and then we had some border security fast forward here we are from yesterday there is a difference and I'd say one difference is it was a very clear focus on this universal background check and he didn't just say at once or twice he said it like 10 times and the American people are very focused on this right now he's heard it from the kids you've got kids marching in my mind we've reached a tipping point and for him to say that to the American people and then turned back on that I think that would be something like we've never seen in terms of a betrayal and so it's on him now not only to keep up that focus but also to get the members of his own party to get behind it because that was the major problem last time when we tried to pass this well it's interesting you know you look for smoke signals coming out of the White House to see the president backing down but he tweeted this morning and he talked about the need for moving forward on background checks said something had to be done how how did the other Republicans in the room react after the cameras were turned off do you believe that you can get support from the majority of Republicans and the majority of the Senate on a strong background checks not yet didn't have some kind of a conversion during that meeting but Center to me of course I know was on the show earlier he is he's made the case and there are some Republicans that have voted for it they're going to add to their numbers but it's so simple it simply closes the loophole for gun hole gun for gun sales and it also closes the loophole that you see when you have online sales so it is the you know our minds yeah chosen on line and wit and Willie you look at the story out of out of Dalton Georgia town I know very well when the Atlanta journal-constitution reporting this morning that the coach the teacher at Dalton high school yep actually he had tried to confess to a murder before and had several other incidents that should have tipped off authorities and also should have been part of possibly part of the background check that would have stopped him from being able to purchase weapons yeah and one of the things that really I thought was good that was talked about was these extreme risk orders protective orders like they have actually in Indiana the vice president talked about it at the meeting I know know that Senator Graham and Blumenthal are working on something is to create incentives for those so you could actually get that kind of information if families reported to law enforcement you could get that into a background check and so there are when the president said I he didn't just say I want universal background checks he said I want a bill that includes a number of things that's one of them my domestic violence suggestions when you have six thousand women that have died at the hands of intimate partners in ten years that's more than the brave troops that we lost in Iraq and Afghanistan combined he literally said that he wanted to include that in there as well so we're just gonna have to hold him at his word senator it's willie Geist in New York it was interesting to hear just a minute ago congressman Adam Kinzinger a Republican a veteran of the United States Air Force who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and owner of an ar-15 saying he believes the age should be raised to 21 to own an ar-15 that he Republican and a supporter of the Second Amendment rights is already considering based on what he's seen over the last two weeks or so changes to his positions on things through the years are you feeling that movement as well on Capitol Hill among Republicans who are pro Second Amendment but are willing now perhaps to make concessions they wouldn't have made in the past well if they listened to their gun owners a majority of gun owners want to see those background checks I want to do something I talked to a guy up in northern Minnesota where we have a proud proud hunting tradition up there and he said you know I'm a big supporter of the Second Amendment but I don't have a problem with bump stocks I don't have an issue with looking at some of these background checks so I think you're seeing a change and that's what the congressman was talking about but you know Joe specific question at the beginning with did those senators come out of the meeting and say yeah I want to work with you on the background check bill no we didn't hear that right away and what we don't want to have happen is to lose this momentum but I have this feeling when it's these kids who are already planning this major March at the end of March that we're not going to be losing momentum we're going to gain momentum senator noah rothman with commentary magazine so we're at the beginning of a big negotiation on what we're going to pursue legislatively regarding new gun restrictions the Supreme Court weighed in on Monday said this March 5th deadline for daca is basically off the table for existing daca recipients is daca done for this Congress are we pushing it off to 2019 I hope not we would love to go back to the table again but that was such a difficult defeat because you know we had the path to citizenship we had worked out border security money significant border security money but basically on that one the White House couldn't take yes for an answer and kept pushing and pushing and adding things and changing basically the the goalposts for us there and the goal-line so there we are and we are now you know we are happy to go back and talk about it but they're gonna have to talk with us because we lost Republican votes when that memo came out from Homeland Security does that are there bad omens there then for for gun control if that's the record that they had with negotiating with this white house in Dhaka that is exactly what we have as our immediate past moment but there's something different about this and it doesn't mean by the way hopefully we will do all we can and I believe that we will not let these dreamers be deported the court case hopes we can try to put some things in now but we at least have to hold the status quo so they can't be deported and they can continue working but what I saw yesterday was the president emphatically talking about specific proposals taking on his own party in front of the nation telling them that they were afraid of the NRA telling them that they had basically not done anything about this and that telling Steve Scalise who he said he loved but telling him no I don't think that that concealed-carry proposal is going to belong in this package I mean it was very specific remains to be seen if he'll stick to everything he said in that room we will see senator Amy Klobuchar Democrat of Minnesota thanks is
