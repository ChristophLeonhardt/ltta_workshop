now joining me in the studio we've got another California candidate in the 34th district Kenneth Mejia I'm sure I said that wrong so I am the worst with name's Kenneth how do you say the last thing Kenneth Mejia Mejia why is that so hard huger and he can't get that right all right anyway Kenneth you are in the green party I see that well because of the button you've got on and because of the green shirt you have on and it says it in my notes so you're taking on an incumbent Democrat yep okay so let's start with the fundamentals before we get to the insane amount of things you've accomplished in 26 years so why the Green Party not the Democratic Party well I actually started off in the Democratic Party I was Democrat but even before I was a green um you know like many people we think in LA that the Democrats are the people our party of the people were forced to learn that Republicans are bad guys and for someone like Bernie Sanders inspired me personally to actually run for Congress for the first time the first time I ran so that's why I picked the Democratic Party then after what happened to Bernie and the DNC the whole thing I decided well I think there should be another party that represents my values that has the same platform or even better and I found the Green Party so so in the rest of the country they'll tell you well you're gonna split the vote and you have the Republican win and why is that not the case in California California is a heavy blue state and Los Angeles specifically in our district in the 34th and in our election it's only us the incumbent Democrat and a libertarian so this if there's anywhere that can go green it's this district and this is the only district in LA that one for Bernie during the primaries okay and so and it's a what's called a jungle primary in California so the top two vote-getters no matter what their party goes on to the general election so there's usually and certainly in this case less of a chance of quote-unquote splitting the vote and and it's in the primary you'll get to find out if you advance so so no reason not to vote your conscience as it were but okay so it is a very liberal district so Jimmy Gomez the incoming any issues there or is he solidly progressive but you're just even more the left of them yeah I mean for the most part I think one of our big differences number one we don't receive big money he's received money from Goldman Sachs from navien the largest student that collect their health insurance company is in Big Pharma all within the last couple of months number two we could push harder on the issues than he's fight then he's pushing on for example he's not co-sponsoring things like the fair vote act or the college for all act which would make tuition free college and even though he's co-sponsored something like HR 676 single-payer he only talks about it when he campaigns and so that's sort of the things that we could do better is we could actually push on these issues that the Democratic Party has not put a full front on and I think that's sort of where we come in and we're not tied to any donors we could actually attend go out there both parties if we need to to get that the point done Kenneth I'm gonna play the role of Anderson Cooper yeah are you telling me that because he takes money from Goldman Sachs that he would be biased in favor of Goldman Sachs I mean who knows if he sees the progressive candidate and he's in Los Angeles a huge liberal progressive district then why even take the money so those are some of the questions that we need to know like if you're progressive you wouldn't even take it so that's a good question why even take the money you're the incumbent the Democratic Party supports you anyway and it's not like you're need the money because the Republicans are gonna put a big fight you're saying there's not even a Republican in the race he's not even a Republican in the race just me and him and a libertarian so so yeah but it's because the corruption is systemic it doesn't mean that Goma is a bad guy it doesn't mean all those candidates who take the corporate PAC money are bad people but it makes it so that we can't trust them right and so that's the issue there so you're in the Green Party so it would be awesome if you were taking corporate back money and you're like well I mean Lockheed Martin is really that bad so I assume you're not taking corporate PAC money nope we raise $30,000 in the last six months and our average donation is around $38 okay but we're gonna change that right now right lutely can I see that the links for Kenneth here so my Mejia Mejia for congress.com okay anyway donate and volunteer because again to see if you're interested in helping them out so let's talk about your preposterous work history I mean you are a neighborhood council board member a certified public accountant you organized an la tenants Union you were an air force officer training corps how did you fit this Jam this into 26 years yeah so well actually I graduated college in two and a half years at twenty and I was doing the Air Force ROTC and once I got a job at Ernst & Young as an auditor and I quit and I became a CPA and then from there actually I did that we had two and a half years of college because I always did like 26 units a semester and every in every season summer and then after that got a good job and then in a financial service industry making six figures at 25 and then saw someone like Bernie and I was like I'm quitting and so I quit and I ran as a write-in as a Democrat and it was like what are you doing you just you just gave it up you know coming from immigrant parents who work hard and like you just quit a six-figure job and so that's how I was able to you know I just have the bash oh yeah well Kenneth I've been there brother drug so and I like you got to go and I realize you work for Ernst and Young I used to yeah because when you were telling that story I was thinking this dude is Ernest right so we were actually now Ernest in young that's I'm here all week okay so you ran last time so you ran at the age of 24 25 25 25 okay so if you win will you be 26 or 27 if we went be 27 you'll be 20 so you imagine if we had a 27 year old congressman in California from the Green Party and the answer is yes I can't imagine it and Democratic socialists are winning all across the country it's a little different but not that different and so it's certainly possible so let's talk about the things that you've fought for in LA to give people a sense of what drives you so let's talk about the LA tenants Union how did that possess you to become a community organizer get him on that yeah so the LA tenant Jean has actually been around for the past two years they're doing great work all over LA there's about six to seven locals throughout LA County where basically tenants are fighting for the right to live in their you know their apartments and many of them are getting evicted due to large rent increases LA's known for that they're they they're getting their their their property bought out and next thing you know the landlord is selling it and now all these people are getting evicted and so we I got involved in it because its housing is the issue over time in Los Angeles and LA actually in Boyle Heights was the first and the east side local the mariachi's at mariachi Plaza Apartments they were getting a 80 percent rent increase and they actually pulled a rent strike and they actually won in getting it from 80 percent to a five percent rent increase for a collective bargaining agreement the the tenant set that he set local in Boyle Heights they protested at the landlord's Beverly Hills mansion you know he was getting scared that the people were sleeping outside of his apartment his mansion and you know these are these are real people who are or losing their homes and the thought is if you're going to come into our hood then we're gonna go to yours and so the LA tenants union is actually doing great work right now but you know that's why we need to repeal this law called kosta hawkins which limits rent control in california and so once we could get rent control then these people could stay in their apartment and credit for these rent increases okay and is that related to the neighborhood council board that you're on yeah so the neighborhood council board I'm on that so the neighborhood councils are the liaison between the community and the City Council like the mayor Garcetti and the City Council and from there we have $40,000 to use on our community there's neighborhood councils throughout LA and we're basically the the ears of the community and the voice so we tell the mayor and all that what are the big issues on and I'm in Koreatown and like I said in Koreatown the the big issues their housing as well so we always tell the mayor hey you know we need to enact the rent control we need more low-income housing we need to stop them approving all these market rate development so it all ties in together with the work that I do my biggest issues are probably housing homelessness and uh you know health care well houses a enormous issue in Los Angeles if Ana lived in your district you definitely have her vote so so I think that that might be a winning campaign strategy so that's interesting all right before we go one more priority for you so you got housing what else are you if you're in the United States Congress what else you gonna fight for I would like to get homelessness to be more of a national issue because it is a national issue and it's it's huge here in Los Angeles and thirty percent of homeless people nationwide our children and I think that we need to start changing this view on how we view homeless people eyes are see them as our neighbors our brothers and sisters get them in a permanent supportive housing get it things like single-payer health care so people can go is seek the help that they need that they have drug abuse or substance abuse or whatnot so that would be like another big issue that we definitely want to push on get more funding for a low-income housing and it's just you know those are the big things all right links to help Kenneth is down below in the description box if you're watching this on YouTube or Facebook and we just give him to you a little earlier all right Kenneth go get them thank you for joining us appreciate it appreciate
