savvy readers who are skeptical of mainstream media have become familiar with the style of journalism called just asking questions in which the author of a piece tries to push a narrative by asking leading questions jordan peterson fell victim to one of these on friday let's take a look progressive jewish outlet the foreword published a piece entitled is jordan peterson enabling jew-hatred which sports a picture of the University of Toronto professor slapped on top of one of Adolf Hitler but hey don't get all bent out of shape author Ari Feldman looks like a likable bloke and he's just asking questions and to answer those questions he's gathered the opinions of people who are not at all politically motivated like a professor and activists from the Southern Poverty Law Center and people for the American Way but first let's let Feldman set the tone a little bit the author mentions Peterson's April blog post in which the professor links Jewish over-representation in positions of power and competence to a higher Jewish IQ Feldman calls this argument an old anti-semitic dog whistle this is coming from the same sensible guy who called trump's nickname for hillary as amp america's Angela Merkel a dog whistle and thought Trump's shithole comment was supremely racist but Feldman doesn't address the obvious which is that anti-semitism doesn't lie in acknowledging IQ differences but instead in what people choose to do about those differences there's also some pretty priceless phrasing like this Peterson opposes Jew hatred he says and claims that leftist members of the media tried to hurt him by linking him to white supremacist right he says the forward interviews Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt who thinks Peterson's assertions are suspicious she says it's not Holocaust denial but when people start asking questions like that I begin to get leery what questions who knows Feldman seems to have clumsily admitted that part in his haste to publish and push his own views the question is is he a self-help guru who finds the Holocaust a convenient of attracting attention or is there serious thought going on here so Lipstadt seems to think that when Jordan Peterson argues that aspects of the human nature like revenge and disgust played a role in causing the Holocaust he undermines the role that anti-semitism played but it doesn't take more than a cursory youtube search to find that Peterson has discussed both no because you think well the Nazis were afraid of the Jews you know because they were other and that's not right what what's more accurate is that the especially Hitler he he he was he was very sensitive to discuss that's what it looks like and if you're disgusted by something then you want to eradicate it right if you're afraid of something you want to run away from it if you're disgusted by it you want to burn it to the damn ground you want to get rid of it he acts out the dark desire of the mob so he becomes the embodiment of the dark desire of the mob while Hitler came to embody the desire of the German people for order and revenge and he he embodied that fully you know and you could say so what happened was a collaboration between him and the people it wasn't Hitler turned everyone into Nazis it's like no that's not how it worked that's not exactly as a Southern Poverty Law Center director put it to the forward playing fast and loose with the Holocaust in fact I don't think Peterson whose YouTube is crammed with hours long lectures plays fast and loose with anything I spoke with the professor and he told me Feldman appears to assume one that anti-semitism is the true and final cause of the Nazi phenomenon and two that anti-semitism itself isn't a mystery worthy of explanation but anti-semitism is in fact a mystery and it was to solving that mystery and the issue of pathological tribalism in general that I devoted all 500 pages of maps of meaning Peterson noted that Feldman attempted to smear him by pointing to the professor's citation of the critique of professor Kevin McDonald who thinks Jewish people use a group evolutionary strategy but Peterson linked to an article refuting MacDonald's theory the professor continued as for his editors who dared to juxtapose me with a picture of Hitler there are certain comparisons you don't make lightly lest you dilute their malevolent symbol and you don't use such things as the most reprehensible of clickbait tactics and get to simultaneously pose as a noble supporter of the Jewish people listen lose are always going to latch themselves on to prominent public figures and contort those figures views to fit in further their conspiracies instead of trying to discredit people with guilt by association Feldman and the cherry-picked activists he cites can benefit from cleaning up their rooms and embracing this little thing called personal responsibility for a campus unmasked I'm Rob Simms Jacque if you like this
