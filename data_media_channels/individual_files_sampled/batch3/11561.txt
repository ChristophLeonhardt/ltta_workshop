a psychotherapist and gender specialist in the United Kingdom is challenging a university which is blocking research he wants to conduct in to people who regret undergoing gender change James Caspian claims that the move by Bath Spa University is an attack on free speech it's been extremely stressful to find myself embroiled in these proceedings which I think should be of great concern to anyone who values free speech and knowledge I deeply believe that the research I proposed is important to the well-being of the transgendered community it's a completely new topic and I'm sure that we have a plenty of persons who passed whole transition and then who showed any type of regret we have to research this more and more with only one aim that is to prevent mistake in in following these persons before surgery the research proposed by mr. Caspian was initially approved by academics back in 2015 but then was later dropped in December of 2016 High Court judges in the Universities favour ruled in the university's favor without waiting for an internal review of the study according to mr Caspian the university dropped the research because it feared there would be a backlash on social media we've reached out to battable University for comment mr. Cass pians research proposal was not refused on the grounds of topic but on the methodological approach the university was not convinced the approach would guarantee the anonymity of his participants and the confidentiality of data well the research had lost the first round of his legal battle they became to cover the university support costs he set up a crowdfunding page to cover the expenses and mount a fresh legal challenge against the university it so far raised almost 14,000 pounds get some wider perspective on the story now can speak to Walt hire who reversed his decision to become a woman appreciate you coming on Walt I'm sure you've got a fascinating perspective on on all of this now you refer to yourself as someone who's D transitioned back to male were you surprised that a university blocked research aimed at studying such a concept no I'm not surprised at all because if they start studying this like James Caspian wanted to do at the University what they would find out is there's a vast number of people who are D transitioning because they regret having changed their gender so I think they're fearful of the truth coming out and this is their way of preventing research from being done what do you make of explanation the university put forward they say the concerns that it could provoke nasty comments online well everybody's afraid of nasty comments aren't they but shouldn't we be really open to getting the truth and James is about to explore that and they really don't want the truth I think that's probably more the issue is that they're trying to prevent the truth from coming out and that's the backlash they're afraid of the LGBT which is so powerful it would probably overwhelm the university but James is on the right track even the surgeon who does the surgery who was on also saying that he's seeing a rise of people requesting D transition surgery the author of the research he mentioned that says the the reason that it was blocked was political the universities rejected those claims what's your take I think it's political absolutely I think it's totally political and I think there's a tremendous amount of pressure as I said from the LGBT I found out in my many years of working with transgendered people that there is a groundswell of people D transitioning I'm working with them all the time now more and more letters from around the world from people who after 5 7 12 maybe 15 even 20 years they want to D transition back calling the surgery and their gender change just pure folly and foolishness and totally unnecessary so they want help to D transition just as I've done speaking of your personal story you were born a male you later change gender live for 8 years as a woman as I understand then you changed back how difficult was it for you when you felt at that point you made a mistake or you wanted to change back and how happy do you feel about since having changed back to your birth gender well I feel quite good I've been back now to my birth gender for 25 years I've been married for 20 years you know when I discovered that that this hope that this whole transgender thing is built solely on feelings there's absolutely no objective proof that anyone is a transgender accepted by them self identifying as a transgenders no medical proof that anyone is a transgender and there's no proof that anyone benefits from the surgery over the long term now some people like myself feel like we had a good time while it lasted but when the truth rears its ugly head and that you really can't change your gender biologically that you're living this whole thing is just total foolishness and you want your life back you want to live in reality at some you know surgically made transgender life ud transition back and you take on a life of reality and you're much happier having done that Walt's very kind of you to come on and share your experiences would appreciate your time and your opinions my guess wold hire who transitioned himself back to male thank you thank you my pleasure
