earlier today many thousands of students across the country and in fact across the world participated in the national school walkout day that takes place on the one-month anniversary of the mass shooting at the Marjory Douglas Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in parkland Florida using the hashtag enough is enough the protest lasted 17 minutes 1 / 1 minute for each person murdered in parkland and I also saw I mean it was mainly a lot of high schools but elementary schools as well I believe I saw a tweet about one 2nd grader who was walking he was the only kid and there were none others so he went to the local high school and walked with them and he had a sign that said guns are cruel not cool and he was a second grader which is just amazing and so obviously they're doing this both to highlight the continuing need for action of which there has been extremely little there was a very mixed bill in Florida and earlier today the House passed just about the most weaksauce school violence prevention bill imaginable I'm assuming that many of the students that these marches want far more and they're making clear that they're going to continue their activism toward that and they expect politicians who stand in the way of that change to be held accountable in the primaries coming up and certainly in the general election later on today we have some more details about the breadth of these marches but Jake what's your what's your reaction so some folks that are superintendents principals across country are not allowed not allowing their students to March Barbara kanavan a superintendent in Hartford County Maryland said that instead she's going to do a learning module which sounds fun which allows them to speak about solutions in a structured way well that's part of the problem is that they keep telling everybody just stay within the lines stay within the lines and well within the lines have we gotten anything done no are we ever gonna get anything done no ok so people are tired of told being told to stay within the lines and just do as the establishment tells you and the elites tell you and everything's gonna be fine it's not gonna be fine it's not fine right now that's the whole point of the walkout and some administrators in these schools in fact I saw two different quotes on two different parts of the country saying how are you crazy we're gonna participate in this I mean you have the kids walk out and they'll be sitting ducks for shooters that might give you a sense of why you should do something about it how could you say that and then not realize the importance of the gravity of these walk outs that's precisely why they're walking out because you think it's a normal state of affairs that if you have students outside your school it's inviting a massacre you can't leave the castle shank obviously this is a fortress it's the only thing protecting our kids so thankfully they're not coloring inside of the lines and there were some schools I saw that had as I said one individual student who went out I know I saw Beattie had tweeted out a live streamed video of a student who he was the only one but he went there and some kids look some schools are super supportive of it and some are and the kids who are willing to go out there anyway that is exactly the type of team that we need in this country right now and and I totally agree with jank about the need to not listen to the administrators in this particular case I mean again all of this is basically happening because of the teens at the Stoneman Douglas school I think it's one of the reasons at least in my mind they should be considered so far the prohibitive favorites for Turk of the year so far because of what they've been able to accomplish and as we will talk about later on this is just the first in a series of upcoming major events actually and not too many more weeks we've got the big one in the March for four to save their lives in in DC but I want to talk about some of the particular marches very significant schools took place in Colorado students at Columbine High School they participated they did 30 seconds of silence 17 for the dead in parkland and 13 for the dead of their own campus which I believe is that night as I said 19 years ago there's coming up they're gonna have a march on that particular day too but what's amazing about that is that you have kids who are participating in that March at Columbine at the walkout who weren't born when Columbine but this is still a problem that we're trying to deal with them there's been almost no actual progress I mean hell at least when Columbine happened there was an assault weapons ban that lapsed several years later we don't have that again we seem unable to get that again but also walk outs were expected in Newtown Connecticut where 26 people were killed at Sandy Hook and there were also international marches I saw in London in Tanzania with one teacher at the tanzania school saying that thankfully we don't have an armed civilian population so we don't have to deal with this but they have empathy for those who do in Israel and Iceland one school had planned to but it was unfortunately too cold but we still appreciate the thoughts the Tanzania quote was the one that really struck me I'll give you the exact quote it was we are lucky to live in a country that is relatively gun free so it's not something our students have to think about said teacher Courtenay Park yeah so luckily they live in an African country like a zania where they are civilized and developed unlike in America where we have to worry about non-stop massacres of our children so that's the state of world affairs right now and that's no joke that's absolutely true so I mean the in Israel the internationals American International School they're also participated but if you think about it we're far less safe in America than students in Israel are so I think roughly the chances of getting hit by a rocket launched by Hamas is about 10,000 times less than the chance of being killed in a school shooting in America Ornish or in a mass shooting in America so look you could do the math on it yourself is what over 30,000 gun homicides a year in America the number of people killed by terrorism in Israel is far far far far far less my point isn't that terrorism isn't a real threat in Israel my point is that the gun violence in America is ten thousand times a greater threat to us and our kids and we go on about our lives like it's everything's fine right and we talk about a foreign terrorist no the thing you have to worry about is us terrorizing ourselves with guns at a scale that the world has never seen where are other countries like Tanzania look at us and go oh my god who'd want to live in a violent backwards place like America that's where we are right now and that's why they're doing the walkouts and that's why it's super important finally the Columbine was a huge marker for when we perceived the mass shootings at the schools to begin yeah the reality is there were school shootings before but it was on such a big scale that at the time we were not used to yeah and so I remember that day that was actually the very first day that I happened to be on TV yeah that's right because I my producers got pulled for me to cover Columbine and I had no idea what I was doing okay and so and people had bigger problems so that was 19 years ago and and now on April 20 they're gonna do another walkout this year yeah because of Columbine and and we got used to the massacres in the schools until Parkland where the students finally said we're not going to take it anymore because the adults aren't doing anything which then reminds me of what happened down in Florida when they were discussing this the piece of legislation again they did a tiny piece of legislation saying there should be a three day waiting period Wow and the age for assault weapons should be 21 rather than 18 okay these are minuscule changes that President Trump proposed universal background checks which overwhelming majority of Americans agree with including about seven out of ten NRA members say they should be universal background checks 78% of gun owners say there should be two ersal background checks and then also increasing the age to 21 and NRA said how dare you get back in line and Trump got back in line and withdrew those proposals and they control them completely and then one legislator had the audacity in Florida to get up and say these kids don't know what they're doing this is not the place for them the legislation is done by adults yeah well how's that going for us those corrupt adults who keep taking money from the NRA which gets it from gun manufacturers which literally profits off of the death of our kids how are the adults doing so far so in this case I'll take the kids over the adults any day if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot
