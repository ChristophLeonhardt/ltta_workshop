MAKING REMARKS ON MOTHER'S DAY
SPECIAL ALONG WITH MERCEDES
SCHLAPP AND KELLYANNE CONWAY.
>> TODAY SENIOR ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS WILL HOLD BRIEFING ON
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PLAN TO LOWER
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS.
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO REWARD
COMPANY THAT CONSTANTLY RAISES
PRICES.
DISCOUNTS SHOULD BE PASSED ONTO
CONSUMERS AND PATIENTS.
CARLEY: LATEST MOVE AS THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION TRIES TO FIX A
BROKEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, WHAT
ARE THE STEPS THEY'VE TAKEN,
HERE TO BREAK IT DOWN FOX NEWS
MEDICAL DR. MARK SIEGEL.
DOCTOR, WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TO
HAPPEN HERE.
WHEN MY PARENTS WERE SICK THEY
WERE ON 5 TO 10 MEDICATIONS AT A
TIME AND COULD BE EXPENSIVE
ESPECIALLY ON PEOPLE WITH FIXED
INCOME.
WOULD THEY SEE THE COST OF
MEDICATION DECREES?
>> ABSOLUTELY, CARLEY.
ALREADY POINTED OUT ONE OF THE
THINGS YOU WILL SEE THE
MIDDLEMAN WILL GET LESS TO HAVE
PROFIT, MORE TO HAVE SAVINGS
WILL COME TO THE PATIENT, LIST
PRICES OF DRUGS ARE SKY HIGH,
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OVER
$300 BILLION A YEAR IN THE
UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW.
FALSELY INFLATED LIST PRICES
LEADS TO MIDDLEMEN COMING IN AND
GOUGING OUT THEIR PROFIT BUT THE
PATIENT PAYS MORE OUT OF POCKET.
ALL OF THAT IS BEING CUT DOWN
ON.
THERE'S GOING TO BE LESS HIDDEN
PRICES, PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKED
ABOUT MORE PRICE TRANSPARENCY
WHERE YOU WILL KNOW WHAT
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ACTUALLY COST
AND REBATES WILL COME INTO PLAY
SO THAT PRICES WON'T BE AS
INFLATED.
AGAIN, LESS OUT OF POCKET
PAYMENT BY THE PATIENT.
CARLEY: YOU SAY COMPETITION IS
ALSO KEY.
>> WELL, COMPETITION IS KEY.
THIS IS HOW COMPETITION WILL
COME INTO THE EQUATION, MORE
GENERIC DRUGS APPROVED.
FDA IS WORKING ON THAT.
LEST YEAR OVER A THOUSAND NEW
DRUGS WERE APPROVED THAT WERE
GENERICS, MOST ON RECORD EVER,
WHY, IT'S GETTING EASIER AND
EASIER FOR GENERIC TO BE
APPROVED.
WHY DOES THAT BRING DOWN PRICES,
BECAUSE GENERIC DRUGS ARE
CHEAPER, INSTEAD OF BRAND-NAME
DRUG BEING ABLE TO HOLD TO THE
MARKET LONGER, CHEAPER DRUGS
WILL COME IN AND COST LESS, HUGE
IMPROVEMENT AND PRESIDENT TRUMP
IS DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT.
CARLEY: LET'S GET A GRAPHIC OF
WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN WILL
INCLUDE, LOWER DRUG COSTS FOR
SENIORS, PERSUADE OTHER
COUNTRIES TO PAY MORE, REQUIRE
PRICE SHOWN IN DRUG ADS AND BAN
GAG CLAUSES FOR PHARMACIES AND
END THE PATIENT GAINS.
THE ONE THING THAT I FOUND
INTERESTING, THE GAG CLAUSE
SITUATION WHERE PHARMACISTS
COULDN'T TELL ABOUT LOWER-COST
DRUGS, WHY DID THAT EVER HAPPEN
TO BEGIN WITH?
>> THAT'S IN BENEFIT OF
BRAND-NAME DRUGS.
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU
THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE.
CAN YOU IMAGINE AN ENTIRE
COUNTRY LIKE GERMANY COMES INTO
PLAY AND SAYS, WE ARE ONLY
PAYING THIS AMOUNT FOR YOUR DRUG
AND DRUG MANUFACTURERS SAY,
SURE, OKAY, YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF
CUSTOMERS, WE WILL ACCEPT THAT
AND PASS IT ALONG TO PEOPLE BACK
HOME.
THAT'S GOING TO BE ENDED NOW.
CARLEY: ALSO AMAZING HOW
EXPENSIVE DRUGS HAVE GOTTEN OVER
THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
IN 2006 AVERAGE ANNUAL COST OF
MEDICATION, $4,000, BY 2015,
THAT HAD TRIPLED TO NEARLY
$13,000, HOW COULD THAT HAVE
HAPPENED OVER SHORT PERIOD OF
TIME?
>> MANUFACTURERS SAY IT'S
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, THAT'S
THEIR EXCUSE, BUT THEN THEY ARE
PASSING THE COST ALONG TO US,
NOT ALONG TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES
AND YOU HAVE THE MIDDLEMEN THAT
COME AND PRICE GOUGE.
PRICE TRANSPARENCY.
SENIORS ARE BEING TARGETED TO
GET MORE BENEFITS.
CARLEY: YEAH, THOSE ARE THE
FOLKS THAT SHOULDN'T BE BECAUSE
A LOT OF SENIORS CAN'T REALLY
AFFORD IT.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF
PEOPLE CARE ABOUT BECAUSE IT
AFFECTS THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR
FINANCES, SO IF THE PRESIDENT
CAN REALLY, YOU KNOW, CHANGE THE
SITUATION, IT WILL BE A MAJOR
WIN FOR THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.
>> CARLEY, IF YOU'RE OVER 70
YEAR'S OLD AND ON FIXED INCOME
AND GOING TO PHARMACY, THE LAST
THING YOU WANT TO BE TOLD, PONY
UP ANOTHER 50 BUCKS, YOU DON'T
HAVE IT.
