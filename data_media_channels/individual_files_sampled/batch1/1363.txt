the atmosphere is upbeat but these farmers arrive in Mumbai with a serious message for the Indian government it's taken them five days in the hot Sun to march a hundred and eighty kilometres from the ancient holy city of Nashik stopping only for food and rest now they're determined to make their voices heard to state and federal government legislators we farmers are coming all the way from Nashik on foot the government is repeatedly promised but has not given us the land rights we will hold demonstrations outside the assembly until our demands are met yea we have a lot of demands the price of our produce should definitely increase farmers in India are having a tough time many have fallen into debt due to drought an increasingly erratic weather thousands involved in the farming industry commits suicide each year the farmers are demanding more government subsidies higher crop prices and for tribal farmers who mainly cultivate in forests to be allowed to own land they also say that strict conditions on a government loan waiver program excludes the vast majority of farmers the government should accept some of our demands in the past we have blocked roads try to fill jails but the government is unmoved with this long march we are determined to stay put outside the State Assembly till our demands are met we are ready to be put in jail the state government says it will appoint a six-member committee to look into the demands but that may be too little too late for many farmers who feel they've been ignored for too long and are impatient for change Victoria Gaytan be al-jazeera
