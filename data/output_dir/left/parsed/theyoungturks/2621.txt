WELL, AS AN EX-GIRLFRIEND OF
MINE ONCE SAID ñ
WE GOT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ON
THE RUN.
I DO NOT MEAN THEY ARE RUNNING
FROM OFFICE, I MEAN THEY ARE
RUNNING FROM OFFICE.
THE LATEST CASUALTY ñ RODNEY
FRELINGHUYSEN FROM THE STATE OF
NEW JERSEY, HE GOT WATCHED AND
CRUNCHED IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS.
LET'S EXPLAIN HIS DISTRICT AND
WHY HE IS NO LONGER RUNNING.
IF TRUMP ONLY ONE YOUR DISTRICT
BY ONE POINT IN 2016, YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?
THE NUMBERS
HAVE MOVED COMPLETELY.
NOW A GENERIC DEMOCRAT BEATS A
GENERIC REPUBLICAN IN
CONGRESSIONAL RACES AMONG LIKELY
VOTERS WITH AN ASTOUNDING 14%.
THEY ARE IN A WORLD 
OF TROUBLE.
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS LESS
POPULAR WAS THEIR HEALTHCARE
PROPOSAL WHICH PULLED AT 17%.
I WOULD SAY THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IS COMING FOR THEM EXCEPT
THEY DO.
I WILL GIVE YOU THE SENSE OF HOW
BIG THAT WAVE IS IN A SECOND.
BUT THERE IS ONE OTHER THING
GOING AGAINST THIS PARTICULAR
CONGRESSMAN, HE VOTED AGAINST
THE TAX CUTS.
HE DID IT FOR A VERY GOOD
REASON, IN HIS DISTRICT IN NEW
JERSEY TAXES ARE GOING TO GO UP
BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT WAS
STRUCTURED AND PUNISHES BLUE
STATES MORE AND TAKES IT OUT ON
THEIR REAL ESTATE ñ
SO IT HURTS HIS DISTRICT.
THAT IS PARTLY BECAUSE HE HAS
MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE IN IT.
SO HE VOTED AGAINST IT BUT THAT
MAKES THE BASE REALLY ANGRY
AND HENCE THE- CRUTCH.
HERE IS AN EXPLANATION.
THE
CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ñ
THAT IS A GIANT JOB, A REALLY
POWERFUL POSITION.
REPUBLICANS HAVE INSTITUTED TERM
LIMITS FOR THEMSELVES.
HE WAS NOWHERE NEAR THE
TERM LIMIT.
BUT HE SEES WITH HIS BASE GONE,
WITH MOST OF HIS VOTERS IN THE
DISTRICT ñ EVEN IF YOU MIGHT
LOSE A COMMITTEE ANYWAY.
LET'S GIVE YOU A SENSE OF
CONTEXT.
35 PEOPLE, THAT IS A RECORD.
AND WE ARE NOT ANYWHERE NEAR
THE ELECTION YET.
EVEN THE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR
OTHER OFFICE, FOR EXAMPLE A
REPRESENTATIVE IN ARIZONA NOW
RUNNING FOR THE SENATE.
SHE IS GETTING KILLED IN
HER OWN DISTRICT.
THE ONLY WAY SHE WINCES
MAYBE STATEWIDE.
A LOT OF THEM HAVE RESIGNED OR
RETIRED BECAUSE THEY REALIZE
THEY HAVE NO CHANCE OF WINNING.
BIG REPUBLICAN STALWARTS LIKE
DARRELL ISSA, GONE.
IF YOU FOLLOW POLITICS, NINE
COMMITTEE CHAIRS, AND FOR
IMPORTANT POSITIONS.
THE ONLY LEAVE WHEN THEY
HAVE NO CHOICE.
WE ARE JUST IN JANUARY 2018.
THAT BLUE WAVE, OR BLUE WEDDING
COULD BE ENORMOUS IN 2018.
IT'LL BE A GREAT DAY IN AMERICA
IF ON THAT NIGHT WE GET TO
CONCLUDE OUR BROADCAST WITH
PROGRESSIVES SEND THEIR REGARDS.
