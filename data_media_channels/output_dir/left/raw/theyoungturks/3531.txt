00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,439
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's so odd about him is that</font>

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,899
he's this cult of personality<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,370
though these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem you know</font>

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,170
manifestly<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear he is oddly able to</font>

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,910
string together<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right words in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">right way or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something and people</font>

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">respond to it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know yes I'm not sure</font>

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weird I think that he's</font>

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically only doing a couple things</font>

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course these are very</font>

11
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,570
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so there's huge lessons to</font>

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,490
be learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> and imagine if someone smart</font>

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,429
did these things right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so which is what</font>

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,230
was being said before the<font color="#CCCCCC"> election</font>

15
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was presuming that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't</font>

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,800
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to win the election like the next</font>

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,170
time a smart guy is gonna con you read

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,350
it's gonna be a clean car and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a con</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">or it doesn't have to be a con it like</font>

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,040
you could if you're a good guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,510
still do these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let me explain</font>

22
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">right one is run towards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the spotlight</font>

23
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,800
now I know a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good guys don't want</font>

24
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,000
to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it feels awkward and</font>

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">self-aggrandizing right but we're in a</font>

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,609
message war we're in an ideology war

27
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,070
we're in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> culture war it's true it's</font>

28
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,659
real right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if the left does not</font>

29
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">shirks away from the spotlight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

30
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're trying to be good guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

31
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,650
not helping anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

32
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,590
we need strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> voices that's part of why</font>

33
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,509
I really really like Nina Turner who

34
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,490
runs our revolution like she's not

35
00:01:20,490 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>
