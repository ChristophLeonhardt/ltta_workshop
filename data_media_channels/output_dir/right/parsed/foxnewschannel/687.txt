A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BRAVING VERY
WARM TEMPERATURES TODAY.
IN OTHER NEWS THIS WEEK, IN NEW
YORK A SHOCKING VICTORY OF
28-YEAR-OLD ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO-CORTEZ, OVER JOE CROWLEY,
SENT SHOCK WAVES THROUGH THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
IT COULD HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON
THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.
HERE TO WEIGH IN, ROLL CALL
POLITICS REPORTER, BRIDGET
BOWMAN.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
I WANT TO START BY PLAYING THE
SOUND BITE FOR YOU.
IT'S A LITTLE OLD.
IT PLAYED ON WEDNESDAY.
I THINK IT'S POIGNANT.
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO IT AND I
WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION.
>> THIS EXTRA JUDICIAL NATURE IS
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ABLE TO GET
AWAY WITH BLACK SITES AT OUR
BORDER WITH SEPARATION OF
CHILDREN.
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY BLACK
SITES.
>> WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN ARE
BEING KEPT AND HUMAN RIGHTS
ABUSES ARE HAPPENING WITHOUT ANY
WON THE PRIMARY.
SHE'S VILLAINIZING I.C.E. IN
THAT SOUND BITE.
THAT WAS MY TAKE-AWAY.
WE'RE SEEING THAT WITH OTHERS.
SOME ARE COMPETING IN THE
PRIMARIES.
WHEN YOU VILLAINIZE AN AGENCY
LIKE THAT, YOU START TO GET
EXTREME.
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
WE'VE SEEN ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO-CORTEZ SAID EARLY ON IN
HER CAMPAIGN SHE WAS FOR
ABOLISHING I.C.E.
THIS IS A POSITION SOME OTHER
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF
PEOPLE IN SWING DISTRICTS, IN
HOUSE RACES, THESE COMPETITIVE
I WOULD BE SKEPTICAL THEY WOULD
TAKE THOSE POSITIONS.
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CAST AS
EXTREMES OF THEIR PARTY.
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ WON IN
A VERY DEMOCRATIC DISTRICT.
SHE KIND OF CAN GO OUT THERE, BE
MORE LIBERAL THAN SOME OF THESE
FOLKS IN OTHER RACE AS WELL.
LIZ:  AS WE START SORT OF SEEING
THIS PRIMARY SEASON CONTINUE,
WHEN YOU SEE RHETORIC LIKE THIS
AND THEY ARE THE EXTREMES, DO
THE ESTABLISHMENT CHARACTERS,
LIKE NANCY PELOSI, DO THEY WANT
TO REIN THAT IN.
>> IT DEPENDS ON THE DISTRICT.
YOU SEE LEADERS LIKE LEADER
THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE THEY
DON'T SEE THAT AS A WINNING
MESSAGE, ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF
THE COMPETITIVE HOUSE RACES THAT
THEY'RE TRYING TO UNSEAT
REPUBLICANS.
THEY'RE TRYING TO TALK TO VOTERS
WHO SUPPORTED REPUBLICANS IN THE
PAST AND SAY TO
PAST AND SAY CO
PAST AND SAY CHOOSE A DEMOCRAT
INSTEAD.
THEY DON'T WANT TO GO FARTHER TO
THE LEFT AND I COULD SEE LEADERS
KIND OF PUSHING BACK ON THAT.
LIZ:  WE'RE LOOKING AT LIVE
PICTURES.
YOU SEE THOUSANDS IF NOT TENS OF
THOUSANDS, IF NOT HUNDREDS OF
THE FAR LEFT SPEECHES, YOU COULD
SAY CAMPAIGN SPEECHES TAKING
PLACE IN THESE RALLIES.
HOW FAR LEFT ARE DEMOCRATS GOING
TO BE GOING THIS SEASON?
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
I THINK TO THE EXTENT OF
COULD MAYBE ENERGIZE VOTERS,
ESPECIALLY LATINO VOTERS, A
BLOCK OF VOTERS THAT HASN'T
TRADITIONALLY TURNED OUT AS WELL
FOR DEMOCRAT AS THEY HOPED.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
WHAT REPUBLICANS DO ESPECIALLY
ON IMMIGRATION, SOME OF THE
DEMOCRATS -- SOMELY, SOME OF THE
-- SORRY, SOME OF THE
REPUBLICANS THAT YOU SEE PUSHING
FOR CONGRESS TO ACT ON
THIS ISSUE ARE FOLKS IN
DISTRICTS WITH HIGH HISPANIC
POPULATIONS, PEOPLE WHO SEE
INACTION AS SOMETHING THAT COULD
BE A PROBLEM FOR RE-ELECTION.
LIZ:  WHAT WAS YOUR BIGGEST
SURPRISE ASIDE FROM THE NEW YORK
RACE, WHICH WAS THE 14th
DISTRICT, WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST
SURPRISE ASIDE FROM THAT?
>> THERE WERE FOUR NEW YORK CITY
INCUMBENTS FACING DEMOCRATIC
CHALLENGERS.
THREE OUT OF THEM WON EXCEPT FOR
CROWLEY, OF COURSE, WHICH WAS
SORT OF INTERESTING.
ONE CONGRESSMAN LOST BY A -- WON
BY A SMALL MARGIN.
SO THAT WAS SORT OF SURPRISING.
OF THE NIGHT.
LIZ:  WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS
