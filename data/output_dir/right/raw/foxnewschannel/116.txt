1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,066
>> Bill: YOU SEE WHAT'S ON THE

2
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:04,634
LINE FOR THIS CAMPAIGN SWING.

3
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:05,802
OBVIOUS ON THE BOARD HERE WHEN

4
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:07,470
YOU TALK ABOUT THE BATTLE FOR

5
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:08,405
THE U.S. SENATE.

6
00:00:08,406 --> 00:00:09,906
BALANCE OF POWER NOW GOING INTO

7
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:13,076
A MID-TERM THAT'S 18 DAYS AWAY

8
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:15,178
IT'S 51 REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:15,879
AT 49.

10
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,280
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOUR STATE

11
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,682
SWING THROUGH MONDAY PUTTING

12
00:00:18,683 --> 00:00:23,753
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION FRONT AND

13
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:24,087
CENTER.

14
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:26,089
KAYLEIGH MCENANY WITH ME NOW.

15
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,724
WHAT'S THE STRATEGY ON

16
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:29,125
IMMIGRATION HERE?

17
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:30,427
>> THE STRATEGY IS TO PUT

18
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:32,162
IMMIGRATION IN THE FOREFRONT.

19
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:34,297
WE SAW A DEFINITIVE CHANGE IN

20
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:35,999
POLLING WHEN DEMOCRATS STARTED

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,701
CALLING FOR THE ABOLITION OF

22
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:38,368
ICE.

23
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:40,236
IN THAT MOMENT WHEN MAINSTREAM

24
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:41,604
DEMOCRATS CALLING FOR THE

25
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,006
ABOLITION OF THIS LAW

26
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:44,874
ENFORCEMENT ENTITY WE SAW IT

27
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,411
RISE TO PROMINENCE IN THE POLLS

28
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:49,245
MOTIVATING REPUBLICAN VOTERS.

29
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:51,081
79% OF TRUMP VOTERS SAID

30
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:52,315
IMMIGRATION WAS AN IMPORTANT

31
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:54,050
ISSUE IN THEIR VOTE.

32
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:55,218
THE LAWLESSNESS WE SEE

33
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:56,152
APPROACHING OUR SOUTHERN BORDER

34
00:00:56,153 --> 00:00:57,787
IS SOMETHING THAT IS SENDING

35
00:00:57,788 --> 00:00:58,988
GOP VOTERS STRAIGHT TO THE

36
00:00:58,989 --> 00:00:59,289
POLLS.

37
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,323
>> Bill: I WANT TO SHOW YOU

38
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:02,258
SOMETHING ON THE MAP WE'RE

39
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:02,625
WATCHING.

40
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:03,293
NO ACCIDENT YOU WATCH THE

41
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:05,061
TRAVEL AND THE TRIP OF THE

42
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:05,995
PRESIDENT AND THE VICE

43
00:01:05,996 --> 00:01:07,630
PRESIDENT, TOO, OVER THE COMING

44
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:08,798
THREE WEEKS.

45
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,901
IT WAS MONTANA LATE YESTERDAY,

46
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:13,303
GOOD MATCH-UP BETWEEN ROSENDALE

47
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,003
AND JON TESTER.

48
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:15,638
YOU SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID

49
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:17,040
TWO YEARS AGO IN MONTANA.

50
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,409
HE BEAT HILLARY CLINTON BY 20

51
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:19,743
POINTS.

52
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:21,511
POP HERE AND GO DOWN TO ARIZONA

53
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:23,046
WHERE THE CAMPAIGN RALLY WILL

54
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:25,248
HAPPEN A BIT LATER TODAY.

55
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:28,918
MARTHA McSALLY UP AGAINST THE

56
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:29,419
DEMOCRAT SINEMA.

57
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,921
YOU SEE WHAT HE DID TWO YEARS

58
00:01:31,922 --> 00:01:34,624
AGO, WON THE STATE BY FOUR

59
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,458
POINTS.

60
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:36,159
NEVADA DIFFERENT STORY.

61
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,027
DEAN HELLER IS RUNNING FOR

62
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:38,428
REELECTION.

63
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:39,696
THE ONLY REPUBLICAN ON THE

64
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:41,731
BALLOT IN A STATE THAT DONALD

65
00:01:41,732 --> 00:01:43,566
TRUMP DID NOT WIN.

66
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,034
HILLARY CLINTON WON BY 2 1/2

67
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:47,003
POINTS TWO YEARS AGO.

68
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:49,372
ON MONDAY IT IS TEXAS, SO YOU

69
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:52,842
HAVE QUITE CLEARLY ON THE MAP

70
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:55,178
BEHIND US, KAYLEIGH, YOU HAVE

71
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:58,281
AT LEAST ARIZONA AND TEXAS, TWO

72
00:01:58,282 --> 00:01:59,115
BIG BORDER STATES.

73
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:00,016
PRETTY OBVIOUS WHAT THE WHITE

74
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:01,584
HOUSE IS UP TO.

75
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:02,986
>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

76
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:05,088
THE RACES YOU POINTED TO PUBLIC

77
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:07,657
POLLING SHOWS THE REPUBLICAN UP.

78
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:09,125
AFTER THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS

79
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:10,560
AMID CALLS FROM VIOLENCE FROM

80
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:11,861
DEMOCRATS AND THE CARAVAN.

81
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:13,363
WE'VE SEEN POLLING SHIFT IN OUR

82
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:15,432
DIRECTION AND YOU'RE RIGHT TO

83
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:17,066
POINT OUT TEXAS AND ARIZONA.

84
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:18,802
IT IS VERY MOTIVATING FOR THOSE

85
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:19,202
TWO STATES.

86
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:21,271
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT WILL COME

87
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:23,506
UP IN TEXAS WITH TED CRUZ AND

88
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:25,241
ARIZONA WITH MARTHA McSALLY.

89
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:27,110
>> Bill: LINDSEY GRAHAM IS

90
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:27,744
HITTING THE TRAIL.

91
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:31,748
YOU CAN SEE TWO OF THE FOUR

92
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:33,383
BORDER STATES WERE WON BY

93
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:33,850
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

94
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,251
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS GOING ON THE

95
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:35,552
TRAIL.

96
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:38,788
PART OF HIS TRIP IS CLEARLY TO

97
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:41,124
REMIND VOTERS ABOUT THE

98
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,058
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION.

99
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:43,193
DO REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THEY'RE

100
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:45,061
LOSING THE BUMP IN THE

101
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:46,262
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION OF TWO

102
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:46,963
WEEKS AGO?

103
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:49,532
>> NO, WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT

104
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,934
BECAUSE POST KAVANAUGH BUMP WE

105
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:55,138
SAW A LOT OF INANE COMMENTS

106
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,539
FROM DEMOCRATS, HILLARY'S

107
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,607
COMMENTS ABOUT THE #METOO

108
00:02:57,608 --> 00:03:00,043
MOVEMENT AND HER HUSBAND NOT

109
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:01,211
ABUSING POWER.

110
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:04,814
ELIZABETH WARREN AND THE DNA

111
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:05,515
TEST.

112
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:06,683
ERIC HOLDER.

113
00:03:06,684 --> 00:03:08,084
THE LEFT WING GAFFES HAVE

114
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:08,451
CONTINUED.

115
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:09,819
WE HAVE TO REMIND VOTERS ABOUT

116
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,688
KAVANAUGH BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE

117
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,223
WE SAW DEFINITIVE TURN IN THE

118
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:13,556
POLLING.

119
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:21,498
LIBD

120
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:24,300
>> WELCOME BIDEN AND OBAMA ONTO

121
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:27,070
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

122
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:29,672
THE 2016 WAS A REJECTION OF THE

123
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:31,074
OBAMA PRESIDENCY AND BRINGING

124
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:32,909
THE ESTABLISHMENT ELITE ON THE

125
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,344
CAMPAIGN TRAIL HELPS US OUT

126
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:35,979
QUITE A BIT.

127
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,947
>> Bill: GEORGE BUSH IS GOING

128
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:39,015
TO INDIANA AS WELL.

129
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:42,151
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND

130
00:03:42,152 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'LL TALK AGAIN NEXT WEEK.
