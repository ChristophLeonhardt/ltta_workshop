begin with continuing fallout from the situation in parkland Florida obviously there's a horrific awful evil event that occurred last week in parkland and that's what Tom the news over the weekend President Trump is apparently now considering whether he is going to push some gun control measures one of the reasons he's doing that is because the media have launched an all-out emotional assault on gun control here is what CNN Fox News MSNBC been doing they've been covering all of the students from Parkland they're high school students and they're speaking out about gun control so here are some of the students announcing national demonstrations on gun control today I'd like to announce that we have an event coming up to have everybody in the nation talking about what we're talking about and one of the things we've been hearing is that it's not the time yet to talk about gun control and we respect that we've lost 17 lives and our community took 17 bullets to the heart and it's difficult to come back from that so here's the time that we're going to talk about gun control March 24th we have the March for our lives which you can find at March for our lives calm and expect to see us a lot the March for our lives is going to be in all every major city and we are organizing it so students everywhere can beg for our lives because at the end of the day this isn't about the red and blue the GOP and the Democrats this is about adults and kids now Who am I are you gonna beg for your life back Trump for your life as though Trump could just flip a switch and suddenly these shootings would not happen anymore it's that there's significant disagreement about the method that should be used in order to militate against these shootings and they're they're significant and real disagreements on this right I've suggested there ought to be wildly up security standards at all of these schools there ought to be armed guards at virtually every door that you might consider at some of these schools actually putting into place some some doors that that can actually close across the campus and lock like they have in hospitals in many hospitals they have lockdown procedures where somebody in active shooters in the hospital and so you actually lock off certain parts of the hospital from other parts of the hospital so that the shooter can't just walk through the halls with impunity and there's a lot of disagreement about this Democrats won of course bans on all sorts of weapons including the ar-15 which is the most popular rifle in the United States but this idea that it's all about begging that it's all about if we just cared enough that all of this would be be fine we just agree on everything that of course is not true in the slightest this of course however is what what the left is suggesting so the same student Cameron kasky he says you're either with us or against us which is pretty wild language we are all with you no one wants to see kids get shot you're either with us or against us we are losing our lives while the adults are playing around and we have received endless support from your generation and we thank everybody for that immensely because we really appreciate it we don't need you on March 24th you are going to be seeing students in every single major city marching and we have our lives on the line here and at the end of the day that is going to be what's bringing us to victory and to making some sort of right out of this tragedy I mean what what does victory look like what does victory look like that's the real big question okay if victory is no more shootings than we all agree on the definition of victory if victory is a piece of gun control legislation that may or may not actually help then we don't agree on what victory for the country looks like and you can see that some of these students obviously they're very politically motivated that's okay I mean they're allowed to have their political motivations my problem here is the same problem that I have with the country as a whole the country as a whole takes being on camera as some sort of imprimatur of of knowledge some sort of improvement or of expertise and that's really silly so LeBron James speaks about politics that's his right he's allowed to do it some of the stuff he says I think is not completely wrong but why would we treat as a country his version of politics with more credibility than people who have studied the issues and studied the personalities for a long time I don't and I don't think other people should why would we take a bunch of high school juniors and say that these are experts on gun policy now they're not experts on gun policy simply because their school is targeted these are people who have experienced significant pain and obviously we all stand with them in and more and with them in that pain they have it to a far greater degree I'm sure than anybody who's who's far away but that does not mean that what they are saying on politics has any more legitimacy or that it has any more expertise to back it and yet there's a reason the media does this right after after the Boston Marathon attacks did you see victims of the Boston Marathon attacks on TV every day stumping for a travel ban on Muslims of course he didn't after the Orlando shootings did you see victims of the Orlando students who are not left-wing going around and saying what we need here is a restriction on the number of Muslim immigrants from countries we can vet of course you didn't write the media go out of their way to put people on camera who are sympathetic this goes all the way back to the Sandy Hook shooting when Piers Morgan was attempting to do this routine and I and I called him on and on air it's highly irritating to me and it's intellectually dishonest but there's a reason that all these kids are being put on TV and to put pressure to the idea by the way that a child shall lead them when it comes to politics is silly and then the idea that the children are our experts on policy because they have greater innocence no that means that they don't know enough there's a reason that you don't let seventeen year olds to find tax policy and you shouldn't let seventeen year olds to find gun policy either depending on whether they've actually studied the issue in any significant way but again the media have a real interest in trotting out these kids here's another student talking about how Trump sickens sickens the student president Trump you control the House of Representatives you control the Senate and you control the exam he doesn't you haven't taken a single bill for mental health care or gun control and passed it and that's pathetic we've seen a government shutdown we've seen tax reform but nothing to save our children's lives are you kidding me you think now is the time to focus on the past and not the future to prevent the death of thousands of other children you sicken me Trump sickens him okay well again Trump does not control the house he does not control the Senate I mean basic civics education would be useful here these are independent branches of government and they have to propose and pass legislation Democrats would filibuster presumably a lot of legislation Republicans would propose and Republicans are not gonna propose legislation that their base doesn't want and that their voters don't want this is how a republic works again the reason the media are going back to the well here is because they're attempting to create an impetus for action that there is no political impetus for right now this is aimed at the public it's not really aimed at Trump or even the legislators it's aimed at the general public the suggestion being that if you disagree with these students and if you don't feel their pain in the same way that they do and by feel their pain we mean agree with them then that means that you are obviously an uncaring individual there's another student doing this routine yesterday not because we are going to be another statistic about mass shootings in America but because as just as David said we are going to be the last mass shooting okay but here's the reality that's probably not true and none of the gun control man I mean it's an unfortunate reality but none of the gun control measures that are currently being proposed by the Democrats would have stopped what happened in parkland I've yet to hear a concrete proposal you heard one I haven't heard any concrete proposal none right this piece of crap who shot up the school had smoke grenades on him we still don't know how he got the smoke grenades do you think would have been a bit had been impossible for him to go through and shoot all these students with a handgun that's right that's what the student at Virginia Tech use used a handgun in that shooting so blaming me the ar-15 is is not going to stop these these mass shootings again all of this is about generating emotional appeal not about making a logical appeal but the real goal here is to is to get politicians in front of these kids so these people can great the the politician so Marco Rubio is falling for this he's gonna go talk to the victims on camera in front of CNN it's not our job to tell you senator Rubio how to protect us the fact that we even have to do this is appalling our job is to go to school learn and not take a bullet you need to figure this out that's why you were unfortunately elected your job is to protect us and our blood is on your hands okay our blood again our blood is on your hands I mean only if you think that the government has gotten can prevent every single thing or unless you get a piece of legislation that is backed by evidence and can suggest that there will be no more mass shootings if you pass this piece of legislation and then then we can actually have a conversation but here's the truth we know why this shooting took place we know what failed here we know what went wrong here and I'll explain to you in a second what exactly that was and it was not lack of gun control I'll explain that in one second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors

total control over guns in order to stop mass shootings like what happened at Parkland but we found out that the government won't do that okay we found out the FBI knew full well about the shooter in the parkland Florida School massacre and did nothing two times to first they were informed in September the YouTube user with the shooters real name said quote I'm going to be a professional school shooter I'm not sure what you need more than that to go and check it out the FBI didn't mean for it to the field office didn't bother to share the information with local authorities now The Wall Street Journal reports that in January a caller told the FBI specifically about the shooters quote gun ownership desire to kill people erratic behavior and disturbing social media posts as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting what happened nothing it was ignored it was not even forwarded to the field office so when we talk about the government is is big enough to save us the government's big enough to protect us there are thousands and thousands of people in this country right now who have felons who have guns and the government knows about them and is doing nothing there are thousands of people who are in the mental health roles and they have guns and the government is doing nothing about them and you're telling me that a mass gun confiscation is the way that you're gonna take care of this or even forgive him a march in the street that somehow this is going to accomplish the end of this one of the ways that we could actually militate against this there are two ways that I would propose maybe three that would that would actually mill I can actually name I think maybe four things that we could do then militate against all of this so first thing that we could do is the media should stop naming shooters and providing glory to the shooters when we do this stuff all we ends up doing is promoting this these are copycat crimes the huge number of the school shooters our fans of Columbine have downloaded information about Columbine become obsessed with school shootings and want to imitate it so you get their name in the papers the media should have an agreement all the way through and we're gonna start implementing this is daily wire now I do it on my show then we're not going to name the shooter that is something that I think everyone should work on in the media that's something that we can do first ten second thing we should have massive security the schools this idiotic notion that there is a school to Prison Pipeline is not backed by data that if you have a bunch of armed guards in the schools then kids are being arrested for silly crimes and then being sent to prison it's just not true the data do not support that we had a whole article by Hank Berrien over at the Daily wire about this you can go and check that out it is not the case the other things that we can do the mental health screenings that are already taking place there need to be more transparency all this information needs to be transmitted to local authorities it all needs to be put in the databases people need to be fired or lose their jobs or lose their careers if they do not enter information that is relevant and then something terrible happens because I promise you for every school shooting that happens like this were the FBI missed it there are a hundred other instances where the FBI missed it but there was no school shooting if this happened once this happened a hundred times we've now had the FBI and the CIA missed things in the San Bernardino shooting in the Texas shooting in this shooting in the Charleston shooting the government is not doing what they are already hitting what they already have the power to do so that's something that we certainly should be taking a look at so that those are those are three things right off the bat that we should be looking at David French has a proposal over at National Review that is called the gun violence restraining order and what he suggests I want to find the the actual verbiage so he says that what we should do here is we should have gr vos he says there are various versions of these laws working their way through the states California passed a gr vo statue in 2014 and it went into effect in 2016 broadly speaking they permit a spouse parent sibling a person living with a troubled individual to petition a court for an order enabling law enforcement to temporarily taken individuals gun rights away a well-crafted GVR ocean the following elements quote it should limit those who have standing to seek the order to a narrowly defined class of people at close relatives people living with the respondent and should require petitioners to come forward with clear convincing admissible evidence the respondent is a significant danger to himself or others it should grant the response and an opportunity to contest the claims against him in the event of an emergency an ex parte order in order granted before respondent can contest should be scheduled fairly a full hearing should be scheduled quickly if there's an ex parte order and the order should lapse after a defined period of time almost petitioners can come forward with clear and convincing evidence that it should remain in place so this should this would be something that we could all agree on across the board these seem like reasonable gun control measures to me and they're not just gun control measures their societal societal control measures in the sense that they are restrictions we place on ourselves in order to try and tamp down the possibility of violence here unfortunately we're not going to have real conversations about all of this we're just going to shout at each other about how we don't care enough and chief among those people shouting is of course neil degrasse tyson - neil degrasse tyson is very angry when people talk about praying for the victims or praying for the families of the victims he says quote evidence collected over many years obtained from many locations indicates that the power of prayer is insufficient to stop bullets from killing schoolchildren okay evidence gathered from all over the world from many locations across thousands of years indicates that no religious person in history has ever claimed that prayer stops people from shooting other people there's not a religious person in America who actually believes that if I pray school shootings will end nobody thinks that but the left is fully intent on using school shootings as a club to wield against their favorite political enemies a Steven Pinker whose book I'm going to talk about a little bit in things I hate I talked about his things I like last week and then I actually had a chance to read it and I'm gonna talk about things I don't like about it but Steven Pinker is a psychologist over at Harvard and he was talking about atheism on MSNBC and suggesting that the that we should quit it with all of the put it with all of the religion talk because obviously God doesn't exist all of which really cast doubt on the idea that there's a benevolent Shepherd who looks out for human welfare I mean what was the benevolent Shepherd doing in Florida while that teenager was massacring his classmates so I don't you know I don't right in order to win popularity contests and I say many things some of which readers will agree with which they'll disagree with I assume that readers have enough sophistication to evaluate different propositions they may disagree with me on some things and that that's fine okay so this is the problem of theodicy okay theodicy is the problem that has been literally considered thousands of times by thousands of different religious thinkers why would a good God allow bad things to happen I do love it when people who are on the Atheist Left simply declare that the problem of theodicy is unsolvable and therefore God doesn't exist as though their mind is God's mind bad things happen therefore God doesn't exist if you're using a school shooting to make the case against God let me suggest that your priorities are misplaced one of the things that can help here might be a society that takes virtue more seriously that inculcates manhood more seriously as opposed to a society of atomized individuals who apparently have no responsibility for one another maybe maybe that's where we should start when we have these societal discussions but again it's all taking advantage Bernie Sanders taking advantage of the gun control debate in order to push his agenda even though Bernie Sanders is voting right on guns is actually a lot softer than a lot of other Democrats of course we have to make it harder for people to be able to purchase weapons we have people now who are on a terrorist watch list who can't purchase a weapon does this make any sense to anybody bottom line here Republicans are gonna have to say that it's more important to protect the children in this country than to antagonize the NRA are they prepared to do that I surely hope they are weird I can mean cuz Bernie Sanders has said this quote folks who do not like guns are fine but we have millions of people who are gun owners in this country 99.9% of those people obey the law I want to see a real serious debate and action on guns but it's not going to take place if we simply have extreme positions on both sides I think I can bring us to the middle and yet there's no proposal there there's just casting aspersions at people with whom he disagrees which is quite gross again all of this is silly and you see John Kasich doing the same thing John Kasich one of the more gutless politicians in my lifetime the governor of Ohio who had a pretty pro-gun record when he was in Congress and had a pretty pro-gun record as governor of Ohio now of course he's coming out and saying we should ban ar-15s why should we be any ar-15s what's here's some of the worst logical running here today from the insufferable John Kasich he said if all of a sudden you couldn't buy an ar-15 what would you lose would you feel as though your second Amendment rights would be eroded because you couldn't buy a God darn ar-15 these are the things that have to be looked at and action has to happen before and look you're never gonna fix all of this but common sense gun laws make sense okay common sense will that I've never heard circular logic like that before common sense gun laws make sense Thank You definitionally idiotic human gum the question is what is a common-sense gun we'll have an evidence backed gun proposal how about that same evidence backed gun proposal make sense not common sensical most common sense is very often the last reserve of people who don't actually want to do the field work of having to look up the evidence common sense if they comment when people say common sense isn't so common that's because common sense he would actually involve you looking at the evidence in the making a policy proposal based on it by the way the verbiage sure is so stupid the idea that you know here he is saying if I can't buy an ar-15 do I feel like my second amendment gun rights have been violated well if I didn't have to listen to John Kasich when I feel like my First Amendment rights have been violated actually yes I don't like John Kasich but if I couldn't listen to John Kasich my first amendment rights would be being violated I have a right to hear what he has to say what we like and what we don't is not the measure of a right what we like and what we don't is a measure of preference I'm a question of right is what I have a right to do and what I have a right to have I don't have to take advantage of that right in order for that right to exist I have a right to sleep with as many people as I want to in the United States I'm not going to do that I don't like me I don't like people who do do that but I have a right to do that I have lots of rights in the United States then I don't take advantage of a John Kasich apparently thinks that if a right doesn't of if defeat the calibration of a reduction of a right does not affect me then somehow it's not a reduction of a right that of course is completely evidence less and foolish but that's the that's the nature of this debate evidence listen foolish is I think what it comes down to in the end may as we continue here we're gonna talk about Trump Russia and the Muller Robert mullet brought down an indictment on Friday that does some serious damage to the Democrats claims that he was colluding with Russia we'll talk about that in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my patreon supply so I saw a report today and over in Puerto Rico there are now five months past the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico and a lot of folks still don't have food a lot of folks still don't have water or electricity the fact is the can't do what the

good thing and so go over my Patriot supply right now I'm prepared with been calm is prepared with been calm okay so quick update on Trump Muller stuff so the Trump Muller investigation continues to unspool and it is not providing the sort of evidence that Democrats who wish that it would provide on Friday the Muller investigations grand jury indicted thirteen Russians associated with election meddling but that was not the real headline the real headline is that among all of this activity nothing all that serious seems to have occurred I'm just gonna be frank about this it doesn't look like any of this weight anything have him do with the election none of this looks particularly damaging and beyond that none of it had to do with the Trump campaign apparently knowing about what was going on with Russia at all the indictment targets 13 Russian nationals three Russian entities the government says we're utilizing quote information warfare during the election cycle according to the indictment these people quote supported the presidential campaign of then candidate Donald Trump and worked on disparaging Hillary Clinton but after Trump's election according to the same indictment quote defendants and their co-conspirators used false us personas to organize and coordinate other false us personas to or to organize and coordinate US political rallies protesting the results of the 2016 presidential election one of those rallies actually included a Trump is not my president rally held on November 12 2016 in other words is the Russians trying to make trouble during the election not necessarily backing Trump per se so what about election coordination with the Trump campaign here's what the indictment says quote some defendants posing as US persons and without revealing the Russian Association communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities folks that's not collusion collusion you actually have to know who you're talking to if I I don't understand the argument that this is collusion if I were to call up the Trump campaign and say I wanted to a rally for you in Texas and they say sounds great let's do a rally in Texas and I'm not Russian then it's not collusion if I am Russian and I say let's go to a rally in Texas and they don't know that I'm a Russian agent then how is it collusion it's only collusion if they know they're forwarding the agenda of the of the Kremlin if the Kremlin's agenda is that is the Trump victory that's not Trump's fault Trump's victory is his own agenda the logic that you did something and it happens to be coincident with something the Russians wanted not that you coordinated with Russia and that's collusion still that logic does not hold so what exactly did all of these organizations do they created quote certain fictitious u.s. personas into leaders of public opinion in the United States like what they created the ematic group pages including black Davis secured borders an army of Jesus and they created Twitter accounts like 10 GOP which ended up with more than a hundred thousand followers by the way that's the extent of what they did that they created one Twitter account that was successful and 100,000 followers you know many people have accounts of 100,000 followers a lot you know many people have accounts with over a million followers not all that many about 1.2 million followers right now if the Russians really wanted to pour resources into Twitter you'd figure they would get one account that was really really influential 100,000 followers it's not all that influential so who did they support quote they engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and to support Bernie Sanders and then candidate Donald Trump they encouraged us minority groups not to vote in the 2016 US presidential election or to vote for a third party u.s. presidential candidate so pushing for Jill Stein and against Hillary Clinton it sounds like they didn't like Hillary very much and sounds like it was more anti-hillary than pro Trump per se but regardless the there is no evidence of actual Trump Russia collusion in these indictments now could there be evidence that appears later sure but we're still waiting to see some rigged gates is a member of the Trump campaign who's now gonna be indicted looks like he's gonna be indicted on charges having nothing to do with Trump looks like it has to do with corrupt activities with regard to Ukraine and Paul Manafort so so thus far we've had zero evidence that the Trump campaign actively colluded with the Russians the best that they can do is say there was intense clued that would be the meeting between Donald Trump jr. and Russian lawyer vessel Mnet's kya and Natalya vessel Mnet's kya and the exchange that Trump jr. had with a friend of his in Russia who was saying the Russian government wants to help out so intent to collude is not a crime actual collusion is probably not a crime actually depending on how exactly it went down but the the story we've been told for over a years that the Russians skewed the election to Hillary Clinton and then the evidence they provide for this is really scanty they putting up memes on Facebook that have 15 shares putting out dumb memes that have a hundred shares on Twitter one Twitter account that successful enough to have a hundred thousand followers that's it so Trump rightly comes out and starts blasting away against the Democrats for all of the Trump Russia stuff in an epic tweet storm he says Russia started their anti US campaign in in 2014 long before I announced that I would run for president the results of the election were not impacted the Trump campaign did nothing wrong no collusion fact check true and then he says charges deals on a big win written by Michael Goodwin of the New York Post succinctly shows the Russians had no impact on the election results there was no collusion with the Trump campaign she lost the old-fashioned way by being a terrible candidate case closed again fact-check true this is deputy AG rod Rosenstein stated at the press conference quote there's no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity there's no allegation in the indictment that the charged cons ought to altered the outcome of the 2016 election yeah Chuck true he continues in the funny how the fake news media doesn't but doesn't want to say that Russian group was it was sorry was formed in 2014 long before my run for president maybe they knew I was gonna run even though I didn't know it first of all a lot of the fake news media did and the fact check false the fake news media did actually point out that this that this interference started in 2014 and then he says I've seen all of the Russian ads and I can say definitively that swing the election was not the main goal Rob Goldman vice president of Facebook ads fact check true so that all of this is true this is very sad and now here's where he goes off the rails here's where Trump cannot help but be Trump and it's not good many tweets quote very sad the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter this is not acceptable they're spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign there is no collusion get back to the basics and make us all proud this is stupid this is counterproductive there is this is very dumb that last comment there the FBI agents responsible for stopping the school shooting we're not the FBI agents who are investigating Trump brush collusion that is a very very stupid comment it's it's a comment that devan's linking those two issues is really gross and nasty and vulgar and Trump never should have done it they said quote I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said it may be Russia or China or another country or group or maybe a 400-pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer the Russian hoax was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia it never did well that's really not true either the president said over and over and over that he doesn't really believe that Russia meddled in the election he said that Vladimir Putin keeps telling him and he sees no reason not to believe him that Russia didn't meddle in the election he's expressed his doubts about Russian meddling a thousand times but with all of this said you know the president can't help himself he gets on Twitter he says silly things it's what he does for a living aside from being president but with all of that said really this the the the basic notion promoted by the Trump by the Trump Mueller investigation the new and the new allegations put out by the Muller investigation it basically suggests that Trump is not wrong here there's there's never been a lot of strong evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign in the Russians and the media that keep trying to push this story are gonna have some real trouble if they continue to push this story the Trump can be as dumb as you wants on Twitter and he will but that has nothing to do with the underlying accusation made by the media which is that Hillary Clinton didn't lose the election the Russians wanted for Trump there is no evidence of that whatsoever any suggestions the contrary is evidence free okay so in just a second we're going to get

sports and politics but in order for me to lead this off I do have to discuss the worst national anthem in the history of national anthems this of course was from Fergie who gave the national anthem a black guy get it get it she gave it a black guy Fergie yeah fer gie as i make the joke again in case you missed it the first time because it's so good fer gie LIC i OMG WTF here it is Fergie singing the worst national anthem of all time watch the reactions of the NBA players who are listening to her Nealon would have done less dishonor to the anthem than the way that Fergie sang this national anthem it's just horrifying I'm never gonna cut it man I'm just gonna let it play it's so good in the world like what is going on man everybody's trying so hard not to laugh at this lady them trying to LeBron trying to hold in the laughs he's really trying hard there it comes to a point in this clap where the entire the entire crowd actually starts laughing we have to wait at least I'll get draymond greens reaction oh no and she's a terrible singer tear okay watch Trayvon here is the best wait till they get to draymond Green it's so good so terrible candles it in Jimmy and I are on the same side here what the hell is this oh so great okay everybody's laughing now they can't hold it in oh the capper is so good I think we can all come together around Fergie is awful oh my goodness that is just hot garbage Roseanne Barr finally gets off the schnide because of Fergie Wow Wow Carl Lewis off the schnide if you know if you haven't seen them sing the anthem by the way go to you who've been looking up pretty spectacular yeah I'm about this how about we just sing the national anthem like it was supposed to be sung as opposed to Marilyn Monroe singing happy birthday to JFK while having sex with him how about we don't do that with the national anthem because that was not good Wow okay now the sports community has decided that it is imperative that they all speak up on politics very very important that if you are good at basketball please speak up I'm pilot so now it's fine you wanna speak up in politics everyone in the United States has the right and the capacity to speak up on politics whether we should respect your opinion is another question lots of people have very dumb opinions so among those who have very stupid opinions is Adam rip on so Adam rip on is a is an ice skater and he says that quote I'm not like a gay icon or America's gay sweetheart I'm just America's Sweetheart and I'm just an icon so Milo yeah innopolis coming back as an ice skater there uh did this this well he finished tenth like tenth okay no finished tenth in the NFL last year it was the Atlanta Falcons with the ten and six record the Jacksonville Jaguars also were ten and six this does not make you an icon if you finished tenth that does not make you an icon but the media are so perverse that they actually moved to give a damn rip on a job as a commentator after finishing tenth at the Olympics can you name the person who finished 10th at the last Olympics you can't you know why because they're not an icon definitionally you finished 10th at the Olympics are not an icon so NBC briefly hired him to serve as a correspondent for the rest of the 2018 games in Pyeongchang South Korea he's one of the first openly gay athletes to compete at the Olympics and he won a bronze medal for a figure skating at some point I guess will work for NBC as a correspondent on TV digital and social media the only reason they're even talking about having him first of all anyone who thinks that he's a gay icon in figure skating um guys we're Brian Boitano have you watched the figure-skating coverage at all I haven't but if you have then you've seen Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir hey Johnny Weir is dressed like Lady Gaga every day commenting and commentating on this I mean that guy is ten times as gay as Adam Ripon or at least if you're if you're talking about gay stereotypes he is stereotypically gay much more than Adam rip on he is a gay he's a gay icon okay Johnny Weir was much more of a gay icon than Adam Ripon but Adam rip on ripped on mic pens and therefore he is therefore he's a gay icon now for some odd reason the media wished to prop up these cultural figures because they think that the American people actually listen to them the American people don't listen to them other people who the American people don't really care about hearing from on politics is a general rule LeBron James so LeBron James can say whatever he wants on politics Laura Ingraham when she said shut up and play basketball ell LeBron James can say whatever dumb thing he wants that's his prerogative but LeBron James responded to Laura Ingraham and so now we're gonna have a LeBron James Laura Ingraham fight for no apparent reason which is just awesome for the culture here's LeBron oh definitely not shut up and dribble I would definitely not do that I mean too much to to society I mean too much to the youth I mean too much to the to so many kids that feel like they don't have a they don't have a way out and they need someone to help lead them out of the situation they're in and that's why I would not just shut up and dribble because I mean too much to my two boys here their best friend right here my daughter that's at home my wife my family and all these other kids that look up to me for inspiration okay that's his prerogative that's his prerogative and it is worth pointing out people were saying this is a race thing hey joy Reid came out and she said that it's just that Laura Ingraham wanted to slam a black guy that's why the Laura Ingraham did this yeah this is ignorance here's where I read had to say extent to which Fox News has decided that the the grist for the ratings mill is black people right black NFL players black NBA players I mean you had eminem make a music video attacking Donald Trump that's not interesting to them right the grist is always black and brown people because they know what it sells and yet you have Laura Ingraham taking such umbrage and saying oh how dare you say my my words were racist um her words weren't racist she wrote an entire book it was a New York Times bestseller called shut up and sing about the Dixie Chicks the Dixie Chicks last I checked are the whitest people on planet Earth and she wrote an entire book about how people who are in the music business should shut up and sing in the her home has been Laura schtick for a very very long time it let's let's at least be honest about the critiques that were making of people if you think that Laura Ingraham shouldn't have said the LeBron James who shut up and rebel because you think that everyone has a right to speak that's fine but if you want to say that that's a racist thing Laura Ingraham has been saying this about every celebrity that she can find for the last 15 to 20 years I know I was there but joy Reed wants to say it's a racial thing also the idea that Fox News is is somehow ignoring the Eminem music video they covered the me time and I mean I was on Fox and Friends I think the morning they covered it they've covered the M in a music video over and over and over again then they covered the Snoop Dogg music video one of the reasons that they keep covering quote/unquote black folks in it in in athletics is because it's a lot of black folks in athletics who are becoming very political these days because they think that Trump is racially biased and they think Trump's a racist and all the rest of it the vast majority of players who are kneeling for the anthem in the NFL were black the vast majorities and players and in the in the NBA who are wearing black lives matters t-shirts were black because the vast majority of players in the NBA are black it's not that Fox News is this this attempt to graft racial issues onto what are really political issues I don't like very much another note about LeBron LeBron says I'm too important to people not to speak up but that may be true there are a lot of people who find LeBron James very important and they want to hear from him that may be true in the same way that it was true for Muhammad Ali I don't like making sports figures into coach into political figures because I don't think they know very much about politics as a general rule the mistake that Laura Ingraham made here was suggesting if she made a mistake her it was suggesting that innately LeBron James is not capable of talking about politics because he's a basketball player as opposed to he doesn't know what he's talking about therefore we shouldn't pay any attention and the problem isn't LeBron speaking out the problem is a society that takes celebrities seriously on politics how do I know that our society takes celebrities seriously on politics the President of the United States is Donald J Trump okay yes we take our power our celebrity seriously on politics it's store on the right and it's true on the left you can't critique LeBron for speaking out on politics if you were willing to vote for a Kid Rock in the US Senate race in Michigan you can't talk about how you don't like celebrities talking about politics if you are excited every time Clint Eastwood makes a political statement if he it doesn't work from one side and not for the other and on the left you can't whine about Donald Trump is a celebrity what does he know about politics if every time a celebrity comes forward like Lena Dunham whining about abortion you take her super seriously because she writes a terrible show on HBO either either we're gonna have to judge people based on their expertise or we're gonna have this whole other ancillary set of gauges that we use for determining legitimacy how close were they to a stage so we'll use sympathy how close were they to a situation that affected them or we'll use celebrity as a marker of decency and genius or we could say well does this person know anything about what they're talking about and if the answer is no then maybe we shouldn't as a people take them particularly seriously maybe Adam rip ons take on politics is not particularly relevant because anna pun doesn't know what the hell he's talking about he went on national television and suggested that the vice president of the United States is for gay conversion therapy which is factually false maybe we shouldn't offer him a slot on ice skating coverage so he can do his pull up his politicking at NBC by the way they withdrew the offer apparently after there was some blowback the reason that people are up in arms about sports and politics is because there's been a whole set of media elites who have decided that sports figures and cultural figures have something deep to say and you see it every time there's one of these controversies and a bunch of people come out and say where's Taylor Swift on this issue where's Taylor Swift been on me - where's Taylor Swift pin on the pussy hats who cares what Taylor Swift has been on any of this she writes papí teen beat songs who cares why does it matter where she is on this why would I possibly care what a boxer has to say about this stuff unless the boxers actually spent some time learning about the political issues at issue there are boxers by the way who spend time on politics I mean is it Vladimir Klitschko the the heavyweight or his brother who is very involved in Ukrainian politics but the mark of expertise should not be how many cameras are on you on an ancillary thing the mark of expertise should be whether you actually know what the hell you're talking about Jennifer Lawrence by the way says she's taking off time from acting - to change the to save our democracy so she apparently thinks The Hunger Games is a real thing she's gonna go get her bow and arrow and run out there if the previews for red Sparrow were any indicator then think we've all been blessed by her decision but Jennifer Lawrence why are we paying attention to her on politics who cares what Jennifer Lawrence has to say on politics the answer is no one should because she doesn't know what she's talking about but we all will because celebrity now dominates the roost okay time for some things I like some things I hate and then we will get to a federalist paper so things I like we could really do a thing I like and a thing I hate together for Black Panther because it is it is really some of both so I saw Black Panther over the weekend it is a very good Marvel movie I am NOT a Marvel fan I am a DC / Marvel guy I I have to analyze it on on two levels the the Black Panther it film so one is the movie level is it a good movie the answer is yes I think it's a good movie I think it's a well-made movie I think it's compelling I found the characters interesting I thought the story moved yeah I I liked the movie I thought that was better than most of the Marvel movies that I've seen recently I think it probably fall I said top three and you probably fall top five for me now in terms of the Marvel films I think what do they made 17 of them now I mean a bunch of them the my top 5 Marvel films this would be on there I really like to throw Ragnarok it didn't take itself too seriously that would be on there ant-man would be on there I know them I'm in the minority believing this ant-man would be on there I really like dr. strange without dr. strange yeah they have a weird Marvel list of movies that I like and they tend to be lighter Black Panther is heavier and I think that it's pretty good for that so it's well made the acting across the board is really good except for Forest Whitaker bizarrely who plays the same character in every film now so Forest Whitaker has basically become the guy he played in rogue one and he's like that in every single science fiction film he's kind of like Jeff Goldblum that way when you cast Forest Whitaker you know you're getting Forest Whitaker you're not gonna get really a performance but everybody else in the film is great Michael B Jordan steals the film as the villain kill monger he's the best thing in it but the performance is across the board are quite good okay so that's level number one is the film good that's what so things I like I like that that's good it's a good film so we can show a little bit of preview and then I will explain some things about the film that I did not like tell me something what do you know about Kenda is the third world country textiles Shepherds cool outfits or front explores has searched though it called it El Dorado thank for it in South America I'm the only one okay so the movies good Andy Andy Serkis by the way is terrific in the film and they should have him in noir films or he's not CGI to the monkey or something he's he's he's quite a good actor and I really enjoyed him in the film he plays I'm a crazy guy okay so we have to end so I analyzed it as a film very enjoyable very good movie okay now the politics so before I go any further I want to point something out I did not politicize this film you politicize this film media because you guys who made this into a big issue I'm gonna read you some of the headlines from the New York Times these are the headlines from the New York Times about this film in the last two weeks alone one Black Panther smashes box-office records in Hollywood myths I took seventh graders to see Black Panther here's what they said Black Panther and the revenge of black nerds how Black Panther got it's gorgeous Afrocentric era why Black Panther is a defining moment for black America Black Panther brings hope hype and pride hey people last week we're saying I was very upset that there is this movie being made no I'm not I don't care whether the movie is made it's a good movie I enjoyed it what I care about is that the media are treating this as some sort of glorious moment like this is a very very important cultural moment it's not a very important cultural moment I'm sorry it isn't there been blockbusters with black leads black comic book characters and films including Nick Fury hit movies primarily about black people for years critically acclaimed movies about black people for years in the last five years I think 12 years of slave and moonlight both won both about black people so the idea that the Americans are not willing to go see a movie with primarily black people like what are you talking about I just don't see the evidence for any of that and there's this this kind of virtue signaling that's now going around people saying they love the movie a little more than they do because they want to prove that they want to see a movie with black people in liked it I think that's really dumb the movies good is it is it Citizen Kane no it's not Citizen Kane is it a very good Marvel movie sure okay the politics didn't go beyond that though so it's not just it's important for black kids to see a black superhero which I find a dubious measure I don't think it's important for white kids to see a white superhero I think it's fine for white kids to see a black superhero like Black Panther I think it's fine for black kids to see a white superhero I don't care it makes no difference to me but there's something beyond that so Carvel Wallace wrote this in the in the New York Times quote no one knows colonization better than the car and black folks wasted no time in recolonizing Wakanda no genocide or takeover of land was required what Kansai is ours now we do with it as we please and then he said also in this article that there's a video posted to Twitter in December which has since gone viral three young men seen fawning over the Black Panther Post heard a movie theater one jokingly embraces the poster well another asks rhetorically this is what white people get to feel like all the time there's laughter before someone says is those delivering the punchline to the most painful joke ever told I would love this country to accept nobody's ever gone to see a Captain America movie and said wow look a movie with a white hero I'm so excited he's white nobody does that in America that's not a thing and they certainly don't go to a movie and say wow look a movie with all white people and all the black people are bad because that would be a racist movie that would be Birth of a Nation that's bad I took no this is not okay so what are the politics that are actually the movie I didn't politicize it you pull it aside sister now I have to break down the politics sorry I have to do that shouldn't ruin your experience in the film it's a good film okay so here's what's good Martin Luther King defeats Malcolm X so there are two main characters in the film one is two Chawla who is a stolid Chadwick Boseman and one in he's sort of plays the MLK figure he's taking over from Wakanda so I have to explain the plot of the film so spoilers ahead okay if you don't want to hear the spoilers tune out now here are the spoilers so there's a fictional Kingdom it does not exist because the entire none of this exists right it's Marvel Universe but we're gonna pretend that it does exist for purposes of this conversation because when you analyze the politics of a film and the messages that are being promoted by the film you have to take it on its own terms so here is the so here's what's going on there is a country called Wakanda what Konza was hit with a meteorite that is filled with vibranium vibranium is basically unobtainium it is the greatest metal that has ever been created it can heal spinal wounds it can give you visions of your forefathers it can do anything vibranium it's just unbelievably cool crap and it can turn your entire civilization apparently so long as there are no white people in your civilization it can turn your entire civilization into a fully westernized fully liberal place with gay rights and women running the military and women running all the science weren't running all the science institutions and all this Auto Tech cultural influences don't matter all that matters in this universe is that a big meteorite landed right here and that there were no white people to ruin it that was pretty much the premise of Wakanda and then what kind of hides from everybody but they still have the greatest country ever without any trade they have this metal but the metal magically can grow things and it can it can make everything super cool it can be isolationist you can have a complete complete state with no outside interference at all now pause in real life this doesn't work out for anyone Japan was the closest thing to this America basically opened Japan with a couple of gunboats hey China was like this in the 1860s the United States sent a couple of gunboats into China during the Boxer Rebellion and basically took over the earth during the opium wars and basically took over large swaths of China and opened it to trade so this is not accurate okay when you cut yourself off from the outside world it typically makes you weaker not stronger but put that aside hey so what Conda is fantastic it's the greatest place ever but what kind that didn't help out black people around the world when black people were suffering at the hands of white people so the king of Wakanda before it's a travel was to Chaka it's his dad to Chaka had a brother his brother was sent as a spy to Oakland why would you send a spy to Oakland no one knows okay know what's in Oakland were you trying to get the Raiders playbook there's nothing going on in Oakland that needs spying on innocent a spy he spit him to Washington DC right to the Russians spend time sending their spies to help Trump in Oakland no okay so that's stupid but they send they sent him to Oakland he sent his brother to Oakland and his brother in Oakland then turns into basically like a black panther like an actual militant guy who says that America he gives a whole speech about how America is filled with discrimination and how black people in America are essentially living in poverty because the white people have flooded their neighborhoods with drugs and over-policing there's an actual black lives matter speech in the middle of the film okay the the then he tries to smuggle some vibranium out to all of these Black Panthers type groups and to chop guy has to kill him so to track that kills brother the brother had a son the brother son is Michael B Jordan who grows up to be kill monger his entire agenda is what kinda has all of this awesome vibranium why don't we help out oppress people's around the world overthrow their colonialist masters okay that's the premise of the film and that's the conflict - ciao - ciao low winds and kill mongrel losses so MLK defeats defeats commander that's good right em okay is program is better than Malcolm X's program militants and separatism is not better than integration and and the belief that life should get better for everybody however the film's real message is that kill monger is right and that's that it's impossible to watch the film and not feel some they foretell maunder because of the way the script is written there that's for a couple of reasons one Lacan is incredible in this film the United States is garbage for black people terrible place to live for black people now again break2 real-life America is the best place on earth for black people there is no better place on planet Earth for black people as a group of human beings just like there is no better place for women or jews or anyplace else on planet earth for anyone than the United States just a fact Hey measure it in terms of income measure it in terms of lifestyle however you want to do it America is a fantastic place for black people that does not justify colonialism it does not justify slavery evil things are evil but that is not the same thing as saying that black people in the United States right now are somehow under the boot of the white supremacist institution which is which is sort of the premise of the film so the United States and the film's garbage and Wakanda is great that being the case kill mongers actually right he's suggesting that black people in the United States are oppressed and that the system in the United States is legitimate because of colonialism and slavery and therefore you have to overthrow that with violence that seems like not the worst logic and that doesn't seem completely wrong now the reason it's wrong in real life is because colonization can be wrong and unjustifiable and so can slavery but the suggestion that the province of modern-day Africa lie and colonization and slavery as opposed to a lot of internal problems that have existed for centuries in many places around the world including in Africa and that those problems continue today that's too simplistic okay that's too simplistic to blame that on colonization and slavery because that's that's silly okay that's it so that's that's but the message is the the wrong message here which the kill monger is basically correct there are a couple of minds in here that underscore this one of the people in the film who sort of the the cue figure isn't James Bond cue one of the people in the film is a is the sister of T'Challa and for no reason at all just calls a white boy white guy white boy she calls the she calls Bilbo Baggins white boy for no reason and then she also says she calls him colonizer like literally for no reason he walks out of bed and she goes don't don't surprise me like that colonizer it's like really yeah you just drop that in the middle of a film and it's totally cool cuz all white people are colonizers now by the way the united states the least colonizing power in the history of great powers okay so that some of the stuff that I just like there's also some rips against the US military the solution at the end of the film is apparently not militants but spending lots of money in the interstate it's a chili decides that he's gonna that he's gonna buy up the portion of Oakland where his where his cousin grew up and and he's gonna spend a lot of money on stem technologies or somesuch we've tried that it has not been a giant success the problem inside a lot of communities failing communities in the United States white black and green is lack of fathers crime rates that are too high lack of social institutions not lack of monetary investment we spent lots of money on the war on poverty it has not been particularly effective there's some mixed messaging on walls we learned that walls are bad there's what they actually one of the characters actually say I think it's Charlie says we don't need to build walls we need to build bridges except for the fact that the entire what Kahn's in Empire is built because of a wall and that two of the four people who are in Wakanda have tried to destroy what Conda so that's not a really great immigration program apparently but not every listen not everything is all the messages are bad it says that women can be great at science which is fine it says that what it's good I mean great it says that race is not an obstacles to success which is true and good I hope people take away the good messages and not the bad but there's the full breakdown of that you know we're gonna we're out of time here so we're gonna have to do our federalist paper tomorrow so we'll save our federalist paper for tomorrow we do that every week but you'll just have to come back here tomorrow for that i'm ben
