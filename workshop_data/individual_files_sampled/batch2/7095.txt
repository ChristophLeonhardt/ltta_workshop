young turks now has audio the TYT audio network podcasts of some of your favorite shows and new shows including one with Nina Turner former Ohio State Senator she's gonna do we the people with Nina Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio we all know that Trump does it like leakers he doesn't like the leaking and he said that he's gonna do something about it well it looks like we've entered a new phase of that with the Justice Department cracking down on a suspected leaker a former aide to the Senate Intelligence Committee was arrested for allegedly lying to the FBI about communications with a New York Times reporter that is as this graphic saying James a wolf charged with lying repeatedly to investigators about his contacts with three separate reporters according to the authorities mr. wolf made false statements to the FBI about providing two of them with sensitive information related to the committee's work he denied to investigators that he ever gave classified material to journalists the seizure was disclosed in a letter to The Times reporter ally Watkins who had been in a three-year relationship with mr. wolf and we have some more details about how exactly this relationship between wolf and these journalists went down court documents describe mr. wolf's communications with actually four reporters including miss Watkins using encrypted messaging applications that either aren't as encrypted as we thought they were or he wasn't using them properly it appeared that the FBI was investigating how mrs. Watkins learned that Russian spies in 2013 had tried to recruit Carter Paige former trump foreign policy advisor she published an article for BuzzFeed news about that about the attempted recruitment mr. Page in which she confirmed the contacts FBI agents initially approached miss Watkins about the relationship she had with mr. wolf saying they were investigating unauthorized leaks the Justice Department told her in a letter sent in February that her records had been seized but that is the the the relationship that we have the most details about but it was not the only one in another case the indictment said mr. wolf used an encrypted messaging app to alert another reporter in October 2017 that he had served mr. Paige with a subpoena to testify before the committee and that same month mr. wolf reached out to a third reporter on the same unidentified app to offer to serve as an unnamed source according to documents so there's still more for us to learn about this we'll have a little bit more later on but understand that they apparently several months ago seized all these communications from The Times reporter which is not necessarily unprecedented in recent history coming out of the White House but it is a ramping up of this war against leaking war against whistleblowers that President Obama started I mean President Obama was way more aggressive against whistleblowers than then Bush ever was it was one of the most disappointing aspects of President Obama's tenure as president and now according to the New York Times Jeff Sessions and and the Justice Department under Donald Trump are doing three times as many as Obama was at the end of his term so this is a bipartisan war on whistleblowers and they're an easy target because they had this weird relationship I guess a relationship between the journalist and the leaker so it makes it easier for Jeff Sessions to go after them it's not you know it's not Edward Snowden it's not Chelsea Manning this isn't a case that involves major major policy implications but it is indicative of a larger trend that I think is bipartisan and a little bit troubling to me yeah yesterday we were talking about how ice officials have contracted with a company to do widespread surveillance in the United States you know in an effort to catch undocumented immigrants but it gives them a lot of your just a broad broad power and when we're talking about that story I made the the argument and the same argument applies here that when you're a Democrat who got elected as president and you lay the groundwork or you expand your powers to do this type of stuff to do this type of behavior well then who's to say the person who gets elected after you who might actually be a terrible person wouldn't you know use that to his advantage and expand it even further and that's that's what we're gonna get with the Trump administration of course they're gonna go after whistleblowers and leakers aggressively especially in this administration where there has been at least one leak a day in regard to what the administration is doing behind the scenes right it's also it's it's it's it's it's a war with the press I mean it's it's a war with reporters and it's a world with whistleblowers and it is something that obviously they're very comfortable doing and I think the fact that you know they've only started and they're already like well beyond the sort of amounts of the Obama administration is very telling for what's going to happen going forward it's where there's a retaining of sort of power to restrict effectively the First Amendment yeah yeah I would I guess in a very real sense I would consider us lucky that they haven't done more sense considering how many times he promised during the campaign do uh was it to tighten the libel laws and all of that and his obviously lifelong hatred for the media at least the media that's not currently talking to him and about him in the way that he wants but the the depressing thing is the particular type of leak that we had here so it had to do with Carter page which means that this person was leaking to provide information about some of the nefarious elements of Donald Trump's campaign which means that we can be sure that the right wing is not going to say a peep about this and they're not gonna care about it because they don't want those leaks to happen and it scares me that our country so much of the media and those who comment on these sort of things have broken up into two groups where it's either you will report in it only if it's Donald Trump and you won't mention that up until like the early part of his second term Obama had done some things like this he didn't do it in the later part of a second term but he still did do it at one point we acknowledge that some people will only talk about Donald Trump's offense and not acknowledge the historical precedent for it and some will only mention this as a route to do it what about Obama things that's such and that's insane we have to acknowledge both we have to be both accountable I think you're so right and I remember you know the treatment toward Edward Snowden or the treatment toward Chelsea Manning under Obama's watch was hideous and it was something that we talked about on a regular basis and it's this is not a partisan issue if you genuinely care about the Constitution and the First Amendment then you can't be disingenuous and and you know be one-sided in your coverage or in your outrage about it right so if you're outraged under the Obama administration you should be as equally outraged right now considering what the Trump administration is doing because really this is not a partisan issue this is not about Democrat Republican conservative versus liberal or progressive this is all about making sure that journalists are able to do their jobs and those who provide journalists with information that we should know about are protected yeah and it's disturbing that other journalists aren't focusing on this enough they didn't focus on an enough man under President Obama because he was charismatic and by all accounts in his individual personal life a really good guy and he had a decent relationship with the Washington press corps but now because it's Trump and it's an ugly face on it and he is vulgar and gross now more people are discussing it but again it's not being discussed enough journalists should be protecting other journalists at all costs all the time that's right and the fact that this story came out but hasn't had that attention that it should get from from all from all of the media field is really scary it is scary because I just feel like we're inching closer and closer to a society where people are gonna be afraid to speak out the whole point by the way the assault on journalists during the Trump administration so far has been pretty transparent I mean he's talked about taking credentials away from people who criticize him or write about him in a critical way and by the way we're talking about establishment media outlets like The Washington Post and The New York Times they don't go out of their way at least traditionally to tear politicians apart usually they try to be as friendly as possible because they want access to that person I mean if we start tearing down news organizations like that imagine what would happen to independent news organizations who actually do very aggressively criticize someone like Trump yeah yeah my worry is that that this will be talked about but it'll be talked about amongst Trump space and they'll love it because the thing is like like Obama making the moves that he did is scary because of the expansion of executive power but it didn't rest on a foundation of the media is fake news isn't real there is no truth that's the world that we're living right now where Infowars the more credible news source than the Washington Post and that's what almost everyone in government seems to believe and I don't know again I think that we're lucky that we've gotten as far right now without him cracking down more on the and I wonder what will there be left by the time his second term ends if it comes to that two easy ways for the Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down
