1
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:04,070
 WHEN YOU

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,837
ARE TRYING TO CREATE SOMETHING

3
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:05,171
NEW?

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,472
>> IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO

5
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:07,540
ENVISION THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY

6
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,809
THAN IT IS TODAY.

7
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,345
YOU HAVE THIS FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE

8
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,614
OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A

9
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,683
HALLUCINATION AND A VISION IS

10
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,450
THE OTHER PEOPLE CAN SEE THE

11
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,654
VISION.

12
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:22,488
YOU FIND YOURSELF OUT THERE WITH

13
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:25,025
THE HALLUCINATION.

14
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:25,858
YOU GET A CHANCE WITH A CLEAN

15
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:26,859
SHEET OF A VIRTUE IMAGINE THE

16
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:29,896
WORLD IN A DIFFERENT STATE.

17
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:34,234
WHAT A LOT OF THE GREAT ROUNDERS

18
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:34,968
HAVE IN COMMON IS THEY HAVE

19
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:35,835
DEVELOPED WHAT THE WORLD TO BE

20
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:39,339
LIKE AND I GET SO INTENSE ABOUT

21
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,206
THAT THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY

22
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,975
EVERYBODY DOESN'T GET IT.

23
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:45,078
THEY DEVELOP A VIEW OF WHAT THE

24
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:45,878
WORLD SHOULD BE LIKE AND IF THEY

25
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,880
SEE IT, THEY SEE IT

26
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,250
COMPREHENSIVELY.

27
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,117
THE GOOD ONES BUILD UP A BATTLE

28
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,052
PLAN TO BE ABLE TO BUILD A

29
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,955
COMPANY AROUND THAT IDEA AND

30
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,024
THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF THE

31
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,692
VALLEY HASN'T CHANGED.

32
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:03,997
WHAT'S THE GREAT EXECUTIVES AND

33
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:04,697
ENGINEERS AND BE ABLE TO

34
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:05,331
CATALYZE SOMETHING.

35
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:09,702
IT IS ALMOST NEVER ONE PERSON

36
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:10,470
AND IT'S ALMOST NEVER THE

37
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:10,903
FOUNDERS.

38
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:14,474
IT'S THE FIRST 20 PEOPLE AND

39
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,275
THEN THE FIRST THOUSAND PEOPLE

40
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:15,742
WHO BUILT IT.

41
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,243
THE TEAM EITHER GELS OR IT

42
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,580
DOESN'T.

43
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,447
BUT WHEN IT DOES, MAGICAL THINGS

44
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:23,216
HAPPEN.

45
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,419
EMILY: TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED OR

46
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:26,886
MEDICALLY.

47
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:27,820
HAVE YOU MATURED AND CHANGED

48
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:34,560
WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR APPROACH?

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,496
MARK: I THINK THE LEVEL OF

50
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,730
EFFORT REQUIRED TO KEEP AN OPEN

51
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,498
MIND EPES GETTING HIGHER AND

52
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,300
HIGHER.

53
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,438
THERE IS THIS THING CALLED THE

54
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,308
EVENT HORIZON.

55
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,643
THAT'S THE POINT OF A BLACK HOLE

56
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,477
WHERE YOU CAN'T GET OUT AGAIN

57
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:55,882
FOR TOP WE ALL HAVE A PERSONAL

58
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:56,582
EVENT HORIZON AND BECOME

59
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:57,383
REACTIONARY AND REACH A POINT

60
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,851
WHERE IT'S LIKE YOU HAD ME WITH

61
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:02,388
THE PC, I GOT THE SMARTPHONE, I

62
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,924
GOT THE ICE OWN, I GOT A'S BOOK,

63
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,460
BUT THE SNAP CHAT THING IS JUST

64
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,363
TOO FAR.

65
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,632
I DON'T GET IT COME I DON'T

66
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,800
UNDERSTAND IT AND THOSE CRAZY

67
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,634
KIDS AND IT'S STUPID AND WHAT

68
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,636
ARE PEOPLE THINKING?

69
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,503
SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS

70
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:22,575
NEW.

71
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,345
AND, BY THE WAY, ALL OF US --

72
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,513
THIS IS A VERY OPEN CONVERSATION

73
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:32,485
BECAUSE WE ALL DO IT.

74
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,588
YOU CAN SEE IT AND YOU CAN SEE

75
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,457
IT IN THE BODY LANGUAGE.

76
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:43,630
IT'S LIKE YOU ARE GOING DOWN.

77
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,799
YOU HAVE TO FORCE YOURSELF.

78
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,535
YOU HAVE TO METHODICALLY FORCE

79
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,503
YOURSELF NOT TO CLOSE DOWN AND

80
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,540
IT IS SO HARD, ESPECIALLY HARD

81
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,675
WHEN YOU THINK VCS DON'T HAVE

82
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,610
THESE PROBLEMS.

83
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,650
BUT THE THING IS, WE FUND ONE IN

84
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,451
100 OF THE NEW IDEAS THAT WE SEE

85
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,519
THAT ARE LEGITIMATE QUALIFIED

86
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,389
THINGS WILL STOP 99 OUT OF 100

87
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,660
TIMES, WE SAY NO.

88
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,129
THE LEVEL OF CYNICISM YOU CAN

89
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:16,963
BUILD UP WHEN YOU SAY NO ALL THE

90
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:20,633
TIME CREATES A MENTAL FOG OF

91
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:24,670
NEGATIVITY AND WHEN ONE DOES

92
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,072
WALK IN, YOU HAVE TO SAY OK,

93
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:26,806
THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE

94
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:31,310
THING.

95
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,180
AND THEY COME OUT OF LEFT FIELD.

96
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,981
EVERYONE AFTER-THE-FACT NEW

97
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,449
AIRBNB WAS GOING TO BE HUGE, BUT

98
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,919
AT THE TIME, FOR EVERY BIG

99
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,522
THING, MANY EXPERTS ARE ON

100
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,626
RECORD SAYING THAT STUPID, SO

101
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,393
YOU ARE CONSTANTLY UP AGAINST

102
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,129
THIS WALL AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP

103
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,433
TRYING TO PUNCH THROUGH IT.

104
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,233
EMILY: YOU SCALED UP THE FIRM.

105
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,936
HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN THE WALLY

106
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,138
BARR OF YOUR INVESTMENT?

107
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,174
MARK: ONE IS ABSOLUTE -- YOU

108
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,076
SPEND ALL DAY LONG TRYING TO

109
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,111
WORK INTERNALLY WITH THE FIRM

110
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,915
AND THE FOUNDERS TRYING TO BACK

111
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,250
THE HIGHEST QUALITY TEAMS THAT

112
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,588
YOU CAN GET BETTER.

113
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,456
PROBABLY THE THING THAT HELPS IS

114
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,255
YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON A RELATIVE

115
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:20,560
BASIS.

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,594
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES YOU HAVE

117
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,361
IS YOU GET TO SEE MANY TEAMS

118
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,865
GOING AFTER THE SAME THING AND

119
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:26,566
YOU GET TO DO THIS CROSS

120
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,035
COMPARISON AND WORLD CLASS IS

121
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,937
ALMOST NEVER EVERYTHING IN ONE

122
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,374
COMPANY.

123
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,776
THIS COMPANY IS GREAT AT SALES,

124
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,477
THIS COMPANY IS GREAT AT

125
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,177
MARKETING AND THEN YOU SPEND

126
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,912
TIME CONVINCING EACH OF THEM

127
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:43,216
THEY CAN LEARN FROM THE OTHERS.

128
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,551
AND THERE IS A THING WHERE THE

129
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,285
STRONGEST FOUNDERS ARE LEAST

130
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:49,589
INTERESTED IN INPUT, SO WHEN YOU

131
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,389
TELL THEM YOU ARE TERRIBLE AT

132
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:51,190
MARKETING AND THERE'S ANOTHER

133
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,192
COMPANY YOU SHOULD LEARN FROM

134
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:53,960
AND THEN THEY SAY THAT OTHER

135
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,164
COMPANIES. X SUCK AND YOU SAY

136
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,398
YES, THAT'S WHY THEY ARE GOOD AT

137
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:01,434
MARKETING.

138
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,302
IT IS JUST CAJOLING PEOPLE INTO

139
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,437
LEARNING.

140
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,707
THE ROLE MODELS ARE THERE.

141
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,508
THIS INDUSTRY HAS A HUGE NUMBER

142
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,879
OF SPECTACULAR PEOPLE.

143
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,746
YOU GET VERY SPREAD OUT BUT THEY

144
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,649
ARE OUT THERE AND YOU CAN LEARN

145
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,250
FROM WHAT THEY DO.

146
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,254
EMILY: WHAT ARE SOME INVESTORS

147
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,722
YOU HAVE MADE THAT WILL PROVE

148
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:27,226
OTHER VCS WRONG?

149
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,127
MARK: SILENT AS THE ONE I CAN'T

150
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:33,132
STOP TALKING ABOUT STOP EMILY:

151
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:33,933
WE HAVE THEM REPRESENTED AT OUR

152
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:34,700
EVENING EVENT AND THERE WAS SOME

153
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,969
GET THIS IS HIM.

154
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,438
MARK: SILENT DRIVES PEOPLE

155
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:39,839
CRAZY.

156
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,643
YOU CAN GET UPSET ABOUT THEM --

157
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,278
IT'S LIKE THE RORSCHACH TECH --

158
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,045
RORSCHACH TEST FOR GETTING

159
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,914
UPSET.

160
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:53,819
YOU CAN SAY WHY DOES IT HAVE

161
00:05:53,819 --> 00:06:00,026
DIFFERENT FLAVORS, WHY OR LIKE

162
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,826
THE NEW YORK TIMES DID, YOU CAN

163
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:04,997
ASK THE SOMALIA AT THE FRENCH

164
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,833
RESTAURANT -- IT WAS A BARELY A

165
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:12,071
HARD ONE TO PREDICT.

166
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,675
IS YOU COME FACE TO FACE AND

167
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,977
HAVE EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM,

168
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:18,811
IT'S AN AMAZING AND MAGICAL

169
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,746
THING AND THE SCOPE AND VISION

170
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:23,082
IS GIGANTIC.

171
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:26,252
IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL TECHNOLOGY

172
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,988
COMPANY DOING FUNDAMENTAL WORK,

173
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,224
SO THAT'S REALLY FUN.

174
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,992
EMILY: WHEN IT COMES TO AI, VR,

175
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:36,762
DRONES, WHICH SECTOR IS THE MOST

176
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:39,999
POTENTIAL FOR TRULY DISRUPTIVE

177
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,502
INNOVATION?

178
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,302
MARK: THE TWO THAT ARE MOVING

179
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,338
THE FASTEST WITH THE SURE

180
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:51,310
VELOCITY ARE A ALIVE AND BIOTECH

181
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,644
.

182
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,478
THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING AT THE

183
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,414
INTERSECTION OF AI AND BIOTECH.

184
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,115
THERE'S JUST BEEN A FUNDAMENTAL

185
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,116
TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH IN

186
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:01,120
THE LAST YEARS WITH DEEP

187
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,388
LEARNING AND THE RISE OF

188
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:06,258
SUPERFAST, SUPER CHEAP SHIPS AND

189
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:07,427
THESE DATA SETS.

190
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,731
PRODUCTS ARE BECOMING POSSIBLE

191
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,531
THAT WERE JUST NOT POSSIBLE FIVE

192
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:14,567
YEARS AGO.

193
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,503
THE SCIENCE THERE IS MOVING VERY

194
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,705
FAST AND THERE IS THIS

195
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,606
INCREDIBLE FEEDBACK LOOP BETWEEN

196
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:26,479
THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND ITS

197
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,246
MOVING INCREDIBLY FAST AND IS

198
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:31,684
VERY EXCITING STOP THE OTHER IS

199
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,518
BIOTECH, IT'S LESS A SINGLE

200
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:32,885
THING.

201
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:37,923
IT'S MORE A RESULT OF THE

202
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:38,658
CONVERGENCE OF BIOLOGICAL

203
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,059
SCIENCE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE.

204
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:40,893
THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPING FOR A

205
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,728
DECADE BUT IS REALLY STARTING TO

206
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,830
PAY OFF NOW.

207
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,197
YOU HAVE A NEW GENERATION OF

208
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:51,003
NEWLY MINTED PHD GRADUATES WHO

209
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:51,804
ARE ALSO COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AND

210
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,839
YOU HAVE NEW SCIENCES LIKE

211
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,875
GENOMICS AND THE STUDIES OF THE

212
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,910
BIOME AND ALL OF THESE BIG DATA

213
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,546
SETS YOU ARE ABLE TO GATHER.

214
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,249
THE INTERSECTION OF GIANT -- OF

215
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,116
BIOLOGY AND COMPUTER SCIENCE IS

216
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,987
A MAGICAL PLACE.

217
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:14,794
WE HAVE THIS BIO 2.0 FUND AND

218
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,095
ALL OF OUR FIRST FOUR

219
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:20,232
INVESTMENTS HAVE DEEP LEARNING

220
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:21,033
AND AI AT THE CORE OF WHAT THEY

221
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,201
DO AND IT'S ALL COMING TOGETHER

222
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,135
AT THE SAME TIME.

223
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,571
EMILY: HOW IS APPLE DOING ON AI

224
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,008
WITH RESPECT TO AMAZON AND

225
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,209
GOOGLE.

226
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,945
MARK: I HAVE TO TAKE FACEBOOK

227
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,181
OFF THE TABLE.

228
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,883
BUT I THINK IT IS CLEAR THAT OF

229
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:39,818
THE BIG COMPANIES, AMAZON HAS

230
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:42,154
LAPPED EVERYBODY AT LEAST THIS

231
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,957
YEAR AND THIS ACT OF AND ALEXA

232
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,194
ARE FUNDAMENTAL BREAKTHROUGHS.

233
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,830
IT IS FAIRLY SHOCKING EVEN FOR

234
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,331
PEOPLE IN THE FIELD HOW WELL

235
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,566
THEY ARE DOING AND THE CONSUMER

236
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,366
RESPONSE TO GO FROM PEOPLE WHO

237
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:57,103
ARE NOT US IS REALLY

238
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,673
SPECTACULAR.

239
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,541
I THINK AMAZON HAS SET A NEW

240
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,374
BENCHMARK FOR WHAT IT MEANS TO

241
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:08,647
HAVE AN INNER ACTIVE AI STOP THE

242
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:09,515
OTHER BIG COMPANIES REALIZE THAT

243
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,382
IN THERE'S GOING TO BE A CERTAIN

244
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,083
AMOUNT OF CATCH UP HAPPENING

245
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:15,488
STOP THE BIG THING IN THE AI

246
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,288
WORLD PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT

247
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,357
IS OF THE BIG COMPANIES, APPLE

248
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,693
IS THE ONE WHO HAS DECLARED THIS

249
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:21,494
IDEOLOGICAL DECISION OF NOT

250
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:25,431
COLLECTING CENTRALIZED DATA, SO

251
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,198
THE OTHER BIG COMPANIES ARE

252
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,301
BUILDING THESE GIANT DATABASES

253
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:30,570
AND APPLE HAS DECLARED THEY

254
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,039
WON'T DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE

255
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,874
THIS PRIVACY POSITION THEY HAVE

256
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:35,207
TAKEN.

257
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,676
THEY HAVE THIS NEW APPROACH THAT

258
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:38,477
THEY TALKED ABOUT THIS WEEK AND

259
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:42,848
IT LOOKS PROMISING, BUT THE

260
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:43,682
QUESTION THE INDUSTRY'S WILL

261
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:45,317
THAT BE ENOUGH TO KEEP UP WITH

262
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:46,485
THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT GOOGLE

263
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,688
OR AMAZON IS MAKING WITH THE

264
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:53,059
LEVEL OF DATA ACCESS THEY HAVE.

265
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:53,993
AMONG THE GUERRILLAS, THAT'S THE

266
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:59,064
BIG QUESTION.

267
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:01,801
ONE OF THE REASONS I'M EXCITED

268
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,601
ABOUT IS IF YOU HAD ASKED ME A

269
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,870
YEAR AGO IS AI GOING TO BE

270
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,604
SOMETHING BIG COMPANIES ARE

271
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:06,739
STARTUPS DO, I WOULD PROBABLY

272
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,810
SAY BIG COMPANIES BECAUSE THEIR

273
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,644
VIEW WAS THERE WAS ONLY A SMALL

274
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,845
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND

275
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:13,946
AI SYSTEMS AND THEN YOU NEED

276
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,682
THESE GIANT DATA SETS THAT ONLY

277
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,484
THE BIG COMPANIES HAVE ACCESS

278
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,052
TO.

279
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,587
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST

280
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,722
SIX MONTHS IS A LUNCH OF NEW

281
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:27,960
STARTUPS WHERE IT IS ONE WHERE

282
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,727
TWO OR THREE EXPERTS, MANY OF

283
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:29,662
WHOM ARE COMING OUT OF THE BIG

284
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,131
COMPANIES AND MAY HAVE EITHER

285
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:32,932
FIGURED OUT A WAY TO GET ACCESS

286
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,967
TO DATA OR FIGURED OUT A WAY TO

287
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:43,408
DO ADVANCED AI ON THE DATA SETS.

288
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:45,511
EMILY: YOU MENTION THERE'S GOING

289
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,445
TO BE A LOT MORE AND A DAY.

290
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,279
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING COMPANIES

291
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,651
ACED ON THE OVERALL ENVIRONMENT?

292
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,453
THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT YOU

293
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,254
ARE COUNSELING COMPANIES NOT TO

294
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,424
GO PUBLIC STOP MARK: IT'S HARDER

295
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,191
TO BE A PUBLIC COMPANY TODAY

296
00:10:59,191 --> 00:10:59,758
THAN IT USED TO BE.

297
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:02,328
I HAVE TALKED AT LENGTH ABOUT

298
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:11,603
THIS.

299
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:13,505
IT'S HARDER TO BE PUBLIC AND IT

300
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:15,908
IS HARDER TO GO PUBLIC AND

301
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,110
OBSERVATIONALLY, THERE'S A LOT

302
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,414
MORE THAN THERE USED TO BE.

303
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:25,117
ON THE OTHER HAND, WE BELIEVE

304
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:25,918
THE PENDULUM HAS PROBABLY SWUNG

305
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,386
TOO FAR IN AGAINST GOING PUBLIC

306
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,422
AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AND SO

307
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:36,095
WE'VE CREATED A TEAM IN OUR FIRM

308
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:36,896
FOCUSED ON IPO PREPAREDNESS.

309
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,365
WHAT IS THE PROCESS TO GET READY

310
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,367
TO GO PUBLIC?

311
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,504
WHAT IS REQUIRED TO GO PUBLIC?

312
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:49,742
IT'S BUILDING A BOARD OF

313
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,610
DIRECTORS, YOUR EXECUTIVE TEAM

314
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,444
AND ALL THESE THINGS YOU HAVE TO

315
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:57,683
DO TO GO PUBLIC WILL STOP EMILY:

316
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:58,484
YOU ARE COUNSELING THEM ON IPO

317
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,020
READINESS?

318
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,754
MARK: THEN THEY HAVE THE

319
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,789
DECISION.

320
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,792
IF YOU GET READY TO GO PUBLIC,

321
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,394
IT BECOMES AN OBVIOUS THING IF

322
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,963
YOU WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

323
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,732
IT.

324
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,734
BUT THE COMPANIES THAT DO THIS

325
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,535
AND TAKE IT SERIOUSLY BECOME

326
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,603
BETTER EVEN IF THEY DON'T GO

327
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,338
PUBLIC AND BECOME BETTER AS

328
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,841
STAND-ALONE BUSINESSES AND

329
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:23,542
BECOME MORE ATTRACTIVE AS

330
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,910
ACQUISITIONS.

331
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,114
THAT'S A PROCESS OF MATURATION A

332
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:29,815
LOT OF COMPANIES ARE GOING

333
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:30,916
THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

334
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,953
AND -- 

335
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,789
SCARLET: YOU ARE WATCHING

336
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:40,926
"WHAT'D YOU MISS?"

337
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,529
FOR EQUITY INVESTORS COME A BIG

338
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,330
DECISION IS COMING DOWN IN THE

339
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,333
NEXT HOUR.

340
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,267
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY HERE AT

341
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,036
STAKE.

342
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:54,340
HSB SAYS $30 BILLION OF INFLOWS

343
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,074
COULD COME IN.

344
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,177
JOE: CHINA HAS IN TRYING TO GET

345
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:11,823
EQUITIES INVOLVED IN THIS.

346
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:12,691
THERE IS A HUGE DECISION COMING

347
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:16,262
UP.

348
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:22,368
SCARLET: IT'S DOWN TO 154

349
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,135
BILLION, DOWN 84% FROM THE PEAK

350
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:23,635
OF LAST YEAR.

351
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:26,038
A GREAT BALL OF MONEY MOVING

352
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,275
FROM IRON ORE TO HOUSING.

353
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:33,412
JOE: I'M LOOKING AT A CHART THAT

354
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,213
LOOKS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO YOUR

355
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:38,384
CHART, BUT THIS IS A CHART OF

356
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,218
OUTSTANDING MARGIN DEBT AND YOU

357
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:39,918
CAN SEE HOW SIMILAR IT IS.

358
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:43,155
THAT SPEAKS TO THIS BIG BALL OF

359
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,358
MONEY IDEA AND TO HOW MUCH THIS

360
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,560
MARKET DEPENDS ON PEOPLE

361
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,361
LEVERAGING INTO AND SPECULATING

362
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,130
ON IT WILL STOP LAST WEEK, THERE

363
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,432
WAS THIS WEEK IN THE MARGIN DEBT

364
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:59,071
AND THAT HAS COME DOWN A LOT.

365
00:13:59,071 --> 00:13:59,905
THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO THEY DO

366
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:00,672
TODAY AND HOW MUCH MONEY DOES

367
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:03,275
THAT INSTANTLY BRING INTO THE

368
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:03,976
MARKET THANKS TO PASSIVE

369
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:04,777
INVESTORS FORCED TO TRACK THE

370
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,580
INDEX?

371
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,651
SCARLET: COMING UP, AMERICAN

372
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:13,419
CONSUMERS WENT ON A SHOPPING

373
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,954
SPREE WITH RETAIL SALES CLOSING

374
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:15,754
WITH THEIR BEST BACK-TO-BACK

375
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:16,956
GAIN SINCE 2014.

376
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:17,756
