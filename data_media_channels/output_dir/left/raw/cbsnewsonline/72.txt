ON THE EAST FRONT OF THE CAPITOL

31
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:07,634
IS REMINISCENT OF WHAT WE SAW IN

32
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,102
ARIZONA WHEN McCAIN'S BODY AND

33
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,704
HIS CASKET WAS REMOVED FROM THE

34
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,473

00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,240

BE TAKEN INTO THE ROTUNDA OF THE

CAPITOL BUILDING.

41
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,122
HE LOVED THE U.S. SENATE.

42
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,224
IT WAS PART OF WHAT HEALED HIM

43
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,324
AFTER HIS TWO FAILED BIDS FOR

44
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:32,691
THE PRESIDENCY.

45
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:40,500
IT WAS COMING BACK TO THE SENATE

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,200
THAT HE LOVED.

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,538
HE WILL LIE IN STATE AT THE U.S.

48
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,072

00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,907
>> THANK YOU, WE'RE ALSO JOINED

HOST OF FACE THE NATION.

52
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,414
MARGARET BRENNAN, NOW THE HOST

00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,549
OF FACE THE NATION IS ALSO IN

54
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:56,849
WASHINGTON.

55
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:02,589
I THINK ABOUT THE LEGACY OF JOHN

56
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,923
McCAIN THERE IN THE UNITED

57
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:04,423
STATES SENATE.

58
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:12,164
HE NEVER WANTED TO BE KNOWN AS

59
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:12,598
MR. CONGENIALITY.

60
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:14,701
>> EXACTLY.

61
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,602
NANCY CORDES IS EXACTLY RIGHT

62
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,003
WHEN SHE SAYS HE WAS THE MAN OF

63
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:24,577
THE SENATE BUT HE WAS A

64
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,780
DIFFERENT KIND OF MAN.

65
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,881
HE WANTED ALWAYS TO DO MORE.

66
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:32,252
AS A RESULT, HE USED TO LAUGH

67
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:32,585
ABOUT THAT.

68
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:38,191
HE USED TO SAY I WILL NEVER BE

69
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:38,825
ELECTED MISS CONGENIALITY.

70
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,994
HE DID LOVE THAT PLACE AND HAD

71
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,830
EPIC BATTLES THERE, BUT HE ALSO

72
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,132
HAD SOME GREAT FRIENDSHIPS.

73
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:49,302
YOU KNOW, WE SAW YESTERDAY IN

74
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,070
ARIZONA WHEN JOE BIDEN GOT UP

75
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,070
AND SPOKE AT HIS FUNERAL.

76
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,706
THEY WERE TOUGH CUSTOMERS WHEN

77
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,575
THEY GOT OUT ON THE SENATE FLOOR

78
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,476
FIGHTING THE VARIOUS BATTLES,

79
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,279
BUT THEY WOULD WALK OFF THE

80
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,712
FLOOR AND THEY WERE FRIENDS.

81
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:01,981
THAT FRIENDSHIP REMAINED.

82
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,550
IT WAS A KIND OF FRIENDSHIP THAT

83
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,853
WE USED TO SEE SO MUCH IN THE

84
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:12,725
SENATE AND IT IS ALL TOO RARE

85
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,261
TODAY.

86
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:15,394
.

87
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:19,599
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT

88
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,100
ATTENDED THE CEREMONIES.

89
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,136
>> THE VICE PRESIDENT WILL BE

90
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,372
ATTENDING THE TWO HAD SERVED IN

91
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:26,772
CONGRESS TOGETHER.

92
00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:28,374
THEY WORKED TOGETHER ON FISCAL

93
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,243
ISSUES IN 2005 OR SO, BUT

94
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,445
REALLY, MIKE PENCE, FILLING THE

95
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,247
VOID THAT WILL BE NOTICEABLE

96
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,381
GIVEN THAT THE SITTING

97
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:44,357
PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP, WILL

98
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:49,495
NOT BE PARTICIPANTING, THAT IS A

99
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,165
DELIBERATE CHOICE.

100
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,534
MIKE PENCE WENT AND VISITED WITH

101
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,969
SOME OF AMERICA'S VETERANS, THE

102
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:59,672
AMERICAN LEGION JUST YESTERDAY,

103
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,473

104
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,841
ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE TO

105
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,577
REMEMBER THE LIFE TIME OF SVEN

106
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,112
THAT JOHN McCAIN GAVE TO -- LIFE

107
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,815
TIME OF SERVICE THAT JOHN McCAIN

108
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,682
GAVE TO THIS COUNTRY.

109
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,382
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE RESPECTS

110
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:12,018
HIS SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY AND

111
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,053
HAS OFFERS ALL SORTS OF

112
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,088
RESOURCES TO THE FAMILY,

113
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,324
INCLUDING THE MILITARY HONOR

114
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,826
GUARDS AND THE PLANES THAT

115
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,028
BROUGHT THE SENATOR'S CASKET

116
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,130
FROM ARIZONA TO JOINT BASE

117
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,764
ANDREWS JUST YESTERDAY.

118
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,166
>> BOB, I WANT TO GET YOUR

119
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,534
THOUGHTS, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE

120
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,436
INSTITUTION THAT JOHN McCAIN

121
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,574
WANTED SO MUCH TO PROTECT.

122
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,441
HE WAS AN INSTITUTIONALIST.

123
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,242
HE BELIEVED IN IT.

124
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,310
HE THOUGHT SOME OF THE MEMBERS

125
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,579
FELL SHORT, IF YOU THINK OF SOME

126
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:44,983
OF THE SENATORS WHO HAVE BEEN ON

127
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:56,629
THAT CATAPHALS I THINK HE WILL

128
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,798
BE REMEMBERED AS ONE OF THE

129
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,399
GIANTS.

130
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:07,106
IN SOME WAYS, HE WAS THE

131
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,974
CONSCIOUS OF THE SENATE.

132
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:11,144
HE WANTED THEM TO ADDRESS

133
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:11,377
THINGS.

134
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,546
NOT MANY PEOPLE WANTED TO DO

135
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,780
CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.

136
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,750
HE AND RUSS FEINGOLD, THE

137
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,686
DEMOCRAT FROM WASHINGTON, WERE

138
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:27,427
ABLE TO, AFTER YEARS, TO FINALLY

139
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,627
GET THAT LEGISLATION PASSED.

140
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:29,962
MANY THINGS DON'T LAST FOREVER.

141
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:36,502
I WAS THINKING AWHILE AGO, WE

142
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:45,378
WERE THINKING ABOUT THIS.

143
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:49,615
32 PEOPLE WENT TO PRISON.

144
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,385
THIS WAS EVEN BEFORE SENATOR

145
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,886
McCAIN AND FEINGOLD HAD PASSED

146
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:54,186
THEIR THING.

147
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:56,055
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, 32 OF THEM

148
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:56,756
WENT TO JAIL.

149
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,126
NOW ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THOSE

150
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:03,663
PEOPLE WENT TO JAIL FOR ARE NOW

151
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,597
LEGAL.

152
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:08,634
>> BOB, WE SEE NOW, CINDY

153
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:12,372

THEY HAD 7 CHILDREN, SOME FROM

157
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,882
HIS FIRST WIFE, AND THAT IS HIS

158
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:24,250
SON, JACK.

HE IS NAMED JOHN SYDNEY McCAIN

HE IS 32 YEARS OLD, HE IS A

164
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,965
HELICOPTER PILOT, JUST RETURNED

213
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,821
HE LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE SENATOR,

214
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,588
HIS BROTHER, JOHN McCAIN.

215
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:16,796
>> LET'S PAUSE FOR A MOMENT NOW

216
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:27,807

219
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:39,719
BODY BEARERS.

220
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:48,160
THIS IS A SOLEMN DUTY.

221
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,235
>>> THAT SOUND YOU HEAR

222
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:03,502
.

223
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,771
>> THAT SOUND YOU HEAR IS

224
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,406
ACTUALLY RAIN FOLLOWING IN THE

225
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:07,806
NATION'S CAPITAL.

226
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:13,379
NOT A HEAVY RAIN.

227
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:37,103

NANCY?

231
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:44,577
>> Reporter: WELL, HOW

232
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,878
REMARKABLE, NORAH, THAT THE RAIN

233
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,246
IS COMING DOWN AS HIS CASKET IS

234
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,249
TAKEN OUT OF THE HEARSE AND AS

235
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,285
THEY BEGIN TO WALK IT INTO THE

236
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,221
CAPITOL ROTUNDA WHERE HE WILL

237
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,624
LIE IN STATE AND COME BACK TO

238
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,626
THIS BUILDING FOR ONE LAST TIME.

239
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,462
WE SAW 12 TO 15,000 PEOPLE COME

240
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,631
TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO McCAIN

241
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,566
AT THE ARIZONA STATE CAPITOL AND

242
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,035
THOUSANDS MORE ARE EXPECTED TO

243
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:10,770
COME HERE TODAY.

244
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,607
AT THE TOP OF HIS STEPS, HIS

245
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,208
SONS SALUTING AS THE CASKET

246
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,378
PREPARES TO MAKE THE JOURNEY UP

247
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:19,779
THE STEPS.

248
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,348
THE FAMILY IS GATHERED TO KEEP

249
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,451
DRY AS THE RAIN FALL GETS

250
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:25,784
HEAVIER HERE.

251
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:28,687
JOHN McCAIN WAS A UNIQUE

252
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,490
BIPARTISAN FIGURE IN THE SENATE,

253
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,893
BIPARTISAN BECAUSE HE DELIGHTED

254
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,895
AND INFURIATED BOTH PARTIES IN

255
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:36,595
EQUAL MEASURE.

256
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,764
TODAY, WHEN YOU HEAR FROM THE

257
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,466
SENATE'S MAJORITY LEADER MITCH

258
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:40,733
McCONNELL.

259
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,601
YOU'LL GET A FLAVOR OF THAT.

260
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,570
HE WAS SIDE BY SIDE WITH JOHN

261
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,873
McCAIN IN MANY BATTLES AND ON

262
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,642
THE OTHER SIDE, ON MANY MORE.

263
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,510
YOU KNOW, FOR McCONNELL AND

264
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,412
OTHERS IN THE SENATE, THINGS CAN

265
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,814
BE PRETTY ORCHESTRATED, PRETTY

266
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,615
SCRIPTED THESE DAYS.

267
00:11:56,615 --> 00:12:00,686
NOT A LOT OF SURPRISES.

268
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:01,754
THERE WERE ALWAYS SURPRISES FROM

269
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:02,488
JOHN McCAIN.

270
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,623
>> I'M GETTING THE CHILLS KIND

271
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,390
OF WATCHING THIS.

272
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,160
ALMOST STARTING TO TEAR UP

273
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,428
THINKING ABOUT THIS FINAL VISIT

274
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:19,104
BY THE SENATOR AND IT RAINING.

275
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:20,606
>> THE BODY BEARERS WHO

276
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,040
EXEMPLIFY.

277
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,641
LOOK HOW THEY ARE CARRYING OUT

278
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,008
THEIR DUTY.

279
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,412
YOU WOULD NOT KNOW IT IS RAINING

280
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,546
ON THEM.

281
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,082
IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY

282
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,283
DEMONSTRATION OF PRECISION AND

283
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,652
RESPECT, THROUGH THE PRECISION,

284
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:34,653
A MAINTENANCE OF NORMS AND

285
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:35,754
STANDARDS IN CARRYING OUT

286
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,089
SOMEBODY WHO HAS SERVED.

287
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,358
>> EACH OF THEM FROM A DIFFERENT

288
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:43,128
SERVICE OF OUR U.S. MILITARY AS

289
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:44,163
THE OFFICIAL PROCLAMATION THAT

290
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,831
ALLOWS JOHN McCAIN TO LIE IN

291
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:49,869
STATE SAYS THE NATION MOURNS THE

292
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,704
LOSS OF A GREAT AMERICAN

293
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:58,644
PATRIOT, A STATESMAN WHO PUT HIS

294
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,779
COUNTRY FIRST AND ENRICHED THIS.

295
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:07,152
>> THERE IS ALSO A SYMBOL OF

296
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,755
PATRIOTISM AS HIS BODY IS TAKEN

297
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,123
INTO THE CAPITOL WITH HIS FAMILY

298
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:11,623
WATCHING, STANDING BY.

299
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,826
I WANT TO READ PART OF THE

300
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,761
STATEMENT THAT HIS DAUGHTER

301
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,095
RELEASED AFTER HIS PASSING.

302
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:17,496
>> MEGHAN McCAIN.

303
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,697
>> MEGHAN McCAIN.

304
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,499
>> SHE SAID MY FATHER'S PASSING

305
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,668
COMES WITH SORROW AND GRIEF FOR

306
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,570
ME, MY MOTHER AND FOR MY

307
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,438
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

308
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,940
HE WAS A GREAT FIRE WHO BURNED

309
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,010
BRIGHT AND WE LIVED IN HIS LIGHT

310
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,678
AND WARMTH FOR SO VERY LONG.

311
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,282
WE KNOW HIS FLAME LIVES ON IN

312
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:36,715
EACH OF US.

313
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,651
POWERFUL WORDS ABOUT A FAMILY

314
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:44,089
MAN BOTH AT HOME AND AT WORK.

315
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:44,957
HIS COLLEAGUES SPOKE ABOUT HOW

316
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,359
HE REACHED ACROSS BOTH SIDES OF

317
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:51,664
THE AISLE AND IN PLANNING HIS

318
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,231
SERVICES, HE HAS DONE THAT.

319
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,166
THE PRESENTATION OF THE SENATE

320
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,535
WREATH WILL BE BY BOTH MAJORITY

MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER.

323
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:06,212
>> THERE WE SEE THE INSIDE OF

326
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:13,085
YOU CAN SEE THE WHITE HOUSE

TOMORROW.

336
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,348
>> SOME WERE AT THE CEREMONY

LAST NIGHT AND HAVE ALSO COME,

00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:51,557
AGAIN, TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS.

339
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,524
WE MENTIONED THE CATAFALQUE,

340
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:58,297
THIS PLATFORM CONSTRUCTED

341
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:58,963
HASTILY BACK IN 1865.

342
00:14:58,963 --> 00:14:59,397
INCREDIBLE HISTORY.

CASKETS OF MANY OF THE SUPREME

00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,890
>> Reporter: WELL, I'M JUST

354
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,659
THINKING HOW MANY TIMES THAT

355
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,761
JOHN McCAIN HAS GONE ACROSS THE

356
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,563
ROTUNDA, GOING FROM ONE PLACE TO

357
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:31,796
ANOTHER.

358
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:33,432
IT IS A ROTUNDA, THE SENATE IS

359
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,233
ON ONE SIDE AND THE HOUSE IS ON

360
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:38,437
THE OTHER, BUT YOU KNOW, JOHN

361
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,807
McCAIN WAS A FAMILIAR FIGURE IN

362
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,776
WHAT WE ALWAYS CALL THE

363
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,209
CORRIDORS OF POWER.

364
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,344

CLOSE.

369
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,549
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH

370
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:52,885

WALK UP AND ASK THEM A QUESTION.

375
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:01,627
McCAIN, SENATOR McCAIN, YOU

376
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,827
COULD ALWAYS FIND SENATOR

377
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:03,195
McCAIN.

378
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:06,865
HE ALWAYS HAD TIME TO TALK TO

379
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,234
YOU, AND HE USED TO LAUGH ABOUT

380
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:09,434
THIS.

381
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:11,403
I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR SO LONG, HE

382
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,372
ALWAYS SAID, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TWO

383
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:15,474
OLD GEEZERS IN THIS HALL WAY

384
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,210
FILLED WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

385
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,945
WERE 30 YEARS YOUNGER THAN WE

386
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,347
WERE, ALL OF THE OTHER

387
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:22,614
REPORTERS.

388
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:26,718
WE USED TO LAUGH ABOUT THAT A

389
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:27,352
LOT.

390
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:28,620
WE'RE ACTUALLY THE SAME AGE.

391
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,256
HE WAS SO MUCH FUN TO COVER.

392
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,860
YOU KNOW, HE WAS SUCH A NORMAL

393
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,561
HUMAN PERSON.

394
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,729
HE WOULD GET MAD.

395
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:40,299
HE WOULD USE BAD LANGUAGE

396
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:40,632
SOMETIMES.

397
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,567
HE LIKED JOKES.

398
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:43,902
HE LOVES TO RIB YOU.

399
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:50,476
HE WAS ALWAYS ASK ME IF I

400
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,679
INVESTIGATED LIVING IN ASSISTED

401
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,146
LIVING AT ONE POINT.

402
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,881
HE JUST BROUGHT A LITTLE

403
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:56,615
SOMETHING EXTRA.

404
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,619
>> YOU KNOW, YOU MENTIONED

405
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,489
THERE, BOB, THAT HE WAS THE

406
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,490
CONSCIENCE OF THE SENATE.

407
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,657
HE BECAME THE CONSCIENCE OF THE,

408
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:07,826
SORT OF, GLOBAL ORDER.

409
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:08,660
AS SOMEONE WHO COVERED NATIONAL

410
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,896
SECURITY, JOHN McCAIN WAS

411
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:11,997
SOMEONE WHO ALWAYS STOOD UP

412
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:12,630
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

413
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,965
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO

414
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:17,002
SAY WHETHER IT WAS LEAD FROM

415
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,171
BEHIND OR AMERICA FIRST, THIS

416
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,571
WAS NOT THE WAY THAT THINGS

417
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:21,973
NEEDED TO BE.

418
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:29,314
ON ONE OF THE LAST TRIPS ABROAD

419
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,418
WENT TO MUNICH AND STARED DOWN

420
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,488
PUTIN AND SAID I'LL BE HERE TO

421
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:36,988
SUPPORT VALUES.

422
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:40,058
WE'LL SEE SOMEONE SEATED THERE

423
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,826
AT THE REQUEST OF JOHN McCAIN

424
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:43,795
HIMSELF, A FINAL STATEMENT THERE

425
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:45,564
THAT WESTERN VALUES, IN HIS

426
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,432
VIEW, THE GLOBAL ORDER; WORTH

427
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:47,699
DEFENDING.

428
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,168
IN FACT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE

429
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,068
TALKING ABOUT WHETHER THE

430
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,703
RUSSELL BUILDING HERE IN

431
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,705
WASHINGTON WOULD BE RENAMED

432
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:54,773
AFTER JOHN McCAIN.

433
00:17:54,773 --> 00:18:02,080
THERE IS SOME TALK IN BRUSSELS,

434
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:12,224
BELL BELGIUM ABOUT RENAMING THE

435
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,192
NATO HEADQUARTERS AFTER JOHN

436
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:13,525
McCAIN.

437
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,894
>> YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING,

438
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:16,761
THAT IS AN INTERESTING POINT,

439
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:17,028
MARGARET.

440
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:19,531
IN JOURNALISM, WE KNOW

441
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,632
WHO DOES THEIR WORK THEMSELVES,

442
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:24,403
WHO GOES OUT AND CHECKS OUT THE

443
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,103
STORY THEMSELVES.

444
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:26,772
JOHN McCAIN ALWAYS WENT TO THE

445
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,572
SCENE OF THE CRIME.

446
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:30,342
HE WENT TO ALL OF THESE PLACES

447
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,710
AND HE BROUGHT A CERTAIN

448
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,911
CREDIBILITY JUST BECAUSE HE HAD

449
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:38,350
BEEN THERE AND TALKED TO THESE

450
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:38,717
PEOPLE HIMSELF.

451
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,953
>> SYRIA, AFGHANISTAN, WAR

452
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,420
ZONES.

453
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,021
>> THAT MOMENT YOU RECOUNTED

454
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,958
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN, HE WAS AT

455
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,125
THE SECURITY CONFERENCE, HAD A

456
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,294
SPEECH PREPARED AND WENT OFF

457
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,262
SCRIPT AND TOOK ON PUTIN RIGHT

458
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:54,032
THERE IN FRONT OF ALL OF THE

459
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,870
MILITARY LEADERS OF THE MAJOR

460
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,238
COUNTRIES ON THE GLOBE THAT IS

461
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,839
WHAT HE WAS DOING IN A BIG VENUE

462
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,674
LIKE THAT OR CARRYING THE FLAG

463
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,477
OF HIS IDEALS AND WHAT HE CALLED

464
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,312
THE AMERICAN IDEA INTO SMALL

465
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,314
CORNERS OF THE EARTH WHERE HE

466
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,682
THOUGHT PEOPLE WERE BEING

467
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,251
OPPRESSED BY THEIR GOVERNMENT OR

468
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:13,986
SOME OTHER FORCES.

469
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,754
>> WE NOW SEE THE VICE PRESIDENT

470
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,823
OF THE UNITED STATES, EXCUSE ME,

471
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,891
MARGARET, AND HIS WIFE, KAREN

472
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:22,027
PENCE, AS WELL AS THE LEADERS OF

473
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,630
BOTH THE HOUSE AND SENATE

474
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,265
ENTERING NOW TO TAKE THEIR

475
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:26,999
SEATS.

476
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,367
>> BOB, YOU WERE MENTIONING

477
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,502
SENATOR McCAIN'S HUMOR ABOUT THE

478
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,536
INSTITUTION THAT HE LOVES SO

479
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:31,736
MUCH.

480
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:34,306
I ONCE ASKED HIM WHEN HE

481
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,041
REFERRED TO A FORMER COLLEAGUE

482
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,609
AS HIS GOOD FRIEND.

483
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,578
A LOT OF TIMES SENATORS REFER TO

484
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,446
THEMSELVES AS GOOD FRIENDS.

485
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,981
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

486
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:43,648
HE SAID, WELL, MOSTLY NOTHING.

487
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:48,520
HE ALWAYS LIKED TO POKE A LITTLE

488
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,022
FUN AT SOME OF THE

489
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,556
INSTITUTIONAL, AND THERE WE SEE

490
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:52,824
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE STOPPING IN

491
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,594
TO SAY HELLO TO SENATOR McCAIN'S

492
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:55,827
MOTHER.

493
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:56,628
>> YOU KNOW, JOHN McCAIN TALKS

494
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,498
ABOUT IN HIS BOOK THAT HE TALKS

495
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,133
ABOUT BEING THE FATHER OF

496
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,367
ADMIRALS IN THE FAITH OF MY

497
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:02,600
FATHERS.

498
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,271
HE SAYS I WAS MY MOTHER'S SON

499
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,006
AND HE IS REFERRING TO ROBERTA

500
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,975
McCAIN, A REAL PISTOL IN HER OWN

501
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,078
RIGHT WHO HAD A TWIN SISTER AND

502
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,046
THEY USED TO TRAVEL EUROPE

503
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:14,313
TOGETHER.

504
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,914
ONE TIME AT THE AGE OF 91 WHEN

505
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,215
SHE TRIED TO RENT A CAR IN

506
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,517
FRANCE AND THEY REFUSED TO RENT

507
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,485
HER THE CAR, THEY SAID SHE WAS

508
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,788
TOO OLD, SHE JUST BOUGHT A CAR

509
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,256
HERSELF AND SHIPPED IT HOME TO

510
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,291
THE STATES AND DROVE IT ACROSS

511
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:26,524
COUNTRY.

512
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:27,426
JOHN McCAIN RECALLED GETTING A

513
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,727
CALL FROM MY MOTHER SAYING MY

514
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,530
MOTHER IN THE 90s IS DRIVING

ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON A ROAD

516
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,234
TRIP.

517
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,669
AT 106 YEARS OLD TODAY, A

518
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,472
DIFFICULT TASK OF SAYING GOODBYE

519
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:45,744
TO ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN.

520
00:20:45,744 --> 00:21:00,092

THEY HAVE CHANGED THE FLAG ON

00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,466
TOP OF THE CASKET, AS IT WAS

528
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:23,175
RAINING OUTSIDE WHEN THEY

529
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,576
BROUGHT SENATOR McCAIN INTO THE

OF GREAT MEN AND WOMEN, WHO

537
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:12,150
SERVE AS INSPIRATIONS FOR ALL

538
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,821
AMERICANS TO BE THEIR BEST IN

539
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:19,190

00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,865
AMERICAN HERO, SENATOR JOHN

543
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:27,599
McCAIN.

544
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,735
HE DEDICATED HIS ENTIRE LIFE TO

545
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:34,239
PUBLIC SERVICE AS A VOCATION,

546
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,242
FIRST IN THE MILITARY, AND THEN

547
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,443
IN ELECTED OFFICE.

548
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:41,580
HE PLACED HIMSELF DIRECTLY IN

549
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,416
HARM'S WAY DURING THE VIETNAM

550
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,152
WAR IN HIS GREAT SACRIFICE OF

551
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,353
PERSONAL FREEDOM IS WELL KNOWN.

552
00:24:49,353 --> 00:24:52,624
AS A SENATOR, HE SERVED WITH

553
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,494
HONESTY AND INTEGRITY, WORKING

554
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,761
BOTH WITH THOSE WITH WHOM HE

555
00:24:56,761 --> 00:25:02,000
AGREED AND MANY WITH WHOM HE DID

556
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,166
NOT.

557
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,269
HIS WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK THE

558
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,738
TRUTH AS HE UNDERSTOOD IT, EVEN

559
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:12,143
WHEN IT WAS NOT POLITICALLY

560
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:17,816
EXPEDIENT TO DO SO PROVED TO BE

561
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,216

607
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:40,091
I'VE LONG JOKED THAT THE FOLKS

608
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:44,496

DESERVED.

617
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,676

HOUSE. 

697
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:56,981
A NAVY MAN. 

698
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:57,515
A FAMILY MAN. 

699
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:00,751

00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,124
COUNTLESS PEOPLE. 

702
00:32:07,124 --> 00:32:14,866
A MAN OF CONVICTION. 

703
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:15,899
A MAN OF STATE. 

704
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:16,834
THERE'S A LINE FROM HIS 

705
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:21,906
FAREWELL STATEMENT THAT REALLY

707
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:26,544
OUR IDENTITIES AND SENSE OF

00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:31,516
WORTH ARE NOT SCRIBED BUT 

709
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,419
ENLARGED BY SERVING GOOD CAUSES 

710
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:34,952
BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. 

711
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:36,187
THAT'S JOHN MCCAIN. 

712
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:36,988
HOW FITTING AND HOW TRUE.

MCCAIN IS WHAT HE STOOD FOR. 

715
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:50,101
THE RICH BLESSINGS THAT ONLY 

716
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:50,701
FREEDOM CAN BESTOW. 

717
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:53,804
THE PURPOSE THAT A JOIN CAN 

718
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:54,038
BRING. 

719
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:58,710
THE COMMON HUMANITY THAT BURNS 

720
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,580
IN EACH OF OUR HEARTS. 

721
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,348
HEMINGWAY ONCE WROTE THE WORLD 

722
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:05,917
BREAKS EVERYONE AND AFTERWARD, 

723
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:12,323
MANY ARE STRONG AT THE BROKEN 

724
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:12,556
PLACES. 

725
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:14,692
NO ONE, NO ONE WAS STRONGER AT 

726
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:23,101
THE BROKEN PLACES THAN JOHN 

727
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:23,334
MCCAIN. 

728
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,569
THE BROKENNESS WAS HIS 

729
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:24,869
BALANCEST. 

730
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,437
HE NEVER LOST THE JOY THAT TIME 

731
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:29,874
CAN DEAL OR THE EDGE THAT 

732
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:32,610
POLITICAL LIFE SO OFTEN SANDS 

733
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:32,810
AWAY. 

734
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,579
I MYSELF FROM TIME TO TIME 

735
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,782
FOUND MYSELF ON THE RECEIVING 

736
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:45,623

CANDOR HAPPILY SO. 

738
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:48,025
I REMEMBER THINKING MORE THAN 

739
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:50,595
ONCE, YEAH, HE REALLY DOES TALK 

740
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,497
LIKE A SAILOR. 

741
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:56,100
BUT YOU SEE, WITH JOHN, IT WAS 

742
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,503
NEVER FAMED DISAGREEMENT. 

743
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:01,571
THE MAN DIDN'T FAME ANYTHING. 

744
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:05,976
HE JUST RELISHED THE FIGHT. 

745
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:07,612
HE SHOWED US THAT IN THE ARENA, 

746
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,112
THE HONEST BACK AND FORTH, 

747
00:34:09,112 --> 00:34:12,583
THAT'S WHERE THE CAUSE GETS 

748
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:12,815
BIGGER. 

749
00:34:12,815 --> 00:34:17,955
THAT'S WHERE THE TRIUMPH IS ALL 

750
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:18,289
THE SWEETER. 

751
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:23,094
WE GET STRONGER AT THE BROKEN 

752
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:23,327
PLACES. 

753
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:28,331
THOUGH THE HIGHEST SALUTED HIM 

754
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:30,835
HE ATTAINED WHAT IS FAR MORE 

755
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:37,775
ENDURING, THE ABIDING AFFECTION 

756
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:38,609
OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS. 

757
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:42,146
AND IN AN EXAMPLE FOR FUTURE 

758
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:42,478
GENERATIONS. 

759
00:34:42,478 --> 00:34:44,782
SO I THINK AHEAD NOW, I THINK 

760
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,251
AHEAD TO THE DAY WHEN I LIKE SO 

761
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,154
MANY WILL BRING MY OWN CHILDREN 

762
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:53,958
AND PERHAPS THEIR CHILDREN TO 

763
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,193
THAT LAWN IN ANNAPOLIS. 

764
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:55,793
I THINK ABOUT THAT. 

765
00:34:55,793 --> 00:35:02,199
I THINK ABOUT WHAT I MIGHT SAY 

766
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:02,800
TO THEM. 

767
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,839
THIS IS ONE OF THE BRAVEST 

768
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:13,944
SOULS OUR NATION HAS EVER 

769
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:14,211
PRODUCED. 

770
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:15,079
HOWEVER YOU CHOOSE TO DO YOUR 

771
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:22,887
PART, I HOPE YOU DO IT THE WAY 

772
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:23,621
HE DID. 

773
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,655
WITH ENERGY AND URGENCY, 

774
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:25,089
PLAYING FOR KEEPS. 

775
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:28,225
NEVER BACK ON YOUR HEELS. 

776
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:30,561
NEVER LETTING PRINCIPAL YIELD 

777
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:30,928
TO EXPEDIENCE. 

778
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,430
RESISTING THE FALSE ALLURE OF 

779
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,599
THE FLEETING AND BATTENING DOWN 

780
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,801
THE HATCHES WHEN THINGS GET 

781
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,201
ROUGH. 

782
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:44,308
AND ALWAYS, ALWAYS HAVING A 

783
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:48,145
REALLY GOOD STORY TO TELL. 

784
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:50,447
TODAY OUR NATION BOWS IN GRIEF. 

785
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:52,716
BUT HERE, UNDER THE WORK OF 

786
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:58,789
RAMEDE AND IN THE GAZE OF THE 

787
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,792
GREATS WHERE SOLDIERS KNOWN AND 

788
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:02,893
UNKNOWN HAVE LAID BEFORE. 

789
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:03,527
WE HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL THING, 

790
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:09,901
THE CHANCE TO DO FOR THIS MAN 

791
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,068
WHAT HE DID FOR US. 

792
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:12,402
TO STAND UP. 

793
00:36:12,402 --> 00:36:15,006
TO STAND UP AND TO EMBRACE THE 

794
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:15,940
CAUSE OF HIS LIFE. 

795
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,543
NO ONE OF US CAN FULFILL THIS 

796
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:27,718
CHARGE BUT ALL OF US SURE CAN 

797
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:28,286
TRY. 

798
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:34,292
BECAUSE ALL OF THIS, ALL OF 

799
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,395
THIS, ITS WORTH FIGHTING FOR. 

800
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:38,929
GOD BLESS JOHN MCCAIN. 

801
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:52,576

SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN. 

820
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,821
THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME TO BE 

821
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,524
HERE ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL 

822
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:18,162
NATION TO PAY A DEBT OF HONOR 

823
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:21,165
AND RESPECT TO A MAN WHO SERVED 

824
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,402
OUR COUNTRY THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE 

825
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,337
IN UNIFORM AND IN PUBLIC 

826

827
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,608
AND IT'S MY GREAT HONOR TO BE 

828
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:30,808
HERE. 

829
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:36,781
IN THE LONG HISTORY OF OUR 

830
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:37,748
NATION, ONLY 30 AMERICANS HAVE 

831
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,651
LAIN IN STATE HERE IN THE 

832
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,285
UNITED STATES CAPITAL ROTUNDA. 

833
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:45,589
TODAY, AS A REFLECTION OF THE 

834
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,891
ESTEEM IN WHICH HIS COLLEAGUES 

835
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:52,530
AND OUR COUNTRY HOLD HIM, 

836
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,331
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN JOINS THOSE 

837
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:54,799
RANKS. 

838
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,701
THE SON AND THE GRANDSON OF 

839
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:59,336
FOUR STAR ADMIRALS, JOHN CAME 

840
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:02,272
FROM A FAMILY THAT PRIZED 

841
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:02,706
MILITARY SERVICE. 

842
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:04,842
HE ENTERED THE UNITED STATES 

843
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,579
NAVAL ACADEMY WHEN HE WAS JUST 

844
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,447
17 YEARS OLD. 

845
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:10,915
HIS SERVICE AS A NAVAL AVIATOR 

846
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,983
TOOK HIM AROUND THE WORLD AND 

847
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,819
EVENTUALLY TO THE WAR IN 

848
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:15,119
VIETNAM. 

849
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,122
IT WAS THERE ON HIS 23rd 

850
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:23,160
BOMBING RUN THAT JOHN WAS SHOT 

851
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,593
DOWN AND CAPTURED. 

852
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:24,462
REFUSING EARLY RELEASE FOR THE 

853
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,196
SAKE OF HIS COMRADES, HE 

854
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:35,372
ENDURED FIVE AND A HALF YEARS 

855
00:39:35,372 --> 00:39:37,007
OF CONFINEMENT AND TORTURE. 

856
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,942
THEN AS NOW, AMERICANS MARVELED 

857
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:46,550
AT THE IRON WILL OF JOHN 

858
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:46,783
MCCAIN. 

859
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:50,054
BUT CAPTIVITY DID NOT DIMINISH 

860
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,590
JOHN'S SENSE OF CALLING, OR HIS 

861
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,890
COMMITMENT TO MISSION. 

862
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,427
AS HE WOULD LATER SAY, I FELL 

863
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,362
IN LOVE WITH MY COUNTRY WHEN I 

864
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:02,666
WAS A PRISONER IN SOMEONE 

865
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:02,899
ELSE'S. 

866
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:08,572
AND AFTER HE MADE IT HOME, JOHN 

867
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,606
TRADED SERVICE IN THE UNIFORM 

868
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:10,140
OF THE UNITED STATES FOR 

869
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,408
SERVICE IN CONGRESS, EXCHANGING 

870
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:15,679
THE RANK OF CAPTAIN FOR 

871
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,482
CONGRESS MAN AND LATER SENATOR. 

872
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:22,319
FOR 35 YEARS, JOHN SERVED IN 

873
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,988
THESE VERY HALLS UNDER THIS 

874
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:24,455
VERY DOME. 

875
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:28,659
AND HE FOUGHT FOR WHAT HE 

876
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,392
BELIEVED IN. 

877
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:34,965
IN MY YEARS IN CONGRESS, AND AS 

878
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:39,036
VICE PRESIDENT, WE DIDN'T 

879
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,570
ALWAYS AGREE EITHER. 

880
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,275
AND HE ALMOST ALWAYS NOTICED. 

881
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,943
BUT HIS SUPPORT FOR LIMITED 

882
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,913
GOVERNMENT, FOR TAX REFORM AND 

883
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:52,349
SUPPORT FOR OUR ARMED FORCES 

884
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,484
SURELY LEFT OUR NATION MORE 

885
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,719
PROSPEROUS AND MORE SECURE AND 

886
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,354
HE WILL BE MISSED. 

887
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,956
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID 

888
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:03,761
YESTERDAY, WE RESPECT HIS 

889
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:04,761
SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY. 

890
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:06,696
LIKE MANY OF YOU GATHERED HERE 

891
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:08,632
I ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF 

892
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,669
TRAVELING WITH SENATOR MCCAIN 

893
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,171
TO VISIT OUR TROOPS OVER SEAS. 

894
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:14,805
EARLIER THIS WEEK, I TOLD CINDY 

895
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:20,110
OF THE TIME ON A TRIP THROUGH 

896
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:20,310
IRAQ. 

897
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,647
AFTER ANOTHER 18 HOUR DAY, WHEN 

898
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,082
I WAS LITERALLY FALLING ASLEEP 

899
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:31,088
IN THE MIDDLE OF A DINNER WITH 

900
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,523
IRAQI OFFICIALS, AFTER THE 

901
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,458
DINNER, JOHN, WHO WAS MORE THAN 

902
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,628
20 YEARS OLDER THAN ME, WALKED 

903
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:41,865
UP, PUT HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER 

904
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:44,034
AND SAID MIKE, WE'VE GOT A FEW 

905
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,270
MORE MEETINGS TONIGHT BUT WHY 

906
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,437
DON'T YOU TURN IN. 

907
00:41:47,437 --> 00:41:58,248
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE 

908
00:41:58,248 --> 00:41:58,548
SOME REST. 

909
00:41:58,548 --> 00:41:58,882
THANKS, JOHN. 

910
00:41:58,882 --> 00:41:59,750
HONESTLY, SEEING HIM DOWN 

911
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,087
RANGE, I NEVER TRAVELED WITH A 

912
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:08,626
COLLEAGUE WHO WAS BETTER TO OUR 

913
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,728
ENLISTED OR HARDER ON OUR 

914
00:42:11,728 --> 00:42:11,995
GENERALS. 

915
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:12,595
JOHN MCCAIN LOVED THE MEN AND 

916
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:13,263
WOMEN WHO SERVED IN THE UNIFORM 

917
00:42:13,263 --> 00:42:15,866
OF THE UNITED STATES AND HE WAS 

918
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:23,173
A CHAMPION OF OUR ARMED FORCES 

919
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,674
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER. 

920
00:42:24,674 --> 00:42:27,945
IN EVERY GENERATION THERE ARE 

921
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,280
THOSE WHO PUT COUNTRY FIRST WHO 

922
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:35,118
PRIDE SERVICE AHEAD OF SELF, 

923
00:42:35,118 --> 00:42:37,087
WHO SUMON IDEALISM FROM A 

924
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:37,421
CYNICAL AGE. 

925
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:40,090
JOHN MCCAIN WAS SUCH A MAN. 

926
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:45,629
TODAY, HE LIES IN THE PLACE 

927
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:49,266
WHERE HE SERVED TO THE LAST THE 

928
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,167

THE AUDIENCE AT THE U.S. 

1031
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:51,648
CAPITAL CEREMONY STOPPING TO 

1032
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:52,281
PAY THEIR RESPECTS. 

1033
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:55,084
MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL 

1034
00:55:55,084 --> 00:55:56,753
CALLED JOHN MCCAIN A 

1035
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:57,220
GENERATIONAL LEADER. 

1036
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,088
PAUL RYAN SAID HE WAS ONE OF 

1037
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:01,690
THE BRAVEST SOULS OUR NATION 

1038
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:02,591
HAS PRODUCED. 

1039
00:56:02,591 --> 00:56:04,961
BOB SCHAFER IN WASHINGTON YOUR 

1040
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:05,728
REACTION, BOB? 

1041
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:11,701
>> I THINK JOHN MCCAIN WAS 

1042
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:15,271
MAYBE THE BRAVEST PERSON I EVER 

1043
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:15,471
KNEW. 

1044
00:56:15,471 --> 00:56:16,105
HE WASN'T AFRAID OF ANYTHING 

1045
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:20,477
AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT I WILL 

1046
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:24,547
ALWAYS REMEMBER ABOUT HIM. 

1047
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,181
HE WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED THIS 

1048
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:25,581
CEREMONY TODAY. 

1049
00:56:25,581 --> 00:56:26,316
HE WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED IT 

1050
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,485
BUT I THINK HE WOULD ALSO BE 

1051
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:29,686
READY TO MOVE ON. 

1052
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:32,956
HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MADE A 

1053
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,724
LITTLE JOKE OF SOME KIND IF HE 

1054
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,594
HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO WATCH AND 

1055
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:38,628
PERHAPS HE IS WATCHING. 

1056
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:43,333
AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT HE SAID. 

1057
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,501
I VISITED HIM IN MAY AT HIS 

1058
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:45,601
PLACE OUT THERE IN ARIZONA. 

1059
00:56:45,601 --> 00:56:48,338
HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO DIE. 

1060
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,973
HE KNEW THE TIME WAS COMING 

1061
00:56:50,973 --> 00:56:51,240
SHORTLY. 

1062
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,542
BUT JOHN MCCAIN REALLY HAD NO 

1063
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:53,809
REGRETS. 

1064
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:56,012
HE WROTE I HATE TO LEAVE LIFE. 

1065
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,747
I DON'T HAVE A COMPLAINT 

1066
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,883
THOUGH, NOT ONE BECAUSE IT'S 

1067
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:03,987
BEEN QUITE A RIDE. 

1068
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:06,021
THAT WAS JOHN MCCAIN. 

1069
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:06,388
GOD BLESS HIM. 

1070
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:09,726
>> AND BOB, WE HEARD FROM MITCH 

1071
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,594
MCCONNELL THAT JOHN MCCAIN 

1072
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,228
REPRESENTED AMERICA'S FIGHTING 

1073
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:12,461
SPIRIT. 

1074
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:13,363
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 

1075
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:16,032
LOOKING TO THIS MOMENT FOR A 

1076
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:17,901
BIT OF SPIRIT THEMSELVES AND 

1077
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,870
THE LESSON HERE IS THE ABILITY 

1078
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,639
TO BE BIPARTISAN AND THE 

1079
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,207
ABILITY TO BE OPTIMISTIC IN THE 

1080
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:24,574
DARKEST HOURS. 

1081
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,376
IT'S SOMETHING THAT SOME ARE 

1082
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:27,877
HOPING IF THERE IS MEANING TO 

1083
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:30,479
BE TAKEN FROM ALL OF THIS, IT 

1084
00:57:30,479 --> 00:57:31,848
