1
00:00:00,141 --> 00:00:02,977
WE HAD A WRESTLER ON WHO ON THE

2
00:00:02,977 --> 00:00:07,515
VERGE OF BECOMING A MAYOR IN

3
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:08,015
TENNESSEE.

4
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:08,850
WE'LL SEE.

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,018
BY THE WAY, A NEW REPORT OUT

6
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:13,754
THIS PAST YEAR ON AVERAGE, A LOT

7
00:00:13,754 --> 00:00:15,089
OF COUNTRIES VOTED WERE THE

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,457
UNITED STATES ABOUT A THIRD OF

9
00:00:16,457 --> 00:00:16,991
THE TIME.

10
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:20,161
THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO

11
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:24,398
THE U.N. NIKKI HALEY SAID THAT'S

12
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:26,501
NOT A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

13
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:29,437
IS IT TIME TO RETHINK OUR

14
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:33,174
FRIENDS OR PULL SOME AID?

15
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:35,343
ONE OF THE BRAVEST PEOPLE I

16
00:00:35,343 --> 00:00:35,643
KNOW.

17
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:38,312
SHE'S GOES BACK ON THE VERY

18
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:39,847
PEOPLE THAT HATE HER.

19
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:41,949
WE ADMIRE HER.

20
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:42,883
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

21
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:44,852
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.

22
00:00:44,852 --> 00:00:47,555
>> SHE'S NOT SAYING PAY TO PLAY

23
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:49,056
BUT DON'T PLAY THIS GAME.

24
00:00:49,056 --> 00:00:50,358
WE WON'T PLAY IT WITH YOU

25
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:50,691
ANYMORE.

26
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:51,225
>> IT'S IMPORTANT.

27
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:52,960
IN A REAL DEMOCRACY, YOU DON'T

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,928
WANT PAY TO PLAY.

29
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:57,431
THE U.N. IS NOT A REAL

30
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:57,798
DEMOCRACY.

31
00:00:57,798 --> 00:00:58,933
THEY HAVE VOTES.

32
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,501
THE MORE USEFUL ILLUSTRATION OR

33
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:04,205
EXAMPLE IS THE U.N. IS AN ANIMAL

34
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:04,504
FARM.

35
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:05,206
IT'S A COLLECTIVE.

36
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:09,009
THIS IS CALLING OUT MAINLY

37
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:10,678
DICTATORSHIPS, BADLY RULED

38
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:11,879
STATES THAT VOTE NOT ONLY

39
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,680
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES BUT

40
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,148
AGAINST THE THINGS WE STAND FOR,

41
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:15,015
AGAINST THE FREE WORLD.

42
00:01:15,015 --> 00:01:15,983
>> Neil: THAT'S THE NATURE OF

43
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:16,951
THE BEAST, RIGHT?

44
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,954
>> IT IS.

45
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,522
IT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE THE

46
00:01:21,522 --> 00:01:24,191
U.S. AMBASSADOR CALLING THEM

47
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:24,458
OUT.

48
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,759
IT'S A GOOD THING FOR AMERICA TO

49
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,862
TELL THE WORLD WE'RE NOT

50
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:29,997
INTERESTING IN SUBSIDIZING

51
00:01:29,997 --> 00:01:34,668
COUNTRIES THAT VOTE AGAINST US,

52
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:38,105
>> Neil: LOOK, WE HELP A LOT OF

53
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:38,772
THESE COUNTRIES.

54
00:01:38,772 --> 00:01:40,241
THEY COME BACK AND ZOOM US.

55
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:40,741
>> YES.

56
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:42,576
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY NO, THE

57
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:44,712
U.S. IS NOT INTERESTING IN BEING

58
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:46,714
YOUR CHIEF CHUMP.

59
00:01:46,714 --> 00:01:48,215
>> Neil: SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE

60
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:49,316
ACT ON THAT?

61
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:52,319
>> POSSIBLY NOT A LOT.

62
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,722
CHINA IS CHANGING THINGS.

63
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:55,422
IT'S DIFFICULT.

64
00:01:55,422 --> 00:01:57,324
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR

65
00:01:57,324 --> 00:01:57,825
VOTES.

66
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:00,160
THE MESSAGE, WHAT YOU MAY

67
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,762
SUCCEED IN DOING IS SENDING THE

68
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:03,664
MESSAGE THAT THE U.S. IS NOT

69
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:05,165
INTERESTED IN BEING PLAYED

70
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:05,499
ANYMORE.

71
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:06,467
WE'VE WISED UP.

72
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:10,404
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE WORLD

73
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:10,937
TO UNDERSTAND.

74
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:12,172
FOR INSTANCE, NORTH KOREA TO

75
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:12,873
TAKE NOTE.

76
00:02:12,873 --> 00:02:15,943
WE'RE NOT SO EASILY FOOLED.

77
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:18,412
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

78
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:21,014
DOING I THINK ITS BEST NOT TO BE

79
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:22,449
LIKE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

80
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:25,519
WHICH SIGNED ON TO THE TERRIBLE

81
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,087
NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN THAT

82
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:30,224
PINNED THAT SIGN, "KICK ME."

83
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:33,060
>> Neil: WHAT HAPPENS IF HE NIXS

84
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,228
THAT AND STARTS FROM SCRATCH?

85
00:02:34,228 --> 00:02:36,396
>> WE'LL BE FACING REALITY.

86
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:37,431
IT HAS ITS USES.

87
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:38,699
LET'S LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM.

88
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,502
THIS DEAL IS NEVER GOING TO STOP

89
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:44,605
IRAN FROM GETTING THE BOMB.

90
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:47,841
I HOPE A SIMILAR CLEAR-EYED

91
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:49,309
VISION GOES TO NORTH KOREA.

92
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:51,745
>> Neil: WE'RE GETTING REPORTS

93
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:54,181
THAT NORTH KOREA HAS RELEASED

94
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:56,383
THREE AMERICAN CITIZENS.

95
00:02:56,383 --> 00:02:58,519
THIS WAS PART OF WHAT OUR LIST

96
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,754
OF INTERESTS WERE IN GOING TO

97
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:01,221
NORTH KOREA.

98
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:03,023
THEY'RE ALREADY LOOKING TO

99
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:03,891
RELEASE THEM NOW.

100
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:05,826
>> I WOULD READ NOTHING INTO IT.

101
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:08,462
THE PROBLEM IS, NORTH KOREA CAN

102
00:03:08,462 --> 00:03:09,896
COLLECT MORE HOSTAGES ANY TIME.

103
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:11,498
THEY HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME FOR

104
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:11,798
YEARS.

105
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:13,400
>> Neil: BUT THIS ON TOP OF

106
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,371
SAYING YEAH, WE'RE OPEN UP TO

107
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:17,871
DENUCLEARIZATION.

108
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,439
YEAH, WE WANT TO CEASE

109
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,107
HOSTILITIES WITH THE SOUTH.

110
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:21,208
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

111
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,143
>> THEY WERE DUE TO COME BACK

112
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:26,380
AND TRY TO COLLECT WHATEVER THEY

113
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,713
COULD.

114
00:03:26,713 --> 00:03:30,016
>> Neil: BUT THIS IS A 180.

115
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:32,686
I DON'T KNOW WHAT --

116
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:33,720
>> SAME GUY HERE.

117
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,122
THEY'RE PREPARING TO GAME US.

118
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:36,823
THAT'S WHY I WAS SAYING, IT'S SO

119
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:37,858
IMPORTANT TO BE SENDING THE

120
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:38,792
MESSAGE WE WON'T BE.

121
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,660
AS QUICKLY AS THEY FLIPPED

122
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,262
AROUND FROM TESTING A HYDROGEN

123
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:43,663
BOMB EIGHT MONTHS AGO TO NOW

124
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:46,499
WALKING HAND AND HAND WITH THE

125
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:49,803
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA, THEY

126
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:53,340
CAN FLIP THE OTHER WAY.

127
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,442
UNFORTUNATELY THE RECORD IS THAT

128
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:56,743
NORTH KOREA CUTS THESE MARVELOUS

129
00:03:56,743 --> 00:03:57,744
DEALS, WE CELEBRATE.

130
00:03:57,744 --> 00:03:59,479
THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED.

131
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,216
THEN THEY BEGIN RENEGOTIATING,

132
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:03,583
CHEATING.

133
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,884
THAT'S THE DANGER HERE.

134
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:06,920
>> Neil: A WIDE-EYED REAL LIST.

135
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,555
THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS NOT

136
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:10,156
CONFIRMING THIS TALK THAT IS

137
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:12,359
BREAKING NOW THAT THREE AMERICAN

138
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:14,160
PRISONERS THAT HAVE BEEN HELD IN

139
00:04:14,160 --> 00:00:00,000
NORTH KOREA, SOME FOR A NUMBER
