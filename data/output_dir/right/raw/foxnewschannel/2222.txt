27
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:00,431
THE QUESTIONS, 30 IF THEY ARE

28
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:02,033
GIVEN A FOLLOW-UP AFTER THAT

29
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:03,501
QUESTION AND THEY ALSO GET 30

30
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:04,269
SECONDS IF THEIR NAME IS

31
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,838
MENTIONED BY ONE OF THE OTHER

32

[BELL SOUNDING]

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,814
WE DO NOT LIKE TO DO THAT,

38
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,749
BECAUSE SOME OF THE DOGS AT HOME

39
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:19,417
THINKING THAT SOMEBODY IS AT THE

40
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:19,851
DOOR.

41
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:22,020
LET’S TRY NOT TO USE THE BELL

42
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,355
AND GET GOING.

43
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:24,790
>> Martha: AS YOU ALL KNOW,

44
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,657
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC HAS HIT THE

45
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:26,224
COUNTRY HARD.

46
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:28,293
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN GREAT

47
00:01:28,293 --> 00:01:29,094
DETAIL, BUT LET’S GET STARTED AT

48
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:32,197
THE TOP OF OUR QUESTIONS.

49
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:33,031
>> Bret: GROSSMAN JENKINS, YOU

50
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:34,533
ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE STAGE

51
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:35,867
BECAUSE YOU ARE LEADING IN THE

63
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,390
SO HERE’S THE QUESTION, HOW DO

65
00:01:59,058 --> 00:02:01,193
VOTERS THAT YOU CAN DRAIN THE

66
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:02,228
SWAMP IF THEY THINK THAT YOU ARE

67
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:03,596
A PART OF IT?

68
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:07,266

00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:10,436
HERE THIS EVENING.

71
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:11,904
FROM A PROUD WEST VIRGINIA, I

HAVE NOT BEEN UP IN THE SWAMP A

73
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,208
VERY LONG.

74
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,043
I TOOK OUT A 38 YEAR INCUMBENT

75
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:18,845
JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

76
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:21,114
I AM UP IN WASHINGTON ACTUALLY

77
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:22,415
WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

78
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:24,651
I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS

79
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:25,451
ESTABLISHMENT.

80
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:26,986
I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THE SWAMP.

81
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:29,389
AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE AN

82
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:30,623
ELECTION MAKES.

83
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:32,425
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE

84
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:34,227
WEST VIRGINIA TURNING AROUND.

85
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:35,828
WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP,

86
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:37,730
STANDING UP WITH HIM.

87
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,732
I PROUDLY ENDORSED

88
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:42,302
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE MAY

89
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:43,136
THE ONLY ONE UP HERE ON THE

90
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:45,405
STAGE WHO DID THAT AND HAVE BEEN

91
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:47,474
STANDING WITH HIM EACH AND EVERY

92
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:48,008
DAY.

93
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:51,811
SO WE ARE BRINGING REAL RESULTS,

94
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:54,614
YES, WE ARE CUTTING TAXES AND

95
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:55,615
REDUCING REGULATION.

96
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:56,917
MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN

97
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:57,818
WEST VIRGINIA.

98
00:02:57,818 --> 00:02:58,985
LEADING THE COUNTRY IN A LOT OF

99
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:01,254
WAYS TO STANDING UP FOR WHAT WE

100
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:03,290
BELIEVE IS WEST VIRGINIANS.

101
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,258
>> Bret: CONGRESSMAN,

102
00:03:05,258 --> 00:03:05,625
THANK YOU.

103
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,494
>> Martha: MR. BLANKENSHIP,

104
00:03:07,494 --> 00:03:09,963
YOU WERE IMPRISONED ON A

105
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:11,632
CONVICTION IN THE MINE EXPLOSION

106
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:13,700
CASE, YOU HAVE BLAMED THE OBAMA

107
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,235
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THAT

108
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:16,603
ADMINISTRATION’S WAR ON COAL,

109
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:18,005
BUT TOO MANY OF THESE MINING

110
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,773
FAMILIES DID BLAME YOU.

111
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:21,842
CAN YOU BLAME THEM IF THEY DO

112
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:24,611
NOT THINK THAT IT IS RIGHT FOR

113
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,146
YOU TO GO FROM THE JAIL CELL TO

114
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:26,947
THE UNITED STATES SENATE?

115
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,148
>> I DO NOT THINK THAT IS A

116
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:29,250
QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO BE

117
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:29,583
ASKING.

118
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,918
TO THE QUESTION WE NEED TO BE

119
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:33,020
ASKING IS WHETHER WE CAN PREVENT

120
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,355
A BIG BRANCH FROM HAPPENING

121
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:35,189
AGAIN.

122
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:36,991
AT THIS TIME AND HAVE THEM

123
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:38,592
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TOOK IT

124
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:40,995
IN HALF AND FINISHED ALMOST

125
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:42,697
EIGHT HOURS BEFORE THERE WAS

126
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:44,632
EXISTENCE FOR 17 YEARS EXPLODED.

127
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:45,733
BASICALLY THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT

128
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:46,934
BLAME ME, THEY BLAME THE COAL

129
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:49,504
MINERS WERE NOT DOING THEIR JOB,

130
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:52,406
WHICH WAS TERRIBLY UNTRUE.

131
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:53,841
NEARLY 400 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,

132
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:54,809
THEY DID THEIR JOB.

133
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:56,444
AND I PLEA BARGAIN DURING THE

134
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,478
TRIAL, THAT WOULD’VE BEEN

135
00:03:57,478 --> 00:03:58,913
AMAZING THAT THE MINERS DID NOT

136
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:02,817
DO THEIR JOB, I CANNOT DO THAT.

137
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:03,718
FACING 30 YEARS IN PRISON FOR A

138
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:06,221
FIXED CHARGE, AND I BEAT ALL

139
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:07,622
THREE OF THE FELONY IS, THEY PUT

140
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,090
ME IN JAIL, BECAUSE I DID NOT

141
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,093
STOP THE COAL MINERS FROM

142
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:13,628
TELLING EACH OTHER THAT THE

143
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,395
INSPECTORS HAD ARRIVED.

144
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:16,564
THAT IS NOT A LAW THAT IS ON THE

145
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:17,365
BOOKS.

146
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:18,966
THAT IS A LAW THAT THE OBAMA

147
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,802
PROSECUTORS MADE UP IN

148
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,004
REPARATION FOR THE TRIAL.

149
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:25,807
THE TRIAL WAS VIOLATED OF A

150
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,575
PERSON’S HUMAN RIGHTS TO A FAIR

151
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:26,875
TRIAL.

152
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,878
TODAY DID THINGS LIKE IN ORDER

153
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:31,379
TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE THAT

154
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,748
THEY HAD TO GIVE THE DOCUMENTS

155
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:34,216
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO USE AT

156
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:36,084
TRIAL, THEY GAVE US 1 MILLION

157
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:37,018
AND A HALF DOCUMENTS AND SAID

158
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:40,155
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO USE THE

159
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,390
DOCUMENTS IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

160
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,824
IT IS INCREDIBLE.

161
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,026
THEY SENT ME IMPRISONED FOR A

162
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,428
MISDEMEANOR, I WAS THE ONLY

163
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:47,296
PRISONER THAT WAS A MISDEMEANOR.

164
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:48,430
IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING

165
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,033
TO THE END THAT IT WAS A FAKE

166
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:51,433
PROSECUTION.

167
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:52,901
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO

168
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:54,136
THOSE THAT SAY THAT YOU HAVE

169
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:55,638
MADE IT ABOUT YOU?

170
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:56,906
DO YOU ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY

171
00:04:56,906 --> 00:04:59,475
FOR THE DEATHS OF THOSE 29

172
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:00,042
MINERS?

173
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:02,378
>> I AM ACCEPTING THE

174
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:03,145
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO EVERYTHING

175
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:05,214
I CAN TO KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING

176
00:05:05,214 --> 00:05:05,614
AGAIN.

177
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:07,516
THE GOVERNMENT CUTS IT IN HALF.

178
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,151
THE JOB WAS FINISHED EIGHT HOURS

179
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:10,019
BEFORE THE EXPLOSION.

180
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:10,820
THERE’S NOT MUCH YOU CAN SAY

181
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,620
ABOUT IT.

182
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,456
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN EXPLOSIVE

183
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,257
ATMOSPHERE NO MATTER WHETHER YOU

184
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:18,628
HAVE SHARP BIDS, DOLE BEDS, PLUG

185
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:21,163
WATER SPRAYS, NO SPRAYS COMING

186
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:22,598
HAVE TO HAVE AN EXPLOSIVE

187
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:22,999
ATMOSPHERE.

188
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:24,700
TO THE WAY YOU PREVENT IT IS A

189
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,470
LOT OF AIRFLOW, AND THESE GUYS

190
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,005
THEY DO THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO

191
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:30,239
MAKE THAT CHANGE.

192
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,940
THEY SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO THEM

193
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,042
AND TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

194
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:33,743
>> Martha: WHY DID YOU INSIST

195
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:35,645
THAT THEY DID NOT MAKE THAT

196
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:36,012
CHANGE?

197
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:37,280
>> BECAUSE I WAS NOT AWARE THAT

198
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,048
THEY WERE MAKING THE CHANGE.

199
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,384
WHEN YOU HAVE 119 COAL MINES, IT

200
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,118
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP WITH

201
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:45,789
WHAT EVERYONE IS DOING.

202
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:49,559
WE NEED TO BRING IT TO A

203
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:50,260
REGULATORY INSPECTOR GROUP AND

204
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,028
INVESTIGATIVE GROUP LIKE THE NTS

205
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:56,099
IN THE AVIATION INDUSTRY WHEN

206
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:59,035
YOU USE THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE

207
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:01,538
WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE A RELIEF

208
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:02,272
VALVE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS

209
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:04,441
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU

210
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:07,177
DO NOT WANT THEM TO DO FOR YOUR

211
00:06:07,177 --> 00:06:08,411
ENGINEERS AT ODDS WITH THE

212
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,045
GOVERNMENT ENGINEERS, THEY

213
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:10,080
SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DICTATE

214
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,649
WHAT YOU DO.

215
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:13,884
>> Bret: MR. MORRISEY, THIS IS

216
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:15,519
NOT YOUR FIRST ATTEMPT TO GET

217
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,253
ELECTED INTO CONGRESS.

218
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:21,792
YOU RAN IN YOUR NEW IN JERSEY,

219
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,227
WHICH JENKINS MENTIONS ON THE

220
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:23,694
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

221
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:24,661
JOE MANCHIN GREW UP HERE AND

222
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:25,462
NEVER LEFT.

223
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:27,464
HE WILL SURELY CALL YOU A

224
00:06:27,464 --> 00:06:27,898
CARPETBAGGER.

225
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:30,300
SO HOW DO YOU COUNTER THAT

226
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:30,601
CLAIM?

227
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:33,370
>> FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR

228
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,205
THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE

229
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:36,674
FOX NEWS IS GIVING US TO BE HERE

230
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:37,441
TONIGHT TO SHOW OFF

231
00:06:37,441 --> 00:06:37,875
WEST VIRGINIA.

232
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,811
WE HAVE AN AMAZING STATE.

233
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:42,213
AND I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT I

234
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:43,814
AM ONE OF THE FOLKS UP HERE WHO

235
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:47,218
MOVED TO THE STATES BY CHOICE.

00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:48,052
I LOVE WEST VIRGINIA WITH ALL OF

237
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:49,220
THE FIBER IN MY BEGINNING.

238
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,322
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

239
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:52,790
WHEN I RAN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL,

240
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,192
I KNEW THAT WE NEEDED A CHANGE.

241
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:57,195
WE HAD A 20 YEAR INCUMBENT WHO

242
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:58,162
WAS WREAKING HAVOC ON THE STATE

243
00:06:58,162 --> 00:06:58,863
OF WEST VIRGINIA.

244
00:06:58,863 --> 00:07:01,599
I KNEW THAT WE NEEDED A

245
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,968
CONSERVATIVE FIGHTER TO GO AFTER

246
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:05,403
OBAMA OVERREACH AND GIVE OBAMA

247
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:06,237
EVERYTHING HE HAD.

248
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:08,906
FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO WIN IN

249
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,508
COURT TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME

250
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:14,012
AGAINST BARACK OBAMA.

251
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:15,013
IF ANYBODY RAISES WEST VIRGINIA

252
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:17,182
VALUES, SHOW ME SOMEONE WHO HAS

253
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,784
DONE MORE TO GO AFTER THE

254
00:07:19,784 --> 00:07:20,852
ABSOLUTE WRETCHED EXCESS OF THE

255
00:07:20,852 --> 00:07:21,986
BARACK OBAMA ERA.

256
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:24,122
WE WENT AFTER IT AND WE WON THE

257
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:26,391
CLEAN POWER PLAN, THE LEGAL

258
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:26,725
AMNESTY.

259
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:28,460
WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR

260
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:28,994
PRO-LIFE PRINCIPLES.

261
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:31,529
WE ARE THE CONSERVATIVE FIGHTER

262
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:32,330
OF ANYONE STANDING HERE TONIGHT.

263
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,031

264
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:34,466
WATCHING ALL OF THE COMMERCIALS

265
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,134
AND THE ADS GOING AFTER EACH

266
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:36,434
OTHER.

267

SO CONGRESSMAN JENKINS, FROM

THEM?

271
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,643

272
00:07:44,643 --> 00:07:45,811
RAN FOR CONGRESS IN NEW JERSEY.

273
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:48,981

REPRESENTING OUR VALUES.

YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR VALUES

281
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,196
JUST BECAUSE YOU CHANGE YOUR

300
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:37,196
PATRICK MORRISEY GREW UP IN

301
00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:38,563
JERSEY, MADE ALL OF HIS LIVING

302
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:41,634

305
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:45,805
WENT BACK TO JERSEY TO RUN FOR

306
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:46,172
CONGRESS.

307
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:49,776
AND HE DID ON HIS JERSEY VALUES.

308
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:51,411
HE CAME IN LAST PLACE IN THE

309
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:52,912
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, THEN HE

310
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:54,614
MOVED BACK TO WASHINGTON, D.C.,

311
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:57,417
MAKING MORE MONEY.

312
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,518
THEN HE CAME TO WEST VIRGINIA,

PUT HIS NAME ON THE BALLOT.

314
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:02,022
WEST VIRGINIANS SEE THROUGH

MOVED TO WEST VIRGINIA OUT OF

THE NORTHEAST.

322
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:16,336
ONCE THEY SET UP SHOP, IT IS

323
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:18,972
TOUGH TO GET THEM OUT.

324
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:20,173

00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:04,813
VOTING RECORD, PATRICK, DAWN,

379
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:06,381
THEY CAN TALK ABOUT HOW THEY

380
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:10,219
WILL VOTE TO 100% PRO-LIFE, 100%

381
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:10,986
DEFENDING THE SECOND AMENDMENT

382
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,221
WITH THE NATIONAL RIGHT TO LIFE,

383
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:14,623
I WILL TELL YOU THAT I WILL NOT

384
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:17,726
ALLOW YOU TO CHALLENGE MY

385
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:20,763
WEST VIRGINIA VALUES, MY PROUD

386
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,430
HISTORY OF FIGHTING FOR OUR

387
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,833
STATE EACH AND EVERY DAY OF MY

388
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,401
LIFE.

389
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:26,769
>> Bret: MR. BLANKENSHIP,

390
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,137
LET’S GET YOU IN THE MIX PAID

391
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:30,139
WHEN YOU ARE ASKED ABOUT THE

392
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,774
CARPETBAGGER QUESTION, A LOT OF

393
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,776
PEOPLE HAVE HOUSES IN DIFFERENT

394
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,178
STATES, BUT ISN’T IT TRUE THAT

395
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:37,780
YOU LIVE IN NEVADA?

396
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,983
YOU PAY TAXES IN NEVADA?

397
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:42,218
AND YOUR PROBATION OFFICER IS IN

398
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:43,986
NEVADA, BUT YOU ARE RUNNING FOR

399
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:46,389
U.S. SENATE IN WEST VIRGINIA?

400
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:50,093
>> YES, PROBABLY PAY MORE TAXES

401
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:51,394
THAN ANYBODY ON THIS STATE TO

402
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,896
WEST VIRGINIA.

403
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,198
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

404
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:58,001
AND IF IT WAS NOT FOR ME,

405
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,170
UP HERE.

406
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,806
IT IS FUNNY THAT PAT SAYS ONLY

407
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,207
CONSERVATIVE ON THE STAGE,

408
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:05,475
CONSERVATIVES WERE NOT EVEN

409
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,610
POPULAR IN WEST VIRGINIA THEN I

410
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,979
CAUSED THEM TO BE CONSERVATIVE

411
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,281
BY INVESTING $5 MILLION OF MY

412
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:12,382
OWN MONEY.

413
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:13,984
HONESTY, IT IS FUNNY TO HEAR

414
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,385
POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT HONESTY.

415
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:17,053
I THINK THAT THAT IS ODD.

416
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:19,856
AND AS FAR AS A VOTING RECORD, I

417
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:23,393
VOTED FOR THE UNBORN AND I HAVE

418
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:24,594
GIVEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

419
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:25,829
DOLLARS TO WRITE FOR LIFE.

420
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,030
THAT IS A REAL VOTE.

421
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,368
BEING ABLE TO USE THE STATES

422
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:32,536
MONEY, THAT IS PRETTY EASY TO

423
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:33,403
DO.

424
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:34,805
IT DOES NOT TAKE ANY PERSONAL

425
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:36,206
SACRIFICE TO DO THAT.

426
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,307
I HAVE MADE A LOT OF PERSONAL

427
00:12:37,307 --> 00:12:40,177
SACRIFICES IF YOU WILL TO STOP

428
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,411
THE BOMB THAT WOULD HAVE WASTED

429
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:45,783
MONEY IN WEST VIRGINIA CUT YOUR

430
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:46,150
FOOD TAX.

431
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,352
THOSE TYPES OF SACRIFICES WHEN

432
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,054
YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE OR YOU

433
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:50,988
TAKE A POSITION THAT IS NOT

434
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:52,556
POPULAR IS WHAT IT IS GOING TO

435
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:53,290
TAKE TO DRAIN THE SWAMP.

436
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,194
YOU CANNOT DRAIN THE SWAMP BEING

437
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:57,795
LIKE THE SWAMP.

438
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:59,363
>> Bret: IF JOE MANCHIN COMES

439
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,097
AFTER YOU FOR LIVING IN NEVADA,

440
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:01,966
WHAT YOU SEE A QUESTION MARK >>

441
00:13:01,966 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT HE HAS LIVED IN D.C. TOO
