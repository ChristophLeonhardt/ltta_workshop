>> THERE IS THE EMERGENCE OF
EXCLUSIVE DATING APPS THAT ARE
NOT OPEN TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO
JOIN, YOU HAVE TO APPLY AND IT
IS SPECIFICALLY MATCHES PEOPLE
WHO ARE CONSIDERED ELITE.
PEOPLE WHO HAVE CERTAIN
SCHOOLING, CERTAIN CAREERS,
CERTAIN SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, THERE
WAS AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE
TAKEN ON THESE DATING APPS AND
HOW IT COULD FURTHER DIVIDE THE
COUNTRY OR AT LEAST PUSH FOR
MORE ANY QUALITY IN THE COUNTRY.
OFTENTIMES WHEN PEOPLE WOULD
FIND A MATE AND THEN GET MARRIED
IT HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH
PROXIMITY OR WHO YOU
HAD ACCESS TO.
NOW WITH ONLINE DATING IF YOU
ARE ABLE TO PICK AND CHOOSE
SPECIFIC FEATURES THAT A PERSON
HAS INCLUDING HOW MUCH MONEY
THEY HAVE OR HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY
ARE IN THEIR CAREERS, IT IS MUCH
LESS LIKELY THAT SOMEONE WHO
DOESN'T HAVE A CAREER STARTED
YET WILL HAVE A CHANCE AT
FINDING LOVE WITH SOMEONE WHO
IS A LITTLE MORE ESTABLISHED.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN
INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE AND
WANTED TO OPEN IT UP TO
YOU GUYS.
IN FACT A LOT OF THESE APPS DO
NOT OPERATE IN AREAS THAT ARE
NOT CONSIDERED BIG CITIES SO Ã±
>>AS LONG AS YOU DON'T NEED ANY
PERSONAL SKILLS OR CONFIDENCE TO
APPROACH SOMEONE IN THE REAL
WORLD AND REALIZE I AM 100%
BEHIND ALL THESE APPS.
>> THERE ARE OTHER APPS THAT
BUILDS ITSELF AS THE BEST
MATCH AND DATING SERVICE FOR
MILLIONAIRES.
HALF OF ITS ACTIVE MEMBERS EARN
MORE THAN $500,000.
>>I'M FINE WITH IT.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO AGREE ON
WHO YOU WANT TO DATE.
AND IF YOU'RE RICH GO HAVE FUN
WITH EACH OTHER GO HAVE YOUR
SNOBBY
LITTLE BABIES AND BE
FINE WITH IT.
>> I WANT TO CONTINUE DISCUSSING
THIS IN OUR POSTGAME.
>>TYTNETWORK.COM/JOIN.
I ALSO HAVE A TON TO SAY ABOUT
THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE FOR
PEOPLE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR
CERTAIN EDUCATION LEVEL OR
OTHER THINGS.
WE WILL PICK IT UP IN THE
POSTGAME.
