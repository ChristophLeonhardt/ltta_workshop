1
00:00:05,201 --> 00:00:06,913
That’s a frog embryo,

2
00:00:06,913 --> 00:00:10,140
leaving its egg to 
enter the world,

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,226
and this embryo 
can hatch at will.

4
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:17,023
The red-eyed tree frog
lays its eggs on

5
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:19,563
a branch or leaf 
above the water.

6
00:00:19,563 --> 00:00:22,332
Once they’re in the last 
third of their development,

7
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:24,855
they can launch 
early if they need to.

8
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:28,931
If a wasp — or worse, 
a snake — attacks the eggs,

9
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:31,160
that movement 
signals danger.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,355
In seconds, the larvae can 
drop into the water

11
00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:36,795
and swim away.

12
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:40,133
It seems like they just push 
their way out of the egg,

13
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:43,894
but researchers at 
Boston University say no.

14
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:46,193
The scientists did 
several tests,

15
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:49,696
including poking the egg 
to simulate an attack.

16
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:52,733
They found that an embryo 
first sends out a burst of

17
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:55,718
enzymes from glands 
on its snout.

18
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:58,997
Those enzymes dissolve part 
of the egg’s membrane,

19
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:02,345
then the embryo 
wriggles its way out

20
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:04,924
and escapes from the snake.

21
00:01:04,924 --> 00:01:07,539
It’s a good defense:

22
00:01:07,539 --> 00:00:00,000
In case of attack — hatch!
