>>TRUMP HAS PROPOSED HIS LATEST
VERSION OF IMMIGRATION REFORM,
AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT EXTREME
REPUBLICANS, EXTREME
CONSERVATIVES, WON'T LOVE, AND
IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT THOSE
ON THE LEFT MIGHT NOT
NECESSARILY BE IN FAVOR OF.
LET
ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS, BUT
BEFORE I DO SO, JUST REMEMBER
THAT TRUMP'S INITIAL PROPOSAL
ASKED FOR ABOUT 2 BILLION IN
FUNDING FOR HIS BORDER WALL, HIS
LATEST PROPOSAL ASKS FOR 25
BILLION FOR HIS BORDER WALL.
WHAT HE'S DOING IS HOLDING THE
DREAMERS HOSTAGE, AND LETTING
THE DEMOCRATS KNOW THAT IF THEY
WANT PROTECTIONS FOR THESE
DREAMERS THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE
TO CONCEDE, AND KNOWING
DEMOCRATS THEY PROBABLY
LIKELY WILL DO SO.
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS --
>>HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE THESE
DREAMERS TO BECOME CITIZENS,
SHOULD THIS VERSION OF
IMMIGRATION REFORM PASS?
WELL --
>>NOW --
>>THERE HAVE BEEN ESTIMATES
INTO HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO
BUILD A WALL, AND EXPERTS SAY IT
WOULD COST ABOUT 19 TO 20
BILLION, SO THE EXTRA 5 BILLION
WOULD BE USED HIGHER MORE BORDER
PATROL AGENTS AND ALSO INCREASE
SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL
SECURITY ALONG THE BORDER.
ALSO
--
>>AND OF COURSE HE WANTS TO
SCRAP THE LOTTERY SYSTEM WHICH
ALLOWS PEOPLE FROM COUNTRIES
WITH LOW LEVELS OF U.S.
IMMIGRATION TO APPLY FOR VISAS.
>>I THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS
A COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE THING TO
NEGOTIATE ON.
YOU CAN NEGOTIATE
ON THE WALL, IT'S STUPID, IT
WON'T BE EFFECTIVE, THE BORDER
IS ALREADY VERY MILITARIZED, AND
YOU COULD SAY MAYBE IT'S JUST A
PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT, WHATEVER,
TRADE WALL NONSENSE FOR LIVES.
BUT THEY HAVE BASICALLY
INTEGRATED A COMPLETE WISH LIST
OF EVERY FAR RIGHT DEMAND ON
IMMIGRATION IMAGINABLE.
AND BY
THE WAY, THOSE STANDARDS, SPELL
THEM OUT IN THE FUTURE, THOSE
STANDARDS WILL BE INCREDIBLY
STRINGENT AND POTENTIALLY MUCH
MORE RUTHLESS THAN WHAT IS
CURRENTLY SPELLED OUT. AND THE
OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT
I DON'T THINK WE CAN FRAME THIS
IN TERMS OF RIGHT AND MORE
MODERATE INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY ANYMORE.
I KNOW I HIT THIS
THEME A LOT, BUT I THINK THEY
MADE THE CHOICE THAT BOTH
ELECTORALLY AND WITH THEIR BASE
AND ALSO STRATEGICALLY, THEY ARE
DOUBLING DOWN ON WHITE IDENTITY
POLITICS, AND THIS TYPE OF
POLICY IS RACIST, IT WORKS WITH
THE BASE, IT'S ALSO STRATEGIC.
WHY DO THEY WANT TEXAS TO LOOK
LIKE COLORADO?
WHY DON'T THEY
WANT A MORE DIVERSE SOCIETY?
I
HAVE TO SAY, ELECTIONS MATTER.
I
LOATHED HILLARY CLINTON BUT THIS
IS WHY YOU PULL THE LEVER
ON THAT TYPE OF VOTE.
>>YOU JUST PISSED OFF A BUNCH OF
PEOPLE.
>>IT'S UNDENIABLY TRUE.
>>IT'S REALITY.
>>I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAID IN
REGARD TO VOTING, I DISAGREE
WITH ONE SMALL PORTION AND IT'S
THE BASE AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT
SOME OF THESE ISSUES.
THE BASE
UNDENIABLY WANTS TO BUILD THAT
WALL, THEY WANT TO GET RID OF
SOME FORMS OF IMMIGRATION,
INCLUDING THE LOTTERY SYSTEM AND
SOME OF THESE VISA PROGRAMS.
BUT
IF YOU POLL TRUMP SUPPORTERS
SPECIFICALLY, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
A SLIM MAJORITY SUPPORT
PROTECTIONS FOR THESE DREAMERS.
>>AND THAT IS THERE.
BUT NOT THE
OTHER STUFF, THEY ARE GETTING
RID OF THE LOTTERY AND
EVERYTHING ELSE.
>>MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU
MEANT, BUT THE POINT THAT I WANT
TO MAKE IS, A SLIM MAJORITY OF
TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE IN FAVOR OF
PROVIDING PROTECTION FOR THESE
DREAMERS, AND AS A WHOLE IN THE
COUNTRY, THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS.
THE
MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY ONCE
PROTECTIONS.
THE DEMOCRATS WERE
IN SUCH A GREAT POSITION IN THE
SENATE TO SUPPORT, OR NOT
SUPPORT, BUT TO REALLY FIGHT THE
REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE ON
THIS.
TO CONTINUE SAYING NO, WE
AREN'T GOING TO AGREE TO FUND
THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL YOU GIVE US
WHAT WE WANT.
AND THEY CAVED
IMMEDIATELY, BASED ON WHAT?
A
PROMISE?
>>THEY
FAILED STRATEGICALLY AND MORALLY
AND THAT IS THE CONSTANT THING.
>>SO WHERE IS MCCONNELL NOW?
HE
MADE A PROMISE, RIGHT?
>>BUT HE COULD SAY HE
MADE THE PROMISE.
OR The PROMISE, HERE WE GO, IT'S
A VOTE ON DACA.
>>THIS IS WORSE THAN THE
ORIGINAL VERSION.
>>THAT'S WHY SENATE DEMOCRATS
SAYING IT'S OKAY, MCCONNELL MADE
US A PROMISE, IT'S PREPOSTEROUS.
THEY ARE EITHER THE STUPIDEST
PEOPLE ALIVE, AND THEY MIGHT AS
WELL SCREAM THEY ARE A VERY
STABLE GENIUS ON TWITTER, OR
THEY KNOW THEY DON'T SUPPORT YOU
AND THEY DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT
YOU.
THEY ARE LIKE, MITCH
MCCONNELL WILL LATER BRING UP A
BILL.
THAT BILL COULD BE
TERRIBLE, BUT HEY, WE DID OUR
JOB, OUR FUNDERS ARE HAPPY, THE
MARKETS ARE STABLE, REPUBLICANS
GOT WHAT THEY WANTED, GOLLY
GEE THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD
DO FOR YOU AGAIN, BUT VOTE
FOR US IN THE NEXT ELECTION,
MAYBE WE'LL DO SOME THING RIGHT.
>>I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS AN
IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY, THEY COULD
BRING DREAMERS TO THE STATE OF
THE UNION, THEY COULD CALL PRESS
CONFERENCES EVERY DAY TO TALK
ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AT
THESE ATTENTION CENTERS, THERE
IS A MUCH BROADER CRISIS IN
TERMS OF DEPORTATION, FAMILIES
BEING BROKEN APART, AND THE VIEW
IS DOING A MORE EFFECTIVE JOB OF
USING THE LEVERS OF POWER AND
MEDIA ACCESS TO HIGHLIGHT THESE
ISSUES, AND EVEN GUYS I LOVE
LIKE BERNIE, THAT'S MY MAN, HE
COULD DO A LOT MORE IN
TERMS OF JUST EVEN HIGHLIGHTING
THE PROCESS AND ABUSES.
THEY HAVE FAILED STRATEGICALLY
AND MORALLY.
>>IF I WERE IN THE SENATE I
WOULD BE IN THE MEDIA ALL DAY
EVERY DAY TALKING ABOUT THE FACT
THAT TRUMP PROMISED THAT MEXICO
WILL PAY FOR THAT WALL.
WHY ARE
U.S. TAXPAYERS SPENDING $25
BILLION ON A WALL TRUMP SAID
MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR?
THAT'S
MONEY THAT SHOULD BE USED ON
IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE, MONEY
TO HELP FUND OUR SCHOOLS, TO
CREATE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR
YOUR CHILDREN.
THEY ARE SO BAD
AT FRAMING.
>>IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE PAID TO
LOSE, THEY ARE DEEPLY CORRUPT.
SEND ALISON HARTSON TO THE
SENATE AND SEE WHAT SHE DOES,
SEND PROGRESSIVES, THEY WILL
FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL EVERY DAY.
IN TERMS OF CLARITY, LET'S BE
CLEAR, REPUBLICANS WHO SAID THEY
WERE AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
BECAUSE THEY ARE FOR THE RULE OF
LAW WERE LYING, AND THEY JUST
PROVED THAT THEY WERE LYING.
THEY ARE AGAINST ALL IMMIGRANTS.
THEY JUST SAID I WILL TAKE AWAY
THE VISA LOTTERY FOR LEGAL
IMMIGRANTS.
WHAT THEY ARE
CALLING CHAIN MIGRATION,
SPONSORING FAMILIES TO COME
HERE, IS THE HEART OF LEGAL
MIGRATION.
>>IT'S NOT CHAIN MIGRATION, IT'S
FAMILY REUNIONS.
>>IF YOU TAKE THAT AWAY YOU
ALMOST KILL OFF IMMIGRATION.
THAT'S THE HEART OF LEGAL
IMMIGRATION.
BY THE WAY, THERE
IS THE MUSLIM BAN, THAT SHOULD
BE CALLED THE FAMILY BAN.
THEY
ARE NOW PROPOSING A FAMILY BAN
BECAUSE WHY?
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE
WHO COME IN THROUGH THE FAMILY
SITUATION, WHERE YOU COME IN
LEGALLY, ARE COMING FROM ASIA
AND LATIN AMERICA AND THEY
DON'T WANT THOSE PEOPLE IN THE
COUNTRY.
>>AND
THEY DON'T WANT THEM VOTING,
IT'S A FEATURE, NOT A BUG.
>>AND YOU MIGHT SAY REMEMBER,
PEOPLE WERE ALSO AGAINST THE
IRISH AND THE ITALIAN, BUT THAT
WAS ALSO RACIAL.
THAT WAS WHITE
PROTESTANTS AT THE TIME WHO
DIDN'T WANT CATHOLICS IN THE
COUNTRY.
OR BIGOTED.
AND THEY
VIEWED THE IRISH AND ITALIANS AS
DIRTY, THEY DIDN'T WANT THEM IN
THE COUNTRY.
THEY DIDN'T WANT
JEWS IN THE COUNTRY, SAME THING.
AND IT WAS ALSO BASED ON
POVERTY.
BUT THINK ABOUT THAT
FOR A SECOND, IT'S THE SAME
ARGUMENT THEY MAKE NOW.
MEXICANS
COME HERE, THEY DON'T HAVE JOBS,
THEY ARE DIRT POOR, ETC., BUT
THAT'S HOW WE BUILT THIS
COUNTRY.
WE DIDN'T BRING IN
IRISH AND ITALIAN MILLIONAIRES,
WE BROUGHT PEOPLE WHO CAME IN A
BOAT BECAUSE THEY WERE STARVING.
IRISH, ITALIANS, JEWS, GERMANS,
FRENCH, YES THE LATINOS, YES THE
ASIANS, YES THE BLACKS, WHO
BUILT THIS COUNTRY.
AND I THINK
THE LOTTERY WAS A WONDERFUL
PROGRAM, I WAS PLEASANTLY
SURPRISED WHEN THEY INSTALLED
THAT -- LOOK, I GET THAT
REPUBLICANS HATE THAT EVEN MORE
BECAUSE IT'S A SLIGHTLY NEWER
PROGRAM, FAMILIES COMING HERE
AND SPONSORING THE REST OF THEIR
FAMILY IS WHAT WE'VE DONE
FOREVER IN IMMIGRATION IN
AMERICA.
BUT THE LOTTERY MAINLY
HELPS AFRICAN COUNTRIES.
AND THEY DON'T WANT THAT AT ALL.
>>BECAUSE THEY GET THOSE
ADVANCED DEGREES AND THOSE
HIGH-PAYING JOBS, WE DON'T WANT
ANY PART OF THAT.
>>THE NIGERIANS ARE A HUGE
PERCENTAGE OF HARVARD, YOU DON'T
KNOW THAT, IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOU
ARE PROBABLY GOING RIGHT, RIGHT,
BUT NIGERIANS HAVE
DISPROPORTIONATELY BEEN VERY
SUCCESSFUL IN HIGHER EDUCATION
IN AMERICA BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
THE PROPAGANDA THAT YOU HEAR ON
TV, SO ARE WE GOING TO SAY YES
TO KILLING OFF IMMIGRATION
OVERALL?
OF COURSE NOT. AND TO
ANA'S POINT, THE PREVIOUS
DEBATE, AND THIS IS HOW
REPUBLICANS MOVE THE GOALPOSTS
EVERY TIME, THE PREVIOUS DEBATE
WE JUST HAD LIKE FOUR DAYS AGO
WAS, DEMOCRATS WERE OFFERING
$1.6 BILLION FOR THE WALL AND
TRUMP WANTED MORE THAN TWO.
NOW
TRUMP SAYS IN RETURN FOR GIVING
YOU BACK THE HOSTAGES, THE
DREAMERS WHICH I TOOK HOSTAGE A
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, THEY WERE
FINE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, I
CHANGED IT SO I TOOK THEM
HOSTAGE AND I'M GOING TO THROW
THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY, IN
EXCHANGE FOR THAT I WOULD LIKE
BILLION FOR THE WALL AND I WOULD
LIKE TO KILL LEGAL IMMIGRATION.
>>AND I DON'T WANT TO QUICKLY
GO OVER WHAT YOU SAID, MICHAEL,
BECAUSE YOU MADE SUCH A GREAT
POINT THAT I THINK PEOPLE
FORGET, THERE IS A VERY SPECIFIC
REASON WHY THOSE ON THE RIGHT
WANT TO DO AWAY WITH LEGAL
MIGRATION.
YES, THERE IS A FORM
OF BIGOTRY BEHIND THE SCENES, A
FORM OF RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA
BEHIND THE SCENES, BUT I THINK
WHAT COMMENCES PEOPLE TO DO AWAY
WITH SO-CALLED CHAIN MIGRATION
AND ALL OF THIS, THEY DON'T WANT
THESE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR
DEMOCRATS AND THEY ARE VERY
TRANSPARENT ABOUT THAT.
RECENTLY
VICE DID A SPECIAL WHERE THEY
HAD A REPUBLICAN POLLSTER DO A
FOCUS GROUP WITH TRUMP VOTERS,
THEY WANTED TO SEE HOW THEY FEEL
ABOUT TRUMP'S FIRST YEAR IN
OFFICE.
THE MAJORITY WERE
SUPPORTIVE.
AND WHEN THEY WERE
TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION ONE
WOMAN SAID WE CAN'T KEEP
ALLOWING THESE PEOPLE TO COME
INTO THE COUNTRY, I'M
PARAPHRASING BY THE WAY, AND
VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS.
>>IT IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH VOTER
ID LAWS AND THE VOTING RIGHTS
ACT, AND THIS STUFF IS STRATEGY.
IT'S NOT JUST ETHICS, WE COULD
CONDEMN IT ETHICALLY BUT IT'S
ALSO STRATEGY.
THE SAME WAY THAT
WE NEED TO ACT ETHICALLY AND
ALSO STRATEGICALLY, BECAUSE A
MORE DIVERSE COUNTRY IS
ADVANTAGEOUS OR LEFT-WING
CANDIDATES.
>>THAT IS THE BIGGEST PART OF
THE NOVEMBER ELECTION, WAS
ALLOWING JEFF SESSIONS TO BE THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED
STATES, AND EMBOLDEN ALL OF
THESE GUYS WHO CLAIM VOTER FRAUD
AND ARE STRIKING PEOPLE FROM THE
ROLLS, AND MORE THAN THAT, THEY
ARE KEEPING PEOPLE AND THEIR
KIDS OFF THE ROLLS.
>>TERRORIZING PEOPLE.
>>WHAT WE DO LIKEWISE?
IF WE
THOUGHT THERE WAS A GROUP OF
IMMIGRANTS THAT WERE MORE LIKELY
TO VOTE REPUBLICAN, FOR EXAMPLE
FROM COUNTRIES THAT
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE RIGHT-WING
LEADERS.
THE PHILIPPINES --
>>THEY WOULD BE FLEEING THOSE
LEADERS BUT OKAY.
>>I THINK DUTERTE IS DOING SUCH
A GREAT JOB, I'M GOING TO
GO TO AMERICA.
>>I'M MAKING IT UP, PEOPLE
COMING FROM THE PHILIPPINES ARE
NOT NECESSARILY RIGHT WING, I'M
JUST PICKING COUNTRIES WITH
RIGHT-WING LEADERS.
INDIA HAS A
RIGHT WING LEADER, RUSSIA
OBVIOUSLY.
WOULD DEMOCRATS SAY
THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE
REPUBLICAN, OR PROGRESSIVES, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT DEMOCRATIC PARTY
LEADERS WOULD DO, WOULD
PROGRESSIVES SAY LET'S BAN
INDIANS AND FILIPINOS AND
RUSSIANS FROM ENTERING THE
COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY MIGHT VOTE
AGAINST US?
NO, BECAUSE WE ARE
MORE MORAL THAN THE RIGHT WING,
WHO ARE DEEPLY IMMORAL.
WHETHER
YOU THINK THAT IMMORALITY IS
BASED ON THEIR GREED FOR POWER,
AND A DEMOCRACY THOSE PEOPLE
MIGHT VOTE AGAINST US SO I WILL
KEEP THEM FROM THE AMERICAN
DREAM BECAUSE OF MY PERSONAL
LUST FOR POWER, WHETHER YOU
THINK IT'S BASED ON THAT OR
BASED ON OLD-SCHOOL RACISM, I
DON'T WANT PEOPLE FROM THOSE
COUNTRIES, OR ITS CLASSISM, I
DON'T WANT POOR PEOPLE IN THE
COUNTRY EVEN THOUGH THEY BUILT
THE COUNTRY FROM ALL THE
DIFFERENT RACES.
NONE OF IT IS A
MORAL STANCE.
THE MORAL STANCE
IS WE LOVE AND BELIEVE IN THE
CONCEPT OF AMERICA AND WE
BELIEVE IN WHAT THE STATUE OF
LIBERTY SAYS, THAT GREAT POEM ON
THAT STATUE STANDS FOR ALL OF
US, AND THAT NO MATTER WHO YOU
ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR WE WANT
YOU IN THIS COUNTRY IF YOU ARE
HUNGRY ENOUGH AND WANT TO WORK
HARD ENOUGH TO COME HERE
FOR A BETTER LIFE.
>>CENK, MORE THAN THAT, I'M
CONFIDENT IN MY BELIEFS.
I DON'T
FEEL LIKE I NEED TO RIG THE
SYSTEM TO MY ADVANTAGE.
I WANT
TO LIVE IN A FREE SOCIETY, FREE
MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS, AND NOT
HAVE TO RIG A SYSTEM OR RIG A
DEMOCRACY IN ORDER TO SUIT MY
AGENDA AND MEET MY AGENDA.
AND
THAT'S WHAT THE RIGHT WING DOES
TIME AND AGAIN.
>>WE WANT EVERYBODY TO VOTE AND
WE WANT IT TO BE AS EASY AS
POSSIBLE.
>>I WANT TO THANK CENK FOR THAT
AMAZING MONOLOGUE BECAUSE I WAS
JUST ABOUT TO SAY YES WE WOULD,
I'M GLAD YOU STOPPED ME.
THEY
WANT TO COME VOTE FOR
REPUBLICANS?
OF COURSE NOT.
