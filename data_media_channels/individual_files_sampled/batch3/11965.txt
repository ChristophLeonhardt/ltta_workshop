hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things were considered I'm Peter labelled a party divided in without a clear message Democrats face a fundamental dilemma move to the left and reach out to aggressives and in the process alienate its donor base or continue business as usual aren't the democrats tired of losing I was talking the Democrats I'm joined by my guess Lionel in New York he is a legal analyst in a news decoder at lionel mediacom in miami we have tim Canova he is a law professor as well as a candidate for the US House of Representatives in Florida's 23rd congressional district and in Los Angeles we have Ron black-owned he's a comedian a frequent guest on the Jimmy Dore show and The Young Turks as well as host of his own streaming show get your news on with Ron all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate Tim let me go to you because I think you you're going on a noble task in running for Congress as a Democrat here I'd like to start obviously you know as the kind of the Democrat Democrat on this program what is ailing the party the most we have Dianne Feinstein in California that the the party there I decided not to back her that's really quite interesting and then we have people like Pelosi that will never go away Schumer who will never go away and they can't be they can't take credit for any kind of policy victory electoral victory except for well people like to put money in their wallet is that really the litmus test to being a good Democrat today go ahead Tim well I like I'll tell you I do think that this is what is ailing the party is there's just too much corporate money and corporate influence in the party it gets in the way of Democrats legislating effectively when they are in power and it undercuts their support when they are running for office so I think the the influence of big money corporate money on the Democratic Party has been insidious and it seems like the party has two missions a primary mission and a secondary mission the primary mission is literally to prevent progressives from prevailing in primaries from being the Democratic candidates in November the secondary mission is to defeat Republicans in November if they can but it's only secondary the most important objective for the this party establishment is to make sure it remains a corporate dominated party and that unfortunately US policies across the board reflect those corporate agendas that's why we have run on the program here you know the Republicans love corporate money in Walsh so let's get that over with okay but we got wrong here and Ron is the progressive that's right Ron on the Jimmy Dore all the time I suggest our viewers do that fantastic stuff here and it's Ron as part of the cadre that will not let the corporate us continue as business as usual Ron in Los Angeles well you know III don't know how much I can do just as an individual but yeah I mean I think Tim summed it up perfectly they are driven by their donors and they use that donor money and and they're influenced by that and then it and then it kind of infiltrates the way they go about policy that they have this agenda where they have to remain donor friendly and they'll do the mental gymnastics necessary to not start talking about the issues people want to hear about because it disrupts their donors ie single-payer healthcare ie tuition free college a jobs program a green new deal the list goes on and on and on so with this donor friendly approach you know when people are given a choice between a Republican and a Republican typically they're just gonna go with the Republican and that's what we've been seeing a lot of and then when people run on unapologetically progressive platforms ie Lee Carter in Virginia they win even when they just ignore the establishment advice the Democratic establishment advice and then you know using another contemporary example over in Georgia you at John aschoff who had a very winnable district had an intense amount of money poured into his campaign and lost even worse than Hillary Clinton did because he ran on absolutely nothing and just had a bunch of empty platitudes so it's kind of obvious that there's a lot of unrest to miss people and that the status quo that the Democrats have tried out for so long is just not working anymore and well absolutely I mean since the what 2010 Democrats have lost a thousand seats across the country Barack Obama's most endearing legacy I would say Lionel you know speaking of Barack Obama you still have this this cadre at the top these elites here I mean I I don't even see them as Democrats I just see them is really it's just living corruption okay they're not policy driven they don't care about the middle class as a matter of fact they they approve the middle class and they go for everybody else that's why I'm really sick and tired of this identity politics they think it's gonna work it doesn't work okay it hasn't worked for eight years for the Democrats but they won't change lyonel it also known as fella on this program lionel go ahead there are no democrats they don't exist they're breathtakingly incoherent they're schizoid I don't know what they stand for Hillary Clinton was the worst infection this fetid feculent contamination of a once noble policy partly because there was something called liberalism in progressives what does she stand for she's the anti-trump and I Got News for you that the Republicans don't exist either this left/right illusion this paradigm is a joke so if you think that it's just Democrats it's not if you ask anybody ask anybody running for $25,000 in a new car what the hell do you stand for what are you about they can't tell you they talk about progressives and liberals that are look at Bernie Sanders yeah before they castrated them and remove this vertebra it's done it's finished it's over it's a joke this is theoretical nonsense like this is Ted Baxter media taking over we are divided into two parties in this country Trump and anti Trump that's it okay well Tim you know we're running for a Congress I mean yeah what is the disconnect between the constituents that you want to vote for you and the party that you represent I mean is there any overlap here because the more I look at the data what what people are actually interested in is just it's not mentioned in the media it's not mentioned by party leaders is there such a disconnect between the two go ahead - well you're right it is like a different conversation the party elites inside the beltway there's one conversation going on but in the district in my district and all around the country average people the ordinary citizen has far different concerns than what you hear when you turn on whatever cable show you're gonna watch whether it's MSNBC or Fox inside the beltway chatter you know folks have the same kind of problems everywhere around this country right now which is concerns about putting food on the table paying their bills their healthcare bills sending their kids to college if you're college kids it's it's a concern about your future and where you're gonna be even living you know 18 to 34 year olds are still more likely to be living with their folks with their parents then then on their own this is an it's an unforgiving economy you know the official unemployment rate is a real fantasy and people are really hurting and struggling and they want candidates and they want parties that are going to speak to their real needs and that is not happening at the at the level of the establishment you know the Nancy Pelosi's and Chuck Schumer's they really are beholden to the donor class people get elected to Congress and they're told if you want to be on a certain committee you've got to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for the party and the way to raise it is to call the CEOs who could contribute to you to be on a certain committee and this is a way that government gets captured by those special interests that sounds like corruption to me and just to reiterate let me let me get around here in LA in Los Angeles you know Ron explained to me because I really don't get it why it's like Stockholm Syndrome why can't they get away from Clinton and her clan her her because it seems to me that they're just they're obsessed with this here I mean there's someone that lost you know ran twice lost in the most embarrassing way to a reality TV show host okay but we still keep hearing from her and the her words continued to be echoed I mean just go away go ahead Ron yeah you know I'll be honest though this isn't a popular sentiment but I wanted to buy Hillary Clinton's book that was until I found out it wasn't a choose-your-own-adventure I thought had they gone that direction with it it would have been interesting you know like it would have been like to blame the DNC go to page 12 to blame Bernie for the third time go to page 26 you know for self-reflection you got to get a different book but I think they don't have any interest in doing that Peter I think that they I think Tim nailed their priorities Tim's absolutely right their first priority is to prevent a progressive takeover of the party which that's the one thing they're actually good at doing their second priority is maybe beating the Republicans and as Lionel pointed out which Lionel you're being like way too subtle here buddy you got it you got to be a little more aggressive but um but as I don't want it out the only message they really have is hey we're not Trump there are only messages hey we're not Trump and when you give people something like you have to give people something to vote for right when the only thing you give people is something to vote against like hey what do you stand for well we're not that other guy I wouldn't do that in comedy like no other job would people do that Leslie I wouldn't be like hey I'm a comedian oh what's your comedy like maybe I want to come see you well do you like carrot top I'm not a big carrot top fan well I'm not carrot top I'm totally not carrot top and now that was just the first comedian that popped into my head no that's not a good you know no one else does that or any other job you say what you're for exactly Lionel jump in there I mean but this hatred of Trump by the Democrats it seems to me that it is just bouncing the rubble I mean people have already decided one way or another they like the president they don't they have had for a long time okay I don't this the Democrats constantly going after his personality which I don't like sometimes okay but it's I'm interested in policy policy not personal attacks and that's all the Democrats have in their arsenal go ahead Lionel I'm gonna give them some advice and be because I'm I'm neither I'm a political and a political atheist and I I think it's just a joke but if I had to advise them pick three things very simple concepts I don't care what they are just picks thing and if you don't believe in it lie just tell people three simple things I'm going to make America safer I'm going to return jobs and health care I don't care more protein in your diet just say something because what have we heard so far up till now we have heard every single day that Hillary Clinton through what happened or as desi arnaz was a what happened she wrote a book basically is blaming now Russians and Bernie to an extent and we have spent with the complicity of and aided and abetted by this ted baxter stockman I have to go to a hard break and after that hard break we'll continue our discussion on the Democrat state with our tea welcome back to crosstalk where all things were considered I'm Peter LaBelle to remind you were discussing the Democrats okay Tim since I work in media and I have to cover with the media covers let's talk about Russia Russia Russia I mean how does that move forward the mainstream Democratic Party I mean that's all you hear about it's MSNBC is hard to watch for me it's unwatchable now because that's all you hear about and I'm not interested in that because no one has showed me any evidence whatsoever okay if there's evidence then let's talk about what it means but we don't have any evidence how does this rush a conspiracy story that the media are just so captivated with how does that move the Democratic Party forward after eight years of losing seats in huge numbers over the last ten eight years go ahead Tim in Miami again I think the Russian narrative if there's some evidence there it would be best if Congress had televised hearings in the American people could learn what actually happened but I think the whole rug the whole Russia conspiracy narrative puts things very out of proportion 90 million Americans didn't vote in the last presidential election those are the voters that Democrats have to be trying to re-engage and get them into the political process and the Russian narrative just is not going to do that I think it's a it's a failing strategy first of all when you take a look at what does the media concentrate on find they're concentrating a lot on that narrative what are they missing what are they not reporting on I can tell you just here in South Florida we had we wanted to verify the votes in our last election when I ran against debbie Wasserman Schultz in 2016 and we had to sue the Supervisor of Elections of Broward County while the lawsuit was pending they destroyed all of the ballots in our election and the media you know not a peep not a word about it so the media itself here has a lot of corporate priorities and it's to really drop him a lot of these establish Democrats and that's what makes it very frustrating and difficult I know your story why did they destroy those ballots they haven't given much of an adequate explanation and they destroyed those ballots in violation of federal law and they serve when they destroyed the balance they certified that the ballots were not the subject of a pending lawsuit and indeed they were I had sued the Supervisor of Elections to try to see these ballots so the whole idea that you need paper ballots to verify the vote they just ignore that they ignored federal law we're waiting to see what the consequences are we're demanding a federal investigation and calling on the governor to remove the supervisor of elections and meanwhile the democratic party establishment all throughout florida has been just amazingly quiet yeah I think that they would be concerned when ballots in a Democratic primary are destroyed okay well let me go to Ron I suppose it was some Russian bot that ordered the destruction of those ballots I mean given the media environment we live in that's a logical assumption to make go ahead Ron well you know I had no idea that 13 Twitter trolls were so effective and ever since I learned that I have been on Craigslist trying to hire a handful of folks to get me a Netflix special I figured if they can throw an election certainly they can help me out but but no I mean Tim I'm glad that that would Tim's been going through has gotten brought up because sadly that's not really a unique story within the Democratic establishment Tim's not the only person going through this kind of stuff you mentioned Nancy Pelosi her her opponent Stephen Jaffe kind of got mishandled by the establishment he's going through something similar not not ballot destruction but a similar corrupt for instance the nurses Association when they tried to give single-payer to the state of California the establishment found a way to hijack them this is sadly a very very common story and it's usually aimed at progressive so getting back to the topic kind of making it full circle here by hyper amplifying the Russian narrative 24/7 which is barely an embellishment of what the corporate media is doing by the way I mean there's been a Harvard studies done on this stuff they talk about it at a minimum about 75 percent of the time and most of the public is totally sick of hearing about it it avoids them from talking about what's really going on in the system and what's going on is that the system is rigged to the donor class we have one party and it's the money party and it's it's kind of beyond repair at this point you know Lionel it's interesting we look at Kim's experience there and what Ron just said there it just seems that the forces that threatened democracy are internal and it seems if we go from Bernie Sanders to Tim's case here you know it's systemic okay and and this is that this is what's really dangerous here I mean you know I've looked for on for a while now i watch his podcasts and all that you know and it's really refreshing to hear you know kind of a nuts and bolts you know straight-shooting progressive I mean I'm conservative but I I can listen to that there's a dialogue Ron and I can have a dialogue but in the media I never see that kind of dialogue and I never see Democrats and dialogue aid ever I mean change the subject pivot here pivot there never get a straight answer for them go ahead Lionel if you can't beat Debbie wasserman-schultz yeah if this cup can't beat debbie Wasserman Schultz if you even have to say anything if you don't say pressure on you to last time around one more time Jim go ahead yeah well nobody even knew who I was I said we ran ourselves we ran a great campaign last time nobody even knew who I was when I jumped into the race we ran for less than eight months 390 days before the election we were down 60 points in the polls and we almost took her at the finish line and who knows what the actual outcome was in light of the destruction of all these ballots we not sure that's a closed primary at the end of August we're only registered Democrats can vote yeah what not much of anything and you know I do think her days are very much numbered I think we're good well I suppose gentlemen I think Debbie can say I'm the most investigated Congress person in the current Congress I mean I think that might be true okay I mean I mean there's a special jail cell for her definitely really you know I'll send her oranges in Florida I gotta say I've gotta say this goes way be the problems go ahead and go ahead to the problems go way beyond debbie Wasserman Schultz and the problems go way beyond debbie Wasserman Schultz you know the system itself has so many problems just take a look at the present debates about the mass shootings at the schools you know most members of the House of Representatives are in safe districts because of gerrymandering they're either a safe Democrat or a safe Republican so it allows them to sing to the choir to their base without any real discussion between the parties you decried the fact that there's not real debate there's not real discussion to arrive at solutions anymore well you know a Republican can say the problem is all mental health and the Democrats can say it's only guns whereas the problem really is a bit of both and both need to be addressed and you take a look at what Capitol Hill is doing they don't hold legislative hearings on these or other issues because they're too busy spending 30 hours a week dialing for dollars calling up their donors and trying to raise money to run their campaigns this is not a legislative branch that legislates in any meaningful way anymore and it certainly is not representing the people of this country okay Ron you know I'm talking to Tim before the program you know he said he may be considering a running as an independent you know what isn't it really time for progressives to reach out to independents I mean why don't you just give up on the Democrats I mean it's just a swamp you know why don't you guys make that big move because it's I think the country needs it 90 million people didn't vote I wonder why okay and it's what that's a rhetorical question why doesn't it happen Ron I I mean I'm with you in the same in the same question really I mean I I was at the convergence conference where we presented Bernie Sanders with the signatures to start a new party I wish he would have done it but you know you run into questions of ballot access and stuff like that and just the whole restructuring of a party so I understand there's some complications I understand how some people are choosing Dementor as opposed to dem exit however you have to look at all the kind of roadblocks in our path everything from you know gerrymandering to super-delegates etc etc and you kind of think there's a lot of us there's a lot of us that kind of want the same things that kind of have some very big principles in common and if we all kind of somehow can mobilize we would be a real great political force to be reckoned with and you know hijacking the Democratic Party is a very long road it's not impossible starting a new viable party also long road but not impossible you know as an individual I'm more about just policies and movements myself I don't care what I think of your name but rather for the policies I'm for and you got the right principles but I'll give you a vote you know but I think that's in lionel well I think you know Ron's on to something because I well maybe it's just you know by accident you know I think that all of us here in just a far more interested in policy than personalities that weigh in on that line we'll go ahead I'm listening to this with all due respect this is the most insipid an exciting message there's too much of corporate money you know I'm came to the last but do you know how Trump won he beat everyone he came out like a bull a nut she comes he's got a message I'm agreeing with you Lionel he had a message personality he had personality and he didn't think that the message they'd read a message that the system was ready people yeah the system was rigged but you can't okay Lionel I I agree with you in many ways but you can't you can't govern that way that's the problem that's what I'm getting at here okay you can you can get elected that way but it's difficult yeah well we'll will that the jury's still out on that well you know what he's in and she's not so he did something right but let me tell you something all right I gotta jump I gotta jump in here run out of time fascinating discussion guys many thanks to Mike gets the New York Miami and in Los Angeles and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember crosstalk rules
