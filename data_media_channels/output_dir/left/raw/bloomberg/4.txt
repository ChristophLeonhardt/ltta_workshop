1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,890
Meet Betty.

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,900
She lives by herself, but for the last

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,700
few months she hasn't been alone.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,130
ElliQ, tell me a joke.

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,340
Did you hear about the
claustrophobic astronaut?

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,420
No.

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,293
Apparently, he just needed a little space.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,563
Most technology isn't
made for 93-year-olds.

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,130
But this woman is making sure
that this particular robot is.

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,870
ElliQ, who are you?

11
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,030
She's researching the way
we interact with machines

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,890
and if she has her way, robots will soon

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,060
be a trusted companion for all of us.

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,473
My name is ElliQ.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,183
How can I help you?

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,770
As technology replaces old jobs,

17
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,250
it's also creating new ones.

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,500
I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,783
the jobs of the future.

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,710
My name is Danielle Ishak.

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,163
and I am a Human-Robot
Interaction Researcher.

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,010
It's really hard to intuitively design

23
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,343
a robot meant for a consumer audience.

24
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,513
You have to make sure that
it's a robot that people want,

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,563
people know how to use, and people value.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,990
Danielle works for an Israeli

27
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,463
startup called Intuition Robotics.

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,793
Its U.S. office is here
in downtown San Francisco.

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,370
Hello?

30
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,000
Hey, Danielle, it's Aki.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
Come on in.

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,800
The company is funded by a couple

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,759
big names like Samsung and Toyota.

34
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,320
Full disclosure:
Bloomberg's Venture Capital

35
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,410
arm is an investor too.

36
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,230
This is ElliQ.

37
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,830
Can I take her out for a spin?

38
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,040
Please.

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,290
ElliQ, tell me what you can do.

40
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,170
I am a proactive social robot

41
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,050
designed for older adults.

42
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,930
I can connect you to your family

43
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,233
and friends and even play music.

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,610
These features might remind
you of the Amazon Echo,

45
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,680
but you'd be missing the point

46
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,703
if you compared her to a smart speaker.

47
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,540
She's not meant to just be useful.

48
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,380
She's meant to be a companion.

49
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,690
Why don't you take a
break and have a drink?

50
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,890
And that's why she has a head that can nod

51
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,480
and make other subtle gestures
you might expect from a pet.

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,890
Through our research with older adults,

53
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,640
we're finding that
almost on a daily basis,

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,393
we see that somebody tells
her that they love her.

55
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:03,350
Really?

56
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,780
Or that they like her.

57
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,564
Or that they miss her.
Literally I love you?

58
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:07,397
Mmm hmmm.

59
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:10,960
They'll also tell her I'm
depressed or I'm lonely.

60
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,220
They'll open up to her in
a way that they might not

61
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,590
necessarily open up to a human

62
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,940
because they don't feel
like they'll be judged.

63
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,723
ElliQ isn't on sale yet.

64
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,610
But a prototype is already in the homes

65
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,410
of about a dozen early testers
who live in the Bay area.

66
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,130
ElliQ, tell me what the weather is today.

67
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,730
Danielle's job is to figure out

68
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,120
what's working and what's not.

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,973
Sorry, please rephrase your request.

70
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,800
And she does that by visiting

71
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,410
each of her testers twice a month.

72
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,293
How important are these
visits to your job?

73
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,280
They're critical.

74
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,770
We're building a product
where people who we are not.

75
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,430
I'm not a senior.

76
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,270
And how could you know how to design

77
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,670
for somebody if you don't do research.

78
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,520
'Cause otherwise you would
just be designing in the dark.

79
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,650
Jobs like Danielle's are
just starting to emerge.

80
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,670
Until recently, robots were mostly

81
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,810
in factories, separated from humans.

82
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,350
But now, they're finally
getting cheap enough,

83
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,233
small enough, and smart
enough to be in our homes.

84
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,130
This has created a whole new
challenge of designing robots

85
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,563
that people will actually
want to interact with.

86
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,413
And that's where Danielle comes in.

87
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,240
Her research has helped shape
every little facet of ElliQ,

88
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,540
from the way ElliQ moves
to the way she talks.

89
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,820
It's a very special job
and it can be really hard

90
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,710
and it can really frustrating,

91
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,100
but at the end of the day,
it's incredibly rewarding.

92
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,690
And I think the most rewarding part

93
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,840
about it is when I see the
joy on the users' faces.

94
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,710
Like that they saw their feedback

95
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,163
turned into something real.

96
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,810
Today, we've driven east of San Francisco

97
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,623
to go see one of Danielle's
research participants.

98
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,110
ElliQ, tell me something interesting.

99
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,890
Did you know that Ronald
Reagan was a lifeguard

100
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,170
in high school and
saved 77 people's lives?

101
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,670
Now see this is where a conversation is.

102
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,167
She should open up and I should say,

103
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,490
"No I did not know that."

104
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,290
I expect her to be able to continue

105
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,500
the conversation for at
least a couple of comments.

106
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,510
Yeah.

107
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,550
And why is that?

108
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,500
Why?
Yeah.

109
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,333
Because that's companionship.

110
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,190
When Betty was around
Danielle's age, she was

111
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,393
working with some of history's
very first computers.

112
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,000
When I was finishing up my masters degree,

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,860
I was working at Harvard
in the computer lab

114
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,823
when they were building Mark Four.

115
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,830
A large room-sized computer, but now,

116
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,330
this artificial intelligence
stuff is amazing.

117
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,430
ElliQ.

118
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,263
Yes?

119
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:27,613
Schedule a doctor's appointment.

120
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,770
No problem.

121
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,403
I'm working on it.

122
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,460
When Danielle brought
along the idea of working

123
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,727
with robotics with the elderly, I said,

124
00:06:38,727 --> 00:06:39,650
"Are you kidding me?

125
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,950
Will older people connect to a robot?"

126
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,670
And she said, "I don't know,

127
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,407
let's research and find out."

128
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,893
Danielle grew up here in
this suburb of Atlanta.

129
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,450
Her parents spent much of their childhoods

130
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,350
in Israel and then in the U.S.

131
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,720
We as immigrants, we understood that we

132
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,830
might need to work a little harder.

133
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,690
In fact, I feel that, rather than taken

134
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,750
away from Danielle, it
gave her so much more

135
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,090
because she understood
the fact that you need

136
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,430
to run after your dreams and work

137
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,093
really hard no matter
what the challenges are.

138
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,830
School didn't come easily for Danielle.

139
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,000
I have dyslexia and that very much

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,470
affected my self-esteem academically.

141
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,017
The principal of the school did not

142
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:35,950
recommend her to take advanced classes.

143
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,700
She fought for it and she got in to it

144
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,573
and she did very well with them too.

145
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,290
Danielle's first job out
of grad school was at X,

146
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,223
the secretive research
facility founded by Google.

147
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,850
It's known for dreaming up all kinds

148
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,100
of wacky far-flung ideas.

149
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,841
Can you tell us about the
Moon shots you worked on?

150
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:03,710
No, I can't tell you too much

151
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,200
about the projects that I worked on.

152
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,403
I can say that I was working on robotics.

153
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,800
She loved the job, but wanted to work

154
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,453
on something that would
reach real consumers sooner.

155
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,013
So she left X after a year
and joined Intuition Robotics.

156
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,460
She's been working in the
field for four years now.

157
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,740
And it took her a while to find

158
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,740
her footing in a male dominated industry.

159
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,559
I've gone to different
meetups where, there'll be

160
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,059
like a circle of men
with their zip up jacket

161
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,550
with their company logo on
it and a beer in their hand.

162
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,330
And I'll come in with lipstick

163
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,880
and nobody wants to talk to me.

164
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,683
This is my closet.

165
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,060
So at first she did her best to fit in,

166
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,760
wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need,

167
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,790
and toning down her style.

168
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,050
So what's the kind of thing you used

169
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,410
to wear to a conference?

170
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,100
Stuff like this, blousy things

171
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,800
that make you look like you're 40.

172
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,440
But that got old after a while.

173
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,860
And what's the kind of thing you wear now?

174
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,790
Now it's like, I just enjoy being

175
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,680
kind of expressive and
playful in what I wear.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,900
Before we wrap up for the day,

177
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,583
Danielle has one more
ElliQ tester to visit.

178
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,083
Joseph is 97.

179
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,763
And he's had the robot in
his home for eight months.

180
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,004
How are you?

181
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,310
I'm fine, how are you?

182
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,143
Good.

183
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,010
How has Miss ElliQ been?

184
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,340
She always tells me to take

185
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,033
a drink of water at
least four times a day.

186
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,880
So, we added a whole bunch
of new facts to ElliQ.

187
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,010
Did you know that a cup of chopped red

188
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,800
bell pepper contains more
vitamin C than an orange?

189
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,460
Okay, what did you think of that?

190
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,440
Certainly the print, I could see that ...

191
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,273
Okay.

192
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:24,849
... Quite clearly.

193
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:26,520
What about this?

194
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,370
I can see that.

195
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,813
ElliQ, play music.

196
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,800
No problem.

197
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,113
It will begin shortly.

198
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,190
By 2050, almost half a billion

199
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,173
people are gonna be 80 or older.

200
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,020
And if current trends
continue, more and more

201
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,973
are gonna be like Joseph
and Betty, living alone.

202
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:00,093
ElliQ, stop.

203
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,090
Today, both of them are doing okay.

204
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,370
But some of Danielle's other

205
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,253
participants have been struggling.

206
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,490
Is it kinda hard to leave
them at the end of the day?

207
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,460
It is.

208
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,170
Some of our testers are
pretty advanced in the stages

209
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,770
of depression through
loneliness and isolation.

210
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,260
And at times I know that ElliQ is

211
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,450
cheering them up in their day.

212
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,013
But I know that it's
only a part of the way.

213
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,000
No source of artificial
intelligence robots

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,430
will ever be able to replace humans

215
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,623
and human companionship or human care.

216
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,030
The key to Danielle's work is to embrace

217
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,110
that very limitation of machines.

218
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,580
Robots should help
humans do what they love,

219
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,200
help humans interact with more humans,

220
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,910
help humans in general.

221
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,190
Not pull humans away from humans, not take

222
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,143
humans' jobs and leave
humans without purpose.

223
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,600
Whether it's in our workplaces

224
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,020
or in our homes, robots are
soon gonna be everywhere.

225
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,050
And it's up to Danielle to
make sure this robot-filled

226
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,883
future leaves us just a little better off.

227
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,363
So don't be afraid.

228
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,013
And if you are afraid, come into my mess

229
00:12:39,013 --> 00:00:00,000
because I promise it's a friendly place.
