1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:01,333
IMPLICATIONS.

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,634
BEN, THANK YOU, ALWAYS GOOD TO

3
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:03,369
SEE YOU.

4
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,269
>> THANKS A LOT.

5
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,237
>> Martha: BRENDA FOX PULLS

6
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:06,438
OUT TONIGHT THAT WE HAVE BEEN

7
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,374
POURING OVER COMMONLY GIVE US A

8
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,075
PICTURE OF HOW WOMEN IN THE

9
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:10,876
COUNTRY ARE FEELING ABOUT THE

10
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:11,343
KAVANAUGH VOTE.

11
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,380
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, TWO

12
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,750
DEMOCRATIC SWING VOTES, SARAH

13
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:18,450
McCASKILL AND HEIDI HEITKAMP

14
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,252
IN NORTH DAKOTA COULD SUFFER

15
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,154
AMONG WOMEN IF THEY VOTE NO ON

16
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:22,521
KAVANAUGH.

17
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,622
YOU CAN SEE A MAJORITY OF THE

18
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,690
WOMEN VOTERS AND THOSE TWO

19
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,025
STATES WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO

20
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:30,162
VOTE FOR THEM IF THEY REJECT

21
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:30,929
KAVANAUGH.

22
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:36,635
HERE NOW, KIMBERLY, A

23
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,337
SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVOR AND

24
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,004
DIRECTOR OF A MOVEMENT THAT

25
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:42,074
SUPPORTS THE CONFIRMATION OF

26
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,976
JUDGE KAVANAUGH PAIR THAT IS THE

27
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:44,943
FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU.

28
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:45,978
YOU ARE A SURVIVOR OF

29
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,312
SEXUAL ASSAULT, WE HAVE SEEN

30
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,313
THIS AS A BONDING EXERCISE AMONG

31
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,516
A LOT OF WOMEN WHO HAVE SUFFERED

32
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,084
SEXUAL ASSAULT WHO FEEL LIKE IT

33
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,218
IS FINALLY THEIR TURN TO STAND

34
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:53,752
UP AND BE HEARD.

35
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,155
WHY DO YOU NOT FEEL LIKE THAT,

36
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,057
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH

37
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:58,924
THIS YOURSELF?

38
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,293
>> I THINK THIS IDEA OF CREATING

39
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,361
THIS VICTIM MENTALITY IS

40
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,328
ACTUALLY HURTING OUR GIRLS.

41
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,730
I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO BE A

42
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,132
SURVIVOR AND A VICTOR.

43
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,534
YOU DON'T CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT

44
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:09,968
YOU ARE VICTIMIZED, BUT YOU DO

45
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,170
CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT YOU REMAIN

46
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:11,537
A VICTIM.

47
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,505
I WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE THAT TO

48
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,339
THE PERSON WHO HURT ME.

49
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,375
I WAS GOING TO BE THE VICTOR IN

50
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:16,675
THIS.

51
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:20,379
THEY CAN'T CONTROL ME.

52
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:20,746
YOU KNOW?

53
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,380
I AM THE VICTOR.

54
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,815
I THINK WHEN YOU TELL THAT TO

55
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:23,315
OUR GIRLS.

56
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,317
>> Martha: IT IS AN

57
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:25,951
INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE.

58
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,119
WHEN YOU WATCH DR. CHRISTINE

59
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,420
BLASEY FORD, DID YOU NOT FIND

60
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,988
HER CREDIBLE?

61
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,691
>> I THINK THE WORD CREDIBLE

62
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:33,592
NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED A

63
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,126
LITTLE MORE.

64
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,561
I THINK SHE WAS COMPELLING

65
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,195
PAIRED SHE WAS DEFINITELY

66
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:36,595
COMPELLING.

67
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,964
AND I DO BELIEVE THERE IS

68
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:39,665
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT SHE

69
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,634
FEELS THAT HAPPENED, AND IT

70
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:43,368
PROBABLY -- SOMETHING PROBABLY

71
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,369
DID HAPPEN TO HER.

72
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,405
BUT THE IDEA THAT SHE COULD SAY

73
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,408
100% THAT SHE KNEW WHO IT WAS,

74
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,175
BUT SHE COULDN'T ANSWER A LOT OF

75
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,544
THE OTHER QUESTIONS, I THINK

76
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:53,645
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE

77
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,414
NEED TO START TALKING ABOUT, THE

78
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,115
IDEA THAT WOMEN NEVER LIE AND

79
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,117
MEN ALWAYS DO.

80
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,286
THAT SETS UP OUR MEN AND OUR

81
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,054
SONS FOR SOME DISASTROUS EFFECTS

82
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:02,955
IN THE FUTURE.

83
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,689
I KNOW I AM HEARING FROM OTHERS

84
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,125
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WHO ARE UP

85
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,426
IN ARMS OVER THIS, AND THEY JUST

86
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,828
WANTED TO STOP.

87
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,830
GET THIS CONFIRMATION TO MOVE

88
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:12,331
FORWARD.

89
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,098
>> Martha: BUT YOU HEARD

90
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,366
ALYSSA MILANO, I DON'T KNOW IF

91
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,301
YOU HEARD THAT SOUND BY JUST A

92
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,302
MOMENT AGO.

93
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:17,936
>> I DID.

94
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,505
>> Martha: SHE IS SAYING TOO

95
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:19,771
BAD.

96
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,939
WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAVE BEEN

97
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,673
SUFFERING IN THESE CASES FOR SO

98
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,143
LONG, AND OF MEN FEEL A LITTLE

99
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,244
BIT BEATEN UP RIGHT NOW, THAT IS

100
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,312
TOO BAD.

101
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:27,946
THE PENDULUM HAS TO SWING.

102
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:31,517
>> IT ACTUALLY HURTS WOMEN.

103
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,317
I WISH THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND

104
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:32,618
THIS.

105
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,186
WHAT THEY ARE DOING BY

106
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,856
MARGINALIZING AN ACTIVE ASSAULT

107
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,192
OR VIOLENCE AGAINST A WOMAN

108
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,394
AND TURNING IT INTO A POLITICAL

109
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,062
WEAPON, IT DIMINISHES THE VOICE

110
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,264
OF EVERY WOMAN MAY BE ASSAULTED

111
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:49,168
OR HAVE VIOLENCE -- OR MY CASE,

112
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,438
WHERE YOU WERE MOLESTED AND NO

113
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,006
ONE WILL BELIEVE YOU.

114
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,574
HOW COULD THEY WHEN THEY TURN IT

115
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,241
INTO A POLITICAL WEAPON?

116
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,109
AND HOW CAN YOU SAY YOU CARE

117
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,644
ABOUT WOMEN WHEN YOU ARE WILLING

118
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,111
TO DO THAT?

119
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,779
THE WOMEN THAT I TALK TO, I KEPT

120
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,550
ASKING THEM, THE WOMEN WHO WERE

121
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,951
WITH THEIR "BELIEVE WOMEN"

122
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,186
SHIRTS, WHAT IF IT IS NOT TRUE?

123
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,321
WHAT IF HE DIDN'T DO IT?

124
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,322
>> Martha: WHAT DID THEY SAY

125
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:10,656
TO YOU?

126
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,125
>> THEY SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER.

127
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,059
>> Martha: THAT IS REALLY

128
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,459
FRIGHTENING.

129
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,230
SO THE MESSAGE IS WE DON'T MIND

130
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,598
TAKING DOWN INNOCENT GUYS IF IT

131
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,966
SERVES THE LARGER CAUSE?

132
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,734
>> THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MESSAGE.

133
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,536
>> Martha: INCREDIBLE.

134
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,237
SCARY, ISN'T IT?

135
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,471
AND YOU HAVE A MARCH.

136
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,140
TELL US QUICKLY ABOUT THAT.

137
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,242
>> WE HAD A CONFERENCE TODAY,

138
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,810
AND WE ARE LAUNCHING A MOM'S

139
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,912
MARCH, OUR SECOND ABDUL MOM'S

140
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,315
MARCH THAT WE ARE HOLDING MY

141
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,350
COASTING IN SAN ANTONIO.

142
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,119
THE REASON WHY IS WE WANT IN

143
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,554
ALTERNATIVE VOICE TO THESE

144
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,589
RADICAL FEMINISTS WHO ARE TRYING

145
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,990
TO DEMORALIZE OUR MEN, DEMONIZE

146
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,491
THEM HERE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

147
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,995
SAY NO, WE LOVE MEN.

148
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,997
THERE IS EVIL IN THE WORLD, BUT

149
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,732
IT IS NOT ALL MEN.

150
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,702
THE IDEA THAT WHITE MEN ARE THE

151
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,703
ENEMY OF EVERY PERSON, EVERY

152
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,270
WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY.

153
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,571
WE WANT TO TURN THAT AROUND.

154
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,272
THAT IS WHAT THIS MOVEMENT IS

155
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,707
ALL ABOUT.

156
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,641
WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARD.

157
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,910
WE ARE RALLYING.

158
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,944
MAMA BEAR HAS BEEN POKED, AND

159
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,146
THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME

160
00:04:08,147 --> 00:00:00,000
CHANGES IN THE CONVERSATION.
