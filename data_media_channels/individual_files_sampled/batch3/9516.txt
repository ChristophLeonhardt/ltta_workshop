DON'T WANT THINGS TO OVERHEAT. Dana: SO GLAD YOU WERE HERE. CONNELL McSHANE, EVERYBODY. NIGHT PRODUCING INTERESTING OUTCOMES IN MAINE. VOTERS REFUSE TO DELAY RANKED CHOICE VOTING THE CONTROVERSIAL SYSTEM USED THERE. VOTERS IN NOVEMBER WILL GET TO RANK CANDIDATES IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE INSTEAD OF JUST CHOOSING ONE. PLUS A BIT OF AN UPSET IN SOUTH CAROLINA WHERE INCUMBENT CONGRESSMAN MARK SANFORD LOST HIS PRIMARY HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED SUPPORT FOR HIS G.O.P. CHALLENGER KATIE ARRINGTON. JOSH HOLMES IS A FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO MITCH MCCONNELL AND ADRIENNE ELROD IS FORMER DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR HILLARY CLINTON. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BOTH HERE. THANKS, DANA. Dana: JOSH, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS THOUGH, ALL OF THAT NEWS IS HAPPENING AND THIS POLL OUT TODAY FROM SUFFOLK UNIVERSITY IN THE OHIO SENATE RACE WITH SHERROD BROWN THE INCUMBENT SENATOR AT 53.4%. JIM RENEE'SY THE CHALLENGER A HOUSE MEMBER RIGHT NOW ONLY AT 36.6%. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT RENACCI HAD TOLD MITCH MCCONNELL AND OHIO COULD BE AN ACTUAL REPUBLICAN PICKUP. HOW IS THAT LOOKING RIGHT NOW. LOOK, IT'S A COMPETITIVE STATE. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A COMPETITIVE STATE. WE ARE AT THE STAGE OF THE SENATE RACE IN OHIO. JUST THROUGH THE PRIMARIES, GOT TON PINT WHERE THAT ELECTORATE HASN'T REDEFINED ITSELF. I THINK WHEN YOU SEE TRUMP VOTERS COME HOME AND SUPPORT THE REPUBLICAN TICKET, THAT'S GOING TO TIGHTEN UP PRETTY CONSIDERABLY WHERE IT'S CURRENTLY AT. Dana: ADRIENNE WHEN YOU LOOK AT PRIMARY RESULTS KATIE ARRINGTON WINNING AGAINST MARK SANFORD IN THAT PRIMARY. BECAUSE SHE SAID HE WAS NOT SUPPORTIVE ENOUGH OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. LISTEN TO SENATOR BOB CORKER ON WHAT HE SAID ABOUT REPUBLICAN SENATORS BEING KIND OF SCARED OF THE PRESIDENT. THE UNITED STATES SENATE RIGHT NOW ON JUNE THE 12TH IS BECOMING A BODY WHERE WE WILL DO WHEN WE CAN DO. NOT DO ANYTHING THAT MIGHT UPSET THE PRESIDENT. Dana: I FEEL THIS IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IF YOU GO BACK TO 2010 AND THINKING ABOUT DEMOCRATS WHO WERE WEARY OF, YOU KNOW, UPSETTING THE POPULAR PRESIDENT AT THAT TIME, BARACK OBAMA. YEAH. WELL, I THINK WHAT YOU ARE ALSO SEEING HERE IS THAT THERE IS SIMPLY NOT ROOM FOR MODERATE REPUBLICANS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I MEAN, LOOK AT MARK SANFORD LAST NIGHT IN SOUTH CAROLINA. SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN WHO HAS GOVERNED MODERATELY BUT ALSO SPOKEN OUT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP. YOU ARE SEEING MORE MODERATE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE LOSING THEIR PRIMARIES TO VERY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS WHO TRUMP ENDORSES. NOT ALWAYS HAPPENING BUT BEEN HAPPENING QUITE A BIT. I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS A LOT OF SOUL-SEARCHING TO DECIDE ARE WE GOING TO BE THE PARTY OF TRUMP OR ARE WE GOING TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GOVERN MODERATELY AND REPRESENT MODERATE REPUBLICANS. Dana: JOSH, YOU THINK THIS IS A NO-BRAINER, THE PRESIDENT IS SUPER POPULAR WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND SO THIS IS THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE. WOULD YOU SAY MODERATE DEMOCRATS ARE ENDANGERED SPECIES AS WELL. MORNING SANFORD IS NO MODERATE. EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE GOVERNOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. I THINK THE PROBLEM IS VOTERS DON'T HAVE ANY PATIENCE FOR THOSE WHO MAKE ANTI-TRUMP SORT OF THEIR IDENTITY. THEY WANT REPUBLICANS TO PICK UP THEIR LUNCH PAIL AND GO TO WORK AND TRY TO GET THIS AGENDA DONE. OF COURSE, SANFORD SPENT INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME CRITICIZING THE PRESIDENT. I DON'T THINK VOTERS HAVE ANY PATIENCE FOR THAT AT THIS POINT. Dana: ADRIENNE, LET ME ALSO ASK YOU SOMETHING ABOUT SOMETHING DEMOCRATS ARE PROUD OF. THEY HAVE SOME NUMBERS THEY CAN POINT TO. NUMBER OF WOMEN CANDIDATES WHO ARE RUNNING FOR THE AS A PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THEY ARE WINNING BIG TIME. COOK POLITICAL REPORTS DAVID WASSERMAN TWEET YOU HAD, THIS REMARKABLE. AFTER TONIGHT, DEMS HAVE NOMINATED WOMEN IN 73 OUT OF 150, THAT'S 49% OF HOUSE RACES, EXCLUDING DEM INCUMBENTS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. 16%. 18 OUT OF 112. DO YOU THINK THOSE WOMEN WILL ULTIMATELY WIN IN THE GENERAL ELECTION AS WELL? YEAH, I DO, DANA. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME TALK ABOUT MY VERY FAVORITE TOPIC TO TALK ABOUT WHICH SAUL THE WOMEN WHO ARE WINNING AT RECORD AMOUNTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. IF A WOMAN IS RUNNING AGAINST A MAN OR SEVERAL MEN IN A PRIMARY ON THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SIDE, THE CHANCES OF HER WINNING ARE SOMETHING I THINK AROUND 90%, 92% AT THIS STAGE OF THE CYCLE. EMILY'S LIST, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE EVER THE PRIMARY ORGANIZATIONS THAT HELPS RECRUIT WOMEN TO RUN FOR HIGHER OFFICE, 36,000 WOMEN HAVE CONTACTED EMILY'S LIST THIS CYCLE WITH INTEREST IN RUNNING FOR OFFICE. SOMETHING LIKE 950 IN 2016. SO IT JUST SHOWS THAT WOMEN ARE FIRED UP. THEY WANT TO TAKE BACK THEIR COUNTRY. THEY REALIZE THE ONLY WAY WE CAN REALLY HAVE AN IMPACT IS TO GET INVOLVED. A LOT OF THEM ARE GETTING INVOLVED BY RUNNING FOR CONGRESS OR RUNNING FOR ANY OFFICE. IT'S REALLY MAKING A HUGE DIFFERENCE. Dana: JOSH, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS I HAD STEVE STIVERS ON, HE IS THE NRCC CHAIRMAN THIS YEAR. THEY DO HAVE BETTER NUMBERS THAN THEY HAVE HAD IN THE PAST. YOUR THOUGHTS? WELL, LOOK, CAN I NAME TWO MORE WOMEN CANDIDATES THAT ARE GOING TO BE WINNING ARIZONA WITH MARTHA MCSALLY A GREAT CANDIDATE FOR SENATE DOWN THERE. SHE IS DEFINITELY GOING TO WIN AND MARSHA BLACKBURN IN TENNESSEE. I AGREE WITH ADRIENNE IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT YEAR FOR WOMEN. NOT JUST A GREAT YEAR FOR LIBERAL WOMEN. IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT YEAR FOR WOMEN ACROSS THE BOARD AND I THINK REPUBLICANS ARE EXCITED ABOUT THAT, TOO. Dana: LET ME ASK YOU ONE LAST QUESTION. I WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE EACH. PAUL RYAN ANNOUNCED THAT NEXT WEEK THERE IS GOING TO BE VOTES ON TWO IMMIGRATION BILLS. DEALING WITH DACA, THE DREAMERS, AND BORDER SECURITY. AND THIS IS AS MCCLATCHEY IS REPORTING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS LOOK TO ERECT TENT CITY TO HOUSE UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS AS THEY ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY. JOSH, I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I DO THINK BECAUSE THAT ISSUE IS GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION, PEOPLE FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT IT AND POINTS ON BOTH SIDES. IS THAT GOING TO FUEL A LOT MORE INTEREST IN THESE IMMIGRATION BILLS NEXT WEEK? WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE. SO AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT SPEAKER RYAN IS TRYING TO DO IS GET TO AN OUTCOME HERE AND WHAT WE SEE TOO MUCH OF LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS PARTICULARLY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE THEY WANT THE ISSUE. THEY DON'T WANT IT RESOLVED. AND, WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME OUT AND MADE SOME ACCOMMODATIONS TO SAY, YOU KNOW, WE WILL GO AHEAD AND DO DACA IF WE CAN ALSO BUILD THE WALL, HAVE SOME BORDER SECURITY AND DO SOME MODEST REFRAMING OF THE OF CHAIN MIGRATION, DEMOCRATS SAID NO. AND SO, YOU KNOW, MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN GET BEYOND THAT SORT OF PARTISAN CORNERS OUTLOOK OF THIS AND ACTUALLY GET TO A SOLUTION HERE. Dana: ADRIENNE, DO YOU THINK NEXT WEEK IF THE LEGISLATION LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT MAYBE TAKE AWAY THE POLITICAL TOOL THAT THE DEMOCRATS WOULD WANT TO USE IN THE FALL THAT THAT WOULD BE WORTH IT? LOOK, I'M GOING TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MY FRIEND JOSH HERE. DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS DEBATE THAT WE WILL COME TO THE TABLE. WE WILL NEGOTIATE ON THIS. YOU ACTUALLY JUST SAID, JOSH, THAT WE WOULD ALLOW FOR BORDER SECURITY FUNDING. SOME SORT OF FUNDING FOR THE WALL IN ORDER TO CREATE A PATH OF CITIZENSHIP FOR DREAMERS. SO, YOU KNOW, THE REAL LOSER HERE ARE THE DREAMERS. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN LIMBO IN THIS COUNTRY WHO DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE DEPORTED OR NOT. I DO HOPE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS CAN COME TOGETHER AND FIND A SOLUTION. DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR ALL ALONG WE'RE WILLING TO PLAY BALL. WE WANT TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE. LET'S NOT FORGET DEMOCRATS SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT OVER THIS ISSUE IN FEBRUARY. Dana: THAT'S TRUE. GET A COMPROMISE. Dana: CHANCE TO VOTE ON IT NEXT WEEK IN THE HOUSE. WE YOU HAVE COME BACK, JOSH, AND TELL US WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL PLANS TO DO WITH THAT IN THE SENATE WHICH
