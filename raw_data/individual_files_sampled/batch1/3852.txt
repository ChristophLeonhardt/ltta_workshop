oftentimes people may oh I'm gonna go get a bottle of champagne and they're gonna spend maybe $50 here is your max budget and you can get some decent things but really you're just giving them the word champagne and beyond that we really don't know much about what's in that bottle I think it's always fun to bring large bottles of wines to parties magnums are larger and more humble areas like Beaujolais or basic levels of German Riesling even kind of just regular bull GaN Rouge or red Burgundy so if you walk into a wine shop and you see a Magna Beaujolais on the Shelf it's probably only fifty or sixty bucks and it's going to be delicious I think often times we overlook desert wine we overlook fortified wines and I think those are really great if you're having a dinner party to bring something else out with cheese or dessert I'm a big fan of Madeira which is a fortified wine in Portugal island off the coast of Portugal and we know it as a cooking wine but really a fun bottle of Madeira is great with any food it's nutty and caramely there's a range of sweetnesses to them and they have bright acidity and you can usually find an entry-level bottle of Madeira for a really great price
