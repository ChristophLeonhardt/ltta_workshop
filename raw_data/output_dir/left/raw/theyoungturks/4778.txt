1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,579
TODAY THE SENATE PASSED A

2
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:02,980
NEW SET OF SANCTIONS ON BOTH

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,980
RUSSIA AND IRAN.

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,589
LET'S TALK
ABOUT SOME OF THESE NEW

5
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,409
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA.

6
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:35,110
THIS IS
FROM THE PRESS BRIEFING BY THE

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:50,140
WAY.

8
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,780
THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT NEW
SETS OF SANCTIONS.

9
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,780
WE ARE

10
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,339
RUNNING LOW ON TIME, BUT WHAT IS
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS BILL

11
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:05,480
WHICH JUST PASSED IS NOT THE NEW
SANCTIONS, BUT THE NEW OVERSIGHT

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,080
THAT CONGRESS IS GOING TO HAVE
OVER THE CONTINUANCE OF THE

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,540
SANCTIONS.

14
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,220
A 
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

15
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,760
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT AFFECT SOME

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,050
SORT OF DEAL INVOLVING THE

17
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:34,530
EASING OF SANCTIONS MIGHT'VE
HAPPENED DURING THE ELECTION.

18
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,540
WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM
DIPLOMATS IN THE STATE

19
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,460
DEPARTMENT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN
TIMES THEY HAVE TRIED TO PUT

20
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,760
PRESSURE ON THE STATE DEPARTMENT
TO INDEPENDENTLY CALL FOR THE

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,410
SANCTIONS TO BE ERASED.

22
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,510
CONGRESS
IS SAYING THEY WANT TO BE A PART

23
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,510
OF THAT.

24
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:54,140
IF HE TRIES TO DO THAT IN THE
FUTURE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

25
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,140
STOP IT THEORETICALLY.

26
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:05,620
HER TO VETO A BILL THAT PASSED
THE SENATE 97 TO 2.

27
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,710
IN REFERENCE TO WHAT I WAS
JUST SAYING ñ CHUCK SCHUMER

28
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,610
DESCRIBING THIS NEW SET OF

29
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:26,300
OVERSIGHT RULES SAYS THIS.

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,670
AND
SO ORIGINALLY THEY HAD A SET OF

31
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,810
SANCTIONS ON IRAN THAT WAS GOING

32
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,420
TO BE PUT INTO EFFECT.

33
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,380
THERE
WERE TWO VOTES AGAINST THAT.

34
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,890
THEN YOU HAVE THE FINAL SET OF
SANCTIONS ON BOTH RUSSIA AND

35
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,360
IRAN, TWO PEOPLE VOTED AGAINST
THAT.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,790
RAND PAUL VOTED AGAINST

37
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,720
IT, THE OTHER ROW, BERNIE
SANDERS.

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,930
SO WHY WAS THAT?

39
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,930
WE

40
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,920
HAVE HIS STATEMENT, REMEMBER
THIS IS SANCTIONS ON BOTH

41
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,000
RUSSIA AND IRAN.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,430
HERE IS WHAT HE SAID.

43
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,620
TOGETHER OR SEPARATE?

44
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,540
TOGETHER IN ONE PACKAGE.

45
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:29,710
BERNIE SANDERS SAID THIS.

46
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,390
REFERRING TO THE NUCLEAR TRADE A

47
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,770
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

48
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,630
I BELIEVE
THESE NEW SANCTIONS COULD

49
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,739
ENDANGER THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS
SIGNED BETWEEN THE US, ITS

50
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:41,020
PARTNERS AND IRAN IN 2015.

51
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,880
THAT
IS NOT A RISK WORTH TAKING.

52
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
HE

53
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,880
APPARENTLY SUPPORTS THE RUSSIA
SET OF SANCTIONS, BUT HE

54
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,270
BELIEVES THAT PUTTING THESE NEW

55
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,890
SANCTIONS ON IRAN COULD CAUSE
THEM TO FEEL LIKE STAYING IN

56
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,270
THAT TREE IS NOT WORTH IT
ANYMORE.

57
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,270
AND IF THEY WERE TO

58
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,709
BACK OUT THEY COULD RESUME THEIR
EFFORTS TO BUILD BALLISTIC

59
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:06,160
MISSILE TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

60
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,310
THIS WON'T PASS THE HOUSE.

61
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,610
THERE IS NO WAY THAT DONALD

62
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:25,960
TRUMP DOESN'T ARGUE THAT THIS
UNDERMINES EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY.

63
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,180
HE CAN PROBABLY GET THE SENATE

64
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,870
TO VOTE ON THE IRAN PART
SEPARATELY IF HE NEEDED TO.

65
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,900
BUT

66
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,020
DEMOCRATS WILL TRY AND PUT THEM
TOGETHER OBVIOUSLY.

67
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,020
THE WHOLE

68
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,600
WAY YOU WIN THIS BATTLE IS
POLITICALLY.

69
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
BUT NOW THERE IS A

70
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,440
97 TO 2 VOTE ON RECORD.

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:05:03,160
WHICH
YOU PROBABLY WON'T SEE ANOTHER.

72
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,830
I DON'T KNOW ñ INDICATION HAS
COME OUT FROM A SPOKESPERSON FOR

73
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,400
PAUL RYAN SAYING THAT HE WAS A
VOCAL PROPONENT FOR THE LAST

74
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,751
GROUP OF SANCTIONS, BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE COULD NOT

75
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:17,930
DO WHAT YOU ARE ALLUDING TO.

76
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,310
THAT HAS TO PASS THE HOUSE.

77
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,080
INTERESTINGLY TODAY JOHN KERRY
PUT OUT A STATEMENT ECHOING MUCH

78
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,030
OF WHAT BERNIE SANDERS SAID
ABOUT THE IRAN PORTION.

79
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,030
SAYING

80
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,680
THIS WOULD RISK IRAN PULLING OUT
OF THAT TREATY WHICH IS

81
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
DANGEROUS FOR A NUMBER OF

82
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,470
DIFFERENT REASONS.

83
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,540
THAT IS ONE
THING TO CONSIDER.

84
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,540
WE ARE STILL

85
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,070
EARLY IN THE PROCESS, WE WANTED

86
00:05:40,070 --> 00:00:00,000
TO GET YOU UPDATED.
