today we have the great privilege of being joined by the incomparable and iconoclastic Blair White to discuss what the left gets wrong on transgenderism the problems with LGBT activism and which pronouns we should all be using then Arielle Davidson and amber Athey joined the panel of deplorable x' to talk M&Ms terrible rap performance but I repeat myself fat kids and how the Boy Scouts have officially become the Girl Scouts I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show Blair thank you for coming today we have you in studio which is excellent now this is a total coincidence but it's probably just providential today we booked you just for today we didn't realize it it is international you know it's National Coming Out Day and International Day of the girl that is it that is a tremendous coincidence well it's a good thing you brought the girl that we brought the girl we have the girl in studio now for those of you who don't know Blair I would be surprised if anybody doesn't know Blair at this point but check out this video it's my view however that while the truth can be harsh it can't be bigoted and I don't know maybe it's just me but I've never had a problem swallowing the truth and I actually think there's a power in recognizing the truth because it'll set you free and such transgenderism is a mental disorder so aside from that there is a tiny portion of the population that are transsexuals such as yours truly I'm a biological male who was born that way and will die that way however as my luck would only have it mother nature kind of to me and gave me the inclinations of a female there's been a number of studies that have shown that male to female transsexual have similar brain structures and activity to that of biological women because of that I decided to take it upon myself to seek off the help of medicine to transition or physically resemble the body of a woman to the best of my ability so in any sense other than legally I guess this doesn't mean that I changed my sex this doesn't mean that I am an invented new sex it simply means that I personally found it necessary to live as and resemble the opposite sex in the pursuit of my own happiness you just I don't know if you could hear that I you just made the computers of every lefty who watches this show explode they just exploded their houses are on fire I'm actually only kidding because no lefties watch my show you are you are like a voice of reason on this whole issue you yourself or transgender you but you're not insisting that there's a third gender or a fifth gender or at two hundred and fiftieth gender you're not suggesting that you've become metaphysically a woman but you know you do resemble a woman obviously you don't look like a man therefore it follows naturally that you would be shunned by the online transgender community absolutely you know I try to take at least in my eye it's a realistic approach to describing transgenderism the experience of being trans etc and all the trans activists of course hate me LGBT activist in general I often call myself like the black sheep of the trans community why do they actually saw in Twitter someone said there are like seven kinds of trans people you were your own category yeah there are like right wing left wing what why do they resist you why do they why are they so offended when you say things that are obviously true that are common sense you know I just think there's a particular narrative that is acceptable at this point in time and anything else you know diverging from that is just hate it hate facts as they call them yeah absolutely you know the whole topic of you know trans being a mental disorder that's literally just a fact it's just a venitian yeah it is if you want to be more precise gender dysphoria is but transgenderism is the state of having gender dysphoria so for me it's kind of like I don't know why that's such a an inflammatory statement because people have all kinds of disorders people have anxiety depression you know OCD OCD autism everything so I've never understood why it's so I'm terrible to say that or admit that but and just say that I'm I'm a man I was born a man I've the body of a man but there's something in my psyche that makes me think that I'm a woman makes me identify more as a woman makes me want to be a woman what is so hateful about acknowledging that reality nothing and think about it is that um we you lay it out that way it actually helps people who maybe would not understand trans people understand the whole problem with trans activists in the trans community is they don't bridge the gap between the right and the left they stay on the left and they only adhere to those talking points Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner is the one who voted Trump right yeah but but still probably not the best spokesperson yeah so still not doing it the way we've done but um the thing about it is when it comes to this whole topic everyone just talks past each other and no one gets anything done so I prefer to leave the emotional arguments out of it when it comes to trans stuff because it makes more sense people on the right and those are you know my people as well yeah I mean and would you call yourself on the right or yeah for sure for sure and that's why I feel like I'm bit more understanding of the rights difficulties understanding trans people and that's why I really other than me you mentioned Caitlyn Jenner there really and no other people doing shows like this and doing right-wing shows and really bridging that gap and able to communicate to those people so it was your family right-wing I mean did you come from a Republican family or were they or you the are you the political black sheep of the family um it was half-and-half my mom's side was the liberal side my dad's side was the conservative side so that made for an interesting dichotomy as far as growing up trans as well hmm I kind of always been like in the middle of everything right you know being transit and then hopping like conservative family and then being conservative myself but you know it's it's been complicated did the conservative family were they resistant to your new identity or did they kind of go along with it uh resistant for sure I mean it wasn't anything ugly it wasn't anything like throwing you out of the house no I was never abused or anything but and my dad was fine but it was difficult it's getting better now though which is great now that I'm an adult and I'm you know I take care of myself now and doing my thing and they appreciate me going on shows like that like most famous person on YouTube you know clearly been successful in this commentary this brings up the the right-wing resistance to transgenderism moving of transgenderism to a lot of the activism that comes out of it I think a lot of it is about the pronouns and I struggle with this myself I don't know which to use because my reason tells me just as you said you know you you're born a man you'll die a man but you now more resemble you were certainly resemble a woman you don't look like a man so my reason tells me it would be objecting to reality to say she and yet you're my guest you're my friend you're my politeness would object to calling you he you and you you and and obviously in terms of secondary sex trait it's you you certainly look much more like a woman how do we resolve this this issue between manners and politeness and civil society and the biological facts of sex will you certainly don't legislate it I think that's a huge problem I was just reading the other day and 2018 there's about to be like harsher penalties for misgendering someone in the health field than for spreading HIV which is insane that's right I saw that there making it will no longer be a felony to intentionally excuse me to intentionally spread HIV California the master generally trees yeah just a mess but again you don't legislate it because that turns people off in it it also creates trans people makes trans people a liability when they become employees you know no company wants to hire someone who is potentially a lawsuit you know what I mean so that's a problem and that's another thing it's like a double sided swore because they're trans activists claim to fight for it trans unemployment and then they do things like that um but again it with pronouns it's like it just do what makes sense you know what I mean like for instance if you and I were to go to dinner or something and I got there before you used Oz at the table and you told people at the front like I'm meeting my friend you wouldn't say he's in the black top yeah that's right because they were using Sookie dresser for someone else right so it's just about what makes sense um unfortunately there are a lot of people who seem hell-bent on having things not make sense you know what I mean people who want to be referred to you with you know third pronouns fourth pronouns is a singular day is the worst one that that is unforgivable it is such an offense to grammar I can't imagine it and it's frustrating for me when I'm in those situations I just don't hang out people like that if I'm around them I'm not going to be intentionally rude or anything but I would prefer not to hang out with someone who has like that high expectations for a normal conversation with them it's kind of annoying but other than that just do what make sense is there a worry that the pronouns kind of give up the the premises so in the pronouns in any polite society you would just say she and her to refer to you you you identify as a woman you look like a woman just go with it but is there something to worry about that in that premise by granting the premise that one can change biological sex from male to female from him to her that we're giving the left a a premise from which many of their arguments will flow even if it's not a correct premise does that make sense I didn't say that articulate makes absolute sense um I guess in a sense but at the same time it's still about what makes sense I mean I don't even think it's giving the left that I think they already have that they're gonna take it yeah you against it when the reality is like I don't think since I was a teenager I've ever been called heat like even like pre-transition when I was starting to grow my hair out didn't know her loans no surgery I still never got called Pete see what I mean so it's it's just about common sense obviously when it comes to some people there's this one trans activist I believe her name is Danielle Moscato I think it's Daniel Moscato and she's made like no I'm saying she cuz I'm polite but she's made no attempt to do anything like literally male clothes bald head no makeup no anything no in every way no legal gender and every way it looks manlier than you like well I'll take it you know unfortunately there are a lot of guys who look manlier than me and so when it comes people like that is very frustrating um because they'll make a huge deal about it but most trans people we have to remember like the Internet is like not real life so if you get in mind yeah a lot of these occupants like yeah there's crazy nuts on the internet but most trans people orders this doesn't doesn't doesn't matter of course and and also there weren't that many transgender people you know the the statistic for a long time was he was point 2 percent of the population or even less now that some surveys say that number is point six percent of the population I think obviously there are differing numbers because it's such a small population uh-huh and yet it's all anyone's talking about and I do think that the left has made us so reactionary on this you know I thought they do this on everything they've but they've incredibly made crossdressers not fun I don't know how they did that cross dressers have always been fun throughout all of history it makes it like somber think makes the the Village in New York like this very serious social you know come on man they've done it on college campuses they've made sex boring I don't know how they did that yeah I've always said like yeah they've always said you know transgenderism is and should exist outside of the normal politics because it's not political it's biological it's neurological it's a conditioned psychological yeah and when you start politicizing things like that I mean it would suck just as much if they started politicizing I don't know autistic people are something right right you know making a group of people who are going through enough like the political football is really frustrating and it was a left fault because they made it you know their issue I often say I almost missed the day as one like no one really knew what it meant like everyone has kind of always known there are some like males who you know live as females you know but no one's ever gotten to the Nitty Gritty of it and now everyone's debating these small like insignificant facets of what it is to be trans people yeah and they're making but it is right now it is dominating the national conversation all we're talking about is bathrooms you know actually fortunately since President Trump was elected we're talking about like jobs in North Korea again but before that there's just only bathrooms that's the Nash why is that what about 2017 our culture left or right is makes this relatively minor issue dominate the national discourse right I mean first of all I always say I don't like to be expected to use to spend my knowledge of how the real world works to have these conversations because I've never had a problem using any public bathroom I've been in the Midwest I've been in Michigan I've been in California where it's super liberal and it's like I just I've been in Texas I don't have an issue what most people I know don't have an issue so it's frustrating to see that become such a huge thing when already like you said it's such a small amount of people and it's even smaller the people in that group who actually have an issue yeah I mean it's just a symbol for the left though isn't it's just a way to to poke the culture I think yeah but I do think a lot of conservatives fall into the trap of like ending up caring about it what I mean of course I think that's such a huge trap they fall into I would prefer to see the conservative movement in the future focus on reclaiming like more of a position and culture as far as arts and stuff like that because the Left dominates all of that and it's really frustrating you know what I mean and they think you know that I think the right things that they're gonna win this battle on pronoun legislation which is coming by the way it's it's in other countries it's coming yeah so that they are gonna do that and obviously we have to fight back against that and I hope the right ones I hope the right wins on that I mean they're going to they're going to focus on this bathroom legislation but really that's not where that politics is down stream of culture right conservatives are such Philistines that we don't realize that orange is the new black or something or transparent has a much greater effect on the culture then apps then our little legislation or our political candidates absolutely and I'm also say this one thing I've learned from doing a lot of conservative shows and talking to a lot of conservative hosts you're not included in this but almost all of them have told me that they have they don't have nearly as much of an issue with the trans saying as their audience pressures them to act out and the sense that it's almost like it's just become a talking point and it's become you know being Pro trans or anti trans it's just a talking point at this point and people are forgetting you know that it's not that huge of an issue so that's that's interesting because we you know I don't ever get questions about it in the mailbag I think it is I think it's literally the pronouns I think that's I think that's what they care they don't want someone to tell them that I am gonna dictate to you how you can view reality I think it's there I don't think the issue among our audience I don't think it's about transgender at all I think it's about lefties bullying them into submission basically I have that's true of other audiences but I think it's that is common on the right I think it's Jan if the left would let it up they'd say like alright man for the for the 18 people who have this affliction you know yeah it's just trying to do what you're gonna do yeah becomes actually unnecessary war but then it gets to the point where it is necessary ya know so getting to you we've talked about politics gazillion excellent videos on your channel that people can learn about this but getting to you you haven't had an easy life you've had personal difficulties you I wouldn't share this if it were in public but you made a video that you were raped and as a teenager obviously transitioning and this gender dysphoria has to be psychologically stressful and to add on top of that all of these lefties hurled insults at you all the time on the Internet yeah what what keeps you going what keeps you motivated is it the religious conviction is it a sense of mission political mission I guess just the fact that despite everything I really lifelike I really love what I'm doing I made my transition happen for myself no one paid for it but myself I've always up to this point pretty much gotten everything I wanted because I worked for it and I've made it happen for myself I'm just like in a really good place in life and I really love doing YouTube I I guess a lot of the emails I get from people saying that you know I'm saying things they could never say and you know all of that kind of stuff really he was been going as well and you know I have a good family I have good friends an amazing boyfriend life is good you know people everyone goes through stuff it's just about choosing to overcome it or live in that you know do you think it's that though I mean you have every reason to have a victim mentality you've got this difficult issue by nature of your birth then you've had these other issues come on but you don't haven't chosen to be there no I think that's why not you can cash that in a lot of cash in the sculpture um I just think that's not a healthy way to live I think you know being soft starving is good but when he gets when you're doing good things when you're being self-serving in the sense of just feeling pity for yourself and expecting things to be handed to you because something may have happened to you in the past I mean it's really gross and unhealthy that's not a way I want to live I prefer to you know work hard try for my goals be happy being loved all that stuff I much prefer that does this does this come from any kind of religious point of view is that is it at some traditional point of view or did you just stumble on these very profound guides to life on your own just comes from no it just comes that you know system being spun by Blair white yeah I've never been religious but I think actually now that you said it it does come from my dad sorry their family um hard work and never feeling sorry for yourself and just getting what you want was always something and sold in me from that side of the family I think it just stuck with me it's just how I was raised I guess that good old American Civic religion right absolutely right right hard work and not pitying yourself and just going out there and getting really famous and making a bunch of money that's the American dream NJ and now all right I could talk to you all day but we have this excellent panel of deplorable z that we have to bring on and ELISA see that I know I know you want to listen to the panel of deplorable blares gonna stick around for the panel we have to talk about all of the important political issues like mm stupid rap and fat kids and the boy now Girl Scouts but you don't get any of that unless you go to daily wire.com and subscribe we want to thank everybody who has already subscribed you help us keep the lights on you let me polish my Rachel Maddow glasses it's a really good life here but for those of you who haven't you got to go over there right now it's $10 a month $100 a year you get me at the end reclaim and show you get the Ben Shapiro show yada yada yada I know but wait there's more the leftist here's tumblr this every time I go out in public I carry on my phone a little Blair white video a little commentary video I take the lid off my tumblr and I just collect them and they pour down like I'm in the center of the Amazon rainforest so make sure this is the perfect vessel the only vessel to contain your leftist tears they're delicious have them hot have them cold always salty very satisfying daily wire calm right now we will be right back panel thank you for being here we have Ariel Davidson from the Hoover Institution we have amber Athey from the Daily Caller ladies welcome and happy International Day of the girl what a privilege to have you here we have to talk about this very important news today the rapper Eminem belched some gibberish about Donald Trump last night at the bee et Awards let's hear it wait gonna start this huh I forgot oh yeah that's an awfully hot coffee pot should I drop it on Donald Trump probably not but that's all I got till I come up with a solid got a plan and now I got a hatchet like a my patchy would have tomahawk I'm a walk inside a mosque on Ramadan and say a prayer that every time talks she gets a mop ah I'm a stop but we better give Obama props cuz what we got an office now's a kamikaze that'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust we have come a long way from Bach haven't we Arielle everybody tells me that Eminem is a great lyricist but that sure does not sound like Wordsworth to me what am I missing so I actually got myself into some trouble today because I started comparing Eminem and saying 2pac was a much better lyricist which I stand by I think there are some elements within our discussion of and then we have to be able to separate sort of his past history as being a great lyricist to his current piece of crap that he produced excuse my French um so I think that you know he is a talented rapper given his you know the style of art he usually partes in this is a pretty abysmal piece of work and I'll leave it at that I think I come for economically you know really pay homage the fact that the Iran deal which is Obama's crowning achievement in terms of foreign policy actually the risk of creating a nuclear crisis but I will step away and let the other ladies speak on that too we see you're not I'm sorry you're not going to grant professor mm his premises I do have to disagree with you on both mmm Tupac because my favorite rapper is puff doggie dog and snoop snoop diddly dudette so I guess we can compare taste is subjective you know who can really tell which is best after all amber is this just a desperate attempt of a has-been to stay relevant or does Eminem have something to offer our culture in 2017 gosh who knows maybe a bit of both but like Ariel said this is the most pathetic attempt at rapping I think I've ever seen and actually pretty disappointing as someone who used to listen to Eminem I used to be into rap in like middle school in high school because I thought I was cool or whatever working he has thank you I appreciate that a lot of people would disagree with you he had some pretty disgusting lyrics in his time you know he talked about throwing women and in the trunk of the car and driving him off bridges and raping women and stuffing them in the closet so for him to the best you can come up with his throwing hot coffee on Donald Trump it's a little disappointing I think he can do a lot better yeah where is his vicious thuggery it really was lacking from that last night Blair that is an excellent point that she brings up why does the media give this guy a pass he said horrible things about gays about women and yet I noticed that none of that was present in their coverage of this today right they're so picky choosy with you know their little pets are what's really interesting I was watching the view this morning and Joy Behar it was first of all her voice is grating but second of all she was talking about how he's so brave for speaking out against the president it's like in what world every artist every celebrity right now is speaking out against the resume it's like roaches it's gross and the thing about it like the Freestyle was trash for sure my boyfriend told me this morning apparently he had two albums recently didn't know that I guess didn't do all so and then he also I I think when George Bush was in office he like I said he wanted him dead or something it's just as courageous as Michael Moore yeah I haven't I haven't bought the latest mmcd either I think I loved the 90s they were great in 2000 but just leave them in the past man let's move on to the future speak speaking of the future we there is a new study yet a new study that shows the greatest health crisis afflicting our troubled planet and that is fat kids obesity rates among children and teenagers have plateaued apparently in the UK at 10 percent 20 percent in the United States the u.s. currently pays 325 billion dollars per year to treat all of the negative health effects that come as a result of that now in Asia North Africa in the Middle East child obesity rates are skyrocketing Blair the world is so prosperous that for the first time in history the health problem is that our children are too fat they're too well fed once we finally perfect the sex robots will our culture just wither away from too much luxury probably that's so heartbreaking even here I went to school for nutrition for a while so that kind of like hits home it's really sad you know I consider it child abuse honestly to have an OB style of playing at that young of an age that's Charlie is for sure and amber does this finally put an end all these stupid fads this blair mentions there there's a little bit of child abuse perhaps going on but we always hear about how terrible GMOs are and trans fat and gluten and yada yada yada and they're supposed to kill us and yet we're like the best fed people ever and we live to be a hundred is will this finally put an end all the nonsense and the kale and the avocados and all of that no probably not because unfortunately food is politicized to to the point where the left sort of tastes like the GMO and environmental organic issues and tries to make it a political talking point and then another part of this that I think is political is this talk about like plus-sized models and healthy at any size and you can't fat shame people and to me as someone who used to be overweight I think that's so disappointing because like no you shouldn't bully someone for being overweight but I think it's good for people to know that that's it's not okay it's not healthy for you to be 300 pounds at the age of 12 and maybe you should do something about it to change it and really the only person that can that can change that is yourself you can't expect society to just accept that as as healthier or okay Blair I know you're a really strong advocate of the anti fat shaming movement isn't that right no it is interesting how a lot of this is done in the name of supporting women but supporting this message of healthy to any size etc is actually it hurts women you know women don't want to be fat women want to be beautiful that's part of you know the nature of women is to be attractive be desired that's scientific I was trying to be attractive and desired to man brash to less success c'est la vie I'm sorry I cut you off right so it's like I said in the name of women but it's lying to women as well which is frustrating Arielle Andrew Clavin has pointed this out before that you know they say we live in decadent times our colleges dawn to decadence you know but decadence is very good for the elites and we're all elites today aren't we in the United States in the developed world is is this a sign of our decadence I mean the fact that the we don't have to worry really as much about starvation as we do about overeating where does a culture go from here when it's so luxurious and so well fed in so many ways you know I think it's a sign of decadence I also think it's showing sort of the primacy the technology has started to place in our lives um you know you don't really need to get up to in order to get things physically we can just order things on Amazon now you don't need to you know there's no impetus to step outside and play with your friends now you can just play video games or enter a virtual world this is the next step that Facebook is taking so pretty much - in order to get anything you like you have to you don't really have to do much to get it so it's sort of like you can just sit on your couch engage and you pretty much get what you want it's a very strange phenomenon but I think technology has a lot to do with it that's absolutely right and there are few things I like more than sitting on my couch and getting anything there is breaking news that came out an hour ago that the Boy Scouts will now fully admit girls to be the Boy Scouts and the girls can go as high up in the ranks as they want to they can become Eagle Scouts and we're by the way we're not talking about transgender people we're not doing about a girl who identifies as a boy and then joins the Boy Scouts just full-on girls can become Boy Scouts now Blair on these issues of gender you have a unique perspective that's so funny I thought you were talking about you know trans cont or something it's just girls it's just work it's just the boy skate I think it's a money grab you know men are all about the money and I think they're just trying to take away all the Girl Scouts now - does this make any sense I mean in a certain sense by our culture's logic it does in that the left has always told us gender is a social construct it doesn't really matter of course simultaneously they tell us it's the most important thing in the world does it make any sense for the Boy Scouts to now be taking away all of the Girl Scouts I mean I guess it's not like the hugest injustice in the world but at the same time I mean maybe it sounds funny coming from someone who's trans but I do believe in traditional gender roles I think it's really healthy for a society so the idea that were not teaching boys three boys anymore not teaching girls to be girls I mean obviously listen I'm trans but I think you can let your transmit you're not saying that the categories of gender are meaningless quite the opposite you can support traditional gender roles and traditional gender well you know acknowledging that there's some people that fall outside of that made you think that they should just keep it separate you know what I mean like I think that's good for a little boys to be running the little boys etc Ariel are you gonna send your daughter into the Boy Scouts make it make a good Eagle Scout ever well I think what was interesting about their announcement was that they were saying oh you know we want to do this because there are some girls that want to be part of the Boy Scout mission and I said to myself what is this why we have Girl Scouts yeah um Beckett Adams actually had a great tweet today on Twitter where he said eventually they're just going to you you know the Boy Scouts are gonna be flooded with girls so then the the boys are gonna leave the Boy Scouts and head to the girls to join the Girl Scouts yeah switching of roles and then we'll rename them again to the Girl Scout the Boy Scouts so I you know there's something cooks really important about how we you know I I went to single sex education for nine years from kindergarten to eighth grade I found it to be hugely beneficial to have sort of an environment that was girls only but a way for you to you know relate to other women without sort of the social pressures that boys might present in the picture so I think there's something really valuable having the saint's preserving the sanctity of girls only Girl Scouts and boys only Boy Scouts but that's just my personal opinion there's been lots of research done that shows that boys brains develop very differently than girls brains and you know when you tailor an experience to match that developmental path it could be hugely beneficial I don't know necessarily how they'll be able to carry this out if there's some sort of mixing but you know that's totally up to them I think it's pretty I think it's utterly ridiculous I think we'll see some pushback from some parents but only time will tell you know Ariel having gone to school from all of those years that you were in single sex education having gone to a school where boys and girls commingle and go to school together I too will be sending my daughter to a single sex education school I gets a great idea you know different ways that develops and keep them away from those awful awful boys amber the Girl Scouts are not happy about this they sent out a statement last time the boys gets moved in this direction basically saying keep your hands off our scouts we we do not want our organization to dissolve will the this kind of gender discourse that's happening right now will this lead to the end of all female institutions such as all female sports all female educational institutions if single sex schools have to admit boys now then with her single single sex schools yeah I don't know yeah for example sports if I say a terrible idea because as much as liberals would have you believe boys and girls are biologically different and it's really dangerous actually to have them playing sports together in terms of just specifically the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts I actually tweeted about this earlier today I was in Girl Scouts for three years and I sympathize with them being worried that the Boy Scouts are going to steal their scouts away because Girl Scouts is absolutely terrible I actually ended up quitting because I was so bored because I was kind of a tomboy when I was when I was young so I wanted to go and make fires and like shoot guns and shoot all I wanted to do is eat cookies we could have traded places I know right so I always always really jealous of the Boy Scouts because they got to go off and go camping and don't let school stuff and Girl Scouts at least with my troop leader didn't get to do that but the answer to that isn't to take away the boys only in girls only space is that like Ariel said I think are super important to development the answer is to just make Girl Scouts better make the Girl Scouts better I know I agree we need more cookie flavors absolutely I couldn't agree more amber okay that is all of our time today panel thank you for being here especially Blair white thank you for being so nice debut in
