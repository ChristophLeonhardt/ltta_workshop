and registered refugees making their way through EU countries or a headache for several member states now a letters come to light in which the Dutch migration Minister seems to know exactly who to blame he's pointed a finger straight out Greece and Italy 95% of irregular migrants and asylum seekers arrived from other Schengen states about two-thirds of them managed to enter and travel through other member states undetected and unregistered despite all measures taken to improve registration so as you can see also questioned the European Commission's previous claims that nearly a hundred percent of migrants arriving in Greece in Italy are being registered and he wants EU members who won't share the burden of taking in refugees to be punished free-writing should have a price Member States refusing to demonstrate solidarity in violation of their EU obligations should be penalized through cuts in EU subsidies I got reaction from Greece and journalist and I said see Kamali's member of Greece's governing Surratt's a party she told me the migrant crisis is a europe-wide problem that singling out to countries to blame is unfair the thing is that Europe has failed to provide a holistic and inclusive solution to the problem it's a union it cannot prove also its solidarity Alucard the refugee crisis is not a Greek or an Italian problem and it cannot be managed as an Italian or a Greek problem it's a European problem and Greece and Italy have handled that all the burden of this whole situation I think that the criticism is a bit unfair Greece and Italy are dealing with the refugee and migrant crisis with dignity while there are European member states that have resisted the relocation quarters that have resisted to abide by the EU turkey agreement that have resisted to take on refugees and migrants I can tell you we've put the Dutch migration ministers claims to the European Commission if they do get back to us we'll update you with what they had to say in response
