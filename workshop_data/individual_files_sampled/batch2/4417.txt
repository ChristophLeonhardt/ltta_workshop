I said Troy why did you invite Trump in here the president he said no I didn't so you know I think Donald Trump decides where he wants to go and I think they think they're firing it up the base but I have to tell you at the same time he comes in here I was with some women last night who said hey you know what I'm not voting they're Republicans I'm not voting for the Republicans see this is the problem the party has now and that of course is the sitting governor of Ohio John Kasich on this week's on this week on ABC News discussing president Trump's involvement in tomorrow's special election in his state as the governor noted some Republicans are worried the president could actually hurt some GOP candidates and not help take for example the president's decision today to endorse the Secretary of State of the state of Kansas Kris Kobach for governor Kobach has been an outspoken supporter of Trump's voter fraud allegations he is challenging the Republican incumbent governor of Kansas jeff colyer it's an endorsement the Republican Governors Association and other party leaders were hoping to avoid polls show if ko Bach advances he could have a tough time winning the general election come November we are joined by two of our frequent contributors who we are so happy to have with us here in New York david jolly former republican congressman from florida and anita kumar White House correspondent for McClatchy Newspapers the one great thing about the president coming to New Jersey as we get all of our friends who cover the White House just across the Hudson River congressman I'd like to begin with you do you think it's a when I ask you what your survival chances are as a non Trump Republican member of Congress trying to seek reelection is that a moving target almost on a daily basis it is but some things are coming into focus as we get closer to Election Day first is in a Republican primary Donald Trump has the Midas touch I mean he can shift a race in a Republican primary dramatically this is his party every candidate in a Republican primary today including in Florida is trying to get as close to the President as possible but what we also know in a general election and this goes to Kansas and the concern of the Republican Governors Association in every single special election since Donald Trump got elected every special congressional election every single one of them Republicans have underperformed under the Trump administration and Democrats have over performed and we have yet to see a battle in a truly competitive congressional district we've yet to see those 23 to 24 Republican held districts that Hillary Clinton actually won in 2016 that is where disaster could be in play if Donald Trump continues to play in these races I neither his numbers can't be disputed do you think Kansas is the great laboratory to watch in this in this event well I mean it's really interesting because it's so surprising he got in right because for all the reasons we just said but a lot of reasons it's not surprising these two go back a long way Donald Trump jr. has already been there twice they talk frequently I think they just talked the other day on Saturday so they don't have the typical relationship they have a close relationship some of these other people may not other Republicans may not know the president as well so we you know the the campaign had been expecting since February that the president might endorse they heard that he might and so they'd kind of been expecting it and welcoming it so I think Kansas is a little bit different than some of these other places also congressman the president's Twitter feed for all the good and all the bad to your point really does move voters it does and and listen we see this in Florida right now we have a Republican gubernatorial candidate we do you who for twenty years has been positioned themselves to be governor hey down the line conservative who because Trump endorsed his opponent of freedom caucus hardline trumpian Republican is now going to lose this race the Trump candidate has as pole-vaulted to the lead but we're going to get to a very competitive November environment where Democrats could have the greatest opportunity they've had in 20 years Donald Trump has none of the down ballot positives in November but he has all the down ballot negatives and that is why if you're a Republican facing a blue wave and you've embarrassed Ahnold Trump you could be in real trouble in November I'm gonna talk to you about aspirations and I'm gonna talk to our journalists about reality so starting with you what would you like the GOP bumper sticker for the midterm elections party wide to read I hope the GOP loses in November because I think we need a hard reset because I think under Donald Trump we've abandoned who we are as a party what I expect Republicans to try to sell the American people are the following Donald Trump make America great again it's the only message they have they will say they voted for lower taxes and Democrats voted for higher taxes and they will sell you fear and xenophobia talking about border security that truly only impacts about 5% of the constituency but what Republicans cannot overcome is the American people don't trust the Republican Party today and I don't think ideology matters as much going into November Democrats selling Medicare for all Obamacare $15 minimum wage it's important to lay those principles out the question for voters in November is do you trust Donald Trump in the Republican majority in Congress because I don't think 51% of the country does now Anita what do you think the current bumper sticker is for the Trump I think does it make America great again is it that simple I think it's it every minute it changes so I think you know I hear from Republicans in Washington that they want it to be the economy they want it to be tax cuts though you know the things that we all think right maybe border security maybe some health care and there but that's really what they want to talk about that the president talked about the economy remember week and a half ago when some of the jobs numbers came out I can't remember the president came out unannounced into the Rose Garden and he had this speech about the economy and how great it was oh yeah well we're cheering Republicans were cheering that speech that's what they want him to do for the next three months now that's not what's going to happen for the next three months what's gonna happen is we're gonna have tweets about LeBron James we're gonna have tweets about the Russia hoax and the witch hunt and you know all sorts of people insulting all sorts of people just because he can't stay on message we before we were talking about how he went to his first Trump rally a Trump political rally is 90 minutes he talks about everything it's not about the candidate he's there to support it it's usually about himself and it's about a million things under the Sun so we cannot expect it will be about the economy hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with
