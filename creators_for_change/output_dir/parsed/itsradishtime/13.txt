You and I buy star maps and drive my car around
Los Angeles
You and I buy star maps and ding dong ditch
a televangelist
And it's only been a week
But I know that you are mine to keep
You are a radar detector
I drive a thousand miles an hour, I won't
go on and on
But you are always looking out for me because
You are a radar detector, you are a radar
detector
You are a radar detector, you are a radar
detector
You are a radar detector, you are a radar
detector
You are a radar detector
You are a radar detector
I drive a thousand miles an hour, I won't
go on and on, and on and
You are always looking out for me
Hi friends,
So I have a long history of parade participation.
I was in a dance company In middle school
and high school, so every christmas and st
patrick’s day and something called “good
neighbor fest” in the summer I put on my
jazz pants and did kick ball changes and lindys
down a deceptively long parade route, to,
like, rockin’ around the christmas tree,
on loop.
I don’t think i ever really understood why
anyone would go to a parade, just to stand
out in weather that is either too hot or too
cold just to like, wave at the children of
the employees of their local bank.
However, HOWEVER.
I have had a change of heart.
I went to Brooklyn’s Pride parade last weekend,
it was my first one.
Even though I’ve been out as bi in varying
degrees for about 3 years now, I was moving
around a lot and New York City pride is always
the same weekend as Vidcon and it’s never
worked out.
Also speaking of Vidcon I’ll be there next
week, let me know in comments if you will
too.
Anyway, brooklyn pride, is not the same as
new york city pride.
Instead of giant corporations with big fancy
floats, we got the local HVAC company, and
a scouting troop, and a whole lot of churches.
The churches definitely got me the most emotional
as a lapsed catholic who grew up getting the
“hate the sin not the sinner” speech at
summer camp.
Well now i’ve got a sticker.
Try and hate me now.
There were cheerleaders, they were cool but
I think it was a missed opportunity to change
their uniforms from Cheer New York to Queer
New York
Also, there were two.
TWO! seperate all femme identified drumlines.
And so many good boys.
I got a rainbow bookmark from my public library
I put on a lot of Fenty shimmer match stix
on my face.
AND I got to hold hands with my girlfriend
in public without doing the whole reflexive
“look both ways to gut check for homophobes”
thing we all do.
And I got frozen yogurt after.
It was a really fun time.
Pride started as a protest, and that’s an
important part of our history to remember
and to continue.
But i think sometimes as a three sport competitor
in the oppression olympics, that like sometimes
we’ve been through enough.
Sometimes we wanna fight for our cake and
eat it too, you know?
We deserve a little innocent, corny, harmless
fun.
So if you’re also celebrating pride this
year, tell me how in the comments.
If you liked this video, please share it with
someone else you think might like it too.
If you’re at Vidcon come see me—I’ll
be on a panel called “We’re Here” about
queer and marginalized identities and I’ll
also be moderating a panel called Finding
Your Style & Voice.
If I don’t see you there, I will still see
you soon.
Bye!
