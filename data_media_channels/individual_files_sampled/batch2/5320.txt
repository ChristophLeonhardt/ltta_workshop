this was day 5:50 of the Trump administration for some perspective Helsinki was a week ago today for the past three days the president has embarked on fresh new attacks on the Muller investigation a warning to Iran and new threats to the intelligence community Trump's renewed push comes in the wake of scathing reviews of his meeting with Vladimir Putin and subsequent walk back attempts on his comments doubting US intelligence on Russia's election interference a dozen audiotapes at least one with trump's voice on it seized from his former court michael Cohen's office they're all now in the hands of feds the growing Muller investigation which will soon feature the trial of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort also tonight The Wall Street Journal says Trump's legal team is still talking to Muller The Journal reports it this way Trump's legal team has submitted a counteroffer to Special Counsel Robert Muller on a possible interview with the president that could allow for questions about collusion with Russia but curtail inquiries related to obstruction of justice as negotiations for a sit-down are set to enter their eighth month Rudy Giuliani a lawyer from mr. Trump said Monday that an interview between the special counsel and the president is still on the table Giuliani also toured the told the journal quote the president's legal team is open to him answering questions about possible collusion with Moscow what is the president said about that no collusion in his newest swipes at the Muller investigation Trump described it as a big hoax as the conflicted and discredited Muller witch-hunt and then as a disgrace to America adding they should drop the discredited Muller witch-hunt now Trump is also taking on a half dozen top former intelligence officials some big names and looking at potentially revoking their security clearances including former CIA director and these days NBC News and MSNBC analyst John Brennan one thing all of these names have in common they have all spoken out publicly against this president not only is the president looking to take away Brennan's security clearance he's also looking into the clearance is of Comey clapper Hayden rice and McCabe the president is exploring the mechanisms to remove security clearance because they've politicized and in some cases monetize their public service and security clearances making baseless accusations of improper contact with Russia or being influenced by Russia against the president is extremely inappropriate so just to be clear and to repeat in addition to Brennan the list includes former FBI director Comey former DNI James clapper former CIA director Hayden former national security adviser Susan Rice former FBI number two Andrew McCabe two of them Comey and McCabe no longer have security clearances that White House announcement followed a Twitter notice from Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky saying he'd asked the President to remove Brennan's privileges Brennan has been vocal in his criticism of Trump's news conference with Putin the effort to end his clearance appears to have started last week on the president's cable news network of choice John Brennan is an irresponsible partisan combatant who works for a cable news channel and has threatened the president on Twitter why in the world would he have a top-secret federal security clearance now this is alarming and if John Brennan still has top-secret clearance can he research Donald Trump can he research his family that also seems to echo what the president told CBS News last week when he named names of former intelligence officials in a list remarkably similar to what we heard today do you think any intelligence agencies US intelligence agencies are out to get you well certainly in the past it's been terrible you look at Brennan you look at clapper you look at Hayden you look at Comey I have no confidence in a guy like Brennan I think he's a total lowlife I have no confidence in clapper you know clapper wrote me a beautiful letter when I first went to office and it was really nice and then all of a sudden he's gone haywire because they got to him and they probably got him to say things that maybe he doesn't even mean no I certainly don't have confidence in past people you look at what's happened take a look at all of the shenanigans that have gone on very hard to have confidence in that group which brings us to our leadoff panel on a Monday night Peter Baker chief White House correspondent for the New York Times Ashley Parker Pulitzer Prize winning White House reporter for The Washington Post and Jeremy bash former chief of staff at the CIA and Pentagon also happens to be former counsel to the House Intelligence Committee Jeremy because you are the former Fed here I'd like to begin with you why do we offer security clearances to former very senior ranking intelligence officials including but not limited to our former CIA directors once they have left office it's to benefit the country Brian it's to benefit the current occupants of the leadership offices of those agencies so that they can call their predecessors and consult on some very complex and difficult issues that those current office holders may be facing and so it's done really to support the country I mean what's crazy about this move by the president Brian is that if he were to strip these former officials of security clearances it wouldn't hurt those former officials much at all most of them are doing things kind of unrelated it would really hurt the current agencies and I think it's really part of a long practice dating back to the very first days of the president in office when he went to the CIA and used that memorial wall as a political prop all through doubting the intelligence community assessments all through his attacks on our intelligence agencies right through this weekend when he called the whole intelligence community assessment about Russia hoax it's part of a long pattern and practice of attacking United States intelligence agencies so as an example jeremy of our current CIA gets a picture of the people around kim jong-un a longtime former player is missing from the picture they call Brennan and say what were your dealings with this guy do you remember this guy because he's no longer part of the picture that kind of thing that's a great example or if you're working with another intelligence service and you want some advice about how to handle some of the current players let's say those people are still in office and you so you call your predecessor and say hey John had you had you deal with this okay actually you're sitting there listening to Sarah Huckabee Sanders with the rest of us and this part of the briefing comes up and one word stuck out at you and that was monetized and to hear you're telling it to one of our producers it's one thing to criticize the president but if he thinks you're monetizing any piece of him by the way monetizing the presidency is what the Trump family writ large has been accused of since he took the oath but if he thinks you're monetizing him that crosses a red line it sure does so Sarah Sanders his whole statement jumped out at me but you're right specifically that word monetized and to be clear the president doesn't like critics he doesn't like people who have worked for past administrations especially President Obama but one of the things other again than the original sin of Russia that just really drives him crazy is this idea that people are getting rich off of him rich using his name rich criticizing him on a side note one interesting thing I learned was that Steve Bannon for instance one of the reasons why he's still at persona non grata in the administration is not just that he crossed the president on Russia but that the President believes incorrectly that Steve Bannon somehow made money off of Michael Wolf's book and so the idea that Steve Bannon again got rich being critical of the administration is something that just drives him crazy and I think the fact that Sarah used that word was incredibly telling when you listen to other aids in this White House talk about people especially who they think are making money with either books or television contracts by criticizing the president it is something that just bothers them across the board in this West Wing so Peter Baker as I mentioned Helsinki exactly a week ago tonight we were talking about that for a White House anxious to change the subject to anything but this would make a nifty shiny object but how about shiny object discipline when you think about the fact that two of the names on their list potentially getting their security clearance polled don't have security clearances yeah well it's obviously not a very well thought through or researched idea at this point when you put on people who aren't actually currently having security clearances but I don't know that it actually changes a subject I think in some ways it actually extends it because this is all sort of driven out of the Helsinki summit it's driven out of the idea that this is a president who has a relationship with Russia that has been questioned that's under investigation what he's basically saying is if you question me I will find a way to penalize you for that and so I think in fact it extends the questions about his relationship with Vladimir Putin rather than distracting from them I it what is he so afraid of if in fact he doesn't have you know an untoward relationship that he would want these people to be cut off from information he doesn't want them to have any access to classified data and therefore it gives the impression anyway of somebody who's trying to punish his enemies and prevent people who might say things that he doesn't like from having information that that would be based on that would base those statements hey there I'm Chris Hayes
