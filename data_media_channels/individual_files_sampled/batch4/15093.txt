let's start at the beginning what did the Alberta government do to essentially pick a fight with your business and render your product unprofitable so just just to set the stage it's very common across Canada four provinces to have obviously liquor taxes on products and the way that it's generally worked for beer and certainly is still the way that it works for beer in all provinces is that they have what is called a small Brewers markup and so they'll have a lower tax on products made by small breweries or micro breweries regardless of where those breweries are located so what happened in October of 2015 is that Alberta completely upended that approach what they did was overnight without warning on October 27th they announced that they were changing that for all breweries except the ones from Alberta Saskatchewan and British Columbia and that was done in order for them to honor as they said the new West Partnership which is a trade agreement signed by the three westernmost provinces and so overnight they raised the tax on our products five hundred and twenty five percent so everybody every brewery that was outside of the new West Partnership went to the highest beer markup which is a dollar twenty-five a litre and all of the breweries that we represented at the time had been at 20 cents a liter that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta Conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
