1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,859
I hate math, but there’s this statistics
problem that has me geeking out. It’s a

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:11,740
question that seems really really simple but
it’s stumped me. And not just me, it has

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,170
stumped thousands of people around the world
including math professors and leading statisticians.But

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,480
before we dive in I’m going to introduce
you to Zachery Crockett. He first introduced

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,230
me to the puzzle and I called him up to talk
about it.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,279
My name is Zachery Crockett, I’m a writer
for Priceonomics.

7
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,359
Zachery and his girlfriend were confused by
the problem too.

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,550
We just sat there debating the answer to this
problem for two hours and I don’t think

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,480
any of us really understood it.
The puzzle we were all stumped by is called

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,440
the Monty Hall Problem -- named after the
host of the game show that made it famous.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,360
the problem goes like this: there’s a brand
new car behind one of three doors. Behind

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,489
the other 2 are goats. Say you pick door 1.
Monty then shows you the goat behind one of

13
00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:01,469
the doors you DIDN’T choose - say, door
3. Now here’s the question: You’re allowed

14
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,350
to change your answer to Door 2. Do you switch?
Or stick with your original choice?

15
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,049
So yeah, I got interested in the Monty Hall
Problem, did a little research, and then I

16
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:20,549
found out there was this whole second angle
to the story.

17
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:30,590
You’ve never met a man that feared you a
little bit because he thought you were much

18
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:37,090
brighter than he was?
That’s Marilyn Vos Savant in 1988 being

19
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:44,759
interviewed by Joe Franklyn.
Yeah maybe I’ve met a man or two, maybe

20
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,850
a couple a hundred like that.
Marilyn is very intelligent. In fact:Back

21
00:01:51,850 --> 00:02:00,710
when the Guinness World Records actually kept
track of this she was the world’s highest

22
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,270
IQ.
She now writes for Parade Magazine and has

23
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,350
for the last 20 years.
So the premise of the column was of course,

24
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:02,430
like, here is the person with the world's
highest IQ here to answer your challenging

25
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:02,490
math questions.
This brings us to September 1990, when a reader

26
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:02,820
submitted to Marilyn... the Monty Hall Problem.
Is it to your advantage to switch your choice

27
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,030
of doors?
Now, if you’re like me the obvious answer

28
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,920
is no. There’s no advantage of switching
doors at all, There are two doors so the chance

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,270
of getting a car and not a goat is 50/50.
Bing. Bang. Boom.

30
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,830
But that’s the wrong answer, and Marilyn
knew that.

31
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,970
She replied: “Yes; you should switch.”
And here’s why.

32
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,930
Here are 3 doors.
There’s a goat behind 2 and a car behind

33
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,720
1.
In a blind test, you’re more likely to pick

34
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,480
a goat than a car. In fact, you’re 2/3RDS
likely so let’s use that as our main scenario.

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,530
You pick door 1.
So now, Monty Hall, who knows what’s behind

36
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,180
all the doors, is forced to reveal a goat
regardless of the door you pick. Since, in

37
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,700
the most probable scenario you’ve also picked
a goat, the only door left is the one with

38
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,500
the car.
So, now Monty Hall asks, “Would you rather

39
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,030
keep the door you’ve picked, or switch?”
Well, you should most definitely switch. If

40
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,860
you do you get the car 2/3rds of the time.
Turns out when Marilyn correctly answered

41
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,409
the Monty Hall Problem, she received thousands
of letters from across the world telling her

42
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,440
she was flat out wrong.
I think part of her was a little bit surprised

43
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,849
that she received 10,000 letters calling her
an idiot. There was, without a doubt a little

44
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:21,519
bit of sexism at play here. Not only was her
answer right, it wasn’t anything new.

45
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,120
The first time the Monty Hall problem was
published was in 1975. This guy named Steve

46
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,569
Selvin at Berkeley presented the problem in
The American Statistician.

47
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:40,690
Selvin said you should switch and no one argued
with him. And over the next 15 years multiple

48
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,849
other academics reiterated the same problem
without and no one ever told them that they

49
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,849
were wrong.
Then in 1990 Marilyn answered the same question

50
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:54,830
correctly and people went bananas.
Marilyn ended up and tallying up what percentage

51
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,390
of the 10,000 responses claimed she was wrong.
Only 8% of readers actually agreed with her

52
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,909
and after subsequent columns she was able
to raise that to 56%. And among academics:

53
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:15,510
It was 35% among academics initially supporting
the answer. And about 70% of academics ultimately

54
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,199
decided to agree with her.
The only way she managed to get people on

55
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,100
her side was by asking them to do the experiment
themselves. Elementary, middle school, and

56
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,840
high school teachers from all over the country
wrote in, astounded that their students were

57
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,270
able to prove her right.It’s easy now to
do a simple google search of this little sucker

58
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,430
of a problem and get a million explanations
on how to arrive at the right answer.

59
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,070
There's something about this problem that
really strikes a chord with, not only statisticians,

60
00:04:43,070 --> 00:00:00,000
but just everyday problem solvers and people.
