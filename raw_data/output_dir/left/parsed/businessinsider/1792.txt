hey guys we are live looking at the
Statue of Liberty there it is
from the Staten Island Ferry you're not
the only ones here obviously there's the
Statue of Liberty and we're just gonna
kind of ride this thing all the way to
Staten Island then back just kind of
taking in the views breathtaking views
of the city right now
beautiful day a little bit of smoke I
don't know if people see that coming
from
the boat itself one world trade right
there
basically looking at lower Manhattan
Financial District right here
Battery Park New Jersey over there
and shortly will be we will be at while
near the statutory we won't actually be
stopped look at this beautiful one world
trade
a couple other boats out on the water
here
and you can just make out the Brooklyn
and the Manhattan bridges back there
here's a view a little bit of the harbor
back of the city with some more votes
and in the water here
it's funny in New York from this vantage
point I mean it obviously is a huge
world-class City but here it looks kind
of like a mid-sized city like
Minneapolis or something the only one
you zoom really far out do you see just
how big Manhattan really is and you go a
little further uptown or you can see
that just the shape of it on this view
almost a full smaller you can't really
see the entire city in one in one glance
just New Jersey
all these folks
cleaning for the same view here there's
there it is Statue of Liberty
bastion of hope or something
such a beautiful day to be out here
like there's a couple catamarans out
there
let's get meta here
and try to enjoy the view from someone
else's I thought that didn't really work
I thought
one last look of Manhattan
you boys I really hope I don't drop my
phone
look at the sailboat here
New York actually just hosted the
America's Cup and this in this very
harbor couple months back
looking at New Jersey again we've been
at the water so calming a moment of
reflection here to be had
getting much closer to the statute
Gloria I'm a zoom in again
Trane's applicate how it looks in real
life because it appears so much closer
in person than it doesn't Nvidia
beautiful beautiful they happen
and if you're just joining us that we
are on the Staten Island Ferry going to
Staten Island hopefully this is kind of
like a little dubious I'm not so sure
but hopefully I can just get off at
Staten Island turn around come right
back to Manhattan I don't know that's
going to be a very my thought is that
it's gonna be kind of challenged
hopefully I don't get stranded
whoa don't know if you can see this
statue every rows and rows of people
that's a great question how often just a
ferry run not as often as I thought it
every half an hour it looks like more or
less runs constantly I don't know if
it's quite 24 hours but its class and by
the way this is free to do this anybody
can just show up take the ferry Staten
Island
I'm sure Staten Island's great you can
stay and hang out there for a little
while or you can just turn around come
right back we'll see
it's low in here reflect look at the
look in New Jersey the Statue of Liberty
just kind of enjoy the sights and sounds
of the Staten Island Ferry
and we're back
connection was interrupted
I guess that makes sense now all the
cellphone towers out here in the middle
of New York Harbor
a couple of times boats out here
riddle me this why is it that whenever I
see a tugboat it's always pushing the
barge instead of pulling I always see
them pushing barges to my mind
that doesn't make a whole lot of sense
but there's any boat experts out there
please tell me why they're always
pushing the bargains and never pulling
great source of confusion
bunch of party
we're here another tugboat pushing it
what's what's the deal is my crusader
gets what's pushing instead of
pulling tons of people o manna please
these kids are on to something
it isn't like mesmerizing to look at
this water one of my favorite things
about traveling by sea just kind of
gazing into water
while barges just hanging out
Staten Island approaches
I am after how quickly we boarded this
this ferry and how quickly it took off I
really doubt I'll be able to hop right
on the next one right after I get off
this cuz I can't just stay on the ferry
the whole let me do that so if you get
off the ferry kind of go out through the
exit and kind of loop back around and
hope then I get a good view again maybe
on the way back I'll see Brooklyn
Governors Island that could be cool
next day it's really hot I'm just gonna
come out here and just have my I'm just
gonna take a lunch come out here enjoy
the breeze breeze is so nice and enjoy
the view
I take it you know my boss probably
wouldn't appreciate me just taking like
a two-hour lunch to go dork around on a
boat up in the distance you can kind of
see like very industrial area that's
pretty much what Brooklyn used to look
like along the along the waterfront
there along the Brooklyn waterfront now
it's a bunch of parts of Brooklyn Bridge
City Park have you ever come to New York
go there it's amazing
I'm so surprised that so here I am on
the Staten Island Ferry just kind of
taking a joyride basically which you can
do for free I was really surprised this
is all paid for but if you want you can
just get on the ferry
photos being taken right here that I'm
basically in
as a journalist so you go out and cover
stories you know you're very close to
the center of attention sometimes rarely
your photo will be taken next to someone
who's like there's always always turns
out good
feeling ending up and other tourists
photos I will definitely look like a
goof
don't know if you can hear that but
there's definitely a flag flapping away
in the breeze right above and you can't
see it but I can hear
I'm just thinking about the open ocean
phasing softly out to leave this
in this case the abyss is New Jersey
gigantic cargo ship up ahead
huge
as some New Yorkers say
more folks thoughtfully thoughtfully
gazing
this is it folks will I be able to make
it back on this ferry or will I have to
spend I mean excuse me a half an hour in
Staten Island that's really kind of the
drama at play here yes beautiful is of
course wonderful you saw the Statue of
Liberty saw a New York skyline so
willful but the real question here today
is part of me is torn you know I want to
stay here and get the best footage I
also don't want to have to spend a half
an hour away from an experience that an
island New York was a quick trip far
away New York appears
so if you're just tuning in my big
dilemma is that I gotten on the Staten
Island Ferry which is free
that's amazing they've got these amazing
views the statue and you've got to see
New York and now I'm gonna try and get
off the ferry and then get right back on
right back on it again to go to New York
then only you stay on the ferry
you know stops the giant old boat often
this is there's a golf course I don't
know if you can see that huge industrial
park its natural Liberty just barely
visible and then of course New York and
Brooklyn we don't even see a little bit
of Brooklyn right now such a beautiful
day we out here
tugboats guiding along this huge
freighter
someone will be in stabbing them now
hustle to get back on this thing I want
to I want to get back on this thing and
I want to see Brooklyn I want to see the
Brooklyn side of the object Barry
we already saw the Western facing side
cute y'all ship here
you know yeah what the inside of this
thing looks like packed with people all
writing for free on the Staten Island
Ferry I'm sure there are a few just like
me who came here just to see the views
and they're gonna be we're gonna be
bumping elbows trying to trying to get
off this thing
oh there's a ferry terminal approaching
hopefully this is not the end of the
road it's only halfway
also if you're just joining up I'm kind
of calling this guy's personal
contemplative journey she looks out the
horizon
thinking deeply I'm sure
Here I am through the background it was
another photo
that way I don't got in the back
this is basically what the experience is
my spot has been taken it's okay I go
back here we are at the new backup spot
Staten Island right there
people may fund us out now
so much greenery it looks beautiful
I think it gets a bad rap
okay guys time for Mia how far
kind of in New York kind of staple is
that that no one understands everywhere
subways and now I know it's even on the
ferry speakers or something just not
calibrated somebody comes on no one
knows
that ends my rant
so I'm really gonna try this I've got a
lot of competition
going to try and leave and get back on
this very messy
No
but I can help
oh I don't know if anyone heard them the
boat is temporary so I don't even know
if there'll be another boat for me to
get on we'll see
flipping around so I can say hello
Oh
packed
the next others
my first time at the Staten Island Ferry
Terminal in Stanford
everyone's going this way so I'm just
gonna go this way as well
and I'd say though I've not been is
packed
that's rip look I have a feeling the
next boat is going to leave it
I can heat
welcome to Staten Island
what a glorious three minutes I'll be
spending in Staten Island
let's see here Harry
over here it's now 259
it's just a fad this is not bad okay how
many people are doing the same exact
thing that I'm doing
yeah just hop on that very hop on
turnaround hop off hop on the next one
let's hope that there is one set up
this had a dog smell my dad to make sure
that there wasn't anything nefarious in
it he was a good boy though didn't find
anything and oh my god there's something
there's a fairy oh right all right this
is great
here we go getting on the ferry gonna
turn around give you a little bit of the
oh there's another one right there I'm
gonna go on the top deck
so who are just joining me getting on
the Staten Island Ferry just got off one
getting right back on again oh there's
no higher okay well it's time to do just
fine
I think I found
found the spot
so that was a nice minutes Dunkin Donuts
so all the standard stuff Farias boarded
and I'm on it I can't believe that
happens by the way I was not the only
person who just rode the ferry just the
first four words of us okay guys this is
the spot this is where I'm gonna say
that I'm the king of the world
so stay tuned definitely stay tuned
we're looking at over here as per plan
yeah there is this bridge connects I'm
so satisfied
this is just for fun I'm sure
there's the bridge Staten Island
Brooklyn
there but we already saw that so find a
little nook here away from the winds
so scenic so many ferries that I mean
I'm assuming this is like how most
everyone commutes from Staten Island
so I did successfully go from New York
to Staten Island shuffled my way on to
the next ferry from Staten Island to New
York the one that I was on was first
like something wrong after that I guess
they announced over over the thing no
I'm not sure if that's reassuring
there's not much to see all the action
there that's a street it's really a
place that you want to see up close
Stachel already still yet to be seen
these kids learning some sort of lesson
about something
see if we can spot that statuary
follow this guy again
there we go the hunt for the Statue of
Liberty begins
just gonna chill here this is like just
the same exact people no statue I'm up
there it is
over there barely make it out I think
we'll take one more look and then I'll
sign off I mean I accomplished my goal
getting on to the next outbound ferry so
I think my work here is done well let's
try and get one more view the beautiful
statue over sight to be held from the
absolutely 100% free Staten Island Ferry
yeah there it is
way over there there we go New Jersey in
the background that folks thus ends the
live tour from the Staten Island Ferry
beautiful fairy 100 like just free which
is amazing leaves every half an hour on
the dot so check it out definitely do it
only took up what you know 45 minutes of
my time so it's been real guys thanks
for watching
