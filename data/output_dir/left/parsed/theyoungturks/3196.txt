>>NEW VIDEO SHOWS A NORTH KOREAN
DEFECTOR WHO MANAGED TO ESCAPE,
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS SHOT FIVE
TIMES IN THE PROCESS OF DOING
SO.
THIS WAS A 24-YEAR-OLD
MEMBER OF THE NORTH KOREAN
MILITARY, AND HE DID DEFECT, HE
DID MANAGE TO CROSS OVER TO
SOUTH KOREA, AND HE IS RECEIVING
MEDICAL ATTENTION AT THE MOMENT.
HE IS EXPECTED TO SURVIVE.
BUT THE STORY IS INSANE,
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TAKE A
LOOK AT THE VIDEO, TAKE A QUICK
LOOK AT THAT.
>>YOU SEE THE NORTH KOREAN
MILITARY JEEP SPEEDING PAST
CHECKPOINTS, HEADING TOWARDS THE
BORDER WITH SOUTH KOREA.
INSIDE,
THE SOLDIER BENT ON DEFECTING.
AS HE GETS CLOSER TO THE
DEMILITARIZED ZONE NORTH KOREAN
SOLDIERS REACTING FROM THERE
POST, SCRAMBLING TOWARDS THE
VEHICLE.
ONCE THE JEEP CRASHES
INTO A DITCH NEAR THE LINE THAT
DIVIDES THE TWO NATIONS, HE SETS
OUT ON FOOT, RUNNING, AS THE
NORTH KOREAN GUARDS BEGIN
SHOOTING.
DOZENS OF ROUNDS FIRED
AT THE DEFECTOR, EVEN AS HE
CROSSES THAT CRUCIAL LINE TO
FREEDOM.
>>AT SOME POINT THE NORTH KOREAN
SOLDIERS SEE HIM AND SEE WHAT
HE'S DOING, THEY START FIRING AT
HIM, MULTIPLE ROUNDS, AND
HITTING HIM, AND HE STILL
SURVIVES ENOUGH TO CRAWL TO
SAFETY, TO GET BEHIND THE WALL.
>>CRITICALLY WOUNDED, SHOT FIVE
OR SIX TIMES, HEAT SIGNATURE
FROM CAMERAS SHOW TWO SOUTH
KOREAN SECURITY FORCES CRAWLING
TOWARDS THE DEFECTOR TO CARRY
HIM OUT AND EVACUATE HIM TO
A NEARBY MEDICAL CENTER.
>>THAT IS GREAT FOOTAGE, AND A
GREAT REPORT BY ABC, CHECK OUT
THE LINK DOWN BELOW FOR THE
WHOLE REPORT.
LOOK, THAT IS THE
FIGHT FOR FREEDOM.
THAT WAS
AMAZING.
HE TOOK FIVE BULLETS
FOR FREEDOM.
A DAY LATER THEY
FLEW HIM TO A HOSPITAL DOWN PAST
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA AND REMOVED
FIVE BULLETS FROM HIS BODY.
>>THEY DID, AND TO GIVE YOU SOME
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY
TIMES THEY SHOT AT HIM,
ACCORDING TO REPORTS THE
SOLDIERS FIRED AT HIM ABOUT 40
TIMES, HITTING HIM WITH BULLETS
FROM BOTH PISTOLS AND AN AK-47.
ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE WAS
THE DEMILITARIZED SONG THAT HE
CROSSED INTO, AND AT THAT POINT,
THE NORTH KOREAN SOLDIERS BASED
ON A CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE SHOOTING AT HIM,
BUT THEY DID SO ANYWAY.
NOW
THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT THEY
VIOLATED THE ARMISTICE AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, I
DON'T THINK NORTH KOREA CARES AT
ALL.
>>IF YOU START FIRING INTO THAT
ZONE YOU ARE REALLY RISKING
WAR, AND THEY DID FIRE INTO THAT
ZONE, WHICH THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO DO, AND THEY PHYSICALLY
CROSSED OVER AS WELL.
NORTH
KOREA HAS A LOT OF BLUSTER AND
THEY DO A LOT OF MISSILE TESTS,
BUT GENERALLY THEY DON'T CROSS
THAT ZONE.
IF THEY DO THEN
OBVIOUSLY SOUTH KOREA WILL CROSS
IT BACK AND WE ARE BACK IN THE
MIDDLE OF A WAR.
IT WAS A
DANGEROUS MOMENT THERE, BUT I
THINK THAT WHAT THEY FOUND IN
THE SOLDIER OTHER THAN THE
BULLETS IS, IN SOME WAYS, MORE
AMAZING.
>>IT IS INSANE.
>>IT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT
IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING
INSIDE NORTH KOREA --
>>AND THE PHOTO I'M ABOUT 
TO
SHOW YOU IS OF THE PARASITIC
WORMS SO IF YOU ARE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT I WANT
TO GIVE THAT WARNING, BUT WITH
THAT SAID, HERE IS A PHOTO OF
WHAT THE DOCTORS PULLED OUT OF
HIS INTESTINES.
THEY ALSO FOUND
OUT THAT HE IS SUFFERING FROM
HEPATITIS, IT'S A FORM OF
HEPATITIS THAT USUALLY SPREADS
FROM UNSANITARY HOSPITALS
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
>>WHEN THEY WE USE SYRINGES
THEY SHOULDN'T USE, NEEDLES,
ETC.
IT TURNS OUT THAT A
SHOCKING PERCENTAGE OF NORTH
KOREAN DEFECTORS HAVE PARASITIC
WORMS IN THEIR BODY.
PART OF THE
REASON IS THEY USE HUMAN MANURE
FOR FARMING, WHICH YOU AREN'T
SUPPOSED TO DO. AND THERE IS
EASY THINGS YOU CAN DO TO AVOID
THESE WORMS, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE
ANY MONEY, THEY HAVE NOTHING.
IN
ONE CASE THEY DID A STUDY OF
NORTH KOREAN DEFECTORS, AND OF
THE WOMEN THEY STUDIED, I THINK
IT WAS ALL WOMEN, SEVEN OUT OF
THE 17 HAD WORMS IN THEIR
BODIES, AND ABOUT 10% OF THE
DEFECTORS SO FAR HAVE HEPATITIS
B. IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T TAKE
NORMAL PRECAUTIONS THAT ANYWHERE
ELSE IN THE WORLD YOU WOULD
TAKE, BECAUSE NORTH KOREA IS
BASICALLY ONE GIANT
CONCENTRATION.
THERE'S 25
MILLION PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN
NORTH KOREA, THEY ARE HOSTAGES
TO KIM JONG-UN AND THE RULING
CLASS IN NORTH KOREA.
PEOPLE
LIKE THIS -- HIS LAST NAME IS
OH, WE DON'T KNOW HIS FIRST
NAME, WE KNOW IT ISN'T STEVE --
PEOPLE LIKE HIM ARE WILLING TO
WHISK THEIR LIVES TO GET OUT OF
THIS HELLHOLE.
NORTH KOREA IS
ONE OF THE MOST INTRACTABLE
PROBLEMS ON THE PLANET, YOU ARE
DAMNED IF YOU DO, DAMNED IF YOU
DON'T. IF YOU START HOSTILITIES
WITH THEM THEY CAN LAUNCH OTHER
MISSILES AND KILL MILLIONS AT A
BARE MINIMUM IN SOUTH KOREA, LET
ALONE THE 25 MILLION WHO WILL
GET HURT WHEN SOUTH KOREA,
JAPAN, THE UNITED STATES
COUNTERSTRIKE.
AND KILLING NORTH
KOREANS -- LINDSAY GRAHAM
RECENTLY FLIPPANTLY TALKED ABOUT
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
NO, YOU ARE
KILLING PEOPLE IN A
CONCENTRATION CAMP.
BOMBING THE
NORTH KOREANS IS TERRIBLE.
ON
THE OTHER HAND, THEY HAVE
ENSLAVED THESE PEOPLE FOR
DECADES.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
SUFFERING UNDER UNIMAGINABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES.
I LOVE TO DO
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITIQUES, NOT JUST
BLINDLY SAY THAT PERSON IS BAD
OR THAT SITUATION IS TERRIBLE,
AND NOT GIVE YOU AN ANSWER --
BUT NORTH KOREA IS A VERY
DIFFICULT SITUATION WITH NOT A
LOT OF GREAT ANSWERS.
I KNOW
THAT WAR IS NOT THE ANSWER, I
THINK THE ANSWER IS TO APPLY
EVERY KIND OF DIPLOMACY WE CAN
TO CHINA, WHICH IS THE ONLY
COUNTRY BASICALLY PROPPING UP
THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME.
AND BY
HOOK OR BY CROOK WE NEED TO GET
CHINA TO AGREE WITH US TO
SOMEHOW, WITHOUT HAVING THE
NORTH KOREANS LAUNCH, TAKE OUT
THE LEADERSHIP AND
FREE THOSE PEOPLE.
BUT IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT
PROBLEM.
