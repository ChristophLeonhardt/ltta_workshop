this Sunday will mark a year since women took to the streets around the world for a march against something or other no unsure what the women all wore pink hats meant to represent their vaginas as a way to remind us that the vagina is the entrance into the womb which in Greek is called the hysteric which is where we get the word hysterical so in general when you see a woman wearing a hat that represents her vagina it's a good bet she's totally nuts witness crazy lady Ashley Judd reading this poem at the March on my bedsheets we don't actually choose to have our periods believe me if we could some of us would we don't like throwing away our favorite pairs of Underpants tell me why our pads and tampons still taxed ooh that was a brand name why our tampons and pads still taxed when viagra and Rogaine are not is your and really more than protecting the sacred messy part of my womanhood this is the blood stain on my jeans more embarrassing than the setting of your hair yes and speaking of hysteria on this day in 1919 Congress ratified the 18th amendment banning the sale of alcohol this was known as prohibition and it assured in an era of lawlessness and gangsterism known as the Roaring Twenties that was also the result of another women's movement the temperance movement which was led by this woman Carrie nation who used to go into saloons and bust them up with an axe so she didn't need a pink hat to remind us she was hysterical she just was before that right around this time of year in 1692 a group of girls in Massachusetts began spreading the false accusations that led to the Salem witch trials which in turn led to the wrongful deaths of some 25 people two of them children who died in prison the incident is one of the most famous instances of what's known as mass hysteria from the Greek word hysteric uterus which were reminded of whenever we see a woman marching with a pink hat the moral of these stories is that whenever large groups of women gather together and start screaming about anything everyone who is in any way connected to government should stop doing whatever they're doing and lie low until they go away don't have trials don't pass constitutional amendments and most importantly don't start firing people for things they may or may not have done 30 years ago unfortunately it's a little hard to get government to take this advice because a lot of people in government are men and whenever men get anywhere near someone with a vagina they tend to behave like this so basically due to vaginas were all doomed trigger warning I'm

it must be your first upside purchase $600 minimum purchase required see the site for complete details upside calm okay I know that's a lot of stuff to talk about at the beginning but you know I want to talk about this what's happening in this me to movement and this attack on the comedian what's his name Aziz Ansari I'm sorry okay now look I know that I I make fun about women and the reason is the teasing women is my life this is the project of my life what I'm it's what it's my life's work it's what I'm here to do but the fact is I feel Rimon are really ill served and are caught in a double bind women all studies show this study show and they say is that women are more conformist than men but I don't think that's the right way to put it actually in my experience of women it's not that women are more conformist it is that they are more sensitive to social pressure that they are more likely to say you know this is what's going on these are the morals of the society I'm in I will fulfill that role and men can go off a little bit on their own and I don't mean by the way when I say men I mean men I don't mean boys a lot of people say you know well Millennials feel this way yeah let them grow up a little bit and let them become men and then they'll see that sometimes they're going to break away from what everybody says they're gonna go the wrong way I mean I'm a guy who you know every day somebody calls me racist every day somebody calls me sex or somebody calls me a name I don't care I am going to say what I think is true and go the way that I go that's because I'm a guy okay I'm I'm a man that is the way men frequently behave but women tend to want to blend in and be part of the society they're in so what's the problem the problem is the only voices that they are likely to hear in the larger society or feminist voices why because if you're on TV if you're a woman on TV what are you not doing you're not at home you're not building a home for your family you're not taking care of your kids and you know when you see a news lady on TV and she's got and you just saw her pregnant two months ago and now she's back on TV somebody is being paid to take care of her kids okay and feminism feminism has shut down anybody who says well wait a minute you know if you have a kid maybe you got to take care of them kids need their mothers they need their mothers they need fathers too but in a different way when lit when kids are little they need mothers and nobody will say it right because when you say it especially if it's me they'll shut you down any way they can well you're a man you have no right to speak you're white you have no right to speak you're old you're out of it you're not together so so you never hear that voice you you never are getting pressured except always always always from one side it's always one side the feminist side that you are getting in anybody who speaks against it will be shut down even if it's a woman and if it's a woman who says who says you know hey you know I'm taking care of my kids I'm in my home I'm building a home for my family so that they have a place a base to work out of you're not gonna hear from her at all you're not gonna hear from her she's not gonna be on TV she's not gonna be writing she's doing something important instead of what I'm doing right now right she's going to be doing shaping actual lives and building actual futures and creating an actual home which is the central role of people in human life everything else is just to support that role so they so you only are hearing this one side and I'm not here to tell anybody how to live I am just saying that if you know I see these bumper stickers bumper sticker says good girls don't make history and I think history history history is just one long line of people killing each other that's what you know leftists are always saying you white people you came in and you took the land away from the indigenous people yeah you know what we interrupted them doing we interrupted them taking the land away from each other that's what history is history is people taking land away from each other enslaving the people they capture and killing them and then building their own society the only thing about the Europeans base societies is they really work well so not only do we get to kill everybody but then we get an iPhone that's the that's the improvement that we get because they were killing people before we got here now we kill people now we have actually have a more peaceful society than we've ever had before so being part of history is not that big a deal being part of being on TV may not be that big a deal these are things that society is constantly constantly telling you that you should do and one of the that has happened in our society is that the standard of sexual morality since the 60s has changed so drastically that a woman who goes on a date is basically expected expected to especially by the third date to have sex with the guy she's with and now we start to see all these women coming out in this me to movement who maybe feel like hey you know what that system really so to speak screwed me that system did not do that well for me so now we have this thing with this comedian now I have to be honest I the only thing I know about Aziz Ansari is I listen to a bit of his book modern romance I didn't find it that entertaining so I stopped but I hear he's very funny and he's a lefty and he's some kind of brown skinned person so that so he has all the lefty credentials the in fact let's let's have a look at him selling feminism on the Letterman Show here he is putting out his feminist cred on the on the David Letterman Show I feel like if you do believe that if you believe that men and women have equal rights if someone asks your feminist you have to say yes because that is how words work like you can't be like oh yeah I'm a doctor that primarily does diseases of the skin oh so you're a dermatologist oh no that's way too aggressive word no no no not at all not at all yeah and this is another test okay you're feminists if you go to a jay-z and Beyonce concert and you're not like I feel like Beyonce should get 23 percent less money than jay-z also I don't think Beyonce should have the right to vote and why is Beyonce singing and dancing shouldn't she make Jay a steak I'm sure he's very tired after walking and rapping those two songs you know IIIi oh I define myself as an anti-feminist I am anti-feminist I am an individualist I believe everybody should do what they want but that doesn't mean your choices are right or that your choices are good for you or that your choices are gonna give you a happy life and that when you know when you get older and you've been on TV all these years and your kids are saying hey how come you didn't take care of me where were you when I was a kid how come like the nanny was taking care of me maybe that's not gonna be - great later life maybe you're gonna find out that you did something meaningless talk on TV when you could have been doing something meaningful like raising children and fashioning their lives and giving them a mother that is gonna stick with them forever until the day they die so anyway on the website I think was called babe calm an anonymous woman I mean this is insane an anonymous woman came out and said she had a bad date with the sky with this comedian she they she met him at the Emmys they texted back and forth they went out on a date he took her home he was it sounded to me like he was clumsy and an overly aggressive there was some oral sex involved not gonna go into all the details but ultimately shit she said I don't want to do this he put her in an uber and send her home he sounded very clumsy like you know he thought one thing was going on she thought another thing was going on she is reacted by saying it we went out to there and afterwards we ended up engaging in sexual activity this is Ansari said this which by all indications was completely consensual and the next day I got a text from her saying that although it may have seemed okay upon further reflection she felt uncomfortable it was true and it so he does you know he feels bad about it he says it was true that everything did seem okay to me so when I heard that it was not the case for her I was surprised and concerned I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process which she had said this didn't stop her from coming out anonymously which is just I mean one of the most basic rights is to face your accuser and accusing him of doing all this stuff so now the left which sold to women relentlessly sold this new sexual morality to women especially feminists who should be just like men you have just as much right to sexes men you have just as right to be unfeeling and have an endless you know we shouldn't you know because women because women are more affected by social constructs that's why you hear women saying don't slut shame me don't fat shame me don't you know a beauty shame you don't you don't hear men saying that you know do I care whether you racists shame me or sexist no I mean I don't care but that's that's what women are doing and of course the thing is some shame is there for a reason you feel shame because you treated yourself badly you feel shame or guilt because you did something wrong so when you take all those things away you're just acting in a vacuum without any moral instruction whatsoever and you're gonna make mistakes so now the left is complaining here is Ashleigh Banfield the CNN crime reporter coming out and saying that this woman has destroyed has set the me to movement back if you're lucky there's a really good chance that you're not going to experience the toxic work environment that the rest of us have endured and that is because of the remarkable progress being made against the Harvey Weinstein's and the Kevin Spacey's of the world the me2 movement has righted a lot of wrongs and it has made your career path much smoother and here's where I'm guessing it's gonna be a long career path you're 23 what a gift yet you look that gift horse in the mouth and chiseled away at that powerful movement with your public accusation and I'm gonna repeat this because it's important if you were sexually assaulted go to the cops if you were sexually harassed jeopardizing your work speak up and speak out loud but by your own descriptions that is not what happened you had an unpleasant date and you did not leave that is on you finally finally somebody said this I said this several months ago where I said you know if you if somebody breaks the law report it to the police if they violate the rules of their the place where they work or the club that they belong to throw them out if not slap them and move on that's on you and finally now they left the saying this but this is another one of these torpedoes that the left has fired at Donald Trump that has turned around and blown up their own ship and the reason is Donald Trump they were always accusing people on the right and especially religious people of hypocrisy they don't really know what the word hypocrisy means they think it means sinning when you think something is sinful that's not what hypocrisy means hypocrisy means preaching one thing and living in a totally different way Donald Trump hasn't done this that that he was a billionaire who ran beauty pageants and prided himself on sleeping not only with every woman he could get close to but with other people's wives I mean that's so every we hear about him doesn't doesn't touch him doesn't affect him Michelle Michelle Goldberg / knucklehead row in The New York Times wrote this piece saying in retrospect the dynamics of the clinton-era culture Wars seemed blissfully simple pitting a sexually libertarian left against an aggressively prudish right it is a cosmic irony a cosmic irony that twenty years later it is conservatives who finally killed off the last remaining unspoken rules about presidential sexual ethics so it's Donald Trump's fault that they've gotten caught with a bad system it's a bad system and Heather McDonald one of the great writers I say this all the time she's one of the great reporters in the in the country she's at over at City Journal terrific magazine she wrote this piece at City Journal about policing sexual ethics and she was on TV explaining some of the things she was talking about how the left has brought us to this past where women are exposed men and women have different biological drives their libidos are different and we had a set of norms that restrained the male libido norms of gentlemen leanness and courtesy and chivalry and we had a default for premarital sex for females that was know and that gave females the power to say yes but they didn't have to negotiate with the male libido at every instance of some drunken coupling sexual liberation threw that all out and said men and women should go mano-a-mano on the sexual battlefield they're equal in their desires equal in their responses to casual sex and it turns out when you set the default at yes for premarital sex a lot of women have a hard time negotiating and no and instead of recognizing that we've sort of screwed up the default settings and are working against biology women are blaming the patriarchy when the opposite is the case that that's it exactly they're blaming the patriarchy when the opposite is the case it is feminism that led them to this pretty pass and feminism that so in wraps them and envelops them that they can't get out of that social order because there's no one saying what I'm saying to you right now and I'll conclude this in just a second but first we've got to talk about the post office because we're here because we're not at the post office and I love the post office the post off has been my life as a writer when I started out the post office was all you had it was your link to every magazine your link to every submission you waited at the mailbox you went to the post office with

stamped calm and enter Clavin and you can get everything you need from the post office in your computer stamps comm and enter Clavin let me finish this off and then we'll get to Owen Benjamin the comedian the non-pc comedian let me just finish this off by by talking about the fact that women because of because of feminism women are now in a position where they have to rebel against the again against the societal norms it is it is natural to women to sort of follow those norms it is time for women individually to create them you can't wait for the world to fix itself you have to fix you you are responsible for fixing you you want to live a better life start treating your body like a woman's body I'm saying this because I'm an old guy I've got my woman I'm not looking for anything I'm not on the run I'm not on the prowl I don't want anything from anybody I want you to live your best life that's all I want is all I've got no I've got no skin in the game that's that's what makes that's what gives me the power to say this you want to live a better life start treating your body like a woman's body the reason there is a price for admission into a woman's body is because the consequences are so high you get pregnant you're gonna have a choice between having that baby or having an abortion either one of those may not work out well I mean the baby look the baby's gonna be a beautiful new person and that's great the abortion you're gonna live with for the rest of your life so you know that there should be a very very high price of admission that price should be commitment and it shouldn't be because some guy just happens to be excited that day has happened to have a couple of drinks happens to want what he wants you know you have to make that decision you have to setup the rules and if each person does that if each woman does that then that will become the social norm so maybe instead of listening to Meghan Kelly who has a baby in his back on it the air a week later maybe maybe you should be listening to God maybe should be listening to your pastor maybe you should be listening to the wisdom of the ages which has worked for thousands of years maybe you should turn off the TV and consult your own heart all right we have on Benjamin the comedian coming up but we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come on over the Daily wire calm you can listen to the rest but if only if only if only you would subscribe I mean I know I know what you're waking up tomorrow and saying if only I had subscribed I could have been on the conversation at 5:30 p.m. Eastern 2:30 Pacific wherever the heck we are and I could have sent questions into the mailbag and for a lousy hundred bucks I could add a subscription for an entire year and the amazing leftist ears tumblr that steven crowder can only Envy from afar wishing that he had a tumblr like this to drink left his tears out yet Owen Benjamin coming out to stay with us all right Owen Benjamin is a stand-up comedian and actor a podcast host a pianist he is never afraid to share his non-pc perspective which is quite hilarious and also just incredibly refreshing his podcast is called why didn't they laugh and you can find that on itunes and soundcloud you can also find episodes on his youtube channel just titled Owen Benjamin along with a bunch of different content the important thing is you can find him on Twitter at Owen Benjamin but if you want to get tickets to his tour to his comedy tours go on www.ppsd.com a zine the level of pressure to conform and to shut up that you are under I mean you've been banned from comedy clubs is that fair to my stance on trans children which is that it's child abuse yeah I wasn't allowed to do a gig at UConn and then I I lost my agent I was at CAA and I dropped me because because of that and I know that you probably experienced some of this stuff as a writer as well where it's like you can't like I can be clean I don't have to swear out of respect for certain audiences but I can't change my thoughts like and I have to think clearly and if they tell me I have to lie about fundamental things that I don't believe I can't be funny so I did I had to face this struggle and unfortunately I came out on the other side with uh with it's it's really fun being on the other side and just being able to say whatever you want and my and people have been so supportive and I'm having a blast with it I mean it really is a quandary for people like us because I mean I've lost publishing contracts I've lost film deals I I calculate I calculate that my opinions have cost me in the millions of dollars there's really no question about it but our words are all we've got I mean the things that our perspective is all we have to sell and if we're not telling the truth about it what are we I mean we're basically worthless exactly it's just taken out the fundamental engine of what makes us valuable in the first place you know and the craziest thing the thing that gave me the creeps about the Hollywood world is uh they would be like oh you're you're terrible like what you say is is really bad and I'd look at them in the eye I'm talking famous people there are still my friends but secretly apparently now where I'd be like do you think of five-year-olds trance and do you think they should put be put on hormone blockers like yes or no do you think that and they're like no no I'm like so what exactly did I say that you have a problem with and and then I realized it when you're going after power acquisition and not ethics and morality or the good joke or just you know your purpose in life you have to basically sign a Faustian deal where you you just slide anywhere they want you to go and I'm like comedy can't exist that way and now as as a greedy capitalist I see that there's a massive underserved market I did a tweet where it was all the late-night host it got like 20 thousand retweets I think Shapiro retweeted a couple guys for tweeted it that you guys work with and it just had all the late-night host and I said every one of them endorsed the same candidate they all have the same views ladies and gentlemen comedy and when you see that it's become propaganda just anybody that just won't do that just won't be leftist there's just so many hungry people just looking to laugh you know with like family-oriented comedy comedy about you know it's a great time to be married there's never been a better time to just remarried with children and just you know and I almost feel like being a family guy and being Christian and being like you know hard-working is the new Punk like punk like people are like how dare you you're crazy man I can't believe you think that you know there's good and bad in the world it is really true that we are that I mean if the fact that at my age I'm part of the counterculture is one of the great ironies of my life I mean this is when I wanted to look like a banker and have a three-piece suit and you know you smoke a pipe and everything like listen instead I am the hippy of the modern world it's an it's an incredible irony I went from I went from hockey to rebel in a year same jokes you know I always did in it and it's like they keep talking about toxic masculinity I think there's a toxic femininity happening cuz cuz cuz comedy is usually a few years ahead of the curve because we're going for what makes people laugh and react we can't do the agenda stuff and maybe eight years ago I did a bit on how women are socialist and men are capitalist and you can see it in our groups where you know women protect a weak like if one girl sad I'll just I'll just do that very quickly I don't do the whole thing if one girl sad they're like Tina's sad liquor tears we're out of here I'm like if one guy is sad dude get away from hysteria bummer it is true where it's like he's the funniest put him on stage he's the fastest make him captain and women are like she's the prettiest tell everybody she has herpes it's true this safe space PC thing is motivated by this overindulgence of that and I think a lot of it comes from women hit a certain age without children so they try to baby the entire world and cuz because these instincts are good when you have one-year-old like my wife is it's phenomenal with that it's like ever it's about safety you know this kid everything he does is is great and just keep them away from the electric outlets and safety safety safety and that's awesome with the child it's not awesome when you're you know Chelsea Handler with a Twitter account it's like stop babying me I'm a grown up with my own house he's mean and so that's and now I I would do that and you know CIA loves it and all these movie stars love it and I'm hosting all these galas and all this stuff and the same jokes you know Patton Oswalt is retweeting me and then three years later I'm now enemy the enemy of the state with the same jokes and I'm like oh you guys have no consistency what's about power with you guys what is she I have to know this like what did they say when they got rid of me just that I'm being I I'm acting crazy on Twitter it's because I I said a name of a man and see it's almost like like Genesis where if you name something it becomes real we're all these people just keep being like oh we have to fight for children we have to fight for women it's like who's raping say a name you know and I there's this one guy this guy Jesse thorn and I read this article about him he has a six year old boy that he's saying as a girl and I was calling the boy grace and he's a big NPR host and he's in all the right circles and I'm Twitter I'm like are you planning on giving this kid hormone blockers and he was like the doctors are experts and they think you know whatever's right for grace and I'm like you're a monster yeah I'm like this is wrong this is child abuse and then I'm getting swarmed by blue checkmarks not even like trolls like people like best-selling authors are coming at me yeah and I just put him back down because I fortunately have a strong family I like my family's awesome and I my brothers up an arborist and I can just do tree work know I could make I could make 50 grand in a week and then the next week we make $20 an hour and and not much changes in my life and I was willing to do that full shift like I still do tree work with them all the time and and they couldn't dangle that carrot in front of me cuz I'm like man when you get rich you have the same nightmare is just on sheets with a higher thread count Julius Caesar took over the whole world he got a salad Nazi money's bad it just amplifies your purpose you know you're rich and a good person you can take your family to France that's right but it not just self is just self destruct so and my wife is so awesome and I'm and she's a stay-at-home mom but masters in engineering saw our son and really connected and wanted to stay home just like my mom was a professor quit to raise us and that's probably why I understand nuance and micro expressions in people's faces and I don't like a lot of these millennial kids and so that's what made me you know I said I was still calling myself a liberal and all my conservative friends are like it's weird buddy but every single you thing you say is conservative why are you calling yourself a liberal I know I know I see the shit yeah cuz that's the right answer right other good people okay I'm a liberal but you know I'm not into abortion and I bow i I don't like big government you know and it just that would list like everything I believe you're like oh no you're not at all a liberal and I'm like really and it's the Overton Window just flew off a cliff I mean they're self they're imploding like with this Twitter this big project Veritas and now they don't have a stance they're just power acquisition monsters you know great and uh and now they're like oh it's a private company they get to do what they want you know and I'm like remember that when a gay guy wants a cake I think that's the big difference is that the left will to acquire power and the right kind of has to stick with their guns even in bad times well you know that in the long run that always wins like Ben Shapiro is now a feminist and he always was you know but you just don't see it until things get this maddening where it's like treat women right you're a feminist it's like get married have kids know that they're different and deserve respect don't just sleep with strangers you know I come with these like reckless aborting feminists you just end up sad with a silly hat so you know I always hear from left as well you know right-wingers just aren't funny and I always say right-wingers on fine because left us have no sense of humor I mean that's the you know the minute you start laughing at them they they don't think it's funny but what I want to know is how did you now you get blacklisted you get sent away by CAA and people ask me this question all the time so I want to ask you how did you get through how did you move to the next phase what was what was the plan well well two things first real quick when people say people on the right aren't funny I don't think people realize how many massive movie stars and TV creators and comedians are actually not on the left but they don't say it because they don't want to jeopardize a billion dollars like I'm friends with some guys you know it's it's it's which is sad in a sense because I have a friend worth I don't know 300 million dollars and I'm more free than him yeah because I get to just be like ah now they're those feminine haired feminists is psychotic and he's like and I wish I could say that you have all the money like I'm alright so anyway um so how they get through it well I got to give props to Joe Rogan and dave rubin because you know I've done Fallon I've done Leno I've done all these shows and when when you get blacklisted they take away all your ability of speaking to the public in any big forum so one thing that happens is the Streisand effect you know my youtube went from three thousand to seventy thousand and to two months where it's just like and people respected that I stood up for something and so people came to me and then Joe Rogan had me on twice in a in two months and then Dave Rubin had me on and steven crowder i became very close with and we did a lot of sketches together and you know Dave Smith who has the libertarian podcast you know stefan molyneux had me on like all these people that that um they I they just were like tell your story and I'm like thank you very much and I just kind of reshaped my career and I thought I was gonna lose everything but thankfully for patreon and super chats on YouTube and just these little things that I'm now self producing another special that I'm shooting in my hometown and it's never been better yeah I mean and my wife tells me how much happier I seem and she has pride in what I did you know and it's just it's just a good time to be a comedian it's a so amazing art yeah it's art it is art and it's not propaganda right and it's not about getting you know I said something on Twitter that some people scared Ronald's like you know the difference between propaganda and comedy is comedy makes people laugh propaganda makes people clap right you just laugh cuz it's funny Stephen Colbert says something in people clap just like a Stalinist you know halt you know they're just scared to be the first person to stop clapping and and and you know the marketplace of ideas is just like the marketplace of everything and and they will fail and they will fail with no spirit left and just like the Gulag Archipelago of jokes I don't think the states I don't think the stakes are high Solzhenitsyn's time but it's a similar type of soul-crushing March to your own demise you know their eyes don't shine like they used to yep it knows no question about this you know I mean we our old friend uncle Jesus said the truth will make you free and he knew a thing or two obviously I can see I can see looking at you that it's a it's a it's a liberating experience and I know it for a fact it's unreal yeah that was agnostic for a while and as my son was being born and I just prayed very hard and I couldn't go back from that experience right and so that's what got me back into Christianity because you know you pray in in turbulence you know and then you kind of forget but when your son's on being born in his heart stops and you pray to God like you beg God there's really once the plane lands there's really no going back from that and so it's been out that's been a wonderful experience it's a beautiful thing hey I got to go on but it's really nice talking to you and you get tickets for your tours at wwg pianist com is that is that right yes AB 1690 piano I'm probably I'm trying to be very accurate nice well come back again I'd like to talk to you again really good talking to you man thanks a lot I mean it's he's funny or sitting down then then every guy on late-night you know is lecturing us Jimmy Kimmel crying and I have to I have to tell this one joke that I have I told the parking spot joke that the a guy is a guy's going to his first his first job interview and he's going around the block and he can't find a parking space and he says God please I need this job so much please please give me a parking space if you give me a parking space I will I will tithe myself I'll give 10% of everything I make to the church I'll go to church every Sunday I'll be so loyal please just give me a parking space and a car right in front of them pulls out of a parking space leaving them in an open spot he says oh never mind god there's one so so oh and when he realized what he prayer prayed he had to be to have integrity and stick with it all right let us have sexual follies I have to find my oh this is this is I just love this story I just love this story some is you know we were talking about the women's March we started talking about the women's March and now some of the women are saying you can't wear the vagina hats because some women are men and don't have vaginas and this is this is of course this incredibly creamy look if you're a woman who thinks you're a man that's a very painful situation you're a man who thinks she's a woman that's a very painful situation but it doesn't make you a woman it doesn't make you a man you're not you're not and even I'm sorry but even if you have an operation god bless you do whatever you want you know live your your best life it's fine with me but you are a woman when you grow up as a girl and you become a woman and you go through that experience that's an experience that is a lived experience that you have it doesn't happen in your mind it happens in your body and your mind and your soul and so so now they are there are actually people who are claiming that if a man will not date a man who says he's a woman that he is what do they call it transphobic they always have a good name for something this there was this BBC reality show called Celebrity Big Brother and one of the people on it was talking to a former singer named Ginuwine and Ginuwine turned down a kiss from fellow contestant India will it be a TV journalist who had transitioned from male to female well first of all no he didn't he didn't he's still a male he may have had any operation in the world and we can call him find some name for that but it is it is kind of comical it is kind of comical to me that two years ago five years ago we were arguing about whether if homosexuality was moral and people like me were saying listen it doesn't hurt anybody live the life you're gonna live if that's the way you have sex that's fine and now we're being told that heterosexuality is essentially a form of bigotry heterosexuality being attracted to the person you're attracted to who happens to be women is somehow an act of bigotry the big thing about Trant transgenderism is that it is a completely unimportant issue it's an issue that was brought forward by a left that seeks to find ways to curtail what you can think and what you can say that's all it's about it's all it's about we do the as a nation we do not need to address the fact that some people are confused about their gender as a nation we can ignore it completely let me tell you something you go down to City Hall in LA there's a tent town of homeless people people sleeping out in the street when I was in New York and it was 15 below zero I mean it was freezing cold there were guys out on the street with their dogs veterans wrapped up in pillows with little signs saying I'm a vet here's my dog give me some money that's a problem that's a problem that we're all gonna have to address or you know left and right we're all gonna have to figure out a way to get people off the street the fact that some people don't know what bathroom to use and are confused about their gender it just is not important it is not an important issue but it's all about it is all about constructing this world of silence this cone of silence so that only the feminist perspective can come out only that social pressure can be brought to bear and it's women especially who suffer from this because men will break away guys like Owen Benjamin will break away but women are wrapped in this cone of social norms that is created by a massive massive corporate machine that includes the networks that includes the late-night comedy shows that's silent Twitter Google that's silenced any voice that rises up and speaks against them they are out there doing this to get you and especially women there especially after women the conversation
