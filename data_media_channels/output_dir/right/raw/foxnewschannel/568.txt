00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:19,835
PROTESTERS DESCENDING, THEY ALL

00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:22,671

00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:26,074
SUSAN COLLINS OFFICE.

19
00:00:26,074 --> 00:00:26,975
I DON’T KNOW WHY THEY WERE

20
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:28,043
ALLOWED TO HANG OUT IN THE

21
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:29,645
CAPITAL, THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

22
00:00:29,645 --> 00:00:30,512
THROWN OUT.

23
00:00:30,512 --> 00:00:32,314
HOW DOES WHITE HOUSE FEEL

24
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:32,648
TONIGHT?

25
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:34,683
>> WE ARE SO PROUD OF BRETT

26
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:35,884
KAVANAUGH AND ASHLEY.

27
00:00:35,884 --> 00:00:36,718
THEY WENT OUT THERE TONIGHT,

28
00:00:36,718 --> 00:00:38,287
THEY SPOKE FROM THE HEART, AND

29
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:40,656
THEY SENT A VERY POWERFUL

30
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:41,256
MESSAGE.

31
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:42,691
BRETT SAID HE’S GOING TO FIGHT.

32
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:44,059
HE’S GOING TO STAND STRONG.

33
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:45,294
HE’S NOT GOING TO BE INTIMIDATED

34
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:45,294
HE’S NOT GOING TO BE INTIMIDATED

35
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:48,063
BY THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE

36
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:51,667
PLACING FALSE CLAIMS ON HIM.

37
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,502
HE IS STRONG IN DEFENDING HIS

38
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:54,703
CHARACTER AND HIS INTEGRITY, AND

39
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:54,703
CHARACTER AND HIS INTEGRITY, AND

40
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:55,704
I THINK THAT WAS SUCH AN

41
00:00:55,704 --> 00:00:56,672
IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR THE

42
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:59,041
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO HEAR TONIGHT.

43
00:00:59,041 --> 00:00:59,041
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO HEAR TONIGHT.

44
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,943
THE PAIN THAT THEY ARE GOING

00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:01,977
THROUGH, THE VILE THREATS IN OUR

46
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:01,977
THROUGH, THE VILE THREATS IN OUR

47
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:05,381
FAMILY, AND THE MERE FACT THAT

48
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:07,049
THE DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING

49
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,085
POLITICS WITH THIS FAMILY, WITH

50
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:10,786
THIS MAN’S LIFE, SOMEONE WHO HAS

00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:12,388
DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO PUBLIC

53
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:13,923
SERVICE, LAURA, AND I HAVE TO

54
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:14,857
TELL YOU, WHEN YOU LISTEN TO

55
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:18,661
THESE DEMOCRATS, AND WHEN THEY

56
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,630
SAY, THE VERDICT IS INCOME OF

57
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,298
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS GUILTY, THEY

58
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:23,466
BELIEVE HER, THEN WHY THE HECK

59
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:25,301
ARE WE HAVING A HEARING IF

60
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:26,836
THEY ARE BELIEVING HER AND NOT

61
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,838
EVEN GIVING BRETT KAVANAUGH THE

62
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:32,208
FAIR PROCESS THAT HE DESERVES,

63
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:35,478
ESPECIALLY AFTER SIX WEEKS THAT

64
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:32,942
THEY HAD THESE LENGTHY HEARINGS,

65
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:37,847
THAT THEY’VE ASKED HIM TO OVER

66
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,782
1,000 QUESTIONS, AND YET THE

67
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:44,287
DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO TRY TO

68
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:45,055
DESTROY BRETT KAVANAUGH’S

69
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:45,455
REPUTATION.

70
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:47,257
>> Laura: MERCEDES, WHAT IS

71
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:48,058

73
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:49,826
WAY ALL MY SOURCES, IT’S NOT SO

74
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:52,863
MUCH SUSAN COLLINS WHO IS

75
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:53,296
WAVERING HERE.

76
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:57,300
I THINK SHE HAS BEEN SOLIDIFIED

77
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,935
IN HER VIEW IN FAIRNESS, GIVEN

78
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:00,103
THE ACTIVISTS THAT HAVE BEEN

79
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,838
INVOLVED HERE AND WHAT HAPPENED

80
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:02,472
OVER THE LAST WEEK OF MY

81
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:04,675
DELAYING MR. TRY TO GET -- WAIT

82
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:06,276
FOR THIS REPORT TO COME OUT.

83
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:07,544
WHAT’S THE MESSAGE FOR HIM

84
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,646
TONIGHT GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN?

85
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:10,646
TONIGHT GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN?

86
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:12,482
>> I THINK THE METHOD FOR ALL

87
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,018
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS IS

88
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:16,153
THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH STANDS

89
00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:16,653
READY TO TESTIFY.

90
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:17,721
HE’S READY TO CLEAR HIS NAME.

91
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,023
HE WAS READY TO DO THAT LAST

92
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:20,324
WEEK.

93
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:22,326
>> Laura: MERCEDES, WITH ALL

RESPECT FOR YOU.

96
00:02:25,963 --> 00:02:29,667
I DON’T THINK IT IS POSSIBLE FOR

97
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:29,667
I DON’T THINK IT IS POSSIBLE FOR

98
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,769
BRETT KAVANAUGH TO GO UP THERE,

99
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:32,970
AND THIS ATMOSPHERE, AND BE

100
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,307
EXPECTED -- WE KNOW HE SAYS HE

101
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:36,941
CATEGORICALLY DENIES THIS.

102
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:39,543
HE HAD SAID THIS REPEATEDLY, AND

103
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:39,543
HE HAD SAID THIS REPEATEDLY, AND

104
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:40,845
LETTERS ENDED STATEMENTS

105
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:41,178
TONIGHT.

106
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:42,947
I THINK IT’S A MISTAKE TO KEEP

107
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:43,881
GIVING INTO THESE TACTICS.

108
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:47,385
THE TACTICS OF THE LEFT ARE COME

109
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:47,385
THE TACTICS OF THE LEFT ARE COME

110
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:49,287
ALIKE -- THIS IS LIKE POLITICAL

111
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,289
TERRORISM, INTIMIDATION,

112
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:52,056
EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL,

00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:52,790
EXTORTION, WE’VE ALL SEEN IT IN

DIFFERENT FORMS IN OUR LIVES.

115
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,229
THIS IS HIDEOUS WHAT THEY HAVE

116
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:05,636
DONE.

117
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:06,304
YOU NEED A LITTLE MORE RIGHT

SENATORS ON CAPITOL HILL.

123
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:09,574
THIS IS BEYOND THE PALE.

THIS IS ALL THE DEMOCRATS ARE

TRYING TO DO TO BUY TIME.

147
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:25,657
THEY WANT TO FIGURE OUT, WHAT

148
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:26,825
OTHER STORY THEY CAN TRY TO

149
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:27,859

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

154

155
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:39,638
THIS.

156
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:41,273
THE PROOF OF IT IS, THE SENATORS

157
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:41,273
THE PROOF OF IT IS, THE SENATORS

158
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:43,675
DON’T EVEN WANT TO ASK

SPEAK OF THE SENATE MAJORITY LER

CALLING THIS A SMEAR CAMPAIGN

171
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:59,024
IS A SMALL DOG WHISTLE TO THE

172
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:00,292
BASE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,

173
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:02,261
MAY BE TRAUMA SPACE, TALKING

186
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:20,379
I THINK WHAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS

187
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:24,583
ASKING FOR IS A FAIR PROCESS.
