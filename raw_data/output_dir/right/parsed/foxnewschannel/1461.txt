PRESIDENT AND JOHN BOLTON AND
SEAN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
YOU SAID A COUPLE DAYS AGO, I
THINK THIS IS GOING IT HAPPEN.
GIVEN THE BREAKING NEWS, DO YOU
STILL STAND BY THAT?
>> WELL FIRST OF ALL, I'M A
LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE
INTERVIEW NOW WITH YOU BECAUSE
APPARENTLY THIS IS WHAT'S GOING
TO HELP DETERMINE THE OUTCOME.
LOOK, I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S A
MASTER NEGOTIATOR.
HE'S THE AUTHOR OF THE ART OF
THE DEAL.
I DON'T KNOW WE'VE SEEN THE END
OF THE SUMMIT JUNE 12 BUT IN
LESS KYM  -- KIM JONG-UN MAKES
CONCESSIONS THERE WON'T BE A
MEETING.
HE WANTS TO BE SEEN AS A LEGIT
WORLD LEADER AND THE PRESIDENT
WON'T GIVE I AM TO HIM UNTIL HE
MAKES THE CONCESSION TO DUE
NUCLEARIZE THE NORTH KOREA
PENINSULA.
>> Martha: WHEN YOU SEE THE
PHOTOGRAPHS WITH MIKE POMPEO AND
KIM JONG-UN AND THE FRIENDLY HOP
SKIPPING OVER THE CURB AT THE
BLUE HOUSE WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN
LEADER, IT'S CLEAR KIM JONG-UN
WANTED TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION
OF THE SUMMIT BUT ME PRESIDENT
KEEPS REFERRING BACK TO THE
POSSIBILITY THE SECOND MEETING
WITH PRESIDENT XI IN CHINA IS
WHEN THINGS START TO FALL APART
AND WE'RE LEARNING THE
COMMUNICATION START TO BREAK
DOWN DAYS AGO.
YOUR THOUGHTS.
>> YOU HAD THREE HOSTAGES
RELEASED TO THE UNITED STATES IN
AN ACT OF GOOD FAITH AND THE
DISMANTLING OF A NUCLEAR SITE.
THOSE WERE CLEARLY DONE TO SHOW
THAT HE WAS TAKING THE RIGHT
STEPS BUT I THINK HE
OVERESTIMATED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
DESIRE TO HAVE THIS MEETING AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS PRETTY CLEAR
UNTIL HE SAW ADDITIONAL CONCRETE
STEPS AND CONCESSIONS THAT
SHOWED NORTH KOREA WAS TRULY
GOING TO DENUCLEAR THE PENINSULA
HE WASN'T GOING TO THE MEETING.
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART.
THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENT
TRUMP -- BANE  BY THE WAY,
BY THE WAY, FROM THE BEGINNING
SAID IF WE GET A DEAL, GREAT AND
IF WE DON'T, WE DON'T BUT
THERE'LL STILL BE AN
OPPORTUNITY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE IT CLEAR
THERE'LL BE CONDITIONS TO BE MET
AND HE'S PLAYED THEM PERFECTLY.
>> AND IN REGARD TO THE
INTERVIEW AND WHAT MIKE PENCE
SAID IN THE INTERVIEW LINED UP
WITH THINGS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID
PRIOR TO THAT THEY WANTED
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION.
THE PRESIDENT AT ONE POINT SAID
THEY DOESN'T WANT THE LIBYA
MODEL WHICH IS COMPLETE
DENUCLEARIZATION AND I THINK HE
WAS REFERRING TO MOAMMAR GADHAFI
WE'RE GETTING BRAND NEW
INFORMATION AND LIGHT BEING SHED
ON THE STATEMENT LEADER.
LEADER KIM JONG-UN FOCUSSED
EVERY EFFORT OWN THE MEETING AND
THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION DOES
NOT MATCH WITH THE WORLD'S
DESIRE.
IT APPEARS THEY'RE TRYING TO
RE-OPEN THE DOOR AND BEFORE THEY
I WANT TO REPLAY THAT BECAUSE
THE MEDIA HAD A FIELD DAY WITH
THE LETTER THAT CAME OUT AND THE
RESPONSE SAYING THIS HAD BLOWN
UP IN THE PRESIDENT'S FACE AND
HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID.
>> THE PRESIDENT -- HE WAS AT
THE END ZONE DANCE AND WE
WEREN'T AT THE 50-YARD LINE YET.
>> IT'S AMAZING THE
ADMINISTRATION ARE SHOCKED THE
NORTH KOREANS ARE ACTING AS
NORTH KOREA ACT.
>> HE MUST BE HAVING A GIGGLE
FIT.
THE LETTER CHUMMING UP LIKE A
VALENTINE TO KIM JONG-UN,
REALLY, REALLY?
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK,
SEAN?
>> I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN THE
END OF THIS.
I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOWS
HOE TO NEGOTIATE BETTER THAN
ANYBODY BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS
BACKGROUND.
I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN THE END
OF THIS.
HE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING, IF I
CAN MAKE IT WORK, GREAT, IF NOT
I'LL WALKY.
HE'S SHOWN HE CAN WALK AWAY.
NOW CHAIRMAN KIM HAS TO COME
BACK TO THE TABLE AND I THINK
WE'LL SEE ADDITIONAL
CONCESSIONS.
MY GUESS IS THERE'S A LOT OF
CHAPTERS TO BE WRITTEN IN THE
BOOK BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
SHOWN HE CAN WALK AWAY FROM A
BAD DEAL.
CHAIRMAN KIM UNDERSTANDS UNTIL
HE GETS THE MEETING HE'S SEEN AS
A THIRD-RATE DICT TATAR AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP WON'T GRANT HIM
THAT UNTIL HE EXHIBITS REAL
CONCESSIONS AHEAD OF TIME.
I KNOW DIRECTOR POMPEO, AND JOHN
BOLTON AND PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND I
THINK SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS
COMING OUT ARE GETTING TOO OUT
IN FRONT OF A STORY THAT HASN'T
SEEN THE END YET.
>> Martha: YOU MENTIONED VICE
PRESIDENT PENCE IN THE GROUP.
DO YOU THINK HE STEPPED OUT OF
LINE IN THE INTERVIEW?
>> NO, AND I APOLOGIZE WITH ALL
DUE RESPECT TO THE VICE
PRESIDENT.
THAT'S MY FAULT.
THEY'RE A GREAT TEAM AND KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
THIS SAY LONG GAME.
THEY ALL -- THIS IS A LONG GAME
AND KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND
WON'T GRANT NORTH KOREA A FACE
TO FACE MEETING THAT GIVES THEM
LEGITIMACY UNTIL THEY MAKE THE
CONCESSIONS NECESSARY.
REAL CONCRETE THINGS.
