AXIOS REPORTS THAT TRUMP MIGHT
FIRE SECRETARY OF STATE REX
TILLERSON, AND HE MAY GIVE THE
JOB TO WHO?
CIA DIRECTOR MIKE
POMPEO.
THIS IS ALL RUMOR BUT
YOU'VE HEARD IT MULTIPLE PLACES,
IN THE WAKE OF THE STATEMENT YOU
ALL HEARD REPORTED, WHICH IS
THAT REX TILLERSON REFERRED TO
THE PRESIDENT AS AN EFFING
MORON, AND REALLY BEFORE THAT IF
YOU ARE PAYING ATTENTION,
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STRIFE
BETWEEN THEM.
AXIOS BROKE THE
STORY, THEY SAY THE RELATIONSHIP
IS BEYOND REPAIR --
>>WHO IS HE, VINCE VAUGHN?
>>I ROCKED VEGAS --
>>MAY BE A JEALOUSY THING.
NEXT, THEY SAID --
>>DO YOU BUY IT?
>>DO I BUY WHAT?
>>THAT HE'S GOING TO FIRE REX
TILLERSON?
>>YEAH.
FIRST OF ALL, TRUMP IS
UNPREDICTABLE, SO HE COULD DO
ANYTHING.
HE COULD FIRE HIMSELF.
>>GOD, I HOPE HE DOES.
>>WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT?
I
THINK DEFINITELY THE THING THAT
BOTHERED HIM WAS HIM NOT DENYING
THAT HE CALLED HIM A MORON
OUTRIGHT.
THAT WOULD DRIVE
ANYBODY CRAZY.
SECOND OF ALL,
YES, TILLERSON DOMINATED THE
MEDIA CYCLE, OR THE NEWS CYCLE,
AND TRUMP LIVES ON THAT.
THAT'S
ALL HE CARES ABOUT.
AND OF
COURSE HE GOT BEATEN OUT BY THAT
GUY SO HE WANTS TO GET RID OF
HIM.
I DON'T WANT THAT BY
STEALING MY TV TIME.
THAT'S THE LEVEL TRUMP OPERATES
ON.
NO DEEPER.
>>HE CALLED TRUMP A FUCKING
MORON, ABSOLUTELY.
>>ONE OF THE THINGS OF WHAT HE
DID IT, HE CALLED HIM A MORON
BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S AFGHANISTAN
STRATEGY, AND SPECIFICALLY THE
WAY WE'VE CHANGED IT IS THE
OVERTURNED REQUIREMENT THAT THE
TROOPS BE IN THE AREA OF ENEMY
FORCES BEFORE THEY FIRED.
OUR
HEAD DIPLOMAT IN THE COUNTRY IS
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS, AND
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
ALLOWING OUR JETS TO BOMB PEOPLE
WHATEVER THEY WANT, SO WHEN YOU
LOOK AT WHAT TILLERSON IS TRYING
TO DO AND WATCH HOW THE
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IS MAKING IT
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DO HIS
DIPLOMACY JOB, I CAN SEE WHY YOU
THINK THIS GUY IS A MORON AND
YOU GET ANGRY.
BUT INSTEAD OF
TALKING ABOUT POLICY WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT THE NEWS CYCLE,
THE PRIORITIES ARE SO OFF.
BUT
TILLERSON, HIS PRIORITIES ARE
CORRECT, HE CALLED HIM A MORON
FOR A GOOD REASON, OUR
AFGHANISTAN STRATEGY IS KILLING
PEOPLE BY THINK I'M DEFENDING
THE EXXON MOBIL SECRETARY OF
STATE, THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AT,
BUT HE'S AN ADULT.
>>IT'S SO WEIRD THAT I'M ON THE
SIDE OF REX TILLERSON.
>>WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO HAVE THIS
NEW POLICY IN AFGHANISTAN THAT
CAUSED HIM TO BE CALLED A MORON?
>>MATTIS IS PRETTY HAPPY ABOUT
IT.
MAD DOG.
>>TILLERSON WOULD ALSO BE
REFERRING TO MATTIS IS A MORON
TOO, BECAUSE HE'S FOR THIS
POLICY ALSO.
>>POSSIBLY.
>>AT LEAST THAT WAS BASED ON
POLICY.
>>IN CONTEXT I'M LIKE, YES, GO
TILLERSON.
>>HERE ARE THE REASONS MIKE
POMPEO MIGHT BE A REPLACEMENT,
THEY SAY HE'S CLOSE TO TRUMP, HE
DELIVERS THE DAILY PRESS BRIEF
TO TRUMP, HE'S NOT A SHOWBOAT,
HE WOULD TAKE THE JOB BECAUSE
IT'S A LOGICAL NEXT STEP, IT'S
ALL HE HASN'T DONE BESIDES
PRESIDENT, ESSENTIALLY, HE HAS
CREDIBILITY WITH WORLD LEADERS
BECAUSE HE WOULD ACTUALLY BE
ABLE TO BE IN THE PRESIDENT'S
EAR, BUT HERE IS A QUOTE --
>>THAT'S THE SKILL THAT PEOPLE
LIKE TILLERSON, WHO IS A
BUSINESSMAN, WHO IS LIKE --
THINGS TILLERSON DID WHEN HE
FIRST BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE
WAS, ESSENTIALLY, DON'T MAKE ME
REPORT BRIBES.
BECAUSE HE'S LIKE
I'M AN EXXON MOBIL GUY AND I
KNOW THAT SOMETIMES I HAVE TO
TALK TO HEADS OF STATE OR LOCAL
OLIGARCHS, SOMETIMES THEY'RE THE
SAME PERSON, AND IN ORDER TO GET
MY WELLS DRILLED THAT'S WHAT I
HAVE TO DO.
THEN HE LOOKS AT
DONALD TRUMP, HE MAKES BUILDINGS
THAT ARE GOLD AND THAT'S IT.
THAT'S HIS BUSINESS.
AND FOR
TRUMP, HE ONLY EVER NEEDS TO
TALK TO OLIGARCHS.
SO TRUMP IS
WORKING ON THIS LEVEL BUT
TILLERSON SEES HIMSELF AS BEING
ABOVE, AND THAT LEVEL IS BELOW
THAT, OSTENSIBLY,, OF PEOPLE WHO
HAVE WORKED AT THE STATE
DEPARTMENT BEFORE, WHO HAVE
EXPERIENCED THAT, BUT THAT COMES
WITH ITS OWN DRAWBACKS BECAUSE
YOU ARE INSIDE THE SYSTEM AND
YOU HAVE TO SAY YES TO THE RIGHT
PEOPLE TO BUBBLE UP THERE, BUT
JUST TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THESE TWO, AND HAVE IT
POTENTIALLY BE HANDED OVER TO
POMPEO, WHO WAS THE HEAD OF THE
CIA, BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW TO SAY
NICE THINGS -- OR BAD THINGS TO
THE PRESIDENT NICELY?
IT'S SO
FRUSTRATING.
>>LET'S FLASH BACK AND REMEMBER
WHO POMPEO IS, HE WAS A
CONGRESSMAN IN THE TEA PARTY
WAVE, HE WAS A KOCH BROTHERS
CONGRESSMAN.
YOU HAVE THE EXXON
MOBIL GUY, NOW THE KOCH BROTHERS
CONGRESSMAN, HE CLEARLY KNOWS
HOW TO KISS ASS.
THE KOCH
BROTHERS GAVE HIM $375,000, 14%
OF HIS FUNDING FOR CONGRESS CAME
FROM OIL AND GAS INTERESTS.
IF
YOU WERE GOING TO GET RID OF
TILLERSON, THEY ARE JUST
REPLACING FOSSIL FUEL GUY WITH
ANOTHER FOSSIL FUEL GUY AND WHEN
I LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE OF
WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN WITH
TRUMP, I KNOW REAL ESTATE
DEVELOPERS WOULD HAVE A GOOD
TIME, AND RICH PEOPLE, I NEVER
THOUGHT FOSSIL FUELS WOULD BE
THIS CENTRAL TO THIS PARTICULAR
ADMINISTRATION.
THERE WAS NO
INDICATION OF THIS BEFOREHAND.
THAT'S WHY I'M UPSET ABOUT THE
POMPEO PICK, FOSSIL FUELS,
THEY'VE GOT A STRANGLEHOLD ON
THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION.
>>I THINK THEY'VE HAD A
STRANGLEHOLD ON OUR GOVERNMENT.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER,
BUT BEFORE HE LEFT OFFICE BARACK
OBAMA WAS WHEN TO LET THAT
SITUATION IN NORTH DAKOTA PLAY
OUT. AND THE REASON WE HAVE ALL
THESE FRACKING PIPES IS BECAUSE
BARACK OBAMA LIFTED THE
RESTRICTION OF EXPORTING FOSSIL
FUELS FROM OUR COUNTRY, WHICH IS
WHY IT IS NOW CRISSCROSSED WITH
FRACKING PIPES.
TRUMP JUST TAKES
THE PRETTY FACE OF THE HORRIBLE
SHIT THAT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS
BEEN DOING SINCE BILL CLINTON.
>>IT PUTS YOU IN A WEIRD
POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE TO
EITHER JUDGE THE BEHAVIOR OF
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT
THEY ARE DOING, OR HAVE TO MAKE
A DECISION AS TO WHETHER THIS
PERSON KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THEY
ARE DOING.
OR ANYTHING ABOUT
WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
WITH OBAMA
-- I GET WHAT YOU ARE SAYING --
>>OBAMA OPEN TO THE ARCTIC TO
DRILLING.
>>AS PART OF A STRATEGY, IT
COULD BE CLAIMED, TO LOWER THE
PRICE OF GAS AND DESTABILIZE THE
PEOPLE IN OTHER REGIONS OF THE
WORLD.
IT'S TOTALLY BUSINESS AND
COMMERCE BASED, DESTABILIZE
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT RELY ON
FOSSIL FUEL EXPORTS, AND YOU'VE
SEEN THAT BEAR OUT.
WE MAKE THE
OIL NOW, AND MORE ENERGY, AND SO
NOW THE MIDDLE EAST IS FURTHER
DESTABILIZED, AS RUSSIA IS AS
WELL, AND THAT'S WHY PUTIN HATES
OBAMA AND HILLARY, BECAUSE THEY
COST HIM JILLIANS OF DOLLARS.
AT
LEAST I CAN WRAP MY MIND AROUND
IT, I'M NOT SAYING WHAT OBAMA
DID WAS GOOD, BUT I CAN WRAP MY
MIND AROUND THAT IT MAKES SENSE
AS AN APPROACH.
THIS ONE,
THERE'S A GOOD COP/BAD COP THING
TRUMP IS TRYING TO DO, BUT
THERE'S NO ABILITY TO BELIEVE
THAT THE GOOD COP CAN DO
ANYTHING.
NOW YOU'VE GOT
TILLERSON WHO GOES UP AND SAYS
THINGS LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO
TALK, WE CAN TALK TO THE NORTH
KOREANS AND HAVE A DISCUSSION,
THEN YOU HAVE TRUMP SAYING NAH,
DON'T TALK TO ROCKET MAN WITH
THE CHINA THING.
SO TILLERSON
GOES AND TALKS TO CHINA AND
CHINA SAYS WE WILL EXERT MORE
PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA IF WE
CAN REASONABLY BELIEVE THAT
AMERICA WON'T START A WAR. AND
TRUMP JUST COMPLETELY UNDERMINED
THE REASONABLY BELIEVE PART.
THAT'S WHAT'S SO FRUSTRATING,
MAYBE YOU REPLACE TILLERSON WITH
POMPEO, BUT WHAT IS TO SAY THAT
TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO KEEP BEING
THIS CRAZY BAD COP?
THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS TO BE,
IT'S HIS FANTASY, LIKE HE'S
JIZZING ALL OVER THE WORLD, I
GET TO BE THE BAD COP, I'M
FROM NEW YORK.
>>THE ONE THING TRUMP IS GOOD AT
IS MANIPULATING THE PRESS.
HE
LEARNED EARLY IN HIS CAREER IN
THE 80S, HOW TO STEAL A NEWS
CYCLE, IF YOU GET HEAT ABOUT ONE
THING, YOU SAY SOMETHING MORE
OUTRAGEOUS AND THEY WILL FOLLOW
THAT, THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN
DOING OVER AND OVER, AND I
WOULDN'T DOUBT, I THINK ACTUALLY
THE CHANCES ARE, THAT HIM SAYING
THAT STUFF ABOUT THE CALM BEFORE
THE STORM, THAT'S JUST HIM
TRYING TO GRAB THE HEADLINES
BACK.
NOW EVERYONE IS GOING
NUTS, WHAT DID HE MEAN?
EVERYONE
IS BACK TALKING ABOUT TRUMP, IT
IS OFF TILLERSON AND THE
MORON COMMENT, HE JUST STOLE
THE NEWS CYCLE AGAIN.
IT'S PROBABLY AS SHALLOW AS
THAT.
>>AND WE HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM
THE GUN DISCUSSION ALREADY.
