4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,590
still feel like I need to lend my voice

5
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,920
to the debate and recently some

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,210
allegations have come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> light that</font>

00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,299

nature of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessity of sexual consent</font>

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,390
and I suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and watch them</font>

18
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,680
both of their links are down in the

00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,180
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting video about fans</font>

coming blindly to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense of some of</font>

those who have been accused<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

23
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,540
acts and how it's very possible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

things when they turn off the camera

26
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,970
because the price<font color="#CCCCCC"> surprised we all have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a movie and get to choose exactly what</font>

28
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,220
you see just because you are subscribed

and you bought the christmas single does

30
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,420
not mean that you know this content

31
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,910
creator intimately a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people</font>

32
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,380
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been tied up in this I have</font>

33
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,440
known personally and although it is

34
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,350
shocking for me for these sexual abuse

35
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,810
cases to come to light it sadly doesn't

36
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,430
surprise me because I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

37
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,590
kind of culture has been growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font>

38
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,750
community as we have seen the gap

39
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,050
between creator and fan become a chasm

40
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,920
and it makes me wonder whether our

41
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,100
community is now sick the further away

42
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,290
the fans have gotten from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> creators</font>

43
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the easier has been for sex with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a young</font>

45
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,190
like a conquest and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> ward for all</font>

46
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,750
of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard work that you put into</font>

47
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,370
making that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cinnamon challenge video</font>

48
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,200
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no doubt that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

49
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,000
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hank has already said that</font>

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,070
he's going to team up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with existing</font>

51
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,790
sexual assault charities and we've seen

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UK the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big superstars Charlie so</font>

53
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,200
cool like on Jamal Edwards from<font color="#CCCCCC"> sbtv</font>

54
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,390
team up with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Home Office in there</font>

55
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,580
this is abuse campaign which is about

56
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,769
sexual assault<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sexual awareness</font>

57
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:11,080
these positive things are already

58
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,880
happening this conversation that we're

59
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,020
having about abuse and consent is

60
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,520
really happening the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

61
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,660
thing for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stomach is the fact that</font>

62
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,270
we know these people we know these girls

63
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,740
who are standing up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now talking</font>

64
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">about their experiences</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the guys who</font>

65
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,790
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> now posting apologies on tumblr</font>

66
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,070
whether you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just watch their videos or</font>

67
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,390
whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to go to the pub with</font>

70
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,720
held accountable<font color="#CCCCCC"> for their actions and</font>

71
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,270
can't get away<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this behavior like</font>

72
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,250
we have seen in so many other creative

73
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,010
industries in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past part of the blame</font>

74
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,470
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on us for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> letting it go under the</font>

75
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,040
radar<font color="#E5E5E5"> for such a long time and I need to</font>

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,020
call people out on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this behavior and you</font>

77
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,970
need to call people out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this behavior</font>

78
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,590
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day we are still a</font>

79
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,390
community and God knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtubers are</font>

80
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,950
really good at talking about themselves

81
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,680
so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what you guys think we</font>

82
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,540
can do to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that this culture</font>

83
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,580
doesn't take hold can we be doing

84
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,860
anything more than just awareness

85
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,620
campaigns and how much is the onus on us

86
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,170
if any there's a comment section below

87
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,750
use it we are still a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font>

88
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,700
that is capable of tackling the problems

89
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,980
that we come<font color="#CCCCCC"> across as we grow and as we</font>

90
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,690
develop and that's why I'm still here

91
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,540
after seven years of<font color="#E5E5E5"> making videos this</font>

92
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,190
isn't the first time that we've come

93
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,540
across these kinds of issues in the

94
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,790
history of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the human race but maybe this</font>

95
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,430
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are in a position to make a</font>

96
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,570
change maybe I've been roaming with

97
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,340
oranges thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for watching</font>
