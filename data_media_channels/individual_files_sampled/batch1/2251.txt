we have a lot of successful presidents where we didn't see their promise in their potential early on in that first hundred days so it turns out not to be a very good predictor it's not fair to judge presidents by the first hundred days it's both been a media narrative and candidates themselves have fed into that talking about what they're going to do during that first hundred days only two presidents had produced legislation that we would consider historic or landmark acts and those were Lyndon Johnson in 1965 with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and then Barack Obama and his economic stimulus package passed early on in his term in 2009 most of the other important legislation that we look back and think of say the 1965 Voting Rights Act or President Reagan's first budget none of those were with it within the hundred days it is true that presidents do tend to be more productive earlier in their terms than later in their terms in general when president's approval ratings are higher which usually happens at the beginning of their terms members of Congress seeing that they're popular back in the district are a little more amenable to being receptive to presidential requests as the term goes on the president makes more enemies and Congress becomes less receptive is fair to judge a president based on their legislative record after about a year the data that I looked at showed that maybe about a third of all the things that a president is going to do during his term might get accomplished in that very first year after about a year already Bill Clinton George Bush some of these presidents who had nothing to show during the first hundred days we're quite productive and that ended up being a good predictor of all the things they accomplished by the end of the first four years we have other presidents Jimmy Carter is a famous example who was not as legislatively successful after the first year he had no major landmark enactments and that turned out to be quite predictive of the rest of his first term
