you can have a lot of happy people faced with growing outrage a real retreat from President Donald Trump on his controversial policy of separating families who enter the US illegally we're gonna have strong very strong borders but we're going to keep the families together I didn't like the sight or the feeling of families being separated those who enter the US illegally will still be prosecuted a continuation of trumps to zero tolerance border policy but families will be kept together while they wait for a hearing before an immigration judge but the Trump administration can't keep children in detention indefinitely under US law in what is known as the Florida settlement you have to be placed with a close relative or friend normally within 20 days and those who are in custody have to be kept in the least restrictive conditions possible the executive order that the administration announced today is going to set up family incarceration camps on Department of Defense facilities around the country but the executive order itself acknowledges that that is not a long-term solution and kids will not be allowed to remain in those facilities for the duration of their proceedings the Trump administration will now seek an urgent court hearing to modify that agreement to allow them to detain families for longer if you're really really pathetically weak the country is going to be overrun with millions of people Trump's executive order is only a temporary solution to the broader problem of immigration reform meeting at the White House Republicans argued for measures to stop migrants entering the US and then disappearing without appearing before an immigration judge as president you know you're a real bi if you detained the adults though the law requires the children to be separated if you let the adults into the country they never show up seems to me that we want to keep the family together the parents show up for their day in court Democrats dispute Trump's claim he was simply enforcing the law when it comes to separating children from their pimps Democrats argue it was a choice he uses what amounts to government sponsored child abuse as political leverage a bargaining chip in his effort to force through an extremist immigration agenda the House of Representatives will force an immigration legislation on Thursday but with competing ideas on the best way forward there's no clear idea of what might get enough votes to succeed and this issue isn't about to go away Allen Fisher al Jazeera Washington
