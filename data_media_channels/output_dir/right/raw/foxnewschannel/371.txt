1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,737
>> Sandra: THE SENATE IS BACK

2
00:00:05,738 --> 00:00:07,639
IN SESSION AND WE'RE LESS THAN

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,741
AN HOUR AWAY FROM A KEY VOTE ON

4
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:10,675
BRETT KAVANAUGH.

5
00:00:10,676 --> 00:00:14,279
JOINING US LIVE IN CALIFORNIA

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,480
CONGRESSMAN DARYL ISSA, THIS IS

7
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:16,181
A BIG MOMENT.

8
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:18,049
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,419
WITH SOME OF THOSE UNDECIDED

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,921
REPUBLICAN SENATORS MAINLY

11
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,455
FLAKE, MURCOWSKI AND COLLINS

12
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:26,658
WITH THIS ONE-WEEK DELAY IN THE

13
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:27,659
F.B.I. INVESTIGATION?

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,960
>> I SERVED WITH BOTH JEFF

15
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:30,595
FLAKE AS A HOUSE MEMBER AND

16
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:32,564
WITH SUSAN COLLINS WHEN SHE WAS

17
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:36,367
MY COUNTERPART ON OVERSIGHT.

18
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:37,502
SHE VALUES AND JEFF ALSO SERVED

19
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:39,404
ON OVERSIGHT IN THE HOUSE.

20
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:42,006
THEY VALUE A GOOD INVESTIGATION.

21
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:44,275
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS HAD

22
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:45,677
SEVEN GOOD INVESTIGATIONS AND

23
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,312
THIS LAST ONE WAS EVERYTHING

24
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:50,181
THAT COULD BE ADDED TO WHAT HAD

25
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:52,217
ALREADY BEEN AN INCREDIBLY

26
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,319
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF HEARINGS

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,852
AND INVESTIGATIONS.

28
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:57,155
SO I THINK THEY ARE CONVINCED.

29
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:58,523
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE

30
00:00:58,524 --> 00:00:59,691
CONVINCED WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE

31
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,559
OF KNOWING THAT THE DEMOCRATS

32
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,961
ARE ASKING FOR AN INVESTIGATION

33
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,362
TO GO ON.

34
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:05,630
NOT AN INVESTIGATION THAT

35
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:07,765
YIELDS ANY NEW INFORMATION.

36
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:09,367
>> Sandra: JOE MANCHIN IS STILL

37
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:11,469
AN UNDECIDED VOTE AS WELL.

38
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,873
AS HE WAS WALKING INTO THE SCIF

39
00:01:15,874 --> 00:01:17,542
TO READ THE REPORT AGAIN THIS

40
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:18,476
MORNING HE CHATTED WITH

41
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:22,213
REPORTERS FOR A FEW SECONDS AND

42
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:23,381
SAID UNDECIDED.

43
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:24,315
I WILL PROBABLY BE UNDECIDED

44
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:25,683
UNTIL I WALK IN THE DOOR.

45
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:27,785
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM HIM?

46
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,420
>> HE IS A THOUGHTFUL MEMBER.

47
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:31,489
I KNEW HIM WHEN HE FIRST CAME

48
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,292
TO THE SENATE AND HE CAME UP

49
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:35,460
AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF.

50
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:35,927
WE CHATTED.

51
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:38,463
AND WE GOT TO BE WHAT I WOULD

52
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:38,896
CALL FRIENDS.

53
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:41,032
HE IS THE KIND OF PERSON WHO

54
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:43,134
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A PARTY

55
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:44,569
THAT HE WILL ALIGN WITH.

56
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,737
HE WILL ALIGN WITH THE TRUTH.

57
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:49,040
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIS

58
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:49,807
HISTORY ON OTHER CONFIRMATIONS,

59
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:51,142
HE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE

60
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:53,011
DEMOCRATS WHO, WHEN HE THOUGHT

61
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,178
SOMEBODY WAS QUALIFIED, VOTED

62
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:56,514
FOR THEM AND PERHAPS IS ONE OF

63
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:57,215
THE FIRST CROSSOVERS.

64
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:59,851
SO I'M NOT GOING TO PREDICT HIS

65
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:00,151
VOTE.

66
00:02:00,152 --> 00:02:02,854
WHAT I'LL SAY IS HE IS A

67
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:04,022
THOUGHTFUL MEMBER WHO WILL VOTE

68
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:04,922
HIS CONSCIENCE.

69
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:06,591
>> Sandra: HE WAS ASKED WHAT

70
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:08,626
ARE YOU WEIGHING THE MOST?

71
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,828
HIS RESPONSE WAS EVERYTHING.

72
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:11,529
CONGRESSMAN FOR THOSE STILL

73
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,164
UNDECIDED AS THEY WALK IN TO

74
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:14,565
PLACE THEIR VOTES THIS MORNING,

75
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:17,101
THIS FIRST VOTE ON THE

76
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:18,503
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION, TO BE

77
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:19,671
CLEAR, MINDS CAN CHANGE AND CAN

78
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,272
CHANGE THE VOTE IN THE VOTE

79
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:22,607
THAT WOULD HAPPEN TOMORROW

80
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:24,876
AFTER THE 30 HOURS.

81
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:30,248
WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE

82
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:31,349
UNDECIDED SENATORS ARE WEIGHING

83
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,550
THE MOST RIGHT NOW?

84
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:34,152
>> I THINK IF THEY'RE DOING

85
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,787
WHAT I HOPE THEY WOULD DO IS

86
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,356
THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE LAST 25

87
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:42,260
YEARS OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND

88
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:43,428
THEY'RE ASKING I'M A SENATOR,

89
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,963
HOW WOULD I BE IF YOU HAD TO GO

90
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:47,332
BACK FURTHER THAN 25 YEARS?

91
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,700
IF YOU HAD TO GO BACK TO JUNIOR

92
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,868
HIGH OR HIGH SCHOOL?

93
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:52,837
AM I A GOOD SENATOR?

94
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:55,840
BECAUSE TODAY I DO MY JOB OR AM

95
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:57,975
I A GOOD SENATOR BECAUSE I'VE

96
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:59,811
NEVER DONE ANY WRONG AND NEVER

97
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,978
ANY MISTAKES INCLUDING AN EXTRA

98
00:03:00,979 --> 00:00:00,000
BEER.
