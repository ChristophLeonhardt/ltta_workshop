honestly the bad press and criticism were expected a given but surprisingly enough it was what Putin said that really irked them President Putin did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that yes I wanted him to win because he talked about bringing us Russia relations back to normal you'd think it's a no-brainer one candidate Hillary says she wants to rule but crush Russia the other candidate Trump says he wants to be friends why is this scandalous who on earth would back the person that hates them why are they acting surprised that might have been the only honest moment of this news conference when Vladimir Putin said yes he didn't want President Trump to win yeah it's still not a secret it was never a secret Putin just like any other world leader preferred a certain candidate that's best for his country and no it isn't shocking because it's happened before here's what Putin told us RT in 2012 about candidate Barack Obama interested in the stories you know so I can feel what my partner feels I think he's an honest man who really wants to change much for the better but can he really achieve that will they let him you go by today's logic Obama must have been a Russian porn why else would Putin support him there's no other explanation but seriously we wanted to see what people think about this my colleague Khaled mopin went out and asked New Yorkers he's an honest man who really wants to change much for the better well that's that's what Putin said about a US presidential candidate what do you make of that yeah actually what Putin said about Obama well I know Obama is very honest actually what Putin said about Obama I think Obama is an honest man an honest man who really wants to change much for the better that's what Putin said about Obama well I mean I think anything said about Obama is not gonna be as you know taught in the media you know Trump's way more talk about Trump it's way more sexy and you know intriguing to the general public so I think that's probably why you know the media doesn't make a big deal about that I found the media has gotten much more fractured and much more opinionated over my lifetime it's it's much more of a of a left and right kind of mouthpiece that it it used to be I think so what you might say back in 2012 Russia wasn't the boogeyman there was no alleged hacking no reported meddling no collusion conspiracies yeah there were it was just Fringe President Obama appears determined to ingratiate himself with the Kremlin this unfortunately seems to be the real meaning of his reset policy now staning example is the personal phone call that Barack Obama made to Vladimir Putin from Air Force One congratulating the Russian leader on his election as Russia's next president and yet when it was Trump that congratulated Putin which is completely ordinary and formal thing to do in politics they chewed him out for it for weeks president Trump's national security team warned him not to congratulate radomir putin's explicitly writing in capital letters on his briefing papers do not congratulate talking to Putin right now would be like cheating on your wife and then posing for a picture with the woman you cheated with and oh right he did that to Vladimir Putin won an election rigged to prop up a dangerous strong man who was threatening Western democracy that requires a strong response so Donald Trump called him up to say attaboy Russia's made no secret of it it wants to be friends of course it does sanctions conflicts all of that and in the Obama era on the whole that was seen as acceptable but times are different now you get the impression that the only thing the establishment would have been satisfied with is a brutal bloody bare-knuckle brawl between the two presidents you
