as the World Cup is just around the corner it seems to be scaremongering galore from some of the tabloid newspapers here in the UK essentially spreading the message of don't go or else and discussing all sorts of possible horrific scenarios that could take place and among the one of just many of the latest stories being discussed are alleged death threats being made against the LGBT community and this is by far not the first time that something like this is being discussed we've seen headlines talk about things such as Russia about to unleash its hooligans how the police are quote thuggish in Russia how there is a threat of being whipped by Cossack horsemen during the World Cup this summer as well as talk of racism and hackers potentially breaking into your phones through Wi-Fi when you're there as a fan and while all of this whipping up a frenzy is unraveling we've been hearing officials from both sides really in Russia as well as here in the UK say that everything is going to be okay among those people was Britain's top football police chief who was speaking at Foreign Affairs Select Committee hearing who said basically Russia's on top of it and the same message came from the England Football Association what we've been engaging over the past two years in conjunction with the Foreign Office but also the FA and FSF to try and seek those reassurances from the Russian authorities and we've had a great number of meetings with them and every time we've met them there is a consistent reassurance that their aspiration is to put on a safe event that shows Russia to the best of its abilities our security team have been impressed with what they've seen on the ground and Russia has really practically all the organization's went to the Confederations Cup last year and actually I think you know encouraged by what they saw do we feel prepared do we feel we've had the right support that we've needed from from the official channels on I think that sent from the phase perspective we would say yes we do think well the Foreign Office has also been releasing certain instructions that have been playing down and he worried about what could happen during the World Cup they have said that among other things since 2016 five matches involving British teams have taken place in Russia and those without any trouble and of course the fact that British police and Russian police have been cooperating ahead of the World Cup and British police will in fact also be present on the ground as the World Cup unravels and of course this is far from the first time that a big major sporting events take place in Russia and this sort of scare mongering as attempted however we've seen in the past that things have gone well and certainly that will be the case this time around as well hopefully
