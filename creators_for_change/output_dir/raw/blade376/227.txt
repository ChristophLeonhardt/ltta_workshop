33
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:36,970
you feel great about achieving and then

34
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,409
you step back out into the real world

35
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:43,060
and think what a waste of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:50,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight for me was TV series if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,860
particular TV series but I realized this

00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,119
year there's been quite a few of watch

41
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,409
prison break Dexter and lost my favorite

42
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,149
programs all tend to be ones with moral

43
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:06,670
dilemmas prison break probably has the

44
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,959
least association with that theme but

45
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,480
Dexter is a great controversial thriller

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,630
drama series which is about a forensic

47
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,600
blood spatter analysis who actually goes

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,700
out and them is a serial killer himself

49
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,069
but he hunts down the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

in life don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough patience and</font>

54
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,060
if you actually do look into the

55
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,590
background of the stories if you look

56
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,500
online like<font color="#E5E5E5"> lostpedia call me a geek if</font>

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,920
interesting and there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,100

four is now for those you that don't

125
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,950
know the BBC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Endemol you</font>

126
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,660
normally do big brother got in contact

127
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,970
they wanted to do a show spend six hours

128
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,550
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a box entertain the nation but then I</font>

129
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,800
realized they were asking other members

130
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,900
of the UK YouTube community to take part

131
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they wanted to sort of sponge off</font>

132
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,640
all our fan base and use it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the show</font>

133
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,920
so I thought why compete when we could

134
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,320
work together and put something on for

135
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,870
the community a<font color="#E5E5E5"> gathering so we all</font>

136
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,030
teamed up we took part in this TV show

137
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,080
and we did about 48 hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we won the</font>

138
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,020
final<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 grand whoo youtube community</font>

139
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,240
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an incredible experience</font>

140
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,010
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was one those moments in</font>

141
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,870
life where it really affirms to you that

142
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,550
you know if you put your mind something

143
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,530
you can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get what you want to say</font>

144
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,600
because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't the favorites in that</font>

145
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,460
competition a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people hated us</font>

146
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,410
thought we were making a mockery of the

147
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,530
place you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were but it is because</font>

148
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">we knew more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

149
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,080
internet and online community then

150
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Endemol did and they didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

151
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,220

156
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,770

171
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,030

172
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,260
family have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> incredibly supportive</font>

173
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,820
whether it was about me going to America

174
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,130
or whether it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> me just going through</font>

175
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,770
tough times and me<font color="#E5E5E5"> really needing</font>

176
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,490
support because um it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tough end</font>

177
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,010
of the year for me and even when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

178
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,630
on the verge of self-destruction they

179
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,220
stuck by me and it's times like that

180
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,780
that make me realize how lucky and

181
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,700
fortunate I am to have very close family

182
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,790
so I was gonna maybe put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit lower</font>

183
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,920
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list but his family and I know</font>

184
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,240
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be watching the videos so</font>

185
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,300
I didn't know number three we're almost

186
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,540
there so my second<font color="#E5E5E5"> best thing of 2008</font>

187
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,550
had to be my album<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the year which is</font>

188
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,070
misery signals with controller and this

189
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,620
album<font color="#E5E5E5"> saved my life and I think people</font>

190
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">tend to underestimate music and this</font>

191
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,779
album is just incredible now it's very

192
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,730
very heavy so a lot of you may not like

193
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,520
it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but the technicality of it</font>

194
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,330
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the melodic verse heavy parts of</font>

195
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,380
the songs and especially especially the

196
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,080
lyrics are just mind-blowing and I find

197
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even when you're going</font>

198
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,690
through tough times needed to tell on a

199
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,300
CD that<font color="#E5E5E5"> relates to your situation it</font>

200
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,370
gives you that sense of identity so if

201
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,440
any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are in heavy music or any of</font>

202
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,810
you would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try some heavy music</font>

203
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,029
misery signals controller it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

204
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:45,790
album and is therefore my album<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

205
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,440
year so left with one more thing what

206
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,899
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best thing of 2008 for me</font>

207
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,850
I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna cut to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the chase my</font>

208
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,899
number one thing of 2008 was my true

209
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,010
friends why hello chaps and mistresses

210
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,000
unfortunately due to copyright reasons

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,250
we could not<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the music that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> miles</font>

212
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,620
wanted to use for friends however for

213
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">this contribution I will be having to</font>

214
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,000
use both<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my hands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and therefore my</font>

215
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">moustache must depart for a short period</font>

216
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,700
of time so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go my rendition of</font>

217
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:25,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the theme tune of friends that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is all</font>

218
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,709
tell me her and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I put that as</font>

219
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:32,170
number one is and when you go through

220
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,779
tough situations in life you get a real

221
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,940
clarity of who your true friends are now

222
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,160
for me friends don't necessarily mean

223
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,990
people that you hang out with every day

224
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,570
and but it's just people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

225
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,730
respect people that respect you for who

226
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,860
you are people who can lend their time

227
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,440
and people you can communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> openly</font>

228
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,160
with and whether it's people i know

229
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,520
online or in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> street and it's just</font>

230
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,240
the most heartwarming thing when you're

231
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,180
in need of someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're there</font>

232
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,140
with open arms sometimes literally and

233
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,040
they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to help you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

234
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,410
things because I'm

235
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,839
lately my life has been the toughest

236
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,819
it's ever been and for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

237
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:18,879
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannot thank</font>

238
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,810
you enough because well<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's just say I</font>

239
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,930
needed it n I owe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so thank you</font>

240
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,910
thank you thank you and I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> a best</font>

241
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,189
example was I went to a nightclub in

242
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:34,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">Reading last couple of weeks called</font>

243
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:37,269
secure and when I was in there um I

244
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> normally stay till it closes I</font>

245
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,050
normally get bored of nightclubs but I'm

246
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,139
literally are about 100 people were

247
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,639
there that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all walks of life</font>

248
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,680
literally all walks of life people had

249
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,379
seen from four years ago people that I

250
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:51,910
may have seen earlier in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year or</font>

251
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,930
people have been hanging out with lately

252
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,019
they were all there o our miles miles

253
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,750
and considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've taken a lot of time</font>

254
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,910
out and I was feeling very vulnerable

255
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,889
and very insignificant to have that and

256
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:09,040
to know your true friends and to fill

257
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">respects and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to reflect that and</font>

258
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,019
respect them in return<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just think is</font>

259
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:16,870
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most special things in life</font>

260
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,480
and on that night that is my top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

261
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,079
things of 2008 and therefore I put the

262
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,389
question to you what are your top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

263
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:28,060
things and maybe they might be more

264
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,430
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> than mine so I guess that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

265
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">it here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 2009</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cheers I'm not</font>

266
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,370
drinking this this has been on my

267
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,860
bedside table for a few days actually

268
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,269
it's probably matured a lot and<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

269
00:12:40,269 --> 00:00:00,000
worth more in value than it was no
