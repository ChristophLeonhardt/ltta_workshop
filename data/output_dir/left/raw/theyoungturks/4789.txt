1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,400
EARLY THIS MORNING A MASSIVE

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:07,919
FIRE TORE THROUGH THE GRAND FELT
BUILDING IN WEST LONDON.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,919
UP TO

4
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:12,480
POSSIBLY 600 PEOPLE WERE
BELIEVED TO BE IN THE APARTMENT

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,650
BUILDING, MANY OF THEM TRAPPED
AS THE FIRE CONTINUED.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,810
IT IS

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,900
BELIEVED TO HAVE BROKEN OUT ON
ONE OF THE BOTTOM FLOORS.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,910
IT IS HORRIFYING.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:34,950
YES, LONDON Ã± THIS HAS BEEN
THERE DAY DEALING WITH THIS

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,950
FIRE.

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,450
TRAGICALLY MANY DID DIE

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:01:09,650
ALREADY.

13
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:18,740
AS THIS HAS BEEN GOING
ON, PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHAT

14
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,740
CAUSED THIS?

15
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:35,140
HOW DID 

16
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:49,530
IT 
SPREAD

17
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,520
SO QUICKLY?

18
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,670
THERE'S BEEN A LOT

19
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,970
OF TALK ABOUT THE REPLACEMENT OF

20
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,600
THE CLOUDING ON THE OUTSIDE OF
THE BUILDING.

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
SOME PEOPLE SAY IT

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,040
WAS MAINLY REPLACED TO MAKE THE
BUILDING LOOK COSMETICALLY MORE

23
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,008
ATTRACTIVE BUT THEORETICALLY IT
COULD'VE MADE IT MORE VULNERABLE

24
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,660
TO FIRE.

25
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,510
WE DO NOT KNOW IF THAT
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH HOW THE

26
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,810
FIRE SPREAD.

27
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:23,350
IF IT IS FOUND THAT FAULTY
WIRING WAS THE CAUSE, I THINK

28
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,630
IT'S JUST ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES

29
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,550
THAT THERE ARE SOME REGULATIONS
THAT MATTER.

30
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,990
IF YOU PUT THIS IN

31
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,630
THE US CONTEXT, IF YOU EVER WANT
TO DO ANY TYPE OF REFURBISHMENT

32
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,510
OR REMODELING IN YOUR HOME YOU
HAVE TO GO GET PERMITS.

33
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,970
IT IS

34
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,970
SUPER ANNOYING.

35
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:53,410
WHY
WOULD THIS BE ON YOUR MIND NOW?

36
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,940
PERMITS ARE THERE FOR A
REASON, TO ENSURE THE WORK IS

37
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,030
DONE BY A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL.

38
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,030
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ELECTRICITY

39
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,930
AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A

40
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,040
DISASTROUS FIRE.

41
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:16,099
REGULATIONS
LIKE THAT 

42
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:20,680
MAKE SENSE.

43
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
IT BREAKS

44
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,020
MY HEART TO KNOW THAT IF THE
FAULTY WIRING IS WHAT CAUSED

45
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:31,470
THIS, IT BREAKS MY HEART THAT
THESE PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T CARE

46
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,930
ENOUGH ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF
INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE

47
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,110
BUILDING TO ACTUALLY DO THE
RIGHT THING.

48
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,989
IT SAYS THAT THERE WAS
COMPLAINTS FOR YEARS.

49
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:42,989
IT'S CRAZY

50
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,300
TO LOOK AT THE LAST CENTURY AND
SEE HOW MUCH HORRIFIC DEADLY

51
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,400
FIRES DEFINED THE CENTURY.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
WE
DON'T SEE THESE THINGS HAPPEN

53
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,580
ANYMORE.

54
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:01,270
IT'S DEVASTATING AND IT
WAS PREVENTABLE.

55
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,270
THESE PEOPLE

56
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,540
NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND
CRIMINALLY CHARGED SO WE CAN SET

57
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,610
AN EXAMPLE.

58
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:13,060
YOU CANNOT CUT COSTS
BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL DIE.

59
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,769
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU

60
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,108
DEREGULATE AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO
RUN THEIR BUSINESSES OR THEIR

61
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:26,900
COMPANIES TO SEE FIT.

62
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,349
ONE OF THE
WAYS OF CUTTING COSTS IS MAY BE

63
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:36,669
HIRING PEOPLE BUT DON'T DO THE

64
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:39,699
JOB PROPERLY.

65
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,639
HOPEFULLY THAT IS THE LESSON
THAT IS LEARNED FROM THE START

66
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:51,430
BUT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
CAUSED 

67
00:04:51,430 --> 00:00:00,000
THE FIRE.
