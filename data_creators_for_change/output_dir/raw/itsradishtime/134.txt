hi guys so part of being a good and

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,009
interesting human is trying new things

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,509
but I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's something</font>

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,039
really powerful about trying something

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,530
and being like nope it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not my thing</font>

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,540
and just not worrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it anymore</font>

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,280
it means you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know yourself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,630
respect yourself and you can be

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">comfortable not doing things just</font>

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,010
because other people do them or because

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,570
other people expect you to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

12
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,220
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool is when you can</font>

13
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,039
completely eliminate entire categories

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,260
from your life all together for example

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,060
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> wear nail polish I don't own it</font>

16
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,399
I don't buy it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's just</font>

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">not something I get pleasure out of the</font>

18
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,540
upkeep is a pain and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not how</font>

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,309
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be spending my money so I</font>

20
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,649
don't and if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes issue with my</font>

21
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,290
toenails being just the color that they

22
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,800
grow out of my feet and honestly I don't

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you another thing I</font>

24
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't bother with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is baking it requires</font>

25
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,010
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of ingredients a lot of time and</font>

26
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,750
often a lot of equipment or appliances

27
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,940
