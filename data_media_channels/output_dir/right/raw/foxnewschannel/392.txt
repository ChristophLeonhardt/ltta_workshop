CONSISTENT.

21
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:42,816
WE STAND 100% WITH BRETT

23
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:45,419
THE INFORMATION THAT WAS ASKED

24
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,087

00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,062
IT'S TIME FOR THE SENATE TO

>> THE PRESIDENT IS WELL AWARE.

37
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,073
AS I SAID HE IS VERY CONFIDENT

38
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:07,408
IN HIS DECISION TO NOMINATE

39
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:08,442

>> THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I WOULD

46
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:19,787
BE PRIVY TO.

CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN TALKED TO

00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:25,192

FEW MINUTES AGO, THERE IS

NOTHING NEW IN THIS REPORT THEY

53
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:31,532
DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW AND IT IS

54
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:33,167
TIME FOR THE SENATE TO VOTE.

55
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:34,568
EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN ASKED

56
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:36,904
BY THE DEMOCRATS IS OUT THERE.

57
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:39,606
>> Bill: WE'VE BEEN TOLD THE

58
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:41,008
F.B.I. FOUND DEBORAH RAMIREZ, A

59
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,545
CLASSMATE AT YALE WHO MADE THE

60
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:45,713
ALLEGATION DURING THEIR

61
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:46,413
FRESHMAN YEAR THERE.

00:01:46,414 --> 00:01:49,683
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THE F.B.I.

63
00:01:49,684 --> 00:01:51,085
CONCLUDED ABOUT ITS QUESTIONING

64
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:52,753
OF DEBORAH RAMIREZ ABOUT THAT

65
00:01:52,754 --> 00:01:53,120
INCIDENT?

66
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:55,322
>> I CAN'T GET INTO THE WHO WAS

67
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,256
INTERVIEWED OR WHO WASN'T

68
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:56,657
INTERVIEWED.

69
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,526
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THE

70
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:00,461
WHITE HOUSE ACCOMMODATED THE

71
00:02:00,462 --> 00:02:01,628
SENATE'S REQUEST IN WHAT THEY

72
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:04,665
WANTED TO SEE THE F.B.I. DO.

73
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,833
THE F.B.I. DID EXACTLY WHAT

74
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,936
THEY DO BEST AND THAT'S THEY

75
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:09,536
CONDUCTED A BACKGROUND

76
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:10,337
INVESTIGATION AND PROVIDED THAT

77
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,271
INFORMATION TO THE SENATE AND

78
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:13,006
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE SENATE TO

79
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,074
TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND MAKE

80
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:16,210
A DECISION WHETHER OR NOT THEY

81
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:16,810
SUPPORT JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

82
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:19,079
HE HAS GIVEN MORE THAN ANY

83
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,514
OTHER NOMINEE IN HISTORY IN

84
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,116
TERMS OF INTERVIEWS AND

85
00:02:22,117 --> 00:02:22,649
DOCUMENTS AND TIME.

86
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,485
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE THIS

87
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:25,586
ENTIRE PROCESS A TOTAL DISGRACE.

88
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:27,755
IT IS TIME FOR THEM TO QUIT

89
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:30,023
PLAYING POLITICS AND START

90
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,191
DOING THEIR JOB AND LET'S PUT

91
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,327
THIS TO A VOTE AND LET'S DO IT

92
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:34,027
QUICKLY.

93
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:34,795
>> Sandra: THE PRESIDENT

94
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:38,565
TWEETED THIS MORNING ON THE

95
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,434
INCREDIBLE UPWARD IMPACT ON

96
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:41,368
VOTERS FROM THE UNFAIR

97
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,638
TREATMENT, AS HE CALLED IT, OF

98
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,339
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH.

99
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,973
EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT THE

100
00:02:45,974 --> 00:02:47,441
PRESIDENT IS SAYING THERE.

101
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:49,109
>> WE'RE HEARING IT EVERY

102
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,744
SINGLE PLACE THE PRESIDENT HAS

103
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:51,044
GONE.

104
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,379
YOU CAN FEEL THE ENERGY BOTH

105
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,348
FOR THE PRESIDENT AND FOR HIS

106
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:56,850
NOMINEE IN BRETT KAVANAUGH.

107
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:59,720
PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED AT THE WAY

108
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,956
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TOTALLY MADE

109
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:05,292
THIS PROCESS INTO A PARTISAN

110
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:06,226
BATTLE AND THEY'VE CREATED

111
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,095
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NEVER

112
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:09,029
HAVE HAPPENED.

113
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,997
THEY'VE UPENDED OUR JUDICIAL

114
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:12,666
SYSTEM AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE

115
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:13,467
IS ENERGIZED REPUBLICANS AND

116
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:14,435
THE PRESIDENT IS FEELING THAT

117
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:16,303
ENERGY IN ALL OF THE LOCATIONS

118
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:16,870
HE HAS BEEN.

119
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,473
YOU'VE SEEN POLLING COME OUT IN

120
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:22,342
THE LAST DAY THAT HAS

121
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:24,445
REPUBLICANS UP IN MONTANA --

122
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:25,913
CLOSING THE GAP IN MONTANA, UP

123
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,247
IN NORTH DAKOTA, WEST VIRGINIA.

124
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,183
I THINK THE MESSAGE IS VERY

125
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:29,650
CLEAR.

126
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,418
DEMOCRATS, YOU MADE A MISTAKE

127
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,887
HERE AND IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP

128
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:34,621
IN NOVEMBER.

129
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:36,256
AND CERTAINLY WE HOPE THAT THEY

130
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,891
WILL COME OUT AND VOTE IN

131
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:38,826
SUPPORT OF BRETT KAVANAUGH OVER

132
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:39,760
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

133
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,161
>> Bill: HAS ANYONE IN THE

134
00:03:41,162 --> 00:03:43,997
WHITE HOUSE STAFF BEEN IN

135
00:03:43,998 --> 00:03:45,666
CONTACT WITH SENATORS FLAKE,

136
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:46,800
MURCOWSKI AND COLLINS.

137
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:48,469
>> WE'RE CONTINUING TO STAY IN

138
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,804
CLOSE CONTACT WITH A NUMBER OF

139
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:52,105
SENATORS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

140
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,373
WORKING WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE

141
00:03:53,374 --> 00:03:55,242
WE GET THIS VOTE THROUGH.

142
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:56,844
>> Bill: WOULD YOU NAME ANY ONE

143
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,345
OF THOSE THREE AS SOMEONE YOU

144
00:03:58,346 --> 00:03:59,279
ARE IN CONTACT WITH?

145
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,681
>> I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE

146
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:02,082
WHITE HOUSE IS CONTINUING TO

147
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,951
STAY IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE

148
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,885
SENATE.

149
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:07,254
>> Bill: WHAT ABOUT DEMOCRATIC

150
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:08,021
SENATORS HEITKAMP AND MANCHIN,

151
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:09,590
ARE THEY INCLUDED IN THAT?

152
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:10,624
>> WE'LL CONTINUE TALKING WITH

153
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,259
THOSE INDIVIDUALS AS WELL.

154
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,794
LOOK, I THINK ONE OF THE

155
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,995
BIGGEST AND MOST TELLING PARTS

156
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:16,864
OF THIS PROCESS IS ALL OF THE

157
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:17,798
DEMOCRATS THAT ARE COMING OUT

158
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,432
CLAIMING THAT THEY WANT TO SEE

159
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:20,834
MORE, THAT THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN

160
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,469
ENOUGH ARE DEMOCRATS THAT HAVE

161
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,104
ALREADY PLEDGED AND PROMISED TO

162
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:24,838
VOTE NO.

163
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,240
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY WANT MORE

164
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:26,640
INFORMATION.

165
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,608
IT'S A TOTAL SHAM AND THEY NEED

166
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:29,543
TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AND STOP

167
00:04:29,544 --> 00:04:30,210
PLAYING POLITICS.

168
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:31,411
>> Sandra: THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

169
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:32,312
DOING THIS MORNING.

170
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,047
CHRIS COONS WAS ON "FOX &

171
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:37,184
FRIENDS" THE LAST PART OF THE

172
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:39,052
8:00 HOUR MAKING THAT CASE THAT

173
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:41,388
NOT ENOUGH WERE INTERVIEWED IN

174
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:42,789
THIS PROCESS AND DR. FORD'S

175
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,191
ATTORNEY HAS ISSUED A STATEMENT

176
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:47,060
ON HER BEHALF SAYING THIS ISN'T

177
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:47,995
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION

178
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,663
BECAUSE DR. FORD HERSELF WAS

179
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,931
NOT INTERVIEWED BY THE F.B.I.

180
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:52,666
IN THE SEVENTH INVESTIGATION.

181
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,834
WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT AND

182
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,969
WHITE HOUSE SAY BACK TO THAT?

183
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,371
>> I THINK IT'S SIMPLE.

184
00:04:57,372 --> 00:04:59,473
I CAN'T GET INTO WHO WAS OR

185
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:00,874
WASN'T INTERVIEWED BUT I CAN

186
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,276
TELL YOU THE WHOLE WORLD

187
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:04,211
WATCHED AS DR. FORD WAS

188
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:05,145
INTERVIEWED FOR HOURS BY THE

189
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:06,547
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE TO MAKE

190
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:06,980
THE DECISION.

191
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:09,416
THAT'S THE SENATORS THEMSELVES.

192
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:10,784
THEY HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO

193
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:12,953
ASK ANY QUESTION THEY WANTED OF

194
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:13,320
DR. FORD.

195
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:14,821
IF THEY DIDN'T GET ENOUGH THAT

196
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:16,123
WAS THEIR OWN FAULT BECAUSE

197
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:18,125
THEY DIDN'T STEP UP TO THE

198
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:19,359
PLATE AND ASK THE QUESTIONS

199
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,764
THEY NEEDED ANSWER TO.

200
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:25,399
TO THINK THAT THE F.B.I. NEEDS

201
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,934
TO INTERVIEW HER AGAIN IS

202
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:27,301
LUDICROUS.

203
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:28,569
THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO

204
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:28,835
SO.

205
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:31,071
IF THEY DIDN'T GET TO ASK WHAT

206
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:33,140
THEY WANTED IT'S THEIR OWN

207
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:34,074
MISTAKE.

208
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:36,410
>> Bill: SANDRA WAS REFERENCING

209
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:38,078
THE COONS INTERVIEW EARLIER.

210
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,479
NUMBER THREE FROM EARLIER TODAY

211
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,881
WHERE HE PRETTY MUCH SUGGESTS

212
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,282
THAT KAVANAUGH WILL GO THROUGH.

213
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:43,216
HE SAID THIS.

214
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,085
>> I THINK THIS WILL BE A VERY

215
00:05:45,086 --> 00:05:45,652
CLOSE VOTE.

216
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:48,589
IT HANGS BY A FEW UNDECIDED

217
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,523
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.

218
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:51,391
I HAVEN'T READ THIS REPORT YET.

219
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,227
IF I WERE TO JUST GUESS TODAY,

220
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,530
HE WILL BE NARROWLY CONFIRMED.

221
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,398
>> Bill: THAT'S FROM SENATOR

222
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,100
COONS NOW SIX DAYS LATER.

223
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:01,268
NOW, LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS IN

224
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,569
WASHINGTON THIS WEEK AND THE

225
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,604
PRESIDENT TOOK SOME HEAT FROM A

226
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:06,440
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA

227
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:07,841
ABOUT TALKING ABOUT DR. FORD AT

228
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:09,910
THAT RALLY THE OTHER NIGHT IN

229
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,778
MISSISSIPPI AND HE GOES TO

230
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:12,479
MINNESOTA LATER TODAY.

231
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,349
LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS ASKED ABOUT

232
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,516
THAT SPECIFICALLY YESTERDAY AND

233
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,418
THIS WAS HIS REACTION ON THAT

234
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,020
>> I'M THE FIRST PERSON TO SAY

235
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:23,423
I WANT TO HEAR FROM DR. FORD.

236
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,726
I THOUGHT SHE WAS HANDLED

237
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:26,426
RESPECTFULLY.

238
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,028
I THOUGHT KAVANAUGH WAS TREATED

239
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,931
LIKE CRAP.

240
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,867
YEAH, WELL BOO YOURSELFS.

241
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:35,535
>> THERE ARE THE BOO BIRDS FROM

242
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:36,236
HIS COMMENT THERE.

243
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:38,171
YOU TALK ABOUT THE SURGE IN

244
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:39,973
REPUBLICAN AND CONSERVATIVE

245
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:41,575
INTERESTS IN THE KAVANAUGH

246
00:06:41,576 --> 00:06:42,809
NOMINATION AND YOU THINK ABOUT

247
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,112
THE CROWD'S REACTION THE OTHER

248
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:45,812
NIGHT IN MISSISSIPPI.

249
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:49,549
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING ON THE

250
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:49,883
INSIDE?

251
00:06:49,884 --> 00:06:50,951
WHAT DO YOUR NUMBERS TELL YOU

252
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,819
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE NOW

253
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,654
ENGAGED IN THIS HEARING

254
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:55,622
PROBABLY IN A WAY THEY WERE NOT

255
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,325
PRIOR TO THE PAUSE LAST FRIDAY

256
00:06:58,326 --> 00:06:59,026
AFTERNOON?

257
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:00,427
>> CERTAINLY I THINK YOU'VE

258
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:01,828
SEEN NUMBERS FROM ACROSS THE

259
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:02,929
COUNTRY AND ENERGY FROM

260
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,964
INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

261
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,801
I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST

262
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,370
REASONS IS THE FAIRNESS AND THE

263
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:12,906
PROCESS AND THE POLITICS THAT

264
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:14,074
DEMOCRATS HAVE INJECTED INTO

265
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:15,542
THIS THAT WOULD TYPICALLY NEVER

266
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:19,346
BE PART OF A SUPREME COURT

267
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:20,313
NOMINEE'S HEARING PROCESS IS

268
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,014
WHAT THEY'VE DONE.

269
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:22,649
I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE

270
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,051
MOST OF THE OUTRAGE COMING FROM.

271
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:28,955
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT AREN'T

272
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:30,190
TYPICAL SUPPORTERS OF THE

273
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:32,225
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OUTSPOENG.

274
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:36,396
>> Bill: WAS IT A STRATEGY TO

275
00:07:36,397 --> 00:07:37,030
CHARACTERIZE DR. FORD'S

276
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:41,368
TESTIMONY LIKE HE DID IN

277
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:42,536
MISSISSIPPI?

278
00:07:42,537 --> 00:07:48,375
>> OUR STRATEGY IS SIMPLE FROM

279
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:48,942
DAY ONE.

280
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:50,143
OUR STRATEGY HAS BEEN REAL

281
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:51,078
SIMPLE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

282
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,012
SEEING IT HAPPEN.

283
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,680
>> Bill: HE APPEARED TO BE

284
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,216
RESTRAINED UP TO THAT MOMENT.

285
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:57,617
WAS THERE A CONSCIOUS DECISION

286
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:59,486
MADE THAT YOU ARE CHARACTERIZE

287
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,654
DR. FORD'S TESTIMONY THE WAY HE

288
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:02,522
DID THE OTHER NIGHT BASED ON

289
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,725
THE NUMBERS YOU ARE SEEING AND

290
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:06,827
THE SUPPORT ACROSS THE COUNTRY?

291
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:09,196
>> LOOK, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO

292
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:09,896
WITH THE NUMBERS.

293
00:08:09,897 --> 00:08:12,666
IT HAS TO DO SIMPLY WITH THE

294
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,301
PRESIDENT BEING THE LEADER AND

295
00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:15,836
CERTAINLY WANTING TO SEE HIS

296
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:17,003
NOMINEE BE TREATED FAIRLY.

297
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:20,741
HE WANTS THIS PROCESS TO BE RUN

298
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:21,441
THE RIGHT WAY.

299
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,677
EVERY SINGLE WORD -- I SAID

300
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:24,945
THIS YESTERDAY, EVERY SINGLE

301
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:27,514
WORD THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS

302
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:30,350
SAID DURING HIS TESTIMONY WAS

303
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:32,919
PICKED APART RELENTLESSLY.

304
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,552
HE WAS BADGERED.

305
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,589
AS LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID HE WAS

306
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,624
NOT NECESSARILY TREATED FAIRLY.

307
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,059
HE THOUGHT HE WAS TREATED

308
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:39,759
HORRIBLY AND THE PRESIDENT

309
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,627
WANTED TO POINT OUT THE

310
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:43,029
HYPOCRISY OF THAT AND HE

311
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,931
POINTED TO THE FACTS WHAT TOOK

312
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:45,866
PLACE DURING THAT TESTIMONY AND

313
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:47,467
DURING THAT HEARING.

314
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:48,969
>> Sandra: SARAH, RIGHT NOW THE

315
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,305
EXPECTATION IS THAT THERE WOULD

316
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:53,940
BE A PROCEDURAL VOTE SOMETIME

317
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:56,343
TOMORROW WITH A CONFIRMATION

318
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:57,444
VOTE AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE

319
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:57,811
SATURDAY.

320
00:08:57,812 --> 00:08:58,912
WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE

321
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,248
PREPARING FOR AS FAR AS A

322
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:01,715
TIMELINE?

323
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:02,716
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE SENATE

324
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:03,617
PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE TOP OF

325
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,252
THE NEXT HOUR.

326
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,686
>> RIGHT NOW OUR FOCUS IS

327
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:09,089
MAKING SURE WE GET HIM

328
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,690
CONFIRMED AND FIGURE OUT THE

329
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:11,658
LOGISTICS OF THE DETAILS AFTER

330
00:09:11,659 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT TAKES PLACE.
