SUPREME COURT.
JOINING US NOW WITH PERSPECTIVE,
DANA PRIO, HOST OF THE DAILY
BRIEFING ON FOX NEWS.
SHE JOINS US FROM NEW YORK.
DANA, LISTEN, YOU HAVE MORE
PERSONAL CONNECTION AND
NETWORKING WITH THE KAVANAUGHS
THAN MOST OF US DO, HAVING
WORKED IN BUSH 43 WHITE HOUSE.
HOW DO YOU THINK THE FAMILY MUST
FEEL AFTER WHAT THEY'VE BEEN
THROUGH TO GET TO THIS DAY?
>> POSSIBLY COMPLETELY SHATTERED
IN TERMS OF EXHAUSTION.
RELIEVED, POSSIBLY A LITTLE
EUPHORIA AS WELL.
AND ALSO MAYBE QUITE REFLECTIVE.
I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS
YOU SAW FROM BRETT KAVANAUGH
WHEN HE TESTIFIED IS HE TALKED
ABOUT HIS FAITH.
HE HAS A STRONG NATE IN
HE HAS A STRONG FATE IN
HE HAS A STRONG FAIE IN
HE HAS A STRONG FAITHIN
HE HAS A STRONG FAITH IN THE
LORD AND HE WAS RELYING ON THE
FAITH TO GET HIM THROUGH.
HE ALSO REVERES THE
CONSTITUTION, LOVES THE
CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW.
AND MAYBE AFTER TONIGHT, I THINK
HE'S PROBABLY THINKING AHEAD TO
THE CASES THAT WILL COME BEFORE
THE SUPREME COURT, THE MAJOR
ISSUES THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS TO
GRAPPLE WITH WHEN IT COMES TO
LIBERTY, WHEN IT COMES TO
PRIVACY, ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT
THE COUNTRY IS FACING.
I HOPE THAT HE AND HIS WIFE AND
DAUGHTERS AND FAMILY CAN TAKE A
MOMENT TO CELEBRATE.
THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.
THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH A
LOT.
AND I THINK WHEN HE WROTE THE OP
ED IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
THAT SOME PEOPLE LOVED, SOME
PEOPLE CHRIS
PEOPLE CRIIS
PEOPLE CRITICIZED, I THINK HE
WAS TRYING TO SIGNAL THAT THE
JUDGE THAT HE WAS FOR 12 YEARS
WITH OVER 300 OPINIONS, THAT
THAT IS THE KIND OF JUDGE HE
WILL BE ON THE SUPREME COURT.
SO I THINK SHANNON, THAT'S
PROBABLY WHAT IS ON HIS MIND
RIGHT NOW, POSSIBLY ALSO A LOT
OF GRATITUDE FOR THE PRESIDENT
WHO FIRST HIRED HIM IN THE BUSH
43 WHITE HOUSE AND PUT HIM ON
THE CIRCUIT COURT, THEN THE
PRESIDENT WHO STUCK BY HIM AND
NOMINATED HIM AND STUCK BY HIM
AND THAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO
GOES NOW TONIGHT TO KANSAS FOR A
RALLY WITH A SIGNIFICANT
CAMPAIGN PROMISE KEPT AND ALSO
JUST A UNIFIED REPUBLICAN PARTY
UNLIKE WE HAVE SEEN IN POSSIBLY
10 YEARS.
CHRIS:  DANA, I WANT TO ASK YOU
ON A KIND OF PERSONAL LEVEL
ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH BECAUSE
YOU DID WORK WITH HIM IN THE
BUSH 43 WHITE HOUSE AND FOR
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN
FOLLOWING HIM IN PUBLIC ON TV,
THERE REALLY HAVE BEEN THREE
BRETT KAVANAUGHS WE'VE SEEN.
FIRST OF ALL, THE LEGAL SCHOLAR,
IMMENSELY COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING
JUDICIAL DECISIONS, RULINGS,
PRECEDENTS AND HIS ORIGINAL
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BRIEFING,
THEN THE INTERVIEW WITH OUR
COLLEAGUE, MARTHA McCALLUM
WHERE HE SEEMED VERY
CONSTRAINED, VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,
UNDERSTANDABLY SO, DEALING WITH
THE CHARGES AND THEN THE KIND OF
KAVANAUGH UNPLUGGED THAT WE SAW
IN HIS SECOND JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE TESTIMONY WHEN HE WAS
VERY FIERY AND REALLY TOOK ON
THE DEMOCRATS IN A VERY
CONTENTIOUS WAY.
YOUR VIEW, WHICH IS THE REAL
BRETT KAVANAUGH?
>> WELL, I THINK, LOOK, HE'S A
TOTAL HUMAN, RIGHT.
THE FULL SPECTRUM.
ESSEX SEEDINGLY GRACIOUS, ALSO
AN EXCEEDING INTELLECTUAL.
I REMEMBER ONE THING, CHRIS, IN
2005 I WAS A SPOKESPERSON FOR
JOHN ROBERTS.
HE HAD JUST BEEN NOMINATED TO
REPLACE JUSTICE SANDRA DAY
O'CONNOR WHO IF YOU REMEMBER,
SHE RESIGNED AND IT WAS QUITE A
SURPRISE TO EVERYONE BUT
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH HAD A
LIST OF POSSIBLE NOMINEES.
JOHN ROBERTS WAS A CHOICE.
I REMEMBER AS A PRESS OFFICER I
WAS GETTING SO MANY QUESTIONS,
SO MANY HE LEGAL QUESTIONS, I
COULDN'T ANSWER.
I'LL NEVER FORGET, IT WAS A
FRIDAY NIGHT, AROUND 7:30 P.M.,
IF YOU EVER WAITED TABLES, I
FELT I WAS IN THE WEEDS, THERE
WERE TOO MANY REQUESTS, YOU
DON'T WHAT TO DO WITH THEM.
ABOUT 7:30 AT NIGHT, I WENT TO
THE STAFF SECRETARY'S OFFICE, I
WAS STILL THERE AND I SAID I'M
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, BRETT, BUT
I NEED HELP.
HE SAT WITH ME FOR ABOUT AN HOUR
AND 30 MINUTES AND EXPLAINED TO
ME ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT CASES
I WAS BEING ASKED ABOUT, ONE OF
THEM BEING ROE V WADE AND THE
RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND THE COMPLEX
THERE AND EXPLAINING HOW THIS
HAPPENED IN THE SUPREME COURT
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
AND THEN YOU COULD GO OUT WITH
HIM AT NIGHT AND HAVE A GOOD
TIME AND A LAUGH.
