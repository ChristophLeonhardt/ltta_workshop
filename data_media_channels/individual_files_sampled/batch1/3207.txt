I choked me up every time when I hear stories of sacrifice and so I seek them out I seek out those people and I seek out those stories because it gives me fuel to keep doing what I do well there's many lessons we can learn from the Marine Corps the title of the book leaders eat last came from a conversation I actually had with a Marine was a three-star general who's in charge of all Marine Corps training officer and enlisted they have to asked him when I was when I was talking to him a very simple question what makes Marines so good at what they do and he adds it simply officers any last and if you visit any chow hall on any Marine base anywhere in the world what you will see when they eat at Chow time is that all the Marines were lying up in rank order the most junior marine will always be first the most senior marine will always eat last no order is given there is no rule that says they have to do this and nobody tells them they have to it's one of the funny ways that it manifests when we see their perspective on leadership how it shows up it's just one of funny ways it shows up because they view leadership as a responsibility not as a rank it's not about being in charge it's about taking care of those in your charge that's what leadership really is and the Marines embody it as a culture it's sort of kind of amazing to see actually you
