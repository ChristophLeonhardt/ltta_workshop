so I've given this advice to Democrats and President Obama many times before they never listened never agree with a Republican they will only use it against you so I have the perfect example of that today so during the election the intelligence agencies come to President Obama and they say the Russians are trying to interfere in the election it looks like they want to cause chaos they're also against Hillary Clinton and it appears they're in favor of Donald Trump now we're telling you they're trying to interfere in the election so what does Obama do instead of going out and telling everybody about that he does what is the responsible thing to do he calls in congressional leaders including Republicans and he says look the intelligence agency says we're in trouble the Russians are trying to interfere in this 2016 election and what would you guys like to do about it and Mitch McConnell says nothing he's the leader of the Republicans in the Senate he says don't you dare say that in public we will not back you on it Obama says put Mitch you you heard it from the intelligence agencies yourself you know that it's true she's like he's like yeah that might be the case but if you say it we'll say you're rigging the election in favor of Hillary Clinton and you're biased and that you're against Donald Trump and you're the one who interfered an election so Obama being of course who he is would say it I won't say in fact James call me of all people wanted to write an op-ed about that and Obama's team blocked him from talking about today so don't talk about it there are publicans will get angry with us and say that we're biased so momma doesn't do anything okay now you might know that part of the story so why do I bring it up today because Donald Trump in his weird White House lawn discussion yesterday with the press when asked about rush inclusion said oh no it's not me it's Obama what so he said this quote you know Obama was told by the CIA or somebody FBI about Russia he didn't do anything about it how come he never gets blamed in other words because Obama listened to the Republicans that agree with the Republicans not to tell the American people before the election that Russia was trying to help Trump Trump now turns around and blames Obama for and goes oh well I guess I should have told you he didn't tell you so I guess he's the problem and he's the one that has the issue with the Russians during the election not me never agree with a Republican they will always use it against you I've given you hundreds of examples of this hundreds might be a bit much but certainly dozens throughout the years on the show and this is just another example of it so Democrats for God's sake stop trying to look for stupid bipartisan compromises the Republicans are not interested in compromises anytime you agree with it they will use it later as a bludgeon against you and say hey it was a Democrat who did it it was the Democrats who did it and this is the most extreme example but they'll do it again and again and again I have a different idea a radical idea how about this you're in the opposite party you fight them instead
