1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,810
THE SPANISH REGION OF
CATALONIA HELD A REFERENDUM

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,130
RECENTLY, OVER THE PAST WEEKEND
AND THE REFERENDUM OF COURSE HAS

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,869
TO DO WITH THE IDEA OF
SEPARATING FROM SPAIN AND

4
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:14,299
THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF
MADRID.

5
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:18,300
BEFORE I GIVE THE DETAILS ON HOW
THAT REFERENDUM WENT AND THEN

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,520
SAY NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE
INJURED DUE TO POLICE BRUTALITY,

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,350
I WANT TO SHARE THE MOST RECENT
UPDATE WHICH INVOLVES THE

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,110
KING OF SPAIN AND A VERY RARE
SPEECH THAT HE GAVE TODAY WHICH

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,870
WAS RATHER FORCEFUL IN REGARD TO
BEING AGAINST THE SEPARATISTS

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:47,170
AND MAKING STATEMENTS CALLING
FOR UNITY 

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,579
IN SPAIN.

12
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:58,680
HE ALSO SAID:

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,620
QUICKLY LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
ECONOMIC ISSUES AT PLAY HERE.

14
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,150
IF CATALONIA WERE TO SEPARATE
FROM SPAIN, SPAIN WOULD LOSE

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,210
20% OF ITS ECONOMY.

16
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,140
SOME OF ITS MOST WEALTHY PEOPLE
LIVING CATALONIA.

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,780
THERE IS AN INCOME OR WEALTH
WRISTER REDISTRIBUTION ISSUE

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,270
THERE WERE THESE WEALTHY EARNERS
OBVIOUSLY PAY MORE IN TAXES.

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,500
THOSE TAXES ARE REDISTRIBUTED TO
THE POOR COMMUNITIES AMONGST THE

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,930
SPANISH AND ANOTHER THING TO
KEEP IN MIND IS THAT CATALONIA

21
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:36,600
ACTUALLY OWNS A HUGE PORTION OF
THE PUBLIC DEBT AND ONE

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,630
PROBLEM IS THAT THEY SEPARATE,
THEY WOULDN'T BE ALL

23
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,230
BEGINNING TO PAY THAT DEBT TO
THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.

24
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:52,720
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES
AT PLAY HERE.

25
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:05,850
I WANT 
TO BE CLEAR ABOUT

26
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,850
SOMETHING.

27
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,870
ALTHOUGH THE DAY THAT THEY
VOTED, UNFORTUNATELY ENDED

28
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,480
IN TURMOIL AND VIOLENCE MAINLY
BECAUSE OF THE POLICE

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,030
RESPONSE TO THOSE PROTESTERS,
TODAY WAS LARGELY PEACEFUL.

30
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,420
IS SEEMS MORE AS A CELEBRATORY
DAY AS OPPOSED TO A DAY MET WITH

31
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,540
VIOLENCE SO HERE IS SOME VIDEO
KIND OF SHOWING YOU WHAT IT

32
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,590
LOOKED LIKE AND THESE ARE
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AGAIN,

33
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,920
CALLING FOR THE SEPARATION OF
CATALONIA FROM SPAIN.

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,760
THE PEOPLE OF CATALONIA AND
PROTESTERS OR VOTERS WERE

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,760
NEVER VIOLENT.

36
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,620
IT WAS THE COPS
WHO WERE VIOLENT AND OFTEN,

37
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,150
THE STATE STRUT THE WORLD WILL
DO THIS.

38
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,580
THEY WILL SAY, WE ARE WORRIED
ABOUT THE VIOLENCE.

39
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,850
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO IS VIOLENT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

40
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,500
LOOK, THE COURT IN SPAIN SAID
THAT THIS BUT WAS NOT LEGAL.

41
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,190
I AM NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERT
IN FATE SPAIN, SO I DON'T KNOW

42
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,569
IF THAT IS TRUE OR UNTRUE, IF
THAT WAS A CORRECT RULING OR NOT

43
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,550
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE
GOVERNMENT'S REACTION WAS

44
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,900
DISASTROUS SO IF THE VOTE IS NOT
LEGAL ANYWAY AND THE COURT

45
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,440
SEVERAL THAT IT IS NOT VALID,
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO IN

46
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,270
THERE WITH BATONS AND SHOOTING
RUBBER BULLETS AT PEOPLE

47
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,680
WHO ARE TRYING TO VOTE AND
GRABBING THEM BY THE HAIR

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,660
AND DRAGGING THEM OUT OF THE
VOTING BOOTH .RU INSANE?

49
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,540
WHAT A TERRIBLE
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE RESPONSE.

50
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,910
WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT
YOUNG, HEALTHY PEOPLE THAT

51
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,940
WERE MET WITH VIOLENCE.

52
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,160
THERE WAS FOOTAGE SHOWING
ELDERLY PEOPLE BEING DRAGGED OUT

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,410
OF THE VOTING BOOTH AND THAT
TYPE OF BEHAVIOR WHICH WAS

54
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,790
UNCALLED FOR AND THERE WERE EVEN
SOME OF THE SEPARATIST LEADERS

55
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,770
WHO ADMITTED TO THE PRESS THAT
THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A NONBINDING

56
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,650
VOTE CONSIDERING HOW THE COURTS
HAVE REACTED TO IT BUT THE

57
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,350
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF SPAIN
REALLY REACTED AGGRESSIVELY

58
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,260
TO THIS REFERENDUM.

59
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,410
GOING BACK TO THE REFERENDUM,
WHAT HAPPENED?

60
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,661
ABOUT 42% OF VOTERS SHOWED UP TO
THE POLLS WERE PART OF THE

61
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:56,060
REASON WHY VOTER TURNOUT WAS
SO LOW WAS BECAUSE OF THE

62
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:06,930
INTIMIDATION TACTICS BY SPAIN'S
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.

63
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,540
BECAUSE OF THE POLICE VIOLENCE
AROUND ALMOST 900 PEOPLE WERE

64
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,239
INJURED AND THAT IS ACCORDING TO
CATTLE ON OFFICIALS.

65
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,399
IF YOU WANTED TO BE THE POINT
MAKE THE POINT, DON'T WORRY,

66
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,900
SPAIN IS A DEMOCRACY IN YOUR FOR
FULL FREEDOM OF YOUR RIGHT START

67
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,630
YOU PICKED A CURIOUS WAY TO DO
IT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO BOW?

68
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,000
BY THE DOORS, RIP OF THE
BALLOTS, BEAT THE PEOPLE UP

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
YOU ARE TRYING TO VOTE.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,010
THAT IS NOT A WINNING STRATEGY
TO WIN HEARTS AND MINDS.

71
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,050
ESPECIALLY IF YOU CLAIM TO
VALUE DEMOCRACY BECAUSE

72
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,419
THAT MEANS THAT ANYONE YOU
DISAGREE WITH, YOU WILL

73
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:45,480
MEET THEM WITH VIOLENCE.

74
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,220
THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY.

75
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,800
SO LOOK, IS A VERY HARD ISSUE
AND IT IS AN ISSUE THAT A

76
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,880
LOT OF COUNTRY STRUGGLE WITH.

77
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,340
IN THE CASE OF SPAIN, THEY 17
DIFFERENT REGIONS.

78
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,520
THEY ALL BREAK UP, IF CATALONIA
GOES, GOD KNOWS WHO GOES NEXT.

79
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,180
THE UK HAS TO DEAL WITH THIS WAS
SCOTLAND FROM TIME TO TIME.

80
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,980
THERE ARE PLENTY OF COUNTRIES
WITH POLICE HAVE TO DEAL

81
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,980
WITH THIS.

82
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,600
IT'S AN ISSUE WE HAVE TO GRAPPLE
WITH IS THE WORLD AND THERE

83
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,530
ARE NO EASY ANSWERS BUT I KNOW
WHAT THE ANSWER ISN'T WHICH

84
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,680
IS VIOLENCE BY THE STATE.

85
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,570
LET THEM HAVE THEIR VOTE AND
THEN ADJUDICATE LEADER LEE

86
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,460
WHETHER IT IS VALID OR NOT.

87
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,220
LET THE CONSEQUENCES FLOW FROM
THERE.

88
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,590
IT MIGHT TURN OUT THAT YES, SOME
COUNTRIES THAT WE ARE USED

89
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,020
TO WIND UP BREAKING APART AND
GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER

90
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,949
AND LATER, THEY MIGHT COME BACK
TOGETHER.

91
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,889
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE.

92
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:39,400
I KNOW GOES BACK AND FORTH.

93
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,720
THERE WERE ENDLESS WARS IN
EUROPE.

94
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,520
HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF WAR,
THOUSANDS, ONE WAR WAS

95
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,770
LITERALLY HUNDRED YEARS AND THEN
THEY CAME BACK TOGETHER IN

96
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,132
THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NOW
AGAIN, THE UK LEAVING.

97
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:58,080
THE ANSWER IS DEFINITELY NOT
VIOLENCE, IT IS DEMOCRACY

98
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,150
AND A LEGAL PROCESS.

99
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,650
IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR DEMOCRACY
IN YOUR LEGAL PROCESS, LET

100
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,370
THAT RAIN AND THEN YOU MIGHT
HAVE MORE CREDIBILITY WITH

101
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,530
THE PEOPLE OF CATALONIA.

102
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,400
AND JUST A QUICK, AS I DO
WANT TO DO THE STORY JUSTICE.

103
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,230
JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME HISTORICAL
CONTEXT, THIS IS NOT AN

104
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,710
ISSUE THAT JUST AROSE.

105
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,270
THERE WAS A SIMILAR
THOUGH BACK IN 2014

106
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,840
AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO
DID MAKE IT OUT TO THE

107
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,630
POLLS WERE LARGELY IN FAVOR OF
SEPARATING.

108
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,120
THE REGION HELD A SYMBOLIC
POLL IN 2014 IN WHICH 80%

109
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,699
OF VOTERS BACKED COMPLETE
SECESSION BUT ONLY 32%

110
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,620
OF THE ELECTORATE TURNED OUT.

111
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,090
THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT IS
ARGUING THAT OUR

112
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,950
CONSTITUTION INDICATES THAT IF
YOU WANT TO SEPARATE, IF YOU

113
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:45,710
WANT TO DO THIS, YOU NEED OPEN
AT THAT VOTE TO ALL SPANIARDS.

114
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,850
THEY MENTIONED THE SPANISH
CONSTITUTION IN ORDER TO MAKE

115
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,050
THAT ARGUMENT AND IT WAS REVISED
IN 1978 BUT THERE WAS ALSO

116
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,060
SOMETHING SUPER INTERESTING THAT
HAPPENED IN THE EARLY 2000S.

117
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,620
BACK IN 2006, THERE WAS
ESSENTIALLY AN AGREEMENT BY THE

118
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,280
PARLIAMENT IN SPAIN AND
CATALONIA THAT CATALONIA

119
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,780
WOULD BE ITS OWN SEPARATE NATION
BUT THEN FOUR YEARS LATER,

120
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,270
THE COURTS CAME IN AND THEY ARE
LIKE, NO.

121
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,770
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

122
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,761
SO THEY ESSENTIALLY SAID, YOU
GUYS ARE, CATALONS ARE

123
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:23,280
NATIONALITY, BUT YOU ARE NOT
YOUR OWN NATION AND SO IT HAS

124
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,400
GONE BACK AND FORTH FURTHER
IRRITATING PEOPLE AND

125
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,680
FRUSTRATING PEOPLE SO AS CENK
UYGUR MENTIONED IT IS A

126
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,759
DIFFICULT SITUATION,
BUT THAT IS

127
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,170
CURRENTLY WHAT IS GOING ON IN
SPAIN RIGHT NOW.

128
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,449
AND FRANCO BACK IN THE DAY,
OPPRESSED CATALONIA AND THAT IS

129
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,530
HOW IT STARTED IN THE FIRST
PLACE.

130
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,310
LET'S NOT MAKE THAT

131
00:07:45,310 --> 00:00:00,000
MISTAKE.
