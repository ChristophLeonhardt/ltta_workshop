Donald Trump has been sued for blocking people on Twitter now the government is not supposed to violate First Amendment rights and it appears in this case by blocking certain individuals who criticize Trump he is violating their First Amendment rights at least that's the argument of a lawsuit that was brought before this judge now the federal judge heard the case against Trump for banning followers and suggested a settlement the president should simply mute Twitter followers that annoy him rather than block them entirely manhattan federal judge naomi rice Buckwald told the attorneys that resisting the settlement could actually result in the establishment of a new law they might regret so I think it's an interesting suggestion and I mean when you mute someone obviously you never see what they tweet to you and it's probably a better way to go about things because some people you know love getting blocked like they think that that's like a badge of honor which is hilarious but nonetheless he's still normal no but he's still doing what people are suing him for mm yeah I mean it's a slight difference because they're saying that Americans have a right to know what the president is saying right just turn on TV you're gonna be okay but but technically I get it right and the president doesn't normally communicate through Twitter but this guy does and so when he blocks you you can't see what the president is saying and the policies that he's saying when you get muted then it's it's more of a First Amendment issue to it to Anna's point right now when you speak back to the government and you know seek redress of your grievances which is in the First Amendment you can't get them because he muted you so it's not a great solution either way but I mean we're having preposterous this is conversations about what the president's doing on Twitter is it this is the most 2018 story I think that could ever exist I mean this was like this is straight out of an onion headline from like a year like it's like it's like a judge lecturing the president well actually a better strategy to do what Twitter is to mute people instead of blocks like it it's like it's just it's so bizarre and so like postmodern surreal that you know this idea that that of the president is like going through his men cheese you know I don't I don't like you you it's amazing that's what's happening and he cares about it like the idea that Obama would have time to go through his mentions and block people that he said Jimmy doors annoying me right he's wasting his day go to his mentions that's his saying I don't understand it I feel like the President of the United States should be the busiest person in the United States I don't I don't have time to go through my mention first of all I don't like Twitter so I try to avoid it anyway but I also know that you know social media you know is important for your career so sometimes I'm like alright today I'm gonna be more active on social media but there's no time there's no time and I do an Internet show like how does the president the United States have time for this it's crazy and the fact that they say that that's his personal account he's always tweeting about stuff that is not personal I have to do with the government of government and our you know our best interest or our whatever oh this is ridiculous policies why do we have to have this conversation about the president and his Twitter that's good it's good yeah you got to drink it in so I saw an episode of black mirror where they had developed a technology where you could actually block people in real life i spooked the hell out of me I was like oh Jesus that sounds really bad then I can't talk to them that would drive me crazy right and I almost never get blocked for whatever reason or I do and I don't notice it on Twitter because I'm very polite on social media gracious man that's a very genteel but the other day governor Howard Dean blocked me yeah that's a badge of honor I always say that I'm proud of you yeah I'm proud of you because he is the biggest sellout of all time my god I know well that's been s is what I call it which apparently he didn't really actually me Howard Dean please plan anyway when he did though I was like okay but then I can't see what you're saying so isn't that kind of your loss right all right now that a toss okay you shut off um my access to your brilliant ideas wow what a big loss to me so but that's like like nonsense punditry going back and forth but the president's taking it so seriously word cord over it that's what happens in the White House what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it you get a completely ad free if you could become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network calm slash join
