hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle descending into tribalism and cultural trench warfare a highly contentious Brett Cavanaugh Supreme Court nomination process has ignited passions and anger on both sides of the aisle interestingly and ironically the point where there is wide agreement is the recognition the status quo is deeply flawed and sadly with no way out crosstalking America's chaotic politics I'm joined by a guest Daniel Lazar in New York he's an author and a freelance journalist who writes frequently about the Middle East Eastern Europe and the US Constitution in Philadelphia we have Kathleen Arnett she is a veteran and political commentator and in Los Angeles we have ron pollack own he is a comedian frequent guest on the jimmy dore show and the young turks as well as host of his own streaming show get your news on with Ron all right crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate it well Ron you know I'm gonna go to you first because I always go to the person that got up earliest for this program and I mean Los Angeles and you look great I think you got a lot of coffee in you I came across an article here white women come get your people they will defend their privilege to the desk it was about by a woman named Alexis Grinnell and she writes white women benefit from patriarchy by trading in their whiteness to monopolize resources for mutual gain white women are expected to support the patriarchy by marrying within their racial group I could go on and on this is gobbledygook but it's in the New York Times this sounds like progressive racism or progressive tribalism take your pick what do you think Ron well I'm not familiar with that article I've never read that article so I can't really speak much to an article I haven't read sense of it I gave you a sense of it sure yeah I mean I I don't yeah I don't really know like what that is supposed to get at that oh you you have to benefit from the patriarchy or this or that or you have to yeah I mean I again I'd have to read the full article to have a way to speak on it but but yeah I mean as far as tribalism goes I mean I do think we're in an age of ultra tribalism on all sides of the aisle on the establishment side and then over on the right as well and and then and then some on the left too so and as a result it seems like we're kind of in we're kind of stuck in neutral as a country okay Kathy I don't think so I don't think the word that neutral is appropriate it's deadlock and it's getting worse and worse Kathy you wanted to jump in there that's the whole point point of the program go ahead yes I do because I did read much of that article yesterday and every single sentence was inflammatory and graces talk about the intolerant of the tolerant quote/unquote left but I'm you know if I recall correctly she even went on to say that that that trying to equate a man who was falsely accused of rape is not the equivalent of a woman who was actually been raped or a woman who is alleging that she's been raped what kind of universe is that what she was trying to insinuate is that is not to say being falsely accused of raping someone is not the same as someone who has been raped or someone who is alleged to have been raped that's upside down it is just as detrimental to a young man or any man being a cute falsely accused of rape as it would be but only in a leftist liberal progressive sloppy thinking kind of society will they try to put the same and say listen if you're you know it's okay to be falsely accused because we're making up for all the time women have had to condescend themselves in this culture and that's good and that's the craziness of the left okay well you Kathy you brought up the word craziness here let me go to Daniel here I mean you've written about this here I mean what it counts for you know after the process after the nomination process was complete then we started a completely different asymmetrical process that is not founded in law and not even in common sense but this simply rage this is what we're seeing is rage in its it's not it's mindless rage I would say go ahead Daniel well first of all I agree with Kathy except for one point what she's describing is really is truly crazy but it's not left-wing craziness it's an example of how the Democrats and liberals and feminists are rushing to the right they're engaged and I headlong race to the Republicans to see who can get to the right fastest real leftists believe and uphold very strongly with the principles of due process and the assumption of innocence and I agree totally that a false accusation is very bad and if whether it involves rape or or anything else doesn't matter at all it's very important to a to withhold judgement until all the facts are in so that nobody is falsely accused now what we're seeing in America we're seeing an epic breakdown in politics America has a very old system of government it's actually the oldest nation on the face of the earth its government dates back to 1787 when Catherine the Great was still alive for example there was still a holy roman empire they were still at papal state in a in italy and they were still a monarchy in france that form of government is with us still today largely to a great degree unchanged and it is an epic breakdown and as it breaks down the country is going mad and all kinds of crazy currents are being unleashed and that includes this kind of weird strange tribalism and bizarre logic which says the false accusation is okay if it involves rape that's just completely bonkers but that's where American politics are heading okay go ahead Kathy real quick you want to jump in there go ahead yeah I just want to put a period or comma here anyway and that is to say I think we really have to get our minds around where the Democratic Party was trying to take us back to with this Cavanaugh hearing for example whether some want to say they were trying to take us back to the days of McCarthyism where a whispering of an allegation could literally destroy your life or some may say trying to take those back to the dark days of Jim Crow law I grew up in the very deep south and I remember the stories of for example Emmett Till a young black boy who was brutally beaten drug dragged behind a truck in huh because a white woman made a false allegation and he was trying to talk to her or in Alabama the nine scottsboro boys black boys aged 13 to 25 of them who received the death sentence because two white women falsely accused them of raping them and this is and this is where the Democratic Party the radical Democratic Party the radical left was trying to take us back to you is where without due process without the presumption of innocence somewhere life could be utterly let me and let me go to Los Angeles Ron how do you are you a democratic party but Peter okay Daniel real quick and they will go to run the Democratic Party is not a radical Left Party sorry well that's really the point Ron the unit got up really early for this dinner okay Ron a lot has been said going go ahead and me a crowd go ahead yeah I kind of echo yeah the Democratic Party is not a radical Left Party they're not even a Left Party and in my opinion I would describe them as a center-right party and III think that's kind of the when I say were in neutral you know that's kind of what I'm referring to you know going forward when when you're looking towards the midterms you know people are saying there's gonna be some blue wave I do think that Trump fatigue is gonna be enough to pick up a little on the Democratic side but as far as framing a message and framing policy positions and and framing what is an actual opposition the Democratic establishment has not done that they largely have not done that so when you don't really have a real opposition in our politics which I would say at the establishment level we really don't have you know you just kind of have the nonstop echoes fear of a media that we have yeah well Daniel is absolutely right and Ron and Kathy here I mean the Democratic Party isn't a radical party but it is embracing these radicals their tactics and their rhetoric okay because I think they're afraid of it it is well okay I think it Kathy brought up McCarthyism Amy this is what's going on there's very few people willing to stand up to what it's really mob politics by fringe groups okay go ahead Daniel yes go ahead Daniel yes I mean but it's it's not it's when you say it's radical it's important to emphasize it's it's radical in the sense of the radical right the the Democrats are essentially adopting right-wing neo McCarthyite policy yes in which they are tossing out the presumption of innocence overboard this is very dangerous they are a center-right party which is moving further to the right so we have two right-wing parties and the country is galloping to the right the same way Brazil is okay this is completely outrageous to tart part are the left with this okay hang on Kathy hang on the Skype there is a little dodgy there a big Kathy I think what Daniel is saying is they both parties are adopting the same kind of tactics I think that is very very true okay oh oh absolutely absolutely meaning is resistance oppression you mean like on a fast track 15 of his judges so they could go on vacation sooner that's the type of resistance you're referring to hang on guys don't talk over each other Ron you get the last 20 seconds before the break go well hey it's early where I'm at the idea that the Democrats are really resisting Trump I think is nothing short of absolutely comical they're assisting him in so many ways well you are living in LA politics I'm going to jump in here after a short break we'll continue our discussion on chaotic politics day with RT welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle Germans were discussing chaotic politics okay let me go back to Daniel here let me another quote for the program here that was it came out on Twitter here and one of the writers for the not-so-funny Late Show with Stephen Colbert a woman named Ariel Dumas wrote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Cavanaugh's life reenact to that Daniel I mean is that juvenile and destructive mindless and really unhelpful it's really mean-spirited I think that's what I see when I see a good part of the left go ahead Daniel well first of all I wouldn't agree this woman is on the left but I certainly agree that it's it's mindless mean-spirited vindictive etc but the point is is that you know is that it's replacing it has replaced any kind of substantial discussion as to west of what really ails this country American government isn't break down not because the Donald Trump or because of Brett Kavanaugh it's breaking down because it's ancient constitutional machinery is breaking down Americans think they live in a democracy they really live in a minority dictatorship with this ancient Constitution essentially empowers minorities in the electoral college the Senate the House of Representatives to lord it over the great majority of Americans who want a more sane Society now this is the really important point and Ron's point about the resistance is actually absolutely correct the only resistance we see out there is that the Democrats are mobilizing the CIA and FBI in order to attack Trump from the right by stirring up war fever against Russia it's utterly nuts it's destructive and it's only gonna have negative consequences let me go back to Ron in Los Angeles you know one of the reasons why I like having you on Ron because you're what we are one of the people that are progressive that always talks policy and that's where I think conversations get very very interesting you can disagree but you can you can hash it out here this is what this atmosphere right now I don't see any talk of policy in a serious way I tend to think because many on the left don't have any policies don't have any real strongly ideas on how to move forward because Trump has just blinds their blinds their thought processes okay and it's it's a lot simpler and easier just to say it's Brett Kavanaugh is a bad person all white men are part of the patriarchy I mean that gets really stimulates a lot of people because it sounds cool but it's vacuous it really means nothing and it's just a form what I would call of hate speech go ahead Ron well I mean yeah you haven't seen much policy talk since 2016 I mean I mean you you really haven't and Democrats really haven't kind of taken they taken an autopsy of the whole situation I'm no fan of Cavanaugh but I think he was an awful choice I wish he wouldn't have been confirmed at all but you know you didn't see much policy talk the same as you know everything that's been going on in the past with judges and I think it's because Democrats don't really have and when I say Democrat I'm talking about at the establishment level there are some diamonds in the rough there are some people that are you know proposing some great ideas but those people are in the minority in the party and they're always expected to bend the knee to the establishment instead of the establishment coming to them and saying hey how can we keep our jobs because people aren't happy with us what can we do to keep our jobs it's not working that way it's working the other way around it's hey you have some good progressive ideas well we don't want to do that and bend the knee to us or you're out of here it's completely backwards Nancy Pelosi not too long ago said if you know if the Democrats get a lot of power in the midterms they wouldn't still Pago meaning that every time you wanted to do a policy you would have to pay for it with some other cut that basically kneecaps the idea of any progressive policies like single-payer health care you know like a jobs program living wages anything like that it kind of kneecaps that entire idea and that's what 92% of the base once you know Kathy one of the things that's so disturbing here is that we see the Democrats and men and mothers on the Left that essentially play are playing the race card the sex card and in anyone that disagrees with them because is Rhon points out there not too many people are talking about policy if you disagree you're a racist you're a xenophobe and you're a sexist that is not dialogue that is not a way to come to terms with the chaos it's all around us why do do you think the Democrats continue to play that card car yeah yeah let me just say all of that that you mention has been brought to us by the Democratic Party primarily but let me also say I was listening to Danielle a few moments ago and I feel as though in Tehran I feel as though I've somewhat walked into the twilight zone when you started talking about the the in efficacy of the Constitution let it be clear that America does not exist apart from the Constitution even our founder John Adams says the Constitution is made for a religious and moral people it's wholly inadequate for any other kind of people meaning people who understand the difference between right and wrong and most of the things that we're seeing that transpire in our country today where we're not talking about policies where we're not talking about that they well I'm sorry Donald Trump and many in the Republican Party are talking about policies when we talk about trade with China and the rest of the world that's policy when we talk about the NAFTA undoing NAFTA that's policy when we talk about how we're going to interact with Iran with other despot regimes like North Korea that's policy so even when we talk about securing our borders that's policy so the right represented by President Donald Trump is talking about policy all the time but then we have this you may not want to call it radical but there is a significant radical element when we have senator Hirono Democrat from Hawaii telling people that it's okay to get up in the faces of your elected official or basically anyone who doesn't agree with you and to resist them as Maxine Waters says to push back on them that's radical and that is what it was joy I don't know if it's radical but I'm sorry I'm certain that it's not productive Daniel and at all here what's really quite fascinating to me as the midterms approach is that it seems to me the Democrats are doing almost everything in their power to push people away from it because there is this perception that the party is radical or won't stand up to radicals I mean all you have to do is watch the the airwaves I mean you could watch CNN MSNBC and Fox News see the same pictures and people are going to come to very different conclusions that's one of the interesting thing times that we live in here you you could see the same things and draw radically different conclusions go ahead Daniel listen I I love to bash the Democrats as much as anybody I just hate the Democrats I loathe em despise them but we can't let the Republicans off scot-free the Republicans are a minority party that have used their constitutional advantages to grab control of all the major institutions in Washington and then now the Supreme Court they are using racial politics racial politics to to solidify their power Trump was elected by a minority the people he still grabbed power via the the electoral college the Senate as I said 54% of the country lives in ten states which are overwhelmingly Democratic but there are outvoted four to one by the 80% of lives in the other 40 states thanks to this ridiculous Senate concept of equal state representation and the Republicans have gerrymandered the house to the point where they now have an 11% advantage over the Democrats a built-in 11% advantage so these this minority party has now just captured control of the fourth branch or the fourth major institution the Supreme Court so don't tell me that Democrats are the ones solely guilty of using this kind of minority politics because the Republicans are playing the game even better okay I mean is it's very elegant eloquent but it's not true when we talked about the Supreme Court one of the importance of having Brett Kavanaugh confirm to the Supreme Court is that now Democrats primarily do not pass large sweeping legislations other than with the exception of Obamacare prior to Obamacare it is not within the repertoire of Democrats to cast large sweeping legislation to fundamentally change our nation is that they sidetrack the people they go straight to activist judges now that we have Cavanaugh on the Supreme Court who is a conclude this makes it decidedly conservative meaning that the the the Supreme Court will now interpret the Constitution not rewrite the Constitution and I do not believe that the Constitution is a living breathing document to be open and to be Neanderthal with at every generation disposal okay Ron it seems to me that you know both parties like the use of Constitution is a weapon and not as it was intended here I mean now we hear the Democrats if they get control of the house which is really kind of nonsensical then they're gonna try to pack the court where they couldn't even do that but I mean it says it seems to me there's a funnel misunderstanding of what the system should do and it's being being cherry picked for whatever partisan agenda you want to push go ahead run yeah well you know first of all I think Daniel and I kind of see eye to eye on some of the stuff that's going on contemporarily and I'm not used to anybody agreeing with me on this show Peter so I'm a little I'm a little weirded out I don't know where I fit in now but but yeah I think it's become you know the whole purpose of the Supreme Court is to you know hold up the law and then to you know give those interpretations when necessary and it seems that as of recent and maybe it's always been that way it's just you know we're seeing a much bigger light on it because of what's going on contemporarily but but it seems more as just a way to serve one political agenda or the other and that's not something I think well actually that's my point exactly here okay Daniel I gotta give you 20 seconds how to fix the system 20 seconds go great the law is unfair the law is unfair that the 50 dematerialize for Kavanagh represent less than 37 percent of the US population how is that fair how is that democratic the law is undemocratic the law has got to change this absurd 18th century Constitution has got to go Americans are the huddled masses of America are yearning to breathe free but this pre-modern Constitution won't allow that this is insane ok well then I say change the law legally and democratically and no revolution no revolution that's all the time we have folks ok many thanks to my gifts in New York Philadelphia and in Los Angeles and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember cross thought rules
