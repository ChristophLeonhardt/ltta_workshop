1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,840
“The piece of metal
that remains in my body

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,689
was meant to kill me.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:09,960
Suddenly, I was not
who I am.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,800
I was an
evidence locker.”

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,940
“Still have three bullets
inside of me

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,740
that doctors
did not remove.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,160
It can often do more
damage trying to

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,550
fish out all those pieces
than just leaving it there.”

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,162
“Here is this foreign object
in my body

10
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:27,312
that shouldn’t be there.”

11
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:28,232
“Gunman is on the loose —”

12
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:29,572
“Armed with a
Sig Sauer MCX rifle —”

13
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:30,572
“With an AR-15 —”

14
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,333
“And our hearts pour out
to the people in Florida —”

15
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,240
“Bullets started coming
through our classroom door

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,740
and then seconds later,
my whole body shook.

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,172
I was super curious to see
the pictures of what they took

18
00:00:43,172 --> 00:00:44,880
out of me when they
had surgery to remove

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,290
some of the fragments.

20
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,600
One of those is like clearly
the shell casing.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,610
The doctors show you
for a quick second

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,220
and then all that gets
given to the police.

23
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,560
You don’t even
get to keep it.

24
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,840
I mean, I’m not going to
make it into a necklace

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,960
or anything,
but I feel like

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,135
I carried it around in
my body for years,

27
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:02,155
that I should
be able to have it.

28
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:03,165
It’s mine.

29
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,494
Just last year —
10 years later —

30
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:09,910
I found out that some of the
bullet fragments on this side

31
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,250
had found their way
into my hip joint

32
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,420
and were causing the
lead levels in my blood

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,770
to elevate
to dangerous levels.

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,590
It just, like, kind of
deflated me.

35
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,670
I mean, it was like, you know —
I made all this progress.

36
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,600
I had this life.

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,050
I had a wife and kids.

38
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,410
Like, was totally moved on
and, like, doing well.

39
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,820
And now, it’s not over.

40
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,420
In fact, it’s this whole
other different problem.”

41
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,770
“It felt more like a bee sting
than anything else.

42
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,560
I actually didn’t
realize something

43
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,620
was wrong until I
had already picked

44
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,650
my 17-year-old daughter up,
thrown her against the wall

45
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,410
and covered her
with my body.

46
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,110
The bullet hit my rib
and it tracked around

47
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,520
until my spine.

48
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,770
It still causes quite a bit of
pain, especially if it moves.

49
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,970
I could have said, ‘This is
his rage inside my body.’

50
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,220
But I couldn’t
let it be there.

51
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:24,540
So I had to reimagine
that bullet as lucky

52
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,420
and a little bit
of a spark of life

53
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,290
inside me, encouraging me.”

54
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,105
“My leg started vibrating
and raised from the floor.

55
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,990
I was, like, laying
to the right.

56
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,950
I was, like, holding Martin,

57
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,540
so the bullets I received
in the left side.

58
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,620
I remember feeling
the left femur one

59
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,880
because it touched my femur
and exploded.

60
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,750
And he died next to me
on the floor.

61
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,450
I saw him die next to me.

62
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,390
You can see all
these little dots.

63
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,880
It looks like sand.

64
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,900
If they could take them out,

65
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,330
probably they would be more
easy to erase from my memory.”

66
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,725
“It just felt like
I was this, like,

67
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:31,175
warm ball of numbness.

68
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,510
I remember that day asking
for my friend’s phone

69
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,290
so that I could look at
myself in the face.

70
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,410
I had, like, blood down my face
and I had blood in my hair

71
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,780
and I couldn’t see
out of one of my eyes.

72
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,200
I remember looking at myself
and I was like,

73
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,120
‘Who is that?’

74
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,310
My body took all
of the shrapnel

75
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,850
from, like, the students —

76
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,480
the two students who were
shot and killed next me.

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,360
At one point, I
could like wiggle

78
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,390
around the piece of metal
that was above my lip.

79
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,790
I also have shrapnel
behind my right eye.

80
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,630
It kind of haunts my
dreams because like,

81
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,239
I’m scared that I’m going
to be, like, 40 years old

82
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,555
and I’m going to wake up

83
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,495
and I can’t see out of
one of my eyes.”

84
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,500
“I can instantly
go from chatting

85
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,270
with someone to
tears in my eyes

86
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,130
because the bullet
aggravated a nerve.”

87
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,170
“What happens to long-term
lead levels is super scary.

88
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,670
I mean, this is, like,
cognitive decline

89
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,920
and, like, neuro issues.”

90
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,240
“Aesthetically speaking,
it’s not a very visible thing.

91
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,146
But underneath the
surface, it is for me.

92
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:43,840
And I don’t really
care how many people

93
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,700
tell me I’m beautiful.

94
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,770
It doesn’t change
that feeling of not

95
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,480
belonging within your body

96
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,100
because it’s — it's not
who I was before.”

97
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,270
“The shooter —

98
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,440
I try to think that
he is a no one.

99
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,980
Like an individual
that doesn’t exist.

100
00:05:03,640 --> 00:00:00,000
And that’s how I
treat the bullets, too.”
