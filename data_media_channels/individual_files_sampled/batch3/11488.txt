kind of the cave max hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report I love nature I love spring I love these twigs and rocks and pinecones and makes me feel like I'm one with everything that's holy and pure innocent and lovely speaking of lovely let's talk to Stacy speaking of holy this is unholy the unholy snake ha ha you said you loved nature don't tread on me remember that flag with the snake on it there's something American about that I forget exactly the details but I learned about it in social studies class back in the 1960s I believe is what the Vermont or New Hampshire protested against the Vietnam War when I was 6 years old when you were sitting there in Washington I heard Martin Luther King speech in person on the plaza I was there at the moon landing in 1969 I was there Donna Summer first performed at Studio 54 I've been everywhere man I mean everywhere don't sing cuz that's the one that is the copyright terrorist of the world and they ruin all concepts my cover you know I want to talk about a few tweets oh they're interesting charts that we have here to go over and they're both of these charts that I'm gonna look at that are the content of this episode are from Adam twos maybe it's to Z Tuesday floozy Tuesday Tuesday well anyway he's a professor at Columbia University teaches history and he's the director of the European Institute and he had some charts that I found quite interesting and I retweeted them this week the divergence of prime age labor market participation between US and other key OCD economies is striking what is quite striking about that max do you see this this is from the blue line is the United States that's participation from 25 to 54 year-olds in the US labor market versus the United Kingdom Canada and Germany up there you know they keep on rising their employment rate keeps on going up while the US under Clinton late towards the late 90s it's just started plummeting and that's cuz all those other countries work for us we're retired we're just picking up the rent and all these other country's living away particularly in Britain that could be one solution and I'm gonna look at a possible solutions I found a bunch of charts to go with this one chart to try to find an explanation of what happened in the late 90s that could possibly explain why so many 25 to 54 year olds just dropped out of the labor market and decided not to work in the United States despite the fact that our you know developed country competitors in Germany Canada United Kingdom continued to rise as participation rates so they were increasingly participating in the economic system the globalized economic system and we were increasingly not so I want to look at I thought perhaps it could be you know the Economist did bring it up is that the the quantity the massive quantity of especially black men in prison so if you're in prison you can't participate in the official economy they do do a lot of free labor for certain corporations but that doesn't get counted and participating in the the jobs market so the United States leads incarceration rates this is a chart I looked I found and this compares it to Canada England which to Americans means the United Kingdom we call it England often here France Germany Italy Japan and China so you see the United States has a huge percentage of their population in prison so perhaps that's a reason why but no idea this was gonna come back to the black man the plight of the black man in America I mentioned to Martin Luther King at the top of the show and of course Dean you mentioned some of the things have been going on in prisons and abuse and all kind all manner of of open-air prison like situations one might find at the airport for example the TSA the TSA do I know I was abused my private parts poked in a way that made me feel violated and I made it known at the airport quite vocally anyway so the prison population problem in America the PPP's I called prison population problem is one that is deep-rooted in America's history and when I say that I'm referring of course to racism which in my view is still inculcated in the deepest possible roots of the American experience despite everyone's denial of it well let's look at data instead of like these crazy opinions perhaps you know tainted by your experience at the TSA so you know we're going back to that first chart that we should saw where a US labor participation rate has plummeted since the you know late 90s and here's the incarcerated Americans 1920 to 2014 and as you see it was basically from the beginning of the war on drugs under Nixon that it started to rise a bit and then it's shot up of course under Reagan when he started a real war on drugs but sort of to also privatize some of the prisons and then under Clinton of course about here you know it started to shoot up and he did all that welfare reform and all sorts of extending he introduced the extreme sentences on crack cocaine for example versus just ordinary cocaine for some reason you got like five times the prison sentence if you were a black in the hood and had more crack cocaine than versus cocaine so there was a discrepancy in sentencing that happened under Clinton perhaps that is part of the reason I take umbrage at this notion that I am trafficking in quote crazy theories when all I'm doing is repackaging and rephrasing the same data it's the same data it's not outside of what you just said I just said it in my own way now crack cocaine you know it's about on entrepreneurialism in Harlem when I was living up there you know they figured out that crack is a lot more profitable for the drug dealer than powder that's enterpreneurs oh ok well that's an idea but let's move on to another possible scenario that I looked at because of course I want to compare the u.s. to the competitors that there you know that the participation rate is not as high United States down Germany Canada and the UK higher a participation rate and the other idea I came up with is health care health care spending you and I have talked about Obama care you know after twenty years overseas we return here and it's quite a sticker shock to see that we were able to be treated fairly equally to all other members of society and France or the United Kingdom at the same rates we pay the same tax rate and we receive the same treatment here the United States there's not only a massive bureaucracy but a massive imbalance in terms of justice and injustice there so we'll pay we pay this year twenty six thousand four hundred and premiums but we still have five thousand dollars in deductible to even receive any treatment it seems like a lot of money right add that up because that's twenty six thousand four hundred just to get medical care and then five thousand on top of it so thirty one thousand dollars well if you earn under a certain amount you get it all free so that goes into your calculations of should I participate in the jobs market and earn forty thousand dollars but then I have to come up with thirty thousand for health care so I'm only up ahead eight thousand nine thousand dollars no I'll just like drop out and get Medicaid right having a job is bad for your health it is it makes it so much easier when the huge massive cost the ridiculous cost and I'm gonna show you two charts here to show you how ridiculous the charts are in the United States health care spending as a percentage of GDP you just looking at the chart this is only going up to two thousand seven that actually gets worse it's now seventeen over seventeen percent of GDP in the United States remember it was I think John McCain who called Russia you know a gas station operating as a nation where a health were a hospital operating pretending to be a nation so all of our costs 17 over seventeen percent of GDP is just health care spending and it's totally right it's an emergency care unit masquerading as a that's America so you're saying that the work of the working participation rate to huge contributors to this according to what you're pointing out here would be the incarceration rates which are very very high and the health care costs which have disincentivize people from working because the costs are outrageous you know to put this into context you're saying that we pay 26 to 31 thousand dollars a year for health care when we were living in France you know the average wage for the French worker is not much different than that so the average French worker who they would make in a year their total gross income just what we pay for this health care which actually doesn't provide health care because of the deductible yeah and as I have explained it to a few people imagine this this is the way health works in America it's a it's a protection racket so the actual cost for procedures they quote the insurers tens of thousands of dollars for a broken leg or some other procedure and then you buy this extortionary rate health care to insulate yourself from the Mafia from the mob and you are big if you don't have the protection you don't pay the protection you're exposing yourself to these exorbitant costs that are five six seven eight times what other people pay in other countries for the exact same procedures so they take the basic costs multiplied eight or nine times then they threaten you at that cost to bankrupt you unless you pay this extortionary health racket cost at a price that's beyond anything that would make any economic sense and it's driving people out of the workforce bankrupting the country and disenfranchising the car it's more than that because let's look at this other chart I had I said I had two charts related to health care this is annual per capita health care cost by age all these other countries are those competitors of ours Spain Sweden UK Germany red is the United States notice that that is all from especially 60 65 years old once people go on the free Medicare the taxpayer the government pays for your health care once you're retired and then people start consuming it out of control because those prices are also based on these so-called free market prices of the $31,000 a year as you see by the time you there 90 the average per capita spend here 90 years old person $45,000 a year the government is spending on them we pay 31,000 haven't been to the doctor in years but here so it's all going to the upper you know age groups and that is another unique trend in the United States is those post retirement post 65 year olds working they're entering the workforce at rates higher than the 25 to 54 year olds why because they already have health care they don't need to worry about shoddy health care products being offered by retail sector jobs and then also the employers especially if they have over 50 you know they have to buy Obama care standards they have to provide these the shoddy products as well so it costs them less to hire somebody who's on the free medical system that the taxpayer is paying for right so the total economics of it are akin to a dictatorship or a socialized system where free market capitalism is is not in evidence to whatsoever in other words they're they're fixing the price in distorting the market that's not free market capitalism if there is if the insurance companies were competing like the auto insurance industry why for $1,000 a year can I be protected against all these medical emergencies that take place in my car therefore we know that the price of having medical insurance would be $1,000 a year not $30,000 a year they're overcharging me by $29,000 where is that going it's going into Oleg arks American oligarchs yes and of course they are socialized systems in Germany France in the IKE Union which I like a third of the price of our system but I did say I have a two charts from Adam twos and this is a second one the disconnect between today's startup euphoria and actual rates of firm formation and the US economy is striking this is from powerless report by the Roosevelt Institute and the you know just a quick chart the start-up rates are actually declining rapidly since the 70s and despite all the zero percent interest rate despite all the free money despite the claims that this is too helped jobs and and you know corporations form and all this stuff there's actually a lower start-up right now right well I welcome when capitalism comes back into the system we gotta take a break we'll be back right after this don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to go to Craig hemp key of TF metals report Craig welcome back hi max hi Stacey all righty so Craig we've been tracking the silver market for years and we've been tracking JPMorgan of course we launched crashed JPMorgan by silver campaign a few years ago drove the price up to 50 right here on this very show you were a big part of that now JPMorgan is being positioned from 2 billion short ounces of silver to now they're huge buyers they're long silver in some big way Craig tell us what's happening well max I think to fully understand what you just mentioned you've got to go back to your by silver crash JPMorgan program if you will from 2011 because I think that's the genesis of where we stand today yeah you're right max if we go off of the cme silver stocks report which come out every night and again now they have a disclaimer on them that says yeah this may or may not be accurate but we'll go with it you go off those reports JPMorgan now has in their vault at the Comex about a hundred and forty-one million ounces of silver which is about 54 percent of the total vault but again to understand put that in context you got to go back to 2011 with what you mentioned then by silver crash JPMorgan program go if you go back to 2011 there's there's kind of a misconception out there seven years later of people that say oh that was all this massive speculative bubble where you know every shoeshine boy and taxi driver was buying silver futures and that's just not even remotely true in fact if you look at the data and again now this comes from the CFTC but if you look at that data the last month April of 2011 when price moved 25% higher from 38 to 48 was all on the backs of bank or commercial short-covering it wasn't specs buying the specs were getting out it was the banks that were short covering so going back to 2011 with the crash JPMorgan by silver idea right then we thought okay see this is JPMorgan with naked shorts getting squeezed and having to buy back there shorts in a higher price and again spiking the price 25% in a month then we know what happened actually at the May Day Massacre we had five margin hikes in nine days all of that stuff to help JPMorgan out well back at that same time in March of 2011 JPMorgan got a rush rush approval to open their own Comex silver vault because back in the day they didn't have one they didn't have any silver they were just naked short at least that's what we were speculating and as price was rising their risk of loss was was basically infinite to be short you know maybe 20,000 contracts of silver that's going up a dollar a day so they rectified that day they got this rush rush approval to open their own vault they started with nothing obviously in 2011 and now they're after 140 million ounces a lot of folks wonder why is that their own silver that sort of thing all we can go off of are these again the CME reports showing that in the period if I can go back to 2015 15 through 17 that three-year period JP Morgan took delivery of about 14,000 Comex silver contracts that's 70 million ounces into their house account okay so while they are the custodian of the SLV and and the prospectus of the SOB says they can hold SLB silver in New York pretty easy to say that at least half of that hundred forty million ounces is JP Morgan's their own and now going forward as they short silver manipulate and manage the price they've got these I don't know maybe a hundred million ounces backing their contracts that allows them to be short 20,000 contracts if price ever goes up they can just physically deliver it out and and be out of the game entirely and not have this open-ended risk like they had in 2011 I hope that kind of sums it up at least that's how I see it yeah yeah it's great I wonder how close we came to bankrupting JP Morgan and putting Jamie Dimon out onto the street we know that when they acquired Bear Stearns they inherited this enormous short position our investigative journalism kind of uncovered this vulnerability to their balance sheet we encouraged the world to buy ounces of silver it's a cross shape Morrigan and there was some collateral damage Blythe masters who was kind of the orchestrator the whole thing lost her job she kind of has buried herself in the crypto business now Jamie Dimon of course has had to issue a Mia culpa on the wall on the I think was the Financial Times he had to account for this massive vulnerability on his balance sheet and now they're in the business of acquiring silver which is great for silver it's honest money it's real money and you know they've had to take an enormous it to their balance sheet if they didn't get a free open spigot from the Fed what's free money at zero percent interest rates Jamie Dimon would be selling hot dogs in Central Park right now but because you've got that relationship with the New York Fed and the primary dealers and the system is rigged to support the dollar in a way that's unconscionable we know they're still breathing sadly now tell us about the revelations of some of the manipulations that have been going on the so-called the legend what's been revealed so far Craig well that now we're getting to the heart of the matter and how price is manipulated and ian's I'm glad you brought that up max because I've seen several I guess theories put out there now and they're kind of a revisionist history about what happened to the price of gold when it peaked out in September of 2011 and maybe we can we can touch upon that because of what you're pointing out is this article that came out late Friday talking about the spoof errs that Andre flow Tron guy from UBS and other guys at UBS and Deutsche Bank that were caught now red-handed spoofing manipulating massaging managing whatever you want to say the price of the precious metals acting coercively collusive lee to get that done uh that's kind of an a it's not a bets not a big scale thing though a lot of times that's just traders at these banks manipulating things back and forth and and working together to get it done but back in September of 2011 though it was there was a much bigger picture going on because when the price of gold peaked out at 1920 dollars an ounce on September the 6th of 2011 that was the same day that the Swiss announced they were pegging the franc to the euro and prior to that through August of 2011 there was his rush into safe havens because the US had budget crisis and the debt level was soaring and all this kind of stuff in the u.s. is a debt rating got cut and the only two safe havens left were the Swiss franc and gold and both were soaring well on the same morning that the Swiss went all-in and pegged their currency to the euro going forward we have this massive dump of like 50,000 contracts at about 2:00 in the morning New York time a smashed gold for 60 or 70 dollars and down it went from there and the rest is history and again to now people are trying to conflate that to the the lost my train of thought they're trying to conflate that to the gold forward rates and then the LIBOR rates and whether there was backwardation London and whether it was these traders that were spoofing yeah that all probably had something to do with it well when gold was smashed out on the heels of silver getting smashed it was definitely a central bank operation to keep gold price in check and to avoid a total loss in faith of global Fiat because there was no fiat left that deserted to have any faith in it right just to keep on this theme of spoofing for a second so you know the market has buyers and sellers and a spoofer will show up with a huge sell order you know that would cost the spoofer hundreds of millions of dollars to execute and they show the market this order that they are claiming to be a good order and they scare all the little guys into selling because they're like oh my god this freight train of a sell order is coming we better get out now and then they sell they take the economic loss and the spoofer just cancels their offer they cancel the sale they never had the intention of making good on that sale and that's been well documented hundreds of times there's no debate as to whether spoofing goes on a high-frequency traders use it to bilk markets and to steal cash for many years that no one doubts that no one questions that and people believe that the markets are made up of buyers and seller on a cash basis and that the price is purely a reflection of supply and demand when we know now conclusively and we'll say this emphatically once again that these prices are the result of phantom orders that represent no money and the regulator's are clearly in on it they simply have looked at it you know the regulator's over there at the CFTC looked at plain evidence Bill Murray over Agata showed them trade by trade tick for tick exact examples concrete smoking-gun evidence of manipulation and they were like the guy from the movie Casablanca who said I see no gambling going on in this establishment and then the guy another guy comes around and says Oh miss you here are your winnings you know in such a clear example of a captured regulator that we've never had it such an obvious example but they claim according to Alan Greenspan going back to some of his testimony when he was Federal Reserve Chairman back in the day he claimed to Congress that manipulation spoofing and and crookery was necessary to keep markets liquid so you know that's his rationality for maintaining a status quo of crooks is that what we need it for liquidity Craig your thoughts max that's just such a non-starter I mean hfts control everything all markets now and this claim at the end liquidity is a joke I mean the liquidity they add is a mile wide and six inches deep because it can all be canceled at a microsecond by these computers you know but getting back to the CFTC you know they had this this investigation allegedly for five years and whether silver was manipulated and as soon as the whistleblower showed up to give them the absolute proof they swept it all under the rug and closed it and then no I don't know what about two years later three years later there's a class-action suit in 2016 that finally it was allowed to go through again get into the legal discovery phase and that's how we found out about these chat rooms and the emails and everything else of these spoof errs and the other manipulators and it was only through that evidence that then the CFTC came out and find these guys about I don't six eight weeks ago maybe a little more than that late last year regardless the CFTC with five years somehow in there Inspector Clouseau fashion couldn't find anything but then as soon as you have presented as you say the contracts were cancelled in microseconds and you're not exaggerating there we're talking about a million trades per second and the technology for more trades per second keeps going higher really trying to defy the laws of the space-time continuum one can only think that as far as Goldman Sachs is concerned they'd like to take time and go backwards so that they can commit fraud in the past and book it on their balance sheet Craig we've got to take we got to leave actually can you stay for another segment sure no problem all right well thanks that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert in real time not in microseconds we don't spoof we give you the real deal when I catch us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
