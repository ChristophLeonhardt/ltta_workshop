1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,420
— Membership in The Democratic Socialists of America

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,100
recently reached 25,000—

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:13,640
more than tripling in size since Bernie Sanders’s
campaign brought the movement in from the fringe.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,480
But if the Socialist bloc wants to become
more than just a party of dissent,

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,080
they’ll need to appeal to some non-white demographics.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,700
That’s a problem facing many
alternative political groups on the left.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,580
— I graduated right into the recession.

8
00:00:33,589 --> 00:00:36,170
The economy was absolute crap, I couldn’t find a job.

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,180
I went to go apply for a job putting
labels on test tubes at a dentist office,

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,699
and then the person interviewed me said,

11
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:44,940
“I don’t know about this, I have people
with graduate degrees applying for this job.”

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,740
It’s for $12 an hour.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,620
— Jabari Brisport is running for
City Council in New York.

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,960
— What are these Republicans trying to do now?

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,700
— Kill us!

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,140
— Kill us, yes!

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,979
— Jabari was born in the district he’s running in.

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,140
His family has lived in the same
Brooklyn brownstone for 50 years…

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,500
— It is not okay to keep…

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,780
— …and he’s campaigning on a platform of police reform,
public school improvements and affordable housing.

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,620
— …housing is a human right!

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,260
— In most years, all that would add up to
a pretty compelling Democratic candidate.

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,260
But Jabari’s not running as a Democrat.

24
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,130
— I switched over to Green in June of last year.

25
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,020
I would say my dissatisfaction
started even, like, in Obama terms.

26
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,659
I mean, immediately after the bailout,

27
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,829
I was kind-of pissed that
I was seeing Wall Street bankers

28
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,920
reinvesting tax dollar money
into billion-dollar bonuses.

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,680
Then the Occupy Wall Street happened
and I started getting pushed further left,

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,120
and then, you know,
Black Lives Matter started picking up

31
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,860
and I started getting pushed further left,

32
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,000
until Bernie Sanders started
making socialism cool again.

33
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,880
— Thank you!

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,740
— Bernie lost the black vote nationwide
by a catastrophic margin,

35
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,900
with more than 75 percent casting their votes
for Hillary Clinton.

36
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,020
Bernie didn’t exactly help the cause with
a few well-publicized campaign gaffes.

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,720
— To answer your question:

38
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,620
when you’re white,

39
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,680
you don’t know what it’s like to be living in a ghetto,

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,800
you don’t know what it’s like to be poor.

41
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:09,820
— There were tiny imperfections
in his campaign with

42
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,960
his attempts to tie everything almost
into economic terms.

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,940
— But there’s some reason for optimism.

44
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,780
Bernie actually won black voters
under the age of 30 by five points—

45
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,960
fueled, in large part,

46
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,300
by prominent black figures like Erica Garner,
the daughter of Eric Garner,

47
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,520
and the rapper Killer Mike…

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,280
— Oh, I am truly, truly honored to be here.

49
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,340
— …both who questioned whether
mainstream Democratic politics

50
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,280
were working for the black community.

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,540
— Socialism, it’s not a dirty word anymore.

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,820
— What’s the reaction from people,

53
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,500
in this very historically Democratic district,
when you say that you’re a socialist?

54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,360
— They get a little wide-eyed,
and then they listen for my platforms—

55
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,440
I would like to fundamentally transform
our society and our economy

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,100
into one that is centered
around people’s needs, not profits.

57
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:04,000
— Jabari isn’t the only black third-party candidate
to come into prominence over the past year.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,320
This spring, Chokwe Antar Lumumba
became the Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi

59
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,360
running on a platform of
radical economic transformation.

60
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,020
Democratic Socialist Khalid Kamau was elected
to the City Council of South Fulton Georgia.

61
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,760
And in New York, Akeem Browder will be
running for Mayor on the Green Party ticket.

62
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,200
These new black leftist candidates might
only be running on a local level for now,

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,800
but third parties like the Green Party
and the Democratic Socialists of America

64
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,020
have thrown their support behind them.

65
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,320
— DSA’s super supportive. DSA made it rain.

66
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,140
It took me three months just to get to $10,000,

67
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,540
and then DSA sends out a fundraising email
before our deadline on Tuesday

68
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,870
and, like, 4, $5,000  came in in one day.

69
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,760
Which is insane.

70
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,920
— Here’s the district he’s running in—

71
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,800
it may be the best shot a leftist third-party candidate

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,960
has at winning a major political seat.

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,500
It includes several of Brooklyn’s
most quickly gentrifying neighborhoods,

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,040
which means there’s a lot
of young black and white voters.

75
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,280
— What do we want?!

76
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,280
— Health care!

77
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,680
— To win, Jabari believes he has
to capture those young white voters

78
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,280
and convince enough black residents
to leave the Democratic Party.

79
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,520
And he’s not sure if a white candidate could pull that off.

80
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,580
— The burden falls primarily, if not completely,

81
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,060
on socialist people of color.

82
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:18,219
It’s just not going to work
with a bunch of white socialists

83
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,180
coming in to a person of color communities
and telling them how things should operate,

84
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,840
because there is that color barrier, unfortunately.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,620
— A cynic would say that the best way for socialists
to try to overcome that in the next election

86
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,800
is to have people of color run as socialist.

87
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,260
Do you feel ever like you’re a token?

88
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,500
— I can see why that question would come up.

89
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,160
I would say no, most because
I’m doing this on my own volition,

90
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,600
because of things I strongly believe,

91
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,100
and I’m openly running and running as a socialist

92
00:04:50,100 --> 00:00:00,000
because I believe it is the best thing
for liberation of people of color.
