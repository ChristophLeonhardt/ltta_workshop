00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,580
the morning I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> slept for a few hours</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't know if that can even be counted</font>

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,880
because lots of people were<font color="#E5E5E5"> being really</font>

brilliant<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say a big part of the</font>

its construction use and strange power

31
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,520

something strangely empowering and gap

bridging about the imagined community I

39
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,740
didn't know still lots of agency for the

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,540
to some extent you have a choice about

<font color="#E5E5E5">community</font>

45

above it's not always a positive thing

today as well as being the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tale of the</font>

on days like this sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel like</font>

just not imagining at all in some ways

that's my response to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recent</font>

00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,240
creating and what other people are

creating and who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it as</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you isn't seeing it and how it's been</font>

received and how it's been spread and of

87
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,380
course we worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

88
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,320
we care about we do so much i like these

communities that we imagine ourselves

90
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,380
and then maybe that says some bad things

91
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,570
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> me it's just increasingly becoming</font>

92
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,120
more and more apparent how much agency

93
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,160
we have within the communities that we

94
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,140
create and we choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> to belong to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

95
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,240
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our lives is made up of being</font>

put into little boxes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hillside</font>

refuse to be made<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ticky-tacky imagine</font>

98
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,660
your own communities don't be afraid to

99
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,310
be childish about it and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be afraid</font>

100
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,110
to stop and start in to experiment and

to have fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> three things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i would</font>

present and it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of fun and it</font>

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,760
doesn't mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i support the monarchy</font>

112
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,350
and everything they do or the idea of

113

monarchy at all it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

114
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,590
chose to have fun with in the community

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was imagined for me and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine</font>

that a large part<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason why</font>

118
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,580
simultaneity and community has<font color="#CCCCCC"> become so</font>

119
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,620
important to me is because I'm abroad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

120
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,110
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that notion of being part of the</font>

121
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,760
community being member of certain

122

communities even<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you're not</font>

physically present or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other people</font>

in that community aren't physically

125
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,350
present like that becomes something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

126
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,420
you become even more aware of to

<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever extent you were aware of it</font>

before

129
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,420
it kind of has even great<font color="#E5E5E5"> significance</font>

130
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,920
in many ways it's one of the greatest

things I've done being ambassador and

132
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,020
it's being bought in america and just
