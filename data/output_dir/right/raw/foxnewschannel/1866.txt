1
00:00:00,486 --> 00:00:01,687
>> Julie: SHE WILL PRAISE HIM

2
00:00:01,687 --> 00:00:03,489
EVERY DAY FOR THE REST OF HER

3
00:00:03,489 --> 00:00:03,789
LIFE.

4
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:04,356
>> Bill: GOOD STORY.

5
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:07,927
>> Julie: SURE IS.

6
00:00:07,927 --> 00:00:11,096
>> WE FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE

7
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:11,931
OBVIOUS, THAT JERUSALEM IS

8
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:15,601
ISRAEL'S CAPITAL.

9
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:17,503
THIS IS NOTHING MORE OR LESS

10
00:00:17,503 --> 00:00:20,539
THAN A RECOGNITION OF REALITY.

11
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:21,674
>> Julie: PRESIDENT TRUMP SET TO

12
00:00:21,674 --> 00:00:22,508
FULFILL ANOTHER BIG CAMPAIGN

13
00:00:22,508 --> 00:00:23,275
PROMISE THERE.

14
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:25,744
MAKING GOOD ON A DECADES LONG

15
00:00:25,744 --> 00:00:28,514
PLEDGE WITH NEXT WEEK'S OPENING

16
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:30,883
OF THE NEW U.S. EMBASSY IN

17
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:31,250
JERUSALEM.

18
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,286
BUT THE RELOCATION IS CAUSING

19
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:35,054
QUITE A STIR.

20
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:36,088
DOUG JOINS US LIVE FROM

21
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:37,356
WASHINGTON THIS MORNING.

22
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:38,858
THIS WILL CAP OFF WHAT HAS

23
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:40,226
ARGUABLY BEEN ONE OF THE MOST

24
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:40,960
SUCCESSFUL WEEKS OF THE TRUMP

25
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,428
PRESIDENCY TO DATE.

26
00:00:42,428 --> 00:00:46,065
>> JULIE, CERTAINLY A CASE TO BE

27
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:47,766
MADE FOR THAT ESPECIALLY THOSE

28
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,268
WHO ARE NOT OBSESSED WITH STORMY

29
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:49,602
DANIELS.

30
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:50,970
THERE'S THE HOSTAGE RELEASE AND

31
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,872
THE UPCOMING MEETING WITH KIM

32
00:00:52,872 --> 00:00:54,673
JONG UN AND UNEMPLOYMENT AT A

33
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:56,342
TWO DECADE LOW.

34
00:00:56,342 --> 00:00:59,645
NOW COMES THE EMBASSY WEEK, A

35
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:01,547
WEEK AFTER TRUMP BACKED OUT OF

36
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:03,215
WHAT HE CALLED THE FLAWED IRAN

37
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:03,515
DEAL.

38
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:05,718
HE PORTRAYS THIS AS A SERIES OF

39
00:01:05,718 --> 00:01:06,085
VICTORIES.

40
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,454
>> NEXT WEEK AFTER THE PROMISES

41
00:01:08,454 --> 00:01:10,623
OF MANY ADMINISTRATIONS AND

42
00:01:10,623 --> 00:01:11,957
PRESIDENTS AND THEN THEY NEVER

43
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:12,825
DID IT.

44
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:14,560
THEY CAMPAIGNED, THEY PROMISED,

45
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,097
THEY NEVER DID IT!

46
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:22,201
NEXT WEEK, WE WILL FINALLY OPEN

47
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:22,835
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN

48
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:27,072
JERUSALEM!

49
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:28,474
>> THE STAKES ARE EXTREMELY

50
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:28,774
HIGH.

51
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:30,309
AND THE MOVE FRAUGHT WITH PERIL

52
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:32,244
WITH IRAN ALREADY BITTER OVER

53
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:34,346
THE U.S. PULLOUT OF THE JCPOA.

54
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:35,748
THE ROCKET ATTACKS FROM SYRIA ON

55
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:38,117
THE GOLAN HEIGHTS THIS WEEK AND

56
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:40,886
ISRAEL'S RETAILATION FOR THEM IS

57
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:43,389
A SIGN OF THE HAIR TRIGGER

58
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:44,456
CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW.

59
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:45,724
TO THAT POINT, SAUDI ARABIA HAS

60
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:47,092
ANNOUNCED THAT IF IRAN PROCEEDS

61
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:48,494
WITH ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS

62
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:50,362
DEVELOPMENT, SAUDI ARABIA WILL

63
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:53,065
EMBARK ON ITS OWN NUKE PROGRAM,

64
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:54,667
POTENTIAL NUCLEAR ESCALATION IN

65
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,168
THE WORLD'S HOTTEST SPOT.

66
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:56,535
JULIE?

67
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:57,903
>> Julie: AND THOSE ATTACKS

68
00:01:57,903 --> 00:01:59,371
RAISING QUESTIONS AS WELL, DOUG,

69
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:01,273
ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE U.S.

70
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:02,374
DELEGATION ATTENDING THE

71
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:02,975
EMBASSY'S OPENING.

72
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:04,877
IS THE PRESIDENT ATTENDING?

73
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:06,745
>> HE WILL NOT BE.

74
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:07,846
STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN

75
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:09,381
HEATHER NOWARD ANNOUNCED WHO

76
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:10,848
WILL BE GOING.

77
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:12,685
>> WE ARE PLEASED THAT OUR

78
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:14,119
DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN

79
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:18,991
SULLIVAN WILL BE LEADING THE

80
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:19,792
DELEGATION.

81
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,994
JARED AND IVANKA TRUMP ARE

82
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:22,962
JOINING THERE AS WELL.

83
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:24,163
WE'RE VERY PROUD AND PLEASED AT

84
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:25,130
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ACCOMPLISHMENT

85
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,764
IN DOING THIS.

86
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:27,099
IT'S SOMETHING HE PROMISED AND

87
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:27,733
NOW SOMETHING THAT HE IS

88
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:28,968
FULFILLING.

89
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:31,070
>> IN ADVANCE OF THE CEREMONY,

90
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,072
ISRAEL'S DEFENSE MINISTER IS

EL-ASSAD TO FORCE IRANIAN

93
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:38,544
SOLDIERS OUT OF SYRIA.

94
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:40,946
THEIR PRESENCE WILL ONLY CAUSE

95
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:41,914
"PROBLEMS AND DAMAGES".

96
00:02:41,914 --> 00:00:00,000
