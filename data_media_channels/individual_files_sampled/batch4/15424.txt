happy new year happy 2018 we are gonna dig deep into how the left and their mainstream media counterparts left 2017 as discredited as they entered it as we break down their reaction to the Iranian protests now these protests and Iran could be earth changing if there is regime change we might possibly have an ally in the region and an ally in a country that's one of the greatest state sponsors of terror and one of our greatest enemies see this is significant because the people in Iran are by and large secular they're pro-west they don't want to live under an Islamofascist regime controlled by mullahs any more than we do they want to be free they want to have the internet the women want to shop at Gucci and Louboutin the men want to go buy custom suits and drive Porsches and Ferraris these are highly educated people with the ability make a lot of money and they want to live well they're over it they're done now if you recall protests had sprung up during the Obama administration and he did nothing we now know he did nothing to preserve his disastrous Iran deal Obama leaving those protestors on the street was reminiscent of John Kennedy leaving the anti-castro fighters on the beach during the Bay of Pigs left them on the beach to be slaughtered and we've had Castro a communist enemy 90 miles off Key West ever since but let's look at some of the reactions from former Obama administration officials to the protests Susan Rice I'm gonna go through the tweets because these people have been very vocal on Twitter and then I'm gonna go through a timeline of just how abysmal CNN's coverage was a little bit later in the segment let's start with the Obama administration officials Susan Rice you remember Susan Rice the one went out there and sold us that Benghazi was over a YouTube video a woman who should be under investigation a woman who unmasked US persons alongside her friend Samantha power we're gonna get to Samantha power as well but let's see what Susan Rice said how can Trump help Iran's protesters question mark be quiet in reference to a New York Times op-ed of the same title be quiet these people need our help Susan Rice they need our support but no Susan Rice wants us to chat without channel her capitulating buddy obama the guy that never Chamberland bullied in high school no we're not gonna be quiet ambassador rice we're gonna help these Iranian protesters we're gonna support them we want democracy in the region unlike you and your boss Barry how about one of my favorites Samantha power former UN Ambassador pass us Cass Sunstein's wife far far left this ideological leftist we stand with the this is her Javits president Trump we stand with the Iranian people so much that we won't let them come here no we've cracked down an immigration through a global state sponsor of terror their government we and they have the same objective right now to get rid of the mullahs to get rid of the allama fascist hardliners we do not want these people in power the Iranian people do not want these people in power they don't want to live under Islamofascist maniacs who beat the women for not wearing hijabs they don't want to live that way Samantha power so stop with these snarky comments because you're another one who enabled the Iran deal now we're getting my two favorites Ben Rhodes remember Ben Rhodes one of Obama's national security advisors the Iranian people are rightfully demanding dignity less corruption more opportunity and greater control over their lives in looking at us Twitter it seems lost on too many that this is about what Iranians want for Iran and not about us really Ben when you and your boss Barack Obama and the other moron John Kerry were sending pallets of cash billions upon billions upon billions of US dollars to the mullahs when you were enabling their cooperation with North Korea on a nuke program did you care about dignity for the Iranian people less corruption for the Iranian people and more opportunity for the Iranian people did you care as you say about greater control over their own lives for the Iranian people no no you enriched the people who are oppressing them you lying hack and my favorite buffoon of the decade buffoon of the century a guy who doesn't even look like he can form a coherent sentence former Secretary of State John Kerry now this is my favorite let me read this to you his tweet John Kerry's tweet on the Iran protests with humility about how little we know about what's happening inside Iran this much is clear it's an Iranian moment and not anyone elses but the rights of people to protest peacefully and voice their aspirations are universal and governments everywhere should respect that now we're gonna break this down with the former Secretary of State this is the guy who alongside Obama sold us the Iran deal is a good thing this is the guy who alongside Obama approved dropping billions upon billions of US dollars pallets of cash on a runway in Tehran in the middle of the night tried to do it under our noses but we found out about it think about this with humility how little we know about what's happening inside Iran he's admitting we know nothing about what's happening inside Iran but he went ahead with the Iran deal and he gave them billions of US dollars anyway the guy's admitting they did it blindly although I don't think they did it blindly I think they did this they did this in a way that was very specific very targeted and very calculated they wanted the mullahs to stay in power they want globalism they want an enemy they need that to keep their globalist agenda going now a really disturbing story dropped from in The Times of Israel not disturbing because of the content the content is awesome but disturbing because it leaked and the stories title is Kuwaiti report report comes out of Kuwait to The Times of Israel u.s. gives I read US gives Israel go or go ahead to kill powerful Iranian general and they're talking about Qasem Soleimani the head of the Iranian guards the head of the Kurds force he's like a Goebbels a Lavrentiy Beria a Qaddafi all rolled into one think of the worst most brutal guys that ever ran fascist intelligence services and military units and in this case special operations unit all rolled into one really horrible guy who I love the fact that Israel wants to kill him I love the fact that if this report is true were given Israel the green light and support they need but what I don't like is that it leaked now disturbingly Isis this leak came from our side from the US not from Israel Israel has some pretty damn good operational security the Mossad doesn't really leak nor do their special operations unit within the units within the IDF it says to me that if this report is accurate that the leak came from some Obama holdovers in state maybe maybe CIA disturbingly maybe even Obama holdovers or globalist loyalists on our own National Security Council and if that's the case that is very very dangerous because soleimani is a really bad guy and he needs to go he simply needs to go now let's look at the news coverage of the Iran protests by what has turned out to be the most reprehensible fake news outlet on the planet now there's a lot of competition when you consider the New York Times while the Washington Post MSNBC but again our friends over at CNN take the cake but let's run down CNN's Twitter feed as these protests are unfolding they sounded at first like a propaganda outlet or soleimani and the mullahs okay on December 30th at 12:15 p.m. right around noon the day before New Year's Eve PNN tweets Iran's government warns against illegal gatherings after protests the story on the story on CNN story they used a photo first of all they called the protest that legal and pro-government they flat-out lied they had a correct it later on and the photo they used was from the Tasnim news agency which is the Iranian propaganda outlet controlled by the mullahs CNN took a news feed a photo feed from an Iranian government controlled news outlet CNN went on to tweet at 5:56 a.m. on New Year's Eve morning Iranian government issues stern warning that protesters will pay the price after anti-government demonstrations throughout the country turned deadly does that not sound like propaganda or the cuds force hey you protesters you better stand down or it's gonna get ugly for you CNN wasn't even trying to be objective now right after that first tweet I read you by seeing and they started getting be mmm up people were beating the hell out of them but CNN isn't gonna do a reversal right so they get a little bit tepid they start to pull back a little bit and make even bigger fools in themselves this was one of my favorite at 11:30 a.m. on New Year's Eve morning Eastern Time CNN tweeted Iran's protests are partly a reaction to a sputtering economy but there's something bigger at play really a sputtering economy no no no no no no because with CNN ignored what CNN left out was that image that has now gone globally viral of the woman ripping off her hijab and waving it around as she stood on a podium you see CNN doesn't want to admit what the protester really about oppressive Islamofascist rule and people having enough with it because it cuts into CNN's narrative that Islam is a religion of peace that Iran is in a state sponsor of terror and most importantly that the Iran deal be disastrous Iran deal that gave Iran nukes and allowed them to collaborate with North Korea on the new program that gave Iran billions upon billions of US taxpayer dollars and remember all those Obama administration officials tweeting about control over their lives the Iranian people control over their lives in peaceful protests will those billions upon billions that Obama John Kerry Ben Rhodes Susan Rice Samantha power approved to go over to Iran well how do you think the Iranian military is buying the weapons they're now using to oppress the protesters with the money the Obama administration gave them so yes CNN it is about something bigger it is about something much bigger than just the economy it's about freedom it's about liberty things you left this over at CNN apparently hate a little bit later that evening 10:46 p.m. on New Year's Eve Eastern Time enn I guess Captain Obvious join the editorial team at CNN here's why the Iran protests are significant Thank You Captain Obvious at CNN well then CNN had to do a total rehearsal and it pained them because they were getting beaten down so badly on Twitter for their biased coverage CNN issued a tweet at 319 p.m. yesterday New Year's Day well the biggest anti-government protests in Iran since 2009 have turned the spotlight on president Hassan rouhani's economic record no it's not about economics but at least they're admitting baby steps baby steps at least CNN is admitting that they are anti-government protests but that didn't last long that didn't last long because at 6:32 a.m. this morning CNN tweeted again Iran's supreme leader Iran's supreme leader blames enemies for sparking days of anti-government protests as the death toll rises to 21 now if you read CNN's tweet it is clearly worded to imply that enemies of the supreme leader are the ones responsible for the deadly aftermath of the protests not the oppressive Iranian government not the supreme leader and leader in the mullahs not assem Soleimani and the guards force and the Kurds force no no it's the protestors who are to blame it's the enemies of the supreme leader who were to blame you see CNN is in cahoots with the Obama administration they need to preserve the narrative they need to preserve the Iran deal and they need to keep up the charade that leftist actually know how to govern when in fact they are foreign policy disasters absolute disasters but when you piece these puzzles together we leave them nowhere to go that's why I love doing this kind of analysis free now the other thing about CNN that bothers me is why do they still have White House State Department and congressional press credentials seriously I am the biggest defender of the First Amendment but CNN can no longer build themselves as hard news they are left-wing biased opinion look here at the rebel we admit were a conservative media outlet but I can say this I can look in this camera and say this to you with the utmost confidence how editorial process is now far more stringent than CNN's it is I've got impeccable sources you see the people I bring on my show Sebastian Gorka it's got you linger a former CIA station chief you're gonna see a lot more of them as my show expands and there are days when I argue with my editor with the editors about using source material because it might be anonymous probably because my source is very sensitive and confidential even though they know who my source is they still don't want to run it because they want you the audience they have the utmost confidence that we're bringing you the truth but that isn't so for the New York Times for The Washington Post for CNN the New York Times will slander President Trump on one anonymous source The Washington Post will do it on one anonymous source in CNN CNN will publicly propagandize for the mullahs for the oppressors in Iran you're smarter now and it's long past time for better media outlets to be credentialed to be given those front-row seats in the White House press room to be given those first second and third questions because the mainstream media well they've done my job for me every day outlets like CNN big debunked themselves if you like this content I want to keep bringing it to you and I'm gonna be bringing it to you with a much longer show so please subscribe to our premium
