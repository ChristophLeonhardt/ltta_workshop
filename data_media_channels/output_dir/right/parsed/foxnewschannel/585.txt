SIGN THAT HE COULD POTENTIALLY
BE A SUBJECT OR A TARGET OF THIS
INVESTIGATION.
ED?
>> Ed: KRISTIN FISHER, I
APPRECIATE THEIR REPORTING.
AS  AS A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST R
AS  AS A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST G
AS  AS A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST R
STONE NEXT ON THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL WAS?
STONE JOINS US NOW LIVE TO TELL
US WHAT HE KNOWS AND WHAT HE
DOESN'T.
GOOD EVENING, MR. STONE.
>> THANK YOU, ED.
GREAT TO BE HERE.
>> Ed: WE HEARD THAT CLIP FROM
SHE GOT IN TROUBLE, SO SHE HAS
REFORMED HER LIFE, AND YOU'VE
HIRED HER TO DO WORK.
SHE IS TRYING TO TURN THINGS
AROUND AND SHE BASICALLY SAYS,
SOMEHOW, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WHO
IS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AT
ALLEGED RUSSIAN COLLUSION
BROUGHT HER IN FOR QUESTIONING.
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?
>> THEY STRUCK HER WITH A BILL
TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON.
OR ANYTHING ELSE.
NOR DOES ANYBODY ELSE WHO HAS
BEEN PARADED IN FRONT OF THE
GRAND JURY.
THERE IS NO SUCH WITNESS WHO CAN
I REALLY DO REGARD THOSE AS THE
PRESIDENT SAYS, AS A WITCH HUNTS
PRESIDENT SAYS, AS A WITCH HUNT.
THAT WAS A GREAT REPORT FROM A
REPORTER BUT IT WAS ALL
SPECULATION.
YES, I HAD AN INNOCUOUS 24 WORD
EXCHANGE WITH HIM ON WIKILEAKS
>> Ed: YOU ARE SAYING THERE'D
BE NO CRIME TO ANY ALLEGED --
ANY TALKING TO GUCCIFER,
WIKILEAKS, WHAT YOU ARE
MAINTAINING TONIGHT.
PARTNERS IN A FIRM IN WASHINGTON
MANY YEARS AGO, IT WASN'T
RECENT, BUT BOTTOM LINE,
PAUL MANAFORT, DOESN'T APPEAR,
DO WITH A 2016 ELECTION.
A RUNAWAY FEDERAL PROSECUTOR
COULD CONJURE UP SOME OFFENSE ON
MY PART IN AN EFFORT TO PRESSURE
ME TO TESTIFY AGAINST THE
AND ARTICULATE CRITIC OF THE
OTHER MISDEED HAVING TO DO THE
2016 ELECTION, NO.
KRISTIN DAVIS SAID THIS MORNING
ON FOX THAT WHEN SHE TRIED TO
EXPLAIN, THEY CUT HER OFF.
YOU GIVE AN ANSWER THEY DON'T
LIE, THEY CUT YOU OFF.
NO, I THINK IF THEY BRING A CASE
AGAINST ME, IT WILL BE A
FABRICATED CASE, AND THERE IS NO
CIRCUMSTANCES WHATSOEVER, ED, IN
WHICH I WILL TESTIFY.
>> Ed: REAL QUICK, WE ARE JUST
TALKING ABOUT OMAROSA, SHE WAS
ON MSNBC EARLIER TODAY AND
INVOKED YOU.
LISTEN TO THIS.
>> I THINK THAT ROGER STONE
SHADY CHARACTERS IN TRUMP WORLD
FOR A VERY LONG TIME, AND I
THINK THAT THEY HAVE THEIR SITE
SHADY CHARACTER.
DOES OMAROSA KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU THAT WE DON'T AND YOU
KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT THAT YOU MIGHT TELL
ROBERT MUELLER?
>> A, LOOK IN THE MIRROR,
OMAROSA.
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO CONVINCED
THE PRESIDENT TO SEND A
DELEGATION TO HAITI FOR THE
INAUGURATION OF THE CORRUPT
NOW WITH DIFFERENT FRONT FUN.
YOU THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT WAS
GREAT UNTIL YOU GOT FIRED AND
NOW YOU SAY HE IS A RACIST.
NEGATIVE TOWARD THE PRESIDENT.
AND I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY
UP IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF A
TIGHT SPOT, SOME FALSE
ALLEGATION IS BROUGHT AGAINST
HIM.
>> Ed: 15 SECONDS.
WHAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE HERE?
IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT
PAUL MANAFORT, WHO HAS BEEN
SQUEEZED FOR A MONTH ON MONTH,
FACING A LONG TIME POTENTIALLY
IN JAIL, OR YOU, HAVE
ANYTHING ON THE PRESIDENT.
>> I THINK BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN A
VERY EFFECTIVE ADVOCATE ON
BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE
I'M THE CONSERVATIVES AND
LIBERALS LOVE TO HATE.
ED, THERE IS NO RUSSIAN
