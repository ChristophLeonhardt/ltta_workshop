[bomb blasts]

2
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:21,310
“Thousands of civilians

3
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,780
have fled parts of
Syria’s Daraa Province,

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,880
where the government
has stepped up its offensive.”

5
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:38,690
“Russian and regime forces
target hospitals

6
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,447
cynically and deliberately.”

7
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:43,805
“The country’s entire health
system has collapsed.”

8
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:47,030
“Some of those fleeing the
violence have nowhere to go,

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,340
and the Jordan-Syria
border remains closed.”

10
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,554
“Oh, oh, no, no no.”

11
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:35,335
“I’m sorry.

12
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:36,805
I’m sorry.”

13
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,870
“So Dr. Mohammed, do you
see the colon up here?

14
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,030
It’s plastered
onto the bowel.”

15
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:16,460
“No, this is bad —

16
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,890
this is a lot of
inflammation.”

17
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,690
“Hmm.”

18
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:30,664
“It’s really not
looking good at all.”
