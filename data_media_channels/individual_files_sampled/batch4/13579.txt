hundreds of thousands of women marched in protest yesterday upset because actually I don't know why they're upset you know they're women they're always getting upset about something but not all women were welcome at the I'm a woman so I get upset a lot March you see about half of women say their baby growing inside their bodies is a precious individual life with the same right to exist as any of the rest of us the other half of women say now babies annoy me let's kill it well it turns out that killed a baby crowd feel that the good people are not real women and can't join the March now you may say whoa wait a minute how can someone say that a woman is not a woman if she's a woman what is there some sort of identity Council that decides your identity for you yes there is the identity council is an august body of leftists hysterics and buffoons but i repeat myself that meets in secret once a month to determine what everyone's identity is only the identity council can decide if someone has the right to be a woman or black or gay this is an important job because women blacks and gays are victims and being a victim is the very best identity you can have because victims can tell everyone else what to do and think and can legally steal other people's money now in order to become a victim you can't just be you know a victim you have to believe what victims are supposed to believe let's say for instance you're a white female gazillionaire pop singer Wow aren't you lucky not at all if you believe in abortion then according to the identity council you're a woman and therefore a victim and can now make speeches about how hard your gazillionaire life is conversely if you're a black female waitress who's just scraping by and you don't believe in abortion then you're a white male and your money can be taken away to pay for the abortions of gazillionaire white pop singers likewise if you're a black descendants of American slaves who works your way out of poverty to become a Supreme Court judge but you're a conservative sorry according to the identity Council you're a white man and can't be included in a museum dedicated to African American achievement if you're a man who has sex with other men but support Donald Trump you're not gay but if you're a man and you put on a dress and vote Democratic you're a woman and can begin making demands on other people's wallets and belief systems now you may say wait an identity council like that isn't really about identity it's just about using imaginary victim status to consolidate power so that a small number of privileged people can impose their values on the rest of us if you say that then you're a sane rational honest adult living in a fact-based universe or as the identity Council would say a white male sorry trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show ah what a weekend we have oscar-winning cultural correspondent Michael Knowles and feminist icon Michael Knowles I should add

is me and mark Stein watching the inaugural together just chatting about what was happening I was so happy to see Obama's chopper take off that was so good at this point Obama is gonna be gone forever now we can't play the happiness montage every day it's just too long many people felt slightly differently about this whole thing and about Trump taking office I just have to play before before we get into talking about what actually has happened over the weekend I have to play the here's the media reaction here's Joe Scarborough talking about what happened in one of the biggest news rooms in the country there was somebody that held an extraordinarily important position in American media in print media who brought their people together after Hillary Clinton lost and literally said we did the best we could do we tried and we failed but we did the best we can do and there were people crying in this newsroom I'm not gonna say which newsroom it is it was a very big newsroom I said we did the three papers you're damn straight I am all right you're down to three papers actually he's down to two papers because of the three papers they're talking about the New York Times a former newspaper in the Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal and we know it wasn't The Wall Street Journal right they can live with Trump so if we were talking the new york times of the washing boats we tried we tried to stop him but we failed boohoo boohoo and if you wanted to see a little bit he wanted to see the version the showbiz version of that all you had to do was turn on Saturday Night Live were Cecily strong unbelievably sang a goodbye to Barack Obama from an old Sidney Poitier movie already kind of weirdly racist and think what this is to serve with let me just tell you it would love Sidney pottier plays so this is a genre of film he plays the teacher who goes into the tough British neighborhood and tames the kids and teaches them and they're also grateful to him that they sing this comes the theme song she's singing it to Barack Obama listen to this in my mind but how do you thank someone who has taken you easy but I'll try little pitchy darling a little pitchy but we'll move you on to the next round what the hell are these people talking I was so disgusting the President Lee took us thank you for taking this from crayons to perfume I mean that's not creepy yes and then and then to Sir with unbelievable these guys are fit for fascism they are cut out for the fascist mold and it was it's just I was just so delighted to see that dude take off and my feeling is fairly well my friend have a great retirement so then Donald Trump stands out and he makes this speech and everybody's been analyzing this speech to death and I I'm gonna analyze it a little less in some ways because a lot of it you know it's very hard to know what Trump is going to do and a lot of what we want what I feel is going to be important about the Trump administration is not all the noise so then that will have its importance but it's going to be what he does but let's take a look I had mixed feelings about the speech I mean look we can't we're not gonna be sane we are not gonna be saying if everything the Trump does is great we're just not gonna talk that way because we know he's volatile we know he can be undependable we know he doesn't have you know he doesn't quite have a philosophy shaped yet so let's let's call him as we see him so we at least of this little island are not going crazy with everybody else so he starts off the speech with a line like I almost when I say I could have written it myself I actually suggested a line just like this to the Ted Cruz campaign when Cruz was still running let's hear that opening thing where he talks about giving power back to the people today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you the people for too long a small group in our nation's capitol has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed the establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country their victories have not been your victories their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation's capital there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land so I I love this I mean this is not only speaking the hearts of the people who elected him it's also speaking the intentions of the founders this is what the supposed to be government of the people by the people and for the people and that's what it has not been a man who rules with a pen and a phone a guy who passes executive orders who doesn't care if the other party you know defies him every step of the way he's just gonna do it himself that is not government by the people a guy who rules by regulation which Obama has done it's a very underreported story but the regulations in this country have exploded and that means every little thing you do you can pass some unelected bureaucrat can come and take out this is great stuff my love to press the press always finds one word they have a talking point they all use it so everybody's dark it was a dark speech what I love about this is that the left can come out and say if we don't stop driving cars the world will be destroyed that's not dark that's not dark because everybody knows it's not true in the same way that boo and Barack Obama says he opposed gay marriage they never hold that against him because everybody knew it wasn't true the problem is when Trump talks he kind of means some of this stuff and like they think like oh well we wait we gonna be blamed for what we did to this country that's not good then he goes on and he goes into something I guess we can call some kind of neo isolationism talking about the fact that we're no longer going to try to impose our way of life on the world we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example we will shine for everyone to follow and by the way this is what conservatism used to look like this is what conservative mused like we don't want to impose our will we're not imperialist we will just shine and everyone will become like us because they'll see how great it is you know President Reagan used to say that he wished he could take the premier of Russia and put him in a plane and just fly him over what a normal middle-class suburb looks like in America because to a Soviet it would have looked like heaven on earth it was incredible you know all our our socialist folk singers like Pete Seeger we're going oh it's Ricky ticky tacky you know this Levittown people in this world would kill to live in Levittown to have a house and a lawn and your kids going to safe school I mean that's what that stuff was beautiful stuff but not to the left it was always conformist it was a soul-killing it was destructive better to live in a you know a Dasha you know in a little soviet apartment huddling without you know without heat so so this stuff this is a change this is a change from certainly from george w bush's freedom agenda spreading freedom around the world it's even a change from the kind of post-war idea that right now we are the leaders of the world and we are going to transform everybody into us again how much of a change is going to depend on the policies and since we don't know those yet i suspect it's you know he's meeting with Theresa May this week he's talked about restoring our ties to Israel I feel like it's probably gonna look a little bit more like Reagan than it does like you know that George W Bush so on I was not too concerned that we're gonna get seriously isolationist in a world where if you become isolationist very quickly the bad guys are at your door I mean that was the lesson of World War two you can't stay isolationist forever because the bad ones if there's a knock at the door and you open it up and it's Hitler you know it's not a great idea so finally there was this this this trade stuff which has bothered me about Trump from the very beginning it continues to bother me here he is on trade every decision on trade on taxes on immigration on foreign affairs will be made to benefit America workers and American families we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products stealing our companies and destroying our jobs protection will lead to great prosperity and strength I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down two things about this and then we're gonna have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but before I do just two things about this one is protectionism never works it just has never worked the only thing about that is I'll say in Trump's favor a sees a practical guy he's not an ideologue if he does protectionist things like Nixon didn't it doesn't work he'll probably change it you know it's it's it's the wrong way to go but who again who knows what his policies are gonna be we're not sure yet today he's supposedly renegotiating or starting renegotiations on NAFTA which is probably a very good idea and he is allowed to do that because it's not a treaty per se a treaty would have to be voted on by Congress but it doesn't have to be an renegotiated you know this thing about this thing about the way he treats other people you know I'm gonna have to say goodbye first to Facebook and YouTube and come on over to the Daily wire calm and I'll finish my sentence and you can hear it there
