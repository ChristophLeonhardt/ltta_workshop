- This is why the left is
shocked when they lose elections.
They're shocked, they
turn hysterical when they
lose elections 'cause
they were supposed to win.
Don't you know, didn't you get the memo?
In 2000, Al Gore was supposed to win.
He was supposed to be the President.
In 2016, don't get me started on 2016.
Oh, in 2016, she was supposed to win.
All the political scientists
told us she was going to win.
What's the matter?
And so when she didn't
win, and she didn't win,
and when she didn't win, that
deserves a round of applause.
(audience applauding)
So when Hillary didn't win,
(audience applauding and cheering)
You and I, we could be
here all night doing that.
All right, do it again.
(crowd cheering and applauding)
So when Hillary didn't
win, she, all right, stop.
(laughter)
When she didn't win, she lost it.
She lost it.
It couldn't possibly be,
because she didn't win.
It couldn't be.
Do you know who's fault it was?
It was the Macedonians.
It was the Russians.
It was Comey, it was that, it was Tr.
Really, Donald Trump was
the guy who beat her.
The only answer that
she could not land on,
the only one that the
ideological Democrats
could not accept was
that the American people,
those deplorable
irredeemable American people
did not vote for her.
That she lost fair and square.
