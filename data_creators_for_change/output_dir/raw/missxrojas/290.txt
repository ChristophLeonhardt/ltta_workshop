35
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,949
I often do after these sorts of events

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">really like creatively invigorated and</font>

37

really entrepreneurial I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

many<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources there are four people out</font>

42
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,280
there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the while trying to make</font>

43
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,720
things I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to pretend that</font>

44
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,979
it's not rubbish that the government

45
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,479
keeps cutting back art funding and

46
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,640
funding things like museums but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

47
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,200
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone with an idea there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,850
people there to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you've just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

49
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a little bit of digging and</font>

50
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,610
everyone I met<font color="#CCCCCC"> today for the record</font>

51
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,229
really recommended school for startups

52
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,670
as well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think when you have an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

53
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,740
it's so easy to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh it's because</font>

54
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,270
I need funding that's why I'm not making

55
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,740
it happen I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of it is about</font>

56
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,900
structuring your plan understanding your

57
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,210
market understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> your consumer in</font>

58
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,680
general like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the psychology of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

59
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,780
consumer understanding what it is you

60
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,040
want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so much</font>

61
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,470
understanding has to go into making

62
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,689
something and sharing something whether

63
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's something physical or whether</font>

64
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,750
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service but the main number</font>

65
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,729
one takeaway ahead from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> event was</font>

66
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,130
oh my<font color="#CCCCCC"> gosh these women there were many</font>

67
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,930

Tom he made this amazing table

69
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,080
but overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt like it was the women</font>

70
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">who had the most understanding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

their<font color="#CCCCCC"> products who had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

72
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,580
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the economy at the</font>

73
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,350
moment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the opportunities that</font>

74
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,540
the recession and austerity mindset

75
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,700
poses things like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to buy</font>

76
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,890
high-quality products will last them a

77
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and also something that they</font>

78
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,740
can pass on something with that

79
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,750
sentimentality that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our lot the things</font>

81
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,320
like the women<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the most optimism and</font>

82
