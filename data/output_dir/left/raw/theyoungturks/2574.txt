1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,120
>>DONALD TRUMP WANTS A VARIETY
OF MILITARY OPTIONS FOR NORTH

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,570
KOREA, IT'S NOT BEING TALKED
ABOUT MUCH BUT HE HAS ASKED THE

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,450
PENTAGON TO SUPPLY THOSE
OPTIONS, AND NOW A LEAK OUT OF

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,090
THE PENTAGON HAS SAID THEY DON'T
WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,279
AFRAID THAT IF THEY PROVIDE
OPTIONS HE IS GOING TO CHOOSE

6
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,869
ONE, AND THAT IS CAUSING A COLD
SWEAT TO ROLL DOWN THE NECK OF

7
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:31,429
SOME OF OUR MOST EXPERIENCED
GENERALS.

8
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:32,429
AND THERE'S A REASON

9
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,360
FOR THIS, BECAUSE THERE IS SORT
OF A RIFT BETWEEN DIFFERENT

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,800
PORTIONS OF THE WHITE HOUSE ON
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
NORTH KOREA --

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:53,840
>>WHICH SOUNDS TO ME LIKE ALL
OUT WAR, BUT THEY ARE PITCHING

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,469
IT AS JUST GETTING RID OF THE
ARSENAL.

14
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:56,469
NOW --

15
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:04,290
>>AND IF YOU FOLLOW HIS TWITTER
THAT'S A CONCERN, THAT HE MIGHT

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,540
DO SOMETHING WHEN IT COMES TO
NORTH KOREA.

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,550
SO MCMASTER

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,660
REPRESENTS THE HAWKISH PART OF
THE WHITE HOUSE, SUPPOSEDLY

19
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:25,260
THERE IS A PART THAT ONCE MORE
CAUTION WHEN IT COMES TO

20
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,260
NORTH KOREA --

21
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,760
>>WHICH SOUNDS GOOD, BUT THEN
YOU FIND OUT THAT --

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:35,300
>>YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE
COOLER HEADS, BUT YOU ARE THE

23
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:42,260
ONES CALLING FOR THE STRIKE.

24
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,540
WHO
DO YOU THINK, JARED IS GOING TO

25
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,540
STAND AGAINST IT.

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,540
ASK BARRON.

27
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,700
>>THERE IS SO MUCH REVERSE
PSYCHOLOGY.

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,870
WE NEED TO LAY OUT

29
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,250
HOW WE WANT THE BABY TO PLAY
WITH SOMETHING BUT NOT MY KEYS

30
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,880
OR MY CELL PHONE, SO JUST PUT
OTHER THINGS IN HERE.

31
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
DO WE GIVE

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,370
THE BABY THREE OPTIONS OR FIVE
OPTIONS, OR JUST THE TOY?

33
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,370
IT'S VERY UNCLEAR.

34
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,920
>>THERE IS A LOT OF THIS IN THE
CHAIN OF GOVERNMENT, WHERE THEY

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,710
KICK IT UP AND THEY THINK
SO-AND-SO -- THERE'S A FAMOUS

36
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,170
CASE IN THE ARMY WHERE THERE WAS
A DESERTER WHO WAS EXECUTED AND

37
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,670
THE JUDGE WHO PRESIDED OVER HIS
FIRST COURT-MARTIAL/EXECUTION

38
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,850
TRIAL SAID I VOTED FOR EXECUTION
BUT I THOUGHT WHEN HE APPEALED

39
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,150
IT WOULD BE OVERTURNED, I DIDN'T
THINK THEY WOULD ACTUALLY

40
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,680
EXECUTE HIM. AND THEY SHOT HIM,
FIRING SQUAD.

41
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,230
SAME THING HERE,

42
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,670
YOU ARE THE COOLER HEADS, AND
THERE IS NO LIMITED NUCLEAR OR

43
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,091
OTHER EVEN CONVENTIONAL MILITARY
STRIKE ON NORTH KOREA, CAN'T BE

44
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:44,091
DONE.

45
00:02:44,091 --> 00:02:47,950
IT WILL IMMEDIATELY BRING
ABOUT REPRISALS, AND A

46
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,960
CONFLAGRATION OF THE SORT THAT I
THINK COULD KILL MILLIONS.

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
IT'S

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,510
EXTRAORDINARY TO ME, IT'S A
STANDOFF THAT COULD LEFT ALONE

49
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,100
JUST SIT FOR FOUR YEARS.

50
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,430
I DON'T
THINK TRUMP HAS TO ACT ON THIS,

51
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,210
THERE IS NO IMPERATIVE APART
FROM THE FACT THAT TRUMP FEELS

52
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,350
INSULTED BY THIS GUY WHO INSULTS
EVERYBODY.

53
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,350
BUT TRUMP MAKES HIM

54
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,020
LOOK POLITE.

55
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,750
SO APART FROM EGO AND MACHISMO I
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS

56
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,770
GOING ON IN THAT WHITE HOUSE.

57
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,800
>>WHAT ELSE IS THERE WHEN IT
COMES TO U.S. FOREIGN POLICY?

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,200
EGO AND MACHISMO PRETTY MUCH
COVERS IT.

59
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,260
>>IF YOU GO BACK FAR ENOUGH
THERE HAS BEEN SOME FOREIGN

60
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,630
AID THAT WAS HELPFUL,
RECONSTRUCTING AFTER THE WAR.

61
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,760
>>THERE WAS?

62
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,890
>>ONE THING WE DO FROM A
DIPLOMATIC STANDPOINT IS BE

63
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:38,360
CO-OPTED GOVERNMENTS, FIRST WE
GO IN WITH MONEY, YOU ARE GOING

64
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,160
TO HAVE OUR CORPORATIONS, U.S.
CORPORATIONS GO IN, AND WE WILL

65
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,330
TAKE OVER YOUR COUNTRY
ECONOMICALLY.

66
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,330
AND OF COURSE IF

67
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,750
YOU DON'T DO THAT THAT'S WHEN WE
ASSASSINATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND

68
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,750
BRING IN OUR OWN GUY.

69
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,830
BUT NONE OF THAT HERE, THIS IS
ALL ABOUT STUFF THAT GOES BANG.

70
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,720
>>IT'S A GOOD COP/COUP COP.

71
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,490
>>WHERE IS DENNIS RODMAN?

72
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,160
HE
CAN SOLVE THIS WHOLE THING.

73
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
IT

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,010
IS REALLY SAD TO SEE THAT OUR
TOP MILITARY LEADERS ARE EVEN

75
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,459
THINKING ABOUT PUTTING DIFFERENT
VARIATIONS OF APOCALYPSE IN

76
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,029
FRONT OF THIS CHILD, WHEN IT'S
SO CLEAR WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

77
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,559
IN NORTH KOREA AND HOW TO EASE
TENSIONS.

78
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,780
STOP HAVING REGULAR

79
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,780
WARGAMES.

80
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,020
THE UNITED STATES
NEEDS TO STOP SIMULATING AN

81
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,220
ATTACK ON NORTH KOREA.

82
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
SIMPLE.

83
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,410
THAT WOULD APPEASE SO MANY

84
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,410
PEOPLE.

85
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,280
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE
BASICALLY PRETENDING LIKE WE ARE

86
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,810
ALREADY ATTACKING NORTH KOREA.

87
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,870
IMAGINE IF NORTH KOREA PRETENDED

88
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,210
TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES
EVERY YEAR FOR SHITS AND

89
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,210
GIGGLES.

90
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,410
>>TO HER POINT,
THAT'S ALL THEY WANT.

91
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,660
JUST STOP YOUR WARGAMES AND WE
WILL STOP OUR NUCLEAR

92
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,660
DEVELOPMENT.

93
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,070
>>AND LOOK HOW WE FREAK OUT WHEN
THEY TEST MISSILES.

94
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,020
>>THAT IS LOST IN THIS RHETORIC,
THEY HAVEN'T ASKED FOR

95
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,500
ANYTHING THAT WE COULDN'T
PROVIDE.

96
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,420
WE COULD STOP THE WARGAMES AND
THIS WHOLE THING STOPS.

97
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,400
>>I TRY TO REMIND PEOPLE AS MUCH
AS POSSIBLE, IT'S IMPORTANT

98
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,770
TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE WERE
TO DO SOME SORT OF STRIKE

99
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,020
AGAINST NORTH KOREA, EVEN IF
WE WERE TO DESTROY THEIR

100
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,550
ENTIRE NUCLEAR ARSENAL, THAT IS
LARGELY IRRELEVANT BECAUSE

101
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,790
IF THEY STRIKE BACK, WHETHER
AGAINST US, PROBABLY NOT,

102
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,199
JAPAN, LOWER CHANCE, BUT
DEFINITELY SOUTH KOREA,

103
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,980
THEY DON'T NEED NUCLEAR WEAPONS
TO KILL TENS OR HUNDREDS OF

104
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,370
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN
JUST A FEW DAYS.

105
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,210
THEY CAN DO THAT WITH THEIR
CONVENTIONAL ARTILLERY THAT

106
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,380
IS DUG INTO THE MOUNTAINSIDE
AND WOULD BE VIRTUALLY

107
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,110
IMPOSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE BEING
ABLE TO DESTROY EVEN IN A

108
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,020
WELL-PLANNED FIRST STRIKE.

109
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,110
THAT IS THE NO NUCLEAR OPTION
CONSEQUENCE, HUNDREDS OF

110
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,420
THOUSANDS OF DEAD PEOPLE.

111
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,000
NUCLEAR JUST AMPSIT UP.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,570
>>KIM JONG-UN, WHAT DOES HE
WANT?

113
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,590
OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE, A

114
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,000
STRIKE MIGHT BE LIKE, THANK GOD,
GET US OUT OF THIS NIGHTMARE.

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,580
YOU SEE THAT SATELLITE IMAGERY
OF NORTH KOREA, THE ENTIRE

116
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,389
COUNTRY IS LIVING IN SQUALOR.

117
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,050
OBVIOUSLY OUR COUNTRY HAS NO

118
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,680
INTENTION OF LIBERATING THE
NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE, WE DON'T

119
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,410
GIVE A SHIT, BUT KIM, WHAT DOES
HE WANT?

120
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,669
>>KIM WANTS TO STAY IN POWER,
THAT'S ALL HE CARES ABOUT.

121
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:20,669
HE

122
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,410
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT HIS PEOPLE,
WE KNOW THAT, AND AS FRANCESCA

123
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,650
SAID IT'S DEMONSTRABLY THE CASE
ACROSS NORTH KOREA THAT THE

124
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,960
PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING.

125
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,300
HE WANTS TO
STAY IN POWER.

126
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,610
THAT'S THE

127
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,290
INSURANCE POLICY AGAINST THERE
BEING ANY CONFLICT.

128
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,290
HE DOESN'T

129
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:41,400
WANT CONFLICT WITH THE U.S., SO
IT'S NOT A PART OF THE WORLD YOU

130
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,830
HAVE TO CONCERN YOURSELF WITH
APART FROM RHETORIC, AND THAT'S

131
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,860
WHAT EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON
KNOWS EXCEPT FOR DONALD TRUMP.

132
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,010
AS TO THE ONE THING YOU SAID,
THOSE POOR NORTH KOREANS, WHO AS

133
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:57,120
YOU SAY HAVE NOTHING, REMIND ME
OF SO MANY OF THE IRAQIS.

134
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
WE

135
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,120
TALKED ABOUT IRAQ, THOSE PEOPLE
HAVE IT AWFUL UNDER SADDAM

136
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,350
HUSSEIN, THEY WILL WELCOME
AMERICAN TROOPS, NO.

137
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,350
ONCE THE

138
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,740
BOMBS START FALLING EVERYBODY IS
A PATRIOT TO THE COUNTRY THAT

139
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,590
THEY ARE LIVING IN.

140
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,681
THE NORTH
KOREANS WOULD DIG IN.

141
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:16,979
>>THERE IS NO RIGHT WAY TO
WELCOME A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST.

142
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,210
>>NO ONE IS SAYING THANK YOU FOR
ENDING THIS.

143
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,850
>>JUST TO UPDATE US, SOME OF
THAT STUFF WAS FROM PREVIOUSLY,

144
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,890
BUT DONALD TRUMP AT THE STATE OF
THE UNION SAID THIS --

145
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:41,040
>>THERE IS A LOT TO CRITICIZE
AND HOW VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS

146
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,430
OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS HAVE
DEALT WITH NORTH KOREA, BUT HERE

147
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,169
IS WHAT THEY DIDN'T LEAD TO --
NUCLEAR WAR. AND THEY DID PUT

148
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:51,660
OFF THEM HAVING NUCLEAR WEAPONS
FOR A LONG TIME.

149
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,660
SO YES THERE

150
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,070
WERE MISTAKES, BUT NOT
APOCALYPTIC MISTAKES.

151
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,110
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.

152
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,120
>>ALSO, ALL TRUMP LIVES FOR AND
REPRESENTS IS AGGRESSION AND

153
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
PROVOCATION.

154
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,509
THIS IS AN
AGGRESSION AND PROVOCATION

155
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:06,509
PRESIDENT.

156
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:10,190
HE'S LIKE, IF THERE
WILL BE ANY AGGRESSION AND

157
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,240
PROVOCATION IT'S COMING FROM ME.

158
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,460
FOLDED ARMS.

159
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,280
>>THAT'S A GREAT POINT, HE IS
AGGRESSION AND PROVOCATION,

160
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,320
THAT'S FAIR.

161
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,020
BY THE WAY, THE WAY
WE KEPT THIS ENTIRE SITUATION

162
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,889
WITH NORTH KOREA KIND OF COOL
FOR ALL THIS TIME IF YOU WANT TO

163
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,160
CALL IT THAT, THE WAY WE HANDLED
THE SITUATION WAS WITH MONEY.

164
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,120
IT'S THE U.S. WAY.

165
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,099
WE BOUGHT KIM
OUT. AND SANCTIONS AS WELL.

166
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:36,759
THEY HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN
INEFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF

167
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,589
COMPLETELY STOPPING HIS NUCLEAR
DEVELOPMENT BUT THAT HAS

168
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:40,589
BEEN THE COURSE.

169
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:45,160
>>DO YOU MEAN AID, OFFERING THEM
SOME AMOUNT OF AID?

170
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,649
>>WE DRENCHED HIS DAD IN MONEY
TO KIND OF CHILL HIM OUT.

171
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,240
NOW IT'S ABOUT SANCTIONS, WE'VE
SEEN THAT THOSE SANCTIONS

172
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN EFFECTIVE.

173
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,600
>>BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TO SOME
EXTENT CONTRAVENED BY OTHER

174
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,959
COUNTRIES GETTING IN THERE.

175
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,410
>>HE MAKES BACKDOOR DEALS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES.

176
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,509
>>THIS WILL HAVE TO BE OUR LAST
THOUGHT ON THIS.

177
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:09,139
>>THERE IS A NUCLEAR FOOTBALL,
IT'S NOT AN ACTUAL FOOTBALL,

178
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:15,589
SUPER BOWL SUNDAY, IT'S GOING TO
BE A FOOTBALL TOMORROW, AND IT

179
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,679
FOLLOWS HIM AROUND.

180
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:19,430
AND FOR
PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T AROUND OR

181
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:26,100
DON'T REMEMBER THE SECOND WORLD
WAR, IT IS VERY REAL.

182
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,100
ANYWAY,

183
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,850
JUST PUT THAT IN YOUR PIPE AND
SMOKE IT.

184
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,269
>>IT'S DESIGNED FOR HIM TO BE
ABLE TO ACT QUICKLY BECAUSE THAT

185
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:34,010
WAS SET UP FOR HIM TO ACT IN
RESPONSE TO WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO

186
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,660
BE A SOVIET THREAT.

187
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,869
THAT IS WHY
HE AND HE ALONE CAN LAUNCH

188
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:41,800
WITHOUT ANY APPROVAL WHATSOEVER.

189
00:09:41,800 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT IT'S A HORRIFYING SCENARIO.
