>> Martha: HOMELESSNESS IN

2
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:12,884
SEATTLE IS A BIG PROBLEM, BUT

3
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:14,085
AMAZON CRIED UNCLE WHEN THEY

4
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:17,088
WERE ASKED TO FOOT THE BILL.

5
00:00:17,088 --> 00:00:18,456
WEEKS AFTER THE CITY PASSED WHAT

6
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:20,225
IS CALLED A HEAD TAX, THE

7
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:22,427
CITY COUNCIL NOW SAYING

8
00:00:22,427 --> 00:00:23,028
NEVER MIND AFTER AMAZON

9
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:25,063
THREATENED TO LEAVE THE CITY.

10
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:26,097
THE BILL WOULD HAVE FORCED

11
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:27,766
BUSINESSES THAT PULL IN OVER

12
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:30,902
$20 MILLION TO PAY $275 PER

13
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:31,269
EMPLOYEE.

14
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:33,071
FOR AMAZON, THE CITY'S LARGEST

15
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:34,639
EMPLOYER, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

16
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:36,141
MORE THAN $12 MILLION A YEAR,

17
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:38,443
BUT SMALLER BUSINESSES WITH

18
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:39,177
TIGHTER MARGINS WOULD HAVE FELT

19
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:41,246
EVEN MORE.

20
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:42,948
BILL BENNETT THE HOST OF THE

21
00:00:42,948 --> 00:00:44,282
BILL BENNETT PODCAST AND A

00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:45,684
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND STEVE

HILTON, HOST OF THE NEXT

24
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:48,053
REVOLUTION HERE ON FNC.

25
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:49,354
BILL, YOU TAKE THE FIRST CRACK

26
00:00:49,354 --> 00:00:54,492
ON THIS, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

27
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:56,294
>> THIS IS A KIND OF A LIBERAL

28
00:00:56,294 --> 00:01:00,432
SHOCK OF RECOGNITION.

29
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:03,068
AMAZON AND STARBUCKS FIGURED OUT

30
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:04,468
THEIR COMPANIES, THEIR

31
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:04,869
BUSINESSES.

32
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:10,942
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW BAD THINGS

33
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:11,676
MUST BE IF AMAZON AND STARBUCKS

34
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:12,277
ARE THREATENING TO LEAVE

35
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:12,610
SEATTLE?

36
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,845
TALK ABOUT A MOTHERSHIP, A

37
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:15,480
LIBERAL COMMUNITY, BUT THERE

38
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,047
THEY WERE.

39
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:17,449
THEY FLEXED THEIR BUSINESS

40
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:18,216
MODEL, REMINDED PEOPLE THAT THEY

41
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:20,852
ARE A BUSINESS IN THE

42
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:22,587
CITY COUNCIL TURNED AROUND ON A

43
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:23,054
DIME.

44
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:24,656
>> Martha: IT SO INTERESTING,

45
00:01:24,656 --> 00:01:25,290
STEVE.

46
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,225
AS BILL HAS JUST POINTED OUT, TO

47
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:30,061
WATCH THIS DYNAMIC AT PLAY,

48
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:31,363
BECAUSE ITS TAXATION, TAXATION,

49
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:32,897
TAXATION AND THEY FINALLY SAID

50
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:33,665
NO.

51
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:35,467
I LOVE THIS QUOTE FROM AMAZON

52
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:36,468
VICE PRESIDENT AND SPOKESMAN

53
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:37,235
DREW HERKIMER WHO SAID THE CITY

54
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:41,840
DOES NOT HAVE A REVENUE PROBLEM,

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,675
IT HAS A SPENDING EFFICIENCY

56
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:44,109
PROBLEM.

57
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,944
THAT PRETTY MUCH SAYS IT ALL,

58
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:46,378
DOESN'T IT?

59
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:48,146
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT, AND I

60
00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:49,748
THINK THAT FRANKLY NOBODY COMES

61
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:50,715
OUT OF THIS WELL.

62
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:52,417
WHAT A RIDICULOUS WAY OF TRYING

63
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:54,652
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF

64
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:55,487
HOMELESSNESS WITH THIS STUPID

65
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:55,854
TAX.

66
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:57,689
THE REASON THAT YOU GOT THIS

67
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,691
HOMELESS PROBLEM IS BECAUSE OF

68
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:00,492
THEIR STUPID POLICIES THAT MAKE

69
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:02,727
HOUSING SO EXPENSIVE, THE

70
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:03,795
REGULATIONS THAT MAKE IT SO

71
00:02:03,795 --> 00:02:06,264
EXPENSIVE TO BUILD A HOUSE.

72
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:08,466
THE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS,

73
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:10,468
THE ZONING REGULATIONS, IT'S

74
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:12,670
CONTRIBUTE TO HOMELESSNESS.

75
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,641
THE IDEA OF SLAPPING ATTACKS ON

76
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:17,308
AMAZON -- BUT FRANKLY DON'T

77
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:21,346
REALLY LIKE THE WAY THEY SAY YOU

78
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:23,648
MAY WANT TO TAX US BUT WE DECIDE

79
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:25,850
WHAT TAXES WE PAY, NOT YOU.

80
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,584
I THINK EVERYBODY COMES OUT OF

81
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:28,720
THIS BAD.

82
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,022
>> Martha: CHOOSE A DIFFERENT

83
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:31,790
STATE IF THEY THINK THAT STATE

84
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,092
IS GOING TO BE BETTER FOR THEM.

85
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:36,394
I DO WANT TO SQUEEZE IN THIS

86
00:02:36,394 --> 00:02:38,663
STORY ABOUT CHICKEN SHAMING.

87
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:39,330
WE HEARD ABOUT FAT SHAMING.

88
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,499
POOR JACK DORSEY, THE TWITTER

89
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:46,404
AND SQUARE CEO TOOK A PICTURE OF

90
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:48,239
THIS CASHBACK PROGRAM HE GOT AT

91
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,608
CHICK-FIL-A AND BOY DID HE GET

92
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:52,644
POUNCED ON BECAUSE THE CEO OF

93
00:02:52,644 --> 00:02:53,645
CHICK-FIL-A IN THE PAST HAS SAID

94
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:56,347
THAT HE IS NOT IN FAVOR OF

95
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:58,249
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, SO THEN

96
00:02:58,249 --> 00:02:59,451
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN JUMPED IN AND

97
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:00,185
SAID THIS IS AN INTERESTING

98
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:02,420
COMPANY TO BOOST DURING PRIDE

99
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:02,720
MONTH.

100
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,356
JACK QUICKLY CAME BACK AND SAID

101
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:08,860
OF HIS TWEET, I'M SO SORRY, YOU

102
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,260
ARE RIGHT.

103
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,663
I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THEIR

104
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:13,364
BACKGROUND.

105
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:17,502
PHIL.

106
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:18,169
>> THE PRESIDENT OF TWITTER

107
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,571
INADVERTENTLY CAME ON THE TRUTH,

108
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:20,305
WHICH IS THAT CHICK-FIL-A IS A

109
00:03:20,305 --> 00:03:21,673
GREAT THING.

110
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:23,074
IT'S A GREAT MEAL.

111
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:24,309
THE ONLY TIME YOU APOLOGIZE OR

112
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:25,310
SAY YOU'RE SORRY FOR HAVING

113
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:25,977
CHICK-FIL-A IS IF YOU FIND A

114
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:30,648
BONE IN IT, WHICH HAS NEVER

115
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:31,316
HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY.

116
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:33,551
>> Martha: ITS BONELESS.

117
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:35,019
>> GO TO ATLANTA AIRPORT.

118
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,188
GO TO SHOPPING CENTERS, WE GO UP

119
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:39,491
AND DOWN INTERSTATE 95.

120
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:42,060
WHERE IS THE LONGEST LINE?

121
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,261
CHICK-FIL-A.

122
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:45,330
I DON'T MUCH APPROVE OF AMAZON'S

123
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,397
POLITICS EITHER.

124
00:03:46,397 --> 00:03:47,465
LIKE STEVE WAS SAYING.

125
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:48,133
BUT I SURE USE THEM.

126
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,901
THIS IS JUST CRAZY.

127
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,236
IT TELLS YOU ABOUT THE SAME TIME

128
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:53,671
THE BULLYING ASPECT THAT STEVE

129
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:54,572
REFERRED TO, BUT ALSO HOW THEY

130
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:59,043
CAN BE INTIMIDATED BY FORCES OF

131
00:03:59,043 --> 00:03:59,677
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.

132
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:00,411
THIS CRAVEN BEHAVIOR IS REALLY

133
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:02,080
SHAMEFUL.

134
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,249
>> Martha: YOU CAN SEND A

135
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:06,050
TWEET AND THE FORCES JUST COME

136
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,652
IN AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU

137
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:09,120
WERE SPINNING YOUR WAY OUT OF

138
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,387
IT.

139
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:12,290
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

140
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,992
>> I FOUND OUT SOMETHING VERY

141
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:14,726
INTERESTING THE DAY BEFORE THIS

142
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:18,062
TWEET BY JACK DORSEY THAT

143
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:20,999
BROUGHT DOWN THE WRATH OF THE

144
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:23,468
HEAT PUMP, HE ALSO SENT OUT

145
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:26,137
ANOTHER TWEET.

146
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:27,705
NOT THAT LONG AGO THE DALAI LAMA

147
00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:28,506
SAID THIS ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE,

148
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:35,113
WHICH IS THE REASON FOR

149
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:36,281
CHICK-FIL-A.

150
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,682
THEY WANT ME TO CONDONE

151
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:38,650
HOMOSEXUALITY.

152
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,018
I AM A BUDDHIST.

153
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,319
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO MEN

154
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:41,853
IS WRONG.

155
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:43,388
MORE RECENTLY HE SAID PEOPLE WHO

156
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:44,889
HAVE BELIEF OR HAVE SPECIAL

157
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,058
TRADITIONS AND YOU SHALL FOLLOW

158
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:48,193
ACCORDING TO YOUR TRADITION.

159
00:04:48,193 --> 00:04:50,862
I DIDN'T NOTICE THE TWITTER HATE

160
00:04:50,862 --> 00:04:53,264
MOB FROM THE LOONY LEFT TO SEND

161
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:54,666
ON JACK DORSEY FOR RE-TWEETING

162
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:55,433
THE DALAI LAMA DESPITE HIS VIEWS

163
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,468
ON HOMOSEXUALITY AND IT MUST

164
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:59,070
MAKE YOU THINK THIS IS NOT

165
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,306
REALLY ABOUT DEFENDING

166
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:03,274
TRADITIONAL VIEWS OF MARRIAGE,

167
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:04,676
IT'S REALLY ABOUT BEING

168
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:05,610
ANTI-CHRISTIAN.

169
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,111
THAT'S WHAT WE USED TO CALL

170
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:07,445
BIGOTRY.

171
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:10,281
>> Martha: QUICK THOUGHT,

172
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:10,882
BILL.

173
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:12,150
>> JACK DORSEY MAY NEXT NEED TO

174
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,884
BE CAREFUL.

175
00:05:12,884 --> 00:00:00,000
HE MAY ORDER A CAKE FROM THE
