1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,422
COMMON GROUND AND BRINGS PEACE

2
00:00:02,422 --> 00:00:04,257
TO THE PENINSULA.

3
00:00:04,257 --> 00:00:06,026
GREG PALKOT IS LIVE IN SEOUL,

4
00:00:06,026 --> 00:00:06,526
SOUTH KOREA.

5
00:00:06,526 --> 00:00:06,826
GREG?

6
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:08,093
>> HI, DANA.

7
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:10,597
THERE'S A LOT OF HOPEFUL BUT

8
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:13,299
CAUTIOUS WATCHING HERE IN SOUTH

9
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:14,234
KOREA.

10
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:16,068
DOINGS IN SINGAPORE, THIS PLACE

11
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:18,304
RIGHT UNDER THE NUCLEAR GUN OF

12
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:19,939
NORTH KOREA IN RECENT MONTHS AND

13
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:21,775
RECENT YEARS.

14
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:24,377
THERE WAS A CONVERSATION ON

15
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:26,046
MONDAY BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP

16
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:28,014
AND SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON

17
00:00:28,014 --> 00:00:28,348
JAE-IN.

18
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:30,784
MOON WISHED HIM HOPES FOR A

19
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:32,786
SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT BUT ALSO

20
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:34,154
WARNED IN A STATEMENT AFTERWARDS

21
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:35,955
THIS COULD ONLY BE THE START OF

22
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:40,293
A PROCESS THAT COULD TAKE YEARS.

23
00:00:40,293 --> 00:00:42,262
WORD FROM SECRETARY STATE POMPEO

24
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:44,998
THAT NEW SECURITY GUARANTEES

25
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:46,266
MIGHT BE OFFERED NORTH KOREA IN

26
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,635
ANY SUMMIT NEGOTIATIONS.

27
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:50,236
THAT HAS FOLKS WONDERING ABOUT

28
00:00:50,236 --> 00:00:52,839
THE STATUS, THE FUTURE STATUS OF

29
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:56,209
SOME 28,500 U.S. TROOPS THAT

30
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:58,478
HAVE BEEN GUARDING THIS PLACE

31
00:00:58,478 --> 00:01:01,181
FOR SOME TIME.

32
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:04,751
ALSO POSSIBLY A FORMAL END TO

33
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:06,152
THE KOREAN WAR.

34
00:01:06,152 --> 00:01:09,322
THAT CONFLICT WAS HALTED WITH A

35
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:11,925
CEASE FIRE, AN ARMISTICE 65

36
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:12,492
YEARS AGO.

37
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:14,227
EVERYBODY WE TALKED TO SAID THAT

38
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:15,929
COULD BE A COMPLICATED ISSUE

39
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:17,430
THAT COULD TAKE TIME TO SORT

40
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:17,730
OUT.

41
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,499
ANOTHER SIGN OF CHANGE ABOUT 35

42
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:21,034
MILES TO THE NORTH OF WHERE WE

43
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:26,339
ARE, ACROSS THE DMZ IN NORTH

44
00:01:26,339 --> 00:01:29,275
KOREA, STATE MEDIA DESCRIBED

45
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:31,344
WITH PICTURES WHAT KIM JONG-UN

46
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:33,680
WAS DOING FOR ITS PUBLIC, THE

47
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,117
ACTIVITIES IN SINGAPORE.

48
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:42,222
THIS IS SOMETHING UNUSUAL.

49
00:01:42,222 --> 00:01:44,124
FINALLY, PRESIDENT TRUMP.

50
00:01:44,124 --> 00:01:46,426
HE'S BEEN SEEN HERE IN MIXED

51
00:01:46,426 --> 00:01:46,726
CREWS.

52
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:49,429
SOMETIMES HE'S DESCRIBED AS MORE

53
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,979
UN PREDICTABLE

54
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,763
UN PREDICTABL

55
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:50,797
UNPRREDICTABL

56
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:50,830
UNPREDDICTABL

57
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:50,864
UNPREDICCTABL

58
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:50,897
UNPREDICTAABL

59
00:01:50,897 --> 00:01:50,930
UNPREDICTABLL

60
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,031
UNPREDICTABLE

61
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:52,065
UNPREDICTABLE A

62
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:52,265
UNPREDICTABLE AS

63
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:52,298
UNPREDICTABLE AS K

64
00:01:52,298 --> 00:01:52,832
UNPREDICTABLE AS KIM

65
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:52,966
UNPREDICTABLE AS KIM JO

66
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:52,999
UNPREDICTABLE AS KIM JONG

67
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:53,032
UNPREDICTABLE AS KIM JONG-U

68
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:53,333
UNPREDICTABLE AS KIM JONG-UN.

69
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,501
PEEP IN THE GOVERNMENT AND

70
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:56,202
PUBLIC SAY HE SHOULD BE GIVEN

71
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:57,570
CREDIT FOR MOVING THIS SITUATION

72
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,973
TO WHERE IT IS NOW, A SIT-DOWN

73
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:02,041
BETWEEN THESE TWO LEADERS.

74
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:05,078
HERE'S WHAT ONE ANALYST TOLD US.

75
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:05,945
TAKE A LISTEN.

76
00:02:05,945 --> 00:02:07,547
>> WE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA

77
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:09,616
WILL BE LOOKING AT IT FROM THE

78
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:12,452
POINT OF VIEW OF WHAT IS IN IT

79
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:14,154
FOR US.

80
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:16,990
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, THIS MAN

81
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,225
IS A REVOLUTIONARY.

82
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:21,895
>> A REVOLUTIONARY?

83
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:22,762
>> HE'S DONE SOMETHING THAT

84
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:25,965
NOBODY ELSE HAS BEEN WILLING TO

85
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:26,533
DO.

86
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:29,035
>> SOMETHING THAT NO ONE ELSE IS

87
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:32,005
WILLING TO DO, SIT DOWN -- WE

88
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:33,439
LEARNED TUESDAY, TWO HOURS

89
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,707
TUESDAY ONE TO ONE.

90
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:35,241
BACK TO YOU.

91
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:37,710
>> Dana: GREG, DO YOU THINK THAT

92
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,513
THE NORTH KOREAN STATE

93
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:42,448
TELEVISION LET THAT INFORMATION

94
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:44,184
KNOWN ABOUT KIM JONG-UN'S

95
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:45,585
WHEREABOUTS BECAUSE OF SOCIAL

96
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:46,619
MEDIA AND THE INTERNET?

97
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:50,223
THEY TRY TO CLAMP DOWN THAT IT'S

98
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:51,758
HARDER TO KEEP INFORMATION LIKE

99
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:53,359
THAT AWAY FROM EVERYBODY.

100
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:55,261
THE SECOND QUESTION, DO YOU FEEL

101
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,263
LIKE THE PEACE DEAL SHOULD BE

102
00:02:57,263 --> 00:02:59,732
HELD BACK BECAUSE IT'S LEVERAGE

103
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:01,234
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

104
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:03,336
STATES IF KIM JONG-UN DOESN'T

105
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:05,338
WANT TO GO THE FULL -- THE

106
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:10,376
COMPLETE VERIFIABLE, IRREVOCABLE

107
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:11,844
DENUCLEARIZATION?

108
00:03:11,844 --> 00:03:13,546
>> DANA, TO YOUR FIRST POINT,

109
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:13,813
YES.

110
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:15,815
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, TOO.

111
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:17,383
FROM OUR TIMES IN NORTH KOREA,

112
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:20,320
WE'RE LEARNING THAT MORE AND

113
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,290
MORE INFORMATION IS GETTING TO

114
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,392
THE PUBLIC IN THE NORTH AND THE

115
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:28,394
REGIME THOUGHT THEY MIGHT NOT

116
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:30,029
HOLD IT BACK.

117
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:31,998
ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT,

118
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:33,533
THIS SHOWS A BIT OF A

119
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:34,901
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IS GOING

120
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,836
ON IN SINGAPORE AND COULD BE

121
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,204
POSITIVELY THAT THE REGIME IS

122
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:39,739
TALKING ABOUT THIS EVENT BEFORE

123
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:40,807
IT HAPPENED.

124
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:43,843
AS FOR THE PEACE TREATY, YES, IT

125
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:48,514
IS NUMBER 1, COMPLICATED, AND

126
00:03:48,514 --> 00:00:00,000
NUMBER 2, COULD BE LEVERAGE FOR
