so it's Black History Month and an NYPD wanted to celebrate well that's great news unfortunately great news oftentimes serves in the bad news in America but hundred precinct put out a tweet and I wanted to show to you guys so this is like I said hundreds precinct in New York City so that particular precinct of the New York Police Department putting this out Jack Johnson became the first african-american man to hold a world heavyweight champion boxing title in 1908 he held on to the belt until 1915 hashtag black lives matter okay I look at that and I say okay wonderful no problem that sounds like a good way to remember Jack Johnson and and other things in black history and way to celebrate black culture okay others looked at and thought how dare they how dare they what well let's find out we've got an anonymous police source in New York City raging about it and demanding answers they say how can a precinct commander lead people where she aligns herself with a group that is known to hate law enforcement and wishes police officers dead she's making a political statement on a job website let's see what the police commissioner does now if they don't take action then I guess a police commissioner and the mayor condone this so what kind of action do we have to take we have to fire people for saying that black lives matter all right so let's break this down in a couple of ways number one does black lives matter as a group want police officers dead not remotely they've never said it no part of any organization as ever Senate there has been one chant that Fox News found and she says over and over again fry them like bacon which we've given you the context for a thousand times with the rest of the media will not report on apparently the protesters were kidding around with the cops who were right there next to them but it doesn't matter okay you don't believe me that's fine fry him like bacon while they had one bad chin did they ever take any action and it was one group in one city no so easy to demonize what is the heart of black lives water what is the overwhelming majority of the black lives matter protesters and organizers want something really simple for black lives to also matter they never asked for more privileges they never said I don't want you to matter to to care about white lives or Asian lives that would be preposterous therefore civil rights they're asking can black lives matter also do they criticize law enforcement from time to time yes do they say we shouldn't have any cops no what do they say they say can the cops also care about us oh my god how dare you no the cops should only care about certain people what is the counter to that shouldn't it be obvious shouldn't we all open our arms and say yes of course blog lives should matter too and of course if they're part of the community that we're supposed to be serving you mean don't agree that what is wrong with you so apparently just simply saying black life should matter is an affront to these cops in New York and a front like black lives should matter god and you wonder why they protest you he's cut you're a shock disagreeing to find out that the community does not trust you when simply saying black lives matter is something that enrages you so much that you think somebody should be fired over it so as long crime reports the tweet was later deleted and replaced the same message in the hashtag hashtag Black History Month now it turns out it wasn't the head of the precinct the woman in its pictured in the tweet that sent it out it was an underling who cares I wish it was her and I would celebrate her I don't know if the in the underling meant to put it black lives matter or meant to put Black History Month it doesn't matter wouldn't it be great if a local police department said yes white lives do matter they matter to us because they're our community and we're here to protect them and we're here to serve them wouldn't that be amazing that apparently is too much to ask for so now look I'm sure the police Commission doesn't want any part of this controversy the mayor doesn't want any part of it everybody gets super angry on both sides the two sides are should the police be reformed in any way shape or form to serve the entire community or should they not know the police are perfect and they shouldn't you don't touch them how dare you criticize them we'll do whatever the hell we want to the community and you'll like it those are your two sides apparently what's the other side what's the other side the black life shouldn't matter that they shouldn't ask for civil rights they should police should never be reformed what's the other side are you telling me that you think that the cops if you're a right winger who hates black lives matter that cops have never abused anyone they've never abused african-americans all the statistics that show you that blacks and whites smoked marijuana at the same rate but blacks are arrested at four times the rate that's all made up I know everything is made up and then one blogger found another statistic that it's in contravention of 99% of the other statistics and maybe climate change doesn't exist and maybe there's an alternate reality and maybe the crowd size for Trump was larger than any other crowd that's ever happened because I live on planet Mars and and everything is different there but the reality is yes of course some cops not all cops but some cops unfortunately a lot of cops in different times in different places have disproportionately targeted african-americans it's not to say that they should all be fired they should all and be fried like bacon it doesn't mean any of that it just says can we reform the police a little bit and so when they ranch so violently in this way so at least some of the cops that reacted to this tweet in the press it gives you a sense not that they need lesser form that perhaps they need more reform now luckily it looks like they're not going to do anything to the precinct captain and NYPD spokesperson said the officials are quote reviewing the Twitter account of the hundredth precinct for all those terrible things that they said about out black lives might actually matter the NYPD admitted however that nothing was likely to come of that investigation noting quote there is no indication that any discipline will be given out the fact that this is even a debate is preposterous and depressing look I personally run into a lot of cops who love the show say great things about us they're part of our audience we've got family members who are cops and some of the hosts and you know on the people who work here but it is also troubling that there is a whole nother set of cops out there who think that that idea of reform to serve everybody in America equally is abhorrent to them we don't know who's who there are a lot of good cops out there and there's a decent amount of bad cops out there and this kind of reaction is not helpful to the community and that means everyone in the community white black Asian it doesn't matter it is counterproductive and disconcerting if we can't Trump trust our cops to protect and to serve us as they are supposed to do are we comfortable giving them badges and guns I want to be comfortable I want the cops wherever it's needed to be reformed enough so that we know that they're serving the whole community and everyone can have peace of mind about what they're doing and that they're here to actually protect us it's not too much to ask for if you want to get the whole young turks show
