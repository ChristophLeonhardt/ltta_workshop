fashion world is embroiled in another racism scandal that's after the cover of Vogue Italy sparked widespread criticism we'll show you the picture of the spark the controversy it features a supermodel Gigi Hadid who some say is unrecognizable here on social media the hashtag black face has been trending over the scandal with people pointing out that Hadid skin hair and facial features were photoshopped and style to appear darker than they really are instead of just hiring someone of a different culture they transform a white girl change her skin and even do her makeup to make her look more ethnic change hair color etc okay this is normal why couldn't you use a black model instead of doing blackface honestly so ignorant and disgusting disappointed in the modeling industry these days if you want a darker skin model than high one there are beautiful dark-skinned girls out there when you see these kind of things happening just like with the H&M campaigns and what other campaigns they don't realize that it affects the emotions of people like you've got a lot of young black girls growing up and they feel like they need to change themselves really has a big effect across the world on a lot of young colored guilt of all different nationalities and races as well there's a lot of very famous models that they could use of color and the situation is is that they were always trying to Photoshop somebody to look different but it doesn't it doesn't enhance it actually takes away and I think it happens in Hollywood also with movies when you have movies that are based in in in Egypt and they use y-axis instead of it's an Egyptian actors I just think that yeah it has a very bad representation what is happening is there's a gray area and I think the boundaries of the gray areas being pushed and pushed them pause and each time that the question is asked is this racism and something happens again is this racism consistency of gray area pushing between what could be racism and what could it be racism and now it's like why it wise people complaining why are people moaning every five minutes about something that may not be racism Gigi Hadid and Vogue Italy have both apologized saying the photo wasn't meant to offend anyone the magazine explained that it was trying to create a beach look with a stylized bronzing effect we spoke to a political commentator and radio host Steve Maltz Berg he believes there's nothing wrong with the photo and that this scandal is all a fuss over nothing I hear you have a beautiful blue-eyed blonde model one of the top models in the world and they put some bronze on her and they photoshopped the picture now she looks I mean you could say she looks black or african-american she looks bronze to me but this is a whole big issue now where people take offence and they call it cultural appropriation in other words you're stealing their culture so it's really out of hand and and we have to get over this in our society or it's going to do a very very much harm so I see nothing wrong with the shoot I think people are too sensitive and I think it's getting out of hand political correctness is getting out of hand you
