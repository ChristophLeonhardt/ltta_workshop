As a conservative,
the words “strike,”
“union” —
not in my vocabulary.
Our students deserve
to have a fully funded
education.
I did vote for Trump.
I consider myself a
Bible-believing Christian.
I’ve always been a fan
of fiscal conservatism.
I’ve always voted
Republican,
but now I’m seeing firsthand
what that gets us.
The classrooms
are falling apart.
We have festering bathrooms.
We have cockroaches.
We have tattered textbooks.
Teachers aren’t
getting the resources
that they need
within the classroom.
A wave of protests sweeping
across the country,
led by teachers who say the
future of public education
is at stake.
Teachers and specifically
public-school teachers
really aren’t valued.
I have to work 15 to
20 extra hours a week
at McDonald’s for minimum wage.
Teaching is my calling.
I love teaching
music to children.
That’s who I am.
And people say,
if you don’t like the money,
go do something else.
I can’t.
I’m 53 years old.
I’m doing what I’m
supposed to do.
I know that I will have to
work until the day I die.
I won’t be able to
afford to ever be retired.
Because of the way
that the state
has chosen to fund education
for the last 15 years,
it’s simply made it
untenable for me to stay.
I’m not leaving teaching.
I am leaving the state
because of these issues.
I don’t believe it’s
going to get fixed.
I just don’t.
We are 43rd across the
nation in teacher salary.
This is why we’re going to
restore additional assistance.
I’m not bragging on 43rd.
I’m just saying we’re not last.
So we’re not just striking
for a higher salary.
We’re striking for
resources for our classrooms
and for our students.
We are at the bottom of
the pile for the states.
We’ve seen teachers
walking out or striking
in West Virginia, in Oklahoma and
some other states successfully.
And we realized that
we were worse off
than some of those states were,
and it just grew like wildfire.
Teachers are riding a
growing wave of anger
over deep education cuts
made by Republican-
led legislatures.
The teacher protests
have been described
by some as a red-state revolt.
I’ve said I’m on the
side of the teachers,
and I’ve been listening,
and we’ve been working.
This will result in a net pay
increase of 20 percent
by the beginning of
school year 2020.
So, on the surface,
that sounds amazing.
It won’t help substitutes,
it won’t help our aides.
It won’t help our
nurses, our front staff.
It comes out of funds that
go to veterans,
people in our population who are
disabled and on Medicaid,
colleges and universities
in our state.
I voted for Governor Ducey
and I was really hopeful.
And now, honestly, I
just feel betrayed.
How can you say you’re pro-life,
and pro-family, and pro-middle class?
Even as a conservative,
I think it’s only fiscally
responsible to increase a tax
to fund public education.
Oh my gosh.
Did I just say it out loud?
I do.
I support a tax.
I will tell you this
right now,
if you are a Republican politician,
you better get behind education.
I’ve been on my feet
for five hours,
waiting on people,
sweeping, mopping.
I probably won’t get to bed until 12:30
or 1 o’clock tonight.
And then I’ve got to be back
up at 6 or 6:30 tomorrow morning.
Good night.
