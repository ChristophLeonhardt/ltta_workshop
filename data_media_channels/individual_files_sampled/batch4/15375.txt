we're here on the board what you can see in the background is Jordan so Jordanian territory and where Sheila and I are stood is Israeli territory and this is a unique enterprise because that bridge you can see there a bridge between Jordan and Israel it's an unthinkable idea but these are the real steps Israel's taking to try and maintain the peace in these lands and I think it's an incredible thing for someone like us who who's outside as you imagine these two borders they will never cross you will never speak we'll never work together but this is a really good example of how the Israelis are trying to maintain peace with actual business related economic development you know this stretch of road that we had to take to get here along the Jordan River it's the largest longest border that Israel has but it's also the most peaceful one but it has not always been that way it's only that way now because decades ago King Hussein expelled the Palestinian troublemakers so that they couldn't shell the road to this region this place behind us will be an economic zone and you know as a Canadian I think you know we're involved in trade with the Americans all the time that's just not the case for the Israelis so that I think this is the first step towards sort of westernizing their market this place behind us this back I don't know if you can see it all the way back there that's a Jordanian village and in that village they have 50 percent unemployment so this cooperative project with the Israeli government with the Israelis paying for the bridge will actually bring about 10,000 jobs to the area and what that does is it makes being paid to commit terrorism a little less advantageous for them because they actually have real jobs they have real economic growth here and I think this is the stuff that we don't see this is what the mainstream isn't talking about where do they say here's the Israelis trying to build relationships with their neighbors this is the stuff the mainstream won't tell and Israel also gets an economic benefit out of this because now they will have access to the Arab world for their products so this is really peace through capitalism and it's a perfect example of why rebel media are here to bring you these stories do hear more from Sheila and myself as we travel around Israel go to rebel is real calm you
