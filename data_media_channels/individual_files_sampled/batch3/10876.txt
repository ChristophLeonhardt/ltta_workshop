a Russian hat I mean if you can't beat them join them I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks I inherit nothing from the Democratic Party what do you mean nothing I mean it was bankrupt it was on the verge of insolvency there is still a very large proportion of the population that is uneasy with women in positions of leadership political and social commentator Mohan Saad joins me on the line now good afternoon to you am I being unfair here it looks to me a bit like Hillary Clinton just can't drop it she can't let it go she's still blaming Russia of her defeat I think there are people who are acknowledging that Hillary has real trouble letting it go I think my concern is some of the things that Hillary's raised the idea that the Democratic Party was more or less bankrupt having seen an Obama presidency for so long and a phenomenally popular president by the way with public poll ratings being very successful although he was being stifled in in passing legislation and this just shows how frail Hillary is I think she gave a speech to the Democratic women leadership convention I think a couple of days ago in Washington and and more or less admitted she just can't let it go and I think it's um I think it's worrying because the US needs a strong opposition right now and Hillary Clinton really isn't it in her book it was called what happened Clinton mention more than 50 reasons for why she lost among them as far as I'm aware not one explaining something she did wrong shouldn't a good leader have that ability to you know self reflect and point out where they went wrong because if she did everything perfectly as it implies surely she would have won yeah and I think the problem is that the Clintons for the longest period in America were the you know this the power couple and have managed everything very very carefully it's been very very sculpted I think one of the things that a lot of people who live overseas outside of the u.s. don't realize because we get a certain perspective we get a certain view Hillary and the Clintons and the Democrats generally is that she is phenomenally viscerally primarily unpopular in America Bernie Sanders I think guarded something like more than more more of the youth vote then Clinton and Trump put together though Trump got more youth vote than than Hillary I think Sardar did very very well that they've both fallen away from politics recently now Hillary does not acknowledge that she was the weakest part of the Democratic campaign even through the election cycle during the debates in the caucuses she did appalling ly she polled poorly people do not like her and one of the things we see as Hillary has a red glint in her eye she does these crazy outbursts I think we saw it when she was in Congo in when was a 2009 when somebody asked her about her husband's trade policies with China and Congolese government or something and she literally lost it and over and over again we saw these weird kind of cackling hyena like laughs and then pulling out the chancre just just now at Yale I mean over and over again she shows that really she's not fit she has a very polarizing effect on American politics the Democratic Party right now is soul-searching it's good they've put in place keith ellison he's a phenomenal representative but the democratic party has lost its soul in america and without having somebody some giant figurehead like queen the queen of American politics and talk shows I don't think we'll really see any great change right now and I think it's likely that Trump will will forward your head in the next election okay so that's all we've got time for pre-shaped so you coming on speaking to us political social commentator mo answer on my guest
