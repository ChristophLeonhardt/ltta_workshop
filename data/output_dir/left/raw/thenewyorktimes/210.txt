1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
“Swamp captain Mitch McConnell
has created millions of jobs

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,570
for China people. While doing so,
Mitch has gotten rich.”

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,310
This is Don Blankenship.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,790
He’s the Trump-like
Republican candidate

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,650
running for Senate
in West Virginia

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,810
who even Donald Trump 
can’t get behind.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,330
“So in a single vote,

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,210
we can vote for Trump’s policies 
and against the swamp.”

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,480
“Both Dons know a thing
or two about creating jobs.”

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,850
Blankenship’s “America
First”-style campaign

11
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,380
hasn’t minced words.

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,840
“D.C. swamp captain
Mitch McConnell

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,420
said he will drop
President Trump like a rock.

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,470
Now he backs false
and negative ads

15
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,760
against Trump supporter
Don Blankenship.”

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,600
“In fact his China
family has given him

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,370
tens of millions of dollars.

18
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,750
The war to drain the swamp

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,240
and create jobs for West
Virginia people has begun.”

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,830
He has spent a
considerable amount

21
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,890
of airtime targeting the family
of Transportation Secretary

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,020
Elaine Chao, 
Mitch McConnell’s wife,

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,710
who is Chinese-American.

24
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,780
He’s a former coal executive
who served a year in prison

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,640
for his role in a
mining explosion

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,990
that killed 29 people in 2010,

27
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,879
a charge he portrays 
as a political conspiracy.

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,290
“Did you know Don
Blankenship’s trial

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,910
was not about the
mine explosion?”

30
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,266
“Really? You sure?”

31
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:11,350
“Oh, yeah.

32
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,250
The Obama judge wouldn’t even
let Don mention the explosion

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,560
and the Obama prosecutors
knew Don had nothing

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,970
to do with the explosion.”

35
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,170
He’s gained support
in coal country

36
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,280
and that’s making Republicans
in Washington nervous.

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,420
A G.O.P.-linked super PAC has even
funded a series of ads against him.

38
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,210
Blankenship has survived
other hiccups as well.

39
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,190
It has been reported that he
actually resides in Las Vegas,

40
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,760
not West Virginia, and is
the only candidate

41
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,610
who hasn’t disclosed his finances.

42
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,040
Voters go to the
ballot box on May 8.

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,110
“I will beat Joe Manchin
and ditch 'cocaine Mitch'

44
00:01:44,110 --> 00:00:00,000
for the sake of the kids.”
