SRCHGHTS IF YOU WANT A DEGREE,
YOU NEED TO STOPWATCHING SO MUCH
-- STOP   WATCHING SO MUCH TV.
WE'VE GOT TO BE MORE GENUINE,
SAY I WANT EVERYTHING THAT GOD
HAS FOR MY LIFE AND SO GOD WANTS
INCREDIBLE THINGS FOR YOUR LIFE.
IF YOU GO ALL-IN, GOD WILL GO
ALL OUT.
>> WHY ARE THE NUMBERS
CONTINUING TO GO DOWN?
HOW DO WE AS A SOCIETY, AS A
COUNTRY, FIX THAT?
HOW DO WE SAY MORE OF US NEED TO
BELIEVE IN SOMETHING BIGGER THAN
OURSELVES?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
IT IS.
BACK IN THE '50s THEY WON'T
IMAGINE HAVING LITTLE LEAGUE AND
OTHER THINGS ON SUNDAY BECAUSE
CHURCH WAS THAT IMPORTANT.
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S BECOME MORE
AND A MORE CASUAL AND SO WE KIND
OF AA PREACH CHURCH AND --
APPROACH CHURCH AND GOD THE WAY
WE WANT TO APPROACH IT AND THE
INVOLVEMENT WE WANT AND SO LIFE
GETS BUSY.
THINGS GET BUSY.
I GET ALL THAT.
I REALLY DO.
BUT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO STOP
AND SAY OKAY, GOD, IF YOU'RE A
GOD THAT LOVES US, YOU'RE A GOD
THAT WANTS THE ABSOLUTE BEST FOR
OUR LIVES, GOD, WE'VE GOT TO GO
ALL-IN.
AND THAT'S WHAT PASTORS -- I
TALK TO A LOT OF PASTORS ACROSS
