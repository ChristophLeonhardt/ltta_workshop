welcome back joining us from Washington with a look at Axios am political reporter for Axios Alexei macam and Alexei good morning to you talks about Axios is one big thing today sure so today's one big thing is about some of my latest reporting showing that Democrats got more votes for their money in every competitive special election since President Trump was elected in 2016 and this is a big deal for Democrats because Democrats and Republicans are sort of going toe-to-toe in the money wars ahead of the 2018 election and Republicans typically have more money than then Democrats do but Democrats spent less money per vote in these special elections and overperformed in every competitive special election since 2016 so how worried should Republicans be in the run-up to the midterms according to your reporting you know the last time that Democrats over performed in this way and and my reporting shows that Democrats have sort of narrowed the partisan gap in these races by 16 percentage points when some reports show they only need Chow performed by three to four points to take back the house the last time they have this over performance was in 2006 when Democrats retook the house with 30 House seats so I think that should certainly worry Republicans it should also worry them that they're spending less resources in these races and over-performing in the way that they have but at the end of the day Democrats need to start winning more of these races if they want to take back the house they only won two of these seven special elections we have highlighted and that's not going to get them more House seats so it seems like it's gonna be a lot less about money and a lot more about message in the rock to November it's definitely coming down to message money certainly helps but only to an extent and candidates are also a big part of this Democrats have put up pretty solid candidates across the board and across the country since 2017 election started Republicans have had some sort of lackluster candidates but it really is driving that message home whether it's from the candidates or from the parties themselves are let's switch gears sir I know the Axios is also looking at how a stormy Daniels's lawyer Michael avenatti who's got actually gonna be on Morning Joe today is sort of a trumping president Trump shall we say at his own game of making headlines talk to me about that sure so Michael avenatti is always on cable news as you said he'll just he'll be on Morning Joe after this he is building a big social media following he's breaking news Twitter teasing big announcements in a sort of reality-show style and that all sounds familiar because that exactly how the president operates himself and you know one thing that Michael avenatti said yesterday when he was on CNN is that he under promises and over sells and I think that is a big part in how he is driving the news and sort of getting under the president's skin yeah and he's obviously been criticized for sort of his PR campaign surrounding all this but but he's also said look it's working right exactly and there will always be critics again he is on cable TV all the time but one interesting thing he said as well about this is that because he is so public and because he is under selling and over-performing people who see him on TV are now apparently according to him giving him information which he's then using to expose new things which i thought was really fascinating all right so we've also been looking at the president's decision on the Iran deal this morning a lot obviously huge news from yesterday I'm Axios has some reporting on the president's thought process through it all tell us what you know a source close to the president told Axios that Trump was in high spirits yesterday before making this high-stakes decision that will have global implications and that makes sense when you think about that this was you know pulling out of the Iran deal was a major campaign staple for the president when he was running in 2016 but the interesting thing is that he was sort of you know gung-ho and very confident yesterday and another White House official told Axios that you know the president loves it when experts in these different fields go on TV and are upset or you know having breakdowns as he calls it about these decisions that he's making he's sort of fueled by that chaos and that controversy and he was apparently in high spirits yesterday ahead of this decision and quickly I know that Ben Rhodes was actually a visited Axios yesterday he was part of the Obama administration major part of the Iran deal as well what did he have to say about the decision you know Ben Rhodes said that this was sort of a bizarre almost short-sighted decision he said that it seems like the president was only thinking about domestic policy and not really thinking about what it means to own Iran and a potential crisis abroad and I think that really speaks to the way that the president operates he's always thinking about making America great again and what it means for us in the United States and less apparent is whether or not he's thinking about the global implications and that sort of what Ben Rhodes said to us yesterday at Axios all right Alexi McCammon forest think you were gonna be reading Axios a.m. in just a little bit and to all our
