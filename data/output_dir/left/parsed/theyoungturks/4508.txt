KELLYANNE CONWAY WENT
ON FOX NEWS LAST NIGHT TO
DEFEND DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR.
THIS TIME SHE BROUGHT PROPS.
LET'S WATCH.
THIS IS HOW I SEE IT SO FAR
TO HELP ALL THE PEOPLE AT HOME.
WHAT IS THE CONCLUSION?
COLLUSION?
I SEE ILLUSION AND
THE LESION.
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,
ILLUSION, DELUSION, YES.
I JUST
THAT WE WOULD HAVE SOME FUN WITH
WORDS BECAUSE YOU ARE RIGHT.
WHAT WAS THAT?
SHE IS THE
OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE COUNSELOR
TO THE PRESIDENT.
SHE NEEDS A
COUNSELOR.
I REMEMBER TIM RUSSERT 
IN THE
BACK THERE WITH THE WHITEBOARD.
WE HAVE COLLUSION, WHETHER THAT
IS A CRIME IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE.
THE CRIMES THAT DONALD TRUMP
JUNIOR COULD BE CHARGED WITH OUR
CAMPAIGN-FINANCE VIOLATIONS, IF
THEY TOOK ANYTHING OF VALUE FROM
A FOREIGN SOURCE.
THERE IS A
POTENTIAL FOR CONSPIRACY.
IF
THEY WERE PLANNING TO TAKE
STOLEN MATERIALS AND RUSSIANS
WOULD HAVE HAD ALMOST CERTAIN
STOLEN MATERIALS ñ THOSE WERE
INTERESTING QUESTIONS.
LET'S
HOPE WE FIND OUT IN A TRIAL.
BUT
DID HE SET OUT TO COLLUDE WITH
THE RUSSIANS?
RELEASE THE EMAILS
THAT SAID HEY, DON, I'M GOING TO
GET YOU A MEETING WITH RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE
LOOKING TO HELP YOUR DAD'S
CAMPAIGN.
AND HE SAID I LOVE IT.
THAT IS COLLUSION WITH WHAT HE
BELIEVED TO BE RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
THE ISSUE
OF COLLUSION IS OVER.
BUT
COLLUSION BY ITSELF, IS A WORD,
NOT A CRIME.
THE CRIME PART IS
INTERESTING BUT IN TERMS OF YOU
CANNOT CROSS THAT COLLUSION,
THERE 
IS 100% COLLUSION.
WE SEE WHAT HIS INTENT WAS.
JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
EXECUTE ñ THAT IS A CRIME.
IF
YOU GO TO ROB A BANK, BUT THAT
BANK IS NOT OPEN, YOU TOOK STEPS
WITH SOMEONE ELSE TO COMMIT THAT
ROBBERY, YOU ACTED IN A
CONSPIRACY AND YOU ARE GUILTY.
THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY IN
AMERICA.
JUST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
FINISH THE ROBBERY DOESN'T MEAN
YOU COMMITTED A CRIMINAL ACT.
I PERSONALLY THINK THAT HER
USE OF THOSE CARDS: SHE PUT FOUR
WORDS AND IT SAID SO MUCH.
SOME
OF THE INTERNET STARTED A
HASHTAG CALLED KELLY CARD
STARTED LED TO THE OBVIOUS THIS.
GENERAL ADVICE TO PEOPLE DON'T
HOLD UP PIECES OF PAPER ON THE
TELEVISION.
THIS IS 
TO 
SHOW YOU
THAT THIS IS OUTSIDE OF JUST
POLITICAL TWITTER OUTSIDE OF
THIS POINT.
I DIDN'T DO THIS, KELLYANNE
CONWAY OR DID THIS ON AIR.
I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED.
SHE IS RIGHT.
BUT THEN SHE WASN'T DONE.
THAT WAS NICE OF HER.
SHE WANTS TO GET MONEY OUT OF
POLITICS.
ONE MORE, JUSTICE
DEMOCRATS.COM.
SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT IS COMING.
INTERESTING
CHOICE ON HER PART.
