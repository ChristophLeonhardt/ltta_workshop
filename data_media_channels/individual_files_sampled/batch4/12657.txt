there are many drawbacks to the online political commentary that now clutters up the internet making it harder to find the porn that I never look at search engines designed to guide you to subjects that interest you end up preventing you from hearing differing points of view so that whether you search for Donald Trump or the budget deficit you end up looking at two naked women in bed together or something else that might interest someone as a result you begin to lose touch with the wide variety of political opinion and instead you're continually reinforcing your own ideas this in turn makes you feel that everyone who disagrees with you is either stupid or crazy or works for ABC News and is therefore not worth listening to so since the daily wire is a conservative website as a public service we're going to be offering you occasionally prim occasional primers on some of the rationales behind left-wing thought so that you can better understand and engage with your left-wing friends today we'll begin with the concept of relativism according to left-wing thought nothing is absolutely good or evil we are only conditioned by our culture to perceive things as good or evil so anyone who thinks his culture is good is evil and anyone who thinks another culture is evil is evil and anyone who's evil is therefore good unless he's evil white men for instance are evil because they think black people are evil and there is no evil so that's not good because there is no good except for blacks who are good because if you think they're evil you're evil because there is no evil women are also good because they're not men who are evil unless they are men in which case that's also good because nothing is good or evil so it can't be evil to be a woman when you're a man so it must be good people who say you're not a woman when you're a woman although you're a man are evil because it's good to be a woman if you're a man unless of course you're just a man who says he's a woman who's a man but are still a man who's a man in which case you're evil oppressing other cultures is evil because other cultures are just as good as our culture because there is no good or evil so to say they're not as good as evil this is also true of oppressing women and gay people unless you're from another culture then that's good or evil wait let me go over this again nothing is good or evil so cultures are good so saying they're not good is evil so we're evil and they're good and when they oppress women that must also be good because to say they're evil is evil but if the women are men then that's not good because of pressing women who are men is evil because women are men and men are women and evil is good and good is evil I hope this explanation has broadened your mind and helped you to understand that our friends on the left aren't stupid or crazy or employed by ABC News or childish dribbling morons barely able to dress themselves employed by ABC News instead they're simply people like you and me trying to understand the world just not this world trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the and relationship I don't know that would have been funnier if I didn't have the sense that President Obama was somewhere listening and going like that makes sense all right it's mailbag day if you see if you had just subscribed you could have been part of this amazing day it's just it's free for 30 days and it's $8 a month but instead you went and you spent your $8 on vast women and cars and now you can't pay back so let's continue we get there's no point in in moving off the subject because it's just it's been so interesting this the aftermath of this horrible horrible atrocity in Orlando the political aftermath has been absolutely fascinating I mean I have to say you know all I try to do is call it the way I see it I mean there's nothing I think about any of this that you don't know because I'm telling you what it is right this minute all these people who said you know the Donald Trump was an important guy because he would blow up the conversation they would explode political correctness right now those people are looking very very good because Trump you know the the left has been just here this is here's the sky who walks in he murders 49 people hurts so many people it's just a horrible horrible tragedy and he is in the thrall of a dangerous ideology he's a Democrat no no he's in the spa he's he's her hat achill Islamist and you know and because he's a gay Democrat radical Islamist that left is just they're tying themselves a knots to my it's the guns it's the fact that he's a man they're blaming Christians is one website that was blaming video games and it said the website just there's no evidence that he looked at video games but there's something wrong with these video games that turn you into it you know it's madness man and Trump comes out and he says duh it's radical Islam and he says a lot of crazy stuff to like you know Obama is on their side and all this stuff but finally this is getting under Obama's skin and the watch something get under Obama's skin is just too much fun in some ways I mean I hate to associate fun with this tragedy but there's something about finally watching somebody blow this guy up because he has been in this fantasy world for eight years while the press is sat there going oh he's a he's wonderful eight they treat him like a child they feel like you doing such a good job you're doing such a good job Obama you know and violently trumpets but asically talking to him like it he's an adult so here's Obama finally just blowing up at Donald Trump for a while now the main contribution of some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made in the fight against ISIL is to criticize this administration and me for not using the phrase radical Islam that's the key they tell us we can't beat ISIL unless we call them radical Islamists what exactly would using this label accomplish what exactly would it change would it make ISIL less committed to trying to kill Americans would it bring in more allies is there a military strategy that is served by this the answer is none of the above calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away this is a political distraction for a while now so suddenly suddenly words don't matter words don't matter thoughts don't matter ideas don't matter words of math let me let me just bring on someone who disagrees with that play play the opposing view don't tell me words don't matter I have a dream just words we all these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal just words we have nothing to fear but fear itself just words just speeches it's true that speeches don't solve all problems but what is also true is if we cannot inspire the country to believe again then it doesn't matter how many policies and plans we have well right exactly because of quiet of course words matter I mean now what else were we doing here but trying to discuss the ideas that are causing people to kill people this guy this guy who killed these people in Orlando he may have been crazy he may have been gay he may have even been he may have even sunk to the level of becoming a Democrat but those are not the reasons he committed these murders he committed these murders in the thrall of an ideology that has spread throughout the world in every country you know he's the left is so provincial all they talk about is the guns in America you know whether guns in America are a problem or not I don't happen to think they are but whether they are or not these guys are killing people all over the world how is confiscating American guns gonna stop them and killing people in Somalia in Afghanistan and Iraq and Iran and all the places around in Russia in Spain in England all those places what are they talking about so suddenly words no matter this is this is the thing when you when you finally undermine their ideas then ideas don't matter if it means that their narrative is going off the rails you know words it's just words it's just words you know all of a sudden so here is and the other thing they're doing by the way and you'll see this throughout the election the left has now a machine in it's in the entertainment industry in the news industry in the universities for demonizing the right to the point where you only have to say the word the name of the right in order to make an argument they did this with Fox News you would say oh I saw on Fox at Fox Fox it was about Fox News you know rush limbaugh is on Rush Limbaugh and they're trying to do this to Donald Trump and the problem with Trump is he kind of deserves it half the time you know but right now he doesn't he has gotten right into their cross so here is Obama saying what the this is classic Obama is this absolutely specious false reasoning in this we're world-weary reasonable voice like how can you not see that every untrue thing I say is true so play Obama three these are the plans since before I was president I've been clear about how extremist groups have perverted Islam to justify terrorism as president I have repeatedly called on our Muslim friends and allies at home and around the world to work with us to reject this twisted interpretation of one of the world's great religions there's not been a moment in my seven-and-a-half years as president where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn't use the label radical Islam not once has an advisor mind said man if we really use that phrase we're going to turn this whole thing around not once so someone seriously thinks that we don't know who we're fighting if there's anyone out there who thinks were confused about who our enemies are that would come as a surprise to the thousands of terrorists who we've taken off the battlefield completely species reasoning you know we know that they're killing some people but we also know that he has let these guys get out of control when they were under control when he came into office it was better when he came into office than it is today it was better under george w bush for all the mistakes he made it was better than it is today he has let this get out of control and it's precisely because he doesn't know who he's fighting it's precisely because he does not know what he's up against and he doesn't you know when he says it's a perversion of a great religion all right I can understand that as a strategy so as not to alienate people but you know the question is as I've said before the question is whether Islamism whether or not Islamism is a natural outgrowth from Islam so ok he's a politician fine he wants to say it's a great religion that's fine but I think there's an open question because when I look at every place that's dominated by Islam every nation dominated by Islam he's an oppressive tyranny every single one turkey trembling on the brink you know I mean it's a just tends toward that so one guy who's gone out of the way and this is I'm gonna go back and answer exactly why Obama is wrong in a minute but before I do I have to say I just have to point out this one guy who just hit the roof is Jim Hoff the guy who created gateway pundit gateway pundit he's one of the most hard-hitting right wing blogs on the Internet so far right a lot of times that it's to the right of me sometimes I'm thinking like whoa gateway pond he goes on my friend Steve malls her boss turns that my friend life just forgotten isn't a show on news max and he announces he comes out that he's gay now he wasn't hiding it from his friends and the people know it but now he's gone public with it and Steve malls Berg asks why he's doing it now tell me why you decided in the aftermath of the attack in Orlando you felt the need to alert the rest of the world as well well and to see Democratic leaders come out and it's they're still in denial Barack Obama his his denial is almost a psychosis now he just can't admit this that this is radical Islam it's shocking to me and III believe he his his policies allow for collateral damage of innocent Americans like the 50 gay men or 49 gaben and were slaughtered in that pulse nightclub on Saturday night he's unwilling to change it infuriates me and and we need a leader who's going to address the issue not talk about gun control but talk about radical Islam I believe the only person who is speaking that way and who has been as Donald Trump and it's disgusting what the Democrat Party is doing right now I'm shocked and that's why I came out I couldn't stay quiet any longer Steve well good for him first of all I mean I'd you know like why should why should he you know this is the thing I've been talking about this whole week is the fact that we have this argument on the right about the the nature of homosexuality the nature of gay marriage and all the stuff and I keep insisting even though I know it makes both sides angry this is an argument between Christians one side is saying you know the the shall not in Christianity and there is a shall not in Christianity and the other side is saying judge not you know that let's be more accepting as as Jesus was in on issues of sexuality in his time it's a it's a perfectly fair argument but if you think it's the same this is the thing that the left keeps saying the left keep saying well it's the same thing if you're opposed to gay marriage you're just on the spectrum of these guys who went in and killed people that's nonsense and if you need to know it's nonsense you only have to see how chick-fil-a you know this is Dan Cathy who's the guy chick-fil-a who runs chick-fil-a and is opposed to gay marriage he immediately sent out chicken you know his meals to the people who are giving blood because he's a Christian because he's not saying I hate gay people he's saying I oppose gay marriage it's a it's a perfectly reasonable theological point to take I disagree with it because of I think the nature of marriage has changed not because I think it's you know I think we are redefining marriage but I think marriage has already already been redefined so I don't think it really matters at this point I think the nature of children and raising children is different and and by the way you know I see the comments that come in I know that a lot of people have a lot of theories about gay people I'll say about that is it's really easy to have theories about people on mass if you don't know any of them you know I mean I really when I hear people kind of go off on black people on this you know if you don't know any people like that of that whatever category you're theorizing about it's a lot easier to have theories about people theories don't really hold water I mean the point is you know a gay guy who is living out his life in a loving way and a respectable way and a good citizen way it's just it's just none of anybody's business it's just nobody's business and it really is not anybody's business and I understand they're bad guys to go around trying for small businesses and attack religion and use this as a wedge to separate those were bad guys you know they're bad guys you know what can I tell you those are bad guys so but but Jim hostas right the only guy saying what he's saying is Donald Trump and he's and what he is saying is true so he's come back to Obama is absolutely perfect I loved it let's let's hear Trump I watched President Obama today and he was more angry at me that he wasn't the shooter and many people said that one of the folks on television said boy is Trump gotten under his skin but he was more angry and a lot of people have said this the level of anger that's the kind of anger he should have for the shooter and these killers that shouldn't be here Hillary Clinton just yesterday used the term radical Islam sort of used it right did you see and they also know Trump Foster I shouldn't be forcing anything if you don't know what the term is and if you don't discuss what the problem is and if you can't say the real name we have a radical Islamic terrorism problem folks we can say we don't we can pretend like Obama that we don't where Obama spent a long time talking about it and nobody at the end of that speech understood anything other than borders he ate Donald Trump I don't know when he's on it when he's on his game he smells blood you know he's like he's a bully and when he gets it when he gets under people's skin he knows it and he smells blood and he realizes this is I think the first time he realizes that the game plan he used in the primaries may work here right now the polls show Hillary the latest poll shows Hillary with like a 12-point lead that's the effect of course of everybody unifying behind her as Bernie goes down in flames the same way he got a jump I'm not saying the Trump can beat her but I am saying that this he's beginning to smell his game and he will find that he's a talented natural politician he will find his game and he understands that this guy Obama has lived in a fantasy world for eight years protected by the press and everybody's like shocked that he the Trump is just coming out and saying what everybody knows it's what everybody knows so it's like you know they make him look like a genius it's just and by the way just to answer Obama what difference does it make what difference it make what words we use it's he's provably wrong he's not just wrong he's provably wrong because we know people saw the San Bernardino shooter was going off the rails but didn't say anything because they didn't want to be seen as bigoted we know people knew at his job at his security job we knew know that the Orlando shooter they knew he was going off the rails but nobody wanted to say anything because they didn't want to say oh it's because he's Muslim Obama has cost people lives with this policy the left has cost people lives with this policy of not saying the truth if you you know lies do that to you so it's when he says oh we've got to get rid of guns because if we save the life of one child he could save the life of a lot more people if he would just notice and say out loud and speak the truth about what is going on in the country all right the mailbag yeah I got a lot of good questions at you know so many questions a lot of them were about Islam this week obviously I kind of avoided some of those because I feel like we've been talking and talking about it nice to talk about something else here is one from George dear Andrew it seems to me that liberals do not believe their own facts whenever I watch a ben shapiro or milo you na police event at a university and some woman brings up the statistic that one in four women will be raped it seems to me that they themselves know they are lying for if they believe their statistic they would never attend college if there was a free flight to europe but i was told that it had a 1 in 4 chance of crashing i would never take it the same seems to apply to the transgender issue no one is demanding that bruce jenner Caitlyn Jenner returned his trophies the question simply is this do you think that liberals actually believe their own lies I think that that is an excellent excellent question and they and the answer is yes and no I mean yes and no they obviously know that what they are saying is illogical I mean they live unlike conservatives who are surrounded by liberal thought this is why conservatives think better than left us because we're surrounded by leftist thought we have to answer all the time we have to answer it all the time every time I turn on the news every time i watch an entertainment show I have to say no that's wrong because this this this and this that sounded good but it's wrong because of this this and this it hones your argument you never go on and get interviewed in Maine in the mainstream without somebody attacking you so it hones your argument they don't have that and the same thing that happens to them is happening to Obama he lives in this bubble in which it is very entirely possible for the human mind to completely get itself and deceive itself so do they know that what they're saying makes sense watch their faces when you challenge their logic something clicks and they go about you know so they have convinced themselves that these things are true even as they don't behave as if they are you know out Algor perfect example flying around on his jet saying the end of the world is nigh buying a house in Santa Barbara that sucks up all the energy if you thought the end of the world is not would you buy a house on the coast you know the first to go but like if anybody said that to him he would have this long you know the fact that the polar bears aren't dying the fact that the oceans aren't rising all that stuff he would have a long explanation but they live in a bubble and in that bubble they believe their lives and when they are disturbed for a moment you can see it in their eyes they come out of it and then they go right back into it again from Jared hey Andrew I was just curious if you have ever read any of the writings of David Foster Wallace and if so what were your thoughts he's the guy wrote Infinite Jest okay I I'm at Kevin Williamson the wonderful terrific writer at the National Review one of the smartest writers on the right and I met him on a bus and didn't know who he was as many years ago before he was really risen and in prominence so we were sitting on a bus going on the NRO Cruise and I just started chatting him up who are you you know what's going on I could tell within about a minute under a minute that this was a brilliant brilliant guy and I started to say well gee what do you know what are you reading what are you enjoying he said oh you've got to read Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace infinite justice look like a thousand pages long okay so I thought this guy is so smart that if he tells me I have to read Infinite Jest I've been putting I was one of those books I was saving for after I was dead if this guy that's how much respect I had for him literally within a minute so I go back and I read Infinite Jest it takes me three months to read this book and what I thought of this is that I thought Wallace was a genius and a drunk and his alcoholism destroyed his genius and I think the book is a utter mess it is an utter mess with about a thousand pages it's got 300 pages in it mostly about Alcoholics Anonymous that is so brilliant that it's mind searing I'll never forget it so I think he was a genius but I don't think he wrote a good book he wrote a chaotic mess of a really horrible book I hear some of his shorter essays are very readable and good and I will go back and read them but I read Infinite Jest I thought it was a mess then next time I saw Kevin I caught what side I said I got a bone to pick with you buddy you may be smart but don't ever all right from al-hafiz hey Andrew I really enjoy your show is there any reason why your show tends to be shorter than Ben's he's overcompensating no I like personally I been covers more ground he does a lot of subjects I like to stick to a theme and a subject and it makes the show naturally shorter and I like to feel at the end of the show that I still have more to say I never want to feel like I'm filling that's that's the way I do it's why it's it's just the way I I react to the pressure of being on is by making sure I have enough to say and he covers a lot more ground and does a lot more subjects and things like that also I'm a writer I've spent most of my life in a room by myself Ben is a natural radio talent I'm a little bit I'm flying a little bit more blind than his the rest of the question is do you too sometimes work together to work on one another shows no I mean we talk often and get into great discussions and you know the with the things he says affect me I think sometimes the things I say affect him and I that's great but we would never interfere with the other guys show from Louie or Lois ello you is Lois are you considering protest voting for Gary Johnson great show by the way well thank you I appreciate I appreciate this side RM I can no I'm not and III will tell you why I am wrestling with this so much that why this is such a difficulty for me a lot of people are saying well I will lodge a protest vote or I won't vote I really have a hard time with that logic and I will try to explain why America America in a way is two countries it is the credible country the country based on our Creed and if it destroys that Creed it ceases to be that country and there is a point when it betrays that Creed so badly that you would be justified in basically walking away from the country as the good Germans were in under Nazi Germany but our country is also our country and when people react to nationalism negatively you know I always think of that poem and I can't remember it for the moment who wrote it lives lives there a man with soul so dead who never to himself has said this is my own my native land you know this is my native land it raised me it nurtured me it gave me everything I have it made me who I am and I love this country in a way that has nothing to do with its Creed you know I love this crew the country's Creed and if it ever fully betrays that creed it'll lose me then it'll lose me and I will absent myself as long but as long as it hasn't fully betrayed that Creed and it hasn't it's still my native land and I feel obligated even though my vote is in California and probably means literally nothing I feel obligated to make a choice between the bad choices that it has thrown up to me and I know they're bad choices I think they're awful choices but I feel obligated to make that choice and I don't feel justified in saying well my country threw up a bad choice so I'm walking away because I love this country they know there was a guy who said he had made a mistake not going to Vietnam because this country was great enough to die for even when it was wrong and that's kinda the way I feel right now obviously not as dramatic but I feel that this country is great enough where even when it makes a mistake and throws up two of the worst people in the country to run it I've got to choose between them and I think it's a terrible choice to have to make but that's why I'm not considering throwing my vote away and it's also why this this election is causing me such a headache you know from Jake hey Andrew in the wake of Orlando I think there's only one question that needs to be answered how do we stop the spread and influence of radical Islam without restricting citizens First Amendment rights I you know I think that it's kind of what we've been talking about all week that the thing is is we don't really need to restrict people from worshiping their God we need to answer people we need to speak up honestly straightforwardly without fear without censorship without calling each other haters about the problem this cancer in Islam and what is its true nature we need to hold people to account you know it's just like you know Obama and Hillary and the left are acting like bad parents you know when your kids act up I've heard people die here people do this on the street I want to shake them that goes but please stop please stop doing that please stay you know that's not the way it works you know when when your kids are being disobedient you have to say look these are the limits this is how we feel this is how we behave in this family and this is what happens if you don't do that you know in some way the leaders of countries have to do that to the citizens they have to say look you cannot believe this you know we instead because of Obama's point of view and the less point of view that they can't attack Islam they leave cops so they can't do their jobs you know they think it's racial profiling all and all this so I think we just have to speak honestly and some of us some of us are gonna have to take the head of being called haters some of us are gonna have to take the hit of maybe being blown away let's hope that doesn't happen but you know we know it has happened he just it is the truth which sets you free and it is the truth which ultimately will defeat it more than guns more than guns it's the truth that will ultimately defeat radical Islam I hope I'm sure I think it will all right let me add also to say thank you to all the people who wrote in and said that you had pre-ordered my book the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ I'm really excited about it it doesn't come out till September but if you think you might like it please go on Amazon or one of the other sites and pre-order it the great good thing it is my memoir and I'm very proud of it and I think a lot of people who have reading the advance copies or giving me great feedback so I think you'll enjoy it stuff I like I've been doing film noir which I love so much all week and I'll come back to it again you know because there's I have but I'm not having half exhausted the number of great film lines but this one maybe it's one of the two best I think Sunset Boulevard if you have never seen Sunset Boulevard if you only think you've seen it if you've only seen scenes from it or you've seen the musical from it you are missing one of the greatest movies ever made it is a uniquely great have you seen it oh man it is a uniquely great movie it is it's 1/2 a crime story half a horror story half a a drama it is a powerful powerful story by Billy Wilder another film he did Double Indemnity - it's a about an down-on-his-luck screenwriter in 40s pegasus 1950 the film came out was late 40s Hollywood who is trying to escape they're trying to repossess his car and he turns into a mansion just by accident he just turns in and what he finds is this crazy silent film star has been played by Gloria Swanson yet Gloria Swanson who this sucks him into her world and it is a weird weird weird movie but so cool and so exciting and the first thing she does to him is she's miss takes him for the pet Undertaker who has come to help her bury her pet monkey and and he then is William Holden plays the screenwriter and he thinks this is hilarious but as he's walking out the door he suddenly recognizes her and this is that scene I know your face what shall I call my servants your Norma Desmond used to be in silent pictures used to be big so they open their big mouths now that's where the popcorn business comes in you buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears look at them in the front offices the masterminds they took the idols and smashed them Fairbanks is the Gilberts the Valentino's and all we got now some nobody don't blame maybe I I'm not an executive just a writer you are writing small words well you've made a role the words and strangle this business ha ha but there's a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles and Technicolor to photograph the Red Storm Tony I am big it's the pictures that got small there's there must be four or five lines are the greatest lines in movie history greatest lines of dialogue and movie history that's one of them the they're very famous I mean if you once you see them once you see the film you'll hear those lines said everywhere ready for my close-up all this stuff it's it's absolutely grateful truly one of at least one of the 20 greatest films ever made and great film more Sunset Boulevard I'm Andrew Clavin this is the end for Clavin show we will wrap up the week tomorrow Thursday and then plunge into the darkness of the clave unless we get so be there I'll see you then
