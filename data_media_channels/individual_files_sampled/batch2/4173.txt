new this morning Pope Francis in the very early morning hours here in the US issuing an extensive letter condemning the abuse described in a scathing report a grand jury reported more than three hundred Pennsylvania priests accused of abusing more than a thousand child victims and the length Roman Catholic Church leaders went to cover up those crimes Pope Francis says quote with shame and repentance we acknowledge as an ecclesiastical community in other words the leadership that we were not where we should have been that we did not act in a timely manner realizing the magnitude and gravity of the damage done to so many lives we showed no care for the little ones we abandon them I want to bring in Sean Daugherty who is a survivor of sexual abuse by a Catholic priest in Pennsylvania you sat next to the Attorney General when he held that press conference which was so i opening to so many people what did you think of the Pope's letter today a lot of it was a repeat of the Attorney General press conference you know he just admitted to what we already know and the rest of it I've heard before I mean zero tolerance we heard that after Boston you know what is zero tolerance with what we didn't hear is I'm sorry I am from this point forward of pleading with the Pennsylvania Senate leadership to enact the recommendations of the grand jury and listen to these victims and help these victims the I don't want to say defenders of the Pope but there are people who would say he is the Pope of a billion Catholics that as egregious and as horrifying as what happened in Pennsylvania is this obviously is a wider problem he's going to be going for example to Ireland where they have had their own sexual abuse scandal and so it's he really has to address this as the leader of all of those people they have been addressing this for how many years I mean we get it you have a sex abuse problem in the Catholic Church we get it been there done that what are you doing to fix it we've heard you know all of these little ones what would you like to see him do what what could you know there's a lot of conversation about extending the statute of limitations whether or not you know leaders in the church in addition to the abusers should be held into legal account where they can be so those are legal questions but in terms of the church what have they not done that's clear to you and other victims that has to be done tell the truth once and for all on everything for Mia culpa they have these records across every state they're secret archives make them unsecret publicize them and also hand them over and to the appropriate authorities the Pope Francis added this I am conscious of the effort and work being carried out in various parts of the world to come up with the necessary means to ensure the safety and protection of the integrity of children and vulnerable adults as well as implementing zero-tolerance and ways of making all those who perpetrate or cover-up these crimes accountable outside of again the legal system and we have seen some of these priests go to jail we also know that some of them who are named in that report are elsewhere now and their parishioners were stunned to see that they were named in this report what does the church need to do when it finds that they have a priest who is abusing children they need to call the police he committed a crime he raped a child do you feel that is not being done here absolutely not if you steal money as a priest from a church you go to jail they prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law and if you rape a child they move you to another parish to a new flock of unsuspecting children and families that have been groomed to receive it what does this meant this report to the folks who you know and I know you know many of them who have kept this so quiet for so long and have had to live with what this has done to their lives first many would argue that they didn't keep it quiet they've been talking about this for decades you know so I think they would say that it's really nice to finally have people listening to it at the scale that everybody is this has been discussed decade after decade after decade it's it's really what is the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church and its parishioners going to collectively do to now help all of these people that they've armed hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
