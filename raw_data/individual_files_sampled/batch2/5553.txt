Joe has a new piece in The Washington Post that questions why rudy giuliani would contaminate himself so terribly it's entitled rudy guiliani goes from America's mayor to Trump's chump any rights in part this why America's mayor would now allow himself to become Trump's chomp is beyond me with many West Wing insiders openly questioning whether the 45th president will even finish his term such short-sighted this makes no sense even when viewed in the most cynical of lights Giuliani has said that in September 2001 during New York's darkest hour he drew strength from Winston Churchill's example and yet poor Rudy couldn't even stay true to his former colleagues for a month once Trump came calling we can all thank God that Churchill and not Giuliani was on guard when Adolf Hitler's actual stormtroopers sought to destroy England and lay waste to the rest of Western civilization because unlike Rudy Giuliani Winston Churchill never blinked this guy Susan Dell / Co has gone beyond blinking he's totally bought in and to everybody's question but Jonathan Turley what's the endgame here well the endgame is not good for anybody who can see clearly and what's so interesting is at the beginning of that piece Joe outlines what a great job Rudy Giuliani did turning around the city that's the administration I was part of that's the Rudy Giuliani I know that's the Rudy Giuliani I miss I mean even when you look at that oh there he is gone he's I mean he used to give a state of the city lay out something lay out with his his vision deliver it without notes he was fantastic this interview we saw the other night was disjointed he went into Pfizer Lawrence where he I mean he should be doing his job which is to represent the president not be his PR guy but be his lawyer and seeing him take this attack now I think knowing Rudy he has a reason for it I just don't see how it turned out to his best century I can't imagine what that would be and as we talked about yesterday the people who are calling stormtroopers are the same FBI light on in the days after 9/11 Lee walked through the streets with the mask on his face the Southern District of New York that issued the subpoena is where he worked himself he was the US attorney in the Southern District these are people he knows has perspective in his way to sell himself out yeah in this way so quickly and let's not forget Rudy said it would be wrapped up in two or three weeks he may be wrapping it up just about now he might be he might be right in that comment flies in the face I mean you quoted yesterday what Michael Cohen's reaction was yeah to the FBI coming in yeah you say it was surprised but they were professional and courteous not storm just past things I just want to pause again Rudy Giuliani you know by the way I know you loved it back then I thought he exploited 9/11 in a way that was a lot of people that he did well respect he went on national television yeah and compared the FBI the guys that risk their lives every day to Nazi storm troopers just let's pause for that a second what a despicable despicable pathetic man I'm sorry yeah Danny Cevallos back to the legal questions Giuliani was when he talked to NBC News last night said that Trump made 12 payments beginning in January of 2017 in installments of $35,000 each to Michael Cohen and then that was the money that was used to pay off Giuliani says unbeknownst to the President to pay off stormy Daniels what are those payments look like to you is that a normal relationship between a client and his attorney is that look like a retainer to you what is that I can see Giuliani strategy what he's trying to do is break up these payments so they don't appear so connected to a hundred and thirty thousand dollar payment after all if Trump reimbursed him dollar for dollar in one payment that would show a real connection through circumstantial evidence but instead what I think Giuliani is trying to do is show that instead Trump paid a certain amount every month to create this sort of pool of retainers slash funds in order to pay settlements as Cohen sees fit the the problem with that approach is at least under the rules of ethics it might create some issues attorneys have to keep their very very separate it's one of the number one reasons why attorneys get in trouble is creating any gray area between the client trust account and their operating account so even if this was reimbursement for a loan made by the attorney which by the way under New York ethics rules attorneys aren't supposed to advance the costs of a settlement they can advance deposition costs and filing fees but paying a settlement and then getting reimbursed is probably running a foul at least in spirit of the rules and then you have the challenge of this payment coming in where did go and put this money did it go right into his operating account did it go into his client trust account and then did he submit hourly invoices and then build that against the client trust account this money creates a paper trail and characterizing it as alone as Jonathan Turley says trips a lot of wires so too does it if you characterize it as a retainer that trips a lot of professional responsibility wires that require accounting and that have questions that need to be answered the other point that Juliana has made over the last couple of days is attorneys do things like this they don't want a burden famous and wealthy people who have busy lives they do things like paying off porn stars without telling their clients does that strike you as a convincing argument it's something that's common among attorneys first I've been on the plaintiff side and the defense side in negotiating settlements and whether it's a gigantic company or a small business the client must be aware of what you're doing on the client's behalf there is no general fund that a large corporation just gives a single attorney to settle cases at will first that's terrible policy for a company if they create an atmosphere where potential plaintiffs know that hey all I have to do is submit a claim and I'll probably get a check for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars one of the things I want to make very very clear even if you're dealing with a gigantic corporation or a gigantic government entity what they see as nuisance value is not a hundred and thirty thousand dollars you can try a case for one hundred and thirty thousand dollars nuisance value even to the largest he's on earth is sometimes $1,000 $2,000 it's not a hundred and thirty thousand dollars and believe me $130,000 may not be a lot of their overall worth but it creates a paper trail and the bosses want to model more of a paper trail go ahead Mike so Danny one hundred and thirty thousand dollars now Michael Colin indicates that he got the hundred and thirty thousand dollars as part of a home equity loan that's where he drew the money from so the multiple payments from Donald Trump to Michael Cohen where does the danger the peril of bank fraud exist here I have several concerns about this any kind of home any kind of loan that Michael Cohen applied for he would have had to make representations on paper or electronically and I don't know that he would have put down that this loan is in order to pay off an adult-film star and route it through essential consultants of Delaware company again the more explanations that Trump and Giuliani offer for the money the more layers they create and each layer requires an explanation at least at minimum to the government maybe to the IRS and the the challenge is that money especially in our digital era money has to wake up somewhere and it has to go to sleep somewhere and that must be documented so each time they create think they're creating more space they're actually creating more layers that have to be accounted for there are layers of lies that are clear here it's clear the president lied we've got you know on one side of things Michael avenatti looking at this payment alluding to another payment of 1.5 million dollars that might be related to Trump in some way pertaining to a woman that at some point will have to surface in some way I just don't know what Trump and his chumps think is going to come up this there's no good way whether it's Muller or the Southern District they're gonna follow the money they're gonna follow the paperwork they're going to get to the end of this so people like Rudy Giuliani are just making things if it's possible even worse Danny Cevallos thank you appreciate your
