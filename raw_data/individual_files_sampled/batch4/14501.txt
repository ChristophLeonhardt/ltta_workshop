the mainstream media hit an all-time fake news high over the last couple of days we're gonna analyze NBC went beyond embarrassing itself yesterday now in this climate news outlets should care about accuracy the veracity of their reporting because they're being accused of being fake news many many times a day by President Trump his allies even people like me other conservatives out there Kurt Schlichter many the people you know from the rebel and from other sources well NBC yesterday reported it was a ridiculously silly report NBC reported that Michael Cohen's phones were wiretapped that President Trump was picked up calling Michael Cohen from the White House on a wiretap and that Rudy Giuliani warned him against the things he said except none of it happened they had a trap not a tap on Michael Cohen's lines in other words they were able to see who was calling him and when they were calling they were not able to listen to the sum and substance of the phone calls that is a very significant difference but it didn't matter to NBC now I don't want to hear any more of that well it's young reporters editors putting these stories together and they don't understand the investigative nuances of tapping trap and that's what they're paid to do they're paid to report the truth now Fox News did a a good recap on the story and I'll read you some of the excerpts Fox News has learned that federal investigators kept a register a phone call as said made by President Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen but those calls were not recorded horses with knowledge of the proceedings told Fox News that investigators used a pen register or dialed number recorder on at least one of Cohen's phone a pen register records all numbers dialed from a given phone as well as the length of each all that's very very different than a wiretap that listens in now come winter whoever Tom winter is oh he's an Emma said me he's an NBC investigations he tweeted I don't really listen that goes on it these days but Tom winter uh reported on this then he tweeted out yesterday evening about 5:30 Eastern Time correction earlier today NBC News and this reporter said that Michael Cohen's phone lines were wiretap three senior US officials now dispute that being the monitoring was limited to a log of calls a pen register not a wiretap wiretap of Cohen's line we will continue to report why did that story run in the first place are there no editorial standards in the mainstream media anymore look I tell you this all the time but I mean it I could never have reported that story here at the rebel my managing editor would never have let me report that story forced the way this story was this is NBC they have four more editorial resources than we do but it doesn't seem to matter it doesn't seem to matter now NBC also reported according to Fox like I mentioned a bit ago at the New York City uh New York City is one time Mayor Rudy Giuliani now on Trump's legal team learn the Trump had made a post raid call to Cohen and Giuliani reportedly told Trump not to call again out of concern that the conversation could be recorded but I don't know if I believe that I don't believe anything the mainstream media says nothing because I think at this point their concern with is gotcha it's saying haha we were right about Russia collusion we're gonna vindicate Jake Tapper and and and and brian Stelter and Maggie Haberman and Glen thrush and the Washington Post editorial board and our friends over at CBS and ABC and MSNBC we've got to make sure they're right and the MSNBC rather the mainstream media cabal led by outlets like MSNBC and CNN and ABC and CBS near Times The Washington Post they're all in this together they all help the Democrats push this false narrative of Russia collusion and now they're trying to figure out how to make fantasy a reality do they have to because they're completely discredited people are moving the Fox people are moving to outlets like the rebel and our digital competitors and colleagues Sinclair Broadcasting the largest owner of independent television stations in the country is about to do a deal with tributing company and acquisition and they are going to challenge for the conservative news space the liberal media the liberal media might have an audience in people that hate Donald Trump but what they don't have is credibility and without credibility you have nothing you're an echo chamber this report is beyond bad now I know we're desensitized to fake news we're incredibly he's sensitized to all this but we shouldn't be we shouldn't be and we're desensitized to it because we're so used to it the mainstream media has begun to do something it's so hysterical about Donald Trump that when they get a sliver of red meat that could possibly be damaging to him they're far more concerned with being first put that news out and they are with being right in bringing you accurate reporting and that is the antithesis of what the news business is supposed to be travesty it serves no purpose and it really really does a great job of undermining the public trust what if you bring into this content every
