some parts of the country it does seem like the America that we know and love doesn't exist anymore massive demographic changes have been foisted upon the American people and their changes that none of us have were voted for and most of us don't like from Virginia to California we see stark examples of how radically in some ways the country has changed now much of this is related to both illegal and in some cases legal immigration that of course progressives love and since this is the last speech that I will give as president I think it's fitting to leave one final thought an observation about a country which I love it was stated best in a letter I received not long ago a man wrote me and said you can go to live in France but you cannot become a Frenchman you can go to live in Germany or Turkey or Japan but you cannot become a German a Turk or Japanese but anyone from any corner of the Lord of the earth can come to live in America and become an American so nearly 30 years separate that separate those moments Joe but I mean watching Ronald Reagan speak that way actually brings me to tears right now especially seeing the way Laura Ingraham really tried to encapsulate her vision of America right before that it is one beautiful outlook of how we have become this beautiful country versus something very trashy very ugly and very sad well Ronald Reagan is so uplifting because as Ronald Reagan always he had this beautiful talent to reconnect us with whom we were to remind us that about that dream that was and that is America and even when we fall short and we've fallen short so many times through the years it's that dream you know the dream that all men all women are created equal and also that dream that you can go to France but you can't become a Frenchman you can go to Germany but you can't become a German you can come to America and as general Hayden said it's pretty simple you read the document you understand the document you pledge allegiance to the document and we shake your hand and you are every bit as much of an American as me and other people who have been here for four hundred years just like that that's the magic of America and guess what no president no radio talk-show host no white supremacists in Virginia can ever change that you know guy Benson a strong conservative voice wrote this on Twitter overnight as conservatives we should not fear or bemoan demographically shifting electorate it's our task to make our cause relevant and accessible to more people including those who may not initially be natural allies and make them secure and the confidence that our ideas are better and you know Jon Meacham I remember in 1999 George W Bush a man who I disagreed with many of george w bush's policies with his spending george w bush quietly and publicly told republicans in no uncertain terms and running in 2000 and one of the major focuses of my major focus will be to reawaken the republican party to the importance to reaching out to those who may not be just like us to hispanics especially the largest growing demographic group in america we have got to put this nativism behind us this is this soft bigotry as white supremacy they would call this which is looking more and more like white supremacy these days and George W Bush and his re-election bid got what 43 44 percent of the Hispanic vote because he did what guy Benson said conservatives today need to do make their views accessible and relevant and you look at just as recently as John McCain who manages to remember he says when a questioner probably the kind of questioner that Laura was talking about who's not happy with the way the country is changing he says he's you know Obama's a Muslim and and and you know McCain shuts quite courageously shuts the the woman down in 2008 2012 Governor Romney a figure who his dad was born in Mexico because he was a part of the Mormon missionary family it was just an internationalist view it was a it was a party that for all of its faults and all institutions on this side of paradise are flawed for all of its faults it was about that Reaganesque vision of all the pilgrims from all the lost places hurtling through the darkness toward home and that is in such extreme distress now that people who have been Republicans for longer than 30 minutes seems to me need to fight for that part of their party or say goodbye for a very long time we're gonna we have Susan Dale Percy Oh Donny Deutsch and Gene Robinson with us as well and we'll stay on the spirit of that's discussion willie Geist Michael Gerson has a really good piece out in the Washington Post about the politics at play and then we'll get to some stunning nudie tales pertaining some of the court proceedings with migrant children and families seeking asylum but first Willy the politics at play yeah speaking of George W Bush Michael Gerson was a speechwriter and a senior adviser to President Bush during both of his terms and Gerson has a new column on this topic in the Washington Post titled the only way to save the GOP is to defeat it in it Michael writes in November many Republican leaners and independents will face a difficult decision the National Democratic Party under Nancy Pelosi and Charles E Schumer doesn't share their views or values but President Trump is a rolling disaster of mendacity corruption and Prejudice what should they do they should vote Democratic in their house race no matter who the Democrats put forward and they should vote Republican in Senate races with mainstream candidates unlike say Corey Stewart in Virginia why vote strategically in this case because American politics is in the midst of an emergency if Democrats gain control of the house but not the Senate they will be a check on the president without becoming a threat to his best policies from a Republican perspective or able to enact their worst policies the tax cut will stand the Senate will still approve conservative judges but the house will conduct real oversight hearings and expose both Russian influence and administration corruption under Republican control important committees such as chairman Devin Nunez as House Intelligence Committee have become scraping sniveling panting and pathetic tools of the executive branch only Democratic control can drain this particular swamp Susan Dell / CEO you've worked in Republican politics for a long time what do you make of Gerson's taken in this moment well it's hard to hear and I'm a little torn about it because I do think you should vote for who you think is the best candidate playing the strategic voting game is always a little difficult it typically doesn't work out the way you want it so I think if there are Republicans who you can support as a Republican you should vote for them why should you vote for a lesser candidate if you don't think that they're up for the challenge so that's my first point the second point is is that if you feel that a Republican for Congress especially in the house has been an enabler of Donald Trump don't vote for them it doesn't mean you have to vote for the Democrat but it means you shouldn't vote for an enabler of Donald Trump Joe what do you think yeah I mean it's it it's tough I mean it's very difficult I remember in Gene Robinson in 2006 I remember writing writing a column making the same argument along with Christopher Buckley and other Republicans who said there has to be checks on and we're talking about george w bush but on an administration that mishandled iraq that was talking about exporting democracy to for all you know to ending tyranny on all four corners of the globe through the united states military which is already overstretched we were post-katrina but there was this feeling that there had to be a check and there are times that you have to vote strategically and it would be different if the legislative branch were actually an independent functioning branch of this government of madison's brilliant design to check a government of checks and balances but as we've been saying here all year gene the founding fathers they foresaw a corrupt tyrannical president they never first saw an obsequious Congress legislative branch that would lie down and simply rubber stamp all of the worst proposals of this a tyrannical president and whatever you want to define Donald Trump he is not Madison and Jefferson and Franklin and Washington's idea of a president no no he's clearly not and you know I think the founders would be a you know would be shocked that that Congress hasn't acted not just to investigate this president probably to in pieces president remember they were revolutionaries and they they a-absolutely specifically planned for this sort of moment and and this this Congress is is beyond negligent is beyond it's it's it's beyond pathetic really I think it's it's a crime against the Constitution that they're not fulfilling their duty even to investigate they're protecting the president from exposure of his corruption there are enabling this this president who and let's be certain what the contrast is you heard that that Laura Ingraham well I mean that's arm that let's not say that sounds like white supremacy or a smells like it I mean that's what it is that's what it is more as simple and this is a president who is encouraging that and and to say nothing of all the other things that this president does that they're just beyond the pale so I agree with my Kirsten and George F will vote Democratic yeah Michael Gerson mentioned Corey Stewart in his piece stewardess the Republican nominee for the US Senate in Virginia and it's responding after a video surfaced from his 2017 virginia governor campaign in which he praised the confederacy for rebelling against the Union this is of George Washington Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and James Monroe it's a state that the founders it's a state of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution but it's also the state of Robert and Lady installed Jackson and jev Stewart because at the basement Virginia's we think for ourselves we did the revolution we did it in the Civil War and we're doing it today Stuart who grew up in Minnesota of course he did he grew our jigna they're always the worst late 20s transplants in a I'm a rebel is facing incumbent Democrat Tim Kaine this November Stuart responded to the video by telling CNN quote unlike wimpy Tim Kaine really Virginians have a warrior spirit and a rebel heart and in a tweet yesterday that Stuart has since deleted he attacked Michigan Democratic candidate for governor Abdullah Al Syed as a quote Isis commie yeah oh my god there were these people yeah they're caught we're no where's he coming Franco's Minnesota and he's trying to play tough southern Minnesotans are usually nice people yeah I know he's not but he should go back instead of trying to of tough southern Johnny Jim I really I don't know where to start except unfortunately you could find far too many examples of these sort of posers this guy posing as a southerner as as a son of the Confederacy but all of this talk from Laura Ingraham and Corey Stewart overlooks one small detail of American history that many Americans say said the same ignorant thing hundreds of years ago and 150 years ago when the Irish came they said the same ignorant things when the Germans came he said the same ignorant things when the Italians came to America there have been a a small segment of know-nothings who have been saying new things about immigrants coming to this country for over two hundred and forty years and yet you know I ticked off a list a couple of days ago of immigrants their families that came recently and transform Silicon Valley if we had Donald Trump and Cory Stewart's view of America then you wouldn't have had Steve Jobs over here you wouldn't have had the founder of Google over here the founder of Yahoo over here the founder of Reddit over here the founder of eBay over here I mean yeah and if we want to go back a few years even Albert Einstein may have ended up at a Nazi concentration camp with Donald Trump's viewpoint on immigration it's it's extraordinary that we're still having this conversation and in 2018 but we're gonna have to keep having it again and again the the talk about the Confederacy and the talk about secession as a as a success or to the revolution and as a southerner abhorrent the the south this is the civil war let's just say it quickly here was about the institution of slavery it was about the perpetuation of that institution it was a struggle to end the journey enshrined in the preamble of the Constitution toward a more perfect union those soldiers took up arms against the Constitution of the United States and would have ended the great American experiment that led to say victory in World War two that led to say victory over Soviet Communism in the in the deadliest potential struggle in human history over the 40 years or more of the Cold War it was in and if anyone who doubts that and and so good start start tweeting the you know we can talk about this for them for the rest of the year but that's what it was about and when people try to appropriate it and we're approaching this is the weekend of the anniversary of the terrible violence in Charlotte's ville where president the United States one year ago you may remember had a hard time figuring out which side of the argument he was on neo-nazis and Klansmen or the people who were standing up for the America you just described and that is one of the many reasons we have a crisis in in the moral leadership of the country and and Donny Deutsch the hypocrisy of course as always when it comes to Donald Trump it's just a Goering here this guy has been fighting against Shane migration oh my god this is the most evil thing of all time you're not with Jane my grace what happens is you bring in ms-13 and they're gonna come in and they're gonna shoot up your white neighborhood and go to your white malls and shoot up your white malls and they're gonna they're gonna go to your white high schools and shoot up your white light you know of course as we've said before ms-13 accounts for far less than 1% of the the illegal immigrants that come to this country but Shane Migration must in word now my law rights Donald Trump except for the fact Donnie his in-laws have been trying to get into the country on Shane migration and yesterday Melania Trump spirits became US citizens through how does he miss that the same chain migration route that Donald Trump has been demonizing for a year now yeah of course there's the the rules for all of us and his rules for Donald Trump and this is I mean if the apocrypha is not know why they needs to be new word beyond hippocrates describe that you know going back to the laura ingram thing and the thing is that laura ingram must be on some cable access to being to get on the AI actually get on and say that oh wait no wait she's on Fox she's on a major network and says that basically make America white again her whole argument beyond being reprehensible and completely counter to what we're about is also false in the sense of that our shifting demographics has very little to do with immigration and the reality is actually as of 2007 every year babies being born in this country White's now of the minority it's happening in this country it's not about oh people are pouring on the borders as we speak it's who we are now you can't put the genie back in the bottle nor should we put the genie back that's who we are and you know Donald Trump once and for all we need to just really look at what his slogan make America great again means we know what it means we know what it meant make America white again and that's what that slogan always was the dog whistle was there and the fact that now 18 months into his presidency that we have people like Laura Ingraham just blatantly as Jeanne said there's no softy of bigoted racist comments guys whether you like it or not we are a mosaic it's not changing it's who we are and even if you built the wall which is not gonna happen it's who we are and thank God it's who we are well and Alex if you can get that Ronald Reagan clip again that we started the block with we'll get it to end the block because there are a lot of conservatives that have claimed to be disciples of Ronald Reagan and this has actually been happening for years now actually the rub people run around quoting Ronald Reagan and and temperamentally ideologically it's in every way possible they are in fact the antithesis of Ronald Reagan and are against everything Ronald Reagan stood for and you certainly could talk about big government the fact that these so-called conservatives in Congress along with Donald Trump have passed the largest spending bill ever have the largest federal debt ever exploded the the deficit the yearly deficit have been more fiscally irresponsible than any Congress in US history and yet and yet they still claim the mantle of Reagan while they're being demagogues do we do we have that Reagan clip Alex that we can that we can run I'll tell you what Mika why don't we go out to break on it now just tell all my conservative friends take a good close look at what Ronald Reagan said because it's very telling he didn't say this in like June of 1986 this was his farewell speech to America still add on morning gel what do we have mica well we'll tell you about a mother and a daughter deported to El Salvador but a judge steps in and orders the plane to be turned around that story's coming up you're watching Morning Joe we'll be right back and here's the Reagan and since this is the last speech that I will give as president I think it's fitting to leave one final thought an observation about a country which I love it was stated best in a letter I received not long ago a man wrote me and said you can go to live in France but you cannot become a Frenchman you can go to live in Germany or Turkey or Japan but you cannot become a German a Turk or Japanese but anyone from any corner of the Lord of the earth can come to live in America and become an American thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you
