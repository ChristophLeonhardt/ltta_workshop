I think he's a visionary I think he's clearly a talented young man I think there's a general litmus test though for when a company is about to take a huge fall and that is the CEO ends up on the cover of fashion magazines he was recently on Italian Vogue whether it was Marissa Mayer in Vogue magazine or David Karp or Dennis Crowley and gap and j.crew ads it shows that the the CEOs priorities are all up and it's a bad sign for shareholders I would argue the big four Apple Amazon Facebook and Google the CEOs of those companies wrapped themselves in a progressive blanket because progressives are generally seen as being nice but weak where as conservatives are generally perceived as being smart than me and if we had a smart but mean person or that perception running a company as powerful as these regulators would step in but because Tim Cook is seen as a very nice guy first openly gay CEO of a fortune 500 company Facebook is very likable hey everybody lean in they wrap themselves in this very progressive non-threatening blanket and as a result they're able to disguise what are kind of the spawn of Darwin and Darth Vader in terms of their business practices and wrap themselves in a rainbow or a very pink or a very progressive blanket that in my opinion kind of staves off or creates a head-fake or an illusion for regulators Microsoft was not nearly as likable the folks running that firm we're nearly as likable and regulators stepped in
