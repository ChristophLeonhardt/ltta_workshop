the Labour Party may have just dropped Mandy Richards the conspiracy theories from their candidacy in Worcester but this isn't the first time the parties had some real nut cases run for election and even win for the party this week the Labour Party dropped Mandy Richards as their candidate for Worcester which is a key swing see in the next general election he came out that Mandy's actually just some mental conspiracy theorists I mean I know Labour's not he's only got a great track record of people in their party being upstanding citizens but this one's a real corker she seemed to question the Manchester bombing which is pretty gross asking why there were no images of the bomb damage following the attack it also came up that she's actually been given 14 civil restraining orders by the High Court they banned her from taking legal action without a judge's permission on vexatious claims against mi5 mi6 Thames Water and Hackney councils so she's got a lot of beef with a lot of different people but there's more on it's gold it's real gold it was reported that she said the death of Johnny sledge a band member from Sister Sledge was a result of some kind of hidden part she said how many more shocked celebrity deaths before high incidence is called into question okay so celebrities don't die of natural causes obviously now it's also reported that she said the concept of the movie Inception begs the question of how many dream manipulation used to induce behavior in military or potential terror attackers say what what what does this mean she also blamed her loss as a Labour candidate in the 2016 London Assembly elections yes so she lost and she blamed it on a conspiracy between the Labour group progress and the returning officer how did they not catch this gap woman sooner had they not catch her sooner clearly she's off a rocker but she's not as I say she's not the first person they've had so I just want to run through five of my favorites my favorite nutcases in the Labour Party so first off there's the story of Simon Parkes he's a Labour councillor who says his real mother was a nine foot green a thoroughly amazing he says that he was adopted as a baby by nine-foot tall green alien which explained that she was his real more important mother later when he was 11 she took him on board with her spacecraft and a deal was shot about contact between the two worlds ah okay then there's another she's that's not the only alien story this one article from Chronicle live whitney counselor claims aliens are influencing president Putin's actions in the Ukraine conflict and here he is with his droppage Simon with his drawing of an alien called Mantid and there are two green beings which look like my other mum but they don't have a purple cloak on ah amazing they've got some imaginations on them and it actually enters my mind through my eyes it sends a message which I feel going down my optic nerve into my brain and it says I'm your real mother I am your real mother I am your more important mother oh and it turns out it's not my five favorite candidates is my five favorite stories because it turns out the next story in The Huffington Post is a another alien story it's the same guy Simon Parkes Labour councillor says sex with an alien is causing problems in my marriage oh yeah yeah a Labour councillor has claimed that he's fathered a child with an alien and that the regular sex he has with the extra-terrestrial is causing tension in his human marriage you know isn't it funny that you have these nutcases in the Labour Party but when it came out that one of the councillors a new kit for instance blamed the weather on gay people certainly UKIP's legitimacy is called into question but there's no cases in the Labour Party as well here's another one as well on guida forks labour candidates say Salisbury poisoning was arranged by Boris this is poor Eustace standing in Worthing in Sussex and he says after filling Salisbury with soldiers in frightening plastic suits we discover the deadly nerve agent is not deadly at all our KGB assassin so useless they put too much water with it I think it was arranged by Boris to get attention amazing and finally in Birmingham live we've got a story that says Birmingham Labour candidate apologizes after saying no proof that Isis exists I don't really have anything to say about that Safiya naught 25 has been selected as Labour's new candidate for the Small Heath Ward in elections next yeah so is it incredible the the hypocrisy by the way as I say when when anyone from another party a right-wing party says anything crazy the whole party's legitimacy is called into question but the Labour Party is littered with stuff like this by the way and it's not all funny some of its really terrible the Labour Party is littered with Islamists Isis supporters and a general extremist communists socialists nasty folk with some nasty ideas and yet they dare to call the legitimacy of other parties into question hmm just something to think about hope you enjoyed it if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to download our app on the Apple
