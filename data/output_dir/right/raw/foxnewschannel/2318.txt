CHANCE THE RAPPER AND

39
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:54,708
CANDACE OWENS.

40
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,476
FROM THE OUTSIDE, CAN LOOK

41
00:00:56,476 --> 00:00:58,512
LIKE A GIGANTIC CONVERSATION

42
00:00:58,512 --> 00:00:59,980
BEING HAD INSIDE THE BLACK

43
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,680
COMMUNITY ABOUT FREE

44
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,850
THINKING AND THE DEMOCRATIC

45
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,051
PARTY IS THAT HAPPENING AND

46
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:05,585
IS IT CREATING AN

47
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:05,986
OPPORTUNITY.

48
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:07,554
>> I HONESTLY THINK THAT

49
00:01:07,554 --> 00:01:08,622
KANYE WEST RIGHT NOW IS

50
00:01:08,622 --> 00:01:09,890
BEING USED AS A POLITICAL

51
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,958
PAWN TO CONTINUE THIS TRUMP

52
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:12,325
MOVEMENT.

53
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:14,961
AND I THINK THAT THIS JUST

54
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:16,997
IS ANOTHER DISINGENUOUS AND

55
00:01:16,997 --> 00:01:18,632
QUITE FRANKLY INSULTING

56
00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:19,533
POLITICAL STRATEGY THAT WE

57
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:20,934
SEE BOTH ON THE LEFT AND ON

58
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:23,203
THE RIGHT.

59
00:01:23,203 --> 00:01:24,704
AND WHICH POLITICIANS PANDER

60
00:01:24,704 --> 00:01:27,240
TO BLACK VOTERS BY USING

61
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,276
CULTURAL INFLUENCES TO GAIN

62
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:31,344
THEIR SUPPORT WHILE REALLY

63
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:33,814
DOING NOTHING FOR THE BLACK

64
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:34,181
COMMUNITY.

65
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:35,115
I DON'T THINK THAT

66
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:36,583
AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE UPSET

67
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,819
AT THE FACT THAT CHANCE THE

68
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,155
RAPPER OR KANYE ACTUALLY

69
00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:43,123
SUPPORT CONSERVATIVES.

70
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,591
I THINK IT'S THE TIME OF

71
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:45,392
CONSERVATIVES THAT THEY ARE

72
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:46,193
ACTUALLY SUPPORTING.

73
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:48,295
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL

74
00:01:48,295 --> 00:01:50,897
NOT DENOUNCE WHITE SUPREMACY

75
00:01:50,897 --> 00:01:52,666
OR WHITE NATIONALIST.

76
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,100
PETE: HE HAS DENOUNCED WHITE

77
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,168
SUPREMACY AND WHITE

78
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:55,569
NATIONALISM.

79
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:57,137
>> BUT HE HAS ALSO SAID THAT

80
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:58,872
THERE IS GOOD AND BAD PEOPLE

81
00:01:58,872 --> 00:02:00,640
WITHIN THE WHITE NATIONALIST

82
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,309
NETWORK WHICH I JUST THINK

83
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:03,109
IS WRONG.

84
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:04,177
PETE: THERE ARE GOOD AND BAD

85
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:04,678
PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.

86
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:07,180
>> THERE ARE NOT GOOD WHITE

87
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,681
NATIONALISTS.

88
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:08,348
PETE: I DIDN'T SAY THAT I

89
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:09,014
SAID EVERYWHERE.

90
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:10,817
HE WAS DENOUNCED WHITE

91
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:11,685
NATIONALISM HE HAS DONE IT

92
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:12,486
MANY TIMES.

93
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:13,353
DARREN, IT WAS ACTUALLY

94
00:02:13,353 --> 00:02:14,488
THOUGH, YOU WANT TO TALK

95
00:02:14,488 --> 00:02:16,523
ABOUT USING MOMENTS, IT WAS

96
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:17,457
KANYE THAT STARTED.

97
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:18,391
THIS HE IS THE ONE THAT

98
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,394
RESPONDED TO CANDACE OWENS.

99
00:02:21,394 --> 00:02:22,696
HE TWEETED THIS RECENTLY HE

100
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:24,064
SAID I HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH

101
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:25,565
RESEARCH ON CONSERVATIVES TO

102
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:26,600
BE CALLED ONE.

103
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,969
I'M JUST REFUSING TO BE

104
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:30,470
ENSLAVED BY MONOLITHIC

105
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,804
THOUGHT.

106
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:33,039
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT

107
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,640
FREE-THINKING AND THE

108
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,641
ABILITY TO SPEAK YOUR MIND.

109
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:37,410
>> I THINK FREE THINKING IS

110
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,012
THE IMPORTANT PART OF THIS.

111
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:40,380
LOOK AT CELEBRITY MARKET.

112
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,015
HIGHLY LEFTIST DEMOCRATS AND

113
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:43,783
THEY ALWAYS HAVE THIS

114
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:47,420
PROVOKING WAY OF GETTING

115
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,054
AFRICAN-AMERICANS INTO THE

116
00:02:48,054 --> 00:02:48,922
DEMOCRATIC PARTY NO MATTER

117
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:49,556
WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

118
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:50,724
BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER

119
00:02:50,724 --> 00:02:52,259
IS YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO

120
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:54,060
CONSIDERATION KANYE'S VIEW.

121
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,828
KANYE UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE

122
00:02:54,828 --> 00:02:55,862
IS A LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS

123
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:57,197
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING.

124
00:02:57,197 --> 00:02:59,866
WHEN WE LOOK AT

125
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:00,734
SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

126
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:01,401
WITHIN THE TRUMP

127
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:03,169
ADMINISTRATION, IT'S REALLY

128
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:04,437
BENEFITED THE

129
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:05,105
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.

130
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:06,339
WHEN WE LOOK AT A LOT OF

131
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:08,174
THESE ISSUES THAT THE

132
00:03:08,174 --> 00:03:08,842

IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN

138
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:16,316
COMMUNITIES AS A RESULT OF

139
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:17,350
TRUMP BEING IN OFFICE.

140
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,152
YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO

141
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:19,853
CONSIDERATION WHEN DONALD

142
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:20,587
TRUMP, EXCUSE ME, WHEN

PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS IN

00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:23,890
OFFICE, HE INCARCERATED MORE

145
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,991
AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAN ANY

146
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:26,226
OTHER PRESIDENT WITH

147
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:27,260
EXCLUSION OF BILL CLINTON.

148
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,296
WE GO BACK TO THE 1994 CRIME

149
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:32,632
BILL BY -- THAT WAS ENABLED

150
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:34,701
BY BILL CLINTON WE HAD

151
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:35,835
MONSTROUS NUMBERS OF

152
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:36,336
AFRICAN-AMERICANS

153
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:37,270
INCARCERATED AS A RESULT OF

154
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,604
THAT.

155
00:03:37,604 --> 00:03:38,939
TRUMP IS MOVING FORWARD.

156
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:41,274
WE ARE LOOKING IN EXCESS OF

157
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:42,275
3% G.D.P. AND THEREFORE I

158
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:43,643
SEE THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS

159
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:44,110
BENEFITING.

160
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,512
WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT KANYE

161
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:47,147
STATED, I THINK HE IS JUST

162
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:48,114
LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE AS

163
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:50,750
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO BENEFIT

164
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,552
THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN

165
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:52,986
COMMUNITY.

166
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:53,787
PETE: KANYE TWEETED ABOUT

167
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:54,888
CHICAGO SAYING THIS OBAMA

168
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:56,389
WAS IN OFFICE FOR 8 YEARS

169
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:57,324
AND NOTHING IN CHICAGO

170
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:57,657
CHANGED.

171
00:03:57,657 --> 00:03:58,925
IS THIS A REFLECTION OF THE

172
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:00,026
FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING

173
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:01,761
I HAVE BEEN PANDERED TO FOR

174
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:02,696
A LONG TIME OR MY

175
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:03,863
CELEBRITIES HAVE BEEN PUT UP

176
00:04:03,863 --> 00:04:05,765
ON A PEDESTAL BUT MY LIFE

177
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:06,232
HASN'T CHANGED.

178
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:08,768
>> YES.

179
00:04:08,902 --> 00:04:10,003
STORY IS A PERFECT

180
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:11,104
DEMONSTRATION OF THE

181
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:13,773
HYPOCRISY AND THE EXTREME

182
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:15,108
INTOLERANCE OF THE LIBERAL

183
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:15,408
LEFT.

184
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,810
THEY SAY WE WANT BLACK

185
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,712
PEOPLE'S VOICE TO STAND UP

186
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:20,012
AND SPEAK OUT AND THEN THE

187
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:21,915
MOMENT A BLACK MAN STANDS UP

188
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:23,550
AND SAYS SOMETHING CONTRARY

189
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,985
TO THE AGENDA OF THE LEFT,

190
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:28,722
HE IS IMMEDIATELY MET WITH

191
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:31,224
SWIFT AND CRUEL PUNISHMENT.

192
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:33,927
FOR ME TO SAY I AM BLACK,

193
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:36,930
BUT I AM NOT A DEMOCRAT IS

194
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,264
SEEN AS BETRAYAL IN THE

195
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:39,032
BLACK COMMUNITY.

196
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:40,734
I LOST ALMOST ALL OF MY

197
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:43,036
BLACK FRIENDS DURING THE

198
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:44,904
2016 ELECTION BECAUSE THERE

199
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:47,273
IS ABSOLUTELY NO ROOM FOR

200
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:48,475
INDEPENDENT THINKING IN THE

201
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:49,809
BLACK COMMUNITY WHEN IT

202
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,978
COMES, ESPECIALLY TO

203
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:52,345
POLITICS.

204
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:54,614
I REMEMBER MICHELLE OBAMA

205
00:04:54,614 --> 00:04:57,083
BEING ON TV 1 WHICH IS A

206
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:57,617
PREDOMINANTLY BLACK

207
00:04:57,617 --> 00:04:58,585
TELEVISION STATION AND SHE

208
00:04:58,585 --> 00:04:59,953
SAID IT DOES NOT MATTER WHO

209
00:04:59,953 --> 00:05:01,321
IS ON THAT BALLOT.

210
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:02,722
IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT THEY

211
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:03,023
SAID.

212
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:04,457
IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT THEY

213
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:05,291
HAVE DONE.

214
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,828
YOU JUST VOTE DEMOCRAT

215
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:09,763
MEANING SHUT UP BLACK

216
00:05:09,763 --> 00:05:11,097
PEOPLE, GET IN LINE AND DO

217
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:12,032
AS YOU ARE TOLD.

218
00:05:12,032 --> 00:05:14,834
IT REMINDED ME THAT NOT ALL

219
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:15,769
OVERSEERS ON PLANTATIONS

220
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:16,369
WERE WHITE.

221
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:17,771
THERE WERE BLACK AS WELL AND

222
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:20,707
THEY WERE CALLED DRIVERS.

223
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:21,341
PETE: UNFORTUNATELY I'M

224
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,642
BEING TOLD IN MY EAR WE HAVE

225
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:24,544
TO LEAVE IT RIGHT THERE.

226
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:26,012
WE WILL BRING YOU BACK VERY

227
00:05:26,012 --> 00:05:26,312
SOON.

228
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:27,013
THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT

229
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:27,480
NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

230
00:05:27,480 --> 00:00:00,000
>> IT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO
