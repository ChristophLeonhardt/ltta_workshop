the United States reinforces harsh sanctions on Iran but both allies and adversaries refused to follow the Trump administration's leave is this a new blow to American leadership or the first sign a new global power structure is beginning to emerge this is inside story hello and welcome to the program unheard abdul hamid earlier this week washington reimpose their wide range of sanctions on Iran the move followed the u.s. decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement formerly known as the jcpoa the trump administration called on other powers to join it but also issued a threat telling governments to choose do business with America or Iran not both the response has been a nearly universal know some of Washington's closest allies have even promised legislation to protect their own companies against possible American reprisals are you at all concerned that countries like China India Russia to reduce oil imports from Iran zero we're making progress on that we think these sanctions are biting already and we think they will continue to bite and cause significant negative economic consequences for a rock we really just encourage the United States to start talking to its partners and Iran in order to be able to find a route forward personally in the meeting I had with President Trump I made it clear that if the American intelligence has information that creates a different picture in terms of nuclear proliferation that was originally acquired and the agreement that was reached is no longer effective and if there had to be additional checks my opinion Italy has to be willing to steer the relation with Iran in this direction this is not the first time the US has tried to force other countries to go along with this unilateral sanctions in 1996 the us past the helms-burton Act a law strengthening the embargo against Cuba by penalizing foreign companies doing business there another law dating from 1977 forced American companies not to follow the Arab boycott of Israel but extraterritorial sanctions have sometimes been successful in 2014 before the nuclear deal came into place US sanctions on Iran hit France largest bank BNP paribas agreed to pay the US Justice Department an eight point nine billion dollar fine so let's bring in our panel in New Jersey Steven Rogers member of the Donald J Trump for president advisory board in Birmingham in the UK Scott Lucas professor of political science and International Studies at the University of Birmingham and in London a nice abus City Tabrizi Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute welcome to you all Stephen Rogers let me start with you why does the u.s. always assume that everybody has to just follow its lead even if they don't agree well the u.s. doesn't automatically assume that the president under President Trump SCID ministration he believes in negotiating everything that he does now look with regard to Iran the question each leader around the world has to answer is what has Iran done to advance world peace the answer is nothing so the fact that it matter is is that the regime has done nothing but create misbehavior around the world has not lived up to its obligations regarding that horrible deal and the United States is no longer on an apology tour as President Obama was there's a new sheriff in town his name is Donald Trump business is not going to be as usual the EU and NATO in other countries have always wanted the United States government to take the lead on a lot of worldwide issues President Trump is doing that and now they've got to make decisions as to what side of the issue they're gonna stand with and at the end of the day believe me they will stand with the United States Scott Lucas we just heard there is that you know the u.s. says that Iran doesn't help for world peace well it's pulling out of the deal or jeopardizing this deal going to bring any kind of world peace or bring us close to it first of all I I don't give two hoots for campaign talk I mean I care about political economic and military affects I'm not a big fan of Iranian foreign policy and what it's doing in the region for example its support of the Assad regime in Syria with the killing of hundreds of thousands of people but when we're talking about the deal itself the deal is not quote the worst deal in history the deal actually was containing Iran's nuclear program ninety-eight percent of uranium had been taken outside the country it had restricted development of centrifuges it had Iran was adhering to the deal in other words if you really want to deal with Middle Eastern problems you needed to take the nuclear issue off the table the deal did that by ripping up the deal partly out of Donald Trump's fight over Barack Obama and partly because of pursuit of regime change you put the nuclear back in you destabilize the region you don't make it any better so and it's a Tabrizi is there feeling in Europe really that the u.s. just pulled the rug from under the European countries feet I think so I think the Europeans have done their best that you come to terms with even what were perceived as the the concerns over the deal the main things being the absence of the missile issue from the deal the so-called sunset clause and the type of inspection that are supposed to be conducted under the deal the Europeans have been working with the u.s. to try to address some of these concerns and according to the same US State Department there was significant progress between January and May when the decision was taken by the u.s. to withdraw from the deal to add Assad is concerned despite that the Trump administration decided to withdraw the u.s. from the deal and put the Europeans in a very difficult position the Europeans continue to be committed to the survival of the deal and as we know they continue to strengthen their support for it and to implement legislation that it's going to make it possible even with limitation for Iran to continue to a bar is an obligation but of course it's going to be very tricky for the Europeans and Russia and China to enable the deal to survive without the u.s. being a party of it okay Steve I just need to understand this JC poa deal is a multilateral deal with several countries involved now the u.s. is going alone on this so far you seem quite confident in your first answer that everyone else will follow suit but why not also listen to the position of the Europeans their concerns and also why not give them some leeway when it comes to their own relationship or they're part of that deal the president is listening to the other world leaders I remember when he was involved with discussions with NATO and there was a narrative around the world that he's breaking NATO up that he's not listening to NATO leaders and at the end of the day NATO rallied behind the president and they began to pay their wave with regard to military you know the military might in the region etc look it's easy to blame the United States for everything but the reality is the Iranian government is not taking care of its people the United States government is not the threat that Iran needs to worry about it's its own people just look at what we're seeing there at on the streets in Iran they're tighter their government they're tired of corruption they're tired of Iran sending more money to create mischief around the world to there than their own people the president of the United States has made it clear that he loves the Iranian people we in America want good relations with the people but it's the government that needs to be held accountable it's the government in Iran that needs to be held responsible for its own actions well anything in reality there have been 11 consecutive reports by the nuclear agency and all of them said that you was complying so if you are now any other country in the world and if you are North Korea for example and you're looking at what is happening why would you even negotiate with the US if you know a change of commander-in-chief will also mean a change of agreement yeah I mean absolutely in terms of how trustworthy the United States looks to the international community this is something that of course has been raised by a number of countries including of course the Iranians but also going back to Steve's point I think about the economic pressure and the role that sanctions are playing and also the reaction of the different parties and companies to these sanctions I just wanted to remind it also of the fact that already in 2010 2012 there was the strongest set of sanctions which were imposed against Iran there was a UN Security Council resolution there were Union earliest sanction imposed by the United States by the European Union and by a number of additional countries Australia Canada you name it and even then not only the Iranian regime did not collapse economically but also the whole negotiation point that he's making did not really change the change came once rouhani came to power Iran dropped the zero Richmond policy and a number of issues came to line so either we come to the realization that pressure economic pressure did not work in the past and we are far away from the type and level of economic pressure that was exerted in the past now because of the lack of global support to the United States or there will be a continued lack of strategic policy from the United States to worse Iran moving forward ok Scott Lucas now Europe is not happy about this it made it clear yet Steve has a point that several companies have already decided to comply with these sanctions so does he also have a point that in the end Europe will have to follow suit or does it have any exit of all of that or that will it have to develop its own policy what can it do really the EU can protect smaller companies maybe medium-sized companies but it can't necessarily cover billions of dollars in protracted legal action so that's why you've seen companies like total in France like PSA the French car manufacturer like Siemens and Dame were in Germany saying we have to suspend business for now but beyond that then you've got this fantasy world that Steve and that Donald Trump are in look Donald Trump is not beloved by NATO members that was a fantasy that you just heard there the idea has been not only on this issue but on others that the US can bully others Emmanuel macron appealed to Trump do not pull out of this deal Teresa may appeal to Trump do not pull out of this deal and the Americans through that back in their faces so in the longer term the question is where will your up stand economically and politically not only on the Iran issue but on other issues when you can no longer trust the administration in Washington and Steve this sort of rift with the EU isn't that something that concerns Washington the concerns the Trump administration it has been since at least world war two the closest ally things are changing now in the world isn't that a concern at all president Trump is known as a great negotiator look there were three presidents of the Baltic States here in the United States a couple months ago and the common theme that they articulated at their press conference was that we trust Donald Trump we trust his judgment there is no fantasy world here it is not a fantasy when the president of the United States somehow through good negotiations got NATO countries to pay their fair share with regard to economic and military aid that is exactly what happened that is exactly what happened and notice I talked earlier it's a barrage campaign talk this is not campaign talk this is reality on the and you're doing what the US media does you're you're creating a false narrative based on nonsense the fact that matter is Donald Donald Trump's in any other pit he would protect the American people first and he's doing that um Scott that's reality you don't seem to agree with any of that okay look I I mean it for what it matters on the NATO issue the NATO members did not agree and bowed out a Donald Trump they agreed to continue the path of increased expenditure that they've been on since so that's Washington spent on the broader point and the important when you're talking about Iran is that you have this sort of not only the idea that if Donald Trump shouts everyone will follow and that makes him a great negotiator when in fact there's a lot of distrust as Donald Trump is a negotiator including amongst the leaders of the Baltic States by the way but then it's also the idea that in Iran the Iranian people are just waiting for liberation there waiting for regime change and if you put this together what it's saying is is that the Iranian people who are caught between hardliners in their system and the Americans if the Americans put an economic gun to their heads and say rise up that's when the Iranians will hit the streets actually some opponents to the regime in Iran say that usually when sanctions happen or hard situations like that it actually emboldened the regime moving on any say I just also want if you're Iran post the deal in 2015 Iran has looked to the to do Europe mainly for its contracts and its business dealings now it's looking at Russia for example as a plan-b Russia and China are both against the unilateral move of the US should Iran will we see Iran moving a bit more eastwards or will they also be a bit more pragmatic and say well at the end of the day President Trump is in power for two years maybe six at the most and they'll just ride the wave after all they used to that well I think it's gonna be a mixture these two tendencies so of course we know that the preference of the rouhani administration has been since the very beginning since 2013 to improve relations with the European partners and he has stressed that from a political perspective and economic perspective so I don't see the European preference dropping anytime soon of course because of the limitation of the European tools available to protect what the Scot was mentioning and referring to so small and medium enterprises it's going to be difficult for Iran just to rely on Europe so they are going to look at Russia and China we have already seen a number of statements and discussion about new agreements on the energy sector infrastructure sector between Iran and Russia and China and that has been also the tendency that we have seen during the toughest round of sanctions the 2010 2014 period in particular to basically enable Iran to continue to some extent its oil export and its investment in the gas fields but also to the infrastructure by looking into the Eastern partners so I think it's going to be a mixture of the two policies if rouhani could choose if we go with Europe we know that by fact but because he will need to prioritize also the situation of the Iranian economy and also the continuation of its relationship with Russia and China who have been supporting Iran throughout all the difficulties and all the sanctioning position then these partners are going to be also looked at very closely by Iran as well okay Steve so now President Trump said clearly you either do business with us or you do business with Iran China said it will continue to do business with Iran Russia is pledging up possibly up to 15 billion dollars investment in the oil and gas industry in Iran the you might have a legislation pass a legislation that will protect its own companies where does that really leave president Trump on all of this it's he's quite isolated from his diplomatic partners on this specific issue well a couple of points so the economy of Russia is not good China's having some economic problems at the end of the day each of the countries in the EU are gonna have to answer one question do you trust Iran Russia and China or do you trust the United States and at the end of the day we will find that they trust the United States but saying that all of what they're doing they're positioning themselves into bringing their ideas as we said earlier to the negotiating table with President Trump so all this is a family squabble NATO the EU the European countries who we've had relationships forever we're gonna continue to have great relations but the president is a tough negotiator and at the end of the day either deal with a country Iran that exports a turret that exports mischief worldwide or you're gonna work with the United States government who is trying to lead the the world not only United States but the world into some stability and peace so that's the answer that these individuals are going to have to or the question that they're gonna have to answer and they'll answer it by coming eventually to the side of the United States on this issue Scott Lucas one could also argue that actually all the u.s. administrations have had more or less the same kind of approach when it wants to impose something on the international community maybe the difference is not in substance but actually in form but it's nothing new coming out of Washington at the end of the day why I think that's an interesting point because I think we have seen previous administrations try to get very tough on Iran we certainly have seen that for example with the George W Bush administration when they even considered regime change we saw it with the Obama administration when in fact you know they took a fairly tough line to lead up to the 2015 agreement but the huge difference here is is that there was cooperation between those administrations and between partners such as the Europeans and indeed between Russia and China who are other parties to the agreement because you knew the rules you knew you could work with the State Department you knew you could work with the National Security Council and there was an element of trust here what has happened is that a combination of certain officials in Washington such as the National Security Advisor John Bolton who is committed to regime change and just the volatile nature of Donald Trump who has very little knowledge about the issue but just wanted to rip this up because Barack Obama did it means that the rules are gone you can't trust dealing with Trump you know and again Steve wants to make this into a fantasy where Trump is like the leader of this coalition well I'd love a rainbow unicorn for Christmas but it ain't gonna happen I think we will however see countries be cautious we will see for example China be cautious as to how much it defies the u.s. we will see countries like India and Russia maneuver so I think in the short term the u.s. probably holds certain cards to put pressure on the Iranians to cause cracks in the economy but it's beyond this short term that we get real uncertainty not only about the relationship with the Iran but indeed the u.s. position in the region and beyond and Steve you you seem to have something to add yeah look under the Obama administration and in Scott I'd love you to respond to this what about that jet with cold cash millions of dollars of cash in the secret of the night landing in Iran that's how the administration's dealt with that's how they dealt with Iran behind in secret behind everybody's back we have a President of the United States who's very apparent who's very clear on his physicians no one has to ever guess where he is so you you want to talk fantasy well there was a fantasy land when the Obama administration was in thinking that and this is all this is a problem with our country before Trump that we could just use our dollars to pay anybody off well Donald Trump is not gonna do that they're very gonna be a planeload of cold cash for the record Iran I'm just gonna be haven't we're running out of times I just want to give the final word to a Nisei I mean you've heard it you gentlemen here but again going back to Iran and indeed to the rest of the world do you think that with all what's going on we might see a new way coming out from the U on how to deal with for example Washington primarily Washington I would say are they gonna be able to forge their own European Way and be a bit more independent and briefly please because we're reaching the end of the show that's a very good question I think it's very noteworthy to understand that the Europeans were not thinking they were going to be able to reach consensus a unanimous decision to implement the legislation that was just approved the EU blocking regulation which might be a political tool and not be as effective as we wish in terms of protecting the European companies and financial institution from the USS secondary sanctions but I think because of precisely the nature of the situation and the fact that they don't trust the United States anymore on the Iran issue even if they have been trying to work with them they saw that the decision was taken unilaterally and without consideration of the consequences and most importantly Iran is abiding by its own obligation and therefore the Europeans don't really see any reason why the jcpoa should be jeopardized so I think the situation is very complicated I'm sorry I'm just gonna have to interrupt you because we have actually reached the end of the show so I'm gonna thank our guest Steven Rogers Scott Lucas and any
