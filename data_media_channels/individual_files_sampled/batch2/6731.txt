the Republican Party has a new campaign theme and a new strategy to help them and I'll make sure this midterm isn't so bad they are deploying an oldy fear did you know that left-wing protestors are coming for you and your family and are going to literally kill you that's it has disseminated from Donald Trump and like the the inner circle that was pushing for Cavanaugh to literally everyone in right-wing media right-wing politicians Mitch McConnell saying I'm really proud of my members for not knuckling under to those kinds of mob like tactics under Cavanaugh and secondly we were literally under assault he says fact-check they were not literally under assault somebody yelled at them maybe that maybe that too an incredibly privileged person who has not like participated as an actual member of America for literally decades that seems like literal assault it is not actually literal assault but it goes beyond just Mitch McConnell here is a mash-up of some of the examples of this tactic we refuse to be intimidated by the mob of people no to mob rule unthinkable you don't hand matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob and that's what they've become but this is the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I've seen basically according to mob rule what we have learned is the resistance that has existed since the day after the November 16 2016 election is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged mob rule the tactics that have been employed both by Judiciary Committee Democratic senators and by the you know the virtual mob that's assaulted all of us in the course of this process has turned our base on fire my members dealing with we've got under assault Laura their homes have been just me everybody I mean they've they've been after all of us we've sort of been under assault and everybody decided to stand up to the mob we were literally under assault these demonstrators are sure some of them were well-meaning citizens but many are more obviously trained to get in our faces to go to our homes up there basically almost attack us and the halls of the Capitol and remember this is how they're responding to getting this accused sexual assault our honor the Supreme Court for three or four decades so that's not enough they get the Supreme Court justice they also want you to be very calm about the entire thing so as I said this has become common not just amongst politicians it is also all throughout right-wing pundit REE according to cable news transcription database TV eyes since the Labor Day weekend the term mob rule was said 89 times on Fox News which was more than double than that was was uttered on either CNN or MSNBC and the terms violent or violence Fox News feature those words 60% more than its competitors we have examples of that as well so 89 times in a short period of time on Fox News but also as we've been talking about today quite a few times on MSNBC and CNN as well yes so that that was those numbers came in before the last 24 hours and if you turned on cable news in the last 24 hours all you're hearing is mob mob mob mob mob so they might have doubled it in the last 24 hours so but to me yes John the more disturbing number is CNN and MSNBC then picking up the baton and and some folks on MSNBC might disagree or CNN might disagree that it's mob violence but whatever the Republicans start a talking point it gets on fire and the whole country talks about it and they know how to drive that propaganda perfectly Democrats I mean you you couldn't start a talking point if your life depended on it right so once the Republicans have started this conversation it's one that in a sense they can't lose so the question is how violent is the left like it's still one of those questions like when did you stop beating your wife it's a question you can't answer in a way that yeah that is a positive right and so net and and they do it on purpose and what would the reason we showed you that tape yeah really great job by Washington Post putting out together is because it gives you a sense of it is orchestrated it's not like they had a genuine opinion like oh my god I'm really concerned I'm gonna go out there and give a speech because that seemed like a mob or anything no they got together in a caucus they decided that we're gonna use the word mob to gin up fear in their base because their base look here's the thing that I'll say that almost no one else in the media will say because they're so worried they're gonna lose ratings if you insult Republicans but their base are cowards so it's super easy to scare them oh my god the Latinos are coming they're coming across the border oh my god the Muslims are coming they passed anti Sharia laws in Oklahoma really the Muslims are taking over Oklahoma that's what's happening okay dragons yeah well I mean look dragon like those are scarier yeah I mean honestly so I it's nearly equal in its absurdity wait but hold on Jencks so look yes Mitch McConnell is saying that the senators are being mobbed but they wouldn't actually go on Fox News that implied it regular conservative voters are gonna be attacked right cue the tape tax firsthand and they're ugly aren't they Tommy they're ugly and they're getting worse and I just have to say for the record I've been Doc's filed I've had things sent to my home both in Texas and now in California I've had people confront me in public so this is not just something that our Senators representatives are going through it's really anyone who sits right of center anyone who's a trump supporter we're all target's of this and it extends beyond those at the whole public office so yeah the average citizen if you're on the right should be concerned and in danger should be concerned and in danger I I sort of get what she's trying to say there yeah so all of them should be scared because people wearing pussy hats are coming for you yeah from the resistance as Chuck Grassley would say they come to your house and make you bake a cake for them that's what they're gonna do be really afraid really afraid can I say one thing about this tactic I know you're gonna go back through the through the history of it but there is an amazing thing as while many Republican elected officials are generally the dimmer politicians there is an amazing elasticity and flexibility in the conservative mind because they're able to believe mutually contradictory things in a way that most lives can't so they're now holding simultaneously in their brains that these leftists are so angry that they're going to come and they're gonna tear you apart they are a violent mob also there are a bunch of soy boys who won't stick up for themselves hate guns don't get weapons don't respect the military all of that so there's simultaneously too weak and not masculine and the most dangerous force in a universe that's such a great point John and they need a safe space wait a minute what you're sensitive yeah it sounded like you need a safe space that's kind of ironic okay so now look should you now you have to do the caveat should you go and actually threaten them of course not but it's not what progressives stand for can you find one person who was on the left who's done an act of violence yes that guy who shot up the softball field right and shot Steve Scalise are the acts of violence overwhelmingly on the right absolutely that's a stone-cold fact not only do they go after you know public figures but they've also killed the right extreme right wingers have killed cops all across the country doctor yeah and and doctors that's right and committed acts of terrorism and the list goes on and on so that right wing claiming that the left is the mob is I mean it's preposterous beyond a description so now let's remember the things that they have done okay in 2010 when the Tea Party was protesting well those are Patriots okay they were good people now I remember a lot of people getting angry and being in a crowd and and even spitting on Democratic congressmen right and but that was a mob that wasn't a mob threatening them by the way yelling racial slurs at them right that was and by the way you know what the Republican politicians did at this point when they came to the Capitol the Republicans got up on the balcony of the Capitol and egged on the guys yelling racial slurs so now now they're concerned about a mob okay now here's the you won't talk about an orchestrated mob we mentioned this yesterday kiss Donald Trump hilariously tweeted that they're all being paid by Soros but not getting paid none of that is of course true okay and he's of course the one who actually paid supporters to show up in actors to pretend to be supporters in his first appearance anyway here's the scene from miami-dade back in 2000 so this is a group of people who pretended to be genuine citizens who were mad that they were actually counting the vote in Florida they did not want the vote to be counted as it turned out later they were all identified as Republican staffers they look at him there are ties and suits they got Republican staffers written all over them anyway they literally broke into that building and and banged on the doors and windows until the people inside were physically afraid for their safety and stopped counting the votes so the Republicans they know a thing or two about mobs and orchestrating them and one additional one I mean uh you you're showing that it goes back a long time but we don't need to necessarily go back that far Heather hare was killed by a Nazi in a mob of Nazis Trump supporting white genocide conspiracy theory floatin Nazis how much concern did Chuck Grassley and and Tommy Loren have when Nazis were marching up until they did it this summer by the way again in Washington DC but they've been doing it since Trump was elected so you say hey well that's extreme right-wing okay yeah that's that's the Mafia that's what I'm worth devout right well how about Trump rallies where he kept saying punch them in the face and I'll pay your legal bills assault them and you're gonna turn around that Trump is gonna say II need a safe space cuz he's worried about riling up a crowd to commit physical assault we have him on tape saying at about 20 times and at last night's rally like we showed you the clip of him saying that they're a mob you don't give you don't give the reigns of power to a mob but I'm not sure if that quote was before or after he led yet another lock her up chant not even about Hillary Clinton any more they like doing it with Hillary Clinton but it doesn't have to be Hillary Clinton it can literally be any woman this time it was Dianne Feinstein because they think they leaked the letter about Christine Blasi Ford so lock her up lock her up they're chanting these tens of thousands of crazed people who want more women to be locked up but just quick note they want her locked up because she leaked that letter at the same time that the Trump administration is literally arguing in court that spreading hacked emails is an issue of free speech so a little bit of intellectual inconsistency there as well all right and finally now I want to go to the two funniest cases of Republicans complaining there is Dave brat who said that even his Democratic opponent in the race was part of the mob part of a quote unquote liberal mob her name is Abigail Spann burger and you should 100% support her against the Dave Brandt and this will give you a good incentive to do so so they found the tape of when brat said that she was part of an illiberal mob they were all seated no one he did anything that no one got up no hon did anything at all but she did ask a question about whether they had given too many corporate tax cuts she's asking a question about tax cuts for the rich they should be owners oh my god what a mob this is reminds me of the brandishing a chair thing yeah and so and the last ones Rand Paul look you know when use he got a six ribs broken and I I was concerned I'm like whoa that's terrible man that was like this weird why had the Republicans making a big deal out of that that's like the kind of thing that they'd be like oh my god Larr posed a tiger Republican so that we do with the crazed Muslim gay latino Democratic pub right it turned out it was in his neighbor and they've got into an argument over shrubbery literally it's still awful no it is I actually think the guy didn't you know enough of a jail sentence he only got thirty days he broke together and Paul's ribs right but it was over the brush that in between their lawns and now Rand Paul's all over TV like the mob the mob they're coming for us they're hiding in the bushes well in your case it was actually literally about the bushes like what you see click this subscribe button below and don't forget to ring the bell to never
