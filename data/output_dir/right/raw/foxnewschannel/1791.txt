1
00:00:06,444 --> 00:00:06,678

00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:08,813
MARK: HELLO, AMERICA.

6
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:13,118
I HAVE A WONDERFUL GUEST

7
00:00:13,118 --> 00:00:13,451
TONIGHT.

8
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:15,287
GARY SINISE, HOW ARE YOU, MY

9
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:15,654

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:18,356

00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:20,859
MARK: HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN FIVE,

13
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:21,226
SIX YEARS.

14
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:22,560
>> IT'S BEEN AWHILE.

15
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,995
MARK: I WANTED TO BRING YOU OUT

16
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:26,031
HERE, MEMORIAL DAY IS NOT THAT

17
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:32,170
FAR FROM NOW, AND YOU DO THIS

18
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,872
MAGNIFICENT PROGRAM EVERY YEAR

19
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:35,373
EXCEPT FOR LAST YEAR WHEN YOUR

20
00:00:35,373 --> 00:00:38,310
DAUGHTER HAD A BABY.

21
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,379
THAT IS THE NATIONAL MEMORIAL

22
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:42,147
DAY CONCERT.

23
00:00:42,147 --> 00:00:43,081
I DON'T MISS IT.

24
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,582
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS I WANT

25
00:00:44,582 --> 00:00:46,651
TO GET INTO, AND YOUR ACTING

26
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:46,985
CAREER.

27
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:48,453
TO ME, YOU ARE KIND OF UNUSUAL

28
00:00:48,453 --> 00:00:50,388
FOR HOLLYWOOD.

29
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:52,724
YOU ARE AN EXCEPTIONAL PATRIOT.

30
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:54,392
YOU ARE A SUPER PATRIOT.

31
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:56,761
YOU ARE INVOLVED IN VETERANS'

32
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:57,162
ACTIVITIES.

33
00:00:57,162 --> 00:00:58,797
YOU ARE INVOLVED IN SO MANY

34
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:00,365
VETERANS ACTIVITIES, I CAN'T

35
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:03,535
KEEP COUNT OF THEM.

36
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:04,903
WEEKEND JUST SO YOU KNOW.

37
00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:06,338
OVER THE LAST WEEKEND.

38
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:07,405
LET'S GET STARTED WITH.

39
00:01:07,405 --> 00:01:09,140
THIS FIRST OF ALL, A LITTLE BIT

40
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,275
ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND.

41
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:11,943
YOU GREW UP IN CHICAGO?

42
00:01:11,943 --> 00:01:14,512
>> YEAH, I WAS BORN ON THE

43
00:01:14,512 --> 00:01:17,015
SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO IN A TOWN

44
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:21,653
CALLED BLUE ISLAND, WHICH IS

45
00:01:21,653 --> 00:01:23,588
SOUTH SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO,

46
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:27,125
AND THEN I MOVED EVENTUALLY,

47
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:31,363
WHEN I WAS NINE, JUST AFTER THE

48
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:32,497
KENNEDY ASSASSINATION, I

49
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:34,366
REMEMBER THAT, VERY, VERY WELL,

50
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:35,967
I WAS IN ABOUT THIRD GRADE WHEN

51
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:37,035
THAT HAPPENED.

52
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:39,104
AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR 1964, WE

53
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:42,073
MOVED UP TO HIGHLAND PARK WHICH

54
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:43,475
IS A NORTHERN SUBURB OF

55
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:43,808
CHICAGO.

56
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:45,410
ABOUT 25 MILES NORTH OF

57
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,845
CHICAGO.

58
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:48,847
THAT'S WHERE I WENT TO HIGH

59
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:49,180
SCHOOL.

60
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,083
THAT'S WHERE I STARTED ACTING

61
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:52,851
IN HIGH SCHOOL PLAYS.

62
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:54,953
MARK: BEFORE YOU STARTED

63
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:58,923
ACTING, WHAT KIND OF A KID WERE

64
00:01:58,923 --> 00:01:59,224
YOU?

65
00:01:59,224 --> 00:02:01,259
>> WELL --

66
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:01,659
[LAUGHTER].

67
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:03,762
MARK: LITTLE ROUGH?

68
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:06,364
>> YEAH, I THINK -- I THINK

69
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:08,265
SOME OF THE MOVES THAT WE MADE

70
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:10,634
EARLY ON BECAUSE WE MOVED -- WE

71
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:12,303
MOVED WHEN I WAS NINE OR TEN

72
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:14,039
YEARS OLD AND MOVED AGAIN WHEN

73
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,107
I WAS IN SEVENTH GRADE, AND

74
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:17,475
MOVED AGAIN RIGHT AFTER

75
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:18,109
FRESHMAN YEAR.

76
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:21,146
THERE WERE CERTAIN MOVES I

77
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:21,446
THINK.

78
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:23,248
IT'S DISORIENTING FOR A KID TO

79
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:25,183
GET EMBEDDED WITH A CERTAIN

80
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:27,685
GROUP OF FRIENDS AND THEN GET

81
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:28,787
DISPLACED AND HAVE TO MAKE NEW

82
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:31,356
FRIENDS AND ALL OF THAT.

83
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:37,562
SO I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE.

84
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:39,531
PLUS, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN

85
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:41,066
DIAGNOSED WITH SOME SORT OF

86
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,667
LEARNING DISABILITY BACK THEN,

87
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:47,205
IF THEY KIND OF WERE DOING THAT

88
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:48,773
BECAUSE I HAD A HARD TIME

89
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:50,942
READING, I HAD A HARD TIME

90
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:53,244
WRITING, SO ACADEMICS WERE

91
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:54,546
ALWAYS A STRUGGLE FOR ME.

92
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:57,615
I WAS KIND OF A DAY DREAMER

93
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:58,550
KID, YOU KNOW?

94
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,052
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME, AND I WAS

95
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:01,553
ALWAYS DOING THAT.

96
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:02,921
I LOVED SPORTS.

97
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,789
I GOT INTO MUSIC IN FOURTH

98
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:07,158
GRADE, STARTED PLAYING GUITAR.

99
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:09,594
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DO YOU.

100
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:11,830
>> WENT RIGHT FROM HIGH SCHOOL

101
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,331
AND NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE.

102
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:13,798
>> NO.

103
00:03:13,798 --> 00:03:15,200
MARK: HOW DID YOU GO FROM HIGH

104
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,434
SCHOOL TO ACTING?

105
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:18,103
THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO.

106
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:20,004
>> I WAS PLAYING IN A ROCK BAND

107
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:21,339
AND THE DRAMA TEACHER WALKED

108
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:23,141
DOWN THE HALL AND TURNED AROUND

109
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:24,509
AND SAID I'M DIRECTING WEST

110
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:27,912
SIDE STORY, AND YOU GUYS LOOK

111
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:31,816
LIKE GANG MEMBERS, SO COME AND

112
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:32,183
AUDITION.

113
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:33,852
SO I WENT IN.

114
00:03:33,852 --> 00:03:35,920
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT LET'S SEE

115
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,455
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

116
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:39,357
I WENT TO THE AUDITION.

117
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:40,158
THERE WERE A LOT OF PRETTY

118
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:41,126
GIRLS GOING IN.

119
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:43,161
I FOLLOWED THEM IN, AND I

120
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,662
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT AN AUDITION

121
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:44,929
WAS.

122
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:47,465
THEY GAVE ME A SCRIPT AND I

123
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:49,968
STARTED STUMBLING THROUGH IT.

124
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:53,404
IT WAS FUNNY WHAT I WAS DOING,

125
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:54,706
I WAS GETTING LAUGHS AND GOT

126
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:56,074
CAST IN A PLAY.

127
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:57,175
AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE

128
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:58,643
PLAY AND THEATER, AND YOU KNOW,

129
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:00,478
I WAS STRUGGLING IN SCHOOL, SO

130
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,313
I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME IN

131
00:04:02,313 --> 00:04:03,648
SCHOOL, AND YET I FOUND THIS

132
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:05,483
THING THEY COULD DO, AND THAT I

133
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:06,751
REALLY ENJOYED DOING.

134
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:10,255
SO FROM THAT MOMENT ON, I

135
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:12,223
WANTED TO BE IN PLAYS ALL THE

136
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:12,524
TIME.

137
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:14,159
AND I AUDITIONED AND I WAS

138
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,528
PLAYING MUSIC AND GET IN THE

139
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,228
PLAYS, AND AFTER HIGH SCHOOL,

140
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,029
INCIDENTALLY I DIDN'T HAVE

141
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,398
ENOUGH CREDITS TO GRADUATE WITH

142
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:21,499
MY CLASS.

143
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:23,535
I HAD TO GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL

144
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:25,303
AND GRADUATE WITH THE FOLLOWING

145
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:27,071
CLASS BECAUSE I WASN'T DOING

146
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:29,307
WELL, BUT I WAS GOOD AT ACTING.

147
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:30,808
AND WHEN I GOT OUT OF HIGH

148
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:31,943
SCHOOL, I STARTED A THEATER

149
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:34,345
COMPANY WITH SOME OF THE KIDS

150
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:35,213
THERE.

151
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:37,382
IT'S CALLED STEPPEN WOLF

152
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:38,550
THEATER, IT'S BEEN AROUND

153
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,385
ALMOST 35 YEARS NOW.

154
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:42,287
IT'S GROWN INTO SOMETHING

155
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:43,288
THAT'S LIKE A CHICAGO

156
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:44,355
INSTITUTION, AND WE'VE BEEN ALL

157
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:46,224
OVER THE WORLD.

158
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:47,725
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS AND

159
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:51,196
IT ALL STARTED WITH KIDS, YOU

160
00:04:51,196 --> 00:04:53,364
KNOW, IN HIGHLAND PARK WHO

161
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:54,632
WANTED TO DO PLAYS.

162
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:56,267
>> WHEN WAS THE FIRST BREAK?

163
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:58,036
WHEN DID THAT COME?

164
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:01,406
>> YOU KNOW, IT DEPENDS.

165
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:04,108
THERE WERE A SERIES OF THEM.

166
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:06,377
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KIND OF

167
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:11,849
HELPED TO MOVE STEPPENWOLF

168
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:14,686
THEATRE FROM A LOCAL,

169
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:15,420
CHICAGO--BASED COMPANY, THAT

170
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,388
WAS ONLY KNOWN THERE TO A

171
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:18,623
NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED COMPANY

172
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:21,192
IS WHEN WE MOVED ONE OF OUR

173
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:23,361
PLAYS FROM CHICAGO TO NEW YORK,

174
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:27,699
AND WE DID IT OFF BROADWAY.

175
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:34,005
JOHN MAL KWICH WAS IN IT, WE

176
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:37,542
DID IT FOR SIX MONTHS, ALL OF A

177
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:40,378
SUDDEN STEPPENWOLF WENT FROM A

178
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:41,179
LOCAL THEATER TO

00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:42,013
INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED

00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:43,481
THEATER, WHEN YOU GO TO NO, YOU

PUBLICATION, ALL OF A SUDDEN WE

185
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:52,457
WENT FROM SOMETHING SMALL TO

186
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:55,493
SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT BIGGER,

187
00:05:55,493 --> 00:05:56,928
AND I WAS RECOGNIZED AS

188
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:59,797
SOMEBODY WHO CAN DIRECT AND --

189
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:04,602
YOU KNOW, THAT STARTED THE NEXT

00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:08,006
BUT THEN I WENT OUT TO

191
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:08,406
CALIFORNIA.

192
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:09,641
MARK: AND THE REST IS HISTORY.

193
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:12,877
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS.

194
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:14,846
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS IS A

195
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:15,513
FAIR QUESTION.

196
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:16,814
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE

197
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:18,016
THAT YOU WERE IN?

198
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:21,986
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR MAIN

199
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:23,655
MOVIES, BUT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

200
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:25,223
FOR YOU, THE MOST CHALLENGING

201
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:28,493
ROLE, THE MOST FULFILLING ROLE.

202
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:33,398
>> WELL, FULFILLING, THERE'S A

203
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:34,632
BUNCH OF THEM.

204
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:36,234
MARK: I'LL GIVE YOU MINE, ONE

205
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:36,601
OF MINE.

206
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:37,302
>> OKAY.

207
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:39,771
MARK: AND THIS IS ALMOST

208
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:41,572
COUNTERINTUITIVE BECAUSE YOU

209
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:43,274
KNOW I'M PRO COP.

210
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:43,608
RANSOM.

211
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:44,809
YOU SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME

212
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:46,044
IN THAT MOVIE.

213
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:47,045
>> THE COP RUN AMOK.

214
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:49,914
MARK: THAT WAS A SCARY MOVIE.

215
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:52,917
>> AND TA WAS A GOOD ONE, IT

216
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,585
WAS REALLY, REALLY WELL

217
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:56,587
DIRECTED BY RON HOWARD, VERY

218
00:06:56,587 --> 00:06:57,655
TENSE THRILLER.

219
00:06:57,655 --> 00:06:59,524
I ORIGINALLY DID NOT WANT TO

220
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:00,191
PLAY THAT PART.

221
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:02,894
RON ASKED ME TO DO IT, AND I

222
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:04,395
JUST COULDN'T SEE MYSELF DOING

223
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:04,696
IT.

224
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:06,197
I HAD SMALL CHILDREN, IT'S

225
00:07:06,197 --> 00:07:08,366
ABOUT A GUY WHO TAKES A CHILD,

226
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:09,834
AND I JUST HATED THE CHARACTER

227
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:12,270
WHEN I READ, IT SO I PASSED ON

228
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,571
IT AND IT CAME AROUND AGAIN AND

229
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:15,873
I TOOK IT, AND THEN IT WAS FUN

230
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:19,377
TO BE EVIL, FUN TO BE THE BAD

231
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:19,677
GUY.

232
00:07:19,677 --> 00:07:20,545
OF COURSE, I GET PAID BACK IN

233
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:22,647
THE END OF THE MOVIE.

234
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:25,416
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE CERTAINLY.

235
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,386
FORREST GUMP WAS A LIFE

236
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:30,221
CHANGING FILM IN MANY WAYS.

237
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:31,456
VETERANS WORK, AND I HADN'T

238
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:34,826
DONE MANY MOVIES WHEN I DID

239
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:35,126
THAT.

240
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:37,061
MARK: YOU HIT A POINT RIGHT

241
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:37,362
THERE.

242
00:07:37,362 --> 00:07:39,664
YOU ARE SO ACTIVE NOW IN THE

243
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:43,334
VETERANS MOVEMENT, BUT NOT JUST

244
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:46,537
THAT, POLICE, FIREFIGHTERS,

245
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:47,638
PUBLIC SAFETY.

246
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,073
FORREST GUMP REALLY WAS A

247
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:51,642
TURNING POINT FOR YOU IN THAT

248
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:52,410
RESPECT, WASN'T IT?

249
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,947
>> WELL, IT WAS SOMETHING THAT

250
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:58,549
LED ME TO BEGIN TO SUPPORT OUR

251
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:00,318
WOUNDED VETERANS, BECAUSE I WAS

252
00:08:00,318 --> 00:08:02,687
PLAYING THE WOUNDED VETERAN.

253
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:03,554
PRIOR TO THAT, I HAD BEEN

254
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:05,423
SUPPORTING VIETNAM VETERANS,

255
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:07,191
GOING BACK TO THE 80s VIETNAM

256
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:08,793
VETERANS MY FAMILY, I GOT

257
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:10,695
INVOLVED WITH VIETNAM VETERANS

258
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:12,563
IN THE MID 80s IN THE CHICAGO

259
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:15,333
AREA SUPPORTING THEM LOCALLY.

260
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,668
THIS WAS AT A TIME THAT WAS

261
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:19,937
VERY DIFFICULT FOR OUR VIETNAM

262
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:20,304
VETERANS.

263
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:23,007
WALL WAS PUT UP IN 1982.

264
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,176
WE STARTED TO HAVE WELCOME HOME

265
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:26,878
PARADES AND THINGS LIKE THAT

266
00:08:26,878 --> 00:08:30,615
AROUND 1984 AND 85 BUT VIETNAM

267
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:32,150
VETERANS WERE LIVING IN THE

268
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,751
SHADOWS, THEY WERE STILL

269
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:34,152
STRUGGLING.

270
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:35,653
THEY WERE STILL HAVING

271
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:37,355
DIFFICULTY AND I STARTED TO

272
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:38,890
SUPPORT THEM LOCALLY IN

273
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,357
CHICAGO, AND IN THE 90s I GOT

274
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:41,626
TO PLAY THE VIETNAM VETERAN,

275
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:44,429
AND HE WAS A WOUNDED SOLDIER

276
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:47,098
AND I GOT TO START WORKING WITH

277
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:49,667
THE DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS

278
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,336
ASSOCIATION IN '94.

279
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:54,238
SO FORREST GUMP WAS CERTAINLY A

280
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:55,339
VERY, VERY GOOD ROLE TO PLAY IN

281
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:56,140
MANY WAYS.

282
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,076
IF YOU ASK ME AGAIN WHAT SOME

283
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:00,711
OF THE MOST CHALLENGING STUFF?

284
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:02,580
I PLAY THE GOVERNOR OF ALABAMA,

285
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,716
GEORGE WALLACE IN A TNT

286
00:09:05,716 --> 00:09:07,084
TELEVISION FILM DIRECTED BY

287
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:11,556
JOHN FRANKENHARMER IN 1997 AND

288
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:14,058
THAT WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST

289
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:17,895
ROLE THEY HAD DONE, CERTAINLY

290
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:20,164
PROBABLY TO DATE.

291
00:09:20,164 --> 00:09:22,667
IT WAS AN OVER THREE-HOUR,

292
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,936
TWO-NIGHT MINI-SERIES AND TOOK

293
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:26,971
ABOUT 20 YEARS OF HIS LIFE.

294
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:28,906
ANGELINA WAS A YOUNG ACTRESS AT

295
00:09:28,906 --> 00:09:29,574
THAT TIME.

296
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:32,276
SHE WAS 21.

297
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:32,743
ANGELINA JOLIE.

298
00:09:32,743 --> 00:09:34,178
MARK: YOU REMEMBER THAT ROLE.

299
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:37,782
>> NOBODY KNEW WHO SHE WAS.

300
00:09:37,782 --> 00:09:38,816
MARK: YOU REMEMBER THAT ROLE

301
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:39,116
WHY.

302
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:40,685
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT ROLE?

303
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:42,353
>> GEORGE WALLACE?

304
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:44,021
I THINK I WAS IN EVERY SINGLE

305
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:45,289
FRAME OF THE MOVIE.

306
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:48,292
IT WAS CALLED GEORGE WALLACE

307
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:49,794
AND I WAS PLAYING GEORGE

308
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:50,127
WALLACE.

309
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:51,295
AND FORREST GUMP, FOR EXAMPLE,

310
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:53,898
I'M IN THE MOVIE FOR MAYBE 20

311
00:09:53,898 --> 00:09:56,167
MINUTES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

312
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,602
THERE'S MAYBE 25 MINUTES,

313
00:09:57,602 --> 00:09:59,537
THERE'S FOUR OR FIVE SEGMENTS

314
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:01,072
THAT ARE LIEUTENANT DAN, BUT

315
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:03,975
THERE'S A BIG, BIG STORY OF ALL

316
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:06,310
THESE OTHER PEOPLE IN FORREST

317
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,644
GUMP.

318
00:10:06,644 --> 00:10:09,380
GEORGE WALLACE AND HARRY

319
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,948
TRUMAN, I PLAYED HARRY TRUMAN

320
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:13,451
AS WELL IN AN HBO MOVIE.

321
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:15,052
THOSE MOVIES WERE FOCUSED ON

322
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:16,687
THAT CHARACTER AND I HAD TO

323
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:18,890
CARRY THOSE FILMS IN A WAY THAT

324
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,958
A SUPPORTING CHARACTER LIKE

325
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,561
LIEUTENANT DAN OR EVEN RANSOM,

326
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:25,429
DOES NOT HAVE TO DO.

327
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:27,231
RANSOM WAS STARRING MEL GIBSON.

328
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:29,400
HE WAS CARRYING THE MOVIE.

329
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,336
BOTH TRUMAN AND WALLACE WERE

330
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:34,272
MOVIES THAT RELIED HEAVILY ON

331
00:10:34,272 --> 00:10:36,774
PERFORMANCE AND I HAD TO REALLY

332
00:10:36,774 --> 00:10:37,275
STEP UP.

333
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:40,278
MARK: AND YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH

334
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:43,981
MOVED ON TO WHAT IS YOUR

335
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:46,350
PASSION, THE TROOPS, THE

336
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,519
POLICE, THE FIREFIGHTERS, THE

337
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:48,819
VETS.

338
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:50,855
BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT, DOES

339
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:52,590
THAT MEAN YOU'RE FOREVER

340
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,157
ABANDONING ACTING?

341
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:56,093
>> NO, NO, I CAN'T SAY THAT.

342
00:10:56,093 --> 00:11:00,064
I'M GOING TO DO A SMALL PART

343
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:02,667
THIS SUMMER IN A FILM THAT

344
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,835
DIRECTORED WANTED ME TO DO,

345
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,803
VERY SMALL PART.

346
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:07,238
BUT IT'S IN HAWAII.

347
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:08,873
MARK: DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER PART?

348
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:10,408
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

349
00:11:10,408 --> 00:11:13,444
BUT YOUR REAL FOCUS NOW IS ON

350
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:15,479
THE OTHER, CORRECT?

351
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,114
>> YES.

352
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:17,415
YEAH.

353
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:20,017
MARK: AND YOU -- IS THAT A

354
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:21,786
DETERMINATION YOU MADE OR THIS

355
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:23,054
JUST CAME ABOUT OR SOME POINT

356
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:25,056
OF YOUR LIFE YOU SAID I REALLY

357
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:27,058
WANT TO FOCUS ON MY

358
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:27,892
FOUNDATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SO

359
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:30,261
FORTH AND SO ON AND CAN DO A

360
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:32,897
LITTLE BIT OF ACTING BUT CAN'T

361
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:34,799
DO A WHOLE LOT OF BOTH?

362
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,701
>> WELL, THERE'S A BLESSING

363
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:38,235
THAT I'VE HAD WHICH IS SOME

364
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:40,004
SUCCESS IN THE MOVIE BUSINESS

365
00:11:40,004 --> 00:11:41,706
AND TELEVISION BUSINESS.

366
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:43,507
I WAS ON TELEVISION ON TWO

367
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:45,076
TELEVISION SERIES, ONE FOR NINE

368
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:46,777
YEARS, THE OTHER FOR TWO YEARS,

369
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:48,980
THAT'S 11 YEARS ON TELEVISION,

370
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,482
AND THAT PUT ME IN A DIFFERENT

371
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:54,719
PLACE IN TERMS OF WHAT I COULD

372
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:57,121
DO BOTH FINANCIALLY TO SUPPORT

373
00:11:57,121 --> 00:11:59,357
OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM,

374
00:11:59,357 --> 00:12:00,391
AND TIMEWISE.

375
00:12:00,391 --> 00:12:03,561
I CAN AFFORD TO TAKE THAT TIME

376
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:05,796
TO GO OUT AND DO THESE TYPES OF

377
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:08,065
THINGS, BECAUSE I OWNED A PIECE

378
00:12:08,065 --> 00:12:08,532
OF THAT SHOW.

379
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:11,035
CSI NEW YORK, SO I DID WELL ON

380
00:12:11,035 --> 00:12:11,369
IT.

381
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:13,437
AND IT CAME AT A TIME WHERE I

382
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:17,642
WAS JUST -- IT WAS POST

383
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:18,676
SEPTEMBER 11TH AND I STARTED TO

384
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:20,711
RAMP UP ACTIVITIES IN TERMS OF

385
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:22,413
HOW I COULD SUPPORT THE MEN AND

386
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:24,048
WOMEN DEPLOYING TO AFGHANISTAN

387
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:25,416
AND IRAQ AND WHAT I WANTED TO

388
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,751
DO TO HELP THEM THROUGH THE

389
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,819
DIFFICULT TIMES, AND THINGS

390
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:31,288
JUST GOT HARDER AND HARDER FOR

391
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:33,591
THEM, AS THE CONFLICT IN IRAQ

392
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:36,994
TOOK A TURN, YOU KNOW.

393
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:37,962
NOT IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE

394
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:38,863
WANTED IT TO.

395
00:12:38,863 --> 00:12:40,231
OUR MEN AND WOMEN WERE CAUGHT

396
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:42,299
IN THERE AND THEY NEEDED SOME

397
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,234
SUPPORT, AND I WANTED TO MAKE

398
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:45,336
SURE THEY GOT THE SUPPORT THEY

399
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:46,771
NEEDED, UNLIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO

400
00:12:46,771 --> 00:12:48,372
OUR VIETNAM VETERANS WHEN THEY

401
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:51,442
GOT CAUGHT IN THE POLITICAL

402
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:53,811
MUCK OF THAT PARTICULAR

403
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:55,513
CONFLICT, AND THEY SUFFERED.

404
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,214
AND HAVING VIETNAM VETERANS IN

405
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:59,817
MY FAMILY AND HAVING BEEN

406
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:00,584
INVOLVED WITH VIETNAM VETERANS

407
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:01,919
OVER THE YEARS, I DID NOT WANT

408
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,955
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN TO THIS

409
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:07,491
POST-9/11 GENERATION OF

410
00:13:07,491 --> 00:13:08,859
WARRIOR, GOING OVER IN REACTION

411
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:09,894
TO WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT

412
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:11,829
TERRIBLE DAY.

413
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:12,763
I WANTED TO SUPPORT THEM WITH

414
00:13:12,763 --> 00:00:00,000
EVERYTHING I HAD, AND TURNED
