00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
happy Monday everyone this video comes

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,970
in six parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've written them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,859
partly because I plan ahead and also

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:05,970
because I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more like I'm a</font>

5
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,589
stone and easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fair that's my</font>

6
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,120
general goal in night but let us move

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,280
swiftly onwards part<font color="#CCCCCC"> one hair you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

8
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,509
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> noticed that my hair is somewhat</font>

9
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,370
pink<font color="#E5E5E5"> that drive to dye my hair pink goes</font>

10
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,500
back to both about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> week ago when I was</font>

11
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,240
like standing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Boots and surrounded by</font>

12
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,949
hair dyes but also goes back to my early

13
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,990
childhood years massive fan of no doubt

14
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,550
obsessed with Gwen Stefani I was

15
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,930
obsessed with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> album cover of return</font>

16
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,460
of satin I actually have that CD but

17
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,869
it's buried way back in my bookshelf

18
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,369
where all the other foreign objects live

19
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:30,750
anyway so it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna sort out my</font>

20
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,159
route so then I saw this died and I was

21
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,230
like why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's bleach London the big</font>

22
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,360
pink is 210 washes and it's been like

23
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,100
fading with everyone is very Gordon's

24
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,600
right now which I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite like a</font>

25
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,469
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people saying it's very</font>

26
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,120
Clementine from eternal sunshine of the

27
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,800
spotless mind which I kind of love and

28
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,120
also that<font color="#E5E5E5"> reminds them of my so-called</font>

29
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,250
life part-2 bras so I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very</font>

30
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,690
well over the last few days in one of

31
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">those days in the mood of the night I</font>

32
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,750
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wrote this delirious post about</font>

33
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,879
bras and boobs how are they really like

34
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,350
wearing bras the waiting to meet though

35
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,850
is that I feel so self-conscious about

36
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">not wearing a bra on camera when I'm</font>

37
00:00:58,649 --> 00:00:59,910
making these videos I think that's

38
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,649
partly because as I said in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the post the</font>

39
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,180
visual medium is very productive<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

40
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,140
that affects a lot the way the content

41
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">is see all these problems with the male</font>

42
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,990
gaze and all that sort of stuff the

43
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,520
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of it is also naturally a</font>

44
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,590
fear of like sexual harassment and and

45
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,049
decide that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sexual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sexualization</font>

46
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,090
that you don't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you</font>

47
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,619
wanted some situations but you don't

48
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,000
want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in other situations the thing</font>

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
that frustrated me Percy like entire me

50
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,270
was that I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great audience</font>

51
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,159
and I don't have the number of problems

52
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,990
on the scale that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had before with</font>

53
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,580
regards to harassment and things and

54
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,720

56
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,570

helpers you guys always do so it's just

58
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bit like what is my issue this is such</font>

59
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,820
a tumble answer to give but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

62
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,350
something I can fix all I can do is

63
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,299
personally for myself this is my

64
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my decision not to have to wear</font>
