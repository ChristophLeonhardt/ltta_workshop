PIPA legislation is but if you don't you

a while now but it was only<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently</font>

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,540
that it gained the attention of the

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,330
masses and why because people thought oh

10
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,400
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> could actually pass Facebook</font>

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,250

websites our love could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in danger but</font>

13
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,720
once again the vote has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been postponed</font>

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,090
and what I hope doesn't happen is people

15
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,920
just think oh cool back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> null</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font>

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,390
can't whistle by the way apathy is one

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,129
of the biggest problems in society but

18
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">is there any surprise it exists when you</font>

19
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,000
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in Congress trying to pass</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it like this and it doesn't matter if</font>

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,360
they keep postponing the vote we want it

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,420
killed off completely we want people

23
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,090
representing our countries that go that

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,949
was a stupid idea what the hell were we

25
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,070
thinking not oh oh oh look look at this

26
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,649
lovely money look at this lovely money

27
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,350
for me these legislations are ridiculous

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,059
but let's start things simple though

29
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,920
with some analogies it's like saying

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,020
it's almost caught<font color="#E5E5E5"> photocopying a book</font>

31
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,549
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the library we should shut the</font>

32
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,380
library down or if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to a</font>

33
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,939
library with a book of their choosing

34
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,640
and placed it on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shelf they had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,350
permission from the author to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

36
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,450
they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just close down the library</font>

37
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,159
yeah that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great idea it's like</font>

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,600
saying a song was attacked by a shark

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,430
when swimming because it does

40
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,740
occasionally happen and the US

41
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,960
government's like oh yeah yeah we can't

42
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,270
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again let's spend loads</font>

43
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,119
of our time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> resources on finding a</font>

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,610
way to electrify the ocean that'll stop

45
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharks with their agendas but yeah</font>

46
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,810
sure people like to swim in the ocean

47
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,060
but we can't have shark attacks can we

48
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,470
it's like a wrestling a student because

49
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">their final dissertation contains some</font>

50
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,340
content we call that research that

51
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,200
wasn't theirs even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though they cited it</font>

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,670
even though they put a reference of

53
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">where they got the content from even</font>

54
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,670
though that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole point in</font>

55
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,409
research building on other people's

56
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,530
theories and aiding progress in society

57
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,540
it's like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> government initiative to</font>

58
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,630
stop murder from happening by blowing up

59
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">the world and making it uninhabitable</font>

60
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,910
that's is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> genius idea it's like saying</font>

61
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,400
because some drunk gets into his car<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

62
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,740
crashes it on the way home<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

63
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,890
woman should close down the brewer who

64
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,200
made the drink the car<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufacturer that</font>

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,930
made the car that he crashed and closing

66
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,850
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the road that he used and crashed</font>

67
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,280
on or the sidewalk if he<font color="#CCCCCC"> crashed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

68
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,530
sidewalk don't know the situation to be

69
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,880
honest it's like stopping son from

70
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,190
decorating their kids birthday cake with

71
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,500
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite cartoon character because</font>

72
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,030
they don't own the rights to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> image</font>

73
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,610
oh wait that did actually happen it's

74
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,800
like making seed sterile because some

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,420
farmers took the initiative to share

76
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,670
their fertile seeds for free and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

77
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,440
also true it's like if a<font color="#E5E5E5"> member of</font>

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,870
government let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lamar</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> legislation what you believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in is</font>

86
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,490
the money<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you probably got from</font>

87
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,350
lobbyists it's been said by many that if

88
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,330
you can't handle pirates don't get in

89
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,740
the water and that's the whole point

90
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,870
really isn't it the companies that

91
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">support site / legislation are those</font>

92
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,920
that haven't evolved with the times

93
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,600
they've been losing all this money to

94
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,860
party but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's because they haven't</font>

adapted Rupert Murdoch tweeted the other

96
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,670
day don't care about people not buying

97
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,130
movies programs or newspapers just

98
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,350
stealing them what does he<font color="#CCCCCC"> think people</font>

99
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,150
are stealing these papers now yeah okay

100
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,350
that was a third of what he said but

101
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,970
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take newspapers the main</font>

102
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,920
reason most people don't pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for new</font>

103
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,260
subscriptions online is because they can

104
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,180
get it elsewhere legally for free and

105
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,130
that's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> competition so deal with</font>

106
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,840
it just look at stuff like Netflix

107
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,750
Spotify ad sponsored<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube content and</font>

108

project pledge websites these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

109
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,260
great examples of how you deal with

110
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,690
online piracy what is not a solution is

111
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,060
restrictive policy from government<font color="#CCCCCC"> soso</font>

112
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">/</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means silence in Greek and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's quite</font>

113
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,630
fitting with how government try to sneak

114
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,790
it under the radar and SOPA mean sweep

115
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,710
in Swedish which is what the government

116
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">keeps saying they're doing sweeping it</font>

117
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,130
aside but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's gone</font>

118
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,050
away completely the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> will try</font>

119
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and pass it when you least suspect it</font>

120
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,860
just like they did with the NDAA on New

121
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,970
Year's Eve and I know what you're

122
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,560
thinking why am I<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting involved with</font>

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,600
American politics why don't I mind my

124
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,279
own business because believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or not</font>

125
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,108
some of the actions the US government

126
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,180
takes affects everyone in the world and

127
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,560
I know there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some very patriotic</font>

128
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,570
Americans out there

129
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,550
who want the awesomeness of<font color="#E5E5E5"> USA to be</font>

130
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,380
heard in every country in the world but

131
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,610
if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that you have to</font>

132
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,470
be fair and acknowledge the not so

133
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,150
awesome parts about your country as well

134
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">soper affects everyone with the internet</font>

135
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,010
and in some cases it feels like the u.s.

136
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,360
is trying to police the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world i mean</font>

137
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">what next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be driving out my</font>

138
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,800
street and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get extradited to the</font>

139
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,900
US for driving on the wrong side of the

140
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,020
road one of the best things that's ever

141
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened to me in my life is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

142
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,470
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and YouTube for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that matter</font>

143
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,540
it's allowed me to express myself freely

144
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,400
connect with people from many different

145
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,470
backgrounds from all over the world and

146
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">most importantly it's allowed me to</font>

147
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,520
become a better person the<font color="#CCCCCC"> establishment</font>

148
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,470
really doesn't like losing control and

149
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,510
therefore we must ensure legislations

150
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,400
like SOPA and PIPA whatever they're

151
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,890
labeled are not passed because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> worst</font>

152
00:05:12,890 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing about censorship is</font>
