the un-backed joint mission investigating the chemical attack in Syria's idli province back in April has found government forces to be responsible the watchdog says they have looked into various scenarios question hundreds of witnesses and examined thousands of pictures and files however they did stress they never made it to the site of the attack the leadership panel has identified ISIL had responsible for the use of sulfur mustard in harsh and the Syrian Arab Republic that responsible for the use of sarin at khan shaykhun the study showed that the samples from hansha Kuna match with a particular chemical from the Syrian Arab Republic stockpile that is required to make sarin all right Archie correspondent Kayla Maupin has got more on the story and joins us live now Caleb thanks for being with us so and tell us the details of what was said during that meeting well after we heard from the report of the OPCW after that we heard from nikki Haley the UN ambassador of the United States now she escalated her rhetoric against the Syrian Arab Republic and seemed to be rallying the council to prolong the work of the joint investigative mechanism this is nikki Haley the Jemez report not only identifies those behind the chemical attacks it also explains how it reached its conclusion it lays out in great detail how the team carried out this challenging investigation and just as any independent team of experts would it makes note of any irregularities it found in the information obtained from the investigation now the Russian ambassador was quite critical the report and laid out before the council how many ways in which the OPCW can convey many ways in which the OPCW conducted their investigation were unsatisfactory he went into a lot of detail this is what he had to say specialist the meatiest many investigators carried out their work remotely the report is full of omissions inconsistencies and discrepancy he's a very mediocre quality there is a question as to the samples collected by third parties and whether they are from Syria at all it is unclear how the sarin was transported and used also a visit to sharat airbase would be crucial to prove if sarin was there and to find out who is responsible for the attack in other words it was the gyms task to find this out now the Russian envoi pointed out that at no point did the OPCW team actually visit the site of the chemical attack in Kahn Sheikh kun he urged the world to imagine a criminal investigation in which the scene of the crime was never visited by the investigators now from there he also went on to point out that the third parties that were relied upon by the OPCW some of the sources were a little bit less than credible for example the white helmets who are known to have links to the al-nusra terrorist group were cited and uses a source in the report now the United States has said that it's open to negotiating a possible future UN Security Council resolution regarding Syria and we have heard from the European Union the European Union is saying it wants new sanctions against the Syrian Arab Republic in response to the opcw's report presented at the council all right our teen caleb mopping it there for us keeping across this story now as more information becomes available I know that you're gonna stay across it for us thanks for being with us now amidst all this we have spoken to an expert who believes that the report is based on fundamental mistakes and flaws take a look let me give you an example they have this crater the crater is allegedly where a according according to claims a Russian designed chemical bomb was dropped and and a sarin release occurred from it now if you drop a bomb that is designed to release chemicals you will find around the area where the release occurred large pieces of the bomb this is not an explosive bomb it doesn't it doesn't detonate and create many Eggman's it's almost it's a canister that is filled with a chemical that's a liquid that has looks a lot like water and behaves a lot like water and it's got a small explosive charge in it and the explosive charge ruptures the canister so that the material will fall out on the ground now any place where this kind of munition is used is gone the remnants of the munition will be there I to further discuss this situation we're joined live now by Ivan Eiland US defense analyst and author Ivan thanks for being with us here on Rt international so interesting developments the report was released before just being discussed now by the United Nations how do you view the findings of the investigation well of course you're investigating something on an active battlefield so it's not always you know possible to visit the site and of course as your report pointed out visiting the site like a criminal investigation is a big a big help and investigations like this it doesn't mean that it's impossible to find out you know who did this but it sort of is is a problem I think so you bring up a good point about you know an active battlefield in fact Russia's deputy envoy to the United Nations has drawn attention to several examples of why the results may be faulty why do you think that these examples were not considered during the investigation well I mean I have to I haven't seen the details of his his critique he says that there's a missions etc and I would have to see the the you know his specific critique of this but I will say that both sides this has been a nasty mean conflict on both sides and I don't think either side is blameless however chemical weapons don't really kill that many people on the battlefield now you can make an argument that it's a prohibited way of warfare and it's indiscriminant but so our you know bombs and bullets and that sort of thing so many civilians have been killed in this war by both sides I on purpose and I think the the the terrorists in Syria the terror groups have used sulfur mustard which is a more primitive gas and sarin so I think there was enough blame to go around on all sides and certainly no one is blameless in the world or the theatres of war that's for sure one of Russia's main points is the fact that they didn't actually go to the site to investigate the site specifically itself making a lot of their evidence hearsay or the equivalent thereof what do you make of that well I like I said it would be better if they had that that evidence because I think you know with you're going to examine things you need to look at the residue the ground etc around this where this was allegedly dropped since it's a chemical substance so I think it's you know it's a problem now whether it nullifies the investigation that's another matter for the technical experts to to you know sort out I think there is some hope that the United States is saying hey we we could have another you know some sort of a negotiation on the entire Syrian matter I'm not sure sanctions against anybody are going to do much good other than symbolism and of course the EU is always very big on symbolism but I'm not sure you know the sanctions are that they're proposing are the way to go I think if there there should be a way to solve this whole problem and prevent all sorts of death with whether it's from chemical weapons or just bombs and bullets which have killed far more people on the battlefield probably ninety percent the ten percent versus chemical weapon so I think you know that's that's the way to go instead of you know you know blaming every one side or the other here all right very interesting to hear your thoughts hopefully there is some hope on the negotiation run between the US and Russia I have an eland us the defense analyst and off they're always interesting to hear your thoughts thanks for being with us here on Rt International
