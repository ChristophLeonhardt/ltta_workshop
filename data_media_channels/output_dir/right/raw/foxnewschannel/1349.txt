1
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:14,085
>> IF YOU ARE SMUGGLING A CHILD

2
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:15,252
THEN WE WILL PROSECUTE YOU.

3
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:17,521
AND THAT CHILD MAY BE SEPARATED

4
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:20,858
FROM YOU AS REQUIRED BY LAW.

5
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:23,594
WE DON’T WANT TO SEPARATE

6
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:25,329
FAMILIES, BUT WE DON’T WANT

7
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:28,499
FAMILIES TO COME TO THE BORDER

8
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:28,866
ILLEGALLY.

9
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:31,235
>> EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY

10
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:31,869
IN THIS COUNTRY SEPARATES

11
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:34,472
PARENTS AND CHILDREN WHEN THEY

12
00:00:34,472 --> 00:00:36,307
ARE ARRESTED FOR A CRIME.

13
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:39,444
THIS IS NO NEW POLICY.

14
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:40,879
>> THERE IS NO BIPARTISAN

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,016
SUPPORT FOR CHANGING THAT.

16
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:46,451
>> IMMIGRATION SPECIFICALLY

17
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:48,620
ABOUT IMMIGRANT CHILDREN.

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,723
1500 OF THEM, THE HEADLINE SAID

19
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:54,259
HAD BEEN LOST UNDER THE TRUMP

20
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:54,959
ADMINISTRATION’S ADHERENCE TO

21
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,027
THIS POLICY.

22
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:58,063
HHS PUT OUT A STATEMENT REFUTING

23
00:00:58,063 --> 00:01:01,867
THAT, SAYING THE ASSERTION THAT

24
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:03,502
UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN CHILDREN ARE

25
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:05,269
LOST IS COMPLETELY FALSE.

26
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,104
THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT LOST,

27
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:08,573
THEIR SPONSORS ARE USUALLY

28
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:11,743
FAMILY MEMBERS AND THEY HAVE

29
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:13,345
BEEN VETTED IN CRIMINALITY AND

30
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:15,147
THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR THEM

31
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:17,482
AND COULD NOT BE REACHED BY THE

32
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:19,284
VOLUNTARY WOULD CALL WAS MADE.

33
00:01:19,284 --> 00:01:21,086
IN MANY CASES SPONSORS CANNOT BE

34
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:22,120
REACHED BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES

35
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,088
ARE ILLEGAL ALIENS AND DO NOT

36
00:01:23,088 --> 00:01:25,924
WANT TO BE REACHED BY FEDERAL

37
00:01:25,924 --> 00:01:27,092
AUTHORITIES.

38
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:29,261
SO, WHAT ABOUT THIS ISSUE

39
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:30,095
SPECIFICALLY ON WHERE

40
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:31,230
IMMIGRATION STANDS CURRENTLY, SO

41
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,435
LET’S BRING IN THE PANEL.

42
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:40,472
AND IT STEVE HAYES, EDITOR AND

43
00:01:40,472 --> 00:01:41,540
CHIEF AND MATT SCHLAPP,

44
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,243
CONTRIBUTOR WITH THE HILL.

45
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:45,644
MARA, THIS GOT LOTS OF

46
00:01:45,644 --> 00:01:46,045
ATTENTION.

47
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:47,947
>> IT HAS A LOT OF ATTENTION AND

48
00:01:47,947 --> 00:01:50,649
HAS A LOT OF PARTS TO IT.

49
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:51,984
ON ONE HAND, THESE CHILDREN

50
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:53,319
BEING LOST IS NOT TRUE.

51
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,456
ON THE OTHER HAND, AS YOU JUST

52
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:58,191
HEARD THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

53
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:59,892
MADE VERY CLEAR IT WANTED TO

54
00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:01,394
CONTINUE THAT BECAUSE IT’S A

55
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:01,761
DETERRENT.

56
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:03,196
DON’T BRING YOUR KIDS HERE

57
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:04,730
ILLEGALLY BECAUSE YOU WILL GET

58
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:11,738
SEPARATED FROM THEM.

59
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:12,605
THEY DECIDED THEY WANTED TO

60
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:13,906
BLAME IT ON DEMOCRATS EVEN

61
00:02:13,906 --> 00:02:16,142
THOUGH THAT WAS A POLICY THAT

62
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:19,479
THEY CARRY THROUGH.

63
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,114
>> Bret: BUT, STEVE, THE

64
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:22,048
CHARACTERIZATION OF IT THEY

65
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:24,451
DEPEND ON WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING

66
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:25,485
OR READING.

67
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:26,953
OR, THE POLICY WENT BACK A

68
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:29,322
COUPLE OF ADMINISTRATIONS.

69
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:30,724
>> IF THAT’S TRUE BUT THIS

70
00:02:30,724 --> 00:02:32,492
REALLY TOOK OFF OVER THE WEEKEND

71
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:34,728
WHEN YOU HAD A FORMER OBAMA

72
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:35,562
SPEECHWRITER JON FAVREAU AND

73
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:38,665
OTHERS PUTTING THIS OUT THERE,

74
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:39,432
PUTTING UP PICTURES OF CHILDREN

75
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:44,304
IN CAGES AND IT WAS OUTRAGEOUS.

76
00:02:44,304 --> 00:02:45,872
BECAUSE IT WAS THE TRUMP

77
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:46,506
ADMINISTRATION DOING THIS,

78
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:47,908
FAILING TO NOTE THAT THIS HAD

79
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:50,343
HAPPENED AS YOU SAY UNDER

80
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:51,345
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.

81
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:53,680
SO THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK

82
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,082
THAT POURED FUEL ON THIS

83
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:57,684
PROVERBIAL FIRE, IF YOU WILL.

84
00:02:57,684 --> 00:02:59,019
THERE’S NO QUESTION THAT THE

85
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:00,387
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING

86
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:02,790
TO TAKE A TOUGH STAND ON ILLEGAL

87
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,791
BORDER CROSSINGS WHICH ARE UP

88
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,261
AFTER INITIALLY GOING DOWN AT

89
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:08,429
THE BEGINNING OF THE TRUMP

90
00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:09,863
ADMINISTRATION BY SAYING THIS,

91
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:12,600
AND MAKING THIS PART OF THEIR

92
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:12,933
POLICY.

93
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:14,835
WE SAW WITH THE POWER OF

94
00:03:14,835 --> 00:03:15,703
PRESIDENTIAL RHETORIC AND THE

95
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:18,272
POWER OF ADMINISTRATION RHETORIC

96
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:19,506
DID TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF

97
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:20,908
PEOPLE TRYING TO COME ACROSS THE

98
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:21,242
BORDER.

99
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,110
I THINK THAT IS THEIR GOAL HERE

100
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,545
AND WE COULD DEBATE WHETHER THIS

101
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:27,281
IS THE RIGHT POLICY OR NOT.

102
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,817
THEY HAVE SAID, BOTH JOHN KELLY

103
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:31,886
AND CHIEF OF STAFF WHO JUST

104
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:32,753
PLAYED, THEY MADE CLEAR THAT

105
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:35,456
THEY VIEW THIS AS AN EFFECTIVE

106
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:35,823
DETERRENT.

107
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:36,657
>> Bret: I ALWAYS SAY THE

108
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:38,326
DISCLAIMER OR I TRY TO COME UP

109
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:40,495
YOUR WIFE WORKS FOR THIS

110
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:41,262
ADMINISTRATION.

111
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,198
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE THOUGHT

112
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:47,668
PROCESS IS, BEHIND OF THIS MOVE?

113
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,737
ARE THEY PUSHING BACK BEHIND THE

114
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:50,872
BAD NEWS STORIES ON THIS OR IS

115
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:52,807
THAT A STRATEGY HERE THAT’S

116
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:57,078
DEVELOPING ON THE IMMIGRATION?

117
00:03:57,078 --> 00:04:01,316
>> BRETT, BE CAREFUL GETTING

118
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:03,518
INTO THE MIND OF YOUR SPOUSE.

119
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:05,954
THE ONLY THING THAT THE TRUMP

120
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,554
ADMINISTRATION IS DOING

121
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:07,188
DIFFERENTLY THAN THE OBAMA

122
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:08,690
ADMINISTRATION WHEN IT COMES TO

123
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,691
PEOPLE WITH UNACCOMPANIED

124
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:12,327
MINORS, IT’S A CRIMINAL

125
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:13,194
VIOLATION ONE IT COMES TO ADULTS

126
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:15,130
TRYING TO CROSS OUR BORDERS

127
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,730
ILLEGALLY.

128
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,665
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DO YOU DO

129
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:18,767
WITH THE KIDS?

130
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,536
WHAT HERE ARE THE IS THE KICKER.

131
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:24,473
ALMOST ALL OF THEM WILL STAY IN

132
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:28,377
AMERICA FOR AS LONG AS THEY WAN

133
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:28,944
WANT.

134
00:04:28,944 --> 00:04:31,880
LET’S -- WE ALWAYS SEND HOME --

135
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,749
WE ONLY SENT HOME SOMETHING LIKE

136
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:35,284
FIVE KIDS LAST YEAR.

137
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:36,485
IF AN UNACCOMPANIED MINOR GETS

138
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,321
TO OUR BORDER, THEY STAY IN

139
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:39,855
AMERICA.

140
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:42,558
AND MOST OF THEM, OR GIVING,

141
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:46,295
GIVEN A PLACE TO SAY, THEY ARE

142
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:48,263
GIVEN TO RELATIVES WHO ARE

143
00:04:48,263 --> 00:04:49,298
THEMSELVES HERE ILLEGALLY.

144
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:50,833
SO WHEN DEMOCRATS SAY THAT THE

145
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,503
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LOST 1500

146
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,472
KIDS, MARA’S RIGHT, THAT’S NOT

147
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:56,839
ACCURATE.

148
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,140
WE’VE ACTUALLY LOST 20 MILLION

149
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,941
PEOPLE AND OF THOSE 20 MILLION

150
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:00,776
PEOPLE ARE BRINGING IN MORE

151
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:02,511
RELATIVES TO THE BORDER.

152
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,512
THAT’S WHY WHETHER YOU BUILD A

153
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,282
WALL OR NOT, WE HAVE PROBLEMS OF

154
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:07,950
THE BORDER THAT THERE ARE ALL

155
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,518
THESE LOOPHOLES THAT ALLOW YOU

156
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,887
TO HOPSCOTCH IN LINE TO BE IN

157
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:13,322
AMERICA IF YOU WANT TO BE.

158
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:15,324
>> Bret: THE KEY POINT HERE IS

159
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:17,527
THE REASON THE LAW STORY IS NOT

160
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,495
ACCURATE IS BECAUSE THEY WERE

161
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:24,600
CALLING THESE.

162
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:32,075
AND THEY DIDN’T RETURN A, JOHN

163
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:34,177
KELLY, JEFF SESSIONS SAYING, WE

164
00:05:34,177 --> 00:05:35,778
ARE GOING TO SEPARATE THESE KIDS

165
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:38,114
AS A LAW SAYS WE SHOULD, SO

166
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:38,615
DON’T BRING THEM.

167
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:39,883
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SOUNDS LIKE

168
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:42,752
THEY FEEL THAT THEY WANT TO

169
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:43,753
BLAME THAT SEPARATION ON

170
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:44,120
DEMOCRATS.

171
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,755
>> Bret: BUT DO YOU THINK THIS

172
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:48,591
IS A POLITICAL ISSUE, ONE THAT’S

173
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:51,294
POWERFUL FOR THE DEMOCRATS?

174
00:05:51,294 --> 00:05:53,496
>> WE WANT TO SAY THE TRUMP

175
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:54,297
ADMINISTRATION IS HEARTLESS.

176
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:56,099
BUT WHAT IS SO INTERESTING TO ME

177
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:58,468
IS THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES HAVE A

178
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:00,704
SOUP TOP SPOT IN THE IMMIGRATION

179
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:03,673
DEBATE.

180
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:05,375
THE DACA KIDS, HE OFTEN SAYS HE

181
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,710
LOVES THEM AND WANTS TO TREAT

182
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,311
THEM WITH A GREAT HEART.

183
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:09,446
HE CLEARLY DOESN’T WANT TO BE ON

184
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:13,483
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE STORY.

185
00:06:13,483 --> 00:06:15,485
>> Bret: AND STEVE, LAST WORD.

186
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,421
THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE AS WE HEAD

187
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,389
TOWARD THE MIDTERMS?

188
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,091
>> THAT’S EASY.

189
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:23,293
