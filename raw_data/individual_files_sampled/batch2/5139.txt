as the FBI gets pulled into the fight over judge Brett Cavanaugh's nomination more and more is trickling out that could be confirmed or debunked with a professional investigation into the sexual assault allegations ones that Cavanaugh denies so let's take a look at what surfaced without FBI agents looking into this first of all professor ford says Cavanaugh was drunk when he allegedly assaulted her at a high school party in Maryland Cavanaugh's yearbook lists keg city club as one of his activities saying 100 kegs or bust ford also claims the Cavanaugh's friend mark judge was in the room when she was allegedly assaulted in his yearbook mark judge has a reference to alcoholics unanimous along with the 100 kegs or bustline and he refers to a bart asking if he booths yet according to urban dictionary that's a slang term for a sex act or a sex act involving drugs Cavanaugh's page contains the line judge have you boofed yet and in one of Mark judges books he describes a Bart o Cavanaugh who is referenced as vomiting in the backseat of a car and passing out after a party ford claims Cavanaugh sexually assaulted her trying to undress her with mark judge in the room in Cavanaugh's yearbook there's a line about the Devil's Triangle a slang term according to urban dictionary referencing two men engaging in the Senna sex act with the same woman at the same time we haven't seen other students pages so we don't know if these comments are representative of other comments or unique to Brett Kavanaugh and Mark judge in 2015 Cavanaugh reflected on a saying between his his classmates at Georgetown Prep we had a good saying that we've held firm to to the to this day as the Dean was reminding me before before the talk which is what happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown from that's been a good thing for all of us that's up to investigators to figure out how relevant that is but he did use a version of that line in a 2014 speech at a federalist society meeting according to a transcript obtained by the Washington Post he discussed his time that he and other law school classmates attended a rite Red Sox game and returned on a bus very intoxicated Kavanagh said quote we had a motto what happens on the bus stays on the bus but there's one more quote Cavanaugh made that same night that doesn't quite square with these last two comments he says always act as if your actions are public here's what I don't get Allie if anybody looked at my high school yearbook I would totally be embarrassed sure my kids I'm embarrassed big hair pom-poms cheesy best friends forever lines you might be in a leisure suit with a big fro I don't know but I am blown away before I saw this stuff I'm like oh come on what could be in this guy's yearbook like a little nonsense this is sick stuff right the devil's triangle in your yearbook forever and ever so you can say I mean what is poor Brett Kavanaugh his family going through how humiliating he's got this out there and this isn't a one-night you have time to judge this is going to go in my yearbook printed forever like some abusive stuff there's another line from Kavanaugh speech that I think applies to this moment he says you will make mistakes sometimes big ones admit it resolved not to do it again and make sure you don't do it again that's interesting so now we want to bring in an NBC News investigative reporter Kendall a nyan an MSNBC contributor and former US attorney and senior FBI official Chuck Rosenberg Chuck I want to go to you first a background check of Brett Kavanaugh already happened now we're talking about should it be reopened the kind of stuff were reading in his yearbook the statements he made why wouldn't that have been a red flag with that just being cut with that not be considered much all right or it only seems strange because now we have an accuser you know Stephanie it might have been in the background investigation that the FBI gave to the White House we don't know that but given all the other things we now know all the things have alle outlined at the beginning of this segment it makes perfect sense for me to the White House to ask the FBI to reopen it and if they ask or direct them to do it the FBI will that's their job they do investigations and that's also why this is not a he-said she-said situation I think that the formulation is nonsensical no it's not yeah I'd be glad to because there are so many other things out there that could either corroborate or confirm what either a person is saying there are friends to talk to there are teachers to talk to there are parents to talk to you could canvass social media there's lots of things you could do to determine whether one is telling the truth and one is lying or if simply they don't remember there is there are ways to corroborate this this is what the FBI does they ought to be asked to do it here Judiciary Committee part of the problem here is the Judiciary Committee only plans to call two witnesses versus the 22 that were called during Anita Hills hearing what's the difference what's what's the significance of that well it suggests to me look trials are about a search for the truth they're not perfect but what they attempt to do through testimony and confrontation is determine the truth and the way you do that is by putting in lots of witnesses and lots of evidence Senate hearings in my view are not a search for the truth they are an attempt to advance a political interest though that's not a good thing or a bad thing it's just a different thing but if what we really want to do here is find the truth then you would do it as exhaustively and thoroughly as is possible does that mean 22 witnesses I don't know but it certainly means more than two and it certainly means Ally that you don't start at the end you don't start with the two most important witnesses you start with other people who knew them who might have been there who might have heard something and who can corroborate this or refute it can what are people inside the FBI telling you I don't know anything about how these exhausts and background checks work but now when I look at Brett Kavanaugh is yearbook it makes me scratch but would it not have been an issue before it wouldn't have raised a flag well what they're saying is that they would be happy as Chuck said to investigate further this allegation if only the White House would authorize them to do that and they would be fully capable of going to talk to witnesses in private outside the glare of the media spotlight going to talk for example this woman in Mexico City who was a schoolmate of blousy Ford who says she remembers hearing something about this she has no first-hand information doesn't know whether it's true but remembers people talking about it that's the kind of thing and if I could just go back to the the Thomas Hill hearings because that's the real precedent of this and remember that was considered a deeply flawed process thomas was narrowly confirmed and there was a lot of reporting and books and elsewhere afterwards that brought out negative information about thomas that made a lot of people think that he was actually guilty of sexual harassment but that wasn't included that hearing nonetheless there were as you said 22 witnesses were called including three people who testified that Hill had told them at the time about this conduct none of that is gonna happen in this case if this plan goes forward no effort to seek corroboration either by the FBI or anyone else by the way the FBI did investigate the hill Thomas mattered they took three days they did what they could and they filed a report to the White House the White House determined that it was unfounded but there's no effort being made to investigate this and that's what I think a lot of people are concerned by it guys why it's a good question maybe Chuck if you call the FBI in to investigate a comment you've made one has to know that lying to the FBI is a serious offense yeah Ally that's right and so a lot of people have pointed out and I think it's an important and thoughtful comment if I've done something wrong if I've lied if I have something to cover up then probably the last group of people that I want looking at me and my conduct is the FBI right and so look if this doesn't tell me you know convincingly or sort of completely that dr. Ford is telling the truth but it is an indication that she's telling the truth and it is a reason to ask the FBI if it can to determine this now there's a problem here this happened many years ago that doesn't make it impossible to do so it just makes it difficult the FBI does difficult cases they do them all the time and if asked they can do it here how narrow can an investigation be though Chuck stay with me for a minute because I think back to when the Robert Muller investigation started and people said this is going to be so treacherous for the president because there's not any real boundaries here he could go anywhere if Brett Kavanaugh is telling the truth and to the best of our knowledge there is no track record there is no pattern it is a one-off that's wildly out of character what's the downside for him well I don't know that there's much downside if he's telling the truth it to your point Stephanie if the investigation the reinvestigation were to go far and wide broad and deep and they found all sorts of other stuff I guess my response to that is then so be it if by narrow you'll do if by narrow you mean can it be done quickly and efficiently I think the answer is yes look the FBI has 13,500 special agents men and women who are pretty good at asking questions and getting answers you could throw a whole bunch of agents two dozen of them at this quickly and they can do it efficiently and if there's nothing there then so be it but there doesn't seem to me to be a reason not to ask guys thanks very much for your analysis on this Chuck Rosenberg is a former US attorney and senior FBI official Kendall a nyan is our NBC News national security and intelligence reporter Ally I understand why the Senate Judiciary Committee for political reasons is like let's get this done midterms but if I'm black Cavanaugh my name my reputation is everything I might feel like you know what please do it he's a less concerned about the midterms this is his life hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest interviews and highlights you can get more MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
