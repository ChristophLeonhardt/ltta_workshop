a Miami cop has been suspended with pay of course after cellphone video surfaced of him kicking a suspect in the face during an arrest take a look at the video buddy you trippin now the officer has been identified as Mario Figueroa and he has been in the MPD for two years now the woman who captured the cell phone video gave her account of the incident saying that the suspect was being chased by the officers and was looking to find a way to get out once he realized he couldn't escape the suspect put his hands up and walked to meet the officers face-to-face and the officers then gave him instructions to get on his knees and then lie down and the suspect complied now after the man was handcuffed the other police officer ran right at him and kicked him like a football she said now the suspect who is 31 year-old Miami resident David vadim Suazo was arrested and charged with third degree grand theft of vehicle fleeing and eluding a police officer reckless driving and damage to property or person and habitual driving with a suspended license now that Miami PD after this video came out have apologized and they said today the city of Miami Police Department received a video of an incident involving one of my officers the video depicts a clear violation of policy the officer has been relieved of duty and the Miami State Attorney's Office has been contacted but he sound like paid vacation yeah I was gonna say they're so sorry that they're like oh you know with pay suspended with pay that's not that sorry yeah yeah and the mainstream media bothers me look this is a small example of it and maybe a overemphasizing it but ABC News which is actually among the best of them so it's ironic in this case and I'm sure that they all did it but they say they he the cop appears to kick the prone suspect we all just saw it he kicked the suspect in the head and the and the witness says that spit flew out of his mouth and then it was all over him when the cops put him up why cuz they did there's a deference to power oh I don't want to say that he kicked the suspect what if the cops push back and say he didn't kick the suspect well you have a video we have we all saw it yeah but of course by far the more important thing is this is the stuff that they've been doing all along and we just didn't have it on tape before and they would deny deny deny and that's why the media would say well one side says there's no other side says that and generally we of course trust power it turns out well we were wrong to trust power I don't know that I ever did but well no I did back when I was a Republican know people lie all the time and so now that we capture these things on tape we see what actually happens so this is not new but it is new that they're getting caught and at least some little thing is being done about it yeah I mean it's we have it on tape it's not a debate it is what it is for sure but I just I I feel like this has to be said at least I don't know for me the dude reckless driving damage to property or person habitual suspended license and driving and doing all this stuff all these arrests he could have killed somebody he could have hurt somebody else and if you're gonna do crazy stuff that's taking your life and other people's life at risk the risk you're also taking is someone might kick you in the face I need also don't be a don't be a bad guy that's doing bad things to other people but at the same time this guy was handcuffed face down in the grass we all saw that he it wasn't like he was like going to move towards the cop he was already handcuffed the other guy had handcuffed him he's faced out this guy's in a running across the field like I don't need to know Lucy and Charlie Brown I don't know if he was like practicing his soccer whatever like kick or whatever but that was it was unnecessary no matter what your you know your alleged guilt as a car you know your crime is if your I gave up I'm in handcuffs no need to kick the guy for sure I think I'm just thinking more cosmically like be the kind of person that can walk out the door and not risk getting kicked in the face but do you know your dad you say I don't think any of us are arguing that he shouldn't better I shouldn't have been arrested right I think he deserves to be arrested and they were you know pursuing that I think what's really alarming is the way they handle the arrests and this is something that we see time and time again even taking out the incident of him getting kicked in the face when you see he's on the ground he's already conceded he has handcuffs then like five other cops run over and they're all like this guy is already being peaceful he's already on the ground he's already handcuffed why do you need so much backup and in such an aggressive state I think that's the problem that people are having with the police these days is or I guess always but now that we're seeing it I think that the problem is is that they're coming in and they're ready to use their badge and their gun and their taser and they're ready to like be have that sort of power trip and that's what he maybe he tripped on his head maybe literally but I mean that's that's I think what we're seeing in here and I think that's what's so alarming and discouraging these people you people should call I'll cut the cops on these kinds of people people should call the cops for help and to have then you call the cop for help somebody and then there be a death or a kick in the face or any location if you already handcuffed on the ground and and getting executed everything I'm just I just want to slip in like be the kind of person I can leave your door and like I'm not planning on getting kicked in the face because I mean but if you put if you take that into the context of what is happening in the bigger picture these brutality right now come on there are people that are getting kick to the head I'm sure that have done nothing well don't deserve to be kicked it there what are they getting choked to death that have done nothing I'm walking out of the door and knowing that you're not gonna cake to get kicked in the face by a police officer means walking out the door and being white and he's on our way I mean that's the truth so yeah Lou let's go through all the context real quick so Gina first of all you're not would be very very very unlikely for you to get kicked in the head by a cop okay period period you could have stolen a car you could have done reckless driving when you're lying with your head hands behind your head like that there's no way I mean not no way but very okay but and we've seen case after case of unarmed people who were totally innocent guys shot in his backyard because he had a cell phone a guy who picked up a toy gun at a Walmart where they sell toy guns right so in this case yeah the guy has a bunch of aliases and he it looks like he did it but that's why we have jail that's why he's gonna go to jail it's not the cops it's the cops role to arrest them it's not the cops role to give out punishment oh there was no serving or protecting in this case I said nobody's debating that that's right yeah yeah and for this woman who's taking the video to be like yeah yeah I actually think she had the best court other than damn she went asked later she want to be anonymous she's like I don't want to get in the middle of this fact but she just happened to have the tape which was I'm glad she did she said about the cops we respect you guys we need you guys we call you we don't expect you to come and just be beating people up for no reason the man was down he didn't resist arrest so I think that that's the best point of all and so we got to be able to trust our cops and when I say we I mean everyone and in that community they got to be able to trust the cops so they'll call them so that they'll have a relationship where they're working together and preventing crime instead of worried hey
