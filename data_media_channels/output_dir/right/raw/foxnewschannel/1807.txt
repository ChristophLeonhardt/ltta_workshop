THREATENING TO KILL THEM.

7
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:27,386

00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:29,054
ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE, SLAPPING,

9
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:30,756
HITTING, CHOKING.

10
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:32,124
BEAR IN MIND THIS WAS AN

11
00:00:32,124 --> 00:00:33,992
INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS PUBLIC

12
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,628
CHAMPION OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS WHO,

13
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:39,932
IN FACT, INTRODUCED ANTICHOKING

LEGISLATION.

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,067
>> BECAUSE SCHNEIRDERMAN HAS

16
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:43,635
BEEN INVESTIGATING AND SUING

17
00:00:43,635 --> 00:00:50,309

00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:52,745
PRESIDENT.

20
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:53,412
>> IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE

21
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:54,613
PEOPLE IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

22
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:56,415
GLOATING ABOUT THIS GIVEN THAT

23
00:00:56,415 --> 00:00:58,617
THERE ARE PLENTY OF CHARGES

24
00:00:58,617 --> 00:01:00,352
AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP AS WELL.

25
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,154
>> BUT INSTEAD OF GOING AFTER

26
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:03,622
SCHNEIRDERMAN FOR HIS MISDEEDS

27
00:01:03,622 --> 00:01:05,324

THE SCANDAL, IT'S JUST ANOTHER

30
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:14,233
VEHICLE FOR TRASHING

31
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:14,733

SCHNEIRDERMAN QUITTING ALMOST

38
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:44,696
IMMEDIATELY, POWERFUL CRITICISM.

39

COMMENDED O.

41
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:51,837
>> KATHY, A LOT OF LEFT-LEANING

42
00:01:51,837 --> 00:01:53,038
JOURNALISTS, PEOPLE WHO HAD HIM

43
00:01:53,038 --> 00:01:54,540
AS GUEST, FELT BETRAYED BECAUSE

44
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,276
HE WAS A DEMOCRAT WHO DID PUT

45
00:01:57,276 --> 00:01:58,877
HIMSELF FORWARD AS CHAMPION OF

46
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:01,947
WOMEN'S RIGHT AND SUED HARVEY

47
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:03,749
WEINSTEIN AND THERE WAS SENSE ON

00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,617
THE LEFT.

49
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:06,819
>> HE BETRAYED WOMEN AND

50
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:07,252
HUMANITY.

51
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,187
THE STORY IS AWFUL BUT IT'S

52
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:09,755
BEAUTIFUL JOURNALISM.

53
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,758
THIS IS A FREE PRESS AND THIS IS

54
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,226
WHAT THE SUPPRESS SUPPOSED TO

55
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:14,927
DO.

56
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:15,894
THEY UNCOVERED SOMETHING

57
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:17,663
TERRIFIC AND HORRIBLE, LOOK AT

58
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:19,398
WHAT HAPPENED AS IT RESULT, THIS

59
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:23,769
IS JOURNALISM AT ITS BEST.

60
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,905
>> I THINK WE HAVE A CONSENSUS,

61
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:28,273
WHAT ABOUT SEXUAL ALLEGATIONS

62
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,075
AGAINST HIM, WHAT DO YOU MAKE

63
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:32,711
THE WAY THE STORY STARTED TO

64
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:33,212
TURN?

65
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:36,248

AND APPALLING ALLEGATIONS AND

68
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:42,654
QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN UNANSWERED

69
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:43,989
ESPECIALLY WHO KNEW WHAT AND

70
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:46,291
WHEN THEY KNEW IT AND WE SEE

71
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,726
THIS SHIFT TO WASHINGTON POST

72
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:51,697
ARTICLE THAT HEADLINE IS TRUMP,

73
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:53,532
SCHNEIRDERMAN, CHANGING SHAPE OF

74
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:56,268
SEX SCANDAL, COMPLETELY CHANGED

75
00:02:56,268 --> 00:02:56,935
FROM IMPORTANT INVESTIGATION

76
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:58,237
THAT HAD BEEN DONE THAT NEEDED

77
00:02:58,237 --> 00:03:00,706
TO BE CONTINUED AND FOLLOWED UP

78
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:02,040
ONTO TIE REPUBLICANS AND

79
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,376
PARTICULARLY PRESIDENT TRUMP.

80
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:06,245
HOWIE: KATHY, THIS WAS BECAUSE

81
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:08,347
DONALD TRUMP, JR. AND KELLYANNE

82
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:17,890
CONWAY SEEMED TO ENJOY DOWNFALL.

83
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,724
>> STILL, THIS IS THE WAY

84
00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:19,758
JOURNALISM WORKS NOW.

85
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:21,326
WE HAD THE STORY COME OUT AND

86
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,728
NOW COMES THE ANALYSIS AND YOU

87
00:03:22,728 --> 00:03:23,896
DO HAVE A PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE

88
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:26,532
HOUSE THAT HAS HIS OWN

89
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:28,066
ALLEGATIONS GOING ON, SEXUAL

90
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,202
ALLEGATIONS FROM DIFFERENT

91
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,870
EVERY DAY IN THE NEWS, SO WE

92
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,206
HEAR NOW THAT THIS MAN, DEMOCRAT

93
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:36,041
RESIGNED BECAUSE HE COULDN'T

94
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,209
LEAD BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS GOING

95
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,645
ON IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE, SO

96
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:40,946
PEOPLE ARE TURNING AROUND AND

97
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:42,915
SAY, CAN OUR PRESIDENT LEAD AT

98
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:44,082
THIS CRITICAL TIME GIVEN WHAT'S

99
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:45,951
GOING ON WITH THESE ALLEGATIONS.

100
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:47,753
SO IT ONLY MAKES SENSE THAT THE

101
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:49,254
NEWS CYCLE CAN START TURNING.

102
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:50,856
THIS IS THE WAY JOURNALISM IS.

103
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,625
HOWIE: AND ALSO REFLECTS, SOME

104
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,028
PARTISANSHIP IN THE MEDIA, SO

105
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,229
TWO VERY DIFFERENT.

106
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:58,931
>> MAYBE, MAYBE.

107
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:00,966
HOWIE: NBC HAS CONDUCTED,

108
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:03,569
COMPLETED INTERNAL REVIEW OF THE

109
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,537
MATT LAUER FIRING AND DECIDED

110
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,673
THAT SENIOR MANAGEMENT WAS

111
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:08,740
UNAWARE OF THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT

112
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,375
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE FORMER

113
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,711
TODAY ANCHOR.

114
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,013
THAT PROBE GOT CRITICISM, IT WAS

115
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:18,983
CONDUCTED IN-HOUSE, NO OUTSIDE

116
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:20,685
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

117
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,521
LAUER'S FORMER COHOST, SHE WENT

118
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:24,323
TO MANAGEMENT A COUPLE OF TIMES

119
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:26,158
ABOUT WOMEN WHO CAME TO HER TO

120
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:29,328
COMPLAIN ABOUT LAUER.

121
00:04:29,328 --> 00:04:31,363
LET ME GET YOU TWO ON ONE OTHER

122
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:32,764
THING, THE PRESIDENT TWEETING

123
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:34,266
AFTER STUDY BY CONSERVATIVE

124
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:35,801
MEDIA GROUP REFLECTS OTHER

125
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,202
STUDIES THAT NETWORK NEWS

126
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:40,105
COVERAGE OF THE PRESIDENT IS 90%

127
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,940
NEGATIVE, BUT THE PRESIDENT

128
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,742
ATTACKED ONTO THAT TWEET, WHY DO

129
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,911
WE WORK SO HARD IN WORKING WITH

130
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,046
THE MEDIA WHEN IT'S CORRUPT?

131
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:50,582
TAKE AWAY CREDENTIALS QUESTION

132
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,484
MARK, GAIL, DOES THAT GO TOO

133
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:52,985
FAR?

134
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:55,387
>> NO EQUIVALENT OF TRUMP'S

135
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:56,755
BIGGER BUTTON TWEET TO KIM JONG

136
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,322
UN.

137
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:58,890
HOWIE: HE'S GOING NUCLEAR WITH

138
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,659
THE PRESS.

139
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:05,163
>> HE'S TELLING THEM HE HAS THE

140
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:06,965
CAPACITY AND THE MEDIA DOES NOT

141
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:07,899
UNDERSTAND THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

142
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:09,101
IS NOT TIED TO PLAYBOOK.

143
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,068
THE MEDIA THINK THAT IS THE

144
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,403
PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

145
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:13,739
CRITICIZE THE PRESS AND SHOULD

146
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:16,174
NOT SUGGEST FAKE NEWS AND BAD

147
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:17,242
REPORTING, PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST

148
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:20,012
WANTS THE PRESS TO PLAY FAIR.

149
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:21,980
HOWIE: WHEN YOU BRING UP

150
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,081
CREDENTIALS, ONE THING TO DO IT

151
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:24,750
AS CANDIDATE IN SOME CASES, IT'S

152
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,553
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU DO IT WHITE

153
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:29,521
HOUSE, I DON'T THINK DONALD

154
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:31,456
TRUMP WOULD DO THIS, IT'S TAKING

155
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:35,127
A SLAP AT THE PRESS, DOES IT

156
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,561
GIVE AMMUNITION THAT THE

157
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:38,864
PRESIDENT WOULD TRAMPLE ON FIRST

158
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:39,297
AMENDMENT.

159
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,600
>> THIS IS HORRIBLE.

160
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,170
IS THIS A DICTATOR, ARE WE IN

161
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,005
CUBA, RUSSIA, CHINA.

162
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:49,441
THIS IS NOT STATE-RUNED

NEWSPAPERS.

164
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,411
HOWIE: IT'S JUST A TWEET.

165
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:56,014
>> JUST A TWEET, I HAD MY WHITE

166
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:59,051
HOUSE PRESS CREDENTIALS AND YOU

167
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:01,053
WORK HARD TO GET CREDENTIALS,

168
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:03,188
THEY DON'T HAND OUT TO ANYONE.

169
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:05,323
TO SAKE THEY WILL TAKE AWAY

170
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,626
CREDENTIALS, WE NEED THE MEDIA,

171
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:09,695
EVERY MAN TO SIT INSIDE AND ASK

172
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:10,595
TOUGH QUESTIONS.

173
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:13,098
>> THEY NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE

174
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:14,066
WITH THEM?

175
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:16,334
>> IT'S NOT EASY TO GET

GET THEM, JUST ANYONE FROM THE

179
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:21,540
YEAH.

180
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,741
HOWIE: THEY DO NEED TO BE

181
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:24,076
RESPONSIBLE IN COVERAGE BUT I

182
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:25,343
DON'T THINK THE PENALTY SHOULD

00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:32,284
BE PULL GET AWAY PRED --
