here to help me understand what this means to the White House and beyond Senator Richard Blumenthal democratic Connecticut a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee one of the most sort of notable things about McGann all other things aside for the moment is that there was reporting that he stood in the way the president firing mulher back in January 25th that Trump ordered Muller fired but backed off when basically McGann threatened to quit between that and sessions likely imminent dismissal what do you think the White House is up to first McGann has been perceived in the Congress as a voice of reason and respect to the norms in a White House that has very little of either he was a calming and moderating influence willing to stand up to the President and say no you know White has that has very few people willing to do it and he said no to firing Muller now he did go to Jeff Sessions and try to persuade him to recuse himself which sessions refused to do he basically had no choice McGann accepted that refusal but the president never has he wants a roy cohn someone who will have his back and protect him and serve his interests so I think McGann's leaving will possibly embolden the president to try to fire sessions again even though it would provoke a firestorm on Capitol Hill you really think it would be firing sessions would take what McConnell Mitch McConnell said yes in the last 48 hours that he thinks sessions should stay and I think Lindsey Graham was right not recently when he said that the president would be better served by another Attorney General but a year ago when he said that it would be holy hell to pay if sessions were fired I think the president would have a lot of difficulty trying to confirm someone who replaced Jeff Sessions um you know after this story broke that that McGann had spent all that time with Muller the president tweeted this failing New Times were a fake piece today implying that because White House Counsel Don Magan was giving ours a testimony to special counsel he Bijan Dean type rat but I allowed him all doors to testify I didn't have to I have nothing to hide there is the Dean precedent who was Nixon's White House Counsel who also did time in prison when you think about what it is McGann knows nobody knows all of what he knows but he's been at the president's right arm as the president has committed some acts that very plausibly amount to obstruction of justice there's a credible case of obstruction of justice right now against the president United States and Don McGann has been at his side at his right arm through all of it he knows the motive he knows what the president said when he wanted to fire call me initially he helped devise a pretext for firing Comey with rod Rosenstein and he has been in a sense a witness to potential obstruction of justice by the president I say he has also been by the way the chief architect and strategist in the administration's remaking the federal courts in the image of the far-right extreme ideology of this Republican Party he was he's been spending all this time on Capitol Hill working on Kavanagh the Kavanagh nomination in preparation for the hearings we're we're where do you stand in in terms of preparation for those hearings I am actively preparing as recently as minutes before coming to talk to you and I think that we are greatly handicapped in preparing because this administration is concealing documents that are essential to our providing real advice and consent they've disclosed only about 6% of the documents relating to Kavanagh service in the Bush White House only 6% and that is as a result of screening by the way by a lawyer who is Don McGann's personal order bill Burke the interconnection here are silly it's dumb again and Steve Bannon share a lawyer this in exactly and I am I right he's the one deciding what all of us as Americans get to see of the record of a man who served in public office in the White House what all of us as Americans get to see and what we as senators get to see he is denying us access to papers in the National Archives that are the property of the American people well but how's that work I mean why can he do that because the Republican leadership in the United States Senate has made a rule that in effect they will delegate to him I see that assignment now we have challenged it we have argued against it and frankly when these hearings being on Tuesday we're gonna renew our effort to have all those documents come to the American people as well as to us I'd like to see them Senator Richard Blumenthal thanks for sharing your time thank you Chris hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
