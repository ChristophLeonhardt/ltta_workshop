1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,763
>> NIKKI HALEY, AMBASSADOR

2
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:12,199
TO THE UNITED NATIONS HAS

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,501
BEEN VERY SPECIAL FOR ME.

4
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:17,704
SHE HAS DONE A

5
00:00:17,705 --> 00:00:20,040
SHE HAS DONE GREAT JOB.

6
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,208
WE'RE SAD TO LOSE YOU.

7
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:22,509
YOU WILL COME BACK AT SOME

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,311
POINT MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT

9
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:24,678
CAPACITY.

10
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,413
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PICK.

11
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:27,147
STEVE: LOOK AT THAT HE LEFT

12
00:00:27,148 --> 00:00:29,549
THE DOOR OPEN TO HER.

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,150
KELLYANNE, COUNSELOR TO

14
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:30,817
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

15
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:31,652
KELLYANNE, YOU ARE THERE AT

16
00:00:31,653 --> 00:00:32,319
THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,554
WHITE HOUSE IT LOOKS LIKE

18
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:35,355
PROBABLY KNEW BEHIND THE

19
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:37,324
SCENES THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO

20
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:37,658
LEAVE.

21
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:38,025
WE DIDN'T.

22
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:39,826
WHY IS SHE LEAVING?

23
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:40,494
CAN YOU TELL US.

24
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:41,695
>> IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE

25
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:42,796
AMBASSADOR AND PRESIDENT

26
00:00:42,797 --> 00:00:43,330
HAVE SEEN.

27
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:44,731
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE

28
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:46,133
SHEAR VOLUME AND VELOCITY

29
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:46,933
WITH THE WAY THIS PRESIDENT

30
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:52,072
AND HIS SENIOR ADVISORS WORK

31
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:52,839
MEANS YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH A

32
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
GREAT AMOUNT IN A VERY

33
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:54,408
LIMITED TIME.

34
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:55,676
LOOK WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

35
00:00:55,677 --> 00:00:56,143
DONE.

36
00:00:56,144 --> 00:00:56,643
HISTORIC ECONOMY.

37
00:00:56,644 --> 00:00:57,644
WORKING ON PEACE.

38
00:00:57,645 --> 00:00:59,012
NEW TRADE DEALS.

39
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:00,447
MODERNIZED TRADE DEALS.

40
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:01,882
DEREGULATION, OBVIOUSLY THE

41
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:03,050
LARGEST TAX CUT.

42
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:04,484
TWO SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.

43
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:06,219
26 ON THE CIRCUIT COURTS.

44
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,921
THAT ACTUALLY HAS A RIPPLE

45
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:09,289
EFFECT INTO ALL THESE

46
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,390
DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AS

47
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:11,758
WELL.

48
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:14,561
I THINK AT THE UNITED

49
00:01:14,562 --> 00:01:16,196
NATIONS AMBASSADOR HALEY HAS

50
00:01:16,197 --> 00:01:16,997
DISTINGUISHED HERSELF FOR

51
00:01:16,998 --> 00:01:17,431
THAT SERVICE.

52
00:01:17,432 --> 00:01:19,399
SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED ON THE

53
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,534
WORLD STAGE SINCE THIS

54
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:21,535
PRESIDENT HAS BECOME

55
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:22,269
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND HELD

56
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:22,969
OFFICE HERE.

57
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,838
AND ALSO, I'M GOING TO TAKE

58
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:25,939
AMBASSADOR HALEY AT HER WORD

59
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,542
THAT SHE IS LEAVING PUBLIC

60
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:29,976
SERVICE NOW, OBVIOUSLY SHE

61
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:32,012
HAS BEEN A PUBLIC SERVANT

62
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:33,714
FOR, GOSH, I THINK IT'S

63
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:36,016
MAYBE 15 OR 16 CONSECUTIVE

64
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:36,416
YEARS NOW.

65
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:37,451
AND SHE WILL GO OUT TO THE

66
00:01:37,452 --> 00:01:38,719
PRIVATE SECTOR, I BELIEVE,

67
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,486
AND DO VERY WELL.

68
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:40,954
I THINK WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE

69
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:41,888
HER ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

70
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:43,290
I SORT OF THOUGHT MAYBE SHE

71
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,624
WOULD SAY SHE WAS LEAVING

72
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,559
NEW ZEALAND TO JOIN THE

73
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,360
PRESIDENT AND THE VICE

74
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:47,661
PRESIDENT ON THE CAMPAIGN

75
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:48,628
TRAIL THESE LAST 30 DAYS

76
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:50,030
BECAUSE SHE WOULD HAVE A

77
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:51,264
POSITIVE IMPACT OUT THERE.

78
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:52,999
BUT, SHE FEELS LIKE SHE HAS

79
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,403
MORE WORK TO ACCOMPLISH.

80
00:01:56,404 --> 00:01:57,104
BUT, AMBASSADOR HALEY WILL

81
00:01:57,105 --> 00:02:00,440
BE DEEPLY MISSED AND WIDELY

82
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:00,807
RESPECTED.

83
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:04,978
AND FINALLY REGARDED FOR A --

84
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:05,645
FONDLY REGARDED FOR A VERY

85
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:06,413
LONG TIME.

86
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:09,316
NOT JUST THE WORK SHE

87
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:10,717
ACCOMPLISHED BUT THE WAY SHE

88
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:12,819
ACCOMPLISHED THAT WORK THE

89
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,286
GRACE, DIGNITY.

90
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:14,221
THE AMERICA FIRST WAY SHE

91
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:15,455
WENT ABOUT HER WORK.

92
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:16,857
REMEMBER WHEN SHE RAISED HER

93
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,458
HAND, SHE PRESIDED OVER

94
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:21,962
HISTORIC BACK-TO-BACK

95
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:22,796
UNANIMOUS VOTES AGAINST I

96
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:24,297
BELIEVE IT WAS RUSSIA OR

97
00:02:24,298 --> 00:02:27,768
NORTH KOREA AT THE TIME.

98
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:28,668
THOSE WERE SIGNIFICANT.

99
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:30,470
WITH HER AT THE TABLE, THIS

100
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:32,139
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO

101
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,473
SPLISH SO MUCH ON THE WORLD

102
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:33,774
STAGE.

103
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:34,641
WE ARE ALL GRATEFUL AND

104
00:02:34,642 --> 00:02:37,277
SHE'LL BE MISSED.

105
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:38,311
BRIAN: KELLYANNE, IN YOUR

106
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:39,679
PRIOR LIFE AND NEW LIFE YOU

107
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,014
LOOK AT POLLS ALL THE TIME

108
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:42,315
AND LOOK AT TRENDS ALL THE

109
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:42,883
TIME.

110
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:45,352
THEY SAY, POLITICO SAYS 209

111
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:46,620
SEATS EITHER FIRMLY OR

112
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:47,788
LEANING DEMOCRAT IN THE

113
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:48,221
HOUSE.

114
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:50,190
ONLY FINAL SHINE OF THE 218.

115
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:51,958
DO YOU AGREE WITH THOSE

116
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,994
NUMBERS AND, IF SO, OR IF

117
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:55,362
NOT, WHAT DO THE KAVANAUGH

118
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:57,964
HEARINGS DO FOR THOSE

119
00:02:57,965 --> 00:02:58,298
NUMBERS?

120
00:02:58,299 --> 00:02:59,499
>> A COUPLE THINGS.

121
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,200
HISTORICAL FRIENDS MEAN THAT

122
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:01,868
THE PARTY IN POWER LOSES

123
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:03,036
SEATS IN THE HOUSE.

124
00:03:03,037 --> 00:03:04,805
THIS IS JUST A PRESIDENT WHO

125
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:05,505
DEFIES TRENDS.

126
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:07,507
AND RATHER THAN REPEATING

127
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:09,142
HISTORY HE TENDS TO MAKE

128
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:09,476
HISTORY.

129
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:10,076
YOU CAN SEE WHAT HIS

130
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:11,178
STRATEGY IS BETWEEN NOW AND

131
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:11,778
ELECTION DAY.

132
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:13,213
HE IS LEAVING IT ALL ON THE

133
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:14,981
FIELD, RUNNING THROUGH THE

134
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:16,416
TAPE, EXACTLY WHAT HE AND

135
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:18,652
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE DID IN

136
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:19,152
2016.

137
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:19,853
SAME STRATEGY.

138
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:22,222
AND HE IS BRINGING IN HUGE

139
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:24,157
CROWDS TO THESE RALLIES NOT

140
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,294
BECAUSE IT'S NEW TO THEM

141
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:27,928
THAT MR. TRUMP, PRESIDENT

142
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:28,829
TRUMP WOULD COME TO THEIR

143
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,163
STATE OR AREAS, BUT BECAUSE

144
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:31,765
THEY ARE THERE AS A WAY TO

145
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:32,232
SAY THANK YOU.

146
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:33,467
THANK YOU FOR MAKING GOOD ON

147
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:36,303
SO MANY PROMISES SPARING AN

148
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:38,171
ECONOMIC BOOM THAT MANY IN

149
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:39,406
THE MEDIA WANT TO CONTINUAL

150
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:40,907
TO IGNORE EVERY DAY BUT THAT

151
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:41,975
EVERY SINGLE MOMENT THE

152
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:43,243
AMERICAN PEOPLE FEEL THEY

153
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:44,377
HAVE GOT JOB SECURITY BUT

154
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:46,446
ALSO JOB MOBILITY.

155
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:48,482
AND SO THERE ARE 43

156
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:48,882
RETIREMENTS.

157
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:50,350
I THINK THE HARDEST THING

158
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,618
ABOUT THE HOUSE MAP IS THAT

159
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:53,520
THERE ARE 43 REPUBLICAN

160
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:53,920
RETIREMENTS.

161
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:54,855
INCLUDING IN STATES LIKE NEW

162
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:55,589
JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA WHERE

163
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,891
HAD YOU LONG-TERM REPUBLICAN

164
00:03:57,892 --> 00:04:00,594
MEMBERS IN SEATS THAT IN 23

165
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:01,595
SEATS, FRANKLY THAT EVEN THE

166
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:03,196
WOMAN WHO LOST THAT ELECTION

167
00:04:03,197 --> 00:04:06,132
HAD CARDS

168
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:06,166
HAD CEEDS

169
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:08,969
HAD CEERD

170
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,002
HAD CARRD

171
00:04:09,003 --> 00:04:10,103
HAD CARRIED IN 2016.

172
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:10,737
THAT'S TOUGH BUT THIS

173
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:11,638
PRESIDENT IS OUT THERE

174
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,706
SAYING HEY A VOTE FOR THIS

175
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:14,174
PERSON IS A VOTE FOR MY

176
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:15,475
AGENDA AND HE CAN DO THAT

177
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:17,010
HAVING SAID ALL THAT LET'S

178
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:18,812
NOT FORGET THE SAME GENIUSES

179
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,614
THAT PREDICTED A HUGE ROMP

180
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,816
BY THAT WOMAN WHO LOST IN

181
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,150
2016 ARE THE SAME PEOPLE

182
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:26,286
PREDICTING A HUGE WIN BY THE

183
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:26,953
DEMOCRATS THIS TIME.

184
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:28,889
SO WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE

185
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,322
BIT CAUTIOUS.

186
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:31,958
I HEAR THAT OFTEN WHEN I'M

187
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,592
OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL

188
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:33,159
AND MY PERSONAL TIME.

189
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,127
PEOPLE WILL SAY HEY, I DON'T

190
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:35,362
BELIEVE THESE POLLS BECAUSE

191
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:37,831
IT COMES FROM THE SAME MEDIA

192
00:04:37,832 --> 00:04:39,299
THAT'S 92% NEGATIVE IN THEIR

193
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,400
COVERAGE ABOUT PRESIDENT

194
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:40,700
TRUMP.

195
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:41,568
AND HIS ADMINISTRATION.

196
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:44,604
AND SO, AND THAT'S NOT GOING

197
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:46,039
TO DETER THEM FROM SHOWING

198
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,473
UP.

199
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:47,607
WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THE

200
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:48,208
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS?

201
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:49,876
I THINK BECAUSE THE LEFT

202
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:50,911
CAN'T JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

203
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:52,078
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T LOOK AT

204
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,147
THE DIGNITY AND STURDINESS

205
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:55,081
OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME

206
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:57,417
COURT, ALL 8 JUSTICES COMING

207
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:58,518
TO THIS WHITE HOUSE IN THE

208
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,788
EAST ROOM IN THE FRONT ROW

209
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:03,023
TO WELCOME PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

210
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:05,025
LATEST NOMINEE, JUSTIFIABLE

211
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:05,859
KAVANAUGH, I THOUGHT THAT

212
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,360
WAS A REMARKABLE MOMENT TO

213
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,995
SEE ALL OF THEM HERE,

214
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:09,729
INCLUDING THE THREE WOMEN

215
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,832
WHO HAD BEEN NOMINATED BY

216
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,167
TWO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS.

217
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:15,936
THEY ARE HERE BECAUSE THE

218
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:18,104
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

219
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:19,839
IS A SACROSANCT STURDY

220
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,608
INSTITUTION THAT WILL WITH

221
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:23,243
STABBED THOSE PEOPLE

222
00:05:23,244 --> 00:05:25,011
FLAILING AND WHALEY IN FRONT

223
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:25,912
OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME

224
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:26,212
COURT.

225
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:27,914
ARE THEY ENERGIZED?

226
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:28,548
PERHAPS.

227
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:30,250
ARE THEY -- IS IT

228
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:30,884
PURPOSEFUL?

229
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:34,654
DID THEY BECOME ANGRY LAST

230
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:35,622
THREE WEEKS BECAUSE OF BRETT

231
00:05:35,623 --> 00:05:36,456
KAVANAUGH OR LAST THREE

232
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:40,093
YEARS BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT

233
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:40,827
TRUMP.

234
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:41,328
I DON'T THINK SO.

235
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:44,264
THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAY

236
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:47,500
THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAR

237
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:47,534
THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAN

238
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:47,567
THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAT

239
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:47,601
THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAN

240
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:47,634
THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAG

241
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:47,667
THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAI

242
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:49,269
THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAN

243
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,371
RANCOR AND -- SHOW UP AT THE

244
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:51,871
POLLS AS WELL.

245
00:05:51,872 --> 00:05:53,006
AGES AGES THEY ARE MAD

246
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:53,974
BECAUSE THEIR CANDIDATE

247
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:55,241
DIDN'T WIN, THAT WAS HILLARY

248
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:55,575
CLINTON.

249
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:57,143
MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING LET'S

250
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:59,512
BE CIVIL, LET'S GET ALONG.

251
00:05:59,513 --> 00:06:01,648
LET'S UNIFY BUTLIKE, SHE IS

252
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,317
AGREEING WITH THE MAXINE

253
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:05,885
WATERS OF THE WORLD IT A

254
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:06,219
APPEARS.

255
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,655
SEE IS SAYING CIVILITY IS

256
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:09,255
NOT AN OPTION.

257
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:10,924
>> YOU CANNOT BE CIVIL WITH

258
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:14,661
A POLITICAL PARTY THAT WANTS

259
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:15,528
TO DESTROY WHAT YOU STAND

260
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:16,796
FOR, WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT.

261
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:18,798
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IF WE

262
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:20,367
ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WIN

263
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:22,602
BACK THE HOUSE AND/OR THE

264
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:24,337
SENATE, THAT'S WHEN CIVILITY

265
00:06:24,338 --> 00:06:27,340
CAN START AGAIN.

266
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:28,274
STEVE: WELL, WHAT DOES THAT

267
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:30,176
MEAN EXACTLY, KELLYANNE?

268
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:34,614
>> LOOK, SHE USUALLY WHEN

269
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:37,450
SHE OPENINGS HER MOUTH

270
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:38,218
RESPECTFULLY SHE OFFENDS ONE

271
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:39,319
HALF OF THE COUNTRY AND SHE

272
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,253
DID IT AGAIN.

273
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:42,389
I THINK HER DISCOURSE NOW IS

274
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,756
DANGEROUS.

275
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:44,290
I DON'T LIKE THE

276
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:44,858
IMPLICATIONS HERE.

277
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:46,826
ONE THING TO CALL US

278
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:47,994
DEPLORABLE, IRREDEEMABLE.

279
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:49,896
LAUGH AT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO

280
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:50,664
HAVEN'T HAD ALL THE

281
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:53,366
PRIVILEGES SHE HAS HAD WITH

282
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:55,435
IVY LEAGUE LAW DEGREE AND

283
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:57,170
MARRIAGE A MAN WHO WAS A TWO

284
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:58,104
TERM PRESIDENT THAT SHE WILL

285
00:06:58,105 --> 00:06:58,605
NEVER BE.

286
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:00,206
I DON'T LIKE THAT KIND OF

287
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:02,809
TALK AND I AVOID IT MY BOSS

288
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,877
HAS CALLED FOR CIVILITY.

289
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:05,111
HE SAYS HE REPRESENTS ALL

290
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:05,478
AMERICANS.

291
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,946
WE DON'T RUN AROUND ASKING

292
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:08,815
PEOPLE WHAT THEIR PARTY

293
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:10,517
AFFILIATION IS WHEN HE IS

294
00:07:10,518 --> 00:07:11,785
CUTTING THEIR TAXES AND

295
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:12,886
ALLOWING SMALL BUSINESSES TO

296
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:14,721
BE FREE OF REGULATIONS AND

297
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:15,488
GROWTH.

298
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:16,723
WE ARE IMPERVIOUS TO THAT.

299
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:18,124
AND, YET, I WANT TO SAY

300
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,659
SOMETHING ELSE, I DON'T SEE

301
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,694
ALL THESE DEMOCRATIC

302
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:22,162
CANDIDATES BANGING DOWN

303
00:07:22,163 --> 00:07:23,430
HILLARY CLINTON'S DOOR

304
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:24,330
ASKING HER.

305
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:25,965
BRIAN: SHE IS DYING TO

306
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:26,299
MATTER.

307
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,001
>> AGAIN, SHE HAS TO GO WITH

308
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:29,469
HER HUSBAND TO DO THIS

309
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,706
13-CITY TOUR, 120 MILLION

310
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:33,073
BUCKS.

311
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:33,973
BRIAN: 700 BUCKS A TICKET.

312
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:35,942
>> THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

313
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:40,113
DONATE TO SOME WOMEN AND

314
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:40,413
GIRLS.

315
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:41,748
I DON'T SEE HER DOING THAT

316
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,149
UNFORTUNATE AND GRACELESS

317
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,286
BUT A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS.

318
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:46,820
BRIAN: GOTCHA.

319
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:48,054
KANYE WEST COMING TO THE

320
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:48,621
WHITE HOUSE TOMORROW.

321
00:07:48,622 --> 00:07:49,823
WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA BESIDES

322
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:50,123
LUNCH?

323
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:52,859
>> MAYBE HE WILL HAVE HIS

324
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,027
FAMOUS RED HAT.

325
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,128
SEVERAL THINGS ON THE

326
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:55,462
AGENDA.

327
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:57,063
OBVIOUSLY HE HAS CONNECTED

328
00:07:57,064 --> 00:07:58,965
TISSUE WITH MANY AMERICANS.

329
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:03,002
AND CAN, I THINK,

330
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:03,970
COMMUNICATE PARTS OF

331
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:05,171
PRESIDENT'S AGENDA THAT HE

332
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:07,273
AGREES WITH AND WILLING TO

333
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:07,674
FIGHT FOR.

334
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:08,708
OBVIOUSLY JARED KUSHNER AND

335
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,210
THE PRESIDENT ARE WORKING ON

336
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:11,444
PRISON REFORM.

337
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:13,413
KANYE WEST'S WIFE HAS BEEN

338
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:15,715
HERE BEFORE TALKING ABOUT

339
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:16,483
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS AND

340
00:08:16,484 --> 00:08:18,518
VERY BIG IN WHAT I CALL

341
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:21,121
GRAND MUM ALICE ONE OF MY

342
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:21,921
FAVORITE VIDEOTAPES OF ALL

343
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:24,023
TIME WATCHING HER RUN TO

344
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:24,357
FREEDOM.

345
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:26,192
I'M HOPING HE WILL ALSO HELP

346
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:28,962
US TACKLE, JOIN WITH US

347
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:30,163
TACKLING OPIOID CRISIS IN

348
00:08:30,164 --> 00:08:30,930
THIS COUNTRY.

349
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:32,065
IT IS RANK LING EVERYBODY.

350
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:33,933
TO GET PEOPLE OF HIS STATURE

351
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,400
TO ACTUALLY SPEAK ABOUT

352
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:36,002
THAT.

353
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:38,071
BUT, I THINK, LOOK, WE

354
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:39,205
WELCOME PEOPLE TO THE WHITE

355
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:41,374
HOUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY WHO

356
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,142
MAY NOT AGREE WITH

357
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:42,909
EVERYTHING THIS PRESIDENT

358
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,242
DOES.

359
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:44,878
IT'S ONE OF THE MANY

360
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,745
QUALITIES THAT AMERICANS

361
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:46,946
LOVE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT WHO

362
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:47,981
ARE ACTUALLY PAYING

363
00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:48,348
ATTENTION.

364
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:51,951
NOT BLINDED BY THEIR HATRED.

365
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:52,418
BRIAN: GOTCHA.

366
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:53,353
WE WELCOME HIM AND OTHERS.

367
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:54,420
MANY PEOPLE COME THROUGH THE

368
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:55,321
DOOR THAT YOU DON'T KNOW OF

369
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:57,257
AND HAVE LUNCH WITH THE

370
00:08:57,258 --> 00:08:59,092
PRESIDENT.

371
00:08:59,093 --> 00:08:59,459
PRIVATELY.

372
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,627
AND IT'S AN EXCHANGE OF

373
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,595
IDEAS AND THE PRESIDENT IS

374
00:09:02,596 --> 00:09:03,997
INCREDIBLY RESPECTFUL AND

375
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:04,798
OPEN TO LISTENING.

376
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,699
IS HE A GREAT LISTENER.

377
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,034
MEDICARE FOR ALL BY THE WAY

378
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:09,602
MEDICARE FOR ALL IS

379
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:10,236
SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT

380
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:11,204
OBAMA AND I ASSUME HILLARY

381
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:11,905
CLINTON WHEN SHE SAYS THAT

382
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:12,906
THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS

383
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:14,140
PARTY DISAGREE WITH THEIR

384
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:14,607
AGENDA.

385
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:16,142
MEDICARE FOR ALL IS ONE OF

386
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:16,876
THOSE.

387
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:18,945
IT'S ANTI-SENIOR,

388
00:09:18,946 --> 00:09:19,779
ANTICHOICE, ANTICONSUMER.

389
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,214
THE DEMOCRATS ARE FOR IT

390
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:22,615
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID IT

391
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:24,284
SOUNDS LIKE A NEW GOOD IDEA.

392
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:25,919
TOM PEREZ HAS SAID THAT THE

393
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,420
FUTURE OF THE PARTY IS FOR

394
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:29,022
MEDICARE FOR ALL.

395
00:09:29,023 --> 00:09:30,023
ABOUT 60 HOUSE MEMBERS AND A

396
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:30,890
THIRD OF THE DEMOCRATS

397
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:33,526
BEHIND IT SENIORS DON'T BE

398
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:34,227
FOOLED.

399
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:35,495
IT'S ANTI-SENIOR,

400
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:36,095
ANTICHOICE.

401
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:37,764
LOSE YOUR DOCTORS AND

402
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:38,698
DESTROY MEDICARE ADVANTAGE

403
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:39,566
AND I KNOW ALEXANDRIA

404
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:40,233
OCASIO-CORTEZ COULDN'T SAY

405
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:41,768
WHAT IT WOULD COST.

406
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,870
LET ME HELP HER OUT AGAIN

407
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:44,537
ABOUT $32 TRILLION IS THE

408
00:09:44,538 --> 00:09:45,605
ESTIMATE OF ITS PRICE TAG.

409
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:46,906
IT'S A HORRIBLE THING.

410
00:09:46,907 --> 00:09:48,808
I THINK POST OBAMACARE WITH

411
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:49,609
20 MILLION AMERICANS STILL

412
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,577
LACKING HEALTHCARE, THIS IS

413
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:52,445
SOMETHING THAT COULD

414
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:53,580
ACTUALLY HURT SENIORS AND

415
00:09:53,581 --> 00:00:00,000
