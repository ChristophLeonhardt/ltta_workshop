THIS.
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT
AND TRADE IMBALANCE WILL
END.
HERE NOW LARRY KUDLOW,
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL
ECONOMIC COUNCIL.
LARRY, GOOD TO SEE YOU
TONIGHT.
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.
>> THANKS, MARTHA.
APPRECIATE IT.
>> Martha: I GUESS, MY FIRST
QUESTION IS ABOUT THE SORT
OF BALANCE THAT WE HAVE SEEN
BETWEEN THE ONGOING TRADE
NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA, YOU
KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID A
WEEK OR SO AGO THAT HE WAS
SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THE SECOND
MEETING THAT THE NORTH
KOREAN LEADER HAD WITH
PRESIDENT XI.
AND SHORTLY YOU THOUGHT THAT
SORT OF MESSED THINGS UP IN
A WAIT A MINUTE SHORTLY
AFTER THAT YOU HAD A ZTE
DEAL THAT WAS REACHED.
NOW, HAVE YOU GOT THIS
SECOND SORT OF SLAM IN THE
OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH
SAYING THAT HE IS GOING TO
HAVE 25% TARIFFS ON
50 BILLION OF CHINESE GOODS.
WHAT'S THE CONNECTION OF ALL
OF THESE THINGS, LARRY?
>> WELL, LOOK, YOU KNOW, ONE
THOUGHT RIGHT NOW, HAVE YOU
GOT ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL
DISCUSSIONS, NEGOTIATIONS
AND COMMUNICATIONS.
VIRTUALLY ALL OVER THE
GLOBE.
I MEAN, YOU MENTIONED NORTH
KOREA AND SOCKET POMPEO
OPERATING THERE.
PRESUMABLY THE PRESIDENT
WILL BE OVER THERE IN
SINGAPORE IN A WEEK OR.
SO THERE IS A G-7 MEETING
COMING UP THERE ARE EUROPEAN
DISCUSSIONS WITH US ABOUT
TRADE.
THERE ARE NAFTA DISCUSSIONS
WITH US ABOUT TRADE.
THERE ARE CHINESE
DISCUSSIONS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A CHANGE
AGENT.
HE IS TRYING TO CHANGE A
NUMBER OF THINGS, YOU KNOW,
INCLUDING UNFAIR AND ILLEGAL
TRADING PRACTICES.
HE WANTS THE U.S. TO BE
TREATED FAIRLY.
HE WANTS RECIPROCITY.
HE WANTS PEACE AND
DENUCLEARIZATION ON THE
KOREAN PENINSULA.
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE
BREAST-TAKING DEVELOPMENTS.
>> Martha: INDEED THEY ARE.
>> I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THEY
ARE ALL FOR THE GOOD.
I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT
IS CONDUCTING HIMSELF IN A
TERRIFIC MANNER.
BY THE WAY, HE DOESN'T
ALWAYS PLAY BY THE NORMS OF
WASHINGTON.
>> Martha: WHICH IS WHY IT
IS SO FASCINATING TO WATCH.
HE DOES LINK TRADE WITH
POLICY IN A WAY THAT WE
TYPICALLY HAVEN'T SEEN.
SO MY QUESTION WAS, YOU
KNOW, DO YOU THINK THAT THE
TRADE NEGOTIATION WITH CHINA
IS A BASELINE FOR WHETHER OR
NOT CHINA IS GOING TO ALLOW
THIS NORTH KOREA TALK TO GO
FORWARD AND YOU JUST SAID
THAT YOU THINK HE WILL BE IN
SINGAPORE ON JUNE 12TH.
IS THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING
THEY BELIEVE THIS THING IS
BACK ON?
>> NOTHING IS DEFINITE.
SO I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD
OF THAT CURVE.
>> Martha: OKAY.
>> I THINK THE EXPECTATIONS
ARE VERY ENCOURAGING.
LOOK, CHINA TRADE DOESN'T
DEPEND ENCORE REA KOREA
DOESN'T DEPEND ON CHINA
TRADE.
I ACKNOWLEDGE THEY MAY BE
LINKED IN A GRAND LANDSCAPE
IF YOU WILL.
BUT THE CHINA TRADE, LOOK,
THE UNITED STATES NEEDS
CHINA TO GET RID OF THESE
UNFAIR AND ILLEGAL TRADING
PRACTICES.
WE CAN'T LET THEM STEAL OUR
TECHNOLOGY.
WE CAN'T LET THEM FORCE US
TO GIVE TECHNOLOGY OVER.
THEY HAVE TO DROP TARIFF
BARRIERS AND NONTARIFF
BARRIERS.
SOME PROGRESS IS BEING MADE.
WILBUR ROSS IS GOING TO BE
OVER THERE.
I THINK HE IS THERE NOW
CROSSING THE DATELINE.
PROGRESS MAYBE
PROGRESS HAYBE
PROGRESS HASBE
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE.
STEVE MNUCHIN MADE PROGRESS.
EMPHASIZED TO THE CHINESE AS
WE TOLD THEM IN
PERSON-TO-PERSON MEETINGS,
WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR
FAMILY JEWELS.
WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT
CRUCIAL, CRITICAL, STRATEGIC
TECHNOLOGIES, FOR EXAMPLE.
WE ARE GOING TO PUT IMPORTS
ON CHINA THAT MIGHT STEAL
THOSE TECHNOLOGIES.
I THINK THAT'S VERY
IMPORTANT.
WE ARE GOING TO DEMAND THAT
THEY CHANGE A LOT OF THEIR
POLICY IN RETROSPECT TO
INVESTMENT HERE IN THE
UNITED STATES.
THIS IS NOT NEW.
THE CHINESE HAVE HEARD THIS
BEFORE.
THEIR RESPONSE, BY THE WAY,
WAS QUITE MILD BECAUSE THEY
HAVE HEARD THIS BEFORE.
BUT, AGAIN YOU, TO GET
GROWTH, TO GET MORE AMERICAN
EXPORTS.
TO GET RECIPROCITY WITH
EUROPE.
TO GET BETTER TRADE DEALS
WITH CHINA.
IT WILL HELP AMERICAN JOBS.
IT WILL HELP AMERICA'S
EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES.
>> Martha: UNDERSTOOD.
I THINK IT IS FASCINATING TO
WATCH ALL THE DIFFERENT
AREAS WHERE SO MUCH WORK IS
BEING DONE.
I GUESS, HOW FAR OUT DO YOU
THINK A TRADE DEAL WITH
CHINA IS?
CAN YOU PUT AN APPROXIMATE
TIME FRAME ON IT, LARRY?
>> NO.
I WOULDN'T EVEN TRY.
I MEAN, THIS IS A LONG
PROCESS.
IT'S A LONG NEGOTIATION.
PARTS OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS
AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID
THERE WILL BE TIME WHEN HE
EMPLOYS TARIFFS AS
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM OR
MAYBE NEGOTIATING MECHANISM.
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN TARIFFS
WILL NOT BE USED.
THESE THINGS HAVE THEIR UPS
AND DOWNS THERE ARE CYCLES
TO THIS.
NO, I WOULDN'T WANT TO PUT A
DEADLINE ON THAT.
I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN
CONTINUE MAKING PROGRESS.
>> Martha: I'M SHORT ON
TIME.
I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION
TO ONE MORE THING.
ON NORTH KOREA, THERE IS A
STORY THAT THEY PLAN TO KEEP
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUT
OFFERING TO KEEP BURGER
CHAINS IN NORTH KOREA.
>> IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A
WINNER TO ME.
BUT I'M NOT RUNNING THE
STATE DEPARTMENT.
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
DENUCLEARIZATION IS A VERY
KEY PART OF THE U.S.
DEMANDS.
BURGER KINGS, FINE, THE MORE
THE MERRIER, I GUESS.
>> Martha: I COULD SAY WHY
IF YOU ARE IN NORTH KOREA
YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE A
FIVE GUYS ON THE CORNER.
>> NORTH KOREANS NEED FOOD.
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
THEY MIGHT GET SOME HELP
FROM US IF THEY DO
