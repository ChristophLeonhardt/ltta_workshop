Watch what happens when
one octopus attacks another.
See the one coming forward?
First, it makes
itself taller and it
changes from
camouflage to very dark.
Those seem to be social
signals that octopus
is saying, “I’m big, I’m bad,
and I’m going to
take your spot.”
And that’s a surprise because
octopuses are solitary
and there’s very
little evidence
that they communicate with
each other or change color
for any reason other
than camouflage.
U.S. and Australian
researchers captured a
number of these 
aggressive interactions
when they placed cameras on
the sea floor near Tasmania.
There are several
signals that an octopus
has that say,
“Look out, here I come.”
How many they use
at one time seems
to be related to the intensity
of the confrontation.
They can make
themselves look tall,
turn very dark,
climb on higher ground
and raise and spread
their mantle.
Most interactions are
low key and don’t involve
all these signals.
Even for octopuses,
sometimes discretion is
the better part of valor.
