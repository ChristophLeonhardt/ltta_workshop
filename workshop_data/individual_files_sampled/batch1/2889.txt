I think a good way to think about finding a new pair of glasses is to think about what style you want and then make sure they fit you can have super thin wireframes that look like they're more basic right or you can have really chunky folder frames so the thicker the frame is the more fashion statement it's going to feel if you choose a color that's like a tan brown gray tone maybe that matches your hair color that's gonna read pretty basic if you choose a bright color of course that's gonna read like a statement bold piece and of course there's like a bunch of in between there there really are no rules you want to wear what feels comfortable to you but some guidelines are that a rectangle type shape especially one that has a short length height which means from the top of the lens to the bottom like that that reads more basic every day something that has a deeper top to bottom like the frames I'm wearing whether they be round or rectangle or square those are gonna read like more of a fashion bolder piece you just have to do three really simple checks when you put the glasses on the first is your eyebrows it's okay if the top of the frame kind of touches them a little bit but don't let your eyebrows be inside the lenses the second thing is your cheeks you don't want the frames like resting heavily on your cheeks if you smile really big and they get pushed up on your face and they don't fit and then the last thing is your pupils and this is probably the most important piece you want to make sure that your pupil is in the center of the from left to right it obviously doesn't have to be directly in the center and it doesn't have to be in the center from top to bottom but if if your pupils are too close to the inside of the lens it's gonna look like all your features are scrunched up together in the middle of your face and you don't want that you've probably never been in a more exciting time as far as mints bags are concerned so really what we're seeing now are a lot of totes something we call a soft briefcase
