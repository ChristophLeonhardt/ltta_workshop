Martha: MY NEXT GUEST WENT FROM BEING BACKUP QUARTERBACK CONSIDERING RETIREMENT TO THIS YEAR’S SUPER BOWL MOST VALUABLE PLAYER LEADING THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES TO VICTORY OVER TOM BRADY AND THE AND HE IS SHARING HIS STORY AND HIS NEW BOOK "DELETED "HERE NOW EXCLUSIVELY ON "THE STORY" NICK FOLES. IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS FROM ME AND ALL THE PATRIOTS FANS. EVERYBODY RESPECTS WHAT YOU DID Martha: BELIEVE ME. YOU BELONG AN ELITE CLUB OF QUARTERBACKS WHO HAVE SUPER BOWL RINGS AND IT EVEN SMALLER CLUB WHO HAVE BEATEN TOM BRADY IN THE SUPER BOWL. YOU AND ELI MANNING. MY QUESTION FOR YOU, WHEN YOU WALKED IN THERE THAT NIGHT, DID YOU SENSE THAT THAT TEAM WAS VULNERABLE, THAT HE WAS VULNERABLE, THAT YOU COULD BEAT HIM AFTER THE HAND INJURY AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WEEK? IT WAS MORE SO JUST FROM WHAT I KNEW WE HAD IN THE LOCKER ROOM JUST WITH THE GUYS THROUGHOUT GOING AGAINST THE PATRIOTS, IF NOT THE GREATEST FRANCHISE OF ALL TIME, THAT’S WE WANT TO GO AGAINST. TOM BRADY, BELICHICK, THAT’S WE WANT TO FACE. WE WERE READY TO PLAY. Martha: AFTER SAY WHEN YOU GUYS WALKED OUT YOU COULD FEEL THE ENERGY. YOU COULD FEEL HOW PUMPED UP YOU GUYS WERE AND I WAS WORRIED FROM THE VERY FIRST SECONDS OF THE GAME. HE FAILED. SHORTLY LATER YOU TRY TO DO THE SAME THING AND YOU SUCCEEDED. IT DOES APPEAR THAT WAY. EAGLES FANS WILL PROBABLY USE IT, BUT NO, HONESTLY WE HAD THE FILLING SPECIAL IN THE GAME PLAN WEEKS PRIOR AND WE WERE GOING TO USE IT IN THE SUPER BOWL I WAY OR THE OTHER IN A JUST SO HAPPENED THAT THEY TRIED A PLAY A COUPLE PLAYS BEFORE WE DID AND IF ANYTHING IT REMINDED ME MAKE SURE I LOOK AT ALL THE WAY IN I DON’T THINK ANYBODY WILL EVER FORGET. MALCOLM BUTLER WAS NOT PUT IN THE GAME BY COACHELLA CHECK AND A LOT OF PATRIOTS FANS BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE REAL VULNERABILITIES FOR THEM THAT NIGHT. I NEVER REALLY WORRIED ABOUT LINE. A GREAT SKILL SET SO I GUESS YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED BUT AT THE SAME TIME I’M NOT REALLY IT RECOGNIZE THEIR COVERAGE AND TRUST MY RECEIVERS TO BEAT THEM, BEAT THEM OFF THE BALL, BEAT THEM IN THE ROWS AND I’VE GOT TO EXPECT TO PUT THE BALL ON THE MONEY EVERY SINGLE TIME AND THAT WAS MY MIND-SET IN THE GAME. HE’S A TREMENDOUS PLAYER AND WATCHING HIM ON FILM, HE WAS GOING TO BE A GREAT MATCHUP. Martha: YOU PLATE SO RELAXED AND SO SMOOTH. I WONDER YOU’VE HAD A LOT OF ADVERSITY AS YOU POINT OUT IN YOUR BOOK. THE SUPER BOWL. HOW DO YOU GET THERE? YOU SAY THERE’S TWO NICK FOLES AND YOU NEEDED TO SEPARATE THEM. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I THINK SOMETIMES WE GET AN I THINK MY IDENTITY HAS AN ATHLETE, YOU ARE TREATED BASED ON HOW YOU PLAY SEE YOU HAVE A GOOD GAME, SOMETIMES ARE TREATED BETTER. IF YOU HAVE A BAD NAME EVERYONE’S AFRAID YOU AND I THINK THAT EVENTUALLY WEARS ON YOU. YOU DON’T WANT TO BE TREATED AS WHAT YOUR STATS SAY. YOU WANT TO BE TREATED AS A PERSON IN DEALING WITH THAT THROUGHOUT MY CAREER AND FACING THAT BATTLE, THAT’S BEEN ONGOIN ONGOING. I THINK I FINALLY CAME TO THE CLIMAX IN ST. LOUIS WERE AFTER THAT SEASON I NEED TO STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT AND ULTIMATELY I BACK TO THE GAME BECAUSE IT SORT OF ENTRAPPED ME. I DIDN’T WANT TO TOUCH A FOOTBALL AND A TEXAS BOY, TOUCHING FOOTBALL THE FIRST DAY, IT’S REALLY HARD. YOU LOVE SOMETHING YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND ALL OF US ON THE YOU LOSE IT BUT THE JOY CAME BACK. I PRAYED ABOUT IT WITH MY WIFE AND A LOT OF TEARS A PLAY FOR OF THE GAME BACK. Martha: YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT GOD AND YOUR FAITH, HOW DOES THAT SUSTAIN YOU? I GAVE MY LIFE TO CHRIST AS A FRESHMAN AT MICHIGAN STATE. LIFE TO HIM UNTIL THAT YEAR. MILES AWAY FROM HOME FROM TEXAS AND IT WAS GOING THROUGH A LOT WITH FOOTBALL ONCE AGAIN AND WITH IT AND I WOULD SAY THAT THROUGH THE TRIALS, THROUGH THE UPS AND DOWNS, LEANING ON CHRIST, NEVER FOR PROSPERITY. I KNOW THAT WHAT I’M GOING THROUGH TRIALS GOD IS TRYING TO TEACH ME SOMETHING. A BIG THING THROUGHOUT MY CAREER WAS MY WIFE GETTING SICK WITH CLOSER TOGETHER. SHE’S RESILIENT, SHE’S AMAZING AND NOW SHE’S GOT A PLATFORM TO REALLY SPREAD AWARENESS. Martha: BEAUTIFUL FAMILY. NO DOUBT THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE REALLY GIVES YOU PERSPECTIVE. ABSOLUTELY. Martha: IN TERMS OF NEXT I EXPECT CARSON TO GET A FULL RECOVERY. HE NEEDS TO GET HEALTHY. HE’S GOING TO HAVE A GREAT CAREER. I’M EXCITED TO BE IN PHILLY FOR THIS NEXT YEAR AND BE A PART OF THIS TEAM. IT’S A GREAT ATMOSPHERE. QUARTERBACK EVER IN SUPER BOWL HISTORY THROUGH THAT. Martha: HE WIN A AND YOU COME BACK AND YOU COME BACK AND YOU’VE GOT THE RING AND YOU THINK YOU WILL BE BACK UP. CARSON ARGUABLY GOING TO BE THE MVP LAST YEAR. WE HAVE SUCH A STACKED QUARTERBACK ROOM. THE ROOM IS STACKED. OPPORTUNITY, JOE IS GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY. IT’S JUST A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION IN PHILADELPHIA. Martha: STICK AROUND, ONE SECOND BECAUSE OUR RESIDENT EVIL I DIDN’T WANT TO WEAR THE JERSEY AFTER THE SUPER BOWL BUT I DID IT. AND THERE’S JESSIE, JESSIE, YOU OWE ME BIG TIME NOW. THAT’S GREAT. ALTHOUGH THE AUDIENCE DOESN’T KNOW THIS, YOU TRY TO INJURE PICTURES, SHE PULLED SOME CABLES OUT AND TRY TO TRICK HIM. YOU HAVE TO BE AN ATHLETE, EVEN ONSET. CONGRATULATIONS. WE WILL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. YOU ARE AWFUL, BUT IT’S SO CHEAP. I JUST ASKED ONE QUESTION. THAT’S A TRUE PHILLIES FAN NOT WITH JESSE ON THE AWNING, YOU BROKE THE AWNING. YES AND THE POLE. HOW DID YOU GET UP THERE? I CAN’T TELL. I SPENT A LONG NIGHT IN JAIL THAT NIGHT. HE’S SUCH A NICE MAN, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SPREAD SOME OF THAT GOOD KARMA TO SOME OF THE OTHER EAGLES FANS? DID YOU HEAR IN THE OPENING STATEMENTS, SHE BLAMED MALCOLM BUTLER’S ACTIONS FOR THE LOSS? DON’T FORGET THE INJURED HAND. I NOTICED THAT, I CAN’T FAULT HER, SHE’S A PATRIOTS FAN. I TRIED TO HANDLE IT GRACEFULLY. BUT I LOVE OUR FAN BASE AND I
