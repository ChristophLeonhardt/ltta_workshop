earlier this week news broke of a tragic police related shooting involving an Australian woman who had called the cops to report a possible sexual assault in the alley behind her home now unfortunately when police arrived to the scene and she approached their car the cop in the passenger side of that car shot and killed her and the only thing that we know so far is that the police officer who was driving talked to investigators and said that they heard a noise that startled them which is why he opened fire now I give you that context because the commentary involving this story is different from the commentary that we typically see in police-related shootings or police involved shootings the cop in this case who opened fire is a Muslim and all of a sudden conservatives who are very Pro police are speaking out against this cop because he's Muslim at case-in-point Michelle Bachman she was at a gubernatorial event in Minnesota and she gave a 45-minute rambling speech and during this 45 minutes she wanted to touch on the story involving this shooting here's what she had to say there is concerns in st. cloud st. cloud now has about 16% Somali of the entire st. cloud population people were concerned in the Saint Cloud area about how their area was changing when Governor Dayton went to st. cloud his response was if you don't like it then you can leave that's what he said to a native-born Minnesotans this isn't about being mean to Muslims this isn't about being afraid of people with a different skin color this is about Minnesotans who are saying the state is changing all right so I'm setting this up for you guys she kind of starts off by saying that you know there's an issue in Minnesota more and more Selam Somali Muslims are moving in and people are really concerned about their safety and well-being then she gets to the the cop shooting that I mentioned earlier take a look that's what I saw in Congress that's what I see in Minnesota too many people who are being afraid of being called racist bigots Islamophobes I'm not afraid of it because what we have to do is talk about the truth of the problems that are going on in Minnesota look at Saturday night look what happened Saturday night in this state we had a man Muhammad nor who was an affirmative action hire by the hijab wearing mayor of Minneapolis Betsy Hodges we don't know exactly what happened we don't know all we know is that a beautiful 40 year old Australian woman thought she heard a sexual assault ongoing in the alley behind her home at Washburn and 51st Street in Minneapolis so she called 911 she was a brave woman she called 904 the from the news reports is that she ended up out in the alley she was wearing her pajamas so now I just think of this 911 got a phone call of a possible sexual assault a woman comes up to the driver's side of a police car in her pajamas you would think that the response of the police officers would be to protect the woman who was coming up to the side of the car she had no gun she had no weapon of any kind instead Mohammed Moore we know unholstered himself pulled out his gun violating protocol reached across the chest of his partner riding in the car and shot the woman through the window in her abdomen killing her I'm not I'm not condemning this police officer because I don't know but I do know in that culture the women are covered from head to hoe it head to toe and a woman in her pajamas standing out in the alleyway we don't know again why it happened but what I'm wondering is this will the question that the BCA is conducting will they ask cultural questions what was the motivation you see in Minnesota we we have been marinated in political correctness so long we do not even allow ourselves to think about cultural questions we're constantly condemned that we're guilty of white privilege and we're supposed to go through shaming classes because of our background and our heritage for Western civilization that's again where I say kudos to President Donald Trump if you haven't listened to his speech in Warsaw Poland listen to his speech he asked the right question he said will the West have the will to survive with her what I like just let the war begin there's just so much to comment on first of all I love how she's like we really gotta ask ask these Investing are they willing to ask you know the cultural questions okay so is it alright for us to ask the cultural questions of white police officers who shoot and kill unarmed black individuals who are literally running away from them not running toward them is it okay if we ask those cultural questions is that okay if we ask cultural questions about police officers who decide to shoot and kill 12-year olds who are playing with toy guns within two seconds of arriving on the scene no no we're not allowed to ask those questions those questions are uncalled for right but oh it happens to be one time where a Muslim cop shoots and kills someone who by the way should not be a cop who should be condemned who should not be in that position at all because he obviously is not fit to be a cop right and you should be criticized but instead of talking about oh this is an ongoing trend among cops throughout the country where unarmed people are shot and killed because they're overly paranoid they heard a noise got startled he opened fire immediately right that's the issue it's not because she showed up in her pajamas she's just literally pulling this out of her ass right she knows nothing a lot of us know nothing she didn't get shot and killed because she was wearing pajamas she got shot and killed because we have a problem was training police in the kind tree it's something that we've been arguing about and talking about non-stop for several years now but we can't ask cultural questions of white cops well like she might also been killed because this guy had a mental problem she might also have been killed for a number of reasons the priority should be are we gonna find out what happened right we do not need to drag it through this like he's a Muslim just listen to yourself it's like literally the first time conservatives are criticizing cops but they're not criticize god they're criticizing one cop because he happens to be Muslim once she throws in the hijab wearing mayor I mean that kind of a she puts almost too fine a point on head to hoe hat from head to hoe hash tag from head to hoe hash tag head to hoe I don't even know what that means I also can't take serious someone when in a sentence when they use the word pajamas there used to be a news outlet called pajamas media really yeah years also how could he see she was wearing pajamas if she was like through a door it was in a window it was late at night so that's the stuff is and then she says people who are afraid to be called racist I'm not afraid to be called racist we know it's like that it doesn't care is what you're called you're being super racist when you're saying xenophobia kind of affirmative action hire by the hijab wearing mayor ya know because and why cuz it reveals that when you see her you see her her job the tone of voice you're using the way you're using it the obvious reasons you're using is because when you take that you make a bunch of assumptions about her that are all negative and you're making generalizations in a negative light that's racism and the thing that frustrates me about this whole situation is now you're now you're setting a tone or setting people up to defend the cop right what the cop did was wrong the cop murdered someone the cop murdered an innocent unarmed person okay don't create a situation where people now have sympathy for what happened or for him like he should face consequences for what occurred but she immediately and it's funny because Jake and I jokingly mentioned and you know oh people are probably gonna handle this story differently or comment on this story differently because it's a Muslim cop but I didn't really think that was what was gonna happen and it happened it happened I guess I'm incredibly naive ya know it is weird it seems so clear cut but to bring the whole to use it as a platform to bring in the race argument and that that this religious integration of our community has to be looked at in some new way because you see what it's leading to it's a it's a wild pivot man and she made it it's crazy the cops are too scared they're they're driving around scared and by the way the media makes them even more scared right we elevate everything to to the level of every stop is going to lead into violence potentially and they they carry that with them and it echoes in their mind anyway on this point it's a crazy pivot she made crazy yeah she said it might have been a quote cultural seizure he had like epilepsy like I don't know what called medical condition the cultural seizures are yeah you have a culture and then this is a really great one where she says she talks about Trump and the vice presidents she describes them as regular guys who don't mind being called racist I just don't get that the whole to this and this is like they're regular guys because they say racist stuff like they're all that scene from Gran Torino like they're all kind of walking around being like it's cool and and trying to use racist statements as making you a regular person so they are trying to normalize racism they they want to wear it as like a badge of honor you know what I mean and it's it's it's super interesting because she also talks about white privilege and you can tell when that phrase is used it really gets under her skin and so it's interesting to see how she can say like oh people don't people are obsessed with political correctness they get offended so easily and then you just say white privilege and her head explodes right right yeah I don't know I'm white the phrase white privilege doesn't make me feel bad about myself right it makes me recognize an actual issue and it doesn't take anything away from me it doesn't mean that I haven't achieved anything on my own you know what I'm saying yeah and it's just like this fundamental misunderstanding of what that phrase means and it anyway if you like The Young Turks you love Young Turks membership TYT Network dot-com sighs join
