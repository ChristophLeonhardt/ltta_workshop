1
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,439
Every couple of years, there's a

2
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,000
magical cure-all beauty ingredient to
give you amazing clear glowing skin.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,720
Right now those ingredients are acids.

4
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,620
Acids to erase wrinkles, to smooth your

5
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,090
skin, to tighten your skin, to rid your
skin of pimples, to make your skin look

6
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,520
like glass.

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,219
But with a bunch of acids to
choose from, how are you supposed to know

8
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,260
which ones won't leave your face looking
like beef carpaccio?

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,899
This one says it's

10
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,949
for exfoliation, we've got something for
hydration, something for brightening, this

11
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,760
one refines the appearance of pore size,
skin texture, and fine lines.

12
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,520
Overwhelmed yet? I know I am. I
went to a dermatologist's office to get

13
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,500
some answers.

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,760
So chemical peels and skin
care acids are pretty much synonymous.

15
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,460
A peel is a procedure, so it's the notion
of taking off or peeling a layer of the

16
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,740
skin, but the acid is the actual tool
that we use.

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,000
Acids that you use in the

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,770
over-the-counter market are different
and weaker than the ones that we use in

19
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,740
the office for medical procedures.

20
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,600
The popular at-home acids are alphahydroxy,

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,500
betahydroxy, and for the sensitive skin
folks, polyhydroxy.

22
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,960
AHAs like glycolic

23
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,250
and lactic acid exfoliate the skin on
its surface removing layers of dead

24
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,650
cells and reducing the appearance
of acne scars, fine lines, and dark

25
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,520
spots.

26
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,780
BHAs or salicylic acid can go
beneath the skin surface to clean out

27
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,120
excess oil and has anti-inflammatory
properties.

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,610
Basically good for those who

29
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,220
are more acne prone.

30
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,040
PHAs are the gentler
acids used for exfoliation. They also

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,060
attract water molecules which then moisturize
 your skin. There are other

32
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,319
stronger acids like trichloroacetic acid,
but they're considered too dangerous for

33
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,340
at-home products and are only supposed
to be used by licensed professionals.

34
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,860
I am here today to get an acid peel of
some kind.

35
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,880
I guess I'm a little bit

36
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,129
nervous, because every time I've
mentioned to people that I'm going to

37
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:53,299
get an acid peel they remind me of
the infamous Sex in the City scene where

38
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,800
Samantha gets a peel and it's just like, her
skin is falling off of her face.

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,400
Hi, I've had a chemical peel. I'm Carrie's publicist.

40
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,840
The first

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,790
step is the pre-peel cleanser to remove
any remaining dirt, oils, or makeup. Next a

42
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,290
low strength glycolic acid is applied.
Now, this part is a mix of citric and

43
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,660
mandelic acid along with other
ingredients.

44
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,190
The last layer is trichloroacetic acid.
Using cotton swabs the doctor goes over

45
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,299
Ashley's problem areas. Face rinse
included, the procedure took less than 15

46
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:24,020
minutes.

47
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,800
I looked in the mirror and I was like,
whaaaaat.

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,880
Just feels so much brighter

49
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,820
and things that I just kind of thought
were freckles I guess are not freckles,

50
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,780
they're skin damage and they're gone!

51
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,290
So . I'm excited to see what happens to my

52
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,530
acne scarring, because I already feel
it's a little lighter so I'm pretty

53
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,080
excited to wake up tomorrow morning.

54
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,299
But depending on your skin, how much acid you

55
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:48,680
use, and the time it's left on, the side
effects can be less appealing.

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,180
If you use peels too much, whether it's at home or
in the office, it is not safe.

57
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,120
Excessive use of peels will weaken your skin. It's
gonna slowly peel off the top layer and

58
00:03:58,129 --> 00:03:59,840
make the skin thinner.

59
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,639
When you use
stronger acids without medical

60
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,220
supervision,
there's a higher risk of accidentally

61
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,900
giving yourself a chemical burn.

62
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,569
The FDA
in the cosmetic realm likes to put a

63
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:10,740
limit at about 10%.

64
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,790
Having said that, you
go on any website and you're gonna be

65
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,269
able to find percentages that are higher.
Again, if you're just starting out at this,

66
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,820
stick to a product that's around 10%.

67
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,600
Whether you use acids or not,

68
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,780
good skincare routines start with
prevention and protection.

69
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,500
The number one

70
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,180
rule is to wear sunscreen. Like, every day.

71
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,500
Although some people will see the

72
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,920
benefits in using acids —

73
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,900
— others won't.

74
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,780
We'll probably always be

75
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,100
fixated on how we present our faces to
the world, but if we aren't careful with

76
00:05:11,100 --> 00:00:00,000
the products we use, we risk our choices
coming back to burn us in the end.
