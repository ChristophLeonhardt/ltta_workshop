TIME.
CONTINUED SUCCESS AT THE
SINGAPORE SUMMIT THAT WILL
BE INTERESTING ONE.
FLY ON THE WALL.
PETE: THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA
OBSESSING, THAT'S A GOOD
WORD FOR IT, ABOUT THE FIRST
LADY'S WHEREABOUTS AND
TRASHING THE TRUMP WOMEN.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
WONDERING WHERE THE FIRST
LADY IS.
>> THE LAST TIME WE CAUGHT A
GLIMPSE OF HER WAS ON
MAY 10TH, 24 DAYS.
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED IT TOOK
THAT SHAWSHANK GUY YEARS TO
TUNNEL OUT.
>> THE TRUMP WOMEN ARE THEY
JUST THE MOST STOICK HUMAN
BEINGS?
ARE THEY NUMB AND DEAD
INSIDE?
GRIFF: RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY
IS HERE TO WEIGH IN.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU, RACHEL.
>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
ABBY: YOU ARE OUTSPOKEN
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP.
YOU ARE THE PERFECT PERSON.
>> I'M SOULLESS AND HELPLESS
AND CONTROLLED BY MEN.
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN HILLARY
WENT, I THINK, TO INDIA AND
SHE SAID THE REASON WHY
REPUBLICAN WOMEN VOTED FOR
TRUMP -- BY THE WAY A LOT OF
DEMOCRATIC WOMEN DID, TOO,
IS THAT THEY ARE CONTROLLED
BY THEIR HUSBANDS.
THEIR SONS AND THEIR BOSSES
TOLD THEM TO VOTE FOR TRUMP.
THIS IS THE MEDIA AND THE
DEMOCRAT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW THEY LOST THAT ELECTION.
AND IT HAS TO BE THAT WOMEN
ARE CONTROLLED BY MEN THAT
THEY ARE HELPLESS.
IN THE CASE OF MELANIA, THAT
SHE IS SOMEHOW A HOSTAGE IN
THE WHITE HOUSE.
THAT'S HOW THEY ARE
EXPLAINING IT AND, BY THE
WAY.
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE GOING TO
LOSE AGAIN IN THE MID TERMS.
PETE: RACHEL, IN A FAIR
WORLD, MELANIA TRUMP WOULD
BE SPLASHED OVER EVERY
FASHION MAGAZINE IN AMERICA.
INSTEAD, THE ONE MOMENT
WHERE SHE ISN'T IN THE
PUBLIC BECAUSE OF A SURGERY,
WHICH MOST OF US WOULD GIVE
DRERCHES TO, NOW THEY ARE
OBSESSING OVER THAT
COVERAGE.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THAT DOUBLE
STANDARD?
>> WELL, IT IS WHAT IT IS.
AND REPUBLICANS, ESPECIALLY
REPUBLICAN WOMEN AND
REPUBLICAN OR CONSERVATIVE
MINORITIES HAVE ALWAYS HAD
TO DEAL WITH THIS EXTREME
DOUBLE STANDARD.
IT JUST IS WHAT IT IS.
THEY WERE COMPLICIT.
WE BETRAYED OUR GENDER BY
NOT DOING WHAT THEY SAY THAT
WE SHOULD DO, FOR THINKING
FOR OURSELVES.
IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE IN THE
CASE OF MELANIA, IT COULDN'T
BE MORE UNTRUE.
FROM DAY ONE, THIS IS A
WOMAN WHO HAS DONE IT HER
WAY.
REMEMBER ALL THE PRESSURE
SHE HAD TO MOVE TO THE WHITE
HOUSE.
INAUGURATION AND SHE WAS
LIKE, YOU KNOW, THAT DOESN'T
WORK FOR ME.
I WOULD LIKE TO STAY HERE
AND BE WITH MY SON UNTIL HE,
YOU KNOW, FINISHES OUT THE
SCHOOL YEAR.
AND, AGAIN, WITH THE
SURGERY, YOU KNOW, SHE HAD
TO KNOW THERE WAS GOING TO
BE A LOT OF SPECULATION WITH
HER NOT BEING IN THE MEDIA,
AND SHE DIDN'T CARE.
SHE PUT HER OWN HEALTH
FIRST, WHICH SHE SHOULD AS A
WOMAN AND IGNORED ALL THE
NAYSAYERS AND HATERS.
GRIFF: QUICK PREDICTION, DO
YOU BELIEVE THIS WILL HELP
FIRST LADY MELANIA
ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS?
BECAUSE THEY'RE ROOTING
AGAINST HER AND EVERYBODY
LOVES AN UNDERDOG.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
SHE IS GRACEFUL.
SHE IS HANDLING IT
BEAUTIFULLY.
THE WAY SHE HANDLED IT
GIULIANI COMMENTING ON HER
MARRIAGE, SHE GAVE A VERY
ELEGANT, YOU KNOW, STATEMENT
SAYING I HAVE NEVER
DISCUSSED ANYTHING WITH HIM.
THIS IS A WOMAN WHO DOES IT
HER WAY IN A VERY ELEGANT
WAY THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE
RESPONDING TO.
THEY LOVE HER STYLE.
AND I THINK SHE IS QUIETLY,
DESPITE ALL THE NAY SAYERS
AND WINNERS WINNING OVER THE
HEARTS OF AMERICANS.
