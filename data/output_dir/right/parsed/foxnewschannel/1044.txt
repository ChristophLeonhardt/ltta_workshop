>>  AS SOUTH CAROLINA VOTERS
HEAD TO THE POLLS FOR TUESDAY'S
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, VOTERS ARE
TRYING TO FILL CONGRESSMAN TREY
GOWDY'S DISTRICT.
THERE ARE NO SHORTAGE TO CHOOSE
FROM.
CONGRESSMAN GOWDY SERVED FOUR
TERMS.
AND THERE ARE 18 CANDIDATES.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, I SAID
THERE ARE 18 AND THERE ARE
ACTUAL 12 REPUBLICANS AND 18
TOTAL CANDIDATES BECAUSE
OBVIOUSLY THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AS
WELL.
I'M SORT OF CURIOUS HOW
REPUBLICANS ARE DISTINGUISHING
THEMSELVES WHEN THERE ARE SO
MANY IN THE FIELD RIGHT NOW.
>> WELL, FIRST OFF, IT'S GOING
TO BE WITH YOU.
YOU SAID I'M NOT IN THE STUDIO,
BUT HERE IN THE GREATEST STATE
OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND THERE'S A
CROWDED FIELD AND 12 REPUBLICANS
REMAIN IN THE RACE.
WE TRY TO COMMUNICATE WHERE WE
STAND ON ISSUES AND IN THIS
DISTRICT YOU HAVE TO BE A
FISCAL, AND NATIONAL SECURITY
CONSERVATIVE AND THAT'S OUR
MESSAGE AND SEEMS TO BE
RESONATING AND THAT'S WHAT FOLKS
HERE BELIEVE IN AND WHAT THEY
GOT WITH TREY GOWDY.
ELIZABETH: HOW ARE REPUBLICANS
SETTING THEMSELVES APART?
I'M NOT MISTAKEN YOU HAD A TOWN
HALL FORUM ON WEDNESDAY.
SOME OF THE CRITICS WERE SAYING
EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO ALIGN
THEMSELVES CLOSER TO TRUMP.
THERE WASN'T A WAY TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE
CANDIDATES AND HOW ARE YOU DOING
THAT?
>> EVERY PERSON IS SUPPORTING
THE PRESIDENT AND I THINK ALL
REPUBLICANS IN THIS PRIMARY WANT
THIS PRESIDENT TO SUCCEED,
SUCCEED ON IMMIGRATION AND
SUCCESSFUL ON REDUCING THE
DEFICIT AND BRINGING DOWN THE
DEBT.
ALL OF US HAVE A DIFFERENT
SKILLSET AND EACH ONE OF US ARE
DRAWING CONTRAST, WHAT'S OUR
LIFE EXPERIENCE AND BUSINESS
EXPERIENCE?
WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO THIS POINT.
ANYBODY CAN SAY ANYTHING DURING
THE CAMPAIGN, YOU ALL KNOW THAT,
YOU SEE IT ALL THE TIME.
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO
COMMUNICATE, LOOK AT OUR RECORD,
LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE, WHAT
I'VE DONE AND WHY I'M BEST
QUALIFIED TO SIR OF THE FOURTH
DISTRICT IN CONGRESS AND
CONTINUING THE CONSERVATIVE
LEGACY.
ALL OF US AGREE WE'RE SPORTYIVE
-- SUPPORTIVE OF THE PRESIDENT
AND HOW CAN WE BEST BE THE ALLY
IN CONGRESS.
ELIZABETH: I'M CURIOUS AS TO
WHAT ISSUES YOU FOUND REALLY THE
MOST HOT BED OUT OF THAT
DISCUSSION ON WEDNESDAY.
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
IMMIGRATION?
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE
SAYING THE EFFECT OF TAX REFORM?
WHAT ARE THE SOUTH CAROLINAIONS
CONCERNED ABOUT ON TUESDAY.
IF THERE ARE 12 FOLKS, IT'S
GOING TO A RUNOFF UNLESS
SOMEBODY GETS 50% PLUS ONE AND
WITH 12 PEOPLE, IT'S HARD TO GET
TO 50%.
>> A RUNOFF, WE'RE PREPARING FOR
THAT.
THE TWO BIGGEST ISSUES PEOPLE
ARE WORRIED ABOUT IN SOUTH
CAROLINA, THE TRILLION DOLLAR
DEFICIT AND OPEN BORDERS.
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT, WHETHER I'M IN A DEBATE
OR A COFFEE SHOP.
HOW TO END TRILLION DOLLAR
DEFICIT.
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO GO FROM 20
TRILLION IN DEBT TO 40 TRILLION
IN THE NEXT TEN, 20 YEARS, AND
WE CANNOT AFFORD THAT.
PEOPLE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED
ABOUT FOR DECADES WE'VE HAD
VIRTUALLY AN OPEN BORDER POLICY.
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN
THE COUNTRY, UNAUTHORIZED, NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.
WE HAVE GANGS AND VIOLENCE
COMING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
BORDER.
PEOPLE ARE WORRIEDMENT WHAT DO
WE DO TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT, THE
DEBT AND GET CONTROL OF OUR
BORDERS AGAIN.
IF WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF OUR
BORDERS, WE'RE NOT REALLY A
COUNTRY.
ELIZABETH: THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT
NOT ONLY SOUTH CAROLINIANS ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT, BUT VOTERS
ACROSS THE NATION.
MY LAST QUESTION, YOU DID PICK
UP A MAJOR ENFORCEMENT.
WHAT GROUP IS NOW SUPPORTING YOU
AND HAS THAT PROPELLED YOU?
>> I'M THRILLED TO BE ENDORSED
BY CLUB FOR GROWTH.
THE SAME THAT SUPPORTED JIM
DEMINT AND TOM COTTON AND TED
CRUZ AND MIKE LEE AND THE GREAT
CONSERVATIVES FIGHTING ON
CAPITOL HILL EVERY DAY.
I CAN'T BE--
I'M SO THANKFUL TO BE IN THE
COMPANY OF THOSE CONSERVATIVE
GIANTS AND THANKFUL FOR THE
GREAT WORK THAT CLUB FOR GROWTH
HAS ENGAGED IN PROVIDING LIMITED
GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM
AND I'LL BE TRUE TO THAT
