while some Republicans are obviously standing by Trump there are others who say it's time to change things my next guest former New Jersey governor christine Todd Whitman served in the Bush 43 cabinet as EPA Administrator and she is now calling formerly on Donald Trump to resign she makes out her case in a new piece where she says Trump is unfit to be President and she's calling on her fellow Republicans to quote put aside the GOP label as hard as that may be and demonstrate the leadership our country needs by calling on this president to step down chris christine Todd Whitman joins me this is your first interview since this piece came out I appreciate you coming to the beat with it no pleasure good to be here what moved you to state this now the behavior has been been building the erratic behavior of the president but particularly the way he handled the meeting in NATO and the European Union and then the meeting with Putin I'm sorry when you dis our allies in the way that he did treat them the way he did and then you cozy up to somebody like Vladimir Putin who was not our friend he is not going to be our ally and he to my mind really forgot his oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic and frankly Putin is somebody with whom you've got to deal very strongly and you cannot assume that he is going to be your friend do you think that conduct which took you to this position mm-hmm reflects bad judgment on the part of Donald Trump or potentially something worse certainly bad judgment without a question there's bad judgment there whether it's anything worse or not I think we'll find out over time but you know it's hard to know what this president because it changes so that every day and within a day you'll get two or three times you get a different story and a different take on things coming out of the White House itself so it's hard to know where there's anything more behind it rather than just bad bad judgment and the fact that he likes strong men I mean we know that he likes Kim jong-un and thinks he's a great guy I mean here's somebody who offs half his family and and anybody who disagrees with him Putin is the same way the kinds of things he's done I just got back Saturday from the Republic of Georgia not our state of Georgia but overseas and you see there I was doing a pre-election mission there and you see the heavy hand of Russia always in the background I mean they're not playing in this election as much as they have in past ones but the kinds of things that we're seeing today they fake news the influence that they're that they're peddling the fear-mongering that they're doing it's very reminiscent of what we see happening in this country and it's very very disturbing if you care about the United States of America you're a former Republican elected official mm-hmm I am the party has long touted itself on national security on service on loyalty to the United States mm-hmm what do you think when you see this Republican president and his allies say even if they did collude with Russia to impact the election that's not a crime I find it extraordinarily offensive I mean frankly I don't care whether it's a crime in the criminal code book or not it is against the best interests of the United States you do not collude and for a president to get up there and say you know well maybe I didn't of course we again with the story has changed right along there first there was no collusion and well it doesn't matter if I did or not it does matter and words matter that's the other thing about what happened in over there in Europe it's the words that he uses the language that he uses that confuses people that undermines our country as a world leader that has now I started to isolate us and we're gonna need allies they're important we've worked with them before we need them and Putin is never going to be our ally neither as Kim jong-un your counterpart Chris Christie you both held the same post Republican governor of New Jersey he once claimed to be a moderate he has been very loyally defending Donald Trump what happened to Chris Christie well I mean I think he I'd know Chris well enough to think that he believes now what he is what he's saying and he is a supporter of the of the Republican President and I think it goes that far and I think at some point he was hoping for a little higher position than he's been able to get there but even so he nothing nothing yes I think I think it he has no position but also it's because he's a loyal Republic I mean there are people who will tell you that well some of the emails that have gotten and tweets and that posting since that op-ed have been a matome anatomically challenging shall we say but the language used which is really too bad well it's seventy thirty in favor versus against but and there have been a few of those who are against who are thoughtful whose positions I understand I get it I respect them the rest of them it's just the kind of language you wouldn't let your fifth-grader use right and when we worry so much about bullying in our schools and the outcome of that I think we've got the world's number one bully at the head of the country not good not good for us long term governor Whitman you're speaking to some of the reaction you've got and I know a lot of other people have been heartened by this at a time where what's happening in this country has raised questions about who will stand up so it was very interesting to see your piece I really appreciate you coming on the beat to talk about it hey I'm aria Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our youtube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
