WHICH LEAVES THEM WONDERING WHAT ELSE THEY DON'T KNOW. I'M SURE WE'LL BE COVERING IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THE REPORT TOTALLY EXONERATES HIM. LET'S BRING IN TONIGHT'S PANEL. FORMER ADVISOR TO BILL CLINTON. AN INTERESTING PIECE THAT YOU GUYS MAY HAVE READ, ANDY MCCARTHY, HE'S BEEN WRITING ON THESE ISSUES FOR MONTHS. BASICALLY, HE SAID IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE COMMON SENSE TO HIM THAT THE IG WALKED US THROUGH EVERYTHING. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN WERE JUSTIFIED. THEY WERE REASONABLE. HE WRITES THAT'S JUST NOT COMMON SENSE. YOU CAN'T LOOK AT THINGS IN A VACUUM. AND OF COURSE THEY'RE CONNECTED. WHAT DO YOU SAY, MARK? WELL, I THINK THE INSPECTOR GENERAL APPLIED A STANDARD OF JUSTIFICATION FOR EVERYTHING THAT WAS DONE AND HE CONCLUDED THAT THERE BY AND LARGE WAS A JUSTIFICATION. NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THE REPORT WITH THE SAME STANDARD THAT HE USED BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU REALLY HAVE TO READ THE WHOLE REPORT TO SEE THE FACTS HERE AND THE CULTURE OF BIAS THAT WAS UNDERNEATH HIS FINDINGS. WHEN IT COMES TO PETER STRZOK, HE DOES SINGLE STRZOK OUT AND SAY, WHEN IT COMES TO THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION HILLARY COMES OUT OF THIS PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE HE BASICALLY SAID THAT INVESTIGATION WAS JUSTIFIED AND IS BASICALLY OVER. I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO REPEAT THAT. BUT TRUMP ALSO COMES OUT OF THIS PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME REAL BIAS GOING INTO THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY SAYS MOST QUESTIONS PERTAIN TO THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE INVESTIGATING. AND THE IMPLICATION IN SOME OF THESE TEXT MESSAGES WAS THAT STRZOK MIGHT BE WILLING TO TAKE OFFICIAL ACTION TO IMPACT A CANDIDATE'S PRESIDENTIAL PROSPECT. DOES IT LEAVE A DOOR OPEN FOR YOU? I THINK THE BIGGEST THING I LEARNED IS THAT WE FAILED TO REMEMBER SOME BASIC THINGS, THAT THE VERY TOP PEOPLE AT THE FBI, THE DIRECTOR AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WERE FIRED, THAT THESE OTHER AGENTS THAT ARE REFERRED TO IN THE IG REPORT HAD VERY SENIOR POSITIONS IN THE FBI AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY AGGRESSIVE BY INJECTING POLITICS INTO ALL OF THESE DECISIONS, SHANNON. AND I THINK WHAT REALLY STRUCK ME BY READING BOTH PIECES IS THAT THERE WAS THAT ONE TWEET OR EXCUSE ME, THAT ONE MESSAGE, WHEN TED CRUZ DROPS OUT AND THERE'S THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT, "OH, NOW WE'VE REALLY GOT TO GET SERIOUS ON THE MIDTERM REVIEW AND WE'VE GOT TO STOP TRUMP." SO WHAT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION WAS NEVER REALLY AN INVESTIGATION. IT WAS NEVER REALLY ABOUT FINDING WRONGDOINGS. IT WAS ABOUT THE POLITICS OF STOPPING TRUMP. AND WHERE I DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT IS IT'S THE POLAR OPPOSITE WHEN IT COMES TO HILLARY. IT WAS ABOUT CLEARING HILLARY SO SHE COULD STOP DONALD TRUMP. IT WAS ALL ABOUT GETTING TRUMP. AND TRUMP CALLED IT FOR WHAT IT WAS. AND I CAN SEE WHY HE FEELS LIKE THIS REPORT MAKES THE WHOLE IDEA OF HAVING A SPECIAL COUNSEL PRETTY SILLY. BEN SHAPIRO WRITES THIS. I'M NOT MAKING THE CASE THAT THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY, BUT IT IS OBVIOUS FROM THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE THAT ONE FELT THE NECESSITY TO STOP TRUMP FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT. AND THE LEADING ACTORS INSIDE THE FBI ASSUMED HILLARY WOULD BE PRESIDENT AROUND TAILORED THEIR ACTIONS BASED ON THAT ASSUMPTION. THE IG GOES BEFORE THE SENATE AND HOUSE ON MONDAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'LL GET ASKED? DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO SAY, NO BIAS, NO BIAS. WASN'T THIS REASONABLE? IT WAS REASONABLE. REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO DO EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE AND SAY, HOW COULD YOU SAY THIS IS REASONABLE? HE'S GOING TO PLAY IT RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S GOING TO GET AN ADVANTAGE, EXCEPT HE REALLY SLAMS COMEY. AND SO I THINK WE COULD REALLY EXPECT HIM TO BE CONSISTENT. THE ACTUAL STORY OF COMEY HIDING WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS INCREDIBLE. I COULDN'T EVEN WRITE THAT FOR A MOVIE SCRIPT, THAT HE'S GOING TO RUSH TO THE MICROPHONE, NEVER TELL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO HE REPORTS TO. THAT IS MORE THAN INSUBORDINATION. YEAH, AND I THINK THE OTHER POINT IT MAKES IS THAT FOR ALL THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE BEEN SAYING SOMEHOW THE FBI IS OVER HERE ISOLATED BY ITSELF, IT REALLY REMINDS EVERYONE THAT THE FBI REPORTS TO THE DOJ, WHICH REPORTS TO THE PRESIDENT TRUMP OF THE UNITED STATES. IT IS CALLED THE EXECUTIVE
