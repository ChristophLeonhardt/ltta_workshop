her on<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube and she one of her main</font>

73
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,740
things with her regimen is oil rinsing

74
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,238
and I've really gotten into that

75
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,000
especially during my wash and gos just

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,010
using oil just to seal it in real quick

77
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,300
while you're in the shower under the

78
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,980
water and like kind of rinsing the oil

79
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,870
through your hair so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it's not</font>

80
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite so greasy because I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

81
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">like my hair feeling greasy and heavy so</font>

82
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,550
oil rinsing is a good way to get the

83
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,100
nutrients of it without like the grease

84
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,500

85
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,940
