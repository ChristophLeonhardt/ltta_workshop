Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has been getting a lot of press lately she is the congressional candidate who won the primary against an establishment Democrat in the state of New York and she ran a very bold democratic socialist campaign now the smears have begun from those on the right wing and some people on the left as well which we've talked about in the past but recently I was on HLN debating someone from the right wing a conservative by the name of Allie Stuckey she's the host of something known as the conservative review and she made a lot of errors in describing what democratic socialism is so first for anyone who might not know what it is I was asked what democratic socialism is and I answer in this next video so take a look so Anna some might say that means free stuff for everyone well that's the way that individuals want to defame Democratic socialists as if everyone's looking for a handout but in reality what we're looking for and I do also identify as a Democratic Socialist is equality of opportunity and also a guarantee of what we believe are fundamental rights for human beings including complete coverage of health care education you know the the basics to survive no one's looking for the government to make our sneakers we're not looking to overthrow a capitalistic system but we are looking to reform it because right now the majority of the wealth the majority of the income is really focused and targeted toward the top one percent everyone else is suffering including the middle class which continues to shrink under the Trump administration that's nearly a perfect answer okay you're kind of awesome so I want everybody understand because I further context now that we're not on TV and we could have more time to talk right is that first of all the whole thing's a misnomer because all signs use the word socialism without ever defining it and and the reality is that almost all the Western countries live in a mixed economy so though there's only questions around the edges and and the most of those are settled for almost all the countries except us so what do I mean by that so are there things that the public sector does in every country including America of course there are there cops there's the military there's firefighters and and so many other things that the government does so it's not like private capital does everything now in the rest of the developed world the government also provides healthcare so that's part of equality of opportunity that Ana was referring to because if you're dead you don't have any opportunity so most civilized countries say we should have at least a bare minimum standard for health care for our citizens we don't we're more vicious but we still live in a mixed economy okay and in and in Europe they don't have the government make furniture there's a I don't know if you've heard of a store called IKEA okay that's in a very socialist country in Sweden and the government doesn't make meatballs and they don't make furniture it's a mixed economy so what democratic socialists are saying in this country is we should also do health care like the rest of the Western world the rest of the civilized world and not just the West but Japan and all these other countries that have had great success and have much better health care for their citizens at a lower cost and the only other thing really that's a major factor is do you do free college and and there's been great success with countries that have done free college it actually stimulates the economy it creates more jobs etc now so we're having this totally fake debate in the national media about are your socialists or are you not a socialist or cap you know why I mean look I think that there are there is a group of people who intentionally mislead the American people about what democratic socialism is they try to paint this picture of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara you know doing a violent revolution and murdering people and basically having the government control everything with absolutely no private sector that is not what Democratic socialists want okay let's make that absolutely clear and and then they're the honestly idiots who fall for that propaganda and unfortunately I had to push back against that propaganda in in this entire segment that you know I was participating in now I'm really happy that we at least had that conversation and hopefully it informed some people but I do want to go to the next video because it'll give you a sense of how much that propaganda has managed to seep into the minds of so many Americans take a look first of all Democratic Party has moved much further to the lessons 1990 that's not an opinion you can look at Pew Research on virtually every single issue since 1990 the entirety of the Democratic Party has moved to the fact where as a Republican to state about the same so it's just not true to say that this is some kind of reform going back to the original purpose of the Democratic Party the fact of the matter is is that they're putting socialist candidates out there and socialism has not worked you can tell me democratic socialism is different it's not true it's just socialism that you choose it is not possible to maintain a capitalist society in which the government takes over the means of production it doesn't work it hasn't worked in the past it doesn't work now there are hundreds of millions of dead and buried people that can attest to the danger of socialism and communism it so fused a few if you hate no you are confusing democratic socialism I'm not socialism no one is looking to overthrow a capitalistic system I believe in capitalism but what we have right now is crony capitalism and the American people in general that includes Republicans are sick and tired of it if you look at the approval rating for Donald Trump's massive tax cuts for corporations even among Republicans the approval rating has dropped considerably because people have noticed already benefiting the top one percent not the American people wages remain stagnant and by the way a federal judge that was appointed by Bush by Bush just struck down the zero tolerance policy under the Trump administration indicating that yes the right wing has moved further to the right so look this is what they do they go on TV unless there's someone like Anna who's gonna fight back and now let her steamroll them they just go oh socialism means you take over means of production that's what democratic socialism means that's not true not remotely true okay and it means millions of dead people okay first of all again all these words everybody puts different meaning on them okay so I guess she's referring to communism and okay so Stalin takes over communism and I don't believe in communism at all and and he takes it over and then there's millions of dead people well right next door was Hitler who did fascism which is a combination of the corporate world with the government and millions of dead people so two can play at this game so let's talk about what we're actually for the policy positions today not your fantasies so the policy positions are the ones we just outlined and her every one of her claims was wrong every single one Democratic Party has moved way to the left since the 1990s look at the polls those are facts no no no wait a minute if you're talking about the polling of the American people yes the polling shows not just Democratic voters almost all the voters have moved to the left now the politicians don't listen to them but the voters have moved to the left they say yeah I do want Medicare for all yeah that's 60 percent yes I do want to legalize marijuana yes I do want a higher minimum wage no I do not want to let the banks take all those risks and run roughshod over us and it goes on and on but our Democratic politicians moving to the left no until Bernie Sanders and Alexandra krauser Cortes they were massively moving to the right they're a pro corporate because they take corporate donations to complain that they're leftists or socialists she's preposterous she had mentioned Cory Booker in this exchange we can't show you the full video because it's like 11 minutes long but she described him as like far left a radical leftist Cory Booker Farlow come on girl air Hitler like you you better come correct like do your research if you're gonna make these types of claims like and that's the thing I've been on this show several times I love doing the show it at least gives me an opportunity to get progressive ideas out there in the mainstream media right but I always try to be respectful because I don't like crosstalking I don't like talking over people but what did I tell you guys I'm done being nice done being mrs. nice woman or whatever you know I want to fight back we can't keep letting them run with their narrative and control the messaging out there because that's what's happening time and time again people literally think that we want the government to take over everything I can tell you this I do not want the government making the clothes I wear okay I don't want the government deciding what car I Drive I don't want the government doing any of that but what I do want is to ensure that Americans have the bare necessities to survive and by the way you know she talks about how America is the number one country in the world right we're number one I have the stats to prove that that is not the case but yeah so I just wanna say two things one look unlike that person we actually do study the facts and talk about it on the show so when we say Cory Booker's nowhere near leftist there's a reason why we say that for example in 2012 when Obama was running against Mitt Romney and Obama criticized I mean he just lightly tweaked Wall Street Cory Booker rushed onto TV and defended Mitt Romney on Wall Street and that's supposed to be the leftist Democrat he's like well I think it is really unfair to talk about those the people in the financial industry that way and I really wish I Obama wouldn't do that why cuz they're his donors so that's why a lot of progressives don't trust Cory Booker to claim that he's some sort of wild-eyed leftist is hilarious and it shows you've done no research whatsoever right and look people this could have legitimate debates about how much worker control should there be over companies for example a really interesting model is in Germany where they have their boards are half labor and and half the investors and and management right well guess what Germany has an incredibly stable economy that is really successful I don't even know if I'm in favor of that but I think that's an interesting intelligent conversation to have instead of oh you're gonna kill millions of people that's what socialism is for I mean what a bunch of simpletons okay so let's go to the next video because this was my personal favorite take a look do we want to start paying you know close to a hundred percent in income taxes like scandal yeah country's at Bernie Sanders is it has said that he's actually actually loved it wants to model our country after and I'm like thank you I think any other unbelievable you know one is asking for one half that says you are painting a completely false narrative or picture of what those on the Left are asking for is a picture of socialism if you can point to don't have a dream about race just assuming things assuming things you can yes you already view you can look at the countries who have actually done socialism as well okay yeah sorry I I know I know but I have the data I really want to get to the data really quickly before okay first of all no one is asking for 100 percent taxation I said that in that clip and I'm saying it again Bernie Sanders never said he wanted to tax people at 100 percent it's preposterous ridiculous it's the most insane thing you've ever heard they say insane things and then when you say that's not true they're like what wait why are you being uncivil I was just saying you're that Democrats for a hundred percent taxes we think about how monstrously stupid that is yeah okay she just says it with a straight face so let's get to Scandinavian countries because she talks about how oh my he wants us to be like the Scandinavian countries they're so terrible except they're not they're actually much better than us when you look at various issues like so first let's start with life expectancy because that's important right yeah do Americans live longer lives than those people who are living in those horrible Scandinavia of course we're number one except we're not if you compare us the Scandinavian countries were last Sweden life expect this is based on the World Health Organization Sweden a standard or average life expectancy is eighty two point four years Norway eighty one point eight years Finland eighty one point one years Denmark eighty point six years and in the United States seventy nine point three years okay great so what about graduation rates for high school or a secondary education Finland is number one which is unsurprising because they have awesome education they're 99 percent Denmark 92 percent Norway 87 percent United States all the way down there at eighty three percent now Sweden doesn't do as well as we do but I mean if you compare us to other Scandinavian countries we're not number one we're not the best okay just one quick note on Finland they do not allow for private schools and in America that's an in Assam okay they're like no although socialist you have to privatize all the schools they'll never have any success ninety nine percent graduation rate not only that they test the very best out of all the countries in the world in almost every category it turns out public schools work Oh socialism those public schools are what made this country great so let's look at poverty rates okay so when it comes to poverty only five point five percent of the population is living under the poverty line in Denmark in Finland at six point three percent in Norway 8.1% sweet and nine percent and then would you look at that the United States 16.8% we ranked 34th out of 36 countries I mean in terms of yes but women like that they don't care they're like oh that's poor people I don't keep I told you I don't care about poor people if they're suffering so what I don't I don't want to live in a scandi Scandinavian country where we actually care about other human beings well that's okay I get that part you know one last thing that I loved about your appearance there is that I I know the Republican strategy and they tell their people that go on TV this filibuster because those TV segments are really short so talk for as long as you possibly can so that Jeff Weaver gets less time who's Bernie Sanders campaign manager that was also on that Ana Kasparian they probably didn't even take you into account which was a mistake okay so that's why it's important for people on the left to be strong and say no we're not gonna let you get away way of saying things that are provably wrong and by the way hilarious if you did a hundred percent taxes you would literally have no money and we're not gonna let you get away with filibusters so that's what strength looks like two easy ways for the young turks want us hit the
