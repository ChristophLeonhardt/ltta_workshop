00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,140
The internet loves cats, but did you know
the print on the cats nose has a unique

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,799
rigid pattern just like a fingerprint?
Or that catnip really is like a

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,799
drug for cats?  One of its volatile
oils called nepetalactone enters

4
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,209
the cats nasal tissue and acts like an
artificial cat pharamone.  The sensory neurons are

5
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:19,740
stimulated and ultimately trigger a
behavioral and sexual response in the

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,019
brain and body in around 80%
of cats.  Which must be nice considering

7
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:27,960
cats spend around 85%
of their day doing absolutely nothing.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,650
Drinking, eating, defecating and even
mating only take up about 4%

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,880
combined.  But when they are moving, they
always seem to land on their feet.  This

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,230
is because of something called the
"Righting Reflex".  Not only do cats have very

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,110
sensitive motion and gravity sensing
abilities allowing them to determine

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,700
which way is down, they also have an
extremely flexible backbone and no

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,570
collarbone.

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,250
By bending in the middle and using fast
twitch muscle fibers they can whip

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,990
around without ever changing their net
angular momentum.  And did you know that

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,110
when a cat lifts its tail while being pet
it's really inviting you to smell it's

17
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,079
behind?

18
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,660
Cats use sent to communicate and this
exposes glands and pharamones holding

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,940
their signature smell.  A nice alternative
to a hug or a handshake.  They also

20
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,570
rub up against you to spread these
pharamones.  The glands on their face, tail and

21
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,690
body help them to claim you with their
sent, while also leaving nearby cats

22
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,040
signals about their identity, sexual
availability and territory.  On the other

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,220
hand, cats bury their poop in an
attempt to hide its smell.  This evolutionary

24
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,010
instinct is not only to avoid attracting
predators

25
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,880
but to show that they're submissive to a
dominant cat in the wild.  In the case of

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,689
your house, this is your cats way of
recognizing you as dominant.

27
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:38,810
Also in complete darkness cats can't
actually see, though they can see much

28
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,479
better than you and I in dim light. Cats have a layer of cells behind the

29
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,340
retina called the "Tupetum Lucidum"
which acts like a mirror reflecting extra

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,549
light back at the retina.  In near darkness
this gives their eyes a second chance to

31
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,909
pick up more light, but without any light
present they can't see anymore than we can.

32
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:58,179
And if you ever see a cat with three
distinct colours, often called a Calico

33
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:02,090
or Tortoise Shell cat you can bet it's
female.  The fur colour gene is located on

34
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,310
the "X" chromosome.  This means females can have two colours in addition to white

35
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,508
because they have two "X" chromosomes.
 The male "Y" chromosome, on the other hand,

36
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:14,180
does not have any colour genes, as a
result males will generally only have

37
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,999
one colour along with white

38
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:20,359
though in rare genetic cases it is possible for
them to have more.  Interestingly we still

39
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:23,799
don't really know why cats purr.  In fact
cats purr both during pleasurable

40
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:27,799
situations but also while they're
in duress or injured.  While many believe

41
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,509
it's a means to communicate passivity or
pleasure,

42
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,139
one interesting theory suggests that the
frequency that purrs occur at 

43
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,319
(24 - 140 Hz) promotes healthy
bone growth and healing.  Because cats have

44
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,869
adapted to a lifestyle with frequent
rest and sleep, this may be a low

45
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:45,329
energy mechanism to promote muscle and
bone health.
