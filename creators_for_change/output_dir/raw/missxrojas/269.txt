00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,990
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> blogging from the top of my</font>

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,180
sisters flat it's really really nice up

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,560
here never been to Madrid support I've

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,510
never visited her before even know her

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,130
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> her husband and her two kids have</font>

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,870
lived here for<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite a while now so it's</font>

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,639
really nice to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> here it's like 27</font>

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,619
degrees it's something like 8pm still

10
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,930
completely warm and beautiful and

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,400
amazing and you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start of the</font>

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">sunset behind me and it's so so cool so</font>

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,900
today my nephew who's three years old

14
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,570
told me that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I were a ninja turtle I</font>

15
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,060
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raphael and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I take this more</font>

16
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,980
seriously than I would ever take like my

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,110
horoscope or anything so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked enough</font>

18
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,850
and I looked at you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the character</font>

19
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,890
traits that most closely align here

20
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,739
align me in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> nephew's mind to Raphael</font>

21
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,930
so Raphael is most likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

22
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,789
extremes of emotion he's usually

23
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,750
depicted as being aggressive sullen

24
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,250
maddened this is all I like rebellious

25
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,500
because no word has probably described

26
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,510
me less in my like teenage years as

27
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,160
rebellious and my childhood years it was

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,379
pretty afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of making people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unhappy</font>

29
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,329
like pissing people off but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might</font>

30
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,890
about years a little bit more rebellious

31
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would say my rebellion has really come</font>

32
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,700
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think they do talk to you soon</font>

33
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,350
you know not that I wasn't Gryffindor

34
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,060
from the start but still it just goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

35
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,650
show things you really align yourself

36
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,270
with the teenager don't necessarily mean

37
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,760
you're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of life sentence massage</font>

38
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,900
description<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that there's anything</font>

39
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,000
wrong one we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to leesburg so there's</font>

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,890
anything wrong with like sticking to the

41
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,479
rules or anything the origin of

42
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,250
Raphael's anger is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fully</font>

43
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,229
explored but and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the Time Lord</font>

44
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,340
aspect of it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> some ink</font>

45
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,140
appears<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stem partly from the</font>

46
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,060
realization that they're the only

47
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,679
creatures of their kind and are

48
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:34,750
ultimately alone he also has a somewhat

49
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,189
turbulent relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> with his older</font>

50
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:37,659
brother Leonardo because he's the group

51
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,700
leader sounds yummy belly this is the

52
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,100
best part of it so as I say something I

53
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,149
didn't really embrace when I was younger

54
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:45,069
but I'm racing now so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask you</font>

55
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:46,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys what did you not embrace me the</font>

56
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">younger in your embrace now and then</font>

57
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:50,319
second that which ninja turtle would you

58
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,759
identify with and which do you think

59
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,340
other people would say you were if you

60
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,450
had to pick I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to leave you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

61
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,909
a beautiful view of Madrid at nine

62
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,039
forty-three p.m. it's still so warm and

63
00:02:00,039 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys later bye</font>
