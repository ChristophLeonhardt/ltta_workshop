now threatening to quit his new CEO job

global outrage over the 20-plus billion

shell out to his employees a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ago you'll remember Lloyd made be</font>

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,540
classic remark that Goldman Sachs is

doing God's work everyone should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font>

proud of Goldman for saving the world

they're helping companies get money so

32
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,729
back off with the criticism of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Goldman</font>

tack a little bit after being globally

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,180
ridiculed for that he is now saying that

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,890
Goldman Sachs employees are more

37
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">productive than any on the planet</font>

38
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,680
therefore they deserve their bonuses

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,350
hard to be a taxpayer and not hear that

40
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,790
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Goldman Sachs's</font>

41

employees are better than you we have

some advice for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lloyd just stop talking</font>

paying out 20 billion dollars in bonuses

45
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:05,219
we're used to that in another<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,090
Geithner remember about a year ago how

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,920
all he was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about was saving the</font>

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,680
world now he's back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talking about how</font>

he<font color="#E5E5E5"> is interested in a strong dollar this</font>

55

is the perpetual line from Treasury

<font color="#CCCCCC">secretaries they're always interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

57

maintaining a strong dollar they never

actually mean it because that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

59
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,430
actually threaten the economy in many

60
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,350
ways or certainly bring the Treasury

61
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,960
under criticism but Tim Geithner now has

62
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,150
enough time of it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> his hands to start</font>

63
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,040
reassuring people that he wants a strong

dollar number to sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are coming</font>

65
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,560
out of a recession at light speed

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,720
yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> a jury acquitted the Bear</font>

67

Stearns hedge funds defendants on all

68
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,120
counts we would suggest that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,980
because they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in fact commit</font>

70
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,660
fraud we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been reading the evidence</font>

71
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has made its way to the papers</font>

72
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,870
nothing that we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggests that</font>

73
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">they actually did commit fraud the</font>

74
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,320
government brought the suit they believe

75
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,450
they did commit fraud but now the talk

76
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,030
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about how the government did such</font>

77
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,770
a horrible job<font color="#CCCCCC"> of preventing the case</font>

78
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,780
maybe it's just that they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> commit</font>

79
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,570
fraud but in any event six months ago it

80
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">is almost certain that a jury would have</font>

81
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,980
convicted anybody in a suit who worked

82
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,860
on Wall Street of anything now the jury

83
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,209
seems to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen it the correct way</font>

84
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the number one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why we are</font>

85
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,870
coming out of a recession or sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

86

we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out of recession day</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">traders the perpetual chumps of the</font>

88
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,680
stock market are making money again

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,020
those etrade ads that you see every

90
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,410
weekend urging you to stop and abandon

91
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,390
your professional managers and abandon

92
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,160
your index funds and take matters into

93
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,260
your own hands they're actually working

94
00:03:49,260 --> 00:00:00,000
again buyer beware
