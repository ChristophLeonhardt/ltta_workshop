all right so there's this video that's been making the rounds on Facebook it's been sent to me a few times of this routine traffic stop that doesn't go wonderfully when a guy gets pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt and the officer tries to get him to sign a citation so let's see where this video goes wrong hi let's do this here's a citation okay it's gonna be for what we discussed all right so they discussed it obviously this cop is coming back from his car they've already talked about whatever the fine is went back to his car to run a few things and came back so this video is starting much later in the altercation so why this guy you know started filming is anyone's guess maybe because he's trying to get a rise of the cop and get it on film who knows or maybe he's actually trying to judging this cops being super calm it's probably not because he's afraid but you know we'll see yeah yeah perfect what I've done is I've assigned you a coordinated 20 August at two o'clock in the morning you choose to appear in court yes if not you have to learn clear obviously doesn't care does not showing any remorse whatsoever he's not concerned about the ticket or you know hoping that he's or being you know I'm not gonna do this again officer and getting off in the warning whatever this guy's clearly shown his cards here hey nah man have mercy battle so what are you refusing sign do I have to sign it Oh I'm giving giving you the options under you or do I have to sign if I don't sign it while I go to jail are you refusing to sign it if I don't sign it will I go to jail no are you sure what did I just say so if I don't sign it you will not pull me out this car and take me to jail that is correct you will not issue a warrant out later too so they can you take me to jail later if you do not comply with this citation or appear in court well your breath stank yes ma'am I mama it sounds like a great idea yeah it sounds like your mother would be long person I could put up with this kind of self-entitled mentality of no consequences for your actions and being disrespectful to everybody that was probably good move on your part Oh side note - I guess it's it's not illegal by the way - cuts out a police officer it just probably ill-advised if you ever want to get off with a warning you know or get a lesser fine this is a good way to ensure that you get the maximum penalty you will have a warrant I'm gonna sign it you dumbass duh what you thought I thought if I say give me I'm a sign it well then sign it sir give me the pen man I want to reach in your hand you pat me no you MA okay just like accusing the cop of potentially gonna shoot him or something this dude is absolutely unbearable like ridiculously this is an officer in uniform this was a regular person so we would slap him across the face clearly this dude has a few issues in his linnaeus car show for sure of how he feels for authority or the police in general yes court good man bet it guys go home squab Betty mama I'm sure your mom's definitely the only person I can put up or maybe she's the one that just lets you get away with everything your entire life and said there was no consequences for your actions that everything that happens to you is because of some some you know invisible force against you some patriarchal or systemic oppression or whatever maybe it's just you being an absolute jerk to people and showing no remorse for your actions and no respect for authority maybe that has something to do with it I don't know I'm just spitballing here appreciate you oh this guy actually posted this himself that he felt so confident he's in the right that he's willing to post publicly him saying a homophobic slur to a police officer like hold please like what like that would ruin anyone's career the you know their life their their job their like their the their friends family like this would potentially cause riots in the street and he's posting that publicly to a police officer yelling out a Rach are as a homophobic slur to him that is unbelievable the confidence this guy has oh come on man Oh knows how his demeanor oh oh no oh oh oh this oh so sad like his demeanor just completely changed like oh my goodness I didn't get what I've always wanted and something didn't go my way there's actual consequences for my action Oh apparently now the ticket matters doesn't it oh we can only hope that this guy doesn't show up for his court date and then he would depend on the state get you know points or a double fines or your license suspended or yes even being your warrant out for your arrest and being taken to jail we'll see see what happens All Right see ya in awesome news like super awesome news you can now download the rebel media app and take me with you and have access to the entire rebel lineup you
