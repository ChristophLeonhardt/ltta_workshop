EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH RUDY

GIULIANI FROM OUR OWN ALL-STAR

EARL, BRET BAIER IN NEW YORK

TONIGHT.

THE SOVIET EMPIRE.

14
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:37,703
AND FORMER WHITEWATER COUNSEL,

15
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:37,970
SAL.

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,039
SAL WHAT DID YOU TAKE AWAY FROM

17
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,240
THAT INTERVIEW WITH RUDY?

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,442
>> WELL, I LOOK AT EVERYTHING

19
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:46,245
LIKE THIS AS AN INTERVIEW AS THE

20
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:47,546
PERFORMANCE LEVEL AND THE

21
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:48,314
SUBSTANTIVE LEVEL.

22
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,449
AT THE PERFORMANCE LEVEL, HE DID

23
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:51,617
A VERY GOOD JOB.

24
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:53,119
THIS IS WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE

25
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,821
FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN HE WAS

26
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:56,789
ON SEAN'S SHOW.

27
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,924
HE WAS MORE POLISHED.

28
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:00,059
HE KNEW MUCH MORE.

29
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,227
THAT WAS VERY GOOD.

30
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,263
MANY OF HIS STATEMENTS WERE

31
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:04,629
INCORRECT.

32
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,899
SOME OF THEM WERE PREPOSTEROUS

33
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:08,601
AND SOME WERE JUST ARGUMENTS AND

34
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:08,968
OPINIONS.

35
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,170
THERE IS NO WAY THAT THE PERSON

36
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,338
UNDER INVESTIGATION OR HIS

37
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:15,007
ATTORNEY GETS TO SAY IT'S BEEN A

38
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:15,908
YEAR, THAT'S TOO MUCH.

39
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:17,309
IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE, I

40
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:19,478
THOUGHT HE DID PRETTY WELL.

41
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:22,114
>> Laura: LET'S PLAY THE FIRST

42
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:24,116
SOUND BITE FROM THIS INTERVIEW,

43
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,718
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE

44
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,353
PRESIDENT HIMSELF CAN BE

45
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:27,720
INDICTED.

46
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,154
LET'S WATCH.

47
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,655
>> THE SAME REASON THEY CAN'T

48
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:31,490
INDICT HIM, THEY CAN'T ISSUE A

49
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,224
SUBPOENA TO HIM.

50
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:35,628
REMEMBER CLINTON OPPOSED A

51
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,163
SUSPECT AND THEN HE COMPLIED.

52
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:40,099
HE DID NOT GIVE UP HIS

53
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,834
PRESIDENTIAL PERROGATIVE.

54
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:45,204
HIS ADMINISTRATION WROTE A MEMO

55
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:47,973
SAYING HE COULD COULD NOT DO

56
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:48,708
THAT.

57
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:53,212
BRET, I WANT TO GO TO YOU.

58
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:55,114
A JUDGE SAID WHEN MUELLER'S TEAM

59
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:57,883
WE WON'T INDICT THE PRESIDENT

60
00:01:57,883 --> 00:02:01,020
BECAUSE WE WILL STANDBY THIS

61
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,821
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ADVISORY

62
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:05,224
OPINION THAT YOU CAN'T INDICT A

63
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:06,659
SITTING PRESIDENT.

64
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,495
NAPOLITANO SAID THIS WAS A 1999

65
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:09,829
OPINION.

66
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:10,596
IT WAS NOT BINDING.

67
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:12,064
IF MUELLER WANTED TO CHANGE HIS

68
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:16,202
APPROACH ON THAT, HE COULD.

69
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,937
WHICH I FOUND INTERESTING.

70
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,905
>> THAT WAS A FASCINATING PART

71
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:21,574
OF THE INTERVIEW.

72
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,209
RUDY IS HANGING ON TO THAT, THAT

73
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,811
THE TEAM TOLD HIM ABOUT THAT THE

74
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,980
INDICTMENT AND STAYING TO THE

75
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,582
GUIDELINES FROM BACK IN THE

76
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,950
CLINTON YEARS.

77
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,218
HIS ANSWER SUGGESTED THEY ARE

78
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:35,254
GETTING READY FOR A FIGHT.

79
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:38,224
WHETHER IT'S LEGITIMATE AND HOW

80
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,525
THEY COULD FIGHT IT IF THEY

81
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,293
DON'T WANT THE PRESIDENT TO SIT

82
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,628
DOWN WITH THE GUIDELINES THEY

83
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:42,962
SET UP.

84
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:46,465
>> Laura: SAL, YOU HEARD HIM AT

85
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:47,166
THE END.

86
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,336
LET THEM PUT ON THE TABLE WHAT

87
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,637
THEY HAVE.

88
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:54,573
WE DON'T THINK THE GROUND ARE

89
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,308
LEGITIMATE AND WE WILL TAKE THEM

90
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:59,145
TO COURT ON THESE ISSUES.

91
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,347
HE SAID WE WILL RIP IT APART AND

92
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,450
RIP THEM APART.

93
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,620
ONE UP'SMANSHIP ON THE THREAT.

94
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,922
WHAT ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE

95
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:10,890
POINT ON THE SUBPOENA?

96
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,460
>> OH, HE IS COMPLETELY WRONG.

97
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,762
THE FIRST SUBPOENA ISSUED AND

98
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:20,132
SERVED ON A PRESIDENT WAS BY

99
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,567
JOHN MARSHAL ON THOMAS JEFFERSON

100
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,102
IN 1807.

101
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,104
A SUBPOENA WAS SERVED ON MADISON

102
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,240
AND WE KNOW ABOUT THE SUBPOENA

103
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,312
SERVED ON PRESIDENT NIXON AND

104
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:35,247
THE SUPREME COURT RULED THE

105
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:38,017
PRESIDENT HAD TO OBEY IT.

106
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,385
HE IS WRONG.

107
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,386
THE OPINION ONLY TALKS ABOUT

108
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,254
WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN INDICT A

109
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:43,055
PRESIDENT.

110
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:45,057
PRESIDENT CLINTON DID NOT FIGHT

111
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,492
THE SUBPOENA FROM JUDGE STARR.

112
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,928
HE ASKED US TO WITHDRAW IT AND

113
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,730
SAID HE WOULD COME IF WE DID.

114
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,832
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

115
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,867
WE DON'T KNOW IF HE WOULD HAVE

116
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,268
FOUGHT IT.

117
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:57,203
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE

118
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,471
FOUGHT IT.

119
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:03,142
IF HE IS SUBPOENAED AND INVOKES

120
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,310
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, PRESIDENT

121
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,945
TRUMP AND THE COURT RULES

122
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,247
AGAINST HIM, HE CAN SAY LIKE

123
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,382
ANDREW JACKSON SAID, YOU MADE

124
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:12,751
YOUR LAW, NOW SEE IF YOU CAN

125
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:15,087
ENFORCE IT.

126
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:20,926
THE SUPREME COURT SAID TWICE

127
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:24,129
THESE ORDER VISIT TO BE OBEYED.

128
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,065
HE COULD SAY I AM THE PRESIDENT

129
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,700
AND I WON'T DO IT.

130
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,768
THEN WE WOULD HAVE A

131
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:32,304
CONSITUTIONAL CRISIS ON OUR

132
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:32,605
HANDS.

133
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,873
>> Laura: BRET, I BROUGHT UP THE

134
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,208
ISSUES OF STAFFERS.

135
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,843
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL BROUGHT IN A

136
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:40,913
NUMBER OF THE FORMER STAFF OF

137
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,782
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

138
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:44,717
STATES.

139
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,017
WATCH.

140
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:47,887
>> ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT ANY

141
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:52,024
OF THE FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE

142
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:52,391
STAFFERS?

143
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,059
HOPE HICKS' NAME WAS THROWN

144
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:55,761
AROUND WORKING WITH DON JR. ON

145
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:57,062
THE STATEMENT ABOUT THE TRUMP

146
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:58,297
POWER MEETING.

147
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:00,366
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HER

148
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,133
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPECIAL

149
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:01,467
COUNSEL?

150
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,236
>> GOD THAT WOULD BE REALLY

151
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:04,536
CHEAP.

152
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:07,106
IF THEY DID THAT TO HER, A

153
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:07,940
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE TO

154
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,075
STEP IN AND ACT.

155
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:13,212
IT WOULD BE TOTAL INJUSTICE.

156
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,013
>> Laura: BRET?

157
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,681
>> BUT LISTEN, YOU HAVE JIM

158
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,249
COMEY WHO TOLD ME HE DID NOT

159
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:21,754
KNOW WHAT THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT

160
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,456
MICHAEL FLYNN WAS.

161
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:27,326
LAWMAKERS SAYING HE TOLD THEM

162
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,361
THAT THE FBI AGENTS DIDN'T

163
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:32,097
BELIEVE THAT FLYNN WAS LYING BUT

164
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:35,567
THE SCREWS WERE PUT ON FLYNN AND

165
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:36,669
HE PLED GUILTY.

166
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,237
HE MOVED FORWARD.

167
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,539
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SCREWS BEING

168
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,374
PUT TO A LOT OF OTHER STAFFERS

169
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:43,509
WHO HAVE DONE INTERVIEWS.

170
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,644
I THINK THE POLITICS OF THIS IS

171
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:46,378
INTERESTING.

172
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:49,148
I CAN SEE THE COMFORT THAT

173
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:49,848
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS IN RUDY

174
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:52,384
GIULIANI BEING A FIGHTER FOR

175
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:52,885
HIM.

176
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,187
THEY MAY HAVE MORE AMMO SOON AS

177
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:58,324
THIS IG-REPORT IS EXPECTED TO

178
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,726
COME OUT SOON.

179
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:03,162
MICHAEL HOROWITZ MAY HAVE

180
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,931
DETAILS WE HAVE YET TO REVEAL.

181
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:10,502
>> Laura: BRET, ON A DIFFERENT

182
00:06:10,502 --> 00:06:11,103
TOPIC.

183
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:13,372
PRESIDENT REAGAN FOR WHOM I

184
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:13,706
WORKED.

185
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,075
GOES OVER TO MOSCOW IN 1988 AND

186
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,378
GAVE A SPEECH AT MOSCOW STATE

187
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:19,778
UNIVERSITY.

188
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,714
THIS THING ABOUT KOREA AND

189
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,983
WHETHER THE SUMMIT WILL HAPPEN.

190
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,118
I WONDER IF THERE WILL BE A DAY

191
