1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,500
THE GOP IS ROLLED OUT THEIR
BLUEPRINT FOR THE TAX PLAN, AND

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,089
SEVERAL MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS
INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

3
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:10,660
AND NEW YORK TIMES HAVE GOTTEN
THEIR HANDS ON IT.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,660
BEFORE WE GET

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,870
INTO THE DETAILS WE DO KNOW, LET
ME BE CLEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,169
THERE ARE MANY DETAILS WE DON'T
KNOW.

7
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:18,470
FOR INSTANCE, WITH THESE

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,930
MASSIVE TAX CUTS HOW DOES THE
GOP INTEND TO MAKE UP FOR THAT

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,360
LOST REVENUE?

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,700
ESSENTIALLY WHO
ENDS UP PAYING, THAT IS UNCLEAR,

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,090
AND ESSENTIALLY THEY ARE SAYING
WELL, WE ARE JUST GOING TO LET

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,530
THE TAX PEOPLE FIGURE THIS OUT.
AND IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY.

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,530
BUT

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,120
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA, THOSE
WHO EARN THE LEAST, WHO PAY

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,930
ABOUT 10% IN FEDERAL TAXES,
WOULD END UP PAYING 12% UNDER

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:47,930
THIS PLAN.

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,960
SO TAXES ACTUALLY DO
INCREASE FOR THE LOWEST EARNERS.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:03,200
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME MORE
DETAILS --

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,110
SO AGAIN, THOSE IN THE LOWER
END OF THESE TAX BRACKETS, THOSE

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,690
WHO PAY 10% IN FEDERAL TAXES,
WOULD END UP PAYING 12%.

21
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,690
BUT THE

22
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,750
GOP IS SAYING WE ARE GOING TO
INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT PEOPLE

23
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:26,770
CAN DEDUCT SO THAT WILL MAKE UP
FOR IT --

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:48,200
SO PEOPLE 

25
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,600
WHO AREN'T THEIR
CHILDREN, FOR INSTANCE.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,810
THERE'S MORE, THERE'S A LOT
MORE, BUT WHAT IS YOUR TAKE

27
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,430
ON THIS, GUYS?

28
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,439
FIRST OF ALL SIMPLIFYING THE
TAX CODE, HAVING SEVEN BRACKETS

29
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:09,149
AND DROPPING IT DOWN TO THREE,
THAT'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT -- THAT

30
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,180
DOESN'T MAKE IT SIMPLER.

31
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,269
IT JUST
MAKES -- IT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT

32
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,719
TO CUT MORE TAXES FOR MORE
PEOPLE, THAT'S ALL.

33
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,719
IT DOESN'T

34
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,540
MATTER WHAT THE OTHER BRACKETS
ARE, YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT ONE YOU

35
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,150
ARE IN, THERE COULD BE 38, JUST
FIND THE ONE YOU'RE IN AND

36
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,230
THAT'S THAT.

37
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,999
SO THEY ARE
PRETENDING, AND THEY WILL DRIVE

38
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:31,290
HOME THE SIMPLICITY OF IT, BUT
THE FACT IS THE TAX CODE WON'T

39
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,859
GET SIMPLER, THE RICHEST PEOPLE
WILL STILL END UP PAYING FAR

40
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:39,709
LESS, AND I SUSPECT ON THE
DEDUCTIONS THEY ARE PROBABLY

41
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:43,739
RIGHT, THAT RAISING IT FROM 10
TO 12 FOR THOSE AT THE VERY

42
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,739
BOTTOM WON'T DO ANYTHING,
BECAUSE THEY WILL ZERO OUT

43
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,180
ANYWAY AND THEY ARE CLAIMING
THAT MORE PEOPLE WILL BE IN THE

44
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,629
0% TAX BRACKET.

45
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,669
I'M DUBIOUS OF
ANYTHING THEY CLAIM BUT RAISING

46
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:57,780
THE STANDARD DEDUCTION IS
SIGNIFICANT.

47
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,780
BUT MERELY

48
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,439
PRESENTING A TAX PLAN WHERE YOU
RAISE THE LOWEST RATE AND LOWER

49
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:07,329
THE TOP RATE IN THE COUNTRY WITH
SCANDALOUS INCOME INEQUALITY

50
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:12,059
JUST SEEMS LIKE AS PUZZLING A
DECISION AS A MAJOR POLITICAL

51
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:15,609
PARTY COULD MAKE, BUT OF COURSE
IT'S THE DECISION WE KNEW THEY

52
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:16,609
WOULD MAKE.

53
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:20,150
AND ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT
WHENEVER THERE IS A DEMOCRAT IN

54
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,309
OFFICE, FOR INSTANCE WHEN OBAMA
WAS IN OFFICE, THERE WAS A LOT

55
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:26,629
OF EMPHASIS ON THE DEBT.

56
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:29,590
WHAT
ARE WE DOING ABOUT THE DEBT AND

57
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,980
THE DEFICIT?

58
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,469
AND THEY CLAIM THEY
ARE FISCAL CONSERVATIVES, BUT IN

59
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:38,279
REALITY YOU HAVE TOM PRICE USING
PRIVATE JETS FOR TRAVEL TO

60
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:43,489
PLACES WHERE HE HAS PRIVATE
PROPERTY, AND NO PROBLEM WASTING

61
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,269
TAXPAYER MONEY ON STUFF LIKE
THAT, AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME

62
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:49,599
THEY ARE PUSHING FOR A HUGE LOSS
IN REVENUE.

63
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,599
NOW THIS STORY JUST

64
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,510
BROKE SO ANALYSIS HASN'T BEEN
DONE YET THE KIND OF FIGURE OUT

65
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,129
EXACTLY HOW MUCH THE U.S.

66
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:59,379
WOULD LOSE IN REVENUE, BUT I'M
SURE IT'S GOING TO BE

67
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,860
SIGNIFICANT, ESPECIALLY
CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT

68
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,799
THEY ALSO WANT TO DO AWAY WITH
THE ESTATE TAX.

69
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,900
THEY ARE SO NONSPECIFIC ABOUT
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO TO COVER

70
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,900
THOSE LOSSES.

71
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,329
THEY WON'T BE
TAKING INASMUCH MONEY SO HOW ARE

72
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:13,450
THEY GOING TO PAY FOR THINGS
LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY?

73
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,490
I HAVE NO

74
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,519
IDEA.

75
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,060
SO IMMEDIATELY I THINK,
DON, I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.

76
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,790
THE ESTATE TAX AND THE
ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM WOULD BE

77
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,410
REPEALED, THEY WANT TO DO AWAY
WITH THE ESTATE TAX, THAT OF

78
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,770
COURSE WOULD LEAD TO A LOSS OF
REVENUE FOR THE GOVERNMENT, AND

79
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:38,020
THEY WANT TO LOWER THE CORPORATE
TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 20%.

80
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,020
I

81
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,710
WOULD ACTUALLY BE MAYBE OKAY
WITH THAT, OR AT LEAST A LITTLE

82
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,180
MORE RECEPTIVE TO THAT, IF THEY
ACTUALLY DO AWAY WITH THE

83
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,960
LOOPHOLES THAT THESE
CORPORATIONS HAVE BEEN USING.

84
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
SO

85
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,480
IN SOME CASES SOME OF THE
LARGEST, MOST PROFITABLE

86
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,100
CORPORATIONS DON'T PAY ANYTHING
IN FEDERAL TAXES.

87
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,100
IN FACT IN

88
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,430
SOME CASES THEY ACTUALLY GET TAX
REBATES.

89
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,430
BUT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK

90
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,840
AT ON AVERAGE THE TAX RATE, THE
EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, FOR THESE

91
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,750
CORPORATIONS, IT'S ABOUT 18.7%
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THESE

92
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,630
LOOPHOLES AND DEDUCTIONS THEY
CAN USE.

93
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,630
SO IF YOU DO AWAY WITH

94
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,200
THE DEDUCTIONS AND MAKE THESE
CORPORATIONS PAY 20%

95
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,840
THEN WE ARE HAVING A
CONVERSATION.

96
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,860
AND THEY ARE JUST GOING TO
KEEP LYING, AND THAT'S THE KEY.

97
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,610
THERE ARE NO DETAILS HERE,
THERE'S NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO

98
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,110
RUN BECAUSE THEY KEEP SAYING WE
ARE GOING TO ELIMINATE MANY OF

99
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,140
THE PERSONAL DEDUCTIONS THAT
AFFLUENT FAMILIES USE -- WHICH

100
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,960
ONES?

101
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,680
SO WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT
WILL SCORE, BUT WE KNOW THEY

102
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,450
WILL LIE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND
OBFUSCATE THE TRUTH.

103
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,050
TABLE KEEP

104
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,670
SAYING AMERICAN CORPORATIONS
CAN'T COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL

105
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,970
MARKETPLACE, BUT OUR ECONOMY AT
LEAST ON THE CORPORATE LEVEL IS

106
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,580
THRIVING.

107
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,920
THE DECEIT AND THAT IS
EVIDENT IN WHAT WE SEE EVERY DAY

108
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,620
IN THE STOCK MARKET, IT COULDN'T
BE DOING BETTER.

109
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,620
SO THEY CAN

110
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,680
OBVIOUSLY STAND TO PAY MORE OF
THEIR FAIR SHARE.

111
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
BUT I AGREE,

112
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,620
IF THIS PREVENTS COMPANIES FROM
PAYING ZERO -- BUT OF COURSE IT

113
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,620
WON'T.

114
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,520
IT'S RIDICULOUS FOR US TO
SUPPOSE IT MIGHT, THERE IS

115
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,950
ZERO CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING.

116
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,750
AND TO BE CLEAR ABOUT ONE
OTHER COMPONENT WE ARE TALKING

117
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,230
ABOUT, THE ARGUMENT IS THAT IF
WE JUST LOWER THE CORPORATE TAX

118
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,450
RATE THEN THESE CORPORATIONS
WILL DEVELOP NEW JOBS AND THAT

119
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,600
WILL HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS.

120
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,570
IT'S
PART OF THIS WHOLE NOTION OF

121
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,570
TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS.

122
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,870
IT NEVER WORKS.

123
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,790
IT DOES NOT WORK, WE HAVE SO
MANY CASE STUDIES TO PROVE THAT.

124
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,880
IN JANUARY TO INTERCEPT IT A
GREAT JOB PROFILING SEVERAL BIG

125
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,720
CORPORATIONS -- CISCO, G.E.

126
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,340
--
WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THE TAX

127
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,430
BREAKS, WITH THAT EXTRA MONEY?

128
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,760
AND IN CALLS WITH THEIR

129
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,190
INVESTORS, IN LEGAL FILINGS, IT
SHOWS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT

130
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,420
ALL THEY DO IS USE THAT MONEY TO
CONSOLIDATE, ACQUISITIONS, AND

131
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,020
THEN WHAT HAPPENS AFTER
ACQUISITIONS?

132
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,020
THEY LAY A BUNCH

133
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,491
OF PEOPLE OFF, SO PEOPLE
ACTUALLY LOSE THEIR JOBS AS A

134
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:10,630
RESULT OF THESE TAX CUTS.

135
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,700
SO
IT'S JUST ABSURD.

136
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,530
THE BEST CASE STUDY FOR IT IS
THE 80S, THAT'S THE CASE STUDY

137
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,080
TO CITE, WHICH IS THAT THEY DID
ENACT THESE SORTS OF THINGS, IT

138
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,490
DIDN'T WORK, AND WE WERE PAYING
FOR IT WELL INTO THE 90S. AND

139
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,930
PROBABLY STILL TODAY, I'M NOT AN
ECONOMIST OBVIOUSLY -- BUT FOR

140
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:36,830
THEM TO GO BACK TO THIS, I KNOW
TRUMP HAS AN APPEAL TO PEOPLE

141
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,020
WHO LIKE THINGS SIMPLIFIED AND
THAT WAS KIND OF THE WAY HE RAN

142
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,700
AND THAT'S ABOUT AS NICE A WAY
AS I CAN SAY THAT, THIS WILL

143
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,130
LOOK SIMILAR TO PEOPLE.

144
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,200
SOMEBODY
CAN SAY I WAS PAYING X PERCENT

145
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,010
WHEN I WAS PAYING X PERCENT
BEFORE, BUT LIKE SO MUCH ELSE

146
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,380
THAT HAS COME SO FAR FROM THIS
ADMINISTRATION, MOSTLY DUE TO

147
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,370
EXECUTIVE ORDERS BECAUSE HE
CAN'T GET A DAMN THING PASSED,

148
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,840
IF IT LOOKS GOOD ON PAPER THERE
IS SOMETHING HIDING BEHIND IT.

149
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,600
HERE IS THE DEAL, YOUR TAXES
ARE COMPLICATED.

150
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,920
THEY ARE

151
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,730
COMPLICATED BECAUSE WE RUN THE
COUNTRY WITH THE MONEY YOU PAY.

152
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,980
AND EVEN IF YOUR TAX RATE IS
25%, IT WILL BE 12% FOR SOME OF

153
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,600
THE MONEY YOU MADE IN 25% WHEN
YOU REACH A CERTAIN LEVEL

154
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,050
BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS HOW IT IS,
IT'S COMPLICATED.

155
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,050
YOU MIGHT HAVE

156
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,990
SOME MONEY INVESTED, IF YOU
DON'T HAVE MONEY INVESTED AND

157
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,889
JUST MAKE A SALARY YOUR TAXES
ARE ALREADY MORE SIMPLE, YOU

158
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:36,139
FILL OUT A 1040 EZ, THE WORD EZ
IS RIGHT IN THERE.

159
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,139
YOUR TAXES

160
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:42,909
ARE COMPLICATED BECAUSE RUNNING
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS

161
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,540
HARD, WE NEED TO RAISE BILLIONS
TO MAKE THE COUNTRY GO.

162
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,540
YOU

163
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,749
DON'T HAVE TO DO IT, YOUR
ACCOUNTANT DOESN'T, OR YOU FILL

164
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:52,279
OUT THAT SIMPLE FORM.

165
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,110
YOUR LIFE
WON'T BE MADE BETTER BECAUSE

166
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,500
INSTEAD OF SEVEN TAX BRACKETS
AND A BUNCH OF OTHER NUMBERS,

167
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:04,899
THERE ARE NOW THREE.

168
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:08,160
IT MAKES NO
DIFFERENCE, ONE NUMBER WILL ONLY

169
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,930
APPLY TO YOU.

170
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,499
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO
YOU, BUT IT'S NOT IN THE

171
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:16,300
COMPLICATION OR SIMPLICITY OF
YOUR TAXES.

172
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,300
IT MAKES A

173
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,189
DIFFERENCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE
TUITION YOUR KIDS PAY FOR

174
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:23,940
COLLEGE, BECAUSE PUBLICLY FUNDED
COLLEGES RECEIVE THEIR MONEY

175
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,470
FROM THE MOST PART FROM THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, IT HAS AN

176
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,649
IMPACT ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN
YOUR STATE, THE FEDERAL

177
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:34,740
GOVERNMENT FUNDS PARTIALLY
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.

178
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,740
ALL

179
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:42,610
THESE THINGS PEOPLE ENJOY WILL
BE SACRIFICED IN ORDER TO GET

180
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,689
THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS A HUGE
TAX CUT, IN ORDER TO GIVE

181
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:49,680
CORPORATIONS A HUGE TAX CUT, AND
IT'S ALL BEING DONE WITH THIS

182
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,209
RIDICULOUS IDEA THAT THESE
CORPORATIONS ARE GOING TO MAYBE

183
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,839
TRICKLE-DOWN SOME OF THAT WELL
FOR YOU, MAYBE CREATE SOME JOBS.

184
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,410
BUT AGAIN, CASE STUDY AFTER CASE
STUDY PROVES THAT ISN'T THE

185
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,410
CASE.

186
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,950
CAN I READ A QUOTE THAT GOT
ME?

187
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,399
THIS IS FROM TALKING POINTS

188
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,360
MEMO -- CORPORATIONS SEE THEIR
TOP TAX RATE CUT FOR A PERIOD OF

189
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,689
FIVE YEARS COMPANIES CAN
REDUCE HOW MUCH THEY PAY BY

190
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:15,420
IMMEDIATELY EXPENSING THEIR
INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL GOODS.

191
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,420
THE

192
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,600
, NEW BENEFITS WILL BE GIVEN TO
FIRMS IN WHICH THE PROPHETS

193
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,320
DOUBLE AS THE OWNERS PERSONAL
INCOME.

194
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,699
THEY WOULD PAY AT A 25%

195
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:24,910
RATE DOWN FROM 39.6.

196
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,820
THIS
CREATES A POSSIBLE LOOPHOLE FOR

197
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,990
RICH INVESTORS, LAWYERS,
DOCTORS, AND OTHERS, BUT

198
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,420
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY
THEY WILL DESIGN MEASURES

199
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,089
TO PREVENT ANY ABUSES.

200
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:36,619
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT
THOSE MEASURES MIGHT BE.

201
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:41,209
AND ALSO, I'M TELLING YOU,
THEY WON'T. PAUL RYAN WON'T,

202
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:44,350
THEY WON'T. THEY AREN'T
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

203
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,350
AND THE

204
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,320
NOTION THAT THOSE SENTENCES
STILL EXIST -- THE

205
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,810
ADMINISTRATION SAYS THE TAX PLAN
IS FOCUSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS

206
00:10:50,810 --> 00:11:00,339
FAMILIES, MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES
WILL FARE POORLY BECAUSE THEY

207
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:02,529
DON'T CARE.

208
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,689
DOES ANYONE THINK
THE KOCH BROTHERS ARE SAYING

209
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:08,440
WE'VE GOT TO GET MIDDLE CLASS
FAMILIES -- DAVID?

210
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,110
ONE OF THEM

211
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,779
IS NAMED DAVID?

212
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:14,779
DAVID SAYS TO
MYRON --

213
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,369
CHARLES.

214
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:21,360
WHERE IS MYRON?

215
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,189
THAT
CONVERSATION ISN'T HAPPENING

216
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:27,749
WITH MYRON OR CHARLES OR DAVID
KOCH.

217
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:30,000
THAT'S RIGHT.

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,689
BY THE WAY,
REALLY QUICK WHEN IT COMES TO

219
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,610
DEDUCTIONS, THEY AREN'T CLEAR
ABOUT WHICH DEDUCTIONS OR

220
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,360
LOOPHOLES THEY WILL DO AWAY WITH
IN ORDER TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS

221
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,670
OF REVENUE BECAUSE THEY DON'T
PLAN ON DOING AWAY WITH

222
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,670
DEDUCTIONS.

223
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,740
BUT THERE WAS ONE
DEDUCTION I WAS REALLY CONCERNED

224
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,160
ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY
DEDUCTION THAT REALLY DOES HELP

225
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,509
MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES, AND
THAT'S THE MORTGAGE INTEREST

226
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:53,189
RATE DEDUCTION, RIGHT?

227
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:55,220
AND
LIKELY BASED ON THIS BLUEPRINT

228
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,139
THEY WON'T TOUCH THAT.

229
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:00,110
EVERY
TIME THIS TAX DEBATE COMES UP

230
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,379
AND REPUBLICANS SAY WE WANT TO
DO AWAY WITH SOME OF THESE

231
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:06,759
DEDUCTIONS, THE FIRST DEDUCTION
THEY TALK ABOUT IS THE MORTGAGE

232
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,029
INTEREST RATE DEDUCTION, BUT
THEY SAY THEY WON'T TOUCH THAT.

233
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,949
THAT IS HELPFUL TO PEOPLE BUT
THAT'S SOMETHING WE DECIDED ON

234
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:12,949
YEARS AGO.

235
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:16,329
IF WE WERE GOING TO
OVERHAUL OUR TAX PLAN, OUR TAX

236
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:19,819
CODE, WE COULD DO IT BUT I GOT
NEWS FOR YOU, IF LOGICAL PEOPLE

237
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:22,790
DECIDE IT THAN THE RICH ARE
GOING TO PAY MORE THAN WE MIGHT

238
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,179
DO AWAY WITH THE MORTGAGE
DEDUCTION AS PART OF A MASSIVE

239
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:28,790
OVERHAUL THAT ACTUALLY HELP THE
MIDDLE CLASS, BUT WE'VE HAD

240
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,459
GENERATION AFTER GENERATION GET
USED TO THAT MORTGAGE DEDUCTION

241
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,440
AND COUNT ON IT SO NOW IT SEEMS
LIKE IT'S SOMETHING VITAL WE

242
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,759
WOULD BE TAKING AWAY SO IT'S
PROBABLY HERE TO SAY.

243
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,999
IT'S AN INCENTIVE FOR
HOMEBUYING AND ALSO FOR PEOPLE

244
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:43,540
WHO ARE IN THE BUSINESSES THAT
THEY ARE TRYING TO PROTECT AS

245
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,110
WELL, THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING.

246
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,129
A COUPLE POLITICAL THINGS TO

247
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:50,319
REMEMBER, NONE OF THIS CAN
HAPPEN UNTIL THERE IS A BUDGET

248
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:55,089
PASSED AND UNTIL SOME OF THE
MOST EXTREME RIGHT-WING

249
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:58,459
CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF THE
HOUSE HERE WHAT IS IN THIS THEY

250
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:00,529
ARE GOING TO VOTE ON IT, AND
THEY WON'T APPROVE A BUDGET

251
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,759
UNTIL THEY KNOW WHAT IS IN THIS
BECAUSE THEY WANT THIS TO BE

252
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,860
EVEN MORE HARSH THAN IT IS ON
PAPER NOW.

253
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,320
THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO
RUN OUT OF MONEY, THEY WANT US

254
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,610
TO NOT HAVE A BUDGET, THAT'S
THEIR DESIRE, IS TO HAVE THE

255
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,089
GOVERNMENT BE SO SHORT OF CASH
THAT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT -- THAT

256
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:19,429
EVENTUALLY THEY HAVE TO
PRIVATIZE ALL THE SERVICES THE

257
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:22,310
GOVERNMENT PROVIDES, BECAUSE
THAT IS THE COUNTRY THEY WANT TO

258
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,310
LIVE IN.

259
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,579
TO SOME EXTENT I ADMIRE
THE FEW WHO ARE HONEST ABOUT

260
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,470
THAT.

261
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,870
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THEM
WHO ARE THAT FRANK ABOUT IT.

262
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,870
I

263
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,709
TOTALLY DISAGREE, I THINK IT'S
HEARTLESS AND FOOLISH AND

264
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,769
UN-AMERICAN, AND CERTAINLY NOT
CHRISTIAN, WHICH I AM NOT BUT

265
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:42,869
THEY CLAIM TO BE --

266
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:44,709
AND WOULDN'T WORK.

267
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,730
THAT THE OTHER PART, IT
WOULDN'T WORK.

268
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,509
AND THE OTHER

269
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:53,639
POLITICAL STORY IS THAT THE
PERSON WHO IS HAPPIEST ABOUT

270
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,470
THIS IS MITCH MCCONNELL BECAUSE
IT'S NOW OVER IN THE HOUSE AND

271
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,989
HE CAN STEP AWAY FROM WHAT HAS
BEEN A HORRIBLE RUN FOR HIM, AND

272
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:03,459
NO BEGINS WHAT I IMAGINE WILL BE
A BAD RUN FOR PAUL RYAN.

273
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:07,569
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
PHOTOS OF A HAPPY, JOYFUL MITCH

274
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:08,569
MCCONNELL FINALLY.

275
00:14:08,569 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU WILL LOOK
LIKE THIS, AS OPPOSED TO THIS.
