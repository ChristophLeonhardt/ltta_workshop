revenues now in Turkey says it's high time the u.s. stopped arming Kurdish forces in Syria the group considered to be terrace by Ankara has been fighting Islamic state in the region but with ISIL all but defeated there the presence of the US and Turkey seemingly agreed on Friday to end support for the Kurds our friend and Ally told us every time that it was not an option but an obligation since ISIL has now been eliminated this obligation has disappeared well if Washington finally does cut its military supplies going to the Kurds it will go some way to easing the current tension between Turkey and the US that issue has been a long-term stumbling block in relations between the two NATO Giants with Ankara claiming the u.s. is arming one terror group to fight another however America seems to have its own definitions to describe the various Kurdish groups in the region as Samira Khan now explains hurts the largest stateless minority in the world the Kurdish population is in Turkey Iraq and Syria and it seems for the u.s. it's more about where they are rather than who they are let's start with Turkey on one side Ankara Washington's regional and NATO ally on the other Ankara sworn enemy the rebellious Kurdistan Workers Party fight against the - terrorist organization should not be let with another terror organization we want to believe that our allies would choose to stand beside us and not on the side of terrorist organizations well the choice is obvious and the u.s. lists the PKK as a terrorist group we support turkey in the first fight against terror and terror groups like Isis and the PKK over in Iraq the Kurdish pesh MERGA were crucial in the u.s. fight against the Islamic state Washington put up money and provided all the weapons they needed but with most of the fighting over so is America's benevolence the Iraqi Kurds are losing the oil wells they fought out of terrorist control the reserves are now going back under government control the u.s. obediently Baghdad the Kurdish push for independence has also received the cold shoulder with secretary Tillerson stating that the referendum and its results lack legitimacy and the u.s. supports the united Iraq the disappointment is very great although we have a long negative experience with the American the wrong size they sent to Abadi through their strong position against the referendum encouraged Abadi and the Iraqi government to come so strongly and be in a position that they think they can even cancel or eliminate status of federalism and call dastan often neighboring Syria where the Kurdish YPG also got everything they needed from the US and their fight against ISIL money weapons training the Kurdish they proven to be the best fighters they really proven to be the most loyal to us and we should be working with him much more so that we're working but they managed to hang on to the oil fields that they liberated with no questions from their American pals Washington claims that it seeks a unified and sovereign Syria but it also wants a Syria without Assad I think that the United States will continue to support the Kurds we heard general mattis and the Secretary of Defense say only a few days ago that the United States would remain in the northern Syria in order to give traction to the Geneva process and that means that the United States wants leverage they want leverage against Assad against Russia and it gets to Iran and of course the Kurdish troops that the United States has been arming now own about 25 percent of Syria's territory in the north and somewhere around 50 percent of all the oil and gas in Syria so this gives the Kurds quite a bit of well that's unless turkey gets its way we're saying something mr. Trump clearly stated that he had given clear instructions not to provide the YPG with arms and that this nonsense should have ended long ago
