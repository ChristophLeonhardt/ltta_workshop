00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
in a remote corner of the Democratic
Republic of Congo armed militias of

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,719
burning villages scores of people have
been killed and over 100,000 have been

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,759
displaced it's often hard to tell what's
going on in distant parts of the world

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,960
but by using satellite data we can
monitor this conflict in almost

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,019
real-time and detect flare-ups that may
indicate violence is starting to spread

6
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:30,599
what we're seeing doesn't look good this
was the scene in western Uganda in

7
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,270
February waves of refugees fleeing
violence in the DRC and crossing Lake

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,059
Albert at the height between five and a
half and six thousand people coming

9
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:48,780
across today Andrew Harper was on the
shore they grabbed everything that they

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,610
owned which is basically nothing and
they brought it with them on the boat

11
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:59,010
all these very clear signs were
indicative that whole areas had been

12
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:11,970
basically cleanse the refugees said that
armed men had burned houses forcing

13
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,150
entire villages to flee across the lake
most to the town of Cebu Goro many came

14
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,729
from here in a Cheree province but the
scale of the violence was unclear so we

15
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,380
analysed aerial data NASA satellites
captured the locations of active fires

16
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,500
every day and many were burning on the
days that people fled now most were

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,329
probably forest fires not acts of
violence so we used OpenStreetMap data

18
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,329
to pinpoint populated areas and obtained
new high-resolution satellite pictures

19
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,360
of those villages they tell a clear
story here's one village photographed

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,689
before the violence began and the same
village on February 17th

21
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:03,420
nearly every structure is burned this
pattern emerged in village after village

22
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,419
all along the lakeshore humanitarian
groups estimate that more than 2,000

23
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,840
homes have been destroyed
now while satellite data

24
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,250
gives us a clearer picture of the unrest
it Charice history helps us understand

25
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:25,269
why the violence has suddenly erupted at
this time in the early 2000s two

26
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:31,330
communities the hammer and the land uu
were involved in a bloody conflict more

27
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,830
than fifty thousand people were killed
before peace was restored why this

28
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,390
currently is happening now is fairly
suspicious these communities were

29
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:46,150
reconciling relationships had improved
Stern says that this time it's not

30
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,530
ethnic tensions but political
motivations that are most likely driving

31
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,110
the conflict the country has been in a
period of political turmoil as President

32
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,890
Joseph Kabila fights for his political
survival it is one of unfortunately many

33
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:10,540
many different often interlocking
conflicts more recently the violence and

34
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,870
ature II has spread inland the situation
has escalated with the figures of

35
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,299
displacement basically doubling in the
week our reporting suggests that after

36
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:26,200
the lakeshore villagers fled the
violence built over this mountain ridge

37
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:34,239
driving people westward many toward the
town of Banja up to 100,000 people are

38
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,959
displaced in the e2v province it's
probably not a very good standard so

39
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,819
while it's unclear what stoking this
violence it's troubling how suddenly it

40
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:52,540
flared and for the many displaced who
knows when or even if they'll be able to

41
00:03:52,540 --> 00:00:00,000
return home
