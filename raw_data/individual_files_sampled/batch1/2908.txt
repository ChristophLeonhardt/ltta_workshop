my prediction is that Amazon will acquire an organization like a Whole Foods or Wegmans as they have not figured out grocery so grocery is probably the most ripe consumer sector to be disrupted in all of the consumer world the largest consumer sector in the world about a 750 billion dollar market just in the US but if you go into the middle of a supermarket and you spin yourself around and you opened your eyes it would take you a while to figure out you're not a 1985 same bad lighting same bad brands and often times the same depressed clerk checking you out Whole Foods came in and offered something differentiated better unfortunately it was just too damn expensive and there's some there's some people doing a great job there's Wegmans there's Trader Joe's when you look at the size of the market there's still huge opportunity my prediction is that Amazon will acquire an organization like a Whole Foods or Wegmans if they have not figured out grocery they need distribution and these companies have beaten up some of the minutes being up so badly that they might be worth the acquisition price just for the the distribution they could close close the stores down and just use them as warehouses
