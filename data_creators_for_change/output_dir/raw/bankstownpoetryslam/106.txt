hunter of my artistic plunder follow my

airless just like my mother's long is

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,219
that night the police didn't come and I

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,570
was left defenseless corrosive kieres

00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,989
the streak marks across my bare chest

faded although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've left I still wear</font>

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,810
the emotional stress of scars concealed

firma my head wheezes reverberations

21
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,110
seepage of my unchecked ruminations

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,320
occupying the atmosphere<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believed them</font>

back until I a little boy<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

34
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,930
extenuating my arms to be like Superman

35
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,290
not knowing that the real Superman was

36
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,180
not a suited man like a suited men that

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,340
note to my father's door that night I

38
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,520
was visiting him I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it odd that</font>

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,280
he left me alone again as if he were

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,739
expecting them but they they were not

41
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,600
expecting me badge<font color="#E5E5E5"> waved discreetly feet</font>

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,140
shuffle suspiciously where is he I don't

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,170
know I answered honestly after they left

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,780
I left always wondered if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were put</font>

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,390
understand the foul odor of his resorts

47
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,820
what was my father's profession I guess

48
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,220
you can say it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chemist of sorts</font>

49

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,200
my mind and forcing it out is full point

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,269
trying to uncover the point of my

54
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,470
seemingly measly existence to you all

55
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,739
another poet to my parents and

56
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,000
ungrateful child through this system

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,670
another brick in the wall and of my

00:03:18,670 --> 00:00:00,000
strength I now stand invincible
