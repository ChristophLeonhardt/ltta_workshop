welcome back everyone joining us now from Washington with a look at access and national political reporter for Axios Jonathan Swan Jonathan good to have you with with us this morning so what's the access is one big thing heading into this morning well don't trump's expected announcement today of as much as 50 billion dollars a year worth of tariffs on hundreds of chinese products this is a big deal on its face economically but analysts fear could lead to a trade war china's already threatening to retaliate against farm states in which Trump did very well electorally now a little bit of inside dope on this which we reported last week in an oval office meeting on Thursday Trump's team brought him about thirty billion dollars worth of tariffs and Trump turned to his economic adviser Kevin Hassett and said quite a quote Kevin you've got to make the number bigger so it's gonna be bigger than thirty billion and I'm told it could be in the fifty billion dollar ballpark so let me ask you really quickly what has actually us learned regarding the most recent leak of our Trump's unhappiness with the spending bill well this was one of the remarkable we you see this so often the tension between the Trump administration and Capitol Hill but this played out in real time yesterday I was getting calls from senior Republicans both in the House and Senate who were perplexed that they were finding out through the press in real time about Trump's and happiness with aspects of the spending bill he was unhappy that it didn't have enough money for border war funding and again just very angry phone calls from the hill saying what who leaks this and why do they feel that this is helpful to leak this when we're on the precipice of doing this deal and obviously we've had to swallow a lot of stuff we don't like in the end Paul Ryan went to the White House Trump agreed to it you know peace peace at last but it was a very fraught process yeah and it seems that the word leaks is now back in the headlines given some of the recent news that has been made about leaks coming out of the White House including that report about the president not supposed to congratulate president Trump he did that and that obviously upset a lot of people but how are these leaks being perceived on Capitol that one in the one that you were just talking about in the way that Capitol Hill views this Trump administration is just with befuddle Minh they still after more than a year do not understand this administration they don't understand the motivation for the leaks one one aide senior aide called me yesterday from the hill from the Senate and said to me why do we have this tick-tock moment-by-moment account of his every mood and emotion why why do they like no it was like a plea for help to understand why it happens there really there really is a lack of understanding of how this White House works and how he as an individual works and one of the reasons it's such a leaky place is he doesn't really care he's very free and open in the way he talks he talks to a lot of people and and the staff don't feel particularly loyal to him yeah it was also a point that Marco Rubio brought up Senator Marco Rubio saying he doesn't understand why somebody who is privy to that kind of sensitive information working for the president would then turn around and leak information that could potentially be harmful to the president why work for a guy that you're trying to undermine let me ask you really quickly Jonathan could Trump's lack of trust damaged his relationship with lawmakers on the hill well he has a very fraught relationship with lawmakers on the hill and part of the reason is because he is his base instinct is to be suspicious of their motives and that that instinct is reinforced in his conversations with certain people outside the White House when he talks to somebody like Lou Dobbs the Fox News host who Trump Fox Business host who Trump listens to attentively Lou Dobbs will tell him that Republican leadership is not to be trusted that they're trying to play you and one of trumps greatest fears is his fear of being played for a sucker so when he hears from people outside the White House including his son Don jr. that they're all trying to play him and pull the wool over his eyes this reinforces his instincts and you get little moments like we had yesterday so let me ask you really quickly about these leaks are they taking their toll on the White House from what you're hearing from your sources obviously we heard the chief of staff John Kelly he was extremely frustrated but are they going after trying to find out who may have been responsible for some of these leaks well the the Russia to distinguish between them the spending bill leak that we talked about just then it's not a huge deal but the the do not congratulate the leak that one of his nation's national security advisers gave him these briefing notes that is being taken very seriously inside the White House they are doing a process to try and find out who leaked it people are suspicious I've spoken to a senior officials who are suspicious of certain people on the National Security Council and in one of his done is inflamed when it's already a climate of mistrust and mutual suspicion inside the West Wing yeah you can imagine what that atmosphere must be like given the fact that these leaks continue to happen Jonathan Swan live for us in Washington DC thank you we're gonna be reading axiom in just a little bit and viewers can sign up for it at Axios calm
