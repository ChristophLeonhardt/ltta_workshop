00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,120
My name is  Jonathan Weiss, I am the founder and CEO of

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,680
Oswalds Mill Audio

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,060
As known as OMA

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,600
and we're in our Dumbo, Brooklyn showroom

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,320
surrounded by all of our products

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,880
We're really an outlier in the high end audio world

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,500
we make everything from the signal source

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,760
in terms of analog, that's record players

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,540
which we make out of solid slate

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,880
We make our own line of tube amplifiers

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,180
and we're the only company in the world that makes conical horn loaded loud speakers

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,020
for high end home use

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,360
We make everything so that we have total control over the sound

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,380
One of the first phases to our products is

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,080
quarrying the slate

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,980
and this is very special slate

17
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,740
because it's actually very soft

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,720
which from an acoustic standpoint is really desirable

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,660
it dissipates vibrations and resonances extremely well

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,700
much better than harder slate

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,140
so when they are quarrying the slate

22
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,500
then they'll literally use hand tools to cleave off sheets

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,660
which break off

24
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,140
and then are placed on a truck of taken with a gondola

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,060
into the main fabrication part of the quarry

26
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:55,340
where a huge diamond saw with water is used to cut these cleaved off irregular pieces of slate

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,660
the last stage is honing and putting a very fine edge

28
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,100
Bevel

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,280
so that it doesn't chip

30
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,380
we use cast metal in a lot of different products

31
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,220
All foundries, they have a furnace.

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,780
The metal is put in solid form into this vat and it becomes molten

33
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,760
like just out of the movie terminator

34
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,740
then it's poured into this sand mold

35
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,080
It goes in, hardens, the sand is busted away and you have a rough casting

36
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,120
which then goes to the various finishing processes

37
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,100
The it has to be welded

38
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,140
edge treatment

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,600
after that, thats acomplished

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,880
then it goes to be powder coated

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:58,000
where it literally is baked and cured like into this super hard durable finish

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,740
much better than paint

43
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,820
All of our loud speakers have steel stands or infrastructure

44
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,100
and all of those elements are powder coated

45
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,220
Yeah the mill is essentially our laboratory

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,240
it's our reference listening space

47
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,040
it's where we can put elements, new and old, together

48
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,660
listen to them, evaluate them

49
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,540
and decide what direction we want to take

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,600
with new products and new technologies

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,440
There are things that were never surpassed in terms of sound quality

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,540
the industry has moved in ways that are not about the ultimate sound quality

53
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,540
but about size, convenience, and cost

54
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,940
and none of this stuff is convenient, small, or cheap

55
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,640
but it does represent the best sound that's really ever been made

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,000
All of our loud speakers are made out of Pennsylvania hard woods

57
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,800
and these are all woods which, Martin guitar, which is the world's best acoustic guitar company,

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,420
they're right across the valley, they use the same woods that we do

59
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,660
so I know that they're tonally great woods

60
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,680
at that point it comes into our wood working shop

61
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,800
where it's cut down further into boards of varying thickness and width

62
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,480
which will be joined together

63
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,460
to create loud speaker enclosures

64
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,960
amplifier enclosures, horns, all using meticulous hand done joinery

65
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,940
that allows the wood to expand and contract in your home

66
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,420
It's like a living thing

67
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,420
this is a very difficult, time consuming, expensive process

68
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,580
we're the only company in the world that does this

69
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,660
nobody else makes loud speakers using solid wood joinery construction

70
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,980
not today.... not that I know ever

71
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:05,600
At a certain point the parts come from the wood shop, metal working shop, powder coat

72
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,300
they come to our central facility, where we do the final assembly

73
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,580
most of our equipment is very big, and it's very big because  it has to be

74
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,280
sound waves can't be miniaturized

75
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,740
it's physics

76
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,420
It's very old school, it's not mass production

77
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,920
and the components that we use, are simply the highest grade possible

78
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,280
aerospace level stuff

79
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,060
The last phase is really

80
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,760
our installation of the equipment

81
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,440
in our client's homes of wherever they are going

82
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,180
if you have an amazing system, and you put Elvis on, it's frightening

83
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,820
It's like, he's right there

84
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,120
what the system is doing is, it's taking the energy that came out of elvis

85
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,280
Literally

86
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,760
sound waves are energy

87
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,860
so it's taking that energy

88
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,640
and it's reproducing it so perfectly

89
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:17,500
that you have this uncanny feeling that somebody's there that's been dead a long time

90
00:06:17,980 --> 00:00:00,000
that's what amazing sound quality is
