1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,070
- Ultra-endurance sports didn't
just change me physically,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,310
they actually gave me a brand new life.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,540
Throughout my 30s, I was
climbing the corporate ladder,

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,840
very intent on achieving

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,600
the traditional idea
of the American dream.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,180
But deep down inside,
I started to question

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,530
this path that I was on.

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,130
For well over a decade,

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,240
I really hadn't been
taking care of myself.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,200
I had become a junk food addict,

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,300
I was 50 pounds overweight,
kind of semi-depressed,

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,370
and shortly before I turned 40,

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,630
I was climbing up a
simple flight of stairs

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,470
to go to bed one evening,
and I had to pause halfway.

15
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,060
I was winded, I was out of breath,

16
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,530
I had tightness in my chest,

17
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,890
and it was a very specific moment in time

18
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,530
in which I realized that not only that

19
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,530
I needed to change my lifestyle habits

20
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,110
but that I had the willingness
that I truly wanted to.

21
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,070
I realized that vague
ideas of eating better

22
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,530
or working out a little
bit or going to the gym

23
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,820
weren't really going to work for me.

24
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,670
I needed something specific,
something definitive.

25
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,610
I'd played around with a
bunch of different diets,

26
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,060
to no avail,

27
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,060
and I sort of attempted this

28
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,610
experiment in plant-based
eating as kind of the last

29
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,030
thing that I hadn't explored.

30
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,830
And I didn't have a big expectation

31
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,260
that it would make a big difference,

32
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,340
but within about seven to 10 days

33
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,650
of eating nothing but plants,

34
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,880
nothing with a mother,
nothing with a face,

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,740
I experienced this extraordinary thing,

36
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,350
like I had this resurgence in vitality,

37
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,460
my mental acuity improved,
my sleep improved,

38
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,280
I had this sense of well-being and energy

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,510
that I hadn't really felt
since I was a teenager.

40
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,470
And I didn't really know what I was doing,

41
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,840
but I knew in that moment
that I was onto something.

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,690
And it started getting me thinking

43
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,170
about human potential
and my own potential,

44
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,750
because if I could make
such a simple, basic shift

45
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,930
and experience such a dramatic result,

46
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,760
where were there other untapped reservoirs

47
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,990
of potential that I could explore?

48
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,720
And that's what got me
interested, ultimately,

49
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,100
in the world of ultra-endurance sports.

50
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,700
At the peak of training, I would say

51
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,460
I was training about 25 hours a week,

52
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,420
so it was really almost a second job,

53
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,580
and at the time, I was
still a practicing attorney,

54
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,860
I have four kids, I'm busy
doing a lot of things,

55
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,610
and in order to make the
time that was required

56
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,590
to appropriately prepare for this race,

57
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,900
I had to make some significant cuts

58
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,930
and really look hard and fast

59
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,340
at how I was spending my
time on a day-to-day basis.

60
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,310
I had to get rid of late-night television

61
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,850
and sort of business
meetings that could be

62
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,170
pushed to a conference
call or an email chain

63
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,380
to free up the time that was required

64
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,710
so I could show up at the
starting line and know

65
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,480
in my heart of hearts that
I could complete this race.

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,630
I started training,
which really connected me

67
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,480
with myself in a very profound way,

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,460
and to the surprise of
myself and many other people,

69
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,930
I ended up showing some
prowess in this field

70
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,830
and ended up competing
at a very high level,

71
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,590
specifically a race called Ultraman,

72
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,160
which is a double Ironman
distance triathlon.

73
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,710
Over the course of three days,

74
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,490
it completely circumnavigates

75
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,429
the entire big island of Hawaii.

76
00:03:04,429 --> 00:00:00,000
(playful orchestral music)
