00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
hi friends so when I was old enough to

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,140
ride a bike competently but not yet old

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,420
enough to write it by myself my dad and

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">my brother and I would helm it up and</font>

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,260
ride down the hill and<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the train</font>

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,910
tracks and behind the neighborhood pool

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,969
to what was my very first book store it

8
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,160
was a borders may it rest in peace but

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,900
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> small and comfortable and</font>

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,730
whenever we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went there my dad would let</font>

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,400
me pick out whichever book I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font>

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,099
whichever one even<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time that it was</font>

13
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,050
the unauthorized biography<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brittany</font>

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,150
spews but then I got a little older and

15
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,279
a little bigger and so did my<font color="#E5E5E5"> book store</font>

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,100
our cozy quiet location shut down and

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,230
then became a shoe store<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then open</font>

18
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,870
area and then a giant trying to books

19
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,290
but mostly DVDs and CDs remember those

20
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,690
opened up down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> street by then I was</font>

21
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,489
in it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the free book not so much the</font>

22
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,200
family bonding<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was no coincidence</font>

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,390
that I'd go in pockets line with that

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">bed bath and beyond tall holding money</font>

25
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,879
and leave with some solid mid-2000s emo

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,890
albums about leaving this town and never
