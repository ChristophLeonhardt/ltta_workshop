so if you're in the restaurant and there's something that you don't like you have to let us know because that's the only way that we could turn that around and make you happy it's very hard to do that if you leave the restaurant what really bothers me as an owner is if someone is having a bad time somehow it's like they get a dish they don't like it it happens okay don't go home and go on Twitter and start complaining because there's nothing I could do at that point find a manager call them over and say I'm gonna join us if you're in my restaurant someone's gonna say order something else we'll be happy to cook something else for you we're not gonna charge for that dish but don't sit there and feel moving mad and then go home and lash out on social media because I can't help you at that point I had people in the restaurant use social media say I'm at you know craft and you know my entree is taking them you know 30 minutes to come out and I've seen this online if they tag me I'll see it call my manager and go get to that table make sure everything's ok tell them I saw them you know post this online and I feel like oh my god that's great service so if you're in the restaurant and there's something that you don't like you have to let us know because that's the only way that we could turn around and make you happy it's very hard to do that if you leave the restaurant it's nonsense where I'm afraid if I send something back they're gonna spit in my food like that's just crazy it's not gonna happen that's also I think the mark of a good restaurant is how they actually take care of problems if there's no problem no drama and restaurants great but how does a restaurant take care of a problem how do they can they turn it around can they make you feel that that you're on their side because now their problem is not your problem you're gonna fix it
