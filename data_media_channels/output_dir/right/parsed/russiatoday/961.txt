before the talks had even started Putin
and Trump have already shaken hands
twice the first came when they met in
Helsinki and the second one happened in
front of the media before the start of
the talks and it's an issue that's
raised eyebrows before
appears unlikely that the president will
confront Putin is going to convey to
Putin that he's weak
from what is now our American
perspective how does he earned a
face-to-face full-scale bilateral
meeting with the US president
the president's trip abroad will also
include a meeting with Russian President
Vladimir Putin for the leaders of these
two countries to me I'd like to hear
someone say that's when he goes this
NATO conference who will he represent
will he represent the United States
fully represent Moscow the former KGB
colonel in the Kremlin could be doing
some important intelligence gathering on
his American counterpart he wore our
terrified the best-case scenario is a
scenario where basically nothing
terrible happens
