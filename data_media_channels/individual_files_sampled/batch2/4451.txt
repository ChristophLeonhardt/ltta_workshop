amid speculation about whether dr. Christine Blasi Ford will attend Monday's Senate G issued committee hearing an endless discussion of the political tactics at play it's important remember the human being at the center of it all a woman who tried desperately from what we can tell to avoid the exact situation she now finds herself in a woman who now finds herself subjected to intense national scrutiny intimidation and as she put it annihilation all because she says she was sexually assaulted and a letter Senator Chuck Grassley her lawyer wrote quote she has been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats as a result of these kinds of threats her family was forced to relocate out of her home her email has been hacked and she has been impersonated online but her attorneys letter also mentioned that dr. Blasi Ford has received messages of support one such message an open letter from the 1984 alumni of Holton Arms Blasi Ford's alma mater on behalf of their friend and classmate those women wrote quote we stand with our friend dr. Christine Blasi Ford and admire her honesty and resolve on behalf of our nation here with me now one of the alumni who signed that letter Samantha Gary McGarry describe your relationship to dr. bazi for Christy and I met in seventh grade if we've known each other for 40 years we were friends and you know for the six years we were at Holton arms and we've stayed in touch Loosli since then our class is pretty tight class and we've stayed in communication for what is it 35 years now it strikes me that it's a pretty tight-knit school it's a small school and and and people are pretty connected is that a fair characterization salutely absolutely and I think you can see that in the response that the school has had on a number of levels in the last few days what was your reaction when she came forward this weekend and put her name to this accusation that it's been floating out there anonymously well I'm not sure she did put her name to it I think that it got leaked and then she had to respond in order for it not to kind of completely spin out of her hands she didn't ask to be in the situation she's in now she asked for confidence we were all obviously shocked that it was somebody that we know and respect reading the account that she provided both in the letter and in the interview she conducted with the Washington Post as someone who moved in the social circles that she did who was friends with her in high school how did it strike you struck me is true it struck me as someone who had to make a really painful decision to essentially at this point forfeit her privacy and have to relive a traumatic event in a very public and traumatic away did you know either Brett Kavanaugh or Mark judge when you were in high school at Halton Arps they were acquaintances of mine they were good friends of good friends of mine so you know how those circles kind of go out but I don't have any specific recall of either of them and I'm not able to comment on their and them specifically from from that time but in terms of the social networks you were embedded in they were around at the periphery this is not a it's not implausible that they would be at a party together or something like that oh no they were definitely at parties together I think that and I say that because in talking with a lot of about my classmates you know our sense is that between the summers that they were involved in a variety of different country club activities and sports and just the general Venn diagram overlap of our schools and our dances and events and festivals and things there's just quite a bit of overlap and then people have to remember that these are classes of just like 65 people we're not talking about thousands of people so you really knew each other you really did get to know each other have you spoken to your classmate Christine recently I've not spoken to her directly she has been communicating with with me and several other people through one of her best friends his good friend of ours do you have a sense of how she's doing she's a strong woman and she has a strong foundation with her family and her friends and she's tremendously grateful for the support that she's gotten from from everyone and I think that's important to her so that she doesn't feel that she's just hanging out to dry here by herself I guess is someone that there's known her for as long as you have there are people out there who think that she is either making this up she's other fabricating it or she is miss remembering what happened both of those things have been said by folks and I would like you to say what would you like to say to those people well I think they should be ashamed of themselves to suggest that someone who's been sexually assaulted isn't remembering this correctly is just makes it just makes my head explode I think it makes a lot of women feel that way sexual traumas is real and deep and lifelong it's something that Chris Chrissy has spent her life trying to forget this isn't a mistake of identity or experience and we need to stop suggesting that women who come forward with these experiences and tell their truth are somehow mistaken as someone who went to school with her and thinking about children there there are folks in that school right now and many of the alumni who were not from that year have signed a letter of support as well what kind of message do you think it sends what do you think the folks that are moving in the social circles you did as a teenager at Georgetown Prep and Holton arms are gonna learn about how they should conduct themselves based on what the Congress does well it's an interesting question really I think that to the extent that we still look to our public leaders for any kind of guidance what Congress does now is going to register in the debate about how these things are handled in our country how women coming forward with these types of experiences are treated and whether they can be dismissed out of hand or whether they are going to be taken seriously and I think I stand with my classmates and my schoolmates and say we expect to be taken seriously we have to be taken seriously and we will find a way to be taken seriously Samantha Gary thank you very very much for making the time this evening thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up
