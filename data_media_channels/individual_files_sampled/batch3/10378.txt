hello and welcome to worlds apart just as the war in Syria started to show some promise of abating the violence in Yemen has intensified to the degree that may once again put the Middle East on the brink of a major confrontation that's the idea of forging some kind of regional understanding amount to anything more than a doomed Sisyphean task well to discuss that I'm now joined by iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif Minister it's great to see you in Moscow welcome good to be here and good to be with you Minister you've been in this city since Monday and I assumed the topic of Syrian reconciliation always feature high on your agenda but I wonder if the fast-moving events in Yemen with the now confirmed killing of the former president Saleh have forced you to shift your focus how vulnerable is the Syrian peace process to outside events well I'm very happy to be in Russia and we worked very closely with Russia and other regional countries in order to help bring about an end to Syria I'm here at this time for Caspian which is an important issue for Iran Russia and the three other countries neighboring in Caspian we have made important progress in Syria with Russia and Turkey both through our Stano process as well as through Sochi and we had hoped from the very beginning that a political solution could be found for Yemen as we continue to hope that a political solution could be found for Syria a few days after the breakup of the now 30 month-old hostilities in Yemen the mobile plant of Yemeni civilians we proposed a four-point plan for Yemen immediate ceasefire urgent humanitarian assistance interim any dialogue and the formation of an inclusive broad-based government that remains I believe the only solution to Yemen the minister I'm sure you will agree with me that that plan is now perhaps even less realizable after the such a high-profile killing do you think that complicates the international effort both in Yemen and in Syria unfortunately the events of the past few days have not helped this process and we hope that with these unfortunate developments over the past four or five days and with the unfortunate developments of the past 30 months and beyond everybody in Yemen and all the neighboring countries would come to the realization that we have to put this nightmare to an end and we need to get together and put a plan to end the conflict in Yemen now if I may share a personal impression with you because the video of the president's body wrapped in a blanket being mounted onto a pickup truck there's some very grim resemblance to the killing of Muammar Gaddafi's six years ago and I was kind of surprised that mr. Sabich was a controversial figure for sure but I was very surprised by the lack of sympathy in the Arab or more broadly regional media when it comes to his faith is that faith is that the new political norm in the Middle East I certainly hope that the leadership in the area would move in the direction of responding to the needs and requirements of the population so that they do not face this grim fate at the end of their life the killing of Soloff came shortly after he pulled out of his tactical alliance with the hoodies and signaled their willingness to negotiate with the saudi-led coalition shifting his alliance once again as he did many times throughout his very long rule I think what I'm hearing from you is the regret about his faith but what did you think about his change of political allegiance well unfortunately Saudi Arabia and the coalition that it has built has been basically destroying Yemen killing Yemeni civilians now it's a a common international fact that Saudis have not refrained from even killing babies and elderly in their indiscriminate bombardment of civilian areas in Yemen for the past 30 month and it's been a basically an endless campaign without any success and without any achievement other than huge number of human lives that has been lost or named so trying to forget this very grim reality very catastrophic reality and not respond to the will of the Yemeni people is certainly not something that should be welcomed well nobody is trying to forget about this grim reality but in his final days a former president Saleh did try to call for reconciliation he called for you know the increased humanitarian access he talked for a dialogue did you invest any trust in the in those cold we certainly want those hopes to be realized we certainly want to see an end to the conflict in Yemen but that and that would require some sort of dialogue and some sort of a political settlement but it requires at the same time that all sides be ready for that I believe what has prevented an end to the conflict in Yemen has been the reluctance of Saudi Arabia to engage in anything other than a military campaign I believe once they are ready and once everybody else is ready to engage in in an attempt to facilitate an intra Yemeni dialogue because we cannot from the outside impose a solution on the Yemeni people we should only facilitate a solution by their many people and Iran for its part is prepared to do whatever it can to facilitate such a political salute to end this nightmare Minister you're leading me perfectly to my next question because any power with leverage in the Middle East and North Africa uses proxy politics and I hope you would agree that neither Iran nor Russia for that matter are exceptions it is widely believed that Tehran has certain degree of influence on the hoodie rebels do you think that influence whatever it may be compels your country to exerting some sort of restraining effect on the rebels I think everybody should use whatever influence that they have in whatever place in in Yemen in Bahrain in Syria in order to end violence and bring about a political solution at the same time nobody from outside could impose a political solution what we need to do is to act in a concerted way all of us that are I mean Iran is not engaged in bombing Yemen there are countries whose Air Force are dropping bombs on on the people of Yemen on basically on a routine basis on Rama but there I can say on a daily basis but at least on a routine basis so I think they don't need influence they can simply decide to stop bombing Yemen and we would certainly use our influence to encourage a political solution as you said the Iran is not involved in bombing Yemen but I'm sure you've heard the Saudis particularly your Saudi counterpart minister jubeir accused Iran of supplying ballistic missiles to the Houthi rebels I know that Iran called those charges baseless and unfounded but you have one of the most capable intelligence services in the region do you have any idea of whether the who these claims that they have that kind of weaponry are accurate and if so who might have provided those missiles as well as the expertise to use them well what we have heard from our intelligence is that the Houthis the Yemenis is not just a booth is the Yemeni army which received a lot of weapons from many countries during the presidency of late President Ali Abdullah Saleh including from Russia have the capability to develop those to modify those to increase their accuracy or range domestically they do not need to receive them from Iran and we have made it very clear that we do not provide them with that you made suffer several references to Saudi somebody policies in the region and I hope you won't be offended when I say this but when I listen to your your Saudi colleague you often make pretty similar points you know we are the ones who are trying to make bridges they are the ones who are burning them we are open for dialogue but they're held banned on the military solution or expansion what could possibly cut through this very thick stack of almost identical mutual action we're not the ones who support the Saddam Hussein we're not the ones who support the Taliban you remember only three countries recognized Taliban Saudi Arabia was one of them we're not the ones who supported Isis or nusra you know you see that now their former allies are exposing what they did to support these terrorist extremist organizations we're not the ones who're funding extremism throughout the globe we're not the ones who are sending every of the terrorist bombers whether it's in the in Russia in the US they have somehow been affected by the ideology that they promote and financed so actions speak much louder than words we simply suggested a peace plan for Syria Saudi Arabia insisted on a military solution they said with the help of God we either remove Bashar al-assad politically or militarily we said from the very beginning that Syria does not have a military solution we said from the very beginning that Yemen requires a political settlement not a military certainly we're not bombing Yemen they are so I think actions speak much louder than the minister I'm sure you just in your professional capacity you have to listen to what your count or adversaries are saying and if we substitute let's say Yemen for Hezbollah you know they would make the same claims of supporting various militia groups and providing weapons and you know we in Russia too far away to take sides even though I'm sure Moscow appreciates you know you see Hezbollah is not bombing anybody as well as a political organization in Lebanon we are not the ones again to invite the prime minister of a country to our country and have him resign we try to use our friends our influence in the region in order to defeat extremists terror in order to work together for a political solution that's what we're doing in Syria with Russia and Turkey we were not always on the same side I mean Iran and Russia we're not always on the same side no not on the same side on a number of regional issues if I may ask you specifically about Syria because I agree with you that Saudi Arabia at least initially used to have a very recalcitrant position but most more recently I've heard Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov praise Riyadh for its efforts in bringing together the militarized Syrian opposition and sort of prodding down towards the Geneva process how do you see the Saudis changing tack at least when it comes to Syria well it is regrettable that they only decided to start the political process permanent when they defeated Wendy but when they were defeated militarily on the ground in in Syria and that has caused a huge number of lives huge number of lives have been lost we suggested this peace plan over 50 months ago as you said better late than never now let us see how much they hope they will facilitate the Sochi process as you know the leaders of Iran Russia and Turkey gathered in Sochi in order to support a political process I hope others will join now you often criticized the Saudis for wanting nothing less than a hundred percent this zero-sum attitude and let me ask you in that vein to what extent can the Saudis count on the accommodation of that interest in Syria and what do you think that interest in Syria are at the current stage I think everybody needs to define it their interest in Syria in terms of a better future for the Syrians political inclusiveness in Syria that all Syrians would participate in determining their future without foreign intervention based on every help whatever you want to call it we are supposed as I said to facilitate not to dictate I think the minute we all understand that only the will of the people can be stand the test of time then we will be moving in the right direction I believe all of us in the region have a common destiny I think Iran and Saudi Arabia both live in a very difficult neighborhood we cannot gain security at the expense of insecurity of one another Iran and Saudi Arabia will suffer from the same extremist groups we will be the targets of the same extremist groups I think the sooner our Saudi neighbors realize that the snake that they produce all the stakes that they have produced in the past 40 years be it saddam hussein be it the taliban be it isis have ended up turning against them it's now time for them to start producing flowers producing development producing prosperity rather than producing terrorist organizations and dictators minister it's a very difficult emotional question for us Russians as well because we are quite used to this fighting dynamic and selling ourselves as if we are being unfairly accused of various stuff but sometimes somebody needs to make the first step and do a little bit more than he or she is asking of the adversary is Iran ready to go a little bit further than what it wants the Saudi Arabia to do yeah we responded positively to every offer for dialogue every single offer that was made to us by anybody including by the GCC when GCC suggested at that time Qatar was the chair of the GCC suggested the dialogue between Iran and GCC we immediately responded positively when Kuwait on behalf of the GCC suggested a dialogue between Iran and the GCC our president went to Kuwait and had a direct discussion with the Emir of Kuwait and we responded positively but check who has rejected all these efforts so we have taken all these steps but as you said you take one step you expect others to take reciprocal steps and unfortunately every step that we have taken has been rebuffed instead of reciprocated by all Saudi neighbors well minister we have to take a very short break now but we will be back in just a few moments stay tuned welcome back to worlds apart with iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif Minister let me ask you about the United States because the United States is a sort of favorite adversary of both for Iran and for Russia you and foreign minister Lavrov have a very similar way of philosophizing about international affairs I think your views often overlap but there is a major difference in the way the Russian and the Iranian leadership approach both the current and the former American administration because the Iranian seem to be appreciative respectful of the Obama administration but show quite a bit of contempt for the current administration the Russians on the contrary don't hide that I dislike of the Obama team but they are very restrained when it comes to criticizing Trump even when he is obviously crude what do you make of this kid-glove true we are we are equal opportunity criticizers which we criticize the way that the Obama administration dealt with Iran as we criticized the way that the Trump administration the difference was that during the Obama administration we had the nuclear negotiations and we worked out what seems to be a historic agreement and Russia played an extremely important role in that process and we appreciate the role that Russia played we appreciate the role that Europe play but the United States also played the role which was not as positive as as that of Russia or Europe but more positive than we expected from the United States historically now the United States is resuming the animosity the hostility that they have exhibited they are returning to the old rhetoric to the old ways not that President Obama ever abandoned them unfortunately currently the current administration does not use any accepted international behavior in order to deal with Iran and and what you see from Iran is a reaction to this Minister you may the Iranian position pretty clear and I think it is not just a run that finds actions or statements of the current American president quite disagreeable but I'm particularly that's why I'm particularly interested in what you make of the Russian treatment of Donald Trump because I do think it's actually very very patient at least when you come into account how Russia usually reacts to the United States how do you read it what do you think is Moscow pursuing in this sort of kid-glove approach to Donald Trump well I believe Russia has a prudent foreign policy and it's pursuing its interests and I usually do not engage in interfering in the internal and external affairs of other cultures you will agree that the strategic considerations also impact your position because everything in the world especially in the middle is this closely interlinked do you think there is any benefit to Iran to Russia trying to play this sort of good cop with Trump I don't mean it in a way of a good call but being more positive with Trump than let's say some of the others well again we focus on our own relations with Russia our own cooperation with Russia on regional issues where in Syria for instance Iran and Russia work together and then Russia has some as they say D conflicting arrangements with the United States we respect the decisions that our Russian colleagues make in the in the in terms of their bilateral relations with the United States or in terms of D conflicting with the United States because sometimes in the field those may be necessary while I believe nobody accepts the fact that the United States continues to be in Syria in spite the will of the sovereign government of Syria and I think that view is shared by by Russia as well yes can I ask you specifically about the nuclear deal you do strongly dislike the Trump's position on the nuclear deal but I wonder if there is still enough incentive for Iran given your current rapprochement with the Europeans with the Japanese with the Koreans to hold this deal regardless of the American compliance with it because mr. Trump may or may not pull out of the deal but as I'm sure you know even the Obama administration showed that the White House has its informal ways of influencing the willingness of companies to deal with Iran is it worth for your country to stick to that deal regardless of what the Americans do well Iran has impact of health its side of the bargain we have fulfilled our promises and we have shown that we are a trustworthy international partner when we negotiate we stick to our words unfortunately as you pointed out rightly so the implementation by the United States has been lackluster in at best the attempt by certain US circles to prevent economic relations with Iran continued both during the Obama administration less publicly so and during the Trump administration it's been more public basically stated policy of a president Trump and his administration as far as Iran is concerned we assess the situation to see whether continuation of our observance of of the deed would serve our national security interests and when it comes when it comes to the point that the benefits of continuing the deal would no longer exist when it comes to the point that Iran is not receiving the debt dividends that were promised in the deal then we will decide accordingly now I think it's now clear that the American regional allies intent on either renegotiating or at least reinterpreting the deal I'm talking about Israel and Saudi Arabia and I wonder what do you think is the best diplomatic tactic in terms of safeguarding the deal because you have the Europe the Russians the Chinese on your side what do you think is the best approach try to appeal to Trump directly or try to work through Saudi Arabia and Israel who also have that interest outside the United States in Europe and Russia and they always tried to prevent ID you remember the statements that were made the lobbying effort that was done the pressures that were exerted in the course of the negotiation of the deal then they played they attempted to prevent the deal from passing in in the legislature in the in the US Saudi Arabia unfortunately and Israel because of its nature seek conflict and hostility and crisis as a means of survival do you understand your correctly that you believe that it is easier to actually persuade Trump to stick with the deal rather than trying to persuade Israel and Saudi Arabia that the deal must be upheld this is an international agreement if they decide to live by their international commitment it is in their own interest if they decide to violate an international agreement first of all they will show to the world that they're not reliable that nobody can deal or negotiate on breach or reach an agreement with any US president because the next president may come and basically violate that deed that is not a good signal that they would be sending to the international community but if they decide to send that signal then Iran has its options and options are not limited and I don't think those options will be very pleasant for the United and if I may ask you one last question Israel and Saudi Arabia do not have formal diplomatic relations but precisely because of the Palestinian issue but it's clear that the diplomatic contacts let me put it that way have intensified significantly just in his latest address Benjamin Netanyahu quoted the Saudi crown prince's belligerent statement on Iran as you would quote your close ally so I think that's a very telling sign how much time do you give them before I'm sort of coming out and into the open a bit with that close relationship and do you think that relationship is still being held back by the lack of the resolution to the Palestinian question well I do not believe that's new that has been going on for a long time it's now a bit more public but the Arab Street has seen so much suffering of the Palestinian people the fact that Palestine the rights of the Palestinians are trampled upon on on a routine basis the fact that every neighbor has been invaded aggressed upon by Israel basically with impunity over the past seventy years these are all facts that make it very difficult for Saudi Arabia to openly disclose its secret relations with Israel that has existed for a very very you just said that it's become something that you would expect that the rights of the Palestinians are being trampled upon for decades doesn't that mean that the Arab Street no longer cares about it no the Arab Street does care and that is why instead of addressing the root causes that are leading to the type of extremism that we see in the Arab world Saudi Arabia and its friends are trying to divert attention but diverting attention will not reduce the cause will not address the cause I think the sooner our Saudi neighbors realize what the threat is and address that threat instead of trying to divert the attention from the threat at the sooner we will move in the right direction in our region well minister this is all we have time for I really appreciate your being with us and tell viewers please share your comments on our Twitter Facebook and YouTube pages and I hope to see you again same place same time here on worlds apart you
