Blake Farenthold was a congressman from Texas he was Republican and he had to settle a sexual harassment case because of how he had harassed women in his congressional office let me show a picture of Blake Farenthold and then tell you what he did to warrant those sexual harassment charges and why he had to pay out he would tell his co-workers about how his wife wouldn't sleep with him now if I'm his wife I don't blame him I don't blame her but but not the kind of thing you should be sharing at the office and then he asked a woman that works under him to show her nipples to him and then he can said that about a woman that he had had a wet dream about her that is totally an utterly gross ridiculous and for a boss in an any office to say that it is preposterous so of course Farenthold has spent eighty four thousand dollars not in his own money but in taxpayer funds to quietly settle that lawsuit when the news broke this past December he vowed to quickly pay the money back but you're gonna be shocked to find out never did interesting so by April the White House Ethics Committee I'm sorry not the way that's the House Ethics Committee close to wrapping up a probe into more office misconduct he quit Congress so because why he had said well look man if the House Ethics Committee finds that I did do this sexual harassment then I won't let the tax payers fail I'll pay the eighty four thousand dollars well good news for the taxpayers and for Farenthold he got a new job you I hope you're sitting down you're gonna because you're gonna be shocked at what the job is he's a lobbyist say it with me of course that's the revolving door so he does scummy things well both in the sexual world unfortunately and sexual harassment etc but also in run-of-the-mill corruption in Congress hey lobbyist give me money I'll do whatever you ask me new donors give me money I'll do whatever you ask me to do now that he's left Congress his shame no problem the Calhoun Port Authority in Port Lavaca Texas says that's our guy why why do they hire ms lobbyist to increase the port's visibility well okay for the first time we are seeing and hearing about that port and that is a port I have want no part of okay so he is lobbyist and why is that good news for the taxpayers because now he has plenty of money to pay them back look he was already a millionaire but as a lobbyist he'll be getting paid a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year well plenty of money to pay back that eighty four thousand dollars so that news broke today so did this news in a statement to ABC News the Texas Republicans said that his legal counsel has told him not to repay the eighty four thousand dollar settlement so nope not gonna pay it but wait a minute I thought you said that if it was shown and then you left and then you were gonna pay it's like yeah that's what I said because I'm a professional liar I just got hired as a lobbyist so kind of case closed these are the people who are our so-called representatives now luckily Farenthold is not anymore but particularly vile guy now doing a particularly vile job two easy ways for Young Turks one is hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you are notified of our videos
