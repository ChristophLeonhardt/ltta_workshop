I am not going anywhere I'm not gonna be bullied I'm not intimidated and I'm gonna go toe-to-toe with him everything he throws at me believe me my tips are much better than theirs they're going to release more tapes if I need to I'll do what I have to do to protect myself how are you going to determine whether you need to we'll see he's threatening to get me arrested he's trying to intimidate my publisher trying to intimidate me Donald Trump has met his match Amoroso may have as many as 200 secret recordings according to the New York Times she released the latest tape to MSNBC this week it's a conversation between Omarosa and Laura Trump Donald Trump's daughter-in-law and a senior adviser to his reelection campaign that says that row Omarosa says happened three days after she was fired from the White House these are excerpts of a longer conversation between the two NBC has listened to the tape in full and the clips are in the proper context joining me now the winner of season 4 of The Apprentice Randall Pinkett and back with me Zerlina Maxwell Randall you won season 4 you obviously know Donald Trump as I do this seems to me to be the talking about Omarosa now having all these tapes this seems to me to be a real case of someone saying I better protect myself because I don't know when and how this will end but when it does I want to be able to protect myself because before we get down to whether or not she has a smoking gun for Muller or any of that you have to deal with why would somebody be doing all of this right on and the only logical reason is I know the folks that I'm hanging with I better protect myself yeah so I worked for the Trump Organization for a year and the culture that I saw on the Trump Organization is reflective of the culture we see coming out of the White House a culture where lies were acceptable a culture where you had this is in his private but in his private business lives were except lives were acceptable coming from Donald lies were acceptable where people would stab you in the back and where you had to constant look out for yourself and we think about not just Omarosa behavior think about the fact that FBI director Comey took copious notes right why did he do that he was worried that Donald might live flin no no cohen michael cohen audio taped the conversation his own lawyer his own lawyer audiotape comedy everybody around you take your notes and tape and taping and so I might have a carrot you might have a character problem palmarosa is simply the next in line and there's got to be others besides her who knowing the culture of the white house know that the way to protect themselves is to get evidence to protect yourself Serleena you've said and I've seen you say this on other shows that let's not forget that I'm a row so whatever our pinions are did work in the White House under Bill Clinton and came with more experience than some of the people that he made senior staff look I think there's this misconception that she had no business being in the White House but she worked in the Clinton White House when Bill Clinton was the president and so the idea that she's completely unqualified you know in terms of her you know her actual work qualifications that's sort of a red herring now character-wise does she belong in the White House that's I think a credible conversation in terms of her background but I would also say this every single she knew that she was working with people who tell lies and so in order to protect yourself from Liars you document everything that's happening knowing that they are going to lie about it in the future and so that's what's happening she she's making claims they're calling her a liar and every single time they do it she puts out a tape as receipts to say nope you're the liar and I think she's playing a much longer game they're essentially stuck in this position almost ironically like the Clinton campaign was that I worked on at the end of the election cycle the last thirty days there were two thousand Podesta emails that came in every single morning and so we didn't know it was going to come out and again no smoking gun was in those emails other than a really good risotto recipe actually but I think that's the position they're in right now there just playing you know ketchup and reacting to each revelation where she has the tape and is playing a much longer game but you're saying that even the environment on the apprentice around the apprentice and even in the Trump Organization this kind of culture of Lies and distrust and all of this kind of clandestine kind of back and forward is how you every look without a doubt and you think about the kinds of people that Donald surrounds himself with you think about the the Michael Flynn's of the world you think about the Paul Manafort of the world and that's just what we've seen in the political context I've seen that in the business context think back to discussions about Trump University Trump Institute people that I was working with who had bad reputations think about Trump Baja Mexico worth thirty two point five million dollars of consumers invested in that property and never got their money back because Donald put his face on the building and then never delivered on the building and so there's a pattern that Donald has of surrounding himself with people who reflect who he is and I commonly heard in my travels during my year with the Trump Organization people who knew I was part of the trouble I know people that have gotten taken advantage of by Donald on how you could work with him well I'm gonna have to leave it there thank you Randall Pinkett and Zerlina Maxwell coming up in our next hour the possibility of a Donald Trump in word tape and
