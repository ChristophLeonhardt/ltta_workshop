1
00:00:01,496 --> 00:00:01,963
ISN'T ENOUGH.

2
00:00:01,963 --> 00:00:03,364
>> Bill: MORE THE COME FROM THE

3
00:00:03,364 --> 00:00:03,664
HILL.

4
00:00:03,664 --> 00:00:06,401
>> Sandra: LET'S BRING IN OUR

5
00:00:06,401 --> 00:00:07,034
HEADLINER NEWT GINGRICH.

6
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:08,035
FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE

7
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:10,872
AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "TRUMP'S

8
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:12,039
AMERICA" AND FOX NEWS

9
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:12,440
CONTRIBUTOR.

10
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,107
MR. SPEAKER, THANK YOU FOR

11
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:14,142
BEING HERE THIS MORNING AND

12
00:00:14,142 --> 00:00:15,443
YOU'RE HELPING US KICK OFF THE

13
00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:15,743
WEEK.

14
00:00:15,743 --> 00:00:17,345
IT WILL BE ALL ABOUT KAVANAUGH

15
00:00:17,345 --> 00:00:18,379
AND THE F.B.I. INVESTIGATION.

16
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:22,116
WHERE DO YOU SEE IT GOING?

17
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:23,384
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL

18
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:24,719
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR FIRST

19
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,019
YEAR.

20
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,288
IT HAS BEEN VERY, VERY

21
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:28,089
SUCCESSFUL AND I ALWAYS ENJOY

22
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:29,424
BEING WITH YOU AND BILL.

23
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:31,059
>> Sandra: THANK YOU.

24
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,861
>> LOOK, I THINK IT'S PRETTY

25
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:35,263
CLEAR IF PEOPLE ARE HONEST AND

26
00:00:35,263 --> 00:00:37,832
THEY LOOK AT FOLKS LIKE SENATOR

27
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:40,134
BOOKER SAYING YOU ARE COMPLICIT

28
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:43,204
WITH EVIL IF YOU'RE FOR

29
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:43,571
KAVANAUGH.

30
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:55,016
THEY LOOK AT SENATOR SAYING MEN

31
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:57,152
SHOULD SHUT UP AND YOU SEE

32
00:00:57,152 --> 00:00:58,086
WATERS SAYING DRIVE THEM OFF

33
00:00:58,086 --> 00:00:59,020
THE STREET.

34
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,288
YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PATTERNS

35
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:00,588
HERE.

36
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:02,290
THE REAL QUESTION IN THE 2018

37
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,691
ELECTION WILL BE WHAT KIND OF

38
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:05,325
AMERICA DO WE WANT TO BECOME?

39
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:06,961
THE LEFT -- I DON'T CARE WHAT

40
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,596
THE F.B.I. COMES UP WITH, IF

41
00:01:08,596 --> 00:01:11,800
THE F.B.I. COMES OUT AND SAYS

42
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,668
THERE IS ZERO EVIDENCE THAT

43
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:15,270
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DID ANYTHING

44
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,472
WRONG THE DEMOCRATS WILL

45
00:01:16,472 --> 00:01:18,574
PROMPTLY SAY AND SHIFTING TO

46
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:19,508
WHAT ABOUT DRINKING?

47
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:20,676
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

48
00:01:20,676 --> 00:01:21,176
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

49
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:23,479
I THINK YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

50
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:26,181
THEY ARE ENGAGED IN A SEARCH

51
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:27,583
AND DESTROY MISSION AS LINDSEY

52
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,251
GRAHAM SAID THE OTHER DAY

53
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:30,886
THAT'S DELIBERATE, NOT AN

54
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:32,287
ACCIDENT OR GAME.

55
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:33,922
THEY WANT POWER, AS PRESIDENT

56
00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:35,591
LINCOLN WARNED IN HIS COOPER

57
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:37,559
UNION ADDRESS, THEY WANT RULE

58
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:37,926
OR RUIN.

59
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:39,795
AND IF THEY HAVE TO RUIN THE

60
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:41,196
ENTIRE SYSTEM THEY'RE PREPARED

61
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:41,930
TO RUIN IT.

62
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,298
YOU ARE LIVING THROUGH IT.

63
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:45,868
I THINK REPUBLICANS HAVE GOT TO

64
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:47,302
GET AWAKE AND UNDERSTAND THIS

65
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:49,872
IS NOT SOME GAME AND IT IS NOT

66
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:51,040
BECAUSE SENATOR SCHUMER IS

67
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,142
CONFUSED.

68
00:01:53,142 --> 00:01:55,944
IT IS A DELIBERATE, VICIOUS,

69
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:56,879
WILLFUL CHARACTER ASSASSINATION.

70
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,981
>> Bill: TWO THINGS I JUST WANT

71
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:00,983
TO SHARE WITH OUR VIEWERS HERE.

72
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:02,518
I THINK TECHNICALLY THE CLOCK

73
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:04,620
IS RUNNING ON THE ONE MARK,

74
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,055
MCCONNELL CAME TO THE FLOOR

75
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:07,423
FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND SAID 51

76
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:09,324
REPUBLICANS HAVE VOTED YES TO

77
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:10,025
ADVANCE THE MOTION.

78
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:12,127
WHICH WOULD MEAN IF IT STARTED

79
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:13,762
ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON THIS COMING

80
00:02:13,762 --> 00:02:15,864
FRIDAY THAT'S WHEN WE START TO

81
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:17,266
GO INTO THE SENATE PROCEDURES

82
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:19,168
WHICH WOULD TAKE US PROBABLY

83
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:20,169
THROUGH THE WEEKEND I'M

84
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:21,503
GUESSING WHICH WOULD SET US UP

85
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:22,671
FOR THE FOLLOWING MONDAY OR

86
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:24,073
TUESDAY BASED ON THE CALENDAR.

87
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:26,408
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU AGREE OR

88
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:26,875
NOT.

89
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,244
ORRIN HATCH SENT OUT A TWEET

90
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:31,113
QUITE FASCINATING THE SEE THE

91
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:32,748
SUDDEN INTEREST FROM SENATE

92
00:02:32,748 --> 00:02:36,018
DEMOCRATS AFTER THEY PREVENTED

93
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:38,787
THE F.B.I. FROM INVESTIGATING

94
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:39,822
FOR SIX WEEKS.

95
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:41,123
BILL CASSIDY CHARACTERIZED IT A

96
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:41,623
DIFFERENT WAY.

97
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:42,758
BEAR IN MIND WHAT THE COUNTRY

98
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:44,193
HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH FOR THE

99
00:02:44,193 --> 00:02:46,729
PAST TWO YEARS AND THE #METOO

100
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:47,229
MOVEMENT.

101
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:49,798
HE SAID THIS, MR. SPEAKER.

102
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,500
>> DEMOCRATS HAVE WEAPONIZED

103
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,068
THE #METOO MOVEMENT WHICH IS

104
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:53,369
AWFUL.

105
00:02:53,369 --> 00:02:55,171
IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO STOP THE

106
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:57,039
SORT OF BEHAVIOR WE'VE SEEN

107
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,842
LIKE HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND BILL

108
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:00,543
COSBY.

109
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:01,243
NOW IT'S WEAPONIZED.

110
00:03:01,243 --> 00:03:03,145
ONE PERSON MAKING A CLAIM WHICH

111
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:04,180
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO DR. FORD,

112
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,948
SHE STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT.

113
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:07,616
NO ONE ELSE CORROBORATES.

114
00:03:07,616 --> 00:03:09,952
>> Bill: THERE IS A LOT IN HERE

115
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,722
AND TAKE  IT IN A MOMENT.

116
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:15,825
GIVEN THE WAY THE LAWYERS FOR

117
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:17,727
DR. FORD REALLY NEGOTIATED WITH

118
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:20,162
CHUCK GRASSLEY TO GET HER

119
00:03:20,162 --> 00:03:22,264
BEFORE THAT COMMITTEE, DO WE

120
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:23,933
THINK THAT DR. FORD'S ATTORNEYS

121
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:25,568
WILL ALLOW THIS F.B.I.

122
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,502
INTERVIEW TO HAPPEN?

123
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:29,305
OR WILL THEY SET CONDITIONS UP

124
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:30,940
FOR THAT INTERVIEW?

125
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,808
WHICH IN ALL LIKELIHOOD IF THAT

126
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:34,343
HAPPENS THIS BLOWS PAST THIS

127
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:37,413
COMING FRIDAY.

128
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:40,917
>> I THINK THEY HAVE A

129
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:41,417
DIFFERENT PROBLEM.

130
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,719
THEY ARE FACED WITH THE VERY

131
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,289
REAL POSSIBILITY -- FIRST OF

132
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,491
ALL, ANY TWO REPUBLICANS CAN

133
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:51,194
STOP PROCEDURE ON FRIDAY.

134
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:53,129
MCCONNELL MAY HAVE SCHEDULED IT

135
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:56,065
BUT IF FOR ONE REASON OR

136
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:56,933
ANOTHER.

137
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:58,134
ANOTHER ELEVATOR INCIDENT.

138
00:03:58,134 --> 00:03:59,035
INCIDENT AT A RESTAURANT.

139
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:00,670
WHO REPUBLICANS GO I'M NOT

140
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,772
SURE, THEN FRIDAY DISAPPEARS,

141
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:03,039
TOO.

142
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,775
SECOND, REMEMBER, THIS WHOLE

143
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:07,744
THING IS VERY WEIRD.

144
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:09,645
SHE WAS APPARENTLY HIDING AT

145
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:12,648
HER PARENTS' BEACH HOUSE IN

146
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:13,583
DELAWARE, WHICH DEMOCRATIC

147
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,150
STAFFERS KNEW THAT.

148
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,053
THE WHOLE THING HAS BEEN A

149
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:18,821
MANIPULATED, DELIBERATE PROCESS

150
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,623
DESIGNED, FRANKLY, TO DRIVE IT

151
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:22,592
PAST THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS AND

152
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:24,360
TO KEEP KAVANAUGH OFF OF THE

153
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,697
CURRENT COURT WHICH STARTS

154
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:27,997
TODAY.

155
00:04:27,997 --> 00:04:29,666
SO I'M VERY DOUBTFUL THAT WE'RE

156
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,901
SEEING ANYTHING LIKE FAIR PLAY

157
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:33,169
OR THAT ANYBODY SHOULD RELAX

158
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:34,738
AND BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING HAS

159
00:04:34,738 --> 00:04:36,640
BEEN AGREED TO AT THE PRESENT

160
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:36,940
TIME.

161
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,175
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL LET HER

162
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:41,411
TALK OR NOT BECAUSE THE F.B.I.

163
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:45,282
-- IF YOU LOOK AT THE REPORT BY

164
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:46,449
THE WOMAN PROSECUTOR FROM

165
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:47,617
PHOENIX WHO CAME AND

166
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:49,486
INTERVIEWED HER, SHE IS PRETTY

167
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:52,289
DEVASTATING IN SAYING YOU KNOW,

168
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:53,690
SHE COULDN'T CORROBORATE THIS,

169
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,491
THIS OR THIS.

170
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:56,526
I JUST TWEETED OUT THE ENTIRE

171
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:58,962
LETTER SHE SENT THE REPUBLICANS

172
00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:00,597
AND YOU LOOK AT THAT.

173
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:03,867
THE FACT IS DR. FORD PROBABLY

174
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,502
HAD SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HER.

175
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:08,305
THE QUESTION IS, IS HER MEMORY

176
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:11,141
36 YEARS LATER ACCURATE AND SHE

177
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:12,075
HAS ZERO CORROBORATION AND A

178
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:14,177
WHOLE LOT OF HOLES IN HER STORY.

179
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:16,046
YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT

180
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:18,782
BECAUSE YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO

181
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:20,450
TAKE ON THE PERSON IN A DIRECT

182
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,786
WAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT THE

183
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:23,653
CURRENT APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR,

184
00:05:23,653 --> 00:05:27,257
BUT AT WHAT POINT DO YOU ALLOW

185
00:05:27,257 --> 00:05:28,892
THIS GUY, THIS FATHER, THIS

186
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:32,562
HUSBAND, THIS SON TO BE

187
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:34,030
DESTROYED ON THE UNSUPPORTED

188
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,432
ALLEGATION OF A SINGLE PERSON

189
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:37,300
ABOUT A HIGH SCHOOL INCIDENT 36

190
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,402
YEARS AGO FOR WHICH SHE HAS

191
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:41,538
BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER ZERO

192
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:41,972
CORROBORATION?

193
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:42,939
AND I THINK IT WILL BE

194
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:43,640
INTERESTING TO WATCH.

195
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,275
IF THE F.B.I. COMES BACK AND

196
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,177
SAYS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG,

197
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:48,912
THE DEMOCRATS BY FRIDAY WILL

198
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:51,381
HAVE FIVE NEW CHARGES.

199
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:53,016
>> Sandra: MR. SPEAKER, YOU

200
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:53,717
STARTED OUT BY SAYING

201
00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:55,385
REPUBLICANS NEED TO WAKE UP.

202
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:56,787
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

203
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:59,656
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE

204
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:00,791
REPUBLICANS DO HERE?

205
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,459
NOW WE'RE WEEKS AWAY FROM

206
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,160
MID-TERM ELECTIONS.

207
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,096
WHAT SHOULD BE THE STRATEGY?

208
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:10,501
>> I THINK OTHER HE VERY

209
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:10,968
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

210
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:12,603
THE 2018 ELECTION IS ABOUT

211
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:14,838
WHICH AMERICA DO WE WANT TO

212
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:15,172
BECOME.

213
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:17,541
DO WE WANT TO BE AN AMERICA

214
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,409
WHERE PEOPLE RUSH INTO YOUR

215
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:21,044
RESTAURANT AND INVADE YOUR

216
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:21,512
PERSONAL SPACE.

217
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:23,380
AN AMERICA WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE

218
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,216
SMEARED AND DESTROYED ON

219
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:26,817
TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED

220
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:27,184
BEHAVIOR?

221
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:28,085
DO WE WANT TO BE AN AMERICA

222
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:29,486
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS USED AS

223
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:31,121
A WEAPON TO MAKE YOU CHANGE

224
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:31,522
YOUR LIFE?

225
00:06:31,522 --> 00:06:32,856
THAT'S WHERE THE LEFT IS.

226
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:33,957
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

227
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:35,159
YOU SEE THIS THIS MORNING, BY

228
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,560
THE WAY, IN THE GREAT NEWS

229
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,096
ABOUT THE DEAL WITH MEXICO AND

230
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:39,597
CANADA.

231
00:06:39,597 --> 00:06:40,598
YOU HAVE A RESULTS-ORIENTED

232
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:44,802
TEAM LED BY TRUMP AND A

233
00:06:44,802 --> 00:06:48,305
RESISTANCE-ORIENTED TEAM LED BY

234
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:48,839
PELOSI AND SCHUMER.

235
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,641
REPUBLICANS OUGHT TO SAY WE'RE

236
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:54,778
TRYING TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN

237
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,080
FROM FENTANYL AND OPIOID DEATHS.

238
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,081
THE DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE.

239
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:59,216
THEY ARE WILLING TO HAVE A

240
00:06:59,216 --> 00:07:02,553
TOTALLY OPEN BORDER EVEN IF IT

241
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:03,721
MEANS MORE FENTANYL AND OPIOID

242
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:04,054
DEATHS.

243
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:05,589
WE NEED TO BE AS BLUNT,

244
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:07,458
EMOTIONAL AND DIRECT AS OUR

245
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,225
DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS OR THEY'LL

246
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:09,093
RUN OVER US.

247
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:11,662
>> Bill: YOU WROTE A PIECE

248
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:14,231
ABOUT THE BLUE WAVES IN GEORGIA.

249
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:18,269
I WANT TO SHARE A CLIP FROM THE

250
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:20,371
"WASHINGTON POST" ARTICLE,

251
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:22,039
NUMBER 6.

252
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,975
THE QUESTIONS FACING DEMOCRATS

253
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:27,044
AND SOME REPUBLICANS AS THE

254
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:30,281
CAMPAIGN BEGINS IN EARNEST,

255
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:31,916
SHOULD THEY ATTACK TRUMP OR

256
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,518
CRAFT A MORE UPLIFTING MESSAGE

257
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:35,286
OF THEIR OWN, END QUOTE?

258
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:37,255
THIS HAS BEEN DEBATED NOW.

259
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:38,823
IT IS CRUNCH TIME TO MAKE A

260
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:39,190
DECISION.

261
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,926
WHAT DO THEY DO?

262
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:44,228
>> WELL, IF THE DEMOCRATS CAN'T

263
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:46,497
GET AWAY FROM BEING THE

264
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:47,532
RESISTANCE PARTY IT IS WHAT

265
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:50,134
THEY SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS

266
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:52,470
ON, IT STARTED ELECTION NIGHT.

267
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,105
AND MY PREDICTION, I DID THIS

268
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:56,674
-- I WROTE A SMALL PAPER THAT'S

269
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:58,576
ON AMAZON ON THE 2018 ELECTION

270
00:07:58,576 --> 00:08:01,312
AND I STARTED BY LINKING TO AN

271
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:02,613
INTERVIEW I DID WITH MEGYN

272
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:04,615
KELLY TWO WEEKS BEFORE AT THE

273
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:05,550
ELECTION LAST TIME WHEN

274
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,951
EVERYBODY KNEW TRUMP WAS GOING

275
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:07,652
TO LOSE.

276
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:09,988
PEOPLE TEND TO FORGET THIS.

277
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:11,189
EVERYBODY KNEW TRUMP WAS GOING

278
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,656
TO LOSE.

279
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:14,258
I THINK THE ODDS ARE EVEN

280
00:08:14,258 --> 00:08:15,660
MONEY, ELECTION NIGHT 2018 WILL

281
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,129
BE AN EVEN WORSE SHOCK FOR THE

282
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:19,364
LEFT THAN 2016 WAS.

283
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:21,466
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WANT OPEN

284
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:21,799
BORDERS.

285
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:24,569
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WANT

286
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:25,737
TOLERANCE FOR FENTANYL ON

287
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:26,204
OPIOID DEATHS.

288
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,573
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WANT GIANT

289
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:29,040
TAX INCREASES.

290
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,843
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WANT TO

291
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:38,448
SEE MOBS RUNNING AROUND

292
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:39,616
INTIMIDATING AND PEOPLE AND I

293
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:42,386
THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE WEAK

294
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:43,822
GOING INTO THE LAST FIVE WEEKS.

295
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:45,090
>> Sandra: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

296
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,891
A DIFFERENT BLUE WAVE.

297
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:48,093
THE BLUE WAVE OF LIBERAL

298
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:51,930
FUNDING.

299
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,666
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

300
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,469
YOU HAVE BILLIONAIRES OUT HERE

301
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:58,203
WRITING $100 MILLION CHECKS

302
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:00,672
WHICH IS AN EFFORT.

303
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:01,706
I'M AN OPTIMIST ABOUT THE

304
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:04,642
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE SAW IT

305
00:09:04,642 --> 00:09:07,379
HAPPEN IN SOUTH TEXAS IS A

306
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,246
STUNNING VICTORY IN A DISTRICT

307
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,315
WE HAVE NOT HAD IN THE STATE

308
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:12,083
SENATE IN 139 YEARS.

309
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:17,689
WE WON IN A DISTRICT 63%

310
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:18,056
HISPANIC.

311
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:20,492
WE WON A VICTORY ON BIG ISSUES

312
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:22,827
BECAUSE WE HAD A GREAT

313
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:23,995
CANDIDATE WHO FIT THE DISTRICT,

314
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:24,929
CAMPAIGNED ON BIG ISSUES.

315
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:26,664
HE SAID I WANT TO CONTROL THE

316
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,967
BORDER TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

317
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:33,905
I WANT TO MAKE SURE -- HE SAID

318
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:37,642
I OPPOSE THE DEMOCRAT EFFORTS

319
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:38,576
TO TAX-PAID ABORTION.

320
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:40,178
I WANT LOWER TAXES, MORE TAKE

321
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:41,613
HOME PAY, MORE JOBS.

322
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:43,515
HE LIKES THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE

323
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:45,617
THE BEST ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A

324
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:47,018
HALF CENTURY AND THE DEMOCRAT

325
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:48,653
HAD NOT MUCH TO BALANCE THAT

326
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:49,020
OFF WITH.

327
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,958
IF YOU RUN AS THE PARTY OF TAX

328
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,293
PAID ABORTION, THE PARTY OF AN

329
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,494
OPEN BOARD.

330
00:09:56,494 --> 00:10:00,231
LOOK AT GAVIN NEWSOM RUNNING

331
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:01,866
FOR GOVERNOR IN CALIFORNIA.

332
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:04,669
HE WANTS TO GET FREE HEALTHCARE

333
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:05,837
TO ANY IMMIGRANT.

334
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:07,339
THAT'S A MAGNET FOR EVERY SICK

335
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,041
PERSON ON THE PLANET TO GO TO

336
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:10,775
CALIFORNIA SO CALIFORNIA

337
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:11,943
TAXPAYERS CAN PAY FOR THEM AND

338
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:13,345
IT WILL DESTROY THE CALIFORNIA

339
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:14,846
HEALTH SYSTEM.

340
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:15,881
THIS IS THE MINDLESS STUFF YOU

341
00:10:15,881 --> 00:00:00,000
GET FROM THE LEFT.
