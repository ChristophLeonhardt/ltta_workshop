so recently Donald Trump referred to undocumented immigrants as animals that was in response to a question about ms-13 now and his answer he didn't clarify ms-13 and he talked about how they were turning away a lot of people at the border it seemed like it was a more general response than that specific question about ms-13 but look I know that the Republicans are snowflakes and so they get their feelings hurt and they're like no all right it doesn't matter because Trump's gonna clarify so he's gonna say a number of things here and I'm going to give you that facts the reality is about ms-13 they are terrible Goering and and they do commit atrocities which Trump is gonna share with you in a second and but I'll give you the real numbers as to the scope of the problem so first let's hear out Trump today they exploited the loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors they look so innocent they're not innocent so now let's be clear he's talking about minors he just said it so he's talking about kids immigrant kids they look innocent but they're not why we have to do you mean humanize them and the and the people that we have the most sympathy towards our kids they look so cute we're hardwired to actually not do violence against one another of course we've had terrible violence throughout human history and that is also part of our wiring but overall in there's great Studies on this art instinct isn't to not do it in fact in World War one an enormous percentage of people would not fire on the other side right but when it comes to kids were particularly against doing violence which is great that's great but fascists don't like that they want you to hate another group they got a demagogue there the problem is that other group has kids just like we have kids but they're in that's why Trump like all good fascists has to come and go they're not innocent they're not kids they're monsters it's okay let's crush the kids too so now he's gonna connect them to ms-13 watch I notice recently where Democrats Nancy Pelosi as an example are trying to defend ms-13 gang members I called them animals the other day and I was met with rebuked they said they're people you know people these are animals and we have to be very very so there he is in Long Island where ms-13 has done terrible violence and he's gonna tell you about that I'm gonna tell you about that let's clarify a couple of things first off Nancy Pelosi is not defending ms-13 Nancy Boza is a thousand problems that ain't one of them and no one no one in the country is defending ms-13 that's a total lie he says that because he's like oh yeah well you know they are saying that I said that ms-13 is animal no they're saying that you called undocumented immigrants animals that's what they're criticizing not your comments about ms-13 so total line okay but much more importantly he's doing the old Dick Cheney trick how did they get us into the Iraq war well seventy percent of Americans thought at the time that we started the Iraq war that Saddam Hussein had personally attacked us on 9/11 he hadn't Saddam didn't do it it was Al Qaeda that did it and now Qaeda and Saddam Hussein were enemies now I they couldn't say that with a straight face so what would Cheney and Bush always do they would come out and say 9/11 Saddam Hussein 9/11 Saddam Hussein I didn't say Saddam Hussein did 9/11 although Cheney sometimes would say that but Bush was careful not to say it but he would put them in the same sentence over and over and over again as usual like in this case largely unchallenged by the media so it left people with the impression that oh this Saddam Hussein mustard on 9/11 think Cheney famously once said on Meet the Press that our attackers on 9/11 came from the same region of the world as Iraq what that was at me they came 15 out of 19 ever more from Saudi Arabia which is a great ally of Dick Cheney but he wanted you to attack Iraq so this is an old demagoguing trick and he's doing it here he's going kids ms-13 kids ms-13 ah their kids are not innocent these other company minors are not innocent ms-13 okay now he's not done yet so he if you in order to drive the demagogy home what you want to do is you intelligence trous stories they're not people they're monsters now the stories he's gonna tell it with the exception of one of them are true then I'll give you the context let's watch they killed a cop for the sake of making a statement they want to make a statement so they killed a cop policeman ms-13 gang members were charged with killing and hacking up a teenage four other young men were brutally murdered recently by ms-13 in Suffolk ms-13 gang members are accused of stabbing a man 100 times decapitating him and ripping out his heart ms-13 members beat a sex trafficked 15 year-old girl with a bat 28 times totally disfiguring a beautiful young woman two ms-13 gang members were charged after kidnapping drugging and raping a 14 year old girl they then murdered her and somebody else all right two important points here the one he was lying about was the cop the cop was not killed in fact Long Island police after Trump said this came out and clarified no there was a threat against one of our cops but no cop was actually killed now does the President or anyone on his team ever do homework no do they mind lying not at all they're like who cares let's just say he killed a cop and move on do they have to lie no ms-13 does terrible things the other things that he read are true by the way you know who else does terrible things other gangs including other Latino gangs other black gangs other white gangs we did a story recently on the show Mississippi has more white gangs than all other gangs combined they've never used the gang law against any white gang member in Mississippi they only use it against black gang members okay so it's selective enforcement in that case this case it's selective propaganda so he doesn't focus on any of the other gangs he doesn't focus on any of the crimes all he does is immigrants ms-13 immigrant kids ms-13 ms-13 terrible terrible crimes so now you might think oh my god damn is 13 probably has committed thousands upon thousands of crimes it's a plague across the country and we and it's probably the majority of immigrants given how much he's talking about it right so let's actually look at the numbers so as a professor at Fordham Law School John faff explains ms-13 is responsible for 207 murders since 2012 that's a lot guys that's 207 murders from just one gang in six years so don't underestimate that they're terrible Gary okay now let's give you context between 2012 and 2016 there were over 76,000 murders in the u.s. so huh what's the percentage then that means ms-13 is responsible for less than 0.3 percent of all US murders during that time but even point three percent is pretty high for one gang but having said that the way that Trump says it it sounds like it's ninety-nine point seven percent and so the point three percent it doesn't seem like a small percentage of the kind of crime it seems like a huge percentage of the crime the way that he constantly talks about it and drills at home but to me what's even more important is what is the percentage of the kids that are coming into unaccompanied minors that are coming in that are ms-13 cuz he seemed to paint it they're like wow I mean a lot of Omar ms-13 I mean they look like they're innocent these kids but they're not they're ms-13 so are they ms-13 let's find out as New York Daily News reports Carlos provost's the acting chief of the u.s. Border Patrol that's a person in the Trump administration head of the Border Patrol noted during the Senate testimony last summer how seldom gang members are caught among the unaccompanied minors crossing the border from Mexico so it's not a common occurrence it's a very rare occur but if you're wondering hey Jake what are the actual numbers hold cuz I have them so I'm glad you asked so the 250,000 children apprehended between 2011 and the summer of 2017 a hundred and fifty nine had or were suspected of having gang affiliations hmm that seems like a pretty small percentage but look I'll break it down further for you okay 159 okay of those only 56 were suspected of affiliation or confirmed to be members of ms-13 Provo set again Provost is the chief of the u.s. Border Patrol under Trump so even as own administration admits there's only 56 ms-13 miners that came in their country out of 250,000 kids that came in so what is that percentage 0.02 percent not 2% not 0.2% point Oh 2% so it is a minuscule minuscule percentage of the kids that are coming into this country that are ms-13 but the way Trump says it oh my god the kids coming in here they're not innocent there are ms-13 they're ms-13 0.02% 99.98% are not ms-13 so one last review here of the unaccompanied kids coming into the country over that period of time 56 or ms-13 103 were from other gangs 249,000 841 or just kids this is how you demonize people and dehumanize them so that you could do terrible monstrous things to them and that is exactly what Donald Trump's goal is and that is why he plays these rhetorical tricks it's meant to get you to hate the immigrants that are coming in and their kids that's why he's such a terrible person you Turks two easy ways for Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos
