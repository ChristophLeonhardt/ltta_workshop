well anger is running high in the city where people have gathered at the headquarters of the regional government they're demanding answers and justice for the victims more people are expected to rally today and the crowd has been repeatedly chanting the word truth the region has declared three days of mourning the Blood Moon Putin made flowers at a makeshift memorial at the shopping center he also visited survivors at a local hospital and said that the tragedy brings me mixed emotions when you hear for the first time how many people died the children died you don't just want to cry you want to scream but after you hear what's happening here frankly you feel very different just as good or more in the situation in Canberra I'm joined live on the program by Murat desde of one of the pieces there of the president speaking in perhaps a more somber mood looking back at what occurred we also heard him in a very very frustrated angry mood as well didn't we with officials with with people who he feels are to blame for the tragedy that unfolded on Sunday well Putin Putin was very direct he he said it when he was talking to people who had lost loved ones he said you know speaking to them they tell you things that make you want to cry that are absolutely horrendous and then I'm talking to you he says to officials and you're telling me a completely different story and here you know here you have the the classic picture where they're presumably trying to protect themselves painting it all very differently but Putin said straight forward that those that are responsible for this those involved in this will be punished mr. many budem do you know what it is to chu'lak still which we have on the program that is that is what people they're demanding they're demanding accountability they're demanding communication because they say there has been a complete breakdown that officials took their time with everything that they keeping people in the dark that the fire service was very slow to react and when they finally got there they spent a while preparing you know the rescue operation itself was subpar to say the least this is what people are saying on the other hand it is important as Putin said all those responsible will be punished heads will roll but we've we've gotta wait we've got to investigate we've got a look at what actually happened we can't jump to conclusions here and according to the brief that he was given the fire alarm itself was deactivated and he was either deactivated or malfunctioning and it had mean so for more than a week since the 19th nevertheless security had a backup system a backup system which all they had to do is press a button and it would have worked it would have warned people that something was wrong they didn't press that from whatever reason whether they knew about this button whether you know the security personnel were responsible for this had done something else because there had been a breakdown and absolutely everything everything that could have been gone wrong went wrong the doors on the fire exits the doors in the cinema and the screen rooms themselves they had been locked they'd be locked reasoning behind number is that it just purely because they didn't want people coming in with tickets all right without tickets and coming into the room it seems an over-the-top way to do that to stop people coming in locking a group of people this was a cartoon so mainly children in a well there you go there was supposed to be someone on the door this is how these things usually done there's someone on the door they check tickets and they sit there for the duration of the movie in this case they had better things to do obviously they lock them all those people in there and they went out and you had kids cooling that parent's begging them to come rescue them to come help them and they kept calling and calling and calling until the calls stopped and this is what you must understand about this protest as I call it Igor's that have said there are people there but everybody who drive is far past honks they were all down their windows they shout messages and support this is a city on the edge there there agonised there there absolutely you know devastated in anguish this is a huge loss a tragedy that borders on a catastrophe and its sheer size and scope and earlier on I put together a report to get to know some of the victims a little better because names and names and lists and lists and numbers and numbers but when you know that the people there that died just like you and I well it adds much more depth to this tragedy and I must more view as some of this report may be distressing for rural youngsters a visit to the big city he's always an adventure these twelve year old classmates went to town and they went bowling ice skating to the cinema it would be their last adventure this class dignity upon you a particular go many dozens and dozens dead but they aren't just numbers they all had names lives who the compensation and the world won't recover their families loss especially given that so many of the victims were children Masha was there with her grandmother she only turned ten last week and posted this photo online exactly a decade is all she got in this world both she and her grandmother perished Tatyana an English teacher she was there with her daughter who survived that jana got her out of the building before hearing that others were still trapped she went to help rescue who she could strangers but she never came back out you were the best teacher in the world writer former students you didn't deserve this we will all remember you see each other for missus it's me on all the students oh god it's not this point if you did little rat Ybor pictured here with his mum and dad she wasn't with them but imagine her pain when she had to identify the bodies of her child and husband not even surviving is easy some say he jumped others that his father threw him out of the window in a desperate effort to save his little boy before succumbing to the smoke himself we won't know until Sega wakes up from his coma alone his parents and little sister there are too many to mention here but the point is made a list of names is one thing but it's only when you get to know them just a little that the depth of this tragedy really hits you I want to take us now back to live pictures in camera ver where a father of three no deceased children is speaking let's listen to what this man has to say it's not the ramaya logic bar and the file that was there it killed a lot of people in that bar it's the different place it's a big building the investigation is being protracted dragging it out the capital of our region would have a lot of capabilities to address such emergencies there were no helicopters to come to the side literally nothing there was nothing maybe because we realized there was no use in helicopters it all comes down to the way they try to extinguish the fire blaze say there was some playgrounds some cinema halls and some people lost maybe we'll find more we'll treat them and everything but the whole building was on fire I was at the headquarters of the rescue operation a lot of people in the old building people who suffered throughout this tragedy most of the people injured suffered because of that place they were coming from the cinema halls they were trapped there the fire was about 1,000 square meters I was coming to the city at ten o'clock and I saw emergency vehicles and the ambulances going back and forth but see the fire was in full blast I saw the bodies currently kept in the morgue well they're trying to identify them the bodies the fragments I think they're like 30 people still not identified but as we have different figures about 300 people are still not identified they died but no one is showing that this is true when showing their bodies information is coming is pouring out I've been watching the videos in the internet some say I saw that much as people others so I saw that much that many as far as we know the senior one was fooled so that's the person who been voting for channel 1 and TV these are the people can be trust them should which was these figures the figures they are giving about 64 people is just well-versed language might not have nothing with reality we would like to know if the toll is above 150 if it is so then all the authorities all the officials should be acts in fact if immediately because that is in evidence a direct testimony to the fact that they are not performing their duties in no way at all we are living here we're not well-off we're just ordinary citizens and we would like to have far more than that stage in do something to get some bit of information came here to get some answers and ice and I heard about the position that we all can get clear to come to the MOG to every other place with the bodies with the people have been treated after the accidents that's the preposition we heard and I agree that is necessary we gathered a group of people to go there they saw just the very thing they wanted to show them those figures that yes the figures match is what they say but this is exactly what is we have seen this is a persons we've been voting for they this kind of a scheme they're trying to carry out they say let's get a group and bust that group to do every place let's go to the marks and to hospitals Lee asked us to believe them but should we should we believe that's how it's sometimes done in our country sometimes people have been brainwashed instead of being given real information okay well that's feed just went down there but you can sense the clear anger the clear frustration from a person really getting since the death of that man's character I should reiterate he lost three children in the blaze he is not believing what he is being told he says and the situation is of course though is that nobody knows right now what the exact figures out what we can go with and I need to stress that these are the official figures that we know that 64 people were killed in the inferno in the mall but that person that father and other men like him demanding answers demanding more than what they are hearing from authorities but understandably grief you know that you can only imagine what he has been going through the past 24 hours and what his life is going to be like in the coming months as well and we can actually cross live again now to the Siberian city of camera Igor Asia done off has been standing by to bring us off the dare give us more of us of what's happening in the city sadness anger frustration fear it's a very tough day there Igor well yes Union the whole city is aching it is not exactly the smallest city but not the largest - so for many families here what this is what happened it has affected them on a personal level this why all of these people were getting reports of thousands from the looks of it it looks like it looks like it is thousands of people have shown to this square to demand answers to demand justice those who couldn't make it there honking rolling down their windows yelling chance of support and the main reason why they are here and you've heard really the man is people think that the actual number of dead in the fire is being lowered by the local authorities the official figure stands at 64 people but they believe that as many as hundreds of people may have perished in that Inferno now the Russian Investigative Committee of course is looking into this and they've released the lists of both dead and missing and the local authorities have called on everyone who thinks that there's somebody else who's not on that on those lists to step forward - to give the names - for the search to begin but many many people are disenchanted and they're of course very frustrated they're devastated by the fact that this tragedy occurred in the first place because it could have been avoided if not the faulty if not the faulty fire prevention system and I mean they are asking questions how is that that there was no alarm how is that possible that sprinklers did not work how's that possible that people had to break down fire escapes the very paths that are supposed to lead people to safety in an emergency situation all of these questions are unanswered in fact we've heard chants for the governor of the camera of a region to resign and the crowd shared to those chants and so all of these people all of these people they are demanding justice and of course everyone's we've talked to be who survived the blaze and they're saying everyone's experience and different is different but some are saying that well in fact often people didn't know what to do and people security guards on the ground in the shopping mall didn't really help have a listen cinema stuff didn't let me through they pushed me my daughter asked me why no one was saving her I asked the fireman to do something but he just stared at me I run to the third floor firemen stood there do nothing in front of the door my daughter told me that she loved me and that she was suffocating I told her to get down on the floor and begged her not to die the children are there it isn't a matter of how many are dead now unless we change something hundreds of others could die no matter how long we stand here no matter how loud we shout no one will hear us now if Latimer Putin landed here in camera of early morning and he's laid flowers to the vigil outside the shopping mall and he talked to some of the citizens to comfort in the moment of their loss he's promised that every question will be answered that every person responsible for the tragedy will be brought to justice but the Investigative Committee has so far detained five people in connection with the tragedy no charges have been pressed yet but they are questioning the owner of the shopping mall and the fire safety chief as well the preliminary they've also arrested one of the security guards they've detained one of the security guards they believe that it was him who switched off the fire prevention system hence therefore it didn't work so they're questioning him as well we're here in camera and we will be bringing you all the latest throughout the day from this rally we'll be talking to people to get their mood to get their reaction and of course we're following the investigation as well Arty's Igor had done off live from camera thank you very much for that Rutgers D was also in the studio with me at listening in to that in Doubront we've been listening to people and speaking throughout the day some of them have been directly affected by the tragedy we've been listening to other authorities I think we need to just stress here as well that this is a situation where a huge area has been burnt to the ground and as gruesome as it sounds there are charred remains of people people without ID it's going to be a mammoth task to get a final death toll for everybody who died here to let their family actually get the bodies home so that they can mourn but it's not as easy as just saying give us the figures because this is going to take quite a while to discover just too many people actually perished in what is one of the biggest fires in the past 100 years in Russia look it's it's is the father of three children who perished in this tragedy said they don't believe local officials they say the real death toll is being understated they say that you know this information is false and we shouldn't trust what authorities are telling us he said that you know often that is a problem in Russia in our country that people are brainwashed or given false information and I not try and tackle it head-on this is what he said and I quote we are not going to hide and conceal anything he's aware that this is an issue and he's going to he says he wants to get the truth we're talking here about different levels and as the man said you know about brainwashing and being given false information often you have local officials who trying to protect themselves from central authorities in Moscow from the prime minister from the president they will sometimes understate casualties they will and this statement what happen the scope the horror of what happens whatever tragedy happens in order to protect themselves as Putin said you know Here I am talking to people who had lost loved ones and they tell you things that make you want to cry that are absolutely devastating and then when I talk to you the officials you tell me a completely different story a completely different story in which they're presumably trying to cover their own hides Putin said the heads were wrong but everybody responsible for this will be punished that every official who could have been involved with this whose actions could have led to this where their actions their activities will be evaluated and everybody responsible will be punished but as you said and as Ratna Putin said we can't jump to conclusions he made the promise that everybody will be punished two weeks to be punished but it is early days yet the sheer size and scope of the search the rescuers at the site their rescuers they're still digging up thinking of bodies presumably the little because the roof had collapsed that isn't a huge structure they're still trying to identify the bodies we don't know how many there are exactly the authorities are only releasing the body count that they've established the missing people that they've established locals there say that there are many more but we simply don't know and as experience tells me in particular because of you know I often work with down jets passenger liners there that a fallen bus crashes many you know many many tragedies and always you have room as a speculation at first about what caused the the truth behind them there's like I need people have a psychological need do to understand straight away to justify something to paint a picture to have it is very difficult for people to say especially when you've lost loved ones especially when you've got emotions at play when you've got a personal stake in something it's very difficult to say hold on a second you know I'll wait and I'll wait for the official results of the investigation I'll wait for some more concrete data you know the human mind works differently it needs to fill this void it needs to fill this gap it needs to vent frustration to vent anger to vent sadness unfortunately this is just human reaction and us sitting here talking about this isn't good it isn't going to change anything but this was this was horrible this was horrific given that so many of the casualties were children so many of those trapped but the doors had been locked they had locked the doors and the screen rooms I mean that is the it is a inexcusable as Vladimir Putin said you know heads heads will roll for this this was negligent negligence this was absolute carelessness and those responsible will be punished but it will happen incredibly quickly and will happen so fast and it is one of the things with these fires they spread they go out of control and it isn't the fire that kills you it's more likely the smoke unless you can get out unless you can flee and it was incredibly hard to do in this in this place with all the narrow corridors but I believe we have a timeline timeline of how events on this horrific day unfolded bilis partner Daniel Gordon Percy consider in the future Loyola do you get up hmph I'm missing working show you now are some drone pictures from this scene it it may help us understand the ferocity of the blaze the scale of the devastation the surrounding streets from here they're still blocked off and we can see clearly that the roof has collapsed look at this size about 16 square meters 1,600 square meters of devastation on that fourth floor cooling into the third of course and collapsing on the on the lower floors as well inside the building well there you go it's completely burned out we can see the emergency teams working there took a little bit of time for them to get in on Sunday evening as the as the flames the smoke was just so bad it took some time for them to come in and we also discussed this situation with a civil engineering expert he is of the belief the camera of the blaze shows systemic problems with fire safety in shopping malls I consider that as a national disaster for Russia most probably there was a problem with the building code most probably there was a problem with the material that they have used over there and for particularly the areas that the kids are there we need to have a special repercussion and special system and the fire exit and that because kids are not operating like us this is a systems problem you could have regulation on the books but when it comes to the enforcement of regulation and compliance with the regulation this is where the disparity happens residents of Khem River have organized a vigil to commemorate the victims of the tragedy people pay the respects of the memorial right throughout the night a lot of flowers a lot of candles and toys as well being laid there in the camera fur we also saw yesterday and indeed on Sunday evening queues of people outside clinics polyclinics hospitals willing to give blood for those injured in the blaze lots more help coming into this city as well we've just heard the Russian Red Cross is heavily engaged in raising funds for those in need as a result of the tragedy yesterday the Russian Red Cross announced a fundraiser to help out those affected by the incident people have responded extremely well they are not indifferent to the suffering of others as of today we've raised over 14 million roubles from all over Russia and also from abroad too we greatly thank those who've contributed okay Marat Castilla is sitting in as well and we've just been watching throughout the day Marat I was there we saw the pictures of a vigil there's a rally ongoing now people demanding what they see as more information that authorities are giving them the authorities themselves saying listen the pictures from the scene there's so much devastation there it's so difficult to tell how many people are dead how many people are injured because there are rescue is still working at the scene it goes back to the question but why this occurred why are we seeing the scenes that we're seeing not well first first of all there's you know all the anguish all the people you have three fractions in this as unpleasant as it is to talk about this now but it must be said this is the way I see it you have the locals people in camera camera who want accountability who want information who want to be notified to know what is going on to be kept abreast of all the developments perhaps unrealistically given a scoop and the size of this strategy but they need information to fill this void to help heal their trauma at least apply first aid to it you know given that it's so early on and the wounds are wide wide open you have the locals you have local officials who understand that this is it this is zero day there are going to be there is going to be you know a price to pay for this everybody involved given given how many people have died given how huge of the tragedy this is they understand that there is going to be responsibility that people are going to be held accountable and they're trying to protect themselves they're trying to protect themselves perhaps cocooning themselves away not talking to the locals and the stating what is going on that is local officials and you have the central government which has come there Vladimir Putin flew over himself and are trying to now establish order in to give the people the information they want and to account to hold accountable the local officials who are trying to protect themselves you have these three factions and it isn't it isn't nice pleasant to see pleasant to watch as it is now Vladimir Putin was very direct there was no you know there's there's no gentle way of going about this he he said visas criminal negligence he said that this is carelessness this has led to the deaths of so many people corruption bribes for permits this is all part of this is all part of what what causes in fact we have we have a sound bite of Vladimir Putin saying that those responsible will be also briefed about what happened and so far from that brief is where we have a picture of what is going on they said that the fire was the fire began either as a result of an electrical malfunction faulty wiring perhaps a short-circuit as an open fire so it was said it was sent by someone somebody took a lighter or matches to something though that is less likely than the first version an electrical malfunction at that point once the fire took hold everything that could go wrong went wrong we're talking about a fire alarm system that was either broken or was switched off and had been so since the 19th for more than a week and nobody nobody fixed it we know that there was a backup alarm system by which securities at the shopping center had to press a button and people would be warned that something was going on to leave to evacuate nobody press the button for whatever reason nobody pressed it and the first morning people had that something was wrong is when they saw the flames or more likely a huge wall of smoke rushing towards them because this smoke travels very quickly very quickly this very dense and it is like a hammer hitting you in the face there you don't survive for a long time inside inside that smoke it is incredibly taxing on the human organism when you paint that picture of the dark smoke that plumes imagine already being in a dark cinema Oh shows written so easy it adds to the agony of this doesn't it's even worse because the doors pull the doors inside the fire exits as well as the cinema itself the screen rooms with all the people in there children many of them is a cartoon being shown school children where there are a lot of kids exactly from from what we've heard two of the screen rooms well locked the doors were shut usually you have someone sitting at the door they let people in they show their tickets they come in and that person continues to sit there to watch you know make sure that nobody without a ticket goes it what happened in this case is that whoever was on the door they let everyone in that film started they shut the door they lock the door with all those people in there and they left the fire begins the room filling up with smoke everybody's terrified kids start calling their families their parents their fathers their mothers saying please come rescue us help us we're suffocating we're dying and nobody comes nobody comes do love a man stays shut eventually you have kids kids who understand that they're going to die they're calling their mothers for a final farewell they're saying I love you I mean that's that is an absolutely horrific and that is why you have those hundreds of people out in camera right now demanding answers demanding accountability you can you can understand why they're so enraged the other issue is of course many of those kids were left there by their parents and the yeah you know it's nothing unusual in many places in the world people come to a shopping center shopping mall whatever they'll leave their kids were their older siblings but in this case you had so many kids that had been left there and their parents has gone off to do whatever it is that they wanted to do to shop or Toto to work what whatever but now we're in a situation where 64 have officially been declared killed as a result of this fire of the smoke six are still missing officially five people have been arrested that detained being questioned now for their roles for their roles and all in this in this tragedy but we expect we expect there to be more arrests welcome of how high-profile this is lighting me a boutonniere there himself promising that heads will roll that you know just just as an anecdote he said said this earlier he said speaking to relatives speaking to people who had lost loved ones they tell you things that make you want to cry then absolutely devastating to hear then he says I'm talking to you to officials and you tell it in an entirely different way you paint an entirely different picture presumably trying to cover their hides to protect themselves from from the fallout so we expect there to be further developments further developments high-profile developments more arrests as as this investigation continues and we must wait it is it isn't nice to hear but we mice must wait we must wait for investigators to sift through the wreckage to find everything they need and to establish culpability you earlier give us a sense of the a very human side of what occurred here with with some of the children giving an example of the spiritual and their teacher coming into this city maybe a trip art that had been planning for weeks let's now take a look at murat package earlier which he put together on the stories of some of the people affected for rural youngsters visit to the big city is always an adventure these 12 year old classmates went to town and they went bowling ice skating to the cinema it would be the last adventure silifulin school I do not forgive the repetition this class natira three annular particular dozens and dozens dead but they aren't just numbers they all had names lives all the compensation and the world won't cover their family's loss especially given that so many of the victims were children Masha was there with her grandmother she only turned ten last week and posted this photo online exactly a decade is all she got in this world both she and her grandmother perished Tatyana an English teacher she was there with her daughter who survived the Tianna got her out of the building before hearing that others were still trapped she went to help rescue who she could strangers but she never came back out you were the best teacher in the world writer former students you didn't deserve this we will all remember you little rat above pictured here with his mum and dad she wasn't with them but imagine her pain when she had to identify the bodies of her child and husband not even surviving is easy some say he jumped others that his father threw him out of the window in a desperate effort to save his little boy before succumbing for the smoke himself we won't know until sergei wakes up from his coma alone his parents and little sister there are too many to mention here but the point is made a list of names is one thing but it's only when you get to know them just a little that the depth of this tragedy really hits you okay Igor Jayden off now joins us live on the program again from camera four Igor one of the frustrations that we're hearing from people on the streets there is that they want their loved ones back they want their bodies that to mourn of course in a lot of cases that's difficult to do because rescuers are still sifting through the remains as gruesome as terrible as that signs and you've been talking you've been speaking to people who actually have seen the morgue the situation as it stands there is that correct yes Union this is very correct well before we get to that I should say that the city is hurt and it is hurt badly hence so many people have decided to show up to gather for this piratical II organized meeting on a workday really with getting reports that and it looks like thousands of people have shown up and those who couldn't because they had worked they had errands to run they drive by they roll down their windows they're honking they're yelling in support of those who have come here and what people want well they want answers first and foremost and there's a spirit here everyone we've been talking to from taxi drivers to bystanders to those who lay flowers at the vigil they believe that the the local authorities could be lowering down the actual number of those who died in the inferno on Sunday the official number stands at 64 but here people believe that as many as 300 people may have died but the authorities are trying to hush it down so to speak now right now I can I we I have one of the one of those members one of the people who decided to show up to this meeting today with me Ilona Lenin and we can talk to her and gather her reaction to what's going on Ilona stop reading stop bujji LaVon shame about your motors working day why did you decide to come why are you here I was motivated by the fact that I didn't want to stay at home reading the comments I couldn't I couldn't do that I wanted to go and to do something to do to help not just monitor as through the media not to disseminate any rumors we had the information that people gathering here is it a demonstration or not I don't know I don't care about didn't the way anyone calls it but we are here to get answers the real answers that's what we want he said that you were to the mark all the gossips about the toll rising as high 300 or 500 at some say - you were at the mall what can you say about all these rumors I was at one of the morgues located at valle de Grasse 37 building number 37 told that mark has 67 bodies 64 of them are from the same Novation mall three people they they have nothing to do with that tragedy 64 people are currently there that mark this one Marquez 64 people that's what I can say many of them were children so why the room was done like this figures 300 people more you have seen the official lists of people diseased and we had one of the officials saying that those who still cannot find their relatives should step four to take a step forward should come up and say that we have a very small city indeed everyone has some friends relatives acquaintances some work at the hospital some have access to various other lists alleged other least nine and the information has been spread around by the emergency services personnel some of them say 64 is not real 300 is the real figure so you see people just passed that around the mouth-to-mouth mass media come up with screenshots of messages people write to their families 64 is not the real figure 350 is at all we have I 450 that's all in the internet being disseminated circulated very very actively we understand that many videos are fake they're not from here they're being disseminated just with claims but they have to do with this fire that blaze some try to fly this up some write nasty comments I couldn't bear it any longer I decided to come here personally to see what is happening what in front of the city municipal hall we have stage with the microphone on it everyone can have up and say did you try to come up and say what you think we've been to the morgue and one more place and we are here just for that the mayor wanted to take people just ordinary people form a group and drive the group to one of the malls and up in hospitals and everything some people heard us some nods people started to say that we were bribed we were whatever I hope that my words rooted in see some of the people but those who I'm communicating I'm trying to reach out to them explain them that that's the that's a real figure but it's happening in fact I don't know I don't know where what is happening right now thank you for giving your comments thank you for your time well so you this this this thing about 300 people about local authorities potentially lowering down the number of people are perished in the inferno is not the only thing that's driven all of these people here they also want answers as to how this tragedy was even possible in the first place because the fire they are asking questions like why wasn't there a fire alarm why did people had to learn about the about the starting blaze by the smell of the smoke or why did security guards actually had to alert them why were there no sprinklers and how come and how come that fire escapes the very paths that were supposed to lead people to safety were blocked were locked and people had to break down doors that people had to actually jump out of the windows trying to save their lives they won't quit they want answers to all of these questions and they are saying that very often for people for survivors it was difficult in inside because security guards in the representatives of officials there weren't really helping have a listen I ran upstairs cinema stuff didn't let me through they pushed me my daughter asked me why no one was saving her her asked the fireman to do something but he just stared at me I ran to the third floor firemen stood there do nothing in front of the door my daughter told me that she loved me and that she was suffocating I told her to get down on the floor and begged her not to die the children are there it isn't a matter of how many are dead now unless we change something hundreds of others could die no matter how long was ten here no matter how loud we shout no one will hear us Vladimir Putin landed here on camera the early morning he laid flowers to the vigil and he spoke to some of the citizens to comfort them in the moment of their loss he called what happened in the shopping mall on Sunday a result of criminal negligence he said that this wasn't a war zone people suppose to die in this place it was supposed to be a place specifically designed to lead people quickly away if any emergency should arise and clearly that was not the case so he promised justice he promised that everyone responsible will be punished as they deserve and the Russian Investigative Committee is looking into the tragedy on its side they have detained five people in connection with this no charges have been pressed yet but they are questioning five people including the owner of the shopping mall and the fire safety chief there have also detained one of the security guards because they believe it was him who disabled who actually shut down the fire prevention system and that was the reason why it didn't work now we're here standing by in camera but to bring you all the latest from this gathering to gauge reaction and to get the atmosphere as well as follow the investigation of course eager to down off live from camera at giving us really just a good example of what is happening there are a lot
