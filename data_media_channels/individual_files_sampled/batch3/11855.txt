hello welcome to Sophie EMCO I'm Sophie Shepard not say Serbia cherishes its political neutrality trying to stay away from global confrontations but how will that play out with Serbia's aspirations for you membership well I'm in bull great today to talk about all of this with Servius Foreign Minister he beat Sebastian Serbia is firmly on course to join the European Union just two decades after being a pariah state bombed by the West yet the legacy of war during the 90s is putting a roadblock in belgrade's path and the unresolved question of Kosovo could stop its accession what is Serbia prepared to do to secure EU membership what happens if it's forced to choose between old alliances and new ones and at what point during negotiations will Belgrade finally draw the line for mr. Dutch it's really great to have you on our program one more time it's been a couple of years already lots to talk about so president wood church wants to join the European Union but he also says that there's no way he will allow Serbian Russia relations to go sour now you know you and Russia relations right now are not at its best and we don't know when they will get better so seeing how all the other EU members fall in line regarding sanctions against Russia why do you think that you will be able to defy Brussels when the time comes we live at a time of anti-russia hysteria in the world so when I was in the White House and talked to the National Security Advisor McMaster he literally said that the American influence is good and the Russian influence is harmful in case of Serbia it did not prove to be true in the past seeing how over the past few decades many principles of the international law have been violated in the example of Serbia first of all the borders of Serbia have been changed by recognition of the unilaterally declared independence of Kosovo Serbia belongs to Europe geographically politically and historically and it's only logical there are interests becoming the member of the European Union is based on I would say our personal experience now I held different positions in government as Prime Minister and as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and I have never heard anyone from the Russian side speaking negatively of our wish to join the European Union the only thing that Russia expects is that it will not result in an anti Russian position which Serbia is not at all interested in doing but one of the conditions is to harmonize our foreign policy with that of the European Union and that is where Russia comes in joining the sanctions against the Russian Federation you know there are some countries which pose this question at every meeting you probably know which countries I am referring to they always criticize Serbia for not joining the sanctions against the Russian Federation but we're surely not going to join the sanctions and in that sense we shall continue to develop good relations with the Russian Federation where mr. Lavrov has awarded you with an order of friendship which is a very high wart from the Russian government in this piece that you call authored with Lavrov you have denounced the either with us or against us approach to the Serbian foreign policy but the way people see it is that if you're not part of any camp then you're not anyone's friend really I mean it is not our position that were not on anyone's side we would like to be members of the European Union but on the other hand we have good bilateral relations with the Russian Federation and we have no intention to lead those relations just to become a European Union member on the other hand all those who love Serbia have to take care of our national interests as well pursuing anti-russian policies would be to our detriment so we're not sitting on two chairs we have our own chair because that's exactly what a representative of the State Department who it Brian Yi said you can't be sitting on it two chairs you got to choose do you feel like America could pressure you at some point paulownia well he resigned so I don't really have a response to his claims I'm more into the view that Serbia should seek common ground with the Western interests in a sense that they should take an impartial stance and Ward's us we have had good relations with the United States and the UK we were allies in wars but during the crisis of the 1990s they practically diverted a lot from us which resulted in their airstrikes against us and then there was the separation storm in Croatia as well not to mention the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo so in that sense it is necessary for the Western countries to understand that there will be no peace in the region without searching for a common solution without searching for something that is acceptable to all and speaking about the relations between Russia and the United States we hope that there will be some sort of a warm-up in these relations I was chairman of the OSCE in 2015 it was the 40th anniversary of the OSCE I read a statement then written in 1975 by then president of Yugoslavia in the statement that was read in Helsinki with a little adjustment for the times that's exactly the statement that I could have made today he was calling for they don't alleviation of tension between the blocks even Henry Kissinger recently said that he hoped there would be some warm-up in the relations between the United States and the Russian Federation because the next phase we don't one like this would be war and no one should be stupid enough to enter a war that would lead to total destruction before me so you know the best way to have a to taunt right now between America and Russia is to find common ground for something and I know that Lavrov has said that Russia and the United States could become part of Kosovo Serbia negotiations do you think an international mediation could help here we have never heard from the United States that they would like to take part in those negotiations that's what the Albanians from Kosovo are saying they are actually seeking the involvement of the United States in addition to the european union's in a moment on the other hand we have to keep in mind that those proposals are put forward we have to acknowledge them and in that case we would like to invite the Russian Federation to join as well in the talks that president voltage had with President Putin and with foreign minister Lavrov and myself Russia has expressed readiness to join the process but actually we don't feel it is necessary to expand this story right now I know that president buchiach' supports dialogue with Kosovo but in dowse he said that there's no way service going to recognize Kosovo independence unless it gets something in return what kind of concessions are you looking here for it's been 10 years after the unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo and it's a still an experiment regardless of the fact that Kosovo has been recognized by some states Kosovo hasn't completed its independence run it has not become a UN member and member of other organizations there are a lot of countries that do not recognize it like Russia China India Indonesia Iran Iraq Brazil Argentina Mexico Ethiopia South Africa Spain 5 EU members haven't recognized Kosovo also over the past few months we've managed to have some of the countries revoke their recognition it means that the process is still alive it's not over yet no one can have a secession without an agreement with the country from which they wish to secede in that sense but for dialogue some European countries say that Serbia has to so that Serbia must recognize Kosovo's independence but that's not a compromise Serbia will never recognize the unilaterally declared independence of Kosovo when the countries which advise us to do so when they do that themselves there are some other standards because from the tone of president rule chiche people gathered that maybe there's a chance that there could be a compromise for instance I know that the Serbs that have been living in the north of Kosovo they've enjoyed the factor in the pendens they've always been supported by both great now but great wants them to integrate with the Kosovars why if what if I don't know for instance as an option serbian exist in northern part of kosovo populated where they Serbs and maybe recognize this cost of our independence could that be a working compromise me we have our own proposals on how the compromise could look like the Albanians and Christina don't consider it necessary to even enter a compromise they don't want to discuss they just want to discuss that Belgrade should recognize their independence and that is unacceptable for us we can have discussions and all other issues we have an internal dialogue on how to arrange two relations but Albanians obviously think it's enough to have recognition from some Western countries and that would make it a fait accompli they're wrong here they have a false list of countries that have recognized them they speak of 116 countries that recognize them and I'm sure it's in the interests of all to actually find a compromise but if they don't want to compromise we shall continue our struggle what is the Serbian compromise look like I mean first for opinions to engage with you in a dialogue to be ready for a compromise and then what what is your proposal of a compromise what would it be it's not an immediate it should be discussed I mean with due respects all I wouldn't like to engage in less publicly we could discuss these several times but I mean I gave my own proposals and we didn't come to a point that they would actually listen to our proposal maybe they'll hear usefully media you see right now oh you're planning it would be easier if I had to negotiate with you but you know they won't listen to us at all they just say we're independent and you have to recognize us and that's all for mister we're going to take a short break right now when we're back we'll continue talking to service foreign ministry visa - each we're talking about Serbia Russian relations and we'll talk more about service prospects of joining the European Union stay with us and we're back with service for a minister so that's huge foreign minister you keep bringing up the fact that some countries have recognized Kosovo others haven't I mean lately Barbados said yes cause always independent then Suriname has revoked I mean do these things really matter I mean we are looking at it from the outside we can't figure out does this really change anything in a Kosovo serbian issue countries recognizing revoking there is a huge difference between explanations given by the countries that recognize Kosovo and those that are actually revoking their recognition some say that they have general legal principles but essentially it's not correct from the point of view of the international law it's absolutely unacceptable the Albanians in Kosovo are not a nation they are an Iranian national minority because the Albanian people have their own state that's Albania is there any other nation that has two states and they say that they need one president now they're just speaking their mind they're saying what they're also thinking for them the purpose is greater Albania regardless of who will suffer the consequences and regardless of who is to be blamed but that is their goal unification of all Albanians would you been against it so say no one in this one he can create Albania if they want so but on the territory of other states surely not in our territory we want dialogue we want dialogue to be successful we want to reach a solution that is in the interest of all but imposing a solution that we have to recognize Kosovo giving ultimatums that is something that does not work with the Serbian people somebody in the international community may be interpreting our wish to have a dialogue as a weakness maybe footage should also say that the Republika Srpska in Bosnia should also have one president with Serbia maybe they would have respected us more if we said that we we're suppressing the wish of the Republic Srpska to unify with serbia because we respect the provisions of the Dayton Agreement nevertheless were often criticized by the Western countries Rama and other Albanian politicians are viewed as good guys but there is one problem I showed the map shows all the terrorists coming from Bosnia and Herzegovina I showed it to Rex Tillerson all the terrorists have fought in Kosovo and in Bosnia as Islamist fundamentalists so they're not gonna go after us now instead they're going to turn their guns and kill them now and if the West doesn't understand that it may be too late so foreign minister from this talk I understand that neither serbian government nor serbian people are willing to recognize Kosovo's independence compromise is something very vague because opinions as you say aren't listening but that is the main stumbling point of your accession to the European Union I mean I know that the German Foreign Minister has said that Serbia will have to recognize cost of what 20 you how do you go from here Serbia and Uwe Slavia in the past welcomed the reunification of Germany and it is not appropriate for foreign minister Gabriel to make a statement like that well he also said that he didn't really say that and if he didn't then I apologize to him you does not have a common position of Kosovo they criticize us for not accepting the common European foreign policy on Russia so why don't they figure out a common foreign policy regarding Kosovo these are positions stated by those who recognize it is my opinion that there is no price for serbian recognition of kosovo if anyone thinks that for the sake of joining the European Union Serbia would recognize Kosovo under the conditions that they impose right now and not on the basis of dialogue and compromise they're very wrong wants a compromise but the solution proposed by kosovo albanians is not a real solution I understand your arguments and they're very logical but the matter of the fact is they demand this of you maybe not the German Foreign Minister himself but the EU in general that's one of the demands that you'd have to recognize the independence what's more important for Serbia their session to the EU by 2025 or recognizing the independence let me repeat once again no one has officially said this to us the European Union cannot really stand by a position like that when it has five members that do not even recognize Kosovo we cannot expect Spain to be more Serbian oriented than the Serbs themselves no one can demand those things of Serbia it's humiliating Serbia seeks good relations when it joins the European Union but what they're telling us they should be telling Pristina as well they should tell them that there is no European perspective no path to Europe unless you reach an agreement with felt great they tell us that there is no such perspective they should tell this to the other side as well say that there will be no European path for them unless they reach a compromise and so we'll see if there are really double standards in their behavior well I know the answer I can tell you this immediately right now yes there are double standards but we're not gonna fall for that this is my opinion maybe there will be some other government in Serbia that will accept it but I think this is not going to happen in our generations but look what's happening from the other side he wants to see Kosovo as part of the Union cause the worse wants to join European Union Howard Serbia feel about that if Kosovo gotta you membership Kosovo cannot become a member of the European Union let me point out that you should be reading carefully what the documents of the European Union say they do have an agreement of association with Kosovo but that's if you could say so it's a mini agreement they agreed with the cost of or not as a state but as a territory with a special way of marking it exactly for the reason that there are five members that have not recognized Kosovo yet this agreement hasn't been ratified by all countries was recognized by the European Parliament should be very clear on that if there is no agreement in the Union if we don't reach a compromise it is very difficult for Kosovo to become part of the European Union and they should be told so someone should be telling them that in this sense some feel that this case was finished in 2008 no well it has not been finished if that was the case why would they be pressuring us now why is it that important for them what we have to say obviously this affair is not over yet okay let's pretend that the Kosovo issue is not a Kosovo issue for Serbia to become part of the you let's just talk about the EU criterias that have been put forward in order for Serbia to join the union I know that lucic said they're so harsh that it's almost like climbing of Everest could it be European plan to actually make it so hard for Serbia to enter the EU that you want enter when he has said that bit about the Himalayas he was referring to Kosovo and the fact is that the European Union regardless of a lack of a unified position well probably most of its members would like Serbia to recognize Kosovo well we are for a compromise and the Albanians do not want to discuss it at all that is why it's difficult it's difficult because only one side is exposed to pressure in that sense which said that there were great obstacles before us but that has been known to happen to someone talk limes to Himalayas and Mount Everest that goes for him alive but I'm talking more about the criterias for the West Balkan countries to join the EU more like financial economic criteria that also have been put forward and dubbed very tough why are they so tough because last time when you previously offered Western Balkans to become part of the Union only one state Croatia became mean like what 2003 none of other Western Balkan states frankly speaking joining the European Union is a complex process and it implies progress and reforms to be made in all segments there's 35 chapters to cover but as far as Serbia is concerned I have to be very frank I don't think they're really interested in how much progress Serbia has made they're more interested in how much progress was made regarding Kosovo so even the dialogue was burdened with political connotations and that's what really bothers us the only thing that they're going to consider is whether or not we're going to accept some sort of concessions in dialogue with Pristina yeah because the EU strategy also says that none of the Western Balkan states can be considered as a functioning market economy I mean Serbia has just completed a three-year IMF program with flying colors you actually the economic results exceeded all expectations if you're not a market economy then what are you there were some proposals to form a joint market in the Balkan region but many in our region are allergic to proposals aimed at unity because that reminds them of former Yugoslavia for example Kosovo Montenegro and some other states were not willing to accept any proposals like that because they see them as something where Serbia will be dominant because Serbia by size is bigger than many others combined together will be as if someone in the European Union says we don't want a common European market because Germany would be dominant there so there are many obstacles that are not related to Kosovo here we should be working on those of course strengthening bilateral relations searching for resolutions of disputes between the former Yugoslavian countries and of course encouraging economic development and then there is also the Serbian people and how they feel about entering the you for instance I have a survey from original corporation council which says 70% of Serbs believe that the country will be part of the Year by 2025 and 33 say Serbia will probably never even join you know there's this joke that I read what's the difference between optimist and the pessimist and optimist thinks that it's actually by 2025 Albania when will answer you when Serbia is a use president and then the pessimists think that Serbia will enter the U and Albania say you're present so why is there such discrepancy between what the government wants and what the people want I think it's a reaction to permanence which of the terms both an internal and external politics when you talk about internal affairs different politicians give promises usually on the eve of the elections and then nothing happens on the other hand the European Union often gave so to speak moving targets they tell you to do something and then they tell you to do something else the way the EU citizens are tired of enlargement the same way the citizens in Western Balkans are tired of reforms in that sense perhaps it's realistic for Serbia and Montenegro to become EU members in 2025 if we conclude negotiations but other countries are not in that package perhaps not all of them will enter at the same time they call it the regards of principle I have one last question about China if you don't mind my name that China has been heavily investing in Serbia for the last couple of years and that makes the European Union worried I think maybe that's why when they put forward a plan for the but West Balkan states to become part of a Ewing 2025 but would you be willing to give up all those Chinese contracts for your EU membership because they don't conform you norms and standards some countries in the European Union are jealous and opposed to the strengthening of our economic cooperation with China or Russia for that matter but that does not mean that the same is true when they are involved with China look at it Angela Merkel goes to China and brings along business people and then signs a lot of contracts in China America north and central Europeans agreed to the Russia project North stream - that's okay when they do it and when we want to do the South Stream gas pipe then it's not okay we are not going to violate any standards any principles regarding regulating the economic deals but with China and Russia we are strategic partners we have agreements we have such agreements with France as well we shall surely continue that cooperation so far Russia is a bigger investor than China and we like that welcomed that we are happy as we are happy to welcome any other country which isn't coming to us by a military airplane for me sir thank you very much for this interview all the best of luck with everything and hope we'll see you soon thank you you
