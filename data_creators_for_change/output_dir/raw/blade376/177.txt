00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone how's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it going I've been</font>

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,759
debating for quite some time<font color="#CCCCCC"> now what</font>

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,140
sort of video I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be putting up</font>

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,110
next got a few concepts for a few

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,710
serious videos and I felt the need to do

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,780
a funny one first but it just wasn't

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,580
happening I am working a new job now as

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,769
many of you perhaps know you all ready

9
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,599
for the BBC for their comedy department

10
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,019
it is a dream<font color="#E5E5E5"> come true and it's a</font>

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,059
privilege to be working with a team of

12
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,090
great people and it's been really really

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,210
good fun if you want to see the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,160
stuff I've been working on then there is

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">a link of their channel if you click it</font>

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,530
you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and comment and whenever</font>

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,690
you do comment on a video or on the

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,750
channel and the likelihood<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that I</font>

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,590
will see it her so yeah but on a general

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,730
night like um I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been through another</font>

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,729
