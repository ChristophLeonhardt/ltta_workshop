00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:06,210
When it comes to
swimming in sand,

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,910
you can’t be too skinny
or too smooth.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,090
That’s the lesson that
scientists at Georgia Tech

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,070
and Harvard have
learned from watching

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,710
this shovel-nosed snake.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,900
They had done earlier
studies of a lizard called

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,240
a sandfish.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,740
And those studies suggested
that long and thin

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,050
was probably the best shape
for this kind of movement.

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,360
High-speed X-ray movies of
the snake proved them right.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,490
But the reason is not
what you might think.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,340
It’s not just that the
snake is streamlined.

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,500
It turns out that
the long, thin body

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,870
of a snake with
lots of vertebrae

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,520
makes it much
easier to achieve

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,740
the complicated twists and turns
that make this movement work.

18
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,870
But the theory predicted
that, for the snake’s movement

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,990
to work, its skin had to be
smoother than the lizard’s

20
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,900
to cut down on friction.

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,090
Tests proved that
prediction right, too.

22
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,550
So why didn’t the
sandfish evolve

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,080
to be longer and thinner?

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,850
Well, it has other
demands in life,

25
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,239
like running on
top of the sand.

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,710
But the shovel-nosed snake
spends more time

27
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,510
under the surface of the sand.

28
00:01:09,510 --> 00:00:00,000
And that life has made it one
slick, slender specialist.
