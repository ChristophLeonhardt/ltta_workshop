new evidence that Donald Trump's hellish month is taking a toll on his standing and that's sending many Republicans into a panic about the midterms so what we're about to report to you right now is something you kind of already know Donald Trump's one of the least popular presidents ever along with something that is actually really underappreciated by the political and media class the Donald Trump's problems with governing and his aides crimes are now weighing down his presidency so while it's become sort of fashionable in political circles to say things like Trump is Teflon or his base never wavers in a new poll tonight his approval has fallen to 36% a drop a 6% in this new CNN poll and a full sixty-one percent of Americans view him unfavorably and it gets worse with those who strongly disapprove of Trump at 48% those are the kinds of voters who are likely to turn out against Trump in November independence also giving up on Trump you can see it in this chart they were all the way up at 47% just last month and what you're looking at is a key data point slide a huge shift to 31% that actually marks get this an all-time low for Trump among independents tonight it has now been three weeks since Trump's campaign manager was convicted and his top fixer pled guilty to committing crimes to help elect him plus of course the separate indictments of his congressional endorsers and the Bob Woodward reporting that has rocked this White House with serious evidence of incompetence and high-level revolt plus of course in these last three weeks we also had the dramatic anonymous declaration of resistance by one of trumps own senior aides so all of this stuff is happening and we in the news cover it for you and people say okay what next well tonight is what's next the collective response in the country has people pulling further away from Donald Trump you can see it in the gradual softening in this survey from multiple polls this is from the polling experts over at 538 Trump needs approval in roughly the 40s for the GOP to have a realistic chance of holding the house according to experts and we that because of the data in elections since 1946 any decline and a president's approval hurts their party a little bit less than it hurts them but hurts so as Trump drops five to six points that can cost Republicans two points in the house and with Trump at 36% tonight well where does that put him against his worst times we're gonna leave it up on the screen for you here you can see as compared to firing Comey which was very controversial or compared to when he had that widely panned summit with Putin which many conservatives criticized or charlottesville what you see currently on the far left the 36 percent tonight is a near record low right on par with where he was after Charlottesville and his Donald Trump plummets and the walls close in today his own son concedes Trump has a circle of trust that is much smaller than they want I think there are people in there that he can trust it's just it's a much smaller group than I would like it to be who do you trust well I you know I'll keep that to myself and they're not family well obviously if I'm talking outside a family I think that one goes without saying a much smaller group than they would like that's a statement about who Donald Trump trusts and if you think about it it gets the whole concept backwards we live in a democracy you may not feel like that on certain days but we do and that means the important question is who the voters trust and although the white house might be making all kinds of noise to distract you from this information on your screen the fact is voters do not trust or approve of Trump tonight overall 61 percent view him unfavorably and among independents you see it down to 31 percent which is a record-breaking low now Donald Trump started his presidency with a resistance that was literally larger than his base because he lost the popular vote tonight we can report after everything that's happened that resistance is growing I'm joined now by former Maryland congresswoman Donna Edwards a political pollster Cornell Belcher and Democratic strategist Julianne Epstein Julianne when you look at these numbers sometimes we have to focus on the facts right in front of our face does it show that people are listening I even those who as I mentioned with independence last month were up in the 40s are dropping in response to what they've learned just in the last three weeks I think the obvious answer to that question is yes August was kind of a scorched month a scorched earth month for this White House I don't think any White House has ever had an August that was as bad as the last as the last month was safe for maybe August of 1973 in the Nixon White House I the numbers are going down not just with independence but with college-educated women with non college educated white men so this is you know this is a situation that is just getting worse and worse what's most remarkable to me about this White House is not just that they've boxed themselves in and so many different situations with so many different scandals is that they just have no idea how to kind of get themselves out of the mess that they're in I mean it with it with every incident that we've seen whether it's the Cohen plea or the Woodward book or the New York Times op-ed they continue to make these matters worse they continue to call more attention to it than they need to it's just it's like the guys in the White House or somewhere and the President himself or somewhere like a cross between mr. magoo and a Bond villain everything they do in responding to these you know incessant crises that seem to happen on a daily basis just makes things worse and worse and it's all showing up in the polling numbers the worst thing I think for the president's the personal qualities the qualities of trust honesty strength intelligence all of those numbers are very very much down in the lasing latest polls and the reason that that's bad Ari is because those numbers are harder to move than the phone numbers on policy questions Donna well look you can't get elected if people don't like you and they don't trust you and I think that's the problem that Republicans are facing right now the president's numbers I think are pretty baked in but I don't think he's bottomed out yet I mean he may retain that 30 plus percent core but you know Democrats know that in district after district across the country that Trump has lost independence those are the voters who have to be won over in order to win those districts there are what 23 or so districts where Hillary Clinton won and they're up for grabs and so I think that what we're gonna see here is that Trump's numbers will continue to drag Republicans down and they're running out of time I mean there's not really time to do anything else about that and I think that Republicans certainly in on Capitol Hill but around the country are beginning to realize that Cornell as a pollster you operate in an environment where a lot of people had the aftershocks of 2016 and are skeptical of all polls in fact the bulk of national polls showed Hillary in the lead and nationally she finished in the lead but lost the electoral college so while it was a shock wave and I think the media made a lot of mistakes in 2016 and it will own up to there has been a kind of an overreaction and even a fear to look at these numbers I mean I think there might be viewers Cornell right now who say wait if it's really this bad how and I haven't heard about this well partly there's a lot of different stories but how do you as an expert look at these numbers and the significance they tell you going into the midterms a couple things one is around the 25 2016 there wasn't it is that the defending all right I don't think the polling wasn't a problem I think the problem was an arrogant we always wanted to be a force to weigh race and a force to a race Hillary did get closer to a majority of support but it was never a two-way to a race it was always a a four-person support person race because independents if they're a party it's sort of the protest vote was bigger this time around than it has been before so I think I narrative was wrong and in 2012 the sort of public polling was was was was right on part of the problem in polling is getting the universe right right so it is who is a likely voter and what's really important I think for Democrats this time around you know and I want to sort of caution us about this I don't care how low the troubles are job approval numbers drop if if we have the 2010 or the 2014 electorate again Democrats are not going to take back the house right if we have an electorate that is that that looks a lot younger and a lot more diverse than midterm elections typically do I think Democrats have have a fighting chance if you have an electorate that is that is that is that is that is more upscale and one of the things that I think it's really important in those numbers is is even a majority of white voters are now you're supposing of Trump and 55% of college whites are stronger this in disapproval of Trump so it is not only just as disapproval numbers but can Democrats generate enthusiasm among voters who are not typical midterm election voters to turn out and drove this time around and that's where you get the polling you know not exactly right because the universes aren't exactly right so I want you all to stay with me I want to dig into this discussion of the leadership of Donald Trump along with the concerns about it you have of course a hurricane heading towards the East Coast right now a new concern about the presence of environmental policy which is also important now take a look Trump late today claimed that his own response to the crisis in Puerto Rico he said was positive of course that hurricane Maria left almost 3,000 Americans dead I think the Puerto Rico was an incredible unsung success Texas we have been given a pluses for Florida we've been given a pluses for I think in a certain way the best job we did was Puerto Rico and while Trump is saying that in public I want to report the New York Times had a big piece noting a private secret plan here to effectively dilute Obama restrictions on a key gas methane which can drive global warming and this comes while the UN secretary-general is calling on world leaders to do the opposite to take the threat of climate change more seriously climate change is the defining issue of our time and we are at a defining moment the leaders of the world need to step up Julian I wonder if you could put it that in context for us what The Times is unearthed what's going on in the administrative state sort of behind the scenes as we brace for this hurricane well Trump saying that the Houston experience and the and the Puerto Rico experience for the Hurricanes last year is the Baghdad Bob moment Baghdad Bob of course being the Iraqi general who claimed during the American invasion in 2003 that the Americans were committing suicide and surrendering this is the Baghdad moment and when we talk about the self-inflicted wounds this is Trump again kind of playing to the thirty percent of his voters many of them kind of very the thirty percent of the public of war has based many of them being very low information but the rest of the two-thirds of the country saying this guy is a little bit of a buffoon so again this is to the point about self-inflicted wounds and the notion that he would say that on on September 11th when we commemorate 9/11 and in Puerto Rico remember we lost almost 3,000 Americans the fact that he would not comprehend that on such a sacred and hallowed day is just insult to injury the notion then on the methane issue and these things tie together quite nicely the notion that you would be making the the climate change problem worse by loosening the rules on methane gas and that's a major contributor to climate change while the biggest hurricane in 30 years is getting ready to barrel down right on the East Coast again just tells you how completely out to lunch the White House staff and the president are on just like basic fundamental like no-brainer Communications issues well you say that and Donna that ties in to what Donald Trump does think of his supporters the infamous 5th Avenue Line of course is an insult to supporters because who would want to be a member of a club that was so cultish it would support murder on Fifth Avenue but take a look I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters okay it's like incredible but Donna the the independence chart that were putting up in the context of all these woes says the opposite those were people who were more with him and they've looked at the last three weeks and they've turned well and you know maybe Trump was right about 36% of Americans but here's the thing with the 2975 people Americans died in in Puerto Rico because of the president's neglect and incompetence and I think what they see and the president is his inability to take responsibility and and make changes to say I was wrong and we should do things differently and his total lack of empathy for you know for people who are suffering and so you know I look at that and then I see these these methane gas rules changes and of course that's one in a line of changes around environmental policy that completely undo Obama era policies but he's given licence really to his agencies to the EPA to undo all of these regulations and so you know what that 31 percent of independency right now is you know what you know they're traveling in a very small minority with a president who has another very small minority of Americans who are with him and Cornel pardon another obvious question but sometimes it is part of my job what does it tell you that they weren't shouting this new methane climate change policy from the rooftops that they are trying to sneak it I'm gonna let a big political secret out of the bag here Ari it is if you want to be popular you probably should do things that are popular right you know rolling back is that why they made you the big bucks polar company but you know if you won do cliff will be popular you got through things the popular and this administration his behavior aside what have they been working on over the last two years rolling back ACA there's not a majority mandate for rolling back kc8 you know trying to destroy a health care that's not that's not popular giving a big tax cut to really rich people that's not a popular thing if you want to be popular you probably should do things that the majority of Americans actually want you to do hey I'm already Melvin from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our youtube channel below you could have been
