MIKE POMPEO, THE HEAD OF THE CIA AND TRUMP'S NOMINEE TO BE HIS SECRETARY OF STATE, HAS APPARENTLY VISITED NORTH KOREA AND SPOKEN TO OFFICIALS THERE. NOW, IT'S UNCLEAR IF THERE IS ANY REAL RESULT FROM THAT MEETING, BUT TRUMP OF COURSE IS BRAGGING ABOUT IT, AND IN THE MIDDLE OF DOING SO TWEETED SOMETHING THAT WAS INACCURATE. SO LET'S READ HIS TWEET AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS INACCURATE OKAY. SO THE PART OF THAT TWEET THAT WAS NOT CORRECT HAD TO DO WITH THE TIMING PEOPLE ARE GIVING HIM A HARD TIME ABOUT THAT MISTAKE, BUT I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, WHEN YOU LOOK AT TRUMP AS A WHOLE AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS HE HAS TWEETED IN THE PAST, THIS IS A SMALL ERROR. IT'S UNSURPRISING THAT HE HAD NO IDEA WHEN THE MEETING HAPPENED, HE DOESN'T DO HIS HOMEWORK, ETC., BUT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THAT. ASS, IN TRUMP WORLD THIS IS A TINY AIR COMPARED TO THE GIGANTIC MISTAKES HE NORMALLY MAKES, INCLUDING IN THIS CASE TO ME THE MUCH MORE INTERESTING PART WAS HIM BLURTING OUT THAT WE ARE HAVING VERY HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS. THAT WAS THE PART I WAS ABOUT TO GET TO, REPORTERS WERE TRYING TO DIG AROUND AND ASK ABOUT THIS MEETING BECAUSE YESTERDAY TRUMP HAD BRAGGED ABOUT HOW THERE ARE MEETINGS HAPPENING WITH NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS AT VERY HIGH LEVELS, AND SO OF COURSE THAT'S VAGUE AND PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, AND WHEN REPORTERS WERE ASKED THEY WERE BASIC WE TOLD, HMM, WE DON'T DISCUSS THE CIA AND THE DIRECTOR'S TRAVEL. AND THEN TRUMP TWEETS THIS TODAY AND ESSENTIALLY GOES AGAINST WHAT OTHER WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS HAD TOLD THE MEDIA. SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION, AGAIN YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF TRUMP GOING BACK AND FORTH ON CERTAIN THINGS, THE WHITE HOUSE GOING BACK AND FORTH ON CERTAIN THINGS. THE GUY IS SUCH A CHILD. YOU KNOW, I GROW TIRED OF SAYING IT, BUT YOU CAN'T NORMALIZE HOW STUPID HE IS. SO ALL THE ADULTS GO, OKAY AND BY THE WAY, ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS, IN TERMS OF NORTH KOREA NEGOTIATIONS WITH SOUTH KOREA, I LOVE IT. I'M NOT AGAINST TRUMP' IS POLICY, SUCH AS IT IS, FOR TODAY. OKAY? BUT YOU HAVE TO CALL IT LIKE IT IS. SO TRUMP ALL THE ADULTS GO HEY, NOW THIS IS DELICATE, WE WANT TO EXECUTE THIS POLICY IN A CORRECT WAY SO WE CAN ACTUALLY GET TO PEACE, SO PLEASE DON'T TELL PEOPLE THAT THE HEAD OF OUR CIA AND THE GUY YOU NOMINATED TO BE OUR SECRETARY OF STATE IS GOING AND HAS PERSONALLY MET WITH KIM JONG-UN. HE'S LIKE, GOT IT, NOT TALKING ABOUT IT. THEN HE GOES IN FRONT OF THE PRESS, YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT I KNOW. OH, JESUS CHRIST. IT'S VERY HIGH LEVEL, I CAN'T TELL YOU, BUT VERY HIGH-LEVEL. WHAT DID YOU THINK PEOPLE WERE GOING TO DO? THEY ARE GOING TO ASK, WHAT HIGH LEVEL? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? AND THE NEXT MORNING, HIS OWN WHITE HOUSE PUTS OUT STATEMENTS NO, NO, THESE RUMORS ARE NOT EXACTLY RIGHT, AND BLAH BLAH, IN THE NEXT MORNING HE'S LIKE I'VE GOT A GREAT IDEA, I WILL DO A TWEET, MIKE POMPEO MET WITH KIM JONG-UN. EVEN WHEN HE'S RIGHT HE FINDS A WAY TO SCREW IT UP SO ROYALLY. YES, AND EVEN WHEN HE'S RIGHT DON'T GET EXCITED BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE'S GOING TO REMAIN ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ISSUE. NOW, LOOK, I AM HAPPY THAT THE APPROACH TOWARD NORTH KOREA HAS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY, BECAUSE NOT TOO LONG AGO TRUMP WAS TWEETING OUT THINGS TOWARD KIM JONG-UN, MAKING FUN OF HIS PHYSICAL APPEARANCE, TALKING ABOUT HOW HIS NUCLEAR BUTTON IS BIGGER THAN KIM JONG-UN'S NUCLEAR BUTTON, JUST EMBARRASSING THE COUNTRY AS HE DOES, BUT WHAT HE'S SAYING NOW IS GOOD IN A DIPLOMATIC SENSE, BUT HE NOW ALSO KIND OF COMES OFF AS INCREDIBLY NAÅ“VE, AND THIS IS FOLLOWING THE MEETING WITH POMPEO, SO I WANT TO READ YOU A QUOTE FROM DONALD TRUMP. HE SAID I BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT OF GOODWILL, THEY DO RESPECT US, MEANING NORTH KOREA, WE'RE RESPECTFUL OF THEM. HE CALLED KIM JONG-UN ROCKET MAN BEFORE, HE SAID THE FAMOUS LINE ABOUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO HAVE FIRE AND FURY AND USE POWER THE LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. HE BASICALLY THREATENED TO NUKE THEM BEFORE, HE CALLED THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTH KOREA CRUEL AND BARBARIC, WHICH IS TRUE BY THE WAY. NOW HE'S LIKE THEY SAID SOME NICE THINGS ABOUT ME, THEY RESPECT ME SO I SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT BACK, OKAY? OH, WE ARE LED BY A TOTAL IMBECILE. HE'S THE EASIEST PERSON, EASIEST PERSON, TO MANIPULATE WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. BECAUSE ALL YOU NEED TO DO IF YOU WANT TO MANIPULATE HIM AND YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF HIM IS JUST COMPLEMENT HIM. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. SAY POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT HIM, SAY YOU SUPPORT HIM, NEVER TRY TO CROSS HIM, DON'T GIVE THE APPEARANCE THAT YOU HAVE AMBITIONS TO REPLACE THEM, YOU WILL BE FINE, YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU WANT. IN FACT THE LEADER OF JAPAN IS DOING THIS BALANCING ACT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HE WANTS TO ENSURE THAT THESE TARIFFS THAT TRUMP IS IMPOSING ON OTHER COUNTRIES THAT DO TRADE WITH US DON'T AFFECT HIS COUNTRY, HE DOESN'T WANT JAPAN TO BE IMPACTED, AND SO, YOU KNOW, HE'S HAVING ALL THESE CALLS AND MEETINGS WITH HIM EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE POLITICALLY SAVVY TO DO SO, CONSIDERING HOW THE U.S. IS APPROACHING NORTH KOREA RIGHT NOW. OKAY, MORE CONTEXT ON THAT, EVERY PART OF THIS IS AMAZING, SO PRIME MINISTER ABE GOES TO MAR-A-LAGO, SPENDS TWO DAYS WITH DONALD TRUMP, TRUMP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ANNOUNCES THAT POMPEO IS GOING TO MEET PERSONALLY WITH KIM JONG-UN. THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN IS NOT IN FAVOR OF THAT. SO ABE IS LIKE, WHAT? YOU GUYS ARE MEETING WITH THE NORTH KOREANS? OKAY. OF COURSE EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE. BUT THEN HE'S LIKE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THIS GUY? BUT HE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THEY AREN'T INCLUDED IN THE SANCTIONS, SO HE HAS TO SIT THERE AND KISS DONALD TRUMP'S ASS. IT'S SO HUMILIATING, SO HE GOES OUT AND HE'S LIKE, OH, MR. TRUMP, DONALD, YOU HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC. IT IS YOUR GREAT COURAGE AND LEADERSHIP THAT HAS BROUGHT THIS TO A GOOD SITUATION THAT WE ARE IN NOW. SOMEBODY HELP ME. RIGHT? BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE TO APPEASE THE MANCHILD, OTHERWISE HE WILL DO SOMETHING STUPID AND BREAK ALL THE FURNITURE. I WANT TO GO BACK TO ONE OTHER QUOTE FROM TRUMP ON NORTH KOREA. AND THEN GET TO WHAT SHOULD BE ACTUALLY DO. EARLIER HE HAD SAID WITHOUT US, AND WITHOUT ME IN PARTICULAR, I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE DISCUSSING ANYTHING, INCLUDING THE OLYMPICS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAILURE. SO HE'S SAYING THAT NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA, WHICH ARE NOW DISCUSSING A PEACE TREATY, RIGHT NOW THEY ARE IN AN ARMISTICE, SO THE WAR NEVER TECHNICALLY ENDED, TRUMP OF COURSE SAID NOBODY KNOWS THAT OKAY, MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT, THAT IS AN INTERESTING FACT, BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POLITICS KNOW IT. PEOPLE WHO ARE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES KNOW IT. BUT OF COURSE HE JUST FOUND OUT. HE'S LIKE, DID YOU KNOW? NOBODY KNOWS, THAT WAR DIDN'T ACTUALLY END, IT'S IN AN ARMISTICE. SO THEY ARE DISCUSSING A PEACE TREATY, SO WHAT DOES TRUMP SAY? THEY COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT ME, THEY WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE THE OLYMPICS TOGETHER. BUT THEY DID IT DESPITE YOU. BECAUSE HIS RHETORIC WAS SO TERRIFYING THAT LEADERS IN SOUTH KOREA WERE LIKE, OKAY, LET'S FIND A WAY TO DE-ESCALATE THIS SITUATION. SOUTH KOREA HAD TO BE THE ADULT IN THE ROOM AND GET INTO DIRECT TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA. SO I GUESS HE'S KIND OF RIGHT, YES, YOU ARE SO UNHINGED AND UNSTABLE THAT OTHER WORLD LEADERS HAVE TO BASICALLY TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL WAY AND REACH OUT TO NORTH KOREA ON THEIR OWN. I MEAN, HE'S CRAZY, HE'S CRAZY, AND IT'S SCARY WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW UNSTABLE HE IS WHEN IT COMES TO THESE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUES. REPUBLICANS, IT REALLY DOESN'T BOTHER YOU WHEN HE SAYS THINGS LIKE THE OLYMPUS WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAILURE WITHOUT HIM? IF YOU HAD A PERSON LIKE THAT IN YOUR REAL LIFE WENT AROUND BRAGGING ABOUT THINGS THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH AND MADE GRANDIOSE, PREPOSTEROUS STATEMENTS, LIKE THE GUY DOESN'T COME TO YOUR WEDDING AND HE SAYS THE WEDDING WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAILURE WITHOUT ME, YOU WOULD BE LIKE, WHO ARE YOU? YOU ARE THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD. I BROUGHT YOU AND YOUR WIFE TOGETHER. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW MY WIFE. THE GUY IS AN EGOMANIAC, AND YOU READ THAT STUFF, OH YEAH, OLYMPICS, A FAILURE WITHOUT DONALD TRUMP. REALLY? THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE SUCCUMBED TO? THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE DEGRADED TO? FINALLY ON THE POLICY, WE HAVE TRIED THIS BEFORE WITH NORTH KOREA IN THE 1990S AND RECENTLY, BOTH TIMES WHEN TRUMP SAID IT WAS SO STUPID TO TALK TO NORTH KOREA, THEY ALWAYS RENEGE ON DEALS, DON'T TALK TO THEM NOW HE'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING UNPRECEDENTED AND GO MEET WITH THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER. BUT DESPITE ALL THAT, I SAY YES. I WANT NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA TO DO A PEACE TREATY, AND NORTH KOREA PROMISES THEY ARE GOING TO DENUCLEARIZE. DO I TRUST THEM? HELL NO. THEY RENEGE ON OTHER DEALS. BUT IF YOU REMEMBER, WITH BUSH THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I USED TO GIVE BUSH CREDIT FOR, TWO THINGS, THE AMOUNT OF MONEY HE GAVE TO FIGHT AIDS IN AFRICA, THAT WAS GREAT FOR BUSH, AND HE DIDN'T GO TO WAR WITH NORTH KOREA. IF WE GO TO WAR WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS, MILLIONS DIED. IF WE KEEP DELAYING THERE IS SOME CHANCE THAT WE CAN PEACEABLY REMOVE THE DICTATOR IN NORTH KOREA AND THAT AWFUL GOVERNMENT. SO I LOVE THAT SOUTH AND NORTH KOREA ARE TRYING TO GET INTO SOME SORT OF PEACE DEAL, IF TRUMP IS IN FAVOR OF THAT, GREAT, WONDERFUL, NO MATTER HOW RIDICULOUS HE IS AND HOW HE BLUNDERS HIS WAY INTO IT. WHAT I'M AFRAID OF IS THAT SOMETHING WILL GO WRONG AND INSTEAD OF KISSING HIS ASS SOMEONE IS GOING TO ACCIDENTALLY INSULT HIM WHEN HE GOES TO MEET KIM JONG-UN, AND THEN HE'S GOING TO TRY TO PROVE HE HAS A BIGGER BUTTON. THAT'S TERRIFYING. THESE ARE TERRIFYING TIMES. IT COULD GO IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION AND IF IT DOES I WILL GIVE HIM A LOT OF CREDIT, OR IT COULD GO IN A DISASTROUS DIRECTION. SO, BRACE FOR IMPACT.
