white nationalists or neo-nazis who decided to participate in the hate rally in Virginia this past weekend are now being identified online and it has some consequences for instance they're being called what they are racist or neo-nazis or white nationalists and apparently they don't like being called those names in fact they completely disagree with the way they're being portrayed in the media now I'm gonna give you two examples of these guys and you can judge for yourselves whether or not you consider them racist now the first is a student at the University of Nevada at Reno and he's actually prominently featured in one of the photos of the hate rally that's being uh you know basically shared on the internet it's gone viral here's what he has to say about the image I came to this March for the message that white European culture has a right to be here just like every other culture it is not perfect there are flaws to it of course however I do believe that the replacement of the statue meaning the sash of robert e lee will be the slow replacement of white heritage within the united states and the people who fought and defended and built their homeland robert e lee is a great example of that he wasn't a perfect man but i want to honor and respect what he stood for during his time well he stood for slavery now i know that there's a lot of revisionist history saying no was for states rights a state right to do what oh right keep slaves and robert e lee yes it was a very good tactician on the battlefield kept the south and the war far longer than their resources should have kept them in the war so you could i guess look at youngest khan or Attila the Hun or Rommel and and/or Stalin at Stalingrad or robert e lee and say hey well that was better military tactics than we would have expected he's a good tactician and if he had won they would have enslaved all these people and made sure that they did not have any rights or freedom or Liberty and we would get to all them and rape them and Lynch them and do all the things that robert e lee and all the confederates wanted to do them don't pretend he didn't fight for Confederacy don't pretend he didn't fight for slavery because he did so when you say you want to protect that heritage well what you're saying is very very clear was there a part of robert e lee and that I missed that he's you know just loved maybe he loved planting gardening and and that's why this guy likes him he's like it's he's misunderstood he was really a better gardener than he was a Confederate General but that's not what he's known for he's known for protecting the Confederacy and he's known for being a traitor to the country that's what the Confederates were they were traitors to the country and by the way the country is called America that's right and so you're going to celebrate traitors to America don't you dare chant USA USA because that's the exact opposite of what robert e lee and the confederates stood for i know a lot of folks in the south are touchy about robert e lee cuz like oh but he was such a great general oh if we couldn't just kept our slaves if robert e lee had won alright screw you and that ideology and yes that is racist and when he talks about how they defend it how they built their homeland well that's also not really true you've got slaves to build your homeland because those Confederates were lazy they were thugs who through violence enslaved other people and they were lazy sons of bitches who didn't want to do their own work so understand what you're defending and if you're still ok with that that's fine if you think that's not racist ok we have a difference of opinion also i just want to quickly comment on the first part of his statement because he said I came to this March for the message that white European culture has a right to be here ok so I agree but who who told you that white European culture is barred from the country and doesn't have a right to be here because I don't know maybe Alex Jones told you that and that and you're drinking that kool-aid and you've bought into the fear-mongering and you're so afraid that you're gonna go ahead and join a March where you know people literally get murdered for disagreeing with you encounter protest hey snowflakes first of all for four-and-a-half out of the 45 presidents or white Europeans so you you run the country for a long long time and by the way we run like you are decent human beings didn't think I'm not a judge person by their race and so if there's a great white candidate like Bernie Sanders we love them and we support them we don't make those same kind of racial assumptions that you guys do your you know what you do you play identity politics and you're all slow snowflakes when do we need to say oh my god what European culture is being trashed because somebody said happy holidays to me wait wait somebody didn't say happy no somebody said happy holidays to me can you imagine how offended I am because there should be Merry Christmas make the Jews say Merry Christmas make the Muslims in the 80s say Merry Christmas well what I'm just trying to protect my European culture I see what you're doing maybe we're just not seeing how difficult it is to be a white male in the United States you know CEO Jobs was Steve Banta says Asians are taking some of them in Silicon Valley how dare they I thought you wanted to celebrate meritocracy not so much when it's not white he also continues to say I hope that the people sharing the photo are willing to listen that I'm not the angry racist they see in that photo take a look at graphic four again not not an angry racist you know just holding a torch in the middle in a sea of insanely racist white dudes who anyway okay look just let me be super clear I don't know if you're an idiot white nationalists out there you're watching this video and you think no how do you know they're racist they showed up with torches in it in an homage to the Ku Klux Klan the n-double-a-cp doesn't show up with torches great white leaders in this country didn't show up with torches the Klan shows up with torches they showed up with torches to defend a Confederate statue and then they chanted blood and soil which is a Nazi chant so here's where you should have gotten off the train when they handed you the torch if you didn't want to be called a racist here's what you should have gotten off the train when they were chanting white lives matter as if they the you know it's an obvious way of trying to say how hard blacks don't have no legitimate grievance in this country okay fine a lot of you like that champ because you that's just you know not white nationalism as haas cause of light nationalism right okay how about when they chanted the nazi chant how about when they chanted against the jews the jews will jews will not rule us look i'm not saying everybody in that crowd chanted that and maybe some of them didn't hear that chant but they did chant those Nazi chants those are all opportunities to leave if you weren't a racist but even if you didn't hear the chants even if you want to make a million excuses they handed you a torch at a southern rally in honor of the Confederacy yes not subtle you are also a student from Nevada you're a student from Nevada which means you spent your resources to fly to Virginia just to participate in this March right so I'm not buying this whole like no no I want peace and love for everyone and Bs that's complete BS he knows it he just doesn't like the backlash that comes along with showing your face in public while you're associated with a hate March alright and you let me just be super clear about other things he didn't run anybody over okay and and not everybody in the crowd did and that's and and so and and if you want to say hey I got a right to be for white nationalism and white supremacy just say it man just at least be honest about it don't go to that rally and then pretend you're not for white supremacy so that's what we're asking for I'm not asking for anything more than I'm not asking for anybody to lock you up I just want you to do what you did at the rally raise your hand with a torch and explain that you're for white nationalism which you are and you said you just say but despite the fact that I've told you everything that I'm in favor of I don't want you to hold it against me now you don't have that right you have the right to freedom of speech you don't have a right to be liked all right and then the second guy is actually the president of college Republicans at Washington State University he's upset that people are referring to him as racist let's go to graphic 10 he's that he identifies as paleo conservative and right-wing libertarian not as white supremacist are all right a term that he feels is a slur yeah okay yeah I hope his feelings aren't hurt though I mean that did you get triggered by that did you get triggered before you picked up the torture after you picked up the torch if you like The Young Turks you love Young Turks membership TYT Network dot-com sighs join
