1
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:00,784
CONSTRUCTION OF THE WALL.

2
00:00:00,784 --> 00:00:02,419
THEY ALREADY HAVE THE PRESIDENT

3
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,421
CONCEDE ON DACA BUT THEY PREFER

4
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,056
TO DEMAGOGUE RATHER THAN FIX THE

5
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,724
ISSUE.

6
00:00:06,724 --> 00:00:07,424
SAD REALITY.

7
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,995
JOINING US NOW FOR MORE ON OUR

8
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:11,729
TOP STORY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR

9
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:12,830
SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE

10
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,198
REPORTER, AUTHOR, IT'S OUT SOON.

11
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:14,899
JULY IS COMING.

12
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:17,701
THE RUSSIA HOAX.

13
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:20,070
GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL

14
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,604
ANALYST.

15
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:24,308
LET'S START WITH THE HEARINGS

16
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:25,943
TODAY.

17
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:26,644
AS YOU DIG DEEPER INTO THE IG

18
00:00:26,644 --> 00:00:31,315
REPORT, ALL YOU SEE ARE ALL

19
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:31,916
THESE TRUMP-HATING LEAD

20
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:32,348
INVESTIGATORS.

21
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:35,352
THEN THE VERY SAME PEOPLE, THEY

22
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:37,922
PUT THE FIX IN AND RIGGED WHAT

23
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:39,123
WOULD'VE PUT ANY OTHER AMERICAN

24
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:41,992
IN JAIL WITH HILLARY, AND THEY

25
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:42,726
IMMEDIATELY GO START THE RUSSIA

26
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:44,628
INVESTIGATION ON TRUMP.

27
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,565
DOES THAT THEN DISQUALIFY AND

28
00:00:47,565 --> 00:00:49,800
PUT INTO DOUBT FROM THE GET-GO

29
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,137
THE MUELLER WITCH HUNT?

30
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:54,405
>> IT ABSOLUTELY DOES.

31
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,207
AS JONATHAN TURLEY POINTED OUT,

32
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:59,143
THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY THAT

33
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:00,010
MUELLER CAN PURSUE OBSTRUCTION

34
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,812
OF JUSTICE AGAINST

35
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,348
PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE BOTH THE

36
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:05,649
IG AND THE ACTING

37
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,719
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS SAID COMEY

38
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,821
RICHLY DESERVED TO BE FIRED.

39
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,224
TODAY'S BEST MOMENT REALLY

40
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:14,525
HAPPENED ON THE CROSS

41
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:15,292
EXAMINATION BY SENATOR LINDSEY

42
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:15,826
GRAHAM.

43
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:19,830
HE SAID I AM NOT BUYING THIS.

44
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,564
INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE BIAS AT

45
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:22,766
THE FBI WAS SO SEVERE, SO

46
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:26,036
PERVASIVE, IT HAD TO INFLUENCE T

47
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:26,203
PERVASIVE, IT HAD TO INFLUENCE E

48
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:26,237
PERVASIVE, IT HAD TO INFLUENCE D

49
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:26,270
PERVASIVE, IT HAD TO INFLUENCE C

50
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,303
PERVASIVE, IT HAD TO INFLUENCE S

51
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:26,337
PERVASIVE, IT HAD TO INFLUENCE O

52
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:26,604
PERVASIVE, IT HAD TO INFLUENCE N

53
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:26,637
PERVASIVE, IT HAD TO INFLUENCE T

54
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:26,904
PERVASIVE, IT HAD TO INFLUENCE O

55
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:28,272
CLEAR HILLARY CLINTON.

56
00:01:28,272 --> 00:01:30,641
HE POINTED TO THE EXONERATION

57
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:31,375
STATEMENT THAT COMEY INITIALLY

58
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:35,613
FOUND CLINTON GUILTY UNDER THE

59
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:37,181
ESPIONAGE ACT BUT SOMEBODY

60
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,917
CHANGED THE LANGUAGE EVER SO

61
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:42,319
SLIGHTLY AND THAT IN ADDITION

62
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:42,987
ALLOWED COMEY TO EXONERATE

63
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:44,188
CLINTON WHEN IN FACT SHE HAD

64
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,890
COMMITTED A CRIME.

65
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,827
>> Sean: THE SWAMP ANSWER,

66
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:52,663
SARA, AS IT RELATES TO WE ARE

67
00:01:52,663 --> 00:01:53,664
NOT GOING TO SECOND-GUESS

68
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,498
PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION, AS

69
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:55,032
THEY CALL IT HERE.

70
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,402
TELL THAT TO KRISTIAN SAUCIER.

71
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:00,871
HE SPENT A YEAR IN JAIL AND

72
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,605
THERE WERE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES,

73
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:03,607
AS WE POINTED OUT IN OUR PROGRAM

74
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:04,308
AS WE POINTED OUT IN OUR PROGRA

75
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:04,642
PROGRAM.

76
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:06,810
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT HE

77
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,245
WON'T MAKE THAT DETERMINATION

78
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:10,781
BUT THEN THE ENTIRE REPORT JUST

79
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:13,684
EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE OF

80
00:02:13,684 --> 00:02:18,155
BLATANT CORRUPTION AND BIAS BY

81
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,424
THE TOP PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS

82
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:22,826
AND HOW MUCH THEY LOVE HILLARY,

83
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,228
PROTECT HER.

84
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,131
THEN THE SAME PEOPLE TAKE A

85
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:28,065
SLEDGEHAMMER AND LITERALLY TRY

86
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,100
AND DESTROY TRUMP FROM THE

87
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,434
GET-GO.

88
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:32,503
>> SEAN, I THINK THIS WAS SUCH

89
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:34,705
AN IMPORTANT HEARING TODAY.

90
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:36,607
GREGG IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY.

91
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:38,108
I THINK SENATOR GRAHAM GAVE THE

92
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:38,776
BEST CROSS-EXAMINATION EVER.

93
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:39,810
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS

94
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,012
THAT CAME OUT OF THAT.

95
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:44,815
THAT EXONERATION, THAT CHANGE IN

96
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:45,582
LANGUAGE, ACTUALLY APPEARS TO BE

97
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,585
THE INSURANCE POLICY THAT PETER

98
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,987
STRZOK WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH

99
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:53,590
LISA PAGE, HIS PARAMOUR.

100
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,225
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR AN

101
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:56,026
INSURANCE POLICY.

102
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:57,227
IN ANOTHER TEXT MESSAGE AND IN

103
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:58,395
THAT SAME TEXT MESSAGE, LET ME

104
00:02:58,395 --> 00:02:59,863
GO BACK TO THAT.

105
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:00,998
THEY TALK ABOUT ANDY'S OFFICE.

106
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:03,801
ANDY McCABE.

107
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:06,036
IT WOULD BE DEPUTY DIRECTOR

108
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:06,470
ANDREW MCCABE.

109
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,039
THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION WAS

110
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,873
THE ONE THAT SENATOR GRAHAM

111
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:10,174
ASKED.

112
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:12,609
IT WAS ANDREW MCCABE IN THAT

113
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,811
MEETING WITH PETER STRZOK AND

114
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:14,178
LISA PAGE?

115
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:16,613
AND WE NEED TO KNOW THAT FROM

116
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,415
STRZOK AND PAGE.

117
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:19,350
THOSE TWO NEED TO BE

118
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,750
INTERVIEWED.

119
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,651
AND THEN ANDREW MCCABE NEEDS TO

120
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,419
BE INTERVIEWED AGAIN.

121
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:23,253
THESE ARE THAT'S THE CASE, IF HE

122
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:26,690
WAS IN THAT MEETING, THIS IS THE

123
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,992
MOST FRIGHTENING, FRIGHTENING

124
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:32,129
EXAMPLE OF FBI POWER SINCE

125
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:32,596
J. EDGAR HOOVER.

126
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:33,430
AMERICANS SHOULD BE TERRIFIED OF

127
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,997
IT.

128
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:35,699
THEY WERE RIGGING AN ELECTION.

129
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:36,700
>> Sean: AND THAT'S THE WHOLE

130
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,368
POINT HERE.

131
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:39,703
THAT'S WHY IT'S THE BIGGEST

132
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:40,938
ABUSE OF POWER, OPTION SCANDAL

133
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:41,238
EVER.

134
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:47,211
THE SIMILARITIES IN TERMS OF THE

135
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:47,911
MUELLER INVESTIGATION AND THE

136
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:48,846
HILLARY RIGGED INVESTIGATION ARE

137
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:49,813
EERIE IN THIS WAY,

138
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:50,247
GREGG JARRETT.

139
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,750
IN AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE ALL OF

140
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,121
THESE SAME PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN

141
00:03:57,121 --> 00:04:00,424
EXPOSED HERE, AND THEN YOU LOOK

142
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:01,692
AT JEANNIE RAY AND ANDREW

143
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,827
WEISSMANN AND ALL THE DEMOCRATIC

144
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,161
DONORS.

145
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,431
IT IS THE SAME CORRUPTION THAT

146
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:09,633
WILL ONLY BE EXPOSED DOWN THE

147
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,068
LINE, ALTHOUGH WE'VE KNOWN FOR A

148
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:12,603
LONG TIME, IN ROBERT MILLER'S

149
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:13,003
WITCH HUNT.

150
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:16,273
IT'S NO DIFFERENT.

151
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:17,641
>> IT SORT OF MAKES YOU WONDER

152
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,843
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY

153
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,245
WORK AT THE FBI, PETER STRZOK,

154
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:23,046
LISA PAGE, ANDY McCABE AND

155
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:24,548
JAMES COMEY HIM AND AFTER ALL,

156
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:29,319
THEY COMMANDEERED THIS CASE AWAY

157
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,454
FROM THAT FIELD OFFICE.

158
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:32,222
WHY DID THEY DO THAT?

159
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:33,857
THEY WANTED TO CONTROL IT.

160
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,159
IT WAS ALSO BEING CONTROLLED BY

161
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,127
THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE.

162
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:39,430
THAT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR.

163
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,932
AND YES, MUELLER EXAMPLED A TEAM

164
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:43,600
OF PARTISANS, SOME OF WHOM WERE

165
00:04:43,600 --> 00:00:00,000
ALSO IN ON THE HILLARY CLINTON
