00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas my parents visited from</font>

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,300
Boston and as a gift they<font color="#E5E5E5"> bought me some</font>

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,009
gloves but these are no ordinary pair

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,290
special with their<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tron matrix Potter</font>

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,120
Time Lord technology they allow me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,860
strike my miniature telephone edition of

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,290
the ipad was keeping my hands warm and

8
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,640
that great creepy yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought they</font>

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,020
were pretty awesome gift so I showed

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,310
into my friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them said ah</font>

11
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,250
those are so cool yeah I saw them the

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,350
other day in a petrol station gas

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,150
station if you're American if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

14
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever to be a cliche of where to buy a</font>

15
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,289
last-minute gift it would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> nevermind I</font>

16
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,460
mean it's the thought that counts right

17
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,500
not the location or convenience of

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,090
purchase anyway with it been a new year

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,829
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to break the cycle</font>

20
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,239
with my bad eating<font color="#CCCCCC"> and exercise habits</font>

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,460
and so far it's going pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

22
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,469
am by no means an expert at this I

23
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,270
didn't do any research and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

24
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,680
for any advice I wonder if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,910
tell me what your healthiest option is

26
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,170
so I thought I'd explain what I've been

27
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,270
up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you have any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suggestions or</font>

28
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,770
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me a rating out of 10</font>

29
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,449
please leave fri on my way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess i</font>

30
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:58,800
should begin with a perspective of how I

31
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">was before I rarely exercised I eat</font>

32
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,760
vegetables most days but I rarely eat

33
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,010
fruit although I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> smoke and rarely</font>

34
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,229
drink my disposable income does go on

35
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,229
food because I just love it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I went</font>

36
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">straight into drastically changing my</font>

37
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,770
eating habits on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday I thought with</font>

38
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">the work week being a routine it would</font>

39
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,130
make it easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adapt and eating</font>

40
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,780
routine to it as well I've never been

41
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,580
much of a breakfast person but now I

42
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,880
start the day eating an apple hmm I know

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,770
I'm such a show-off right now I've got a

44
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,210
guy finishes it takes me an hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font>

45
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,860
half to get to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by then I've</font>

46
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,720
developed quite an appetite opposite my

47
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,729
office is a place<font color="#CCCCCC"> called jumbo eats and</font>

48
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,229
if you're ever in Piccadilly Circus in

central London i highly recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get a toasted white roll</font>

51
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,630

<font color="#E5E5E5">salmon question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know it's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

53
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,369
that healthy but is it that bad for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

54
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,590
however i do plan to start running every

55
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,420
other morning so perhaps if I treat

56
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,979
myself to such a sandwich on those

57
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,229
mornings it would be all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right yeah</font>

58
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,119
what's that you noticed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keyword</font>

59
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,299
pleione yeah yeah you got me<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I do</font>

60
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,369
want to run regularly but since starting

61
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,469
my drastic change in diet I became quite

62
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,540
ill I think the medical term is this

63
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,000
detox totally kicked my ass however if

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">there any doctors watching who could</font>

65
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,810
clarify that for me greatly appreciated

66
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,010
so yeah my<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan was get</font>

67
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,049
the diet right first overcome my illness

68
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,760
and then start a regular running routine

69
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,620
and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I have been running every</font>

70
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,360
soft and just not as much as I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,340
be and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> first like expected it</font>

72
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,549
killed me not in a sort of way but more

73
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:31,799
of a sort of way but perseverance is key

74
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:34,079
they say sometimes you cannot run or

75
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,360
hide but from an unhealthy lifestyle I

76
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,459
choose to do the former for lunch I go

77
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,799
to a cafe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a miso soup because</font>

78
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,079
it's cheap and good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I used to</font>

79
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,670
have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a bread roll but now I</font>

80
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't but I do have a banana question is</font>

81
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,260
having just miso soup in a banana<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font>

82
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,730
for lunch I tell you what's been a real

83
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,859
bitch though temptation because even

84
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:54,329
though you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be trying to be healthy</font>

85
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,620
it doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everyone else</font>

86
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,690
around you is unjust day two of my

87
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,519
healthy eating regime someone shouted

88
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">whoa I've got vouchers for pizzaexpress</font>

89
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,739
who's coming that Peter expressive

90
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're American I had to go I mean pizza</font>

91
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,420
is my favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> food but the vouchers</font>

92
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,370
were also for mains which did allow me

93
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,049
to get a salad and trust me I felt

94
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty weird ordering it because when I</font>

95
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,519
usually go to a restaurant a salad for

96
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,160
main course I mean a starter maybe but a

97
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,709
main course has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a bit like a proper</font>

98
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,040
meal and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> never saw salad as that</font>

99
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,169
and bonus points for me I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with no</font>

100
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:30,090
dressing<font color="#E5E5E5"> because everyone says that's</font>

101
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,739
bad for you ran in fact I like anything

102
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">tomato related it's tomato if you're a</font>

103
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,699
merry key cherry tomatoes sun-dried

104
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:41,489
tomatoes tomato puree tomato ketchup you

105
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,609
name it but ordinary<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomatoes look no</font>

106
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:46,290
and I think that's because my taste

107
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,629
preference is texture based I don't know

108
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,340
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone else has that with food anyway</font>

109
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,139
when I get home<font color="#CCCCCC"> from work I have a fully</font>

110
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:54,120
cooked meal with three portions of veg

111
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,040
and a point of orange juice and I always

112
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to end my evening meal with</font>

113
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:58,919
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> chocolatey because I've a</font>

114
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,590
really sweet tooth I don't know why I

115
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,780
just did there so for dessert I have an

119
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,099
but if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't get home from work till</font>

120
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,168
very late or if I've had a big meal for

121
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:17,970
lunch then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have some cereal instead</font>

122
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,579
funny story ok it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that funny I</font>

123
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,590
just had to segue you know those

124
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,360
pre-roll commercials<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sometimes get</font>

125
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,979
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching some media content</font>

126
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,870
online well one time I was on stick

127
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,120
calm which is where I host my life show

128
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,520
and I saw some pre-roll for a healthy

129
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,380
product I do feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is this inner</font>

130
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,479
ego within us all that we'd like to

131
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,130
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would never be persuaded by</font>

132
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,229
pre-roll but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll happily put my hand up</font>

133
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:43,530
and say it worked specifically developed

134
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,360
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the active part of oats to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

135
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,270
lower cholesterol but what's this what a

136
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,800
mysterious thing to put at the end of

137
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,750
such a bold statement see you then spend

138
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,040
the next half an hour trying to find out

139
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,990
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> asterix relates to so overall</font>

140
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">my eating habits have got a lot better</font>

141
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,620
and I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> admit I am quite proud of</font>

142
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,360
myself because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just didn't think I was</font>

143
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,130
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do it as my eating</font>

144
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,169
and exercise habits have been poor for a

145
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,030
very very long time but when you educate

146
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,070
yourself about issues you just have to

147
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,330
do something about it it's about

148
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,639
breaking the cycle and I'm gonna see

149
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:18,419
this through<font color="#CCCCCC"> adios the next time that</font>

150
00:05:18,419 --> 00:00:00,000
was exhausting and I I hurt my<font color="#E5E5E5"> foot</font>
