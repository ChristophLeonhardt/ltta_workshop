if there's one thing New Yorkers love its their bagels but there's a new shop in the village that's trying to get New Yorkers to give up their beloved breakfast treat in exchange for these bagel balls so at least can you tell me what is a Bantam so phantom bagels are mini bagel balls and they're all filled we have the Bleecker Street that's our homage of the block the pizza flavor marinara mozzarella cream cheese slice of pepperoni on top then we have grandma Jojo if Italian seasoned bagel marinated tomato on top pesto cream cheese the best snack option I think is a hot pretzel it has a salt on the outside and then if you go chattering and how do you make them well they're made in a different shape and they're filled instead of topped they're made in the classic New York way how do you eat a bantam dude take a couple bites you just pop the whole thing in your mouth our underground slogan here is bite the hole so find the hole right where the cream cheese went in and you bite the holes that way the cream cheese stays there you go it's really good yeah it's a good like bagel of filling ratio so now we brought some Bantam bagels back for everyone to try so what do you think about these bagel balls so at first glance they don't really look like bagels they're kind of like munchkins or a doughnut they go punch them like bagel balls and that looks like it's got some cheese or something make sure you break the hole actually say advancing bagels that's a new approach it's it's sort of like what hotpot could start a pizza this is the bagels make it through think about it a little bit you know I think it's pretty good does it compare it's like a real bagel yeah I think it does it's good because it could be like annoying that to carry around a bagel I would not eat this flavor because I don't really like sweet bagels but maybe if there was a different flavor that I liked better I would consider it how's the filling to bagel bread ratio they're pretty fill how surprised I hope it'll be the macaronis but yeah you know it's weird Blackie's fall in your mouth this week I'm not super soul I chose my bagel like a decade and a half ago s you know he's in the kitchen yeah that's nice but it's really messy so I probably wouldn't want to do that haha you know when when you say flight the whole I I thought like eat the whole thing which I realize in retrospect cream cheese filled up gonna do right
