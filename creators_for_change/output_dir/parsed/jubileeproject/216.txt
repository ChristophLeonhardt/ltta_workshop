you ready alright let's do this hey
everyone this is Eric from the Jubilee
project and we have a very special guest
with us today hi everyone my name is
Christine ha I hope you enjoyed the
films in case you were wondering I was
diagnosed with the disease called nmo
about 10 years ago which attacked my
spinal cord and optic nerves often
causing paralysis and blindness I didn't
think I could move past it but I really
believe that each one of us has so much
potential but we're often limited by our
own fears and doubts
I hope my story can inspire you to find
that thing you absolutely love and never
give up on it no matter what it was
great working with the Jubilee project

scenes video
