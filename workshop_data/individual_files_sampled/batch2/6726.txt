more and more men in Hollywood are coming out and sharing their stories of getting sexually assaulted or sexually harassed in the industry which is good not good that they got sexually assaulted but it's important for men to come out and speak about their experiences as well because this is not an issue that only impacts women now Kevin Sorbo who politically speaking I have no love for recently shared how he was sexually harassed by Gianni Versace who is no longer alive he died however apparently Versace had us not only sexually harassed him but put his hands on Sorbo and he shared the story during a podcast with Adam Corolla so here's what he had to say all of a sudden his hand goes up my leg and he says dude do you know I'm straight and respond she allegedly responds to him by saying this is why I like you you're not a girly man you are a man's man in life you must eff everything you must do the dog and the cat and the boy and the girl agree to disagree yeah you don't have to do any of that yeah I had a very unfortunate analogy that I'm going to now needlessly share with you get myself in trouble you know people will say like forever like ah you just gotta try you got to try everything once yeah I always thought no I don't I've never had sex with a rhino I don't have to try that once to know that I'm not going to enjoy it right so now you don't have to do the dog or the cat and if you're Kevin Sorbo straight he strained you know what I'm gonna do you and of course the much more important thing as they get in the power dynamic rasathi had a very important modeling job this suburb could have gotten this was earlier in his career obviously when he was a model and before he even went on to acting and I don't agree with Sorbo politically at all okay he said some things that really got under my skin but that affects this story zero percent he's absolutely right and I and I generally definitely believe his allegations yeah I I lived in Miami when Versace did know I'm sorry he got shot right before I moved to Miami okay and and the stories were he had a house a gorgeous house right on Ocean Avenue and a net like this giant telescope and it was not for looking at the Stars but look for looking at young men at the beach and then he would pull them into his house like somebody would come out and go Gianni Versace would like to see you right now you didn't hear the rest of the story but it's not surprising to hear that this is what would happen sometimes geez okay well you know again I'm glad Sorbo shared you know his take because I think men are even less willing to come out and talk about their experiences because you know there's even more stigma toward men who talk about it right they're supposed to be strong they're supposed to like have no emotion but no they get victimized too and they should feel comfortable speaking out so people are brought to justice in this case Versace won't be brought to justice but it will at least open the door for other men who have had similar experiences in the industry now he didn't end up getting that modeling deal because he didn't cave in to you know these advances so he talks about that a little bit as well he said that Versace had booked me for his fashion shows but I never got his campaign but I knew the game just like I know the game of Hollywood casting couches have always been around I don't play that game nor do I care to as I've said before I think this is actually tip of the iceberg I don't know if we're ever gonna find out about the whole iceberg but in terms of men who abuse their power who happen to be gay in Hollywood because we found out about the men who were straight who have abused their power but men are men and so it is unlikely that men who are attracted to other guys are somehow different than men overall and I have heard a lot of total rumors and nothing substantiative I knew I tell you but but there's a constant chatter about gay powerful folks in Hollywood who have done this and this is one now he's not exactly Hollywood Versace's fashion right etc and I don't by the way it it is definitely not me saying that they that gay Hollywood is any different than straight Hollywood my point is the exact opposite which is men are men they're all the same and so if more stories like this came out I wouldn't be surprised and and in this case he said no hey you know anyway but okay so I have a very quick question asking you say men are men and I feel like that and I know you don't mean to say this which is why I want you to like clarify it that makes it seem like as soon as a guy is in a position of power he's gonna abuse his power which I don't think is true at all right I've come across a lot of powerful men who have never ever made me feel harassed or assaulted or anything like that it's just I think the part of this that shocks even me is how incredibly commonplace it is in certain industry and probably not even in certain industries probably in every industry right like I think I underestimated how often this kind of stuff happens but I don't think that most men are like this or all men are like this not even close I just think that we've underestimated just how many powerful people there are out there that take advantage of those that don't have as much power yeah well so that let me be clear so do I think all men are doing it right now of course not right do I think a way higher percentage of women and men in positions of power did it earlier 1960s 70s etc yes I think we were naive in not realizing to what degree that happened before and it is partly a dynamic of man because men are interested in sex more than women I don't mean I know that's a totally gross generalization I mean in this sense right and and take all the generalizations for whatever you want but it's not that women don't want to have sex is that they actually care to be attracted to men in some way that is not just physical right whereas men more often focus on the physical both straight and gay men right so they're like okay you're here I have power over you I'm interested in this and and so there's that that proportion of it that it relates to men the more important portion relates to power and so however much power you have and the reason that in the 60s 70s etc they had more power is because women had incredible difficulty breaking into industries there was almost no women in those industries and in order to get past the gatekeepers these guys had disproportionate power and unfortunately power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely the reason it happens more in Hollywood as well and sometimes in politics is because there is very few jobs in those industries there's only a couple of dozen great acting jobs per year especially in the old days there were less movies that were being made so and same for fashion same for music and if you are a gatekeeper in that time well you know you had this absolute power in a sense and that is why I'm now looking back at it we shouldn't be surprised at how much it was abused watch The Young Turks commercial-free downloaded or stream it watch it any way you like at TYT
