00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:06,349
RACE.

3
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:10,553
THIS BRO-MANCE HAS SOME CRITICS

00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,878
COOL AND OTHER RAP ARTISTS

10
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:35,485

MEAN YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT.

14
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:46,089
>> THEN THE ROLE REVERSALS.

15
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:47,897
CONSERVATIVES NEVER LIKED KANYE

16
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:52,395

PEOPLE.

20
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:56,804
>> KANYE WEST SEES BLACK

00:01:00,714 --> 00:01:02,633
HE IS YOU KNOW WHAT TRUMP DID A

25
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:05,165
BETTER JOB THAN THE DEMOCRATS.

INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.

30
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:13,416
I THINK KANYE WEST LOST HIS

31
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:13,716

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,222
THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

35
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:23,026
HE IS A SERIOUS BUSINESSMAN.

36
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:28,031

00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:31,234
TWEETED THAT THE MEDIA ARE

38
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:32,535
TRYING TO DEMONIZE HIM.

39
00:01:32,535 --> 00:01:35,939
>> FOR KANYE WEST'S SIN OF
