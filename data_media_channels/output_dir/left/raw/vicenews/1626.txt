we should share and I might say I might

even add there's enough money in this

start so we're going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and watch it</font>

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,760
from the spin room which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically an</font>

air-conditioned political Hunger Games

26
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,140
where politicians from both sides pile

in at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the debate and try and</font>

28

persuade the media waiting there which

side is one

30
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,930
if the countries across Europe are not

<font color="#E5E5E5">about uncontrollable numbers coming here</font>

39

and putting pressure on public services

40
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,250
it's all about security we both leave

41
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,270
and take back control I believe that

42
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,880
this Thursday could be our country's

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:16,010
independence day so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just come to</font>

campaigners from the remain unlived

47

camps on the floor it was at times

48
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,700
chaotic debate both sides were accusing

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,050
the other of lying and of getting their

50
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,580
facts wrong so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like the</font>

51
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,290
narratives will be shaped<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the people</font>

52
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,640
in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind us now</font>

53
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,340
what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make of the debate who did</font>

54
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,230
you think one I thought in footballing

55
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,870
terms this was a 4-1 victory to the

56
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,880
remain side I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the leave campaign</font>

57
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,730
one on the basis they were more balanced

58
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,280
or we golfin leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> Campion is a slogan</font>

59
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,780
that they were reputed relentlessly

60
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,250
about taking back control but leave

61
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,100
Leave were hitting the right note in

62
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,530
terms of the tone of the debate if you

63
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,930
sum up the the night then remain had

64
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,690
answers detail back by the experts and

65
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,580
the leaf sorry was all who's all bluster

66
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,500
it's currently some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feeding</font>

67
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,920
frenzy on Michael Gove we're in this

68
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,570
weird place to spin room where people

69
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,550
keep telling us<font color="#E5E5E5"> two narratives are going</font>

70
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,290
to be shape how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you describe this</font>

71
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,930
place to an undecided voter well I think

72
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a little bit ridiculous I mean</font>

73
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">there the whole process of going through</font>

74
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,880
this situation where you have a bunch of

75
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,110
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling you what they already saw</font>

76
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,150
how would you describe this place weird

77
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,160
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean all these people everybody knows</font>

78
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,170
each other it's quite ancestors there is

79
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,560
a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a bubble and I think sometimes</font>

80
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,820
people can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get very obsessed with the</font>

81
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,460
drama of it all if I'm absolutely honest

82
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,800
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the vast majority of people have</font>

83
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,990
already made up their mind I would be

84
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,570
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised if there's anything</font>

85
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,250
more than maybe five percent of people

86
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,420
that is still under

87
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,430
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pointless this is just</font>

88
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of those things that politicians end</font>

89
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,340
up doing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll take it all with a</font>

90
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,140
pinch of salt I've is that all that I'm

91
00:04:09,140 --> 00:00:00,000
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> confident</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remaining one tonight</font>
