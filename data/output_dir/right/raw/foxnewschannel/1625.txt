YOU HAVE SAID IT OVER A YEAR.

37
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:35,935
WE POINTED IT OUT REPEATEDLY.

38
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:38,471
THE MEDIA GOT THE ASPECTS OF

39
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:41,441
THIS WRONG AND IGNORED THE REAL

40
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:43,543
WRONG AND A PUCE OF POWER AND

41
00:01:43,543 --> 00:01:45,344
BEEN ON A WITCH HUNT GOING ON

42
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:46,512
OVER A YEAR.

43
00:01:46,512 --> 00:01:47,714

00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:55,822
SOME TRUTH NEEDS TO COME OUT.

46
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:56,222
SIR?

47
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:58,558
>> THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION HAS

48
00:01:58,558 --> 00:02:04,430
REVEAL WOULD THE GREATEST

49
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,265
PEPITATOR AGAINST THE AMERICAN

50
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:07,633
PEOPLE WAS THE GOVERNMENT AND

51
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:13,606
WAS THE FBI, CIA, AND NATIONAL

52
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:15,208
INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR.

53
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,809
>> Sean: TOP RANK AND FILE.

54
00:02:16,809 --> 00:02:19,712
>> I WANT TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT

55
00:02:19,712 --> 00:02:20,046
LEVEL.

56
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:21,314
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

57
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:23,683
STATES WILL NOT BE INDICTED AND

58
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:26,519
IF HE IS, HE WILL TAKE IT TO THE

59
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:27,653
SUPREME COURT AND WIN.

60
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:30,723
WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN

61
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:31,057
AGAIN.

62
00:02:31,057 --> 00:02:32,358
WE SAW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

63
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:33,760
USED BY THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION

64
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,129
AND HEAD OF THE CIA AND FBI AND

65
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,197
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND MANY,

66
00:02:38,197 --> 00:02:41,667
MANY OTHERS USED TO DESTROY THE

67
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,504
CANDIDACY OF AN OPPOSITION

68
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,139
CANDIDATE OF THE OTHER PARTY,

69
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,540
DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN

70
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:47,907
PARTY.

71
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:50,476
THOO THAT IS, THE PRESIDENT'S

72
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:53,279
EXISTING ADMINISTRATION AND

73
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,615
INTERFERING IN THE ELECTIONS AND

74
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:57,717
WE NEVER SAW THIS BEFORE IN

75
00:02:57,717 --> 00:02:58,384
AMERICAN HISTORY.

76
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:00,953
WE KNOW THAT THE OBAMA

77
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:02,755
ADMINISTRATION SPIED, LOOK, IT

78
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:04,190
IS IT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

79
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,659
AND HE'S THE PRESIDENT AND THE

80
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,427
BUCK STOPS AT HIS DESK AND HE

81
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:11,631
MAY BE PLAYING AROUND HIS

82
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:16,269
LIBRARY IN CHICAGO AND HE IS BE

83
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:17,403
HELD RESPONSIBLE.

84
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:20,740
THE FISA COURT FAILED US.

85
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,974
WE HAVE NATIONAL SECURITY

86
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:24,777
LETTERS THAT ARE USED IN EXTREME

87
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:26,512
CIRCUMSTANCES BEING USED AND

88
00:03:26,512 --> 00:03:29,715
A FBI AGENTS THAT TOOK IT UPON

THEMSELVES TO INVESTIGATE

90
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,822
A CANDIDATE AND HIS CAMPAIGN AND

91
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:38,858
ACTUAL SPIES IN THE TRUMP

92
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:39,258
CAMPAIGN.

93
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:40,293
WHAT IS IT?

94
00:03:40,293 --> 00:03:43,796
THE SOVIET UNION OR VENEZUELA OR

95
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:44,697
CENTRAL AMERICA?

96
00:03:44,697 --> 00:03:46,833
IT IS THE UNITED STATES OF

97
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,200
AMERICA.

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,637
ONCE MR. MUELLER TURNS OVER THE

99
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:54,841
REPORT TO MR. ROSENSTEIN.

100
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:57,176
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD PICK

101
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:58,177
FAVORITE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY.

102
00:03:58,177 --> 00:04:00,279
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE PALS.

103
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:02,748
BUT GIVE HIM AN ASSIGNMENT.

104
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:04,750
I DON'T CARE WHAT JEFF SESSIONS.

105
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,052
AND TELL HIM.

106
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:09,055
I WANT YOU TO INVESTIGATE THE

107
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:09,889
ACTIVITIES THAT TOOK PLACE IN

108
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:12,592
THIS ELECTION AND LET THE CHIPS

109
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:14,126
FALL WHERE THEY MAY.

110
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:16,228
AND THE INNERFERRANCE BY THE FBI

111
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:18,964
AND CIA AND NATIONAL

112
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:19,432
INTELLIGENCE.

113
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:21,868
AND BRENNAN AND CLAPPER AND

114
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:22,635
COMEY DID.

115
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:26,405
NOT BECAUSE I AM GOING TO PUNISH

116
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:26,739
THEM.

117
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:29,876
YOU AM MAKE DETERMINATION.

118
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:32,111
>> Sean: SUSAN RICE.

119
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:35,815
>> I WOULD ALSO TELL THEM TO FIX

120
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:36,182
THIS.

121
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:38,484
WE CAN'T HAVE AN ELECTION WHERE

122
00:04:38,484 --> 00:04:41,220
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

123
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,755
INTERFERING WITH AN ELECTION AND

124
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:45,291
I THINK THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO

125
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,895
DO TO APPOINT A COMMISSION OF 5

126
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:52,798
OR 7 PEOPLE AND TOP NOTCH MEN

127
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:54,533

INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND WE

131
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:03,309
CAN'T ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN TO

132
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:04,877
ANOTHER PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED

133
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:05,444
STATES.

134
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:09,015
TO HELL, SORRY JEFF, JEFF

135
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:11,183
SESSIONS AND ALL OF THE OTHER

136
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:11,550
PEOPLE.

137
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,352
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD TAKE

138
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:13,853
RESPONSIBILITY.

139
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:15,154
>> Sean: DON'T APOLOGIZE.

140
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:17,857
>> YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SPIES

141
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:18,991
IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND

142
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,960
FAIL WOULD FISA COURT.

143
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,396
THIS IS INCREDIBLE STUFF.

144
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,197
>> Sean: YOU TALK ABOUT THE

145
00:05:25,197 --> 00:05:25,631
SPIES.

146
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,168
IT WAS NOT JUST ONE FISA COURT

147
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:31,103
JUDGE GIVEN PHONY INFORMATION

148
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:34,807
THAT WAS NEVER VERIFIED OR

149
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:37,610
VERIFIED AND NEVER TOLD THAT

150
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,045
HILLARY CLINTON PAID FOR THE

151
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:39,545
INFORMATION.

152
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:42,348
WHERE IS CONGRESS?

153
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:45,351
WHY WON'T CONGRESS BRING THESE

154
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:50,890
FISA JUDGES AND DEMAND WHAT THEY

155
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,223
FEEL.

156
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:53,960
>> UNLIKE THE DEMOCRATS, THE

157
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,696
REPUBLICANS SCATTERED LIKE RATS.

158
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:58,230
YOU HAVE CERTAIN REPUBLICANS WHO

159
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,999
ARE IN WITH THE DEMOCRATS

160
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:02,702
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DESTROY THE

161
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:03,102
PRESIDENT.

162
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:05,905
THEY CANNOT GET OVER THE FACT HE

163
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:07,540
WAS ELECTED.

164
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,774
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T

165
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:10,943
KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

166
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,745
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING

167
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:15,915
HERE SO GUESTS CAN REPEAT IT.

168
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:18,751
WE NEED AN ACCOUNTING OF WHAT

169
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:21,420
MR. BRENNAN DOES AND CLAPPER DID

170
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,190
AND BOOK SALES MAN COMEY DID AND

171
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,026
SUSAN RICE AND SAMANTHA POWERS

172
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:27,326
DID.

173
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:29,996
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THE

174
00:06:29,996 --> 00:06:33,699
UNMASKING STUFF NOT BECAUSE WE

175
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:36,702
WANT TO GET EVEN.

176
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:39,772
WE NEED TO FIX THESE DEPARTMENTS

177
00:06:39,772 --> 00:06:42,174
AND AGENCIES.

178
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:44,243
>> Sean: IT IS NOT A JOKE.

179
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:47,747
IF WE DON'T FIX IT, WE LOSE OUR

180
00:06:47,747 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRY.
