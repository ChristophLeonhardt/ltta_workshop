THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE
HAS DEALT WITH A NUMBER OF
OBSTACLES, PROTESTERS,
REGULATIONS, PEOPLE WHO DO
NOT WANT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE
PIPELINE TO CONTINUE.
AS YOU CAN REMEMBER AT THE END
OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,
THE TRANS CANADA WHICH IS THE
COMPANY, THE CORPORATION BEHIND
THE KEYSTONE NEXTEL PIPELINE DID
EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO
GET OBAMA TO APPROVE THE PERMITS
TO FURTHER CONSTRUCTION.
OBAMA SAID NO, TRUMP COMES IN
AND SAYS YES, YOU CAN
CONTINUE WITH CONSTRUCTION AND
NOW IT TURNS OUT, DUE TO
SIMPLE ECONOMICS, YOU MIGHT NOT
EVEN HAPPEN.
THEY MIGHT EVEN BUILD THE REST
OF THE PIPELINE.
LIMIT ME THE DETAILS ON THIS.
THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT
FOR TRANS CANADA HAD A CALL
WITH INVESTORS AND HE IS LIKE
YO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE PRICE
OF OIL IS PRETTY LOW,
PRODUCING OIL IS PRETTY HIGH.
MAYBE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
TOGETHER WITH THIS PROJECT
AFTER ALL.
LOW OIL PRICES AND THE HIGH COST
OF EXTRACTING CANADIAN CRUDE
FROM OIL SANDS ARE CASTING NEW
DOUBTS ON KEYSTONE XL AS
EXECUTIVES WITH THE CANADIAN
COMPANY THAT WANTS TO BUILD
A FACE THE FINAL REGULAR
REGULATORY HURDLE NEXT WEEK
IN NEBRASKA.
KEEP IN MIND THAT NEBRASKA'S
ONLY STATE THAT HAS AN
APPROVED IT JUST YET, AND THAT
IS BECAUSE THE FARMERS IN
THE STATE THAT ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT THEIR CROPS.
THE PIPELINE WOULD ESSENTIALLY
GO TO THEIR PROPERTY AND IT
COULD BE DAMAGING FOR THEIR
BUSINESS, FOR THEIR
AGRICULTURE AND SO TRANS CANADA,
AND A TRANSCANADA EXECUTIVE
RAISED EYEBROWS IN THE INDUSTRY
LAST WEEK
WHEN HE SUGGESTED THAT THE
PIPELINE DEVELOPER DOESN'T
KNOW WHETHER IT WILL MOVE
FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT.
PAUL MILLER, AND EXECUTIVE VICE
PRESIDENT WHO IS EVERYTHING
THE PROJECT, TOLD AN INVESTOR
CALL THE COMPANY OFFICIALS
WILL DECIDE UNTIL LATE NOVEMBER
OR EARLY DECEMBER WHETHER
TO START CONSTRUCTION.
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW
MUCH THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE
THEY BEGAN CONSTRUCTION, CRUDE
OIL WAS TRADING AT AROUND $49.50
A BARREL ON WEDNESDAY THIS WEEK,
AND THAT IS DOWN FROM THE
HIGHS OF MORE THAN $100 IN 2014.
AGAIN, PRICES HAS DIPPED
CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR LIKE
WE DON'T KNOW THAT UP ANYMORE.
MARCUS?
HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM PREMARKET
QUEST OF THIS IS REPORT FOR
A NUMBER OF REASONS.
PERSONAS IMMEDIATE ISSUE.
THE CRUDE OIL THAT COMES
FROM CANADA IS THE MOST
EXPENSIVE KIND OF OIL TO
EXTRACT.
THEY BEGAN THESE PROJECTS WHEN
OIL PRICES WERE REALLY HIGH
AND WHEN OIL PRICES ARE REALLY
HIGH THEN IT IS WORTH GOING
THROUGH THAT EXPENSE TO EXTRACT
IT.
IS ALSO SOME OF THE DIRTIEST
FOSSIL FUEL THERE IS ON THE
PLANET.
THERE IS MORE CARBON THAT GOES
IN THE AIR BECAUSE OF THIS TYPE
OF OIL THAT IS IN CANADA.
IT IS
NOT THE ONLY PLACE IT IS IN
BUT CANADA HAS A HUGE RESERVOIR
OF IT.
SO IF OIL PRICES ARE HIGH THEN
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A HUGE
ECONOMIC INCENTIVE.
WHICH IS MAKE UP NUMBERS TO KEEP
IT SIMPLE THOUGHT IT COST YOU
50 BUCKS TO GET THE OIL OUT OF
THE GROUND, BUT THE OIL IS
TRADING AT 100 BUCKS, EVEN
WITH THE TRANSPORTATION AND
DISTRIBUTION AND ALL THAT STUFF,
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE
A HEALTHY PROFIT MARGIN.
BUT IS NOW ALL THE SUDDEN THE
PRICES ARE $50, THAT IS THE
PRICE TO EXTRACTED.
IT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO MAKE ANYMORE.
TO GO FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT.
ONE OF THE REASONS OIL PRICES
ARE GOING DOWN IS BECAUSE
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER SOURCES
OF ENERGY NOW WHICH DIDN'T
EXIST AND WE HAD INCREDIBLY HIGH
OIL PRICES EARLIER ON.
SOME OF WHICH EXISTED BUT WERE
AT A MUCH LOWER LEVEL.
SOME ARE GROWING EXPONENTIALLY
NOW.
KEEPING IT REAL, IT IS NOT JUST
RENEWABLE ENERGY.
FRACKING IS KILLING OIL.
FRACKING IS A REALLY INTERESTING
TOPIC AND IT HAS BIG UPSIDES,
BUT POTENTIALLY MUCH BIGGER
DOWNSIDES BUT ONE OF THE UPSIDES
IS THAT AT LEAST IT BRINGS DOWN
THE PRICE BECAUSE THERE IS MORE
SUPPLY FOR REAL ECONOMIST, YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT SUPPLY AND
DEMAND IS UNLIKE RICK PERRY WHO
THINKS SUPPLY AND DEMAND
WORKS, IF YOU MORE SUPPLY YOU
HAVE MORE DEMAND.
THAT SOMEHOW WORKS AT ALL.
THIS IS ALSO GREAT NEWS FOR THE
FUTURE ON A BIGGER SCALE BECAUSE
FRACKING HAS A LOT OF DOWNSIDES
BUT RENEWABLE ENERGY DOES NOT
HAVE VERY MANY DOWNSIDES AND IT
IS ALSO GROWING EXPONENTIALLY.
WHEN IT DOES, IT BECOMES CHEAPER
TO MAKE BECAUSE YOU HAVE
ADVANTAGES IN TECHNOLOGY THAT
YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT
YOU HAVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE YOU
COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AND SO
THE BIGGER RENEWABLE ENERGY
GETS, THE LOWER ITS COST IS AND
THAT IT COMPETES WITH OIL AND
THERE IS A CERTAIN POINT AT
WHICH EXTRACTING CRUDE OIL NO
LOVING OR MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE.
THIS IS HOW A FREE MARKET IS
SUPPOSED TO WORK.
WHERE YOU HAVE COMPETITION FROM
COMPETING INDUSTRIES, COMPETING
SOURCE OF ENERGY AND YOU DON'T
HAVE THE OIL INDUSTRY OR THE
COAL INDUSTRY OR ANY INDUSTRY
HAVING A MONOPOLY ON THE
WAY ENERGY IS PRODUCED IN THE
UNITED STATES BECAUSE THAT
IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT IS BEEN
HAPPENING FOR VERY LONG OF TIME.
YOU HAVE LOBBYISTS WORKING FOR
BIG OIL, WORKING WITH
POLITICIANS, FUNDING POLITICIANS
IN ORDER TO PREVENT ANY TYPE OF
INVESTMENT TOWARD RENEWABLE
ENERGY OTHER ENERGY.
WE'VE HAD CRONY CAPITALISM IN
THIS REGARD FOR A VERY LONG
TIME AND IT IS NICE TO SEE THAT
EVEN THOUGH WE STILL HAVE
CRONY CAPITALISM, THERE ARE
FORCES THAT ARE FIGHTING
AGAINST IT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN
DEFEAT SOME OF THE DIRTIER
FORMS OF ENERGY THAT WE ARE
REDUCING.
AND YOU GUYS SAY LOOK, WHY
DON'T YOU JUST LET THE FREE
MARKET DECIDE.
DO COAL COME ALL THIS STUFF AND
THEN MAYBE YOUR RENEWABLE
ENERGY WILL WIN OUT IN THE END.
IS LIVING OUT RIGHT NOW, BUT
THERE ARE ALSO COSTS YOU
ARE NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT.
WHEN THEY TAKE THE FOSSIL FUELS
OUT OF THE GROUND, THEY DON'T
PAY THE COST OF THE COMMON THAT
GOES INTO THE SKY AND THE CARBON
IN THE AIR IS A COST THAT IS
PAID BY ALL OF US.
WHEN YOU GET TO PRIVATIZE THE
GAINS AND SOCIALIZE THE LOSSES?
THAT IS NOT FREE MARKET EITHER.
IT IS PERFECTLY RATIONAL TO SAY
THAT IN TERMS OF THE CARBON COST
OF THIS CRUDE OIL IS NOT WORTH
IT TO CANADA, THE CITIZENS
OF CANADA OR AMERICA THE WORLD
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO
THAT I'M WE'RE GOING TO SAY IT'S
OKAY BECAUSE RENEWABLE ENERGY
IS GOING TO COME UP ANYWAY AND
IT TURNS OUT WE WERE RIGHT.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO THIS KIND OF
FOSSIL FUEL.
ALL IT DID WAS HURT THE PLANET
AND THEY NEVER PROPERLY
PAID FOR ITS COST.
