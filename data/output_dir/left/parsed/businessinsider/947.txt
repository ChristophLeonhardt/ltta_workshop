there were other immigrants who came
here in the bottom of slave ships worked
even longer even harder for less that's
what America is about
a land of dreams and opportunity there
were other immigrants who came here in
the bottom of slave ships worked even
longer even harder for less but they too
had a dream that one day their sons
daughters grandsons granddaughters great
grandsons great granddaughters might
pursue prosperity and happiness in this
land
