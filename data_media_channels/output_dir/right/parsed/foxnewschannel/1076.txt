GATHER.
CONNOR POWELL IS LIVE ON THE
BORDER.
CONNOR.
>> Reporter: NEARLY THREE MONTHS
OF THE WEEKLY PROTEST.
THE QUESTION IS WILL THIS
CONTINUE TO ESCALATE.
WE SAW VIOLENT CLASHES WHERE 60
PALESTINIANS WERE KILLED AND
THERE HAVE BEEN CLASHES AND
SEVERAL MOLOTOV COCKTAILS AND
THERE'S BEEN MANY INJURED BUT
WE'VE SEEN SMALLER GROUPS OF
PEOPLE ALONG THE BORDER.
THERE'S NOT BEEN THE VIOLENCE
WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY BUT THE BIG
CHANGES IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS
IS THE MILITANTS IN GAZA ARE
USING KITES ON FIRE AND SENDING
THEM ACROSS THE BORDER TO START
FIRES IN THESE FIELDS.
IT'S DONE A LOT OF DAMAGE TO
ISRAELI FIELDS.
THE REASON IT'S SIGNIFICANT IS
WE SAW ROCKET FIRE COMING FROM
GAZA.
THESE DIFFICULTS ARE MORE
DIFFICULT TO CONTROL WHERE THEY
LAND AND TAKE OFF.
IT'S A BIG CHANGE IN TERMS OF
TACTICS BY THE MILITANTS IN GAZA
