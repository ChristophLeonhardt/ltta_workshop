1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:02,869

00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,545
THE NEXT DAY.

8
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,280
WE HAVE BEEN HAVING THEM FOR

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,384
QUITE SOME TIME.

10
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,420
SINCE YOU FIRST GAINED OFFICE,

11
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,287
AND YOU ARE DOING A TERRIFIC

12
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,122
JOB.

13
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,290
I THINK WE ARE DOING A TERRIFIC

14
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,658
JOB TOGETHER.

15
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:27,661
WE HAVE HAD TERRIFIC TALKS ON

16
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,763
TRADE, AND WILL BE SIGNING IN A

17
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,765

18
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,300
TRADE AGREEMENT WITH SOUTH KOREA

19
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:33,300
TRADE AGREEMENT WITH SOUTH KOREA

20
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,536
AND THE UNITED STATES.

21
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,237
AND I THINK IT IS A VERY

22
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:39,607
EXCITING EVENT.

23
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:41,242
IT WAS LONG TIME IN COMING AND

24
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:44,478
IT IS A BASIC REDOING OF THE

25
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:45,980
AGREEMENT THAT WAS DONE BEFORE,

26
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,848
WHICH WAS A VERY UNFAIR

27
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,851
AGREEMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES.

28
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:49,851
AGREEMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES.

29
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:52,587
I THINK THAT PRESIDENT MOON AND

30
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:55,456
MYSELF ARE VERY HAPPY.

31
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,891
IT IS GREAT FOR THE

32
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:57,625
SOUTH KOREANS, IT IS GREAT FOR

33
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,160
THE UNITED STATES, IT IS GREAT

34
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,727
FOR BOTH.

35
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,963
WE HAVE TALKED, OBVIOUSLY, ABOUT

00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:01,963

00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:02,363
NORTH KOREA.

38
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:03,765
WE ARE MAKING TREMENDOUS

39
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:06,401
PROGRESS.

40
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,469
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS BEEN REALLY,

41
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,204
VERY OPEN AND TERRIFIC, FRANKLY.

42
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:10,204
VERY OPEN AND TERRIFIC, FRANKLY.

43
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:13,541
I THINK HE WANTS TO SEE

44
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,511
SOMETHING HAPPEN.

45
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,012
SO, MUTUALLY WE HAVE DONE VERY

46
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:20,782
WELL WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA

47
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:20,782
