is it a leasing solution is it a political solution is it a medical solution it all of the above I would imagine and visually right what is it what do you do what is the solution because I'll tell you fort lauderdale right we don't have a big PD we're a pretty comfortable city financially I mean with every city has its problems but got a strong enough tax base a lot of high net worth people living in Fort Lauderdale on the east side what is this city do you can't devote all your cops to this problem well cops in places like New York LA in Philadelphia would kill to have Fort Lauderdale's troubles because Fort Lauderdale could literally process a prisoner or refer them to a hospital within 45 minutes and be back on the street very twitter is the average processing time in a city like Philly's three hours so we have a situation right now where obviously we need to ramp up enforcement stop telling the cops to get hands off because wherever homeless addicts and mental patients are ancillary crime like drug dealing is occurring getting there in intervene not Scott Joplin so you're saying and I agree with you wholeheartedly are we need to go back to would Giuliani did in 1994 a broken windows policing strategy hey Kerry little things the big things will follow so that's point one right so you go back to the enforcement obviously but you do it with a unique twist which is every single dollar being spent whether it's nonprofit money public money and on public health money needs to be diverted from making these encampments nicer for people to live on the street and put it into bed space we have no attic bed space and we need to fine-tune the rules of engagement that are given for people ie we're paying a lot of money to give people narcan so that they can wake up a drug addict man I was talking about this been yesterday for two hours with somebody in media how the cops don't even want narcan anymore for that exact reason they're administering it they're showing back up an hour later for the same person I know paramedics in Philadelphia that have given people narcan twice in a shift because what you do is like giving a drunk a cup of coffee you're waking them up they ruin their high they go out to score more dope and then they overdose because the other dope is still in their system so why are we spending all this money to train people and give people narcan versus putting that money into the actual long-term treatment plans like you know Phoenix house in New York in Harlem which have been proven have the 60 70 percent success rate versus the 10 15 percent success rate involved with you know giving someone a 48 hour detox and setting them back right so are they what are they doing so you get him into a silly like that there's bed space hypothetically perfect world bed space they go through the detox they get today yet more comprehensive treatment what do you do with them after they're finished they're because they're so it's along a long-term treatment plan is you got your detox or 48 hours you've hit bottom then you have your your traditional 12-step recovery facility 28 days then you have what's called a long-term treatment house where you're basically in a group home like someone on parole you live there you pay rent there so it's you know zeroed out as far as cost public funding and you you know you basically are monitored and you have groups and you have 12-step meetings and they assure you get enough time between you and the street so that you don't end up going back out okay not bad I like that solution so when you talk about criminalizing addiction you're really not talking about it in the traditional sense you're essentially saying this is more be rather than saying criminalize this is more of a a strong civil commitment situation you try to get these people off drugs and keep them off you're not talking about just throwing them into prison yeah it's a civil and criminal combined solution so if you look at the platforms of Beth Grossman who lost to Larry Krasner Beth Grossman splat what we're talking about for the audience won't be familiar to it Philadelphia District Attorney's race correct yes the controversial one where the the the attorney blacks matter and occupy one the district attorney raised his platform basically stop criminalizing minor things we're not going to arrest him or charge them in the first place which leaves them on the street versus someone who's pro enforcement who says look they there's needs to be some kind of scheduled intervention in the first place so how do we intervene with them and then divert them into something that makes them better versus just kicking them out to Rikers or Holmesburg prison I make sense to me because all that jail is is crime school I always remember that scene and the Johnny Depp movie blow when he says that when he went to federal prison it was crime schooling for we teaching guys how to smuggle right and there's rum coming in there it's whatever you need well I love I love the solution it makes perfect sense what you're proposing what's the likelihood we'll ever see anything like it around the United States because these cities have a major major problem I surprisingly you started seeing it in places like New York first so there are some baby steps being taking place you're gonna see it in southern states first because they've already streamlined their criminal justice processing I think there can be a private side I think there's money in it I think if groups like Geo and some of the larger private you know contract groups start looking at treatment wings of their correctional facilities it can be a positive ROI versus simply correctional facilities people still because they're getting drugs in the jail so they're still addicted they're just coming out more hardened prison look it'll probably be for the big private prison contractors geo and some others that it'd probably be a hell of a lot more lucrative as well than just providing bed space themselves I want to bring you this important content every single day so help me do that by subscribing to our premium service at
