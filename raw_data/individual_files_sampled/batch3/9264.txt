CHINA, BRITAIN, FRANCE AND GERMANY, WHO ARE DISAPPOINTED IN THE PRESIDENT FOR THIS AND MAY NOT GO ALONG WITH WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. THEN WHAT? LET'S ASK GENERAL JERRY BOYKIN. THEY ARE CLAIMING, THE COSIGNATORIES ON THIS AGREEMENT, THEY ARE UPSET, AND THEY ARE NOT GOING ALONG. DO YOU BELIEVE THEM? I THINK I BELIEVE THEM IN THE SHORT TERM BUT THIS IS A STERLING EXAMPLE OF INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP. I'M PROUD OF OUR PRESIDENT FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE AND I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THE SAME THING AS WHEN HE SAID HE WILL MOVE THE EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. EVERYONE CAME BACK WITH A VERY NEGATIVE REACTION. BUT NOW YOU ARE SEEING INCREMENTALLY WON BY ONE OTHER COUNTRIES MAKING THE SAME DECISIONS. I THINK WE WILL SEE A SIMILAR THING IN THIS. Neil: ANOTHER THING THAT I SEE, AND THIS GOES BACK TO MY LITTLE DIRTY WORLD, IS A PRAGMATIC PATTERN. MORE PRAGMATIC THAN I THINK THE CRITICS OF THE PRESIDENTS HAVE GIVEN HIM. I THINK THAT IS THAT HE HAS A 90 DAY SORT OF COOLING. BEFORE IT WOULD REVERT BACK TO SOME OF THE SANCTIONS. THEN I WOULD ASSUME A NEW DEAL COULD BE HAD OR CONSTRUCTS OF ONE COULD BE HOW TO COME UP WHAT THINK? General Boykin: IT'S A 90-180 DAYS, WHICH I THINK IS A POSITIVE THING BECAUSE IT GIVES THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN PARTICULAR CHINA AND RUSSIA WILL DO THEIR OWN THINGS BUT I THINK THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE THE KEY HERE. I THINK THIS GIVES THEM TIME ENOUGH TO SAVE FACE AND TO NEGOTIATE IN SOME WAY, NOT ONLY WITH EACH OTHER BUT CERTAINLY WITH IRAN, TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT EITHER WOULD MAKE THIS DEAL MORE PALATABLE, OR, TO GET OUT OF IT ALTOGETHER THEMSELVES. Neil: GENERAL, I WONDER ABOUT THAT. SOME OF THE THINGS IRAN WANTED OUT OF THE DEAL, IT GOT. I GOT MONEY, PALLETS OF CASH SHIPPED TO THEM ON PRIVATE JETS. SAY NOTHING OF THE BILLIONS THAT WERE UNFROZEN AND HANDED BACK. SO YOU COULD MAKE THE CYNICAL POINT HERE THAT THEY ARE A LITTLE IN TO WANT THE IRANIANS TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE PRESIDENT, WHAT DO YOU THINK? General Boykin: I THINK THERE CERTAINLY IS AN INCENTIVE FOR THE IRANIANS IN THAT, WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IS THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE THE EUROPEANS. IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT THEY AMERICAN SLAPPED THE SANCTIONS ON THEM BUT THEY CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE THE EUROPEANS DO IT. EUROPEANS HAVE MADE HUGE INVESTMENTS SINCE THE DEAL WAS MADE IN 2015 AND THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE THOSE INVESTMENTS, THOSE BUSINESSES OR CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE ESTABLISHED BUSINESS WITH THE IRANIANS. I WOULD BE A SEVERE BLOW TO THEIR ECONOMY. Neil: WHILE I HAVE YOU, JOHN KERRY WAS APOPLECTIC ABOUT THIS, SPEAKING IN ITALY. MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE WAS WORKING AND THE SCENES, SOMETIMES NOT EVEN BEHIND THE SCENES, TO PUSH BACK AT THIS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? General Boykin: THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HIS LEGACY, AND HIS LEGACY WAS JUST DESTROYED WITH ONE DECISION BY OUR PRESIDENT. BUT STOP AND THINK ABOUT THIS. YOU NOW HAVE MIKE POMPEO ON THE WAY TO NORTH KOREA. DO YOU THINK MIKE POMPEO MIGHT BE GOING IN IN A BIG STRONGER POSITION THAN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF WE HAD STAYED IN THIS DEAL? I THINK SO. CARRIE WENT IN WITH NOTHING AND HE GOT NOTHING OUT OF IT. Shepard: THERE ARE SOME SAYING, SPEAKING OF THOSE NORTH KOREAN NEGOTIATIONS, AMERICANS CAN WILLY-NILLY TURN THEIR BACK ON DEALS HERE. AND I KNOW THIS WAS NOT A TREATY AND YOU AND I HAVE GOTTEN INTO THIS IN THE PAST. BUT MAYBE THE NORTH KOREANS WILL THINK, WHAT IF THEY ALL OF A SUDDEN CHANGE THEIR MIND WITH US? General Boykin: I DON'T SEE THAT BEING THE CASE. I SEE THAT AS KIM JONG RECOGNIZING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT GUY WITH A DIFFERENT AGENDA THAN OUR PREVIOUS PRESIDENT, AND I SEE HIM LOOKING AT THIS AS AN ISSUE AS STRENGTH AND LEADERSHIP ON OUR PART, OR AT LEAST ON THE PART OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
