the elections looming in Sweden right-wing support is gaining momentum that submit a spate of incidents in Swedish cities of gangs setting cars on fire almost 2,000 cars have been tossed across the country since January with a record reached this month when over a hundred cars were burned all vandalized in just a few hours Fraga most addictive ever found the question has to be asked to those people what the heck were you doing do you think you are born you destroyed the whole area for the neighbors for the children on their way to be pretty cool you have to see burns out cards of course they must be hard response from society me at associate RTS marathon oshina visited one such trouble district with the local journalist you've done directness Howland is one of these no-go souls for we go right now we're driving to the southern part of Stockholm the Swedish capital to one of the area's called by police as vulnerable area or especially vulnerable area or risk area how they refer to it but in the media very often they call these neighbourhoods there are right now around 61 of them officially listed by police as no-go zone and here with me is a Swedish journalist hang freak thank you so much for being my guide tonight no gum zone in Sweden seriously of course you can go there you will have problem if you go to with the camera or if you're a police for years Swedish vulnerable areas have been grabbing headlines over shooting and car burnings the latter has nearly doubled every 10 years why do they burn the cards I think it's like to show police that they're in control of the area not the police you know lots of people are angry you know because you know if you put what if you have a parking lot with 20 cars in a row and you put one car on fire of course it will spread to the next corner next car that people leave those areas yes as soon as they make some more money they move away immediately definitely you don't want your kids to go in the school here or anything spark the discussion is it true a lot if it's a no-go zone and as a politician on this a gimmick for example a social democrat he called it no it's a go-go so you know so he went out Holland I used to live there and visit with the police and everything yeah when I got out today I had of course punctured that I had of the police car so they had to call for what you call it yeah it's our truck to get away the police car we need here will start to prove it's a Go Go so known for high criminality rate the areas have also a reputation for drug trade here is one place where there's a lot of drugs we see the people up here you can literally just go out there to any of the people stand in here and ask for whatever they will provide it for you even if you're blind you will see what they are dealing drugs it's not like they are hiding it 50 people some have terribly ever traitors aren't violent like after go boys you know nothing to tell you know the average Mafia give me money no money okay what's that dish gone you mean what we've seen across Sweden's vulnerable areas looked quite tense just like the country's Prime Minister has described although the authorities never agreed many tend to blame the massive number of immigrants for the situation people think that it's related to this 2015 immigration crisis with no this is because of immigration we had 20 years ago a lot of these people are criminals or second-generation immigrants the parents came to speak if you want to be a bit dramatic you could say that the worst is still ahead of us some locals dubbed the troubled areas no-go zones but police claimed no such areas exist preferring to call them vulnerable areas they are characterized by high crime rates and social exclusion we spoke to Adrian Guapo a social scientist he says economic hardship among migrants is at the root of the problem I understand that it can look Hollywood karate because it is chaotic but we have a poverty not allowing certain migrants to get into the labor market so that's that's a big problem here we are in the beginning of a change of a political party the first time in history from being Social Democrats and getting into a very very alternative rights new kind of political situation here so so of course it's a little bit chaotic in that way you
