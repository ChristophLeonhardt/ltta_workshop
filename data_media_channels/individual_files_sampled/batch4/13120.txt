Hillary Clinton has declared victory in her fight to win the Democratic nomination for unscrupulous president in a speech made before a crowd of people hired to be her enthusiastic supporters mrs. Clinton said quote the nomination is mine mine mine mine mine mine all the power that I've dreamed of all these years is finally within my grasp I can almost feel it in my fingers like a red-hot flame waiting to scorch the flesh of my enemies those enemies who've tried to thwart me all these years let them tremble in terror now knowing that the power to destroy them with but a single word will soon be mine mine mine unquote as mrs. Clinton's supporters screamed and trampled each other trying to get to the exits the former Secretary of State's eyes glowed red and objects began to fly across the room and even burst into flame as the doors locked on their own blocking any chance of escape mrs. Clinton then continued her speech in spite of coughing up a gout of blood that stained the front of her dress red saying quote don't think for a moment I've forgotten even one of the people who tried to stand in my way whether it was ordinary voters or reporters or that squirrely little black guy who stole from me my rightful place in the Oval Office eight years ago I remember each and every one of them and each and every one will pay with suffering you cannot even begin to imagine nothing can stop me now nothing nothing the nomination is mine my mind unquote after the victory party mrs. Clinton stood in the smoldering rubble and told reporters she planned a quiet family celebration for later that evening during which she would mate with an unsuspecting male and then devour him former Vermont senator Bernie Sanders vowed to carry on his campaign to smother the American economy under a discredited and oppressive philosophy Sanders told his youthful idealistic enthusiastic and almost entirely ignorant supporters quote it's only basic fairness for the government to be able to take away a person's money and give it to someone else it's only basic fairness that the majority should be able to vote away the property rights of the minority it's only basic fairness that the people who have control of the army should be able to pillage the earnings of the productive or maybe basic fairness isn't the phrase I'm looking for never mind that now unquote Donald Trump meanwhile won 77% of the Republican vote in California or six votes speaking to a cheering crowd of white supremacists and anti-semites mr. Trump said quote no really I've been treated very unfairly in the Trump University case and I'm not saying it's just because the judge is a wetback I have many many wetback friends believe me and I don't mean just any beaners these are the best beaners in the world and they love me folks they love me unquote mr. Trump went on to say that he was being attacked by losers and haters and as far as he was concerned all the losers and haters could get the hell out whereupon his supporters went home leaving him to continue his defense of Trump University in an empty room trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show I love this election it's like I don't I don't even have to mix stuff up just I'm just writing it down folks just transcribing what I see in front of me so it's over but it's Yogi Berra was wrong it's it ain't over even when it's over Bernie Sanders is is fighting on so it goes on and on and the press is just oh we're gonna talk about all this but I also have to say it's mailbag day we're born bring forget about it forget about the election it's mailbag they're yeah and if you subscribe now for 30 days for free and then $7.99 and we send you a penny you send us 8 bucks we send you a penny in the mail every every month and you get to be in the next mail bags too late for this mail bag but we'll be back again if they haven't destroyed the country before that so all right so Hillary Clinton cleaned up she really did well she's she even did really well in California where there was some hope among those of us who like to see her humiliated and crushed even if she wins that she would be that you know that she would be tied or beaten in California but she did really well and the press of course has gone a woman crazy he's like you know it's the woman yeah yesterday it was embarrassing it was embarrassing the press was you know she hasn't given a press conference since I think it's 1987 was the last Prescott I mean she has not talked to the press at all and they're kind of nudging her politely about it the New York Times at an editorial today we're in that like the fifth paragraph or something there couldn't you please give a press conference a week we know you're making history as a woman but could you please you know just please say and we won't ask me anything hard please you know it so that's and they get out thank you for eight minutes yesterday and seriously the questions they're asking her I'm so proud you know literally the questions and there's you know yesterday I played that thing of that woman calling out and she wouldn't shut up and when she finally got his attention and she wouldn't stop finally got his attention she asked this incredibly stupid question about whether he's a sexist for running against a woman candidate for president she was from the New York Times like you know I thought like this has got to be some local goon who doesn't know what she's doing well I was right she's local but he's look of The Times Square's llaman shall soon door or something like this so what all this reminds me of is you know people say that our culture our artistic culture now is imitative and it's not doing anything new and that's it's entirely untrue it's just it's moved to different places like you know this game of Thrones has now reached a level of genius I mean all that all the people I wish I could talk about it but I don't want to spoil anything but all the religious people who were saying you you shouldn't watch it last week's game of Thrones had more to say about religion than any 10 works I have seen it was so brilliant on the subject of religion and so realistic and and difficult and something that to struggle with there's lots of lots of brilliant stuff video games are really intelligent ones but if we could have this thing called big culture in the same way you have like you know the Breitbart was always saying yeah you know Big Pharma and your big business yeah you could have a big culture big culture is empty big culture just continue it's not right it is not right that people of the ages of most of the people in this room should be going to movies about cartoon heroes who were invented in the 30s and 40s I mean you know like in the 70s we had Star Wars you know it was a new thing you know I mean and yeah it had a relationship to the old serials it was a take off in the old serios but it was actually a new thing now what they do is they make these things again and then they put a black guy or a woman in them and say oh look it's new it's ghostbusters but with a woman isn't that creative you know it's like it's mission impossible but you know they can ice or black you know it's all this is why this is why they're fighting over James Bond you know give us a female James Bond give us a you know a gay James but whatever there's whatever crazy stuff they're saying it's because they can't create anything that part of that part of big culture of shared culture because it came from a time when our culture was shared when we were all kind of unified and what we wanted in our viewpoint they can't make it anymore they can't make something that big so so instead they just put that's what Hillary Clinton reminds me of it's the same old crappy Democrat Party but with a woman it's like Ghostbusters with a woman it's it's Tammany Hall but it's a woman this time so it's really different you know it's the same thing we're gonna spend all your money and going deeper into debt but it's gonna be a woman you know it's like Barack Obama oh but he's doing it he's ruining the country but he's black you know and it's like watching Star Wars the same damn plot that you did in the 70s but it's a black guy and a girl you know so that's really really creative and different that is where the Democrat Party is and Hillary played it to the hilt in her victory speech she immediately went to the woman thing we've reached a milestone the first time in our nation's history that a woman will be a major parties it's not about one person it belongs to generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and made this moment possible in our country it started right here in New York a place called Seneca Falls in eighteen when a small but determined group of women and men came together with the idea that women deserved equal rights and they set it forth in something called the declaration of sentiments and it was the first time in human history that that kind of declaration occurred so we all owe so much to those who came before and tonight belongs to all of you here's my advice okay if you're not married and you want to get married get married now find a nice boy find a nice girl and get married now and I'll tell you why because remember when Barack Obama was elected it was going to be the end of racial strife remember how it was going to be you know the post-racial age we had lifted above this and instead here we are at each other's throats for no reason for no real reason because there is no institutional racism in this country anymore so it's like just this is just jimang up you know an idea of injustice and idea that people are being treated unfairly if Hillary is elected women and men are going to be fighting in the streets like hand to hand the hatred once they start in like you can't say that she's a woman you can't criticize her her mistake she's only once they start that it's like you are going to be ripping your girlfriend's head off so marry her now because that's gonna be so ticked off at her eight years or four years from now that you're not even not even to be able to talk to you anymore sort of merit get married now alright so then she goes after Trump let's hear on on the Donald Donald Trump is temper mentally unfit to be President not just trying to build a wall between America and Mexico he's trying to wall off Americans from each other when he says let's make America great again that is code for let's take America backwards back to a time when opportunity and dignity were reserved for some not all promising his supporters an economy he cannot recreate it's clear that Donald Trump doesn't believe we are stronger together he has abused his primary opponents and their families attacked the press for asking tough questions denigrated Muslims and immigrants he wants to win by stoking fear and rubbing salt in wounds and reminding us daily just how great he is you know I think not to defend Donald Trump but it is unfair of accusing of speaking in code because if Donald Trump wanted to take America backwards what he would say is let's make a map where a big red half the second take America backwards it's not like the guy has a break on his mouth so the funny thing is is she's running on hope and not change basically she's just let's not change anything everything is everybody is so angry that a huge number of numbers of her party voted for you know Doc Brown from Back to the Future who wants to take them to socialism which we know is failed everywhere it's even failed in the places he would talk about you know in Norway in places like that it's all gone south it's just ruined everything it's made people slaves and in a country like this that needs a is so deeply in debt that it needs a incredible insanely dynamic economy just to pay the interest on our loans you know is it but they went after him because they hate her they hate what's happening they hate this country and you know the Donald and and Sanders are just a symbol of that and and she's saying basically you know don't let's not change anything you know go with me on this on the safe choice so Trump hits back we what is this new Trump number one on Hillary the twins have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves they've made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access selling favors selling government contracts and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server something that how she's getting away with us folks nobody understands designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record putting the security of the entire country at risk and a president in a corrupt system is totally protecting her not right Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund the Russians the Saudis the Chinese all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return it's a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens you know the country screwed but it is gonna be fun I mean each other's heads off and you know they're both right I mean that's the wonderful thing you know you doesn't have the temperament to be President and she's a crook you know so it's like this is gonna be history we have nominated the two worst people in America how could we I mean where would we have gone you know Little Italy there's that old club where I used to see I used to work down there used to see John Gotti the mob boss that's the only place we could have gone to get somebody worse you know it's like you over there you killed but you know you while your attorney tearing the head off parking meters you know could come over and be President we got these guys so that was Trump by the way being the new man that was you know Trump has been accused of not moving into the second act after all you know think about it for a minute the guy got 40% of the Republican of the people who turnout for Republican primaries so very very committed Republican voters or whatever they were you know turned out and he got 40% of them and it was definitely a triumph over you know 17 16 other people whatever it was but but that's now he's got to get the whole country now the whole country is paying attention and now they're watching him and so this is the Donald reading off the teleprompter and being sophisticated and promising you that he's not gonna mess up I mean this is the Trump number two he's gonna tell you he's gonna do this right I understand the responsibility of carrying the metal and I will never ever let you down too much work too many people blood sweat and tears never gonna let you down I will make you proud of your party and our movement and that's what it is is a movement you know it's funny I was watching Fox a little bit last night and they had at one of those meaningless focus groups and basically the people don't like this this Trump they want the Trump to blow things up who blow stuff up that's what they do that's what they hired him for they didn't hire him to be this responsible guy the problem is the problem is is like people you know everybody attacks politicians for what they do but politicians are good at one thing they're good at being politicians you know professional writers are good at being professional writers dancers are usually pretty good at being dancers you know you don't get to work in in the dancing business if you can't dance politicians are generally good at being politicians and there's a reason they do things the way they do them even if it's frustrating Trump has changed that he has rewritten the rulebook but at some point at some point he's gonna have to find some way to communicate to more people to people who you know who don't think it's a good idea to call a judge to call out a judgement being Mexican when he was born in India actually I don't know how to break this to Trump but that actually makes you a Hoosier not a Mexican you know this is not you know England where you go you live there for ten generations but you came from Italy so you're an Italian this is America wait two minutes off after you're off the boat you're an American welcome home you know it works here and he's gonna have to sign on to that and it you know the the sight of guys like Paul Ryan and everybody running for cover was really embarrassing you know it's like it's it's conservatives we're attacking them and saying well you know you signed on and now you're stuck with this and the Wall Street Journal is upset is upset that people were yelling at Paul Ryan for running for cover not for running for cover but first endorsing Trump then running for cover first saying he would vote for Trump and then running for cover so the Wall Street Journal writes an editorial today goes like this the impulse of some conservatives for self-destruction this year seems to have no limits many of the same people who paved the way for Donald Trump are now trying to X commute communicate from polite conservative company the men in the best position to minimize the presumptive GOP presidential nominees damaged that's the only way to read the conservative journalists who are joining Democrats in denouncing House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for saying they would vote for mr. Trump I'll beat without embracing his rhetoric or all of his agenda this has offended various Beltway Grandy's who are lecturing the two leaders that they have besmirched their good name and for all time we can understand why the left takes this line but why is the right doing it basically well they you know he says the question is why would conservatives play along it's a simple question it's a simple question it's not strategy it's it's about the politics is a big picture game politics is a big picture game you know you see these things you can't this is why conservatives have such a hard time the Democrats come out say we're gonna give you stuff you know that's big-picture conservatives come out with a chart and say well you know if you're free you know the risks are bad worse and you might be out of work by the overtime and oh they watch this graph here you know and it's like we're out no Ally you know I was like don't let the door hit you on the way out when you endorse Donald Trump you get the whole thing and when he starts in on Mexicans and women can't be judges and Muslims can't be judges you know you get all of that and that's the electorate you know you can't go and and it's all so ugly it's he's wrong he's wrong to say it you know it now turns out I didn't realize this that he had made a mistake with this judge this is curiel in the in the Trump University case he had made a mistake that this judge belonged to a legal organization with the name La Raza and he thought that that was the racist Mexican organization let me just got it wrong but when you watch people time I've been watching Bill O'Reilly kind himself in knots - you know justify these comments and it reminds me of the Laocoon do you know the Laocoon is the famous have a picture of it you can if they put it in there you can put it up it's it's the famous statue of the Trojan priest it's in the Vatican his sons being killed by these tangled up by the snake this is the priest who said beware of Greeks bearing gifts when the Greeks brought the Trojan horse and the God sent these snakes to kill him and his kid kids and this tangle that they're getting themselves in you know it's not you're not gonna be able to get out of it and that's why we're picking on them we're not picking on Paul Ryan for an for saying he'd vote for Trump and then trying to duck the racism because we don't like him or because certainly I like him but he has gotten himself in the situation and this is what Trump comes along with and we might as well acknowledge that it is because we're gonna have to somehow sell you know sell keep the keep hold of the House of Representatives and the Senate while this guy basically gives us a bad name all right we're gonna come back on this we're gonna do the mailbag because I always never leave enough time for the mailbag so let's see the mailbag here's I'm not sure if this is pinchos or pinkos like maybe it's a Jewish name like Pincus or something like that he says hey Andrew love your show contrary to popular belief I think you laughing at your own jokes hysterical I'm glad I'm glad to hear that there's somebody out there I get so much grief over this all right my question is aside from your own what modern-day novels would you recommend and the answer is not that many I mean there's only a few I'm not gonna go into too many of them because I want to save them for stuff I like but the only author I actually actually will go to the book store waiting for her new book is Donna Tartt right now before that it was Patrick O'Brian and if you haven't read the C stories a Patrick O'Brien you gotta read them they are they have some of their works of art and he died I don't know about ten years ago something like that but Donna Tartt wrote the secret history so read the secret history that's her first novel her latest novel won the Pulitzer Prize but that first novel is really readable and good she's a terrific novels really talented really she's I don't think she's done anything quite great yet but that's a high bar and she's really terrific all right from Mike professor Clavin yeah I got element I got a degree this is great could you please weigh in about the brock turner case that has been flooding the airwaves this is the case of that former Stanford athlete who had sex with a woman who had passed out and he was convicted of three felony counts and the judge in this very very light sentence of six months saying he didn't want to ruin his life good question all right I will I will tell and so everybody has taken a different thing brach the guy who did the who had sex with the girl he says this is it's a problem of the culture of drinking and promiscuity on campus the woman says hey you know you raped me you ruined my life and of course the press is on all this rape culture not you know they're just babbling nonsense here's here's my take on this you have sex with an unconscious woman that's rape okay I can understand that's it's rape I mean that's what it is and I can understand a judge saying well he's a young guy he's never done anything wrong before I'm gonna give him a light sentence a light sentence for rapists three years I think he got six months and three years probation in California I think he gets it's three five and eight years you know if he had said you're going away for three years that's a horrible horrible thing to happen to a kid like that you know and I and I think that would have been punishment it still would have been - damn what but but you know I would have understood that giving him six months is a travesty that's ridiculous he raped that girl now is there anything else to say about that of course there is of course there is you know I had a friend a long time ago who went into a subway in the worst time in New York crime went to a subway at like one o'clock in the morning and he got mugged was it his fault he got mugged of course not it's the muggers walls they got mugged if they get arrested they should go away for for mugging him was he being wise to go down into a subway in a high crime area at one o'clock in the morning no he wasn't it's not his fault but he wasn't being watched this this culture of prompt of drinking promiscuity on campus is guaranteed to leave women in the lurch and it is the fault of feminism you know I I attack feminism all the time but it's not because I don't want women to do whatever they want I want women to do everything each woman to do whatever makes her happy that's what I want you know that's that's that's the whole thing what I hate about feminism is that it's a lie it tells you that women and men want the same thing in general in general they do not and I think that women who drink like that and have promiscuous sex and then wake up and feel like crap you know this this didn't happen this woman she just passed out but it's just going to cause that situation to happen again and again I think needs to be crushed and I think it needs to be crushed without hurting women's rights and women's freedoms which I'm all for but those two things are at odds feminism elevates men's values you know I always think of that Rosie the Riveter making a muscle any that's that's a woman doing something that any man can do better you know let's you know you know so it's like it's like they elevate men's values and tell women that they have to live up to that and one of men's values is all I really scored last night and women you know that makes most women obviously they're exceptions what makes most women really unhappy so the individual story is this guy committed rape he should have been slammed for it he should have gotten you know the the book thrown at him that has nothing to do with the fact that the culture is really screwed up in its feminism's fault from Brian okay what happened to the cardboard sign where is the cardboard sign I don't know the answer this question Oh Jay you know the producers stole my cardboard sign that's though just shows you the level of respect that I get around here from Ricardo what why do you think video I love the cardboard sign too but put back my cardboard sign you all right why do you think videogames were better at resisting a cultural takeover by the left when compared to Hollywood and comics also uncharted 4 is fantastic let me tell you I spent so much time oh the lovely Lindsay is going to put back so not only do you get to see the car boy son you get to see the lovely Lindsay which by the way many people have written it now see now nobody's paying attention to me anymore no that's all I'm gonna get Lindsay all I'm gonna get her letters could she do that again please all right so first of all video games were a culture unto themselves which was one of the reasons they were out of the mainstream you know even though they are a bigger business now than Hollywood movies they are not the business of the elite so the elite wasn't paying attention to them they thought that were four kids they didn't realize that grown-ups were playing him so when the feminists attacked and they fought back they actually took the mainstream media by surprise and mainstream media was completely taken off-guard and that's one of the reasons they could fight back and also you know there they are a bit of a nerdy subculture and they just didn't want to take it and they didn't take it and they if we think the rest of the culture too same thing we would win too because these people are wrong and it's easy to defeat them if you stand up and you're not afraid Uncharted force I wasted so much of my life this weekend playing uncharted 4 you know it usually takes me months because I don't have any time to play video games I'm half more than halfway through it really really a good game all right let's see here I want there's one from Matthew he asked will conservatism have to change to accommodate Millennials he says so many Millennials have been taken in by socialism will conservative has to change yes conservative conservatism has to start changing right now okay because we have failed that the elevation of Donald Trump to the head of the Republican Party and the elevation of Hillary Clinton to follow up Barack Obama is a failure of conservatism to sell its case and the reason for this is because we are not addressing the culture as it is too much conservatism is conservative in the bad sense the wonderful thing about American conservatism is it is not european conservatives european conservatism is trying to maintain a world that is no more you know a world of privilege a world of class a world of you know bigotry war you know royalty we never were doing that here conservatism here is preserving tenants of freedom and individualism and small limited government we can't have a small government anymore the country is too big but limited government what has fallen apart is the consensus the moral consensus that made that freedom more easy to maintain because if people are going to church if people are saying married of people having children in wedlock then it is easy to govern them with a light hand but people start having children out of wedlock when they start taking methods that are going to church when you know you know as something like 40% of children are born out of wedlock now it used to be 4% and don't tell me that that doesn't matter because the the problems that come along with single parenthood and with children being born out of wedlock are legion their unhappiness more suicide more imprisonment more crime it is a genuine problem so so we have to address a culture that is fragmented and you can't address a culture that is fragmented by shaking your fist to saying go back to church that's not what's going to happen you know what has happened is not the people who were religious are still religious we haven't we haven't gotten less religious what's happened is the people we're just saying they were religious because the culture reinforced that they've drifted away they are now empowered and emboldened to say I'm not religious anymore if you want to sell those people religion you have to sell them the joys of religion not just you know go to church and and don't cheat on your wife or don't sleep around you know we have to understand that people gay people are not going back into the closet you know that's not happening people are going to be different things they're going to have different ways of relating different there's going to be an atomized culture for a long long time and conservatism has to address that we cannot be any more this one-size-fits-all conservatism I'm not saying to give up your cultural mores I'm not saying to give up your morals I'm saying that you have to if you're going to sell them you have to live by them and sell them through choice through the joy that you have and living the way you live and and conservatism itself as a political movement is going to have to become more libertarian and I don't mean libertarian in that wonky horrible way where all you do is sit around and talk about how marijuana should be legal I mean libertarian in that it addresses an atomized culture a culture that has dissipated into intense individualism and isn't changing back anytime soon and the guys who tell me that we can't survive that you know they may be right they may be right but giving up will ensure that they're right instead we have to reshape and reform conservatism to address that atomized individualistic culture I believe it can be done but I don't believe it's gonna be easy and it may well fail but it has to be tried all right I'm out of time again - we should just do the entire like week of mail bag stuff lots of stuff hey thank you for all the people who wrote in and said that you had pre-ordered my book the great good thing my memoir the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ I hope other people will pre-order it and take a look at it I'm getting really nice reactions from people I've been able to send out some you know advanced readers copies and the people are reading it or really liking it and I think you will like it so if you like the show so go out and preorder it which is helpful to me stuff I like we've been doing John McCrae here's one nobody knows development but me this is really really obscure before liquor a became the great Cold War spy writer he wrote two mystery stories that were just mystery novels but they starred they George Smiley who later became the hero of his big trilogy Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley's people and so he just wrote Smiley's kind of a detective but they were complex interesting mystery stories one of them was called call for the dead and it was made into a movie called deadly affair which is it's old you know it's I think it's from the 60s it's directed by Sidney Lumet that great director he directed 12 Angry Men Dog Day Afternoon Network the verdict he was nominated for Academy Awards again and again they start James Mason as I think he's the smiley character that I'm not sure they call him smiley in it it's a really really tough hard-boiled mystery story that opens with them just doing a security check on a guy who used to be a communist in his youth but he's now you know he's now seen the light and they just go and check on him to make sure that he's secure and can be given a government job and from that everything just unravels and it's a hard-boiled and mean and tough and it's a really really good movie the deadly affair based on call for the dead by John Locke Ray that's it well folks it looks like you know we it doesn't look like we're gonna wake up from this it doesn't in the Wall Street Journal they said you know Donald Trump the delegates may still revolt and throw Donald Trump out I'm thinking oh here we are you know it's looking like Donald and Hillary so let's let's try and be entertained and rebuild there in in the background as we go down this Mary Mary path I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show will be back to seal off the week on Thursday tomorrow be there thank you
