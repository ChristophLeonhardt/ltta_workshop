Stephen Lawrence was murdered because he was black stabbed by a group of white thugs in an unprovoked racist attack in justice watershed landmark are all used to describe the Lawrence case Stephens father told me that he had everything going for him Steve was a human being he didn't see color he didn't look on people and judge their money was helpful you know would help anybody and you know for somebody to actually kill my son I still can't understand such a humble person so what reason would you have to kill somebody like that Stephens murder changed Britain's legal and policing landscape forever the failure to bring his killers to justice was a stain on the country's legal system for years within days of Stephens murder the police were given the names of the five suspects but they failed to act and their subsequent botched investigation led the police to be accused of institutional racism that was the judgment of an inquiry ordered by the government after Stephens death when the five suspects appeared there was chaos the report found that Stephens race had affected the way the case was handled it made 70 recommendations saying police attitudes towards racism had to improve and that the race relations act needed to be strengthened to put an end to discrimination it also ordered targets for the recruitment retention a promotion of black and Asian officers the most damning part of the report though was the claim that the police were institutionally racist I think it was fair back then and I think it's fair in the here and now and because one of the things that people will look at are is that have we progressed as policing moved on and even though there has been some progress it has been slow the Metropolitan Police says it is not the organization it was at the time of Stephen Lawrence is killing it would take nearly 19 years for two men to be found guilty of Stephens murder these people killed my son and made him into a legend and they have destroyed their lives Stephen Lawrence would now be 43 Neville Lawrence says he's forgiven his son's killers but the justice will not be done until all those involved in his son's murder are behind bars Emma Heywood al-jazeera in London
