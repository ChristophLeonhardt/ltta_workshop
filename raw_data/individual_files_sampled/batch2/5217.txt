the CPAC summit was the source of controversy as critics of the Trump administration were taken to task veteran conservative writer and policy advocate Mona Sharon had to be escorted out under the protection of security guards for her comments take a listen I'm actually gonna twist this around a bit and say that I'm disappointed in people on our side okay for being hypocrites about sexual or harasses and abusers of women or in our party who are sitting in the White House who brag about their extramarital affairs who brag about mistreating women and because he happens to have an AR after his name we we look the other way we don't complain this is this is a party that was ready to endorse the Republican party endorsed Roy Moore for the Senate in the state of Alabama even though he was a credibly accused child molester you cannot claim that you stand for women there was quite an interesting person quite an interesting person who was on this stage the other day her name is Marion lepen now why was she here why was she here she's a young no longer in office politician from France I think the only reason she was here is because she's named lepen and lepen name is a disgrace her grandfather is a racist and a Nazi she claims that she stands for him and the fact that CPAC invited her is a disgrace you know I I will take good news wherever I can get it first of all I so many conservatives thrilled by what none has said but also I actually heard some applause in the audience when she said the truth which was lepen was a Nazi with us now from Capitol Hill syndicated columnist and senior fellow at ethics and Public Policy Center Mama Sharon's art mana by saying that William F Buckley and I don't know Bob Novak and a lot of people are smiling in the heaven right now that was my - thank God I was gonna say it was extraordinary actually I know it took a lot of courage but you just told the truth talk about talk about the reaction and the security guards that came up to hustle you offstage look so many conservatives feel the way I do about this administration feel that this the association of trumpism with conservatism is a complete mistake that we this is not what conservatism stands for and so I just wanted to say that simple truth just say that I know when I hear other people say it it gives me courage it gives me reassurance so I decided to just say it now regarding the reaction as your there was some applause in the room and but when I when I left the stage I was surrounded by quite a few security guards and I thought at first that it was a joke I thought you can't be serious but they were very serious and you know I said look I they said have you made your arrangements for your transportation and I said well I was just gonna over home and they said well have you called the uber and it was all very intense and I said you know I left my coat in the green room and they sort of talked into their sleeves and said she left her coat in the green room you know going to the green room but look nobody approached me who was not friendly as we were leaving the convention center a couple of people with CPAC lanyards around their necks even gave me the thumbs-up so you never know what will happen when you speak up what it has to be not only disconcerting for you it just has to be depressing when you see people that you have known and I have known for years well and I'll just say like Matt slap who will work for George W Bush at a high position and then you see Michael Steele being attacked because he's black we should have never picked him as our chairman because he was black and then Matt seems to justify that by saying but Michael you've been critical of Donald Trump what do you expect how yeah how do we respond to that there's a there is a tone of sort of sophomoric clownish thats creeped into conservatism now last year CPAC invited milo to be their speaker and then at the last minute they had to withdraw the invitation reasons I won't go into but there is this this ethic this this mood of trolling the opposition that if you can create liberal tears then anything goes and even to the point of inviting the granddaughter of jean-marie Le Pen and a Nazi and anti-semite from France and what was the point of inviting her it was again to create a response to to jab a needle in the eye of liberals and they think this is a game there's not mama it's not a games what's so fascinating it before not only was her grandfather a Nazi and she said she embraces all of his positions her positions are distinctly liberal with where the I guess you'd say with a big al the National Front wants to nationalize industry they want to have national health care they want to reduce work hour weeks in France require only 30 hour work weeks which is like the worst thing in the rain for France but Joe you're you're assuming that concert' that this wing of what is being called conservatism cares about those true issues of the size and scope of government they don't care about that what gets their blood going is immigration and that is why it was so contemptible that President Trump read that snake poem and said this applies to all immigrants all immigrants you know I was reflecting that you know he pointed out that the truck bomber that the guy who killed people in New York City driving a truck who had been an immigrant and he made him stand in for all immigrants and I thought he no more represents immigrants then the shooter at Parkland High School represents all gun owners right so I just wondering because there's seem to be some discomfort on the set that you were sitting on on stage and you could hear people booing what has happened how has it gotten to the point what you were speaking some pretty basic truths I don't understand why this has become so hard well there there are fewer and fewer people who are speaking up even I was getting depressed and demoralized and and feeling that what was the point after all and but since I said what I did there's been such an outpouring of support that I feel more than ever that people who are who adhere to basic principles of dignity and integrity and a belief that we should stand up for honesty there are a lot of them out there and and they just need a little encouragement I think you know and what's so interesting Jim is the real booing started when she brought up raw war isn't it yeah that's true if you go back and listen what really was was like yeah yes she crossed the Rubicon when she actually went after really more well and what brings all these stories together whether it's immigration or CPAC and especially for Republican viewers is that the world is changing this isn't 1950s America if you just look at it politically and practically the population of white America is on the decline you have a rise in the number of Hispanic voters each and every election and so if you don't diversify if you don't become something other than the mostly white party it doesn't work long-term and then practically for businesses and for this country if you're not getting immigrants who can who know technology who understand artificial intelligence look what China's doing China if they eat our lunch on artificial intelligence and I keep expanding with our week into Latin America which are doing Africa which they're doing in eastern Asia which they're doing it puts us at a massive competitive disadvantage so this isn't just a short-term pound your chest political issue it has long-term consequences for the economy and for I would say for the Republican Party and you know mana I remember talking the George W Bush in 1998 and in 1998 George Bush 20 years ago was saying this the Hispanic population is growing in a way that demands that we reach out to Hispanics more aggressively and we get Hispanics voting for us and what did Bush get I Can Has reelect he got like forty four forty five percent of the Hispanic vote it seems that Donald Trump stinking and everybody else in CPAC thinks that they're running in nineteen fifty two America look I think it is perfectly fair to have a debate about immigration I think people who believe that we need to take a pause or who believe that we're not assimilating immigrants as well as we could they have a good case to make and they deserve to be heard but to treat it as a matter of crime which is a complete falsehood immigrants are much less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans to treat it as a matter of xenophobia it is just morally wrong I don't think it's wrong to have a have a civilized debate about immigration as long as you don't demonize people in it thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to
