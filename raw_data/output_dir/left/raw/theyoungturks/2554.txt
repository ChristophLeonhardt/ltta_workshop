1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,489
DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS
SUCCEEDED IN PASSING TAX

2
00:00:03,489 --> 00:00:06,799
CUTS BUT THOSE TAX CUTS DO COST
QUITE A BIT AND THEY HAVE

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,049
TO MAKE UP FOR THE HUGE BREAK
THAT THE WEALTHY AND

4
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:15,280
CORPORATIONS ARE GETTING THROUGH
THIS NEW TAX LAW.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,619
ONE WAY THAT THEY HAVE DONE IT
IS THEY HAVE GOTTEN RID OF

6
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:19,730
CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,730
ALIMONY WAS SOMETHING THAT
PEOPLE WHO HAD JUST GOTTEN A

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,170
DIVORCE COULD DEDUCT FROM THEIR
TAXES BUT LITTLE KNOWN FACT IS

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,750
THAT THIS NEW TAX PLAN ACTUALLY
GETS RID OF THAT DEDUCTION AND

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,470
IT IS GOING TO LEAD TO
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS FOR

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,280
DIVORCING COUPLES, WHICH IS WHY
RIGHT NOW DIVORCE LAWYERS ARE

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,270
URGING PEOPLE TO GET THROUGH
THEIR DIVORCE AS SOON AS

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:52,550
POSSIBLE BEFORE THIS PORTION OF
THE LAW KICKS IN 

14
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,550
IN 2019.

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,240
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,190
SO THEY GET TO DEDUCT A PORTION
OF IT, MEANING THAT THEY

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,780
DON'T ACTUALLY SPEND THE ENTIRE
AMOUNT ON ALIMONY.

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,620
ALSO, PREVIOUSLY THE INDIVIDUAL
RECEIVING THE ALIMONY

19
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,240
PAYMENTS WOULD HAVE TO PAY TAXES
ON THAT INCOME.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,380
UNDER THIS NEW TAX PLAN, NO,
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WHICH IS

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:27,160
REALLY STRANGE.

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,260
BUT THAT IS EARNED INCOME.

23
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,280
WHY WOULDN'T YOU GET TAXED ON IT
BUT THE PERSON WHO IS GIVING IT

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,951
TO YOU DOESN'T GET TO USE THAT
MONEY, THEY GIVE IT RIGHT TO THE

25
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:40,100
OTHER PERSON BUT THEY GET TAXED
ON IT.

26
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,800
IT'S WEIRD AND ONE OF THE
THINGS, I THINK IT MAKES SENSE

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,650
TO DEDUCT IT AND THE REASON FOR
THAT IS YOU DO ACTUALLY HAVE TO

28
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,170
PAY IT AND ONCE YOU PAY IT THAT
IS MONEY YOU DO NOT HAVE

29
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,940
ENHANCED LESS MONEY YOU MADE
THAT YEAR IN A SENSE BUT NOW

30
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,990
THEY ARE SAYING NO, YOU ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO DEDUCT IT SOLD

31
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,880
COURSE YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN.

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,870
THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE WILL
OFFER LESSON IN ALIMONY.

33
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,008
IF THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE
ACTUALLY PAYING $.60

34
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:10,589
ON THE DOLLAR THEY CAN AFFORD TO
OFFER MORE.

35
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,450
THAT IS WHAT DIFFERENT DIVORCE
LAWYERS ARE PANICKING RIGHT NOW.

36
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,840
YOU CAN SAY NO BIG DEAL, THAT IS
JUST WHAT IS HAPPENING AND

37
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,670
IT'S OUR JOB TO REPORT IT AND IT
WILL CERTAINLY AFFECT THOSE

38
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,640
ALIMONY PAYMENTS AND YES, NOW
PEOPLE WILL PAY LESS

39
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,380
BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.

40
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,650
TO ME THERE IS A BIGGER ISSUE
ABOUT TEXAS OVERALL THAT WE

41
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,680
WILL GET TO IN A SECOND BUT I
WANT TO CONVEY TO YOU THE

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,770
SENSE OF PANIC WHICH I'M
SLIGHTLY AMUSED BY.

43
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,470
THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE AMERICAN
BAR ASSOCIATION SECTION ON

44
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,470
FAMILY

45
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:47,319
LIFE SAYS:

46
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,740
I LOVE THE QUOTES IN THE
ARTICLE, BUT ALSO, I LEARNED SO

47
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:56,310
MUCH ABOUT DIVORCES THAT I DID
NOT LOOK INTO EVER AND, IT

48
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,000
DOESN'T MATTER, I'M SURE IT WILL
NEVER AFFECT ME.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,110
CALIFORNIA.

50
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,050
CALIFORNIA HAS TO CHILL OUT WITH
ALL THIS DIVORCE STUFF.

51
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,890
DID YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA YOU
CANNOT GET DIVORCED WITHIN

52
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,410
A WEEK OR A MONTH?

53
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,190
THERE'S LIKE A SIX-MONTH
PERIOD THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT

54
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,120
BEFORE YOUR ARE FINALLY
OFFICIALLY DIVORCED.

55
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,010
IT'S CALLED A COOLING-OFF
PHASE.

56
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,090
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

57
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,270
AND THERE ARE COOLING-OFF
PERIODS IN

58
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,510
OTHER STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA
WHERE IS ACTUALLY LONGER,

59
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,310
YOU HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR.

60
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,090
THAT IS WHY DIVORCE LAWYERS ARE
PANICKING NOW,

61
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,190
ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE
THERE ARE SOME HIGH DOLLAR

62
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,550
DIVORCES AND THEY ARE LIKELY,
YOU DO NOT GET IT, YOU HAVE TO

63
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,560
SAY YOU'RE GETTING DIVORCED, THE
OTHER SIDE HAS TO AGREE, THERE

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,060
ARE ALL THESE THINGS AND THEN
YOU HAVE TO WAIT SIX MONTHS.

65
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,170
THEY'RE TELLING ALL OF THEIR
CLIENTS, IF YOU ARE

66
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,110
SLIGHTLY UPSET IN YOUR
MARRIAGE, GET DIVORCED NOW.

67
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,110
IT IS KIND OF CRAZY.

68
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,120
BY THE WAY, PARTY OF FAMILY
VALUES.

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,590
SO NOW THE LARGER POINT ABOUT
TAXES OVERALL.

70
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,590
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

71
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,090
THEY ARE GIVING A GIANT TAX CUT
TO CORPORATIONS.

72
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,780
THEY HAVE TO GET IT FROM
SOMEWHERE.

73
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,700
WHEN A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN
WAS ASKED ON TELEVISION CAN

74
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,719
YOU NAME ONE CORPORATE LOOPHOLE
THAT YOU GUYS TOOK AWAY?

75
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:21,209
HE COULDN'T NAME ONE.

76
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,720
WHEN IT COMES TO LOOPHOLES FOR
YOU GUYS OR I WOULD ARGUE,

77
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,050
IT'S NOT A LOOPHOLE, LOGICAL
DEDUCTION, NO, FOR THE

78
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,870
REGULAR PERSON WE'RE TAKING IT
AWAY SO THEY HAD TO GET THE

79
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,870
MONEY FROM SOMEWHERE.

80
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,080
THEY STILL HAVE ONE AND A HALF
TRILLION DOLLAR EXTRA

81
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,569
DEFICIT THAT THEY CREATED BUT
LIKE I TOLD YOU, THAT IS

82
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,120
NOT THE ONLY MONEY.

83
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,309
THE REALITY OF THE TAX CUTS FOR
THE RICH AND CORPORATIONS,

84
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:49,599
IT'S ABOUT 6 TRILLION SO THE
OTHER FOR NATURALLY HAD TO

85
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:52,590
COME FROM SOMEWHERE AND WHERE
DOES IT COME FROM?

86
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,590
YOU.

87
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,539
THEY TOOK AWAY YOUR DEDUCTIONS
BUT TOOK AWAY NONE OF THE

88
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,760
LOOPHOLES FOR CORPORATIONS THAT
WHEN A PERSON IS ABOUT TAX

89
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,289
REFORM THEY SAID IT IS NOT A TAX
CUT, TAX REFORM.

90
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:06,520
WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF THE
LOOPHOLE SO CORPORATIONS

91
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,830
CANNOT SHEET AND THEN LOWER
THEIR RATES.

92
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,869
AND ALSO KEEP IN MIND HOW
THEY SELL THE WAY THAT THEY

93
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:14,580
GOT RID OF ALL OF THESE
DEDUCTIONS.

94
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,789
WE ARE TRYING TO SIMPLIFY THE
TAX CODE, IT IS TOO

95
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:20,090
COMPLICATED TO GIVE THE MIDDLE
COUNT CLASS AND THE WORKING

96
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,629
CLASS ANY DEDUCTIONS.

97
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,589
THE CORPORATIONS CAN KEEP
THEIR DEDUCTIONS AND THEIR

98
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:28,639
LOOPHOLES, THAT IS NOT LOOP
COMPLICATED.

99
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,869
THE DUTCH SANDWICH AND IRISH
DOUBLE, WHATEVER THEY ARE

100
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:36,590
CALLED, THERE THESE CRAZY TAX
LOOPHOLES, THEY ALL STILL EXIST.

101
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,120
THEY ARE NORMATIVELY, LOCATED,
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO CREATE

102
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,289
THE JOBS.

103
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:41,509
HIGH-PAYING JOBS.

104
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,509
SURE.

105
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,669
BY THE WAY, HOW IS THAT MARKET
WORKING OUT FOR YOU GUYS?

106
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:58,419
TRUMP IS NOT BRAGGING ABOUT THE
STOCK MARKET TODAY, IS HE?

107
00:05:58,419 --> 00:00:00,000
OOPS.
