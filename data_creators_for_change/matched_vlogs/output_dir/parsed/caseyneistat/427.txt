I think we're coming into port now hotel
now there was an incident on the boat
trying to land the drone on a moving
boat and Dan went to catch it and the
throne dipped and the pond right into
his forearm so that fun boat adventure
kind of ended in turmoil
how much time before the wedding the
wedding is in one hour
first a tour of this hotel room this is
the bed there's a couch this is the TV I
unplugged it cuz I don't like to watch
TV on vacation or ever the mini-fridge
coffeemaker
yes outdoor seating situation super long
hallway closet six pretties and her room
for doing the unspeakable outdoor dining
table
cute little bird outdoor dated round one
round two
door shower and a private pool I thought
when she said don't bring shoes what she
meant was
don't bring any shit don't bring any
shoes because it's like a beach wedding
and we're gonna wear like flip-flops or
barefoot these are the only shoes I have
I see you brought shoes you look nice
thanks dad the guy whose are my last
grade earlier today
well my parachutes problem solved
no big deal
all right the wedding starts in
your wedding starts in four minutes
or minutes cocktail hour stir
telling me it's a bird that tells your
fortune my fortune last night it would
have been like KC's gonna take a drone
and cut your arm off well I had to put
this one on because it was bleeding
through through my white shirt
Courtney who's the bride is a wedding
planner
what that's why this wedding is so much
is so ridiculously perfect
so are you on tour right now you took
the time off to come here to Portland on
this ban is ridiculous
look everywhere over the wedding's
taking a crazy turn right now with fire
dancers and what else suspect there's
like two more locations after this going
back to my room which is far so taking
this golf cart
all right I think that's it I'm changed
I'm going back down there I'm gonna
dance I'm gonna leave this camera behind
because this is probably the best
wedding I've ever been to and I got to
give it all my focus huge
congratulations John and Courtney thanks
for having us
