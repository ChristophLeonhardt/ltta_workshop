I've been drinking since 6:00 in the morning that could describe most days but it's especially true of today because today is tax day today is one of the worst days in America it's also known as the fourth of July for Democrats but for Americans who work and hold a job it's a very terrible day president Trump acknowledged this in an op-ed he wrote Tuesday is a day hardworking Americans may dread more than any other tax day but that's not really why I've been drinking that's not why I'm so upset I hate shelling out my money to the federal government but the great shame of tax day I don't even know if I can say it Republicans gave us the income tax I know it pains me as much as it pains you it's really awful we will go through the history of that we will analyze why and how it was actually Republicans twice who gave us the income tax then speaking of the government taking all of our hard-earned money whatever happened to libertarianism whatever happened to the libertarian moment that we were all promised we will talk with libertarian broadcaster extraordinaire former Marine and foreign currency trader Jason Stapleton of the Jason Stapleton program and explain what happened and why the federal government is so big and bloated and stealing all of our money I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Nolt show how do you like the new digs this is kind of a plus for Tax Day I am in Mobile Alabama I'm gonna be speaking tonight at the Alabama Policy Institute and this is really good for Tax Day it's like a safe space for conservatives I just shelled out a bunch of money to the federal government a bunch of blank book money to the federal government very frustrating and the Trump tax cuts haven't cut kicked in yet so it was more money than I I wish we could have done I guess it's not so bad because I didn't do anything to make it but nevertheless I'll be in a safe space tonight with conservatives we can lament together if you happen to be in Mobile Alabama come on by the the Alabama Policy Institute and we will be discussing conservatism yesterday today and in the future and then I will be at Trump University on Thursday in Philadelphia so if here in the neighborhood come on by that speech will be on the topic reasons to vote for Trump it should be very good especially since it looks like he's brought peace to the Korean Peninsula that's also in the news maybe if we have a little time at the end of today we'll be able to get to that Oh after 70 years Donald Trump president Kofi Fay is finally the guy to bring peace to Korea not eisenhower not Kennedy not Reagan notjust Donald J Trump that is that is a beautiful thing so so it is tax day to celebrate tax day and also to give me an opportunity to just keep drinking we will discuss whatever happened to libertarianism you know in 2016 everybody in the media they told us this is the libertarian moment and conservatives talk a good game on this they say this is the libertarian moment we're gonna just we want small government and no spending and to keep to ourselves and put America first Rand Paul was supposed to be the the great candidate of course he was practically the first one out we will discuss with Jason Stapleton I spoke with him last week here he is Jason thank you for being here thank you so very much for having me on the show I appreciate so you are you're the new voice for liberty in America host of the Jason Stapleton program in 2016 in 2015 all I could read in Newsweek the New York Times all the mainstream media they said this is libertarian moment and it was gonna be Rand Paul was gonna run away with the nomination and this was finally the moment after years of Ron Paul we're gonna get a libertarian candidate what happened to the libertarian moment yeah that is a very very good question it's relatively easy to answer I think that you had two of the most polarizing and really if you want to be honest with it terrible candidates for president in the United States because neither one of them were we're really very well-liked and and what you ended up having was never was looking to third parties and this was the Libertarian Party has been around for forty years and they've been trying for a long time to figure out how they're gonna how they're gonna gain market share I guess in the political movement and this was a really key opportunity for them to kind of sell libertarianism as a viable third party option the problem is they picked the wrong candidate so they Rand Paul really didn't ever was never gonna be the candidate for the Republican Party and so that was never gonna happen so then you turn to the Libertarian Party and say okay who are they gonna put up well then they end up putting up what is really one of the one of the craziest guys that they could possibly pick who didn't really represent libertarianism well and then they got for his vice presidential candidate bill weld who was who was really just a Republican who decided he wanted to get into polish stay in politics and so he ran as a libertarian and well he wasn't even much of a libertarian Republican he was no he wasn't a Liberty it's not a libertarian at all this is one of the things that really offends yeah I guess offends those of us who really do hold these principles of you know we shouldn't hurt people and we shouldn't take their stuff which is at its core what libertarianism believes we reckoned it he had he had absolutely he did not represent the message because he wasn't a libertarian and so that was the problem we had a chance I think in 2016 to really show what libertarianism was to people and instead we decided to put up a safe candidate and we ended up scoring what three percent of the vote it was embarrassing right yeah you're not a big fan of Gary Johnson's performance as the libertarian nominee no it was even he's a terrible candidate I don't know the man personally he may be a very nice guy but in terms of his his candidacy it was an abject failure so if you had had it to do over again if the Libertarians had it to do over again to show what the Libertarian Party and the libertarian movement offers to the country how would you describe it and how would you describe the difference between a libertarian and a conservative some other kind of conservative yeah I think that it's core libertarians believe as I said before that we shouldn't hurt people and we shouldn't take their stuff and I think most people will align themselves with that if you talk to them one of the things that I find whether I'm talking with a very conservative person or whether they're talking with a progressive person that there there are principles of the libertarian ideology an idea that they can agree with so I talk about it on my show in terms of five basic principles they are limited government individualism peace tolerance and free markets now what I believe and what libertarians tend to believe is that when government is small when we value and respect other people when we focus on peace rather than violence and we focus on free markets where people can pursue their own self-interest and succeed or fail on their own merit that this produces more wealth and more opportunity for more people than any other system ever devised by man doesn't necessarily mean it's the best system it's just the best one we've found so far and so talking about the message the way Gary Johnson the bill well talked about it was oh we're kind of a mix we're part it's conservative and part progressive and the truth is that's that's not at all the case what what we believe is is a very principled position that says you own your body you own the byproduct of your labor and therefore government if it has a role to play if their job is to protect life liberty and property and nothing more so it is it's a very minimalist form of government that would exist under libertarianism that would really allow people to pursue their own self-interest without all of the things that everybody hates about government you know I've never heard it articulated that way but that is such a good point that libertarians say you own your body and I think why the religious right and more traditionalist conservatives probably break on that is they say you don't own your body your body is owned by God and you owe something to him you don't have the right to kill yourself you don't have the right to do all of those sorts of things does this mean though if it's don't don't hurt people and don't take their stuff does this mean that libertarians have to be pacifists no not at all in fact I'm not a pacifist with be believing in peace and advocating for peace is not the same thing as advocating for non-violence there there are certainly times when one it's time to be violent there's certainly times when war is is appropriate what we believe is as libertarians is they shouldn't aggress against someone which means we shouldn't try to impose our will on others and so in the case that someone would come to us and try and take our life our property then we have a right to defend ourselves against that and we should do that with you know with with savaged disregard for the others condition but I think that what we see right now in terms of foreign policy in America today is if I can the only way I know how to explain it is empire-building we're not really building empires but we are expanding the reach of American I guess American power through military action and this is something that libertarians disagree with just simply because we're essentially forcing imposing our will on others through the threat of violence and and and that's the difference between pacifism and what libertarians call non-violence and that that's well stated and I should point out for anyone who doesn't know you did serve in the Marine Corps that you you're certainly not a pacifist and now what does this at any point break down so it's easy to say I think everybody would basically agree with what you've said until one looks around this frequently very awful political scene in the world and sees some terrible country aggressing against another country or brutalizing its own people or dropping chemical bombs on its own people or whatever and we think well we could go in there and stop those tyrants and those brutal dictators from doing that is there a moral obligation to help when we can in a humanitarian way even if it's not it as a matter of self-defense yeah that's that's a really good question I think that my personal opinion is that there is a moral obligation to help but the that is the individuals responsibility to do so what a libertarian would believe is that okay if we are going to people one of the things I believe about the military is is that the mill the military guys are kind of unique because what they are essentially saying is I will give up my freedom I will give up my Liberty when you sign a military contract you are basically agreeing to go and do whatever the government says you are selling yourself to the government for a period of time and what I have always believed about that is that is a noble virtue to say I'm willing to do that I will turn over my Liberty and I will go so that when the time arises when lit when American liberty and freedom is threatened I will go and I will fight I will go and I will fight so that you don't have to I think that's admirable what I believe our responsibility as American citizens are is to ensure that we never ask them to do that unless it is absolutely necessary to protect American liberty not American interest those are two different things the government will always find an interest where it wants to exert its exert its authority what we're talking about or ism is a Liberty and if American Liberty isn't threatened then we have no responsibility of no right to send others who have raised their hand to volunteer to go and fight and die for someone else and now get I'm sorry I'm going to say just on the flip side to your question more specifically about the moral obligation we have if you really believe this is something this is a clamp this is something I have I've said to Mark Levin that I have said to to John McCain and Lindsey Graham I said listen if you want to go five you believe we need to go over there if you believe that we need to fight that we have a moral obligation to be there then I will pay for your plane ticket and I will buy you a rifle and you can go over there because that's if you really believe that we have a moral obligation then stand up and go I know that if I really believe that my liberty was threatened to my children risked living under the heel of tyrannies boots I would stand up and go fight and so if I'm not there it means I don't think it's important enough to put my own life on the line then I'm not gonna ask somebody else to do it for me and I think I think most people would agree with that too but what about again in the hard case where say you look at a failed state like Libya or you look at a failed state like Iraq or Syria at this point and you say well I there are interests that are threatened American liberty today may not explicitly be threatened even though we as we learned the hard way those people can now make it across the ocean and threaten our liberty and our safety but you say if we allow that place to fail the worst people in the region are gonna go in they're going to train they're going to brutalize people and they're gonna prepare to come attack us either in Europe or in the United States is there then some strategic interest in preventing that or pre-empting that or is that still absolutely not no another very good question and no I would respond it like this I would say potentially the first thing I would ask you is why why do we have failed States in Libya and Iraq well one could argue correctly that the reason we have those failed States is because of American foreign policy we all stood both of those dictators and we created the mess that's now over there and I don't think anybody can look at the situation in America that the threats of terrorism today and say we are a lot safer today than we were prior to 9/11 in fact all of our efforts all of our attempts to stabilize to control to you know to oust foreign dictators and put in put in people that would be more sympathetic to the principles of democracy and liberty that we want to promote every effort has led to a greater destabilization of the region and more violence and what I have said on my show repeatedly is I don't know what the right decision is but I know the wrong decision is to continue the same course of action that we've been on for the past whatever 15 years and so what I have said is let's try something radically different let's try leaving let's try not creating any more of a mess than we've already created and yes we are walking away from a gigantic mess and there will no doubt be vacuums that are created that must be filled and my suggest that I make is we are not solving the problem or fixing it with our current you know foreign policy you know interest so let's let's try something different that maybe will get us a better result if I'm wrong then we can try something different but I'm saying the violence the regime change the control hasn't helped in fact it's made the situation worse it's it's a good point to make we it is the longest war practically the longest war we've ever fought the war on terror writ large the war in Afghanistan there are some positive things that have come out of it that can't can't quite be accounted for the invasion of Iraq did leave to the denuclearization of Libya which led to the D Qadhafi ization of Libya which might not have been a good thing but is good one when they got rid of their nuclear program it's a good point we've we've been in the region for a while wars have been mismanaged every single day of Barack Obama's presidency was a day of war they told me if I voted for John McCain we'd get more war in the Middle East and they were right I voted for John McCain and we got more war in the Middle East right right so do you think that there's an appetite among the American people for I won't call it isolation but for pulling back Donald Trump campaigned in his words and said we need to have stopped having these wars in the Middle East he also said I'm gonna destroy Isis and go in and kill him and which guy one which guy is governing and who did the American people elect well III my gut feeling tells me and when you talk about the American people you're really talking about a mean I used to live in Kansas and in Kansas is very conservative and as I'm now live in LA which is very progressive and it's almost like being in a completely different country because you have very different opinions as a as a collective based on where you live and so I think if if I've got to pulse on the American people in general I think people don't want it I think everybody has had has been touched by this war in some way they all know somebody who's gone or somebody who's been there I think there is no appetite to send our men and women to fight and die when we don't understand what we're doing there how we win and what that looks like and what we're trying to accomplish and whether you look at Iraq or Afghanistan or what we're trying to do in Syria I mean there really isn't a clear plan on what it is we want to accomplish all we're doing is spending blood and coin and so I think that the American people are willing to stand and defend Liberty and they may be willing to even engage in things that I as a libertarian wouldn't agree with in terms of how we handle our foreign policy if they understand what it is we're trying to get done and the biggest problem with foreign policy today as it deals with our Wars is that there isn't any clear idea of what victory looks like and what we're going to do and then how we're gonna win I think Trump ran on this idea that we ought to pull our old people out of Iraq that it was a mess over there and I think now that he's in power there the military-industrial complex and the powerful that State Department bureaucracy absolutely well even even the the Lockheed Martin's and and and the people who have a vested interest in making sure that wars continue and they spend a lot of money in Washington and it's very very hard to to get around that sort of lobbying and so I think at the end of the day he's become subjected to the same pressures that Obama and Bush before him were subjected to do you think from the libertarian perspective is he exceeding your expectations I had very low expectations when he was elected so they certainly exceeded mine up and all in for the cough FA I've been pleasantly surprised do you do you think that he is advancing a liberty agenda not doing anything or damaging it yeah yes yes I know I think on some things he's done well I think he's reduced regulation I like that and tax decreases I like that I don't like the fact that he's adding to the deficits I do I absolutely abhor his foreign policy his his foreign policy and also his his trade policy I think those are very very damaging to America long-term so I think it's a mixed bag and one of the things I see I'm not left or right I don't I I don't I don't play politics I believe in five principles of Liberty and whoever supports and advocates those I'll support and if you support them in one area and not another then you'll get my support in the area where you support them I'm I am about principle not party and and so that's the Trump has been a mixed bag as as that goes this is my problem with the libertarian movement because I like so much of it I'm so agree with so much of it but I'm always reminded of the lord acton quote which I'm gonna butcher but it's something to the effect of the the Friends of Liberty have always been few and they have achieved their goals when they've achieved them by associating with auxiliaries whose own goals differ from the friends of liberty and there's a risk involved with this there's a moral risk but we do it anyway even though it could blow up in our face and really damage our seyh our integrity or our view of ourselves does the libertarian movement is the path forward for the freedom movement of the libertarian movement to form its own party have a viable third party get 2% of the vote 3% 5% try to grow it that way or is the goal to work within one of the two major parties and move the Republican Party more in its own direction yes I don't here's III have a real problem if you if anybody has listened to my show I've knows I I absolutely have disdain for the Libertarian Party I think they've done a terrible job of advocating the principles that we believe in they've done an even worse job of getting people elected and putting them in positions of authority where we might be able to effect some change on the same Sun on that same token it's very very difficult to get liberty minded people and libertarians specifically elected under the GOP because the Geo the GOP simply funds the the candidates that they want and makes it very difficult for guys Austin Peterson for example is a libertarian who's now running as a Republican in Missouri against Claire McCaskill I think he'd be a great choice he's an advocate for Liberty I know him personally and but he's going up against the GOP frontrunner who's raised ten million dollars and he just it's very very difficult for people to fight that so I think if we want libertarianism and these I these ideas that I just I've been talking about to ever gain traction we have to put some more people in power one way or another the guys like Rand Paul Justin Amash you know Thomas Massie I mean those guys need help in Washington and we cannot mount a defense against entrenched Republicans and endemic until we have more guys like that I always wonder with the libertarian movement which has you know vacillated in some ways it's left-wing in some ways and for certain periods it leans more right and they vote more Republican or with conservatives I wonder if people ask well well how come you don't just vote on issues how come you don't just vote on the candidate or the current party's coherent I wonder if it it does make sense if there is a kind of logical conclusion that comes from saying okay I believe in God I therefore support more freedom but I support this kind of strength and bla bla bla bla bla and for the left you know I don't I don't really know what they support like pot and high taxes or whatever they don't know what they do but if there's a kind of natural logical conclusion to those and does the libertarian movement find itself outside of that or to heterodox will it be forced to go one way or the other no III don't one of the things I love about libertarianism and the people who who or call themselves libertarians is that they they really do have a moral like a moral foundation so so for example I believe that things like rape and murder and and theft see I I think those are morally wrong not because God says they're wrong which is fine for Christians if that's the route they want to take but I believe that they're morally wrong because they violate someone's property rights I think morality starts with property rights it starts with the self ownership and it does not not to cut you off but if price if if that is the ground for it if property rights are the inviolable moral standard why why is that well because well if first of all it just starts with self ownership so we when people talk about property rights they think about my house or my car but really we're talking about self ownership and what do what is derived from that so if I own myself then clearly I would own the byproduct of my labor and if I own the byproduct of my labor I ought to be able to do what I want to with that with with either that is a fight if I chop down a tree and I build a chair out of it well that chair is now mine I've created a with my own hands and the byproduct of my labor therefore I ought to be able to sell it whoever I want to I ought to be able to set it on fire if I want to I ought to be able to do anything I want to with my own body and with with my own property and so if there is another reason beyond just a religious conviction then I would like I would love to know it to me the religious conviction is just a a personal belief in faith which is fine I have no issue with that at all I'm just saying from a more out moral perspective the reason that these things are immoral is not because God says so it's because it violates one's property rights I'm a little skeptical I think both of them were true I do think I think it's immoral because it violates property rights but I think that that's a good measure of morality because God says so and the reason I suggest this is that at in no culture that did not have metaphysical thought and metaphysical concepts did an idea like libertarianism or Liberty evolved the Western concept of Liberty CLEC came out of a Christian culture a culture that was informed and shaped by Christianity and I just wonder since we're talking about metaphysical things morality freedom justice fairness things that aren't tangible they're not Material I didn't create them I didn't create a moral code I didn't create justice because they're metaphysical and they're their pre they're beyond what is physical one must ask the question of what the metaphysical realm looks like why why are there ideas why or why is there a morality what where does the morality exist if there's justice who is the judge if if there is a moral legislation if there's a moral code then who's the legislator I not - not to proselytize to you on my show but I do wonder if that is a if that is a point of libertarianism that hasn't been followed to its logical beginnings or a finalist if I'm just the haven't had given you that old-time religion no note and no I here's the beautiful thing about libertarianism is that libertarianism allows for any religion it allows for any I mean frankly it allows for socialism if if you want to be honest I mean if people want to collectively come together and pool their own resources as long as it's being done voluntarily a libertarian is not going to object to that it's the voluntary nature of the action that's important to a libertarian and so when we talk about religion I have whatever religion one wants to believe and if you want to go back to you know talking about it philosophically I think that that's that's wonderful one of the things I harp on about libertarians is they spend a lot of time in the philosophical and I like to spend a lot of time in the reality of improving Liberty and free markets and and individualism a peace and tolerance over over trying to discuss the philosophical and but there's there's a place for that too so I think that inside the libertarian inside of libertarianism you are going to find Christians you are going to find atheists you're gonna find just a variety of people who believe in the idea that you own yourself and you own the byproduct of your labor that you shouldn't hurt people and you shouldn't take their stuff and so if you can agree fundamentally with those principles I think you're gonna find a lot of friends inside the the libertarian movement and I think frankly if you disagree with some of those principles as I do you'll still find a lot of common ground and friends in the Liberty movement I love your your dichotomy here between being up in the ether and the philosophical realm all the time and the practical effect of this because we're talking about politics we had Austin on the show Austin Peterson and I I wouldn't call myself a libertarian exactly but I'd vote for Austin in a heartbeat because I think he'd make the country better and I think he'd move it in a direction that is more open to Liberty and I really encourage people in politics to avoid what Michael Oakshott calls rationalism and politics and saying well who cares if it works in practice does it work in theory you know and really get down to the nuts and bolts and on the nuts and bolts of that the last question I guess we can talk about politicians writ large would you vote today for say Donald Trump's re-election or any of the Republicans in Congress or Senate for their reelection are they doing more good than they're doing harm or would you say we got to burn it we need a more liberty mind of Canada I don't believe in burning things down I've been like I said you know I've been in a couple of different war zones and I think the idea that we would we would burn something to the ground just creates people don't understand what that means I have a very simple philosophy on whether or not someone gets my vote I ask one question do they believe as a primary do they believe in liberty as a primary political value and what I mean by that is just simply do I believe that this candidate will constantly ask with every decision that he makes does this move us closer towards Liberty or further away now because in politics you it's a lot of horse trading so you're gonna have to do some give-and-take I can account I'm not so much of a purist that I won't accept that but what I want is I want at the end of the day after the horse trading is done I want to be further I want to be closer towards tyranny and further towards statism or totalitarianism and if I have if I have a candidate if I have a someone who's in office who I believe really is trying to do that and is asking that question then they'll get my vote that's absolutely and it's it's funny that you bring up the example of the military because so many of my friends who have served were family members they do trend a little bit libertarian and I think it might be because that is a real practical job and career and you you really see very quickly what's working and what's not working and yeah it's a really great point Jason we got to go I'm gonna let you get back to your show but great to talk to you we're gonna have to have you back the Jason Stapleton program a new voice for liberty in America thanks so much you know I was looking at my Twitter feed while we were playing that interview and I had women writing into me led by none other than our own Alicia Krause writing into me and saying oh Michael Jason Stapleton hubba-hubba thanks baby yeah so I and I guess that's like the answer to the panel of deplorable zz you know I bring on for months and months and months just the most beautiful women in the conservative movement but basically just for my own edification and so it's okay we'll throw you a little heartthrob libertarian man every once in a while for the ladies who watch the show we have to say goodbye to Facebook in YouTube but stick around because we're gonna talk about the great shame the great stain on the Republican Party Republican Party is pretty good we've always stood for ordered Liberty you know we free the slaves who want more Liberty these days we defend life as a great party except we invented the income tax I'll watch my language about salty language coming bursting forth on this awful subject will explain that afterward if you were on Daily wire calm already thank you very much you help keep the lights on in this meeting space and in my studio if you're not go over there it's ten bucks a month 100 dollars for an annual membership you get me at the under Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get to ask questions in the mailbag coming up tomorrow no coming up on Thursday so make sure you get your questions in you get to ask questions in the conversation many are called few were chosen I'm up next in the conversation remember you can get my show on facebook on youtube on itunes on soundcloud i think on gramophone i think we have wax records that you can buy if you take a time machine back to the old timey days before we had an income tax and you can get two daily wire.com again none of it matters for the shows no one actually wants to listen to the shows or watch ben or drew or the conversation that doesn't matter what matters is the leftist here's tumblr guys Donald Trump is about to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula that is an absurd statement that is one of the funniest things to happen in politics in my lifetime certainly when that happens you are going to see storms rage not because a nuclear weapon was dropped you know by the Sea of Japan or whatever it's because the leftist tears are gonna flow freely in the United States you're gonna need your vessel to protect yourself and your family they're radioactive the fallout is going to be horrific make sure you go to daily wire comm we'll be right back to complain about Republicans inventing income tax a true historical irony a true you know Republicans now what a great party we are it is the best party in American history and we took the traditions of the Federalists and then every terrible thing that the Democrats did we opposed the Republican Party was founded to free the slaves we opposed Jim Crow the Democrats wanted slaver they wanted Jim Crow we were the first party support civil rights we you know we're just like we defend the unborn Democrats want to slaughter all those babies we defend the unborn we just got that right at the very beginning we got this thing wrong on the income tax and it wasn't like it just happened over time wasn't like oh some new Republicans some weird no it was the first Republican President issued the first income tax it was the Revenue Act of 1861 it was the first Republican President Abraham Lincoln he he did it because he had to raise 50 million dollars in revenue to make the Democrats free all their slaves so he had to raise all that revenue and they couldn't do it so they came up with a plan it would include a mixture of tariffs property tax and income tax incomes over you know a certain threshold not everybody was taxed but some people are so that happened and then we made the Democrats free all their slaves and reunited the country and so that was good that's fine then it sort of went away for a while but we can't just let them off the hook that easily because this this poison this poisonous idea of taking all of Americans hard-earned money that kept seeping into the culture so in 1909 it wasn't some Democrat who proposed a new constitutional amendment or a new income tax it was a Republican and a conservative Republican William Howard Taft proposed to two percent income tax on corporations and a constitutional amendment to collect individual income tax now we should say there it's not like people just didn't pay any taxes before it's that the taxes were not on their income that they were they were hidden there were a lot of tariffs there were huge tariffs threat all of our history because you do have to fund the government government does cost money to run so there was that and then in 1909 there was some question over what the most effective way to raise revenue was because tariffs have lot of downsides to them as we all know I mean that's why Donald Trump is threatening tariffs now I don't think we're gonna see huge trade Wars he's doing it because China is cheating and there they are not participating in free trade and they're violating World Trade Organization treaties and they're stealing our intellectual property and they're illegally subsidizing your industries so there are there are some arguments for using this as leverage but tariffs have a lot of tough externalities to them one of which is at this time when the income tax was being proposed there was high inflation this was being blamed on tariffs rather than an income tax so anyway enough excuses enough defending the Republican Party it was William Howard Taft who first proposed this the Republican president the conservative Republican president then the first senator to propose the the income tax was a Republican senator Norris Brown so okay they proposed this very modest income tax the the highest marginal rate in the early days of this income tax was 6% really was just two or three percent and then the very highest marginal rate was 6% of income okay within five years this is the problem look if someone wanted to take two percent of my income to fund the government I can deal with that I can live you know but what's so insidious is when the government gets its claws into your money they just take and take and take you give them your little pinky and they take your hand so within five years of the income tax federal income tax being instituted the top marginal rate went from six percent to 77 percent that is a huge increase that is over an order of magnitude increase and a lot of this was to fund World War one so they said okay look we have this big war we raised revenue during the Civil War so we're gonna raise revenue again by raising taxes tremendously I'm soaking the rich to pay for this war okay that's fine then after the war the tax rate went back down the top marginal rate went back down to 24% okay that's five twenty four percent better than seventy seven percent but notice how we're bouncing around right at first it's this little modest tax and one or two percent of six percent top rate look at seventy seven percent we're gonna go back down to twenty four percent well twenty four percent is still four times higher than six percent that's still many multiples higher than the previous highest marginal rate just a few years earlier okay that's fine the right but then FDR comes in and this is where we shift the blame to Demick rats as Republicans we decide we were gonna play nicely we were gonna say okay look I guess you need a little revenue here there we're gonna be responsible about this but the trouble with that is the Democrats seized on these things and they they run with it way beyond any boundaries of reason so FDR comes in and he decides that he is going to raise the the rates tremendously and not for the purposes of raising revenue actually I mean there was part of that you had to raise revenue for the second world war but FDR proposed a 100 percent tax on all income over twenty five thousand dollars one hundred that's just wealth confiscation at that point for fairness for purposes of fairness and equality and that the purposes of the income tax system right now are not to raise revenue that's that we're not really fighting major Wars we're in the middle of a world war or something or a civil war that's bloodying up our entire country they're just doing it for purposes of fairness or equality and this is an amazing thing because apparently fairness is when you steal somebody else's money and then give it to a guy who isn't working as hard that's fairness you see greed greed is when I want to keep the money that I have made but a charity is when I steal somebody else's money and keep it for myself that's that's compassion that's charity so FDR changes the game entirely and it's no surprise that during FDR's time we see a taxation tax revenue as a percentage of GDP shoot through the roof in the early days of the income tax the from basically the founding of the country the eighteenth century all the way up to the creation of the income tax here and there you see up until I guess about 1940 you see the revenue the tax revenue is something like five percent at most of total GDP it's very low between three sometimes maybe up to seven percent depending on how you're measuring it then FDR comes in in 1940's this thing explodes you get way way higher rates multiples higher rates and it stayed there ever since you know for the purposes of equality and fairness and you paid your tab well I don't know my audience probably you haven't paid your taxes but like you know good people pay their taxes and everything and guess they they won they don't want to be targeted by the IRS and to you know K I live in this country I have to pay my taxes and it may just bleed us dry so FDR obviously ruined all of this stuff during World War two you know the rates go really high FDR doesn't realize that at a certain point if you're taxed 100 percent above a certain income then you're just not gonna work why would I work what if I if I can work 50 hours a week to make twenty five thousand dollars or I can work a hundred hours a week to make fifty thousand dollars but I know that all of that extra wealth is going to be confiscated why there's no incentive to work this is kind of the early stages of the Laffer curve this is kind of the early Inklings of this that conservatives would run with for years and which formed a lot of the Reagan Revolution but even JFK who did this he said there's a there there are two tax rates at least where you have the exact same revenue to the government zero percent and a hundred percent if the tax rate is zero percent the government's not going to get any of my money if the tax rate is a hundred percent I'm not going to work so there are two so we see a curve here and there are always two tax rates at which you'll get the same revenue to the government so that didn't work FDR wanted this one hundred percent income tax Congress said it absolutely not that was so radical so then FDR decided to issue executive orders for wage controls this created a lot of economic problems but fine then throughout the 1940s 1950s you had a forget about six percent just a few decades prior you know the highest marginal tax rates were ninety one percent ninety two percent JFK comes in he lowered the taxes and consolidated the rates to 77 percent then to 70 percent starting in 1965 okay I guess that's better than 91 or 92 percent but you see do you see the the trend here you go low rate really high rate lower but still higher than you started higher doing you go all the way up then Ronald Reagan came in he lowered the rate to 50 percent the top marginal tax rate that was from 1982 to 1986 but there were revenue revenue problems there's a lot of government spending so Reagan ultimately undid a fair portion of those tax cuts then the top rate was lowered to 38 point five percent then the top rate was a lower to 28% George Bush one who famously promised to read my lips no new taxes immediately ran and raised taxes I was like the first thing he did that's pretty why didn't win re-election then Clinton raised the top rate to 39.6% Bush to lowered it to 35 then it went back up to 39.6 Trump lowered it very very modestly to 37% that's the highest marginal tax rate now in the Trump tax reform so we know that virtually all of the federal income taxes are paid by a very very small percentage of people and most Americans pay net negative tack now they're all these hidden taxes of course that you pay sales tax payroll tax there they get you coming and going but most taxes are paid for by the rich by a very small number of people this gets to just an important point on taxes because obviously it's morally absurd to say that it's greedy for me to keep my own money but it's charitable for me to steal somebody else's money or for you to steal my money or something like that but taxes let low taxes or a good per se they're not the Democrats always say well how are you gonna pay for that tax cut I got two words for you buddy and they're not happy birthday when you say are you gonna pay for that tax cut it's my money that's how I'm gonna pay for it I'm gonna keep it that's how I'm gonna pay for my tax cut well how are you gonna pay for it as though they're entitled to my money they're not entitled to our money that is not true we contribute because we like our country I guess and really because we have to but lower taxes are a good good per se it is a reflection of freedom I work and so I make money and so the money is a symbol of my work of my labor of my liberty of my lifetime of my life that I spend if you're paying half of your money out in taxes that means that for half the year you're a slave to the government that's not a good thing to be we don't like that tradition in America they try to accuse a seller you just what you're agreed you want to keep your money y'all want to keep my life I want to keep my life the money is a symbol of my Liberty the Liberty is what I it's what I do during my life man and your steel in my life it's a good per se and Republicans should get off of this bean-counting technocratic nonsense where we sell we've got to pay for this so it's gonna be revenue neutral I don't want to revenue-neutral i want tax reform to starve the beast I want it I want revenue to be way down and then I want to have to cut government spending because it infringes on our Liberty is not good an important thing to keep in mind on tax day we forget this the rest of the year it's so you know initially with taxes you would pay your Congressman you would there wasn't this massive bureaucracy of the IRS and the Congress didn't really like that too much you know because then then there's accountability there is I don't like paying all these taxes you could vote them out of office so now there are these huge bureaus it's very complicated it's so a Paik it's gonna get a little bit better with tax reform next year it's gonna be simplified a little bit but it's just dreadful it's just a dreadful thing when we forget about it they take it right out of our paychecks because they know that we don't like paying it so unless you're self-employed you it just comes out of your paycheck you think Oh goody-goody I got a tax return oh how nice the government gave me a tax return their government to give you a tax return you just paid too much money throughout the year they just soaked you too much throughout the rest of the year don't be don't be fooled by that is really awful and tax day is the day to remember the pain of paying taxes and we need people in that in our federal government we need people in our state and local governments who are aware that every dollar they take out of our pockets should be accounted for it should be for a good reason and if they can't give a good reason vote the bums out okay happy tax
