I got really involved into the raw food community kale being one of the highest nutrient dense leafy greens they have that's one thing I really wanted to push towards we started in a one car garage and I actually had these xcalibur dehydrators I started with three and I think we stopped at 50 before we got to some bigger commercial stuff it's been a lot of work in the last three and a half years I'm just moving facilities and trying to keep up with the demand at the same time a lot of companies that come up with products today really go to co-packers and it's very easy to scale your business very quickly which I would love to have done but who has dehydration system that big that dehydrate food is controlled below 115 degrees and that's one of the reasons why they're so expensive they actually we dehydrate the food for 12 to 18 hours sits in these dryers below 115 degrees everything is handmade everything is certified non-gmo everything is certified organic and it's real food you're eating real food it's gonna cost more than a processed chip that's not even real food we are in a lot of your natural stores now across the United States for all through Canada we're now just starting to get into the conventional tight grocery stores they're actually now taking the raw food sets that are not putting it in those aisles and creating their own raw food section because it is all good organic real food and that's why all of it has a higher price point we're gonna be buying some equipment to help bring down some of our labor cost you know we do predict by the end of this year we actually will probably start making a profit be honestly I haven't made a dime in this business yet it's kind of hard to believe we're nationwide
