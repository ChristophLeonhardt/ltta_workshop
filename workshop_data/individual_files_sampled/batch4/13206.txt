the ouster of Rex Tillerson as I say they the Oedipus Rex Tyrannosaurus Rex - Rex it he's gone okay so Rex Tillerson was always a crappy Secretary of State he was at a complete disconnect with the President of the United States the president did not care in the slightest what Rex Tillerson had to say about anything like anything making for ex Tillerson ordered ordered a steak for dinner then president Trump would send it back and get a hamburger I mean this is just the way it went with him Rex Tillerson they never got along Tillerson always wanted to run foreign policy Trump didn't want any part of that you recall the President Trump actually tweeted out in the middle of Rex Tillerson talking with the North Koreans that Rex Tillerson should not talk with the North Koreans see the nice thing about Trump and you know one of the great fears that Trump was gonna run a secret agenda when he was president who won't gonna know what he was thinking and then there's this thing called Twitter where it's legitimately just him vomiting his thoughts and Twitter says like there's a big secret about Rex Tillerson he doesn't like the guy he thinks the Rexel are sins of schmuck which is true Rex Tillerson was basically marginalized inside his own State Department no one cared what he had to say on Tuesday morning the president tweeted out his favorite of Rex Tillerson because this is the way you should totally get rid of cabinet-level officers is by tweeting out that they're gone and then they look around and go wait what now huh so he this is also how he got rid of James Comey as you recall he had him fired in the middle of an event for the FBI out on the west coast the president of United States running government by it by Twitter listen I'm happy with the move I didn't like Rex Tillerson I think he's a terrible Secretary of State I think he's been utterly utterly useless all of the good moves the Trump administration has made have been made in spite of teller syns opinion Tillerson has been marginalized in the process for a very long time so Trump tweeted the south is 18 all right so here is what he tweeted out is that the was this Mike Pompeo director of the CIA will become our new Secretary of State he will do a fantastic job thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service Jeana Haspel will become the new director of the CIA and the first woman so chosen congratulations to all I mean not all right congratulations everybody except for Rex Tillerson whose new job apparently Tillerson had no idea that he was actually gonna be fired apparently so the Washington Post reported that Rex Tillerson was told that he was on the ropes as of last Friday now the reason that's important is because today Rex Tillerson did a whole press campaign about how terrible Russia was he was talking specifically about how the Russian government had killed apparently in X so via in X Russian spy in Great Britain and the UK was targeting Russia over this and Tillerson said yeah the Russians killed this spy as well as one other person and they are and they're in our crosshairs and then the White House backed off and they said no no no you know we'll look at it maybe we'll kind of look at
