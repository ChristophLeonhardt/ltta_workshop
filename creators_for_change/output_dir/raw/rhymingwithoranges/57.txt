00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,179
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago I made a video predicting</font>

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:04,410
all of the things that would go up in

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,600
the following<font color="#E5E5E5"> year and go down in the</font>

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">following year I have wanted to do this</font>

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">again for a while so I'm deciding to do</font>

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,280
it for 2016 does that sound good

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,590
excellent so join me on a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> foray</font>

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,140
into the predictions of what's going to

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,230
be hot and what's going to be not in the

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,710
world of 2016 good good going up ray

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,019
from the star wars franchise some of you

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,520
may be slightly confused by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,710
I recently made a video entitled I hated

full body Durant and I'll be honest the

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,160
only reason I see ray going up in the

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">year 2016 is because frankly we've</font>

people such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Black Widow and Gomorrah</font>

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,640
she's also been branded as a mary-sue

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,320
character which<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wikipedia hopefully</font>

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,210
describes this a young or low<font color="#E5E5E5"> ranked</font>

everybody's mouth and there's this

53
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,920
inexplicable hate for video sponsored by
