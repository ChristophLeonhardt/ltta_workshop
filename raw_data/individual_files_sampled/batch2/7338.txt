we got cops killing people over loose cigarettes I mean I can't think of a more minor offense yeah it's ridiculous look the New York City created the the untaxed cigarettes phenomenon by creating the highest consumption taxes on cigarettes in the country I think it cost about $14 a pack right now to buy cigarettes in New York so it creates an instant arbitrage for anybody who has a car and garner he something entrepreneurial kicked into overdrive when he heard about this he got out of jail and he heard about this he missed the tax hike and he started sending people down to Virginia and they would bring back cartons of smokes that big block for essentially five dollars a pack and then up here in New York he would sell them for nine dollars a pack and then if there were losses he was essentially making $10 a pack great business right and it was instantly brought into being by the fact that New York City just happens to have behind high cigarette taxes and the the interesting thing was you know garner his whole life had been on the wrong side of racists sentencing policies right like we're you know if a white guy gets caught with powder cocaine in his pocket it's one thing if a black guy gets caught with crack cocaine the sentences are much much harsher and he paid for that he went he went to prison for for for crack in this case the the everything was backwards selling untaxed cigarettes is barely a misdemeanor in New York State and garner even had a term for it he called it felony money misdemeanor time and he he thought he had hit the jackpot but then he started to get harassed over and over by the police and it became a much more serious problem than he anticipated and in Garner's case this was particularly poignant because he was killed in an incident on a day when he wasn't even selling cigarettes and now we know that that's what he did for a living I talked to basically everybody who was there that day and I know a minute for a minute what he was doing that day he wasn't selling cigarettes that day so the state has awesome awesome power to to intrude in the lives of people but that doesn't seem to bother libertarians when it involves this segment of the population
