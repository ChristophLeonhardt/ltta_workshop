himself but I mean come on still it has his name on it and so this is his position on Medicare for all one of the the biggest up-and-coming policy that more and more politicians are signing on to and his op-ed attacking it is full of the absolute worst kind of lies so we're gonna give you a couple of excerpts from the op-ed and then break down all the the lies and misconceptions he spreads about what Medicare for all would actually accomplish he says dishonestly called Medicare for all the Democratic proposal would establish a government-run single-payer health care system that eliminates all private and employer-based health care plans that would cost an astonishing thirty two point six trillion dollars during its first ten years I agree with almost every word of that except I would add to a thirty two point six trillion dollars during its first ten years which is a savings of several trillion dollars over the system we have right now but he wants to scare people about the supposed price tag yeah I think he's making a mistake here I'm gonna we're gonna break down all of his lies and it's gonna be fun and and it's already there's a big one in there it doesn't necessarily and your ability to get private health insurance on top if you want what it does is it covers everyone in the country which is fantastic but the mistake that they're making is starting this conversation so I just gave them credit earlier in the show for they're good at starting conversations about all the Liberals mob rule and then we're having a nonsense debate about a non-issue etc but it should have picked this fight because then they're forces every news outlet in the country to say actually here's what Medicare for all does and then people read it or watch and go wait and I would get to be covered just like my that is in retirement it's I don't know if you about you guys but I've talked about this in the post games before as well T y-t-dot-com slash join to become a member and get post games but my mom and dad now that they were Medicare like it's fantastic like oh we made it finally 65 it's insanity well I of course we got to let the whole country into it so him writing this op-ed is a terrible mistake because it starts a conversation that we would love to have yeah and while we're gonna break down a lot of the the lies in it um you know even like you can see like the Washington Post is doing it for instance and they have to because now he's making very specific claims that you can look into to be to be clear USA Today didn't look in any of these and they apparently believe that if it's coming from Donald Trump they can publish it doesn't matter you don't need to actually make sure that what he's saying is actually true which is a stance you can take as a news outlet he goes on to say in practice the Democratic Party's so-called medicare-for-all would really be Medicare for none under that's weird under the Democrats playing today's Medicare would be forced to die well it'd mean it'd be bigger it would cover everyone is that a form of death I don't know maybe like a cocoon with like a butterfly coming out of it it's technically death but it's beautiful in the end no I mean I'm not gonna have a conversation with this these absurdities they're these it's not Medicare for none it's called Medicare for oh okay so when we said black lives matter they said well no all lives matter now we say Medicare for all like all lives matter they're like no they don't know no lies matter what what do you mean it it's literally everyone would be able to have Medicare the same thing that people have in Medicare how is that Medicare for none I don't know it's just I don't know trumpet said who make it up and say one last thing to and hopefully if there's any sort of centrist Democrats that are watching this just want you to bear this in mind when you're thinking about which positions to take going to election he says the truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead the new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America's economy after Venezuela if Democrats win control of Congress this November we will come dangerously closer to socialism in America so again this should have been obvious before but it doesn't matter what positions you take they're going to call you a radical socialist so why not actually push the policies that people actually want and would fix a lot of problems but now to get into the specific things that he has set there many he says specifically that the the plans that are out there right now for Medicare for all would take away benefits from seniors a lot of his op-ed is actually fear-mongering specifically about what Medicare for all would represent for seniors it's not in any way true the the leading plan right now the Bernie Sanders plan actually adds things like dental and vision insurance pays for hearing aids things like that that are not covered under a traditional coverage right now and so the idea that this is going to result in funding cuts for seniors or worse coverage for seniors is simply not true and all of the fact checkers thankfully or being very clear about that okay so lots of hilarious things in here to go back to the socialism for a second he wrote the truth he said virtually everywhere it has been tried socialism has brought suffering misery and decay like Norway Finland Sweden oops in those countries of course they always mention Venezuela but arguably the most socialist countries in the world are in northern Europe where they are doing fantastic yeah I Got News for you after Finland tried it they were not finished okay I'm here all day all week but here's my favorite part so he goes on he says throughout his job Bush I'm gonna protect you guys I alone can protect you seniors they're coming for your Medicare okay and he said I am resolutely going to protect you Medicare and Social Security then he turns around and says about Medicare for all he says government-run health care is just the beginning wait a minute Medicare is a government-run health care yeah I thought you said you were gonna protect it oops government-run health care the Democrats are trying to take it away yeah we I forgot what I was saying he also says that they would take your Medicare and they would then give total power and control the bureaucrats in Washington DC well I I think you know what Medicare is man so some other specifics he says that the Dems will seek to quote slash budgets for seniors on things like Medicare Social Security and Defense the thing is the Republicans have been very clear all this year they are coming for all of these programs they are expecting to make massive cuts and they need to to pay for the tax cuts they gave earlier this year so that is a complete lie and a dodge that is the position of your party Donald Trump specifically one thing he says that they will take away coverage for pre-existing conditions and that he has promised to protect pre-existing conditions that is a complete lie back during the various debates in the last year over uh repealing the ACA he signed on and agreed to plans that would have eliminated protections for pre-existing conditions he was totally fine for those at that point and even as we speak the Trump administration is arguing in court that the protections for those with pre-existing conditions in the ACA is unconstitutional and they should not have to defend those so he is lying to you both before and after writing this specifically about pre-existing conditions okay we're not done to more amazing lies in this and and look it's not a miscommunication it's not a misinterpretation near just flat-out lies so he said Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicaid by Medicare by more than eight hundred billion dollars over ten years to pay for Obama care that's a lie that's so audacious that I had to look it up and I'm like what how like he is going to twist something into like into something else of course it's not true but like what is even talking about no just made up at a whole cloth in reality the Democrats added to Medicare in a way that extends its solvency by twelve years it's the exact opposite but I mean he lies so brazenly that you like I'm constantly googling things like did Democrats really attack Medicare with a banana like what like did that no I'm like where did he get that from did Fox News once say Medicare and banana in the same sentence like where is he making work and it is it's just made up out of whole cloth and sometimes things that are one thing and just flip it and just see the exact opposite right okay and last one here is he said there would be massive rationing of health care doctors and hospitals would be put out of business that's right the decorating plan is there will be no more hospitals or doctors okay hospitals doctors you go go go for it from now plumbers will do it but that's not what I'm talking about he that says at the end previously covered care would effectively be denied once again the exact opposite of what is true in Bernie Sanders Medicare for all program seniors would have extra benefits there's nothing taken away from them in fact it would get dental and vision and a couple of other additional benefits on top of what they already have but he took that and said oh they're adding benefits to seniors well why don't I lie and pretend it's the exact opposite and that they would take away your health care right and that's what this is and that's who Donald Trump is that's why now whenever I in previous administrations like the Bush administration et cetera were they good guys no they were terrible guys Cheney did torture they started illegal Wars etc etc but Cheney would have enough decency to manipulate things so that his lies had some degree of credibility right Mohamed Atta was once in Europe so perhaps he could have met with Saddam agents in the former Czechoslovakia I don't know whatever there was like a strand of truth that you could say well maybe he meant that know with with with Trump and maybe because he's not as sophisticated as Dick Cheney and not as good at lying or maybe just and of course the reality does not care about the truth yeah he's never cared about it he's lied his whole life remember he's the guy who would call the press pretending to be John Baron or John Miller and he would call him and go yeah this is a not Donald Trump this is John Baron I'm calling to tell you that Donald Trump is dating Madonna and he's fantastic in bed literally okay that's the kind of stuff you would talk about how he was dating celebrities like Madonna and how great he was in bed that's this idiot that's this unbelievable pathological liar that is now the present writing articles about medicare-for-all it's actually it's actually Medicare for none nighter I coined that yeah I know you corn is not true look go tell your Republican friends and family they didn't get insulted all they want watch this video watch any of these videos and then for God's sake look it up yourself right go look at any fact check but if you say hey everything in the world is fake accept what Donald Trump says okay you've lost your mind and we're done with it because then we can't have a conversation but if you still in the rational world do not believe a word this guy says on the go don't worry we got you covered you still listen to T YT at our new podcast network find us on Apple podcast at Google
