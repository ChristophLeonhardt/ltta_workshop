speaking of great things getting worse Starbucks Starbucks is going full homeless camp now so you'll remember earlier this month a black man was arrested at Starbucks and this became a big hullabaloo and the reason he the police were called I suppose he wasn't arrested the police were called and it's because these guys came in and were just sitting at the table and after a while one of the employees came up and said hey you have to purchase a product in order to sit and use our space you can't just sit here this isn't like a public park you've got to buy our product to be here they said no which are you kidding me you go how rude and ridiculous you go and you buy the product but they said no we're not gonna some multiple times they come always say hey you know you gotta buy something he said no they asked them to leave and they said no like bartleby the scrivener no I'd prefer not to no I prefer not to so eventually they call the police and this became some big big news story as though as though it's horrifying that an employer that a store says you have to buy their product to be in their space anywho Starbucks instead of saying hey guys you have to buy our product to be in our space they're now saying no no you don't need to buy anything you can hang out here you can use our bathrooms anybody who's in our space even if they don't buy a product their customers which just isn't true because customer has a definition again as Starbucks can't change the definition of a word
