00:00:11,658 --> 00:00:13,059
>>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE

2
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:14,494
DEMOCRATS SAY THEY REALLY CARE

3
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:15,695
ABOUT POLICY.

4
00:00:15,695 --> 00:00:17,964
THEY HAVE HAD COMPLETE CONTROL

5
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:21,634
OF CALIFORNIA FOR A LONG TIME.

6
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:23,903
>> DESPITE LOW UNEMPLOYMENT AND

7
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:28,341
A BOOMING STOCK MARKET POVERTY

8
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:29,976
IS A PROBLEM IN THE U.S.

9
00:00:29,976 --> 00:00:32,244
THE POVERTY RATE INCLUDING THE

10
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:37,050
COST OF LIVING IN THE U.S. IS

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:37,350
14.7%.

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,587
IN CALIFORNIA IT'S 24%.

13
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:41,921
HOMELESSNESS IS GROWING UP

14
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:45,692
ACROSS THE COUNTRY UP 1% BETWEEN

15
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:48,394
2016 AND 2017 NOWHERE IS IT MORE

16
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:50,096
IN CALIFORNIA.

17
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:52,432
ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT HAVENS

18
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:55,568
IS IN DOWNTOWN LAS ANGELES.

19
00:00:55,568 --> 00:00:58,605
A HOMELESS COMMUNITY CALLED SKID

20
00:00:58,605 --> 00:00:58,871
ROW.

21
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:00,440
PEOPLE LIVE OPENLY ON THE

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,778
STREETS IN CAMPS IN TENT CITIES.

23
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:07,914
IN 2010 MORE THAN HALF MILLION

24
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:09,115
PEOPLE WERE HOMELESS.

25
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:12,885
MOST OF THEM WERE IN CALIFORNIA.

26
00:01:12,885 --> 00:01:14,387
FOLLOWED BY NEW YORK, FLORIDA,

27
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:15,321
AND TEXAS.

28
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:17,023
IN CALIFORNIA THE AVERAGE HOME

29
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:19,259
PRICE IS AROUND $600,000.

30
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,894
YOU HAVE TO EARN OVER $100,000

31
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:25,031
PER YEAR TO RENT AN AVERAGE 2

32
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:28,768
BEDROOM APARTMENT.

33
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:31,904
HOMELESSNESS HAS CAUSED A RISE

34
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,040
OF CRIME IN NEIGHBORHOODS.

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,076
THEY BELIEVE SOME OF THIS IS DUE

36
00:01:37,076 --> 00:01:40,280
TO PROPOSITION 46 PASSED BY

37
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,748
GOVERNOR BROWN.

38
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:44,550
CRITICS SAY NOW DRUG ADDICTS

39
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,186
ESCAPE PUNISHMENT FOR CRIMES TO

40
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:49,622
SUPPORT THEIR HABITS.

41
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:52,925
ANY THEFT UNDER $950 MAY NOT BE

42
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:55,662
SUBJECT TO JAIL TIME.

43
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:55,962
STEVE.

44
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:57,697
STEVE: ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

45
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:58,931
WE TALKED ABOUT CRIME.

46
00:01:58,931 --> 00:02:01,634
THERE IS SO MUCH ELSE TO

47
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:02,135
EXPLORE.

48
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:03,970
LET'S GET BACK TO THE QUESTION

49
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,640
IF CALIFORNIA UNDER JERRY BROWN

50
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,842
IS A MODEL TO THE REST OF THE

51
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:11,177
COUNTRY.

52
00:02:11,177 --> 00:02:13,813
IT SHOWS WHAT HAS GONE WRONG.

53
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:18,451
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA IS BOOMING.

54
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:19,352
SILICON VALLEY.

55
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:22,622
FOR THOSE DOING WELL, IT'S

56
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:22,922
GREAT.

57
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:24,324
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT

58
00:02:24,324 --> 00:02:25,758
HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

59
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:27,460
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN IN

60
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,162
CHARGE FOR A LONG TIME.

61
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:30,830
>> THE POVERTY RATE IN THE

62
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,867
COUNTRY IS $25,100 FOR A FAMILY

63
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:36,803
OF FOUR.

64
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:38,538
15% 3% OF CALIFORNIANS FALL

65
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:39,439
UNDER THAT.

66
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,976
IT'S HIGHER IN TEXAS.

67
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:46,312
IT'S 22% IN MISSISSIPPI.

68
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:48,147
HOUSING IS EXPENSIVE.

69
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:50,950
USED CARS AND FRESH PRODUCE IS

70
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,687
LESS EXPENSING AND WE SPEND

71
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:58,624
NOTHING ON HOME HEATING OIL.

72
00:02:58,624 --> 00:03:01,260
THAT MIGHT BE HARD TO LIVE ON.

73
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,596
THE MAIN REASON IS THE HIGH COST

74
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:05,631
OF HOUSING AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE

75
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:06,866
HAD POPULATION GROWTH.

76
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,568
PEOPLE VOTE WITH THEIR FEET.

77
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:11,704
MOST OF AMERICAN CITIZENS --

78
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:13,806
EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN CAN PICK

79
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:17,443
WHICH OF THE 50 STATES TO

80
00:03:17,443 --> 00:03:18,878
LIVE-IN AND THEY CHOSE

81
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:19,278
CALIFORNIA.

82
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:21,114
THAT DROVE UP THE HOUSING

83
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:21,447
PRICES.

84
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:24,484
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SCIENCE,

85
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:25,485
TECHNOLOGY, AND COLLEGES THAT SO

86
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:27,987
MANY PEOPLE ARE COMING HERE.

87
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:30,022
YOU GET MORE AND MORE CITIZENS

88
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:31,858
BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.

89
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:33,659
WE ARE THE BIGGEST STATE AND

90
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,496
PUTS A STRAIN ON THE HOUSING

91
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:36,829
MARKET.

92
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,531
STEVE: I WOULD LOVE TO BELIEVE

93
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:39,265
THAT'S TRUE.

94
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:40,333
I LOVE CALIFORNIA.

95
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,668
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ANYWHERE

96
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:44,103
ELSE IN THE WORLD.

97
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:47,140
THAT STORY OF AN OPEN CALIFORNIA

98
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,574
IS A GREAT STORY.

99
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,777
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE

100
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:51,544
REALTY.

101
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,413
>> YEAH, THE REALTY IS WORKING

102
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:54,947
AMERICANS ARE ON THE STREETS

103
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:56,182
RIGHT NOW.

104
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:58,985
WE CAN TAKE $22 BILLION AND HELP

105
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:01,521
OUT HOMELESSNESS.

106
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,856
ESPECIALLY THE 10,000 LIVING

107
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:04,223
DOWNTOWN.

108
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,658
WE HAVE TO STEP-IN.

109
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:07,193
THAT'S WHY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

110
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:10,930
WILL STEP-IN AND BUDGET THINGS

111
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,532
BETTER.

112
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,066
>> HOMELESSNESS IN LAS ANGELES

113
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:19,105
COUNTY AND CITY ARE DOWN OVER

114
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,808
STEVE: WE HAD A LOT --

115
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:23,776
>> THEY ALSO SAY --

116
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:25,812
STEVE: LET'S NOT END THIS

117
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:26,145
DEBATE.

118
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:28,548
THERE IS A GENERAL POINT.

119
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:31,784
I LIVE CLOSE TO SAN FRANCISCO.

120
00:04:31,784 --> 00:04:34,220
IT FEELS SHAMING, THE PICTURES

121
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:42,428
WE SAW OF THE HOMELESS

122
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:43,095
ENCAMPMENTS.

123
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:46,566
>> I HAVE A BUSINESS PARTNER AND

124
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:49,902
WE SAID OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY WAS

125
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:50,436
HOMELESSNESS.

126
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:52,238
HE'S GIVEN MORE MONEY TO

127
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:52,638
SCHOOLLESS.

128
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:54,474
THERE ARE MIDDLE-CLASS TAX

129
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:54,807
CREDITS.

130
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:57,109
WE HAVE A CHALLENGE, IF YOU ARE

131
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:59,745
WELL EDUCATED THE SKY IS THE

132
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:00,246
LIMIT.

133
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:02,081
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE MAKE THE

134
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:08,955
ARGUMENT THAT THE HOMELESSNESS

135
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:11,891
PROBLEM IS OF THE HOUSING

136
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,492
PROBLEM.

137
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:13,893
GOVERNOR BROWN HASN'T DONE

138
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:15,094
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

139
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:17,029
IF YOU LOOK AT THE

140
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,331
TRANSPORTATION COST AND COST OF

141
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:21,234
LIVING IT'S UNAFFORDABLE.

142
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:22,902
>> HOUSING IS A LOCAL ISSUE.

143
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:25,972
I WAS A VETERAN AND SEVERED IN

144
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,340
VIETNAM.

145
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,477
18% REDUCTION OF VIETNAM

146
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:33,145
HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE

147
00:05:33,145 --> 00:05:35,548
AN EFFORT IN THE CITY AND

148
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:37,049
COUNTY.

149
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:38,784
>> HOMELESSNESS IS A CULTURE IN

150
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:40,419
CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULARLY.

151
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:43,322
I MOVED HERE FROM TEXAS.

152
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:47,994
I'VE NEVER SEEN A PLACE EMBRACE

153
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:48,427
HOMELESSNESS.

154
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:50,129
SOME PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T

155
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:51,130
AFFORD CALIFORNIA.

156
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,668
THEY ARE TRULY EMPROVE

157
00:05:55,668 --> 00:06:04,076
THEY ARE TRULY IMPROVE ISSUED.

158
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:07,313
IMPROVE ISSUED.

159
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:09,048
ISHED.

160
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:10,449
YOU CAN'T THROW MORE MONEY AT

161
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:11,183
THE PROBLEM.

162
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:13,786
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOUSING

163
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:15,621
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

164
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:18,124
WHY STACK ON MORE REGULATIONS.

165
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:21,594
>> YES, THAT'S A REALLY GOOD

166
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:22,128
POINT.

167
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:23,930
IT'S SO EXPENSIVE TO BUILD A

168
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,031
HOUSE HERE.

169
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,800
YOU COMPARE IT TO HOUSTON WHERE

170
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:37,543
YOU HAVE DIFFERENT ZONING.

171
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:39,312
>> CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL

172
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:40,413
QUALITY ACT.

173
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:42,615
YOU CAN LIVE-IN SAN FRANCISCO

174
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:44,951
AND COME UP WITH A HOUSING

175
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:48,487
PROJECT IN L.A.  IF WE COULD

176
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:53,326
HAVE AN EXCEPTION FOR SPORTS

177
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:55,161
ARENAS WE COULD STOP

178
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:55,661
HOMELESSNESS.

179
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:58,331

GOVERNOR --

181
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:00,633
STEVE: HE HAS HAD TWO TERMS.

182
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,435
THIS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM.

183
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,070
DON'T YOU THINK HE SHOULD HAVE

184
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,671
DONE MORE.

185
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:07,206

TO CHANGE OUR LAWS --

189
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:16,582
STEVE: THE ENVIRONMENTAL.

190
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:17,950
>> THE PROBLEM IS SO MANY PEOPLE

191
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:24,223
