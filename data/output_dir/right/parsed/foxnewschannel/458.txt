MARK: HELLO, AMERICA.
I AM MARKET WITHIN.
WE HAVE A GREAT GUEST FROM
KENTUCKY.
>> IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE.
YOU ARE.
MARK: YOU ARE UNIQUELY QUALIFIED
TO TALK ABOUT THE ELECTION GIVEN
YOUR BACKGROUND AND WANT TO TALK
BRIEFLY ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND
WILL JUMP RIGHT IN.
FIRST OFF, FIRST OFFICE YOU EVER
HELD WAS GOVERNOR OF KENTUCKY.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
MARK: THE FIRST --
>> HE ENTIRE AND THAT HE DID.
I WANT TO GET IN WITH THIS IN A
MOMENT.
MARK: YOU ELECTED THE 62nd
GOVERNOR OF KENTUCKY 2013.
NOT MANY REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS OF
KENTUCKY IN MODERN TIMES?
>> NO, I MAY BE LIKE THE FOURTH
OR SO IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS.
MARK: YOU GREW UP WITH FAMILY,
LIVED IN A FARMHOUSE IN DIRT FO
FOR, BASED ON WHAT I READ.
>> WE WERE FINANCIALLY HUMBLE.
THAT IS CERTAINLY BELOW THE
POVERTY LEVEL.
MARK: YOU GREW UP ON A FARM,
RAISE CROPS AND LIVESTOCK IN YOU
HAD PARENTS WHO INSTILLED IN YOU
FAMILY AND FAITH.
YOU ATTENDED WASHINGTON AND LEE
UNIVERSITY IN VIRGINIA AND ROTC
SCHOLARSHIP AND UPON GRADUATION
FROM ACTIVE DUTY IN THE '90s
ARMY AS AN OFFICER.
YOU LEFT THE SERVICE HAVING
ACHIEVED THE RANK OF CAPTAIN.
YOU FOUNDED SEVERAL COMPANIES IN
KENTUCKY AND INVESTED IN A
NUMBER OF OTHERS IN THE
COMMONWEALTH AS WELL AS OTHER
STATES AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THIS ELECTION.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND CIRCLE
BACK TO YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE AND
HOW YOU BECAME GOVERNOR.
IT'S NOT A STRAIGHT LINE.
IN A TOUGH STATE AND THE KEEP
TALKING ABOUT THIS BLUE WAVE.
AND SOME OF THE EARLY
INDICATIONS ARE THERE IS GOING
TO BE OR MAYBE SOME KIND OF BLUE
WAVE AND YOU ARE A MAN OF
GOVERNMENT IN HISTORY AND
POLITICS SO WHAT YOU SEE
HAPPENING HERE?
>> I AM A STUDENT OF HISTORY.
I GREW UP IN A HOME WITH NO
TELEVISION SO WE DID READ A LOT
AND ALWAYS BEEN INTELLECTUALLY
CURIOUS ABOUT A VARIETY OF
THINGS.
I LOOK AT STATISTICS AND THEY
SEEM TO STICK IN MY HEAD AND I
DO KNOW THIS.
IN MODERN TIMES THEY'RE ONLY
BEEN TWICE WHEN THERE WAS NOT A
MIDTERM SHIFT IN POWER.
IT IS THE NORM AND WOULD BE
UNUSUAL IF THE DEMOCRATS DID NOT
TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE.
IN FACT, THE AVERAGE HAS BEEN 31
SEATS IN EACH OF THE MIDTERM
ELECTIONS THAT HAVE CHANGED
PARTIES.
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A 24C LEAD,
I BELIEVE, WHICH WOULD IMPLY
THEIR SEVEN SEATS DOWN.
STATISTICALLY, HISTORICALLY IT'S
A GIVEN THAT THEY WILL LOSE THE
HOUSE.
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN TWO TIMES
WHEN THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.
I TRULY DO BELIEVE THIS WILL BE
THE THIRD TIME.
WE ARE IN -- THE PARADIGM HAS
SHIFTED.
WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT TIME AND
FOR PEOPLE WITH ALL THE
NARRATIVE WE GET IN WHAT PASSES
FOR MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND I SAY
THAT NOT PEJORATIVELY BUT THEY
WOULD CALL THEMSELVES,
TRADITIONAL MEDIA, WOULD HAVE US
BELIEVE THAT THIS PERSON WHO IS
NOW THE PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP,
IS NOT EVEN REALLY THE PRESENT
AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN HAD
NO CHANCE AND DOES NOT DESERVE
TO BE THERE AND ONE STEP AWAY
FROM BEING IMPEACHED.
THIS NARRATIVE THEY WOULD HAVE
US BELIEVE IS NOT REALLY
CONNECTED TO WHAT THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE BELIEVE OR HE WOULD NOT
HAVE GOTTEN 307 ELECTORAL VOTES.
THE HOPING THAT THERE IS AN
APPETITE FOR WHAT HE'S BEEN
DOING THAT IS NOT EVIDENT BASED
ON POLLING OR WHAT PEOPLE ARE
SAYING OR WHAT YARD SIGNS OR
BUMPER STICKERS ARE OUT THERE
JUST AS IT IS NOT EVIDENT IN
2060 THIS WILL BE THE THIRD
TIME.
WILL THE REPUBLICANS LOSE SEATS?
YES THEY WILL.
IT WILL BE SHOCKING IF THEY DO
NOT BUT THEY WILL LOSE SEATS.
WILL THEY LOSE 31?
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
WILL THEY LOSE EVEN 25?
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
THE VOTERS WILL DECIDE.
EVERY DISTRICT IS DIFFERENT.
THE LEVEL OF RESENTMENT THAT HAS
HELD BY A HANDFUL IS NOT
WIDESPREAD AMONG THE PEOPLE AND
I TRULY BELIEVE THE PEOPLE ARE
GRATEFUL FOR THE PRESIDENT AND
HIS WILLINGNESS TO SHAKE THINGS
UP AND WILLINGNESS TO DELIVER ON
PROMISES HE MADE.
HE IS DOING -- PEOPLE MAY OR MAY
NOT LIKE THE METHODOLOGY BUT YOU
CAN'T ARGUE WITH THE RESULTS.
HE IS SOMEONE WHO IS EXITING
LIKE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE
PRECEDED HIM IN WHAT HE RAN ON.
THAT'S A REFRESHING CHANGE OF
PACE FOR AMERICA.
MARK: THESE NEWS REPORTS TALK
ABOUT HOW THE DEMOCRAT BASE IS
ALL FIRED UP.
AND HOW THE REPUBLICAN BASE IS
RELATIVELY PASSIVE.
I'M STARTING TO SEE A CHANGE IN
THIS.
THERE IS POTENTIAL BACKLASH THAT
THE MEDIA ARE SO ONE-SIDED AND
SO OVER-THE-TOP THAT THE
DEMOCRATS WHETHER HEARINGS FOR
WHAT EVER IS TAKING PLACE THE
ATTACKS ON TED CRUZ AND OTHER
CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS
WHO SERVE IN THE ADMINISTRATION
AT RESTAURANTS AND SO FORTH, YOU
REALLY THINK THERE'S A
RELATIVELY SILENT MAJORITY SO
CALL THAT OUT THERE THAT WILL
SHOW UP IN THE MIDTERM ELECTION?
>> NO WAY I WOULD BE THE
GOVERNOR.
NO WAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT IF THAT
MAJORITY DID NOT EXIST AND WOULD
NOT BE POSSIBLE.
I DO NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE
PARTY OR POWERS THAT BE OR ANY
PARTICULAR POLITICAL ASSESSMENT
NOR DID HE.
IN FACT I WAS IN A MORE
MICROCOSMIC LEVEL IN KENTUCKY
AND A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM IN
WAYS THAT UNNERVE PEOPLE BECAUSE
WHO WAS I?
I WAS SOMEONE WHO DID NOT HAVE
NOT KISSED THE RIGHT WINGS FOR
BACKSIDES OR WAITED IN LINE OR
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE AND
HE'S DONE THE SAME THING.
AMERICA IS HUNGRY FOR THIS.
AMERICA IS NOT A FOOL THAT SO
MANY IN THE POLITICAL RANKS
WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT WE
ARE.
THAT IS THE GREATNESS OF
AMERICA.
PEOPLE ARE, AT THE END OF THE
DAY, NOT EASILY FOOLED.
I TRULY BELIEVE THERE IS A
HUNGER FOR CONTINUATION OF THE
PATH WE ARE ON WHICH AMERICA
STANDING FIRMLY FOR LIFE,
LIBERTY AND THE THINGS THAT THE
SHOW IS HERE TO DISCUSS.
THESE ARE THE FOUNDATIONAL
TENETS UPON WHICH THIS NATION
WAS BUILT.
IT'S REFRESHING WHEN WE HAVE A
LEADER IN WASHINGTON WHO
BELIEVES THIS TO HIS CORE.
MARK: YOU MENTIONED THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES.
WHAT ABOUT THE STATE SENATE?
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAP THE
REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE WINNING A
WHOLE BUNCH OF SEATS.
REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE AND
HOUSE ARE NOT DELIVERED ON A LOT
OF THEIR PROMISES.
THE PRESIDENT HAS.
BUT SPENDING IS UP, THAT IS WAY
OUT BUT THEY'VE DONE GOOD
THINGS.
NOT AN ADDITIONAL PENNY FOR THE
LOSS OF THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING
VERY AGGRESSIVELY TO GET TAKING
CARE OF.
HOW DO YOU SEE THE SENATE IN THE
SELECTION?
GOVERNOR BEVIN: I WOULD BE
SHOCKED IF THEY DID NOT PICK UP
ONE OR TWO SEATS.
YOU ARE CORRECT IN A DIFFERENT
ENVIRONMENT, WITH A DIFFERENT
SENSE OF MOTIVATION IN A
DIFFERENT SENSE OF URGENCY
PERHAPS BUT THE REASONS FOR WHY
WE'RE NOT GETTING THE THINGS WE
COULD LAY DIRECTIONAL BLAME IN
ANY DIRECTION.
WE MIGHT PICK UP FIVE, SIX OR
SEVEN.
TRUTHFULLY, WITH FAR MORE
POTENTIAL PICKUPS AND WE HAVE
SEATS TO DEFEND AS A PUBLICANS.
I SAY THIS AS A REPUBLICAN.
I THINK WE COULD PICK UP ONE OR
TWO PRETTY EASILY.
I'D BE SHOCKED IF WE DIDN'T COME
OUT WITH 53, 54 SEATS IN THE
SENATE.
MARK: SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
ON ELECTION NIGHT THE FIRST
TUESDAY NIGHT IN NOVEMBER, WE
ALL WATCH TELEVISION OR LISTEN
TO THE RADIO AND THE SAME PEOPLE
WERE SHOCKED AT DONALD TRUMP'S
VICTORY WILL BE SHOCKED AT WHAT
HAPPENED IN THE MIDTERM
ELECTION.
GOVERNOR BEVIN: I BELIEVE SO.
IT BECOMES THIS FALSE NARRATIVE
THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON HAS
BEEN PREDETERMINED IN THE MINDS
OF SOME AND TRY TO WILL IT INTO
PERDITION BY TALKING ABOUT IT
NONSTOP AS IF IT'S A FOREGONE
CONCLUSION.
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WITH IN
THE INSULATED WORLD THAT THEY
HAVE THE CONVERSATION IT SOUNDS
GOOD AND NO ONE DISAGREES
BECAUSE THEY ALL WANT THE FALSE
NARRATIVE TO COME TRUE BUT THE
HEARTLAND IN PLACES LIKE
KENTUCKY PEOPLE AREN'T READING
"THE WASHINGTON POST" AND NOT
READING "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND
THEY DON'T GIVE A RIP ABOUT WHAT
SOME PERSON IN DC THANKS ABOUT
THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE.
THEY DON'T.
WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT ARE THE
SAME THINGS THEY HAVE ALWAYS
CARED ABOUT.
THEY CARE ABOUT THE SECURITY OF
THEIR FAMILIES, THE PHYSICAL
SECURITY AND THE FINANCIAL
SECURITY.
THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR WALLETS
AND WHETHER THE MONEY THEY EARN
IS ABLE TO BE KEPT AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE BY THEMSELVES AND TO
THE EXTENT IT'S NOT WHAT THE
GOVERNMENT DOES IT IS USEFUL AND
PRODUCTIVE.
THESE ARE SIMPLE THINGS.
WE ARE SIMPLE PEOPLE.
WE'RE NOT EASILY FOOLED AND NOT
IDIOTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE
WANT SIMPLE THINGS IN OUR LIVES.
WE WANT FAMILIES TO LIVE IN
FREEDOM AND WE WANT AS LITTLE
GOVERNMENT IN OUR LIVES AS
POSSIBLE.
I WEAR THIS BUTTON, IT'S A PAIR
OF SCISSORS CUTTING THROUGH RED
TAPE, IT'S AN INDICATION PEOPLE
ON MY TEAM WEAR THIS.
I PLEDGED WHEN I WAS ELECTED I
WOULD CUT 30% OF ALL REGULATION
IN OUR STATE IN OVER THREE YEARS
BUT WE ARE WELL UNDERWAY TO
DOING THAT.
PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS IS GOING TO
COMPROMISE OUR SAFETY AND
SECURITY IN ENVIRONMENT BUT
NONSENSE.
STILL 100,000 RULES TELLING US
WHAT WE CAN OR CANNOT DO.
AMERICANS ARE FED UP WITH THIS.
NO ONE WANTS A DIRTY ENVIRONMENT
OR DIRTY AIR OR UNSAFE BEACH OR
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE BUT
THEY'RE INCREASINGLY LESS
CONVINCED THAT MORE GOVERNMENT
RULES ARE THE ANSWER TO GIVE
THEM LIBERTY THAT THEY WERE
INNATELY CREATED TO CRAVE AND
THAT WE BEEN BLESSED IN THIS
NATION TO HAVE SUCH AN ABUNDANCE
THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO TAKE IT
FOR GRANTED.
I'VE ASKED MY BIGGEST THREAT TO
AMERICA WAS AND I THINK IT'S OUR
APATHY.
THE FACT YOU'RE SO BLESSED THAT
WE CAN AFFORD TO NOT CARE.
WE HAVE IT SO GOOD THAT WE CAN
AFFORD TO NOT CARE AND CONVINCED
OUR QUALITY OF LIFE IS NOT
LIKELY TO CHANGE.
EVERY CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION
SINCE THE DAWN OF MAN SCRIBBLED
FROM WITHIN EXTERIOR WARS, WAS
MUNITIONS IN CAPITALS AND
BORDERS.
BUT WORST NOT DESTROY CULTURES.
WORDS DO NOT DESTROY
CIVILIZATIONS.
THOSE ARE DESTROYED FROM WITHIN
DUE TO COMPLACENCY AND APATHY.
MARK: BEYOND THE PRESIDENCY AND
ELECTION, DO YOU THINK WERE
BEGINNING TO CRUMBLE FROM
WITHIN?
GOVERNOR BEVIN: NO DOUBT.
I WROTE A LETTER BACK FROM YEARS
AGO TO SOMEONE IN THE
FAITH-BASED IMMUNITY ENTITLED
WHERE ARE THE DANIELS?
THIS IS BEFORE I THREW MY HAT
INTO THE POLITICAL ARENA THIS
WAS THE ONE AS A FATHER,
VETERAN, HUSBAND, TAXPAYING
EMPLOYER OF OTHER PEOPLE,
SOMEONE WHO IS LIKE SO MANY OF
YOUR VIEWERS THOSE OUT THERE
LIVING MY LIFE AND I LOOKED
AROUND THE LANDSCAPE AND SAID
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
WE BECOME NUMB AND AGAIN, IT'S
NOT TO PICK ON I'M A BIG
BELIEVER IN TERM LIMITS.
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.
THE GOOD COMES FROM COMPLACENCY
WHETHER IT'S A BUSINESS OR
GOVERNMENT OR CHURCH, PICK THE
CATEGORY, IF PEOPLE COME TO A
CUSTOM TO ANY ONE THING FOR TOO
LONG IT USUALLY DOES NOT RESULT
IN A BETTER ENVIRONMENT.
TO THAT END I LOOKED AROUND AND
SAID AMERICA IS GETTING SOFT IN
THE UNDERBELLY IS GETTING SOFT.
I DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT THIS.
I WROTE THIS LETTER AND SAID
WHERE ARE THE DANIELS?
WHERE THE PEOPLE FROM AMONG US,
NORMAL PEOPLE, BUT ARE WILLING
TO RISE UP AND GIVE MODERN
EQUIVALENT OF DEFIANCE TO THE
KING AND SAY THIS IS NOT
ACCEPTABLE AND THIS IS NOT WHO
WE ARE IN THESE ARE NOT THE
VALUES THAT WE HOLD.
THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING OF
CONCERN FOR SOME TIME.
YOU OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE IN
POLITICS TALK ABOUT HOW HER AT A
CROSSROADS.
I WOULD BEG TO DIFFER ONLY IN
THIS RESPECT.
IN RECENT YEARS WE SAW IN 2016
AND WE ARE STILL THERE IT'S MORE
OF A FORK IN THE ROAD.
LET'S TAKE CROSSROADS -- THAT
IMPLIES OPTIONS THAT FORK IN THE
ROAD YOU GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
IN AMERICA IS STILL BUT HAD VERY
MUCH IN RECENT YEARS BEEN AT
THIS FORK IN THE ROAD.
WE WILL DOG LIKE HARD TO THE
LEFT IN A WAY THAT MAY HAVE NOT
BEEN POSSIBLE TO RETURN FROM
WORK GO TO THE RIGHT.
MARK: WHEN WE COME BACK HOME AND
ASK YOU WHAT SHOULD THESE WILL
BEGIN BE RUNNING ON?
YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE AND RAN
AS A CONSERVATIVE AND HE FOUGHT
