DIANE: POMPEO PREPARING FOR AROUND 2 OF MEETINGS WITH ONE OF KIM JONG UN'S CLOSEST CONFIDENCE IN NEW YORK CITY AS THE WHITE HOUSE FIGHTS TO SAVE THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT. WHAT DO THESE TOXIC KNOW FOR THE HOPE OF RESURRECTING THE JUNE 12TH MEETING? HERE TO WEIGH IN IS THE AUTHOR OF THE REAPER, GHOST TARGET AND FORMER DEPUTY COMMANDING GENERAL OF US FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN, GENERAL ANTHONY TATUM. WE APPRECIATE IT. THIS IS THE HIGHEST-RANKING NORTH KOREAN OFFICIAL THAT NATION TO VISIT THE US SINCE THE YEAR 2000. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS? ALMOST EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT AS SECRETARY POMPEO GOING TO PYONGYANG AND A SHOW OF REAL SERIOUSNESS, AND NOT THE ONLY MEETING TAKING PLACE, AND THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE DISCUSSING INTRICATE DETAILS OF DENUCLEARIZATION AND OTHER MEETINGS IN SINGAPORE WORKING OUT LOGISTICS AND BETWEEN THESE THREE MEETINGS, SECRETARY POMPEO, THE HIGHEST LEVEL MEETING AND PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT AND ALL OF THAT WILL BE COMMUNICATED DURING THAT TO DONALD TRUMP. WHAT THE MEETING IS ABOUT IS SIGNALING A GO OR NO GO DECISION TO THE PRESIDENT. HE IS GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT NORTH KOREANS ARE READY TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS AND DENUCLEARIZE. WHETHER THEY ARE SERIOUS, DONALD TRUMP HAS SHOWN HE IS READY TO STEP AWAY FROM IT IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THROUGH ON WHAT HE BELIEVES THEY NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF DENUCLEARIZATION LOSE THEIR DINNER WAS STEAK, CORN AND CHEESE. WE WILL SEE HOW THEY GO WITH THAT. WHEN IN TERMS OF OPTIONS DOES NORTH KOREA HAVE IN TERMS OF DENUCLEARIZATION? CAN WE GO THROUGH SOME OF THE OPTIONS, POSSIBILITIES AND BEGIN WITH HANDING OVER SOME NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND HE MENTIONED LIBYA BECAUSE OF HANDING OVER THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN ADVANCE. LIBYA OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY, AND CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING. YOU DON'T WANT TO SEND THE WRONG SIGNAL WITH WHOM YOU ARE NEGOTIATING. THERE IS NO OTHER COUNTRY LIKE NORTH KOREA, THE HERMIT KINGDOM. THEY TESTED 6 NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THEY HAVE PRETTY EXTENSIVE INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILE CAPABILITY VERY DIFFERENT FROM LIBYA. THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMMEDIATELY TURN OVER SOME NUKES RIGHT AWAY, TAKE A PHASED APPROACH, THEN FREEZE ALL TESTING. THROUGH THE PHASED APPROACH CONTINUE TO DENUCLEARIZE AND ALLOW TRANSPARENT INSPECTIONS AND THAT IS WHAT I THINK POMPEO TALKS ARE ALL ABOUT RIGHT NOW AND IT IS WISE OF THE PRES. TO HAVE THESE TALKS GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. KIM JONG UN WAS RUMORED TO BE EDUCATED IN THE WEST, IN SWITZERLAND AND CAME TO POWER WITH TWO VISIONS. ONE IS A POWERFUL NUCLEAR ARSENAL. THE OTHER IS A MIGHTY ECONOMY. HE DOES NOT HAVE EITHER BUT HE MAY BE WILLING TO TRADE THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL TO ENHANCE THE ECONOMY. THE SAME PEOPLE, MANY FAMILIES ARE DIVIDED BY THE 38TH PARALLEL. THE SAME WORK ETHIC IS IN THE NORTH AS THE SOUTH BUT THEY NEED PROPER LEADERSHIP. HEATHER: OBVIOUSLY WE LEARNED THE LESSON WITH IRAN, WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUT A LOT OF MONEY UP FRONT. THE OPPORTUNITY IS WHAT YOU REALLY HAVE IS A COUNTRY THAT NEEDS MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. WHAT THE UNITED STATES CAN DO IS SAY YOU CAME TO POWER WANTING TWO THINGS, NUKES AND A STRONG ECONOMY. TAKE THE NUKES OFF, TRADE THAT AWAY. IT WILL HELP WITH YOUR STRONG ECONOMY. YOUR PARTNER TO THE SOUTH AND THESE TALKS MAY BE ABOUT REUNIFICATION. IT IS A BIGGER PICTURE FOR ME THAN JUST DENUCLEARIZATION. THERE IS A HOLISTIC DISCUSSION ABOUT REUNIFICATION. HEATHER: THAT BRINGS UP ANOTHER ISSUE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BRING
