4
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:06,495
TRACE?

5
00:00:06,495 --> 00:00:09,465
>> THIS IS THE EPA'S NATIONAL

6
00:00:09,465 --> 00:00:14,337
SUMMIT ON HARMFUL WATER

7
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:18,107
CONTAMINANTS LINKED TO WATER.

8
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:20,776
JOURNALISTS FROM CNN, ASSOCIATED

9
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:24,513
PRESS, WERE NOT ALLOWED INSIDE.

10
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:26,649
A.P. SAYS ITS REPORTER WAS NOT

11
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:27,950
ONLY DENIED ENTRY, BUT GRABBED

00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,385
BY SECURITY AND FORCIBLY SHOVED

13
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:31,954
OUT OF THE BUILDING.

14
00:00:31,954 --> 00:00:33,255
THE EPA DIDN'T COMMENT ABOUT

15
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:35,024
ANYONE PHYSICALLY REMOVING A

16
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:36,192
JOURNALIST, BUT SAID THE PLAN

17
00:00:36,192 --> 00:00:37,693
WAS TO ALLOW 10 REPORTERS

18
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:38,994
INSIDE, SAYING, QUOTING, THIS

19
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:41,230
WAS SIMPLY AN ISSUE OF THE ROOM

20
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,498
REACHING CAPACITY, WHICH

21
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:44,934
REPORTERS WERE AWARE OF PRIOR TO

22
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:45,468
THE EVENT.

23
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:48,504
A REPORT BY THE HILL SAID THAT

24
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:49,905
DURING THE CONFERENCE, A HANDFUL

25
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:53,275

26
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:54,577
ANOTHER REPORTER TOLD POLITICO

27
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:55,945
THERE WERE DOZENS OF EMPTY

28
00:00:55,945 --> 00:00:57,480
SEATS, AND CNN ALSO SHOWED

29
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,382
PICTURES OF SPACE FOR CAMERAS.

30
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:01,150
FOR THE RECORD, FOX NEWS WAS NOT

31
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,450
THERE.

32
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,018
INSTEAD WE DECIDED TO USE THE

33
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:05,120
POOL CAMERA, WHICH WAS PROVIDED

34
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,422

38
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:12,361
CNN SAID, QUOTING, WE UNDERSTAND

39
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:13,763
THE IMPORTANCE OF AN OPEN AND

40
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:16,065
FREE PRESS, AND WE HOPE THE EPA

41
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:16,899
DOES TOO.

42
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:18,934
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS CALLED IT,

43
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:20,503
QUOTE, ALARMING AND A DIRECT

44
00:01:20,503 --> 00:01:23,839
THREAT TO THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO

45
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:27,143
KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S INSIDE THEIR

46
00:01:27,143 --> 00:01:27,777
GOVERNMENT.

47
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:30,079
ANOTHER SAID THE TOPIC WAS

48
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,480
CRITICAL TO THEIR READERS, AND

49
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,782
OUR REPORTER DESERVED TO BE IN

50
00:01:32,782 --> 00:01:35,351
THAT ROOM TO ASK SMART QUESTIONS

51
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:37,286
OF EPA OFFICIALS.

52
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:38,454

SARAH SANDERS FIRST SAID SHE

54
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,992
WOULD LOOK INTO THE MATTER, AND

55
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:44,493
THEN EVER ASKED IF IT'S

56
00:01:44,493 --> 00:01:46,896
ACCEPTABLE TO PHYSICALLY TURN

57
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:47,596
AWAY REPORTERS.

58
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:47,897
WATCH.

59
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:51,200
>> I'M NOT GOING TO WEIGH INTO

60
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,336
RANDOM HYPOTHETICALS THAT MAY OR

61
00:01:54,336 --> 00:02:04,613
MAY NOT EXIST.

62
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:07,583
MAY NOT EXIST.

63
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,318
>> WE SHOULD NOTE ALL THE

64
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:11,821
REPORTERS WERE ALLOWED INTO THE

65
00:02:11,821 --> 00:00:00,000
