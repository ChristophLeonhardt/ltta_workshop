1
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:15,610
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of
Congress, my fellow Americans: tonight marks

2
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:22,560
the eighth year that I’ve come here to report
on the state of the Union.

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:31,689
And for this final one, I’m going to try
to make it a little shorter.

4
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:36,240
I know some of you are antsy to get back to
Iowa.

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,410
I’ve been there.

6
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:51,490
I’ll be shaking hands afterwards if you
want some tips.

7
00:00:51,490 --> 00:01:00,930
Now, I understand that because it’s an election
season, expectations for what we will achieve

8
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,949
this year are low.

9
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:08,509
But, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive
approach that you and other leaders took at

10
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:14,080
the end of last year to pass a budget and
make tax cuts permanent for working families.

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,820
So I hope we can work together this year on
some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice

12
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:29,530
reform, and helping 
people who are battling prescription drug

13
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,310
abuse and heroin abuse.

14
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,050
So who knows.

15
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:42,000
We might surprise the cynics again.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,229
But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional
list of proposals for the year ahead.

17
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:54,660
Don’t worry, I’ve got plenty, from helping
students learn to write computer code to personalizing

18
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,590
medical treatments for patients.

19
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:02,470
And I will keep pushing for progress on the
work that I believe still needs to be done:

20
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,960
fixing a broken immigration system...

21
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:16,930
... protecting our kids from gun violence,
equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising

22
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,720
the minimum wage.

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:28,490
All these things — all these things still
matter to hardworking families.

24
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:35,030
They’re still the right thing to do, and
I won’t let up until they get done.

25
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,410
But for my final address to this chamber,
I don’t want to just talk about next year.

26
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:47,510
I want to focus on the next five years, the
next ten years and beyond.

27
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:54,990
I want to focus on our future.

28
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:01,180
We live in a time of extraordinary change
— change that’s reshaping the way we live,

29
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,460
the way we work, our planet, our place in
the world.

30
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,380
It’s change that promises amazing medical
breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions

31
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,940
that strain working families.

32
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:21,930
It promises education for girls in the most
remote villages, but also connects terrorists,

33
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,500
plotting an ocean away.

34
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:32,280
It’s change that can broaden opportunity,
or widen inequality.

35
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:40,400
And whether we like it or not, the pace of
this change will only accelerate.

36
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:48,380
America has been through big changes before
— wars and depression, the influx of new

37
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:58,000
immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal,
movements to expand civil rights.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,680
Each time, there have been those who told
us to fear the future, who claimed we could

39
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,950
slam the brakes on change, who promised to
restore past glory if we just got some group

40
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,690
or idea that was threatening America under
control.

41
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:24,320
And each time, we overcame those fears.We
did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to

42
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,510
the dogmas of the quiet past.

43
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,740
Instead we thought anew and acted anew.

44
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:43,690
We made change work for us, always extending
America’s promise outward, to the next frontier,

45
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,100
to more people.

46
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:56,060
And because we did, because we saw opportunity
where others saw peril, we emerged stronger

47
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:02,430
and better than before.

48
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,960
What was true then can be true now.

49
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:19,410
Our unique strengths as a nation — our optimism
and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our

50
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:28,520
diversity, our commitment to rule of law — these
things give us everything we need to ensure

51
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,630
prosperity and security for generations to
come.

52
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:42,980
In fact, it’s in that spirit that we have
made the progress these past seven years.

53
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:51,930
That’s how we recovered from the worst economic
crisis in generations.

54
00:05:51,930 --> 00:06:06,100
That’s how we reformed our health care system
and reinvented our energy sector.

55
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:14,460
That’s how — that’s how we — that’s
how we delivered more care and benefits to

56
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,139
our troops coming home and our veterans.

57
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:39,190
That’s how we — that’s — that’s
how we secured the freedom in every state

58
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:54,250
to marry the person we love.

59
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,380
But such progress is not inevitable.

60
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:04,919
It’s the result of choices we make together.

61
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,160
And we face such choices right now.

62
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:18,810
Will we respond to the changes of our time
with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning

63
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,570
against each other as a people?

64
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:29,410
Or will we face the future with confidence
in who we are, in what we stand for, and the

65
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,880
incredible things we can do together?

66
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,020
So let’s talk about the future, and four
big questions that I believe we as a country

67
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:49,360
have to answer, regardless of who the next
president is or who controls the next Congress.

68
00:07:49,360 --> 00:08:01,540
First, how do we give everyone a fair shot
at opportunity and security in this new economy?

69
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:11,860
Second, how do we make technology work for
us, and not against us, especially when it

70
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,910
comes to solving urgent challenges like climate
change?

71
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:31,960
Third, how do we keep America safe and lead
the world without becoming its policeman?

72
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:41,260
And finally, how can we make our politics
reflect what’s best in us, and not what’s

73
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,670
worst?

74
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:58,129
Let me start with the economy and a basic
fact.

75
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:06,309
The United States of America, right now, has
the strongest, most durable economy in the

76
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:08,410
world.

77
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:28,800
We’re in the middle of the longest streak
of private-sector job creation in history.More

78
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:36,300
than 14 million new jobs, the strongest two
years of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment

79
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,410
rate cut in half.

80
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:47,959
Our auto industry just had its best year ever.

81
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:55,679
That’s just part of a manufacturing surge
that’s created nearly 900,000 new jobs in

82
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,470
the past six years.

83
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:11,800
And we’ve done all this while cutting our
deficits by almost three-quarters.

84
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:19,980
Anyone claiming that America’s economy is
in decline is peddling fiction.

85
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,000
Now...

86
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,689
What is true — and the reason that a lot
of Americans feel anxious — is that the

87
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:36,540
economy has been changing in profound ways,
changes that started long before the Great

88
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,470
Recession hit, changes that have not let up.

89
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:49,149
Today, technology doesn’t just replace jobs
on the assembly line, but any job where work

90
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,939
can be automated.

91
00:10:52,939 --> 00:11:00,829
Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere,
and they face tougher competition.

92
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:04,630
As a result, workers have less leverage for
a raise.

93
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,720
Companies have less loyalty to their communities.

94
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:15,949
And more and more wealth and income is concentrated
at the very top.

95
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:24,220
All these trends have squeezed workers, even
when they have jobs, even when the economy

96
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,929
is growing.

97
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:32,029
It’s made it harder for a hardworking family
to pull itself out of poverty, harder for

98
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:40,649
young people to start their careers, tougher
for workers to retire when they want to.

99
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:46,850
And although none of these trends are unique
to America, they do offend our uniquely American

100
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:54,569
belief that everybody who works hard should
get a fair shot.

101
00:11:54,569 --> 00:12:02,439
For the past seven years, our goal has been
a growing economy that also works better for

102
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:03,470
everybody.

103
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:10,920
We’ve made progress, but we need to make
more.

104
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,680
And despite all the political arguments that
we’ve had these past few years, there are

105
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,589
actually some areas where Americans broadly
agree.

106
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:25,929
We agree that real opportunity requires every
American to get the education and training

107
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:29,940
they need to land a good-paying job.

108
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,160
The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind
was an important start, and together, we’ve

109
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,350
increased early childhood education, lifted
high school graduation rates to new highs,

110
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,670
boosted graduates in fields like engineering.

111
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,529
In the coming years, we should build on that
progress, by providing Pre-K for all and offering

112
00:12:50,529 --> 00:13:05,149
every student...

113
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:10,239
... offering every student the hands-on computer
science and math classes that make them job-ready

114
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:12,350
on day one.

115
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:23,610
We should recruit and support more great teachers
for our kids.

116
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:41,069
And — and we have to make college affordable
for every American.

117
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:44,060
No hardworking student should be stuck in
the red.

118
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:50,619
We’ve already reduced student loan payments
by — to 10 percent of a borrower’s income.

119
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:51,619
And that’s good.

120
00:13:51,619 --> 00:14:00,259
But now we’ve actually got to cut the cost
of college.

121
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:05,231
Providing two years of community college at
no cost for every responsible student is one

122
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:08,589
of the best ways to do that, and I’m going
to keep fighting to get that started this

123
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:10,519
year.

124
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:22,160
It’s the right thing to do.

125
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,649
But a great education isn’t all we need
in this new economy.

126
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:31,819
We also need benefits, and protections that
provide a basic measure of security.

127
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:37,220
It’s not too much of a stretch to say that
some of the only people in America who are

128
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,680
going to work the same job, in the same place
with a health, and a retirement package for

129
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:50,559
30 years are sitting in this chamber.

130
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:57,129
For everyone else, especially folks in their
40’s and 50’s, saving for retirement,

131
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:02,279
or bouncing back from job loss has gotten
a lot tougher.

132
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,440
Americans understand that at some point in
their careers, in this new economy, they may

133
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,160
have to retool, they may have to retrain,
but they shouldn’t lose what they’ve already

134
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,040
worked so hard to build in the process.

135
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,980
That’s why Social Security and Medicare
are more important than ever, we shouldn’t

136
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:36,410
weaken them, we should strengthen them.

137
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:42,870
And for American short of retirement, basic
benefits should be just as mobile as everything

138
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,699
else is today.

139
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,649
That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care
Act is all about.

140
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:55,480
It’s about filling the gaps in employer
based care so that when you lose a job, or

141
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:03,259
you go back to school, or you strike out and
launch that new business you’ll still have

142
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:05,040
coverage.

143
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,399
Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage
so far, and in the process...

144
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:24,739
In the process health care inflation has slowed,
our businesses have created jobs every single

145
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:27,319
month since it became law.

146
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:33,509
Now, I’m guessing we won’t agree on health
care anytime soon.

147
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:40,199
A little applause right there.

148
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,209
Just a guess.

149
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:50,149
But there should be other ways parties can
work together improve economic security.

150
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:58,769
Say a hardworking American loses his job,
we shouldn’t just make sure he can get unemployment

151
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:04,109
insurance; we should make sure that program
encourages him to retrain for a business that’s

152
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,789
ready to hire him.

153
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,859
If that new job doesn’t pay as much, there
should be a system of wage insurance in place

154
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,929
so that he can still pay his bills.

155
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,940
And even if he’s going from job to job,
he should still be able to save for retirement

156
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,200
and take his savings with him.

157
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,460
That’s the way we make the new economy work
better for everybody.

158
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:34,480
I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about
his interest in tackling poverty.

159
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,320
America is about giving everybody willing
to work a chance, a hand up, and I’d welcome

160
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,160
a serious discussion about strategies we can
all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income

161
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:56,740
workers who don’t have children.

162
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,880
But there are some areas where we just have
to be honest.

163
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,800
It has been more difficult to find agreement
over the last seven years, and a lot of them

164
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,230
fall under the category of what role the government
should play in making sure the system’s

165
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,400
not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and
biggest corporations.

166
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,400
And it’s an honest disagreement.

167
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,350
And, the American people have a choice to
make.

168
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:35,030
I believe a thriving private sector is the
lifeblood of our economy.

169
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:41,330
I think there are outdated regulations that
need to be changed, there is red tape that

170
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:49,210
needs to be cut.

171
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:55,120
There you go.

172
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,090
Yes.

173
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,050
See?

174
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:09,490
But after years of record corporate profits,
working families won’t get more opportunity

175
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:15,670
or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks
or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules

176
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:26,340
at everybody else’s expense.

177
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:32,270
Middle-class families are not going to feel
more secure because we allowed attacks on

178
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,520
collective bargaining to go unanswered.

179
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:53,790
Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial
crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.

180
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,210
Immigrants aren’t the principal reason wages
haven’t gone up.

181
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:01,030
Those decisions are made in the boardrooms
that all too often put quarterly earnings

182
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,290
over long-term returns.

183
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:08,300
It’s sure not the average family watching
tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore

184
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,580
accounts.

185
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:19,620
The point is, I believe, that in this new
economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses

186
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,420
need more of a voice, not less.

187
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,190
The rules should work for them.

188
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,440
And...

189
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,140
... I’m not alone in this.

190
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:34,110
This year, I plan to lift up the many businesses
who’ve figured out that doing right by their

191
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:39,830
workers or their customers or their communities
ends up being good for their shareholders...

192
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:54,860
... 

193
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
and I want to spread those best practices
across America.

194
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,860
That’s part of a brighter future.

195
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,970
In fact, it turns out many of our best corporate
citizens are also our most creative.

196
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:07,110
And this brings me to the second big question
we as a country have to answer: how do we

197
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:13,370
reignite that spirit of innovation to meet
our biggest challenges?

198
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:20,310
Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us
into space, we didn’t deny Sputnik was up

199
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,310
there.

200
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:28,420
We didn’t argue about the science, or shrink
our research and development budget.

201
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,290
We built a space program almost overnight,
and twelve years later, we were walking on

202
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:43,340
the moon.

203
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:59,320
Now, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA.

204
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:06,200
America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers
and George Washington Carver.

205
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,130
America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson
and Sally Ride.

206
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,990
America is every immigrant and entrepreneur
from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing

207
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,040
to shape a better future.

208
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:28,420
That’s who we are, and over the past seven
years, we’ve nurtured that spirit.

209
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,800
We’ve protected an open Internet, and taken
bold new steps to get more students and low-income

210
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,270
Americans online.

211
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:42,730
We’ve launched next-generation manufacturing
hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur

212
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,950
everything he or she needs to start a business
in a single day.

213
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,120
But we can do so much more.

214
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:59,800
You know, last year, Vice President Biden
said that, with a new moon-shot, America can

215
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,600
cure cancer.

216
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,250
Last month, he worked with this Congress to
give scientists at the National Institutes

217
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:26,530
of Health the strongest resources that they’ve
had in over 

218
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,530
a decade.

219
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:33,780
Well, so — so tonight, I’m announcing
a new national effort to get it done.

220
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:38,440
And because he’s gone to the mat for all
of us on so many issues over the past 40 years,

221
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,410
I’m putting Joe in charge of mission control.

222
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:50,060
For the loved ones we’ve all lost, for the
families that we can still save, let’s make

223
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,760
America the country that cures cancer once
and for all.

224
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:01,550
What do you think?

225
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:09,340
Let’s make it happen.

226
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,590
And medical research is critical.

227
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:22,350
We need the same level of commitment when
it comes to developing clean energy sources.

228
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:32,460
Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the
science around climate change, have at it.

229
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,660
You will be pretty lonely because you’ll
be debating our military, most of America’s

230
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,970
business leaders, the majority of the American
people, almost the entire scientific community,

231
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:54,550
and 200 nations around the world who agree
it’s a problem and intend to solve it.

232
00:24:54,550 --> 00:25:01,830
But even if — even if the planet wasn’t
at stake, even if 2014 wasn’t the warmest

233
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:10,100
year on record until 2015 turned out even
hotter — why would we want to pass up the

234
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:25,460
chance for American businesses to produce
and sell the energy of the future?

235
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:33,430
Listen, seven years ago, we made the single
biggest investment in clean energy in our

236
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,660
history.

237
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:39,340
Here are the results.

238
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:46,380
In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is
now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power.

239
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,150
On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar
is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars

240
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:58,650
a year on their energy bills and employs more
Americans than coal — in jobs that pay better

241
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,020
than average.

242
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,000
We’re taking steps to give homeowners the
freedom to generate and store their own energy

243
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,810
— something, by the way, that environmentalists
and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support.

244
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:17,600
And meanwhile, we’ve cut our imports of
foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon

245
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:35,150
pollution more than any other country on Earth.

246
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:44,510
Gas under $2 a gallon ain’t bad either.

247
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:53,100
Now we’ve got to accelerate the transition
away from old, dirtier energy sources.

248
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,770
Rather than subsidize the past, we should
invest in the future, especially in communities

249
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,540
that rely on fossil fuels.

250
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,280
We do them no favor when we don’t show them
where the trends are going.

251
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:10,510
And that’s why I’m going to push to change
the way we manage our oil and coal resources

252
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:15,180
so that they better reflect the costs they
impose on taxpayers and our planet.

253
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:21,520
And that way, we put money back into those
communities and put tens of thousands of Americans

254
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:31,170
to work building a 21st century transportation
system.

255
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:45,280
Now, none of this is going to happen overnight,
and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests

256
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,680
who want to protect the status quo.

257
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:56,240
But the jobs we’ll create, the money we’ll
save, the planet we’ll preserve, that is

258
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,770
the kind of future our kids and our grandkids
deserve.

259
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,220
And it’s within our grasp.

260
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:08,000
Now, climate change is just one of many issues
where our security is linked to the rest of

261
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,520
the world, and that’s why the third big
question that we have to answer together is

262
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:22,530
how to keep America safe and strong without
either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-

263
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,090
build everywhere there’s a problem.

264
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:32,500
I told you earlier all the talk of America’s
economic decline is political hot air.

265
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,670
Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about
our enemies getting stronger and America getting

266
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,670
weaker.

267
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,960
Let me tell you something.

268
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:57,500
The United States of America is the most powerful
nation on Earth, period.

269
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,320
Period.

270
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,900
It’s not even close.

271
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,900
It’s not even close.

272
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,900
It’s not even close.

273
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,670
We spend more on our military than the next
eight nations combined.

274
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:36,070
Our troops are the finest fighting force in
the history of the world.

275
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:44,930
No nation attacks us directly or our allies
because they know that’s the path to ruin.

276
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:48,880
Surveys show our standing around the world
is higher than when I was elected to this

277
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,550
office, and when it comes to every important
international issue, people of the world do

278
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,050
not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead.

279
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,370
They call us.

280
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:20,470
So I think it’s useful to level set here,
because when we don’t, we don’t make good

281
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,470
decisions.

282
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:27,411
Now, as someone who begins every day with
an intelligence briefing, I know this is a

283
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:28,950
dangerous time.

284
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:36,140
But that’s not primarily because of some
looming superpower out there, and it’s certainly

285
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,990
not because of diminished American strength.

286
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:49,750
In today’s world, we’re threatened less
by evil empires and more by failing states.

287
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,750
The Middle East is going through a transformation
that will play out for a generation, rooted

288
00:30:54,750 --> 00:31:00,390
in conflicts that date back millennia.

289
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:10,030
Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese
economy that is in significant transition.

290
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:18,000
Even as their economy severely contracts,
Russia is pouring resources in to prop up

291
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,880
Ukraine and Syria, client states that they
saw slipping away from their orbit.

292
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,370
And the international system we built after
World War II is now struggling to keep pace

293
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,190
with this new reality.

294
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:44,620
It’s up to us to help, the United States
of America, to help remake that system.

295
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:50,880
And to do that well, it means that we’ve
got to set priorities.

296
00:31:50,880 --> 00:32:10,370
Priority number one is protecting the American
people and going after terrorist networks.

297
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:18,070
Both Al Qaida and now ISIL pose a direct threat
to our people, because in today’s world,

298
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:23,490
even a handful of terrorists who place no
value on human life, including their own,

299
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,720
can do a lot of damage.

300
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:32,270
They use the Internet to poison the minds
of individuals inside our country; their actions

301
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:37,960
undermine and destabilize our allies.

302
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,960
We have to take them out.

303
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:49,850
But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top
claims that this is World War III just play

304
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,710
into their hands.

305
00:32:52,710 --> 00:33:01,860
Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks,
twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages,

306
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:07,960
they pose an enormous danger to civilians,
they have to be stopped, but they do not threaten

307
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,460
our national existence.

308
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:21,860
That is the story ISIL wants to tell; that’s
the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.

309
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:28,821
We don’t need to build them up to show that
we’re serious, and we sure don’t need

310
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:36,230
to push away vital allies in this fight by
echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative

311
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:55,670
of one of the world’s largest religions.

312
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:01,800
We just need to call them what they are: killers
and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted

313
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,070
down, and destroyed.

314
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:13,619
And that’s exactly what we’re doing.

315
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:20,859
For more than a year, America has led a coalition
of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL’s

316
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:26,770
financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow
of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their

317
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,629
vicious ideology.

318
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:31,629
With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking
out their leadership, their oil, their training

319
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:32,629
camps, their vicious ideology.

320
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:34,909
With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we’re taking
out their leadership, their oil, their training

321
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,339
camps, their weapons.

322
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:43,829
We’re training, arming and supporting forces
who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq

323
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:47,239
and Syria.

324
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,609
If this Congress is serious about winning
this war and wants to send a message to our

325
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:56,889
troops and the world, authorize the use of
military force against ISIL.

326
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:01,660
Take a vote.

327
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:08,640
Take a vote.

328
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:16,859
But the American people should know that,
with or without Congressional action, ISIL

329
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:23,160
will learn the same lessons as terrorists
before them.

330
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,660
If you doubt America’s commitment — or
mine — to see that justice is done, just

331
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,559
ask Osama bin Laden.

332
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:43,299
Ask — ask the leader of Al Qaida in Yemen,
who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator

333
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:48,319
of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison
cell.

334
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:51,069
When you come after Americans, we go after
you.

335
00:35:51,069 --> 00:36:09,009
And it may take time, but we have long memories,
and our reach has no limits.

336
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:16,049
Our foreign policy has to be focused on the
threat from ISIL and Al Qaida, but it can’t

337
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,730
stop there.

338
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:27,049
For even without ISIL, even without Al Qaida,
instability will continue for decades in many

339
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:34,779
parts of the world — in the Middle East,
in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, in parts

340
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:39,740
of Central America and Africa and Asia.

341
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:46,150
Some of these places may become safe havens
for new terrorist networks.

342
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:55,410
Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict
or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees.

343
00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:01,440
The world will look to us to help solve these
problems, and our answer needs to be more

344
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:08,510
than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.

345
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:16,660
That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn’t
pass muster on the world stage.

346
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:23,999
We also can’t try to take over and rebuild
every country that falls into crisis...

347
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,380
... even if it’s done with the best of intentions.

348
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:34,849
That’s not leadership; that’s a recipe
for quagmire, spilling American blood and

349
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:38,539
treasure that ultimately will weaken us.

350
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:41,080
It’s the lesson of Vietnam.

351
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:51,069
It’s the lesson of Iraq, and we should have
learned it by now.

352
00:37:51,069 --> 00:38:03,279
Fortunately, there is a smarter approach,
a patient and disciplined strategy that uses

353
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:06,940
every element of our national power.

354
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:14,780
It says America will always act, alone if
necessary, to protect our people and our allies,

355
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:22,740
but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize
the world to work with us, and make sure other

356
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,040
countries pull their own weight.

357
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,450
That’s our approach to conflicts like Syria,
where we’re partnering with local forces

358
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:37,410
and leading international efforts to help
that broken society pursue a lasting peace.

359
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:42,999
That’s why we built a global coalition,
with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to

360
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:45,330
prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.

361
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:51,140
And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its
nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile,

362
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,579
and the world has avoided another war.

363
00:38:54,579 --> 00:39:12,140
That’s how — that’s how we stopped the
spread of Ebola in West Africa.

364
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:17,450
Our military, our doctors, our development
workers — they were heroic.

365
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:23,849
They set up the platform that then allowed
other countries to join in behind us and stamp

366
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:27,859
out that epidemic.

367
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:32,109
Hundreds of thousands — maybe a couple million
lives were saved.

368
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:38,150
That’s how we forged a trans pacific partnership
to open markets, and protect workers and the

369
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,089
environment, and advance American leadership
in Asia.

370
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:50,160
It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America
which will then support more good jobs here

371
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,789
in America.

372
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,880
With TPP, China does not set the rules in
that region, we do.

373
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,099
We want to show our strength in this new century?

374
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:00,750
Approve this agreement, give us the tools
to enforce it.

375
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,150
It’s the right thing to do.

376
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:12,430
Let me give you another example.

377
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:19,820
Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to
promote democracy, it set us back in Latin

378
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,099
America.

379
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:27,420
That’s why we restored diplomatic relations,
opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned

380
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:37,332
ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban
people.

381
00:40:37,332 --> 00:40:42,700
So, if you want to consolidate our leadership
and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize

382
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,849
that the Cold War is over.

383
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:54,400
Lift the embargo.

384
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:02,579
The point is American leadership in the 21st
century is not a choice between ignoring the

385
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:10,150
rest of the world, except when we kill terrorists;
or occupying and rebuilding whatever society

386
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,119
is unraveling.

387
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:19,029
Leadership means a wise application of military
power, and rallying the world behind causes

388
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:20,259
that are right.

389
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:25,540
It means seeing our foreign assistance as
part of our national security, not something

390
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,940
separate, not charity.

391
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:32,730
When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most
ambitious agreement in history to fight climate

392
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:38,170
change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries,
but it also protects our kids.

393
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:44,569
When we help Ukraine defend its democracy,
or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that

394
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:49,820
strengthens the international order we depend
on.

395
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:54,730
When we help African countries feed their
people and care for the sick...

396
00:41:54,730 --> 00:42:04,420
It’s the right thing to do, and it prevents
the next pandemic from reaching our shores.

397
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:09,680
Now right now, we are on track to end the
scourge of HIV/AIDS, that’s within our grasp,

398
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:23,650
and we have the chance to accomplish the same
thing with malaria, something I’ll be pushing

399
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:30,479
this Congress to fund this year.

400
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:32,480
That’s American strength.

401
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,910
That’s American leadership.

402
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:39,440
And that kind of leadership depends on the
power of our example.

403
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,220
That is why I will keep working to shut down
the prison at Guantanamo.

404
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:49,329
It’s expensive, it’s unnecessary, and
it only serves as a recruitment brochure for

405
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:51,650
our enemies.

406
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:56,279
There’s a better way.

407
00:42:56,279 --> 00:43:06,579
And that’s why we need to reject any politics
— any politics that targets people because

408
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:10,480
of race or religion.

409
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:25,740
Let me just say this.

410
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,539
This isn’t a matter of political correctness.

411
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:37,940
This is a matter of understanding just what
it is that makes us strong.

412
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:50,670
The world respects us not just for our arsenal,
it respects us for our diversity and our openness

413
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,450
and the way we respect every faith.

414
00:43:53,450 --> 00:44:02,170
His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body
from the very spot I’m standing on tonight

415
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:06,890
that “to imitate the hatred and violence
of tyrants and murderers is the best way to

416
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:12,339
take their place.”

417
00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:24,730
When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad,
or fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized,

418
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:31,759
or a kid is called names, that doesn’t make
us safer.

419
00:44:31,759 --> 00:44:40,160
That’s not telling it what — telling it
like it is, it’s just wrong.

420
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,059
It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.

421
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:43,289
It makes it harder to achieve our goals.

422
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:59,480
It betrays who we are as a country.

423
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:19,880
“We the People.”

424
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:27,170
Our Constitution begins with those three simple
words, words we’ve come to recognize mean

425
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:30,849
all the people, not just some.

426
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:42,010
Words that insist we rise and fall together,
that that’s how we might perfect our union.

427
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:48,900
And that brings me to the fourth, and maybe
most important thing that I want to say tonight.

428
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:58,170
The future we want, all of us want — opportunity
and security for our families, a rising standard

429
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:10,099
of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet
for our kids — all that is within our reach.

430
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:14,289
But it will only happen if we work together.

431
00:46:14,289 --> 00:46:21,640
It will only happen if we can have rational,
constructive debates.

432
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:27,430
It will only happen if we fix our politics.

433
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,059
A better politics doesn’t mean we have to
agree on everything.

434
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:36,499
This is a big country, different regions,
different attitudes, different interests.

435
00:46:36,499 --> 00:46:39,440
That’s one of our strengths, too.

436
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,710
Our Founders distributed power between states
and branches of government, and expected us

437
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:53,740
to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over
the size and shape of government, over commerce

438
00:46:53,740 --> 00:47:02,750
and foreign relations, over the meaning of
liberty and the imperatives of security.

439
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:10,790
But democracy does require basic bonds of
trust between its citizens.

440
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:17,210
It doesn’t — it doesn’t work if we think
the people who disagree with us are all motivated

441
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:28,170
by malice, it doesn’t work if we think that
our political opponents are unpatriotic or

442
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:33,299
trying to weaken America.

443
00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:40,859
Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness
to compromise or when even basic facts are

444
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:48,690
contested or when we listen only to those
who agree with us.

445
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:54,809
Our public life withers when only the most
extreme voices get all the attention.

446
00:47:54,809 --> 00:48:01,900
And most of all, democracy breaks down when
the average person feels their voice doesn’t

447
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:07,559
matter; that the system is rigged in favor
of the rich or the powerful or some special

448
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:11,519
interest.

449
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,509
Too many Americans feel that way right now.

450
00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:20,819
It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency
— that the rancor and suspicion between

451
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:24,640
the parties has gotten worse instead of better.

452
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,130
I have no doubt a president with the gifts
of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better

453
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:35,130
bridged the divide, and I guarantee I’ll
keep trying to be better so long as I hold

454
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,539
this office.

455
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:44,640
But my fellow Americans, this cannot be my
task — or any president’s — alone.

456
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,369
There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber
— good people — who would like to see

457
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:58,930
more cooperation, would like to see a more
elevated debate in Washington but feel trapped

458
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:06,099
by the imperatives of getting elected, by
the noise coming out of your base.

459
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:08,660
I know; you’ve told me.

460
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:13,170
It’s the worst-kept secret in Washington.

461
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:22,779
And a lot of you aren’t enjoying being trapped
in that kind of rancor.

462
00:49:22,779 --> 00:49:28,539
But that means if we want a better politics
— and I’m addressing the American people

463
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:33,739
now — if we want a better politics, it’s
not enough just to change a congressman or

464
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:38,150
change a senator or even change a president.

465
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:44,950
We have to change the system to reflect our
better selves.

466
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,319
I think we’ve got to end the practice of
drawing our congressional districts so that

467
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:53,239
politicians can pick their voters and not
the other way around.

468
00:49:53,239 --> 00:50:06,489
Let a bipartisan group do it.

469
00:50:06,489 --> 00:50:13,690
I believe we’ve got to reduce the influence
of money in our politics, so that a handful

470
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:21,619
of families or hidden interests can’t bankroll
our elections.

471
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:26,150
And if our existing approach to campaign finance
reform can’t pass muster in the courts,

472
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:31,400
we need to work together to find a real solution,
because it’s a problem.

473
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,480
And most of you don’t like raising money.

474
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,239
I know.

475
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:37,880
I’ve done it.

476
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,739
We’ve got to make it easier to vote, not
harder.

477
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:56,749
We need to modernize it for the way we live
now.

478
00:50:56,749 --> 00:50:58,740
This is America.

479
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,420
We want to make it easier for people to participate.

480
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,700
And over the course of this year, I intend
to travel the country to push for reforms

481
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,289
that do just that.

482
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:15,749
But I can’t do these things on my own.

483
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:24,699
Changes in our political process — in not
just who gets elected, but how they get elected

484
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:31,880
— that will only happen when the American
people demand it.

485
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,650
It depends on you.

486
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:43,170
That’s what’s meant by a government of,
by, and for the people.

487
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:49,640
What I’m suggesting is hard.

488
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:58,460
It’s a lot easier to be cynical, to accept
that change is not possible, and politics

489
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:08,010
is hopeless, and the problem is, all the folks
who are elected don’t care, and to believe

490
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:12,960
that our voices and our actions don’t matter.

491
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:19,839
But if we give up now, then we forsake a better
future.

492
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,950
Those with money and power will gain greater
control over the decisions that could send

493
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:31,739
a young soldier to war, or allow another economic
disaster, or roll back the equal rights and

494
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:39,279
voting rights that generations of Americans
have fought, even died, to secure.

495
00:52:39,279 --> 00:52:45,619
And then, as frustration grows, there will
be voices urging us to fall back into our

496
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:52,339
respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens
who don’t look like us, or pray like us,

497
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:58,829
or vote like we do, or share the same background.

498
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:03,000
We can’t afford to go down that path.

499
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,400
It won’t deliver the economy we want.

500
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,940
It will not produce the security we want.

501
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:16,250
But most of all, it contradicts everything
that makes us the envy of the world.

502
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:24,180
So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may
believe, whether you prefer one party or no

503
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:30,900
party, whether you supported my agenda or
fought as hard as you could against it, our

504
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:41,890
collective futures depends on your willingness
to uphold your duties as a citizen, to vote,

505
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:51,989
to speak out, to stand up for others, especially
the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing

506
00:53:51,989 --> 00:54:13,150
that each of us is only here because somebody
somewhere stood up for us.

507
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:20,099
We need every American to stay active in our
public life and not just during election time

508
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:26,609
so that our public life reflects the goodness
and the decency that I see in the American

509
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:29,920
people every single day.

510
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,359
It is not easy.

511
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:39,799
Our brand of democracy is hard.

512
00:54:39,799 --> 00:54:44,599
But I can promise that, a little over a year
from now, when I no longer hold this office,

513
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:52,849
I will be right there with you as a citizen,
inspired by those voices of fairness and vision,

514
00:54:52,849 --> 00:55:01,440
of grit and good humor and kindness, that
have helped America travel so far.

515
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,960
Voices that help us see ourselves not first
and foremost as black or white or Asian or

516
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:16,940
Latino; not as gay or straight, immigrant
or native born; not Democrat or Republican;

517
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:23,249
but as Americans first, bound by a common
creed.

518
00:55:23,249 --> 00:55:31,730
Voices Dr. King believed would have the final
word — voices of unarmed truth and unconditional

519
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:34,469
love.

520
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:35,710
And they’re out there, those voices.

521
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:39,619
They don’t get a lot of attention.

522
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:48,739
They don’t seek a lot of fanfare, but they’re
busy doing the work this country needs doing.

523
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:54,250
I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible
country of ours.

524
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,809
I see you, the American people.

525
00:55:57,809 --> 00:56:04,769
And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see
our future unfolding.

526
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:09,819
I see it in the worker on the assembly line
who clocked extra shifts to keep his company

527
00:56:09,819 --> 00:56:18,130
open, and the boss who pays him higher wages
instead of laying him off.

528
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:24,119
I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late
at night to finish her science project, and

529
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:31,410
the teacher who comes in early, maybe with
some extra supplies that she bought, because

530
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:38,130
she knows that that young girl might someday
cure a disease.

531
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:45,059
I see it in the American who’s served his
time, made bad mistakes as a child, but now

532
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:53,489
is dreaming of starting over, and I see it
in the business owner who gives him that second

533
00:56:53,489 --> 00:56:59,800
chance; the protester determined to prove
that justice matters; and the young cop walking

534
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:05,680
the beat, treating everybody with respect,
doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us

535
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,190
safe.

536
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:17,940
I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything
to save his brothers, the nurse who tends

537
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:26,190
to him until he can run a marathon, the community
that lines up to cheer him on.

538
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:33,680
It’s the son who finds the courage to come
out as who he is, and the father whose love

539
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,710
for that son overrides everything he’s been
taught.

540
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:44,319
I see it in the elderly woman who will wait
in line to cast her vote as long as she has

541
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:53,609
to; the new citizen who casts his vote for
the first time; the volunteers at the polls

542
00:57:53,609 --> 00:58:00,029
who believe every vote should count, because
each of them, in different ways, know how

543
00:58:00,029 --> 00:58:04,950
much that precious right is worth.

544
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:09,039
That’s the America I know.

545
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:12,609
That’s the country we love.

546
00:58:12,609 --> 00:58:22,720
Clear- eyed, big-hearted, undaunted by challenge,
optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional

547
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,769
love will have the final word.

548
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:30,069
That’s what makes me so hopeful about our
future.

549
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:34,760
I believe in change because I believe in you,
the American people.

550
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,529
And that’s why I stand here, as confident
as I have ever been, that the state of our

551
00:58:37,529 --> 00:58:38,529
Union is strong.

552
00:58:38,529 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the
United States of America.
