well we are here with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan which is pretty awesome and we are here in the in the ceremonial room outside the speaker's office where apparently they sign bills and have heads of state which I'm sure you're honored to be here with me welcome thank you so much you know there's a lot to talk about obviously the elections are coming up and first let me get your thoughts on and where you think things are gonna head you know it's a long ways away I feel good about our chances midterm elections are hard on the majority party midterm elections for a president's first midterm on average you lose like 32 seats we've got a 24 seat majority so just clearly with the headwind of history in front of us that's not a good thing but I feel like we're gonna have a tailwind of accomplishments to get us into the midterms we can get into the all the agenda but we've done so many things in such a short period of time they will actually made a positive difference in people's lives and I think we're gonna have a really good story to tell not to mention the fact that our candidates our members are battle-hardened they know how to run tough tough races so I feel very very good about where we are so I want to start by talking about some of those accomplishments and then I want to get to sort of the the tactics that you guys are gonna use in the in the election campaign yeah so obviously you know the top of the list for accomplishments is the tax bill and Democrats losing their minds sort of tax bill did not look particularly good so it's fair to point to Nancy Pelosi saying that you've given the American people crumbs and say that that's that's wrong so how much do you think that'll impact that's gonna be the gift that keeps giving justice that just that statement but every single Democrat voted against this I really think they did that because they thought they were gonna psych us into defeating ourselves it's particularly in the Senate and when they kept pushing this line they went so far left so hard progressive that every single Democrat voted against it they're on the wrong side of history and they're on the wrong side of results I've been working on this issue a long time and basically we have this is bigger than 1986 tax reform so this is the first time in 31 years we've done tax reform but it's much more profound than the tax reform we did back then in 1986 because this completely changes the way we tax ourselves on an international competitive basis and this will put such a strong foundation of Girl an opportunity and free enterprise in America more so than any kind of economic reform in in my lifetime I'm convinced to that and so they're on the wrong side of history this takes a tax system that was the worst in the industrialized world and gives us a tax system that we think is in the top three of the industrialized worlds tax systems that means more jobs in America more opportunity in America businesses coming back to America bringing capital back to America expanding and that is a phenomenally good thing it's gonna get more careers better wages better benefits more entrepreneurship and the Democrats are against all of that well one of the things that's really difficult in the job that you have mr. speaker is obviously that you are forced to do pot I mean your job is to do policy but at the same time it seems to me that elections are very little about policy these days and they seem to be much more about different moral stances and maybe we hope battle of ideas right how do you plan on tackling there because you know we can talk about our policies being great all day long if good policy one Republicans would never lose but but the problem is obviously that it particularly posed among young people they're really really egregiously bad I mean 70 percent of my audience is under the age of 35 and the polls even among conservative youngsters from our Republicans are not good how are you gonna win the battle of ideas when when you're so focused on talking policy and is there a way to say that's always been my issue I've always strongly believed that elections need to be about choices and about ideas and that's why in 2016 I got our House Republicans together to come up with an agenda and to run on it we called it the better way so that we would have a game plan we would give the country a very clear choice and that if we won the election we would have earned the right to put that agenda in place where two-thirds of the way from doing through doing that right now and that gives us a good story to tell which is here's what we said we would do here's what we did this is what we did in Wisconsin by the way in 2010 the state legislature our governor it's a model that I believe in that I saw work there it's something we're trying to apply here nationally and then we also have to go with new ideas in the election to continue this this reform agenda to disrupt it now the point you made I think is important about what about young people the thing that bothers me the most and I know you've talked about this a bit these identity politics I hate identity politics it's wrong it's morally wrong but also it's insidious and it's in its practice on both sides our job is to reject identity politics and try and replace it with better ideas and idea in aspirational politics I'm a jack camp acolyte I'm a big believer in using our core founding principles applying to the problems and show that their solutions for everybody and that to me is the kind of an agenda and temperament we have to have going into the 2018 elections and so I wanted to ask you about that specifically not in terms of you know efficiencies in economics but about the moral differences that you see between you and Lumpy's I think these are that's the road issue particularly for young people because you know you and I are both big towns actually you long before before I was and and in a much more prominent way but you're big on entitlement reform entitlement reform is obviously a difficult thing to sell to a bunch of 17 year-olds you never think they will be 60 right you know there's not a seventeen-year-old in America who cares about their social security because they're never going to be of age to receive it and so you know this when I speak to young people which I do on a regular basis it seems to me that what they really want to hear is about this moral differentiation so in your view moving below sort of the the top of the iceberg in politics moving below the water level what do you think is the big distinction between right and left in American politics that needs to be elucidated yeah we believe in equality of opportunity they believe in a quality of outcome equality of opportunity means we want to make sure that we use these guiding principles that built this country liberty freedom free enterprise self-determination government by consent which gives you an open economy which gives you freedom which gives you the ability to chart your life the way you want to and we strive to promote equality of opportunity so that the most people can get the most opportunities possible and nowhere else is that ever made more clear than a free enterprise system and then a freedom democratic capitalism like we have like our system is a built on natural rights what the Left believes in and look you're asking it conserved what the Left believes in but they believe in equality of outcome the difference in the kind and size and role of government you have between what we're saying and what they're saying is enormous having an equality of outcome agenda means elites in Washington unelected bureaucrats micromanage our lives and are in everything we do in such a way that they believe they have to decide how are what the results of our lives are that's very different a sense of equality which is they make things equal in the end an outcome of things that gives you a stagnant society that gives you a top-down society that gives you this is I would come from Wisconsin which is the birthplace the Progressive Party they believe in all this early 20th century progressivism Hegel and Bismarck and all these guys who basically think that we're all rubes and Dubes and we don't know enough so we need to delegate our power to these these these smart bureaucrats that are insulated from elections so they can harmonize and micromanage our lives and that is an equality of outcome philosophy it's antithetical to our founding philosophy and that at the end of the day is the big difference here and so the fights we have up here in many cases not every one but in many cases are fights of that origin and i think that you know i've i've been watching obviously your political ascent for my entire life because but certainly over the last day you know 15 years and one of the things that i wish that you had the opportunity to speak more about that Steinem because it seems like you're sucked more into speaking about the efficiency on the day's job yeah right exactly exactly because we do need thought leaders in the in the conservative movement who are talking specifically about the roots of the left and talking specifically about the the way that natural rights have been overcome by a different regime of how rights are thought about right the different positive and negative rights it right so when I go to I talk to schools all the time young people I always say look these are our rights given to us pre government you don't even have to believe in God to believe that they come from God that they're pre government so government can't take those away from us that's us that's where sovereign I don't even like the idea of negative versus positive that's more of a left construct but the idea of government granted rights means we give our power to the government I always say the health care debate everybody says health care czar right if you buy into that premise then we're saying we're giving our power to our government to tell us how when where and under what circumstances we get to exercise that right we're giving the government way too much power than we should that's what the left is saying when they say they want to grant us these new rights the best thing that I found when I talk to young crowds is if we do not get entitlements under control which we can with more choice and competition and free enterprise and show we don't get these things under control we were gonna bankrupt the next generation we've run the federal government I round the numbers we've run the federal government for the last 60 years by taking about 20 cents out of every dollar made in America produced in America to pay for the federal government if we do nothing add no new programs do nothing by the time my kids are having kids we're gonna have to take 40 cents out of every single dollar made in America to pay for this government at that time before they even get on to doing something else they want to do with their government so we will bankrupt the next generation I actually had the CBO run numbers years ago and what tax rates would have to be it goes up as high as 88% looking for tax rates just to pay for this government at that time so I try to explain to people in dollars and cents just what's going to happen to them if the left gets their way they produce this equality of outcome agenda we don't reform entitlements and we stick with these kind of command and control systems so I try to find a way of explaining in dollars and cents what their future will look like from an economic and tax standpoint and how liberty and opportunity will be will be crushed if we stay in this particular path ok so I also before well have the opportunity one they asked you about sort of the legislature versus executive balance because one of the things that I've been critiquing for a long time in the country and I was doing it under Bush I was doing it under Obama I'm doing it under the Trump administration is the is the increasing power of the executive branch it seemingly at the expense of the legislative branch the growing bureaucracy I and the and the feeling that the legislative branch over the last century and a half really has abdicated its duty to by kicking it over to the bureaucracy a good example of this being trade you know the president obviously is is pushing a particular agenda on trade this was not in the purview of the executive branch originally this is in the purview of the legislative branch you know the Speaker of the House what do you how do you hope to do hope to reestablish the balance originally we did some of we except I wrote the trade promotion Authority law which was it allow us to go get trade agreements and we brought some of that power back into the legislative branch but not nearly as much as we'd like so I can go into the particulars of that but there's a couple of things that we're trying to do here that we've passed out of the house the biggest complaint you'll hear from a house Republican is the Senate filibuster and getting things through the Senate we have this thing called the reins act which we think is sort of the catch-all of cleaning article one which is 32 state legislators do this you pass a big law it's vague and and then the bureaucracy fills in the details with its rules and regulations and that just then happens and so you end up having all these unelected bureaucracies effectively writing the laws we experience we think that's wrong so what we're saying with this reins Act which is you pass a law the rules and regulations get published and then those rules and regulations come back to Congress for final vote approval or amendment before they go into effect so that they're consented to by the elected branch of government the people who are electing to write the laws before they go into effect and that holds us accountable too so to that end what we do is we try to in the bills we pass since we can't get that through the Senate yet we try to do it on an individual basis on a bill by bill basis and then I did something else we have these lawyers called the Legislative Council it's the office of legislative caucus their actual bill drafters maybe should share the Ways and Means Committee which is mostly tax laws and health care law's tax laws have to be written really tightly very very prescriptive Lee and so I was worried we were writing too big of a law we were integrating really vague laws and giving all this discretion of mediocrity except in tax laws so what I did was I promoted the guy who was head of the tax law writing department to run the entire Legislative Council Department to train the other lawyers of the Legislative Council howdy right law is really prescriptively right so that we can reduce the kind of open end of the discretion we end up getting the executive branch so I'm trying to change sort of the culture of the way we legislate here so that we're far more detailed and prescriptive to not give all this discretion to the executive branch I really appreciate you taking the time and again you have one of the hardest jobs and all I do not envy you but but I appreciate that you're trying to make philosophical arguments in a time when it seems that a lot of people are actually this is part of my day so thank you I appreciate
