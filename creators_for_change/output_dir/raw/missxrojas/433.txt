had parent troubles and boy troubles and

30
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,760
she related them to the viewer breaking

31
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,620
the fourth wall speaking directly to the

32
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,539
camera and using fun graphics around her

33
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:58,949
face and her video games that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's</font>

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,220
will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> someday maybe it's a graduation</font>

or I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know feed myself and</font>

42
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,409
stuff but parking meter looks like a

43
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">good way to go this breaking the fourth</font>

44
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,400
wall i think is a really important

45
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,380
technique and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's repeated again in the</font>

recent film easy a and the stone<font color="#CCCCCC"> stars</font>

50
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,409
enjoyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a lot the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking the fourth</font>

51
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,540
wall here is in the form of a webcast it

52
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,770
takes a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you to notice that</font>

53
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,390
that's exactly what's going on is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

54
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,829
talks directly to the camera once again

55
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,329
firstly both these characters really

56
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,970
assured humorous non spiteful people and

57
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,470
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I turn on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the television to</font>

58
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,540
find another brand<font color="#E5E5E5"> new series about rich</font>

59
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,549
American teenagers doing the same things

60
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,500
over and over again every series wound

61
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,850
and every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I lose faith in the world</font>

62
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,500
upon seeing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I then think about</font>

63
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,700
these two characters and then I was

64
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,350
thinking why I admire these female

65
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,299
characters so much and why I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

66
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">of their roles work so well and I think</font>

67
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,960
it's part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what videoblogging does I</font>

68
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,610
don't know if my video blogs do it but I

69
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that video blogging in general and</font>

70
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,240
breaking the fourth wall in general does

71
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,610
it requires you to look at women in a

72
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,200
different way or at least these two

73
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,758
characters who are so intelligent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

74
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,378
funny and just wonderful I have a

75
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,030
magazine addiction it's extremely

76
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,740
unhealthy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have tried to cut myself</font>

77
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,870
I'm partly just because so expensive but

78
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,190
if you flick through a fashion magazine

79
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,170
or any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of magazine intended for</font>

80
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,270
women you will see women staring back at

81
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,550
women demanding that you desire them not

82
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,260
to go too much into English literature

83
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,270
student at<font color="#E5E5E5"> University territory but it's</font>

84
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,860
that male gaze that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask at you they</font>

85
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,570
asking you to look at them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

86
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,640
way that men are supposed to look at

87
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,440
them the sad truth<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that as much as we</font>

88
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,480
may love to deny it we continue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

89
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,250
at women like sex objects I would argue

90
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a woman can seem secretary</font>

91
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,190
empowered without using the male gaze

92
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,960
we've been tricked and trained into

93
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,160
using male<font color="#E5E5E5"> gaze for such a long time</font>

94
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,960
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> often don't even notice that's</font>

95
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,220
what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> when these two</font>

96
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,960
characters in this program and in this

97
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">film look into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> camera they are</font>

98
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,010
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to have a conversation and</font>

99
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,300
that is something remarkable they're not

100
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking you to desire them they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

101
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,660
asking you to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to them to</font>

102
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,490
reflect with them to sympathize with

103
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,020
them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to their story that's</font>

104
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,580
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> strange that we have to remind</font>

105
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,050
ourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think on those kind of</font>

106
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,700
subconscious level that women can look

107
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,230
at men for some reason other than

108
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,820
wanting to be desired or that women can

109
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,410
look at anyone for some reason other

110
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,910
than wanted to be desired I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

111
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,810
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be some people whose</font>

112
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,640
response to this is like feminazi come

113
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,170
on come down everything's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine</font>

114
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,060
everything's<font color="#CCCCCC"> chill but I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not like</font>

115
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,920
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a go at men or anything I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

116
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,710
think that anyone's individuals fault I

117
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,850
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's important to look at</font>

118
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,620
techniques in which we can look at how

119
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,690
women<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arts and film and</font>

120
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,250
writing spoke already about Helen

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,540
succeeds wonderful essay in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

122
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,490
says she refuses life<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing there's a</font>

healthy helping of<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-sequiturs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

124
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,970
video but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

125
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,440
was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it just occurred</font>

126
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,950
to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> how strange</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is how important to</font>

127
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,910
have women looking and not one T to be

128
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,440
desired and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> how sad it is that</font>

129
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,880
there has to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case I don't know</font>

130
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,070
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> this make sense let me know in</font>
