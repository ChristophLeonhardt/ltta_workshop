we have live pictures now from the 9/11 memorial in lower Manhattan where today the names of thousands of Americans will be read aloud one by one joining us now from lower Manhattan member of the intelligence and homeland security committees Republican Congressman Peter King of New York very good to have you on the show this morning congressman I guess we should begin looking back and and remembering all those who were lost on 9/11 by also looking ahead and asking exactly how much safer we are today and if this administration has increased our safety or decreased it around the globe first of all it's not her to be here today to the back and to realize the tremendous heroism and bravery that day and also to still mourn for those who were lost because so many lost so many friends and neighbors and it's a day that none of us will ever forget we are in this country that's bipartisan going back to first and fourth since 2001 continuing through President Obama and our president drop here at home and also the coordination overseas with the allies no matter what disputes we may have the fact is even during the height of the Iraq war when the French and the US weren't really in much contact the intelligence agencies were so here in the US we have Homeland Security CIA FBI dia here in New York working with the NYPD the Nets of Suffolk County police state police all working together Joint Terrorism Task Force and then our allies are sharing information again this is continued unabated since 2001 so I think it's safe to say that a 9/11 type of attack would never happen again it'll be a one-in-a-million shot having said that the enemy is always adopting the enemy is always fainting so we have to adopt to try to stay ahead of them all the time so every day of the week 24/7 52 weeks here all of these agencies I mentioned to you all of the overseas friends and allies we have or even those were just allies and convenience of sharing information with us to try to head off the next attack but again we never know when it's going to happen we've had many offshoots back in 9/11 there were several people operating out of a cave in Afghanistan now we have Isis we have Elsa Bob we have all these other variations are Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula we have the internet which is being used to have service emerged out of the basement you know being self energized so all of this it's it's still an ongoing challenge that threatens to layer but the good news is that there's much more coordination and a 911 type attack be very difficult we have to look out for dirty bomb attacks Lohia nuclear attacks but again we're aware will alert much more than we were in the days leading up to 9/11 congressman King and swilley Geist you've been a leader and taking care of the first responders who worked on that pile for weeks and months after the attack of September 11th we've been talking a lot about the victims that day want to talk more about the victims that came afterward some 2000 first responders have died because they got sick breathing in that toxic air as they worked to look for remains as they unpeeled all that steel and all that glass by some estimates congressman there could by the end of this year just a few months from now be more deaths to that group of people than there were from the attack that day what more does this country need to do to take care of those men and women well we have to do everything we possibly can and this is what's been one of my most unfortunate experiences in Congress but it took us so long it took in 2001 to the end of 2010 before this 9/11 health fund was set up and then we had to reauthorize it again in 2015 was only created for five years now we have it extended now for the next 75 80 years and the funding will be there and I would encourage anyone who is at Ground Zero anyone who is even near Ground Zero during those days to sign up there's a registry with the illnesses and diseases that these people have gotten from 9/11 they're very rare in so many cases and they are some of them are late and it's only now that some people realize they have a 911 type blood disorder or a cancer or a tumor there's so many lung diseases we go for the list of these rare diseases so anyone was there that we they have special doctors out who are the tool just for the site builder and have people register and we have an absolute obligation to make sure that every one of them is gets the medical assistance they need the families are compensated before us again I I guess I started noticing about two or three years after 9/11 young men and women and the primal life was coming down with utilities I go yeah there are people in Congress say it was all a hoax was terrible congressman King this is that David Ignatius in Washington one of the things we would remember on this anniversary and especially at the spot you are Ground Zero is how unified America was in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 I want to ask you as a leading member of Congress what is it that the Congress could do what is it that this White House could do to bring more of a sense of unity to the country seventeen years later yeah and I would say let's talk to both let's talk the White House let's talk to Congress both parties in Congress we have to find ways areas we agree on and emphasize that so the American people will see that where we disagree they're honest areas of disagreement not society to the sake of fighting not just appealing to the narrow places of our party which is what happens today I mean what happened with Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill for instance on Social Security on other issues where you had the most conservative president ever maybe the most liberal speaker at that time there was coming together it's actually forged compromise they fought hard they when he gets you to them and they had to they also knew the importance of finding common ground that I think would show the American people that were not just in this for cheap party partisan game but we do have the interested country at hand so when there are real disagreement people know they're real right now it's not to tell what's real and what's not we fight over everything and I think again I would ask the president I would have to hear members of Congress and Senate the house define areas where we agree and then fight over the areas where we don't and in those areas where we don't try to find some sort of common ground Congressman Peter King thank you so much for being on the show this morning that you honoring
