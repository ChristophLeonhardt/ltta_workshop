1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:02,058
PRESIDENT THAT LASTED LESS THAN TWO MINUTES?

2
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,670
TWO MINUTES? THINK ABOUT IT.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,363
EDDIE GLAUDE, JOHN PODHORETZ AND BETWEEN THE GLAUDE AND HAD POD

4
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:11,236
BETWEEN THE GLAUDE AND HAD POD IS ALEXI McCAMMAN.

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,572
IS ALEXI McCAMMAN. MIMI, TAKING THE 30,000-FOOT

6
00:00:13,615 --> 00:00:13,872
MIMI, TAKING THE 30,000-FOOT VIEW.

7
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:15,540
VIEW. TRUMP IS THE SUBJECT OF A

8
00:00:15,584 --> 00:00:16,541
TRUMP IS THE SUBJECT OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION THAT IS

9
00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:17,642
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION THAT IS PROBING HIS CAMPAIGN.

10
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:19,844
PROBING HIS CAMPAIGN. MICHAEL COHEN HAS A RECORDED

11
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:20,846
MICHAEL COHEN HAS A RECORDED CONVERSATION WITH DONALD TRUMP

12
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:23,582
CONVERSATION WITH DONALD TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

13
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,883
DURING THE CAMPAIGN. EVERYTHING POINTS TO THERE BEING

14
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:26,151
EVERYTHING POINTS TO THERE BEING MORE RECORDINGS.

15
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:26,985
MORE RECORDINGS. EARLIER TODAY YOU SAID THIS WAS

16
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,720
EARLIER TODAY YOU SAID THIS WAS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

17
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:29,988
JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

18
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:32,491
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> WELL, WHAT I MEANT, KATY, IS

19
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,360
>> WELL, WHAT I MEANT, KATY, IS THAT AS YOU SAID, THERE LIKELY

20
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:35,594
THAT AS YOU SAID, THERE LIKELY ARE MORE RECORDINGS.

21
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:38,363
ARE MORE RECORDINGS. AND THIS ONE MAY BE TWO MINUTES

22
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:41,700
AND THIS ONE MAY BE TWO MINUTES LONG, BUT WE DON’T KNOW HOW LONG

23
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,302
LONG, BUT WE DON’T KNOW HOW LONG THE OTHER ONES ARE.

24
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:45,070
THE OTHER ONES ARE. EVEN IF THERE AREN’T OTHER

25
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,104
EVEN IF THERE AREN’T OTHER RECORDINGS, ANY RECORDING IS

26
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:47,505
RECORDINGS, ANY RECORDING IS LIKE A SMOKING GUN IN THE SENSE

27
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:50,809
LIKE A SMOKING GUN IN THE SENSE THAT IF MICHAEL COHEN BECOMES A

28
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:53,378
THAT IF MICHAEL COHEN BECOMES A SIGNED-UP COOPERATEOR AND HE IS

29
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:55,481
SIGNED-UP COOPERATEOR AND HE IS SOME DAY ON THE STAND OR IN AN

30
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:57,116
SOME DAY ON THE STAND OR IN AN AFFIDAVIT TELLING A STORY ABOUT

31
00:00:57,126 --> 00:00:59,418
AFFIDAVIT TELLING A STORY ABOUT EVENTS THAT OCCURRED BETWEEN HIM

32
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:02,388
EVENTS THAT OCCURRED BETWEEN HIM AND TRUMP AND OTHERS, THE

33
00:01:02,398 --> 00:01:03,822
AND TRUMP AND OTHERS, THE PROSECUTORS WILL NEED WHAT’S

34
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,623
PROSECUTORS WILL NEED WHAT’S CALLED CORROBORATION.

35
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:06,325
CALLED CORROBORATION. THAT’S THE KEY TO ANY CRIMINAL

36
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:06,625
THAT’S THE KEY TO ANY CRIMINAL CASE.

37
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,727
CASE. AND A RECORDING OF MICHAEL COHEN

38
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:10,629
AND A RECORDING OF MICHAEL COHEN AND TRUMP TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING

39
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:12,664
AND TRUMP TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING REALLY WILL LIKELY CORROBORATE

40
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,000
REALLY WILL LIKELY CORROBORATE THINGS THAT MICHAEL COHEN IS

41
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,835
THINGS THAT MICHAEL COHEN IS TELLING THEM, TELLING THE

42
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:17,235
TELLING THEM, TELLING THE PROSECUTORS.

43
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:19,705
PROSECUTORS. AND SO IT CAN BECOME VERY

44
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:20,339
AND SO IT CAN BECOME VERY VALUABLE.

45
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:21,674
VALUABLE. IT IS VERY VALUABLE EVIDENCE

46
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:24,109
IT IS VERY VALUABLE EVIDENCE THAT PROSECUTORS CAN USE TO

47
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,144
THAT PROSECUTORS CAN USE TO CORROBORATE NOT JUST WHAT IS

48
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:27,246
CORROBORATE NOT JUST WHAT IS SPECIFICALLY ON THE RECORDING,

49
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:28,714
SPECIFICALLY ON THE RECORDING, WHICH SOUNDS HERE LIKE IT’S

50
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:30,149
WHICH SOUNDS HERE LIKE IT’S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT, BUT ALSO

51
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:32,051
GOING TO BE IMPORTANT, BUT ALSO JUST TO BOLSTER THE CREDIBILITY

52
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:33,619
JUST TO BOLSTER THE CREDIBILITY OF THE WITNESS IN GENERAL SO

53
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:36,155
OF THE WITNESS IN GENERAL SO THAT A JURY OR OTHERS BELIEVE

54
00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:36,989
THAT A JURY OR OTHERS BELIEVE OTHER THINGS THAT THAT WITNESS

55
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:37,957
OTHER THINGS THAT THAT WITNESS IS TELLING YOU.

56
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:39,458
IS TELLING YOU. SO IT’S A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE

57
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:39,925
SO IT’S A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF EVIDENCE.

58
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,060
OF EVIDENCE. >> SO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE

59
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:44,764
>> SO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TAPE THAT WE HAVE IS FROM --

60
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:46,065
TAPE THAT WE HAVE IS FROM -- MOSTLY FROM RUDY GIULIANI.

61
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:47,500
MOSTLY FROM RUDY GIULIANI. HOW THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT A

62
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:49,235
HOW THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT A PAYMENT TO KAREN McDOUGAL AND

63
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:50,369
PAYMENT TO KAREN McDOUGAL AND TALKING ABOUT WRITING HER A

64
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,937
TALKING ABOUT WRITING HER A CHECK INSTEAD OF SENDING HER

65
00:01:51,948 --> 00:01:52,471
CHECK INSTEAD OF SENDING HER CASH.

66
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:53,505
CASH. ULTIMATELY THAT DIDN’T HAPPEN

67
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,374
ULTIMATELY THAT DIDN’T HAPPEN BECAUSE "THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER"

68
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:57,276
BECAUSE "THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER" ENDED UP BUYING HER STORY AND

69
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:59,378
ENDED UP BUYING HER STORY AND GIVING HER A CONTRACT, IN RETURN

70
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:00,680
GIVING HER A CONTRACT, IN RETURN THAT SHE SAYS THIS DID NOT

71
00:02:00,723 --> 00:02:01,080
THAT SHE SAYS THIS DID NOT FULFILL.

72
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,915
FULFILL. THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT

73
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,983
THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT CONVERSATION, WHAT ARE THEY?

74
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:05,785
CONVERSATION, WHAT ARE THEY? >> FIRST OF ALL, JUST BECAUSE

75
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:08,354
>> FIRST OF ALL, JUST BECAUSE THEY DID NOT -- THEY MEANING

76
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:12,091
THEY DID NOT -- THEY MEANING TRUMP AND COHEN, DID NOT PAY

77
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:14,293
TRUMP AND COHEN, DID NOT PAY KAREN McDOUGAL BUT SOMEBODY ELSE

78
00:02:14,303 --> 00:02:15,761
KAREN McDOUGAL BUT SOMEBODY ELSE DID DOESN’T TAKE THEM OUT OF THE

79
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:16,195
DID DOESN’T TAKE THEM OUT OF THE EQUATION.

80
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:17,797
EQUATION. I THINK THAT’S WHAT GIULIANI IS

81
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,069
I THINK THAT’S WHAT GIULIANI IS TRYING TO SAY, THAT THIS IS

82
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:23,502
TRYING TO SAY, THAT THIS IS EXCULPATORY.

83
00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:24,203
EXCULPATORY. THEY TALKED ABOUT IT BUT THEY

84
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:24,904
THEY TALKED ABOUT IT BUT THEY DIDN’T WRITE THE CHECK.

85
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:27,206
DIDN’T WRITE THE CHECK. THAT’S NOT HOW THE LAW WORKS.

86
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:28,307
THAT’S NOT HOW THE LAW WORKS. IF THEY WERE TRYING TO COME UP

87
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,977
IF THEY WERE TRYING TO COME UP WITH A SCHEME TO PAY HER OFF, TO

88
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:32,512
WITH A SCHEME TO PAY HER OFF, TO KEEP HER QUIET, AND SOMEBODY

89
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:34,013
KEEP HER QUIET, AND SOMEBODY ELSE IS PART OF THAT SCHEME BUT

90
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,214
ELSE IS PART OF THAT SCHEME BUT ULTIMATELY WROTE THE CHECK,

91
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:37,050
ULTIMATELY WROTE THE CHECK, THEY’RE STILL PART OF THAT

92
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:38,017
THEY’RE STILL PART OF THAT SCHEME.

93
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,485
SCHEME. SO, FIRST OF ALL, EVERYONE HAS

94
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:42,489
SO, FIRST OF ALL, EVERYONE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THERE’S THIS

95
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:43,123
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THERE’S THIS POSSIBLE CAMPAIGN FINANCE

96
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,090
POSSIBLE CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION.

97
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:45,291
VIOLATION. AGAIN, IT DOESN’T REALLY MATTER

98
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:47,026
AGAIN, IT DOESN’T REALLY MATTER WHO WROTE THE CHECK OR PAID THE

99
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:47,326
WHO WROTE THE CHECK OR PAID THE CASH.

100
00:02:47,337 --> 00:02:48,962
CASH. YOU CAN BE PART OF A CONSPIRACY,

101
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:50,396
YOU CAN BE PART OF A CONSPIRACY, YOU CAN BE PART OF A SCHEME.

102
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:51,731
YOU CAN BE PART OF A SCHEME. IF YOU’RE PART OF THE PLANNING

103
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:53,733
IF YOU’RE PART OF THE PLANNING OF IT, EVEN IF YOU DON’T

104
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:55,435
OF IT, EVEN IF YOU DON’T ACTUALLY HAND OVER THE MONEY.

105
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:56,903
ACTUALLY HAND OVER THE MONEY. AND THEN THERE’S LIKELY SOME

106
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:58,138
AND THEN THERE’S LIKELY SOME KIND OF FRAUD CLAIM HERE.

107
00:02:58,181 --> 00:03:00,540
KIND OF FRAUD CLAIM HERE. IN SHORT, KAREN McDOUGAL GOT

108
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,940
IN SHORT, KAREN McDOUGAL GOT SCAMMED.

109
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:02,109
SCAMMED. SHE WAS TOLD SHE WAS BEING PAID

110
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:03,810
SHE WAS TOLD SHE WAS BEING PAID FOR ONE THING AND THAT DIDN’T

111
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,145
FOR ONE THING AND THAT DIDN’T TURN OUT TO BE TRUE.

112
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:07,247
TURN OUT TO BE TRUE. SO THIS TAPE IN AND OF ITSELF

113
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:08,215
SO THIS TAPE IN AND OF ITSELF PROBABLY ISN’T GOING TO PROVE

114
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:10,350
PROBABLY ISN’T GOING TO PROVE ALL THAT, BUT IT JUST SOUNDS

115
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:11,885
ALL THAT, BUT IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE IT’S ONE STEP CLOSER TO

116
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:13,553
LIKE IT’S ONE STEP CLOSER TO THIS THEORY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

117
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:15,555
THIS THEORY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BEING

118
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:17,924
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BEING TRUE, AND THAT COHEN POSSESSES

119
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:19,826
TRUE, AND THAT COHEN POSSESSES INFORMATION ABOUT IT.

120
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:20,827
INFORMATION ABOUT IT. THAT’S THE OTHER PIECE OF THE

121
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:22,262
THAT’S THE OTHER PIECE OF THE ICEBERG I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

122
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:24,097
ICEBERG I WAS TALKING ABOUT. >> ONE OTHER THING, WHY WOULD A

123
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:25,665
>> ONE OTHER THING, WHY WOULD A LAWYER RECORD A TWO-MINUTE

124
00:03:25,676 --> 00:03:26,066
LAWYER RECORD A TWO-MINUTE CONVERSATION?

125
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:29,136
CONVERSATION? >> AS WE’VE SAID BEFORE, A

126
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:29,970
>> AS WE’VE SAID BEFORE, A LEGITIMATE LAWYER, A REAL LAWYER

127
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:30,337
LEGITIMATE LAWYER, A REAL LAWYER WOULDN’T.

128
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,272
WOULDN’T. BUT MICHAEL COHEN WAS NOT ACTING

129
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:34,975
BUT MICHAEL COHEN WAS NOT ACTING AS DONALD TRUMP’S REAL LAWYER.

130
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:36,643
AS DONALD TRUMP’S REAL LAWYER. WE’VE BEEN SAYING -- HE WAS HIS

131
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:38,478
WE’VE BEEN SAYING -- HE WAS HIS FIXER, HE WAS REALLY MORE OF A

132
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,080
FIXER, HE WAS REALLY MORE OF A BUSINESSMAN, A HELPER.

133
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:42,883
BUSINESSMAN, A HELPER. AND FOR ANYONE, WHY DOES ANYONE

134
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:44,251
AND FOR ANYONE, WHY DOES ANYONE RECORD PEOPLE’S CONVERSATIONS?

135
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:47,154
RECORD PEOPLE’S CONVERSATIONS? WELL, THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY

136
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:47,722
WELL, THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY’RE UP TO NO GOOD AND

137
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:49,097
THIS IS ANOTHER PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT THE TRUMP TEAM IS

138
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:54,202
EVIDENCE THAT THE TRUMP TEAM IS WILLING TO LIE LATELYBLATANTLY A

139
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:57,405
WILLING TO LIE LATELYBLATANTLY A ANYTHING THEY NEED TO LIE ABOUT.

140
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,842
ANYTHING THEY NEED TO LIE ABOUT. MIMI, THIS IS AN SDNY

141
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:01,309
MIMI, THIS IS AN SDNY INVESTIGATION.

142
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,277
INVESTIGATION. SDNY HAS THESE TAPES.

143
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:04,312
SDNY HAS THESE TAPES. IF THE SDNY COMES ACROSS

144
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:05,980
IF THE SDNY COMES ACROSS SOMETHING THAT IS PERTINENT TO

145
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:06,915
SOMETHING THAT IS PERTINENT TO THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, IS

146
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:09,584
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, IS THERE A SYSTEM IN PLACE WHERE

147
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,219
THERE A SYSTEM IN PLACE WHERE THEY HAND IT OFF TO THE MUELLER

148
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:11,620
THEY HAND IT OFF TO THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION?

149
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:12,187
INVESTIGATION? HOW DOES THAT WORK?

150
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,688
HOW DOES THAT WORK? >> ABSOLUTELY.

151
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,390
>> ABSOLUTELY. YOU OFTEN HAVE COORDINATION

152
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:24,399
YOU OFTEN HAVE COORDINATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT FEDERAL

153
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:25,600
BETWEEN DIFFERENT FEDERAL PROSECUTORI

154
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:26,135
PROSECUTORI PROSECUTORIAL OFFICES.

155
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:26,869
PROSECUTORIAL OFFICES. WITH THIS MUCH AT STAKE THERE’S

156
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:27,703
WITH THIS MUCH AT STAKE THERE’S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THEY’D

157
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:28,837
NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THEY’D WORK WITH MUELLER’S TEAM.

158
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:30,238
WORK WITH MUELLER’S TEAM. I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE

159
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,807
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT DID NOT LEAK

160
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:33,409
SOUTHERN DISTRICT DID NOT LEAK THIS, NOR DO I THINK THE FBI

161
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:33,642
THIS, NOR DO I THINK THE FBI DID.

162
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:34,610
DID. I DON’T KNOW WHO DID, BUT THERE

163
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:37,713
I DON’T KNOW WHO DID, BUT THERE IS A THEORY OUT THERE THAT

174
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:00,636
WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE AND THIS IS SORT OF TO YOUR QUESTION THAT

175
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,371
IS SORT OF TO YOUR QUESTION THAT COHEN IS NOT NECESSARILY

176
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,139

SEPARATE FROM THE WHOLE RUSSIA CONSPIRACY COLLUSION SCANDAL.

178
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:08,244
CONSPIRACY COLLUSION SCANDAL. REMEMBER, COHEN WAS WORKING ON

179
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:09,645
REMEMBER, COHEN WAS WORKING ON TRUMP’S BEHALF UNTIL MUCH LATER

180
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:10,880
TRUMP’S BEHALF UNTIL MUCH LATER THAN ANYONE HAD PREVIOUSLY

181
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:12,681
