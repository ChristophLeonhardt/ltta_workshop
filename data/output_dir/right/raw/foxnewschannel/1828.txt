00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,999
>>  IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD.

2
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:13,067
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS KEEP

3
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:14,302
PROMISING OR HOPING FOR A BLUE

4
00:00:14,302 --> 00:00:15,737
WAVE IN 2018.

5
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:16,971
WITH THAT WE'RE BACK WITH OUR

6
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:19,307
TALK RADIO PANEL.

7
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:22,043
TOM OUT IN OREGON AND RJ IN

8
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:22,510
PENNSYLVANIA.

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,579
THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND.

10
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,581
TOM, TO YOU, HAD LUNCH YESTERDAY

11
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:29,283
WITH A VERY SENIOR DEMOCRATIC

12
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:30,952
FUNDRAISER WHO TOLD ME THAT

13
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:32,420
THEY'RE NOW THINKING THIS

14
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,654
DEMOCRATIC BLUE WAVE MAY BE A

15
00:00:33,654 --> 00:00:35,456
LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A BLUE

16
00:00:35,456 --> 00:00:36,991
RIPPLE.

17
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:37,792
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

18
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,861
>> I THINK THAT THE DEMOCRATS

19
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:41,729
FACE SOME SERIOUS CHALLENGES.

20
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,932
YOU'VE GOT THE COCH BROTHERS

21
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:47,502
DROPPING 400 MILLION IN THIS

22
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:49,270
ELECTION AND IN ADDITION GROUPS

23
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,138
LIKE AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY

24
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:51,005
THAT THEY CONTROL.

25
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:52,540
THE AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

26
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,908
INTERVENING IN A BIG WAY IN A

27
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:57,278
NUMBER OF THESE CASES IN A

28
00:00:57,278 --> 00:00:58,379
NUMBER OF RACES.

29
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,815
ON LEFT, THERE ARE NO BIG MONEY

30
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:02,583
SOURCES, IT'S MOSTLY CROWD

31
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:02,917
SOURCED.

32
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:03,384
LELAND: OKAY.

33
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:04,185
>> IT'S A CHALLENGE.

34
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:05,419
LELAND: WE'VE GOT THE MONEY

35
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:09,924
ISSUE, MIND YOU, THE FUNDRAISER

36
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:12,160
SAYS HE'S GOT MORE MONEY THAN HE

37
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,163
KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH THE WHAT'S

38
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:16,831
STRUGGLING IS THE MESSAGE.

39
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:21,536
AND LISTEN TO CONOR LAMB WHO

40
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:23,237
SAID THIS IN PENNSYLVANIA.

41
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:24,172
>> I DON'T SUPPORT NANCY PELOSI,

42
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:25,473
THE REAL ISSUES ARE THE ONES

43
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:26,207
THAT AFFECT YOUR LIVES.

44
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:27,642
LELAND: WHAT DOES IT SAY THAT

45
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:28,743
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WINNING THE

46
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:30,278
SPECIAL ELECTIONS ARE DOING IT

47
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:33,447
BY REPUDIATING THE DEMOCRATIC

48
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:35,049
LEADERSHIP THAT DEMOCRATS ARE

49
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:36,017
DOUBLING DOWN ON?

50
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:37,885
>> WELL, TO THE BEST OF MY

51
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:38,820
KNOWLEDGE, CONOR LAMB IS THE

52
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,221
ONLY PERSON WHO SAID THAT AND HE

53
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:42,356
WAS SAYING THAT IN RESPONSE TO A

54
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:43,658
WHOLE SERIES OF TELEVISION ADS

55
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:46,060
BEING FUNDED BY OUT OF STATE

56
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,628
BILLIONAIRES THAT SAID THAT, YOU

57
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:49,831
KNOW, IF HE GOT INTO OFFICE HE

58
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:51,432
WOULD BASICALLY BE NANCY

59
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:52,867
PELOSI'S, YOU KNOW, BOY.

60
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,836
AND HE WAS JUST REBUTTING THAT

61
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:57,305
AND YOU KNOW, TO THE EXTENT THAT

62
00:01:57,305 --> 00:01:59,607
THEY'RE DEMONIZING HER, YOU

63
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:01,108
KNOW, PARTICULARLY IN

64
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:02,577
CONSERVATIVE AREAS, THIS IDEA

65
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:04,245
THAT WOMEN SHOULDN'T BE IN

66
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:05,613
POLITICS, WOMEN SHOULDN'T BE IN

67
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:07,782
BUSINESS, YOU KNOW, RESONATES

68
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:09,417
WITH A LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS.

69
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:10,017
>> COME ON.

70
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:11,919
>> SO, IT'S A CHALLENGE, HE'S

71
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,388
PUSHING BACK, BUT BROADLY

72
00:02:14,388 --> 00:02:14,755
SPEAKING.

73
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:18,092
LELAND: HOLD ON, RJ, THAT SEEMS

74
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:24,999
LIKE AN AWFULLY BIG CHASM--

75
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:30,137
>> LOOK HOW MANY ARE VOTED IN AS

76
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:30,571
REPUBLICANS--

77
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,772
>> WE DON'T WANT WOMEN IN

78
00:02:31,772 --> 00:02:32,173
POLITICS?

79
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:33,074
WHERE DO YOU GET THIS MANUAL?

80
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:35,409
>> I REMEMBER THE WAY YOU WENT

81
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:35,977
AFTER HILLARY.

82
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:36,711
>> AND THREE IN SCATTERED

83
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:38,980
SHOWERS AND MEDICARE AND YOU'LL

84
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,150
HAVE THE COMPLETE LIST OF

85
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,818
DEMOCRATIC THINGS, SOCIAL

86
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:44,619
SECURITY.

87
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:47,455
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NOTHING TO

88
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:48,556
MAKE THIS BETTER.

89
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:49,757
GIVE THREE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE

90
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:51,525
SAID OR PROPOSED OR DONE THAT

91
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:53,060
MADE LIFE BETTER IN AMERICA?

92
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,263
THEY'RE NOT THERE, THAT'S WHY

93
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:56,898
THEY'RE GOING TO LOOSE.

94
00:02:56,898 --> 00:02:58,399
>> DEMOCRATS BROUGHT US SOCIAL

95
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,768
SECURITY, MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND

96
00:03:00,768 --> 00:03:03,804
THE REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW

97
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:05,239
TRYING TO DESTROY THOSE.

98
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:05,840
>> HOW MANY YEARS AGO.

99
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,307
>> COME ON.

100
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:08,709
>> THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A 400

101
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:11,913
BILLION CUT TO MEDICARE.

102
00:03:11,913 --> 00:03:13,514
THEY CUT MEDICARE, AND CUTS

103
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:14,482
MONEY OUT OF SOCIAL SECURITY.

104
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:15,950
>> THIS IS A BROKEN RECORD.

105
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,985
YOU GUYS BRING THIS OUT EVERY

106
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:19,854
TIME, AND IT'S NONSENSE.

107
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:21,455
>> AND REPUBLICANS HATED SOCIAL

108
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:22,857
SECURITY SINCE IT WAS CREATED IN

109
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:23,157
1935.

110
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:24,425
>> GIVE ME THREE THINGS THAT

111
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:25,192
DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE TO MAKE

112
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:27,228
AMERICA BETTER, WHAT ARE THE

113
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:28,329
THREE THINGS.

114
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,363
LELAND: TOM, 15 SECONDS.

115
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:30,564
>> WHAT ARE THEY PROPOSING.

116
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:32,533
>> SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE,

117
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:33,301
MEDICAID, DECENT TRADE POLICY.

118
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:35,236
LELAND: ALL OF WHICH ARE NOW

119
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:36,671
BANKRUPT OR GOING BANKRUPT.

120
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,205
WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE.

121
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:38,906
GENTLEMEN, APPRECIATE IT.

122
00:03:38,906 --> 00:00:00,000
AND WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE ABOUT
