1
00:00:04,177 --> 00:00:05,611
RATHER THAN CALL FOR VIOLENT

2
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:08,180
HARASSMENT AND MOB RULE."

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,216
HOLDER IS PREDICTABLY

4
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:11,217
BACKTRACKING.

5
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:13,185
TWEETING "STOP THE OUTRAGE.

6
00:00:13,186 --> 00:00:14,186
I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT ADVOCATING

7
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:14,553
VIOLENCE.

8
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:17,022
IN FACT WHEN I WAS AG, VIOLENT

9
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:18,224
CRIME IN THE U.S. WAS

10
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:19,225
HISTORICALLY LOW.

11
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:21,427
I AM SAYING REPUBLICANS

12
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:22,128
UNDERMINING OUR DEMOCRACY AND

13
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:23,996
DEMOCRATS NEED TO BE TOUGH,

14
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:24,730
PROUD, AND STAND UP FOR THE

15
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:28,601
VALUES WE BELIEVE IN.

16
00:00:28,602 --> 00:00:30,202
THE END."

17
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:31,270
DANA, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

18
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:32,705
REALLY WORKS IN POLITICS IS WHEN

19
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:34,974
YOU MAKE YOUR POLITICAL

20
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:36,809
OPPONENTS FIGHT AMONGST EACH

21
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,176
OTHER.

22
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:38,778
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

23
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:40,179
YOU HAVE MICHELLE OBAMA,

24
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,846
HILLARY, ERIC HOLDER ALL

25
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:42,214
FIGHTING AMONGST EACH OTHER AND

26
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:43,249
THAT HELPS THE RIGHT.

27
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,352
>> Dana: DO KNOW WHO WOULD NOT

28
00:00:46,353 --> 00:00:46,819
HAVE APOLOGIZE?

29
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,388
MICHAEL AVENATTI.

30
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:51,390
I DO THINK THERE'S SOMETHING

31
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:52,858
ABOUT THE WINGS, ESPECIALLY ON

32
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:55,327
THE LEFT WING RIGHT NOW, WANTING

33
00:00:55,328 --> 00:00:55,995
A FIGHTER.

34
00:00:55,996 --> 00:00:57,830
WHY WOULD YOU APOLOGIZE FOR

35
00:00:57,831 --> 00:00:58,397
THAT?

36
00:00:58,398 --> 00:01:01,367
YOU COULD SAY HE GOT A LAUGH OUT

37
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:02,001
OF THE CROWD.

38
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:02,701
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS LOTS OF

39
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:04,970
THINGS TO GET A LAUGH FROM THE

40
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:05,404
CROWD.

41
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:06,539
THE LEFT SAYS WE CAN'T BELIEVE

42
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,840
HE SAID THAT.

43
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:08,641
HE WAS TERRIBLE.

44
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:10,509
NOW THE RIGHT IS SAYING THAT

45
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,811
ABOUT ERIC HOLDER.

46
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:13,112
IT'S ALL ABOUT PROPORTIONALITY.

47
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:14,747
>> Jesse: I AM GOING TO USE

48
00:01:14,748 --> 00:01:18,083
THE FAKE OUTRAGE NEXT TIME.

49
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:19,819
>> Dana: AVENATTI WOULD NOT

50
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,786
HAVE APOLOGIZE.

51
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:21,620
>> Jesse: IT'S FUNNY,

52
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:23,589
DEMOCRATS DEBATING ON WHETHER

53
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:29,028
THE TAKE -- TAKE THE HIGH ROAD.

54
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:30,162
>> Greg: ACCUSING AN INNOCENT

55
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:32,331
MAN OF GANG RAPE IS NOT EXACTLY

56
00:01:32,332 --> 00:01:34,033
THE HIGH ROAD.

57
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:38,003
WHERE DOES --

58
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:40,239
BEFORE I GET INTO MY SERIOUS --

59
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,040
I WILL SAY I BELIEVE WHAT HOLDER

60
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,709
IS SAYING BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN

61
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,010
THE PRINCIPLE THAT YOU DON'T

62
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:48,814
TAKE THE WORST MEANING OR WORST

63
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:49,982
INTENTION OF WHAT SOMEONE IS

64
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:50,316
SAYING.

65
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:52,418
I DON'T BELIEVE HE WAS INCITING

66
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:53,219
VIOLENCE.

67
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,387
HE WAS BASICALLY SAYING FIGHT

68
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:56,622
HARDER.

69
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:57,656
HAVING SAID THAT, ACCUSATIONS OF

70
00:01:57,657 --> 00:01:59,425
INCIVILITY DON'T BUG ME.

71
00:01:59,426 --> 00:02:00,726
I THINK INCIVILITY IS PRETTY

72
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:01,393
GOOD BECAUSE IT REDUCES THE

73
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:03,395
CHANCE FOR VIOLENCE.

74
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:04,997
IF YOU ARE UNCIVIL WITH EACH

75
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:06,398
OTHER, IT MIGHT MEAN YOU MIGHT

76
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:06,765
NOT PUNCH.

77
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:09,802
THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME IS THE

78
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:11,437
INCITEMENT AND ENABLING OF A MOB

79
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:12,605
SO WHEN YOU HAVE NETFLIX

80
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:15,608
EMPLOYEES FOR EXAMPLE STOCKING

81
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:17,643
BRIAN KILMEADE IN ORDER FOR A

82
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:19,945
SHOW ON NETFLIX AND THEN

83
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:20,946
INCITING THE PASSENGERS ON THE

84
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:27,019
SUBWAY TO JOIN IN IN THIS ORGY

85
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,187
OF PERSECUTION.

86
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:29,622
PERSECUTION IS LIKE A CONTAGION.

87
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:32,091
WHEN YOU'RE IN A MOB, IT IS

88
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:32,992
SPREAD THROUGH REPETITION.

89
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:34,426
IT CAN HAPPEN VERY EASILY.

90
00:02:34,427 --> 00:02:36,362
HE THINK WE NEED TO CONTRAST

91
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:36,862
WORDS AND DEEDS.

92
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:38,497
WHAT HOLDER IS SAYING IS USE

93
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:40,199
WORDS BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

94
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
THE DEEDS.

95
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,801
PEOPLE ARE COMPARING

96
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:45,204
DONALD TRUMP, HIS WORDS, TO

97
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:46,205
LEFT-WING DEEDS.

98
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:46,805
I GET IT.

99
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:47,973
TRIM CAN BE RUDE IN HIS JOKES

100
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:49,675
CAN BE MEAN BUT THERE IS NO

101
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:54,146
RIGHT WING ANTIFA OR OCCUPY

102
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:55,848
WALL STREET, NO SCALISE SHOOTING

103
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,951
MORE PEOPLE RIGHT WING CHASING

104
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:02,888
PEOPLE OR RIGHT WING NIGHT FLEX

105
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:03,856
-- NETFLIX.

106
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:06,792
>> Jesse: I DIDN'T THINK

107
00:03:06,793 --> 00:03:07,459
HOLDER WAS LITERALLY TALKING

108
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,429
ABOUT KICKING REPUBLICANS.

109
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,698
I THINK MOST PEOPLE SENSE THAT

110
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:14,600
BUT GREG'S POINT, IN THE CONTEXT

111
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:15,668
OF ALL THE OTHER DEEDS THAT HAVE

112
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:18,604
GONE ON IN THE LAST WEEK, MONTH,

113
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:19,371
YEAR WHERE THERE'S BEEN VIOLENCE

114
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:21,407
AND THREATS AND THINGS LIKE

115
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:22,641
THAT, IT DOESN'T ADD ANYTHING TO

116
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:26,011
THE CONVERSATION IN A POSITIVE

117
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:26,278
WAY.

118
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:28,013
>> Juan: I THINK IT DOES.

119
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:29,582
I THINK BOTH DANA AND GREG SAID

120
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,850
TO YOU, JESSE, THAT WOULD

121
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,419
DEMOCRATS WANT OUR PEOPLE WHO

122
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,454
WILL STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR THE

123
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:35,955
DEMOCRATIC BRAND.

124
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:37,590
RIGHT NOW REPUBLICANS CONTROL

125
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,425
THE WHITE HOUSE, CONGRESS, AND

126
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:40,192
THE SUPREME COURT AND OFTENTIMES

127
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:44,730
THEY FEEL LIKE, REMEMBER THE USA

128
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:47,232
TODAY PIECE.

129
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,034
THAT THE PRESIDENT GETS AWAY

130
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:49,802
WITH SAYING THINGS ARE UNTRUE

131
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:51,904
AND NO ONE STANDS UP AND SAYS

132
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:53,839
THIS GUY IS MISLEADING YOU,

133
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,807
REPUBLICANS.

134
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:56,809
WHERE DID YOU GO, REPUBLICAN

135
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,409
PARTY?

136
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,911
I LISTEN TO YOU GUYS AND I THINK

137
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:00,613
WAIT A SECOND.

138
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:01,847
WHAT KIND OF ONE-SIDED

139
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:03,215
PRESENTATION IS THIS?

140
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:05,818
THIS GUY WAS AT RALLIES AND HE

141
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,853
HAS TO CROWD YELLING "LOCK HER

142
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:09,455
UP."

143
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:10,823
NOT ABOUT HILLARY.

144
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:11,857
ABOUT DIANNE FEINSTEIN.

145
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:12,391
>> Greg: CLEVER.

146
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:14,193
>> Juan: AT THE SAME TIME ONE

147
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:16,362
HOLDER SAYS DEMOCRATS NEED TO

148
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:18,664
STAY

149
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:20,032
STAND UP.

150
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,001
THEN YOU SAY THERE'S NO

151
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:22,601
SHOOTING?

152
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:24,603
STEVE SCALISE, THAT WAS AN

153
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:25,037
ACTIVE HORROR.

154
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:27,106
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THEY WENT INTO

155
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:29,008
A PIZZA PARLOR IN WASHINGTON.

156
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,609
>> Dana: YOU HAVE BROUGHT THIS

157
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,243
UP EVERY TIME.

158
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:33,612
THE PIZZA PARLOR THING.

159
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:35,014
CAN I SAY?

160
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,015
>> Juan: WHAT ABOUT

161
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:37,850
CHARLOTTESVILLE?

162
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:39,885
DID THEY RUN OVER SOMEONE AT

163
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:40,352
CHARLOTTESVILLE?

164
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:41,320
>> Dana: I THINK

165
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:42,254
CHARLOTTESVILLE --

166
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:43,188
>> Greg: LET ME FINISH.

167
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:44,490
WHEN IT COMES TO REPUBLICANS CAN

168
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:45,624
WE HAVE TO BE HONEST.

169
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,625
IT'S A BUG IN THE SYSTEM.

170
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:48,627
WHEN IT COMES TO THE LEFT, IT'S

171
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:49,028
THE SYSTEM.

172
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,431
YOU'VE HAD THE WEATHER

173
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:53,999
UNDERGROUND, SLA, BLACK

174
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,835
PANTHERS, MANSON FAMILY, ANTIFA.

175
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:58,003
REPUBLICANS HAVE NOTHING LIKE

176
00:04:58,004 --> 00:04:58,303
THAT.

177
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:00,205
>> Juan: YOU HAVE WHITE

178
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:01,006
NATIONALISTS.

179
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:03,108
>> Greg: THE OPPOSITE OF WHITE

180
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:03,542
NATIONALISTS.

181
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:07,046
[ALL SPEAKING]

182
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:07,980
>> Jesse: JEDEDIAH, WHAT DO

183
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:10,215
YOU THINK?

184
00:05:10,216 --> 00:05:11,650
>> Jedidiah: YOU BOTH GAVE

185
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:12,851
HOLDER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT

186
00:05:12,852 --> 00:05:14,553
AND THAT'S GREAT AND I PROBABLY

187
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:15,654
WOULD TOO.

188
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:17,289
BUT HE WOULDN'T GIVE YOU -- IF

189
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,658
ONE OF YOU SAID THAT, FORGET IT.

190
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:21,427
I THINK THIS ALL STARTED WITH

191
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:23,529
THE REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THAT TRUMP

192
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,229
HAD WON.

193
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,497
STARTED WITH THAT AND PEOPLE ON

194
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:27,332
THE LEFT SIDE YOU KNOW WHAT,

195
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,968
THIS WAS NOT A PROPER ELECTION.

196
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,638
THEY INCITED EVERYBODY TO SAY

197
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,007
THAT THIS ELECTION WAS NOT

198
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:35,774
TANGIBLE AND THEY SHOULD RALLY

199
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:38,310
AGAINST IT AND IT STARTED WITH

200
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:39,745
MAXINE WATERS.

201
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:41,413
THESE ARE MANY LEADERS IN THE

202
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:41,914
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

203
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:43,549
PEOPLE TALK TO ME ALL THE TIME.

204
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,616
TEA PARTY RALLIES, THE SIGNS

205
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:46,251
THEY SAW AT TEA PARTY RALLIES.

206
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:48,654
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT SIGNS

207
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:51,423
AND HAVE SIGNS OF PEOPLE AT A

208
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:52,091
RALLY, I'VE NEVER FOUND IT

209
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:52,458
OFFENSIVE.

210
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,594
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT

211
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:58,197
COMPARED TO LEADERS IN THE

212
00:05:58,198 --> 00:05:58,931
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, HOLDER,

213
00:05:58,932 --> 00:05:59,798
HILLARY CLINTON WHO COULD HAVE

214
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,400
BEEN PRESIDENT, SAYING

215
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:02,234
OUTRAGEOUS THINGS.

216
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:03,769
GOOD ON MICHELLE OBAMA WHO CAME

217
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,404
OUT AND SAID THIS IS NOT

218
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:06,038
ACCEPTABLE.

219
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:07,106
I'M SURE HILLARY CLINTON WAS NOT

220
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:09,208
HAPPY WITH HER BUT I COMMEND IT

221
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,009
IT WENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS

222
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,211
HAPPENS, IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

223
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:14,046
PEOPLE WITHIN THE PARTY ITSELF

224
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:14,613
TO STAND UP TO IT.

225
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:16,215
ANY DEMOCRAT TO STAND UP TO

226
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:18,350
THIS, I SALUTE THEM AS WELL.

227
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:19,251
>> Juan: I WISH THE

228
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:22,254
REPUBLICANS WOULD STAND UP TO

229
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:23,655
SOME OF THE OUTRAGEOUS --

230
00:06:23,656 --> 00:06:24,623
>> Jedidiah: MANY REPUBLICANS

231
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,158
STAND UP TO DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE

232
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:28,026
SAYS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT

233
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:30,996
APPROPRIATE.

234
00:06:30,997 --> 00:06:31,797
>> Jesse: I WANT TO

235
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:32,831
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WHEN WE

236
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:33,465
ARE TALKING ABOUT.

237
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,734
I DON'T WANT TO LITIGATE LOCAL

238
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:38,003
VIOLENCE BUT GREG WAS PICKING UP

239
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:41,440
A LOT OF EXAMPLES OF I WAS

240
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:43,408
YESTERDAY, LEFT-WING ATTACKS ON

241
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:45,010
REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS, CABINET

242
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:46,779
MEMBERS, TRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS,

243
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,412
ELECTED OFFICIALS.

244
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:49,214
THAT HAS BEEN VIOLENCE

245
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:49,948
PERPETRATED BY THE RIGHT ON THE

246
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,018
LEFT IN THE STREETS, AND THAT'S

247
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:54,419
AWFUL AND RANDOM.

248
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,255
BUT WHEN YOU ARE GOING AFTER

249
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:57,422
POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN A

250
00:06:57,423 --> 00:06:58,123
DEMOCRACY THAT TAKES IT TO A

251
00:06:58,124 --> 00:07:00,559
HIGHER LEVEL AND I THINK THAT'S

252
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,628
THE DIFFERENCE.

253
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,430
>> Juan: GOING AFTER POLITICAL

254
00:07:05,431 --> 00:07:05,831
LEADERSHIP?

255
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:07,866
>> Jesse: RICIN, THREATS

256
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,134
AGAINST FAMILY MEMBERS, CHASING

257
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:12,037
THEM AROUND IN THE STREETS.

258
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:12,838
THAT'S AN ATTACK ON POLITICAL

259
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,041
LEADERSHIP AND NOT SOMETHING --

260
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:18,010
DRIVING INTO A CAR OR SHOOTING

261
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:19,645
UP A RANDOM PIZZA PLACE.

262
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:21,246
I'M NOT EXCUSING IT.

263
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:22,447
I'M SAYING IT'S DIFFERENT

264
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:22,881
CATEGORICALLY.

265
00:07:22,882 --> 00:07:24,049
>> Juan: IT'S DIFFERENT IF

266
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,218
SOMEONE STANDS UP AND SAYS I

267
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:27,252
DISAGREE WITH YOU.

268
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:28,420
I THINK MITCH MCCONNELL, WHAT

269
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:30,022
YOU DID, I'M IN THIS AIRPORT AND

270
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:33,258
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU HEAR

271
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:33,625
IT.

272
00:07:33,626 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Jedidiah: HARASSING
