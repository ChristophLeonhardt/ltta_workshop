the landmark conviction of jean-pierre Bemba for war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court in The Hague has now been overturned mr. Babur cannot be held criminally responsible under Article 28 for the crimes committed by an Dulce troops during the car operation the former rebel leader and vice-president of the Democratic Republic of Congo has spent nearly a decade behind bars he was sentenced to 18 years in prison after sending his militia to the Central African Republic to help put down a coup attempt they conducted a reign of terror a rampage of looting and killing of civilians followed including the mass rape of hundreds of women but a majority of the judges ruled on his appeal he could not be held responsible for the actions of his fighters his lawyers argued successfully the fighters were no longer under his command after they crossed the international border his militia known as the movement for the liberation of Congo has now been transformed into a political party opposing the rule of President Joseph Kabila he is called an election which is due to take place in December I'm David cheetah in Belgium the country that was the former colonial ruler of the Democratic Republic of Congo ever since it gained its independence in 1960 there's never been a peaceful transfer of power in that country the senator is returning from Belgium to his homeland to register as a candidate in the presidential elections jean-pierre Bemba talks to al jazeera jean-pierre Bemba thank you very much for talking to Al Jazeera thank you I'd like to start with perhaps the hardest question for you during those 10 years inside you were always convinced that you didn't have criminal responsibility for the atrocities committed by bio militia you were convinced always that you were going to come out an innocent man but during those 10 years did you have any feelings about your moral responsibility for what happened I think that of course I have a lot of sympathy for all the people in the Central Africa in general bangy and my brother sisters and of course if any victim and I'm very sad and I'm supporting I mean all this the pain but as you say I've been acquitted by professional judge by experienced judge unless the judge and that's what I can say that's all the judge has been said and when when you head back are you gonna have a special message are you going to actually say that you feel sorry for what happened that you have sympathy for the victims and you want to start on a clean slate of course have a lot of sympathy for all victim or whatever victim it is I met what I had to say that I'm going back to Congo I'm not going to Central Africa and as a Congress that you know I'm a senator in Congo and former vice president so as the chairman of my political party and the next candidate from a political party I'm going to take part of the community political before you arrest you spoke to one of my colleagues in al Jazeera and you were in Portugal you feared for the safety of yourself and your family surely you must fear for your own safety on your return what do you feel about that no I think that I remember I met one of your colleague 10 years ago it was in Portugal and I talked to him as I always says that I have nothing to fear because my conscience was clean and the true has been said and of the day the justice has been said do you think that President Joseph Kabila will hold the elections in December really I never heard from himself that you will hold election but I've never heard that so that he will not hold election I just heard that who will respect the Constitution so as the government of the Constitution I will hope that he will make respect the Constitution looking at your time in prison were you devastated by what continued to happen in the Congo I'm really devastated time varies I'm very sad because it's a disaster humanitarian disaster it's an economic disaster the final disaster I mean look at the problem we had in Casa is a massive comedy in Kasai I'm talking about Kim Jong Il so this EDF attack in a beanie Ron Putin bow new massacre in it to remember in the 2001 in the marsh I've restored the peace and security in Italy so I know very well this problem in Ettore and it's start again a few months ago the problems of the EDF we thought iphoto the IDF in the 2001 when I was in a beanie so really I feel sorry that all these old insecurity is back now in Congo the latest UNICEF report that I saw beginning this year said there was something like 800,000 children who don't have homes anymore they don't have education they don't have access to health what are you going to do to give them a future I think as you know we have it on the children whoever so more than six million refugees or around the the countries around at DRC so we should find the best way to bring them back home and that's what I say the problem is the security that's why one of my priority my program is to restore peace and security without peace and security they will not come back and I saw the same problem with the children children has to be have assistance in a different way and chin I have to go in school and not to be in a refugee camp or in the street so I'm very very very concerned about this project yes how are you going to do that they've been so many promises to try and solve the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo but there's still a huge amount of inter-ethnic violence that is one of the reason one I'm a candidate for the second time remember the tablets of community 2006 so after being a vice-president in Congo I know more than anybody did kind of problem that we are in the opposition is a kind of problem that we face in Congo so all these crisis and this humanitarian problem if we have to face that one it is a problem of a political win if we focus if a government tomorrow say we are going to take care and solve this problem and put the means to solve the problem and to face this problem we'll be able to do it but today I never hear any action from the government today to try to find a solution just to bring the refugee back to Congo I never heard about it just to fade this problem of the children that the UNICEF have focus on 800,000 children you know without family that is a problem of a political will so you have to put it on the table of a government but that's what I say I'm fighting to offer a new government to be able tomorrow to have a new government through the election since the DRC gained its independence in 1960 there has never been a peaceful transfer of power do you think there will be this time I hope so are still up so even if I know that the two major problem that we have to serve with the Electoral Commission the problem of this machine of electronic vote machine that something has never been used anywhere in the world we don't understand why it should be testing Congo even the the test made with to machine in the assembly national assembly and in the Electoral Commission was a disaster the settlement problem we have is this 10 million elector we are seen without no fingerprint so this program have to be solvent because you go to the election otherwise what is the the sense of an election where the day after the vote will be contest forward I think Congo need the stabilization and stability Etta we started with a peaceful electoral process do you think that President Kabila will be worried that you will focus the opposition forces and change the corruption change everything about the DRC do you think he really opposed and determined to make sure that you don't succeed don't capitalize a nanniversary I mean in the politic I think that the most important for me is what the people of Congo want and if I'm doing politic is to first solve a problem for the people of Congo that is what I'm the most interesting so of course I understand that some people may be worried about but they shouldn't I mean I'm just someone trying to find solution for his country that's all and for the people of his country who are my brother and sister but you're going to register as a candidate by the deadline and already the government is saying that you're not you're not going to be able to be registered that it's illegitimate for you to be registered as a candidate that's surely the first problem you've got yeah but are you surprised that the government in place say that I'm not able so you shouldn't be surprised I think that those people in the majority of the government I'm not the right people able to talk about it as ago after 10 years in in at a criminal limbo as it were did you feel that you'd made a mistake that you should have been during those 10 years what did you feel about those 10 years where they wasted years or did you like Nelson Mandela concentrate your thoughts on what you're going to do when you got out I returned the fact that these 10 years helped me resort to think deeply about not just myself but also my country of course you are not the same person after 10 years you Congo has changed the African change the word has change so you have to adapt yourself and sinker for differently of course 10 years more make you be another man also but it's true that I use all that opportunity time to think about Congo and how to solve a lot of problems Congo I wrote a program for a vision for Congo that will very soon give it to the public so yes 10 years can make you be another man give me some idea of what that vision is what sort of measures I think that the coalition we have in common that is a very wealthy country very wealthy country that we have but look at the poverty of the people so it is a big contradiction so why do we have all these wells in the ground and the people living in this country are so poor the main target I have is to say look let make these wells that we have be use for the good of the people to improve the life of the people to give up to the people to make them smile again is there any way the international community can help of course you and a section in in a Congo it is huge and I help a lot the L people in security today if money that you and without their probably that the national army would have certain problem to stop a discretion of ADF and all this militia more than eighty militia exist in Congo so I think the International Committee our help in Congo and I hope that they will continue helping Congo why is it but it is true that Congo and one day Congolese government must be able to solve all this problem also why is it a country it is so often the case it has bountiful natural resources they turn out to be a curse you can see that a lot of the production is there but the result of the revenue is not coming back to the Treasury of the country and that is why is the problem why is it going for who and one of the action to put is to take back all this revenue back to the Treasury of the country and you will see it from this Treasury that we can develop the country and by restoring the security people will be able investor from foreign investor national investor will be able to come back to Congo and give employment invest get their profit and then I think how Congo will be developed tomorrow during your ten years in inside the political scene has changed so dramatically perhaps most of all with President Trump what's what's your opinion of the President of the United States of America I think that is all the decisions are made by the American people I cannot give my view say they do well or not it's okay what we would like to see because I have not yet seen yet what is the view of present track for DRC how far and how fast will you start reforming the systems within the country are you going to just rely on your own party or are you going to reach across and try and get a unified government this country is so huge 18 million people we have more than 400 political party I don't say that for the 400 are really mean but we have less than 10 mean little party and I think that we have to work to everybody and my target is to work with a united government do you intend to be the main opposition candidates who will you step aside for somebody else both solution I represent my program my plan with the others and if I'm not the best one I will back someone else and I'm sure will make him win what message will you have for President Kabila just to respect the Constitution make sure that we keep the stability of the country the peace in the country and then make everything be possible to have a smooth transition in this DRC for the next election will you reform the security forces how are you going to pull it together what is your plan for that how do we stop the terror that so many children and so many people in your country are feeling right now most of the the people are appointed because of tribal tribal reason I think it's wrong for the country I think I will appointed people because of their professionalism and the capacity and it will be another mentality completely change in the vision of what should be an army a police I test it during five years during the rebellion I told all the soldiers you must be friend of the people you are here to secure them you must feel the people not the people to fear you so what would you say to the children in the east of the Congo now you haven't got a home haven't got health and education but you message to them right now that they should have still up hope that something may change before the end of this year in the new government education must be free for me from the primary school until the secondary school and the government must be able to give and to provide to the children free education absolutely that is one of the purity to put more than 10% of the the budget in the education is not a luxury what are you gonna do about the judiciary and do you think that there should be any charges brought against your predecessors justice should be independent and the term of independence is very important because it's an institution and it can it cannot be lead by the government it should be completing a body completely independent must have the means to say the law independently that is really for me what is the most important why because you cannot have even in Vatsa coming in Congo or in fester inside Congo if you don't provide a transparent justice and justice for everybody that's not the case today for the princess how we say that he has the immunity as a former president and it is protect his protected by the Constitution but you're a successful businessman yourself do you think you can get the inward investment into the country that's needed with such an unstable security situation that's what I keep telling you that one of my first target is to restore security and peace in Congo because nowhere in any country not in serious investor will come if there are no peace and security in the country what do you love most about your country what have you missed most about the country I will say the contact with the people the fight that I was in like an ICC couldn't allow me to go and meet and be with the people so in that case when you get back are you going to go on a tour of the whole country not this moment we are not yet in the electoral process but of course keep contact with the people and be with them be in touch with them yes be in contact with them talk with them face to face what's your first priority then when you land you know that I lost my father nine years ago I couldn't bury him so my first duty is to see his grave the second thing is to go to the electric Commission and I gave my my paper to be able to be candidate for the electoral process what action would you take if they refuse to accept your candidacy I mean all my best gesture it never happened because it will be arbitrary and it will be another arbitrary decision what can we do if they reject your application there's a danger of violence once again isn't there I hope not I hope not because it will be arbitrary and the people we see the arbitrary so I don't know the reactor and liberation of the people I don't know and if you do make it through as the president do you think that you can withstand the pressures that every other president has had in the Congo it's such a powerful position there's so much to do do you think you will be overwhelmed do you how do you think that you'll be able to cope with the pressures of that position I know that will not be easy but the experience that I have will say that I will try to go through and dialogue and I hope and determination will make us succeed I hope so how much will you draw on other African leaders to help you in that task if you do make it through the elections Africa is one body one body in the sense that we Congo shame nine border with a different country in the Central Africa and I think that is very important that we keep a good relationship with all this border first of all all our neighbor because we have the same kind of problem we cannot leave my house and in DRC I think the future of Congo is to be open to first the neighbor and above the neighbor to the notes and also the south we are in the central of Africa and looking looking over the European Union as you must have read during your time in prison there are a lot of pressures on the European Union but you think the European Union can help you as well help the Democratic Republic they help the Democratic Republic of Congo the colony helping I know it is difficult for them today because of the government we are stopping them to help but I think they're really willing to help we not stop helping I took about together about the England and America and saw the big support are giving big support in different sector like humanitarian also through the NGO I know they act a lot about this one and probably they can do more if our government also to European Union and to other organization what about the United Nations they have a huge peacekeeping contingent in there will you cheer when they finally leave because you will have solve the situation surely it's a mark of dishonor to have so many members of the peacekeeping colder yeah there are so many why there's so many because I think that the gun are not taking seriously the consideration of the problem that we're facing and the people of color facing that's why they are there they are there to help the Congo and of course if the doing a lot of job and work and duty that should be made by the Congolese government and we have to work with them closely and see now and how this government can new government I hope tomorrow will be able to endure all the situation during your time as vice president what do you think the most important political lessons were that you learned that Congo has a big potential and really with a strong government turn on the way that we should help the people and make program to help the people this country in the five years can be another picture completely another picture unfortunately the government are the one responsible of insecurity and violence they could really make things much easier for everybody the security system security system is it is the main just to oppress the people and that is wrong and it immediate the people so yes that is really wrong and finally looking back looking back on the International Criminal Court in The Hague do you have any sense of bitterness about what happened to you really the idea of ICC is a good idea of that that no impunity I mean in the world and for the the Moskva matter and so probably things can be improved in term of the management but I wouldn't like to under Adam at the moment on this aspect prefer to keep it like this jean-pierre Bemba thank you very much for talking to Al Jazeera thank you you
