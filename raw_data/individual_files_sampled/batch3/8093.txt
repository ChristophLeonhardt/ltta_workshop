Bill: SELF-PROCLAIMED SOCIALIST ALEXANDRIA LONG TIME DEMOCRAT IS IN HOW ARE YOU, SIR? I'M DOING GREAT. YOU DESERVE IT. YOU WENT TO SCHOOL IN BERKELEY. YOU'RE FROM CALIFORNIA. SHE IS OUT THERE PITCHING FOR VOTES AND TRYING TO RAISE MONEY. EXACTLY. IT'S LESS ABOUT HER AND MORE ABOUT THIS DISTURBING MESSAGE THAT HOW MANY PEOPLE UNDER 30 AND 40 KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT THE LEGACY OF SOCIALISM AND THE SUFFERING IT'S CAUSED. IT IS AN INTERESTING CONTRAST. WHEN YOU LOOK AT HER, SHE IS CHARMING, YOUNG AND HAS A FUTURE. WHAT SHE IS SELLING IS THE OPPOSITE. SOCIALISM IS GRIM, IT'S OLD, MESSAGE HE OFFERS IS NOT LIKABLE. WHAT INFURIATES ME MORE ABOUT CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK CITY. THEY FLOURISH BECAUSE OF LIBERALS THAT GOT RICH AN CAPITALISM. IT GOT THEM TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN PUT THESE HORRIBLE IDEAS ON US. THE INEQUALITY IN CALIFORNIA IS INSANE. PELOSI ESTATE VERSUS THE TENT Bill: I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE. BERNIE IS 70 SOMETHING? HE DOESN'T LOOK A DAY OVER THEY ARE THEY SEEM FRESH AND INNOVATIVE BUT THEIR IDEAS ARE DESTRUCTIVE AND OLD. SALESMAN TO SELL BAD STUFF. I DON'T I WOULDN'T MOCK HER TOO MUCH. SHE IS GOING TO GET BETTER. THE MORE YOU MOCK SOMEBODY, THE BETTER THEY GET. YOU LEARNED WITH TRUMP. Bill: I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE YOU WRITE ALL OF YOUR OWN STUFF. EVERY WORD. YES. Bill: AND I'M TOLD WHEN YOU WORK OUT IN THE GYM YOU CARRY A CLIPBOARD WITH YOU, BECAUSE IF YOU GET AN IDEA YOU WRITE IT DOWN. I STAND ON THE STAIR CLIMBER AT THE GYM WITH THIS THING AND I WRITE ALL THE IDEAS I HAVE AND THEN I JUST KEEP WRITING BECAUSE I HATE EXERCISING. Bill: YOU ARE AFRAID OF LOSING THE IDEA ONCE IT LEAVES YOUR MIND AND IT IS GONE. NOTHING WORSE THAN HAVING AN IDEA, I HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT AND IT'S GONE AND FLOATING SOMEWHERE AND YOU SIT THERE. Bill: YOU ARE AGGRAVATED BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BRING IT BACK. IT DRIVER'S LICENSE DRIVES ME NUTS. PLEASE STOP YOU WALKING PLANK OF REPURPOSED WOOD. JOHN KERRY. IT WAS THE WALKING PLANK OF WOOD THAT GAVE IT AWAY. Bill: RE PURPOSED WOULD. PERINO, SHE IS SO SMALL SHE COULD FLOAT ON A CHEESE IT. I REVERSE THEM. LIKE A GUM DROP IS DANA'S MEDICINE BALL WHERE AS WITH THE BOOK IS OUT. GUTFELD MONOLOGUES. I ADDED NEW INFORMATION. MORE NEW THAN OLD. RIDE ON THAT WAVE. Bill: HE SAW YOU COMING A MILE AWAY.
