they are young vulnerable girls from Myanmar's rural villagers desperately poor they're sold of vision of money and adventure all they have to do is sign up to become maids in Singapore but for many the reality is far darker I'm Steve Chow on this episode of 101 East we find out why girls who are too young to work continue to be trafficked to Asia's most prosperous nation in May last year a young domestic worker from Mira had a terrifying fall from the ninth floor of this block of flats in Singapore her employer whom we will call John can still remember that day a banker thought you said malice orgy total de Cielo palace Tom Thornton too eager shiatsu sunlight is so or Fatiha what you confiscate her solji not touching a book I seen a book I think on a two pallets on white juices young see I see a woman who shall seem to Joe Lord yelled out he Allah the girl who John knows us Tintin was severely injured and is lucky to be alive her fall was broken by a covered walkway two stories down John says he was initially very angry about what she'd done but then he found out something shocking from the Myanmar embassy Tintin was just 15 years old what on earth yo hidden tight heat heart ipod signature uncle Ian eager sincerity honest and true like Cindy a poor control now common decision he boots and so sorry it straight out suit out Saddam when he fastened John and his wife hired Tintin through a Singaporean employment agency called asset recruitment according to this information sheet prepared by the company she was 23 years old asset recruitment declined repeated requests for comment on Eamon she starts getting young kennyman funnyman juice or an foods canoe young so I don't eat at her and in cuyahoga opposed to the three sheets on red sari thing that you cheat without a guarantee but Tintin's is not an isolated case in 2016 in an exclusive investigation 101 East revealed that teenage girls were being trafficked from Myanmar to Singapore for domestic work do you also say this was despite laws in Myanmar banning all female citizens from seeking such jobs overseas following reports of abuse as well as laws in Singapore stipulating that all foreign domestic workers have to be at least 23 years old now we're discovering that the illegal trafficking of vulnerable young girls continues we see at least one case a month of underage Burmese domestic worker these would be those that are under the legal minimum required age of 23 a number of these would be 18 and below meaning they are teenagers yes so that's a conservative estimate there would likely be significant underreporting so there are some domestic workers we strongly suspect underage but they may not admit to being underage for any domestic worker who has been abused seeking help can be a daunting prospect many oh they're agents hefty recruitment fees of up to eight months salary and would rather injure ill treatment than risk being sent home in debt I believe there would also be underage Burmese domestic workers who are trapped in households and do not know how to seek help so that's also another factor in the underreporting of such cases some cases end in tragedy just four weeks after arriving here domestic worker wine wine allegedly jumped out of the window of her employer's 18th floor flat at a funeral we meet her older sister Cho Cho who also came to Singapore as a domestic worker a volunteer from a migrant workers NGO helps to translate but we don't get to speak further as cha-cha is led away by officials from the Myanmar embassy to find out the truth about

cope with being away from home she quit only a month after leaving Myanmar her mother tells us another of her daughters is still working in Singapore for the better part of the interview talking to

shows us the passport she used to get a job in Singapore almost all the information in it is false at home she's known as zinzin and she was born in 2002 not 1993 she confirms what happened to her in Singapore yeah I mean unless you are a regime are you appalled denied a turn i reading i wanna me Halima kochava no contaminates the grammar chair now at an MP record our Jean Jean Jean about who you

care of her instead moodini I'm never in detaining a video that easily cincin fractured her spine when she fell but is now able to walk slowly of the donors paid for her to have surgery but she may need another operation soon the other donor Luminara she shows us her scars it's unlikely they'll ever go away but how did a 15 year old pass for 23 we've received a tip-off about the person who allegedly helped to make this happen do you know this man nope you have it all doing a minute I'm Matt Davis the man in the picture is Lois zone clay tongue he is a member of parliament from Myanmar's qin state an online search tells us he's also the director of a company called Myanmar global manpower link the company name sounds awfully familiar we've seen it before on a sign inside the recruitment agency in Yangon that we discovered in 2016 was illegally sending girls to Singapore he also said girls this was despite Myanmar's ban on women working overseas as domestic workers the website for the company lists several phone numbers when we cross-checked them against the contact list of the country's politicians we find a match one of the numbers belongs to Louis zone clay Tong we decide to give him a call we try the second number on the website this time we have better luck our researcher says she's looking to send a 19 year old domestic worker to Singapore and a friend has recommended their agency but the woman says she's no longer able to help Louis if what she says is true Lewis song was managing director of a company involved in illegally sending domestic workers to Singapore in contravention of the 2014 ban to find out more we traveled to the outskirts of Yangon were looking for the office of Myanmar global manpower link according to the address on the company's website this should be it inside a man refuses to speak on camera but he tells us the house was leased by an employment agency which moved out recently the neighbors proved more approachable although they asked us to hide their identities we show them a picture of Luis and ask if they've seen or recognize him we use it with the Rothman dilemma Oh when 101 east spoke to Lewis song he confirmed he was the managing director of Myanmar global manpower link until 2015 and remained a director until 2016 he tonight knowing the company was involved in illegal activities and rejected all of Zins ins allegations but he did admit to owning the house where the company had its office and that he had visited recently agencies in the business of moving underaged girls overseas need one thing passports with fake birth dates a street near the Yangon passport office is host to a thriving industry for a fee passport brokers can help clients circumvent all sorts of bureaucratic hassles and apparently even a few laws we randomly choose one and tell her our cover story were trying to send a 19 year old domestic worker to Singapore a second broker we approach is equally direct to my social media with so many people making money off this illegal trade it's hard to stem the tide and local labor activist mama who says that blanket ban is doing more harm than good core 12 o nthe neelu machine monopsony aluminum so yeah nearly time you moved on can I move I'm Anika Kalani solution Oh Katya we cut up Oviedo think Tony there when creeping my yahoo yard or Lu ending it she says the situation is also more nuanced than it appears child labor is not uncommon in Myanmar and domestic workers here can be as young as 11 years old d-money below child on TV yo bro Chak De India me cornered enemies or ajamu druga revealing jacquelina way sorry yes Agha who yo G Bureau people trophy no no no chance in life at Myanmar's labor department we learn that government is acutely aware of the trafficking that's happening under its nose but spokesperson kinway who says her department can only track the 130 women who went legally to work in Singapore before the ban it's harder to help if an underage girl leaves Myanmar illegally really really agency and here are the others a mama borrow da da da dong say mama ba ba ba reproduce in Italian oh and you know ah teach Anatomy aha reagents anything to add or clear similarity more than a year to opinion le no to one will you will sound oh you read or Prytania drove downtown with you I'm Italian too damaged it appears that when there are cases of exploitation and abuse the labor department expects the traffickers to look after the girls they traffic we asked if Myanmar and Singapore are working together to solve the problem and I roll airborne auntie Annette abbulu tomorrow by Babur no Atiawa not remain solution but you don't see me be a real MC mom oppa move out there are no gyoja back in Singapore it's clear to see the ban isn't working every week hundreds of domestic workers from Myanmar gather here to enjoy their day off most if not all of them have managed to circumvent the ban some look like they are still in their teens when we raised the issue with Singapore's Ministry of Manpower they responded in writing saying the passport remains the primary document for identification and age verification it is thus important for authorities in the source country to ensure the accuracy of the details in the passport it's four months since her sister's death and cha-cha is still grieving when we first met at the funeral she told us wine wine was 23 or 24 but now she says she was too scared to reveal the truth there me and my agent had instructed her to lie them I think it's hard letting go cha-cha still can't believe her sister killed herself doing it ha I made a payments here and now buy me a wine it ain't a video I'm finally deal the two sisters never got a beat in Singapore chore chore had been trying for days to reach wine wine when she received news of her death that was nearly four months ago but she still doesn't know what happened we've come to the condominium where wine wine was working and where she'd allegedly jumped 18 floors to her death chocho is hoping to meet her sister's employer but she's scared to go inside so we offer to make the initial approach for her but the employer doesn't want to meet your chore instead she tells security to throw us out family of your former domestic workers you want to find out should I kill the sister is more interesting the confrontation she just wants to know what happened to her younger sister sorry yeah what happened excuse me stop here wait no stop white wine was only 17 when she died cha-cha doesn't think she'll ever know why do people know the adiga Darwin see I did not I guarantee you are my darling you do know maybe me well maybe I'm going to see you she regrets not trying harder to reach wine wine but most of all she regrets not telling her underage sister to stay at home
