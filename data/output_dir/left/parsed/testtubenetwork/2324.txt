Sittwe, Myanmar
For decades, Buddhist locals have persecuted
the minority Rohingya Muslim community.
In 2012, sectarian violence against the Rohingya
forcibly displaced 140,000 people.
Human Rights Watch has called the situation
an “ethnic cleansing.”
Some Buddhists have justified the violence
as a preemptive response to the rise of an
Islamic State.
In February 2015, Rohingya voting rights were
repealed after protests from right wing Buddhist
groups.
Myanmar law denies the Rohingya people citizenship,
limits them to two children, and restricts
travel.
