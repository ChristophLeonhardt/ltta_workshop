1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,930
This is the idea that
took over the world.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,340
First there was one democracy —

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,840
then 10, then 20.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,090
There were some setbacks,

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,400
but people really seemed
to want democracy.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,620
And eventually, most
of them got one.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,680
But 15 years ago,
democracy stopped spreading,

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,510
and it might not
pick back up again.

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,270
Even some places that
seemed safely democratic

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,480
turned out not to be.

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,740
And people are even
getting worried

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,950
about established
democracies like the U.S.

13
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,972
So is there something
wrong with democracy?

14
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:34,350
I’m Max Fisher.

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,061
I’m Amanda Taub.

16
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:36,810
We’re journalists at
The New York Times.

17
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,570
And this is the Interpreter.

18
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,190
We can measure democracy
kind of like a health score.

19
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,200
Over here, there
are full democracies

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,190
like the United States.

21
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,430
And over there are
dictatorships like North Korea.

22
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,040
So the further
left a country is,

23
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,290
the less democratic it is and the
further right a country,

24
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,930
the more democratic it is.

25
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,640
Now let’s see what
happens when we

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,610
add how rich the countries are.

27
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,989
The higher on the graph,
the richer the country

28
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,420
and the lower on the graph,
the poorer the country.

29
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,910
Generally, countries
have moved up and right.

30
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,695
As they got richer, they
became more democratic.

31
00:01:12,695 --> 00:01:15,420
You’ve got your Englands,
your Latvias, your Indonesias.

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,267
You see a pattern?

33
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:17,350
Countries getting richer.

34
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,130
Countries getting
more democratic.

35
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,090
But look at countries like
China and Saudi Arabia.

36
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,790
They got richer, but
never got more democratic.

37
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,680
Look at Russia and Venezuela.

38
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,780
They got democratic,
but then backslid,

39
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,040
which wasn’t supposed to happen.

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,020
So what’s going on?

41
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,180
China looked exactly
like places we thought

42
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,650
would become democracies next.

43
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,290
They built up the rule
of law, civil society

44
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,520
and some institutions.

45
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,400
Normally, those are the building
blocks that eventually add up

46
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,420
to democracy.

47
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,480
But they were really designed
to make citizens just happy

48
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,820
enough to protect the
authoritarian system

49
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,710
from the will of the people.

50
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,139
And whenever the
government feels

51
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:00,305
like it could lose control,

52
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:03,560
it uses the other side of its
strategy: violent oppression

53
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,510
and coercion.

54
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,220
We’re seeing this
in more places where

55
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,460
dictators are learning how to
stop democracy from forming.

56
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,920
And at the same time,
some elected leaders

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,690
are developing
their own playbook

58
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,270
for pulling democratic
systems down from within.

59
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,150
A handful of seemingly
established democracies

60
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,260
are sliding back
towards dictatorship.

61
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,680
These countries didn’t
have coups or invasions.

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,350
In each case, voters
elected strongman leaders

63
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,810
who dismantled their
democracies from within.

64
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,630
Venezuela had been
democratic for 40 years,

65
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,790
then Hugo Chavez
rose on a message

66
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,560
that only he spoke
for the people.

67
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,350
People cheered as he
accrued power for himself,

68
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,380
jailed his opponents
and tore down

69
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,890
the democratic institutions
that constrained him.

70
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,780
And when the dust settled,
Chavez was unchecked.

71
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,580
Society descended
into chaos that

72
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,670
is getting worse every day.

73
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,500
Other elected leaders are
using similar tactics,

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,870
but always bit by bit —

75
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,360
in ways that aren’t
obvious and might even

76
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,530
be popular at the time.

77
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,980
One of the most
powerful forces that

78
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,820
can turn people against
democracy is polarization.

79
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,870
When people feel scared enough
of their political opponents,

80
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,550
it feels more important to
protect their side than it

81
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,440
does to protect democracy.

82
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,240
Leaders can exploit that fear.

83
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,820
So if you’re Russian
and you support Putin,

84
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,530
you might blame
society’s problems

85
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,340
on gay people or
nefarious Western plots.

86
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,330
If you’re Turkish
and support Erdogan,

87
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,570
you fear the secular elites
will impose military rule.

88
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,120
And we’re seeing that kind
of polarization and fear

89
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,460
start to take hold in
established democracies.

90
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,400
"You are a racist,
no good American."

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,850
"I was just called a racist."

92
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,020
Could it happen in
the United States?

93
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,500
It still feels impossible.

94
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,570
And it might be.

95
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,030
So far, the system is resilient.

96
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,130
But the warning signs are here.

97
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,940
Polarization.

98
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,690
Populism.

99
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,160
Distrust of institutions.

100
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,860
A desire for strongman
leaders to smash the system.

101
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,940
These things don’t necessarily
mean that democracy is doomed.

102
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,420
But they show that in
times of social stress,

103
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,820
even a free people can
dismantle their own democracy

104
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,290
without realizing
they’re doing it.

105
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,760
Democracy is still a pretty
new system of government.

106
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,860
That century-long trend might
not have been a trend at all.

107
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,920
Just a few one-time moments that
we mistook for inevitability.

108
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,960
We want to believe it
will last forever,

109
00:04:44,960 --> 00:00:00,000
but we can’t be sure.
