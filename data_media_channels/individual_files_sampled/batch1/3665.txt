so let me start off by making the the obvious observation the digital is taking over it is inheriting the earth five years ago this was controversial now it is happening our friends at emarketer Jeff is right here put together this wonderful chart showing the media consumption habits year by year of folks in the US and and basically what you find is if you go by year by year every other medium other than digital is shrinking in terms of the overall percentage of media consumption and digital is growing and the piece of digital that is still growing now is mobile so that is where the action really is and then the second thing when you really look into it is what you find is that this is a generational shift yes people my age and older have gotten smartphones and are starting to consume more media on it but turns out that media habits die hard I still sit on the couch and turn on the TV and watch generally sports with the sound off but I do that because that's what I was raised to do my children watch way more television content than I ever did in fact it's horrifying to see how much they consume but they never watched linear television ever it is always what I see when I saw last night when I got home and I was so excited to go say hello to my teenage daughter and how is she doing and she's in bed with her computer and her smartphone oh she's working so hard it's great then I see what's actually on the computer is some season of whatever shows she has been binge watching on Netflix the phone is Instagram and she's actually doing her homework on paper so this is the sort of environment that my wife and I are dealing with we think it's so great that we get our children all these great smart devices and then this is what happens to them so this is very much a generational shift and over the next 10 to 20 years seems very unlikely that my daughters and that generation are gonna suddenly develop a desire to go watch linear television they're probably gonna take their habits with them and ultimately the big disruption will happen when today's 16 to 24 year olds are the mass-market in 10 years but it'll happen slowly over time in advertising what we see is year by year digital is growing everything else is flat or down and when you get into digital what you find is that it has become a duopoly there's Google Facebook and then everybody else and I was in advertising conference recently with with WPP and Martin Sorrell pretty much every speaker on the stage Martin would say please snapchat tell me that you are the third option so we have some leverage with Google and Facebook and snapchat made a compelling case that in fact they will be that third option but everybody is desperate for another big player because it is very much a duopoly and to really underscore that some of these numbers came out recently in the United States in first half of the year what you found is if you look at the growth of digital on the Left you're very impressive 20% growth and advertising spending in digital year-over-year Google up 23% huge number on such a big business Facebook up a staggering 68 percent but then when you do the math everybody else was down 2% in digital so we are fighting for the crumbs that Facebook and Google send our way the good news is every year they send more and more our way so we're very grateful for that and really they're becoming the distributors of the age the Comcast's and so forth of the of the digital age but they are capturing the lion's share and more so the big trend that we are now going to increasingly talk about year over year is the is the bells sort of tolling for TV for the last 20 years digital disruption has been primarily about print the next 20 years and I think it'll take 20 years it'll be primary about primarily about television some charts on that traditional TV pay TV is past its peak we're down from about 86 percent to 82 percent in the last few years not a big drop but it is starting to erode while OTT is is going up traditional TV viewership is falling it still immense somehow on average we still managed to watch four hours of television a day but it is coming down if it were just the average and going back to the generational piece wouldn't be so worrisome four hours is plenty but if you look at what's really happening on an a basis with television what you find is that people my age and older who grew up watching television as I said earlier we still watch TV we are the nice little green folks up at the top 50 through 95 we in fact watch more TV than we did five years ago which is what this chart is showing but every other age group especially 18 to 24 the amount of TV they're watching on average is declining every year 18 to 24 is down 40% in the last five years so it is a severe decline and again one of the questions I'll have for james Murdoch and we talked about this in preparation earlier is you know are your kids gonna be watching your product and certainly the early indications is is probably not at least probably not in the form that we are used to meanwhile at the same time what we see are all of the big OTT digital networks growing incredibly rapidly I would argue that these are simply modern TV networks they're what TV networks would be if you were to design them from the ground up today and in fact the linear television concept while very convenient and useful for 60 to 70 years is now archaic and not as as flexible and convenient and that's why this is happening people were a few years ago saying oh yes but they're just so small these little networks who cares about them it's important to now put in perspective that iTunes and Netflix two of the biggest and I would argue that iTunes really is just a modern TV network with a different different consumption habit now to Wharf an average cable network like AMC YouTube again many years of insults thrown at YouTube for the content they have u2 is now bigger than CBS in advertising revenue and still growing incredibly rapidly now getting into subscriptions now getting mobile and social so huge growth they're left where as CBS is shrinking as its audience ages Netflix is watch more hours per month than any other network because they are not constrained by 24 hours of programming they have enough programming to serve our entire household on different screens to watch what we want whenever we want much more convenient and so they are soaking up a huge amount the total viewing time and really when you get to it that is why modern TV networks are winning it's because they're a better product we can watch what we want to watch whenever we want to watch it wherever we want to watch it on any screen it's much more convenient yes you can do that with some of the solutions the traditional networks have come up with but there's a lot more friction involved and as we'll talk about at the end turns out that even having a play button is a is an amount of friction that some have removed and that increases viewing a lot more so the slightest bit of friction matters and and ultimately these networks are just much more convenient so what's gonna happen to television first thing is TV will not die so please ignore all predictions that say that they are exaggerated old media don't die basically what happens is they get niche if I'd if you look at what's happened to print and radio they're still very vibrant they're not growing anymore but they've found niches they will be around for a long time second important point about television is that there are three parts to television and two of them are thriving and will continue to thrive the first is that modern TV networks are gonna continue to thrive Netflix iTunes and so forth we are consuming as I suggested earlier way more great programming than we ever have before we're just doing it in different ways so the modern networks will be in great shape second access providers are in great shape every year goes by we need more bits ultimately the pipe companies are very concerned about just being in the bit delivery business this is one of the big impetus is for AT&T buying Time Warner they don't just want to be a pipe but turns out we need more pipe and it's incredible business delivering all this stuff to us so access providers are in great shape even if they don't charge for linear television the way they used to where the pain will be is in traditional TV networks and I think they will now go through decades of consolidation and pain sounds like bad news good news is it's going to take decades it will be little by little I was speaking with a source familiar with bud speeds thinking recently and I asked the sources you know why I raised another 250 mm in dollars you already raised 250 what happened and the source said well you know I read the history and I watched the I read that paramount was the greatest movie studio in the history of the world back in the heyday of the movie studios then the recession came along and they went bankrupt because they had all this high fixed cost then when we came out they were the number one again you know it's gonna take a long time it was 12 years ago that everybody predicted newspapers were screwed here we are 12 years later New York Times print still coming out every day doing fine so these things take a long time to play out so TVs gonna be a great business for a long time but it has likely passed its peak in terms of networks and it's not just that modern TV networks are better we have also hit this point where we only watch 18 channels a month in TV households and we've steadily increased the number of channels that we have and now finally that's starting to roll over where there's just the demand does not support all the networks then second there aren't enough shows that are great to watch all it did support all networks it's actually very hard to make a great television show and series what you look at is that every year more and more start and then the percentage that get continued to the next year drop because again just incredibly hard to make compelling television and then even sports which has been the thing that everybody has clung to and said okay this is gonna save TV forever even sports is now starting to decline and what another question for James Murdoch this morning is what's going on with the NFL I think an interesting answer there will come but as I suggested good news for television is it a rich business it will be many many many many years before they get to actual things that hurt to cut there's a lot left to go so the TV networks will suffer in style so let's go to the next big thing and I'll leave you with that so so talk about this so the first thing is we've talked about a lot of possible next big things in media over the last few years smart watches smart glasses there was an argument that cars were gonna be this great media platform we now have gone through some experiments and we know some things highly unlikely it seems that smart watches or smart glasses or next big media platform smartwatches we have learned through experience now what people like about them and what they're using them for is mainly fitness and it turns out they're good for telling the time that is one thing that a lot of Apple watch devotees will say it's great but lots of frustration it doesn't do what I thought it would do it's expensive and so forth and I think the conclusion ultimately is unless there's some way to project it into your brain we don't actually want a tiny screen for media consumption same with the glasses snapchat it's a big improvement over Google's effort here but that is media construction not not actual consumption so probably not that the other big one that everybody's talking about now is is virtual reality and augmented reality I would say there is definitely promising have consumed media in VR and AR it's cool it may turn out to just be 3d TV which is exciting to do once but not really that necessary I remember watching a movie in VR and thinking or not VR but 360 which is a little bit different than that thank you you know it's kind of cool we're flying along on the drone and you can look down and that's kind of cool and you can look behind you and see the people there and you know what it turns out is that when you're telling a story usually the most interesting stuff is in front of you so when you are watching the really cool thing and then you turn around you see the people behind you also watching the really cool thing it's like okay that was cool once but I'm getting a headache and I would not pay an extra ten dollars for this experience I'm happy to have it on that so I would say that it with the exception of gaming which is obviously incredibly powerful and training and some of these other things VR for storytelling is generally overrated but the real problem is we just don't have a big enough installed base of folks who are willing to slap on the goggles it will not be until we hit 30 million households something like that before it becomes a real mass market and that'll be in a few years so what is the next big thing next big thing is social video if you look at what's happening on Facebook snapchat Twitter many other platforms YouTube although YouTube has been less social which is why it is growing more slowly than than some of the other platforms in terms of views getting more social which is really going in this is a new kind of story and a new kind of distribution and it is a massive opportunity both for storytellers and media consumers and marketers we learned through our own experiments we started this about a year and a half ago and we've had the platform we had this great web video business and we thought oh that's great you know we spent several years figuring out web video and we started with bad CNBC and it was terrible and we finally learned we have to do something different on the web and we figured it out it was growing was very vibrant tens of millions of views and month we were so excited about that so Facebook opened up video we said oh it's great we know how to do this upload them and they'll go bananas on Facebook and so we put our videos on Facebook and they completely flopped and we said what's going wrong here and we actually experienced them in the feed and what you see is talking head comes on and this and it's silent and why would you listen next and you scroll on and so what we realize there are a lot of experimentation is that these stories are fundamentally different even than web video and a few things to note on that you have about a second to stop somebody scrolling through their feed and it has to be an arresting image very tough for video producers who are used to having at least a few seconds maybe even 30 seconds to a minute on TV but mmm that's all you get it's got to be good you got to understand the story without sound maybe the sound will help but you you have to get it without that and you be induced to turn on the sound it's very intimate and conversational other differences and ultimately it's very shareable as well so you learn all this you begin to figure it out and how to tell compelling stories then good things begin to happen because these stories can travel across many social networks not just Facebook and ultimately the opportunity is massive because the amount of time spent on these networks especially under young with young generations is extraordinary so we've been doing this about a year and a half now or as I said up to about 2.5 billion views a month you say oh yeah a lot of those are Facebook views they're their three-second views it's true but even with 30 second views it's still an incredibly large number so this is a very compelling new format any other good news for storytellers and marketers is turns out you can do a lot with 30 to 60 seconds so let me give you some examples of that so anybody like wine I drink a little bit of wine I do not need a wine cellar for the two to three bottles in my house but peeps Pandi are CRO is actually the wine critic for food 52 and is described his wine cellars and storage equipment to me but there is a new wine cellar that we can all get for a mere fifty five thousand this crew will come to our house and here is a video that will show it so very basic you're flipping through your Facebook there it is very easy to share tens of millions of views later this is cool we're onto something and another example my kids are totally into food they love our food videos that we're doing we sent someone to the Minnesota State Fair you notice in the last one the techniques is speeding everything up that that works very well here's another one that is more of a food shareable so the question that we get from clients and and markers when you talk to this is great it's fine cool viral video you know everyone likes that but can you actually does this actually do anything to people see these videos and and do they work accidentally by producing videos like this we discovered that in fact they do work quite well and the first example of that was we had a video that we did about a bakery in Queens that makes a rainbow bagel was very very popular very widespread and next thing we know we hear from the store they're sending out these pictures saying oh my goodness we've been swamped the demand is so much we have to close for renovations here's another one we just found this cool thing we're at a in a sugar plantation in Hawaii they've turned it into this tubing paradise we thought it looked very cool and then we made it up made up a video and posted it did very well we hadn't talked to the company suddenly somebody called Business Insider's switchboard and said you don't make it like I don't know who to talk to but like whatever you guys did keep doing it because reservations are booked for six months and so forth and I have to say it does look pretty cool I'll give you one more and I should warn you in advance I showed this to a small group the other day and there was an arachnophobia freaked out so if anybody is scared of spiders take a look down so this is a product that we found that looked very cool it's called a spider catcher we weren't in trying to sell any of it we just thought it made a nice little story for those who like spiders and don't want to kill them when they remove them from their houses so we can't found this cool product and we made a story about it and we posted it and lo and behold suddenly sales skyrocketed on Amazon so so very successful so these the answer is these do in fact change behavior and we're now starting to work with Facebook to get a real sense of ultimately on a grand scale what they do so that's the next big thing but I will leave you with one more and that is if you read the papers every day or papers the digital everyday you learned that there's this big trend happening which is we are losing manufacturing jobs to robots and and so forth it's a terrible thing in many ways although the economy will adapt so we're constructing these incredible robots but there is this personality who's become a star on YouTube now who actually makes her living designing bad robots robots that suck at the job they are designed to do so we will end with her and again thank you so much for coming it's great to help all of you and I hope today is very productive I've been building robots for two years now and I think what I really like about them is just that they're very easy to control that makes me sound like a terrible person the reason I started building robots was because I actually wanted to automate some parts of my life but then I kind of realized that the over-the-top solutions were way more fun to build than the actually useful solution so I just kind of went with that a lot of people think that I'm an engineer but I'm actually not and that's actually one of the things that I really want to tell people that you don't need to be an engineer to be an inventor my favorite projects that I've ever built is probably my latest wine which is an applause machine it just always makes you feel so appreciated all right thanks everybody have a great day
