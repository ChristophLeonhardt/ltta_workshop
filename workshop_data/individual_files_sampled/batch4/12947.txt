easy and so we were exchanging writer stories in the makeup room while just was painting this faceless is not my real face just paid so that's based on everyday I actually look much much better than stuff I look more intelligent than this but anyway Jacob and I were talking about you know we're trading writer stories I was telling him this story that happened to me when I was really just starting out I was writing a series of mysteries under a pseudonym that John Wells mysteries which are actually pretty good though one got nominated for an Edgar won one and Edgar they were they were really quite decent but the second one which was lame my sophomore effort and like all sophomore efforts it was kind of a weakest link it was called their fellow shadow and it wasn't that good and but it had this great conclusion the great conclusion was a gunfight in a train station where the bad guys were coming down the stairs and the good guys were coming up to say I can't remember who was on the stairs and there was a baby carriage coming down the stairs falling down the stairs and finally the sky we had set up was a dead shot he took out the guy was holding a hostage shot him in the head from a distance right I'm writing this thing I think at I am one of the great thriller writers ever which turned out to be absolutely true of course but but I but I think about I was really feeling good and I put the last period on it's where the story is true I swear it's true the movie The Untouchables opened and I went to the untouchables and it's a really good movie David Mamet wrote it and Brian DePalma directed it it's really good and I'm watching it and it gets to the end and I'm really you know how you're up here really in the movie and it gets to the climax and it's a shootout so help me it's a shootout on the stairs of a train station with a baby carriage going down the steps and at the end the guy takes the Sharpshooter it takes the guy out and it was like I couldn't believe it was the exact same scene of almost every little thing and it was exactly the same and you know I took out little details to disconnect it but at that point the book was written I think I think it was already at the publishers there was nothing I could do about it so I always hated its trickle but recently I went back and watched it again and it's actually very good I never was a big Brian DePalma fan but I loved David Mann and I went back and watched it again and it really occurred to me that it speaks directly into the situation we are in right now it has it's it's got Kevin Costner stars as Eliot Ness and he comes to Chicago to clean up Chicago which is being run by the gangster Al Capone played by Robert De Niro and the whole thing about Kevin Costner is he's a boy scout you know Eliot Ness is a boy scout he doesn't he never does anything wrong he never breaks the law and basically he meets the tough cop Sean Connery and Sean Connery says if you go around being a nice guy and playing by the rules and playing by the rule of law Al Capone is going to destroy you because he doesn't care how clear your family he'll kill everybody and they have what has become this famous exchange where Sean Connery explains to the boy scout Kevin Costner what he's going to do you said you wanted to know how to get Kapoor do you really want to go you see where I'm saying what are you prepared to go home everything within the law and then what are you prepared to do if you open the ball on these people mr. NESH you must be prepared to go all the way because they won't give up the fight until one of you is dead I want to get Capone I don't know man I can only get Capone Tigers how do you get he pulls a knife you pull the gun he sends one of us to the hospital you send one a haste of a log so that became obviously this famous thing and remember I think was obama saying if they punch you punch back twice as hard and people use this tough-guy language in politics but it is the question that we're facing when we have this stuff this day after day drumbeat of Donald Trump and Russians and the Russians are coming the Russians are coming where are we supposed to stand where are we supposed to say oh yes he did the wrong thing or this is you know I like I said I don't believe this is a nothing burger I believe it's a stupid burger I believe this whole story is utterly ridiculous and the Donald Trump jr. probably pulled a Fredo and just didn't know what he was doing and you know there's these guys have a lot of contact with the Russians it's Donald Trump with a lot of business with Russian so he's going to be in contact with them and they're probably and every businessman in Russia has contacts in the Kremlin because that's all it's a single you know the government runs everything there so when are we supposed to get excited about this and of course we have the guys at national review and they have been they are the right wing voice of the never Trump errs now they keep saying well there's no such thing as never Trump because Trump is now in office but still they have taken the attitude that this is disgraceful this is like a terrible terrible thing you know and anybody who says it's not has sold out and of course this is one of the things about these arguments of course your side you always feel that you are being utterly rational and living by these virtuous rules but the other guy is acting out of psychology and he's selling himself out that's always the way it works you know like I I just have principles and I'm sticking to my principles and it's all very rational you on the other hand are willing to throw everything away in your passion and psychology and it's always the other guy is being irrational so my pal John Nolte who I love to death he wrote a piece for The Daily wire where he basically just said I am all-in with this and he said it's so easy just and by the way we're still working on technology so we cancelled today we're going to have Roger Kimball we've moved him up into next week we don't wanna bring on a guest so we can't have but Nolte will come on and he will get a chance to strike back so I'm not talking behind his back here but he wrote he says it's so easy to sit in your ivory tower and join the howling mob of moral narcissists on the left and right those who preen and pose their own virtue through feigned outrage Don junior should have gone to the FBI they Huff Americans don't do this they puff this is morally wrong they're wrong please in this toxic political climate created solely by a thoroughly corrupted mainstream media those of us who believe in individual liberty religious freedom killing terrorists ending the tyranny of the bureaucracy the sanctity of life the rule of law and that Western civilization rules have been given only two choices we can either do whatever it takes to win elections or we can get ourselves destroyed that's it in the real world and that's where I live those are our only options and so the question is that where the real question is are we in that situation are we battling Capone you know is it this bad and in the thing I I have to say on the never Trump I hit Nolte before because he endorsed the shutting down of the anti Donald Trump Shakespeare in the Park Julius Caesar where they assassinated Donald Trump a bunch of activists got up and shut it down a couple of actives got up and shut it down and Nolte said this is great this is a good thing I said no it's not no it's not it's not it's not because they're being tough it's not because they're you know out there trying to win it's because they're trying to win the wrong thing if you're in a town where the Corleone family is fighting the soprano family that doesn't matter who wins it doesn't matter who wins one side has to be Kevin Costner one side has to be fighting for the rule of law and then you can see where you break some of the rules to get back to the rule of all everybody forgets everybody quotes The Untouchables especially that scene but they forget the last line of the Untouchables as the Eliot Ness is walking out of the building somebody says to them what are you going to do when they repeal prohibition he says I'm going to take a drink and the point is that this guy stands for the rule of law even when he disagrees and so the situation that we're dealing with is trying to figure out how bad is this because there is a mistake that I feel the anti-trump right makes and I will talk about it in a minute but first yesterday though this was hilarious yes yesterday I talked to the people from me undies and they they said to me I don't know if you've ever seen me on these there are ads all over LA so we all know all about it but you go on their website me on these comm and they're selling underwear and nice shirts and vests and sweaters and things like this for men and women and the thing is it is supposed to be they today told me this is the softest underwear you will ever wear now I've ordered my pair but I haven't worn it yet so I can't personally enjoy it but but she was telling me the lady from me on these was telling me this is the softest underwear you will ever wear and of course it comes it's not just black or white it comes in all these incredible designs you can match it with your wife or your significant other you can both have the same color obviously not the same underwear but the same color underwear and you

really very cool and lots of fun and she say to me this is the softest it's made with something called micro modown who sounds like the latest actor doesn't it Bob Mike Modell but apparently this stuff is softer than cotton it's apparently so soft you put this stuff on and it's incredible so I'm listening to this whole thing and obviously a really nice lady and also at the end of it I said they say you have any questions I said yeah why is it me undies why why isn't it my undies you know I mean what is I don't understand what's gained by saying me undies which is you know instead of my own absolute silence nobody knows nobody knows wipes me undies comes with a Miami so hang-up Julia Whittle who is one of our wonderful people we're here works you know part of this getting the advertising then she said well maybe it was invented by pirates I thought well that's obviously it right I mean somewhere it's in the eighteen hundreds our captain you're looking mighty comfortable

Julia Whittle and you know Julia Whittle is actually people always ask are you related to Bill Whittle my pal and a great commentator and the fact is she is related to him but if you look at Julia little Julia Whittle is a absolutely beautiful young woman and one of the nicest people here so if you must be a very very distant relation I mean I'm thinking like the seventy second cousin five times removed or something like this because she you couldn't look like that be closely well you know I saw bill yesterday I was on his show on the ease on in or a TV yesterday and I said to him you know the NRA is like I support the NRA their staunch I support them emotionally you know there's staunch defenders of the Second Amendment right to bear arms I said to them but they must have a a widdle exception right they must understand the bill is the one and only person in this country who should no way be let anywhere near a lethal weapon because he's just a dangerous dangerous man let me tell you where I think the anti-trump right goes wrong some of them will say they will say to you in order to justify you're looking the other way I don't feel by the way I do look the other way on Donald Trump I just feel that I don't get excited the left does this all the time and it is a coordinated effort by the deep state meaning the administrative state the mainstream media and the Democrat Party they are all acting in tandem to try and destroy this presidency with leaks and by you know sending out information and by only reporting I mean that was the joke of the opening they're only reporting one side of this this woman that Donald Trump jr. is supposed to Memphis Russian woman was allowed into the country by the Obama administration she was given a special visa she's been barred from the country and Obama administration gave her a special visa is a very strange story you know this story is very strange I really do feel that Donald Trump jr. may have been set up in some way I can't obviously I don't have any information about that but it just looks like that tonight but the one thing I disagree with the anti-trump right is they keep saying that we who have come to support Trump and it with me has been very reluctant very slow they keep saying that we keep making Hillary Clinton worse and worse to justify Trump's I'm sorry but I think it's the exact opposite I think they have forgotten how bad it was there is a great and how bad it was and how bad these people are I really do I really think that they have forgotten how panicked they were how desperate we were how much we thought what a disaster we thought this was going to be and and it would have been had anybody else but Donald Trump run and my evidence for that is the fact that Donald Trump swept the competition away like it was dust I mean these were impressive important people Ted Cruz is an impressive guy I mean Jeb Bush had all that money behind him Marco Rubio a young up-and-comer Trump swept them all away and that tells you I think that they would not have won even if you think that Hillary Clinton lost the election there's a lot of evidence for that I do not think she would have lost it to anybody else evidenced by the fact that Trump swept them all away damn Henninger wrote a column in The Wall Street Journal today one of his best columns I always laugh at then hang-ten eager because he is the avatar of the establishment you know there is nothing radical about him there's nothing like you know he's mainstream he looks like the establishment came to light he looks like if if like you like in Pinocchio you said I'm going to turn the establishment into a real boy it would be beniker okay those columns are usually pretty down the middle not you know very radical or anything like this but he will today he said the Trump he's talking about what I've been talking about all week the fact that Trump gave a speech in defense of Western civilization and the left's at O Western civilization that's no good that's racist left just to Western civilization that's that's a code word for white nationalism for white supremacy here's what henagar says in part I'm gonna read a substantial piece of this because it really is good he says the Trump base knew that the 2016 presidential election the contest between mr. Obama's successor and whoever would run against her wasn't just another election it was a crucial event deciding whether America would go on in the Western tradition as it had developed in the US or continue its steady drift away from those ideals as it had in the eight years under Obama I completely agree with this I do with this I do believe that the election of Hillary Clinton would have meant the end of the American experiment I so he goes Hennig her goes on if there is one controlling Western idea developed across centuries in Europe including by resort to war it is that the individual person deserves formalized protection from the weight of arbitrary political authority whether Kings clergy or dictators the founders were obsessed with this idea they designed a government explicitly to protect smaller units individuals local governments from being overwhelmed by too powerful political authority the American Left has never been all together with all together comfortable with the u.s. is decentralized difficult political system once it identifies a universal political good it is impatient to put it in place one of the first American ideas resisted by the left was federalism the states they believe can't be trusted to do the right thing now here's the important part he's talking about the founding of this country and what the founders were obsessed with and he talks about Thomas Jefferson's there's a word for it but it was his chart his list of charges his indictment of King George and all the bad things that King George had done I won't run through them all right now but just keep those in mind Henninger says in the 50s and 60s the attack on federalism had to do with remedies for racial discrimination with mr. Obama the Federalists disdain accelerated his invite and here is the list of his indictment of hemming Gers indictment of barack obama and his administration his Environmental Protection Agency imposed regulations on behalf of Universalist climate claims the Eric Holder Justice Department filed lawsuits alleging racial disparities against Police Department's towns and local school systems the Obama Labor Department did the same to coerce private employers the Secretary of the Labor Department Tom Perez now leads the Democrat National Committee no more settled part of the West's tradition exists then due process of law and the presumption of innocence which are embedded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights believing that this Western tradition impeded sexual abuse allegations at colleges the Obama Education Department issued guidance that reversed due process and legitimize the presumption of guilt they basically told colleges they were going to lose money if they didn't presume that young men were guilty anytime they were accused of rape that they basically took due process away from any boy in a college who got accused of any kind of sexual malfeasance and you know with the rampant crazed feminism on campus that happens a lot eventually Donald Trump's base somehow intuited that a permanent reformulations of the political traditions of the West was happening here one way to understand American politics today is to think of our divisions as resident of the decade before the Revolutionary War when rebellions trigger was King George and his Parliament in London in our time the struggle is about an aggressive elevation of central authority over the smaller units of American life the progressive Democrats are the new King George ruling 50 post-colonial states from distant Washington Donald Trump's base objects I don't think that's overstating I do not think that's overstating it I think the traditions of the West they this tradition of individual freedom whether you think the main unit of power should be the individual or the family which is a big argument the people on the right have if that tradition was eroding completely and they do not believe on it that left does not believe it you think you're you know you think it's exaggerating to say this stuff but you only have to look at what they say themselves you know the fact that Donald Trump defended Western civilization and they said no I mean this is I keep bringing this up because it's the context of all these summers you know crazy summer stories about Donald Trump jr. whatever having a meeting where nothing happened you know that's the context the context is the other side doesn't like Western civilization let me give you a BC news right reported on a speech the Jeff Sessions gave all right listen to this Attorney General Jeff Sessions delivered a speech to an alleged group had an event closed to reporters on Tuesday night and the Department of Justice is refusing to reveal what he said that's that's the opening okay what who was he talking to the Ku Klux Klan was he talking to the Nazis was he talking to Spencer and the Albright sessions addressed members of the Alliance defending freedom okay this is a religious organization that defends people's religious rights including the right of a baker not to bake a cake for a gay wedding if that is against his religion that makes them designated an anti LGBT hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center which is a hate group it is a hate group that uses its list of hate groups to identify people us on the right and call them hate groups and then ABC reports on this in other words the kind of beliefs that people who believe in Christianity and Judaism have believed for thousands of years and the people in the Muslim world you believe in even harsher and nastier terms these beliefs cause us to be a hate group and Jeff Sessions is somehow mysteriously you know doing something evil by talking to them you want to see the comical version of this Erin Burnett on CNN this is unbelievable there's a picture of Donald Trump in I believe in the Oval Office with lawmakers including Mike Pence surrounding them and they're praying and if you've ever gone to church and if you haven't you should they have their hands on him they're touching them you know and they they're all together praying for the President of the United States a good thing here is CNN anchor Erin Burnett reacting to this picture something we don't see every day here in the image coming out of Donald Trump praying in the Oval Office and all of those hands on him and next a pretty stunning image I mean just give you a quick peek of it the president bowing his head in prayer in the Oval Office and and all these people sort of touching him it's very strange we're going to tell you what happened there what's going you know this reminds me when george w bush was president he made a speech and he said he talked about the good samaritan and so help me i can't remember i think was in the new york times somebody said that is code language for the religious right I thought the Good Samaritan is code language for the religious right I mean that's how to catch these people are from the traditions that make everything they fight for is underlined Lane by those traditions everything they fight for stands on those traditions that they want to destroy but the thing is they're not fighting for those things anymore they everything they do turns out to be the opposite of what they say they want the feminists say they want strong women look at feminists they do nothing but complain they do nothing but attack one another and we remember when it was when feminism meant that women should not attack one another did you see own walls now that you can't believe this though did you see Joan Walsh she is an MSNBC commentator and she was talking about the fact that a vodka Trump for a few minutes sat in we're with Donald Trump at the g20 right and why this was a big deal i I don't know because this happens all the time that the leader walks away and somebody says and I guess because the daughter some people thought it looked some royal or something like this and and this is a big problem MSNBC's Jim wolf this is her comment on that it's about her dress yes we have her father at the g20 right which she bows on her sleeve I mean I I don't mean to sound sexist it can be dangerous to comment on what women wear but the fact that she sat in for her father and a dress that was so incredibly ornamental was such a contradiction in terms and I think that what we see is that in patriarchal authoritarian societies daughters have great value they are property and the message that she is sending about her own value about her place in the White House and about the place of women in this administration I think are really pretty frightening some feet you're opening yourself up about the boat are you looking at Twitter yet I met you know that was a very the pink dress with big big bows on the elbows there's something incredibly ornamental that's not a dress that's made for work that's not a dress it's me to go out in the world and make a difference that is a dress that is designed to show off you're growing us and you know god bless her show it off but don't then tell us that you're crusading for an equal place for women at the table because you're not what if you are what if you're doing that and you're wearing a pink you we have a picture of the pink dress can you show hey she looks lovely I mean it's a it's a obviously a very beautiful woman and it looks very nice but what if you are crusading for equal rights for women wearing a pink dress with bows on then what happens I mean you know what you probably get more of what you're looking for then if you watch showed up in a paper sack you know I may be a paper sack would be alright but I mean you know if you showed up looking like I'm in one of Hillary Clinton's pants suits maybe you don't get as much so maybe she's using what she's got yeah it's just insane them they become who they oppose they always become who they oppose and the way they do become that way is they adopt they accept the values of the people they oppose because they think those values are victorious so in other words they say well men have oppressed women and therefore we accept men's values but we can be just as good at being men as men are and of course you can't be just as good as men and that being a man as a man is any more than I can be as good at being a woman as a woman is that doesn't make any sense whatsoever but all it does is turns when you adopt people's values when you adopt somebody's values you get to their goals now you had her that was the most sexy I mean I gotta be honest I feel like I am a sexist in the sense that I believe men and women are very different if that makes me a sexist I'm a sexist I would never say something like that I would never say something like that a woman in a pink dress telling explain to me what she wants out of government I you know what I would not be thinking is hmm pink dress I would do thinking what is she saying what is she talking about does she have a point you know that's what I would be thinking about they become exam what they behold happens to the blacks the blacks say you know well the white man oppressed us so we're going to oppress him back we're going to he press us for being blacks we're going to press him for being white so what happens you know you go to college and you have a dorm it's for black people you have segregation the left does that the left becomes would it be hold and that is why that's why I am cautious in saying the Sean Connery line yes if they come with a knife you know come with a gun if they put one of ours in the hospital put them in the more fight back twice as hard no question about it but me sure you're fighting for what you want to win right make sure you are not fighting for the same gangster values that they bring to us we have to fight for our values and look Trump is a flawed guy he is a flawed guy I'm not so I can't understand that you know I know Austin is also perfect ingested you know we're a roomful of perfect people but Trump is a flawed guy and he's probably I will say this the law has been after this guy for 30 years and they've never indicted him on anything so I kind of assume that he may may play a little bit color outside the lines a little bit but I kind of assumed that he's never you know really done anything terrible or they would have gotten him they've been after him for a long time but he is a flawed guy he has a temper he gets petty he has these feuds but so far he's fighting the right fight he's fighting the fight for Western civilization and if he is a fraud spokesman for it at least he's a spokesman against the spew and he makes a good point he was talking to Pat Robertson the other day and he was talking about Russia and he makes the point that after all this smoke is cleared this Donald Trump jr. nothing smoke is cleared who is it who is it who is a more dangerous adversary to Vladimir Putin let's hear if Hillary had won our military would be decimated our energy would be much more expensive that's what Putin doesn't like about me and that's why I say why would he want me because from day one I wanted a strong military he doesn't want to see that and from day one I want fracking and everything else would get energy prices low and to create tremendous energy we're going to be self-supporting we just about are now we're going to be exporting energy he doesn't want that he would like Hillary was she wants to have windmills you know if you would much rather have that because energy prices will go up and Russia as you know relies very much on energy get us wrong there are many things that I do that are the exact opposite of what he would want so when I keep hearing about that he would have rather had Trump I think probably not because when I want a strong military you know she wouldn't have spent the money on the military but when I want a strong military when I want tremendous energy we're opening up coal we're opening up natural gas we're opening up tracking all the things that he would hate but nobody ever mentioned said anti-trump right doesn't see is the trump is change Trump is actually developed you know he does still sink back into these petty feuds that I wish sometimes he would let them pass but the guy is talking now has now got a sense of the problems that he's facing what he always pictures himself as is a problem solver he wants you to love him for solving your problems and now he's got a sense of how he can operate and the scope of his operation and I just really wish the Congress would step up because this is a moment we're not going to get a perfect repeal of Obamacare I just do not believe there is a path to that given the numbers and the people involved but I do think I really do think that if they passed something you know what Ted Cruz is trying to do is trying to get a repeal in there they've just released the new version of the health care thing I haven't had time to look at it so I'm not going to talk about specifically but apparently Ted Cruz's amendment is in there that would allow insurance companies if they offer an Obamacare package they can also offer anything else they want and I think what Cruz and a couple of other people are trying to do is engineer a bill that will slowly kill Obamacare even if it doesn't repeal it right now and I think that guys like Rand Paul I think they ought to get on board I think they ought to give Trump I said this the first time that in the house I think that I give Trump the legislative victory he needs set him up you know keep keep working on the bill make it better and better but still I think they should let him go forward Trump says let's listen to one last cut of Trump number three he says it'll be he'll be ticked off if they don't do it but with all of that being said has to get passed they have to do it they have to get together and get it done well that but they don't well I don't want to talk about it because I think would be very bad I will be very angry about it and a lot of people will be very upset but I'm sitting waiting for that bill to come to my desk I hope that they do it they've been promising it for years they've been promising it ever since Obamacare which is failed it's a failed experiment it is totally it's out of business and we have to get this done repeal and replace you know I think they should do it for them and I think we should stop you know clutching our pearls at every bombshell revelation that disappears you know I until I see evidence that Donald Trump was taking money from Vladimir Putin to turn our country over to Russia I am willing to stand up for a guy who is standing up for Western civilization against these people who are not it is Chicago they are Capone we have to stop them and if it means playing a little rough sometimes I'm not willing to go as far as Nolte in fighting for things that I don't believe in for doing things that I don't believe in but I will fight very hard for the things that I believe in and I'm not going to pick on Trump every time they come up with another pearl clutching exciting story as I know is going to blow away with the wind just before we enter the bleak bleak bleak nosov the bleak clayvin this weekend I do want to say that today's my birthday oh thank you very much I respect Bridget I'm 115 years old I look great practice hoods that's right after this just gives me a you know wipe and I take it off and I am Pat Robertson I just want to say what a pleasure I'm what a great time I'm having I am really having one of the times of my life I've had a couple of really great periods of my life this is one of them I love being at the Daily wire I love that except for the people in this room accepted it would really look at them hi James Shapiro and Jeremy boring all these people they they are if you love them you're right they are some of the great people it's just been bliss you know I have to say this we we do talk about Christianity here a lot and I talk about my faith and why maybe because I came to faith so late in life I see it differently than a lot of people do a lot of people look at the Gospels look at Christianity as some kind of rulebook for doing the right thing you know you're going to do this and then you'll be a good person and then you'll get a reward and I don't see it like that at all to be honest with you I see it as a handbook for bliss I see its input for being as happy as you can possibly be I really do I mean that I mean I read the Gospels every day I read them in Greek he bragged but and I you know so I really study them and what I see is a guidebook on how to be happy how to be happy and light and there used to be there still a disease he's got he's gone but his books remain I was very into Joseph Campbell when I was a kid and I would read his books he was a great student of mythology he wrote a wonderful book that if that you would really enjoy called hero with a thousand faces about how many many myths are really the same myth the monomyth as James Joyce called it and and Joseph Campbell became very famous right toward the end of his life nobody knew who he was in fact I was writing articles about him and trying to sell them and I remember writing for one newspaper and they said we don't know who this is we don't want an article about Joseph Campbell and that he died and after he died he suddenly became very famous because of this interviews with Bill Moyer on PBS and they called me up and they say she still have that article I sold them this big article about and he was conservative they hate to remember this because he's now airy-fairy kind of left loves him but he was he was actually conservative and he in this final interview that he gave he said follow your bliss that is his advice at the end of his life follow your bliss and I would amend that a little bit he was he was criticized for being selfish that's a selfish thing to I would amend that just a little bit I would just say that all bliss comes from love and the more the more valuable the thing you love the more bliss you get out of it and one of the things that I look back because when you get to my age the bill comes to the bill for the way you behave comes to if you have three wives and your kids hate you this is when it comes to you know and I really feel fortunate of where I am in life and it is because the one thing I did even when I was crazy even when I was really messed up is I followed love I followed I married the woman I loved I had children I and I loved them and I do the work that I love every day and I you know it's cost me some dough to do the work that I love but I do the work I love and you get bliss from it and I said the more valuable something is the more bliss you get out of it so I love cryptic puzzles and I love the NFL I get a little bliss out of that I love a lot of people there are a lot of people in my life who I love I get a lot of bliss out of that you love God you get all the bliss in the world it really is a good time it's a good time and if I walk out of here and get hit by a car the only reason I say that is because Shapiro has a car idling outside and every time I open the door but the car know that I went out celebrating all right before the clayvin this weekend begins stuff I like have been hitting baby driver all this time because it's such a big success and that we got such great reviews and I didn't really like it all that much I like the first 45 minutes a lot and then I felt it went off the rails but it did one thing is reintroduced this song that I've always really liked by Simon & Garfunkel called baby driver we will end with that this is the Andrew Clavin show I'm Andrew Clavin the Clavin this weekend begins survivors gather here on Monday hit
