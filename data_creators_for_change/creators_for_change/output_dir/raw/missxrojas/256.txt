walking<font color="#CCCCCC"> around carrying one of these and</font>

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,770

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,020
simply the books on my bad campaign is

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,850
publishers and booksellers coming

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,230
together to promote shopping in

11
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,230
bookshops but rosianna you ask why<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,000
they doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with one book shop</font>

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,460
closing every week and a third of all

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,349
book shops closing in the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

15
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,289

21
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,800
serious loss for the community so yeah I

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,059
