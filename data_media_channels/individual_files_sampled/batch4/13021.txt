weekend was of course the White House Correspondents Dinner I hate the White House Correspondents Dinner I think it's stupid I think that it is self-aggrandizing every year I complain about it there's been four probably 10 years running I say that it's just ridiculous to have all of these journalists sitting there in tuxes feeding each other and talking about how wonderful they are and then patting each other on the back and have this roast there's one event every year that is made to order to make Americans feel as though they are out of the loop and scorned by the media elite it is the White House Correspondents Dinner we were actually invited to a White House Correspondents Dinner I did not go I really am not particularly interested in going it doesn't look like a very fun event to be at honestly it's just a place for for people to hobnob with each other when they talk about Washington DC cocktail parties this is exactly the sort of thing they are talking about well everything was going sort of as planned as per the usual arrangement the White House Correspondents Dinner a bunch of rich people famous people patting each other on the back and talking about wonderful they are and making some sort of light jokes about one another and then Michelle wolf got up now I don't know I'd never heard of this person Michelle wolf and you guys heard of Michelle wolf before this I've never heard of Michelle wolf before this I just figured to choose some sort of Debbie wasserman-schultz impersonator I had no clue who she was and she gets apparently it turns out that she's a writer for Comedy Central which demonstrates presumably why Trevor Noah is deeply unfunny I guess this explains a lot of things that explains Trevor Noah explains Samantha bees prior history I don't know if she wrote for either of those shows but if not then she does a lot of compete reott or just as unfunny as she is so Michelle wolf gets up when she was a 19 minute monologue and we're not gonna play for you this 90-minute monologue because I watched it and it probably took four years off my life just in terms of sheer boredom and I was just watching it and I could feel my hair turning gray I it was like the end of Indiana Jones and and the Holy Grail is like that is like I drunk from the wrong cup by the end of the amount of monologue I'd added several gray hairs and several wrinkles to my forehead but Michelle wolf did this monologue and it's been much ballyhooed people on the left many of them defending it some people on the left not defending it people on the right of course very very upset about I want to talk about this because I want to talk about the value of humor in Trump era America I don't talk about the media's response to all of this as a precursor let it be noted no one made a joke about Obama for eight years at the White House Correspondents Dinner it was forbidden you're allowed to make jokes about Paul Ryan about Mitch McConnell about Mitt Romney about John McCain you're allowed to make jokes about a bunch of foreign leaders you were not allowed to make jokes that were serious about Barack Obama and this is why Seth Meyers and Cru we're making it was great I mean if you're a Republican president you could be attacked when you order the president like bush or you could be attacked when you were not the president like Bush when Obama was president so the White House Correspondents Dinner has always become a roast of the right which of course has justified the right ones hatred of the media one of the great lies the media have put out over the past several years is that President Trump is the one who jinda all of this dislike of the media that's utter nonsense as I said at CPAC we hated you guys before we thought you guys sucked we thought that you were bad at your job we thought that you were not objective and you were pretending to be objective we thought that you were wildly left-wing so it's not a shock really that michelle wolf was up there ripping into president Trump but it was the level of vitriol that she used it was the it was the crazy level of betrayal that she used that that got people really upset particularly her rip I'm Sarah Huckabee Sanders so Trump declines to go but a bunch of members of the White House were there so Kellyanne Conway went I don't know why if you're Kellyanne Conway you would go Sarah Huckabee Sanders went I don't know why if you're Sarah Huckabee Sanders you would go you know you're gonna go there you know you're gonna get roasted and Michele will certainly roasted Sarah Huckabee Sanders again in in quite unfunny fashion and you know there are a lot of folks out there you say that I have an annoying voice folks you have not heard annoying until you've heard this voice oh here's Michelle wolf going off on Sarah Huckabee Sanders I have to say I'm a little star-struck I love you as aunt Lydia and The Handmaid's Tale my pants if you haven't seen it you would love it I actually really like Sarah I think she's very resourceful like she burns facts and then she uses that Ash to create a perfect smoky eye like maybe she's born with it maybe it's lies and I'm never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders you know is it Sarah Sanders is it Sarah Huckabee Sanders is it cousin Huckabee is it auntie Huckabee Sanders like what's Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women Coulter okay so number one it was any of that funny like if you're on the Left you find that funny maybe we just have wildly different senses of humor but I didn't find any of that funny like I will laugh if there's a good anti Trump joke because a good joke is a good joke but that's not a good joke now a lot of people were getting on wolf for supposedly ripping on Huckabee Sanders his looks I'm not hearing her rip on Huckabee Sanders his looks right there actually I didn't actually hear the evidence that she's ripping on Sarah Huckabee Sanders has looked she makes a reference about smoky eye she makes a reference about aunt Lydia from The Handmaid's Tale which I believe is more of a rip on Huckabee Sanders his character I mean this is where we become an American side you're allowed to say that a woman wants other women to be raped for purposes of impregnation which is the which is actually the the role of aunt Lydia in The Handmaid's Tale in The Handmaid's Tale that Lydia his woman who oversees all of the women who are raped forcibly you know forcibly consummated by men and then are forced to bear their children and so that seems to me that would be more of an insult than that she's ugly but that's not but people didn't take it that way you're not allowed to attack Sarah Huckabee Sanders on these grounds because presumably there was some sort of covert joke there about aunt Lydia being played by a not very attractive woman in the series and Sarah Huckabee Sanders looks like that woman again I'm not hearing the the evidence that Sarah Huckabee Sanders was ripped on account of her looks I am hearing a lot of very mean and stupid jokes about Sarah Huckabee Sanders but I'm not sure that it's that much wildly beyond the pale of anything else Michele Wolf said like for example I think her rip on Mike Pence was just as bad as her rip on Sarah Huckabee Sanders here's what she said about my pens a lot of people want Trump to be in I do not because just when you think Trump is awful you remember Mike Bettes my fence is what happens when Anderson Cooper isn't gay my kind of guy that brushes his teeth and then drinks orange juice and thinks mmm I don't even know what that means about the orange juice and the toothbrushing like well does he have no taste buds what exactly is the idea there in any case again making The Handmaid's Tale reference about my pen sheets you'd do that several times throughout the evening and it's just you know again I think bad comedy I don't think this is wildly egregious here's what I do think was wildly egregious so here is the point where she is demonstrative what the left thinks are you can hear the entire crowd laughing at all of this laughing along my pence is just terrible Sarah Huckabee Sanders burns bags ahahahahahaha and everybody in the audience who's laughing understand that you just undermined your credibility for the next ten years with the entire right-wing audience you guys are trying to prove that Trump hates the media because he's disrespectful of the truth well you guys are disrespectful of a very basic truth you are biased you are left-wing you think these jokes are funny you have to be left-wing you think these jokes are funny or brain-damaged those are the only two possibilities because the jokes are not funny number one and number two they're all very much left-wing jokes and it'll be funny because you'll hear at the end Michelle wolf makes a couple of jokes actually lectures and members of the media and they do not take it well but here's the here's the joke that got a laugh from some members of the media that just demonstrates full scale where the media's heads are at the level of bias in the media it's pretty astonishing this is the one that should have shook the room all right this is the joke that people should have enough said about not the stuff about Sarah Huckabee Sanders look I understand we live in the me2 moment and we're supposed to have female solidarity and if there's any sort of implication then we'll miss it is attacking another woman but that's really terrible and all of this here's the joke that I was offended by okay because it turns out I like babies okay I think babies are good here's the joke that I was offended by here's Michelle wolf I'm telling an abortion joke I guess that's what this says and it does demonstrate anything full-scale what folks on the Left think about abortion which is pretty unfortunate my friends is also very anti choice he thinks abortion is murder which first of all don't knock it till you try it and when you do try it really knock it you know you got to get that baby out of it and yeah sure you can groan all you won I know a lot of you are very anti-abortion you know unless it's the one you got for your secret mistress waiver ha ha ha ha and look at the look at the expressions the media they're all the smiles oh the Oh isn't she charming oh so she basically it's a baby it's not murder but it's a baby you should really hit it hard till it comes out of there and I'll say y'all bought abortions to your mistresses so now it's more all huh ha ha ha ha ha ok the disrespect for human life there I think is a lot more deeply troubling from the left and the disrespect for Sarah Huckabee Sanders again so I think Sarah Huckabee Sanders has a right to be mad yeah I mean this wasn't a roast right if he were roast Sarah Huckabee Sanders would get to get up there and respond but Sarah Huckabee Sanders is sitting there and I think solidly taking it and and Kellyanne Conway doing the same thing but that joke is the one that I think is really amazing and again you have to be not only on the left but I think relatively inhuman to think that that is a funny joke I don't knock abortion until you try it and if you do try it really knock it cuz you got to get that baby out of there Wow justjust hilarious hilarious stuff now there was one joke that did fall flat for Michelle wolf among the people in the audience and that was her rip on the media so in just a second I'm gonna play that for you because this actually was the one point in her in her little monologue that I thought was worthwhile and then we'll get to all the reactions to this and the demonstration at the media and all of their quote-unquote unbiased glory or anything anything but unbiased but first I want to say thanks to our sponsor is over at 1-800 flowers so it's hard for you to find a bigger fan of you than your mom well throughout all of your life she's been supporting

again and let's know we sent you 1-800 flowers calm / Schapiro okay so finally Michelle wolf tells a joke that the media don't like so the media like the jokes about Sarah Huckabee Sanders they liked a bunch of jokes about Mike Pence they liked she did a really ridiculous routine where she just talked about how Trump is not all that wealthy which i think is probably true I don't think Trump is as wealthy as he says he is but she actually started telling a series of joke saying Donald Trump isn't as well see who wealthy as he thinks he is he's so poor that and then he should have the audience say how poor is he and then should give a giving a little joke at the end in any case here is the only thing the media did not laugh at her rip at the media which is the only true thing she said the entire night so here's Michelle wolf again at the White House Correspondents Dinner welcome guys it's great to have you you guys love breaking news and you did it you broke it Fox News is here so you know what that means ladies some of your drinks seriously okay but then she went on to rip into the media she suggested that the media had made a bunch of money off of Trump and that they promoted him for their own pocketbook which I think it's certainly true Jeff Zucker has essentially said as much les Moonves at CBS said as much it's not a great shot okay so after all of this happened people started to go nuts oh the White House got very upset and Michelle wolf they said how can Michelle wolf say all of these things so let it be known number one michelle wolf is a comedian she can say any of these things should the White House Correspondents Dinner have had her no it obviously did not fit with the tenor of the actual dinner it did not do what they wanted it to do it did not forward their agenda in any real way in fact it's pretty counterproductive to their agenda so the real blame here I don't think even lies with Michelle wolf who is I will admit I think a really galling piece of work but if the White House Correspondents Dinner that decided to have her so it's on the journalists who organized this thing not on Michelle wolf Michelle wolf was just being Michelle wolf the White House Correspondents Dinner they're the people who invited her well White House officials were slamming Michelle wolf they said that she was incredibly disrespectful again I think she was gross I think she was disrespectful I think that there is something weird about the White House complaining about people being gross in disrespectful and President Trump spent the entire 2016 campaign ripping into every one of his opponents as ugly and stupid but in any case here is that Henry talking about it what happened to Sarah Sanders last night was disgusting and I say that as a former president of the White House Correspondents Association buy the briefing tomorrow I hope that the White House Correspondents Association which I am a card-carrying paid member of still you guys should put out at least a statement an apology to sarah sanders who you work with professionally to go after her physical appearance to say some of the things that it obviously is so far beyond the line that i hope and pray the association apologizes to sarah Sanders so I mean again I'm gonna try and be fair-minded about this I don't think that Sarah Huckabee Sanders his physical appearance was clearly attacked I think that everyone took all of the lines as an attack on her physical appearance but I'm not sure that that's actually what happened I think there a lot of awful things Michele will said that are just as bad and worse about other people but we're gonna talk about the media's response to all of this in just a second because as I say the White House responding by claiming offense I think is a little bit snow flaky but I think that the media's response by the same token is just as snow flaky in a different way so here's here's what I mean so the way that the Left responded to the White House criticizing Michelle wolf was by saying Michelle wolf was some sort of great hero there's a whole article over at vulture calm talking about how Michelle wolf spoke truth to power Michelle wolf did not speak truth to power Michelle wolf just made herself a quick buck Michelle wolf knows Stephen Colbert made his name at the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2005 when he went out of his way to bash President Bush and now the dude has David Letterman's show and so she knows the ten years from now she's gonna be sitting pretty on some late night show because she had this speak truth to power moment so the person who took the least risk in the room actually was Michelle wolf because we're all talking about Michelle wolf on Monday so she did just fine but speaking of hypocrites again I think it's hypocrisy for the White House to complain about people being mean to Trump and his associates you know Trump himself has been quite mean about an enormous number of people he called Ted Cruz's wife ugly in the middle of the campaign he said that megyn kelly was bleeding from her whatever like we don't have to go through the entire campaign again but the thing about President Trump that I think is interesting is that the guy can give it but he can also take it right when Trump gets hit with a lot of these insults he sort of smiles and he takes it well I think the White House should probably do the same here but here's what the media can't see the media demonstrates hypocrisy of its own when they don't condemn Michelle wolf because they say it's terrible what Trump says okay well it's terrible what Trump says you don't get to do it back to him do you right there's no what about ISM here you don't get to say Trump is awful for saying all of these things but Michelle wolf is so brave for saying all of these same sorts of things about members of the Trump administration well Donna Brazile the former head of the DNC that's exactly what she does she defends Michelle wolf and she says well listen it's okay for Michelle wolf to do it cuz obviously Trump says gross things to remember we have no norms now this is a president who has criticized women who have called reporters some disgusting things I don't know if there are any more lines anymore that's that beer that being said look come on this president has said some we're talking about okay Frank the person at times says things and then he says well I'm just joking look I'm not defending her I would use fresh material okay okay but here's the problem is that you are defending her because you're saying Trump is so awful for doing X why don't we do X also I hate this kind of logic when it comes from the right I hate this kind of logic when it comes from the left right now it's coming from the web Kathy Griffin of course who traffics and exactly the sort of nonsense she said the same thing she tweeted out quote I have some thoughts on Michelle Wolf's act in the reaction to it from members of the press and other DC insiders for the record I was in the room last night Michelle wolf set was great she was hilarious and confidence I like how confidence is now like a descriptor for a comedian they like why is it why is it a I don't understand why that's some sort of laudatory thing that you're confident a lot of people are confident the question is where they're good at their job anyway Kathy Griffin continues you know a woman famous for holding up a severed head model of President Trump the calls for the White House Correspondents Association Michelle wolf to apologize are absurd they're coming from reporters and many Trump errs Trump himself has famously never apologized because he thinks it makes him look weak and then she concludes by saying so journalists are willing to demand that a comic hired to roast people apologize but they aren't willing to demand that Trump or his staff apologize to people is that where we're at now can someone explain the difference to me well I mean I can explain the journalists actually did call for Trump to apologize over and over and over he didn't do it so your excuse is that now the left gets to do it as well this is why I don't like what about it as an attack on this sort of thing he's eventually just ends up in the pit eventually everybody's just slapping each other in the mud and then if you say well that's gross they say well yeah but you do it too well the media what's funny about this is the media has finally picked up on the fact that they actually have to be above the fray here and so five years ago they'd probably have been okay with this sort of thing but because Trump has been so harsh on the media because he's gone after them for all of their fake news nonsense even the media was forced to disassociate from show Wolf's routine even the ones who are laughing at it in the room so NBC's Andrew Mitchell she said listen Sarah Huckabee Sanders was grossly insulted and deserves an apology she says apology is owed to press secretary and others grossly insulted New York Michelle wolf at White House Correspondents Association dinner which started with uplifting heartfelt speech by Margaret Talib comedian was worth since Imus insulted Clinton and then Mika Brzezinski did the same thing she also defended Sarah Huckabee Sanders she says watching my wife and mother be humiliated on national television for her looks is deplorable I've experienced insults about my appearance from the president all women have a do to you tonight when these attacks happen and the White House Correspondents Association or Sarah an apology so folks folks on the left are obviously aware of the double standard that they have set up for themselves if they were to green-light what Michelle wolf is doing same thing with president rub so here's my bottom line here Michelle what's a gross person the White House should probably not complain too much about this sort of stuff because President Trump doesn't on a regular basis and the media should not complain about Trump if they're not gonna complain about Michelle wolf okay end of story but the idea that some sort of big national story the only person who makes off like a bandit in this whole situation is the grossest person in the room Michelle wolf and again the grossest thing she said was not about a politician it was about human babies in the womb whom she said ought to be killed anytime you feel like it because some men's mistresses have paid for abortions just yuck okay so in a second I'm gonna show you some

Henry acted badly enough the White House Correspondents Association dinner then there are some pretty great examples of media bias over the weekend that are just astonishing and once again I repeat we hated the media before Trump let's not pretend this is about Trump it is not about Trump Trump rightly sums up the state of the media according to many in the conservative movement their garbage there's home their dumpster fire okay one of the reasons we think their dumpster fire is stuff like there's a joy read over at MSNBC she's a commentator over there enjoy read it came out in the last couple of weeks had a bunch of old post on her blog that were quote-unquote homophobic or Islamophobic you know the ones that I saw maybe there's some other ones I haven't seen seemed relatively mild in any case she'd apologize for them in the past but because joy read is kind of a crazy person joy Reid came out and instead of saying oopsies sorry I did that I've changed my views since then she suggested that instead someone had hacked her web site retro actively to put incriminating posts up about her and then she came out on MSNBC and she finally apologized and here is what her apology sounded like but here's what I know I genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things because they are completely alien to me but I can definitely understand based on things I have tweeted and have written in the past why some people don't believe me I've not been exempt from being dumb or or hurtful to the very people I want to advocate for I own that I get it and for that I am truly truly sorry okay I'm so confused by this what is she sorry for exactly so she says that she doesn't believe that she genuinely does not believe that she said those hateful things it is like when Ted Kennedy after he dumped a woman in a river said that he doesn't understand his actions were a mystery even to himself well what no no no no no no no no no okay so that's not a real apology right when you apologize for something you say what I did was wrong it never should have happened end of story right it never should have happened I made the wrong decision somebody worked for me made the wrong decision I should have done something about it at the time right all of that is acceptable I've had to issue apologies just like that in the past because I've done things that are wrong and I've apologized for them which is what good people do what I didn't say was I genuinely never below him ajik Ferry they came down from the sky like in Pinocchio and wrote that stuff on my blog about how I don't like washing two dudes kiss and Brokeback Mountain which is what she had on her blog okay the entire left said that this is a great apology the entire left said okay done here nothing more to see here we're done we're done now do you recall like a month ago one month ago when Laura Ingraham apologized publicly for making fun of David hog saying that he was whiny about his college admissions do you remember that when the entire left said that's insincere it's an insincere apology Laura Ingraham doesn't mean that she's only saying that because people are coming after her advertisers hey the only reason joy reed said this is because people were coming after her advertisers and because she was going to lose her job hey the reason that she said this is because she got in hot water and even in her apology she doesn't do what Laura did which is I shouldn't have said that instead she says I don't even believe I did it it was just in my crazy mind I don't know how that happened and everybody goes oh well I guess I guess we're done here I mean look at Jerry what a sincere him being there's no media bias though none none at all no media bias speaking of no media bias Oh Tom Brokaw has now been accused of sexual harassment okay so according to the UK Guardian Brokaw was accused by a former colleague of unwanted sexual advances so what happened what happened 60 women in the industry signed a letter trying to defend Tom Brokaw hey Rachel Oh Andrea Mitchell maria shriver their mongol group of 65 women in the US television industry who circulated a letter in support of Tom Brokaw Kelly O'Donnell and Thompson Kristen Welker also put their names to the group letter in which the women say Brokaw 78 has treated all of them with fairness and respect giving them opportunities for advancement and championing successes in their careers broke off the letter says is a man of tremendous decency and integrity the letter was first reported in The Hollywood Reporter and confirmed by the AP hey Brokaw said that wind investor failed in her pursuit of stardom and was given media space to venture grievances Wester said that Brokaw groped her and tried to forcibly kiss her in the 1990s Brokaw wrote that he was angry hurt unmoored from what I thought I would be the final passage of my life and career so here's my question I thought that we were supposed to be leave all women I thought me too I thought female solidarity and yet here are all these female icons Rachel Maddow Andrea Mitchell Maria Shriver signing a letter saying Tom Brokaw is a good guy and we don't believe Linda Wester so um unless you have some evidence to disbelieve Linda Wester why does this help however you mind senior Hall actually try to do this in the early days with a Harvey Weinstein scandal he got a bunch of women who were friendly with Harvey Weinstein to come forward and say well Harvey is actually a good guy right I mean he's actually given me a lot of opportunities you saw the same thing with that there been a bunch of media figures who have done the same thing let's just point out that if Tom Brokaw were a right-wing media figure and that right-wing media figure had a bunch of people signed a letter saying no no this is all nonsense everyone would say wait a second how does maria shriver know what happened to linda Wester how does Andrew Mitchell know what happened to Linda Wester but again Tom Brokaw is gonna get off because a bunch of people on the Left say that it's okay for him to get off speaking of media bias I mean NBC News this is an amazing NBC News hit job so my friend Jordan Peterson who has become something of a phenomenon obviously over the past several months and who's now a best-selling author has been for weeks and weeks and weeks now NBC News on 60 minutes did an absolute hit job on Jordan Peterson the apparent in a 90 minute an interview with Jordan Jordan is not only not all right Jordan has forcibly condemned the all right in no uncertain terms over and over and over so what happened NBC News labeled him and all right intellectual and here's what it looked like it's just an insane thing he takes direct aim at the far left and its effects on young men whom he says have been hurt by a society that over values political correctness and pushes them away from traditional male roles his new self-help book twelve rules for life is already a best-seller hundreds of thousands subscribed to his online lectures his speeches regularly attract protests and his new speaking tour is selling out feels like a movement and I'm excited to be a partner I think he's dangerous because of the sorts of people that he enables journalist John sembly has criticized Peterson is there an ideological similarity between Jordan Peterson and Donald Trump and his followers I would say fundamentally yes they both believe in this basic split of winners and losers of hierarchies of hierarchies being natural Peterson doesn't apologize for his mostly male audience and tells them not to apologize for their privilege describing himself as a kind of father figure get your bloody act together but I'm on your side using psychology religion and biology to justify the same inequality the left opposes what you're saying it just sounds a bit grim doesn't it sure no no no it sounds a lot grim okay that's just that what in the world so I mean we have a full hour interview coming out with Jordan in the very near future okay I speak with Jordan on a regular basis this is the most ridiculous take on Jordan Peterson I've ever seen he's using religion to justify inequality in what world are what are you even talking about what are you even talking about have you read like anything by Jordan Peterson here listen to anything by Jordan Peterson okay what Jordan says is that before you declare that inequality is therefore inequitable you have to determine whether there are natural hierarchies in achievement okay what he says is there are certain people who achieve more in certain people who achieve less the question is whether they violated someone else's rights in achieving more or less and if not then inequality exists but that doesn't mean it's some inequity has happened right which is obviously true but Jordan is apparently an all right intellectual even though he again opposes the outright and then they wonder and then they wonder why we don't trust them and then they wonder why it is that we think that they are completely full of crap in the media because they do ninety minute interviews with Jordan Peterson and then they release 30 seconds of Jordan Peterson talking and 90 seconds of one of his critics talking about how terrible he is and how he's just like Donald Trump Jordan Peterson is just like Donald Trump the dude was an professor of psychology at Harvard University you're right he's just like Donald Trump here in a 500 page book on the deep maps of meaning under girding philosophy and myth not only in Western civilization but in comparative religion across across the world yeah that sounds just like Trump that's just like Trump he's an intellectual just like what in the world and then again it's about the only reason that we hate the media though is apparently because we're all rubes and Donald Trump suckered us into it what utter absolute horse crap well

have a lot to say about yeah I was informed last week that I had said that it was Yee which mistakenly thought that when it was like Yee that it was like Jesus but apparently it's yay so I've been I've been disabused of my mispronunciation of one of the most important nicknames in the history of mankind but for all of my discussions of yay yay my discussions of yay you'll yay to come my

Kirk which is hilarious I know both Candice and Charley and its really really really funny so everything is hilarious and funny and a quick clarification if I did not make clear last week I think all of this is ridiculous and stupid I think that what Kanye is doing insofar as he is speaking up on behalf of individualism is a good thing but I think that the worship of celebrity in general is hilarious and stupid I think the worship of Kanye and in specific is really stupid but Kanye is is doing something that I think is deeply necessary because the closed mindedness of the left is so crazy they're calling Jordan Peterson an alt right Nick and they are suggesting that joy Reid gave a good apology the other day they are so closed off they have closed the window of acceptable discourse so tightly that anyone who is even slightly outside that window of acceptable discourse now must be banned so Kanye West came out last week of course in the greatest story in human history and suggested that not all black folks have to vote Democrat chance the rapper by the way tweeted the same thing and then backed off of it then chance the rapper said I understand it's true that not all black people have to vote Democrat but I shouldn't be saying that at this important time when Trump is president which is like what the hell and well what is it I mean real real pansy move dude I mean real pansy move if you're gonna say the black people don't have to vote Democrat that is true no matter who is the president you can say I don't like Trump but black people don't have to vote Democrat this is true yeah but in any case Kanye made a big splash when he said that he's thinking for himself now and then obviously meeting with Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk is just more evidence that he is thinking for himself it's pretty fascinating in hilarious well the now president Trump is touting Kanye suited a speech on Saturday night combating the White House Correspondents Association dinner and and here is president Trump allowing Kanye West and by the way so good it's so good and he saw that when he sees that african-american unemployment is the lowest in history you know people are watching that's a very important thing he's done for his legacy it's a very important thing but Hispanic unemployment lowest level in history it's just incredible ok so Kanye comes out and Trump of course is willing to go out there and talk about and then Kanye did something else and this actually think it's kind of cool a cowl hood I will acknowledge when when Kanye does something that's cool right I think that it's cool that he's speaking about individualism then he did something else you released a track called yay versus the people I got it right this time it's not Yi it's yay versus the people even though it's spelled Yee all right and his his rap song is with a rapper named ti which is of course his given name he came out of his mother's womb and they called him ti and and Kanye and Kanye is rapping with ti and the point of this rap song is that they are discussing exactly what Kanye has been doing and he lets Ti go at him he lets see I say dude you're selling out black folks and it's really terrible what you're doing and good for Kanye right I mean this is something that we've tried to do with the daily wire like we used to have John Nolte right over here John Nolte is a very very Pro Trump guy and I disagree with him about a lot of things but what I said is listen it's a point of view I think is worth clarifying and in our conflict you can see the clarification so Kanye is actually hosting a debate here a Kanye is saying come on into my house and we're going to have a rap battle with each other about an issue that matters which is kind of a cool thing I'll acknowledge this is kind of anything now I think the song sucks but I'm know kind of sort of rap wait I think I think all rap songs suck basically but here's Kanye and Ti talking about yay-yay versus the people this back and forth back and forth and if you can't hear what he's actually saying says I never ever stopped fighting for the people this Kanye actually we're in this handle show people that we equal and then Ti responds you got to see the vantage point of the people what you met what you what makes you feel equal makes them feel evil and then he says that's the problem with this damnation all blacks got to be Democrats man we ain't made it off the plantation and then TI responds f who you chooses your political party you representing dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted with blatant disregard for the people who put you in position don't you feel an obligation to them and then Kanye responds I feel an obligation to show people new ideas and if you want to hear them they're go to right here make America great again had a negative perception I took it war rocked it gave it a new direction at an empathy carrot and love and affection and y'all simply questioning my methods and can quibble with the with the rhyme scheme there but what he's attempting to do here is actually something kind of neat but he's attempting to do here is actually host again a debate about an issue inside the black community which is something more than Tappin in popular culture any time in the recent past and then at the very end at the very end Kanye says all right tip we could be rapping about this all day man why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk so there's actually really cool what he did there like I can't believe this what kanye west did is a cool thing well Kanye West stood is something that I've been Shapiro approve okay I approve it it's a good thing like this is an actual good use of rap for opening up minds and opening up debate and again it's not just about him saying that he likes Trump it's about actually opening up debate which is really a kind of any thing so in just a second I want to talk a little bit about a more serious topic but you know first I need to finish up this kind of stuff so Kanye for people I think let's put this way you can appreciate what Kanye did in that song and what he's been doing by saying to black folks think for yourself have individual ideas stop thinking about identity stop thing about group identity I don't think of yourself as black guy and therefore you have to have this opinion think of yourself as your name here and now you have to have any opinion that you want to have and that's a really good thing that Kanye has just done is also incumbent on people on the right to recognize that justice Kanye's doing a good thing doesn't mean he's right way Kanye is not a conservative and as pure demonstration of this Kanye tweeted out this the other day he tweeted out that his hero's Emma Gonzales and Emma Gonzales is of course the Parkland survivor who has made a big issue of saying that everyone who disagrees with her is bad person just like a lot of the other parkland survivors he says my hero Emma Gonzales so don't worship celebrity acknowledge when Konya does something right and then recognize that this dude is not reading Edmund Burke okay he's not a guy who is versed in the Federalist Papers now maybe he will be maybe he'll learn that would be great and again I'm glad that he's opening his mind up and I'm glad he's encouraging other people to do this this is a direct result by the way of the left incapacity to let people think for themselves what's happening right now is that the left is so intolerant that even people who were purportedly on the left before are saying you know I can't deal with these people you people are just awful proof of that comes courtesy of a guy named Jeremy Lamb so Jeremy Lamb is a is some dude who I've never heard of before but he had a hundred and sixty-nine thousand likes on this suite there's a girl named Dom Kezia cos he yeah she's a high school girl very pretty white high school girl and she is and she has pictures of herself wearing a what looks like a kimono basically she's wearing a she's wearing a Chinese looking dress right to prom and she looks very pretty in all of this and she had some of the 57,000 likes Jeremy Lamb who's some leftist intellectual he tweeted out my culture is not your GG prom dress and my culture is not your Gd prom dress now I've never heard of this guy before he like fourteen hundred followers on Twitter but he now has a hundred and sixty-nine thousand likes on that tweet so it's all about cultural appropriation so this is this girl in high school wears a prom dress based on Chinese culture and now it's all cultural appropriation just to demonstrate how stupid this is Jeremy lamb also tweeted this hey Jeremy lamb also tweeted I'm eating tamales with chopsticks this is why America was founded what happened to cultural appropriation Jeremy came but the left is so but the left is so insane that they're deeply worried about a white girl wearing a Chinese dress because it's beautiful not meant in any way to disparage Chinese people there's a difference between somebody walking around in black face which is disparaging right inherently disparaging and somebody who is you know and mocking black people and somebody who is spending their day walking around singing rap lyrics or my rap lyrics in rap is a is a form of art that sprang from Black Moon just like jazz is a form of arts that sprang from the black community I like jazz that cultural appropriation know what makes America wonderful is cultural appropriation it's taking awesome things from other cultures and then integrating them into your regular life but again the left is so intolerant that everybody must be called out how intolerant to the left this is an insane story there's also a story today about I'm not kidding you a vegan who's ripping on another vegan because this vegan had given non vegan ice cream to a child not joking okay this is now intolerant crazy the left is hey there's a woman that named avocado hoe okay pulled up to my driveway to find a little girl crying she didn't have money for the ice cream van like her friends did so I gave her enough money to get herself a nice big ice cream with sauce sprinkles and a flake she was so happy and soon had ice cream around her mouth and her militant vegan Anthony dagger dagger read the tweet above and then decided to private message his fellow vegan to chastise her and when somebody said lighten the eff up he posted the private messages to Twitter to call her out so Anthony dagger wrote I usually do not do this but I feel like this is appropriate to post since this person is claiming to be a vegan even though she admitted to buying non vegan ice cream for someone else defended what she did when I spoke with her privately hoping that would make her less likely to be defensive though I should have not had to worry about that even though I was respectful and blocked me rather than admitting I was right and that you should not have bought the non vegan ice cream for that child okay so I guess that it's cultural appropriation some sort of evil for a vegan to buy a non vegan child ice cream by the way I keep kosher if I saw a poor kid on the street I would give that kid money to buy food regardless of where that kid bought kosher food because I'm not an idiot okay but the left is so intolerant that even if you buy food for children you buy food for a child it has to be vegan it has to be sjw approved food for the child or even somehow violated the compact of Nations and then they wonder why people like Kanye are looking at scans and saying guys I can't hang out with you anymore sorry you guys are the worst okay so meanwhile in major world news North Korea continues to to be in the news there's this peace summit that's been going on with kim jeong-hoon arriving in south korea and they've been having peace talks and the South Korean Prime Minister or president he's come out and he's said that they are in the midst of peace talks that are going to unify the Korean Peninsula now there is a piece of information I'd like to add to this talk and that is that while Kim jong-un says that he's going to dismantle his nuclear sites the reality is that North Korea's nuclear test site collapsed and may be out of action that was reported four days before the actual summit began so now they're saying right now that they gave up the North Koreans have site but in reality and the North Koreans has I collapsed on its own which is a pretty good reason to say that you're gonna give it up so according to the Guardian North Korea's main nuclear test site has partially collapsed under the stress of multiple explosions possibly rendering it unsafe er for their testing and leaving it vulnerable to radiation leaks a study by Chinese geologist has shown the findings could cast doubt on North Korea's sincerity in announcing last weekend it would stop nuclear weapons at the site ahead of Friday summit between the country's leaders Kim Jong hoon and the South Korean president moon jae-in now I think that it is important to note this because everybody is so all-fired excited about everything having to do with the North Korean situation that suddenly Kim seems to be making all sorts of concessions if the concessions are not concessions your excitement is unwarranted okay he actually has to concede something otherwise he's just faking you out we know this because we're now learning that tonight Benjamin Netanyahu is going to give a major address from Israel in which he lists off from a bunch of declassified documents a bunch of information showing that Iran has been cheating on its nuclear deal so while the Obama bros continue to go around talking about the Iran nuclear deal was a great savior of Western civilization it turns out the Iranians have been cheating and pursuing nuclear weapons there's great excitement in the press about the historic nature of the Obama Iran deal it turns out that that was a complete disaster the same thing could easily happen with regard to North Korea okay time for some things I like some things I hate and then we'll do a quick Federalist paper so things I like I'm gonna have to do Avengers tomorrow because I have a few words on Avengers and I want to get people that next ready to see it before I spoil it but the thing I like today is a book called skin in the game by Nassim Nicholas Taleb taalib the book is a sequel to the Black Swan which was all about sort of weird events that happen that you can't expect skin in the game is about the idea that if they're if you're in the business of making predictions the people who actually are betting something of themselves on that prediction right if you are if you're trying to follow somebody's market advice and then you can actually have a clearer view into their portfolio it is better to look at their portfolio didn't follow their market advice because they're gonna put skin in the game they're gonna put their money where their mouth is anybody who's willing to put their money where their mouth is is obviously more trustworthy in their predictions because they obviously believe their own predictions one of the big problems in the prediction business is that there are very few effects to making a wrong prediction right like I actually put my money where my mouth was in 2016 to my everlasting regret considering I lost a bunch of money on the 2016 election but you know at least it was genuine or I wasn't be asking you about the data and I nobody's put my money where my mouth was and the same thing is true in your life the people who you should trust are the people who are willing to sacrifice for their position not the people who are not willing to sacrifice for their position okay time for a couple of things that I hate okay so the thing that I hate number one Pope Francis came out and tweeted something really really dumb somebody asked me in the mailbag a couple of weeks ago ago about Pope Francis and what I thought of him and I said I thought that he was more of a Liberation Theology than anything else I think that he's a far left think her here's what he tweeted quote do we really want peace then let's ban all weapons so we don't have to live in fear of war oh I'm glad you thought of this if only someone had thought in history about banning all weapons also as Jonah Goldberg asks how would you enforce this ban how would you make sure that no one can have weapons make that require a weapon to ensure that no one has a weapon also before there were complex weapons the death rate in society was actually significantly higher than it is now so all of this is deeply stupid but pie-in-the-sky solutions seem to be something that Pope Francis is very fond of I am NOT a big fan of this particular Pope I think that his predecessors were much better than he at his job so there is that okay other things that I hate gyms commis still hanging around and my favorite thing about James Comey is that he's trying to pretend he's not cashing in when he is clearly cashing in so here's James Comey on Meet the Press trying to explain that he's not actually cashing in he is I cannot imagine why an FBI director would seek to essentially cash in on a book when the investigation it's very much alive should have waited to do his memoir should you wait it I hope she'll read it and and see that it's not about the investigation it's about not even about Donald Trump it's about something much broader that I thought it was important to talk about now okay no that's no no no no no you're here for the gash okay we all understand your hurtful Akash just say you're here for the cache say listen I was gonna tell the story one way or another I may as well am I gonna pretend that I'm not making some money off this book of course I'm not gonna pretend that but I think it's important to get it out there but the whole I am just so far above the fray routine not not effective okay time for a quick Federalist Papers so as I say every week we do a Federalist paper we are all the way up to Federalist 26 and making steady progress through the Federalist Papers been doing it now for six months obviously so Alexander Hamilton wrote Federalist 26 and in this Federalist paper he talks about the the possibility that's being posed by a lot of the states that maybe the national legislature should not be able to exercise more making Authority which raises the question okay who should be able to exercise war-making Authority should be the executive probably not because then that would make them the king should it be the legislature well it's not the legislature who else would it be so Alexander Alexander Hamilton says the legislature is the proper place for funding and maintaining a standing army and that's been true in Britain since the Glorious Revolution and then he as the legislature of the United States will be obliged by this provision once at least in every two years to deliberate upon the propriety of keeping a military force on foot to come to a new resolution on the point and to declare their sense of the matter by a formal vote in the face of their constituents they're not at liberty to vest in the executive department permanent funds for the support of an army if they were even and cautious enough to be willing to propose it in it so improper a confidence he's saying that the legislature has to remain in control so we can argue about whether to grow or shrink the military obviously in reality the military has continuously grown since so at least Bill Clinton's days Barack Obama tried to cut it back somewhat Bill Clinton tried to cut it back somewhat but for different reasons simply because they believe the United States should not be as muscular on the world stage the legislature has not in fact been a good check on the executives war-making Authority the founders believe that the legislature should be a check on that because they believed that the executive branch was always going to have an impetus toward growth of the military and growth of intervention ISM it's time for the legislature to take a lot of that authority back which they have not done and I hope that at some point they will already so we'll be back into my with much much more as I say Bendre minutes now who from Israel's supposed to make a big statement tonight about the Iran deal and we will cover all of it tomorrow i'm ben shapiro this is the bench shapiro
