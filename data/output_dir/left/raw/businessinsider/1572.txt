Joe<font color="#E5E5E5"> Biden was pushed by Obama and other</font>

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:15,089
Democrats to step aside for Hillary when

3
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,810
Hillary had her health issues some

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,949
Democratic leaders began speculating

5
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,890
that Hillary needed a contingency plan

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Democrats needed a contingency plan</font>

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,349
and some peace some of them were saying

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,929
if her health gets worse maybe she

9
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,780
should step aside for Joe Biden which is

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,480
an irony<font color="#E5E5E5"> because Joe Biden was pushed by</font>

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,230
Obama and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> Democrats to step aside</font>

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,210
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hillary because usually it's the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">vice president they lay out the red</font>

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,410
carpet for and in this case Obama laid

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,500
out the red carpet for his former rival

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,329
who you know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had gone to amazing</font>

17
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,879
lengths to kill the Clinton machine and

18
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,910
they did I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Barack Obama candidate for</font>

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,600
president and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I approved this message</font>

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,049
it's what's wrong with politics today

21
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:10,790
Hillary Clinton will say anything to get

22
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,000
elected<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he kind of led everyone back</font>

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,180
to the Clinton<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and they</font>

24
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,369
sidelined<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe Biden because they thought</font>

25
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:23,119
that Joe Biden has this problem with GAF

26
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,399
sending tends to shoot his mouth off

27
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:27,259
sometimes but<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they didn't realize</font>

28
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the rise of Trump is that Joe Biden</font>

29
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,830
is the ultimate statesman compared to

30
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,569
trunk Trump's you know bluster is so

31
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:40,880
huge that Biden's would have been

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,009
dwarfed by comparison so he could have

33
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:44,899
basically just walked<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the White</font>

34
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:47,929
House and been seen as a Truman s figure

35
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:50,509
so if I were Joe Biden I would be really

36
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:53,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">angry at Obama and all those people who</font>

37
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,850
said you step aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and give it to</font>

38
00:01:55,850 --> 00:00:00,000
Hillary
