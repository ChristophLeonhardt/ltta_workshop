PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. 
 
JUST THIS WEEK PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SAID TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF 
ICE IN HIS WORDS ARE INCREDIBLE 
PEOPLE AND I KNOW THAT TO BE 
TRUE. 
INCREDIBLE PATRIOTS. 
THE PRESIDENT SENT ME HERE 
TODAY WITH A VERY SIMPLE 
MESSAGE. 
WHILE I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY 
AT A TIME WHEN SOME PEOPLE ARE 
ACTUALLY CALLING FOR THE 
ABOLITION OF ICE, IN THIS WHITE 
HOUSE, LET ME BE CLEAR, WE ARE 
WITH YOU 100%. 
AND AS THE PRESIDENT SAID LAST 
NIGHT WE WILL ALWAYS STAND 
PROUDLY WITH THE BRAVE HEROS OF 
ICE AND OUR BORDER PATROL. 
>> AND BEFORE I GO FURTHER LET 
ME GIVE THANKS TO A FEW OTHER 
GREAT LEADERS. 
FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO 
THANK KRISTEN NIELSON FOR HER 
STRONG AND RESIDENCE LAWSUIT 
LEADERSHIP FROM OUR DEPARTMENT 
OF HOMELAND SECURITY. 
SHE HAS STOOD STRONG FOR THE 
COURAGEOUS MEN AND WOMEN OF 
THIS AGENCY AND THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE AND OUR SAFETY HAVE BEEN 
ADVANCED AS A RESULT. 
WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING 
THE SIXTH SECRETARY OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY SQUEAKIER SHONN 
NIELSON FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE 
UNITED STATES. 
LET ME ALSO TAKE A MOMENT TO 
RECOGNIZE A NEW LEADER OF THE 
AGENCY AS OF MONDAY OF THIS 
WEEK BUT A MAN WHO HAS SPENT 
MORE THAN 33 YEARS ENFORCING 
AND UP HOLDING OUR LAWS, 
DEFENDING OUR BORDERS AND 
SEEING TO THE LAW AND ORDER AND 
THE PROTECTION OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE, JOIN ME IN THANKING 
ACTING DIRECTOR RONALD LATELA 
FOR A CAREER OF SERVING OUR 
NATION AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS. 
FINALLY LET ME SAY THANK YOU 
FOR ALL OF YOU WHO ARE HERE 
TODAY AND ALL OF YOU WHO ARE 
WATCHING ALL ACROSS THIS NATION 
AND THE MORE THAN 400 OFFICES 
OF THE U.S. IMMIGRATIONS AND 
CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT. 
YOU ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF 
ENFORCING AMERICA'S LAWS AND 
ENSURING OUR VITALITY OF THIS 
NATION AND THE SECURITY OF OUR 
PEOPLE AND YOU HAVE OUR THANKS, 
THE THANKS OF OUR PRESIDENT AND 
I WANT TO ASSURE YOU, YOU HAVE 
THE THANKS AND THE ADMIRATION 
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
IT'S BEEN TRUE THIS AGENCY WAS 
FOUNDED 15 YEARS AGO OVER THE 
YEARS I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO 
MEET COUNTLESS ICE AGENTS AND 
BORDER PATROL OFFICERS. 
I WAS RECENTLY WITH THE 
SECRETARY OF IMPERIAL VALLEY, 
CALIFORNIA AND I NEVER FAIL TO 
BE INSPIRED. 
WHEN I'M AROUND MEN AND WOMEN 
WHO HAVE ANSWERED A CALL TO UP 
HOLD THE LAWS OF THIS NATION 
THROUGHOUT THIS GREAT AND 
STORED AGENCY. 
THE TRUTH IS, YOUR COURAGE, 
YOUR DETERMINATION, YOUR 
DEDICATION TO THE LAW AND TO 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE INSPIRES ME 
AND INSPIRES THE PEOPLE OF THIS 
COUNTRY. 
AT THIS AGENCY AS THE SECRETARY 
JUST DESCRIBED, MORE THAN 
20,000 PATRIOTS STAND EVERY DAY 
INVESTIGATORS, FIELD OFFICERS, 
SPECIAL AGENTS, ANALYSTS EACH 
AND EVERY DAY STAND FOR THE 
RULE OF LAW IN THIS NATION AND 
STAND FOR THE INTEREST OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
YOU STEP UP TO ENFORCE OUR 
SYSTEM OF LEGAL IMMIGRATION AND 
THE TRUTH IS EVERY DAY, EVERY 
DAY MEN AND WOMEN OF ICE ALSO 
CONFRONT CRIMINAL ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS WHO ENDANGER OUR 
COMMUNITIES AND PRAY ON OUR 
MOST VULNERABLE. 
OUR ICE AGENTS ARE BUSY EVERY 
DAY TAKING THEM OFF THE 
STREETS. 
YOU FOUGHT VICIOUS GANGS LIKE 
MS13 AND STOPPED HUMAN 
TRAFFICKERS AND DRUG CARTELS 
THAT ARE POISONING OUR YOUTH 
AND APPREHENDED TERRORISTS WHO 
HAVE COME INTO OUR COUNTRY AND 
CHALLENGED OUR WAY OF LIFE AND 
HARM OUR PEOPLE. 
THE TRUTH IS THE STATISTICS 
DON'T TELL THE TALE BUT THEY 
ARE WORTH REPEATING. 
IN 2017 U.S. IMMIGRATIONS AND 
CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT MADE 4,818 
GANG ARRESTS INCLUDING THEY 
TOOK FROM THE STREETS 796 
MEMBERS OF THE MS13 GANGS AND 
OUR COMMUNITY IS SAFER AS A 
RESULT. 
 
>> THERE WERE NEARLY 33,000 
ARRESTS BY ICE PERSONNEL, 
CRIMINAL ARRESTS, INDIVIDUALS 
WHO CAME INTO THIS COUNTRY 
ILLEGALLY AND THEN PURSUED 
CRIME AGAINST OUR PEOPLE. 
NEARLY A MILLION POUNDS OF 
NARCOTICS WERE SEIZED BY ICE 
AGENTS IN 2017 ALONE. 
AND MOST TOUCHINGLY TO ME AS A 
FATHER, ICE AGENTS RESCUED 518 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS AND 
904 CHILDREN SUBJECT TO CHILD 
EXPLOITATION WERE RESCUED BY 
ICE AGENTS ALL ACROSS AMERICA. 
WE ARE ENFORCING OUR LAWS AND 
PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE. 
 
>> YOU DO ALL THIS BECAUSE YOU 
LOVE YOUR COUNTRY. 
YOU DO ALL THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE 
CALLED TO SERVE. 
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I AND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT 
BEHIND THESE STATISTICS AND 
THIS WORK YOU ALSO DO SO OFTEN 
TIMES WITHOUT REGARD TO YOUR 
PERSONAL SAFETY. 
MEN AND WOMEN OF ICE LIKE ALL 
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU HAVE 
ANSWERED A CALL THAT REQUIRES 
YOU TO PUT THE LIVES OF YOUR 
COUNTRY MEN AHEAD OF YOUR OWN. 
AND I WANT YOU AND YOUR LOVED 
ONES TO KNOW WE UNDERSTAND 
THIS. 
WE APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND 
THE RISKS THAT YOU FACE AND 
WHEN YOU COME INTO CONTACT WITH 
VIOLENT CRIMINALS AND ENFORCE 
THE LAW AND REMOVE DRUG DEALERS 
AND GANG MEMBERS FROM OUR 
STREETS FROM OUR FAMILIES. 
IN RECENT YEARS TRAGICALLY 
ATTACKS ON YOU AND YOUR FELLOW 
OFFICERS HAS RISEN 
DRAMATICALLY. 
IN 2017 ATTACKS ON COLLEAGUES 
INCREASED BY NEARLY 75%. 
AND AT ICE, ASSAULTS ON YOUR 
OFFICERS NEARLY TRIPLED IN 
2017. 
BUT REMARKABLELY BUT NOT 
SURPRISINGLY, THESE ATTACKS 
HAVE NOT DIMINISHED YOUR 
COMMITMENT OR YOUR COURAGE OR 
YOUR DETERMINATION TO ENFORCE 
OUR LAWS. 
I SEE IT IN YOUR FACES AS I'M 
ADDRESSING YOU TODAY AND I SEE 
IT EVERY TIME THAT I'M WITH ICE 
AND BORDER PATROL PERSONNEL. 
THE CHALLENGE IS ONLY STEAL, 
THE RESOLVE IS COURAGEOUS MEN 
AND WOMEN WHO HAVE THE 
CHARACTER TO SERVE AND I WANT 
TO ASSURE YOU THESE CHALLENGES 
AND THE CHALLENGES YOU FACE 
HAVE ONLY STRENGTHENED THE 
RESOLVE OF THIS PRESIDENT AND 
THIS ADMINISTRATION TO STAND 
WITH YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. 
 
I WANT TO ASSURE YOU AS I 
TRAVEL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THAT 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THAT 
MEN AND WOMEN OF ICE ARE 
AMERICAN HEROS. 
YOU ARE DOING AN IMPORTANT JOB. 
YOU ARE OFTEN DOING A DANGEROUS 
JOB. 
AND YOU ARE DOING IT FOR THEM. 
AND I WANT TO PROMISE YOU THAT 
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
WORK. 
TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS AGENCY 
HAS BOTH THE SUPPORT, THE 
RESPECT AND THE RESOURCES THAT 
YOU DESERVE TO DO THE JOB THAT 
YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED TO DO. 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORT YOU 
BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW IMPORTANT 
YOUR MISSION IS. 
BUT AS WE ALL HAVE SEEN IN THE 
PRESS LATELY, THE HEROS OF ICE 
ARE BEING ATTACKED AND 
DEMONIZED FOR THE WORK THAT YOU 
DO IN AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE IN 
RECENT WEEKS. 
ICE HAS BEEN TARGETED WITH 
PROTESTS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY 
NOT ONLY ON THE JOB BUT IN 
PUBLIC SQUARE AND SOCIAL MEDIA 
AND FOR MANY OF YOU EVEN AT 
YOUR HOMES. 
THE HASHTAG ABOLLISH ICE IS NOW 
TAKING PLACE ON THE INTERNET. 
PROTESTORS CHANT NO BAN, NO 
WALL, NO BORDERS AT ALL AT 
PROTESTS AROUND THE COUNTRY. 
ICE OFFICERS AND LEADERSHIP 
HAVE HAD THEIR PERSONAL 
INFORMATION EXPOSED ON SOCIAL 
MEDIA AND THREATS TO THEIR 
FAMILIES HAVE FOLLOWED THIS. 
LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ON THIS 
POINT, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE 
EVERY RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN 
PEACEFUL PROTESTS BUT THESE 
THREATS AGAINST ICE OFFICERS 
AND THEIR FAMILIES MUST STOP 
AND THEY MUST STOP NOW. 
 
THE SAD FACT IS THOUGH IT ISN'T 
JUST THE EXPRESSION OF THE 
RADICAL LEFT WHO HAVE BEEN 
SPEAKING OUT AGAINST ICE 
LATELY. 
THE OPPOSITION OF ICE HAS MOVED 
TO THE CENTER OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY ITSELF. 
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT THE 
DEMOCRATS COULDN'T MOVE FARTHER 
TO THE LEFT, LEADING MEMBERS OF 
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY INCLUDING 
CANDIDATES FOR HIGHER OFFICE 
ARE ACTUALLY OPENLY ADVOCATING 
THE ABOLITION OF ICE. 
AN AGENCY THAT PROTECTS THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND OUR 
COMMUNITIES EVERY SINGLE DAY. 
SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN, 
SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLEBRAND AND 
THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, 
BILL DE BLASIO HAVE CALLED FOR 
ICE'S ABOLITION. 
A LEADING CANDIDATE FOR 
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK ACTUALLY 
EVEN APPAULINGLY CALLED THIS 
AGENCY A TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION. 
LET ME BE CLEAR ON THIS POINT, 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A 
RIGHT TO THEIR OPINIONS. 
BUT THESE SUREYOUS ATTACKS ON 
ICE BY OUR POLITICAL LEADERS 
MUST STOP. 
 
THE TYPE OF LANGUAGE THAT'S 
BEING USED TO DESCRIBE THE MEN 
AND WOMEN OF THIS AGENCY AND 
THE WORK THAT YOU DO EVERY DAY 
IS UNACCEPTABLE BUT YOU KNOW 
IT'S NOT JUST ME SAYING IT. 
DESPITE THESE CALLS FROM TOP 
DEMOCRATS EVEN TODAY THE 
LIBERAL EDITORIAL PAGE OF THE 
WASHINGTON POST HAD A LEAD 
EDITORIAL ENTITLED ICE IS THE 
WRONG TARGET FOR OUTRAGE. 
IN THEIR EDITORIAL AND I QUOTE 
THE WASHINGTON POST 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE 20,000 
EMPLOYEES OF ICE MANAGED MORE 
THAN DEPORTATIONS THEY WROTE. 
IT'S INVESTIGATED DIVISION 
HANDLED CYBER CRIME, HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING, NARCOTICS, COUNTER 
PROLIFERATION, OTHER MILITARY 
WEARS, CHILD EXPLOITATION. 
THEY WENT ON TO SAY AND I QUOTE 
IN THE WASHINGTON POST THOSE 
ARE ALL VITAL AND LEGITIMATE 
FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT AS IS 
DEPORTATION. 
THEY AREN'T GOING TO BE 
ABOLLISHED NOR SHOULD THEY BE. 
>> YOU KNOW THE TRUTH IS THE 
CALLS TO ABOLISH ICE ARE NOT 
JUST OUTRAGEOUS, THEY ARE 
IRRESPONSIBLE. 
ABOLISHING ICE WOULD MEAN MORE 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, PEOPLE 
BEING ABLE TO COME INTO OUR 
COUNTRY. 
LAST YEAR ICE ACTUALLY REMOVED 
226,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM 
OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR 
COUNTRY. 
ABOLISHING ICE WOULD MEAN MORE 
VIOLENT CRIME. 
LAST YEAR ICE ARRESTED MORE 
THAN 127,000 IMMIGRANTS WITH 
CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS OR FACING 
CHARGES FOR BREAKING OUR 
NATION'S LAWS INCLUDING 
CRIMINALS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
50,000 ASSAULT OFFENSES, 
11,000, 2,000 KIDNAPPING 
OFFENSES AND 1800 HOMICIDE 
OFFENSES. 
ABOLISHING ICE WOULD MEAN MORE 
VICIOUS GANGS LIKE MS13. 
NOW I'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED WITH 
YOU THE EXTRAORDINARY PROCESS 
WE MADE REMOVING MS13 GANG 
MEMBERS FROM OUR STREETS. 
THE TRUTH IS THE ARRESTS 
REPRESENTED 83% INCREASE IN THE 
LAST FULL YEAR. 
THAT'S REAL PROGRESS THAT'S 
MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR THE 
SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR 
FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES. 
ABOLISHING ICE ALSO WOULD MEAN 
MORE DRUGS IN OUR SCHOOLS AND 
ON OUR STREETS. 
LAST YEAR, ISIS SEIZED NEARLY A 
MILLION POUNDS OF FENTANYL AND 
OTHER--ICE SEIZED NEARLY A 
MILLION POUNDS OF PHENETOLE AND 
OTHER DRUGS. 
>> AS I MENTIONED LAST YEAR 518 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS 
NEARLY A THOUSAND VICTIMS OF 
EXPLOITATION IT. 
ABOLISHING WOULD GIVE A THAON 
EXPLOIT IMMIGRATION LOOP HOLES. 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 
BECAUSE OF THE TIRELESS WORK OF 
ICE AND THE ENTIRE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY OVER THE 
PAST 15 YEARS I TRULY BELIEVE 
THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS 
AGENCY OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS 
HAVE PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN 
ENSURING THAT NO MAJOR 
TERRORIST ATTACK OCCURRED ON 
OUR SHORES AND YOU DESERVE TO 
BE CREDITED. 
>> THE RECORD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF 
AND IT'S A RECORD OF 
ACCOMPLISHMENT AND SECURITY. 
EVERY DAY ICE MAKES AMERICA 
SAFER AND MORE SECURE AND EVERY 
CITIZEN OF THIS NATION IS 
BETTER OFF AND SAFE BECAUSE OF 
THE WORK THAT YOU DO. 
AND SO TODAY, TODAY I WANT TO 
MAKE IT CLEAR TO ALL OF YOU AND 
ALL OF THOSE LOOKING ON, UNDER 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE WILL 
NEVER APOLISH ICE. 
 
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID, WE WILL 
NEVER FAIL TO APPLAUD AND 
EXPAND AND EMPOWER THIS AGENCY 
WITH THE RESOURCES THAT YOU 
DESERVE. 
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID RECENTLY 
WE ARE NOT ABANDONING ICE. 
IN FACT IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE. 
WORKING WITH OUR REPUBLICAN 
MAJORITIES IN CONGRESS I'M 
PROUD TO REPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAS ALREADY GIVEN NEW FUNDING 
TO ACHIEVE THE MISSION. 
THIS YEAR WE INCREASED THE 
BASELINE BUDGET TO $7 BILLION A 
0% INCREASE OVER 2017 AND THE 
PRESIDENT CALLED ON CONGRESS TO 
GIVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OF 
MORE THAN $1 BILLION OF 2019 
INCLUDING THE HIRING OF 10,000 
ICE WORKERS AND INVESTIGATORS. 
OUR WORD IS HELP IS ON THE WAY. 
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE YOU 
HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THE 
SUPPORT THAT YOU DESERVE. 
 
>> AND JUST AS IMPORTANT IN 
THIS WHITE HOUSE AS YOU ALL 
KNOW WE ARE FIGHTING TO SECURE 
OUR BORDERS SO THAT ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS, GANG MEMBERS AND 
DANGEROUS CRIMINALS CAN'T ENTER 
OUR COUNTRY IN THE FIRST PLACE. 
THE PRESIDENT ALL RIGHT SIGNED 
INTO LATCH THE LARGEST IN 
NEARLY A DECADE AND WE STARTED 
TO BUILD THE FIRST 100 MILES IN 
THE NEW BORDER WALL. 
WE'LL CONTINUE TO CALL ON THE 
CONGRESS. 
CALL ON THE CONGRESS TO COME 
TOGETHER AROUND IMMIGRATION 
REFORMS AND SECURE OUR BORDER, 
BUILD A WALL, CLOSE THE LOOP 
HOLES THAT TOO OFTEN SERVED AS 
A MAGNET FOR VULNERABLE 
FAMILIES OR WORSE TO COME IN 
ACROSS OUR BORDER. 
JUST BE CONFIDENT OF THIS, 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND I 
WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR YOU. 
WE'LL ALWAYS STAND WITH YOU. 
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN 
THE FIGHT EVERY DAY. 
FOR THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK BUT 
I'M HERE AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT 
TO ASSURE YOU THAT THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE ARE WITH YOU. 
AS I TRAVEL ACROSS THIS 
COUNTRY, I HEAR THE ADMIRATION 
AND APPRECIATION THAT MILLIONS 
OF AMERICANS HAVE FOR THE MEN 
AND WOMEN OF THIS AGENCY. 
FOR THE SACRIFICES THAT YOU AND 
YOUR FAMILIES MAKE EVERY DAY SO 
THAT THEIR FAMILIES CAN BE SAFE 
AND SECURE. 
WE ARE ALL GRATEFUL FOR YOUR 
COURAGE. 
WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE RISK 
THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO TAKE TO 
UP HOLD OUR LAWS AND DEFEND OUR 
COUNTRY. 
WE ARE FRANKLY GRATEFUL THAT 
OUR NATION HAS MEN AND WOMEN OF 
SUCH CHARACTER ANDSELFLESSNESS 
WHO ARE WILLING TO STEP FORWARD 
IN THIS CAUSE. 
SO MEN AND WOMEN OF THE U.S. 
IMMIGRATIONS AND CUSTOMS 
ENFORCEMENT I'M HERE TO TELL 
YOU THAT WE STAND WITH YOU AND 
WE ALWAYS WILL. 
BUT NOT ONLY WILL WE STAND WITH 
YOU, GIVING YOU THE RESOURCES 
AND THE RESPECT THAT YOU 
DESERVE, BUT I ALSO WANT TO 
ASSURE YOU THAT YOU ARE IN OUR 
PRAYERS AND I KNOW YOU ARE IN 
THE PRAYERS OF TENS OF MILLIONS 
OF AMERICANS WHO UNDERSTAND THE 
RISKS THAT YOU TAKE. 
WHO UNDERSTAND THAT FOR MANY OF 
YOU WHEN YOU WALK OUT THE DOOR 
IN THE MORNING IT'S DIFFERENT 
LIKE IT IS FOR EVERY LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN THIS 
COUNTRY. 
YOU'VE RESPONDED TO NO ORDINARY 
CALLING. 
IT'S A CALLING WHERE YOU'VE 
DECIDED TO CONSIDER OTHERS MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN YOURSELF AND 
YOUR FAMILIES HAVE SUPPORTED 
YOU IN THIS CALLING. 
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT. 
AND SO YOU GO WITH OUR SUPPORT 
BUT YOU DO, YOU GO WITH OUR 
PRAYERS AND FOR MY PART I CAN'T 
HELP BUT REFLECT ON THE WORDS 
OF THE PSA LMIST IN MY HOPE 
THAT YOU WILL NOT FEAR THE 
TERROR OF NEITHER THE AIR OF 
THE FLIES BY DAY THAT AS YOU 
MAKE YOUR REFUGE NO HARM WILL 
OVER TAKE YOU EVER. 
THAT WILL BE OUR PRAYER. 
SO THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR OF 
ADDRESSING YOU TODAY. 
MORE IMPORTANTLY THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR SERVICE. 
THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO FOR 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EVERY DAY. 
TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THIS 
NATION AND THE SECURITY OF OUR 
PEOPLE. 
NOW I LEAVE HERE TODAY WITH 
RENEWED CONFIDENCE THAT YOU'LL 
CONTINUE TO DO JUST THAT. 
THAT DESPITE THE CRITICISM THAT 
MAY BE LEVELED BY SOME THAT I 
KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE TO DO YOUR 
JOB WITH DETERMINATION. 
YOU'LL UP HOLD THE RULE OF LAW. 
YOU'LL SEE TO THE INTEREST OF 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
AND WITH YOUR CONTINUED SERVICE 
ANDCOURAGE WITH THE SUPPORT OF 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND THE 
WHITE HOUSE AND WITH GOD'S 
HELP, I KNOW WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. 
AND WE'LL HAVE ALL OF YOU TO 
THANK. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
 
GOD BLESS YOU. 
GOD BLESS YOU AS IMMIGRATION 
AND CUSTOM ENFORCEMENT AND GOD 
BLESS THE UNITED STATES.
