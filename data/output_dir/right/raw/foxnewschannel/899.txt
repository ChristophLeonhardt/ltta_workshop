1
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:10,569
>> Neil: YOU KNOW, I JUST SHOOK

2
00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:12,605
THE HULK'S HAND.

3
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:13,472
HE BROKE IT.

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,241
SO ANYWAY, THE PRESIDENT, DID

5
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,308
YOU SEE THIS TODAY?

6
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,210
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,445
IT WAS SURREAL.

8
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:21,380
NO MATTER HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,715
PRESIDENT, I THOUGHT IT WAS

10
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:24,650
RIVETING TO WATCH.

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,520
HE FIELDED A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,422
SOME IN YOUR FACE, SOME NOT.

13
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:31,557
BUT IT WAS NONSTOP AND SOMETHING

14
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:33,959
TO WATCH.

15
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:42,635
SOMETHING FOR THE AGES.

16
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:43,903
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"'S

17
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:45,971
JILLIAN IS HERE AND JESSE IS

18
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:46,272
HERE.

19
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:49,141
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE LEFT OR THE

20
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:50,676
RIGHT, THE PRESIDENT, THEY

21
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,011
ALWAYS CRITICIZE HIM.

22
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,280
HE DID AN INFORMAL PRESS

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,181
CONFERENCE THAT LASTED ABOUT AN

24
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,383
HOUR WITH EVERYBODY CONCERNED.

25
00:00:57,383 --> 00:00:58,017
DID YOU SEE?

26
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,852
IT WAS RIVETING.

27
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,053
>> YEAH.

28
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:03,255
THEY CRITICIZE HIM FOR THIS NOW,

29
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:06,325
THE IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCE.

30
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:10,195
I THINK HE'S BECOME SO

31
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,199
POLARIZING, EITHER SIDE HAS

32
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:14,533
AGENDA.

33
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,101
>> Neil: BUT HE DID IT.

34
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,536
>> AND HE DID SOMETHING OUT OF

35
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,504
THE NORM.

36
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:19,705
AND IT WAS A NICE DAY.

37
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:20,906
WHY NOT HAVE THE PRESS

38
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:22,775
CONFERENCE OUTSIDE?

39
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:24,677
I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME

40
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:25,010
THING.

41
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,711
>> HE TOLD PEOPLE.

42
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:26,946
I'M GOING TO COME OUT.

43
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:28,948
>> AND SURPRISE!

44
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:31,083
>> Neil: A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE HE

45
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,685
HASN'T HAD A FORMAL PRESS

46
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:33,085
CONFERENCE.

47
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:34,153
>> I FEEL LIKE HE'S MISSED SOME

48
00:01:34,153 --> 00:01:36,188
OF THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PRESENT

49
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:37,690
A DISCIPLINED MESSAGE AND THINGS

50
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,324
LIKE THIS.

51
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:40,059
MAYBE THEY ARE UP IN THE AIR,

52
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,393
BUT IT DOES HELP DRIVE THAT

53
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,696
NARRATIVE FORWARD, ESPECIALLY IF

54
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:45,264
HE STAYS ON MESSAGE.

55
00:01:45,264 --> 00:01:46,699
>> HE DOESN'T HAVE A PRESS

56
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:47,866
CONFERENCE, PEOPLE ARE UPSET.

57
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:50,603
IF HE DOES, PEOPLE ARE UPSET.

58
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:52,338
HE DOES IT IN A WEIRD WAY.

59
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:54,840
THE MAIN WAY HE COMMUNICATES IS

60
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,308
THROUGH TWITTER AND WE HEAR WHAT

61
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:59,511
HE THINKS ON TWITTER.

62
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:00,245
I DON'T THINK A THOUGHT GOES

63
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:04,683
THROUGH HIS HEAD.

64
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:06,619
>> Neil: AND HE WILL PUT A

65
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,320
REPORTER DOWN AND THEN GOES

66
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,753
BACK.

67
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,288
BOOM, BOOM.

68
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:10,889
I'LL WELCOME IT.

69
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,627
>> THE STATISTIC YOU GAVE IS

70
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:17,363
LIKE OBAMA TAKING TEN QUESTIONS

71
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:18,464
AND TRUMP WILL TAKE 40.

72
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:21,100
IT'S SO POLARIZING NOW.

73
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,035
WE'VE ENTERED A NEW STAGE WHERE

74
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:24,637
THERE'S NO DECORUM ANYMORE.

75
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:26,872
THE REPORTERS WERE SUPPOSED TO

76
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:29,308
BE OBJECTIONABLE.

77
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:32,378
NOW THEY'RE GOING AT IT, SHOWING

78
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:32,945
THEIR BIAS.

79
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,614
>> I DO THINK THAT CONTRAST IS

80
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:36,081
DEEPER.

81
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:37,383
BECAUSE WE SAW A JOURNALIST

82
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:38,517
TAKING A STEP BACK AND NOT BEING

83
00:02:38,517 --> 00:02:41,654
THAT AGGRESSIVE IN THE OBAMA

84
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:41,954
YEARS.

85
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,390
I'M ALL FOR IT.

86
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,725
IF YOU DON'T WANT IT PRINTED,

87
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:48,494
DON'T LET IT HAPPEN.

88
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:49,895
GOODNESS SAKES, WE DIDN'T --

89
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:53,399
>> LOOK AT SARAH SANDERS'S PRESS

90
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:53,799
CONFERENCE.

91
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,268
PEOPLE WERE CRAZY.

92
00:02:56,268 --> 00:02:57,336
>> Neil: I DON'T THINK JUST

93
00:02:57,336 --> 00:03:00,572
BECAUSE YOU ASK QUESTIONS, YOUR

94
00:03:00,572 --> 00:03:01,674
NEWS IS FAKE.

95
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:02,975
THERE SHOULD BE MORE.

96
00:03:02,975 --> 00:00:00,000
>> SETS THE BAR IN YEARS TO
