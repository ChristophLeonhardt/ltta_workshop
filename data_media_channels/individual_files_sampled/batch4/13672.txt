The Hunger Games apparently happened in New York City last night it was the Met Gala and the Met Gala was honoring Catholic something-or-other it was I guess that they have this costume party every year at the macula and this one was I guess titled it was what was this was a stupid thing titled it was called Catholic bodies or something and and basically it's an excuse for celebrities to dress up like idiots okay the Metro mountain Metropolitan Museum of Art which is you know oh they have a lot of good stuff there but they also have a lot of crap they have the the the heavenly bodies fashion and the Catholic imagination now how many Catholics are actually at this event the answer is probably zero okay the vast majority of people who are showing up are people who are probably not Catholic don't go to church ever and it's hilarious that the same left that will complain about cultural appropriation is fine with appropriating your actual Catholic symbols of purity and and holiness and then using them in the possible costume so that's pretty amazing but I just want to go through some of the costumes and show you what these people are dressing like so first of all Solange Knowles what looked like she was simultaneously attacked by a squid and a jellyfish you know that's exactly what she looks like I can't describe it any better than a she's wearing like a black costume it looked inflatable like she just jumped in the pool and then on her head she's wearing like an old school halo and a do-rag so there's that and then there and then there's Frances McDorman who looks like she was attacked by a tree right I don't know what this has to do with Catholicism but her entire face is obscured by a bunch of like blue leaves apparently she faded back into nature so RIPD Frances McDorman and Solange Knowles both of whom I guess are dead thanks to their costumes eating them so that's that's pretty sad and then Katy Perry of course dressed up as a giant angel with enormous wings because she is just an angelic creature is katy perry sexually harassing the men who appear on american idol so it's good thing that she was waiting in heaven for Solange McDormand who are apparently dead and then there's also Pope Rianna who is presiding she wore a full-on Pope hat so Pope Rihanna was presiding it was apparently very difficult work work work work work presiding over the mass funeral there it's a very very rough night for Pope Rianna having preside over a funeral but the good news is that others attended the funeral so there was also Madonna the Queen Mother who attended the funeral wearing completely black dress with a giant cross in front Madonna of course has been using Catholic imagery for years in order to avoid the fact that that she is an attention-seeking piece of piece of human debris and then but now she's the Queen Mother and then the best I think was Karen Zilla vine who who hid the fact that she can't act beneath a costume that can only be described as a series of stripes and fish netting I think that what this actually looks like is that she was a steak that was seared for too long so ah right PETA Cara Delevigne who apparently slipped onto a barbecue and died being seared beyond recognition so we have a lot of celebrities were killed last night apparently according their costumes that was real sad and she wasn't the only one there are a few others as well Lana Del Rey who apparently was stabbed repeatedly in the heart but seems strangely at peace with Rowan murder and she's got a bunch of knives that are pointed directly into her heart I guess this is some sort of Catholic Catholic heart imagery and I said that was exciting and and for some reason who is that Jared Leto who's standing next to her dressed apparently as a mash-up of Jesus and Prince John from the Robin Hood cartoon made by Disney as soon as that's really exciting and and then there was Liberace who showed up oh sorry the sound Liberace is Tom Brady I'm wearing a black costume apparently he left his tiger at home Siegfried and Roy over here said that was pretty awesome as well and the Greta Gerwig showed up dressed completely as a nun which makes perfect sense because she directed also that movie about about nunnery so now we understand right she dress she directed a movie about Catholics and then she decided to enter a nunnery which is really exciting as well I'm glad that she could attend that mass funeral because that would been sad if she couldn't and then finally there was a Suzy Beck who showed up dressed as scarlet fever she is completely dressed in red she looks as though she and and the good news is that I assume that's her husband he looks like he's been afflicted by scarlet fever as well so it said that that makes a lot of sense the mask of the Red Death reenactment happening over at over at the Met Gala last night and I think we have a couple of more here and shailene woodley showed up from the future to make sure that everything was okay she showed up directly from the set of Blade Runner 20:59 and so she said she is here we're wearing I don't even know what this acid with Catholicism except she's here to save Sall from the future so shilling Woodley is here as well but Lily Collins was a little sad she she apparently was crying about it all she actually has like a makeup tear underneath her eye but don't don't cry Lily Collins I'm just joking none of these people are actually dead it's okay
