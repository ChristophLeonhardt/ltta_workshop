MEETING WITH DONALD TRUMP JR.,
JARED KUSHNER AND SOME RUSSIANS.
RELEASING NEARLY 2,000 PAGES OF
THE INTERVIEW ABOUT THAT
TONIGHT.
THAT COMMITTEE AND HE JOINS ME
NOW.
GREAT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.
THERE IS QUITE A BIT TO DISCUSS
WITH YOU.
WE ARE GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE.
LET ME TALK TO FIRST ABOUT THE
SUMMIT.
AT WHAT YOU MAKE OF WHAT
KIM JONG UN SAID IN TERMS OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF CANCELING?
SPEAK OF THE KIND OF PLAYED THIS
GAME IN THE PAST.
THE ONLY ADVICE I CAN GIVE
NORTH KOREA'S AND I HONESTLY
MEAN THIS, IF YOU ARE NOT
SERIOUS ABOUT DOING A DEAL WITH
THE PRESIDENT, IF YOU ARE NOT
WILLING TO GIVE UP YOUR NUKES
FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR
NORTH KOREA, DON'T MEET WITH THE
PRESIDENT.
THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO IS
SIT DOWN AND MEET WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THEN TRY TO
PLAY HIM BECAUSE IF YOU DO THAT
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A WAR AND
YOU WERE GOING TO LOSE IT.
SO IF YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS,
PLEASE DON'T MEET WITH THE
PRESIDENT.
>> Martha: THERE WAS SOME
SUGGESTION THAT JOHN BOLTON
MENTIONED THE LIBYA MODEL AND
THAT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A FACTOR
BECAUSE KIM JONG UN DOES NOT
WANT TO END UP LIKE
MUAMMAR QADDAFI.
MIKE POMPEO, THE SECRETARY OF
STATE, WAS ASKED A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT ASSURANCES WE MIGHT
BE WILLING TO GIVE KIM JONG UN
ON SECURITY BY CHRIS WALLACE.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
>> AS PART OF THAT, ARE WE IN
EFFECT SAYING TO KIM, IF YOU
GIVE US WHAT WE WANT, YOU CAN
STAY ON AND POWER?
>> WE WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE
SECURITY ASSURANCES TO BE SURE.
THIS HAS BEEN THE TRADE-OFF THAT
HAS BEEN PENDING FOR 25 YEARS.
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT MEANS?
>> I THINK HE'S RIGHT.
HERE'S THE WAY IT WORKS.
IF WE END THE KOREAN WAR, WHICH
HAS NEVER ENDED.
WE SIGNED A PEACE TREATY WITH
NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA,
CHINA AND UNITED STATES.
WE RECOGNIZE NORTH KOREA AS A
SOVEREIGN COUNTRY.
WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO INVADE
NORTH KOREA.
WE ARE NOT TRYING TO UNIFY
SOUTH KOREA AND NORTH KOREA.
WE JUST WANT NORTH KOREA TO GIVE
UP THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM
WHICH HAS THREATENED US AND THE
WORLD.
FOR THAT THEY WILL GET A
GUARANTEE OF SECURITY AND
HOPEFULLY A BETTER ECONOMY
BECAUSE THE SANCTIONS WILL BE
RELIEVED.
HERE'S THE OTHER CHOICE, KEEP
THREATENING AMERICA, KEEP
BUILDING NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND
ICBMs.
GET IN A WAR WITH DONALD TRUMP
AND LOSE IT.
THOSE ARE YOUR TWO CHOICES.
THE ONE KIM JONG UN CLEARLY HAS
PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO SAY THAT
IT WOULD BE CRAZY FOR HIM TO
GIVE UP THE BIGGEST WEAPON THAT
HE HAS IN THE BIGGEST WEAPON
THAT HE CAN HOLD OVER.
WE MAY BE SEEING HIM HAVING SOME
SECOND THOUGHTS HERE ON THAT
FRONT.
ALSO, WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF
NORTH KOREA WILL HAVE LIVED ON
THE DARK CONTINENT FOR ALL THESE
DECADES, AND WHAT'S TO STOP THEM
ONCE THEY HAVE NO NUKES AND THEY
HAVE A LOT OF LIGHT SHED INTO
THEIR COUNTRY FROM REBELLING
AGAINST THIS REGIME THAT HAS PUT
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
IN LABOR CAMPS?
>> YOU ARE THINKING TOO HARD
HERE.
HERE'S WHAT'S CRAZY.
THEY KEEP BUILDING ICBMS AND
BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP WON'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
THAT PROBABLY WORK WITH OBAMA
BUT I'M HERE TO TELL NORTH KOREA
THAT OUR PRESIDENT HAS DRAWN A
REDLINE.
IF YOU KEEP THREATENING THE
AMERICAN HOMELAND WITH A NUCLEAR
WEAPON WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY
YOUR REGIME, IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
SO IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE,
KIM JONG UN, YOU NEED TO SIT
DOWN WITH THE PRESIDENT AND DO A
DEAL GIVING UP YOUR NUKES.
IN RETURN WE WILL GUARANTEE YOUR
SECURITY END AND THE KOREAN WAR.
IF YOU KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE
DOING, YOU ARE MISCALCULATING
DONALD TRUMP.
HE'S NOT OBAMA.
YOU DO THIS AT YOUR OWN PERIL.
TO THOSE WHO ARE ADVISING
KIM JONG UN TO CONTINUE DOWN THE
PATH THAT YOU ARE GOING, BAD
ADVICE.
>> Martha: WE WILL SEE.
QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU ABOUT THE
PEACE IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES"
ABOUT MIKE PENCE AND THE
OPERATION THAT HE'S BUILDING TO
GIVE SUPPORT TO THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS THEY
HEAD INTO NOVEMBER.
THERE WAS SOME SUGGESTION IN THE
HEADLINE OF THAT PEACE WHICH WAS
PENCE IS TRYING TO CONTROL
PUBLIC AND POLITICS.
TRUMP AIDS AREN'T HAPPY AND THEY
QUOTED U.S. SAYING THIS.
THE WHITE HOUSE IS LOOKING FOR
PEOPLE TO STAY ON THE TEAM, NOT
BREAK AWAY FROM THE TEAM.
YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THE?
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS MIKE PENCE
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS MIKE PENC
MIKE PENCE, IT'S MUSIC TO MY
EARS.
AN ORGANIZED EFFORT TO SAVE THE
REPUBLICAN MAJORITY MAKES
PERFECT SENSE TO ME.
THERE'S NO MORE LOYAL PERSON TO
DONALD TRUMP THAN MIKE PENCE.
I'M GLAD THEY ARE DOING THIS.
