the weather might be frigid this time of year but the prospects for the American agriculture industry are bright commodity prices are healthy fueling a multi-billion dollar industry but here in the plains of the Indiana Heartland and across the US the fortunes of one of its pillars the American family farmer are fading you see more and more of the farms you know slowly slowly dwindling away there's going to be fewer farmers in the county every year at an average age of 58 farmers here are getting older and as massive farms some corporate-owned keep swallowing up smaller ones they're getting fewer I do believe I was meant to come back to the family farm and continue on and alongside with my dad Dan and Kelly Snipes are part of an Indiana State program to get more young people interested in farming we have fewer and fewer people who have been involved in farming so today just 1 percent of people are farmers so we have a growing disconnect between our population and food production but I also believe that maybe shifting here at Loyola we see a strong interest among students who are you know late teens early 20s and they're very interested in getting involved with the food system young farmers now even have their own dating sites but there's a catch starting a farm is expensive a new tractor can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars a new combine like those over there can go for 300 to 500 thousand and then of course there's the land so few young people who have an inherited a farm can ever afford to own one the snipes with the help of a Golden Retriever named farmer are the fourth generation of Dan's family to work this land if you want to own a large grain operation you know corn soybeans wheat which is what you know you see growing around here in Indiana unfortunately you really do have to be born into it or extremely wealthy they're struggling to carry on the family tradition each also works an outside job hoping one day this farm will be running full-time as it did for the past four generations john Hendren al jazeera Rochester Indiana
