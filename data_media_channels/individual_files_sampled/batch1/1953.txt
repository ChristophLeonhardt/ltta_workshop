a demilitarized zone is being created around Syria's adlib province a 20 kilometer deep strip of territory is now free of heavy weapons by October 15 it should have also been free of fighters considered terrorists by the international community the so called radical groups didn't pull back but hours before the deadline hi Atari regime the largest military alliance that controls much of the buffer area and the rest of the province signaled that it will comply in its statement hi epic leader sham said it appreciated efforts by those inside and outside which is believed to be a reference to Turkey to prevent an invasion and wide scale killing it also made reference to the foreign fighters saying we won't forget you the group may be trying to keep unity and prevent betrayal among its ranks that is why an explicit acceptance of the deal would worsen divisions a rejection would risk a military confrontation with Turkey which has said it is ready to use force against those who do not comply hiya Terry - M quietly met the deadline to withdraw heavy weapons from the zone last week it's not the first time the group has shown pragmatism the buffer zone deal does not call for a surrender or reconciliation with the Syrian government it created a new front line that protects regime strongholds and Russian military assets but many Syrians and the rebel controlled province remain skeptical they moved heavy weapons back some 10 kilometers or so but I don't support this it just makes it easier for the regime and Russia to advance into it Lib you cannot trust their regime and Russia this is all a game the aim is to cause the vision among rebel ranks that will lead to infighting that way it becomes easier for the regime to take the area everyone is lying to us the Syrian government has repeatedly said it Lib will eventually return to state control but Russia and Turkey have so far been the decision makers the deals sponsors need each other in the post-war phase I think it serves the interest of both parties so this is why I believe that this agreement will hold for for the time being and the Turks will be giving more time in order actually to try and to deconstruct the whole complexity of this situation inside Adler for the next few weeks and months a few days ago Russia said that it could accept a brief delay if it meant the spirit of the agreement was still upheld the deadline was missed but Syria's main power brokers seem committed to keeping the deal alive senator al Jazeera Beirut
