all right Owen Benjamin is with a stand-up comedian after podcast host pianist a large P a big penis huge penis I afraid to say he's never afraid to share his unique perspective it says on the sheet and it's gotten you banned from every the only place in California where you're now allowed to be I think I just passed a while where I'm banned from this room yeah I'm that permanently banned from Twitter it's hilarious but look Farrakhan isn't but I am oh well Farrakhan do you mean brother Farrakhan or Reverend just preaching love so what happened what you do what did you do now it was David ha gay I said that someone who you know doesn't you know it's not even a bad word you could say it on whatever but I said someone who doesn't have pubes can't tell a grown man rather natty can own a gun or not so fair enough yeah it's it to me it's a no brainer yeah and it's like to that I got this shame mob they kicked me off they kicked off my backup account I had Owen Bear German TV PE and they got to that too and then I got a strike on YouTube so I couldn't laugh strim anymoar all in one night just this big who's who's the mom aunt Eva and NAMBLA and all these just disgusting human being we nimbler is the boy lord man boys that yeah man-boy love it so pedophiles got you kicked a pedophile have like lobbyists now wait this is this is wonderful what this is pedophiles he said this man is dangerous because he made a joke again yeah cuz that was a Jordan Peterson on my on my show and we're talking about rather not pedophiles deserve free speech and I'm torn up about it because I'm a free speech absolutist but at the same time it drives me insane and we were like working out how to deal with that and when I stood up for the against trans children with the hormone blockers and stuff yeah it attracted a lot of people to me that that want to protect kids and so that also attracted a lot of pedophiles to me that hate me and so they are like proud now like vice even does articles so on does articles where it's like I'm a pedophile not a monster their whole thing is oh boy wait this is real so if you're a pedophile you are a Muslim is the definition of a monster yeah like I'm friends with people who've killed people and I can still be friends with them you know so much stole her bike that's kids but but anybody who hurts a kid there's like you know that there's no coming back from that if there's an intentional hurting of a child and and that's the newest part of the normalization process where it's like minor attracted people that's what they call themselves minor attractive yeah Maps or something it's like I'm dead serious and so I do a bit now about LGBTQ AI and how it's like they start with the elves and then just kept getting crazier and how the owls are now like we should have just knitted sweaters because uh because the whole the whole thing is based on no discrimination and your whole life has to be discrimination of course your discrete like I only have sex with one woman it's my wife that's called discrimination I don't eat this because it's not a banana that's discrimination so it's like you if you let everyone in the party you let everyone in the party and and you know it it went to the elves to the Gees and then the bees took a turn when it's you don't know if you can go camping with those guys you know you guys are they're down with anyone they're like anyone you like this is getting intense and then the tea's brought in post-modernism and now you got the piece so is there is there a limit to a I saw you do a routine it actually wasn't even a comedy routine it was actually a discussion about the n-word yeah is there is there a limit is there a danger that guys the people on the right when they take the red pill when they see that we're being silenced when they see that the silence is in is in service to a political point of view it's not just silencing people to be polite it's not to saying don't say that is a dirty word it's in service of a political point so a danger you go too far in the other direction you say yes absolutely yeah and that's why I took a lot of care to never say anything racist and I don't use that word in my life and I will say n-word on your show because we're friends I respect you but when you're going after the multi-headed headed Hydra you got to go for the heart and so that's the most taboo word there is and so I got fascinated by it like why it's such an archaic silly word it almost says more about the speaker of the word than the person it's it makes you sound like an ignorant person right and so I mean that brings me down the the road of the rhetorical conspiracy theory of the welfare state and how we have to continuously reinforce the black people by nature are victims therefore we can Rob trillions of dollars from our people and and I got fascinated by it and so yeah I do I don't want to be defined by the peat the crazy people who hate me and you have a great point about going too far the other direction but that's why I made sure I never use that word in my personal life and I don't say anything racist it's just like saying n-word I saw this this meme that blew my mind because it said if we take the n-word out of to kill a mockingbird what happens to rap lyrics and the thing that blew my mind was that they said n-word in an anti censorship meme and that was this weird manipulation because my mom teaches To Kill a Mockingbird and and Huck fan and a lot of these things that are now being censored like they're taking words right now no I know and so I'm like what does that say that people are complying to this even in a meme about censorship so I just went for it cuz his George Carlin says political correctness is fascism disguised as polite that's right that's right so he's hijacking our system of manners basically yeah what about I mean Christopher Hitchens wrote a piece when he said that women or not in which he said women are not as funny as men I agree with that in general but there's exception and the feminists were like that's not funny you know that's right so they proved his point immediately so the feminists come after you because you do a couple of bits you have a song that has every it's every man's relationship that actually made me cry I mean I made me laugh so hard I was oh thanks well that's the irony of my career my main thing is men and women stuff sure like I don't I don't like this this crazy PC turn it took yeah but um I was obligated to do it because I wasn't allowed to do men and women are different stuff and you can ignore politics but politics won't ignore you you know and so on what was it was required if feminists come out - yeah yeah yeah at first and then they just got exhausted you know and my wife is so she's Alma I didn't even realize how much kryptonite she has to feminists because she's half Hispanic she has her master's in engineering and she's a stay-at-home mom and she's hilarious and very supportive of me so it's just this crazy shut this country back 20 years I know she she was an engineer chose to be a stay-at-home mom fortunately because I I can work enough and hopefully not get banned by too many more platforms but just the love we have for each other that it's just so hard to to come it her and me now because I don't have that weakness of being a womanizer or any of that stuff that makes it so easy for feminists to put you in that hole and I don't have that okay so it's uh they can try but they just sounds silly and they're so far gone at this point like the wage gap has been disproven by MIT and that doesn't matter yeah we still have to have a wage equal wage day we heard about equal death my brother Jack 97% of work-related deaths or mail like when we gonna close that gap am I getting to underwater welding ladies come on lay some bricks so how bad did you still tour yeah it's it's it's oddly been good for my career it's almost like when you don't kneel and you you faced a swarm and you think okay I'm gonna now be an arborist like for real I still do tree work with my brother just so I know that they can't take it you can make a living you me yeah trees are gonna keep growing no matter how many people go to Yale so when you when you go on the road do you face you know actually no it's online it's all online oh my crowd is so nice too it's like all these clubs and theaters whenever it's over they're like they're your audience is so kind yeah and they're like family people and there's no protesting it's like it's all this this crazy online vitriol that comes from people that I honestly think they start they now hate joy like someone who's like oh I love my family I'm so honored to do that they're like you like David Hogg's pubes and you're like what it's like knock knock they're like home invasion statistics I know you're here you're being a buzzkill on purpose you know and I believe that there is privilege in the world but it comes from having married parents and stuff like I was raised well that's right and so is met as much as our families have been through a lot at least eight they were married and that's I do have a leg up in life and that's why because my parents had a stable home so that I could learn how to deal with chaos in the world it's not because I'm white you know do you think do you think this is getting better or worse I was just before you keep my horse it's getting it's like exponential I I now look at stuff I did on Comedy Central in 2014 and I would be literally labeled it just it's just it doesn't end there saying trees are racist I'm sorry I have no there's a whole thing going now and my brother loves trees and yeah and people now are sending me all these pictures where it's like they'll show these beautiful southern trees and people are like you shouldn't do that it's associated with lynchings no you're dead serious yeah there's now height privilege I'm serious you're really tall I mean I'm six happening downtown you there isn't there's high privilege it's six feet yes except you're not a lot of roller coasters you know there's a lot of oppression I know you go to all oppression that's where you go to old folks home you see no one my height so apparently we don't make make it too far but uh hey you know and our circulation isn't I hit my foot with an axe not that long ago I don't even feel it because it's so far away from my brain about two weeks you'll feel a little yeah the message will get I breastfed too long so but but these are people these people are they on the outskirts do you think of their socialist this stuff they're saying is so crazy but do they have do they you think they're real yeah because they oddly go along with expanding government right where it's like they're trying their their children trying to give power to their father that wants to kill them yeah you know it's it's it's these people the reason that they have power the reason I antifa wasn't I've seen an Tifa strangle a guy almost a death I know beat the hell out of people with sticks yeah and it's like no in person I saw that one yeah and it and it wasn't one of my events but it was crazy and and deceived these Don Lemon characters right out of the Hunger Games you know just as hello and to see that I'm not addressed that and just keep talking about Charlottesville was horrifying but a schizophrenic hit a lady with a car you know that's awful obviously but says corn syrup you know and it's like and to see empty but to see like Tina Fey and these people be like yeah they fight fascists like your grandparents fought the fascists and you're like what my grandparents weren't wearing black man oh you know you're the bad guy when you have to wear a mask when you have to wear masks that's always a given I used to a bit about that where it's like Franz was like a Franz why are we wearing skulls on our lapels you think we may be the bad guys was that you was that you bit I I stopped doing the bit cuz I realized a British guy done in the 80s oh but it was obscures it was cure but I'm such a I'm pretty pure with that stuff so I'm like I had to I had to bail on it even though it was awesome do you ever do you ever associate at all with left-wing comedians or liberal comedians yeah there are a lot of there women sometimes because I think leftism goes a lot better with being a woman because this is how you take care of a toddler and I'm dead serious they let goes with their nature where it's like no one's wrong everyone's safe like any threats bad like that's and men it's more about fairness and rules and work right where it's like if you break the rules you're out because then will gets trampled by an elephant you know it is true and men care about truth a lot more that you're actually telling the truth that like I think women women are like on another plane about them I'm telling you I used to do a bit but it's just some of my bits are just fat I don't even know if there are jokes anyone it's a matter capitalist and women are communists where it's like women like if they're out in a group the one having the worst time sets the tone for the whole group like five of them are having a blast and teen is like oh my god Brian's here with new girl and all the other girls are like we got to get out of here Tina's sad and then the worst dictates and men are the opposite where if one guys like I'm sad it's like get out of here but the opposite is true were like men reward greatness where it's like oh he's really smart let's give him a desk and a microphone it's awesome he's the fastest make him captain women are like she's the prettiest tell everybody she has herpes you know and it's like the tallest nail gets hammered down and I think it is a male/female thing and I think that's one reason why there's all this rhetoric against males especially white males because they always vote for smaller government so you're actually saying that women should not be allowed to vote I mean that's basically where we're going well they're if they want to do bucket work I don't know what was that called a bucket like back in the day like when women when it first happened a lot of women didn't want to vote this is funny I obviously think women should vote I mean I don't think you should actually go do it though cuz you make horrifying decisions but you get drafted if you voted and you also had to be part of like the anti Brigade like Judi yeah and all these women were like now we don't have vote it's all this dump games we had only listen if we would only listen to those women I know I do about it but I need a piano well so I'm out of time I'm unfortunate talk to you for everybody laughs really funny what what are you gonna do now I mean first of all are you ever going to get back on Twitter no no you're down I'm down there's more time in your day well well actually I have someone on do at Owen comedy and I never touch it so they can't cuz they know my IP address any time I even try I'm out really yeah and so I and let's just say she's from a country that isn't very intimidated well Israel and and so that but that's nothing you can find me at patreon.com slash WD TL because even if it's a dollar a month they won't shut it down cuz trolls don't pay ever like
