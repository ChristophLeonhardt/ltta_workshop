1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,190
It’s almost kind of like a blank canvas
with some,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,000
like some texture.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,680
I do see a white dot there but I don’t know
if that’s supposed to be there.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,300
It looks like something I would cook on,
like a baking sheet.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,200
Could be a lot of flies stuck to
a bit of paper.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,800
Yeah, ’cause I would put this down on my
floor,

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,840
my floor tiles.

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,000
These people are describing Robert Ryman’s
painting “Bridge.”

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,070
It sold for $20.6 million at a Christie’s
auction in 2015.

10
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,860
How is an all-white painting considered art,

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,620
and why would anyone shell out millions for
something like this?

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,040
There are a lot of these “white paintings.”

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,989
Many people trace them back to Kazimir Malevich’s
1918 work “White on White.”

14
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:38,920
But there are many artists who created these
kinds of paintings:

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,880
Most of these artists were associated with
an art movement

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,090
called minimalism, which emerged in the late
1950s.

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,590
When I say the minimalists I mean minimalism
with a capital M, not a lowercase.

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,010
This is Elisabeth Sherman, she’s an assistant
curator

19
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,730
at the Whitney Museum in New York.

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,310
It’s tempting to look at one of these paintings
and think that some jerk just took a tube

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,310
of white paint

22
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,310
and spread it on a canvas —

23
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,340
but it’s not actually that easy.

24
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,480
I mean mine rules, obviously, because I’m
a f****** genius, but

25
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,520
there’s usually a lot more than meets the
eye.

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,680
White isn't really a pure thing. White is
always tinted in some way.

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,430
Paint is made up of a variety of pigments.

28
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,320
If you've ever painted the walls of your house,
you know how many different whites there are

29
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
to choose from.

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,150
And maybe if you only look at one it looks
like pure white,

31
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,210
but when you hold them up in an array you
can see the subtle differences.

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,040
It's blue, it's green, it's purple, it's warm,
it's cold.

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,330
And when you get close—

34
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,260
HEY!

35
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,340
Not too close, there’s a lot going on here.

36
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,280
Lines, texture, patterns, even color.

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,540
There are a lot of subtle intricacies that
make it more

38
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,240
than “just a white canvas.”

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,440
Minimalist artists wanted their work to embody
order, simplicity, and harmony.

40
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,870
These artists began with these ideas as a
rejection

41
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,720
of abstract expressionism.

42
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,700
Abstract expressionism was a movement of artists
in the 1940s and 50s

43
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,579
who thought that art should be gestural, expressive,
and emotional,

44
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:06,549
evoking the unconscious mind through movement
and color.

45
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:10,219
So if we think about Jackson Pollock as being
kind of

46
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:13,139
the abstract expressionist that many people
think of,

47
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,689
you can take that picture of him with the
canvas

48
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:17,340
on the floor of his studio

49
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,379
spilling paints everywhere,

50
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,329
and it's his gesture, it's his physical body,
it's his arm, it's who he is as a person

51
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:27,879
that's creating that canvas, that painting.

52
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,120
Minimalists weren’t about that.

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,010
All that paint splashing everywhere?

54
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,299
No thanks.

55
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:39,249
There was a lot of desire to get away from
that sensibility

56
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:42,340
where the individual's expression was put
into the canvas.

57
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,599
The idea was that the art object — be it
sculpture or painting

58
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,279
or installation — should kind of

59
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:53,599
be as far removed from the author as possible.

60
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,360
You can see what she means when you compare
the two schools of art.

61
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,880
Okay, you get it.

62
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,080
Minimalist artists stripped art of the burden
of being about “something else.”

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,969
They presented art not as an imitation of
reality

64
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,960
but as an object unto itself.

65
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,420
Artist Frank Stella summed it up nicely when
he said,

66
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,440
One of my favorite things about modern art
is the rage that it seems to provoke in some

67
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,450
people.

68
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,870
Cue videos of men freaking out:

69
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,519
I’m not gonna sit there and try to find
a meaning

70
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,790
in a red circle on a blank white canvas,

71
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,659
’cause I’m not gonna find any meaning.

72
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:39,599
I may not understand art
but I do understand the English language,

73
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,249
and that's pretentious nonsense.

74
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:44,769
Did you see the painting that was just a white
painting

75
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:46,090
that had nothing on it?

76
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,729
It’s like super pretentious meets uber pretentious.

77
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,150
Modern art sets. people. off.

78
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,839
And believe me when I say that I am here for
it.

79
00:03:54,839 --> 00:04:00,200
But with modern art, by definition every interpretation
is genuine and legitimate and okay.

80
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,409
Or not, how about not?

81
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,560
I love it.

82
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,480
There’s even an entire play about a group
of lifelong friends

83
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,829
who are torn apart when one of them

84
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,790
buys an all-white painting for $200,000.

85
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:17,180
With a very kind of absent blank painting
you have to do a lot more work in some ways

86
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,199
than maybe you have to do with, let's say,
pop art

87
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,279
that has tons of obvious references

88
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,090
and you see the Coca-Cola or the American
flag

89
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,770
and you can say, I have all of these relationships

90
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,009
with these objects with these brands with
these things.

91
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:33,009
When you're looking at simply a square of
white paint,

92
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:34,479
you have to do a lot more work,

93
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,289
but sometimes there maybe is something more
rewarding in the end.

94
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:41,069
Another common reaction to modern art,

95
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,540
specifically minimalist pieces like white
paintings is,

96
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,320
c’mon, say it with me now,

97
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,860
Almost no matter what show I've worked on
in my career somebody has said that.

98
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,580
While there is a lot of skill in a lot of
modern and contemporary art

99
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,990
there's also a lot of art that is more about
the idea than it is about skill.

100
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,479
And so yes you could do it but you didn't.

101
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,780
Damn Elisabeth.

102
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,800
And that may sound obnoxious or flip

103
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,169
but the reality is is that once art begins
to live just as much

104
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,139
in the mind as it does in the eye

105
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:23,919
you have to bring your ideas
as well as your physical construction of the

106
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,919
work.

107
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,710
White paintings are a fascinating kind of
Rorschach test.

108
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,200
They offer viewers an ambiguous, I’m so
sorry, but, canvas

109
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,810
to project their own interpretations, emotions,
beliefs, and stories onto.

110
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,620
So if looking at a white painting makes you
feel

111
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,770
angry or excited or soothed, those are all
valid responses.

112
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,310
But take a moment to think about why that
was your response.

113
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:51,030
It's very easy to be dismissive of things
that we’re not immediately attracted to.

114
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:58,759
So if you have a kind of negative gut reaction,
one of defensiveness or fear or anxiety or

115
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,319
rejection

116
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,610
maybe try to move past that and see what's
available afterwards.

117
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,860
And it doesn't have to change your mind,

118
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,389
but it's sometimes the process of working
through

119
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,889
that reaction that you learn the most about
the work

120
00:06:11,889 --> 00:00:00,000
but also about yourself.
