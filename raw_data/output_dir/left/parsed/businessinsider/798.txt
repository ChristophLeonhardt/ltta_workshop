I do not agree that money can buy
happiness money can make things
convenient and can make yeah I guess
money can make certain things go more
easily and seamlessly but truthfully in
the end money complicates things more
you have more access which means more
choices which means more unnecessary
decisions and stress where I said to
somebody just yesterday I would rather
be completely flat broke for the next
four years than have to go through the
divorce that I just went through for the
next four years so I don't know fine
answer the question but money certainly
didn't buy me any happiness in the most
difficult time of my entire life
