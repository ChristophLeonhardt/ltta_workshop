nearly eight years after Kevin Smith was arrested on drug charges in New Orleans an appeals court found that he should be released and that the case was dismissed after prosecutors have violated his right to a speedy trial because he was arrested eight years prior but he wasn't convicted eight years prior he has never been convicted of anything he just spent all of that time in jail now that was last fall but even until right now there still has not been justice he's still in prison to this day and this is an incredible story that thankfully I saw Shaun King has been doing some digging on this communicating with the family of Kevin Smith and trying to get the word out about it to get something like justice because as it looks right now Kevin Smith might spend years more in jail for a crime he has never been convicted of but I want to walk you back through this story to see how justice has been so perverted in the case of Kevin Smith in February of 2010 police in the New Orleans neighborhood of Carrollton raided a home where they said a 43 year old man named Kevin Smith lived police claimed that they found small baggies of cocaine and a safe in the home according to Smith's attorney however Smith did not actually reside at that address which seems like the sort of thing that could be confirmed after eight years but perhaps not he was arrested on drug charges nonetheless because of a previous conviction the DA's office had the ability even though Smith was just facing a nonviolent drug charge to prosecute him under a repeat felony statute in the state that would lead up to up to 20 years in prison because he theoretically could have done some cocaine I did that by itself if that was the only thing here that would seem like a huge perversion of what should be justice and to cut this country but it goes worse than that Smith has never been convicted of a crime that he was arrested for for that cocaine Smith sat in jail for the rest of 2010 and all of 2011 he was locked up for all of 2012 because his defense requested continuances several times the court was closed due to Hurricane Isaac that fall then he was in jail for 2013 2014 and 2015 in 2014 he was offered a plea deal they'd let him go on time served if he would plead guilty he refused probably because he feels he didn't actually commit the crime that he'd already spent years in prison for and so he stayed for 2015-2016 all of 2017 until finally in November of 2017 the judge in Smith's case granted a defense motion to quash the indictment against him and so it sounded like finally there would be justice at that point but there has not been thankfully the family of Kevin Smith have reached out to Shaun King I believe on Instagram actually which is interesting it's the modern world we live in and said this good morning mr. King Kevin is still incarcerated he was released from Orleans Orleans Parish Prison however the parole board is holding him until March 4th 2022 the Orleans Parish District Attorney was very sore that he was not convicted so Kevin believes that he has something to do with him being held on the parole end he had been in jail since February of 2010 kevin is currently being held at the river correctional facility which is now for nothing a private prison with a profit motive to keep him in there as long as possible and the reason that they're holding him is because he didn't change an address or something it's some ridiculous clerical thing in Cali there is no justice associated with this story meaning there is no wrongdoing that has been proven that is associated with this story it is obscene on so many levels and then you're right at the end of it he shoved into a private prison which is clearly associated with profit but it's heartbreaking to see this year after year and the family of Kevin Smith is is begging for some kind of justice there can be no justice now this is a life stolen yeah again even if okay so the pleading the the the deal to plea guilty and then you get you get released for time served they already dragged him in there for some other previous crime that was on Mitchell what it was you mentioned it was probably pretty the cocaine yeah no that was like they didn't cry out you sure it's a prior for that so think about how that system works we're gonna drag you in because there's something prior that we had about you you say you plead guilty this now and you serve what not eight years or so seven years for now and so think about not when you're free you have this on your record because you pled guilty plead guilty then after you then say features they want to round you up again and you pled guilty something back in 2018 that you served all this time for what did you do then that doesn't get put in as an asterisk that he pled guilty so you can get out it was in his he pled guilty cuz he did that stuff yeah and now we get to continue to round you up you have this record you don't get a job you can't even make anything give yourself you're a pariah as a society all that is admitted that's another reason why you say no I'm not going to agree to you just rounding me up and continue to this so then they so then in response to that you take that as an insult as a prosecutor we've heard about the pride of prosecutors like no no we're not get this guy we're gonna find a way to continue to drag this through a legal system and keep him locked up until he understands we control him for no reason last thing I heard Michael Caputo who was part of the Trump campaign keeps complaining about Hayes all these legal fees he's on Tucker cross and show last night complaining about it because you know that's what people usually who have been dragged through the legal system have to do is go on Tucker cross and show and complain about it you know I had to raise a GoFundMe page my kids can't go to college we I told him they're gonna go to because I'm paying all these legal fees just because I was associated with a crime administration this guy's complaining on TV about it at this but while this man in Louisiana tell me his name again Kevin Smith is sitting in jail he's not on TV complain about how he's getting around to the legal system it has no money to pay for it but we're listening to guys like Marco Caputo and I can't say the words I want to say about him complain on TV every day about it but this is the the the miss our legal system providing one person with a voice and nothing for anyone else he's gonna be in prison till please what I do what are we gonna do about it and I know you're right and you're right there's that there's prosecutorial ego and aggression that is unchecked and continues to be sort of baked into the system you know the reason they want him to plead guilty for time served is cuz their numbers are helped by that right that's a check okay we've got we were able to get a confession and admission of guilt in that's in that case it's it's wrong and I'm so glad that jr. mentioned the ripple effect when it comes time to reconstitute your life right now you're out of prison after eight years how the hell are you going to restart your life it's hard enough you've been behind on everything from technology to your your family life yeah you have no group of friends you have no connections to help you begin any kind of professional relationships that might be able to begin to build an economic viability to your life after that you plead guilty to a felony yeah it just it makes it makes total sense that he would push back on that it could be that if he didn't plead guilty and then eventually they find that he was fine that he was held all these years for nothing maybe they have to pay him some money or something like that but if you can get him to plead guilty then you're probably absolved of anything like that quite a bit put clay on the paying money they also do that I have a guy on my podcast 23 years behind bars falsely convicted of murder he was exonerated through the Innocence Project and then the state of California has held up compensating him from more than 10 years he still doesn't have his money why is that because again that's prosecuted to court prosecutorial aggression and they want they don't want to write that check the state of California even knowing that he's innocent doesn't want to write that check it's I mean we forget worry we don't keep hearing that story yeah we heard oh he got he was awarded 1.5 million now not did he get it never hear the end of the half two easy ways folio interests want us hit the subscribe button down
