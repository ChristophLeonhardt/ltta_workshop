during his trip to Poland Donald Trump did try to reach out to polish leadership but it didn't really work out for him let's watch so this is leader Poland and they're not wrong his first lady I don't think so then the best of course she's actually following etiquette we'll explain in a second yeah the best is his look though okay that's the theoretical snub and then look at the look look at the look yeah yeah yeah I know how these women are I know yeah that's the life of the President she's supposed to shake the first lady's hand first and then the president's hand but of course our president is our commander is schmuck didn't get briefed on any of that ik it when they probably try to brief him on that agrees I go dudes etiquette but got it I got it four things I was robbing other hands huh and yeah so I like she's not she's not being rude or whatever she's just shaking and the whole thing doesn't matter obviously but his look was just he's so mad and what I think it actually is this partially it's not knowing the etiquette but it's partially that I don't think he even considered the possibility that she would want to interact in any way with his wife first he forgets that his wife is there constantly but you remember at the inauguration they did the comparison video where Obama gets out of the car waits for Michelle they walk up together but him he just gets out and walks up there and Melania is just standing in the background he doesn't even remember that she's there to be fair to him she won't even hold his hands that's true he doesn't have a lot of luck with the handshakes recently look at the eyes man you know so Poland has been great to Trump and look and then look at the look at look at the look and that little smirk like I'll get you right there little arm right so and it to be pretty Trump to be fair to Trump well we'll see if there's a baby case remember other foreign leaders have refused to shake his hand because he started that nonsense he's such a weirdo when he because he did it with Merkel like he wouldn't shake her hand and then and then he would try to shake people's other's other people's hands even more forcefully so that it became a game so when she did that he probably thought oh here we go again right they're trying to slow me right so look he apparently demanded that there be cheering crowds in Poland for him and they said don't worry we'll have that for you well that's so sad that's so sad okay but now that he feels he got snubbed and you think he's gonna listen to anybody who tells him about etiquette afterwards listen anybody and you know how fragile his ego is cuz he's a sensitive little child you know so god help poland god help her we don't know what he's in a tweet about her soon yeah oh boy i don't even want to think about it help us build independent media become a member of the young turks TYT Network comm slash join
