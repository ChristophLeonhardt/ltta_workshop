so kendrick lamar who is apparently a rapper of some sort demonstrating my full knowledge of the pop cultural range I believe he's a rapper so Kendrick Lamar had he was doing a concert and he invited a fan onstage to sing and then he asked the fan who's a white woman to sing the lyrics of his song mad city which is maad city which is now he's gone mad but sure okay and then she one of the lyrics in here uses the n-word okay here's the video of what it looked like do the rules a little bit it's really cool yet to work you gotta greet one single word though oh I'm sorry Joey yeah you did also sir Oh should she say okay okay I mean just what the hell is wrong with this guy like he knows what the lyrics to his own song are that is not her fault I'm sorry that is not the fault for the white lady who gets up there it's not like he said to her beforehand you know go easy on the lyrics to my song you wrote them there dude you don't want somebody actually reading the lyrics of your song or doing the lyrics to your song don't write the lyrics in there or ask the lady up if you've got a problem with white lady rapping your song as you wrote it then maybe you should have invited a black lady up there to wrap your song in Reuters you've got plenty of black fans there it's just it's absurd okay and I think people caught on to it so a lot of folks on on Twitter were like this is just a setup right the day they brought a fan up to sing and then flipped when she said the n-word and he knew what he was doing this woman's life is gonna be ruined on social media now she's gonna be claimed to be a racist when she just wanted to go to a concert and sing presumably with someone she was a fan of it's it's just it's just ridiculous Lamar was evidently under the impression that Delaney would sense her skip and sense herself and skip the racial epithet epithet in the song but she clearly did not get the memo and then sent Delaney who is that this this woman who was called out of the crowd should man's down where're you from n-word F who you know where you from my n-word what your grandma say huh my n-word okay so it's not like this appears one time in the song if there's one thousand times in the song like what she's supposed to do okay get up here and sing the song and she goes we literally this is what it would say I'm like man town where are you from F who you know where are you from where your grandma stay huh Mike okay like you wrote the lyric dude this is your own fault you don't want people using the n-word then don't use the n-word don't use the n-word in your song okay I understand that there are distinctions between black people using the n-word and white people using the n-word that there's a whole attempt by certain members of the black community to co-op's the term n-word and then use it as a way of empowerment I think this is fully stupid okay I think it's stupid I'm just gonna be honest with this there are there lots of slurs that are used against Jews all the time okay and you've heard me try to co-opt Jewish jokes okay but you've never heard me tried to co-opt the K word right there's a K word that has been used against Jews for many many many many decades hey Jews don't call each other my bleep and they don't call each other that because why would you want to promulgate the word if the word is bad the word is bad especially to avoid situations like this because it sets up this ridiculous double standard I don't think it is worthwhile to have that lyric in the song but if you are gonna have that lyric in the song you can't be surprised when people sing your song the whole point of you singing the song is that others will sing your song oh Kendrick Lamar
