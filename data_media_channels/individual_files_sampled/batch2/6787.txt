the big question as to whether or not dr. Christine Blasi Ford will testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday remains unanswered and there is a back-and-forth currently taking place between senators chuck Grassley other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and lawyers representing dr. Blasi and so first let's begin with the update indicating that there is a deadline for dr. Blasi and that was determined by Senator Chuck Grassley so senator Grassley said 10:00 a.m. Friday as the deadline for Christine Blasi Ford's legal team to respond to his request for her to speak to the committee that's not Friday of next week that's Friday of this week meaning tomorrow by 10:00 a.m. yeah that's absurd yeah and it does it means something but it it means that we're really gonna go on without you on Monday that part I believe and that is very important it'll be the crux of what we discuss in a minute does she really have to meet it by 10 o'clock on Friday of course not if she said by 11:30 in the morning if she's like all right fine I'll testify will be no sorry you missed the deadline both sides are trying to be tough guys when there's an issue you know I think one side is trying to be tough guys one side that's trying as hard as possible to push a confirmation through at any and all cost but we'll get to that in just a minute so by the way Grassley is also calling for the unredacted version of the letter that Ford had sent to Feinstein about the alleged incident I think that's fine I have no problem with that whatsoever now the response from Flossie's legal team they have indicated that she would be willing to testify next week so long as senators offer quote terms that are fair and which ensure her safety that's according to an email that the lawmaker sent to committee staff members but they also included the following message Ford continues to believe that a full nonpartisan investigation of this matter is needed and she is willing to cooperate with the committee however the committee stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding so there there was another person named in these accusations another person who allegedly witnessed this according to doctor Aziz recollection of the alleged assault and that was Mark judge and so I think it makes sense for Mark's judge to testify as well and and if he wants to deny it okay but do it under oath one other thing look if you stand by Kavanaugh and you do not believe doctor bla C's allegations wouldn't you want the FBI to get involved again this wouldn't be a criminal investigation this would be an investigation to look into the allegations and see if you can get to the bottom of the truth but they don't want to do that which i think is just fascinating so I think there are three different things that are factors here and and different actors in the play so there's the Republican Party Democratic Party and then dr. Blasi so the Republican Party wants this to be resolved as soon as possible with as little stain on Cavanaugh as possible as you're gonna see in a little bit grass these staffers have already said oh yeah we know he's the right guy and he's the one telling the truth then why do you need the hearings okay so you apparently made up your mind already and of course of course they're playing politics and of course they want Kevyn Orr to get confirmed and and and if they're worried it if there's a delay it will go past the election in which case Democrats might regain control of Senate the Democrats are also playing politics and the Democrats want to delay it's true and an FBI investigation would delay it longer now dr. Blasi the person infected here her interests are in a fair hearing so she's saying look why don't you do a nonpartisan investigation and the FBI is not partisan and it's a background check they've done one on Cavanaugh before they've done one on every one of these Supreme Court justices and have done new checks when new information came out as they did with Clarence Thomas and then ADA Hill controversy so and I'm asking you to have hearings where we hear from other witnesses and you might have more witnesses if you allow the FBI the investigator Chuck Grassley turns around and says I don't know that the FBI quote does not make a credibility assessment of any information it receives with respect to a nominee no no which is a lie know what it's a it's a half a lie yes the FBI does not do the credibility assessment the Senate does but the FBI collects the information for you to be able to do the credibility assessment so grass is either saying the FBI's never involved in this process which would be to Anna's point a total lie or he's saying the FBI's normally involved but I don't want them involved in this case because I don't want new information to assess look my point in in in arguing that he's lying is that he's trying to make it seem as though it's unusual for the FBI to get involved in this process when it is not unusual at all at all that is exactly what happened in the Anita Hill hearings and so they don't want to get to the bottom of the truth they don't want to know they don't want to add Mark judge to this hearing they don't want to hear his testimony they don't want any of it they don't want any part because for them it is purely political and yes do Democrats have a political motive sure right but I don't care about what the intentions are what I care about is what they're calling for and what they're calling for is beyond reasonable we're not talking about you know a temporary position for someone we're talking about a lifetime appointment as a Supreme Court justice and so we need to do our due diligence the Senate should want to do its due diligence and make sure that they're confirming the right person for that job and that that's not what they want to do and so the politicians hypocrisy is of course as usual maddening so the same mitch mcconnell's and Chuck Grassley who said that we should wait 14 months and not have a single hearing on Merrick garland to become the Supreme Court justice now turn around and go no we have to do immediately times of the essence how could they possibly delay this is an outrage I mean come on guys even if you're a Republican you have to say well they're obviously full of crap I mean they don't think time is of the essence otherwise they wouldn't awaited 14 months on Merrick garland that's so they're playing politics period period period now if dr. blah sees interests diverge from the Democrats she shouldn't give a damn what the Democrats think that's their job is to play politics on the other side okay so but right now she wants a fair hearing the Democrats want a longer hearing they happen to be aligned on that they don't have to be aligned right and if they're Democrats thought they could delay by having it some investigation that doctor was he didn't watch she could say no I don't want that yeah and sorry to interrupt you jank but I want to be clear with the audience about how I would personally react if the shoe was on the other foot because I think that's important because for me this isn't political for me this is about getting to the heart of the truth right if the shoe were on the other foot we're still in the Obama administration he nominates someone and let's say a right-leaning accuser comes out and accuses a Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault right and that accuser calls for the FBI to get involved damn right I want the FBI involved yeah cuz I want to get to the heart of the truth right but that is not what they want yeah so and so that's where we are today so but the now they're super important question is will she go to testify on Monday because if she doesn't they're now saying that they will probably cancel the hearings altogether so I think she should go we've had this debate or discussion before I don't know where you stand on it today Anna but I think that from a there's a couple of different perspectives here I think the Republicans have now circled the wagons and will get to say hey listen we gave her a shot and she just wouldn't come and that'll probably play okay in terms of politics okay so but then when you turn to the actual substance of the issue so how does that play out for dr. Blasi who's the potential victim here well then she never gets to tell her side of the story and a Kavanagh gets confirmed and we're done with it well I don't want that not that count on not being former I don't want him confirmed for other reasons I he's Pro corruption I'd go on and on right but I want her side of the story told and I don't want this to get railroaded and it looks like the Republicans are gonna do that they feel like they've protected their PR flank enough that if she doesn't come they are gonna plow forward so I don't think they should I if they are unwilling to allow the FBI to look into this I do not think she should testify and let me be clear about why okay because under these conditions when she does testify they will smear her okay you will have a group of middle-aged to elderly men okay asking her all sorts of humiliating questions very similar to what happened to Anita Hill maybe worse and I'm gonna give you an example of something that proves my point they've made up their minds they don't care about her testimony okay and should give you some evidence of that let's go to graphic seven so there's Mike Davis who had recently tweeted something and then deleted it he's the committee's chief staffer for nominations and he tweeted twice overnight about his key role in the committee's review of Christine Blasi Ford's allegation as well as criticism of Ford's attorneys and his desired outcome of the process so here's what he had tweeted and then later deleted unfazed and determined we will confirm judge Cavanaugh hashtag confirmed Cavanaugh hashtag SCOTUS he also wrote I personally questioned judge Cavanaugh under penalty of felony and five years of imprisonment if he lies I'm still waiting to hear back from the accusers attorneys who can't find time between TV appearances to get back to me look he's made up his mind they have made up their mind so okay so she's gonna go and testify for what for what so they can tell you for in front of everyone and make her out to be the bad guy because she came forward these allegations so look I'll make the case against that and then I'll help your case a little bit in some factors but I want everybody to know you guys can participate in this too we brought the polls back because this is such an important question and I as always genuinely care well what you guys think about this I'm curious what you guys think about this so it's t y-t-dot-com such poll should Christine Blasi testify in the cabin our hearings on Monday so yes or no we'll have those options for you it's very easy to RT diagram slash poll love the link down below in the description box for your watching later on YouTube or Facebook okay so Anna I know that they I'm not naive it's not like the Republic's like hmm grass is like gee I I don't know which way I'm gonna go with this this is the guy I wanted on the Supreme Court for a long time and I'm you know anti-choice and I want him I think he's gonna overturn Roe vs. Wade but oh I care deeply about some sexual assault allegations we didn't care when Trump didn't care where Roy Moore did it etc etc so of course they've made up their minds but there are a couple of important senators that are still can be swayed and they will decide whether this goes forward or not so there's Susan cause Lisa Murkowski or Republicans who claim that they're pro-choice and that they are Pro women's rights Jeff Flake a little bit bob Corker a tiny bit could be in play in terms of those senators now flake and corker are retiring and they don't like Trump so that gives you a tiny percentage chance that if they that they're genuinely listening and if they have a good enough reason to believe her that they might vote against Kavanagh calls and Murkowski might lose their seats if they vote again if they vote for Kavanagh after hearing compelling testimony from dr. Blasi so it's not I'm not thinking oh my god it Mitch McConnell might change his mind of course I Ted Cruz might change his mind of course not but there are but it depends the testimony and yes will they attack her some of them will attack her probably viciously yes but that also it doesn't mean that they will win on those counts the country will get to see it and when the country sees it the people who are already hate you know the idea that women can protect themselves and should have this equal rights etc will be like yeah we knew it she was had a good time at a party somewhere else many years later it's her fault she had it coming right yes there are people already saying that and there are people on the Left who are decent people who won't see that way at all and there are people in the middle like some Kansas moms that are out there who voted for Republicans in the past that'll see it and go I relate to that I think she was honest and what why are they attacking her like that and that'll piss them off well and look that is one way that it could play out that the only reason I give you all those options is because that it is not a foregone conclusion it's you know what I'm saying so Collins uh appears to be look she's not strongly supporting Kavanagh but based on the comments I've seen from Collins she seems more supportive than not she talks about you know speaking to Kavanagh one-on-one and saying that the conversation was excellent and so I don't know if if any testimony is going to convince her so but you do make a compelling case I don't know if I even really trust flake and corker but we'll see right I just worry because if she agrees to do this on their terms meaning the Republicans in the Senate Judiciary Committee if she does it on their terms they know what they're doing they've already made up their mind they're gonna smear her and I'm worried that they'll smear her so effectively that it won't even matter that she's testifying in the very people that you're hoping she'll swing or you know convince will remain supportive of Kavanagh that's what I'm concerned about and so nothing will get accomplished and you know they'll keep attacking her they'll keep smearing her and I think it makes all the sense in the world to just do the investigation and the fact but they're not gonna do it that's a fact and that's the thing I'm so tired of constantly just accepting that like these guys are terrible people and they don't want to do the investigation because it's all political for them so all right we got to accept it now we got to decide now the balls in her court I know I know we're in a tough spot like what else do you do but I'm just sick of caving to that so the two points that I'll make on your side is it's easy for us to say she should do it but we're not her look that she already had to go into hiding and the attacks against her will be not only vicious and over-the-top but potentially perpetual we've barely seen her face now but then everybody after these hearings she'll be one of the most famous people in the country and there will be a percentage of the right-wing that will despise her and say at a bare minimum say terrible things about her and look there that's how her attack her family there's still remember the thing that haunts me is the the lunatics who believed in Alex Jones is Sandy Hook conspiracy they made some of those family members the positives that are now suing him they lost their six-year-old kid in that tragedy and they've had to move seven times because lunatic right-wingers keep harassing them as threatening them threatening their lives so that's what she's got to look forward to for the rest of her life and somehow people think she did this what for her own advantage are you insane okay so it's easy for me to say she should do it but it is a hell of a personal toll that it is gonna take and and and then the other thing is look there the other side also gets to participate the Democrats could defend her on the other hand Democrat oh yeah yeah Democrats have a great track record of being strong and defending people and doing the right thing I mean that's the thing right if like if I was a Democratic senator on that committee here because of the Democrats like let's just be like honest about we're here because of the Democrats okay I don't know how Republicans would have done it but I guarantee you that if they were in Obama shoes and they had the ability to nominate someone with 14 months left to the election they would have done something I don't know what trick they would pull out of their back pocket super he would have been gotten it done they they would have done what they did with a corsage they would have just killed the filibuster immediately we're done with it and now we have the seat what are you gonna do about it it took like a second for them to do that cut Democrats are such suckers and on purpose we talked about it before so if there was a strong progressive on that committee they'd say not on my watch and you know and they'd counter-attack and they would defend but these are the Democrats so you will get a tepid defense very likely and so you're going into a lines I acknowledge all the Santa you're going into a lines then and and you've got these weak sauce senators or on your theoretically kind of I say on your side but not really they're on their side right and so they have a different agenda that she does so that's another factor but all that being said this is your only chance to tell the story and this is the chance to make a difference and so if it happened you got to go tell the truth there you got to tell people what happened so that we don't have a lifetime appointment go in the
