>> Shannon: THE WHITE HOUSE
IMPOSING NEW TARIFFS AIMED AT
CHINA AS ECONOMIC TENSION RISE
23 THE TWO NATIONS.
CHINA VOWING TO MATCH THEM.
IT'S SET TO GO INTO EFFECT
JULY 6th ON THE LIST, 1,100
PRODUCTS MOSTLY USED IN
MACHINERY AS THE WHITE HOUSE
REVIEWS A SECOND LIST OF
PRODUCTS FOR NEW TARIFFS.
PRESIDENT WEIGHED IN EARLIER ON
A POSSIBLE TRADE WAR.
>> THERE IS NO TRADE WAR.
THEY'VE TAKEN SO MUCH.
LAST YEAR, $375 MILLION IN TRADE
DEFICIT CHINA.
WE HAD OVERALL OVER $800 BILLION
OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS.
EACH YEAR, CLOSE TO $800 BILLION
IN LOSSES ON TRADE.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
ANYMORE.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
IT CAN'T HAPPEN.
>> Shannon: I'M JOINED NOW BY
MICHAEL ALLEN OF BEACON GLOBAL
STRATEGIES AND FORMER MEMBER OF
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL.
GREAT TO HAVE WITH YOU US TODAY.
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> Shannon: OK.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?
CHINA SAID, LISTEN, WHATEVER YOU
GIVE US IS COMING BACK TO YOU.
THEY'LL RETALIATE.
THEY HAVE SAID THIS PRESIDENT IS
DAMAGING AND UNDERMINING THE
WORLD GLOBAL TRADE SITUATION AS
IT IS.
THIS GUY IS A DISRUPTOR.
HE TOLD US IN THE CAMPAIGN THIS
IS WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO.
>> HE TOLD US HE WAS GOING DO
THIS.
THE CHINA HAS A PLAN TO TAKE
OVER THE UNITED STATES IN
MILITARY CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY.
WE ALL AGREE THIS IS A BIG
PROBLEM.
THE UNITED STATES OTHERS THAT DO
SOMETHING.
TRUMP'S FORMULATION TO GET
LEVERAGE OVER THE CHINESE IS TO
DO MORE TARIFFS.
WE CAN TRY SOMETHING ELSE BUT
THIS IS THE WAY THAT THE
PRESIDENT IS GOING AFTER IT, AND
SO HE HOPES TO GET SOME LEVEL
OVER THEM SO WE MIGHT HAVE REAL
NEGOTIATIONS LATER.
>> Shannon: OK, THERE ARE REAL
PEOPLE AT THE END OF THIS NOW
CHINA SAYS WE'RE GOING TO GO
AFTER THE PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOU,
THE HEARTLAND, THE FARMERS, THE
MIDWEST.
IT'S GOING TO HURT SOMEONE IN
THE LONG RUN.
WE HAVE MONMOUTH POLL.
THEY ASKED ABOUT HOW DO YOU
THINK THE TARIFFS WOULD IMPACT
THE U.S. ECONOMY.
25% SAID THINK IT'LL HELP.
40% SAID THEY THINK IT'LL HURT
US.
>> I THINK PUTTING TARIFFS ON
SOYBEANS AND FARMERS IN THE
MIDWEST MAY CAUSE US JOBS IN THE
LONG RUN.
PRESIDENT BUSH TRIED TARIFFS
EARLY ON.
THE REPORTS CAME OUT LATER THAT
YOU ENDED UP COSTING MORE JOBS
THAN YOU SAVED IN THIS INSTANCE.
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.
THE PRESIDENT OTHERS THAT PLAY
IT RIGHT.
HE DOES HAVE THE CUSHION OF AN
AMAZINGLY STRONG ECONOMY WHICH
PROBABLY GIVES HIM A LITTLE BIT
MORE CONFIDENCE TO TRY THIS,
BUT, YEAH, HE'S GOT TO WATCH IT
HERE.
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THIS POSSIBLE MEETING NOW
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND
VLADIMIR PUTIN.
HERE IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WILL MEET
THIS SUMMER.
>> ARE YOU PLANNING TO MEET WITH
PUTIN THIS SUMMER?
>> IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE'LL
MEET, YEAH.
I THOUGHT YOU KNOW, THIS ALL
STARTED BECAUSE SOMEONE, ONE OF
YOU, ASKED SOME PUTIN BE IN THE
G7?
I SAID, NO, SHOULD BE IN THE G8.
A FEW YEARS AGO, PUTIN WAS
CALLED IN WHAT WAS CALLED THE
G8.
I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE
RUSSIA IN THAN TO HAVE RUSSIA
OUT.
JUST LIKE NORTH KOREA, JUST LIKE
SOMEBODY ELSE, IT'S MUCH BETTER
IF WE GET ALONG WITH THEM THAN
IF WEDON.
>> Shannon: MY IN -- THAN IF
WE DON'T.
>> Shannon: MY UNDERSTANDING
IS RUSSIA IS INTERTWINED WITH US
ON EVERYTHING ELSE.
IF THEY'RE NOT AT THE TABLE,
WHAT GOOD ARE THE DISCUSSIONS?
THAT SEEMED TO ME TO MY
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT HE WAS
SAYING THERE?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> I THINK SO.
HE KNOWS ABOUT SYRIA AND
UKRAINE.
HE'S MAKING THE CALCULATIONS,
LIKE YOU SAID, BETTER TO HAVE
HIM AT THE TABLE.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE ALL THERE
YET BECAUSE OF THE RUSSIAN
BEHAVIOR ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
THEY ARE TRYING TO THWART THE
UNITED STATES EVERYWHERE WE GO,
BUT I GET IT.
HE'S THE PRESIDENT.
HE'S GOT TO MAINTAIN THE BIG
PICTURE IN MIND.
HE'S TRYING TO SALVAGE SOME SORT
OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA,
EVEN AS THE CONGRESS AND OTHERS
ARE AGGRESSIVELY GOING AFTER
HIM.
>> Shannon: WHEN YOU LOOK BACK
ON THINGS INCLUDE CRIMEA AND
UKRAINE, THERE ARE SERIOUS
ISSUES.
AS YOU SAID, IT'S BASICALLY A
PROXY WAR WHEN IT COMES TO SYRIA
AND A LOT OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN
THE MIDDLE EAST.
THE PRESIDENT SAID, YEAH, I MAY
SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH THIS GUY
BUT THE U.S. HAS BEEN TOUGH.
THE SANCTION THAT HAS ARE
LEVIED.
-- SANKS THAT ARE LEVIED.
OTHER THINGS THAT GO ON THAT
AREN'T IN THE MEDIA EVERY DAY
BUT IT'S A SCHIZOPHRENIC
RELATIONSHIP?
>> YES, PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT ON
RUSSIANS, DEFINITELY MORE THAN
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT SEEMS LIKE
HE'S READY TO MEET, HE SENDS THE
CONFLICTING MESSAGES, AS YOU
SAY.
SOME GETS TRAMPLED OVER.
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M READY TO LET
THEM BACK IN THE G7.
I GET WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO HE
WANTS TO MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP
