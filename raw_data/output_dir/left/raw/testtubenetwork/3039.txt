00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,111
Republican candidate Ted Cruz beat out Donald
Trump in Colorado for the 2016 Republican

2
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:09,111
nomination.

3
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:13,830
But while Cruz’s victory seemed clear, Trump
blasted the delegate results on Twitter, saying,

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,740
“the people of the great State of Colorado
never got to vote in the Republican Primary.”

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,440
In fact, although it is rare, Trump was absolutely
right.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,360
Republicans of Colorado did not collectively
vote for Ted Cruz, yet he won every available

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,360
delegate.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,810
So, how exactly did Ted Cruz win in Colorado
without any votes?

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,220
Well, the way Republican nominees are usually
chosen is that the Republican party of each

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:42,650
state holds a caucus, primary, or some other
venue for citizens to collectively vote.

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,501
Then, delegates vote in the national convention
in July, voting according to how their state

12
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:48,501
population voted.

13
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:50,940
There, delegates are considered “bound”
to representing their state’s preference,

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,980
and about 95% of Republican delegates are
bound.

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,110
In fact, the GOP made this representation
mandatory after the 2012 election.

16
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,040
That sounds pretty democratic, and similar
to how the electoral college works.

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,970
But to the Colorado GOP, this didn’t sound
great at all, especially as Donald Trump was

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,580
rising in the polls.

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,970
So to avoid allowing Colorado citizens the
option of voting for their candidate of choice,

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,310
the Colorado GOP cancelled the public vote
back in August of 2015.

21
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,800
Instead delegates were selected through a
series of local caucuses, ultimately awarding

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,310
Ted Cruz all of the state’s available delegates.

23
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,799
And Colorado isn’t the only state to do
this.

24
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,979
Similarly, North Dakota’s 25 delegates were
selected by party insiders, and the state

25
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,390
did not hold a public vote for the nomination.

26
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,290
Additionally, Wyoming and three US territories
also neglected to hold a public vote.

27
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,460
Trump and his supporters have loudly protested
what they view as a lack of representation.

28
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,720
One Trump fan in Colorado even set his Republican
registration on fire on YouTube, saying he

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,090
was quitting the Republican party.

30
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,920
So how can the Colorado GOP just ignore their
voters?

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,080
Well, this entirely stems from the fact that
both the Republican and Democratic National

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,729
Committees are private organizations.

33
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,720
Although they mimic democratic representation,
political parties can choose whomever they

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,060
want as a nominee, and don’t have to follow
the popular vote or even hold one.

35
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,640
Another tool the GOP has to stop Trump, besides
simply cancelling the popular vote, is to

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,810
force a brokered convention during the nomination.

37
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,150
If you’re curious to know what that is,
or how it can stop Trump, watch the video
