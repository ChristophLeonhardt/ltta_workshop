1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,430
right so i'm in la at VidCon and as some

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,830
of you saw my tweets yesterday I wasn't

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,150
having the greatest time ever it was

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,820
because well I had a bit to drink and

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,920
been at VidCon I was quite cynical with

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,020
the fact that it was very business based

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,029
I would have liked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

8
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,400
admit because I felt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this</font>

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,730
whole community movement thing if I've

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,070
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to help the world</font>

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,630
spread you know love and hope and

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,980
inspiration and vidcom actually was the

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,710
first one I thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that's an</font>

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,690
era coming to an end it was sort of an a

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,309
vision which<font color="#CCCCCC"> would have been nice and</font>

16
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,489
unfortunately commercialism and fame is

17
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,399
what is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important to people but</font>

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,430
I've met some great people and I've had

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,680
some great conversations today a friend

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,329
of mine called Andrew and Emerson and

21
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,989
here my friends like Jordan just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

22
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,520
quick explanation of what your cause is

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,609
about yeah sure yeah I am from Canada

24
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,709
and I my organization or associations

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,570
called compassion<font color="#CCCCCC"> peas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> org and we are</font>

26
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,240
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to again inspire people to to</font>

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,729
encourage each other and share your

28
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">share your your stories and your writing</font>

29
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,500
and your thoughts and your feelings in a

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,840
non-judgmental environment that and yeah

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,030
it's really trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it really</font>

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,560
opened up and expose people for who they

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,590
are but not not<font color="#CCCCCC"> having the world like</font>

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,050
condemn it or distort it in any way

35
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,790
keeping it very pure and allowing people

36
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,800
to be sharing that love and that pure

37
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,280
essence in a I guess you know yeah I

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,110
guess it's just that that pure

39
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,990
inspiration is what we're looking for

40
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,190
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to find these days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

41
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,720
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so blessed that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the way</font>

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,520
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Canada to to meet miles because</font>

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,290
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching his videos and I have</font>

44
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,590
been inspired<font color="#E5E5E5"> by him as well and it just</font>

45
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">shows that there are people out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

46
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,170
really showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that there are people</font>

47
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,760
out there working to try make a

48
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,170
difference and if we can all work

49
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,030
together I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like the</font>

50
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,470
difference is already there you know I

51
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,900
mean and I love this guy like I think

52
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,300
he's a fantastic person and and as I've

53
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,470
always said like inspiration is a

54
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,320
two-way system like when someone like

55
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,990
Jesus you've been inspired yeah it makes

56
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,580
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel better to keep doing what I'm</font>

57
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,740
doing and dice<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus everything exactly</font>

58
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,750
and it's a multiplier effect and it can

59
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">only get better and as I said in my last</font>

60
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,070
video guys about VidCon about what makes

61
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">me feel good to be alive it's talking</font>

62
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,920
with respectful people who do have

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,750
common goals and being out there in the

64
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,590
open and look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> view they're just</font>

65
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,690
unbelievable really and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to</font>

66
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,040

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,970
past year i felt quite lost in life I

69
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,390

70
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,190
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I could change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

71
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,840
