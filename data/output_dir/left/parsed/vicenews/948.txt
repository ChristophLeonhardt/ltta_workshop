— Oh!
More music!
— Uh, initial thoughts is, “Tone it, tone it, tone it...”
“Feels good, yeah!”
That's all I heard the whole time.
It sounded like somebody's voice
is pitched up a little bit,
Oh, that was a girl?
— Yeah.
Damn.
Sounds like someone needs
to take some more estrogen.
A lot of testosterone in that voice.
Sounds good, though.
I like the little "Build you up..."
that was kind of cool, but...
All I heard was, "Tone it, tone it, tone it."
Um... was that Kyle?
I couldn't tell, at first I thought it was Wiz Khalifa though.
And then it was, like, from the town
of Bruce Lee and somebody else,
and I was like, "Well, Bruce Lee ain't from Pittsburgh..."
so that's what kind of gave it away, but...
Next!
I don't know who that is,
but at first I thought it was like...
something from, like,
the hidden beach compilation thing,
the kind of music, like,
they remake music in a jazzy fashion.
His voice was great.
His voice was good, it had a soulful voice.
— This is Dennis Graham,
a.k.a. Drake's dad.
— Word?
A soul singer.
That's Drake's daddy, man.
Salute Dennis Graham, man.
"It was cold outside..."
So it's country trap music?
That shit worked, though.
That shit worked.
"No swimsuit, but I'm gonna jump in..."
Trap should've taken over the world, man.
In a minute, y'all motherfuckers are gonna be, "Trap!"
Goddamn.
Well, this concludes our music meeting for today.
Everybody can go home now.
Shit.
