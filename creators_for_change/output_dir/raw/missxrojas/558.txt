ridiculously busy person during term

to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video it's all good because</font>

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,450
it's because I've continued to be

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,280
enjoying school and I just thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,360
to show you something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font>

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,100
months but I finally caved the<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

have spent the money in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> purse the</font>

12
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,779
money my purse<font color="#CCCCCC"> was intended for some</font>

13
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,970
books about the SATs which I've ordered

14
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,340

16
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,439

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,910
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> process is really scary because I</font>

18
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,260
could have to learn stuff about biology

19
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,030
because the test<font color="#E5E5E5"> centers only offered a</font>

20
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,489
certain number of exams and like I don't

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and go back to reasoning which was the</font>

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,200
kind of things that got me into this

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,879

way that he repeats himself over and

86
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,270

time of books are still being senses and

114
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,920
where you know freedom of expression is

115
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,090
limited and should it be limited

116
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,590
obviously during like war times it

117
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,640
should be limited if it should it be

118
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,260
limited in sense that it can really

119
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,240
cause people harm especially being in
