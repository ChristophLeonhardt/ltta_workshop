remove well grey 3-yard girl cause it's
make your deals because steps I call it
women's wear is a series of videos that
we just try to square a bunch of things
so we can get cereal we can get the real
you don't have rich recipes we find
something too so we have to find a bunch
of ingredients and see if it's square
that it turns out great so no salt we're
gonna try to make rice krispies treats
with Doritos instead of rice krispies
treats and I don't know if this is going
to work so do you have instructions for
rice krispies treats yes okay so you
should probably like pick the camera off
and just like the reason so of course
these videos and I have here some jive
marshmallows it'll be faster okay so we
need a saucepan you know how to do you
know how to make this yes step 1 now
butter in a large saucepan so we're
gonna get okay we need this pot oh yeah
okay better rule
first thing never going to do if you
always need adult supervision even
though I can do by myself
yes you're still cup at low heat here
you just go to that occasion so sake
our first not Marshall oh wait yes okay
we need a quarter cup of butter okay and
4 cups of miniature marshmallows we got
big one OOP
you got to keep everybody busy while I'm
doing the butter sell them a joke tell
them a joke didn't know what did you
know any big joke oh thank goodness
adults are around to do it right my hand
is shaking because I don't lift the
house on fire with the butter roll all
right third you gotta make sure that
before you in court into the tray where
you Doritos are you have to make sure
the consistency is very runny and
liquidy play still Gannett nothing to be
like the runny butter it's going to be
sticky so because it's marshmallow I
think it's gonna be like yo get chunks
of marshmallow here in there why is your
cloning gene any chunky so chunky chunky
ball how's it going master chef
pretty good it's looking good look I'm
bein white chunks here in there but
looking good there you don't want to
pour tips in the things that are just so
like crunches ft-1 walking daikon
cheering oh yeah you want them to be
Quincy all right

again okay we've been stirring this for
both 1 5 10 minutes again how the point
is we want to see if we can make the
Reid own squares I think this is like a
first ever Dorito squared I think I've
ever seen anybody make Doritos squares

done this before can you get the butter

nachos
Oh gross we need to butter the butter
the bowl I'm not what is ready at monkey
