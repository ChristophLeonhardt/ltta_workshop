thousands of people in Yemen have lined the Capitol streets in protest against the saudi-led blockade of their country last week Riyadh introduced a full blockade on Yemen closing all access by air and sea the saudi-led coalition entered the civil war in 2015 supporting the ousted government against Houthi rebels its blockades have left millions starving and has led to what's been called the deadliest outbreak of cholera in recent history however after pressure from the United Nations and human rights groups the Saudis claimed on Monday that it would roll back the blockade to a partial one again however Human Rights Watch says that claim is a form of cruel fiction explaining that the port's that riad will reopen aren't enough to provide essential supplies of food and medicines Saudi Arabia says it will continue with its partial blockade until it's convinced there's no flow of weapons from Iran going to the Houthi rebels the civil war in Yemen is being seen in the Middle East by proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran next Arty's Jacqueline fuga looks at whether the current cold war between the region's most powerful countries could lead to a full-scale conflict the rivalry between Middle East powerhouses Saudi Arabia in Iran is nothing new yet it's becoming evermore tense with fears growing of a full-blown war a missile launch by Yemeni rebels directed at Riyadh earlier this month has already got the Saudis talking about direct aggression and war the coalition's command considers this a blatant act of military aggression by the Iranian regime and could rise to be considered as an act of war against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia you know the might and position of the Islamic Republic people more powerful than you have been unable to do anything against the Iranian people you're not strong enough to do that wherever we look in the region conflicts can often be boiled down to Saudi Arabia in Iran countering each other by proxy the Saudi military campaign against the Houthi rebels in Yemen backed by Iran Saudi backing of Sunni rebel groups in Syria while Iran supports the Assad government both of those conflicts aren't exactly panning out well for Saudi Arabia so how would they fare in a direct conflict with Iran let's break it down looking at a global military strength rating the two countries aren't far apart on the list with Iran at 21st and Saudi Arabia taking the 24th position and while Riyadh's aviation outstrips Terrans iran wins out when it comes to tanks and naval assets by a long run it's probably no surprise that the Saudi Kingdom has a massive defense budget coming in at over 56 billion dwarfing the Islamic Republic's six billion and change but when it comes to manpower Iran has significantly more citizens fit for service in the event of war you have a very rush ruler in Saudi Arabia I'm talking about the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman you know he's just about ready to do any dangerous acts if you look at what happened with the Lebanese Prime Minister SAR Kennedy was basically forced to resign that gives you just an indicator of how far Bahamut bin Salman is willing to go but I personally would be very very surprised if Saudi Arabia lost the war on Iran I would completely rule out Iran launching a war on Saudi Arabia if Saudi Arabia had guarantees or chance of winning I think that would go ahead with the war but I think Saudi Arabia believes it doesn't have a chance of winning and winning a war against Iran the rhetoric might be at a boiling point at the moment but there's still no sign either side is ready for open conflict
