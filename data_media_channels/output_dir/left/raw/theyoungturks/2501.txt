1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,370
PERHAPS THE MOST COMMONLY
USED ARGUMENT AGAINST RAISING

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,279
THE MINIMUM WAGE IS THAT
SUPPOSEDLY IF YOU DO THAT IT

3
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:07,850
WILL LEAD TO JOB ELIMINATION.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,730
THE IDEA IS YOU ARE TRYING TO

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,710
HELP PEOPLE BUT YOU ARE IN FACT
GETTING THEM FIRED.

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,710
I HEAR THAT

7
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,710
ALL THE TIME, AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL CHANGE

8
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,340
THEIR MIND ON THAT BASED ON DATA
BEING PRESENTED TO THEM BUT I

9
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,340
WILL TRY ANYWAY, BECAUSE WE HAVE
A NEW STUDY THAT ANALYZED THE

10
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,140
EFFECT ON JOBS OF NOT JUST ONE
TIME THAT THEY RAISED THE

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,390
MINIMUM WAGE, IT WAS 137
DIFFERENT CASES WHERE THE

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,620
MINIMUM WAGE WAS RAISED, LET'S
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CHART, WHAT

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,620
YOU ARE SEEING THERE IS RIGHT ON
THE SIDE OF ZERO TO ONE DOLLARS

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,390
AROUND THE NEW MINIMUM WAGE, YOU
HAVE JOBS THAT PAY SLIGHTLY LESS

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,329
GOING DOWN BY BETWEEN 1 AND
1.5%, IT LOOKS BIG BECAUSE OF

16
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:53,180
THE SCALE OF THE CHART BUT IT IS
1.5%, AND JOBS THAT PAY MORE

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,940
THAN THE NEW MINIMUM WAGE GO UP
BY 1.5%.

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,940
THE REST OF THOSE BARS

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,149
ARE BASICALLY NOTHING, THEY
AREN'T STATISTICALLY

20
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,149
SIGNIFICANT.

21
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:17,000
SO WHAT YOU HAVE
THERE 

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
IS --

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,250
>>THIS IS 137 DIFFERENT
INSTANCES WHERE THEY RAISE THE

24
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,460
MINIMUM WAGE, GIVING US
EXPERIENCES IN BOTH CITIES AND

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,570
NON-CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
OVER TIME, MANY DIFFERENT

26
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,740
SITUATIONS.

27
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,080
IT DOESN'T KILL
JOBS, POLITICIANS AND

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,770
CONSERVATIVE PUNDITS WILL
CONTINUE TO USE THAT AS AN

29
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,550
EXCUSE TO NOT SET THE MINIMUM
WAGE AT A LIVABLE, HUMANE LEVEL,

30
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,680
BUT THE DATA IS SIMPLE ENOUGH
THERE.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,140
TAKE IT UP WITH SCIENCE.

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,170
>>THE ONE CASE THEY LOVE TO
REFER TO IS THE SEATTLE CASE.

33
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,170
THE PERSON WHO PUSHED THROUGH
THE HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE IN

34
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,420
SEATTLE, I HAD HER ON REBEL
HEADQUARTERS FAIRLY RECENTLY,

35
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:08,949
YOU CAN CHECK OUT THAT INTERVIEW
AT TYT POLITICS, MINIMUM WAGE

36
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,569
WENT UP TO $15.

37
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,780
AND THAT ONE
STUDY THEY FOUND OUT THAT IT DID

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,810
HURT EMPLOYMENT A LITTLE IN
SEATTLE.

39
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,840
NOW, THE PERSONAL

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,680
ANALYZED THAT STUDY, THE OUTSIDE
PERSON WHO ANALYZED IT, AT THE

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,570
TIME SAID THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT
THE STUDY INDICATES AND IT'S

42
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,480
FAIR TO POINT THAT OUT.

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,420
THEN,
HAVING LOOKED AT THE 137 STUDIES

44
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,320
JOHN IS REFERRING TO, HE WAS
LIKE, NEVERMIND.

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
BECAUSE I DON'T

46
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,010
KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, AND
SCIENTISTS KNOW THIS, THEY ARE

47
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,420
GOOD AT MATH, 137 IS LARGER THAN
ONE.

48
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,340
EVEN SO, SCIENTISTS LOOK AT

49
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:51,820
THIS AND SAY I KNOW IT'S EASY TO
JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS AND HOW IT'S

50
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,850
COVERED IN THE NEWS, PEOPLE WILL
USE IT FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL

51
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,470
BENEFITS, BUT EVEN THESE HAVEN'T
BEEN PEER-REVIEWED ENOUGH.

52
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,470
YOU

53
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:05,120
HAVE TO DO PEER-REVIEWED, AND
THEN YOU CAN REACH CONCLUSIONS.

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,569
AND THEN ONE OF THE FOLKS
INVOLVED IN THE FIRST STUDY, I

55
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,269
BELIEVE, WENT ON TO MAKE AN
INTERESTING POINT, WE WILL HAVE

56
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:13,780
TO SEE IF IT'S BORNE OUT, IT'S
NOT SOMETHING THAT'S TO OUR

57
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,760
POLITICAL ADVANTAGE, BUT WE TRY
AS HARD AS WE CAN TO NOT COLOR

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,320
THE FACTS FOR YOU GUYS, GIVE YOU
THE FACTS AND THEN GIVE YOU OUR

59
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
OPINIONS.

60
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,850
SO HE SAYS THE REASON
WHY SEATTLE EMPLOYMENT MIGHT

61
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,380
HAVE BEEN HURT A LITTLE BIT
BASED ON THAT ONE STUDY IS

62
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,080
BECAUSE THE JUMP IN MINIMUM WAGE
WAS SO SIGNIFICANT.

63
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
HE SAYS THAT

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,020
JUMP WAS ABOUT 37% FROM THE
PREVIOUS MINIMUM WAGE, AND FOR

65
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,569
THE META STUDY OF 137 CASES
WHERE THE MINIMUM WAGE WENT UP,

66
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,840
THE OVERALL JUMP WAS 10%.

67
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,870
MINIMUM WAGE WAS ONLY INCREASED

68
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,910
BY 10% ON AVERAGE, SO WITH THAT
INCREASE IT USUALLY DOESN'T LEAD

69
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,220
TO LESS EMPLOYMENT, IN FACT IT
LEADS TO SLIGHTLY MORE

70
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,280
EMPLOYMENT AND AT HIGHER WAGES.

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,870
AND AGAIN, LET THAT GET

72
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,790
PEER-REVIEWED, ETC., SO IF YOU
WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM THAT

73
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,440
BEFORE THE PEER REVIEWS, MAYBE
WE MIGHT NOT WANT A 37% JUMP IN

74
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,440
THE MINIMUM WAGE --

75
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,770
>>ABRUPTLY.

76
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,579
>>AND YOU ARE IRONICALLY
PUNISHING THE PLACES THAT HAVE

77
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,420
THE LOWEST MINIMUM WAGE BY NOT
INCREASING THEM HIGHER, BUT I

78
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,130
GET IT, IT'S RELEVANT DATA YOU
COULD LOOK AT.

79
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,760
SO DON'T GET

80
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,300
COLORED BY YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE,
LOOK AT THE FACTS FIRST.

81
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
AND IF

82
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,641
IT TURNS OUT THEY LOOKED AT 137
CASES, AND THE MINIMUM NATIONAL

83
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:50,730
WAGE IS SO LOW THAT LOCATIONS
MIGHT CHANGE IT BY 

84
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,730
DIFFERENT

85
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:57,480
AMOUNTS, IT CREATES ALL THESE
EXPERIMENTS AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO

86
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,241
COME UP WITH A LOT MORE STUDIES,
THEN PEER-REVIEW THEM, THAT WE

87
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:03,930
WILL HAVE MORE DEFINITIVE
ANSWERS.

88
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,930
WHETHER YOU LIKE THOSE

89
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,490
ANSWERS OR YOU DON'T I THINK
THEY ARE INTERESTING AND WILL BE

90
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,490
INDICATIVE OF SOMETHING.

91
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,790
AND I
WILL LOOK AT IT AND IF THEY TELL

92
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,020
ME IT TURNS OUT IF YOU JUMP
MINIMUM WAGE MORE THAN 25% AT

93
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,120
ONE TIME IT COSTS JOBS, I WILL
GO THEN THAT'S WHAT IT DOES SO

94
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,800
LET'S THINK ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS
RIGHT.

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
BECAUSE THE CORRECT

96
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,900
ANSWER ISN'T THE ONE YOU HAD
BEFORE THE FACTS, IT'S THE ONE

97
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,270
YOU HAVE AFTER THE FACTS.

98
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,440
>>IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE
GRADUAL RAISING OF THE WAGE, AS

99
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,360
OPPOSED TO THE SUDDEN INCREASE
-- AND THERE HAS TO BE A

100
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,520
THRESHOLD, THAT IS WHAT CENK IS
SAYING, AT SOME POINT WE WILL

101
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,820
KNOW WHAT THAT THRESHOLD IS AT
LEAST FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE

102
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,930
TIME, IT APPEARS THAT THAT IS
THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO RAISE

103
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,930
THE MINIMUM WAGE.

104
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,770
BUT THE
MINIMUM WAGE CRITICISMS HAVE

105
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,460
BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH FEWER JOBS,
AND THIS WOULD SEEM TO SHOOT

106
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,700
THAT OUT OF THE WATER, AND ALSO
A DRAG ON THE ECONOMY.

107
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,700
IT COSTS

108
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,150
BUSINESSES MORE, THEY WILL
EMPLOY FEWER PEOPLE, AND THAT

109
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,350
HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL DISPROVEN.

110
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,740
IT BECOMES AN ENGINE OF THE

111
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,820
ECONOMY ONCE PEOPLE HAVE MORE
MONEY.

112
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,820
THAT GETS MORE MONEY INTO

113
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,820
THE SYSTEM.

114
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,370
SO THERE ARE A FEW
CONCLUSIONS TO BE MADE, AND IT'S

115
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,900
TOUGH TO GET THESE PEER-REVIEWED
STUDIES NOW BECAUSE THERE IS

116
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,080
SUCH A DEMAND ON INFORMATION.

117
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,500
WHAT IS YOUR STUDY ON MINIMUM

118
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,890
WAGE, WE NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW,
I NEED TO PUBLISH IT.

119
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,890
SO IT'S

120
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,650
HARDER AND HARDER TO GET THAT
RESEARCH OUT THERE, BUT IT

121
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,230
APPEARS AS THOUGH THESE RISES
AND INCREASES IN THE MINIMUM

122
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,330
WAGE REALLY DO HELP THE OVERALL
ECONOMY AND DO HELP THE

123
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,400
JOBLESSNESS PROBLEM.

124
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,080
>>AND IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING,
BUT HELPS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

125
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,960
SUDDENLY MAKING SLIGHTLY MORE
MONEY.

126
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,229
>>AN ACTUAL LIVING WAGE.

127
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:45,510
>>I HOPE THIS IS WIDELY
PUBLISHED AND PEOPLE TALK ABOUT

128
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,850
THIS, BUT WILL IT CONVINCE PAUL
RYAN AND A LOT OF PEOPLE?

129
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,850
NO,

130
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,750
BECAUSE THEY CAN SAY ALL THEY
WANT THAT THEY ARE JUST WORRIED

131
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,949
ABOUT JOB LOSSES BUT THEY DON'T
CARE AT ALL ABOUT THAT.

132
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:56,949
HERE IS

133
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,310
WHAT YOU DON'T NEED A STUDY TO
KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECT OF RAISING

134
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,750
THE MINIMUM WAGE, IS YOU HAVE TO
PAY PEOPLE MORE.

135
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,750
THAT I KNOW

136
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,050
HAPPENS, AND THEY DON'T WANT
THAT.

137
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,050
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY

138
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,569
OF THE CONSEQUENCES, THEY
DON'T WANT TO PAY YOU.

139
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,570
THEY WOULD PAY YOU ZERO IF THEY
COULD.

140
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,820
>>ALL THAT RHETORIC ABOUT THE
MIDDLE CLASS AND THE WORKING MAN

141
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,160
AND BEING THE PARTY OF WORKING
PEOPLE, IT'S TOTAL B.S. AS JOHN

142
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,780
SAYS IT'S INTELLECTUALLY
DISHONEST, THEY JUST DON'T WANT

143
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,090
MORE MONEY GOING TO THOSE PEOPLE
MAKING MINIMUM WAGE.

144
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,110
>>AND ONE MORE THING ABOUT
LOGIC AND FACTS -- CORPORATIONS

145
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,880
ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CARE ABOUT
YOUR FEELINGS, THEY HAVE TO

146
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
MAXIMIZE PROFITS.

147
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,830
SO WHAT IS ONE
WAY LOGICALLY THEY WOULD

148
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,150
MAXIMIZE PROFIT?

149
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,720
IT'S TO
SUPPRESS YOUR WAGES, SO EVERY

150
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,740
PENNY YOU MAKE IS UP PENNY OF
PROFIT THEY DON'T MAKE.

151
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,740
SO THEY

152
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,140
WILL BRING DOWN YOUR WAGES TO
THE LOWEST POSSIBLE POINT UNTIL

153
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,370
THEY REACH A BREAKING POINT AND
PEOPLE WON'T WORK FOR THEM

154
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,330
ANYMORE.

155
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,539
THEY HAVE A FIDUCIARY
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT.

156
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:56,539
SO

157
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:59,780
THE SECOND WAY YOU MAKE MONEY IS
BUY POLITICIANS ON THE OPEN

158
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,330
MARKET, BECAUSE WE HAVE A SYSTEM
THAT ALLOWS FOR LEGALIZED

159
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,090
BRIBERY IN AMERICA, BECAUSE THE
POLITICIANS WILL THEN MAKE SURE

160
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,110
THE MINIMUM WAGE DOESN'T
INCREASE, SO THAT ALL THOSE

161
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,190
EXTRA PENNIES AND DOLLARS STAY
IN THE CORPORATIONS AS PROFIT

162
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,160
AND AREN'T PAID TO THE
EMPLOYEES.

163
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,320
ALL THIS IS VERY

164
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
LOGICAL.

165
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,440
THAT IS WHY WHEN YOU
HAVE A STUDY LIKE THE SEATTLE

166
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,210
STUDY, ONE OUT OF THE 137, AND I
LOOKED AT THE WASHINGTON POST

167
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,130
STORY, WHO DID THE STUDY?

168
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,850
WAS AT
THE KOCH BROTHERS, ETC., IT

169
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,720
WASN'T, IT WAS LEGITIMATE ACTORS
AND PROFESSORS, ETC. -- AND BY

170
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:42,740
ACTORS I DON'T MEAN TV ACTORS --
HONEST ACTORS AND PROFESSIONALS

171
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,720
WHO DID THIS STUDY, SO IT'S A
LEGITIMATE STUDY YOU SHOULD LOOK

172
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
AT.

173
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,860
BUT TO JOHN'S POINT, THEN
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A VESTED

174
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,939
INTEREST IN KEEPING YOUR WAGES
LOW TOOK THAT STUDY AND DID

175
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:57,680
PROPAGANDA TO NO END, NONSTOP
TALKING ABOUT IT, AS IF IT'S THE

176
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,480
ONLY STUDY DONE ON MINIMUM
WAGES.

177
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,399
>>AND AS IF IT HAS ANYTHING TO
SAY ABOUT GRADUAL, SMALLER

178
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,050
CHANGES HAPPENING IN PLACES
OTHER THAN SEATTLE.

179
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,869
>>SO IT'S LIKELY THE ONLY STUDY
YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT OUTSIDE THIS

180
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:15,649
SHOW IS THE SEATTLE STUDY, BUT
IN REALITY THERE ARE 137 STUDIES

181
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:18,839
AND THEY SAY THE OPPOSITE OF
WHAT THE SEATTLE STUDY SAYS.

182
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,550
OVERALL IT NOT ONLY INCREASES
THE NUMBER OF JOBS, BUT DON'T

183
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,329
FORGET, IT ALSO INCREASES YOUR
WAGES.

184
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:26,329
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF

185
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:28,999
PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO
INCREASE YOUR WAGES THAT ARE NOW

186
00:09:28,999 --> 00:00:00,000
PUBLICIZING THE ONE INSTEAD OF
THE 137 STUDIES.
