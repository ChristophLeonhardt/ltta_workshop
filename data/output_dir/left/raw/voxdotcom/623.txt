00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,620
If you’ve never heard of the Zika virus
before this year, you’re not alone.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:10,200
It was isolated from monkeys in 1947 in the
Zika rainforest in Uganda and since then it

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,440
hasn't really bothered humans much at all.
Until now. The Zika virus appeared in Brazil

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,800
for the first time in 2015, and more than
a million people have been infected since

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,460
then.
Just to put that into perspective, the last

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,360
largest outbreak happened in french polynesia
and it really only spread around to a couple

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,420
hundred people.
80% of people with the virus don’t have

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,780
symptoms at all.The others have mild symptoms
including fever and a rash.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,559
So here’s why public health officials are
concerned.

10
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,280
Now we're learning that when pregnant women
contract Zika, they can pass it on to their

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,069
fetuses and this in turn can cause terrible birth defects.
This is microcephaly. It’s a birth defect

12
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:51,420
that involves incomplete head and brain development.
So they look like they have very small heads,

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,109
and what that means is that they're basically mentally
disabled, they have a shorter life expectancy

14
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:02,789
and it's just an absolutely devastating disease.
Microcephaly has multiple causes, but officials

15
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,840
think it might also be linked to Zika.
That’s why public health officials in Latin

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,000
America and the Caribbean are cautioning women
not to get pregnant right now.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,170
In the US the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention took a similarly extreme measure

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,930
when they issued an unprecedented travel advisory
telling women who are pregnant to avoid traveling

19
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:28,640
to countries in Latin America where the virus
is circulating. That included their very own

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,939
territory, Puerto Rico.
Zika virus is carried by mosquitos. it might

21
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,039
be transmitted through sex as well.
And the type of mosquitos that spread Zika

22
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:40,770
live in warm areas all over the world, including
the US.

23
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,450
The main vector for this disease is called the Aedes
aegypti, and it's mostly found along the southern

24
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,469
US. But there's some question about whether
it's also carried by another mosquito called

25
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:55,679
the Aedes albopictus and that has a much broader
range.

26
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,369
Right now there's no cure or treatment for
Zika.

27
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:03,429
They're working on vaccines but that could
take years. So really the only way to protect

28
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:07,880
yourself is to try not to get bitten by mosquitos,
which is difficult to do.

29
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,450
It’s especially important that pregnant
women are aware of the risk.

30
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,790
There needs to be a lot of awareness about
the virus and about this potential damage

31
00:02:15,790 --> 00:00:00,000
to the fetus later.
