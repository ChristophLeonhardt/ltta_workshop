00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so halloween is coming up</font>

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,240
you might be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Halloween</font>

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,830
reads I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some Halloween reads to</font>

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,600
give so let's get started the first

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,340
we're going to talk about today<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,469
people have mentioned already on the

7
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,820
book cheese because it's been quite

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,710
popular and quiet books are always quite

9
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,000
popular because they're so good and

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,230
they're so well presented you might be

11
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,609
thinking that book looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an IKEA</font>

12
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,320
catalog but it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> an Oscar</font>

13
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">catalog sort of the story the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> story's</font>

14
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,760
inside as well in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> effing pages it</font>

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,740
shows you the store plan it shows you

16
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,050
how you navigate this kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> scandi</font>

17
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,939
style store and at the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> of each</font>

18
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,800
chapter is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an item that may or may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

19
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,750
relate to the narrative and may or may

20
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,910
not get increasingly creepy the premise

21
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,370
of this is story boys working a night

22
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,110
shift which anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's worked in</font>

23
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">retail can probably identify with and I</font>

24
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,290
think that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a huge way into the</font>

25
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,520
book for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me because there's someone</font>

26
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">whose work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach out there's a lot</font>

27
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,270
about company branding like the lies

28
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,160
they tell not the lies they tell by the

29
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,199
way they spin everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for how the</font>

30
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,690
layout of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shop works to mess with</font>

31
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,610
your brain as an employee but also

32
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,399
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than anything kind of molds</font>

33
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,760
the customer experience and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

34
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,479
in some ways a bit like<font color="#CCCCCC"> foucault but the</font>

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,799
character who<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say is probably</font>

36
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">the protagonist is a me and she's</font>

37
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,460
wonderful because she's a pathetic but

38
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,990
she's not too apathetic you know when

39
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,340
you get those narrators who kind of hate

40
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,659
the life and hate it bit too much new

41
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,920
just one punch in the face because they

42
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,680
sound sound grateful with her it's a bit

43
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,479
less like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like it's not too much</font>

44
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,860
but you definitely get the sense that

45
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,600
this is someone who is ready to move on

46
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,570
and do other things and sees this to

47
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,000
reach out job as like something that's

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,130
holding her back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sees it as kind of</font>

49
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,200
a prison<font color="#CCCCCC"> to space it's kind of a present</font>

50
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,400
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

51
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,659
will scare the crap out of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

52
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,829
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the book but if you're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

53
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,630
an enjoyable<font color="#E5E5E5"> horror reading experience</font>

54
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,280
but I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one for you a</font>

55
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,450
book that I actually just finished this

56
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">morning and really basically read this</font>

57
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,479
morning because I read it in one sitting

58
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">with shadow and bone which is sort of</font>

59
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,049
magical and fantasy at the same time

60
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,189
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot to do with like</font>

61
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,049
inherited magic and inherited skills

62
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,670
which in turn makes me think of<font color="#CCCCCC"> God Nick</font>

63
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that's kind of been on the brain ever</font>

64
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,149
since I got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to interview</font>

65
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,969
him these two kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> as with all your kids</font>

66
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> age in their world in their area are</font>

67
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,219
tested to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not they have</font>

68
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,810
these magical skills or they have these

69
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,479
gifts and thus this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of like in</font>

70
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,190
the prologue and then five pages later

71
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,230
you flash forward 10 years and you find

72
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're in the army they don't have</font>

73
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,500
these magical skills but they're very

74
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,690
very skilled at other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard</font>

75
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,460
to really say more than that because

76
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,320
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of twisting this book</font>

77
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,600
twists and turns fantastically it really

78
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">took me by surprise on a number of</font>

79
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,960
occasions it's very conscious of I guess

80
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,680
the conventions of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> team genre and</font>

81
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,080
more really of the conventions of teen

82
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,300
experience and what teenage girls in

83
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular are expected to experience it</font>

84
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,400
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> spin it like in some ways that</font>

85
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">really surprised and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed me but</font>

86
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,030
again can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really go into too much more</font>

87
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,160
detail from that the world is really

88
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">well built but it is quite a small world</font>

89
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,700
it's quite contained this one you must

90
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,840
have all know I've definitely talked

91
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,800
about in the past which<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

92
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,540
to star by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Maureen Johnson but living in</font>

93
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">East</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> London and running into Jack the</font>

94
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,800
Ripper<font color="#E5E5E5"> tours constantly I feel like this</font>

95
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,300
is definitely gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be my Halloween week</font>

96
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,400
reread and then there's the supernatural

97
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,630
enhancements which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't classify</font>

98
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,810
really as why a or kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> is anything</font>

99
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,090
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a multimedia experience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

100
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">of ways transcripts of audio video</font>

101
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,100
recordings and part of it is you trying

102
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,660
to solve these clues and put<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

103
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,610
together the crux of the story is that

104
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,730
this guy has<font color="#E5E5E5"> inherited this house and</font>

105
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,280
all its belongings absolute absolute

106
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,140
wealth from this second cousin twice

107
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,850
removed but the particular strange thing

108
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,110
is that the person from whom he's

109
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,180
inheriting has died in exactly the same

110
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,640
way as his father had died 30 years

111
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,920
prior and that's by committing suicide

112
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,570
by throwing himself out the window

113
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,070
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of other strangeness the</font>

114
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,170
secret societies that's freaky dreams

115
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,700
there's a lot of ciphers that's

116
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,580
cryptography and all of that element I

117
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,519
very much enjoyed reading but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

118
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,489
something about the dynamic between the

119
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,280
guy who inherits all the wealth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

120
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,650
sidekick knees Nev is a super fast

121
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,630
thinker I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think she's 17 years old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she's</font>

122
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,190
selected me I said that she's the one

123
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,690
that does more of the problem solving

124
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,209
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> his relationship to her sometimes is</font>

125
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:07,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">just incredibly weird and it made me</font>

126
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of uncomfortable and sort of made</font>

127
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,060
me wish the story walk eat to her

128
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,390
perspective and that you'd yeah you had

129
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,070
more of like her diary entries rather

130
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,690
than his just because there was

131
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,798
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Dinah</font>

132
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,029
making that tension there that just

133
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,710
didn't quite work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I</font>

134
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,120
smoking weed to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cure for</font>

137
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,909
day on Halloween which is her birthday

138
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:33,099
she goes to see an illusionist perform

139
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:34,389
and because it's her birthday she's

140
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,340
invited up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stage turns out there when</font>

141
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,569
she<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes back to reality that this</font>

142
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,099
illusion is<font color="#E5E5E5"> stood on her body when she</font>

143
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:41,409
was rigid as a plank on stage which

144
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,599
causes much scandal the book is<font color="#E5E5E5"> set in</font>

145
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,819
Portland Oregon a time of the suffragist

movement and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Olivia me the main</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">outbursts and she is very sympathetic</font>

149
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,460
and believes I think quite strongly in

150

the suffragist movement but<font color="#E5E5E5"> her father</font>

hypnotist of whom he's heard so much

155
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,310
about since he invited his daughter up

156
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,520
onstage on her birthday to hypnotize her
