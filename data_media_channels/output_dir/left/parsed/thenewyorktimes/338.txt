Tonight I call upon all of us
to set aside our differences,
to seek out common ground
and to summon the unity
we need to deliver
for the people ... .
All of us together as one
team, one people
and one American family
can do anything.
We face rogue regimes, terrorist
groups and rivals like China
and Russia that challenge
our interests,
our economy and our values.
Struggling communities,
especially immigrant communities,
will also be helped
by immigration policies
that focus on the best interests
of American workers
and American families.
We must modernize and rebuild
our nuclear arsenal,
hopefully never having to use it. ...
Perhaps someday
in the future, there
will be a magical moment
when the countries of the world
will get together to eliminate
their nuclear weapons.
