1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,230
If Dr. King came back and
seen the way things are,

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,416
he wouldn’t be pleased with it.

3
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:10,530
No, he wouldn’t
be pleased at all.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,955
All right.

5
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,320
I call us 
sanitation engineers

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,260
because we’re supposed
to run the job,

7
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,780
not let the job run us.

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,620
I was 24 years old
when I started.

9
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,920
But back then, it was
a different ball game.

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,595
Back then, the working
condition, it was unbearable.

11
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:01,080
After three weeks, when
I got my first check,

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,830
I broke down and cried.

13
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,190
We were working full time.

14
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,410
And at the same time,
the wages were so low,

15
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,070
we was qualified
to get food stamps.

16
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,150
We were determined that we was
going to get a union organized,

17
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,320
that we would see justice.

18
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,346
We were striking about the
wages, fair treatment

19
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:50,350
and dignity.

20
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,170
When we heard that Dr. King was
coming to Memphis to help us

21
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,520
in that sanitation strike,
we were very surprised.

22
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,400
We knew then that
there was somebody

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,440
that cared about our struggle.

24
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,810
We was at Mason Temple
this particular night.

25
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,890
Dr. King said, the Lord allowed
me to go to the mountaintop

26
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,830
and to look over into
the promised land.

27
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,510
And he said, I might
not get there with you,

28
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,450
but we will make it
to the promised land.

29
00:02:32,162 --> 00:02:35,360
Everybody was just
jubilated, just

30
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,630
excited, not knowing
the next day

31
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,463
would be a day of silence.

32
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,920
Because of Dr. King’s death,
that was one of the reasons

33
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,650
that Mayor Loeb went on
and signed that union

34
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,690
into a decree.

35
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,530
We got what we wanted,
but at the same time,

36
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,984
we lost the great leader.

37
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,856
“He never thought in terms
of his personal welfare,

38
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:33,090
but always in terms of the cause
which he dedicated his life to.”

39
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,140
I really had a lot of animosity.

40
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,780
I came from the streets.

41
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,290
I was a street thug.

42
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,320
And Dr. King was the
one that taught me,

43
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,050
through his humility
and his leadership.

44
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,117
I said, that’s the
way I’d like to be.

45
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,530
“— united will never be defeated.

46
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,506
The workers united
will never be defeated.

47
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:10,985
The workers united
will never be defeated.

48
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:16,949
The workers united
will never be defeated.”

49
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:20,940
There are still some unsolved
problems need to be solved.

50
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,935
“What do we want?”

51
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:22,932
“15.”

52
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:23,926
“When do we want it?”

53
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:24,426
“Now!”

54
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:25,420
“What do we want?”

55
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:25,920
“15.”

56
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,414
“When do want it?”

57
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:28,410
“Now!”

58
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,520
It is what it is until somebody
can roll his sleeves up and get

59
00:04:43,520 --> 00:00:00,000
out there and fight.
