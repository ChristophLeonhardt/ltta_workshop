1
00:00:00,476 --> 00:00:01,844
SUCH TIME AS WE HAVE

2
00:00:01,844 --> 00:00:03,178
DEMONSTRATED THAT NORTH KOREA

3
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:05,681
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY

4
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:06,348
DENUCLEARIZED.

5
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:08,117
PAUL: THAT WAS MIKE POMPEO IN

6
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:09,952
SEOUL THIS WEEK INSISTING

7
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:11,186
SANCTIONS WILL NOT COME TO NORTH

8
00:00:11,186 --> 00:00:13,722
KOREA UNTIL IT COMPLETELY

9
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,156
DENUCLEARIZES.

10
00:00:14,156 --> 00:00:16,024
A PROCESS THE SECRETARY OF STATE

11
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:17,159
COULD TAKE A LONG AS 2 AND A

12
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:17,893
HALF YEARS.

13
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,895
PYONGYANG STAGED THE DESTRUCTION

14
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,730
OF ONE OF ITS TEST SITES LAST

15
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,866
MONTH BUT DISMANTLING ITS ENTIRE

16
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:24,933
NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS ANOTHER

17
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:25,267
MATTER.

18
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:28,137
HOW CAN THE U.S. VERIFY WHAT

19
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:30,606
NORTH KOREA ACTUALLY HAS IN ITS

20
00:00:30,606 --> 00:00:32,908
ARSENAL, LET'S ASK DAVID

21
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,410
ALRIGHT, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT

22
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,078
OF INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND

23
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,179
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND

24
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:39,248
FORMER WEAPON'S INSPECTOR.

25
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,649
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

26
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,050
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.

27
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,622
PAUL: SO LET'S START OUT BY --

28
00:00:46,622 --> 00:00:48,190
HOW MANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS DO WE

29
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,392
THINK NORTH KOREA REALLY HAS?

30
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:52,461
>> WELL, IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT

31
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:55,998
ESTIMATE TO MAKE BECAUSE WE KNOW

32
00:00:55,998 --> 00:00:56,932
-- NOT THAT MUCH.

33
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,034
I MEAN, ESTIMATES I'VE MADE

34
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:03,338
ANYWHERE FROM 15 TO 35 NUCLEAR

35
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:06,375
WEAPONS, THE NUMBER COULD BE

36
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,910
HIGHER IF THEY HAVE MORE

37
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,212
CAPABILITY THAN -- THAN WE ARE

38
00:01:10,212 --> 00:01:11,747
ESTIMATING, SO IT'S VERY TOUGH

39
00:01:11,747 --> 00:01:13,415
BUT THEY HAVE, YOU KNOW, A

40
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:15,250
COUPLE OF DOZEN NUCLEAR WEAPONS,

41
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,352
MAYBE, THERE'S A CHANCE IT'S

42
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:20,355
FEWER, BUT, AGAIN, UNCERTAIN.

43
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:22,424
THE PROBLEM IS IT'S VERY HARD TO

44
00:01:22,424 --> 00:01:24,993
KNOW WHERE COUNTRIES MAKE

45
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:26,395
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND WHERE THEY

46
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:30,232
STORE THEM, SO WHAT WE FALL BACK

47
00:01:30,232 --> 00:01:31,600
TO TYPICALLY IS TRYING TO LOOK

48
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,503
AT THEIR CAPABILITIES TO MAKE

49
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:36,205
PLUTONIUM AND WEAPON GRADE

50
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:37,439
URANIUM AND THOSE FACILITIES

51
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,807
TEND TO BE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND

52
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,311
AND TO INSPECT.

53
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,245
PAUL: ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY OF

54
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:45,380
THOSE FACILITIES DO WE HAVE, FOR

55
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,683
A WHILE WE HAD A PLUTONIUM SITE

56
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:50,519
BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

57
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,887
ENRICHED URANIUM SITE?

58
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:53,489
>> THAT'S RIGHT, PLUTONIUM IS

59
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:54,423
MUCH BETTER UNDERSTOOD.

60
00:01:54,423 --> 00:01:56,792
A FOCUS OF THE SIX-PARTY TALKS

61
00:01:56,792 --> 00:02:00,462
IN THE 2000'S AND EARLIER, AND A

62
00:02:00,462 --> 00:02:01,497
LOT IS KNOWN ABOUT THAT.

63
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,432
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A SECRET

64
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:05,100
REACTOR BUT THEY DO HAVE A

65
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,969
SECRET ENRICHMENT PLAN WE ARE

66
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:09,071
PRETTY SURE, AND WE DON'T KNOW

67
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:10,739
-- WESTERN INTELLIGENCE HAS A

68
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,441
GOOD IDEA WHERE THE PLANT IS.

69
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:15,811
THEY ALSO HAVE ANOTHER ONE WHICH

70
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:17,045
THEY BUILT IN SECRET AND

71
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:19,014
REVEALED IN 2010.

72
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,249
SO I THINK THE WORKING

73
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:22,784
ASSUMPTION IS THEY HAVE TWO

74
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:24,920
SUBSTANTIAL URANIUM ENRICHMENT

75
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,221
PLANTS, ONE NORTH KOREA ADMITS

76
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:27,689
TO, AND ONE IT DOESN'T AND THOSE

77
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,125
PLANTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE

78
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,393
THOROUGHLY INSPECTED, BUT BEFORE

79
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:33,262
THAT, I MEAN, WHAT YOU WANT IN

80
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:35,397
VERIFICATION IS FOR THE COUNTRY

81
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:39,067
TO REVEAL IN AN HONEST WAY WHAT

82
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,869
IN THIS CASE INCLUDING ITS

83
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,338
NUCLEAR WEAPON'S PRODUCTION

84
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:45,007
CAPABILITIES AND SIZE OF NUCLEAR

85
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:45,641
ARSENAL.

86
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,309
PAUL: RIGHT, THAT MEANS THAT AT

87
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:48,777
A FIRST STEP WHAT YOU WANT FROM

88
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:50,779
NORTH KOREA IS ESSENTIALLY A

89
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:52,014
DECLARATION, A LIST, HERE IS

90
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:53,415
WHAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF OUR

91
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:55,217
WEAPONS, IN TERMS OF OUR SITES

92
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,652
FOR BUILDING THOSE WEAPONS, IN

93
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:59,087
TERMS OF SITES ON BUILDING

94
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:01,223
URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM AND SO ON

95
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,958
AND SO ON.

96
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,560
>> AND THE INITIAL LIST COULD BE

97
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,162
ALMOST JUST LIKE A LIST, BUT YOU

98
00:03:07,162 --> 00:03:08,864
WOULD LIKE THEM FOR THEM TO

99
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:11,333
ALLOW VISITS TO THOSE SITES SO

100
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,501
INSPECTORS CAN IN A SENSE GET

101
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:14,369
THE LAY OF LAND AND INSPECTORS

102
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:16,338
SHOULD NOT BE INTERNATIONAL

103
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:17,539
ATOMIC AGENCY.

104
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,575
IT SHOULD BE EFFORT ORGANIZED BY

105
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,810
THE UNITED STATES AND ALLIES IN

106
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,179
THAT REGION INCLUDING CHINA,

107
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:26,248
WELL, NOT CALL THEM ALLY BUT AT

108
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,985
LEAST A FRIEND ON THIS ISSUE AND

109
00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:31,587
THEN NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO CREATE

110
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,555
A NARRATIVE OF ITS NUCLEAR

111
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:35,324
WEAPON'S PROGRAM AND THAT WOULD

112
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:38,527
BECOME A FULL-BLOWN DECLARATION

113
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:40,829
WHICH COULD BE VERIFIED BY

114
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,496
INSPECTORS.

115
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,065
PAUL: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

116
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:43,765
INSPECTORS, AN INTERNATIONAL

117
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,367
GROUP, NOT THE UN AND THE U.S.

118
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,536
SHOULD BE PART OF THAT, BUT DOES

119
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:49,037
IT HAVE TO BE INSPECTIONS THAT

120
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:50,739
ARE ESSENTIALLY ON DEMAND, THAT

121
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:52,274
MEANS ANYWHERE WE WANT TO LOOK,

122
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,276
WE CAN GO AND YOU'LL HELP US

123
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,278
LOOK AND SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT?

124
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,347
>> THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE THAT

125
00:03:58,347 --> 00:03:59,114
INTRUSIVE, I MEAN, BUT NORTH

126
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,050
KOREA HAS TO BE WILLING TO

127
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,353
ALLOW, WELL, TO TELL AN HONEST

128
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:06,188
STORY, I MEAN, IN THE SENSE YOU

129
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:07,556
KNOW WHEN YOU SEE IT, THEN

130
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:09,658
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME PLACES.

131
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:12,160
WE HAVE LIST OF SITES THAT ARE

132
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,362
SUSPECT NUCLEAR SITES AND THEY

133
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:14,896
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ALLOW SOME

134
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:17,031
LEVEL OF VISITS TO PLACES WHERE

135
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:18,567
WE JUST WANT TO CHECK IT OUT,

136
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:21,168
YOU KNOW, WHERE WERE WRONG AND

137
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:22,871
WERE WE RIGHT, IS IT FALLING OFF

138
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,539
THE LIST BECAUSE IT'S CLOSED

139
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,608
DOWN BUT SO THERE'S GOING TO

140
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:29,144
HAVE TO BE FAIRLY BROAD AND

141
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,345
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THE CASE

142
00:04:30,345 --> 00:04:32,180
OF IRAQ WHERE THE INSPECTORS HAD

143
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,248
THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO GO

144
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:33,715
ANYWHERE.

145
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:36,251
IT CAN BE LESS THAN THAT.

146
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:38,453
PAUL: BUT WHY LESS THAN THAT IF

147
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:39,921
WE KNOW FROM THE PAST THAT NORTH

148
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:41,990
KOREA HAS NOT TOLD THE TRUTH,

149
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,526
WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE JUST AS

150
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:46,561
INTRUSIVE BECAUSE SADDAM LIED

151
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,664
FOR YEARS AS WELL AND THAT'S WHY

152
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,732
IT WAS INTRUSIVE?

153
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:52,067
>> WHAT I'M SAYING IT WOULD BE

154
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:55,003
GREAT IF COULD BE THAT

155
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:55,370
INTRUSIVE.

156
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,805
NORTH KOREA HASN'T ALLOWED

157
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:59,408
INSPECTORS TO GO OUTSIDE BEYOND

158
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:00,642
MAYBE ONE OR TWO CASES WHERE

159
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:03,345
U.S. HAD A SPECIAL MISSION TO DO

160
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,681
AND PAID QUITE A PRICE TO GET

161
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,382
THERE.

162
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:08,750
SO I THINK WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

163
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,252
IS DESIGN A SYSTEM WHERE IT'S

164
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,721
GOOD ENOUGH, BUT YOU DON'T WANT

165
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:14,523
TO DEMAND PERFECT.

166
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,558
PAUL: OKAY, DO WE HAVE TO INSIST

167
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:19,594
THAT THEY STOP ENRICHING URANIUM

168
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:21,897
AND WE BASICALLY BE ABLE TO HAUL

169
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:24,166
OUT ALL OF THE STOCKPILES OF

170
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,667
ENRICHED URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM

171
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,769
AND HAUL IT OUT OF THE COUNTRY?

172
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:28,603
>> THEY CERTAINLY HAVE TO STOP.

173
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:30,005
I MEAN, THAT'S GOING TO BE AN

174
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:30,305
ISSUE.

175
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:31,807
NORTH KOREA WILL SAY, WE HAVE

176
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:33,475
NEEDS, CIVIL REACTORS, WE WANT

177
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:34,543
TO FUEL, I THINK THE UNITED

178
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,545
STATES HAS TO BE VERY FIRM.

179
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,779
NO ENRICHMENT AT ALL.

180
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:40,248
IT'S JUST A BAD IDEA GIVEN THE

181
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:41,683
HISTORY OF THE WHOLE EFFORT WITH

182
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:42,517
NORTH KOREA.

183
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:45,020
THEY SHOULD BE SHUTTING DOWN AND

184
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,422
DISMANTLING URANIUM AND

185
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:49,391
ENRICHMENT PROGRAM ALONG WITH

186
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,926
PLUTONIUM AND WEAPON'S PROGRAM

187
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:52,160
AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

188
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,628
IT'S NOT ABOUT FREEZING, IT'S

189
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:56,131
REALLY ABOUT GETTING RID OF IN A

190
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:57,499
VERIFIABLE MANNER AND SO IT'S

191
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,668
CRITICAL TO DO THAT.

192
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:02,504
PAUL: I WOULD ASSUME THAT WOULD

193
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:03,839
INCLUDE PLUTONIUM AS WELL?

194
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,372
>> FOR SURE.

195
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:06,174
THEY MAY KEEP REACTOR

196
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:07,609
OPERATIONAL THAT IF SOMEHOW

197
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:08,977
MAKING ELECTRICITY, THEY MAY

198
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:10,779
EVEN IMPORT REACTORS BUT THEY

199
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,748
WOULDN'T BE ENRICHING URANIUM

200
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,250
FOR THOSE REACTORS, THOSE

201
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,052
REACTORS WOULD BE STRUCTURED OR

202
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:21,022
DISSIGNED IN A -- DESIGNED,

203
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:24,059
PROLIFERATION RESISTANT, BUT

204
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:26,027
THAT PART OF THE PEACEFUL ENERGY

205
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:26,962
PROGRAM WITH NORTH KOREA HAS TO

206
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:29,431
BE NEGOTIATED CAREFULLY AND

207
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,799
REALLY I DON'T THINK WE ARE EVEN

208
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,033
AT THAT STAGE YET.

209
00:06:32,033 --> 00:00:00,000
PAUL: RIGHT.
