00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,589
last week<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watched the first episode of</font>

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,899
the Carrie Diaries<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of prequel</font>

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,520
to Sex in the City which also doesn't

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,950
follow it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> canon whatsoever I've gotta</font>

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">first have said where my flatmate kaylee</font>

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,130
and we kind of really enjoyed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,349
weird bonding experience but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also</font>

8
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,100
pretty bad in terms of the fashion and

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,640
the writing and just you know whatever

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll see how it goes I live in hope</font>

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,970
there wasn't think it did make me<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,439
extremely aware of<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the tropes and television and film that</font>

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,210
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get on my nerves mainly</font>

15
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,560
because continuing the theme of last

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,899
week they make<font color="#CCCCCC"> me feel very stressed the</font>

17
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,250
number one example of this was something

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,809
that happened in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Carrie Diaries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

19
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that happens in like every bad</font>

20
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,559
television film ever made and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,540
very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> comedies as well that is the</font>

22
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,879
introduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the precious item the</font>

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,910
family heirloom the present probably

24
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">something to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with someone who's dead</font>

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,420
either that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with you</font>

26
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,120
know stopping<font color="#E5E5E5"> a war or like curing some</font>

27
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,129
disease whenever someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> is given a</font>

28
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:57,870
precious item and they seem a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

29
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,359
stupid or immediate stress situations

30
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,289
because I knew it there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

31
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:02,699
ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine

32
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,650
nine nine nine percent chance that that

33
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,420
item is going to end up lost stolen or

34
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,130
broken example number two arose from

35
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,869
watching another program with<font color="#CCCCCC"> kaylee yes</font>

36
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:10,950
