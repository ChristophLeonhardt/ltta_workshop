when California law Senator Barbara Boxer it looked as though the title for stupidest woman in the US Senate had been lost too but thanks to the election of Kamala Harris to fill her role California has retained its title holder on Friday Harris tweeted judge Gorsuch has consistently valued narrow legalisms over real lives I cannot support his nomination and there was an op-ed to back the city up Adie a contention up in it Harris argued the gore such a man so qualified that literally not one Democrat cast a vote against him for his federal appellate court position was unqualified to be on the Supreme Court why because the court quote has the power to do enormous good and gore such wouldn't do such good what good would he forego as a result of being you know like a judge according to Harris he would have voted to strike down laws forcing teachers to pay union dues because that's a violation of their First Amendment rights among other obvious legal issues but Harris says that because Gorsuch might take a look at that stupid old Constitution he cannot be confirmed she writes as US senators we have an obligation to also examine the nominees legal approach and ask whether he or she considers the impact of those decisions on our society and the daily lives of our people say wouldn't it be awesome if we had some sort of like independently elected branch to make public policy would that be awesome but according to Harris judges should fulfill the mandate if they're a good marshal who said quote you you do what you think is right and let the law catch up which coincidentally is also something that every dictator ever has said but nevermind Harris knows what is right for America judges who openly ignore legalism in order to apply her standards of morality I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show okay so we are going to get to all of the hubbub over Devon Nunez the head of the House intelligence community and the supposed scandal surrounding him visiting the White House we are going to get to Donald Trump's decision to reach out to Democrats rather than reaching out to conservatives we're gonna get to some good Trump and some bad Trump will do good Trump bad from today which is always exciting plus we'll deconstruct the culture but first we should say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriot supply so recently North Korea's been making a lot of noises about how they want a new cuss are they actually going to nuke us unlikely but if they tried to then now would be the time to stock up for your four-week emergency food supply for just $99 actually got a nice letter from somebody who is a who is somebody who'd gone and got the the food emergency food supply I prepared with been calm they said that there was a flaw on their packaging they immediately sent a note to the folks over at my Patriots supply and they fixed the problem immediately they were really responsive they're terrific folks over there prepare with Ben comm $99 plus free shipping provides you that four week emergency food supply which is great because even if you're not worried about North Korea nuking us you should be worried about a tornado or an earthquake there's always natural disasters and it takes a while for the government to get to people in some of these cases in some cases the government just doesn't show up at all and so it's important that you be able to protect your family make sure that you have as much food on hand as you need that's $99 for that four week emergency food supply folks in the office have tried it they say that it tastes really good prepare with been calm or eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen it's one of those things where you do it once and then you never have to worry about it again prepare with Ben calm to get your four week emergency food supply which is just something that you should have on hand regardless of you know foreign-made disasters or natural disasters you should always be prepared for an emergency and that's when my Patriots apply it does better than anybody else okay so the big scandal of the day is a fake controversy and that is Devin Nunez he's the head of the House Intelligence Committee he went over to the White House apparently and there he met with some intelligence official who told him all of the information that he broke last week now if you recall last week Devin Nunez went out into the press conference where he said that Donald Trump's team was surveilled now you said that they weren't wiretapped he said that what happened is that basically the intelligence officials were wired all of these all of these diplomats from foreign countries and those people had members of the Trump transition team on the other line as you'd imagine they would and then that information was disseminated in an irresponsible and/or criminal way so the dissemination of the information was really the question not the gathering of the information and that's an important distinction a lot of people on Team Trump have been saying that the intelligence community illegally gathered information there's no evidence of that whatsoever do they illegally disseminate information there there's actually a fair bit of evidence that they legally disseminated information about for example former national security adviser Mike Flynn but Democrats in the search for scandal have been looking somewhere else so what they say the case that they are making now is that basically Trump was engaged in some sort of nefarious activity with Russia and now they're trying to cover it up so today The Washington Post says quote the Trump administration sought to block former acting Attorney General Sally Yates from testifying to Congress in the house investigation into links between Russian officials and the Trump campaign according to a series of letters reviewed by The Washington Post Yates was notified earlier this month by the Justice Department that the administration considers a great deal of her possible testimony to be barred from discussion in a congressional hearing because the topics are covered by the presidential communication privilege now as you recall Barack Obama also asserted the presidential communication privilege when he was attempting to defend his attorney general eric holder from contempt of Congress under Republicans the eight was supposed to testify before the House Intelligence Committee this week defying the Trump administration and then Tevin Nunez mysteriously canceled the hearing at which you testify he now says that she will testify next week so the media immediately left to there's some sort of horrible cover-up in progress and they said that that cover-up is worse because last week before Nunez announced all of this stuff about the intelligence community disseminating information wrongly they Nunez went over to the White House so what he says is he went to the White House in order to use a secure computer so that he could look at intelligence information Lackland Markie alerted The Daily Beast he says this is kind of shady the house Intel committee has its own secure servers there's no need to use the one at the White House but what Nunez says is that the information was not available at Congress it was only available to the executive branch that's where the information was and that his chair of the house in telling it back to his colleagues he revealed what intelligence official actually community infer MIT it communicated the information to him and then he went back to the White House and told Trump about it now that's the part that's a little bit Shady the idea that he went he talked to this intelligence official and then he didn't tell any of his committee members and then he went and told Trump well if that were the case then why didn't the intelligence official just go tell Trump so people are latching on to this and they're saying well this is obviously some sort of cover-up obviously Nunez was fed something by the White House and then he went and updated Trump on the feeding and then he went out there and parroted the Trump line but there's not a ton of evidence that that is true there they're basically two theories about what Nunez is doing here Nene arre number one is the conspiratorial one that Nunez knows that there is something nefarious the Trump was doing with Russia and now he's out there attempting to misdirect at the behest of the White House which is why he visited the White House both before and after he went out and announced all of this stuff and and this has led to a tremendous breakdown in the House Intelligence Committee that they've canceled all their hearings for this week because people can't get along but here's the counterfactual here's another possibility let's imagine for a second that Obama intelligence community members are widely dispersing information illegally which is probably true and let's assume that Nunez found out about this from some sort of intelligence community whistleblower who didn't want to go directly to Trump because he doesn't trust Trump also very plausible because Trump has a big mouth from says whatever comes to his mind and he wouldn't want Trump to get him in trouble so instead he uses Nunez as his cover he calls up Nunez he says listen it's your job to figure out how to disseminate this information but I thought you ought to know you're the one on the Oversight Committee so you come and you see me right now Nunez goes to the White House to speak to that person because it's an executive branch agency and then he doesn't allow the aides testimony or at least the White House fights the aides testimony not because they think the Yates has something that they need to keep hidden but because Yates is just gonna go out there and be a political hack which again is not implausible because after all Yates is a political hack she was fired if you recall by the Trump administration for refusing to defend Trump's travel ban in court when she was acting Attorney General both of those theories are plausible but the media is only covering one of those theories and the Democrats are only pushing one of those theories and that is the núñez Trump cover-up theory and again the big question and all of that is where's the scandal if there's going to be a cover-up you assume something had to be done that was wrong so far the only thing I know that was done that was wrong in any of this is that there were intelligence officials who worked for Obama who are leaking a bunch of information to the press and leaking a bunch of information to the rest of the intelligence community and unmasking people that's the only thing I know was done wrong here I don't know anything was done wrong between the Trump team and Russia you know you can suspect whatever you want there's no evidence yeah I don't know that anything was done in terms of coordination with WikiLeaks I don't know that neither do you neither does anybody else again what's funny about this is that among all the leaks that have happened from the intelligence community to the press the one thing that hasn't been leaked is actual definitive information that says that Trump was connected to Russia still none of that there's all this smoke but there's no fire and so it's just as plausible as the cover-up theory that basically this is an incompetent Lee handled just normal order of business routine from Devon Nunez and President Trump so here is Nunez explaining why he went to the White House grounds in the first place the Congress has not been given this information these documents and that's the problem so so because the because this is executive branch it was distributed widely through the executive branch this was from November December and January and these were reports this let me reiterate this had nothing to do with Russia and nothing do the Russian investigation there is no way for the folks that I had been working with to actually to bring this forward to light there was no way I could view that because they couldn't get it to the House Intelligence Committee okay so he sort of says that I'm not gonna be able to transmit that to the House Intelligence Committee the house in telecasting what the hell why are you get to see and I don't get to see it Chuck Schumer the the Senate Minority Leader he says that the Paul Ryan should immediately fire Nunez basically mr. president if speaker Ryan wants the house to have a credible investigation he needs to replace Chairman Nunez and then that is followed up on immediately by Mark Warner who's senator from from Virginia and he says that basically Nunez has to go I am totally mystified by what mr. Nunez has said and I've talked to my chairman Richard burr he doesn't know I've talked to Democrats Republicans on the committee I think it's fairly mystifying if not rageous that he make these claims thence goes down and briefs the white house okay and finally you have Nunez responding I guess I'm being told that it's not pronounced Nunez even though everybody pronounced it that way it's actually pronounced Newton's I have no idea whether that's true in any case Devon Newton's he says that Democrats actually just want him out because he's effective effective at what nobody really understands yeah well I'm sure that the Democrats do want me to quit because they know that I'm a quite effective at getting to the bottom okay so he says that he's effective at getting to the bottom of things I doubt that's why Democrats want him to quit I think the Democrats want him to quit because one it would look like he's guilty and two because he will act as a shield for Trump in this I mean just to be perfectly honest with you whenever you have a member of the party of the president who's investigating the President himself it is very rare they get an honest and credible investigation very difficult to get an honest credible investigation of the president when the person who's leading the investigation was on the Trump transition team which Devin Nunes or Nunez was so I think that it is it is perfectly fair to say the media is over blowing this case and this is a fake scandal and that we don't even know what's going on yet and it is also perfectly fair to say that if you actually want a credible investigation that is going to be listened to by the vast majority of Americans you can't have somebody who's on Trump's transition team leading the investigation into Trump is just not gonna work that way but all of this is leading the left to lose their minds and they're absolutely going crazy so Senator Chris Coons of Connecticut he says that the the GOP for example on judge gore such they should never ever ever use the the what they call the nuclear option they should let the filibuster stand and let Gorsuch go down to the freedom it's just insane it's insane all right what so then the Republicans are gonna pass it using the so-called nuclear almost certainly and I think this is tragic and in talking to friends on both sides they all we've got a lot of senators concerned about where we're headed okay again the only reason they're talking about using the nuclear option is because they are talking about filibustering a Supreme Court nominee which has never been done before as far as I'm aware so and again this is Democrats losing their minds because they don't know what to do with with Gorsuch they don't know what to do with Trump they're very frustrated I understand some of the frustration but some of that is just endemic to not being in the party in power Bernie Sanders is back and he says that he hopes that the GOP does not change the rules when it comes to approving Supreme Court nominees what concerns me is that right now we have a rule that says appropriately I think that for a Supreme Court justice a life time term one of the most important positions in the United States government that it should require 60 votes because that would make it bipartisan and I think that that's where that's not what the Constitution says it doesn't say that it require 60 votes it says that it requires 51 votes it's the Democrats who are insisting on 60 votes and of course the Democrats newts the filibuster along with Harry Reid long ago so the idea that it's no longer around the table that you can't do that that's just absolute nonsense how crazy are the Democrats going at this point there's now a report that's out the Chuck Schumer actually started ranting and somebody who voted for Donald Trump at a restaurant in New York last night according to multiple witnesses the silver daily wire as well as the victim of the ugly episode the leading Democrat in the Senate New York's own Chuck Schumer lost it at a swanky Manhattan restaurant on Sunday after he learned that a well-connected woman had voted for Trump after making a scene inside by declaring she voted for Trump Schumer allegedly followed the woman and her well known Democrat husband outside repeatedly screaming he's a liar apparently this happened in Upper West Side restaurants and apparently it was the Democrat Joseph Califano jr. a member of the board of directors at CBS who serves as the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare for under under Jimmy Carter so he was very upset that the Califano his wife had voted for Trump and so they actually started berating her in front of the crowd that's how crazy Democrats are going just to prove how nuts they are Chris Matthew at least a guy comes out at show hey comes on the air he says yeah bunker Trump Jared people bitch is like Saddam Hussein's kids ah you know we can't I kid about everything but you know who day and kousei working for Saddam Hussein you couldn't go to a restaurant to have eye contact one of those guys are not getting killed okay these people are really powerful imagine getting to a fight in the office with Jared or Ivanka that they have enormous power and they're always going to be there this is what I worry about for other people in the White House Ivanka Trump is vision described as her father's eyes and ears on the ground that's a little scary if you're just a regular white staffer who maybe wants to offer advice that criticizes the president this is a person who loyally is the number one trait that is that Trump cares about remember people the Chris Matthews over nemesi me see you remember when Chris Matthews I released a memory said Chelsea Clinton and she works with Hillary Clinton you just know you know that if you look at Hillary Clinton cross-eyed you look at Chelsea cross-eyed Hillary will jump on you and tear you throw it out like a dog regularly jugular because just like Saddam Hussein it's just like it's like Shia knows Mussolini ah he's gonna shoot his own son-in-law but only later until then he's a lie I mean like how much are they losing their minds when he's comparing Ivanka Trump who is by the way Jewish comparing her to you day and kousei who say we're literally mass murderers who had rape okay this is how insane the left is gone they've lost all connection with reality so whatever problems we have here over on the right the left is certainly not taking advantage of them because they are just awful they don't even know how to handle any of this well we're gonna talk to some good Trump bad Trump after this plus what's happening in them in the wake of Trump care going down but first I want to say thank you to our newest
