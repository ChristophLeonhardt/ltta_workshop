so tomorrow January 27th is Holocaust Remembrance Day the time to reflect on the tragedy and honor the millions of lives that tore apart but it's also time to consider modern attitudes held by different groups towards Jewish people the watchdog group canary mission has researched some pro-palestinian university students who have some very bizarre thoughts about Jewish people in the Holocaust let's take a look first let me give you some background on students for justice in Palestine it's a pro-palestinian campus group founded by some former members of American Muslims for Palestine who donated twelve point four million dollars to Hamas according to information released during a 2016 congressional testimony UC Berkeley professor Haughton bosnian chairs Americ muslims for palestine and founded students for justice in Palestine here's posi and advocating for an American Intifada a word referring to the violent Palestinian uprisings which cost thousands of Israeli and Palestinian lives we've been watching and applying Palestine we've been watching an uprising in Iraq and question is asked what are we doing how come we don't have an enchilada in this country you would think that with such a dubious background student members of SJP would do everything they can to distance themselves from supporting terror and inciting violence right well it doesn't seem that way when you look at some of these statements holy crap man Hitler should have killed the Jews when he had the chance that dog said a Malta Bell who was a member of the University of Houston's SJP chapter well he did but I guess 6,000,000 wasn't enough for you or what about Ismail Syed Abukar a University of Texas Arlington SJP member who tweeted hashtag lies told in school the Holocaust here's another UT Arlington SJ Pierre Heba aussi who said I honestly don't feel that sympathetic about the Holocaust hashtag sorry not sorry but there are even more disturbing remarks I reported on attendees of the 2017 national students for justice and palestine conference earlier this month and here's what some of them had to say Saint Xavier University students Samir al Hato tweeted Barack Obama shut up about gay marriage and go kill all the Jews halima ID from San Diego State University said we should just stone all the Zionists to death Palestinian style I wish I could tell you that these are one offs that the SJP examples I just gave you are isolated but they're part of a larger trend of pro palestinian student hatred of jewish people and their intolerance of pro-israel events it's one thing to discuss the historical and political issues that make up israeli-palestinian conflict but it's another to spread outright lies and make fanatical calls for violence if students for justice and palestine really want justice they should try to do more of the former and less of the latter for campus unmasked I'm Rob schrab Sean if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
