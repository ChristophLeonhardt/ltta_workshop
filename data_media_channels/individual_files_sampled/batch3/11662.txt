hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report the show that keeps it real so we're gonna continue with a theme of the market and you know following up on that correlation equals causation with all the big banks going down to the New York Fed right down here and nearby our studio here in downtown New York City and basically doing better than all other banks because they have insider information well we're going to talk about the cotillion effect this is a cool tweet I saw last week from a Wall Street drop out one of two can Tilian effect newly created money is not distributed evenly simultaneously in a population it has a specific injection point and flow through the economy the first recipients are able to spend it before prices go up the last recipients get hit with this hidden tax equities are near all-time highs but populist movements bring up globally around the same time bitcoin is born these are not coincidences and I want to show you some charts that he provides as well and this is the rising assets of the central bank's the top one being of the United States Federal Reserve and then you have the Bank of Japan and the ECB in the United States most of the equity markets most of the stock markets are held by the top 20% and most of that by the top 10% and then even more by the top 1% and you see this is the Fed's balance sheet with the sp500 so they go up in lockstep and those closest to the money those closest to the Fed those who get to go and meet Fed executives and bureaucrats at 2:00 in the morning well they seem to benefit the most upstream downstream you know in the ancient world if you lived upstream you had it better off didn't you because all the all the garbage and everything flows downstream and in the financial world if you live in proximity to where the money is being printed the cotillion effect is meaning that you get first use of that money and it then compounds on a rate unique to you you get a compounded rate of return based on first use and time is on your side your downstream time is working against you because you end up with a savings account paying percent or you have no wages or you're behind the inflation curve and so you- compounded rate of return in the wealth and income gap divided so people believe that something intangible like money could be easily distributed without much friction in the economy but of course that precludes the presence of opportunists and Ron TAS and corrupt government officials that would maximize their own anger and iseman based on proximity to the printing of this fiat money I mean it's quite important to understand this because everybody looks around at this economy and they're all distressed about why the peasants out in the middle of America have voted for somebody like Trump and why they are listening to populist messages and and we must do something about it and well let's shut down Facebook let's such shut down Twitter let's keep them from communicating with each other and what they're really on what they're really feeling of why this populist uprising is happening and perhaps it's not articulated as such but this continuing effect where they're getting all the the sludgy money at the end of gone through the stream of billionaires and bankers and hedge funds and private equity and all sorts of connected guys and lobbyists and all sorts of you know horrible people yeah any word that work until quintillion because it describes this financial event it also describes coming out parties for privileged society girls at cotillion you know think it's close to it time how you pronounce right the spelling is different in a stock is similar though yeah it's a bunch of wasps out there in Westchester County having cotillion is getting the quintillion affects all financed I guess big word starting with Q is what separates the upper and lower classes in America well actually Ken zillion starts this it's a freaking thing it's a c1 2 c1 Zack you put those together and you're in Britain and you have a lawyer the Queen's Counsel the Queen's constable Tory QC q see the Queen's consort well let's move on to the next step here in our headlines the cuz we're just opposing these two headlines we're talking about the can't Elian effect we showed you the chart of the sp500 rising exactly with the Fed balance sheet and all of these guys running around New York City in Washington DC in San Francisco in Los Angeles would get access to this money first they they lord it over everybody else acting like they is they are that are so genius that know how to play the market that are just so clever and they deserve this vast wealth and all the people at the bottom getting the dregs of their money after it's been polluted by all this looks like drug-dealing you know if you get the pure cocaine Columbia and you cut it with you know whatever but so let's talk about the bottom once people get the polluted money people have stopped paying their mobile home loans and it's a warning sign for the economy the delinquency rate a mobile home loans has increased by 200 basis points or two percentage points over the past year according to research cited by UBS the 30-day delinquency level is now above five percent the highest level since 2005 the increase in the number of struggling mobile home borrowers suggests that a large chunk of these people have not benefited from the economic growth of the past few years despite the low unemployment level so remember economic growth UBS is saying happened and these people have not benefited but what that chart showed was just there was just money growth that went to a few people at the top go back to the financial crisis of 2008 you know a lot of people lost their homes because of the mismanagement of the economy by the banks and the subprime crisis where the creditors or the banks were bailed out and the debtors were left to foot the bill that's the first time in history this has ever happened a lot of those people ended up in mobile homes and a lot of people ended up in sub-par housing which incidentally was snapped up and bought out by private equity groups on Wall Street financed by the super cheap cotillion effect money from the Federal Reserve Bank now here we are eight nine years later and those folks can't hold on to their properties anymore because of the cotillion effect the value of money has to based been to base and they are experiencing loss of quality of life and an own loss of purchasing power and now gonna be booted out again so they lost their home twice once because of Wall Street mismanagement and twice because of Wall Street mismanagement and of course it's the groups like Blackstone which owned a lot of the private homes that they were able to access their relationships with the Fed and the Treasury to get a Fannie Mae Freddie Mac sort of big deals on buying a vast amounts of property that were defaulted on and you know foreclosed homes but on in this mobile home market you have warren buffett is one of the largest if not the largest owner of mobile homes in america and you have the hurricanes a huge amount of hurricanes this past year harvey ermm maria so a lot of people have lost their mobile homes and at the same time the economy has been so bad and property markets out of control in places like New York San Francisco Los Angeles that a lot of middle-class people are competing with these the working-class people to buy these mobile homes which can only manufacture so many so there is a like complex situation happening here look Warren Buffett interesting case because he's completely hedged because of his relationship and ownership of insurance companies and insurance products producing entities he can be completely hedged against those hurricanes and hedged against all natural disasters and all financial disasters and so he's not actually taking economic risk those people who are buying these mobile homes because they've been victimized by Blackstone and other Wall Street predators have no hedging available to them so America is basically hedged in unhedged country that's the way to buy the population there's a few people that are completely hedged they keep every dollar that is generated without any risk it's a riskless return of assets for them and everyone else is basically taking all the risk and they can't possibly compete well they can't compete with that the you know the fact is the Fed only looks at the S&P 500 or other stock indexes they only look at that and lo and behold those indexes look exactly like them they're looking in the mirror this is like they keep printing money to keep that up they're not looking down there and they should be like oh five percent of these people are defaulting let's print the money to bail them out and said they're just bailing out these people at the top by the time and they're hoping that more and more they're dirty like polluted money trickles down to them but it doesn't and here's the polite way UBS describes the second we interpret this data to mean that these individuals have not largely benefited from these macro dynamics and may also be disproportionately exposed to industries that have experienced compression rather than expansion in the current economic conditions such as retail or some areas of energy extraction so this is financial speak and banks be able to cook for communicating to the herd that they have successfully disenfranchised an entire generation and now they're patting themselves on the back and taking a victory lap and it's very close to in previous societies we've seen the celebration of extermination as well parts of the population yeah that's a little bit over the top but what is simple one could say is UBS has been in many moments of possibly being arrested or it find many large amounts of money from the Fed that caused the SP to issue all this free money clean money to the likes of UBS that then trickles down yeah why are they wait all this money UBS is certainly not going to say anything to the Treasury about the Treasury or the Fed because of course they want to make sure they get ahead yet get out of jail try rationalize all the funny that they got received for free to bail themselves out and the fact that it caused economic dislocation they're characterizing in this rather obtuse long paragraph long-winded they are identifying a genuine situation which is the bottom are poor and the bottom cannot pay even their mobile home loans of course they cannot say it's you the Fed that billed us out it's you the Treasury and the Department of Justice that allowed us to get away with this they can't say that because why would they because they're just gonna be like targeted the next go round to the next crash as we're experienced yeah I want to keep a copy of that as a classic classic application quickly I'll also tell you about another headline and this is this similar case in South Korea and that South Korean Millennials are reeling from the Bitcoin bust the country of around 52 million comprises 17% of all aetherium trading it's one of the top cryptocurrency markets especially from last summer until the end of the year so a lot of Koreans piled in to cryptocurrencies at the top but the thing that stood out about this article in the last minute here is one thing they say about Americans and all these unemployed Americans is that we don't have the right educated population we need to bring in these immigrants and if people just had the right qualifications maybe the economy would be better but this up it stood out to me about the Millennials in South Korea who are have a high unemployment rate their incomes are declining they're worse than their parents generation in this highly educated economy it could be hard for young Koreans to distinguish themselves from their peers nearly 70% of all Koreans aged 25 to 34 have a post-secondary degree the highest of all osed countries so they're already way highly educated and that's what the answer the sorts like MSNBC will say well we just need to educate all these people in Kansas and Missouri and and coal country and places like that and we'll just be fine but here North in South Korea 70% of them have a college degree or higher so they're unemployed so let's talk about education by common sense read your mark twain it's actually about the Kantian effect oh speaking of debutantes debutante balls and all things swishy stay tuned for the second half right after this break procrastinate on some muy Conda cbx public law talk was da nasha nashe who headed the video that my sphere a video should see em you know who your spoiler spoiler which circuit does

into an adult it starts to overfunded to Nadezhda much they to see the period James Dashner reach and stretch need not dimensional check I stop the presentation please be insurance more atoms dealers we have petitions to costless way touch the epitome not on unit characteristic authority so a so-called Islamic civilization generation car tofu one who's gon busily past oh hi welcome back to the concert report I'm Max Keiser that buzzing is nothing don't paid any attention well anyway let's continue now with our conversation with Valentina Lisitsa welcome back okay as I mentioned it's a great privilege to have an artist of your caliber on this show now when I see you on YouTube and I see you attacking those pieces and you're ripping through Beethoven and you're annihilating Bach and I'm thinking you know the the what how do you do how are you conscious when you're playing are you just like unconscious how do you do that it's the same as with a nice outlet you get into a zone and you're totally not there and hopefully you take your audience with you and we go to different dimensions you know we are we're not creators composers are creators were performers but you use all of your life experience everything emotionally what you lives through vicariously or yourself to pour it basically I know it's high words to pour your soul out to pay you have a story now I have many stories yeah but your story your personal story is now reflected in your performance do you feel more actuated I think is a young or Freud the process of self actualization where you become yourself so to speak you achieve your the highest order of your own self awareness you lose fear yes and then you are able to speak your soul out that's the most important thing because if you have inner fear or reservation of something is then you cannot connect with people so let's get back to so political things so when you're confronted with a political kind of backlash as to stay fearless you must be true to your fearlessness yeah it was very tempting you know to back off and a lot of people told me whether kindly or not so kindly you'd better shut up and do your stuff play and then I remember even in Soviet Union you know with all the censorship you know just occur which is one of my absolutely favorite composers and human beings he was censored when he actually histopath writing anything with words because the words alone like operas or songs they would be analyze it and consider it to be political so he wrote pure music in which all the people who came there they could perfectly understand what he said so in that sense that ship was not there you said something recently which I remembered took note of that the notes are basically just you know specks on the page we have no record of how they should be played maybe they're all written before the technology to capture these performances so we don't really know what the composer had in mind beyond his ability to make notations you know speed it up a little slower yeah Allegro whatever it is put ourselves into the music we put ourselves in context both as performers like I am and listeners because for example you know to put it simply if person heard some song at his er who are waiting and its associated with something happy when whenever this person listens to the same piece he remembers the same nice feeling but if it was her that funeral it's different but it would be the same piece right so we all put our own meaning our own life experience our own history into very much classical musical pieces you know why why do we still listen to Beethoven or Bach you know those are classical composers we have marble busts of them they were wearing wigs but they still speak to us for some reason it's because we put ourselves into those specks of black ink on white paper you are a priest to some degree you know interpreting the words of the the deities yes of the creator's the creators and you are and you took the pulpit and you tell the congregation essentially they this is what is that this is the word spoken and and your the response by the public has been you know enormous you're the most viewed classical pianist on YouTube ever by a huge margin and you also have become politically involved and in the in the kind of the subject of political to if you were because you happen to be born Ukrainian I mean that's just happy to be your your your country of origin yes and the pressure was on me as a public figure to speak out you know it's not like I started doing it out of blue you know the first things that happened I was given an interview for Style section in the Thailand newspaper and you know we were going through lone Crimson award races you were so on and that was around just around my dad and then the person asked at me the interviewer but what do you think about my dad I said what I think about my dad and then he I didn't see interview and then some friend of mine rise to me so Valentina tell me honestly do you think of all of us Russians that were vampires I said what what did I say and she sends me she lives in Italy a Russian person she sends the headline says Putin this vampire who came to our country they literally take the words and put them in my mouth and make a headline out of it because I'm Ukrainian it was convenient so at that point I started on Twitter delivering basically translations in use what was happening and stinks were going downhill you know like many Ukrainians I was excited about my done you know because the revolution special events televised it and all you know people unite as one and there is this feeling that some good things will come out it's always a blip didn't you want to be part of it and then you see things that come out during my turn you know shooting killings what what was happening after and then you like many people become shocked I'd wait and I what I saw in the media in mainstream media was not corresponding to what I saw so I started translating sinks from Russian and Ukrainian to my English at that point it was only english-speaking audience you know I didn't have any connections to Russia or anything and then I was put put on notice so people told me to shut up and I'm very stubborn person and I live on the diversity I thrive on adversity so when I'm told to shut up I opened my mouth twice as wide not a smart thing but if you were applying a lot or simpler music you know like rock music or something you could be marginalized a lot easier but because you're interpreting the greatest music ever written and doing it brilliantly it's really hard to dismiss you but I also have millions of following around the globe young kids know through young kids adults in Ukrainian I want to ask the question you know I mean I I'm not an expert behind these topics obviously someone who was born in Ukraine but when you heard the voice of Victoria Nuland the Assistant Secretary of State on the phone talking to folks in Europe about orchestrating a coup in Ukraine on behalf of NATO so that they could protect the interests of Monsanto her husband's lobbyist group and an obvious push east to repudiate everything that was negotiated with Reagan under the Cold War one that ended the Cold War just a complete kick in the teeth to the peace process a kick in the teeth to anyone who seeks to have a more peaceful future how did that make you feel very sad very upset but at the same time you have to understand that majority of people truly believe the West is out there to help us you know it's always in the beginning and only later you understand that these people they have actually some other motives you know to rob you later to take over your possessions you know the countries which didn't have when your revolution cert civil wars they're doing the best you know take Switzerland which is the country which is absolutely should be model for Ukraine because it's multilingual so people think they're unfamiliar foreign languages they decide everything by referendum is direct democracy it's an exemplary country for Ukraine to follow instead it follows different model which is brought in by 90s there is a coop yes the government was an Iowa but by coop yeah yeah yes it's absolutely it's not democratic change in people are used at all this million of people millions of people who went on Maidan to protest and popular government because they love to be on TV frankly no they were encouraged it they became statists in this coup the Ramiro Mohammed bin Salman from Saudi Arabia you know they're openly slaughtering yemenis children he's considered to be a freakin hero it's a double standard double standard all over the place you know we encourage the worst in humanity as long as they're on our side just to help me understand so when I went after Maidan during made an then the the allegedly this group as of Brigade is has obtained ministerial positions in Ukraine allegedly they have ties to neo-nazi parties it is that a fair statement what's going on there you know again it's a question of double standards if something happens in Charlottesville's there are not just everybody screams oh you know hold all trump electors are Nazis right and they don't say alleged or innocent but when things happen in Ukraine and you know as of right sector' Swoboda party is there are millions of those think but people say oh you know but support is really too smooth they get 5% at elections and also you know they're not really you're not allowed to say but for me you know if it walks as a duck and these people walking over there hand up in the air if it talks like a duck and these people talk about what other nation other ethnicities as an Ukrainian being subhuman that we need to kill them to get rid of them they attack Russians they attack their anti-semitic they attack Polish people that can guarantee 'pl so it talks like a duck it's you know substitute duck for any word for yeah yes disgusting US envoy to Ukraine court worker says if two other countries oh please let off the criticism of Ukraine because they need to build this is it goes through this nationalism but that's like teenager years they will over grow it I gotta tell you that I'm very impressed you know again great having you on the show so to give you a little the background of course you you were not allowed to perform in Toronto after being invited there you know for political reasons basically and my understanding is then you follow that up with a with a concert and emboss Yahoo's invite a Troodon boss after I became maturing so you have to get in this is a new crane you have to go in there through Soviet Union behind the frontline Cold War the Soviet Union yes was the Lions your goal from what I should write and this was like my first time speaking it's like Victoria Nuland now yeah I'm channeling Victoria Nuland you had to go through the Soviet Union you had a tunnel your way through the the wreckage and the detritus of a communist collapse to get to Dumba's and bread lines and bread lines and you performed your wicked classical music yes I'm I'm agent in a blatant terrorists because I'm on Ukrainian security services blacklist they have like kill list code Mira towards peacemaker and they killed quite a few people from there so I cannot go to see my family I can go to you know what called it mainland Ukraine because I would be arrested immediately as Ukrainian citizen so I can only go on other side in done bus and when I play there I played the same imagine of second concerto there we are 15,000 people there and you could still hear the bombs dropping at that point and this people you know flag are cut out there because we're at a time but thank you so much being on the show rarely do we have someone with your guts you got guts unlike all these other fingers right on well if you want to catch the other side of the story about a brigade please check out the glowing profile in The Guardian newspaper over there in the UK that's gonna do it for us here on the kinds of reporting like to thank our special guest Valentina Lisitsa and if you want to catch us on Twitter its Kaiser report until next time bye y'all you
