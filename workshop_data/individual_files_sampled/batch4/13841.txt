you know that you think that like Hollywood would start to say like hmm you know all these people turned up is sort of saying that they don't care what we think and they don't care about our celebrities and maybe their trust trying to stick it to it to us a little bit here is a show I think it's from Fox it's called Lucifer it's about the devil right Lucifer and he's a walking the earth for some reason I've never seen the show he's walking the earth for some reason he goes to see a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist starts to ask him about how Hell works how does is there a special room for tyrants where heat or torturers tyrants and here's his response so we can talk about Caligula Stalin Trump I mean I know he's not dead but he's definitely going I owe you an apology thank you

shopping up you know entertain me you know show me show me tell me a story yeah there's a story in the onion I love this I mean this it's almost too real to be an onion Satar says DNC aiming to reconnect with working-class Americans with new Hamilton inspired lena dunham webseries saying the new effort would help them vote make critical inroads with low-income rural voters following a stunning election loss last week the Democratic National Committee announced the launch of a new Hamilton inspired web series Tuesday starring leonard lena dunham intended to connect with working-class Americans and address their most pressing concerns and we're hoping to make up the ground we lost with white working-class voters and union members who once made up our base with a new 10-part hip-hop musical set in rural Wisconsin featuring it down on her luck manufacturing worker played by Lena Dunham said DNC interim chair oh it's funny it's only funny cuz it's absolutely true they have learned it's like John Snow in Game of Thrones these people you learn nothing Jon Snow you know nothing these people know nothing so you know what's going on now in the in the Trump transition team Mike tense Pence has taken over and he's tossed out the lobbyists which is a good thing that's a great thing right we should I mean you think even left wingers would be celebrating that he has purged the transition team of the chris Christie people apparently Trump was unhappy about Bridgegate and way handle that so now I mean New York even the New York Times a former newspaper president elect Donald J Trump's transition was in disarray on Tuesday marked by firings infighting and revelations that American allies were blindly dialing into Trump Tower to try to reach the soon-to-be leader of the free world one week after mr. Trump scored an upset victory that took him by surprise his team was improvising the most basic traditions of assuming power this is utter garbage utter garbage every transition team is in chaos this is a very difficult job they haven't they're on schedule for appointments I mean they're actually ahead of a little ahead of schedule with appointments so like I said oh and what I like is Trump is tweeting back you know here's here's good Trump you know ben is always talking about good trump bad form here's Trump tweeting back he says the family New York Times story is so totally wrong on transition transition it is going so smoothly also I have spoken to many leaders very organized process taking place as I decide on cabinet and many other positions I am the only one who knows who the finalists are so which The Apprentice you know it's easy he's been doing this for years so anyway I just can't believe you cannot believe the reporting here this is from NBC News yesterday Trump snuck away from the press and went out to have dinner with his family the steak house right this is from NBC News right nbcnews.com as Trump leaves press behind for steak dinner incoming admin already showing lack of transparency I can't believe I'm not actually making this up I'm not in a highly unusual move president elect Donald Trump on Tuesday night left his Manhattan residence without notifying the reporters covering him or giving any indication of where he was going the maneuver seemed to deliberately limit access to the media the only way the press eventually ascertain his whereabouts was after a Bloomberg reporter who happened to be dining at the 21 club tweeted a photo of Trump and some of his transition team in the Midtown steak house Trump spokesman hope hope Hicks later told NBC News he is having dinner with his family wife Melania daughter Ivanka her husband Jared Kushner sons Donald jr. and Eric Trump were all at the restaurant with his Tuesday night actions I swear I'm not making this up I'm reading this off the page with his Tuesday night actions the Trump administration is shaping up to be the least accessible in the to the public and the press in modern history listen and so so let me just remind you here's an AP story from last year leaked this is about the Obama administration leak investigations seizing phone records using FOIA dodging private email addresses the Obama administration routinely makes a mockery of its long ago pledge to establish itself as the most transparent administration in US history now comes another blow via The Associated Press they report that more often than ever that the administration more often than ever censored government files or outright denied access to them under the US Freedom of Information Act in about a third of instances the government seated that initial decisions to withhold or censor documents were improper under the law the backlog of unmanned it goes on and on this has been the Obama administration has been acknowledged by even the left-wing press to have been one of the least transparent in history Trump had dinner Trump had dinner you know this is I mean you know this is the press academia ben shapiro was almost arrested they threatened him with a wrestler he used to Paul right in Chicago he went to make a speech they had 30 security guards because you know how much Shapiro resembles Schwarzenegger right you know it's like I have been Shapiro I will take 30 I can take 29 security guards but 30 is today yeah I must retreat they were threatening him with a rest for speaking on campus I do these people see themselves you know they're just I don't know if this was a coincidence that Tucker Carlson on his new show had a DePaul journalist professor on and basically asked her does she know what does she understand what she's doing isn't it time for some sort of affirmative effort to bring people who disagree from other walks of life into your world well we've certainly tried to foster discussion debate and have dialogue about the role of free speech on college campuses the role of free speech in society and certainly I think that this election does bear out that we need to find ways to reach across partisan divides and speak with those who do not share our own okay well fostering a conversation about free speech is different from allowing free speech I have to pay tribute to the lady for coming on Fox News she actually put her saw and Crossing did a great job interviewing but she didn't she wouldn't admit she wouldn't admit that there were no Trump voters in the in the academic administration she wouldn't admit that they don't let people talk you know people are being fired for supporting Trump boycotted for supporting Trump all this violence here's here's Jamelle Bouie I think the chief political correspondent from Slate and the reason they call it slate is to write for it you have to be as dumb as a paving stone that's why they call it slate you have to be as stupid as slate to write for this there's no such thing as a good Trump voter there's no such thing as a good Trump voter people voted for a racist who promised racist outcomes they don't deserve your empathy that's the tip of that I dislike reaching out reaching out across the aisle you're all racists you're all you all suck you know Jason Riley who is a terrific reporter from the he's works with the Manhattan Institute my friends and he writes for The Wall Street Journal his pieces appear in The Wall Street Journal he did something I have not seen a single of the reporter - Jason's black this guy who wrote for Slade is also black Jason walked out into Harlem and started interviewing people on the street okay and he found none of them would admit and by the way I believe a lot of black people voted for Trump I believe Trump got a large number of the black vote voters who would not tell largely white pollsters probably that they voted for him I really do that believe this but Jason goes out and he talks to him he says this may come as a shock to the political left but not everyone who opposed Donald Trump is as angry or despondent as the demonstrators who grabbed headlines nationwide over the past week or the pundits who intellectualized the Democratic hissy fit on Monday I took a stroll around New York City's Harlem neighborhood and asked a couple of dozen black residents to respond to the election and subsequent protests I didn't come across any Trump voters or at least any who admitted it but many told me they had expected Hillary Clinton's defeat no one thought it was the end of the world and then he gives quotes of people saying well if he does this I'll be happy if he does that I won't be happy these are the things I'm looking for Jason goes on at the end of the piece he says anti Trump demonstrations are in many cases organized and supported by people who make a living manufacturing outrage Al Sharpton's National Action Network moveon.org showing up for racial justice the equity coalition and this by the way is a parenthetical thought these are the people who get interviewed as if they're ordinary people they get interviewed in the press he says the protests are likely to continue off and on at least until the president elects inauguration but mr. Trump should understand at some of the minority voters who opposed him are open-minded even swayable they are more tolerant than the Democratic partisans and professional protesters would have him believe that people I spoke with want to see their president succeed not to deny his legitimacy because they preferred candidate can't win it didn't win their keeping things in perspective they haven't written him off as one man put it if Trump can go in there and shake things up a little he ain't got to complete everything but shake things up and make things a little better I'd like that why because they're Americans oh yeah oh yeah they're not just black people you know it's like not professional black people there are American citizens they want the President to do well and many of them I'm sure I'm sure many of them voted for Donald Trump and won't admit it hey we got to say goodbye to you on Facebook and you too but come on over to the Daily wire you can hear the rest if you subscribe you can watch the rest and you can be in the mailbag which is coming up
