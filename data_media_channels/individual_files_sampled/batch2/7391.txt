happy fourth from an immigrant I love America more than any other country in this world and exactly for this reason I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually James Baldwin I moved to this country eight years ago and I celebrate the 4th of July because I do love this country if anything I would argue I love it more than those trolls who informed me go back to England great joke and assume that their birth in the country entitles them to some form of ownership and superior sense of patriotism I gave up everything to come here because I knew it was the country I wanted to make my life in and while this country has offered me immense opportunity I swiftly realized that this was not the case for all because when you think about it when you love something you want to make it better right show me a moment in history well something great ever came out of someone saying that's just the way it is better not change it I want to see this country live up to its purported ideals of freedom justice and liberty for all that I fell in love with I want this country to no longer lead the world in mass incarceration I'd like to raise my kids in a country that does not incarcerate 655 people for every 100,000 does that mean I don't love the country or just want to see it better I want to raise my kids in a country where we don't criminalize applying and use this as a means to anchor people of color to the judicial system does that mean I hate it here or I just want to see it be better I want to raise my kids in a country where they can go to school obtain an education and have an unmeasured amount of opportunity but I also want them to make it out of it alive does that mean I'm a traitor who wants to strip rights from citizens or just want to see it be better and safer I'm gonna raise my kids in a country where the color of their skin doesn't grant them precedence over another and where black people are not two-and-a-half times more likely to be shot and killed while unarmed does that mean I hate white people in this country or does it mean I just want it to be a safer place for all its citizens I want to raise my kids in a country that would offer health care to its citizens regardless of social status and prioritize life or privatizing healthcare does that mean I want to see this place burn or one its citizens to have the chance to live I want to raise my kids in a country that would open its arms to those seeking a better life remaining true through its promise made by Lady Liberty and not seek to deliberately separate families trying to pursue that dream does this make me unpatriotic or does it actually make me someone who just wants to see the country stand by its actual ideals this 4th of July you will find the Patriots waving the flag claiming that because they stand for the anthem and do not question its decisions it makes them a real American when in reality that couldn't be further from the truth history shows that it was those who refused to accept what was deemed the status quo who changed the landscape of this great nation and it's up to us to continue to make this place better by asking the questions not standing by idly and accepting it because I do love this country more than any other in the world if I did it I wouldn't be here and it is why I will criticize her perpetually to do what I can to make it better so happy 4th of July from an immigrant who loves this country just as much as you do
