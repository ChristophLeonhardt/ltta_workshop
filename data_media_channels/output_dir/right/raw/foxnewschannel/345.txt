THERE IS AN EXCITEMENT.

19
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:39,276
WE HAVE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

20
00:00:39,277 --> 00:00:41,712
IT'S ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF

21
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:43,714
YOUR ADMINISTRATION SO FAR.

22
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:46,216
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY

23
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:47,417
EXCITED ABOUT WHAT YOU

24
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:48,085
ACCOMPLISH.

25
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:53,223
AND YOU ACCOMPLISHED IT.

26
00:00:53,224 --> 00:00:54,858
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I AM EXCITED.

27
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,727
THE PROTESTERS ARE A VERY SMALL

28
00:00:56,728 --> 00:00:57,594
GROUP.

29
00:00:57,595 --> 00:00:59,396
I JUST LEFT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

30
00:00:59,397 --> 00:01:01,131
PEOPLE IN KANSAS.

31
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:03,066
IT'S AMAZING WHAT'S GOING IN THE

32
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:04,201
COUNTRY.

33
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:05,602
WE HAVE A GREAT NEW SUPREME

34
00:01:05,603 --> 00:01:08,205
COURT JUSTICE, JEANINE, AS YOU

35
00:01:08,206 --> 00:01:09,473
KNOW VERY WELL.

36
00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:12,376
JUDGE JEANINE: I DO.

37
00:01:12,377 --> 00:01:14,044
MR. PRESIDENT, A LOT OF OTHER

38
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:15,078
PRESIDENTS MIGHT HAVE PULLED THE

39
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:15,979
PLUG.

40
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,247
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS WHEN

41
00:01:17,248 --> 00:01:18,715
WE WERE TRYING TO RECONNECT WITH

42
00:01:18,716 --> 00:01:19,349
YOU.

43
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,551
THERE ARE A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE

44
00:01:21,552 --> 00:01:22,519
JUSTICES WHERE YOU COULD HAVE

45
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,421
SAID OKAY LET'S TRY SOMEBODY

46
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:25,088
ELSE.

47
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:26,923
AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE

48
00:01:26,924 --> 00:01:29,960
FIRST TIME A PRESIDENT DID THAT.

49
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:32,863
BUT YOU STOOD WITH KAVANAUGH

50
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:34,831
DURING HIS DARKEST MOMENTS.

51
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:35,999
PRESIDENT TRUMP: IT WOULDN'T

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,601
HAVE BEEN FAIR TO HIM.

53
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:40,437
HE'S A HIGHLY RESPECTED MAN.

54
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:42,639
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS DID WAS

55
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,039
DISGRACEFUL.

56
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,307
THINGS HAPPENED THAT CAME OUT OF

57
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:45,609
THE WIND.

58
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,177
THERE WAS NO CORROBORATION.

59
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:49,112
THIS IS A HIGH QUALITY BRILLIANT

60
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:52,149
MAN WHO WILL AND PHENOMENAL

61
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,949
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

62
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,920
IT WAS MY HONOR -- A LOT OF

63
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:59,122
PEOPLE SAID YOU WILL NEVER GET

64
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:00,757
ANYBODY LIKE THIS.

65
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:02,759
THIS IS A VERY, VERY OUTSTANDING

66
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,862
PERSON AND INDIVIDUAL WITH AN

67
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:08,331
INCREDIBLE FAMILY AND IT WOULD

68
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:09,833
HAVE BEEN VERY UNFAIR.

69
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:11,935
WHAT THEY DID TO HIM WAS

70
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:12,402
DISGRACEFUL.

71
00:02:12,403 --> 00:02:15,238
YOU SAW THAT GROUP, WITH

72
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,741
BLUMENTHAL WHO FALSIFIED HIS

73
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:20,877
SERVICE IN VIETNAM, THE TERRIBLE

74
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,314
MAYOR OF NEWARK, KNOWLEDGE

75
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:25,916
WHERE, DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO IN

76
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:27,617
MY OPINION LEAKED THE PAPERS.

77
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:29,352
IT WAS TERRIBLE WHAT WAS

78
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:29,853
HAPPENING.

79
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:31,354
VERY UNFAIR.

80
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:34,124
SO I DID STICK WITH HIM AND I AM

81
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,459
VERY HAPPY I DID.

82
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,928
JUDGE JEANINE: YOU HAVE AN

83
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:38,495
UNCANNY INSTINCT.

84
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:40,497
YOU HAVE A GUT SENSE OF THINGS.

85
00:02:40,498 --> 00:02:43,567
AND YOU WERE VERY DISCIPLINED

86
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:44,868
AFTER CHRISTINE FORD CAME OUT

87
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:46,703
AND THE LEFT WAS GOING WACKY.

88
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:48,605
BUT THERE WAS ONE POINT WHERE

89
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:51,875
YOU I HAVE ON THE IN A RALLY IN

90
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:54,110
MISSISSIPPI JUST A FEW DAYS AGO.

91
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:56,279
YOU WENT OFF SCRIPT AND MANY

92
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,849
PEOPLE SAID YOU WERE EXTREMELY

93
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,784
UNKIND TO CHRISTINE FORD.

94
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:03,086
WHAT WAS IT THAT GOUT TO PIVOT

95
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:05,322
FROM YOUR RESTRAINT ABOUT HER,

96
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:07,324
AND TO FIGHT FOR KAVANAUGH AT

97
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:08,458
THAT POINT?

98
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,496
COUNTY RSH

99
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:12,529
POUNTY RSH

100
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:12,562
POINTY RSH

101
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:13,096
POINT? RSH

102
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:13,930
--

103
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,631
PRESIDENT TRUMP: THERE WERE A

104
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:16,166
LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING THAT

105
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:17,801
WEREN'T TRUE AND A LOT OF THINGS

106
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:18,768
LEFT UNSAID.

107
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:21,738
I THOUGHT I HAD TO EVEN THE

108
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,173
PLAYING FIELD.

109
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:26,209
IT WAS UNFAIR TO THE JUDGE, AND

110
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,745
NOW I CAN SAY JUSTICE KAVANAUGH.

111
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:30,647
IT WAS AN UNFAIR SITUATION.

112
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:32,916
ONCE I DID THAT IT STARTED TO

113
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:33,617
SAIL THROUGH.

114
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:36,486
HE WAS TREATED VERY, VERY

115
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:38,922
UNFAIRLY, JEANINE.

116
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:41,458
JUDGE JEANINE: EVEN "THE

117
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,327
WASHINGTON POST," EVEN "THE

118
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:45,362
WASHINGTON POST" TOP OF THE FOLD

119
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:47,464
TODAY TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT

120
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:49,533
WHEN YOU WENT OFF SCRIPT AND YOU

121
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:51,735
WENT AFTER CHRISTINE FORD,

122
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:53,770
SAYING NOTHING THAT WASN'T

123
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:56,139
ALREADY TRUE, TALKING ABOUT HER

124
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,810
MEMORY FAILURES REGARDING THE

125
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:02,178
FUNDAMENTALS OF HER ASSAULT.

126
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:04,948
THEY SAID IT WAS A TURNING POINT

127
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:05,549
TO VICTORY.

128
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,685
WHEN YOU DID THAT YOU TURBO

129
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:11,288
CHARGED THE VICTORY WHEN HIS

130
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,223
FATE WAS MOST OF IN DOUBT.

131
00:04:13,224 --> 00:04:14,925
THERE IS NO QUESTION WHAT YOU

132
00:04:14,926 --> 00:04:17,794
DID WAS INSTINCTIVE, GUTTURAL ^,

133
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:22,399
YOU DID IT, AND YOU WON.

134
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,434
PRESIDENT TRUMP: IT WAS A

135
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:26,803
TURNING POINT AS "THE WASHINGTON

136
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:29,606
POST" WAS ACTUALLY SHOCKINGLY

137
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:31,107
SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY

138
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:31,608
POSITIVE.

139
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:33,176
I'M PROUD OF IT.

140
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:35,645
WE HAVE A VERY -- WE ARE GOING

141
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:37,681
TO HAVE A GREAT, GREAT JUSTICE

142
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:38,882
OF THE SUPREME COURT FOR MANY

143
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:40,183
YEARS.

144
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:41,751
I FOUGHT HARD TO MAKE SURE HE

145
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:42,085
GOT ON.

146
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:44,654
YOU WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

147
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:46,957
YOU WILL SEE HOW GREAT HE'LL BE

148
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:47,924
AND HOW HE'LL BECOME.

149
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:52,896
I HAVE NO DOUBT BY THE AT ALL.

150
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:55,065
JUDGE JEANINE: SHOULD THERE BE

151
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:57,901
CONSEQUENCES TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO

152
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:59,336
PROMOTED FALSEHOODS.

153
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:01,972
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAWYER

154
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:03,974
AVENATTI, THE ALLEGATIONS HE WAS

155
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:05,508
PROMOTING WHEN HE BRINGS OUT

156
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:10,046
THIS ALLEGED VICTIM WERE SO

157
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:11,481
PREPOSTEROUS THAT THEY

158
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:13,183
DISSIPATED ON THEIR OWN.

159
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:15,118
SHOULD THIS PERSON BE HELD FOR

160
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,320
THE FALSEHOODS, NOT JUST IN

161
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:21,091
TERMS OF GRIEVANCES WITH THE BAR

162
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:22,993
ASSOCIATION, BUT EVEN BEYOND

163
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:24,194
THAT.

164
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:28,264
PRESIDENT TRUMP: HE MADE FALSE

165
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:29,399
ACCUSATIONS ABOUT ME.

166
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,501
IT'S A DISGRACE THEY ARE ABLE TO

167
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:32,502
DO IT.

168
00:05:32,503 --> 00:05:37,440
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE OUR LIBEL

169
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:39,409
LAWS GET TOUGHENED UP.

170
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,779
BUT HE MADE FALSE STATEMENT.

171
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,015
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE HELD

172
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:45,715
LIBEL.

173
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:47,951
YOU CAN'T GO AROUND AND WHETHER

174
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:51,321
IT'S MAKING UP STORIES OR MAKING

175
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:52,789
FALSE STATEMENTS ABOUT SUCH AN

176
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,091
IMPORTANT POSITION, YOU CAN'T DO

177
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:55,392
THAT.

178
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:58,461
YOU DESTROY SOMEBODY'S LIFE.

179
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,096
THERE WERE MANY, MANY FALSE

180
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:01,998
THINGS THAT WERE SAID ABOUT A

181
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:04,768
VERY FINE MAN THAT WOULD HAVE

182
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:05,869
DESTROYED HIS FAMILY.

183
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,038
IT ALL CAME TOGETHER IN THE END,

184
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,075
AND PEOPLE REALIZE IT WAS FALSE

185
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:13,343
ACCUSATIONS, FALSE STATEMENTS.

186
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:15,545
IT WAS SOMETHING VERY

187
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:16,880
INTERESTING, AND ACTUALLY VERY

188
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:18,548
NICE TO SEE.

189
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:21,384
HE SUFFERED, JEANINE.

190
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:23,853
I WATCHED THAT VERY CLOSELY.

191
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:24,888
HE SUFFERED FROM FALSE

192
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,790
STATEMENTS MADE ABOUT HIM,

193
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,993
THINGS THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

194
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:31,127
JUDGE JEANINE: DID THE DEMOCRATS

195
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:34,431
MAKE A TACTICAL MISTAKE THAT

196
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:36,533
WORKED TO THE REPUBLICANS'

197
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:37,434
ADVANTAGE, ESPECIALLY WITH BRETT

198
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:40,937
KAVANAUGH AS A SACRIFICIAL LAMB

199
00:06:40,938 --> 00:06:44,007
WHO I BELIEVE THE TURNAROUND WAS

200
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:45,008
YOU IN MISSISSIPPI.

201
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,844
BUT DID THEY MAKE A TACTICAL

202
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:50,947
MISTAKE AND IS THEIR ANGER GOING

203
00:06:50,948 --> 00:06:53,216
TO CARRY THEM TO THE MID-TERMS

204
00:06:53,217 --> 00:06:56,853
IN A POSITIVE WAY.

205
00:06:56,854 --> 00:06:59,389
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I THINK THEY

206
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,256
OVERPLAYED THEIR HAND.

207
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:02,325
THEY WERE DISHONEST WITH THE

208
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:04,294
LEAK AND OTHER THINGS THEY DID.

209
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:05,929
LOOK AT THE LAWYERS REPRESENTING

210
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,663
CERTAIN PEOPLE.

211
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:09,132
THEY ARE RIGHT OUT OF THE

212
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:09,999
DEMOCRAT PLAYBOOK.

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,102
THEY REPRESENTED OTHERS WHO ARE

214
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:12,469
DEMOCRATS.

215
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,404
HOW DID THEY END UP WITH ALL

216
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:17,407
THESE LAWYERS WHO ARE ALWAYS THE

217
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:17,841
SAME ONES?

218
00:07:17,842 --> 00:07:19,709
I WON'T EVEN GO INTO NAMES.

219
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,878
I THINK THEY OVERPLAYED THEIR

220
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,712
HAND.

221
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:25,115
I CAN TELL YOU THE ENTHUSIASM

222
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:28,284
AND LOVE AND THE FEELING IN THE

223
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:29,786
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS HIGHER THAN

224
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:33,289
I HAVE EVER SEEN IT.

225
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,892
YOU SEE POLLS GOING UP LIKE

226
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:38,595
ROCKET SHIPS.

227
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:42,031
RACES THAT WILL BE WON ON

228
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:43,800
MARGINS WHERE THE REPUBLICANS

229
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:46,836
WOULDN'T HAVE WON.

230
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:49,205
WE NEED MORE VOTES TO CUT TAXES

231
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:51,508
AND DO THINGS THEY WILL NEVER

232
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:51,841
DO.

233
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:54,344
THEY ARE GOING TO OPEN BORDERS

234
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:56,679
AND CRIME WILL POUR IN.

235
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,515
WE WANT BORDERS WHERE YOU COME

236
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:01,117
INTO THE COUNTRY LEGALLY.

237
00:08:01,118 --> 00:08:02,852
AND SO MANY THINGS.

238
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:04,587
THE ENTHUSIASM FOR THE

239
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:06,156
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE

240
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:07,357
STRONGEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IT

241
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:10,093
AND IT HAPPENED THE LAST TWO TO

242
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:12,462
THREE WEEKS.

243
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:13,630
JUDGE JEANINE: IF YOU ARE

244
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:19,769
JOINING US, I'M JUDGE JEANINE

245
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,069
PIRRO.

246
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,437
WE ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION

247
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:22,639
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

248
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,673
STATES.

249
00:08:23,674 --> 00:08:24,707
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE THAT

250
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,475
CONVERSATION.

251
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:26,743
CONTINUING WITH THE DISCUSSION,

252
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:29,412
YOU SAID THAT MURKOWSKI WILL

253
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:32,048
NEVER WE COVER FROM VOTING NO ON

254
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:32,649
KAVANAUGH.

255
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,451
THEN SHE KIND OF NEUTRALIZED IT

256
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:38,855
BY SAYING SHE WAS KNEW

257
00:08:38,856 --> 00:08:42,192
MONTREALIZED WITH THE SENATOR

258
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:45,094
WHOSE -- SHE WAS NEUTRALIZED

259
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:47,597
WITH THE NOR WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS

260
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:48,865
GETTING MARRIED.

261
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:50,700
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I DON'T KNOW

262
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:52,335
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

263
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:55,038
I THOUGHT IT WAS A SAD VOTE AND

264
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,306
DISGRACEFUL.

265
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:58,675
I APPRECIATE THAT A DEMOCRAT,

266
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:02,345
JOE MANCHIN VOTED IN FAVOR OF

267
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:03,012
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH.

268
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:04,981
AND THAT WAS A GOOD THING.

269
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:07,650
BUT THAT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING.

270
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:12,522
THE PEOPLE OF ALASKA, I HAD

271
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:13,957
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH THEM.

272
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,160
WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH ANWAR, ONE

273
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:19,295
OF THE BIGGEST DRILLING SITES IN

274
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:21,264
THE WORLD.

275
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:23,266
RONALD REAGAN AND BUSH TRIED TO

276
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:24,667
GET APPROVED.

277
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:26,202
I GOT IT APPROVED.

278
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:28,504
IT MEANS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

279
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:31,774
AND I'M NOT EQUATING ONE THING

280
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,543
WITH THE OTHER AT ALL.

281
00:09:33,544 --> 00:09:36,913
BUT I HAVE DONE SO MUCH FOR

282
00:09:36,914 --> 00:09:39,182
ALASKA, I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE HER

283
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:39,582
VOTE.

284
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,651
AND FRANKLY SO WERE OTHER

285
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:42,151
REPUBLICANS.

286
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:44,187
IT WAS A VERY SAD DAY I THINK

287
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:45,889
FOR HER.

288
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,424
I THINK IT WILL GO DOWN AS A SAD

289
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:51,094
DAY FOR HER BECAUSE HE'LL BE A

290
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:52,428
GREAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

291
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:54,130
JUDGE JEANINE: WITH RESPECT TO

292
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:56,666
SUSAN COLLINS AND THE SPEECH SHE

293
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:59,402
MADE ON THE SENATE FLOOR, SHE

294
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:02,405
HAS BEEN RECEIVING KUDOS FROM

295
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:02,772
EVERYONE.

296
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:04,741
THEY THEY SAY SHE IS RECEIVING

297
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:05,475
DEATH THREATS.

298
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:07,977
I WILL SHOW SOME OF THE VIDEO OF

299
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:10,146
PEOPLE WHO CONTINUE TO DISRUPT

300
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:12,649
OUTSIDE THE SENATE FLOOR AS THEY

301
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,383
VOTED TODAY.

302
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:15,418
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS?

303
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:18,121
WHAT KIND OF PROTECTION ARE

304
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:19,422
UNITED STATES SENATORS GOING TO

305
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:21,758
GET IN THIS ROUGH AND TUMBLE

306
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,860
LEFT THAT SEEMS TO HAVE LOST ALL

307
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:27,163
SENSE OF LAW AND ORDER?

308
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:28,097
PRESIDENT TRUMP: WELL YOU

309
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:30,033
RECEIVE THREATS ON BOTH SIDES.

310
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:32,468
SUSAN COLLINS IS A STAR.

311
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:34,304
WHAT SHE DID WAS INCREDIBLE.

312
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:35,705
I SPOKE TO HER YESTERDAY.

313
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:37,273
WHAT SHE SAID AND THE WAY SHE

314
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:38,975
SAID IT WAS BRILLIANT.

315
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:40,176
IT REALLY COVERED IT.

316
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:42,745
SHE HAS FROM THE BEGINNING

317
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:44,247
REALLY LIKED BRETT KAVANAUGH.

318
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:46,516
SHE HAD RESPECT FOR HIS

319
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:47,350
INCREDIBLE GENIUS.

320
00:10:47,351 --> 00:10:49,419
HIM AS A SCHOLAR.

321
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,821
HIM AS A GREAT PERSON OF THE

322
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:52,088
LAW.

323
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:53,890
NOBODY KNOWS IT BETTER.

324
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:57,760
AND SHE RESPECTED HIM RIGHT FROM

325
00:10:57,761 --> 00:10:58,461
THE BEGINNING.

326
00:10:58,462 --> 00:11:00,863
AND SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE SHE

327
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:03,366
WAS RIGHT ON EVERY OTHER SUBJECT

328
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,667
INCLUDING OUTSIDE INFLUENCES

329
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:05,668
THAT CAME IN.

330
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:07,537
IN THE END SHE WENT THROUGH

331
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:09,305
PROBABLY AS CAREFULLY AS

332
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:11,708
ANYBODY, HE WENT THROUGH EVERY

333
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,276
PAPER, EVERY DOCUMENT, AND I

334
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:16,446
THOUGHT HER STATEMENTS YESTERDAY

335
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:18,114
WERE ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.

336
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:20,149
WE ARE VERY PROUD OF HER.

337
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,286
SHE IS MORE POPULAR NOW THAN SHE

338
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:24,120
HAS EVER BEEN.

339
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:26,990
SHE IS MORE POPULAR NOW AND SHE

340
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:28,591
HAS EVER BEEN.

341
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:30,560
JUDGE JEANINE: ONE OF THE THINGS

342
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:32,662
SHE REFERENCED WAS THERE WAS

343
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:36,265
DARK MONEY, DARK MONEY OPPOSING

344
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,433
THIS KAVANAUGH NOMINATION.

345
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:40,069
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE MEANT BY

346
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,403
THAT?

347
00:11:40,404 --> 00:11:42,839
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I THINK I WOULD

348
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,374
RATHER LET HER EXPLAIN IT.

349
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,142
BUT IT'S SERIOUS THING GOING ON

350
00:11:46,143 --> 00:11:48,277
WITH RESPECT TO THIS NOMINATION.

351
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:51,414
AND THE DEMOCRATS KNOW HE'S SO

352
00:11:51,415 --> 00:11:54,350
GOOD THEY JUST DIDN'T WANT HIM

353
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:54,650
THERE.

354
00:11:54,651 --> 00:11:56,386
THEY WOULD HAVE FOUGHT OTHERS

355
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:56,819
ALSO.

356
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,889
BUT THEY DID NOT WANT HIM THERE.

357
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,724
AND HE'S CENTRAL CASTING.

358
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:03,893
THIS IS A MAN WHO WAS BORN FOR

359
00:12:03,894 --> 00:12:04,627
THE POSITION.

360
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:06,863
I HEARD HIS NAME 10 YEARS AGO

361
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:08,931
THEY USED TO TALK ABOUT HE'LL

362
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:10,600
SOME DAY BE A SUPREME COURT

363
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:11,167
JUSTICE.

364
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:12,969
THAT WAS LONG BEFORE I THOUGHT

365
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,237
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

366
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:16,039
I USED TO HEAR HIS NAME AS

367
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,673
SOMEBODY WHO SHOULD BE ON THE

368
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:18,474
SUPREME COURT.

369
00:12:18,475 --> 00:12:19,942
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID.

370
00:12:19,943 --> 00:12:22,545
I PUT HIM ON THE SUPREME COURT.

371
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:26,349
I THINK IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR OUR

372
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:26,816
COUNTRY.

373
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:28,151
JUDGE JEANINE: A LOT OF THE

374
00:12:28,152 --> 00:12:30,219
PEOPLE ARE SHARING IN THIS

375
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,087
CELEBRATION.

376
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:32,889
WHEN YOU SPOKE TO HIM, DO YOU

377
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,392
THINK IT WAS BITTER SWEET FOR

378
00:12:36,393 --> 00:12:36,659
HIM?

379
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,795
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I KNOW THIS.

380
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:41,330
IT WAS GOING TO BE VERY EASY.

381
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:43,633
I PICKED HIM ALSO FOR THIS

382
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:44,600
REASON.

383
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:47,403
I SAID THIS MAN IS SO GOOD IN HE

384
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:50,873
WAY, ON A PERSONAL BASIS,

385
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:52,809
INTELLECTUAL BASIS, SCHOLARLY

386
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,678
BASIS, THE HIGHEST GRADE, FIRST

387
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,846
IN HIS CLASS.

388
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:59,949
I SAID THIS WILL BE AN EASY ONE.

389
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,818
THEY FABRICATED STORIES ABOUT

390
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:03,719
HIM TO LOOK AS BAD PASS

391
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,153
POSSIBLE.

392
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:08,958
THEY ARE FAB -- AS BAD AS

393
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,259
POSSIBLE.

394
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,429
IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT.

395
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,332
YOU CAN SAY I STUCK IT OUT.

396
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,001
BUT HE STUCK IT OUT ALSO.

397
00:13:19,002 --> 00:13:21,671
WHAT THEY DID TO HIM AND HIS

398
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:23,005
FAMILY WAS HORRIBLE.

399
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:25,141
JUDGE JEANINE: IT'S A TOUGH

400
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:26,909
THING, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE

401
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,944
LITTLE GIRLS.

402
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:29,745
I WANT TO MOVE ON TO TALK ABOUT

403
00:13:29,746 --> 00:13:31,514
WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT AT THE

404
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:32,248
RALLY.

405
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:35,218
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 6th

406
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:37,086
BRANCH OF THE ARMED FORCES.

407
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:37,920
THE SPACE FORCE.

408
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:40,323
WHAT IS THE SPACE FORCE?

409
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:41,991
PRESIDENT TRUMP: AS WE ADVANCE,

410
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:43,960
SPACE IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE

411
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:45,795
IMPORTANT FOR DEFENSE.

412
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:48,364
THAT MEANS DEFENSE AND OFFENSE.

413
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:50,099
IF IT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE

414
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,504
AIR FORCE OR ONE OF

415
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:54,537
AIR FORCE OR ONE -F

416
00:13:54,538 --> 00:13:55,838
AIR FORCE OR ONE -- OR ONE OF

417
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,174
OUR OTHER FORCES, IT WILL NEVER

418
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:59,509
BE UP FRONT.

419
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,544
IT NEEDS ITS OWN IDENTITIES.

420
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:03,713
SO MUCH OF OUR DEFENSE AND

421
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:05,248
OFFENSE WILL BE RELATED TO

422
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:05,548
SPACE.

423
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:07,316
SO WE ARE SETTING UP A NEW

424
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:09,418
BRANCH OF THE ARMED FORCES

425
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:11,487
TAKING PLACE VERY RAPIDLY.

426
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:14,757
EVERYBODY AGREES WITH IT.

427
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:17,994
JUDGE JEANINE: IF MELANIA WHO

428
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:22,198

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:33,676
HER.

437
00:14:33,677 --> 00:14:35,545
TODAY SHE WAS AT THE PYRAMIDS.

438
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:38,781
AND SHE IS COMING HOME.

439
00:14:38,782 --> 00:14:41,717

TOMORROW MORNING.

SHE IS A GREAT FIRST LADY.

447
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:50,026
SHE IS REPRESENTING OUR COUNTRY

448
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:50,960
VERY WELL.

449
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:55,398
PEOPLE LOVE MELANIA AND I'M

450
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,166
PROUD OF HER.

451
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,101
JUDGE JEANINE: YOUR NUMBERS ARE

452
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:00,570
GOING UP, BUT HER NUMBERS ARE

453
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:01,904
EVEN HIGHER.

454
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:05,441
SHE IS A CLASSY FIRST LADY.

455
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:07,043
IT'S ALWAYS GREAT LOOK AT HER

456
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:09,312
AND LISTENING TO HER.

457
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:11,113
YOU HAVE A LOT TO CELEBRATE

458
00:15:11,114 --> 00:15:11,681
TONIGHT.

459
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:13,816
I AM HOPING AS WE GO THROUGH THE

460
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:16,018
MID-TERM THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO

461
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:23,426
GET THE RESULTS OF THIS

462
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:25,228
SUCCESSFUL -- I SUSPECT THE

463
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:26,829
DEMOCRATIC ANGER WILL BE OUT

464
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,264
THERE, TOO.

465
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:30,900
LAST QUESTION, WHICH ONE WINS?

466
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:32,868
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I THINK THE

467
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:36,606
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO DO VERY

468
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:37,673
WELL.

469
00:15:37,674 --> 00:15:41,010
WE HAVE THESE TINY MAJORITIES.

470
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:42,912
IF SOMEBODY CATCHES A COLD, WE

471
00:15:42,913 --> 00:15:44,680
HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM TO COME

472
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:44,981
BACK.

473
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:47,483
WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL AS WE

474
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:47,984
SPEAK.

475
00:15:47,985 --> 00:15:50,720
BUT I WANT TO GET IT ALL AT ONE

476
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,456
TIME SO WE CAN HAVE IT DONE

477
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:53,990
QUICKLY.

478
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:57,960
BUT FOR THE MOST OF PART WE HAVE

479
00:15:57,961 --> 00:15:59,028
DONE ALMOST EVERYTHING.

480
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:04,934
WE ARE -- BUILDING THE MILITARY.

481
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:06,669
THIS IS -- THE WALL IS VERY

482
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,537
SMALL BY COMPARISON, BUT WE HAVE

483
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:10,406
DONE SO MUCH AND WE ARE HAPPY

484
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:11,274
ABOUT IT.

485
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:13,342
WE ARE DOING A GREAT JOB FOR THE

486
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:14,944
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND IT'S MY

487
00:16:14,945 --> 00:16:16,112
HONOR TO DO THAT.

488
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:18,814
