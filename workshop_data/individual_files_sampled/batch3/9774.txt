IF THE FBI WAS SO CONCERNED AND IF THEY WEREN'T TARGETING TRUMP, THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD TRUMP. IF THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE RUSSIANS INFILTRATING A CAMPAIGN, THEN WHY NOT TRY TO STOP IT? WHY NOT TELL TRUMP? WELL, THE ANSWER IS PERFECTLY CLEAR. TO ME, THEY WERE RUNNING THIS WHOLE STORY. THEY WERE PUSHING THIS SCAM. GREAT INSIGHT. RUSH LIMBAUGH SAYS THEY SHOULD HAVE WARNED THE CAMPAIGN. RUDY GULIANI SAYS TWO THINGS. CARTER PAGE ON THIS SHOW LAST NIGHT, MR. MAYOR, THIS WAS THE SPRING OF 2016. HE'S NEVER MET DONALD TRUMP. COMEY'S NOTES, THE SINGLE BIGGEST UNREPORTED PART OF IT, TRUMP SAYING TO COMEY, HEY, I DIDN'T COLLUDE WITH RUSSIA. IF ANYBODY DID, I WANT TO GET TO THE TRUTH. REACTION. WELL, THE FACT IS THAT THIS INVESTIGATION NEVER SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE. IF WE CONSIDER THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION, THE SPYING, THE SPYGATE, ALL APPROPRIATE DESCRIPTIONS. HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. I WANT TO SEE THE DOCUMENTS THAT TREY GOWDY HAS NEVER SEEN. I WON'T LET MY CLIENT TESTIFY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, EVEN IF HE WANTS TO, WITHOUT THOSE DOCUMENTS BEING PRODUCED AND MYSELF AND JAY SEKULOW AND JANE AND MARTY. WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER IT WITH A FINE TOOTH COMB. EVEN AND WHEN WE FIND THAT THIS WAS HANDLED APPROPRIATELY AND THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE ON WHICH THEY CAN BASE THIS PHONY INVESTIGATION WILL WE HAVE HIM TESTIFY. IF THERE IS NO EVIDENCE, WHICH I ASSUME THERE IS NO EVIDENCE, THEN I MEAN, HE SHOULDN'T TESTIFY. THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE SQUASHED. SHOULD BE ENDED IMMEDIATELY. AND WE'LL CHALLENGE MUELLER TO WRITE WHATEVER YOU GOT, TAKE YOUR BEST PUNCH WITH YOUR 13 DEMOCRATS THERE, YOU COULDN'T FIND A REPUBLICAN. Sean: ANDREW WISEMAN. HOW ABOUT AN INDEPENDENT? HOW ABOUT GUYS WITH ETHICAL ISSUES AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. I KNOW THAT. I WAS A HIGH-RANKED OFFICIAL IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO YOU HAVE A GROUP THERE, A LYNCHING MOB, SO LET THEM DO THEIR JOB AND WE'RE READY TO KNOCK THE HECK OUT OF YOU WITH OUR REPORT, WHICH WILL BE AUTHORITATIVE, BACKED UP, BACKED UP WITH LAW AND FACTS. WE'LL LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DECIDE THIS. YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED MY STRATEGY, WHICH IS THE PRESIDENT'S, TO SOME EXTEND PLAYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IF THIS WERE A REGULAR CASE, I WOULDN'T BE DOING IT. THE PEOPLE THAT WILL DECIDE THIS IS ARE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE ELECTION. THEY'RE SWITCHING FAST AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING FOR COVER. YOU DON'T HEAR IMPEACHMENT ANYMORE. I CHALLENGE MAXINE WATERS TO SAY IMPEACH IT. SAY IT. YOU'RE GOING TO GO DOWN. THEY VOTE FOR YOU, I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY VOTE FOR YOU. YOUR COLLEAGUES WILL GO DOWN, THIS IS THE CHANGE THAT WE BROUGHT ABOUT BY ENGAGING AND NOT LETTING THEM GET AWAY WITH THE UNETHICAL BEHAVIORS THAT HAS OUTRAGED JUDGE ELLIS, JUDGE WOOD. SHE THREW AWAY THE LEFT WING STAR FROM MSN AND NBC OUT OF COURT. HE DOESN'T BELONG IN A NEW YORK COURT. HE'S NOT ETHICAL ENOUGH. YOU KNOW WHY? HE'S A BIG LIAR. HE WANTED TO DEBATE ME. LIKE HECK. HE SHOULD GO DEBATE IN SOME GIN MILL. Sean: YOU SAID IT EARLIER AND CONFIRMING TONIGHT THAT IF MR. MUELLER SUBPOENAS THE PRESIDENT, WE WILL FIGHT THIS TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE CONSTITUTION IS ON THE PRESIDENT'S SIDE. JUDGE ELLIS' COMMENTS, GOING BACK TO 2005 TAX CASE WITH UKRAINE UKRAIN UKRAINE, PAUL MANAFORT TO PUT THE SCREWS TO THE PRESIDENT SO MANAFORT SINGS OR COMPOSES, AND THE HOPES THAT THEY CAN PROSECUTE OR IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. SEAN, I HAVE NO FEAR OF IT, NOR DOES THE PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG. READ MY LIPS, NOTHING WRONG. SO THEY CAN NONE OF THESE PEOPLE, MANAFORT, COHEN, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LIE. THEY CAN GO POUND SOUND. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LIE. Sean: WHAT ABOUT THE SPYING AND THE FISA COURT ABUSE? YOU HAVE TO GO TO JAIL FOR THAT. IT'S ONE THING TO LIE EVEN IN A CRIMINAL CASE. ANOTHER THING TO LIE IN A COUNTER INTELLIGENCE PROBE. ALSO, THE FISA JUDGES RELY EVEN MORE THAN A CRIMINAL COURT Sean: ROD ROSENSTEIN SIGNED THE FINAL APPLICATION. SALLY YATES SIGNED ONE. SO WHAT? SO WHAT? Sean: THE BULK OF IT WAS HILLARY CLINTON BOUGHT AND PAID FOR, FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE BIT RUSSIAN LIES AND THEY NEVER CORROBORATED IT. I'LL FOLLOW UP ON WHAT RUSH SAID. OF COURSE IF IT WASN'T SPYING, THEY SHOULD HAVE COME TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THEY COULD HAVE COME TO ME. I WAS THE FBI MAN OF THE YEAR THAT YEAR. THEY COULD HAVE COME TO ME AND THEY COULD HAVE TOLD ME AND I COULD HAVE BRIEFED THE PRESIDENT OR THEY COULD HAVE BRIEFED THE PRESIDENT. Sean: THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE SPRING OF 2016. THE PRESIDENT NEVER MET CARTER PAGE, EVER TO THIS DAY. HE HASN'T MET MOST OF THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY ALLEGED AND THEY HAVEN'T ALLEGED COLLUSION ON THE PART OF ANYBODY. THE EVEN RUSSIANS, THE PHONY INDICTMENT WITH THE RUSSIANS THAT WILL NEVER COME FOR TRIAL. THEY COLLUDED WITH EACH OTHER. RUSSIANS COLLUDING. BIG NEWS. THEY HAVE BEEN COLLUDING SINCE THE SOVIET UNION. THANK YOU, SEAN. THANKS FOR BEING A PATRIOT. THE PRESIDENT APPRECIATES IT. Sean: IT'S ABOUT THE TRUTH AND IT'S THE BIGGEST ABUSE OF POWER. CORRUPTION SCANDAL. EVERYTHING WE TALK ABOUT DON'T THINK Sean: SPYING ON A CAMPAIGN. DON'T THINK HE HAS ANY RELUCTANCE TO BE INTERVIEWED. HE'S READY AND WILLING TO BE INTERVIEWED. IT'S ME AND HIS LAWYERS Sean: I WOULDN'T ALLOW THIS PRESIDENT TO GO ANYWHERE NEAR ANY SPECIAL COUNSEL THAT HIRES A
