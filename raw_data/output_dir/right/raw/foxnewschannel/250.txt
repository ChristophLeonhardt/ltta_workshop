00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,740
>> Sean: IN AN INTERVIEW WITH

2
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:07,908
"FOX & FRIENDS" EARLIER TODAY,

3
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:09,310
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE GETS

4
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:11,112
ALONG WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN, GAVE

5
00:00:11,113 --> 00:00:12,913
CREDIT TO MARK MEADOWS AND

6
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:14,582
OTHERS FOR EXPOSING WHAT

7
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:15,316
HAPPENED WITH THE RUSSIAN WITCH

8
00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:15,616
HUNT.

9
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:17,651
TAKE A LOOK.

10
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:19,620
>> I GET ALONG WELL WITH ROD.

11
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:21,055
WE HAVE A WITCH HUNT GOING ON,

12
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:22,323
WHICH IS DISGRACEFUL.

13
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:23,991
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I'LL

14
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:25,993
TAKE THESE REPUBLICAN GUYS WITH

15
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:28,929
MARK MEADOWS AND JIM JORDAN AND

16
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,164
GATES AND GIBBS AND ALL OF THEM,

17
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:31,999
I HATE TO MENTION A FEW NAMES

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,067
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY OF THEM.

19
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:34,401
I WANT TO GIVE EVERY ONE OF THEM

20
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:36,103
CREDIT.

21
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:37,805
THEY'RE TOUGH, SMART GUYS.

22
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:40,174
THEY KNOW THERE WAS NO

23
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:40,608
COLLUSION.

24
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,343
IT TURNED OUT WITH RUSSIA.

25
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:43,911
THERE WAS COLLUSION BUT IT WAS

26
00:00:43,912 --> 00:00:46,747
WITH HILLARY CLINTON, THE DNC.

27
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:49,049
THESE REPUBLICAN FOLKS, I THINK,

28
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,352
THEY'RE BECOMING FOLK HEROS.

29
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:52,953
THESE ARE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE.

30
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:53,687
AND THEY WANT TO GET TO THE

31
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:54,989
BOTTOM OF IT.

32
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,690
>> Sean: I AGREE WITH THAT, THE

33
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:58,025
FREEDOM CAUCUS, STAND BY THEIR

34
00:00:58,026 --> 00:00:59,860
PROMISES, THEY FIGHT.

35
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:00,594
CONGRESSMAN MARK MEADOWS JOINS

36
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:01,962
US.

37
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:03,631
FOX NEWS INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER

38
00:01:03,632 --> 00:01:05,032
SARAH CARTER, THE HILL'S JOHN

39
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:08,135
SOLOMON.

40
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,803
CONGRESSMAN, WE NOW HAVE ROD

41
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:11,605
ROSENSTEIN, LET'S SEE, HE

42
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:13,874
RECOMMENDED FIRING COMEY, HE

43
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,609
SIGNED THE LAST FISA WARRANT,

44
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,313
THE THIRD RENEWAL APPLICATION, A

45
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:20,681
GUY THAT APPOINTED MUELLER.

46
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:22,917
THREE PEOPLE SAYING HE SERIOUSLY

47
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:24,151
WAS TALKING ABOUT WEARING A WIRE

48
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:25,586
TO INVOKE THE 25th AMENDMENT.

49
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:27,721
FOUR.

50
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:29,823
McCABE SAID IT, LISA PAGE SAID

51
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,859
IT, LET ME THINK OF THE OTHER

52
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,993
ONES, UM, ONE OTHER PERSON SAID

53
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:35,029
IT.

54
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,496
>> JIM BAKEER?

55
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:36,530
>> THAT'S IT.

56
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,098
>> YEAH.

57
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,134
I TELL YOU, THE REPORTERS THAT

58
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:43,370
YOU HAVE ON, I'M WITH TWO GREAT

59
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:44,038
REPORTERS THAT HAVE DONE

60
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,072
TREMENDOUS WORK ON THIS FRONT.

61
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:47,575
BUT I THINK PROBABLY THE BIGGEST

62
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:48,876
PART IS THE PRESIDENT, IS

63
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:49,410
EXACTLY RIGHT.

64
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:50,377
THERE IS NO COLLUSION.

65
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:50,878
HE KNOWS IT.

66
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,680
I KNOW IT.

67
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:54,748
EVEN THE DEMOCRATS KNOW IT.

68
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:57,351
AND IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT BOB

69
00:01:57,352 --> 00:01:58,719
MUELLER, HE MUST FINISH THE

70
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,320
INVESTIGATION.

71
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:00,888
IT'S TIME TO CALL IT QUITS.

72
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:02,256
WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO FIND OUT

73
00:02:02,257 --> 00:02:05,025
ARE THE WHEELS ARE COMING OFF.

74
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:08,095
GLEN SIMPSON, FUSION GPS,

75
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:10,331
REFUSED TO COME BEFORE CONGRESS,

76
00:02:10,332 --> 00:02:11,832
TALK TO CHAIRMAN GOWDY THIS

77
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:12,766
EVENING, THE ONLY OPTION WE HAVE

78
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:13,867
NOW IS TO HOLD HIM IN CONTEMPT

79
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,603
OF CONGRESS.

80
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:16,670
>> Sean: WHY ISN'T THAT

81
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:17,037
HAPPENING?

82
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:18,872
WHERE ARE THE 302s THAT THE

83
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,007
PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO RELEASE?

84
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:21,842
WHERE ARE THE FISA WARRANTS HE

85
00:02:21,843 --> 00:02:23,110
WAS GOING TO RELEASE?

86
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:24,945
>> WE HAVE GOT TO GET THOSE OUT.

87
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:26,747
FRANCE (SI IS GOOD IMMEDIATE --

88
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:27,915
TRANSPARENCY.

89
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,550
I'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THAT,

90
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:30,918
THE PRESIDENT IS ADVOCATING.

91
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,752
BUT HE WANTS TO BE CAUTIOUS.

92
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:33,254
I APPLAUD THAT.

93
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:35,189
HE'S GETTING ACCUSED LEFT AND

94
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,223
RIGHT OF INTERFERING IN THIS

95
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:38,592
INVESTIGATION.

96
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,227
>> Sean: INTERFERING?

97
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:41,729
THEY'RE OBSTRUCTING A

98
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,696
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION,

99
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:43,731
THAT'S YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE

100
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:46,900
TO YOUR CREDIT YOU'RE DOING.

101
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:48,168
SARAH CARTER?

102
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,270
>> OH, I COOPERATE AGREE MORE

103
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:51,905
WITH YOU, SEAN, ON THIS.

104
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:54,375
LOOK, WE HAVE ROD ROSENSTEIN,

105
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:55,242
OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF INFORMATION

106
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,277
HAS COME OUT, IN THE LAST FEW

107
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:58,178
WEEKS.

108
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,414
WE KNOW THAT JAMES BAKER, THE

109
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:03,117
FORMER GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE

110
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:04,952
FBI CAME FORWARD AND SAID WE

111
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:06,253
TOOK SERIOUSLY WHAT HE SAID.

112
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:08,489
HE WANTED TO INVOKE THE 25ED.

113
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,990
WOO WE NOW KNOW.

114
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:10,557
>> Sean: WEAR A WIRE.

115
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:11,992
>> RIGHT.

116
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:12,726
SECRETLY RECORD THE PRESIDENT OF

117
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:14,995
THE UNITED STATES.

118
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:16,430
BEYOND THAT WE KNOW THERE WERE

119
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:19,033
TWO OTHER PEOPLE, APPARENTLY

120
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:20,634
SPEAKING WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN.

121
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:24,104
I GIVE THE PRESIDENT CREDIT FOR

122
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:24,505
THIS, SEAN.

123
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:25,239
THE PRESIDENT IS A GREAT CHESS

124
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,572
PLAYER.

125
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:26,473
I THINK HE'S MAKING HIS MOVE

126
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:27,641
NOW.

127
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:29,476
I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT CAME

128
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,178
OUT, HE'S BEEN TALKING TO ROD

129
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:32,413
ROSENSTEIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

130
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:33,681
HAPPENED ON THAT FLIGHT, WE

131
00:03:33,682 --> 00:03:35,249
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY

132
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:35,916
SPOKE ABOUT DURING THOSE 30

133
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:37,051
MINUTES.

134
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:37,818
BUT THE PRESIDENT IS LOOKING AND

135
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,953
WATCHING.

136
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:40,954
AND I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THERE

137
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:44,158
WERE OTHER PEOPLE INSIDE THIS

138
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,059
ADMINISTRATION THAT WERE WITH

139
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,226
ROD ROSENSTEIN ON THIS.

140
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,394
IT'S GOING ON COME OUT.

141
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:48,929
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO COME

142
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,897
OUT NEXT WEEK.

143
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:51,699
BUT I THINK EVENTUALLY THE

144
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,499
PRESIDENT WILL MAKE IT PRESIDENT

145
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,168
IF HE'S ARE THE SMA.

146
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,537
THEN GET RID OF ROD ROSENSTEIN,

147
00:03:56,538 --> 00:03:58,272
GET RID OF JEFF SESSIONS, PUT

148
00:03:58,273 --> 00:03:59,673
OTHER PEOPLE IN PLACE.

149
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:00,774
THIS IS WHAT I HEAR BEHIND THE

150
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:01,208
SCENES.

151
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,344
THIS WILL HAPPEN.

152
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:04,978
>> Sean: LISA PAGE, JOHN

153
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,613
SOLOMON, SAYS FOR NINE MONTHS

154
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:07,414
THEY HAD NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIA

155
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:09,416
COLLUSION.

156
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,452
JUST BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT OF

157
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,454
ROD ROSENSTEIN, TO MUELLER.

158
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:14,455
AND PETER STRZOK SAID THERE'S NO

159
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:16,523
THERE THERE.

160
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:19,326
NOW I THINK, WITH THE MEDIA LEAK

161
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,794
STRATEGY THAT WE HAVE BEEN BEEN

162
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:22,796
ABLE TO UNVEIL AND REPORT, ALONG

163
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:24,465
WITH THE INSURANCE POLICY

164
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:26,400
COMMENT, THEY LEAKED THE

165
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:27,634
INFORMATION TO DIFFERENT NEWS

166
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,570
SOURCES, IT ALL GOES BACK TO THE

167
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:34,541
CLINTON PHONY RUSSIAN DOSSIER,

168
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,743
CREATING THE ATMOSPHERE THIS

169
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:37,010
MUST HAVE REALLY HAPPENED WHEN

170
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:39,046
JUST THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.

171
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:40,247
THE ONLY RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE

172
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,116
CAME FROM HILLARY PAYING FOR

173
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:43,617
RUSSIAN LIES DISSEMINATED TO THE

174
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,052
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND USED AS A

175
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:46,887
FRAUD ON A FISA WANT FOUR TIMES.

176
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:49,056
>> YEAH.

177
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:51,191
LISTEN, A LOT OF HARRY HOUDINI

178
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:53,093
GOING ON IN MAY OF 2017 AT THE

179
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:53,761
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

180
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:55,429
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CASE, AND

181
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,197
INSTEAD THEY TRIED TO CREATE THE

182
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:58,365
AURA IN THE PUBLIC MEDIA THERE

183
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,133
WAS A CASE.

184
00:04:59,134 --> 00:04:59,767
IT WAS OBSTRUCTED BY THE

185
00:04:59,768 --> 00:05:01,068
PRESIDENT.

186
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,771
AND I THINK WHEN WE LOOK BACK IN

187
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:05,172
THE HISTORY WE'LL SEE A LOT.

188
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:07,541
I WAS THINKING BECAUSE OF THE

189
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,643
