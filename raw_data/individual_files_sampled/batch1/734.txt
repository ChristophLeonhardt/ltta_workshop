for Martha Diaz caring for her 91 year old mother is truly a labor of love she wants my attention 24/7 she's like a three-year-old Florencia Garcia was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease 12 years ago Martha quit her job to take care of her mother I didn't know where to start I didn't know what was gonna happen I didn't know what to do there was nothing out there she needs care around the clock I cook I'd be Steven I'm a doctor I'm her nurse I'm her friend I sleep in the room with her because I'm afraid she'll get up and fall 5.7 million people in the US have Alzheimer's treatments are emerging but there is no cure it's only gonna get worse because people are living longer communities like this will bear a heavy burden of Alzheimer's disease in the coming decades research shows that Latinos and latinas are one and a half times more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease the non-latino White's Alzheimer's among Latinos in the u.s. is projected to increase 832 percent by 2060 I think for the most part are not ready for the wave of Alzheimer's that'll impact Latino communities families part of that is because of low levels of awareness you have Alzheimer's disease to increase awareness advocates have produced a telenovela style video series about a family coping with the disease but society as a whole is not ready for the surge in Alzheimer's we're completely unprepared and we knew it was coming we've known it was coming for 30 years but we're unprepared on all levels we don't have the investment in research we have a totally unprepared health care workforce Martha Diaz has advice for caregivers don't do it alone attend a support group we talked we lit our stress out we cry we listen to each we help each other caring for Florencia defines Martha's life and that's fine with her I have no regrets no regrets the day I don't have her I don't know what's gonna happen to me a disease without a cure but with a treatment called love rob reynolds al jazeera Los Angeles
