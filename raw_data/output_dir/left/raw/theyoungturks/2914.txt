1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,379
>>EACH YEAR, THE AMERICAN
PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION DOES A

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:07,310
SURVEY OF A REPRESENTATIVE
SAMPLE OF AMERICANS TO FIGURE

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,470
OUT WHAT STRESSES THEM OUT THE
MOST, IN THIS YEAR THE RESULTS

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,860
ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM
PREVIOUS ONES SO I WANTED TO

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,020
SHARE THE RESULTS.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,109
THEY FOUND
THAT MOST AMERICANS ARE STRESSED

7
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:23,010
OUT ABOUT AMERICA.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,509
THE STATE OF
POLITICS AND EVERYTHING THAT

9
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:26,509
ENTAILS --

10
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:36,020
>>AND KEEP IN MIND, THEY ARE
TALKING TO A REPRESENTATIVE

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,520
SAMPLE, NOT JUST A MILLENNIALS.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,300
THEY ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,520
WITH PEOPLE, OR SURVEYING
PEOPLE, WHO LIVED THROUGH

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,520
WORLD WAR II, AND THEY THINK THE
MODERN DAY, TODAY, IS WORSE

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,810
THAN IT WAS BACK THEN.

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,330
>>AND VIETNAM, AND 9/11,
AND ALL THOSE MOMENTS.

17
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,040
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT
REASONS FOR ALL THAT, WHICH

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,900
WE WILL GET INTO.

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,890
>>OKAY, SO --

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:13,539
>>IF YOU BREAK DOWN WHAT THEY
MEAN BY THAT, HERE IS WHAT YOU

21
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:14,659
WILL FIND.

22
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:18,910
43% ARE RIGHT ABOUT
HEALTHCARE, 35% ABOUT THE

23
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:24,479
ECONOMY, 30% ARE CONCERNED WITH
TRUST IN GOVERNMENT, CRIMES, AND

24
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,829
TERRORIST ATTACKS.

25
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:30,500
>>A LOT OF INTERESTING NUMBERS
HERE.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,409
62% ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

27
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:35,020
MONEY, VERY NORMAL.

28
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,200
61% ABOUT
WORK, NORMAL.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
BUT CONCERNED

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,969
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
FUTURE OF THE NATION IS ACTUALLY

31
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:46,670
HIGHER THAN THEIR CONCERN ABOUT
MONEY OR THEIR JOBS, THAT'S

32
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,920
AMAZING.

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,950
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT
BEFORE.

34
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,249
PART OF IT IS BECAUSE

35
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:55,760
THEY REALIZE, OH, RIGHT, WHAT
GOVERNMENT DOES AFFECT ME.

36
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
I

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,459
DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE, I'M
WORRIED THAT SOMEONE IN MY

38
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,670
FAMILY WILL DIE, OR IT'S
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AND IT'S

39
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,840
KILLING US.

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,990
THE PAYMENTS, ETC.

41
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,080
BUT TO ME THE OTHER AMAZING

42
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,709
NUMBER WAS NOT JUST SPECIFIC
THINGS LIKE I'M WORRIED ABOUT

43
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,500
THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE I MIGHT
NOT HAVE HEALTHCARE AND I MIGHT

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,031
DIE, THAT'S SPECIFIC AND
UNDERSTANDABLE, THE STATE OF THE

45
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:25,220
ECONOMY, I MIGHT NOT HAVE A JOB
-- BUT 30% SAID THEY WERE

46
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:31,620
CONCERNED, AS YOU SAW ON THAT
CHART, ABOUT TRUST IN

47
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,549
GOVERNMENT.

48
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:37,750
SO THIS IS A THING
THAT PUNDITS ON TV SAID NOBODY

49
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,160
CARES ABOUT, RIGHT?

50
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,450
CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM,

51
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,650
CORRUPTION, THESE ARE MINOR
ISSUES.

52
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,530
NO THEY AREN'T. PEOPLE

53
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,799
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE GETTING
IT, WE DID A POLL IN CALIFORNIA,

54
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:55,890
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE WAS MONEY
IN POLITICS.

55
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,659
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

56
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,849
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CAPTURED
BY THE DONORS, AND AS LONG AS

57
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:04,180
THE GOVERNMENT AND POLITICIANS
ARE WORKING FOR THAT TINY GROUP

58
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,430
OF RICH PEOPLE WE WILL NEVER GET
ANYTHING.

59
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,170
NOT DECENT HEALTHCARE,

60
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,860
MEDICARE FOR ALL, DECENT WAGES,
AND WE ARE SLOWLY BEING

61
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,490
CRUSHED, AND THAT HAS
DAWNED ON PEOPLE.

62
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,590
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE DEPRESSED
ABOUT IT.

63
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,160
>>AND PEOPLE ARE LAYING AWAKE AT
NIGHT WORRIED ABOUT THESE

64
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,409
THINGS.

65
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,799
IF YOU LOOK AT
DEMOGRAPHICS, THE SURVEY FOUND

66
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,170
THAT WOMEN ARE SUFFERING FROM
HIGHER STRESS LEVELS THAN MEN --

67
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:40,269
>>THAT'S ANOTHER AMAZING PART
OF THE SURVEY.

68
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:41,659
TRUMP APPEALS TO

69
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:47,640
MEN MORE, BUT IT'S AMAZING HOW
IT WORKS ON A MACRO LEVEL.

70
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
A LOT

71
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,420
OF GUYS, OF COURSE NOT ALL OF
THEM, OF COURSE THESE ARE GIANT

72
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,590
MACRO LOOKS AT THE COUNTRY, BUT
A LOT OF GUYS VOTED FOR TRUMP,

73
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,800
AND WHEN HE WON THEY ARE LIKE,
THANK GOD WE ARE BACK IN CHARGE.

74
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,299
AND THEIR STRESS LEVELS WENT
DOWN.

75
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,299
AGAIN IT'S AN

76
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:05,840
OVERGENERALIZATION BUT IT'S IN
THE NUMBERS.

77
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,060
I WAS SURPRISED

78
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,540
BECAUSE I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT
ECONOMIC ANXIETY AND ALL THE

79
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,909
DIFFERENT ANXIETIES OVERALL
WOULD'VE AFFECTED MEN, BUT

80
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:17,529
NO, THIS YEAR THEY ARE LIKE,
THINGS ARE A LITTLE BETTER.

81
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,229
AT LEAST SOME PERCENTAGE OF MEN.

82
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,949
>>I'M JUST GUESSING, THIS IS
SPECULATION, BECAUSE THE WOMEN

83
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:28,020
DON'T GIVE A REASON FOR WHY IT
IS THAT THEIR STRESS LEVELS ARE

84
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,250
HIGHER THAN MEN, BUT MY
SPECULATION IS, THINK ABOUT THE

85
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,370
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS THAT HELP
SINGLE MOTHERS.

86
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,990
THE EQUALITY

87
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,949
ISSUES WE ARE FINALLY SEEING
SOME PROGRESS ON THAT NOW IS

88
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,100
BECOMING MORE OF A REGRESSIVE
THING.

89
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,949
WE ARE SEEING THE COUNTRY

90
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,330
REGRESS IN CERTAIN WAYS WHEN
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

91
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,130
WE DID SEE PROGRESS, AND I THINK
LOOKING BACK NOW I FEEL LIKE I

92
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,400
KIND OF TOOK THAT FOR GRANTED.

93
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,040
>>BUT A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE MEN
DIDN'T SEE THAT AS PROGRESS.

94
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,780
THEY KEPT SAYING WE WANT OUR
COUNTRY BACK.

95
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,780
MEANING, WE WANT

96
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,740
IT BACK FOR US.

97
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,729
BUT AGAIN, DON'T
READ TOO MUCH INTO OUR

98
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:12,270
SPECULATION ON IT BECAUSE THEY
DID NOT BREAK DOWN BY GENDER WHY

99
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,310
THEY ARE UPSET OR LESS UPSET,
THEY JUST BROKE IT DOWN OVERALL,

100
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,800
AND EXPLAINED THAT THE GENDERS
DO VIEW IT A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

101
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,240
>>ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION
OR DATA THAT I THOUGHT WAS

102
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
INTERESTING --

103
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:38,539
>>MORE AMERICANS ARE STRESSED
OUT, THEY ARE FEELING MORE

104
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:42,259
ANXIETY, AND IT IS AFFECTING
THEM PHYSICALLY AS WELL BECAUSE

105
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,699
THEY ARE GETTING LESS SLEEP, AND
WHEN YOU ARE STRESSED OUT, YES,

106
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:50,130
IT'S AN EMOTION BUT IT ALSO HAS
A PHYSICAL REACTION IN THE BODY,

107
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,810
YOU RELEASE MORE CORTISOL, YOU
ARE EATING UNHEALTHY FOODS,

108
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,720
SLEEPING LESS, SO THIS WILL
AFFECT OUR HEALTH AS WELL.

109
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
AND I

110
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,960
KNOW I CAN DEFINITELY SYMPATHIZE
WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST

111
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,810
SLEEP OVER THESE ISSUES.

112
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,910
>>IN SOME WAYS I'M SURPRISED
THAT THE ANXIETY IS GREATER, AND

113
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,190
GOD HELP US IF THERE IS ANY KIND
OF ECONOMIC CRASH BECAUSE THIS

114
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,349
WILL SHOOT THROUGH THE ROOF.

115
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:15,080
LOOK, MINIMUM WAGE IS $7.25,

116
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,970
THAT'S $15,000 A YEAR, HOW DO
YOU NOT LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT IF

117
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,419
YOU ARE MAKING $15,000 A YEAR?

118
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:21,919
HOW DO YOU LIVE ON THAT?

119
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,919
AND

120
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:30,550
THAT'S TRUE FOR 
A LOT OF

121
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,370
AMERICANS.

122
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,310
AND SO MANY AMERICANS

123
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,810
NOW HAVE BEEN CRUNCHED DOWN TO
MINIMUM WAGE, THEY USED TO HAVE

124
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,540
GOOD JOBS AND THEY DON'T
ANYMORE.

125
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,540
AND THEY NEED

126
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,389
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND THAT
HURTS THEIR SENSE OF

127
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:45,389
SELF-RESPECT.

128
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,870
AND CONSERVATIVES
THINK THEY ARE ALL BOMBS, THEY

129
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,870
ALL WANT HANDOUTS.

130
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,909
THEY DON'T
WANT HANDOUTS, THEY MAKE $7.25,

131
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,410
THEY NEEDED FOR THEIR KIDS.

132
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,950
THEY
AREN'T BOMBS.

133
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,950
A LOT OF THESE

134
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,240
PEOPLE ARE WORKING POOR AND THE
MIDDLE CLASS, IT'S HARD NOT TO

135
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,840
GET STRESSED OUT.

136
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,740
I HOPE WE
DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF ECONOMIC

137
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:17,370
CRASH, IF IT DOES THESE NUMBERS
ARE GOING 

138
00:07:17,370 --> 00:00:00,000
TO BE ASTRONOMICAL.
