what is your reaction to Kellyanne Conway right this is an anonymous source this is a senior adviser to the president saying that Ford should be heard she should have a chance to speak and everyone should stop insulting her I mean if that's true and that actually is the truth houses position and that's great she says a lot of things that aren't necessarily following up with any action I'm not confident that this White House actually does believe that this woman should have the chance to speak that said if that is actually the White House position then great and I hope Republican senators take that on board and that they let dr. Ford testify and then explain the calculation not just inside the White House but inside the administration because if you're Mitch McConnell and you're focused on the midterms and you're this close to getting a nominee through what do you do well right now the calculation politically is we need to ram this through as hard and fast as possible the vote is scheduled for Thursday to come out of committee and they're saying that we can have dr. Ford testify tomorrow that means Wednesday we do the quick rebuttals and on Thursday we Ram it through on party lines but let's pick different words than Ram hard-and-fast but from a perspective of the longer this goes and has discussed the worse it is for Brett Kavanaugh and the more I've looked at this situation at first when I first heard about these allegations and it was anonymous I felt this was another thing that Democrats were doing to try and derail it we watched the confirmation hearings be a theater of the absurd with Kamala Harris and Cory Booker but clowning themselves but then when I read that Washington Post interview I started to really think about this differently and said okay there's something here and I don't know what happened on that night but I know in the reaction that's going on right now that for the integrity of the court as well as any of its future rulings Brett Kavanaugh cannot sit on the Supreme Court I think we need to withdraw his nomination which is sad for me because I was an enthusiastic supporter and we need to actually have somebody who's a conservative who will not have these types of allegations trailing them but why does it have to be that black and white you know I looked at Matt Miller on Twitter earlier saying you either believe Ford or you believe Kavanagh does it have to be that black and white can't you simply say this is one of the most important pointment in our government in our country let's just put a pause on it and hear because if he is as great a judge as great of a character as he says he is then this will play itself out why not say let's listen to this a moment I agree and I would just disagree with saying that comlink or a clown themselves but here's the thing we have to examine and vet this is not a question of as you said black and white her coming forward we need to hear all the details of what she has to say he has a right to respond but by the same token he hasn't been appointed to animal control he's been appointed to be on the Supreme Court for a lifetime mm-hmm and this to me is very similar to the evidence that Sheldon Whitehouse and others were trying to get from him on the issue of gambling you see because if this type of thing happens and I say it's a one-time incident well what stopped it what's gonna prevent you from doing it again did you get any type of therapy mr. Cavanaugh I mean so it's not black and white at all it is just that complicated and and I'm not saying this to to plug him out of the job but you're not me cause I got this morning on the radio before I came over here from women victims and therapists and this should disabuse people the notion about women keeping this a secret and waiting to hold it to announce it at a time like this there is something about this type of experience I learned about this this morning that makes it difficult for you to talk about it her coming out 20 or 30 years later it's characteristic of this type of experience women called us at I had a therapist say this and people can google this if they want to learn about this today but the the instinct or the the bodily chemicals that animals have to kind of put things aside and move on to the next thing even forget what childbirth is like right right yes human beings don't have that and it can take the smallest a woman called and told me she heard a song on the radio that reminded her of what happened and it triggered her coming out and talking about it we are in the me to era these matters are being litigated you cannot be a judge who's going to hear these matters potentially or oversee matters that it will have been heard that it be a peep that will be appealed they will go to the Supreme Court and you have a conflict of interest when you've done the very same thing and been so dismissive of we are in the me to era but if you look at Twitter for example when a woman comes forward if it's 10 20 30 years later even if it's immediately after the absolute character assassination she goes through and how brave you have to be to do such I in case you mentioned it earlier but I want to bring it back I want to play what Susan Collins told CNN about these allegations just last night please listen obviously what's very surprised and it's it's an issue that I brought up with him last Friday and he denied as he did in his written statement that's really all I have to say at this point do you believe the accuser I don't know enough to make a judgement at this point okay she doesn't know enough to make a judgement she could no more and I need to remind our audience she knew enough to tell al franken to step down Jill all senators are under pressure but what position does this put susan collins and lisa murkowski and i mean they're obviously in a very difficult position as the to kind of more moderate members of the party they are accountable to constituencies that do want them to be Pro woman that do want them to not be these kind of far-right you know typical misogynist they're also women and you know I think that this is unfair I think we should expect that male senators are just as accountable to women as female senators are but the reality is that Collins and Markowski are being held to a slightly different standard because of their gender so Collins is right maybe she doesn't know enough and so give the woman the opportunity to testify you know give senators the opportunity to ask her questions and to be able to fully assess and vet this nominee this has been a remarkably opaque process Kavanagh has not been a particularly transparent nominee to the court and this is one more example of one of those skeletons that you know frankly I wish should had come forward earlier but now that we know the Senators do have an absolute obligation to the American people to make sure that they are doing their due diligence on this man who's going to have a lifetime appointment if the nomination of Ann is withdrawn how big of a deal is it for the president and Republicans to start over because Brett Kavanaugh was not a guy Mitch McConnell put through and you could love her hate Mitch McConnell but he's a strategic beast and when he wants to get something done he gets it done and clearly they're in a bit of a pickle here it's a big deal it would very much upset the base but it also depends upon who do they replace him with well why didn't miss McConnell pick Brett Kavanaugh well Mitch McConnell didn't pick breakfast yeah why didn't he because he was not the press in the United States - and the president nominates and I'm sure President Trump didn't think of Neil Gorsuch Mitch McConnell put him forward and I also know that Don McGann was a fan of Neil corsets and John McGann is also a fan of Brett Kavanaugh and there are plenty of other conservative judges out there throughout the country who would fit the mold of what would excite the conservative base excite people like me who are no big fans of Trump in fact I actually sync up with Donald Trump most on Judicial Appointments and that's why it's so painful to watch this happened to Brett Kavanaugh and to dr. Ford to whom I am starting to believe much more and more the more I think about it I think the important thing here is there's a political risk we aren't talking about for Republicans which is if we try and fast-track this and move through this as fast as possible and put Brett Kavanaugh in the court not only are we going to have a decent size of the population questioning the legitimacy of the rulings coming from the Supreme Court and the character of somebody on the Supreme Court just like they have with Clarence Thomas really do you like anyone who backs Brett Kavanaugh or who is a Republican who voted for Trump do you think you did not support Donald Trump you actually think this changes our Republicans vote I think it could change a senator Susan Collins a bob Corker a Jeff Flake maybe a Tim Scott I think maybe of then SAS I think there's something happening where people are looking at it but the political calculus is we already are accused of having a war on women and you've seen how well we govern which is not well at all so we can't even so that improves that we don't have a war on women but it reinforces the narrative and when you've seen women come out to the polls and register in historic numbers since President Trump was elected this could be a slap in the face and ultimately feed the anger and retribution that women are going to bring an OVA war on women excuse me isn't Ivanka Trump completely laser being focused on the advancement of women and girls didn't she I mean oh she hasn't German she hasn't spoken up one ounce on this which blows my mind all right mark we could say all day long this is the me2 era things are different look at the women's March or are Republicans banking on sort of the Clarence Thomas model again but it can't because literally the Clarence Thomas model is despicable as it was he played the Emmett Till card and he said it was a high-tech lynching and that was to draw a relationship Emmett Till was accused of doing something to a woman just whistling as a matter of fact he was lynched for it and that scared obviously the Democrats in power from bringing forward more accusers when it comes to Clarence Thomas Cavanaugh was not a black man he can't say what Clarence Thomas said so I don't think that applies at all we saw what happened with Roy Moore he went down in flames in a very very similar situation Don he went down in flames when people voted but the GOP supported his nomination the president stood with him true but is that the question I thought you were asking Evan though and and what I'm reading into it is that the majority leader did not want Cavanaugh for a reason Mitch McConnell I'm curious to know what that reason is it could he's no dummy right and it could have been he may have known about this he may have known about the gambling accusations among other things he knew he knows that there are problems with him so I think that alone is an indication that he's a very very serious jeopardy and now it is needed withdraw they may choose to withdraw him it's telling it's telling the Kellyanne Conway is saying what she's saying now we know Trump is schizophrenic he might tweet something else today but it's meaningful that she's saying what she's saying that this is very this is bad there is the wrong women we know that this is going to be costly they may lose the Senate because of it all right jail you know this hearing better than the rest of us a spokesperson for Joe Biden who is the chair let's remember that the chair of the Judiciary Committee during the Clarence Thomas confirmation moments ago released this statement quote Vice President Biden believes professor Ford deserves a fair and respectful hearing of her allegations and that the committee should undertake a thorough and nonpartisan effort to get to the truth wherever it leads the vote should be postponed to allow this to happen appropriately because this is an appointment for life to the nation's highest court and getting the decision right is more important than getting it done a rushed time line alright I just said it before given what happened with Clark Clarence Thomas what do you make of this well I'm glad that you know decades later Joe Biden seems to have learned that lesson since he was not exactly helpful in the Anita Hill accusations that said it's it's not 1991 the end media hill testimony I mean it completely reshaped our understanding of sexual harassment in the workplace the me2 movement has completely reshaped our understanding of not just sexual harassment but sexual assault and even the more kind of subtler abuses that women face in work and in our personal lives so we're operating in a completely different context now and I just don't see how Republicans get out of this in a way that doesn't cost them I think that's particularly going to cost them in the midterms they might lose the Senate and frankly I think you're just going to have a lot of folks stay home a lot of the Republican base stay home while you will also have a lot of women who see how the Republican Party has treated women over and over and over again who will turn out who will vote and who are increasingly running for office and so I really see this moment not just as important and transformational right now but is really the beginning of a new era in politics where women are truly ascendant hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just
