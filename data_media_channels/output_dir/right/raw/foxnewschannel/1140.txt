00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:24,142
A PAGEANT.

8
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:25,176
MISS AMERICA WILL REPRESENT A

9
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:27,145
NEW GENERATION OF FEMALE LEADERS

10
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:29,547
FOCUSED ON SCHOLARSHIP, SOCIAL

11
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:31,349
IMPACT, TALENT AND EMPOWERMENT.

12
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,652
BUT THIS COMPETITION WILL NOT

13
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:34,986
INCLUDE THE SWIMSUIT COMPETITION

14
00:00:34,986 --> 00:00:36,788
WITH THE ORGANIZATION STATING,"

15
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:38,957
WILL NO LONGER JUDGE OUR

16
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:40,659
CANDIDATES ON THEIR OUTWARD

17
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:42,394
PHYSICAL APPEARANCE.

18
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:46,564
WELL, LET'S DEBATE THIS.

19
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:48,833
MEDICINE, A FORMER MISS OHIO IN

20
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,969
THE MISS USA PAGEANT.

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,141
THIS IS WILD BECAUSE, IF,

22
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,175
MADISON, OUTWARD APPEARANCE HAS

23
00:00:57,175 --> 00:00:58,343
NO RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER TO THIS

24
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:00,545
WHOLE THING, THEN WHY DON'T YOU

25
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:03,915
JUST DO IT LIKE, ON THE RADIO?

26
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:06,551
I HOST A RADIO SHOW AND A COLOR

27
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:08,353
MADE A COMMENT TODAY.

28
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:09,587
I WAS SCREAMING LAUGHING.

29
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:10,955
I WAS THINKING, YOU DON'T HAVE

30
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:13,491
TO DO THE MAKEUP OR THE HAIR,

31
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:14,526
YOU COULD JUST TALK.

32
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:15,894
>> THEY ARE EXACTLY RIGHT, I'M

33
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:19,097
NOT IMPRESSED WITH WHAT

34
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:19,931
MISS AMERICA ORGANIZATION HAS

35
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:20,565
DECIDED TO DO.

36
00:01:20,565 --> 00:01:21,866
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DEFINITION

37
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:26,337
OF PAGEANT, IT IS A CONTEST.

38
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:27,372
OF COURSE OUTER BEAUTY IS NOT

39
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:28,907
THE SAME AS IN HER BEAUTY BUT IT

40
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:30,742
DOESN'T MEAN THAT OUTER BEAUTY

41
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:31,342
SHOULD NOT EXIST.

42
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:34,345
WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPRESS

43
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,346
THEMSELVES, HAVE A POSITIVE BODY

44
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,548
IMAGE AND TO SHOW OFF THEIR

45
00:01:36,548 --> 00:01:41,553
PHYSICAL FITNESS.

46
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:46,958
THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING LEFT.

47
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,127
EVENING GOWN CAN BE ANYTHING YOU

48
00:01:49,127 --> 00:01:51,329
WANT.

49
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,033
IT CAN BE ANY OUTFIT.

50
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,569
SO, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS IN

51
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:59,537
THE 90s THAT -- IT WAS WHEN

52
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:00,371
THE BIKINI STARTED.

53
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:03,608
SO IT WAS LIKE 97 I TNK THEY

54
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:04,375
STARTED DOING THE PEKINGESE,

55
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,777
WHICH YOU KNOW, BY MEN LIKE IT

56
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:07,412
BUT IT IS A LITTLE MUCH ON THE

57
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:08,213
BIKINI.

58
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:10,215
BUT THE ONE PIECE, I THOUGHT

59
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:13,084
THAT WAS PRETTY AND DIGNIFIED

60
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:19,357
AND ALSO AND ATTRACTIVE.

61
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:22,193
BUT, THIS, IS IT THE "ME TOO"

62
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:24,763
THING, LIKE DON'T HATE US?

63
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:26,097
>> I CAN'T EVEN KEEP UP WITH THE

64
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:26,965
FEMINIST PART.

65
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:28,166
THE FIRST THING EVERYTHING WAS

66
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,234
WOMEN SHOULD BE EMPOWERED AND BE

67
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:30,335
ABLE TO WEAR WHATEVER THEY WANT

68
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:31,636
AND NOW THEY ARE SAYING WOMEN

69
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:33,171
SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WEAR

70
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:34,072
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

71
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:36,374
I CAN'T KEEP UP, IT'S RIDICULOUS

72
00:02:36,374 --> 00:02:36,941
AND TOTALLY OFF BASE.

73
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:39,778
I DON'T THINK THEY ARE MAKING A

74
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:43,548
POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE "ME TOO"

75
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:44,349
MOVEMENT.

76
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:46,551
>> AND THEY ARE CASTING

77
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:48,353
ASPERSIONS ON PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

78
00:02:48,353 --> 00:02:50,021
NOW YOU WERE MISS OHIO, AND YOU

79
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:56,895
JUST TOOK THE BAR, PASS THE BAR,

80
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:57,362
CONGRATULATIONS.

81
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:59,063
SO MANY PEOPLE IN THESE PAGEANTS

82
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:01,132
AND COMPETITIONS GO ON TO DO

83
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:03,034
INCREDIBLE THINGS, MAYBE THEY

84
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:05,703
ARE PROFESSIONAL MOMS OR

85
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:06,337
DOCTORS, LAWYERS.

86
00:03:06,337 --> 00:03:07,507
BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE

87
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:08,544
ATTRACTIVE DOESN'T MEAN YOU ALSO

88
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:09,280
DON'T HAVE ALL THESE OTHER

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,753
THINGS YOU WANT TO DO IN LIFE.

90
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:14,121
>> EXACTLY.

91
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:14,788
IT SHOULD NEVER BE MUTUALLY

92
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:16,123
EXCLUSIVE AND THAT'S I THINK

93
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:17,391
WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT.

94
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:20,127
>> IS THERE A REAL RIVALRY

95
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:22,029
BETWEEN THEM MISS AMERICA PEOPLE

96
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:23,230
AND THE USA PEOPLE?

97
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,732
>> THE JOKE HAS ALWAYS BEEN COME

98
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:27,234
MISS AMERICA IS THE GIRL NEXT

99
00:03:27,234 --> 00:00:00,000
DOOR MS USA AS THE GIRL YOU WISH
