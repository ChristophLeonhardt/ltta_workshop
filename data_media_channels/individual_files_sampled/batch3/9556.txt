SENATOR MANCHIN AND A LOT OF DEMOCRATS IN THE MINING FIELDS WHERE I'M VERY WELL-KNOWN AND VERY WELL-REPORTED. Neil: IF DON BLANKENSHIP HAS HIS WAY, HE WILL RUN AS A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE. A NUMBER OF VERY SAVVY LAWYERS INCLUDING JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO SAID THAT WOULDN'T HOLD UP IN COURT AND BLANKENSHIP COULD BE A THREAT TO THE REPUBLICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL. THAT WOULD MEAN YOU WOULD BE DIVIDING THE REPUBLICAN VOTE. HARD TO SAY BY HOW MUCH, IF IT'S CONSEQUENTIAL AT ALL AND POTENTIALLY HANDLING THAT SEAT TO THE EMBATTLED SENATOR THAT IS HOLDING THAT RIGHT NOW, JOE MANCHIN. A POTENTIAL PICKUP FOR REPUBLICANS DOESN'T MATERIALIZE. A GUY THAT WATCHES THIS CLOSELY ON BEHALF OF HIS PARTY, A BIG WIG LEADER THERE, JOHN THUNE. SENATOR, GOOD TO HAVE YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, NEIL. Neil: DOES THIS WORRY YOU, SENATOR? IN THE END, THE VOTERS WILL DECIDE AND THEY DON'T WANT US TELLING THEM WHAT THEY SHOULD THINK. CLEARLY IF YOU HAVE A ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP BETWEEN A VERY SOLID REPUBLICAN CHOICE WHO WON THE PRIMARY, PATRICK MORRISEY AND JOE MANCHIN, PROBABLY PRESENTS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR PATRICK MORRISEY TO WIN OF THE THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES TEND TO SPLIT UP THE VOTE. IT'S HARD TO SAY. IT'S HARD TO PREDICT AT THIS POINT. IT'S A SEAT IN PLAY. WE HAVE A GOOD CANDIDATE THAT CAME OUT OF THE PROCESS. THE VOTERS SELECTED HIM AND WE'RE PREPARING FOR A SPIRITED FALL CAMPAIGN. Neil: YOU CORRECTLY POINTED OUT THAT IT'S UP TO WEST VIRGINIA TO DECIDE THIS. REMEMBER TALKING TO BLANKENSHIP A COUPLES TIMES, HE WAS ANGRY AT MITCH McCONNELL AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MAKING IT CLEAR HE WAS NOT THEIR GUY. IN FACT, TARGETING HIM AS SOMEONE THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER EVER VOTE FOR. YOU THINK AS A PARTY NOT TRIED SO HARD, MITCH McCONNELL NOT TRIED SO HARD TO TARGET HIM, YOU WOULDN'T BE IN THIS PREDICAMENT? IF BLANKENSHIP CAME OUT OF THAT PRIMARY, YOU COULD HAND IT TO THE DEMOCRATS. THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR REPUBLICAN PROSPECTS IN WEST VIRGINIA. THE LEADER RECOGNIZES IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE A SHOT AT MAINTAINING AND HOPEFULLY GROWING OUR MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, YOU HAVE TO GET ELECTABLE CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SOMEONE THAT IS ELECTABLE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE OTHER STATES WHICH OPENS UP THE MAP FOR SERIOUS OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO EXPAND OUR MAJORITY. WE HAVE A LOT OF SUCCESS ALREADY. WE'LL SENDS THREE BILLS TO THE PRESIDENT TODAY THAT CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE. IF YOU WANT TO SEE MORE PROGRESS AND BIGGER THINGS GET DONE, GROW AND EXPAND OUR MAJORITIES HERE IN THE CONGRESS. Neil: THE SENATE LOOKS PROMISES IN THAT RECORD. MAYBE LESS SO THE HOUSE. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. THE WINDS SEEM TO SHIFT A LITTLE BIT. IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS, SENATOR, COMES THIS SO-CALLED SPYGATE. THERE WERE OPERATIVES LOOKING AT HIS CAMPAIGN IN THE FALL OF 2016 DATING BACK TO THE SPRING. AND THEY WERE FISHING AROUND FOR SOMETHING. PRESUMABLY ANY RUSSIAN ACTIVITY. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT AND CALLS BY MANY IN YOUR PARTY THAT SAY GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR ON THIS? I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF ANOTHER SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND ANOTHER YEARS LONG INVESTIGATION. I DO THINK IT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED AND LOOKED INTO ALREADY. YOU KNOW, CLEARLY IF THERE WAS DABBLING OR ATTEMPTS BY THE NBA, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO STEP ON THE SCALES IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OR TO HAVE SOME SPY EMBEDDED IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW AND WE NEED TO KNOW. IT'S VERY LEGITIMATE AND VALID TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND INVESTIGATE IT. THE CALLS INSPECTOR A SPECIAL COUNSEL TO ME, I DON'T THINK AT THIS POINT THAT WE WANT TO GO DOWN THE ROAD OF ANOTHER FULL BLOWN, YOU KNOW, INVESTIGATION LIKE THAT THAT COULD RUN ON FOR MONTHS AND MAYBE YEARS. Neil: I THINK WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF LAWYERS. THAT'S RIGHT.
