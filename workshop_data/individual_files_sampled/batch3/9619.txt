Ask your Hep C Specialist about Harvoni. Shannon: LAST CHECK. BABY EVANS IS STILL CLINGING TO LIFE. DOCTORS REPORTEDLY DID NOT EXPECT TO HAPPEN. HERE'S A 23-MONTH-OLD TODDLER WHO CAPTIVATED THE WORLD. HOSPITAL AUTHORITIES SAID HE HAD NO CHANCE FOR A LIFE MOVING FORWARD SO, THEY HAVE TAKEN OFF HIS LIFE SUPPORT. SO HE'S NOT GETTING FOOD, BUT WATTORE AND REPORTEDLY SOME OXYGEN. HIS DISTRESSED PARENTS BY HIS SIDE. THEY WANT TO TAKE HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY FOR ALTERNATIVE CARE, BUT HAVE BEEN STOPPED BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. DR. SEGAL JOINS US TO TALK ABOUT THE TOUGH CASE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE CASE? IT IS REALLY A SHOCKING CASE, SHANNON. SO MANY PEOPLE ARE CONFLICTED. THERE'S SO MUCH DEBATE. WHAT IS SHOCKING IT IS NOT JUST THE RATIONING CASE. IT IS NOT JUST THE CASE WHERE THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE, WHICH IS NOT SURPRISINGLY VERY, VERY UNPOPULAR IN GREAT BRITAIN COMING OUT OF THE RECESSION WITH ALL KINDS OF RATIONING GOING ON. THAT THEY WOULD DECIDE TO SAVE MONEY BY CUTTING BACK. AND SAYING WHAT ABOUT THE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE CHILD HAD SO MANY INFECTIONS AND SEIZURES IS BRAIN DAMAGE. WE'LL PULL BACK. THAT'S THE RATIONING PART. THE PARENTS ARE SAYING WE WANT TO TAKE THE CHILD OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. KEEP HIM ON LIFE-SUPPORT AND TAKE HIM TO ANOTHER COUNTRY, WHICH IS READY TO ACCEPT HIM. THEN IT BECOMES A MORALE ISSUE. WHERE LITERALLY THE GOVERNMENT IS SUPERIMPOSING THEIR JUDGEMENT ON THE PARENTS, ON THE CHILD, AND USING A 1989 CHILD ABUSE ACT THAT WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT PARENTS FROM ABUSING CHILDREN. WHICH CLEARLY NOT THE CASE HERE. I THINK THE LEGAL ASPECTS OF THIS ARE FOULED UP AND CLEARLY THE MEDICAL ASPECTS. IN MY ENTIRE CAREER, I HAVE NEVER HAD THE GOVERNMENT ORDERING ME TO STOP TAKING CARE OF A PATIENT, NOT ONCE. YEAH, THERE'S SOME INTERESTING CASES IN THE PAST. ISIAH KING WAS A LITTLE BOY, YEARS AGO IN THE U.K. THE TREATING HIM FOR SOME BRAIN CANCER AND HE WASN'T GETTING THE CARE HIS PARENTS THOUGHT HE SHOULD GET. THEY TOOK HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY WITHOUT PERMISSION THEY WERE EVENTUALLY ARRESTED IN SPAIN. THEY HAD TAKEN HIM TO PRAGUE FOR CARE. THEY NOW CELEBRATED THREE YEARS CANCER FREE FOR HIM. SO THERE WAS ANOTHER TREATMENT SOMEWHERE ELSE. ANOTHER COUNTRY AND PLACE WILLING IN THEIR CASE IT WORKED. THESE ARE U.K. PARENTS. IN TEXAS WHAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS HOSPITAL ADMINISTERS THERE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO TO THE COURT, AND PETITION, WHEN IT IS TIME THEY BELIEVE TO TAKE OFF LIFE SUPPORT. A FATHER YEARS AGO GOT IN TROUBLE, BECAUSE HIS SON WAS THERE, AFTER SUFFERING A STROKE. THE DOCTORS WANTED TO TAKE HIM OFF LIFE SUPPORT. THIS GUY TOOK A GUN TO THE HOSPITAL AND SAID HE WOULD BUY WHATEVER TIME HE COULD WITH HIS SON THERE. WAS A STANDOFF. EVENTUALLY HE SERVED TIME IN JAIL, BUT HIS SON HAS FULLY RECOVERED. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT DOCTORS DON'T ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN EVERY CASE? YES, SHANNON. BY THE WAY IN ADDITION TO TEXAS WITH THOSE LAWS IN EXISTENCE IN TENNESSEE AND CONNECTICUT IN THE UNITED STATES. IT IS A FAIR POINT. IT IS NOT JUST THE U.K., BUT TO YOUR OTHER POINT, OF COURSE WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY BOTHERS ME ABOUT ALIFY EVANS. WE DON'T HAVE A DIAGNOSIS. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE PATIENT. THE DOCTORS CAN'T TELL US WHAT HE'S SUFFERING FROM. OF COURSING WE WANT ANOTHER SET OF EYES AND ANOTHER PHYSICIANS INVOLVED AND OTHER HOSPITALS INVOLVED. HOW CAN YOU TURN DOWN ANOTHER TO TAKE CARE OF THIS CHILD? WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE CHILD SUFFERING FROM. WITH CHARLIE GUARD AT LEAST IT IS A GOINGS DIAGNOSIS AND THE EXPERT SAID I DON'T THINK AWAY CAN HELP THIS CHILD. IN THIS CASE WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER. I DON'T WITHDRAW CARE. MY ROLE AS PHYSICIAN IS TO PROLONG LIFE AND DECREASE SUFFERING. WE DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE THIS BABY IS SUFFERING. WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO SHORTEN THE CHILD'S LIFE. I THINK IT IS A SPIRITUAL LACKING IN THIS SITUATION. WELL, YOU'VE ALWAYS GIVEN ME GOOD MEDICAL ADVICE. FOR THAT I AM THANKFUL.
