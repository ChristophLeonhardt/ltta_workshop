>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
IT'S AN HONOR.
>> THANK YOU.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, NORTH KOREA --
>> NOTHING HAS CHANGED ON NORTH
KOREA THAT WE KNOW OF.
WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD ANYTHING.
AND IF IT DOES, THAT'S FINE.
IF IT DOESN'T, I THINK WE'LL
PROBABLY HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL
MEETING.
BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD
ANYTHING.
WE'RE JUST READING STORIES LIKE
YOU ARE.
WE'VE HEARD CERTAIN THINGS FROM
SOUTH KOREA.
BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
IF THE MEETING HAPPENS, IT

AND IT DOESN'T, WE GO ON TO THE

THEY MET THE SECOND TIME AS YOU
KNOW, KIM JONG UN HAD A SECOND
MEETING WITH CHINA WHICH WAS A
LITTLE BIT OF A SURPRISED
MEETING.
AND WE HAVE MANY OF THE CHINESE
HERE TODAY, AS YOU KNOW, BIG
DELEGATIONS NEGOTIATING TRADE
BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS
BEEN RIPPED OFF FOR MANY, MANY
YEARS BY ITS BAD TRADE DEALS.
I DON'T BLAME CHINA.
I BLAME OUR LEADERSHIP OF THIS
COUNTRY FROM THE PAST.
WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY
CHINA.
AND AN EVACUATION OF WEALTH LIKE
NO COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE
GIVEN TO ANOTHER COUNTRY THAT'S
THE MONEY THAT THEY'VE TAKEN OUT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
ANYMORE.
BUT THERE HAS BEEN A BIG
DIFFERENCE SINCE THEY HAD THE
SECOND MEETING WITH THE
