00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,001
THE SIGNING WAS NOT ON THE 

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:02,869

CHAIRMAN, PERHAPS THEY CAME TO 

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:14,947
SOME KIND OF AGREEMENT, AND 

8
00:00:14,947 --> 00:00:15,782
THAT AGREEMENT IS GOING TO BE 

9
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:16,816
ON DISPLAY FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD 

10
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,451

16
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:28,427
>> THIS SHOWS THE ADVANTAGES 

17
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:29,262
AND DISADVANTAGES OF DISSIDENT 

18
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:33,533

HE CAN SIGN WHATEVER HE WANTS, 

20
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,169
AND A MUCH TIGHTER SHIP, SO 

21
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:41,574
LITTLE INFORMATION, INFORMATION 

22
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:42,842

UN IS NOT GOING TO BE THERE, 

32
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,194
HE'S NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN WHAT 

33
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,596
HIS SIDE OF THE STORY IS, IT 

34
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:04,430
WILL CERTAINLY DIFFER FROM 

35
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,298
TRUMP SIDE IN CERTAIN KEY WAYS. 

36
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:09,269
>> ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING, AND 

37
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,270
ALL OF US ARE EAGERLY AWAITING 

38
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,275
TO SEE WHAT THE SIGNING IS, AND 

39
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,509
IF WE WILL ACTUALLY SEE THE

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, THE 

50
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,032
NORTH KOREA DELEGATION IS NOT, 

51
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,400
IS FAR AS I CAN TELL, IN THE 

52
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,670
ROOM JUST YET, BUT THAT IS 

53
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,671
GOING TO CHANGE IN THE NEXT 

54
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,705
COUPLE OF MINUTES AS WE WATCH

00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:46,606
REPORTERS GATHERING, THERE IS A 

56
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,740
NORTH KOREAN OFFICIAL RIGHT 

57
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,413
THERE. 

58
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,247
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING. 

59
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,348
>> THIS IS REMARKABLE. 

60
00:01:55,348 --> 00:02:03,255
>> AND HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT 

61
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:04,123
THE NORTH KOREAN FLAG AND THE 

62
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:04,991
AMERICAN FLAG ARE THE SAME 

63
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:05,224
COLORS? 

64
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:06,458
>> A LOT OF COUNTRIES LIKE THE 

65
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,393
RED WHITE BLUE. 

66
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:13,933
-- THE RED, WHITE AND BLUE.

67
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,134
>> THE SHOT THAT WE ARE SHOWING 

68
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:16,002
TO VIEWERS, THE REPORTERS IN 

69
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,503
THE PRESS POOL, SETTING UP FOR 

70
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:18,605
THIS MOMENT, THIS SIGNING, THAT 

71
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,806
THE PRESIDENT ALLUDED TO JUST 

72
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,874
MOMENTS AGO, AND WE DON'T KNOW 

73
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:24,043
WHAT THIS IS YET, BUT THIS 

74
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,079
COULD BE A FUNCTION ABOUT WHAT 

75
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,912
THE PRESIDENT SAID OVER THE 

76
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:29,582
WEEKEND, HE SAID WITHIN A 

77
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,284
MINUTE OR 60 SECONDS, HE WOULD 

78
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,053
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT CHAIRMAN 

79
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,254
KIM WAS SERIOUS ABOUT 

80
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:38,691
NEGOTIATING, BASED ON HIS GUT, 

81
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,760
BASED ON HIS BUSINESS ACUMEN, 

82
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,094
THAT HAS PROPELLED HIM TO 

83
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:45,164
SUCCESS, HE WOULD BE ABLE TO 

84
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:49,769
KNOW, WHAT CHAIRMAN KIM'S 

85
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:59,879
INTENTIONS WERE, AND IT LOOKS 

86
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,983
LIKE NORTH -- NORTH KOREAN 

87
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:04,250
SECURITY. 

88
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,585
>> IT LOOKS LIKE WHITE HOUSE 

89
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,488
STAFFERS THAT ARE PUSHING THE 

90
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,122
MORON, ARE AGGRESSIVE, WATCH 

91
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:09,889
THE NORTH KOREANS DO THIS. 

92
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,190
[ LAUGHTER ]

93
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,524
>> THE ENTIRE PROCESS, 

94
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:13,793
FASCINATING, THE WEIGHT IS 

95
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:19,565
PLAYED OUT IN PUBLIC CALLING IT 

96
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:23,236
AGAIN THEY WE DON'T -- THEY 

97
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,237
HAPPEN AND WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT 

98
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,372
THEM, TO SEE MOMENTS LIKE THIS, 

99
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:36,282
ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING SPEAK -- 

100
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:36,815
ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING. 

101
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:37,650
>> LET'S SEE IF WE CAN HEAR 

102
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,223
WHAT IS GOING ON. 

103
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:10,516
>> PLEASE GO BACK.

104
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,686
>> WHERE DO YOU WANT ME?

105
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:21,594
>> YOU CAN HERE, THERE IS A 

106
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,161
LIVE NEGOTIATION GOING ON 

107
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,096
BETWEEN THE PRESS POOL AND THE 

108
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,964
NORTH KOREAN HANDLERS HERE. 

109
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:25,865
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED 

110
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:26,866
IN THE BUSINESS OF NEWS, THIS 

111
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,735
IS HOW IT HAPPENS, AND I AM 

112
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,036
SURE FOR THE NORTH KOREANS, 

113
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:30,970
THIS IS SOMETHING THEY ARE NOT 

114
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,338
USED TO, AN AGGRESSIVE PRESS 

115
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:38,077
CORPS, THAT HAS THE RIGHT TO 

116
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:38,677
COVER NEWS EVENTS, INCLUDING 

117
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:39,745
THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, 

118
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:43,616
AND THESE GUYS, YOU CAN SEE 

119
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,250
THEY ARE WEARING NORTH KOREAN 

120
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,084
PINS, TRYING TO DICTATE HOW 

121
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:49,055
THIS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT. 

122
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,055
AND WE DID SEE THE NATIONAL 

123
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:50,923
SECURITY ADVISOR, JOHN BOLTON, 

124
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,394
GOING INTO THOSE DOORS, BEHIND 

125
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,629
THOSE MEN THERE, AND WE EXPECT 

126
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,399
THAT IS WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS. 

127
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,069
THIS IS REMARKABLE.

128
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:08,340
>> OF COURSE THEY DON'T WANT A 

129
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,007
CONFRONTATION WITH JOURNALISTS, 

130
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,842
ONE U.S. OFFICIAL SAID THAT YOU 

131
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:11,711
CAN'T BE HERE, BUT HARD TO 

132
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,079
IMAGINE ANYTHING ESCALATING 

133
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:19,552
FROM THERE. 

134
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,987
THIS IS POSSIBLY THE STORY OF A 

135
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,620
LIFETIME FOR THESE JOURNALISTS, 

136
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,189
THEY WANT TO BE AS CLOSE AS 

137
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:28,995
POSSIBLE. 

138
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:34,600
>> SOMEONE JUST SAID THIS IS A 

139
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,737
MESS OVER HERE.>> AND IT COULD 

140
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:44,377
BE, GENTLEMEN, BECAUSE IT DOES 

141
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,311
NOT FEEL SPONTANEOUS, FLAGS IN 

142
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,113
THE TABLE ARE THERE, ON THE 

143
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,814
OTHER HAND, GIVEN THE SHAMBOLIC 

144
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:49,715
NATURE OF WHAT WE ARE 

145
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:53,252
WITNESSING, PERHAPS IT IS A 

146
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,322
SPONTANEOUS ACTION.

147
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,290
>> WE CAN SEE THE WAY THEY ARE 

148
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,990
INTERACTING, THE HANDS FLYING 

149
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,024
IN FROM THE SCREEN, IT DOESN'T 

150
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:08,634
FEEL SCRIPTED AT ALL.

151
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,102
>> THIS IS ABSOLUTELY 

152
00:06:10,102 --> 00:06:11,070
FASCINATING.

153
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,974
>> I WONDER IF THEY WANT THE 

154
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,077
PRESS BEHIND A CERTAIN LINE, IF 

155
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,278
THERE IS A RULE ABOUT HOW FAR 

156
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,080
MEDIA IS ALLOWED TO BE.

157
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:34,994
>> HE IS INDICATING THIS LINE. 

158
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,745
>>> WHAT YOU ARE WITNESSING 

159
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:57,216
HERE ON CBSN IS FASCINATING, 

160
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,418
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

161
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,655
STATES, LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO, 

162
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,956
A HALF HOUR AGO, AS HE WAS 

163
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:04,724
LEAVING THE WORKING LUNCH WITH 

164
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:10,396
CHAIRMAN KIM INDICATED WHAT 

165
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,430
THEY WERE GOING TO WAS A 

166
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,465
SIGNING, IT LOOKED TO US THAT 

167
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,200
THIS WAS AN UNSCRIPTED MOMENT, 

168
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,535
THE PRESIDENT INDICATING THAT 

169
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,368
THERE WAS A SIGNING, IT LOOKED 

170
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:21,607
LIKE CHAIRMAN KIM WAS HEADING 

171
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,207
TO HIS VEHICLE, THE PRESIDENT 

172
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,142
ENGAGED HIM, AS DID THE 

173
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,010
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN 

174
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,710
BOLTON, AND THE PRESS WAS 

175
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,815
USHERED INTO THIS ROOM, AND 

176
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:30,850
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF 

177
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,551
MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE NORTH 

178
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,885
KOREAN HANDLERS AND THE 

179
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:36,355
AMERICAN HANDLERS IN THE PRESS, 

180
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,557
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT 

181
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,591
RIGHT NOW, THE LIVE FEED IN 

182
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,425
SINGAPORE OF REPORTERS SETTING 

183
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,459
UP FOR WHAT APPEARS TO BE WHAT 

184
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,460
THE PRESIDENT INDICATED WAS A 

185
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,561
SIGNING OF SOME SORT. 

186
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,196
ONE REPORTER SAID THEY DON'T 

187
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:47,867
KNOW WHAT THE SIGNING IS, 

188
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:48,501
ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING AS WE 

189
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:48,935
WATCH THIS UNFOLD. 

190
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:59,779
LET'S JUST WATCH. 

191
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:17,463
>>> THAT WAS A REMARKABLE 

192
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,299
MOMENT, WHATEVER THAT NORTH 

193
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,468
KOREAN OFFICIAL DID, THAT IS 

194
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,570
THE PEN FOR CHAIRMAN KIM, HE 

195
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,374
DID NOT TOUCH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

196
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,809
PEN, THE LEFT SIDE OF THE 

197
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:40,152
SCREEN. 

198
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,120
SO WE ARE IN COMMUNICATIONS 

199
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,721
WITH ZEKE MILLER, THE 

200
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,721
ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTER, 

201
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:43,789
TRAVELING WITH THE DELEGATION 

202
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,793
THERE, AND SEEK IS IN THIS 

203
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,094
ROOM, A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH, 

204
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:52,831
WHERE THE PRESS CAN STAND, IF 

205
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,467
YOU HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR THE 

206
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,635
LAST 10 MINUTES OR SO, YOU CAN 

207
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,136
SEE THE NORTH KOREANS WERE 

208
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:01,940
BEING AGGRESSIVE, THE PRESS CAN 

209
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,910
STAND AS THE PRESS ALWAYS 

210
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:11,651
STUDIES THAT IS WHAT WE DO, WE 

211
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,019
WOULD BE REPORTERS, A LOT OF 

212
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,887
JOSTLING, HANDWAVING, AND SORT 

213
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:19,392
OF FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE 

214
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,293
INTERESTED IN HOW THE SAUSAGE 

215
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:25,898
OF NEWS IS MADE, THE TWO 

216
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,932
LEADERS THAT WILL WALK OUT, THE 

217
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:31,370
MOMENTS THAT HAPPEN BEFORE, AND 

218
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,471
HERE COMES THE NORTH KOREAN 

219
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:32,838
OFFICIAL AGAIN. 

220
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,040
>> A LITTLE BIT MORE FRUSTRATED 

221
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,612
THIS TIME.

222
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,646
>> REMEMBER, THIS GUY, HIS JOB, 

223
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,348
IF IS ONE JOB IS TO KEEP THE 

224
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,683
REPORTERS PAST DAY CERTAIN 

225
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,550
LINE, GIVEN THE REGIME AND WHAT 

226
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,517
THEY DO TO PEOPLE. 

227
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:56,495
EXACTLY, BETTER GET IT RIGHT.

228
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,763
>> THIS IS A REMARKABLE MOMENT, 

229
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,365
CLEARLY UNSCRIPTED, WHAT DO YOU 

230
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,201
THINK THAT XI JINGPING IS 

231
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,636
THINKING AS HE'S WATCHING THIS 

232
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:03,903
ON CBSN? 

233
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,039
>> I'M SURE HE IS A BIG FAN, HE 

234
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:13,512
IS PROBABLY -- >> DO YOU THINK 

235
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,480
HE KNOWS WHAT THIS COULD BE? 

236
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,082
>> I DON'T THINK HE DOES, 

237
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,249
YOU'VE GOT TO IMAGINE THAT 

238
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,786
SOMEBODY IS BUGGING THESE 

239
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,154
ROOMS, WHETHER IT IS SINGAPORE, 

240
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,890
AMERICA, NORTH KOREA, CHINESE, 

241
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,459
THAT PEOPLE HAVE YEARS INSIDE 

242
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,029
THIS BUILDING, IT OBVIOUSLY -- 

243
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,229
IT ALMOST FEELS TO OBVIOUS NOT 

244
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:35,467
TO, I THINK IF HE AND KIM JONG-

245
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:40,673
UN HAD PLANNED BEFORE HAND WHAT 

246
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,873
-- HOW MUCH ROPE HE WAS ALLOWED 

247
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:44,643
TO GIVE, FROM CHINA, THEY HAD 

248
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:45,511
DISCUSSED BEFORE HAND, WHAT HE 

249
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,512
WAS ALLOWED TO GIVE, THEN 

250
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,815
PERHAPS HE DOES KNOW, AND 

251
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,849
PERHAPS HE IS A BIT NERVOUS 

252
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:54,986
WHETHER OR NOT KIM WILL FOLLOW 

253
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:56,088
THE ORDERS WHICH HE SAID FOR 

254
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:56,254
<font color="#FF0000">IM. </font>

255
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:57,623
>> THAT IS REMARKABLE, AS WE 

256
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,892
DISCUSSED EARLIER, THE NORTH 

257
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:03,295
KOREANS MET WITH CHAIRMAN KIM, 

258
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,799
MEETING WITH XI JINGPING, OVER 

259
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,769
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS,  ONE 

260
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,337
WOULD HAVE TO WONDER IF THERE 

261
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,273
WERE INSTRUCTIONS, OR GUIDANCE, 

262
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,474
AS TO WHAT THEY COULD AND COULD 

263
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:21,113
NOT ACCEPT, AS FAR AS WHAT THE 

264
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,180
U.S. DEMANDS WERE, AND THIS MAY 

265
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,482
BE A MOMENT WE ARE SINGING -- 

266
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,617
WE ARE SEEING THAT THE CHINESE 

267
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:26,619
ARE NOT EXPECTING. 

268
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:32,123
>> PROBABLY FOR XI JINGPING, 

269
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:33,159
YOU WANTED THIS TO GO AS 

270
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,826
QUICKLY AND SMOOTHLY AS 

271
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,693
POSSIBLE, WITH NO SURPRISES,  

272
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,094
IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A PRETTY 

273
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:38,097
BIG CURVEBALL HERE, IF VIEWERS 

274
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:44,837
HAD NOT SEEN THE PICTURE OF 

275
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,571
KIM, TRUMP AND BOLTON PRODDING 

276
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,138
EACH OTHER EARLIER, TOTALLY 

277
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:46,872
UNSCRIPTED IT SEEMS, THAT SEEMS 

278
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,107
TO HAVE LED TO THIS ROOM WHERE 

279
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,376
THE PRESS HAS BEEN USHERED 

280
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:50,576
INTO. 

281
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:56,048
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS WAS NOT 

282
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:56,916
EXPECTED, FOR XI JINGPING, FOR 

283
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,817
KIM JONG-UN, AND PRESIDENT 

284
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,617
TRUMP, IT IS HARD TO KNOW. 

285
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:04,456
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE THE 

286
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:05,156
CONSTERNATION THAT IS HAPPENING 

287
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:06,192
IN TOKYO AT THIS MOMENT, IN 

288
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,962
SEOUL, AND BEIJING, AS THEY SIT 

289
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:10,830
HERE WATCHING WHAT WE ARE 

290
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,264
SEEING IN FULL BEFORE HER EYES, 

291
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,968
WONDERING WHAT IS GOING ON. 

292
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,036
WE COULD BE WRONG, EVERYONE IS 

293
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,003
ON THE SAME PAGE, AND EVERYONE 

294
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:18,870
KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, 

295
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,738
BUT GIVEN WHAT WE'VE SEEN, 

296
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:24,543
SURMISING BASED ON JUST THE 

297
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,578
NATURE OF WHAT WE HAVE JUST 

298
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,113
WITNESSED OVER THE LAST HALF 

299
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,115
HOUR, PHONE CALLS HAPPENING, 

300
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:32,485
WHAT IS GOING ON, WHAT ARE YOU 

301
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,085
DOING, WHAT IS THE SIGNING? 

302
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:33,885
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 

303
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:35,054
IT, AND HERE WE ARE. 

304
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,856
>> THE DRUM AT THESE MOMENTS IS 

305
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,057
INCREDIBLE. 

306
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,792
THE TENSION OF HAVING THE NORTH 

307
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,294
KOREAN GUARD GO AND CLEAN THE 

308
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,097
PEN. 

309
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:45,931
THAT KIM JONG-UN PRESUMABLY IS 

310
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,433
GOING TO SIGN SOMETHING, 

311
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,334
WHETTING OUR APPETITE FOR 

312
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:50,903
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT IS GOING 

313
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:57,076
TO HAPPEN.

314
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:57,810
>> AND IF INDEED THIS WAS 

315
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,878
SOMETHING THAT WAS PERHAPS NOT 

316
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:06,986
PLANNED, THE QUESTION BECOMES 

317
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,020
OF COURSE, THIS WOULD BE 

318
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,188
SOMETHING THAT IS PLANNED BY 

319
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:09,655
THE U.S., BUT NOT IN 

320
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,856
CONJUNCTION WITH THE NORTH 

321
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:14,660
KOREANS, THE PRESIDENT JUST 

322
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,694
MADE THIS COMMENT, EVERYBODY 

323
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:16,361
LOOKED AROUND AND SAID WHAT IS 

324
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:17,862
HE TALKING ABOUT, AND HERE WE 

325
00:13:17,862 --> 00:13:20,699
ARE, AND SO NOT WANTING TO LOSE 

326
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,201
FACE IS ONE THING, FROM 

327
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,468
CHAIRMAN KIM, BUT SIGNING 

328
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:25,971
SOMETHING, IS A WHOLE ANOTHER 

329
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,375
KIT AND CABOODLE. 

330
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,377
>> TRUMP DREW A LOT OF FLAK FOR 

331
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:33,011
HIS COMMENTS ABOUT I WILL KNOW 

332
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,580
IN A MINUTE HOW I FEEL ABOUT 

333
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,481
KIM JONG-UN, BUT MOMENTS LIKE 

334
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,885
THESE ARE A REPORT -- IMPORTANT 

335
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:40,485
REMINDER THAT THESE PRECIOUS 

336
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,655
MOMENTS DO REALLY MATTER.

337
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,689
>> WE WILL RECALL THAT THE 

338
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:44,990
PRESIDENT SIX MONTHS AGO 

339
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,927
REMINDED US, THE WORLD, THAT 

340
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:48,961
HIS NUCLEAR BUTTON WAS MUCH 

341
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,797
BIGGER THAN CHAIRMAN KIM'S 

342
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,831
NUCLEAR BUTTON, AND HERE WE ARE 

343
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,734
NOW, THIS HISTORIC MOMENT, 

344
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:56,602
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

345
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,469
UNITED STATES AND THE DICTATOR 

346
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:01,740
OF NORTH KOREA, KIM JONG-UN, 

347
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,608
AFTER HAVING A MEETING, WHICH 

348
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,043
THE PRESIDENT IN HIS OWN WORDS 

349
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:04,977
SAID WAS FANTASTIC, IT WENT 

350
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:09,715
GREAT, HERE WE ARE, WITNESSING 

351
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:10,716
A MOMENT IN HISTORY, WHERE THE 

352
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,084
PRESIDENT INDICATED TO 

353
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,084
REPORTERS THAT THEY WERE ON 

354
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:13,986
THEIR WAY TO SOME KIND OF 

355
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,154
SIGNING, AND NOW, CAMERAS HAVE 

356
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,991
BEEN SET UP, FLAGS OF BEEN 

357
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,759
PLACED, CHAIRMAN KIM'S PEN HAS 

358
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,094
BEEN CLEANED, A REALLY SURREAL 

359
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,195
MOMENT FOR THOSE OF US WATCHING 

360
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:26,198
THIS. 

361
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,766
IF YOU MISSED IT, ONE OF THE 

362
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,170
HANDLERS WENT TO THE SEAT THAT 

363
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,107
PRESUMABLY CHAIRMAN KIM WILL BE 

364
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,342
SITTING IN, PUT ON A PLAYER OF

00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,343
WHITE GLOVES, AND PICKED UP THE 

366
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:41,747
PEN, AND DID WHATEVER HE DID, 

367
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:42,647
HE CLEANED IT, AND WHO KNOWS 

368
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:43,983
WHAT, MADE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT 

369
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,351
FAULTY, AND PLACED IT BACK ON 

370
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:51,623
THAT MATT, AND NOW WE ARE JUST 

371
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:52,691
WAITING FOR THE TWO LEADERS TO 

372
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:53,993
EMERGE, WE GUESS, FROM THOSE 

373
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,527
DOUBLE DOORS.

374
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:59,565
>> WAITING FOR THE NEWS TO 

375
00:14:59,565 --> 00:14:59,798
HAPPEN. 

376
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:00,766
ONE KIND OF IMAGINES HOW LONG 

377
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:06,138
THIS WILL GO ON, WERE HOW LONG 

378
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,105
THIS COULD GO ON BEFORE PEOPLE 

379
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,007
STARTED LEAVING, ONE HOUR, TWO 

380
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:08,841
HOURS, THREE HOURS, WE JUST 

381
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:16,281
CONTINUE TO WAIT HERE, BUT WE 

382
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,449
WOULD, BECAUSE WHAT IS GOING TO 

383
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,250
HAPPEN IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. 

384
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:18,884
>> IF THIS WAS UNSCRIPTED, IT 

385
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:26,592
HAD NOT BEEN HAMMERED OUT IN 

386
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,659
DETAIL, THAT'S WHY THESE THINGS 

387
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:28,293
ARE TIGHTLY CHOREOGRAPHED, AND 

388
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:29,161
THAT'S WHY WE HAD AN EXACT 

389
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,028

394
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:39,638
GOING TO HAPPEN.

395
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,639
>> AT THE G7, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

396
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,339

00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,685
MOVEMENT AT THE DOOR, WHICH IS 

402
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:54,953
SEE WHAT IT IS BEFORE WE GO TO 

403
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:55,987
A COMMERCIAL BREAK. 

404
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:57,423
REMARKABLE.

405
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:01,026

OUT, WHO KNOWS HOW LONG THIS 

407
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,066
COULD GO ON FOR, SO WHY DON'T WE

408
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,067
-- HOPING IT DOESN'T HAPPEN 

409
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,334
WHILE WE ARE IN A COMMERCIAL 

410
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:12,371

KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN, THE

MEETING FOR THE MOST PART GOING 

424
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:14,813
BY THE LETTER, BY THE HOUR, AS 

425
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:15,880
RELEASED BY THE HOUSE -- THE 

426
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,748
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY, WE 

427
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:17,783
HAD A SCHEDULE OF EVENTS, AND 

428
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,984
THEN AT A MOMENT, THE PRESIDENT 

429
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:25,323
AND KIM JONG-UN EXITED THE úWOR 

430
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:26,692
WALKED OVER TO REPORTERS AND 

431
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,961
CAMERAS, AND SUGGESTED THAT 

432
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:31,396
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING GREAT, 

433
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,966
FANTASTIC MEANING, LOTS OF 

434
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:35,600
PROGRESS, TOP-OF-THE-LINE, AND 

435
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,705
THEN AT ONE POINT HE SAID WE 

436
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:40,404
ARE ON OUR WAY TO A SIGNING, 

437
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:45,310
AND EVERYONE LOOKED AROUND AND 

438
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:45,743
SAID WHAT IS THAT? 

439
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:46,778
AND WE HAVE CAMERAS TRAINED ON 

440
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,746
THE DOUBLE DOORS AT THE CAPELA 

441
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:56,788
HOTEL, THERE MIGHT BE SOME KIND 

442
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:57,823
OF SIGNING, WHAT IS BEING SIGN, 

443
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,056
WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA, WE 

444
00:20:59,056 --> 00:20:59,891
HAVE TALKED TO HER REPORTERS, 

445
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,393
AND ZEKE MILLER IS THERE, THEY 

446
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,529
HAVE INDICATED TO US THAT THEY 

447
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:09,501
ARE SCRATCHNG THEIR HEADS, 

448
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,535
MUCH THE SAME WAY WE ARE, 

449
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,770
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS 

450
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,271
GOING TO BE SIGN, AND WE EXPECT 

451
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:15,674
THAT THE PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN 

452
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,541
KIM WILL EMERGE FROM THOSE 

453
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,876
DOUBLE DOORS, WHAT IS GOING TO 

454
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:27,552
SIT -- TO BE SIGNED, WE DON'T 

455
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:28,420
KNOW, WHAT WAS NEXT ON THE 

456
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,454
AGENDA WAS THE PRESIDENT MAKING 

457
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,288
COMMENTS TO THE PRESS ABOUT 4 

458
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:33,892
PM LOCAL TIME, BUT RIGHT NOW, 

459
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:34,926
WE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT 

460
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:35,927
HAPPENS THE NEXT COUPLE OF 

461
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:36,728
MOMENTS HERE. 

462
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,731
WHEN THOSE DOORS OPEN UP IN 

463
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,334
THOSE TWO LEADERS WALK OUT. 

464
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,737
I'M HERE WITH GABE, AND ISAAC 

465
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,571
STONE FISH, WE HAVE BEEN 

466
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:47,906
TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR THE LAST 

467
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:48,974
COUPLE OF HOURS.  

468
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:49,441
A REMARKABLE MOMENT. 

469
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:55,547
>> IT IS AN UNEXPECTED MOMENT, 

470
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,581
AND IT WILL DICTATE HOW THIS 

471
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,518
RELATIONSHIP MOVES FORWARD. 

472
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,385
AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER, BOTH 

473
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,753
PARTIES ARE IN THIS WEIRD 

474
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,055
SITUATION, THEY ARE TRYING TO 

475
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:05,357
DECIDE HOW MUCH THEY WANT TO 

476
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,558
PUSH EACH OTHER, AND THIS IDEA, 

477
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:14,466
IF THEY PUSH TOO MUCH, IT COULD 

478
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,667
ALSO RUN THE RISK OF NOT BEING 

479
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,735
ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT, 

480
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,902
BUT ALSO A CRUCIAL MOMENT, WHAT 

481
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:18,570
IF THEY DON'T PUSH ENOUGH? 

482
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,271
BEHIND THOSE DOUBLE DOORS, 

483
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,539
WHERE ALL THE ACTION IS 

484
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,576
HAPPENING, SOME SORT OF 

485
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,409
NEGOTIATION, WHAT EXACTLY IS 

486
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:27,278
GOING TO BE SIGNED, WILL BE ON 

487
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:29,848
THAT, WHATEVER THAT DECLARATION 

488
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,782
IS.

489
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:34,586
>> THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL. 

490
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,286
MANY TIMES AFTER MEETINGS 

491
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:37,222
BETWEEN TWO WORLD LEADERS, THE 

492
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:40,024
SIGN CURRENT -- SOME KIND OF A 

493
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:51,770
DOCUMENT, AND THEN DIPLOMACY 

494
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,270
COMES AFTERWARDS, AND 

495
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,104
UNDERLINGS ENGAGE IN THE HARD 

496
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:54,438
BUSINESS OF DIPLOMACY, BUT IT 

497
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:57,909
DOES SEEM THAT THERE WAS SOME 

498
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,045
KIND OF MOMENT HERE WHERE IT 

499
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,882
FELT UNSCRIPTED, IT FELT VERY 

500
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:09,086
ORGANIC, BECAUSE IT IS NOT -- 

501
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:10,522
WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A HALF 

502
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,356
HOUR OR SO, THE FACT THAT IT 

503
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:15,560
HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE YET, WHERE 

504
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,194
EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN BY THE 

505
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:16,727
MINUTE, IT IS UNUSUAL. 

506
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:17,428
>> ALL OF THESE EXPECTATIONS 

507
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:18,864
OVER HOW LEADERS ARE SUPPOSED 

508
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,932
TO BEHAVE, AND TRUMP CERTAINLY 

509
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,235
DOESN'T FOLLOW A LOT OF THOSE, 

510
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,068
AND KIM JONG-UN DOESN'T FOLLOW 

511
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:27,839
A LOT OF THOSE, WE DON'T KNOW 

512
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,906
WHAT HIS EXPECTATIONS ARE FOR 

513
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:30,975
THIS, BUT THE WAY THAT DIPLOMACY

514
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:32,544
, THE WAY THAT SUMMITS ARE 

515
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,879
USUALLY PRACTICE, CERTAINLY 

516
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:36,114
DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE WAY 

517
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,816
THIS IS UNFOLDING.

518
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,384
>> LET'S GO TO CBS NEWS 

519
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:43,154
CORRESPONDENT STEPHEN PORTNOY, 

520
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:44,189
HE HAS BEEN WITNESSING WHAT WE 

521
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:48,994
HAVE BEEN WITNESSING ON CAMERA, 

522
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:49,861
JUST TALK US THROUGH THE 

523
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:50,996
REMARKABLE MOMENT WITH THE 

524
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:51,630
PRESIDENT CAME OUT TO THE PRESS 

525
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,031
POOL AND MADE COMMENTS ABOUT 

526
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,568
ASSIGNING?>> PRESIDENT TRUMP 

527
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,602
WALKED DOWN THE PATH WITH KIM 

528
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,603
JONG-UN BY HIS SIDE, AND THEY 

529
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,271
FACED REPORTERS, AND THE 

530
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,739
PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE MEETING 

531
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,775
IS GOING BETTER THAN ANYONE 

532
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:05,510
COULD HAVE EXPECTED, TOP-OF-THE-

533
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,580
LINE, A REALLY GOOD. 

534
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,781
AND THEN HE SAID THAT HE AND 

535
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,649
THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR WOULD 

536
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:11,349
BE SIGNING SOMETHING SHORTLY, 

537
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,318
BUT HE DID NOT SAY WHAT, HE HAS 

538
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,620
BEEN TAKEN -- THEY HAVE BEEN 

539
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,358
TAKEN TO A ROOM, 2 CHAIRS, AND 

540
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:29,301
PENS AT BOTH CHAIRS, WITH NORTH 

541
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,302
KOREAN AND AMERICAN FLAGS, IN A 

542
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:30,936
FEW MOMENTS, WE EXPECT THEY 

543
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:31,469
WILL EMERGE FROM THE 

544
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,103
BACKGROUND, TAKE THEIR SEATS, 

545
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:36,107
AND SIGN SOMETHING.>> I HAVE 

546
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:36,941
BEEN POINTING OUT TO VIEWERS, 

547
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:38,209
THIS HISTORIC MEETING BETWEEN 

548
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:42,981
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN 

549
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,848

550
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:44,816
MINUTE, THE WHITE HOUSE 

551
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,251
RELEASED A DAILY GUIDE IN PRESS 

552
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,688
SCHEDULE, AND FOR THE MOST PART,

553
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:56,561
EVERYTHING THEY SKI -- SIGNAL 

554
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,596
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN HAPPEN BY 

555
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,030
THE MINUTE, BUT THIS WAS NOT ON 

556
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,330
THE AGENDA. 

557
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,168
>> THIS WAS NOT AN EXPECTED 

558
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:03,868
EVENT, BUT THE WAY THIS HAS 

559
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:04,469
BEEN ORCHESTRATED, THERE WAS 

560
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,171
SOME DEGREE OF PLANNING TO 

561
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,074
STAGE IT, THERE ARE LIGHTS, AND 

562
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,810

COURSE, AND REPORTERS HAVE BEEN 

565
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,045
BROUGHT IN CERTAINLY SOMEBODY 

566
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:18,049
HAD AN IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING 

567
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,918
TO HAPPEN, BUT WE WERE INCLUDED 

568
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,386
ON IT. 

569
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,354
WE HAVE SEEN AT LEAST THREE 

570
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,855
SEPARATE, OR MAYBE FOUR, IF YOU 

571
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,325
INCLUDE THE LUNCH, WHERE THEY 

572
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,193
HAVE BEEN SEEN TOGETHER ON 

573
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,228
CAMERA, THERE WAS THE INITIAL 

574
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,363
MEETING WHERE THEY BOTH WALKED 

575
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,532
OUT AND SHOOK -- SHOULD EACH OF 

576
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:41,206
HIS HANDS, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK 

577
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,974
KIM ASIDE, AND THE SCENE WAS SO 

578
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:43,574
SURREAL, THEY THOUGHT IT WAS 

579
00:25:43,574 --> 00:25:44,476
OUT OF A SCI-FI MOVIE, IS WHAT 

580
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,910
KIM SAID, AND THEN THEY WERE IN 

581
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,544
A PRIVATE MEETING WITH ONLY 

582
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,046
INTERPRETERS, AND THEY SAID TO 

583
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:55,520
ONE ANOTHER, THAT THEY WOULD 

584
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,421
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION, THE 

585
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:57,055
PRESIDENT TRUSTED THAT IT WOULD 

586
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:57,756
BE SUCCESSFUL, THEN THE AIDS 

587
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:58,823
WERE BROUGHT IN, AND THE 

588
00:25:58,823 --> 00:25:59,791
PRESIDENT SAID THAT A DEAL IS 

589
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,224
GOING TO GET DONE. 

590
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:03,061
HE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT SAY WHAT. 

591
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,863
THEN WE SAW THE BEEN HAVING A 

592
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:10,969
WORKING LUNCH, OF SHORT RIB, 

593
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,837
AND SWEETS ARE POOR, AND THEN, 

594
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,439
THEY WALKED TOWARDS THE PRESS, 

595
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:18,510
AND THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED 

596
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,278
THAT THIS DOCUMENT WOULD BE 

597
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,480
SIGNED, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS

598
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,049
, THAT THE TWO MEN ARE GOING TO 

599
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:24,382
AGREE TO. 

600
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,352
ONE HISTORICAL NOTE. 

601
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:32,257
IT WAS JUNE 11, 1993, THAT KIM 

602
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,359
JONG-UN'S GRANDFATHER SIGNED OR 

603
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,796
DIRECTED THE SIGNING, OF WHAT 

604
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,363
WAS THEN KNOWN AS THE AGREED 

605
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:41,933
FRAMEWORK, SOMETHING THAT TOOK 

606
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,935
PLACE EARLY IN THE CLINTON 

607
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,604
ADMINISTRATION, IN WHICH NORTH 

608
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,006
KOREA AGREED TO THE PRINCIPLE 

609
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:51,709
OF A NUCLEAR FREE PENINSULA, 

610
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:52,743
WHAT WE LATER LEARNED WAS THAT 

611
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:58,450
THEY SECRETLY DEVELOP A -- 

612
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,384
DEVELOPED A NUCLEAR WEAPONS 

613
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,151
PROGRAM, AND NOW WE KNOW BASED 

614
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,686
ON THE REPORTING OF DAVID MARTY 

615
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:09,094
-- DAVID MARTIN AT THE 

616
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,194
PENTAGON, NORTH KOREA HAS THE 

617
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:10,828
CAPABILITY TO FIRE A BALLISTIC 

618
00:27:10,828 --> 00:27:11,663
MISSILE THAT COULD REACH THE 

619
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:12,463
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES, AND 

620
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:13,497
THE CONCERN HAS BEEN THAT THEY 

621
00:27:13,497 --> 00:27:14,966
HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO PUT A 

622
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,103
NUCLEAR WARHEAD ON THAT MISSILE.

623
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,670
WE HAVE HEARD, THAT AT ANY 

624
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:26,744
MOMENT, WE WILL SEE PRESIDENT 

625
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:27,912
TRUMP WITH KIM JONG-UN, AND THE 

626
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:28,846
PRESIDENT IS SCHEDULED TO HAVE 

627
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:30,148
A NEWS CONFERENCE IN SINGAPORE 

628
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:45,029
IN ABOUT 2.5 HOURS, WE HAVE 

629
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:46,231
HEARD HIM SAY IT HAS BEEN A 

630
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,065
GOOD MEETING, BETTER THAN 

631
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:47,665
ANYONE COULD HAVE EXPECTED, 

632
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,633
AIDES ARE NOW PLACING SOME SORT 

633
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,634
OF DOCUMENT ON THE TABLE, FOR 

634
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,001
EACH OF THE LEADERS TO SIGN, WE 

635
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,704
STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT IS INSIDE 

636
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,939
THOSE BINDERS.>> IT IS A 

637
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:59,244
REMARKABLE TURN OF EVENTS, AND 

638
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,411
WE KNOW OVER THE WEEKEND, THE 

639
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:01,780
PRESIDENT SUGGESTED TO THE

00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,747
WORLD, AND TO THE PRESS CORPS, 

641
00:28:03,747 --> 00:28:04,949
THAT WITHIN A MINUTE, HE WOULD 

642
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,719
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT MR. KIM'S 

643
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,087
INTENTIONS WERE SOLID, WHETHER 

644
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:15,093
OR NOT YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO 

645
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,126
AGREE TO SOME OF THE THINGS 

646
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:17,062
THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS 

647
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,696
LOOKING FOR, AND GIVEN WHAT WE 

648
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,864
HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST FOUR OR 

649
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:24,369
FIVE HOURS, THE WAY THAT THEY 

650
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,069
HAVE ENGAGED WITH EACH OTHER, 

651
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:26,237
AND THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN 

652
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,438
SORT OF TALKING TO -- EVEN WHEN 

653
00:28:27,438 --> 00:28:32,944
THEY APPROACHED CAMERAS, BRIEF 

654
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:33,978
ASIDES TO THE PRESS, JUST BEING 

655
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:34,812
THERE AND WITNESSING THAT, WHAT 

656
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:36,114
DID YOU MAKE OF IT? 

657
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,282
>> THE BODY LANGUAGE WAS 

658
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,018
STRIKING, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

659
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:40,685
CHARACTERISTICALLY HAS BEEN 

660
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:41,852
ACTING AS THE MASTER OF 

661
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:45,089
CEREMONIES, TAPPING KIM JONG-UN 

662
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:45,723
ON THE SHOULDER, DIRECTING HIM 

663
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:48,793
INTO A ROOM, AT ONE POINT HE 

664
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:49,593
WAS JOKING WITH THE 

665
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:53,331
PHOTOGRAPHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT 

666
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,365
YOU MAKE HIM LOOK NICE AND 

667
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:59,904
PRETTY AND THIN, KIM JONG-UN 

668
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,105
HAS BEEN RATHER JOVIAL IN HIS 

669
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:01,673
APPEARANCE, HE HAS SMILED 

670
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,640
BROADLY, AND SEEMED TO CHUCKLE, 

671
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,041
BUT AT OTHER POINTS HE HAS 

672
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:06,477
SEEMED STOIC AND WORN A BLANK 

673
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:09,046
EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE. 

674
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:10,114
HE IS DRESSED IN A BLACK TUNIC, 

675
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:11,716
REMINISCENT OF THE KIND OF 

676
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,085
DRESS THAT CHAIRMAN MAO WOULD 

677
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,120
WEAR, PRESIDENT TRUMP IN A 

678
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,556
TRADITIONAL BUSINESS SUIT, VERY 

679
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:23,361
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE KIND OF 

680
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,395
ATTIRE HE WEARS, WITH A CLASSIC 

681
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,698
RED TIE THAT HE LIKES TO WEAR.>>

682
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,132
THE OTHER THING THAT IS 

683
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:33,638
FASCINATING, AS YOU HAVE 

684
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,340
COVERED THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE 

685
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,641
G-7 SUMMIT, THE TENSION THAT 

686
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,376
EXISTS NOW BETWEEN THE UNITED 

687
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,477
STATES AND SOME OF OUR 

688
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:41,212
STRONGEST AND OLDEST ALLIES, 

689
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:45,617
INCLUDING FRANCE AND CANADA, 

690
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,251
THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTING THAT 

691
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,185
RUSSIA SHOULD BE ALLOWED BACK 

692
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:54,893
INTO THE G-7, AND THEN MAKING 

693
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:55,527
SOME DEROGATORY COMMENTS ABOUT 

694
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,194
THE PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA, 

695
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,462
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, ECHOED BY ONE 

696
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,096
OF HIS ADVISORS ON TELEVISION, 

697
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,999
CONTRAST THAT WITH THE WAY THAT 

698
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:01,866
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEHAVED WITH 

699
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,501
CHAIRMAN KIM OF THE LAST COUPLE 

700
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:03,868
OF HOURS? 

701
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:10,141
>> THE TENSION WITH THE G-7 

702
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,442
ALLIES HAS TO SOME DEGREE BEEN 

703
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,911
OVERSHADOWING THE LEAD UP TO 

704
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:17,148
THE SUMMIT, ONE OF THE THINGS 

705
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,182
THAT WAS ASKED TO SECRETARY OF 

706
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:19,217
STATE MIKE POMPEO WAS HOW THE 

707
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:23,354
NORTH KOREANS COULD TRUST THE 

708
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,255
COMMITMENT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

709
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,223
MIGHT MAKE TO THEM IF HE WAS 

710
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,324
WILLING TO INITIALLY SIGN ON TO 

711
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,860
THE G-7 COMMUNIQUC BUT THEN 

712
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,894
ONCE HE HEARD ABOUT WHAT JUSTIN 

713
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,429
TRUDEAU SAID ABOUT HIM AT A 

714
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,263
PRESS CONFERENCE, UNIQUE TO THE 

715
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,265
U.S. OUT OF THAT COMMUNIQUC 

716
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:39,537
SECRETARY MIKE POMPEO DID NOT 

717
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,805
DIRECTLY ANSWER THAT, BUT IT 

718
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:41,338
CERTAINLY STILL LINGERS. 

719
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:46,844
>> THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE 

720
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:47,712
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH OUR 

721
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:48,745
PANEL AND A TRIO OF ANALYST, 

722
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:49,480
JOINING US THROUGHOUT THE 

723
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,915
COVERAGE, GIVEN THE FACT THAT 

724
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,516
THE PRESIDENT INSTRUCTED HIS 

725
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:59,257

00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:01,966
FROM THE BODY LANGUAGE, THIS 

909
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,434
COULD BE SOMETHING PRETTY 

910
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,503
IMPORTANT.>> THIS IS A 

911
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,973
MASSIVELY IMPORTANT MOMENT. 

912
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,007
TRUMP LEADING UP TO THIS HAD 

913
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,308
REALLY TRIED TO MANAGE 

914
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,876
EXPECTATIONS, WITH THE SIGNING, 

915
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:17,615
HE THREW THAT OUT THE WINDOW. 

916
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,449
HE IS REALLY EXPLAINING HOW 

917
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,316
IMPORTANT THIS IS, WE DON'T 

918
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,018
KNOW WHAT IT IS YET, WE HAD KIM 

919
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:25,322
JONG-UN SAYING THAT THEY ARE 

920
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:26,323
LEAVING THE PAST BEHIND, 

921
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,926
LEAVING HISTORY BEHIND US, 

922
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:29,993
EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS ENTAILING, 

923
00:40:29,993 --> 00:40:34,265
THEY SAID THEY WILL AND THOSE 

924
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,433
DOCUMENTS OUT, AND FASCINATED 

925
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,033
TO SEE WHAT THOSE ARE. 

926
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,635
>> WE ALL ARE, A SPECIAL MOMENT 

927
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:41,638
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, SOMETHING 

928
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:42,673
THAT HE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

929
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:49,179
FOR QUITE SOME TIME, HE DID 

930
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:50,481
BELIEVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF 

931
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,515
MAXIMUM PRESSURE THAT HE PUT ON 

932
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:52,082
THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME IS 

933
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,350
DIRECTLY WHAT LED TO THIS 

934
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,119
MOMENT, WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

935
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:56,953
CALLED A HISTORIC MOMENT, THIS 

936
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:57,988
IS SOMETHING WE HAVE NEVER SEEN 

937
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:58,822
BEFORE, IT NORTH KOREAN LEADER 

938
00:40:58,822 --> 00:40:59,723
SITTING DOWN WITH A SITTING 

939
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,158
U.S. PRESIDENT TO HAMMER OUT 

940
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:06,831
SOME DETAILS, AND GETTING TO 

941
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:07,631
THIS POINT, WHERE YOU SEE THE 

942
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,498
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES 

943
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:09,065
SIGNING A DOCUMENT, SIDE-BY-

944
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:10,267
SIDE, WITH THE DICTATOR OF 

945
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:13,637
NORTH KOREA, THIS IS BY ALL 

946
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,673
EXTENTS, THE PRESIDENT SAID IT 

947
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:17,808
WAS SOMETHING HE WANTED TO DO, 

948
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,810
AND HERE HE IS DOING IT. 

949
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,978
>> THERE WAS A MOMENT WHERE YOU 

950
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:26,784
COULD HEAR A REPORTER ASKED, 

951
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,317
HAVE YOU AGREED TO 100% 

952
00:41:27,317 --> 00:41:27,918
DENUCLEARIZATION, AND HE WAS 

953
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:30,487
PRESIDENT, TOTAL SILENCE. 

954
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:31,689
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT IS 

955
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:32,690
IN THE DOCUMENT, THAT WILL BE 

956
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:32,957
CRUCIAL. 

957
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,925
BUT VERY STRIKING, LOOKING AT 

958
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:39,597
THIS ROOM, THE POSITIONS, IS 

959
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,532
NORTH KOREA READY TO GIVE UP ITS

960
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,734
NUCLEAR WEAPONS, UNDER WHAT 

961
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:43,967
TERMS? 

962
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:46,604
A AMAZING MOMENT. 

963
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,104
>> CHAIRMAN KIM SAID THEY ARE 

964
00:41:48,104 --> 00:41:49,306
GOING TO BE LEAVING THE PAST 

965
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:52,276
BEHIND, YOU CAN INTERPRET THAT 

966
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:53,944
IN MANY WAYS, DOES IT MEAN A 

967
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:58,682
CESSATION OF THE KOREAN WAR, 

968
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,516
WHICH HAS NEVER ENDED, THAT 

969
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:05,055
COULD BE ONE THING, IT COULD 

970
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:05,889
MEAN GIVING UP THEIR NUCLEAR 

971
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:06,757
WEAPONS, THAT IS ANOTHER, SO 

972
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:07,457
MANY POSSIBILITIES, WE SIMPLY 

973
00:42:07,457 --> 00:42:08,759
DON'T KNOW, I KEEP LOOKING AT 

974
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:14,498
MY EMAIL, LOOKING DOWN, HE SAID 

975
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,699
HE WILL MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO 

976
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,734
THE PRESS, AND AS SOON AS WE 

977
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,035
KNOW, WE WILL SHARE WITH OUR 

978
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:18,668
VIEWERS, BUT I'M INTRIGUED 

979
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:19,869
ABOUT WHAT THIS COULD POSSIBLY 

980
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:21,438
BE. 

981
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:22,473
THIS PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNED ON 

982
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,708
BEING A CHANGE AGENT, DISRUPTOR,

983
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,742
AND HOWEVER YOU WANT TO CUT 

984
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:31,248
THIS, NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF -- 

985
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:31,815
WHAT SIDE OF THE POLITICAL 

986
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,017
AISLE YOU'RE ON, THIS IS WHAT 

987
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:38,122
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.>> IF IT 

988
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:38,956
IS SOMETHING SYMBOLIC LIKE THE 

989
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,024
END TO THE KOREAN WAR, OR 

990
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,059
TALKING ABOUT A NEW FRIENDSHIP 

991
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,363
BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS, THAT 

992
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:47,230
WILL BE A LOT MORE -- 

993
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,064
┗> THESE A 

994
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:50,634
WE'RE LOOKING AT, AGAIN, THE 

995
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:51,501
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

996
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:53,437
AND CHAIRMAN KIM.

997
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:56,807
>> A GREAT PERSONALITY, VERY 

998
00:42:56,807 --> 00:43:02,479
SMART, A WORTHY NEGOTIATOR. 

999
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,783
ON BEHALF OF HIS PEOPLE, HE IS 

1000
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,151
A VERY WORTHY AND SMART 

1001
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:07,451
NEGOTIATOR. 

1002
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:11,288
WE HAD A TERRIFIC DAY. 

1003
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,456
WE LEARN MORE ABOUT EACH OTHER 

1004
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,757
AND ABOUT OUR COUNTRIES.

1005
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:21,565
>> WHAT DID YOU LEARN ABOUT HIM?

1006
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,534
>> I LEARNED THAT HE IS A VERY 

1007
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:24,534
TALENTED MAN. 

1008
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:26,069
THAT HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY VERY 

1009
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:28,172
MUCH.

1010
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,439
>> WHEN WILL YOU SEE EACH OTHER 

1011
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:35,012
AGAIN? 

1012
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:54,631
>> WILL YOU BE MEETING AGAIN? 

1013
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:56,633
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH 

1014
00:43:56,633 --> 00:44:03,307
EVERYBODY.

1015
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:08,912
>>> THERE YOU HAVE IT, YOU ARE 

1016
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:09,713
LOOKING AT HISTORY IN THE 

1017
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,782
MAKING, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

1018
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:12,716
NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-

1019
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:13,483
UN, AFTER SIGNING WHAT HAS BEEN 

1020
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:16,253
CALLED A HISTORIC DOCUMENT, THE 

1021
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,621
TWO LEADERS SHAKING HANDS ONCE 

1022
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:21,558
AGAIN, AND YOU CAN SEE AS THE 

1023
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:22,426
CAMERAS WERE ROLLING, THEY WERE 

1024
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,061
HAVING WORDS WITHOUT EACH OTHER 

1025
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,797
-- WORDS WITH EACH OTHER, 

1026
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:27,730
WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF 

1027
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:29,133
TRANSLATORS, IT HAS BEEN SAID 

1028
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:37,007
THAT KIM JONG-UN DOES SPEAK 

1029
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,308
ENGLISH OR AT LEAST UNDERSTANDS 

1030
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,143
ENGLISH, AND HE SPEAKS GERMAN, 

1031
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:39,743
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE EXPECTS 

1032
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:40,844
THEY WILL MEET AGAIN MANY TIMES 

1033
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,179
IN THE FUTURE, HE IS A TALENTED 

1034
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,080
MAN, HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY VERY 

1035
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,681
MUCH, AND HE CALLED HIM A 

1036
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:45,649
WORTHY NEGOTIATOR. 

1037
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:51,655
THERE IS A LOT TO ABSORB HERE. 

1038
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:52,322
MOMENTS EARLIER, SITTING DOWN 

1039
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,257
WITH CHAIRMAN KIM, DOCUMENTS 

1040
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:56,794
PLACED IN FRONT OF THEM, BOTH 

1041
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,095
OF THOSE LEADERS SIGNING THOSE 

1042
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,029
DOCUMENTS, WE ARE GET TO KNOW 

1043
00:44:59,029 --> 00:44:59,396
WHAT THEY ARE. 

1044
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:00,230
WHAT THEY POSSIBLY COULD BE, 

1045
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,333
I'M CHECKING THOSE EMAILS, WE 

1046
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,069
STILL DON'T HAVE THEM YET, THIS 

1047
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:09,039
IS JUST A REMARKABLE MOMENT, AND

1048
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:09,840
CALLING ATTENTION TO THE 

1049
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,778
PRESENCE TWEET, FROM A FEW HOURS

1050
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,646
AGO TODAY, THE FACT THAT I AM 

1051
00:45:16,646 --> 00:45:20,184
HAVING A MEETING IS A BIG LOSS 

1052
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,785
FOR THE U.S., SAY THE HATERS 

1053
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:26,523
AND LOSERS, WE HAVE HOSTAGES, 

1054
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,424
TESTING AND MISSILE LAUNCHES 

1055
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:28,058
HAVE STOPPED, AND THESE PUNDITS 

1056
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,126
HAVE NOTHING ELSE THEY CAN SAY, 

1057
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,494
WE WILL BE FINE. 

1058
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:31,528
JUST GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN 

1059
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,130
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS, 

1060
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,131
THE PRESIDENT IS PROVING

1061
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:36,733
HIMSELF TO BE AT LEAST RIGHT 

1062
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,901
THIS MOMENT. 

1063
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,269
>> THAT IS PROBABLY TAKING IT A 

1064
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:43,707
BRIDGE TOO FAR, WE HAVE 

1065
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:44,341
ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF THAT NORTH 

1066
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:45,843
KOREA HAS STOPPED ANY SORT OF 

1067
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:53,016
NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES, THE FACT 

1068
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,051
THAT THEY HAVE NOT LAUNCHED A 

1069
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:54,717
MISSILE WERE DONE ANOTHER 

1070
00:45:54,717 --> 00:45:55,752
NUCLEAR TEST DOES NOT MEAN THAT 

1071
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,221
THEY WILL DO THAT IN THE NEXT 

1072
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:58,388
SEVERAL MONTHS, AND REALLY THE 

1073
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:05,729
IMPORTANCE HERE, IS IF THEY CAN 

1074
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:06,796
SIGN AN AGREEMENT THAT HELPS TO 

1075
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:07,464
BUILD BETTER RELATIONS, THAT'S 

1076
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,365
GREAT, BUT AS WE DISCUSSED 

1077
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:09,366
BEFORE, IT IS EASY FOR NORTH 

1078
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,367
KOREA TO BACK OUT OF THIS 

1079
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,468
RELATIONSHIP.>> AND THEY'VE 

1080
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:16,539
DONE THAT MANY TIMES THE PAST, 

1081
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:17,574
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF THEY 

1082
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:18,675
DIDN'T, AND IF THE AGREEMENT IS 

1083
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:19,977
ABLE TO BIND THEM IN A WAY THAT 

1084
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,011
IS BETTER FOR THE INTERESTS OF 

1085
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,446
BOTH COUNTRIES, BUT I THINK 

1086
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,213
THAT TRUMPS TWEET WAS CERTAINLY 

1087
00:46:24,213 --> 00:46:24,514
PREMATURE. 

1088
00:46:24,514 --> 00:46:28,017
>> IN THE LAST STATEMENT THAT 

1089
00:46:28,017 --> 00:46:34,323
WE JUST SAW, THE PRESIDENT 

1090
00:46:34,323 --> 00:46:34,957
CALLED MR. KIM A WORTHY 

1091
00:46:34,957 --> 00:46:36,025
NEGOTIATOR, SMART, A TALENTED 

1092
00:46:36,025 --> 00:46:38,228
MAN WHO LOVES HIS COUNTRY, THE 

1093
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,096
PRESIDENT IS STAKING HIS CLAIM 

1094
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,831
TO WANT TO BUILD THIS 

1095
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:41,498
RELATIONSHIP, HE SAID THEY WILL 

1096
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:45,235
MEET MANY TIMES, JUST THE FIRST 

1097
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,203
OF MANY DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE 

1098
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,171
TWO LEADERS, AND WE WILL HAVE 

1099
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:49,706
TO SEE WHAT THESE DEFINITIONS 

1100
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:52,609
MEAN. 

1101
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:53,176
AND KIM HIMSELF MENTIONED A 

1102
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:54,444
CHANGE IN THE HISTORIC 

1103
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:58,382
RELATIONSHIP, WHAT DOES THAT 

1104
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:58,582
MEAN? 

1105
00:46:58,582 --> 00:46:59,549
DOES THAT MEAN A CHANGE FROM 

1106
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:01,385
THE U.S. SIDE OF THE KOREAN 

1107
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:07,124
SIDE? 

1108
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,425
A NEW AND MORE PROSPEROUS, OPEN 

1109
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:08,892
NORTH KOREA? 

1110
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:09,559
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING 

1111
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:10,727
TO TAKE TIME TO UNWIND, BUT THE 

1112
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,362
FACT THAT THEY MET, THEY SIGNED 

1113
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:13,296
AN AGREEMENT, AS THE VIEWERS 

1114
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:14,897
ARE SEEING, IT IS A HISTORIC 

1115
00:47:14,897 --> 00:47:15,131
THING. 

1116
00:47:15,131 --> 00:47:19,569
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE IS 

1117
00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:20,504
GOING TO BE HOLDING A PRESS 

1118
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,338
CONFERENCE AND JUST ABOUT 40 

1119
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:25,309
MINUTES OR SO, WHICH IS MOVED 

1120
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,309
P EARLIER FROM WHAT WE THOUGHT 

1121
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:27,543
IT WAS GOING TO BE, WE THOUGHT 

1122
00:47:27,543 --> 00:47:28,912
IT WAS GOING TO BE 4 PM LOCAL 

1123
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:29,980
TIME, 4 AM EASTERN TIME, THE 

1124
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,415
PRESIDENT SAID IT WILL HAPPEN 

1125
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:32,215
ABOUT 2:30 PM. 

1126
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:35,485
TO YOUR POINT, THIS LOOKS 

1127
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,088
GREAT, AND FOR ALL WE KNOW, 

1128
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,456
WHATEVER WAS SIGNED, IS IN FACT 

1129
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,525
A HISTORIC DOCUMENT, THE 

1130
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,428
QUESTION WILL BE, WHAT THE 

1131
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:48,398
NORTH KOREANS HAVE AGREED TO, 

1132
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:49,299
WHAT KIND OF VERIFICATION 

1133
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,802
PROCESS WILL THEY AGREE TO, 

1134
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,036
THAT IS TO BE FIGURED OUT, WE 

1135
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:57,841
SIMPLY DON'T KNOW. 

1136
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:58,908
AND SO THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT 

1137
00:47:58,908 --> 00:48:00,310
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE 

1138
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:00,944
TO ANSWER, AND STILL A CHANCE, 

1139
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,346
THOSE QUESTIONS WILL COME FAST 

1140
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,881
AND FURIOUS, PEOPLE WANT TO 

1141
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:05,916
KNOW WHAT KIND OF 

1142
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:06,950
DENUCLEARIZATION ARE WE TALKING 

1143
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,185
ABOUT, THE HUMAN RIGHTS 

1144
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:10,354
CONDITIONS, THE PRESIDENT SAID 

1145
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:14,691
EARLIER THAT HE WOULD DO THAT. 

1146
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:15,725
WE ARE ON PINS AND NEEDLES 

1147
00:48:15,725 --> 00:48:16,760
HERE, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT 

1148
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,094
THIS DOCUMENT IS, CERTAINLY THE 

1149
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:20,563
DOCUMENT IS THERE, I THE 

1150
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:21,264
PRESIDENT WILL TAKE QUESTIONS. 

1151
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:22,699
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR QUESTION? 

1152
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:26,502
>> MY QUESTION WOULD BE, WHAT 

1153
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:27,471

SUBSTANTIVELY HAVE YOU AGREED 

1155
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:31,341
TO DO WITH MR. KIM? 

1156
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,609
THE FACT THAT THERE IS A 

1157
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,276
DOCUMENT ISN'T NECESSARILY GOOD 

1158
00:48:33,276 --> 00:48:34,877
NEWS, IT COULD BE QUITE BAD 

1159
00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:37,914
NEWS, THERE ARE A FEW TRAPS 

1160
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:39,916
THAT TRUMP COULD STEP INTO, 

1161
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,219
AGREEING PREMATURELY TO REMOVE 

1162

U.S. TROOPS FROM THE SOUTH 

1163
00:48:44,654 --> 00:48:45,822
KOREAN PENINSULA, OR WHETHER IT 

1164
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:51,828
IS ECONOMIC RELIEF BEFORE NORTH 

1165
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:52,696
KOREA HAS DONE ANYTHING, THERE 

1166
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,830
ARE PLENTY OF TRIPWIRES FOR 

1167
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:54,998

A REALITY TV STAR IN A FORMER 

1266
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,645
LIFE, HE KNOWS HOW TO DELIVER A 

1267
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,313
CLIFFHANGER, IT IS HARD TO 

1268
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:18,214
REMEMBER A TIME WHEN A 

1269
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,615
PRESIDENT WOULD SIT NEXT TO A 

1270
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:24,521
ANOTHER -- NEXT TO ANOTHER 

1271
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,555
FOREIGN HEAD OF STATE, AND NO 

1272
00:55:26,555 --> 00:55:33,129
ONE KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE SIGNING.

1273
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:34,463
HE SAID THERE HANDING IT OUT AT 

1274
00:55:34,463 --> 00:55:35,198
THE NEWS CONFERENCE, IT WAS 

1275
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:39,102
SCHEDULED FOR 4 PM, BUT HE SAID 

1276
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,003
IT WAS 2:30 PM, BUT NO, THIS IS 

1277
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,206
QUITE THE DRAMATIC ENDING TO 

1278
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:44,607
THE SUMMIT THAT THEY HAVE 

1279
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:45,274
AGREED TO SOMETHING, BUT NO ONE 

1280
00:55:45,274 --> 00:55:46,175
IS QUITE SURE WHAT IT IS. 

1281
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:50,079
>> AND JUST TAKE US BACK 

1282
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:50,980
THROUGH THE ENTIRETY OF THE 

1283
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,315
DAY, AS WE PLAY LIVE PICTURES 

1284
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,584
RIGHT NOW OF KIM JONG-UN'S 

1285
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:55,418
MOTORCADE DEPARTING THIS 

1286
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:55,985
HISTORIC MEETING, PRESIDENT

TRUMP SAYING ALL ALONG, OVER 

1288
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,958
THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, THAT 

1289
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,426
HIS RHETORIC HAS CHANGED FROM 

1290
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:05,428
SAYING THAT NORTH KOREA WOULD 

1291
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:09,365
BE MET WITH FIRE AND FURY, AND 

1292
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:10,400
LITTLE ROCKET MAN DOESN'T HAVE 

1293
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,668
A NUCLEAR BUTTON AS BIG AS HIS, 

1294
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:17,840
WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING 

1295
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,775
KIM JONG-UN IS A TALENTED MAN, 

1296
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:19,509
GOOD NEGOTIATOR, LOVES HIS

00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,044
COUNTRY VERY MUCH, WE WILL MEET 

1298
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,879
AGAIN. 

1299
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:23,680
TAKE US THROUGH WHAT WE SAW 

1300
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,347
UNFOLDING IN SINGAPORE OF THE 

1301
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,782
LAST COUPLE OF HOURS?>> 

1302
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:30,687
Reporter: THERE ARE A LOT OF 

1303
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:31,720
BYGONES TO LET BE, IT APPEARS 

1304
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,558
THAT BOTH MEN HAVE DONE THAT, 

1305
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,525
THEY CAME TO THIS MEETING, THEY 

1306
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:37,727
SEEMED TO HIT IT OFF AS MUCH AS 

1307
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,796
YOU CAN TELL BY BODY LANGUAGE, 

1308
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:40,463
THEN YOU SAW THESE 

1309
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:41,030
EXTRAORDINARY MOMENTS WHERE 

1310
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,465
THEY WERE WALKING TOGETHER IN 

1311
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:45,134
THE COLONNADE, THERE WAS ONE 

1312
00:56:45,134 --> 00:56:45,802
VERY STRANGE MOMENT WHERE 

1313
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,170
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACTUALLY WALKED 

1314
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,972
KIM JONG-UN OVER TO THE 

1315
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:53,576
PRESIDENTIAL LIMO, AND SHOWED 

1316
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,711
IT OFF, OPEN THE DOOR, AND SAID 

1317
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:55,745
SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF LOOK 

1318
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,946
AT MY CAR, AND THEY WERE BOTH 

1319
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,581
TALKING TO EACH OTHER, IN THE 

1320
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,616
HALLWAY THERE, THE PRESIDENT 

1321
00:57:00,616 --> 00:57:02,418
SAID THEY WERE GOING TO SIGN 

1322
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:05,221
SOMETHING, AND WE HAVE NOW HAD 

1323
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:06,790
THIS SIGNING CEREMONY, A VERY 

1324
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:11,060
UNIQUE DAY AS THESE THINGS GO, 

1325
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:11,961
AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 

1326
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:12,795
SEE WHAT THIS DOCUMENT ACTUALLY 

1327
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:12,995
SAYS. 

1328
00:57:12,995 --> 00:57:13,997
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME TEASES OUT 

1329
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,566
THERE SAYING, THIS IS A PRETTY 

1330
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:20,603
COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT, THAT 

1331
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,136
DENUCLEARIZATION WILL BE 

1332
00:57:21,136 --> 00:57:23,405
STARTING VERY QUICKLY, BUT 

1333
00:57:23,405 --> 00:57:24,907
THERE IS A LOT OF VAGUENESS IN 

1334
00:57:24,907 --> 00:57:26,509
THERE. 

1335
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:27,377
IS THAT THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF 

1336
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,745
NORTH KOREA, MEANING THEY GIVE 

1337
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:34,417
UP NORTH KOREA'S WEAPONS, OR 

1338
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:35,385
THE KOREAN PENINSULA, WHICH 

1339
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,019
WOULD ENTAIL THE UNITED STATES 

1340
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,221
AGREED TO REMOVE TROOPS, OR NOT 

1341
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,188
FLY NUCLEAR CAPABLE BOMBERS OF 

1342
00:57:39,188 --> 00:57:44,928
THE PENINSULA ANYMORE. 

1343
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:45,962
SO THOSE TERMS CAN MEAN VERY 

1344
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:46,829
DIFFERENT THINGS, WE WILL HAVE 

1345
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:48,030
TO SEE WHAT KIND OF DETAIL IS 

1346
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:49,065
IN THIS DOCUMENT, BUT IT DOES 

1347
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:49,999
APPEAR THAT THEY ARE LEAVING 

1348
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:53,002
THIS ON VERY GOOD TERMS, THE 

1349
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,304
PRESIDENT WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD 

1350
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,538
INVITE KIM JONG-UN TO THE WHITE 

1351
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:56,439
HOUSE, AND HE SAID OF COURSE HE 

1352
00:57:56,439 --> 00:58:00,877
WOULD, AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE 

1353
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:01,578
RELATIONSHIP HAS CHANGED, AND 

1354
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:09,351
KIM JONG-UN SAID THE WORLD WILL 

1355
00:58:09,351 --> 00:58:09,785
SEE SOMETHING NEW. 

1356
00:58:09,785 --> 00:58:10,719
>> NORTH KOREA AND THE UNITED 

1357
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:11,754
STATES ARE GOING TO BE LEAVING 

1358
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:13,623
THE PAST BEHIND THEY SAID, AND 

1359
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,258
JUST FOR OUR VIEWERS WHO MAY 

1360
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:16,125
NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH NORTH 

1361
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:20,496
KOREA, OTHER THAN WHAT HAS BEEN 

1362
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:21,364
REPORTED, IN OTHER WORDS THIS 

1363
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:22,397
IS A COUNTRY YOU HAVE TRAVELED 

1364
00:58:22,397 --> 00:58:27,437
TO, AND THAT YOU KNOW, THIS IS 

1365
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:27,870
A COUNTRY THAT HAS 

1366
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:28,538
CONCENTRATION CAMPS WHERE THEY 

1367
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:30,940
PUT THEIR OWN CITIZENS AND, 

1368
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,808
CHAIRMAN KIM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 

1369
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:32,675
THE ASSASSINATION OF FAMILY 

1370
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,411
MEMBERS, AND OTHERS WHO ARE IN 

1371
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:40,683
THE GOVERNMENT, THAT HE HAS 

1372
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,250
EITHER PURGED OR DISAGREED 

1373
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:41,984
WITH, SO HE IS A BRUTAL 

1374
00:58:41,984 --> 00:58:42,251
DICTATOR. 

1375
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:43,920
AND SOMETIMES OF COURSE THE 

1376
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,254
UNITED STATES HAS TO GET CLOSE 

1377
00:58:45,254 --> 00:58:48,191
TO THE DICTATOR TO SEE WHAT THE 

1378
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:52,829
PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN KIM 

1379
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:53,696
CALLED MAJOR CHANGE, BUT FROM 

1380
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,797
YOUR EXPERIENCE IN REPORTING 

1381
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,367
NORTH KOREA, THIS IS A VERY 

1382
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:57,734
BRUTAL REGIME. 

1383
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:03,640
>> -->> Reporter: YES, MOST 

1384
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,474
AMERICANS WOULD AGREE THAT IF 

1385
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:09,178
YOU CAN SIT DOWN AND WORK OUT A 

1386
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:09,979
DEAL THAT AVERTS A NUCLEAR WAR 

1387
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:11,047
IT'S WORTH IT, BUT YOU ARE 

1388
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,048
EXACTLY RIGHT, YOU CAN'T FORGET 

1389
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:16,919
WHO WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE, 

1390
00:59:16,919 --> 00:59:18,121
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT KIM 

1391
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,254
JONG-UN BEING A NEW KIND OF 

1392
00:59:19,254 --> 00:59:20,657
LEADER, THE KINDS OF THINGS HE 

1393
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:21,523
WAS TO DO, THAT'S ALL WELL AND 

1394
00:59:21,523 --> 00:59:22,225
GOOD, BUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU 

1395
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,526
SAID, IT IS A BRUTAL 

1396
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:24,193
DICTATORSHIP, WHERE PEOPLE HAVE 

1397
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:25,328
BEEN KILLED, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 

1398
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:29,365
STARVED, THIS WOULD NOT BE MUCH 

1399
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:30,600
DIFFERENT IF YOU HAD SEEN THE 

1400
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,200
FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH SITTING 

1401
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,568
DOWN FOR LUNCH AT A SUMMIT WITH 

1402
00:59:32,568 --> 00:59:32,968
SADDAM HUSSEIN. 

1403
00:59:32,968 --> 00:59:42,712
IT IS ON THAT LEVEL. 

1404
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:43,312
SO THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY 

1405
00:59:43,312 --> 00:59:44,046
THING TO WITNESS, THAT THIS 

1406
00:59:44,046 --> 00:59:44,847
HAPPENED TODAY, ESPECIALLY 

1407
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,249
THESE TWO LEADERS, WHO HAD THIS 

1408
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,351
PERSONAL ANIMOSITY, THIS WENT 

1409
00:59:49,351 --> 00:59:49,819
BEYOND TWO COUNTRIES 

1410
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:50,352
DIFFERENCES OVER NUCLEAR 

1411
00:59:50,352 --> 00:59:51,521
WEAPONS, THIS BECAME HIGHLY 

1412
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:54,323
PERSONALIZED BETWEEN TWO 

1413
00:59:54,323 --> 00:59:55,124
LEADERS, AND PEOPLE WERE 

1414
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:55,491
WORRIED ABOUT A 

1415
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:56,091
MISINTERPRETATION THAT COULD 

1416
00:59:56,091 --> 00:59:58,494
START A FULL ON WAR. 

1417
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:00,196
WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY FROM 

1418
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:04,300
THAT, TWO GUYS EATING HCGEN-

1419
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,069
DAZS, THIS HAS COME A LONG WAY. 

1420
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:10,573
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 

1421
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,208
>> THAT RHETORIC YOU WERE 

1422
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:13,208
TALKING ABOUT, THE PRESIDENT 

1423
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:14,177
REPEATEDLY CALLED HIM LITTLE 

1424
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,678
ROCKET MAN, AND KIM JONG-UN 

1425
01:00:16,678 --> 01:00:18,013
SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT OF 

1426
01:00:18,013 --> 01:00:23,686
THE UNITED STATES WAS A DOTARD, 

1427
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:26,522
SENILE OR WEAK MINDED. 

1428
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:27,689
AND NOW THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED 

1429
01:00:27,689 --> 01:00:29,459
STATES IS SAYING CHAIRMAN KIM 

1430
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,594
IS A WORTHY NEGOTIATOR AND A 

1431
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:37,633
TALENTED MAN. 

1432
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:38,601
AND I WAS ALSO INTRIGUED BY 

1433
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:39,201
REPORTERS, WESTERN REPORTERS 

1434
01:00:39,201 --> 01:00:40,336
SHOUTING QUESTIONS AT CHAIRMAN 

1435
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:44,207
KIM, SOMETHING THAT HE HAS 

1436
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,408
NEVER HAD TO DO WITH, A FREE 

1437
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:46,275
AND DEMOCRATIC PRESS ABOUT WHAT 

1438
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,677
HE IS DOING, FROM THE CAMERAS, 

1439
01:00:48,677 --> 01:00:49,879
THERE WAS A LOOK OF SURPRISE ON 

1440
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:55,251
HIS FACE.>> Reporter: YES, IT 

1441
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:56,118
IS AMAZING, THAT IS NOT 

1442
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:56,786
SOMETHING HE WOULD EVER 

1443
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:58,821
ENCOUNTER NORTH KOREA, NOT 

1444
01:00:58,821 --> 01:00:59,756
QUESTIONED BY JOURNALIST, BUT 

1445
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:00,456
NOT QUETIONED BY ANYONE. 

1446
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:03,860
SO I CERTAINLY THINK HE FOUND 

1447
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:07,830
IT AMUSING TO SOME GREEK -- 

1448
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,864
SOME DEGREE, HE DOES NOT ANSWER 

1449
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:14,504
THE QUESTIONS, BUT STRIKING AS 

1450
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,538
TO HOW WELL KIM JONG-UN HAS 

1451
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:16,439
CARRIED ON IN THE SITUATIONS 

1452
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:17,439
THAT ONE WOULD THINK ARE PRETTY 

1453
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,641
BORING TO HIM, HE SEEMS TO TAKE 

1454
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:19,875
IT ALL IN STRIDE. 

1455
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:23,946
WHAT I WILL FIND INDUSTRY IS 

1456
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:25,782
HOW THIS IS REPORTED -- WHAT I 

1457
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:31,453
WILL FIND INTERESTING IS HOW 

1458
01:01:31,453 --> 01:01:32,454
THIS IS REPORTED NORTH KOREA, 

1459
01:01:32,454 --> 01:01:32,955
REORIENTING THEIR WHOLE 

1460
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:38,261
OPERATION, PROPAGATION -- 

1461
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:39,228
PROPAGANDA ABOUT THE UNITED 

1462
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:39,962
STATES WANTING TO INVADE NORTH 

1463
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:40,562
KOREA, KILLING ITS CITIZENS, 

1464
01:01:40,562 --> 01:01:41,497
THERE ARE PROPAGANDA POSTERS UP 

1465
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:42,698
ALMOST EVERY CITY IN THE 

1466
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:48,538
COUNTRY. 

1467
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,738
THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO 

1468
01:01:49,738 --> 01:01:50,272
DEPROGRAM THE PROPAGANDA 

1469
01:01:50,272 --> 01:01:51,273
APPARATUS, AND CHANGE THIS IF 

1470
01:01:51,273 --> 01:01:52,742
THIS IS REALLY GOING TO BE A 

1471
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:53,275
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE 

1472
01:01:53,275 --> 01:01:58,314
RELATIONSHIP WITH UNITED STATES.

1473
01:01:58,314 --> 01:01:59,348
SO FAR, WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY 

1474
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:00,116
REPORTING NORTH KOREA ABOUT THE 

1475
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:01,184
OUTCOME OF THE SUMMIT, AND 

1476
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:02,151
TYPICALLY THERE IS A BIT OF A 

1477
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:03,586
LAG BEFORE THEY TELL THEIR 

1478
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:04,720
PEOPLE SOMETHING, BUT THEY HAVE 

1479
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,088
TOLD PEOPLE THAT HE IS HERE FOR 

1480
01:02:06,088 --> 01:02:08,157
THE SUMMIT, THEY EXPECT -- WE 

1481
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:09,659
EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD REPORT 

1482
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:17,966
ON THE SUMMIT, AND THE RESULT, 

1483
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:19,334
AND WE HOPE THAT IT IS THE SAME 

1484
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:20,403
REPORTING THAT WE SEE HERE IN 

1485
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:20,837
SINGAPORE. 

1486
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:21,504
>> THOSE IMAGES, WITH THE 

1487
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:22,638
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 

1488
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:25,341
WITH THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER, 

1489
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:25,875
SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER 

1490
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,578
HAPPENED, HE HAS ACHIEVES -- 

1491
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,479
ACHIEVE SOMETHING THAT NEITHER 

1492
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:32,582
HIS FATHER OR GRANDFATHER WERE 

1493
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,852
ABLE TO ACHIEVE, IT IS AN 

1494
01:02:36,852 --> 01:02:44,427
ACCOMPLISHMENT, THAT THE 

1495
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,127
PRESIDENT SIGNALED WOULD BE 

1496
01:02:45,127 --> 01:02:45,795
SOMETHING HE WANTED TO 

1497
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:46,729
ACCOMPLISH, BUT FOR CHAIRMAN 

1498
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:47,530
KIM AS WELL, HE HAS DONE 

1499
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:52,501
SOMETHING THAT NORTH KOREA -- 

1500
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:53,536
EIGHT NORTH KOREAN LEADER HAS 

1501
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:53,869
NEVER DONE. 

1502
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:58,741
AS YOU KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN TALK

1503
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,076
THAT HE IS IN SOME WAYS VERY 

1504
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:01,310
SIMILAR TO HIS GRANDFATHER, 

1505
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:06,949
REPORTS OUT OF NORTH KOREA, 

1506
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:07,817
THAT'S WHAT HE GAINED THE 

1507
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,452
WEIGHT HE DID, HE CUTS HIS HAIR 

1508
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:09,952
THE SAME WAY THAT HIS 

1509
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:10,953
GRANDFATHER CUT HIS HAIR, AND 

1510
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:11,820
SO BY ACHIEVING THIS LEVEL OF 

1511
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,989
LEGITIMACY, WITH A U.S. 

1512
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:16,225
PRESIDENT, THAT IS ONE WAY WE 

1513
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:17,860
COULD SEE IT PLAYING OUT NORTH 

1514
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,830
KOREA?>> Reporter: IT IS A BIG 

1515
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:25,368
DEAL, THEY CAN USE THE 

1516
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:26,302
PROPAGANDA OF THAT MOMENT, 

1517
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,303
SHOWING HIM ON PAR WITH THE 

1518
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,003
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, TO 

1519
01:03:28,003 --> 01:03:29,572
KIND OF BURNISH HIS LEGACY AND 

1520
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,774
NORTH KOREA. 

1521
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:32,708
AND YOU ARE RIGHT, HE DOES TRY 

1522
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,577
TO EMULATE HIS GRANDFATHER, WHO 

1523
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:38,414
IS CONSIDERED GODLIKE AND NORTH 

1524
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:43,185
KOREA, MUCH MORE POPULAR THAN 

1525
01:03:43,185 --> 01:03:43,819
KIM JONG-UN'S FATHER, WHO HAD 

1526
01:03:43,819 --> 01:03:44,453
THE UNFORTUNATE TASK OF 

1527
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:49,225
PRESIDING OVER NORTH KOREA 

1528
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,726
DURING THE WORST FAMINE, ONE OF 

1529
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:51,794
THE WORST, IN HUMAN HISTORY, 

1530
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:56,332
LARGELY SELF-INFLICTED. 

1531
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,499
SO YES, KIM JONG-UN HAS TRIED 

1532
01:03:57,499 --> 01:03:58,200
TO APPEAR MORE LIKE HIS 

1533
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:58,968
GRANDFATHER, BECAUSE PEOPLE 

1534
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:07,643
THERE LIKE HIM. 

1535
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:08,711
BUT HE HAS DONE SOMETHING THAT 

1536
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:09,679
NO KIM HAS EVER DONE, BUT 

1537
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,913
REMEMBER THE REASON HE GETS 

1538
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:11,547
UNITED STATES, THE PRESIDENT, 

1539
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:12,515
TO SIT DOWN WITH HIM, WAS NOT 

1540
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,549
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO TALK TO 

1541
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:14,383
NORTH KOREA, IT WAS BECAUSE 

1542
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:15,418
NORTH KOREA WE BELIEVED HAD A 

1543
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:18,654
NUCLEAR WEAPON OF -- THAT WAS 

1544
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:19,388
CAPABLE OF HITTING UNITED 

1545
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:19,622
STATES. 

1546
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:20,256
IT WAS SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT 

1547
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:26,062
OF THE UNITED STATES FELT HE úH 

1548
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:26,929
THE UNITED STATES HAS WANTED TO 

1549
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:27,596
DO HISTORICALLY, BECAUSE OF 

1550
01:04:27,596 --> 01:04:28,664
SOME OF THE LEGITIMACY THAT IT 

1551
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:30,633
CONFERS AND THE LEADER OF NORTH 

1552
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:33,402
KOREA.>> -- CONFERS ON THE 

1553
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:41,844
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA.>>> YES, 

1554
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:42,678
THAT'S A GOOD POINT, CHAIRMAN 

1555
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,113
KIM, ACHIEVING THIS LEVEL OF 

1556
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:46,849
NUCLEAR PROFICIENCY, BY ITS 

1557
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,117
VERY NATURE, THE UNITED STATES 

1558
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:48,985
HAS TRIED TO PREVENT THAT FOR 

1559
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:51,320
THE LAST 30 OR 40 YEARS, KIM 

1560
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,188
JONG-UN ACHIEVES IT, AND THAT 

1561
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:57,159
WINS HIM A SEAT AT THE TABLE?

1562
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:58,027
>> Reporter: AND THERE IS 

1563
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,228
ALWAYS A CONCERN THAT WE LOOK 

1564
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,329
AT THIS TOO MUCH THROUGH THE 

1565
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:08,304
PRISM OF THE UNITED STATES, IN 

1566
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:09,204
TERMS OF ACTIONS THE PRESIDENT 

1567
01:05:09,204 --> 01:05:10,272
HAS TAKEN OR THE UNITED STATES 

1568
01:05:10,272 --> 01:05:10,773
IS TAKEN. 

1569
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:11,873
YOU ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER THE 

1570
01:05:11,873 --> 01:05:12,441
INTERNAL POLITICS OF NORTH 

1571
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:17,413
KOREA, IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT 

1572
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,481
KIM JONG-UN DID NOT WANT TO 

1573
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:19,348
HAVE THIS MEETING UNTIL HE 

1574
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:20,383
REALLY FELT HE WAS COMING INTO 

1575
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:24,653
IT IN A POSITION OF STRENGTH, 

1576
01:05:24,653 --> 01:05:25,554
AND LAUNCHING THAT FIRST 

1577
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:26,121
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 

1578
01:05:26,121 --> 01:05:27,189
MISSILE LAST YEAR, THAT BEGIN A 

1579
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:32,361
PROCESS WHERE HE FINALLY HAD A 

1580
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,028
HAND THAT WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO 

1581
01:05:33,028 --> 01:05:33,963
SIT DOWN AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE 

1582
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:34,796
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 

1583
01:05:34,796 --> 01:05:35,998
THIS SEEMS TO BE A PLAN, KIM 

1584
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:39,335
JONG-UN SAID ARE NUCLEAR FORCE 

1585
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:40,770
HAS BEEN BUILT, WE ARE PIVOTING 

1586
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,970
TO THE ECONOMY, THAT IS WHAT WE 

1587
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:50,246
ARE FOCUSING ON, HE REACHED OUT 

1588
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:51,313
TO SOUTH KOREA, WE WILL NOT 

1589
01:05:51,313 --> 01:05:52,181
SPOIL YOUR OLYMPICS, WE WILL 

1590
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:53,983
SEND OUR ATHLETES THERE, AND HE 

1591
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:56,285
GO MOON JAE-IN TO DO SOME WORK 

1592
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:56,919
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, TO ALLOW 

1593
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:57,586
THAT DIPLOMACY TO MOVE FORWARD, 

1594
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:59,455
TO CONVINCE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

1595
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,257
REALLY TO CONVINCE THEM IT 

1596
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:02,491
WOULD BE WORTH HIS WHILE TO SIT 

1597
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:14,303
DOWN WITH HIM. 

1598
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,037
THERE WAS THE EXTRAORDINARY 

1599
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:16,038
MOMENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THE 

1600
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:16,872
SOUTH KOREAN ENVOY SHOWED UP, 

1601
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:17,572
THEY BRIEFED PRESIDENT TRUMP, 

1602
01:06:17,572 --> 01:06:18,607
AND SAID THAT KIM JONG-UN WANTS 

1603
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:19,809
TO HAVE A SUMMIT, AND HE SAID 

1604
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:20,843
THEY CAN ANNOUNCE THAT ON THE 

1605
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:21,110
DRIVEWAY. 

1606
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:27,416
THAT CAME AS A SURPRISE TO 

1607
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:28,517
PEOPLE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THIS 

1608
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:29,418
HAS MOVED AT LIGHTNING SPEED, 

1609
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:30,252
AND IF THIS IS SOMETHING 

1610
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:30,853
<font color="#00FF00"><u>OMPREHENSIVE, SOMETHING THAT </u></font>

1611
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:31,787
NORTH KOREA IS MAKING SOME BIG 

1612
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:32,688
CONCESSIONS TO GIVE SOMETHING 

1613
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:33,589
UP, THAT WILL BE PRETTY 

1614
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:34,356
HISTORIC, ON THE OTHER HAND, IF 

1615
01:06:34,356 --> 01:06:43,299
THIS IS JUST VAGUE PROMISES, 

1616
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:44,333
JUST KEEP TALKING, I'M GLAD WE 

1617
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,234
ARE GETTING ALONG, KIND OF 

1618
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:46,035
AGREEMENT, I DON'T THINK THAT 

1619
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,502
WILL PLAY AS WELL IN THE UNITED 

1620
01:06:47,502 --> 01:06:48,237
STATES AS IT MIGHT PLAY IN 

1621
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:49,105
NORTH KOREA, AND NORTH KOREA 

1622
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:49,972
HAS THE UPPER HAND, BECAUSE 

1623
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:51,574
THEY CAN CONTROL THE MESSAGE IN 

1624
01:06:51,574 --> 01:07:02,918
THEIR COUNTRY.>> BEN TRACY,

THINK, WE ARE GOING TO 

1637
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:30,459
>>> WELCOME BACK TO CBS NEWS'S

COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, I WANT 

1645
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,237

LITTLE WHILE, THE LETTER THAT

WE ARE SIGNING IS VERY 

1650
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:52,348
COMPREHENSIVE, AND I THINK BOTH 

1651
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:53,314
SIDES ARE GOING TO BE IMPRESSED 

1652
01:10:53,314 --> 01:10:56,285
WITH THE RESULT, A LOT OF 

1653
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:57,086
GOODWILL WENT INTO THIS, A LOT 

1654
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,188
OF WORK IN PREPARATION. 

1655
01:10:59,188 --> 01:10:59,888
CHAIRMAN KIM SAID THAT TODAY 

1656
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:10,199
WAS A HISTORIC MEETING, AND 

1657
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:10,799
NORTH KOREA AND THE UNITED 

1658
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:11,934
STATES DECIDED TO LEAVE THE 

1659
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:12,701
PAST BEHIND, AND WE ARE ABOUT 

1660
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:13,569
TO SIGN A HISTORIC DOCUMENT, 

1661
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:14,603
THE WORLD WILL SEE A MAJOR 

1662
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:15,637
CHANGE, AND HE EXPRESSED HIS 

1663
01:11:15,637 --> 01:11:16,238
GRATITUDE PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 

1664
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:16,972
MAKING THIS HAPPEN. 

1665
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:18,407
ISAAC STONE FISH IS A SENIOR  

1666
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:22,177
INTRUDER, AND A FELLOW ON U.S. 

1667
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:23,579
AND CHINA RELATIONS, HE JOINS 

1668
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:23,912
ME NOW. 

1669
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:25,747
WE HAVE BEEN WITNESSING HISTORY 

1670
01:11:25,747 --> 01:11:29,718
IN THE MAKING, ISAAC, AND NOW 

1671
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:30,819
WE ARE ON PINS AND NEEDLES 

1672
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:33,322
TRYING TO SURMISE WHAT THIS 

1673
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:35,257
HISTORIC DOCUMENT, WHAT 

1674
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:36,625
CHAIRMAN KIM CALLED A HISTORIC 

1675
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:37,960
DOCUMENT IS, TO USE THAT 

1676
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,830
LANGUAGE, HISTORIC, FROM KIM, 

1677
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,465
COMPREHENSIVE FROM TRUMP, IF IT 

1678
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:48,303
TURNS OUT TO BE A GENERIC -- I 

1679
01:11:48,303 --> 01:11:49,304
CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT COULD BE, 

1680
01:11:49,304 --> 01:11:50,339
GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM 

1681
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,107
THE TWO LEADERS.

1682
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:53,642
>> I AM DYING TO SEE WHAT IS IN 

1683
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:57,746
THE DOCUMENT, AND TO KNOW. 

1684
01:11:57,746 --> 01:11:58,781
I THINK TRUMP HAS MOVED BACK 

1685
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:00,048
AND FORTH BETWEEN MANAGING 

1686
01:12:00,048 --> 01:12:02,584
EXPECTATIONS AND SAYING YES, 

1687
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:03,318
THIS IS TREMENDOUS, THIS IS 

1688
01:12:03,318 --> 01:12:04,286
AWESOME, THIS IS GREAT. 

1689
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:09,224
COULD BE SOMETHING -- MAY BE 

1690
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:13,429
FOR OUR OWN PSYCHE SAKE, WE 

1691
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:14,430
SHOULD GET OUR HOPES UP, IT 

1692
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,330
COULD BE SOMETHING MORE 

1693
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:16,030
MEASURED THAN WE ARE EXPECTING, 

1694
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:19,768
THAT THE U.S. SIDE WILL SPEND 

1695
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:20,936
AS A MASSIVE BREAKTHROUGH, AND 

1696
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:23,539
TO BE FAIR, THE FACT THAT THIS 

1697
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:24,573
IS HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE 

1698
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:32,514
IS ALREADY A HUGE BREAKTHROUGH, 

1699
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:33,348
VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHERE WE 

1700
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:33,982
ARE IN THE PAST. 

1701
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:34,917
>> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING OVER 

1702
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:35,950
THE LAST FIVE OR SIX HOURS, 

1703
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:36,985
ABOUT CHINA'S ROLE, I WANT TO 

1704
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:39,154
READ A TWEET THAT CAME FROM THE 

1705
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:41,290
PEOPLE'S DAILY, A CHINESE 

1706
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:41,890
APPARATUS NEWS ORGANIZATION, 

1707
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:45,127
BUT THE TWEET SAYS THAT CHINA 

1708
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:45,794
WELCOMES AND SUPPORTS THE 

1709
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:48,464
HISTORY MAKING TALKS BETWEEN 

1710
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:50,432
NORTH KOREA AND U.S. LEADERS, 

1711
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:53,502
WE WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AN 

1712
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:54,836
IMPORTANT ROLE TO SOLVE THE 

1713
01:12:54,836 --> 01:13:03,011
ISSUE. WE TALK ABOUT WHAT 

1714
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:03,678
BEIJING MIGHT BE WONDERING 

1715
01:13:03,678 --> 01:13:05,447
ABOUT WHAT THIS IS, WAS GOING 

1716
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:06,781
ON, THE RELATIONSHIP, PRESIDENT 

1717
01:13:06,781 --> 01:13:08,517
TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN HAVE, AND 

1718
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:15,324
WE ARE SEEING THAT THEY ARE 

1719
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:15,891
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS, IT GOES 

1720
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:16,892
BACK TO THE POINT THAT WE MADE 

1721
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,327
EARLIER, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE 

1722
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:19,461
CHAIRMAN KIM WOULD MAKE A MOVE 

1723
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:20,329
WITHOUT HAVING AGREED TO THE 

1724
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:22,898
MOVE BEFORE THE MEETING? 

1725
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:26,635
>> PUBLICLY, THEY ARE SHOWING A 

1726
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:27,703
SIGN OF SUPPORT, I WOULD LOVE 

1727
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:28,570
TO KNOW WHAT THEY ACTUALLY 

1728
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,470
THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. 

1729
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:30,973
[ LAUGHTER ] IT DOES FEEL 

1730
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:31,840
LIKELY THAT ONE OF THE REASONS 

1731
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,476
THAT KIM JONG-UN MET FOR A 

1732
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:36,445
SECOND TIME WITH CHINESE 

1733
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:41,483
CHAIRMAN XI JINGPING WAS TO 

1734
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:42,651
DISCUSS WHAT HE WAS ALLOWED TO 

1735
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,753
DO OR SAY IN THAT SUMMIT,  

1736
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:45,621
ANOTHER GOOD REMINDER OF HOW 

1737
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:48,690
IMPORTANT CHINA IS, A MASSIVE 

1738
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,625
COUNTRY, ONE .4 BILLION PEOPLE, 

1739
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:56,932
NORTH KOREA, REMOTE, POOR, 25 

1740
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:57,432
MILLIN PEOPLE, ANOTHER 

1741
01:13:57,432 --> 01:13:58,300
REMINDER THAT PROBABLY THE ROAD 

1742
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,501
TO PYONGYANG GOES THROUGH 

1743
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:03,472
BEIJING, AND IT WILL BE 

1744
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,305
INTERESTING TO SEE AS THE 

1745
01:14:04,305 --> 01:14:05,206
COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS UNFOLD, 

1746
01:14:05,206 --> 01:14:07,843
WHETHER OR NOT NORTH KOREA DOES 

1747
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:10,012
TRY TO MOVE AWAY FROM BEIJING, 

1748
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,813
AND TRY TO MOVE CLOSER TO THE 

1749
01:14:11,813 --> 01:14:16,718
UNITED STATES, OR WHETHER OR 

1750
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:17,586
NOT, WITH TENSIONS A BIDDING 

1751
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:18,253
BETWEEN UNITED STATES NORTH 

1752
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:21,523
KOREA, NORTH KOREA HAS A MORE 

1753
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,157
COMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH 

1754
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:23,425
CHINA, AND THE U.S. CAN TURN 

1755
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:29,731
ITS ATTENTION ELSEWHERE.>> WE 

1756
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:30,898
WERE TALKING TO BEN TRACY, WHO 

1757
01:14:30,898 --> 01:14:31,800
HAS TRAVELED TO NORTH KOREA, HE 

1758
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,001
DID MAKE THE POINT THAT IT DOES 

1759
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:34,736
SEEM THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE 

1760
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:35,269
TOTALITY OF WHAT WE HAVE 

1761
01:14:35,269 --> 01:14:37,873
WITNESSED OVER THE LAST 18 TO 

1762
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,508
36 MONTHS, THE NORTH KOREANS, 

1763
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:40,943
STEP-BY-STEP, APPLYING A 

1764
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:42,344
CERTAIN STRATEGY TO GET THEM TO 

1765
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:48,684
THIS POINT HERE, AND I KNOW THE 

1766
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,319
PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE HAS BEEN 

1767
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:50,952
PREPARING FOR THIS HIS ENTIRE 

1768
01:14:50,952 --> 01:14:56,425
LIFE, BUT OTHER REPORTS SAID 

1769
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:57,793
THAT HE HAD READ A LOT OF THE 

1770
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:58,760
BRIEFING REPORTS, AND HE WOULD 

1771
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,695
GO ON WHAT HAS MADE HIM 

1772
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:00,695
SUCCESSFUL, HE HAS ARGUED IN 

1773
01:15:00,695 --> 01:15:01,897
THE PAST, WHICH IS HIS GUT AND 

1774
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,231
INSTINCT, HE SAID THIS WE CAN, 

1775
01:15:03,231 --> 01:15:03,966
HE WOULD KNOW WITHIN A MINUTE 

1776
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:06,101
OR SO, WHETHER CHAIRMAN KIM WAS 

1777
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:07,970
SERIOUS ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS, 

1778
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:08,937
BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN 

1779
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:10,839
TODAY, SOME LEVEL OF 

1780
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,040
SERIOUSNESS, DISPLAYED BY THE 

1781
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,142
CHAIRMAN, THAT ALLOWED 

1782
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:15,010
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO MOVE FORWARD 

1783
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,778
WITH HIS AGENDA. 

1784
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:18,080
IT DOES SEEM INTERESTING, THAT 

1785
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:22,250
AS HE POINTED OUT, THE NORTH 

1786
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,685
KOREANS, ONCE THEY HAD THE 

1787
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:29,958
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY, ONCE THEY 

1788
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:30,659
HAD A NUCLEAR WEAPON THAT WAS 

1789
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:31,693
ABLE TO BE PLACED ON A 

1790
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:32,260
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 

1791
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:32,894
MISSILE AGAINST UNITED STATES, 

1792
01:15:32,894 --> 01:15:39,034
CHAIRMAN KIM SAID NOW WE CAN 

1793
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,302
TALK, NOW WE WANT TO FOCUS ON 

1794
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:41,402
THE ECONOMY, WHICH IS WHERE THE 

1795
01:15:41,402 --> 01:15:41,970
UNITED STATES COMES IN. 

1796
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,004
TO PROVIDE RELIEF BY REMOVING 

1797
01:15:43,004 --> 01:15:43,305
SANCTIONS. 

1798
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:45,974
YOU SEE IT THAT WAY AS A 

1799
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,010
STRATEGIC MOVE, BY THE NORTH 

1800
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:50,545
KOREANS, AS OPPOSED TO ONE DONE 

1801
01:15:50,545 --> 01:15:52,748
BY THE MEDIATION BY SOUTH KOREA 

1802
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:54,916
AND CHINA?

1803
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:56,451
>> IT IS HARD TO KNOW HOW MUCH 

1804
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,854
CREDIT TO GIVE THE NORTH KOREANS

1805
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:06,261
, A SHAMBOLIC POLITY ON SO MANY 

1806
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:07,696
LEVELS, THEY HAVE DONE A LOT OF 

1807
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:08,429
SOPHISTICATED NEGOTIATIONS THE 

1808
01:16:08,429 --> 01:16:14,336
PAST, IS THIS A CAREFUL PLAN BY 

1809
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:15,304
KIM JONG-UN OVER THESE LAST 

1810
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:15,904
YEARS, THE BEST WAY TO TAKE 

1811
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,038
ADVANTAGE OF THE NINE STATES, 

1812
01:16:17,038 --> 01:16:18,206
OR HAVE THEY BEEN STEP-BY-STEP 

1813
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:24,312
SAYING, THIS IS WHERE WE ARE 

1814
01:16:24,312 --> 01:16:25,681
RIGHT NOW, LET'S IMPROVISE, USE 

1815
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:26,381
WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US, 

1816
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:28,082
AND MAKE THE MOST OF A BAD 

1817
01:16:28,082 --> 01:16:29,618
SITUATION. 

1818
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,420
>> THE PRESIDENT IS KNOWN AS AN 

1819
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,054
IMPROVISER, A DISRUPTOR, COULD 

1820
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:33,455
IT BE THAT THIS COULD ONLY 

1821
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:34,690
HAPPEN BETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUALS, 

1822
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:37,759
I'M NOT COMPARING PRESIDENT 

1823
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,796
TRUMP TO A BRUTAL DICTATOR, BUT 

1824
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:41,429
THE IDEA OF THE PERSONALITY OF 

1825
01:16:41,429 --> 01:16:42,263
THESE INDIVIDUALS, 

1826
01:16:42,263 --> 01:16:43,464
UNPREDICTABLE, SORT OF 

1827
01:16:43,464 --> 01:16:51,272
INSTINCTUAL, IS THAT SOMETHING 

1828
01:16:51,272 --> 01:16:52,207
THAT PERHAPS MIGHT'VE PLAYED 

1829
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:52,507
INTO THIS? 

1830
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:53,375
>> I THINK IT CERTAINLY DID, 

1831
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,209
BUT I THINK IT WOULD CERTAINLY 

1832
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:55,077
BE POSSIBLE THAT ANOTHER U.S. 

1833
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:55,977
PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE DECIDED TO 

1834
01:16:55,977 --> 01:16:56,777
MEET WITH A NORTH KOREAN 

1835
01:16:56,777 --> 01:16:57,646
LEADER, BILL CLINTON CAME VERY 

1836
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:01,249
CLOSE, THE CLOSEST, IN 2000, 

1837
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:05,220
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT WENT TO 

1838
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,420
PYONGYANG, SHE MET WITH HIS 

1839
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:09,724
FATHER, AND CLINTON WAS VERY 

1840
01:17:09,724 --> 01:17:11,159
CLOSE TO GOING, BUT HE DECIDED 

1841
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:12,059
TO FOCUS ON ISRAEL AND 

1842
01:17:12,059 --> 01:17:16,698
PALESTINE, ANOTHER VERY 

1843
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:19,901
DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO SOLVE. 

1844
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:21,236
AND HE LOST THE CHANCE TO BE 

1845
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,071
THE FIRST U.S. PRESIDENT TO BE 

1846
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,472
WITH A SITTING NORTH KOREAN 

1847
01:17:24,472 --> 01:17:27,109
LEADER. 

1848
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,110
SO INSTEAD, WE HAVE TRUMP DOING 

1849
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,878
THAT, AND I THINK IT WAS TRUMP 

1850
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:34,149
DECIDING SOME HUBRIS, PERHAPS 

1851
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,050
SOME GOOD JUDGMENT INVOLVED 

1852
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:35,717
SOMEWHERE, BUT DECIDING THE WAY 

1853
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:37,552
TO SOLVE THIS, IS FOR ME TO SIT 

1854
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:39,221
DOWN AND MEET WITH THE NORTH 

1855
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:48,864
KOREAN LEADER.>> WHEN WE GET TO 

1856
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:49,531
THE LANGUAGE OF THIS 

1857
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:50,265
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, AS THE 

1858
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,099
PRESIDENT CALLED IT, I'M SURE 

1859
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:52,000
ANALYSTS WHO HAVE STUDIED THE 

1860
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,068
REGION CLOSELY FOR MANY YEARS, 

1861
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:53,668
THAT WILL BE LOOKING FOR 

1862
01:17:53,668 --> 01:17:55,170
SIMILAR LANGUAGE IN OTHER 

1863
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,238
AGREEMENTS, THAT THE NORTH 

1864
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:56,938
KOREANS HAVE SIGNED WITH THE 

1865
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:57,305
UNITED STATES. 

1866
01:17:57,305 --> 01:18:00,442
HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO TELL, I 

1867
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:04,946
WILL BE ABLE TO TELL, IT WILL 

1868
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:06,248
BE NEW TO ME, BUT WHAT WILL YOU 

1869
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:06,948
BE LOOKING FOR THAT WILL GIVE 

1870
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:08,183
YOU SOME INDICATION THAT THIS 

1871
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,751
IS A SERIOUS MOVE BY THE NORTH 

1872
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:10,719
KOREANS, OR WE HAVE SEEN THIS 

1873
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,454
IN THE PAST, IN 1994, AND THESE 

1874
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:16,558
ARE THE TIMES?

1875
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:17,491
>> FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY 

1876
01:18:17,491 --> 01:18:18,293
GATES SAID YOU DON'T WANT TO 

1877
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:20,395
BUY THE SECOND HORSE, WILL 

1878
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,898
WOULD BE BUYING A HORSE FOR THE 

1879
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:27,769
THIRD TIME. 

1880
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:29,004
-- WILL WE BE BUYING A HORSE 

1881
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:29,638
FOR THE THIRD TIME? 

1882
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:30,605
THE LEVEL OF DETAIL, THE 

1883
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:33,908
GUIDELINES, THE GUIDE RAILS, AS 

1884
01:18:33,908 --> 01:18:34,843
TO HOW THIS AGREEMENT IS GOING 

1885
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:36,344
TO BE ENFORCED. 

1886
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,180
THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF TIME 

1887
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:44,252
TO PUT THIS TOGETHER, I WILL BE 

1888
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:45,287
VERY SURPRISED IF THIS IS A 

1889
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:45,820
DETAILED PLAN TOWARDS 

1890
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:46,755
DENUCLEARIZATION, BUT WHAT I 

1891
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:47,923
WILL BE LOOKING FOR IS 

1892
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,959
SOMETHING THAT SHOWS THAT THIS 

1893
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:51,559
IS UNPRECEDENTED, SOMETHING 

1894
01:18:51,559 --> 01:18:53,061
LIKE A CESSATION OF THE KOREAN 

1895
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,429
WAR, AS OPPOSED TO TWO SIDES 

1896
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:55,864
AGREED TO DO THIS, THEY ARE 

1897
01:18:55,864 --> 01:19:02,470
ACTUALLY DOING THIS. 

1898
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:03,471
WE ARE TAKING THE STEP, AS 

1899
01:19:03,471 --> 01:19:04,506
OPPOSED TO WE AGREED TO TAKE 

1900
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:05,140
THE STEP. 

1901
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:05,940
>> THAT IS A GOOD POINT, 

1902
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:08,176
BECAUSE FOR ME, WHEN WE 

1903
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:09,611
ULTIMATELY GET THE WORDING OF 

1904
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:16,451
THIS DOCUMENT, AND UNDERSTAND 

1905
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:18,019
WHAT IS IN IT, IS WELL, THEY 

1906
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:19,254
HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE, THIS IS 

1907
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,056
NOT NEW. 

1908
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:22,257
WHAT WOULD HAVE TO BE NEW? 

1909
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:23,525
VERIFICATION, ALLOWING 

1910
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:27,896
SPECTERS, -- INSPECTORS, 

1911
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:28,529
FREEZING OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS 

1912
01:19:28,529 --> 01:19:28,796
PROGRAM? 

1913
01:19:28,796 --> 01:19:30,832
WHAT WOULD BE NEW?

1914
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:31,733
>> THEY HAVE ALLOWED INSPECTORS 

1915
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:34,602
IN THE PAST, TEAM AMERICA, HANS 

1916
01:19:34,602 --> 01:19:38,006
BLIX, THAT WHOLE THING, THE END 

1917
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:39,674
OF THE KOREAN WAR, THAT WOULD 

1918
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:42,910
BE NEW, VERY CONCRETE STEPS, 

1919
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:43,912
THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE ARE 

1920
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:45,280
GOING TO IN THE KOREAN WAR. 

1921
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,247
NORMALIZING DIPLOMATIC 

1922
01:19:46,247 --> 01:19:48,150
RELATIONS, THAT WOULD BE NEW. 

1923
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:51,453
THAT WOULD BE HUGE. 

1924
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,387
OR THE AGREEMENT, KIM JONG-UN 

1925
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:57,225
AT THIS POINT IS GOING TO COME 

1926
01:19:57,225 --> 01:19:58,393
TO THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR A STATE 

1927
01:19:58,393 --> 01:19:59,694
VISIT, THAT WOULD BE VERY BIG, 

1928
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:03,999
CERTAINLY A VERY FAR WAY FOR 

1929
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:05,233
KIM JONG-UN TO TRAVEL, 

1930
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:07,035
UNPRECEDENTED. 

1931
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,738
>> THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING IT'S 

1932
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:10,372
GOING TO HAPPEN, HE SAID THAT 

1933
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:11,872
HE EXPECTS THAT THEY WILL BE 

1934
01:20:11,872 --> 01:20:13,808
MEETING, MEANING HIMSELF AND 

1935
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:16,378
CHAIRMAN KIM, AGAIN, AND HE 

1936
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:19,714
SAID MANY TIMES. 

1937
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:23,184
YOU KNOW, NO COUNTRY THAT HAS 

1938
01:20:23,184 --> 01:20:24,885
HAD THE KIND OF REGIME THAT KIM 

1939
01:20:24,885 --> 01:20:28,623
HAS, HAS EVER VISITED THE WHITE 

1940
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:32,727
HOUSE, SADDAM HUSSEIN, QADDAFI, 

1941
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:33,461
THOSE OTHER BRUTAL DICTATORS. 

1942
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:34,996
THAT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS STEP 

1943
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:38,900
FOR SURE.

1944
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:39,901
>> IT IS INTERESTING, WE HAVE 

1945
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:40,801
SEEN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE HAD 

1946
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:42,370
HORRIFIC REGIMES EVOLVE INTO 

1947
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:43,772
ALLIES OF THE UNITED STATES, 

1948
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:44,739
JAPAN IS A GREAT EXAMPLE, NOT 

1949
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:50,478
VERY LONG AFTER THE APPLICATION 

1950
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:52,213
OF THE EMPEROR, AND THE FALL OF 

1951
01:20:52,213 --> 01:20:55,951
THAT GOVERNMENT, THE U.S. AND 

1952
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:56,785
JAPAN HAD QUITE A GOOD 

1953
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:57,118
RELATIONSHIP. 

1954
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:57,719
GERMANY IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE. 

1955
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:01,623
BUT A LEADER WHO HAS BEEN ON 

1956
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:01,956
BOTH SIDES. 

1957
01:21:01,956 --> 01:21:04,926
>>> STANDBY, WE EXPECT THAT 

1958
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:06,328
THERE IS GOING TO BE A PRESS 

1959
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:07,695

OUR VIEWERS A PRESS CONFERENCE,

AND CHAIRMAN KIM OF NORTH 

1974
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:47,015
KOREA, WE ARE EXPECTING THE 

1975
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:47,882
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES TO 

1976
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:48,917
GIVE A PRESS CONFERENCE TO GIVE 

1977
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:49,683
DETAILS OF THE COMPREHENSIVE 

1978
01:24:49,683 --> 01:24:52,153
DOCUMENT HE SIGNED, JUST ABOUT 

1979
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:52,786
HALF AN HOUR AGO, THE PRESIDENT 

1980
01:24:52,786 --> 01:24:55,757
SAID IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE 

1981
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:56,424
DOCUMENT, WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAD 

1982
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:59,460
WORKED ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME, 

1983
01:24:59,460 --> 01:24:59,994
NO DETAILS YET, BUT SOME 

1984
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:01,362
DETAILS ARE EKING THEIR WAY 

1985
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:01,562
OUT. 

1986
01:25:01,562 --> 01:25:03,698
I AM JOINED HERE BY ISAAC STONE

FISH,  ISAAC, YOU ARE SEEING 

1988
01:25:06,433 --> 01:25:08,903
FROM SOME SOURCES THAT SOME OF 

1989
01:25:08,903 --> 01:25:11,940
THOSE DETAILS ARE COMING OUT, 

1990
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,007
AND WHAT IS YOUR FIRST THOUGHT? 

1991
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:14,142
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD? 

1992
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:16,444
>> THEY SEEM TO BE QUITE VAGUE 

1993
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:21,950
SO FAR, BOTH SIDES AGREE, NONE 

1994
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:22,817
OF THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, 

1995
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:24,018
WHAT WE THINK WE ARE SEEING IS 

1996
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:25,185
THEY AGREED TO WORK TOWARDS 

1997
01:25:25,185 --> 01:25:25,753
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION,

AGREE TO EXCHANGE OPINIONS, A 

1999
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:33,628
LOT OF LANGUAGE LIKE THAT, I 

2000
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:34,629
COULD BE PROVEN WRONG, AND JUST 

2001
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:35,662
A FEW MINUTES, BUT IT REALLY 

2002
01:25:35,662 --> 01:25:37,565
SEEMS TO BE A WHOLE LOT OF 

2003
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:40,301
NOTHING. 

2004
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:41,736
WHEN IT COMES TO THE AGREEMENTS 

2005
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:42,370
THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH NORTH 

2006
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:42,970
KOREA IN THE PAST. 

2007
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:46,774
>> LET'S GO TO ZEKE MILLER, 

2008
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:47,642

THIS DOCUMENT THAT THE 

2016
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:57,651
PRESIDENT SAID WAS 

2017
01:25:57,651 --> 01:26:01,990
COMPREHENSIVE?>> THE TIME OF 

2018
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,358
THE PRESS CONFERENCE, IT WON'T 

2019
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:08,163

01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:10,265
A NEW UPDATED TIMING. 

2022
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:11,231
ON THE DOCUMENT, WE ARE SEEING 

2023
01:26:11,231 --> 01:26:12,800
THE FIRST PAGE, THAT WAS 

2024
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,869
CAPTURED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS, THE 

2025
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:18,840
STATE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT 

2026
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,674
PROVIDED A ADDITIONAL READOUT, 

2027
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:23,478
BLURRY ZOOM IN PHOTOS, WE ARE 

2028
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:24,678
REPORTING THAT WE CAN FIGURE 

2029
01:26:24,678 --> 01:26:26,748
OUT SOMETHING OF WHAT WAS SAID, 

2030
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:31,085
IT APPEARS TO BE VERY VAGUE 

2031
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:36,024
AGREEMENTS, BULLET POINTS, ON 

2032
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,593
ONE PAGE OR PATIENT HAVE, THE 

2033
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:43,063
NORTH IS AGREEING TO STANDBY 

2034
01:26:43,063 --> 01:26:44,199
ITS DECLARATION TO BEGIN THE 

2035
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:45,133
PROCESS OF DENUCLEARIZATION, 

2036
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:49,504
BUT NO TIMEFRAME, A DISCUSSION 

2037
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:52,873
OF ACCOUNTING FOR TROOPS WHO 

2038
01:26:52,873 --> 01:26:57,912
ARE MIA FROM THE KOREAN WAR, AND

2039
01:26:57,912 --> 01:26:59,314
AS WELL, THERE IS A SECURITY 

2040
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:00,348
COMMITMENT FROM UNITED STATES 

2041
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:03,150
NORTH KOREA, THE PEACE AND 

2042
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:11,426
PROSPERITY, IF IT GOES THROUGH. 

2043
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:12,894
THAT IS BASICALLY ALL WE HAVE 

2044
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:13,728
LEARNED, WE ARE YET TO HEAR 

2045
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:19,934
MORE FROM THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF,

2046
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:21,302
WHAT WAS BEHIND THE AGREEMENT 

2047
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:22,070
AS WELL IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 

2048
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:22,303
HOURS. 

2049
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:23,338
>> IN FACT, Z, WE ARE SHOWING 

2050
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:24,972
AN IMAGE THERE, AS THE 

2051
01:27:24,972 --> 01:27:25,740
PRESIDENT HAS THIS HABIT OF 

2052
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:26,941
HOLDING OF DOCUMENTS THAT HE 

2053
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:28,142
SIGNS FOR THE PRESS, IIC, AND 

2054
01:27:28,142 --> 01:27:29,743
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING 

2055
01:27:29,743 --> 01:27:33,114
TO, WE CAN SEE SOME OF THE 

2056
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:34,114
THINGS YOU JUST INDICATED, THE 

2057
01:27:34,114 --> 01:27:37,418
FOUR BULLET POINTS, A COUPLE OF 

2058
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:38,119
PARAGRAPHS, FOLLOWED BY THE 

2059
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:39,420
SIGNATURES OF PRESIDENT TRUMP 

2060
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,389
AND CHAIRMAN KIM, THE LANGUAGE 

2061
01:27:42,389 --> 01:27:43,457
THAT IS USED, IN THE DOCUMENT, 

2062
01:27:43,457 --> 01:27:47,395
SOME OF THE SOURCES ON SOCIAL 

2063
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:55,770
MEDIA, COMMIT, THEY COMMIT TO 

2064
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:56,904
DOING SOMETHING, THAT HAS NOT, 

2065
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:57,838
AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, NOTHING 

2066
01:27:57,838 --> 01:27:58,406
CONCRETE ESTABLISHED THAT 

2067
01:27:58,406 --> 01:28:00,408
DOCUMENT THAT WE HAD ON THE 

2068
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:01,008
SCREEN.>> EXACTLY RIGHT, THIS 

2069
01:28:01,008 --> 01:28:02,343
IS SOMETHING THE NORTH HAS DONE 

2070
01:28:02,343 --> 01:28:03,611
BEFORE, A COMMITMENT TO GO 

2071
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:04,912
ABOUT A PROCESS IS VERY 

2072
01:28:04,912 --> 01:28:08,416
DIFFERENT TO AN AGREEMENT ON 

2073
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:11,418
THE SUBSTANCE, IT IS VERY BARE-

2074
01:28:11,418 --> 01:28:12,387
BONES. 

2075
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:15,556
THE SORT OF THING THAT TO 

2076
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:16,256
DIPLOMATS, IN A ROOM ANYWHERE 

2077
01:28:16,256 --> 01:28:21,029
COULD ESTABLISH A PROCESS. 

2078
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:21,863
JUST COMING OUT OF THE MEETING 

2079
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:23,464
BETWEEN TWO LEADERS LIKE THIS, 

2080
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:29,303
IT WONDERS WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

2081
01:28:29,303 --> 01:28:29,904
ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED IN THE 

2082
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:30,671
SITDOWN, THE NORTH HAS GOTTEN 

2083
01:28:30,671 --> 01:28:32,206
TO THIS POINT BEFORE, IT HAS 

2084
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:35,076
COMMITTED TO THIS, BUT HASN'T 

2085
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:35,510
FOLLOWED THROUGH. 

2086
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:41,182
THAT WILL BE THE REAL QUESTION. 

2087
01:28:41,182 --> 01:28:42,049
A HISTORIC AGREEMENT, WE HEARD 

2088
01:28:42,049 --> 01:28:43,084
THAT FROM HIM, AT THE PRESS 

2089
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:43,918
CONFERENCE HE WILL PROBABLY SAY 

2090
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:45,485
THAT, BUT HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT 

2091
01:28:45,485 --> 01:28:46,354
FROM OTHER TIMES, WHAT 

2092
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:47,187
ASSURANCES CAN THE PRESIDENT 

2093
01:28:47,187 --> 01:28:48,822
GIVE, NOT JUST TO THE AMERICAN 

2094
01:28:48,822 --> 01:28:52,193
PEOPLE, BUT THE PEOPLE OF THIS 

2095
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:53,060
REGION, WHO LIVE EVERY DAY 

2096
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,862
UNDER THE THREAT OF A NUCLEAR 

2097
01:28:54,862 --> 01:29:01,002
UMBRELLA, AND A THREAT FROM 

2098
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:07,308
NORTH KOREA, HOW IS THIS 

2099
01:29:07,308 --> 01:29:08,175
DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST SEVERAL 

2100
01:29:08,175 --> 01:29:09,043
TIMES THAT THE NORTH HAS 

2101
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:10,044
COMMITTED TO DO THIS VERY THING 

2102
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:10,912
THAT THEY COMMITTED TO DO 

2103
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,914
TODAY?>> AND SEEK, OVER THE 

2104
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:23,524
COURSE -- SEEK -- ZEKE, WE HAVE 

2105
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:27,928
TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS 

2106
01:29:27,928 --> 01:29:29,096
THAT THEY HAVE TRIED TO END THE 

2107
01:29:29,096 --> 01:29:29,630
HOSTILITIES THAT EXISTED 

2108
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:31,098
BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES FOR 

2109
01:29:31,098 --> 01:29:31,833
DECADES, HAVING COVERED THE G7 

2110
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:37,371
SUMMIT, THIS WE CAN, AND THEN 

2111
01:29:37,371 --> 01:29:38,372
FLYING ON TO SINGAPORE TO SEE 

2112
01:29:38,372 --> 01:29:39,473
THIS, SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT 

2113
01:29:39,473 --> 01:29:40,307
THE PRESIDENT USED WITH REGARDS 

2114
01:29:40,307 --> 01:29:41,943
TO KIM JONG-UN OVER THE COURSE 

2115
01:29:41,943 --> 01:29:44,912
OF TODAY, AFTER THE SIGNING OF 

2116
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:49,851
THIS DOCUMENT, CALLED HIM A 

2117
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:50,518
WORTHY NEGOTIATOR, A TALENTED 

2118
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:51,919
MAN, HE SAID THAT THE MEETING 

2119
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:53,020
WAS FANTASTIC, AND HE SORT OF 

2120
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:54,922
PRAISED KIM JONG-UN, AND WE 

2121
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:58,860
KNOW THIS IS A BRUTAL DICTATOR 

2122
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,161
WHO HAS KILLED HIS OWN PEOPLE, 

2123
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:04,599
STARVED HIS OWN PEOPLE, STARVED 

2124
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:05,266
ANYONE WHO HAS DISAGREED WITH 

2125
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:06,634
HIM, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF HIS 

2126
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,135
OWN FAMILY, CONTRAST THAT WITH 

2127
01:30:08,135 --> 01:30:09,436
WHAT YOU WITNESSED AT THE G7, 

2128
01:30:09,436 --> 01:30:12,240
WITH THE PRESIDENT SAYING FROM 

2129
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,910
THE COMFORT OF AIR FORCE ONE, 

2130
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:16,844
ABOUT OUR CLOSEST ALLIES, 

2131
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:19,146
INCLUDING CANADA AND FRANCE, 

2132
01:30:19,146 --> 01:30:20,214
CERTAINLY A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

2133
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:28,790
ABOUT THAT I'M GUESSING. 

2134
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:29,657
GIVE THE LANGUAGE THAT HE USED 

2135
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:30,791
WITH THIS DICTATOR, AND THE 

2136
01:30:30,791 --> 01:30:31,425
LANGUAGE THAT HE HAS USED ON 

2137
01:30:31,425 --> 01:30:32,460
SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER 

2138
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:36,330
PLATFORMS WITH CLOSE ALLIES WHO 

2139
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:37,632
HAVE BEEN ALLIES FOR MANY 

2140
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:38,232
YEARS, AS THE CANADIANS HAVE 

2141
01:30:38,232 --> 01:30:38,833
INDICATED, 40,000 CANADIAN 

2142
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:39,967
TROOPS FOUGHT ALONG THE UNITED 

2143
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:42,736
STATES -- ALONG WITH UNITED 

2144
01:30:42,736 --> 01:30:44,071
STATES OVER THE COURSE OF THOSE 

2145
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:48,576
YEARS.>> THERE IS THIS GENERAL 

2146
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:49,610
SENSE OF THE PRESIDENT USING A 

2147
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:51,212
DIFFERENT TONE TO DISCUSS 

2148
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:54,549
ALLIES, AND PRAISING LEADERS OF 

2149
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:59,921
OPPRESSIVE REGIMES. 

2150
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:00,788
SAYING THAT KIM JONG-UN CARES 

2151
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:01,789
ABOUT HIS PEOPLE, MANY OF HIS 

2152
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:05,425
PEOPLE ARE STARVING, IN FORCED 

2153
01:31:05,425 --> 01:31:06,260
LABOR CAMPS, AND HAVE BEEN 

2154
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:06,960
KILLED BY HIS BRUTAL 

2155
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:07,261
GOVERNMENT. 

2156
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:10,364
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE 

2157
01:31:10,364 --> 01:31:11,765
PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT 

2158
01:31:11,765 --> 01:31:12,600
FOR. 

2159
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:18,940
SOME OFFICIALS HAS SAID -- HAVE 

2160
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:19,840
SAID THAT THE CAMPAIGN PROMISE, 

2161
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:23,978
AMERICA FIRST, IN THIS CASE, 

2162
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:25,012
THE WAY THE WHITE HOUSE APPEARS 

2163
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:27,915
TO BE JUST FINE THE RHETORIC, 

2164
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:28,950
IS IN THE HOPES OF MAYBE 

2165
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:33,754
SECURING A NUCLEAR AGREEMENT, 

2166
01:31:33,754 --> 01:31:34,788
IT'S OKAY TO USE THIS LANGUAGE 

2167
01:31:34,788 --> 01:31:35,523
TO DESCRIBE AN AUTOCRATIC 

2168
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:38,926
LEADER LIKE KIM JONG-UN, AND AT 

2169
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:40,060
THE SAME TIME, TO USE THE 

2170
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:40,694
NEGATIVE LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE 

2171
01:31:40,694 --> 01:31:42,095
FRIENDS AND ALLIES, LIKE THE 

2172
01:31:42,095 --> 01:31:42,996
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER AND THE 

2173
01:31:42,996 --> 01:31:43,631
LEADERSHIP. 

2174
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:47,935
THEY BELIEVE THAT IT IS PART OF 

2175
01:31:47,935 --> 01:31:49,036
HIS NEGOTIATING STYLE, THE 

2176
01:31:49,036 --> 01:31:51,938
DEVIL WILL BE CAN HE DELIVER ON 

2177
01:31:51,938 --> 01:31:55,676
IT? 

2178
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:56,576
HE HAS A PRO FORMA AGREEMENT 

2179
01:31:56,576 --> 01:32:01,983
FROM KIM JONG-UN, HE HAS 

2180
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:02,950
WAGERED SO MUCH ON THIS, WHAT 

2181
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:03,684
IS THE COST OF USING THIS 

2182
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:04,885
RHETORIC TO DESCRIBE THESE 

2183
01:32:04,885 --> 01:32:05,152
LEADERS? 

2184
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:06,587
THAT IS AN ANSWER THAT WE WILL 

2185
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:08,155
KNOW TODAY OR TOMORROW, MAYBE 

2186
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:13,894
NOT THIS YEAR, A LONGER 

2187
01:32:13,894 --> 01:32:14,461
QUESTION ABOUT THE NATION'S 

2188
01:32:14,461 --> 01:32:15,061
CREDIBILITY IF THE PRESIDENT 

2189
01:32:15,061 --> 01:32:16,030
CAN'T DELIVER ON THESE 

2190
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:16,897
AGREEMENTS, IF THE RHETORIC 

2191
01:32:16,897 --> 01:32:18,099
DOESN'T RESULT IN THIS 

2192
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:22,570
AGREEMENT.

2193
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,737

01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:18,426
>> THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. 

2220
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:19,026
THE QUESTION IS, IS THERE AN 

2221
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:20,127
ANNEX TO THIS, SOME OTHER 

2222
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:22,363

THEY ONLY MET FOR SEVERAL HOURS,

2226
01:33:28,302 --> 01:33:37,945
IF THIS WAS JUST THE END RESULT,

2227
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:38,946
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THEY 

2228
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:39,546
HAVE EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS, 

2229
01:33:39,546 --> 01:33:40,380
THIS IS NOT, THIS IS BARE-

2230
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:41,315
BONES, WHAT A MEETING LIKE THIS 

2231

HALF, IT PROMISE THAT HAS BEEN 

2233
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:53,260
MADE BEFORE, THE QUESTION IS, 

2234
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,028
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE? 

2235
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:54,728
THAT IS SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT 

2236
01:33:54,728 --> 01:33:55,862
WILL BE QUESTIONED ON WHEN HE 

2237
01:33:55,862 --> 01:33:56,597

SUMMIT, HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED THE 

2245
01:34:17,384 --> 01:34:18,119
SUMMIT, BUT WHEN YOU SEE SOME 

2246
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:19,186
OF THE LANGUAGE WE ARE SEEING 

2247
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:19,854
FROM THIS DOCUMENT, THE 

2248
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:20,821
PRESIDENT CALLED A 

2249
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:23,024
COMPREHENSIVE, THAT THIS IS 

2250
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:23,624
SOMETHING THAT THE WORLD WILL 

2251
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:25,025
SEE IS A MAJOR CHANGE, 

2252
01:34:25,025 --> 01:34:26,460
SOMETHING THAT KIM SAID, A 

2253
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:29,663
FANTASTIC MEETING, LOTS OF 

2254
01:34:29,663 --> 01:34:30,230
PROGRESS, COMPREHENSIVE 

2255

DOCUMENT, AND HE IS TO PROVIDE 

2256
01:34:34,434 --> 01:34:35,536
SECURITY GUARANTEES, AND 

2257
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:38,004
CHAIRMAN KIM REAFFIRMED HIS 

2258
01:34:38,004 --> 01:34:40,140
FIRM AND UNWAVERING COMMITMENT. 

2259
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:45,112
HAS HE REAFFIRMED ANYTHING? 

2260
01:34:45,112 --> 01:34:48,115
HE HAS NEVER HAD A COMMITMENT TO

2261
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:49,283
DENUCLEARIZE THE KOREAN 

2262
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:49,884
PENINSULA. 

2263
01:34:49,884 --> 01:34:55,256
>> IF THIS ENTIRE EVENING HAS 

2264
01:34:55,256 --> 01:34:56,056
BEEN AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER 

2265
01:34:56,056 --> 01:34:57,324
COASTER, WE ARE WAY DOWN HERE, 

2266
01:34:57,324 --> 01:35:01,662
THIS WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. 

2267
01:35:01,662 --> 01:35:02,463
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY 

2268
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:04,331
REASONABLE TO GO TO THIS AND 

2269
01:35:04,331 --> 01:35:06,066
SAY LISTEN, WE HAD A MEETING, 

2270
01:35:06,066 --> 01:35:07,268
IT'S GREAT THAT WE MET, WE GOT 

2271
01:35:07,268 --> 01:35:08,302
TO KNOW EACH OTHER, NOT MUCH 

2272
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:10,538
CAME OUT OF IT, FINE. 

2273
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:12,406
THEN WE SEE THIS DOCUMENT, AND 

2274
01:35:12,406 --> 01:35:16,577
OKAY GREAT, A FIRST STEP, THEY 

2275
01:35:16,577 --> 01:35:17,277
MET, WE DIDN'T GET ANYTHING 

2276
01:35:17,277 --> 01:35:23,117
THAT WE WERE EXPECTING. 

2277
01:35:23,117 --> 01:35:24,151
BUT YOU HAVE TRUMP SING THIS 

2278
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:25,586
WOULD BETTER THAN ANYONE COULD 

2279
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:27,588
HAVE EXPECTED, I EXPECTED IT TO 

2280
01:35:27,588 --> 01:35:30,224
GO BETTER, IT WENT WORSE. 

2281
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:31,358
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE FELT THE 

2282
01:35:31,358 --> 01:35:33,393
NEED TO LIE TO US ABOUT THE 

2283
01:35:33,393 --> 01:35:34,295
QUALITY OF WHAT WAS GOING TO 

2284
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:36,563
COME OUT OF THAT, JUST A 

2285
01:35:36,563 --> 01:35:37,765
MEETING WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH. 

2286
01:35:37,765 --> 01:35:43,437
>> WE ARE WAITING FOR THE 

2287
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:44,037
ENTIRETY OF THE DOCUMENT, WE 

2288
01:35:44,037 --> 01:35:44,938
ARE SHOWING BASICALLY A SCREEN 

2289
01:35:44,938 --> 01:35:46,373
GRAB, AGAIN, TO GIVE THE 

2290
01:35:46,373 --> 01:35:51,946
PRESIDENT THE BENEFIT, PERHAPS 

2291
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:52,679
IN HIS MIND THIS IS SOMETHING 

2292
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:53,347
COMPREHENSIVE, SOMETHING THAT 

2293
01:35:53,347 --> 01:35:56,617
HE WAS GOING FOR, BECAUSE HE 

2294
01:35:56,617 --> 01:35:57,952
TENDS TO USE THAT KIND OF 

2295
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,552
RHETORIC, SOMETHING THAT WE 

2296
01:35:58,552 --> 01:35:59,453
HAVE COME TO EXPECT, HIS 

2297
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:00,221
SUPPORTERS, HE SAYS THINGS GOT 

2298
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:02,823
NOT EXACTLY WHAT IS IN THE 

2299
01:36:02,823 --> 01:36:04,525
LETTER OF THE LETTER, OF THIS 

2300
01:36:04,525 --> 01:36:07,795
DOCUMENT, BUT IN HIS MIND, THIS 

2301
01:36:07,795 --> 01:36:09,196
IS A WIN. 

2302
01:36:09,196 --> 01:36:10,698
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO BE WITH 

2303
01:36:10,698 --> 01:36:19,106
THIS LEADER, AND HE HAS, AND 

2304
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:20,173
THERE IS THIS DOCUMENT, FOR HIM 

2305
01:36:20,173 --> 01:36:21,575
IT IS KIND OF A THING HE IS 

2306
01:36:21,575 --> 01:36:22,910
EXPECTING A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL 

2307
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:23,711
APPLAUD THEM FOR, BECAUSE NO 

2308
01:36:23,711 --> 01:36:25,045
ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET THIS 

2309
01:36:25,045 --> 01:36:26,013
DONE BEFORE.>> TO HIM, HE JUST 

2310
01:36:26,013 --> 01:36:29,483
HAPPENS TO BE WRONG ON THIS. 

2311
01:36:29,483 --> 01:36:30,851
AND LIE WAS NOT A FAIR WORD, WE 

2312
01:36:30,851 --> 01:36:32,953
DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS INTENTIONS 

2313
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:35,856
WERE, BUT I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO 

2314
01:36:35,856 --> 01:36:38,091
FULLY PROCESS AND ANALYZE THIS. 

2315
01:36:38,091 --> 01:36:39,693
JUST WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 

2316
01:36:39,693 --> 01:36:40,461
SEE FROM THE SCREEN GRAB THAT 

2317
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:41,996
IS ON SCREEN RIGHT NOW, THAT 

2318
01:36:41,996 --> 01:36:45,432
DOCUMENT COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNED 

2319
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:46,267
BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND NORTH 

2320
01:36:46,267 --> 01:36:50,070
KOREA FIVE OR 10 YEARS AGO. 

2321
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:51,104
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VIEWED 

2322
01:36:51,104 --> 01:36:52,339
AS A MODEST BREAKTHROUGH. 

2323
01:36:52,339 --> 01:36:54,775
AND NOW, AFTER THIS MASSIVE 

2324
01:36:54,775 --> 01:36:56,810
SUMMIT, UNPRECEDENTED MEETING 

2325
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:59,780
BETWEEN THE TWO DEALERS -- 

2326
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:06,086
LEADERS, THE FACT THAT WE SEEM 

2327
01:37:06,086 --> 01:37:07,288
TO BE IN EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE 

2328
01:37:07,288 --> 01:37:08,122
THAT WE WERE BEFORE, IS 

2329
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:08,489
DISAPPOINTING. 

2330
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:16,530
>> THIS WILL ALL BE VIEWED WITH 

2331
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:17,564
THE PRISM OF POLITICS IN THIS 

2332
01:37:17,564 --> 01:37:18,898
COUNTRY, AS IT ALWAYS IS, A LOT 

2333
01:37:18,898 --> 01:37:20,234
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTERS OF 

2334
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:20,935
THE PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF HIS 

2335
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:24,238
OWN PARTY, WILL LOOK TO THE 

2336
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:24,771
PRESENCE TWEET BEFORE THE 

2337
01:37:24,771 --> 01:37:25,572
MEETING, WHERE HE CALLED THE 

2338
01:37:25,572 --> 01:37:26,272
LOSERS THE HATERS, THOSE WHO 

2339
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,240
DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM SUCCEED 

2340
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:27,908
ESSENTIALLY, THIS IS SOMETHING 

2341
01:37:27,908 --> 01:37:29,442
THAT HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO 

2342
01:37:29,442 --> 01:37:31,011
ACCOMPLISH, AND BECAUSE PEOPLE 

2343
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:37,117
ARE SO CRITICAL OF HIM AND HIS 

2344
01:37:37,117 --> 01:37:37,751
ADMINISTRATION, THEY ARE GOING 

2345
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:38,986
TO CRITICIZE THIS, NO MATTER 

2346
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:43,457
THE RESULT. 

2347
01:37:43,457 --> 01:37:44,258
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE 

2348
01:37:44,258 --> 01:37:45,092
ARE SOME CONSERVATIVES WHO HAVE 

2349
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:45,625
ALWAYS CAUTIONED AGAINST 

2350
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:46,493
MEETING WITH NORTH KOREA, 

2351
01:37:46,493 --> 01:37:47,928
WITHOUT ANYTHING SIGNED BEFORE 

2352
01:37:47,928 --> 01:37:50,230
THE ACTUAL MEETING. 

2353
01:37:50,230 --> 01:37:51,098
LET THE UNDERLINGS MEET, THE 

2354
01:37:51,098 --> 01:37:53,300
STATE DEPARTMENT MADE, LET THEM 

2355
01:37:53,300 --> 01:38:01,208
HAGGLE, AND HAVE THE MEETING, 

2356
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:02,075
WHICH IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A, 

2357
01:38:02,075 --> 01:38:02,977
HAVE A, AFTER A COUPLE OF 

2358
01:38:02,977 --> 01:38:07,748
DETAILS HAVE BEEN HAMMERED OUT, 

2359
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:08,382
TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE SERIOUS 

2360
01:38:08,382 --> 01:38:08,983
IN THEIR INTENTION TO 

2361
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:09,316
DENUCLEARIZE. 

2362
01:38:09,316 --> 01:38:11,418
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT.

2363
01:38:11,418 --> 01:38:13,287
>> HE DID A LITTLE BIT OF THIS 

2364
01:38:13,287 --> 01:38:17,757
BEFORE, BUT HIS OTHER INSTINCTS 

2365
01:38:17,757 --> 01:38:18,892
TOOK OVER, JUST GO TO THE 

2366
01:38:18,892 --> 01:38:19,827
MEETING, AND SAY THIS IS GOING 

2367
01:38:19,827 --> 01:38:21,562
TO BE A MEET AND GREET, WE ARE 

2368
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:22,663
NOT GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS 

2369
01:38:22,663 --> 01:38:26,000
WITH ANYTHING NEW, PEOPLE HAVE 

2370
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,834
CRITICIZED ME FOR SAYING I 

2371
01:38:26,834 --> 01:38:27,534
SHOULD MEET WITHOUT GETTING 

2372
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:28,735
SOMETHING FROM THE NORTH 

2373
01:38:28,735 --> 01:38:33,740
KOREANS, BECAUSE THE MEETING 

2374
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:35,042
ITSELF IS A CONCESSION, BUT I 

2375
01:38:35,042 --> 01:38:35,976
WANT TO GET TO KNOW HIM, I 

2376
01:38:35,976 --> 01:38:36,876
BELIEVE DIALOGUE IS IMPORTANT, 

2377
01:38:36,876 --> 01:38:37,811
A WAY TO CONDUCT DIPLOMACY. 

2378
01:38:37,811 --> 01:38:38,946
DON'T EXPECT THIS TO CHANGE THE 

2379
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:39,579
WORLD, DON'T EXPECT THE KOREAN 

2380
01:38:39,579 --> 01:38:40,981
WAR TO END, DON'T EXPECT ALL 

2381
01:38:40,981 --> 01:38:42,649
THESE BIG THINGS TO COME OUT OF 

2382
01:38:42,649 --> 01:38:44,418
IT. 

2383
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:45,419
WHAT IS REALLY STRIKING A NERVE 

2384
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:46,987
WITH ME IS HIM TRYING TO SAY 

2385
01:38:46,987 --> 01:38:50,591
HEY, OBAMA DIDN'T DO IT, I'VE 

2386
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:54,395
DONE IT, AND THIS COULD 

2387
01:38:54,395 --> 01:38:55,429
CERTAINLY BE WRONG IN A FEW 

2388
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:58,265
MINUTES, AS MORE COMES OUT, BUT 

2389
01:38:58,265 --> 01:39:05,605
IT SEEMS AT THIS POINT TO GIVE 

2390
01:39:05,605 --> 01:39:07,007
US THE EXACT SAME THING THAT WE 

2391
01:39:07,007 --> 01:39:07,540
HAVE GOTTEN IN THE PAST. 

2392
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:08,474
>> PERHAPS THERE IS AN ANNEX, 

2393
01:39:08,474 --> 01:39:09,676
WE DON'T KNOW, A POINT WE MADE 

2394
01:39:09,676 --> 01:39:10,544
EARLIER, PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT 

2395
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:11,812
PRESIDENT TRUMP THINK HE IS 

2396
01:39:11,812 --> 01:39:14,814
ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THESE THINGS 

2397
01:39:14,814 --> 01:39:16,316
THROUGH THE FORCE OF HIS WILL, 

2398
01:39:16,316 --> 01:39:17,116
BUT THE IDEA OF AN AMERICAN 

2399
01:39:17,116 --> 01:39:17,717
PRESIDENT LEADING -- MEETING 

2400
01:39:17,717 --> 01:39:18,819
WITH THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA, 

2401
01:39:18,819 --> 01:39:22,122
AS YOU POINTED OUT, AND AS BEN 

2402
01:39:22,122 --> 01:39:24,058
TRACY POINTED OUT, YOU WERE 

2403
01:39:24,058 --> 01:39:24,692
SAYING IT ALMOST HAPPENED WITH 

2404
01:39:24,692 --> 01:39:26,926
BILL CLINTON AND MADELEINE 

2405
01:39:26,926 --> 01:39:29,863
ALBRIGHT, THE HEAD OF THE STATE 

2406
01:39:29,863 --> 01:39:32,365
DEPARTMENT, THEY WERE GOING TO 

2407
01:39:32,365 --> 01:39:34,301
MEET AND HAD ALREADY MET WITH 

2408
01:39:34,301 --> 01:39:38,038
HIS FATHER, AND PRESIDENT 

2409
01:39:38,038 --> 01:39:38,672
CLINTON WAS INTENT ON MEETING 

2410
01:39:38,672 --> 01:39:51,384
WITH KIM JONG ILL -- JONG-IL, 

2411
01:39:51,384 --> 01:39:52,286
AND THEY SAID HE WAS NOT 

2412
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:53,353
SERIOUS, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS A 

2413
01:39:53,353 --> 01:39:54,520
REPEAT OF THINGS WE HAVE SEEN 

2414
01:39:54,520 --> 01:40:01,494
TIME AND TIME AGAIN, BY GIVING 

2415
01:40:01,494 --> 01:40:02,396
HIM WHAT HE WANTS, WHICH IS AN 

2416
01:40:02,396 --> 01:40:03,263
AUDIENCE WITH YOU COMES TO 

2417
01:40:03,263 --> 01:40:04,130
PRESIDENT, THAT WILL PLAY VERY 

2418
01:40:04,130 --> 01:40:05,165
WELL FOR HIM BACK HOME, AND 

2419
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:05,999
WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING FOR OUR 

2420
01:40:05,999 --> 01:40:07,201
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NORTH 

2421
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:07,501
KOREANS? 

2422
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:09,470
>> IT WILL BE FASCINATING TO 

2423
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:10,803
WATCH, IF THERE IS NO ANNEX, IF 

2424
01:40:10,803 --> 01:40:11,839
THIS IS ALL WE ARE GETTING, HOW 

2425
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:17,044
PEOPLE IN TRUMP'S ORBIT ARE 

2426
01:40:17,044 --> 01:40:18,311
GOING TO SPIN THIS, HOW THIS 

2427
01:40:18,311 --> 01:40:18,946
WILL BE SHOWN AS BEING 

2428
01:40:18,946 --> 01:40:21,080
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IS COME ON 

2429
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,616
THE PAST. 

2430
01:40:22,616 --> 01:40:23,283
AGAIN, THERE CERTAINLY COULD BE 

2431
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:24,084
DETAILS THAT I'M MISSING, OR 

2432
01:40:24,084 --> 01:40:25,619
COULD BE DIFFERENT NUANCES OF 

2433
01:40:25,619 --> 01:40:27,721
THIS, THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN, BUT 

2434
01:40:27,721 --> 01:40:30,357
AS A QUICK REACTION, COMPARED 

2435
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:31,492
TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE, 

2436
01:40:31,492 --> 01:40:34,495
COMPARED TO THE DRAMA, SUCH A 

2437
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:38,799
FRAUGHT SUMMIT, SO UNSCRIPTED, 

2438
01:40:38,799 --> 01:40:40,400
INTENSE AND INCREDIBLE MOMENTS, 

2439
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,370
TO HAVE THIS COME OUT OF IT IS 

2440
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:46,206
JUST -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO 

2441
01:40:46,206 --> 01:40:46,406
SAY. 

2442
01:40:46,406 --> 01:40:52,179
>> WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE 

2443
01:40:52,179 --> 01:40:52,846
COMPLETE DETAILS ARE, WE TALKED 

2444
01:40:52,846 --> 01:40:54,248
ABOUT ALL THE MOMENTS THAT WE 

2445
01:40:54,248 --> 01:40:56,582
WITNESS TODAY, -- WITNESSED 

2446
01:40:56,582 --> 01:40:58,118
TODAY, WE GOT A NOTE FROM BEN 

2447
01:40:58,118 --> 01:40:59,520
TRACY, HE HAS BEEN TO NORTH 

2448
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,256
KOREA MANY TIMES, AND WE DID 

2449
01:41:03,256 --> 01:41:04,158
SEE THE MOMENT WHERE WE WERE 

2450
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:04,992
WAITING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

2451
01:41:04,992 --> 01:41:06,526
CHAIRMAN KIM TO COME TO THE 

2452
01:41:06,526 --> 01:41:09,029
TABLE, AND WE SAW ONE OF THE 

2453
01:41:09,029 --> 01:41:13,133
HANDLERS, FROM THE NORTH KOREAN 

2454
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:14,234
SIDE, WIPING HIS PEN DOWN, THIS 

2455
01:41:14,234 --> 01:41:18,005
IS AN INTERESTING NOTE FROM BEN,

2456
01:41:18,005 --> 01:41:23,210
THEY WANT -- THEY BRING PENS 

2457
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:24,711
FOR HIM, THEY DON'T WANT HIS 

2458
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:30,484
FINGERPRINTS LEFT BEHIND, AND A 

2459
01:41:30,484 --> 01:41:32,486
TOILET, SO THAT NOTHING IS LEFT 

2460
01:41:32,486 --> 01:41:38,592
BEHIND. 

2461
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:39,226
THAT IS WHAT YOU GET WITH 

2462
01:41:39,226 --> 01:41:39,893
DICTATORS AND DESPOTS, THEY 

2463
01:41:39,893 --> 01:41:40,927
KNOW THAT THERE IS AN INTEREST 

2464
01:41:40,927 --> 01:41:41,929
IN THEIR FINGERPRINTS OR WHAT 

2465
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:45,866
THEY MIGHT BE -- WHAT THEIR 

2466
01:41:45,866 --> 01:41:47,234
HEALTH IS, THEY DON'T WANT 

2467
01:41:47,234 --> 01:41:47,801
PEOPLE TO KNOW, THAT IS THE 

2468
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:50,504
DEFINITION OF THIS OPAQUE AND 

2469
01:41:50,504 --> 01:41:51,104
UNKNOWABLE HERMIT KINGDOM, 

2470
01:41:51,104 --> 01:41:52,739
WHICH IS WHAT NORTH KOREA IS 

2471
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:55,041
CALLED.>> IT IS ALMOST 

2472
01:41:55,041 --> 01:41:59,413
PARADOXICAL ABOUT HOW KIM JONG-

2473
01:41:59,413 --> 01:42:00,781
UN COULD HAVE SO MUCH POWER, 

2474
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:01,514
AND BE SO PARANOID AND SO 

2475
01:42:01,514 --> 01:42:07,654
AFRAID -- AFRAID ABOUT HIS 

2476
01:42:07,654 --> 01:42:10,824
RULE, AND SAD IS MAYBE NOT THE 

2477
01:42:10,824 --> 01:42:13,526
RIGHT WORD FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

2478
01:42:13,526 --> 01:42:15,629
DONE HER AND DOES THINGS, KIND 

2479
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:16,630
OF SAD THAT YOU REACH THAT 

2480
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:19,066
POINT, AND YET YOU SPENT SO 

2481
01:42:19,066 --> 01:42:20,434
MUCH TIME FEARING FOR YOUR 

2482
01:42:20,434 --> 01:42:23,336
SAFETY.>> A REMARKABLE TURN OF 

2483
01:42:23,336 --> 01:42:29,409
EVENTS, A INTERESTING NUGGET, 

2484
01:42:29,409 --> 01:42:30,977
HE EXPECTS TO MEET HIM AGAIN, 

2485
01:42:30,977 --> 01:42:36,617
SUGGESTIONS, HE WAS ASKED ABOUT 

2486
01:42:36,617 --> 01:42:37,217
COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE, I 

2487
01:42:37,217 --> 01:42:38,084
DON'T SEE HOW THE CONGRESS 

2488
01:42:38,084 --> 01:42:39,519
WOULD ALLOW OR SUPPORT THE IDEA 

2489
01:42:39,519 --> 01:42:45,892
OF KIM COMING TO THE WHITE 

2490
01:42:45,892 --> 01:42:46,760
HOUSE, AND FRANKLY, GIVEN THIS 

2491
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:47,627
DOCUMENT, WHY WOULD HE TRAVEL 

2492
01:42:47,627 --> 01:42:49,196
SO FAR FROM THE COMFORT OF 

2493
01:42:49,196 --> 01:42:50,296
WHERE HE IS MOST COMFORTABLE, 

2494
01:42:50,296 --> 01:42:53,767
TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES, 

2495
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:55,001
GIVEN THAT HE HASN'T REALLY 

2496
01:42:55,001 --> 01:42:55,635
COMMITTED TO ANYTHING BASED ON 

2497
01:42:55,635 --> 01:42:56,536
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR? 

2498
01:42:56,536 --> 01:42:57,570
WE EXPECT TO GET MORE DETAILS 

2499
01:42:57,570 --> 01:42:59,005
OF THIS DOCUMENT, THE PRESIDENT 

2500
01:42:59,005 --> 01:43:01,541
CALLED COMPREHENSIVE, WE ARE 

2501
01:43:01,541 --> 01:43:05,345
GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK, HE 

2502
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:06,179
HAD FIRST SUGGESTED THAT HE 

2503
01:43:06,179 --> 01:43:07,047
WOULD BE HOLDING A PRESS 

2504
01:43:07,047 --> 01:43:09,883

2549
01:48:22,462 --> 01:48:25,599

01:57:50,396 --> 01:57:52,265
WE'LL SEE YOU A LITTLE BIT VERY 

2686
01:57:52,265 --> 01:57:58,404
LATER -- A LITTLE BIT LATER. 

2687
01:57:58,404 --> 01:57:59,505
I THINK OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP 

2688
01:57:59,505 --> 01:58:00,806
WITH NORTH KOREA AND THE KOREAN 

2689
01:58:00,806 --> 01:58:02,909
PENINSULA IS GOING TO BE A VERY 

2690
01:58:02,909 --> 01:58:03,843
MUCH DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN 

2691
01:58:03,843 --> 01:58:09,148
IT HAS IN THE PAST. 

2692
01:58:09,148 --> 01:58:10,649
WE BOTH WANT TO DO SOMETHING. 

2693
01:58:10,649 --> 01:58:11,850
WE BOTH ARE GOING TO DO 

2694
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:12,151
SOMETHING. 

2695
01:58:12,151 --> 01:58:13,319
AND WE'VE DEVELOPED A VERY 

2696
01:58:13,319 --> 01:58:13,953
SPECIAL BOND. 

2697
01:58:13,953 --> 01:58:17,290
SO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY 

2698
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:18,357
IMPRESSED, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 

2699
01:58:18,357 --> 01:58:23,829
BE VERY HAPPY, AND WE ARE GOING 

2700
01:58:23,829 --> 01:58:25,898
TO TAKE CARE OF A VERY BIG AND 

2701
01:58:25,898 --> 01:58:26,933
DANGEROUS PROBLEM FOR THE 

2702
01:58:26,933 --> 01:58:27,166
WORLD. 

2703
01:58:27,166 --> 01:58:28,501
AND I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN 

2704
01:58:28,501 --> 01:58:30,269
KIM, WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME 

2705
01:58:30,269 --> 01:58:31,337
TOGETHER TODAY, VERY INTENSIVE 

2706
01:58:31,337 --> 01:58:31,537
TIME. 

2707
01:58:31,537 --> 01:58:32,838
AND I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT 

2708
01:58:32,838 --> 01:58:34,439
IT WORKED OUT FOR BOTH OF US 

2709
01:58:34,439 --> 01:58:35,508
FAR BETTER THAN ANYBODY COULD 

2710
01:58:35,508 --> 01:58:36,408
HAVE EXPECTED. 

2711
01:58:36,408 --> 01:58:40,012
I THINK FAR BETTER -- I WATCHED 

2712
01:58:40,012 --> 01:58:41,280
THE VARIOUS NEWS REPORTS -- FAR 

2713
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:42,315
BETTER THAN ANYBODY EVEN 

2714
01:58:42,315 --> 01:58:42,615
PREDICTED. 

2715
01:58:42,615 --> 01:58:44,116
THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO MORE 

2716
01:58:44,116 --> 01:58:45,718

2717
01:58:45,718 --> 01:58:49,355

2749
02:00:16,175 --> 02:00:17,843

SAYS AND AS WE WERE DISCUSSING, 

2762
02:00:39,498 --> 02:00:41,033
THIS APPEARS TO BE VERY, VERY 

2763
02:00:41,033 --> 02:00:42,435
VAGUE AGREEMENT -- YOU KNOW, 

2764
02:00:42,435 --> 02:00:45,838

REALLY THERE'S NO TIMEFRAME 

2771
02:00:58,951 --> 02:00:59,184
THERE. 

2772
02:00:59,184 --> 02:01:00,252
THERE IS A DISCUSSION OF TRYING 

2773
02:01:00,252 --> 02:01:01,821
TO ACCOUNT FOR TROOPS WHO ARE 

2774
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:05,624

THE DOCUMENT ACCORDING TO YOU

02:01:56,308 --> 02:01:57,777

02:01:57,777 --> 02:01:59,111
STARTING TO LEAK OUT ON SOCIAL 

2800
02:01:59,111 --> 02:01:59,645
MEDIA INCLUDES WORD LIKE 

2801
02:01:59,645 --> 02:02:00,613

2802
02:02:00,613 --> 02:02:07,653
SOMETHING. 

2803
02:02:07,653 --> 02:02:08,921
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING AS 

2804
02:02:08,921 --> 02:02:10,456
FAR AS WE CAN TELL CONCRETE 

2805
02:02:10,456 --> 02:02:11,791
ESTABLISHED IN THAT DOCUMENT WE 

2806
02:02:11,791 --> 02:02:13,359
JUST HAD UP ON OUR SCREEN. 

2807
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:13,759
>> EXACTLY RIGHT. 

2808
02:02:13,759 --> 02:02:14,726
THIS IS SOMETHING THE NORTH HAS 

2809
02:02:14,726 --> 02:02:16,996
DONE BEFORE AND THAT IS 

2810
02:02:16,996 --> 02:02:18,531
COMMITTING TO A PROCESS IS VERY 

2811
02:02:18,531 --> 02:02:19,832
DIFFERENT THAN AN AGREEMENT ON 

2812
02:02:19,832 --> 02:02:20,199
THE SUBSTANCE. 

2813
02:02:20,199 --> 02:02:21,667
ALL IT IS IS VERY BARE-BONES -- 

2814
02:02:21,667 --> 02:02:23,202
THAT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT 

2815
02:02:23,202 --> 02:02:24,703
TWO DIPLOMATS IN A ROOM 

2816
02:02:24,703 --> 02:02:26,906
ANYWHERE COULD ESTABLISH A 

2817
02:02:26,906 --> 02:02:29,542
PROCESS. 

2818
02:02:29,542 --> 02:02:31,076
FOR THIS COMING OUT OF THE 

2819
02:02:31,076 --> 02:02:31,844
MEETING BETWEEN TWO LEADERS, 

2820
02:02:31,844 --> 02:02:36,215
LIKE THIS, IT GIVES -- RAISES A 

2821
02:02:36,215 --> 02:02:37,549
LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE 

2822
02:02:37,549 --> 02:02:39,418
PRESIDENT ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED 

2823
02:02:39,418 --> 02:02:40,385
IN A SITDOWN. 

2824
02:02:40,385 --> 02:02:41,754
THE NORTH HAS GOTTEN TO THIS 

2825
02:02:41,754 --> 02:02:42,788
POINT BEFORE AND HAS COMMITTED 

2826
02:02:42,788 --> 02:02:44,590
TO DO MANY OF THESE THINGS. 

2827
02:02:44,590 --> 02:02:45,925
SO THAT IS THE REAL QUESTION 

2828
02:02:45,925 --> 02:02:46,125
HERE. 

2829
02:02:46,125 --> 02:02:47,727
THE PRESIDENT -- WE'VE HEARD 

2830
02:02:47,727 --> 02:02:50,963
THAT FOR HIMSELF -- THE 

2831
02:02:50,963 --> 02:02:52,331
QUESTION WILL BE, HOW IS THIS 

2832
02:02:52,331 --> 02:02:53,632
DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TIMES -- 

2833
02:02:53,632 --> 02:02:56,902
WHAT ASSURANCES CAN THE 

2834
02:02:56,902 --> 02:02:57,969
PRESIDENT GIVE NOT JUST THE 

2835
02:02:57,969 --> 02:02:59,205
AMERICAN PEOPLE BUT THE PEOPLE 

2836
02:02:59,205 --> 02:03:01,140
IN THIS REGION WHO

2837
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:02,841
LIVE EVERY DAY UNDER THE THREAT 

2838
02:03:02,841 --> 02:03:05,845
OF -- NUCLEAR UMBRELLA OF THE 

2839
02:03:05,845 --> 02:03:07,813
SORT OF -- FROM NORTH KOREA 

2840
02:03:07,813 --> 02:03:09,782
THAT THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN -- 

2841
02:03:09,782 --> 02:03:13,118
THE MESSAGE, HOW IS THIS 

2842
02:03:13,118 --> 02:03:19,625
DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST -- THIS 

2843
02:03:19,625 --> 02:03:21,227
VERY THING THEY COMMITTED TO DO 

2844
02:03:21,227 --> 02:03:21,460
TODAY. 

2845
02:03:21,460 --> 02:03:23,095
>> ZEKE, I WANT TO ASK YOU, WE 

2846
02:03:23,095 --> 02:03:24,597
HAVE OVER THE COURSE OF THE 

2847
02:03:24,597 --> 02:03:26,365
LAST FIVE OR SIX HOURS HAVE SO 

2848
02:03:26,365 --> 02:03:27,399
HAVE GIVEN PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 

2849
02:03:27,399 --> 02:03:28,634
THIS HISTORIC MOMENT THAT WE 

2850
02:03:28,634 --> 02:03:29,668
WITNESSED HERE, THE PRESIDENT 

2851
02:03:29,668 --> 02:03:31,069

2852

PRESIDENT

2853
02:03:31,937 --> 02:03:33,239
MEETING WITH A NORTH KOREAN 

2854
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:36,575
LEADER TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY 

2855
02:03:36,575 --> 02:03:37,843
TO END THE HOSTILITIES THAT 

2856
02:03:37,843 --> 02:03:38,944
HAVE EXISTED BETWEEN OUR 

2857
02:03:38,944 --> 02:03:40,412
COUNTRIES FOR DECADES. 

2858
02:03:40,412 --> 02:03:41,947
ON THE OTHER HAND, I WONDER, 

2859
02:03:41,947 --> 02:03:43,449
HAVING COVERED THE G-7 SUMMIT 

2860
02:03:43,449 --> 02:03:44,750
IS WEAKENED, YOU DID, AND 

2861
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:46,552
FLYING ON TO SINGAPORE,

2862
02:03:46,552 --> 02:03:47,820
SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THE 

2863
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:49,154
PRESIDENT USED WITH REGARDS TO 

2864
02:03:49,154 --> 02:03:55,661

THERE IS THIS GENERAL SENSE THE 

2903
02:04:58,090 --> 02:04:59,124

MOST RECENTLY NOW KIM JONG-UN, 

2910
02:05:06,799 --> 02:05:10,168

LABOR CAMPS, KILLED BY SORT OF 

2913
02:05:16,141 --> 02:05:17,142
THIS BRUTAL GOVERNMENT. 

2914
02:05:17,142 --> 02:05:23,015
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE 

2915
02:05:23,015 --> 02:05:24,383
PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT 

2916
02:05:24,383 --> 02:05:24,583
FOR. 

2917
02:05:24,583 --> 02:05:25,951
WE HAVE HEARD OFFICIALS IN THE

WHATEVER IS IN THE AMERICAN 

2923
02:05:33,959 --> 02:05:34,726
INTEREST HE WILL DO. 

2924
02:05:34,726 --> 02:05:36,395
IN THIS CASE THE WAY THE WHITE 

2925
02:05:36,395 --> 02:05:37,696
HOUSE APPEARS TO BE JUSTIFYING 

2926
02:05:37,696 --> 02:05:39,298
THIS RHETORIC IS THAT IN THE 

2927
02:05:39,298 --> 02:05:40,799
HOPES OF MAYBE SECURING A 

2928
02:05:40,799 --> 02:05:42,101
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT IS OKAY FOR 

2929
02:05:42,101 --> 02:05:43,268
THE PRESIDENT TO USE THIS 

2930
02:05:43,268 --> 02:05:44,570
LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE AUTOCRATIC 

2931
02:05:44,570 --> 02:05:45,537
LEADER LIKE KIM JONG-UN.

2933
02:05:47,573 --> 02:05:48,674
THAT NEGATIVE LANGUAGE TO 

2934
02:05:48,674 --> 02:05:49,475
DESCRIBE FRIENDS AND ALLIES 

2935
02:05:49,475 --> 02:05:54,747
LIKE THE PRIME MINISTER AND

2936
02:05:54,747 --> 02:05:55,747
THE EU LEADERSHIP. 

2937
02:05:55,747 --> 02:05:57,383
THEY BELIEVE THAT'S PART OF HIS 

2938
02:05:57,383 --> 02:06:00,953
NEGOTIATING STYLE. 

2939
02:06:00,953 --> 02:06:01,920
CAN HE DELIVER ON IT? 

2940
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:07,426

HE HAS WAGERED ON THIS AND WHAT 

2944
02:06:12,865 --> 02:06:13,866
IS THE COST? 

2945
02:06:13,866 --> 02:06:21,673
USING THE RHETORIC, WE WON'T 

2946
02:06:21,673 --> 02:06:23,008

PRESIDENT CAN'T DELIVER AND 

2952
02:06:28,047 --> 02:06:29,314
USING THIS SORT OF RHETORIC 

2953
02:06:29,314 --> 02:06:30,115
DOESN'T ULTIMATELY RESULT IN 

2954
02:06:30,115 --> 02:06:30,548
THE AGREEMENT HERE. 

2955
02:06:30,548 --> 02:06:32,051

2987
02:07:27,706 --> 02:07:28,774

02:07:28,774 --> 02:07:32,111

OF EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS, THIS 

2996
02:07:48,594 --> 02:07:49,628
IS NOT EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS, 

2997
02:07:49,628 --> 02:07:50,862
THIS IS BASICALLY BARE-BONES OF 

2998
02:07:50,862 --> 02:07:52,331
WHAT A MEETING LIKE THIS COULD 

2999
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:53,398

REAFFIRMED HIS UNWAVERING 

3030
02:08:39,311 --> 02:08:39,912

THIS WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. 

3042
02:09:03,068 --> 02:09:04,336
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY 

3043
02:09:04,336 --> 02:09:05,871
REASONABLE FOR TRUMP TO GO INTO 

3044
02:09:05,871 --> 02:09:07,773
THIS AND SAY, LISTEN, WE HAD A 

3045
02:09:07,773 --> 02:09:09,341
MEETING, IT WAS GREAT THAT WE 

3046
02:09:09,341 --> 02:09:11,042
MET, WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER. 

3047
02:09:11,042 --> 02:09:13,445
NOT MUCH CAME OUT OF IT, FINE. 

3048
02:09:13,445 --> 02:09:14,980
THEN WE SEE THIS DOCUMENT AND 

3049
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:16,515
WE SEE, GREAT, A FIRST STEP, 

3050
02:09:16,515 --> 02:09:17,449
THEY MET, WE DIDN'T GET 

3051
02:09:17,449 --> 02:09:19,117
ANYTHING THAT -- WE WEREN'T 

3052
02:09:19,117 --> 02:09:19,551
EXPECTING ANYTHING. 

3053
02:09:19,551 --> 02:09:21,820
BUT YOU HAVE TRUMP SAY THIS 

3054
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:25,157
WENT BETTER THAN ANYONE COULD 

3055
02:09:25,157 --> 02:09:26,425
HAVE EXPECTED. 

3056
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:27,625
I EXPECTED IT TO GO BETTER AND 

3057
02:09:27,625 --> 02:09:28,493
IT WENT WORSE. 

3058
02:09:28,493 --> 02:09:34,967
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE FELT THE 

3059
02:09:34,967 --> 02:09:36,768
NEED TO LIE TO US ABOUT THE 

3060
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:38,303
QUALITY OF WHAT WAS GOING TO 

3061
02:09:38,303 --> 02:09:39,204
COME OUT OF THAT. 

3062
02:09:39,204 --> 02:09:40,405
JUST MEETING WOULD HAVE BEEN 

3063
02:09:40,405 --> 02:09:40,672
ENOUGH. 

3064
02:09:40,672 --> 02:09:42,240
>> WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE 

3065
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:43,508
ENTIRETY OF THE DOCUMENT, WE'VE 

3066
02:09:43,508 --> 02:09:44,709
BEEN SHOWING WHAT IS BASICALLY 

3067
02:09:44,709 --> 02:09:45,844
A SCREEN GRAB. 

3068
02:09:45,844 --> 02:09:47,145
AGAIN, TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT 

3069
02:09:47,145 --> 02:09:48,413
SORT OF THE BENEFIT, PERHAPS IN 

3070
02:09:48,413 --> 02:09:49,982
HIS MIND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 

3071
02:09:49,982 --> 02:09:51,316
IS CUMBRIAN SAID, MAYBE THIS IS 

3072
02:09:51,316 --> 02:09:52,917
SOMETHING HE WAS GOING FOR AND 

3073
02:09:52,917 --> 02:10:00,359
BECAUSE HE TENDS TO USE THAT 

3074
02:10:00,359 --> 02:10:01,894
KIND OF RHETORIC, IT IS 

3075
02:10:01,894 --> 02:10:03,195
SOMETHING WE HAVE ALL COME TO 

3076
02:10:03,195 --> 02:10:04,463
EXPECT, SUPPORTERS HAVE COME TO 

3077
02:10:04,463 --> 02:10:05,764
EXPECT, HE SAYS THINGS AND IT'S 

3078
02:10:05,764 --> 02:10:07,365
NOT EXACTLY WHAT IS IN THE 

3079
02:10:07,365 --> 02:10:08,567
LETTER OF THE LETTER OR THIS 

3080
02:10:08,567 --> 02:10:10,102
DOCUMENT BUT IN HIS MIND THIS 

3081
02:10:10,102 --> 02:10:11,269
IS SORT OF A WIN. 

3082
02:10:11,269 --> 02:10:12,738
AND HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO 

3083
02:10:12,738 --> 02:10:14,039
MEET WITH THE LEADER AND HE 

3084
02:10:14,039 --> 02:10:14,239
HAS. 

3085
02:10:14,239 --> 02:10:15,373
AND THERE'S THE DOCUMENT AND 

3086
02:10:15,373 --> 02:10:16,909
FOR HIM IT'S KIND OF A THING 

3087
02:10:16,909 --> 02:10:20,345
THAT HE IS EXPECTING A LOT OF 

3088
02:10:20,345 --> 02:10:21,613
PEOPLE WILL APPLAUD HIM FOR 

3089
02:10:21,613 --> 02:10:23,415
BECAUSE NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO 

3090
02:10:23,415 --> 02:10:24,249
GET THIS DONE BEFORE. 

3091
02:10:24,249 --> 02:10:24,783
>> TO HIM. 

3092
02:10:24,783 --> 02:10:24,983
YEAH. 

3093
02:10:24,983 --> 02:10:26,050
THAT'S -- HE HAPPENS TO BE 

3094
02:10:26,050 --> 02:10:29,421
WRONG ON THIS. 

3095
02:10:29,421 --> 02:10:31,223
LIE WAS NOT A FAIR WORD BECAUSE 

3096
02:10:31,223 --> 02:10:32,323
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS 

3097
02:10:32,323 --> 02:10:33,558
INTENTIONS WERE, BUT I HAVEN'T 

3098
02:10:33,558 --> 02:10:35,527
HAD TIME TO FULLY

3099
02:10:35,527 --> 02:10:36,361
PROCESS AND ANALYZE -- 

3100
02:10:36,361 --> 02:10:38,096
>> WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE WHOLE 

3101
02:10:38,096 --> 02:10:38,931
THING. 

3102
02:10:38,931 --> 02:10:40,899
>> WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE 

3103
02:10:40,899 --> 02:10:42,233
FROM THE SCREEN GRAB ON THE 

3104
02:10:42,233 --> 02:10:44,903
SCREEN RIGHT NOW, THAT DOCUMENT 

3105
02:10:44,903 --> 02:10:45,771
COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNED BETWEEN 

3106
02:10:45,771 --> 02:10:47,573
THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH 

3107
02:10:47,573 --> 02:10:49,107
KOREA FIVE, TEN YEARS AGO. 

3108
02:10:49,107 --> 02:10:51,276
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VIEWED AS A 

3109
02:10:51,276 --> 02:10:52,044
MODEST BREAKTHROUGH. 

3110
02:10:52,044 --> 02:10:56,281
NOW AFTER THIS MASSIVE SUMMIT, 

3111
02:10:56,281 --> 02:10:56,915
UNPRECEDENTED MEETING BETWEEN 

3112
02:10:56,915 --> 02:11:01,186
THE TWO LEADERS, THE FACT THAT 

3113
02:11:01,186 --> 02:11:03,221
WE SEEM TO BE IN THE EXACT SAME 

3114
02:11:03,221 --> 02:11:04,523
PLACE WE WERE BEFORE ALL OF 

3115
02:11:04,523 --> 02:11:06,091
THIS I THINK IS PRETTY 

3116
02:11:06,091 --> 02:11:07,059
DISAPPOINTING. 

3117
02:11:07,059 --> 02:11:09,261
>> THIS WILL BE VIEWED THROUGH 

3118
02:11:09,261 --> 02:11:10,796
THE PRISM OF POLITICS IN THIS 

3119
02:11:10,796 --> 02:11:12,798
COUNTRY AS IT ALWAYS IS. 

3120
02:11:12,798 --> 02:11:14,333
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 

3121
02:11:14,333 --> 02:11:15,600
SUPPORTERS OF THE PRESIDENT AND 

3122
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:16,868
MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY WILL LOOK 

3123
02:11:16,868 --> 02:11:18,170
TO THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET FROM 

3124
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:18,836
BEFORE THE MEETING HAPPENED 

3125
02:11:18,836 --> 02:11:20,304
WHERE HE CALLED THE LOSERS AND 

3126
02:11:20,304 --> 02:11:24,076
HATERS, THOSE THAT DON'T WANT 

3127
02:11:24,076 --> 02:11:25,343
TO SEE HIM SUCCEED ESSENTIALLY. 

3128
02:11:25,343 --> 02:11:29,648
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE 

3129
02:11:29,648 --> 02:11:30,949
HAS BEEN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH 

3130
02:11:30,949 --> 02:11:32,250
AND BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO 

3131
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:34,485
CRITICAL OF HIM AND HIS 

3132
02:11:34,485 --> 02:11:35,454
ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY ARE 

3133
02:11:35,454 --> 02:11:36,554
GOING TO CRITICIZE THIS NO 

3134
02:11:36,554 --> 02:11:37,422
MATTER THE RESULT. 

3135
02:11:37,422 --> 02:11:38,389
ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE 

3136
02:11:38,389 --> 02:11:40,158
SOME INCLUDING CONSERVATIVES 

3137
02:11:40,158 --> 02:11:41,359
WHO HAVE ALWAYS CAUTIONED 

3138
02:11:41,359 --> 02:11:44,062
AGAINST MEETING WITH NORTH 

3139
02:11:44,062 --> 02:11:45,163
KOREA, WITHOUT ANYTHING SIGNED 

3140
02:11:45,163 --> 02:11:53,271
BEFORE THE ACTUAL MEETING. 

3141
02:11:53,271 --> 02:11:54,406
LET THE UNDERLINGS MEET, LET 

3142
02:11:54,406 --> 02:11:55,473
THE STATE DEPARTMENT, DIPLOMATS 

3143
02:11:55,473 --> 02:11:56,541
HAGGLE, SOME OF THE DETAILS, 

3144
02:11:56,541 --> 02:11:58,477
AND HAVE THIS MEETING WHICH IF 

3145
02:11:58,477 --> 02:12:00,278
YOU WANT TO HAVE IT, HAVE IT 

3146
02:12:00,278 --> 02:12:01,813
AFTER A COUPLE OF DETAILS WHERE 

3147
02:12:01,813 --> 02:12:04,883
YOU CAN SHOW TO THE WORLD THAT 

3148
02:12:04,883 --> 02:12:06,417
NORTH KOREA IS SERIOUS WITH ITS 

3149
02:12:06,417 --> 02:12:14,192
INTENTIONS TO DENUCLEARIZE. 

3150
02:12:14,192 --> 02:12:15,160
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT. 

3151
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:16,561
ANOTHER THING IS GOING TO THE 

3152
02:12:16,561 --> 02:12:18,330
MEETING AND HE DID A LITTLE BIT 

3153
02:12:18,330 --> 02:12:19,698
OF THIS BEFORE, BUT HIS OTHER 

3154
02:12:19,698 --> 02:12:21,666
INSTINCTS TOOK OVER, SAY, IT IS 

3155
02:12:21,666 --> 02:12:23,201
GOING TO BE MEET AND GREET, 

3156
02:12:23,201 --> 02:12:24,535
WE'RE NOT GOING TO COME OUT 

3157
02:12:24,535 --> 02:12:25,370
WITH ANYTHING NEW. 

3158
02:12:25,370 --> 02:12:26,537
I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED 

3159
02:12:26,537 --> 02:12:27,839
ME FOR SAYING I SHOULDN'T MEET 

3160
02:12:27,839 --> 02:12:28,907
WITHOUT GETTING SOMETHING FROM 

3161
02:12:28,907 --> 02:12:30,175
THE NORTH KOREANS BECAUSE THE 

3162
02:12:30,175 --> 02:12:31,443
MEETING ITSELF IS A CONCESSION. 

3163
02:12:31,443 --> 02:12:33,145
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW KIM JONG-

3164
02:12:33,145 --> 02:12:34,312
UN, DIALOGUE IS IMPORTANT, THIS 

3165
02:12:34,312 --> 02:12:35,446
IS A WAY TO CONDUCT DIPLOMACY. 

3166
02:12:35,446 --> 02:12:38,750
DON'T EXPECT THIS TO CHANGE THE 

3167
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:40,018
WORLD, DON'T EXPECT ALL OF 

3168
02:12:40,018 --> 02:12:41,920
THESE BIG THINGS TO COME OUT OF 

3169
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:42,086
IT. 

3170
02:12:42,086 --> 02:12:43,655
WHAT IS STRIKING A NERVE WITH 

3171
02:12:43,655 --> 02:12:56,301
ME IS HIM TRYING TO SAY, HEY, 

3172
02:12:56,301 --> 02:12:57,869
OBAMA DIDN'T DO IT, BUSH DIDN'T 

3173
02:12:57,869 --> 02:12:59,070
DO IT, I'VE DONE IT. 

3174
02:12:59,070 --> 02:13:00,172
AND THEN SEEMING AT THIS POINT 

3175
02:13:00,172 --> 02:13:02,240
-- THIS COULD BE WRONG IN A FEW 

3176
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:03,775
MINUTES OR AS MORE COMES OUT -- 

3177
02:13:03,775 --> 02:13:09,381
SEEMING TO GIVE US THE EXACT 

3178
02:13:09,381 --> 02:13:10,949
SAME THING WE'VE GOTTEN IN THE 

3179
02:13:10,949 --> 02:13:11,149
PAST. 

3180
02:13:11,149 --> 02:13:12,217
>> ZEKE POINTED OUT PERHAPS 

3181
02:13:12,217 --> 02:13:13,752
THERE'S AN ANNEX, BUT IT DOES 

3182
02:13:13,752 --> 02:13:15,287
SEEM, IT'S A POINT WE MADE 

3183
02:13:15,287 --> 02:13:16,321
EARLIER, PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT 

3184
02:13:16,321 --> 02:13:17,622
PRESIDENT TRUMP THINK HE'S ABLE 

3185
02:13:17,622 --> 02:13:18,623
TO ACCOMPLISH THINGS THROUGH 

3186
02:13:18,623 --> 02:13:19,524
THE FORCE OF WILL. 

3187
02:13:19,524 --> 02:13:21,226
THE REALITY IS THE IDEA OF AN 

3188
02:13:21,226 --> 02:13:22,027
AMERICAN PRESIDENT MEETING WITH 

3189
02:13:22,027 --> 02:13:23,295
A LEADER OF NORTH KOREA AS YOU 

3190
02:13:23,295 --> 02:13:24,462
POINTED OUT AND AS BEN TRACY 

3191
02:13:24,462 --> 02:13:25,864
POINTED OUT, IT -- YOU ARE 

3192
02:13:25,864 --> 02:13:27,165
SAYING IT ALMOST HAPPENED WITH 

3193
02:13:27,165 --> 02:13:28,366
BILL CLINTON AND MADELINE 

3194
02:13:28,366 --> 02:13:29,034
ALBRIGHT. 

3195
02:13:29,034 --> 02:13:30,869
AT THE TIME THE HEAD OF THE 

3196
02:13:30,869 --> 02:13:31,302
STATE DEPARTMENT. 

3197
02:13:31,302 --> 02:13:32,470
YOU KNOW, WAS GOING TO -- HAD 

3198
02:13:32,470 --> 02:13:36,508
ALREADY MET WITH JIM AND KIM'S 

3199
02:13:36,508 --> 02:13:36,741
FATHER. 

3200
02:13:36,741 --> 02:13:37,542
AND PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS 

3201
02:13:37,542 --> 02:13:40,245
INTENT ON MEETING WITH KIM JONG-

3202
02:13:40,245 --> 02:13:40,712
IL, HIS FATHER. 

3203
02:13:40,712 --> 02:13:44,983
AND IT NEVER HAPPENED BECAUSE 

3204
02:13:44,983 --> 02:13:46,117
PEOPLE SAID, LOOK, YOU KNOW, 

3205
02:13:46,117 --> 02:13:47,018
HE'S NOT SERIOUS. 

3206
02:13:47,018 --> 02:13:48,186
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS 

3207
02:13:48,186 --> 02:13:49,721
PROBABLY GOING TO BE A REPEAT 

3208
02:13:49,721 --> 02:13:51,523
OF THINGS WE'VE SEEN TIME AND 

3209
02:13:51,523 --> 02:13:51,823
TIME AGAIN. 

3210
02:13:51,823 --> 02:13:53,792
BY GIVING HIM WHAT HE WANTS 

3211
02:13:53,792 --> 02:14:00,799
WHICH IS AN AUDIENCE WITH YOU, 

3212
02:14:00,799 --> 02:14:02,067
MR. PRESIDENT, THAT WILL PLAY 

3213
02:14:02,067 --> 02:14:03,602
WELL FOR HIM BACK HOME, WON'T 

3214
02:14:03,602 --> 02:14:04,402
CHANGE ANYTHING FOR OUR 

3215
02:14:04,402 --> 02:14:05,470
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NORTH 

3216
02:14:05,470 --> 02:14:06,138
KOREANS. 

3217
02:14:06,138 --> 02:14:07,005
>> FASCINATING TO WATCH IF 

3218
02:14:07,005 --> 02:14:08,840
THERE IS NO ANNEX, IF THIS IS 

3219
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:11,877
ALL THAT WE ARE GETTING, HOW 

3220
02:14:11,877 --> 02:14:13,145
PEOPLE IN TRUMP'S ORBIT ARE 

3221
02:14:13,145 --> 02:14:14,913
GOING TO SPIN THIS, HOW THIS IS 

3222
02:14:14,913 --> 02:14:16,013
GOING TO BE EXPLAINED, SHOWN AS 

3223
02:14:16,013 --> 02:14:20,986
BEING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAS 

3224
02:14:20,986 --> 02:14:22,153
COME OUT IN THE PAST. 

3225
02:14:22,153 --> 02:14:22,821
AGAIN THERE'S CERTAINLY -- 

3226
02:14:22,821 --> 02:14:24,589
COULD BE A LOT OF DETAILS THAT 

3227
02:14:24,589 --> 02:14:25,690
I AM MISSING OR COULD BE 

3228
02:14:25,690 --> 02:14:26,691
DIFFERENT NUANCES THAT I 

3229
02:14:26,691 --> 02:14:28,360
HAVEN'T SEEN, BUT AS A QUICK 

3230
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:32,197
REACTION, COMPARED TO WHERE WE 

3231
02:14:32,197 --> 02:14:33,498
WERE BEFORE, COMPARED TO ALL 

3232
02:14:33,498 --> 02:14:34,799
THE DRAMA, SUCH A FRAUGHT 

3233
02:14:34,799 --> 02:14:37,969
SUMMIT, SUCH -- SO MANY REALLY 

3234
02:14:37,969 --> 02:14:39,538
TENSE AND INCREDIBLE MOMENTS, 

3235
02:14:39,538 --> 02:14:41,840
AND TO HAVE THIS COME OUT OF IT 

3236
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:43,975
IS JUST

3237
02:14:43,975 --> 02:14:45,777
-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. 

3238
02:14:45,777 --> 02:14:47,345
>> AS WE WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE 

3239
02:14:47,345 --> 02:14:49,814
DETAILS OF THIS DOCUMENT ARE, 

3240
02:14:49,814 --> 02:14:51,383
WE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THE 

3241
02:14:51,383 --> 02:14:52,384
MOMENTS WE WITNESSED TODAY AND 

3242
02:14:52,384 --> 02:14:55,287
WE GOT A NOTE FROM BEN TRACY 

3243
02:14:55,287 --> 02:14:56,655
WHO IS OUR CBS NEWS 

3244
02:14:56,655 --> 02:14:58,190
CORRESPONDENT, HE HAS BEEN TO 

3245
02:14:58,190 --> 02:14:59,891
NORTH KOREA MANY TIMES, WE DID 

3246
02:14:59,891 --> 02:15:02,127
SEE THAT MOMENT WHERE WE WERE 

3247
02:15:02,127 --> 02:15:06,665
WAITING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

3248
02:15:06,665 --> 02:15:08,466
CHAIRMAN KIM TO COME TO THE 

3249
02:15:08,466 --> 02:15:09,501
TABLE AND WE WITNESSED -- WE 

3250
02:15:09,501 --> 02:15:11,036
SAW ONE OF THE HANDLERS, ONE OF 

3251
02:15:11,036 --> 02:15:12,304
HIS HANDLERS FROM THE NORTH 

3252
02:15:12,304 --> 02:15:13,872
KOREAN SIDE WIPING HIS PEN 

3253
02:15:13,872 --> 02:15:15,373
DOWN. 

3254
02:15:15,373 --> 02:15:16,942
THIS IS AN INTERESTING NOTE FOR 

3255
02:15:16,942 --> 02:15:18,243
BEN OR FROM BEN, THEY BRING 

3256
02:15:18,243 --> 02:15:19,110
PENS EVERYWHERE, THEY DON'T 

3257
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:21,513
WANT HIS FINGERPRINTS

3258
02:15:21,513 --> 02:15:22,480
LEFT ON ANYTHING. 

3259
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:23,615
THEY ALSO REPORTEDLY ACCORDING 

3260
02:15:23,615 --> 02:15:28,153
TO BEN BURN THE TOILET, SO, NO 

3261
02:15:28,153 --> 02:15:29,454
INFO CAN BE GLEANED. 

3262
02:15:29,454 --> 02:15:29,754
SERIOUSLY. 

3263
02:15:29,754 --> 02:15:30,689
IT IS INTERESTING, THAT'S WHAT 

3264
02:15:30,689 --> 02:15:32,923
YOU GET WITH DICTATORS AND 

3265
02:15:32,923 --> 02:15:36,027
DESPOTS. 

3266
02:15:36,027 --> 02:15:37,295
THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S AN 

3267
02:15:37,295 --> 02:15:38,529
INTEREST IN THEIR FINGERPRINTS 

3268
02:15:38,529 --> 02:15:47,505
OR WHAT THEY MAY BE -- WHAT 

3269
02:15:47,505 --> 02:15:49,074
THEIR HEALTH IS AND THEY DON'T 

3270
02:15:49,074 --> 02:15:49,974
WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW. 

3271
02:15:49,974 --> 02:15:51,276
THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF THIS 

3272
02:15:51,276 --> 02:15:52,343
OPAQUE AND UNKNOWABLE -- HERMIT 

3273
02:15:52,343 --> 02:15:54,412
KINGDOM. 

3274
02:15:54,412 --> 02:15:54,879
>> CERTAINLY. 

3275
02:15:54,879 --> 02:15:55,513
ALMOST PERFECT -- PARADOXICAL 

3276
02:15:55,513 --> 02:15:56,748
HOW SOMEONE LIKE KIM JONG-UN 

3277
02:15:56,748 --> 02:16:01,686
SOUP -- COULD HAVE SO MUCH 

3278
02:16:01,686 --> 02:16:03,488
POWER AND BE SO PARANOID AND SO 

3279
02:16:03,488 --> 02:16:05,056
AFRAID FOR HIS OWN LIFE AND 

3280
02:16:05,056 --> 02:16:05,289
SAFETY. 

3281
02:16:05,289 --> 02:16:09,194
IT'S KIND OF SAD THAT PEOPLE 

3282
02:16:09,194 --> 02:16:10,729
WHO REACH THE PINNACLE AND WHO 

3283
02:16:10,729 --> 02:16:12,230
ARE DICTATORS, MAYBE SAD IS NOT 

3284
02:16:12,230 --> 02:16:13,765
THE RIGHT WORD FOR PEOPLE WHO 

3285
02:16:13,765 --> 02:16:14,566
HAVE DONE HORRENDOUS THINGS -- 

3286
02:16:14,566 --> 02:16:16,201
I THINK IT IS KIND OF SAD THAT 

3287
02:16:16,201 --> 02:16:25,777
YOU REACH THAT POINT AND YET 

3288
02:16:25,777 --> 02:16:26,911
YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME FEARING 

3289
02:16:26,911 --> 02:16:27,745
FOR YOUR SAFETY. 

3290
02:16:27,745 --> 02:16:28,045
>> RIGHT. 

3291
02:16:28,045 --> 02:16:29,681
IT IS SUCH A REMARKABLE TURN OF 

3292
02:16:29,681 --> 02:16:31,016
EVENTS AND SUCH AN INTERESTING 

3293
02:16:31,016 --> 02:16:31,249
NUGGET. 

3294
02:16:31,249 --> 02:16:32,017
THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE EXPECT 

3295
02:16:32,017 --> 02:16:33,050
TO MEET CHAIRMAN KIM AGAIN, 

3296
02:16:33,050 --> 02:16:34,318
SUGGESTIONS THAT HE WAS ASKED 

3297
02:16:34,318 --> 02:16:35,620
WHETHER HE WOULD COME TO THE 

3298
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:36,655
WHITE HOUSE, GIVEN THIS 

3299
02:16:36,655 --> 02:16:37,987
DOCUMENT I DON'T SEE HOW THE 

3300
02:16:37,987 --> 02:16:39,056
CONGRESS WOULD ALLOW -- NOT 

3301
02:16:39,056 --> 02:16:40,291
ALLOW BUT SUPPORT THE IDEA OF 

3302
02:16:40,291 --> 02:16:41,825
KIM COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE 

3303
02:16:41,825 --> 02:16:43,395
AND GIVEN THIS DOCUMENT, I 

3304
02:16:43,395 --> 02:16:45,763
DON'T THINK HE WOULD DO IT, WHY 

3305
02:16:45,763 --> 02:16:47,098
WOULD HE TRAVEL SO FAR FROM THE 

3306
02:16:47,098 --> 02:16:48,566
COMFORTS OF WHERE HE IS MOST 

3307
02:16:48,566 --> 02:16:49,668
COMFORTABLE TO COME TO THE 

3308
02:16:49,668 --> 02:16:50,535
UNITED STATES? 

3309
02:16:50,535 --> 02:16:52,771
GIVEN THAT HE ISN'T COMMITTED 

3310
02:16:52,771 --> 02:16:54,138
TO ANYTHING BASED ON WHAT WE'VE 

3311
02:16:54,138 --> 02:16:54,772
SEEN SO FAR? 

3312
02:17:02,245 --> 02:17:03,514

QUESTIONS, HOPEFULLY TAKE 

3324
02:17:24,769 --> 02:17:25,804
SEVERAL QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT'S 

3325
02:17:25,804 --> 02:17:27,339
BEEN QUITE SOME TIME SINCE THE 

3326
02:17:27,339 --> 02:17:28,306
PRESIDENT HAS HELD A FORMAL 

3327
02:17:28,306 --> 02:17:28,940
CONFERENCE.

KYLIE, GREAT TO SEE YOU. 

3338
02:17:42,654 --> 02:17:52,129
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT 

3339
02:17:52,129 --> 02:17:53,130
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED 

3340
02:17:53,130 --> 02:17:54,165
COMPREHENSIVE BUT ISAAC STONE 

3341
02:17:54,165 --> 02:17:55,700
FISH, ONE OF OUR EXPERTS, SAID 

3342
02:17:55,700 --> 02:18:02,673
WAS SORT OF DISAPPOINTING. 

3343
02:18:02,673 --> 02:18:03,708
HELP YOUR AUDIENCE UNDERSTAND 

3344
02:18:03,708 --> 02:18:04,976
THE CONTEXT OF THIS DOCUMENT, 

3345
02:18:04,976 --> 02:18:06,010
THIS JOINT STATEMENT BETWEEN 

3346
02:18:06,010 --> 02:18:07,011
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CHAIRMAN 

3347
02:18:07,011 --> 02:18:08,413
KIM JONG-UN THAT WE SAW SIGNS 

3348
02:18:08,413 --> 02:18:09,214
AN HOUR AGO. 

3349
02:18:09,214 --> 02:18:10,647
>> Reporter: I THINK THE BOTTOM 

3350
02:18:10,647 --> 02:18:11,683
LINE HERE IS THAT PRESIDENT 

3351
02:18:11,683 --> 02:18:13,183
TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN DID SIGN 

3352
02:18:13,183 --> 02:18:13,484
SOMETHING. 

3353
02:18:13,484 --> 02:18:15,452
AND THAT IS AN AGREEMENT TO 

3354
02:18:15,452 --> 02:18:18,590
CONTINUE TALKS, TO CONTINUE 

3355
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:20,191
WORKING ON WHAT IS THE U.S. 

3356
02:18:20,191 --> 02:18:28,199
GOAL, THE GOAL OVER AND OVER 

3357
02:18:28,199 --> 02:18:29,334
AGAIN -- OF DENUCLEARIZATION OF 

3358
02:18:29,334 --> 02:18:30,234
THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 

3359
02:18:30,234 --> 02:18:31,335
THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT IF 

3360
02:18:31,335 --> 02:18:32,702
TRUMP WAS GOING TO WALK OUT OF 

3361
02:18:32,702 --> 02:18:33,571
THIS MEETING TODAY. 

3362
02:18:33,571 --> 02:18:34,839
HOW HE WAS GOING TO GET ALONG 

3363
02:18:34,839 --> 02:18:36,307
WITH KIM JONG-UN. 

3364
02:18:36,307 --> 02:18:37,642
OBVIOUSLY THEY HAD DECENT 

3365
02:18:37,642 --> 02:18:37,941
CHEMISTRY. 

3366
02:18:37,941 --> 02:18:39,177
THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT OF THE 

3367
02:18:39,177 --> 02:18:40,978
MEETINGS AND HE SAID THEY HAD A 

3368
02:18:40,978 --> 02:18:46,049
SPECIAL BOND. 

3369
02:18:46,049 --> 02:18:47,317
HE DESCRIBED KIM JONG-UN AS 

3370
02:18:47,317 --> 02:18:48,620
SOMEONE WHO WAS TALENTED AND 

3371
02:18:48,620 --> 02:18:49,587
SOMEONE WHO LOVES HIS COUNTRY. 

3372
02:18:49,587 --> 02:18:51,222
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS ONE OF THE 

3373
02:18:51,222 --> 02:18:53,424
WORST DICTATORS IN THE WORLD 

3374
02:18:53,424 --> 02:18:54,925
THAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. 

3375
02:18:54,925 --> 02:18:56,895
WHAT IT DEMONSTRATES IS THAT 

3376
02:18:56,895 --> 02:18:58,129
THE PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO 

3377
02:18:58,129 --> 02:18:58,829
CONTINUE WORKING WITH KIM JONG-

3378
02:18:58,829 --> 02:19:01,833
UN TO ACHIEVE THE LONG-STANDING 

3379
02:19:01,833 --> 02:19:02,901
GOAL OF DENUCLEARIZATION. 

3380
02:19:02,901 --> 02:19:13,311
THIS DOCUMENT ISN'T LAYING OUT 

3381
02:19:13,311 --> 02:19:14,846
THE SPECIFICS OF HOW THEY ARE 

3382
02:19:14,846 --> 02:19:16,214
GOING TO GET THERE JUST YET. 

3383
02:19:16,214 --> 02:19:17,915
>> IN FACT AS YOU POINT OUT, 

3384
02:19:17,915 --> 02:19:19,450
IT'S NOT SPECIFIC, IT IS VERY 

3385
02:19:19,450 --> 02:19:20,584
VAGUE AND THERE ARE FOUR BULLET 

3386
02:19:20,584 --> 02:19:21,753
POINTS HERE THAT ACCORDING TO 

3387
02:19:21,753 --> 02:19:23,021
THE EXPERTS WE HAVE SPOKEN TO 

3388
02:19:23,021 --> 02:19:24,322
-- I KNOW THAT GIVEN YOUR 

3389
02:19:24,322 --> 02:19:25,623
COVERAGE AS THE STATE 

3390
02:19:25,623 --> 02:19:26,357
DEPARTMENT REPORTER YOU SEE 

3391
02:19:26,357 --> 02:19:27,691
THIS AS WELL THAT THESE ARE 

3392
02:19:27,691 --> 02:19:29,193
THINGS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS 

3393
02:19:29,193 --> 02:19:31,029
HAVE AGREED TO IN THE PAST WITH 

3394
02:19:31,029 --> 02:19:31,629
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS AND 

3395
02:19:31,629 --> 02:19:32,496
HAVE YET TO FOLLOW UP. 

3396
02:19:32,496 --> 02:19:33,496
>> Reporter: RIGHT. 

3397
02:19:33,496 --> 02:19:34,331
IT'S INTERESTING, EXACTLY 25 

3398
02:19:34,331 --> 02:19:38,870
YEARS AGO TODAY, THE CLINTON 

3399
02:19:38,870 --> 02:19:39,937
ADMINISTRATION AGREED TO A 

3400
02:19:39,937 --> 02:19:51,082
SIMILAR OBJECTIVE WITH NORTH 

3401
02:19:51,082 --> 02:19:52,617
KOREA, THEY WERE IN NEW YORK 

3402
02:19:52,617 --> 02:19:53,885
MEETING AND THEY BOTH -- BOTH 

3403
02:19:53,885 --> 02:19:55,186
AGREED TO DENUCLEARIZATION OF 

3404
02:19:55,186 --> 02:19:56,488
THE KOREAN PENINSULA SO YOU ARE 

3405
02:19:56,488 --> 02:19:57,555
RIGHT, THIS HAS HAPPENED 

3406
02:19:57,555 --> 02:19:57,788
BEFORE. 

3407
02:19:57,788 --> 02:19:58,590
CRITICS WILL SAY THEY HAVEN'T 

3408
02:19:58,590 --> 02:19:59,858
SET ANY CONCRETE PLANS ABOUT 

3409
02:19:59,858 --> 02:20:00,758
HOW TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. 

3410
02:20:00,758 --> 02:20:01,826
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BREAK 

3411
02:20:01,826 --> 02:20:04,128
DOWN NORTH KOREA'S EXTENSIVE 

3412
02:20:04,128 --> 02:20:04,528
NUCLEAR PROGRAM? 

3413
02:20:04,528 --> 02:20:05,462
THAT HAS SHOWN THAT IT IS 

3414
02:20:05,462 --> 02:20:09,367
REALLY SUCCEEDED SCIENTIFICALLY 

3415
02:20:09,367 --> 02:20:10,935
AND EXPONENTIALLY SO OVER THE 

3416
02:20:10,935 --> 02:20:11,235
LAST YEAR? 

3417
02:20:11,235 --> 02:20:14,172
RIGHT? 

3418
02:20:14,172 --> 02:20:15,206
I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE 

3419
02:20:15,206 --> 02:20:16,774
-- I WAS SITTING EARLIER TODAY 

3420
02:20:16,774 --> 02:20:19,477
WITH ONE OF OUR CONTRIBUTORS, 

3421
02:20:19,477 --> 02:20:21,012
BOB CARLIN, AND HE HAS WORKED 

3422
02:20:21,012 --> 02:20:24,516
AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, HE HAS 

3423
02:20:24,516 --> 02:20:25,817
WORKED AT THE CIA COVERING 

3424
02:20:25,817 --> 02:20:26,217
NORTH KOREA. 

3425
02:20:26,217 --> 02:20:27,318
IN BOTH OF THOSE INSTANCES. 

3426
02:20:27,318 --> 02:20:28,753
HE SAID HE WAITED MORE THAN 40 

3427
02:20:28,753 --> 02:20:30,321
YEARS TO JUST SEE THE PRESIDENT 

3428
02:20:30,321 --> 02:20:31,623
OF THE UNITED STATES SHAKE 

3429
02:20:31,623 --> 02:20:34,726
HANDS WITH KIM JONG-UN. 

3430
02:20:34,726 --> 02:20:35,727
WE SHOULDN'T DEMEAN THE 

3431
02:20:35,727 --> 02:20:37,328
HISTORIC NATURE OF WHAT WE SAW 

3432
02:20:37,328 --> 02:20:40,431
TODAY. 

3433
02:20:40,431 --> 02:20:41,966
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF HOW 

3434
02:20:41,966 --> 02:20:43,568
THEY ARE GOING TO GO FORTH FROM 

3435
02:20:43,568 --> 02:20:43,768
HERE. 

3436
02:20:43,768 --> 02:20:44,135
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

3437
02:20:44,135 --> 02:20:45,336
THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT, 

3438
02:20:45,336 --> 02:20:47,138
BECAUSE HE IS DESCRIBED AS A 

3439
02:20:47,138 --> 02:20:52,577
CHANGE AGENT, A DISRUPTOR, HE 

3440
02:20:52,577 --> 02:20:54,112
HAS SAID THAT HAVING BEEN AN 

3441
02:20:54,112 --> 02:20:55,680
OUTSIDER, SOMEONE NOT PART OF 

3442
02:20:55,680 --> 02:21:01,519
THE SWAMP, NOT PART OF THE 

3443
02:21:01,519 --> 02:21:02,287
WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT AND 

3444
02:21:02,287 --> 02:21:03,821
THE STATUS QUO WAS WILLING TO 

3445
02:21:03,821 --> 02:21:05,089
DO SOMETHING NO OTHER SITTING 

3446
02:21:05,089 --> 02:21:06,624
PRESIDENT HAS DONE WHICH IS TO 

3447
02:21:06,624 --> 02:21:08,092
MEET WITH THE NORTH KOREAN 

3448
02:21:08,092 --> 02:21:08,359
DICTATOR. 

3449
02:21:08,359 --> 02:21:09,494
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT 

3450
02:21:09,494 --> 02:21:10,894
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. 

3451
02:21:10,894 --> 02:21:12,130
TO AT LEAST BE GIVEN -- BEGIN 

3452
02:21:12,130 --> 02:21:12,530
THIS PROCESS. 

3453
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:13,264
THE QUESTION WILL BE, DOES THIS 

3454
02:21:13,264 --> 02:21:18,303
<font color="#0000FF"><u>ND WITH DENUCLEARIZATION? </u></font>

3455
02:21:18,303 --> 02:21:19,337
THE PRESIDENT, AFTER BAND -- 

3456
02:21:19,337 --> 02:21:20,605
BANDYING ABOUT THE IDEA HE 

3457
02:21:20,605 --> 02:21:21,906
MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR A NOBEL 

3458
02:21:21,906 --> 02:21:30,181
PEACE PRIZE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY TO 

3459
02:21:30,181 --> 02:21:31,449
THAT WALK BACK EXPECTATIONS AND 

3460
02:21:31,449 --> 02:21:32,750
SUGGESTED THIS WAS GOING TO 

3461
02:21:32,750 --> 02:21:34,152
TAKE MANY MONTHS PERHAPS MANY 

3462
02:21:34,152 --> 02:21:34,385
YEARS. 

3463
02:21:34,385 --> 02:21:35,853
ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT WE DID 

3464
02:21:35,853 --> 02:21:36,888
HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT DURING 

3465
02:21:36,888 --> 02:21:38,189
THE SIGNING OF THIS DOCUMENT 

3466
02:21:38,189 --> 02:21:39,556
WAS THAT IT WAS COMPREHENSIVE. 

3467
02:21:39,556 --> 02:21:40,792
AND THAT IT WAS GOING TO AFFECT 

3468
02:21:40,792 --> 02:21:42,327
MAJOR CHANGE AND THAT I THINK 

3469
02:21:42,327 --> 02:21:43,895
FR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

3470
02:21:43,895 --> 02:21:44,896
STUDIED THE NORTH KOREAN 

3471
02:21:44,896 --> 02:21:45,964
PROBLEM FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, 

3472
02:21:45,964 --> 02:21:47,532
THIS IS A HISTORIC MOMENT AND 

3473
02:21:47,532 --> 02:21:48,566
PRESIDENT TRUMP DESERVES CREDIT 

3474
02:21:48,566 --> 02:21:49,834
FOR UNDERTAKING IT BUT AT THE 

3475
02:21:49,834 --> 02:21:51,769
END OF THE DAY, WILL WE SEE 

3476
02:21:51,769 --> 02:21:53,338
MORE OF THE SAME FROM THE NORTH 

3477
02:21:53,338 --> 02:21:54,438
KOREANS OR WILL THIS ACTUALLY 

3478
02:21:54,438 --> 02:21:55,906
LEAD TO POSITIVE AND LASTING 

3479
02:21:55,906 --> 02:21:56,307
CHANGE? 

3480
02:21:56,307 --> 02:21:59,343
>> Reporter: RIGHT. 

3481
02:21:59,343 --> 02:22:03,915
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS I SPOKE 

3482
02:22:03,915 --> 02:22:05,015
WITH SOME NUCLEAR EXPERTS IN 

3483
02:22:05,015 --> 02:22:07,151
WASHINGTON THIS WEEK WHO 

3484
02:22:07,151 --> 02:22:08,286
VISITED WITH WHITE HOUSE 

3485
02:22:08,286 --> 02:22:10,054
OFFICIALS AHEAD OF THE SUMMIT, 

3486
02:22:10,054 --> 02:22:11,556
AND THEY WERE WORRIED THAT THE 

3487
02:22:11,556 --> 02:22:14,125
WHITE HOUSE WOULD GET OUT TOO 

3488
02:22:14,125 --> 02:22:15,660
FAR AHEAD OF THEMSELVES IN THIS 

3489
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:18,563
SUMMIT, COMMIT TO THINGS THEY 

3490
02:22:18,563 --> 02:22:19,897
SHOULDN'T BE COMMITTING TO, TOO 

3491
02:22:19,897 --> 02:22:20,230
EARLY ON. 

3492
02:22:20,230 --> 02:22:21,466
FOR EXAMPLE THEY SAID THERE WAS 

3493
02:22:21,466 --> 02:22:23,334
A NEED TO BALANCE SPEED AND 

3494
02:22:23,334 --> 02:22:23,567
SAFETY. 

3495
02:22:23,567 --> 02:22:27,305
THEY GAVE THAT ADVICE TO THE 

3496
02:22:27,305 --> 02:22:28,339
WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY 

3497
02:22:28,339 --> 02:22:29,407
IF THERE'S AN EXTENSIVE NUCLEAR 

3498
02:22:29,407 --> 02:22:31,309
PROGRAM, THAT TAKES EXPERTS TO 

3499
02:22:31,309 --> 02:22:32,010
BREAK DOWN. 

3500
02:22:32,010 --> 02:22:34,545
SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE PEOPLE 

3501
02:22:34,545 --> 02:22:36,547
WHO ARE GOING TO SAY THE WHITE 

3502
02:22:36,547 --> 02:22:38,583
HOUSE IS GOING FOURTH HERE IN A 

3503
02:22:38,583 --> 02:22:44,322
WAY THAT HAS POTENTIAL TO BE A 

3504
02:22:44,322 --> 02:22:45,623
LITTLE BIT MORE MEASURED THAN 

3505
02:22:45,623 --> 02:22:46,824
SOME EXPERTS WERE WORRIED 

3506
02:22:46,824 --> 02:22:47,057
ABOUT. 

3507
02:22:47,057 --> 02:22:47,791
HEADING INTO THIS MEETING.

WHILE WE AWAIT REMARKS BY THE

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 

3517
02:23:05,710 --> 02:23:07,378
YOU ARE LOOKING AT A LIVE 

3518
02:23:07,378 --> 02:23:08,680
PICTURE WHERE WE EXPECT THE 

3519
02:23:08,680 --> 02:23:09,514
PRESIDENT WILL TAKE QUESTIONS. 

3520
02:23:09,514 --> 02:23:10,014

PRESIDENT TRUMP AND NORTH 

3526
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:56,707
KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN. 

3527
02:26:56,707 --> 02:26:59,610
WE ARE WAITING FOR THE PRESIDENT

3528
02:26:59,610 --> 02:27:01,612
TO MAKE SOME REMARKS AND TAKE 

3529
02:27:01,612 --> 02:27:08,819
SOME QUESTIONS. 

3530
02:27:08,819 --> 02:27:10,554
IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR OR SO. 

3531
02:27:10,554 --> 02:27:12,456
WE ARE GOING TO BRING THAT TO

02:27:12,456 --> 02:27:12,823
YOU LIVE. 

3533
02:27:12,823 --> 02:27:14,058
THIS DOCUMENT THAT WAS SIGNED 

3534
02:27:14,058 --> 02:27:15,393
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM 

3535
02:27:15,393 --> 02:27:16,460
JONG-UN SAYS NORTH KOREA IS 

3536
02:27:16,460 --> 02:27:17,562
COMMITTED TO THE COMPLETE 

3537
02:27:17,562 --> 02:27:18,596
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 

3538
02:27:18,596 --> 02:27:19,397
PENINSULA BUT IT'S UNCLEAR 

3539
02:27:19,397 --> 02:27:21,265
EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS OR WHAT 

3540
02:27:21,265 --> 02:27:22,165
THE PROCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE. 

3541
02:27:22,165 --> 02:27:23,668
NORTH KOREA IS BELIEVED TO HAVE 

3542
02:27:23,668 --> 02:27:24,769
100 SITES THAT COULD DEVELOP 

3543
02:27:24,769 --> 02:27:25,202
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

3544
02:27:25,202 --> 02:27:26,203
EARLIER ELAINE QUIJANO SPOKE 

3545
02:27:26,203 --> 02:27:32,476
WITH DARRELL KIMBALL, EXECUTIVE 

3546
02:27:32,476 --> 02:27:33,844
DIRECTOR OF THE ARMS CONTROL 

3547
02:27:33,844 --> 02:27:34,177
ASSOCIATION. 

3548
02:27:34,177 --> 02:27:35,680
>> WHAT WOULD IT MEAN FOR THE 

3549
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:36,514
PENINSULA TO COMPLETELY AND 

3550
02:27:36,514 --> 02:27:37,081
IRREVERSIBLY DENUCLEARIZE? 

3551
02:27:37,081 --> 02:27:38,115
>> THIS WOULD BE A MAJOR 

3552
02:27:38,115 --> 02:27:39,784
UNDERTAKING BECAUSE NORTH KOREA 

3553
02:27:39,784 --> 02:27:42,619
HAS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL NUCLEAR 

3554
02:27:42,619 --> 02:27:43,421
WEAPONS INFRASTRUCTURE, THEY 

3555
02:27:43,421 --> 02:27:46,290
HAVE HUNDREDS OF BUILDINGS, 

3556
02:27:46,290 --> 02:27:47,791
THEY'VE GOT DOZENS OF 

3557
02:27:47,791 --> 02:27:51,562
FACILITIES, THEY HAVE SOME TEN 

3558
02:27:51,562 --> 02:27:52,562
TO 16 NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

3559
02:27:52,562 --> 02:27:53,965
THEY HAVE ELASTIC MISSILES THAT 

3560
02:27:53,965 --> 02:27:57,768
CAN DELIVER THOSE NUCLEAR 

3561
02:27:57,768 --> 02:27:59,337
WEAPONS, THEY HAVE RESEARCH 

3562
02:27:59,337 --> 02:28:00,004
FACILITIES, TESTING FACILITIES, 

3563
02:28:00,004 --> 02:28:03,474
SO THIS IS A MAJOR UNDERTAKING 

3564
02:28:03,474 --> 02:28:04,942
THAT IS GOING TO TAKE SEVERAL 

3565
02:28:04,942 --> 02:28:08,512
YEARS AT BEST. 

3566
02:28:08,512 --> 02:28:09,981
THIS SUMMIT COULD BE A START AT 

3567
02:28:09,981 --> 02:28:10,381
THAT PROCESS. 

3568
02:28:10,381 --> 02:28:11,248
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT NORTH 

3569
02:28:11,248 --> 02:28:14,352
KOREA HAS REACHED AGREEMENT 

3570
02:28:14,352 --> 02:28:15,753
WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER 

3571
02:28:15,753 --> 02:28:19,957
COUNTRIES TO DENUCLEARIZE IN 

3572
02:28:19,957 --> 02:28:20,324
THE PAST. 

3573
02:28:20,324 --> 02:28:22,059
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE 

3574
02:28:22,059 --> 02:28:22,927
ARE HEARING THIS TERM 

3575
02:28:22,927 --> 02:28:23,327
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

3576
02:28:23,327 --> 02:28:24,795
IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO 

3577
02:28:24,795 --> 02:28:28,065
1992 WHEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA 

3578
02:28:28,065 --> 02:28:32,803
FIRST REACHED AGREEMENT ON A 

3579
02:28:32,803 --> 02:28:35,006
KOREAN PENINSULA 

3580
02:28:35,006 --> 02:28:35,673
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

3581
02:28:35,673 --> 02:28:37,575
SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO 

3582
02:28:37,575 --> 02:28:40,344
HERE IS TRYING TO CLARIFY, 

3583
02:28:40,344 --> 02:28:41,545
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT IS, TRYING 

3584
02:28:41,545 --> 02:28:42,446
TO CLARIFY, WHAT 

3585
02:28:42,446 --> 02:28:43,848
DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS, TO MAKE 

3586
02:28:43,848 --> 02:28:54,125
SURE THE U.S. AND NORTH KOREA 

3587
02:28:54,125 --> 02:28:55,726
HAVE THE SAME DEFINITION, THE 

3588
02:28:55,726 --> 02:28:56,794
SAME UNDERSTANDING OF THE STEPS 

3589
02:28:56,794 --> 02:28:58,129
NECESSARY AND THE SEQUENCE AND 

3590
02:28:58,129 --> 02:28:59,663
TIMING OF THOSE STEPS AND HOW 

3591
02:28:59,663 --> 02:29:01,665
WE ARE GOING TO VERIFY THIS 

3592
02:29:01,665 --> 02:29:02,065
COMPLEX PROCESS. 

3593
02:29:02,065 --> 02:29:03,467
>> YOU SAY THAT THE PROCESS 

3594
02:29:03,467 --> 02:29:04,869
ITSELF WOULD TAKE SEVERAL YEARS 

3595
02:29:04,869 --> 02:29:05,202
AT BEST. 

3596
02:29:05,202 --> 02:29:06,337
WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE? 

3597
02:29:06,337 --> 02:29:07,904
>> I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT 

3598
02:29:07,904 --> 02:29:08,805
THIS IN PHASES. 

3599
02:29:08,805 --> 02:29:12,777
AS YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING, 

3600
02:29:12,777 --> 02:29:14,378
NORTH KOREA HAS TAKEN A COUPLE 

3601
02:29:14,378 --> 02:29:15,179
OF IMPORTANT CONFIDENCE 

3602
02:29:15,179 --> 02:29:16,080
BUILDING STEPS, THEY HAVE 

3603
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:17,048
PLEDGED TO STOP BALLISTIC 

3604
02:29:17,048 --> 02:29:18,182
MISSILE FLIGHT TESTING, THEY 

3605
02:29:18,182 --> 02:29:22,720
HAVE BLOWN UP THE ENTRANCES TO 

3606
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:24,021
THE TUNNELS AT THEIR NUCLEAR 

3607
02:29:24,021 --> 02:29:25,422
TEST SITE AND SAID THEY ARE 

3608
02:29:25,422 --> 02:29:26,690
GOING TO STOP NUCLEAR TESTING, 

3609
02:29:26,690 --> 02:29:28,292
THEY HAVE CONDUCTED SIX 

3610
02:29:28,292 --> 02:29:29,259
EXPLOSIONS IN THE PAST. 

3611
02:29:29,259 --> 02:29:30,628
THAT'S A GOOD STEP FORWARD. 

3612
02:29:30,628 --> 02:29:35,032
BUT THEY CONTINUE TO PRODUCE 

3613
02:29:35,032 --> 02:29:36,133
MATERIAL THAT'S HIGHLY ENRICHED 

3614
02:29:36,133 --> 02:29:39,437
URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM THAT YOU 

3615
02:29:39,437 --> 02:29:41,038
USE AS THE CORE MATERIAL FOR 

3616
02:29:41,038 --> 02:29:41,438
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

3617
02:29:41,438 --> 02:29:45,276
THE FIRST STEP IS TO SOLIDIFY 

3618
02:29:45,276 --> 02:29:46,177
THE MISSILE FLIGHT TESTING 

3619
02:29:46,177 --> 02:29:47,077
FREEZE, THE NUCLEAR TEST 

3620
02:29:47,077 --> 02:29:54,652
STOPPAGE, AND NEED TO SEE THE 

3621
02:29:54,652 --> 02:29:55,719
NORTH KOREANS STOP PRODUCTION 

3622
02:29:55,719 --> 02:29:56,787
OF ENRICHED URANIUM AND 

3623
02:29:56,787 --> 02:29:57,087
PLUTONIUM. 

3624
02:29:57,087 --> 02:29:57,888
THAT WILL PROVIDE FOR TIME, THE 

3625
02:29:57,888 --> 02:29:59,022
TIME NECESSARY TO BEGIN THE 

3626
02:29:59,022 --> 02:30:01,992
COMPLEX PROCESS OF DISMANTLING 

3627
02:30:01,992 --> 02:30:03,060
AND DISABLING THE NUCLEAR INFO 

3628
02:30:03,060 --> 02:30:05,196
STRUCTURE AND IDENTIFYING WHERE 

3629
02:30:05,196 --> 02:30:08,399
THE SITES ARE, BEGINNING TO 

3630
02:30:08,399 --> 02:30:09,967
REMOVE THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN A 

3631
02:30:09,967 --> 02:30:11,836
SAFE MANNER. 

3632
02:30:11,836 --> 02:30:13,103
WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT 

3633
02:30:13,103 --> 02:30:15,973
THE NORTH KOREANS SEE 

3634
02:30:15,973 --> 02:30:23,247
DENUCLEARIZATION AS A PROCESS OF

3635
02:30:23,247 --> 02:30:24,715
-- THAT INVOLVES ACTION FOR 

3636
02:30:24,715 --> 02:30:25,115
ACTION STEPS. 

3637
02:30:25,115 --> 02:30:26,584
THE NORTH KOREANS ARE NOT GOING 

3638
02:30:26,584 --> 02:30:27,918
TO MOVE ALONG DOWN THE ROAD 

3639
02:30:27,918 --> 02:30:28,318
TOWARDS COMPLETE 

3640
02:30:28,318 --> 02:30:29,420
DENUCLEARIZATION UNLESS THEY 

3641
02:30:29,420 --> 02:30:31,355
RECEIVE ASSURANCES THAT THEIR 

3642
02:30:31,355 --> 02:30:35,893
REGIME WILL REMAIN INTACT. 

3643
02:30:35,893 --> 02:30:36,960
THEY NEED SECURITY GUARANTEES, 

3644
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:39,163
THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE AND BE 

3645
02:30:39,163 --> 02:30:40,564
SAFE AND SECURE WITHOUT THEIR 

3646
02:30:40,564 --> 02:30:46,270
ARSENAL. 

3647
02:30:46,270 --> 02:30:48,139
SO THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 

3648
02:30:48,139 --> 02:30:50,007
ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT'S GOING TO 

3649
02:30:50,007 --> 02:30:51,342
HAPPEN IN A STEPWISE FASHION, 

3650
02:30:51,342 --> 02:30:52,443
ACTION FOR ACTION, STEPS. 

3651
02:30:52,443 --> 02:30:53,277
THE OTHER QUESTION OF COURSE 

3652
02:30:53,277 --> 02:30:54,645
IS, HOW QUICKLY THIS TAKES 

3653
02:30:54,645 --> 02:30:55,312
PLACE. 

3654
02:30:55,312 --> 02:30:56,881
I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE ARE 

3655
02:30:56,881 --> 02:30:58,215
GOING TO SEE IS A 

3656
02:30:58,215 --> 02:31:03,053
SOLIDIFICATION OF THE NUCLEAR 

3657
02:31:03,053 --> 02:31:04,388
TESTING AND BALLISTIC MISSILE 

3658
02:31:04,388 --> 02:31:05,222
TEST FREEZE, A STOPPAGE OF 

3659
02:31:05,222 --> 02:31:06,089
MATERIAL PRODUCTION IN THE 

3660
02:31:06,089 --> 02:31:08,626
FIRST FEW MONTHS, MAYBE BY NEXT 

3661
02:31:08,626 --> 02:31:09,826
YEAR, IF WE ARE LUCKY. 

3662
02:31:09,826 --> 02:31:13,664
GET INTO THE PROCESS OF 

3663
02:31:13,664 --> 02:31:14,398
VISITING SITES, IDENTIFYING 

3664
02:31:14,398 --> 02:31:15,900
WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE, SO 

3665
02:31:15,900 --> 02:31:19,837
THE PROCESS OF DISMANTLEMENT 

3666
02:31:19,837 --> 02:31:20,737
AND DESTRUCTION CAN BEGIN. 

3667
02:31:20,737 --> 02:31:24,742
>> GIVEN THOSE STEPS, HOW 

3668
02:31:24,742 --> 02:31:26,510
LIKELY IS IT THAT THE U.S. AND 

3669
02:31:26,510 --> 02:31:27,778
NORTH KOREA HAVE DIFFERENT 

3670
02:31:27,778 --> 02:31:28,879
DEFINITIONS OF 

3671
02:31:28,879 --> 02:31:29,279
DENUCLEARIZATION? 

3672
02:31:29,279 --> 02:31:30,781
>> UP TO THIS POINT, THEY HAVE 

3673
02:31:30,781 --> 02:31:33,817
HAD DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS AND 

3674
02:31:33,817 --> 02:31:35,251
THIS HAS BEEN A MAJOR STICKING 

3675
02:31:35,251 --> 02:31:36,086
POINT ACCORDING TO PRESS 

3676
02:31:36,086 --> 02:31:37,087
REPORTS OUT OF SINGAPORE. 

3677
02:31:37,087 --> 02:31:38,255
IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO 

3678
02:31:38,255 --> 02:31:41,725
TOMORROW'S OR I SHOULD SAY 

3679
02:31:41,725 --> 02:31:43,093
TONIGHT'S MEETING. 

3680
02:31:43,093 --> 02:31:47,665
SO FROM THE U.S. PERSPECTIVE, 

3681
02:31:47,665 --> 02:31:52,469
DENUCLEARIZATION INVOLVES A 

3682
02:31:52,469 --> 02:31:54,004
COMPLETE REMOVAL OF ALL NUCLEAR 

3683
02:31:54,004 --> 02:31:54,638
WEAPONS, THE DISMANTLEMENT OF 

3684
02:31:54,638 --> 02:31:55,806
THE FACILITIES, THE NUCLEAR 

3685
02:31:55,806 --> 02:32:01,145
MATERIAL, OVER A PERIOD OF 

3686
02:32:01,145 --> 02:32:01,345
TIME. 

3687
02:32:01,345 --> 02:32:01,946
THE NORTH KOREANS SEE 

3688
02:32:01,946 --> 02:32:02,913
DENUCLEARIZATION AS THE REMOVAL 

3689
02:32:02,913 --> 02:32:09,186
OF U.S. STRATEGIC ASSETS FROM 

3690
02:32:09,186 --> 02:32:10,087
THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 

3691
02:32:10,087 --> 02:32:11,422
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE REMOVAL 

3692
02:32:11,422 --> 02:32:12,456
OF ANY U.S. MILITARY FORCES 

3693
02:32:12,456 --> 02:32:19,063
THAT CAN CARRY NUCLEAR WEAPONS 

3694
02:32:19,063 --> 02:32:20,598
OR THAT CAN STRIKE NORTH KOREA 

3695
02:32:20,598 --> 02:32:22,132
AND HIT REGIME TARGETS IN A 

3696
02:32:22,132 --> 02:32:22,632
DECAPITATION STRIKE FOR 

3697
02:32:22,632 --> 02:32:22,899
INSTANCE. 

3698
02:32:22,899 --> 02:32:24,268
THAT MEANS NO B-1 BOMBERS, NO 

3699
02:32:24,268 --> 02:32:25,201
NUCLEAR POWERED AIRCRAFT 

3700
02:32:25,201 --> 02:32:31,942
CARRIERS, SHOULD BE IN THE 

3701
02:32:31,942 --> 02:32:33,510
REGION OR SHOULD BE PART OF 

3702
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:34,044
JOINT U.S./SOUTH KOREAN 

3703
02:32:34,044 --> 02:32:34,978
MILITARY EXERCISES. 

3704
02:32:34,978 --> 02:32:36,280
THAT'S HOW THE NORTH KOREANS 

3705
02:32:36,280 --> 02:32:37,815
DEFINE IT AND THAT'S A STEP THE 

3706
02:32:37,815 --> 02:32:39,617
UNITED STATES CAN TAKE BECAUSE 

3707
02:32:39,617 --> 02:32:41,018
HAVING THOSE ASSETS IN THE 

3708
02:32:41,018 --> 02:32:42,719
REGION IS NOT NECESSARY TO 

3709
02:32:42,719 --> 02:32:46,790
PROTECT SOUTH KOREA IN CASE 

3710
02:32:46,790 --> 02:32:48,492
THERE IS A CONFLICT AT SOME 

3711
02:32:48,492 --> 02:32:49,927
POINT IN TIME. 

3712
02:32:49,927 --> 02:32:51,962
>> WHAT ABOUT THE FINANCIAL 

3713
02:32:51,962 --> 02:32:53,697
IMPACT, IS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT A 

3714
02:32:53,697 --> 02:32:54,999
NUMBER ON HOW MUCH IT WOULD 

3715
02:32:54,999 --> 02:32:56,367
COST THE REGIME TO DENUCLEARIZE 

3716
02:32:56,367 --> 02:32:57,967
I -- AND WHO WOULD FOOT THE 

3717
02:32:57,967 --> 02:32:59,069
BILL FOR THAT? 

3718
02:32:59,069 --> 02:33:00,437
>> THAT'S A CRUCIAL QUESTION. 

3719
02:33:00,437 --> 02:33:02,640
I DOUBT THAT THE NORTH KOREANS 

3720
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:10,514
ARE GOING TO BE AS -- ASKED TO 

3721
02:33:10,514 --> 02:33:12,049
FOOT THE BILL BECAUSE IF YOU 

3722
02:33:12,049 --> 02:33:13,584
THINK ABOUT THE STEPS THAT I 

3723
02:33:13,584 --> 02:33:14,852
WAS DESCRIBING, THIS IS AN 

3724
02:33:14,852 --> 02:33:15,819
OPERATION THAT WILL TAKE YEARS. 

3725
02:33:15,819 --> 02:33:16,453
SOME LARGE INDUSTRIAL 

3726
02:33:16,453 --> 02:33:18,055
FACILITIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 

3727
02:33:18,055 --> 02:33:19,323
BE TAKEN DOWN, REACTORS ARE 

3728
02:33:19,323 --> 02:33:21,058
GOING TO HAVE TO BE 

3729
02:33:21,058 --> 02:33:21,425
DECOMMISSIONED. 

3730
02:33:21,425 --> 02:33:27,064
WE ARE TALKING BILLIONS OF 

3731
02:33:27,064 --> 02:33:28,332
DOLLARS WHETHER IT GETS INTO 

3732
02:33:28,332 --> 02:33:29,433
THE TENS OF BILLIONS OF 

3733
02:33:29,433 --> 02:33:30,300
DOLLARS, NOT CLEAR. 

3734
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:31,468
BUT WHAT PROBABLY WOULD HAPPEN 

3735
02:33:31,468 --> 02:33:33,003
IF WE GET THAT FAR IS THAT 

3736
02:33:33,003 --> 02:33:35,472
SOUTH KOREA, UNITED STATES, 

3737
02:33:35,472 --> 02:33:36,540
PERHAPS CHINA, PERHAPS RUSSIA, 

3738
02:33:36,540 --> 02:33:37,741
OTHER COUNTRIES MIGHT ASSIST IN 

3739
02:33:37,741 --> 02:33:41,478
FOOTING THE BILL INVOLVED IN 

3740
02:33:41,478 --> 02:33:42,479
UNDERTAKING THESE OPERATIONS. 

3741
02:33:42,479 --> 02:33:44,147
BUT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE DONE 

3742
02:33:44,147 --> 02:33:45,949
WITH THE COOPERATION OF NORTH 

3743
02:33:45,949 --> 02:33:47,484
KOREAN ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS 

3744
02:33:47,484 --> 02:33:48,885
WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THESE 

3745
02:33:48,885 --> 02:33:56,593
SITES, THEY KNOW HOW THE 

3746
02:33:56,593 --> 02:33:57,627
WEAPONS WERE BUILT FOR 

3747
02:33:57,627 --> 02:33:58,929
INSTANCE, SO THERE'S GOING TO 

3748
02:33:58,929 --> 02:34:00,130
HAVE TO BE A COOPERATIVE 

3749
02:34:00,130 --> 02:34:00,931
úPROGR 

3750
02:34:00,931 --> 02:34:01,698
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT 

3751
02:34:01,698 --> 02:34:02,532
HELPS UNDERTAKE THESE 

3752
02:34:02,532 --> 02:34:02,832
ACTIVITIES. 

3753
02:34:02,832 --> 02:34:03,433
THERE'S ALSO THE COST OF THE 

3754
02:34:03,433 --> 02:34:04,501
VERIFICATION AND OVERSIGHT PART 

3755
02:34:04,501 --> 02:34:06,904
OF THIS PROCESS. 

3756
02:34:06,904 --> 02:34:12,843
SO IF WE GET A DECLARATION FROM 

3757
02:34:12,843 --> 02:34:13,810
NORTH KOREA, OF WHERE THEIR 

3758
02:34:13,810 --> 02:34:15,179
SITES ARE, WHAT THEIR WEAPONS 

3759
02:34:15,179 --> 02:34:17,648
HOLDINGS ARE, HOW LARGE THEIR 

3760
02:34:17,648 --> 02:34:22,086
STOCKPILES ARE, THAT WILL ALLOW 

3761
02:34:22,086 --> 02:34:22,853
INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY 

3762
02:34:22,853 --> 02:34:24,722
AGENCY INSPECTORS TO COME IN, 

3763
02:34:24,722 --> 02:34:29,126
TO VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF THAT 

3764
02:34:29,126 --> 02:34:30,260
DECLARATION, THAT WILL COST 

3765
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:32,930
MONEY, THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC 

3766
02:34:32,930 --> 02:34:36,400
ENERGY AGENCY IS FINANCED BY 

3767
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:37,167
MANY DIFFERENT NATIONS 

3768
02:34:37,167 --> 02:34:39,036
INCLUDING THE U.S., THEY HAVE 

3769
02:34:39,036 --> 02:34:40,304
AN EXISTING BUDGET THAT CAN 

3770
02:34:40,304 --> 02:34:42,206
COVER THE COST BUT TO DO THIS 

3771
02:34:42,206 --> 02:34:43,673
OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS, THE 

3772
02:34:43,673 --> 02:34:46,176
IAEA WILL NEED EXTRA TENS OF 

3773
02:34:46,176 --> 02:34:48,645
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR 

3774
02:34:48,645 --> 02:34:50,113
TO UNDERTAKE THESE OPERATIONS. 

3775
02:34:50,113 --> 02:34:52,149
THE COMPREHENSIVE TREATY 

3776
02:34:52,149 --> 02:34:53,483
ORGANIZATION ALSO WILL HAVE A 

3777
02:34:53,483 --> 02:34:55,653
ROLE IN CONFIRMING THE SHUTDOWN 

3778
02:34:55,653 --> 02:34:57,888
OF THE NORTH KOREAN TEST SITE, 

3779
02:34:57,888 --> 02:35:02,225
AND MONITORING FOR NUCLEAR TEST 

3780
02:35:02,225 --> 02:35:05,262
EXPLOSIONS THAT WOULD VIOLATE 

3781
02:35:05,262 --> 02:35:06,162
NORTH KOREA'S PLEDGES. 

3782
02:35:06,162 --> 02:35:07,497
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE COSTS. 

3783
02:35:07,497 --> 02:35:16,940
HOW THE BILL IS PAID, THAT'S AN 

3784
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:18,475
ISSUE FOR FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD 

3785
02:35:18,475 --> 02:35:19,743
BUT THERE ARE PRECEDENTS FOR 

3786
02:35:19,743 --> 02:35:21,278
DOING THAT, IN THE PAST WITH 

3787
02:35:21,278 --> 02:35:22,445
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA 

3788
02:35:22,445 --> 02:35:23,514
AND THEY ARE DISARMAMENT 

3789
02:35:23,514 --> 02:35:23,781
PROCESS. 

3790
02:35:23,781 --> 02:35:25,215
>> A LOT OF OPEN QUESTIONS, 

3791
02:35:25,215 --> 02:35:26,083
DARRELL CAMPBELL, THANKS FOR 

3792
02:35:26,083 --> 02:35:26,850
YOUR INSIGHT. 

3793
02:35:26,850 --> 02:35:27,451
>> THANK YOU. 

3794
02:35:27,451 --> 02:35:28,351
>>> ALL RIGHT. 

3795
02:35:28,351 --> 02:35:30,020
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

3796
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:31,288
BREAK WHILE WE AWAIT REMARKS BY 

3797
02:35:31,288 --> 02:35:32,722
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

3798
02:35:32,722 --> 02:35:34,224
STATES. 

3799
02:35:34,224 --> 02:35:34,924
STAY WITH US. 

3800
02:35:34,924 --> 02:35:35,425
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 

3801
02:35:35,425 --> 02:35:35,692
CBS NEWS. 

3802
02:35:35,692 --> 02:35:35,993
ALWAYS ON. 

3803
02:39:18,982 --> 02:39:23,620
>>> NORTH KOREA BEST NOT MAKE 

3804
02:39:23,620 --> 02:39:25,188
ANY MORE THREATS TO THE UNITED 

3805
02:39:25,188 --> 02:39:25,856
STATES. 

3806
02:39:25,856 --> 02:39:27,290
THEY WILL BE MET WITH FIRE AND 

3807
02:39:27,290 --> 02:39:32,963
FURY LIKE THE WORLD HAS NEVER 

3808
02:39:32,963 --> 02:39:33,630
SEEN. 

3809
02:39:33,630 --> 02:39:35,732
>> ROCKET MAN IS ON A SUICIDE 

3810
02:39:35,732 --> 02:39:36,566
MISSION FOR HIMSELF. 

3811
02:39:36,566 --> 02:39:39,202
>> HE REALLY HAS BEEN VERY OPEN 

3812
02:39:39,202 --> 02:39:44,675
AND -- I THINK VERY HONORABLE 

3813
02:39:44,675 --> 02:39:45,842
FROM EVERYTHING WE ARE SEEING. 

3814
02:39:45,842 --> 02:39:48,178
>> IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE 

3815
02:39:48,178 --> 02:39:49,212
EXISTING SUMMIT COULD TAKE 

3816
02:39:49,212 --> 02:39:51,214
PLACE OR A SUMMIT AT SOME LATER 

3817
02:39:51,214 --> 02:39:52,649
DATE. 

3818
02:39:52,649 --> 02:39:55,752
>> THIS WAS A MEETING WHERE A 

3819
02:39:55,752 --> 02:39:59,122
LETTER WAS GIVEN TO ME BY KIM 

3820
02:39:59,122 --> 02:40:05,595
JONG-UN AND THAT LETTER WAS A 

3821
02:40:05,595 --> 02:40:06,462
VERY NICE LETTER. 

3822
02:40:06,462 --> 02:40:08,098
>> IF YOU INVITE HIM TO THE 

3823
02:40:08,098 --> 02:40:09,366
WHITE HOUSE OR THE UNITED 

3824
02:40:09,366 --> 02:40:10,901
STATES WOULDN'T BE HERE AT THE 

3825
02:40:10,901 --> 02:40:12,235
WHITE HOUSE OR AT MAR-A-LAGO? 

3826
02:40:12,235 --> 02:40:13,537
>> MAYBE WE'LL START WITH THE 

3827
02:40:13,537 --> 02:40:13,937
WHITE HOUSE. 

3828
02:40:13,937 --> 02:40:14,938
>> I FEEL CONFIDENT, I FEEL 

3829
02:40:14,938 --> 02:40:16,172
THAT KIM JONG-UN WANTS TO DO 

3830
02:40:16,172 --> 02:40:17,874
SOMETHING GREAT FOR HIS PEOPLE. 

3831
02:40:17,874 --> 02:40:20,844
AND HE HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY. 

3832
02:40:20,844 --> 02:40:22,379
AND HE WON'T HAVE THAT 

3833
02:40:22,379 --> 02:40:26,283
OPPORTUNITY AGAIN. 

3834
02:40:26,283 --> 02:40:27,851
>> I FEEL REALLY GREAT, WITH 

3835
02:40:27,851 --> 02:40:28,618
THE GREAT DISCUSSION, 

3836
02:40:28,618 --> 02:40:29,386
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS, 

3837
02:40:29,386 --> 02:40:29,919
TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL. 

3838
02:40:29,919 --> 02:40:36,460
IT'S MY HONOR AND YOU WILL HAVE 

3839
02:40:36,460 --> 02:40:37,761
A TERRIFIC RELATIONSHIP, I HAVE 

3840
02:40:37,761 --> 02:40:38,161
NO DOUBT. 

3841
02:40:38,161 --> 02:40:39,763
>> I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY IT 

3842
02:40:39,763 --> 02:40:42,432
WORKED OUT FOR BOTH OF US FAR 

3843
02:40:42,432 --> 02:40:43,734
BETTER THAN ANYBODY COULD HAVE 

3844
02:40:43,734 --> 02:40:44,001
EXPECTED. 

3845
02:40:44,001 --> 02:40:45,235
I THINK FOR BETTER -- I WATCHED 

3846
02:40:45,235 --> 02:40:46,536
THE VARIOUS NEWS REPORTS, FAR 

3847
02:40:46,536 --> 02:40:47,571
BETTER THAN ANYBODY EVEN 

3848
02:40:47,571 --> 02:40:47,871
PREDICTED. 

3849
02:40:47,871 --> 02:40:49,139
THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO MORE 

3850
02:40:49,139 --> 02:40:51,975
AND MORE AND MORE -- IT'S AN 

3851
02:40:51,975 --> 02:40:55,479
HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. 

3852
02:40:55,479 --> 02:40:57,013
VERY GREAT HONOR, THANK YOU TO 

3853
02:40:57,013 --> 02:40:58,315
ALL OF YOUR REPRESENTATIVES, 

3854
02:40:58,315 --> 02:41:00,851
VERY MUCH. 

3855
02:41:00,851 --> 02:41:01,751
>> ALL RIGHT. 

3856
02:41:01,751 --> 02:41:03,153
YOU SAW THE GREATEST HITS OF 

3857
02:41:03,153 --> 02:41:03,954
THE PRESIDENT, STARTING WITH 

3858
02:41:03,954 --> 02:41:09,359
AUGUST OF 2017 WHERE HE 

3859
02:41:09,359 --> 02:41:10,193
THREATENED NORTH KOREA 

3860
02:41:10,193 --> 02:41:10,894
ESSENTIALLY WITH NUCLEAR 

3861
02:41:10,894 --> 02:41:11,895
ANNIHILATION, TO THE POINT 

3862
02:41:11,895 --> 02:41:13,296
WHERE WE ARE TODAY WHERE THE 

3863
02:41:13,296 --> 02:41:14,831
PRESIDENT IS SITTING DOWN IN A 

3864
02:41:14,831 --> 02:41:16,099
HISTORIC MEETING WITH THE NORTH 

3865
02:41:16,099 --> 02:41:16,933
KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG-UN, 

3866
02:41:16,933 --> 02:41:18,735
SAYING TO A RESPONSE TO A 

3867
02:41:18,735 --> 02:41:20,670
QUESTION ABOUT

3868
02:41:20,670 --> 02:41:21,938
WHETHER THE NORTH KOREANS WOULD 

3869
02:41:21,938 --> 02:41:22,705
BE DENUCLEARIZING SAYING THAT 

3870
02:41:22,705 --> 02:41:29,946
HE EXPECTS THE PROCESS WILL 

3871
02:41:29,946 --> 02:41:30,981
START VERY QUICKLY, VERY 

3872
02:41:30,981 --> 02:41:31,748
QUICKLY ABSOLUTELY, THE 

3873
02:41:31,748 --> 02:41:32,749
PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG-UN 

3874
02:41:32,749 --> 02:41:33,784
SIGNING WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

3875
02:41:33,784 --> 02:41:35,085
CALLED A TOM BRANT OF DOCUMENT, 

3876
02:41:35,085 --> 02:41:35,985
JOINT STATEMENT BETWEEN HIMSELF 

3877
02:41:35,985 --> 02:41:36,852
AND CHAIRMAN CHIEF -- CHAIRMAN 

3878
02:41:36,852 --> 02:41:37,053
KIM. 

3879
02:41:37,053 --> 02:41:38,121
IN THAT DOCUMENT, IT APPEARS 

3880
02:41:38,121 --> 02:41:42,559
THAT IT IS SIMILAR TO LANGUAGE 

3881
02:41:42,559 --> 02:41:45,429
USED BEFORE BY THE NORTH KOREANS

3882
02:41:45,429 --> 02:41:46,863
IN PROMISES THEY HAVE MADE TO 

3883
02:41:46,863 --> 02:41:47,730
THE UNITED STATES. 

3884
02:41:47,730 --> 02:41:49,099
THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING SET TO 

3885
02:41:49,099 --> 02:41:50,600
ADDRESS THIS DOCUMENT AND THE 

3886
02:41:50,600 --> 02:41:56,406
HISTORIC MEETING TO REPORTERS 

3887
02:41:56,406 --> 02:41:57,740
IN SINGAPORE, LOOKING AT A LIVE 

3888
02:41:57,740 --> 02:41:59,009
PICTURE RIGHT NOW OF THE 

3889
02:41:59,009 --> 02:42:00,277
BRIEFING ROOM WHERE THAT IS 

3890
02:42:00,277 --> 02:42:02,178
GOING TO HAPPEN AND OF COURSE 

3891
02:42:02,178 --> 02:42:03,713
THE PODIUM WITH THE GREAT SEAL, 

3892
02:42:03,713 --> 02:42:05,248
ON THAT PODIUM WHERE WE EXPECT 

3893
02:42:05,248 --> 02:42:06,750
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE TAKING 

3894
02:42:06,750 --> 02:42:07,617
QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS VERY 

3895
02:42:07,617 --> 02:42:09,186
SOON. 

3896
02:42:09,186 --> 02:42:10,720
WHILE WE AWAIT, LET'S BRING IN 

3897
02:42:10,720 --> 02:42:11,755
ISAAC STONE FISH, CBSN 

3898
02:42:11,755 --> 02:42:12,756
CONTRIBUTOR AND SENIOR FELLOW 

3899
02:42:12,756 --> 02:42:14,090
AT THE ASIA SOCIETY CENTER ON 

3900
02:42:14,090 --> 02:42:15,058
U.S./CHINA RELATIONS. 

3901
02:42:15,058 --> 02:42:17,494
WE ARE STARTING -- GETTING A 

3902
02:42:17,494 --> 02:42:20,630
MOMENT TO DIGEST THIS JOINT 

3903
02:42:20,630 --> 02:42:21,530
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT 

3904
02:42:21,530 --> 02:42:29,372
AND CHAIRMAN KIM, AND

3905
02:42:29,372 --> 02:42:30,940
YOU ARE THE EXPERT, I MEAN, 

3906
02:42:30,940 --> 02:42:33,009
SEEMS TO ME THAT A LOT OF THE 

3907
02:42:33,009 --> 02:42:34,177
LANGUAGE HERE IS VERY VAGUE. 

3908
02:42:34,177 --> 02:42:35,579
TO BE FAIR TO THE PRESIDENT, 

3909
02:42:35,579 --> 02:42:37,113
THE FACT HE WAS ABLE TO SIT 

3910
02:42:37,113 --> 02:42:38,381
DOWN WITH CHAIRMAN KIM IS 

3911
02:42:38,381 --> 02:42:39,449
HISTORIC INN ITSELF, PERHAPS 

3912
02:42:39,449 --> 02:42:40,750
THIS IS A SIGN THINGS ARE GOING 

3913
02:42:40,750 --> 02:42:42,252
TO GET BETTER BETWEEN THE U.S. 

3914
02:42:42,252 --> 02:42:43,787
AND NORTH KOREA BUT IF HISTORY 

3915
02:42:43,787 --> 02:42:45,622
IS A GUIDE AND THIS LANGUAGE IS 

3916
02:42:45,622 --> 02:42:47,790
A GUIDE, GUARD POST, WHAT YOU 

3917
02:42:47,790 --> 02:42:48,591
MAKE OF IT? 

3918
02:42:48,591 --> 02:42:52,095
>> ON THE ONE HAND, ONE MAJOR 

3919
02:42:52,095 --> 02:42:53,330
PROBLEM THE U.S. AND NORTH 

3920
02:42:53,330 --> 02:42:55,164
KOREA HAVE HAD IS A LACK OF 

3921
02:42:55,164 --> 02:42:55,999
TRUST. 

3922
02:42:55,999 --> 02:42:57,534
IF THIS MEETING REALLY BUILD 

3923
02:42:57,534 --> 02:43:00,770
TRUST, THAT IS CERTAINLY A BOON 

3924
02:43:00,770 --> 02:43:02,038
TO THE PRESIDENT AND SOMETHING 

3925
02:43:02,038 --> 02:43:03,206
WE SHOULD COMMEND HIM FOR. 

3926
02:43:03,206 --> 02:43:04,174
I THINK WHAT'S PROBLEMATIC 

3927
02:43:04,174 --> 02:43:08,979
ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE 

3928
02:43:08,979 --> 02:43:10,513
PRESIDENT TRIED TO PLAY IT OFF 

3929
02:43:10,513 --> 02:43:11,914
AS SOMETHING THAT WENT BETTER 

3930
02:43:11,914 --> 02:43:13,083
THAN ANYONE EXPECTED AND USED A 

3931
02:43:13,083 --> 02:43:14,351
LOT OF GRAND FLOWERY LANGUAGE 

3932
02:43:14,351 --> 02:43:16,353
TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING THAT WE 

3933
02:43:16,353 --> 02:43:17,820
HAVE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH. 

3934
02:43:17,820 --> 02:43:22,692
THIS IS NOT NEW TO AMERICANS, 

3935
02:43:22,692 --> 02:43:24,494
THIS IS NOT NEW TO THE NORTH 

3936
02:43:24,494 --> 02:43:25,762
KOREANS, SIMILAR TO A DOCUMENT 

3937
02:43:25,762 --> 02:43:26,695
THAT CAME OUT IN 1993. 

3938
02:43:26,695 --> 02:43:29,232
WE SEEM TO BE BUYING THE SAME 

3939
02:43:29,232 --> 02:43:31,268
HORSE THREE TIMES. 

3940
02:43:31,268 --> 02:43:33,069
>> I'VE SEEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA 

3941
02:43:33,069 --> 02:43:36,706
PEOPLE ARE -- PEOPLE WHO ARE 

3942
02:43:36,706 --> 02:43:37,774
SUPPORTERS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP 

3943
02:43:37,774 --> 02:43:38,808
ARE POINTING OUT THE UNITED 

3944
02:43:38,808 --> 02:43:40,677
STATES AND THE DPR COMMIT TO 

3945
02:43:40,677 --> 02:43:41,711
RECOVERING REMAINS INCLUDING 

3946
02:43:41,711 --> 02:43:50,854
THE IMMEDIATE REPATRIATION OF 

3947
02:43:50,854 --> 02:43:51,421
THOSE ALREADY IDENTIFIED. 

3948
02:43:51,421 --> 02:43:52,021
HAS THAT HAPPENED BEFORE? 

3949
02:43:52,021 --> 02:43:53,456
>> I BELIEVE THAT HAS HAPPENED 

3950
02:43:53,456 --> 02:43:53,857
BEFORE. 

3951
02:43:53,857 --> 02:43:54,357
>> THAT'S NUMBER FOUR. 

3952
02:43:54,357 --> 02:44:05,936
IT SAYS REAFFIRMING THE APRIL 27

3953
02:44:05,936 --> 02:44:07,037
DECLARATION, THE DPRK COMMITS 

3954
02:44:07,037 --> 02:44:08,071
TO WORK TOWARD COMPLETE 

3955
02:44:08,071 --> 02:44:08,904
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE 

3956
02:44:08,904 --> 02:44:10,106
PENINSULA AND THE PRESIDENT WAS 

3957
02:44:10,106 --> 02:44:11,508
ASKED ABOUT THAT, HE SAID IT'S 

3958
02:44:11,508 --> 02:44:13,443
GOING TO -- HE'S GOING TO START 

3959
02:44:13,443 --> 02:44:14,244
THE PROCESS, IT'S GOING TO 

3960
02:44:14,244 --> 02:44:15,512
HAPPEN QUICKLY, IT SAYS HERE 

3961
02:44:15,512 --> 02:44:17,080
THE DPRK COMMITS TO WORK TOWARD 

3962
02:44:17,080 --> 02:44:17,647
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION. 

3963
02:44:17,647 --> 02:44:18,915
WHEN YOU READ THAT, WHAT DOES 

3964
02:44:18,915 --> 02:44:20,016
THAT SAY TO YOU? 

3965
02:44:20,016 --> 02:44:22,052
>> THERE'S A LOT GOING ON 

3966
02:44:22,052 --> 02:44:22,819
BETWEEN DENUCLEARIZATION AND 

3967
02:44:22,819 --> 02:44:23,753
THE DPRK GETTING THERE. 

3968
02:44:23,753 --> 02:44:24,654
THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT LINE 

3969
02:44:24,654 --> 02:44:33,797
IS THAT THIS IS NOT COMPLETE 

3970
02:44:33,797 --> 02:44:34,597
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH 

3971
02:44:34,597 --> 02:44:34,830
KOREA. 

3972
02:44:34,830 --> 02:44:35,899
THIS IS OF THE KOREAN 

3973
02:44:35,899 --> 02:44:36,199
PENINSULA. 

3974
02:44:36,199 --> 02:44:37,167
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE 

3975
02:44:37,167 --> 02:44:38,468
NORTH KOREANS COULD BE SAYING 

3976
02:44:38,468 --> 02:44:40,270
WE ARE NOT GOING TO REMOVE OUR 

3977
02:44:40,270 --> 02:44:41,037
NUCLEAR WEAPONS UNTIL THE U.S. 

3978
02:44:41,037 --> 02:44:42,572
GETS RID OF ITS NUCLEAR 

3979
02:44:42,572 --> 02:44:46,443
UMBRELLA OVER SOUTH KOREA, 

3980
02:44:46,443 --> 02:44:47,978
UNTIL THE U.S. REMOVES TROOPS 

3981
02:44:47,978 --> 02:44:49,245
OR STOPS FLYING BOMBERS OR STOP 

3982
02:44:49,245 --> 02:44:57,887
DOING JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES. 

3983
02:44:57,887 --> 02:44:59,022
AMAZING AMOUNT OF WIGGLE ROOM. 

3984
02:44:59,022 --> 02:45:00,457
>> THE SECOND POINT THAT IS 

3985
02:45:00,457 --> 02:45:01,992
MADE ON THIS JOINT STATEMENT IS 

3986
02:45:01,992 --> 02:45:03,526
THE UNITED STATES AND THE DPRK 

3987
02:45:03,526 --> 02:45:04,794
WILL JOIN THEIR EFFORTS TO 

3988
02:45:04,794 --> 02:45:06,029
BUILD A LASTING AND STABLE 

3989
02:45:06,029 --> 02:45:07,297
PEACE REGIME ON THE PENINSULA. 

3990
02:45:07,297 --> 02:45:08,631
>> WHAT THAT MEANS, YOUR GUESS 

3991
02:45:08,631 --> 02:45:10,466
IS AS GOOD AS MINE AND THAT'S A 

3992
02:45:10,466 --> 02:45:12,035
LOT OF WORDS SEWN TOGETHER IN 

3993
02:45:12,035 --> 02:45:12,535
AN OPTIMISTIC BOW. 

3994
02:45:12,535 --> 02:45:13,570
I DON'T THINK IT REALLY 

3995
02:45:13,570 --> 02:45:14,437
SIGNIFIES ANYTHING AT ALL. 

3996
02:45:14,437 --> 02:45:16,206
>> THE FIRST THING IN HIS JOINT 

3997
02:45:16,206 --> 02:45:17,507
STATEMENT IS THE UNITED STATES 

3998
02:45:17,507 --> 02:45:18,841
AND DPRK COMMIT TO ESTABLISH A 

3999
02:45:18,841 --> 02:45:26,383
NEW RELATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH 

4000
02:45:26,383 --> 02:45:27,917
THE DESIRE OF THE PEOPLE'S OF 

4001
02:45:27,917 --> 02:45:29,251
THE TWO COUNTRIES FOR PEACE AND 

4002
02:45:29,251 --> 02:45:29,552
PROSPERITY. 

4003
02:45:29,552 --> 02:45:29,919
>> SOUNDS NICE. 

4004
02:45:29,919 --> 02:45:31,554
I MEAN, I LIKE THE MELODY OF 

4005
02:45:31,554 --> 02:45:32,055
THAT SENTENCE. 

4006
02:45:32,055 --> 02:45:36,526
I THINK IF THEY WANTED TO SHOW 

4007
02:45:36,526 --> 02:45:37,527
THAT SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT, 

4008
02:45:37,527 --> 02:45:38,661
THEY COULD'VE SPOKEN ABOUT 

4009
02:45:38,661 --> 02:45:39,261
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIPS OR 

4010
02:45:39,261 --> 02:45:39,829
INTENTIONS TO ESTABLISH 

4011
02:45:39,829 --> 02:45:40,630
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. 

4012
02:45:40,630 --> 02:45:45,068
THIS IS JUST VERY, VERY VAGUE, 

4013
02:45:45,068 --> 02:45:45,535
VERY BOILERPLATE. 

4014
02:45:45,535 --> 02:45:51,941
>> YET AS YOU POINT OUT, IF 

4015
02:45:51,941 --> 02:45:52,976
CHAIRMAN KIM FEELS COMFORTABLE 

4016
02:45:52,976 --> 02:45:54,010
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT'S 

4017
02:45:54,010 --> 02:45:55,044
INTERESTING, I HAVE INTERVIEWED 

4018
02:45:55,044 --> 02:45:56,279
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWICE AND THIS 

4019
02:45:56,279 --> 02:45:57,580
WAS BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT BUT 

4020
02:45:57,580 --> 02:45:58,981
RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME THAT HE 

4021
02:45:58,981 --> 02:46:01,851
ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY, AS 

4022
02:46:01,851 --> 02:46:03,420
MANY HAVE NOTED, HE IS VERY 

4023
02:46:03,420 --> 02:46:04,554
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU ARE FACE-TO-

4024
02:46:04,554 --> 02:46:05,722
FACE AND HAVING A DISCUSSION 

4025
02:46:05,722 --> 02:46:06,990
WITH HIM THAN HE IS GENERALLY 

4026
02:46:06,990 --> 02:46:08,658
IN FRONT OF A CROWD OR IN FRONT 

4027
02:46:08,658 --> 02:46:09,492
OF A CAMERA. 

4028
02:46:09,492 --> 02:46:10,727
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE WILL 

4029
02:46:10,727 --> 02:46:14,431
SAY TO YOU, THERE'S A REASON 

4030
02:46:14,431 --> 02:46:15,598
WHY PEOPLE TAKE TO HIM. 

4031
02:46:15,598 --> 02:46:16,533
HE IS CHARISMATIC, ENGAGING, HE 

4032
02:46:16,533 --> 02:46:17,600
DRAWS YOU INTO THE CONVERSATION 

4033
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:21,370
AND SO IF CHAIRMAN KIM FEELS AS 

4034
02:46:21,370 --> 02:46:22,338
PRESIDENT TRUMP SUGGESTED THAT 

4035
02:46:22,338 --> 02:46:23,940
HE MIGHT FEEL WITH -- WITHIN A 

4036
02:46:23,940 --> 02:46:28,378
MEETING -- WITHIN A MINUTE, 

4037
02:46:28,378 --> 02:46:30,513
COULD THAT GO A LONG WAY IN AT 

4038
02:46:30,513 --> 02:46:35,218
LEAST ALLOWING SOME OF THESE 

4039
02:46:35,218 --> 02:46:36,252
IMPORTANT NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE 

4040
02:46:36,252 --> 02:46:37,821
GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE LEVELS 

4041
02:46:37,821 --> 02:46:38,855
BELOW THE PRESIDENT TO TAKE 

4042
02:46:38,855 --> 02:46:40,390
PLACE AND SOMETHING CONCRETE 

4043
02:46:40,390 --> 02:46:40,990
ULTIMATELY COMING FROM THIS? 

4044
02:46:40,990 --> 02:46:41,491
>> CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. 

4045
02:46:41,491 --> 02:46:42,291
WHAT I AM PUSHING AGAINST AND 

4046
02:46:42,291 --> 02:46:44,693
WHAT IS FRUSTRATING IS THE WAY 

4047
02:46:44,693 --> 02:46:53,970
THAT TRUMP SPOKE ABOUT WHAT WAS 

4048
02:46:53,970 --> 02:46:55,472
GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS 

4049
02:46:55,472 --> 02:46:56,438
MEETING DURING THE MEETING. 

4050
02:46:56,438 --> 02:46:57,340
THIS WENT BETTER THAN ANYONE 

4051
02:46:57,340 --> 02:46:57,807
COULD'VE EXPECTED. 

4052
02:46:57,807 --> 02:46:59,041
AND THEN SAYING THAT AND HAVING 

4053
02:46:59,041 --> 02:46:59,909
THIS VERY BOILERPLATE STATEMENT 

4054
02:46:59,909 --> 02:47:00,609
COMING OUT OF THAT. 

4055
02:47:00,609 --> 02:47:01,744
SO I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT 

4056
02:47:01,744 --> 02:47:04,380
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A MUCH 

4057
02:47:04,380 --> 02:47:05,314
BETTER AND HEALTHIER 

4058
02:47:05,314 --> 02:47:09,252
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED 

4059
02:47:09,252 --> 02:47:10,520
STATES AND NORTH KOREA, BUT 

4060
02:47:10,520 --> 02:47:11,620
IT'S HARD TO KNOW BECAUSE OUR 

4061
02:47:11,620 --> 02:47:12,788
EXPECTATIONS HAVE BEEN SO 

4062
02:47:12,788 --> 02:47:13,923
MANIPULATED. 

4063
02:47:13,923 --> 02:47:16,993
>> AND YOU LOOK IN THIS 

4064
02:47:16,993 --> 02:47:22,398
DOCUMENT, THE DOCUMENT SAYS 

4065
02:47:22,398 --> 02:47:23,433
HAVING ACKNOWLEDGED THE U.S. 

4066
02:47:23,433 --> 02:47:25,935
DPRK SUMMIT, THE FIRST IN 

4067
02:47:25,935 --> 02:47:27,804
HISTORY, WAS OF GREAT 

4068
02:47:27,804 --> 02:47:28,571
SIGNIFICANCE IN OVERCOMING 

4069
02:47:28,571 --> 02:47:29,339
DECADES OF TENSIONS AND 

4070
02:47:29,339 --> 02:47:30,607
HOSTILITIES BETWEEN THE TWO AND 

4071
02:47:30,607 --> 02:47:31,807
FOR OPENING UP A NEW FUTURE, 

4072
02:47:31,807 --> 02:47:34,477
THAT COULD BE PART OF WHAT 

4073
02:47:34,477 --> 02:47:35,411
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS 

4074
02:47:35,411 --> 02:47:38,181
THE PRESIDENT -- BECAUSE WE HAVE

4075
02:47:38,181 --> 02:47:39,983
HEARD FROM OTHER ANALYSTS SAYING

4076
02:47:39,983 --> 02:47:41,384
NORTH KOREANS HAVE ALWAYS 

4077
02:47:41,384 --> 02:47:43,853
WANTED THIS, THIS MEETING, NOW 

4078
02:47:43,853 --> 02:47:49,025
THAT THEY HAVE IT, IT IS 

4079
02:47:49,025 --> 02:47:50,560
INCUMBENT ON THEM TO DELIVER ON 

4080
02:47:50,560 --> 02:47:52,095
SOME OF THE THINGS THE UNITED 

4081
02:47:52,095 --> 02:47:53,596
STATES IS EXPECTING ON THE 

4082
02:47:53,596 --> 02:47:53,896
OTHER HAND. 

4083
02:47:53,896 --> 02:47:54,898
THERE WILL BE CRITICS WHO SAY 

4084
02:47:54,898 --> 02:47:55,932
BY GRANTING THIS MEETING, 

4085
02:47:55,932 --> 02:47:58,902
PROVIDING HIM THIS LEGITIMACY, 

4086
02:47:58,902 --> 02:48:00,436
THAT'S ALREADY A WIN FOR THE 

4087
02:48:00,436 --> 02:48:01,704
NORTH KOREANS AND THEY DON'T 

4088
02:48:01,704 --> 02:48:02,972
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE 

4089
02:48:02,972 --> 02:48:06,809
THEY'VE ALREADY GOT THIS VIDEO 

4090
02:48:06,809 --> 02:48:08,578
AND THEY CAN PLAY THAT OVER AND 

4091
02:48:08,578 --> 02:48:09,879
OVER AGAIN OF CHAIRMAN KIM 

4092
02:48:09,879 --> 02:48:11,147
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT AND 

4093
02:48:11,147 --> 02:48:12,382
KIM SAYING TO HIS PEOPLE IT'S 

4094
02:48:12,382 --> 02:48:13,716
BECAUSE WE ARE A NUCLEAR NATION 

4095
02:48:13,716 --> 02:48:15,552
THAT WE GOT THE SEAT AT THE 

4096
02:48:15,552 --> 02:48:15,785
TABLE. 

4097
02:48:15,785 --> 02:48:16,853
>> TRUMP SAID THAT KIM JONG-UN 

4098
02:48:16,853 --> 02:48:17,954
WAS A VERY SMART NEGOTIATOR. 

4099
02:48:17,954 --> 02:48:18,620
PRAISED HIS ABILITY. 

4100
02:48:18,620 --> 02:48:20,890
AND I THINK TRUMP IS RIGHT ON 

4101
02:48:20,890 --> 02:48:22,025
THAT BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES 

4102
02:48:22,025 --> 02:48:29,999
SEEM WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW THAT

4103
02:48:29,999 --> 02:48:31,501
KIM JONG-UN GOT THE UPPER HAND. 

4104
02:48:31,501 --> 02:48:32,835
>> LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 

4105
02:48:32,835 --> 02:48:34,237
WHILE WE AWAIT REMARKS BY THE 

4106
02:48:34,237 --> 02:48:35,138
PRESIDENT, LOOKING AT A LIVE 

4107
02:48:35,138 --> 02:48:36,005
PICTURE FROM SINGAPORE. 

4108
02:48:36,005 --> 02:48:36,739
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. 

4109
02:48:36,739 --> 02:48:37,239
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 

4110

4112
02:52:25,367 --> 02:52:27,136
>>>  HI, EVERYONE, I'M VLADAMIR

DUTHIERS.

02:52:27,403 --> 02:52:29,705
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. 

4115
02:52:29,705 --> 02:52:30,439
IT IS ABOUT 4:00 P.M. 

4116
02:52:30,439 --> 02:52:31,874
IN SINGAPORE, 4:00 A.M. 

4117
02:52:31,874 --> 02:52:32,908
HERE ON THE EAST COAST. 

4118

QUOTE, A TERRIFIC RELATIONSHIP. 

4146
02:53:11,647 --> 02:53:13,449
KIM JONG-UN SAID, QUOTE, IT WAS 

4147

4161
02:53:35,037 --> 02:53:37,806

4162
02:53:37,806 --> 02:53:38,207

02:53:42,878 --> 02:53:44,981
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID WE'RE 

4169
02:53:44,981 --> 02:53:48,084

TALENTED MAN. 

4205
02:54:40,469 --> 02:54:43,372
I ALSO LEARNED THAT HE LOVES 

4206
02:54:43,372 --> 02:54:44,707
HIS COUNTRY VERY MUCH. 

4207
02:54:44,707 --> 02:54:45,207
>> ALL RIGHT. 

4208
02:54:45,207 --> 02:54:46,208
CBS NEWS POLITICAL 

4209
02:54:46,208 --> 02:54:49,011

02:54:49,011 --> 02:54:51,580

4211
02:54:51,580 --> 02:54:53,149
SO, ED, FIRST IMPRESSIONS AFTER 

4212
02:54:53,149 --> 02:54:55,518

4213
02:54:55,518 --> 02:54:56,085
STATEMENT BETWEEN PRESIDENT

02:54:56,085 --> 02:54:57,953
TRUMP AND CHAIRMAN KIM. 

4215
02:54:57,953 --> 02:54:59,922
AFTER THE PRESIDENT CALLED  IT 

4216
02:54:59,922 --> 02:55:01,090
A COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, 

4217
02:55:01,090 --> 02:55:01,791
SUGGESTING THAT 

4218
02:55:01,791 --> 02:55:03,192
DENUCLEARIZATION WOULD HAPPEN 

4219
02:55:03,192 --> 02:55:04,093
VERY, VERY QUICKLY, WHAT ARE 

4220
02:55:04,093 --> 02:55:04,460
YOUR THOUGHTS? 

4221
02:55:04,460 --> 02:55:05,895
>> MY FIRST THOUGHTS ARE HOW DO 

4222
02:55:05,895 --> 02:55:08,497
WE KNOW THAT AND HOW WILL WE 

4223
02:55:08,497 --> 02:55:09,431
VERIFY THAT IT'S HAPPENED. 

4224
02:55:09,431 --> 02:55:11,767
LOOK, I THINK WE HAVE TO PAUSE 

4225
02:55:11,767 --> 02:55:12,934
AND APPRECIATE THE HISTORY OF 

4226
02:55:12,934 --> 02:55:14,370
WHAT'S TRANSPIRED HERE 

4227
02:55:14,370 --> 02:55:16,572
OVERNIGHT IN THE UNITED STATES 

4228
02:55:16,572 --> 02:55:18,607
AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN ASIA. 

4229
02:55:18,607 --> 02:55:19,709
WE'VE NOW SEEN AND HEARD 

4230
02:55:19,709 --> 02:55:21,510
CHAIRMAN KIM, MOST OF THE WORLD 

4231
02:55:21,510 --> 02:55:24,013
HAS SEEN AND HEARD CHAIRMAN KIM 

4232
02:55:24,013 --> 02:55:24,814
UNFILTERED FOR THE FIRST TIME, 

4233
02:55:24,814 --> 02:55:26,782
AND THESE TWO HAVE NOW SPENT A 

4234
02:55:26,782 --> 02:55:28,084
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IN 

4235
02:55:28,084 --> 02:55:30,720
EACH OTHER'S PRESENCE WHICH IN 

4236
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:32,154
AND OF ITSELF IS HISTORIC. 

4237
02:55:32,154 --> 02:55:33,656
THIS DOCUMENT, IF IT EVER DOES 

4238
02:55:33,656 --> 02:55:35,391
PAN OUT IS ALSO HISTORIC, BUT 

4239
02:55:35,391 --> 02:55:37,693
WHAT EXACTLY IT MEAN, WHAT IS 

4240
02:55:37,693 --> 02:55:39,528
THE DEFINITION OF, AS THEY PUT 

4241
02:55:39,528 --> 02:55:40,363
IT, DENUCLEARIZATION ON THE 

4242
02:55:40,363 --> 02:55:40,763
KOREAN PENINSULA? 

4243
02:55:40,763 --> 02:55:43,532
HOW WILL WE AND THE REST OF THE 

4244
02:55:43,532 --> 02:55:44,500
WORLD KNOW THAT THIS HAS 

4245
02:55:44,500 --> 02:55:46,869
HAPPENED, AND WHAT OTHER STEPS 

4246
02:55:46,869 --> 02:55:48,504
HAVE TO BE TAKE TONE MAKE THAT 

4247
02:55:48,504 --> 02:55:48,737
HAPPEN? 

4248
02:55:48,737 --> 02:55:49,972
WHAT WILL THE DIPLOMACY LOOK 

4249
02:55:49,972 --> 02:55:51,507
LIKE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN? 

4250
02:55:51,507 --> 02:55:53,409
WHO WILL BE DOING THAT, HOW 

4251
02:55:53,409 --> 02:55:54,510
MUCH AND WHERE? 

4252
02:55:54,510 --> 02:55:55,344
A LOT OF QUESTIONS REMAIN. 

4253
02:55:55,344 --> 02:55:56,712
THE PRESIDENT CAN SAY THAT THIS 

4254
02:55:56,712 --> 02:55:57,980
IS GOING TO HAPPEN VERY SOON. 

4255
02:55:57,980 --> 02:55:58,981
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE ABLE TO 

4256
02:55:58,981 --> 02:56:00,583
TOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS AND 

4257
02:56:00,583 --> 02:56:03,986
THE FACT THAT HE IS NOW AND 

4258
02:56:03,986 --> 02:56:04,687
FOREVER THE FIRST U.S. 

4259
02:56:04,687 --> 02:56:06,489
PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH THE 

4260
02:56:06,489 --> 02:56:07,690
NORTH KOREAN LEADER. 

4261
02:56:07,690 --> 02:56:08,490
BUT, AGAIN, U.S. PRESIDENTS 

4262
02:56:08,490 --> 02:56:09,792
HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE AND 

4263
02:56:09,792 --> 02:56:10,693
THEY'VE BEEN DUPED, AND WE'LL 

4264
02:56:10,693 --> 02:56:12,695
SEE WHETHER OR NOT THIS ONE IS 

4265
02:56:12,695 --> 02:56:13,963
ANY DIFFERENT AND WHY THE TRUMP 

4266
02:56:13,963 --> 02:56:14,664
ADMINISTRATION AT LEAST 

4267
02:56:14,664 --> 02:56:16,265
BELIEVES IT WOULD BE ANY 

4268
02:56:16,265 --> 02:56:16,532
DIFFERENT 

4269
02:56:16,532 --> 02:56:16,799
>> YEAH. 

4270
02:56:16,799 --> 02:56:18,167
I MEAN, ED, THAT'S A GREAT 

4271
02:56:18,167 --> 02:56:18,400
POINT. 

4272
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:19,268
WE'RE GOING TO BE OBVIOUSLY 

4273
02:56:19,268 --> 02:56:20,503
WATCHING TO SEE HOW QUICKLY 

4274
02:56:20,503 --> 02:56:23,272
SOME OF THESE NOTES AND THESE 

4275
02:56:23,272 --> 02:56:24,807
POINTS THAT ARE IN THIS 

4276
02:56:24,807 --> 02:56:25,374
DOCUMENT GET IMPLEMENTED. 

4277
02:56:25,374 --> 02:56:27,209
AND AS YOU POINT OUT, THE NORTH 

4278
02:56:27,209 --> 02:56:28,344
KOREANS HAVE SUGGESTED IN 

4279
02:56:28,344 --> 02:56:30,413
DOCUMENTS PRIOR TO THIS, PRIOR 

4280
02:56:30,413 --> 02:56:31,113
TO THIS HISTORIC MEETING 

4281
02:56:31,113 --> 02:56:31,880
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

4282
02:56:31,880 --> 02:56:33,015
CHAIRMAN KIM THAT THEY WOULD DO 

4283
02:56:33,015 --> 02:56:35,785
THE THINGS THAT ARE LISTED  IN 

4284
02:56:35,785 --> 02:56:36,585
THIS VERY DOCUMENT AS WELL. 

4285
02:56:36,585 --> 02:56:38,220
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE FOR 

4286
02:56:38,220 --> 02:56:39,188
YOU, ED, IS SOME OF THE 

4287
02:56:39,188 --> 02:56:42,591
LANGUAGE PRESIDENT TRUMP USED 

4288
02:56:42,591 --> 02:56:44,560
IN DESCRIBING THE DICTATOR KIM 

4289
02:56:44,560 --> 02:56:45,795
JONG-UN, LANGUAGE THAT WAS VERY 

4290
02:56:45,795 --> 02:56:46,795
BECOMING OF CHAIRMAN KIM. 

4291
02:56:46,795 --> 02:56:48,330
HE CALLED HIM TERRIFIC. 

4292
02:56:48,330 --> 02:56:49,498
HE SAID HE WAS A WORTHY 

4293
02:56:49,498 --> 02:56:51,167
NEGOTIATOR, A VERY TAL EMENTED 

4294
02:56:51,167 --> 02:56:51,833
MAN WHO LOVES HIS COUNTRY. 

4295
02:56:51,833 --> 02:56:53,269
CONTRAST THAT WITH SOME OF THE 

4296
02:56:53,269 --> 02:56:54,770
LANGUAGE THE PRESIDENT HAS USED 

4297
02:56:54,770 --> 02:56:56,372
WITH SOME OF OUR CLOSEST 

4298
02:56:56,372 --> 02:56:57,373
ALLIES, SPECIFICALLY AS IT 

4299
02:56:57,373 --> 02:56:59,809
RELATES TO THE G7 SUMMIT THAT 

4300
02:56:59,809 --> 02:57:00,775
JUST TOOK PLACE THIS WEEKEND. 

4301
02:57:00,775 --> 02:57:01,076
>> RIGHT. 

4302
02:57:01,076 --> 02:57:02,444
AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN 

4303
02:57:02,444 --> 02:57:03,512
HERE IN WASHINGTON AND OTHER 

4304
02:57:03,512 --> 02:57:05,548
PARTS OF THE WORLD ABOUT HOW 

4305
02:57:05,548 --> 02:57:06,982
THAT ALL WENT, THAT THE 

4306
02:57:06,982 --> 02:57:09,185
PRESIDENT WAS TALKING TOUGH AND 

4307
02:57:09,185 --> 02:57:10,820
BEING A PIT PETULENT, PERHAPS 

4308
02:57:10,820 --> 02:57:15,224
WITH SOME OF OUR CLOSEST 

4309
02:57:15,224 --> 02:57:16,525
ALLIES, BUT NOW SHOWS UP UP 

4310
02:57:16,525 --> 02:57:17,193
FLATTERING THE NORTH KOREAN 

4311
02:57:17,193 --> 02:57:17,426
LEADER. 

4312
02:57:17,426 --> 02:57:18,694
THERE IS ONE STREAM OF THOUGHT 

4313
02:57:18,694 --> 02:57:19,829
HERE IN WASHINGTON THAT PERHAPS 

4314
02:57:19,829 --> 02:57:21,363
THE PRESIDENT DID WHAT HE DID 

4315
02:57:21,363 --> 02:57:22,298
AND SAID WHAT HE SAID ABOUT 

4316
02:57:22,298 --> 02:57:23,466
JUSTIN TRUDEAU AND OTHER 

4317
02:57:23,466 --> 02:57:25,367
LEADERS IN A BID TO SORT OF AT 

4318
02:57:25,367 --> 02:57:27,069
THE LAST SECOND SHOW CHAIRMAN 

4319
02:57:27,069 --> 02:57:29,538
KIM HOW SERIOUS HE WOULD BE 

4320
02:57:29,538 --> 02:57:30,739
ABOUT BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY 

4321
02:57:30,739 --> 02:57:32,808
HIMSELF, THAT HE NEEDED TO 

4322
02:57:32,808 --> 02:57:34,610
DEMONSTRATE SOME TOUGHNESS ON 

4323
02:57:34,610 --> 02:57:36,278
THE GLOBAL STAGE BEFORE HE GOT 

4324
02:57:36,278 --> 02:57:37,946
TO SINGAPORE, MAYBE THE MESSAGE 

4325
02:57:37,946 --> 02:57:39,815
WAS RECEIVED THAT WAY, BUT, 

4326
02:57:39,815 --> 02:57:41,617
LOOK, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE CAN 

4327
02:57:41,617 --> 02:57:43,719
TAKE SOME COMFORT PERHAPS IN 

4328
02:57:43,719 --> 02:57:45,988
THE FACT THAT THE MARKETS AT 

4329
02:57:45,988 --> 02:57:47,790
LEAST DIDN'T REACT ADVERSELY ON 

4330
02:57:47,790 --> 02:57:49,992
MONDAY AND DON'T APPEAR TO BE 

4331
02:57:49,992 --> 02:57:51,226
PREPARING TO DO THAT TODAY. 

4332
02:57:51,226 --> 02:57:52,194
YOU KNOW, THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC 

4333
02:57:52,194 --> 02:57:53,662
WORLD ORDER AT LEAST STILL 

4334
02:57:53,662 --> 02:57:55,097
APPEARS TO BE INTACT EVEN IF 

4335
02:57:55,097 --> 02:57:56,232
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 

4336
02:57:56,232 --> 02:57:57,366
ADMINISTRATION ARE GOING TO 

4337
02:57:57,366 --> 02:57:58,667
HAVE SOME CLEANUP TO DO WITH 

4338
02:57:58,667 --> 02:58:00,369
CANADA, WITH GERMANY, WITH THE 

4339
02:58:00,369 --> 02:58:00,569
U.K. 

4340
02:58:00,569 --> 02:58:00,869
AND OTHERS. 

4341
02:58:00,869 --> 02:58:04,273
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY 

4342
02:58:04,273 --> 02:58:06,008
WILL BE JUST AS SKEPTICAL, OUR 

4343
02:58:06,008 --> 02:58:07,309
CLOSEST ALLIES ABOUT WHAT HAS 

4344
02:58:07,309 --> 02:58:07,943
TRANSPIRED TODAY AND ARE GOING 

4345
02:58:07,943 --> 02:58:10,512
TO WANT TO LEARN MORE AS WELL. 

4346
02:58:10,512 --> 02:58:12,548
BUT IF ALL THAT OVER THE 

4347
02:58:12,548 --> 02:58:13,916
WEEKEND WAS SOME TOUGH TALK 

4348
02:58:13,916 --> 02:58:16,685
AHEAD OF THIS AND THERE AREN'T 

4349
02:58:16,685 --> 02:58:19,321
ANY OTHER REPERCUSSIONS, THEN 

4350
02:58:19,321 --> 02:58:20,589
PERHAPS EVERYTHING WILL BE 

4351
02:58:20,589 --> 02:58:21,023
FINE. 

4352
02:58:21,023 --> 02:58:22,291
BUT IT IS A TELLING CONTRAST, 

4353
02:58:22,291 --> 02:58:22,991
AND ONE THAT'S CERTAINLY 

4354
02:58:22,991 --> 02:58:25,094
DISTURBING  TO A LOT OF THE 

4355
02:58:25,094 --> 02:58:25,760
PRESIDENT'S CRITICS THAT HE 

4356
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:27,763
WOULD GET SO NASTY WITH OUR 

4357
02:58:27,763 --> 02:58:29,365
ALLIES AND THEN SHOW UP IN 

4358
02:58:29,365 --> 02:58:32,368
SINGAPORE AND SAY SUCH NICE 

4359
02:58:32,368 --> 02:58:33,369
THINGS AND REALLY ROLL OUT THE 

4360
02:58:33,369 --> 02:58:35,471
RED CARPET FOR WHAT MOST OF THE 

4361
02:58:35,471 --> 02:58:36,672
WORLD HISTORY AND CERTAINLY 

4362
02:58:36,672 --> 02:58:38,908
THROUGHOUT HIS REIGN IN THE 

4363
02:58:38,908 --> 02:58:42,711
LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS HAS 

4364
02:58:42,711 --> 02:58:43,445
BEEN DESCRIBED AS A DESPOT. 

4365
02:58:43,445 --> 02:58:45,314
>> YEAH, ED, AND IN THE TIME 

4366
02:58:45,314 --> 02:58:46,215
YOU'VE BEEN COVERING 

4367
02:58:46,215 --> 02:58:47,817
WASHINGTON, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD 

4368
02:58:47,817 --> 02:58:49,585
A PRESIDENTIAL -- A MEMBER OF A 

4369
02:58:49,585 --> 02:58:50,352
PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION 

4370
02:58:50,352 --> 02:58:51,653
SAYING THAT THERE'S A SPECIAL 

4371
02:58:51,653 --> 02:58:54,623
PLACE IN HELL FOR THE LEADER OF 

4372
02:58:54,623 --> 02:58:55,824
ONE OF OUR CLOSEST ALLIES? 

4373
02:58:55,824 --> 02:58:58,060
I MEAN, LANGUAGE LIKE THAT IS 

4374
02:58:58,060 --> 02:59:00,963
TYPICALLY USED FOR PEOPLE LIKE 

4375
02:59:00,963 --> 02:59:02,765
KIM JONG-UN AND BASHAR AL-ASSAD 

4376
02:59:02,765 --> 02:59:04,567
AND OTHER HORRIBLE LEADERS OF 

4377
02:59:04,567 --> 02:59:08,571
ROGUE REGIMES AND NOT ONE OF 

4378
02:59:08,571 --> 02:59:09,738
AMERICA'S OLDEST ALLIES, 

4379
02:59:09,738 --> 02:59:11,373
INCLUDING A PRIME MINISTER WHO 

4380
02:59:11,373 --> 02:59:12,273
-- AND PREVIOUS PRIME MINISTERS 

4381
02:59:12,273 --> 02:59:14,009
IN CANADA WHO HAVE SUPPORTED 

4382
02:59:14,009 --> 02:59:15,411
THE UNITED STATES' EFFORT, FOR 

4383
02:59:15,411 --> 02:59:17,313
EXAMPLE, IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON 

4384
02:59:17,313 --> 02:59:17,713
TERROR. 

4385
02:59:17,713 --> 02:59:18,013
>> EXACTLY. 

4386
02:59:18,013 --> 02:59:18,914
SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL WOULD BE 

4387
02:59:18,914 --> 02:59:21,217
RESERVED FOR THOSE GUYS AND NOT 

4388
02:59:21,217 --> 02:59:22,418
FOR THE CANADIAN PRIME 

4389
02:59:22,418 --> 02:59:22,685
MINISTER. 

4390
02:59:22,685 --> 02:59:24,252
AND WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT ON 

4391
02:59:24,252 --> 02:59:26,388
MONDAY AT LEAST THERE WERE 

4392
02:59:26,388 --> 02:59:27,590
OTHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

4393
02:59:27,590 --> 02:59:29,124
OFFICIALS WHO SUGGESTED THAT 

4394
02:59:29,124 --> 02:59:30,525
PETER NAVARRO, THE PRESIDENT'S 

4395
02:59:30,525 --> 02:59:34,163
TOP TRADE ENVOY WHO SAID THOSE 

4396
02:59:34,163 --> 02:59:35,197
THINGS ABOUT JUSTIN TRUDEAU, 

4397
02:59:35,197 --> 02:59:36,031
THOSE OTHER ADMINISTRATION 

4398
02:59:36,031 --> 02:59:36,665
OFFICIALS SUGGESTED THEY 

4399
02:59:36,665 --> 02:59:40,635
WOULDN'T HAVE GONE THAT FAR AND 

4400
02:59:40,635 --> 02:59:43,372
THAT PERHAPS MR. NAVARRO, YOU 

4401
02:59:43,372 --> 02:59:44,373
KNOW -- WOULDN'T NECESSARILY 

4402
02:59:44,373 --> 02:59:45,407
FACE CONSEQUENCES, BUT ISN'T 

4403
02:59:45,407 --> 02:59:47,009
NECESSARILY SPEAKING ON BEHALF 

4404
02:59:47,009 --> 02:59:48,010
OF AN ADMINISTRATION THAT 

4405
02:59:48,010 --> 02:59:50,512
AGREES UNANIMOUSLY WITH WHAT HE 

4406
02:59:50,512 --> 02:59:50,712
SAID. 

4407
02:59:50,712 --> 02:59:51,714
WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT 

4408
02:59:51,714 --> 02:59:53,549
NAVARRO HAS NOT BEEN HELD IN 

4409
02:59:53,549 --> 02:59:55,383
HIGHEST REGARD BY THE PRESIDENT 

4410
02:59:55,383 --> 02:59:56,051
AND BY OTHER OFFICIALS AS WELL, 

4411
02:59:56,051 --> 02:59:57,620
AND HAS BEEN KNOWTO SAY THE 

4412
02:59:57,620 --> 02:59:59,622
KINDS OF THINGS THAT HE SAID 

4413
02:59:59,622 --> 03:00:00,789
OVER THE WEEKEND. 

4414
03:00:00,789 --> 03:00:02,024
BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY COULD BE 

4415
03:00:02,024 --> 03:00:03,826
CAUSING GREAT HEADACHES FOR A 

4416
03:00:03,826 --> 03:00:05,027
LOT OF OUR ALLIES. 

4417
03:00:05,027 --> 03:00:06,929
AND WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT 

4418
03:00:06,929 --> 03:00:08,530
THAT THE PEOPLE LIKE NAVARRO 

4419
03:00:08,530 --> 03:00:10,499
ARE NOT INVOLVED WITH WHAT'S 

4420
03:00:10,499 --> 03:00:11,133
TRANSPIRED TODAY IN SINGAPORE, 

4421
03:00:11,133 --> 03:00:12,501
THAT THIS HAS BEEN DRIVEN SO 

4422
03:00:12,501 --> 03:00:14,904
MUCH MORE BY THE SECRETARY OF 

4423
03:00:14,904 --> 03:00:15,571
STATE, BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY 

4424
03:00:15,571 --> 03:00:18,307
ADVISER, BY THE CHIEF OF STAFF 

4425
03:00:18,307 --> 03:00:20,609
WHO ARE ALL THERE WITH THE 

4426
03:00:20,609 --> 03:00:22,544
PRESIDENT AND SEEM TO HAVE A 

4427
03:00:22,544 --> 03:00:24,146
BETTER SENSE AND A TIGHTER 

4428
03:00:24,146 --> 03:00:25,146
CONTROL OVER WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

4429
03:00:25,146 --> 03:00:27,216
IS DOING AND SAYING AT THIS 

4430
03:00:27,216 --> 03:00:28,317
HOUR THERE IN ASIA. 

4431
03:00:28,317 --> 03:00:29,618
>> ED, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

4432
03:00:29,618 --> 03:00:30,552
IF YOU'RE WATCHING YOUR SCREEN 

4433
03:00:30,552 --> 03:00:34,023
RIGHT NOW, WE ARE LOOKING AT A 

4434
03:00:34,023 --> 03:00:34,623
HIGHLY-PRODUCED VIDEO HERE, 

4435
03:00:34,623 --> 03:00:35,357
BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE A 

4436
03:00:35,357 --> 03:00:35,791
PROPAGANDA VIDEO. 

4437
03:00:35,791 --> 03:00:37,826
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY 

4438
03:00:37,826 --> 03:00:38,059
SOUND. 

4439
03:00:38,059 --> 03:00:39,528
I'LL ASK THE CONTROL ROOM IF 

4440
03:00:39,528 --> 03:00:41,196
THERE'S ANY SOUND, BUT WHAT 

4441
03:00:41,196 --> 03:00:43,198
REPORTERS ARE BEING -- OR ARE 

4442
03:00:43,198 --> 03:00:48,937
WITNESSING RIGHT NOW -- LET'S 

4443
03:00:48,937 --> 03:00:49,237
WATCH THIS. 

4444
03:00:49,237 --> 03:00:54,944
THIS IS INCREDIBLE. 

4445
03:00:54,944 --> 03:01:13,829
[ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE  ] 

4446
03:01:13,829 --> 03:01:23,005
[ JET NOISE  ] [ SPEAKING 

4447
03:01:23,005 --> 03:01:28,043
FOREIGN LANGUAGE  ] 

4448
03:01:32,280 --> 03:01:34,416
>> THIS IS OBVIOUSLY IN KOREAN, 

4449
03:01:34,416 --> 03:01:37,319
BUT YOU'RE SEEING -- AT LEAST 

4450
03:01:37,319 --> 03:01:41,123
THE INITIAL IMAGES OF KIM JONG-

4451
03:01:41,123 --> 03:01:41,690
UN SORT OF GREETING PEOPLE 

4452
03:01:41,690 --> 03:01:44,026
WITHIN HIS COUNTRY, I DON'T 

4453
03:01:44,026 --> 03:01:45,627
KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS. 

4454
03:01:45,627 --> 03:01:46,895
ISAAC STONE FISH IS JOINING ME. 

4455
03:01:46,895 --> 03:01:47,696
HE'S AN ANALYST WHO'S BEEN 

4456
03:01:47,696 --> 03:01:48,597
COVERING THIS HISTORIC SUMMIT 

4457
03:01:48,597 --> 03:01:50,799
WITH ME FOR THE LAST SIX HOURS 

4458
03:01:50,799 --> 03:01:51,366
OR SO. 

4459
03:01:51,366 --> 03:01:53,368
ISAAC, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 

4460
03:01:53,368 --> 03:01:53,569
THIS? 

4461
03:01:53,569 --> 03:01:56,405
>> CERTAINLY VERY STRIKING THAT 

4462
03:01:56,405 --> 03:01:58,440
THE NORTH KOREANS WERE ABLE TO 

4463
03:01:58,440 --> 03:02:02,344
GET THIS VIDEO SHOWN, AND WHAT 

4464
03:02:02,344 --> 03:02:05,314
IT SEEMS TO BE SAYING IS THE 

4465
03:02:05,314 --> 03:02:07,116
KOREAN WAR WAS DEVASTATING FOR 

4466
03:02:07,116 --> 03:02:08,317
NORTH KOREA AND THE NORTH 

4467
03:02:08,317 --> 03:02:10,819
KOREAN PEOPLE FACED A LOT OF 

4468
03:02:10,819 --> 03:02:12,321
HARDSHIPS OVER THE DECADES, BUT 

4469
03:02:12,321 --> 03:02:13,622
UNDER THE WONDERFUL LEADERSHIP 

4470
03:02:13,622 --> 03:02:16,825
OF KIM JONG-UN THEY'VE MANAGED 

4471
03:02:16,825 --> 03:02:17,892
TO DEVELOP THEIR ECONOMY, 

4472
03:02:17,892 --> 03:02:20,529
THEY'VE MANAGED TO BRING 

4473
03:02:20,529 --> 03:02:21,496
THEMSELVES INTO A PRIDEFUL 

4474
03:02:21,496 --> 03:02:23,599
PLACE IN THE WORLD COMMUNITY. 

4475
03:02:23,599 --> 03:02:24,499
I DON'T SPEAK ANY KOREAN. 

4476
03:02:24,499 --> 03:02:26,301
I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY 

4477
03:02:26,301 --> 03:02:27,503
THEY'RE SAYING IN THE VIDEO, 

4478
03:02:27,503 --> 03:02:30,105
BUT IT'S JUST SUCH A STRIKING 

4479
03:02:30,105 --> 03:02:31,206
SERIES OF IMAGES TO SEE THE 

4480
03:02:31,206 --> 03:02:34,343
AMERICAN AND GLOBAL PRESS CORPS 

4481
03:02:34,343 --> 03:02:36,745
TO SIT THERE AND WATCH AS WE 

4482
03:02:36,745 --> 03:02:38,914
WAIT FOR DONALD TRUMP TO COME 

4483
03:02:38,914 --> 03:02:39,114
OUT. 

4484
03:02:39,114 --> 03:02:40,549
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SURREAL 

4485
03:02:40,549 --> 03:02:41,984
IMAGES WE'VE SEEN IN A VERY 

4486
03:02:41,984 --> 03:02:42,317
SURREAL DAY. 

4487
03:02:42,317 --> 03:02:43,619
>> I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE NO 

4488
03:02:43,619 --> 03:02:46,622
IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO PLAY OUT 

4489
03:02:46,622 --> 03:02:48,189
NEXT, BUT THE IDEA THAT AN 

4490
03:02:48,189 --> 03:02:49,425
AMERICAN PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW, 

4491
03:02:49,425 --> 03:02:50,726
HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE 

4492
03:02:50,726 --> 03:02:51,993
FLATTERED IN THIS VIDEO, AS 

4493
03:02:51,993 --> 03:02:53,429
YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE IMAGES 

4494
03:02:53,429 --> 03:02:54,029
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THAT 

4495
03:02:54,029 --> 03:02:55,397
VIDEO, BUT FOR AN AMERICAN 

4496
03:02:55,397 --> 03:03:00,002
PRESIDENT TO COME OUT TO A 

4497
03:03:00,002 --> 03:03:01,003
VIDEO LIKE THIS, WHICH IS 

4498
03:03:01,003 --> 03:03:01,603
BASICALLY ESSENTIALLY VETTING 

4499
03:03:01,603 --> 03:03:03,138
THE LEADERSHIP OF KIM JONG-UN, 

4500
03:03:03,138 --> 03:03:04,807
ONE OF THE MOST BRUTAL 

4501
03:03:04,807 --> 03:03:06,341
DICTATORS IN THE HISTORY OF THE 

4502
03:03:06,341 --> 03:03:07,843
WORLD, INCLUDING THE ENTIRE KIM 

4503
03:03:07,843 --> 03:03:10,145
FAMILY, HIS FATHER AND 

4504
03:03:10,145 --> 03:03:12,047
GRANDFATHER BEFORE HIM IS 

4505
03:03:12,047 --> 03:03:13,081
REMARKABLE INDEED. 

4506
03:03:13,081 --> 03:03:13,815
>> IT'S REALLY STRIKING. 

4507
03:03:13,815 --> 03:03:15,851
IT'S, AGAIN, ONE OF THOSE -- I 

4508
03:03:15,851 --> 03:03:16,818
FEEL THAT KIND OF SPEECHLESS 

4509
03:03:16,818 --> 03:03:20,022
WHERE I JUST WANT TO TRY TO 

4510
03:03:20,022 --> 03:03:22,424
TALK AND EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING 

4511
03:03:22,424 --> 03:03:22,724
ON HERE. 

4512
03:03:22,724 --> 03:03:23,592
IT'S REALLY, REALLY BIZARRE. 

4513
03:03:23,592 --> 03:03:25,460
AND ONE IMAGINES THAT AS PART 

4514
03:03:25,460 --> 03:03:26,228
OF THE NEGOTIATING, OKAY, KIM 

4515
03:03:26,228 --> 03:03:27,896
JONG-UN IS NOT GOING TO SHOW UP 

4516
03:03:27,896 --> 03:03:28,597
FOR THE PRESS CONFERENCE 

4517
03:03:28,597 --> 03:03:29,932
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE 

4518
03:03:29,932 --> 03:03:31,500
TO TAKE QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF 

4519
03:03:31,500 --> 03:03:33,101
THE AWFUL THINGS HE'S DONE AND 

4520
03:03:33,101 --> 03:03:34,203
JUST FRANKLY PROBABLY DOESN'T 

4521
03:03:34,203 --> 03:03:35,404
WANT TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AT 

4522
03:03:35,404 --> 03:03:37,606
ALL, AND INSTEAD THE NORTH 

4523
03:03:37,606 --> 03:03:40,042
KOREANS GET TO SHOW THIS VIDEO. 

4524
03:03:40,042 --> 03:03:42,410
>> AND THEY'RE REPLAYING IT. 

4525
03:03:42,410 --> 03:03:43,011
>> THEY'RE REPLAYING IT. 

4526
03:03:43,011 --> 03:03:43,278
>> YEAH. 

4527
03:03:43,278 --> 03:03:44,046
>> THEY'RE SHOWING PRESIDENT 

4528
03:03:44,046 --> 03:03:46,348
TRUMP AT THE UNITED NATIONS 

4529
03:03:46,348 --> 03:03:48,117
WHERE HE MADE THE COMMENTS TO 

4530
03:03:48,117 --> 03:03:52,221
LITTLE ROCKET MAN, AND THEN YOU 

4531
03:03:52,221 --> 03:03:54,423
SAW AN IMAGE OF CHAIRMAN KIM. 

4532
03:03:54,423 --> 03:03:56,725
OH, THEY'RE PLAYING IT IN 

4533
03:03:56,725 --> 03:03:58,527
ENGLISH. 

4534
03:03:58,527 --> 03:03:58,860
LET'S LISTEN. 

4535
03:03:58,860 --> 03:04:01,096
>> RELATIVE PEACE AND TIMES OF 

4536
03:04:01,096 --> 03:04:01,663
GREAT TENSION. 

4537
03:04:01,663 --> 03:04:03,699
WHILE THIS CYCLE REPEATS, THE 

4538
03:04:03,699 --> 03:04:05,066
LIGHT OF PROSPERITY AND 

4539
03:04:05,066 --> 03:04:08,604
INNOVATION HAS BURNED BRIGHT 

4540
03:04:08,604 --> 03:04:10,338
FOR MOST OF THE WORLD. 

4541
03:04:10,338 --> 03:04:11,707
HISTORY IS ALWAYS EVOLVING, AND 

4542
03:04:11,707 --> 03:04:14,843
THERE COMES A TIME WHEN ONLY A 

4543
03:04:14,843 --> 03:04:18,647
FEW ARE CALLED UPON TO MAKE A 

4544
03:04:18,647 --> 03:04:18,947
DIFFERENCE. 

4545
03:04:18,947 --> 03:04:21,450
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT 

4546
03:04:21,450 --> 03:04:22,951
DIFFERENCE WILL THE FEW MAKE? 

4547
03:04:22,951 --> 03:04:25,821
THE PAST DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE 

4548
03:04:25,821 --> 03:04:26,088
FUTURE. 

4549
03:04:26,088 --> 03:04:27,823
OUT OF THE DARKNESS CAN COME 

4550
03:04:27,823 --> 03:04:37,099
THE LIGHT, AND THE LIGHT OF 

4551
03:04:37,099 --> 03:04:38,267
HOPE CAN BURN BRIGHT. 

4552
03:04:38,267 --> 03:04:42,404
WHAT IF A PEOPLE THAT SHARE A 

4553
03:04:42,404 --> 03:04:45,340
COMMON AND RICH HERITAGE CAN 

4554
03:04:45,340 --> 03:04:46,574
FIND A COMMON FUTURE? 

4555
03:04:46,574 --> 03:04:54,850
THEIR STORY IS WELL KNOWN, BUT 

4556
03:04:54,850 --> 03:04:56,084
WHAT WILL BE THEIR SEQUEL? 

4557
03:04:56,084 --> 03:04:57,953
DESTINY PICTURES PRESENTS A 

4558
03:04:57,953 --> 03:05:01,356
STORY OF OPPORTUNITY, A NEW 

4559
03:05:01,356 --> 03:05:07,129
STORY, A NEW BEGINNING, ONE OF 

4560
03:05:07,129 --> 03:05:08,129
PEACE, TWO MEN, TWO LEADERS, 

4561
03:05:08,129 --> 03:05:10,365
ONE DESTINY, A STORY ABOUT A 

4562
03:05:10,365 --> 03:05:12,201
SPECIAL MOMENT IN TIME WHEN A 

4563
03:05:12,201 --> 03:05:16,705
MAN IS PRESENTED WITH ONE 

4564
03:05:16,705 --> 03:05:18,907
CHANCE THAT MAY NEVER BE 

4565
03:05:18,907 --> 03:05:19,174
REPEATED. 

4566
03:05:19,174 --> 03:05:29,484
WHAT WILL HE CHOOSE? 

4567
03:05:29,484 --> 03:05:31,520
TO SHOW VISION AND LEADERSHIP? 

4568
03:05:31,520 --> 03:05:31,753
OR NOT? 

4569
03:05:31,753 --> 03:05:38,259
THERE CAN ONLY BE TWO RESULTS, 

4570
03:05:38,259 --> 03:05:43,031
ONE OF MOVING BACK. 

4571
03:05:43,031 --> 03:05:51,239
[ EXPLOSION  ] [ JET ENGINE  ] 

4572
03:05:51,239 --> 03:05:51,739
>> OR ONE OF MOVING FORWARD. 

4573
03:05:59,981 --> 03:06:03,652
>> A NEW WORLD CAN BEGIN TODAY, 

4574
03:06:03,652 --> 03:06:06,154
ONE OF FRIENDSHIP, RESPECT AND 

4575
03:06:06,154 --> 03:06:06,454
GOOD WILL. 

4576
03:06:06,454 --> 03:06:08,657
BE PART OF THAT WORLD WHERE THE 

4577
03:06:08,657 --> 03:06:11,159
DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY ARE READY 

4578
03:06:11,159 --> 03:06:13,161
TO BE OPENED, INVESTMENT FROM 

4579
03:06:13,161 --> 03:06:16,398
AROUND THE WORLD WHERE YOU CAN 

4580
03:06:16,398 --> 03:06:18,000
HAVE MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGHS, AN 

4581
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:21,903
ABUNDANCE OF RESOURCES, 

4582
03:06:21,903 --> 03:06:23,571
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND NEW 

4583
03:06:23,571 --> 03:06:24,306
DISCOVERIES. 

4584
03:06:24,306 --> 03:06:24,573
WHAT IF? 

4585
03:06:24,573 --> 03:06:26,007
CAN HISTORY BE CHANGED? 

4586
03:06:26,007 --> 03:06:27,442
WILL THE WORLD EMBRACE THIS 

4587
03:06:27,442 --> 03:06:27,843
CHANGE? 

4588
03:06:27,843 --> 03:06:30,345
AND WHEN COULD THIS MOMENT IN 

4589
03:06:30,345 --> 03:06:31,679
HISTORY BEGIN? 

4590
03:06:31,679 --> 03:06:34,215
IT COMES DOWN TO A CHOICE. 

4591
03:06:34,215 --> 03:06:37,052
ON THIS DAY, IN THIS TIME, AT 

4592
03:06:37,052 --> 03:06:42,658
THIS MOMENT, THE WORLD WILL BE 

4593
03:06:42,658 --> 03:06:43,558
WATCHING, LISTENING, 

4594
03:06:43,558 --> 03:06:44,259
ANTICIPATING, HOPING. 

4595
03:06:44,259 --> 03:06:45,060
WILL THIS LEADER CHOOSE TO 

4596
03:06:45,060 --> 03:06:47,696
ADVANCE HIS COUNTRY AND BE PART 

4597
03:06:47,696 --> 03:06:49,931
OF A NEW WORLD? 

4598
03:06:49,931 --> 03:06:52,233
BE THE HERO OF HIS PEOPLE? 

4599
03:06:52,233 --> 03:06:55,937
WILL HE SHAKE THE HAND OF PEACE 

4600
03:06:55,937 --> 03:06:58,307
AND ENJOY PROSPERITY LIKE HE 

4601
03:06:58,307 --> 03:07:01,143
HAS NEVER SEEN? 

4602
03:07:01,143 --> 03:07:08,116
A GREAT LIFE OR MORE ISOLATION? 

4603
03:07:08,116 --> 03:07:09,951
WHICH PATH WILL BE CHOAZEN? 

4604
03:07:09,951 --> 03:07:12,654
FEATURING PRESIDENT DONALD 

4605
03:07:12,654 --> 03:07:15,590
TRUMP AND CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-UN.

>> THIS IS REMARKABLE. 

4607
03:07:16,758 --> 03:07:20,629
ISAAC, I'VE NEVER SEEN -- THIS 

4608
03:07:20,629 --> 03:07:24,032
IS UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAVE EVER 

4609
03:07:24,032 --> 03:07:24,565
SEEN BEFORE, BASICALLY A 

4610
03:07:24,565 --> 03:07:25,299
PROPAGADA VIDEO PRODUCED BY -- 

4611
03:07:25,299 --> 03:07:27,402
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE NORTH 

4612
03:07:27,402 --> 03:07:29,003
KOREANS OR THE SOUTH KOREANS. 

4613
03:07:29,003 --> 03:07:32,840
LOOKS LIKE IT'S THE NORTH 

4614
03:07:32,840 --> 03:07:34,008
KOREANS BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT 

4615
03:07:34,008 --> 03:07:35,243
-- AND HERE COMES THE PRESIDENT 

4616

03:07:59,201 --> 03:08:00,702
MONTHS, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE THIS 

4627

HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE A 

4628
03:08:01,903 --> 03:08:02,136
WHILE. 

4629
03:08:02,136 --> 03:08:05,740
THAT WAS A TAPE THAT WE GAVE TO

03:08:11,679 --> 03:08:12,948
COULD BE DONE, AND THAT'S A 

4634
03:08:12,948 --> 03:08:15,116
GREAT PLACE, HAS THE POTENTIAL 

4635
03:08:15,116 --> 03:08:17,452
TO BE AN INCREDIBLE PLACE 

4636
03:08:17,452 --> 03:08:19,254
BETWEEN SOUTH KOREA, IF YOU

AND A VERY SPECIAL PERSON, 

4681
03:09:52,981 --> 03:09:56,451
PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA WHO HAS 

4682
03:09:56,451 --> 03:09:57,752
REALLY CLOSED UP THAT BORDER, 

4683
03:09:57,752 --> 03:09:58,954
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LESS SO OVER 

4684
03:09:58,954 --> 03:10:01,256
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT 

4685
03:10:01,256 --> 03:10:01,589

03:10:15,504 --> 03:10:16,037
VERY HISTORIC DAY.

03:10:16,037 --> 03:10:17,405
MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WANT TO

03:10:17,405 --> 03:10:18,940

03:10:25,079 --> 03:10:29,016
MEETING, THE FIRST BETWEEN AN 

4699
03:10:29,016 --> 03:10:32,153
AMERICAN PRESIDENT AND A LEADER 

4700
03:10:32,153 --> 03:10:35,357
OF NORTH KOREA PROVES THAT REAL 

4701
03:10:35,357 --> 03:10:38,292
CHANGE IS INDEED POSSIBLE. 

4702
03:10:38,292 --> 03:10:39,694
MY MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN KIM 

4703
03:10:39,694 --> 03:10:40,862
WAS HONEST, DIRECT AND 

4704
03:10:40,862 --> 03:10:41,162
PRODUCTIVE. 

4705
03:10:41,162 --> 03:10:44,132
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER WELL 

4706
03:10:44,132 --> 03:10:48,236
IN A VERY CONFINED PERIOD OF 

4707
03:10:48,236 --> 03:10:50,639
TIME, UNDER VERY STRONG, STRONG 

4708
03:10:50,639 --> 03:10:50,972
CIRCUMSTANCE. 

4709
03:10:50,972 --> 03:10:52,240
WE'RE PREPARED TO START A NEW 

4710
03:10:52,240 --> 03:10:53,842
HISTORY, AND WE'RE READY TO 

4711
03:10:53,842 --> 03:10:56,845
WRITE A NEW CHAPTER BETWEEN OUR 

4712
03:10:56,845 --> 03:10:57,112
NATIONS. 

4713
03:10:57,112 --> 03:11:01,750
NEARLY 70 YEARS AGO, THINK OF 

4714
03:11:01,750 --> 03:11:06,154
THAT, 70 YEARS AGO AN EXTREMELY 

4715
03:11:06,154 --> 03:11:07,455
BLOODY CONFLICT RAVAGED THE 

4716
03:11:07,455 --> 03:11:08,156
KOREAN PENINSULA. 

4717
03:11:08,156 --> 03:11:10,458
COUNTLESS PEOPLE DIED IN THE 

4718
03:11:10,458 --> 03:11:12,794
CONFLICT, INCLUDING TENS OF 

4719
03:11:12,794 --> 03:11:14,529
THOUSANDS OF BRAVE AMERICANS, 

4720
03:11:14,529 --> 03:11:15,363
YET WHILE THE ARMISTICE WAS 

4721
03:11:15,363 --> 03:11:17,899
AGREED TO, THE WAR NEVER ENDED 

4722
03:11:17,899 --> 03:11:19,934
TO THIS DAY, NEVER ENDED. 

4723
03:11:19,934 --> 03:11:21,403
BUT NOW WE CAN ALL HAVE HOPE 

4724
03:11:21,403 --> 03:11:24,406
THAT IT WILL SOON END, AND IT 

4725
03:11:24,406 --> 03:11:26,941
WILL, IT WILL SOON END. 

4726
03:11:26,941 --> 03:11:29,444
THE PAST DOES NOT HAVE TO 

4727
03:11:29,444 --> 03:11:30,178
DEFINE THE FUTURE. 

4728
03:11:30,178 --> 03:11:33,348
YESTERDAY'S CONFLICT DOES NOT 

4729
03:11:33,348 --> 03:11:35,550
HAVE TO BE TOMORROW'S WAR. 

4730
03:11:35,550 --> 03:11:38,753
AND AS HISTORY HAS PROVEN OVER 

4731
03:11:38,753 --> 03:11:40,956
AND OVER AGAIN, ADVERSARIES CAN 

4732
03:11:40,956 --> 03:11:41,922
INDEED BECOME FRIENDS. 

4733
03:11:41,922 --> 03:11:43,959
WE CAN HONOR THE SACRIFICE OF 

4734
03:11:43,959 --> 03:11:46,861
OUR FOREFATHERS BY REPLACING 

4735
03:11:46,861 --> 03:11:49,264
THE HORRORS OF BATTLE WITH THE 

4736
03:11:49,264 --> 03:11:50,131
BLESSINGS OF PEACE, AND THAT'S 

4737
03:11:50,131 --> 03:11:52,434
WHAT WE'RE DOING, AND THAT'S 

4738
03:11:52,434 --> 03:11:53,201
WHAT WE HAVE DONE. 

4739
03:11:53,201 --> 03:11:55,537
THERE'S NO LIMIT TO WHAT NORTH 

4740
03:11:55,537 --> 03:12:00,442
KOREA CAN ACHIEVE WHEN IT GIVES 

4741
03:12:00,442 --> 03:12:02,109
UP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND 

4742
03:12:02,109 --> 03:12:03,144
EMBRACES COMMERCE, AN 

4743
03:12:03,144 --> 03:12:07,649
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE REST OF THE 

4744
03:12:07,649 --> 03:12:09,184
WORLD THAT REALLY WANTS TO 

4745
03:12:09,184 --> 03:12:09,417
ENGAGE. 

4746
03:12:09,417 --> 03:12:11,953
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS BEFORE HIM AN 

4747
03:12:11,953 --> 03:12:13,755
OPPORTUNITY LIKE NO OTHER TO BE 

4748
03:12:13,755 --> 03:12:16,558
REMEMBERED AS THE LEADER WHO 

4749
03:12:16,558 --> 03:12:20,662
USHERED IN A GLORIOUS NEW ERA 

4750
03:12:20,662 --> 03:12:22,030
OF SECURITY AND PROSPERITY FOR 

4751
03:12:22,030 --> 03:12:22,563
HIS PEOPLE. 

4752
03:12:22,563 --> 03:12:24,332
CHAIRMAN KIM AND I JUST SIGNED 

4753
03:12:24,332 --> 03:12:28,903
A JOINT STATEMENT IN WHICH HE 

4754
03:12:28,903 --> 03:12:32,040
REAFFIRMED HIS UNWAVERING 

4755
03:12:32,040 --> 03:12:34,608
COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE 

4756
03:12:34,608 --> 03:12:36,177
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 

4757
03:12:36,177 --> 03:12:36,477
PENINSULA. 

4758
03:12:36,477 --> 03:12:39,747
WE ALSO AGREED TO VIGOROUS 

4759
03:12:39,747 --> 03:12:40,347
NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE 

4760
03:12:40,347 --> 03:12:43,251
AGREEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, 

4761
03:12:43,251 --> 03:12:45,453
AND HE WANTS TO DO THAT. 

4762
03:12:45,453 --> 03:12:48,957
THIS ISN'T THE PAST, THIS ISN'T 

4763
03:12:48,957 --> 03:12:49,991
ANOTHER ADMINISTRATION THAT 

4764
03:12:49,991 --> 03:12:53,261
NEVER GOT IT STARTED AND 

4765
03:12:53,261 --> 03:12:54,962
THEREFORE NEVER GOT IT DONE. 

4766
03:12:54,962 --> 03:12:58,033
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS TOLD ME THAT 

4767
03:12:58,033 --> 03:13:01,836
NORTH KOREA IS ALREADY 

4768
03:13:01,836 --> 03:13:02,904
DESTROYING A MAJOR MISSILE 

4769
03:13:02,904 --> 03:13:04,806
ENGINE TESTING SITE, THAT'S NOT 

4770
03:13:04,806 --> 03:13:05,740
IN YOUR SIGNED AGREEMENT, WE 

4771
03:13:05,740 --> 03:13:10,378
AGREED TO THAT AFTER THE 

4772
03:13:10,378 --> 03:13:10,845
AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED. 

4773
03:13:10,845 --> 03:13:12,347
THAT'S A BIG THING FOR THE 

4774
03:13:12,347 --> 03:13:13,481
MISSILES THAT THEY WERE 

4775
03:13:13,481 --> 03:13:15,350
TESTING, SITE IS GOING TO BE 

4776
03:13:15,350 --> 03:13:17,452
DESTROYED VERY SOON. 

4777
03:13:17,452 --> 03:13:19,854
TODAY IS THE BEGINNING OF 

4778
03:13:19,854 --> 03:13:20,955
ANARDUOUS PROCESS, OUR EYES ARE 

4779
03:13:20,955 --> 03:13:24,359
WIDE OPEN, BUT PEACE IS ALWAYS 

4780
03:13:24,359 --> 03:13:25,760
WORTH THE EFFORT, ESPECIALLY IN 

4781
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:26,361
THIS CASE. 

4782
03:13:26,361 --> 03:13:27,762
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE 

4783
03:13:27,762 --> 03:13:31,232
YEARS AGO, THIS SHOULD HAVE 

4784
03:13:31,232 --> 03:13:33,401
BEEN RESOLVED A LONG TIME AGO. 

4785
03:13:33,401 --> 03:13:34,736
BUT WE'RE RESOLVING IT NOW. 

4786
03:13:34,736 --> 03:13:37,505
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS THE CHANCE TO 

4787
03:13:37,505 --> 03:13:40,275
SEIZE AN INCREDIBLE FUTURE FOR 

4788
03:13:40,275 --> 03:13:40,708
HIS PEOPLE. 

4789
03:13:40,708 --> 03:13:44,946
ANYONE CAN MAKE WAR, BUT ONLY 

4790
03:13:44,946 --> 03:13:46,948
THE MOST COURAGEOUS CAN MAKE 

4791
03:13:46,948 --> 03:13:47,181
PEACE. 

4792
03:13:47,181 --> 03:13:48,450
THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS 

4793
03:13:48,450 --> 03:13:50,552
CANNOT ENDURE FOREVER, THE 

4794
03:13:50,552 --> 03:13:55,457
PEOPLE OF KOREA, NORTH AND 

4795
03:13:55,457 --> 03:13:58,159
SOUTH ARE PROFOUNDLY TALENTED, 

4796
03:13:58,159 --> 03:13:59,661
INDUS TREOUS AND GIFTED. 

4797
03:13:59,661 --> 03:14:00,795
THESE ARE TRULY GIFTED PEOPLE. 

4798
03:14:00,795 --> 03:14:03,031
THEY SHARE THE SAME HERITAGE, 

4799
03:14:03,031 --> 03:14:05,433
LANGUAGE, CULTURE, CUSTOMS AND 

4800
03:14:05,433 --> 03:14:05,834
DESTINY. 

4801
03:14:05,834 --> 03:14:08,036
BUT TO REALIZE THEIR AMAZING 

4802
03:14:08,036 --> 03:14:09,437
DESTINY, TO REUNITE THEIR 

4803
03:14:09,437 --> 03:14:13,141
NATIONAL FAMILY, THE MENACE OF 

4804
03:14:13,141 --> 03:14:16,911
NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL NOW BE 

4805
03:14:16,911 --> 03:14:17,178
REMOVED. 

4806
03:14:17,178 --> 03:14:19,547
IN THE MEANTIME, THE SANCTIONS 

4807
03:14:19,547 --> 03:14:20,481
WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT. 

4808
03:14:20,481 --> 03:14:22,550
WE DREAM OF A FUTURE WHERE ALL 

4809
03:14:22,550 --> 03:14:24,052
KOREANS CAN LIVE TOGETHER IN 

4810
03:14:24,052 --> 03:14:27,188
HERMANY, WHERE FAMILIES ARE 

4811
03:14:27,188 --> 03:14:28,089
REUNITED AND HOPES ARE REBORN, 

4812
03:14:28,089 --> 03:14:30,458
AND WHERE THE LIGHT OF PEACE 

4813
03:14:30,458 --> 03:14:32,961
CHASES AWAY THE DARKNESS OF 

4814
03:14:32,961 --> 03:14:34,629
WAR, THIS BRIGHT FUTURE IS 

4815
03:14:34,629 --> 03:14:37,532
WITHIN IT AND THIS IS WHAT'S 

4816
03:14:37,532 --> 03:14:37,832
HAPPENING. 

4817
03:14:37,832 --> 03:14:39,734
IT IS RIGHT THERE, IT'S WITHIN 

4818
03:14:39,734 --> 03:14:40,368
OUR REACH. 

4819
03:14:40,368 --> 03:14:42,770
IT'S GOING TO BE THERE. 

4820
03:14:42,770 --> 03:14:44,072
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. 

4821
03:14:44,072 --> 03:14:47,075
PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS COULD NEVER 

4822
03:14:47,075 --> 03:14:47,408
TAKE PLACE. 

4823
03:14:47,408 --> 03:14:48,509
IT IS NOW TAKING PLACE. 

4824
03:14:48,509 --> 03:14:50,311
IT'S A VERY GREAT DAY, IT'S A 

4825
03:14:50,311 --> 03:14:54,349
VERY GREAT MOMENT IN THE 

4826
03:14:54,349 --> 03:14:56,451
HISTORY OF THE WORLD, AND 

4827
03:14:56,451 --> 03:14:57,952
CHAIRMAN KIM IS ON HIS WAY BACK 

4828
03:14:57,952 --> 03:14:59,154
TO NORTH KOREA, AND I KNOW FOR 

4829
03:14:59,154 --> 03:15:00,588
A FACT AS SOON AS HE ARRIVES 

4830
03:15:00,588 --> 03:15:01,956
HE'S GOING TO START A PROCESS

MAKES ME FEEL VERY 

4839
03:15:16,538 --> 03:15:16,905
UNCOMFORTABLE. 

4840
03:15:16,905 --> 03:15:18,772
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. 

4841
03:15:18,772 --> 03:15:20,175
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS 

4842
03:15:20,175 --> 03:15:21,776
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL 

4843
03:15:21,776 --> 03:15:22,710
OF US, INCLUDING YOURSELF AND 

4844
03:15:22,710 --> 03:15:23,077

SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

4847
03:15:27,148 --> 03:15:31,085
WE'LL TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. 

4848
03:15:31,085 --> 03:15:31,285
WOW! 

4849
03:15:31,285 --> 03:15:32,586
THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 

4850
03:15:32,586 --> 03:15:33,087
GO AHEAD. 

4851
03:15:33,087 --> 03:15:33,287

4854

>>REPORTER:  THANKS, MR. 

4855
03:15:34,288 --> 03:15:34,589
PRESIDENT. 

4856
03:15:34,589 --> 03:15:36,057
TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU, IF YOU 

4857
03:15:36,057 --> 03:15:36,558
DON'T MIND. 

4858
03:15:36,558 --> 03:15:38,359
FIRST, THE MAN YOU MET TODAY, 

4859
03:15:38,359 --> 03:15:40,561
KIM JONG-UN, AS YOU KNOW HAS 

4860
03:15:40,561 --> 03:15:44,632
KILLED FAMILY MEMBERS, HAS úSTA 

4861
03:15:44,632 --> 03:15:46,434
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF 

4862
03:15:46,434 --> 03:15:46,801
OTTO WARMBIER. 

4863
03:15:46,801 --> 03:15:49,237
WHY ARE YOU SO COMFORTABLE 

4864
03:15:49,237 --> 03:15:50,704
CALLING HIM VERY TALENTED? 

4865
03:15:50,704 --> 03:15:52,740
>> WELL, HE IS VERY TALENTED. 

4866
03:15:52,740 --> 03:15:54,542
ANYBODY THAT TAKES OVER A 

4867
03:15:54,542 --> 03:15:57,078
SITUATION LIKE HE DID AT 26 

4868
03:15:57,078 --> 03:16:02,984
YEARS OF AGE AND IS ABLE TO RUN 

4869
03:16:02,984 --> 03:16:04,219
IT AND RUN IT TOUGH, I DON'T 

4870
03:16:04,219 --> 03:16:07,055
SAY HE WAS NICE, OR I DON'T SAY 

4871
03:16:07,055 --> 03:16:09,357
ANYTHING ABOUT IT, BUT VERY FEW 

4872
03:16:09,357 --> 03:16:10,959
PEOPLE AT THAT AGE -- YOU COULD 

4873
03:16:10,959 --> 03:16:14,062
TAKE ONE OUT OF 10,000 PROBABLY 

4874
03:16:14,062 --> 03:16:15,195
COULDN'T DO IT. 

4875
03:16:15,195 --> 03:16:16,130
OTTO WARMBIER IS A VERY SPECIAL 

4876
03:16:16,130 --> 03:16:18,132
PERSON, AND HE WILL BE FOR A 

4877
03:16:18,132 --> 03:16:19,033
LONG TIME IN MY LIFE. 

4878
03:16:19,033 --> 03:16:21,436
HIS PARENTS ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF 

4879
03:16:21,436 --> 03:16:22,537
MINE. 

4880
03:16:22,537 --> 03:16:25,873
I THINK WITHOUT OTTO THIS WOULD 

4881
03:16:25,873 --> 03:16:26,607
NOT HAVE HAPPENED. 

4882
03:16:26,607 --> 03:16:27,375
SOMETHING HAPPENED FROM THAT 

4883
03:16:27,375 --> 03:16:27,575
DAY. 

4884
03:16:27,575 --> 03:16:29,978
IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING, IT WAS 

4885
03:16:29,978 --> 03:16:31,779
BRUTAL, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE 

4886
03:16:31,779 --> 03:16:37,685
STARTED TO FOCUS ON WHAT WAS 

4887
03:16:37,685 --> 03:16:38,419
GOING ON, INCLUDING NORTH 

4888
03:16:38,419 --> 03:16:38,652
KOREA. 

4889
03:16:38,652 --> 03:16:40,054
I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 

4890
03:16:40,054 --> 03:16:43,358
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN 

4891
03:16:43,358 --> 03:16:43,558
VAIN. 

4892
03:16:43,558 --> 03:16:45,426
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS. 

4893
03:16:45,426 --> 03:16:47,862
A SPECIAL YOUNG MAN. 

4894
03:16:47,862 --> 03:16:49,663
AND I HAVE TO SAY SPECIAL 

4895
03:16:49,663 --> 03:16:50,464
PARENTS, SPECIAL PEOPLE. 

4896
03:16:50,464 --> 03:16:51,733
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN. 

4897
03:16:51,733 --> 03:16:53,534
HE A LOT TO DO WITH US BEING 

4898
03:16:53,534 --> 03:16:53,834
HERE TODAY. 

4899
03:16:53,834 --> 03:16:54,334
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

4900
03:16:54,334 --> 03:16:55,670
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, 

4901
03:16:55,670 --> 03:16:56,737
THAT SECOND QUESTION FOR YOU, 

4902
03:16:56,737 --> 03:16:58,172
SIR, IS ON THE SECURITY -- 

4903
03:16:58,172 --> 03:16:59,340
SECOND QUESTION IS ON THE 

4904
03:16:59,340 --> 03:17:00,775
SECURITY ASSURANCES YOU TALKED 

4905
03:17:00,775 --> 03:17:02,777
ABOUT IN YOUR STATEMENT. 

4906
03:17:02,777 --> 03:17:03,678
CAN YOU BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT 

4907
03:17:03,678 --> 03:17:06,080
ASSURANCES YOU ARE WILLING TO 

4908
03:17:06,080 --> 03:17:07,848
GIVE TO KIM JONG-UN? 

4909
03:17:07,848 --> 03:17:09,016
DOES THAT INCLUDE REDUCING 

4910
03:17:09,016 --> 03:17:09,517
MILITARY CAPABILITIES? 

4911
03:17:09,517 --> 03:17:11,085
AND JUST TO FL FOLLOW UP ON 

4912
03:17:11,085 --> 03:17:12,219
YOUR ANSWER -- 

4913
03:17:12,219 --> 03:17:12,853
>> NO, WE'RE NOT REDUCING 

4914
03:17:12,853 --> 03:17:13,120
ANYTHING. 

4915
03:17:13,120 --> 03:17:13,988
AT SOME POINT I HAVE TO BE 

4916
03:17:13,988 --> 03:17:16,357
HONEST AND I USED TO SAY THIS 

4917
03:17:16,357 --> 03:17:17,558
DURING MY CAMPAIGN, AS YOU KNOW 

4918
03:17:17,558 --> 03:17:18,760
PROBABLY BETTER THAN MOST, I 

4919
03:17:18,760 --> 03:17:20,028
WANT TO GET OUR SOLDIERS OUT. 

4920
03:17:20,028 --> 03:17:23,932
I WANT TO BRING OUR SOLDIERS 

4921
03:17:23,932 --> 03:17:24,732
BACK HOME. 

4922
03:17:24,732 --> 03:17:25,766
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 32,000 

4923
03:17:25,766 --> 03:17:26,634
SOLDIERS IN SOUTH KOREA, AND 

4924
03:17:26,634 --> 03:17:28,536
I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BRING 

4925
03:17:28,536 --> 03:17:29,237
THEM BACK HOME. 

4926
03:17:29,237 --> 03:17:31,039
BUT THAT'S NOT PART OF THE 

4927
03:17:31,039 --> 03:17:31,506
EQUATION RIGHT NOW. 

4928
03:17:31,506 --> 03:17:34,042
AT SOME POINT I HOPE IT WILL 

4929
03:17:34,042 --> 03:17:34,675
BE, BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. 

4930
03:17:34,675 --> 03:17:35,944
WE WILL BE STOPPING THE WAR 

4931
03:17:35,944 --> 03:17:38,880
GAMES WHICH WILL SAVE US A 

4932
03:17:38,880 --> 03:17:43,251
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY, 

4933
03:17:43,251 --> 03:17:45,219
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE 

4934
03:17:45,219 --> 03:17:47,055
FUTURE NEGOTIATION IS NOT GOING 

4935
03:17:47,055 --> 03:17:48,556
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD, BUT WE'LL 

4936
03:17:48,556 --> 03:17:51,960
BE SAVING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 

4937
03:17:51,960 --> 03:17:59,133
OF MONEY, PLUS I THINK IT'S 

4938
03:17:59,133 --> 03:17:59,767
VERY PROVOCATIVE. 

4939
03:17:59,767 --> 03:18:00,234
YES, JOHN. 

4940
03:18:00,234 --> 03:18:01,168
YES, JOHN, GO AHEAD. 

4941
03:18:01,168 --> 03:18:01,335
OH.

GO AHEAD. 

4943
03:18:01,602 --> 03:18:01,969
I'M SORRY. 

4944
03:18:01,969 --> 03:18:04,739
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOHN

ROBERTS. 

4946
03:18:05,139 --> 03:18:05,840
I LOOKED AT YOU. 

4947
03:18:05,840 --> 03:18:08,142
YOU LOOK MUCH BETTER, RIGHT? 

4948

>>REPORTER:  WE'RE FREQUENTLY 

4949
03:18:09,911 --> 03:18:10,545
CONFUSED, MR. PRESIDENT. 

4950
03:18:10,545 --> 03:18:12,947
MR. PRESIDENT, THIS JOINT 

4951
03:18:12,947 --> 03:18:15,249
STATEMENT DOES NOT TALK ABOUT 

4952
03:18:15,249 --> 03:18:15,984
VERIFIABLE OR IRREVERSIBLE 

4953
03:18:15,984 --> 03:18:16,651
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

4954
03:18:16,651 --> 03:18:16,918

UNITED STATES? 

4958
03:18:20,221 --> 03:18:20,955
>> NO, NOT AT ALL. 

4959
03:18:20,955 --> 03:18:22,957
IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT SAID WE 

4960
03:18:22,957 --> 03:18:25,827

IT WILL BE GONE -- I DON'T 

4962

03:19:40,534 --> 03:19:41,936
>>REPORTER:  I'LL BE VERY 

5012
03:19:41,936 --> 03:19:42,336
RESPECTFUL, SIR. 

5013
03:19:42,336 --> 03:19:46,073
WHAT DID KIM JONG-UN SAY TO YOU 

5014
03:19:46,073 --> 03:19:47,375
TO GIVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE THAT 

5015
03:19:47,375 --> 03:19:49,777
FOR ONCE IN THE HISTORY OF 

5016
03:19:49,777 --> 03:19:50,745
NORTH KOREA THEY ARE NOT 

5017
03:19:50,745 --> 03:19:52,980
CHEATING THE SYSTEM AND GAMING 

5018
03:19:52,980 --> 03:19:54,282
THE WORLD AND GAMING THE PEOPLE 

5019
03:19:54,282 --> 03:19:56,884
WHO WILL HAVE TO GO IN AND MAKE 

5020
03:19:56,884 --> 03:19:58,886
SURE THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY 

5021
03:19:58,886 --> 03:20:00,187
GIVING UP THEIR NUCLEAR 

5022
03:20:00,187 --> 03:20:00,555
ARSENAL? 

5023
03:20:00,555 --> 03:20:01,589
>>REPORTER:  VERY FAIR 

5024
03:20:01,589 --> 03:20:01,856
QUESTION. 

5025
03:20:01,856 --> 03:20:03,357
HE ACTUALLY MENTIONED THE FACT 

5026
03:20:03,357 --> 03:20:05,159
THAT THEY PROCEEDED DOWN A PATH 

5027
03:20:05,159 --> 03:20:07,261
IN THE PAST AND ULTIMATELY, AS 

5028
03:20:07,261 --> 03:20:08,062
YOU KNOW, NOTHING GOT DONE. 

5029
03:20:08,062 --> 03:20:11,999
IN ONE CASE THEY TOOK BILLIONS 

5030
03:20:11,999 --> 03:20:14,535
OF DOLLARS DURING THE CLINTON 

5031
03:20:14,535 --> 03:20:15,837
REGIME, TOOK BILLIONS OF 

5032
03:20:15,837 --> 03:20:17,838
DOLLARS AND NOTHING HAPPENED. 

5033
03:20:17,838 --> 03:20:18,472
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE THING. 

5034
03:20:18,472 --> 03:20:20,374
AND HE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT UP 

5035
03:20:20,374 --> 03:20:22,810
TO ME, AND HE SAID WE HAVE 

5036
03:20:22,810 --> 03:20:25,179
NEVER GONE THIS FAR, I DON'T 

5037
03:20:25,179 --> 03:20:25,980
THINK THEY'VE EVER HAD THE 

5038
03:20:25,980 --> 03:20:26,881
CONFIDENCE, FRANKLY, IN A 

5039
03:20:26,881 --> 03:20:27,949
PRESIDENT THAT THEY HAVE RIGHT 

5040
03:20:27,949 --> 03:20:31,686
NOW FOR GETTING THINGS DONE AND 

5041
03:20:31,686 --> 03:20:32,587
HAVING THE ABILITY TO GET 

5042
03:20:32,587 --> 03:20:32,920
THINGS DONE. 

5043
03:20:32,920 --> 03:20:35,456
AND HE WAS VERY FIRM IN THE 

5044
03:20:35,456 --> 03:20:36,657
FACT THAT HE WANTS TO DO THIS 

5045
03:20:36,657 --> 03:20:38,993
-- I THINK HE MIGHT WANT TO DO 

5046
03:20:38,993 --> 03:20:40,694
THIS AS MUCH OR EVEN MORE THAN 

5047
03:20:40,694 --> 03:20:44,031
ME BECAUSE THEY SEE A VERY 

5048
03:20:44,031 --> 03:20:45,800
BRIGHT FUTURE FOR NORTH KOREA. 

5049
03:20:45,800 --> 03:20:46,967
SO YOU NEVER KNOW, RIGHT? 

5050
03:20:46,967 --> 03:20:47,435
WE NEVER KNOW. 

5051
03:20:47,435 --> 03:20:49,870
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, WE SIGNED 

5052
03:20:49,870 --> 03:20:50,504
A VERY COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT 

5053
03:20:50,504 --> 03:20:53,274
TODAY, AND I THINK MOST OF YOU 

5054
03:20:53,274 --> 03:20:55,942
HAVE BEEN GIVEN THAT DOCUMENT. 

5055
03:20:55,942 --> 03:20:57,078
BUT WE SIGNED A VERY, VERY 

5056
03:20:57,078 --> 03:20:57,778
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, AND I 

5057
03:20:57,778 --> 03:20:59,580
BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO LIVE UP 

5058
03:20:59,580 --> 03:21:00,047
TO THAT DOCUMENT. 

5059
03:21:00,047 --> 03:21:01,449
IN FACT, WEN HE LANDS WHICH IS 

5060
03:21:01,449 --> 03:21:03,251
GOING TO BE SHORTLY, I THINK 

5061
03:21:03,251 --> 03:21:06,053
THAT HE WILL START THAT PROCESS 

5062
03:21:06,053 --> 03:21:06,454
RIGHT AWAY. 

5063
03:21:06,454 --> 03:21:06,954
I DO. 

5064
03:21:06,954 --> 03:21:11,959
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I KNOW HIM 

5065
03:21:11,959 --> 03:21:14,262
FOR -- REALLY WELL, IT'S BEEN 

5066
03:21:14,262 --> 03:21:15,930
VERY RHETORICAL, AS YOU KNOW. 

5067
03:21:15,930 --> 03:21:18,032
I THINK WITHOUT THE RHETORIC IT 

5068
03:21:18,032 --> 03:21:18,799
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. 

5069
03:21:18,799 --> 03:21:20,334
I THINK WITHOUT OTHER THINGS 

5070
03:21:20,334 --> 03:21:23,237
GOING ALONG, I THINK THE 

5071
03:21:23,237 --> 03:21:25,740
ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW TEAM WAS 

5072
03:21:25,740 --> 03:21:26,473
VERY IMPORTANT. 

5073
03:21:26,473 --> 03:21:26,974
WE HAVE A GREAT TEAM. 

5074
03:21:26,974 --> 03:21:28,776
BUT I DO, I THINK HE WANTS TO 

5075
03:21:28,776 --> 03:21:30,278
GET IT DONE. 

5076
03:21:30,278 --> 03:21:32,280
I REALLY FEEL THAT VERY 

5077
03:21:32,280 --> 03:21:32,547
STRONGLY. 

5078
03:21:32,547 --> 03:21:32,880
THERE'S JOHN. 

5079
03:21:32,880 --> 03:21:34,849
YOU KNOW, YOU TWO GUYS LOOK 

5080
03:21:34,849 --> 03:21:37,318
ALIKE WHEN THE LIGHT IS RIGHT. 

5081
03:21:37,318 --> 03:21:38,952
THE HAIR IS VERY SIMILAR. 

5082
03:21:38,952 --> 03:21:39,253
LET'S SEE. 

5083
03:21:39,253 --> 03:21:39,854
WHO HAS BETTER HAIR? 

5084
03:21:39,854 --> 03:21:41,055
HE HAS PRETTY GOOD HAIR, JOHN. 

5085
03:21:41,055 --> 03:21:43,123
>>REPORTER:  IT'S THE ANGELIC 

5086
03:21:43,123 --> 03:21:44,392
GLOW OF THE BACK LIGHTING, MR. 

5087
03:21:44,392 --> 03:21:49,330
PRESIDENT THAT MAKES US LOOK SO 

5088
03:21:49,330 --> 03:21:49,597
SIMILAR. 

5089
03:21:49,597 --> 03:21:50,531
OF COURSE THE DENUCLEARIZATION, 

5090
03:21:50,531 --> 03:21:51,532
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND BIOLOGICAL 

5091
03:21:51,532 --> 03:21:53,334
WEAPONS AND WHATNOT IS ONE 

5092
03:21:53,334 --> 03:21:54,035
PROBLEM IN NORTH KOREA. 

5093
03:21:54,035 --> 03:21:54,835
ANOTHER HUGE PROBLEM IS THE 

5094
03:21:54,835 --> 03:21:58,239
HORRIBLE RECORD THAT THEY HAVE 

5095
03:21:58,239 --> 03:21:58,772
ON HUMAN RIGHTS. 

5096
03:21:58,772 --> 03:21:59,440
WAS THAT DISCUSSED AT ALL? 

5097
03:21:59,440 --> 03:22:01,075
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL 

5098
03:22:01,075 --> 03:22:04,311
TACKLE IN THE FUTURE? 

5099
03:22:04,311 --> 03:22:05,279
>> YES, IT WAS DISCUSSED. 

5100
03:22:05,279 --> 03:22:07,982
IT WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THE 

5101
03:22:07,982 --> 03:22:08,615
FUTURE, HUMAN RIGHTS. 

5102
03:22:08,615 --> 03:22:11,886
WHAT WAS ALSO DISCUSSED IN 

5103
03:22:11,886 --> 03:22:12,753
GREAT DETAIL, JOHN, WAS THE 

5104
03:22:12,753 --> 03:22:17,391
FACT THAT, YOU KNOW -- AND I 

5105
03:22:17,391 --> 03:22:19,226
MUST HAVE HAD JUST COUNTLESS 

5106
03:22:19,226 --> 03:22:20,194
CALLS AND LETTERS AND PLEASE, 

5107
03:22:20,194 --> 03:22:22,029
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO, THEY WANT 

5108
03:22:22,029 --> 03:22:23,230
THE REMAINS OF THEIR SONS BACK. 

5109
03:22:23,230 --> 03:22:24,432
THEY WANT THE REMAINS OF THEIR 

5110
03:22:24,432 --> 03:22:27,935
FATHERS AND MOTHERS AND ALL OF 

5111
03:22:27,935 --> 03:22:31,239
THE PEOPLE THAT GOT CAUGHT IN 

5112
03:22:31,239 --> 03:22:32,840
THAT REALLY BRUTAL WAR WHICH 

5113
03:22:32,840 --> 03:22:36,477
TOOK PLACE TO A LARGE EXTENT IN 

5114
03:22:36,477 --> 03:22:38,379
NORTH KOREA, AND I ASKED FOR IT 

5115
03:22:38,379 --> 03:22:40,046
TODAY, AND WE GOT IT. 

5116
03:22:40,046 --> 03:22:41,682
THAT WAS A VERY LAST MINUTE, 

5117
03:22:41,682 --> 03:22:43,317
THE REMAINS WILL BE COMING 

5118
03:22:43,317 --> 03:22:43,517
BACK. 

5119
03:22:43,517 --> 03:22:45,486
THEY'RE GOING TO START THAT 

5120
03:22:45,486 --> 03:22:45,953
PROCESS IMMEDIATELY. 

5121
03:22:45,953 --> 03:22:47,255
BUT SO MANY PEOPLE, EVEN DURING 

5122
03:22:47,255 --> 03:22:49,056
THE CAMPAIGN, THEY'D SAY IS 

5123
03:22:49,056 --> 03:22:52,159
THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN WORK WITH 

5124
03:22:52,159 --> 03:22:54,395
NORTH KOREA TO GET THE REMAINS 

5125
03:22:54,395 --> 03:22:56,230
OF MY SON BACK OR MY FATHER 

5126
03:22:56,230 --> 03:22:58,833
BACK, SO MANY PEOPLE ASK ME 

5127
03:22:58,833 --> 03:22:59,200
THIS QUESTION. 

5128
03:22:59,200 --> 03:23:01,135
AND, YOU KNOW, I SAID, LOOK, WE 

5129
03:23:01,135 --> 03:23:03,437
DON'T GET ALONG TOO WELL WITH 

5130
03:23:03,437 --> 03:23:04,939
THAT PARTICULAR GROUP OF 

5131
03:23:04,939 --> 03:23:05,339
PEOPLE. 

5132
03:23:05,339 --> 03:23:05,806
BUT NOW WE DO. 

5133
03:23:05,806 --> 03:23:07,575
AND HE AGREED TO THAT SO 

5134
03:23:07,575 --> 03:23:09,076
QUICKLY AND SO NICE -- IT WAS 

5135
03:23:09,076 --> 03:23:14,081
REALLY A VERY NICE THING, AND 

5136
03:23:14,081 --> 03:23:14,949
HE UNDERSTANDS IT. 

5137
03:23:14,949 --> 03:23:15,550
HE UNDERSTANDS IT. 

5138
03:23:15,550 --> 03:23:16,584
SO FOR THE THOUSANDS AND 

5139
03:23:16,584 --> 03:23:17,785
THOUSANDS, I GUESS WAY OVER 

5140
03:23:17,785 --> 03:23:22,757
6,000 THAT WE KNOW OF IN TERMS 

5141
03:23:22,757 --> 03:23:25,359
OF THE REMAINS, THEY'LL BE 

5142
03:23:25,359 --> 03:23:25,693
BROUGHT BACK. 

5143
03:23:25,693 --> 03:23:26,594
>>REPORTER:  THE POW/MIA ISSUE 

5144
03:23:26,594 --> 03:23:28,195
IS CLEARLY A VERY IMPORTANT ONE 

5145
03:23:28,195 --> 03:23:28,829
TO THOUSANDS. 

5146
03:23:28,829 --> 03:23:30,097
>> ESPECIALLY TO A LOT OF 

5147
03:23:30,097 --> 03:23:30,331
PEOPLE. 

5148
03:23:30,331 --> 03:23:32,333
>>REPORTER:  BUT WHAT DO YOU, 

5149
03:23:32,333 --> 03:23:33,834
PRESIDENT TRUMP, EXPECT KIM 

5150
03:23:33,834 --> 03:23:37,838
JONG-UN TO DO ABOUT THE HUMAN 

5151
03:23:37,838 --> 03:23:38,705
RIGHTS RECORD REGARDING THE 

5152
03:23:38,705 --> 03:23:39,606
NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE? 

5153
03:23:39,606 --> 03:23:40,106
>> RIGHT. 

5154
03:23:40,106 --> 03:23:43,778
IT WAS DISCUSSED, IT WAS 

5155
03:23:43,778 --> 03:23:44,378
DISCUSSED RELATIVELY BRIEFLY 

5156
03:23:44,378 --> 03:23:45,379
COMPARED TO DENUCLEARIZATION, 

5157
03:23:45,379 --> 03:23:46,646
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHERE WE 

5158
03:23:46,646 --> 03:23:49,116
STARTED AND WHERE WE ENDED. 

5159
03:23:49,116 --> 03:23:49,883
BUT THEY WILL BE DOING THINGS, 

5160
03:23:49,883 --> 03:23:52,386
AND I THINK HE WANTS TO DO 

5161
03:23:52,386 --> 03:23:52,787
THINGS. 

5162
03:23:52,787 --> 03:23:53,954
I THINK HE WANTS TO. 

5163
03:23:53,954 --> 03:23:56,890
YOU'D BE VERY SURPRISED, VERY 

5164
03:23:56,890 --> 03:23:57,992
SMART, VERY GOOD NEGOTIATOR, 

5165
03:23:57,992 --> 03:23:59,026
WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING. 

5166
03:23:59,026 --> 03:24:03,731
YOU KNOW, HE BROUGHT UP THE 

5167
03:24:03,731 --> 03:24:05,533
FACT THAT IN THE PAST THEY TOOK 

5168
03:24:05,533 --> 03:24:07,835
DIALOGUE -- THEY NEVER WERE 

5169
03:24:07,835 --> 03:24:08,436
LIKE WE ARE. 

5170
03:24:08,436 --> 03:24:09,336
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING 

5171
03:24:09,336 --> 03:24:10,438
LIKE WHAT'S TAKEN PLACE NOW. 

5172
03:24:10,438 --> 03:24:12,540
BUT THEY WENT DOWN THE LINE, 

5173
03:24:12,540 --> 03:24:14,875
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE GIVEN, 

5174
03:24:14,875 --> 03:24:18,279
AND, YOU KNOW, THE FOLLOWING 

5175
03:24:18,279 --> 03:24:18,946
DAY THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM 

5176
03:24:18,946 --> 03:24:19,246
CONTINUED. 

5177
03:24:19,246 --> 03:24:20,714
BUT THIS IS A MUCH DIFFERENT 

5178
03:24:20,714 --> 03:24:20,915
TIME. 

5179
03:24:20,915 --> 03:24:22,383
AND THIS IS A MUCH DIFFERENT 

5180
03:24:22,383 --> 03:24:24,417
PRESIDENT IN ALL FAIRNESS. 

5181
03:24:24,417 --> 03:24:25,352
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. 

5182
03:24:25,352 --> 03:24:28,055
THIS WAS ONE OF THE -- PERHAPS 

5183
03:24:28,055 --> 03:24:29,056
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I WON 

5184
03:24:29,056 --> 03:24:32,626
-- I CAMPAIGNED ON THIS ISSUE, 

5185
03:24:32,626 --> 03:24:34,061
AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL, JOHN. 

5186
03:24:34,061 --> 03:24:34,261
OKAY. 

5187
03:24:34,261 --> 03:24:34,995
WHOEVER THOSE PEOPLE ARE, I 

5188
03:24:34,995 --> 03:24:36,997
CANNOT SEE YOU WITH ALL THE 

5189
03:24:36,997 --> 03:24:38,733
LIGHTS, BUT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE 

5190
03:24:38,733 --> 03:24:42,002
EITHER OF THE TWO -- GO AHEAD. 

5191
03:24:42,002 --> 03:24:42,202
SURE. 

5192
03:24:42,202 --> 03:24:42,469
GO AHEAD. 

5193
03:24:42,469 --> 03:24:43,036
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 

5194
03:24:43,036 --> 03:24:43,336
PRESIDENT. 

5195
03:24:43,336 --> 03:24:44,238
AND FIRST OF ALL 

5196
03:24:44,238 --> 03:24:44,638
CONGRATULATIONS. 

5197
03:24:44,638 --> 03:24:45,339
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

5198
03:24:45,339 --> 03:24:45,706
APPRECIATE IT. 

5199
03:24:45,706 --> 03:24:50,711
>>REPORTER:  DID YOU TOUCH ON 

5200
03:24:50,711 --> 03:24:52,713
THE ISSUE OF PEACE TREATY, AND 

5201
03:24:52,713 --> 03:24:54,081
ALSO WILL YOU TRAVEL TO 

5202
03:24:54,081 --> 03:24:54,581
PYONGYANG ANYTIME SOON? 

5203
03:24:54,581 --> 03:24:56,317
>> WELL, AT A CERTAIN TIME I 

5204
03:24:56,317 --> 03:24:56,517
WILL. 

5205
03:24:56,517 --> 03:24:57,551
THAT WILL BE A DAY THAT I LOOK 

5206
03:24:57,551 --> 03:25:02,823
VERY MUCH FORWARD TO, AT THE 

5207
03:25:02,823 --> 03:25:03,223
APPROPRIATE TIME. 

5208
03:25:03,223 --> 03:25:03,991
AND I ALSO WILL BE INVITING 

5209
03:25:03,991 --> 03:25:04,992
CHAIRMAN KIM AT THE APPROPRIATE 

5210
03:25:04,992 --> 03:25:05,926
TIME TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 

5211
03:25:05,926 --> 03:25:10,765
I THINK IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE 

5212
03:25:10,765 --> 03:25:12,600
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE VERY 

5213
03:25:12,600 --> 03:25:15,769
IMPORTANT, AND HE HAS ACCEPTED. 

5214
03:25:15,769 --> 03:25:16,403
I SAID AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. 

5215
03:25:16,403 --> 03:25:16,971
WE WANT TO GO A LITTLE BIT 

5216
03:25:16,971 --> 03:25:18,973
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. 

5217
03:25:18,973 --> 03:25:21,308
BUT WHAT WE SIGNED TODAY WAS A 

5218
03:25:21,308 --> 03:25:22,475
LOT OF THINGS INCLUDED. 

5219
03:25:22,475 --> 03:25:23,811
AND THEN YOU HAVE THINGS THAT 

5220
03:25:23,811 --> 03:25:25,613
WEREN'T INCLUDED THAT WE GOT 

5221
03:25:25,613 --> 03:25:27,047
AFTER THE DEAL WAS SIGNED. 

5222
03:25:27,047 --> 03:25:28,549
I'VE DONE THAT BEFORE IN MY 

5223
03:25:28,549 --> 03:25:30,117
LIFE, AND WE DIDN'T PUT IT IN 

5224
03:25:30,117 --> 03:25:31,318
THE AGREEMENT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T 

5225
03:25:31,318 --> 03:25:31,618
HAVE TIME. 

5226
03:25:31,618 --> 03:25:35,089
AND I THINK MOST OF YOU HAVE 

5227
03:25:35,089 --> 03:25:37,792
BEEN HANDED OUT THE AGREEMENT 

5228
03:25:37,792 --> 03:25:38,159
OR SOON WILL. 

5229
03:25:38,159 --> 03:25:39,026
OH, YOU HAVE NOT? 

5230
03:25:39,026 --> 03:25:40,761
WELL, IF YOU COULD HAVE THOSE 

5231
03:25:40,761 --> 03:25:41,295
AGREEMENTS PASSED OUT. 

5232
03:25:41,295 --> 03:25:42,797
WE JUST FINISHED THEM JUST A 

5233
03:25:42,797 --> 03:25:43,364
LITTLE WHILE AGO. 

5234
03:25:43,364 --> 03:25:45,099
BUT IF YOU COULD HAVE THE 

5235
03:25:45,099 --> 03:25:46,367
AGREEMENTS PASSED OUT, YOU'LL 

5236
03:25:46,367 --> 03:25:50,738
SEE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. 

5237
03:25:50,738 --> 03:25:51,805
YES, SIR, GO AHEAD. 

5238
03:25:51,805 --> 03:25:52,773
>>REPORTER:  CONGRATULATIONS,

ABDUCTION ISSUE COME UP? 

5244
03:25:59,479 --> 03:25:59,914
>> YES. 

5245
03:25:59,914 --> 03:26:02,616
>>REPORTER:  AND ALSO THE FATE 

5246
03:26:02,616 --> 03:26:03,116

5247
03:26:03,116 --> 03:26:04,084
AND ALSO, A FOLLOWUP QUESTION 

5248
03:26:04,084 --> 03:26:07,721
IS WHEN WILL YOU BE DOING AN 

5249
03:26:07,721 --> 03:26:08,755
INTERVIEW WITH JAPANESE TV? 

5250
03:26:08,755 --> 03:26:12,293
50,000 TROOPS ARE IN JAPAN. 

5251
03:26:12,293 --> 03:26:13,694
>> THAT'S TRUE. 

5252
03:26:13,694 --> 03:26:14,794
50,000 GREAT TROOPS, THAT'S 

5253
03:26:14,794 --> 03:26:14,995
TRUE. 

5254
03:26:14,995 --> 03:26:15,495
ABDUCTION, ABSOLUTELY. 

5255
03:26:15,495 --> 03:26:17,498
PRIME MINISTER ABE, ONE OF HIS 

5256
03:26:17,498 --> 03:26:19,500
CERTAINLY -- OTHER THAN THE 

5257
03:26:19,500 --> 03:26:20,868
WHOLE DENUKING SUBJECT, 

5258
03:26:20,868 --> 03:26:21,902

5259
03:26:21,902 --> 03:26:23,303
HIS MAIN POINT, AND I BROUGHT 

5260
03:26:23,303 --> 03:26:24,672
IT UP, ABSOLUTELY, AND THEY'RE 

5261
03:26:24,672 --> 03:26:25,773
GOING TO BE WORKING ON THAT. 

5262
03:26:25,773 --> 03:26:29,210
WE DIDN'T PUT IT DOWN IN THE 

5263
03:26:29,210 --> 03:26:32,746
DOCUMENT, BUT IT WILL BE WORKED 

5264
03:26:32,746 --> 03:26:32,913
ON. 

5265
03:26:32,913 --> 03:26:36,116
CHRISTIANS, YES, WE ARE -- 

5266
03:26:36,116 --> 03:26:37,684
BROUGHT IT UP, VERY STRONGLY. 

5267
03:26:37,684 --> 03:26:38,552
YOU KNOW, FRANKLIN GRAHAM SPENT 

5268
03:26:38,552 --> 03:26:39,820
AND SPENDS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 

5269
03:26:39,820 --> 03:26:40,954
OF TIME IN NORTH KOREA. 

5270
03:26:40,954 --> 03:26:42,523
HE'S GOT IT VERY CLOSE IT HIS 

5271
03:26:42,523 --> 03:26:42,756
HEART. 

5272
03:26:42,756 --> 03:26:49,296
IT DID COME UP AND THINGS WILL 

5273
03:26:49,296 --> 03:26:54,501
BE HAPPENING. 

5274
03:26:54,501 --> 03:26:54,801
THANK YOU. 

5275
03:26:54,801 --> 03:26:55,168
GREAT QUESTION. 

5276
03:26:55,168 --> 03:26:56,504
YES, JOHN, GO AHEAD. 

5277
03:26:56,504 --> 03:26:57,671
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 

5278

>> THANK YOU, JOHN. 

5280
03:26:58,438 --> 03:27:00,407
>>REPORTER:  RETURNING TO THE 

5281
03:27:00,407 --> 03:27:02,109
QUESTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, YOU 

5282
03:27:02,109 --> 03:27:03,443
SPOKE VERY POWERFULLY ON THE 

5283
03:27:03,443 --> 03:27:04,712
ISSUE DURING YOUR STATE OF THE 

5284
03:27:04,712 --> 03:27:05,079
UNION ADDRESS. 

5285
03:27:05,079 --> 03:27:06,446
>> RIGHT. 

5286
03:27:06,446 --> 03:27:07,514
>>REPORTER:  YOU SHOWED THAT 

5287
03:27:07,514 --> 03:27:09,817
YOU HAD THE DEFACTOR IN THE 

5288
03:27:09,817 --> 03:27:11,785
FIRST LADY'S BOX WITH THE 

5289
03:27:11,785 --> 03:27:14,221
CRUTCHES WHO ESCAPED, AND YOU 

5290
03:27:14,221 --> 03:27:16,624
SAID THAT NORTH KOREA HAS MORE 

5291
03:27:16,624 --> 03:27:18,025
BRUTALLY OPPRESSED ITS PEOPLE 

5292
03:27:18,025 --> 03:27:20,160
THAN ANY OTHER REGIME ON EARTH. 

5293
03:27:20,160 --> 03:27:21,294
DO YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT IS 

5294
03:27:21,294 --> 03:27:22,763
THE CASE HAVING SAT DOWN WITH 

5295
03:27:22,763 --> 03:27:24,965
KIM JONG-UN, AND DOES HE NEED 

5296
03:27:24,965 --> 03:27:25,466
TO CHANGE THAT? 

5297
03:27:25,466 --> 03:27:27,001
>> JOHN, I BELIEVE IT'S A ROUGH 

5298
03:27:27,001 --> 03:27:28,001
SITUATION OVER THERE, THERE'S 

5299
03:27:28,001 --> 03:27:30,771
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, AND WE 

5300
03:27:30,771 --> 03:27:32,773
DID DISCUSS IT TODAY PRETTY 

5301
03:27:32,773 --> 03:27:33,040
STRONGLY. 

5302
03:27:33,040 --> 03:27:34,508
I MEAN, KNOWING WHAT THE MAIN 

5303
03:27:34,508 --> 03:27:37,711
PURPOSE OF WHAT WE WERE DOING 

5304
03:27:37,711 --> 03:27:39,413
IS DENUKING, BUT DISCUSSED IT 

5305
03:27:39,413 --> 03:27:41,615
AT PRETTY GOOD LENGTH. 

5306
03:27:41,615 --> 03:27:42,415
WE'LL BE DOING SOMETHING ON IT. 

5307
03:27:42,415 --> 03:27:43,350
IT'S ROUGH. 

5308
03:27:43,350 --> 03:27:44,718
IT'S ROUGH IN A LOT OF PLACES, 

5309
03:27:44,718 --> 03:27:47,221
BY THE WAY, NOT JUST THERE, BUT 

5310
03:27:47,221 --> 03:27:47,521
IT'S ROUGH. 

5311
03:27:47,521 --> 03:27:49,723
AND WE WILL CONTINUE THAT, AND 

5312
03:27:49,723 --> 03:27:54,628
I THINK ULTIMATELY WE'LL AGREE 

5313
03:27:54,628 --> 03:27:56,797
TO SOMETHING. 

5314
03:27:56,797 --> 03:27:58,098
BUT IT WAS DISCUSSED AT LENGTH 

5315
03:27:58,098 --> 03:27:59,233
OUTSIDE OF THE NUCLEAR 

5316
03:27:59,233 --> 03:28:00,100
SITUATION, ONE OF THE PRIMARY 

5317
03:28:00,100 --> 03:28:00,333
TOPICS. 

5318
03:28:00,333 --> 03:28:02,169
>>REPORTER:  BUT DO YOU THINK 

5319
03:28:02,169 --> 03:28:04,138
THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE TO BRING 

5320
03:28:04,138 --> 03:28:05,673
ON THIS GLORIOUS NEW ERA YOU 

5321
03:28:05,673 --> 03:28:06,306
TALKED ABOUT? 

5322
03:28:06,306 --> 03:28:07,708
>> I THINK IT WILL CHANGE, 

5323
03:28:07,708 --> 03:28:07,908
YEAH. 

5324
03:28:07,908 --> 03:28:08,675
I THINK IT PROBABLY HAS TO, BUT 

5325
03:28:08,675 --> 03:28:11,278
I THINK IT PROBABLY WILL. 

5326
03:28:11,278 --> 03:28:12,012
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

5327
03:28:12,012 --> 03:28:12,245
STEVE. 

5328
03:28:12,245 --> 03:28:14,648
THAT'S YOU, STEVE, RIGHT THERE. 

5329
03:28:14,648 --> 03:28:15,916
>>REPORTER:  YES, SIR. 

5330
03:28:15,916 --> 03:28:16,717
THANK YOU. 

5331
03:28:16,717 --> 03:28:17,984
WHAT TIMETABLE DO YOU ENVISION 

5332
03:28:17,984 --> 03:28:18,719
FOR THE DENUCLEARIZATION, AND 

5333
03:28:18,719 --> 03:28:20,721
IN THE MEANTIME ARE YOU 

5334
03:28:20,721 --> 03:28:21,888
THINKING ABOUT EASING ANY 

5335
03:28:21,888 --> 03:28:22,222
SANCTION? 

5336
03:28:22,222 --> 03:28:22,823
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, 

5337
03:28:22,823 --> 03:28:23,524
SCIENTIFICALLY I'VE BEEN 

5338
03:28:23,524 --> 03:28:24,925
WATCHING AND READING A LOT 

5339
03:28:24,925 --> 03:28:28,963
ABOUT THIS, AND IT DOES TAKE A 

5340
03:28:28,963 --> 03:28:31,899
LONG TIME TO, YOU KNOW, PULL 

5341
03:28:31,899 --> 03:28:33,166
OFF COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION. 

5342
03:28:33,166 --> 03:28:34,668
IT TAKE AS LONG TIME 

5343
03:28:34,668 --> 03:28:35,035
SCIENTIFICALLY. 

5344
03:28:35,035 --> 03:28:36,270
YOU HAVE TO WAIT CERTAIN 

5345
03:28:36,270 --> 03:28:38,606
PERIODS OF TIME, AND A LOT OF 

5346
03:28:38,606 --> 03:28:38,973
THINGS HAPPEN. 

5347
03:28:38,973 --> 03:28:40,373
BUT DESPITE THAT, ONCE YOU 

5348
03:28:40,373 --> 03:28:42,509
START THE PROCESS, IT MEANS 

5349
03:28:42,509 --> 03:28:44,011
IT'S PRETTY MUCH OVER, CAN'T 

5350
03:28:44,011 --> 03:28:44,311
USE THEM. 

5351
03:28:44,311 --> 03:28:45,212
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. 

5352
03:28:45,212 --> 03:28:46,513
AND THAT'S GOING TO START VERY 

5353
03:28:46,513 --> 03:28:46,713
SOON. 

5354
03:28:46,713 --> 03:28:48,716
I BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO START 

5355
03:28:48,716 --> 03:28:49,016
VERY SOON. 

5356
03:28:49,016 --> 03:28:51,919
WE WILL DO IT AS FAST AS IT CAN 

5357
03:28:51,919 --> 03:28:53,120
MECHANICALLY AND PHYSICALLY BE 

5358
03:28:53,120 --> 03:28:53,754
DONE, STEVE. 

5359
03:28:53,754 --> 03:28:55,756
>>REPORTER:  AND THE SANCTIONS? 

5360
03:28:55,756 --> 03:28:57,725
>> THE SANCTIONS WILL COME OFF 

5361
03:28:57,725 --> 03:29:01,695
WHEN WE ARE SURE THAT THE NUKES 

5362
03:29:01,695 --> 03:29:02,996
ARE NO LONGER A FACTOR. 

5363
03:29:02,996 --> 03:29:03,597
SANCTIONS PLAYED A BIG ROLE, 

5364
03:29:03,597 --> 03:29:04,932
BUT THEY'LL COME OFF AT THAT 

5365
03:29:04,932 --> 03:29:05,165
POINT. 

5366
03:29:05,165 --> 03:29:07,401
I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE SOON. 

5367
03:29:07,401 --> 03:29:08,168
BUT THEY'LL COME OFF. 

5368
03:29:08,168 --> 03:29:10,904
AS YOU KNOW, AND AS I'VE SAID, 

5369
03:29:10,904 --> 03:29:11,805
THE SANCTIONS RIGHT NOW REMAIN. 

5370
03:29:11,805 --> 03:29:14,008
BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT -- I 

5371
03:29:14,008 --> 03:29:15,209
ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING 

5372
03:29:15,209 --> 03:29:18,579
THEM OFF, AND THEY'LL COME OFF 

5373
03:29:18,579 --> 03:29:19,947
WHEN WE KNOW WE ARE -- WHEN WE 

5374
03:29:19,947 --> 03:29:20,948
KNOW WHERE DOWN THE ROAD 

5375
03:29:20,948 --> 03:29:22,349
NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN. 

5376
03:29:22,349 --> 03:29:23,517
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU. 

5377
03:29:23,517 --> 03:29:24,451
>> YES, GO AHEAD, PLEASE. 

5378
03:29:24,451 --> 03:29:26,220
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 

5379
03:29:26,220 --> 03:29:26,520
PRESIDENT. 

5380
03:29:26,520 --> 03:29:26,887
>> THANK YOU. 

5381
03:29:26,887 --> 03:29:27,721
>>REPORTER  CONGRATULATIONS ON 

5382
03:29:27,721 --> 03:29:30,557
THIS HISTORIC SUMMIT. 

5383
03:29:30,557 --> 03:29:31,925
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

5384
03:29:31,925 --> 03:29:32,926
CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY, 

5385
03:29:32,926 --> 03:29:33,527
BY THE WAY. 

5386
03:29:33,527 --> 03:29:34,228
CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY. 

5387
03:29:34,228 --> 03:29:34,528
GO AHEAD. 

5388
03:29:34,528 --> 03:29:37,531
>>REPORTER:  YOU SIGNED A 

5389
03:29:37,531 --> 03:29:38,531
DOCUMENT WITH KIM JONG-UN. 

5390
03:29:38,531 --> 03:29:41,068
IT'S ESSENTIALLY A PIECE OF 

5391
03:29:41,068 --> 03:29:41,301
PAPER. 

5392
03:29:41,301 --> 03:29:41,902
YESTERDAY WE HAD A BRIEFING 

5393
03:29:41,902 --> 03:29:43,003
FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

5394
03:29:43,003 --> 03:29:46,173
MIKE POMPEO, AND HE SAID THE 

5395
03:29:46,173 --> 03:29:47,074
FOLLOWING, MANY PRESIDENTS 

5396
03:29:47,074 --> 03:29:48,008
PREVIOUSLY HAVE SIGNED OFF ON 

5397
03:29:48,008 --> 03:29:50,010
PIECES OF PAPER, ONLY TO FIND 

5398
03:29:50,010 --> 03:29:52,212
THAT THE NORTH KOREANS EITHER 

5399
03:29:52,212 --> 03:29:53,414
DIDN'T PROMISE WHAT WE THOUGHT 

5400
03:29:53,414 --> 03:29:56,550
THEY HAD OR ACTUALLY RENEGED ON 

5401
03:29:56,550 --> 03:29:57,017
THOSE PROMISES. 

5402
03:29:57,017 --> 03:29:58,118
WHAT MAKES THIS TIME DIFFERENT, 

5403
03:29:58,118 --> 03:29:58,719
MR. PRESIDENT? 

5404
03:29:58,719 --> 03:30:01,121
>> WELL, YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT 

5405
03:30:01,121 --> 03:30:01,488
ADMINISTRATION. 

5406
03:30:01,488 --> 03:30:03,123
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT, 

5407
03:30:03,123 --> 03:30:05,959
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SECRETARY 

5408
03:30:05,959 --> 03:30:06,359
OF STATE. 

5409
03:30:06,359 --> 03:30:07,528
YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE, YOU 

5410
03:30:07,528 --> 03:30:10,197
KNOW, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO 

5411
03:30:10,197 --> 03:30:11,965
THEM, AND WE GET IT DONE. 

5412
03:30:11,965 --> 03:30:13,000
THE OTHER GROUPS, MAYBE IT 

5413
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:13,867
WASN'T A PRIORITY. 

5414
03:30:13,867 --> 03:30:14,968
I DON'T THINK THEY COULD HAVE 

5415
03:30:14,968 --> 03:30:17,171
DONE IT IF IT WAS A PRIORITY, 

5416
03:30:17,171 --> 03:30:17,438
FRANKLY. 

5417
03:30:17,438 --> 03:30:18,505
I DON'T THINK THEY HONESTLY 

5418
03:30:18,505 --> 03:30:20,040
COULD HAVE DONE IT EVEN IF IT 

5419
03:30:20,040 --> 03:30:21,307
WAS A PRIORITY. 

5420
03:30:21,307 --> 03:30:22,943
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER 

5421
03:30:22,943 --> 03:30:23,243
BACK THEN. 

5422
03:30:23,243 --> 03:30:25,512
FOR ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH 

5423
03:30:25,512 --> 03:30:27,414
EASIER IF THIS WERE 10 YEARS 

5424
03:30:27,414 --> 03:30:29,817
AGO OR FIVE YEARS AGO, AND I'M 

5425
03:30:29,817 --> 03:30:30,718
NOT JUST BLAMING PRESIDENT 

5426
03:30:30,718 --> 03:30:30,951
OBAMA. 

5427
03:30:30,951 --> 03:30:32,219
THIS GOES ACK FOR 25 YEARS 

5428
03:30:32,219 --> 03:30:33,186
THIS SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. 

5429
03:30:33,186 --> 03:30:34,721
I WAS GIVEN A VERY TOUGH HAND. 

5430
03:30:34,721 --> 03:30:37,024
I WAS GIVEN THIS, I WAS GIVEN 

5431
03:30:37,024 --> 03:30:41,428
THE IRAN DEAL, AND PLENTY OF 

5432
03:30:41,428 --> 03:30:41,795
OTHER PROBLEMS. 

5433
03:30:41,795 --> 03:30:42,829
BUT WE ARE -- WE'RE DOING 

5434
03:30:42,829 --> 03:30:43,196
REALLY WELL. 

5435
03:30:43,196 --> 03:30:45,833
AND THE IRAN DEAL, I HAVE TO BE 

5436
03:30:45,833 --> 03:30:47,101
HONEST, I DID IT BECAUSE 

5437
03:30:47,101 --> 03:30:50,304
NUCLEAR IS ALWAYS NUMBER ONE TO 

5438
03:30:50,304 --> 03:30:51,404
ME, NUCLEAR IS NUMBER ONE. 

5439
03:30:51,404 --> 03:30:53,006
BUT ON THE IRAN DEAL, I THINK 

5440
03:30:53,006 --> 03:30:54,575
IRAN IS A DIFFERENT COUNTRY NOW 

5441
03:30:54,575 --> 03:30:56,310
THAN IT WAS THREE OR FOUR 

5442
03:30:56,310 --> 03:30:56,643
MONTHS AGO. 

5443
03:30:56,643 --> 03:30:58,445
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE LOOKING 

5444
03:30:58,445 --> 03:30:59,713
SO MUCH TO THE MEDITERRANEAN. 

5445
03:30:59,713 --> 03:31:01,949
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE LOOKING 

5446
03:31:01,949 --> 03:31:03,917
SO MUCH AT SYRIA LIKE THEY WERE 

5447
03:31:03,917 --> 03:31:04,918
WITH TOTAL CONFIDENCE. 

5448
03:31:04,918 --> 03:31:07,587
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE SO 

5449
03:31:07,587 --> 03:31:08,054
CONFIDENT RIGHT NOW. 

5450
03:31:08,054 --> 03:31:09,923
BUT I HOPE WITH -- WITH THAT 

5451
03:31:09,923 --> 03:31:11,658
BEING SAID, I HOPE THAT AT THE 

5452
03:31:11,658 --> 03:31:12,826
APPROPRIATE TIME AFTER THESE 

5453
03:31:12,826 --> 03:31:15,429
SANCTIONS KICK IN AND THEY ARE 

5454
03:31:15,429 --> 03:31:16,496
BRUTAL WHAT WE'VE PUT ON IRAN, 

5455
03:31:16,496 --> 03:31:17,898
I HOPE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO 

5456
03:31:17,898 --> 03:31:19,399
COME BACK AND NEGOTIATE A REAL 

5457
03:31:19,399 --> 03:31:20,801
DEAL BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO BE 

5458
03:31:20,801 --> 03:31:21,702
ABLE TO DO THAT. 

5459
03:31:21,702 --> 03:31:24,872
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S TOO SOON FOR 

5460
03:31:24,872 --> 03:31:25,105
THAT. 

5461
03:31:25,105 --> 03:31:25,305
YES. 

5462
03:31:25,305 --> 03:31:27,407
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, YOU 

5463
03:31:27,407 --> 03:31:30,444
ALSO TALKED ABOUT ESTABLISHING 

5464
03:31:30,444 --> 03:31:30,944
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. 

5465
03:31:30,944 --> 03:31:31,211
>> YEAH. 

5466
03:31:31,211 --> 03:31:33,146
>>REPORTER:  EXCHANGING 

5467
03:31:33,146 --> 03:31:34,314
AMBASSADORS. 

5468
03:31:34,314 --> 03:31:35,081
HOW LONG BEFORE THAT HAPPENS? 

5469
03:31:35,081 --> 03:31:35,581
>> GOOD QUESTION. 

5470
03:31:35,581 --> 03:31:38,452
HOPEFULLY SOON, BUT WE'LL HAVE 

5471
03:31:38,452 --> 03:31:39,552
TO GET THINGS MOVING FIRST. 

5472
03:31:39,552 --> 03:31:41,521
A LITTLE BIT EARLY FOR THAT. 

5473
03:31:41,521 --> 03:31:47,260
WE HAVE TO GET THINGS MOVING. 

5474
03:31:47,260 --> 03:31:47,627
YES, GO AHEAD. 

5475
03:31:47,627 --> 03:31:47,794
HI. 

5476
03:31:47,794 --> 03:31:49,196
>>REPORTER:  CAN YOU CLARIFY -- 

5477
03:31:49,196 --> 03:31:51,231
WHEN YOU SAID YOU'RE STOPPING 

5478
03:31:51,231 --> 03:31:51,497
WAR GAMES 

5479
03:31:51,497 --> 03:31:51,764
>> YEAH. 

5480
03:31:51,764 --> 03:31:52,599
>>REPORTER:  SO YOU ARE 

5481
03:31:52,599 --> 03:31:53,900
STOPPING THE MILITARY EXERCISES 

5482
03:31:53,900 --> 03:31:54,634
WITH SOUTH KOREA? 

5483
03:31:54,634 --> 03:31:56,436
>> WE'VE DONE EXERCISES FOR A 

5484
03:31:56,436 --> 03:31:59,072
LONG PERIOD OF TIME, WORKING 

5485
03:31:59,072 --> 03:32:01,441
WITH SOUTH KOREA, AND WE CALL 

5486
03:32:01,441 --> 03:32:03,343
THEM WAR GAMES, I CALL THEM WAR 

5487
03:32:03,343 --> 03:32:04,244
GAMES AND THEY'RE TREMENDOUSLY 

5488
03:32:04,244 --> 03:32:04,544
EXPENSIVE. 

5489
03:32:04,544 --> 03:32:07,480
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE 

5490
03:32:07,480 --> 03:32:10,217
SPEND ON THAT IS INCREDIBLE, 

5491
03:32:10,217 --> 03:32:13,153
AND SOUTH KOREA CONTRIBUTES, 

5492
03:32:13,153 --> 03:32:14,021
BUT NOT 100% WHICH IS CERTAINY 

5493
03:32:14,021 --> 03:32:16,023
A SUBJECT WE HAVE TO TALK TO 

5494
03:32:16,023 --> 03:32:17,691
THEM ABOUT ALSO, AND THAT HAS 

5495
03:32:17,691 --> 03:32:20,027
TOO DO WITH THE MILITARY -- TO 

5496
03:32:20,027 --> 03:32:21,361
DO WITH THE MILITARY EXPENSE 

5497
03:32:21,361 --> 03:32:22,829
AND ALSO THE TRADE. 

5498
03:32:22,829 --> 03:32:23,397
SO WE'RE DOING THAT. 

5499
03:32:23,397 --> 03:32:24,498
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A NEW DEAL 

5500
03:32:24,498 --> 03:32:25,699
WITH SOUTH KOREA IN TERMS OF 

5501
03:32:25,699 --> 03:32:27,601
THE TRADE DEAL, BUT WE HAVE TO 

5502
03:32:27,601 --> 03:32:28,802
TALK TO THEM, WE HAVE TO TALK 

5503
03:32:28,802 --> 03:32:30,204
TO MANY COUNTRIES  ABOUT 

5504
03:32:30,204 --> 03:32:30,704
TREATING US FAIRLY. 

5505
03:32:30,704 --> 03:32:32,105
BUT THE WAR GAMES ARE VERY 

5506
03:32:32,105 --> 03:32:32,405
EXPENSIVE. 

5507
03:32:32,405 --> 03:32:35,542
WE PAY FOR A BIG MAJORITY OF 

5508
03:32:35,542 --> 03:32:35,742
THEM. 

5509
03:32:35,742 --> 03:32:36,743
WE FLY IN BOMBERS FROM GUAM. 

5510
03:32:36,743 --> 03:32:38,712
I SAID -- WHEN I FIRST STARTED, 

5511
03:32:38,712 --> 03:32:41,348
I SAID WHERE DO THE BOMBERS 

5512
03:32:41,348 --> 03:32:42,816
COME FROM? 

5513
03:32:42,816 --> 03:32:43,249
GUAM, NEARBY. 

5514
03:32:43,249 --> 03:32:45,486
I SAID, OH, GREAT, NEARBY. 

5515
03:32:45,486 --> 03:32:45,853
WHERE'S NEARBY? 

5516
03:32:45,853 --> 03:32:46,186
6 1/2 HOURS. 

5517
03:32:46,186 --> 03:32:48,655
6 1/2 HOURS, THAT'S A LONG TIME 

5518
03:32:48,655 --> 03:32:51,525
FOR THESE BIG MASSIVE PLANES TO 

5519
03:32:51,525 --> 03:32:53,227
BE FLYING TO SOUTH KOREA TO 

5520
03:32:53,227 --> 03:32:54,127
PRACTICE AND THEN DROP BOMBS 

5521
03:32:54,127 --> 03:32:56,797
ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THEN GO 

5522
03:32:56,797 --> 03:32:57,898
BACK TO GUAM. 

5523
03:32:57,898 --> 03:32:58,531
ILLINOIS HE A LOT ABOUT 

5524
03:32:58,531 --> 03:33:00,300
AIRPLANE -- I KNOW A LOT ABOUT 

5525
03:33:00,300 --> 03:33:01,501
AIRPLANES, IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE, 

5526
03:33:01,501 --> 03:33:03,269
AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT. 

5527
03:33:03,269 --> 03:33:06,006
AND WHAT I DID SAY IS -- AND I 

5528
03:33:06,006 --> 03:33:08,041
THINK IT'S VERY PROVOCATIVE, I 

5529
03:33:08,041 --> 03:33:12,378
HAVE TO TELL YOU, JENNIFER, 

5530
03:33:12,378 --> 03:33:12,946
IT'S A VERY PROVOCATIVE 

5531
03:33:12,946 --> 03:33:13,246
SITUATION. 

5532
03:33:13,246 --> 03:33:18,251
WHEN I SEE THAT AND YOU HAVE A 

5533
03:33:18,251 --> 03:33:19,319
COUNTRY RIGHT NEXT DOOR. 

5534
03:33:19,319 --> 03:33:20,821
SO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT 

5535
03:33:20,821 --> 03:33:21,822
WE'RE NEGOTIATING A VERY 

5536
03:33:21,822 --> 03:33:22,956
COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETE DEAL, I 

5537
03:33:22,956 --> 03:33:25,125
THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO BE 

5538
03:33:25,125 --> 03:33:25,692
HAVING WAR GAMES. 

5539
03:33:25,692 --> 03:33:28,729
SO NUMBER ONE, WE SAVE MONEY, A 

5540
03:33:28,729 --> 03:33:30,530
LOT, AND, NUMBER TWO, IT REALLY 

5541
03:33:30,530 --> 03:33:32,599
IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THEY 

5542
03:33:32,599 --> 03:33:33,099
VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. 

5543
03:33:33,099 --> 03:33:35,002
>>REPORTER:  DOES NORTH KOREA 

5544
03:33:35,002 --> 03:33:36,803
GIVE YOU SOMETHING IN RETURN, 

5545
03:33:36,803 --> 03:33:37,036
THOUGH? 

5546
03:33:37,036 --> 03:33:39,306
>> WELL, WE'VE GOTTEN -- I'VE 

5547
03:33:39,306 --> 03:33:40,107
HEARD THAT. 

5548
03:33:40,107 --> 03:33:41,642
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT -- I 

5549
03:33:41,642 --> 03:33:43,143
DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THEY REALLY 

5550
03:33:43,143 --> 03:33:43,410
MEAN IT. 

5551
03:33:43,410 --> 03:33:45,012
I DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO GO 

5552
03:33:45,012 --> 03:33:46,146
AGAINST THE PRESS, I JUST 

5553
03:33:46,146 --> 03:33:47,247
DON'T, ESPECIALLY NOT TODAY, 

5554
03:33:47,247 --> 03:33:47,948
THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT. 

5555
03:33:47,948 --> 03:33:50,951
BUT I NOTICE THAT SOME OF THE 

5556
03:33:50,951 --> 03:33:52,953
PEOPLE SAYING THAT THE 

5557
03:33:52,953 --> 03:33:54,321
PRESIDENT HAS AGREED TO MEET, 

5558
03:33:54,321 --> 03:33:56,623
HE HAS GIVEN UP SO MUCH. 

5559
03:33:56,623 --> 03:33:57,623
I GAVE UP NOTHING. 

5560
03:33:57,623 --> 03:33:57,958
I'M HERE. 

5561
03:33:57,958 --> 03:33:59,326
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN 25 HOURS, 

5562
03:33:59,326 --> 03:34:01,161
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS 

5563
03:34:01,161 --> 03:34:03,597
APPROPRIATE TO DO BECAUSE WE'VE 

5564
03:34:03,597 --> 03:34:04,798
BEEN NEGOTIATING FOR LITERALLY 

5565
03:34:04,798 --> 03:34:07,501
AROUND THE CLOCK WITH THEM AND 

5566
03:34:07,501 --> 03:34:08,902
WITH US AND WITH JOHN AND WITH 

5567
03:34:08,902 --> 03:34:14,741
MIKE AND A WHOLE TEAM OF VERY 

5568
03:34:14,741 --> 03:34:15,141
TALENTED PEOPLE. 

5569
03:34:15,141 --> 03:34:16,944
BUT WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP 

5570
03:34:16,944 --> 03:34:18,445
ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOU'RE 

5571
03:34:18,445 --> 03:34:19,613
RIGHT, I AGREED TO MEET. 

5572
03:34:19,613 --> 03:34:20,613
AND I THINK THE MEETING WAS 

5573
03:34:20,613 --> 03:34:23,182
EVERY BIT AS GOOD FOR THE 

5574
03:34:23,182 --> 03:34:26,219
UNITED STATES AS IT WAS FOR 

5575
03:34:26,219 --> 03:34:26,552
NORTH KOREA. 

5576
03:34:26,552 --> 03:34:29,389
BUT I JUST WROTE DOWN SOME OF 

5577
03:34:29,389 --> 03:34:32,025
THE THINGS WE GOT, AND THEY -- 

5578
03:34:32,025 --> 03:34:34,127
YOU KNOW, THEY SHOULD, THEY GOT 

5579
03:34:34,127 --> 03:34:35,062
A MEETING. 

5580
03:34:35,062 --> 03:34:36,797
BUT ONLY A PERSON THAT DISLIKES 

5581
03:34:36,797 --> 03:34:38,532
DONALD TRUMP WOULD SAY THAT 

5582
03:34:38,532 --> 03:34:42,202
I'VE AGREED TO MAKE A BIG 

5583
03:34:42,202 --> 03:34:42,502
COMMITMENT. 

5584
03:34:42,502 --> 03:34:42,702
SURE. 

5585
03:34:42,702 --> 03:34:43,503
I'VE AGREED TO TAKE A PERIOD OF 

5586
03:34:43,503 --> 03:34:45,205
TIME TO COME HERE AND MEET, AND 

5587
03:34:45,205 --> 03:34:45,538
THAT'S GOOD. 

5588
03:34:45,538 --> 03:34:46,707
BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT FOR US 

5589
03:34:46,707 --> 03:34:50,944
AS A COUNTRY, AND I THINK IT'S 

5590
03:34:50,944 --> 03:34:52,245
GOOD FOR THEM. 

5591
03:34:52,245 --> 03:34:59,486
BUT WHAT DID THEY DO TO JUSTIFY 

5592
03:34:59,486 --> 03:34:59,853
THIS MEETING? 

5593
03:34:59,853 --> 03:35:01,455
SECURED COMMITMENT FOR COMPLETE 

5594
03:35:01,455 --> 03:35:01,855
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

5595
03:35:01,855 --> 03:35:02,989
THAT'S THE BIG THING. 

5596
03:35:02,989 --> 03:35:05,559
THEY SECURED THE RELEASE OF 

5597
03:35:05,559 --> 03:35:06,193
THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES. 

5598
03:35:06,193 --> 03:35:08,328
THEY ALREADY GAVE THEM TO US 

5599
03:35:08,328 --> 03:35:09,062
TWO MONTHS AGO. 

5600
03:35:09,062 --> 03:35:11,197
THESE PEOPLE ARE NOW LIVING 

5601
03:35:11,197 --> 03:35:12,099
HAPPYILY BACK IN THEIR HOMES 

5602
03:35:12,099 --> 03:35:14,067
WITH -- HAPPILY BACK IN THEIR 

5603
03:35:14,067 --> 03:35:15,235
HOMES WITH THEIR FAMILIES, AND 

5604
03:35:15,235 --> 03:35:18,505
IT WAS PRETTY ROUGH FOR THEM, 

5605
03:35:18,505 --> 03:35:19,839
TO PUT IT MILDLY. 

5606
03:35:19,839 --> 03:35:23,243
SECURE THE COMMITMENT TO 

5607
03:35:23,243 --> 03:35:26,045
RECOVER THE REMAINS, INCLUDING 

5608
03:35:26,045 --> 03:35:28,115
THESE OF OUR FALLEN HEROS, AND 

5609
03:35:28,115 --> 03:35:28,849
THEY'RE GIVING A COMMITMENT, 

5610
03:35:28,849 --> 03:35:30,450
THEY'RE STARTING IT IMMEDIATELY 

5611
03:35:30,450 --> 03:35:31,418
TO RECOVER THE REMAINS. 

5612
03:35:31,418 --> 03:35:32,652
AND I JUST WENT THROUGH HOW 

5613
03:35:32,652 --> 03:35:36,689
MANY PEOPLE ASKED ME ABOUT IT. 

5614
03:35:36,689 --> 03:35:37,690
I WAS AMAZED, ACTUALLY. 

5615
03:35:37,690 --> 03:35:39,159
, SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD ASK ME, 

5616
03:35:39,159 --> 03:35:41,194
IS IT POSSIBLE, IS IT POSSIBLE? 

5617
03:35:41,194 --> 03:35:42,696
AT THAT TIME WE HAD NO 

5618
03:35:42,696 --> 03:35:44,598
RELATIONSHIP TO CHAIRMAN KIM OR 

5619
03:35:44,598 --> 03:35:47,801
TO IT ANYBODY ELSE IN NORTH 

5620
03:35:47,801 --> 03:35:48,034
KOREA. 

5621
03:35:48,034 --> 03:35:51,104
YOU KNOW, IT WAS A VERY CLOSED 

5622
03:35:51,104 --> 03:35:51,371
SOCIETY. 

5623
03:35:51,371 --> 03:35:52,305
SO WE'RE GETTING THE REMAINS 

5624
03:35:52,305 --> 03:35:56,176
BACK, SECURED THE HALT OF ALL 

5625
03:35:56,176 --> 03:35:58,945
MISSILE AND NUCLEAR TESTS FOR 

5626
03:35:58,945 --> 03:36:00,247
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN? 

5627
03:36:00,247 --> 03:36:01,548
SEVEN MONTHS YOU HAVEN'T HAD A 

5628
03:36:01,548 --> 03:36:02,149
MISSILE GO OFF. 

5629
03:36:02,149 --> 03:36:03,650
FOR SEVEN MONTHS YOU HAVEN'T 

5630
03:36:03,650 --> 03:36:05,752
HAD A NUCLEAR TEST, YOU HAVEN'T 

5631
03:36:05,752 --> 03:36:07,454
HAD A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION. 

5632
03:36:07,454 --> 03:36:09,556
I REMEMBER A NUCLEAR EVENT TOOK 

5633
03:36:09,556 --> 03:36:10,890
PLACE, 8.8 ON THE RICHTER 

5634
03:36:10,890 --> 03:36:12,259
SCALE, AND THEY ANNOUNCED, I 

5635
03:36:12,259 --> 03:36:17,330
HEARD IT ON THE RADIO, THEY 

5636
03:36:17,330 --> 03:36:19,032
ANNOUNCED THAT A MASSIVE, YOU 

5637
03:36:19,032 --> 03:36:20,400
KNOW, A MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE TOOK 

5638
03:36:20,400 --> 03:36:21,601
PLACE SOMEWHERE IN ASIA, AND 

5639
03:36:21,601 --> 03:36:22,702
THEN THEY SAID IT WAS NORTH 

5640
03:36:22,702 --> 03:36:24,638
KOREA, AND THEN THEYFOUND OUT 

5641
03:36:24,638 --> 03:36:25,405
IT WAS A NUCLEAR TEST. 

5642
03:36:25,405 --> 03:36:27,841
I SAID I NEVER HEARD OF A 

5643
03:36:27,841 --> 03:36:29,508
RICHTER SKILL IN THE HIGH 8s. 

5644
03:36:29,508 --> 03:36:34,548
AND IF YOU LOOK, THERE HAS BEEN 

5645
03:36:34,548 --> 03:36:35,148
NO MISSILE LAUNCHES. 

5646
03:36:35,148 --> 03:36:36,349
THEY'VE BLOWN UP THEIR MISSILE 

5647
03:36:36,349 --> 03:36:37,451
AREA, THAT'S GOING TO TAKE 

5648
03:36:37,451 --> 03:36:37,684
PLACE. 

5649
03:36:37,684 --> 03:36:39,052
THAT HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN INTO 

5650
03:36:39,052 --> 03:36:39,385
THE CONTRACT. 

5651
03:36:39,385 --> 03:36:42,656
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU THE 

5652
03:36:42,656 --> 03:36:43,323
EXACT DETAILS ON THAT. 

5653
03:36:43,323 --> 03:36:44,958
BUT THEY SECURED THE HALT OF 

5654
03:36:44,958 --> 03:36:49,529
ALL MISSILES AND OF ALL NUCLEAR 

5655
03:36:49,529 --> 03:36:49,863
TESTS. 

5656
03:36:49,863 --> 03:36:51,998
THEY SECURED THE CLOSURE OF 

5657
03:36:51,998 --> 03:36:53,300
THEIR SINGLE PRIMARY NUCLEAR 

5658
03:36:53,300 --> 03:36:55,702
TEST FLIGHT, TEST SITE, ALL 

5659
03:36:55,702 --> 03:36:57,704
THREE OF THEM THERE IN AN AREA 

5660
03:36:57,704 --> 03:37:00,106
THAT'S COMMON AROUND EACH 

5661
03:37:00,106 --> 03:37:02,943
OTHER, THEY SECURED THE 

5662
03:37:02,943 --> 03:37:03,210
CLOSURE. 

5663
03:37:03,210 --> 03:37:04,945
THEY SECURED THE COMMITMENT TO 

5664
03:37:04,945 --> 03:37:05,846
DESTROY THE MISSILE ENGINE 

5665
03:37:05,846 --> 03:37:06,446
TESTING SITE. 

5666
03:37:06,446 --> 03:37:07,747
THAT WAS NOT IN YOUR AGREEMENT. 

5667
03:37:07,747 --> 03:37:11,451
I GOT THAT AFTER WE SIGNED THE 

5668
03:37:11,451 --> 03:37:11,751
AGREEMENT. 

5669
03:37:11,751 --> 03:37:12,986
I SAID, DO ME A FAVOR. 

5670
03:37:12,986 --> 03:37:14,254
YOU'VE GOT THIS MISSILE ENGINE 

5671
03:37:14,254 --> 03:37:16,323
TESTING SITE, WE KNOW WHERE IT 

5672
03:37:16,323 --> 03:37:17,657
IS BECAUSE OF THE HEAT, IT'S 

5673
03:37:17,657 --> 03:37:19,359
INCREDIBLE THE EQUIPMENT WE 

5674
03:37:19,359 --> 03:37:21,861
HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. 

5675
03:37:21,861 --> 03:37:24,564
I SAID CAN YOU CLOSE IT UP? 

5676
03:37:24,564 --> 03:37:27,266
YOU CAN CLOSE IT UP. 

5677
03:37:27,266 --> 03:37:30,003
WE MAINTAINED THE ABILITY TO 

5678
03:37:30,003 --> 03:37:31,504
CONTINUE TO APPLY SANCTIONS. 

5679
03:37:31,504 --> 03:37:32,238
SO WE'RE APPLYING SANCTIONS. 

5680
03:37:32,238 --> 03:37:33,306
NOW, I HAD 300 SANCTIONS THAT I 

5681
03:37:33,306 --> 03:37:34,841
WAS GETTING READY TO PUT ON 

5682
03:37:34,841 --> 03:37:36,076
LAST WEEK, AND I SAID, YOU 

5683
03:37:36,076 --> 03:37:37,644
KNOW, I CAN'T REALLY PUT ON 

5684
03:37:37,644 --> 03:37:39,412
SANCTIONS WHEN I'M MEETING. 

5685
03:37:39,412 --> 03:37:42,048
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY 

5686
03:37:42,048 --> 03:37:43,550
DISRESPECTFUL, 300 VERY BIG 

5687
03:37:43,550 --> 03:37:44,451
ONES, POWERFUL ONES. 

5688
03:37:44,451 --> 03:37:46,152
AND I SAID IT WOULD BE 

5689
03:37:46,152 --> 03:37:46,519
DISRESPECTFUL. 

5690
03:37:46,519 --> 03:37:48,255
SO, JENNIFER, WHEN YOU LOOK AT 

5691
03:37:48,255 --> 03:37:51,658
ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE 

5692
03:37:51,658 --> 03:37:55,362
GOT, AND WHEN WE GOT OUR 

5693
03:37:55,362 --> 03:37:56,396
HOSTAGES BACK, I DIDN'T PAY 

5694
03:37:56,396 --> 03:37:58,331
$1.8 BILLION IN CASH LIKE THE 

5695
03:37:58,331 --> 03:38:01,001
HOSTAGES THAT CAME BACK FROM 

5696
03:38:01,001 --> 03:38:03,770
IRAN WHICH WAS A DISGRACEFUL 

5697
03:38:03,770 --> 03:38:04,837
SITUATION WHAT TOOK PLACE. 

5698
03:38:04,837 --> 03:38:05,605
SO WE'VE GOTTEN A LOT. 

5699
03:38:05,605 --> 03:38:08,642
SO WHEN I HEAR SOMEBODY IN THE 

5700
03:38:08,642 --> 03:38:11,745
MEDIA SAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

5701
03:38:11,745 --> 03:38:13,546
HAS AGREED TO MEET, LIKE IT'S 

5702
03:38:13,546 --> 03:38:14,413
NOT A BIG DEAL TO MEET. 

5703
03:38:14,413 --> 03:38:16,550
I THINK WE SHOULD MEET ON A LOT 

5704
03:38:16,550 --> 03:38:17,951
OF DIFFERENT TOPIC, NOT JUST 

5705
03:38:17,951 --> 03:38:18,351
THIS ONE. 

5706
03:38:18,351 --> 03:38:22,255
AND I REALLY BELIEVE A LOT OF 

5707
03:38:22,255 --> 03:38:24,791
GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN. 

5708
03:38:24,791 --> 03:38:25,292
YES, GO AHEAD, PLEASE. 

5709
03:38:25,292 --> 03:38:26,159
>>REPORTER:  SIR, YOU JUST 

5710
03:38:26,159 --> 03:38:27,661
LISTED OFF A LOT OF THINGS THAT 

5711
03:38:27,661 --> 03:38:29,262
YOU SAY YOU GOT IN THIS 

5712
03:38:29,262 --> 03:38:29,529
MEETING. 

5713
03:38:29,529 --> 03:38:30,931
IT WASN'T TOO LONG AGO, THOUGH, 

5714
03:38:30,931 --> 03:38:32,031
THAT YOU SAID YOU DEFINED 

5715
03:38:32,031 --> 03:38:34,201
SUCCESS OF THIS MEETING BY 

5716
03:38:34,201 --> 03:38:35,301
NORTH KOREA GIVING UP ITS 

5717
03:38:35,301 --> 03:38:35,702
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

5718
03:38:35,702 --> 03:38:36,536
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING. 

5719
03:38:36,536 --> 03:38:38,104
>>REPORTER:  CAN YOU TALK ABOUT 

5720
03:38:38,104 --> 03:38:38,671
HOW -- 

5721
03:38:38,671 --> 03:38:41,874
>> SURE, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE 

5722
03:38:41,874 --> 03:38:42,141
DOING. 

5723
03:38:42,141 --> 03:38:44,144
I DON'T THINK -- YEAH. 

5724
03:38:44,144 --> 03:38:47,948
>>REPORTER:  KIM JONG-UN FOR A 

5725
03:38:47,948 --> 03:38:48,381
COMPLETE VERIFIABLE 

5726
03:38:48,381 --> 03:38:48,782
IRREVERSIBLE -- 

5727
03:38:48,782 --> 03:38:49,349
>> I DIDN'T HONESTLY -- 

5728
03:38:49,349 --> 03:38:51,451
>>REPORTER:  AND WHY YOU DIDN'T 

5729
03:38:51,451 --> 03:38:53,053
SECURE THOSE DETAILS IN THIS 

5730
03:38:53,053 --> 03:38:53,353
AGREEMENT? 

5731
03:38:53,353 --> 03:38:54,354
>> BECAUSE THERE'S NO TIME. 

5732
03:38:54,354 --> 03:38:56,656
I'M HERE FOR ONE DAY. 

5733
03:38:56,656 --> 03:38:57,958
WE'RE TOGETHER FOR MANY HOURS 

5734
03:38:57,958 --> 03:38:59,459
INTENSIVELY, BUT THE PROCESS IS 

5735
03:38:59,459 --> 03:39:00,793
NOW GOING TO TAKE PLACE. 

5736
03:39:00,793 --> 03:39:02,262
AND I WOULD BE SURPRISED, MIKE, 

5737
03:39:02,262 --> 03:39:04,030
IF THEY HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED 

5738
03:39:04,030 --> 03:39:04,731
ALREADY. 

5739
03:39:04,731 --> 03:39:05,164
THEY HAVE STARTED. 

5740
03:39:05,164 --> 03:39:07,767
THEY BLEW UP THEIR SITES. 

5741
03:39:07,767 --> 03:39:09,703
THEY BLEW UP THEIR TESTING 

5742
03:39:09,703 --> 03:39:09,903
SITE. 

5743
03:39:09,903 --> 03:39:12,205
SO -- BUT I WILL SAY HE KNEW 

5744
03:39:12,205 --> 03:39:13,807
PRIOR TO COMING -- YOU KNOW, 

5745
03:39:13,807 --> 03:39:17,844
THIS WASN'T LIKE A SURPRISE, IT 

5746
03:39:17,844 --> 03:39:19,345
WASN'T LIKE WE'VE NEVER 

5747
03:39:19,345 --> 03:39:19,678
DISCUSSED IT. 

5748
03:39:19,678 --> 03:39:21,247
WE DISCUSSED IT, MIKE DISCUSSED 

5749
03:39:21,247 --> 03:39:23,149
IT VERY STRONGLY WITH HIS 

5750
03:39:23,149 --> 03:39:24,016
COUNTERPART IN NORTH KOREA. 

5751
03:39:24,016 --> 03:39:25,452
THEY KNEW THAT THIS WAS -- 

5752
03:39:25,452 --> 03:39:27,153
LET'S SAY THEY DIDN'T AGREE TO 

5753
03:39:27,153 --> 03:39:28,054
THAT, I COULDN'T SIGN ANY 

5754
03:39:28,054 --> 03:39:28,354
AGREEMENT. 

5755
03:39:28,354 --> 03:39:31,858
THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT THAT 

5756
03:39:31,858 --> 03:39:32,358
COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNED. 

5757
03:39:32,358 --> 03:39:34,461
SO THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT, AND IT 

5758
03:39:34,461 --> 03:39:36,263
WASN'T A BIG POINT TODAY 

5759
03:39:36,263 --> 03:39:37,430
BECAUSE REALLY THIS HAD BEEN 

5760
03:39:37,430 --> 03:39:38,664
TAKEN CARE OF MORE THAN ANY 

5761
03:39:38,664 --> 03:39:40,233
OTHER THING BECAUSE IT WAS ALL 

5762
03:39:40,233 --> 03:39:40,633
ABOUT THIS. 

5763
03:39:40,633 --> 03:39:41,901
THIS HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF 

5764
03:39:41,901 --> 03:39:43,403
BEFORE WE GOT HERE. 

5765
03:39:43,403 --> 03:39:44,704
SO WHEN WE BROUGHT THAT UP 

5766
03:39:44,704 --> 03:39:48,575
TODAY, YOU SEE THE LANGUAGE, 

5767
03:39:48,575 --> 03:39:50,443
IT'S VERY STRONG. 

5768
03:39:50,443 --> 03:39:51,077
IT'S IN THE DOCUMENT. 

5769
03:39:51,077 --> 03:39:51,477
YES, MA'AM. 

5770
03:39:51,477 --> 03:39:53,647
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 

5771
03:39:53,647 --> 03:39:53,947
PRESIDENT. 

5772
03:39:53,947 --> 03:39:54,581
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE 

5773
03:39:54,581 --> 03:39:55,649
MILITARY CONSEQUENCES FOR NORTH 

5774
03:39:55,649 --> 03:39:57,651
KOREA IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW 

5775
03:39:57,651 --> 03:39:58,751
THROUGH ON THE COMMITMENTS THAT 

5776
03:39:58,751 --> 03:39:59,685
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? 

5777
03:39:59,685 --> 03:40:01,588
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO TALK 

5778
03:40:01,588 --> 03:40:02,355
-- YEAH, I KNOW. 

5779
03:40:02,355 --> 03:40:03,156
THAT'S A TOUGH THING TO TALK 

5780
03:40:03,156 --> 03:40:04,658
ABOUT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO 

5781
03:40:04,658 --> 03:40:05,691
BE THREATENING. 

5782
03:40:05,691 --> 03:40:07,527
I DON'T WANT TO BE THREATENING. 

5783
03:40:07,527 --> 03:40:08,762
THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT, AND 

5784
03:40:08,762 --> 03:40:11,131
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT WAS PERHAPS 

5785
03:40:11,131 --> 03:40:13,133
GOING TO HAPPEN, AND, YOU KNOW, 

5786
03:40:13,133 --> 03:40:14,801
SEOUL HAS 28 MILLION PEOPLE. 

5787
03:40:14,801 --> 03:40:15,802
WE THINK WE HAVE BIG CITIES, 

5788
03:40:15,802 --> 03:40:18,471
YOU LOOK AT NEW YORK WHERE IT 

5789
03:40:18,471 --> 03:40:20,206
HAS 8 MILLION PEOPLE, WE THINK 

5790
03:40:20,206 --> 03:40:21,073
IT IS A BIG CITY. 

5791
03:40:21,073 --> 03:40:22,375
SEOUL HAS 28 MILLION PEOPLE, 

5792
03:40:22,375 --> 03:40:23,743
THINK ABOUT THAT, AND IT'S 

5793
03:40:23,743 --> 03:40:28,581
RIGHT NEXT TO THE BORDER. 

5794
03:40:28,581 --> 03:40:31,484
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE DMZ, 

5795
03:40:31,484 --> 03:40:32,084
IT'S RIGHT THERE. 

5796
03:40:32,084 --> 03:40:34,287
IF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED -- 

5797
03:40:34,287 --> 03:40:35,488
I'VE HEARD, OH, 100,000 PEOPLE. 

5798
03:40:35,488 --> 03:40:38,258
I THINK YOU COULD HAVE LOST 20 

5799
03:40:38,258 --> 03:40:39,559
MILLION PEOPLE, 30 MILLION 

5800
03:40:39,559 --> 03:40:39,792
PEOPLE. 

5801
03:40:39,792 --> 03:40:41,061
THIS IS REALLY AN HONOR FOR ME 

5802
03:40:41,061 --> 03:40:42,962
TO BE DOING THIS BECAUSE I 

5803
03:40:42,962 --> 03:40:44,631
THINK, YOU KNOW, POTENTIALLY 

5804
03:40:44,631 --> 03:40:46,065
YOU COULD HAVE LOST 30, 40, 50 

5805
03:40:46,065 --> 03:40:46,432
MILLION PEOPLE. 

5806
03:40:46,432 --> 03:40:47,934
THE CITY OF SEOUL, ONE OF THE 

5807
03:40:47,934 --> 03:40:50,136
BIGGEST CITIES IN THE WORLD IS 

5808
03:40:50,136 --> 03:40:51,037
RIGHT NEXT TO THE BORDER. 

5809
03:40:51,037 --> 03:40:52,138
>>REPORTER:  YOU ONCE SPOKE 

5810
03:40:52,138 --> 03:40:53,907
ABOUT FIRE AND FURY, IS THAT NO 

5811
03:40:53,907 --> 03:40:55,241
LONGER THE CASE? 

5812
03:40:55,241 --> 03:40:57,644
>> WELL, AT THAT TIME WE NEEDED 

5813
03:40:57,644 --> 03:40:59,045
PERHAPS FIRE AND FURY BECAUSE 

5814
03:40:59,045 --> 03:41:02,248
WE COULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED THAT 

5815
03:41:02,248 --> 03:41:03,950
KIND OF CAPABILITY FROM THE 

5816
03:41:03,950 --> 03:41:04,584
STANDPOINT OF THE UNITED 

5817
03:41:04,584 --> 03:41:05,652
STATES, AND CERTAINLY JAPAN 

5818
03:41:05,652 --> 03:41:07,253
WASN'T GOING TO ALLOW IT 

5819
03:41:07,253 --> 03:41:07,486
EITHER. 

5820
03:41:07,486 --> 03:41:09,255
JAPAN IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR. 

5821
03:41:09,255 --> 03:41:09,889
>>REPORTER:  ONE MORE THING. 

5822
03:41:09,889 --> 03:41:10,857
MR. PRESIDENT, COULD YOU TELL 

5823
03:41:10,857 --> 03:41:12,659
US ABOUT THE VIDEO THAT YOU 

5824
03:41:12,659 --> 03:41:13,159
SHOWED BEFORE THIS? 

5825
03:41:13,159 --> 03:41:13,459
>> YEAH. 

5826
03:41:13,459 --> 03:41:14,761
>>REPORTER:  WHEN DID YOU SHOW 

5827
03:41:14,761 --> 03:41:17,030
THAT TO KIM, WHAT WAS THE GOAL 

5828
03:41:17,030 --> 03:41:17,330
THERE? 

5829
03:41:17,330 --> 03:41:17,597
>> TODAY. 

5830
03:41:17,597 --> 03:41:19,132
WE HAD IT MADE UP BY SOME -- I 

5831
03:41:19,132 --> 03:41:20,199
HOPE YOU LIKED IT. 

5832
03:41:20,199 --> 03:41:23,670
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. 

5833
03:41:23,670 --> 03:41:25,305
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING 

5834
03:41:25,305 --> 03:41:27,940
ENOUGH TO SHOW, ONE IN ENGLISH 

5835
03:41:27,940 --> 03:41:30,576
AND ONE IN KOREAN. 

5836
03:41:30,576 --> 03:41:34,313
AND WE HAD IT MADE UP. 

5837
03:41:34,313 --> 03:41:35,481
I SHOWED IT TO HIM TODAY, 

5838
03:41:35,481 --> 03:41:36,349
DURING THE MEETING, TOWARD THE 

5839
03:41:36,349 --> 03:41:38,351
END OF THE MEETING, AND I THINK 

5840
03:41:38,351 --> 03:41:38,851
HE LOVED IT. 

5841
03:41:38,851 --> 03:41:39,852
THEY WERE GIVEN -- WE DIDN'T 

5842
03:41:39,852 --> 03:41:41,755
HAVE A BIG SCREEN LIKE YOU HAVE 

5843
03:41:41,755 --> 03:41:42,688
THE LUXURY OF HAVING. 

5844
03:41:42,688 --> 03:41:45,024
WE DIDN'T NEED IT BECAUSE WE 

5845
03:41:45,024 --> 03:41:50,230
HAD IT ON A CASSETTE, AN  iPAD, 

5846
03:41:50,230 --> 03:41:51,197
AND THEY PLAYED IT. 

5847
03:41:51,197 --> 03:41:52,632
AND ABOUT EIGHT OF THEIR 

5848
03:41:52,632 --> 03:41:53,333
REPRESENTATIVES WHO ARE 

5849
03:41:53,333 --> 03:41:55,067
WATCHING IT, AND I THOUGHT THEY 

5850
03:41:55,067 --> 03:41:56,202
WERE FASCINATE BID IT. 

5851
03:41:56,202 --> 03:41:57,337
I THOUGHT IT WAS WELL DONE. 

5852
03:41:57,337 --> 03:41:59,272
I SHOWED IT TO YOU BECAUSE 

5853
03:41:59,272 --> 03:41:59,706
THAT'S THE FUTURE. 

5854
03:41:59,706 --> 03:42:01,674
I MEAN, THAT VERY WELL COULD BE 

5855
03:42:01,674 --> 03:42:02,007
THE FUTURE. 

5856
03:42:02,007 --> 03:42:03,977
AND THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS 

5857
03:42:03,977 --> 03:42:07,614
JUST NOT A VERY GOOD 

5858
03:42:07,614 --> 03:42:07,947
ALTERNATIVE. 

5859
03:42:07,947 --> 03:42:08,381
IT'S JUST NOT GOOD. 

5860
03:42:08,381 --> 03:42:09,482
BUT I SHOWED IT BECAUSE I 

5861
03:42:09,482 --> 03:42:10,183
REALLY WANT HIM TO DO 

5862
03:42:10,183 --> 03:42:10,483
SOMETHING. 

5863
03:42:10,483 --> 03:42:11,684
NOW, I DON'T THINK I HAD TO 

5864
03:42:11,684 --> 03:42:13,086
SHOW IT BECAUSE I REALLY 

5865
03:42:13,086 --> 03:42:16,890
BELIEVE HE WANTS TO -- I THINK 

5866
03:42:16,890 --> 03:42:21,294
HE WANTS TO GET IT DONE. 

5867
03:42:21,294 --> 03:42:22,428
YES, GO AHEAD. 

5868
03:42:22,428 --> 03:42:23,496
HOW'S STATEN ISLAND FERRY 

5869
03:42:23,496 --> 03:42:23,863
DOING, OKAY? 

5870
03:42:23,863 --> 03:42:24,397
>>REPORTER:  GOING WELL. 

5871
03:42:24,397 --> 03:42:25,565
>> HE WROTE THE BEST STORY 

5872
03:42:25,565 --> 03:42:27,066
ABOUT ME WITH THE STATEN ISLAND 

5873
03:42:27,066 --> 03:42:28,368
FERRY AND AFTER THAT HE'S NEVER 

5874
03:42:28,368 --> 03:42:29,068
WRITTEN A GOOD STORY. 

5875
03:42:29,068 --> 03:42:30,035
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. 

5876
03:42:30,035 --> 03:42:31,271
>>REPORTER:  IT'S A LONG TIME 

5877
03:42:31,271 --> 03:42:32,472
AGO, SIR. 

5878
03:42:32,472 --> 03:42:33,172
>> IT'S A LONG TIME AGO. 

5879
03:42:33,172 --> 03:42:33,873
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, 

5880
03:42:33,873 --> 03:42:35,808
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK FOR YOU 

5881
03:42:35,808 --> 03:42:36,909
ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. 

5882
03:42:36,909 --> 03:42:37,977
YOU'RE LEAVING THIS SUMMIT HERE 

5883
03:42:37,977 --> 03:42:39,312
IN SINGAPORE HAVING DETERMINED 

5884
03:42:39,312 --> 03:42:41,046
THAT KIM JONG-UN IS A TALENTED 

5885
03:42:41,046 --> 03:42:41,247
MAN. 

5886
03:42:41,247 --> 03:42:43,616
YOU LEFT THE G7 SUMMIT A FEW 

5887
03:42:43,616 --> 03:42:46,319
DAYS AGO IN CANADA HAVING 

5888
03:42:46,319 --> 03:42:47,821
DETERMINED THAT PRIME MINISTER 

5889
03:42:47,821 --> 03:42:49,155
TRUDEAU IS WEAK AND DISHONEST. 

5890
03:42:49,155 --> 03:42:50,723
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO AMERICA'S 

5891
03:42:50,723 --> 03:42:52,925
ALLIES WHO WORRY THAT YOU MIGHT 

5892
03:42:52,925 --> 03:42:53,859
BE JEOPARDIZING OUR LONG-TERM 

5893
03:42:53,859 --> 03:42:56,296
ALLIANCES AND WHO WORRY THAT 

5894
03:42:56,296 --> 03:42:58,198
YOU MIGHT BE TREATING OUR 

5895
03:42:58,198 --> 03:42:59,765
HISTORIC FRIENDS AS ENEMY AND 

5896
03:42:59,765 --> 03:43:00,633
OUR HISTORIC ENEMIES AS FRIEND? 

5897
03:43:00,633 --> 03:43:01,968
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK 

5898
03:43:01,968 --> 03:43:03,035
IT'S A VERY FAIR QUESTION. 

5899
03:43:03,035 --> 03:43:05,805
I HAD A VERY GOOD MEETING WITH 

5900
03:43:05,805 --> 03:43:08,374
THE G7, AND I LEFT THE MEETING. 

5901
03:43:08,374 --> 03:43:11,010
AND I'LL BE HONEST, WE ARE 

5902
03:43:11,010 --> 03:43:12,412
BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY 

5903
03:43:12,412 --> 03:43:15,348
VIRTUALLY EVERY ONE OF THOSE 

5904
03:43:15,348 --> 03:43:15,915
COUNTRIES, VERY, VERY 

5905
03:43:15,915 --> 03:43:16,215
SERIOUSLY. 

5906
03:43:16,215 --> 03:43:16,849
NOW, THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE 

5907
03:43:16,849 --> 03:43:18,218
OF BAD MANAGEMENT AT THE TOP, 

5908
03:43:18,218 --> 03:43:19,319
BECAUSE OF PRESIDENTS THAT 

5909
03:43:19,319 --> 03:43:21,621
DIDN'T CARE ABOUT TRADE OR 

5910
03:43:21,621 --> 03:43:23,323
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT OR 

5911
03:43:23,323 --> 03:43:25,024
WHATEVER REASON, FOR MANY YEARS 

5912
03:43:25,024 --> 03:43:26,726
WITH CHINA BEING OBVIOUSLY THE 

5913
03:43:26,726 --> 03:43:29,362
MOST SUCCESSFUL AT IT, BUT THE 

5914
03:43:29,362 --> 03:43:30,897
EUROPEAN UNION IS SECOND, $151 

5915
03:43:30,897 --> 03:43:32,599
BILLION WE LOST, THEY WERE 

5916
03:43:32,599 --> 03:43:35,735
REPRESENTED AT THE MEETING, AND 

5917
03:43:35,735 --> 03:43:39,906
WE'RE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF 

5918
03:43:39,906 --> 03:43:40,239
ON TRADE. 

5919
03:43:40,239 --> 03:43:41,440
CANADA DOES HAVE VERY BIG 

5920
03:43:41,440 --> 03:43:43,943
ADVANTAGES OVER US IN TERMS OF 

5921
03:43:43,943 --> 03:43:44,310
TRADE DEFICITS. 

5922
03:43:44,310 --> 03:43:46,479
WE HAVE A BIG TRADE DEFICIT 

5923
03:43:46,479 --> 03:43:46,879
WITH CANADA. 

5924
03:43:46,879 --> 03:43:49,749
I WAS READING WHERE, OH, IT'S 

5925
03:43:49,749 --> 03:43:50,315
ACTUALLY A SURPLUS. 

5926
03:43:50,315 --> 03:43:51,016
IT'S NOT A SURPLUS. 

5927
03:43:51,016 --> 03:43:52,452
IT'S EITHER 17, BUT IT COULD 

5928
03:43:52,452 --> 03:43:53,086
ACTUALLY BE 100. 

5929
03:43:53,086 --> 03:43:53,620
YOU KNOW, THEY PUT OUT A 

5930
03:43:53,620 --> 03:43:54,988
DOCUMENT, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU 

5931
03:43:54,988 --> 03:43:56,856
SAW IT, THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO 

5932
03:43:56,856 --> 03:43:58,591
SEE IT, BUT WE FOUND IT, 

5933
03:43:58,591 --> 03:43:59,993
PERHAPS THEY WERE TRYING TO 

5934
03:43:59,993 --> 03:44:02,128
SHOW THE POWER THEY HAVE, IT'S 

5935
03:44:02,128 --> 03:44:03,829
CLOSE TO $100 BILLION A YEAR 

5936
03:44:03,829 --> 03:44:05,464
LOST WITH CANADA. 

5937
03:44:05,464 --> 03:44:08,301
THEY DON'T TAKE OUR FARM 

5938
03:44:08,301 --> 03:44:09,802
PRODUCTS, MANY OF THEM, THEY 

5939
03:44:09,802 --> 03:44:11,404
CHARGE WHAT WAS 270%, BUT 

5940
03:44:11,404 --> 03:44:12,771
SOMEBODY TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY 

5941
03:44:12,771 --> 03:44:15,842
THAT A FEW MONTHS AGO THEY 

5942
03:44:15,842 --> 03:44:17,844
RAISED IT TO 295% FOR DAIRY 

5943
03:44:17,844 --> 03:44:18,111
PRODUCTS. 

5944
03:44:18,111 --> 03:44:19,145
AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO OUR 

5945
03:44:19,145 --> 03:44:20,079
FARMERS, AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR 

5946
03:44:20,079 --> 03:44:22,482
TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY, 

5947
03:44:22,482 --> 03:44:23,850
THE WORKERS, THE FARMERS, THE 

5948
03:44:23,850 --> 03:44:25,351
COMPANIES, AND WE ARE NOT ABLE 

5949
03:44:25,351 --> 03:44:27,353
TO -- THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS 

5950
03:44:27,353 --> 03:44:28,087
BARRIERS UP, THEY HAVE 

5951
03:44:28,087 --> 03:44:29,856
TREMENDOUS TARIFFS. 

5952
03:44:29,856 --> 03:44:31,357
SO WHEN I PUT IN A A 

5953
03:44:31,357 --> 03:44:31,991
COUNTERVEILING TARIFF JUST TO 

5954
03:44:31,991 --> 03:44:34,460
GET US UP A LITTLE BIT SO THE 

5955
03:44:34,460 --> 03:44:35,728
BALANCE ISN'T SO MUCH, IT'S 

5956
03:44:35,728 --> 03:44:37,297
LIKE THIS, THEY SAID, OH, 

5957
03:44:37,297 --> 03:44:37,764
THAT'S SO TERRIBLE. 

5958
03:44:37,764 --> 03:44:38,298
I SAID WHAT'S TERRIBLE. 

5959
03:44:38,298 --> 03:44:39,632
WE HAVE TO CATCH YOU A LITTLE 

5960
03:44:39,632 --> 03:44:39,832
BIT. 

5961
03:44:39,832 --> 03:44:41,734
WE HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE 

5962
03:44:41,734 --> 03:44:42,602
BALANCE, EVEN IF IT'S NOT 

5963
03:44:42,602 --> 03:44:44,504
COMPLETE, WE HAVE TO HAVE A 

5964
03:44:44,504 --> 03:44:46,071
LITTLE BALANCE. 

5965
03:44:46,071 --> 03:44:48,440
I SAY THIS WITH MANY COUNTRIES. 

5966
03:44:48,440 --> 03:44:50,243
ANYWAY, WE CAME -- WE FINISHED 

5967
03:44:50,243 --> 03:44:51,945
THE MEETING REALLY EVERYBODY 

5968
03:44:51,945 --> 03:44:53,646
WAS HAPPY, AND I GREEDED TO 

5969
03:44:53,646 --> 03:44:55,448
SIGN SOMETHING -- I AGREED TO 

5970
03:44:55,448 --> 03:44:56,449
SIGN SOMETHING. 

5971
03:44:56,449 --> 03:44:58,952
I ASKED FOR CHANGE, I DEMANDED 

5972
03:44:58,952 --> 03:44:59,185
CHANGE. 

5973
03:44:59,185 --> 03:45:00,019
IN FACT, THE PICTURE WITH 

5974
03:45:00,019 --> 03:45:01,454
ANGELA MERKEL WHO I GET ALONG 

5975
03:45:01,454 --> 03:45:03,256
WITH VERY WELL WHERE I'M SIT 

5976
03:45:03,256 --> 03:45:04,189
THRG LIKE THIS, THAT PICTURE IS 

5977
03:45:04,189 --> 03:45:05,324
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE DOCUMENT 

5978
03:45:05,324 --> 03:45:06,859
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE THE 

5979
03:45:06,859 --> 03:45:10,196
FINAL DOCUMENT AS CHANGED BY 

5980
03:45:10,196 --> 03:45:10,830
THE CHANGES THAT I REQUESTED. 

5981
03:45:10,830 --> 03:45:12,498
THAT WAS VERY FRIENDLY -- I 

5982
03:45:12,498 --> 03:45:13,533
KNOW IT DIDN'T LOOK FRIENDLY 

5983
03:45:13,533 --> 03:45:15,835
AND I KNOW IT WAS REPORTED SORT 

5984
03:45:15,835 --> 03:45:18,004
OF NASTY BOTH WAYS, I WAS ANGRY 

5985
03:45:18,004 --> 03:45:18,304
AT HER. 

5986
03:45:18,304 --> 03:45:19,739
ACTUALLY, WE WERE JUST TALKING, 

5987
03:45:19,739 --> 03:45:22,141
THE WHOLE GROUP ABOUT SOMETHING 

5988
03:45:22,141 --> 03:45:23,042
UNRELATED TO EVERYTHING, VERY 

5989
03:45:23,042 --> 03:45:23,676
FRIENDLY, WAITING FOR THE 

5990
03:45:23,676 --> 03:45:25,445
DOCUMENT TO COME BACK SO I 

5991
03:45:25,445 --> 03:45:26,479
COULD READ IT BEFORE I LEAVE. 

5992
03:45:26,479 --> 03:45:28,648
ANYWAY, I LEFT AND IT WAS VERY 

5993
03:45:28,648 --> 03:45:28,915
FRIENDLY. 

5994
03:45:28,915 --> 03:45:30,149
WHEN I GOT ONTO THE PLANE, I 

5995
03:45:30,149 --> 03:45:31,050
THINK THAT JUSTIN PROBABLY 

5996
03:45:31,050 --> 03:45:33,753
DIDN'T KNOW THAT AIR FORCE ONE 

5997
03:45:33,753 --> 03:45:34,988
HAS ABOUT 20 TELEVISIONS, AND I 

5998
03:45:34,988 --> 03:45:36,255
SEE THE TELEVISION, AND HE'S 

5999
03:45:36,255 --> 03:45:37,657
GIVING A NEWS CONFERENCE ABOUT 

6000
03:45:37,657 --> 03:45:39,692
HOW HE WILL NOT BE PUSHED 

6001
03:45:39,692 --> 03:45:41,594
AROUND BY THE UNITED STATES. 

6002
03:45:41,594 --> 03:45:43,829
AND I SAY PUSH HIM AROUND? 

6003
03:45:43,829 --> 03:45:46,065
WE JUST SHOOK HANDS. 

6004
03:45:46,065 --> 03:45:46,965
IT WAS VERY FRIENDLY. 

6005
03:45:46,965 --> 03:45:48,468
LOOK, COUNTRIES CANNOT CONTINUE 

6006
03:45:48,468 --> 03:45:50,502
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US ON 

6007
03:45:50,502 --> 03:45:50,736
TRADE. 

6008
03:45:50,736 --> 03:45:52,705
THE NUMBERS ARE OUT. 

6009
03:45:52,705 --> 03:45:54,173
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, 

6010
03:45:54,173 --> 03:45:55,942
AND OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS, 

6011
03:45:55,942 --> 03:46:00,647
BUT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF 

6012
03:46:00,647 --> 03:46:01,748
YEARS THIS COUNTRY HAS LOST 

6013
03:46:01,748 --> 03:46:04,450
$800 BILLION ON TRADE WITH 

6014
03:46:04,450 --> 03:46:09,188
OTHER COUNTRIES, THE BIGGEST 

6015
03:46:09,188 --> 03:46:11,157
ONE BEING CHINA, $800 BILLION, 

6016
03:46:11,157 --> 03:46:12,525
$151 WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. 

6017
03:46:12,525 --> 03:46:13,659
THEY DON'T TAKE OUR 

6018
03:46:13,659 --> 03:46:14,293
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, BARELY. 

6019
03:46:14,293 --> 03:46:16,462
THEY DON'T TAKE A LOT OF WHAT 

6020
03:46:16,462 --> 03:46:18,531
WE HAVE, AND YET THEY SEND 

6021
03:46:18,531 --> 03:46:21,401
MERCEDES IN TO US, THEY SEND 

6022
03:46:21,401 --> 03:46:22,568
BMWs INTO US BY THE MILLIONS. 

6023
03:46:22,568 --> 03:46:23,403
IT'S VERY UNFAIR. 

6024
03:46:23,403 --> 03:46:24,137
AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO OUR 

6025
03:46:24,137 --> 03:46:26,139
WORKERS, AND I'M GOING TO 

6026
03:46:26,139 --> 03:46:40,953
STRAIGHTEN IT OUT, AND IT WON'T 

6027
03:46:40,953 --> 03:46:41,320
EVEN BE TOUGH. 

6028
03:46:41,320 --> 03:46:41,620
THANK YOU. 

6029
03:46:41,620 --> 03:46:41,887
GO AHEAD. 

6030
03:46:41,887 --> 03:46:47,160
GO AHEAD. [ 

6031
03:46:47,160 --> 03:46:54,133
INAUDIBLE  ] 

6032
03:46:54,133 --> 03:46:55,535
>> I WOULD LIKE TO INVOLVE 

6033
03:46:55,535 --> 03:46:56,135
CONGRESS, YES. 

6034
03:46:56,135 --> 03:46:57,536
I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH 

6035
03:46:57,536 --> 03:46:58,337
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, I REALLY DID, 

6036
03:46:58,337 --> 03:46:59,939
OTHER THAN HE HAD A NEWS 

6037
03:46:59,939 --> 03:47:00,606
CONFERENCE THAT HE HAD BECAUSE 

6038
03:47:00,606 --> 03:47:03,142
HE ASSUMED I WAS IN AN AIRPLANE 

6039
03:47:03,142 --> 03:47:03,809
AND I WASN'T WATCHING. 

6040
03:47:03,809 --> 03:47:05,144
HE LEARNED THAT'S GOING TO COST 

6041
03:47:05,144 --> 03:47:07,480
A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE PEOPLE 

6042
03:47:07,480 --> 03:47:07,813
OF CANADA. 

6043
03:47:07,813 --> 03:47:08,147
HE LEARNED. 

6044
03:47:08,147 --> 03:47:09,749
YOU CAN'T DO THAT. 

6045
03:47:09,749 --> 03:47:10,249
YOU CAN'T DO THAT. 

6046
03:47:10,249 --> 03:47:11,116
WE LAUGHED. 

6047
03:47:11,116 --> 03:47:12,151
WE HAD A VERY GOOD 

6048
03:47:12,151 --> 03:47:13,252
RELATIONSHIP. 

6049
03:47:13,252 --> 03:47:14,253
I'VE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP 

6050
03:47:14,253 --> 03:47:14,586
WITH JUSTIN. 

6051
03:47:14,586 --> 03:47:15,988
I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH 

6052
03:47:15,988 --> 03:47:18,958
-- I HAVE A VERY GOOD 

6053
03:47:18,958 --> 03:47:20,560
RELATIONSHIP WITH ANGELA 

6054
03:47:20,560 --> 03:47:20,960
MERKEL. 

6055
03:47:20,960 --> 03:47:23,029
BUT ON NATO WE'RE PAYING 4.2%, 

6056
03:47:23,029 --> 03:47:26,132
SHE'S PAYING 1% OF A MUCH 

6057
03:47:26,132 --> 03:47:26,532
SMALLER G.D.P. 

6058
03:47:26,532 --> 03:47:27,033
THAN WE HAVE. 

6059
03:47:27,033 --> 03:47:29,736
WE'RE PAYING 4.2% ON A MUCH 

6060
03:47:29,736 --> 03:47:31,003
LARGER. 

6061
03:47:31,003 --> 03:47:32,438
WE'RE PAYING FOR -- I MEAN, 

6062
03:47:32,438 --> 03:47:33,840
ANYONE CAN SAY ANYWHERE FROM 

6063
03:47:33,840 --> 03:47:37,477
60% TO 90% OF NATO AND THEN 

6064
03:47:37,477 --> 03:47:38,111
WE'RE PROTECTING COUNTRIES ON 

6065
03:47:38,111 --> 03:47:41,881
EUROPE AND THEY KILL US ON 

6066
03:47:41,881 --> 03:47:42,114
TRADE. 

6067
03:47:42,114 --> 03:47:42,448
IT'S UNFAIR. 

6068
03:47:42,448 --> 03:47:44,450
IT'S UNFAIR TO OUR TAXPAYERS 

6069
03:47:44,450 --> 03:47:45,684
AND OUR PEOPLE. 

6070
03:47:45,684 --> 03:47:47,153

CHAIRMAN KIM RIGHT NOW. 

6075
03:47:53,659 --> 03:47:54,360
I HOPE IT'S GOOD. 

6076
03:47:54,360 --> 03:47:59,832
BECAUSE IF IT'S GOOD, WE'RE 

6077
03:47:59,832 --> 03:48:00,599
GOING TO SOLVE A IT. 

6078
03:48:00,599 --> 03:48:03,536

03:48:03,903 --> 03:48:06,639
IT'S UP TO THE LEGENDARY SARAH

HUCKABEE SANDERS.

A PROCESS.

WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP?

03:48:36,135 --> 03:48:36,902
IS THERE SOME ONGOING DIALOGUE? 

6105
03:48:36,902 --> 03:48:37,169

WE'RE ALSO WORKING VERY MUCH

>> I WOULD COME BACK GLADLY. 

6122
03:49:05,965 --> 03:49:07,133
YOUR PRIME MINISTER WAS 

6123
03:49:07,133 --> 03:49:07,433
FANTASTIC. 

6124
03:49:07,433 --> 03:49:11,837
WE WERE WITH HIM YESTERDAY. 

6125
03:49:11,837 --> 03:49:12,938
HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB. 

6126
03:49:12,938 --> 03:49:13,305
VERY WELCOMING. 

6127
03:49:13,305 --> 03:49:13,940
PROBABLY MADE A DIFFERENCE, 

6128
03:49:13,940 --> 03:49:14,207
ACTUALLY. 

6129
03:49:14,207 --> 03:49:15,374
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

6130
03:49:15,374 --> 03:49:18,511
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 

6131
03:49:18,511 --> 03:49:18,811

6133
03:49:19,178 --> 03:49:20,279
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 

6134
03:49:20,279 --> 03:49:20,579
PRESIDENT. 

6135
03:49:20,579 --> 03:49:22,181
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THAT FIRST 

6136
03:49:22,181 --> 03:49:22,949
INTERACTION WITH CHAIRMAN KIM 

6137
03:49:22,949 --> 03:49:24,550
THIS MORNING THAT MADE YOU 

6138
03:49:24,550 --> 03:49:25,584
DECIDE NOT TO WALK AWAY AFTER 

6139
03:49:25,584 --> 03:49:28,054
YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD KNOW 

6140
03:49:28,054 --> 03:49:30,256
WITHIN THE FIRST MINUTE IF HE 

6141
03:49:30,256 --> 03:49:30,822
WAS SINCERE? 

6142
03:49:30,822 --> 03:49:32,558
>> I'VE SAID THAT ABOUT 

6143
03:49:32,558 --> 03:49:33,960
RELATIONSHIP, I'VE SAID THAT 

6144
03:49:33,960 --> 03:49:34,293
ABOUT PEOPLE. 

6145
03:49:34,293 --> 03:49:35,494
YOU KNOW, IN THE FIRST SECOND 

6146
03:49:35,494 --> 03:49:38,063
-- I WAS GENEROUS, I SAID FIVE 

6147
03:49:38,063 --> 03:49:38,330
SECONDS. 

6148
03:49:38,330 --> 03:49:41,734
BUT IN THE FIRST SECOND, IN 

6149
03:49:41,734 --> 03:49:42,935
SOME CASES, SOMETIMES THAT 

6150
03:49:42,935 --> 03:49:43,936
DOESN'T WORK OUT, BUT SOMETIMES 

6151
03:49:43,936 --> 03:49:45,538
IT DOES. 

6152
03:49:45,538 --> 03:49:46,539
FROM THE BEGINNING WE GOT 

6153
03:49:46,539 --> 03:49:47,006
ALONG. 

6154
03:49:47,006 --> 03:49:48,173
BUT THIS MADE A LOT OF 

6155
03:49:48,173 --> 03:49:48,473
GROUNDWORK. 

6156
03:49:48,473 --> 03:49:50,176
THIS WASN'T LIKE WE WENT AND WE 

6157
03:49:50,176 --> 03:49:51,978
STARTED TALKING ABOUT -- AS YOU 

6158
03:49:51,978 --> 03:49:52,311
KNOW, RIGHT? 

6159
03:49:52,311 --> 03:49:53,880
WE DIDN'T JUST COME IN AND 

6160
03:49:53,880 --> 03:49:55,081
START TALKING ABOUT THESE VERY 

6161
03:49:55,081 --> 03:49:58,184
COMPLEX SUBJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN 

6162
03:49:58,184 --> 03:50:01,053
GOING ON FOR 70 YEARS. 

6163
03:50:01,053 --> 03:50:02,855
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS FOR 

6164
03:50:02,855 --> 03:50:06,959
MONTHS, AND, YOU KNOW, ONCE THE 

6165
03:50:06,959 --> 03:50:08,294
RHETORIC STOPPED, ONCE THEY DID 

6166
03:50:08,294 --> 03:50:09,362
A GREAT THING -- YOU KNOW, 

6167
03:50:09,362 --> 03:50:11,931
NORTH KOREA DID A GREAT THING 

6168
03:50:11,931 --> 03:50:13,098
BY GOING TO THE OLYMPICS 

6169
03:50:13,098 --> 03:50:14,533
BECAUSE THE OLYMPICS AND 

6170
03:50:14,533 --> 03:50:16,836
PRESIDENT MOON WILL TELL YOU 

6171
03:50:16,836 --> 03:50:19,538
THIS, THE OLYMPICS WAS NOT 

6172
03:50:19,538 --> 03:50:20,272
EXACTLY DOING GREAT. 

6173
03:50:20,272 --> 03:50:21,874
PEOPLE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE BEING 

6174
03:50:21,874 --> 03:50:23,476
BOMBED OUT OF THE OPENING 

6175
03:50:23,476 --> 03:50:27,679
CEREMONIES, YOU KNOW, THEY 

6176
03:50:27,679 --> 03:50:29,314
WEREN'T EXACTLY SELLING 

6177
03:50:29,314 --> 03:50:29,882
TICKETS. 

6178
03:50:29,882 --> 03:50:31,684
AND AS SOON AS THE CHAIRMAN, 

6179
03:50:31,684 --> 03:50:33,352
CHAIRMAN KIM SAID LET'S 

6180
03:50:33,352 --> 03:50:35,154
PARTICIPATE IN THE OLYMPICS, IT 

6181
03:50:35,154 --> 03:50:36,489
SOLD LIKE WILDFIRE AND WAS A 

6182
03:50:36,489 --> 03:50:37,722
GREAT SUCCESS AS AN OLYMPICS. 

6183
03:50:37,722 --> 03:50:39,425
IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS. 

6184
03:50:39,425 --> 03:50:41,393
HE DID A GREAT THING. 

6185
03:50:41,393 --> 03:50:42,561
BUT SINCE THAT TIME, PRETTY 

6186
03:50:42,561 --> 03:50:47,533
MUCH SINCE THAT TIME -- 

6187
03:50:47,533 --> 03:50:49,035
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, A 

6188
03:50:49,035 --> 03:50:49,735
DELEGATION CAME FROM SOUTH 

6189
03:50:49,735 --> 03:50:51,537
KOREA THEY CAME TO THE WHITE 

6190
03:50:51,537 --> 03:50:53,239
HOUSE, THEY TOLD ME THINGS 

6191
03:50:53,239 --> 03:50:54,273
INCLUDING WE'D BE WILLING TO 

6192
03:50:54,273 --> 03:50:54,506
DENUKE. 

6193
03:50:54,506 --> 03:50:57,777
WE HAVE ONE OF THE GREAT PEOPLE 

6194
03:50:57,777 --> 03:50:59,578
HERE TODAY, THAT THEY WERE 

6195
03:50:59,578 --> 03:51:00,980
WILLING TO DENUKE, AND ONCE 

6196
03:51:00,980 --> 03:51:01,813
THAT STARTED, WE HAVE BEEN 

6197
03:51:01,813 --> 03:51:03,082
REALLY TALKING THAT FROM THE 

6198
03:51:03,082 --> 03:51:06,552
END OF THE OLYMPICS WHEN THE 

6199
03:51:06,552 --> 03:51:08,454
WHOLE DELEGATION GAME TO SAY 

6200
03:51:08,454 --> 03:51:08,987
VARIOUS THINGS INCLUDING 

6201
03:51:08,987 --> 03:51:09,254
DENUKING. 

6202
03:51:09,254 --> 03:51:10,623
>>REPORTER:  IF I MAY, A SECOND 

6203
03:51:10,623 --> 03:51:12,158
QUESTION, IN THE DOCUMENT THAT 

6204
03:51:12,158 --> 03:51:15,628
YOU SIGNED EARLIER TODAY, NORTH 

6205
03:51:15,628 --> 03:51:16,362
KOREA AGREED TO COMMIT TO 

6206
03:51:16,362 --> 03:51:16,762
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

6207
03:51:16,762 --> 03:51:19,865
TO BORROW A PHRASE THAT YOU 

6208
03:51:19,865 --> 03:51:21,467
HAVE USED TO CRITICIZE YOUR 

6209
03:51:21,467 --> 03:51:22,335
PREDECESSORS AND POLITICAL 

6210
03:51:22,335 --> 03:51:24,369
OPPONENT, HOW DO YOU ENSURE 

6211
03:51:24,369 --> 03:51:26,539
THAT NORTH KOREA IS NOT ALL 

6212
03:51:26,539 --> 03:51:27,372
TALK, NO ACTION. 

6213
03:51:27,372 --> 03:51:29,175
>>REPORTER:  I THINK CAN YOU 

6214
03:51:29,175 --> 03:51:29,575
ENSURE ANYTHING? 

6215
03:51:29,575 --> 03:51:30,376
CAN I ENSURE THAT YOU'RE GOING 

6216
03:51:30,376 --> 03:51:32,578
TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN PROPERLY 

6217
03:51:32,578 --> 03:51:33,779
WHEN YOU SIT DOWN? 

6218
03:51:33,779 --> 03:51:35,181
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T ENSURE 

6219
03:51:35,181 --> 03:51:35,448
ANYTHING. 

6220
03:51:35,448 --> 03:51:38,017
ALL I CAN SAY IS THEY WANT TO 

6221
03:51:38,017 --> 03:51:38,350
MAKE A DEAL. 

6222
03:51:38,350 --> 03:51:39,851
THAT'S WHAT I DO. 

6223
03:51:39,851 --> 03:51:41,620
MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN DEALS. 

6224
03:51:41,620 --> 03:51:42,854
I'VE DONE GREAT AT IT. 

6225
03:51:42,854 --> 03:51:43,522
THAT'S WHAT I DO. 

6226
03:51:43,522 --> 03:51:45,057
AND I KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY WANTS 

6227
03:51:45,057 --> 03:51:47,360
TO DEAL, AND I KNOW WHEN 

6228
03:51:47,360 --> 03:51:47,793
SOMEBODY DOESN'T. 

6229
03:51:47,793 --> 03:51:48,694
A LOT OF POLITICIANS DON'T. 

6230
03:51:48,694 --> 03:51:50,295
THAT'S NOT THEIR THING. 

6231
03:51:50,295 --> 03:51:51,997
BUT IT IS MY THING. 

6232
03:51:51,997 --> 03:51:53,132
I MEAN, AGAIN, THIS REALLY 

6233
03:51:53,132 --> 03:51:55,234
COULD HAVE BEEN DONE I THINK 

6234
03:51:55,234 --> 03:51:56,636
EASIER A LONG TIME AGO. 

6235
03:51:56,636 --> 03:51:59,672
BUT I KNOW FOR A -- I JUST FEEL 

6236
03:51:59,672 --> 03:52:01,040
VERY STRONGLY, MY INSTINCT, MY 

6237
03:52:01,040 --> 03:52:02,875
ABILITY OR TALENT, THEY WANT TO 

6238
03:52:02,875 --> 03:52:04,009
MAKE A DEAL, AND MAKING A DEAL 

6239
03:52:04,009 --> 03:52:06,512
IS A GREAT THING FOR THE WORLD. 

6240
03:52:06,512 --> 03:52:08,180
IT'S ALSO A GREAT THING FOR 

6241
03:52:08,180 --> 03:52:09,482
CHINA BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE 

6242
03:52:09,482 --> 03:52:12,885
THAT CHINA HAS -- YOU KNOW, IS 

6243
03:52:12,885 --> 03:52:14,687
HAPPY WITH SOMEBODY HAVING 

6244
03:52:14,687 --> 03:52:15,621
NUCLEAR WEAPONS SO CLOSE. 

6245
03:52:15,621 --> 03:52:17,690
SO, YOU KNOW, AND CHINA WAS 

6246
03:52:17,690 --> 03:52:18,057
VERY HELPFUL. 

6247
03:52:18,057 --> 03:52:20,392
SO I THINK HE WANTS TO MAKE A 

6248
03:52:20,392 --> 03:52:20,592
DEAL. 

6249
03:52:20,592 --> 03:52:21,760
CAN ANYBODY BE CERTAIN? 

6250
03:52:21,760 --> 03:52:24,696
BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE CERTAIN 

6251
03:52:24,696 --> 03:52:31,570
SOON BECAUSE THE NEGOTIATIONS 

6252
03:52:31,570 --> 03:52:31,837
CONTINUE. 

6253
03:52:31,837 --> 03:52:32,037
OKAY? 

6254
03:52:32,037 --> 03:52:32,504
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

6255
03:52:32,504 --> 03:52:32,805
GO AHEAD. 

6256
03:52:32,805 --> 03:52:34,473
>>REPORTER:  YOU MENTIONED THAT 

6257
03:52:34,473 --> 03:52:35,440
YOU HAVE RAISED EXTENSIVELY THE 

6258
03:52:35,440 --> 03:52:36,809
ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHT WITH 

6259
03:52:36,809 --> 03:52:37,176
CHAIRMAN KIM. 

6260
03:52:37,176 --> 03:52:37,443
>> YES. 

6261
03:52:37,443 --> 03:52:38,110
>>REPORTER:  I WONDER WHAT YOU 

6262
03:52:38,110 --> 03:52:41,480
WOULD SAY TO THE GROUP OF 

6263
03:52:41,480 --> 03:52:42,915
PEOPLE THAT HAVE NO ABILITY 

6264
03:52:42,915 --> 03:52:44,383
WHATSOEVER TO HEAR OR TO SEE 

6265
03:52:44,383 --> 03:52:45,384
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, THE 

6266
03:52:45,384 --> 03:52:48,587
100,000 NORTH KOREANS KEPT IN A 

6267
03:52:48,587 --> 03:52:50,890
NETWORK OF GULAGS, HAVE YOU 

6268
03:52:50,890 --> 03:52:52,525
BETRAYED THEM BY LEGITIMATIZING 

6269
03:52:52,525 --> 03:52:54,093
THE REGIME IN PYONGYANG? 

6270
03:52:54,093 --> 03:52:54,326
>> NO. 

6271
03:52:54,326 --> 03:52:54,894
I THINK I'VE HELPED THEM 

6272
03:52:54,894 --> 03:52:57,363
BECAUSE I THINK THINGS WILL 

6273
03:52:57,363 --> 03:52:57,596
CHANGE. 

6274
03:52:57,596 --> 03:52:58,464
I THINK I'VE HELPED THEM. 

6275
03:52:58,464 --> 03:52:59,231
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN SAY. 

6276
03:52:59,231 --> 03:53:02,835
ALL I CAN DO IS DO WHAT I CAN 

6277
03:53:02,835 --> 03:53:03,002
DO. 

6278
03:53:03,002 --> 03:53:03,836
WE HAVE TO STOP THE 

6279
03:53:03,836 --> 03:53:04,770
NUCLEARATION, WE HAVE TO DO 

6280
03:53:04,770 --> 03:53:07,039
OTHER THINGS AND THAT'S A VERY 

6281
03:53:07,039 --> 03:53:07,573
IMPORTANT THING. 

6282
03:53:07,573 --> 03:53:09,108
SO AT A PERSON POINT HOPEFULLY 

6283
03:53:09,108 --> 03:53:10,609
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ASK ME A MUCH 

6284
03:53:10,609 --> 03:53:11,877
MORE POSITIVE QUESTION OR MAKE 

6285
03:53:11,877 --> 03:53:12,278
A STATEMENT. 

6286
03:53:12,278 --> 03:53:14,780
BUT NOT MUCH I CAN DO RIGHT 

6287
03:53:14,780 --> 03:53:14,980
NOW. 

6288
03:53:14,980 --> 03:53:16,182
AT A CERTAIN POINT I REALLY DO 

6289
03:53:16,182 --> 03:53:17,616
BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO DO THINGS 

6290
03:53:17,616 --> 03:53:17,883
ABOUT IT. 

6291
03:53:17,883 --> 03:53:19,585
I THINK THEY ARE ONE OF THE 

6292
03:53:19,585 --> 03:53:20,786
GREAT WINNERS TODAY, THAT LARGE 

6293
03:53:20,786 --> 03:53:22,188
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE 

6294
03:53:22,188 --> 03:53:22,555
TALKING ABOUT. 

6295
03:53:22,555 --> 03:53:23,122
I THINK ULTIMATELY THEY ARE 

6296
03:53:23,122 --> 03:53:25,191
GOING TO BE ONE OF THE GREAT 

6297
03:53:25,191 --> 03:53:31,029
WINNERS AS A GROUP. 

6298
03:53:31,029 --> 03:53:31,763
YES, SIR, GO AHEAD. 

6299
03:53:31,763 --> 03:53:32,397
GO AHEAD. 

6300
03:53:32,397 --> 03:53:33,866
>>REPORTER:  WOULD YOU EVER 

6301
03:53:33,866 --> 03:53:35,501
CONSIDER REMOVING THE SANCTIONS 

6302
03:53:35,501 --> 03:53:37,469
WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT 

6303
03:53:37,469 --> 03:53:38,503
IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION? 

6304
03:53:38,503 --> 03:53:38,737
>> NO. 

6305
03:53:38,737 --> 03:53:39,404
I WANT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. 

6306
03:53:39,404 --> 03:53:43,175
I WANT TO KNOW THAT IT WON'T BE 

6307
03:53:43,175 --> 03:53:43,475
HAPPENING. 

6308
03:53:43,475 --> 03:53:44,777
AND, AGAIN, ONCE YOU START THAT 

6309
03:53:44,777 --> 03:53:45,578
PROCESS, THEY'LL BE APPOINTED, 

6310
03:53:45,578 --> 03:53:47,580
WHICH EVEN THOUGH YOU WON'T BE 

6311
03:53:47,580 --> 03:53:49,582
FINISHED FOR A WHILE BECAUSE IT 

6312
03:53:49,582 --> 03:53:50,282
CAN'T HAPPEN SCIENTIFICALLY OR 

6313
03:53:50,282 --> 03:53:50,883
MECHANICALLY, BUT YOU'RE NOT 

6314
03:53:50,883 --> 03:53:53,185
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK. 

6315
03:53:53,185 --> 03:53:54,786
ONCE WE REACH THAT POINT, I'LL 

6316
03:53:54,786 --> 03:53:58,290
START TO GIVE THAT VERY SERIOUS 

6317
03:53:58,290 --> 03:53:58,590
THOUGHT. 

6318
03:53:58,590 --> 03:53:58,957
YES, GO AHEAD. 

6319
03:53:58,957 --> 03:53:59,324
GO AHEAD. 

6320
03:53:59,324 --> 03:53:59,624
YOU FIRST. 

6321
03:53:59,624 --> 03:54:01,894
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, DID 

6322
03:54:01,894 --> 03:54:02,895
YOU ALSO DISCUSS THE COST OF 

6323
03:54:02,895 --> 03:54:05,531
DENUCLEARIZATION AND HOW NORTH 

6324
03:54:05,531 --> 03:54:08,167
KOREA IS ABOUT TO FOOT THE BILL 

6325
03:54:08,167 --> 03:54:09,067
OR THE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS 

6326
03:54:09,067 --> 03:54:09,468
REMAIN IN PLACE? 

6327
03:54:09,468 --> 03:54:10,569
>> WELL, I THINK THAT SOUTH 

6328
03:54:10,569 --> 03:54:12,238
KOREA AND I THINK THAT JAPAN 

6329
03:54:12,238 --> 03:54:13,405
WILL HELP THEM VERY GREATLY. 

6330
03:54:13,405 --> 03:54:14,573
I THINK THEY'RE PREPARED TO 

6331
03:54:14,573 --> 03:54:14,906
HELP THEM. 

6332
03:54:14,906 --> 03:54:16,775
THEY KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE 

6333
03:54:16,775 --> 03:54:17,376
TO HELP THEM. 

6334
03:54:17,376 --> 03:54:18,878
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HELP 

6335
03:54:18,878 --> 03:54:19,944
THEM VERY GREATLY. 

6336
03:54:19,944 --> 03:54:21,080
WE WON'T HAVE TO HELP THEM. 

6337
03:54:21,080 --> 03:54:22,481
THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN 

6338
03:54:22,481 --> 03:54:25,384
PAYING A BIG PRICE AT A LOT OF 

6339
03:54:25,384 --> 03:54:26,685
DIFFERENT PLACES, BUT SOUTH 

6340
03:54:26,685 --> 03:54:28,387
KOREA WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS RIGHT 

6341
03:54:28,387 --> 03:54:29,488
NEXT DOOR IN JAPAN WHICH 

6342
03:54:29,488 --> 03:54:30,523
ESSENTIALLY IS NEXT DOOR, 

6343
03:54:30,523 --> 03:54:31,290
THEY'RE GOING TO BE HELPING 

6344
03:54:31,290 --> 03:54:37,129
THEM, AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING 

6345
03:54:37,129 --> 03:54:38,831
TO BE DOING A VERY GENEROUS JOB 

6346
03:54:38,831 --> 03:54:40,899
AND A GOOD JOB, SO THEY WILL BE 

6347
03:54:40,899 --> 03:54:41,266
HELPING THEM. 

6348
03:54:41,266 --> 03:54:41,900
YES, MA'AM, GO AHEAD. 

6349
03:54:41,900 --> 03:54:42,934
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 

6350
03:54:42,934 --> 03:54:43,235
úPR 

6351
03:54:43,235 --> 03:54:43,602
>> THANK YOU. 

6352
03:54:43,602 --> 03:54:45,003
>>REPORTER:  I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW 

6353
03:54:45,003 --> 03:54:46,004
UP ON STEVE'S QUESTION. 

6354
03:54:46,004 --> 03:54:50,409
HE ASKED YOU HOW LONG IT WOULD 

6355
03:54:50,409 --> 03:54:51,643
TAKE TO DENUCLEARIZE THE KOREAN 

6356
03:54:51,643 --> 03:54:51,943
PENINSULA. 

6357
03:54:51,943 --> 03:54:52,711
YOU SAID A LONG TIME. 

6358
03:54:52,711 --> 03:54:53,679
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 

6359
03:54:53,679 --> 03:54:54,846
>> WHEN YOU SAY A LONG TIME, I 

6360
03:54:54,846 --> 03:54:56,915
THINK WE WILL DO IT AS FAST AS 

6361
03:54:56,915 --> 03:54:58,884
IT CAN BE DONE SCIENTIFICALLY, 

6362
03:54:58,884 --> 03:55:00,619
AS FAST AS IT CAN BE DONE 

6363
03:55:00,619 --> 03:55:00,952
MECHANICALLY. 

6364
03:55:00,952 --> 03:55:03,989
I DON'T THINK -- I MEAN, I'VE 

6365
03:55:03,989 --> 03:55:04,856
READ HORROR STORIES. 

6366
03:55:04,856 --> 03:55:05,891
IT'S A 15-YEAR PROCESS, OKAY, 

6367
03:55:05,891 --> 03:55:07,560
ASSUMING YOU WANTED TO DO IT 

6368
03:55:07,560 --> 03:55:07,827
QUICKLY. 

6369
03:55:07,827 --> 03:55:08,294
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. 

6370
03:55:08,294 --> 03:55:11,564
I THINK WHOEVER WROTE THAT IS 

6371
03:55:11,564 --> 03:55:13,566
WRONG. 

6372
03:55:13,566 --> 03:55:16,068
BUT THERE WILL BE A POINT AT 

6373
03:55:16,068 --> 03:55:17,570
WHICH WHEN YOU'RE 20% THROUGH 

6374
03:55:17,570 --> 03:55:18,237
YOU CAN'T GO BACK. 

6375
03:55:18,237 --> 03:55:20,873
I HAD AN UNCLE WHO WAS A GREAT 

6376
03:55:20,873 --> 03:55:22,675
PROFESSOR FOR I BELIEVE 40 

6377
03:55:22,675 --> 03:55:28,080
YEARS AT M.I.T., AND I USED TO 

6378
03:55:28,080 --> 03:55:29,281
DISCUSS NUCLEAR WITH HIM ALL 

6379
03:55:29,281 --> 03:55:30,082
THE TIME. 

6380
03:55:30,082 --> 03:55:33,886
HE WAS A GREAT EXPERT, A GREAT 

6381
03:55:33,886 --> 03:55:35,988
BRILLIANT GENIUS, DR. TRUMP 

6382
03:55:35,988 --> 03:55:36,388
THERE AT M.I.T. 

6383
03:55:36,388 --> 03:55:36,889
IN FACT, M.I.T. 

6384
03:55:36,889 --> 03:55:39,324
SENT ME A BOOK ON MY UNCLE. 

6385
03:55:39,324 --> 03:55:41,159
WE USED TO TALK ABOUT NUCLEAR. 

6386
03:55:41,159 --> 03:55:43,596
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A VERY 

6387
03:55:43,596 --> 03:55:44,029
COMPLEX SUBJECT. 

6388
03:55:44,029 --> 03:55:45,164
IT'S NOT JUST, LIKE, OH, GEE, 

6389
03:55:45,164 --> 03:55:46,398
LET'S GET RID O THE NUKES. 

6390
03:55:46,398 --> 03:55:46,999
IT TAKES A PERIOD OF TIME. 

6391
03:55:46,999 --> 03:55:48,968
BUT THE MAIN PERIOD OF TIME 

6392
03:55:48,968 --> 03:55:50,769
THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THAT 

6393
03:55:50,769 --> 03:55:51,102
FIRST PERIOD. 

6394
03:55:51,102 --> 03:55:52,438
WHEN YOU HIT A CERTAIN POINT 

6395
03:55:52,438 --> 03:55:53,372
YOU CAN'T GO BACK. 

6396
03:55:53,372 --> 03:55:54,239
IT'S VERY HARD TO GO BACK. 

6397
03:55:54,239 --> 03:55:56,075
>>REPORTER:  AND HOW LONG WILL 

6398
03:55:56,075 --> 03:55:56,475
THAT TAKE? 

6399
03:55:56,475 --> 03:56:02,347
>> WE DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'LL GO 

6400
03:56:02,347 --> 03:56:03,047
PRETTY QUICKLY. 

6401
03:56:03,047 --> 03:56:03,314
GO AHEAD. 

6402
03:56:03,314 --> 03:56:03,515
SURE. 

6403
03:56:03,515 --> 03:56:04,048
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, MR. 

6404
03:56:04,048 --> 03:56:04,349
PRESIDENT. 

6405
03:56:04,349 --> 03:56:05,684
I WANTED TO ASK YOU AGAIN ON 

6406
03:56:05,684 --> 03:56:06,451
THE SANCTIONS CAMPAIGN. 

6407
03:56:06,451 --> 03:56:07,286
YOU ALLUDED AT THE VERY 

6408
03:56:07,286 --> 03:56:08,487
BEGINNING THAT THE CHINESE ARE 

6409
03:56:08,487 --> 03:56:10,823
NOT DOING AS GREAT A JOB 

6410
03:56:10,823 --> 03:56:11,890
SECURING THE BORDER AS THEY 

6411
03:56:11,890 --> 03:56:12,223
WERE BEFORE. 

6412
03:56:12,223 --> 03:56:14,093
YOU EXPRESSED, YOU KNOW, SOME 

6413
03:56:14,093 --> 03:56:16,528
DOUBTS WHEN KIM WENT TO SEE 

6414
03:56:16,528 --> 03:56:17,863
PRESIDENT XI, THE RUSSIAN 

6415
03:56:17,863 --> 03:56:18,830
FOREIGN MINISTER WAS IN 

6416
03:56:18,830 --> 03:56:20,165
PYONGYANG AND SAID THERE 

6417
03:56:20,165 --> 03:56:22,067
SHOULDN'T BE ANY SANCTIONS 

6418
03:56:22,067 --> 03:56:23,068
WHILE THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE 

6419
03:56:23,068 --> 03:56:24,870
UNDER WAY, AND THE SOUTH 

6420
03:56:24,870 --> 03:56:27,072
KOREANS ARE NOW TALKING ABOUT 

6421
03:56:27,072 --> 03:56:29,207
RESTORING SOME FORM OF TRADE. 

6422
03:56:29,207 --> 03:56:33,279
SO WITH ALL OF THOSE PLAYERS 

6423
03:56:33,279 --> 03:56:34,213
APPEARING TO BE MOVING TOWARD 

6424
03:56:34,213 --> 03:56:36,415
ERODING SANCTIONS, HOW CAN YOU 

6425
03:56:36,415 --> 03:56:37,582
KEEP THE SANCTIONS REGIME IN 

6426
03:56:37,582 --> 03:56:37,983
PLACE? 

6427
03:56:37,983 --> 03:56:38,984
WHAT LEVERAGE DO YOU HAVE ON 

6428
03:56:38,984 --> 03:56:39,384
THESE COUNTRIES? 

6429
03:56:39,384 --> 03:56:41,287
>> WELL, I THINK WE HAVE A LOT 

6430
03:56:41,287 --> 03:56:42,153
OF LEVERAGE. 

6431
03:56:42,153 --> 03:56:44,523
I THINK WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 

6432
03:56:44,523 --> 03:56:44,790
LEVERAGE. 

6433
03:56:44,790 --> 03:56:46,392
I DO BELIEVE THAT CHINA, 

6434
03:56:46,392 --> 03:56:47,225
DESPITE MY RELATIONSHIP WITH 

6435
03:56:47,225 --> 03:56:49,294
PRESIDENT XI, A MAN WHO I TOLD 

6436
03:56:49,294 --> 03:56:50,596
YOU I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR 

6437
03:56:50,596 --> 03:56:52,965
AND LIKE ALSO A LOT, YOU KNOW, 

6438
03:56:52,965 --> 03:56:55,267
WE'RE HAVING VERY TOUGH TALKS 

6439
03:56:55,267 --> 03:56:55,567
ON TRADE. 

6440
03:56:55,567 --> 03:56:56,568
AND I THINK THAT PROBABLY 

6441
03:56:56,568 --> 03:56:57,670
AFFECTS CHINA SOMEWHAT, BUT I 

6442
03:56:57,670 --> 03:56:59,437
HAVE TO DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO. 

6443
03:56:59,437 --> 03:57:00,973
AND I THINK OVER THE LAST TWO 

6444
03:57:00,973 --> 03:57:03,175
MONTHS THE BORDER IS MORE OPEN 

6445
03:57:03,175 --> 03:57:05,077
THAN IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST 

6446
03:57:05,077 --> 03:57:05,344
STARTED. 

6447
03:57:05,344 --> 03:57:09,848
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS. 

6448
03:57:09,848 --> 03:57:13,151
WE HAVE TO DO IT. 

6449
03:57:13,151 --> 03:57:13,986
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS, 

6450
03:57:13,986 --> 03:57:16,388
TREMENDOUS DEFICIT IN TRADE, 

6451
03:57:16,388 --> 03:57:17,589
COMMONLY KNOWN AS A TRADE 

6452
03:57:17,589 --> 03:57:17,856
DEFICIT. 

6453
03:57:17,856 --> 03:57:18,791
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS DEFICIT IN 

6454
03:57:18,791 --> 03:57:20,192
TRADE WITH CHINA, AND WE HAVE 

6455
03:57:20,192 --> 03:57:21,059
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 

6456
03:57:21,059 --> 03:57:25,464
WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO LET THAT 

6457
03:57:25,464 --> 03:57:25,697
HAPPEN. 

6458
03:57:25,697 --> 03:57:27,332
AND I THINK THAT HAS HAD AN 

6459
03:57:27,332 --> 03:57:30,169
IMPACT ON MY RELATIONSHIP IN 

6460
03:57:30,169 --> 03:57:30,969
TERMS OF THE BORDER. 

6461
03:57:30,969 --> 03:57:31,470
I DON'T THINK IT HAS A 

6462
03:57:31,470 --> 03:57:32,871
RELATIONSHIP -- YOU KNOW, I 

6463
03:57:32,871 --> 03:57:37,609
DON'T THINK IT AFFECTS MY 

6464
03:57:37,609 --> 03:57:39,344
FEELING OR MY RELATIONSHIP TO 

6465
03:57:39,344 --> 03:57:40,312
PRESIDENT XI, BUT WHEN WE FIRST 

6466
03:57:40,312 --> 03:57:42,381
STARTED, WE WEREN'T READY TO GO 

6467
03:57:42,381 --> 03:57:44,716
THAT ROUTE, AND AS WE STARTED 

6468
03:57:44,716 --> 03:57:45,884
PREPARING AND GETTING READY TO 

6469
03:57:45,884 --> 03:57:47,886
DO THAT, I THINK THAT'S HAD AN 

6470
03:57:47,886 --> 03:57:49,088
IMPACT ON FRANKLY THE BORDER 

6471
03:57:49,088 --> 03:57:50,589
WHICH IS A SHAME. 

6472
03:57:50,589 --> 03:57:51,756
BUT I HAVE TO DO IT. 

6473
03:57:51,756 --> 03:57:52,991
I HAVE NO CHOICE, FOR OUR 

6474
03:57:52,991 --> 03:57:54,259
COUNTRY I HAVE TO DO IT. 

6475
03:57:54,259 --> 03:57:55,694
SOUTH KOREA WILL DO WHATEVER IS 

6476
03:57:55,694 --> 03:57:57,396
NECESSARY TO GET A DEAL DONE. 

6477
03:57:57,396 --> 03:57:58,964
IF THAT MEANS WE CAN'T TRADE, 

6478
03:57:58,964 --> 03:58:00,866
WELL, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO 

6479
03:58:00,866 --> 03:58:01,099
TRADE. 

6480
03:58:01,099 --> 03:58:01,766
THEY'RE DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO 

6481
03:58:01,766 --> 03:58:02,000
TRADE. 

6482
03:58:02,000 --> 03:58:04,770
IF THEY THINK -- AND THEY WOULD 

6483
03:58:04,770 --> 03:58:06,171
DO THIS WITH OUR CONCURRENCE, 

6484
03:58:06,171 --> 03:58:07,740
IF THEY THINK THEY CAN DO SOME 

6485
03:58:07,740 --> 03:58:09,073
WORK BECAUSE WE'RE VERY FAR 

6486
03:58:09,073 --> 03:58:10,676
DOWN THE LINE, WE'RE ACTUALLYúV 

6487
03:58:10,676 --> 03:58:12,211
YOU KNOW, THAT DOCUMENT WHEN 

6488
03:58:12,211 --> 03:58:17,816
YOU READ IT TODAY, THAT'S FAR 

6489
03:58:17,816 --> 03:58:18,183
DOWN THE LINE. 

6490
03:58:18,183 --> 03:58:19,551
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST 

6491
03:58:19,551 --> 03:58:21,452
HAPPENED TO BE PUT TOGETHER. 

6492
03:58:21,452 --> 03:58:22,420
THAT WAS DONE OVER MONTHS. 

6493
03:58:22,420 --> 03:58:23,589
AND, AGAIN, THE RHETORIC WAS 

6494
03:58:23,589 --> 03:58:25,090
IMPORTANT AND THE SANCTIONS 

6495
03:58:25,090 --> 03:58:25,490
WERE IMPORTANT. 

6496
03:58:25,490 --> 03:58:29,194
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH ONE WAS 

6497
03:58:29,194 --> 03:58:32,264
MORE IMPORTANT. 

6498
03:58:32,264 --> 03:58:33,165
THEY WERE BOTH IMPORTANT. 

6499
03:58:33,165 --> 03:58:33,565
YEAH, GO AHEAD. 

6500
03:58:33,565 --> 03:58:34,133
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, 

6501
03:58:34,133 --> 03:58:35,968
DAVID SANGER FROM THE "NEW YORK 

6502
03:58:35,968 --> 03:58:36,201
TIMES." 

6503
03:58:36,201 --> 03:58:38,270
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD 

6504
03:58:38,270 --> 03:58:39,438
GIVE US SOME SENSE OF WHETHER 

6505
03:58:39,438 --> 03:58:41,706
THE CHAIRMAN KIM TOLD YOU HOW 

6506
03:58:41,706 --> 03:58:42,407
MANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS HE 

6507
03:58:42,407 --> 03:58:45,978
BELIEVES HE'S MADE, WHETHER 

6508
03:58:45,978 --> 03:58:47,112
HE'S WILLING TO TURN THOSE OVER 

6509
03:58:47,112 --> 03:58:48,514
FIRST, AND THEN WHETHER IN YOUR 

6510
03:58:48,514 --> 03:58:51,083
MIND YOU NEED TO DO MORE THAN 

6511
03:58:51,083 --> 03:58:55,888
WAS DONE IN THE IRAN DEAL FOR 

6512
03:58:55,888 --> 03:58:58,390
ACTUALLY DISMANTLING THE -- 

6513
03:58:58,390 --> 03:58:58,924
BOTH THE URANIUM AND THE 

6514
03:58:58,924 --> 03:58:59,458
PLUTONIUM PROCESSES, AND 

6515
03:58:59,458 --> 03:59:02,294
WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAD A SENSE 

6516
03:59:02,294 --> 03:59:05,063
THAT CHAIRMAN KIM REALLY 

6517
03:59:05,063 --> 03:59:06,565
UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT INVOLVES 

6518
03:59:06,565 --> 03:59:08,667
AND HAD A TIMETABLE IN HIS OWN 

6519
03:59:08,667 --> 03:59:09,367
MIND OF SHUTTING THAT? 

6520
03:59:09,367 --> 03:59:12,271
>> WELL, DAVID, I CAN TELL YOU 

6521
03:59:12,271 --> 03:59:12,904
HE UNDERSTANDS. 

6522
03:59:12,904 --> 03:59:15,707
HE UNDERSTANDS IT SO WELL, HE 

6523
03:59:15,707 --> 03:59:18,810
UNDERSTANDS IT BETTER THAN THE 

6524
03:59:18,810 --> 03:59:20,211
PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE WORK 

6525
03:59:20,211 --> 03:59:20,478
FOR HIM. 

6526
03:59:20,478 --> 03:59:21,513
THAT'S AN EASY ONE. 

6527
03:59:21,513 --> 03:59:24,383
AS FAR AS WHAT HE HAS, IT'S 

6528
03:59:24,383 --> 03:59:25,717
SUBSTANTIAL, VERY SUBSTANTIAL. 

6529
03:59:25,717 --> 03:59:27,352
THE TIMING WILL GO QUICKLY. 

6530
03:59:27,352 --> 03:59:29,087
I BELIEVE YOU'LL SEE SOME GOOD 

6531
03:59:29,087 --> 03:59:29,320
ACTION. 

6532
03:59:29,320 --> 03:59:31,155
I MEAN, AS AN EXAMPLE, ONE OF 

6533
03:59:31,155 --> 03:59:32,524
THE THINGS WITH THE MISSILE 

6534
03:59:32,524 --> 03:59:33,592
SITE I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY 

6535
03:59:33,592 --> 03:59:35,194
SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT, THAT IT 

6536
03:59:35,194 --> 03:59:37,563
WAS A THROW-IN AT THE END, THE 

6537
03:59:37,563 --> 03:59:37,896
MISSILE SITE. 

6538
03:59:37,896 --> 03:59:38,864
BUT I REALLY BELIEVE, DAVID, 

6539
03:59:38,864 --> 03:59:40,666
THAT IT'S GOING TO GO VERY 

6540
03:59:40,666 --> 03:59:40,933
QUICKLY. 

6541
03:59:40,933 --> 03:59:42,367
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IT'S 

6542
03:59:42,367 --> 03:59:43,368
GOING TO GO FAST. 

6543
03:59:43,368 --> 03:59:44,970
AND IT IS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL 

6544
03:59:44,970 --> 03:59:46,972
ARSENAL, THERE'S NO QUESTION 

6545
03:59:46,972 --> 03:59:47,438
ABOUT IT. 

6546
03:59:47,438 --> 03:59:50,909
YOU KNOW, I USED TO SAY MAYBE 

6547
03:59:50,909 --> 03:59:53,945
IT'S ALL TALK AND NO ACTION. 

6548
03:59:53,945 --> 03:59:55,614
BUT WE HAVE PRETTY GOOD 

6549
03:59:55,614 --> 03:59:57,382
INTELLIGENCE INTO THAT, 

6550
03:59:57,382 --> 03:59:59,785
ALTHOUGH PROBABLY LESS THERE 

6551
03:59:59,785 --> 04:00:00,451
THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY, YOU 

6552
04:00:00,451 --> 04:00:01,487
UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE BETTER 

6553
04:00:01,487 --> 04:00:02,788
THAN ANYBODY IN THE ROOM, 

6554
04:00:02,788 --> 04:00:05,123
PROBABLY LESS THERE THAN IN ANY 

6555
04:00:05,123 --> 04:00:05,556
OTHER COUNTRY. 

6556
04:00:05,556 --> 04:00:06,524
BUT WE HAVE ENOUGH INTELLIGENCE 

6557
04:00:06,524 --> 04:00:08,427
TO KNOW THAT WHAT THEY HAVE IS 

6558
04:00:08,427 --> 04:00:08,927
VERY SUBSTANTIAL. 

6559
04:00:08,927 --> 04:00:10,562
THIS IS WHY, DAVID, I ALWAYS 

6560
04:00:10,562 --> 04:00:12,164
SAY THAT THIS SHOULDN'T HAVE 

6561
04:00:12,164 --> 04:00:13,831
TAKEN PLACE SO LATE INTO THE 

6562
04:00:13,831 --> 04:00:14,098
PROCESS. 

6563
04:00:14,098 --> 04:00:14,867
WOULDN'T THIS HAVE BEEN BETTER 

6564
04:00:14,867 --> 04:00:17,970
IF IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO OR 20 

6565
04:00:17,970 --> 04:00:19,571
YEARS AGO OR 15 YEARS AGO WHEN 

6566
04:00:19,571 --> 04:00:22,708
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY 

6567
04:00:22,708 --> 04:00:24,543
ABOUT NOT HAVING A SUCCESSFUL 

6568
04:00:24,543 --> 04:00:25,010
MEETING LIKE TODAY? 

6569
04:00:25,010 --> 04:00:28,113
AND I STILL LOVE MY FIRST 

6570
04:00:28,113 --> 04:00:32,084
INTERVIEW WITH YOU, DAVID. 

6571
04:00:32,084 --> 04:00:37,689
STILL HAVE THAT INTERVIEW, 

6572
04:00:37,689 --> 04:00:37,955
ACTUALLY. 

6573
04:00:37,955 --> 04:00:38,423
YEAH, GO AHEAD. 

6574
04:00:38,423 --> 04:00:38,723
THANK YOU. 

6575
04:00:38,723 --> 04:00:39,924
>>REPORTER: [ INAUDIBLE  ] IF 

6576
04:00:39,924 --> 04:00:41,894
THERE IS A SECOND SUMMIT -- 

6577
04:00:41,894 --> 04:00:42,294
THAT'S OKAY. 

6578
04:00:42,294 --> 04:00:44,095
IF THERE IS A SECOND SUMMIT 

6579
04:00:44,095 --> 04:00:46,064
WITH CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-UN, 

6580
04:00:46,064 --> 04:00:49,568
WOULD IT BE IN PYONGYANG OR 

6581
04:00:49,568 --> 04:00:49,868
WASHINGTON? 

6582
04:00:49,868 --> 04:00:52,337
>> WE HAVEN'T SET THAT UP. 

6583
04:00:52,337 --> 04:00:53,372
WE'LL PROBABLY NEED ANOTHER 

6584
04:00:53,372 --> 04:00:53,605
SUMMIT. 

6585
04:00:53,605 --> 04:00:54,673
WE'LL PROBABLY NEED -- OR 

6586
04:00:54,673 --> 04:00:55,741
MEETING, WE COULD USE A 

6587
04:00:55,741 --> 04:00:56,909
DIFFERENT TERM, BUT WE'LL 

6588
04:00:56,909 --> 04:00:58,410
PROBABLY NEED ANOTHER ONE. 

6589
04:00:58,410 --> 04:00:59,711
I WILL SAY THIS, WE'RE MUCH 

6590
04:00:59,711 --> 04:01:01,313
FURTHER ALONG THAN I WOULD HAVE 

6591
04:01:01,313 --> 04:01:02,080
THOUGHT. 

6592
04:01:02,080 --> 04:01:03,415
I DID NOT THINK WE'D BE HERE. 

6593
04:01:03,415 --> 04:01:04,949
AND I TOLD PEOPLE, I DIDN'T 

6594
04:01:04,949 --> 04:01:06,318
WANT TO BUILD UP PEOPLE'S HOPES 

6595
04:01:06,318 --> 04:01:07,786
TOO MUCH, I TOLD PEOPLE, I 

6596
04:01:07,786 --> 04:01:08,753
THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A 

6597
04:01:08,753 --> 04:01:10,389
SUCCESSFUL MEETING IF WE GOT 

6598
04:01:10,389 --> 04:01:11,423
ALONG, WE DEVELOPED A 

6599
04:01:11,423 --> 04:01:12,524
RELATIONSHIP, AND WE COULD HAVE 

6600
04:01:12,524 --> 04:01:14,393
MAYBE GOTTEN TO THIS POINT IN 

6601
04:01:14,393 --> 04:01:16,395
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS FROM NOW. 

6602
04:01:16,395 --> 04:01:17,396
BUT IT REALLY HAPPENED VERY 

6603
04:01:17,396 --> 04:01:17,663
QUICKLY. 

6604
04:01:17,663 --> 04:01:19,498
A LOT OF THAT WAS BECAUSE OF 

6605
04:01:19,498 --> 04:01:22,568
THE FOUNDATION THAT WAS, YOU 

6606
04:01:22,568 --> 04:01:23,668
KNOW, PUT DOWN BEFORE WE MET. 

6607
04:01:23,668 --> 04:01:27,506
A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED VERY 

6608
04:01:27,506 --> 04:01:27,706
FAST. 

6609
04:01:27,706 --> 04:01:29,007
WE DIDN'T HAVE, AS AN EXAMPLE, 

6610
04:01:29,007 --> 04:01:29,707
BRINGING BACK THE REMAINS, THAT 

6611
04:01:29,707 --> 04:01:31,910
WAS NOT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 

6612
04:01:31,910 --> 04:01:32,744
WAS ON OUR AGENDA TODAY. 

6613
04:01:32,744 --> 04:01:34,513
I BROUGHT THAT UP AT THE VERY 

6614
04:01:34,513 --> 04:01:36,315
END BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAD 

6615
04:01:36,315 --> 04:01:37,015
TALKED TO ME ABOUT IT. 

6616
04:01:37,015 --> 04:01:40,319
AND I BROUGHT IT UP AT THE VERY 

6617
04:01:40,319 --> 04:01:42,087
END, AND HE WAS REALLY VERY 

6618
04:01:42,087 --> 04:01:42,354
GRACIOUS. 

6619
04:01:42,354 --> 04:01:43,522
INSTEAD OF SAYING, WELL, LET'S 

6620
04:01:43,522 --> 04:01:45,090
TALK ABOUT IT THE NEXT TIME, HE 

6621
04:01:45,090 --> 04:01:46,825
SAID IT MAKES SENSE, WE WILL DO 

6622
04:01:46,825 --> 04:01:46,991
IT. 

6623
04:01:46,991 --> 04:01:49,828
AND HE KNEW -- YOU KNOW, THEY 

6624
04:01:49,828 --> 04:01:51,997
KNOW WHERE MANY OF THOSE 

6625
04:01:51,997 --> 04:01:56,268
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE ARE, WHERE 

6626
04:01:56,268 --> 04:01:57,302
THEY'RE BURIED, ALONG ROADS, 

6627
04:01:57,302 --> 04:01:59,771
ALONG HIGHWAYS, ALONG PATHS 

6628
04:01:59,771 --> 04:02:00,672
USUALLY BECAUSE OUR SOLDIERS 

6629
04:02:00,672 --> 04:02:03,441
WERE MOVING BACK AND FORTH, 

6630
04:02:03,441 --> 04:02:03,875
THEY MOVED RAPIDLY. 

6631
04:02:03,875 --> 04:02:04,409
IT'S VERY SAD. 

6632
04:02:04,409 --> 04:02:06,612
BUT HE KNEW -- AND THAT WAS 

6633
04:02:06,612 --> 04:02:08,313
BROUGHT UP AT THE VERY END. 

6634
04:02:08,313 --> 04:02:08,913
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY 

6635
04:02:08,913 --> 04:02:10,682
GREAT THAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO 

6636
04:02:10,682 --> 04:02:10,849
IT. 

6637
04:02:10,849 --> 04:02:14,519
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE 

6638
04:02:14,519 --> 04:02:17,022
VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

>>REPORTER:  WELL, I DO WANT TO

>>REPORTER:  SPECIFICALLY THE 

6658

KIM JONG-UN IS SAYING HE'S 

6660
04:02:39,111 --> 04:02:40,212
WANTING A BRIGHTER FUTURE WITH 

6661
04:02:40,212 --> 04:02:43,015
PROSPERITY FOR HIS PEOPLE, YET 

6662
04:02:43,015 --> 04:02:43,715
WE KNOW THEY'VE LIVED UNDER 

6663
04:02:43,715 --> 04:02:44,015
OPPRESSION. 

6664
04:02:44,015 --> 04:02:45,550
YOU SHOWED HIM THIS VIDEO OF 

6665
04:02:45,550 --> 04:02:48,420
WHAT THE FUTURE COULD BE LIKE, 

6666
04:02:48,420 --> 04:02:49,921
BUT DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA 

6667
04:02:49,921 --> 04:02:53,458
SPECIFICALLY OF THE MODEL THAT 

6668
04:02:53,458 --> 04:02:55,193
HE WOULD LIKE TO GO TOWARDS? 

6669
04:02:55,193 --> 04:02:56,428
ECONOMICALLY, IS HE OPEN TO 

6670
04:02:56,428 --> 04:02:57,763
MORE ECONOMIC FREEDOM? 

6671
04:02:57,763 --> 04:02:59,364
>> IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. 

6672
04:02:59,364 --> 04:03:00,599
SO YOU SAW THE TAPE TODAY, AND 

6673
04:03:00,599 --> 04:03:02,067
I THINK THAT WAS DONE REALLY 

6674
04:03:02,067 --> 04:03:02,267
WELL. 

6675
04:03:02,267 --> 04:03:05,370
BUT THAT WAS DONE AT THE 

6676
04:03:05,370 --> 04:03:06,137
HIGHEST LEVEL OF FUTURE 

6677
04:03:06,137 --> 04:03:06,471
DEVELOPMENT. 

6678
04:03:06,471 --> 04:03:07,673
I TOLD HIM, YOU MAY NOT WANT 

6679
04:03:07,673 --> 04:03:09,741
THIS, YOU MAY WANT TO DO A MUCH 

6680
04:03:09,741 --> 04:03:10,308
SMALLER VERSION OF THIS. 

6681
04:03:10,308 --> 04:03:11,910
I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING TO DO 

6682
04:03:11,910 --> 04:03:12,210
SOMETHING. 

6683
04:03:12,210 --> 04:03:13,912
BUT YOU MAY WANT TO DO A 

6684
04:03:13,912 --> 04:03:14,312
SMALLER VERSION. 

6685
04:03:14,312 --> 04:03:19,818
YOU MAY NOT WANT THAT WITH THE 

6686
04:03:19,818 --> 04:03:21,253
TRAINS AND THE EVERYTHING, YOU 

6687
04:03:21,253 --> 04:03:22,286
KNOW, SUPER, EVERYTHING AT THE 

6688
04:03:22,286 --> 04:03:22,487
TOP. 

6689
04:03:22,487 --> 04:03:23,121
YOU MAY NOT WANT THAT. 

6690
04:03:23,121 --> 04:03:23,922
IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THEM, 

6691
04:03:23,922 --> 04:03:26,024
IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THE 

6692
04:03:26,024 --> 04:03:27,125
PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT. 

6693
04:03:27,125 --> 04:03:28,193
THEY MAY NOT WANT THAT. 

6694
04:03:28,193 --> 04:03:29,027
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT TOO. 

6695
04:03:29,027 --> 04:03:31,096
BUT THAT WAS A VERSION OF WHAT 

6696
04:03:31,096 --> 04:03:33,799
COULD HAPPEN, WHAT COULD TAKE 

6697
04:03:33,799 --> 04:03:34,666
PLACE. 

6698
04:03:34,666 --> 04:03:36,501
AS AN EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE GREAT 

6699
04:03:36,501 --> 04:03:37,069
BEACHES. 

6700
04:03:37,069 --> 04:03:38,303
YOU SEE THAT WHENEVER THEY'RE 

6701
04:03:38,303 --> 04:03:39,504
EXPLODING THEIR CANNONS INTO 

6702
04:03:39,504 --> 04:03:40,672
THE OCEAN, RIGHT? 

6703
04:03:40,672 --> 04:03:44,242
I SAID, BOY, LOOK AT THAT VIEW, 

6704
04:03:44,242 --> 04:03:45,210
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE A GREAT 

6705
04:03:45,210 --> 04:03:45,443
CONDO. 

6706
04:03:45,443 --> 04:03:46,311
I EXPLAINED, INSTEAD OF DOING 

6707
04:03:46,311 --> 04:03:48,013
THAT, YOU COULD HAVE THE BEST 

6708
04:03:48,013 --> 04:03:49,047
HOTELS IN THE WORLD RIGHT 

6709
04:03:49,047 --> 04:03:49,280
THERE. 

6710
04:03:49,280 --> 04:03:51,016
THINK OF IT FROM A REAL ESTATE 

6711
04:03:51,016 --> 04:03:51,416
PERSPECTIVE. 

6712
04:03:51,416 --> 04:03:52,217
VU SOUTH KOREA, YOU HAVE CHINA, 

6713
04:03:52,217 --> 04:03:53,418
AND THEY -- YOU HAVE SOUTH 

6714
04:03:53,418 --> 04:03:56,822
KOREA, YOU HAVE CHINA AND THEY 

6715
04:03:56,822 --> 04:03:58,523
OWN THE LAND IN THE MIDDLE. 

6716
04:03:58,523 --> 04:03:58,990
IT'S GREAT, RIGHT? 

6717
04:03:58,990 --> 04:04:00,459
I TOLD HIM, I SAID, YOU MAY NOT 

6718
04:04:00,459 --> 04:04:01,626
WANT TO DO WHAT'S THERE, YOU 

6719
04:04:01,626 --> 04:04:04,696
MAY WANT TO DO A SMALLER 

6720
04:04:04,696 --> 04:04:05,664
VERSION OF IT, AND THAT COULD 

6721
04:04:05,664 --> 04:04:08,266
BE, ALTHOUGH, I TELL YOU WHAT, 

6722
04:04:08,266 --> 04:04:09,801
HE LOOKED AT THAT TAPE, HE 

6723

AMOUNT. 

6767

PROPAGANDA TO SHOW HIM -- 

6795
04:06:08,386 --> 04:06:09,855
>> NO, I'M NOT CONCERNED AT

ALL. 

6797
04:06:10,055 --> 04:06:15,827
WE COULD USE THAT VIDEO FOR 

6798
04:06:15,827 --> 04:06:16,928
OTHER COUNTRIES.

CONCESSIONS YOU GOT FROM KIM, 

6844

THE RETURN OF REMAINS AND THE 

6845
04:07:30,201 --> 04:07:31,803
DESTRUCTION OF THE NUCLEAR 

6846
04:07:31,803 --> 04:07:33,404

6847
04:07:33,404 --> 04:07:33,604
-- 

6848
04:07:33,604 --> 04:07:34,205

I KNOW YOU SAID THE LAST THING 

6851
04:07:36,741 --> 04:07:38,343
WAS AN ADD-ON, IT WASN'T IN THE 

6852
04:07:38,343 --> 04:07:39,910
AGREEMENT BUT HE GAVE YOU HIS 

6853
04:07:39,910 --> 04:07:40,111
WORD. 

6854
04:07:40,111 --> 04:07:41,112
IF HE DOESN'T FOLLOW THROUGH ON 

6855
04:07:41,112 --> 04:07:42,347
THESE THINGS, WHAT ARE YOU 

6856
04:07:42,347 --> 04:07:44,649
PREPARED  TO DO IN RESPONSE, 

6857
04:07:44,649 --> 04:07:46,751
AND WILL YOU LOSE FAITH IN THIS 

6858
04:07:46,751 --> 04:07:47,051
PROCESS? 

6859
04:07:47,051 --> 04:07:47,284
>> NO. 

6860
04:07:47,284 --> 04:07:48,320
I THINK HE'LL DO IT. 

6861
04:07:48,320 --> 04:07:49,688
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT, 

6862
04:07:49,688 --> 04:07:50,822
OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T BE DOING 

6863
04:07:50,822 --> 04:07:51,055
THIS. 

6864
04:07:51,055 --> 04:07:53,024
I REALLY BELIEVE -- AND IT WAS 

6865
04:07:53,024 --> 04:07:53,925
REALLY THE ENGINE TESTING SITE 

6866
04:07:53,925 --> 04:07:57,128
IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE OTHER 

6867
04:07:57,128 --> 04:07:58,096
THINGS THAT THEY'VE AGREED TO 

6868
04:07:58,096 --> 04:08:01,199
DO, IT WAS -- THEY HAVE A VERY 

6869
04:08:01,199 --> 04:08:02,300
POWERFUL ENGINE TESTING SITE 

6870
04:08:02,300 --> 04:08:03,802
THAT, AGAIN, WE'RE ABLE TO SEE 

6871
04:08:03,802 --> 04:08:07,706
BECAUSE OF THE HEAT THAT THEY 

6872
04:08:07,706 --> 04:08:08,973
-- THAT IT EMITS. 

6873
04:08:08,973 --> 04:08:10,241
AND, YEAH, I'M ABLE TO -- I'M 

6874
04:08:10,241 --> 04:08:11,710
VERY HAPPY -- I'LL TELL YOU 

6875
04:08:11,710 --> 04:08:13,545
WHAT, I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THOSE 

6876
04:08:13,545 --> 04:08:14,579
TWO POINT, THE TWO POINTS YOU 

6877
04:08:14,579 --> 04:08:15,413
MENTIONED, BUT I THINK YOU 

6878
04:08:15,413 --> 04:08:17,048
MIGHT BE REFERRING TO THE THING 

6879
04:08:17,048 --> 04:08:19,918
THAT'S NOT IN WHICH IS THE 

6880
04:08:19,918 --> 04:08:20,385
ENGINE TESTING SITE. 

6881
04:08:20,385 --> 04:08:21,953
I THINK HONESTLY HE'S GOING TO 

6882
04:08:21,953 --> 04:08:22,553
DO THESE THINGS. 

6883
04:08:22,553 --> 04:08:22,953
I MAY BE WRONG. 

6884
04:08:22,953 --> 04:08:24,889
I MEAN, I MAY STAND BEFORE YOU 

6885
04:08:24,889 --> 04:08:27,759
IN SIX MONTHS AND SAY, HEY, I 

6886
04:08:27,759 --> 04:08:28,059
WAS WRONG. 

6887
04:08:28,059 --> 04:08:29,661
I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL EVER ADMIT 

6888
04:08:29,661 --> 04:08:34,499
THAT, BUT I'LL FIND SOME KIND 

6889
04:08:34,499 --> 04:08:35,533
OF AN EXCUSE. 

6890
04:08:35,533 --> 04:08:37,102
ONE MORE. 

6891
04:08:37,102 --> 04:08:37,369
COME ON. 

6892

TO ACCELERATE THE PROCESS TO 

6908
04:09:02,027 --> 04:09:02,860
ESTABLISH THE LONG-TERM PACE 

6909
04:09:02,860 --> 04:09:03,161
MECHANISM? 

6910
04:09:03,161 --> 04:09:03,795
>> WELL, MY EXPECTATION ABOUT 

6911
04:09:03,795 --> 04:09:05,764
CHINA IS THAT CHINA IS A GREAT 

6912
04:09:05,764 --> 04:09:08,199

SHORTLY, MAYBE EVEN BEFORE I

LAND. 

6921
04:09:18,243 --> 04:09:20,245
AND I HAVE TO SAY -- YOU KNOW, 

6922
04:09:20,245 --> 04:09:25,650
AND THE UNITED STATES IS A 

6923
04:09:25,650 --> 04:09:26,383
GREAT COUNTRY. 

6924
04:09:26,383 --> 04:09:28,386
AND WE HAVE SET RECORDS 

6925
04:09:28,386 --> 04:09:30,155
ECONOMICALLY, OVER $7 TRILLION 

6926
04:09:30,155 --> 04:09:32,424
IN NET WORTH ADDITION TO WHAT 

6927
04:09:32,424 --> 04:09:33,458

6928
04:09:33,458 --> 04:09:34,759
TWICE THE SIZE -- THE ECONOMY 

6929
04:09:34,759 --> 04:09:35,827
OF THE UNITED STATES -- NOBODY 

6930
04:09:35,827 --> 04:09:37,729
TALKS  ABOUT THIS BECAUSE YOU 

6931
04:09:37,729 --> 04:09:39,397
DO HEAR A LOT ABOUT CHINA, 

6932
04:09:39,397 --> 04:09:40,899
RIGHTFULLY SO, BUT THE UNITED 

6933

6934
04:09:43,401 --> 04:09:45,236

04:10:36,754 --> 04:10:37,021
SHORTLY. 

6974
04:10:37,021 --> 04:10:39,023
>>REPORTER:  IF I MAY ASK 

6975
04:10:39,023 --> 04:10:39,590
ANOTHER QUESTION. 

6976
04:10:39,590 --> 04:10:40,658
IN SIGNING THE PEACE TREATY, DO 

6977
04:10:40,658 --> 04:10:43,761
YOU HOPE TO -- DO YOU PLAN TO 

6978
04:10:43,761 --> 04:10:45,230
WORK THIS OUT WITH NORTH 

6979
04:10:45,230 --> 04:10:46,698
KOREA'S CHAIRMAN KIM ONLY OR 

6980
04:10:46,698 --> 04:10:49,534
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE 

6981
04:10:49,534 --> 04:10:51,302
INVOLVEMENT OF SOUTH KOREA AND 

6982
04:10:51,302 --> 04:10:52,370
CHINA AS THE SIGNIFICANT 

6983
04:10:52,370 --> 04:10:52,603
NATORY? 

6984
04:10:52,603 --> 04:10:54,906
>> I'D LIKE TO HAVE THEM 

6985
04:10:54,906 --> 04:10:55,273
INVOLVED ALSO. 

6986
04:10:55,273 --> 04:10:56,374
THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER 

6987
04:10:56,374 --> 04:10:57,442
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO OR LEGALLY 

6988
04:10:57,442 --> 04:10:58,643
WHETHER WE HAVE TO, I DON'T 

6989
04:10:58,643 --> 04:10:58,843
CARE. 

6990
04:10:58,843 --> 04:11:00,144
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT TO 

6991
04:11:00,144 --> 04:11:08,453
HAVE CHINA INVOLVED AND ALSO 

6992
04:11:08,453 --> 04:11:08,786
SOUTH KOREA. 

6993
04:11:08,786 --> 04:11:09,654
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU. 

6994
04:11:09,654 --> 04:11:09,921
>> WHAT? 

6995
04:11:09,921 --> 04:11:10,855
>>REPORTER: [ INAUDIBLE  ] 

6996
04:11:10,855 --> 04:11:12,757
>> MIKE, DO THEY HAVE A 

6997
04:11:12,757 --> 04:11:13,057
TRANSCRIPT? 

6998
04:11:13,057 --> 04:11:13,825
THEY PROBABLY HAVE A ROUGH 

6999
04:11:13,825 --> 04:11:17,929
TRANSCRIPT WHICH YOU CAN GIVE 

7000
04:11:17,929 --> 04:11:18,529
IF YOU HAVE ONE. 

7001
04:11:18,529 --> 04:11:19,096
>>REPORTER: [ INAUDIBLE  ] 

7002
04:11:19,096 --> 04:11:20,664
>> NO, THEY DIDN'T RECORD IT. 

7003
04:11:20,664 --> 04:11:22,700
I DON'T THINK THEY RECORDED IT. 

7004
04:11:22,700 --> 04:11:23,667
ARE THERE ANY RECORDINGS OF IT? 

7005
04:11:23,667 --> 04:11:26,870
I WISH THERE WERE BECAUSE IT IS 

7006
04:11:26,870 --> 04:11:27,304
INTERESTING STUFF. 

7007
04:11:27,304 --> 04:11:28,172
>>REPORTER: [ INAUDIBLE  ] 

7008
04:11:28,172 --> 04:11:29,173
>> IT I DON'T. 

7009
04:11:29,173 --> 04:11:30,842
WE PROBABLY HAVE SOME NOTES OR 

7010
04:11:30,842 --> 04:11:34,646
SOMETHING, BUT THEY HAVE 

7011
04:11:34,646 --> 04:11:36,247
ACTUALLY DETAILED NOTES I WOULD 

7012
04:11:36,247 --> 04:11:37,348
IMAGINE. 

7013
04:11:37,348 --> 04:11:39,450
BUT WE HAD A GREAT 

7014
04:11:39,450 --> 04:11:42,353
CONVERSATION. 

7015
04:11:42,353 --> 04:11:45,156
IT WAS A VERY HEART FELT 

7016
04:11:45,156 --> 04:11:45,489
CONVERSATION. 

7017
04:11:45,489 --> 04:11:46,290
>>REPORTER: [ INAUDIBLE  ] 

7018
04:11:46,290 --> 04:11:47,291
>> I DON'T HAVE TO VERIFY 

7019
04:11:47,291 --> 04:11:48,860
BECAUSE I HAVE ONE OF THE GREAT 

7020
04:11:48,860 --> 04:11:56,100
MEMORIES OF ALL TIME, SO I 

7021
04:11:56,100 --> 04:11:56,800
DON'T HAVE TO. 

7022
04:11:56,800 --> 04:11:57,001
OKAY? 

7023
04:11:57,001 --> 04:11:57,568
>>REPORTER: [ INAUDIBLE  ] 

7024
04:11:57,568 --> 04:11:57,835
>> YEAH. 

7025
04:11:57,835 --> 04:12:00,471
BUT I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT. 

7026
04:12:00,471 --> 04:12:06,144
BUT WHAT WE DID IS WE'VE HAD 

7027
04:12:06,144 --> 04:12:08,246
NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS, WE'VE HAD 

7028
04:12:08,246 --> 04:12:09,079
VERY IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS 

7029
04:12:09,079 --> 04:12:09,747
ESTABLISHED AT MIKE'S LEVEL AND 

7030
04:12:09,747 --> 04:12:11,014
OTHER LEVELS, IN FACT, A COUPLE 

7031
04:12:11,014 --> 04:12:12,617
OF PEOPLE ARE HERE FROM -- AS 

7032
04:12:12,617 --> 04:12:13,684
YOU KNOW, FROM NORTH KOREA. 

7033
04:12:13,684 --> 04:12:14,452
THEY'RE IN THE ROOM. 

7034
04:12:14,452 --> 04:12:17,855
WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE IN THE 

7035
04:12:17,855 --> 04:12:18,155
BACK ALSO. 

7036
04:12:18,155 --> 04:12:20,291
SO WHEN WE WENT INTO THIS FINAL 

7037
04:12:20,291 --> 04:12:21,693
AGREEMENT, VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE 

7038
04:12:21,693 --> 04:12:24,162
REALLY DIDN'T GO IN COLD, WE 

7039
04:12:24,162 --> 04:12:24,729
WENT IN WITH TREMENDOUS 

7040
04:12:24,729 --> 04:12:25,396
RELATIONSHIP AND TREMENDOUS 

7041
04:12:25,396 --> 04:12:26,630
KNOWLEDGE, AND I THINK THAT'S 

7042
04:12:26,630 --> 04:12:27,632
WHY WE GOT IT DONE. 

7043
04:12:27,632 --> 04:12:29,600
SO I'M GOING TO HEAD BACK. 

7044
04:12:29,600 --> 04:12:32,136
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU FOLKS, 

7045
04:12:32,136 --> 04:12:34,739
BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE 

7046
04:12:34,739 --> 04:12:35,506
I'VE TAKEN IT EASY. 

7047
04:12:35,506 --> 04:12:37,041
SO NOW WE CAN TAKE IT A LITTLE 

7048
04:12:37,041 --> 04:12:39,377
BIT EASIER AND THEN THE WORK 

7049
04:12:39,377 --> 04:12:40,077
BEGINS AGAIN. 

7050
04:12:40,077 --> 04:12:41,346
AND I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY 

7051
04:12:41,346 --> 04:12:41,646

WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB. 

7066
04:13:01,399 --> 04:13:03,034
BUT IF YOU DON'T GET THE BALL 

7067
04:13:03,034 --> 04:13:05,436
OVER THE GOAL LINE, IT DOESN'T 

7068
04:13:05,436 --> 04:13:06,204
MEAN ENOUGH, OKAY?

[ APPLAUSE  ] 

7076
04:13:11,875 --> 04:13:22,554
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, HOW 

7077
04:13:22,554 --> 04:13:22,954
DO YOU FEEL TODAY?

7078
04:13:22,954 --> 04:13:24,756
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

7079
04:13:24,756 --> 04:13:26,758
STATES TAKING QUESTIONS FROM 

7080
04:13:26,758 --> 04:13:28,559
REPORTERS AFTER A HISTORIC 

7081
04:13:28,559 --> 04:13:29,827
MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-

7082
04:13:29,827 --> 04:13:30,694
UN OF NORTH KOREA. 

7083
04:13:30,694 --> 04:13:32,730
WE'VE GOT A LOT TO BREAK DOWN. 

7084
04:13:32,730 --> 04:13:35,233
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE WAS AN 

7085
04:13:35,233 --> 04:13:36,066
HOUR AND FIVE MINUTES. 

7086
04:13:36,066 --> 04:13:37,235
THE PRESIDENT ANSWERING A LOT 

7087
04:13:37,235 --> 04:13:38,703
OF QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS 

7088
04:13:38,703 --> 04:13:40,037
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. 

7089
04:13:40,037 --> 04:13:42,440
LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO CBS NEWS 

7090
04:13:42,440 --> 04:13:43,841
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ED 

7091
04:13:43,841 --> 04:13:44,108
O'KEEFE. 

7092
04:13:44,108 --> 04:13:45,476
HE'S JOINING ME IN WASHINGTON, 

7093
04:13:45,476 --> 04:13:48,346
AND OF COURSE HERE ON SET ISAAC 

7094
04:13:48,346 --> 04:13:48,846
STONE FISH. 

7095
04:13:48,846 --> 04:13:50,748
FIRST, ED, TO YOU. 

7096
04:13:50,748 --> 04:13:51,982
THERE'S A LOT TO UNRAVEL HERE. 

7097
04:13:51,982 --> 04:13:53,250
AS WE SAID, THE PRESIDENT SPOKE 

7098
04:13:53,250 --> 04:13:54,752
AND TOOK QUESTION FROM 

7099
04:13:54,752 --> 04:13:55,453
REPORTERS FOR OVER AN HOUR. 

7100
04:13:55,453 --> 04:13:56,654
BUT HERE'S SORT OF I THINK THE 

7101
04:13:56,654 --> 04:13:59,157
HIGHLIGHTS THAT NEED TO BE SORT 

7102
04:13:59,157 --> 04:13:59,723
OF TALKED ABOUT. 

7103
04:13:59,723 --> 04:14:01,059
ONE, THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING 

7104
04:14:01,059 --> 04:14:01,859
THAT HE ACTUALLY MADE NO 

7105
04:14:01,859 --> 04:14:03,761
CONCESSIONS, THAT HE WAS JUST 

7106
04:14:03,761 --> 04:14:04,862
MEETING WITH THE NORTH KOREAN 

7107
04:14:04,862 --> 04:14:05,330
DICTATOR. 

7108
04:14:05,330 --> 04:14:06,931
BUT THE REALITY IS HE'S 

7109
04:14:06,931 --> 04:14:07,999
SUGGESTED TO REPORTERS THERE 

7110
04:14:07,999 --> 04:14:09,534
THAT HE WILL STOP THOSE WAR 

7111
04:14:09,534 --> 04:14:11,535
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN ONGOING 

7112
04:14:11,535 --> 04:14:14,005
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS ON THE 

7113
04:14:14,005 --> 04:14:17,942
KOREAN PENINSULA, HE ALSO 

7114
04:14:17,942 --> 04:14:19,844
TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLY REMOVING 

7115
04:14:19,844 --> 04:14:21,546
TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA, TWO 

7116
04:14:21,546 --> 04:14:23,748
HUGE CONCESSIONS ONE WOULD SAY. 

7117
04:14:23,748 --> 04:14:24,749
CERTAINLY CHINA AND THE NORTH 

7118
04:14:24,749 --> 04:14:25,917
KOREANS BENEFICIARIES IF THE 

7119
04:14:25,917 --> 04:14:26,484
PRESIDENT DECIDES TO FOLLOW 

7120
04:14:26,484 --> 04:14:26,751
THROUGH. 

7121
04:14:26,751 --> 04:14:27,552
THOSE ARE JUST TWO OF THE 

7122
04:14:27,552 --> 04:14:28,753
BIGGER HEADLINES THAT I COULD 

7123
04:14:28,753 --> 04:14:30,655
SORT OF COME UP WITH, BUT 

7124
04:14:30,655 --> 04:14:32,222
THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE 

7125
04:14:32,222 --> 04:14:32,957
COULD UNRAVEL, BUT YOUR TAKE. 

7126
04:14:32,957 --> 04:14:33,224
>> YEAH. 

7127
04:14:33,224 --> 04:14:35,193
AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT THE 

7128
04:14:35,193 --> 04:14:36,260
IDEA THAT HE'S INVITED HIM TO 

7129
04:14:36,260 --> 04:14:39,130
THE WHITE HOUSE IS A SIGN OF 

7130
04:14:39,130 --> 04:14:40,231
LEGITIMACY AND RESPECT THAT HAS 

7131
04:14:40,231 --> 04:14:41,099
NOT BEEN AFFORDED TO OTHER 

7132
04:14:41,099 --> 04:14:42,133
WORLD LEADERS AND SERNLT WOULD 

7133
04:14:42,133 --> 04:14:44,035
BE A REAL FEATHER IN HIS CAP AS 

7134
04:14:44,035 --> 04:14:44,235
WELL. 

7135
04:14:44,235 --> 04:14:46,203
AS YOU SAID, LOTS TO UNPACK 

7136
04:14:46,203 --> 04:14:46,404
HERE. 

7137
04:14:46,404 --> 04:14:47,171
I THINK AMONG OTHER THINGS, 

7138
04:14:47,171 --> 04:14:49,373
LET'S JUST SORT OF RUN THROUGH 

7139
04:14:49,373 --> 04:14:49,874
IT HERE. 

7140
04:14:49,874 --> 04:14:51,242
HE SAYS THAT U.S. SANCTIONS 

7141
04:14:51,242 --> 04:14:54,711
WILL REMAIN ON NORTH KOREA -- 

7142
04:14:54,711 --> 04:14:56,481
EXISTING U.S. SANCTIONS WILL 

7143
04:14:56,481 --> 04:14:58,783
REMAIN ON NORTH KOREA AS THESE 

7144
04:14:58,783 --> 04:15:00,351
TALKS CONTINUE AND SUGGESTED 

7145
04:15:00,351 --> 04:15:01,753
THAT HE BATTED AWAY A HANDFUL 

7146
04:15:01,753 --> 04:15:03,254
OF MORE SANCTIONS BECAUSE IT 

7147
04:15:03,254 --> 04:15:03,955
WOULD BE DISRESPECTFUL, SAID 

7148
04:15:03,955 --> 04:15:06,357
THE U.S. WILL END THE WAR 

7149
04:15:06,357 --> 04:15:09,227
GAMES, SAID THAT NORTH KOREA 

7150
04:15:09,227 --> 04:15:10,862
WILL BEGIN DESTROYING ITS 

7151
04:15:10,862 --> 04:15:11,362
MISSILE TESTING SITES. 

7152
04:15:11,362 --> 04:15:12,029
HOW THAT WOULD BE VERIFIED, 

7153
04:15:12,029 --> 04:15:14,132
HOWEVER, HE DID NOT SAY OR 

7154
04:15:14,132 --> 04:15:15,166
WOULD NOT SHARE. 

7155
04:15:15,166 --> 04:15:16,634
THE IDEA THAT THOUSANDS OF 

7156
04:15:16,634 --> 04:15:19,937
MISSING PEOPLE FROM THE KOREAN 

7157
04:15:19,937 --> 04:15:20,871
CONFLICT WILL BE RETURNED. 

7158
04:15:20,871 --> 04:15:22,773
AGAIN, WHETHEROR NOT THEY KNOW 

7159
04:15:22,773 --> 04:15:24,876
THAT THOSE THOUSANDS ARE STILL 

7160
04:15:24,876 --> 04:15:26,277
WITHIN NORTH KOREA'S BORDERS, 

7161
04:15:26,277 --> 04:15:28,946
HOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN, WHEN 

7162
04:15:28,946 --> 04:15:30,013
THAT WOULD HAPPEN WAS UNCLEAR. 

7163
04:15:30,013 --> 04:15:31,949
DID SAY THAT TALKS BETWEEN THE 

7164
04:15:31,949 --> 04:15:32,850
TWO COUNTRIES WILL CONTINUE 

7165
04:15:32,850 --> 04:15:36,354
NEXT WEEK, AND BY ROPING IN THE 

7166
04:15:36,354 --> 04:15:37,054
SOUTH KOREAN LEADER, THE 

7167
04:15:37,054 --> 04:15:37,989
CHINESE, THE JAPANESE 

7168
04:15:37,989 --> 04:15:38,823
UNDOUBTEDLY THEY'LL REMAIN 

7169
04:15:38,823 --> 04:15:40,858
ENGAGED IN ALL OF THIS AS WELL 

7170
04:15:40,858 --> 04:15:41,959
SUGGESTED HE WOULD VISIT 

7171
04:15:41,959 --> 04:15:43,461
PYONGYANG AT SOME POINT DOWN 

7172
04:15:43,461 --> 04:15:44,762
THE ROAD, AND DID EXTEND THAT 

7173
04:15:44,762 --> 04:15:48,032
INVITE TO CHAIRMAN KIM TO VISIT 

7174
04:15:48,032 --> 04:15:48,465
THE WHITE HOUSE. 

7175
04:15:48,465 --> 04:15:49,233
AND ADMITTED DENUCLEARIZATION 

7176
04:15:49,233 --> 04:15:50,968
WILL TAKE A LONG TIME, SAYING 

7177
04:15:50,968 --> 04:15:52,236
THAT SCIENTIFICALLY HE'S BEEN 

7178
04:15:52,236 --> 04:15:53,938
TOLD IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME, 

7179
04:15:53,938 --> 04:15:55,973
BUT LATER SUGGESTED IT COULD GO 

7180
04:15:55,973 --> 04:15:57,174
PRETTY FAST. 

7181
04:15:57,174 --> 04:15:59,677
SO TAKE IT EITHER WAY YOU'D 

7182
04:15:59,677 --> 04:15:59,977
LIKE. 

7183
04:15:59,977 --> 04:16:01,279
DID SUGGEST THINGS WITH THE G7 

7184
04:16:01,279 --> 04:16:02,847
NATIONS DID GO AS BAD AS YOU 

7185
04:16:02,847 --> 04:16:06,184
MIGHT THINK, THAT IN FACT THE 

7186
04:16:06,184 --> 04:16:06,818
CONVERSATIONS WERE CONSTRUCTIVE 

7187
04:16:06,818 --> 04:16:07,151
AND CORDIAL. 

7188
04:16:07,151 --> 04:16:08,553
AND IF YOU NEEDED ANY REMINDER 

7189
04:16:08,553 --> 04:16:11,556
THAT THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT 

7190
04:16:11,556 --> 04:16:12,656
CLOSELY AND CAREFULLY CONSUMES 

7191
04:16:12,656 --> 04:16:14,192
THAT THAT IS SAID AND WRITTEN 

7192
04:16:14,192 --> 04:16:16,260
BY THE NEWS MEDIA, YOU GOT IT 

7193
04:16:16,260 --> 04:16:18,062
YET AGAIN TODAY AS HE RECALLED 

7194
04:16:18,062 --> 04:16:19,230
SPECIFIC STORIES THAT HAVE BEEN 

7195
04:16:19,230 --> 04:16:21,332
BRITT WRITTEN IN THE PAST BY -- 

7196
04:16:21,332 --> 04:16:22,934
BEEN WRITTEN IN THE PAST BY 

7197
04:16:22,934 --> 04:16:24,735
VARIOUS REPORTERS THAT WERE 

7198
04:16:24,735 --> 04:16:25,235
THERE QUESTIONING HIM. 

7199
04:16:25,235 --> 04:16:27,238
VLAD, WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK THIS 

7200
04:16:27,238 --> 04:16:28,639
WITH OUR COLLEAGUE MARK WHO 

7201
04:16:28,639 --> 04:16:30,741
TRACKS THESE THINGS CLOSELY, I 

7202
04:16:30,741 --> 04:16:31,676
CANNOT RECALL SINCE HE BECAME 

7203
04:16:31,676 --> 04:16:33,177
PRESIDENT MR. TRUMP TAKING 

7204
04:16:33,177 --> 04:16:33,978
QUESTIONS FROM EVERY NEWS 

7205
04:16:33,978 --> 04:16:35,880
OUTLET THAT SITS IN THE FRONT 

7206
04:16:35,880 --> 04:16:37,181
ROW OF THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS 

7207
04:16:37,181 --> 04:16:38,082
BRIEFING ROOM, AMONG OTHERS. 

7208
04:16:38,082 --> 04:16:38,883
THIS IS A SIGN PERHAPS THAT 

7209
04:16:38,883 --> 04:16:41,285
HE'S GOING TO BE MORE WILLING 

7210
04:16:41,285 --> 04:16:42,887
TO DO THAT OR PERHAPS JUST 

7211
04:16:42,887 --> 04:16:44,788
ASSIGNED THAT ON TODAY, A 

7212
04:16:44,788 --> 04:16:46,157
HISTORIC DAY FOR HIM FOR HIS 

7213
04:16:46,157 --> 04:16:47,058
ADMINISTRATION, HE'S WILLING TO 

7214
04:16:47,058 --> 04:16:49,961
ENGAGE THE PRESS A LITTLE MORE 

7215
04:16:49,961 --> 04:16:50,294
THAN USUAL. 

7216
04:16:50,294 --> 04:16:51,896
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, CLEARLY THE 

7217
04:16:51,896 --> 04:16:53,130
PRESIDENT FEELING MUCH MORE 

7218
04:16:53,130 --> 04:16:54,732
COMFORTABLE, FEELING THAT HE IS 

7219
04:16:54,732 --> 04:16:56,634
IN CONTROL OF THE WHITE HOUSE, 

7220
04:16:56,634 --> 04:16:58,035
OF HIS ADMINISTRATION, OF HIS 

7221
04:16:58,035 --> 04:16:59,269
DESTINY, AND THAT IS PERHAPS -- 

7222
04:16:59,269 --> 04:17:01,239
AND THAT HAS PERHAPS LED HIM TO 

7223
04:17:01,239 --> 04:17:02,039
BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH SOME 

7224
04:17:02,039 --> 04:17:03,474
OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PRESS WHO 

7225
04:17:03,474 --> 04:17:07,378
IN THE PAST HE HAS NOT CHOSEN 

7226
04:17:07,378 --> 04:17:08,212
TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM. 

7227
04:17:08,212 --> 04:17:10,281
CBS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR AND 

7228
04:17:10,281 --> 04:17:11,515
REPORTER FOR THE AP WHO COVERS 

7229
04:17:11,515 --> 04:17:13,484
THE WHITE HOUSE ZEKE MILLER 

7230
04:17:13,484 --> 04:17:14,152
JOINS ME ON THE TELEPHONE. 

7231
04:17:14,152 --> 04:17:15,586
ZEKE, YOU WERE IN THAT ROOM 

7232
04:17:15,586 --> 04:17:17,588
WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS TAKING 

7233
04:17:17,588 --> 04:17:17,888
QUESTIONS. 

7234
04:17:17,888 --> 04:17:20,291
I MEAN, AGAIN, THIS WAS A LONG 

7235
04:17:20,291 --> 04:17:26,931
PRESS CONFERENCE, AN HOUR AND 

7236
04:17:26,931 --> 04:17:27,531
FIVE MINUTES, YOUR TAKEAWAYS. 

7237
04:17:27,531 --> 04:17:35,006
>> THIS EPITOMIZED THE 

7238
04:17:35,006 --> 04:17:35,306
PRESIDENT. 

7239
04:17:35,306 --> 04:17:38,175
THE PRESIDENT MEETS -- THE 

7240
04:17:38,175 --> 04:17:39,777
PRESIDENT ON THE STAGE FOR A 

7241
04:17:39,777 --> 04:17:41,345
YEAR AND A HALF, IN AMERICAN 

7242
04:17:41,345 --> 04:17:44,515
LIFE FOR THREE YEARS, BEEN IN 

7243
04:17:44,515 --> 04:17:45,883
OUR LIVING ROOMS AND TVs FOR 

7244
04:17:45,883 --> 04:17:46,349
TWO DECADES. 

7245
04:17:46,349 --> 04:17:47,985
THIS IS THE DEAL MAKER THAT 

7246
04:17:47,985 --> 04:17:49,287
SAID HE ALONE COULD FIX IT, 

7247
04:17:49,287 --> 04:17:51,989
GETTING IN THE ROOM WITH KIM 

7248
04:17:51,989 --> 04:17:53,958
JONG-UN, THIS AUTO KRAT AND 

7249
04:17:53,958 --> 04:17:58,462
TRYING TO CUT THIS AGREEMENT TO 

7250
04:17:58,462 --> 04:17:59,530
BRING BACK THIS INDETRACTABLE 

7251
04:17:59,530 --> 04:18:00,064
GLOBAL ISSUE. 

7252
04:18:00,064 --> 04:18:01,132
THE QUESTION IS DID HE 

7253
04:18:01,132 --> 04:18:01,732
ACCOMPLISH THAT? 

7254
04:18:01,732 --> 04:18:03,267
THE DEVIL IS IN DETAILS THERE. 

7255
04:18:03,267 --> 04:18:04,034
THERE ARE A LOT OF INDICATIONS 

7256
04:18:04,034 --> 04:18:05,336
THAT IN FACT THAT'S WHAT THE 

7257
04:18:05,336 --> 04:18:06,737
PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO 

7258
04:18:06,737 --> 04:18:07,705
ACCOMPLISH, BUT CERTAINLY FROM 

7259
04:18:07,705 --> 04:18:09,040
HIS PUBLIC DEMEANOR HERE IN 

7260
04:18:09,040 --> 04:18:10,641
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, THIS IS 

7261
04:18:10,641 --> 04:18:11,776
-- YOU KNOW, IT SEEMED THIS -- 

7262
04:18:11,776 --> 04:18:13,477
IT SEEMED TO BE ONE OF THE BEST 

7263
04:18:13,477 --> 04:18:17,281
DAYS IF NOT THE BEST DAY OF HIS 

7264
04:18:17,281 --> 04:18:19,083
PRESIDENCY, SORT OF FREE-FORM 

7265
04:18:19,083 --> 04:18:19,817
PRESS CONFERENCE, TAKING 

7266
04:18:19,817 --> 04:18:21,052
QUESTIONS LIKE HE HASN'T SINCE 

7267
04:18:21,052 --> 04:18:22,819
THE VERY EARLIEST DAYS OF THE 

7268
04:18:22,819 --> 04:18:23,687
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, MAYBE 

7269
04:18:23,687 --> 04:18:27,658
2015, IT FELT HE WAS LOOSE, HE 

7270
04:18:27,658 --> 04:18:28,325
WAS HAPPY, COMFORTABLE, FEELING 

7271
04:18:28,325 --> 04:18:30,361
LIKE HE WAS -- HE IS REALLY 

7272
04:18:30,361 --> 04:18:31,829
CONTROLLING HIS OWN DESTINY 

7273
04:18:31,829 --> 04:18:32,029
HERE. 

7274
04:18:32,029 --> 04:18:33,664
>> YOU KNOW, ZEKE, I MEAN, 

7275
04:18:33,664 --> 04:18:34,998
AGAIN, IF YOU JUST GO BACK AND 

7276
04:18:34,998 --> 04:18:37,935
WE WILL OBVIOUSLY OVER THE 

7277
04:18:37,935 --> 04:18:39,737
COURSE OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF

7278
04:18:39,737 --> 04:18:40,738
HOURS BE HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF 

7279
04:18:40,738 --> 04:18:41,505
THE STATEMETS THE PRESIDENT 

7280
04:18:41,505 --> 04:18:43,874
MADE, SOME OF THE ANSWERS THAT 

7281
04:18:43,874 --> 04:18:44,976
HE GAVE TO REPORTERS THERE, 

7282
04:18:44,976 --> 04:18:47,778
BUT, AGAIN, THE IDEA THAT THE 

7283
04:18:47,778 --> 04:18:50,381
U.S. WILL STOP MILITARY 

7284
04:18:50,381 --> 04:18:51,582
EXERCISES ON THE KOREAN 

7285
04:18:51,582 --> 04:18:52,216
PENINSULA IN THE REGION, 

7286
04:18:52,216 --> 04:18:53,384
PLEDGES TO REMOVE TROOPS AT 

7287
04:18:53,384 --> 04:18:56,287
SOME POINT SAYING THEY COST 

7288
04:18:56,287 --> 04:18:58,022
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, THAT IT'S 

7289
04:18:58,022 --> 04:18:59,056
VERY EXPENSIVE, NO NEW 

7290
04:18:59,056 --> 04:19:00,558
SANCTIONS IN PLACE, AND ALL WE 

7291
04:19:00,558 --> 04:19:06,063
ARE GETTING APPEARS TO BE WHAT 

7292
04:19:06,063 --> 04:19:07,431
IS IN THIS DOCUMENT, THIS 

7293
04:19:07,431 --> 04:19:10,901
DOCUMENT WHICH IN EFFECT IS A 

7294
04:19:10,901 --> 04:19:12,536
VAGUE PROMISE TO DENUCLEARIZE 

7295
04:19:12,536 --> 04:19:13,370
AT SOME POINT. 

7296
04:19:13,370 --> 04:19:14,271
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 

7297
04:19:14,271 --> 04:19:18,476
YOU KNOW, IF THIS DOCUMENT WERE 

7298
04:19:18,476 --> 04:19:19,777
TO BE COMPLETELY AND FULLY 

7299
04:19:19,777 --> 04:19:21,078
EXECUTED, TO ITS FULLEST 

7300
04:19:21,078 --> 04:19:22,112
CONCLUSION, THIS WOULD BE A 

7301
04:19:22,112 --> 04:19:23,180
MASSIVE SUCCESS BY THE 

7302
04:19:23,180 --> 04:19:23,480
PRESIDENT. 

7303
04:19:23,480 --> 04:19:24,915
IF NORTH KOREA WERE TO GIVE UP 

7304
04:19:24,915 --> 04:19:26,684
ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS, HOWEVER 

7305
04:19:26,684 --> 04:19:28,285
LONG THAT PROCESS WOULD BE, 

7306
04:19:28,285 --> 04:19:29,587
MASSIVE FOREIGN POLICY FOR THIS 

7307
04:19:29,587 --> 04:19:31,188
PRESIDENT, NOBODY DISPUTES 

7308
04:19:31,188 --> 04:19:31,388
THAT. 

7309
04:19:31,388 --> 04:19:32,490
BUT SIGNING A DOCUMENT IS VERY 

7310
04:19:32,490 --> 04:19:33,190
DIFFERENT FROM ACTUALLY 

7311
04:19:33,190 --> 04:19:34,558
ACCOMPLISHING THAT GOAL, AND 

7312
04:19:34,558 --> 04:19:36,127
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE IS 

7313
04:19:36,127 --> 04:19:39,430
ELEVATED KIM JONG-UN, ELEVATED 

7314
04:19:39,430 --> 04:19:41,632
NORTH KOREA ON THE 

7315
04:19:41,632 --> 04:19:44,035
INTERNATIONAL STAGE, ENDING 

7316
04:19:44,035 --> 04:19:45,302
GENERATIONS OF ISOLATION FOR 

7317
04:19:45,302 --> 04:19:46,737
THAT GOVERNMENT, AND MAKING 

7318
04:19:46,737 --> 04:19:52,376
SOME KEY SANCTIONS THAT ARE 

7319
04:19:52,376 --> 04:19:53,777
GOING TO RANKLE KEY U.S. ALLIES 

7320
04:19:53,777 --> 04:19:54,979
AND AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE 

7321
04:19:54,979 --> 04:19:58,482
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT SOUTH 

7322
04:19:58,482 --> 04:19:59,416
KOREA OBVIOUSLY [ INAUDIBLE  ] 

7323
04:19:59,416 --> 04:20:02,086
OTHER ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD 

7324
04:20:02,086 --> 04:20:03,553
WHO WILL COME TO QUESTION 

7325
04:20:03,553 --> 04:20:06,691
WHETHER THEY ARE ASSURANCES BY 

7326
04:20:06,691 --> 04:20:07,391
THE UNITED STATES WILL LAST. 

7327
04:20:07,391 --> 04:20:09,593
SO FOR THE PRESIDENT -- YOU 

7328
04:20:09,593 --> 04:20:11,895
KNOW, IT'LL COME DOWN TO IS IT 

7329
04:20:11,895 --> 04:20:12,162
WORTH IT? 

7330
04:20:12,162 --> 04:20:14,265
WE HEARD HIM SAY ELEVATING KIM 

7331
04:20:14,265 --> 04:20:15,332
ON THE STAGE AND MAKING THOSE 

7332
04:20:15,332 --> 04:20:16,534
PROMISES, THOUGH COMMITMENTS 

7333
04:20:16,534 --> 04:20:17,868
ARE WORTH IT IF YOU CAN 

7334
04:20:17,868 --> 04:20:18,936
ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. 

7335
04:20:18,936 --> 04:20:22,239
IF NOT, IN SIX MONTHS, IN SIX 

7336
04:20:22,239 --> 04:20:24,975
YEARS, WE MAY BE HAVING A VERY 

7337
04:20:24,975 --> 04:20:26,477
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION LOOKING 

7338
04:20:26,477 --> 04:20:27,478
BACK AT THIS MOMENT VERY 

7339
04:20:27,478 --> 04:20:28,445
DIFFERENT AND THE PRESIDENT 

7340
04:20:28,445 --> 04:20:30,381
HINTED AT THAT SAYING HE WOULD 

7341
04:20:30,381 --> 04:20:31,615
PROBABLY TRY TO FIND AN EXCUSE, 

7342
04:20:31,615 --> 04:20:32,883
SOMEBODY ELSE TO BLAME IT ON, 

7343
04:20:32,883 --> 04:20:35,586
BUT THIS IS A MASSIVE RISK BY 

7344
04:20:35,586 --> 04:20:36,987
THIS PRESIDENT AND IT'LL TAKE 

7345
04:20:36,987 --> 04:20:40,591
SOME TIME TO SEE IF IT'LL PAY 

7346
04:20:40,591 --> 04:20:41,358
OFF OR NOT. 

7347
04:20:41,358 --> 04:20:42,526
>> IT ZEKE, STAND BY, ISAAC, 

7348
04:20:42,526 --> 04:20:42,793
STAND BY. 

7349
04:20:42,793 --> 04:20:44,962
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF 

7350
04:20:44,962 --> 04:20:46,363
THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT 

7351
04:20:46,363 --> 04:20:46,796
THIS VERY ISSUE. 

7352
04:20:46,796 --> 04:20:47,230
LET'S PLAY THAT. 

7353
04:20:47,230 --> 04:20:48,999
>> I WANT TO GET OUR SOLDIERS 

7354
04:20:48,999 --> 04:20:49,199
OUT. 

7355
04:20:49,199 --> 04:20:52,937
I WANT TO BRING OUR SOLDIERS 

7356
04:20:52,937 --> 04:20:53,838
BACK HOME. 

7357
04:20:53,838 --> 04:20:54,839
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 32,000 

7358
04:20:54,839 --> 04:20:55,840
SOLDIERS IN SOUTH KOREA, AND 

7359
04:20:55,840 --> 04:20:58,175
I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BRING 

7360
04:20:58,175 --> 04:20:58,776
THEM BACK HOME. 

7361
04:20:58,776 --> 04:21:00,778
BUT THAT'S NOT PART OF THE 

7362
04:21:00,778 --> 04:21:01,245
EQUATION RIGHT NOW. 

7363
04:21:01,245 --> 04:21:02,780
AT SOME POINT I HOPE IT WILL 

7364
04:21:02,780 --> 04:21:04,181
BE, BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. 

7365
04:21:04,181 --> 04:21:05,316
WE WILL BE STOPPING THE WAR 

7366
04:21:05,316 --> 04:21:07,685
GAMES WHICH WILL SAVE US A 

7367
04:21:07,685 --> 04:21:12,289
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY 

7368
04:21:12,289 --> 04:21:14,624
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE 

7369
04:21:14,624 --> 04:21:16,293
FUTURE NEGOTIATION IS NOT GOING 

7370
04:21:16,293 --> 04:21:17,227
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD. 

7371
04:21:17,227 --> 04:21:19,263
BUT WE'LL BE SAVING A 

7372
04:21:19,263 --> 04:21:21,798
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. 

7373
04:21:21,798 --> 04:21:23,534
PLUS I THINK IT'S VERY 

7374
04:21:23,534 --> 04:21:24,335
PROVOCATIVE. 

7375
04:21:24,335 --> 04:21:25,336
>> ISAAC, TO YOU NOW. 

7376
04:21:25,336 --> 04:21:26,871
WHEN YOU HEARD THAT, THAT I 

7377
04:21:26,871 --> 04:21:28,139
THINK WE BOTH LOOKED AT EACH 

7378
04:21:28,139 --> 04:21:29,340
OTHER AND SAID THAT WAS 

7379
04:21:29,340 --> 04:21:30,841
SOMETHING WE NEVER HEARD WAS 

7380
04:21:30,841 --> 04:21:32,376
EVEN ON THE TABLE, THE IDEA OF 

7381
04:21:32,376 --> 04:21:33,177
THE UNITED STATES STOPPING 

7382
04:21:33,177 --> 04:21:35,679
THESE WAR GAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN 

7383
04:21:35,679 --> 04:21:36,513
IN PLAY FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. 

7384
04:21:36,513 --> 04:21:39,083
WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU 

7385
04:21:39,083 --> 04:21:39,683
HEARD THAT? 

7386
04:21:39,683 --> 04:21:41,385
>> I THINK THROUGHOUT THIS 

7387
04:21:41,385 --> 04:21:42,386
PRESS CONFERENCE, AND, 

7388
04:21:42,386 --> 04:21:45,790
ACTUALLY, THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE 

7389
04:21:45,790 --> 04:21:47,491
NINE-HOUR PERIOD THAT WE'VE 

7390
04:21:47,491 --> 04:21:49,225
BEEN WATCHING THIS, I HAVE FELT 

7391
04:21:49,225 --> 04:21:51,362
JUST SO SHOCKED, AND THIS HAS 

7392
04:21:51,362 --> 04:21:54,231
BEEN SUCH A SURPRISING TURN OF 

7393
04:21:54,231 --> 04:21:54,464
EVENTS. 

7394
04:21:54,464 --> 04:21:56,667
AND I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND 

7395
04:21:56,667 --> 04:22:00,271
WHY TRUMP FELT THE NEED TO STOP 

7396
04:22:00,271 --> 04:22:00,871
THE WAR GAMES. 

7397
04:22:00,871 --> 04:22:02,239
THEY ARE SOMETHING THAT SHOWS 

7398
04:22:02,239 --> 04:22:03,473
U.S. RESOLVE IN THE REGION, NOT 

7399
04:22:03,473 --> 04:22:07,411
ONLY TO NORTH KOREA, BUT ALSO 

7400
04:22:07,411 --> 04:22:08,078
MORE IMPORTANTLY TO CHINA. 

7401
04:22:08,078 --> 04:22:09,580
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S THIS 

7402
04:22:09,580 --> 04:22:11,782
WHOLE IDEA OF TRUMP AS THIS 

7403
04:22:11,782 --> 04:22:13,284
GREAT NEGOTIATOR AND YET HE 

7404
04:22:13,284 --> 04:22:14,385
GAVE UP ONE OF THE MOST 

7405
04:22:14,385 --> 04:22:16,287
IMPORTANT CARDS WE HAVE IN THE 

7406
04:22:16,287 --> 04:22:17,288
REGION SEEMINGLY FOR FREE. 

7407
04:22:17,288 --> 04:22:19,189
SO I THINK I AM BAFFLED BY THAT 

7408
04:22:19,189 --> 04:22:20,691
AND I'M BAFFLED BY A LOT OF 

7409
04:22:20,691 --> 04:22:22,593
THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF TRUMP'S 

7410
04:22:22,593 --> 04:22:22,826
MOUTH. 

7411
04:22:22,826 --> 04:22:24,661
>> WE -- WE'VE BEEN ON THE AIR 

7412
04:22:24,661 --> 04:22:26,363
FOR ABOUT NINE HOURS NOW, SO I 

7413
04:22:26,363 --> 04:22:29,099
DON'T RECALL WHO OF OUR GUESTS, 

7414
04:22:29,099 --> 04:22:30,367
MAYBE IT WAS YOU, THAT SAID 

7415
04:22:30,367 --> 04:22:31,635
THAT SOMEBODY MENTIONED THOSE 

7416
04:22:31,635 --> 04:22:32,636
WAR GAMES AND SAID IT ACTUALLY 

7417
04:22:32,636 --> 04:22:34,338
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH NORTH 

7418
04:22:34,338 --> 04:22:35,239
KOREA OR WITH CHINA, IT'S 

7419
04:22:35,239 --> 04:22:36,373
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND 

7420
04:22:36,373 --> 04:22:37,908
SOUTH KOREA, THAT'S THE 

7421
04:22:37,908 --> 04:22:39,042
AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE WITH THE 

7422
04:22:39,042 --> 04:22:40,077
SOUTH KOREANS AND IN SOME 

7423
04:22:40,077 --> 04:22:42,112
CASES THE JAPANESE TO CONDUCT 

7424
04:22:42,112 --> 04:22:43,280
THESE WAR GAMES, AND YET THE 

7425
04:22:43,280 --> 04:22:44,248
PRESIDENT -- IF KIM JONG-UN 

7426
04:22:44,248 --> 04:22:45,716
ASKED FOR THIS AND THE 

7427
04:22:45,716 --> 04:22:49,787
PRESIDENT GAVE THAT UP FOR SOME 

7428
04:22:49,787 --> 04:22:51,021
VAGUE PROMISES TO DENUCLEARIZE 

7429
04:22:51,021 --> 04:22:52,289
AT SOME POINT, THE PRESIDENT AT 

7430
04:22:52,289 --> 04:22:54,191
ONE POINT WAS ASKED HOW DO YOU 

7431
04:22:54,191 --> 04:22:55,593
ENSURE THAT, THE PRESIDENT 

7432
04:22:55,593 --> 04:22:57,595
SAYING, WELL, HOW CAN YOU 

7433
04:22:57,595 --> 04:22:58,329
ENSURE ANYTHING, IT SEEMED 

7434
04:22:58,329 --> 04:22:58,629
REMARKABLE. 

7435
04:22:58,629 --> 04:22:58,929
>> RIGHT. 

7436
04:22:58,929 --> 04:23:00,331
I THINK HE SAID THAT HOW CAN 

7437
04:23:00,331 --> 04:23:02,433
YOU ENSURE WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO 

7438
04:23:02,433 --> 04:23:03,933
SIT DOWN YOU ACTUALLY SIT DOWN. 

7439
04:23:03,933 --> 04:23:04,200
>> YEAH. 

7440
04:23:04,200 --> 04:23:06,136
>> AND, AGAIN, YOU KIND OF WANT 

7441
04:23:06,136 --> 04:23:07,471
TO THINK, OKAY, WE'VE BEEN 

7442
04:23:07,471 --> 04:23:09,273
TALKING THIS FOR SO LONG, WE 

7443
04:23:09,273 --> 04:23:10,107
MUST BE HEARING THINGS, BUT I 

7444
04:23:10,107 --> 04:23:11,175
THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE 

7445
04:23:11,175 --> 04:23:13,811
WAS SAYING AND THE POINT HE WAS 

7446
04:23:13,811 --> 04:23:14,879
EXACTLY MAKING ABOUT HOW YOU 

7447
04:23:14,879 --> 04:23:16,780
CAN'T ENSURE ANYTHING, AND SO 

7448
04:23:16,780 --> 04:23:18,215
THEREFORE WE'RE GOING TO GIVE 

7449
04:23:18,215 --> 04:23:19,450
UP THIS REALLY IMPORTANT 

7450
04:23:19,450 --> 04:23:20,150
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIP THAT WE 

7451
04:23:20,150 --> 04:23:20,851
HAVE AND THIS VERY IMPORTANT 

7452
04:23:20,851 --> 04:23:23,387
PART OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 

7453
04:23:23,387 --> 04:23:26,290
SOUTH KOREA SO THAT NORTH KOREA 

7454
04:23:26,290 --> 04:23:27,291
MAY EVENTUALLY AT SOME POINT 

7455
04:23:27,291 --> 04:23:28,325
LATER IN THE FUTURE DO 

7456
04:23:28,325 --> 04:23:28,892
SOMETHING THEY'VE ALREADY 

7457
04:23:28,892 --> 04:23:30,895
PROMISED  TO DO BUT HAVEN'T 

7458
04:23:30,895 --> 04:23:31,095
DONE. 

7459
04:23:31,095 --> 04:23:32,195
>> ED O'KEEFE, YOU'RE STILL 

7460
04:23:32,195 --> 04:23:32,629
WITH US. 

7461
04:23:32,629 --> 04:23:34,932
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW YOU THINK 

7462
04:23:34,932 --> 04:23:35,532
HAVING COVERED CONGRESS FOR 

7463
04:23:35,532 --> 04:23:37,067
MANY, MANY YEARS, HOW DO YOU 

7464
04:23:37,067 --> 04:23:39,202
THINK THIS IS GOING TO PLAY 

7465
04:23:39,202 --> 04:23:40,570
WITH SOME CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS 

7466
04:23:40,570 --> 04:23:41,272
OF CONGRESS, BOTH REPUBLICANS 

7467
04:23:41,272 --> 04:23:42,573
AND DEMOCRAT WHO ARE GOING TO 

7468
04:23:42,573 --> 04:23:43,640
LOOK AT SOME OF THE REMARKS 

7469
04:23:43,640 --> 04:23:46,043
THAT THE PRESIDENT MADE IN THIS 

7470
04:23:46,043 --> 04:23:46,810
PRESS CONFERENCE AND SAY, WHOA, 

7471
04:23:46,810 --> 04:23:49,113
WHOA, WHOA, WE -- THE IDEA THAT 

7472
04:23:49,113 --> 04:23:51,415
WE WOULD STOP PROTECTING OUR 

7473
04:23:51,415 --> 04:23:53,817
ALLIES BY REMOVING TROOPS FROM 

7474
04:23:53,817 --> 04:23:54,919
THE PENINSULA OR STOPPING THESE 

7475
04:23:54,919 --> 04:23:56,820
WAR GAMES IS NOT SOMETHING THAT 

7476
04:23:56,820 --> 04:23:59,223
WE THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD 

7477
04:23:59,223 --> 04:24:00,024
BE SUGGESTING OR EVEN 

7478
04:24:00,024 --> 04:24:00,925
ADVOCATING FOR, ALL THAT LOOKS 

7479
04:24:00,925 --> 04:24:04,028
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD IS 

7480
04:24:04,028 --> 04:24:05,596
THAT WE'RE ABANDONING OUR 

7481
04:24:05,596 --> 04:24:07,998
ALLIES, SOUTH KOREA WHILE 

7482
04:24:07,998 --> 04:24:08,832
EMBOLDENING THE NORTH KOREANS? 

7483
04:24:08,832 --> 04:24:09,099
>> YEAH. 

7484
04:24:09,099 --> 04:24:10,634
WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE A FAIR BIT 

7485
04:24:10,634 --> 04:24:13,704
OF SKEPTICISM FROM MEMBERS OF 

7486
04:24:13,704 --> 04:24:14,071
BOTH PARTIES. 

7487
04:24:14,071 --> 04:24:17,775
BUT I THINK WE'LL SEE SOME AT 

7488
04:24:17,775 --> 04:24:19,543
LEAST MEASURED SUPPORT FROM 

7489
04:24:19,543 --> 04:24:20,010
CERTAIN REPUBLICANS. 

7490
04:24:20,010 --> 04:24:21,045
SOME OF HIS BIGGEST DEFENDERS 

7491
04:24:21,045 --> 04:24:23,914
ON CAPITOL HILL ARE ALSO SOME 

7492
04:24:23,914 --> 04:24:26,717
OF THIS REGIME'S BIGGEST 

7493
04:24:26,717 --> 04:24:28,151
CRITICS, THE NORTH KOREAN 

7494
04:24:28,151 --> 04:24:29,986
REGIME'S BIGGEST CRITICS. 

7495
04:24:29,986 --> 04:24:31,622
I'M THINKING OF ENJOYS LIKE TOM 

7496
04:24:31,622 --> 04:24:32,923
COTTON -- LIKE GUYS OF TOM 

7497
04:24:32,923 --> 04:24:34,825
COTTON OF ARKANSAS OR OTHER 

7498
04:24:34,825 --> 04:24:35,726
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE PRETTY 

7499
04:24:35,726 --> 04:24:36,593
OUTSPOKEN ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 

7500
04:24:36,593 --> 04:24:38,162
YOU DID HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY 

7501
04:24:38,162 --> 04:24:39,697
HE'D LIKE TO ENGAGE CONGRESS ON 

7502
04:24:39,697 --> 04:24:40,998
THAT, WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK 

7503
04:24:40,998 --> 04:24:42,299
LIKE, WHEN AND HOW REMAINS TO 

7504
04:24:42,299 --> 04:24:42,599
BE SEEN. 

7505
04:24:42,599 --> 04:24:45,602
LET ME JUST READ TO YOU A BIT, 

7506
04:24:45,602 --> 04:24:47,371
VLAD, FROM A STATEMENT THAT WAS 

7507
04:24:47,371 --> 04:24:49,506
PUT OUT LAST NIGHT BY TOP HOUSE 

7508
04:24:49,506 --> 04:24:50,341
DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE ABOUT AS 

7509
04:24:50,341 --> 04:24:53,143
MUCH INFLUENCE OVER THIS AS YOU 

7510
04:24:53,143 --> 04:24:54,711
AND I DO, FRANKLY IN THE WAY 

7511
04:24:54,711 --> 04:24:55,846
POLITICS WORK IN WASHINGTON 

7512
04:24:55,846 --> 04:24:56,847
RIGHT NOW, BUT I THINK IT 

7513
04:24:56,847 --> 04:24:57,748
SPEAKS BROADLY TO HOW DEMOCRATS 

7514
04:24:57,748 --> 04:25:00,751
ARE GOING TO FEEL ABOUT ALL OF 

7515
04:25:00,751 --> 04:25:02,953
THIS, AND THEY SAY IN PART, 

7516
04:25:02,953 --> 04:25:04,154
SUPPORT FROM OUR PARTNERS AND 

7517
04:25:04,154 --> 04:25:05,856
AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS WILL 

7518
04:25:05,856 --> 04:25:08,759
BE ESSENTIAL TO A SUCCESSFUL 

7519
04:25:08,759 --> 04:25:09,760
OUTCOME TO HIGH-STAKES NUCLEAR 

7520
04:25:09,760 --> 04:25:10,561
DIPLOMACY WITH PYONGYANG, A 

7521
04:25:10,561 --> 04:25:12,329
DEAL THAT PRESERVES THE STATUS 

7522
04:25:12,329 --> 04:25:15,365
QUO IN TERMS OF NORTH KOREA'S 

7523
04:25:15,365 --> 04:25:16,734
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY WHILE 

7524
04:25:16,734 --> 04:25:19,236
TRADING AWAY OUR ABILITY TO 

7525
04:25:19,236 --> 04:25:22,339
COUNTER THEIR NUCLEAR AGGRESS 

7526
04:25:22,339 --> 04:25:22,772
AND -- AGGRESSION AND PRO 

7527
04:25:29,012 --> 04:25:29,646
TO ACHIEVE AN AGREEMENT THAT 

7528
04:25:29,646 --> 04:25:30,881
LEADS TO LASTING PEACE WILL 

7529
04:25:30,881 --> 04:25:31,982
REQUIRE THE SUPPORT OF OUR 

7530
04:25:31,982 --> 04:25:32,215
ALLIES. 

7531
04:25:32,215 --> 04:25:33,083
IN ESSENCE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING 

7532
04:25:33,083 --> 04:25:34,385
HERE IS WE'RE COOL WITH THIS IF 

7533
04:25:34,385 --> 04:25:36,086
THE REST OF THE WORLD IS COOL 

7534
04:25:36,086 --> 04:25:36,386
WITH THIS. 

7535
04:25:36,386 --> 04:25:38,789
AND IF THEY AREN'T, WE'RE GOING 

7536
04:25:38,789 --> 04:25:40,057
TO HAVE A LOT OF SKEPTICISM. 

7537
04:25:40,057 --> 04:25:41,658
I SUSPECT IN THE COMING DAYS 

7538
04:25:41,658 --> 04:25:43,060
THERE WILL BE SOME BRIEFINGS 

7539
04:25:43,060 --> 04:25:44,595
FOR AT LEAST SENIOR LAWMAKERS 

7540
04:25:44,595 --> 04:25:46,130
TO LEARN A LITTLE MORE ABOUT 

7541
04:25:46,130 --> 04:25:48,532
THE DETAILS OF THIS, ABOUT THE 

7542
04:25:48,532 --> 04:25:51,135
PATH FORWARD AND POTENTIALLY 

7543
04:25:51,135 --> 04:25:52,369
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND 

7544
04:25:52,369 --> 04:25:53,237
SECRETARY POMPEO'S DIRECT 

7545
04:25:53,237 --> 04:25:54,438
INTERACTIONS WITH CHAIRMAN KIM 

7546
04:25:54,438 --> 04:25:55,339
AND HIS CLOSE-KNIT CIRCLE, AND 

7547
04:25:55,339 --> 04:25:57,007
SO WE MAY START TO LEARN A 

7548
04:25:57,007 --> 04:25:59,977
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT IN THE 

7549
04:25:59,977 --> 04:26:00,677
COMING DAYS. 

7550
04:26:00,677 --> 04:26:01,879
I WOULD ONLY ADD TO WHAT 

7551
04:26:01,879 --> 04:26:03,780
ISAAC'S CONCERN WAS THERE ABOUT 

7552
04:26:03,780 --> 04:26:04,314
THE WAR GAMES. 

7553
04:26:04,314 --> 04:26:07,618
YOU KNOW, I THINK AS MUCH AS WE 

7554
04:26:07,618 --> 04:26:08,385
ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THE NORTH 

7555
04:26:08,385 --> 04:26:10,687
KOREANS ARE GOING TO DO ANY OF 

7556
04:26:10,687 --> 04:26:11,889
THIS, WE PROBABLY SHOULD BE 

7557
04:26:11,889 --> 04:26:13,390
JUST AS SKEPTICAL THAT WE WOULD 

7558
04:26:13,390 --> 04:26:15,392
EVER REALLY CONSIDER DOING 

7559
04:26:15,392 --> 04:26:16,894
THOSE THINGS UNTIL WE SEE SOME 

7560
04:26:16,894 --> 04:26:18,528
VERIFIABLE ACTION BY THE NORTH 

7561
04:26:18,528 --> 04:26:18,796
 

7562
04:26:18,796 --> 04:26:23,367
PICKING UP THE PHONE TO SPEAK 

7563
04:26:23,367 --> 04:26:24,868
NEXT WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN -- 

7564
04:26:24,868 --> 04:26:25,803
WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN LEADER, 

7565
04:26:25,803 --> 04:26:27,271
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU CAN 

7566
04:26:27,271 --> 04:26:29,306
BET THAT THAT PHONE CALL WILL 

7567
04:26:29,306 --> 04:26:30,574
INCLUDE IS A QUESTION ABOUT, 

7568
04:26:30,574 --> 04:26:32,075
WAIT, WE'RE ENDING THOSE WAR 

7569
04:26:32,075 --> 04:26:32,309
GAMES? 

7570
04:26:32,309 --> 04:26:33,610
THAT'S PART OF OUR DEAL, NOT 

7571
04:26:33,610 --> 04:26:35,279
PART OF YOUR DEAL WITH THEM. 

7572
04:26:35,279 --> 04:26:37,014
SO I GOTTA BELIEVE THAT THERE 

7573
04:26:37,014 --> 04:26:38,715
WILL BE -- THERE WOULD BE A 

7574
04:26:38,715 --> 04:26:42,319
WHILE AT LEAST UNTIL THAT IS 

7575
04:26:42,319 --> 04:26:43,253
COMPLETELY TAKEN OFF THE TABLE. 

7576
04:26:43,253 --> 04:26:45,189
AND AS I RECALL, ISAAC, THOSE 

7577
04:26:45,189 --> 04:26:47,424
ARE ANNUAL WAR GAMES, RIGHT? 

7578
04:26:47,424 --> 04:26:48,057
THEY'RE NOT ONGOING. 

7579
04:26:48,057 --> 04:26:49,793
>> THERE ARE ANNUAL ONES. 

7580
04:26:49,793 --> 04:26:51,628
I THINK THERE ARE OTHER 

7581
04:26:51,628 --> 04:26:52,563
EXERCISES THAT THE UNITED 

7582
04:26:52,563 --> 04:26:54,765
STATES AND SOUTH KOREA DOES. 

7583
04:26:54,765 --> 04:26:55,899
I THINK THE ONES -- THERE'S 

7584
04:26:55,899 --> 04:26:57,301
PARTICULAR EXERCISES THAT THE 

7585
04:26:57,301 --> 04:27:00,170
NORTH KOREANS HAVE THE LARGEST 

7586
04:27:00,170 --> 04:27:00,503
PROBLEM WITH. 

7587
04:27:00,503 --> 04:27:01,572
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM 

7588
04:27:01,572 --> 04:27:03,807
REALLY SHOULD OR NEED TO BE ON 

7589
04:27:03,807 --> 04:27:06,610
THE TABLE TO NEGOTIATE UNLESS, 

7590
04:27:06,610 --> 04:27:08,245
AS YOU WERE SAYING, WE ARE 

7591
04:27:08,245 --> 04:27:08,912
GETTING CONCRETE DELIVERABLES 

7592
04:27:08,912 --> 04:27:09,913
FROM THE NORTH KOREANS, AND I 

7593
04:27:09,913 --> 04:27:12,916
THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT. 

7594
04:27:12,916 --> 04:27:14,150
I THINK THE SOUTH KOREAN 

7595
04:27:14,150 --> 04:27:15,052
PRESIDENT, I THINK ALSO 

7596
04:27:15,052 --> 04:27:16,320
SECRETARY MATTIS AND OTHER 

7597
04:27:16,320 --> 04:27:17,921
MEMBERS OF TRUMP'S CABINET ARE 

7598
04:27:17,921 --> 04:27:19,556
GOING TO TRY TO WALK HIM BACK 

7599
04:27:19,556 --> 04:27:20,924
FROM A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT 

7600
04:27:20,924 --> 04:27:23,560
HE SAID IN THIS PRESS 

7601
04:27:23,560 --> 04:27:23,860
CONFERENCE. 

7602
04:27:23,860 --> 04:27:24,461
>> ALL RIGHT. 

7603
04:27:24,461 --> 04:27:25,596
ISAAC, STAND BY. 

7604
04:27:25,596 --> 04:27:26,029
ONE SECOND. 

7605
04:27:26,029 --> 04:27:26,796
ED, STAND BY. 

7606
04:27:26,796 --> 04:27:29,433

WHO IS JOINING ME NOW FROM 

7609
04:27:32,536 --> 04:27:33,437
SINGAPORE WHERE HE HAS BEEN 

7610
04:27:33,437 --> 04:27:34,938
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS 

7611
04:27:34,938 --> 04:27:36,306
TRACKING THIS HISTORIC MEETING 

7612
04:27:36,306 --> 04:27:38,375

UN. 

7615
04:27:39,209 --> 04:27:39,877
JEFF, REMARKABLE PRESS 

7616
04:27:39,877 --> 04:27:40,744
CONFERENCE THERE BY THE 

7617
04:27:40,744 --> 04:27:46,650
PRESIDENT, OVER AN HOUR AND 

7618
04:27:46,650 --> 04:27:47,851
FIVE MINUTES TAKING QUESTIONS 

7619
04:27:47,851 --> 04:27:48,218
FROM REPORTERS. 

7620
04:27:48,218 --> 04:27:49,152
>>REPORTER:  YES, AN EXHAUSTIVE 

7621
04:27:49,152 --> 04:27:51,355
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WE JUST 

7622
04:27:51,355 --> 04:27:52,922
WATCHED, AND NOW THE PRESIDENT 

7623
04:27:52,922 --> 04:27:55,759
PREPARES TO DEPART ON AIR FORCE 

7624
04:27:55,759 --> 04:27:57,594
ONE, KIM JONG-UN HAS ALREADY 

7625
04:27:57,594 --> 04:27:57,961
DEPARTED HERE. 

7626
04:27:57,961 --> 04:27:59,630
SO THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT 

7627
04:27:59,630 --> 04:28:02,032
OF -- THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A 

7628
04:28:02,032 --> 04:28:03,834
LOT OF INSTANT ANALYSIS HERE, A 

7629
04:28:03,834 --> 04:28:04,501
LOT OF HAND WRINGING. 

7630
04:28:04,501 --> 04:28:06,236
I THINK BOTTOM LINE AT THIS 

7631
04:28:06,236 --> 04:28:08,172
POINT RIGHT NOW THERE IS THIS 

7632
04:28:08,172 --> 04:28:09,472
FRAMEWORK WHICH HAS BEEN 

7633
04:28:09,472 --> 04:28:10,307
SIGNED, THESE FOUR MAIN POINTS, 

7634
04:28:10,307 --> 04:28:12,776
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO 

7635
04:28:12,776 --> 04:28:14,678
SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. 

7636
04:28:14,678 --> 04:28:15,546
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT 

7637
04:28:15,546 --> 04:28:16,513
SOMETHING HAPPENING NOW NEXT 

7638
04:28:16,513 --> 04:28:18,182
WEEK. 

7639
04:28:18,182 --> 04:28:20,149
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

7640
04:28:20,149 --> 04:28:21,785
BEING ASKED ABOUT WHEN KIM JONG-

7641
04:28:21,785 --> 04:28:24,788
UN POTENTIALLY VISITS THE 

7642
04:28:24,788 --> 04:28:25,655
UNITED STATES, WHEN THE 

7643
04:28:25,655 --> 04:28:26,223
PRESIDENT WOULD POTENTIALLY 

7644
04:28:26,223 --> 04:28:29,393
VISIT PYONGYANG, BUT WE HAVE TO 

7645
04:28:29,393 --> 04:28:30,460
WAIT ON THOSE DETAILS, VLAD. 

7646
04:28:30,460 --> 04:28:31,595
>> JEFF, TALK ABOUT THE -- IF 

7647
04:28:31,595 --> 04:28:33,530
WE TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THE 

7648
04:28:33,530 --> 04:28:34,130
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WE JUST 

7649
04:28:34,130 --> 04:28:34,798
WITNESSED WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 

7650
04:28:34,798 --> 04:28:37,201
THE UNITED STATES AND MEMBERS 

7651
04:28:37,201 --> 04:28:39,970
OF THE PRESS, THIS HISTORIC 

7652
04:28:39,970 --> 04:28:41,071
MEETING THAT WE SAW UNFOLDING 

7653
04:28:41,071 --> 04:28:42,906
BEFORE OUR EYES HERE, AND YOU 

7654
04:28:42,906 --> 04:28:45,142
SAW FROM THE GROUND THERE IN 

7655
04:28:45,142 --> 04:28:46,810
SINGAPORE, THE FIRST-EVER 

7656
04:28:46,810 --> 04:28:48,745
MEETING BETWEEN A SITTING 

7657
04:28:48,745 --> 04:28:49,713
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT AND A 

7658
04:28:49,713 --> 04:28:51,715
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA AND 

7659
04:28:51,715 --> 04:28:53,016
ULTIMATELY COMING AWAY WITH A 

7660
04:28:53,016 --> 04:28:54,117
SIGNED JOINT AGREEMENT, JUST 

7661
04:28:54,117 --> 04:28:55,419
THE HISTORY IN THE MAKING THAT 

7662
04:28:55,419 --> 04:29:00,357
HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE OF THE 

7663
04:29:00,357 --> 04:29:01,090
LAST NINE HOURS OR SO. 

7664
04:29:01,090 --> 04:29:01,425
>> YEAH. 

7665
04:29:01,425 --> 04:29:02,926
I THINK THERE WERE A COUPLE 

7666
04:29:02,926 --> 04:29:04,827
THINGS TO PAY ATTENTION TO. 

7667
04:29:04,827 --> 04:29:05,829
AS FAR AS LAST NIGHT GOES, 

7668
04:29:05,829 --> 04:29:07,798
THERE WAS -- YES, THERE WAS THE 

7669
04:29:07,798 --> 04:29:10,534
THEATER OF WHAT HAPPENED, THERE 

7670
04:29:10,534 --> 04:29:14,270
WAS WHAT WE SAW FROM THESE TWO 

7671
04:29:14,270 --> 04:29:15,005
MEN, THE MULTIPLE HANDSHAKES, 

7672
04:29:15,005 --> 04:29:15,705
THAT RELATIONSHIP -- BECAUSE 

7673
04:29:15,705 --> 04:29:17,841
THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT 

7674
04:29:17,841 --> 04:29:20,611
IT SO MUCH, BECAUSE HE HAS SAID 

7675
04:29:20,611 --> 04:29:22,179
HE FEELS LIKE THAT IS SO 

7676
04:29:22,179 --> 04:29:24,715
IMPORTANT, THAT POTENTIAL 

7677
04:29:24,715 --> 04:29:26,116
CONNECTION AND HOW THAT 

7678
04:29:26,116 --> 04:29:29,219
HAPPENS, ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S 

7679
04:29:29,219 --> 04:29:29,953
THE MEETING LAST NIGHT. 

7680
04:29:29,953 --> 04:29:32,222
AND THEN MORE IMPORTANT IS THE 

7681
04:29:32,222 --> 04:29:35,125
LANGUAGE IN THE FRAMEWORK WE 

7682
04:29:35,125 --> 04:29:35,926
SEE HERE NOW. 

7683
04:29:35,926 --> 04:29:38,428
DOES IT SAY COMPLETE 

7684
04:29:38,428 --> 04:29:38,828
DENUCLEARIZATION? 

7685
04:29:38,828 --> 04:29:40,497
YES, IT DOES. 

7686
04:29:40,497 --> 04:29:41,931
IS THE WORD VERIFIABLE IN 

7687
04:29:41,931 --> 04:29:42,165
THERE? 

7688
04:29:42,165 --> 04:29:42,799
NO. 

7689
04:29:42,799 --> 04:29:45,402
AS FAR AS THE SEQUENCE OF THE 

7690
04:29:45,402 --> 04:29:47,104
POINTS GOES, SOME HAVE NOTED 

7691
04:29:47,104 --> 04:29:50,107
ALREADY THAT NORTH KOREA WOULD 

7692
04:29:50,107 --> 04:29:51,108
HAVE PREFERRED AND GOT THAT. 

7693
04:29:51,108 --> 04:29:54,645
WE TALK ABOUT THESE FIRST TWO 

7694
04:29:54,645 --> 04:29:56,446
POINTS FIRST TALKING ABOUT A 

7695
04:29:56,446 --> 04:29:58,348
STABLE FUTURE, PEACE, A PEACE 

7696
04:29:58,348 --> 04:29:59,416
REGIME ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, 

7697
04:29:59,416 --> 04:30:00,784
THOSE ARE THE FIRST COUPLE 

7698
04:30:00,784 --> 04:30:02,919
POINTS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND 

7699
04:30:02,919 --> 04:30:04,454
THEN IT MOVES DOWN TO 

7700
04:30:04,454 --> 04:30:05,322
DENUCLEARIZATION, AND THEN 

7701
04:30:05,322 --> 04:30:06,155
THERE'S THE FOURTH PINT WHICH 

7702
04:30:06,155 --> 04:30:07,824
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SO MANY IN 

7703
04:30:07,824 --> 04:30:13,096
THE U.S. AND THAT IS THE RETURN 

7704
04:30:13,096 --> 04:30:13,963
OF THESE POW/MIA REMAINS. 

7705
04:30:13,963 --> 04:30:15,098
THE PRESIDENT INDICATED AT THE 

7706
04:30:15,098 --> 04:30:16,900
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WAS A 

7707
04:30:16,900 --> 04:30:18,302
LAST MINUTE ADDITION, BUT IT'S 

7708
04:30:18,302 --> 04:30:18,969
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN 

7709
04:30:18,969 --> 04:30:22,205
TALKED ABOUT BETWEEN THESE TWO

ALREADY DEPARTED SINGAPORE, 

7729
04:30:49,266 --> 04:30:50,100
THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS, THE 

7730
04:30:50,100 --> 04:30:51,401
PRESIDENT SAYING HE'S GOING TO 

7731
04:30:51,401 --> 04:30:53,637

7733
04:30:54,905 --> 04:30:55,705
BREAK AFTER THIS HISTORIC 

7734
04:30:55,705 --> 04:30:57,941
MEETING, BUT THERE WILL BE 

7735
04:30:57,941 --> 04:30:58,608
QUESTIONS AND THERE WILL BE 

7736
04:30:58,608 --> 04:30:59,209
FOLLOWUPS, ESPECIALLY TO THE 

7737
04:30:59,209 --> 04:31:00,344
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 

7738
04:31:00,344 --> 04:31:03,246
AT THE END OF HIS REMARKS HERE 

7739
04:31:03,246 --> 04:31:04,348
THE PRESIDENT POINTING TO HIS 

7740
04:31:04,348 --> 04:31:05,148
SECRETARY OF STATE SAYING, 

7741
04:31:05,148 --> 04:31:07,584
LOOK, YOU GOTTA GET THAT BALL 

7742
04:31:07,584 --> 04:31:08,819
OVER THE FINISH LINE. 

7743
04:31:08,819 --> 04:31:10,287
>> YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 

7744
04:31:10,287 --> 04:31:11,955
AND THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION WE 

7745
04:31:11,955 --> 04:31:12,956
WERE TALKING FOR THE LAST 

7746
04:31:12,956 --> 04:31:14,624
SEVERAL HOURS NOW SINCE THIS 

7747
04:31:14,624 --> 04:31:16,326
DOCUMENT WAS SIGNED AND WE 

7748
04:31:16,326 --> 04:31:18,028
STARTED LEARNING WHAT WAS IN 

7749
04:31:18,028 --> 04:31:18,462
IT. 

7750
04:31:18,462 --> 04:31:20,430
REALLY, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE ALL 

7751
04:31:20,430 --> 04:31:21,698
THESE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS 

7752
04:31:21,698 --> 04:31:23,600
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS AGREED 

7753
04:31:23,600 --> 04:31:25,302
TO, WHAT WILL HE ACTUALLY 

7754
04:31:25,302 --> 04:31:26,903
IMPLEMENT, YOU KNOW, THIS VERY 

7755
04:31:26,903 --> 04:31:28,705
LIMITED BROAD AGREEMENT, AND 

7756
04:31:28,705 --> 04:31:31,341
THAT WILL BE UP TO, AS THE 

7757
04:31:31,341 --> 04:31:32,342
PRESIDENT SAID, MIKE POMPEO AND 

7758
04:31:32,342 --> 04:31:33,143
OTHER NEGOTIATORS WILL BEGIN 

7759
04:31:33,143 --> 04:31:35,545
MEETING NEXT WEEK, WHAT WILL 

7760
04:31:35,545 --> 04:31:36,346
THAT PROCESS LOOK LIKE. 

7761
04:31:36,346 --> 04:31:37,247
AND THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 

7762
04:31:37,247 --> 04:31:38,915
HINTED THAT HE WAS LOOKING TO 

7763
04:31:38,915 --> 04:31:42,753
SEE CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA JOIN 

7764
04:31:42,753 --> 04:31:45,054
THESE TALKS IN SOME FORM OR 

7765
04:31:45,054 --> 04:31:46,256
FASHION. 

7766
04:31:46,256 --> 04:31:46,823
WILL OTHERS BE BROUGHT IN? 

7767
04:31:46,823 --> 04:31:50,227
WHAT WILL THE NATURE -- HOW 

7768
04:31:50,227 --> 04:31:51,728
OFTEN WILL THEY MEET? 

7769
04:31:51,728 --> 04:31:53,897
WILL THERE BE CERTAIN 

7770
04:31:53,897 --> 04:31:54,898
TIMETABLES FOR THESE 

7771
04:31:54,898 --> 04:31:55,498
DELIVERABLES TO BE MET? 

7772
04:31:55,498 --> 04:31:57,300
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW ANY OF 

7773
04:31:57,300 --> 04:31:57,901
THAT RIGHT NOW. 

7774
04:31:57,901 --> 04:31:58,501
IF ANYTHING, THAT'S WHAT WE 

7775
04:31:58,501 --> 04:32:00,804
WERE LOOKING TO HEAR OUT OF THE 

7776
04:32:00,804 --> 04:32:02,471
SUMMIT, IT WAS A TIMETABLE 

7777
04:32:02,471 --> 04:32:03,206
STRUCTURE FOR SOME OF THOSE 

7778
04:32:03,206 --> 04:32:04,941
TALKS AND THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE 

7779
04:32:04,941 --> 04:32:06,376
OF THOSE THINGS WE HAVEN'T 

7780
04:32:06,376 --> 04:32:06,943
QUITE LEARNED YET. 

7781
04:32:06,943 --> 04:32:08,245
MAYBE WE WILL LEARN THAT WHILE 

7782
04:32:08,245 --> 04:32:10,547
THE PRESIDENT IS FLYING BACK TO 

7783
04:32:10,547 --> 04:32:12,382
THE UNITED STATES. 

7784
04:32:12,382 --> 04:32:13,750
AND THEN ALSO WILL THERE BE 

7785
04:32:13,750 --> 04:32:15,552
CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME OF THESE 

7786
04:32:15,552 --> 04:32:17,154
-- WE TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT 

7787
04:32:17,154 --> 04:32:18,755
CALLING THE QUESTION OF THE 

7788
04:32:18,755 --> 04:32:20,524
NATURE OF THESE ALLIANCES WHEN 

7789
04:32:20,524 --> 04:32:23,627
IT COMES TO THE WAR GAMES, HIS 

7790
04:32:23,627 --> 04:32:24,795
PRESIDENT WITH PRESIDENT -- HIS 

7791
04:32:24,795 --> 04:32:25,929
CONVERSATION COMING UP WITH 

7792
04:32:25,929 --> 04:32:26,997
PRESIDENT MOON JUST A BIT. 

7793
04:32:26,997 --> 04:32:28,131
WILL THERE BE ALLIANCE FROM THE 

7794
04:32:28,131 --> 04:32:29,532
REGION AND AROUND THE WORLD IN 

7795
04:32:29,532 --> 04:32:32,202
THE WAY THE PRESIDENT HAS 

7796
04:32:32,202 --> 04:32:32,935
CONDUCTED THESE NEGOTIATIONS, 

7797
04:32:32,935 --> 04:32:33,603
THT'S SOMETHING WE'LL BE 

7798
04:32:33,603 --> 04:32:35,005
WATCHING OBVIOUSLY VERY CLOSELY 

7799
04:32:35,005 --> 04:32:37,273
AT OVER THE HOURS AND WEEKS. 

7800
04:32:37,273 --> 04:32:38,842
>> ZEKE, I HOPE YOU CAN STAND 

7801
04:32:38,842 --> 04:32:39,009
BY. 

7802
04:32:39,009 --> 04:32:40,644
ED IS STILL WITH US AS WELL 

7803
04:32:40,644 --> 04:32:41,445
FROM OUR WASHINGTON BUREAU AND 

7804
04:32:41,445 --> 04:32:43,947
ISAAC IS HERE ON THE SET WITH 

7805
04:32:43,947 --> 04:32:44,113
ME. 

7806
04:32:44,113 --> 04:32:45,449
ED, TO YOU FIRST, AND, ISAAC, 

7807
04:32:45,449 --> 04:32:46,750
I'LL ASK YOU THE SAME THING. 

7808
04:32:46,750 --> 04:32:47,951
THERE WAS ONE MOMENT WHEN THE 

7809
04:32:47,951 --> 04:32:48,752
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

7810
04:32:48,752 --> 04:32:49,820
WAS ASKED BY I THINK A MEMBER 

7811
04:32:49,820 --> 04:32:50,954
OF THE FOREIGN PRESS, I DON'T 

7812
04:32:50,954 --> 04:32:52,555
THINK IT WAS AN AMERICAN 

7813
04:32:52,555 --> 04:32:53,990
REPORTER WHO VERY POINTEDLY 

7814
04:32:53,990 --> 04:32:55,826
ASKED PRESIDENT TRUMP THE 

7815
04:32:55,826 --> 04:32:57,427
QUESTION THAT HAD BEEN ASKED BY 

7816
04:32:57,427 --> 04:32:58,861
ANALYSTS AND PUNDITS LEADING UP 

7817
04:32:58,861 --> 04:33:00,764
TO THIS HISTORIC MEETING WHICH 

7818
04:33:00,764 --> 04:33:04,434
IS BY MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN 

7819
04:33:04,434 --> 04:33:05,802
ARE YOU PROVIDING LEGITIMACY TO 

7820
04:33:05,802 --> 04:33:06,101
HIS REGIME? 

7821
04:33:06,101 --> 04:33:07,103
AND THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 

7822
04:33:07,103 --> 04:33:07,804
REFUSING TO ANSWER THAT 

7823
04:33:07,804 --> 04:33:08,904
QUESTION, MAYBE BECAUSE HE FELT 

7824
04:33:08,904 --> 04:33:10,807
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BECAUSE IT 

7825
04:33:10,807 --> 04:33:11,942
WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE U.S. 

7826
04:33:11,942 --> 04:33:12,942
PRESS, BUT THAT IS SOMETHING 

7827
04:33:12,942 --> 04:33:16,446
THAT IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSED 

7828
04:33:16,446 --> 04:33:17,546
IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD AS 

7829
04:33:17,546 --> 04:33:20,750
WE LOOK AT THE AGREEMENT THAT 

7830
04:33:20,750 --> 04:33:22,953
WAS SIGNED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP 

7831
04:33:22,953 --> 04:33:23,453
AND CHAIRMAN KIM. 

7832
04:33:23,453 --> 04:33:26,856
THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT, 

7833
04:33:26,856 --> 04:33:27,957
FOR EXAMPLE, AT ONE POINT 

7834
04:33:27,957 --> 04:33:29,559
SAYING TO A QUESTION FROM 

7835
04:33:29,559 --> 04:33:30,560
ANOTHER REPORTER SAYING THAT 

7836
04:33:30,560 --> 04:33:31,561
ONE OF THE GREAT WINNERS FROM 

7837
04:33:31,561 --> 04:33:32,996
THIS MEETING ARE THE GROUP OF 

7838
04:33:32,996 --> 04:33:35,831
NORTH KOREANS WHO ARE FORCED TO 

7839
04:33:35,831 --> 04:33:36,466
LABOR IN GULAGS, THE PRESIDENT 

7840
04:33:36,466 --> 04:33:37,833
SAYING THEY ARE ONE OF THE 

7841
04:33:37,833 --> 04:33:38,701
GREAT WINNERS AS A GROUP. 

7842
04:33:38,701 --> 04:33:39,803
I THINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE 

7843
04:33:39,803 --> 04:33:41,104
-- I KNOW THAT WE'RE STILL JUST 

7844
04:33:41,104 --> 04:33:42,539
A COUPLE OF MINUTES OUT OF THIS 

7845
04:33:42,539 --> 04:33:43,706
PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT THERE'S 

7846
04:33:43,706 --> 04:33:45,241
GOING TO BE A PARSING OF HIS 

7847
04:33:45,241 --> 04:33:46,543
WORDS, AND WORDS DO MATTER 

7848
04:33:46,543 --> 04:33:49,511
BECAUSE HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF 

7849
04:33:49,511 --> 04:33:51,615
THE UNITED STATES. 

7850
04:33:51,615 --> 04:33:51,881
>> YEAH. 

7851
04:33:51,881 --> 04:33:53,750
AND I THINK PREVIOUS 

7852
04:33:53,750 --> 04:33:55,252
ADMINISTRATIONS MIGHT HAVE PUT 

7853
04:33:55,252 --> 04:33:57,053
MORE EMPHASIS ON THAT QUESTION 

7854
04:33:57,053 --> 04:33:59,055
AND VERIFYING THAT THINGS ARE 

7855
04:33:59,055 --> 04:34:03,159
IMPROVING WHEN IT COMES TO 

7856
04:34:03,159 --> 04:34:03,992
HUMAN RIGHTS ALONGSIDE 

7857
04:34:03,992 --> 04:34:04,394
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

7858
04:34:04,394 --> 04:34:05,362
YOU KNOW, HE ALSO SUGGESTED AT 

7859
04:34:05,362 --> 04:34:07,697
ONE POINT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS DID 

7860
04:34:07,697 --> 04:34:08,164
COME UP. 

7861
04:34:08,164 --> 04:34:09,398
REMEMBER GOING INTO THIS 

7862
04:34:09,398 --> 04:34:11,434
MEETING WE WERE TOLD BY I 

7863
04:34:11,434 --> 04:34:13,402
BELIEVE SECRETARY POMPEO AND 

7864
04:34:13,402 --> 04:34:14,471
OTHER SENIOR ADMINISTRATION 

7865
04:34:14,471 --> 04:34:15,605
OFFICIALS THAT HUMAN RIGHTS 

7866
04:34:15,605 --> 04:34:16,938
WOULD NOT BE ON THE AGENDA. 

7867
04:34:16,938 --> 04:34:18,141
THEY MAY HAVE JUST SAID THAT 

7868
04:34:18,141 --> 04:34:19,475
PUBLICLY SO AS TO KEEP THE 

7869
04:34:19,475 --> 04:34:20,476
NORTH KOREANS FROM BACKING OUT 

7870
04:34:20,476 --> 04:34:21,777
AT THE LAST MINUTE AND MAYBE IT 

7871
04:34:21,777 --> 04:34:22,846
CAME UP IN THE MEETING, MAYBE 

7872
04:34:22,846 --> 04:34:24,648
IT DIDN'T COME UP IN THE 

7873
04:34:24,648 --> 04:34:24,915
MEETING. 

7874
04:34:24,915 --> 04:34:26,650
AND UNTIL WE GET SOME KIND OF 

7875
04:34:26,650 --> 04:34:28,151
VERIFICATION OF THAT, I THINK 

7876
04:34:28,151 --> 04:34:32,222
IT'S PROPER TO PERHAPS BE A BIT 

7877
04:34:32,222 --> 04:34:33,655
SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S 

7878
04:34:33,655 --> 04:34:35,358
STATEMENT THERE THAT IT DID 

7879
04:34:35,358 --> 04:34:36,059
INDEED GET DISCUSSED. 

7880
04:34:36,059 --> 04:34:37,961
YEAH, IT WILL DEFINITELY BE A 

7881
04:34:37,961 --> 04:34:42,098
MAIN TOPIC OF CONCERN AMONG THE 

7882
04:34:42,098 --> 04:34:43,064
PRESIDENT'S TOP CRITICS, NOT 

7883
04:34:43,064 --> 04:34:44,133
ONLY IN SORT OF FOREIGN POLICY 

7884
04:34:44,133 --> 04:34:47,103
OF THE WORLD, BUT I WOULD THINK 

7885
04:34:47,103 --> 04:34:48,104
ON CAPITOL HILL LATER TODAY 

7886
04:34:48,104 --> 04:34:49,905
THERE WILL START TO BE SOME 

7887
04:34:49,905 --> 04:34:50,873
CONCERN THAT, HEY, MAYBE WE'RE 

7888
04:34:50,873 --> 04:34:52,275
GOING DOWN THE PATH TOO QUICKLY 

7889
04:34:52,275 --> 04:34:54,544
WITH THEM ON THIS AND NOT ALSO 

7890
04:34:54,544 --> 04:34:56,846
DISCUSSING THE FACT THAT 

7891
04:34:56,846 --> 04:34:58,348
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NORTH 

7892
04:34:58,348 --> 04:34:59,649
KOREANS ARE IN FORCED LABOR 

7893
04:34:59,649 --> 04:35:02,351
CAMPS, THAT OTHERS HAVE BEEN 

7894
04:35:02,351 --> 04:35:03,185
KILLED WITH NO APPARENT REASON 

7895
04:35:03,185 --> 04:35:04,554
AND QUITE GRUESOMELY, AND THAT, 

7896
04:35:04,554 --> 04:35:06,655
YOU KNOW, THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO 

7897
04:35:06,655 --> 04:35:08,424
CLEARLY HAS A TOTAL GRIP ON HIS 

7898
04:35:08,424 --> 04:35:09,659
COUNTRY AND NO SENSE OF 

7899
04:35:09,659 --> 04:35:09,958
DEMOCRACY. 

7900
04:35:09,958 --> 04:35:10,660
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS ALSO 

7901
04:35:10,660 --> 04:35:13,430
ASKED AT ONE POINT DO YOU HAVE 

7902
04:35:13,430 --> 04:35:15,932
A MODEL FOR WHAT A FUTURE NORTH 

7903
04:35:15,932 --> 04:35:17,033
KOREA MIGHT LOOK LIKE, AND HE 

7904
04:35:17,033 --> 04:35:19,502
SAID, WELL, THAT'LL BE UP TO 

7905
04:35:19,502 --> 04:35:22,038
THE NORTH KOREANS TO DECIDE 

7906
04:35:22,038 --> 04:35:24,040
WHICH IS A DEFT DIPLOMATIC 

7907
04:35:24,040 --> 04:35:24,841
STATEMENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T 

7908
04:35:24,841 --> 04:35:26,508
WANT TO BE DICTATE WHAG ANOTHER 

7909
04:35:26,508 --> 04:35:27,376
COUNTRY DOES NECESSARILY. 

7910
04:35:27,376 --> 04:35:28,845
BUT, AGAIN, I THINK SOME OF HIS 

7911
04:35:28,845 --> 04:35:30,045
PREDECESSORS MIGHT HAVE SAID 

7912
04:35:30,045 --> 04:35:31,648
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF, 

7913
04:35:31,648 --> 04:35:34,951
BUT WE WOULD HOPE THAT THEY'LL 

7914
04:35:34,951 --> 04:35:36,353
ADOPT SOME SENSE OR SOME 

7915
04:35:36,353 --> 04:35:39,255
DEMOCRATIC NORMS AND BECOME A 

7916
04:35:39,255 --> 04:35:40,022
FREER SOCIETY. 

7917
04:35:40,022 --> 04:35:41,157
SO PERHAPS AN OPPORTUNITY 

7918
04:35:41,157 --> 04:35:41,557
MISSED THERE. 

7919
04:35:41,557 --> 04:35:43,460
BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS 

7920
04:35:43,460 --> 04:35:44,861
BEEN PRETTY LASER FOCUSED ON 

7921
04:35:44,861 --> 04:35:46,729
THE IDEA OF DENUCLEARIZATION 

7922
04:35:46,729 --> 04:35:47,830
FIRST AND EVERYTHING ELSE 

7923
04:35:47,830 --> 04:35:48,530
LATER. 

7924
04:35:48,530 --> 04:35:51,967
>> ED, STAND BY. 

7925
04:35:51,967 --> 04:35:54,804
I WANT TO BRING IN DUYNG KIM, 

7926
04:35:54,804 --> 04:35:56,639
SHE'S AT THE PENINSULA FUTURE 

7927
04:35:56,639 --> 04:35:58,241
FORUM, SHE IS IN SINGAPORE. 

7928
04:35:58,241 --> 04:35:59,742
YOU WATCHED THESE EVENTS UNFOLD 

7929
04:35:59,742 --> 04:36:01,243
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS 

7930
04:36:01,243 --> 04:36:01,878
HOURS CULMINATING IN THAT PRESS 

7931
04:36:01,878 --> 04:36:02,511
CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT 

7932
04:36:02,511 --> 04:36:03,179
OF THE UNITED STATES. 

7933
04:36:03,179 --> 04:36:05,749
I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THE 

7934
04:36:05,749 --> 04:36:08,151
HISTORIC MEETING AND THEN SOME 

7935
04:36:08,151 --> 04:36:09,753
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT PRESIDENT 

7936
04:36:09,753 --> 04:36:11,254
TRUMP ANSWERED, WHAT YOU 

7937
04:36:11,254 --> 04:36:17,961
THOUGHT OF HIS RESPONSES TO 

7938
04:36:17,961 --> 04:36:18,461
REPORTERS' QUESTIONS. 

7939
04:36:18,461 --> 04:36:18,862
>>REPORTER: 

7940
04:36:18,862 --> 04:36:19,462
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, VLAD. 

7941
04:36:19,462 --> 04:36:21,931
WELL, ON THE SUMMIT ITSELF, THE 

7942
04:36:21,931 --> 04:36:22,797
MEETING ITSELF, THE THEATRICS 

7943
04:36:22,797 --> 04:36:24,234
WERE THERE, THE ATMOSPHERE WAS 

7944
04:36:24,234 --> 04:36:25,735
THERE, AT LEAST THE PUBLIC 

7945
04:36:25,735 --> 04:36:27,337
VIDEO CLIPS THAT WE'VE SEEN OF 

7946
04:36:27,337 --> 04:36:28,637
THEM, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 

7947
04:36:28,637 --> 04:36:31,940
DISCUSSION WAS LIKE IN PRIVATE, 

7948
04:36:31,940 --> 04:36:34,978
BUT ON THE SUBSTANTIVE LEVEL, 

7949
04:36:34,978 --> 04:36:36,146
THE JOINT STATEMENT AND THE 

7950
04:36:36,146 --> 04:36:37,580
ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS DURING 

7951
04:36:37,580 --> 04:36:38,848
THE PRESS CONFERENCE, THEY 

7952
04:36:38,848 --> 04:36:42,252
LEAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS THAN 

7953
04:36:42,252 --> 04:36:42,651
ANSWERS. 

7954
04:36:42,651 --> 04:36:44,554
DID THEY AGREE ON WHAT 

7955
04:36:44,554 --> 04:36:45,588
DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS? 

7956
04:36:45,588 --> 04:36:47,357
DID THEY AGREE ON A TIMETABLE? 

7957
04:36:47,357 --> 04:36:48,591
IT SOUNDS LIKE BASED ON THE 

7958
04:36:48,591 --> 04:36:49,958
JOINT STATEMENT THEY DID NOT, 

7959
04:36:49,958 --> 04:36:51,161
AND PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT 

7960
04:36:51,161 --> 04:36:53,028
SECRETARY POMPEO IS GOING TO 

7961
04:36:53,028 --> 04:36:54,631
HAVE TO NEGOTIATE GOING 

7962
04:36:54,631 --> 04:36:54,898
FORWARD. 

7963
04:36:54,898 --> 04:36:56,433
ONE KEY ISSUE THAT STOOD OUT 

7964
04:36:56,433 --> 04:36:57,833
FOR ME DURING THE PRESS 

7965
04:36:57,833 --> 04:36:59,302
CONFERENCE WAS THE MENTIONING 

7966
04:36:59,302 --> 04:37:03,306
OF U.S. TROOPS ON THE KOREAN 

7967
04:37:03,306 --> 04:37:04,307
PENINSULA AND THE JOINT 

7968
04:37:04,307 --> 04:37:05,442
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH 

7969
04:37:05,442 --> 04:37:06,208
AMERICAN ALLIES, SOUTH KOREA. 

7970
04:37:06,208 --> 04:37:07,877
NOW, HE FIRST ANSWERED THE 

7971
04:37:07,877 --> 04:37:08,945
QUESTION AS SAYING, NO, WE'RE 

7972
04:37:08,945 --> 04:37:10,913
NOT REDUCING TROOPS ON THE 

7973
04:37:10,913 --> 04:37:12,115
KOREAN PENINSULA WHICH IS 

7974
04:37:12,115 --> 04:37:14,250
REASSURING TO BOTH SOUTH KOREA 

7975
04:37:14,250 --> 04:37:15,952
AND JAPANESE ALLIES, BUT THEN 

7976
04:37:15,952 --> 04:37:19,489
HE SAID HE WANTS TO WITHDRAW 

7977
04:37:19,489 --> 04:37:21,758
ALL HIS TROOPS AT SOME POINT, 

7978
04:37:21,758 --> 04:37:24,326
AND THAT IS A BIG MISTAKE. 

7979
04:37:24,326 --> 04:37:25,361
THE TROOPS ARE THERE TO 

7980
04:37:25,361 --> 04:37:26,794
MAINTAIN STABILITY AND SECURITY 

7981
04:37:26,794 --> 04:37:27,363
IN THE REGION. 

7982
04:37:27,363 --> 04:37:29,733
IT'S NOT JUST IN SOUTH KOREA, 

7983
04:37:29,733 --> 04:37:30,832
IT'S THE REGION AS A WHOLE. 

7984
04:37:30,832 --> 04:37:32,535
HE IS WRONG WHEN HE SAYS THAT 

7985
04:37:32,535 --> 04:37:34,237
IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO KEEP 

7986
04:37:34,237 --> 04:37:34,604
TROOPS THERE. 

7987
04:37:34,604 --> 04:37:35,938
IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO 

7988
04:37:35,938 --> 04:37:36,506
BRING THEM HOME. 

7989
04:37:36,506 --> 04:37:39,475
THE OTHER ISSUE IS I HAD WAS HE 

7990
04:37:39,475 --> 04:37:40,976
ANSWERED A QUESTION SAYING THAT 

7991
04:37:40,976 --> 04:37:44,447
THE WAR GAMES -- HE CALLS THEM 

7992
04:37:44,447 --> 04:37:45,648
WAR GAMES WILL BE DISCONTINUED, 

7993
04:37:45,648 --> 04:37:47,883
WILL BE CANCELED, AND THAT 

7994
04:37:47,883 --> 04:37:49,117
CONCERNS ME. 

7995
04:37:49,117 --> 04:37:50,753
DID HE MEAN THE JOINT MILITARY 

7996
04:37:50,753 --> 04:37:51,554
EXERCISES, THE DEFENSIVE 

7997
04:37:51,554 --> 04:37:54,357
DRILLS, OR DID HE MEAN THE 

7998
04:37:54,357 --> 04:37:55,723
BOMBERS AND THE STRATEGIC 

7999
04:37:55,723 --> 04:37:57,660
ASSETS THAT ARE MORE 

8000
04:37:57,660 --> 04:37:58,594
PROVOCATIVE IN THE DRILLS? 

8001
04:37:58,594 --> 04:38:00,129
IF IT'S THE FORMER, IF IT'S THE 

8002
04:38:00,129 --> 04:38:01,731
ENTIRE EXERCISES, THIS IS ALSO 

8003
04:38:01,731 --> 04:38:02,264
A BIG MISTAKE. 

8004
04:38:02,264 --> 04:38:03,433
THESE ARE DEFENSIVE IN NATURE, 

8005
04:38:03,433 --> 04:38:04,833
THE NORTH KOREANS KNOW THEY 

8006
04:38:04,833 --> 04:38:06,503
ARE, THEY KNOW WHEN THEY 

8007
04:38:06,503 --> 04:38:08,271
HAPPEN, AND IT REALLY IS -- 

8008
04:38:08,271 --> 04:38:09,339
IT'S JUST LIKE DROPPING YOUR 

8009
04:38:09,339 --> 04:38:11,274
SHIELD, YOUR DEFENSIVE SHIELD 

8010
04:38:11,274 --> 04:38:13,343
IN FRONT OF A DRAWN SWORD AND 

8011
04:38:13,343 --> 04:38:14,844
THAT DRAWN SWORD IS NORTH 

8012
04:38:14,844 --> 04:38:15,377
KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

8013
04:38:15,377 --> 04:38:17,981
UNTIL NORTH KOREA GETS RID OF 

8014
04:38:17,981 --> 04:38:22,151
THE NUKE WEAPONS, THESE 

8015
04:38:22,151 --> 04:38:23,652
MILITARY EXERCISES SHOULD NOT 

8016
04:38:23,652 --> 04:38:24,619
BE STOPPED. 

8017

04:38:59,621 --> 04:39:00,857
>> WELL, IT WILL BE INTERESTING 

8046
04:39:00,857 --> 04:39:01,858
TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY 

8047
04:39:01,858 --> 04:39:03,458
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE 

8048
04:39:03,458 --> 04:39:04,259
AGREEMENT THAT WAS SIGNED THAT 

8049
04:39:04,259 --> 04:39:05,395
IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STATEMENT 

8050
04:39:05,395 --> 04:39:06,729
THAT WAS RELEASED BECAUSE THE 

8051
04:39:06,729 --> 04:39:07,931
STATEMENT THAT WE'VE GOTTEN 

8052
04:39:07,931 --> 04:39:09,732
THAT THE PRESS SECRETARY HANDED 

8053
04:39:09,732 --> 04:39:10,966
TO US WAS ALL VERY GENERAL. 

8054
04:39:10,966 --> 04:39:11,835
IT WAS PLEDGE OF FUTURE ACTION, 

8055
04:39:11,835 --> 04:39:13,536
IT WAS A DESCRIPTION OF WHERE 

8056
04:39:13,536 --> 04:39:16,039
THEY WANT TO GO, A ROAD MAP, A 

8057
04:39:16,039 --> 04:39:17,407
FRAMEWORK, ALL OF THAT CAN BE 

8058
04:39:17,407 --> 04:39:19,707
PULLED BACK VERY QUICKLY. 

8059
04:39:19,707 --> 04:39:22,544
BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS, LOOK, 

8060
04:39:22,544 --> 04:39:23,880
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNITY 

8061
04:39:23,880 --> 04:39:25,148
BELIEVES REGARDLESS OF POLITICS 

8062
04:39:25,148 --> 04:39:26,749
THIS IS THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE 

8063
04:39:26,749 --> 04:39:30,854
IN TERMS OF THE THREAT TO U.S. 

8064
04:39:30,854 --> 04:39:31,153
TERRITORY. 

8065
04:39:31,153 --> 04:39:31,755
PRESIDENT OBAMA BEFORE THE 

8066
04:39:31,755 --> 04:39:33,356
PRESIDENT WAS INAUGURATED SAID 

8067
04:39:33,356 --> 04:39:35,658
THIS WILL BE YOUR NUMBER ONE 

8068
04:39:35,658 --> 04:39:35,957
CHALLENGE. 

8069
04:39:35,957 --> 04:39:36,960
SO GIVING THE PRESIDENT HIS DUE 

8070
04:39:36,960 --> 04:39:39,862
THAT HE GOT TO THIS POINT TO 

8071
04:39:39,862 --> 04:39:41,831
EVEN BEGIN TO ENGAGE 

8072
04:39:41,831 --> 04:39:42,698
DIPLOMATICALLY WHEN HIS 

8073
04:39:42,698 --> 04:39:44,133
PREFERRED OPTION AT FIRST 

8074
04:39:44,133 --> 04:39:45,034
GLANCE HAD BEEN MILITARILY IS 

8075
04:39:45,034 --> 04:39:46,569
SOMETHING, BUT IT IS REALLY 

8076
04:39:46,569 --> 04:39:49,738
GOING TO BE IN THE DETAILS IN 

8077
04:39:49,738 --> 04:39:51,073
TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY 

8078
04:39:51,073 --> 04:39:53,076
NEGOTIATE AT THAT MEETING NEXT 

8079
04:39:53,076 --> 04:39:53,643
WEEK, THAT JOHN BOLTON, THE 

8080
04:39:53,643 --> 04:39:54,277
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, THE 

8081
04:39:54,277 --> 04:39:55,878
SECRETARY OF STATE WILL HAVE 

8082
04:39:55,878 --> 04:39:57,380
WITH THE NORTH KOREANS AND IN 

8083
04:39:57,380 --> 04:39:58,514
THE FUTURE. 

8084
04:39:58,514 --> 04:40:00,750
I MEAN, THIS IS THE BEGINNING 

8085
04:40:00,750 --> 04:40:01,617
OF A PROCESS. 

8086
04:40:01,617 --> 04:40:02,752
IT TOOK ABOUT TWO YEARS OF 

8087
04:40:02,752 --> 04:40:04,053
NEGOTIATING WITH IRAN TO GET 

8088
04:40:04,053 --> 04:40:06,256
THE AGREEMENT THAT THE 

8089
04:40:06,256 --> 04:40:08,123
PRESIDENT HAS DESCRIBED AS 

8090
04:40:08,123 --> 04:40:08,757
IMPERFECT AND TORE UP. 

8091
04:40:08,757 --> 04:40:10,026
THAT WAS TWO YEARS WITH A 

8092
04:40:10,026 --> 04:40:11,727
COUNTRY THAT DID NOT HAVE THE 

8093
04:40:11,727 --> 04:40:12,962
TYPE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM 

8094
04:40:12,962 --> 04:40:13,730
THAT NORTH KOREA HAS. 

8095
04:40:13,730 --> 04:40:15,765
SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 

8096
04:40:15,765 --> 04:40:18,935
SOMETHING THAT POTENTIALLY GOES 

8097
04:40:18,935 --> 04:40:20,336
BEYOND THE, YOU KNOW, FIRST 

8098
04:40:20,336 --> 04:40:22,438
TERM OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, IF IT 

8099
04:40:22,438 --> 04:40:23,806
WORKS MAY NOT SEE FULL 

8100
04:40:23,806 --> 04:40:24,573
DISMANTLEMENT INTO THE SECOND 

8101
04:40:24,573 --> 04:40:26,342
TERM, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT 

8102
04:40:26,342 --> 04:40:27,109
BEHIND THE SCENES THEY'VE BEEN 

8103
04:40:27,109 --> 04:40:29,679
WORKING VERY QUICKLY TO TRY TO 

8104
04:40:29,679 --> 04:40:31,180
GET OUR PARTNERS, OTHER NUCLEAR 

8105
04:40:31,180 --> 04:40:34,316
POWERS TO CHIP IN, TO FIGURE 

8106
04:40:34,316 --> 04:40:35,751
OUT HOW THEY CAN POOL RESOURCES 

8107
04:40:35,751 --> 04:40:37,186
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN MORE 

8108
04:40:37,186 --> 04:40:37,954
QUICKLY THAN ESTIMATES. 

8109
04:40:37,954 --> 04:40:39,522
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY IT 

8110
04:40:39,522 --> 04:40:40,189
WON'T TAKE 15 YEARS. 

8111
04:40:40,189 --> 04:40:42,258
THEY WANT IT TO HAPPEN IN A 

8112
04:40:42,258 --> 04:40:44,060
SHORTER DURATION OF TIME, BUT 

8113
04:40:44,060 --> 04:40:45,961
TO ACTUALLY DISMANTLE NUKES, 

8114
04:40:45,961 --> 04:40:47,163
NONE OF THAT WAS PROMISED 

8115
04:40:47,163 --> 04:40:47,397
TODAY. 

8116
04:40:47,397 --> 04:40:48,431
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

8117
04:40:48,431 --> 04:40:49,632
CRITICAL, AS YOU KNOW, OF THE 

8118
04:40:49,632 --> 04:40:51,234
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND THERE WAS 

8119
04:40:51,234 --> 04:40:52,335
A QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED OF 

8120
04:40:52,335 --> 04:40:54,237
THE PRESIDENT, LOOK, IF YOU 

8121
04:40:54,237 --> 04:40:55,471
DON'T GET AT LEAST WHAT 

8122
04:40:55,471 --> 04:40:56,739
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS AIBLG TO 

8123
04:40:56,739 --> 04:40:58,274
GET WITH IRAN -- WAS ABLE TO 

8124
04:40:58,274 --> 04:40:59,442
GET WITH IRAN, THAT WAS DAVID 

8125
04:40:59,442 --> 04:41:01,377
SANGER, I BELIEVE, OF THE "NEW 

8126
04:41:01,377 --> 04:41:02,845
YORK TIMES," THAT'S A FAILURE. 

8127
04:41:02,845 --> 04:41:03,112
>> RIGHT 

8128
04:41:03,112 --> 04:41:03,513
>> DO YOU AGREE? 

8129
04:41:03,513 --> 04:41:05,782
>> WELL, DAVID AND I SPENT A 

8130
04:41:05,782 --> 04:41:07,249
LOT OF TIME IN VIENNA COVERING 

8131
04:41:07,249 --> 04:41:09,085
THESE NUCLEAR TALK WITH IRAN, 

8132
04:41:09,085 --> 04:41:10,153
YES, THAT THE BENCHMARK THE 

8133
04:41:10,153 --> 04:41:11,287
PRESIDENT HAS SET FOR HIMSELF 

8134
04:41:11,287 --> 04:41:11,954
AND HIS SECRETARY OF STATE. 

8135
04:41:11,954 --> 04:41:12,689
REMEMBER, MIKE POMPEO BEFORE HE 

8136
04:41:12,689 --> 04:41:15,191
WAS SECRETARY OF STATE WAS A 

8137
04:41:15,191 --> 04:41:16,459
CONGRESSMAN FROM KANSAS WHO 

8138
04:41:16,459 --> 04:41:19,062
RAISED HOLY HELL ABOUT THE IRAN 

8139
04:41:19,062 --> 04:41:19,662
NUCLEAR DEAL. 

8140
04:41:19,662 --> 04:41:21,397
HE TRIED TO STOP IT. 

8141
04:41:21,397 --> 04:41:22,932
AND SO HE'S GOT -- HE'S SET FOR 

8142
04:41:22,932 --> 04:41:24,834
HIMSELF A CHALLENGING SET OF 

8143
04:41:24,834 --> 04:41:25,267
CIRCUMSTANCES HERE. 

8144
04:41:25,267 --> 04:41:26,502
LOOK, THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, 

8145
04:41:26,502 --> 04:41:27,437
WHAT DID THEY GET? 

8146
04:41:27,437 --> 04:41:30,707
THEY GOT IRAN TO SHIP OUT 97% 

8147
04:41:30,707 --> 04:41:31,941
OF THEIR ENRICHED URANIUM. 

8148
04:41:31,941 --> 04:41:34,577
THEY GOT THEM TO DESTROY 

8149
04:41:34,577 --> 04:41:35,411
THOUSAND FS CENTRIFUGES. 

8150
04:41:35,411 --> 04:41:36,679
THEY GOT THEM TO FREEZE A 

8151
04:41:36,679 --> 04:41:38,581
PROGRAM NO WHERE NEAR NORTH 

8152
04:41:38,581 --> 04:41:38,881
KOREA'S IS. 

8153
04:41:38,881 --> 04:41:40,283
WHAT THEY DIDN'T GET, THEY 

8154
04:41:40,283 --> 04:41:42,351
DIDN'T GET A HALT TO BALLISTIC 

8155
04:41:42,351 --> 04:41:42,752
MISSILE TESTING. 

8156
04:41:42,752 --> 04:41:43,319
REMEMBER ONE OF PRESIDENT 

8157
04:41:43,319 --> 04:41:44,153
TRUMP'S COMPLAINTS  ABOUT THIS 

8158
04:41:44,153 --> 04:41:46,956
DEAL THAT THEY COULD STILL FIRE 

8159
04:41:46,956 --> 04:41:47,323
OFF MISSILES. 

8160
04:41:47,323 --> 04:41:47,957
THEY DIDN'T GET THAT. 

8161
04:41:47,957 --> 04:41:48,791
NOW THE PRESIDENT HAS SET 

8162
04:41:48,791 --> 04:41:51,060
MISSILES ON HIS AGENDA FOR 

8163
04:41:51,060 --> 04:41:51,393
NORTH KOREA. 

8164
04:41:51,393 --> 04:41:54,130
THEY DIDN'T GET ACCESS TO ALL 

8165
04:41:54,130 --> 04:41:54,530
MILITARY BASES. 

8166
04:41:54,530 --> 04:41:56,532
THEY DID GET SNAP INSPECTIONS 

8167
04:41:56,532 --> 04:41:56,799
IN IRAN. 

8168
04:41:56,799 --> 04:41:57,633
THAT WAS ANOTHER COMPLAINT 

8169
04:41:57,633 --> 04:41:58,134
PRESIDENT TRUMP SENT. 

8170
04:41:58,134 --> 04:42:00,136
THAT MEANS IN NORTH KOREA HE'S 

8171
04:42:00,136 --> 04:42:01,938
GOT TO BE TIEBL GET KIM JONG-UN 

8172
04:42:01,938 --> 04:42:04,607
TO SAY HAVE AT IT, LET YOUR 

8173
04:42:04,607 --> 04:42:06,275
INSPECTORS WANDER AROUND MY 

8174
04:42:06,275 --> 04:42:07,677
COUNTRY, INCLUDING INTO SOME OF 

8175
04:42:07,677 --> 04:42:08,911
THE MOST SECRET MILITARY BASES 

8176
04:42:08,911 --> 04:42:11,413
TO SEE IF I HAVE A NUCLEAR 

8177
04:42:11,413 --> 04:42:11,680
PROGRAM. 

8178
04:42:11,680 --> 04:42:12,314
THAT WASN'T AGREED TO TODAY. 

8179
04:42:12,314 --> 04:42:13,783
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE 

8180
04:42:13,783 --> 04:42:15,585
TO COME IN THE FUTURE. 

8181
04:42:15,585 --> 04:42:15,985
THAT TAKES TIME. 

8182
04:42:15,985 --> 04:42:17,754
THAT TAKES TRUST TO BE ABLE TO 

8183
04:42:17,754 --> 04:42:17,954
GET. 

8184
04:42:17,954 --> 04:42:19,889
AND IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO 

8185
04:42:19,889 --> 04:42:20,590
GET THERE WITH IRAN. 

8186
04:42:20,590 --> 04:42:22,892
WE WILL SEE WHERE THEY GO WITH 

8187
04:42:22,892 --> 04:42:23,292
NORTH KOREA. 

8188
04:42:23,292 --> 04:42:25,995
BUT THIS IS A STARTING POINT, 

8189
04:42:25,995 --> 04:42:28,131
AND, YOU KNOW, FOR SOMETHING 

8190
04:42:28,131 --> 04:42:29,032
THAT -- EVERYTHING IS 

8191
04:42:29,032 --> 04:42:29,766
POLITICIZED THESE DAYS, IF THEY 

8192
04:42:29,766 --> 04:42:31,734
CAN MAKE THIS WORK, IT WILL BE 

8193
04:42:31,734 --> 04:42:34,137
A WIN FOR THE WORLD, AT THE 

8194
04:42:34,137 --> 04:42:34,504
PRESIDENT SAID. 

8195
04:42:34,504 --> 04:42:35,838
IT'S A WORLD PROBLEM, HE'S NOT 

8196
04:42:35,838 --> 04:42:36,572
WRONG ON THAT. 

8197
04:42:36,572 --> 04:42:38,975
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDERED HOW 

8198
04:42:38,975 --> 04:42:40,543
WE GOT TO THIS POINT, HOW WE 

8199
04:42:40,543 --> 04:42:42,211
GOT TO THE POINT WHERE A 

8200
04:42:42,211 --> 04:42:43,279
SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT WOULD 

8201
04:42:43,279 --> 04:42:44,013
MEET WITH A NORTH KOREAN 

8202
04:42:44,013 --> 04:42:44,280
DICTATOR. 

8203
04:42:44,280 --> 04:42:45,782
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF 

8204
04:42:45,782 --> 04:42:47,784
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID WHY HE 

8205
04:42:47,784 --> 04:42:52,588
CHOSE TO MAKE THIS AN 

8206
04:42:52,588 --> 04:42:52,888
IMPERATIVE. 

8207
04:42:52,888 --> 04:42:53,288
LET'S PLAY THAT. 

8208
04:42:53,288 --> 04:42:55,691
>> FOR A LONG TIME IN MY LIFE, 

8209
04:42:55,691 --> 04:42:59,262
HIS PARENTS ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF 

8210
04:42:59,262 --> 04:42:59,495
MINE. 

8211
04:42:59,495 --> 04:43:02,732
I THINK WITHOUT OTTO THIS WOULD 

8212
04:43:02,732 --> 04:43:03,699
NOT HAVE HAPPENED. 

8213
04:43:03,699 --> 04:43:04,500
SOMETHING HAPPENED FROM THAT 

8214
04:43:04,500 --> 04:43:05,535
DAY. 

8215
04:43:05,535 --> 04:43:07,136
IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING, IT WAS 

8216
04:43:07,136 --> 04:43:09,138
BRUTAL, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE 

8217
04:43:09,138 --> 04:43:14,811
STARTED TO FOCUS ON WHAT WAS 

8218
04:43:14,811 --> 04:43:15,578
GOING ON, INCLUDING NORTH 

8219
04:43:15,578 --> 04:43:16,179
KOREA. 

8220
04:43:16,179 --> 04:43:17,179
I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 

8221
04:43:17,179 --> 04:43:20,783
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN 

8222
04:43:20,783 --> 04:43:21,084
VAIN. 

8223
04:43:21,084 --> 04:43:23,286
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS, 

8224
04:43:23,286 --> 04:43:25,388
SPECIAL YOUNG MAN. 

8225
04:43:25,388 --> 04:43:27,122
AND I HAVE TO SAY SPECIAL 

8226
04:43:27,122 --> 04:43:28,123
PARENTS, SPECIAL PEOPLE. 

8227
04:43:28,123 --> 04:43:29,892
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN. 

8228
04:43:29,892 --> 04:43:30,793
>> AND THE PRESIDENT THERE, 

8229
04:43:30,793 --> 04:43:32,295
MARGARET, SAYING THAT THIS ALL 

8230
04:43:32,295 --> 04:43:34,030
SORT OF BEGAN WITH OTTO, AT 

8231
04:43:34,030 --> 04:43:36,132
LEAST AS FAR AS WHERE WE ARE 

8232
04:43:36,132 --> 04:43:37,834
TODAY, AND WE TALKED ABOUT ALL 

8233
04:43:37,834 --> 04:43:38,835
THROUGHOUT THIS COVERAGE THAT 

8234
04:43:38,835 --> 04:43:40,670
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A CHANGE 

8235
04:43:40,670 --> 04:43:41,737
AGENT, HE'S A DISRUPTER, THAT'S 

8236
04:43:41,737 --> 04:43:44,607
WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS WANT FROM 

8237
04:43:44,607 --> 04:43:46,576
HIM, THAT'S WHAT HE'S 

8238
04:43:46,576 --> 04:43:46,976
DELIVERING. 

8239
04:43:46,976 --> 04:43:47,777
AND YET THERE ARE SEEMINGLY 

8240
04:43:47,777 --> 04:43:48,978
MOMENTS DURING THIS PRESS 

8241
04:43:48,978 --> 04:43:49,712
CONFERENCE SPECIFICALLY WHERE 

8242
04:43:49,712 --> 04:43:50,847
HE SEEMED TO INDICATE, FOR 

8243
04:43:50,847 --> 04:43:51,781
EXAMPLE, WHEN THEY SAID, WELL, 

8244
04:43:51,781 --> 04:43:55,885
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO 

8245
04:43:55,885 --> 04:43:56,218
VERIFY THIS? 

8246
04:43:56,218 --> 04:43:58,087
AND IT'S BECAUSE I TRUST 

8247
04:43:58,087 --> 04:43:58,688
CHAIRMAN KIM. 

8248
04:43:58,688 --> 04:44:00,089
AT ONE POINT SAYING HOW CAN YOU 

8249
04:44:00,089 --> 04:44:00,555
ENSURE ANYTHING? 

8250
04:44:00,555 --> 04:44:02,391
I THINK AS WE GO BACK AND WE 

8251
04:44:02,391 --> 04:44:03,392
LOOK AT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, 

8252
04:44:03,392 --> 04:44:06,295
THERE IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE 

8253
04:44:06,295 --> 04:44:06,895
QUESTIONS  ABOUT HOW THIS 

8254
04:44:06,895 --> 04:44:07,496
NEGOTIATION TAKES PLACE, 

8255
04:44:07,496 --> 04:44:08,697
BECAUSE GIVEN THE PRESIDENT IS 

8256
04:44:08,697 --> 04:44:10,366
A CHANGE AGENT, THIS USUALLY 

8257
04:44:10,366 --> 04:44:11,300
HAPPENS AT THE END. 

8258
04:44:11,300 --> 04:44:11,601
>> RIGHT. 

8259
04:44:11,601 --> 04:44:12,734
>> IN OTHER WORDS, SECRETARY 

8260
04:44:12,734 --> 04:44:14,070
POMPEO AND OTHER DIPLOMAT, 

8261
04:44:14,070 --> 04:44:15,571
BOLTON AND THE OTHERS, THEY 

8262
04:44:15,571 --> 04:44:16,138
HAMMER OUT ALL THESE 

8263
04:44:16,138 --> 04:44:16,772
AGREEMENTS, THEN THE PRESIDENT 

8264
04:44:16,772 --> 04:44:18,474
MEETS WITH THE LEADER OF NORTH 

8265
04:44:18,474 --> 04:44:20,276
KOREA AND WE COME AWAY WITH AN 

8266
04:44:20,276 --> 04:44:21,377
AGREEMENT AND A FRAMEWORK IN 

8267
04:44:21,377 --> 04:44:21,878
PLACE. 

8268
04:44:21,878 --> 04:44:23,479
THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. 

8269
04:44:23,479 --> 04:44:23,912
>> RIGHT. 

8270
04:44:23,912 --> 04:44:25,982
AND TO BE FAIR, EVEN THOSE WHO 

8271
04:44:25,982 --> 04:44:28,084
WERE IN HIGH NATIONAL SECURITY 

8272
04:44:28,084 --> 04:44:29,886
POSITIONS IN THE OBAMA 

8273
04:44:29,886 --> 04:44:30,486
ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING THE 

8274
04:44:30,486 --> 04:44:31,154
FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 

8275
04:44:31,154 --> 04:44:32,688
INTELLIGENCE JIM CLAPPER WHO IS 

8276
04:44:32,688 --> 04:44:34,090
NO FAN OF THIS PRESIDENT HAS 

8277
04:44:34,090 --> 04:44:38,594
SAID I GIVE HIM CREDIT ON THIS 

8278
04:44:38,594 --> 04:44:41,063
BECAUSE HE ADVOCATED, LOOK, 

8279
04:44:41,063 --> 04:44:41,530
YOU'VE GOTTA ENGAGE. 

8280
04:44:41,530 --> 04:44:44,267
AND IN A COUNTRY IN NORTH KOREA 

8281
04:44:44,267 --> 04:44:45,100
YOU DON'T HAVE BUREAUCRACIES 

8282
04:44:45,100 --> 04:44:45,768
AND PROFESSIONAL DIPLOMATS 

8283
04:44:45,768 --> 04:44:47,036
EMPOWERED IN THE WAY YOU MIGHT 

8284
04:44:47,036 --> 04:44:48,237
HAVE IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT 

8285
04:44:48,237 --> 04:44:49,472
REALLY IN SOME WAYS THE ONLY 

8286
04:44:49,472 --> 04:44:51,106
PERSON WHO MATTERS IN TERMS OF 

8287
04:44:51,106 --> 04:44:54,410
DECISION MAKING IS THE GUY AT 

8288
04:44:54,410 --> 04:44:55,411
THE TOP, KIM JONG-UN. 

8289
04:44:55,411 --> 04:44:56,479
REMEMBER, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO, 

8290
04:44:56,479 --> 04:44:57,679
YES, IS SITTING ACROSS FROM THE 

8291
04:44:57,679 --> 04:44:59,815
MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD, 

8292
04:44:59,815 --> 04:45:00,515
THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, HE'S 

8293
04:45:00,515 --> 04:45:03,386
SOMEONE WHO'S ALSO MURDERED HIS 

8294
04:45:03,386 --> 04:45:03,786
FAMILY MEMBERS. 

8295
04:45:03,786 --> 04:45:05,788
HE IS SOMEONE WHO'S CARRIED OUT 

8296
04:45:05,788 --> 04:45:07,190
MASS SOME WOULD SAY GENOCIDE, 

8297
04:45:07,190 --> 04:45:11,494
CERTAINLY MASS KILLING OF HIS 

8298
04:45:11,494 --> 04:45:13,863
OWN PEOPLE, STARVATION, LABOR 

8299
04:45:13,863 --> 04:45:14,296
CAMPS, GULAGS. 

8300
04:45:14,296 --> 04:45:16,065
SO THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS 

8301
04:45:16,065 --> 04:45:16,598
TOTALITARIAN IN POWER. 

8302
04:45:16,598 --> 04:45:19,368
HE'S THE PERSON YOU'LL HAVE TO 

8303
04:45:19,368 --> 04:45:19,935
SIT AWAY FROM. 

8304
04:45:19,935 --> 04:45:21,070
THE U.S. HAS BROKERED DEALS 

8305
04:45:21,070 --> 04:45:22,537
WITH BRUTAL MURDERERS IN THE 

8306
04:45:22,537 --> 04:45:24,540
PAST WHEN IT HAS SERVED THE 

8307
04:45:24,540 --> 04:45:25,141
NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS, 

8308
04:45:25,141 --> 04:45:27,810
AND THAT IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

8309
04:45:27,810 --> 04:45:29,712
IS TRYING TO DO TODAY. 

8310
04:45:29,712 --> 04:45:31,013
IT IS A HUGE DIPLOMATIC GAMBLE, 

8311
04:45:31,013 --> 04:45:32,515
AND IT IS INTERESTING THAT HE'S 

8312
04:45:32,515 --> 04:45:34,684
WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK. 

8313
04:45:34,684 --> 04:45:36,485
AS YOU SAY, IF PEOPLE -- AS YOU 

8314
04:45:36,485 --> 04:45:37,820
SAY, THE PEOPLE WEREN'T WILLING 

8315
04:45:37,820 --> 04:45:38,220
TO IN THE PAST. 

8316
04:45:38,220 --> 04:45:42,992
IT'S NOW GOING TO BE ALL IN THE 

8317
04:45:42,992 --> 04:45:43,392
DETAILS. 

8318
04:45:43,392 --> 04:45:43,992
THAT'S WHY JOURNALISTS WILL 

8319
04:45:43,992 --> 04:45:44,593
CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE, 

8320
04:45:44,593 --> 04:45:47,163
ANALYSTS WILL CONTINUE TO PICK 

8321
04:45:47,163 --> 04:45:47,929
APART THESE DETAILS, NOT 

8322
04:45:47,929 --> 04:45:49,265
NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF ANY KIND 

8323
04:45:49,265 --> 04:45:50,666
OF POLITICS, BUT BECAUSE THIS 

8324
04:45:50,666 --> 04:45:53,269
HAS TO BE FLAWLESS IN EXECUTION 

8325
04:45:53,269 --> 04:45:54,170
FOR THIS GAMBLE TO PAY OFF. 

8326
04:45:54,170 --> 04:45:55,203
AND WHAT WE HAVE HEARD BEHIND 

8327
04:45:55,203 --> 04:45:56,772
THE SCENES IS THAT THE WHITE 

8328
04:45:56,772 --> 04:45:58,608
HOUSE AND OTHERS HAVE SAID, 

8329
04:45:58,608 --> 04:45:59,708
LOOK, IF WE CAN JUST GET 

8330
04:45:59,708 --> 04:46:01,010
INSPECTORS ON THE GROUND, IF WE 

8331
04:46:01,010 --> 04:46:02,812
CAN JUST GET THEM TO OPEN UP 

8332
04:46:02,812 --> 04:46:05,014
THE DOOR, LET OUR PEOPLE IN 

8333
04:46:05,014 --> 04:46:06,015
THERE, HAVE EYES ON, EARS ON, 

8334
04:46:06,015 --> 04:46:07,717
WALK AROUND SOME OF THESE SITES 

8335
04:46:07,717 --> 04:46:09,719
AND GET A GOOD SENSE OF THINGS 

8336
04:46:09,719 --> 04:46:13,189
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BLACK BOX, 

8337
04:46:13,189 --> 04:46:14,890
WE KNEW FAR MORE ABOUT IRAN AND 

8338
04:46:14,890 --> 04:46:15,725
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM THAN WE 

8339
04:46:15,725 --> 04:46:17,426
KNOW ABOUT NORTH KOREA BECAUSE 

8340
04:46:17,426 --> 04:46:20,196
OF OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION, 

8341
04:46:20,196 --> 04:46:21,364
BECAUSE OF SO MUCH OVER TIME. 

8342
04:46:21,364 --> 04:46:22,731
NORTH KOREA WE KNOW FAR LESS, 

8343
04:46:22,731 --> 04:46:24,467
AND WE'VE HEARD THAT FROM 

8344
04:46:24,467 --> 04:46:25,268
NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS 

8345
04:46:25,268 --> 04:46:26,235
FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, 

8346
04:46:26,235 --> 04:46:27,136
FROM THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 

8347
04:46:27,136 --> 04:46:29,772
SAY, LOOK, IN THE PAST WHEN WE 

8348
04:46:29,772 --> 04:46:30,673
HAVE GOTTEN INSPECTORS IN THERE 

8349
04:46:30,673 --> 04:46:32,908
-- REMEMBER, THEY DID COME IN 

8350
04:46:32,908 --> 04:46:34,009
UNDER THAT 1994 AGREEMENT? 

8351
04:46:34,009 --> 04:46:34,376
>> I REMEMBER. 

8352
04:46:34,376 --> 04:46:36,212
>> AND THEY WERE THROWN OUT IN 

8353
04:46:36,212 --> 04:46:38,447
THE BUSH ERA WHEN THEY POINTED 

8354
04:46:38,447 --> 04:46:39,881
OUT THEY WERE CHEATING, THEY 

8355
04:46:39,881 --> 04:46:41,117
úG 

8356
04:46:41,117 --> 04:46:44,220
FOUND FAR MORE THAN WE EVER 

8357
04:46:44,220 --> 04:46:44,920
THOUGHT, AND THEY WERE 

8358
04:46:44,920 --> 04:46:46,154
ENRICHING AND DOING THINGS MORE 

8359
04:46:46,154 --> 04:46:47,490
AND BEYOND WHAT THE U.S. HAD 

8360
04:46:47,490 --> 04:46:47,956
THOUGHT POSSIBLE. 

8361
04:46:47,956 --> 04:46:49,925
SO IF THEY CAN AT LEAST GET IN 

8362
04:46:49,925 --> 04:46:52,160
THERE AND VERIFY, AND IT WAS 

8363
04:46:52,160 --> 04:46:53,395
OUR MAJOR DWAIRT WHO ASKED 

8364
04:46:53,395 --> 04:46:54,263
ABOUT -- MAJOR GARRETT WHO 

8365
04:46:54,263 --> 04:46:55,464
ASKED ABOUT THAT, THE PRESIDENT 

8366
04:46:55,464 --> 04:46:56,499
WAS VAGUE, AS YOU SAY, BUT 

8367
04:46:56,499 --> 04:46:58,667
THAT'S WHEN IT'S GOING TO COME 

8368
04:46:58,667 --> 04:47:00,169
DOWN TO POMPEO AND BOLTON 

8369
04:47:00,169 --> 04:47:01,470
WORKING OUT HOW THIS WORKS AND 

8370
04:47:01,470 --> 04:47:02,872
BOLTON, SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT 

8371
04:47:02,872 --> 04:47:05,374
HIS PAST COMMENTS IN POLITICS, 

8372
04:47:05,374 --> 04:47:06,308
HE IS SOMEONE WHO'S A -- WHO 

8373
04:47:06,308 --> 04:47:08,110
HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN ARMS 

8374
04:47:08,110 --> 04:47:08,377
CONTROL. 

8375
04:47:08,377 --> 04:47:09,612
>> WE'VE GOT JUST ABOUT TWO 

8376
04:47:09,612 --> 04:47:11,113
MINUTES LEFT, MARGARET, TO TALK 

8377
04:47:11,113 --> 04:47:11,413
ABOUT THIS. 

8378
04:47:11,413 --> 04:47:14,182
YOU POINT OUT THAT MAJOR DID 

8379
04:47:14,182 --> 04:47:16,419
ASK ABOUT THE VERIFYING OF -- 

8380
04:47:16,419 --> 04:47:18,020
AND HAVING INSPECTORS AND THE 

8381
04:47:18,020 --> 04:47:18,821
PRESIDENT SAYING, YEAH, YEAH, 

8382
04:47:18,821 --> 04:47:19,755
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE, 

8383
04:47:19,755 --> 04:47:21,524
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 

8384
04:47:21,524 --> 04:47:22,325
COMBINATION EVERY AMERICANS AND 

8385
04:47:22,325 --> 04:47:23,225
PERHAPS OTHERS, WHY NOT PUT 

8386
04:47:23,225 --> 04:47:26,429
THAT IN THE AGREEMENT THAT WE 

8387
04:47:26,429 --> 04:47:26,829
HAVE TODAY? 

8388
04:47:26,829 --> 04:47:27,430
AT LEAST SOMETHING CONCRETE? 

8389
04:47:27,430 --> 04:47:28,030
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING 

8390
04:47:28,030 --> 04:47:30,266
RIGHT NOW IS A LOT OF PEOPLE 

8391
04:47:30,266 --> 04:47:32,501
SAYING THIS THING IS VAGUE AND 

8392
04:47:32,501 --> 04:47:33,769
THE NORTH KOREANS, EVERY FOUR 

8393
04:47:33,769 --> 04:47:35,004
OF THOSE BULLET POINTS HAVE 

8394
04:47:35,004 --> 04:47:36,972
BEEN PROMISED IN 1994 AND AGAIN 

8395
04:47:36,972 --> 04:47:37,239
IN 2000. 

8396
04:47:37,239 --> 04:47:38,440
>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING 

8397
04:47:38,440 --> 04:47:39,208
THEY HAVEN'T IRONED OUT. 

8398
04:47:39,208 --> 04:47:40,309
WE KNOW THE U.S. HAS PUT 

8399
04:47:40,309 --> 04:47:41,210
TOGETHER THEIR SORT OF DREAM 

8400
04:47:41,210 --> 04:47:44,113
TEAM THAT THEY WANT TO SEE WITH 

8401
04:47:44,113 --> 04:47:45,548
INSPECTORS AND PEOPLE WITH 

8402
04:47:45,548 --> 04:47:46,348
EXPERIENCE IN NUCLEAR POWER. 

8403
04:47:46,348 --> 04:47:47,216
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING JUST 

8404
04:47:47,216 --> 04:47:47,950
ANYONE CAN DO, RIGHT? 

8405
04:47:47,950 --> 04:47:49,618
YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO BUILD A 

8406
04:47:49,618 --> 04:47:51,320
NUCLEAR WEAPON, TO KNOW HOW TO 

8407
04:47:51,320 --> 04:47:52,554
TAKE IT APART. 

8408
04:47:52,554 --> 04:47:53,923
AND THERE'S A LIMITED NUMBER OF 

8409
04:47:53,923 --> 04:47:54,890
SCIENTISTS WHO CAN DO THAT. 

8410
04:47:54,890 --> 04:47:57,026
SO THE U.S. HAS BEEN PUTTING 

8411
04:47:57,026 --> 04:47:59,729
TOGETHER ALLIES, THE U.K., 

8412
04:47:59,729 --> 04:48:01,163
OTHERS HAVE OFFERED RESOURCES. 

8413
04:48:01,163 --> 04:48:01,697
SOME OF OUR ADVERSARIES, 

8414
04:48:01,697 --> 04:48:02,798
RUSSIA, CHINA, THEY'VE GOT 

8415
04:48:02,798 --> 04:48:03,766
EXPERIENCE WITH THAT. 

8416
04:48:03,766 --> 04:48:05,468
WE WANT THEM IN ON THIS. 

8417
04:48:05,468 --> 04:48:06,869
HAVING THOSE PEOPLE IN THERE IS 

8418
04:48:06,869 --> 04:48:08,070
SOMETHING THAT NORTH KOREA HAS 

8419
04:48:08,070 --> 04:48:11,306
TO AGREE TO, AND SO THEY MAY BE 

8420
04:48:11,306 --> 04:48:12,908
ABLE TO SAY, OH, YES TO THE 

8421
04:48:12,908 --> 04:48:14,142
AMERICAN, NO TO THE FRENCH. 

8422
04:48:14,142 --> 04:48:15,911
YES TO THE CHINESE, NO TO THE 

8423
04:48:15,911 --> 04:48:17,813
RUSSIANS, ALL THAT STUFF HAS TO 

8424
04:48:17,813 --> 04:48:18,213
BE NEGOTIATED. 

8425
04:48:18,213 --> 04:48:20,416
AND THAT IS WHERE IT CAN GET 

8426
04:48:20,416 --> 04:48:20,649
MESSY. 

8427
04:48:20,649 --> 04:48:22,017
KIM JONG-UN CAN DRAW THIS OUT 

8428
04:48:22,017 --> 04:48:24,253
FOR AS LONG AS HE WANTS. 

8429
04:48:24,253 --> 04:48:25,121
AND THAT IS THE RISK WITH 

8430
04:48:25,121 --> 04:48:30,025
DIPLOMACY, IT IS NOT WITHOUT A 

8431
04:48:30,025 --> 04:48:30,793
PRICE. 

8432
04:48:30,793 --> 04:48:31,093

AND A VERY SPECIAL PERSON, 

8591
04:56:17,926 --> 04:56:20,596
PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA WHO HAS 

8592
04:56:20,596 --> 04:56:22,297
REALLY CLOSED UP THAT BORDER, 

8593
04:56:22,297 --> 04:56:23,699
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LESS SO OVER 

8594
04:56:23,699 --> 04:56:25,601
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT 

8595
04:56:25,601 --> 04:56:25,934
THAT'S OKAY. 

8596
04:56:25,934 --> 04:56:27,803

EFFORTS TO HELP US GET TO THIS 

8602
04:56:39,748 --> 04:56:40,215
VERY HISTORIC DAY. 

8603
04:56:40,215 --> 04:56:43,752
MOST IMPORTANTLY I WANT TO 

8604
04:56:43,752 --> 04:56:45,353
THANK CHAIRMAN KIM FOR TAKING 

8605
04:56:45,353 --> 04:56:48,123

8606
04:56:48,123 --> 04:56:50,325
BRIGHT NEW FUTURE FOR HIS 

8607
04:56:50,325 --> 04:56:50,959
PEOPLE, OUR UNPRECEDENTED 

8608
04:56:50,959 --> 04:56:53,594
MEETING, THE FIRST BETWEEN AN 

8609
04:56:53,594 --> 04:56:57,299
AMERICAN PRESIDENT AND A LEADER 

8610
04:56:57,299 --> 04:56:59,401
OF NORTH KOREA PROVES THAT REAL 

8611
04:56:59,401 --> 04:57:01,569
CHANGE IS INDEED POSSIBLE. 

8612
04:57:01,569 --> 04:57:05,107
MY MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN KIM 

8613
04:57:05,107 --> 04:57:05,941
WAS HONEST, DIRECT AND 

8614
04:57:05,941 --> 04:57:06,241
PRODUCTIVE. 

8615
04:57:06,241 --> 04:57:09,344
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER WELL 

8616
04:57:09,344 --> 04:57:13,048
IN A VERY CONFINED PERIOD OF 

8617
04:57:13,048 --> 04:57:16,685
TIME, UNDER VERY STRONG, STRONG 

8618
04:57:16,685 --> 04:57:17,018
CIRCUMSTANCE. 

8619
04:57:17,018 --> 04:57:18,720
WE'RE PREPARED TO START A NEW 

8620
04:57:18,720 --> 04:57:20,689
HISTORY, AND WE'RE READY TO 

8621
04:57:20,689 --> 04:57:24,293
WRITE A NEW CHAPTER BETWEEN OUR 

8622
04:57:24,293 --> 04:57:24,626
NATIONS. 

8623
04:57:24,626 --> 04:57:26,128
NEARLY 70 YEARS AGO, THINK OF 

8624
04:57:26,128 --> 04:57:30,799
THAT, NEARLY 70 YEARS AGO AN 

8625
04:57:30,799 --> 04:57:31,366
EXTREMELY BLOODY CONFLICT 

8626
04:57:31,366 --> 04:57:34,302
RAVAGED THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 

8627
04:57:34,302 --> 04:57:35,904
COUNTLESS PEOPLE DIED IN THE 

8628
04:57:35,904 --> 04:57:37,639
CONFLICT, INCLUDING TENS OF 

8629
04:57:37,639 --> 04:57:39,508
THOUSANDS OF BRAVE AMERICANS, 

8630
04:57:39,508 --> 04:57:40,676
YET WHILE THE ARMISTICE WAS 

8631
04:57:40,676 --> 04:57:42,177
AGREED TO, THE WAR NEVER ENDED, 

8632
04:57:42,177 --> 04:57:43,545
TO THIS DAY NEVER ENDED, BUT 

8633
04:57:43,545 --> 04:57:46,048
NOW WE CAN ALL HAVE HOPE THAT 

8634
04:57:46,048 --> 04:57:50,752
IT WILL SOON END, AND IT WILL, 

8635
04:57:50,752 --> 04:57:51,553
IT WILL SOON END. 

8636
04:57:51,553 --> 04:57:54,222
THE PAST DOES NOT HAVE TO 

8637
04:57:54,222 --> 04:57:54,789
DEFINE THE FUTURE. 

8638
04:57:54,789 --> 04:57:57,759
YES, IT IS CONFLICT, IT DOES 

8639
04:57:57,759 --> 04:57:59,928
NOT HAVE TO BE TOMORROW'S WAR, 

8640
04:57:59,928 --> 04:58:06,368
AND AS HISTORY HAS PROVEN OVER 

8641
04:58:06,368 --> 04:58:11,740
AND OVER AGAIN, ADVERSARIES CAN 

8642
04:58:11,740 --> 04:58:12,273
INDEED BECOME FRIENDS. 

8643
04:58:12,273 --> 04:58:12,574
WE CAN HONOR THE 

8644
04:58:18,246 --> 04:58:20,349
THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT NORTH 

8645
04:58:20,349 --> 04:58:27,456
KOREA CAN ACHIEVE WHEN IT GIVES 

8646
04:58:27,456 --> 04:58:28,356
UP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND 

8647
04:58:28,356 --> 04:58:28,823
EMBRACES COMMERCE AND 

8648
04:58:28,823 --> 04:58:30,592
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE REST OF THE 

8649
04:58:30,592 --> 04:58:37,899
WORLD THAT REALLY WANTS TO 

8650
04:58:37,899 --> 04:58:38,132
ENGAGE. 

8651
04:58:38,132 --> 04:58:38,934
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS BEFORE HIM AN 

8652
04:58:38,934 --> 04:58:40,402

AND PROSPERITY FOR HIS PEOPLE. 

8656
04:58:48,977 --> 04:58:51,146
CHAIRMAN KIM AND I JUST SIGNED 

8657
04:58:51,146 --> 04:58:54,449
A JOINT STATEMENT IN WHICH HE 

8658
04:58:54,449 --> 04:58:59,221
REAFFIRMED HIS UNWAVERING 

8659
04:58:59,221 --> 04:59:00,421
COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE 

8660
04:59:00,421 --> 04:59:01,823
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 

8661
04:59:01,823 --> 04:59:02,324
PENINSULA.

WE ALSO AGREED TO VIGOROUS

AGREEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 

8665
04:59:06,494 --> 04:59:11,299
AND HE WANTS TO DO THAT. 

8666
04:59:11,299 --> 04:59:12,501
THIS ISN'T THE PAST. 

8667
04:59:12,501 --> 04:59:13,702
THIS ISN'T ANOTHER 

8668
04:59:13,702 --> 04:59:15,804
ADMINISTRATION THAT NEVER GOT 

8669
04:59:15,804 --> 04:59:18,306
IT STARTED, AND THEREFORE NEVER 

8670
04:59:18,306 --> 04:59:18,907
GOT IT DONE. 

8671
04:59:18,907 --> 04:59:24,780
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS TOLD ME THAT 

8672
04:59:24,780 --> 04:59:27,249
NORTH KOREA IS ALREADY 

8673
04:59:27,249 --> 04:59:28,850
DESTROYING A MAJOR MISSILE 

8674
04:59:28,850 --> 04:59:29,951
ENGINE TESTING SITE. 

8675
04:59:29,951 --> 04:59:31,153
THAT'S NOT IN YOUR SIGNED 

8676
04:59:31,153 --> 04:59:31,420
DOCUMENT. 

8677
04:59:31,420 --> 04:59:34,122
WE AGREED TO THAT AFTER THE 

8678
04:59:34,122 --> 04:59:34,789
AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED. 

8679
04:59:34,789 --> 04:59:37,125
THAT'S A BIG THING FOR THE 

8680
04:59:37,125 --> 04:59:38,727
MISSILES THAT THEY WERE 

8681
04:59:38,727 --> 04:59:40,662
TESTING, THE SITE IS GOING TO 

8682
04:59:40,662 --> 04:59:41,997
BE DESTROYED VERY SOON. 

8683
04:59:41,997 --> 04:59:43,498
TODAY IS THE BEGINNING OF 

8684
04:59:43,498 --> 04:59:43,931
ANARDUOUS PROCESS. 

8685
04:59:43,931 --> 04:59:46,001
OUR EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, BUT 

8686
04:59:46,001 --> 04:59:50,305
PEACE IS ALWAYS WORTH THE 

8687
04:59:50,305 --> 04:59:51,105
EFFORT, ESPECIALLY IN THIS 

8688
04:59:51,105 --> 04:59:51,305
CASE. 

8689
04:59:51,305 --> 04:59:53,141
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE 

8690
04:59:53,141 --> 04:59:53,542
YEARS AGO. 

8691
04:59:53,542 --> 04:59:58,246
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED 

8692
04:59:58,246 --> 04:59:58,947
A LONG TIME AGO. 

8693
04:59:58,947 --> 05:00:00,282
BUT WE ARE WE'RE RESOLVING IT 

8694
05:00:00,282 --> 05:00:00,482
NOW. 

8695
05:00:00,482 --> 05:00:01,850
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS THE CHANCE TO 

8696
05:00:01,850 --> 05:00:06,421
SEIZE AN INCREDIBLE FUTURE FOR 

8697
05:00:06,421 --> 05:00:06,754
HIS PEOPLE. 

8698
05:00:06,754 --> 05:00:13,728
ANYONE CAN MAKE WAR, BUT ONLY 

8699
05:00:13,728 --> 05:00:14,328
THE MOST COURAGEOUS CAN MAKE 

8700
05:00:14,328 --> 05:00:14,562
PEACE. 

8701
05:00:14,562 --> 05:00:19,000
THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS 

8702
05:00:19,000 --> 05:00:19,567
CANNOT ENDURE FOREVER, THE 

8703
05:00:19,567 --> 05:00:23,004
PEOPLE OF KOREA, NORTH AND 

8704
05:00:23,004 --> 05:00:28,243
SOUTH ARE PROFOUNDLY 

8705
05:00:28,243 --> 05:00:29,277
TALENTED, INDUSTRIOUS AND 

8706
05:00:29,277 --> 05:00:29,511
GIFTED. 

8707
05:00:29,511 --> 05:00:30,145
THESE ARE TRULY GIFTED PEOPLE. 

8708
05:00:30,145 --> 05:00:32,079
THEY SHARE THE SAME HERITAGE, 

8709
05:00:32,079 --> 05:00:32,513
LANGUAGE, CULTURE, 

8710
05:00:32,513 --> 05:00:32,980
CUSTOMS AND DESTINY. 

8711
05:00:32,980 --> 05:00:34,983
BUT TO REALIZE THEIR AMAZING 

8712
05:00:34,983 --> 05:00:35,516
DESTINY, TO REUNITE THEIR 

8713
05:00:35,516 --> 05:00:37,151
NATIONAL FAMILY, THE MENACE OF 

8714
05:00:37,151 --> 05:00:37,719
NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL NOW BE 

8715
05:00:37,719 --> 05:00:37,986
REMOVED. 

8716
05:00:37,986 --> 05:00:42,990
IN THE MEANTIME, THE SANCTIONS 

8717
05:00:42,990 --> 05:00:43,491
WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT. 

8718
05:00:43,491 --> 05:00:48,096
WE DREAM OF A FUTURE WHERE ALL 

8719
05:00:48,096 --> 05:00:52,767
KOREANS CAN LIVE TOGETHER IN 

8720
05:00:52,767 --> 05:00:55,336
HARMONEY, WHERE FAMILIES ARE 

8721
05:00:55,336 --> 05:00:55,970
REUNITED AND HOPES ARE REBORN, 

8722
05:00:55,970 --> 05:00:56,571
AND WHERE THE LIGHT OF PEACE 

8723
05:00:56,571 --> 05:00:58,940
CHASES AWAY THE DARKNESS OF 

8724
05:00:58,940 --> 05:00:59,507
WAR, THIS BRIGHT FUTURE IS 

8725
05:00:59,507 --> 05:01:00,775
WITHIN IT AND THIS IS WHAT'S 

8726
05:01:00,775 --> 05:01:01,075
HAPPENING. 

8727
05:01:01,075 --> 05:01:02,310
IT IS RIGHT THERE, IT'S WITHIN 

8728
05:01:02,310 --> 05:01:02,610
OUR REACH. 

8729
05:01:02,610 --> 05:01:06,348
IT'S GOING TO BE THERE. 

8730
05:01:06,348 --> 05:01:06,815
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. 

8731
05:01:06,815 --> 05:01:07,482
PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS COULD NEVER 

8732
05:01:07,482 --> 05:01:09,284
TAKE PLACE. 

8733
05:01:09,284 --> 05:01:11,419
IT IS NOW TAKING PLACE. 

8734
05:01:11,419 --> 05:01:14,222

UNCOMFORTABLE.

05:01:57,199 --> 05:01:57,399
SURE. 

8762
05:01:57,399 --> 05:01:57,666
GO AHEAD. 

8763
05:01:57,666 --> 05:01:59,034
NBC. 

8764
05:01:59,034 --> 05:01:59,534
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, MR.

8765
05:01:59,534 --> 05:01:59,801
PRESIDENT.

8766
05:01:59,801 --> 05:02:01,269
TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU, IF YOU 

8767
05:02:01,269 --> 05:02:01,569
DON'T MIND. 

8768
05:02:01,569 --> 05:02:05,507
FIRST, THE MAN YOU MET TODAY, 

8769
05:02:05,507 --> 05:02:06,140
KIM JONG-UN, AS YOU KNOW HAS 

8770
05:02:06,140 --> 05:02:07,042
KILLED FAMILY MEMBERS, HAS 

8771
05:02:07,042 --> 05:02:07,609
STARVED HIS OWN PEOPLE, IS 

8772
05:02:07,609 --> 05:02:09,778
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF 

8773
05:02:09,778 --> 05:02:10,145
OTTO WARMBIER. 

8774
05:02:10,145 --> 05:02:15,016
WHY ARE YOU SO COMFORTABLE 

8775
05:02:15,016 --> 05:02:18,053
CALLING HIM VERY TALENTED? 

8776
05:02:18,053 --> 05:02:18,653
>> WELL, HE IS VERY TALENTED. 

8777
05:02:18,653 --> 05:02:22,890
ANYBODY THAT TAKES OVER A 

8778
05:02:22,890 --> 05:02:23,457
SITUATION LIKE HE DID AT 26 

8779
05:02:23,457 --> 05:02:26,328
YEARS OF AGE AND IS ABLE TO RUN 

8780
05:02:26,328 --> 05:02:26,928
IT AND RUN IT TOUGH, I DON'T 

8781
05:02:26,928 --> 05:02:31,332
SAY HE WAS NICE, OR I DON'T SAY 

8782
05:02:31,332 --> 05:02:33,635
ANYTHING ABOUT IT, BUT VERY FEW 

8783
05:02:33,635 --> 05:02:34,269
PEOPLE AT THAT AGE -- YOU COULD 

8784
05:02:34,269 --> 05:02:39,040
TAKE ONE OUT OF 10,000 PROBABLY 

8785
05:02:39,040 --> 05:02:41,509
COULDN'T DO IT. 

8786
05:02:41,509 --> 05:02:43,278
OTTO WARMBIER IS A VERY SPECIAL 

8787
05:02:43,278 --> 05:02:43,712
PERSON, AND HE WILL 

8788
05:02:43,712 --> 05:02:44,478
BE FOR A LONG TIME IN MY LIFE. 

8789
05:02:44,478 --> 05:02:47,114
HIS PARENTS ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF 

8790
05:02:47,114 --> 05:02:47,315
MINE. 

8791
05:02:47,315 --> 05:02:49,417
I THINK WITHOUT OTTO THIS WOULD 

8792
05:02:49,417 --> 05:02:49,850
NOT HAVE HAPPENED. 

8793
05:02:49,850 --> 05:02:50,651
SOMETHING HAPPENED FROM THAT 

8794
05:02:50,651 --> 05:02:50,851
DAY. 

8795
05:02:50,851 --> 05:02:54,588
IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING, IT WAS 

8796
05:02:54,588 --> 05:03:03,231
BRUTAL, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE 

8797
05:03:03,231 --> 05:03:06,167
STARTED TO FOCUS ON WHAT WAS 

8798
05:03:06,167 --> 05:03:07,268
GOING ON, INCLUDING NORTH 

8799
05:03:07,268 --> 05:03:07,502
KOREA. 

8800
05:03:07,502 --> 05:03:08,069
I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 

8801
05:03:08,069 --> 05:03:09,671
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN 

8802
05:03:09,671 --> 05:03:10,772
VAIN. 

8803
05:03:10,772 --> 05:03:11,339
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS. 

8804
05:03:11,339 --> 05:03:11,806
A SPECIAL YOUNG MAN. 

8805
05:03:11,806 --> 05:03:12,574
AND I HAVE TO SAY SPECIAL 

8806
05:03:12,574 --> 05:03:17,178
PARENTS, SPECIAL PEOPLE. 

8807
05:03:17,178 --> 05:03:18,680
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN.HE HAD 

8808
05:03:18,680 --> 05:03:22,383
A LOT TO DO WITH US BEING HERE 

8809
05:03:22,383 --> 05:03:22,616
TODAY. 

8810
05:03:22,616 --> 05:03:23,050
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8811
05:03:23,050 --> 05:03:24,185
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, 

8812
05:03:24,185 --> 05:03:24,786
THAT SECOND QUESTION FOR YOU, 

8813
05:03:24,786 --> 05:03:25,553
SIR, IS ON THE SECURITY -- 

8814
05:03:25,553 --> 05:03:26,087
SECOND QUESTION IS ON THE 

8815
05:03:26,087 --> 05:03:27,489
SECURITY ASSURANCES YOU TALKED 

8816
05:03:27,489 --> 05:03:28,889
ABOUT IN YOUR STATEMENT. 

8817
05:03:28,889 --> 05:03:30,058
CAN YOU BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT 

8818
05:03:30,058 --> 05:03:30,658
ASSURANCES YOU ARE WILLING TO 

8819
05:03:30,658 --> 05:03:35,163
GIVE TO KIM JONG-UN? 

8820
05:03:35,163 --> 05:03:35,730
DOES THAT INCLUDE REDUCING 

8821
05:03:35,730 --> 05:03:36,230
MILITARY CAPABILITIES? 

8822
05:03:36,230 --> 05:03:38,300
AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR 

8823
05:03:38,300 --> 05:03:41,303
ANSWER -- 

8824
05:03:41,303 --> 05:03:42,770
>> NO, WE'RE NOT REDUCING 

8825
05:03:42,770 --> 05:03:43,037
ANYTHING. 

8826
05:03:43,037 --> 05:03:43,871
AT SOME POINT I HAVE TO BE 

8827
05:03:43,871 --> 05:03:44,505
HONEST, AND I USED TO SAY THIS 

8828
05:03:44,505 --> 05:03:46,941
DURING MY CAMPAIGN, AS YOU KNOW 

8829
05:03:46,941 --> 05:03:47,541
PROBABLY BETTER THAN MOST, I 

8830
05:03:47,541 --> 05:03:48,142
WANT TO GET OUR SOLDIERS OUT. 

8831
05:03:48,142 --> 05:03:50,178
I WANT TO BRING OUR SOLDIERS 

8832
05:03:50,178 --> 05:03:50,478
BACK HOME. 

8833
05:03:50,478 --> 05:03:51,012
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 32,000 

8834
05:03:51,012 --> 05:03:51,612
SOLDIERS IN SOUTH KOREA, AND 

8835
05:03:51,612 --> 05:03:55,016
I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BRING 

8836
05:03:55,016 --> 05:03:55,383
THEM BACK HOME. 

8837
05:03:55,383 --> 05:03:56,318
BUT THAT'S NOT PART OF THE 

8838
05:03:56,318 --> 05:03:56,751
EQUATION RIGHT NOW. 

8839
05:03:56,751 --> 05:03:58,954
AT SOME POINT I HOPE IT WILL 

8840
05:03:58,954 --> 05:03:59,454
BE, BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. 

8841
05:03:59,454 --> 05:04:00,087
WE WILL BE STOPPING THE WAR 

8842
05:04:00,087 --> 05:04:02,357
GAMES WHICH WILL SAVE US A 

8843
05:04:02,357 --> 05:04:07,062
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY, 

8844
05:04:07,062 --> 05:04:10,232
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE 

8845
05:04:10,232 --> 05:04:10,899
FUTURE NEGOTIATION IS NOT GOING 

8846
05:04:10,899 --> 05:04:14,068
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD, BUT WE'LL 

8847
05:04:14,068 --> 05:04:14,735
BE SAVING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 

8848
05:04:14,735 --> 05:04:18,907
OF MONEY, PLUS I THINK IT'S 

8849
05:04:18,907 --> 05:04:22,477
VERY PROVOCATIVE. 

8850
05:04:22,477 --> 05:04:22,777
YES, JOHN. 

8851
05:04:22,777 --> 05:04:25,413
YES, JOHN, GO AHEAD. 

8852
05:04:25,413 --> 05:04:26,314
OH.

GO AHEAD. 

8854
05:04:26,581 --> 05:04:26,881
I'M SORRY. 

8855
05:04:26,881 --> 05:04:28,049
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOHN

ROBERTS. 

8857
05:04:29,351 --> 05:04:29,751
I LOOKED AT YOU. 

8858
05:04:29,751 --> 05:04:31,118

MR. PRESIDENT, THIS JOINT 

8863

VERIFIABLE OR IRREVERSIBLE 

8865
05:04:39,994 --> 05:04:40,394
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

8866
05:04:40,394 --> 05:04:40,661

UNITED STATES? 

8870
05:04:46,501 --> 05:04:46,935
>> NO, NOT AT ALL. 

8871
05:04:46,935 --> 05:04:49,069
IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT SAID WE 

8872
05:04:49,069 --> 05:04:49,703

8873
05:04:49,703 --> 05:04:52,140
IT WILL BE GONE -- I DON'T

HE ACTUALLY MADE NO 

8941
05:09:57,545 --> 05:09:59,113
CONCESSIONS, THAT HE WAS JUST 

8942
05:09:59,113 --> 05:10:00,114
MEETING WITH THE NORTH KOREAN 

8943
05:10:00,114 --> 05:10:01,983
DICTATOR, BUT THE REALITY IS 

8944
05:10:01,983 --> 05:10:02,984
HE'S SUGGESTED TO REPORTERS 

8945
05:10:02,984 --> 05:10:04,118
REPORTERS THERE THAT HE WILL 

8946
05:10:04,118 --> 05:10:05,085
STOP THOSE WAR GAMES THAT HAVE 

8947
05:10:05,085 --> 05:10:08,623
BEEN ONGOING FOR MANY, MANY 

8948
05:10:08,623 --> 05:10:11,092
YEARS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 

8949
05:10:11,092 --> 05:10:13,194
HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLY 

8950
05:10:13,194 --> 05:10:15,063
REMOVING TROOPS FROM SOUTH 

8951
05:10:15,063 --> 05:10:15,296
KOREA. 

8952
05:10:15,296 --> 05:10:17,065
TWO HUGE CONCESSIONS ONE WOULD 

8953
05:10:17,065 --> 05:10:18,566
SAY, CERTAINLY CHINA AND THE 

8954
05:10:18,566 --> 05:10:19,567
NORTH KOREANS BENEFICIARIES IF 

8955
05:10:19,567 --> 05:10:20,267
THE PRESIDENT DECIDES TO FOLLOW 

8956
05:10:20,267 --> 05:10:20,534
THROUGH. 

8957
05:10:20,534 --> 05:10:21,869
THOSE ARE JUST TWO OF THE 

8958
05:10:21,869 --> 05:10:23,271
BIGGER HEADLINES THAT I COULD 

8959
05:10:23,271 --> 05:10:24,172
SORT OF COME UP WITH. 

8960
05:10:24,172 --> 05:10:26,607
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE 

8961
05:10:26,607 --> 05:10:27,040
CAN UNRAVEL. 

8962
05:10:27,040 --> 05:10:27,708
BUT YOUR TAKE. 

8963
05:10:27,708 --> 05:10:27,975
>> YEAH. 

8964
05:10:27,975 --> 05:10:29,410
AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT THE 

8965
05:10:29,410 --> 05:10:31,345
IDEA THAT HE'S INVITED HIM TO 

8966
05:10:31,345 --> 05:10:33,614
THE WHITE HOUSE IS A SIGN OF 

8967
05:10:33,614 --> 05:10:34,916
LEGITIMACY AND RESPECT THAT HAS 

8968
05:10:34,916 --> 05:10:35,817
NOT BEEN AFFORDED TO OTHER 

8969
05:10:35,817 --> 05:10:36,784
WORLD LEADERS AND CERTAINLY 

8970
05:10:36,784 --> 05:10:39,320
WOULD BE A REAL FEATHER IN HIS 

8971
05:10:39,320 --> 05:10:39,720
CAP AS WELL. 

8972
05:10:39,720 --> 05:10:41,322
AS YOU SAID, LOTS TO UNPACK 

8973
05:10:41,322 --> 05:10:41,522
HERE. 

8974
05:10:41,522 --> 05:10:42,323
AMONG OTHER THINGS, LET'S SORT 

8975
05:10:42,323 --> 05:10:44,392
OF RUN THROUGH IT HERE, HE SAYS 

8976
05:10:44,392 --> 05:10:46,294
THAT U.S. SANCTIONS WILL REMAIN 

8977
05:10:46,294 --> 05:10:49,263
ON NORTH KOREA -- EXISTING U.S. 

8978
05:10:49,263 --> 05:10:50,998
SANCTIONS WILL REMAIN ON NORTH 

8979
05:10:50,998 --> 05:10:53,167
KOREA AS THESE TALKS CONTINUE, 

8980
05:10:53,167 --> 05:10:54,402
AND SUGGESTED THAT HE BATTED 

8981
05:10:54,402 --> 05:10:56,370
AWAY A HANDFUL OF MORE 

8982
05:10:56,370 --> 05:10:57,305
SANCTIONS BECAUSE IT WOULD BE 

8983
05:10:57,305 --> 05:10:58,673
DISRESPECTFUL, SAID THE U.S. 

8984
05:10:58,673 --> 05:11:02,310
WILL END THE WAR GAMES, SAID 

8985
05:11:02,310 --> 05:11:03,811
THAT NORTH KOREA WILL BEGIN 

8986
05:11:03,811 --> 05:11:05,613
DESTROYING ITS MISSILE TESTING 

8987
05:11:05,613 --> 05:11:05,846
SITES. 

8988
05:11:05,846 --> 05:11:06,580
HOW THAT WOULD BE VERIFIED, 

8989
05:11:06,580 --> 05:11:08,116
HOWEVER, HE WOULD NOT SAY OR 

8990
05:11:08,116 --> 05:11:09,617
WOULD NOT SHARE. 

8991
05:11:09,617 --> 05:11:11,185
THE IDEA THAT THOUSANDS OF 

8992
05:11:11,185 --> 05:11:13,287
MISSING PEOPLE FROM THE KOREAN 

8993
05:11:13,287 --> 05:11:14,155
CONFLICT WILL BE RETURNED, 

8994
05:11:14,155 --> 05:11:16,657
AGAIN, WHETHER OR NOT THEY KNOW 

8995
05:11:16,657 --> 05:11:18,826
THAT THOSE THOUSANDS ARE STILL 

8996
05:11:18,826 --> 05:11:19,761
WITHIN NORTH KOREA'S BORDERS, 

8997
05:11:19,761 --> 05:11:24,098
HOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN, WHEN 

8998
05:11:24,098 --> 05:11:24,798
THAT WOULD HAPPEN WAS UNCLEAR. 

8999
05:11:24,798 --> 05:11:26,367
DID SAY THAT TALKS BETWEEN THE 

9000
05:11:26,367 --> 05:11:27,134
TWO COUNTRIES WOULD CONTINUE 

9001
05:11:27,134 --> 05:11:27,435
NEXT WEEK. 

9002
05:11:27,435 --> 05:11:30,271
AND BY ROPING IN THE SOUTH 

9003
05:11:30,271 --> 05:11:31,873
KOREAN LEADER, THE CHINESE, THE 

9004
05:11:31,873 --> 05:11:34,708
JAPANESE UNDOUBTEDLY THEY'LL 

9005
05:11:34,708 --> 05:11:35,309
REMAIN ENGAGED IN ALL THIS AS 

9006
05:11:35,309 --> 05:11:38,246
WELL SUGGESTED HE WOULD VISIT 

9007
05:11:38,246 --> 05:11:38,846
PYONGYANG AT SOME POINT DOWN 

9008
05:11:38,846 --> 05:11:39,447
THE ROAD, AND DID EXTEND THAT 

9009
05:11:39,447 --> 05:11:39,714
INVITE TO 

9010
05:11:39,714 --> 05:11:43,150
CHAIRMAN KIM TO VISIT THE WHITE 

9011
05:11:43,150 --> 05:11:43,383
HOUSE. 

9012
05:11:43,383 --> 05:11:45,519
AND ADMITTED DENUCLEARIZATION 

9013
05:11:45,519 --> 05:11:47,087
WILL TAKE A LONG TIME, SAYING 

9014
05:11:47,087 --> 05:11:47,688
THAT SCIENTIFICALLY HE'S BEEN 

9015
05:11:47,688 --> 05:11:48,322
TOLD IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME, 

9016
05:11:48,322 --> 05:11:50,358
BUT LATER SUGGESTED IT COULD GO 

9017
05:11:50,358 --> 05:11:53,961
PRETTY FAST. 

9018
05:11:53,961 --> 05:11:55,362
SO TAKE IT EITHER WAY YOU'D 

9019
05:11:55,362 --> 05:11:58,332
LIKE. 

9020
05:11:58,332 --> 05:12:01,035
DID SUGGEST THINGS WITH THE G7 

9021
05:12:01,035 --> 05:12:01,668
NATIONS DIDN'T GO AS BAD AS YOU 

9022
05:12:01,668 --> 05:12:03,470
MIGHT THINK, THAT IN FACT THE 

9023
05:12:03,470 --> 05:12:04,104
CONVERSATIONS WERE CONSTRUCTIVE 

9024
05:12:04,104 --> 05:12:04,438
AND CORDIAL. 

9025
05:12:04,438 --> 05:12:06,941
AND IF YOU NEEDED ANY REMINDER 

9026
05:12:06,941 --> 05:12:07,875
THAT THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT 

9027
05:12:07,875 --> 05:12:08,509
CLOSELY AND CAREFULLY CONSUMES 

9028
05:12:08,509 --> 05:12:09,109
THAT THAT IS SAID AND WRITTEN 

9029
05:12:09,109 --> 05:12:11,445
BY THE NEWS MEDIA, YOU GOT IT 

9030
05:12:11,445 --> 05:12:12,112
YET AGAIN TODAY AS HE RECALLED 

9031
05:12:12,112 --> 05:12:15,016
SPECIFIC STORIES THAT HAVE BEEN 

9032
05:12:15,016 --> 05:12:18,686
WRITTEN IN THE PAST BY VARIOUS 

9033
05:12:18,686 --> 05:12:19,320
REPORTERS THAT WERE THERE 

9034
05:12:19,320 --> 05:12:19,720
QUESTIONING HIM. 

9035
05:12:19,720 --> 05:12:20,354
VLAD, WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK THIS 

9036
05:12:20,354 --> 05:12:22,890
WITH OUR COLLEAGUE MARK WHO 

9037
05:12:22,890 --> 05:12:23,524
TRACKS THESE THINGS CLOSELY, I 

9038
05:12:23,524 --> 05:12:23,757
CANNOT 

9039
05:12:23,757 --> 05:12:25,158
RECALL SINCE HE BECAME 

9040
05:12:25,158 --> 05:12:25,726
PRESIDENT MR. TRUMP TAKING 

9041
05:12:25,726 --> 05:12:27,261
QUESTIONS FROM EVERY NEWS 

9042
05:12:27,261 --> 05:12:28,362
OUTLET THAT SITS IN THE FRONT 

9043
05:12:28,362 --> 05:12:32,233
ROW OF THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS 

9044
05:12:32,233 --> 05:12:32,833
BRIEFING ROOM, AMONG OTHERS. 

9045
05:12:32,833 --> 05:12:36,570
THIS IS A SIGN PERHAPS THAT 

9046
05:12:36,570 --> 05:12:40,207
HE'S GOING TO BE MORE 

9047
05:12:40,207 --> 05:12:41,909
WILLING TO DO THAT OR PERHAPS 

9048
05:12:41,909 --> 05:12:42,643
JUST A SIGN THAT ON TODAY, A 

9049
05:12:42,643 --> 05:12:43,243
HISTORIC DAY FOR HIM FOR HIS 

9050
05:12:43,243 --> 05:12:43,877
ADMINISTRATION, HE'S WILLING TO 

9051
05:12:43,877 --> 05:12:44,545
ENGAGE THE PRESS A LITTLE MORE 

9052
05:12:44,545 --> 05:12:44,845
THAN USUAL. 

9053
05:12:44,845 --> 05:12:47,048
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, CLEARLY THE 

9054
05:12:47,048 --> 05:12:47,615
PRESIDENT FEELING MUCH MORE 

9055
05:12:47,615 --> 05:12:50,351
COMFORTABLE, FEELING THAT HE IS 

9056
05:12:50,351 --> 05:12:54,422
IN CONTROL OF THE WHITE HOUSE, 

9057
05:12:54,422 --> 05:12:58,158
OF HIS ADMINISTRATION, OF HIS 

9058
05:12:58,158 --> 05:12:58,759
DESTINY AND THAT PERHAPS HAS 

9059
05:12:58,759 --> 05:12:59,393
LED HIM TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE 

9060
05:12:59,393 --> 05:13:00,027
WITH SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE 

9061
05:13:00,027 --> 05:13:01,529
PRESS WHO IN THE PAST HE HAS 

9062
05:13:01,529 --> 05:13:01,696
NOT 

9063
05:13:01,696 --> 05:13:02,330
CHOSEN TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM. 

9064
05:13:02,330 --> 05:13:03,231
CBS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR AND 

9065
05:13:03,231 --> 05:13:03,965

05:13:03,965 --> 05:13:05,733
THE WHITE HOUSE ZEKE MILLER 

9067
05:13:05,733 --> 05:13:06,300
JOINS ME ON THE TELEPHONE. 

9068
05:13:06,300 --> 05:13:10,538
ZEKE, YOU WERE IN THAT ROOM 

9069
05:13:10,538 --> 05:13:11,172
WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS TAKING 

9070
05:13:11,172 --> 05:13:11,472
QUESTIONS. 

9071
05:13:11,472 --> 05:13:14,375
I MEAN, AGAIN, THIS WAS A LONG 

9072
05:13:14,375 --> 05:13:19,012
PRESS CONFERENCE, AN HOUR AND 

9073

>> THIS, YOU KNOW, EPITOMIZED 

9075
05:13:32,426 --> 05:13:32,826
THE PRESIDENT. 

9076
05:13:32,826 --> 05:13:33,860
THE PRESIDENT SEEN ON THE 

9077
05:13:33,860 --> 05:13:35,563
INTERNATIONAL STAGE NOW FOR A 

9078
05:13:35,563 --> 05:13:42,303
YEAR AND A HALF, IN AMERICAN 

9079
05:13:42,303 --> 05:13:42,937
LIFE, FOR THREE YEARS, BEEN IN 

9080
05:13:42,937 --> 05:13:44,338
OUR LIVING ROOMS AND TVs FOR 

9081
05:13:44,338 --> 05:13:44,671
TWO DECADES. 

9082
05:13:44,671 --> 05:13:48,709
THIS IS THE DEAL MAKER THAT 

9083
05:13:48,709 --> 05:13:54,816
SAID HE ALONE COULD FIX IT, 

9084
05:13:54,816 --> 05:13:55,416
GETTING IN THE ROOM WITH KIM 

9085
05:13:55,416 --> 05:13:55,983
JONG-UN, THIS AUTOCRAT AND 

9086
05:13:55,983 --> 05:13:58,385
TRYING TO CUT THIS AGREEMENT TO

05:13:58,385 --> 05:13:59,286
BRING BACK THIS INDETRACTABLE 

9088
05:13:59,286 --> 05:13:59,620
GLOBAL ISSUE. 

9089
05:13:59,620 --> 05:14:01,422
THE QUESTION IS DID HE 

9090
05:14:01,422 --> 05:14:01,822
ACCOMPLISH THAT? 

9091
05:14:01,822 --> 05:14:02,456
THE DEVIL IS IN DETAILS THERE. 

9092
05:14:02,456 --> 05:14:03,391
THERE ARE A LOT OF INDICATIONS 

9093
05:14:03,391 --> 05:14:05,292
THAT IN FACT THAT'S WHAT THE 

9094
05:14:05,292 --> 05:14:06,326
PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO 

9095
05:14:06,326 --> 05:14:06,960
ACCOMPLISH, BUT CERTAINLY FROM 

9096
05:14:06,960 --> 05:14:07,527

IT SEEMED TO BE ONE OF THE BEST 

9100
05:14:11,031 --> 05:14:12,700
DAYS IF NOT THE BEST DAY OF HIS 

9101
05:14:12,700 --> 05:14:13,300
PRESIDENCY, SORT OF FREE-FORM 

9102
05:14:13,300 --> 05:14:13,834
PRESS CONFERENCE, TAKING 

9103
05:14:13,834 --> 05:14:14,568
QUESTIONS LIKE HE HASN'T SINCE 

9104

THE VERY EARLIEST DAYS OF THE 

9105
05:14:19,072 --> 05:14:19,706
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, MAYBE

CONTROLLING HIS OWN DESTINY 

9111
05:14:25,712 --> 05:14:25,913
HERE. 

9112
05:14:25,913 --> 05:14:30,418
>> YOU KNOW, ZEKE, I MEAN,

MADE, SOME OF THE ANSWERS THAT 

9119
05:14:38,359 --> 05:14:39,459
HE GAVE TO REPORTERS THERE, 

9120
05:14:39,459 --> 05:14:42,863
BUT, AGAIN, THE IDEA THAT THE 

9121
05:14:42,863 --> 05:14:43,363
U.S. WILL STOP MILITARY 

9122
05:14:43,363 --> 05:14:45,399
EXERCISES ON THE KOREAN 

9123
05:14:45,399 --> 05:14:47,234
PENINSULA IN THE REGION, 

9124
05:14:47,234 --> 05:14:47,534
PLEDGES TO 

9125
05:14:47,534 --> 05:14:50,470
REMOVE TROOPS AT SOME POINT 

9126
05:14:50,470 --> 05:14:51,639
SAYING THEY COST BILLIONS OF 

9127
05:14:51,639 --> 05:14:54,808
DOLLARS, THAT IT'S VERY 

9128
05:14:54,808 --> 05:14:55,442
EXPENSIVE, NO NEW SANCTIONS IN 

9129
05:14:55,442 --> 05:14:56,043
PLACE, AND ALL WE ARE GETTING 

9130
05:14:56,043 --> 05:14:59,614
APPEARS TO BE WHAT IS IN THIS 

9131
05:14:59,614 --> 05:15:00,781
DOCUMENT, THIS DOCUMENT WHICH 

9132
05:15:00,781 --> 05:15:06,954
IN EFFECT IS A VAGUE PROMISE TO 

9133
05:15:06,954 --> 05:15:08,088
DENUCLEARIZE AT SOME POINT. 

9134
05:15:08,088 --> 05:15:08,622
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 

9135
05:15:08,622 --> 05:15:14,362
YOU KNOW, IF THIS DOCUMENT WERE 

9136
05:15:14,362 --> 05:15:15,295
TO BE COMPLETELY AND FULLY 

9137
05:15:15,295 --> 05:15:17,064
EXECUTED TO ITS FULLEST 

9138
05:15:17,064 --> 05:15:17,631
CONCLUSION, THIS WOULD BE A 

9139
05:15:17,631 --> 05:15:18,599
MASSIVE SUCCESS BY THE 

9140
05:15:18,599 --> 05:15:18,899
PRESIDENT. 

9141
05:15:18,899 --> 05:15:19,533
IF NORTH KOREA WERE TO GIVE UP 

9142
05:15:19,533 --> 05:15:20,133
ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS, HOWEVER 

9143
05:15:20,133 --> 05:15:26,340
LONG THAT PROCESS WOULD BE, 

9144
05:15:26,340 --> 05:15:29,777
MASSIVE FOREIGN POLICY SUCCESS 

9145
05:15:29,777 --> 05:15:30,344
FOR THIS PRESIDENT, NOBODY 

9146
05:15:30,344 --> 05:15:30,711
DISPUTES THAT. 

9147
05:15:30,711 --> 05:15:32,346
BUT SIGNING A DOCUMENT IS VERY 

9148
05:15:32,346 --> 05:15:32,846
DIFFERENT FROM ACTUALLY 

9149
05:15:32,846 --> 05:15:33,447
ACCOMPLISHING THAT GOAL, AND 

9150
05:15:33,447 --> 05:15:34,949
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE IS 

9151
05:15:34,949 --> 05:15:35,582
ELEVATED KIM JONG-UN, ELEVATED 

9152
05:15:35,582 --> 05:15:38,185
NORTH KOREA ON THE 

9153
05:15:38,185 --> 05:15:38,752
INTERNATIONAL STAGE, ENDING 

9154
05:15:38,752 --> 05:15:39,353
GENERATIONS OF ISOLATION FOR 

9155
05:15:39,353 --> 05:15:39,920
THAT GOVERNMENT, AND MAKING 

9156
05:15:39,920 --> 05:15:44,424
SOME KEY SANCTIONS THAT ARE 

9157
05:15:44,424 --> 05:15:52,299
GOING TO RANKLE KEY U.S. ALLIES 

9158
05:15:52,299 --> 05:15:58,906
AND AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE 

9159
05:15:58,906 --> 05:16:01,976
THIS QUESTIONS THIS IS NOT JUST 

9160
05:16:01,976 --> 05:16:02,576
ABOUT SOUTH KOREA OBVIOUSLY [ 

9161
05:16:02,576 --> 05:16:03,210
INAUDIBLE  ] OTHER ALLIES AROUND

9162
05:16:03,210 --> 05:16:04,211
THE WORLD WHO WILL COME TO 

9163
05:16:04,211 --> 05:16:05,079
QUESTION WHETHER THEY ARE 

9164
05:16:05,079 --> 05:16:05,713
ASSURANCES BY THE UNITED STATES 

9165
05:16:05,713 --> 05:16:06,013
WILL LAST. 

9166
05:16:06,013 --> 05:16:06,613
SO FOR THE PRESIDENT -- YOU 

9167
05:16:06,613 --> 05:16:07,247
KNOW, IT'LL COME DOWN TO IS IT 

9168
05:16:07,247 --> 05:16:07,514
WORTH IT? 

9169
05:16:07,514 --> 05:16:08,282
WE HEARD HIM SAY ELEVATING KIM 

9170
05:16:08,282 --> 05:16:13,154
ON THE STAGE AND MAKING THOSE 

9171
05:16:13,154 --> 05:16:13,754
PROMISES, THOUGH COMMITMENTS 

9172
05:16:13,754 --> 05:16:16,223
ARE WORTH IT IF HE CAN ACTUALLY 

9173
05:16:16,223 --> 05:16:16,690
ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. 

9174
05:16:16,690 --> 05:16:18,960
IF NOT, IN SIX MONTHS, IN SIX 

9175
05:16:18,960 --> 05:16:19,826
YEARS, WE MAY BE HAVING A VERY 

9176
05:16:19,826 --> 05:16:20,460
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION LOOKING 

9177
05:16:20,460 --> 05:16:21,562
BACK AT THIS MOMENT VERY 

9178
05:16:21,562 --> 05:16:22,129
DIFFERENT AND THE PRESIDENT 

9179
05:16:22,129 --> 05:16:23,330
HINTED AT THAT SAYING HE WOULD 

9180
05:16:23,330 --> 05:16:25,199
PROBABLY TRY TO FIND AN EXCUSE, 

9181
05:16:25,199 --> 05:16:26,233
SOMEBODY ELSE TO BLAME IT ON, 

9182
05:16:26,233 --> 05:16:27,601
BUT THIS IS A MASSIVE RISK BY 

9183
05:16:27,601 --> 05:16:28,202
THIS PRESIDENT AND IT'LL TAKE 

9184
05:16:28,202 --> 05:16:32,840
SOME TIME TO SEE IF IT'LL PAY 

9185
05:16:32,840 --> 05:16:38,946
OFF OR NOT. 

9186
05:16:38,946 --> 05:16:39,579
>> ZEKE, ED, STAND BY, ISAAC, 

9187
05:16:39,579 --> 05:16:39,846
STAND BY. 

9188
05:16:39,846 --> 05:16:40,581
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF 

9189
05:16:40,581 --> 05:16:41,816
THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT 

9190
05:16:41,816 --> 05:16:42,216
THIS VERY ISSUE. 

9191
05:16:42,216 --> 05:16:42,683
LET'S PLAY THAT. 

9192
05:16:42,683 --> 05:16:43,316
>> I WANT TO GET OUR SOLDIERS 

9193
05:16:43,316 --> 05:16:43,517
OUT. 

9194
05:16:43,517 --> 05:16:47,054
I WANT TO BRING OUR SOLDIERS 

9195
05:16:47,054 --> 05:16:47,354
BACK HOME. 

9196
05:16:47,354 --> 05:16:50,257
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 32,000 

9197
05:16:50,257 --> 05:16:50,857
SOLDIERS IN SOUTH KOREA, AND 

9198
05:16:50,857 --> 05:16:51,458
I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BRING 

9199
05:16:51,458 --> 05:16:51,825
THEM BACK HOME. 

9200
05:16:51,825 --> 05:16:55,329
BUT THAT'S NOT PART OF THE 

9201
05:16:55,329 --> 05:16:55,763
EQUATION RIGHT NOW. 

9202
05:16:55,763 --> 05:16:57,064
AT SOME POINT I HOPE IT WILL 

9203
05:16:57,064 --> 05:16:57,565
BE, BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. 

9204
05:16:57,565 --> 05:17:00,634
WE WILL BE STOPPING THE WAR 

9205
05:17:00,634 --> 05:17:02,703
GAMES WHICH WILL SAVE US A 

9206
05:17:02,703 --> 05:17:06,907
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY 

9207
05:17:06,907 --> 05:17:07,507
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE 

9208
05:17:07,507 --> 05:17:10,945
FUTURE NEGOTIATION IS NOT GOING 

9209
05:17:10,945 --> 05:17:11,412
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD. 

9210
05:17:11,412 --> 05:17:14,381
BUT WE'LL BE SAVING A 

9211
05:17:14,381 --> 05:17:15,082
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. 

9212
05:17:15,082 --> 05:17:20,087
PLUS I THINK IT'S VERY 

9213
05:17:20,087 --> 05:17:20,420
PROVOCATIVE. 

9214
05:17:20,420 --> 05:17:25,259
>> ISAAC, TO YOU NOW. 

9215
05:17:25,259 --> 05:17:26,960
WHEN YOU HEARD THAT, THAT I 

9216
05:17:26,960 --> 05:17:27,594
THINK -- WE BOTH LOOKED AT EACH 

9217
05:17:27,594 --> 05:17:30,064
OTHER AND SAID THAT WAS 

9218
05:17:30,064 --> 05:17:30,664
SOMETHING WE NEVER HEARD WAS 

9219
05:17:30,664 --> 05:17:31,298
EVEN ON THE TABLE, THE IDEA OF 

9220
05:17:31,298 --> 05:17:31,865
THE UNITED STATES STOPPING 

9221
05:17:31,865 --> 05:17:32,499
THESE WAR GAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN 

9222
05:17:32,499 --> 05:17:33,100
IN PLAY FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. 

9223
05:17:33,100 --> 05:17:34,334
WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU 

9224
05:17:34,334 --> 05:17:34,634
HEARD THAT? 

9225
05:17:34,634 --> 05:17:38,339
>> I THINK THROUGHOUT THIS 

9226
05:17:38,339 --> 05:17:39,906
PRESS CONFERENCE, AND, 

9227
05:17:39,906 --> 05:17:42,743
ACTUALLY, THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE 

9228
05:17:42,743 --> 05:17:43,310
NINE-HOUR PERIOD THAT WE'VE 

9229
05:17:43,310 --> 05:17:43,944
BEEN WATCHING THIS, I HAVE FELT 

9230
05:17:43,944 --> 05:17:47,982
JUST SO SHOCKED, AND THIS HAS 

9231
05:17:47,982 --> 05:17:49,917
BEEN SUCH A SURPRISING TURN OF 

9232
05:17:49,917 --> 05:17:50,150
EVENTS. 

9233
05:17:50,150 --> 05:17:50,751
AND I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND 

9234
05:17:50,751 --> 05:17:54,221
WHY TRUMP FELT THE NEED TO STOP 

9235
05:17:54,221 --> 05:17:54,588
THE WAR GAMES. 

9236
05:17:54,588 --> 05:17:55,188
THEY ARE SOMETHING THAT SHOWS 

9237
05:17:55,188 --> 05:17:55,822
U.S. RESOLVE IN THE REGION, NOT 

9238
05:17:55,822 --> 05:18:02,229
ONLY TO NORTH KOREA, BUT ALSO 

9239
05:18:02,229 --> 05:18:02,796
MORE IMPORTANTLY TO CHINA. 

9240
05:18:02,796 --> 05:18:05,832
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S THIS 

9241
05:18:05,832 --> 05:18:06,934
WHOLE IDEA OF TRUMP AS THIS 

9242
05:18:06,934 --> 05:18:08,235
GREAT NEGOTIATOR AND YET HE 

9243
05:18:08,235 --> 05:18:08,735
GAVE UP ONE OF THE MOST 

9244
05:18:08,735 --> 05:18:13,306
IMPORTANT CARDS WE HAVE IN THE 

9245
05:18:13,306 --> 05:18:13,874
REGION SEEMINGLY FOR FREE. 

9246
05:18:13,874 --> 05:18:14,942
SO I THINK I AM BAFFLED BY THAT 

9247
05:18:14,942 --> 05:18:15,409
AND I'M BAFFLED BY A 

9248
05:18:15,409 --> 05:18:20,381
LOT OF THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF 

9249
05:18:20,381 --> 05:18:20,748
TRUMP'S MOUTH. 

9250
05:18:20,748 --> 05:18:22,950
>> WE'VE BEEN ON THE AIR FOR 

9251
05:18:22,950 --> 05:18:23,517
ABOUT NINE HOURS NOW, SO I 

9252
05:18:23,517 --> 05:18:29,423
DON'T RECALL WHO OF OUR GUESTS, 

9253
05:18:29,423 --> 05:18:30,558
MAYBE IT WAS YOU, THAT SAID 

9254
05:18:30,558 --> 05:18:31,391
THAT -- SOMEBODY MENTIONED 

9255
05:18:31,391 --> 05:18:32,158
THOSE WAR GAMES AND SAID IT 

9256
05:18:32,158 --> 05:18:32,826
ACTUALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 

9257
05:18:32,826 --> 05:18:35,062
NORTH KOREA OR WITH CHINA, IT'S 

9258
05:18:35,062 --> 05:18:35,663
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND 

9259
05:18:35,663 --> 05:18:36,163
SOUTH KOREA, THAT'S THE 

9260
05:18:36,163 --> 05:18:38,498
AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE WITH THE 

9261
05:18:38,498 --> 05:18:39,066
SOUTH KOREANS, AND IN SOME 

9262
05:18:39,066 --> 05:18:42,636
CASES THE JAPANESE TO CONDUCT 

9263
05:18:42,636 --> 05:18:43,403
THESE WAR GAMES, AND YET THE 

9264
05:18:43,403 --> 05:18:43,970
PRESIDENT -- IF KIM JONG-UN 

9265
05:18:43,970 --> 05:18:44,471
ASKED FOR THIS AND THE 

9266
05:18:44,471 --> 05:18:45,305
PRESIDENT GAVE THAT UP FOR SOME 

9267
05:18:45,305 --> 05:18:46,974
VAGUE PROMISES TO DENUCLEARIZE 

9268
05:18:46,974 --> 05:18:47,641
AT SOME POINT, THE PRESIDENT AT 

9269
05:18:47,641 --> 05:18:48,642
ONE POINT WAS ASKED HOW DO YOU 

9270
05:18:48,642 --> 05:18:49,042
ENSURE THAT, THE 

9271
05:18:49,042 --> 05:18:49,676
PRESIDENT SAYING, WELL, HOW CAN 

9272
05:18:49,676 --> 05:18:54,481
YOU ENSURE ANYTHING, IT SEEMED 

9273
05:18:54,481 --> 05:18:54,782
REMARKABLE. 

9274
05:18:54,782 --> 05:18:55,049
>> RIGHT. 

9275
05:18:55,049 --> 05:18:55,649
I THINK HE SAID THAT HOW CAN 

9276
05:18:55,649 --> 05:18:56,283
YOU ENSURE WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO 

9277
05:18:56,283 --> 05:18:58,251
SIT DOWN YOU ACTUALLY SIT DOWN. 

9278
05:18:58,251 --> 05:18:58,518
>> YEAH. 

9279
05:18:58,518 --> 05:19:02,389
>> AND, AGAIN, YOU KIND OF WANT 

9280
05:19:02,389 --> 05:19:02,956
TO THINK, OKAY, WE'VE BEEN 

9281
05:19:02,956 --> 05:19:05,525
TALKING THIS FOR SO LONG, WE 

9282
05:19:05,525 --> 05:19:06,126
MUST BE HEARING THINGS, BUT I 

9283
05:19:06,126 --> 05:19:06,727
THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE 

9284
05:19:06,727 --> 05:19:07,394
WAS SAYING AND THE POINT HE WAS 

9285
05:19:07,394 --> 05:19:07,994
EXACTLY MAKING ABOUT HOW YOU 

9286
05:19:07,994 --> 05:19:08,595
CAN'T ENSURE ANYTHING, AND SO 

9287
05:19:08,595 --> 05:19:08,862
THEREFORE 

9288
05:19:08,862 --> 05:19:13,067
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE UP THIS 

9289
05:19:13,067 --> 05:19:13,634
REALLY IMPORTANT DIPLOMATIC 

9290
05:19:13,634 --> 05:19:14,335
RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE AND 

9291
05:19:14,335 --> 05:19:16,904
THIS VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR 

9292
05:19:16,904 --> 05:19:18,906
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOUTH KOREA 

9293
05:19:18,906 --> 05:19:22,943
SO THAT NORTH KOREA MAY 

9294
05:19:22,943 --> 05:19:26,914
EVENTUALLY AT SOME POINT LATER 

9295
05:19:26,914 --> 05:19:27,548
IN THE FUTURE DO SOMETHING THAT 

9296
05:19:27,548 --> 05:19:30,684
THEY'VE ALREADY PROMISED  TO DO 

9297
05:19:30,684 --> 05:19:31,084
BUT HAVEN'T DONE. 

9298
05:19:31,084 --> 05:19:31,651
>> ED O'KEEFE, YOU'RE STILL 

9299
05:19:31,651 --> 05:19:31,918
WITH US. 

9300
05:19:31,918 --> 05:19:32,552
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW YOU THINK 

9301
05:19:32,552 --> 05:19:33,119
HAVING COVERED CONGRESS FOR 

9302
05:19:33,119 --> 05:19:35,055
MANY, MANY YEARS, HOW DO YOU 

9303
05:19:35,055 --> 05:19:38,859
THINK THIS IS GOING TO PLAY 

9304
05:19:38,859 --> 05:19:39,493
WITH SOME CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS 

9305
05:19:39,493 --> 05:19:41,595
OF CONGRESS, BOTH REPUBLICAN 

9306
05:19:41,595 --> 05:19:42,962
AND DEMOCRAT WHO ARE GOING TO 

9307
05:19:42,962 --> 05:19:43,530
LOOK AT SOME OF THE REMARKS 

9308
05:19:43,530 --> 05:19:44,164
THAT THE PRESIDENT MADE IN THIS 

9309
05:19:44,164 --> 05:19:44,798
PRESS CONFERENCE AND SAY, WOA, 

9310
05:19:44,798 --> 05:19:47,001
WHOA, WHOA, WE -- THE IDEA THAT 

9311
05:19:47,001 --> 05:19:47,601
WE WOULD STOP PROTECTING OUR 

9312
05:19:47,601 --> 05:19:48,736
ALLIES BY REMOVING TROOPS FROM 

9313
05:19:48,736 --> 05:19:49,369
THE PENINSULA OR STOPPING THESE 

9314
05:19:49,369 --> 05:19:50,604
WAR GAMES IS NOT SOMETHING THAT 

9315
05:19:50,604 --> 05:19:51,204
WE THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD 

9316
05:19:51,204 --> 05:19:51,671
BE SUGGESTING OR EVEN 

9317
05:19:51,671 --> 05:19:55,442
ADVOCATING FOR, ALL THAT LOOKS 

9318
05:19:55,442 --> 05:19:57,778
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD IS 

9319
05:19:57,778 --> 05:19:59,313
THAT WE'RE ABANDONING OUR 

9320
05:19:59,313 --> 05:20:02,616
ALLIES, SOUTH KOREA WHILE 

9321
05:20:02,616 --> 05:20:03,250
EMBOLDENING THE NORTH KOREANS? 

9322
05:20:03,250 --> 05:20:03,517
>> YEAH. 

9323
05:20:03,517 --> 05:20:07,054
WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE A FAIR BIT 

9324
05:20:07,054 --> 05:20:08,622
OF SKEPTICISM FROM MEMBERS OF 

9325
05:20:08,622 --> 05:20:08,955
BOTH PARTIES. 

9326
05:20:08,955 --> 05:20:12,459
BUT I THINK WE'LL SEE SOME AT 

9327
05:20:12,459 --> 05:20:13,027
LEAST MEASURED SUPPORT FROM 

9328
05:20:13,027 --> 05:20:14,395
CERTAIN REPUBLICANS. 

9329
05:20:14,395 --> 05:20:16,196
SOME OF HIS BIGGEST DEFENDERS 

9330
05:20:16,196 --> 05:20:18,932
ON CAPITOL HILL ARE ALSO SOME 

9331
05:20:18,932 --> 05:20:19,466
OF THIS REGIME'S BIGGEST 

9332
05:20:19,466 --> 05:20:21,201
CRITICS, THE NORTH KOREAN 

9333
05:20:21,201 --> 05:20:21,735
REGIME'S BIGGEST CRITICS. 

9334
05:20:21,735 --> 05:20:24,605
I'M THINKING OF ENJOYS LIKE TOM 

9335
05:20:24,605 --> 05:20:25,172
COTTON -- LIKE GUYS OF TOM 

9336
05:20:25,172 --> 05:20:27,140
COTTON OF ARKANSAS OR OTHER 

9337
05:20:27,140 --> 05:20:30,945
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE PRETTY 

9338
05:20:30,945 --> 05:20:31,545
OUTSPOKEN ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 

9339
05:20:31,545 --> 05:20:32,445
YOU DID HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY 

9340
05:20:32,445 --> 05:20:33,079
HE'D LIKE TO ENGAGE CONGRESS ON 

9341
05:20:33,079 --> 05:20:35,015
THAT, WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK 

9342
05:20:35,015 --> 05:20:38,585
LIKE, WHEN AND HOW REMAINS TO 

9343
05:20:38,585 --> 05:20:38,852
BE SEEN. 

9344
05:20:38,852 --> 05:20:40,220
LET ME JUST READ TO YOU A BIT, 

9345
05:20:40,220 --> 05:20:46,460
VLAD, FROM A STATEMENT THAT WAS 

9346
05:20:46,460 --> 05:20:47,227
PUT OUT LAST NIGHT BY TOP HOUSE 

9347
05:20:47,227 --> 05:20:50,797
DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE ABOUT AS 

9348
05:20:50,797 --> 05:20:51,431
MUCH INFLUENCE OVER THIS AS YOU 

9349
05:20:51,431 --> 05:20:55,035
AND I DO, FRANKLY, IN THE WAY 

9350
05:20:55,035 --> 05:20:55,602
POLITICS WORK IN WASHINGTON 

9351
05:20:55,602 --> 05:20:56,403
RIGHT NOW, BUT I THINK IT 

9352
05:20:56,403 --> 05:20:57,037
SPEAKS BROADLY TO HOW DEMOCRATS 

9353
05:20:57,037 --> 05:20:58,639
ARE GOING TO FEEL ABOUT LL OF 

9354
05:20:58,639 --> 05:20:59,206
THIS, AND THEY SAY IN PART, 

9355
05:20:59,206 --> 05:21:00,640
SUPPORT FROM OUR PARTNERS AND 

9356
05:21:00,640 --> 05:21:02,676
AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS WILL 

9357
05:21:02,676 --> 05:21:03,277
BE ESSENTIAL TO A SUCCESSFUL 

9358
05:21:03,277 --> 05:21:04,011
OUTCOME TO HIGH-STAKES NUCLEAR 

9359
05:21:04,011 --> 05:21:06,546
DIPLOMACY WITH PYONGYANG, A 

9360
05:21:06,546 --> 05:21:07,180
DEAL THAT PRESERVES THE STATUS 

9361
05:21:07,180 --> 05:21:07,781
QUO IN TERMS OF NORTH KOREA'S 

9362
05:21:07,781 --> 05:21:11,452
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY WHILE 

9363
05:21:11,452 --> 05:21:13,086
TRADING AWAY OUR ABILITY TO 

9364
05:21:13,086 --> 05:21:13,553
COUNTER THEIR NUCLEAR 

9365
05:21:13,553 --> 05:21:13,887
AGGRESSION AND PRO 

9366
05:21:19,059 --> 05:21:23,964
TO 

9367
05:21:24,365 --> 05:21:24,999
ACHIEVE AN AGREEMENT THAT LEADS 

9368
05:21:24,999 --> 05:21:25,799
TO LASTING PEACE WILL REQUIRE 

9369
05:21:25,799 --> 05:21:26,366
THE SUPPORT OF OUR ALLIES. 

9370
05:21:26,366 --> 05:21:27,000
IN ESSENCE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING 

9371
05:21:27,000 --> 05:21:27,634
HERE IS WE'RE COOL WITH THIS IF 

9372
05:21:27,634 --> 05:21:28,468
THE REST OF THE WORLD IS COOL 

9373
05:21:28,468 --> 05:21:28,768
WITH THIS. 

9374
05:21:28,768 --> 05:21:29,402
AND IF THEY AREN'T, WE'RE GOING 

9375
05:21:29,402 --> 05:21:30,003
TO HAVE A LOT OF SKEPTICISM. 

9376
05:21:30,003 --> 05:21:34,942
I SUSPECT IN THE COMING DAYS 

9377
05:21:34,942 --> 05:21:36,743
THERE WILL BE SOME 

9378
05:21:36,743 --> 05:21:38,278
BRIEFINGS FOR AT LEAST SENIOR 

9379
05:21:38,278 --> 05:21:38,845
LAWMAKERS TO LEARN A LITTLE 

9380
05:21:38,845 --> 05:21:39,947
MORE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THIS, 

9381
05:21:39,947 --> 05:21:43,917
ABOUT THE PATH FORWARD AND 

9382
05:21:43,917 --> 05:21:44,718
POTENTIALLY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT 

9383
05:21:44,718 --> 05:21:46,119
AND SECRETARY POMPEO'S DIRECT 

9384
05:21:46,119 --> 05:21:46,753
INTERACTIONS WITH CHAIRMAN KIM 

9385
05:21:46,753 --> 05:21:48,622
AND HIS CLOSE-KNIT CIRCLE, AND 

9386
05:21:48,622 --> 05:21:49,189
SO WE MAY START TO LEARN A 

9387
05:21:49,189 --> 05:21:54,194
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT IN THE 

9388
05:21:54,194 --> 05:21:54,527
COMING DAYS. 

9389
05:21:54,527 --> 05:21:55,061
I WOULD ONLY ADD TO WHAT 

9390
05:21:55,061 --> 05:21:58,532
ISAAC'S CONCERN WAS THERE ABOUT 

9391
05:21:58,532 --> 05:21:58,899
THE WAR GAMES. 

9392
05:21:58,899 --> 05:22:00,934
YOU KNOW, I THINK AS MUCH AS WE 

9393
05:22:00,934 --> 05:22:01,368
ARE SKEPTICAL THAT 

9394
05:22:01,368 --> 05:22:02,602
THE NORTH KOREANS ARE GOING TO 

9395
05:22:02,602 --> 05:22:03,170
DO ANY OF THIS, WE PROBABLY 

9396
05:22:03,170 --> 05:22:04,204
SHOULD BE JUST AS SKEPTICAL 

9397
05:22:04,204 --> 05:22:04,738
THAT WE WOULD EVER REALLY 

9398
05:22:04,738 --> 05:22:08,375
CONSIDER DOING THOSE THINGS 

9399
05:22:08,375 --> 05:22:10,544
UNTIL WE SEE SOME VERIFIABLE 

9400
05:22:10,544 --> 05:22:11,344
ACTION BY THE NORTH KOREANS 

9401
05:22:11,344 --> 05:22:15,549
BECAUSE IF HE IS PICKING UP THE 

9402
05:22:15,549 --> 05:22:19,586
PHONE TO SPEAK NEXT WITH THE 

9403
05:22:19,586 --> 05:22:22,055
SOUTH KOREAN AND -- WITH THE 

9404
05:22:22,055 --> 05:22:23,056
SOUTH KOREAN LEADER, ONE OF THE 

9405
05:22:23,056 --> 05:22:25,392
FIRST THINGS YOU CAN BET THAT 

9406
05:22:25,392 --> 05:22:26,026
THAT PHONE CALL WILL INCLUDE IS 

9407
05:22:26,026 --> 05:22:28,128
A QUESTION ABOUT, WAIT, WE'RE 

9408
05:22:28,128 --> 05:22:28,628
ENDING THOSE WAR GAMES? 

9409
05:22:28,628 --> 05:22:30,697
THAT'S PART OF OUR DEAL, NOT 

9410
05:22:30,697 --> 05:22:31,398
PART OF YOUR DEAL WITH THEM. 

9411
05:22:31,398 --> 05:22:31,998
SO I GOTTA BELIEVE THAT THERE 

9412
05:22:31,998 --> 05:22:32,632
WILL BE -- THERE WOULD 

9413
05:22:32,632 --> 05:22:35,235
BE A WHILE AT LEAST UNTIL THAT 

9414
05:22:35,235 --> 05:22:35,802
IS COMPLETELY TAKEN OFF THE 

9415
05:22:35,802 --> 05:22:36,035
TABLE. 

9416
05:22:36,035 --> 05:22:36,970
AND AS I RECALL, ISAAC, THOSE 

9417
05:22:36,970 --> 05:22:42,609
ARE ANNUAL WAR GAMES, RIGHT? 

9418
05:22:42,609 --> 05:22:43,076
THEY'RE NOT ONGOING. 

9419
05:22:43,076 --> 05:22:43,610
>> THERE ARE ANNUAL ONES. 

9420
05:22:43,610 --> 05:22:46,880
I THINK THERE ARE OTHER 

9421
05:22:46,880 --> 05:22:47,413
EXERCISES THAT THE UNITED 

9422
05:22:47,413 --> 05:22:48,014
STATES AND SOUTH KOREA DOES. 

9423
05:22:48,014 --> 05:22:49,750
I THINK THE ONES -- THERE'S 

9424
05:22:49,750 --> 05:22:50,350
PARTICULAR EXERCISES THAT THE 

9425
05:22:50,350 --> 05:22:53,753
NORTH KOREANS HAVE THE LARGEST 

9426
05:22:53,753 --> 05:22:54,087
PROBLEM WITH. 

9427
05:22:54,087 --> 05:22:56,089
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM 

9428
05:22:56,089 --> 05:22:56,723
REALLY SHOULD OR NEED TO BE ON 

9429
05:22:56,723 --> 05:23:02,329
THE TABLE TO NEGOTIATE UNLESS, 

9430
05:23:02,329 --> 05:23:06,132
AS YOU WERE 

9431
05:23:06,132 --> 05:23:07,601
SAYING, WE ARE GETTING CONCRETE 

9432
05:23:07,601 --> 05:23:08,168
DELIVERABLES FROM THE NORTH 

9433
05:23:08,168 --> 05:23:09,870
KOREANS, AND I THINK THAT'S A 

9434
05:23:09,870 --> 05:23:10,170
GOOD POINT. 

9435
05:23:10,170 --> 05:23:10,704
I THINK THE SOUTH KOREAN 

9436
05:23:10,704 --> 05:23:11,204
PRESIDENT, I THINK ALSO 

9437
05:23:11,204 --> 05:23:12,940
SECRETARY MATTIS AND OTHER 

9438
05:23:12,940 --> 05:23:13,607
MEMBERS OF TRUMP'S CABINET ARE 

9439
05:23:13,607 --> 05:23:14,374
GOING TO TRY TO WALK HIM BACK 

9440
05:23:14,374 --> 05:23:14,974
FROM A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT 

9441
05:23:14,974 --> 05:23:17,644
HE SAID IN THIS PRESS 

9442
05:23:17,644 --> 05:23:17,944
CONFERENCE. 

9443
05:23:17,944 --> 05:23:18,478
>> ALL RIGHT. 

9444
05:23:18,478 --> 05:23:20,647
>>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

9445
05:23:20,647 --> 05:23:20,880
BREAK. 

9446
05:23:20,880 --> 05:23:22,950
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL HAVE 

9447
05:23:22,950 --> 05:23:25,452
THE LATEST ON THE HISTORIC 

9448
05:23:25,452 --> 05:23:26,119

9465

ONE.

KIM JONG-UN HAS ALREADY 

9470
05:27:39,338 --> 05:27:39,873
DEPARTED HERE. 

9471
05:27:39,873 --> 05:27:42,943
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A LOT OF

INSTANT ANALYSIS HERE, A LOT OF 

9473
05:27:43,577 --> 05:27:43,944
HAND WRINGING. 

9474
05:27:43,944 --> 05:27:44,711
I THINK BOTTOM LINE AT THIS 

9475
05:27:44,711 --> 05:27:46,146
POINT RIGHT NOW THERE IS THIS 

9476
05:27:46,146 --> 05:27:46,680
FRAMEWORK WHICH HAS BEEN 

9477
05:27:46,680 --> 05:27:47,314
SIGNED, THESE FOUR MAIN POINTS, 

9478
05:27:47,314 --> 05:27:49,082
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO 

9479
05:27:49,082 --> 05:27:49,582
SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. 

9480
05:27:49,582 --> 05:27:50,516
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT 

9481
05:27:50,516 --> 05:27:51,117
SOMETHING HAPPENING NOW NEXT 

9482
05:27:51,117 --> 05:27:51,317
WEEK. 

9483
05:27:51,317 --> 05:27:54,955
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

9484
05:27:54,955 --> 05:27:56,289
BEING ASKED ABOUT WHEN KIM JONG-

9485
05:27:56,289 --> 05:27:56,822
UN POTENTIALLY VISITS THE 

9486
05:27:56,822 --> 05:27:58,725
UNITED STATES, WHEN THE 

9487
05:27:58,725 --> 05:27:59,292
PRESIDENT WOULD POTENTIALLY 

9488
05:27:59,292 --> 05:28:02,128
VISIT PYONGYANG, BUT WE HAVE TO 

9489
05:28:02,128 --> 05:28:02,762
WAIT ON THOSE DETAILS, VLAD. 

9490
05:28:02,762 --> 05:28:03,896
>> JEFF, TALK ABOUT THE -- IF 

9491
05:28:03,896 --> 05:28:06,165
WE TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THE 

9492
05:28:06,165 --> 05:28:06,766
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WE JUST 

9493
05:28:06,766 --> 05:28:10,803
WITNESSED WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 

9494
05:28:10,803 --> 05:28:14,707
THE UNITED STATES AND MEMBERS 

9495
05:28:14,707 --> 05:28:16,342
OF THE PRESS, THIS HISTORIC 

9496
05:28:16,342 --> 05:28:17,811
MEETING THAT WE ALL SAW 

9497
05:28:17,811 --> 05:28:18,445
UNFOLDING BEFORE OUR EYES HERE, 

9498
05:28:18,445 --> 05:28:19,045
AND YOU SAW FROM THE GROUND 

9499
05:28:19,045 --> 05:28:19,679
THERE IN SINGAPORE, THE FIRST-

9500
05:28:19,679 --> 05:28:22,949
EVER MEETING BETWEEN A SITTING 

9501
05:28:22,949 --> 05:28:23,549
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT AND A 

9502
05:28:23,549 --> 05:28:26,386
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA AND 

9503
05:28:26,386 --> 05:28:26,986
ULTIMATELY COMING AWAY WITH A 

9504
05:28:26,986 --> 05:28:27,587
SIGNED JOINT AGREEMENT, JUST 

9505
05:28:27,587 --> 05:28:28,221
THE HISTORY IN THE MAKING THAT 

9506
05:28:28,221 --> 05:28:29,555
HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE OF THE 

9507
05:28:29,555 --> 05:28:34,227
LAST NINE HOURS OR SO. 

9508
05:28:34,227 --> 05:28:34,494
>> YEAH. 

9509
05:28:34,494 --> 05:28:37,096
I THINK THERE WERE A COUPLE 

9510
05:28:37,096 --> 05:28:37,663
THINGS TO PAY ATTENTION TO. 

9511
05:28:37,663 --> 05:28:40,700
AS FAR AS LAST NIGHT GOES, 

9512
05:28:40,700 --> 05:28:43,236
THERE WAS -- YES, THERE WAS THE 

9513
05:28:43,236 --> 05:28:43,870
THEATER OF WHAT HAPPENED, THERE 

9514
05:28:43,870 --> 05:28:49,876
WAS WHAT WE SAW FROM THESE TWO 

9515
05:28:49,876 --> 05:28:50,476
MEN, THE MULTIPLE HANDSHAKES, 

9516
05:28:50,476 --> 05:28:51,077
THAT RELATIONSHIP -- BECAUSE 

9517
05:28:51,077 --> 05:28:51,711
THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT 

9518
05:28:51,711 --> 05:28:55,148
IT SO MUCH, BECAUSE HE HAS SAID 

9519
05:28:55,148 --> 05:28:56,383
HE FEELS LIKE THAT IS SO 

9520
05:28:56,383 --> 05:28:56,916
IMPORTANT, THAT POTENTIAL 

9521
05:28:56,916 --> 05:28:58,952
CONNECTION AND HOW THAT 

9522
05:28:58,952 --> 05:29:02,289
HAPPENS, ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S 

9523
05:29:02,289 --> 05:29:02,789
THE MEETING LAST NIGHT. 

9524
05:29:02,789 --> 05:29:06,859
AND THEN MORE IMPORTANT IS THE 

9525
05:29:06,859 --> 05:29:07,460
LANGUAGE IN THE FRAMEWORK WE 

9526
05:29:07,460 --> 05:29:07,827
SEE HERE NOW. 

9527
05:29:07,827 --> 05:29:09,930
DOES IT SAY COMPLETE 

9528
05:29:09,930 --> 05:29:10,330
DENUCLEARIZATION? 

9529
05:29:10,330 --> 05:29:10,664
YES, IT DOES. 

9530
05:29:10,664 --> 05:29:16,002
IS THE WORD VERIFIABLE IN 

9531
05:29:16,002 --> 05:29:16,236
THERE? 

9532
05:29:16,236 --> 05:29:16,403
NO. 

9533
05:29:16,403 --> 05:29:18,905
AS FAR AS THE SEQUENCE OF THE 

9534
05:29:18,905 --> 05:29:20,773
POINTS GOES, SOME HAVE NOTED 

9535
05:29:20,773 --> 05:29:25,879
ALREADY THAT NORTH KOREA WOULD 

9536
05:29:25,879 --> 05:29:27,914
HAVE PREFERRED AND GOT THAT. 

9537
05:29:27,914 --> 05:29:30,283
WE TALK ABOUT THESE FIRST TWO 

9538
05:29:30,283 --> 05:29:31,051
POINTS, FIRST TALKING ABOUT A 

9539
05:29:31,051 --> 05:29:32,119
STABLE FUTURE, PEACE, A PEACE 

9540
05:29:32,119 --> 05:29:33,119
REGIME ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, 

9541
05:29:33,119 --> 05:29:35,355
THOSE ARE THE FIRST COUPLE 

9542
05:29:35,355 --> 05:29:36,422
POINTS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND 

9543
05:29:36,422 --> 05:29:38,691
THEN IT MOVES DOWN TO 

9544
05:29:38,691 --> 05:29:39,258
DENUCLEARIZATION, AND THEN 

9545
05:29:39,258 --> 05:29:39,892
THERE'S THE FOURTH POINT WHICH 

9546
05:29:39,892 --> 05:29:42,862
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SO MANY IN 

9547
05:29:42,862 --> 05:29:46,933
THE U.S. AND THAT IS THE RETURN 

9548
05:29:46,933 --> 05:29:47,466
OF THESE POW/MIA REMAINS. 

9549
05:29:47,466 --> 05:29:48,134
THE PRESIDENT INDICATED AT THE 

9550
05:29:48,134 --> 05:29:50,170
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WAS A 

9551
05:29:50,170 --> 05:29:50,770
LAST MINUTE ADDITION, BUT ITS 

9552
05:29:50,770 --> 05:29:54,941
ERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN 

9553
05:29:54,941 --> 05:29:55,574
TALKED ABOUT BETWEEN THESE TWO 

9554
05:29:55,574 --> 05:29:56,309

MEETING, BUT THERE WILL BE 

9579
05:30:31,344 --> 05:30:32,211
QUESTIONS AND THERE WILL BE

FOLLOWUPS, ESPECIALLY TO THE

THE FINISH LINE. 

9588
05:30:44,024 --> 05:30:52,966
>> YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 

9589
05:30:52,966 --> 05:30:54,935
AND THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION 

9590
05:30:54,935 --> 05:30:55,502
WE'VE TALKING FOR THE LAST 

9591
05:30:55,502 --> 05:30:56,336
SEVERAL HOURS NOW SINCE THIS 

9592
05:30:56,336 --> 05:30:56,903
DOCUMENT WAS SIGNED AND WE 

9593
05:30:56,903 --> 05:30:57,970
STARTED LEARNING WHAT WAS IN 

9594
05:30:57,970 --> 05:30:58,137
IT. 

9595
05:30:58,137 --> 05:30:59,071
REALLY, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE ALL 

9596
05:30:59,071 --> 05:30:59,639
THESE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS 

9597
05:30:59,639 --> 05:31:03,276
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS AGREED 

9598
05:31:03,276 --> 05:31:05,111
TO, WHAT WILL HE ACTUALLY 

9599
05:31:05,111 --> 05:31:06,479
IMPLEMENTED, YOU KNOW, THIS 

9600
05:31:06,479 --> 05:31:07,079
VERY LIMITED BROAD AGREEMENT, 

9601
05:31:07,079 --> 05:31:08,315
AND THAT WILL BE UP TO, AS THE 

9602
05:31:08,315 --> 05:31:08,949
PRESIDENT SAID, MIKE POMPEO AND 

9603
05:31:08,949 --> 05:31:09,649
OTHER 

9604
05:31:09,649 --> 05:31:10,951
NEGOTIATORS WILL BEGIN MEETING 

9605
05:31:10,951 --> 05:31:13,820
NEXT WEEK, WHAT WILL THAT 

9606
05:31:13,820 --> 05:31:14,253
PROCESS LOOK LIKE. 

9607
05:31:14,253 --> 05:31:14,787
AND THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 

9608
05:31:14,787 --> 05:31:15,388
HINTED THAT HE WAS LOOKING TO 

9609
05:31:15,388 --> 05:31:16,022
SEE CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA JOIN 

9610
05:31:16,022 --> 05:31:19,859
THESE TALKS IN SOME FORM OR 

9611
05:31:19,859 --> 05:31:20,126
FASHION. 

9612
05:31:20,126 --> 05:31:20,694
WILL OTHERS BE BROUGHT IN? 

9613
05:31:20,694 --> 05:31:22,929
WHAT WILL THE NATURE -- HOW 

9614
05:31:22,929 --> 05:31:23,396
OFTEN WILL THEY MEET? 

9615
05:31:23,396 --> 05:31:24,831
WILL THERE BE CERTAIN 

9616
05:31:24,831 --> 05:31:25,298
TIMETABLES FOR THESE 

9617
05:31:25,298 --> 05:31:25,798
DELIVERABLES TO BE MET? 

9618
05:31:25,798 --> 05:31:30,236
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW ANY OF 

9619
05:31:30,236 --> 05:31:33,139
THAT RIGHT NOW.ACTUALLY, IF 

9620
05:31:33,139 --> 05:31:34,074
ANYTHING, THAT'S WHAT WE WERE 

9621
05:31:34,074 --> 05:31:35,041
LOOKING TO HEAR OUT OF THE 

9622
05:31:35,041 --> 05:31:36,610
SUMMIT, IT WAS A TIMETABLE 

9623
05:31:36,610 --> 05:31:37,177
STRUCTURE FOR SOME OF THOSE 

9624
05:31:37,177 --> 05:31:37,811
TALKS AND THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE 

9625
05:31:37,811 --> 05:31:39,579
OF THOSE THINGS WE HAVEN'T 

9626
05:31:39,579 --> 05:31:40,013
QUITE LEARNED YET. 

9627
05:31:40,013 --> 05:31:43,049
MAYBE WE WILL LEARN THAT WHILE 

9628
05:31:43,049 --> 05:31:47,053
THE PRESIDENT IS FLYING BACK TO 

9629
05:31:47,053 --> 05:31:47,486
THE UNITED STATES. 

9630
05:31:47,486 --> 05:31:48,054
AND THEN ALSO WILL THERE BE 

9631
05:31:48,054 --> 05:31:50,690
CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME OF THESE 

9632
05:31:50,690 --> 05:31:52,659
-- WE TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT 

9633
05:31:52,659 --> 05:31:59,666
CALLING THE QUESTION, THE 

9634
05:31:59,666 --> 05:32:00,300
NATURE OF THESE ALLIANCES WHEN 

9635
05:32:00,300 --> 05:32:07,340
IT COMES TO THE WAR GAMES, HIS 

9636
05:32:07,340 --> 05:32:08,241
CONVERSATION COMING UP WITH 

9637
05:32:08,241 --> 05:32:08,808
PRESIDENT MOON JUST A BIT. 

9638
05:32:08,808 --> 05:32:10,443
WILL THERE BE ALLIANCE FROM THE 

9639
05:32:10,443 --> 05:32:11,077
REGION AND AROUND THE WORLD IN 

9640
05:32:11,077 --> 05:32:11,610
THE WAY THE PRESIDENT HAS 

9641
05:32:11,610 --> 05:32:12,211
CONDUCTED THESE NEGOTIATIONS, 

9642
05:32:12,211 --> 05:32:12,778
THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL BE 

9643
05:32:12,778 --> 05:32:13,412
WATCHING OBVIOUSLY VERY CLOSELY 

9644
05:32:13,412 --> 05:32:14,814
AT OVER THE HOURS AND WEEKS. 

9645
05:32:14,814 --> 05:32:16,549
>> ZEKE, I HOPE YOU CAN STAND 

9646
05:32:16,549 --> 05:32:16,716
BY. 

9647
05:32:16,716 --> 05:32:17,751
ED IS STILL WITH US AS WELL 

9648
05:32:17,751 --> 05:32:18,184
FROM OUR WASHINGTON 

9649
05:32:18,184 --> 05:32:18,818
BUREAU AND ISAAC IS HERE ON THE 

9650
05:32:18,818 --> 05:32:19,152

ED, TO YOU FIRST, AND, ISAAC, 

9652
05:32:19,753 --> 05:32:20,353
I'LL ASK YOU THE SAME THING. 

9653
05:32:20,353 --> 05:32:21,888
THERE WAS ONE MOMENT WHEN THE 

9654
05:32:21,888 --> 05:32:22,522
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

9655
05:32:22,522 --> 05:32:23,256
WAS ASKED BY I THINK A MEMBER 

9656
05:32:23,256 --> 05:32:26,293
OF THE FOREIGN PRESS, I DON'T 

9657
05:32:26,293 --> 05:32:26,826
THINK IT WAS AN AMERICAN 

9658
05:32:26,826 --> 05:32:29,496
REPORTER WHO VERY POINTEDLY 

9659
05:32:29,496 --> 05:32:30,029
ASKED PRESIDENT TRUMP THE 

9660
05:32:30,029 --> 05:32:31,097
QUESTION THAT HAD BEEN ASKED BY 

9661
05:32:31,097 --> 05:32:32,665
ANALYSTS AND PUNDITS LEADING UP 

9662
05:32:32,665 --> 05:32:35,401
TO THIS HISTORIC MEETING WHICH 

9663
05:32:35,401 --> 05:32:38,004
IS BY MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN 

9664
05:32:38,004 --> 05:32:38,404
ARE YOU PROVIDING 

9665
05:32:38,404 --> 05:32:38,938
LEGITIMACY TO HIS REGIME? 

9666
05:32:38,938 --> 05:32:39,472
AND THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 

9667
05:32:39,472 --> 05:32:42,142
REFUSING TO ANSWER THAT 

9668
05:32:42,142 --> 05:32:42,776
QUESTION, MAYBE BECAUSE HE FELT 

9669
05:32:42,776 --> 05:32:43,376
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BECAUSE IT 

9670
05:32:43,376 --> 05:32:44,377
WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE U.S. 

9671
05:32:44,377 --> 05:32:46,679
PRESS, BUT THAT IS SOMETHING 

9672
05:32:46,679 --> 05:32:47,279
THAT IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSED 

9673
05:32:47,279 --> 05:32:51,117
IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD AS 

9674
05:32:51,117 --> 05:32:51,718
WE LOOK AT THE AGREEMENT THAT 

9675
05:32:51,718 --> 05:32:56,389
WAS SIGNED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP 

9676
05:32:56,389 --> 05:32:56,789
AND CHAIRMAN KIM. 

9677
05:32:56,789 --> 05:32:58,959
THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT, 

9678
05:32:58,959 --> 05:32:59,492
FOR EXAMPLE, AT ONE POINT 

9679
05:32:59,492 --> 05:33:03,396
SAYING TO A QUESTION FROM 

9680
05:33:03,396 --> 05:33:03,797
ANOTHER REPORTER 

9681
05:33:03,797 --> 05:33:06,433
SAYING THAT ONE OF THE GREAT 

9682
05:33:06,433 --> 05:33:07,033
WINNERS FROM THIS MEETING ARE 

9683
05:33:07,033 --> 05:33:07,667
THE GROUP OF NORTH KOREANS WHO 

9684
05:33:07,667 --> 05:33:08,434
ARE FORCED TO LABOR IN GULAGS, 

9685
05:33:08,434 --> 05:33:09,035
THE PRESIDENT SAYING THEY ARE 

9686
05:33:09,035 --> 05:33:11,037
ONE OF THE GREAT WINNERS AS A 

9687
05:33:11,037 --> 05:33:11,271
GROUP. 

9688
05:33:11,271 --> 05:33:14,307
I THINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE 

9689
05:33:14,307 --> 05:33:14,940
-- I KNOW THAT WE'RE STILL JUST 

9690
05:33:14,940 --> 05:33:15,608
A COUPLE OF MINUTES OUT OF THIS 

9691
05:33:15,608 --> 05:33:17,310
PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT THERE'S 

9692
05:33:17,310 --> 05:33:18,344
GOING TO BE A PARSING OF HIS 

9693
05:33:18,344 --> 05:33:18,945
WORDS, AND WORDS DO MATTER 

9694
05:33:18,945 --> 05:33:24,016
BECAUSE HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF 

9695
05:33:24,016 --> 05:33:24,450
THE UNITED STATES. 

9696
05:33:24,450 --> 05:33:26,386
>> YEAH. 

9697
05:33:26,386 --> 05:33:27,120
AND I THINK PREVIOUS 

9698
05:33:27,120 --> 05:33:27,754
ADMINISTRATIONS MIGHT HAVE PUT 

9699
05:33:27,754 --> 05:33:30,623
MORE EMPHASIS ON THAT QUESTION 

9700
05:33:30,623 --> 05:33:31,223
AND VERIFYING THAT THINGS ARE 

9701
05:33:31,223 --> 05:33:35,628
IMPROVING WHEN IT COMES TO 

9702
05:33:35,628 --> 05:33:36,129
HUMAN RIGHTS ALONGSIDE 

9703
05:33:36,129 --> 05:33:36,529
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

9704
05:33:36,529 --> 05:33:38,364
YOU KNOW, HE ALSO SUGGESTED AT 

9705
05:33:38,364 --> 05:33:42,669
ONE POINT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS DID 

9706
05:33:42,669 --> 05:33:42,936
COME UP. 

9707
05:33:42,936 --> 05:33:43,469
REMEMBER GOING INTO THIS 

9708
05:33:43,469 --> 05:33:45,204
MEETING WE WERE TOLD BY I 

9709
05:33:45,204 --> 05:33:46,773
BELIEVE SECRETARY POMPEO AND 

9710
05:33:46,773 --> 05:33:47,340
OTHER SENIOR ADMINISTRATION 

9711
05:33:47,340 --> 05:33:49,442
OFFICIALS THAT HUMAN RIGHTS 

9712
05:33:49,442 --> 05:33:50,009
WOULD NOT BE ON THE AGENDA. 

9713
05:33:50,009 --> 05:33:51,810
THEY MAY HAVE JUST SAID THAT 

9714
05:33:51,810 --> 05:33:53,580
PUBLICLY SO AS TO KEEP THE 

9715
05:33:53,580 --> 05:33:54,213
NORTH KOREANS FROM BACKING OUT 

9716
05:33:54,213 --> 05:33:54,847
AT THE LAST MINUTE AND MAYBE IT 

9717
05:33:54,847 --> 05:33:55,448
CAME UP IN THE MEETING, MAYBE 

9718
05:33:55,448 --> 05:33:59,118
IT DIDN'T COME UP IN THE 

9719
05:33:59,118 --> 05:33:59,385
MEETING. 

9720
05:33:59,385 --> 05:34:02,388
AND UNTIL WE GET SOME KIND OF 

9721
05:34:02,388 --> 05:34:02,988
VERIFICATION OF THAT, I THINK 

9722
05:34:02,988 --> 05:34:03,622
IT'S PROPER TO PERHAPS BE A BIT 

9723
05:34:03,622 --> 05:34:04,256
SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S 

9724
05:34:04,256 --> 05:34:10,263
STATEMENT THERE THAT IT DID 

9725
05:34:10,263 --> 05:34:10,830
INDEED GET DISCUSSED. 

9726
05:34:10,830 --> 05:34:11,965
BHU, YES, IT WILL DEFINITELY -- 

9727
05:34:11,965 --> 05:34:15,401
BUT, YES, IT WILL DEFINITELY BE 

9728
05:34:15,401 --> 05:34:18,037
A MAIN TOPIC OF CONCERN AMONG 

9729
05:34:18,037 --> 05:34:19,305
THE PRESIDENT'S TOP CRITICS, 

9730
05:34:19,305 --> 05:34:19,872
NOT ONLY IN SORT OF FOREIGN 

9731
05:34:19,872 --> 05:34:20,439
POLICY OF THE WORLD, BUT I 

9732
05:34:20,439 --> 05:34:21,040
WOULD THINK ON CAPITOL HILL 

9733
05:34:21,040 --> 05:34:23,108
LATER TODAY THERE WILL START TO 

9734
05:34:23,108 --> 05:34:23,743
BE SOME CONCERN THAT, HEY, 

9735
05:34:23,743 --> 05:34:25,644
MAYBE WE'RE GOING DOWN THE PATH 

9736
05:34:25,644 --> 05:34:26,245
TOO QUICKLY WITH THEM ON THIS 

9737
05:34:26,245 --> 05:34:28,348
AND NOT ALSO DISCUSSING THE 

9738
05:34:28,348 --> 05:34:31,384
FACT THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 

9739
05:34:31,384 --> 05:34:32,018
OF NORTH KOREANS ARE IN FORCED 

9740
05:34:32,018 --> 05:34:32,551
LABOR CAMPS, THAT OTHERS 

9741
05:34:32,551 --> 05:34:38,391
HAVE BEEN KILLED WITH NO 

9742
05:34:38,391 --> 05:34:38,924
APPARENT REASON AND QUITE 

9743
05:34:38,924 --> 05:34:39,558
GRUESOMELY, AND THAT, YOU KNOW, 

9744
05:34:39,558 --> 05:34:40,026
THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO 

9745
05:34:40,026 --> 05:34:42,428
CLEARLY HAS A TOTAL GRIP ON HIS 

9746
05:34:42,428 --> 05:34:42,928
COUNTRY AND NO SENSE OF 

9747
05:34:42,928 --> 05:34:43,228
DEMOCRACY. 

9748
05:34:43,228 --> 05:34:46,933
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS ALSO 

9749
05:34:46,933 --> 05:34:47,566
ASKED AT ONE POINT DO YOU HAVE 

9750
05:34:47,566 --> 05:34:49,635
A MODEL FOR WHAT A FUTURE NORTH 

9751
05:34:49,635 --> 05:34:50,436
KOREA MIGHT LOOK LIKE, AND HE 

9752
05:34:50,436 --> 05:34:53,873
SAID, WELL, THAT'LL BE UP TO 

9753
05:34:53,873 --> 05:34:54,040
THE 

9754
05:34:54,040 --> 05:34:58,945
NORTH KOREANS TO DECIDE WHICH 

9755
05:34:58,945 --> 05:35:02,448
IS A DEFT DIPLOMATIC STATEMENT 

9756
05:35:02,448 --> 05:35:06,352
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE 

9757
05:35:06,352 --> 05:35:06,986
DICTATING WHAT ANOTHER COUNTRY 

9758
05:35:06,986 --> 05:35:07,387
DOES NECESSARILY. 

9759
05:35:07,387 --> 05:35:08,388
BUT, AGAIN, I THINK SOME OF HIS 

9760
05:35:08,388 --> 05:35:08,988
PREDECESSORS MIGHT HAVE SAID 

9761
05:35:08,988 --> 05:35:11,057
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF, 

9762
05:35:11,057 --> 05:35:11,924
BUT WE WOULD HOPE THAT THEY'LL 

9763
05:35:11,924 --> 05:35:13,326
ADOPT SOME SENSE OR SOME 

9764
05:35:13,326 --> 05:35:14,394
DEMOCRATIC NORMS AND BECOME A 

9765
05:35:14,394 --> 05:35:15,028
FREER SOCIETY. 

9766
05:35:15,028 --> 05:35:16,729
SO PERHAPS AN OPPORTUNITY 

9767
05:35:16,729 --> 05:35:17,063
MISSED THERE. 

9768
05:35:17,063 --> 05:35:17,630
BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS 

9769
05:35:17,630 --> 05:35:18,231
BEEN PRETTY LASER FOCUSED ON 

9770
05:35:18,231 --> 05:35:19,098
THE IDEA OF DENUCLEARIZATION 

9771
05:35:19,098 --> 05:35:19,632
FIRST AND EVERYTHING ELSE 

9772
05:35:19,632 --> 05:35:19,866
LATER. 

9773
05:35:19,866 --> 05:35:20,266
>> ED, STAND BY. 

9774
05:35:20,266 --> 05:35:26,272
I WANT TO BRING INDUYNG KIM, 

9775
05:35:26,272 --> 05:35:27,040
SHE'S AT THE PENINSULA

9776
05:35:27,040 --> 05:35:30,543
-- I WANT TO BRING IN DEYEON 

9777
05:35:30,543 --> 05:35:35,048
KIM, SHE'S A SENIOR FELLOW AT 

9778
05:35:35,048 --> 05:35:37,517
THE PENINSULA OF FUTURE FORUM, 

9779
05:35:37,517 --> 05:35:37,984
SHE IS IN SINGAPORE. 

9780
05:35:37,984 --> 05:35:38,618
YOU WATCHED THESE EVENTS UNFOLD 

9781
05:35:38,618 --> 05:35:39,252
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS 

9782
05:35:39,252 --> 05:35:39,819
CULMINATING IN THAT PRESS 

9783
05:35:39,819 --> 05:35:41,554
CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT 

9784
05:35:41,554 --> 05:35:42,021
OF THE UNITED STATES. 

9785
05:35:42,021 --> 05:35:42,655
I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THE 

9786
05:35:42,655 --> 05:35:43,289
HISTORIC MEETING AND THEN SOME 

9787
05:35:43,289 --> 05:35:43,956
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT PRESIDENT 

9788
05:35:43,956 --> 05:35:44,490
TRUMP ANSWERED, WHAT YOU 

9789
05:35:44,490 --> 05:35:51,664
THOUGHT OF HIS RESPONSES TO 

9790
05:35:51,664 --> 05:35:54,233
REPORTERS' QUESTIONS.GLP 

9791
05:35:54,233 --> 05:35:54,567
THANKS, VLAD. 

9792
05:35:54,567 --> 05:35:55,201
WELL, ON THE SUMMIT ITSELF, THE 

9793
05:35:55,201 --> 05:35:55,801
MEETING ITSELF, THE THEATRICS 

9794
05:35:55,801 --> 05:35:59,005
WERE THERE, THE ATMOSPHERE WAS 

9795
05:35:59,005 --> 05:35:59,572
THERE, AT LEAST THE PUBLIC 

9796
05:35:59,572 --> 05:36:02,408
VIDEO CLIPS THAT WE'VE SEEN OF 

9797
05:36:02,408 --> 05:36:03,009
THEM, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 

9798
05:36:03,009 --> 05:36:06,045
DISCUSSION WAS LIKE IN PRVATE, 

9799
05:36:06,045 --> 05:36:06,645
BUT ON THE SUBSTANTIVE LEVEL, 

9800
05:36:06,645 --> 05:36:08,614
THE JOINT STATEMENT AND THE 

9801
05:36:08,614 --> 05:36:10,750
ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS DURING 

9802
05:36:10,750 --> 05:36:11,317
THE PRESS CONFERENCE, THEY 

9803
05:36:11,317 --> 05:36:14,387
LEAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS THAN 

9804
05:36:14,387 --> 05:36:14,654
ANSWERS. 

9805
05:36:14,654 --> 05:36:18,691
DID THEY AGREE ON WHAT 

9806
05:36:18,691 --> 05:36:19,191
DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS? 

9807
05:36:19,191 --> 05:36:19,825
DID THEY AGREE ON A TIMETABLE? 

9808
05:36:19,825 --> 05:36:22,228
IT SOUNDS LIKE BASED ON THE 

9809
05:36:22,228 --> 05:36:22,828
JOINT STATEMENT THEY DID NOT, 

9810
05:36:22,828 --> 05:36:23,329
AND PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT 

9811
05:36:23,329 --> 05:36:26,765
SECRETARY POMPEO IS GOING TO 

9812
05:36:26,765 --> 05:36:27,266
HAVE TO NEGOTIATE GOING 

9813
05:36:27,266 --> 05:36:27,533
FORWARD. 

9814
05:36:27,533 --> 05:36:29,568
ONE KEY ISSUE THAT STOOD OUT 

9815
05:36:29,568 --> 05:36:30,069
FOR ME DURING THE PRESS 

9816
05:36:30,069 --> 05:36:32,438
CONFERENCE WAS THE MENTIONING 

9817
05:36:32,438 --> 05:36:35,708
OF U.S. TROOPS ON THE KOREAN 

9818
05:36:35,708 --> 05:36:38,377
PENINSULA AND THE JOINT 

9819
05:36:38,377 --> 05:36:38,878
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH 

9820
05:36:38,878 --> 05:36:39,479
AMERICAN ALLIES, SOUTH KOREA. 

9821
05:36:39,479 --> 05:36:40,212
NOW, HE FIRST ANSWERED THE 

9822
05:36:40,212 --> 05:36:40,813
QUESTION AS SAYING, NO, WE'RE 

9823
05:36:40,813 --> 05:36:44,216
NOT REDUCING TROOPS ON THE 

9824
05:36:44,216 --> 05:36:44,750
KOREAN PENINSULA WHICH IS 

9825
05:36:44,750 --> 05:36:49,289
REASSURING TO BOTH SOUTH KOREA 

9826
05:36:49,289 --> 05:36:50,390
AND JAPANESE ALLIES, BUT THEN 

9827
05:36:50,390 --> 05:36:55,061
HE SAID HE WANTS TO WITHDRAW 

9828
05:36:55,061 --> 05:36:55,995
ALL HIS TROOPS AT SOME POINT, 

9829
05:36:55,995 --> 05:36:56,695
AND THAT IS A BIG MISTAKE. 

9830
05:36:56,695 --> 05:36:59,032
THE TROOPS ARE THERE TO 

9831
05:36:59,032 --> 05:36:59,699
MAINTAIN STABILITY AND SECURITY 

9832
05:36:59,699 --> 05:37:00,066
IN THE REGION. 

9833
05:37:00,066 --> 05:37:03,036
IT'S NOT JUST IN SOUTH KOREA, 

9834
05:37:03,036 --> 05:37:03,603
IT'S THE REGION AS A WHOLE. 

9835
05:37:03,603 --> 05:37:06,873
HE IS WRONG WHEN HE SAYS THAT 

9836
05:37:06,873 --> 05:37:07,373
IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO 

9837
05:37:07,373 --> 05:37:07,840
KEEP TROOPS THERE. 

9838
05:37:07,840 --> 05:37:14,347
IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO 

9839
05:37:14,347 --> 05:37:14,948
BRING THEM HOME. 

9840
05:37:14,948 --> 05:37:16,082
THE OTHER ISSUE I HAD WAS HE 

9841
05:37:16,082 --> 05:37:16,516
ANSWERED A QUESTION 

9842
05:37:16,516 --> 05:37:18,351
SAYING THAT THE WAR GAMES -- HE 

9843
05:37:18,351 --> 05:37:18,951
CALLS THEM WAR GAMES WILL BE 

9844
05:37:18,951 --> 05:37:20,819
DISCONTINUED, WILL BE CANCELED, 

9845
05:37:20,819 --> 05:37:22,956
AND THAT CONCERNS ME. 

9846
05:37:22,956 --> 05:37:24,023
DID HE MEAN THE JOINT MILITARY 

9847
05:37:24,023 --> 05:37:26,292
EXERCISES, THE DEFENSIVE 

9848
05:37:26,292 --> 05:37:27,927
DRILLS, OR DID HE MEAN THE 

9849
05:37:27,927 --> 05:37:28,460
BOMBERS AND THE STRATEGIC 

9850
05:37:28,460 --> 05:37:30,897
ASSETS THAT ARE MORE 

9851
05:37:30,897 --> 05:37:31,464
PROVOCATIVE IN THE DRILLS? 

9852
05:37:31,464 --> 05:37:34,901
IF IT'S THE FORMER, IF IT'S THE 

9853
05:37:34,901 --> 05:37:35,535
ENTIRE EXERCISES, THIS IS ALSO 

9854
05:37:35,535 --> 05:37:35,902
A BIG MISTAKE. 

9855
05:37:35,902 --> 05:37:37,003
THESE ARE DEFENSIVE IN NATURE, 

9856
05:37:37,003 --> 05:37:38,371
THE NORTH KOREANS KNOW THEY 

9857
05:37:38,371 --> 05:37:40,139
ARE, THEY KNOW WHEN THEY 

9858
05:37:40,139 --> 05:37:40,506
HAPPEN, AND IT 

9859
05:37:40,506 --> 05:37:43,042
REALLY IS -- IT'S JUST LIKE 

9860
05:37:43,042 --> 05:37:43,609
DROPPING YOUR SHIELD, YOUR 

9861
05:37:43,609 --> 05:37:47,046
DEFENSIVE SHIELD IN FRONT OF A 

9862
05:37:47,046 --> 05:37:47,613
DRAWN SWORD AND THAT DRAWN 

9863
05:37:47,613 --> 05:37:48,247
SWORD IS NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR 

9864
05:37:48,247 --> 05:37:48,514
WEAPONS. 

9865
05:37:48,514 --> 05:37:50,383
UNTIL NORTH KOREA GETS RID OF 

9866
05:37:50,383 --> 05:37:53,820
THE NUKE WEAPONS, THESE 

9867
05:37:53,820 --> 05:37:54,420
MILITARY EXERCISES SHOULD NOT 

9868
05:37:54,420 --> 05:37:54,754
BE STOPPED. 

9869
05:37:54,754 --> 05:37:57,790
>> DUYEON KIM JOINING US FROM 

9870
05:37:57,790 --> 05:37:58,090
SINGAPORE. 

9871
05:37:58,090 --> 05:37:59,324
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

WE APPRECIATE IT.

05:38:06,899 --> 05:38:09,702
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU. 

9875
05:38:09,702 --> 05:38:11,336

AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MARGARET

BRENNAN IS JOINING ME NOW HERE 

9879
05:38:14,574 --> 05:38:14,907
AT THE TABLE. 

9880
05:38:14,907 --> 05:38:16,275
MARGARET, A REMARKABLE SERIES 

9881
05:38:16,275 --> 05:38:16,708
OF EVENTS UNFOLDING 

9882
05:38:16,708 --> 05:38:17,443
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS 

9883
05:38:17,443 --> 05:38:17,976
CULMINATING IN THAT PRESS 

9884
05:38:17,976 --> 05:38:18,577
CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT 

9885
05:38:18,577 --> 05:38:23,282
OF THE UNITED STATES, AND WHAT 

9886
05:38:23,282 --> 05:38:24,784
MANY PEOPLE ARE CALLING 

9887
05:38:24,784 --> 05:38:25,117
CONCESSIONS. 

9888
05:38:25,117 --> 05:38:26,285
LET'S FACE IT, WHAT THE 

9889
05:38:26,285 --> 05:38:26,919
PRESIDENT SAID, WHAT DUYEON KIM 

9890
05:38:26,919 --> 05:38:29,589
JUST SAID, REMOVING TROOPS AT 

9891
05:38:29,589 --> 05:38:30,156
SOME POINT FROM THE KOREAN 

9892
05:38:30,156 --> 05:38:31,023
PENINSULA, STOPPING THE WAR 

9893
05:38:31,023 --> 05:38:31,657
GAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN DEFENSIVE 

9894
05:38:31,657 --> 05:38:32,224
IN NATURE, THEREFORE TO THE 

9895
05:38:32,224 --> 05:38:33,593
BENEFIT OF SOUTH KOREA, WHAT 

9896
05:38:33,593 --> 05:38:35,461
DID YOU MAKE OF THOSE RESPONSE? 

9897
05:38:35,461 --> 05:38:36,095
>> WELL, IT WILL BE INTERESTING 

9898
05:38:36,095 --> 05:38:38,164
TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY 

9899
05:38:38,164 --> 05:38:38,698
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE 

9900
05:38:38,698 --> 05:38:39,499
AGREEMENT THAT WAS SIGNED THAT 

9901
05:38:39,499 --> 05:38:41,533
IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STATEMENT 

9902
05:38:41,533 --> 05:38:42,134
THAT WAS RELEASED BECAUSE THE 

9903
05:38:42,134 --> 05:38:42,701
STATEMENT THAT WE'VE GOTTEN 

9904
05:38:42,701 --> 05:38:47,006
THAT THE PRESS SECRETARY HANDED 

9905
05:38:47,006 --> 05:38:47,573
TO US WAS ALL VERY GENERAL. 

9906
05:38:47,573 --> 05:38:50,276
IT WAS A PLEDGE OF FUTURE 

9907
05:38:50,276 --> 05:38:50,909
ACTION, IT WAS A DESCRIPTION OF 

9908
05:38:50,909 --> 05:38:51,543
WHERE THEY WANT TO GO, A ROAD 

9909
05:38:51,543 --> 05:38:53,146
MAP, A FRAMEWORK, ALL OF THAT 

9910
05:38:53,146 --> 05:38:53,646
CAN BE PULLED BACK VERY 

9911
05:38:53,646 --> 05:38:53,913
QUICKLY. 

9912
05:38:53,913 --> 05:38:55,080
BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS, LOOK, 

9913
05:38:55,080 --> 05:38:57,250
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNITY 

9914
05:38:57,250 --> 05:38:57,884
BELIEVES REGARDLESS OF POLITICS 

9915
05:38:57,884 --> 05:38:58,650
THIS IS THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE 

9916
05:38:58,650 --> 05:39:03,355
IN TERMS OF THE THREAT TO U.S. 

9917
05:39:03,355 --> 05:39:03,655
TERRITORY. 

9918
05:39:03,655 --> 05:39:07,059
PRESIDENT OBAMA BEFORE THE 

9919
05:39:07,059 --> 05:39:07,693
PRESIDENT WAS INAUGURATED SAID 

9920
05:39:07,693 --> 05:39:08,727
THIS WILL BE YOUR NUMBER ONE 

9921
05:39:08,727 --> 05:39:09,028
CHALLENGE. 

9922
05:39:09,028 --> 05:39:09,896
SO GIVING THE PRESIDENT HIS DUE 

9923
05:39:09,896 --> 05:39:13,365
THAT HE GOT TO THIS POINT TO 

9924
05:39:13,365 --> 05:39:13,832
EVEN BEGIN TO ENGAGE 

9925
05:39:13,832 --> 05:39:14,333
DIPLOMATICALLY WHEN HIS 

9926
05:39:14,333 --> 05:39:18,971
PREFERRED OPTION AT FIRST 

9927
05:39:18,971 --> 05:39:19,571
GLANCE HAD BEEN MILITARILY IS 

9928
05:39:19,571 --> 05:39:20,138
SOMETHING, BUT IT IS REALLY 

9929
05:39:20,138 --> 05:39:21,808
GOING TO BE IN THE DETAILS IN 

9930
05:39:21,808 --> 05:39:23,442
TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY 

9931
05:39:23,442 --> 05:39:24,911
NEGOTIATE AT THAT MEETING NEXT 

9932
05:39:24,911 --> 05:39:25,278
WEEK, THAT JOHN 

9933
05:39:25,278 --> 05:39:25,878
BOLTON, THE NATIONAL SECURITY 

9934
05:39:25,878 --> 05:39:26,512
ADVISER, THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

9935
05:39:26,512 --> 05:39:28,948
WILL HAVE WITH THE NORTH 

9936
05:39:28,948 --> 05:39:31,383
KOREANS AND IN THE FUTURE. 

9937
05:39:31,383 --> 05:39:32,285
I MEAN, THIS IS THE BEGINNING 

9938
05:39:32,285 --> 05:39:32,618
OF A PROCESS. 

9939
05:39:32,618 --> 05:39:35,020
IT TOOK ABOUT TWO YEARS OF 

9940
05:39:35,020 --> 05:39:37,056
NEGOTIATING WITH IRAN TO GET 

9941
05:39:37,056 --> 05:39:38,557
THE AGREEMENT THAT THE 

9942
05:39:38,557 --> 05:39:40,626
PRESIDENT HAS DESCRIBED AS 

9943
05:39:40,626 --> 05:39:41,127
IMPERFECT AND TORE UP. 

9944
05:39:41,127 --> 05:39:41,727
THAT WAS TWO YEARS WITH A 

9945
05:39:41,727 --> 05:39:42,328
COUNTRY THAT DID NOT HAVE THE 

9946
05:39:42,328 --> 05:39:50,269
TYPE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM 

9947
05:39:50,269 --> 05:39:52,505
THAT NORTH KOREA HAS. 

9948
05:39:52,505 --> 05:39:55,140
SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 

9949
05:39:55,140 --> 05:39:55,707
SOMETHING THAT POTENTIALLY 

9950
05:39:55,707 --> 05:39:57,075
GOES BEYOND THE, YOU KNOW, 

9951
05:39:57,075 --> 05:39:59,045
FIRST TERM OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, 

9952
05:39:59,045 --> 05:40:00,179
IF IT WORKS MAY NOT SEE FULL 

9953
05:40:00,179 --> 05:40:00,780
DISMANTLEMENT INTO THE SECOND 

9954
05:40:00,780 --> 05:40:02,415
TERM, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT 

9955
05:40:02,415 --> 05:40:04,484
BEHIND THE SCENES THEY'VE BEEN 

9956
05:40:04,484 --> 05:40:07,052
WORKING VERY QUICKLY TO TRY TO 

9957
05:40:07,052 --> 05:40:07,686
GET OUR PARTNERS, OTHER NUCLEAR 

9958
05:40:07,686 --> 05:40:08,286
POWERS TO CHIP IN, TO FIGURE 

9959
05:40:08,286 --> 05:40:08,920
OUT HOW THEY CAN POOL RESOURCES 

9960
05:40:08,920 --> 05:40:11,057
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN MORE 

9961
05:40:11,057 --> 05:40:11,557
QUICKLY THAN ESTIMATES. 

9962
05:40:11,557 --> 05:40:12,391
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY IT 

9963
05:40:12,391 --> 05:40:12,858
WON'T TAKE 15 YEARS. 

9964
05:40:12,858 --> 05:40:14,393
THEY WANT IT TO HAPPEN IN A 

9965
05:40:14,393 --> 05:40:14,993
SHORTER DURATION OF TIME, BUT 

9966
05:40:14,993 --> 05:40:18,898
TO ACTUALLY DISMANTLE NUKES, 

9967
05:40:18,898 --> 05:40:19,431
NONE OF THAT WAS PROMISED 

9968
05:40:19,431 --> 05:40:19,665
TODAY. 

9969
05:40:19,665 --> 05:40:20,366
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

9970
05:40:20,366 --> 05:40:20,966
CRITICAL, AS YOU KNOW, OF THE 

9971
05:40:20,966 --> 05:40:23,035
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND THERE WAS 

9972
05:40:23,035 --> 05:40:25,004
A QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED OF 

9973
05:40:25,004 --> 05:40:26,572
THE PRESIDENT, LOOK, IF YOU 

9974
05:40:26,572 --> 05:40:29,108
DON'T GET AT LEAST WHAT 

9975
05:40:29,108 --> 05:40:34,046
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ABLE TO GET 

9976
05:40:34,046 --> 05:40:34,613
WITH IRAN, THAT WAS DAVIDS 

9977
05:40:34,613 --> 05:40:38,618
SANGER, I BELIEVE, OF THE "NEW 

9978
05:40:38,618 --> 05:40:40,586
YORK TIMES," THAT'S A FAILURE. 

9979
05:40:40,586 --> 05:40:40,853
>> RIGHT. 

9980
05:40:40,853 --> 05:40:41,253
>> DO YOU AGREE? 

9981
05:40:41,253 --> 05:40:45,591
>> WELL, DAVID AND I SPENT A 

9982
05:40:45,591 --> 05:40:46,959
LOT OF TIME IN VIENNA COVERING 

9983
05:40:46,959 --> 05:40:47,926
THESE NUCLEAR TALKS WITH IRAN, 

9984
05:40:47,926 --> 05:40:48,894
YES, THAT THE BENCHMARK THE 

9985
05:40:48,894 --> 05:40:50,196
PRESIDENT HAS SET FOR HIMSELF 

9986
05:40:50,196 --> 05:40:50,763
AND HIS SECRETARY OF STATE. 

9987
05:40:50,763 --> 05:40:51,697
REMEMBER, MIKE POMPEO BEFORE HE 

9988
05:40:51,697 --> 05:40:53,065
WAS SECRETARY OF STATE WAS A 

9989
05:40:53,065 --> 05:40:53,633
CONGRESSMAN FROM KANSAS WHO 

9990
05:40:53,633 --> 05:40:55,001
RAISED HOLY HELL ABOUT THE IRAN 

9991
05:40:55,001 --> 05:40:55,568
NUCLEAR DEAL. 

9992
05:40:55,568 --> 05:40:56,669
HE TRIED TO STOP IT. 

9993
05:40:56,669 --> 05:40:59,071
AND SO HE'S GOT -- HE'S SET FOR 

9994
05:40:59,071 --> 05:40:59,672
HIMSELF A CHALLENGING SET OF 

9995
05:40:59,672 --> 05:41:00,106
CIRCUMSTANCES HERE. 

9996
05:41:00,106 --> 05:41:01,941
LOOK, THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, 

9997
05:41:01,941 --> 05:41:02,374
WHAT DID THEY GET? 

9998
05:41:02,374 --> 05:41:07,179
THEY GOT IRAN TO SHIP OUT 97% 

9999
05:41:07,179 --> 05:41:09,048
OF THEIR ENRICHED URANIUM. 

10000
05:41:09,048 --> 05:41:10,482
THEY GOT THEM TO DESTROY 

10001
05:41:10,482 --> 05:41:11,016
THOUSANDS OF CENTRIFUGES. 

10002
05:41:11,016 --> 05:41:13,419
THEY GOT THEM TO FREEZE A 

10003
05:41:13,419 --> 05:41:14,387
PROGRAM NO WHERE NEAR NORTH 

10004
05:41:14,387 --> 05:41:14,687
KOREA'S IS. 

10005
05:41:14,687 --> 05:41:15,254
WHAT THEY DIDN'T GET, THEY 

10006
05:41:15,254 --> 05:41:17,356
DIDN'T GET A HALT TO 

10007
05:41:17,356 --> 05:41:17,923
BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTING. 

10008
05:41:17,923 --> 05:41:18,457
REMEMBER ONE OF PRESIDENT 

10009
05:41:18,457 --> 05:41:19,057
TRUMP'S COMPLAINTS  ABOUT THIS

10010
05:41:19,057 --> 05:41:19,725
DEAL THAT THEY COULD STILL FIRE 

10011
05:41:19,725 --> 05:41:20,393
OFF MISSILES. 

10012
05:41:20,393 --> 05:41:20,860
THEY DIDN'T GET THAT. 

10013
05:41:20,860 --> 05:41:21,394
NOW THE PRESIDENT HAS SET 

10014
05:41:21,394 --> 05:41:23,062
MISSILES ON HIS AGENDA FOR 

10015
05:41:23,062 --> 05:41:23,396
NORTH KOREA. 

10016
05:41:23,396 --> 05:41:26,365
THEY DIDN'T GET ACCESS TO ALL 

10017
05:41:26,365 --> 05:41:26,732
MILITARY BASES. 

10018
05:41:26,732 --> 05:41:31,003
THEY DID GET SNAP INSPECTIONS 

10019
05:41:31,003 --> 05:41:32,204
IN IRAN. 

10020
05:41:32,204 --> 05:41:32,771
THAT WAS ANOTHER COMPLAINT 

10021
05:41:32,771 --> 05:41:38,010
PRESIDENT TRUMP SENT. 

10022
05:41:38,010 --> 05:41:39,178
THAT MEANS IN NORTH KOREA HE'S 

10023
05:41:39,178 --> 05:41:39,812
GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET KIM JONG-

10024
05:41:39,812 --> 05:41:43,148
UN TO SAY HAVE AT IT, LET YOUR 

10025
05:41:43,148 --> 05:41:43,716
INSPECTORS WANDER AROUND MY 

10026
05:41:43,716 --> 05:41:44,383
COUNTRY, INCLUDING INTO SOME OF 

10027
05:41:44,383 --> 05:41:45,017
THE MOST SECRET MILITARY BASES 

10028
05:41:45,017 --> 05:41:46,351
TO SEE IF I HAVE A NUCLEAR 

10029
05:41:46,351 --> 05:41:47,053
PROGRAM. 

10030
05:41:47,053 --> 05:41:47,653
THAT WASN'T AGREED TO TODAY. 

10031
05:41:47,653 --> 05:41:48,654
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE 

10032
05:41:48,654 --> 05:41:50,389
TO COME IN THE FUTURE. 

10033
05:41:50,389 --> 05:41:50,789
THAT TAKES TIME. 

10034
05:41:50,789 --> 05:41:52,625
THAT TAKES TRUST TO BE ABLE TO 

10035
05:41:52,625 --> 05:41:52,825
GET. 

10036
05:41:52,825 --> 05:41:53,459
AND IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO 

10037
05:41:53,459 --> 05:41:53,926
GET THERE WITH IRAN. 

10038
05:41:53,926 --> 05:41:55,427
WE WILL SEE WHERE THEY GO WITH 

10039
05:41:55,427 --> 05:41:55,761
NORTH KOREA. 

10040
05:41:55,761 --> 05:41:58,931
BUT THIS IS A STARTING POINT, 

10041
05:41:58,931 --> 05:42:01,233
AND, YOU KNOW, FOR SOMETHING 

10042
05:42:01,233 --> 05:42:01,701
THAT -- EVERYTHING IS 

10043
05:42:01,701 --> 05:42:02,368
POLITICIZED THESE DAYS, IF THEY 

10044
05:42:02,368 --> 05:42:03,935
CAN MAKE THIS WORK, IT WILL BE 

10045
05:42:03,935 --> 05:42:04,503
A WIN FOR THE WORLD, AT THE 

10046
05:42:04,503 --> 05:42:04,870
PRESIDENT SAID. 

10047
05:42:04,870 --> 05:42:07,773
IT'S A WORLD PROBLEM, HE'S NOT 

10048
05:42:07,773 --> 05:42:08,407
WRONG ON THAT. 

10049
05:42:08,407 --> 05:42:09,108
>> FOR SURE. 

10050
05:42:09,108 --> 05:42:12,812
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE 

10051
05:42:12,812 --> 05:42:13,379
WONDERED HOW WE GOT TO THIS 

10052
05:42:13,379 --> 05:42:14,446
POINT, HOW WE GOT TO THE POINT 

10053
05:42:14,446 --> 05:42:14,914
WHERE A SITTING U.S. 

10054
05:42:14,914 --> 05:42:15,848
PRESIDENT WOULD MEET WITH A 

10055
05:42:15,848 --> 05:42:16,348
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR. 

10056
05:42:16,348 --> 05:42:19,418
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF 

10057
05:42:19,418 --> 05:42:20,920
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID ABOUT 

10058
05:42:20,920 --> 05:42:26,658
WHY HE CHOSE TO MAKE THIS AN 

10059
05:42:26,658 --> 05:42:27,359
IMPERATIVE LET'S PLAY THAT. 

10060
05:42:27,359 --> 05:42:30,930
>> FOR A LONG TIME IN MY LIFE, 

10061
05:42:30,930 --> 05:42:33,699
HIS PARENTS ARE GOOD 

10062
05:42:33,699 --> 05:42:34,099
FRIENDS OF MINE. 

10063
05:42:34,099 --> 05:42:35,134
I THINK WITHOUT OTTO THIS WOULD 

10064
05:42:35,134 --> 05:42:37,469
NOT HAVE HAPPENED. 

10065
05:42:37,469 --> 05:42:38,070
SOMETHING HAPPENED FROM THAT 

10066
05:42:38,070 --> 05:42:38,270
DAY. 

10067
05:42:38,270 --> 05:42:40,138
IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING, IT WAS 

10068
05:42:40,138 --> 05:42:41,507
BRUTAL, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE 

10069
05:42:41,507 --> 05:42:46,211
STARTED TO FOCUS ON WHAT WAS 

10070
05:42:46,211 --> 05:42:47,713
GOING ON, INCLUDING NORTH KOREA.

10071
05:42:48,481 --> 05:42:49,048
I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 

10072
05:42:49,048 --> 05:42:55,054
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN 

10073
05:42:55,054 --> 05:42:55,254
VAIN. 

10074
05:42:55,254 --> 05:42:56,389
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS, 

10075
05:42:56,389 --> 05:42:56,822
SPECIAL YOUNG MAN. 

10076
05:42:56,822 --> 05:42:59,058
AND I HAVE TO SAY SPECIAL 

10077
05:42:59,058 --> 05:43:02,395
PARENTS, SPECIAL PEOPLE. 

10078
05:43:02,395 --> 05:43:02,928
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN. 

10079
05:43:02,928 --> 05:43:05,030
>> AND THE PRESIDENT THERE, 

10080
05:43:05,030 --> 05:43:06,933
MARGARET, SAYING THAT THIS ALL 

10081
05:43:06,933 --> 05:43:10,937
SORT OF BEGAN WITH OTTO, AT 

10082
05:43:10,937 --> 05:43:14,907
LEAST AS FAR AS WHERE WE ARE 

10083
05:43:14,907 --> 05:43:15,173
TODAY. 

10084
05:43:15,173 --> 05:43:16,241
AND WE TALKED ABOUT ALL 

10085
05:43:16,241 --> 05:43:17,877
THROUGHOUT THIS COVERAGE THAT 

10086
05:43:17,877 --> 05:43:18,444
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A CHANGE 

10087
05:43:18,444 --> 05:43:19,478
AGENT, HE'S A DISRUPTER, THAT'S 

10088
05:43:19,478 --> 05:43:20,813
WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS WANT FROM 

10089
05:43:20,813 --> 05:43:22,614
HIM, THAT'S WHAT HE'S 

10090
05:43:22,614 --> 05:43:22,914
DELIVERING. 

10091
05:43:22,914 --> 05:43:23,481
AND YET THERE ARE SEEMINGLY 

10092
05:43:23,481 --> 05:43:24,015
MOMENTS DURING THIS PRESS 

10093
05:43:24,015 --> 05:43:25,784
CONFERENCE SPECIFICALLY WHERE 

10094
05:43:25,784 --> 05:43:26,352
HE SEEMED TO INDICATE, FOR 

10095
05:43:26,352 --> 05:43:26,985
EXAMPLE, WHEN THEY SAID, WELL, 

10096
05:43:26,985 --> 05:43:31,057
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO 

10097
05:43:31,057 --> 05:43:31,390
VERIFY THIS? 

10098
05:43:31,390 --> 05:43:32,525
AND IT'S BECAUSE I TRUST 

10099
05:43:32,525 --> 05:43:32,858
CHAIRMAN KIM. 

10100
05:43:32,858 --> 05:43:37,463
AND AT ONE POINT SAYING HOW CAN 

10101
05:43:37,463 --> 05:43:37,930
YOU ENSURE ANYTHING? 

10102
05:43:37,930 --> 05:43:38,530
I THINK AS WE GO BACK AND WE 

10103
05:43:38,530 --> 05:43:39,164
LOOK AT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, 

10104
05:43:39,164 --> 05:43:40,299
THERE IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE 

10105
05:43:40,299 --> 05:43:41,133
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS 

10106
05:43:41,133 --> 05:43:41,666
NEGOTIATION TAKES PLACE, 

10107
05:43:41,666 --> 05:43:42,300
BECAUSE GIVEN THE PRESIDENT IS 

10108
05:43:42,300 --> 05:43:47,006
A CHANGE AGENT, THIS USUALLY 

10109
05:43:47,006 --> 05:43:47,439
HAPPENS AT THE END. 

10110
05:43:47,439 --> 05:43:47,706
>> RIGHT. 

10111
05:43:47,706 --> 05:43:50,209
>> IN OTHER WORDS, SECRETARY 

10112
05:43:50,209 --> 05:43:50,776
POMPEO AND OTHER DIPLOMATS, 

10113
05:43:50,776 --> 05:43:51,343
BOLTON AND THE OTHERS, THEY 

10114
05:43:51,343 --> 05:43:51,810
HAMMER OUT ALL THESE 

10115
05:43:51,810 --> 05:43:53,478
AGREEMENTS, THEN THE PRESIDENT 

10116
05:43:53,478 --> 05:43:54,112
MEETS WITH THE LEADER OF NORTH 

10117
05:43:54,112 --> 05:43:54,746
KOREA AND WE COME AWAY WITH AN 

10118
05:43:54,746 --> 05:43:55,380
AGREEMENT AND A FRAMEWORK IN 

10119
05:43:55,380 --> 05:43:55,614
PLACE. 

10120
05:43:55,614 --> 05:43:57,917
THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. 

10121
05:43:57,917 --> 05:43:58,184
>> RIGHT. 

10122
05:43:58,184 --> 05:43:58,951
AND TO BE FAIR, EVEN THOSE WHO 

10123
05:43:58,951 --> 05:43:59,585
WERE IN HIGH NATIONAL 

10124
05:43:59,585 --> 05:44:02,020
SECURITY POSITIONS IN THE OBAMA 

10125
05:44:02,020 --> 05:44:02,621
ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING THE 

10126
05:44:02,621 --> 05:44:03,188
FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL

INTELLIGENCE JIM CLAPPER WHO IS 

10128
05:44:04,423 --> 05:44:05,024
NO FAN OF THIS PRESIDENT HAS 

10129
05:44:05,024 --> 05:44:12,865
SAID I GIVE HIM CREDIT ON THIS 

10130
05:44:12,865 --> 05:44:13,432
BECAUSE HE ADVOCATED, LOOK, 

10131
05:44:13,432 --> 05:44:15,968
YOU'VE GOTTA ENGAGE. 

10132
05:44:15,968 --> 05:44:18,904
AND IN A COUNTRY LIKE NORTH 

10133
05:44:18,904 --> 05:44:19,738
KOREA YOU DON'T HAVE 

10134
05:44:19,738 --> 05:44:20,372
BUREAUCRACIES AND PROFESSIONAL 

10135
05:44:20,372 --> 05:44:20,805
DIPLOMATS EMPOWERED 

10136
05:44:20,805 --> 05:44:22,775
IN THE WAY YOU MIGHT HAVE IN 

10137
05:44:22,775 --> 05:44:23,409
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT REALLY IN 

10138
05:44:23,409 --> 05:44:24,009
SOME WAYS THE ONLY PERSON WHO 

10139
05:44:24,009 --> 05:44:24,610
MATTERS IN TERMS OF DECISION 

10140
05:44:24,610 --> 05:44:25,911
MAKING IS THE GUY AT THE TOP, 

10141
05:44:25,911 --> 05:44:26,244
KIM JONG-UN. 

10142
05:44:26,244 --> 05:44:28,147
REMEMBER, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO, 

10143
05:44:28,147 --> 05:44:30,516
YES, IS SITTING ACROSS FROM THE 

10144
05:44:30,516 --> 05:44:31,183
MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD, 

10145
05:44:31,183 --> 05:44:32,284
THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, HE'S 

10146
05:44:32,284 --> 05:44:37,490
SOMEONE WHO'S ALSO MURDERED HIS 

10147
05:44:37,490 --> 05:44:37,857
FAMILY MEMBERS. 

10148
05:44:37,857 --> 05:44:39,091
HE IS SOMEONE WHO'S CARRIED OUT 

10149
05:44:39,091 --> 05:44:39,691
MASS SOME WOULD SAY GENOCIDE, 

10150
05:44:39,691 --> 05:44:44,930
CERTAINLY MASS KILLING OF HIS 

10151
05:44:44,930 --> 05:44:45,230
OWN PEOPLE, 

10152
05:44:45,230 --> 05:44:45,764
STARVATION, LABOR CAMPS, 

10153
05:44:45,764 --> 05:44:45,997
GULAGS. 

10154
05:44:45,997 --> 05:44:50,002
SO THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS 

10155
05:44:50,002 --> 05:44:50,502
TOTALITARIAN IN POWER. 

10156
05:44:50,502 --> 05:44:51,303
HE'S THE PERSON YOU'LL HAVE TO 

10157
05:44:51,303 --> 05:44:55,708
SIT AWAY FROM.THE UNITED STATES 

10158
05:44:55,708 --> 05:44:56,708
HAS BROKERED DEALS WITH BRUTAL 

10159
05:44:56,708 --> 05:44:58,477
MURDERERS IN THE PAST WHEN IT 

10160
05:44:58,477 --> 05:44:58,977
HAS SERVED THE NATIONAL 

10161
05:44:58,977 --> 05:44:59,611
SECURITY INTERESTS, AND THAT IS 

10162
05:44:59,611 --> 05:45:03,015
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO 

10163
05:45:03,015 --> 05:45:03,282
DO TODAY. 

10164
05:45:03,282 --> 05:45:04,082
IT IS A HUGE DIPLOMATIC GAMBLE, 

10165
05:45:04,082 --> 05:45:08,754
AND IT IS INTERESTING THAT HE'S 

10166
05:45:08,754 --> 05:45:10,423
WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK. 

10167
05:45:10,423 --> 05:45:13,993
AS YOU SAY, THE PEOPLE WEREN'T 

10168
05:45:13,993 --> 05:45:14,493
WILLING TO IN THE PAST. 

10169
05:45:14,493 --> 05:45:15,127
IT'S NOW GOING TO BE ALL IN THE 

10170
05:45:15,127 --> 05:45:15,394
DETAILS. 

10171
05:45:15,394 --> 05:45:17,663
THAT'S WHY JOURNALISTS WILL 

10172
05:45:17,663 --> 05:45:18,163
CONTINUE TO SCUTINIZE, 

10173
05:45:18,163 --> 05:45:18,797
ANALYSTS WILL CONTINUE TO PICK 

10174
05:45:18,797 --> 05:45:19,331
APART THESE DETAILS, NOT 

10175
05:45:19,331 --> 05:45:22,234
NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF ANY KIND 

10176
05:45:22,234 --> 05:45:22,634
OF POLITICS, BUT 

10177
05:45:22,634 --> 05:45:23,268
BECAUSE THIS HAS TO BE FLAWLESS 

10178
05:45:23,268 --> 05:45:26,372
IN EXECUTION FOR THIS GAMBLE TO 

10179
05:45:26,372 --> 05:45:26,639
PAY OFF. 

10180
05:45:26,639 --> 05:45:29,975
AND WHAT WE HAVE HEARD BEHIND 

10181
05:45:29,975 --> 05:45:31,043
THE SCENES IS THAT THE WHITE 

10182
05:45:31,043 --> 05:45:31,610
HOUSE AND OTHERS HAVE SAID, 

10183
05:45:31,610 --> 05:45:32,144
LOOK, IF WE CAN JUST GET 

10184
05:45:32,144 --> 05:45:37,349
INSPECTORS ON THE GROUND, IF WE 

10185
05:45:37,349 --> 05:45:38,684
CAN JUST GET THEM TO OPEN UP 

10186
05:45:38,684 --> 05:45:39,284
THE DOORS, LET OUR PEOPLE IN 

10187
05:45:39,284 --> 05:45:42,955
THERE, HAVE EYES ON, EARS ON, 

10188
05:45:42,955 --> 05:45:43,388
WALK AROUND SOME OF 

10189
05:45:43,388 --> 05:45:46,959
THESE SITES AND GET A GOOD 

10190
05:45:46,959 --> 05:45:51,864
SENSE OF THINGS BECAUSE IT'S 

10191
05:45:51,864 --> 05:45:53,865
SUCH A BLACK BOX. 

10192
05:45:53,865 --> 05:45:55,000
WE KNEW FAR MORE ABOUT IRAN AND 

10193
05:45:55,000 --> 05:45:55,601
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM THAN WE 

10194
05:45:55,601 --> 05:45:56,235
KNOW ABOUT NORTH KOREA BECAUSE 

10195
05:45:56,235 --> 05:45:57,636
OF OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION, 

10196
05:45:57,636 --> 05:45:58,236
BECAUSE OF SO MUCH OVER TIME. 

10197
05:45:58,236 --> 05:46:00,372
NORTH KOREA WE KNOW FAR LESS, 

10198
05:46:00,372 --> 05:46:00,905
AND WE'VE HEARD THAT FROM 

10199
05:46:00,905 --> 05:46:02,073
NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS 

10200
05:46:02,073 --> 05:46:02,407
FROM THE BUSH 

10201
05:46:02,407 --> 05:46:02,941
ADMINISTRATION, FROM THE 

10202
05:46:02,941 --> 05:46:03,508
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SAY, 

10203
05:46:03,508 --> 05:46:04,210
LOOK, IN THE PAST WHEN WE HAVE 

10204
05:46:04,210 --> 05:46:04,810
GOTTEN INSPECTORS IN THERE -- 

10205
05:46:04,810 --> 05:46:06,946
REMEMBER, THEY DID COME IN 

10206
05:46:06,946 --> 05:46:08,314
UNDER THAT 1994 AGREEMENT? 

10207
05:46:08,314 --> 05:46:08,681
>> I REMEMBER. 

10208
05:46:08,681 --> 05:46:11,050
>> AND THEY WERE THROWN OUT IN 

10209
05:46:11,050 --> 05:46:11,684
THE BUSH ERA WHEN THEY POINTED 

10210
05:46:11,684 --> 05:46:14,386
OUT THEY WERE CHEATING, THEY 

10211
05:46:14,386 --> 05:46:16,689
GOT ON THE GROUND AND SAID WE 

10212
05:46:16,689 --> 05:46:17,956
FOUND FAR MORE THAN WE EVER 

10213
05:46:17,956 --> 05:46:18,958
THOUGHT, AND THEY WERE 

10214
05:46:18,958 --> 05:46:19,591
ENRICHING AND DOING THINGS MORE 

10215
05:46:19,591 --> 05:46:20,292
AND BEYOND WHAT TH U.S. HAD 

10216
05:46:20,292 --> 05:46:20,692
THOUGHT POSSIBLE. 

10217
05:46:20,692 --> 05:46:26,431
SO IF THEY CAN AT LEAST GET IN 

10218
05:46:26,431 --> 05:46:30,936
THERE AND VERIFY, AND IT WAS 

10219
05:46:30,936 --> 05:46:32,371
OUR MAJOR GARRETT WHO ASKED 

10220
05:46:32,371 --> 05:46:32,971
ABOUT THAT, THE PRESIDENT WAS 

10221
05:46:32,971 --> 05:46:33,605
VAGUE, AS YOU SAY, BUT THAT'S 

10222
05:46:33,605 --> 05:46:35,040
WHEN IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO 

10223
05:46:35,040 --> 05:46:35,640
POMPEO AND BOLTON WORKING OUT 

10224
05:46:35,640 --> 05:46:38,410
HOW THIS WORKS AND BOLTON, SAY 

10225
05:46:38,410 --> 05:46:42,047
WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT HIS PAST 

10226
05:46:42,047 --> 05:46:42,982
COMMENTS IN POLITICS, HE IS 

10227
05:46:42,982 --> 05:46:45,251
SOMEONE WHO HAS A LOT OF 

10228
05:46:45,251 --> 05:46:45,818
EXPERIENCE IN ARMS CONTROL. 

10229
05:46:45,818 --> 05:46:46,585
>> WE'VE GOT JUST ABOUT TWO 

10230
05:46:46,585 --> 05:46:47,219
MINUTES LEFT, MARGARET, TO TALK 

10231
05:46:47,219 --> 05:46:47,519
ABOUT THIS. 

10232
05:46:47,519 --> 05:46:48,554
YOU POINT OUT THAT MAJOR DID 

10233
05:46:48,554 --> 05:46:50,089
ASK ABOUT THE VERIFYING OF -- 

10234
05:46:50,089 --> 05:46:50,723
AND HAVING INSPECTORS AND THE 

10235
05:46:50,723 --> 05:46:55,160
PRESIDENT SAYING, YEAH, YEAH, 

10236
05:46:55,160 --> 05:46:57,296
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE, WE'RE

10237
05:46:57,296 --> 05:46:59,031
GOING TO HAVE A COMBINATION OF 

10238
05:46:59,031 --> 05:46:59,631
AMERICANS AND PERHAPS OTHERS, 

10239
05:46:59,631 --> 05:47:02,067
WHY NOT PUT THAT IN THE 

10240
05:47:02,067 --> 05:47:02,667
AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE TODAY? 

10241
05:47:02,667 --> 05:47:03,268
AT LEAST SOMETHING CONCRETE? 

10242
05:47:03,268 --> 05:47:03,835
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING 

10243
05:47:03,835 --> 05:47:07,206
RIGHT NOW IS A LOT OF 

10244
05:47:07,206 --> 05:47:08,307
PEOPLE SAYING THIS THING IS 

10245
05:47:08,307 --> 05:47:08,907
VAGUE AND THE NORTH KOREANS, 

10246
05:47:08,907 --> 05:47:09,508
EVERY FOUR OF THOSE BULLET 

10247
05:47:09,508 --> 05:47:10,943
POINTS HAVE BEEN PROMISED IN 

10248
05:47:10,943 --> 05:47:11,443
1994 AND AGAIN IN 2000. 

10249
05:47:11,443 --> 05:47:13,746
>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING 

10250
05:47:13,746 --> 05:47:14,413
THEY HAVEN'T IRONED OUT. 

10251
05:47:14,413 --> 05:47:17,549
WE KNOW THE U.S. HAS PUT 

10252
05:47:17,549 --> 05:47:18,149
TOGETHER THEIR SORT OF DREAM 

10253
05:47:18,149 --> 05:47:19,051
TEAM THAT THEY WANT TO SEE WITH 

10254
05:47:19,051 --> 05:47:19,618
INSPECTORS AND PEOPLE WITH 

10255
05:47:19,618 --> 05:47:20,218
EXPERIENCE IN NUCLEAR POWER. 

10256
05:47:20,218 --> 05:47:21,086
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING JUST 

10257
05:47:21,086 --> 05:47:21,553
ANYONE CAN DO, RIGHT? 

10258
05:47:21,553 --> 05:47:23,622
YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO BUILD A 

10259
05:47:23,622 --> 05:47:25,624
NUCLEAR WEAPON, TO KNOW HOW TO 

10260
05:47:25,624 --> 05:47:25,991
TAKE IT APART. 

10261
05:47:25,991 --> 05:47:27,058
AND THERE'S A LIMITED NUMBER OF 

10262
05:47:27,058 --> 05:47:27,626
SCIENTISTS WHO CAN DO THAT. 

10263
05:47:27,626 --> 05:47:31,030
SO THE U.S. HAS BEEN PUTTING 

10264
05:47:31,030 --> 05:47:32,197
TOGETHER ALLIES, THE U.K., 

10265
05:47:32,197 --> 05:47:32,831
OTHERS HAVE OFFERED RESOURCES. 

10266
05:47:32,831 --> 05:47:33,364
SOME OF OUR ADVERSARIES, 

10267
05:47:33,364 --> 05:47:35,000
RUSSIA, CHINA, THEY'VE GOT 

10268
05:47:35,000 --> 05:47:36,502
EXPERIENCE WITH THAT. 

10269
05:47:36,502 --> 05:47:38,670
WE WANT THEM IN ON THIS. 

10270
05:47:38,670 --> 05:47:43,042
HAVING THOSE PEOPLE IN THERE IS 

10271
05:47:43,042 --> 05:47:47,212
SOMETHING THAT NORTH KOREA HAS 

10272
05:47:47,212 --> 05:47:47,546
TO AGREE TO. 

10273
05:47:47,546 --> 05:47:52,952
AND SO THEY MAY BE ABLE TO SAY, 

10274
05:47:52,952 --> 05:47:53,585
OH, YES TO THE AMERICANS, NO TO 

10275
05:47:53,585 --> 05:47:53,886
THE FRENCH. 

10276
05:47:53,886 --> 05:47:55,054
YES TO THE CHINESE, NO TO THE 

10277
05:47:55,054 --> 05:47:56,255
RUSSIANS, ALL THAT STUFF HAS TO 

10278
05:47:56,255 --> 05:47:56,622
BE NEGOTIATED. 

10279
05:47:56,622 --> 05:47:57,222
AND THAT IS WHERE IT CAN GET 

10280
05:47:57,222 --> 05:47:57,456
MESSY. 

10281
05:47:57,456 --> 05:47:58,257
KIM JONG-UN CAN DRAW THIS OUT 

10282
05:47:58,257 --> 05:47:58,890
FOR AS LONG AS HE WANTS. 

10283
05:47:58,890 --> 05:47:59,424
AND THAT IS THE RISK WITH 

10284
05:47:59,424 --> 05:48:01,459
DIPLOMACY, IT IS NOT WITHOUT A 

10285
05:48:01,459 --> 05:48:01,693
PRICE. 

10286
05:48:01,693 --> 05:48:01,993

FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, A

THE PRESIDENT SAID KIM 

10346
05:53:01,660 --> 05:53:02,561
COMMITTED TO DENUCLEARIZATION. 

10347
05:53:02,561 --> 05:53:03,895
HE ALSO SAID THE U.S. WOULD

VIOLATIONS, BUT EMPHASIZED 

10353

DENUCLEARIZATION -- HE WOULD

RATHER EMPHASIZE 

10355
05:53:15,206 --> 05:53:16,174
DENUCLEARIZATION WAS THE MAIN 

10356
05:53:16,174 --> 05:53:17,108
FOCUS OF THE TALKS. 

10357
05:53:17,108 --> 05:53:19,878
>>  THERE'S NO LIMIT TO WHAT 

10358

05:53:28,587 --> 05:53:32,023
THAT REALLY WANTS TO ENGAGE. 

10364
05:53:32,023 --> 05:53:36,194
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS BEFORE HIM AN 

10365
05:53:36,194 --> 05:53:37,629
OPPORTUNITY LIKE NO OTHER. 

10366
05:53:37,629 --> 05:53:39,264
TO BE REMEMBERED AS THE LEADER 

10367
05:53:39,264 --> 05:53:41,867
WHO USHERED IN A GLORIOUS NEW 

10368
05:53:41,867 --> 05:53:46,004
ERA OF SECURITY AND PROSPERITY 

10369
05:53:46,004 --> 05:53:46,671
FOR HIS PEOPLE. 

10370
05:53:46,671 --> 05:53:48,039
CHAIRMAN KIM AND I JUST SIGNED 

10371
05:53:48,039 --> 05:53:51,076
A JOINT STATEMENT IN WHICH HE 

10372
05:53:51,076 --> 05:53:52,778
REAFFIRMED HIS UNWAIVERRING 

10373
05:53:52,778 --> 05:53:54,780
COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE 

10374
05:53:54,780 --> 05:53:58,884
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAEN 

10375
05:53:58,884 --> 05:53:59,184
PENINSULA. 

10376
05:53:59,184 --> 05:54:01,586
WE ALSO AGREED TO VIGOROUS 

10377
05:54:01,586 --> 05:54:03,388
NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE 

10378
05:54:03,388 --> 05:54:06,057
AGREEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 

10379
05:54:06,057 --> 05:54:08,059
AND HE WANTS TO DO THAT. 

10380
05:54:08,059 --> 05:54:10,595
>>  CBS NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT 

10381
05:54:10,595 --> 05:54:14,266
REPORTER IS WITH ME NOW FROM 

10382
05:54:14,266 --> 05:54:14,566
SINGAPORE. 

10383
05:54:14,566 --> 05:54:16,334
SO, KILEY, WE KNOW THE 

10384
05:54:16,334 --> 05:54:17,869
PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG-UN 

10385
05:54:17,869 --> 05:54:19,971
SIGNED AN AGREEMENT THAT HAD 

10386
05:54:19,971 --> 05:54:21,440
FOUR COMPONENTS, BUT ALSO GAVE 

10387
05:54:21,440 --> 05:54:23,608
A LENGTHY PRESS CONFERENCE 

10388
05:54:23,608 --> 05:54:23,908
AFTERWARDS. 

10389
05:54:23,908 --> 05:54:25,377
CAN YOU SORT OF FLESH OUT WHAT 

10390
05:54:25,377 --> 05:54:27,479
WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT WHAT THE 

10391
05:54:27,479 --> 05:54:30,882
TWO LEADERS HAVE AGREED TO. 

10392
05:54:30,882 --> 05:54:32,784
>>  Reporter: BASICALLY, WHAT 

10393
05:54:32,784 --> 05:54:34,586
WE SAW TODAY WAS THAT THEY HAD 

10394
05:54:34,586 --> 05:54:36,888
A MEETING AND THEY AGREED TO 

10395
05:54:36,888 --> 05:54:40,192
WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY AGREED 

10396
05:54:40,192 --> 05:54:40,492
TO. 

10397
05:54:40,492 --> 05:54:43,695
THAT NORTH KOREA SAID IT WOULD 

10398
05:54:43,695 --> 05:54:45,063
DENUCLEARIZE, THAT THE U.S. 

10399
05:54:45,063 --> 05:54:48,834
WOULD PROVIDE NORTH KOREA WITH 

10400
05:54:48,834 --> 05:54:49,968
SECURITY ASSURANCES, AND THAT 

10401
05:54:49,968 --> 05:54:51,837
WAS BUILT ON A LITTLE BIT. 

10402
05:54:51,837 --> 05:54:53,271
IN THAT PRESS CONFERENCE THAT 

10403
05:54:53,271 --> 05:54:56,375
YOU JUST PLAYED A LITTLE BIT 

10404
05:54:56,375 --> 05:54:58,710
OF, TRUMP SAID THAT THE U.S. 

10405
05:54:58,710 --> 05:55:01,480
WOULD STOP ITS WAR GAMES IN 

10406
05:55:01,480 --> 05:55:02,013
SOUTH KOREA. 

10407
05:55:02,013 --> 05:55:04,583
NOW THAT IS SIGNIFICANT, 

10408
05:55:04,583 --> 05:55:07,686
BECAUSE DID IS BASICALLY 

10409
05:55:07,686 --> 05:55:08,987
GIVING, YOU KNOW, NORTH KOREA A 

10410
05:55:08,987 --> 05:55:12,724
BIT OF A WIN ON THE BOARD. 

10411
05:55:12,724 --> 05:55:14,393
THEY VIEW THOSE EXERCISES THAT 

10412
05:55:14,393 --> 05:55:17,195
THE U.S. DOES IN THE REGION AS 

10413
05:55:17,195 --> 05:55:19,765
PROVOCATIVE AND TRUMP USED THAT 

10414
05:55:19,765 --> 05:55:20,231
WORD HIMSELF. 

10415
05:55:20,231 --> 05:55:22,868
WHAT WE DIDN'T GET FROM 

10416
05:55:22,868 --> 05:55:24,770
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS HOW DUH 

10417
05:55:24,770 --> 05:55:25,670
NUCLEARIZATION, HOW THIS 

10418
05:55:25,670 --> 05:55:27,672
PROCESS IS GOING TO OCCUR, WHEN 

10419
05:55:27,672 --> 05:55:29,508
IT'S GOING TO OCCUR, WHAT IT'S 

10420
05:55:29,508 --> 05:55:31,510
GOING TO LOOK LIKE. 

10421
05:55:31,510 --> 05:55:34,479
HE SAID IT WILL BE VERIFYABLE. 

10422
05:55:34,479 --> 05:55:36,281
THEY WILL GET A LOT OF 

10423
05:55:36,281 --> 05:55:38,383
INDIVIDUALS IN THERE TO CHECK 

10424
05:55:38,383 --> 05:55:39,617
OUT THESE SITES. 

10425
05:55:39,617 --> 05:55:41,386
BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE 

10426
05:55:41,386 --> 05:55:42,920
DETAILS OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO 

10427
05:55:42,920 --> 05:55:43,187
SHAPE UP. 

10428
05:55:43,187 --> 05:55:45,090
>>  AND YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK 

10429
05:55:45,090 --> 05:55:46,892
AT THE FOUR POINTS, THE 

10430
05:55:46,892 --> 05:55:48,627
DOCUMENT THAT THE TWO LEADERS 

10431
05:55:48,627 --> 05:55:50,295
SIGNED, THE WORD THAT IS USED 

10432
05:55:50,295 --> 05:55:53,365
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPLETE 

10433
05:55:53,365 --> 05:55:56,268
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAEN 

10434
05:55:56,268 --> 05:55:57,269
PENINSULA IS REAFFIRMING, 

10435
05:55:57,269 --> 05:55:58,936
SUGGESTING THIS IS AN 

10436
05:55:58,936 --> 05:56:00,272
AFFIRMATION THAT HAS BEEN MADE 

10437
05:56:00,272 --> 05:56:01,672
BEFORE, AND NOTHING NEW. 

10438
05:56:01,672 --> 05:56:04,275
>>  Reporter: YEAH, EXACTLY. 

10439
05:56:04,275 --> 05:56:06,311
AND SO WE DID HEAR PRESIDENT 

10440
05:56:06,311 --> 05:56:08,580
TRUMP SAY THAT AN AGREEMENT 

10441
05:56:08,580 --> 05:56:12,084
THAT HE CAME TO WITH KIM JONG-

10442
05:56:12,084 --> 05:56:14,085
UN OUTSIDE OF THAT WRITTEN 

10443
05:56:14,085 --> 05:56:15,187
STATEMENT WAS THAT NORTH KOREA 

10444
05:56:15,187 --> 05:56:18,089
WAS GOING TO BLOW UP ONE OF THE 

10445
05:56:18,089 --> 05:56:21,893
-- DESTROY ONE OF ITS MISSILE 

10446
05:56:21,893 --> 05:56:22,627
ENGINE TESTING SITES. 

10447
05:56:22,627 --> 05:56:25,764
THAT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT 

10448
05:56:25,764 --> 05:56:26,064
DIRECTION. 

10449
05:56:26,064 --> 05:56:32,270
IF NORTH KOREA IS GOING TO MOVE 

10450
05:56:32,270 --> 05:56:32,803
TOWARD DENUCLEARIZATION. 

10451
05:56:32,803 --> 05:56:34,473
THERE ARE AS MANY AS 100 SITES 

10452
05:56:34,473 --> 05:56:36,874
THAT WOULD NEED TO BE 

10453
05:56:36,874 --> 05:56:38,310
THOROUGHLY INSPECTED IN ORDER 

10454
05:56:38,310 --> 05:56:41,012
TO GET A COMPLETE ASSESSMENT OF 

10455
05:56:41,012 --> 05:56:42,947
WHAT THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS 

10456
05:56:42,947 --> 05:56:44,716
ARSENAL OF NORTH KOREA LOOKS 

10457
05:56:44,716 --> 05:56:44,916
LIKE. 

10458
05:56:44,916 --> 05:56:46,318
BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT IS 

10459
05:56:46,318 --> 05:56:48,620
UNKNOWN TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. 

10460
05:56:48,620 --> 05:56:51,323
WE HAVEN'T SEEN, YOU KNOW, 

10461
05:56:51,323 --> 05:56:52,090
OUTSIDERS, INSPECTORS ON THE 

10462
05:56:52,090 --> 05:56:53,592
GROUND THERE IN YEARS NOW. 

10463
05:56:53,592 --> 05:56:55,927
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

10464
05:56:55,927 --> 05:56:58,864
ABOUT HOW MUCH WORK IS IN FRONT 

10465
05:56:58,864 --> 05:57:03,635
OF US AS TRUMP, YOU KNOW, 

10466
05:57:03,635 --> 05:57:04,970
CLAIMS VICTORY HERE. 

10467
05:57:04,970 --> 05:57:06,571
WITH KIM JONG-UN, BUT STILL HAS 

10468
05:57:06,571 --> 05:57:09,007
A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. 

10469
05:57:09,007 --> 05:57:10,709
HE DID ADMIT THERE MIGHT BE 

10470
05:57:10,709 --> 05:57:12,010
ANOTHER SUMMIT, THEY MAY NEED 

10471
05:57:12,010 --> 05:57:14,613
TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS. 

10472
05:57:14,613 --> 05:57:17,816
SECRETARY OF STATE, MIKE 

10473
05:57:17,816 --> 05:57:19,718
POMPEO, JOHN BOLTON, TRUMP SAID 

10474
05:57:19,718 --> 05:57:21,119
WILL BOTH BE CONTINUING TO WORK 

10475
05:57:21,119 --> 05:57:25,524
ON THIS AND MEETING WITH NORTH 

10476
05:57:25,524 --> 05:57:26,624
KOREANS IN THE FUTURE. 

10477
05:57:26,624 --> 05:57:28,426
WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR WHEN 

10478
05:57:28,426 --> 05:57:29,794
THOSE MEETINGS WILL GET GOING 

10479
05:57:29,794 --> 05:57:30,027
AGAIN. 

10480
05:57:30,027 --> 05:57:31,529
>>  YOU ARE SO RIGHT. 

10481
05:57:31,529 --> 05:57:32,597
A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION 

10482
05:57:32,597 --> 05:57:34,966
LEADING UP TO THIS SUMMIT HAD 

10483
05:57:34,966 --> 05:57:38,270
TO DO WITH THE DEFINITIONS, HOW 

10484
05:57:38,270 --> 05:57:40,772
THE TWO LEADERS DEFINE 

10485
05:57:40,772 --> 05:57:42,040
DENUCLEARIZATION, AND OTHER 

10486
05:57:42,040 --> 05:57:43,508
AREAS OF CONCERN. 

10487
05:57:43,508 --> 05:57:46,043
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT CONVERSATION 

10488
05:57:46,043 --> 05:57:46,343
CONTINUES. 

10489
05:57:46,343 --> 05:57:48,646
YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU VERIFY? 

10490
05:57:48,646 --> 05:57:51,149
HOW DO YOU DETERMINE ARE WE 

10491
05:57:51,149 --> 05:57:53,518
TALKING ABOUT SITES IN WHICH 

10492
05:57:53,518 --> 05:57:55,820
NORTH KOREA IDENTIFIES 

10493
05:57:55,820 --> 05:57:57,923
LOCATIONS THAT THEY HAVE 

10494
05:57:57,923 --> 05:58:00,425
NUCLEAR STOCKPILE, OR OTHER 

10495
05:58:00,425 --> 05:58:01,826
LOCATIONS THAT PERHAPS, BASED 

10496
05:58:01,826 --> 05:58:02,928
ON OUR INTELLIGENCE, WE WANT TO 

10497
05:58:02,928 --> 05:58:05,297
TAKE A LOOK AT OR THE 

10498
05:58:05,297 --> 05:58:06,064
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WANTS 

10499
05:58:06,064 --> 05:58:06,530
TO LOOK AT. 

10500
05:58:06,530 --> 05:58:08,500
IN TERMS OF THE WAR GAMES, 

10501
05:58:08,500 --> 05:58:10,368
SPECIFICALLY WHAT DOES THAT 

10502
05:58:10,368 --> 05:58:10,601
MEAN? 

10503
05:58:10,601 --> 05:58:11,970
NO WAR GAMES AT ALL? 

10504
05:58:11,970 --> 05:58:14,272
THESE WAR GAMES ARE ALL ABOUT 

10505
05:58:14,272 --> 05:58:15,373
MILITARY READINESS AND DEFENSE, 

10506
05:58:15,373 --> 05:58:18,610
SO DOES THAT MEAN YOU HAVE A 

10507
05:58:18,610 --> 05:58:21,379
MILITARY PRESENCE, BUT NO 

10508
05:58:21,379 --> 05:58:22,714
PRACTICE AT READINESS? 

10509
05:58:22,714 --> 05:58:24,115
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S STILL A 

10510
05:58:24,115 --> 05:58:27,018
LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS 

10511
05:58:27,018 --> 05:58:27,218
HERE. 

10512
05:58:27,218 --> 05:58:28,887
>>  Reporter: YEAH, I THINK 

10513
05:58:28,887 --> 05:58:29,454
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. 

10514
05:58:29,454 --> 05:58:33,124
THERE ARE A LOT OF UNANSWERED 

10515
05:58:33,124 --> 05:58:33,725
QUESTIONS. 

10516
05:58:33,725 --> 05:58:35,827
BUT YOU KNOW, I WATCHED TRUMP 

10517
05:58:35,827 --> 05:58:38,396
AND KIM JONG-UN SHAKE HANDS 

10518
05:58:38,396 --> 05:58:42,000
THIS MORNING NEXT TO ONE OF CBS 

10519
05:58:42,000 --> 05:58:43,034
NEWS CONTRIBUTORS WHO HAS 

10520
05:58:43,034 --> 05:58:45,804
WORKED AT THE CIA AND THE STATE 

10521
05:58:45,804 --> 05:58:46,104
DEPARTMENT. 

10522
05:58:46,104 --> 05:58:47,472
HE SAID HE'S BEEN WAITING 40 

10523
05:58:47,472 --> 05:58:49,808
YEARS TO SEE A HANDSHAKE LIKE 

10524
05:58:49,808 --> 05:58:50,942
THAT BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF 

10525
05:58:50,942 --> 05:58:52,276
THE UNITED STATES AND THE 

10526
05:58:52,276 --> 05:58:55,146
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA. 

10527
05:58:55,146 --> 05:58:56,715
SO, AGAIN, THERE IS SOME 

10528
05:58:56,715 --> 05:58:58,817
PROGRESS THAT WAS MADE HERE. 

10529
05:58:58,817 --> 05:59:01,319
YOU CAN'T UNDERMINE THAT. 

10530
05:59:01,319 --> 05:59:03,421
BUT, IN TERMS OF THESE 

10531
05:59:03,421 --> 05:59:05,523
NEGOTIATORS THAT HAVE BEEN 

10532
05:59:05,523 --> 05:59:09,427
WORKING TO TRY AND COME TO SOME 

10533
05:59:09,427 --> 05:59:10,996
SORT OF CONCRETE PLAN FORWARD, 

10534
05:59:10,996 --> 05:59:12,397
WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF 

10535
05:59:12,397 --> 05:59:17,067
THAT THEY HAVE GOTTEN ANYWHERE. 

10536
05:59:17,067 --> 05:59:19,571
WE HAD KIM WHO IS NOW THE U.S. 

10537
05:59:19,571 --> 05:59:22,607
AMBASSADOR TO THE PHILIPPINES, 

10538
05:59:22,607 --> 05:59:24,509
LEADING A DELEGATION FOR ABOUT 

10539
05:59:24,509 --> 05:59:26,711
TEN DAYS LEADING UP TO THIS 

10540
05:59:26,711 --> 05:59:28,413
SUMMIT TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND 

10541
05:59:28,413 --> 05:59:30,815
HOW THE U.S. AND NORTH KOREA 

10542
05:59:30,815 --> 05:59:33,351
CAN ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS. 

10543
05:59:33,351 --> 05:59:39,124
OBVIOUSLY, WITH THE AIM OF 

10544
05:59:39,124 --> 05:59:40,125
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION, AND 

10545
05:59:40,125 --> 05:59:42,427
IF TODAY IS ANY TEST FOR WHAT 

10546
05:59:42,427 --> 05:59:44,529
THEY WERE ABLE TO AGREE TO, 

10547
05:59:44,529 --> 05:59:46,898
WELL IT'S NOT MUCH. 

10548
05:59:46,898 --> 05:59:48,500
THEY STILL ARE VERY FAR FROM 

10549
05:59:48,500 --> 05:59:50,001
ONE ANOTHER IN TERMS OF HOW 

10550
05:59:50,001 --> 05:59:51,402
THEY WILL GET TO AN END STATE. 

10551
05:59:51,402 --> 05:59:54,105
>>  YEAH, BUT PERHAPS WE HAVE 

10552
05:59:54,105 --> 05:59:56,775
TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS 

10553
05:59:56,775 --> 05:59:57,308
PARTICULARLY HISTORIC. 

10554
05:59:57,308 --> 05:59:59,210
THIS IS FURTHER ALONG THAN MANY 

10555
05:59:59,210 --> 06:00:00,779
OF THE PAST ADMINISTRATIONS 

10556
06:00:00,779 --> 06:00:01,979
HAVE GOTTEN TO. 

10557
06:00:01,979 --> 06:00:03,181
AND THE PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGES 

10558
06:00:03,181 --> 06:00:05,216
THIS IS PART OF AN ON GOING 

10559
06:00:05,216 --> 06:00:05,549
CONVERSATION. 

10560
06:00:05,549 --> 06:00:07,352
THIS IS NOT THE BEGINNING, BY 

10561
06:00:07,352 --> 06:00:09,420
ANY MEANS AT ALL. 

10562
06:00:09,420 --> 06:00:10,622
THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY LEFT. 

10563
06:00:10,622 --> 06:00:12,824
HE IS BACK ON HIS WAY. 

10564
06:00:12,824 --> 06:00:14,726
BACK HOME TO WASHINGTON. 

10565
06:00:14,726 --> 06:00:16,094
AFTER THIS HISTORIC COUPLE OF 

10566
06:00:16,094 --> 06:00:17,228
DAYS IN SINGAPORE. 

10567
06:00:17,228 --> 06:00:18,797
HE ADDRESSED REPORTERS ON BOARD 

10568
06:00:18,797 --> 06:00:20,498
AIR FORCE ONE EARLIER TO TALK 

10569
06:00:20,498 --> 06:00:22,200
ABOUT THE MEETING WITH KIM JONG-

10570
06:00:22,200 --> 06:00:22,367
UN. 

10571
06:00:22,367 --> 06:00:24,903
HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. 

10572
06:00:24,903 --> 06:00:27,005
>>  I KNOW YOU SAID YOU 

10573
06:00:27,005 --> 06:00:28,273
COULDN'T GET EVERYTHING DONE 

10574
06:00:28,273 --> 06:00:28,640
YOU WANTED TO. 

10575
06:00:28,640 --> 06:00:31,342
>>  BASICALLY, GOING BACK TO 

10576
06:00:31,342 --> 06:00:33,845
THE HOTEL ROOM AND LEAVE 

10577
06:00:33,845 --> 06:00:34,112
TOMORROW. 

10578
06:00:34,112 --> 06:00:35,547
I WOULD RATHER FLY DURING THE 

10579
06:00:35,547 --> 06:00:37,248
NIGHT AND GET BACK. 

10580
06:00:37,248 --> 06:00:39,951
I HAD THE OPTION. 

10581
06:00:39,951 --> 06:00:41,419
YOU ALMOST DIDN'T, BECAUSE THEY 

10582
06:00:41,419 --> 06:00:42,620
WEREN'T PREPARED FOR THIS. 

10583
06:00:42,620 --> 06:00:44,122
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE 

10584
06:00:44,122 --> 06:00:45,824
TOMORROW MORNING AT 7:00, AND 

10585
06:00:45,824 --> 06:00:47,325
INSTEAD, WE'RE LEAVING TONIGHT, 

10586
06:00:47,325 --> 06:00:49,494
SO WE'LL BE ARRIVING WHEN WE'RE 

10587
06:00:49,494 --> 06:00:49,827
SUPPOSED TO. 

10588
06:00:49,827 --> 06:00:52,464
>>  WHEN DID YOU LET THEM KNOW 

10589
06:00:52,464 --> 06:00:52,897
YOU WERE LEAVING? 

10590
06:00:52,897 --> 06:00:55,500
>>  HE WAS RIGHT ON TIME. 

10591
06:00:55,500 --> 06:00:58,870
HE WAS RIGHT ON TIME. 

10592
06:00:58,870 --> 06:01:03,007
>>   THERE WAS NOTHING MORE WE 

10593
06:01:03,007 --> 06:01:03,407
COULD HAVE DONE. 

10594
06:01:03,407 --> 06:01:05,410
>>  WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS? 

10595
06:01:05,410 --> 06:01:11,282
>>  I WONDER IF HE'S -- LET ME 

10596
06:01:11,282 --> 06:01:11,850
ASK YOU THIS. 

10597
06:01:11,850 --> 06:01:13,351
SIT DOWN AND HAVE A GOOD 

10598
06:01:13,351 --> 06:01:13,585
FLIGHT. 

10599
06:01:13,585 --> 06:01:18,356
>>  CAN YOU COME VISIT WITH US 

10600
06:01:18,356 --> 06:01:18,689
MORE LATER? 

10601
06:01:18,689 --> 06:01:19,357
IT'S A LONG FLIGHT. 

10602
06:01:19,357 --> 06:01:21,892
>>  IT'S 26 HOURS, YOU ARE 

10603
06:01:21,892 --> 06:01:24,963
VULNERABLE IN 26 HOURS. 

10604
06:01:24,963 --> 06:01:26,197
YOU BECOME  VULNERABLE. 

10605
06:01:26,197 --> 06:01:27,331
STEVE WILL ASK ME ANOTHER 

10606
06:01:27,331 --> 06:01:27,598
QUESTION. 

10607
06:01:27,598 --> 06:01:30,034
>>  HOW IS THE FIRST LADY 

10608
06:01:30,034 --> 06:01:30,268
DOING? 

10609
06:01:30,268 --> 06:01:33,037
>>  SHE'S DOING GREAT. 

10610
06:01:33,037 --> 06:01:36,841
>>  SHE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO FLY. 

10611
06:01:36,841 --> 06:01:38,843
IN FACT, SHE WAS HANDING OUT 

10612
06:01:38,843 --> 06:01:41,579
THE AWARD LAST NIGHT. 

10613
06:01:41,579 --> 06:01:44,281
DO YOU HAVE ANY LINGERING 

10614
06:01:44,281 --> 06:01:44,682
CONCERNS ABOUT? 

10615
06:01:44,682 --> 06:01:46,751
>>  I CAN ONLY TELL YOU FROM 

10616
06:01:46,751 --> 06:01:48,953
THE TIME I DEALT WITH HIM, 

10617
06:01:48,953 --> 06:01:51,055
WHICH IS STARTING 90 DAYS AGO, 

10618
06:01:51,055 --> 06:01:52,156
IT'S BEEN VERY STRONG. 

10619
06:01:52,156 --> 06:01:54,159
I THINK HE WANTS TO GET IT 

10620
06:01:54,159 --> 06:01:54,359
DONE. 

10621
06:01:54,359 --> 06:01:56,161
AND WE SHOULD ALL WANT THAT TO 

10622
06:01:56,161 --> 06:01:56,394
HAPPEN. 

10623
06:01:56,394 --> 06:01:58,829
>>  EVEN A TINY BET OF YOU IS 

10624
06:01:58,829 --> 06:01:59,230
NOT DISAPPOINTED? 

10625
06:01:59,230 --> 06:02:06,971
>>  WE SET UP A PLATFORM. 

10626
06:02:06,971 --> 06:02:07,338
HE UNDERSTOOD. 

10627
06:02:07,338 --> 06:02:10,441
THE REMAINS, I ASKED HIM, SO 

10628
06:02:10,441 --> 06:02:12,343
MANY PEOPLE ASK ME THAT. 

10629
06:02:12,343 --> 06:02:13,945
THEIR SONS, THEIR FATHERS, SO 

10630
06:02:13,945 --> 06:02:19,551
MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME ABOUT 

10631
06:02:19,551 --> 06:02:20,251
THAT. 

10632
06:02:20,251 --> 06:02:22,554
I WOULD SAY TO MYSELF, AS SOON 

10633
06:02:22,554 --> 06:02:25,156
AS I HAVE MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY, 

10634
06:02:25,156 --> 06:02:27,391
COULD YOU DO WHAT HE SAID WE 

10635
06:02:27,391 --> 06:02:27,658
WILL DO? 

10636
06:02:27,658 --> 06:02:29,861
>>  AND HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE 

10637
06:02:29,861 --> 06:02:34,132
YOU GET PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE HE 

10638
06:02:34,132 --> 06:02:34,499
DENUCLEARIZES? 

10639
06:02:34,499 --> 06:02:35,966
>>  WE WILL CHECK IT. 

10640
06:02:35,966 --> 06:02:37,267
WE'LL CHECK IT STRONGLY. 

10641
06:02:37,267 --> 06:02:38,903
HE HAS A PLAN, TOTAL, AND 

10642
06:02:38,903 --> 06:02:39,170
COMPLETE. 

10643
06:02:39,170 --> 06:02:40,004
>>  YOU TRUST HIM? 

10644
06:02:40,004 --> 06:02:42,172
>>  I DO. 

10645
06:02:42,172 --> 06:02:45,443
AS I TOLD YOU. 

10646
06:02:45,443 --> 06:02:49,047
>>  THE TOTAL PLAN FOR TOTAL 

10647
06:02:49,047 --> 06:02:49,447
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

10648
06:02:49,447 --> 06:02:50,848
HE HAS A TOTAL PLAN? 

10649
06:02:50,848 --> 06:02:51,749
>>  YES. 

10650
06:02:51,749 --> 06:02:54,051
>>  THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 

10651
06:02:54,051 --> 06:02:55,653
>>  SO THAT'S WHAT THE 

10652
06:02:55,653 --> 06:02:57,755
PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS 

10653
06:02:57,755 --> 06:02:58,957
HISTORIC MEETING ON HIS WAY 

10654
06:02:58,957 --> 06:03:00,458
BACK TO WASHINGTON ON AIR FORCE 

10655
06:03:00,458 --> 06:03:02,660
ONE, THAT HE TOTALLY TRUSTS KIM 

10656
06:03:02,660 --> 06:03:04,062
JONG-UN AND BELIEVES HE HAS A 

10657
06:03:04,062 --> 06:03:07,031
TOTAL PLAN FOR A COMPLETE 

10658
06:03:07,031 --> 06:03:07,431
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

10659
06:03:07,431 --> 06:03:08,433
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF 

10660
06:03:08,433 --> 06:03:11,035
THINGS UP IN THE AIR ABOUT WHAT 

10661
06:03:11,035 --> 06:03:11,368
THAT MEANS. 

10662
06:03:11,368 --> 06:03:13,338
LIVE WE'VE BEEN SAYING, THIS IS 

10663
06:03:13,338 --> 06:03:15,139
HISTORIC, THIS IS FURTHER ALONG 

10664
06:03:15,139 --> 06:03:16,908
THAN ANY OTHER ADMINISTRATION 

10665
06:03:16,908 --> 06:03:17,808
MANAGED TO GET TO. 

10666
06:03:17,808 --> 06:03:22,080
WE WANT TO BRING IN AP'S WHITE 

10667
06:03:22,080 --> 06:03:24,215
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, ZEEK 

10668
06:03:24,215 --> 06:03:25,149
MILLER. 

10669
06:03:25,149 --> 06:03:25,649
YOU'RE IN SINGAPORE. 

10670
06:03:25,649 --> 06:03:27,352
YOU'RE ON THE PHONE JOINING US 

10671
06:03:27,352 --> 06:03:27,752
NOW. 

10672
06:03:27,752 --> 06:03:29,354
THE PRESIDENT GAVE A REALLY 

10673
06:03:29,354 --> 06:03:30,555
LENGTHY INTERVIEW AND HE 

10674
06:03:30,555 --> 06:03:31,756
REENFORCED SOME OF WHAT HE HAD 

10675
06:03:31,756 --> 06:03:35,260
TO SAY IN THAT INTERVIEW ON AIR 

10676
06:03:35,260 --> 06:03:35,560
FORCE ONE. 

10677
06:03:35,560 --> 06:03:39,430
ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT HE  

10678
06:03:39,430 --> 06:03:41,532
TRUSTS KIM JONG-UN, WHEN ASKED 

10679
06:03:41,532 --> 06:03:43,034
ABOUT VERIFICATION IN THAT 

10680
06:03:43,034 --> 06:03:44,736
PRESS CONFERENCE, HE SAID 

10681
06:03:44,736 --> 06:03:46,771
ESSENTIALLY, HE TRUSTED HIS GUT 

10682
06:03:46,771 --> 06:03:50,774
AND HIS INSTINCT. 

10683
06:03:50,774 --> 06:03:51,141
IS THAT ENOUGH? 

10684
06:03:51,141 --> 06:03:52,076
>>  Reporter: THAT IS NOT 

10685
06:03:52,076 --> 06:03:54,946
ENOUGH AT THE END OF THE DAY. 

10686
06:03:54,946 --> 06:03:58,650
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 

10687
06:03:58,650 --> 06:03:58,917
INSTINCT. 

10688
06:03:58,917 --> 06:04:00,251
IT WILL HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO 

10689
06:04:00,251 --> 06:04:02,920
WITH THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

10690
06:04:02,920 --> 06:04:04,621
IF NORTH KOREA IS BELIEVED TO 

10691
06:04:04,621 --> 06:04:07,792
HAVE BETWEEN 50 AND 60 ACTIVE 

10692
06:04:07,792 --> 06:04:10,161
WARHEADS, DO THEY LEAVE THE 

10693
06:04:10,161 --> 06:04:10,428
COUNTRY? 

10694
06:04:10,428 --> 06:04:11,729
THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT 

10695
06:04:11,729 --> 06:04:12,730
WILL DETERMINE SUCCESS OR 

10696
06:04:12,730 --> 06:04:14,665
FAILURE OF THIS SUMMIT. 

10697
06:04:14,665 --> 06:04:17,735
ULTIMATELY BY THE PRESIDENT, HE 

10698
06:04:17,735 --> 06:04:19,837
SAID COMPLETE VERIFYABLE, 

10699
06:04:19,837 --> 06:04:21,639
IRREVERSIBLE THE BE ALL AND END 

10700
06:04:21,639 --> 06:04:23,540
ALL FOR THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. 

10701
06:04:23,540 --> 06:04:25,843
IF HE CANNOT GET THERE, YES, IT 

10702
06:04:25,843 --> 06:04:27,779
WILL TAKE SOME TIME, BUT IF HE 

10703
06:04:27,779 --> 06:04:29,280
CAN'T GET THERE, ALL OF THIS 

10704
06:04:29,280 --> 06:04:31,482
WILL BE FOR NOT, BECAUSE WE SAW 

10705
06:04:31,482 --> 06:04:33,985
A LITTLE DURING THE PRESS 

10706
06:04:33,985 --> 06:04:35,954
CONFERENCE, SAYING YOU KNOW, IF 

10707
06:04:35,954 --> 06:04:37,855
IN SIX MONTHS, HE IS SAYING 

10708
06:04:37,855 --> 06:04:41,725
THIS WAS A FAILURE, HE-WRONG, 

10709
06:04:41,725 --> 06:04:43,394
HE WOULD COME UP WITH AN 

10710
06:04:43,394 --> 06:04:43,627
EXCUSE. 

10711
06:04:43,627 --> 06:04:47,632
>>  YEAH, HE DID. 

10712
06:04:47,632 --> 06:04:49,534
YOU KNOW, THE FOUR POINT 

10713
06:04:49,534 --> 06:04:51,836
DOCUMENT GAVE US INFORMATION, 

10714
06:04:51,836 --> 06:04:54,605
BUT HE REVEALED A LOT MORE IN 

10715
06:04:54,605 --> 06:04:56,273
HIS PRESS CONFERENCE. 

10716
06:04:56,273 --> 06:04:57,475
PERHAPS, PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN 

10717
06:04:57,475 --> 06:04:59,377
CAUGHT OFF GUARD WHEN HE TALKED 

10718
06:04:59,377 --> 06:05:01,579
ABOUT HIS INTENTION OR DESIRE 

10719
06:05:01,579 --> 06:05:04,082
TO MOVE U.S. TROOPS OUT OF 

10720
06:05:04,082 --> 06:05:05,683
SOUTH KOREA AND THEN HIS 

10721
06:05:05,683 --> 06:05:08,419
INTENTION TO END THE WAR GAMES. 

10722
06:05:08,419 --> 06:05:10,054
BUT THERE'S STILL QUESTIONS 

10723
06:05:10,054 --> 06:05:11,155
ABOUT THAT, SPECIFICALLY, WHAT 

10724
06:05:11,155 --> 06:05:12,990
DOES THAT MEAN AND IT'S MY 

10725
06:05:12,990 --> 06:05:14,659
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU KNOW, 

10726
06:05:14,659 --> 06:05:15,960
THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE TO DO 

10727
06:05:15,960 --> 06:05:17,462
WITH THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THE 

10728
06:05:17,462 --> 06:05:19,030
U.S. HAS WITH SOUTH KOREA AND 

10729
06:05:19,030 --> 06:05:22,133
NOT AN AGREEMENT WITH NORTH 

10730
06:05:22,133 --> 06:05:22,533
KOREA AT ALL. 

10731
06:05:22,533 --> 06:05:25,369
>>  THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. 

10732
06:05:25,369 --> 06:05:28,639
THE CLEAR THING ABOUT TODAY, 

10733
06:05:28,639 --> 06:05:31,476
THE BIGGEST TAKE AWAY, WE HAVE 

10734
06:05:31,476 --> 06:05:33,077
MORE QUESTIONS TODAY THAN WE 

10735
06:05:33,077 --> 06:05:33,578
HAD YESTERDAY. 

10736
06:05:33,578 --> 06:05:36,280
WE HAD MORE QUESTIONS ASKED. 

10737
06:05:36,280 --> 06:05:39,216
>>  YEAH, INDEED. 

10738
06:05:39,216 --> 06:05:41,386
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE 

10739
06:05:41,386 --> 06:05:41,686
QUESTIONS. 

10740
06:05:41,686 --> 06:05:42,854
CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, THE 

10741
06:05:42,854 --> 06:05:44,389
REMOVAL OF TROOPS, THE POSSIBLE 

10742
06:05:44,389 --> 06:05:46,424
REMOVAL OF TROOPS, THE ENDING 

10743
06:05:46,424 --> 06:05:47,524
OF THESE WAR GAMES. 

10744
06:05:47,524 --> 06:05:49,560
>>  CERTAINLY -- 

10745
06:05:49,560 --> 06:05:50,895
>>  SORRY, GO AHEAD. 

10746
06:05:50,895 --> 06:05:56,467
>>  WHEN IT COMES TO WAR GAMES, 

10747
06:05:56,467 --> 06:05:58,369
THAT IS SOMETHING I WILL 

10748
06:05:58,369 --> 06:05:59,771
CERTAINLY QUESTION U.S. 

10749
06:05:59,771 --> 06:06:01,472
ALLIANCES AROUND THE WORLD. 

10750
06:06:01,472 --> 06:06:02,706
THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT 

10751
06:06:02,706 --> 06:06:04,308
WANTS TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT. 

10752
06:06:04,308 --> 06:06:05,777
AND THAT'S SOMETHING MEMBERS OF 

10753
06:06:05,777 --> 06:06:07,311
THE PRESIDENT'S OWN PARTY BACK 

10754
06:06:07,311 --> 06:06:08,980
IN WASHINGTON WILL WANT TO HEAR 

10755
06:06:08,980 --> 06:06:10,181
MORE ABOUT, THEY WERE WARNING 

10756
06:06:10,181 --> 06:06:12,183
THE PRESIDENT NOT TO GIVE UP IN 

10757
06:06:12,183 --> 06:06:17,722
THE INITIAL AGREEMENT AND 

10758
06:06:17,722 --> 06:06:22,727
MAKING A FREEZE LIKE THAT, AND 

10759
06:06:22,727 --> 06:06:24,595
EMBRACING HIS RHETORIC, IS NOT 

10760
06:06:24,595 --> 06:06:26,330
A CONCESSION TO KIM JONG-UN. 

10761
06:06:26,330 --> 06:06:27,565
THAT THE PRESIDENT REALLY 

10762
06:06:27,565 --> 06:06:29,467
HASN'T GOTTEN A WHOLE LOT FOR. 

10763
06:06:29,467 --> 06:06:33,371
MAYBE IF THIS THING ULTIMATELY 

10764
06:06:33,371 --> 06:06:35,073
GETS THROUGH, IT WILL HAVE 

10765
06:06:35,073 --> 06:06:35,373
WORKED. 

10766
06:06:35,373 --> 06:06:40,043
IT'S A MASS UV RISK IVE RISK BY 

10767
06:06:40,043 --> 06:06:40,410
THE PRESIDENT. 

10768
06:06:40,410 --> 06:06:45,683
>>  COMPLETE, VERIFYABLE, 

10769
06:06:45,683 --> 06:06:46,317
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION. 

10770
06:06:46,317 --> 06:06:47,585
THAT'S THE PHRASE WE HEARD OVER 

10771
06:06:47,585 --> 06:06:48,519
AND OVER AGAIN. 

10772
06:06:48,519 --> 06:06:49,787
IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T 

10773
06:06:49,787 --> 06:06:52,824
BRING IT UP IN HIS PRESS 

10774
06:06:52,824 --> 06:06:53,257
CONFERENCE EITHER. 

10775
06:06:53,257 --> 06:06:54,792
SO, THERE ARE A LOT OF OPEN 

10776
06:06:54,792 --> 06:06:56,994
ENDED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW DO 

10777
06:06:56,994 --> 06:06:57,327
YOU VERIFY? 

10778
06:06:57,327 --> 06:06:58,295
THE PRESIDENT COULDN'T ANSWER 

10779
06:06:58,295 --> 06:07:01,566
THAT QUESTION IN HIS PRESS 

10780
06:07:01,566 --> 06:07:01,866
CONFERENCE. 

10781
06:07:01,866 --> 06:07:05,169
WHEN IT COMES TO LOOKING INTO 

10782
06:07:05,169 --> 06:07:08,272
SUSPECT SITES, DO WE GO BY WHAT 

10783
06:07:08,272 --> 06:07:09,907
THE NORTH KOREANS WANT TO 

10784
06:07:09,907 --> 06:07:12,310
ACKNOWLEDGE OR DO WE GO BY WHAT 

10785
06:07:12,310 --> 06:07:14,912
LIMITED INTELLIGENCE MAY BE 

10786
06:07:14,912 --> 06:07:16,514
SUGGESTING ARE SITES OF 

10787
06:07:16,514 --> 06:07:16,781
CONCERN? 

10788
06:07:16,781 --> 06:07:17,715
THERE'S ALSO SORTS OF THINGS 

10789
06:07:17,715 --> 06:07:19,082
THAT ARE OPEN ENDED HERE. 

10790
06:07:19,082 --> 06:07:23,521
>>  THE PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED 

10791
06:07:23,521 --> 06:07:25,188
THAT U.S. INTELLIGENCE LIMITED, 

10792
06:07:25,188 --> 06:07:27,492
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW, IT'S A 

10793
06:07:27,492 --> 06:07:29,427
VAST PROGRAM THAT IS WELL 

10794
06:07:29,427 --> 06:07:33,464
DEVELOPED AND HAS BEEN WELL 

10795
06:07:33,464 --> 06:07:38,236
DEVELOPED -- DESIGNED TO EVADE 

10796
06:07:38,236 --> 06:07:38,835
DETECTION FOR DECADES. 

10797
06:07:38,835 --> 06:07:41,838
THIS WILL BE A LARGE ENDEAVOR. 

10798
06:07:41,838 --> 06:07:43,207
WITH THAT, SAYING THEY WILL BE 

10799
06:07:43,207 --> 06:07:44,675
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO GO IN. 

10800
06:07:44,675 --> 06:07:46,911
BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS 

10801
06:07:46,911 --> 06:07:48,713
THAT HAS NOT BEEN WORKED OUT IN 

10802
06:07:48,713 --> 06:07:49,013
THE EAST. 

10803
06:07:49,013 --> 06:07:50,815
THIS HAS BEEN WORKED OUT IN THE 

10804
06:07:50,815 --> 06:07:53,117
PAST AND OTHER AGREEMENTS THAT 

10805
06:07:53,117 --> 06:07:55,920
HAVE ULTIMATELY FALLEN APART, 

10806
06:07:55,920 --> 06:07:56,821
THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT 

10807
06:07:56,821 --> 06:07:59,157
THAT'S THE SORT OF DETAIL HE 

10808
06:07:59,157 --> 06:08:01,192
WAS GOING TO LEAVE TO HIS 

10809
06:08:01,192 --> 06:08:04,228
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM, EITHER 

10810
06:08:04,228 --> 06:08:05,796
JOHN BOLTON, MIKE POMPEO, AND 

10811
06:08:05,796 --> 06:08:07,865
OTHERS THAT WILL TALK TO THE 

10812
06:08:07,865 --> 06:08:08,732
NORTH KOREAN COUNTERPARTS NEXT 

10813
06:08:08,732 --> 06:08:08,932
WEEK. 

10814
06:08:08,932 --> 06:08:11,502
>>  SOME OBSERVERS MAY BE 

10815
06:08:11,502 --> 06:08:12,770
DISAPPOINTED IN, THE LIMITED 

10816
06:08:12,770 --> 06:08:14,472
DISCUSSION ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 

10817
06:08:14,472 --> 06:08:14,772
VIOLATIONS. 

10818
06:08:14,772 --> 06:08:16,106
THE PRESIDENT SAID IT CAME UP, 

10819
06:08:16,106 --> 06:08:18,509
BUT IT CERTAINLY WASN'T A TOP 

10820
06:08:18,509 --> 06:08:23,414
PRIORITY IN THE CONVERSATION. 

10821
06:08:23,414 --> 06:08:26,217
HE CREDITED OTTO AS BEING PART 

10822
06:08:26,217 --> 06:08:28,019
OF THE CATALYST FOR THE 

10823
06:08:28,019 --> 06:08:30,354
DISCUSSIONS AND FOR THE SUMMIT. 

10824
06:08:30,354 --> 06:08:33,224
SAYING YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T DIE 

10825
06:08:33,224 --> 06:08:33,924
IN VAIN. 

10826
06:08:33,924 --> 06:08:36,594
BUT, WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT 

10827
06:08:36,594 --> 06:08:38,429
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS KIND OF 

10828
06:08:38,429 --> 06:08:40,831
RECEIVE SUCH LITTLE TIME WITH 

10829
06:08:40,831 --> 06:08:41,164
THIS SUMMIT? 

10830
06:08:41,164 --> 06:08:43,167
>>  IT'S REALLY NOT SURPRISING, 

10831
06:08:43,167 --> 06:08:44,669
IF YOU LOOK THE WAY THE 

10832
06:08:44,669 --> 06:08:46,971
PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THESE 

10833
06:08:46,971 --> 06:08:47,371
ISSUES. 

10834
06:08:47,371 --> 06:08:50,007
IT'S OVER THE COURSE OF HIS 

10835
06:08:50,007 --> 06:08:51,108
CANDIDACY, YOU KNOW, THE 

10836
06:08:51,108 --> 06:08:53,411
PRESIDENT TAKING ON A VERY 

10837
06:08:53,411 --> 06:08:55,112
NARROW VIEW OF WHAT IS AMERICAN 

10838
06:08:55,112 --> 06:08:57,315
INTEREST AND HE MADE HIS 

10839
06:08:57,315 --> 06:08:58,682
CAMPAIGN PROMISE, AMERICA 

10840
06:08:58,682 --> 06:08:58,916
FIRST. 

10841
06:08:58,916 --> 06:09:02,320
EMBRACED THAT TOWARD THE END OF 

10842
06:09:02,320 --> 06:09:02,653
HIS CAMPAIGN. 

10843
06:09:02,653 --> 06:09:04,722
THE WAY HE VIEWED AMERICAN 

10844
06:09:04,722 --> 06:09:07,124
INTEREST, HUMAN RIGHTS IS NOT 

10845
06:09:07,124 --> 06:09:08,458
PART OF AMERICAN INTEREST. 

10846
06:09:08,458 --> 06:09:10,328
IT HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF THE WEST 

10847
06:09:10,328 --> 06:09:11,829
QUARTERS, MEANS IT'S NOT OUR 

10848
06:09:11,829 --> 06:09:12,096
PROBLEM. 

10849
06:09:12,096 --> 06:09:13,263
THAT MEANS THAT THE PRESIDENT 

10850
06:09:13,263 --> 06:09:15,499
DOESN'T BELIEVE HE HAS TO RAISE 

10851
06:09:15,499 --> 06:09:15,832
THOSE ISSUES. 

10852
06:09:15,832 --> 06:09:17,702
BUT THE SAME FORCE, AS OTHER 

10853
06:09:17,702 --> 06:09:21,805
PRESIDENTS WHO TRIED TO PROTECT 

10854
06:09:21,805 --> 06:09:23,440
THE MORAL AUTHORITY OF THE 

10855
06:09:23,440 --> 06:09:25,543
UNITED STATES, THAT'S NOT HIS 

10856
06:09:25,543 --> 06:09:28,412
JOB, IF YOU CAN OBTAIN PROGRESS 

10857
06:09:28,412 --> 06:09:30,848
ON A NUCLEAR QUESTION, HE CAN 

10858
06:09:30,848 --> 06:09:35,620
GIVE KIM THE VICTORY OF THAT 

10859
06:09:35,620 --> 06:09:36,821
PHOTO OP, SAYING MAYBE HE'S 

10860
06:09:36,821 --> 06:09:39,724
GOING TO SAVE AS MANY AS 30 

10861
06:09:39,724 --> 06:09:40,357
MILLION LIVES. 

10862
06:09:40,357 --> 06:09:42,326
THAT ALSO APPLIES TO NOT 

10863
06:09:42,326 --> 06:09:44,729
BRINGING UP ISSUES, LIKE HUMAN 

10864
06:09:44,729 --> 06:09:46,097
RIGHTS LIKE THAT, WHERE THE 

10865
06:09:46,097 --> 06:09:49,467
PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO MAKE 

10866
06:09:49,467 --> 06:09:50,334
THE CHALLENGING COMPROMISES. 

10867
06:09:50,334 --> 06:09:52,103
AND IT'S NOT THAT OTHER 

10868
06:09:52,103 --> 06:09:54,705
PRESIDENTS HAVEN'T HAD TO MAKE 

10869
06:09:54,705 --> 06:09:57,842
THOSE COMPROMISES, SHOW ALL OF 

10870
06:09:57,842 --> 06:10:01,812
HIS CARDS, BUT THERE'S NO HINT 

10871
06:10:01,812 --> 06:10:03,047
OF ANY WANDERY HERE. 

10872
06:10:03,047 --> 06:10:04,515
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T FEEL THE 

10873
06:10:04,515 --> 06:10:06,183
NEED TO RAISE THOSE ISSUES. 

10874
06:10:06,183 --> 06:10:08,252
>>  I THINK PART OF WHAT MADE 

10875
06:10:08,252 --> 06:10:09,820
THAT PRESS CONFERENCE SO 

10876
06:10:09,820 --> 06:10:11,222
REMARKABLE IS YEAH, THE 

10877
06:10:11,222 --> 06:10:12,456
PRESIDENT CERTAINLY WAS PRETTY 

10878
06:10:12,456 --> 06:10:14,859
DIRECT ABOUT IT AND 

10879
06:10:14,859 --> 06:10:16,427
UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT SOME OF THE 

10880
06:10:16,427 --> 06:10:18,229
THINGS THAT THEY DISCUSSED AND 

10881
06:10:18,229 --> 06:10:20,298
HIS PERSPECTIVE AND POINT OF 

10882
06:10:20,298 --> 06:10:20,498
VIEW. 

10883
06:10:20,498 --> 06:10:22,299
IT WENT ON FOR OVER AN HOUR. 

10884
06:10:22,299 --> 06:10:24,502
HE TOOK QUESTIONS FROM 

10885
06:10:24,502 --> 06:10:25,603
JOURNALISTS, INCLUDING 

10886
06:10:25,603 --> 06:10:27,805
JOURNALISTS THAT REPRESENT 

10887
06:10:27,805 --> 06:10:29,640
PUBLICATIONS OR BROADCASTS THAT 

10888
06:10:29,640 --> 06:10:31,876
HE CONSIDERS UNFAVORABLE TO 

10889
06:10:31,876 --> 06:10:32,243
HIM. 

10890
06:10:32,243 --> 06:10:33,244
HE CERTAINLY WAS FEELING VERY 

10891
06:10:33,244 --> 06:10:35,980
GOOD ABOUT THIS SUMMIT. 

10892
06:10:35,980 --> 06:10:38,749
>>  YOU KNOW, THE REALLY BIG 

10893
06:10:38,749 --> 06:10:42,219
TAKE AWAY FROM THAT, THE PRESS 

10894
06:10:42,219 --> 06:10:43,153
CONFERENCE IS GOOD. 

10895
06:10:43,153 --> 06:10:44,888
DOES HE HAVE REASON TO? 

10896
06:10:44,888 --> 06:10:47,325
HE DID HAVE THIS BIG MOMENT ON 

10897
06:10:47,325 --> 06:10:49,460
THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE, BUT 

10898
06:10:49,460 --> 06:10:51,429
SOMETHING THAT IS TOO SOON TO 

10899
06:10:51,429 --> 06:10:51,629
TELL. 

10900
06:10:51,629 --> 06:10:53,030
IN THREE OR FOUR MONTHS, THIS 

10901
06:10:53,030 --> 06:11:00,671
COULD TURN OUT TO BE A MASSIVE 

10902
06:11:00,671 --> 06:11:01,539
REGRET. 

10903
06:11:01,539 --> 06:11:03,207
STOCKPILED, MISSILE PROGRAM 

10904
06:11:03,207 --> 06:11:04,207
GROWTH MORE ADVANCED. 

10905
06:11:04,207 --> 06:11:06,577
THAT IS A RISK HERE THAT THE 

10906
06:11:06,577 --> 06:11:07,678
PRESIDENT IS TAKING. 

10907
06:11:07,678 --> 06:11:09,647
IT LOOKED LIKE HE HAD BEEN 

10908
06:11:09,647 --> 06:11:11,682
PLAYED THE MASTER DEAL MAKER. 

10909
06:11:11,682 --> 06:11:13,951
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES HE HAS 

10910
06:11:13,951 --> 06:11:14,251
ASSURANCES. 

10911
06:11:14,251 --> 06:11:15,453
NORTH KOREA HAS GIVEN 

10912
06:11:15,453 --> 06:11:17,054
ASSURANCES BEFORE AND HAS GONE 

10913
06:11:17,054 --> 06:11:17,855
BACK ON THEM. 

10914
06:11:17,855 --> 06:11:18,823
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THIS 

10915
06:11:18,823 --> 06:11:19,823
TIME IS DIFFERENT. 

10916
06:11:19,823 --> 06:11:21,359
WE DON'T SEE THE EVIDENCE OF 

10917
06:11:21,359 --> 06:11:22,727
THAT RIGHT NOW, OTHER THAN THIS 

10918
06:11:22,727 --> 06:11:24,328
FACE TO FACE MEETING BETWEEN 

10919
06:11:24,328 --> 06:11:27,598
THE PRESIDENT AND THE NORTH 

10920
06:11:27,598 --> 06:11:27,965
KOREAN LEADER. 

10921
06:11:27,965 --> 06:11:30,735
THAT IS NOT THE TYPE OF THING 

10922
06:11:30,735 --> 06:11:31,501
YOU WOULD THINK ON. 

10923
06:11:31,501 --> 06:11:34,739
>>  SPEAKING OF TRACK RECORDS, 

10924
06:11:34,739 --> 06:11:36,107
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BEEN, 

10925
06:11:36,107 --> 06:11:37,975
IN THE PAST, PARTICULARLY 

10926
06:11:37,975 --> 06:11:39,377
CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT OBAMA 

10927
06:11:39,377 --> 06:11:41,746
AFTER HE REACHED OUT TO CUBA, 

10928
06:11:41,746 --> 06:11:42,847
CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT OBAMA 

10929
06:11:42,847 --> 06:11:45,649
WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD BE 

10930
06:11:45,649 --> 06:11:51,255
WILLING TO SPEAK WITH NO 

10931
06:11:51,255 --> 06:11:51,622
PRECONDITIONS. 

10932
06:11:51,622 --> 06:11:52,656
WE ARE GETTING A DIFFERENT FEEL 

10933
06:11:52,656 --> 06:11:55,559
HERE IN REGARDS TO PRESIDENT 

10934
06:11:55,559 --> 06:11:55,792
TRUMP. 

10935
06:11:55,792 --> 06:11:57,461
THERE IS NO SURPRISE IN TERMS 

10936
06:11:57,461 --> 06:11:57,862
OF THAT. 

10937
06:11:57,862 --> 06:12:00,030
IF THIS SHOULD NOT PAN OUT, DO 

10938
06:12:00,030 --> 06:12:02,032
YOU EXPECT THAT THE PRESIDENT 

10939
06:12:02,032 --> 06:12:04,001
WILL HEAR SOME HARSH WORDS FROM 

10940
06:12:04,001 --> 06:12:04,434
HIS OWN PARTY? 

10941
06:12:04,434 --> 06:12:07,138
>>  I THINK THERE WILL 

10942
06:12:07,138 --> 06:12:08,739
CERTAINLY BE HARSH WORDS FROM 

10943
06:12:08,739 --> 06:12:13,710
THE PRESIDENT'S OWN PARTY. 

10944
06:12:13,710 --> 06:12:14,110
TEMPERED WORDS. 

10945
06:12:14,110 --> 06:12:15,612
DIFFERENT LANGUAGE, THE 

10946
06:12:15,612 --> 06:12:19,750
RELATION OF SOUTH KOREA, THE 

10947
06:12:19,750 --> 06:12:30,127
PRESIDENT -- THE JOUR ALL  -- 

10948
06:12:30,127 --> 06:12:31,127
IN AMERICAN POLITICS. 

10949
06:12:31,127 --> 06:12:34,331
AND THAT IS THE TRUE POLITICAL 

10950
06:12:34,331 --> 06:12:35,533
FACT THERE, IF THIS DOESN'T 

10951
06:12:35,533 --> 06:12:40,137
SEEM TO BE GOING VERY WELL, IF 

10952
06:12:40,137 --> 06:12:44,475
NORTH KOREA SEEMS TO GO BACK ON 

10953
06:12:44,475 --> 06:12:46,377
SOME COMMITMENTS, YOU'LL SEE 

10954
06:12:46,377 --> 06:12:47,077
MORE CRITICISM. 

10955
06:12:47,077 --> 06:12:48,279
BY AND LARGE, THE POLITICAL 

10956
06:12:48,279 --> 06:12:51,048
PARTY WILL STAY WITH HIM, 

10957
06:12:51,048 --> 06:12:52,483
BECAUSE THAT'S THE NATURE OF 

10958
06:12:52,483 --> 06:12:53,016
AMERICAN POLITICS TODAY. 

10959
06:12:53,016 --> 06:12:54,852
>>  ZEEK MILLER FROM A.P., 

10960
06:12:54,852 --> 06:12:56,387
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

10961
06:12:56,387 --> 06:12:59,056
I WANT TO THANK KILEY ATWOOD AS 

10962
06:12:59,056 --> 06:12:59,557
WELL. 

10963
06:12:59,557 --> 06:13:01,058
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL TALK 

10964
06:13:01,058 --> 06:13:01,892
WITH BEN TRACY. 

10965
06:13:01,892 --> 06:13:07,331
HE IS STANDING BY IN SINGAPORE. 

10966
06:16:34,538 --> 06:16:38,509
>>> THERE YOU HAVE A LOOK AT 

10967
06:16:38,509 --> 06:16:38,809
SINGAPORE. 

10968
06:16:38,809 --> 06:16:39,276
BEAUTIFUL SINGAPORE. 

10969
06:16:39,276 --> 06:16:39,943
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS WELL 

10970
06:16:39,943 --> 06:16:43,881
ON HIS WAY TO WASHINGTON, 

10971
06:16:43,881 --> 06:16:46,183
HAVING LEFT HISTORIC SUMMIT IN 

10972
06:16:46,183 --> 06:16:47,051
SINGAPORE. 

10973
06:16:47,051 --> 06:16:50,187
AND  NORTH KOREAN LEADER ALSO 

10974
06:16:50,187 --> 06:16:52,589
HEADED BACK TO NORTH KOREA. 

10975
06:16:52,589 --> 06:16:55,292
AFTER WHAT MANY HAVE CALLED 

10976
06:16:55,292 --> 06:16:57,261
REMARKABLE, SURPRISING, AND 

10977
06:16:57,261 --> 06:16:58,428
CERTAINLY HISTORIC TALKS. 

10978
06:16:58,428 --> 06:16:59,897
CBS NEWS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, 

10979
06:16:59,897 --> 06:17:03,534
BEN TRACY, IS JOINING ME NOW 

10980
06:17:03,534 --> 06:17:03,934
FROM SINGAPORE. 

10981
06:17:03,934 --> 06:17:06,937
BEN, YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN 

10982
06:17:06,937 --> 06:17:07,270
NORTH KOREA. 

10983
06:17:07,270 --> 06:17:09,640
YOU WERE THERE WHEN THE NORTH 

10984
06:17:09,640 --> 06:17:11,008
KOREANS DESTROYED, WHAT THEY 

10985
06:17:11,008 --> 06:17:13,210
SAID WAS DESTROYING A NUCLEAR 

10986
06:17:13,210 --> 06:17:13,510
TEST SITE. 

10987
06:17:13,510 --> 06:17:14,878
AND NOW, WE'RE HEARING THERE IS 

10988
06:17:14,878 --> 06:17:16,980
SOME SORT OF COMMITMENT TO 

10989
06:17:16,980 --> 06:17:20,184
CONTINUE THAT PROCESS OF 

10990
06:17:20,184 --> 06:17:22,586
DENUCLEARIZING THE KOREAEN 

10991
06:17:22,586 --> 06:17:23,053
PENINSULA. 

10992
06:17:23,053 --> 06:17:24,854
BUT THE QUESTION OF 

10993
06:17:24,854 --> 06:17:26,356
VERIFICATION HAS COME UP. 

10994
06:17:26,356 --> 06:17:27,791
WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING THAT 

10995
06:17:27,791 --> 06:17:29,893
TEST SITE BEING DESTROYED, THEY 

10996
06:17:29,893 --> 06:17:32,162
DID NOT ALLOW ANY EXPERTS THERE 

10997
06:17:32,162 --> 06:17:33,864
TO WITNESS IT. 

10998
06:17:33,864 --> 06:17:35,466
SO ESSENTIALLY, IT WAS A NUMBER 

10999
06:17:35,466 --> 06:17:37,267
OF JOURNALISTS WHO KNOW A LOT, 

11000
06:17:37,267 --> 06:17:38,669
BUT NOT NECESSARILY ENOUGH 

11001
06:17:38,669 --> 06:17:40,037
ABOUT NUCLEAR SITES TO KNOW 

11002
06:17:40,037 --> 06:17:41,138
WHETHER THEY WERE SIGNIFICANT 

11003
06:17:41,138 --> 06:17:44,240
OR WHETHER OR NOT THAT SITE WAS 

11004
06:17:44,240 --> 06:17:44,541
DESTROYED. 

11005
06:17:44,541 --> 06:17:45,809
>>  Reporter: I WILL FULLY 

11006
06:17:45,809 --> 06:17:48,479
ADMIT I DO NOT HAVE THE SKILLS 

11007
06:17:48,479 --> 06:17:55,686
TO VERIFY THE DECERTIFY CATION 

11008
06:17:55,686 --> 06:17:57,488
DENUCLEARIZATION OF A TEST 

11009
06:17:57,488 --> 06:17:57,688
SITE. 

11010
06:17:57,688 --> 06:17:59,189
ALL WE COULD TELL WERE THE 

11011
06:17:59,189 --> 06:18:00,691
ENTRANCES OF THE TUNNELS WERE 

11012
06:18:00,691 --> 06:18:01,457
BLOWN UP. 

11013
06:18:01,457 --> 06:18:02,993
IF THE TUNNELS THAT STRETCH 

11014
06:18:02,993 --> 06:18:04,895
MILES INTO THOSE MOUNTAINS 

11015
06:18:04,895 --> 06:18:05,762
AREN'T ACTUALLY DESTROYED, THEY 

11016
06:18:05,762 --> 06:18:08,365
COULD BRING THAT SITE BACK 

11017
06:18:08,365 --> 06:18:09,666
ONLINE AND THEORETICALLY, START 

11018
06:18:09,666 --> 06:18:10,968
TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS THERE 

11019
06:18:10,968 --> 06:18:11,201
AGAIN. 

11020
06:18:11,201 --> 06:18:12,870
BUT THE NORTH KOREANS DID VIEW 

11021
06:18:12,870 --> 06:18:15,139
THAT AS A DOWN PAYMENT, A GOOD 

11022
06:18:15,139 --> 06:18:17,474
FAITH EFFORT TO SHOW THEY PLAN 

11023
06:18:17,474 --> 06:18:18,875
TO DISMANTEL THEIR PROGRAM. 

11024
06:18:18,875 --> 06:18:20,711
IF THEY DON'T ALLOW IN 

11025
06:18:20,711 --> 06:18:22,679
INSPECTORS TO VERIFY THAT THIS 

11026
06:18:22,679 --> 06:18:24,615
HAS BEEN DONE, WE WILL NEVER 

11027
06:18:24,615 --> 06:18:26,984
KNOW IF NORTH KOREA HAS TAKEN 

11028
06:18:26,984 --> 06:18:27,317
THE STEPS. 

11029
06:18:27,317 --> 06:18:28,719
THAT IS THE PROBLEM COMING OUT 

11030
06:18:28,719 --> 06:18:31,121
OF THE SUMMIT TODAY. 

11031
06:18:31,121 --> 06:18:35,025
THERE IS THIS VAGUE PLEDGE OF 

11032
06:18:35,025 --> 06:18:35,425
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

11033
06:18:35,425 --> 06:18:39,863
THE WORD REITERATES ITS 

11034
06:18:39,863 --> 06:18:40,163
COMMITMENT. 

11035
06:18:40,163 --> 06:18:41,565
NORTH KOREA HAS SAID THIS 

11036
06:18:41,565 --> 06:18:41,798
BEFORE. 

11037
06:18:41,798 --> 06:18:43,867
ARE THEY GOING TO ALLOW 

11038
06:18:43,867 --> 06:18:45,769
INSPECTORS IN TO VERIFY THAT 

11039
06:18:45,769 --> 06:18:47,471
THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY 

11040
06:18:47,471 --> 06:18:48,038
DESTROYED? 

11041
06:18:48,038 --> 06:18:49,005
>>  INDEED. 

11042
06:18:49,005 --> 06:18:51,108
I THINK ONE OF THE MORE 

11043
06:18:51,108 --> 06:18:52,009
SURPRISING THINGS TO COME OUT 

11044
06:18:52,009 --> 06:18:58,015
OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE,  HIS 

11045
06:18:58,015 --> 06:18:59,049
DESIRE TO REMOVE AMERICAN 

11046
06:18:59,049 --> 06:19:00,918
TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA AND HIS 

11047
06:19:00,918 --> 06:19:03,020
WILLINGNESS TO STOP THOSE WAR 

11048
06:19:03,020 --> 06:19:03,487
GAMES. 

11049
06:19:03,487 --> 06:19:05,222
THESE ARE WAR GAMES THAT THE 

11050
06:19:05,222 --> 06:19:07,591
NORTH KOREANS HAVE CALLED 

11051
06:19:07,591 --> 06:19:09,493
PROVOCATIVE AND THAT THE 

11052
06:19:09,493 --> 06:19:10,894
PRESIDENT ALSO CALLED 

11053
06:19:10,894 --> 06:19:12,563
PROVOCATIVE, TODAY, WHICH IS 

11054
06:19:12,563 --> 06:19:13,864
SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM 

11055
06:19:13,864 --> 06:19:15,098
AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT BEFORE. 

11056
06:19:15,098 --> 06:19:17,401
TELL ME THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 

11057
06:19:17,401 --> 06:19:17,601
THAT. 

11058
06:19:17,601 --> 06:19:20,236
>>  Reporter: IT WAS STUNNING. 

11059
06:19:20,236 --> 06:19:21,572
HE BASICALLY ADOPTED NORTH 

11060
06:19:21,572 --> 06:19:23,707
KOREA'S LANGUAGE ON THOSE 

11061
06:19:23,707 --> 06:19:24,174
MILITARY EXERCISES. 

11062
06:19:24,174 --> 06:19:25,409
THE UNITED STATES HAS GONE TO 

11063
06:19:25,409 --> 06:19:27,411
GREAT PAINS OVER A VERY LONG 

11064
06:19:27,411 --> 06:19:29,513
PERIOD OF TIME, DECADES, TO 

11065
06:19:29,513 --> 06:19:30,514
CALL THOSE JOINT MILITARY 

11066
06:19:30,514 --> 06:19:32,049
EXERCISE AND TO STRESS THEY 

11067
06:19:32,049 --> 06:19:33,149
ARE DEFENSIVE IN NATURE. 

11068
06:19:33,149 --> 06:19:34,518
THEY ARE ABOUT MAKING SURE THE 

11069
06:19:34,518 --> 06:19:35,419
AMERICAN TROOPS THAT ARE 

11070
06:19:35,419 --> 06:19:38,222
STATIONED THERE ON THE KOREAEN 

11071
06:19:38,222 --> 06:19:39,723
PENINSULA ARE PREPARED IF NORTH 

11072
06:19:39,723 --> 06:19:41,425
KOREA WERE TO TAKE SOME SORT OF 

11073
06:19:41,425 --> 06:19:43,327
ACTION OR ANOTHER CONFLICT IN 

11074
06:19:43,327 --> 06:19:43,627
THE REGION. 

11075
06:19:43,627 --> 06:19:45,028
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

11076
06:19:45,028 --> 06:19:46,263
STATES TO BASICALLY CALL THEM 

11077
06:19:46,263 --> 06:19:49,099
WAR GAMES AND CALL THEM 

11078
06:19:49,099 --> 06:19:50,467
PROVOCATIVE, THAT'S WHAT NORTH 

11079
06:19:50,467 --> 06:19:51,969
KOREA AND CHINA CALL THEM. 

11080
06:19:51,969 --> 06:19:54,171
FOR HIM TO SAY THEY WILL NO 

11081
06:19:54,171 --> 06:19:55,873
LONGER TAKE PLACE, CAN ONLY BE 

11082
06:19:55,873 --> 06:19:57,207
VIEWED AS A CONCESSION. 

11083
06:19:57,207 --> 06:19:59,109
IT'S A FAIRLY BIG ONE, BECAUSE 

11084
06:19:59,109 --> 06:20:00,843
IT HAS LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. 

11085
06:20:00,843 --> 06:20:02,713
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY HE 

11086
06:20:02,713 --> 06:20:04,815
WOULD LOVE TO BRING ALL THOSE 

11087
06:20:04,815 --> 06:20:05,215
TROOPS HOME. 

11088
06:20:05,215 --> 06:20:06,817
HE DOESN'T SEE WHY WE SHOULD BE 

11089
06:20:06,817 --> 06:20:09,920
SPENDING THE MONEY TO HAVE THEM 

11090
06:20:09,920 --> 06:20:10,153
THERE. 

11091
06:20:10,153 --> 06:20:10,921
TO PROVIDE CONTEXT, THOSE 

11092
06:20:10,921 --> 06:20:12,623
TROOPS AREN'T THERE BECAUSE OF 

11093
06:20:12,623 --> 06:20:12,956
NORTH KOREA. 

11094
06:20:12,956 --> 06:20:14,791
THAT STARTED AT THE END OF THE 

11095
06:20:14,791 --> 06:20:15,124
KOREAEN WAR. 

11096
06:20:15,124 --> 06:20:18,095
THEY ARE THERE AS A BUFFER FOR 

11097
06:20:18,095 --> 06:20:20,163
CHINA, WHICH IS SPREADING THEIR 

11098
06:20:20,163 --> 06:20:22,299
MILITARY POWER IN THE ASIA, 

11099
06:20:22,299 --> 06:20:22,666
PACIFIC REGION. 

11100
06:20:22,666 --> 06:20:24,401
IF THE UNITED STATES PULLS OUT, 

11101
06:20:24,401 --> 06:20:26,003
THAT SEEDS THAT TO CHINA AND 

11102
06:20:26,003 --> 06:20:28,272
THERE IS NO COMPETITION IN THIS 

11103
06:20:28,272 --> 06:20:30,307
SPACE THAT COULD TAKE ON A 

11104
06:20:30,307 --> 06:20:31,708
COUNTRY AS POWERFUL CHINA NOW 

11105
06:20:31,708 --> 06:20:32,209
IS. 

11106
06:20:32,209 --> 06:20:35,112
>>  A GOOD REMINDER THAT THOUGH 

11107
06:20:35,112 --> 06:20:35,812
THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION HAS 

11108
06:20:35,812 --> 06:20:37,981
BEEN ABOUT THE U.S. AND ITS 

11109
06:20:37,981 --> 06:20:39,549
RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH KOREA. 

11110
06:20:39,549 --> 06:20:41,418
THERE ARE OTHER IMPORTANT 

11111
06:20:41,418 --> 06:20:43,220
PLAYERS, SOUTH KOREA, CHINA, 

11112
06:20:43,220 --> 06:20:45,088
JAPAN, AND RUSSIA LOOKING ON. 

11113
06:20:45,088 --> 06:20:47,891
BEN TRACY IN SINGAPORE, THANK 

11114
06:20:47,891 --> 06:20:48,325
YOU SO MUCH. 

11115
06:20:48,325 --> 06:20:50,527
>>> WE WANT TO TURN TO CBS 

11116
06:20:50,527 --> 06:20:52,529
EVENING NEWS ANCHOR, JEFF GLOR. 

11117
06:20:52,529 --> 06:20:54,998
JEFF IS ALSO IN SINGAPORE. 

11118
06:20:54,998 --> 06:20:57,501
JEFF, THIS IS REALLY BEEN A 

11119
06:20:57,501 --> 06:20:58,635
REMARKABLE MOMENT TO WITNESS.

11120
06:20:58,635 --> 06:21:01,271
I DON'T THINK WE CAN SORT OF 

11121
06:21:01,271 --> 06:21:02,539
OVERSTATE THE HISTORIC 

11122
06:21:02,539 --> 06:21:02,972
SIGNIFICANCE HERE. 

11123
06:21:02,972 --> 06:21:04,608
A NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATIONS HAD 

11124
06:21:04,608 --> 06:21:06,944
TRIED TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS 

11125
06:21:06,944 --> 06:21:07,144
WAY. 

11126
06:21:07,144 --> 06:21:09,313
THIS IS THE FURTHEST AN 

11127
06:21:09,313 --> 06:21:10,647
AMERICAN PRESIDENT AND AN 

11128
06:21:10,647 --> 06:21:14,484
AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION HAS 

11129
06:21:14,484 --> 06:21:14,884
GOTTEN SO FAR. 

11130
06:21:14,884 --> 06:21:18,221
>>  Reporter: YEAH, A BIT OF A 

11131
06:21:18,221 --> 06:21:18,822
WHIPLASH HERE. 

11132
06:21:18,822 --> 06:21:21,224
SO, BOTH SHOWS HAVE LEFT TOWN. 

11133
06:21:21,224 --> 06:21:23,793
THEY SWEPT IN QUICKLY. 

11134
06:21:23,793 --> 06:21:27,197
THIS SUMMIT WAS FIVE HOURS 

11135
06:21:27,197 --> 06:21:27,397
LONG. 

11136
06:21:27,397 --> 06:21:28,799
THERE WAS THAT 45 MINUTE 

11137
06:21:28,799 --> 06:21:32,102
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP 

11138
06:21:32,102 --> 06:21:35,005
AND KIM JONG-UN SOLO WITH THE 

11139
06:21:35,005 --> 06:21:35,338
TRANSLATERS. 

11140
06:21:35,338 --> 06:21:37,207
A NUMBER OF HANDSHAKES. 

11141
06:21:37,207 --> 06:21:38,408
THERE WAS A DISCUSSION AT THE 

11142
06:21:38,408 --> 06:21:38,942
TABLE. 

11143
06:21:38,942 --> 06:21:40,210
WE SAW THE SIGNATURES. 

11144
06:21:40,210 --> 06:21:42,446
THAT WAS THE THEATER OF ALL 

11145
06:21:42,446 --> 06:21:42,713
THIS. 

11146
06:21:42,713 --> 06:21:45,315
AND THEN THE SIGNED AGREEMENT. 

11147
06:21:45,315 --> 06:21:47,818
IS SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN IT 

11148
06:21:47,818 --> 06:21:48,385
STRONG? 

11149
06:21:48,385 --> 06:21:48,585
YES. 

11150
06:21:48,585 --> 06:21:50,153
IS IT ALSO VAGUE? 

11151
06:21:50,153 --> 06:21:50,487
YES. 

11152
06:21:50,487 --> 06:21:53,724
SO, I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE 

11153
06:21:53,724 --> 06:21:55,325
PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT, WE 

11154
06:21:55,325 --> 06:21:57,227
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM KIM JONG-UN, 

11155
06:21:57,227 --> 06:21:59,796
OTHER THAN HIM CALLING IT A 

11156
06:21:59,796 --> 06:22:01,398
SCENE FROM A SCIENCE FICTION 

11157
06:22:01,398 --> 06:22:03,266
MOVIE, WHICH TO MANY, IT 

11158
06:22:03,266 --> 06:22:04,301
APPEARED THAT WAY. 

11159
06:22:04,301 --> 06:22:07,204
IT WAS CERTAINLY SURREAL IN 

11160
06:22:07,204 --> 06:22:09,139
MANY WAYS TO WATCH THIS HAPPEN. 

11161
06:22:09,139 --> 06:22:10,540
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

11162
06:22:10,540 --> 06:22:13,343
SAYS IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, 

11163
06:22:13,343 --> 06:22:14,444
THERE'S TALK ABOUT MORE 

11164
06:22:14,444 --> 06:22:17,047
DISCUSSIONS NEXT WEEK AND THEN 

11165
06:22:17,047 --> 06:22:19,616
DOWN THE ROAD, IT'S POTENTIALLY 

11166
06:22:19,616 --> 06:22:22,152
A VISIT FROM KIM JONG-UN TO THE 

11167
06:22:22,152 --> 06:22:23,186
U.S. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE 

11168
06:22:23,186 --> 06:22:24,721
WOULD BE WELCOME AT THE WHITE 

11169
06:22:24,721 --> 06:22:25,155
HOUSE. 

11170
06:22:25,155 --> 06:22:26,323
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT 

11171
06:22:26,323 --> 06:22:28,425
WHETHER HE WOULD GO TO NORTH 

11172
06:22:28,425 --> 06:22:28,658
KOREA. 

11173
06:22:28,658 --> 06:22:30,627
HE SAID YES, AT SOME POINT, HE 

11174
06:22:30,627 --> 06:22:30,860
MIGHT. 

11175
06:22:30,860 --> 06:22:32,262
BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 

11176
06:22:32,262 --> 06:22:32,562
RIGHT AWAY. 

11177
06:22:32,562 --> 06:22:35,699
>>  YOU TALK ABOUT SURREAL AND 

11178
06:22:35,699 --> 06:22:36,800
YOU MENTIONED KIM JONG-UN 

11179
06:22:36,800 --> 06:22:38,034
COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 

11180
06:22:38,034 --> 06:22:39,503
THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN THE TWO 

11181
06:22:39,503 --> 06:22:40,904
MEN WENT TO CHECK OUT THE 

11182
06:22:40,904 --> 06:22:44,741
PRESIDENT'S CAR, LIKE SORT OF 

11183
06:22:44,741 --> 06:22:45,108
BUDDIES ALMOST. 

11184
06:22:45,108 --> 06:22:46,243
SO, MOVING FORWARD THOUGH, THIS 

11185
06:22:46,243 --> 06:22:51,448
IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE 

11186
06:22:51,448 --> 06:22:51,781
CONVERSATION. 

11187
06:22:51,781 --> 06:22:52,849
WE REALLY HAVE SOME VAGUE 

11188
06:22:52,849 --> 06:22:58,522
ASSERTIONS THAT THE TWO LEADERS 

11189
06:22:58,522 --> 06:22:58,755
SIGNED. 

11190
06:22:58,755 --> 06:22:59,189
DETAILS ARE SPARSE. 

11191
06:22:59,189 --> 06:23:00,423
>>  Reporter: YES, SO 

11192
06:23:00,423 --> 06:23:02,058
VERIFYABLE IS THE BIG WORD WHEN 

11193
06:23:02,058 --> 06:23:04,027
IT COMES TO TAKING THE NUCLEAR 

11194
06:23:04,027 --> 06:23:06,630
WEAPONS OUT OF A COUNTRY WHICH 

11195
06:23:06,630 --> 06:23:08,899
IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY 

11196
06:23:08,899 --> 06:23:09,366
COMPLICATED PROCESS. 

11197
06:23:09,366 --> 06:23:10,801
ALSO, HAS DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS 

11198
06:23:10,801 --> 06:23:12,636
DEPENDING ON WHO YOU'RE TALKING 

11199
06:23:12,636 --> 06:23:12,802
TO. 

11200
06:23:12,802 --> 06:23:17,240
SO, THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF  

11201
06:23:17,240 --> 06:23:18,241
THE KEYS HERE. 

11202
06:23:18,241 --> 06:23:20,744
NORTH KOREA WANTS PEACE, 

11203
06:23:20,744 --> 06:23:21,577
RECOGNITION, SOVEREIGNTY. 

11204
06:23:21,577 --> 06:23:24,648
THE U.S.  WANTS 

11205
06:23:24,648 --> 06:23:25,649
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

11206
06:23:25,649 --> 06:23:27,517
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THAT 

11207
06:23:27,517 --> 06:23:28,652
TALKING PROCESS NOW. 

11208
06:23:28,652 --> 06:23:31,054
YES, WAS IT DONE WHEN YOU TALK 

11209
06:23:31,054 --> 06:23:32,589
ABOUT NORMAL DIPLOMATIC TERMS. 

11210
06:23:32,589 --> 06:23:36,026
WAS IT DONE IN AN UPSIDE DOWN 

11211
06:23:36,026 --> 06:23:36,293
PROCESS? 

11212
06:23:36,293 --> 06:23:37,427
YES, THIS HAPPENED VERY 

11213
06:23:37,427 --> 06:23:38,061
QUICKLY. 

11214
06:23:38,061 --> 06:23:39,796
YOU TALK TO THE FOLKS WHO 

11215
06:23:39,796 --> 06:23:41,231
HANDLE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE THIS, 

11216
06:23:41,231 --> 06:23:42,599
OR WHO WATCH NEGOTIATIONS LIKE 

11217
06:23:42,599 --> 06:23:45,535
THIS, AND THEY TALK ABOUT A 

11218
06:23:45,535 --> 06:23:48,305
SUMMIT LIKE THE WHERE YOU KNOW 

11219
06:23:48,305 --> 06:23:50,173
WE JUST SAW HERE WOULD BE A 

11220
06:23:50,173 --> 06:23:51,674
YEAR, TWO YEARS IN THE FUTURE. 

11221
06:23:51,674 --> 06:23:53,810
THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT PLAYED 

11222
06:23:53,810 --> 06:23:54,544
OUT THIS TIME. 

11223
06:23:54,544 --> 06:23:56,146
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T 

11224
06:23:56,146 --> 06:23:56,346
WORK. 

11225
06:23:56,346 --> 06:23:59,850
IT DOES MEAN IN TERMS OF THE 

11226
06:23:59,850 --> 06:24:01,251
NITTY-GRITTY, AND TRYING TO 

11227
06:24:01,251 --> 06:24:02,953
FIGURE ALL THIS OUT RIGHT NOW, 

11228
06:24:02,953 --> 06:24:04,554
THERE IS A LOT TO BE DONE. 

11229
06:24:04,554 --> 06:24:08,458
>>  DEFINITELY. 

11230
06:24:08,458 --> 06:24:10,861
NOT JUST VERIFICATION, BUT ALSO 

11231
06:24:10,861 --> 06:24:11,328
TIME LINE. 

11232
06:24:11,328 --> 06:24:14,131
WE DIDN'T GET A SENSE OF WHAT 

11233
06:24:14,131 --> 06:24:18,001
THE PRESIDENT MEANT BY 

11234
06:24:18,001 --> 06:24:19,302
DENUCLEARIZATION, WOULD HAPPEN 

11235
06:24:19,302 --> 06:24:22,005
QUICKLY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, 

11236
06:24:22,005 --> 06:24:22,706
TAKE SOME TIME. 

11237
06:24:22,706 --> 06:24:24,440
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THE FINISH 

11238
06:24:24,440 --> 06:24:27,277
LINE WILL OCCUR FOR THE 

11239
06:24:27,277 --> 06:24:27,577
PRESIDENT. 

11240
06:24:27,577 --> 06:24:28,945
>>  Reporter: NO, WE DON'T HAVE 

11241
06:24:28,945 --> 06:24:34,116
A TIME LINE ON A LOT OF IT. 

11242
06:24:34,116 --> 06:24:36,353
WHEN THE EXERCISES EXACTLY WILL 

11243
06:24:36,353 --> 06:24:36,953
STOP. 

11244
06:24:36,953 --> 06:24:38,355
WHEN THE NEXT DISCUSSIONS WITH 

11245
06:24:38,355 --> 06:24:41,358
SOUTH KOREA, WITH JAPAN, WITH 

11246
06:24:41,358 --> 06:24:44,361
CHINA, WHEN ALL THAT MIGHT 

11247
06:24:44,361 --> 06:24:44,594
HAPPEN. 

11248
06:24:44,594 --> 06:24:47,797
WHEN THE NEXT MEETING WILL 

11249
06:24:47,797 --> 06:24:48,030
HAPPEN. 

11250
06:24:48,030 --> 06:24:52,102
BUT YES, THE BIG TIMETABLE IS 

11251
06:24:52,102 --> 06:24:52,502
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

11252
06:24:52,502 --> 06:24:53,069
DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. 

11253
06:24:53,069 --> 06:24:54,404
DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A WEEK. 

11254
06:24:54,404 --> 06:24:56,940
COULD IT HAPPEN IN THREE OR 

11255
06:24:56,940 --> 06:24:57,373
FOUR YEARS? 

11256
06:24:57,373 --> 06:24:58,775
SOME SAY IT COULD. 

11257
06:24:58,775 --> 06:25:01,711
OTHERS SAY IT'S MORE OF A 10 TO 

11258
06:25:01,711 --> 06:25:03,112
15 YEARLONG PROCESS. 

11259
06:25:03,112 --> 06:25:05,048
THAT'S A LONG TIME. 

11260
06:25:05,048 --> 06:25:07,651
YOU ARE TALKING 10 TO 15 YEARS, 

11261
06:25:07,651 --> 06:25:10,654
YOU'RE TALKING WELL BEYOND A 

11262
06:25:10,654 --> 06:25:11,121
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 

11263
06:25:11,121 --> 06:25:17,861
EVEN IF HE WINS A SECOND TERM. 

11264
06:25:17,861 --> 06:25:20,230
IF IT CONTINUES ON HERE, BY 

11265
06:25:20,230 --> 06:25:20,964
MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIONS OVER 

11266
06:25:20,964 --> 06:25:21,297
THAT COURSE. 

11267
06:25:21,297 --> 06:25:23,733
>>  CBS EVENING NEWS ANCHOR, 

11268
06:25:23,733 --> 06:25:25,335
JEFF GLOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH 

11269
06:25:25,335 --> 06:25:27,537
FOR TAKING TIME OUT TO TALK TO 

11270
06:25:27,537 --> 06:25:27,703
US. 

11271
06:25:27,703 --> 06:25:31,074
WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 

11272
06:25:31,074 --> 06:25:31,675
REPORTING. 

11273
06:25:31,675 --> 06:25:35,345
WITH ME NOW IS CBS NEWS SENIOR 

11274
06:25:35,345 --> 06:25:37,080
GLOBAL AFFAIRS CONTRIBUTOR, 

11275
06:25:37,080 --> 06:25:37,280
IAN. 

11276
06:25:37,280 --> 06:25:39,149
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO TALK TO 

11277
06:25:39,149 --> 06:25:39,349
YOU. 

11278
06:25:39,349 --> 06:25:41,551
YOU'VE BEEN NECK DEEP IN THIS 

11279
06:25:41,551 --> 06:25:44,987
STUFF FOR YEARS. 

11280
06:25:44,987 --> 06:25:47,257
WE TALKED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, 

11281
06:25:47,257 --> 06:25:47,657
CERTAIN KEYWORDS. 

11282
06:25:47,657 --> 06:25:49,459
AND WE DON'T KNOW THE 

11283
06:25:49,459 --> 06:25:49,960
DEFINITION. 

11284
06:25:49,960 --> 06:25:52,762
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT VERIFICATION 

11285
06:25:52,762 --> 06:25:52,996
MEANS. 

11286
06:25:52,996 --> 06:25:56,099
WE KNOW WHAT IT MEANS  MEANS 

11287
06:25:56,099 --> 06:25:56,766
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

11288
06:25:56,766 --> 06:25:59,536
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS FOR 

11289
06:25:59,536 --> 06:25:59,903
KIM JONG-UN. 

11290
06:25:59,903 --> 06:26:02,138
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO 

11291
06:26:02,138 --> 06:26:04,274
CURTAIL OR SHUT DOWN THESE WAR 

11292
06:26:04,274 --> 06:26:04,507
GAMES. 

11293
06:26:04,507 --> 06:26:06,376
WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN? 

11294
06:26:06,376 --> 06:26:07,978
ABSOLUTELY NO READINESS FOR OUR 

11295
06:26:07,978 --> 06:26:10,313
TROOPS IN THE REGION? 

11296
06:26:10,313 --> 06:26:10,981
DEFINITIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT 

11297
06:26:10,981 --> 06:26:11,181
HERE. 

11298
06:26:11,181 --> 06:26:14,851
>>  I THINK THE SUSPENSION OF 

11299
06:26:14,851 --> 06:26:18,822
BIG JOINT EXERCISE IS SOMETHING 

11300
06:26:18,822 --> 06:26:19,589
WE TALKED ABOUT. 

11301
06:26:19,589 --> 06:26:24,794
NOT ONLY ARE THEY PROVOCATIVE. 

11302
06:26:24,794 --> 06:26:26,062
THAT CLEARLY SOUNDS LIKE A GIVE 

11303
06:26:26,062 --> 06:26:32,736
AWAY TO THE NORTH KOREANS AND 

11304
06:26:32,736 --> 06:26:33,069
THE CHINESE. 

11305
06:26:33,069 --> 06:26:35,138
I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST, 

11306
06:26:35,138 --> 06:26:36,306
CONCRETE THINGS THAT HAPPENED 

11307
06:26:36,306 --> 06:26:37,774
HERE, ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT 

11308
06:26:37,774 --> 06:26:39,776
THEY MET, IS THAT THE CHINESE, 

11309
06:26:39,776 --> 06:26:42,078
FOR A VERY LONG TIME, SAID THE 

11310
06:26:42,078 --> 06:26:45,181
WAY FORWARD WITH PEACE IS THE 

11311
06:26:45,181 --> 06:26:46,750
NORTH KOREAENS SUSPEND THEIR 

11312
06:26:46,750 --> 06:26:47,951
MISSILE AND NUCLEAR TESTING IN 

11313
06:26:47,951 --> 06:26:50,620
RETURN FOR THE AMERICANS 

11314
06:26:50,620 --> 06:26:51,488
FREEZING MILITARY EXERCISES. 

11315
06:26:51,488 --> 06:26:53,022
A FREEZE FOR FREEZE. 

11316
06:26:53,022 --> 06:26:54,658
AND THE AMERICANS, INCLUDING 

11317
06:26:54,658 --> 06:26:57,694
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, SAID 

11318
06:26:57,694 --> 06:26:58,194
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. 

11319
06:26:58,194 --> 06:27:00,329
OBAMA NEVER WANTED TO GO THERE. 

11320
06:27:00,329 --> 06:27:00,529
NOW. 

11321
06:27:00,529 --> 06:27:02,165
>>  WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING 

11322
06:27:02,165 --> 06:27:03,767
TROOPS IF THEY ARE NOT 

11323
06:27:03,767 --> 06:27:05,835
PRACTICED AND READY TO BE 

11324
06:27:05,835 --> 06:27:06,135
DEPLOYED? 

11325
06:27:06,135 --> 06:27:09,439
>>  YOU STILL WANT TROOPS 

11326
06:27:09,439 --> 06:27:09,672
THERE. 

11327
06:27:09,672 --> 06:27:12,375
TE POINT OF HAVING TROOPS, YOU 

11328
06:27:12,375 --> 06:27:13,076
ROTATE THEM OUT. 

11329
06:27:13,076 --> 06:27:15,045
THESE THINGS ARE SIGNIFICANT, 

11330
06:27:15,045 --> 06:27:15,578
AND TRIP WIRE. 

11331
06:27:15,578 --> 06:27:18,181
IN OTHER WORDS, THE CHINESE, 

11332
06:27:18,181 --> 06:27:20,783
THE NORTH KOREANS ARE PREVENTED 

11333
06:27:20,783 --> 06:27:22,185
FROM ENGAGING IN AGGRESSION, 

11334
06:27:22,185 --> 06:27:23,687
BECAUSE IF ANYTHING SPIRALS OUT 

11335
06:27:23,687 --> 06:27:24,820
OF CONTROL, THERE'S AMERICAN 

11336
06:27:24,820 --> 06:27:27,090
MILITARY THAT ARE GOING TO 

11337
06:27:27,090 --> 06:27:29,059
ACTUALLY HAVE THEIR BLOOD 

11338
06:27:29,059 --> 06:27:29,326
SPILLED. 

11339
06:27:29,326 --> 06:27:31,594
THE AMERICANS WOULD HAVE TO 

11340
06:27:31,594 --> 06:27:31,861
ESCALATE. 

11341
06:27:31,861 --> 06:27:34,364
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT, BUT IT'S A 

11342
06:27:34,364 --> 06:27:34,564
GIVE. 

11343
06:27:34,564 --> 06:27:35,732
ANOTHER BIG GIVE IS THE FACT 

11344
06:27:35,732 --> 06:27:38,134
THAT THE UNITED STATES IS NOW 

11345
06:27:38,134 --> 06:27:40,537
PROACTIVELY TALKING ABOUT MAYBE 

11346
06:27:40,537 --> 06:27:43,473
WE DON'T NEED THESE TROOPS IN 

11347
06:27:43,473 --> 06:27:43,806
SOUTH KOREA. 

11348
06:27:43,806 --> 06:27:46,076
30,000 TROOPS, THEY ARE 

11349
06:27:46,076 --> 06:27:46,376
EXPENSIVE. 

11350
06:27:46,376 --> 06:27:47,577
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE OFF 

11351
06:27:47,577 --> 06:27:49,979
SANCTIONS UNTIL THERE IS 

11352
06:27:49,979 --> 06:27:50,379
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

11353
06:27:50,379 --> 06:27:51,981
WE AREN'T GOING TO TAKE THE 

11354
06:27:51,981 --> 06:27:54,584
TROOPS OUT UNTIL THERE'S 

11355
06:27:54,584 --> 06:27:55,085
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

11356
06:27:55,085 --> 06:27:57,287
YOU CAN WORK YOUR WAY DOWN THE 

11357
06:27:57,287 --> 06:27:57,554
PROCESS. 

11358
06:27:57,554 --> 06:27:59,489
IT FELT LIKE IN THE CONCRETE 

11359
06:27:59,489 --> 06:28:00,890
LANGUAGE HERE, TRUMP WAS DOING 

11360
06:28:00,890 --> 06:28:05,462
A LOT MORE GIVING THAN KIM JONG-

11361
06:28:05,462 --> 06:28:06,362
UN ACTUALLY WAS. 

11362
06:28:06,362 --> 06:28:09,833
LOOK, THIS IS CLEARLY A 

11363
06:28:09,833 --> 06:28:10,299
HISTORIC SUMMIT. 

11364
06:28:10,299 --> 06:28:12,368
IT'S A BIG DEAL FOR THE WORLD. 

11365
06:28:12,368 --> 06:28:14,738
YOU AND I WERE SITTING HERE 

11366
06:28:14,738 --> 06:28:18,575
TALKING A FEW MONTHS AGO. 

11367
06:28:18,575 --> 06:28:20,977
IT WAS ONE IN FIVE, ONE IN 

11368
06:28:20,977 --> 06:28:21,878
THREE TWO LIKELIHOOD, WE WERE 

11369
06:28:21,878 --> 06:28:25,181
GOING TO END UP IN A LIKELIHOOD 

11370
06:28:25,181 --> 06:28:27,384
IN THE NEAR TERM IS EFFECTIVELY 

11371
06:28:27,384 --> 06:28:27,684
ZERO. 

11372
06:28:27,684 --> 06:28:29,886
SO THAT'S A BIG WIN. 

11373
06:28:29,886 --> 06:28:30,186
RIGHT? 

11374
06:28:30,186 --> 06:28:33,590
LET'S NOT LOSE  SIGHT OF THAT. 

11375
06:28:33,590 --> 06:28:36,092
IF YOU LOSE OVER THE LONGER 

11376
06:28:36,092 --> 06:28:37,594
TERM, WHAT ASIA IS MORE LIKELY 

11377
06:28:37,594 --> 06:28:39,562
TO LOOK LIKE, IT IS DOMINATED 

11378
06:28:39,562 --> 06:28:40,829
BY THE CHINESE. 

11379
06:28:40,829 --> 06:28:42,365
THAT WAS THE CASE OF THE 

11380
06:28:42,365 --> 06:28:44,066
SUMMIT, BUT THIS SUMMIT AND THE 

11381
06:28:44,066 --> 06:28:45,568
OUTCOME, SORT OF SPED THAT 

11382
06:28:45,568 --> 06:28:46,369
PROCESS ALONG A LITTLE BIT. 

11383
06:28:46,369 --> 06:28:48,538
>>  THE POSSIBILITY OF REMOVING 

11384
06:28:48,538 --> 06:28:51,007
U.S. TROOPS, THAN DEFINITELY. 

11385
06:28:51,007 --> 06:28:52,409
YOU KNOW ONE THING I DIDN'T SEE 

11386
06:28:52,409 --> 06:28:54,611
AND DIDN'T HEAR MUCH OF, THAT 

11387
06:28:54,611 --> 06:28:55,578
THE PRESIDENT PROMISED BEFORE 

11388
06:28:55,578 --> 06:28:57,346
WAS SOME LEVEL OF SECURITY 

11389
06:28:57,346 --> 06:28:59,482
ASSURANCES FOR KIM JONG-UN. 

11390
06:28:59,482 --> 06:29:00,617
THAT DIDN'T COME UP, I DON'T 

11391
06:29:00,617 --> 06:29:00,850
THINK. 

11392
06:29:00,850 --> 06:29:03,586
>>  NO, WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY 

11393
06:29:03,586 --> 06:29:04,888
CONCRETE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT 

11394
06:29:04,888 --> 06:29:06,189
SECURITY ASSURANCES WOULD LOOK 

11395
06:29:06,189 --> 06:29:06,389
LIKE. 

11396
06:29:06,389 --> 06:29:09,492
ASHIED FROM ASIDE FROM THE FACT 

11397
06:29:09,492 --> 06:29:11,761
THAT WE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT 

11398
06:29:11,761 --> 06:29:13,395
PUTTING AN EMBASSY. 

11399
06:29:13,395 --> 06:29:14,263
THAT WAS DISCUSSED. 

11400
06:29:14,263 --> 06:29:16,266
AND WE DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT 

11401
06:29:16,266 --> 06:29:18,768
WE WANT A FORMAL END TO THE 

11402
06:29:18,768 --> 06:29:19,101
KOREAEN WAR. 

11403
06:29:19,101 --> 06:29:20,870
AND ASSUMING WE GET THERE, THAT 

11404
06:29:20,870 --> 06:29:24,607
WOULD BE SOME KIND OF A 

11405
06:29:24,607 --> 06:29:25,074
SYMBOLIC GUARANTEE. 

11406
06:29:25,074 --> 06:29:27,577
BUT LOOK, TRUMP BARELY PREPARED 

11407
06:29:27,577 --> 06:29:28,577
FOR THIS MEETING. 

11408
06:29:28,577 --> 06:29:30,413
SO THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE GOING 

11409
06:29:30,413 --> 06:29:32,282
TO WORK OUT THOSE KINDS OF 

11410
06:29:32,282 --> 06:29:35,485
DETAILS REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE. 

11411
06:29:35,485 --> 06:29:37,487
AND NORTH KOREA WANTED ALL THE 

11412
06:29:37,487 --> 06:29:39,922
TRAPPINGS OF THE SUMMIT, WANTED 

11413
06:29:39,922 --> 06:29:41,691
THE LEGITIMACY THAT COMES WITH 

11414
06:29:41,691 --> 06:29:43,493
THE FLAGS SIDE BY SIDE, BEING 

11415
06:29:43,493 --> 06:29:45,495
SEEN AS AN EQUAL ON THAT STAGE, 

11416
06:29:45,495 --> 06:29:48,164
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING 

11417
06:29:48,164 --> 06:29:48,431
SPECIFIC. 

11418
06:29:48,431 --> 06:29:50,499
I SAW NOTHING FROM THE SUMMIT 

11419
06:29:50,499 --> 06:29:53,069
THAT THE NORTH KOREANS GAVE THE 

11420
06:29:53,069 --> 06:29:54,370
AMERICANS THAT THEY HADN'T 

11421
06:29:54,370 --> 06:29:55,772
ALREADY SAID IN THEIR SUMMIT 

11422
06:29:55,772 --> 06:29:58,775
WITH PRESIDENT MOON OF SOUTH 

11423
06:29:58,775 --> 06:29:59,042
KOREA. 

11424
06:29:59,042 --> 06:29:59,942
THE FIRST SUMMIT. 

11425
06:29:59,942 --> 06:30:01,711
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IS 

11426
06:30:01,711 --> 06:30:03,413
THAT KIM JONG-UN CLEARLY DOES 

11427
06:30:03,413 --> 06:30:05,381
WANT TO REACH OUT. 

11428
06:30:05,381 --> 06:30:10,220
HE'S ENGAGED NOW WITH THE 

11429
06:30:10,220 --> 06:30:11,054
CHINESE. 

11430
06:30:11,054 --> 06:30:12,255
THEY HAD TWO MEETINGS. 

11431
06:30:12,255 --> 06:30:14,123
TWO WARM AND MEANINGFUL SUMMITS 

11432
06:30:14,123 --> 06:30:15,892
WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN 

11433
06:30:15,892 --> 06:30:16,392
PRESIDENT. 

11434
06:30:16,392 --> 06:30:17,861
HE HAD A BREAKTHROUGH SUMMIT 

11435
06:30:17,861 --> 06:30:19,195
WITH THE AMERICANS. 

11436
06:30:19,195 --> 06:30:26,369
HE TRAVELED THERE NEXT WEEK. 

11437
06:30:26,369 --> 06:30:26,903
RELATIVELY SHORT ORDER. 

11438
06:30:26,903 --> 06:30:29,439
BEFORE THE FIRE AND FURY 

11439
06:30:29,439 --> 06:30:30,306
COMMENTS FROM TRUMP. 

11440
06:30:30,306 --> 06:30:34,410
THE ONLY FOREIGN LEADER THAT 

11441
06:30:34,410 --> 06:30:37,614
KIM JONG-UN EVER MET WAS DENNIS 

11442
06:30:37,614 --> 06:30:37,914
RODMAN. 

11443
06:30:37,914 --> 06:30:39,115
SO, WE'VE COME AN AWFUL LONG 

11444
06:30:39,115 --> 06:30:40,917
WAY, AND YOU KNOW, IF WE SAY 

11445
06:30:40,917 --> 06:30:42,519
THAT TRUMP IS THIS LEADER THAT 

11446
06:30:42,519 --> 06:30:44,087
NO ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE GONE 

11447
06:30:44,087 --> 06:30:45,522
HALF WAY AROUND THE WORLD, AND 

11448
06:30:45,522 --> 06:30:47,624
SAID THE KIND OF NICE THINGS 

11449
06:30:47,624 --> 06:30:49,392
ABOUT KIM JONG-UN THAT TRUMP 

11450
06:30:49,392 --> 06:30:50,592
HAS, THERE'S NO NORTH KOREAN 

11451
06:30:50,592 --> 06:30:52,028
LEADER THAT WE'VE SEEN, THAT 

11452
06:30:52,028 --> 06:30:56,933
WOULD HAVE ENGAGED IN THE OPEN 

11453
06:30:56,933 --> 06:30:57,367
DIPLOMACY. 

11454
06:30:57,367 --> 06:30:58,300
TRAVELING TO SINGAPORE, 

11455
06:30:58,300 --> 06:31:00,570
SMILING, ENGAGING, A SELFIE 

11456
06:31:00,570 --> 06:31:01,905
WITH THE SINGAPORE FOREIGN 

11457
06:31:01,905 --> 06:31:03,873
MINISTER, AND TALKING OPENLY 

11458
06:31:03,873 --> 06:31:04,740
ABOUT A MOVIE. 

11459
06:31:04,740 --> 06:31:06,409
HE CLEARLY IS MORE INTERESTED 

11460
06:31:06,409 --> 06:31:08,211
IN PROVIDING SOME ECONOMIC 

11461
06:31:08,211 --> 06:31:09,913
BENEFITS TO HIS PEOPLE THAN 

11462
06:31:09,913 --> 06:31:11,514
PREVIOUS NORTH KOREAN LEADERS 

11463
06:31:11,514 --> 06:31:11,814
HAVE. 

11464
06:31:11,814 --> 06:31:14,217
HAVING SAID THAT, HE'S THE GUY 

11465
06:31:14,217 --> 06:31:15,818
THAT KILLED OTTO, HAVING SAID 

11466
06:31:15,818 --> 06:31:18,621
THAT, HE'S ALSO THE GUY THAT IS 

11467
06:31:18,621 --> 06:31:21,324
LEADING THE WORLD'S LARGEST 

11468
06:31:21,324 --> 06:31:22,157
HUMAN CONCENTRATION CAMP. 

11469
06:31:22,157 --> 06:31:23,726
IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT. 

11470
06:31:23,726 --> 06:31:25,027
HE HAS ABSOLUTELY BEEN 

11471
06:31:25,027 --> 06:31:26,796
NORMALIZED THROUGH THIS 

11472
06:31:26,796 --> 06:31:27,063
PROCESS. 

11473
06:31:27,063 --> 06:31:30,099
>>  WELL, THAT IS THE FOLLOWUP 

11474
06:31:30,099 --> 06:31:30,366
QUESTION. 

11475
06:31:30,366 --> 06:31:32,101
DOES THIS SUMMIT MAKE IT OKAY 

11476
06:31:32,101 --> 06:31:34,504
FOR OTHER LEADERS TO MEET WITH 

11477
06:31:34,504 --> 06:31:34,704
HIM? 

11478
06:31:34,704 --> 06:31:36,472
WE KNOW ASSAD WILL MEET WITH 

11479
06:31:36,472 --> 06:31:37,206
HIM. 

11480
06:31:37,206 --> 06:31:38,474
THAT'S NOTHING STUNNING THERE, 

11481
06:31:38,474 --> 06:31:39,742
BUT, DOES THIS OPEN THE DOOR 

11482
06:31:39,742 --> 06:31:42,312
FOR OTHERS TO REACH OUT AND 

11483
06:31:42,312 --> 06:31:43,212
MAKE CONNECTIONS, DIPLOMATIC 

11484
06:31:43,212 --> 06:31:43,779
AND ECONOMIC CONNECTIONS? 

11485
06:31:43,779 --> 06:31:45,448
>>  I THINK THE MEETING WITH 

11486
06:31:45,448 --> 06:31:47,116
THE SOUTH KOREANS ALREADY DID 

11487
06:31:47,116 --> 06:31:47,317
THAT. 

11488
06:31:47,317 --> 06:31:49,052
THE MORE IMPORTANT POINT IS 

11489
06:31:49,052 --> 06:31:52,522
THAT TRUMP HAVING A VALUES FREE 

11490
06:31:52,522 --> 06:31:54,223
PRESIDENCY, WHERE HE ENGAGES 

11491
06:31:54,223 --> 06:31:55,758
WITH ANYONE, AS LONG AS HE CAN 

11492
06:31:55,758 --> 06:31:57,827
DO A DEAL MEANS THAT EVERY 

11493
06:31:57,827 --> 06:32:00,797
ROGUE STATE IS SOMEONE THAT CAN 

11494
06:32:00,797 --> 06:32:01,197
BE NORMALIZED. 

11495
06:32:01,197 --> 06:32:03,700
HE DOESN'T LIKE CUBA AND IRAN 

11496
06:32:03,700 --> 06:32:06,603
IN PART BECAUSE THOSE WERE 

11497
06:32:06,603 --> 06:32:06,936
OBAMA THINGS. 

11498
06:32:06,936 --> 06:32:08,938
AS OPPOSED TO A TRUMP THING. 

11499
06:32:08,938 --> 06:32:10,106
HE LIKES KIM JONG-UN, BECAUSE 

11500
06:32:10,106 --> 06:32:11,774
THAT'S A TRUMP THING. 

11501
06:32:11,774 --> 06:32:13,142
TRUMP WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MORE 

11502
06:32:13,142 --> 06:32:14,944
LIKELY PRESIDENT TO REACH OUT 

11503
06:32:14,944 --> 06:32:15,344
FOR CUBA. 

11504
06:32:15,344 --> 06:32:16,546
HE WANTED TO DO BUSINESS THERE 

11505
06:32:16,546 --> 06:32:18,047
BEFORE WITH THE TRUMP 

11506
06:32:18,047 --> 06:32:18,380
ORGANIZATION. 

11507
06:32:18,380 --> 06:32:21,818
HE TRIED TO GET IN. 

11508
06:32:21,818 --> 06:32:23,553
IF OBAMA HADN'T REACHED OUT TO 

11509
06:32:23,553 --> 06:32:26,556
CUBA, TRUMP WOULD HAVE TRIED 

11510
06:32:26,556 --> 06:32:26,756
THAT. 

11511
06:32:26,756 --> 06:32:31,260
OBAMA DID, AND WE HAVE TO UNDO 

11512
06:32:31,260 --> 06:32:33,229
EVERYTHING THAT OBAMA DID. 

11513
06:32:33,229 --> 06:32:34,330
SO, AS A CONSEQUENCE, TRUMP'S 

11514
06:32:34,330 --> 06:32:35,264
MOVE IS NORTH KOREA. 

11515
06:32:35,264 --> 06:32:38,267
>>  WHAT ABOUT THIS BUSINESS OF 

11516
06:32:38,267 --> 06:32:39,001
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS? 

11517
06:32:39,001 --> 06:32:40,803
IT CAME UP BRIEFLY, BUT THAT 

11518
06:32:40,803 --> 06:32:43,106
WAS THAT HE MADE A LOT, AND 

11519
06:32:43,106 --> 06:32:43,539
IT'S SIGNIFICANT. 

11520
06:32:43,539 --> 06:32:46,542
HE MADE A LOT OF THE PROMISE TO 

11521
06:32:46,542 --> 06:32:48,277
RETURN THE REMAINS OF FALLEN 

11522
06:32:48,277 --> 06:32:50,046
SOLDIERS IN NORTH KOREA, BUT, 

11523
06:32:50,046 --> 06:32:53,416
YOU KNOW, HUMAN RIGHTS 

11524
06:32:53,416 --> 06:32:56,252
VIOLATIONS, IT'S HUGE. 

11525
06:32:56,252 --> 06:32:57,754
HE CREDITED OTTO'S DEATH AS 

11526
06:32:57,754 --> 06:32:58,554
IMPRISONMENT AND DEATH FOR 

11527
06:32:58,554 --> 06:33:01,157
BEING PART OF THE CATALYST 

11528
06:33:01,157 --> 06:33:03,059
TOWARDS THE SUMMIT, WHICH I 

11529
06:33:03,059 --> 06:33:04,460
SUPPOSE IS GOOD, BUT THE 

11530
06:33:04,460 --> 06:33:05,928
PREFERENCE IS THAT NO ONE WOULD 

11531
06:33:05,928 --> 06:33:09,799
END UP BEHIND BARS IN NORTH 

11532
06:33:09,799 --> 06:33:11,000
KOREA FOR ILLEGITIMATE REASONS 

11533
06:33:11,000 --> 06:33:11,834
AND WIND UP DEAD. 

11534
06:33:11,834 --> 06:33:14,704
>>  IT WAS HARD TO WATCH TRUMP 

11535
06:33:14,704 --> 06:33:15,905
TALK ABOUT OTTO, SAID HE HAD 

11536
06:33:15,905 --> 06:33:17,306
SPOKEN TO THE PARENTS, RIGHT 

11537
06:33:17,306 --> 06:33:18,107
THING TO DO. 

11538
06:33:18,107 --> 06:33:20,243
I THINK HE HANDLED THAT ABOUT 

11539
06:33:20,243 --> 06:33:23,746
AS WELL AS ANY PRESIDENT COULD, 

11540
06:33:23,746 --> 06:33:26,049
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT 

11541
06:33:26,049 --> 06:33:26,482
ACTUALLY HAPPENED. 

11542
06:33:26,482 --> 06:33:28,984
I'M GLAD IT WAS BROUGHT UP. 

11543
06:33:28,984 --> 06:33:29,485
BUT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. 

11544
06:33:29,485 --> 06:33:31,287
>>  BEFORE YOU GO AHEAD. 

11545
06:33:31,287 --> 06:33:33,456
LET'S PLAY THAT SOUND BYTE. 

11546
06:33:33,456 --> 06:33:36,592
IT HAPPENED IN THE WEE HOURS OF 

11547
06:33:36,592 --> 06:33:37,326
THE MORNING. 

11548
06:33:37,326 --> 06:33:39,162
>>  A VERY SPECIAL PERSON AND 

11549
06:33:39,162 --> 06:33:41,030
HE WILL BE FOR A LONG TIME IN 

11550
06:33:41,030 --> 06:33:41,330
MY LIFE. 

11551
06:33:41,330 --> 06:33:44,033
HIS PARENTS ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF 

11552
06:33:44,033 --> 06:33:44,367
MINE. 

11553
06:33:44,367 --> 06:33:47,403
I THINK WITHOUT HIM, THIS WOULD 

11554
06:33:47,403 --> 06:33:48,604
NOT HAVE HAPPENED. 

11555
06:33:48,604 --> 06:33:50,606
SOMETHING HAPPENED FROM THAT 

11556
06:33:50,606 --> 06:33:50,806
DAY. 

11557
06:33:50,806 --> 06:33:52,908
IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING. 

11558
06:33:52,908 --> 06:33:53,576
IT WAS BRUTAL. 

11559
06:33:53,576 --> 06:33:55,478
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE STARTED TO 

11560
06:33:55,478 --> 06:34:00,016
FOCUS ON WHAT WAS GOING ON, 

11561
06:34:00,016 --> 06:34:02,384
INCLUDING NORTH KOREA. 

11562
06:34:02,384 --> 06:34:03,953
I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 

11563
06:34:03,953 --> 06:34:05,455
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN 

11564
06:34:05,455 --> 06:34:05,655
VAIN. 

11565
06:34:05,655 --> 06:34:08,223
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS. 

11566
06:34:08,223 --> 06:34:10,259
SPECIAL YOUNG MAN, AND I HAVE 

11567
06:34:10,259 --> 06:34:13,795
TO SAY, SPECIAL PARENTS. 

11568
06:34:13,795 --> 06:34:14,162
SPECIAL PEOPLE. 

11569
06:34:14,162 --> 06:34:14,863
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN. 

11570
06:34:14,863 --> 06:34:16,933
>>  I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WAS 

11571
06:34:16,933 --> 06:34:18,468
ASKED ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 

11572
06:34:18,468 --> 06:34:20,236
VIOLATIONS AT THE TIME. 

11573
06:34:20,236 --> 06:34:21,637
HI PIVOTED TOWARDS OTTO. 

11574
06:34:21,637 --> 06:34:22,972
YOU KNOW, IT'S TRAGIC WHAT 

11575
06:34:22,972 --> 06:34:23,439
HAPPENED WITH HIM. 

11576
06:34:23,439 --> 06:34:26,976
BUT WE HAVE A WHOLE COUNTRY, 

11577
06:34:26,976 --> 06:34:28,244
NEARLY HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 

11578
06:34:28,244 --> 06:34:30,747
BEHIND BARS IN NORTH KOREA FOR 

11579
06:34:30,747 --> 06:34:31,480
ESSENTIALLY OPPOSING THE 

11580
06:34:31,480 --> 06:34:31,780
GOVERNMENT. 

11581
06:34:31,780 --> 06:34:33,349
>>  LOOK, I MEAN THE DOWNSIDE 

11582
06:34:33,349 --> 06:34:34,851
OF TRYING TO DO ANYTHING WITH 

11583
06:34:34,851 --> 06:34:37,053
THE NORTH KOREANS IS YOU OPEN 

11584
06:34:37,053 --> 06:34:41,157
YOURSELF UP TO ENGAGING, 

11585
06:34:41,157 --> 06:34:42,258
LEGITIMIZING AN INDIVIDUAL AND 

11586
06:34:42,258 --> 06:34:46,062
A REGIME THAT HAS COMMITTED 

11587
06:34:46,062 --> 06:34:47,430
UNSPEAKABLE HUMAN RIGHTS 

11588
06:34:47,430 --> 06:34:47,930
VIOLATIONS. 

11589
06:34:47,930 --> 06:34:49,632
I MEAN, THINGS ARE IMPOSSIBLE 

11590
06:34:49,632 --> 06:34:49,965
TO IMAGINE. 

11591
06:34:49,965 --> 06:34:51,534
LET'S KEEP IN MIND, THE IRANIAN 

11592
06:34:51,534 --> 06:34:55,671
REGIME, WHICH IS NOT REPRESSIVE 

11593
06:34:55,671 --> 06:34:57,706
A NORTH KOREA. 

11594
06:34:57,706 --> 06:34:59,375
BUT IS PRETTY REPRESSIVE, IN 

11595
06:34:59,375 --> 06:35:02,979
TERMS OF TREATMENT OF 

11596
06:35:02,979 --> 06:35:06,382
HOMOSEXUALS AND ATROCITIES 

11597
06:35:06,382 --> 06:35:07,182
AGAINST JOURNALISTS. 

11598
06:35:07,182 --> 06:35:09,251
AMERICANS HAVE BEEN TORTURED. 

11599
06:35:09,251 --> 06:35:10,686
THEY SUPPORT TERRORIST 

11600
06:35:10,686 --> 06:35:11,053
ORGANIZATIONS. 

11601
06:35:11,053 --> 06:35:12,155
WHEN OBAMA WAS WORKING THE 

11602
06:35:12,155 --> 06:35:13,556
NUCLEAR DEAL, THEY WEREN'T 

11603
06:35:13,556 --> 06:35:14,390
WORKING HUMAN RIGHTS. 

11604
06:35:14,390 --> 06:35:18,261
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAD A LIST 

11605
06:35:18,261 --> 06:35:22,832
OF VIOLATORS, BUT THAT DID NOT 

11606
06:35:22,832 --> 06:35:24,333
STOP OBAMA -- THEY WERE HOPING 

11607
06:35:24,333 --> 06:35:25,735
BY DOING THAT EVENTUALLY, THEY 

11608
06:35:25,735 --> 06:35:27,136
COULD MOVE IRAN IN A DIRECTION 

11609
06:35:27,136 --> 06:35:29,238
THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO BE MORE 

11610
06:35:29,238 --> 06:35:31,373
FUNCTIONAL IN A COMMUNITY OF 

11611
06:35:31,373 --> 06:35:31,640
NATIONS. 

11612
06:35:31,640 --> 06:35:33,276
CERTAINLY, IT IS MORE LIKELY 

11613
06:35:33,276 --> 06:35:35,178
THAT BY THE UNITED STATES AND 

11614
06:35:35,178 --> 06:35:38,581
OTHERS ENGAGING NORTH  NORTH 

11615
06:35:38,581 --> 06:35:39,682
KOREA, THEY WILL OPEN UP 

11616
06:35:39,682 --> 06:35:40,783
ECONOMICALLY AND THAT OPENING 

11617
06:35:40,783 --> 06:35:43,286
WILL LEAD TO BETTER QUALITY OF 

11618
06:35:43,286 --> 06:35:43,486
LIFE. 

11619
06:35:43,486 --> 06:35:44,387
BETTER STANDARDS OF LIVING FOR 

11620
06:35:44,387 --> 06:35:46,289
THE TENS AND MILLIONS OF NORTH 

11621
06:35:46,289 --> 06:35:50,159
KOREANS LIVING IN THE MOST 

11622
06:35:50,159 --> 06:35:51,194
REPRESSIVE COUNTRY IN THE 

11623
06:35:51,194 --> 06:35:51,427
WORLD. 

11624
06:35:51,427 --> 06:35:53,563
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WILL 

11625
06:35:53,563 --> 06:35:54,330
CRITICIZE. 

11626
06:35:54,330 --> 06:35:55,231
COMING AFTER THIS SUMMIT, IF 

11627
06:35:55,231 --> 06:35:57,733
YOU LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE ARE 

11628
06:35:57,733 --> 06:36:00,136
SAYING, THE POLARIZATION IS 

11629
06:36:00,136 --> 06:36:01,037
EXTRAORDINARY. 

11630
06:36:01,037 --> 06:36:02,538
FOR MANY, IT IS, THIS IS THE 

11631
06:36:02,538 --> 06:36:06,075
WORST DEAL TRUMP GAVE AWAY THE 

11632
06:36:06,075 --> 06:36:07,843
STORE, HOW COULD HE? 

11633
06:36:07,843 --> 06:36:10,479
OR TRUMP DESERVES A NOBEL PRIZE 

11634
06:36:10,479 --> 06:36:10,947
TODAY. 

11635
06:36:10,947 --> 06:36:12,381
I'VE SEEN THAT, TOO. 

11636
06:36:12,381 --> 06:36:14,684
THOSE ARE SILLY THINGS, BUT 

11637
06:36:14,684 --> 06:36:18,688
THEY REFLECT A COUNTRY, WHICH 

11638
06:36:18,688 --> 06:36:20,056
IS MORE DIVIDED THAN ANY POINT 

11639
06:36:20,056 --> 06:36:20,790
IN MY LIFE. 

11640
06:36:20,790 --> 06:36:22,892
THAT SPEAKS A LOT MORE TO THE 

11641
06:36:22,892 --> 06:36:24,293
REACTIONS THAN I THINK WHAT IS 

11642
06:36:24,293 --> 06:36:25,461
REALLY GOING ON HERE. 

11643
06:36:25,461 --> 06:36:27,095
WHICH IS THAT NORTH KOREA HAS A 

11644
06:36:27,095 --> 06:36:29,065
NEW LEADER AND THEY WANT TO 

11645
06:36:29,065 --> 06:36:30,800
ENGAGE MORE WITH THE REST OF 

11646
06:36:30,800 --> 06:36:31,166
THE WORLD. 

11647
06:36:31,166 --> 06:36:32,435
WE'LL SEE WHERE THAT GETS HIM. 

11648
06:36:32,435 --> 06:36:34,870
>>  DENNIS RODMAN CERTAINLY 

11649
06:36:34,870 --> 06:36:35,171
THINKS SO. 

11650
06:36:35,171 --> 06:36:37,239
>>  DENNIS RODMAN DIDN'T GET 

11651
06:36:37,239 --> 06:36:39,075
HIS SELFIE WITH THE TWO OF 

11652
06:36:39,075 --> 06:36:39,709
THEM. 

11653
06:36:39,709 --> 06:36:40,709
I THINK HE'S VERY DISAPPOINTED. 

11654
06:36:40,709 --> 06:36:42,078
>>  I'M SURE. 

11655
06:36:42,078 --> 06:36:43,312
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

11656
06:36:43,312 --> 06:36:45,581
>>  SO, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ON 

11657
06:36:45,581 --> 06:36:47,416
HIS WAY BACK TO WASHINGTON 

11658
06:36:47,416 --> 06:36:50,386
WHERE HE WILL FACE A LOT OF 

11659
06:36:50,386 --> 06:36:51,287
QUESTIONS FROM LAWMAKERS ON 

11660
06:36:51,287 --> 06:36:51,620
CAPITOL HILL. 

11661
06:36:51,620 --> 06:36:52,488
MARK BRENNAN IS STANDING BY 

11662
06:36:52,488 --> 06:36:54,190
WITH A LOOK AT HOW THE SUMMIT 

11663
06:36:54,190 --> 06:36:57,026
IS PLAYING OUT IN THE NATION'S 

11664
06:36:57,026 --> 06:36:57,493
CAPITAL. 

11665
06:36:57,493 --> 06:36:57,993
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 

11666
06:36:57,993 --> 06:37:02,565
CBS NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 

11667
06:39:57,273 --> 06:39:59,741
>>> THERE YOU HAVE NORTH KOREA. 

11668
06:39:59,741 --> 06:40:05,014
IT'S EVENING THERE, AS YOU CAN 

11669
06:40:05,014 --> 06:40:05,781
TELL. 

11670
06:40:05,781 --> 06:40:07,016
NORTH KOREAN LEADER, KIM JONG-

11671
06:40:07,016 --> 06:40:08,817
UN HAS LEFT SINGAPORE. 

11672
06:40:08,817 --> 06:40:10,119
HE HAS HEADED HOME, AS IS 

11673
06:40:10,119 --> 06:40:12,388
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON AIR FORCE 

11674
06:40:12,388 --> 06:40:13,189
ONE. 

11675
06:40:13,189 --> 06:40:14,490
HEADED BACK FROM THIS 

11676
06:40:14,490 --> 06:40:16,325
UNBELIEVABLE SUMMIT THAT HAS 

11677
06:40:16,325 --> 06:40:19,395
BEEN DESCRIBED AS HISTORIC, 

11678
06:40:19,395 --> 06:40:20,362
SURPRISING, AMAZING. 

11679
06:40:20,362 --> 06:40:21,697
MANY PEOPLE STUNNED BY THE FACT 

11680
06:40:21,697 --> 06:40:25,568
THAT WE HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME 

11681
06:40:25,568 --> 06:40:26,969
IN DECADES, A NORTH KOREAN 

11682
06:40:26,969 --> 06:40:27,870
LEADER MEETING WITH THE 

11683
06:40:27,870 --> 06:40:29,038
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 

11684
06:40:29,038 --> 06:40:31,073
I WANT TO BRING IN FACE THE 

11685
06:40:31,073 --> 06:40:33,309
NATION MODERATOR AND CBS NEWS 

11686
06:40:33,309 --> 06:40:35,411
SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

11687
06:40:35,411 --> 06:40:36,212
CORRESPONDENT, MARGARET BRENNAN 

11688
06:40:36,212 --> 06:40:38,514
TO JUST TALK ABOUT THIS. 

11689
06:40:38,514 --> 06:40:39,081
MARGARET, WE'RE GETTING 

11690
06:40:39,081 --> 06:40:40,515
REACTION FROM SOME OF THE OTHER 

11691
06:40:40,515 --> 06:40:42,718
PLAYERS IN THE REGION, THAT 

11692
06:40:42,718 --> 06:40:45,087
HAVE BEEN OBSERVING THIS. 

11693
06:40:45,087 --> 06:40:46,188
CHINA, JAPAN, RUSSIA, BUT I'M 

11694
06:40:46,188 --> 06:40:48,691
GOING TO READ YOU A STATEMENT 

11695
06:40:48,691 --> 06:40:52,394
FROM THE JAPANESE PRIME 

11696
06:40:52,394 --> 06:40:52,661
MINISTER. 

11697
06:40:52,661 --> 06:40:53,996
HE SAID, THIS IS JUST BEING 

11698
06:40:53,996 --> 06:40:54,263
RELEASED. 

11699
06:40:54,263 --> 06:40:56,131
I WANT TO EXPRESS MY HEARTFELT 

11700
06:40:56,131 --> 06:40:58,567
RESPECT FOR THE EFFORTS AND 

11701
06:40:58,567 --> 06:41:00,368
LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, 

11702
06:41:00,368 --> 06:41:02,872
I SUPPORT THE SUMMIT MEETING 

11703
06:41:02,872 --> 06:41:04,573
TODAY THAT HAS RECONFIRMED 

11704
06:41:04,573 --> 06:41:05,908
CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-UN'S 

11705
06:41:05,908 --> 06:41:07,910
COMMITMENT TO THE COMPLETE 

11706
06:41:07,910 --> 06:41:10,913
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAEN 

11707
06:41:10,913 --> 06:41:12,815
PENINSULA, AS A STEP FORWARD 

11708
06:41:12,815 --> 06:41:14,016
TOWARD THE COMPREHENSIVE 

11709
06:41:14,016 --> 06:41:15,184
RESOLUTIONS OF OUTSTANDING 

11710
06:41:15,184 --> 06:41:16,985
ISSUES OF CONCERN. 

11711
06:41:16,985 --> 06:41:18,020
OUTSTANDING, BECAUSE IT'S NOT 

11712
06:41:18,020 --> 06:41:19,522
THE FIRST TIME NORTH KOREA HAS 

11713
06:41:19,522 --> 06:41:20,455
PROMISED THIS SORT OF THING. 

11714
06:41:20,455 --> 06:41:22,157
>>  RIGHT. 

11715
06:41:22,157 --> 06:41:22,992
AND REITERATING SOMETHING THEY 

11716
06:41:22,992 --> 06:41:24,126
ALREADY PROMISED IN THE PAST TO 

11717
06:41:24,126 --> 06:41:26,896
DO AND THEN CHEATED ON THOSE 

11718
06:41:26,896 --> 06:41:27,296
PAST AGREEMENTS. 

11719
06:41:27,296 --> 06:41:28,197
SO, WHAT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME? 

11720
06:41:28,197 --> 06:41:30,199
IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT THE 

11721
06:41:30,199 --> 06:41:30,532
ENFORCEMENT. 

11722
06:41:30,532 --> 06:41:31,567
IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT THE 

11723
06:41:31,567 --> 06:41:33,369
SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE 

11724
06:41:33,369 --> 06:41:34,770
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, JOHN 

11725
06:41:34,770 --> 06:41:35,971
BOLTON, CAN GET THEM TO WORK 

11726
06:41:35,971 --> 06:41:37,939
OUT IN TERMS OF DETAILS. 

11727
06:41:37,939 --> 06:41:39,375
THEY SAID THERE'S ANOTHER 

11728
06:41:39,375 --> 06:41:40,909
MEETING NEXT WEEK. 

11729
06:41:40,909 --> 06:41:42,911
WE KNOW THAT THE STATE 

11730
06:41:42,911 --> 06:41:43,712
DEPARTMENT TEAM, THERE'S STILL 

11731
06:41:43,712 --> 06:41:45,414
A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. 

11732
06:41:45,414 --> 06:41:47,683
WHAT YOU GOT TODAY WAS A 

11733
06:41:47,683 --> 06:41:48,217
FRAMEWORK. 

11734
06:41:48,217 --> 06:41:48,617
A GENERAL ONE. 

11735
06:41:48,617 --> 06:41:50,185
A PROMISE OF SECURITY 

11736
06:41:50,185 --> 06:41:50,486
GUARANTEES. 

11737
06:41:50,486 --> 06:41:52,922
THE PRESIDENT WOULDN'T SAY WHAT 

11738
06:41:52,922 --> 06:41:54,957
THEY ARE BEYOND THIS PAUSE. %

11739
06:41:54,957 --> 06:41:56,525
IS IT A COMPLETE END? 

11740
06:41:56,525 --> 06:41:58,793
A TEMPORARY HALT IN MILITARY 

11741
06:41:58,793 --> 06:41:59,094
EXERCISES? 

11742
06:41:59,094 --> 06:42:00,496
HE SAID THE TROOPS WILL REMAIN 

11743
06:42:00,496 --> 06:42:01,997
NOW, WHAT HAPPENS IN THE 

11744
06:42:01,997 --> 06:42:02,230
FUTURE. 

11745
06:42:02,230 --> 06:42:04,566
SO, THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL 

11746
06:42:04,566 --> 06:42:06,969
HERE THAT HAS TO STILL BE 

11747
06:42:06,969 --> 06:42:07,670
NEGOTIATED. 

11748
06:42:07,670 --> 06:42:09,171
BUT, TO BE FAIR, IT TOOK TWO 

11749
06:42:09,171 --> 06:42:11,540
YEARS TO GET THE AGREEMENT WITH 

11750
06:42:11,540 --> 06:42:11,740
IRAN. 

11751
06:42:11,740 --> 06:42:14,075
THIS IS A FIRST MEETING. 

11752
06:42:14,075 --> 06:42:16,011
THEY'VE HAD ABOUT SEVEN ONE ON 

11753
06:42:16,011 --> 06:42:18,113
ONES WITH THESE NORTH KOREAN 

11754
06:42:18,113 --> 06:42:21,517
AND U.S. TEAMS OF DIPLOMATS. 

11755
06:42:21,517 --> 06:42:22,785
100 DIFFERENT TECHNICAL 

11756
06:42:22,785 --> 06:42:23,585
ADVISERS WEIGHING IN. 

11757
06:42:23,585 --> 06:42:26,088
WE DON'T KNOW IF NORTH KOREA 

11758
06:42:26,088 --> 06:42:26,922
AGREED TO ANY. 

11759
06:42:26,922 --> 06:42:28,023
THEY HAVEN'T HANDED OVER THAT 

11760
06:42:28,023 --> 06:42:29,157
LIST OF NUCLEAR SITES. 

11761
06:42:29,157 --> 06:42:30,258
>>  RIGHT. 

11762
06:42:30,258 --> 06:42:31,527
AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE LIST 

11763
06:42:31,527 --> 06:42:33,629
THAT THEY WOULD HAND OVER, NOT 

11764
06:42:33,629 --> 06:42:35,231
NECESSARILY THE LIST THAT 

11765
06:42:35,231 --> 06:42:36,498
INTELLIGENCE WOULD SUGGEST 

11766
06:42:36,498 --> 06:42:37,299
SHOULD BE INSPECTED. 

11767
06:42:37,299 --> 06:42:39,602
BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TALK 

11768
06:42:39,602 --> 06:42:41,604
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF 

11769
06:42:41,604 --> 06:42:42,004
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

11770
06:42:42,004 --> 06:42:43,372
ONE THING THAT DIDN'T COME UP 

11771
06:42:43,372 --> 06:42:46,108
WITH THE PRESS CONFERENCE IS 

11772
06:42:46,108 --> 06:42:47,543
THE TIME LINE. 

11773
06:42:47,543 --> 06:42:50,312
AND EXPERTS HAVE INDICATED 

11774
06:42:50,312 --> 06:42:53,281
THERE COULD BE A COUPLE OF 

11775
06:42:53,281 --> 06:42:54,383
YEARS, 15, 20 YEARS. 

11776
06:42:54,383 --> 06:42:55,951
THE PRESIDENT SAID IN THAT 

11777
06:42:55,951 --> 06:42:57,219
PRESS CONFERENCE, IT WOULD 

11778
06:42:57,219 --> 06:42:58,721
HAPPEN QUICKLY, BUT IT WOULD 

11779
06:42:58,721 --> 06:42:59,021
TAKE TIME. 

11780
06:42:59,021 --> 06:43:01,123
WHEN HE WAS PRESSED ON WHAT 

11781
06:43:01,123 --> 06:43:03,325
QUICKLY MEANT, HE DIDN'T GIVE A 

11782
06:43:03,325 --> 06:43:04,827
TIME LINE. 

11783
06:43:04,827 --> 06:43:06,228
AND SO, MOVING FORWARD, AT 

11784
06:43:06,228 --> 06:43:07,196
LEAST THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, 

11785
06:43:07,196 --> 06:43:08,998
WHEN WE TRY TO GAUGE THE 

11786
06:43:08,998 --> 06:43:11,000
SUCCESS OF THIS SUMMIT, WHAT 

11787
06:43:11,000 --> 06:43:12,334
ARE WE LOOKING FOR? 

11788
06:43:12,334 --> 06:43:15,304
>>  WELL, THE PRESIDENT WAS 

11789
06:43:15,304 --> 06:43:16,605
LOOKING FOR THIS GENERAL 

11790
06:43:16,605 --> 06:43:18,940
FRAMEWORK WITH THE DETAILS TO 

11791
06:43:18,940 --> 06:43:19,608
BE NEGOTIATED. 

11792
06:43:19,608 --> 06:43:20,342
HE GOT THAT. 

11793
06:43:20,342 --> 06:43:21,644
WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS SEEM TO 

11794
06:43:21,644 --> 06:43:23,445
BE LOOKING FOR WAS THIS 

11795
06:43:23,445 --> 06:43:23,778
RECOGNITION. 

11796
06:43:23,778 --> 06:43:25,347
THEY DIDN'T GET SANCTIONS 

11797
06:43:25,347 --> 06:43:26,581
RELIEF HERE UP FRONT. 

11798
06:43:26,581 --> 06:43:28,817
THAT IS WHAT THEY REALLY 

11799
06:43:28,817 --> 06:43:29,451
WANTED. 

11800
06:43:29,451 --> 06:43:31,553
BUT THEY GOT THIS PROMISE OF, 

11801
06:43:31,553 --> 06:43:34,523
WELL WE'LL LIFT THEM WHEN YOU 

11802
06:43:34,523 --> 06:43:35,657
DELIVER ON DENUCLEARIZATION. 

11803
06:43:35,657 --> 06:43:39,928
TWO VERY -- STATEMENTS. 

11804
06:43:39,928 --> 06:43:41,797
YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE WITHOUT 

11805
06:43:41,797 --> 06:43:42,230
GETTING SOMETHING. 

11806
06:43:42,230 --> 06:43:44,300
SO FAR, DOESN'T IT APPEAR THE 

11807
06:43:44,300 --> 06:43:45,601
U.S. HAS GOTTEN ANYTHING, OTHER 

11808
06:43:45,601 --> 06:43:46,668
THAN WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID 

11809
06:43:46,668 --> 06:43:48,470
WAS NOT IN THE AGREEMENT, BUT 

11810
06:43:48,470 --> 06:43:49,905
HE BELIEVES NORTH KOREA IS 

11811
06:43:49,905 --> 06:43:51,006
CARRYING OUT THIS DESTRUCTION 

11812
06:43:51,006 --> 06:43:52,707
OF SOME OF THEIR MISSILES. 

11813
06:43:52,707 --> 06:43:56,611
YOU CAN BUILD ANOTHER MISSILE. 

11814
06:43:56,611 --> 06:43:58,279
SO, THE COMPLETE, IRREVERSIBLE 

11815
06:43:58,279 --> 06:43:59,148
VERIFICATION THAT YOU CONTINUE 

11816
06:43:59,148 --> 06:44:00,916
TO HEAR THEM REPEAT, WE HAVEN'T 

11817
06:44:00,916 --> 06:44:01,816
SEEN EVIDENCE OF. 

11818
06:44:01,816 --> 06:44:03,152
IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THEY 

11819
06:44:03,152 --> 06:44:04,586
HAVE GOTTEN WHAT THEY BELIEVE 

11820
06:44:04,586 --> 06:44:06,922
IS THIS FAR AT A LEVEL WITH THE 

11821
06:44:06,922 --> 06:44:08,157
LEADERSHIP THAT THEY HAVE NOT 

11822
06:44:08,157 --> 06:44:10,058
GOTTEN IN THE PAST. 

11823
06:44:10,058 --> 06:44:10,291
RIGHT? 

11824
06:44:10,291 --> 06:44:12,061
SO, THEY BELIEVE IT'S DIFFERENT 

11825
06:44:12,061 --> 06:44:12,361
THIS TIME. 

11826
06:44:12,361 --> 06:44:13,962
BUT THE PRESIDENT TO GIVE HIM 

11827
06:44:13,962 --> 06:44:17,132
HIS CREDIT SAID LOOK, I MAY 

11828
06:44:17,132 --> 06:44:18,834
STAND UP HERE SIX MONTHS FROM 

11829
06:44:18,834 --> 06:44:20,869
NOW AND TELL YOU HE'S WRONG. 

11830
06:44:20,869 --> 06:44:23,339
NOT ONLY TO MEET WITH KIM AGAIN 

11831
06:44:23,339 --> 06:44:24,473
POTENTIALLY, BUT SAY DEAL IS 

11832
06:44:24,473 --> 06:44:24,673
OFF. 

11833
06:44:24,673 --> 06:44:27,142
>>  YOU KNOW, HE INDICATED THE 

11834
06:44:27,142 --> 06:44:28,243
COMPONENTS OF THIS AGREEMENT 

11835
06:44:28,243 --> 06:44:30,445
THAT THEY SIGNED WERE HAMMERED 

11836
06:44:30,445 --> 06:44:32,181
OUT BEFOREHAND, WHICH IS WHAT 

11837
06:44:32,181 --> 06:44:32,914
WE WOULD EXPECT. 

11838
06:44:32,914 --> 06:44:35,416
MOST OF THEM ANYWAYS. 

11839
06:44:35,416 --> 06:44:36,585
WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT WHETHER 

11840
06:44:36,585 --> 06:44:38,920
OR NOT HE TRUSTED KIM JONG-UN, 

11841
06:44:38,920 --> 06:44:40,055
HE REPEATED HE DID. 

11842
06:44:40,055 --> 06:44:41,557
HE SAID THE SAME THING ON THE 

11843
06:44:41,557 --> 06:44:42,758
FLIGHT BACK HOME. 

11844
06:44:42,758 --> 06:44:44,259
WHEN ASKED WHY, HE KIND OF 

11845
06:44:44,259 --> 06:44:46,462
DEFERRED BACK TO HIS GUT, HIS 

11846
06:44:46,462 --> 06:44:47,730
INSTINCT, IT'S SOMETHING THAT 

11847
06:44:47,730 --> 06:44:49,531
OTHER POLITICIANS DON'T DO SO 

11848
06:44:49,531 --> 06:44:49,932
WELL. 

11849
06:44:49,932 --> 06:44:52,300
BUT I'M PRETTY GOOD AT. 

11850
06:44:52,300 --> 06:44:54,837
YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 

11851
06:44:54,837 --> 06:44:55,037
THAT? 

11852
06:44:55,037 --> 06:44:57,639
THIS IS A GUY THAT, YOU KNOW, 

11853
06:44:57,639 --> 06:44:59,575
AS A PRESIDENT, WE KNOW HE 

11854
06:44:59,575 --> 06:45:01,877
VALUES THAT ONE ON ONE, FACE TO 

11855
06:45:01,877 --> 06:45:02,578
FACE CONNECTION. 

11856
06:45:02,578 --> 06:45:05,447
AND HE VALUES READING PEOPLE. 

11857
06:45:05,447 --> 06:45:06,782
IS THAT DANGEROUS AT THIS 

11858
06:45:06,782 --> 06:45:07,015
LEVEL? 

11859
06:45:07,015 --> 06:45:08,851
>>  IT'S A DANGEROUS THING TO 

11860
06:45:08,851 --> 06:45:10,351
SAY, BECAUSE IT CAN SO EASILY 

11861
06:45:10,351 --> 06:45:12,988
COME BACK TO HURT YOU. 

11862
06:45:12,988 --> 06:45:14,757
AS MY COLLEAGUE WAS SAYING, 

11863
06:45:14,757 --> 06:45:15,557
REMEMBER WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH 

11864
06:45:15,557 --> 06:45:16,859
WAS GIVEN SUCH GRIEF FOR 

11865
06:45:16,859 --> 06:45:18,460
SAYING, I LOOKED INTO PUTIN'S 

11866
06:45:18,460 --> 06:45:20,362
EYES AND I SAW HIS SOUL. 

11867
06:45:20,362 --> 06:45:23,865
WE HAVE SEEN WHAT  VLADIMIR 

11868
06:45:23,865 --> 06:45:25,234
PUTIN THINKS OF THE UNITED 

11869
06:45:25,234 --> 06:45:26,935
STATES, AND WHAT HE DOES IN 

11870
06:45:26,935 --> 06:45:29,238
TERMS OF ATTACKS AGAINST THIS 

11871
06:45:29,238 --> 06:45:31,006
COUNTRY, WITH THE CYBER HACKING 

11872
06:45:31,006 --> 06:45:32,407
AND OTHER THINGS. 

11873
06:45:32,407 --> 06:45:34,877
WILL THE PRESIDENT REGRET TO 

11874
06:45:34,877 --> 06:45:38,414
SAY, I TRUST KIM JONG-UN? 

11875
06:45:38,414 --> 06:45:39,114
NO DOUBT. 

11876
06:45:39,114 --> 06:45:40,182
TRUST, BUT VERIFY, THE 

11877
06:45:40,182 --> 06:45:41,483
PRESIDENT SAYING WE WILL 

11878
06:45:41,483 --> 06:45:43,352
VERIFY, BUT HE HASN'T TOLD US 

11879
06:45:43,352 --> 06:45:43,952
EXACTLY HOW YET. 

11880
06:45:43,952 --> 06:45:46,555
WE KNOW THE WISH LIST. 

11881
06:45:46,555 --> 06:45:48,190
THEY WANT TO GET INSPECTORS ON 

11882
06:45:48,190 --> 06:45:49,892
THE GROUND TO ROAM THROUGH 

11883
06:45:49,892 --> 06:45:51,159
THESE SITES, ABOUT 100 OF THEM 

11884
06:45:51,159 --> 06:45:52,927
TO SEE WHAT'S IN THE ARSENAL. 

11885
06:45:52,927 --> 06:45:54,430
WE DID NOT GET THAT TODAY THAT 

11886
06:45:54,430 --> 06:45:55,463
WE KNOW ABOUT. 

11887
06:45:55,463 --> 06:45:56,832
WE DID NOT GET THAT WE KNOW 

11888
06:45:56,832 --> 06:45:58,867
ABOUT, A LIST OF THOSE SUSPECT 

11889
06:45:58,867 --> 06:45:59,835
SITES THAT INTELLIGENCE CAN 

11890
06:45:59,835 --> 06:46:02,103
COMPARE TO WHAT WE THINK THEY 

11891
06:46:02,103 --> 06:46:04,640
ú 

11892
06:46:04,640 --> 06:46:05,173
THEY HAVE. 

11893
06:46:05,173 --> 06:46:06,374
SO, THAT VERIFYING PART OF IT, 

11894
06:46:06,374 --> 06:46:08,377
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO PROVE 

11895
06:46:08,377 --> 06:46:09,844
THAT HE IS TRUSTWORTHY UNTIL WE 

11896
06:46:09,844 --> 06:46:10,145
GET THERE. 

11897
06:46:10,145 --> 06:46:13,382
>>  AND WHAT WE DIDN'T HEAR 

11898
06:46:13,382 --> 06:46:16,084
TALK OF ARE SECURITY 

11899
06:46:16,084 --> 06:46:16,384
ASSURANCES. 

11900
06:46:16,384 --> 06:46:17,486
THAT'S SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT 

11901
06:46:17,486 --> 06:46:19,188
PROMISED KIM JONG-UN IN THE 

11902
06:46:19,188 --> 06:46:19,988
PRESS AVAILABILITIES HE HAD. 

11903
06:46:19,988 --> 06:46:21,857
>>  AND REPORTERS PRESSED THE 

11904
06:46:21,857 --> 06:46:23,792
PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS OFF CAMERA 

11905
06:46:23,792 --> 06:46:25,360
ON AIR FORCE ONE. 

11906
06:46:25,360 --> 06:46:27,763
AN AUDIO RECORDING WAS SHARED 

11907
06:46:27,763 --> 06:46:28,230
WITH RECORDERS. 

11908
06:46:28,230 --> 06:46:29,932
HE SAID I DON'T WANT TO TALK 

11909
06:46:29,932 --> 06:46:30,365
ABOUT THAT. 

11910
06:46:30,365 --> 06:46:31,833
SO, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT 

11911
06:46:31,833 --> 06:46:32,066
MEANS. 

11912
06:46:32,066 --> 06:46:33,235
WE KNOW IN THE PAST, THE 

11913
06:46:33,235 --> 06:46:34,837
PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE SHOULDN'T 

11914
06:46:34,837 --> 06:46:36,271
WORRY ABOUT REGIME CHANGE. 

11915
06:46:36,271 --> 06:46:39,374
IS THAT ENOUGH OF A SECURITY 

11916
06:46:39,374 --> 06:46:39,674
GUARANTEE? 

11917
06:46:39,674 --> 06:46:40,676
IS THAT ECONOMIC SECURITY IN 

11918
06:46:40,676 --> 06:46:41,977
TERMS OF PROMISE OF AIDE? 

11919
06:46:41,977 --> 06:46:43,579
WE KNOW THE U.N. HAS SAID THEY 

11920
06:46:43,579 --> 06:46:46,081
WANTED TO DELIVER ABOUT $100 

11921
06:46:46,081 --> 06:46:46,348
MILLION. 

11922
06:46:46,348 --> 06:46:48,083
THEY ARE TRYING TO RAISE FUNDS 

11923
06:46:48,083 --> 06:46:48,584
FOR THAT. 

11924
06:46:48,584 --> 06:46:50,686
IF IT COMES FROM THE UNITED 

11925
06:46:50,686 --> 06:46:52,287
NATIONS, DOES THAT MAKE IT 

11926
06:46:52,287 --> 06:46:54,690
SOMEHOW NOT COUNT AS AMERICAN 

11927
06:46:54,690 --> 06:46:57,125
AIDE TO NORTH KOREA? 

11928
06:46:57,125 --> 06:46:59,094
THERE IS DIPLOMATIC WIGGLE ROOM 

11929
06:46:59,094 --> 06:47:00,095
HERE THAT NEGOTIATORS HAVE 

11930
06:47:00,095 --> 06:47:03,065
CARVED OUT FOR THEMSELVES ON A 

11931
06:47:03,065 --> 06:47:03,498
FEW FRONTS. 

11932
06:47:03,498 --> 06:47:04,366
SANCTIONS, REMEMBER, WE ALWAYS 

11933
06:47:04,366 --> 06:47:06,268
THINK IN TERMS OF BILATERAL 

11934
06:47:06,268 --> 06:47:08,036
TERMS, THE PRESIDENT LIKES 

11935
06:47:08,036 --> 06:47:09,938
THINKING ABOUT WHAT AMERICA, 

11936
06:47:09,938 --> 06:47:10,939
NORTH KOREA CAN DO. 

11937
06:47:10,939 --> 06:47:13,575
THIS IS A WIN FOR THE GLOBAL, 

11938
06:47:13,575 --> 06:47:14,877
SO MANY SUPPORTERS COMPLAIN 

11939
06:47:14,877 --> 06:47:17,212
ABOUT, BECAUSE THE REASON NORTH 

11940
06:47:17,212 --> 06:47:18,680
KOREA IS ON THE ROPES NOT JUST 

11941
06:47:18,680 --> 06:47:20,682
BECAUSE OF THE U.S., BUT 

11942
06:47:20,682 --> 06:47:21,884
ADVERSARIES AND ALLIES THAT ARE 

11943
06:47:21,884 --> 06:47:24,086
JUST AS WORRIED AS WE WERE AND 

11944
06:47:24,086 --> 06:47:25,520
PUT SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA. 

11945
06:47:25,520 --> 06:47:27,289
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO IN 

11946
06:47:27,289 --> 06:47:29,191
TERMS OF, DOES CHINA GO THROUGH 

11947
06:47:29,191 --> 06:47:31,260
WITH MORE TRADE WITH NORTH 

11948
06:47:31,260 --> 06:47:32,527
KOREA OR RUSSIA? 

11949
06:47:32,527 --> 06:47:34,763
YOU CAN SEE SOME WEAKENING OF 

11950
06:47:34,763 --> 06:47:35,998
THAT LEVERAGE, SOME LEE WAY FOR 

11951
06:47:35,998 --> 06:47:37,666
THEM, EVEN IF THE U.S. DOESN'T 

11952
06:47:37,666 --> 06:47:39,568
PULL BACK ON THOSE SANCTIONS. 

11953
06:47:39,568 --> 06:47:41,570
>>  AND FINALLY, WHAT WASN'T IN 

11954
06:47:41,570 --> 06:47:42,671
THE AGREEMENT, BUT THE 

11955
06:47:42,671 --> 06:47:43,705
PRESIDENT DISCUSSED IT, HAD TO 

11956
06:47:43,705 --> 06:47:45,607
DO WITH HUMAN RIGHTS 

11957
06:47:45,607 --> 06:47:45,907
VIOLATIONS. 

11958
06:47:45,907 --> 06:47:47,109
AND EVEN WITHIN THE PRESS 

11959
06:47:47,109 --> 06:47:48,010
CONFERENCE, THE PRESIDENT SAID 

11960
06:47:48,010 --> 06:47:49,477
IT CAME UP BRIEFLY. 

11961
06:47:49,477 --> 06:47:51,179
IT WAS NOT A PRIORITY FOR HIM 

11962
06:47:51,179 --> 06:47:51,612
DURING THE SUMMIT. 

11963
06:47:51,612 --> 06:47:53,915
>>  WELL, LOOK. 

11964
06:47:53,915 --> 06:47:55,951
IN THESE SUMMITS, AND IT'S TRUE 

11965
06:47:55,951 --> 06:47:56,251
WITH IRAN. 

11966
06:47:56,251 --> 06:47:57,786
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS 

11967
06:47:57,786 --> 06:47:59,221
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS REALLY 

11968
06:47:59,221 --> 06:48:00,889
GIVEN GRIEF ABOUT BY REPORTERS 

11969
06:48:00,889 --> 06:48:02,691
BY MYSELF, BY OTHERS WHO SAID 

11970
06:48:02,691 --> 06:48:05,093
HOW CAN YOU NEGOTIATE WHEN YOU 

11971
06:48:05,093 --> 06:48:08,030
HAVE PRISONERS IN JAIL. 

11972
06:48:08,030 --> 06:48:08,964
AMERICANS IN JAIL. 

11973
06:48:08,964 --> 06:48:11,266
HOW CAN YOU DO THIS WHEN THEY 

11974
06:48:11,266 --> 06:48:13,268
HAVE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN 

11975
06:48:13,268 --> 06:48:13,569
IRAN. 

11976
06:48:13,569 --> 06:48:14,670
WE CAN DISCUSS THIS ONE TOPIC 

11977
06:48:14,670 --> 06:48:16,071
BECAUSE IT IS A NATIONAL 

11978
06:48:16,071 --> 06:48:18,339
SECURITY ISSUE FOR ALL OF US. 

11979
06:48:18,339 --> 06:48:19,808
AMERICA HAS CUT DEALS WITH 

11980
06:48:19,808 --> 06:48:21,910
DICTATORS IN THE PAST, WITH 

11981
06:48:21,910 --> 06:48:24,413
HORRIBLE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES 

11982
06:48:24,413 --> 06:48:25,614
AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THEM 

11983
06:48:25,614 --> 06:48:25,814
AIDE. 

11984
06:48:25,814 --> 06:48:28,116
IT'S ONE OF THOSE UNCOMFORTABLE 

11985
06:48:28,116 --> 06:48:30,285
COME PROMIZES THAT AMERICA 

11986
06:48:30,285 --> 06:48:30,919
CONTINUES TO MAKE. 

11987
06:48:30,919 --> 06:48:32,521
IS IT ON THE SCALE OF WHAT WE 

11988
06:48:32,521 --> 06:48:35,757
ARE SEEING IN NORTH  NORTH 

11989
06:48:35,757 --> 06:48:36,591
KOREA RIGHT NOW? 

11990
06:48:36,591 --> 06:48:37,792
THAT'S UP FOR DEBATE IN TERMS 

11991
06:48:37,792 --> 06:48:42,064
OF WHERE HE RANKS, VERSUS 

11992
06:48:42,064 --> 06:48:43,865
DICTATORS, LIKE BASHAR AL 

11993
06:48:43,865 --> 06:48:44,999
ASSAD, OR OTHERS. 

11994
06:48:44,999 --> 06:48:46,868
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE 

11995
06:48:46,868 --> 06:48:49,571
SHOULD CONTINUE TO ASK ABOUT 

11996
06:48:49,571 --> 06:48:50,905
AND THAT DIPLOMATS WILL PRESS. 

11997
06:48:50,905 --> 06:48:52,708
WHEN YOU GET INTO THE ROOM, AND 

11998
06:48:52,708 --> 06:48:54,009

IT'S A GREAT DAY. 

12128
06:55:48,556 --> 06:55:52,394
>> THAT SUMMIT WAS ON A RESORT 

12129
06:55:52,394 --> 06:55:53,361
ISLAND WHERE UNIVERSAL

SINGAPORE IS LOCATED RIGHT 

12131
06:55:54,329 --> 06:55:54,896
ACROSS THE STREET. 

12132
06:55:54,896 --> 06:55:56,231
>> THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE CLOSED 

12133
06:55:56,231 --> 06:55:58,633
TO THE PRESS, BUT THEY HAVE 

12134
06:55:58,633 --> 06:55:59,968
RELEASED THIS PICTURE, OKAY. 

12135
06:55:59,968 --> 06:56:02,803
THEY ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME.

06:56:02,803 --> 06:56:06,007
WE ARE ON THE BRINK OF WORLD 

12137
06:56:06,007 --> 06:56:06,541
WAR WEEEEEEEEE! 

12138

IT HAPPENED WHILE MANY PEOPLE 

12140
06:56:27,094 --> 06:56:27,729
WERE SLEEPING. 

12141
06:56:27,729 --> 06:56:28,196
>> NOT US. 

12142
06:56:28,196 --> 06:56:30,264
>> WELCOME TO CBS THIS MORNING. 

12143
06:56:30,264 --> 06:56:32,467
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN

06:56:32,467 --> 06:56:33,802

DEAL TO START DENUCLEARIZING 

12147
06:56:40,008 --> 06:56:40,842
THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 

12148
06:56:40,842 --> 06:56:42,811
>> WE ARE VERY PROUD OF WHAT 

12149
06:56:42,811 --> 06:56:44,345
TOOK PLACE TODAY. 

12150
06:56:44,345 --> 06:56:45,980
I THINK OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP 

12151
06:56:45,980 --> 06:56:47,982
WITH NORTH KOREA AND THE KOREAN 

12152
06:56:47,982 --> 06:56:49,651
PENINSULA WILL BE A VERY MUCH 

12153
06:56:49,651 --> 06:56:51,486
DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN IT HAS 

12154
06:56:51,486 --> 06:56:53,188
BEEN IN THE PAST. 

12155
06:56:53,188 --> 06:56:56,458
>> THE TWO LEADERS SIGNED WHAT 

12156
06:56:56,458 --> 06:56:57,826
MR. TRUMP CALLED A

DETAILING WHAT HE SAID WAS A 

12159
06:57:01,529 --> 06:57:01,762

12160
06:57:01,762 --> 06:57:02,530
TO THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. 

12161
06:57:02,530 --> 06:57:04,833
>> IT OFFERS FEW SPECIFICS ON 

12162
06:57:04,833 --> 06:57:07,702
HOW THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL WILL BE 

12163
06:57:07,702 --> 06:57:07,969
REMOVED. 

12164
06:57:07,969 --> 06:57:08,670
THE SUMMIT, WHICH LASTED LESS 

12165
06:57:08,670 --> 06:57:10,505
THAN 5 HOURS WAS THE FIRST WITH 

12166
06:57:10,505 --> 06:57:12,473
A SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT AND A 

12167
06:57:12,473 --> 06:57:13,007
NORTH KOREA LEADER. 

12168
06:57:13,007 --> 06:57:15,243
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID IT 

12169
06:57:15,243 --> 06:57:17,946
WOULD LEAD TO MANY MORE 

12170
06:57:17,946 --> 06:57:19,647

JEFF GLOR IS LEADING OUR 

12174
06:57:24,886 --> 06:57:25,854
COVERAGE FROM SINGAPORE, WHERE 

12175
06:57:25,854 --> 06:57:28,056
THE PRESIDENT LEFT A SHORT TIME 

12176
06:57:28,056 --> 06:57:28,756
AGO. 

12177
06:57:28,756 --> 06:57:29,089
GOOD MORNING. 

12178
06:57:29,089 --> 06:57:30,625
WHAT A DAY. 

12179

SINGAPORE. 

12183
06:57:35,997 --> 06:57:39,868
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE DID 

12184
06:57:39,868 --> 06:57:41,402
EVERYTHING HING -- HE COULD AT 

12185
06:57:41,402 --> 06:57:43,705
THE SUMMIT, AND THAT'S WHY HE 

12186
06:57:43,705 --> 06:57:48,342
IS HEADED BACK EARLIER. 

12187
06:57:48,342 --> 06:57:49,610
THEY AGREED TO DENUCLEARIZATION 

12188
06:57:49,610 --> 06:57:51,813
BUT THEY DID NOT ESTABLISH A 

12189
06:57:51,813 --> 06:57:54,382
TIMETABLE FOR THE GOAL. 

12190
06:57:54,382 --> 06:57:57,051
COULD BE 3-15 YEARS FOLKS SAY 

12191
06:57:57,051 --> 06:57:58,319
FOR DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE 

12192
06:57:58,319 --> 06:57:59,687
PENINSULA IF IT HAPPENS, AND 

12193
06:57:59,687 --> 06:58:03,958
THERE WAS ALSO NO MENTION IN 

12194
06:58:03,958 --> 06:58:06,427
THE AGREEMENT OF HUMANS RIGHTS 

12195
06:58:06,427 --> 06:58:07,829
ABUSES COMMITTED BY THE REGIME, 

12196
06:58:07,829 --> 06:58:10,698
AND HOW THE DEAL WOULD GET DONE 

12197
06:58:10,698 --> 06:58:11,766
THAT SAID, THERE'S A SIGNED 

12198
06:58:11,766 --> 06:58:13,334
DOCUMENTS, AND IT WAS THE FIRST 

12199
06:58:13,334 --> 06:58:14,636
TIME A SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT 

12200
06:58:14,636 --> 06:58:16,304
HAS MET WITH THE LEADER OF 

12201
06:58:16,304 --> 06:58:19,473
NORTH KOREA, AND THERE WERE 

12202
06:58:19,473 --> 06:58:19,873
THESE HANDSHAKES. 

12203
06:58:19,873 --> 06:58:22,143
MAJOR GARRETT IS AT THE SITE OF 

12204
06:58:22,143 --> 06:58:24,078

12206
06:58:25,313 --> 06:58:25,713
FORWARD. 

12207
06:58:25,713 --> 06:58:29,551
MAJOR, GOOD MORNING. 

12208

>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING. 

12209
06:58:33,554 --> 06:58:38,092
IMAGES FOR THIS HOTEL WERE IN 

12210
06:58:38,092 --> 06:58:39,493
EVERY WAY HISTORIC. 

12211
06:58:39,493 --> 06:58:40,595
NORTH KOREA HAS A CHECKERED 

12212
06:58:40,595 --> 06:58:42,230
HISTORY OF LIVING UP TO THE 

12213
06:58:42,230 --> 06:58:43,865
AGREEMENTS MADE WITH THE UNITED 

12214
06:58:43,865 --> 06:58:44,098
STATES. 

12215
06:58:44,098 --> 06:58:46,201
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THERE'S A 

12216
06:58:46,201 --> 06:58:48,136
REAL CHANCE FOR PEACE, 

12217
06:58:48,136 --> 06:58:49,504
DENUCLEARIZATION, AND A BRAND 

12218
06:58:49,504 --> 06:58:50,705
NEW RELATIONSHIP, WHY? 

12219
06:58:50,705 --> 06:58:52,040
THE PRESIDENT NOW TRUSTS KIM 

12220
06:58:52,040 --> 06:58:53,641
JONG-UN, AND HE KNOWS HE WANTS 

12221
06:58:53,641 --> 06:58:56,377
TO MAKE A DEAL. 

12222
06:58:56,377 --> 06:58:58,012
MORE SUMMITS APPEAR INEVITABLE, 

12223
06:58:58,012 --> 06:59:02,984
AND THE PRESIDENT SAID HE IS 

12224
06:59:02,984 --> 06:59:04,619
OPEN TO TRAVELING TO THE 

12225
06:59:04,619 --> 06:59:06,921
CAPITAL IN NORTH KOREA, AND HE 

12226
06:59:06,921 --> 06:59:08,990
WILL INVITE KIM TO THE WHITE 

12227
06:59:08,990 --> 06:59:09,390
HOUSE. 

12228
06:59:09,390 --> 06:59:10,925
>> THE LETTER IS VERY 

12229
06:59:10,925 --> 06:59:11,292
COMPREHENSIVE. 

12230
06:59:11,292 --> 06:59:12,560

PROCESS TO BRING PEACE TO THE 

12233

TWO KOREANS, AND FOR THE NORTH 

12234

PENINSULA. 

12237
06:59:26,274 --> 06:59:28,543
>> IT DOES NOT TALK ABOUT 

12238
06:59:28,543 --> 06:59:29,611
VERIFIABLE OR IRREVERSIBLE, IS 

12239
06:59:29,611 --> 06:59:34,282
THAT A CONCESSION? 

12240
06:59:34,282 --> 06:59:36,651
>> NO, IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT 

12241
06:59:36,651 --> 06:59:38,386
SAYS IT WILL BE GONE. 

12242
06:59:38,386 --> 06:59:40,188
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN BE ANY 

12243
06:59:40,188 --> 06:59:44,358
MORE PLAIN THAN WHAT WE ARE 

12244
06:59:44,358 --> 06:59:44,592
ASKING.

COMPLIANCE. 

12248
06:59:51,198 --> 06:59:52,367
>> IT WILL BE ACHIEVED BY 

12249
06:59:52,367 --> 06:59:53,901
HAVING CERTAIN PEOPLE THERE. 

12250
06:59:53,901 --> 06:59:57,572
>> Reporter: WILL THE PEOPLE BE

06:59:57,572 --> 06:59:58,339
AMERICANS OR INTERNATIONAL. 

12252
06:59:58,339 --> 06:59:59,540
>> COMBINATION OF BOTH. 

12253
06:59:59,540 --> 07:00:01,375
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT, YES. 

12254

KIM JONG-UN SAID IT WAS LIKE A

SCENE FROM A SCIENCE FICTION 

12261
07:00:21,029 --> 07:00:21,429
MOVIE. 

12262
07:00:21,429 --> 07:00:23,131
LAST YEAR'S CHEST THUMPING AND 

12263
07:00:23,131 --> 07:00:26,934
INSULTS BETWEEN THE TWO WERE A 

12264

ONLY, KIM SAID THEY OVERCAME 

12270

THE LEADERS' AIDES, PRESIDENT 

12273
07:00:51,125 --> 07:00:56,397
TRUMP SAID HE WAS CONFIDENT THE 

12274
07:00:56,397 --> 07:00:57,397
TWO WOULD MAKE PROGRESS. 

12275
07:00:57,397 --> 07:01:03,137

12276
07:01:03,137 --> 07:01:03,938
IT WILL BE DONE. 

12277

>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT SAID 

12278
07:01:06,407 --> 07:01:07,709
NORTH KOREA HAS A SIZABLE 

12279
07:01:07,709 --> 07:01:09,610
ARSENAL, AND KIM KNOWS AS MUCH 

12280
07:01:09,610 --> 07:01:11,979
OR MORE ABOUT THE MILITARY THAT 

12281
07:01:11,979 --> 07:01:14,582
SUPERVISES IT, AND NORTH KOREA 

12282
07:01:14,582 --> 07:01:15,817
HAS TAKEN NO AGGRESSIVE STEPS 

12283
07:01:15,817 --> 07:01:17,919
TO DISMANTLE, BUT HE SAID NOW 

12284
07:01:17,919 --> 07:01:19,721
IS THE TIME TO END JOINT 

12285
07:01:19,721 --> 07:01:20,521
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH THE

THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY ARE 

12288
07:01:23,991 --> 07:01:25,059
EXPENSIVE, AND IN THIS 

12289
07:01:25,059 --> 07:01:28,830
ATMOSPHERE OF GOOD WILL HE SAID 

12290
07:01:28,830 --> 07:01:29,697
THEY ARE, QUOTE, INAPPROPRIATE. 

12291

PAST, TAKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS 

12295
07:01:36,270 --> 07:01:38,573
OUT OF NORTH KOREA COULD HAPPEN 

12296
07:01:38,573 --> 07:01:40,241
VERY QUICKLY, AND THIS MORNING 

12297
07:01:40,241 --> 07:01:42,710
HE ACKNOWLEDGED IT COULD TAKE A 

12298
07:01:42,710 --> 07:01:43,010
LONG TIME. 

12299
07:01:43,010 --> 07:01:45,380
BEN TRACEY IS HERE NOW, ALSO IN 

12300
07:01:45,380 --> 07:01:54,422
SINGAPORE, LOOKING AT HOW  -- 

12301
07:01:54,422 --> 07:01:58,025
BEN TRACY IS HERE NOW ALSO IN 

12302
07:01:58,025 --> 07:01:58,926
SINGAPORE, LOOKING AT THE 

12303
07:01:58,926 --> 07:01:59,193
PROCESS. 

12304
07:01:59,193 --> 07:02:00,128
>> Reporter: THE FIRST STEP 

12305
07:02:00,128 --> 07:02:06,334
WOULD BE FINDING OUT WHAT THEY 

12306
07:02:06,334 --> 07:02:09,736
HAVE, AND WHERE THEY HAVE IT. 

12307
07:02:09,736 --> 07:02:10,972
IT'S BELIEVED NORTH KOREA HAS 

12308
07:02:10,972 --> 07:02:13,574
MATERIAL FOR UP TO 30 NUCLEAR 

12309
07:02:13,574 --> 07:02:15,510
WEAPONS, 100 SITES THROUGHOUT 

12310
07:02:15,510 --> 07:02:18,146
THE COUNTRY THAT INSPECTORS 

12311
07:02:18,146 --> 07:02:20,648
WANT TO ACCESS, INCLUDING THE 

12312
07:02:20,648 --> 07:02:21,682
SPRAWLING COMPLEX ABOUT 50 

12313
07:02:21,682 --> 07:02:23,584
MILES FROM THE CAPITAL. 

12314
07:02:23,584 --> 07:02:31,292
IT COVERS NEARLY 3 SQUARE MILES 

12315
07:02:31,292 --> 07:02:32,893
WITH HUNDREDS OF BUILDINGS. 

12316
07:02:32,893 --> 07:02:35,096
>> THE NUMBER ONE THING THE 

12317
07:02:35,096 --> 07:02:38,332
U.S. OFFICIALS WOULD WANT IS TO 

12318
07:02:38,332 --> 07:02:38,799
INSPECT THE WARHEAD. 

12319
07:02:38,799 --> 07:02:41,302
>> Reporter: MELISSA IS AN 

12320
07:02:41,302 --> 07:02:43,671
EXPERT AND SAYS THE WARHEADS 

12321
07:02:43,671 --> 07:02:46,774
WILL REVEAL VALUABLE 

12322
07:02:46,774 --> 07:02:49,043
INFORMATION ABOUT THE DESIGN 

12323
07:02:49,043 --> 07:02:49,376
AND ADVANCE. 

12324
07:02:49,376 --> 07:02:51,445
OF THE PROGRAM. 

12325
07:02:51,445 --> 07:02:53,347
THE U.S. WANTS ALL PARTS 

12326
07:02:53,347 --> 07:02:54,816
DESTROYED, SHIPPED TO A LAB IN 

12327
07:02:54,816 --> 07:02:55,116
TENNESSEE. 

12328
07:02:55,116 --> 07:02:56,584
IT COULD TAKE UP TO 10 YEARS. 

12329
07:02:56,584 --> 07:02:58,019
>> AND THEN YOU TO SEARCH THE 

12330
07:02:58,019 --> 07:03:00,021
REST OF NORTH KOREA TO MAKE 

12331
07:03:00,021 --> 07:03:03,324
SURE THERE WAS NOTHING THEY DID 

12332
07:03:03,324 --> 07:03:03,657
NOT DECLARE. 

12333
07:03:03,657 --> 07:03:05,493
>> Reporter: LAST MONTH NORTH 

12334
07:03:05,493 --> 07:03:07,829
KOREA, CLAIMING TO HAVE 

12335
07:03:07,829 --> 07:03:09,530
DESTROYED THE MAIN NUCLEAR 

12336
07:03:09,530 --> 07:03:12,200
TESTING SITE, BUILT DEEP IN A 

12337
07:03:12,200 --> 07:03:12,633
REMOTE COMPLEX. 

12338
07:03:12,633 --> 07:03:13,768
>> Reporter: IS THE ENTRANCE TO 

12339
07:03:13,768 --> 07:03:15,369
THE NORTH KOREA TEST SITE, 

12340
07:03:15,369 --> 07:03:17,038
WHERE THEY HAVE CONDUCTED FIVE 

12341
07:03:17,038 --> 07:03:19,307
OF THE SIX NUCLEAR TESTS OVER 

12342
07:03:19,307 --> 07:03:21,208
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. 

12343
07:03:21,208 --> 07:03:24,178
WE WERE PART OF THE SMALL GROUP 

12344
07:03:24,178 --> 07:03:25,379
OF JOURNALISTS ALLOWED TO 

12345
07:03:25,379 --> 07:03:27,248
WITNESS WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS 

12346
07:03:27,248 --> 07:03:30,117
SAID WAS A SHOW OF GOOD FAITH. 

12347
07:03:30,117 --> 07:03:32,620
>> THEE ARE ALL JOURNALISTS, NO 

12348
07:03:32,620 --> 07:03:33,754
OUTSIDE EXPERTS VERIFYING WHAT 

12349
07:03:33,754 --> 07:03:37,124
THEY HAVE DONE HERE HAS MADE 

12350
07:03:37,124 --> 07:03:37,557
THE SITE UNUSABLE. 

12351
07:03:37,557 --> 07:03:39,393
>> Reporter: VERIFICATION BY 

12352
07:03:39,393 --> 07:03:40,695
TRAINED EXPERCENTS WILL BE 

12353
07:03:40,695 --> 07:03:42,129
CRUCIAL, AND INSPECTIONS WILL 

12354
07:03:42,129 --> 07:03:44,699
BE NEEDED FOR DECADES TO MAKE 

12355
07:03:44,699 --> 07:03:53,407
SURE NORTH KOREA DOES NOT 

12356
07:03:53,407 --> 07:03:54,842
CHEAT. 

12357
07:03:54,842 --> 07:03:56,544
>> WITH NORTH KOREA, YOU'RE 

12358
07:03:56,544 --> 07:03:57,611
NEVER 100% SURE. 

12359
07:03:57,611 --> 07:03:59,347
>> Reporter: THEY WOULD STILL 

12360
07:03:59,347 --> 07:04:01,482
HAVE PLENTY OF MISSILES AND 

12361
07:04:01,482 --> 07:04:02,617
AMMUNITION THAT COULD DEVASTATE 

12362
07:04:02,617 --> 07:04:09,991
JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA AND THEIR 

12363
07:04:09,991 --> 07:04:17,365
STOCKPILES OF CHEMICAL AND 

12364
07:04:17,365 --> 07:04:17,898
BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS. 

12365
07:04:17,898 --> 07:04:19,233
>> TRUMP-KIM PART ONE HAS LEFT 

12366
07:04:19,233 --> 07:04:21,135
TOWN, AND WE ARE WAITING TO SEE 

12367
07:04:21,135 --> 07:04:23,003
WHAT THE SEQUEL IS. 

12368
07:04:23,003 --> 07:04:23,871
MUCH MORE COVERAGE FROM 

12369
07:04:23,871 --> 07:04:28,376
SINGAPORE IN THE NEXT HOUR. 

12370
07:04:28,376 --> 07:04:30,011
FOR NOW, BACK TO JOHN IN NEW

YORK. 

12372
07:04:30,211 --> 07:04:31,646
>> THANK YOU, JEFF. 

12373
07:04:31,646 --> 07:04:35,416
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HIS  

12374
07:04:35,416 --> 07:04:37,251
MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN WOULD 

12375
07:04:37,251 --> 07:04:38,786
NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE 

12376
07:04:38,786 --> 07:04:40,721
DEATH OF OTTO WARMBIER. 

12377
07:04:40,721 --> 07:04:41,722
THE STUDENT FROM OHIO WAS 

12378
07:04:41,722 --> 07:04:44,958
RELEASED A YEAR AGO TOMORROW. 

12379
07:04:44,958 --> 07:04:46,627
HE WAS DETAINED FOR 17 MONTHS 

12380
07:04:46,627 --> 07:04:48,328
OVER AN ALLEGED THEFT. 

12381
07:04:48,328 --> 07:04:50,464
>> I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 

12382
07:04:50,464 --> 07:04:53,467
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN 

12383
07:04:53,467 --> 07:04:53,667
VAIN. 

12384
07:04:53,667 --> 07:04:56,737
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS, A 

12385
07:04:56,737 --> 07:04:59,006
SPECIAL YOUNG MAN, AND I HAVE 

12386
07:04:59,006 --> 07:05:01,475
TO SAY SPECIAL PARENTS, SPECIAL 

12387
07:05:01,475 --> 07:05:01,708
PEOPLE. 

12388
07:05:01,708 --> 07:05:02,777
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN. 

12389
07:05:02,777 --> 07:05:04,612
HE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH US 

12390
07:05:04,612 --> 07:05:08,015
BEING HERE TODAY. 

12391
07:05:08,015 --> 07:05:13,654
>> THE PRESIDENT HELPED TO 

12392
07:05:13,654 --> 07:05:16,023
SECURE OTTO WARMBIER'S RELEASE. 

12393
07:05:16,023 --> 07:05:17,658
HE DIED A WEEK LATER AFTER 

12394
07:05:17,658 --> 07:05:24,865
BEING IN A COMA. 

12395
07:05:24,865 --> 07:05:26,067

COMING FROM THE PRESIDENT OF 

12397
07:05:27,969 --> 07:05:28,302
SOUTH KOREA. 

12398
07:05:28,302 --> 07:05:29,704
HE SAID HIS COUNTRY WILL, 

12399
07:05:29,704 --> 07:05:32,773
QUOTE, WRITE A NEW HISTORY OF 

12400
07:05:32,773 --> 07:05:34,374
PEACE WITH NORTH KOREA. 

12401
07:05:34,374 --> 07:05:36,944
OTHER PEOPLE IN SOUTH KOREA 

12402
07:05:36,944 --> 07:05:38,613
GATHERED TO WATCH IN PUBLIC 

12403
07:05:38,613 --> 07:05:41,082
SPACES LIKE THE TRAIN STATIONS, 

12404
07:05:41,082 --> 07:05:42,016
AND CHINA'S FOREIGN MINISTER 

12405
07:05:42,016 --> 07:05:45,319
SAID THEY ARE CREATING A NEW 

12406
07:05:45,319 --> 07:05:52,092
HISTORY, AND HIS SPOKESPERSON 

12407

NORTH CAROLINA. 

12409
07:06:01,469 --> 07:06:01,736
-- KOREA. 

12410
07:06:01,736 --> 07:06:06,907
>>> MARGARET BRENNAN IS HERE 

12411
07:06:06,907 --> 07:06:14,215
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

12412
07:06:14,215 --> 07:06:14,582
EURASIA GROUP. 

12413
07:06:14,582 --> 07:06:16,984
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE DID NOT 

12414
07:06:16,984 --> 07:06:18,319
GIVE UP ANYTHING. 

12415
07:06:18,319 --> 07:06:19,754
SOUTH KOREA RESPONDED SAYING WE 

12416
07:06:19,754 --> 07:06:21,188
ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT 

12417
07:06:21,188 --> 07:06:21,956
HE MEANT.  

12418
07:06:21,956 --> 07:06:24,458
IS THIS A BIG CONCESSION? 

12419
07:06:24,458 --> 07:06:25,726
>> IT'S TREMENDOUS. 

12420
07:06:25,726 --> 07:06:27,595
SOUTH KOREA IS OUR PARTNERS, 

12421
07:06:27,595 --> 07:06:28,963
THE ALLIES IN THE EXERCISES, 

12422
07:06:28,963 --> 07:06:32,133
AND THE PENTAGON HAS NOT SAID 

12423
07:06:32,133 --> 07:06:33,367
IS IT A HALT, SUSPENSION, HOW 

12424
07:06:33,367 --> 07:06:34,802
LONG DOES IT LAST? 

12425
07:06:34,802 --> 07:06:35,903
THERE'S SO MANY DETAILS WE 

12426
07:06:35,903 --> 07:06:38,439
DON'T KNOW IN TERMS OF THE 

12427
07:06:38,439 --> 07:06:39,540
SECURITY GUARANTEE THAT IS 

12428
07:06:39,540 --> 07:06:41,075
MENTIONED HERE IN THE 

12429
07:06:41,075 --> 07:06:41,375
STATEMENT. 

12430
07:06:41,375 --> 07:06:43,377
DOES IT GO BEYOND THAT? 

12431
07:06:43,377 --> 07:06:45,613
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ASKED BY 

12432
07:06:45,613 --> 07:06:46,714
REPORTERS THREE TIMES, WHAT 

12433
07:06:46,714 --> 07:06:48,416
ELSE DID YOU PROMISE FOR 

12434
07:06:48,416 --> 07:06:49,250
SECURITY GUARANTEES, AND HE 

12435
07:06:49,250 --> 07:06:51,051
WILL NOT GO INTO IT. 

12436
07:06:51,051 --> 07:06:53,454
IT'S UP TO MIKE POMPEO WHO IS 

12437
07:06:53,454 --> 07:06:55,022
FLYING TO CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA 

12438
07:06:55,022 --> 07:06:57,258
TO EXPLAIN AND WORK OUT THE 

12439
07:06:57,258 --> 07:06:57,525
DETAILS. 

12440
07:06:57,525 --> 07:07:00,795
>> THE UNITED STATES HAS MADE 

12441
07:07:00,795 --> 07:07:01,996
AGREEMENTS IN THE PAST, 1994, 

12442
07:07:01,996 --> 07:07:04,465
2005, 2012, AND THE NORTH 

12443
07:07:04,465 --> 07:07:06,634
KOREANS HAVE A GREAT STRATEGY, 

12444
07:07:06,634 --> 07:07:07,968
STRINGING US ALONG, RINGING OUT 

12445
07:07:07,968 --> 07:07:09,070
NEW ECONOMIC STUFF, AND THEN 

12446
07:07:09,070 --> 07:07:11,172
IT'S JUST TALK, AND THEY 

12447
07:07:11,172 --> 07:07:12,840
CONTINUE THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS 

12448
07:07:12,840 --> 07:07:13,140
PROGRAM. 

12449
07:07:13,140 --> 07:07:14,408
WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE THEM NOW? 

12450
07:07:14,408 --> 07:07:17,011
>> WE SHOULD NOT BELIEVE THEM. 

12451
07:07:17,011 --> 07:07:18,179
IT'S SURPRISING TO HEAR TRUMP 

12452
07:07:18,179 --> 07:07:20,981
SAY I TRUST THE GUY. 

12453
07:07:20,981 --> 07:07:22,816
IT'S A STRONGER FORMULATION 

12454
07:07:22,816 --> 07:07:25,986
THAN BUSH LOOKING INTO PUTIN'S 

12455
07:07:25,986 --> 07:07:28,789
EYES AND SAYING I SAW HIS SOUL, 

12456
07:07:28,789 --> 07:07:31,959
BUT KIM JONG-UN IS FOCUSING ON 

12457
07:07:31,959 --> 07:07:32,860
THE ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT, AND 

12458
07:07:32,860 --> 07:07:35,830
THE OPENNESS WITH SOUTH KOREA 

12459
07:07:35,830 --> 07:07:37,565
WITH A SUMMIT TWICE NOW, AND 

12460
07:07:37,565 --> 07:07:40,835
ONCE WITH RUSSIA, AND NOW 

12461
07:07:40,835 --> 07:07:42,069
TRUMP, AND THAT IS THE STORY, 

12462
07:07:42,069 --> 07:07:43,304
AND NORTH KOREA IS OPENING UP, 

12463
07:07:43,304 --> 07:07:45,906
AND TRUMP IS A PIECE OF IT. 

12464
07:07:45,906 --> 07:07:48,075
LET'S KEEP IN MIND. 

12465
07:07:48,075 --> 07:07:50,577
WE HAVE A FREEZE FOR FREEZE. 

12466
07:07:50,577 --> 07:07:52,213
NORTH KOREA IS FREEZING THEIR 

12467
07:07:52,213 --> 07:07:55,249
ICBM AND NUCLEAR TESTS, AND THE 

12468
07:07:55,249 --> 07:07:58,052
AMERICANS ARE FREEZING OUR 

12469
07:07:58,052 --> 07:07:59,253
MILITARY EXERCISE WITH THE 

12470
07:07:59,253 --> 07:08:00,153
SOUTH KOREANS. 

12471
07:08:00,153 --> 07:08:01,989
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE ASKED 

12472
07:08:01,989 --> 07:08:04,558
FOR, AND WE SAID ABSOLUTELY 

12473
07:08:04,558 --> 07:08:04,758
NOT. 

12474
07:08:04,758 --> 07:08:09,663
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT 

12475
07:08:09,663 --> 07:08:10,063
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

12476
07:08:10,063 --> 07:08:11,031
IN THE AGREEMENT, IT'S A 

12477
07:08:11,031 --> 07:08:12,399
REAFFIRMATION OF POINT NUMBER 

12478
07:08:12,399 --> 07:08:16,137
THREE, THE PREVIOUS PROMISE THE 

12479
07:08:16,137 --> 07:08:17,738
NORTH KOREANS MADE, TO WORK 

12480
07:08:17,738 --> 07:08:19,540
TOWARDS THE CRUCIAL -- WORK 

12481
07:08:19,540 --> 07:08:21,776
WORKING TOWARDS, AS OPPOSED TO 

12482
07:08:21,776 --> 07:08:22,109
AGREEING TO. 

12483
07:08:22,109 --> 07:08:24,278
WHAT WAS AGREED TO HERE THAT 

12484
07:08:24,278 --> 07:08:26,247
NORTH KOREANS HAVE NOT 

12485
07:08:26,247 --> 07:08:27,181
PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO ON NUCS. 

12486
07:08:27,181 --> 07:08:29,016
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T 

12487
07:08:29,016 --> 07:08:29,216
KNOW. 

12488
07:08:29,216 --> 07:08:30,417
THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY ARE 

12489
07:08:30,417 --> 07:08:33,154
STARTING TO BREAK APART OF 

12490
07:08:33,154 --> 07:08:35,055
THEIR MISSILES, PART OF THE 

12491
07:08:35,055 --> 07:08:40,161
IRREVERSIBLE STEP HE WANTED TO 

12492
07:08:40,161 --> 07:08:40,361
SEE. 

12493
07:08:40,361 --> 07:08:41,562
MIKE POMPEO IS FLYING TO 

12494
07:08:41,562 --> 07:08:42,897
EXPLAIN TO THE NATIONS WHAT 

12495
07:08:42,897 --> 07:08:44,598
HAPPENED IN THE ROOM, BUT HE 

12496
07:08:44,598 --> 07:08:45,999
HAS TO BRIEF CONGRESS. 

12497
07:08:45,999 --> 07:08:50,571
ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS F 

12498
07:08:50,571 --> 07:08:56,510
YOU TAKE A  -- IF YOU TAKE A 

12499
07:08:56,510 --> 07:08:58,846
STEP BACK, IT TOOK 2 YEARS FOR 

12500
07:08:58,846 --> 07:09:09,223
IRAN TO HALT THEIR PROGRAM, AND 

12501
07:09:09,223 --> 07:09:12,793
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY LEVELS 

12502
07:09:12,793 --> 07:09:14,394
LIKE NORTH KOREA. 

12503
07:09:14,394 --> 07:09:17,565
MIKE POMPEO SET HOLY HELL OVER 

12504
07:09:17,565 --> 07:09:17,898
THAT DEAL. 

12505
07:09:17,898 --> 07:09:18,966
WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT AMERICA 

12506
07:09:18,966 --> 07:09:20,301
WANTS, BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF 

12507
07:09:20,301 --> 07:09:22,536
THAT'S WHAT WAS AGREED TO IN 

12508
07:09:22,536 --> 07:09:22,803
THE ROOM. 

12509
07:09:22,803 --> 07:09:25,239
WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT JOHN BOLTON 

12510
07:09:25,239 --> 07:09:26,673
SAID, HE WANTS AMERICAN 

12511
07:09:26,673 --> 07:09:29,210
INSPECTORS TO TAKE THE LEAD TO 

12512
07:09:29,210 --> 07:09:30,611
BREAK APART THE WEAPONS SO THEY 

12513
07:09:30,611 --> 07:09:31,745
DON'T CHEAT LIKE IN THE PAST. 

12514
07:09:31,745 --> 07:09:33,113
>> WHAT STOOD OUT TO BOTH OF 

12515
07:09:33,113 --> 07:09:34,882
YOU IN THE AGREEMENT WE HAVE 

12516
07:09:34,882 --> 07:09:35,249
REACHED TODAY? 

12517
07:09:35,249 --> 07:09:37,117
IS THERE A WIN FOR BOTH SIDES? 

12518
07:09:37,117 --> 07:09:38,886
>> I THINK WHAT THE BIGGEST WIN 

12519
07:09:38,886 --> 07:09:42,656
IS THAT 6 MONTHS AGO, WE WERE 

12520
07:09:42,656 --> 07:09:44,258
TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY 

12521
07:09:44,258 --> 07:09:49,997
OF MILITARY PREEMPTION AGAINST 

12522
07:09:49,997 --> 07:09:50,330
NORTH KOREA. 

12523
07:09:50,330 --> 07:09:50,898
IT'S ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE 

12524
07:09:50,898 --> 07:09:52,433
THERE'S A SHORT-TERM RISK OF 

12525
07:09:52,433 --> 07:09:52,700
CONFLICT. 

12526
07:09:52,700 --> 07:09:54,235
THAT'S A WIN FOR THE PEOPLE OF 

12527
07:09:54,235 --> 07:09:56,003
NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA, 

12528
07:09:56,003 --> 07:09:57,204
FIRST OF ALL. 

12529
07:09:57,204 --> 07:09:59,006
PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT THE CHINESE 

12530
07:09:59,006 --> 07:10:00,908
TO SQUEEZE HARDER ON SANCTIONS, 

12531
07:10:00,908 --> 07:10:05,246
AND NORTH KOREANS CAME TO THE 

12532
07:10:05,246 --> 07:10:05,479
TABLE. 

12533
07:10:05,479 --> 07:10:07,314
BEFORE THAT, THE ONLY FOREIGNER 

12534
07:10:07,314 --> 07:10:12,953
KIM JONG-UN HAD MET WITH WAS 

12535
07:10:12,953 --> 07:10:13,320
DENNIS RODMAN. 

12536
07:10:13,320 --> 07:10:14,822
AS MARGARET SUGGESTED, IT'S 

12537
07:10:14,822 --> 07:10:17,024
HARD TO GO FROM HERE TO 

12538
07:10:17,024 --> 07:10:18,893
DENUCLEARIZATION, AND NORTH 

12539
07:10:18,893 --> 07:10:20,427
KOREANS DIDN'T TAKE ANY 

12540
07:10:20,427 --> 07:10:22,096
CONCRETE STEP TOWARDS THAT 

12541
07:10:22,096 --> 07:10:22,563
YESTERDAY. 

12542
07:10:22,563 --> 07:10:24,798
>> ONE THING THE PRESIDENT 

12543
07:10:24,798 --> 07:10:26,300
DANGLED WAS THE REMOVING OF 

12544
07:10:26,300 --> 07:10:29,837
30,000 TROOPS WHO HAVE BEEN IN 

12545
07:10:29,837 --> 07:10:30,671
THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 

12546
07:10:30,671 --> 07:10:34,041
I LIVED THERE AS A KID. 

12547
07:10:34,041 --> 07:10:35,376
IT'S A LONG-TIME COMMITMENT TO 

12548
07:10:35,376 --> 07:10:38,579
THE AREA IT DOES NOT JUST 

12549
07:10:38,579 --> 07:10:41,882
AFFECT THE KOREAN PENINSULA, IT 

12550
07:10:41,882 --> 07:10:44,451
AFFECTS THE MILITARY POSTURE IN 

12551
07:10:44,451 --> 07:10:44,651
ASIA. 

12552
07:10:44,651 --> 07:10:47,287
ISN'T THAT WHAT CHINA WANTS? 

12553
07:10:47,287 --> 07:10:48,622
>> NOT ONLY WHAT IAN 

12554
07:10:48,622 --> 07:10:50,190
HIGHLIGHTED THERE, THIS IS WHAT 

12555
07:10:50,190 --> 07:10:50,523
CHINA WANTS. 

12556
07:10:50,523 --> 07:10:51,992
NORTH KOREA IS NOT THE ONLY 

12557
07:10:51,992 --> 07:10:57,631
FLASH POINT IN ASIA, AS YOU 

12558
07:10:57,631 --> 07:10:58,699
POINT OUT. 

12559
07:10:58,699 --> 07:11:01,268
-- CLASH POINT IN ASIA, AS YOU 

12560
07:11:01,268 --> 07:11:01,635
POINT OUT. 

12561
07:11:01,635 --> 07:11:04,104
AND SOUTH KOREA WAS LOOKING FOR 

12562
07:11:04,104 --> 07:11:06,073
AN OFFRAMP, CONCERNED OVER THE 

12563
07:11:06,073 --> 07:11:07,608
MILITARY TENSIONS, AND HE 

12564
07:11:07,608 --> 07:11:11,679
DELIVERED, PULLING OFF THE COUP 

12565
07:11:11,679 --> 07:11:14,315
OF GETTING THE OFFICERS INTO 

12566
07:11:14,315 --> 07:11:17,051
THE OVAL OFFICERS TO BRIEF THE 

12567
07:11:17,051 --> 07:11:17,351
PRESIDENT. 

12568
07:11:17,351 --> 07:11:19,987
THE PRESIDENT SAID I HAVE HAD A 

12569
07:11:19,987 --> 07:11:21,021
RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG-UN 

12570
07:11:21,021 --> 07:11:22,389
FOR 90 DAYS. 

12571
07:11:22,389 --> 07:11:24,024
HE HAS NOT SAID IF HE SPOKE TO 

12572
07:11:24,024 --> 07:11:24,491
HIM BEFORE. 

12573
07:11:24,491 --> 07:11:26,427
>> YOU THINK THEY TALKED ON THE 

12574
07:11:26,427 --> 07:11:26,660
PHONE? 

12575
07:11:26,660 --> 07:11:29,063
>> THAT SEEMS WHAT HE MAY BE 

12576
07:11:29,063 --> 07:11:31,398
DANCING AROUND THERE. 

12577
07:11:31,398 --> 07:11:33,734
A RELATIONSHIP FOR 90 DAYS. 

12578
07:11:33,734 --> 07:11:35,669
THAT'S WHEN HE SAID I TRUST 

12579
07:11:35,669 --> 07:11:35,869
HIM. 

12580
07:11:35,869 --> 07:11:37,104
>> WHAT ABOUT THE PERSONAL 

12581
07:11:37,104 --> 07:11:38,706
CHEMISTRY WITH THE TWO THEY 

12582
07:11:38,706 --> 07:11:41,108
BOTH SEEMED TO ENJOY THE PHOTO 

12583
07:11:41,108 --> 07:11:43,510
OP, THE WAY THEY TOUCHED EACH 

12584
07:11:43,510 --> 07:11:45,679
OTHER, SMILED AT EACH OTHER, 

12585
07:11:45,679 --> 07:11:46,914
GOING FROM PERSONAL NAME 

12586
07:11:46,914 --> 07:11:48,415
CALLING NOT SO LONG AGO. 

12587
07:11:48,415 --> 07:11:51,051
>> YOU REMEMBER THE WAY THE 

12588
07:11:51,051 --> 07:11:52,486
NORTH KOREAN LEADER, HIS FATHER 

12589
07:11:52,486 --> 07:11:56,090
WAS PORTRAYED FROM TEAM 

12590
07:11:56,090 --> 07:11:57,924
AMERICA, I'M SO LONELY. 

12591
07:11:57,924 --> 07:12:13,440
TRUMP AND KIM ARE LEADERS WHO 

12592
07:12:13,440 --> 07:12:16,009
CLEARLY REALLY WANT MORE. 

12593
07:12:16,009 --> 07:12:17,778
THE WAY SYRIA DEFINED THE OBAMA 

12594
07:12:17,778 --> 07:12:19,847
ADMINISTRATION, THAT'S WHAT WE 

12595
07:12:19,847 --> 07:12:21,948
ARE SEEING HERE, CHINA IS THE 

12596
07:12:21,948 --> 07:12:22,415
BIG WINNER. 

12597
07:12:22,415 --> 07:12:24,184
>> THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH IN 

12598
07:12:24,184 --> 07:12:25,519
NEXT HOUR WE WILL TALK TO 

12599
07:12:25,519 --> 07:12:26,754
LINDSEY GRAHAM ABOUT THE SUMMIT 

12600
07:12:26,754 --> 07:12:28,022
AND HOW THE PRESIDENT CAN GET 

12601
07:12:28,022 --> 07:12:29,322
NORTH KOREA TO FOLLOW THROUGH. 

12602
07:12:29,322 --> 07:12:31,258
>>> WE HAVE MUCH MORE NEWS 

12603
07:12:31,258 --> 07:12:32,826
AHEAD THIS MORNING, INCLUDING 

12604
07:12:32,826 --> 07:12:34,261
TWO POPULAR SUVs THAT DID NOT 

12605
07:12:34,261 --> 07:12:36,296
SCORE WELL ON THE NEWEST CRASH 

12606
07:12:36,296 --> 07:12:37,131
TESTS. 

12607
07:12:37,131 --> 07:12:40,234
INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW 

12608
07:12:40,234 --> 07:12:40,467
AHEAD. 

12609
07:12:40,467 --> 07:12:41,068
WHY THE INSURANCE INSTITUTION 

12610
07:12:41,068 --> 07:12:44,605
FOR HIGHWAY SAFETY SAYS YOU MAY 

12611
07:12:44,605 --> 07:12:47,408
WANT TO THINK TWICE ABOUT THE 

12612
07:12:47,408 --> 07:12:48,342
FORD EXPLORER AND JEEP GRAND 

12613
07:12:48,342 --> 07:12:48,842
CHEROKEE. 

12614
07:16:11,445 --> 07:16:13,547
>>> THE SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE WAS 

12615
07:16:13,547 --> 07:16:14,715
KICKED OFF WITH THIS HISTORIC 

12616
07:16:14,715 --> 07:16:17,918
MOMENT, THE FIRST TIME A U.S. 

12617
07:16:17,918 --> 07:16:24,391
PRESIDENT HAS EVER MET, IN 

12618
07:16:24,391 --> 07:16:31,031
PERSON, WITH A NORTH KOREAN 

12619
07:16:31,031 --> 07:16:31,298
DICTATOR. 

12620
07:16:31,298 --> 07:16:32,199
THE FLAGS WERE SIDE-BY-SIDE, 

12621
07:16:32,199 --> 07:16:33,467
HAPPENING JUST AFTER 9:00 

12622
07:16:33,467 --> 07:16:35,002
EASTERN STANDARD TIME LAST 

12623
07:16:35,002 --> 07:16:37,604
NIGHT, BEFORE THEY SAT DOWN FOR 

12624
07:16:37,604 --> 07:16:39,206
EXTENSIVE TALKS, AND YOU KNOW, 

12625
07:16:39,206 --> 07:16:41,008
AS WE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT 

12626
07:16:41,008 --> 07:16:42,242
NORTH KOREA AND THE HERMIT 

12627
07:16:42,242 --> 07:16:44,111
KINGDOM IN THE PAST, ONE OF THE 

12628
07:16:44,111 --> 07:16:45,045
THINGS THAT HAPPENED LAST 

12629
07:16:45,045 --> 07:16:46,580
NIGHT, WE HEARD FOR THE FIRST 

12630
07:16:46,580 --> 07:16:48,215
TIME THE VOICE OF KIM JONG-UN. 

12631
07:16:48,215 --> 07:16:48,348
LISTEN. 

12632
07:16:52,886 --> 07:16:54,387
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY 

12633
07:16:54,387 --> 07:16:54,955
SOMETHING? 

12634
07:17:06,299 --> 07:17:12,039
>> NOW, IT'S BEEN 30 YEARS 

12635
07:17:12,039 --> 07:17:15,042
SINCE I LIVED IN KOREA, SO I 

12636
07:17:15,042 --> 07:17:15,475
CAN'T TRANSLATE. 

12637
07:17:15,475 --> 07:17:17,710
HE IS YOUNG WITH A DEEP VOICE. 

12638
07:17:17,710 --> 07:17:19,179
HE SMOKES A LOT OF CIGARETTES. 

12639
07:17:19,179 --> 07:17:20,714
>> HE SAID IT TOOK AWHILE TO 

12640
07:17:20,714 --> 07:17:23,116
GET HERE, AND I HAPPENED TO SEE 

12641
07:17:23,116 --> 07:17:24,184
DENNIS RODMAN LAST NIGHT, AND 

12642
07:17:24,184 --> 07:17:25,786
HE'S PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE ON 

12643
07:17:25,786 --> 07:17:27,888
THE PLANET WHO KNOWS BOTH OF 

12644

DOES HE SPEAK ENGLISH HE SAID 

12646
07:17:32,025 --> 07:17:33,660
WELL, AND HE DIDN'T ASK IT 

12647
07:17:33,660 --> 07:17:35,862
OUTRIGHT, AND HE SAID WHEN IT 

12648

COMES TO BASKETBALL, HE CAN 

12649
07:17:38,198 --> 07:17:38,731

NORTH KOREA HAS NUCLEAR 

12666
07:18:10,330 --> 07:18:12,132

12682

KOREA WILL RETURN THE REMAINS 

12690
07:18:53,106 --> 07:18:56,176

12691

THOSE MISSING IN ACTION DURING 

12692

12694

THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS 

12704

SUING TO BLOCK THE DEAL, 

12705
07:19:18,298 --> 07:19:20,967

12710
07:19:27,441 --> 07:19:29,609
INCREASING COSTS FOR CONSUMERS. 

12711
