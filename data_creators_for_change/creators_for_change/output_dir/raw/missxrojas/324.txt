20
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,320
announced between penguin and Random

27
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,140
bought lucasfilm and then they announced

28
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,910
the star wars 7 was going to come out in

29
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,610
2015 personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really</font>

30
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,670
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing but other people are like her</font>

31
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,600
mergers and buyouts are really

32
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,010
interesting to me because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot</font>

33
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">about branding and how people</font>

34
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,390
individuals come to brand themselves in

35
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,040
a way that sometimes it's healthy and

36
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,530
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's completely entirely not</font>

37
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,570
healthy in any way whatsoever how

38
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">company's brand themselves how they</font>

39
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,950
create a brand how they let people know

40
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,810
what that brand is and then when you

41
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,259
test a random stranger in the street and

42
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:23,729
give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> flash cards and say what</font>

43
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,170
company would you associate this with

44
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,540
they mutually go to that company if the

45
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,189
branding is strong I didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had</font>

46
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,049
the interest apparently I do anyway so

47
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,729
the penguin Random House Manager for

48
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,920
example Random House has strong branding

49
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,869
the penguin has<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely strong</font>

50
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,939
branding I mean let's have a look if you

51
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,200
were to show someone that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

52
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably immediately know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was</font>

53
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,470
penguin similarly the modern classics as

54
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,790
well like that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that has</font>

55
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,560
been branded really well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's strong</font>

56
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,570
company branding helpful when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

57
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,090
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marge's ordered a harmful when you</font>

58
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,770
spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> so many years creating a brand</font>

59
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,250
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> different and displaying and</font>

60
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,020
talking and demonstrating in every sort

61
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,640
of way how it's different from those

62
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,259
other companies are trying to sell the

63
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,790
narrative that it is different<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

64
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,979
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> other companies what happens when</font>

65
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,810
those companies are forced to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

66
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,209
together and and create something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

67
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:11,160
and bigger personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the future</font>

68
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,150
for random

69
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,250
NASA's own system calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is probably</font>

70
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,470
very bright but that said I am a blazing

71
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,939
optimist so I can't be trusted

72
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,620
whatsoever the question of Disney and

73
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,060
Lucasfilm brings up another case of

74
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,950
branding now for me when I think of

75
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,510
Disney the moment I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of an</font>

76
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,640
incredible production company<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

77
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,200
put money behind firms such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

78
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,049
Avengers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make them possible I think</font>

79
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:31,950
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some great people working</font>

80
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,170
there picking some wonderful films to

81
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,730
fund and also something less wonderful

82
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,319
films to bunt but maybe the wonderful

83
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,700
ones and that's increasingly what's

84
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,290
coming to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind when I think of Disney oh</font>

85
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,569
yeah a production company people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

86
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,450
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money and the skill to find</font>

87
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,010
those films that they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> should back</font>

88
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,870
but the phrase Disney film has so long

89
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,760
been associated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Walt Disney</font>

90
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,190
hand-drawn animated classics or the

91
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,079
newer<font color="#E5E5E5"> animated classics that were done</font>

92
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,180
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> computers but for me that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> association</font>

93
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,680
has started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fade a bit because it's</font>

94
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">one I think of disney pixar that I start</font>

95
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,650
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of original work that's what</font>

96
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,480
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the discussion actually revolves</font>

97
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,760
around lots of different views on the

98
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,159
brands that are involved and what role

99
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,470
we think they should play in film and in

100
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,650
and in creation in general no<font color="#E5E5E5"> creation</font>

101
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,569
of the universe to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a creation films</font>

102
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,340
let's just dial it down a little bit

103
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,440
that's what's dominated my day thinking

104
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">about all of those things what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

105
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,250
guys think about branding what you know
