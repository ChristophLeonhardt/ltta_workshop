00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:15,630
about conditioner<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so on like</font>

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,150
shampoos on this video about

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,800
conditioners will have quite a bit of

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,660
information simply because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,820
conditioner than I do shampoo and it's

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,320
for this reason whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find a</font>

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,210
shampoo you're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> only looking for</font>

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,519
it to do two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep your hair</font>

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,109
moisturized regardless of the fact that

12
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,480
you're rinsing it out and actually clean

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,309
your hair so once you find a product

14
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,430
that does those two things it's over you

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,290
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and you just need to stick with</font>

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,030
it with conditioners there's several

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,710
things that you might want your

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,829
conditioner to do might want it to

19
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,300
moisturize your hair you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it</font>

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,039
to add strength to your hair with

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,140
protein you might want to be a deep

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,610
conditioner you might want to rinse it

out you might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it in you</font>

24
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,690
might want to detangle with it there's

25

be good to have several different

28

<font color="#E5E5E5">conditioners that do several different</font>

33
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,130
of stuff let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start off with the</font>

34
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,320
conditioner that I do not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

36
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,590
leave-in conditioner here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the price it</font>

37
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,140
made my hair hard that is the only

38
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason that I don't like it however I</font>

39
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,610
use any product I want my hair to go

40
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,720
soft fluffy caught me lead<font color="#E5E5E5"> airy I don't</font>

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,909
want to feel crunching this not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

42
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,189
gel I use it both as a washout

43
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,170
conditioner and as a leave-in

44
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,229
conditioner like it's marketed for in

45
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,049
both times my hair fell hard I think

46
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,640
would have to dive into science a little

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,320
bit

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,720
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a science major biology</font>

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,240
chemistry now that not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> close but</font>

50
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,220
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to take it there so</font>

51
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,229
let's let's go when<font color="#E5E5E5"> something makes your</font>

52
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,369
hair hard it could be because it has too

53
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,970
much protein hair is protein so if you

54
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,490
add a product with more protein in your

55
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,310
hair doesn't necessarily need that it

56
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,860
could add so much structure to your hair

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,360
that it won't move it won't be soft

58
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,860
etcetera etcetera I think that's what

59
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,780
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if I take a look at the</font>

60
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,239
ingredients I see there's hydrolyzed

61
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,750
wheat protein wheat amino acid collagen

62
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,750
you know proteins all these proteins

63
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,959
that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily mean so that's</font>

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,780
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made my hair heart I think moving</font>

65
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,000

this is how much it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it does the job</font>

69
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,400
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the swap conditioners I like</font>

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,030
the swap conditioners a little more but

71
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,620
of course I'm not going to buy them when

72
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,030
I have this much left a tip about

73
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,890
rinsing conditioner out of your hair

74
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,480
you're only supposed to rinse

75
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,970
conditioner out until the<font color="#E5E5E5"> water runs</font>
