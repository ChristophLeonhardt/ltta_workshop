are you having a great year fewer well I don't know if you are but you know who is having a great year thanks to Trump the Republican Party casino magnate Sheldon Adelson not only did his company not a first quarter windfall that's 1/4 of a year of 670 million dollars as a result to the massive Republican tax cut he also scored big in his foreign policy interests Trump scuttled the Iran deal as he hoped that he would and is gonna move the US Embassy to Jerusalem also a big Adelson priority so last week Republican Speaker of the House went to Las Vegas to meet Sheldon Adelson and collect a reward for all of his party's efforts a 30 million-dollar 30 million dollar check made out to GOP aligned super PAC with one hilarious caveat into how it was acquired quote as a federally elected official Ryan is not permitted to solicit seven-figure political donations when Ryan left the room norm coleman chair of the Republican Jewish coalition made the ask and secured the 30 million dollar contribution I want to bring in former assistant US attorney Maya Wiley Justin Cantor president of voting rights group let America vote and Lonnie Chen a former advisor to Senator Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential run Lonnie I'm going to start with you on Donald Trump's view on how Sheldon Adelson's giving works back in 2016 about the candidate you work for Marco Rubio take a listen I like Sheldon a lot he's been a person that I've known over the years we have a very good relationship and you know I'm self-funding I don't want anybody's money but if Sheldon gives to him he'll have total control over Rubio and that's the problem with the way the system works seems kind of accurate well first of all he didn't sell fun so you know let's just get that out of the way well that part isn't accurate yes agreed but but but but but with respect to how this works look I think in politics I hate to say it Chris but I think the role of money in politics is it's far too great and I think we see what happens on both sides it's not just a Republican problem Democrats have this problem as well and and so I would like to see less of a role for money in politics but obviously it does raise serious questions on both sides well there's a concentration here too I mean partly because the big is this chart is a favorite chart of mine Jason this is the estate tax part of the tax cut now the estate tax hits a tiny tiny percentage of people these are big donor heirs the Republican Party who literally got billions of dollars to their estate value on a small provision that doesn't really impact a lot of people and they're probably a tax cut and I think there's a reason to wonder if you're just basically purchasing this from the government it's a pretty basic return on investment here right oh it's like the best return on investment I've ever seen in my life even for a guy in the casino business ten million dollars and he gets six hundred and seventy million dollars back I guess he's decided to invest three times as much so the Republican Congress will maybe give him three times as much back I think this math is rather simple actually I thought Norm Coleman asked too low I mean you just you did you're up six seventy in the quarter I give you cut us a hundred here kind of we did we'll take half yeah but there's really nothing new about this I mean we've got a long long long history of it the real problem is that we've opened the spigots with the Citizens United case from the Supreme Court which unfortunately made a bad situation worse in terms of unfettered corporate spending to get candidates elected and particularly concentrated in the hands of the very rich Lani I mean the the the there's there early is an argument that in some ways everyone's spending way too little I mean Sheldon Adelson is a great example right if you look at his bottom line the guy I don't know write a billion-dollar check like there's like well you know what we right now have no limits on this sort of spending and it just seems like we're paving the path towards endless corruption yeah I mean it's it's problematic for a number of different reasons first of all obviously you've got massive individual donors on each side who are giving to these outside groups and by the way campaigns technically should not be coordinating with these groups so campaigns don't actually I control right over over over over what these groups do yeah so campaigns shouldn't be I mean you know obviously I think we know situations there have been situations where you're like hmm that's an interesting coincidence but anyway if you put that aside for a minute obviously the big issue here is the separation of the campaign itself and the message of the campaign from these massive outside groups have spent all of this money these trends are indeed very very troubling and they do end up sort of shining a spotlight on massive individual donors on both sides my money's done a good job here Chris of getting the term both sides in three times I mean I gotta give him credit if anybody was playing at home like cross that off your bingo card like Lonnie got in both sides three times there's a pretty big difference that should be pointed out here and that difference is one side thinks this is crazy one side says that's right this is not how this is supposed to work yes the rules exist and apply equally to everyone but one side says we should change these rules I'm glad to be on that side we should also note that to Lonnie's point in terms of how the system works the current system was created by a lawsuit by Mitch McConnell he said he said it's one of the proudest things he's ever done in his life and his and it is the position it is the sort of ideological position of the Republican Party Lonnie if I'm correct me I'm wrong it's the ideological position of the Republican Party that citizens united is rightly decided and this is how it should work yeah no I think a lot of Republicans take that point of view as sort of if you want to call them First Amendment absolutist that the notion is that corporate speech is just as protectable as individual speech because corporations individuals are indistinguishable we've had this discussion before on the show I think Chris but but look I think it is it is the case that most Republicans believe citizens united was correctly decided not all but most that's right can I just say this is really important the fact that we call corporations people is actually one of the ways we did that was actually through the one of the post-civil war amendments that was supposed to protect black people's citizenships in in this country and what we have seen and there's some research that shows that more Supreme Court precedent has gone to protecting corporations than black people so at the same time that we have all this voter suppression right whether it's voter ID laws or make it or eliminating early voting or making it more difficult for people to register through motor voter or any of the other ways it actually opens up the avenues for democratic practice at the same time we've seen a pull back from that we've also seen the floodgates have essentially a very few very very wealthy people being able to politics in a dramatic way there's also a foreign policy component here the rich donors might have different foreign policy priorities sheldon adelson is very intense when Policy Priorities is relate to Israel you can imagine people having an intense forum for Policy Priorities around brexit or NATO or Ukraine in the dawn blast right just depending on what their particular interests are but you get a US foreign policy where you have to wonder what is actually guiding it there was a time when we would like we had this practice that politics stopped at the water's edge and then we went through a period where it didn't really stop at the water's edge anymore and then eventually people just quit saying that all together and now apparently we have to be concerned that like one individual in Nevada can can you know very potentially and no matter what you think about the policy decision right at the end of the day no matter what that person thinks they probably should not have that outsized influence over the foreign policy the United States my well that's clearly right it's also clear and we should note it that there are other factors that impact elections including mobilization some of that money that is well spent actually goes to supporting people's ability to actually engage directly in elections and therefore have their voices heard on foreign policy as well as local issues and that money if the more money you have for mobilization and actual registration and access to the polls will actually translate into a greater democracy and that's one of the things we have to focus at the point you made is a good one which is a lot of this money on the Republican side we used to try and stop that well we'll see a lot of it's gonna be spent on the air and on Facebook as well Maya Wiley Jason Kander and Lonnie Chen thanks for your time hey there I'm Chris Hayes
