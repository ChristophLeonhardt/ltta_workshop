00:00:00,594 --> 00:00:02,830
RATED TV SHOW FOLLOWING A TWEET

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,398
THAT MANY PEOPLE CONSIDERED

3
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:06,234
RACIST AND ALMOST ALL, INCLUDING

4
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:09,537
ABC, CONSIDERED OVER THE LINE.

5
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:11,539
AND AT MISSOURI REPUBLICAN

6
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:12,340
GOVERNOR ERIC GREITENS, ONCE

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,108
CONSIDERED A RISING STAR IN THE

8
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:16,210
G.O.P. HAS JUST RESIGNED THIS

9
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,745
AFTERNOON I MADE AN IMPEACHMENT

10
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:18,713
EFFORT SPARKED BY A PAIR OF

11
00:00:18,713 --> 00:00:20,148
SCANDALS THAT WE HAVE BEEN

12
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:22,150
COVERING HERE ON SPECIAL REPORT

13
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,618
FOR WEEKS.

14
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:32,093
FIRST, TO OUR MIDWEST NEWSROOM,

15
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:35,597
AND GOVERNOR GREITENS WAS MIRED

16
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:39,334
IN POLITICAL SCANDAL, AND IT WAS

17
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:40,368
AN ACTIVE SPECIAL SESSION IN THE

18
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:45,106
MISSOURI HOUSE TO CONSIDER

19
00:00:45,106 --> 00:00:46,174
WHETHER GREITENS WAS GOING TO BE

20
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:48,176
THE FIRST GOVERNOR IN MISSOURI’S

21
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:48,844
HISTORY TO TEACH IMPEACHMENT

22
00:00:48,844 --> 00:00:49,244
PROCEEDINGS.

23
00:00:49,244 --> 00:00:53,548
HE WAS ALSO FACING A TRIAL AND

24
00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:56,952
NOW A SHORT WHILE AGO THE

25
00:00:56,952 --> 00:00:58,186
GOVERNOR FORMALLY ANNOUNCED HIS

26
00:00:58,186 --> 00:00:58,587
RESIGNATION.

27
00:00:58,587 --> 00:01:02,157
HOWEVER, THE GOVERNOR INSISTED

28
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:03,258
HE IS INNOCENT AND CHOSE CAREFUL

29
00:01:03,258 --> 00:01:05,260
WORDS TO STRIKE BACK AT THOSE HE

30
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,297
BELIEVED WANTED TO TAKE HIM DOW

31
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:10,299
DOWN.

32
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:12,101
>> THIS ORDEAL HAS BEEN DESIGNED

33
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:14,303
TO CAUSE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF

34
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:16,138
STRAIN ON MY FAMILY.

35
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:17,506
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MOUNTING

36
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:21,377
LEGAL BILLS, AND LESS PERSONAL

37
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:23,579
ATTACKS DESIGNED TO CAUSE

38
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,714
MAXIMUM DAMAGE TO FAMILY AND

39
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:26,048
FRIENDS.

40
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:28,551
IT’S CLEAR THAT FOR THE FORCES

41
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:29,552
THAT OPPOSE US, THERE IS NO END

42
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:31,854
IN SIGHT.

43
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:38,394
I CANNOT ALLOW THOSE FORCES TO

44
00:01:38,394 --> 00:01:39,729
CONTINUE TO CAUSE PAIN AND

45
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:42,264
DIFFICULTY TO THE PEOPLE THAT I

46
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:46,335
LOVE.

47
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:47,370
>> Bret: TODAY’S ANNOUNCEMENT

48
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,738
COMES EXACTLY TWO WEEKS AFTER

49
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:49,972
GOVERNOR GREITENS WAS FOUND NOT

50
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:51,541
GUILTY ON HIS FIRST CHARGE,

51
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,943
RELATED TO A PICTURE THAT HE

52
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:54,911
ALLEGEDLY TOOK AND TRANSMITTED

53
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:56,179
FROM HIS MISTRESS.

54
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:57,780
THAT PHOTO NEVER MATERIALIZED IN

55
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,148
THE STATE DROPPED THE CASE.

56
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:01,384
HE WAS ALSO CHARGED WITH FELONY

57
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:02,986
TEMPER AND TAMPERING OF A

58
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:04,587
COMPUTER RELATED TO MISUSING A

59
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:05,989
DONOR LIST FOR POLITICAL

60
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:06,456
PURPOSES.

61
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:07,657
TODAY A JUDGE RULED THAT HE

62
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:09,192
WOULD HAVE TO TURN OVER

63
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:10,827
PAPERWORK RELATED TO THE SECOND

64
00:02:10,827 --> 00:02:13,797
CHARGE, AND THIS VERY LONG SAGA

00:02:13,797 --> 00:00:00,000
OF SCANDALS INVOLVING THE
