COACH. SHE HAS A 13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, FRANCES, AND OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH THEM TONIGHT. WHAT A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE STORY THAT SURFACED THIS MORNING. ALSO DEVELOPING THIS EVENING, TONIGHT THEY ARE CALLING IT NOW I COMPETITION AND NOT A PAGEANT. THAT IS THE NEW MOTTO OF THE MISS AMERICA ORGANIZATION WHO ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY ARE BANISHING THE SIGNATURE BIKINI PORTION OF THE PAGEANT. INSTEAD CONTESTANTS WILL NOT TAKE PART IN A LIVE INTERACTIVE SESSION WITH THE JUDGES AND THE ORGANIZATION IS ALSO GETTING RID OF THE EVENING GOWN PORTION OF THE COMPETITION. I THINK SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SHOW EVIDENCE UP IN SWEATPANTS. SHANNON BREAM, OUR GOOD FRIEND, JOINS US TONIGHT. IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE WITH TUCKER AND SHANNON AND SO MANY OF THESE GREAT PEOPLE. I KNOW YOU DID NOT WANT TO SHOW ANY PICTURES OF YOU FROM THE PAGEANT TONIGHT. BUT I MIGHT HAVE FOUND SOME, I DON'T KNOW. Martha: SHANNON IS GORGEOUS, IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO LOOK BACK AND SEE THOSE. I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS, WHY DO YOU NOT WANT TO SHOW THEM? WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE WITH THAT? IT WAS SUCH A DIFFERENT TIME IN MY LIFE, I'M MISS AMERICA PAGEANT FOR ME WAS A GODSEND BECAUSE I WANT SCHOLARSHIP MONEY THROUGH THAT THAT PUT ME THROUGH SCHOOL, UNDERGRAD, AND A LOT OF MY LAW SCHOOL AS WELL. I DIDN'T COME FROM A FAMILY THAT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY OR MEANS. FOR ME THIS WAS A VERY FUN WAY TO STRETCH MYSELF. IT WAS TERRIFYING AT TIMES BUT IT PAY FOR SCHOOL FOR ME AND IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR ME. I'M NOT SURE ANYONE WANTS TO SEE MY SWIMSUIT PICTURES NOW. Martha: I WAS FROM NEW JERSEY WHERE PAGEANTS WEREN'T THAT VAGUE BUT TO WIN THIS FLORIDA AND MISS VIRGINIA, WHERE ARE ALL THESE GORGEOUS GIRLS IN FLORIDA AND VIRGINIA, YOU DID REALLY, REALLY WELL. BUT I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF, ARE WE PASSED THIS WHOLE THING AS A SOCIETY? AS WOMEN, IS THERE ANOTHER WAY TO HAVE A GOOD SCHOLARSHIP CONTEST IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE, THEY ARE GORGEOUS, JUST LIKE THE BACHELOR AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF. IF THERE IS MERIT IN BEAUTY AND THAT IS A SPECIAL ATTRIBUTE AS WELL. IS INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU KNOW MISS AMERICA STARTED OUT YEARS AGO IN THE 20s ON THE BOARDWALK IN NEW JERSEY. IN ATLANTIC CITY, IT WAS A SWIMSUIT CONTEST AT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND LOCAL BUSINESS PEOPLE CAME UP WITH TO KEEP PEOPLE IN TOWN AROUND LABOR DAY. IT EVOLVED OVER TIME, SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SWIMSUITS. THEY ADDED TALENT AND INTERVIEW AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. SWIMSUIT IS STILL A TINY PORTION, AND IT'S GOING AWAY COMPLETELY BUT, I DON'T KNOW THAT IT EVER REALLY DECIDED THE WINNER. IF THEY THINK IT'S A BETTER IDEA TO SAY, WE WANT PEOPLE OF ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES, AND PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN INTERESTED BEFORE, I THINK IT'S INTERESTING. AND I'M ALL ABOUT TAKING CARE OF MYSELF, CLEANING UP MY COLLEGE DIET AND WORKING OUT. IT WAS GRUELING BECAUSE I WAS ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME. I BLUE DRESS. Martha: EVERYONE LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE DECADES OLDER THAN THEY ACTUALLY WERE. I THINK YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. NOW, FOR FORMER HOUSTON TEXAN CHEERLEADERS ARE DELIVERING DEMANDS DIRECTLY TO NFL COMMISSIONER ROGER CADDELL. WATCH THIS. WE HOPE THAT BY DELIVERING THIS LETTER TO ROGER CADDELL TODAY THAT HE TAKES US SERIOUSLY, AND UNDERSTANDS THAT WE JUST WANT TO BE RESPECTED AND TREATED FAIRLY. AND COMPENSATED PROPERLY FOR THE WORK THAT WE DO. THEY WERE ALL SOMEONE'S DAUGHTER. THEY WORK HARD AND THEY CARE. THEY LOVE THE NFL. LET'S SEE SOME LOVE COMING BACK TO THEM IN TERMS OF WORKING CONDITIONS. Martha: YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE GLORIA ALLRED. BUT AGAIN, SHOULD THIS BE SOMETHING THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE ASPIRING TO? ALSO IN MY PAST I WAS A LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT LAWYER. YES THE PLAYERS ARE MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR BUT THEY ARE ALSO BRINGING IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR. SO IF THESE WOMEN ARE ALLEGING THAT THEY WERE PAID MINIMUM WAGE AT TIMES AND THEN THEY WERE ASKED TO TO GO TO APPEARANCES ASKED TO TO GO TO APPEARANCET ASKED TO TO GO TO APPEARANCEA ASKED TO TO GO TO APPEARANCET THEY NEVER GOT PAID FOR ABOUT THE TEAMS GOT PAID FOR TO HAVE THEM THERE, THOSE ARE SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS. YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO MAKE WHAT AN NFL PLAYER CAN MAKE, AND YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE WORK NEAR WHAT THEY MAKE. BUT IF THEY ARE NOT BEING PAID FOR THE HOURS THEY WORKED, THAT DOES CONCERN ME. Martha: THEY ARE BEING TOLD, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT, SOMEBODY ELSE WILL. SO I GET WHERE THEY ARE COMING FROM. SHANNON, THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU'VE GOT IT ALL GOING ON, EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T WIN THOSE
