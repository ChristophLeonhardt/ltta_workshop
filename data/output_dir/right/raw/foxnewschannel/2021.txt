SO IS THE DEEP STATE NOW

82
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,548
STARTING TO CRACK?

83
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,750
LOOK, WE ARE LEARNING EVEN

84
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,319
MORE POSITIVE NEWS ABOUT THE

85
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,288
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REVIEW OF

86
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,789
HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAIL CASE.

HIS TESTIMONY BEFORE CONGRESS

88
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,958
HAS BEEN POSTPONED.

89
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,793
BUT FOR AN INTERESTING REASON.

90
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:17,597
AFTER REPORTS SHOW THAT THERE

91
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,065
IS FINDING, HE IS FINDING NEW

92
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,333

JARRETT AND DAVID SHONE IN A

97
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:29,709
MINUTE.

98
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,613
BUT OTHER NEWS, IRAN, THE DEAL

99
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:34,281
IS IN THE BALANCE.

100
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,482
THREE YEARS AGO THE OBAMA

101
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,516

00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,587
WORLD A BETTER, SAFER PLACE.

104
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,089
IN REALITY THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR

105
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,025
DEAL SENT BOATLOADS OF CASH,

106
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,593
$150 BILLION WORTH, TO A

107
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,461

00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:54,267
OUR BEST ALLY ISRAEL.

110
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,603
ALL WHILE FUNDING TERRORISM

111
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,971

112
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:58,338
WORLD.

113
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,539
DEATH TO AMERICA, DEATH TO

114
00:03:59,539 --> 00:03:59,940
ISRAEL.

115
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,908
ALL TOLD WE SPENT $1.7 BILLION

116
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,643
IN YOUR CASH TO IRAN.

117
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,078
THEN WE UNFROZE $150 BILLION

118
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,649
IN ASSETS.

119
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,217
WE LOOSENED SANKS.

120
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,052
WHAT DID AMERICA GET IN

121
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:12,385
RETURN?

122
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,720
THE PROMISE FROM THE MUELLER

123
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,854
CHAMPING DEATH TO AMERICA THAT

124
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,991
THE ROGUE ISLAMIC THEOCRACY

125
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,492
WOULD TEMPORARILY HALT THE

126
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,493
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.

127
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,296
OF COURSE WE KNEW THE MUELLERS

128
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,397
OF IRAN WERE LIARS.

129
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,932
LAST WEEK THEY WERE PROVEN

130
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,367
LIARS BY THE ISRAELI PRIME

131
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,301
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU

132
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:34,574
WHEN HE UNVEILED IRAN'S SECRET

133
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,709
PLAN TO FURTHER NUCLEAR

134
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,609
AMBITIONS INCLUDING A PROJECT

135
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,311
AIMED TO CREATE FIVE WARHEADS

136
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:42,449
EACH CONTAINING A TEN KILATON

137
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:42,782
YIELD.

138
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,451
GIVEN THE DAMNING RECENT

139
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,285
DEVELOPMENTS, PRESIDENT TRUMP

140
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,720
IS NOW SET TO DECIDE THE FATE

141
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,154
OF THIS AGREEMENT TOMORROW AT

142
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,457
2:00 P.M. EASTERN.

143
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,157
11:00 PACIFIC.

144
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,258
LET US BE CLEAR.

145
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,794
THE MUELLERS OF IRAN ARE NOT

146
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,195
GOOD PEOPLE.

147
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,563
THEY HAVE KILLED AMERICANS IN

148
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,665
IRAQ AND THEY FOUGHT PROXY

149
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,933
WARS AND THEY WANT DEATH TO

150
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,368
ISRAEL AND DEATH TO AMERICA.

151
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,037
YOU CANNOT TRUST PEOPLE LIKE

152
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:04,404
THIS.

153
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,639
THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT

154
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,874
SUFFICIENTLY CHECK THE NUCLEAR

155
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:08,808
WEAPONS PROGRAMS.

156
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,977
BUT NONE OF THAT SEEMS TO

157
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,345
MATTER TO FORMER SECRETARY OF

158
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,113
STATE JOHN KERRY.

159
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,948
BECAUSE THIS DEAL WAS THE

160
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,716
SHINING JEWEL OF HIS TIME IN

161
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,486
THE OBAMA STATE DEPARTMENT.

162
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,354
HE IS REPORTEDLY PULLING OUT

163
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,689
THE STOPS TO SAVE THE HORRIFIC

164
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,126
DEAL WHICH PUTS THE WORLD IN

165
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:26,559
DANGER.

166
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,761
INCLUDING MEETING WITH IRAN'S

167
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,928
FOREIGN MINISTER.

168
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:29,396
REALLY?

169
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,330
AND OTHER FOREIGN OFFICIALS

170
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,364
FROM GERMANY AND FRANCE AND

171
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,699
THE E.U. WHO ARE INVOLVED IN

172
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,071
THE AGREEMENT?

173
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,473
THIS SHADOW DIPLOMACY

174
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,909
UNDERMINES THE

175
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:43,610
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND IT

176
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,277
NEEDS TO STOP.

177
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:48,548
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED THIS --

178
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,958
>> Sean: KERRY SPOKESMAN

179
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,162
RESPONDED IN PART --

REVEAL YET, WHAT?

182
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,604
ANOTHER STANDARD IN THE

183
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,572
TWO-TIER JUSTICE SYSTEM.

184
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,374
LET ME REMIND YOU.

185
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,909
REMEMBER THE FORMER ACTING

186
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,145

191
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:26,686

INVESTIGATOR DURING THE TRUMP

195
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,159
TRANSITION.

196
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,961
I REPEAT, THE TRUMP

197
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:35,361
TRANSITION.

198
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,429
FLYNN WAS PREPARING TO TAKE

199
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,597
OVER AS THE NATIONAL SECURITY

200
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,099
ADVISER BUT THERE IS NO LOGAN

201
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,801
ACT VIOLATION FOR JOHN KERRY?

202
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,903
WHERE ARE THE AGENTS IN THE

203
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,338
F.B.I. AND THE D.O.J. BREAKING

204
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,840
DOWN JOHN KERRY'S DOOR?

205
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,776
ANOTHER PLAY TANT EXAMPLE OF A

206
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,877
TWO-TIER -- BLATANT EXAMPLE OF

207
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,179
A TWO-TIER JUSTICE SYSTEM

208
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:53,680
TODAY.

209
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,948
WE'LL HAVE FULL ANALYSIS OF

210
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,616
THE INCREDIBLY FLAWED IRAN

211
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,651
DEAL AND KERRY'S UNAUTHORIZED

212
00:06:58,651 --> 00:06:58,985
ACTION.

213
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,187
WE ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT.

214
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,889
DID JOHN KERRY VIOLATE THE

215
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:03,156
LAW?

216
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,457
BUT FIRST, THE OBSTRUCTION AND

217
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,458
THE STONEWALLING FROM THE

218
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,626
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REACHED

219
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,061
A FEVER PITCH.

220
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,429
THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF

221
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,730
DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

222
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,198

228
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,409
WITHHELD OR MASSIVELY REDACTED

229
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,578
IN WHAT IS A CLEAR EFFORT TO

230
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,714
IMPAIR THE CONSTITUTIONAL

231
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,716
RIGHT AND DUTY OF CONGRESS TO

232
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,085
CHECK THE D.O.J. AND THE

233
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:32,719
EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

234
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,254
NOW THE INTEL COMMITTEE

235
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,221
CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES WILL JOIN

236
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,055
US IN A SECOND.

237
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,857
HE IS NOW ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING

238
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,059
FELLOW LAWMAKERS TO HOLD THE

239
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,895
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS

240
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,563
IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS.

241
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,064
EARLIER TODAY, SESSIONS

242
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:45,465
RESPONDED.

243
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,267
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

244
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,535
>> THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

245
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,471
HAS WRITTEN HIM A LETTER AND

246
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,540
RESPONDED AS APPROPRIATE TO

247
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,007
HIM.

248
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,209
THE REQUEST HE HAS MADE IS ONE

249
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,678
THAT THE INTELLIGENCE

250
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,812
COMMUNITIES AND THE DEPARTMENT

251
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,615
OF JUSTICE FEELS IS NOT

252
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:02,982
GRANTABLE.

253
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,218
WE HAVE EXPLAINED THAT WE

254
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,319
WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK TO

255
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,453
HIM ABOUT IT BEFORE.

256
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,155
THE DETAILS OF WHICH I

257
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,256
COULDN'T DISCUSS.

258
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:10,823
>> Sean: MR. ATTORNEY

259
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,659
GENERAL, I SAY THIS WITH ALL

260
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,092
RESPECT.

261
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,861
WHERE IS YOUR URGENCY?

262
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,663
YOU NEED TO DO YOUR JOB.

263
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,465
THIS HAS GONE ON WAY TOO LONG.

264
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,935
THESE ARE LEGITIMATE,

265
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:22,869
IMPORTANT REQUESTS.

266
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,672
YOU ARE NOT IMPERVIOUS NOR IS

267
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,640
THE D.O.J. IMPERVIOUS TO THE

268
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,008
RULE OF LAW AND OUR FEDERAL

269
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,810
SYSTEM OF CO-EQUAL BRANCHES OF

270
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,679
POWER AND CHECKS AND BALANCES.

271
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,881
THIS IS WITHIN THEIR

272
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,683
CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY.

273
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,318
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.

274
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,385
THE D.O.J. IS CLEARLY

275
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:41,554
STONEWALLING TO PREVENT

276
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,323
FURTHER EMBARRASSMENT GIVEN

277
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,124
THEIR PATHETIC TRACK RECORD IN

278
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,927
HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAIL CASE.

279
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,762
THE RAMPANT POTENTIAL WE KNOW

280
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:50,463
FISA ABUSES.

281
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,800
THE ONGOING WITCH HUNT IN TO

282
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,767
TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION WHICH

283
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:55,568
NEVER HAPPENED.

284
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,070
NOW IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

285
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,672
DOES NOT TAKE SIGNIFICANT

286
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,174
MEASURES TO FIND URGENCY AND

287
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,276
SPEED UP THE DELIVERY OF THESE

288
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,979
REQUESTED FOR MONTHS AND EVEN

289
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,714
YEARS OF UNREDACTED DOCUMENTS,

290
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,883
THEN IT IS TIME FOR SESSIONS,

291
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,285
ROSENSTEIN AND ANYONE ELSE WHO

292
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,221
IS OBSTRUCTING CONGRESS'

293
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,490
INVESTIGATION TO BE HELD IN

294
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,225
CONTEMPT AND FACE THE SERIOUS

295
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,827
LEGAL CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED

296
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:21,494
WITH IT.

297
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,297
A OTHER WORDS, MR. ATTORNEY

298
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,666
GENERAL, MR. DEPUTY ATTORNEY

299
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,469
GENERAL, IT IS TIME TO DECIDE.

300
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,038
YOU PART OF THE DEEP STATE,

301
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,874
ARE YOU GOING TO FIX OUR

302
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:35,942
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND LET

303
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:36,809
CONGRESS THE THEIR JOB?

304
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,278
THIS CONGRESS HAS A

305
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:38,778
CONSTITUTION.

306
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:42,582
AGAIN, SEPARATION OF POWERS.

307
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,783
CO-EQUAL BRANCHES OF CONGRESS.

308
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,718
CONGRESS HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL

309
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,388
ROLE IN OVERSIGHT.

310
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:53,559
STOP INTERRUPTING.

311
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,897
THANK YOU FOR THE DISPLAY OF

312
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,768
LEFT WING LUNACY.

313
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,136
THE PICK GINA HASPEL TO LEAD

314
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:03,536
THE C.I.A.

315
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,406
OVER THE WEEKEND SHE OFFERED

316
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,975
TO WITHDRAW HER NAME FROM

317
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:09,609
CONSIDERATION.

318
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,076
BAD IDEA.

319
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,245
SHE FACED FIRESTORM OF

320
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,079
CRITICISM FROM THE DEMOCRATS

321
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,881
AND THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA

322
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:15,848
BECAUSE THEY ARE CORRUPT.

323
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:16,516
BUT GET THIS.

324
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,618
SHE IS CRITICIZED FOR BEING

325
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,987
TOO TOUGH ON TERRORISTS.

326
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,121
HMM, I ACTUALLY LIKE PEOPLE

327
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,589
WHO ARE TOUGH ON TERRORISTS.

328
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:24,691
TAKE A LOOK.

329
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,993
>> IN 2002, SHE RAN A SECRET

330
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,895
C.I.A. PRISON FOR SUSPECTED

331
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:29,796
TERRORISTS IN THAILAND THAT

332
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,497
USED HARSH INTERROGATION

333
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,499
TACTICS INCLUDING

334
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,400
WATERBOARDING, SLEEP

335
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,203
DEPRAVATION AND EVEN SQUEEZING

336
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,471
DETAINEES INTO COFFINS.

337
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,572
>> YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FROM THE

338
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,973
LEFT AND THE RIGHT FOR HER

339
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:45,078
ROLE ON THE ENHANCED

340
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,981
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES.

341
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,483
SHE IS GOING TO HAVE A TOUGH

342
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,352
HEARING ON WEDNESDAY.

343
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,419
>> AT THIS MOMENT DONALD TRUMP

344
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,488
IS EFFECTIVELY ACTING THE

345
00:10:55,488 --> 00:11:02,095
U.S. SENATE TO PROMOTORTURE

346
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,696
BECAUSE TRUMP WANTS SOMEONE

347
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,766
WHO HAS TORTURED TO RUN THE

348
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:07,066
C.I.A.

349
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,501
GINA HASPEL.

350
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,003
>> Sean: DO YOU KNOW AT

351
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,939
GITMO, YOU THE TAXPAYERS PAID

352
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,674
FOR A SOCCER FIELD FOR THOSE

353
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,876
INVOLVED IN ENGAGING AND

354
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,311
KILLING AMERICANS.

355
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,880
AND WE TOOK CARE OF EVERY

356
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,081
DIETARY CONCERN.

357
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,316
AND WE TREATED ONLY THREE

358
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:26,018
PEOPLE THAT WERE WATERBOARDED.

359
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,387
PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHTLY IS NOT

360
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,788
BACKING DOWN TO THIS

361
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:29,489
RIDICULOUS CRITICISM.

362
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,391
HE REPORTEDLY HAS PUSHED

363
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,892
HASPEL TO STAY THE COURSE.

364
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,395
I SAY THE SAME THING TONIGHT.

365
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,096
HASPEL'S CONFIRMATION HEARING

366
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,500
WILL TAKE PLACE THIS WEEK.

367
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,434
RIGHTFULLY SO.

368
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,635
I MET HASPEL ONCE.

369
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:43,936
SHE IS A PATRIOT.

370
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,138
SHE LOVES HER COUNTRY.

371
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,639
SHE HAS WORKED HARD TO PROTECT

372
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,206
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

373
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,508
SHE MORE THAN DESERVES THIS

374
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:48,875
JOB.

375
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,077
AND I WILL TAKE IT A STEP

376
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:51,477
FURTHER.

377
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,945
WE SHOULD ALL THANK GOD FOR

378
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,247
PEOPLE LIKE GINA HASPEL AND

379
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,648
THE IMPORTANT WORK THEY DID

380
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,750
