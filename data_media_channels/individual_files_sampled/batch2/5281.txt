first Jonathan Allen my colleague here argues there has not been a darker moment for a president or for the presidency since Richard Nixon resigned on the verge of impeachment in 1974 those are some heavy words would you agree because last I checked Richard Nixon wasn't holding a rally on a night like that and their president Trump was at a rally with ardent supporters who think that yesterday was nonsense well that's a key difference here Stephanie is how the electorate processes all of this news if they're processing it really at all I think a lot of people especially now have just been so inundated that they can't really differentiate one scandal from another that said with the echoes of Watergate here and the unindicted co-conspirator and president Trump's involvement in the accusations of Michael Cohen has made against him this is going to shift to be the focus going into the midterms and Republicans are going to be knocked back on their heels and are even even graver danger of losing the house and possibly the Senate not just because of presidents Trump president Trump's legal troubles but I'm hearing a lot of concern that all of the ethical issues clouding congressional Republicans right now you have two sitting members of Congress Republicans who are under indictment you have this whiff of corruption around the presidency Democrats are already exploiting this in their television ads and let's remember the 2006 midterm elections which washed Republicans out of power in Washington also was about corruption everyone atributes it to the Iraq war and voter fatigue over george w bush but you had the Abramoff scandal you had Scooter Libby and then you had mark fully and that scandal involving the house pages and sexually explicit messages sent and this just all came crushing down on the Republican Party and and and I think that you're looking at a situation that is is if not as serious even more serious than that all right well then that's not a whiff Jeremy that's a stink President Trump just tweeted again I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family justice took a 12 year old tax case among other things applied tremendous pressure on him and unlike Michael Cohen he refused to break make up stories in order to get a deal such respect for a brave man what do you think Bret it sounds like the preamble to an eventual pardon for for mr. man afford look you know the president hired as this chief campaign adviser a man who would have been susceptible to Russian blackmail had he remained had he not been exposed by the New York Times in July or August of 2016 that's what people ought to understand about the danger that man afford pose not that he was just in office or just just in the campaign for a few months or that these charges go wait go way back it means that had he remained influential in the Trump in in the Trump campaign you would have had a man in possibly a high position in the administration who would have been liable to to a Russian compromising what I found really striking though is the is is the refusal to come to grips with the really big news of the day which is what happened with Michael Cohen because this is not about collusion this is not about Robert Muller this is about the way the president is what seems to be an unindicted co-conspirator in criminal activity a felonious violation of campaign finance laws that is going to proceed irrespective of whether the president fires Muller or not because this is happening in the Southern District that's really where where the president's jeopardy law is released yet to Brett's point that this is a preamble for a pardon that's what Trump wants to do when Trump is not a Republican Trump is a trump but I want to share how some Republicans have already weighed in senators John Cornyn Lindsey Graham about the conviction of Paul Manafort and the possibility of a pardon would you have a problem is the president were to pardon metaphor if he was one we're to pardoning man apartment that's above my pay grade that's the president's choice but I think I think I'd like to see the case run its course and let the courts do do their job I can't think of what mr. manna forts done to deserve her pardon he hadn't even gone to jail yet I mean you have to actually earn a pardon you have to show that you've learned your lesson well earning a pardon in the eyes of President Trump could be ultimate loyalty Ben Sasse put out a statement Paul Manafort is a founding member of the DC swamp and Michael Cohen is the Gotham version of the same neither one of these felons should have been anywhere near the presidency well I couldn't agree more and it may be above senator Cornyn's pay grade but it is not going to be above mine if I'm fortunate enough to be the next Attorney General the state of New York what do you mean because the Attorney General of the state of New York that office is second only to robert muller in terms of holding the president united states accountable he resides in New York the Trump foundation is based in New York most of his assets in New York and now we know that his criminal associates of which Michael Cohen is one also call New York home and regardless of what the President may do in terms of potentially parting pardoning Matta Ford or anyone else as Attorney General I will do my utmost and aggressively investigate and prosecute any person in progress the president only has the power to pardon for convictions of federal crimes he has no authority whatsoever to pardon for convictions of state crimes now state law in New York needs to be strengthened and I implore Governor Cuomo to call the legislature back in right away to in to strengthen state law but right now the Attorney General of the state of New York can prosecute any person that she chooses who has violated state law it makes it unnecessarily challenging to do so but it's not impossible the law should be strengthened as the next Attorney General I hope on January 1 without question will hold any person who has violated state law accountable regardless of whether they've received a pardon from the president United States oh heavens mr. Cohen mr. mana for you watching that what's your take well first of all with all due respect you missed a step in between Muller and the state attorney general's office which is the Southern District of New York and the Southern District looks like they're probing Trump on many different things and you can't get him on federal crimes as a state attorney general but my take is this is a really really sad situation for the country the President of the United States is an unindicted co-conspirator on two counts of conspiracy to commit election fraud that is a major problem and the president United States last night had his rally did you notice how subdued he was I have never seen Donald Trump at a rally looking so morose you reached out to me last night and the president may have been subdued but those people in the audience and people who in fatica Lee just watched Fox News they're not subdued they're going to support the president no matter what yes oh that's true but the President himself I think he's starting to grapple with what's going on and he seemed to be down he knew Michael Cohen who was on the inside of the inside of his inner circle for years the aide has now flipped on him and he is not going to be able to deal with this I think he is going to be backed into a corner and that's why we're seeing the preamble to the pardon miss Brett talked about and we're gonna see more things that are gonna stress him out come in the next month we've got Bob Woodward's book fear imagine how he reacts to that Bob Woodward's credible unlike Omarosa and Michael Wolfe then you've got the government shutdown that he's threatening over border security funding and now Republicans as an attempt both to deal or to get that funding and to talk about something else with the base are using the tragedy of Molly Tibbets and what happened to her being murdered by an illegal immigrant it's awful absolutely horrific but Republicans are ignoring what has happened and are not holding him accountable and I think that's unbelievably sad where you know John Cornyn saying it's above his pay grade no his pay grade is to be a check and balance on the executive okay but you've been saying that it's sad for a year and a half Jeremy Peters evan is saying it's sad we're talking about political courage Republicans you're down there on the hill do you actually think we're going to get any because thus far we haven't not yet no see Bannon said this is a moment we all need to check ourselves and get in line and mean and get in line behind Trump right and and and and that's representative of you know a hard core element of the Republican Party here and definitely you know a large percentage of the members of Congress to be clear but I I do think that if if you're looking just at Michael Cohen this is not a clean hit I mean let's not forget Michael Cohen is a guy who has repeatedly lied on the president's behalf yes he has bragged about that he has said actually that he doesn't know of any instances in which the president has ever lied he is also the person by the way who went on television and said that there is no way for you to rape your spouse when there were these questions that Aven a trump raised about an incident involving her husband when they were married so Michael Cohen is not a credible person and Republicans will do everything they can to remind people of that to discredit him and his allegations and that's what you're hearing right now not just from Republican lawmakers but also in the conservative media that shapes so much of the public opinion and I think that this is a case where for now at least people do write off the allegations around Michael Cohen now where that goes from here what else as Evan pointed out that could happen this government shutdown that that we could be fighting over in a few weeks it will contribute to even more perceptions of chaos you just don't know where this is going yes and Paul Manafort and conservative media went after Rick Gates as a liar and an adulterer but a jury found in both Paul Matt afford guilty on eight charges I want to bring in the conversation my dear friend Robert Kosta national political reporter for The Washington Post and of course moderator for Washington week on PBS all right Bob you tweeted this morning that you had breakfast with a quote veteran trump player what are you hearing and what does that mean well it means that people around the president or his longtime associates of advisers are keeping a close watch on him right now and one of them told me this morning that they feel this moment because of how everything happened yesterday it almost feels like when the special counsel was appointed following the president's firing of Jim Comey in 2017 at the FBI the president at that point was so taken aback by the quick turn of events that he began to unleash expletives in fury here's why I don't believe that because Friday night one of president's oldest friends out in the Hamptons richest got one of the richest guys in New York there was a big old fundraiser for the President and who were the attendees not president Trump's base forgotten Americans who finally feel hope very smart successful well-educated people were there toasting the president and his tax cuts so here's why I don't believe that well the president that you're getting at an important point Stephanie which is the president itself continues to reiterate to his friends that he believes he's successful that he believes he's under siege that no one understands his own success and so he feels the double barrel stories of mana for and Michael Cohen don't really get it the reality of his presidency he's repeating this to friends at fundraisers he's repeating it to aides on Air Force One as he flies to rallies but that doesn't mean this isn't still a president who watches cable news constantly and is unhappy with how everything is unfolding at least yeah yes I just wanted to correct something that Evan mentioned I did not miss a beat I'm litigated in federal courts across the state from the Western District of New York including the Southern District of New York I did not say I'd be prosecuting for federal crimes what I said is as Attorney General that I have the power on January 1 to prosecute any person pardoned or not for violations of state law violations of state law so I didn't want to I didn't miss a beat and I just wanted to correct the record for your viewer Stephanie one thing that's important is that the president can in extremis fire Bob Muller right he can end that investigation but he can't fire besides you know what it's Scrabble you can extremel solonius drama if you must kill it it's gravity good but look he can't fire the southern district this is why yesterday was so important I think this was fundamental change in the momentum of the story okay and people understand that paying hush money to a former Playboy actor a Playboy model and and and porn actress just weeks ahead of of an election that was decided by 70,000 votes is in fact material and importance of that I would add one more point which is that someone should remind Lindsey Graham and every other Republican officeholder who was in Congress in 1998 Mitch McConnell's in the turtle show right now it's hard to get to where they stood on impeachment I supported the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 98 because I think he had disgraced his office and he and he had committed perjury I think it is consistent on conservatives and Republicans to support the same for President Trump now given that campaign finance violations are much graver much more felonious for consistency we're talking about Paula I know I know but nonetheless Congress has an obligation and it's why Democrats should be put in office in November looking for consistency and we're covering politics one more thing playing out especially in the midterms you're seeing voters in poll after poll the majority the country wants Congress to be a hard check on the president and in swing districts only a quarter of those voters want the Congress to be subservient hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or
