1
00:00:01,903 --> 00:00:02,369
RIGHT NOW.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,103
>> Dana: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

3
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:06,306
I'M JOINED BY BRETT LARSEN.

4
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:08,041
MORNING ANCHOR ON MORNING

5
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:10,410
HEADLINES ON SIRIUS XM.

6
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,745
THE ALERT WORKED.

7
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:13,213
MY PHONE IS ON SILENT.

8
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:14,181
>> SO IS MINE.

9
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:16,650
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE ALERT YET.

10
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:18,151
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS,

11
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,987
THE ALERT GOES FROM FEMA.

12
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:21,822
IT GOES TO THE CELL TOWERS AND

13
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:23,557
THE CELL TOWERS WILL START

14
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:24,958
SENDING OUT THE ALERT OVER AND

15
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,460
OVER FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR

16
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:27,861
PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL EVERYONE

17
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,030
WHO HAS THEIR PHONE ON GETS IT.

18
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,531
IF YOU HAVE YOUR PHONE TURNED

19
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,500
OFF, IF YOU LEAVE IT OFF FOR THE

20
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:34,534
NEXT 45 MINTS.

21
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,336
>> Dana: I DID GET THE ALERT.

22
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:37,437
IT JUST DIDN'T MAKE THE SOUND.

23
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:38,672
I MUST BE ON A SPECIAL LIST THAT

24
00:00:38,673 --> 00:00:40,674
YOU'RE NOT ON.

25
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:43,210
>> YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SECURITY

26
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:43,644
CLEARANCE.

27
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:44,978
>> Dana: IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO

28
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:45,979
HAVE THIS SYSTEM.

29
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,080
>> IT IS A GOOD IDEA.

30
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,982
AS DOUG MENTIONED, WE'VE ALL

31
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,117
GOTTEN ALERTS BEFORE.

32
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:52,686
I REMEMBER MANY YEARS AGO DURING

33
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:55,522
HURRICANE SANDY STANDING OUT

34
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,024
WATCHING THE HUDSON RIVER COMING

35
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:57,925
UP THE STREET.

36
00:00:57,926 --> 00:00:59,259
WE ALL GOT THE WARNING AT THE

37
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,726
SAME TIME.

38
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,062
IT'S A GOOD IDEA WHEN YOU

39
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,430
CONSIDER HOW MUCH, HOW MANY OF

40
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,366
US ARE USING OUR CELL PHONES AND

41
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:06,500
AREN'T NECESSARILY, WE DON'T

42
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,636
HAVE A RADIO IN OUR POCKET.

43
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:10,971
WE DO HAVE A RADIO.

44
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:13,441
>> Dana: BUT FLOODING AND AMBER

45
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:13,774
ALERTS.

46
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:15,609
THOSE ARE LOCALIZED EVENTS.

47
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,977
WHAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE THAT

48
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:18,212
WOULD RISE TO THE OCCASION?

49
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:19,513
I CAN IMAGINE.

50
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:21,148
BUT WHAT DO WE KNOW?

51
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,383
>> WE WOULD ASSUME SOMETHING

52
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:24,485
LIKE A 9/11 ATTACK WOULD RESULT

53
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:26,020
IN AN ALERT LIKE THIS.

54
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:28,122
SOMETHING THAT DEFINITELY HAS AN

55
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:29,357
EFFECT NATIONWIDE.

56
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:32,093
NOT, AS YOU MENTIONED, AN AMBER

57
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:33,828
ALERT WILL BE LOCALIZED,

58
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:34,195
FLOODING.

59
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:35,996
THOSE ARE LOCALIZED.

60
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:40,167
>> Dana: IF YOU GET ONE OF

61
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:41,469
THESE, IT'S FOR REAL.

62
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,037
>> HOPEFULLY WE WILL NOT HAVE A

63
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:44,739
SITUATION LIKE WE HAD IN HAWAII

64
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,406
WHERE SOMEONE --

65
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:48,876
>> Dana: ACCIDENTALLY.

66
00:01:48,877 --> 00:00:00,000
RIGHT.
