step back for a second before I get to the breaking news actually so you got remember a couple of nights ago the on CNN there's a 2-hour town hall and this town hall special was specifically designed to make gun owners members of the NRA Second Amendment advocates feel as though they were morally inferior as though these people were somehow responsible for the horrors of what had happened inside that school over in parkland Florida and all that was nonsense of course the sheriff of Broward County Scott Israel did this beating of his chest and it's wailing and gnashing of teeth blending the NRA and the availability of ar-15s well now we know exactly why this shooting happened and it happened because authorities failed on every single level all of them it wasn't just the FBI got two calls and did nothing it wasn't just the Broward County Sheriff's Office received 39 separate calls to this piece-of-crap tome over the course of seven years when just that now we have even more information you ready for this we want to talk bombshells here the bombshells on Thursday night the American public learned that Broward County Sheriff's Office was told in November then the Periclean shooter quit quote could be a school shooter in the making but deputies didn't bother to write up a report that report came just weeks after a relative called urging the BSO the Broward County Sheriff's Office to seize his weapon then here's the even more shocking news we learned that an armed school resource officers when it's just mind-boggling an armed school resource officer and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School sat outside and waited for four minutes the entire shooting episode of six minutes the Broward County deputy was outside heard the shots waited outside with his gun for four minutes and did not enter the school can attack ended with 17 dead people including at least a dozen dead kids and the Broward County sheriff's deputy whose job it was he's the arm school officer it is his job to drush that to brush that guy he sat outside and he didn't do anything he sat outside and did nothing we also know by the way that the schools the schools tape the school's security mechanism was tape-delayed so whatever they were seeing on the cameras was twenty minutes running twenty minutes behind this guy was sitting outside apparently he heard the gunshots and he did nothing even the Broward County Sheriff himself Steve Israel acknowledged this yesterday in a press conference shocking stuff here is what Israel had to say Scott Peterson was absolutely on campus for lesson two it through this entire event he was armed he was in uniform but what I saw was a deputy arrived at the west side of building 12 take up a position and he never went in and he never went in okay this guy's sat outside and he did not go in now a lot of people today on the Left aren't doing this room because they want to make this about the guns and not about the fact that there was an armed officer there who did nothing instead of it because they want to make it about the availability of weapons they say well can you blame them this guy not charging yes I can blame him and I don't have to be a police officer or soldier to blame him I wasn't in that situation I also didn't volunteer to become an employee of the Broward County Sheriff's Office and become an armed school officer that is this guy's only job you had one job and when time came you coward and it wasn't just that okay are you ready for this this gets even worse it's get significantly worse this is breaking in the last 15 minutes CNN reporting quote when Coral Springs police officers this different district when Coral Springs police officers arrived at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in parkland Florida On February 14th in the midst of the school shooting crisis many officers were surprised to find not only that Broward County sheriff's deputy Scott Peterson the arm school resource officer had not entered the building but that three other Broward County sheriff's deputies were also outside the school and had not entered the deputies had their pistols drawn and they were behind their vehicles the sources said and not one of them had gone into the school so while this monster was roamings classroom to classroom with his rifle mowing down students for deputies for armed uniformed deputies were sitting outside then get in there try and save the kids then get there to try and rescue the kids after the COS had been shot they waited for an entirely new Police Department to get there and go inside there's something fishy going on here folks there is something going on here because that I promise you when people sign up to be sheriff's deputies they're not doing so thinking that they're gonna cower behind a car they're doing so thinking that they want to help save people so there's something going on and this thing Steve Israel knows the answer and he ain't telling us Steve Israel discounted this sheriff he knows exactly what happened here and he is not telling us there's a rumor online that I hesitate to report because I don't know that it's well substantiated this has more to do with sheriff's policy than anything else but we're gonna find out because something happened here where four deputies were sitting outside with their guns drawn and a monster inside massacring children and they didn't go inside they're gonna told me that's the NRA his fault they're gonna tell me that's Dana lashes fault you're gonna tell me that's my fault living in Los Angeles and my guns in my safe you're gonna tell me that's the fault of $100,000,000 owners who weren't there many of whom would have run the shooter and tried to do something just like what happened in the in the Texas Church shooting where an armed citizen took down the bad guy bad guy who's just an armed citizens and a hell of a lot more than any of these cops did in Broward County this is insanity I don't tell you something that's even more insane here's something that's even more insane again remember just a couple of days ago it was this schmuck Steve Israel who's standing on stage amidst a bunch of the citizens from Broward County and shouting at Dana lash and telling aunt Dana lash that it was her fault that all this had happened that it was the NRA s fault that all this has happened Virtue's signaling and posturing about how we just need to get guns out of the hands of bad people well the guns were in the hands of the right people but they didn't do a damn thing according to CNN is the worst law enforcement failure in modern American history seventeen dead people because there are cops waiting outside who didn't go in there and here's the thing that's amazing about this okay so I ripped down the CNN special because I thought that it was a an emotional setup I think that it was it was an emotional setup it was specifically designed to destroy the the proponents of second Amendment rights it was I thought this reputable I thought it had no news value it was just two minutes of hate it was due to Orwell's two minutes hate here's what makes it even worse well Israel was doing this there were questions rakers all this came out this morning there were questions that came out over the last couple days about what Israel knew and when he knew it because now we know he's admitting it full on that he had two deputy there who didn't pull his gun and didn't go inside and there now we're finding out from CNN there were three more deputies so the question is when did he know that did he only find out about that after he ripped Dana lash to shreds and after he ripped the NRA to shreds and after he blamed Second Amendment proponents for what happened or did he know that while he was on that stage and is he's such a dishonest piece of human debris that he went on that stage and blend everybody but himself when he's the guy in power he's the guy with star on his chest he's the man responsible for taking care of those kids that is his duty that is his job that is what he was hired to do that is what he's paid to do that's only got his pension from and that guy was standing at it so when did he know it well fortunately for us CNN reports isn't me reporting it in daily wire reporting it in the right-wing piece of news media reporting at eight Fox News this is CNN okay according to Coral Springs City man Mike good rung on February 15th the day after the shooting this is a direct quote from CNN okay direct quote from CNN the choral City Springs manager city manager chewed out Steve Israel over that malfeasance on February 15th he approached him the day after the shooting he said my people told me that they got there and your people were outside doing nothing which means that not only did Israel probably know it he was informed of it directly by somebody else and then a week later he went on national television and ripped somebody who had nothing to do with it and blame them for the problem how disgusting is that how repulsive is that I mean that is just the level of moral despicable 'ti necessary to do that is just astonishing so two levels of absolute degradation moral degradation one for police officers waiting outside while kids get mowed down one guy inside with a gun for people outside with guns that's that's level number one which is the worst and then level number two is the cover-up where you blame everybody but yourself when you're the one responsible for it absolutely horrifying absolutely horrifying in every possible way now what if the media done about this well the media of course have continued to blame the NRA the media have continued to suggest that its gun owners second Amendment advocates everywhere who are doing all of this you know President Trump said today he was speaking at CPAC and President Trump said today that the Second Amendment was under threat and Jessie single guy who I'm friendly with from a former leave New York magazine he and I got into it on Twitter because he said what kind of nonsense is that the Second Amendment is under threat well that same Steve Israel was on stage calling for a full ban on semi-automatic rifles which is any working rifle in the United States that's not a bolt action or a lever action rifle or a muzzle loaded rifle it's a basically are calling for a vast ban on the most common guns in the United States and then telling us that's not a violation of the Second Amendment and we're supposed to feel comfortable with this you roll out a 24/7 propaganda effort by the news media to say that guns are responsible for something well it's pretty clear the authorities didn't do their job and I'm supposed to feel comfortable with you guys so here's here's the case you're making to me Steve Israel here's the case you're making to me Barack Obama here's the case you're making to me all the folks in the media on the left in the case that you're making to me today is the FBI failed twice to do anything about this school shooter and then the Broward County Sheriff's Office failed 39 times to do anything about that shooter and then there were armed people from the Broward County Sheriff's Office there four of them apparently and they didn't do anything about the shooter and I'm supposed to hand over my gun to you I'm supposed to hand over my ability to defend myself to you why in why in blue blazing hell would I do that why would I hand over my only ability to protect myself to people who are going to stand outside with the guns that I gave up and not rush the shooter again the people in the media are just it Scott is there a lot Steve in general rather the the people in the the the people in the media have been attempting to spin away from this story all day now it's even worse obviously because it's not just one officer it's for the way they've been spinning away from this so lawrence O'Donnell was the worst lawrence O'Donnell last night goes on TV and he says how can you expect one man to charge into the line of fire even if he's wearing a uniform I love these same people who say that the cops are racists the cops are pathetic we shouldn't trust the cops we can never trust the cops and now all of a sudden they're the big defenders of cops they only like cops when cops don't actually do anything apparently so this cop didn't run in he didn't do anything so lawrence O'Donnell says you know why he didn't do that because the muzzle velocity of a rifle is three times the muzzle velocity of a handgun so the officers gun had a lower muzzle velocity than the shooters rifle did that any idea how ridiculously stupid this is this defense so is the idea that this guy would be able to avoid a fired bullet from a handgun does he have matrix likes ability as soon as he picks up an AR suddenly he can bend over backwards like Keanu Reeves and make sound waves in the error behind the bullet is that the idea here let's say they're standing a hundred feet apart we'll do a quick back of the envelope math here our typical rifle fires about 3900 feet per second that's the muzzle velocity is about 3,900 feet per second a typical handgun is about 1,300 feet per second what's it they were standing 100 feet from one another let's say that he ran into the hallway and they're standing a hundred feet from one another that means that if they fire the bullets simultaneously the bullet fired from the rifle would hit approximately five one hundredths of a second before the bullet fired from the handgun are you telling me it's purely impossible for that officer to get in there they'd have a five five hundredths of a second advantage cuz not even fast enough for you to blink your eyes hey you literally would not even see that okay that's how fast it is and yet we're told that this is the deciding factor or do we have tremendous we have to have tremendous sympathy for this officer again I wouldn't want to be in that position as an officer but that's why I didn't sign up to be an officer and if I had a gun as a civilian I hoped that I would have the balls to rush in there and try to do something but if you're gonna make the case the government should have the only authority to stop mass shooters if you're trying to make the case that we shouldn't arm teachers or we shouldn't arm private security guards or that citizens shouldn't be armed there you have to do better than that you're gonna have to do better than that but who's really to blame on all of us who's really to blame according to the media of course it's always Republican it's obviously Republicans who are a problem so the boycotts are now beginning against the NRA so even though we've learned in the past 48 hours that the authorities failed on every single possible level multiple times who's getting blame the NRA so a bunch of folks on the Left are now going to people who have business deals with the NRA and urging them to cut off the business deals so enterprise rent-a-car announced today that they would end the discount that they have for NRA members they're just a business deal and surprise rents Carter tweeted thank you for contacting us all three of our brands this would be enterprise-d alamo national have entered have ended the discount for NRA members this change will be effective March 26 thank you again for reaching out kind regards Michael so there we are now it turns out that we're gonna as our corporations are gonna be pressured to blame gun owners law-abiding gun owners remembers the NRA for this remember if the NRA played any role in these shootings the most role the NRA played in these shootings was having shooting classes for J ROTC students and also training the guy who took down the the shooter in Texas not one of these shooters has been a member of the NRA not one and yet the NRA is being blamed for this and Scott Israel is not just amazing wasn't just enterprise by the way Hertz came out and they've said now they're gonna disassociate from the NRA now listen we'll get to the NRA in a second how the NRA has handled this because I don't agree with everything that was said yesterday at CPAC I was at CPAC it was wonderful thank you for coming it was great to see all of you I had blast talking to all the students and young people and I think I I hope I said some important things to the media about how they've treated people who are gun owners and what they can do to help stop the spate of mass shootings but I don't agree with everything that Wayne LaPierre or even Dana with good friends I said yesterday at CPAC but the media's drive to blame this on Gunners is just insane so Trevor Noah the execrable host over on Comedy Central the least funny man in America I can safely say that because Samantha B's the least funny woman in America so he's the least funny man in America Trevor Noah and he says that Marco he's mocks Marco Rubio because Marco Rubio went to this CNN show trial where people are baying for the head of Marco Rubio and begging for the head of Dana last parent they are calling her a murderer and and Trevor Noah ripped into Marco Rubio all the really powerful moments and now thanks to that father we all know what Marco Rubio's face looks like when he's crapping his pants looked like a dad trying to explain to his son why he cheated on his mom he was like you say you see Cameron sometimes a politician has needs and and when the NRA opens their wallet it's so hard to resist you know this reminded me of it reminds me of the reaction a lot of men had to the me2 movement you know when people were like if we carry on like this we're gonna live in a world where men can't even hit on their female staff that is what we want okay okay so this is this idea that Rubio is of course the bad guy here I'll be interested to hear what Trevor Noah has to say about the law enforcement officers already you're seeing the the spins starting from the left that what this really demonstrates is that a good guy with the gun can't stop a bad guy with a gun no what it demonstrates is that a useless person with the gun cannot stop a bad guy with the gun it does not demonstrate the good guy with the gun can't stop a bad guy with the gun because it's always been a good guy with the gun stopping a bad guy with the gun the problem here is he didn't have a good guy where were the good guys you were absent they were missing and the media treatment here is so egregious it's so egregious and again they just keep hosting these students to go on there and the ones who they keep hosting or of course the ones who are the biggest advocates for for gun control there was one parkland student who was he he was this is one of zyf actually the next the next clip where he was talking about Trump and suggesting of course that Trump listens to people like the NRA who are putting blood money in his pocket I wonder how how Samuels wife's parents voted for a County Sheriff in Broward County actually hearing about here's Samuels life blaming Trump for the NRA giving him money or somesuch everyone saw in his note card and said I hear you and I think he did hear us but he wasn't listening to us mainly because he only listens to people putting money in his pocket in this case blood money my friend's blood a lot of my classmates blood and it's I don't think we're gonna get far with him right now the NRA does not have blood on its hands to use this kind of language as I said yesterday at CPAC it is despicable and vile and I don't care if you have suffered in terms of whether it makes that statement moral or not I care if you've suffered in terms of your suffering I feel terrible for anybody who's suffered had to go through this but again as I said yesterday it does not make what you are saying moral it is not moral okay it is not moral to blame keep we're not responsible for bad actions for bad actions that is an immoral act it's an immoral thing now I want to take a quick note here before I move on and I do want to debunk something that's been going around there's been a lot of talk about CNN scripting the people at the Town Hall now CNN was biased in that Town Hall they knew full well that this was going to be a crowd bang for anti-gun measures they knew that these people were going to mistreat Rubio they knew that these folks were gonna mistreat Dana lash they knew that there's gonna be screams they didn't do anything to shut it down they knew that all the people who are asking questions we're gonna be anti-gun advocates they knew exactly how this was gonna go I know this because I know people at CNN okay they knew exactly how this was gonna go but the notion that this was all scripted that all these students were told what to say by producers at CNN that is not so true so the right-wing media I think have suggested something that isn't true and I want to point that out what probably happened is that these students were asked to boil down their questions into little pieces of paper that they could read now is there a bias to that clearly there is because Cameron Caskey the student cast to get in Rubio on stage and said to him that he was like the Parkland shooter himself which is again just morally deficient in every possible way that that was allowed to go on for minutes at a time but some of the pro-gun students were told to basically condense their questions into the small assembly so there is a bias but the bias does not extend to CNN producers were actually writing out the questions for the students there's not any clear evidence of that at this point Jake Tapper says that this is normally how it's done and from what I've seen at other town halls that's not a surprise okay so I want to get to the editor and responds to this now and the NRA response to this has been some good and some bad so first of all I let Dana lash speak for herself so Dana as I've said before is a friend of mine I'm gonna try and put my biases aside here because I like Dana I think she's a nice gal and and talk in all honesty about the the NRA response so Dana was at CPAC yesterday and she was talking about what happened at the CNN Town Hall and here's what she had to say you heard that town hall last night they cheered the confiscation of firearms and it was over 5,000 people I had to have a security detail to get out I wouldn't been able to exit that if I did not have a private security detail there were people rushing the stage and screaming burn her and I came there to talk to solutions and I still am going to continue that conversation on solutions as the NRA has been doing for before I was alive okay so that story is confirmed by the fact that you can actually hear in the audio he played it yesterday people shouting out at her that she's a murderer while she's on stage and Jake Tapper nobody CNN stops it and says guys calm down we're trying to have a discussion here instead it just continues and jake has said online well I didn't want to I didn't want to tell people what they could feel it's not a matter of telling people what they can feel it's a matter of providing good news stuff right it's a matter of good providing good news content it's a matter of ensuring that you are not just doing a propaganda special and CNN failed in that I mean I've never seen a propaganda special quite like that on national TV now Dana in response to this said something that I think is not true and I don't think is used for good she said that many people in the media love mass shootings now maybe what she meant by this is that there are people in the ratings Bureau who look at the ratings they say look at our ratings today they're really great but if what you meant by this is that people in the media are fine with mass shootings or want to or are happy about mass shootings then that of course is not true she should have been a lot more specific in her language sure she said at CPAC yesterday a lot of folks in the media love mass shootings now I will say again I think there are people in the media who use mass shootings as a lever for their favorite politics but I don't think anybody in the mass media is sitting around going god I hope 15 kids die today at a school I think that's that's a slander and members of the media and I say that because I think the media have been slandering me I think the media been slandering Dana I think the media have been slandering everybody on the right by suggesting that we have bad motivations then we don't care when kids get shot so I think it's silly for us to suggest people on the left own Carolyn kids get shot we cannot have a good conversation a useful conversation in this country if we keep saying the other side doesn't care when kids get shot if you really believe that your political opponents are such evil human beings that they don't care when kids die we can't have a conversation at all it's the end of our country there will be a civil war if you actually believe the person who lives next door to you doesn't care if your child dies in a bloody hail of bullets then you're gonna be much more likely to pick up a gun and go after that guy so just put it that way here's Dana saying this yesterday at CPAC now I'm gonna say something that some people are going to say is controversial so I'll say it really slowly so all the people on the platform in the back can hear me loud and clear many in legacy media love mass shootings you guys love it now I'm not saying that you love the tragedy but I am saying that you love the ratings crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many in the legacy media in the back ok did but the suggestion here is that they care more about their ratings than they do about the dead kids I don't think that's right I don't think that's right listen I think they care too much about the ratings I ripped them from the stage yesterday suggesting that they should put their morality ahead of their ratings and stop showing the names and faces of the shooters but I wouldn't suggest that they actually like the shootings that they actually want the shootings to happen like that I don't think is appropriate wayne lapierre from the other eye did this to again i think this doesn't actually serve the NRA's interest what the nra should be doing right now is saying listen we want to stop this stuff as much as you do and it's insulting and disgusting when you suggest that we don't but to reverse the charge and suggest the people in the media actually like the mass shootings it's too much Wayne LaPierre did the same thing yesterday again I don't think this is the smart move few leads don't care not one whit about America's school system and school of children if they truly cared what they would do is they would protect them for them it's not a safety issue it's a political issue ok so again this is this is a mistake it's a tactical mistake it's a moral mistake and you're getting it from the other side so now you have both sides screaming at each other the worst people on earth keith Ellison of course comes out and he says the Wayne LaPierre has blood on his hands this is the stick that the entire Democratic Party has fallen into he doesn't want to talk about the fact that since the assault weapons ban lapse in 2004 we've seen a 239 percent increase in gun related deaths he doesn't want to talk about the blood that has spilled all over his hands because of the Lexx policies that he's pushing he wants to make people afraid and he wants to tell people lies and distortions rather than deal with the fact that he is in Sicily and trafficking in fear in order to line the pockets of his clients in the gun Manning this stuff is just it's just gross and it's not worthwhile it doesn't do credit to the NRA it doesn't do credit to the NRA's opponents doesn't do it credit to any of that now Allison Cammarata had on Dana lash today and that want to show you two clips of that because one of them I think demonstrates the lack of credibility on the part of the media and the other demonstrates why it's a mistake to castigate the media and say they don't care about mass shootings which of course is not true here's the first one Allison cammarata saying listen when you say that we like mass shootings that's just nonsense and here I have to agree with Allison Cammarata you think well I said many I said many not all but I do think that the way that loves the network and I do think that the way that I do think that many in the media do because they like the ratings aspect of it and that's true because it's wall-to-wall coverage they put the murderers face up on on loop none on televisions all across America more than they discuss even the victims or survivors I mean if an individual's name has been mentioned and is still mentioned on your network you know it's just it's just malicious actually that you would say that I don't know anybody in the media who likes mass shootings you're wrong on every single level okay so this is why okay so this is why Dana shouldna said what she said about the media now Dana says but you say that about me right you guys say that I'm a murderer you guys yell at me you say burn her you say that I'm responsible for these mass shootings and now Allison camera are the shoes on the other foot in Allison Cammarata can't even acknowledge that this is exactly what the media have been doing which they have right so here is Dana being in the right and camerata being in the wrong this is 19 yeah you you're saying that it's malicious but yet on your network you've allowed accusations against me and millions of law-abiding Americans and to be indicted as child murderers I've watched you Allison understood that you have this very timeslot and you've done corrected on your network it's not I don't believe you Dan I don't know any of you that I did I don't do nothing and making it even easier for these horrifying people to get guns because if you can't get elected without taking money from child murderers why are you running hey guys are you gonna be able to go back to school right we played that clip on the show the other day so here's Allison Cammarata saying that no one's called you a murderer that kid call hurry murder right on allison camera show and allison Cammarata sat by and did nothing so that is not so again dishonesty dishonesty and more dishonesty from the media that doesn't mean that people on the right should fall into the trap of accusing their political opponents of being bad human beings except insofar as the people on the left accuse us of not caring about dead kids okay by the way another piece of breaking news this is just how many red flags do you have to miss here and then standing outside for deputies I mean it's just it's heartbreaking it's heartbreaking somebody should go to jail for this they really should here is this is a call according to the New York Times a transcript excerpt from Adam Goldman of the New York Times of an FBI tipster warning the Parkland shooter in January quote okay I just figure I was talking with the operator and she transferred me I'm like I said to her I don't know how to go about this but on the Instagram account I have I wouldn't say he's crazy by blood but I would consider him bleep he's only 18 he's got the mental capacity of a 12 to 14 year old his mother just passed away on the first of November he's got Instagram accounts he started off saying he wanted to kill himself so what I did was I called the Parkland which is where he lived Parkland Police Department I spoke to an officer I didn't hear anything I left a message I gave him all the information I had and then just recently now he switched it he wants to kill people and then he put that on his Instagram in about two days later he took it off if you go on to his Instagram pages you'll see all the guns he's variant Isis I'm afraid this is something that's gonna happen because he doesn't have mental capacity he can't he's so outraged if someone talks to him about certain things and he had pulled the rifle on his mother before she passed away because she wanted to get money um and the whole and another problem is that he's 18 and his mother's life insurance policy is coming in he's gonna receive 25 grand from that and then 21 24 up to 30 he's receiving 25 grand every year after that he went out and took money out of his mother's account I don't know how he got the debit card but he did he took the money and then the Social Security money right and he bought all these rifles and ammo he posted pictures of them on the Instagram this is a transcript of a call to the FBI transcript will called the FBI he never graduated high school he's thrown out of all these schools because he would pick up a chair and just throw it at somebody a teacher or student because he didn't like the way they were talking to him I just think about you know getting into a school and just shooting the place up direct transcript to the FBI nobody did a damn thing and you're gonna tell me I'm supposed to give it my gun to these clowns to these jokers I'm supposed to give up my ability to fend myself to these morons you've got to be freaking kidding me never going to happen not

righty so um you know what let's just go right to things I like things I hate in the mailbag because I know honestly I'm emotion doubt yeah at this point I'm not I'm not wanting to be to run on feelings it's not that that's what that's not the gas that I usually have in my tank but this has been such a disturbing upsetting pathetic week for the country really a terrible week for the country the last week and a half the way that Americans are treating each other and seeing each other and it's really heartbreaking to watch so let's just go to the mailbag and since it first let's do things I like in things I hate so first things I like so there's a movie that came and went and wasn't really seen by a lot of folks called thank you for your service with miles teller I really like miles teller a lot as an actor it's basically a new version I would say of the best years of our lives which is one of the great coming home for more movies of all time Best Picture 1946 now this one is not that but it's about three soldiers who are coming home from war in Iraq and they all three have serious PTSD and how they have to deal with it here's a little bit the trailer you'll see the bomb unless they want you to what you got I don't see nothing now you don't see he feels it so then the movie is is pretty gritty it's it really doesn't focus too much about what happened in a rocket it focus a lot more about the adjustment home and how there's a lot of the veterans who are falling through the cracks which certainly is true I guess it's a little bit hard on the military but as somebody who's never been through this I can't really say that that that's for sure whatever it is anything that that helps propel more money to the VA more resources to soldiers who are coming home from war I'm very much in favor of hopefully it's as accurate as possible of course ok time for a quick thing that I hate then we'll get to the mailbag so the thing I hate today is the movie Lady Bird so everybody loves this movie now Mathis loves this movie I know moles liked this movie which is one reason to hate it but the movie Lady Bird is getting all sorts of plaudits because Greta Gerwig is the first-time director and apparently if you're an actress and you can also do a plot a plausible job of direction then we think that you're the greatest thing that ever lived this movie I thought was extraordinarily twy twy is just a word meaning kind of cutesy too cutesy by half all of the dialogue is overwritten not it's you know the performances are good all around but every beat of the movie is predictable they're a bunch of threads that are just left hanging for no reason and the the theme of the movie is actually nice right I like it in spite of the theme of the movie the scene the theme of the movie is there's a girl who's basically obnoxious she's an atheist and she is pro-abortion and over the course of the movie she learns that she should be less obnoxious that's essentially the plot a sunny bunch at the weekly substandard I think put this well and the free beacon I think that he put this well he said this is basically an hour and a half long version of Roseanne except the film's a little bit nicer and that's basically right the mom's kind of you know the tough-talking but but truthful one and the dad is the pushover and the girls Peyman but so you know if it's your cup of tea enjoy it was not mine I didn't think that it was any great shakes the fact that it's nominated for Best Picture I think is a little bit weak they should have nominated for sure to the Florida Project which is not nominated for Best Picture they should have nominated that they should have left this off the list instead but yeah we'll show you a little bit of the preview I suppose I think I want to go where culture is like my research or at least Connecticut or New Hampshire and writers living above into those schools anyway mom should just go to City College you know with your work ethic just go to City College and then to jail and then back to City College and then maybe you'd learn to pull yourself off and not expect everybody everything Lady Bird is that your given day yeah in quotes I gave it to myself it's given to me by me Lady Bird always says that she lives in the wrong side of the tracks but I always thought that it was like a metaphor but there are actual train tracks okay so here's the good news about the preview you just saw every clever line in the film so most of the cleverness in the film is actually in that in that two and two minute segments right there that one minute segment um it's it I thought the move drag a little bit not a fan okay I know there are people who disagree but just man okay time for time for some mailbag so if you have questions now is your time to send them in live if you're in our daily wire chat room then you can send your questions now okay Seth says hi Ben I'm a pro Second Amendment gun-toting Texan it seems the American values have changed so much since the Second Amendment was enacted is it possible that in today's society we've too far we're too far gone to be trusted with the freedoms that so many have sacrificed for well I would say that there are a lot of people who are certainly misusing their freedoms but that's not a problem with freedom that's a problem with virtue and it's our job to re-encode virtue the solution to to lack of virtue is not curtailing freedom it's to reinstall virtue but those are the two choices you're right those are the two choices and this is why when Liberty people who are cultural libertarians now even governmental libertarians I'm sort of a government to libertarian but a cultural libertarians people who say that community values don't matter very much now that we're atomized individuals when people on the Left say that you can just destroy the social fabric no problem then first you no longer is an aspect of our common heritage when people say that and inevitably is going to lead to more governmental tyranny or it's gonna lead to a real collocation of virtue I vote for virtue Parker says Haven I always encounter liberals that say red states consume more welfare than blue states is this true and if so why so the answer is yes this is true the reason this is true is because there are federal welfare programs that go to poor people there are more people in red states than blue states on per capita level okay so yes that is true it is also true that the people who are voting for the higher levels where wealth around the federal level are not from the red states so the people from the blue states are whining about this maybe they should stop voting for all the welfare programs we could start there James has been I keep hearing conservative advocates of mental health reform suggest the idea of bringing back the ability to involuntarily commit people deemed unfit and dangerous to society what are your thoughts on the potential abuses of such a practice how would you suggest protecting against them so as not to put individual Liberty at risk in a similar fashion to overly restrictive gun control laws enforcing punitive measures against law-abiding citizens this is a great question the answer is that you have to have a certain burden of proof so danger to self or others is usually a pretty high burden of proof involuntarily committing somebody even for a 24 or 48-hour holds in the state of California for example is actually pretty difficult you have to show the person's suicidal or that the person is violent I assume that you'd have to show the same thing to a judge and that wouldn't just mean you going there and testifying that's the case of the judge you probably need some form of evidence that that is the case and you'd have to need more if you if it was based on witness testimony it would have to be more than one witness and you know the truth is that I think judges are fairly good at sussing masada I don't think that you're facing as well if the worry is that you're leftist family members are going to forcibly prevent you from getting guns by going and testifying in front of a judge then you know maybe that would happen once in a bajillion tries I just I don't I don't see this as a major problem maybe I'm wrong it's possible that I'm wrong but this is why you need a high evidentiary bar you can set a high of an entry area bar by suggesting that it's not just by preponderance of the evidence that it's beyond a reasonable doubt this is the case for example like you get there different standards of proof that you have to meet beyond reasonable doubt is usually a criminal standard preponderance of the evidence usually a civil standard but you can set up whatever standard you want there bradon's has been what is your opinion on right-to-work states I'm an employee of Washington State I'm forced to pay union dues regardless of me joining a union or not as expected Washington state leans very low heavily to the left with its policies and the Liberals lifestyle choices so this of course is true I used to do a show up in Seattle and it is certainly the case that Washington is a lefty state it is also true in the state of California you have to be a member of a union in order to work in certain areas right to work should be a constitutional amendment you should be able to work in any industry that you want to without being a member of a union unions are fine in the private sector when people are voluntarily joining them and juanique aren't being broken they are not good in the public sector and the silly idiotic legislative idea that you are going to legislate do you have to be a member of a union to work as a teacher undermines the interests of students remember when there's a public sector union the people they are collectively bargaining against are the taxpayer that's the person on the other side of the table if you're in a private sector Union and you are collectively bargaining you're doing so against the person who owns the business who owns the federal government okay we own the federal government which means that every time a union bargains with the federal government they're bargaining with the taxpayer what makes it worse is that when they're not actually bargaining with your me they're bargaining with elected representatives and those elective representatives take donations from whom from exactly the people with whom they are bargaining so that's not that's a pretty corrupt cycle it's a good book called shadow bosses by a friend my name a Laurie factor that goes into all of us Antonius has been I live in Anaheim and while I agree that many homeless people are mentally ill I'm surrounded with homeless individuals that are around my age and it is visually obvious that they are on drugs not mentally ill you can see where they inject themselves in the rashes on their bodies do you think that there is a growing amount of homeless people due to drugs rather than mental illness yes I mean I have said that I think that a huge percentage of people who are on the streets are either drug addicts or mentally ill or both that's obviously true you can see it in the needles on the streets now as I was walking a block from my house the other day and I found a needle on the street and it's just it's just horrifying and this is you know one of the arguments against legalizing hard drugs that this excuse your ability to reason and makes it so you can't actually have free choice in how you choose to behave and so we have to live in that dramatically whatever it is there's no excuse for people to be living on the streets one of the ways that you can clean up this problem is by taking people who are living on the streets and either putting them in a facility against their will so they can clean out and if they're mentally ill doing that or if they're a drug addict putting them in a facility where they will clean out and be taken off of drugs Ben says hi Ben I was just curious what things led you to realize you were going to marry your wife was there a specific moment or factor that made you decide that you were gonna pursue her how did you actually propose to her so here's my view of romance and this is a very realistic view of romance I think the first thing that has to happen is of course there has to be physical attraction you're not gonna want to talk to the person if you think that they're not attractive okay that is always the first thing so when I first saw my wife I thought this is a smoking hot person so so that was the first thing that I thought when she saw me by the way she thought dorky but cute was was the way and she that was that's I think that's still a very flattering response to my physical appearance but that's how she felt about it she actually thought I was a jackass when I drove up it says I used to drive a 2006 GT Mustang convertible baby blue and so I drove up in that and she thought oh who is this Pete who is this jerk and then I got out and I was wearing like mom jeans and a beat-up polo shirt and she's like oh I was just a nerd okay and she was happy about that which is why I love my wife um the reason that well what made me think of this so number one I could hold it an intelligent conversation with her at number two we had values in common so as I've said before we dated for marriage that meant that our first date was about free will and determinism our second date was about if I recall gun control in the death penalty on our third date we finally talked about TV shows so so there was a heavy bias toward talking about things that mattered to us we talked a lot about our religious heritage we talked a lot about how many I mean I asked her on first date how many kids she wanted right this is the difference between dating for marriage and dating to just date now in the Orthodox community you're typically dating for marriage because he can't date for sex cuz that's not something they're supposed to be doing so that means that you actually have to date for values which i think is a good thing as a general matter and as a specific matter actually Anne says dear Ben I've been enjoying you in the daily wear for the past six months after the crazy election I started taking the Hillsdale College Constitution 101 online being frustrated when politicians MSM and people toss around tidbits of the Constitution to suit their agenda what I've discovered is very few people understand or have truly studied the Constitution I know it's true for me my question is about executive orders when how and what is the criteria for their use seem since FDR it's been used regularly and maybe out of control the answer is yes it has been used regularly and yes it is out of control so executive orders have existed since George Washington but what an executive order was designed to do is there was a piece of legislation and it would say we direct the president to go and impose this law and so the president would then write in order to like the three people who worked for him this is very small executive branch and say you three people are authorized to go do it right so it's just a question of filling in a gap the law left but the law had to mandate that the executive was to do that now the executive does things like President Obama saying he's not going to enforce the law with dackel which is unconstitutional nor the President of the United States going into war on the basis of an executive order where he doesn't have the authority to do so so that is that is you know absolutely in in overreach on the part of the the executive branch manthie says you have said it's done to get the rights at different ages such as how to buy alcohol you must be at least 21 but 18 to vote do you believe the minimum age to be president should be lowered not really not really I think that maybe it should be heightened actually but when the minimum age to be President was 35 years old the average life expectancy in the United States is probably 50 55 so 35 was probably the equivalent of 50 in our society so when in an age when people who are 26 years old they're still on mommy and daddy's insurance and live at home and aren't married and have no kids no I don't think we should necessarily lower the age to be present I wouldn't want I wouldn't want like right now if one of these kids from Parkland were to run against Trump that kid might win that seems not like a great idea to me because I don't I mean the standards for our presidency are so low already do we need to lower them any further we just had an election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is this something is this what we want to do is this what we want to do let's make it let's make it more rigorous to become a candidate for high office how about that Andrew says hey Ben I recently had a civil conversation with my classmate about gay marriage I use your argument how the federal government shouldn't be in the business of marriage and main purpose of marriage is the procreation of children and it provides a stable foundation for family and society she agreed with most of my argument she didn't agree with it completely because she believes tax the gay married couple should still get the same tax bonus as heterosexual married couples do I said her I didn't know about the specific issue and we ended the conversation there how did I make a counter-argument well if she already accepts the idea that the federal government only has an interest in marriage because of raising families and children then why should there be a federal tax benefit that it that accrues to you because you're sleeping with someone with whom you are incapable of having children naturally that doesn't seem to me to make a whole hell of a lot of sense I don't think it should be tax benefits for any of this stuff by the way I think the government discriminating in favor of certain couples and against other couples just seems like a fool's errand at this point I don't think anybody is having more kids based on the tax benefits that doesn't seem realistic to me but the idea is that if you if the government is gonna occur confer advantages based on what it gets out of the deal the government gets a lot out of the less out of the deal from from gay couples than it does from straight couples in terms of childbearing and rearing obviously by statistics and that will always be true no matter what because people like having sex and when straight people have sex there's a chance of a baby and when gay people have sex presumably with each other there's no chance of a baby just sorry about the biology folks that's the way it works okay final question Eric says dear mr. Shapiro as a father with the young daughter enrolled in my local New Jersey School District I was so upset by the media's handling of the Parkland school shooting that I subscribe to daily wire today as a way to fight back well I appreciate it thank you is there more I can do would you say my money helps conservatives like ourselves fight the disinformation being spewed on a daily basis I mean I hope so that's what we do on a daily basis I think that there are a lot of people joining the NRA for particularly this reason and I don't think that's a terrible idea at all I think you should go and talk to your local school district about the safety measures that are actually being taken on campus but yeah I mean this is it this is a real public opinion battle that's being waged right now and every little bit helps oh we appreciate everybody who's joining up for the memberships we couldn't do the show without you so here's a hard PIP for a hard pitch for becoming a subscriber the reason we can do this business every day is because you support us so please go over and subscribe right now at Daley wire.com okay we will be back here on Monday try not to ruin the country further in my absence it's already bad enough so please just have a let's have a safe quiet as happy as we can weekend and we'll be back here on Monday I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our technical producer is Austin Stevens edited by Alex and Garo audio is mixed by Mike Carmina hair and makeup is by Jesuit Oliveira the Ben Shapiro show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright for publishing 2018
