1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,110
These are some of the most beloved films in
the history of American cinema.

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,840
But they all share something else in common:

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,219
They were all censored by the Catholic Church.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,160
In fact, for decades, there’s a good chance
you didn’t see anything in a Hollywood movie

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,080
unless the Catholic Church wanted you to.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,120
Hollywood in the late ’20s was chock-full
of films about pirates, lovers, and monsters.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,200
But not everybody was happy about that,

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,520
most notably Catholics,

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,030
some of whom were
alarmed by what they viewed as the crumbling

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,979
morality in motion pictures.

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,000
Two devout Catholics, a publisher named Martin
Quigley and a Jesuit priest named Father Daniel Lord

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,860
(that’s his real name),

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,900
decided to
do something about it.

14
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:51,909
In 1929, they wrote the Motion Picture Production
Code, a set of proposed moral guidelines for

15
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:52,940
movies.

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,809
It prohibited such things as nudity, indecent
dancing, and ridiculing religion while requiring

17
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,699
the promotion of Roman Catholic values where
good triumphs over evil and immoral behavior

18
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:04,699
is punished.

19
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,820
There were also slightly less folksy provisions
like barring romance between different races

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,040
as well as “white slavery.”

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,320
Yikes.

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,620
When the big five studios — Warner Brothers,
Paramount, MGM, Fox, and RKO — received

23
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,689
the guidelines, they agreed to them.

24
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:24,040
Why would Hollywood ever willingly sign on
to censorship like this?

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,520
We always have to remember that movies had
no 1st Amendment rights during this time.

26
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:35,530
And that meant that any state or municipality,
or, by extension, the federal government,

27
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,119
could censor motion pictures.

28
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:39,190
This is Thomas Doherty.

29
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,090
And these are his slippers.

30
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:48,009
And there are real fears in Hollywood that
Roosevelt’s New Deal government, which is

31
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:55,149
proliferating government agencies with great
abandon, is going to create a federal censorship

32
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:57,880
agency to censor American movies.

33
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,100
Studios chose to adopt it voluntarily hoping
that it would deter government interference.

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,160
But then in 1930, the Great Depression hit.

35
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:11,900
Following the economic downturn, movie attendance
tanked and studios scrambled to do whatever

36
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,120
it took to sell more tickets.

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,800
And what sells tickets?

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,640
Sex.

39
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,670
Violence.

40
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,930
And big-ass goblets of booze.

41
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:27,880
So for a period of four years from 1930 to
1934, Hollywood studio films were pretty f***ing

42
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,000
crazy.

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:42,000
The Roman Catholics especially get very upset
by this, and in late 1933 and early 1934,

44
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:45,900
they begin organizing something called the
Legion of Decency.

45
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,460
What sounds like the lamest superhero franchise
ever actually released publications of all

46
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,069
studio movies with their accompanying rating
—

47
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:58,750
A being morally unobjectionable, B being morally
objectionable in part, and C being the dreaded

48
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,750
condemned.

49
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,769
The legion had something called the Legion
Pledge, and you have 20 million Catholics

50
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:10,579
at Mass and at Knights of Columbus meetings
would stand up, raise their hand, and pledge

51
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:17,870
on their immortal soul that they would not
attend motion pictures that the church deemed

52
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,250
unworthy and unholy.

53
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,189
To avoid a devastating boycott, Hollywood
created the Production Code Administration

54
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:29,330
to enforce the guidelines and appointed devout
Catholic Joseph Breen as its head.

55
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,450
Here’s Edward Herrmann playing him in The
Aviator.

56
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,780
I can state categorically that I have never
seen anything quite so unacceptable.

57
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,549
The Breen office would get a script from a
studio, and he would go through them line

58
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:49,870
by line to make sure that nothing was said
or implied or visualized that defied the Production

59
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,440
Code.

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,920
For instance, here’s a couple of their notes
on the Jimmy Stewart film It’s a Wonderful

61
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,930
Life:

62
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,349
Page 21: While it will be acceptable to indicate
Gower as having recourse to drink because

63
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:04,000
of his disturbing emotional problem, we must
ask that he not be shown at any time offensively

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,420
drunk here or throughout the scenes.

65
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,420
This is important.

66
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,519
Page 37: The action of Harry slapping Annie
on the fanny is unacceptable.

67
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,159
Page 38: This reference to impotency is unacceptable.

68
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:22,350
The Breen office approved every aspect of
a film, every image, every line of dialogue,

69
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,680
ad mattes, marketing, costumes, and it really
makes him one of the most powerful men in

70
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,150
Hollywood history.

71
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,120
And by extension made his office one of the
most influential in Hollywood.

72
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,120
If you look in the credits of every Hollywood
film from 1934 to 1954, you can see the PCA

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,960
logo.

74
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,440
Without it, your movie didn’t stand a chance.

75
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,160
The PCA got to say which movies the studios
could make.

76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,020
And since the studios owned many of the theaters
in the country, most audiences only had access

77
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,020
to Production Code films.

78
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,320
You could almost call this arrangement a monopoly.

79
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,720
And some people did.

80
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,560
Nine people, to be exact.

81
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,480
US v. Paramount Pictures was a landmark antitrust
court case in 1948 in which the Supreme Court

82
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,920
said this kind of monopoly was illegal and
forced the studios to sell their theaters.

83
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,310
Since the studios could no longer control
what was shown, it opened up the floodgates

84
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,670
for independent and European films, neither
of which needed to abide by the code.

85
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:22,020
The PCA quietly existed until 1967, when the
Motion Picture Association of America took

86
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,510
over and American film switched over to a
ratings system.

87
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:31,040
So I always see the code as something that’s
not good or bad but something that is inevitable,

88
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,200
and it allowed them to create a lot of great
art.

89
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,390
I mean, if you look at the movies made under
the Production Code, we're talking about,

90
00:05:38,400 --> 00:00:00,000
what, hundreds of marvelous creative works
of art that people still look at today.
