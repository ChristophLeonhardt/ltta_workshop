they're not coming out
I'm trying they're not coming out I'm an
iPhone user I have been for a long time
and for a very long time these have been
a big part of my life and had to get a
new pair of these like probably wants
every four or five months look I'm just
gonna put this in my ear how's that look
I feel like all my why that bald guy
from Empire Strikes Back those feels
securely snug in there look at that okay
let's let's like put this to the test
I'm gonna run up this little ramp here
hey Allie how are you ready go nothing
Wow they're snug there in there so let's
see what they sound like they didn't
give us any music already pre-loaded on
there not even that that u2 album
let's see gucci mane really good sound

listen to that you hear that oh wow when
you when you take it out of your ear it
pauses that's cool let's see what happen
we put him back in okay they don't want
it started back up again
whoa I just worry like I look I feel
like I look kind of funny at least I
look different I know that everybody's
going to you know adapt to this I don't
have to worry about the the cord getting
caught on a doorknob and getting yanked
out of my ear which happens a lot I love
the idea that I'm just free and I don't
have to worry about this anymore
I'm tired of this knot I'm so tired of
it
