1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Okay. so think back to high school.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,670
I know this might be painful, but picture your

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,220
typical daily schedule. 50-minute blocks,
one for each subject: Chemistry, Geometry, English, etc.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,960
This is what the school day
has looked like for most students in the

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,510
United States for about the last hundred
years, but that's changing. For a small

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,199
but growing number of students, the
school day looks more like this.

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,119
Ten minutes working on a math worksheet
then 15 minutes on an English paper, then

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,240
20 minutes on Facebook and then a
three-hour shift bagging groceries.

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,200
That's because in 32 states and D.C.,
students of all ages don't actually have

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,400
to go to a physical school building.
Instead they can attend online charter schools, full time.

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,850
In their advertisements, these schools promise

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,660
students and parents autonomy,
flexibility, and peace of mind.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,320
If I didn't have Florida Virtual School I
probably would have been a dropout. I can

14
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,270
start and end work when I want to. After
years of bullying and changing schools I

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,520
could finally learn at my own pace.

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,220
There's just one problem with these

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,160
schools: for the vast majority of
students they don't work.

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,480
The share of

19
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,450
American students who attend online
charter schools is small. It's less than

20
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,240
1%, but enrollment has grown fairly
steadily since 2011 and their growth is

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,650
part of a wider movement in public
education known as "school choice".

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,740
It's the idea that parents should have
options beyond the neighborhood public school.

23
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,140
It's a notion that education
secretary Betsy DeVos has championed for years.

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,640
The more choices we have, the more
competition we have, but also the better product.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,220
Like traditional public schools,
charter schools are funded by a mix of

26
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:50,939
federal, State, and local taxes. But while
taxpayers elect school board members to

27
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,899
oversee traditional public schools,
charter schools are different. If a group

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,700
of people want to start a school, they
sign a contract or a charter with the State.

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,480
Some charter schools have longer
hours or use a different curriculum.

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,740
Most have a physical building, but a growing
number don't.

31
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,000
For both types, the state

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,440
pays the group a set amount for each
student that they enroll.

33
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,220
Most of the groups that run online
charter schools are for-profit companies.

34
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,440
The largest are k12 Inc. and Connections
Academy. They run 122 online charter schools

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,880
in 29 states, which enroll more
than half of all online charter students nationwide.

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,130
They're both part of publicly
traded companies, which means that some

37
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,360
of the tax dollars they get for running
schools go towards paying their shareholders,

38
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,280
One of whom used to be Betsy DeVos.

39
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,040
Gary Miron is a professor of education.
He studies online charter schools and he

40
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,660
crunched the numbers and found that
these companies made:

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,100
In their ads k12 and other online

42
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,350
charter operators tout their
research-based curriculum, but the data

43
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,940
show that kids in online charter schools
are falling way behind. One way that

44
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,020
researchers measure a school's success is
to look at students test scores at the

45
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,070
beginning and end of a school year and
see how much they've grown. In the most

46
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,420
comprehensive study to date, researchers
at Stanford University looked at 17

47
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,130
states with online charter schools and
compared their yearly growth to regular

48
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,670
public schools and charter schools in
those states, that serve similar

49
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,240
populations of kids.

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,050
They found that attending an online charter school had

51
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,340
the equivalent effect of missing 180
days of instruction in math.

52
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,100
In most places that's an entire school year. In
reading, students lost about 72 days

53
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,400
compared to their peers in regular
school.

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,480
There were a few exceptions.

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,340
Online charters in Georgia and Wisconsin
had significantly better growth scores

56
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,970
in reading than regular schools, but
those states only serve a fraction of

57
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,170
the country's online charter students.
The vast majority live in states where

58
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,470
attending an online charter school is
statistically equivalent to missing

59
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,440
weeks of school.

60
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,920
They're allowing these
companies to operate charter schools,

61
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,040
sometimes with more than a hundred
students per teacher. That's more than

62
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,580
six times the national average for
public schools.

63
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,239
We reached out to k12 and Connections and both companies

64
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,530
disputed the methodology of the Stanford
study. K12 said they changed their

65
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:19,060
curriculum since the study came out in
2015, but a 2016 study of online charters in Ohio,

66
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,940
found that students there are
still doing significantly worse than

67
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,680
their peers in regular school.

68
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,240
So, if these schools get such poor results,

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,660
why don't states just shut them down?

70
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,500
Online charter companies like k12 and

71
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,280
Connections have spent millions on
lobbying and campaign contributions at

72
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,309
the state level.

73
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:47,780
Of the 64 online
charters they ran in 2011, all but one

74
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,380
were still open in 2016. And 55 new ones
had opened for business.

75
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,800
States have the power to hold these companies
accountable they're just choosing not to.

76
00:04:58,360 --> 00:00:00,000
And students are paying the price.
