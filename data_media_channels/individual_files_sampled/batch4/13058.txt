Muller is watching tonight because I know I probably have implicated myself in something I am both sorry and relieved to say I have had no personal experiences with porn stars please leave me alone please do not raid my offices or anything like that so tonight in Russian ambassador Huntsman hall at the Trump University we will discuss a very important topic reasons to vote for Donald Trump this sounds like the title of my blank book I wrote a book that became a number-one national bestseller called reasons to vote for Democrats a comprehensive guide it is at the risk of being boastful it is the greatest and most important and urgent political treatise of our generation and what but the difference in my talk this evening and in reasons to vote for Democrats is there will be words in this talk there will be some of the best words folks huge huge words and I hope they're convincing so the main reason to vote for Donald Trump the main reason to vote for Donald Trump is because it makes Democrats cry and they're salty delicious leftist tears give me joy that's that's I could leave the speech at that I think that would be the main reason that I'd do it and that is not a joke that's actually a morally serious statement be I should be a specific it it makes Democrats cry and it makes the far-left cry and those were not always the same thing there there used to be Democrats who weren't on the far left Ronald Reagan was a Democrat scoop Jackson was a Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan joe Manchin is like the last survivor of this ilk they were all Democrats but they weren't on the far left or the intersectional left as we call it today that that difference is mostly evaporated today there's very little distinction Barack Obama campaigned and said I want to be elected president so that I can fundamentally transform America and I don't know about you but I usually don't want to fundamentally transform things that I like or the I love you know I don't say to my fiance sweet little at least I say oh honey you know I love you so much I can't wait to fundamentally transform you I the very core of your being I want you to be different than you are which is what our former president said of our beloved country his wife the former first lady in a moment of accidental honesty said she had never been proud of her country she had never been proud of her country until the one time it made her husband president that was the only time and the first lady before that the former future president Hillary Clinton called half of her countrymen deplorable and irredeemable and apparently didn't like them very much that is the Democrat Party today that is why they're salty delicious leftist ears give me such joy and would be reason enough to vote for Donald Trump but there are other reasons as well this divides into two questions reasons to vote for Donald Trump in 2016 and reasons to vote for Donald Trump in 2020 let's take them in order the reasons to vote for Donald Trump in 2016 are Hillary Clinton that's the reason it's like that book that she wrote what happened Hillary Clinton that's the only book that answers the question that it asks right there on the cover is the reason to vote for Donald Trump he was much much better than Hillary Rodham Clinton Hillary Clinton openly campaigned on gutting the first and second amendments this is not some conspiracy theory this is not reading between the lines in some esoteric way it was right there on her campaign website she campaigned on gutting the first and second amendments in fact in order to gut the First Amendment and the right to political speech she wanted to overturn a Supreme Court decision called Citizens United vs. FEC Citizens United versus FEC was literally a decision about whether or not one can criticize Hillary Clinton it was a decision about her in 2008 a conservative organization called Citizens United wanted to run a film that was critical of Hillary Clinton and they were told they couldn't do him a federal judge said that was not allowed 30 days before the Democrat primary that year luckily it made it to the Supreme Court and they decided correctly that individuals do not surrender their constitutional rights when we organize in groups we don't give away our rights to political speech just because we we work with one another to quote Mitt Romney corporations are people my friend you know it's not like it's a building or something where people we have those rights she ran to gut it same thing on the second amendment she read the second amendment preserves for Americans an individual right to keep and bear arms this has not been controversial from much of our history it's necessary it says a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed now listen these are all Ivy League students here at Trump University you all know how grammar and sentence structure works the independent clause of that statement is the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the dependent clause the justification Clause of that statement is a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State also the reason it has to protect an individual right is that militiamen bring their own guns they do they're not a standing army they bring their own guns so if you have a militia that presupposes the people bring their own guns and furthermore US Code defines militia as virtually all able-bodied men nevertheless nevertheless Hillary Clinton ran to overturn an important victory for that constitutional right in Heller these were major planks of her campaign so what did Donald Trump campaign on well he campaigned on protecting constitutional rights to begin those two rights he ran on reforming the tax code making the u.s. more competitive Iran on protecting life protecting religious liberty peace through strength of foreign policy that was robust and would ensure the world peace and protect the world order he ran on enforcing immigration law which is apparently now considered very cruel and an awful we can get into that perhaps in the in the Q&A later but he ran on saying to a free people a sovereign people that yes we will enforce the laws that have been passed democratically in this country and you the people of this country get to decide who comes and goes and who uses certain benefits and and will accept risks and responsibilities in that regard Hillary said all of the opposite she said all of the opposite those were pretty pretty solid campaign promises how about the slogans the slogans tell us quite a lot Hillary Clinton's slogan was I'm with her the subject of course being me this little peon is dependent American and I'm with her her wonderfulness Donald Trump's was I'm with you the subject is Donald Trump and you were the American people it uh Turley inverted Hillary's awful idea that she was going to be coronated she was going to become the leader of the country he said no I will be a public servant I work for you I serve you I am with you and if you don't like that then you can throw me out next time Hillary Clinton's other slogans were stronger together which sounded very vicious stick to me if ever you know it's like a bundle of sticks stronger together she's gonna whack us on the head with it another one was fighting for us that one particularly scared me cuz I wondered who us is it seemed to me that if she's fighting for us than she was fighting against them and as a conservative American whose deplorable and irredeemable probably she's fighting against me that's not very good at all I do and then the other slogan was love Trump's hate which I never understood because that sounds like a pro Trump slogan but it's love Trump's hate we're gonna Trump from from Trump you know but Hillary's never been a wonderful candidate or terribly competent at running campaigns or federal agencies more on that later Donald Trump's other slogans other than I'm with you we're all basically variations on make America great again now you might say oh that's so so I don't but so blunt it so bless oh no that's that's a beautiful sentiment make America great again we want to make our country great again there's a reason that it's a great slogan and there's a reason that candidates have used it over time Donald Trump borrowed it from Ronald Reagan though there was a these are different men these were different times so Ronald Reagan's was let let's make America great again and then in in Trump's own trumpian way he turned that into the second person indicative and he said make America great again we're gonna do it you know but those are those are two big differences and so that logic prevailed on me in 2012 I was not initially a Trump supporter I didn't like his campaign very much I supported Ted Cruz I did a TV commercial for Ted Cruz i I thought he would be a better candidate I thought there were decent arguments against Donald Trump but ultimately there was a choice Donald J Trump or Hillary Clinton and all her evil works and all her empty promises that was the choice those were the choices before us and there was a third choice which was chosen by the so called never Trump errs and that third choice was to throw up our hands and say I I just can't stomach it I don't want to do it you can't make me vote for either of these people the never Trump movement made one good argument I felt they made a lot of different arguments but I thought one of them was actually sort of compelling which is that Donald Trump was secretly a Democrat and there was pretty good evidence for this he is a New Yorker he's donated to a lot of Democrats he's ostensibly voted for Democrats before and when he flirted with running for the rule party nomination in 2000 he said very Democrat things he said he's very very pro-choice you know there are a lot of warning signs here so the never Trump argument was then not only is he a Democrat if he gets elected he's going to govern like a Democrat and that won't just be bad it will be disastrous because it will hollow out the Republican Party and make it a vessel of leftism will be much worse off even than we would be under Hillary Clinton this I didn't think was terribly convincing because even if Donald Trump governed as a Democrat he he just couldn't be as bad as Hillary Hillary Clinton is singularly awful she is just you know by the way she's my fourth cousin twice removed I believe I there is a relation that I have D Laurie Clinton and it pains me to say this about my family but she's really singularly awful she lies effortlessly you using her husband's sex scandals is the best probably the clearest example this she lied effortlessly for her husband in the 1990s she smeared his victims she was put in charge of the so-called bimbo eruptions she said that this every scandal that the Clintons were involved in was a vast right-wing conspiracy lied lied and lied and she's wanted to move the u.s. to the far left since her days of writing love letters to Saul Alinsky love letters which you can read you know this was a character argument against Hillary and against throwing my hands up in the air another argument is that she is totally incompetent everything the woman touches turns to ash she's had a terrible career in public service Hillary Kerry in the 1990s was the first time we met her she was put in charge of her husband's health care reform and it uh Turley failed it didn't go anywhere then as she was Secretary of State and one of her first acts as Secretary of State was to create a reset to reset Russian relations between the United States and Russia in a rebuke to the Bush administration so what does she do she does this big press conference she gets a button you know like one of those buttons they have it staples and it's supposed to say reset and one word one word in Russian and she misspelled the word so her silver counterpart her Russian counterpart seized on this pointed out that she couldn't even spell one word right humiliated her and by association in the United States on enduring this international press conference very frustrating she advocated basically disastrous intervention into Libya in 2011 this led almost directly to her incompetence during the Benghazi consulate attack later that year the Benghazi or pardon me in twenty twenty twelve this was the first time an ambassador had been killed since in nineteen seventy nine since another failed Democrat administration and what was so I mean it was an awful incident all around what made it even worse is that she covered it up she covered it up as quickly as she could she said oh this was because of a spontaneous uprising to a YouTube video the administration allowed this line to persist even though we know from some of her emails that we've seen that she admitted almost immediately that this was a terrorist attack in private emails we didn't get to read all of those emails of course because she bleached her email server to cover up her own coverup she destroyed federal records so that's the incompetence she's just a terrible candidate and she's a bad candidate because she hates her fellow countrymen and she thinks they're deplorable and she thinks they're irredeemable we haven't even gotten to the policy argument against Hillary Clinton yet we haven't even gone to the policy argument of why to vote for Donald Trump I'll just go down the list I went to her campaign website is still archived by the way and some of those are hilarious if you have a few moments I recommend looking through it just just a few things what did she want to do just write down the list raise taxes waste money got the First Amendment gut due process for college students she wanted to derail the United States economy at the altar of global warning warming for dubious environmental gains she wanted to let some criminals out of jail got the second amendment entrench Obamacare and force Americans to purchase a product from a private company she wanted to subsidize bad housing loans she wanted to grant amnesty to illegal aliens she wanted to expand the already gigantic blow bureaucracy kickbacks to teachers unions she wanted to gut religious liberty she wanted to subsidize even more college debt and the college tuition bubble she wanted to have a little race hustling mixed in there she wanted to expand welfare in entitlements she wanted to oppose the ability to protect our own elections by presenting an identification card she wanted a little bit more financial regulation and taxpayer subsidized abortion that's that was that was just her policy page on the website just reading from her own campaign in the face of that the argument not to vote for either candidate fell flat to abdicate ones hard-won responsibilities and rights to vote fell totally flat and I think this is a tendency of conservatives in particular a conservatives in particular have this temptation toward rationalism a little temptation toward ideology Michael Oakshott writes about this the palabra dish political philosopher in rationalism and politics he says that the rationalist is one who is he's always standing for something and you heard this from some of trumps critics on the right during the campaign well I stand for Liberty so I can't vote for Trump I stand for equality so I can I stamp standing there always standing and they're never doing anything they're never moving or walking or do they're just standing is it as though there were it required courage to stand or you know to bravery to stand the conservative is one who always prefers the practical to the theoretical some of the Trump critics on the right some of the conservative Trump critics even today you can say hey you know look at all this good stuff that Trump got us look at how good he's been and they'll say yeah sure sure sure I get the Trump works in practice but does he work in theory does he work it come on man is he an intellectual so you could I can't so in the audience said no we'll get to that a bit later too because I think there's quite quite a lot of evidence that he is rather smart so you could risk that Donald J Trump was gonna govern half as a Democrat but he couldn't be he couldn't be worse than Hillary Clinton all of the other conservative arguments against Donald Trump basically boiled down to his lack of couthe Ness it wasn't very coos you know he didn't hold his shorten a glass by the stem he would hold it by the bowl and it would you know the Chevy would get very warm and this was just totally unacceptable and he talked rough he still talks rough and this didn't bother me terribly much I don't like it I like when people speak politely and in a civilized way but you know I'm from New York people talk that way it doesn't shock me I don't clutch my pearls or anything like that Donald Trump also said unchivalrous things about women to put it in a mild and diplomatic way he did do that map that did bother me but then again Hillary Clinton has slandered the victims of her rapists husband so I you know Donald Trump says some mean things about women Bill Clinton turns them into human humidors in the Oval Office and Democrats wanted to put that man back in the White House and his enabler there as well probably not a good idea and there were times when Donald Trump seemed less than knowledgeable about certain matters of public policy and foreign policy and that's true I grant that entirely but Hillary Clinton in her roles in public office and in foreign policy and in domestic policy bungled up everything terribly she was an utter failure in office so that Donald Trump if if he's not as knowledgeable as Hillary Clinton that's fine by me that knowledge hasn't served her terribly well so I voted for Donald Trump that was my decision and I'm very glad that I did I'm very glad that I voted for Donald Trump I was very hesitant I was so nervous I was shaking as I was wearing my little you know American flag shorts to the polling booth is I don't know can I really do this and I did and it felt great because the policy victories immediately started to roll in I I did think he would govern half as a Democrat I was so pleasantly surprised on election night everybody was surprised when he won you know certainly Hillary Clinton was surprised for anyone I don't know if you were watching the victory party in Brooklyn and so Hillary Clinton she didn't show up you know Hillary Clinton the phone will ring at 3:00 in the morning and I'll show up except I won't except when it matters you know as she was probably throwing like desk lamps or something in her hotel suite and she didn't show up instead her campaign manager and Sworcery cooking aficionado John Podesta showed up and he walked on stage and he said thank you all for being here thank you hey Hillary thanks you you know you're here for her and Hillary she's always been here for you except right now the only time that it matters when she is nowhere to be found so I I felt pretty good about that and then Donald Trump became president the transition went in he started to appoint people and public policy started to roll out immediately my fears subsided I learned to stop worrying and love the dog it worked out very very well and that takes care of 2016 this brings us to 2020 the reasons to vote for Trump in 2020 the Donald Trump is governed in a more conservative way than basically any president in modern history totally unexpectedly the Heritage Foundation admits this the Heritage Foundation says that Donald Trump is enacting of their conservative agenda at a faster rate even than Ronald Reagan now you might say Reagan had a Democrat Congress Donald Trump apparently has everybody against him every a lot of collusion you know to take out Donald Trump but we got a wonderful Supreme Court justice everyone on both sides of the aisle said there's no way he'll appoint an originalist to the Supreme Court he appointed like Scalia jr. you know a thinner Scalia more petite Scalia but a very but the brain was still there we got massive deregulation particularly at the EPA we got a major tax reform bill that which was no easy feat we got a decent foreign policy we got a foreign policy that was robust that put American strength first not to be bellicose not to start Wars unnecessarily but because peace comes through strength and chaos and war comes through weakness and Donald Trump knew this we've had the renegotiation of trade deals which some of the free traders worry about but let's not forget we've had to rein in some bad actors China is violating World Trade Organization treaties they're stealing our intellectual property they're illegally subsidizing the steel and aluminium industries and when we have to take a stand against that the even the property theft alone would would say we need to take a stronger stand Republican candidates have been talking about this for years Donald Trump finally did something about it on Obamacare the Republicans failed to repeal Obamacare they've been talking about it since the minute Barack Obama was elected and then they had the opportunity they couldn't do it but even in that case Donald Trump managed to sneak in repeal of the funding mechanism of Obamacare the individual mandate he just snuck it into tax reform which accelerated that death spiral tremendously and it put it on a collision course so even in that failure it turned out not so bad he also pulled us out of the absurd Paris climate Accord the Paris climate Accord that really wouldn't have done much one way or the other but which in it was mostly virtue signaling for totally dubious totally unproven environmental and economic benefits and he hasn't granted amnesty to illegal aliens yet which would as democrat strategists have written publicly in memoranda would be a path to electoral dominance for democrats he still hasn't done that that's pretty good first year that's not a stupid argument for 2020 how about the temperament the hysterical left the more more hysterical than usual left has been telling us that Donald Trump's temperament is going to send us careening into World War 3 and into nuclear holocaust and he's you know he's got the button and it's all gonna go crazy and what have we seen this week that after 70 years of war and possible nuclear strikes Donald J Trump may bring peace to the Korean Peninsula I did not think that I would ever utter that statement but apparently is the case but both sides are going to the negotiating table they've taken away the precondition that America must pull its troops out of Korea he's actually doing a pretty good job on that front and maintaining the world order he's done a good job at punishing people who violate international norms and the policy in the United States in the international community he's done that in Syria now it's all in all pretty good it turns out this is where I'd like to address the idea that Donald Trump is an idiot because that's that's the meme is they did this to Bush too they did the same thing to george w bush and you saw it a one-time Christopher Hitchens talked to Bill Maher about this and you know Bill Maher made some joke about how Bush was an idiot and he said you know that's the joke that stupid people laugh at that's the joke anybody can make that joke it's so easy to make I will pause it for you that a guy who has had perhaps the most successful first year of any president of either party actually but certainly of a conservative president recently a guy who's reached the absolute pinnacle of some of the most competitive industries in the world including New York real estate Manhattan real estate gambling network television where he sat on top numero uno for 15 consecutive seasons network TV and the first time he ran for anything was elected to the highest political office in the history of the world maybe that guy's not a total idiot you know maybe he's not totally incompetent he's either is maybe smarter than the average slob or he is the single luckiest human being in the history of the world either way I would be happy to have that guy as my president that's not not too bad another aspect of Donald Trump that I think worked some conservatives but probably as to our ultimate benefit is his pragmatism he doesn't appear to be terribly ideologically conservative you know he doesn't go to ISI lunches or the Heritage Foundation you know and discuss the inner workings of entitlement reform or anything like that he's he's quite pragmatic and this this was very important on on a touchy issue that Barack Obama totally invented which is the transgender bathroom controversy of the last five years you know that the most important issue facing our country we've got nuclear weapons in Korea no we got to talk about that five people on planet Earth who are confused about their biological sex Barack Obama honed in on this issue he just I think he's of his last year he must have spent 90% of the time talking about why we need to let men use the women's room and women use the men's room and this was an issue of natural rights and human dignity or whatever Donald Trump comes in there and he said you know a small number of people have been confused about their biological sex since ever since the dawn of time and they've all gone to the bathroom fine and this is an affair been an issue that I worried about and so let's just do that just keep that sounds fine and it totally quashed that issue now some of the social conservatives wanted to say no but you've got to rub it in their face about biology identities no this doesn't this is not a thing this is not an issue to worry about calm down despite the constant negative press cough FA keep calm and make America great again this this pragmatism is an important aspect it can really quell cultural battles so this brings me to I think the most important reason to vote for Donald beyond the the salty delicious leftist ears the the most important reason to vote for Donald Trump in 2016 or 2020 is that it shows that America still has a little bit of life left in it it still has a little vigor it still has a little recklessness it still has spirit and life and ethos to it you know the the kind of soulless March tiresome unpleasant slog toward progress with a capital P and a little trademark afterward it made it clear what had to happen Hillary Clinton had to become president notes person other than Hillary Clinton probably including her husband wanted this woman to be in the White House but that was progress we have to do we're gonna have eight years of Obama then we're gonna have eight years of Hillary Clinton and then we're gonna have eight years of I don't know Tim Kaine the second woman president and then we're gonna have maybe I don't know maybe we'll have a bush maybe that you can throw a bush in there somewhere for a little bit but certainly never array again we're not getting any more Reagan's and certainly never Donald Trump ain't gonna happen and do you know what the American people said do all that they say they had two words and it wasn't happy birthday and it wasn't Hillary Clinton they said no way pal because a central question of this was PC was political correctness how could you vote for him it's so politically incorrect he's so icky it's just not done he talks play mainly he usually means what he says actually you know the GOP would always pay lip service to things like not ranting amnesty for instance and but then they'd go and try to craft all of these amnesty bills behind everyone's back they say look we have to we have to do what are we gonna do not grant them ham that's what you're gonna don't grant them amnesty no what are we gonna do we have to do you just said you weren't gonna and Donald Trump goes in and then he doesn't grant amnesty and he's still trying to build that wall we'll see how that goes but he actually appears to mean what he says you know if if people start to get silly ideas in America like you know we're not gonna just go along with that we're not gonna just elect Clinton because you people on TV tell me to the mainstream media unites to shut people down the mainstream media big corporations big technology they unite to shut people down if you are not ideologically uniformed that is it if you if you do make it to Facebook or YouTube or Twitter you know cuz you can't get on the mainstream media what will happen is they'll censor you or they'll ban you or there's they'll shadow ban you or they'll censor all of your videos on YouTube or if you work for Google they'll fire you like it happened to James d'amour or if you hold a political view that was the consensus political view even a few years earlier on the question of gay marriage and then that political view becomes unfashionable you will lose your company has happened to Brandon Ike at Mozilla comply comply comply that is what an oppressive corrosive awful censorious intersectional culture of leftism tells us to do in 2018 and Donald Trump said no Donald Trump said I'm not going to do that one one of the moments that Donald Trump had with the media that actually started to win me over to him that made me think oh maybe this guy knows what he's doing is Donald Trump use the term anchor baby you know people who come here and they have a baby and then they that baby has American citizenship and you can bring the whole family he used the term anchor baby and the the reporter said don't you know that that term is offensive said how's that offensive what's what's it or donate is it so offensive so Trump says well what would you like you to say said you know you should call them future dreamin undocumented flag-waving dreaming baby tax pay whatever you know and Trump cuts him off and says yeah I think I'm gonna keep using anchor baby yeah yeah I think that's just fine I think that works just was so beautiful it's so highlighted that the absurdity of that oppressive culture that none of us really believes none of us really take seriously but we all feel that we have to comply he knocked that down he's a cultural warrior and for even people on the right some stealth self-styled sophisticated conservatives they're offended by this you know the type who they're Ivy league-educated they they wear bowties on days that are not their wedding they they they have opinions about pate and you know you certainly know the difference between chef Lee and something you'll belong there's no question about that you know unless and I'm describing myself too I do all these sorts that I have a very similar bowtie but but more but more importantly than all that because that I can get behind it I have a lot of opinions about pate but more than that what these people want and what what separates them is they just want to be thought of as intellectual and sophisticated by the self-appointed elites who have no business calling themselves elites at the New York Times they just want to appear intellectual and sophisticated that you know they write for the New York Times they're people they say I'm a Republican but I'm not that kind of Republican please like me like me you know I that is what I call I call them Republican but not that kind of Republicans that's they're they're so afraid they're they they feel that they have much more in common with people at the New York Times in the Washington Post and their agenda basically is we need to lower taxes and we need to reform entitlements and deregulate a little bit but not too much and it's basically an agenda of bean-counting I'm not opposed to those things I like those things a lot I like lower taxes I want to reform entitlements I like all of those things but they must be grounded in cultural questions politics is downstream of culture as Andrew Breitbart was fond of saying even questions like tax reform are ultimately cultural questions what what money is how property relates to us in this society how we view ourselves in the unity of our lives in our relationship to our countrymen these are these are cultural battles in all real political battles or cultural battles cultural battle is the only way to crack a corrupt and divisive awful leftism that is not going to be pretty that is not going to be easy it's going to involve people who use huge words and say you know rough things a lot Lord Acton's said this very well I'm gonna say it poorly cuz I'm paraphrasing him but he said it very well which is that at all time at all times the Friends of Liberty had been few and they've achieved what they have achieved by associating with auxiliaries whose goals often differ from their own and this involves a lot of risk and a lot of moral risk because when those auxiliaries do bad things we feel that we're a part of that but it is the only way to accomplish any actual goal in politics because we live in the real world in time and space if we want responsible government we must behave like adults and and make responsible choices the left is going to throw everything they can at this guy the Russia stuff and you know the disgruntled FBI director that all the Democrats used to say was the worst person ever born on earth and now they say he's like st. James st. James Comey you know they'll throw slander and libel and porn stars at him and we need to rise above that and behave like adults not like children that we need to recognize that we have to win real victories in time and space we have to take the victories that we can get when we can get them and say you know I'm not I'm not gonna vote for Trump because maybe like in 20 years we'll get a conservative candidate that I like a little bit more and so we'll just wait and you can't wait you have to be a like an adult and make a morally responsible decision we must despite the constant negative press coffe FA we need to ignore that negative press we need to embrace that exuberance and that reality of this moment the left simply wants to destroy and deconstruct and divide and divide and divide and attack and what we must do is build our culture and politics back up we must build and we must make we have to build on the victory of 2016 we have to build on it in 2018 we have to build on it in 2020 and we must make America great again and again and again and again and again thank you very much you're up we're going to advance to the Q&A so I mean you can stay right here okay I just need you you have very good PowerPoint skills I know like this I know all right all right that's saying there we go all right we're starting the Q&A so raise your hands and I will come around to you I'm so glad to get a chance to speak to everyone here for the first time no I'll seriously take two seconds but I have to make sure that these questions are asked of you they're the most important ones and then I'll let them all put you to the fire all right do you really have a $400 bet with Ben that Trump would win in 2016 well no I had a $100 bet with Ben and he gave me odds because he was so confident and then when President cough FA did make it across the finish line I had to shake him down by his ankles and I now have it framed on I said every single day it's a beautiful thing fantastic continuing with the speed round what is your myers-briggs personality type I did I took one of these I am an e in t J I think I guessed it right it's on the paper and you'll you'll see it yeah right now what's my horoscope sign what's my ride you know Mercury's in retrograde what do you know talk about it later those don't exist was it scary hosting Jordan V Peterson on your show and did you clean your room afterwards I never cleaned my room though I do like Jordan very much what was difficult with Jordan is it's very difficult to get Jordan to laugh and I have made it a mission in life to make Jordan Pederson laugh and I got like half of a chuckle once which I took is a great victory but that can be a little intimidating you're trying to tell jokes and he's just like yes Michael I know you haven't be like a lobster yeah you often mentioned your lovely little ELISA on your podcast how do you annoy her most and how do you make up for it well I think that probably contributes to annoying her most you know constantly referring to sweet little at lease on the podcast she's not a big fan of the cigars and I smoke about 150,000 cigars per day but you know sweet little ELISA is like a true Saint into martyr and she's taken it upon herself to try to make me live you know for a little bit longer in this world pull me out of the gutter you know just there slobbering to myself in booze and and so I think she takes that suffering as a sanctifying experience and finally what color is calf FA oh that's an excellent question but if you don't know I couldn't possibly tell you sorry I was hoping you would reveal yourself that's all right thank you you mentioned earlier Bill Clinton and you mentioned that Bill Clinton was a rapist and I think I I'm not saying he's not and I think that you drew an equivalence between Bill Clinton and Donald Trump have you considered maybe they are both very bad well I certainly compared the two men I I've spoken to one of Bill Clinton's victims I've spoken to wanita Broderick at length and I believe her I do this is not to say there can be plenty of false accusations people do it all the time there have been many of these instances on college campuses in the last five years but I believe Juanita Broderick and I've seen a lot of scandals and made ginned up scandals around Donald Trump does Donald Trump have a none chivalrous way with women I don't think anyone on planet earth would disagree with that but I haven't seen I haven't seen accusations this with the seriousness and persistence of those accusations against Bill Clinton and the ways in which he did it in the places in which he did it in the abuses of power that were involved in his doing it and the abuses of the public trust that were entailed in Bill Clinton's exploits I haven't seen any of that with Donald Trump that's not to say that Donald Trump is a monk or a saint or you know even a well-behaved guy when it comes to those sorts of things but I don't think they're on the same level I don't see evidence of that if someone presented me evidence with that I would I would consider it hi so given the success that Trump has had on social media in the 2016 campaign and now with all the scrutiny on these platforms how do you see the online landscape changing in terms of the 2018 and even 2020 campaigns they're trying to shut us down that is what is happening the mainstream media were able to shut conservatives out for 70 years they were able to kick us off of television Buddhist out of Hollywood studios and finally the internet happened and we killed it man the Conservatives are so much better at the internet we're bigger faster funnier it is all the good memes or conservatives the blank book thing happened because conservatives are very clever online it's not me I told a very simple joke and then all of these conservatives started leaving 10 paragraph reviews citing Sophocles and Thucydides and it's very very funny the wit is all there and conservatives have used social media very effectively since the beginning Donald Trump used it much better than Hillary Clinton did by the way when Barack Obama was perhaps miss using data on Facebook and at a much higher rate by the way then this mostly made up Cambridge analytical scandal when Barack Obama was stealing the data or using the data without consent of a hundred ninety million Americans compared to at high estimates 70 to 80 million Americans has happened with Cambridge analytic for a variety of other candidates when Obama did that the mainstream media said he's the digital candidate he's the candidate of youth good for him what a genius and the Obama campaign by the way admitted that came out they said using data from Facebook without people's consent was a game changer it was the most important technology we used in that campaign and the media they celebrated it then Donald Trump gets good at social media and it is a crime with testimony and investigations and wailing and gnashing of teeth it's absurd and they're they're out for blood this is why they're dragging mark zuckerberg over this complete non traversée this ridiculous made-up scandal they're dragging him here because conservatives used it to win they're going to keep trying to censor us they censor many of my videos if not most of them on YouTube because I'm such an intimidating guy as you can tell they to ban conservatives we've seen that on tape they've admitted to it and they're going to keep doing it and then we're gonna have to find another venue because their first instinct is to censor and ours is to let freedom reign because that we know in a free exchange of ideas we're gonna win Thanks hey Michael lucky show thanks what's the risk of Trump being primary by say like a flake or a corker in 2020 well our flake and cork are gonna run in the Democrat primary they're gonna run in the Republican primary all day all I ever see from those guys is them complaining about and criticizing Republicans with Republicans like them who needs Democrats I don't think they pose any threat whatsoever if there were a serious politician a respectable conviction candidate somebody like Ted Cruz for example to primary Donald Trump I think you'd have some trouble there because because you have a conviction you have something you believe but if it's just whiny little opportunists who are upset that the president was mean to them and they might not win re-election I don't think they'll pose any threat at all in your lecture you mentioned Trump's non interventionist foreign policy promises last week we saw the serious strike do you see that as Trump reneging on his promises and what do you think implications of that straight car like just for foreign policy in general I don't think it's reneging on his promises because I don't think he promised non intervention or isolation conservatives we want to be so extreme we want it one way or the other we either want to bomb every country on earth or we want to you know retreat into our bunkers and eat meals ready to eat and just keep our guns by our pillows or something and I think Donald Trump being pragmatic and being a pragmatist says we are going to intervene in some cases when the costs are relatively low and the benefits are relatively better you know the art of the deal when it involves shooting missiles into Syria and and in other cases we're not going to do that and we're going to try to have strategic goals so with Barack Obama he invented red lines out of whole cloth and then what was so awful about that regardless of what you think about intervening in the Syrian civil war is that he refused to back up his words so the credibility of the United States looked like it was worthless and here fortunately with Donald Trump we have him backing up American credibility abroad but without a terrible cost so we say these weapons are prohibited they violate international Norm's they violate the policy of the United States we're not going to permit that it looks to me if I had to guess like a foreign policy of mowing the lawn we don't have to go and invade every country on earth but when those weeds get a little high you've gotta mow them with some cruise missiles or something like that that seems perfectly fine people caricature Trump's national security adviser John Bolton a very brilliant man they try to caricature him as someone who all he wants to do is bomb everyone else in the world but ambassador Bolton has been fairly clear about Syria and said Syria's not the strategic central question to the world order or in American foreign policy there are other places and we need to balance the risks and rewards as they come that's not a clear foreign policy that isn't all one way or the other but as dr. Johnson pointed out all shallows are clear thank you for your show awesome big fan thank you very much especially it's a nice break from been show Ben you know he talks like 400 words a minute so I have to buy you four other podcasts I speed them up 2x and for Ben I slow it down slow it down 50% yeah yeah I finally get a little angry like I love Ben he's awesome guy but like he's just so serious so like watching a show where you laugh and Clavin show too is nice change you gotta listen to bands first because you'll get like all the news and you'll just think like this world is about doing then hopefully it gets a little lighter FFA yeah so for my question so I saw Andrew Andrews talk at at ut-austin and he talked a lot about the culture and talked a lot about how there are a lot of questions about how you know conservatives can kind of infiltrate the culture and the media and you know create art that the the changes society that changes the culture and I think over these past you know 10 years there's been a radical change and you know now you have people like crowd or you have see our TV you have the Daily wire where people are just creating a lot of great content so you know moving ahead where do you you know and you know someone who has a background in theater where do you see those big cultural changes on the right you know happening in terms of in terms of art in terms of media in terms of yeah I guess just I guess just changing that change changing the culture and changing it to affect politics it's very heartening because as a conservative who's you know I've been in lots of like I won't even call them c-list films I'll call them like H List films you know that air on channel 3000 at 2:00 in the morning or something but as a result of that I've been around a lot of conservatives in show business in New York and Hollywood and we're a you know much believer group not just because it's difficult and conservatives get blacklisted from the major studios and the major programs in the major publishing institutions but because conservatives themselves don't want to consume the culture of drew points this out a lot that conservatives are often Philistines and they don't want to read novels and they don't want to listen to audiobooks and they don't want to go see the movies so one aspect of hope you bring up crowd or you bring up all of these podcasts these guys are breaking through crowd or would never be hired by Saturday Night Live right Crider wouldn't it they wouldn't put them on The Daily Show even though he's way funnier than any of those guys yeah but they wouldn't they refuse to do that because the left gets so complacent it's the same thing as being a conservative in a left-wing culture on campus it makes you much smarter it makes you have better arguments because you constantly have to defend what you think and refine what you think because maybe the 97% of lefties around you on campus or in Hollywood or in New York they'll point some out a flaw in your argument and then you'll have a stronger argument you'll find out what you really believe they never have that opportunity so what the left is doing is they're using all the old technology they're fighting the last war they got so complacent that they you know they make big movies and that don't make any money of course but they still make them somehow and TV and that publishing and blah blah blah but conservatives we've been forced to innovate so we're much sharper on the Internet we're we're making shows and programs for written shoestring budgets my own little plug is I did a narrative podcast with Andrew Clavin which is he wrote a story called another Kingdom and I formed all of the roles and I can attest that it was a shoestring budget unfortunately very very shoestring but as a result we were able to put out a very popular piece of conservative culture for relatively nothing those gatekeepers can't hold us back anymore and it's the the place you will find it is where the gatekeepers haven't shown up yet and our goal is we have to keep those gatekeepers away as long as we can and then we'll move on to something else absolutely not yeah you bet awesome so do you see that as more you know right now that obviously there's a lot of subscription-based you know sites like the blaze and CR TV and and you know daily wire do you see it more as following in that subscription model do you think that there's gonna be you know I might hear people talk about a platform to rival YouTube or something like that you know do you think it's gonna consolidate you I mean do you have any thoughts on that it would be hard for conservatives to make our on YouTube I wish we would do it I think it would be great because they wouldn't censor my videos where I talk to authors or whatever and they say this is too dangerous they wouldn't censor Dennis Prager explaining why you shouldn't murder people do not murder that was censored by YouTube because Dennis Prager was explaining a commandment so I would prefer that I suspect it would it would ghettoize us I suspect the people who are politically tuned in and really view things in a philosophical or ideological way there aren't that many of us and of conservatives that were probably half of those people and it would just probably not work the reason that YouTube works is that everybody's on YouTube the reason the Twitter works is that everybody is on Twitter even though they keep kicking all of us off Twitter but there's still a lot of people there I suspect that unfortunately won't happen so I think what we have to do is be the subversive ones we in the culture now we on the right are the subversive ones the stodgy old decrepit corrupt establishment is a left-wing establishment we get to subvert and I think we should subvert on their own platforms and I think we should keep doing it and doing it until another one pops up and I don't think we should cede that field to them at all and try to get a whys ourselves we've got to crack it from within thank you so what about the wall are you telling me you're telling me man I it's been a little I you don't want the wall you you you do want that I want the wall to I know we need to do the wall there it's it's become very frustrating because this seems like a simple enough matter doesn't it but it's going to be held up forever it and that shows us two things it shows us one how people on the right and Republicans usually don't really mean what they say they say one thing they say we're gonna repeal Obamacare repeal Obamacare repeal Obamacare and then it's okay now you can do it so what I did I didn't say I wanted to repeal Obamacare I you know I thought and we're seeing this a little bit on the wall too what it also shows us is that the federal bureaucracy is far too large and has far too much power I had the privilege of speaking with Justice Scalia twice before he died and we asked him what the greatest threat to the Republicans and threat to American liberty he said it's the unaccountable bureaucracy that can hold up the wall construction because of you know the spotted salamander that hops across the Rio Grande and that's why we can't protect our sovereign country and we can't enforce democratically enacted immigration laws nevertheless I think we're going to keep pushing here and one aspect of Donald Trump that I really took me a while to appreciate is that he makes these outrageous claims or he pushes very very far to push you beyond the sale Scott Adams the Dilbert guy brought my attention to this that he'll say you know we're gonna build the wall in Mexico is gonna pay for it and then all of a sudden everyone's arguing about who's gonna pay for the wall but you've already accepted the premise that we're going to have a wall right that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago so I I am holding out some hope for the art of the deal and maybe in my glass-half-full way Donald Trump is saving the wall so that we have to reelect him knock on wood I'm I'm unfortunately skeptical you know what a trust but verify was Reagan's line and but but hopefully it will happen eventually because it's important symbolically and it's um Fortin practically walzwerk there are walls all around this building there are walls in this in this classroom and we ought to have walls to protect our country as well as you can tell by my accent and when I came here 20 years ago it was a complete complete shock to me that leftist idea are very popular here and left is basically poisoning kids in schools and colleges and you mentioned in his Prager and he saved me after Obama was elected second time he was talking about five stages of grief and it was exactly I composed my experience so anyway my question is what is your opinion about conservative radio and also I would recommend all young people to listen to conservative radio and who's your favorite talk show host I there are too many to count Russia's the original one but I thank you so much for mentioning that that you're from the Soviet Union and you're horrified by the evils of leftism and of totalitarianism because I didn't live in the Soviet Union for ever but I I did visit Cuba briefly over the summer and the first thing I noticed there is that people don't wear che guevara t-shirts in Cuba the Cubans don't wear them white liberals wear them in the United States white useful idiots in America wear Che Guevara t-shirts because they don't know the horrors of enslavement and property confiscation and physically being brutalized by the government they don't know what that's like they they they would deny I think the reality of those things what they wear in Cuba are American flags I saw it a dozen times in just a few days sewn onto jeans on their little bicycles I'm the few meager pieces of property that they're allowed to have without it being confiscated it's so important and this this your point on conservative talk radio gets back to something that I brought up a little earlier you know I love Dennis Prager Dennis is my cigar buddy we're very fortunate to have them in Los Angeles and sometimes these sophisticates the academic types they say oh how can you listen to conservative talk radio they take complex ideas and boil them down and make so simple dennis prager is a very very intelligent guy and he has an amazing gift to boil down complex things and go piece by piece and make them digestible to a mass audience that is a wonderful thing there should be no snobbishness here there should be no nose in the air you know trying to sip your Shepley or something like that these are real problems and I fear that people who grew up in privilege ironically it's all the people yelling at us about our privilege that are the ones that have had privilege destroy their minds and distort their vision people who have grown up in privilege they don't understand what how brutal the conclusion of leftist ideas can really be and I hope that conservative talk radio helps but I also hope that people like you who have seen it firsthand who have experienced it that can can talk up and tell them what you've seen and explain reality to these people it's it's a very important thing and it's a it's an irony and they don't understand literally it's not just making people poor just social skills it does utopia kills people think utopia means the best place that's what they think the word means it doesn't it means no place that's what the word means no place it doesn't exist it's a fantasy in Democrat politicians used to frequently quote a line from George Bernard Shaw they would say some people see things that are and ask why but I dream things that never were and ask why not and they say this as though it's some uplifting inspirational quote what they fail to mention because they don't read beyond the quote book is that it wasn't George Bernard Shaw who said that it was George Bernard Shaw writing in the mouth of the serpent tempting Eve in the play back to Methuselah those are the words of the devil and that that utopian vision it leads to very very dark places we've seen it for so long well over a century and unfortunately people seem to forget and what is that they tell you when you forget history and you don't learn from the past you're doomed to repeat it sadly hi Michael um how much um how much would you estimate that the deef state has over the u.s. domestic and foreign policy right now given the raid on trump's office in his personal term so to use the term because I I think a lot of conservatives they they think that we're talking about some crazy conspiracy thing when we use the term of the deep state all the deep state means is the entrenched bureaucracy that has no democratic accountability we the people have not put them there they're the lifers in DC who construct an inordinate amount of our public policy and really have an inordinate impact on our political lives and the way that we're governed the deep state or the federal bureaucracy has grown so enormous Lee you don't even need to see the Intel and the intelligence agencies are a part of that you know it's funny because people have these images of like all of the all of government is just this awful Bureau where people like aren't that efficient and they always bungle things but then they have this image of the CIA or something it's this amazingly effective organize our whatever you know and look these are wonderful organizations that can keep us safe but it is the government we are talking about the government here it has a hugely outsized role of Public Policy I don't think that you need to look at the raid on Michael Cohen's a lawyer to see that though certainly that could alert one just to a problem I think what you have to see is agencies invalidating Trump federal policies I think you need to see agencies saying no no sorry people of America sorry duly elected representatives were the benevolent betters and we're going to tell you how to run your lives better than you can that to me throws up warning flags perhaps think you know when the agencies are coming after the duly elected president when Bill Kristol a leader for a long time of the conservative movement says between the Trump state that is the elected sovereign state and the deep state or the bureaucracy I choose the deep state when you have people saying that that is a terrifying place in the country and so perhaps that calls our attention to it but I am grateful for those ray if it can call people's attention to how we have to shrink that headless godless unaccountable bureaucracy that's to me like a percentage I don't know I mean it's hard to quantify that right I mean one one special council investigation is is worth quite a lot as a broader sense of the country as a whole like over the past like 20 years I think it's been growing for about a century I think the administrative state has ballooned and ballooned I'm sorry to say that it was Republicans who invented the income tax and the IRS it happened with Abraham Lincoln and it happened with William Howard Taft and but agencies have ballooned and ballooned and ballooned and they can ruin you they can forget even Donald Trump or the intelligence agencies or or the the things that kind of make splashy headlines on the Internet they can just ruin you Dinesh D'Souza donated a little bit too much money to a state candidate to a candidate for Senate in New York who by the way was never going to win I was working elections at the time of that race it was just a nice thing for a friend and Barack Obama selectively prosecuted him the federal agencies went in there and destroyed this guy's life you saw the IRS targeting conservatives during the Tea Party movement you saw them targeting groups that I am a member of they were targeting that I I'm sorry that I can't give you an exact number because you one of these incidents could be far worse than 99% of them but the the simple answer is it's too much and it's and it has grown and crept over a century in an insidious way and that's why it's gonna take more than one man named Donald Trump to crack that or other conservative activists we have to be relentless in wresting our power back from the government good question all right thank you again so much for coming out I want to ask you a little bit I'm from Michigan and so obviously I am very worried about my friend Tim Allen I'm sure you know his show was cancelled a couple seasons ago after six after six seasons and I wanted to ask you a little bit about what your thoughts are on the future of conservative voice but conservative storylines being told in Hollywood and on a network television I know there's a current one of back-and-forth who hang about going on about Roseanne but I think Tim Allen kind of fell by the wayside you know he had six seasons and his show was about in the top third of brackets about network at the time and it was I don't unexpectedly cancelled he was kind of your thoughts on now what you knew about at the time they don't learn anything what I can tell you just from my brief time in Hollywood as I don't think it's like someone sitting at his chair petting his cat you know thinking hahahaha how can I ruin Tim Allen's life today they they're just a little dim I think they they say okay we're going to whenever they make conservative art it always is great in fact when they make non leftist art it always does really really well and people really really like it Roseanne is a good example of this Roseanne is not a conservative Roseanne you know doesn't doesn't go to the Heritage Foundation or anything like that but it was a non leftist show it's a show that shows America as it is with all of its warts and she says now I'm voting for Trump yeah I really like him and it's done very well and they even controlling for a nostalgia TV or whatever it's blown past anything else but they keep doubling down because they're in such a little cocoon themselves they don't know anyone who voted for Donald Trump they don't know anyone they don't know anyone who watches Tim Allen's show Tim Allen's show is very very popular they don't know anyone who does it it's it's so isolated for them and I pity them for it I really do I pity us a little bit too because it ruins our culture but I pity them because we can see it when a conservative is so beleaguered by the culture constantly the popular culture it becomes a little clearer what works what doesn't work what people want what they don't want but when all you do look Los Angeles is a driving city on you see three people there a day you know you get in your car and then you drive to your network and then you talk to all lefties all day long and that's all you do then maybe you drive to a cocktail party and you see exactly the same people all of whom donated to Hillary Clinton none of whom have ever watched him Allen's show and then you drive home again and you rinse and repeat you just keep doing that on and on and on I wish there were some way to show them I thought that the high ratings for conservative art would do this good war movies you know that show America of good light or television shows that break that narrative but they seem not to get the message they they keep asking Jimmy Kimmel to host the Oscars this year the Oscars were down 20% over a nine year low they'll probably have him do it again next year Jimmy Kimmel gave a joke free monologue this year there were no jokes it was just political diatribes but that's what they've all convinced themselves the sells because it sells with their friends trouble for them as it doesn't sell for the American people and thankfully we have other venues now that might not be network television but we can get the word out and we can get our even our art out as well hi Michael thanks a lot for coming some of the president's biggest supporters maybe we'll call them always Trump errs seem to have this to subscribe to this notion of four dimensional chess that you know this idea that he's five steps ahead of everyone and when he appears to be shooting himself in the foot politically it's actually part of his brilliance master plan now I think on your show you've said that you don't subscribe to this idea but I think it's totally made up I think it's a fiction invented by never Trump errs and I'll clarify that I don't think that Donald Trump is playing 17 dimensional chess and I don't know anybody who thinks that Donald Trump is playing 17 dimensional chess and I know a lot of Donald Trump supporters what we all think is this guy is pretty good at the media that's what we think that is our grand suggestion there is one group that says he's a total dolt in an idiot and just happens to be lucky all the time every single stage of his life every minute of the day and then there's another group that says he's really really good at the media much better not only than other politicians but better than the reporters and the journalists and the TV comedians and all that I think is a perfectly obvious observation and rather than always Trump errs conservative supporters of the president denying his stupidity I think what's really happening is that the never Trump movement made a difficult calculation and they made the wrong calculation and they're trying to justify it by pretending that he's a dolt when it's obvious that he isn't hi how are you so I think you've made a very clear point that unfortunately conservative opinions are being restricted limited shut down however you want to say in universities Hollywood YouTube Twitter so I guess a question I have for you as a frustrated conservative wait where did conservatives go wrong how come the gatekeepers are all liberal like is that a question you ask yourself like or do you just assume that you know in Hollywood there's gonna be this liberal bias YouTube has a liberal bias like why is that a thing clearly the content that conservative culture puts out is like really good content so what why is it always that the gatekeepers have this liberal bias it's because we didn't play 16 DHS and they did to borrow from the last question it's because we seeded the campuses to the left it's because we seeded Hollywood to the left we gave it up we allowed them to take over and so the radicals of the 1960's have become the tenured radicals and the professors of our own era we gave it up and in part this is because artists tend to be on the left this is true throughout history and as an occasional artist myself I'll explain it it's because artists are completely out of their minds they are unmoored they're allergic to getting a paycheck they cannot wake up before 2:00 p.m. you know the song from Pinocchio is right hi diddle dee dee the actor life for me you just kind of walk through life and do it to do to do you know and there is no responsibility and one doesn't do conventional things and so this appeals to lefty this in a way that conservatives think like huh wait I can go to Wall Street and then make all of the money maybe I'll do that yeah that sounds a little better than you know doing some black box play on some godforsaken Boulevard in Los Angeles so that I think there's a temptation in the culture to move to the left I think also the academy by virtue of living a purely intellectual life a life that does not have much practical application also attracts the left because as I mentioned earlier in the remarks conservatives tend to prefer the practical to the purely theoretical we don't say who cares if it works in practice does it work in theory you know we we live in time and space we have bodies we have a soul we have a body and we're a unified person so I think both of those things tend to attract the left and that creates culture the intellectuals on campuses who educate the next generations creating the culture and in Hollywood would they create the popular culture and that's exported around the world there are excellent conservative artists I know many of them but there aren't that many of them and so it's easy to sort of gang up on them especially after a series of legal decisions during the 20th century in Hollywood that basically destroyed the studio system took serious businessmen out of the equation and gave the asylum to the lunatics to run free with the same thing has happened on college campuses at this point the I'll use my own dear old yell as an example here Yale has led the way in campus insanity over the last three years they have been the they've had shrieking girl yelling at professors and saying this isn't about an intellectual space this is about my comfort in my home and what is the administration do they say oh I'm sorry okay whatever you want you okay that's fine darling it's the same thing that that happened in Hollywood we've let the lunatics run the asylum and I think the only way to grab that back is to find those conservative intellectuals to find those conservative artists and using the tools that are now available to us that are now at our disposal that did not exist 20 years ago blasts them out to everybody and hope that conservatives aren't such Philistines that they won't watch cultural hi I go to an all-girls school in New Jersey I'm a junior in high school it's an extremely liberal school and I have friends who openly talk about how they would never talk or associate themselves with people who vote for Trump so I was wondering how you would suggest I get my opinion out there and have a conversation in that kind of environment yeah it's a difficult especially in high school high school is not known for being the most reasonable place on earth you know it's a little clicky and a little catty and so you might be out of luck unfortunately for the the near future but you bring up a great point which is that they'll say I don't know anyone who voted for Trump I won't talk to anyone who voted for Trump I'm gonna unfriend you on Facebook if you voted for Trump and there are studies about this leftists unfriend conservatives and bloc conservatives on social media three times as much as conservatives do that to lefties Jonathan Hite studied this a few years ago and it was even reported in the New York Times which is that conservatives understand the left-wing point of view conservatives understand lefties but lefties don't understand conservatives because conservatives view the world in different categories in in more categories whereas the left has a more narrow view of the world so what I would recommend to you a high school junior we're surrounded by all of these other high school juniors is you've got to treat those little children like children you have to be the adult and you have to treat them like children I don't mean that you have to smack them around and like punch them in the face that is not what good parents generally do they don't like torture their kids but they have to be a little firm they have to be loving they don't love their countrymen on the Left they think their deplorable and you're redeemable but we should love our country I do love my countrymen and I want them to do better and see the world better and have a better life because they look miserable all the time don't they they're shrieking and they're shouting they were those ridiculous hats and they yell profanities all the time and when Donald Trump was elected that woman in the video that was going around and said no it is so delicious I'm sorry I'm getting great getting distracted here we have to we have to do that you you need patience you need a saintly patience and you have to not be afraid unfortunately when you have an environment that toxic when you have a leftist culture that toxic where it's that cultish by the way where they say we won't associate unless you're in our group we won't talk to you that means you're gonna lose friends and that's sad that's a really sad thing but you the truth above all things and I and it's you know you're attending lectures at the University of Pennsylvania as a junior in high school so you're probably a fairly mature yourself and I bet you can handle it so I'm glad you mentioned height because I think you know his stuff is really and if I may just add to you know what you mentioned specifically his researches like the people on the left and the right view the world in term categories in a moral regard right values yeah right in moral intuitions and I think this was a huge like thing for me to come across like fairly recently and there's no way how I view political differences in like the the extent of polarization in our country that like is obviously on display with the last election I'm so I think you know it's pretty clear from you know everything you've said and I think just from being attuned to like the the wrongdoings of the left if you will like you know what kind of reactionary um like well-meaning and like kind of morally like righteous and and well-intentioned like you know behavior of those on the left but now so then like what can what what can conservatives do also like I said on the Left I think people it'd be good if people on the Left we're more tuned to like how conservatives think right and it which is tough when you don't have the same moral intuitions so warrior suggestions for both sides basically to like fix the issue of polarization which is nothing generally bad for everybody I'll go further than moral intuitions they're morally ignorant there is a pervasion of moral ignorance in the West and this is because we have an incoherent moral framework so we talk about values and someone says well I value this and someone says well I value this and I guess well Oh shucks I guess we just well we're just not even communicating with one another are we and it's because in the classical framework there was a good for man it was understood that there are the virtues and there there is virtue and there is the good for man and life has a purpose and life has a coherent narrative to it and that's all been exploded by the by the modern era the last 500 years or so so that now it's not just that the left doesn't understand the right or the right actually does sort of understand the left but not perfectly it's that we're not even talking to each other we're using the same words but they don't mean the same thing we are like bar bar bar bar like you know roving savages or something we're not actually having a conversation and this is because of the shocking degree of ignorance and lack of culture is I don't mean this even in a hyperbolic way people don't read anything and I'm not just talking about everybody I'm not talking about you know the great unwashed masses you know as as people derived their fellow countrymen I'm even talking about the self-appointed elites you can graduate from Yale University with a major in English and not read Shakespeare and not read Shakespeare you can I grow yes I graduated Yale best English department in the country summa laude oh yeah what'd you think of Hamlet huh no I didn't know we didn't do that one we didn't read that that is a horrifying thing and so what is required there is a humility an important virtue is humility but we don't have any humility now we have shout we have pride there are all of these projects for gay pride but all of these other pride marches we have shout your abortion we it's just various displays of yelling and of hubris but really what is required is humility to realize that we don't know very much that our culture has lost something profound and important and if we even want to be able to speak to another we have to recover a little bit of that or at least understand what it is that we've lost we have time for two more hi so if the inevitable blue wave that we always hear about comes in 2018 do you think President Trump will go there we'll end up going back to his democrat tendencies and govern from the left or you think the media and the left have pushed him too far well do you think that inevitable blue wave in 2018 is going to come after the inevitable victory of Hillary Clinton in 2016 you know that inevitable victory that a study from Princeton University said was going to happen with 99 percent certitude the week before the election and then no whoops it didn't and actually it was an electoral landslide for Donald Trump certainly history shows us that Democrats should retake the house if not all of Congress this cycle that's just sort of what happens and Donald Trump has a lot of forces against him he has more opposition than your average president so that should happen that said I'm not really convinced that it will or that it'll be some wave what they do on the left is they use the vehicles of the mainstream media that we can't get access to and they use a public opinion polls and they use commentary to shape public opinion they say it's inevitable it's inevitable Republicans don't even why would you even bother going out to vote don't even bother it's a waste of gas you know gas is expensive stay home that's fine then attorney then we win and we all go out and vote and then we win so I'm not I'm not convinced of that premise if if the Democrats retake the Congress or something and Donald Trump feels that he has to move more to the center to govern I suppose that would be possible but I don't give Democrats enough credit for that because that would be the smartest thing they could possibly do is to try to make a deal with Donald Trump and be nice to him and compromise and have an order the deal but they're just too thick for that they just won't do it they hate him in such a bizarre visceral irrational screaming no kind of way that I don't think they could bring themselves to do it and moreover I don't think there would allow them to do it they've ginned people up into hysteria for so long hysteria that proved completely pointless and untrue and unfounded and I don't think they're gonna be able to pull them back to any practical governing coalition skin recorders yeah you might not need a mic but I need you to have a mic so I was just a bit confused about the terminology that you were using earlier and I was you could clarify this for me so you talked about the left perverting culture right and I'm curious and then later on you use the term our culture so I'm curious what you mean by our culture is it the West is it your culture is it the left and the rights is it American I'm not sure we share a culture we share a culture and obviously some of us look if we're here at the University of Pennsylvania and people are wearing bowties and we're having nice polite conversation that is a different culture than might be happening in downtown Detroit on some awful block right now that's certainly true but there are different cultures there are local cultures and state and gets a little bigger and we have a Christian culture the Christendom or the Western culture certainly that's all true the important point here is that cult culture and cult derive from the same word they come from the same place and that's because what the culture worships will define it if a culture is worships money it will be more materialistic if a culture worship sex it will be a little more life sensuous and our culture does both of those and that's not bad all the time you know if it's a little bit moderation but it's it's clearly gone to excess that is that that's what I mean by our culture our national culture or whatever there are obvious layers here and what we have to do is decide what the culture is going to worship you know not to proselytize to you too much here at the end of this but it's a really important cultural and philosophical point which is that Moses asks God he says who will I tell them that you are and God says tell them I am that I am that God is the God is being you could there is you couldn't say it more simply than that and when a culture grounds itself in the I am Jesus says in the Gospels before Abraham was I am in the present am when the culture grounds itself in the I am it knows who it is and when the culture doesn't ground itself in the I am when it divorces itself from the I am and all of the blessings that this Christian civilization has given to us you are left only with the pathetic question Who am I and people try on various identities and they create different fads and fashions and ideologies and this week I'm a vegan and this week I'm a crossfitter and this week you know I'm gonna have this that or the other thing and all of those identities are unsatisfying because they're not essential they don't they're not from the I am and so my word of advice for the culture writ large my word of advice to the popular culture is high cut higher conservatives like me to be in the movies and to write the movies and my advice for the popular culture writ large is to look carefully at what it's worshiping and who it's worshipping that's the only way to get it on the right track and it's therefore the only way to get politics back on the right track are you thank you all so much mr. closeout tonight I want to thank everyone again for coming out what a fantastic conversation
