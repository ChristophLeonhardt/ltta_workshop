for cops in South Carolina were tragically shot although luckily they have not died as a result of the gunshot wounds they respond they were responding to a domestic violence call when the suspect later opened fire on them so let me give you the details on that it all began shortly after 10:00 p.m. after deputies responded to reports of a man assaulting a woman at a home outside of York South Carolina by the time the officers arrived to the scene the male suspect had already fled on foot at that point they sent out a k-9 unit to find him now a k-9 k-9 unit did manage to find the suspect and that was when the suspect opened fire on the first cop unfortunately he did get struck by bullets but he was immediately sent to the hospital and he is luckily still alive around 1:07 a.m. in an area near the home the suspect opened fire and struck an officer from the canine you at noon two hours later around 3:00 a.m. the suspect opened fire again and struck three more officers now the cops did shoot him he did not die from the gunshot wounds he is now in custody he was identified as 47 year old Christian Thomas McCall and he will be facing serious charges as a result but just to give you a little bit about McCall's past he had been charged with assaulting an officer resisting arrest and assault back in 1994 luckily no one has died from this story but what really stood out to me was the fact that it's very common for officers to be met with violence when they're responding specifically to domestic violence calls in fact let me give you some of the statistics on that the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund released a report in 2016 which chronicled all law enforcement deaths in the line of duty between 2010 and 2014 and it showed that domestic dispute was the initial 9-1-1 call in 22 percent of cases more than any other type of call yeah so let's talk about a couple of different angles to this story one is that when there's a political shooting and in this case to the best of our knowledge that has nothing new with any kind of politics so whether it's a political shooting that is tied to Islamic extremism or right-wing extremism it gets a lot of coverage the Islamic extremism of course he has far more coverage but we took make a big deal out of it but as usual the media focused on the wrong things I get it as sensational and it scares us and makes us want to watch TV but if in reality cops get hurt the most in domestic violence cause there's nothing political there's nothing to politicize right so Cable News isn't talking about it 24/7 but in reality that is when they are in most danger so we should be cognizant of that I hold the police departments around the country are cognizant of that secondarily a lot of the mass shooters have had a history of domestic violence Sutherland Springs Texas the guy who shot all those folks in in a church in Texas the Las Vegas shooter would try not to give the names after the first time we do this story because we don't want to glorify these shooters but the Vega Vegas Massacre that was a guy who committed domestic violence before the neo-nazi in Charlottesville who ran people over domestic violence again you could say those are anecdotal but you just saw the numbers that Ana gave it is the number one most likely time that an officer is going to be killed is responding domestic violence so I agree with you that this particular story is not political in nature but there is there is a political point that I want to make and it's something that I think a lot of people get uncomfortable with but it's just the fact of the matter and something that should be considered so there are organizations like the NRA and some on the right although not all who believe that if an individual has a past of domestic violence that person should still have his or her constitutional rights intact meaning that they should still have their second Amendment rights intact and they should be able to go purchase a weapon if they wish to do so and I think that that's something that we should really rethink especially given the threat that these individuals have posed to law enforcement and to the general public I mean we really need to start thinking about what standards if any we're ever gonna have in regard to who can purchase a gun so they say no that's a civil rights issue I have my rights to a gun even if I've beaten people in the past in a domestic violence situation but wait a minute we give away our civil rights all the time so we all take off our shoes at an airport that has inconvenienced hundreds of millions be a fact probably in mass billions of people I want argue that a TSA agent putting her hands down my pants and in my underwear you know during a checkpoint or whatever is an unreasonable search and seizure I don't know yeah and look I've gotten the pat-down where they you know had to go around my genitals as well so I mean it's not you might say they take it off your shoes a small thing that guy was a unsuccessful shoe bomber never killed anyway well these these are cops being killed hundreds of cops have been killed because we didn't take away guns from people who had committed crimes that we know are the most likely to get cops shot right so so and then on the on the rights at the airports I mean yes it gets way worse they the pat-downs etc because of why the underwear bomber again no one died and I want me but I want to be safe on a plane I think planes all the time but we all give away these massive rights but when it comes to people who have committed domestic abuse their rights are we can't touch even though that actually leads to tremendous violence not only guess the women men who are abused but then the cops who respond right and just think about that for a second a person who has been you know hurting whoever's living with them has been guilty of domestic violence owning a gun inside the home around the individuals that he has he or she has done domestic abuse to it it just sounds like a really bad idea and it's something that we should really start to reconsider I don't know if that'll ever happen but it's scary to think that we continuously protect these people and if you think blue lives matter you should care about this and one last thing about that this is part of the reason why cops are so jittery and why do they shoot so quickly another cycle of vicious cycle of violence that is created because when they go to people's houses even if they committed crimes in the past even if they were violent crimes a lot of times they still get to own a gun so they're worried hey if I go to somebody's house they're gonna shoot me too sometimes they wind up shooting for cops so we have got to do just at least a little bit of regulation to get guns out of the hands of people in war who we already know are dangerous what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do
