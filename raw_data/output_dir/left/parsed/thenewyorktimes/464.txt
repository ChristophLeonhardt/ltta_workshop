We're giving you know the
community an opportunity to
know that they can relax,
knowing that their children are
here and are here safely.
They're getting their homework
done.
They're being fed
enrichment programs.
They're being fed
STEM programs.
They are writing. 
They're reading.
I mean we're trying, We
try to do everything that
we can think of to help
them become well-rounded.
Our funding comes completely
from 21st Century.
We are a federally funded
program.
And if they did not
provide the funding, you know,
for our afterschool program, we
wouldn't have a program.
They're hardworking students.
And the program 
allows them an opportunity
to be enriched with
other activities.
But they're not paying for it
because
their parents can't afford to
pay for it.
And that's the glory of the
program.
