00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,589
everyone welcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> to post lunch my name</font>

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,440
is Ted I am also interestingly enough a

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,630
futurist at a movie studio at a big

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,090
movie studio 20th Century Fox and I was

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,530
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> before when shuttle is up there</font>

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,599
talking that I've never been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,850
comment with two futures at the same

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,320
time and I was wondering if we cancel

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,090
each other out and then there's no

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,710
future for any of us this is what I was

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,619
thinking but let's hopefully not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:26,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you about some</font>

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,019
interesting things first I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font>

14
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,050
this up both you would hear me and you'd

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,510
also hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from Ford say that we are</font>

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,640
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really real futurists were</font>

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,290
more like futurists in training hi

18
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,050
everybody he's a real futurist if you

19
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,340
want to do a little research on him and

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,899
see what he's up to he's an interesting

21
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,850
guy they're fully get started with<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,110
little talk we're gonna try a little

23
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,510
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of futuristic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spare iment so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

24
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,270
going to make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> prediction that every</font>

25
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,350
one of you here<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,129
your pocket or on your person you often

29
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,539
call it a smartphone do you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

30
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,790
those with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you do take it out</font>

31
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,100
hold it up i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try a very quick</font>

32
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,530
little experiment here we had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font>

33
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,070
percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay keep them hold them up high</font>

34
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,200
swap them with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your neighbor i'm gonna</font>

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,990
give you mine you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yours people</font>

36
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,820
who ever got<font color="#CCCCCC"> one up here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> swap but nobody</font>

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,640
brought theirs with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so now you</font>

38
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,220
swap with your neighbor put that new

39
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,350
phone in your pocket of your purse just

40
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,020
try it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a second</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

41
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,360
mine over here I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with</font>

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,340
audiences of thousands of people and

43
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,720
small audiences the reaction is always

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,460
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same there's a chuckle and</font>

45
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,570
then there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of an</font>

46
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,720
uncomfortable sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of moment now things</font>

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,430
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself what's going on in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

brain in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind right now I haven't</font>

49
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,990

50
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,880
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more important than that away</font>

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,549
from you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

52
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:56,189
everybody feels a little odd yes see how

53
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,390
long you can hold out this is your

54
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,979
challenge just remember to give them

55
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,360
back or they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a crisis at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

56
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,530
of the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay just see how long you</font>

57
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,290
can hold out so here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font>

58
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,340
to talk about we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a</font>

59
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">little about human nature and what I</font>

60
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about all day long</font>

61
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,310
you're already traded you guys can't

62
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,900
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle it for five seconds right</font>

63
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">now that's an interesting comment on</font>

64
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,380
society what we're going to talk about

65
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">here so let's imagine that one of us are</font>

66
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,040
some of us went to jail tonight<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some</font>

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,100
strange reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay imagine that if you</font>

68
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,630
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your phone with you they</font>

69
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,370
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> it away when they incarcerated you</font>

70
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,500
who would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you be able to actually call</font>

71
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,510
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> your little robotic friend maybe</font>

72
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,890
you could call your<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents phone from</font>

73
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,720
when you grew up maybe you know one

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,239
other phone number but beyond that your

75
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,890
robot has taken over right you have

76
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,890
given<font color="#E5E5E5"> up control when was the last time</font>

77
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,420
you drove anywhere without using

78
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,610
navigation including places you know

79
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,620
damn well how to get to but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font>

80
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to check your waves your google maps to</font>

81
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,470
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the best route is what the most</font>

82
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,600
direct route is right these are things

83
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,790
that actually set the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage for what I</font>

84
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about as a futurist it's less</font>

85
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,690
about technology and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

86
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,630
connected to wit we are as humans and

87
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,340
how essentially we have given<font color="#CCCCCC"> up control</font>

88
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,390
which leads me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this quote which i</font>

89
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,540
think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font>

90
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,190
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was olds me he's a famous</font>

91
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,410
movie cowboy and it was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> very famous</font>

92
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,730
innovator if you're curious about Will

93
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,380
Rogers do a little research on Will

94
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,640
Rogers and see what he thought up this

95
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,500
is one of his quotes even if you're on

96
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right track you will get run over if</font>

97
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,970
you just sit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if you think of</font>

98
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,170
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> innovative most</font>

99
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,430
forward-thinking companies on what they

100
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,200
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and why they're constantly</font>

101
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,060
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reinvent themselves they're</font>

102
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,920
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time if</font>

103
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,900
they're at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top of their game things</font>

104
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,549
can change very quickly if they don't

105
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,440
keep altering and reworking and

106
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,010
rejiggering their<font color="#CCCCCC"> game so here's the</font>

107
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,090
only thing you have to read about my

108
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,590
presentation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is interesting</font>

109
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,180
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we talk about our little</font>

110
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,930
devices 4 out of 5 smartphone users

111
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,890
check their phones in the first 15

112
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,480
minutes of waking up this is all from

113
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,420
research back in 2013 I would say now in

114
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,150
2016 going into 2017 it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably like</font>

115
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,390
the first two minutes of waking up so

116
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,549
there she is you know they're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

117
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,109
little less happy and clearly unhappy

118
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,170
about that right eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent back in</font>

119
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,090
2013 say it's the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do in</font>

120
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,980
the morning I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> postulate by 2016</font>

121
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,200
it's close to a hundred percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

122
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,289
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do it right eighty</font>

123
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:21,450
percent three years ago said they have

124
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,290
their smartphone

125
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,510
with them are on them all but two hours

126
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">of their waking day I would postulate</font>

127
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,800
now that if we redid this study it would

128
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,170
be all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of about eight minutes every day</font>

129
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,960
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking a shower that's it</font>

130
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,490
and when you listen to Arianna

131
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,200
Huffington talk about the back of<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's</font>

132
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,520
selling and marketing a little

133
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,620
smartphone bed now for those either were

134
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,930
here a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> days ago this is a real</font>

135
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,570
thing right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are connected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to these</font>

136
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,640
devices in a very very intimate way

137
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,560
which leads me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this picture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

138
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,270
taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple weeks ago that's a</font>

139
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,120
starbucks now look at how people are

140
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,550
interacting and reactive they're leaning

141
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,530
into these devices and they have

142
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,420
incorporated them into their daily

143
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,570
existence in a very robust way so here's

144
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,980
the question that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about at</font>

145
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,430
a movie studio is do we go here next are

146
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,460
we ready because of that experiment we

147
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,780
just didn't help connected you are to

148
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,080
these devices to move to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next step</font>

149
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">in how we visualize things all of these</font>

150
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices this screen here these screens</font>

151
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,660
here that I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your little</font>

152
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,270
tiny and moderately sized screens or all

153
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,070
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> call restricted space they all</font>

154
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,530
have some sort of border on them if I

155
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">can take that border away and give you</font>

156
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,710
an effectively infinite amount of space

157
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,910
to do your productivity to do your

158
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,380
entertainment to do your socialization

159
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,310
is that something you're interested in

160
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,530
is that something you're curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

161
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,600
and how curious have you become because

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> living on a screen from the point</font>

163
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,440
you wake up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning so typically</font>

164
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,610
the point you go to bed<font color="#E5E5E5"> at night and</font>

165
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,950
almost everybody is so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

166
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,870
most popular tethered solutions now on

167
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,790
the market is this step one in the

168
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">equation they're all connected to</font>

169
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,840
computers or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Playstation which is</font>

170
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,480
essentially a less powerful computer

171
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,580
that's graphics incentives they're

172
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,380
essentially gaming and gaming style

173
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,790
devices that have some other

174
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,400
capabilities and then there's mobile

175
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,380
these are the two most popular sort of

176
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,270
well marketed and well exposed as a

177
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,470
whole bunch of other ones out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

178
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,290
market these are essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phone</font>

179
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">smartphone accessories that allow that</font>

180
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,630
restricted space to become unrestricted

181
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,360
space and start to track with you so I

182
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,920
start to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all these things</font>

183
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,860
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> day long as we live</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the future</font>

184
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what we think about from a future</font>

185
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,580
standpoint

186
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,620
so now you're asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay really so</font>

187
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,270
you saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> the woman from Ford and now you</font>

188
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,400
got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a movie studio who claims</font>

189
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,039
to be a futurist<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight and some of</font>

190
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,599
the background<font color="#CCCCCC"> as to why I do this and</font>

191
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,219
how come I do this now comes some

192
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:48,360
comfortable sort of with all this

193
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,430
nonsense and what you know what gives me

194
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right to do this nonsense right well</font>

195
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,990
I grew<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here more specifically here in</font>

196
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,340
Central Florida which I often refer to

197
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,400
as the funnel of crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so all the</font>

198
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,139
crazy that happens in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US all sort of</font>

199
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,849
funnels down to this little funnel down

200
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:07,940
at the bottom and that's where I grew up

201
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,889
when I moved there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a little kid six</font>

202
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">years old this was the Florida the pre</font>

203
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,599
backwoods of pre racist<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was actually</font>

204
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,000
kind of a scary place the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next year when</font>

205
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,909
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven my world completely changed</font>

206
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:24,000
and I literally grew up in the world of

207
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,300
the future this was my reality and I

208
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,310
understood something about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

209
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,719
very early age that i still<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring with</font>

210
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:32,729
me today every day to work and every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

211
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:33,930
as I travel around the world giving

212
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,639
talks and explaining this stuff to

213
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,830
people is the concept of all I call

214
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,349
spatial entertainment there's often a

215
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:41,370
reference point about people talking

216
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,400
about there is a correlation to 3d and

217
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,340
VR there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a very minor correlation</font>

218
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,259
in my opinion because when you

219
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,150
understand theme park entertainment you

220
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,039
understand spatial entertainment where

221
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,750
you're actually moving around through

222
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,940
things and entertainment takes on a

223
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,270
ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take you places and bring you</font>

224
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,650
to things and allow you to interact and

225
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,509
immerse yourself a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> way then</font>

226
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:05,400
restricted displays flat space stuff

227
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,770
even with a 3d layer on it this is much

228
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,210
more robust<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and if you've</font>

229
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,560
grown<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in a theme park like me you</font>

230
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,900
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very innate understanding of what</font>

231
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that how that's powerful so</font>

232
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,110
very often when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give these toxins we</font>

233
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,080
do Q&A people ask me things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I say if</font>

234
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">you think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what VR and ultimately</font>

235
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,949
AR will be the best even though it's a

236
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">little funny to say it is imagine a day</font>

237
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,789
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to strap a theme park on</font>

238
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,009
to your face and you'll be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

239
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,289
theme park level experiences with that

240
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:33,630
level of intensity and that level of

241
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,458
connectivity and that level of immersion

242
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,890
but you could take it anywhere so that's

243
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,019
what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all day long this is</font>

244
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">something I put together for this</font>

245
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,360
presentation because I was also thinking

246
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,339
about form factor and I was thinking

247
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how form factor is a continual</font>

248
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,360
state of change and we've actually been

249
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,850
kind

250
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,800
load into a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of a stopping</font>

251
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,569
point with form factor as I look around

252
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:54,220
this room we're all looking at shards of

253
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,709
glass summer between this size and this

254
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,600
size and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind of where we sat for</font>

255
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,870
probably seven ish years ago from when

256
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stephen should ask the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone</font>

257
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">right but you can see the form factor</font>

258
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,420
and what changes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we're changing</font>

259
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,490
is another example of how the form

260
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,980
factor changes I often give the

261
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,660
reference the representation although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

262
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,069
got in trouble for it once<font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

263
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,060
friends at Samsung because I'm

264
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,860
completely complimentary of all this VRA

265
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,240
our stuff but i also have a

266
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,339
recognization of where we are in the

267
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,380
industry and where we sit now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say</font>

268
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we are in the brick cell phone days</font>

269
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:28,240
of virtual reality because we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

270
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,880
pathway where were actually believe it

271
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,560
or not there's more wrong with what

272
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,610
we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> when it comes to the</font>

273
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,990
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and evolution of it then</font>

274
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,329
right we're on a pathway to<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and</font>

275
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:38,709
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the only one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that says that all</font>

276
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:39,819
the big companies that are doing this

277
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:41,290
have an awareness that we're on a

278
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">stepping stone journey just like this</font>

279
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,250
stepping stone journey to where we are

280
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,240
today with the devices we use now so as

281
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,709
I wrap up this very short little

282
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,139
truncated talk the question is are we

283
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:56,079
going to go here next my theory is that

284
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:58,689
the box on face stuff that we're doing

285
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:00,160
now and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go see one out there</font>

286
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,110
there's a vide outside amazingly

287
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,720
powerful amazingly interesting but they

288
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,509
are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future the box on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the face</font>

289
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,509
will only take us so far we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

290
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,000
keep evolving this and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do our jobs</font>

291
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,279
right and we as an audience and a group

292
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,839
of collective people trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

293
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,790
ball<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward keep saying not good enough</font>

294
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,620
not good enough keep trying harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

295
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually get to some sort of eyewear</font>

296
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,550
and we at Fox are working on very

297
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,110
closely with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> company odg you've</font>

298
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,430
probably heard about magic leap so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

299
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,470
spent a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of time down there that's</font>

300
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,180
more of the evolution of where things

301
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,889
are headed and even none of that is good

302
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,019
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet but we're heading toward</font>

303
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,870
something that will start to look like

304
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,699
our glasses like our spectacles and

305
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:42,399
eventually I can't predict exactly the

306
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,470
time but it's let's give ourselves a

307
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,269
five to seven-year runway eventually you

308
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:48,610
won't need any of the physical I we're

309
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,680
at all and I can spend some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

310
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,759
