Justice Anthony Kennedy
announced his retirement,
effective July 31.
Justice Kennedy’s
greatest judicial legacy
was his
championship of gay rights.
He wrote every major gay
rights decision,
including one called Obergefell,
which established
a constitutional right
to same-sex marriage,
and it will be what he is most
remembered for.
Justice Kennedy was a moderate
conservative; voted more often
with the court’s
conservative wing;
was the author of Citizens
United, which amplified
the role of money in politics;
cast a vote with the
five-justice majority
in Bush v. Gore
in 2000,
which handed the presidency
to President George W. Bush —
“I George Walker Bush,
do solemnly swear."
— joined the five-justice
majority
in District of Columbia
against Heller,
which revolutionized
Second Amendment law
and established a personal
right to keep and bear arms.
He was often prepared to cut
back on the death penalty,
whether it involved
people
with intellectual disabilities,
people who committed crimes
when they were younger
than 18
or people who committed
crimes other than murder.
He joined the controlling
opinion and in a 1992 decision,
Planned Parenthood against
Casey, which re-established
and saved Roe v. Wade,
the decision that
guarantees a constitutional
right to abortion.
And in recent years,
he has joined the
court’s liberals
in cases on affirmative
action and abortion.
And those cases in which
Justice Kennedy joined
the court's four more
liberal members are almost
certainly at risk if
President Trump appoints
a conservative to the court.
