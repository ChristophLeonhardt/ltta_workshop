Justice Kennedy's retirement makes the issue of Senate control one of the vital issues of our time well you can say that again Republicans in the Senate are moving to carry out a swift confirmation of whomever the president puts up to replace Anthony Kennedy despite their very slim majority I think that we got plenty of precedent when to have appointments as very important when not do at this particular time it's it's the Senate's obligation to move ahead and do what they should do in these matters now Democrats say that any vote should take place after the midterm elections especially given that McConnell said they couldn't possibly consider a new Supreme Court justice in the run-up to the last election our Republican colleagues in the Senate should follow the rule they set in 2016 not to consider a Supreme Court justice in an election year for four months away from an election we 1/3 of the United States Senate practically is up for election the decision that we make is going to have generational impact and the American people should be able to weigh in as for what is at stake for the Democratic Party here's some of what we heard earlier on this network it's not acceptable to accept this as a fait accompli in other words for the next three decades or more we're gonna be run by a five-to-four right-wing court and just accept that if you lay down like the experts to say and lay down and accept this as as history that can't be stopped you're gonna see a political party in serious implosion you watch with us for more tonight Jeremy Peters political reporter for The New York Times and sungmin Kim White House reporter for The Washington Post welcome to you both Jeremy it in talking about this before the broadcast court pics are a safe haven where Republicans and Donald Trump come together and Republicans even some never Trump errs voted for Trump because of the court and so this is an area where it seems to me it's going to be hard to peel off publicans if you go with Chris Matthews argument oh that's exactly right and everybody says every time there's a 50/50 split issue in the Senate maybe you can peel away Lisa Murkowski or Susan Collins it's going to be extraordinarily difficult you know what else is going to be extraordinarily difficult is the Democrats in red states who are going to be under pressure to support the president's nominee could you imagine somebody like the Heidi Heitkamp or a Joe Manchin who is waffling Trump will land his plane in West Virginia in North Dakota and harassed them saying they are blocking my nominee they are are they are nullifying your vote this is what you voted for and a lot of them realize this is exactly what they voted for you're right president Trump took the unprecedented step of giving them a list of names people he would appoint to the court so they knew they could trust him this is a solemn pledge between him and his base and he will not break it some men I know you're not the parliamentarian of the Senate but you and Jeremy are really smart so you get this question and that is when the Democrats talk about blocking tactics when people like Chris on the air earlier today talked about parliamentary tactics what can the minority party do Minority not by much what can the minority party do in the person of Chuck Schumer to slow this down to throw something in the spokes well frankly there's not a lot that Democrats can do at this point you're right that in the Senate Democrats in the or the minority in this case Democrats do have some rights but in the case of judicial nominations they don't have much recourse at this point remember we've seen the filibuster for nominations erode bit by bit over the last several years they began in 2013 with Senate Democrats going nuclear on most nominations and Senate Republicans last year finishing the job by getting rid of that filibuster for Supreme Court nominations so that is why Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans can easily pass whomever they want whomever Trump picks as long as their ranks stick together so in terms of strategy there's not a lot for a Chuck Schumer and his ranks to do here I mean with anything in the Senate you can slow down the process by some days but at the end of the day it's inevitable as long as all Republicans say together that whomever Trump nominates in the coming weeks will get confirmed hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
