it's Friday Hollywood actress and model Emily Ratajkowski is flaunting something no it is not her naked backside believe it or not her abundant wealth just in time for holiday shopping I will tell you all about that coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel celebrity hypocrisy is literally one of the least surprising things you ever hear about all the time we hear about celebrities complaining that CEOs of corporations are getting richer while the rest of America is getting poor nevermind the fact that most of these celebrities and politicians pontificating on such matters are worth tens and sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars they love to criticize Americans who support this president they support anti-fascist movements and yet they don't seem to see the irony in the fact that this is one of the most Pro capitalism Pro broad wealth presidents of our time and in fact the policies that they are pushing for are actually fashion fascist or socialist at best because of this president and his economic policies more Americans are back to work more companies are thriving and as a result they are hiring more people and I have something that I call the labor day state doctrine now after Labor Day in September Bloomberg published a report showing that more Americans are buying stakes so for their Labor Day barbecue instead of buying cheaper meats like hotdogs and ground chuck they are splurging on t-bones now why does this matter because it is a very bold marketplace indicator that consumer confidence is so high that not only are Americans more easily paying their bills these days but they are now more comfortable splurging on the finer things in life now that's not to say that many Americans are not still struggling last year a survey performed by Bank Rate found that for 57% of Americans an unexpected expense of $500 would put them in debt so side note here make sure you save money even just a little bit every month helps anyway as we know celebrities are very far out of touch with the everyday realities of most Americans case in point Emily Ratajkowski and her $200,000 holiday shopping list Emily Ratajkowski who in a vogue you a few years ago said that if she ran for president her platform would be redistributing wealth yep that same idiot is talking about her holiday shopping list that tops out at an amount more than what most people make working a full-time job over a four-year span so what is on her list well let's start out with the cheapest thing literally the least expensive item on her list is still $200 and it is a velvet drawstring bag that looks like some cosmetic pouch that you would get free with the purchase of a fragrance set at Macy's but hey when you have money to burn you can spend money on a moldy green velvet looking purse also on her list is an $11,000 Rolex a $35,000 Rolex and a $4,000 saline purse a sequined bag by Paco Rabanne because yes it's 1998 again apparently and to top it all off because every American totally needs this a $145,000 Hermes bag that's literally a house a nice house in some parts of this country that's a house that's three cars two and a half years of income but yes to Emily Ratajkowski one hundred and forty five thousand dollars for a purse is right up her alley you know what maybe I'm being too harsh on her maybe I'm being too cynical maybe what she means by her holiday shopping list is that she is going to buy these things and redistribute them to other less fortunate Americans because that's what she talked about a few years ago she wants to redistribute wealth so anyway celebrities are out of touch that's nothing new hope you all have a fantastic weekend I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at www.osr.wa.gov.au/payrollenquiry you
