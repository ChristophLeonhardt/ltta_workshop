There's a lot going wrong in the world
"yeah I'm not a good guy"
"and when you're a start they let you do it."
"rained down bullets"
"brutal civil war"
Trump: "North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States."
But when you zoom out in a lot of big ways
the world is getting better.
People living longer than ever. Global poverty
is plummeting.
So many fewer people are going hungry.
And deaths from the scourge of malaria
are dropping.
Children are doing better
too – child mortality is dropping around
the world.
And so is child labor.
Deaths from war are over all headed downward
and recent decades have been
historically less violent.
And though humanity faces a crisis with climate
change –
there is some good news.
More and more countries are signing on to global
agreements to fight climate change and
coal production peaked in 2013 – it's now
falling.
So today let's hope the world
keeps getting better and be grateful
that it has been.
Couple more things to give thanks for –  my parents, to our world
and data where so much of this data
comes from and to all of you for
watching. Thank you.
