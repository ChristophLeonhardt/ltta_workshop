most people watch sports to get away from politics of course but in the NFL ratings are dropping sponsors are pulling ads and season ticket holders are canceling subscriptions so the Commissioner met with team owners and players regarding the anthem controversy and he accomplished absolutely nothing but Goodell says he understands how the fans feel I understand where our fans feel about this issue and we feel the same way about the importance of our flag about the importance of patriotism and I believe our players feel that way even so the players basically said no dice to stopping their protests and the anthem farce continues now two dozen players protested the anthems in some way on last Sunday the protests ranged from taking a knee sitting on the bench staying in the tunnel or raising a fist yet how odd the NFL can't whip these sluggos into shape after all the no-fun league has a very defined code when it comes to what players can and cannot do on the field for example if you put a personal message on your uniform that's a six thousand and seventy six dollar first offense a figure that doubles the second time you do it as for the anthem protests being about free speech where did this argument go when Goodell denied Dallas Cowboy players requests to wear a deckle honoring the Dallas police officers shot and killed in August 2016 why did the Commish threatened fines when Tennessee Titans linebacker Avery Williamson wanted to wear special cleats commemorating the 15th anniversary of 9/11 reportedly no fines were levied but the threats of a fine were enough for Williamson to auction off the shoes for charity rather than wear them but when it comes to making a mockery of the national anthem well boys will be boys that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on youtube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always too into you today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
