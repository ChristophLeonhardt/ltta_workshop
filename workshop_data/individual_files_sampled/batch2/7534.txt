IN AN EFFORT TO FURTHER DELEGITIMIZE SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION INTO POSSIBLE RUSSIAN COLLUSION, HOUSE CONSERVATIVES ARE NOW DEMANDING A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A SECOND SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FBI. THIS IS THEIR RESPONSE TO A NEW YORK TIMES REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED LAST WEEK INDICATING THAT DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THE FBI HAD A SECRET INFORMANT INFILTRATE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THERE WAS EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WORKING FOR THE CAMPAIGN HAD SOME CONNECTION TO RUSSIANS. SO THAT REPORT, WHICH I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS ON IN JUST A MINUTE HAS BEEN MISCONSTRUED AND TWISTED IN A WAY TO MAKE IT SEEM AS THOUGH IT WAS A POLITICAL EFFORT I THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO GO AFTER TRUMP, BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS HAPPENED DURING THE ELECTION. WE DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT UNTIL NOW. THE FBI WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO CONCEAL IT WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY VERY PUBLICLY INVESTIGATING HILLARY CLINTON NOT ONCE BUT TWICE, AND SO THIS WAS NOT A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ISSUE. WHAT WAS REALLY AN ISSUE HERE WAS PEOPLE LIKE PAPADOPOULOS OPENLY TALKING ABOUT THEIR TIES TO RUSSIANS AND HOW THE RUSSIANS HAD OFFERED DIRT ON HILLARY CLINTON AND THAT BASICALLY SPURRED THIS INFORMANT IN THIS INVESTIGATION. REPRESENTATIVE LEE ZELDIN, WHO IS A REPUBLICAN, HELD THIS PRESS CONFERENCE WITH OTHER REPUBLICANS WITH HIM AND HE IS SAYING LOOK, WE NEED THIS SECOND SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE THE FBI AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. A COUPLE OF IRONIC NOTES HERE. FIRST OF ALL, ALL DEPARTMENTS TO INVESTIGATE THEMSELVES. THAT IS WHERE THEY HAVE INSPECTOR GENERALS, AND THE PEOPLE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT FEAR THE INSPECTOR GENERAL BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ATTACHED TO ANYONE ELSE. THEY ARE ON A PURPOSE REMOVED FROM THE REST OF THE STAFF BECAUSE IT IS THEIR JOB TO INVESTIGATE THEM. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS USED THEIR INSPECTOR GENERAL A TON OF TIMES, COUNTLESS TIMES AND ROSENSTEIN HERE SAYING OH, YOU WANT TO LOOK INTO WHETHER IT WAS A LEGITIMATE WARRANT OR IF IT WAS A POLITICAL THING? OKAY. I THINK THAT IS FAIR. IN FACT, I SAID THAT ON THE SHOW YESTERDAY WHEN THE NEWS CAME OUT. I WAS LIKE YOU WANT TO USE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THAT IS WHAT HE IS FOR. THE IDEA THAT THE DEPARTMENT CANNOT INVESTIGATE ITSELF IS NOT TRUE. WHETHER YOU TRUST THAT INVESTIGATION IS A GOOD QUESTION AND IT DEPENDS ON THE DEPARTMENT AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS. IF YOU SAID DO YOU TRUST THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE ITSELF DURING THE J EDGAR HOOVER HERE I WOULD SAY NO, I DO NOT. IF YOU SAID DO YOU TRUST THE CIA TO INVESTIGATE ITSELF TODAY? I WOULD SAY NO, AND BY THE WAY, SO WITH THESE REPUBLICANS. THEY SAID WHEN GINA HASKEL TORTURED PEOPLE AND DESTROYED THE EVIDENCE IT WAS OKAY BECAUSE THE CIA LOOKED INTO IT AND SAID IT WAS FINE. INTERESTING, YOU SEEM TO HAVE A DIFFERENT STANDARD. THAT KIND OF INTERNAL INVESTIGATION IS TOTALLY FINE WITH THEM. THE CIA, THAT WE CAN TRUST. ALTHOUGH NOW, SOME OF THE OTHER CONSERVATIVES ARE LUMPING THE CIA WITH OTHER PEOPLE PLOTTING A COUP AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. I CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THEIR CONSPIRACY THEORIES. IN REALITY, THIS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS INVESTIGATED DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, HILLARY CLINTON EXHAUSTIVELY AND IT IS A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT APPOINTED BY DONALD TRUMP AND ALL FILLED WITH REPUBLICANS. I BELIEVE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL CAN HANDLE IT AND IF I THOUGHT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WAS GOING TO BE A PERSON THAT THEY APPOINTED WHO WAS FAIR AND NONPARTISAN, I DON'T THINK IT IS WARRANTED IN THIS CASE BUT IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT QUESTION. YOU THINK THEY ARE GOING TO APPOINT A FAIR AND HONEST SPECIAL COUNSEL? NO, THEY ARE GOING TO BRING JUDGE NAPOLITANO BACK, THEY ARE GOING TO GET THE HACK OF ALL HACKS AND SAY, YEAH, LOOK AT ALL THIS EVIDENCE WE FOUND ON THIS INVESTIGATION, SO HELL NO. IN THIS CASE I TRUST THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AT TIMES MORE THAN I TRUST HER SO-CALLED SPECIAL COUNSEL. LET'S ALSO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT INFORMANT BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANTED THE IDENTITY OF THAT INFORMANT AND THE NEW YORK TIMES AND WASHINGTON POST REFUSED TO RELEASE THE INDIVIDUAL'S NAME TO PROTECT HIS IDENTITY, TO PROTECT HIS SAFETY BUT THEY ALSO GAVE VERY SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT THE MEETINGS HE HAD WITH PAPADOPOULOS FOR INSTANCE, SO IT WAS INCREDIBLY EASY TO CONNECT. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE DAILY CALLER DID. THEY WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE INFORMANT WAS A MAN BY THE NAME OF STEFAN HELPER. HE IS ACTUALLY A LONGTIME REPUBLICAN. HE WORKED IN THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION. HE WORKED FOR CARTER AND ALSO THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION SO THIS IS NOT SOME BERNIE SANDERS PROGRESSIVE THAT'S TRYING TO INFILTRATE TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN AND DESTROY HIM. AGAIN, WE DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THIS UNTIL NOW. WE ARE IN 2018, THIS INVESTIGATION HAPPENED IN 2016 DURING THE ELECTION, BEFORE TRUMP WAS EVEN ELECTED. AND AS WE HAVE EXPLAINED NOW, THE FBI DID TRUMP A GIGANTIC FAVOR BY NOT REVEALING THE INVESTIGATION DURING THE ELECTION WHEN ON TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS THEY DID TALK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S INVESTIGATION. THEY WERE DOING BOTH INVESTIGATIONS OF BOTH CANDIDATES. THEY TALKED ABOUT ONE BUT NOT THE OTHER AND THAT AFFECTED THE ELECTION TO DONALD TRUMP'S SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE. AND REMEMBER, PAPADOPOULOS IS THE ONE WHO WAS IN AUSTRALIA BRAGGING ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION HE HAD WITH THE RUSSIANS, SO I DO NOT KNOW WHAT EXACTLY EVIDENCE THEY USED TO OBTAIN THE WARRANTS INTO THIS INVESTIGATION, BUT YOU SHOULD BE PISSED AT PAPADOPOULOS WHO WAS RUNNING HIS MOUTH ABOUT HIS TIES TO RUSSIANS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANTED THE FBI TO DO IN THAT CASE AND PAPADOPOULOS HAPPENED TO BE IN LONDON ACTUALLY AND HE WAS TALKING TO THE AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR IN LONDON AND HE SAYS BY THE WAY, WE ARE WORKING WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AND TRIED TO GET INFORMATION ON OUR OPPONENT. LET'S SAY PAPADOPOULOS WAS WORKING WITH HILLARY CLINTON. DO YOU THINK THE FBI, ONCE THEY FOUND OUT FROM THE AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR WOULD BE LIKE OH, HILLARY CLINTON IS WORKING WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO GET THERE ON DONALD TRUMP THAT IS ILLEGAL. LET'S JUST DROP IT. NO, THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE ABOUT IT. THEY WOULD HAVE, BUT YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE? IF THEY KNEW AND THEY GOT INFORMATION SAYING HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN IS WORKING WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT ONE THAT IS HOSTILE TO US TO RIG THE ELECTION, DO YOU THINK THE FBI SHOULD HAVE JUST DROPPED IT, NOT EVEN INVESTIGATED IT? OF COURSE NOT. HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF PRINCIPLE. I KNOW THAT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR FROM MAGA GUYS. ONE PART OF THE STORY IS VERY IMPORTANT. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN PRESSURING MUELLER TO GIVE UP, NOT GIVE UP BUT REVEAL SOME OF THE EVIDENCE THAT HE IS WORKING WITH, WHICH IS A RIDICULOUS REQUEST. NOW THEY ARE USING THIS INFORMATION ABOUT THE INFILTRATOR, THE FBI INFORMANTS TO REALLY PUSH TO SEE SOME OF THE EVIDENCE. AS FAR AS I KNOW, THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHAT THEY HAVE ASKED FOR, HOWEVER, ROD ROSENSTEIN HAS AGREED TO LOOK INTO THE FBI'S ACTIONS WITH THIS INFORMANT. AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHO IS HATCHING THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES, I KNOW AND EXPLAINED IT BUT I WANT TO REMIND YOU IT IS NOT SOME RANDOM GUY ON TWITTER OR GUY WRITING FOR BREITBART. THESE ARE UNITED STATES CONGRESSMAN WHO JUST DID A PRESS CONFERENCE SAYING YEAH, WE THINK THAT PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE BASICALLY DOING A POLITICAL COUP AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND HAD ALWAYS PLANNED TO DO SO. WHY? BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT FOR SURE DONALD TRUMP WOULD WIN AND HANDS THEY PLANNED THAT AHEAD OF TIME AND ARE DOING THIS. THESE ARE LUNATICS, THIS IS NOT THE FREEDOM CAUCUS, THIS IS MAYBE FREEDOM FROM THEIR OWN MINDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST IT. IT IS THE BROWN SHIRT CONFERENCE. MARK MEADOWS, MATT GATES, CLAUDIA TENDING, JODI HEISE AND OF COURSE IS HELD IN. THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO ARE GOING TO BE FIRST UP THAT IF THERE IS AN IMPEACHMENT EFFORT, IF TRUMP DID THE CRIMES AND THEY DEFEAT THAT EFFORTS AND TRUMP IS STILL IN CHARGE, THESE GUYS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO GO ROUND PEOPLE UP.
