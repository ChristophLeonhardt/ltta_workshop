1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,220
 

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,520
I feel there's something changing

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,180
In realtime

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,160
It's a transformation that I

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,420
Can't hide no

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,220
You light me up like it's nothin'

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,940
You making' me into something

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,220
With a fire inside

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,720
Yeah

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,860
When I'm fallin' apart

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,400
Yeah you're always my safety net

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,260
Take a jump

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,060
Off the edge

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,740
And I know

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,000
That you'll never

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,680
Let me fall

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,020
It's a rush to the senses

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,860
Such a sweet luminescence

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,560
That I can't quite describe

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,760
Oh I'm seeing sound in colour

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,300
Every time that I get around ya

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,420
Oh Oh Oh

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,280
No I'll never

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,060
Let you go

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,760
You got me headed straight

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,560
For the skyline

27
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,720
Turning every echo into

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,280
A symphony

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,320
And my heart's screaming loud

30
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:26,860
Yeah

31
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,960
Since you came around

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,720
Yeah

33
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,560
No I can't turn it down

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,220
When I'm fallin' apart

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,080
Yeah you're always

36
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,840
My safety net

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,580
Take a jump

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,140
Off the edge

39
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,640
And I know

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,400
That you'll never

41
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,160
Let me fall

42
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,180
And I don't mean

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,440
To push no

44
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,720
I just thought that

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,160
You should know

46
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,700
You take the weight

47
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,840
Off my mind

48
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,920
Oh

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,860
I'm seeing sound in colour

50
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,260
Yeah

51
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,480
Every time that I get around ya

52
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,480
Oh Oh Oh

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,720
No I'll never

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,480
Let you go

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,280
Colour

56
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,320
Colour

57
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,040
Colour

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,860
Oh

59
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,640
I'm seeing sound in colour

60
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,080
Everytime the I get around ya

61
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,540
Oh Oh Oh

62
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,340
No I'll never

63
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,280
Let you go

64
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,200
Oh I'm seeing sound in colour

65
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,880
Everytime that I get around ya

66
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,900
Oh Oh Oh

67
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,740
No I'll never

68
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,700
Let you go

69
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,280
Colour

70
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,380
Colour

71
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,480
Colour

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Colour
