1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,689
CHRISTIAN EVANGELIST PAT
ROBERTSON HAD A SOMEWHAT

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:06,700
SURPRISING TAKE ON THE GUN
CONTROL DEBATE WE ARE

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,410
HAVING, HE TENDS TO BE
PRETTY CONSERVATIVE AND

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,030
TRADITIONAL AND HAS KNEE-JERK
REACTIONS TO A LOT THAT'S

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,480
GOING ON BUT IN THIS CASE HE
MIGHT SURPRISE YOU.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,260
>>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM A
GUN OWNER, I HAVE HUNTED, I HAVE

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,520
SHOT SKEET, I HAVE GOT AWARDS
WHEN I WAS IN THE MARINE CORPS

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,550
FOR SHOOTING, I HAVE NO
OPPOSITION TO SHOOTING, BUT FOR

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,730
HEAVEN'S SAKE I DON'T THINK THE
GENERAL POPULATION NEEDS TO HAVE

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,800
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,780
IT JUST
DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE --

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,780
>>AMEN.

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,300
>>IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE
RUSSIAN BUILT OR CHINESE BUILT

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,170
MACHINE GUNS.

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,040
IT JUST DOESN'T.
IT'S ONE THING TO DEFEND

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,110
YOURSELF WITH A PISTOL OR
SHOTGUN, TO HUNT WITH.

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,110
IT'S

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,390
SOMETHING ELSE -- AND I THINK WE
COULD BAN THOSE THINGS WITHOUT

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,230
TOO MUCH TROUBLE, THEY HAVE WHAT
THEY CALL THE BUMP STOCK THAT

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:09,240
WOULD GO AUTOMATIC -- WE CAN
STOP THAT.

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,009
AND THERE HAS TO BE

22
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:16,340
SOME MEDICAL BACKGROUND CHECK,
IF SOMEBODY IS SEEING A

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:23,279
PSYCHIATRIST, IS ON MEDICATION,
HE OR SHE NEEDS TO BE PROHIBITED

24
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:26,770
FROM BEING TURNED LOOSE TO THE
GENERAL POPULATION.

25
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,770
IT'S JUST

26
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,680
GOT TO BE.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,590
IT'S SENSIBLE.

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,389
BUT AS
FAR AS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE

29
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:36,130
TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, THE
SECOND AMENDMENT, WE ARE

30
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,829
ALL FOR IT.

31
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,770
>>YOU KNOW THINGS OF GOTTEN
CRAZY WHEN WE AGREE WITH PAT

32
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,779
ROBERTSON, OR HE AGREES WITH US.

33
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:48,079
I THINK WE ARE GETTING THERE.

34
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,079
IF

35
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,479
WE BROKE THROUGH TO PAT
ROBERTSON, OR THE SHOOTINGS DID,

36
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,889
I THINK WE ARE NEAR THE MIDDLE
OF THE COUNTRY.

37
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:56,889
FOR THOSE OF YOU

38
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:59,580
UNFAMILIAR WITH AMERICA, BECAUSE
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE

39
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,289
COUNTRY WATCH US AS WELL, WE
HAVE THE REVERSE OF WHAT YOU

40
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,999
PROBABLY HAVE IN YOUR COUNTRY.

41
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,739
AND YOUR COUNTRY PROBABLY THE

42
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,629
RELIGIOUS LEADERS, THE NUNS,
PRIESTS, THE PREACHERS, ARE THE

43
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:14,180
FIRST TO CALL FOR NONVIOLENCE.

44
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,319
IN OUR COUNTRY THE PREACHERS ARE

45
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,659
THE LAST TO CALL FOR
NONVIOLENCE.

46
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:18,659
SO IS PAT

47
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,640
ROBERTSON, WHO HAS BEEN FOR WAR
AFTER WAR, AND DEVASTATION,

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,659
ETC., IF OUR RIGHT WING
PREACHERS ARE CALLING FOR

49
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,659
NONVIOLENCE, WOW.

50
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,930
THAT MEANS WE
HAVE REACHED NEAR THE BOTTOM OF

51
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,930
THE BARREL.

52
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,329
LIKE WE MIGHT
ACTUALLY BEGIN TO TURN AROUND.

53
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:40,209
AND ONE QUICK POINT ABOUT WHAT
HE SAID ABOUT LIMITING GUNS TO

54
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:43,959
PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH
ISSUES, HIS STANDARD WAS ANYONE

55
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:44,959
GOING TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST.

56
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,780
THAT WILL NEVER PASS, NOR SHOULD

57
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,780
IT PASS.

58
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,379
>>THAT'S WAY TOO FAR.

59
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,000
>>BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE REAL
STANDARD IS IN AMERICA NOW QUEST

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,180
BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU ARE BARRED
FROM BUYING A GUN IS IF A COURT

61
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,269
HAS ADJUDICATED YOU MENTALLY
INCOMPETENT AND AND CAPABLE OF

62
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:07,579
TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF, OR YOU
HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN A MENTAL

63
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:10,510
HOSPITAL AGAINST YOUR WILL.

64
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,749
AND
BY THE WAY, JUST SOME

65
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:14,870
ADJUDICATIONS OF MENTAL
INCOMPETENCE IS NOT ENOUGH.

66
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,870
FOR

67
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,280
EXAMPLE SOCIAL SECURITY SAYS
SOME PEOPLE ARE MENTALLY

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,871
INCOMPETENT AND CAN'T RECEIVE A
SINGLE DOLLAR ON THEIR OWN, THEY

69
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:24,870
MUST HAVE SOMEONE TAKE CARE OF
IT FOR THEM.

70
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,870
REPUBLICANS

71
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,409
OVERTURNED THAT LEGISLATION,
SAYING THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO

72
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,409
BUY A GUN.

73
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,349
THEY CAN'T CONTROL
THEIR OWN MONEY BUT THEY ARE

74
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,260
ALLOWED TO BUY AN AR-15.

75
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,709
A COURT
HAS TO SAY YOU ARE SO MENTALLY

76
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,219
UNBALANCED AND UNHINGED THAT YOU
AREN'T ALLOWED TO BUY A GUN.

77
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:46,170
WHICH IS THE CRAZIEST STANDARD,
I'M SURE IT'S THE MOST STRIDENT

78
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,360
STANDARD ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

79
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,670
SO PAT ROBERTSON HAS NO IDEA HOW

80
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,030
FAR AWAY HIS STANDARD IS FROM
THE ACTUAL STANDARD IN AMERICA.

81
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,639
WE LET CRAZY PEOPLE BUY GUNS
HERE ALL THE TIME.

82
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,810
>>I NOTICED IN THE BEGINNING OF
THAT VIDEO HE EITHER DID OR HAD

83
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,480
TO DO THIS THING THAT YOU HAVE
TO DO IN AMERICA, IF YOU WANT TO

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,410
BE ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT GUNS,
LET ALONE GUN CONTROL, YOU HAVE

85
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,329
TO GIVE YOUR RESUME.

86
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,569
SO YOU
DON'T GENERALLY SHOOT A LOT OF

87
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:15,909
GUNS, SO I WILL NEED YOU TO ZIP
IT ON THE GUNS.

88
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:16,909
I WILL SAY I'VE

89
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:21,599
NEVER OWNED A GUN BUT MY FATHER
OWNED A BUNCH, I HAD MY GUN OF

90
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,500
HIS, I'VE BEEN TARGET SHOOTING
MANY TIMES, I'VE BEEN SKEET

91
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,620
SHOOTING LIKE PAT ROBERTSON, SO
I'M ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT GUNS

92
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,449
ACCORDING TO THE TWISTED LOGIC
WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY.

93
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:31,449
AND

94
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,990
NOBODY NEEDS THESE ASSAULT
WEAPONS, IT'S RIDICULOUS.

95
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,990
IT'S

96
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,270
NOT JUST THE HUGE CLIPS, OR THE
ACCURACY, IT'S THE INCREDIBLE

97
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,419
DESTRUCTIVE POWER THEY HAVE EVEN
COMPARED TO SHOTGUNS AND

98
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:43,000
HANDGUNS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,680
I
WANT TO GIVE A TINY BIT OF

100
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,740
CREDIT TO ANDERSON COOPER, WHO I
DON'T NORMALLY GIVE CREDIT TO,

101
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,289
BUT HE POINTED OUT ON HIS SHOW
YESTERDAY THAT WE SANITIZE A LOT

102
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:56,389
OF THINGS IN THIS COUNTRY BUT
ONE THING WE SANITIZE MORE THAN

103
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:00,560
ANYTHING ELSE IS THE EFFECT OF
THESE GUNS.

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,650
PEOPLE THINK A

105
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,360
GUNSHOT IS A GUNSHOT, WHAT'S THE
DIFFERENCE?

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,430
A GUN IS A GUN.

107
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,430
IT'S

108
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,520
NOT LIKE YOU GOT SHOT AND YOU
HAVE A HOLE, THIS BLOWS BODY

109
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,919
PARTS OFF, IT DESTROYS TORSOS,
SHATTERS SKULLS.

110
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,449
AND I DON'T

111
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,800
KNOW HOW YOU GET THROUGH TO
PEOPLE, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE

112
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,560
DON'T WANT TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF
THIS, AND VERY FEW AMERICANS

113
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,819
SERVE IN THE MILITARY, BUT I
THINK IF PEOPLE SAW HOW UNIQUELY

114
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:28,449
DESTRUCTIVE THESE WEAPONS ARE
THEY WOULD NOT THINK THIS IS

115
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:29,819
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER WEAPON.

116
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:31,419
IT'S
NOT A RHETORICAL TRICK TO CALL

117
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:35,540
IN A WEAPON OF WAR, IT LITERALLY
IS IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD,

118
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:46,110
AND THANKFULLY PAT ROBERTSON IS
BEING INCLUDED 

119
00:05:46,110 --> 00:00:00,000
IN THAT NOW.
