SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT MID-TERM
ELECTION IN OUR LIFETIME.
JOINING US NOW, A MAN WHO
DESERVED A LOT OF CREDIT FOR
THIS MOMENT, SENATOR LINDSAY
GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
SENATOR, I’M HAPPY --
>> THANK YOU.
>> Sean: I’M HAPPY ABOUT THE
SUCCESS THE COUNTRY HAS HAD.
YOU TOLD ME WHEN I SAW YOU IN
WASHINGTON, I SAID, WHAT’S SUSAN
COLLINS LIKE, I SKPT YOU THE
QUESTION.
YOU SAID SHE IS SOMEBODY THAT
WILL SWAY HER, AND SHE WILL
WILL LOOK AT EVERY FACT, NOBODY
DECIDE, I THINK THAT WAS THE
MOST POWERFUL SPEECH I’VE SEEN
ON THE SENATE FLOOR.
>> WELL, IT’S HISTORIC.
IT CHANGED THE TRAJECTORY OF
WHERE WE’RE HEADED IN THE SENATE
IN TERMS OF CONFIRMING JUDGES.
SHE ADOPTED THE RULE OF LAW,
REJECTED THE RULE OF THE MOB.
IF I HAD TO TELL?
A GOOD REASON TO VOTE FOR JUDGE
KAVANAUGH, I WOULD ASK THEM TO
LOOK AT SUSAN’S SPEECH.
IT WAS INCREDIBLE IN DETAIL.
FORCEFULLY DELIVERED.
SHE DIDN’T LOOK LIKE SHE WAS
PAINED.
SHE HATED WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
PROCESS BUT SHE WAS CONFIDENT
THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS THE
RIGHT GUY AT THE RIGHT TIME.
I THINK SHE SAVED THE SENATE AND
THE ABYSS.
THE JUDICIARY FROM SLIDING INTO
>> Sean: YOU KNOW, SENATOR, I
ARGUE I DON’T THINK WE WOULD BE
HERE WITHOUT YOUR COURAGE.
BUT, NO, I’VE KNOWN YOU A LONG
TIME.
WE’VE HAD OUR DISAGREEMENTS.
>> I’M SURE WE WILL AGAIN.
>> Sean: THANKS, SENATOR.
I CAN’T WAIT FOR THE NEXT
BATTLE.
>> ME, TOO I’M GETTING TIRED OF
THE LOVEFEST CRAP.
>> Sean: THERE’S A LOT MORE ON
THE BALLOT IN 32 DAYS.
AM I WRONG?
I’M WORRIED ABOUT WHAT I’VE BEEN
WITNESSING.
>> THERE’S TWO CHOICES, THE
SUSAN COLLINS WAY OR THE
PROTESTER WAY.
WHO DO YOU WANT TO RUN THE
GOVERNMENT?
CONSERVATIVES ALIGNED WITH
SENATOR COLLINS, TRYING TO WORK
TOWARD EMPOWERING PEOPLE, MAKING
SENATOR COLLINS, TRYING TO WORK
TOWARD EMPOWERING PEOPLE, MAKING
US SAFE, MORE MONEY IN YOUR
POCKET.
OR DO YOU WANT TO TURN YOUR
GOVERNMENT OVER TO PEOPLE WHO
JUST YELL AND SPIT ON YOU.
TO ME, THIS IS A REALLY
IMPORTANT TIME IN AMERICAN
HISTORY.
IT’S NOW ALL ABOUT KAVANAUGH.
BEFORE IT WAS ABOUT A LOT OF
THINGS.
NOW IT’S PRETTY SIMPLE.
IF YOU VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY YOU’RE TURNING YOUR
GOVERNMENT OVER TO PEOPLE WHO
FOLLOW YOU AROUND, SPIT ON YOU,
TRY TO INTIMIDATE YOU F YOU KEEP
FOLLOW YOU AROUND, SPIT ON YOU,
TRY TO INTIMIDATE YOU F YOU KEEP
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN PLACE,
THAT MEANS THERE WILL BE AN
ALLIANCE BETWEEN SUSAN COLLINS
AND OTHERS TO KEEP US SAFE AND
MAKE OUR LIVES BETTER.
PRETTY SIMPLE CHOICE.
>> Sean: YOU KNOW, SENATOR, I
REALLY BELIEVE THIS, AFTER WHAT
WE’VE WITNESSED NOW, AND THIS
HAS BEEN BUILDING.
YOU GUYS, YOU HAVE TO CLEAR THE
HALLS, WHERE YOUR OFFICES ARE.
>> YES.
>> Sean: I HONESTLY FEAR
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET HURT
HERE.
>> ME TOO.
I’VE NEVER, YOU KNOW, WE’VE
BEEN, YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING I
LIKE ABOUT SENATOR COLLINS, IF
YOU THINK CAN YOU CHANGE HER
MIND BY YELLING AT HER AND
SHOWING UP AT HER HOUSE YOU’RE
DEAD WRONG.
AGAIN, I WANT TO COMPLIMENT HER,
FOR STOPPING WHAT I THOUGHT WAS
AGAIN, I WANT TO COMPLIMENT HER,
FOR STOPPING WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE CLOSEST THING TO McCARTHYISM
THE CLOSEST THING TO McCARTHYISM
IN MY LIFETIME, THAT A MAN IS
GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT,
FACTS DON’T MATTER, SMEARING HIM
EQUATES TO HIM BEING
DISQUALIFIED.
SHE STOOD TALL.
THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO
A GOOD MAN IS FOR A STRONG WOMAN
THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO
A GOOD MAN IS FOR A STRONG WOMAN
TO COME TO HIS AID.
THE AID OF AN INDEPENDENT
THAT’S EXACTLY -- SUSAN CAME TO
JUDICIARY TONIGHT.
>> Sean: IS IT TRUE THAT SENATOR
DAINS IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO
MAKE IT TO WALK HIS DAUGHTER
DOWN THE AISLE, YOU WORKED THAT
OUT?
>> I THINK THEY HAVE WORKED IT
OUT.
I WANT HIM TO BE ABLE TO DO
BOTH.
BUT WE’RE HUMAN BEINGS IS THE
POINT.
WE’RE NOT PERFECT.
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A HUMAN
BEING.
AND IT’S ALL GOING TO TURN OUT
WELL, GOD BLESS SUSAN COLLINS
AND JEFF FLAKE.
>> Sean: HONESTLY, THOSE THAT
FOOD UP FOR DUE PROCESS, THOSE
THAT STOOD UP FOR THE
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, I
THOUGHT WOULD BE SOMETHING WE
ALL AGREE AND APPARENTLY THIS IS
