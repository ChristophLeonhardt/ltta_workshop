Australia is a wonderful island with the
treasure trove of unique plants animals
and people it has to be protected
Australia is free of many pests and
diseases that are commonplace around the
world that is why Australia has to have
such strong biosecurity laws and
Australians are just as unique both warm
and direct when you disrespect
Australian law they will tell you firmly
I am truly sorry that pistol and Boo
were not declared protecting Australia
is important declared everything when
you enter Australian alright guys that
was great
I reckon people will think we're real
friendly
