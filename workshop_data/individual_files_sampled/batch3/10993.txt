the former Lebanese Prime Minister is in Paris and president McCrone invitation it follows his recent surprise resignation and speculation had been detained in Saudi Arabia ma let's get the details now let's cross live to Maria Sonu Sheila who's in Paris for ISM Maria what more do we know about this visit so far well yes the Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri has just arrived to the presidential Perry fellows here in Paris he is going to meet Frances president Emmanuel McCool and we also know that mr. Henry's family is going to join the two politicians for lunch later and this is actually all we know no details on how many days mr. hurry's planning to spend here in France or what exactly his plans here are well his visit to France is another twist in an old old bizarre story of his resignation that he announced earlier this month in a televised address while being on an official visit in Saudi Arabia the country that mr. Harry holds the second nationality off then mr. Harry has explained that the major reason behind his resignation is Iran's attempts to meddle into policies in Lebanon and in the region the Iranian backed political and military groups are indeed very influential in both inside the country and in the region and Iran has been a long-term enemy of Saudi Arabia the two powers have been sometimes heedless sometimes openly fighting for these influence and for the role that they wanted to play in the region and mr. hurry also mentioned that he fears for his life and for his family's safety but his resignation made in such a way sparked immediately speculation that he was held in Saudi Arabia against his will and he was forced to resign and that was the opinion that was shared by many politicians including in Lebanon including the country's president who did not accept the resignation saying that he could only do that if mr. hua comes back to Lebanon and mr. Hillary appeared in an interview shortly after that saying that he is a free man and he is free to leave this country and this is when he left Saudi Arabia for France and it seems that Frances president in Manama coal is considering him an acting Prime Minister this is what he stressed out many times let's take a listen what Emmanuel Macomb had to say about that check oh yes I don't I will therefore welcome him with the owners due to prime minister who has indeed stepped down but whose resignation has not been recognized in his country since he has not yet been there I will welcome him here as Prime Minister nonetheless well France has been playing a very important role in Lebanon this says Lebanon's former colonial ruler it has many many ties historically with this country and mr. Hariri has spend many years here in France before becoming Prime Minister he has a house here and even current president of Lebanon used to live here for 15 years in exile before he became president of Lebanon so it's not surprisingly that France decided to play a role in mediating role in this current situation that many tend to call crisis already in Lebanon and in the region but it is yet not clear exactly what will be discussed what steps could be taken following the meeting between Hariri and McCrone here in France and what further steps will be taken and how the situation will be developing so we have to wait and see but many now are speculating that this could be a very risky bet for France back to you okay Maria well like you said it's just another twist in this story well for now that societies Maria notion are from Paris with the latest on a Hillary's arrival there
