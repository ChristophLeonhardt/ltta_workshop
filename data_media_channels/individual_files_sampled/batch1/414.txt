Syria's military is preparing for possible air strikes by the United States and its allies and has been hiding aircraft moving its assets and evacuating potential targets including the Ministry of Defense and Army Headquarters in Damascus Western nations are promising a response following the suspected chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma Syrians living in rural areas welcome any attempt to punish and weaken the Syrian government but many in the opposition believe nothing will change they already emptied all the military airports before an attack this shows that all sides are conspiring against the Syrian people you're hearing about a possible US strike we don't believe anything the last time they hit nothing happened they even gave the regime advance notice to remove the planes if they hit again it will be limited it's been several days since US President Donald Trump promised a swift response for what he called an atrocious attack last year his administration carried out a one-off strike against Syria over the use of chemical weapons now the possibilities involve something more forceful but the presence of Iranian and Russian troops complicates the choice of targets there is a real risk of direct confrontation with the Russian military negotiations on the issue continued between the United States and Russian Federation and I think on all levels military political and governmental level I can't have a conclusion that Russia and America found themselves in the real deadlock they are facing a dangerous period to begin a war clash the so-called deconfliction hotline that the US and Russian militaries use in Syria to prevent a direct clash is being used the Kremlin however is not saying what is being discussed we understand that turkey a NATO member is acting as a communication channel between the Western alliance and Russia there are behind-the-scenes efforts to try to de-escalate what is being described as a day crisis a crisis that can lead to a confrontation between the United States and Russia as well as a showdown between Iran and Israel just days after Syria Russia and Iran accused Israel of attacking an airbase in the Syrian province of Homs Iran's top adviser to the supreme leader Ali Akbar WA lillah t traveled to Damascus Malaya t threatened to expel what he said were occupying US troops in Northeast Syria saying the area east of the Euphrates will be liberated Iran lost seven of its military personnel in Monday's strike not only did it promise a response its leadership promised to stand by Syria if it's attacked and it will be a limited strike it will be against military installations airfields and all of this and and things that can be repaired fairly quickly I think the American leadership will insist and and the European partners will insist that deterrence has to be reestablished and that means that the Syrian regime has to pay a price for that that price is unlikely to lead to the collapse of the Syrian government which is further consolidating its control after its victory in the Damascus suburb of eastern Hulda France has said if a decision is taken to launch a strike the government's chemical capabilities will be targeted and not Russian and Iranian assets the situation is unpredictable but one thing seems clear significant us-led military intervention to tip the balance of the conflict in favor of the opposition is not on the table
