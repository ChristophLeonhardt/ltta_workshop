>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
SPECIAL REPORT.
NOW REPORTING GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON BREAKING NEWS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER LAWYER 
MICHAEL COHEN HAS REACHED A PLEA
DEAL WITH PROSECUTORS ON SEVERAL
COUNTS OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
VIOLATIONS, BANK FRAUD AND TAX 
EVASION.
MICHAEL COHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
LONG TIME PERSONAL ATTORNEY AND 
COUNSEL.
IN THE 2016 CAMPAIGN HE WAS 
INVOLVED IN PAYMENTS TO STORMY 
DANIELS AS PART OF AN AFFAIR 
WITH MR. PRESIDENT TRUMP AS WELL
AS KAREN McDOcDOUGAL.
NOW HE'S AGREED TO PLEAD GUILTY.
ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES THIS 
WOULD INCLUDE A MONETARY 
FORFEITURE AND JAIL TIME FOR 
MR. COHEN.
WE WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE 
THOMAS.
THIS COULD BE FILED AS EARLY AS 
TODAY UP UNTIL THE TITLE IT'S 
FILED IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE ONE OR 
MORE PARTIES COULD BACK OUT.
WE BELIEVE AN AGREEMENT HAS BEEN
REACHED.
IT WOULD INCLUDE JAIL TIME FOR 
MICHAEL COHEN.
MUST SIGNIFICANT THE TWO 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW VIOLATIONS.
THAT INCLUDES DEALINGS WITH  
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT GEORGE.
WE BELIEVE THIS DEAL IS EMINENT.
EITHER PARTY COULD BACK OUT.
WE BELIEVE THE DEAL IS IMMINENT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATIONS 
ARE INTERESTING.
THEY INVOLVE HUSH MONEY 
INVOLVING WOMEN WHO ALLEGEDLY 
HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
AGAIN, THE TIMING WAS KEEPING 
THIS INFORMATION OUT OF THE 
PRESS BEFORE THE ELECTION, 
GEORGE.
THAT'S WHY IT'S KEY.
WE DON'T KNOW IF HIS COOPERATION
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT, 
GEORGE. 
>> THE PAYMENTS HE MADE WOULD BE
A CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION.
I ALSO WANT TO BRING IN CHRIS 
CHRISTIE FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW 
JERSEY.
FORMER U.S. PROSECUTOR AS WELL 
IN NEW JERSEY.
A LONG TIME ALLY ALSO OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
SIGNIFICANT MOVE HER TODAY, 
CHRIS?
>> IT IS A SIGNIFICANT MOVE, 
GEORGE.
THE REAL QUESTION NOW IS DOES 
THIS PLEA INCLUDE COOPERATION BY
MICHAEL COHEN.
IS IT A NONCOOPERATING PLEA 
WHERE HE'S LOOKING FOR CREDIT 
FOR ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY 
WHICH WOULD REDUCE HIS JAIL 
SENTENCE?
>> THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT.
ON THAT POINT EVEN IF THIS IS 
NOT A COOPERATING AGREEMENT IT 
DOESN'T PRECLUDE COOPERATING 
DOWN THE ROAD, CORRECT?
>> IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE IT.
ALTHOUGH, GEORGE, IF YOU'RE THE 
DEFENDANT YOU'VE WANT TO GET 
CREDIT FOR THAT COOPERATION 
RIGHT UPFRONT NOW.
THAT WOULD IMPACT HOW MANY 
COUNTS YOU HAVE TO PLEAD GUILTY 
TO AND WHAT LEVEL YOU'RE 
SENTENCED AT.
MY GUESS IS IS THIS IS A 
COOPERATING DEAL IT'S ALREADY 
BEEN STRUCK.
IF IT'S NOT, THAT'S SIGNIFICANT 
GOING DOWN THE ROAD. 
>> TALK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE 
IF IT'S NOT A COOPERATING DEAL. 
>> AGAIN, THAT MAKES IT LESS 
PROBLEMATIC FOR THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN.
IF MICHAEL COHEN IS NOT GOING TO
COOPERATE AND PROVIDE 
INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNMENT, 
THAT WOULD PUT MORE FLESH ON 
POTENTIAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
VIOLATIONS THAT MAKES ANY CASE 
AGAINST ANYONE ELSE IN THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO 
PURSUE AND PROVE WITH THE 
COOPERATION OF MICHAEL COHEN.
THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER. 
>> I WANT TO BRING IN CECELIA 
VEGA. 
>> WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT 
COOPERATION.
THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 
PEOPLE INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE 
FEAR THE MOST, THAT MICHAEL 
COHEN COOPERATING WITH ROBERT 
MUELLER'S TEAM WOULD BE A HUGE 
BLOW TO THIS WEST WING.
JUST MICHAEL COHEN BEING AT THE 
CENTER OF THE INVESTIGATION HAS 
MADE PEOPLE HERE NERVOUS.
IT'S HARD TO CONVEY HOW MUCH IN 
THE INNER CIRCLE MICHAEL COHEN 
WAS.
IN BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES HE WAS
HIS LONG TIME LAWYER, HE WAS HIS
LONG TIME FIXER, HE WAS HIS 
RIGHT HAND MAN.
AFTER THAT RAID ON COHEN'S HOME 
AND BUSINESSES WHERE THEY SEIZED
13 CELL PHONES AND MILLIONS OF 
FILES IN APRIL THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP TOOK A TURN SOUTH.
THE PRESIDENT SAID MICHAEL COHEN
WOULD NEVER FLIP ON HIM.
MICHAEL COHEN TOLD YOU GEORGE 
HIS LOYALTY LIES WITH HIS FAMILY
AND WITH HIS COUNTRY.
THERE ARE PEOPLE NERVOUS HERE 
WAITING TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS 
DEAL ENTAILS AND HOW MUCH HE'LL 
BE COOPERATING WITH ROBERT 
MUELLER'S TEAM. 
>> MICHAEL COHEN ADMITTED MAKING
PAYMENTS TO STORMY DANIELS OF 
$130,000 IN OCTOBER OF 2016 
BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN.
YOU REMEMBER WELL PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ON AIR FORCE ONE DENYING 
AT FIRST ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THAT 
PAYMENT.
LET'S LISTEN. 
>> Reporter: DID YOU KNOW ABOUT 
THE $130,000 PAYMENT TO STORMY 
DANIELS?
>> NO. 
>> Reporter: WHY DID MICHAEL 
COHEN MAKE THAT?
>> YOU HAVE TO ASK MICHAEL 
COHEN.
MICHAEL WAS MY ATTORNEY.
YOU HAVE TO ASK MICHAEL. 
>> Reporter: DO YOU KNOW WHERE 
HE GOT THE MONEY TO MAKE THAT 
PAYMENT?
I DON'T KNOW. 
>> THE WHITE HOUSE LATER HAD TO 
ADMIT HE DID KNOW ABOUT THE 
PAYMENT. 
>> HE FLATLY DENIED KNOWING 
ABOUT THE PAYMENT.
THEN IT CAME OUT THAT THIS MONEY
WAS REIMBURSED TO HIS LAWYER FOR
THAT $130,000.
WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT KAREN 
McDOUGAL AND THAT MONEY PAID TO 
AMI.
THAT TAPE CAME OUT WHERE WE 
HEARD THE PRESIDENT AND MICHAEL 
COHEN TALKING ABOUT THE PAYMENT,
HUSH MONEY.
THE PRESIDENT INSISTED THEY 
DIDN'T HAVE THE AFFAIR.
THERE'S A TAPE OUT THERE TALKING
ABOUT THAT PAYMENT. 
>> WE HAVE THAT TAPE.
LET'S PLAY THAT AS WELL. 
>> I NEED TO OPEN UP A COMPANY 
FOR THE TRANSFER OF ALL THAT 
INFO REGARDING OUR FRIEND DAVID.
I'M GOING TO DO THAT RIGHT AWAY.
>> GIVE IT TO ME.
>> I'VE SPOKEN TO ALAN ABOUT HOW
TO SET THE WHOLE THING UP WITH 
FUNDING. 
>> WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
>> IT'S ALL THE STUFF.
YOU NEVER KNOW THAT COMPANY -- 
>> HE COULD GET HIT BY A TRUCK. 
>> CORRECT.
I'M ALL OVER THAT.
WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR THE 
FINANCING -- 
>> WHAT FINANCING?
>> WE'LL HAVE TO PAY. 
>> DON'T PAY WITH CASH. 
>> NO.
>> I WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE 
THOMAS.
WE ALSO KNOW THE OFFICES OF 
AMERICA MEDIA HAVE ALSO BEEN 
RAIDED BY THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT. 
>> THEY WANT TO GET AS MUCH 
INFORMATION FROM THEM AS 
POSSIBLE.
GEORGE, WE DON'T KNOW THE 
SPECIFICS YET OF THIS DEAL IN 
TERMS OF HOW MUCH COOPERATION 
THERE WILL BE.
WE HAVE HAD FROM SOURCES THAT WE
TRUST THAT COHEN HAS SIGNALLED 
THAT HE WANTED TO COOPERATE.
HE WANTED TO SHARE WHAT HE KNEW 
TO POSSIBLY HELP HIS SITUATION. 
>> CHRIS CHRISTIE, LET'S TAKE A 
STEP BACK HERE.
WE'RE HEARING A PLEA AGREEMENT 
FROM THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER 
PERSONAL ATTORNEY ON THE SAME 
DAY THE SAME DAY PAUL MANAFORT 
EXPECTING TO FACE A VERDICT 
PERHAPS AS EARLY AS THIS 
AFTERNOON FROM A JURY.
THE PRESIDENT IS FEELING -- HE'S
GOT TO BE FEELING THE PRESSURE 
THERE.
WE'VE SEEN IT IN HIS TWEETS. 
>> GEORGE, A COUPLE THINGS.
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER ANY 
COOPERATION AT THE MOMENT IS 
WITH THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF 
NEW YORK AND NOT BOB MUELLER.
BOB MUELLER SENT THIS CASE TO 
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW 
YORK.
HE THOUGHT IT WAS BEYOND HIS 
MANDATE THAT HE GOT FROM DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROSENSTEIN.
AS FOR THE PRESIDENT, IT'S NEVER
GOOD TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT WERE 
ASSOCIATED WITH YOU LIKE MICHAEL
COHEN HAVING TO PLEAD GUILTY TO 
CRIMES AND IT APPEARS CRIMES 
THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
THIS IS NOT A GOOD DAY AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE.
LET US NOT ALSO OVER REACT.
AT THIS POINT THERE'S NOTHING 
THAT IMPLICATES THE PRESIDENT OR
ANYONE ELSE OTHER THAN MICHAEL 
COHEN AND SO IT'S SOMETHING 
WHERE EVERYBODY JUMPS TO 
CONCLUSIONS.
I LEARNED AS A PROSECUTOR TAKE 
IT ONE STEP AT A TIME. 
>> CHRIS CHRISTIE, PIERRE 
THOMAS, CECELIA VEGA, THANKS 
AGAIN.
