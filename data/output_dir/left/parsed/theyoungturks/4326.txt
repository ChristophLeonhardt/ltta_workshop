LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT
HIM.
DOWN GOES THE MOOCH.
ALL RIGHT.
AS USUAL, IN THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WE
DIDN'T GET HIM, THEY GOT
THEMSELVES.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A FIRING SQUAD
THIS CIRCULAR BEFORE IN MY LIFE.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE -
ACTUALLY, IF YOU WENT ON
VACATION FOR JUST LIKE FOUR DAYS
YOU ARE GOING TO COME BACK
TO, WHAT IN THE WORLD JUST
HAPPENED?
EVERY SINGLE DAY, DAMAGE REPORT.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT
BEEN KEEPING TRACK, LET ME GET
YOU UP-TO-DATE REAL QUICK.
10 DAYS AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP
BRINGS IN ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI,
AN OLD FRIEND WHO BY
THE WAY, DID NOT SUPPORT HIM
EARLIER IN THE PRIMARIES, INTO
THE WHITE HOUSE AS THE WHITE
HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR.
SEAN SPICER IS VERY MAD ABOUT
THAT.
HE QUITS AS PRESS
SECRETARY.
HE WAS ACTUALLY ALSO
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR SO
THAT IS TWO COMMUNICATIONS
DIRECTOR DOWN.
SCARAMUCCI AND REINCE PRIEBUS,
THE CHIEF OF STAFF, IS
CALLED A PARANOIAC
AND EVERY CURSE WORD IN A
INTERVIEW WITH RYAN LIZZA, HE
CHARGES REINCE PRIEBUS WITH
COCK BLOCKING HIM AND HE SAYS,
HE THREATENS TO FIRE EVERYONE IN
THE COMMUNICATIONS TEAM AND
THE FIRST REPORTS ARE THAT
TRUMP LOVES IT BECAUSE
SCARAMUCCI IS BEING TOUGH AND
LO AND BEHOLD, BOOM.
APPARENTLY, IT IS TRUE
BECAUSE REINCE PRIEBUS IS FIRED,
AND ITíS SCARAMUCCI.
AND THEN
THEY BRING IN A NEW CHIEF
OF STAFF, JOHN KELLY.
HE WAS THE
HEAD OF HOMELAND SECURITY,
FORMER GENERAL, THEY BRING HIM
IN AND HE IS GOING TO
BRING LAW AND ORDER FOR THEM.
SCARAMUCCI IS STILL THERE.
UNTIL TODAY, NOW HE IS OUT.
THIS IS WRESTLING.
THEYíRE ON THE SAME SIDE
THROWING EACH OTHER OUT
OF THE RING.
IT IS
UNBELIEVABLE, UNPRECEDENTED.
JUST THE DAY BEFORE.
SCARAMUCCI SENT OUT THIS TWEET:
HAD A GREAT CALL WITH GOP
CHAIRWOMAN.
GOP DOING FANTASTIC WORK TO
SUPPORT POTUS.
LOOKING FORWARD TO BUILDING
AN EVEN STRONGER RELATIONSHIP.
WRONG, YOU HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP.
YOUíRE FIRED.
WE'LL GET TO THE COMICAL
EXCUSES IN A MOMENT.
THIS
MORNING, TRUMP TWEETED, HIGHEST
STOCK MARKET EVER.
I KNOW, HE BUILT IT OVERNIGHT.
IT HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PREVIOUS
EIGHT YEARS LEADING UP TO IT.
BEST ECONOMIC NUMBERS IN YEARS,
UNEMPLOYMENT WITHIN 17 YEARS,
WHICH IS RAISING.
WHATEVER.
SUPREME COURT, NO
WHITE HOUSE CHAOS AND THEN THIS
AFTERNOON, WHITE HOUSE CHAOS.
SCARAMUCCI FELT IT
WAS BEST TO GIVE CHIEF OF STAFF
JOHN KELLY A CLEAN SLATE AND THE
ABILITY TO BUILD HIS OWN TEAM.
WE WISH HIM ALL THE BEST.
NONE OF THAT IS TRUE.
THE GUY SOLD HIS
HEDGE FUND.
HE SOLD HIS OWN
COMPANY.
THEN HE WENT ON SAY, I
DIDN'T REALLY WANT IT.
ALL 
THE
INTENSITY 
AND I WAS
TELLING YOU 
DONALD TRUMP 
IS THE BEST.
AS SOME POINT THIS IS GOING TO
COME BACK TO BITE DONALD TRUMP.
WHEN YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO
LOYALTY TO ANYONE
EVER.
HE IS DOING IT TO JEFF SESSIONS
AS WE SPEAK AND THAT IS HIS
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
BY THE WAY,
SCARAMUCCI SAID HE IS GOING
TO FIRE EVERYBODY.
SO I'M GOING
TO DO IT.
YOU ARE GOING
TO STOP LEAKING OR YOU ARE GOING
TO BE FIRED.
TURNED OUT
TO BE THE OTHER WAY ACTUALLY.
AND THEY ARE STILL LEAKING.
BY THE WAY, TRUMP, IF YOU SAID
YOU GOT THIS NEW ENFORCER
AND YOU ARE GOING TO STOP THE
LEAKS, BUT YOU FIRE HIM,
THAT ENCOURAGES EVERYONE ELSE.
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MESS.
THIS IS THE ENTIRETY OF THE
STORY, TRUMP RAN HIS
WHOLE CAMPAIGN ON, OUR COUNTRY IS
A MESS.
WEíRE NOT WINNING ANYMORE.
MY GOD, IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A
MESS BEFORE, WAIT UNTIL YOU
GET A HOLD OF THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.
NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN INCOMPETENCE
LIKE THIS AND YOU
WONDER WHY HE WENT BANKRUPT SIX
TIMES.
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
KNOW HOW TO MANAGE ANYTHING.
HIS DADDY LEFT HIM $200 MILLION,
AND THAT IS WHY WE HAD TO
BORROW MONEY FROM THE RUSSIANS.
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MANAGE
ANYTHING.
HE COULDN'T MANAGE
HIS WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG.
FROM TIME MAGAZINE.
AN INSTANT
TELEVISION CELEBRITY, SCARAMUCCIíS
OBSEQUIOUS DISPLAYS OF
LOYALTY PLEASED THE PRESIDENT,
BUT HIS ASTONISHING RISE ALSO
THREATENED TO OVERSHADOW THE
PRESIDENT.
WHAT A
PATHETIC HUMAN BEING DONALD
TRUMP IS.
HE IS LIKE, YOU DID A GOOD JOB
THERE KISSING UP TO ME, BUT
NOW YOU ARE BECOMING A LITTLE
BIT OF A CELEBRITY ESPECIALLY IN
INTERVIEW BECAUSE OF THE
CURSING BUT NOW EVERYONE IS
PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU AND NOT ME.
THINK ABOUT HOW FRAGILE YOUR EGO
HAS TO BE.
SOMEBODY IN MY TEAM IS DOING
WELL.
IF YOU THOUGHT SCARAMUCCI WAS
DOING WELL YOU HAVE ANOTHER
PROBLEM TOO, BUT APPARENTLY
TRUMP AGREED.
HE THOUGHT
HE WILL BE TOUGH,
THEN IS LIKE WAIT A MINUTE,
SOMEBODY PAID ATTENTION TO HIM
FOR A SECOND LONGER THAN ME.
HE HAS TO GO.
YOU HAVE TO BE
THE MOST INSECURE MAN IN
AMERICA.
BUT I'M NOT POSITIVE
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED.
YESTERDAY JOHN KELLY, THE NEW
GUY AND I THINK OF COURSE THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA LOVES HIM.
WE GO TO CNN.
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL SAID
SCARAMUCCI WAS REMOVED
FROM HIS NEW ROLE AS THE
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR
BECAUSE HE DID NOT THINK HE WAS
DISCIPLINED AND HAD BURNED
HIS CREDIBILITY.
TO BE FAIR, THAT IS TRUE ENOUGH.
JOHN KELLY IS QUITE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.
AND FINALLY,
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID
GENERAL KELLY HAS 
A FULL
AUTHEORITY.
SCARAMUCCI DIDN'T BEND A KNEE,
BUT HE IS GONE.
THEY CLAIM THAT JARED KUSHNER,
IVANKA TRUMP, AND STEVE BANNON
ARE NOW ALL REPORTING TO THE
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF
WHICH IS HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO
BE.
LET'S SEE HOW THAT TURNS OUT.
ALL THEM ARE SAYING JOHN KELLY,
A MAN OF DISCIPLINE.
WE LOVE
GENERALS.
GOOD LUCK TRYING TO GET STEVE
BANNON UNDER CONTROL.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, FIRE
THE PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER?
THIS WAS NEVER GOING TO END
BECAUSE AS SCARAMUCCI APTLY
PUT IT WHEN HE WAS REFERRING TO
REINCE PRIEBUS, THIS FISH
ROTS FROM THE HEAD DOWN.
