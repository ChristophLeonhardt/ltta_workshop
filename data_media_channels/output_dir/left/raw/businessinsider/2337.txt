00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,460
we're back and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> joined by Andrew</font>

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,839
Barron who's the co-founder of

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,119
rocketboom which was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

4
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,490
web video series i started watching five

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,240
or six<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago and you're still around</font>

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,350
you had to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> sony where they</font>

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,240
were selling your ads for a while and

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,830
and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess you're doing direct</font>

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,539
sales how are you keeping the lights on

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,800
how are you making<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough money to keep</font>

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,190
funding and keep shooting well you have

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,149
just by doing direct sales and you know

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,030
that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be going pretty well and</font>

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,730
just kind of essentially just growing at

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,410
the pace of the market instead of over

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,329
growing too fast we haven't ever taken

17
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,079
any venture capital and so we're not

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,829
under the pressure or the clock to you

19
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,300
know bring in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain amount of</font>

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">revenue and it essentially is taking a</font>

21
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,420
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer you know to make this</font>

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,200
transformation and media it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,900
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Silicon Valley pace you know of</font>

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,880
investment cycles it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer</font>

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,430
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making sure that</font>

26
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,250
we go at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that pace and you're expanding</font>

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,680
your doing more shows now know<font color="#E5E5E5"> your meme</font>

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,299
is one of the newer ones it's one of my

29
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,619
favorites what else you doing in terms

30
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,780
of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of branching out beyond besides</font>

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,829
the original rocketboom we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

32
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,689
rocketboom<font color="#E5E5E5"> tech which is starting to</font>

33
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,659
branch off a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we also have a</font>

34
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,240
really significant effort called human

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,810
wire that we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on where our</font>

36
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,759
field reports that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing over</font>

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,409
the years<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> correspondents</font>

38
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,530
in different areas around the world

39
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,290
we've accumulated probably about a

40
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,399
hundred hundred and fifty now actually

41
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,720
correspondence and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,140
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out once a day so so we've</font>

43
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,329
all seen how huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube is obviously</font>

44
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,009
and some of the smaller players have

45
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,890
kind of fallen off but I'm curious you

46
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,689
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we still going to see a shake</font>

47
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,758
out in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years where some</font>

48
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:09,649
more the web

49
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,170
aggregators go away you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

50
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,819
they've kind of shifted their business

51
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,370
model I know blip TV has kind of here in

52
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,230
New York<font color="#CCCCCC"> has focused more on advertising</font>

53
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,200
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of behind the scenes things as</font>

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,670
opposed to trying to compete with

55
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube there's other companies like</font>

56
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">viddler that you know that are out there</font>

57
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,629
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with with vo and</font>

58
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:32,099
dailymotion and all these guys who's

59
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,750
going to stick around and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

60
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,659
couple years well you know some of them

61
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,670
have found nice niche audiences like

62
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,269
Vimeo is a good example where people

63
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:44,340
that are into the more sort of the

64
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">artistic side or filmmaking side of</font>

65
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,349
doing online video and want more out of

66
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,519
a player like they tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> migrate that</font>

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,769
way or just like different<font color="#E5E5E5"> communities</font>

68
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:58,139
to sort of the vimeo also kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of goes</font>

69
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,030
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> with like the tumblr community a</font>

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,669
little bit and they all kind of hook in

71
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:04,790
around together obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> who lose</font>

72
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,780
significant because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the kind of</font>

73
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,900
content that they have there some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

74
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,959
other ones you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we'll have to see</font>

75
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,190
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of them are looking</font>

76
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,019
to do things maybe more like what

77
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brightcove is doing where maybe they can</font>

78
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a few customers than they can handle</font>

79
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:26,790
their the video players for people who

80
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,519
are keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> their video on their own</font>

81
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,370
sites how about advertising you know the

82
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,919
players have come a long way are the

83
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,470
advertisers and their agencies and who's

84
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever representing them are they now</font>

85
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,669
savvy enough for web video to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

86
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:44,790
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> more byes and bigger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by sure so</font>

87
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,199
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google is not the only one making</font>

88
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,989
money here oh yeah sure I mean it's

89
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:51,419
really there's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much activity out</font>

90
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,229
there it's it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a matter of doing</font>

91
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:57,329
the work<font color="#E5E5E5"> to going out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know in</font>

92
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:58,829
getting it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and starting the relations</font>

93
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you know calling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them or they</font>

94
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:03,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">calling you these days absolutely both</font>

95
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:08,400
yeah I mean it's it's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> incoming</font>

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then also when we think of things we</font>

97
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,169
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have our sort of sense of what we</font>

98
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,720
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ideal and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so will always go</font>

99
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,298
after those cool and you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Newport</font>

100
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,579
newer project called magma which is you

101
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,000
know too

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,800
to the user is basically a dashboard of

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,210
here are the videos that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

104
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">become the most popular you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

105
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,330
viral videos that all your friends are

106
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,980
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sending around tomorrow or</font>

107
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,620
the day after tell me a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more</font>

108
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,930
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of who's it for and</font>

109
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,490
how are you going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that into a</font>

110
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,880
business too yeah that's I mean the main

111
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,190
problem is that we've identified and

112
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,050
being a publisher and doing rocketboom

113
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,470
all these years is that whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

114
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,350
upload a video like to youtube or to

115
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,030
wherever then the next thing you want to

116
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,740
do is start tracking it and figuring out

117
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's talking about it and what are the</font>

118
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,210
tweets you know that are being mentioned

119
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,000
what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over to</font>

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,310
technorati or you go get google blog

121
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,750
alerts and you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

122
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the terms and it just goes on and on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

123
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,410
on trying to collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> data for every</font>

124
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">single video and then you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

125
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data to go back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show the</font>

126
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,130
marketer so that you can boast you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

127
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,590
a higher CPM essentially so it's all

128
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,030
directly relative to your value and so

129
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,130
there's really nowhere you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

130
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,340
publisher standpoint there's no way to

131
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,169
do that or there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no tools or anything</font>

132
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,890
for us right now that make that simple

133
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,979
and so you're building a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a tool</font>

134
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,840
for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people it's for the user</font>

135
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
who wants to watch video and see neat

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,610
videos but also for the publisher and

137
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the potential advertiser who wants to</font>

138
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,560
see stats about individual videos videos

139
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,990
and aggregate what people are saying

140
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,490
about them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that yeah</font>

141
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,220
exactly cool well<font color="#CCCCCC"> yan forward to seeing</font>
