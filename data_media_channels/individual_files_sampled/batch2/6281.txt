so we already know that some Republicans are going to support Donald Trump if he fires Robert Muller in fact some of them are encouraging him do that today Matt Gaetz said that Malo should be fired he's a Republican in Congress Jim Jordan was on Fox News agreeing with Jeanine Pirro on her insane rant to lock up members of the FBI and imprison people that don't agree with Donald Trump and so they're ready they got their nice little crisp shirts that are brown fitted and ready to go and they're willing to break the law subvert the law do whatever it is to protect their leader so the question is if Trump does that he fires more likely Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General so that he'll find hire someone else who can fire robert muller he says he's not going to but that's what he said before Comey so I don't believe him at all I think it's just a matter of if he thinks Mahler's got him then he'll definitely fire him because he knows that it's really bad that's what a lot of Republicans don't understand they think why is Trump going through all this stuff man he's got really thin skin no there's a much easier explanation it's because he did it that's why he's saying man if you knew what I knew you try to fire Muller - so the question is what will the rest of the Republicans do first layer the question is it will the Democrats have enough backbone to actually go to impeachment if Donald Trump fires his own investigator well we've got a petition up on that TYT Network comm / obstruction it says if Donald Trump fires Muller you should be impeached for obstruction of justice so very easy very obvious every democratic in the country should agree to that my guess is a lot of them won't because they never fight and then we're gonna need on top of every Democrat some Republicans to break away and go we gotta have we have to have the rule of law and if we don't if these guys aren't going to follow the Constitution we're not gonna have an America left will they do that well like I said so far some of the signs are really bad with guys like Jordan in gates looking to do purchase of the FBI and eliminate what they view to be their opponents on the other hand there are some more cautious notes GOP senator Lankford said obviously I don't think it it taints the entire process referring to the so-called controversy about the transition emails which the Muller team had every legal right to get it's a made-up nonsense controversy and he says it doesn't paint the whole process meaning no you don't have to fire Muller and then John Koerner a very important Republican leader in the Senate was on television this weekend let's see what he had to say I have a lot of admiration and respect for director Muller but I would think he would want to eliminate challenges to the integrity of his investigation by eliminating agents who have taken positions either in text messages or through their political activity the appearance of justice needs to be done and I think of these conflicts of interest jeopardized the integrity of his investigation so the text messages he's referring to is from two agents who already were asked to leave the investigation a minute that Muller found out about those text messages by the way those text messages were anti Donald Trump definitely they were pre-election but they also have some messages that were against Hillary Clinton and definitely against Bernie Sanders so apparently those agents didn't like anybody in politics but they're not part of the investigation so it should be an issue but it's Koerner gonna use it as an excuse well Stephanopoulos is gonna follow up by asking him about that the FBI agent who was engaged in those text messages both of them have been taken off the investigation they were taken off apparently as soon as Special Counsel Muller found out about them and I commend it for that he should and but there ought to be there are others who he needs to make sure he vets that team yeah I think he did bet the team and then who said they're not on the team anymore as soon as he found out about the text messages okay so by the way should we also take off all the FBI agents who were pro Trump from the investigation because you might have to eliminate a lot of them because according to most people that worked at FBI that have spoken to the press huge majorities of the FBI voted for Trump and our Republicans okay and then at the end though this is the most important part should Donald Trump fire Muller if Cornyn says yes that is a sign of Republican leadership going do whatever you have to do fire anyone you got to don't worry about the rule of law so this is going to be vital let's see what he says it appears that some of the president's allies in the Congress are starting to lay the groundwork for him to fire Robert Muller what would that mean if the president fired the special counsel well I've read that the president's own lawyer says that's not gonna happen I think that would be a mistake myself okay look you never know he might change his mind later and Republicans have been known to do that but furthermore being he said that would be a mistake that's really good so for the moment being Republican leadership in the Senate telling Trump we will not have your back if you go above the law if you break the law and then fire the people investigating you it would be a mistake let's hope that they stick with that position so that there is accountability in this country and that the constitution still stands what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it you can get a completely ad free if you could become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm slash joint
