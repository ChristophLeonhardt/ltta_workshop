you
it knows about just when I travel I tend
to stray off my diet but uh in the
mornings I'm I mostly have like fruits
and I I could my coach let me have
anything in the mornings I can have
starch or whatever I want anyone what's
in the evening before I go to bed he
always says make sure I just get protein
and vegetables so let's see any form of
meat and vegetables doesn't have in
evenings but show the day like because I
need the energy for training I can
pretty much have anything I want like
rice or dumplings or whatever I want so
yeah everything you're told more
