“I’m Boots Riley.
I’m the writer and director
of "Sorry to Bother You."
This is our main
telemarketing floor.
Lakeith Stanfield
plays Cassius Green,
who has recently
discovered a magical power
to make his voice
sound like it’s
overdubbed by a white actor.
And this is his
first successful sale
using that white
voice, which disguises
the fact that he’s actually
black to the callers.
We needed this so that
he could own his success,
and we could feel
happy for him."
“Spin Doctors, classic —
Tim, I want to
chop it up more,
but I got to get
to my squash game.
Was that Visa or Mastercard?"
Narrator: We’re about to see Michael
X. Sommers, as his manager
Johnny, who
actually only lives
two blocks away from
where it was shooting.
He’s local, but I don’t
think he’s going to be local
very much any more.
He’s a great actor.
And there are two
crazy actors who
this scene shows how great
two crazy people could
be together.
This is a scene that we had
14 wardrobe changes for.
And it’s the kind of
scene that indie producers
would like to cut out because
it costs a lot of money.
You don’t usually
have stuff like this.
And the question is,
why do you need it?
But we need it because we need
to ride this wave with him."
“All movies should have
a high-five montage
and this one, the music
that’s playing is by my band
The Coup.
And it’s called, ‘Oh
Yeah All Right Hell Yeah
That’s Tight.'"
