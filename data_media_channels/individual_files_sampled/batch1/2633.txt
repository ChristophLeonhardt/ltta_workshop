it's kind of obvious but it bears repeating caffeine just before bed it's not a good idea doctors recommend no caffeine after 2:00 p.m. we think that having a nightcap having a drink is going to relax us and be like a sedative and it does act like a sedative at the beginning but then shortly after we fall asleep it changes allegiances and wakes us up food is another culprit if we have a big meal and then go straight to bed our sleep is not going to be as restorative because our digestive system is occupied digesting there's nothing worse to have just before you go to sleep in sugar if you want something soothing a kind of Arabic tea I love lavender tea and lavender has through the ages again been seen as something that promotes sleep and promotes a kind of relaxing feeling any kind of light in the room investing in some curtains that really block the light is totally worth it turn off all my devices and gently escort them out of my bedroom disconnecting from technology means disconnecting from our daily lives with all the challenges and the obstacles that we all face and then in bed I only read physical books I don't read on my iPad or on any screen your sleep is going to be so much deeper and so much more restorative that it's totally worth it
