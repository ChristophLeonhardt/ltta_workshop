the House Intelligence Committee has not been getting along they're supposed to be investigating whether Russians are interfered in our elections that's a tricky and interesting question there's a lot of facets to that devyn newness is the chair of that committee but he is not interested in nuance and he's not interested in an objective reading of of the evidence in fact he sometimes brags that he doesn't even read the evidence he's like I don't know I gave it to Gowdy said nothing Republican on the committee he knows her better than I do but anyway I'm the one who wrote the memo well how'd you write the memo he don't look at the evidence whatever he is part of Trump's transition team so he wrote the ridiculous partisan memo that the Republicans on the committee put out the Democrats showed a different memo which pointed to actual evidence etc but obviously they're not getting along so notice the genius came up with a new plan in CBS exploits in a sign of increasing partisan hostilities Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee plan to construct a wall a physical partition separating Republican and Democratic staff members and the committee's secure spaces according to multiple committee sources what it's not symbolic its literal they are going to put up some concrete and they're going to build a wall between the Republicans and Democrats on the committee the only question that remains is whether Mexico is gonna pay for it now first of all their intelligence committee is supposed to be nonpartisan and they're supposed to do investigations and keep the country's best interests in mind not their own political parties laugh along with me no one believes that I don't believe it on the Republican side I don't believe it on the Democratic side so do they leak from time to time of course they do do they have their own partisan agenda of course they do right but they literally build a wall between the Republicans Democrats on the same committee it's just insanity even Republicans who were asked about it were like John I didn't know about that man it ain't me it was me one me as soon is about it and then one more from CBS here for now some Republican Committee members deny knowing anything about it while strongly suggesting the division is the brainchild of the committee's chairman Devin newness they say brainchild because they're like it's not very bright so it didn't occur to him that building an actual wall in a committee meeting might not be a great idea especially in America if you liked this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
