it's the same thing it's it's it's ridiculous how they always go after the legal gun owner the legal gun owner isn't the criminal the legal gun owner isn't the one that won't goes down and shoots up the Danforth well Toronto is experiencing yet another summer of the gun in fact 2018 might be a record year for homicides and in light of the mass shooting on Danforth Avenue last month the City Council in Toronto their solution to this was to look at means in which they could ban the sale of guns and ammunition in the City of Toronto and you know folks it's only a matter of time before they also legislate out of existence their few remaining shooting ranges that are in Toronto such as this building here the Toronto revolver club well I'm with Meredith cutting he is the past president the immediate past president of the Tonto revolver club and first of all Meredith what do you make of the city's knee-jerk reaction that all these you know criminal acts using firearms will go away if we simply have a gun and ammunition ban in the 4-1 six well the biggest problem with it is that they don't learn by history people that don't learn history or study history are bound to repeat it they did a height of a firearms ban in Australia and their crime rate went up by roughly 400 percent so by taking away the firearms from legal gun owners they're not going to do anything because criminals don't register guns criminals don't buy guns from a registered source they don't have any concept and respect for the law and they're going to do as they wish now Meredith do you challenge merit or aeon his recent statements about 50% of the guns used in gun crime in Toronto come illegally from the US but the other 50% are bought legally and they're trafficked to the criminals where are those numbers from into the pasture sniff test well statistics are very misleading let's let's use you and I as an example you're from Toronto I'm from Toronto we're from Toronto you're from the East End I'm from the West End 50% of us are from the East End 50% of us are from the West End still only two people it's misleading the this business we're a statistic if you want to call it that being 50% of the firearms used in crime in Toronto are from legal sources how many guns is that and what 50% are we talking about is it 20 50 % of the 20 is that all the guns that were seized over the past year and 50 % of that and where did this information come from if you or I as a legal gun owner who happens to have a registered gun goes in sells it or gives it to somebody who does not have a licence and who does not register it the onus comes back on the person who's registered why would anybody in their right mind do that also Meredith how do you react to the response that and you hear it off repeated these days especially in light of the mass shootings that we've had in this city that there is absolutely no reason why somebody living in the City of Toronto should own a gun period legal or otherwise how do you respond to that with frustration laughing the majority of people that own a firearm are sport shooters they are involved in nothing more than punching holes in paper the hard way at a certain distance competing with their fellow shooters and they do nothing wrong they do nothing wrong they're not out there shooting up the city they own a firearm for one reason and one reason only and that's to compete sportingly and hoops and hurdles that we have to go through to own those firearms are phenomenally magnanimous it's huge what a sports shooter has to go through so pardon the pun target the proper entity target the criminal target the illegal firearm don't target the innocent because you're not going to accomplish anything so by having a ban the only thing that it does is it subjugates the innocent and the thing is is they're looking at the wrong thing they're going after the tool not the person who uses the tool we have laws in this country that are very good enforce the laws don't back down on the charge lay the charge follow through on the charge but leave the innocent person alone because it's the innocent person that does no wrong America that we should point out that in addition to being a gun aficionado in a previous life you were a veteran Toronto police officer you've been on the streets firsthand tell me from your policing experience if this ban were to go through in the City of Toronto you know no more gun sales no more ammunition does it make one scintilla of difference in terms of the gangbangers out there and the alleged terrorists committing these terrible acts of violence it won't change a thing as a matter of fact if anything the crime rate will go up the crime rate will go up and it and it's proven historically it happened in England it happened in Australia the crime rate went up once firearms ammunition were banned for them to do that here in the city it's not going to make an iota of difference not one way or the other there's this perception that if the the citizenry is armed there's not going to be as much proliferation a crime because of the fear factor from the criminal aspect if there are no guns if there are no weapons if there are no swords there are no knives well it's open season you can just go and create mayhem and whatever you want because there's nobody gonna be able to stop you and hey 911 police officer get there unfortunately that today's policing is more reactionary than proactive which is a shame because and I've seen it because my oldest son is on the job and they go to a scene after it's happened not before which is unfortunate and it's due to manpower it's due to the fact that a lot of the policing powers have been taken away the investigative tools have been taken away from most police officers that are on the street and as a result you see what's happening you know I mean it's it's the same thing it's it's it's ridiculous how they always go after the legal gun owner the legal gun owner isn't the criminal the legal gun owner isn't the one that won't goes down and shoots up the danforth the legal gun owner has to go through what I said all the hoops and hurdles you have to go and the only way you can use your firearm is at a registered approved range who approves it the province the Ministry the only time you can take it out is when you're going from your home to the range and the thing is is that legal gun owners follow those rules illegal gun owners don't care they stick it in their waistband put it in their pocket and go out and create mayhem okay so why are these good meaning politicians they mean well don't get us wrong we know that they mean well and they're doing the very best they can in a very bad situation but why do they continue to go after tooth and nail the person that does no harm it's wrong it's wrong and we're sick and tired of being vilified we really are as a shooting community and it's not just our club it's not just Toronto revolver it's the whole firearms community of which there are millions in this country we are sick and tired of being the scapegoat for these P people who cannot and will not follow the the Troodon tried-and-true methods within the Criminal Code we are sick and tired of being the scapegoat for as I said good meaning politicians who just cannot see the writing on the wall and one last question Meredith given that you are a gun expert given that you spent many a gun fan a gun efficient out of it but but given that you know about guns and you fire guns given that you were a police officer who for several years patrolled the mean streets of Toronto if you had the ear of the mayor what would you tell him in terms of giving him advice to address illegal gun crime I would tell him the very same thing that I would tell anybody whether it be the mayor the prime minister the premier if ice the standalone politician enforce the law don't make it you know ridiculous rules that are going to do nothing for our society enforce the law the Harper government in increased penalties for illegal gun ownership and the use of a firearm as soon as the present government got in there they got rid of it it wasn't very kind so what happens is as they go on they take away the penalty that was supposed to be the deterrent never got to be used everything is for the criminal the victim is way way way down the list so you know no they it's it's time to enforce the law we have good laws in this country dan we have good laws I mean look at what we have to go through just to participate in our given sport we have good laws in this country enforce those laws to the letter and don't give people a break that break the laws you know don't don't back away from that and that's the problem there's far too much of this oh we can't offend any buddy I'm sorry the day of can't offend anybody where lives are at stake is way way way overdue it's gone they sure don't seem to mind offending legal gun owners though no they don't mind at all they don't and they'll try every trick in the book to do it thank you so much for your time Meredith appreciate it thank you you
