>> Martha: UPDATE ON OUR GUEST
TONIGHT ALICE JOHNSON AND HER
ATTORNEY AREN'T GETTING SET UP
THEY WILL JOIN US IN JUST A
MOMENT.
IN THE MEANTIME ALSO BREAKING
TONIGHT DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS?
JUNE 14TH A WEEK FROM TODAY WE
WILL FINALLY GET A LOOK AT THE
HIGHLY ANTICIPATED
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT ON
THE FBI AND THE DOJ HANDLING OF
THE WHOLE CLINTON EMAIL
INVESTIGATION WHICH REPORTEDLY
WILL SAY THAT JAMES COMEY DEFIED
AUTHORITY.
IT'S A 400 PAGES LONG AND IT'S
ABOUT TO BE RELEASED, THOSE
FINDINGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO A
LOT OF PEOPLE AND THEY ARE
IMPORTANT TO THIS FORMER NAVY
SAILOR WHO WAS RECENTLY PARDONED
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP.
HE SAYS HE WAS SENT TO JAIL FOR
A VERY SIMILAR ISSUE THAT
HILLARY CLINTON WAS LOOKED AT
FOUR.
HE TOOK PICTURES ON HIS
SUBMARINE BUT HE SAID THAT
HILLARY CLINTON DID MUCH WORSE
WITH NO CONSEQUENCES AND NOW
HE'S THREATENING TO SUE THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAYING THAT
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND JAMES COMEY
NEED TO ANSWER FOR THEIR
ACTIONS.
HE'S HERE EXCLUSIVELY WITH US,
FIRST TRACE GALLAGHER WITH THE
BACK STORY ON THIS ONE.
>> THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES HE WAS
SUBJECT UNDER EQUAL REDUCTION OF
THE LAW.
HE TOOK PHOTOS OF THE
SUBMARINE'S PROPULSION SYSTEMS
WHICH HE KNEW WAS CLASSIFIED.
HE TOOK THEM TO SHOW HIS FAMILY
AND TO DENY SHARING THEM WITH
ANY UNAUTHORIZED SOURCE.
HE LATER DESTROYED HIS LAPTOP,
CAMERA, AND THE MEMORY CARD THAT
STORED THE PHOTOS.
HIS LAWYER POINTS OUT THAT HIS
CLIENT TOOK SIX PICTURES OF
AREAS THAT WERE CONFIDENTIAL OR
RESTRICTED.
HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE EMAIL
ACCOUNT CONTAINED 110 EMAILS AND
52 EMAIL CHAINS CONSIDERED
CLASSIFIED THAT WERE TOP-SECRET
END OF 36 THAT WERE CLASSIFIED
AS SECRET.
HILLARY CLINTON MAINTAINS SHE
DIDN'T KNOW THE INFORMATION WAS
CLASSIFIED THOUGH JAMES COMEY
SAYS SHE CLEARLY SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN.
THE TREATMENT GIVEN TO KRISTIAN
SAUCIER VERSUS HILLARY CLINTON
ALSO BECAME A MAJOR THEME DURING
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, WATCH.
>> ABOUT THE YOUNG MEN WHO TOOK
PICTURES OF HIS SUBMARINE, HE
WANTED TO HAVE SOME PICTURES.
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A BRAND-NEW
SUBMARINE IT'S MANY YEARS OLD.
THEY PUT HIM IN JAIL FOR A YEAR
AND THAT SHE DOES ALL OF THESE
DIFFERENT THINGS.
>> IT WASN'T JUST THE CLINTON
COMPARISON DRIVING THE NARRATIVE
COMPARISON DRIVING THE NARRATIV
NARRATIVE.
ONE WAS GIVEN A REDUCTION IN
RANK, THE OTHER WAS DOCKED $560
IN PAY.
SAUCIER'S LAWYER SAYS THESE
TYPES OF CASES ARE ALMOST ALWAYS
HANDED WITHIN THE MILITARY,
INSTEAD KRISTIAN SAUCIER WAS
DISCHARGED FROM THE NAVY, AND
WAS A CONVICTED FELON UNTIL
PRESIDENT TRUMP PARDONED HIM
LAST MONTH.
HERE HE IS RIGHT AFTER THE
PRESIDENT CLEARED HIS CRIMINAL
RECORD, WATCH.
>> I STILL HAVE FAITH IN THE
SYSTEM AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE
REASON WHY A MAINTAINED -- I
SERVED MY TIME I DIDN'T CAUSE
ANY ISSUES IN PRISON I DID MY
TIME THE RIGHT WAY.
I TOOK MY PUNISHMENT LIKE A MAN
AND I GOT OUT AND I DID MY BEST
TO BE A CONTRIBUTING MEMBER OF
SOCIETY.
>> HE IS VERY GRATEFUL THE
PRESIDENT TOOK ACTION, HE KNOWS
IT'S NOT A MAGIC WAND BUT HE IS
STAYING POSITIVE AND LOOKING
FORWARD.
>> Martha: JOINED AT ME NOW
FOR AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW,
FORMER NAVY SEAL KRISTIAN
SAUCIER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU HAD THIS STRANGE PARALLEL
EXPERIENCE OF WATCHING WITH
HILLARY CLINTON WAS GOING
THROUGH AND WHAT THEY WERE
FINDING DAY AFTER DAY, WEEK
AFTER WEEK AND CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION THAT WAS ON HER
SERVER THAT SHE TRIED TO DESTROY
SERVER THAT SHE TRIED TO DESTRO
DESTROY.
THEN YOU HEAR THIS FROM JAMES
COMEY WHEN HE CAME OUT ON
JULY 5TH 2016.
>> ALL THE CASES PROSECUTED TO
INVOLVE SOME COMBINATION OF
CLEARLY INTENTIONAL AND WILLFUL
MISHANDLING OF CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION OR VAST QUANTITIES
OF INFORMATION, EXPOSED IN SUCH
A WAY AS TO BE AN INFERENCE OF
MISCONDUCT OR INDICATIONS OF
DISLOYALTY TO THE UNITED STATES
OR EFFORTS TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE.
WE DO NOT SEE THOSE THINGS HERE.
>> Martha: WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU
LISTEN TO ALL OF THAT, THE SAME
FBI THAT WAS INVESTIGATING YOU?
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.
THE FUNNY PART IS, RIGHT AFTER
THAT HE SAID IF ANYBODY ELSE
DOES THIS THEY WILL BE IN
PRISON.
IT'S OKAY IF HILLARY CLINTON
DOES IT BUT ANYBODY ELSE YOU
CAN'T.
THAT'S THE MAJOR POINT OF MY
CASE.
I'M FIGHTING FOR EQUAL JUSTICE
FOR EVERYBODY, I'VE ALREADY
SERVED MY YEAR IN PRISON,
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS GIVEN MY
LIFE BACK.
THIS IS ME FIGHTING FOR THE
AVERAGE AMERICAN CITIZEN, YOU
SHOULDN'T BE SUBJECTED TO A
SEPARATE SET OF LAWS TO
HILLARY CLINTON OR JAMES COMEY
WHO ADMITTED TO LEAKING
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO THE
PRESS TO BENEFIT HIMSELF OR SAME
THING WITH ANDREW McCABE.
THESE PEOPLE AREN'T ABOVE THE
LAW BUT APPARENTLY THEY ARE.
I'M GOING TO FIGHT BACK AS LONG
AS THERE IS A BREATH IN MAY.
I WILL DROP THE LAWSUIT TOMORROW
IF THEY RESTORE MY FAITH IN THE
THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
>> Martha: YOU EXPECT THAT, IF
YOU BREAK THE LAW WHICH YOU
FESSED UP TO AND YOU DESTROYED
THE EVIDENCE I WOULD IMAGINE
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU GOT SCARED,
RIGHT?
YOU THROUGH THE LAPTOP AWAY, YOU
WENT THROUGH THAT PROCESS.
EVERYONE EXPECTS THE SAME RULES
APPLY FOR EVERYBODY.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS IG
REPORT ON JUNE 14TH, WHAT IS THE
POTENTIAL FOR USING WHAT YOU SEE
IN THEIR TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR
CASE?
WHAT DOES YOUR LAWYER SAY ABOUT
THAT?
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A
BOMBSHELL.
IT'S GOING TO SHOW HOW JAMES
COMEY DECIDED WHO BROKE THE LAW
AND WHO DIDN'T.
HE INTERPRETED THE LAW IN A
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY FOR
HILLARY CLINTON THAN HE DID ME.
AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD WAKE UP
EVERY MORNING WITH FAITH THE
JUSTICE SYSTEM IS GOING TO
PROTECT THEM, THAT'S WHAT IT'S
THERE FOR.
THE TRUE ENEMY OF THE STATE
ISN'T THE SERVICEMEN TAKING
PICTURES OF SOMETHING HE'S PROUD
OF, IT'S THE PEOPLE CHANGING THE
LAWS TO BENEFIT THEIR CRONIES.
THAT IS WHAT IS BREAKING DOWN, I
HOPE THAT'S WHAT THE LAWSUIT
WILL DO.
I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR THIS AS
LONG AS I HAVE A BREATH IN ME.
WHEN I WAS IN THE MILITARY I
THOUGHT ENEMIES FOREIGN AND NOW
I FIGHT ENEMIES DOMESTIC.
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE COMEY IS,
HE'S A DOMESTIC ENEMY.
>> Martha: I KNOW YOU SAY
YOU'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE PARDON
AND YOU'RE STARTING TO GET YOUR
LIFE BACK, WERE HAPPY FOR YOU IF
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENING IN YOUR
OWN LIFE, KEEP US POSTED WITH
