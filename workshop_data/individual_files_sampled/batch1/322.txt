Kenyon's are making their voice hard loud and clear they're protesting against corruption triggered by a scandal involving a government agency 90 million dollars is missing from the National Youth Service which was set up to help the young unemployed by providing training thousands of people including senior officials at the agency are being investigated some have been charged allegations include payments for dubious supplies inflated costs and payouts for services that were never delivered in the first place a manual Barraza give up his business day to join the protests rave has become very difficult I carry passages on my motorcycle I worked so hard for so Litro he had all we hear is corruption involving billions president Uhuru Kenyatta has said all the man who will be recovered and that those found guilty will be held to account but many on this much say that previous such scandals have never been properly dealt with there aren't many protesters yeah but their frustration is felt by most Kenyans who want the government to do more and its fight against corruption they say that more people should be going to prison there are assets frozen and that all the stolen money should be returned it's not the first time the National Youth Service has been at the center of a corruption case in 2015 almost 8 million dollars was stolen in a similar way there were about 24 people who are taken to court and only one was found to have a case for himself so 23 of them walked away scot-free if you look at their positioning even within the hierarchy of the ministry the parent ministry and NYS itself so the fairly junior it's unlikely that you can pull off such as control unknown these protesters say they're tired of having their money stolen they marched to the high courts with the police keeping the distance for a few tense minutes they blocked a convoy carrying the Chief Justice calling for quick trials they finally ended up at the gates of parliament this is just one of many anti-corruption rallies that have been held in recent years those taking Pat's hope those in power will finally start listening Catherine saw a al Jazeera Nairobi Kenya
