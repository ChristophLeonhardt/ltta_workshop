EARLY THIS MORNING A MASSIVE FIRE TORE THROUGH THE GRAND FELT BUILDING IN WEST LONDON. UP TO POSSIBLY 600 PEOPLE WERE BELIEVED TO BE IN THE APARTMENT BUILDING, MANY OF THEM TRAPPED AS THE FIRE CONTINUED. IT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BROKEN OUT ON ONE OF THE BOTTOM FLOORS. IT IS HORRIFYING. YES, LONDON Ã± THIS HAS BEEN THERE DAY DEALING WITH THIS FIRE. TRAGICALLY MANY DID DIE ALREADY. AS THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON, PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHAT CAUSED THIS? HOW DID IT SPREAD SO QUICKLY? THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CLOUDING ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING. SOME PEOPLE SAY IT WAS MAINLY REPLACED TO MAKE THE BUILDING LOOK COSMETICALLY MORE ATTRACTIVE BUT THEORETICALLY IT COULD'VE MADE IT MORE VULNERABLE TO FIRE. WE DO NOT KNOW IF THAT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH HOW THE FIRE SPREAD. IF IT IS FOUND THAT FAULTY WIRING WAS THE CAUSE, I THINK IT'S JUST ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES THAT THERE ARE SOME REGULATIONS THAT MATTER. IF YOU PUT THIS IN THE US CONTEXT, IF YOU EVER WANT TO DO ANY TYPE OF REFURBISHMENT OR REMODELING IN YOUR HOME YOU HAVE TO GO GET PERMITS. IT IS SUPER ANNOYING. WHY WOULD THIS BE ON YOUR MIND NOW? PERMITS ARE THERE FOR A REASON, TO ENSURE THE WORK IS DONE BY A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ELECTRICITY AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A DISASTROUS FIRE. REGULATIONS LIKE THAT MAKE SENSE. IT BREAKS MY HEART TO KNOW THAT IF THE FAULTY WIRING IS WHAT CAUSED THIS, IT BREAKS MY HEART THAT THESE PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE BUILDING TO ACTUALLY DO THE RIGHT THING. IT SAYS THAT THERE WAS COMPLAINTS FOR YEARS. IT'S CRAZY TO LOOK AT THE LAST CENTURY AND SEE HOW MUCH HORRIFIC DEADLY FIRES DEFINED THE CENTURY. WE DON'T SEE THESE THINGS HAPPEN ANYMORE. IT'S DEVASTATING AND IT WAS PREVENTABLE. THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND CRIMINALLY CHARGED SO WE CAN SET AN EXAMPLE. YOU CANNOT CUT COSTS BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL DIE. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DEREGULATE AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO RUN THEIR BUSINESSES OR THEIR COMPANIES TO SEE FIT. ONE OF THE WAYS OF CUTTING COSTS IS MAY BE HIRING PEOPLE BUT DON'T DO THE JOB PROPERLY. HOPEFULLY THAT IS THE LESSON THAT IS LEARNED FROM THE START BUT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE.
