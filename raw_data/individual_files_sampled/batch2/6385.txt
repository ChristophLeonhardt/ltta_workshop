now you know in charlottesville they had the situation where a neo-nazi ran over 20 people actually ran over a lot of people injured 19 and killed Heather hire and everybody was outright outraged by it with the possible and notable exception of Donald Trump but a lot of Republicans did the right thing they said the right words and an unlike Trump they came out and called out the fascist for what they were but if you didn't know there have been Republicans - all across the country who've actually proposed legislation to make it legal to run over people if they're protesting now they say that it's unintentional but with a serious wing thrown in there so let me give you a couple of examples the intercept wrote about this at Jelani and lee fong in texas for example state representative Pat Fallon introduced a bill to limit the liability of motorists responsible for hitting individuals who are quote blocking traffic in a public right away while participating in a protest or demonstration the combined law enforcement Association of Texas that's cleat a statewide coalition of municipal and county police associations lists fouls bill among legislation supported by cleat by the way cleat as in we step on you and leave our cleat marks so that's really subtle anyway when representative Pat Fallon in Texas was asked about this Jesus man this bill would make it legal to run over protesters he still stands by the bill and says oh no no no this is if you unintentionally run over protesters wink but don't worry you still won't be held liable they're not alone North Carolina's version of the immunity bill HB 330 passed the lower chamber of the legislature in April the text of this bill says that a person driving an automobile who's exercising do Karen injures another person who's participating in a protest or demonstration is blocking traffic in a public right away is immune from civil liability for the injury by the way the in charlottesville the people who were protesting had a the counter protesters of the nazis had every right to be there they had permits but they were on a place where you could I've a car that's why the the Nazi guy drove the car and hit them so according to these bills because well I mean it was kind of a road it was an alleyway was a road and I mean I don't know maybe he was trying to this is the Nazi excuse by the way they literally said this maybe he was trying to get away from those scary violent counter protesters like Donald Trump said he said the counter protesters were violent and so hey if he you know ran into them the way that he did if this bill passed in the lower chamber of North Carolina's legislature was to be in effect they'd say not guilty you had a white look think about this right if all they cared about was making sure that people are safe on highways why wouldn't they say hey if you go on a highway and someone runs into you it's partially your fault now I wouldn't agree with that either don't run over anybody take all care not just a little bit of care but they didn't say that they specifically pointed out protesters if you see protesters on a road we're gonna hold you we're gonna give you immunity so you're not held liable for running them over these bills are monstrous here's Florida in Florida State Senator George Gaynor sponsored SB 1090 six that build that limits liability for motorists responsible for the unintentional injury or death of protesters obstructing traffic the Florida State Fraternal Order of Police an association that represents 22,000 law enforcement personnel in the state held a press conference to support the gainer bill and you know all of these instances the people who proposed these bills have not backed away from them and look those are cops and 22,000 of them and it's not enough a few bad apples saying you see protesters on the road why not just run them over so hey we want to call the people of Charlottesville fascists who killed Heather hire well that's literal and there's no question about that but what do you call the people who want to make that legal there's an argument to be made that you may you call them something worse now these bills did not pass and by the way if you were wondering hey Jake you said their wings are you sure about that now lusco different instance here to give you a sense of the mindset in Massachusetts on a police officer cheered on hires death over the weekend posting on Facebook hahahaha love this may be people shouldn't block roadways and at North Dakota also considers in fact similar bills have been proposed in Rhode Island North Carolina Tennessee and North Dakota in North Dakota it's because there was protesters who were saying hey don't do drilling here it's likely to pollute the river that it's going under in fact there's leaks all the time there's been leaks since then and if he gets into the waterways it could poison us all North Dakota Republicans were like oh great if they're trying to protect the waterways make sure you run them over oh I'm sorry I'll give you immunity if you happen to run them over on the road if we see with our own eyes is so uncomfortable we're gonna have to call it fascist but if we pass it as a law that hey it's legal to be a fascist these are grotesque luckily none of these have passed so far but the Republicans and they are all Republicans who proposed these bills are unrepentant and want to keep on going and actually get them into law at some point TYT membership gets your commercial-free young turks downloaded
