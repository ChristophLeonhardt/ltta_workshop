*America the Beautiful plays*
Be careful out there, America.
Americans love to blow things up on July 4th.
The tradition goes all the way
back to the Declaration of Independence.
It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with... Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations
from one End of this Continent to the other
from this time forward forever more.
â€” John Adams
In a letter to his wife Abigail, July, 3, 1776
So we do just that.
And then people get hurt.
Fireworks were implicated
in 11,100 hospital vistis in 2016.
An estimated 7,600 took place
between June 18th and July 18th.
