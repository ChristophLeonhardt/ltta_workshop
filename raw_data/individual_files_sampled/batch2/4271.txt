new heat on Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen he's now preparing to change up his legal team and reportedly struggling with their fees now today I just spoke with Cohen's predecessor as Trump's top lawyer a man you may have seen named Jay Goldberg now in a moment I'm going to speak with Nick Ackerman about what we're hearing but here's the context I have big questions for Jay and here's what he told me about the new legal pressure facing Cohen now today do you think Michael Cohen is more likely to flip than before more likely to flip because he's now facing the prospect of lawyers pressuring him predict you legal fees a lot of speculation out there but that's the voice of Jay Goldberg who says he still has attorney-client privilege with Trump and who was there before Cohen and he thinks Cohen is now more likely to cooperate with the feds so then I asked Goldberg about the nature of the pressures facing Cohen Nick take a listen to this as well so we can discuss do you think that Michael Cohen is under pressure for things he did for himself or for things he did for Donald Trump has been made clear enough and I hope you understand it every builder in New York City is the subject mob influenced by unions the mob from pella builder unless you give me a portion of money you will have labor strikes and this will or there will be garbage and not picked up on time now you have to ask yourself and nobody has mentioned why is the US attorney in the Southern District investigating Michael cone why is it Russia no is it labor racketeering yes do you think the feds may have evidence that Michael Cohen fix things as you say for Trump for the mob I think that Michael Kohn we killed people with the fact that he was connected come up employees as I mentioned the Cattleman's here along with former federal prosecutor John Flannery Nick I J Goldberg would know I first met J Goldberg when he represented funds et re when I was prosecuting him as the boss of the Genovese family J Goldberg represented Thierry and he represented other members of that family if anybody knows about the mob it has an inside story on that it's Jay Goldberg so what he talks about the Cohens regaling his word people with stories of fixing Donald Trump's mob problems you're saying he's nothing about the mob in theory or an imagination he has his own knowledge oh he knows because he was representing I mean I'll give you one example with this tre case I had four witnesses in the witness protection program all of whom Jay Goldberg was cross-examining he knows what it means for a witness to flip he knows what it means when somebody cooperates and he also understands that somebody like Cohen can cooperate because all of those records that have been seized from his office provide a blueprint for whatever crimes he's committed if he was in Prague dealing with the Russians there's going to be evidence in the record John mob ties go ahead well you know Trump is this long association before Roy Cohn passed to his final reward and the association with the mob and the variety of ways the building industry the failed casinos you have to wonder about those how a casino fails and so I felt like he was pulling a rudy in a way because he's introducing an aspect that Cohen is dealing with the mob for Trump which is kind of an astonishing thing and I haven't seen anything publicly saying that that's what the investigation is about but this is coming from an individual who represented Donald Trump for a long time I mean part of what we try to do here in reporting this out is talk to the people who are close to it isn't that pretty striking coming tonight Wow striking I think he may open up a whole other investigation I mean Rudy gave us how we funneled money to pay off tricks for mr. Trump and now we're talking about how the fixer also maybe takes care of the mob you know I Trump has been compared to the kind of a godfather person who expects omerta in one direction of loyalty toward him and this would be perfect because he's had people in his tower who are associated with the mob and there's been talk about what he's done in various projects before be pretty scary to have a made fella or an associate of the organized crime Network sitting in the White House determining our foreign policy and our law enforcement policy well and then look this is surfacing from Jay Goldberg he as Nick mentioned has a long a practice history in New York he has his reasons well he's been on the show before but that we considered this newsworthy tonight Nick I also asked him about the allegations of witness tampering with regard to Paul man afforda one thing I'll mention for context for viewers is Goldberg appears intent on showcasing what he views as problematic behavior by Cohen and mana for context for that being there are people around Trump who want to just say yeah maybe these are the worst guys ever but they're rogue bad guys here he was saying that if Muller can prove it witness tampering is a huge deal ream anaphor take a look is Paul Manafort in danger of being jailed before trial great consequence Moloch could make it showing that while he's at Liberty he presents the risk of intimidating or influencing witnesses to testify the way in particular the truth he'd be very well finding self remanded I totally agree with Jay I mean he's absolutely right this is a 20-year felony it's extremely serious and already I mean the only standard now for the judge tomorrow in terms of whether he/she remands him or not is whether or not the government has probable cause that man afford was tampering with witnesses the grand jury's already spoke more lowboy right that's a low bar the grand jury there's so much disagreement these days but Jay Goldberg Trump lawyer and Nick Ackerman a prosecutor who I think it's fair to say is critical of Donald Trump it's fair to say agree tonight that tomorrow might be the first step to Manta for going to jail the other thing I want to play John you mentioned Rudy take a listen to a somewhat lengthy about a 50-second exchange we had on Rudy take a look okay anyways the proper lawyer for him because I think it's such as to draw attention away from Trump in that respect he come out correctly in deciding not to submit from to interrogation do you think Giuliani is effective because even if his public performance is sloppy it's still distracting from the actual Muller probe more by his delivery and which could be awful John briefly well briefly I think Rudy should be arrested for impersonating a criminal defense lawyer personally but I I don't think distracting is your objective Aristotle said nothing improves your aim like having a target Rudy seems to be an army of pompous phrases wandering across a vast landscape looking for an idea did Aristotle say that no a presidential candidate said the last part but Aristotle said the first part about a target well it's very I like to keep up with all the references and rhymes that come up on the show so hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
