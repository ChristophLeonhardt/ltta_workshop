1
00:00:01,372 --> 00:00:03,539
RELATION TO JESSE.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,107
GUYS?

3
00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:05,608
STEVE: THANK YOU, BRIAN.

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:06,909
IN THE PAST FEW YEARS

5
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,111
POLITICAL ATTACKS HAVE

6
00:00:08,112 --> 00:00:09,912
GOTTEN VERY LOW THE LATEST

7
00:00:09,913 --> 00:00:11,280
TACTIC FROM THE LEFT RELEASE

8
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:12,482
OF PRIVATE INFORMATION LIKE

9
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:14,250
PHONE NUMBER, ADDRESS

10
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,051
RELEASED ON THE WEB.

11
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:17,520
THAT IS KNOWN AS DOXXING.

12
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:18,454
AINSLEY: THIS WAS DONE TO

13
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:20,590
SEVERAL SENATORS AND CORY

14
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:21,858
GARDNER'S WIFE EVEN RECEIVED

15
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:23,993
A VIDEO ON CELL PHONE

16
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:24,961
CONTAINING GRAPHIC FOOTAGE

17
00:00:24,962 --> 00:00:26,429
OF A MAN BEING BEHEADED.

18
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,997
HOW FAR WILL THESE POLITICAL

19
00:00:27,998 --> 00:00:28,664
ATTACKS GO?

20
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:32,301
JOINING US NOW IS THE HOLSEY

21
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:33,469
OF FOX NATION TOMI LAHREN.

22
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,904
SHE HAS SEEN THESE ATTACKS

23
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:36,239
FIRST HAND AND THEY ARE

24
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,173
UGLY, AREN'T THEY, TOMI?

25
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:38,808
>> THEY ARE UGLY AND GETTING

26
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:39,108
WORSE.

27
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:41,044
I HAVE TO SAY FOR THE RECORD

28
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:42,712
I HAVE BEEN DOCKED.

29
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:45,048
I HAVE HAD THINGS SENT TO MY

30
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:46,716
HOME BOTH IN TEXAS AND

31
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:47,116
CALIFORNIA.

32
00:00:47,117 --> 00:00:48,818
I HAVE HAD PEOPLE CONFRONT

33
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:49,719
ME IN PUBLIC.

34
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,422
THIS IS NOT JUST SOMETHING

35
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:53,723
SENATORS GOING THROUGH IT'S

36
00:00:53,724 --> 00:00:55,625
ANYONE WHO SITS RIGHT OF

37
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:56,559
CENTER, ANYONE WHO IS A

38
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,326
TRUMP SUPPORTER.

39
00:00:57,327 --> 00:00:58,795
WE ARE ALL TARGETS OF THIS

40
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:00,029
AND EXTENDS BEYOND THIS

41
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,830
WHOLE PUBLIC OFFICE.

42
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:02,265
THE AVERAGE CITIZEN, IF YOU

43
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:04,000
ARE ON THE RIGHT SHOULD BE

44
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:06,869
CONCERNED AND IN DANGER.

45
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,637
AINSLEY: IT'S INCITING

46
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:08,004
VIOLENCE.

47
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:09,705
WHAT IF IT GETS OUT OF HAND?

48
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:11,007
SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET

49
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:11,441
HURT.

50
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:15,845
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE

51
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:19,715
DANGERS.

52
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:20,917
>> I HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT

53
00:01:20,918 --> 00:01:22,785
THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE.

54
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:23,686
I AM WORRIED ABOUT YOUNG

55
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:25,455
PEOPLE ON CAMPUSES.

56
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:26,355
IT'S UNREST.

57
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:27,757
NOT JUST PROTESTING AND

58
00:01:27,758 --> 00:01:28,124
SIGNS.

59
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,293
IT'S BECOMING PHYSICAL AS

60
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:31,094
LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN

61
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:31,461
PORTLAND.

62
00:01:31,462 --> 00:01:32,995
GETTING WORSE FOR YOUNG

63
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:33,329
PEOPLE.

64
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,630
FOR AVERAGE CITIZENS AND MY

65
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:35,665
FEAR IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET

66
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,700
WORSE AS WE GET CLOSER TO

67
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:38,968
MIDTERMS AS REPUBLICANS KEEP

68
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:39,302
WINNING.

69
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:41,370
WE HAVE GREAT VICTORIES.

70
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:42,872
AS MUCH AS WE ARE EXCITED

71
00:01:42,873 --> 00:01:44,040
ABOUT OUR VICTORIES.

72
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,741
THE LEFT IS MORE UPSET THAN

73
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:47,877
EVER ABOUT THEIR LOSSES AND

74
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:49,011
TAKE IT OUT ON US EVERY

75
00:01:49,012 --> 00:01:50,880
CHANCE THEY GET.

76
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:51,848
STEVE: THERE WAS ANOTHER

77
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:53,683
CLASH IN PORTLAND.

78
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:54,684
ANTIFA WERE PROTEST AGO

79
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:55,685
POLICE SHOOTING THERE.

80
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:57,386
AND ONCE AGAIN, YOU KNOW,

81
00:01:57,387 --> 00:01:58,488
YOU ARE WONDERING WHY AREN'T

82
00:01:58,489 --> 00:01:59,388
THE POLICE SHUTTING THESE

83
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:02,191
THINGS DOWN?

84
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:04,861
WHEN VIOLENCE ENSUES.

85
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:06,395
>> WELL, OF COURSE.

86
00:02:06,396 --> 00:02:07,997
AND BEYOND THAT WHEN WE ARE

87
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:08,898
TALKING ABOUT ANTIFA, I HAVE

88
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,533
SAID THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE,

89
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,101
WHEN I LOOK AT THESE MEMBERS

90
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:13,336
OF ANTIFA, I WOULD CERTAINLY

91
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:14,137
HOPE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

92
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:15,605
WOULD STAND UP AND SAY THESE

93
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:17,073
ARE NOT TRULY DEMOCRATS.

94
00:02:17,074 --> 00:02:18,307
I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY ARE

95
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:19,242
TRULY DEMOCRATS.

96
00:02:19,243 --> 00:02:20,343
WHAT I REALLY THINK OF

97
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:21,844
ANTIFA IS THESE ARE ADULT

98
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:23,079
CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN THEIR

99
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,147
MOTHER'S BASEMENT WHO ARE

100
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:26,649
UPSET AND ANGRY AND WANTS AN

101
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,618
EXCUSE TO GO OUT IN THE

102
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:30,319
STREETS AND WREAK HAVOC ON

103
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,820
THE CITIZENS.

104
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:33,256
YOU ARE SEEING IT HAPPEN NOW

105
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:35,057
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND

106
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:36,492
SPECIFICALLY IN PORTLAND

107
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:37,160
TERRIFYING WHAT THEY ARE

108
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,361
DOING TO AVERAGE CITIZENS ON

109
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:39,028
THE STREET.

110
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:40,463
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE

111
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:41,931
TRUMP SUPPORTERS.

112
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:42,999
JUST AVERAGE CITIZENS AND

113
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,600
BEING ATTACKED IN THEIR OWN

114
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:44,934
TOWNS.

115
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:46,969
IT'S ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS.

116
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,670
STEVE: ONE OF THOSE CARS

117
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:50,740
THAT WE SAW SOMEBODY DID

118
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:51,908
$8,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE TO IT

119
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,045
THEY DON'T KNOW WHO DID IT.

120
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:56,979
>> I FIND THAT HARD TO

121
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,047
BELIEVE THEY DON'T KNOW WHO

122
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:59,916
DID T AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS

123
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:00,216
CHAOS.

124
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:01,150
NOT SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE

125
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:02,285
SEEING IN OUR STREETS IN THE

126
00:03:02,286 --> 00:03:03,386
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

127
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:04,654
THIS IS COMPLETELY AND

128
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:05,621
TOTALLY UNHINGED.

129
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:07,823
SO AS I SAID BEFORE, I HOPE

130
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:10,293
THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

131
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:11,994
PARTY AND LEFT COMES OUT AND

132
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:13,196
SAYS THESE MEMBERS OF ANTIFA

133
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:14,163
DON'T REPRESENT US.

134
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:15,531
BUFF I HAVE YET TO SEE THAT

135
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:17,133
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FOLKS

136
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:18,167
LIKE MAXINE WATERS WHO

137
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:19,235
CALLED FOR THIS KIND OF

138
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:20,970
BEHAVIOR MAYBE IN A LESSER

139
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:21,971
CONTEXT BUT CERTAINLY CALLED

140
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,506
FOR THINGS LIKE THIS AND

141
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:23,906
HARASSMENT.

142
00:03:23,907 --> 00:03:25,041
I HOPE THEY CAN COME OUT AND

143
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:26,275
RECOGNIZE THE KIND OF

144
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:27,109
INFLUENCE THEY ARE HAVING ON

145
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,443
PEOPLE.

146
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:28,844
THIS IS GETTING BEYOND

147
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:29,445
POLITICAL DIFFERENCES.

148
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:31,013
THIS IS ACTUALLY DANGEROUS.

149
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:31,914
AINSLEY: WHEN I SAW THAT

150
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:34,483
VIDEO, I REMEMBER YOU AND

151
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:35,685
YOUR FAMILY AT A RESTAURANT.

152
00:03:35,686 --> 00:03:36,953
THEY THREW ICE ON YOU.

153
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:38,688
THEY THREW A DRINK ON YOU.

154
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,189
SEE THAT VIDEO OF THAT GUY

155
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,190
IN FRONT OF HIS CAR.

156
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:42,925
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET

157
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:43,226
HURT.

158
00:03:43,227 --> 00:03:44,760
WHEN IS THIS GOING TO END OR

159
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:45,528
IS IT GOING TO GET WORSE?

160
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:46,862
>> START WITH PEOPLE BANGING

161
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:48,197
ON CARS OR THROWING WATER AS

162
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:49,765
THEY DID ON ME AND GET

163
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:50,399
PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.

164
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,635
WE SAW OF COURSE IN EUROPE

165
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:53,636
THE ACID THROWING.

166
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:54,971
THAT'S MY BIGGEST FEAR THAT

167
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:56,272
WILL BECOME THE NEW WEAPON

168
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:57,039
AND MORE DANGEROUS.

169
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,541
IT STARTS AS FUN AND GAMES

170
00:03:58,542 --> 00:03:59,842
IN THEIR MINDS IT STARTS AS

171
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:01,677
A JOKE AND SOME MEAN GIRLS

172
00:04:01,678 --> 00:04:02,478
THROWING SOME THINGS.

173
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,913
I THINK IT'S GOING TO TURN

174
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:05,781
MUCH MORE UGLY ESPECIALLY AS

175
00:04:05,782 --> 00:04:08,117
WE HEAD INTO MIDTERMS.

176
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:10,553
AS EXCITED AS WE ARE ABOUT

177
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,989
THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION.

178
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,223
I THINK CONSERVATIVES AND

179
00:04:14,224 --> 00:04:16,058
TRUMP SUPPORTERS NEED TO BE

180
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:17,159
PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE

181
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,662
IT'S GETTING NASTIER THAN

182
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:20,029
EVER.

183
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:20,695
AINSLEY: IS IT WORTH IT FOR

184
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:20,963
YOU.

185
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:21,831
DO YOU THINK ABOUT STOPPING.

186
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:22,932
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

187
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:29,739
BECAUSE IF WE DO THEY WIN.

188
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,906
WE HAVE DEEP OUR VOICES

189
00:04:30,907 --> 00:04:31,974
STRONG AND VILLAGE LENGTH.

190
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:33,009
TAKE THE NECESSARY

191
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,010
PRECAUTIONS THE WORSE THINGS

192
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:35,244
WE COULD DO WOULD BE TO STOP

193
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:38,481
AND BE INTIMIDATED BY PEOPLE

194
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:39,715
LIKE THAT.

195
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:40,182
STEVE: PEACEFUL

196
00:04:40,183 --> 00:04:40,950
PRO-ACCESSES, FINE, IT'S

197
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:42,318
WHEN IT CROSSES THE LINE

198
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,120
THAT'S WHEN IT SCARES ALL OF

199
00:04:44,121 --> 00:00:00,000
US.
