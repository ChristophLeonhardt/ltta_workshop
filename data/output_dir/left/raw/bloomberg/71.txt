1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:03,459
This is the town of Lake Arthur, New Mexico.

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:06,940
Population 433. It’s 3 ½ hours from Albuquerque, New Mexico

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,910
and to call it a sleepy southwestern town would be an understatement.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,290
This is Will Norwood. Until recently, he was Lake Arthur's police chief.

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,900
Lake Arthur was an unusual department -- almost every one of Norwood's officers were volunteers.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,800
84 in all. And one of those volunteers?

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,460
Robert Mercer.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,960
Robert Mercer is the fabulously wealthy computer scientist

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,500
who helped bankroll the election of President Donald Trump.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,050
And for six years, by serving as a volunteer policeman in Lake Arthur, Mercer was getting

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,320
something money alone can't buy: the right to carry a concealed firearm anywhere in America.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,790
Bloomberg’s Zach Mider uncovered this latest chapter of the many incredible-but-true stories

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,800
about Mercer.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,490
I was definitely surprised, but I’m sort
of used to being surprised by

15
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,700
all the interesting things that Robert Mercer is up to.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,950
So who is Robert Mercer?

17
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,549
Here’s what we know about this incredibly
secretive, political kingmaker

18
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,060
and some of the fringe ideas he bankrolls.

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,069
Robert Mercer is notoriously private.

20
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:19,729
Zach: “As far as we know, Mercer has never spoken publicly about his political beliefs.

21
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:24,789
He really is not interested in talking publicly about what he believes or why.”

22
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:29,590
So one of the only ways to get a clearer picture of Mercer, is to follow his web of money.

23
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,270
And a lot of it supports projects far from
the mainstream as you can possibly get.

24
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,820
Zach: “That's a theme that you see with
Mercer again and again, is that he's deeply

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,909
skeptical of the received wisdom and that
connects to a lot of his support for what

26
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,789
you might call kind of fringe science and
fringe economics ideas,

27
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:54,779
and really his willingness to bankroll people like Steve Bannon, who at the time was not

28
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:58,060
considered an A-list political player.”

29
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,060
Steve Bannon led Trump’s campaign in the final months leading to the election and of

30
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,399
course he later moved to the White House.

31
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,030
For years, Mercer was the money behind Bannon’s projects, the biggest one being Breitbart

32
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,030
News.

33
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,800
Zach: “Bannon had this very distinct vision for a new kind of conservative politics that

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,990
would be much more populist than the standard republican playbook.”

35
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,730
In 2011, Mercer gave the far-right, populist website $10 million. Soon after, Bannon became

36
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,120
Breitbart’s executive chairman and the site’s audience exploded.

37
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,580
Zach: “Bannon really builds this thing into
a juggernaut of conservative politics.”

38
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,770
Mercer also helped fund a Bannon-led nonprofit organization, which published a book portraying

39
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,300
Hillary Clinton as corrupt.

40
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,640
“It does involve the Clintons and an enormous mining company called Uranium One.”

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,560
“This company, Uranium One, which controlled about a fifth of America’s uranium…”

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,420
“Giving away nuclear capability to our enemies…”

43
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,010
All of that came from the book “Clinton
Cash”.

44
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,851
The third BIG Bannon project that Mercer bankrolled was Cambridge Analytica. Bannon and Mercer

45
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:11,020
co-founded the political data firm in 2013,
with Mercer giving $15 million. Later the

46
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,320
Trump campaign hired the firm to help get
Trump elected.

47
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,370
This is the Cambridge Analytica that in 2018
became the center of a tech and political

48
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:24,020
firestorm for using the personal data of 87 million Facebook users without their approval.

49
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,820
And those are just some of the political projects
that Mercer has funded.

50
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,120
As a family, the Mercer’s have given more
than $40 million to GOP candidates

51
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,060
and super PACs since 2010.

52
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,990
Outside of politics, some of the more quirky ideas that Mercer has funded include

53
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:45,480
a scientist in Oregon who has a gigantic stockpile of human urine with the goal of extending human life.

54
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,540
A counter-conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, promoting the use of the gold standard.

55
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,300
And he gives millions to multiple groups attacking the science of global warming.

56
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,569
Now 71, Mercer wasn’t always rich and able to bankroll his idiosyncratic views.

57
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:03,400
He grew up in New Mexico with an interest in computers.

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,520
Zach: “Through his mid- to late-40s he was kind of like a research...almost like a professor.

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,459
He worked at IBM, and he was a researcher. He was responsible for doing really interesting,

60
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,519
cutting-edge work in computer science, but he wasn't a zillionaire.”

61
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,518
At IBM he was part of a team laying the groundwork for modern-day speech-recognition software,

62
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,519
like Google Translate.

63
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:26,819
It wasn’t until his late 40s when he left
IBM for Renaissance Technologies

64
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:30,319
Zach: “...arguably the most successful hedge fund in the history of the world.”

65
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:36,020
Mercer became co-CEO of the fund in 2009, making him a very wealthy man.

66
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,800
The Bloomberg Billionaires Index values his wealth at almost a billion dollars.

67
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,960
Zach: “It seemed to me like a story about
the lengths that a person of really astonishing

68
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:57,219
means will go to to get something that they
otherwise couldn't get.”

69
00:04:57,219 --> 00:05:00,529
The right to carry his gun anywhere in the
U.S.

70
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:04,080
Mercer is a serious gun enthusiast. To give you a picture…

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,050
He co-owns a gun company, bought the largest private collection of these machine guns..

72
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,710
….and has a factory in South Carolina that
makes assault-style rifles.

73
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,819
We also know…

74
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,550
Zach: “When he built his house, which is
this sort of sprawling palace on the north

75
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,919
shore of Long Island, he actually included
in it a pistol range right in the basement

76
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:25,919
of his home.”

77
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,779
But getting a conceal carry permit where Mercer lives is incredibly difficult. And even if

78
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,500
he did get a permit, he would not be able
to take his gun to New York City or other states.

79
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,800
Until 2004, when Congress passed a law which says police officers can carry concealed guns in any state.

80
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,280
Since then, small police departments around the country, including the one in Lake Arthur,

81
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,460
have been rumored to hand out badges in exchange for cash, the so-called “badge factories".

82
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,279
After Businessweek spotlighted the Lake Arthur department, the mayor quickly shut it down.

83
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,839
We still don't know exactly what was going on in Lake Arthur.

84
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,020
What we do know is that during the six years he wore his badge, Mercer supported the town generously.

85
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,840
Zach: “I think he's kind of more whimsical
than most people would imagine. I think he

86
00:06:12,840 --> 00:00:00,000
hears an interesting idea, and he says, "This is something worth exploring and let's give it a shot."
