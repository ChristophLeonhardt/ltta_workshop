kind of like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> after you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

use i'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure always test on</font>

19
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,019
animals it's the only thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

20
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,940
make proper exception to when I'm

21
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,460
looking stuff to buy because and i only

22
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,559
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found one of the ginger-haired I</font>

23
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,379
that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> and available to me</font>

24
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,079
without getting online the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one the</font>

25
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,250
other one that is quite widely available

26
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,620
is the superdrug one it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> dries</font>

27
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,210
out my hair quite a lot and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has it</font>

28
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,149
has a different color to this one and

29
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:52,620
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I should buy that one but</font>

30
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,809
i feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the quality isn't the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

31
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,760
and it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really look after my hair</font>

32
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,899
as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> i find my hair is a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

33
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,910
damaged after i use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and so the</font>

34
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am buying this and you know</font>

35
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,840
obviously I live with the preference of

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,280
buying stuff isn't test on animals every

37
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,659
now and then I make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a relative exception</font>

38
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,010
and this is one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font>

39
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a very very good product it's</font>

40
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">L'Oreal fierros mango intense copper and</font>

41
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,750
it's very very nourishing and the color

42
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,490
is quite red actually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel this is a</font>

43
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,049
very red ginger at first but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does</font>

44
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,119
fade more into a curve<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yellow a</font>

45
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,130
ginger which is what I like more looks

46
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,869
more natural than you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one</font>

47
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,659
but I actually like when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in really</font>

48
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,159
was in San Francisco but<font color="#CCCCCC"> when i was in</font>

54
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,770
hair color but I'm too nervous to ask

55
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,079
and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end I did ask her what she's</font>

56
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,579
and she used this and i've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been using</font>

57
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,860

61
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,860
it smelled amazing I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have</font>

62
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,860
much opinion on shower gels because and

63
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,060
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just shower gels and they clean</font>

64
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,009
you like worst you want and but yeah

really wish that it wasn't ridiculous

71
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,580
that I don't throw out this bowl because

72
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,950
it smells

73
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,050
good it smells like gingerbread men and

74
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,730
it and they also have the recipe of how

75
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,900
to make it on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front so might make</font>

76

white and simple kinds of skin cleansing

81
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,530
white nice but not to wear and not

82
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,690
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth the price boots essentials</font>

83
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,360
cleansing wipes so good and so cheap was

84
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,760
like 343 pounds and they stay really wet

85
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,930
for a really long time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they take off</font>

86

tissue<font color="#CCCCCC"> e as well which is very strange</font>

92
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,890

really love those ones I got a deal but

106
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,360
I probably buy them again just because

107
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,150
they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so expensive sorry but they</font>

108
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,350

is cool and I love maple syrup but every

118
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,889
day it was kind of reverse which is why

119
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,329
this took me so long to use because it's

120
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:39,859
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like I can't use every day I</font>
