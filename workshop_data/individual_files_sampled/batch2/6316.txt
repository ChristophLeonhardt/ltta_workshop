extreme makeover Nazi Edition huh so this Saturday in Charlottesville Virginia a bunch of all writers are coming together for what's called unite the right it is a convention of sorts everybody's gonna have a big party but you might be wondering if you're gonna attend it what do you wear well Andrew England the editor and creator of The Daily stormer named after the Nazi Nazi era tabloid dist Wilma or the stormer wrote a couple guidelines for what people should wear here's one and I want reactions after each the worst look ever is a baggy t-shirt wear fitted t-shirts where the sleeve goes to the middle of your bicep it should not hang lower than the base of your member is ostensibly all the guy's is what we kind of took from that I'll give you one more before we get reactions a jeans and he spelled it wrong should also be fitted not tight just fitted in the photo those are actually shorts he had a photo I should I would not wear pants that loose-fitting and that's another thing that grinds my gears don't it besides the Jews don't ever wear shorts serious men in serious situations are not wearing shorts okay so first of all let's just note for the record how obsessed he is with how tight your clothes should be how they should be around the bicep and they should show off your body but not too much be discreet about how you show off your body make sure it cuts off before your member because everybody needs to see your member okay so don't cover it up but remember I don't like the Jews the gays or anyone else okay if you say so more absurd and I'm sure we're gonna get to those details but real quickly but when I first read the headline for this story I thought oh this is actually a pretty smart tactic cuz you know remember back in the day when the KKK looked like clowns with their white robes and everything you know people didn't take them seriously and so they made a concerted effort to change their appearance right to seem more respectable and so I thought maybe that's where he was going with this but no it just seems like you know he has this like weird arbitrary dress code about like the tightness of clothing and and he gets into weight issues later yes a headline to which he's referring is a vice article reporting on this saying neo-nazi to troll army we have to be sexy at the big alt-right rally well that's literally quoting him so well first of all look lo some right-wingers that have committed terror in the past here in America are obsessed with clothing it is that is an ironic part of it you know the Klan came up with the the white robes from a movie and they thought it was cool when they saw a nun Birth of a Nation and they're like oh that's so neat okay and then they did the Ghostbusters outfit and stuff and and so and they and they went out there and they're like oh this is badass like if they saw the wrestling outfits later they were like let's just cover our faces it off the mask that's right and so they've always been good ones now they'd had deadly consequences back in the day and they later realize that they were playing dress-up and it got awkward and then they decided to go into suits much later on but of course at the time they were terrorizing in horrific ways in those outfits okay so now back to this guy who's obsessed with what parts of his your your body that he wants to see at this rally he did say that you need to look these are all quotes appealing sexy hip and dangerous dangerous and maybe these kinds of handsome yeah look so dangerous yeah because the Nazis who were obsessed with looking hip although but they did have dangerous coverage yeah they were quite dangerous here's another quote from this post Americans have an obsession with this baggy stuff and it always looks bad no matter what it looks bad even if everyone else is doing it for a neo-nazi he sure sounds like my Jewish grandmother a lot of irony here I want to chime in on that so I think in the 90s baggy clothing was in style but but things have changed in in clothing quite a bit since then men are wearing skinny jeans like fitted clothing is very much in and has been for several years now so it's it's interesting that he's commenting it on this as if we're like all wearing chinko jeans still yeah it's just funny here's the thing we're talking about what he says fat people should be allowed to join groups oh are you not merciful and be involved in rallies but we need to create a culture where we aren't necessarily shaming people but do look at them and expect them to get it together we should help people get it together I'm working on my biggest diet guide ever which I think will help the overweight and skinny alike even if they're they've minimal time for exercise no this is my favorite I mean of all the sexy hip dangerous things this one takes the cake so he's like now look guys let's be fair let's not shame fat people that's for Jews and blacks and gays and all those other you're a neo-nazi you're worried about shaming people to that kind of neo-nazi 101 so he's like now that I don't want to discriminate against fat people because a lot of us are fat I know but look the reason why he's saying that is because he suspects and look I don't know what all of these guys look like but I think he suspects that they're all like guys who are hanging out in their parents basements like reading know why there's so here is I'm gonna do the last three all in a row I won't tell you how to cut your hair but I do believe men's hair looks better short thanks for your opinion buddy and beards look better well trimmed he's obsessed with men's looks it's so weird it's very important to look good we much we must have Chad nationalism this is what will make guys want to join us Chad I've heard that term before being like you want to be a Chad like a guy named Chad who's like really sexy and cool and gets chicks and intimidates like people who've never had sex anyways he goes literally it's from something like that that is what will make guys want to join us and that will make girls want to be our rupees yes yeah yeah we simply must be cool the importance of that really does need to be drilled into people's heads this is amazing by the way just very quick commentary about women in his post he says we need to keep women on the sidelines not speaking not leading and with no official membership in anything but he wants to attract women and suggests that buying a food shirt and getting ripped will not only score his crew political clout but get them to be groupies yeah so weird yeah yeah so what women love is if you tell them you're not allowed to do anything yeah okay but you have to be my groupie because I'm not wearing baggy pants it's a winning strategy it's a great strategy he does admit at some point in the post that he does have trouble getting girls no really Wow and these are of course the same guys who complain about claim that other people are betas what is theirs think so it's telling me about this it's a it's some it's work I heard Chad it's involuntary celibate insel or something it's people who get R it's a weird little subculture that it once you start googling about it it's this weird thing about people who are involuntarily celibate and it's women who gravitate to other guys like the Chad's out there that are the problem it's super weird when I first read Chad Nationals I'm like right I thought you wanted to be Americans but now you want to go to Chad pretty sure they don't mean the country now we're good but look but every part of this is amusing there's gonna be apparently left-wing protesters are gonna go protest them they expect 500 of these all right guys to show up first of all if you've United the right and it's 500 people Wow saying about don't go protest these clowns they want to play dress up don't eat bother it's almost giving them too much respect to bother doing a counter protest exactly let them go do their own neo-nazi Halloween and have fun admiring each other's well trim beards and calling each other funny names like Chad and and look look at how pathetic the alt-right neo-nazi movement has become when they're read or reduced to about don't worry guys I've got a diet book coming out go look at their hate rihanna counts it's amazing all the stuff they're trying to raise money for that are like my awesome little i just want to do like a car show and has nothing to do with like you know racial profiling or anything it's just so strange these little things that they're trying to brand themselves as yeah and i love that they're willing to do hatred of all these different ethnic racial religious groups but the one place where they draw the line is fetching they're like we cannot have that everything else is fine but that is really offensive curious place to draw the line support independent media come join us to the young turks TYT Network calm slash join
