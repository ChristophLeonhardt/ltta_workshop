1
00:00:00,615 --> 00:00:03,617
IMPACT ON THE MUELLER PROBE?

2
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:04,618
>> Trish: IT SHOULD.

3
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:06,786
IF WE GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS, WE

4
00:00:06,787 --> 00:00:07,787
DESERVE SOME TRANSPARENCY.

5
00:00:07,788 --> 00:00:09,155
WHAT BUGS ME IS THAT

6
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:09,823
VLADIMIR PUTIN IS SORT OF

7
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:12,792
GETTING WHAT HE WANTED.

8
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:13,460
LOOK AT THE STATE WE ARE IN

9
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:14,961
WHERE WE ARE SAYING WE DON'T

10
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:17,864
KNOW IF WE CAN TRUST OUR

11
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:18,832
GOVERNMENT.

12
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,333
AND I THINK IT'S A REAL

13
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:21,368
QUESTION, WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT

14
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:22,569
NOW IF WE CAN TRUST OUR

15
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:22,969
GOVERNMENT.

16
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,871
WE DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN TRUST

17
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:25,972
THE FBI, AND WHEN YOU THINK OF

18
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:28,942
THIS FULL CIRCLE, BUT A MERE FEW

19
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:32,679
GOT WHAT HE WANTED BECAUSE HE HS

20
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:32,712
GOT WHAT HE WANTED BECAUSE HE HR

21
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:32,746
GOT WHAT HE WANTED BECAUSE HE HC

22
00:00:32,747 --> 00:00:32,779
GOT WHAT HE WANTED BECAUSE HE HE

23
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:32,812
GOT WHAT HE WANTED BECAUSE HE H

24
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:41,187
OF CONGRESS BECAUSE AGAIN, FOR

25
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:44,324
OUT OF THE VERY FIVE GUILTY

26
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:45,992
PLEAS THAT MUELLER HAS GOTTEN

27
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:47,394
FROM INDIVIDUALS RELATED TO

28
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:48,595
LYING TO INVESTIGATORS OR LYING

29
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:49,696
TO THE FBI, SO FOLKS GO TO JAIL

30
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:55,602
REMEMBER WRITING THAT TEXT

31
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:56,336
MESSAGES AND I WAS REFERRING TO

32
00:00:56,337 --> 00:00:58,838
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, DON'T SPIT

33
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:00,774
IN MY FACE AND TELL ME IT'S

34
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:01,141
RAINING.

35
00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:02,909
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT FELT

36
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,209
LIKE.

37
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,511
AND >> Josh: I CAN'T DISAGREE

38
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:04,878
WITH THAT.

39
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,781
I THINK YOUR POINT THAT'S REALLY

40
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:09,149
IMPORTANT ONE, BEFORE WE START

41
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,883
ENGAGING IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT

42
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:12,952
REVEALING OUR INTEL METHODS AND

43
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:13,987
SOURCES AND HAVING A DISCUSSION

44
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,327
HAVE TO REALLY ASK THE QUESTION
