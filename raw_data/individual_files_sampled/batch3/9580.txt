CALLING IT A DIRECT ATTACK ON OUR DEMOCRACY. FOR MORE ON A HOST OF TOPICS FROM CAPITOL HILL, I’M JOINED BY FROM CAPITOL HILL, I’M JOINED BY SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL. SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GLAD TO BE HERE. Bret: WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE BRETT KAVANAUGH HEARINGS AND THE BRETT KAVANAUGH HEARINGS AND OTHER THINGS. FIRST, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS ANONYMOUS OP-ED IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES." TITLED "I’M PART OF THE RESISTANCE INSIDE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION," SAID TO BE A SENIOR TOP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL. ADDING, "IN THIS OP-ED, IT MAY BE COLD COMFORT IN THIS CHAOTIC ERA BUT AMERICANS SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE ARE ADULTS IN THE ROOM WHO FULLY RECOGNIZE WHAT IS ROOM WHO FULLY RECOGNIZE WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WE ARE TRYING TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT, EVEN WHEN DONALD TRUMP WON’T." YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS? I HAD NOT SEEN THIS PIECE UNTIL YOUR SET UP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW, SO THEREFORE I REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT, OTHER THAN I THINK IT’S IMPORTANT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO KNOW, IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHT OF CENTER, IT’S BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARILY PRODUCTIVE CONGRESS, FROM THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, CIRCUIT JUDGES, REGULATORY CHANGES, TAX REFORM, WE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARILY ACCOMPLISHED CONGRESS, AND THAT’S WHAT OUR MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE WAS ABOUT, FINISHING UP THIS YEAR’S PHYSICAL YOUR BUSINESS. Bret: YOU DID MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT TODAY, HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN. THIS OP-ED SUGGESTS THAT DESPITE THIS OP-ED SUGGESTS THAT DESPITE HIS LEADERSHIP STYLE, THESIS SUCCESSES ARE HAPPENING. YOU AGREE WITH THAT? IT’S BEEN A GOOD TEAM. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN INTERESTED IN THE THINGS WE WANTED TO PURSUE. WE’VE BEEN ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH ON ALL OF THOSE ISSUES, TAXES, REGULATIONS, SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, CIRCUIT JUDGES, ALL THOSE ISSUES, WE’VE BEEN IN THE SAME PLACE. HE SIGNED THEM INTO LAW AND I SAID, IF YOU ARE AN AMERICAN OUT SAID, IF YOU ARE AN AMERICAN OUT THERE WHO PREFERS THE COUNTRY RIGHT OF CENTER, THERE HASN’T BEEN A BETTER CONGRESS AND THE TIME I’VE BEEN IN THE SENATE. Bret: HE HAS ADDED TO, IN THE WAKE OF THE BOB WOODWARD BOOK AND HIS REACTION TO THAT, THAT YOU HAVE THIS ANONYMOUS OP-ED, YOUR INTERACTION TODAY? WE WERE TALKING ABOUT FINISHING THE PEOPLE’S BUSINESS BEFORE THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THREE CONFERENCE REPORTS AND APPROPRIATION BILLS, SOUNDS BORING TO YOUR AUDIENCE BUT 9 OUT OF 12 OF THOSE ARE SIGNED INTO LAW BEFORE THE END OF SEPTEMBER, THAT WILL NOT HAVE OF SEPTEMBER, THAT WILL NOT HAVE HAPPENED SINCE 1997, OVER 20 YEARS AGO. COMPLETING A FARM BILL. AMERICA IN GENERAL IS IN GOOD SHAPE. AGRICULTURAL AMERICA IS NOT. WE ARE INTENT ON FINISHING THIS FARM BILL, GETTING IT SIGNED BEFORE THE FARM BILL EXPIRES AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE WERE FOCUSING ON. Bret: THE LAST THING ON THIS, ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THERE THIS, ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE INSIDE THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO BRING THIS ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO BRING THIS PRESIDENT DOWN? MY JOB IS TO TRY TO ACHIEVE AS MUCH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS I CAN. THESE REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENTS DON’T COME ALONG VERY OFTEN. NOT MANY AMERICANS KNOW THIS BUT NOT MANY AMERICANS KNOW THIS BUT WHEN YOU GO BACK 100 YEARS, ONLY WHEN YOU GO BACK 100 YEARS, ONLY 20 OF THE 100 YEARS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AT THE WHITE HOUSE, HOUSE, AND CENTERED WHITE HOUSE, HOUSE, AND CENTERED AT THE SAME TIME. WE DON’T WANT TO SQUANDER THAT OPPORTUNITY. I THINK WE’VE DONE A LOT FOR THE I THINK WE’VE DONE A LOT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE WILL DO A AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE WILL DO A LOT MORE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. Bret: I DON’T WANT TO BELABOR THIS POINT SO I WILL MOVE ON, THERE WAS AN EFFORT BY YOUR COUNTERPART, SENATOR SCHUMER, TO KIND OF SLOW SENATOR SCHUMER, TO KIND OF SLOW THINGS UP ON THIS KAVANAUGH HEARING. TAKE A LISTEN. TAKE A LISTEN. THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IS DELIBERATELY OBSTRUCTING THE SENATE’S CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO FAIRLY AND THOROUGHLY CONDUCT OUR ADVICE AND CONSENT POWERS. SO ORDER IN THE CHAMBER. AS A RESULT, WE WILL NOT CONSENT TO BUSINESS AS USUAL ON THE SENATE FLOOR TODAY. Bret: NOT TO GET TOO MUCH IN THE WEEDS, EXPLAIN WHAT I WAS IN THE WEEDS, EXPLAIN WHAT I WAS ABOUT. HE WAS TRYING TO SHUTDOWN THE HE WAS TRYING TO SHUTDOWN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARING. WE SIMPLY ADJOURNED THE SENATE TO PREVENT HIM FROM DOING THAT. YOU’VE SEEN THE ATTICS AND COMMITTEE, YOUR NETWORK HAS BEEN COMMITTEE, YOUR NETWORK HAS BEEN CARING AT, ALL THE HOOTING AND HOLLERING AND MISBEHAVIOR. BUT NONE OF THAT HAS MAKING A DIFFERENCE. THE PRESIDENT NOMINATED AN ALL-STAR. I CAN RECOGNIZE A GREAT LAWYER WHEN I SEE ONE. BRETT KAVANAUGH IS A GREAT LAWYER. HE’S GOING TO BE CONFIRMED BEFORE THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND BE ON THE COURT WHEN IT STARTS ITS NEXT SESSION THE FIRST MONDAY IN OCTOBER. Bret: SENATOR SCHUMER’S POINT, THE COMPLAINT REALLY IS BEEN UPHELD, SOME CAME OUT LATE, BEEN UPHELD, SOME CAME OUT LATE4 BEEN UPHELD, SOME CAME OUT LATE, BEEN UPHELD, SOME CAME OUT LATE0 ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN UPHELD, SOME CAME OUT LATE. BEEN UPHELD, SOME CAME OUT LATE. SOME HAVE FALLING UNDER THE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE FROM THE BUSH AND ADMINISTRATION. RESPONSE TO THAT COMPLAINT? MORE PAPER HAS BEEN PRODUCED FOR THIS NOMINEE THAN ANY NOMINEE IN HISTORY. WE HAVE 12 YEARS OF DECISIONS ON WE HAVE 12 YEARS OF DECISIONS ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT WHICH ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO HIS NOMINATION. EVERY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE SCREAMING ABOUT GETTING MORE PAPERS HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED THEY WILL VOTE AGAINST HIM. WHAT ELSE DO THEY NEED TO KNOW? THEY ARE ALREADY AGAINST HIM. THIS IS A SMOKE SCREEN. WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE ARGUING ABOUT PROCESS, YOU KNOW, THEY GOT NOTHING ELSE. WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH, THERE IS REALLY NO GOOD ARGUMENT NOT TO CONFIRM THAT. Bret: YOU COMPLAIN, THOUGH, BY THE DEMOCRATIC TACTICS, PUSHING BACK AGAINST KAVANAUGH. BUT WHAT ABOUT MERRICK GARLAND, AND WOULDN’T YOU HAVE THROWN A FIT OF DEMOCRATS TREATED A G.O.P. NOMINEE THE WAY YOU TREATED GARLAND? LOOK, I WAS QUOTING JOE BIDEN LOOK, I WAS QUOTING JOE BIDEN IN 1992, WHO SAID IF A VACANCY OCCURRED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THEY WOULDN’T FILL IT. DEMOCRATIC, SENATE, REPUBLICAN, PRESIDENT. CHUCK SCHUMER AND HARRY REID SAID, 18 MONTHS BEFORE THE END OF THE BUSH YEARS, IF A VACANCY OCCURRED, AND A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR, THEY WOULDN’T FILL IT. I KNEW IF SHE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT, AND WE HAD A VACANCY NOMINATING A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT TO A DEMOCRATIC SENATE PRESIDENT TO A DEMOCRATIC SENATE AND THE MIDDLE OF A PRESIDENTIAL AND THE MIDDLE OF A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR, THEY WOULDN’T FILL IT. LISTEN, THAT WAS SIMPLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I SAID, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS LIFETIME APPOINTMENT, AND WHOEVER THEY CHOSE, MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE HILLARY CLINTON. WAS GOING TO BE HILLARY CLINTON. WHOEVER WAS BEING ELECTED IN THE WHOEVER WAS BEING ELECTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT HERE OUGHT TO MAKE THAT DECISION. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. THE DEMOCRATS LOST. Bret: YOU KEPT THE SENATE AND SESSION FOR PART OF AUGUST TO HANDLE SPENDING BILLS AT THE PRESIDENT’S REQUEST. YOU MADE THE MOST PROGRESS, AS YOU MENTIONED, AND SPENDING BILLS IN 20 PLUS YEARS. WHY WOULDN’T THE PRESIDENT OR TO WHY WOULDN’T THE PRESIDENT OR TO THOSE UP BECAUSE THERE IS NO MONEY FOR A WALL? IS THAT STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT IS THAT STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT THIS THING ALL COMES CRASHING TO THIS THING ALL COMES CRASHING TO A HALT? NO, THE NINE BILLS WE WILL PUT ON HIS DESK BEFORE THE END OF SEPTEMBER, WHICH IS THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR, DEAL WITH OTHER SUBSTANCE. BUT IT ALSO, 90% OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET, WILL HAVE BEEN APPROVED BEFORE THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. AS HE POINTED OUT, THAT HADN’T HAPPENED SINCE 1997. WE STILL ARE IN FAVOR OF THE WALL, WE STILL WANT TO GET FUNDING FOR THE WALL, BUT WE THINK ♫ ♫ ♫ Bret: A FOX NEWS ALERT. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT FINISHED COMMENTING ON "THE NEW YORK TIMES" ANONYMOUS BED. HE MADE SOME STATEMENTS EARLIER BUT NOW JUST TWEETING ONE WORD WITH A QUESTION MARK. "TREASON"? OBVIOUSLY REFERRING TO WHOEVER WROTE THAT OP-ED. WE ARE HERE THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER. TREASON? I DON’T HAVE ANY OBSERVATION TO MAKE ON THIS EPISODE. Bret: LAST THING. I MEAN, FOR SOMEONE TO WRITE AND I MEAN, FOR SOMEONE TO WRITE AND TO BE QUOTED IN BOB WOODWARD’S ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PO ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PL ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PM ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PI ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PS ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PT ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PE ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PP ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PE ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PI ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PE ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PT BOOK AND TO THEN WRITE SOMEONE ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PS ELSE PERHAPS, THE ROOT OF THE PS AMORALITY, IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION? LOOK, I WOULD LIKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO JUDGE THE RESULTS THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED IN RESULTS THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND WE ARE NOT THROUGH AND I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS, OF FOCUS ON OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS, OF WHICH I THINK THERE ARE AN ENORMOUS NUMBER. Bret: NO CHANCE, GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN? NO CHANCE OF A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. Bret: ZERO? ZERO. Bret: IN MARCH, THE PRESIDENT THREATENED NOT TO SIGN PRESIDENT THREATENED NOT TO SIGN THE OMNIBUS BILL AT THE LAST MINUTE, EVEN THOUGH HE HAD NEGOTIATED IT. DO YOU WORRY THAT YOU MAY HAVE AN AGREEMENT ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND THEN YOU DON’T? I DON’T WORRY ABOUT THAT. WE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION TODAY. I EXPECT HIM TO SIGN THESE NINE BILLS INTO LAW. THAT WILL FUND 90% OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS, BEFORE THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THEN I EXPECT US TO DO A SHORT TERM CONTINUE RESOLUTION FOR THE TERM CONTINUE RESOLUTION FOR THE BALANCE OF THE FUNDING AND THEN HAVE THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO FUND THE WALL AFTER THE ELECTION. Bret: HAS THE SHIP SAILED ON REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE? NOW YOU HAVE SENATOR JOHN J NOW YOU HAVE SENATOR JOHN N NOW YOU HAVE SENATOR JOHN K NOW YOU HAVE SENATOR JOHN L NOW YOU HAVE SENATOR JOHN I ON REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE? NOW YOU HAVE SENATOR JOHN N NOW YOU HAVE SENATOR JOHN N THE POSITION OF THE LATE SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, WHO VOTED NO ON THAT. SENATOR KYL PERHAPS WOULD VOTE YES. AS REPEAL AND REPLACE, THAT SHIP AS REPEAL AND REPLACE, THAT SHIP GONE FOR THIS YEAR? FOR THIS CONGRESS, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. I THINK WHETHER WE CAN ACHIEVE IT LATER DEPENDS UPON THE RESULTS THIS FALL AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE TO AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF CONGRESS THEY WANT TO HAVE COMING INTO THE NEXT TWO YEARS. Bret: WHAT ARE REPUBLICANS RUNNING ON? IT DOESN’T SEEM LIKE A TOTALLY UNIFIED MESSAGE. IS THERE ONE? I THINK THE ECONOMY. IT’S A RED-HOT ECONOMY. THE POLICIES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS HAVE ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS HAVE MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE, WHETHER IT IS TAX REFORM OUR REGULATORY RELIEF. THE COUNTRY IS BOOMING. THESE ARE RECORD NUMBERS THAT WE THESE ARE RECORD NUMBERS THAT WE ARE PRODUCING, UNEMPLOYMENT, GROWTH, THAT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE ALL ACROSS OUR NATION. THAT IS A RESULT OF THIS REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT. WE THINK WE HAVE PLENTY TO IRAN, WE THINK WE HAVE PLENTY TO IRAN, NOT TO MENTION THE FACT WE ARE TRANSFORMING THE COURTS, TWO SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, 26 NEW CIRCUIT JUDGES, MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF EVERY DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF EVERY LITIGANT TO THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY GO GO TO COURT. Bret: THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT BEEN SHY ABOUT TALKING AND TWEETING ABOUT HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL, JEFF SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL, JEFF SESSIONS, WHO YOU KNOW VERY WELL, HAS BEEN WHO YOU KNOW VERY WELL, HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE IN RECENT DAYS ON THAT FRONT. THE PRESIDENT JUST TODAY WAS ASKED ABOUT IT. HE SAID THIS. "I HOLD JEFF SESSIONS IN THE HIGHEST REGARD, I APPRECIATE HIS HIGHEST REGARD, I APPRECIATE HIS SERVICE TO THE NATION." ARE YOU WITH VICE PRESIDENT PENCE OR PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THIS? I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF, I’M A I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF, I’M A HUGE SUPPORTER OF JEFF SESSIONS, HUGE SUPPORTER OF JEFF SESSIONS, I THINK IS DONE A GREAT JOB AND I HOPE HE STAYS WHERE HE IS. Bret: YOU THINK HE WILL? WE’LL FIND OUT. Bret: WE JUST FINISHED THE MEMORIAL SERVICES FOR JOHN McCAIN. TELL US ABOUT YOUR LAST CONVERSATION WITH SENATOR McCAIN AND YOUR EMOTIONS AS THIS WEEK CAME TO AN EMOTIONS AS THIS WEEK CAME TO AN END. I WENT OUT TO SEE HIM IN MAY. I WENT OUT TO SEE HIM IN MAY. WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO RELIVE OLD BATTLES, WE WERE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF MANY, MANY ISSUES, AND THEN ON THE SAME SIDE OF OTHERS. I WAS PLEASED I HAD A CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE. JOHN LOVED A GOOD VIBE THAT I DID, TOO. WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD ONE THAT WENT ON FOR TEN YEARS AND ENDED UP IN THE SUPREME COURT. WE EXPRESSED OUR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER. Bret: CAMPAIGN FINANCE, OBVIOUSLY OUR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER, AND IT WAS A PERFECT WAY TO SAY GOODBYE. Bret: WRAPPING THIS UP, SPENDING, FARMVILLE, OPIOID PREVENTION, FAA AUTHORIZATION? I THINK WE ARE STRONG TO HAVE I THINK WE ARE STRONG TO HAVE A BIPARTISAN OPIOID BILL. WE WILL GET FAA AUTHORIZATION
