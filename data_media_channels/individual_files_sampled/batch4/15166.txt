Trudeau did not in fact declare yesterday to be a day against Islamophobia as an official holiday but he did tweet a condemnation of Canada I think which he tends to do he he does that pretty much everywhere he goes he tweets his shame about Canada he gives speeches about how were just not good enough he did that in this Davos speech remember that he condemned Canada as being too sexist Canada were the most female-friendly country in the world I would think seriously I appreciate someone who is personally modest who was personally self-reflective and self-critical don't you like someone with self-effacing humor who always cracks jokes about himself that's it that's a good person to know but that's not what's going on here Trudeau is criticizing you and me not himself he posits himself as the solution to our shameful bigotry Trudeau never criticizes himself he criticizes Canadians and here's what he said yesterday here's his statement he grieves with those who lost six family members and that is appropriate he speaks in solidarity with the Muslim community and that is a good thing to do to Momoa to remember six people who were murdered but then he says this he just can't help himself he says we will continue to fight Islamophobia and take action against it and all other forms of hatred and discrimination and defend the diversity that makes Canada's strong I say again there might in the end be Islamophobia or more accurately a hatred of Muslims involved in this mass murder there might be there might be discrimination but the police haven't laid any such charges and there is yet no evidence to that effect it may be but the trial hasn't happened yet but Justin Trudeau never misses a moment to condemn Canadians as hateful only he is truly loving Ahmed Hassan the Muslim migrant who has become our immigration minister he tweeted this he said one year ago we lost our brothers and then he lists their names and that's great that is a fine thing to do that is a good thing to do but then just added this he said we must all acknowledge and stand together against rising hatred and Islamophobia in Canada unquote sir sorry what what rising hatred and Islamophobia in Canada I know there are a lot of Islamophobia hoaxes that girl in Toronto a few weeks ago remember that woman in London Ontario who allegedly pulled another woman's head jab the media had a field day in it but the suspect herself turned out to be Muslim it was a Muslim on Muslim fight but the media said it was the same a phobia sorry what what rising hate you've got a Muslim migrant who is now a senior Cabinet ministration that proof that Canada is not hateful Canada's Muslim population has doubled in the past ten years mainly through immigrations if we are a hateful place why are so many Muslims coming here that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
