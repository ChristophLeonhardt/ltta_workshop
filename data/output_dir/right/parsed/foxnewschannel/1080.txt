>> DONALD TRUMP MOVING FULL
STEAM AHEAD TOWARD SINGAPORE
WITH JUST DAYS UNTIL THE
HISTORIC SUMMIT.
THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SAYS IT
IS ALL ABOUT ATTITUDE, NOT
PREPARATION.
WHAT ATTITUDE DOES HE NEED FOR A
MEETING WITH AN UNPREDICTABLE
DICTATOR LIKE KIM JONG UN.
NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST SENIOR
FELLOW REBECCA HEINRICH JOINS US
NOW WITH HER INSIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US,
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT THIS
MORNING.
THAT IS A BIG QUESTION.
HOW DO YOU PREPARE FOR MEETING
WITH KIM JONG UN.
WHEN THE PRES. SAYS IT IS
WITH KIM JONG UN.
WHEN THE PRES. SAYS IT IS ALL
ABOUT ATTITUDE, WHAT TYPE OF
ATTITUDE DO YOU NEED?
>> YOU NEED TO PROJECT
CONFIDENCE AND THAT IS WHAT THE
PRESIDENT IS DOING.
WHEN HE SAYS IT IS ALL ABOUT
ATTITUDE HE IS PROJECTING
CONFIDENCE WHICH IS WHAT HE
SHOULD BE DOING.
SECRETARY OF STATE KIM JONG UN
HAD A WONDERFUL PRESS CONFERENCE
AFTER THE PRESIDENT HAD THIS
PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE
JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER IN WHICH
HE
DONALD TRUMP HAS
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN HAVING
HOURS OF BRIEFINGS SO DONALD
TRUMP IS VERY WELL PREPARED.
HE KNOWS ALL THE INFORMATION,
UNDERSTANDS WITH THE NORTH
KOREANS WILL TRY TO DO HERE AND
KNOWS WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR SO
IT IS POINT HE NEEDS TO GO AND
PROJECT CONFIDENCE, BE PREPARED
TO WALK OUT IF THE NORTH KOREANS
DECIDE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO
PLAY
IN EARNEST.
I AM PRETTY CONFIDENT GOING INTO
THIS WEEKEND AND THE NEXT WEEK
TO SEE WHAT DONALD TRUMP CAN GET
DONE.
>> TALKED ABOUT WILLINGNESS TO
GET THINGS DONE BUT DO YOU THINK
ON THEIR PART KIM JONG UN IS
WILLING TO GET THINGS DONE.
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY SIGNS OF THAT
ASIDE FROM AGREEING TO THIS
MEETING.
>> I REMAIN COMPLETELY SKEPTICAL
OF THE NORTH KOREANS.
I THINK KIM JONG UN IS LOOKING
FOR THINGS TO SECURE FOR HIS OWN
COUNTRY.
I DON'T THINK THE NORTH KOREANS
ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING RID OF
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUT
BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS SUCH AN
UNCONVENTIONAL PRES. AND IS SO
COMMITTED TO RESULTS, HE'S NOT
IDEOLOGICAL, THINGS LIKE THIS,
COMPLEMENTING HIM AND EXTENDING
THIS DIPLOMATIC OVERTURE TO HIM
THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN FROM AN
AMERICAN PRESIDENT MAYBE HE CAN
PULL SOMETHING OFF AND GIVE HIM
SOMETHING THAT WOULD PERSUADE
HIM THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH THE
COST.
>> I SAID ALL ALONG I THINK KIM
JONG UN ACTUALLY LOOKS UP TO
DONALD TRUMP.
I THINK HE RESPECTS HIS
UNCONVENTIONAL STYLE SO WE WILL
SEE IF THAT BENEFITS US IN THESE
NEGOTIATIONS MOVING FORWARD BUT
IN THE MEANTIME THE PRESIDENT
HEADED FIRST TO THE
TODD: SUMMIT WITH TARIFF TALKS,
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT AS THE
PRESIDENT HEADS TO CANADA TODAY?
>> DONALD TRUMP, THE TWEETS HE
SENT OUT YESTERDAY WHERE HE WAS
GIVING MACROAND A HARD TIME
ADJUSTING TO DO A HARD TIME,
THIS IS SOMETHING HE DOES, HE IS
NOT AFRAID TO MIX IT UP.
I'M NOT A BIG SUPPORTER OF
PUTTING THESE TARIFFS ON OUR
CLOSEST ALLIES BUT I'M NOT AN
ECONOMIST SO I DON'T HAVE A
SUPERSTRONG OPINION ABOUT THIS.
OTHERS NO MORE ABOUT IT BUT WHAT
I APPRECIATE HIS DONALD TRUMP
DOESN'T SEE THE ISSUES HE CAN'T
TOUCH OR CAN'T SAY THAT I CAN'T
DO THAT.
IS
DO THAT.
IS WILLING TO MIX IT UP AND
THESE ALLIANCES ARE STRONG AND
SO I THINK IN THE END YOU WILL
SEE THESE ALLIANCES THAT WILL
WEATHER THIS STORM, THEY WILL
COOPERATE AND PLAY BALL WITH
DONALD TRUMP AND WE WILL HAVE
STRONGER ALLIANCES BY THE END OF
HIS FIRST TERM IF HE DOES HAVE A
SECOND.
>> HE
POLITICALLY CORRECT SPEECH.
LET'S LOOK AT THE TWEETS YOU
WERE MENTIONING THAT HE TALKED
ABOUT, ONE ABOUT THE UNFAIR
TRADE.
WE CAN PULL THAT UP AND YOU
MENTIONED HE TALKS ABOUT HOW WE
NEED TO FIX THAT AND IT WOULD
BENEFIT US, YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT
THERE.
>> I APPRECIATE THE FACT, I
CHUCKLE WHEN I SEE THE SWEETS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET REALLY UPSET
AND WORKS UP AND THINK THESE
ALLIANCES ARE GOING TO BE RUINED
AND I THINK THAT IS NONSENSE,
DONALD TRUMP, THESE ALLIANCES
ARE STRONG, HE -- THERE IS SPACE
TO PUSH BACK AND SAY THESE
ALLIANCES ARE STRONG AND I WANT
A BETTER TRADE DEAL FOR
AMERICANS BECAUSE I'M HERE TO
REPRESENT THEM.
I'M NOT HERE TO REPRESENT YOU.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN
APPRECIATE THAT.
