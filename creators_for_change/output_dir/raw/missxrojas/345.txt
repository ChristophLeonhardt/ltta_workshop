which was then blue and covered in Harry

20
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,110
Potter stuff I had magazine cutouts in

21
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,880
every box I had puffy and mastery things

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,820
new flat and I've had to get rid of a

24
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,260
lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in general with the past</font>

25
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,910
few years just because I've been paring

26
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,469
down all my belongings and I don't

27
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,640
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about my relationships</font>

28
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,960
Harry Potter in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

29
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,329
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about me and these books and me</font>

30
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,829
and these actors and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I</font>

31
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,690
enjoy about them on some level whenever

32
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,399
I go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the books my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name I read</font>

33
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,600
them that there are still a very

34
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,550
personal thing but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me it's so much</font>

35
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,750
bigger than that the friends I've made

36
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,460
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the experiences I've had there's</font>

there's none of it really that's

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,370
untouched by harry<font color="#E5E5E5"> potter in some way</font>

39
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,690
our friendships are<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much bigger than</font>

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,890
harry potter<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i'm living with</font>

of our friendship and we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

experiences and as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as video</font>

50
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,570
blogging to an extent that have revealed

51
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,220
a real life of interviewing people and

52
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,900
finding out other people's stories and

53
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,520
then on top of all of that being 19

54
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,990
years old and on the red carpet for that

55
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,850
final harry potter<font color="#CCCCCC"> premiere interviewing</font>

56
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,950
the best filmmakers and the best actors

57
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,450
in the world you know just complete

58
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,430
Giants ray Fiennes and Jason Isaacs and

59
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,259
Judy waters and all of those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

60
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,939
has given<font color="#CCCCCC"> me masses of confidence and</font>

61
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,680
matters of drive and there's also made

62
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">me think that the things I enjoy doing</font>

63
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,009
like writing and reading and video

64
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,600
blogging and speaking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people they're</font>

65
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,369
not worthless and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even of</font>

66
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:48,869
less value than what<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people are</font>

67
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,520
doing and that to me was a really

68
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,960
important lesson to learn and I only

69
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,369
like that through this experience is

70
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,110
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love of harry potter i suppose</font>

71
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,030
opened up for me the chapel it's when

00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've been going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the states every year</font>

73
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,750
since 2008 but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> went tired</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I saved</font>

74
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,729
on I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had the opportunity see so much of</font>

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,200
the states which is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge country</font>

76
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying different climates and so many</font>

77
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">different little neighborhoods within</font>

78

I you know message on myspace and

82
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,480
chatted to occasionally in<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube</font>

heck watch community is another

85
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,349
community that's really important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

86
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:19,849
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nerdfighter community i</font>

87
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,380
exploded so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> after actually a</font>

88
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,640
deathly hallows that connection between

89

the harry potter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the nerdfighter</font>

90
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,310
community big parts of those communities

91
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,900
blended over at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that moment but without</font>

92
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,430
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross over there are other friends</font>

00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">i wouldn't have met or maybe I'd have</font>

met them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't be as close</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to them</font>

95

<font color="#E5E5E5">having those communities in my life has</font>

96
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,480
made me a much more positive person made

97
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,530
me feel more supported as well

98
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,060
especially in the last year it's not an

99
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,470
exaggeration to say I<font color="#CCCCCC"> really don't know</font>

100
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,880
what I would have done without these

101
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,280
communities<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the past year after</font>

102
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,049
everything that happened because they

103
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:46,580
just really have pushed me through it

104
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,010
and have made me think outside of myself

105
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,959
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these communities continue to do so</font>

106
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,880
much good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love that I just really</font>

107
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">not that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're also very human</font>

108
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,580
communities it's not i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

109
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,709
pretend<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all wonderful things happen</font>

all the time well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think Harry Potter's</font>
