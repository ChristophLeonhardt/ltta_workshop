1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,150
The Illuminati’s that shadowy cabal that
controls the entire world and ensures free

2
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,680
will is an illusion.
They’ve got a big Facebook page,

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,960
Celebrities like Jay-Z are accused of being members,

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,060
and there are weird YouTubers like this guy.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:32,920
"They had weirdos standing up everywhere, and then Beyonce--show a document of this if you can. She does the Illuminati symbol."

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:39,100
But what about the real history of the Illuminati
and how it became what it is today?

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,790
This is Bavaria, and in 1776
Adam Weishaupt, a law professor,

8
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,129
founded the Illuminati. It’s real.
He wanted to spread enlightenment ideals around

9
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:55,489
the world.
The goal was to infiltrate the monarchy and

10
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,780
make them more enlightened by entering their ranks.

11
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,159
Even though they were so high-minded, they had weird rituals.

12
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,060
See these owls? The Illuminati really loved them.

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,150
And they had invented hierarchies like Novice,
Minerval, and Illuminated.

14
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,990
Even though they were weird, they did have
some success around the world.

15
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:20,109
Anywhere from 650 to 2800 members infiltrated
Freemason chapters,

16
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:22,890
may have had influential members like the
writer Goethe,

17
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,070
and even might have influenced the Jacobins,
the political club that spurred the French

18
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,289
revolution to its most radical heights.

19
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:35,729
But they were destroyed in 1785.
This is Karl Theodor — the Duke of Bavaria

20
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,960
— and that year he banned secret societies.
That included the Illuminati.

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,509
Most historians think that it worked
and the Illuminati disappeared.

22
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,780
But if that’s true, then why do we still
think that Drake’s Illuminati today just

23
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,729
because he wears owl sweaters?

24
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:56,889
Since the beginning, conspiracy theories have
been part of the Illuminati.

25
00:01:56,889 --> 00:02:02,780
This guy, Xavier von Zwack, actually did have
plans to take over the world that were found

26
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,859
after the Illuminati was banned.
American historians and preachers thought

27
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,979
the Illuminati planted some seeds for the
French Revolution and

28
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,280
George Washington even wrote a letter
that claimed the Illuminati had once been

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,640
a threat.
But the Illuminati lost the limelight thanks

30
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,670
to the Freemasons.
This is George Washington as a Freemason,

31
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,000
and a lot of founding fathers really were
Freemasons. That inspired the anti-Masonic

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
party.
It was a legitimate movement with big names

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,400
like John Quincy Adams,
and the Illuminati paranoia faded around the world.

34
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,350
So how did the myth stay alive?

35
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,990
There were always random books, like this
one from 1918, or book reviews

36
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,860
that mentioned the Illuminati.
But most people think the Illuminatus book

37
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,880
trilogy of the 1970s
deserves credit for bringing the Illuminati

38
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:01,410
back. It might also be why weird secret symbols
like these pyramids and triangles are associated

39
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,950
with the Illuminati.
It was a funny series and gave new life to

40
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,070
the conspiracy for an ironic, connected age.
They were an evil organization bent on ruling

41
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,720
the world, sure, but they were also kind of
funny.

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,350
The Illuminati was vague enough to be refit
to any purpose, from

43
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,020
the new world order
to religious paranoia,

44
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,110
to pop culture curio like Angels & Demons.
It became a joke.

45
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,400
But you might believe that's what the Illuminati
wants you to think

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,640
if you noticed the 14 evil yellow triangles
of power hidden inside this video.

47
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,960
The Illuminati only really endures because
it’s disappeared and can look like anything.

48
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,530
There’s nothing to worry about.
Nothing at all.

49
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,030
Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati.

50
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,760
So this is my humble little crazy wall and
one of the disadvantages of a crazy wall is

51
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,410
that things aren’t as legible as you’d
like them to be. That includes this letter

52
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,670
by George Washington. However, the Library
of Congress does tell us what it says, and

53
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,900
it says, “It was not my intention to doubt
that the doctrines of the Illuminati and principles

54
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,140
of Jacobinism had not spread in the United
States.” So he thought the Illuminati didn’t

55
00:04:10,140 --> 00:00:00,000
make it in the United States, so you can rest
assured, but, they were a threat.
