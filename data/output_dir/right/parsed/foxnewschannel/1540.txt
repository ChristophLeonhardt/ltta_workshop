>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.
A LOT OF LAVA CREATING A NEW
THREAT IN HAWAII AFTER REACHING
THE PACIFIC OCEAN.
APPARENTLY IT SENDS UP TOXIC
FUMES AND GLASS-LIKE PARTICLES
IN THE AIR.
PHYSICISTS MICHAEL JOINS US.
FOR THOSE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA,
I KNOW OFFICIALLY, YOU KNOW, THE
HAWAIIAN AGENCIES AND THE LIKE
SAID THERE'S NO PROBLEM HERE.
YOU CAN FLY HERE.
NO CONCERN ABOUT LANDING AT ANY
OF THE OTHER ISLANDS, EVEN THE
BIG ISLAND.
FOR RESIDENTS IN THE IMMEDIATE
LOCAL, WHAT IS IT LIKE?
>> THE HEADLINE FOR THEM RIGHT
NOW, NEIL, KILAUEA IS A TRIPLE
THREAT.
2 1/2 WEEKS AGO, IT STARTED
OOZING VERY THICK, SLOW-MOVING
LAVA OUT OF CRACKS THAT SURROUND
KILAUEA, ESPECIALLY TO THE EAST
AND SLIGHTLY NORTH.
AFTER THAT IT STARTED SPEWING
SULFUR DIOXIDE, A POISONOUS GAS.
OVER THE WEEKEND, LAVA HAS MOVED
INTO THE OCEAN.
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, YOU HAVE FIRE
BASICALLY MEETING WATER AND THE
HYDROGEN CHLORIDE IN THE MAGMA
WHEN IT MEETS THE SEA WATER
CREATES HYDROCHLORIC ACID THAT
IS GOING IN THE AREA.
THESE POOR PEOPLE HAVE IT COMING
AT THEM IN THREE DIFFERENT
FRONTS AND THEY HAVE TO BE VERY
CAREFUL.
>> Neil: HOW WIDE IS THE DANGER
>> YOU KNOW, THE PLUME OF
HYDROCHLORIC ACID IS MORE THAN A
MILE.
FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN COVERING
VOLCANOS, IT'S THE IMMEDIATE
SOUTHEAST PART OF HAWAII.
I COVERED ANOTHER ONE IN 1991.
THAT WAS A MUCH MORE EXPLOSIVE
VOLCANO.
KILAUEA IS A SHIELDED LAVA THAT
OOZES LAVA.
EXPLOSIVE.
IN 1991, THE STUFF GOT SO HIGH
IN THE AIR GOT IN THE
STRATOSPHERE AND COOLED DOWN THE
EARTH.
I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING NOW.
THE EFFECTS OF KILAUEA WILL BE
CONFINED TO THAT REGION OF
HAWAII.
SO THOSE PEOPLE THERE IN THE
GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANT, THEY
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND VIGILANT.
THE SCIENTISTS HAVE TOLD PEOPLE
JUST -- YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'S
GOING TO GO.
WE HAVE TO SEE, WE'RE BETTER AT
PREDICTING VOLCANOS THAN OTHER
NATURAL DISASTERS LIKE
EARTHQUAKES.
THAT'S A PLUS.
>> Neil: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL STATE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF VISITORS?
>> I'D STAY AWAY FROM THE
SOUTHEAST REGION OF HAWAII.
I'VE BEEN ON THE ISLAND MANY
TIMES.
YOU CAN FLY IN TO THE OTHER
PARTS.
THE OTHER THREE QUADRANTS.
>> Neil: SO THEY'RE NOT
AFFECTED.
>> PERFECTLY SAFE.
NOT REALLY.
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT STAYING
UNDERSTOOD WIND OF THE
HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND IS SULFUR
DIOXIDE
DIOXID
DIOXIDE.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL IDEA.
>> Neil: INDEED IT IS.
