but didn't stop there dianne feinstein yesterday was put on the defensive by Kavanagh it was one of the great moments have seen in American political life Feinstein who's been slandering Kavanagh basically from the bench I don't mean in the legal sense but she's been saying things about Kavanagh that are unbaked with vindictive force she had to confront Kavanaugh and Kavanagh basically shredded her because there's one point here at which Kavanagh was asked specifically about the Julie sweatin dick allegations clip five and she was asked about he was asked about the the allegations brought forward by Michael avenatti that he was a gang rapists and here's how it went for Dianne Feinstein and and what you're saying if if I understand it is that the allegations by dr. Ford miss Ramirez and miss Feldt that sweat Nick are are wrong you that that is emphatically what I'm saying emphatically the sweat Nick thing is a joke that is a farce would you like to say more about it no and good for Brett Kavanaugh if Einstein came out today and she said I've never seen a nominee for any position behave in that manner judge Cavanaugh used as much political rhetoric as my Republican colleagues because you are all political hats who tried to destroy his life that's why it is perfectly appropriate for him to fight back in preservation of his family and his life Feinstein by the way ended up dumping her own witness under the bus she ended up dumping Ford under the bus so she was asked yesterday about how did all of these letters end up in the possession of the of the FBI in the media how did how did the media get ahold of these letters because remember originally Christine Blasi Ford sent a letter to Dianne Feinstein and said I want you to keep this anonymous and Dianne Feinstein then somehow magically this appears in the media anti in Feinstein says it wasn't me it wasn't me so who was it if it wasn't Feinstein they're only two other parties that had it and s you of California representative and Christine Blasi for herself but Ford has said that she didn't leak this to the media so here is Feinstein dumping Ford under the bus oh I don't believe my staff would leak it I have not asked that question directly but you do not you know that like I mean how in the world that get in the hands of the of the press the answer is no this staff have you ever asked you know have you asked your staff or other staff dance or the Judiciary Committee pardon me well a Jennifers reminds me I've asked her before about it well so that's true well somebody leaked it if it wasn't you well it was I'm telling you it was not I did not I mean I was asked to keep it confidential okay so she says that she it wasn't it that it wasn't it wasn't her which means there was somebody on Ford's team so there she is dumping her own witness under the bus as a politically motivated actor who wanted to get this stuff into the media amazing amazing stuff
