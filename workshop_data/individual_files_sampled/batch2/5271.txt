the mother of Sahid vassal made that impassioned plea for justice following the death of her son on Wednesday the Brooklyn man the father of a teenage son was shot 10 times shot at ten times by Newark police officers who claimed he points at an object they believed to be a gun in their direction that object turned out not to be a gun instead it was a piece of metal pipe vassals parents say their son dealt with mental health issues and the shooting has sparked outrage from members of the community who say Vasil was a familiar face in the neighborhood and that many knew he was mentally ill the shooting raises a lot of now depressingly familiar questions about the use of police force about the police use of force and how officers are trained to deal with people with mental illness and joining me now to discuss Harry Siegel columnist for The New York Daily News and Phillip a Tebow golf president of the Center for policing equity thank you both for being here I you know was following this story Harry who was also my alert my editor it Levy's that I so I follow what you write and you wrote about the experience of being at the hospital and seeing not a shooting victim being you know 10:00 to 2:00 but please well a different Hospital so they took they took this man after they shot him to the nearest hospital yes Kings County he found each of where he was pronounced dead meantime the officers who needed to be checked for any injuries they may have incurred in the course of shooting and killing him and hitting him nine times in about a ten second encounter yep in which they may or may not have even said where the police went to a different hospital at precinct over where no one knew they were I happen to be in that er yeah and there as they were talking about this and heard that commander assure a hospital worker don't worry the press doesn't know we're here no one does so this is how the police are sorting the sound afterward and in the meantime they're trickling out information about him in response to to the bad press and to the community outrage yeah so it's here's a video oh people are still upset here's another video let's week is criminal record yeah and in the midst of all that we still haven't seen the actual encounter with the police and those ten seconds so they're very selectively turning over cards here to try to explain an excuse in the meantime we still don't even know the names for instance of the the officers who write well absolutely and this is this is a pattern in film this hat this just happens to have happened in my neighborhood so you know it's it but it's it's very similar if not exactly the same is you go all the way back Patrick doors when all of them right that the story is gonna be the same thought he had a gun feared for my life shot him and her story right but I want to show you one of the things that they have leaked out they've leaked out transcripts of the 911 calls not the audio interestingly enough but also surveillance video that they say bolsters the fact that this person was threatening people so here it is so you see this young man who was obviously in the midst of some mental health issues he's pointing this metal pipe as he's walking up to various people now he's known in this neighborhood you you see how people are reacting I mean you can't tell how they're reacting and people are screaming we don't know s/m buddy who studies policing and the way that it should be done what should police officers do if somebody is frightening people is pointing something that some people who called nylon one thought might have been a gun or look like a gun what should what should they've done well it's hard to second-guess without all of the information yeah for sure when you're approaching someone you think is armed you want to approach at a distance we saw this in the response to the Tamir rice shooting yep that it doesn't make sense if you think someone's arm to roll right up on top of them yeah right but in addition if you've got folks who know the community then you can do better than what strangers who are looking at this you know what just random clips of video could do I want to make sure that we get this is an individual tragedy but there are elements of this that are absolutely nationwide crowd hikes is a neighborhood that's experiencing some gentrification right it's got people that are new to the neighborhood that don't know that this individual has mental health concerns but all the local officers all the community officers absolutely do it's also the case that the folks who know a little bit more about him say he started suffering mental health concerns when one of his friends was shot and killed by law enforcement and there was a settlement recently for that shooting so this is a tragic circle that is much broader than what you're able to tell with regards to the facts of the individual case but the fact the individual case are never the only facts that matter when black folks get shot and killed this way and I'm glad that you mentioned the gentrification piece because the Guardian has a piece out I'm gonna read a little bit of this and sorry this is a bit long just about the fact that who the officers were who were there I'm gonna ask you both about the NYPD says that it does designate officers per the Guardian to certain neighborhoods it says it divides precincts into four or five areas within each area the NYPD says the same officers work in the same neighborhoods on the same shift increasing their familiarity with local residents and local problems the perhaps significantly in vassals case the people who responded to the calls were not those officers instead the NYPD chief of Department Terrence Monahan said two officers from the strategic Response Group and three officers from the NYPD's anti-crime unit were sent to the scene last bit the strategic Response Group is a team that responds to incidents such as shootings and bank robberies and is also deployed to handle crowd control at protests and parades while anti-crime unit officers who were generally plain-clothed frequently deal with gun violence Monahan said three plainclothes officers and one uniformed officer shot at vessel the NBC the NYPD has not released the names of officers so they didn't send the guys who know the neighborhood they send the crime guys into a residential neighborhood and they start shooting so this goes back to him out of do actually and 41 shots and having gun cops show up in a neighborhood they don't know and that's one of the original sins of our policing the thing is when you have a gun call you do have more aggressive officers who are supposed to be responding to that the question is how well-trained they are and how serious they are again you don't just jump out and within 10 seconds and we haven't seen the video so yeah so we're just going on witness accounts start start doing that so it's understandable that you end up with different officers there at some of these points they should have EDP training for emotionally to serve people like this guy was and and and in this circumstance we're the only potential threat is to them they say he took a shooting stance you have again within 10 seconds and it's not clear they even say as much as police yeah or drop it nine shots fired and that is the sort of tragedy that makes people ask who is getting served and protected here yeah and when in film you know I keep going back to the fact walking around in - oi neighbor if the the fear is that this guy is going up to people in brandishing a gun ergo he may shoot someone but the actual incident it is that it is police officers multiple officers who start firing shots so the people who actually shot a gun in the neighborhood which could hit a bystander which could hit a child which could break a storefront window could hit somebody's shopping who doesn't even know it's gone the only people who fired a gun in that neighborhood are the police because all he had was a pipe so their fear was he might shoot someone so they shoot people this doesn't even sound like good Public Safety well the argument of course is self-defense and again without seeing the actual video of the incident it's very difficult to see what the officer saw but again we know that there's a tactic issue where if you're getting right up on somebody you you lose the option to de-escalate but I want to go back to something that Harry said in response to this as well which they should have EDP training there is no way tell me what ATP so emotionally disturbed person train right so critical incident training is is sometimes something much of the same thing there is no way that any Police Department in the country can train officers to be mental health workers at the same time that they are training them to be safe with weapons at the same time that they are training them to be social workers and Child Protective Services and the rest we ask our police to do too much and when you ask folks to do too much and they are afraid and they have the option to use coercive force you see coercive force more often than you need to and in exactly the same situations where you need someone who knows how to de-escalate and knows how to deal with mental health if we had not divested so much public goods from our mental health infrastructure then we wouldn't have the kinds of situations that we have here or charlena Liles in Seattle and countless other cases where mental health is dealt with with either incarceration or execution and the reality is it's the pressing you know but here you and I both know these officers gonna get off we know that's gonna go this is well one of the Diallo officers for instance is still with the NYPD there's no chance that they're gonna face anything other than small departmental penalties you're glad to speak it's depressing and it's it's not ending Harry Siegel Philip a to boot off thank you guys thank you for being here appreciate it and up next America's educators are rising on state you're watching MSNBC International this is not an echo chamber what is the project that the Republicans are pursuing this is not a one-way street overturning the norms of American politics was a campaign promise this is a dialogue the obligations right now for the members of my party remember your history that looks at the world that's what America first means to me country over party and all its complexities don't watch what they say watch what they do from every side it's exactly what the founders of this country imagined the full story never stands behind a podium do you think this is a problem for the president it's too widely for that far too elusive do you believe this could be a cover-up so you think now is the time to have this policy to make the full story needs to be drawn out is this new big wall gonna stop Mexicans from coming to the u.s. track down and boxed in there appears to be a clash between police and counter protesters the full story is a long long way from the headline you can see bad and that's the distance we cover why because I love the magic of politics when the star is aligned against the odds when a leader somehow happens I love the sheer human spirit of the Maverick the pro the hero you can have the OneNote wonders the flip floppers the hacks give me the gutsy the grownups honest give me the ones with fire in their bellies the ones who tell you why they're there those I can take and cheer non-stop there are still some votes that have not been counted I think MSNBC kicked into high gear and you could see it in the coverage night and day well talk to involve it's actually
