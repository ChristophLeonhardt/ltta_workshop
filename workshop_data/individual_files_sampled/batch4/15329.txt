members of the Canadian Chinese community continue to get defamed first it was by an 11 year old girl last month who falsely accused an Asian man of shredding her hijab but these days the Chinese community is being slandered by you guessed it the media party which seems to be implying that many of the members of this community who immigrated to Canada are anti-immigration if anything the Canadian Chinese community is not going quietly into the night regarding he jab hoax they want an apology from elected officials including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who was so quick to condemn the Fantom Asian perpetrator of the hijab shredding that never happened and they want the police to reopen the investigation to find out what really went down that day and well folks there really is so much of this fake hate crime story that simply does not add up but it looks like the Chinese community will receive neither an apology nor a new investigation despite protests that have brought out hundreds to both Queens Park and Parliament Hill and to add insult to injury check out the coverage their protests have received from the mainstream media coverage that at best is biased and that worse is outright falsified and even more inexplicably coverage that paints these Patriots as bigots and anti-immigration for example at the Toronto protests late last month that attracted some 500 protesters the number of fix to that gathering was around 30 according to the Toronto Sun and then CFRB morning man John Moore commenting on the sun's coverage said he could barely see ten protestors in the photograph yeah this was a piddling protest they say thirty I can barely find tan in a picture does this look like around 30 people or barely ten folks now I'm going to give the Sun and CFRB the benefit of the doubt here my hunch is that these reporters only made it to grade six math kind of like Jethro Bodine from the Beverly Hillbillies so hey five hundred might look like about thirty if you drop a zero and make the five of three and carry something as for mr. Moore hey when you only have ten fingers counting a large procession can make for a mammoth challenge but if that coverage was sheer fakery the coverage of last weekend's protests at Parliament Hill by Ottawa crime reporter chamois knee Yoga rectum was downright shameful thanks to its in hair bias now you ask why would a crime reporter be dispatched to cover a protest well folks read jhemini's story it's a crime all right for example jhemini seems to have more time and empathy for the anti-fog who staged a counter protest that day despite booing Oh Canada despite chanting obscenities at police officers sharmini quotes a man who identifies himself as Juan Juan and he says this quote there are some out-of-town conservative Chinese racists and they are collaborating basically with some white nationalist groups here in Canada as a Chinese Canadian I'm pretty ashamed about that end quote well to paraphrase a line from The Lone Ranger who was that masked maniac yet these Patriots seeking only an apology from the p.m. and an explanation from the police are being painted as conservative Chinese races yes Chinese people who fled the tyranny of communism are being branded as racists by white left-wing losers who brandish the hammer and sickle on Parliament Hill and these looms are the media darlings meanwhile The Huffington Post apparently didn't have anyone on the hill that day but they ran a truly inexplicable piece of pre-pro test coverage nevertheless by Vince Wong anyway the headline for long story is all you need to read quote the Chinese Canadian community can't fight racism with Islamophobia end quote well I'll be damned calling out a Muslim perpetrating a hoax and falsely smearing a member of another ethnic group is an example of Islamophobia like really that's how low the benchmark is now you know folks Edelman public relations recently released its annual trust barometer and get this the least trusted institution in 22 out of 28 countries surveyed is can you guess it yeah the media oh that must piss them off and when you look at how the hijab hoax have been covered by the mainstream media in which the offender is comforted and the victims are condemned you truly get an idea why so many members of the public buy into what Sean Hannity proclaimed in 2016 namely journalism is dead for the rebel media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks download the new rebel media app from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store to take the rebel with you wherever you go you
