drive it right where your crazy help build the home of progressives by becoming a TYT member click the link in the description box below FoxNews hosted a panel of independent voters and asked him a number of questions but they specifically wanted to get these voters thoughts on the migrant Caravan now what do they think about the migrant caravan or what do they think about the migrants on the caravan should they be allowed into the into the United States or has the propaganda from Fox News worked I don't know let's take a look at the first clip and see how big a problem is that that the United States has uneven immigration laws I think uneven immigration laws are a problem for any country and I think our immigration laws need to be modernized and updated but this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants sure so what should the United States do with those 7,000 people by the time it gets here it could be 10,000 gonna be 20,000 what should the United States feel about those people this is the mightiest country on the planet I think we can handle a caravan of people unarmed coming to this country so Letterman and well I'm saying to process them properly okay that's the most educated independent voter I have ever seen it's not a diss on independent voters because more and more people are becoming independent for the right reasons and the old days independent voters are like Republican Democrat I can't tell the difference that's not a very educated in politics viewer it might be they might be educated in dentistry right but they they didn't care enough about politics to know the giant difference between two parties these days there's a lot of independent voters who are sick of both parties and they're very educated as you just saw there so I love the Steve Doocy tried three different lines of attacks I mean it could be 7000 could be 20,000 yeah just pull that right hold that out of nowhere bacteria or something hey any guys like no he's actually you just want to let him into the country say no I want to process them like we normally do so Ducey's I could kill it moving on this guy so that was an example of the right-wing framing on the immigration an issue and I don't want anyone to fall victim to it now I don't think any of you would fall victim to it you're very smart you follow politics you watch the show but what I kept seeing over and over again at politican during debates was you know right-wing figures saying oh you just want open borders things you want to let anyone in but no it's not it's not a black or white issue right like there first of all we do have secure borders and so if you want to have a discussion about securing them further I get it the wall is a stupid idea especially considering the fact that 80% of illegal immigration is from people who fly into the country and then overstay their visas but anyway we'll move on from well but what if we built the wall so tall you couldn't fly over it you know that wouldn't be surprised if you proposed something like that I gotta be honest it'll be a beautiful strong wall that knocks down planes and you'll have a door a big beautiful door we deflate a plane could fly through the door to be fair okay so but but you know what I love is that this independent voter is aware of that ridiculous black or white framing and he immediately had an answer no I'm saying process them properly there is a strategy not a strategy but there's a method in place to deal with the situation like this so let's do it let's do what the law says that we're supposed to do so that was good real quick on the immigration there's a humanitarian crisis taking place in Central America and yet this issue gets turned into a complete political football there's very little honest discussion about what's actually happening it gets turned into talking points and errands you know treating treating this as an invasion is is a bad idea and it's gonna end horribly if it is treated such as that way so I think people have to realize yeah these these are human beings coming here and there needs to be a real solution duh for food in in dealing with sure but the backdrop is the midterms and so it all becomes political it's a mystery action who made a political Steve you did your network did your the ones who made it political it's not like Nancy Pelosi was like can you believe the caravan or Nancy Pelosi was like yay Caravan never gets haven't said a word about the caravan in fact you could blame the Democrats for not defending those poor people at all right but the Republicans have been on the attack Fox News has been on the attack but that those set of independent voters spend they were not buying what Fox News was selling and it was fantastic because juicy statement at the end was basically him trying to defend himself in Fox News for making it political because that's what they do why do you think this story is such a giant story leading up to the midterms it's all a way to energize Trump's base and so yeah they do make it political I do agree with that voter that it does turn into political football that you know in terms of politicians they don't really take the issue seriously they exploit the issue for political gain and it's pathetic and so we do want something done I mean during the Obama administration there were efforts at immigration reform I think it's stalled in the Senate if I'm if I'm remembering correctly in 2014 but either way I mean the Senate didn't even want to vote on it they didn't even consider it mm-hmm yeah I mean they've had years and years and years to do something and you can say hey look they just don't agree and that's fair but the Republicans keep claiming that they want immigration reform and then when you propose immigration reform and one by the way that is draconian it's twice indentured servitude we have to work fourteen years here and basically manual labor before we have a chance to become a citizen and they're like yet not good enough no not good enough what do you want it to be twenty-one years how long do you want to know their whole lives I'm here because they because in their minds put aside the racism for a second and in their that no matter how you slice it they're the effect of their action winds up becoming racist but their number one motivation for the Republican politicians is we think Latinos and it's true Latinos do vote for Democrats on average more than they vote for Republicans so let's just keep latina out of the country otherwise they'll vote against us or maybe you could try to help the Latinos in this country and then they might vote for you I don't crazy idea well also keep in mind you know a lot of Latinos are deeply religious right and so that could be a giant voting bloc for the Republican Party but they're so vicious against Latinos that it actually they end up hurting themselves that's why I love Trump kisses the Bible you know he's gonna say crin thien's 2 or whatever was he said and you know this is you know one of the most vibrant Christian regions in the entire planet and that just goes to show it's not about Christianity it's about being a white Christian look guys last thing on this is that and for months now the polina showed independence 60% against Donald Trump it's in that ballpark it varies a little bit but not by much and if you lost 60% of Independence tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick so this election especially in the house is going to be a disaster for the Republicans and not only men whatever Latino votes they had trying to drive them away it with great fervor they obviously they've lost african-americans they've lost women that are about two-thirds against Donald Trump now I mean these are monstrous numbers and and now they've lost independence and all the reasonable independencies we saw it in a CNN panel they were Trump voters who were independents and they had all turned on him now you've seen in a Fox News panel and they all say no not buying what you're selling tick tick tick tick tick tick tick this Republican Party is in a world of trouble what's what's astonishing to me is all of this against the backdrop of a relatively healthy economy by comparative you know standards for the US when you have those conditions it's usually supposed to be a gimme to the party that's empowering and that his numbers are this low with with the you know economic metrics being what they are yeah so we talked a lot about how we think the the metrics that people use are not the correct ones thought marketing you know no and obviously no I yeah absolutely so we're worried that wages are flat because they our etc but normally when the stock market is up and unemployment is down the party that's in control does well he's doing terribly despite those numbers and despite the media saying like the media is beating him up on other things because he they have to they're not beating him up they're just correcting him he says there's Middle Easterners in the caravan it's a total lie 100% lie me buddy if you don't say that that's not true you're not a reporter right but on the other hand because they want to be quote-unquote fair they turn around they're like oh the economy's booming economies wonderful to stock markets up we're all rich anyway markets great right and they say that stuff and still sixty percent of independents are against us right imagine if the economy and those metrics that they pay attention to turned a little bit oh so now there's two weeks before the likes but it doesn't matter man this guy is deeply deeply unpopular there is no magic he was just running against Hillary Clinton most establishment candidate there ever was the country the juries come in on a man with six out of ten people including independents don't like you you're in for a world of hurt like what you see click this subscribe button below and don't forget to ring the
