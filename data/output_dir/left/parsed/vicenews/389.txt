down it's got a win here fix win here so
this was an Iranian drone sent over
Golan Heights I shot it down with a f-16
but and so this is the the rel we
started down I'm oh not okay not with it
maybe with an f-16 and that then they
then sent missiles and artillery to
attack you and Golan Heights and then

that was it that was me we see it the
center was blown up by our by our
interception but these are the parts
that come from this Center you see that
