THE NUMBER TWO MOST LIKED TWEET
OF ALL TIME IS WHAT'S?
THIS TWEET FROM BARACK
OBAMA FOLLOWING THE
CHARLOTTESVILLE, NO.
NO.
GOOD JOB, GUYS.
WE'RE GOING TO GRAPHIC 11.
LET'S START THAT OVER.
THAT IS DIFFERENT AND IT IS
ACTUALLY A GOOD, POSITIVE TWEET.
ALTHOUGH IT IS A DR.
SEUSS
POLITICAL CARTOON ABOUT THE
ALT-RIGHT AND NAZIS.
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.
LET'S START THAT OVER.
THE NUMBER TWO MOST LIKED TWEET
OF ALL TIME IS THIS ONE
FROM BARACK OBAMA FOLLOWING THE
INCIDENT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE.
IT IS HIM OUTSIDE OF A WINDOW
WITH A BUNCH OF KIDS OF ALL
RACES QUOTING NELSON MANDELA
SAYING, NO ONE IS BORN
HATING ANOTHER PERSON BECAUSE OF
THE COVER OF HIS SKIN OR AS
BACKGROUND OR HIS RELIGION.
CONTINUING ON INTO THE NEXT
PEOPLE MUST LEARN TO HATE
AND IF THEY CAN LEARN TO HEY,
THEY CAN BE TAUGHT TO LOVE
AND CONTINUING FINALLY INTO THIS
ONE: FOR LOVE COMES MORE
NATURALLY TO THE HUMAN HEART
THAN ITS OPPOSITE.
QUOTE FROM NELSON MANDELA.
THE FIRST OF THE TWEET GOT 2.6
MILLION LIKES SO OBAMA WINS
IN TERMS OF TWEET LIKES OVER
ANYTHING TRUMP HAS EVER DONE.
FIRST OF ALL, IT IS
IRRELEVANT, OF COURSE, WHO
WINS ON TWITTER, EXCEPT THAT
TRUMP WILL THINK IT'S RELEVANT.
THAT WILL GET UNDER TRUMPÃ­S SKIN.
EVEN THOUGH WHO CARES, BUT TO
ME, THE REASON WHY THE
STORIES INTERESTING IS BECAUSE
LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT
REACTIONS OF THE TWO PRESIDENTS.
PRESIDENT FROM COMES OUT AND
GOES BOTH SIDES DO IT AND
WON'T CONDEMN NEO-NAZIS, THE
CLAN, AND WHITE NATIONALISTS.
OBAMA PUTS A PICTURE OF CUTE
BABIES FROM ALL DIFFERENT
BACKGROUNDS AND SAYS IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT YOUR SKIN COLOR IS.
IT'S A SIMPLE QUOTE FROM NELSON
MANDELA.
IT IS BOTH MUCH MORE
HEARTWARMING AND MORE POSITIVE
AND BETTER RECEIVED BY THE
NATION.
WAY BETTER RECEIVED BY THE
NATION AND ALSO, MORE SAVVY.
PUT CUTE BABIES IN YOUR TWEET,
YOU WILL GET MORE LIKES BUT
TRUMP CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT
BECAUSE HE IS BUILT ON HATE.
HE THINKS NO, I GIVE THEM HATE,
THAT IS WAY GOT ELECTED.
I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM MORE OF
THAT AND OBAMA GOES IN THE
OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND PEOPLE GO
REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD DAYS?
I THINK ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY
OF THE UNITED STATES THE SAME
WAY I THINK ABOUT WEIGHT NOW.
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN.
WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG, AS A WOMAN
AND YOU HAVE A PERFECTLY
FINE BODY.
YOU ARE CONSTANTLY NITPICKING
THING I WISH I LOST WEIGHT,
LOOK MORE TONED, I WISH THIS OR
THAT.
THEN YOU GET OLDER NATURALLY
CURE AGE KICKS IN, YOUR
METABOLISM SLOWS DOWN AND YOU
LOOK BACK AT YOURSELF WHEN
YOU WERE YOUNGER AND YOU ARE
LIKE I WISH I REALLY
APPRECIATED THE WAY I LOOKED AND
MY HEALTH BACK THEN.
I TOOK IT FOR GRANTED.
THAT IS HOW I FEEL ABOUT OBAMA
VERSUS TRUMP.
I WAS WONDERING WHERE YOU'RE
GOING WITH THIS.
BY THE WAY, IT IS NOT JUST FOR
WOMEN.
I LIKE MY HASKELL PICTURES WHEN
I THOUGHT I WAS OVERWEIGHT
AND IT'S LIKE YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHING YET.
YOU SHOULD'VE ENJOYED THAT
MOMENT THAT WE HAD VERY
LEGITIMATE CRITICISM OF BARACK
OBAMA THROUGHOUT THE BOY,
WAIT UNTIL YOU GET A LOAD OF THE
NEXT PRESIDENT.
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU
SHOULDN'T CRITICIZE OBAMA FOR
THE THINGS HE DID WRONG, COURSE
YOU SHOULD, BUT IF YOU HAVE A
SENSE OF PROPORTIONALITY, WE
COULD FILL UP NOT JUST OURS FULL
OF SHOWS, BUT YEARS FOR SHOWS
AND CRITICISM OF TRUMP IN THESE
JUST LAST SEVEN MONTHS AS
COMPARED TO OBAMA'S EIGHT YEARS.
IT IS NIGHT AND DAY.
I DON'T REGRET THE ISSUES
THAT I CRITICIZED OBAMA ON,
HOWEVER, I DO REGRET NOT
APPRECIATING THE FACT THAT I
DIDN'T WAKE UP WITH THIS SENSE
OF PANIC EVERY MORNING.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
AT SUCH A LOW BARBER OBAMA
DECLARED.
FOR ANYONE.
WE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND
OUR PRESIDENT DIDN'T CHEER
NAZIS.
YEA.
IT'S A WEIRD THING TO CHEER.
OR THREATEN NUCLEAR WAR.
WE ARE STILL ALIVE BECAUSE OUR
IDIOT MEGALOMANIAC MORON EVER
PRESIDENT DIDN'T ACCIDENTALLY
START A NUCLEAR WAR.
THAT IS A REALLY LOW BAR TO
CLEAR.
OBAMA CLEARED EASILY BY BEING
SANE.
IN ADDITION, JUST THE NUMBERS
ALONE ON TWITTER WERE PEOPLE SAY
THAT TRUMP HAS CHANGED THE GAME
AND IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE
PRESENT PERSONAL TWITTER,
BARACK OBAMA, DONALD TRUMP HAS
35.9 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON
TWITTER, BARACK OBAMA HAS
93.2 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON
TWITTER.
AND TRUMP HAS TWEETED 35.5
THOUSAND TIMES TO GET THOSE
FOLLOWERS THAT OBAMA HAS ONLY
TWEETED 15.5 THOUSAND TIMES.
TRUMPS BIG TWEETS THAT YOU SEE
ONLINE GET ANYWHERE, THE BIGGEST
ONES GET HUNDRED AND 80,000
LIKES TO MAYBE 200,000 LIKES.
THE FATHER'S DAY TWEET THAT
OBAMA MADE, JUST SAYING HAPPY
FATHER'S DAY, REFLECTING ON WHAT
IT MEANS TO BE A FATHER GOT 1.3
MILLION LIKES.
IT IS JUST THIS WEIRD SENSE OF
DISPROPORTIONALITY WERE PEOPLE
HAVE JUST MODEL LIFT TRUMP AS
THE PERSON WHO DOES BEST ON
TWITTER AND YES, HE HAS THE
ABILITY TO, THROUGH THAT,
COMMUNICATE IN A CERTAIN WAY TO
A SPECIFIC AUDIENCE BUT IT IS
MISREPRESENTATIVE OF HOW PEOPLE
REACT EITHER PERSONS TWITTER
BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE SENSIBLE
PEOPLE OUT THERE THAN NON-
SENSIBLE PEOPLE OUT THERE.
EVEN ON TWITTER.
FINALLY, LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH
THIS GREAT POINT THAT ONE
OF OUR HOST MADE.
MICHAEL SURE, BACK IN 2012
WAS COVERING THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION AND DONALD TRUMP
WAS THREATENING TO GET INTO THAT
RESPECT THEN.
HE WAS COVERING IT FOR THE YOUNG
TURKS ON CURRENT TV AND TRUMPET
GONE TO VEGAS SO WE SENT MICHAEL
TO GO LAST FROM QUESTIONS AND HE
WAS THE FIRST TO ASK DONALD
TRUMP AT THE TIME HEY, WHY
DO YOU THINK THAT THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE ARE CLAMORING FREE
TO GET IN THE RACE BECAUSE HE IS
ALWAYS LIKE PUFFING UP HIS CHEST
AND TRUMP SAID, LOOK AT HOW MANY
TWITTER FOLLOWERS I HAVE.
OF COURSE THEY WANT ME.
MICHAEL SAID, SNOOP DOGG HAS
MORE.
DOES THAT MEAN HE SHOULD RUN FOR
PRESIDENT?
OF COURSE TRUMP DID NOT KNOW HOW
TO ANSWER THAT.
HE WAS LIKE UH.
BACK THEN IT WAS REALLY FUNNY
BUT NOW IT IS BECOME SUCH A
CIRCUS THAT YOU THINK MAYBE DOUG
WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
KID ROCK IS RUNNING FOR
SENATE.
