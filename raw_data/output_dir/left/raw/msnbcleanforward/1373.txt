00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,578
DESPITE ALL THAT GOOD REPORTING ON MICHAEL COHEN, WE HAVE THREE

55
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,247
ON MICHAEL COHEN, WE HAVE THREE BIG NEWS OUTLETS ALL NAFG SAME

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,783
BIG NEWS OUTLETS ALL NAFG SAME BASIC SUBSTANCE ABOUT WHAT

57

BASIC SUBSTANCE ABOUT WHAT MICHAEL COHEN MIGHT BE CHARGED

58
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:57,585
MICHAEL COHEN MIGHT BE CHARGED WITH.

59
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:58,953
WITH. DESPITE ALL THAT GOOD REPORTING

60
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:04,091
DESPITE ALL THAT GOOD REPORTING I REMAIN CONVINCE THAT THE ONLY

61
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,759
I REMAIN CONVINCE THAT THE ONLY WAY WE’LL EVER BE SURE MICHAEL

62
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,994
WAY WE’LL EVER BE SURE MICHAEL COHEN IS BEING CRIMINALLY

63
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:08,296
COHEN IS BEING CRIMINALLY CHARGED IS THAT EVENTUALLY WE’RE

64
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,665
CHARGED IS THAT EVENTUALLY WE’RE GOING TO SEE MICHAEL COHEN BEING

65
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,901
GOING TO SEE MICHAEL COHEN BEING ARRESTED AND WE’LL BE ABLE TO

66
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:17,371
ARRESTED AND WE’LL BE ABLE TO READ THE INDICTMENT.

67
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:19,507
READ THE INDICTMENT. WHICH LISTS CRIMINAL INDICTMENT

68
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:20,475
WHICH LISTS CRIMINAL INDICTMENT AGAINST HIM.

69
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:22,410
AGAINST HIM. UNTIL WE CAN READ THE DOCUMENT.

70
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,912
UNTIL WE CAN READ THE DOCUMENT. UNTIL WE GET CONFIRMATION FROM

71
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:26,680
UNTIL WE GET CONFIRMATION FROM PROSECUTORS, I SORT OF FEEL LIKE

72
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:30,618
PROSECUTORS, I SORT OF FEEL LIKE I WON’T BELIEVE ANY OF IT.

73
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:32,186
I WON’T BELIEVE ANY OF IT. THERE’S SO MUCH SPEND BEING SPUN

74
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,122
THERE’S SO MUCH SPEND BEING SPUN ON THE ELEMENTS OF THIS ENTIRE

75
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,156
ON THE ELEMENTS OF THIS ENTIRE SCANDAL SURROUNDING THE

76
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:35,523
SCANDAL SURROUNDING THE PRESIDENT.

77
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,658
PRESIDENT. THE MICHAEL COHEN PART OF IT IS

78
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:38,693
THE MICHAEL COHEN PART OF IT IS I THINK THE WORST IN TERMS OF

79
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:41,829
I THINK THE WORST IN TERMS OF THE RATIO BETWEEN REAL

80
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,499
THE RATIO BETWEEN REAL INFORMATION THAT WE CAN PUBLICLY

81
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,602
INFORMATION THAT WE CAN PUBLICLY CHECK AND THE NOISE AND SPIN

82
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:49,037
CHECK AND THE NOISE AND SPIN THAT MIGHT HAVE NOTHING TO DO

83
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:50,538
THAT MIGHT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH REAL FACTS.

84
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:53,508
WITH REAL FACTS. THERE’S JUST A LOT OF BLA BLA

85
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:55,743
THERE’S JUST A LOT OF BLA BLA BLA ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN AND VERY

86
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:57,678
BLA ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN AND VERY LITTLE PUBLICLY CHECKABLE

87
00:02:57,712 --> 00:03:00,048
LITTLE PUBLICLY CHECKABLE INFORMATION THAT WE CAN BALANCE

88
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:00,949
INFORMATION THAT WE CAN BALANCE IT AGAINST.

89
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,251
IT AGAINST. TO THAT END, I THINK THERE’S ONE

90
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,453
TO THAT END, I THINK THERE’S ONE BIG RED FLAG IN THE REASON

91
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:09,023
BIG RED FLAG IN THE REASON FACTUAL RECORD ABOUT WHAT IS

92
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:10,425
FACTUAL RECORD ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MICHAEL COHEN THAT

93
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:13,228
GOING ON WITH MICHAEL COHEN THAT WE SHOULD TAKE NOTE OF.

94
00:03:13,228 --> 00:03:15,163
WE SHOULD TAKE NOTE OF. HOW THAT MIGHT RELATE TO THE

95
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:16,965
HOW THAT MIGHT RELATE TO THE LEGAL JEOPARDY OF THE PRESIDENT.

96
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:18,967
LEGAL JEOPARDY OF THE PRESIDENT. THERE’S BEEN SO MUCH INK SPILL,

97
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:20,535
THERE’S BEEN SO MUCH INK SPILL, SO MUCH HOT AIR BLOWN OVER THE

98
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:22,070
SO MUCH HOT AIR BLOWN OVER THE LAST COUPLE DAYS, AND FRANKLY

99
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:26,141
LAST COUPLE DAYS, AND FRANKLY WEEKS WHEN IT COMES TO COHEN.

100
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,876
WEEKS WHEN IT COMES TO COHEN. THERE’S SO MUCH NOISE ABOUT IT.

101
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:29,377
THERE’S SO MUCH NOISE ABOUT IT. THEY’RE BOTH POTENTIALLY

102
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,044
THEY’RE BOTH POTENTIALLY INTERESTING, RIGHT?

103
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:31,846
INTERESTING, RIGHT? LAWYERS GETTING LAWYERS IS ONE

104
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:32,147
LAWYERS GETTING LAWYERS IS ONE THING.

105
00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:33,482
THING. LAWYERS BECOMING CORROBORATING

106
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:37,386
LAWYERS BECOMING CORROBORATING WITNESSES IS AN EVEN BIGGER

107
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:37,686
WITNESSES IS AN EVEN BIGGER THING.

108
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:38,987
THING. I THINK THERE ARE STEPS WE

109
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:40,789
I THINK THERE ARE STEPS WE SHOULD TAKE TO AVOID BEING SPUN

110
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:42,991
SHOULD TAKE TO AVOID BEING SPUN OR MISLED ON BOTH THOSE STORIES.

111
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:45,427
OR MISLED ON BOTH THOSE STORIES. SO WE’LL GET TO SOME OF THAT

112
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,494
SO WE’LL GET TO SOME OF THAT AHEAD TONIGHT.

113
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:48,797
AHEAD TONIGHT. I FEEL LIKE, WHEN YOU SEE A

114
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:50,799
I FEEL LIKE, WHEN YOU SEE A STORY ABOUT McGAHN OR COHEN

115
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,669
STORY ABOUT McGAHN OR COHEN COMING DOWN THE PIKE, UNLESS IT

116
00:03:53,702 --> 00:00:00,000
COMING DOWN THE PIKE, UNLESS IT HAS PUBLICLY VERIFIABLE
