1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,800
“Tower, look at to the south, there's an aircraft crashing”

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,960
On Veterans’ Day in 2001, an airplane carrying

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,100
260 people dropped out of the sky shortly
after taking off from JFK.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,080
“An aircraft just crashed to the south of
the field”

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,600
The top fin of the plane broke off and fell
into Jamaica Bay,

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,340
and the rest of the plane crashed into a residential
neighborhood in Queens. Everyone onboard and

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,500
5 people on the ground were killed.
This was just 2 months after September 11th,

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,379
and it was reasonable to assume, as many people did,
that New York was being attacked again.

9
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:38,539
But investigators concluded that it wasn’t
terrorism that took down Flight 587.

10
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,979
And they knew that because of what they found
on the airplane’s black box.

11
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:52,149
What the press calls the “black box” is
actually 2 orange flight recorders.

12
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:56,850
The idea dates back to the 1950s, when the
first commercial jet had 5 accidents in its

13
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,829
first 2 years of passenger service,
and investigators realized how useful it

14
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:04,780
would be to have a record of what was happening
on the plane before the crash.

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,860
Early generations of flight recorders etched
the data onto metal foil.

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:15,020
By the 1970s they’d switched to magnetic
tape, and by the 90s, solid-state memory chips.

17
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,280
But overall, the concept has remained basically
the same, with 2 components:

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,509
The cockpit voice recorder stores the last
2 hours of sound from cockpit and from the

19
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:26,960
pilots’ headset microphones, on 4 different
channels.

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,460
In some cases, these audio recordings alone
can reveal what happened, as they did when

21
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,440
a Germanwings flight crashed into the French
Alps in 2015.

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,520
NBC report: “The plane begins to descend.
Air Traffic control calls. No answer.

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,980
The captain begins banging on the door, yelling,
‘For God's sake, open the door.’

24
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:50,720
Passengers scream in the background.”
In the case of Flight 587, that's the plane that

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,980
crashed into those houses in Queens -- the
cockpit voice recorder offered some hints

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,160
about what happened.
The transcript showed that before crashing,

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,560
the plane ran into some wake turbulence from the large 747 that took off just ahead

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,149
of Flight 587.
But that turbulence alone wouldn’t have

29
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:10,538
been enough to take down the flight.
So investigators needed information from the

30
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:15,950
second box: the flight data recorder. It captures
at least 88 types of data about the plane’s

31
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,450
position and instruments for the past 25 hours.
That data feeds into computer animations of

32
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,890
what happened before the recorder lost power.

33
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,540
And the black box data revealed that the pilots lost control of the plane

34
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,040
over the course 
of about 10 seconds.

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,060
And this line in particular stuck out -- it
shows what the copilot, who was flying the

36
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,120
plane, was doing with the rudder pedals in
response to the turbulence.

37
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,540
Pilots can maneuver planes along 3 axes, pitch,
roll, and yaw, which is what the rudder controls.

38
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,600
But they rarely use the rudder, because as you’ve
probably noticed, they can change direction by rolling.

39
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,200
Investigators concluded that the copilot probably

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,280
didn’t realize that his aggressive rudder pedal
movements were making things worse,

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,280
that they were putting enough pressure on the
the vertical stabilizer, that it detached

42
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,709
causing the plane to crash.
Because of the flight data recorder, authorities

43
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,609
could rule out both terrorism and mechanical
failure, and instead, blame pilot error and poor training.

44
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,540
No two airplane accidents are the same, but

45
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,660
the flight recorders are useful for every
case, provided that they survive the crash.

46
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,860
And they usually do. The recorders are installed
near the tail of planes where the force of

47
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,920
the impact is somewhat lessened.
And the memory boards are kept in steel

48
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,879
or titanium cases and surrounded by materials
that protect against high temperatures.

49
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,780
Often, the rest of the box will be destroyed,
but that doesn’t matter as long as the memory

50
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,579
unit is intact.
Of course, flight recorders that are never

51
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,469
found are useless.
They do have a beacon that activates underwater

52
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:56,769
and sends an ultrasound signal every second
for 30 days. That signal can travel through

53
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,060
14,000 feet of water.

54
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,120
But as flight MH 370 showed, sometimes investigators
aren’t even within that range.

55
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,560
BBC report: "But the batteries from MH 370 black boxes

56
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,800
are almost certainly starting to fail.

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
If they haven't already."

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,680
That’s why some have proposed new systems
that don’t leave the data on the plane,

59
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,510
but rather transmit it in real time to
satellites or ground stations.

60
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,330
There are privacy and cost concerns to consider,
but in the future, they might not need to

61
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,090
find a box, in order to find the answers the that investigators,

62
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,350
and families need.

63
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,820
Why does the press call it a black box when it's orange?

64
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,860
Very good question. The term "black box" is not actually used within the aviation industry.

65
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,580
I was told when I originally came here  there were a couple of different theories.

66
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:51,540
One, that the term black box is often used in engineering for a device where you have a lot of inputs.

67
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:59,040
It may go back to the early days of the recorder, where they used light-sensitive paper to record

68
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,500
traces from the stylus. And that equipment was housed in a light-protected black box.

69
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:12,340
There's also the idea that, as a result of the accident, once they've been expose to heat and fire,

70
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,940
that they turn black or a dark brown.

71
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,680
Nobody really knows where the term came from. But as I say, they're more appropriately called

72
00:05:21,680 --> 00:00:00,000
flight recorders or onboard recording devices and they're always painted a very bright orange.
