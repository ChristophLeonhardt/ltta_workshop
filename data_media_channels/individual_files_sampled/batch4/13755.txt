the hundredth day of the Trump administration is fast approaching and that means it will have been a hundred days since Donald Trump took office and that the first hundred days of his administration will be over and the word 100 will be said many times maybe even 100 president Trump made many promises about what he would accomplish in this period he promised to repeal Obamacare lower taxes wipe out Isis get in a couple of rounds of golf draw a funny mustache on the White House portrait of Barack Obama install cable service on Mars so he can continue to watch Fox and Friends even after the North Koreans make earth uninhabitable and of course issue new uniforms for NATO leaders modeled on those in the final scene of The Music Man now some slimy elite news worms and the mainstream media are complaining that with the exception of the Gulf and drawing the funny mustache on Obama's portrait Trump has not fulfilled his promises in his first hundred days which are so very urgent because those hundred days have the word hundred in them which is urgent because it's a hundred on the other side true freedom-loving Americans point out that Donald Trump is elevated to constitutionalist to the Supreme Court and that the Obama mustache was kind of a hoot just saying now to be fair to both sides except for the mainstream media because I mean Seth let's examine the true Trump accomplishments in his first hundred days Donald Trump has succeeded in not appointing a Supreme Court justice who would destroy the First Amendment in order to get back at those nasty Citizens United people who had the unmitigated gall to make a mean video about Hillary Clinton saying she wouldn't have been as great a president as she's been pretending to be in her bathroom mirror since she was 11 years old Trump has also managed against all odds not to appoint a Supreme Court justice who had erased the Second Amendment in the belief that guns are icky and who needs them when you've got perfectly good bodyguards who can carry guns for you Trump is also succeeded in not two posing a bunch of overseas tyrants and leaving utter chaos in their weight he hasn't opened our borders to every drug lord with an accent out of treasure of Sierra Madre who wants to set up shop in Phoenix and he hasn't worn colorless pant suits while making speeches in a screechy voice it sounds like a tomcat making with a pterodactyl now sure some might say that it's not enough just to point out that Donald Trump isn't Hillary Clinton and I'm sure they must mean something by that but I can't imagine what it is in conclusion I think we can safely say that this first hundred days of the donald trump's presidency has been the single greatest hundred days it ever happened instead of one hundred days that would have happened if donald trump hadn't been president for the last hundred days trigger warning i'm andrew Clavin and this is the andrew Clavin show
