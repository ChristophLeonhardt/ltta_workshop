00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:13,343
>> Sean: JOINING US NOW WITH

2
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:17,814
REACTION TO TONIGHT'S OPENING

3
00:00:17,815 --> 00:00:18,848
BREAKING NEWS, JOE DIGENOVA,

4
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:20,116
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR ANDREW

5
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:21,318
McCARTHY, AND OF COURSE HE

6
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:23,820
WRITES FOR THE NATIONAL REVIEW,

7
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:24,120
ALSO.

8
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,922
THE SMARTEST PERSON I KNOW.

9
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:28,525
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:31,294
SO, STRZOK GOES BEHIND CLOSED

11
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:32,696
DOORS AND SAYS HE'S GOING TO

12
00:00:32,697 --> 00:00:34,130
TALK, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE

13
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:34,397
IT.

14
00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:37,467
>> I THINK HE SOUNDS LIKE HE'S

15
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:38,234
ONE OF THESE GUYS THAT THINKS HE

16
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:41,171
CAN GO INTO THE ROOM AND KIND OF

17
00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:42,939
CONTROL THE ROOM.

18
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:52,182
HOROWITZ SAID HE HAD VERY

19
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:53,717
INVOLVED ANSWERS, SO HE MAY JUST

20
00:00:57,688 --> 00:00:58,722
AND IT DO OKAY.

21
00:00:58,723 --> 00:01:01,925
HE'S GOT REASONS TO THINK THAT.

22
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:03,526
BECAUSE IN A COURT ROOM, WHERE

23
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:05,528
THERE IS A JUDGE, SOMEBODY CAN'T

24
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:07,197
GET AWAY WITH JUST GIVING THEIR

25
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:09,132
SIDE OF THE STORY AND THEN

26
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,368
SAYING, WHEN YOU TRY TO

27
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,304
CROSS-EXAMINE HIM, NATIONAL

28
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:15,472
SECURITY REASONS, OR

29
00:01:15,473 --> 00:01:16,706
INVESTIGATIVE INTEGRITY.

30
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:21,277
STORY, NOW THEY GET TO ASK YOU

31
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:24,314
ABOUT THE HARD STUFF.

32
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:25,682
IN A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING, THEY

33
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:27,384
CAN DODGE THAT STUFF, THEY GET

34
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:28,985
AWAY WITHOUT ALL THE TIME.

35
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:31,988
>> I HAVE SOME FAITH WITH A FEW

36
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:33,723
OF THE CONGRESSMEN THERE.

37
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:36,726
YOU KNOW, ONE THING YOU SAID, IT

38
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:38,762
STILL STICKS WITH ME.

39
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:41,531
SO MANY OF MY -- MY MOM WAS A

40
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:43,333
PRISON GUARD, MY DAD WORKED IN

41
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:44,934
FAMILY COURT PROBATION.

42
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:51,708
MY COUSINS WERE ON THE NYPD.

43
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:57,514
THE TWO COUSINS WERE COPS.

44
00:01:57,515 --> 00:01:59,115
THEY BEGAN THE RUSSIA

45
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:00,917
INVESTIGATION WHICH I WOULD

46
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:02,118
ARGUE RENDERS IT ILLEGITIMATE

47
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:02,919
FROM THE GET-GO.

48
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,456
THIS IS THE GUY YOU ARE TALKING

49
00:02:06,457 --> 00:02:09,492
ABOUT, AND AS I SAID FROM THE

50
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:12,529
VERY BEGINNING OF THIS, JAMES

51
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,299
COMEY WAS A DIRTY COP.

52
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:16,933
MR. STRZOK IS DIRTIER.

53
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:18,935
HE'S GOING TO GO IN TOMORROW AND

54
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:20,937
HE IS GOING TO LIVE.

55
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:23,139
HE'S GOING TO GIVE EXPLANATIONS

56
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,875
THAT ARE UNTRUTHFUL.

57
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,248
ABOUT PRESIDENT OR CANDIDATE

58
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:32,749
TRUMP.

59
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,185
HE CAN'T WIN, CAN HE?

60
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:39,322
HE CAN'T HAVE HIM AS PRESIDENT.

61
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,727
NOW HE IS CLAIMING THAT THERE IS

62
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:47,564
AN EXPLANATION FOR HER, WE WILL

63
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:48,631
STOP HIM.

64
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:51,968
I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT.

65
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:53,536
>> YOU KNOW WE DON'T LIKE YOU

66
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:55,371
ARE TO PEOPLE I WOULDN'T WANT TO

67
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:56,406
MESS WITH IN COURT ROOM.

68
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:58,842
I KIND OF AGREE BUT THEN THERE

69
00:02:58,843 --> 00:03:01,411
IS THE INSURANCE POLICY.

70
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:02,879
THEN THERE IS A LOATHSOME HUMAN

71
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,179
BEING.

72
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,318
THEN THERE ARE THE ACTIONS.

73
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,185
NOW IT'S REAL.

74
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:10,353
AND THERE ARE SOME SUPERIOR

75
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:12,222
BELIEVE THAT HE'S DOING IT FROM

76
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:14,557
NOBLE CAUSES, BUT REALLY, HE IS

77
00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:18,361
ALMOST ATTEMPTING A COUP,

78
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:20,163
BECAUSE SOMEONE WAS GUILTY OF

79
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:20,897
CRIMES THAT HE PUSHES UNDER THE

80
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:21,164
RUG.

81
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:21,931
THEY GO FULL FORCE SLEDGEHAMMER

82
00:03:21,932 --> 00:03:23,399
ON THE OTHER CANDIDATE.

83
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,137
AT THAT TO ME IS INFLUENCING AN

84
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:27,737
ELECTION AND COLLUSION.

85
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:29,672
>> LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT

86
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:31,474
THIS.

87
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:34,344
THIS IS NOT A COMPLICATED CASE.

88
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:36,246
AT THE FBI OF THE SENIOR LEVELS

89
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:38,982
OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND

90
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:40,150
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,

91
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:42,452
LORETTA LYNCH AND ALL HER

92
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:45,155
MINIONS HAD TWO GOALS IN MIND.

93
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:47,757
VERY SIMPLE, VERY PLAIN.

94
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:48,758
EXONERATE HILLARY CLINTON

95
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:52,729
ILLEGALLY AND IF SHE LOCKED

96
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,931
STOMACH LOST THE ELECTION,

97
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:55,532
THAT'S IT.

98
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:56,432
IN A NUTSHELL IT'S NEVER CHANGED

99
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:58,768
OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND

100
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,337
EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE LEARNED

101
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:04,374
FROM THE TEXT MESSAGES, THE IG

102
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,644
REPORTS, HAS PROVEN CONCLUSIVELY

103
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,551
AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

104
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:19,355
PEOPLE WANTED TO DO.

105
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:27,130
AND IT WON'T MAKE MUCH

106
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:29,766
DIFFERENCE.

107
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:31,367
>> I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THESE

108
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:32,569
WERE TWO INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON

109
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,738
AT THE SAME TIME, AND WHETHER

110
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:37,707
YOU ARE A LIBERAL OR DEMOCRATIC,

111
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,942
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU LOOK AT

112
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:41,144
THEM AND SAY THE SAME QUALITY OF

113
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:45,348
JUSTICE WAS ACCORDED TO BOTH.

114
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:49,886
THE LAW.

115
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:54,524
EQUAL APPLICATION OF THE LAW, IN

116
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:56,125
OUR CONSTITUTION.

117
00:04:56,126 --> 00:04:58,561
THE BIGGEST MOST OBVIOUS CASE OF

118
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:00,897
OBSTRUCTION, THEY MADE EVERY

119
00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:01,364
CONSIDERATION.

120
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:05,401
THREAD EVERY NEEDLE, EVEN THOUGH

121
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:07,737
PEOPLE WENT TO JAIL.

122
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:20,116
PROTOCOL, FOUR TIMES USING

123
00:05:20,117 --> 00:05:22,885
BOUGHT AND PAID FOR POLITICAL

124
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:23,253
RESEARCH.

125
00:05:23,254 --> 00:05:25,355
>> ON ONE SIDE OF THE COIN WITH

126
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:27,590
HILLARY, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY BENT

127
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:31,361
OVER BACKWARDS TO NOT MAKE THE

128
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:31,961
CASE.

129
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:33,363
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, WHERE YOU

130
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:35,965
DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE OF A CRIME,

131
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,367
IT SEEMS THAT THEY SCORCHED THE

132
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:41,771
EARTH TO TRY TO STOP THIS

133
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:42,171
PRESIDENCY.

134
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:45,408
>> Sean: THAT TO ME IS A IS A

135
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,377
TENT AN ATTEMPT AT BYPASSING THE

136
00:05:57,354 --> 00:05:59,422
DEEPER THAN ANYTHING WE WOULD

137
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:02,258
IMAGINE WITH WATERGATE AND

138
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:14,704
WHAT THE FBI AND THE DO    DOJ A

139
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:14,771
WHAT THE FBI AND THE DO    DOJ D

140
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:14,804
WHAT THE FBI AND THE DO    DOJ T

141
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:19,809
SUBVERSION.

142
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,111
THEY SOUGHT TO SUBVERT AN

143
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:23,112
ELECTION, AND WHEN THE PERSON

144
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:26,349
THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT GOT

145
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,555
THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING IN

146
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:34,557
THEIR POWER, AND EVEN THOUGH

147
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:35,558
PETER STRZOK IS TESTIFYING

148
00:06:40,898 --> 00:06:41,931
THE CIA DIRECTOR IN COOPERATION

149
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:42,532
WITH CLAPPER.

150
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,334
NONE OF THIS WILL BE FAIR UNLESS

151
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:46,736
BOTH OF THEM FIND THEMSELVES IN

152
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:47,603
FRONT OF A GRAND JURY.

153
00:06:47,604 --> 00:06:49,972
>> I THINK YOU WILL HAVE A LOT

154
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:51,708
TO SAY TOMORROW BEHIND CLOSED

155
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:54,344
DOORS, BUT I WILL LET THE TEXT

156
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:55,311
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.

157
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:58,147
>> SHOULD THEY RELEASE THE

158
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:00,183
TRANSCRIPT?

159
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:01,184
CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO MAKE

160
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:01,484
THAT.

161
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:03,386
>> I ASSUME THEY ARE ASKING

162
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:04,187
QUESTIONS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

163
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:06,422
BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT INTO

164
00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:08,558
CLASSIFIED MATTERS, BUT I THINK

165
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:12,762
OFTEN DO?

166
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:15,198
>> WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO COME

167
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,467
UP WITH THINK JIM JORDAN'S THAT

168
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:19,235
HE REGARDS THIS AS STEP NUMBER

169
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:19,802
ONE.

170
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:21,637
SO IT'S STEP ONE AND THEN WILL

171
00:07:21,638 --> 00:07:22,805
BE A PUBLIC HEARING.

172
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:24,607
>> I THINK THESE PEOPLE WILL GO

173
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:27,577
TO JAIL AND ITS WORST ABUSE OF

174
00:07:27,578 --> 00:00:00,000
POWER WE'VE EVER SEEN.
