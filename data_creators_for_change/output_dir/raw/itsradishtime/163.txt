cool scary stories to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys but</font>

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm one you know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> most people have a</font>

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,219
favorite childhood toy like something

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:15,960
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they really loved and just play</font>

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,850
with all the time well we're getting to

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,830
a time where for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

11
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,050
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them that was</font>

12
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,119
their computer and there are a lot of

13
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,279
old white dudes right think pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

14
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,109
Millennials that are really upset<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

15
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,170
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think it's pretty awesome like</font>

16
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,630
I fully believe that using technology

17
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,160
and using the internet from such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> young</font>

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,890
age has made me a much smarter and more

19
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,629
interesting person than I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

20
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,489
otherwise so what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world look</font>

21
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">like in the late 90s okay there's your</font>

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,070
scary story at first we had no internet

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,440
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still had some sick computer games</font>

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,210
like remember putt-putt ghosts moon

25
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,160
which oh my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can watch people</font>

26
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,920
play links below I played Freddie fish

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,920
and math blasters and Mario teaches

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,050
typing and Peter up<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's math garden</font>

29
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,059
which is so important in my life because

30
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,729
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's radish time comes from</font>

31
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,590
so you solve all these math problems in

32
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,030
the game and every time you win a level

33
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,810
peter rabbit jumps out and he goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

34
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,760
radish time and then these radishes just

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,100
like rain from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen you</font>

36
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,020
gotta click them all because<font color="#E5E5E5"> later you</font>

37
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,420
get to trade in the radishes for flowers

38
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,210
which was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important to me at</font>

39
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,430
the time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you to whoever it was</font>

40
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,259
who was developing like children's

41
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,659
educational games in like nineteen

42
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-six because you've shaped like my</font>

43
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,750
entire social media presence and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

44
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">for like an absurdly large portion of my</font>

45
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,100
anyway then the internet happened

46
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,590
only true 90's kids will understand my

47
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">mom has her own business so we shared</font>

48
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,829
dial up with her office<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means that</font>

49
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I came home and went to Nick calm</font>

50
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,509
to play<font color="#CCCCCC"> The Wild Thornberrys game she</font>

51
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:09,399
got booted up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet and I got</font>

52
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,680
massive trouble I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also obsessed with</font>

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">this web site called whyville it was</font>

54
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,330
this massive RPG you could play games to

55
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,580
earn clans and trade those four lengths

56
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,280
outfits and cool stuff and tell him lock

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,879
more games it was all wildly educational

58
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,000
like there was math and history even

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,799
physics think I may have learned

60
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:31,420
everything that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> still remember about</font>

61
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,790
math from computer games and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hated</font>

62
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,410
math but that's probably why I was

63
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,569
really good at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it anyway and I still</font>

64
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:39,730
learn on the internet every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day so if</font>

65
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,920
other kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like me more power to</font>

up in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a computer screen and you</font>

68
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,530
