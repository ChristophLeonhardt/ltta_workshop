well but reality is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very I think</font>

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,840
that we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be celebrating cultures</font>

17

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,760
first tentative ability for God's

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,370

22
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,320
not about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question looks like my</font>

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,610
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess is just like that</font>

24
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,400
speaks a lot for Millennials so you like

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,470
you are speaking to

26
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,570
party of popularity with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> social</font>

27
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,660
media<font color="#CCCCCC"> present so I i love the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> millennial</font>

28
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">generation you hold them on issues with</font>

29
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,580
a Republican or Democrat

30
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,880
good

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,650
stuck in some of the thinking

32
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,580
I think ways of staff

33
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,390
about differences and about divisions

34
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,100
and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think Millennials</font>

35
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,060
of reckless sharing

36
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,150
I'm inspired<font color="#E5E5E5"> by that generation so it</font>

37
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,740
reflects a lot of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> body and swipe</font>

38
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,450
secrets it's a natural connection I

39
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,280
think how this would make real estate

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,140
when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't operate in an authentic</font>

41
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,410
space and so I just try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the best</font>

42
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,580
version of myself as possible

43
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,659
