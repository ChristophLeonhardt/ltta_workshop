I think Doug Ford is a real chance to be premier to remember that for all the insults and smears and shrieking against him from the mainstream media Rob Ford became mayor of Toronto and done Ford almost did - check out this map it is a map showing all the wards of the city where Doug Ford not Rob Ford but Doug one the blue bars he won nearly half the city if Ford can replicate that and also do well in the smaller cities and rural parts in the north of Ontario I think he's got a real chance it's not gonna be a fair fight of course it never is the media is hostile of course but I don't think that works as well as it used to do the media thinks that people hate Doug Ford hate conservatives well surely some people do but a lot more people hate the media they don't trust the media and the media is already showing it's partisan colors so are other groups to look at this outrageous attack ad published just today by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association that is an allegedly nonpartisan charity it has charitable status under the Canada Revenue Agency now they are supposed to fight for civil liberties you know things like freedom of speech they're forbidden by law the law being the income-tax Act from being partisan look in this Ave are already campaigning against Doug Ford of course they are so will every union so every academic every NGO every anti-violent leftist every green scheme and scam profiteer who has lived the high life under Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals Justin Trudeau as well knows that if he loses Ontario to Doug Ford especially to a carbon tax flow like that you will have a very tough road ahead as he heads into his 2019 federal reelection year so yeah it is going to be a brutal 87 days for Doug Ford but that is a good sign the degree with which Ford's enemies hate him shows the degree to which they think he is a real force for change that is good if you're as desperate for changes I am as we are as conservatives are and hopefully as severely normal Ontarians armed and I started this monologue by saying that this is in just Ontario it is it's about anyone in Canada who's been conditioned who has been brainwashed who has been told to believe that we are lost we've lost the debate on the carbon tax or free speech or anything else so there's no point especially no point for conservatives to even be conservative know that false consensus was just smashed wasn't it the peasants are revolting aren't they it's not trumpism really but it is a related phenomenon it's people simply refusing to do what they are told to do by leftist politicians and pundits and journalists and all the fancy people including fake conservatives that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
