what do we know about the suspect in this case and why he might have done this hi there Chris good afternoon you're right a heartbreaking case especially when you think of those two people that were killed for their seriously injure now I can tell you this is a very fast-moving investigation right now the house behind me is actually a home of the suspects parents and federal investigators we're here over the last several hours left about 15 minutes ago ATF FBI agents really scouring this home as well as the suspects home not far from here they're searching for more info and the suspects past and trying to figure out why exactly he did this whether he had any accomplices and are there any bombs still out there so nearby is the suspects home we understand he had to live that he had moved out of his parents home about two years ago according to neighbors now our affiliate KPRC was at that other scene and shot some video of a person being taken into custody perhaps for questioning we do understand that investigators are questioning as many people as possible we don't know the relationship of this person that was taken into custody for questioning but we do know from the governor that the suspect lived with two roommates and from all indications right now is that they are cooperating with police we also understand that the parents of the suspect Marc Anthony Condit are also cooperating with police trying to answer as many questions as they can neighbors here in this area are stunned we spoke with one neighbor near his home a short time ago listen to what he had to say he seemed like a very normal kid which is what everybody says most neighbors say in these type of situations but you know over the years I there's nothing I could party so some more information about the suspect and then we'll talk about how police were able to track him down and some exclusive reporting there so the suspect did attend Austin Community College or at least took a course there from 2010 to 2012 he also was taking a course in US government shared his political views on a blog although we have no indication that politics had anything to do with his motive but it gives you an idea on his thinking that he's posting so many of these views online that's also what police are looking at as well now I can tell you Chris according to somewhere I'm reporting from our investigative team and according to multiple law enforcement officials is that investigators were able to connect all of these cases because they had a distinct signature and that is foreign exotic batteries that were ordered online and when according to one senior law enforcement official apparently came from Asia that's how they were able to piece this all together another key component of this case that allowed investigators to track the suspect down is cell phone tower analysis he according to investigators turned his cell phone on a few hours before police were able to catch up with him and so certainly that was a key break in this case as well Chris as you mentioned that surveillance video taking inside that FedEx facility authorities say that was also a key break in the case the governor saying that this was a very fast-moving investigation and local authorities say that with the help of the ATF and the FBI hundreds of agents they were able to bring this to a conclusion overnight hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
