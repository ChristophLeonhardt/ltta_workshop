so around a million children played hooky from school yesterday and took to the streets into television to demand that Americans give up the right to bear arms which the founders guaranteed in the Constitution since our news media was too busy fawning over these courageous adorable ignorant little blots they never got around to asking them the questions I'd like to hear these tots and tots answer here are some questions I'd like to ask the protesting children do you know what the Constitution is do you understand why the founding fathers thought to protect the right to bear arms from the government do you know who the founding fathers were do you know what government is can you name the three branches of government do you know the square root of 256 how does a bill become law who was James Madison have you done your homework why aren't you in school have you finished your chores do you even have chores have you ever read a book without pictures in it remind me again why you are in school how would it be if the next time you tried to take one of my constitutional rights away I took away your allowance and sent you to your room without supper go shovel the snow out of the driveway okay that last one wasn't a question in fact it was an order so why are you still standing there go shovel the snow little brat trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right we have Charlotte pence with us today the vice president's daughter she's written a children's book called a day in the life of the vice president and I got to talk to her a little bit about what it was like to be the daughter of a guy I said to her he is the most attacked for the least he doesn't do anything wrong and they getting attacked all the time we also have Aristotle is with us Aristotle is going to be kind of a daily wire contributor he's like you know we bring it on all the time we also have Jesus who you remember from our last sermon but a lot of guests on today but first we have to talk about what what should we talk about you know we'll talk about sleep I got home so late last night and I usually I really don't mind it you know but I wake I wake up about

branch com promo code Clavin they're really comfortable and when you wash them they get even more comfortable for some reason it's magic probably I have no idea why that happens so you we've been talking we talk a lot about this but I'm going to talk about it again because I just think yesterday it's so important after what I saw yesterday all these like a million kids all over the country protesting that the fact that we have the right to bear arms like protesting our Constitution a million no nothing little punks protesting the Constitution and one of the things I talk about is the fact that we have lost all of us even on the right a lot of us have lost the reasons why we believe what we believe and so when you lose the reason for something everything becomes a narrative nothing becomes argument nothing becomes logic nothing becomes actual debate it just becomes narrative and so children right make for good narrative and just to show you how we lose the narrative we lose the narrative remember Hillary Clinton was in Mumbai and she made those stupid remarks about how all deplorable you all are interesting remarks because basically she was saying if you weren't rich you didn't vote for her so she was the candidate of the rich she was admitting she was the candidate of the rich but the other thing she said was this is insulting things about about white women white women didn't vote for her because their husbands wouldn't wouldn't let them so here's what she said we do not do well with white men and we don't do well with married white women and part of that is a an identification with the Republican Party and a sort of ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband your boss your son whoever believes you should so there's the icon of feminism right who got where she is because of her husband the only reason she's anybody is because of her husband and Kellyanne Conway struck back at her saying this let me tell you something lady the idea that I or other women like me have to ask our husbands how the vote it's it's really a joke particularly since I won't say your name but I'll appeal to you directly particularly since this country knows who you are first and foremost because of whom you married and so stop pretending you're a feminist or for equality or for fairness to women and then running around accusing us of checking with our husbands and our significant others before we vote right I think that this is very representative of how angry and bitter and ungracious many in her and many have become in this country frankly and but you know what keep rolling the tape I had so many Democrats just want her to stop and I'm sure so many reporters just want her to continue so this is how feminism has won the narrative it hasn't won the argument it is one of the narrative the narrative is she now says I'm a feminist and then she makes a mistake and says something unfeminist and the right strikes back at her by saying oh you know you're not feminist we're the feminist we and the right you always hear the right saying this you know it's not the left who's feminist we're the feminist nobody says maybe maybe wives should ask their husbands why they vote maybe the husbands know more maybe the husbands know more about politics maybe the wives know more about something else what you know why is it insulting and maybe that is what happened and maybe it was the right thing that happened maybe these women are so happy so busy with their home and their kids have time to pay attention to politics so they say to their husbands honey who should I vote for and the husbands who were paying more attention tell them it would that be a sin it would be assumed in this in the religion of feminism it's not a sin in my life as honest an in my world but they've won that feminism has won the narrative whether it's right or wrong it is won the narrative so when these kids come out and they start talking and they you know it there's just all of them they're the you know like all teenagers all teenagers or they're Nazis and we'll get back to that minute all teenagers know what they know but because they don't they know what they know cuz they don't know what they don't know okay let us just get back go all the way back and this is why we have Aristotle with us today right Aristotle said the purpose the purpose of life says Aristotle is eudaimonia this is what Jesus is Jesus discusses why we have these shelves Jesus called life in abundance what I'm he said I'm here to give you life in abundance it's what we on the Andrew Clavin show called joy right joy is the purpose of life the joy is to live life with a great energy it's not to be happy because sometimes life is sad it is to be joyful involved in life to be your full self to be the self that God made is that is when your yesterday were we had went on the mailbag we were talking about shame somebody talked about fat pride and I said all pride marches are really shame marches because people feel ashamed of something whether they should or not they feel ashamed of something and they're blaming other people they think if they can just get other people to stop saying bad things about them they'll then be happy but that's not true you feel joy when you orient and orientate yourself toward the good and you know here are things that both Jesus and Aristotle said like Jesus said it's it's what comes out of a man's heart that defiles a man it's what's in a man's heart that defiles man he said a lot of people don't understand this part and he said you've heard it said don't commit adultery but I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart and what he's saying is you are you're not just what you do you are why you do it and Aristotle pointed this out too he said the good man is that is not the man who does a certain thing it's a man who is trained he's trained his passions to follow the good and we were talking about this I don't know a week ago about a guy who does what one guy doesn't cheat on his wife because he loves his wife and he believes that fidelity is a good and so he trains himself to to be faithful for that reason to want to be faithful for those good reasons for those internal reasons and another guy is faithful to his wife because his wife's father is a mobster and says if you ever cheat on my wife or my daughter I'll kill you you know those are two different people one is a faithful husband and one is just a coward and so it's really why you do how you do what you you know the good things that you do and how you learn to be free and how you learn to be good you have to be free to do that you have to be able to choose to do the good all joy comes from doing the good through passion and you have to be free to do that you would have to be free to do that so this this stuff came from Aristotle through Jesus these these two strains of thought the classic Greek thought and the Jewish thought came together and informed it wasn't like everybody who ever had a thought in Western civilization was thinking about this but this all informed all of Western civilization and they understood over time that people had to be free now you know when you lose when we lost the reason for doing good when we forgot what it is then you only have things that feel good you know you say and I don't mean just like pleasure you say well this makes me feel righteous we talk about virtue signaling right this makes me feel virtuous and in each a pointed out that that kind of good is really just a will to power that kind of good is really just saying I like this I think this is good and I want you to think it's good too because I have no argument I only have power so I want the will to power you know when you travel if you travel for a big company you get really great treatment you can always call people it's like being on a spaceship you know the spaceship has mission control you know you call that when you travel with a big business you get a Mission Control for every step of the way but when you have a small business you need

like on it's like having Mission Control you'll be like it's like you're going to the moon so this is true this is true before Nietzsche discovered it remember Pontius Pilate said to Jesus what is truth and people constantly I mean this is what Plato and Aristotle were arguing against was all the philosophers around them we're saying well good is relative you know just like they say now good is is relative there is no absolute good and Plato and and Socrates and Aristotle same and not so much and Jesus was saying no there is a thing called truth I'm it I'm the truth and if you follow me I will lead you to that truth so when you lose that all you've got is the will to power and narrative because narrative djinns up the emotions and it places you in a story that makes it seem like whatever the person is selling you is good and that's why they bring out these children it's also by the way why you have guns you have guns because people who don't know the good want to have power over you they want to impose their good on you which strips you of joy it strips you of the right to choose to do good right you that this is it all it really does all fit together you know this is why people get upset when they hear read Plato's Republic because he wanted to expel the poets because he didn't think they would teach people good but you do have to have a civilization that teaches you the good that is one of the things we had back in the 1950s when they would teach you why you were free they you know and when I went to school they would teach you why people had to be free and what it meant and why it mattered and now they don't teach you at that anymore they just have emotional arguments for why guns are scary take away the guns and that's why they bring out these kids right that is why they bring out the kids because they think the kids are the kids are an emotional prop they're an emotional narrative they're an emotional story now let me show you just I just show you for a minute how the networks first of all let me just show you one of the kids just pick a kid that we have in the it's Matt post number one it's the top one I believe that as students we need to make a few things clear to start we will not sit in classrooms with armed teachers we refuse to learn in fear we rejects turning our schools into prisons we will accept nothing less than comprehensive gun control and if it's what it takes we will shame our national policymakers into protecting us not just in schools but in churches movie theaters on the streets and the communities of color which are disproportionately devastated by the sickness of gun violence the lawmakers who failed to support us those who look for every answer to our nation's gun problem but the guns themselves will be complicit in every debt that comes after that so all of that all emotionalism is all emotionalism you know that there are more many more like three two or three times more violent crimes in England where there's not where there is a lot of gun control more violent crime in England than there is in the United States and people don't like to talk about that they also don't like to talk about the fact that you know polls are very confusing about what young people think about guns really a lot of young people are not for gun control these were this is a million kids which is an extraordinary demonstration but there's like 56 million kids in the country and some of these kids were in kindergarten so they know what the hell they're talking they just want to get out of school you know there was this there's a Second Amendment Foundation which saw a twelve hundred percent surge in youth membership so that's not being covered it's all this kid and emotion this bullying and because this is important with emotionalism it's important with you're doing a narrative not to let the opposite team get their narrative out that's why another reason you have to have censorship you don't need censorship if you have arguments right we don't need censorship on this show we don't need censorship at the Daily wire no right winger of substance is trying to censor anybody in America today only left wingers are trying to do it why because they have no argument they have no argument and if you watch here's a New Prague high school New Prague high school I guess in Minnesota one kid walks out with a sign that says guns don't kill people people kill people the principal of New Prague High School in Minnesota comes and chases in a way his narrative is not allowed look at this pointing his finger at him and let me just play one more thing and then we'll do we'll talk about something else but let me just play this this is an older video this was not yesterday of Alison cameras cut number 11 talking to these kids and listen to her feeding them the narrative right they're telling at first they get the emotionalism from them which is just pure bilge it's just utter bilge and then Allison Cammarata feeds them the narrative that they're supposed to deliver so what do you say to the NRA disband dismantle and take another organization different name don't you dare come back here the fact that you were in power for so long and that you had so much influence for so long in America just goes to show how much time and effort we still need to spend on fixing our country absolutely and gun control is just the first thing right now the first thing that we are mainly focusing on look I don't have to tell you guys they they give millions of dollars to politicians they have a very powerful tool so I mean how do you expect politicians who need money to keep running for office to say no to the NRA because we keep telling them that if they accept this blood money they're against the children they're against the people who are dying and that is that's there's no other way to put it at this point you're either funding the killers or you are standing with the children there's no other way to put it there's no other way to put it but listen to what Allison camerado did she's talked about the money that the NRA gives to support their point of view as if nobody else were giving money to politicians to support that point of view money is speech in America money is a way you get your your speech heard that the NRA has a point that the NRA is trying to support you know no they just wanna kid they want to kill the children that is why Dana lash goes to work every day and she says you know what I want I want dead kids you know that's what you say I mean it doesn't even make any sense the entire you know this is the other thing the entire thing doesn't make any sense because they're talking about essentially when you give up your guns you are trusting to the government it's the government that failed in Florida right they went 39 times to this guy's house this shooter's house didn't do a damn thing about it while the shooting was going on the cops waited outside it's the government that failed they hate the government Donald Trump is the most powerful man in the government he's the guy in the government but but let's trust him with you know with our our rights we trust Donald Trump but we hate Donald Trump but take our guns because something something you know it doesn't he sends its jibbers it is all emotionalism because they have lost the plot of America they've lost the plot of the West so all of this it requires silence and that's what we're seeing you know that my pal Steve Crowder was banned from Twitter and YouTube I think he still is suspended they call it for some you know Crowder's a comedian and he says all this outrageous things and this is another thing you'll notice by the way the left comedians are not funny anymore you know Jimmy Kimmel goes on and cries and Stephen Colbert is just bitter and and they used Donald Trump the way comedians second-rate comedians use the f-word they use Donald Trump because their audience will always laugh if they say Trump is stupid if they say Trump is corrupt if they say is in league with Russia it's the same as using the effort people will will laugh when you curse onstage and then you watch a guy like Jerry Seinfeld who never curses because he's funny he's really funny even even louis c.k who before he was shamed and cast out to the exterior darkness was really funny he used to do two kinds of material blue material which was okay and then his other stuff his observational stuff which was hilarious you know and that's the way they used Donald Trump they're not funny anymore Crowder is still funny and he's so he what was bents Christina Hoff Sommers who's been on the show a couple times we should have her back soon she went to give a speech at Lewis and Clark law school I think it was and they were shouting her down she writes about it in The Wall Street Journal today they shouted her down they played music and they you know they did try the the administration tried to speak but she couldn't and she was really cut short because the adults have lost their way they they're it's all emotionalism it's all narrative so they have to keep the other narrative silent so to show you how the adults are and here is a piece from the New York Times our favorite people from knucklehead Row do we have knuckle the knuckle head Rossum so I saw this article it came out two weeks ago or something and I kept seeing it around and the headline was so stupid that I thought it wasn't gonna be worth reading except to make fun of but when I read it it actually is not a stupid article all the way through it's really a sad article it's by a guy named Tim Crider who's a teacher and it's the headline is go ahead Millennials destroy us okay go ahead Millennials destroy us and he says he's an aging gen Xer but listen to what he says because it's not what you think it is it's not at first what you think it is he says like most people in middle age I regard young people with suspicion the young and the young at mind tend to be uncompromising absolutists and that is exactly right why because they don't know anything when you don't know anything you have to make extrapolation generalizations from a very small piece of information you talk to a baby and the baby sees a dog baby thinks the dog might be a person how does he know every living thing you seen talks and interacts with them but the dog doesn't he has to learn things before he stops making gigantic generalizations so the guy says the young and the young at mine tend to be uncompromising absolutists goes on I am creeped out by the increasing dogmatism and intolerance of Millennials on the left I felt a generational divide open up under me last year when everyone under 40 seemed to agree that Dana Schutz his painting of Emmett Till and his coffin should be removed from the Whitney when I was young it seemed the natural order of things the Conservatives were the prudes and skulls who wanted books banned and exhibitions closed while we liberals got to be the gadflies in a conic class I know that whenever you disapprove of young people you're in the wrong because you're going to die and they'll get to write history but I just can't help noticing that the liberal side isn't much fun to be on anymore and that's what I'm talking about Crowder is still funny because Crowder can say whatever he wants and think whatever he wants he doesn't have to worry about insulting blacks and something except on Twitter and YouTube because that's where they'll ban you for being funny for being free for being free that's what they ban you for they ban you for being free okay so he talks about the left has become puritanical censorious grim she and and they and they shut down speech I guess that's saying it twice in stories they shut down speech and young people are exemplified this so that's where he starts all right and then he says yet this uprising of the young against the ossified monolithic power of the National Rifle Association has reminded me that the flaws of youth it's ignorance naivete and passionate Manichean idealism are also its strengths young people have only just learned that the world is an unfair hierarchy of cruelty and greed and it still shocks and outrages them they don't understand how vast and intractable the forces that have shaped this world really are and still think they can change it revolutions have always been driven by the young this is also true and revolutions have always always ended with bloodshed despair and slavery only one revolution has worked a revolution of Englishmen against if Englishmen was actually a civil war and that's the American Revolution that's the only one that has improved the lives of the people who revolted so this is his final word my message as an aging gen Xer to Millennials and those coming after them is go get us take us down all those cringing provincials who still think climate change is a hoax that being transgender is a fad or that socialism means purges and re-education camps just because it does rid the world of our all our outmoded opinions vestigial prejudices and rotten institutions gender roles is disfiguring as foot-binding the moribund invent Pyrrhic two-party system the savage theology of capitalism rip it all to the ground I for one can't wait till we're gone I just wish I could live to see the world without us in other words he is giving up on adulthood he is giving up on the Western story he is giving up on freedom because he has forgotten what it's for he has forgotten eudaimonia is forgotten life in abundance he has forgotten joy that only comes through virtue that only can be found when you are free he has forgotten what the let the West is about and so he was saying tear it down tear it down what does he think will rise up instead what does he think we'll replace it they've lost the plot so they're calling on their children to destroy them it's an amazing thing and by the way I saw this once before I lived through the 60s I saw the children rise up I saw the adults give cede their authority I saw them say oh I saw them bought off by sex I saw them say Oh a world in which we can have sex with anyone we want good great tear down Western civilization I saw them allow young people to take over the places in college at least there were college students at least they've learned something in life instead of these tots you know but it was still the same thing it was all these kids who did not understand what the West was about and so they were happy to tear it down hey-ho hey-ho Western Civ has got to go that's what they used to chant and they and the adults gave ground we should tell these kids to go back to school sit down do their homework and shut up here is one child however she's not really a child very bright young lady but here's a child who was raised a lot differently than some of these kids uh our Charlotte pence is of course the daughter of Vice President Mike Pence and she is establishing a budding career out here in Hollywood in film production and literature she's well we talked about this in the interview she joined me a few days ago to discuss her new children's book which is called Marlon bun doze day in the life of the Vice President and if it follows her pet rabbit Marlon bundo and you ask yourself why is he named Marlon bundo and that will all be revealed and the rabbit takes her through a day in the vice-president it is actually kind of a nice little teaching tool for children all of those children were out instead of being in school yesterday could have read this book it's all for a worthy cause - she's donating part of the proceeds to a 21's fight to end human trafficking in the 21st century an actual good cause here is Charlotte pence discussing her new book Charlotte thank you for being here it's nice to see you it's nice to meet you I've never met you before yeah thank you for having me this is awesome you are the author you are now an author I may say of the book a day in the life of the Vice President was Marlon bundo the rabbit right now on the back the rabbit is real yes he's a real natural he's my rabbit yeah you have this you keep this ramen the rabbits a good pet he is yeah I got him in college he lives I mean he lives at the Naval Observatory now because you know he has official duties no bonus but you know he did he later being the bunny he was with me in college um I got him for a film project and he lived with me for a couple years and it was great Wow yeah don't turn your back on him all right so you're writing a children's book about a day in the life of the vice president would you know about because you are the daughter of the vice president which I have to say I'm a big fan of your father's I am like I call him i I've completed his name into mensch because I think he was one of the most solid people in the administration I have never seen seriously a man attacked more for less what is when that's your your dad what is that like what's it like to have a guy who's under fire like that I mean well I think about it in this way I think that I mean when you're a public servant it does come with the territory it never feels good to see someone you love be attacked especially for things that you know aren't true about them especially but I think you know my dad has this saying that he always says and I've taken it to heart he always says when we see protesters at events or protestors outside our house sometimes he'll say you know Charlotte that's what freedom looks like and so it is and I think that that's part of taking criticism and as a daughter I might not like seeing somebody that I love he talked about in that way but as an American it makes me really proud because it means that we live in a country in a society where people can speak out against their elected leaders and they're allowed to do so wow that's a dwindling perspective that it's so it's it is the right one it's the only way you can be free if you were allowed for me exactly here's here's the thing that always I always wonder about this because he is portrayed in such a hostile way obviously the one that was the big one was on the view recently where they said he was mentally ill because he talked to Jesus like everybody else America it when you're sitting there talking to the guy he's your father you know him pretty well yeah is he completely different than the pictures that you see there's a picture you get of him in the press Oh human being I think it's hard for me to know I mean because I don't think I'd take anything in the press seriously that would portray him in such a negative light I know he's you know the I mean I don't know most open-minded kindest person I mean the best idea of a father of a man an example of a good person in my mind to me so I feel like anything that depicts him otherwise I almost don't even really pay attention to just because I know he's I mean he's he's the best example of a father like I can even think of that you could even make up I mean it's just full of compassion and teachable moments all the time and I I mean I love him I look up to him I respect him we disagree on things sometimes too and we have open debates all the time in our house and on the phone and he's always been the most patient person to come to with questions and he'll explain his side of the view but then he'll also come back and say you know what do you think about it and he's you know that's very nicely this is why I never let my children get interviewed because they wouldn't say they wouldn't say any of these obviously you're you're raised in a religious family and now you're working in Hollywood which is the exact opposite how do you like the human sacrifices you you work where are you at UTA yeah you're at United talents okay yes so you're actually working you're working for a Hollywood agent right is the opposite of religion how do you find working I honestly it's been really great um honestly yuichi especially has really been very welcoming to me that's great and it's it's it's good I mean I think I I tell conservatives all the time you know come on in the water's fine um I think that there's probably a perception Hollywood gives off a little bit of being pretty liberal a little bit I mean honestly I I've met a lot of a lot of liberals I've met a lot of conservatives I've made a lot of friends and I think at the end of the day when people meet you there's a person you know and you are a person they like or they don't like and I think that in a way I've really been blessed to be able to come out here and be able to work in the industry I always wanted to work in and and and be accepted I think that yeah I think Hollywood is a place that has lots of different viewpoints and I think that those viewpoints are starting to be talked about more I think one of the things is I think if you're at a talent agency where people have a business Minds you do mean more conservatives I mean I meet back I can talk to agents a lot of times more than I can talk to the talent because the talent is so far on one side yeah but it can be really difficult to deal with them I mean if you're if you were looking for work as talent in Hollywood it can be really tough openly conservative views you were also working for epiphany yes yeah I worked for a company near in Boston actually like right outside of Boston oh it was a fun production company yeah so a couple different experiences there yeah I know Mike flowers a good guy sure you write a book you read to first will you read children's book but what is the plan is the plan to go into the movies or is the plan to be a writer or a boat your father called and he was asking no what is she doing no I've I mean I've always been a writer since I was a little kid a storyteller I was up at night telling my sister stories to help her sleep and you know just late into the night on car rides I think I've always wanted to tell stories um and so in in school in college I transition that into telling stories through filmmaking I think that that'll always be personally that I want to do and also in the documentary side but I I've always been also a narrative writer too and it's kind of where my passion lies really that's that's so happy to hear that because I decided that's what I like this is written in poetry anyway and the life of the vice-president is written in poetry which I was impressed by but that's but that's not where you're going you see yourself as a storyteller of one kind or another a storyteller in generator yeah for sure and and I think I've also been interested so much in the middle grade and young adult and children literature side so to write a children's book as my first book was just really special and do you want to continue doing that and you want to continue addressing kids yeah I think so I think I could also see myself doing non-fiction writing and like narrative style for adults as well okay and now a day in the life of the vice-president did they did they ask you to do this or did you just decide really oh yeah we so um we had an Instagram account for Marlin and right after the inauguration the day after we were like we have to get this handle of Marlin bundo so if someone took it on Twitter so you're like we have to go the Instagram and we did it and he just got pretty popular in Instagram and my mom and I had talked about we should write a book for him and we were literally sitting on the couch one day in our house and in the Naval Observatory and started brainstorming ideas and I you know I kind of said well what if he was on the campaign trail or what if he did this and my mom I remember pull out her phones started taking notes we thought the first one really had to be about the vice presidency to kind of introduce them to the world especially she's only the first Marlin okay and so yeah so I think my mom also being illustrator and she illustrated the book was able to tell me you know I I know I can paint this scene so let's let's do a scene the stands of that and so we really worked on it together she's really good I mean I should have mentioned that your mother illustrated the book and it's really nice I mean I'm really different than she always done that yeah yeah she's been a watercolor artist my whole life she um she had a business for it for a while and she's our teacher um she's just very very talented no I noticed I don't want to get too political on you but I noticed the book is published by Regnery which is a famous conservative publisher and I think they do they do great work they're amazing the the world of children's publishing is another world this has been very insular for a very long time yeah it is that it do you think that that's gonna be a problem for you in the future is you think that that's it's gonna be tough for you to speak to children through that get through that wall I would hope not yeah um I would hope not because I think that I mean especially with this book too um I think it gave me a place where we come together and I think that I think it should be I mean I think that you don't have to have something that's overtly political um in a book or overtly not political in a book for children to pick up on it and to learn something from it so I think I would hope that it it wouldn't be but I think that we're moving in a direction where it won't be yeah I mean but it's not a political book it's really just a nice job yeah and so what else is Marlon bundle going to do I don't know I mean we're we're excited and we're seeing you know I don't know about other adventures might be going on in the future but for this for the main part right now he's out there I cannot believe it is just rabbit allowed in the White House he's been who is the rabbit has been in the way yes yes he went to a military family event did he really yeah my mom brought him and kids just they just loved him there's absolute love and he's really nice to not all rabbits are really nice but I can brag on him and talk about how he's very friendly very Marlon Brando yes yes how do you get from Marlon Brando to Marlon bundle that's so actually it's funny story when I got him for a student film project um my friends and I were looking for a rabbit and it was it was a stripper I'd written yeah and there was a rabbit in it people said you know change it take the rabbit out and I was like no really needs to have the rabbit um and so so we ended up going on Craigslist and the Craigslist owner said make me an offer and so it became ask odd father joke that we had to make him an offer and so my friend who loves marlon brando said we have to name Marlon Brando and I said we have to name him Marlon bundo the true story of Marlon bundo a day in the life of the president by Charlotte pence and illustrated by Karen pence who looks exactly like you for some reason yes you're probably related I don't blame you could think thank you very much for coming on Charlie good luck with the book I hope it does really well thank you thank you for having me nice like you wow what a well raised first and a fan of another kingdom the most important thing that you know I have to I have to relate she's a family thing all right stuff I like my wife hates that stop using so I saw two underrated films in the last week or so that I thought got just kind of just ignored one was red Sparrow now I went to red Sparrow because speaking of my wife she was out of town and I heard there Jennifer Lawrence did a nude scene in it she does it's great it is absolutely it's one of the great it's just a absolute great but you know it did its thing a long time ago I can't remember how long it was George Clooney was in a film called Solaris and the film was lousy and they knew it so they started advertising the fact that at one point his butt was in the movie and nope it didn't matter nobody went and one of my brothers said to me they don't understand that like if women are watching a movie they like and George Clooney's butt isn't it that's kind of interesting but if men hear that some actress they like is gonna do a nude scene they will cancel their vacations however all that aside it actually was it's like all movies now it's too long I'm the one federal law I would support is a movie a law that says movies cannot be over two hours long or you have to go wash my car that would be that would just be one one federal law is important it's it's two hours and 20 minutes it's too long but it's actually a good story it has people in it it has you know and it has a really interesting character played by Jennifer Lawrence who is this ballerina who gets injured in the first scene and for reasons that I won't go into she gets recruited to be a spy for the Russians and which is not a good experience I mean it means that you have to use your body and it has to you know you have to be cold cool seductress to do what she does and she's a really good character and well played the reviewers ran the movie down because they said it was sexually exploitative it is and I enjoyed every minute of it but it's but what I really liked about it was it actually has characters who do you trust you know the actual real questions that come up in life but told is a big spy story who do you trust what can you what can you count on what's the right thing to do the other film I saw is the foreigner which is also based on a novel called the Chinaman this is more of an action movie but what it's this story is this the IRA sets off a bomb in London a young girl is killed she's the daughter of an old Chinese immigrant right 60 year old guy and the 60 year old guy starts looking for answers the only thing about him is he's Jackie Chan and he you know he's obviously a guy with skills and once they throw him out and say you know get out of here we have no answers he comes back on them here is Pierce Brosnan plays one of the IRA guys and here's the scene where Jackie Chan confronts him Oh give me the names but I don't know who they really are I'm doing everything I can to find out who's responsible you're lying who kill my daughter I'm sorry I truly don't know yet Pierce Brosnan is great in this and he plays basically Gerry Adams he plays this IRA a guy who has gone legit and he's getting pressure from both the old IRA who want to keep bombing people and from the Brits who want him to straighten up and fly right and what makes the movie work is that Jackie Chan only peers in it from time to time because it's these things are based on novels they actually better plots so he only appears in it from time to time and the rest of the story is about this political drama that's going on and it really is fun I like shoot-'em-ups so you know if you don't like shoot-'em-ups you might not like it but I think it's really much better than I expected it to be in a really good one which brings me to just this one point I know I'm always picking on superhero movies but this is not my only point about this is spy movies movies like this have big ideas in them they have politics in them I believe that the guy who wrote red Sparrow is one of us a conservative and the reason I believe it is he has quotes on his book from Vince Flynn and Nelson DeMille who I know are more on the right wing and so it just has a sense of like how you become what John McCrae said you you have to be a disgusted Patriot and John the Caray who I thought was the one of the truly best novelists of the Cold War really understood the complexities of defending your country in ways that are not always savory so to be a spy to be a CIA torture like the lady was about to take over the CIA everybody saying oh she used waterboarding on terrorists now I feel that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if it prevents terrorist attacks but it is degrading to the person doing it as well as to the person it's being done by and the complexities of life the fact that you have to do bad things in life the fact that you have to do bad things to defend good things these are all the things that make you a grown-up understanding this and I think it helps to have art that dramatizes these things that people have to sometimes get their hands dirty otherwise you remain a child and if you remain a child you will get on CNN and be interviewed about complex issues because their children as well but I think these movies spy movies are so often a really good political vehicle for discussing that the fact that even in in in politics even the people were in the right sometimes have to be in the wrong really good movies red Sparrow really enjoyable of the foreigner both very enjoyable not not great films but both really enjoyable if you want to sample some Gianluca ray and you never have you should either read Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy because he's a wonderful wonderful writer until the Berlin Wall falls down and then he becomes simplistic as well but while he's dealing with the vagaries and complexities of the Soviet Union he was a great novelist Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was made I know was made into a movie recently and I know I have friends who worked on that movie but the really great one is the old 1979 miniseries made by the BBC with Alec Guinness his performance as smiley is so great that John McCrae said he would never write another smiley book because he couldn't get Alec Guinness out of his mind and he was different than the guy in the book but Alec and it's one of the greatest actors of his generation most people know him because he was obi-wan Kenobi but he had a whole beautiful and fantastic career before that all right the Clavin this weekend now begins I know it's sad but you too like Charlotte pence could become another Kingdom
