1
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,290
We often see airstrikes and
missile launches this way:

2
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,930
miles away from their
targets, or overhead

3
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,750
but through a distant
lens,

4
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,840
or maybe just from 
a safe proximity.

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,660
We see the “awe” but
rarely feel the “shock.”

6
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,540
Because the Syrian conflict has
been so thoroughly documented

7
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,890
in video,

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,020
we now have another
perspective:

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,620
what it’s like to
experience that shock.

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,320
A single person on
the ground, targeted

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,950
by something that
can move faster,

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,880
see better and hit harder.

13
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,710
Moving just a short distance
can save your life.

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,989
There’s often silence. 
No warning.

15
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,460
Sometimes there’s
little else to do

16
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,140
but wait.

17
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:55,408
Other times the only
thing to do is run —

18
00:01:57,938 --> 00:02:00,778
even when what you’re running
from can travel faster

19
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:01,790
than the speed of sound.

20
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,600
This was said to show
an American airstrike

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,690
on Syrian regime
forces last year.

22
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,370
The technology directing
these weapons

23
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,625
means you can be close to impact
and yet unharmed.

24
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,460
Islamic State said
this was a U.S. airstrike.

25
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,600
Yes, many times weapons
come from far away.

26
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,665
But sometimes the
warning is clear.

27
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,280
This was a Russian
cruise missile

28
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,800
over Syria several years ago:

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,370
a rare glimpse of a high tech
aerial attack in transit.

30
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,005
Of course, these are all
brief moments of impact.

31
00:03:01,890 --> 00:00:00,000
The aftermaths go on.
