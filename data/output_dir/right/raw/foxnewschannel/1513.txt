1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:02,160
SENATOR MANCHIN AND A LOT OF

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,696
DEMOCRATS IN THE MINING FIELDS

3
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:07,298
WHERE I'M VERY WELL-KNOWN AND

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,701
VERY WELL-REPORTED.

5
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:11,436
>> Neil: IF DON BLANKENSHIP HAS

6
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:13,738
HIS WAY, HE WILL RUN AS A

7
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:15,440
THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,776
A NUMBER OF VERY SAVVY LAWYERS

9
00:00:18,776 --> 00:00:19,444
INCLUDING JUDGE ANDREW

10
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:21,479
NAPOLITANO SAID THAT WOULDN'T

11
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:26,050
HOLD UP IN COURT AND BLANKENSHIP

12
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,952
COULD BE A THREAT TO THE

13
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:29,487
REPUBLICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL.

14
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,255
THAT WOULD MEAN YOU WOULD BE

15
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:32,122
DIVIDING THE REPUBLICAN VOTE.

16
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:34,992
HARD TO SAY BY HOW MUCH, IF IT'S

17
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,260
CONSEQUENTIAL AT ALL AND

18
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,029
POTENTIALLY HANDLING THAT SEAT

19
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:41,199
TO THE EMBATTLED SENATOR THAT IS

20
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:43,401
HOLDING THAT RIGHT NOW, JOE

21
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:43,735
MANCHIN.

22
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:45,536
A POTENTIAL PICKUP FOR

23
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:46,704
REPUBLICANS DOESN'T MATERIALIZE.

24
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:48,473
A GUY THAT WATCHES THIS CLOSELY

25
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:50,975
ON BEHALF OF HIS PARTY, A BIG

26
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:53,444
WIG LEADER THERE, JOHN THUNE.

27
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:55,012
SENATOR, GOOD TO HAVE YOU.

28
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:56,414
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, NEIL.

29
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:59,984
>> Neil: DOES THIS WORRY YOU,

30
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:02,420
SENATOR?

31
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,857
>> IN THE END, THE VOTERS WILL

32
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,159
DECIDE AND THEY DON'T WANT US

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,494
TELLING THEM WHAT THEY SHOULD

34
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:09,894
THINK.

35
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:13,498
CLEARLY IF YOU HAVE A ONE-ON-ONE

36
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:15,199
MATCHUP BETWEEN A VERY SOLID

37
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:18,236
REPUBLICAN CHOICE WHO WON THE

38
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:20,571
PRIMARY, PATRICK MORRISEY AND

39
00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:23,341
JOE MANCHIN, PROBABLY PRESENTS

40
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:25,410
THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR PATRICK

41
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,078
MORRISEY TO WIN OF THE THIRD

42
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:28,146
PARTY CANDIDATES TEND TO SPLIT

43
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:30,615
UP THE VOTE.

44
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:31,749
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

45
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:35,119
IT'S HARD TO PREDICT AT THIS

46
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:35,420
POINT.

47
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,088
IT'S A SEAT IN PLAY.

48
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:38,356
WE HAVE A GOOD CANDIDATE THAT

49
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:39,991
CAME OUT OF THE PROCESS.

50
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:41,559
THE VOTERS SELECTED HIM AND

51
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,395
WE'RE PREPARING FOR A SPIRITED

52
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,296
FALL CAMPAIGN.

53
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:46,631
>> Neil: YOU CORRECTLY POINTED

54
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:48,132
OUT THAT IT'S UP TO WEST

55
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:51,402
VIRGINIA TO DECIDE THIS.

56
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:56,441
REMEMBER TALKING TO BLANKENSHIP

57
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:58,009
A COUPLES TIMES, HE WAS ANGRY AT

58
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:58,643
MITCH McCONNELL AND THE

59
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:00,645
REPUBLICAN PARTY MAKING IT CLEAR

60
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:02,113
HE WAS NOT THEIR GUY.

61
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:04,415
IN FACT, TARGETING HIM AS

62
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,651
SOMEONE THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER

63
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:07,885
EVER VOTE FOR.

64
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:12,557
YOU THINK -- AS A PARTY NOT

65
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:15,193
TRIED SO HARD, MITCH McCONNELL

66
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:17,328
NOT TRIED SO HARD TO TARGET HIM,

67
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:20,565
YOU WOULDN'T BE IN THIS

68
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:20,965
PREDICAMENT?

69
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:23,201
>> IF BLANKENSHIP CAME OUT OF

70
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:24,902
THAT PRIMARY, YOU COULD HAND IT

71
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:25,803
TO THE DEMOCRATS.

72
00:02:25,803 --> 00:02:27,538
THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR

73
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:29,106
REPUBLICAN PROSPECTS IN WEST

74
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:29,474
VIRGINIA.

75
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:31,075
THE LEADER RECOGNIZES IN ORDER

76
00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:32,877
FOR US TO HAVE A SHOT AT

77
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:33,911
MAINTAINING AND HOPEFULLY

78
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:35,813
GROWING OUR MAJORITY IN THE

79
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:36,814
UNITED STATES SENATE, YOU HAVE

80
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:39,717
TO GET ELECTABLE CANDIDATES ON

81
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:40,685
THE BALLOT.

82
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:43,621
WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SOMEONE THAT

83
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,556
IS ELECTABLE AROUND THE COUNTRY

84
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:47,592
AND THE OTHER STATES WHICH OPENS

85
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:51,896
UP THE MAP FOR SERIOUS

86
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:53,998
OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO EXPAND

87
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:55,199
OUR MAJORITY.

88
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,301
WE HAVE A LOT OF SUCCESS

89
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,169
ALREADY.

90
00:02:58,169 --> 00:02:59,537
WE'LL SENDS THREE BILLS TO THE

91
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:01,239
PRESIDENT TODAY THAT CAME OUT OF

92
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:02,773
THE HOUSE AND SENATE.

93
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,742
IF YOU WANT TO SEE MORE PROGRESS

94
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:06,544
AND BIGGER THINGS GET DONE, GROW

95
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:09,180
AND EXPAND OUR MAJORITIES HERE

96
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,814
IN THE CONGRESS.

97
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,349
>> Neil: THE SENATE LOOKS

98
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:12,450
PROMISES IN THAT RECORD.

99
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,118
MAYBE LESS SO THE HOUSE.

100
00:03:14,118 --> 00:03:15,920
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

101
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,255
THE WINDS SEEM TO SHIFT A LITTLE

102
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:17,522
BIT.

103
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:20,992
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS, SENATOR,

104
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:25,796
COMES THIS SO-CALLED SPYGATE.

105
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,498
THERE WERE OPERATIVES LOOKING AT

106
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:31,269
HIS CAMPAIGN IN THE FALL OF 2016

107
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:32,770
DATING BACK TO THE SPRING.

108
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,006
AND THEY WERE FISHING AROUND FOR

109
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:35,706
SOMETHING.

110
00:03:35,706 --> 00:03:37,174
PRESUMABLY ANY RUSSIAN ACTIVITY.

111
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:38,876
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT AND

112
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:40,311
CALLS BY MANY IN YOUR PARTY THAT

113
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:43,414
SAY GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR ON

114
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:43,714
THIS?

115
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:47,251
>> I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF ANOTHER

116
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:48,219
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND ANOTHER

117
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,520
YEARS LONG INVESTIGATION.

118
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,557
I DO THINK IT NEEDS TO BE

119
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:53,424
INVESTIGATED AND LOOKED INTO

120
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:53,791
ALREADY.

121
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:57,194
YOU KNOW, CLEARLY IF THERE WAS

122
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:59,830
DABBLING OR ATTEMPTS BY THE NBA,

123
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,898
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO

124
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:02,400
STEP ON THE SCALES IN A

125
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,468
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OR TO HAVE

126
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:07,204
SOME SPY EMBEDDED IN THE TRUMP

127
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:08,773
CAMPAIGN, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

128
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:10,141
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW

129
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:11,576
AND WE NEED TO KNOW.

130
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:13,177
IT'S VERY LEGITIMATE AND VALID

131
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:15,880
TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO GET TO

132
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,982
THE BOTTOM OF IT AND INVESTIGATE

133
00:04:17,982 --> 00:04:18,249
IT.

134
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:19,517
THE CALLS INSPECTOR A SPECIAL

135
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:20,750
COUNSEL TO ME, I DON'T THINK AT

136
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,220
THIS POINT THAT WE WANT TO GO

137
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,589
DOWN THE ROAD OF ANOTHER FULL

138
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:26,057
BLOWN, YOU KNOW, INVESTIGATION

139
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,092
LIKE THAT THAT COULD RUN ON FOR

140
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:29,160
MONTHS AND MAYBE YEARS.

141
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,761
>> Neil: I THINK WE'RE RUNNING

142
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:31,462
OUT OF LAWYERS.

143
00:04:31,462 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
