1
00:00:06,693 --> 00:00:07,726
ROB: ALL RIGHT, ALL EYES REMAIN

2
00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:09,528
ON PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO NOW HEADS

3
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:11,330
TO BRUSSELS LATER TODAY WHERE HE

4
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:13,198
WILL COME FACE TO FACE WITH NATO

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,334
LEADERS AFTER PUTTING THEM ON

6
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:15,734
NOTICE.

7
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:17,136
>> I WILL SEE NATO AND I'M GOING

8
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:19,138
TELL NATO, YOU HAVE TO START

9
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:20,172
PAYING BILLS.

10
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:21,307
THE UNITED STATES IS NOT GOING

11
00:00:21,308 --> 00:00:23,943
TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

12
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:25,811
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

13
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:27,980
CARLEY: SO IS THE PRESIDENT

14
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:31,250
RIGHT NOW, JOINING US UK FORMER

15
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,252
LEADER NIGEL FARAGE, THANK YOU

16
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:34,753
SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US THIS

17
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:36,922
MORNING FROM SUNNY BERMUDA TO

18
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:38,123
SAY THE LEAST.

19
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:39,191
ROB: NICE.

20
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:43,829
GET THEM TO COUGH UP MORE MONEY

21
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,699
ON DEFENSE SPENDING, WHY DO YOU

22
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,833
THINK THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT TO

23
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:49,234
BE TOUGH ON THE ISSUE?

24
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:50,369
>> THE PRESIDENT IS NOT BEING

25
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,437
TOUGH ON THE ISSUE, THE

26
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:57,710
NATO YOU HAVE TO SPEND 2% OF

27
00:00:57,711 --> 00:00:58,811
YOUR GDP ON DEFENSE.

28
00:00:58,812 --> 00:01:00,980
THE FACT IS THERE ARE 29 MEMBERS

29
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:02,915
OF MEMBERS AND ONLY SIX OF THEM

30
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:07,886
ARE ACTUALLY PAYING THE

31
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:08,654
MEMBERSHIP FEE, SO THE ARGUMENT

32
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:09,355
IS, WHY SHOULD AMERICA PROTECT

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,526
I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE

34
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:16,562
ARGUMENT BUT IT'S AGAINST

35
00:01:27,374 --> 00:01:28,974
HAVE TO PAY 1ER.

36
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:30,909
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR IN THE

37
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,344
NEXT 48 HOURS ARE VARIOUS

38
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:35,347
EUROPEAN LEADERS SAYING TRUMP IS

39
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:36,281
THREATENING THE SECURITY OF

40
00:01:36,282 --> 00:01:38,450
PEOPLE IN EUROPE, THE TRUTH IS

41
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:40,386
IT'S THE AMBITIONS OF THE

42
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:42,388
EUROPEAN PROJECT THAT'S DOING IT

43
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:43,322
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT

44
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:45,924
SHOULD BE VERY FIRM, INDEED.

45
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:47,326
ROB: IT'S CRAZY WHEN YOU LOOK AT

46
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:48,293
THE NUMBERS BECAUSE YOU SEE THE

47
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:49,595
UNITED STATES AT ABOUT 3 AND A

48
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:51,730
HALF PERCENT, YOU GUYS HIT THE

49
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:55,200
MARKET AT 2.12, WE BOTH HAVE BIG

50
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:56,935
ECONOMY, WE ARE TALKING ON A BIG

51
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:58,570
SCALE, 3 AND A HALF AND 2%, YOU

52
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:00,139
HAVE SMALLER COUNTRIES WHO ARE

53
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,640
GETTING THE DEAL OF A LIFETIME

54
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:04,109
PAYING MAYBE 1% OF A VERY TINNY

55
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,378
GDP TO JOIN A CLUB THAT GETS YOU

56
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,113
THE BACKING OF MILITARIES THAT

57
00:02:08,114 --> 00:02:09,848
ARE WORTH TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS,

58
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:11,216
I MEAN, WHAT A SWEET DEAL AND

59
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:12,584
HOW COULD ANYBODY NOT CALL THEM

60
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:14,820
OUT IS WHAT I'M SAYING?

61
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:16,755
>> YEAH, NO, ABSOLUTELY.

62
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:18,390
IT'S FREE LOADING, ISN'T IT?

63
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:24,329
IT'S NOT JUST SMALL EUROPEAN

64
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:26,465
BIGGEST COUNTRY IN EUROPE AND

65
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:28,500
GERMANY IS ONLY PAYING 1.2% AND

66
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,369
I THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

67
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,804
ANGELA MERKEL NEED TO HAVE A

68
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:33,372
VERY FRANK DISCUSSION ABOUT

69
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:35,374
THAT, OTHERWISE AS I SAY,

70
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,976
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE FREE

71
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:45,150
ISN'T GOING TO RUFFLE ANY

72
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:46,652
FEATHERS AT THE MEETING BECAUSE

73
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:48,687
HE'S MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN

74
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:53,425
>> WELL, LOOK, YOU KNOW, THE

75
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,297
LIKE PUTIN OR NOT, THE WHOLE

76
00:02:58,298 --> 00:03:00,199
POINT ABOUT TRUMP STRATEGY IS

77
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,267
YOU GO OUT THERE AND MEET

78
00:03:05,138 --> 00:03:06,972
RELATIONSHIP AND THAT MAKES

79
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:07,606
THINGS BETTER.

80
00:03:07,607 --> 00:03:09,741
I -- THE THERE ARE MANY EUROPE,

81
00:03:13,513 --> 00:03:15,781
ABOUT PUTIN AND ABOUT RUSSIA.

82
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:17,850
I THINK THE TRUTH OF IT IS IT'S

83
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:20,419
THE UKRAINE, IT'S THE WHOLE

84
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,121
ISSUE OF THE UKRAINE AND CRIMEA

85
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:24,756
THAT LED TO SUCH DETERIORATION

86
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:27,159
OF CONDITIONS BUT DO I THINK THE

87
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,293
ONE THING THAT THE PRESIDENT

88
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:30,696
NEEDS TO DO IS HE NEEDS TO GET A

89
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:32,731
PUBLIC ASSURANCE FROM PUTIN THAT

90
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:35,134
RUSSIA WILL NOT MEDDLE IN

91
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:42,107
AND THAT, I THINK, IS VERY

92
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:42,474
IMPORTANT.

93
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:42,975
ROB: ABSOLUTELY.

94
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,642
EVERYBODY LOOKING FOR THAT.

95
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:44,943
GOING TO YOUR COUNTRY, TURMOIL

96
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:48,280
IN ENGLAND AS A COUPLE OF

97
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:50,749
BREXITERS, BORIS JOHNSON QUIT

98
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,117
YESTERDAY AND NOW EVERYBODY IS

99
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:05,564
WORKS AND WHY THERESA MAY IS AT

100
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,540
REMAINING SIDE.

101
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,807
THAT WAS ADD CHOICE TO BECOME

102
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,209
THE PRIME MINISTER, SHE PROMISED

103
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:25,384
CABINET ON FRIDAY FRANKLY

104
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:27,319
AMOUNTED TO A BETRAYAL OF MANY

105
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,221
OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN

106
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:31,623
PROMISED EVEN IN HER OWN GENERAL

107
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:34,493
MANIFESTO, SO THERE'S AN ISSUE

108
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:36,995
BORIS JOHNSON AND DAVID DAVIS

109
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:38,263
HAVE RESIGNED.

110
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:39,831
I BELIEVE THEY ARE RIGHT TO DO

111
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:41,700
SO AND I'M NOW AS THE VIEW THAT

112
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:44,136
IF SHE STAYS PRIME MINISTER, WE

113
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:46,371
WILL NOT GET THE BREXIT WE VOTED

114
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:47,739
FOR AND NOT BE ABLE TO SIGN

115
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,174
TRADE DEAL WITH AMERICA AND

116
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:50,576
OTHER BIG COUNTRIES AROUND THE

117
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:58,183
WORLD AND WHAT IT NOW NEEDS 48

118
00:04:58,184 --> 00:04:58,784
CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF

119
00:04:58,785 --> 00:04:59,585
PARLIAMENT TO SIGN A LETTER OF

120
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:00,252
NO CONFIDENCE AND THAT WOULD

121
00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:05,190
WHETHER SHE CAN CONTINUE OR NOT.

122
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:07,559
MY GUESS, RIGHT NOW MY GUESS IS

123
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,262
THAT THE TIDE IS NOW MOVING

124
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:13,432
AGAINST HER AND I THINK, LITTLE

125
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:14,700
CHANCE THAT SHE WILL SURVIVE

126
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:17,236
MORE THAN A FEW WEEKS.

127
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:18,537
ROB: THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD WANT,

128
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:20,172
YOU WOULD LOVE HER OUT.

129
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,444
THE BRITISH PUBLIC OVER BREXIT

130
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:26,845
AND I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I

131
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:28,413
THINK SHE'S THE WORST PRIME

132
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:31,250
MINISTER WE'VE HAD IN MY ENTIRE

133
00:05:31,251 --> 00:05:31,617
LIFETIME.

134
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:32,618
CARLEY: AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO

135
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:34,419
HEADING TO LONDON VERY SOON.

136
00:05:34,420 --> 00:00:00,000
HE'S GOING TO BE HEADING THERE
