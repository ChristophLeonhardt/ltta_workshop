“What happens at
Georgetown Prep,
stays at Georgetown Prep.”
This is how Judge
Brett Kavanaugh
described his high school days
and his college adventures.
“What happens on the
bus, stays on the bus.”
But it’s a saying
you’ve probably heard before.
“What happens here—”
“What happens in Mexico—”
“What happened in Cairo—”
“What happens in accounting—”
“—stays at the Oscars, O.K.?”
Its meaning comes
from what it doesn’t say.
And more often than not,
it’s a nudge, nudge,
wink, wink to a boys' club
code of conduct.
“It continues to have a
male connotation
that men do things —
or at least talk about things —
when women are not around.”
“You know it’s right in
line with:
‘I don’t kiss and tell,’
‘Boys will be boys.’”
“It’s a linguistic strategy
that provides a ready-made 
practically nursery
rhyme-ready excuse for
men’s misbehaviors
that almost suggests before
the behaviors are even called out
that the behavior should
go without consequence.”
These days the phrase isn’t
used exclusively by men,
but linguists say
it likely emerged
in the second half
of the 20th century
in male-dominated spaces,
like sports clubs,
and rock bands.
It later became popular
among spring breakers.
“Dude says he’s going
to murder these other guys.”
Eventually, it
entered Americans'
everyday vocabulary,
when a self-proclaimed
Sin City
adopted it as its
official slogan.
“What happens in Vegas—”
“What happens in Vegas—”
“What happens in Vegas—”
“—stays in Vegas.”
“Within the logic
of this ad campaign,
not having a story
to share,
doesn’t mean you didn’t have
this extraordinary time.
It just means that
the story you do have
needs to be silenced because
of the social rules
that you had to break
to get it.”
“You gotta think of me
as your life coach.”
The phrase can
refer to anything
from drinking and partying—
“Listen to him.”
to lying and womanizing—
“I am a brain doctor.
I’m a lifeguard.
I’m a race car driver.”
“You told my friend
you’re a lawyer.”
to sexual experimentation —
“You gentlemen
ready to check in?”
or perhaps more
unspeakable things.
“Is this about Vegas?”
“Vegas?”
“You scared me for a second.”
But the connotation
stays the same.
Men behave badly when
their mothers or wives
aren’t looking.
It’s a trope of
masculinity that
runs deep, from fraternities
to Wall Street.
Being one of the guys takes
the ability and willingness
to keep secrets.
So while what happens
here stays here
has become a rallying
cry for wild weekends,
it also suggests that reckless
or aggressive behavior is O.K.,
as long as men stick together.
