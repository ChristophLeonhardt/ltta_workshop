Russia will hold its elections on March 18th of 2018 and Vladimir Putin who is the current president of Russia is planning on getting ahead of possible foreign agents who tried to meddle in the country's elections now he has called for a new foreign agents law which essentially would force social media companies or any type of media company that has any type of exposure in Russia to be deemed worthy of investigation and if there is any foreign player involved in that company then they have to list themselves as a foreign agent now here's what he had to say while he was talking to leaders in Russia's Parliament he says that we need to look carefully at how some companies work in Internet in social media and how widely they are involved in our domestic political life it should be carefully analyzed how they are operating and will be operating during the presidential election now anyone who hears that statement might say you know what ok that's reasonable you don't want foreign countries to meddle in elections we're very much concerned about Russia meddling in our elections but you also have to take into account how latter Mir Putin operates in Russia remember that the last time he was re-elected was in 2011 and there were mass protests because there's no real election it's already predetermined that he is gonna be the winner and I'll tell you how and right now there is someone who's trying to challenge him in the election and they're preventing him from being able to run and I'll tell you that in just a second but Jake jump jump in yeah so look I think the u.s. going a little too far in in going after Russian media outlets so RT is a mixed bag Sputnik definitely does just pure propaganda for Putin and the Russian oligarchs but I don't like okay so they do propaganda and and Al Jazeera's owned by Qatar and bbc's owned by the British and CNN is largely owned by the establishment here in the US and so and MSNBC is owned by Comcast everybody serves someone right and that's why I think independent media is important so I think we overdo it he's trying to go oh yeah then I'm going to target you guys yeah and and so but he has the same kind of disingenuous reaction as a lot of the right-wing here do like oh my golly gee I hear there's 'gambling in this establishment people are trying to meddle in elections and and it's an obvious strike back and it's totally disingenuous yeah I really like our master graphic I feel like it's very smart it's clever yeah anyway so let me tell you a little bit about someone who is attempting to challenge him in the election and how he is being stopped his name is Alexei Navalny and he has been a very outspoken opponent of Vladimir Putin despite the fact that some of his friends who were also opponents were murdered while they were protesting Putin after the 2011 election now Navalny has been drawing a lot of attention to the oligarchs in Russia and also Russian corruption and he was punished for doing so by facing these trumped-up criminal charges involving embezzlement so let me give you the details about that Navalny has been repeatedly dragged into court on charges of fraud and embezzlement in the summer of 2013 though he was sentenced to a five-year prison term which was changed to a suspended sentence when thousands of people again took to the streets risking arrest at the end of 2014 Navalny was sentenced to house arrest and his brother was imprisoned in effect taken hostage now Navalny did not fight these charges he went to the courts the European courts to fight and he appealed all of his convictions to the European Court on human rights where he has won every single time most recently the European Court labelled Navalny x' 2014 conviction and sentence is arbitrary so in Russia though he's still considered a convicted criminal which prevents him from running against Vladimir Putin so anytime there's opposition against Putin someone is either exiled they emigrate to another country or there mysteriously murdered or they have to face these weird random criminal charges when they haven't really there's no proof that they've actually done anything wrong so every country has its elites and and a lot of them try to find different ways to give you false choices by the time you're voting in the election so some are more sophisticated some are very blatant so in Iran it's the mullahs you can't run for president unless you've gotten approval from the mullahs that means the Iranian people have false choices so it's you know a really conservative guy approved by the mullahs or kind of a moderate but in reality super right-winger also approved by the mullahs in China it's the Communists committees that decide who will be allowed to run and who won't they took Hong Kong back in Hong Kong lost their democracy all of a sudden they got two Chinese Communist government approved candidates and they're like what what you slug democracy now vote for the two guys we really really like and will control your lives so here in America our elites are the donors and they're a tiny tiny fraction of of America arguably a smaller fraction no definitely I saw Larry Lessig did a presentation on this a smaller fraction than the Communist committees in in China as a percentage of the population so our donors get to decide who are false choices are and then in a general election everybody yells at you and says no no you have to vote for the less monstrous person and that's true I would vote for the less monstrous one but that's why primaries are so important that's why now small donors I think are making a big difference in appending this system and why we got to get money out but but we do have false choice here in America too but in Russia it's it's more brazen and it's more of a sham you literally can't go on the ballot unless Putin approves it you can't you can't have anything aired on on television in Russia unless Putin approves it so what kind of a sham election is it I mean Saddam Hussein would be slightly embarrassed and had how fake these elections are so putting I will decide who is voting against me you schmuck of the earth you you are being strong you're not allowed on the ballot no but you're you're absolutely right about that because they will literally reach out to people that they want to run against Putin to make it appear as if there is some sort of option there for the voters and it's just why in 2011 there were so many protests right look I'm not I'm not talking about Russia in the context of what happened in this past election in the United States right this is completely separate I just want to remind all the people who are vociferously defending Russia because of their hatred for Hillary Clinton that Russia has its issues because of Putin Putin is a terrible person he's murdered journalists he's murdered opponents okay he's the one who was behind all of the anti-gay laws that passed in 2012 he's a bad guy and so for those who are trying to like make excuses for him and make it seem as though Russia's hunky-dory and you know politicians in the United States are just making it seem like things are bad there no no things are bad there okay so by the way just to give you a sense of in in 2012 three people try to run against them Navalny Nemtsov and Kasparov no not allowed Kasparov has now been exiled out of the country Nemtsov was killed in 2015 jaren wonder how that happened then Navalny has been in prison wrongfully so according to the European Court of Human Rights and is now being banned so you speak out against Putin not only do you not go on television you could you easily wind up six feet under you try to oppose him eventually they had another Russian oligarch run against Putin in that election and Putin got 63% of the vote when you rigged the election and you have no competition and you only get 63% it's you know it said I've got a higher percent and percentage of that let's be absolutely clear there is no real elections in Russia there is no democracy in Russia Putin is that not the President of Russia he's the dictator of Russia you just watch
