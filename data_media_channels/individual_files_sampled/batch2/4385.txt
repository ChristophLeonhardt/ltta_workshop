or viewers what happened yesterday in a party line vote House Republicans passed a non-binding measure demanding the Justice Department produce sensitive documents about the Russia investigation within the next seven days with some threatening to impeach Deputy Attorney General at the straight they they they want the FBI in the Justice Department to release sensitive documents about an ongoing investigation against Russia I think that says just about everything you need to know about how one inch they are well here's a little more alongside FBI director Christopher Rea Rosenstein appeared before the House Judiciary Committee yesterday where Republican lawmakers berated him with accusations mr. Rosenstein why are you keeping information from Congress person I'm not keeping any information from Congress that it's approved a few minutes mr. Rosen Stein think the House of Representatives going to say something different I don't agree with you congressman I don't believe that's what they're going to say and if they do they'll might disagree but I think I mean I think and I wonder why you won't give us what we've asked for sir I certainly hope that your colleagues are not under that impression that is not accurate sir it is accurate we have caught you high discrimination sir let make this one point that make this one point in sir where we've clients hiding information or statement that I'm personally keeping information from you trying to conceal information here at the boss mr. rose is dying that's correct and my job is to make sure that we respond to your concerns we have sir now I've appointed mr. louse who is managing that production and my understanding is it's actually going very well sir but your use of this to attack me prided you son wrong mr. chair made the witness be permitted it not it's not personal I appreciate your service it's not personal we just want the information which is true and I appreciate your saying isn't personal sometimes it feels that way being a former felony state judge if I had somebody like you come before me and now it was not me later that's that the god that signed and approved an application for a warrant had not even read the application that would allow spying on some honey truck would look at everything he signed from then on with a jaundiced eye and I'm telling you I was a little concerned about this Ben's plane sir well it you have you've said no I have not mr. Rosenstein did you threaten staffers on the House Intelligence Committee media reports indicate you did media reports are mistaken sometimes but this is what they said having the nation's number-one law enforcement officer threatened to subpoena your calls and emails is downright chilling did you threaten to subpoena their calls and emails no sir and there's no way to subpoena phone calls well I mean I'm just saying Susan you just wonder why these Republicans are so unhinged I know Donald Trump's unhinged I know that he sends out unhinged all cap tweets all the time but if you saw the testimony if you listened to the testimony rod roast the Stein time and time again they were mischaracterizing everything that had happened in that investigation and all they would do is they were unhinged and they were yelling at him and they were making accusations that were false and then when he finally got a chance to speak he would say exactly what had happened and that is exactly what's happening inside there any fair reading of the facts show that there that he's doing a straight job so why why why would the Republicans so unhinged and I think crazy yesterday the only thing I can think is they think it's a casting call I think they're auditioning for Donald Trump or another gig after they're done with their their like their role in Congress and I won't say that when they're done with their public service because if you want to see what public servants look at rod Rosen Stein look at director ray these are people who serve their into their country with integrity what we saw yesterday was so disrespectful to the American public not to those just those gentlemen but to all of us as Americans they don't care about finding what's gone with the truth all they want to do is get their name and their face on TV and that and maybe please Donald Trump because they want to get something down the road but these people are these members of Congress are disgraceful well and you know gene they're playing this is what the kids in advertising called micro-targeting they're playing to a very small crowd I know I know there's some people on some hosts late at night on Fox News it sort of regurgitate this out but even Fox News as president is starting to send out memos and having meetings and that's happened here before in the past it's happened here like a decade ago where you know you had the president st. enough enough yeah you know there's some guardrails here but those people that were unhinge yesterday lying using their positions I gosh and I guess Susan's right I guess it's just casting calls for Donald Trump because yeah there there's this alternative reality where the only people that like what they were doing yesterday would be people that were brainwashed the small percentage of Americans not many Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin because they are trying to stop the investigation into how Vladimir's influence the 2016 election and how he's still trying to influence in 2018 election according to our CIA director according to director Coates according to Mike Pompeo according to all of the intelligence chiefs all of whom were appointed by Donald Trump yeah they're playing to an audience of one basically they're playing to two Donald Trump there in you know there were pretty safe districts but they rely on the support of Donald Trump or at least on his not attacking them in tweets and you know they're trying to deep-six this investigation that every professional intelligence official everybody who's at all objective has looked at so yeah it's a totally valid investigative we underlined the fact that these are not Obama officials that Vladimir Putin is trying to rig American democracy that these are all Intel officials who were appointed by Donald J Trump right right right they were appointed by Donald Trump they heart by that in the main Republicans life-long Republicans like Bob Muller and rod Rhodes and Stein and and and director Ray there they are not and all handling this in a partisan nature quite the contrary I think they have bent over backwards to try to do this investigation without sort of you know running afoul of the the egomaniac in the White House who is it was just crazed because of the way it implicates his campaign and you know and that's just where the chips fall we will get to the bottom of this I trust but it's it's just disgraceful that those officials had to go through that yesterday well it is disgraced good such good loyal Americans good Republicans loyal Republicans do you think when these Republicans came to work for a Republican administration they actually thought that they were going to be screamed and yelled at by unhinged people in their own party you know that's quite where a wider divide from the Republican Party that we all grew up in Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan's party and what happened yesterday to those 2 good Republican law-enforcement officers who were just treated Shapley thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube make sure you subscribe to stay up to date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4
