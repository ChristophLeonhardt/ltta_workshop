“Wind back the clock.”
“Wind back the clock.
Until you get
a universe born from
a black hole exploding.”
“We learn to listen.”
Stephen Hawking, one of
the greatest physicists of our time,
didn't let a rare motor neurone 
illness that bound him
to a wheelchair stop him
from roaming everywhere else.
Despite being told,
age 22, that he had only
a few years left to live,
he went on to live
for decades more,
his mind traveling 
through the cosmos,
making breakthroughs
in scientific theories
on black holes and relativity,
capturing the imagination
of millions around the world.
And he didn’t stop there.
“Don’t feel bad, Lisa.
Sometimes the
smartest of us can be
the most childish.”
“Even you?”
“No. Not me.”
He also broke through 
onto our screens and radios.
“You guys were never
even on Futurama.
I was on three times.”
With cameos on TV shows —
“You made an arithmetic 
mistake on page 2.”
— in advertisements
and in songs,
becoming a pop culture icon —
“If you are looking
for trouble, you found it.”
“Yeah, just try me, you ... ow!”
— displaying a wicked sense 
of humor as he went.
“It’s a little hard to read
your tone of voice.
When you say that, 
are you being sarcastic?”
“Yes.”
“I thought so.”
His familiar synthesized voice
graced Pink Floyd songs
and TV commercials.
“Mankind’s greatest achievements 
have come about by talking.”
“Seconds after the Big Bang,
called inflation,
in which the ... !”
He ran over rival physicists,
and had other celebrities
pandering to him
in comedy sketches.
“Time to find my new voice.”
“Surely it has to be me?
Listen to my voice.
It’s got a tinge of physics.”
He offered sound advice
to the next generation.
“What do you think is
the cosmological effect
of Zayn leaving
 One Direction?”
“Finally, a question about
something important.
My advice to any
heartbroken young girl
is to pay loads of attention to
the study of theoretical physics.”
And in 2014, his extraordinary
life was immortalized
in a film titled "The
Theory Of Everything."
“All the way back,
to see what happened
at the beginning of time itself.”
While Hawking may have
left planet Earth,
his many fans can be sure
that his legacy remains.
“I could have gone on and on.
Space, here I come.”
