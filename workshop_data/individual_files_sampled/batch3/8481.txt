♪ ♪ THAT IS INTERESTING. TO USE IT OR NOT TO USE IT. IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATING WITH OTHERS. GETTING BACK TO WHAT WE WILL DO. WE WILL EXERCISE OVERSIGHT TO THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. Martha: NANCY PELOSI HAD TO GET HER PLANS SHOULD VOTERS GIVE HER THAT GAVEL IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. EYEING DEMOCRATS AND ELIJAH CUMMINGS PERHAPS WOULD PROBABLY BE THE LEADERSHIP AND JUDICIARY ON OVERSIGHT RESPECTIVELY. JOINING ME NOW IS HOUSE REPUBLICAN AT JIM JORDAN, A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. BUT DEBBIE WITH US. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO WHAT SHE SAID THERE? YOU'VE OFTEN WIELDED SUBPOENA POWER AND WANTED TO USE THAT. I GUESS WE HAVE TO EXPECT THAT IF THE SHE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT, THE OPPOSITE WILL HAVE THAT AS WELL. I AM SURE THEY ARE GOING DO IT. I THINK IT'S POWER WE KNOW FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT WHAT THEY WILL TRY TO DO. THEY WILL TRY TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. THEY WILL TRY TO ABOLISH I.C.E AND SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. FROM AN INVESTIGATIVE STANDPOINT, THEY WILL TRY TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. THEY WILL TRY TO GET HIS TAX RETURN, INVESTIGATE ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS. IN MY MIND, MORE IMPORTANT IN THE INVESTIGATION THAT DEMOCRATS WILL START IF THEY GET CONTROL OF CONGRESS IS DOING THAT THEY WILL STOP. THAT IS THE FBI INVESTIGATION. THEY DID WHAT THEY DID COME AS WRONG AS THAT WAS. DRESSING IN OUR LOVE, MAKING IT LOOK LIKE IT WAS LEGITIMATE INTELLIGENCE AND TAKING IT TO A CIRCUIT COURT TO GET A WARRANT. HE THAT IS AS WRONG AS IT GETS. I THINK THEY WILL STOP THAT. TO ME THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE. THE BOTTOM LINE, I DON'T THINK THEY WILL WIN. I THINK WE WILL KEEP THE MAJORITY AND CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE. Martha: WE WILL SEE. HERE'S A FOX NEWS POLL THAT SHOWS WHAT ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT FOR THIS VOTE. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SURVEYED IN THIS POLL. YOU CAN SEE, IT'S A AT TE YOU CAN SEE, IT'S A AT TV YOU CAN SEE, IT'S A AT TR YOU CAN SEE, IT'S A AT TY YOU CAN SEE, IT'S A AT TB YOU CAN SEE, IT'S A AT TT YOU CAN SEE, IT'S A AT TO YOU CAN SEE, IT'S A AT TM IS THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION. WE UNDERSTAND THAT HE IS LIKELY TO WRAP THIS UP OR LIKELY TO COME FORWARD AS PERHAPS WITH HIS REPORT AFTER THE MIDTERM ELECTION. IF HE HAS DONE WITH IT, IS THERE ANY DOUBT IN YOUR MIND THAT IT WILL BE PICKED UP BY THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND CONTINUED PROBABLY THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE COURSE OF THE TERM PRESIDENCY? PROBABLY SELL. THEY WILL INVESTIGATE ALL KINDS OF THINGS IF THEY GET POWER. THEY HAVE TAKEN SOME OF THE MOST EXTREME POSITIONS I'VE EVER SEEN THE DEMOCRAT PARTY TAKEN AMERICAN HISTORY. YES, THEY WILL CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION. THAT UNDERSCORES WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT IN 14 DAYS REPUBLICANS KEEP THE MAJORITY. THEY APPLAUD KAEPERNICK WHEN HE DISRESPECTS THE FLAG, THEY EMBRACE MAXINE WATERS WHEN SHE SAYS GO OUT AND HARASS ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS THE PRESIDENT. THAT IS THE VISION THEY OFFER THE COUNTRY? AND OH BY THE WAY, TWO YEARS OF INVESTIGATIONS IF THEY WIN. FIRST IS THE AMAZING RECORD OF 21 MONTHS OF LEADERSHIP BY THE PRESIDENT, TAXES ARE CAUGHT, THE ECONOMY IS GOING AT 4.2%. LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT. HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO WIN.
