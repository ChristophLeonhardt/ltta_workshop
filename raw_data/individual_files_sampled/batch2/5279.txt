former first lady Laura Bush is out with an op-ed in the Washington Post writing in part quote I live in a border state I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries but this zero tolerance policy is cruel it is immoral and it breaks my heart our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores we're making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert outside of El Paso these images are eerily reminiscent of the japanese-american internment camps of World War two Americans pride ourselves on being a moral nation if we are truly that country then it is our obligation to reunite these detained children with their parents and to stop separating parents and children in the first place recently Coleen Kraft who has the American Academy of Pediatrics visited a shelter run by the US Office of refugee resettlement she reported that while there were beds toys crayons a playground and diaper changes the people working at the shelter had been instructed not to pick up or touch the children to comfort them imagine not being able to pick up a child who has not yet out of diapers so I had asked some folks in the media I tweeted directly at one host to think about this op-ed before you talk about anything but this policy not the people talking about the policy talk about the policy and tell us what you really think of it joining us now we have Democratic representatives bill Pascrell and her kingdra Jefferies yesterday they were part of a group of lawmakers who went to a detention facility in New Jersey for an unannounced inspection to speak with a silent asylum seekers who have been separated from their children love to hear what you heard from that point of view I start with a comedian well good morning it was you know heartbreaking emotional experience when we arrived took about an hour and a half before we were able to actually visit with the detainees notwithstanding the fact that we prior legal authorization from their attorneys and from these individuals themselves to meet with us but when we had the opportunity to finally engage with them it was seven members of Congress led by congressman Jerry Nadler including Billy Pascrell what was amazing about the experience is that these individuals had had young children in one cases one case a son who were ripped away from them five years old 7 years old 12 years old even though they had come to the border seeking political asylum because they had a credible fear of persecution back home so why did you why did you all decide to make this trip what well we decided to make the trip to see for ourselves let's let's go there yeah which we usually do where the first responders and we weren't shocked what we heard but when you're listening to it when you're hearing the emotion from the fathers on Father's Day yeah you know you have to sit back and you have to listen and you have to reach out and try to be of some comfort to the individual we feel very strongly about this and I want to reverse like that they the term the the term that they've used and that is zero tolerance we have zero tolerance for this I want you to know the seven of us so we're there zero tolerance we're gonna use that term over and over again we cannot allow this thing to go on the Academy of Pediatrics that we talked about before those folks came out very strongly church organizations have come out very strong ones even part of the evangelical community sees this as a line and you know and a little pushed too far we can't accept this as Americans we can't just talk about it though we've sent a letter I've sent a letter to Rodney Frelinghuysen who's the chairman of appropriations you better allow money from the Appropriations to go to any of these because if we continue to fund them they'll continue to grow and that's what I'm very concerned about right now president has to step up to the plate he's got to do his job for change thank you for going and bearing witness to this moral outrage this is horrific I can't believe that this is happening in America that we're using children as political pawns for a border wall what can americans do reach out to our congress congressional representatives but what can we do to stop this as quickly as possible great question the president is gonna be on the hill this week meeting with our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle if the American people reach out to all of their representatives in the House in the Senate and Express the sheer outrage at the notion of a policy being put into place by our government that's unconscionable unacceptable unamerican eventually hopefully we'll see my colleagues on the other side I'll communicate to the president that this is not acceptable and the president can end this today with a phone call to his so-called beleaguered Attorney General saying enough this ends so I have a quick question so there are two different things going on right and you mentioned this before that there are people who cross the border illegally at an unrecognized border crossing place carrying a kid they're arrested either as a misdemeanor because it's a first offense or a felony if it's another offense and then there are people who come to the border at a proprietary and request asylum because of a fear of persecution or violence right these are two different procedures so what we are being told although it seems to be entirely anecdotal is that there are people who are being caught in the dragnet who are following the law they come they request asylum they have a kid with them and yet this is still happening that was your cue were you were I think you said told that by at least one person that they had followed the rules and then yet arrested and had their kid taken from them anyways right we're no longer as sessions that said we're not going to accept asylum for those folks who are under tremendous pressure through gangs or the government itself and that's why they have left for fear of their own family their own their own security we're not going to accept those people when I'm you know listen to them so now we have a backup of people who want to come to this country for very specific reasons and we're starting to check off those some of the reasons that we've accepted people before at least listen to them we didn't separate them from their children that's the one thing we didn't do there is no justification for that what so ever what political end are we looking for here what's what's the endgame well I'm I'm a couple of ideas on that I'm I'm petrified though because this is one Center in New Jersey yeah and there are multiple centers in the u.s. that reporters haven't been allowed access to I believe that reporters have only been allowed access to two centers so those have been cherry picked and our the best case scenario and yet the pictures and images are still horrifying where are the young children where are the girls well the three individuals who we met with who were apprehended on the southern border though they had voluntarily turned themselves in seeking political asylum had no idea where their children were some of whom had been in this detention center for months and it didn't seem as if any of the individuals who were responsible for their quote-unquote care in that facility had endeavored to try to figure that out there was one individual a father who had his daughter torn away from him at 3 a.m. in the morning yeah who fell down to his knees as he communicated to us begging for them not to take her away as she was crying this is somebody who fled one of the most violent nations in the world in Central America as the others had because a gang had showed up earlier in the day looking for his daughter at the school and he decided at that point that was enough he was going to take this risky journey in order to save his child and we know that mother's all across the country who have been apprehended on the southern border have done the same exact thing right so again important to keep to the facts we really appreciate your all going and getting first-hand accounts definitely queue up the Attorney General jeff Sessions bite in April where he announces this policy himself this policy is brought forward by the Trump administration and announced by the Attorney General you will hear otherwise from the president at times blaming it on Democrats it's not politics it's a lie congressman bill Pascrell and Hakeem Jeffries thank you so much appreciate it our next guest has served in the last three Republican administrations and says the political divisions in this nation will only get worse after Bob Muller releases his obstruction report Pete Waner joins the discussion next if you cross the border unlawfully then we will prosecute you it's that simple if you are smuggling a child then we will prosecute you and that child may be separated from you as required by law thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around
