the Wellesley news the student newspaper of Wellesley College for women has issued a ringing defense of banning speech I wish I were kidding but during a debate on whether to ban feminist speaker Laura Kipnis from the campus the student journalist published an editorial saying that Liberty free thought and open debate are not for Wellesley girls the students say that banning speech they disagree with is not a violation of the principles of free speech because if the speech was supposed to be free they would agree with it and it wouldn't be banned but if it's banned they don't agree with it so it isn't free there's something the students call speech they disagree with hate speech because they hate it they hate it because they disagree with it and that makes it hateful everything they disagree with is hateful because otherwise they would have to listen to it which they would hate so the principles of free speech demand that they ban speech they shouldn't that shouldn't be free because it's been hate speech can be banned without violating free speech because if it were free speech it would be called free instead of hate and then they wouldn't hate it and it wouldn't be banned because it would be free and they would agree with it that's how you can tell speech that shouldn't be banned if Wellesley College girls agree with it otherwise it's hateful or they would agree with it and it would be free the editorial in the Wellesley news says quote and this I swear is an actual quote edited for brevity quote we have all said problematic claims the origins of which were ingrained in us by our discriminatory and bias society luckily most of us have been taught by our peers and mentors at Wellesley in a productive way this being said if people are given the resources to learn and either continue to speak hate speech or refuse to adapt their beliefs then hostility may be warranted unquote now some of you may read that and say wow that's ungrammatical to the point of being illiterate but this is to ignore the fact that it's also Orwellian to the point of being fascistic some of you may ask yourself how did a group of spoiled privileged whiny spoiled and also Hawaii young ladies turn into such little Nazis well it's because they were taught by big Nazi wellesley faculty also defend the practice of banning speech they disagree with six faculty members wrote a letter saying such speech imposes on the liberty of students by forcing them to quote invest time and energy in rebutting the speaker's arguments unquote I agree rebutting arguments also known as thinking or learning is not the sort of thing we want going on at our institutions of higher education especially institutions for women the last thing we want are women who know how to think and debate good god we'd never hear the end of it the next thing you know there'd be women walking around forming their own independent ideas fortunately for the women of Wellesley that's not going to be a problem trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show
