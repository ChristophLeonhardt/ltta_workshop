police have identified the YouTube shooter this was the woman who opened fire at the YouTube campus in San Bruno California and other than the shooter herself luckily no fatalities were reported three individuals were reported to have injuries and they are still being treated at the hospital but here's what we know about the woman who opened fire her name is Nasim Najafi Adam and she's from San Diego she allegedly opened fire at the text tech giant's main campus in San Bruno wounding three people before turning the gun on herself so that has officially been confirmed the gunshot wound was a self-inflicted wound apparently she used a pistol in the shooting and so far there's no indication that she obtained it illegally in fact it has been confirmed that she purchased the gun legally or at least had the gun legally now she visited gun range hours before she showed up at YouTube's California campus another interesting components of this story was that her family had reported her missing they were concerned about her and then authorities had found her near the YouTube campus essentially in her car and when the authorities had alerted her parents that she had been found and they let them know where her location was they said that they were concerned because she was angry at YouTube and she was holding a grudge against YouTube over her videos being demonetised okay so let's give you some more details on that now Mountain View officers had found her sleeping in her car early Tuesday hours before the shooting and described that she did not pose a threat which is why they didn't take her in custody they let her go now here is what the San Bruno police chief says we have a pretty good idea but we'd like to get some more information before we can definitely say exactly what that motive was but obviously she was upset with some of the practices or policies that the company had employed now Good Morning America did a piece on this this morning and it kind of gives you some more insight into that but we toss that video Genk I wanted to give you a chance to chime in yeah so sometimes they'll say things like as if they're surprising it turns out her gun was legal yeah of course it's the easiest thing in the world about illegal guns so I never find it interesting whether the gun is legal or illegal this were in a sea of guns all you have to do is just pick one up it's 250 million guns by the time we do this video there's probably 260 million guns in the country and so and then they say like oh she went to a gun range yeah people go to gun ranges all the time if you think that that's a significant issue that all there's all these guns and people are shooting getting ready to shoot people I agree with you that's a massive issue but if you want to do something about it the gun rights people will flip out and they'll say if they caught her and by the way the cops did talk to her Zanta pointed out before beforehand and the one thing that was alarming here was her own family saying watch out she might be dangerous we're worried about what she might do including to herself right but when you go to stop her I got a legal gun I'm going to a gun range so what were you gonna do about I didn't know that the cops knew this she had gotten the gun rights at that point but she could have just told him it wouldn't have made any difference she could just scream I and then everybody would flank to defend her and so just don't pretend to be outraged after the fact so let's take a look at the video no it'll also give you a sense of what type of content she was putting up on YouTube take a look law enforcement officials say this is the woman 38 year-old Nasim Adam who stormed into an employee patio at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno California shooting three employees before turning the gun on herself her family says the prolific YouTube user my name is nastiness hated the company claiming it was censoring her content and not paying her for the videos she posted on the platform I'm being discriminated unfiltered on YouTube she had a YouTube channel which posted a black out videos and many of them in 4c her brother says her family reported her missing over the weekend and claims they told police about her deep-seated resentment towards YouTube and she had a problem we caught that so in one of her videos she was quoted as saying there is no free speech in real world and you will be suppressed for telling the truth that is not supported by the system videos of targeted users are filtered and merely relegated so that people can hardly see their video so she was pretty clear about her frustration toward YouTube a lot of content creators have felt frustration toward YouTube fairly recently because of videos getting demonetized and a huge reason behind that has to do with the fact that advertisers started to get incredibly uncomfortable with some of the content that their advertisements were appearing on so there were some specific cases that made news involving content creators who said things that were you know used the n-word or use language that the advertisers didn't like and so they threatened to pull all their ads from YouTube in general and then YouTube wanted to appease them and essentially did change their policies using an algorithm that would D monetize certain videos that the advertisers didn't like and this impacted everyone across the ideological spectrum doesn't matter if you're conservative doesn't matter if your progressive everyone every channel experienced their content getting demonetized because of the algorithm think about the billions of hours worth of YouTube content that gets uploaded on a regular basis they don't have the manpower to watch all that content so they rely on that algorithm and admittedly the algorithm is a bit flawed and so people have been frustrated she seems to be one of those individuals and they made a lot of progress in fixing that algorithm as well so look we got hit pretty hard by the D monetization as well and there is great irony that we were all punished whether we're in politics are not in politics or if we're good guys or bad guys for the insane rantings of generally speaking right-wing guys who said racist things and and things filled with bigotry etc and add for those like I don't want to have my product in front of those videos because it's gonna turn off a lot of my customers and I don't want to turn off my customers so then we all got D monetized and and then the right-wing of course has always cried the hardest even though it hit us all and it was their fault right but nonetheless they went and and did all that and then they got people all riled up like this lady but look this woman you think you would have been on air anywhere without YouTube do you think your abs and your dolphin videos we're gonna make it on the ABC so look I'll admit my advice I've been a fan of YouTube for a long long time and we were the first partner for YouTube but my bias is born out of reality out of facts because they allow for independent voices and independent voices that the establishment media shuts out so to then complain that you're not giving me enough money look you can there's legitimate ways to say hey how can we fix this together right and then there's what she did which is madness and insanity and terrorize people and she claims to be she was apparently an extreme vegan I'll grant you this she was extreme and if she says this she was four and here's a direct quote for me animal rights equals human rights well how about the rights of the humans that you try to murder exactly exactly and you know to your point regarding YouTube and D monetization so there are a lot of conversations about how YouTube is censoring people so first off advertisers not wanting to spend money on your videos be they're afraid of the content in your videos and afraid of it being too controversial is not the same as censorship if YouTube was pulling your video down literally not letting you post videos because of your ideas or your beliefs then you have a case absolutely that censorship but by the way just let me be clear it's not government censorship yeah as we've discussed many times yeah exactly it's not a constitutional violation it is a private company they're able to do what they want they're not the government okay so so I'm thank you for clarifying that but with that said YouTube doesn't pull the videos down it gets demonetised based on their algorithm which again need an improvement you say that there has been some improvement but I think that there's still more I think you too can improve transparency explain in in better detail why the videos got demonetized but look my point is well we need to address more than anything is you know the fear of these advertisers because they do get scared very easily and I think what they need to open themselves up to is content other than the squeaky clean television stuff that they've been so comfortable with which is by the way not squeaky clean right so you know last thing on that if you're gonna get angry first of all please do it in a productive way right and and so obviously this is the most extreme example but there's a lot of people who are getting angry in a non-productive ways but and and have some sense as to who you're directing it at and in terms of the advertisers it's not it's not YouTube it is clearly the advertisers Anna's absolutely right about that but even in terms of those the productive way to handle that I think is wait a minute guys let's talk about the hypocrisy here as you advertise on televisions on two different fronts one in general I mean we did the story about The Bachelor the other day I mean that is yeah that's a great point emotional pornography at its worst you have a woman who's broken down and just crying and crying and they will not take the camera off of her it's just gross but advertisers flock to it they're like well that kind of gross disgusting stuff on airs one full right and then you watch any of the shows including like things like two and a Half Men that was you know number one for however many decades right they are constantly making jokes about prostitutes and sex if you did that on YouTube I don't know if that's saved right right but it's so there's gigantic hypocrisy along those lines and let me be clear about look when Jake is saying that they would see it on YouTube and they only we don't know if that's safe it's not that they're actually watching that content and making a decision based on that content they because so much content gets uploaded onto YouTube again they rely on an algorithm so you know that D monetization gets triggered by certain tags and certain wording in the in the video but it's not one person who's sitting there and thinking hmmm this is too conservative for me D monetized it doesn't work that way or this is too progressive for me or this is too sex oriented for me it just doesn't work that way and by the way I mean look yes we've been hit and we will continue to get hit as we cover content that triggers you know the D monetization and we have to have conversations about that on a regular basis and guess what we still do stories that we know will not be monetized because at least we have the ability to get the word out about those stories and that's why I respect you too it sucks this D monetization thing sucks but I would rather not get paid for that video and still have the ability to use my platform to draw attention to that story so that's just my take I understand if people disagree with it and final note on that is look everyone has a bias and what the mainstream media is doing now is taking advantage of situations like this whether it's Cambridge analytical scandal at Facebook or it's the you know an ad appearing from some racist video on YouTube to say nope now the only news that is acceptable is CNN Washington Post etc now do are they clean they have no bias at all they just drop down from heaven and earth onto earth and and they only deliver you the truth look I respect those guys I tell you'd like to all the conspiracy theories about how they get together in a room and make up stories is preposterous etc but they do have a bias and that is in favor of the status quo because they are run by multibillion-dollar corporations and they don't want change there on top of course they don't want to change and that oozes into all of their content so let's not pretend that they don't have a bias they do so if I was an advertiser I would want to get sure I mean they CNN has a bias but I put my product on there and then I would also put it on a left-wing perspective and I'd put it on a right-wing perspective I get it if an advertiser doesn't want to offend huge swaths of of their customers by calling them the n-word or alienating 1.6 billion Muslims in the world because they'd like to sell coke and Nike to them I understand that but at the same time it people that are on the left and the right are the majority of the country so if you don't if you're afraid to run your ad to people who have those positions then you wind up running it to no one which is kind of what's happening on television all the young people have left right and they're still trying to force their ads into their because it's considered acceptable whether it actually is or not what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it you get a completely ad free if you could
