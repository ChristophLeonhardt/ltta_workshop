the lawsuit filed by the Democratic National Committee against President Jerome's campaign WikiLeaks and the Russian government which inspire hello I'm Richard gisbert and you're at The Listening Post here are some of the media stories were covering this week Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were on the losing side in 2016 now they're looking for a victory in court against WikiLeaks an Egyptian photographer wins an award from the United Nations and the Sisi government pushes back calling him a terrorist based in Kuala Lumpur broadcasting via YouTube and on satellite rojan GOTV gets to the heart of the story in Myanmar and Comcast cars day Comcast cares day the American cable company that's not afraid to blow its own horn or to get its journalists to blow it for them then happy Comcast cares day it's been almost a year and a half now since the election of Donald Trump and the opposition Democrats still haven't moved on from the defeat of Hillary Clinton last week the party filed a lawsuit in New York over the hacking and publishing of emails from the Democratic National Committee the DNC in 2016 the defendants in the suit are the Russian government the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks the timing with midterm elections about six months away may well be political but suing WikiLeaks a news organization for publishing leaked material when it is hardly the only news outlet to do so could set a troubling precedent for press freedom in America the US media have remained strangely silent on the implications busily obsessing over Russian meddling in the election the Moller investigation and Donald Trump's own rhetorical war against the media reporters have been taking a pass on the DNC lawsuit story and the legal assault on the Fourth Estate that's coming from the other side of the aisle our starting point this week is Washington alleges that Trump campaign was essentially a racketeering enterprise that's a pretty serious allegation does this do the Bolar investigation in the coverage of this lawsuit three of the four principles involved are getting most of the attention the plaintiffs the DNC which is the governing body of the Democratic Party and two of the defendants the Russian government and the Trump campaign the fourth element which operates on the margins of the Fourth Estate is WikiLeaks the DNC is suing WikiLeaks because they're through the central player but weren't for their platform if it weren't for WikiLeaks essentially conspiring with Russian operatives this one had been a story and it wasn't just a platform I mean they marketed these emails they were reaching out to the reporters so you can't really I don't think if you're the DNC you know file a lawsuit and ignore the role of WikiLeaks and all of this the DNC has instead of engaging in internal reforms and self-criticism has doubled down and blamed WikiLeaks WikiLeaks exposed that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC conspired to prevent Bernie Sanders from actually having a fair shot in the primary made sure that Hillary Clinton always was going to be the candidate and it's very clear that this is a concerted attempt by the DNC to blame multiple external actors for its own internal problems that led to its own loss in the 2016 presidential election the core issue in this story is not what was in those hacked emails the DNC sabotaging of the Sanders campaign it's unseemly cap in hand approach to financial donors but how those emails found their way into the media food chain in the first place cybersecurity specialists say the hackers who infiltrated the DNC servers were Russian Julian Assange and WikiLeaks have stuck to their policy of neither confirming nor denying who their sources are saying only that the source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party WikiLeaks acquired the files and started publishing the emails four months prior to the 2016 election and it was not alone no major US media outlet ignored the story it was for better or worse considered newsworthy these were stolen conversations and I don't think that journalists took proper care to to vet them it's not that they weren't true but the motive in releasing them in order to demonize the Democrats when there was no such comparable effort on the part of Republicans that was not handled well journalists just rushed into print without considering the source without considering what was behind them without explaining it to their readers and this had the effect of perverting the political discourse the 2016 election was highly partisan it was highly divisive I think too that many in the mainstream media did not want to make it appear that they were ignoring information that was coming out of the DNC that might have an impact on how people chose to vote thousands of leaked emails show Democratic Party officials possibly plotting against Bernie Sanders and I think for many of them if they chose not to reveal the salient points of the DNC emails it would appear that they were trying to assist the Clinton campaign look the context here is everyone and I mean everyone in the summer and fall of 2016 thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election so unfortunately for the press there was a real animus towards Hillary Clinton and I think they saw their role is how to make sure she kind of just stumbles across the finish line how do we make this so it's not a triumphant historic victory I don't think they understood the gravity of the situation and absolutely they did not ask the difficult questions why are we publishing stolen documents however the DNC which has an ongoing relationship with papers like the New York Times and the news networks has not taken legal issue with any of those organizations over there coverage of the story the lawsuit targets the alleged source of the emails the Russian government and the middleman WikiLeaks but it spares papers like The Times and other news outlets that took what WikiLeaks provided them and fed it to American voters most of the people who publish these things are media outlets that would have some First Amendment protection and even if they don't going after them might somehow compromise the First Amendment whereas WikiLeaks they don't look anything like a media organization they're not a newspaper they're not even a website with reporters or anything like that or editors it's an organization that helps to steal information from people sometimes governments sometimes others who they think are powerful and they happen to disagree with and then publishes it that's not press freedom to me that's theft the exact status of WikiLeaks is still subject to debate discussion and discovery people in the intelligence community regard WikiLeaks is simply a spying organization but there are others who think of it as a news organization under US constitutional law we don't really define the news media so it seems to me that WikiLeaks can certainly make the case that they are acting as a news organization but even if they are if they have violated other laws simply because they're a news organization does not make them immune from either civil suit or prosecution the DNC is not alleging that WikiLeaks was involved in this hacking the DNC is simply making political accusations against WikiLeaks claiming that by publishing these materials it wanted Trump to win that is not a crime and you cannot try someone in court for publishing documents because the New York Times The Washington Post they have all four decades published leaked and even stolen documents the Pentagon Papers one of the most important leaks in modern history were stolen and then they were published by multiple major media outlets and the US Supreme Court confirmed that this was entirely legal this would have a major chilling impact on journalism as a whole were WikiLeaks to be held liable criminally for publishing documents that may have allegedly been stolen fears for the future of American journalism have grown de rigueur ever since the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House but for all the president's bluster all those tweets about fake news his accusations of political bias and agenda Laden coverage the Trump administration has yet to launch a legal case like this one it's the Democrats that have taken aim at an offshore target WikiLeaks through a lawsuit that could one day prove to have implications for news outlets much closer to home I don't see the Democrats going after the press I see the Democrats as being allied with the press in trying to expose the attack that Donald Trump is leveling both on the press and on the fundamental aspects of American democracy I would be concerned if they were going after a legitimate press organizations internal workings but they're not they're going after WikiLeaks which is in the business of stealing many of those who dislike WikiLeaks who consider it to be an extremely problematic organization would say that this kind of lost it against them is perfectly acceptable and has no First Amendment ramifications I disagree I think a broad interpretation of the First Amendment would cover WikiLeaks so I would hope that news organizations would focus not on WikiLeaks but rather on the principles that are at stake if this is a successful campaign against WikiLeaks it would have ramifications for other news organizations news organizations should be concerned about that aspect of the case we're discussing other media stories that are on our radar today with one of our producers Flo Phillips flow this past week UNESCO announced that it's giving its World Press Freedom Award for 2018 to an imprisoned Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Abbas a 't but this hasn't gone down well with the authorities in cairo has it no and they've made their unhappiness known egypt's foreign ministry says abu zaid who's better known as shao kahn was involved in terrorism it also warned UNESCO even before the award was announced but to recognize Shao Khan in this way involves contempt for the state of law but just on that point the law Shao Kahn has been in prison now without charge for nearly five years Egyptian law stipulates no one can be held without charge for more than two years and the prosecution has made all kinds of accusations including one of attempted murder but has failed to back that up with any evidence let alone a formal charge and how has char cancer ward gone down in the Egyptian news media the vast majority of which backs the Sisi government unreservedly well they're not exactly basking in national pride on behalf of that colleague Egyptian TV talk show hosts like Ahmed Moussa are among the government's loudest backers they're happy to let me do Gaza Gaza a criminal criminal in that semester Abu Larry masha'Allah even Osama to be title eylem did Shao Kahn was arrested back in 2013 while covering a pro Muslim Brotherhood protest in Cairo he denies all allegations against him the UNESCO jury president Maria Reza said that this award pays tribute to Shao Kahn's courage resistance and commitment to freedom of expression and Shao Kahn is not alone Egypt has at least 20 journalists behind bars only Turkey and China have more now that number includes an Al Jazeera journalist Mahmoud Hussain who spent almost 500 days in jail again in Cairo and again without charge you've also been looking at the decidedly low-tech information war that's been taking place along the border between North and South Korea more like what's not taking place anymore ever since North Korea's fourth nuclear test just over a year ago South Korea had been pumping out propogate and news pop music from loudspeakers along the border North Korea retaliated with its own broadcast as well as launching balloons with leaflets carrying anti South Korean messages but just ahead of Friday's summit between the two Korean leaders South Korea's military announced it was putting a stop to its propaganda to ease military tension it said between the two Koreas and create a peaceful environment and the coverage of the summit itself issues like access live broadcasts all of that had to be worked out between two governments that take vastly different approaches to the media and because the meeting was unprecedented no North Korean leader had set foot in South Korea since 1953 so it took a lot of negotiating with Pyongyang to allow live television broadcasts for key parts of the summit and with the upcoming meeting between president Trump and North Korea's Kim jong-un it's gonna be interesting to see what kind of media access the North Koreans will agree to not that that is stop Trump from getting out in front of this story treating the outcome as a done deal he tweeted that the North has agreed to denuclearization so great for the world site closure and no more testing okay thanks Flo since the military campaign against Myanmar's row hinge a minority began eight months ago almost three quarters of a million row Hinshaw Muslims have taken flight across the border and into Bangladesh from the outset Myanmar's government has tried to control the narrative denying journalists access to the story intimidating them and dismissing accusations of arson rape and mass murder by Myanmar security forces as fake news because they've been kept at a distance the international media and NGOs have struggled to get the facts but there is one broadcaster still reporting from the inside row hinge a vision TV run by exiled revenge' the network relies on undercover reporters to get information out and the stories they tell contest the Myanmar government's version of events as well as the national media outlets that have closed ranks with the authorities the listening posts Johanna who snow on the perilous state of media freedom in Myanmar and the news network telling the row hinges story their way the number Jeep Cherokee balaclava Yaya Han tiger honor to be Yusuf Atta girl dunya is an evolutionary over it further clue to hurry the Coriolis ie the manila not in I be sending over a lot at him he said Gary what refugees like Nora Mustafa no Sirach Ahmed's and Mohammed Jabbar say they have seen on the grounds are acts of rape torture massacres of their own people at the hands of the Myanmar security forces stories that journalists from Myanmar tend to shy away from for the hundreds of thousands of refugees across the border in Bangladesh for hinge a vision TV or our vision provides news from a rohesia perspective we started to get news actual facts and figure from the ground and I started to broadcast so the ultimate goal was to tell the truth to tell the wrong angle side of the story and to advocate rouhani applied because rouhani is underreported rouhani is misreported they're reporting the mass rapes have occurred that there has been effectively a scorched earth campaign against the reinjure where I got a call for Eddie our monitor Connery John what the robbery body that's you know women children have been executed along with men range of vision TV helped to sort of counter this idea that it is just the targeted operation to weed out range of militants but they're of course branded as brazen propaganda and they've been targeted with relentless attempts to discredit them we saw at the start of the crisis in August where hinge revision TV and very accurately reporting what was going on the number of people that were fleeing the scale of the violence and that information wasn't used by international media at all because there's been such a fuss made by the government of Burma about the reliability of our hinges sources and that's a loss because they are getting information out on the in return state and that significant me Amar's government has blocked all access to the region turning her kind into a black hole for the news without access international journalists have come to rely solely on refugees accounts while much of the Myanmar media run with the government's version of events but row hinge a vision still has eyes on the ground according to its founder Muhammed North the channel has a network of 60 Undercovers citizen journalists working around the clock and a great risk to feed information from recline or reconnaissance known in the Rohini language to their colleagues in Malaysia broadcasting in four languages including Rahim John English our vision operates primarily online through its YouTube channel and Facebook page the network has become a primary source of news for the revenger community its pages typically get more than a hundred thousand views per day our vision is very unique and it is the world first of its its kind international media's are not allowed here so they cannot do their job so now we have to take over the job we are the news breaker of our economy cause we convert a citizen into citizen journalists existing people into journalists training them and getting the information out with whatever possible equipment they have it's very dangerous for for the people on the ground that are doing this the government want to shut this down they want to stop information getting out and so anyone who's found to be involved with orange revision TV you would be in danger of being jailed or disappeared they'll go after the people that are interviewed they'll go after the fixer as well as going after the journalists who are doing the reporting those tactics aren't just applied to the rare injured journalists operating in Rakhine ever since the start of the military crackdown 8 months ago the government of Aung San su Chi has embarked on a far-reaching campaign to silence reporters both local and foreign intimidation harassment and the weight of the law have been used on journalists who cast the government or military in a bad light case in points four months ago two Reuters reporters were arrested and charged under the Official Secrets Act a law that dates back to the colonial era for allegedly having illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media they face up to 14 years in prison with those documents which supposedly contained information about mass graves they were kind were in fact handed to them by the Myanmar police just minutes before they were arrested a police captain's testimony that the reporters were indeed framed is currently under review but regardless the circumstances of the arrest have left critics suspicious over what happened I think that certainly is reason to believe that it was part of the government set up the way it went down with the journalists arrested as soon as they left the restaurant the very shaky testimony given by police in courts those two reporters are very well respected they're very dogged why alone and jostle and do you know the Reuters teams and the AP teams in the country and known to be very courageous in their reporting on this issue the government and the military and the police would want to silence them the two reporters were trying to expose something that the military were you know wanted to hide what the Jew journalist did is the main reason that the government had detained them they still use you know a number of laws to detain journalists and these laws are very useful for the government who AM iam our began to transition from military to civilian rule back in 2011 there was hope space would open up for more independent reporting that hope has since been shattered under our sonsoo cheese rule reporting critical of the authorities has all but disappeared especially on issues relating to recline and it's not just due to government intimidation or self-censorship when it comes to the rural India most media outlets in Myanmar simply agree with the government line the vast majority of journalists Burmese journalists inside the country appear to share the government in the military's antagonism towards the revenger magazines when newspapers like the state-run united yama which publishes very unsettling antagonistic editorials and articles that are lewd to the reinjure as for example human fleas so regardless of whether you know there is space or there isn't space there's a real lack of will in reporting critically on the military I think the local media trying not to sort of finger their audience their readers so they try to sort of tread a very careful line trying to balance do their work as well as not to sort of make the the readership unhappy because I think they understand that the majority of the people don't like the they did this row hinge are people the government of Burma is trying to say look what can we do we can't take action on the Ranger citizenship because the Ranger is so so hated within the country but the government has used its media channels and newspapers and radio stations and television to encourage and whip up that fear and hatred of Muslims so they create this crisis and then they use it as a defense for not being able to act on it it's a tactic that they're using it's a tactic that is proving all too effective which makes outlets like we're in division TV a rare source of the new still operating behind the authority's veil of secrecy all the more important when trying to understand all sides of a story that the United Nations cause a textbook case of ethnic cleansing and finally a few weeks back we reported on how an American company the pro-trump Sinclair Broadcast Group used its network of local television stations to push the corporation's political message it was a bit creepy this past week another American broadcast giant Comcast used its cable news network MSNBC and local NBC affiliates to promote Comcast cares a national day of volunteering on the part of the company's staff now Comcast can use some good PR because polls say that like some other big media and cable companies its amongst the least popular corporations in the country and if Comcast cares to listen to some of the reaction its campaign has been getting online it might want to rethink its PR strategy we'll see you next time here at The Listening Post Comcast cares day is part of our year-round commitment of making a difference the 15th annual Comcast cares day its Comcast cares day we celebrate Comcast cares day good morning guys and happy Comcast cares day celebrate Comcast cares day it is believed to be the nation's largest single day corporate volunteer event single largest national corporate volunteering event taking place tomorrow powered by Comcast part of one of the largest private volunteer efforts in the US every year and it's put on by our parent company Comcast for our company to help make change happen and to make the world a better place when we're done picking up litter removing weeds so that by the time the kids return on Monday their smiles will shine as bright as their clubs are you excited of what we're gonna do today they say today we're gonna pick up some trash is that okay there's okay and then and to think that the next day kids were going to come to school and see their whole classroom brightened up we were just so happy to be part of it it's truth be told it's really fun it's not too difficult it really does enrich you to give of yourself this is what I think the way we can bring the world to where Mandela wanted us where corporations don't become expansive and influence you just for personal wealth before purpose
