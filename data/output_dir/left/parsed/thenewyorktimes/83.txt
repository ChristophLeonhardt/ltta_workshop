Hey, this is Jon
M. Chu, director
of “Crazy Rich Asians."
And this is in the beginning
of the movie, where
we get to meet
Rachel Chu, played
by the incredible
Constance Wu,
and Nick Young, played
by Henry Golding, who,
this is his first movie.
We found him from our
accountant in Malaysia.
He was a travel host there.
Never done a movie before,
so this is his first movie.
This is his second
day shooting.
And he really improved
every day he was there.
He’s an incredible actor,
actually, and super natural.
And you’re going
to see him a lot.
And he plays the
lead in our movie.
And here, he’s inviting her to
Singapore to meet his family.
What she doesn’t know
is that his family
is the richest in Singapore.
And so she’s about to fly into
a hornet’s nest, as they say.
This is a very popular
section in the book.
In our script, it’s
about two sentences.
So we had to design
from the ground up.
But in the book, they talk
about how all the gossip
spreads through Radio 1 Asia.
And you can see
her slyly taking
a cell phone pic there.
And she’s going to pass
it on to all the friends,
socialites, ex-girlfriends,
family members
to destroy this American girl
coming to Singapore to take
their man.
How did we communicate
this stuff is through text
message and social media.
And there’s so much and so
many ways you can do it.
We really didn’t want to
shoot people’s screens.
So we tried to come up
with the most buoyant way
that even the book describes
of how information passes.
So we had these wispy,
colorful things,
sort of in the colors
of the book covers,
that spread through all the
people throughout Singapore.
And we had a great
company, Aspect Ratio,
to help design it.
There’s my baby in
the second there,
screaming “no," that was
born about two weeks after we
finished shooting.
And then we really
wanted to show
that this information
was spreading
all around the
world and ending up
at this beautiful home,
during this Bible study, where
we meet Michelle Yeoh, who
plays Nick Young’s mother
and wants nothing to do with
this American girl coming
to Singapore, which is very
relatable to my experience
as an Asian-American going
to Asia for the first time,
where it feels sort of like
home but not like home.
And that’s really what our
movie is about is this dual
cultural identity that
we all go through,
especially in this
generation of no matter where
you’re from — whether
you’re Asian or not —
everyone’s figuring out who
we want to be for the future.
And so text messaging
is a great way
to show all the ways
that those things spread.
