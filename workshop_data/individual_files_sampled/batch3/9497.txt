GREG. IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY AND THIS IS "THE FIVE" ." PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST WRAPPING UP A MEETING WITH FBI DIRECTOR CHRIS WRAY, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DAN COATS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS COMES AS THE PRESIDENT IS DEMANDING ANSWERS OVER A SERIES OF REPORTS THAT AN FBI INFORMANT WAS IN CONTACT WITH ASSOCIATES OF HIS CAMPAIGN. TRUMPET TWEETING THAT THE DOJ NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE IF THE CAMPAIGN WAS "INFILTRATED OR SURVEILLED AND IF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS INVOLVED." DOJ IS RESPONDING BY ASKING ITS INSPECTOR GENERAL TO LOOK AT THESE ALLEGATIONS. VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT PENCE IS REACTING TO THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT IN A SIT DOWN WITH MARTHA MacCALLUM. THE PRESIDENT I THINK HE IS GRATEFUL THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS GOING TO HAVE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL LOOK INTO IT AND DETERMINE AND ENSURE THAT THERE WAS NO SURVEILLANCE DONE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. AGAINST OUR CAMPAIGN. I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY TROUBLING TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS OF THAT TOOK PLACE. Jesse: HOUSE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES IS SAYING IF THIS IS TRUE, IT'S A MAJOR SCANDAL. IF THEY RAN A SPY RING OR INFORMANT RING AND THEY WERE PAYING PEOPLE WITHIN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, IF ANY OF THAT IS TRUE, THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE REDLINE. YOU CAN DO THIS TO POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS. ACCORDING TO THEM, THIS WAS DONE IN THE SPRING BEFORE THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION WAS EVEN OPENED. IF THAT'S TRUE, WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT. Jesse: MEANWHILE FORMER DOJ OFFICIAL SALLY YATES IS LOSING IT OVER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REQUEST. WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN HIS ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON THE RULE OF LAW TO A NEW LEVEL. THIS TIME HE IS ORDERING UP AN INVESTIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATORS. WHO ARE EXAMINING HIS OWN CAMPAIGN. THAT'S REALLY SHOCKING. Jesse: ALL RIGHT, YOU WOULD EXPECT PEOPLE FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO SAY THINGS LIKE THAT, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN ALSO LASHED OUT ON TWITTER. BUT IF THIS INFORMATION IS CORRECT, KIMBERLY, HOW DEVASTATING WOULD IT BE FOR OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES? Kimberly: IT IS QUITE DISCONCERTING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. IF THERE'S ACTUALLY AN ACTIVE SPY OPERATION WITHIN A CAMPAIGN, YOU WOULD HOPE THAT IF THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS A VEIN THAT WAS AT RISK WITH RESPECT TO RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE, THAT THEY WOULD IN FACT GO TO CANDIDATE TRUMP AT THE TIME OR SOME OFFICIAL IN THE CAMPAIGN AND SAY LISTEN WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION WE BELIEVE PERHAPS YOUR CAMPAIGN COULD HAVE AN ISSUE AND SOMEONE COULD TRY TO GET INVOLVED OR TRIED TO GET INTELLIGENCE FROM YOU. BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. IT'S SORT OF BELIES THAT TRUTH AND ACCURACY OF IT, AND THEN YOU SAW "THE NEW YORK TIMES" PREEMPT AND PUT THIS OUT THERE IN ADVANCE OF THE IG REPORT WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE DAMNING. THEY SAY WE ARE LOOKING TO PROTECT YOU. IT DOESN'T RING TRUE. WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE TRANSPARENT AND TELL THEM INSTEAD OF TRYING TO ENTRAP? THE FBI'S JOB IS NOT TO SPY ON CAMPAIGNS OR PLAY SOMEBODY WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THAT WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THA THAT. COMPLETELY OUT-OF-BOUNDS. Jesse: COMEY SAID HE WAS SUSPICIOUS IN THE SPRING OF 2016, DECIDED NOT TO INFORM THE CAMPAIGN IN THE SPRING THAT THE RUSSIANS MIGHT BE UP TO SOMETHING. AND THEN THEY LOOKED AT PAPADOPOULOS I THINK IN JULY OR AUGUST, GREG, THEY DIDN'T EVEN INTERVIEW HIM UNTIL JANUARY. THEY WAITED SIX MONTHS. WHY NOT, IF PAPADOPOULOS HAD HEARD SOMETHING, WHY NOT ASK THEM STRAIGHT UP WHAT IS GOING ON? Greg: THE MORE THEY KEEP TRYING TO FIND COLLUSION, THE MORE THEY FIND DEMOCRATS. THIS SCANDAL OR PSEUDO-SCANDAL IS ACTUALLY EASIER TO EXPLAIN TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT ALL OF THE OTHER COLLUSION STUFF. THEY SENT AN INFORMANT INTO TRAP TRUMP. I LOVE THE MEDIA EXPLANATION FOR THIS. WE ONLY SENT THIS INFORMANT IN THERE TO PROTECT DONALD TRUMP. WE WERE SPYING ON YOU AS A FAVOR. THAT IS LIKE SAYING THAT I AM STALKING YOU AS A FAVOR. ICE TOOL YOUR CAR SO NO ONE ELSE WOULD STEAL YOUR CAR. IT'S THE PLOT OF "NATIONAL TREASURE" WHEN NICOLAS CAGE STEALS THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. WHY DID THIS HAPPEN? WHY DID JOHN BRENNAN, WHY DID THEY DO THIS SET UP, WHY DID THEY SET THE TRAP? I BELIEVE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING GOD'S WORK. THAT THEY WERE ENERGIZED BY THE FRANTIC ALARMIST MEDIA ABOUT TRUMP OF WHICH I INCLUDE MYSELF BECAUSE I WAS EVERY BIT AS WORRIED ABOUT TRUMP AS ANYBODY DURING THE CAMPAIGN. I HAVE TO SAY I AM PART OF THE ALARMIST MEDIA. I THINK IF YOU WATCH THE NEWS AND YOU ARE PART OF THE NEWS AND YOU ARE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT, YOU CONVINCE YOURSELF THAT IF TRUMP BECAME PRESIDENT, THE COUNTRY WOULD BE IN PERIL. THEREFORE DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WHICH IS ILLEGAL, IS ACTUALLY PATRIOTIC. Jesse: THAT'S WHAT PETER STRZOK HIMSELF TEXTED. Greg: BUT THEY ARE WRONG. I ADMIT I WAS WRONG. THEY HAVE TO ADMIT THEY ARE WRONG. THEY MIGHT HAVE TO GO TO JAIL. Jesse: YOU ARE MAKING MORE MONEY THAN USUAL. THANK YOU, DONALD TRUMP. Greg: Jesse: NOW THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS ASKED THE DOJ TO DO THIS, FLIPPING THE SCRIPT, WHAT WILL IT DO TO THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. DOES IT ELONGATED? Dana: I SAW CHRIS CHRISTIE DOING AN INTERVIEW TODAY WHERE HE SAID THAT HE HAS GIVEN PRESIDENT TRUMP A LOT OF ADVICE AND HE SAID HE TELLS THEM THERE ARE WAYS TO SHORTEN THIS INVESTIGATION AND WAYS TO MAKE IT LONGER. SO FAR, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TAKEN EVERY STEP TO MAKE IT LONGER. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF WITH WHEN RUDY GIULIANI SAID MUELLER TOLD ME IT WOULD BE WRAPPED UP BY DECEMBER 1ST. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WOULD SAY THAT. I'M WILLING TO BELIEVE THE OBAMA TEAM HAD DONE THIS. THEY WERE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED. BUT ALL OF THESE THINGS, IF IT'S TRUE, IF IT'S TRUE, IF IT'S TRUE REMINDS ME OF THEY WIRETAPPED ME UP TRUMP TOWER WHICH TURNS OUT NOT TO HAVE BEEN THE CASE. I GUESS WE DON'T KNOW, AND THUS MAY BE IN THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION WE FOUND OUT THAT SOMEBODY ON THE CAMPAIGN DID HAVE A WIRETAP. A Jesse: I THINK MANAFORT HAD AN APARTMENT AT TRUMP TOWER. Dana: MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T OF HIRED MANAFORT. I AM WILLING TO WAIT FOR THE EVIDENCE AND I THINK OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HOWEVER ONE SEEMS TO ADMIRE AT LEAST SO FAR UNTIL HE SAYS SOMETHING THEY DON'T LIE, THAT EVERYONE THINKS HE'S DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB, THEY'RE WAITING FOR THE REPORT ON SECRETARY CLINTON'S EMAIL. I THINK THE HILLARY CLINTON TEAM HAS A RIGHT TO BE SOMEWHAT MAD, THAT THEIR POSITION IS YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT THE FBI WAS WILLING TO GO OUT ON THE RECORD WITH THE DIRECTOR TO SAY THAT I WOULD I WAS BEING INVESTIGATED, HILLARY CLINTON, AND THEN THEY PLAYED DOWN "NEW YORK TIMES" INQUIRIES ABOUT THE TRUMP TEAM BEING UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR RUSSIAN COLLUSION. Jesse: I DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT TRUMP WAS GOING TO WIN. Dana: THE FBI OR HILLARY? Greg: I THINK HILLARY SHOULD BE UPSET THAT THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T SEND A SPY INTO HER CAMPAIGN TO PROTECT THAT IS SEXISM. Dana: TO SAY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WIN MICHIGAN. Kimberly: PROTECT HER FROM HERSELF. Jesse: ACCORDING TO THE MEDIA, IT WAS NOT A SPY. IT WAS JUST AN INFORMANT. Juan: BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID "EMBEDDED." THERE WAS NO ONE EMBEDDED IN THE CAMPAIGN. THIS GUY IS A PROFESSOR SOMEWHERE IN BRITAIN AND WHAT HE DID WAS HE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THREE OH OFFICIALS, THREE OF WHOM HAD ALREADY PREVIOUSLY BEEN IMPLICATED IN TERMS OF CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIA. Jesse: WE HEARD IT WAS FOUR. Juan: OKAY. I WILL GO THREE. CARTER PAGE, GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS CARTER PAGE, GEORGE PAPADOPOULO PAPADOPOULOS, AND WHO'S THE OTHER? Jesse: FLYNN AND MANAFORT. Juan: NO, THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE. Jesse: EITHER WAY, YOU TALK TO THE CAMPAIGN PEOPLE. Juan: THE POINT IS NOBODY WAS EMBEDDED AND WHAT YOU HAVE IS A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION OF THE IDEA THAT RUSSIA IS INTERFERING IN AN AMERICAN ELECTION AND THEY DON'T LAUNCH, BY THE WAY, A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. THEY DO A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION. ALL THEY ARE DOING IS TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. THE THING THAT CONCERNS ME, AND I PICKED UP ON THIS, I THINK IT'S WHAT SALLY YATES WAS TALKING ABOUT. WE RELY ON OUR INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE, AND IF YOU START DOUBTING THEM, THIS COMES FROM CHRISTOPHER WRAY, YOU DO THAT, YOU PUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, YOU PUT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AT GREAT RISK IF WE CAN'T PROTECT OUR AGENTS. Greg: THEY MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR WHO HE WAS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. IF THEY REALLY DID CARE, AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN FAIR ABOUT THIS AND THEY WOULD HAVE DEALT WITH BOTH CAMPAIGNS. THEY ARE SAYING NOW OH, THE RUSSIANS WERE MORE INTERESTED IN TRUMP. THAT'S CONVENIENT NOW THAT EVERYBODY FINDS OUT YOU'VE BEEN PUTTING INFORMANTS. Juan: EVERYBODY HAS SAID, EVERYBODY FROM THE BIPARTISAN SENATE COMMITTEE HAS SAID RUSSIA FAVORED DONALD TRUMP TO WIN. WE LEARNED THIS WEEKEND, THE SAUDIS, THE ISRAELIS HAVE ALSO SAID WE HAVE AN INTEREST IN HELPING YOU OUT, MR. TRUMP. Jesse: I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE CHINESE DID WITH HILLARY. Greg: JUAN, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. Juan: OBAMA, CLINTON. Greg: THEY PAY THE GUY $400,000. Jesse: THE WEEK AFTER THE DNC SERVER WAS ALLEGEDLY HACKED BY THE RUSSIANS, THEY OPEN UP A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION TO SEE ABOUT RUSSIAN HACKING. KIMBERLY, THEY NEVER SEIZED THE SERVER. THEY NEVER LOOKED AT THE SERVER, RAN AN INVESTIGATION ON THE SERVER, DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WOULDN'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING THEY WOULD DO? Kimberly: YOU WOULD THINK. HOW ABOUT TURN OVER THE PHYSICAL, TANGIBLE EVIDENCE SO THEY CAN DO A PROPER FORENSICS EXAMINATION AND SEE IF THEY CAN RETRIEVE ANY DELETED FILES. IT SHOWS THE HYPOCRISY AND HOW THE DISINGENUOUS. WHEN THEY HAVE EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL MALFEASANCE AND THINGS GOING ON, THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. BUT THEN THEY TRIED TO CONJURE UP LIKE EVIL SPIRITS AN IDEA OF COLLUSION AND THEN SAY JUST LOOKING OUT FOR YOU, BUDDY. THEY PUT SOME ON YOUR CAMPAIGN, THEY ARE CHANGING THE STORY SAY NO, WE ARE TRYING TO PROTECT YOU. BUT WAIT, AND INFORMANT BUT NOT A SPY. VERBAL GYMNASTICS. Juan: NONE OF THIS CHANGES ANYTHING. Jesse: YOU DON'T THINK? Juan: I DON'T THINK IT CHANGES A BIT. WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH THE IDEA THAT RUSSIANS ARE TRYING TO INTERFERE IN THE CAMPAIGN. WE ARE WAITING TO FIND OUT WHAT MUELLER HAS. WHAT WE HAVE IS THE PRESIDENT AND HIS AIDES THROWING IT UP AND NOW Jesse: THIS WAS A LEAK FROM PEOPLE IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND "WASHINGTON POST" TO GET OUT AHEAD OF IT. I WILL TELL YOU WHY THERE IS SUSPICION, JUAN. LET ME FINISH. Juan: I HEREBY ORDER MY OWN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT? NOW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS A POLITICAL TOOL? Jesse: AND IT WAS NOT SUSPICIOUS UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, AP REPORTERS AND FOX REPORTERS WERE LOOKED INTO. CONGRESS WAS SURVEILLED. ALL OF A SUDDEN AND OPPOSING CAMPAIGN IS SURVEILLED AND EVERYONE IS SAYING OH, YOU KNOW WHAT. Kimberly: NO PROBLEM. Juan: WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? MUCH TO MY CHAGRIN BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE IT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER? LEAKS. LEAKS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP COMPLAINS ABOUT, LEAKS. THEY CRACKDOWN ON REPORTERS IN A WAY THAT I DON'T THINK IS LEGIT BUT THAT'S WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. Jesse: EVERYTHING THEY LEFT HAS SAID ABOUT THIS HAS BEEN
