OF AMERICANS PRETTY STRONGLY 
AGAINST THIS POLICY. 
THAT SAID, I THINK REPUBLICANS, 
YOU KNOW, WOULD LOVE TO MOVE ON 
FOR THE MOST PART AND TALK 
ABOUT PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING ELSE 
AT THIS POINT, I GUESS WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF MAYBE ROBERT 
MUELLER. 
BUT EVEN THAT I THINK KIND OF 
IS LESS UPSETTING  TO A LOT OF 
THE COUNTRY THAN THESE REPORTS 
FROM TEXAS. 
>> JAMES, THE PRESIDENT TODAY 
SAID HIS ACTION WAS PRE-EMPTIVE 
BUT WOULD BE BACKED BY 
LEGISLATION WHICH IS 
INTERESTING ON ANOTHER POINT 
BECAUSE HE WAS AGAINST D.A.C.A. 
APPARENT BECAUSE IT WAS AN 
EXECUTIVE ACTION BY PRESIDENT 
OBAMA, BUT THAT'S A SEPARATE 
ISSUE. 
THE HOUSE WILL VOTE AGAIN 
TOMORROW ON ANOTHER BILL, 
PREVIOUS REPUBLICAN EFFORTS TO 
PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION 
BILLS HAVE FAILED. 
SO WHAT MAKES THEM CONFIDENT 
THAT THEY CAN GET THROUGH? 
AND WHAT HAPPENS IF IT GETS TO 
THE SENATE? 
>> THEY'RE NOT CONFIDENT THAT 
THEY CAN GET THIS THROUGH. 
THEY CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE THE 
VOTES. 
AND THE MEETING WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S 
GOING TO BE SIGNING SOMETHING 
LATER TODAY, THAT WAS A MEETING 
WITH PEOPLE -- THE HOUSE 
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP GAVE A 
LIST TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
SAID THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO 
ARE ON THE FENCE, THESE ARE 
PEOPLE WHOSE VOTES WE NEED FOR 
THIS COMPROMISED IMMIGRATION 
BILL, OTHERWISE IT'S GOING TO 
FAIL. 
SO THE IDEA OF BRINGING TRUMP 
TO THE CAPITOL LAST NIGHT AND 
THEN BRINGING THOSE LAWMAKERS 
TO THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY WAS TO 
TRY AND TWIST SOME ARMS TO GET 
TO 218 VOTES WHICH IS HOW MANY 
THEY NEED TO PASS THE BILL. 
I THINK PAUL RYAN HAS PROMISED 
MODERATES THAT HE'S GOING TO 
BRING THE BILL UP FOR A VOTE, 
AN UP-OR-DOWN VOTE, WHETHER 
THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED 
TO GET IT TO PASS. 
AND SO THERE IS SOME CHANCE 
THAT IT COULD STILL GO DOWN. 
NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENED 
INTERESTINGLY WITH THIS ORDER, 
ALTHOUGH, AS I MENTIONED, IT'S 
NUANCED, IS THIS DOES TAKE SOME 
PRESSURE OFF CERTAIN LAWMAKERS 
WHO FELT LIKE THEY HAD TO VOTE 
FOR SOMETHING TO SHOW 
OPPOSITION TO FAMILY 
SEPARATION. 
NOW THEY WON'T FEEL THAT KIND 
OF SAME PRESSURE. 
AND IN SOME WAYS IT TAKES AWAY 
SOME OF THE LEVERAGE THAT THE 
WHITE HOUSE AND LEADERSHIP HAD 
TO GET CERTAIN REPUBLICANS TO 
VOTE FOR THE BILL TOMORROW. 
>> ABSOLUTLY. 
JAMES HOHMANN, THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR TIME. 
>> MY PLEASURE. 
>>>  AMERICAN AIRLINES IS 
TELLING THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO 
USE IT TO TRANSPORT IMMIGRANT 
CHILDREN TORN FROM THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
THE AIRLINE RELEASED A 
STATEMENT SAYING, QUOTE, THE 
FAMILY SEPARATION PROCESS THAT 
HAS BEEN WIDELY PUBLICIZED IS 
NOT AT ALL ALIGNED WITH THE 
VALUES OF AMERICAN AIRLINES. 
WE BRING FAMILIES TOGETHER, NOT 
APART. 
WE HAVE THEREFORE REQUESTED THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO 
IMMEDIATELY REFRAIN FROM USING 
AMERICAN FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
TRANSPORTING CHILDREN WHO HAVE 
BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE 
ASSOCIATED WITH SEPARATING 
FAMILIES OR WORSE, TO PROFIT 
FROM IT. 
>>>  THE CHILDREN WERE LIKELY 
BEING BOOKED ON SCHEDULED 
FLIGHTS AS REGULAR PASSENGERS. 
THEY ARE LIKELY AROUND 12 YEARS 
OLD AND UP. 
SOME REPORTS SAID THEY MAY HAVE 
BEEN AS YOUNG AS 6 YEARS OLD. 
AMERICAN AIRLINES DISPUTES 
THAT. 
>>> COMING UP AFTER A BREAK, 
THE PRESIDENT HEADS TO 
MINNESOTA FOR A RALLY. 
WE WILL LOOK AT WHY. 
>>>  PLUS TRAGEDY IN INDONESIA 
AFTER A FERRY SINKS WITH 
HUNDREDS ON BOARD. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>>  190 PEOPLE ARE PRESUMED 
DROWNED AFTER A FERRY SANK ON A 
SUMATRAN LAKE IN INDONESIA THIS 
WEEK. 
THE BOAT WAS FIVE TIMES OVER 
ITS PASSENGER CAPACITY OF 43 
AND EQUIPPED WITH ONLY 45 LIFE 
JACKETS. 
SO FAR ONLY 18 SURVIVORS HAVE 
BEEN FOUND. 
>>>  PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL HOLD 
TWO EVENTS IN MINNESOTA 
TONIGHT. 
HE WILL PARTICIPATE IN WHAT'S 
BEING BILLED AS A ROUNDTABLE ON 
PROTECTING AMERICAN WORKERS 
BEFORE HOLDING A CAMPAIGN-STYLE 
RALLY IN DULUTH. 
THE PRESIDENT LOST MINNESOTA TO 
HILLARY CLINTON IN 2016 BY 
NEARLY 45,000 VOTES. 
FOR MORE ON THIS, LET'S BRING 
IN MIKE MULCAHEY, THE POLITICAL 
EDITOR FOR MINNESOTA RADIO NEWS 
AND JOINS ME NOW FROM ST. PAUL, 
MINNESOTA. 
MIKE, THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. 
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT THE
