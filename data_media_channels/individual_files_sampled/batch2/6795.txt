it's easy to go after the National Rifle Association when the shootings happen in fact it's supposed to be easy the purpose of the NRA is to absorb whatever verbal or political punishment people dish out while the gun makers themselves continue to profit off the bloodshed the NRA is a lightning rod drawing our attention away from the companies and the human beings who make these weapons who advertise these weapons and who sell these weapons the gun used in last week's shooting in Parkman Florida was a semi-automatic rifle manufactured by Smith & Wesson but Smith & Wesson doesn't exist as a company anymore the name became a lightning rod and the company changed its name to American outdoor brands American outdoor brands is headquartered in Massachusetts and the CEO is this man 1 James Dabney the NRA in 2013 thanked him for his company's 1 million dollars in donations Dabney responded by thanking the NRA and explaining how necessary it was at the time because quote the whole Second Amendment is under attack as we speak I think it's important for everybody to step up and support the NRA they are our voice they're a single voice out there they're a united voice and they represent so many people and interested parties that I think is particularly important the whole second amendment is under attack as we speak at this very moment in time so I would say to everybody out there step up and join us now you may want to note this telling people that President Obama was coming for their guns inspired gun owners to buy more guns that came to a crashing end however with the election of Donald Trump no one thinks president Trump will do anything about guns so gun owners no longer feel the need to stock up which sent gun stocks down American out brands profits dropped 90% as Dabney said in December quote there is no fear based buying right now unquote but there is buying the largest single shareholder of American outdoor brands is the Blackrock hedge fund and Blackrock has been buying up American outdoor brands stock on the cheap in fact Blackrock is now the single largest owner of gunmaker stocks the CEO of Blackrock is this man Larry Fink last month faint made headlines with a letter telling CEOs their companies should serve a social purpose he stopped short however of telling him to stop making products that are dangerous in and of themselves coca-cola you tell me no more sugary drinks that's their business their businesses it providing how about no more tobacco products but we will not Sidhu that out last week the historic rifle maker Remington said it was filing for bankruptcy remington made the gun that was used to kill 26 children at Sandy Hook how ironic it would be if gun companies are forced out of business by men who helped elect a president who made gun owners feel safe enough to stop my guns but first we have to stop shoring up these companies by investing in them because if Congress will not act a new generation will turn its attention to the companies that control the money and the men who control the companies there is a new kind of storm rising in parkland and all around the country and lightning rods do not stand forever
