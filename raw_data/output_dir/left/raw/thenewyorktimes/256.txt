1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,900
If you look at the delete
Facebook hashtag, people

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,960
are really angry.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,630
And I think they’re
sort of becoming

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,670
aware of the extent
to which they’re

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,470
being watched and tracked.

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,220
This feels like it’s a turning
point for many of the people

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,830
who use Facebook and
aren’t happy about how

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,120
their data is being used.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,520
And the more they find out,
the less happy they are.

10
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:24,890
I think people
underestimate how hard

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,032
it is to untangle ourselves from
a social network like Facebook.

12
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,990
So before you delete your
Facebook account, just

13
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,060
remember that it’s not
just Facebook that you’ll

14
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,590
be losing access to.

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,170
It’s also all of
the third-party apps

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,930
that you use
Facebook to log in to

17
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,050
or that are connected or plugged
into your Facebook account.

18
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,550
So it’s important
before you make

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,280
this choice to go
through those apps,

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,740
see which ones you
still need access to,

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,860
and if there are any, to switch
your login from Facebook

22
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,420
to something else.

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,310
So you can still access
it even after you’ve

24
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,960
deleted your Facebook account.

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,450
And there are just some apps
that you won’t have access

26
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,021
to if you delete your
Facebook account.

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,170
Facebook has a lot of ways
to track your activity

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,950
even if you’re not logged in
or if you delete your account

29
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,690
entirely, and it uses what
it calls the social graph

30
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,720
to track the activity of
people across the internet

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,810
beyond just Facebook.com.

32
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,770
This accounts for everyone
who uses the internet,

33
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,930
and you don’t have to have
a Facebook profile to be

34
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,100
tracked by Facebook.

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,160
For example, if your
friends have Facebook

36
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,020
accounts or Facebook
Messenger accounts

37
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,500
and if they’ve uploaded
their contacts to Facebook

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,440
and if you’re one of
their contacts, then

39
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,410
Facebook knows your name
and your phone number

40
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:51,830
and can track you. When
you deactivate or delete

41
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,980
your Facebook profile,
your profile disappears

42
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,310
and people can’t see what
you posted or search for you.

43
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,640
But all of the data that you
gave over to third-party app

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,900
developers is still out there.

45
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,410
And those developers
are not required

46
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,870
to delete it or do
anything with it.

47
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,508
They can use it
however they want.

48
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:12,540
For as long as they want.

49
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,440
There’s a whole list of ways
that Facebook will track you

50
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,850
outside of Facebook.com. To do
the full cleanse, you would have

51
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,630
to actually manually block
a list of URLs that they

52
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,710
use to track you.

53
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,650
These are the lengths you’d have
to go to if you truly wanted

54
00:02:27,650 --> 00:00:00,000
to get off of Facebook’s grid.
