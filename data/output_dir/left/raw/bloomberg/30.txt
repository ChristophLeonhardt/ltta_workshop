1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,183
(dreamy music)

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,303
This is Bertie.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,330
He might look like any other cow,

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,240
but there's one little thing about him

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,033
that sets him apart from his breed.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,713
Bertie has never grown a pair of horns.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,063
And that wasn't a fluke of nature.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,283
Parts of his DNA were
rewritten by this man.

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,610
Using new tools in gene editing,

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,330
scientists like him are
gaining unprecedented control

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,963
over the fate of all living things.

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,220
As technology replaces old jobs,

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,690
it's also creating new ones.

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,340
I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,503
to show you the jobs of the future.

16
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:55,618
(upbeat music)

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,860
My name is Dan Carlson
and I'm a gene editor.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,230
Buckle up.

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,790
The field is changing almost by the day,

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,790
so new innovations, new techniques,
gene-editing technology,

21
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,603
it's just gonna improve our
lives in a number of ways.

22
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,320
Dan works for a biotech
startup called Recombinetics

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,430
here in St. Paul, Minnesota.

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,580
So this is the embryology lab.

25
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,740
He's tackling a problem

26
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,223
that's plagued farmers for generations.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,130
Most dairy cattle are born with horns,

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,730
which they can use to hurt each other

29
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,263
and their human handlers.

30
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,890
Because of that, worldwide,
farmers remove horns

31
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,130
from millions of dairy calves each year.

32
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,263
It's a painful and distressing
process for the animals.

33
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,230
Dan wants cows to be born hornless

34
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,703
and hopes to eliminate the
practice of dehorning altogether.

35
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,980
What we can do on this
microscope here is take the cells

36
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,283
that we've engineered and
create embryos out of those.

37
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:15,111
(playful music)

38
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,210
You might think of Dan as some kind

39
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,643
of mad scientist,

40
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,150
but he's really the most
wholesome guy you could imagine.

41
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,356
He's an excellent maker of hamburgers.

42
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,841
Which one do you want, Ethan?

43
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:31,750
I want the tastiest one.

44
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,125
He's a husband to this lovely woman.

45
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,170
You have to eat some of your pizza, bud.

46
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,840
And a dad to three adorable kids.

47
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,781
Lilly, do you know what your
dad does at work every day?

48
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:42,750
He works.

49
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,760
He works?

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,240
Do you know what he does?

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,033
He kills pigs?

52
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:47,933
I do what?

53
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,210
To be clear, one of Dan's other projects

54
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,363
involves editing the genes of pigs.

55
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,677
In case you were wondering.

56
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:05,630
(tranquil guitar music)

57
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,550
Dan's passion for farm animals stems

58
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,413
from his childhood
growing up on this farm.

59
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,280
It's run by his dad, who
has a very fitting name.

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,393
This farm here is where my
dad started out farming.

61
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,623
I never dreamt that Dan
would be a scientist.

62
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,600
In high school, it was the time

63
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,360
where the genetically modified crops

64
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,810
were beginning to be planted.

65
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,823
And my dad was one of the early adopters.

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,443
You could see the difference
in the crops immediately.

67
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,400
They were taller.

68
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,790
They didn't have any problems standing up.

69
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,200
And from that moment on,

70
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,230
I was like this technology is for real.

71
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,830
It can really make a difference.

72
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,140
Gene editing themselves is
kind of science fiction to me,

73
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,630
but I'm very proud of
the work that Dan does.

74
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,200
I think they were hungry.

75
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,220
For Darwin, dehorning
cattle has always been

76
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,420
his least favorite part of the job.

77
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,750
When they get their horns cut
off, they holler like crazy,

78
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,570
so you know that it
ain't a comfortable thing

79
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,820
that's happening to them.

80
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,213
There are cows that
naturally never grow horns,

81
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,809
but they're usually used for beef.

82
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,403
They can't produce enough
milk for dairy farmers.

83
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,370
So six years ago, Dan started working

84
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,960
on developing hornless dairy cattle.

85
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,000
I was interested in trying to solve some

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,090
of the problems that my dad encountered.

87
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,540
Using a gene-editing tool

88
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,400
that was discovered
less than a decade ago,

89
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,710
Dan's team took a dairy cow's cell,

90
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,230
cut out the genetic segment
that makes the animal grow horns

91
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,690
and then swapped in a sequence found

92
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,780
in some beef cattle that
makes them hornless.

93
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,180
Next, his team created an
embryo from the edited cell

94
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,870
and inserted it into a surrogate mother.

95
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,440
Then, they waited for
nine nerve-racking months.

96
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,640
You're expecting it to
come out without any horns

97
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,343
or horn buds but you just don't know.

98
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,550
Bertie, the world's first
cow to be gene edited

99
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,293
for hornlessness was born in 2015 in Iowa.

100
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
Shortly after, he was transferred here

101
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,100
to the University of California at Davis.

102
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,423
He's incredibly strong.

103
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,240
I can see why it would be
dangerous to have horns on him.

104
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,170
No, that's right.

105
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,940
They kind of use their
head as their defense.

106
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,610
It's natural for them to do that,

107
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,790
and obviously when you
have a 1,500 pound animal

108
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,230
moving his head around like that,

109
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,843
it doesn't take much to do
some pretty significant damage.

110
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,550
Bertie became a dad to
six calves in the fall.

111
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,230
All of them inherited their
father's lack of horns,

112
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,960
and one of them happens to be female.

113
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,340
In a few years, she's gonna
be old enough to produce milk,

114
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,390
which scientists are planning to examine.

115
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,170
Nolan, do you like cows?

116
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,240
I love them.

117
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,780
I love their babies the most.

118
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,730
Who likes yogurt?

119
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,190
Who likes milk shakes?

120
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,023
Me.

121
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,860
Would you let your kids drink the milk

122
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,180
of a gene-edited cow?

123
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,490
Of course.
Yeah?

124
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,323
Yeah.
You wouldn't be--

125
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:21,193
I would purposely buy it
if it was on the market.

126
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,990
Biologists are now pouring

127
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,920
into the field of gene editing,

128
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,850
coming out with new
applications at dizzying speeds.

129
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,720
If it all goes according to plan,

130
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,540
much of it will change
our lives for the better.

131
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,600
But will there be unintended consequences?

132
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,210
And how much tinkering
with nature is too much?

133
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,583
Oh, you're getting some kisses.

134
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,800
Our answers will shape the future

135
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,660
of Dan's profession.

136
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,780
Whether this strain of animals takes off,

137
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,410
it's really up to the government
and public acceptance.

138
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,850
I can't go a lot about those things.

139
00:07:02,850 --> 00:00:00,000
I just gotta do my job.
