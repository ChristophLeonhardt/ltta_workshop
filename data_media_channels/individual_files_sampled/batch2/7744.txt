TYT is partnering with participant media to help solve the climate crisis will not be great now look you got to check out our series 10 days of action to learn more about what you can do to make a difference and go see an inconvenient sequel truth to power in theaters in New York and LA on July 28th and nationwide August 4th when it comes to the immigration debate in the United States oftentimes those who are here without citizenship status are those who are painted as criminals or the bad guys but a recent investigative report by The Associated Press indicates that there's a church in North Carolina that purposely traffics humans from Brazil with the sole intent of using them as slaves slave labor now this is the world of faith fellowship and it used its to church branches in Latin America's largest nation to siphon a steady flow of young laborers who come on tourist and student visas to its 35-acre compound now this church was started by a woman by the name of Jane Whaley and according to dozens of people that The Associated Press spoke to she has done terrible things and has threatened individuals who have said that they would speak out against the type of slave slave labor that they've been victimized by so one individual who has experienced this firsthand says they trafficked us up here they knew what they were doing they needed labor and we were cheap labor hell free labor so they did not get paid the men and and young boys in some cases who were brought from Brazil had to do tough labor construction jobs they had to work on the homes of some of the officials that worked for the church and then the young girls who were brought here were forced to work hours on and taking care of children babysitting things like that so this was actually something that was tipped off to police years ago in 2014 3 X congregants told an assistant US attorney that the Brazilians were being forced to work for no pay and I don't know what happened or whether or not there was an investigation but what I do know is that nothing was really done there was no outcome of of that effort to draw attention to this issue also they beat up anyone who tries to raise concerns or speak out about the treatment that they're facing one other person says most definitely one of the former congregants responded ministers mostly bring them up here for free work another set the most definitely was in response to whether they were beaten right so let's review this they capture you and you you can't go anywhere because they took in the relationship to our Kelly story if you remember from a week ago I said don't let anybody take your phone and don't want anybody take your passport because what they're trying to do is control you and so in our Kelly's case it was the phones in this case is the passports so they can't go any they literally can't go anywhere and so a lot of them didn't even speak English they get brought up and it's made to work for 15 hour days as young as when they are 12 yes and when you involve physical beatings well that's the definition of slavery where you're captured you're not allowed to go anywhere and you're beaten and made to work for free so and it's done under the guise of a church look it's it gets I mean it gets so much worse there were arranged marriages I want to give you guys as many details as possible but I highly recommend that you read the full report will include a link in the description box below based on exclusive interviews with forty-three former members documents and secretly made recordings The Associated Press reported in February that congregants were regularly punched smacked and choked in an effort to purify sinners by beating out devils so what are some of the things that they got beaten for here's an example anyone in the bathroom for more than the mandated five minutes was suspected of committing the sin of masturbation and Whaley would be called to the house to decree the punishment and they would literally beat these victims up to get the devil out of them or to beat the sin out of them if any of the males appear to be having an impure thought Barbosa said everybody would be awakened ordered to surround him and repeatedly shake him and shriek into his ears to expel the devil's a Word of Faith practice called blastings thus if they thought he was I mean impure dream how do you what kind of dream he's having this is insane and they were you know they were living in you know unsafe conditions several people dozens of people crammed in in a basement it's just sick and they were told all sorts of things all sorts of promises before coming here to the US you know you're gonna come and you're gonna see the US we're gonna allow you to go to school but then they would overwork these kids to the point where they they didn't have an opportunity to study or go to school at all so look in the old days we were told to respect authority figures now it's not right to go completely in the opposite direction and say don't have a respect any authority figure so that's crazy but we have learned that we have to be a lot more careful some people use their position of power to oppress other people and for their own enjoyment pleasure benefit etc so how many stories you have to see before you get that through your head because it's a church if you automatically trust it you're nuts so that doesn't mean you shouldn't trust any Church know there's some wonderful churches out there lots of wonderful religious organizations and plenty of terrible ones but if you say no but wait I have faith well these kids had faith their parents had faith when they sent them to North Carolina and they got sign up for modern-day slavery you cannot have faith without reason because how else would you know what to put your faith in so when you are assessing something just because the religious organization doesn't mean it is exempt from reason or how you would normally judge a situation and it's and it's whether it's safe not safe productive helpful or not any of those things and yes I got bad news for you many religious organizations do the most horrific things why think about it it's like why do the foot fetish guys become shoe salesmen why do the child molesters become sometimes unfortunately coaches or priests because they've got it ready in it it they've got marks there that they considered to be easy marks right and so they think Oh kids the their parents trusted them with me and they told them to put their complete trust in me now in a church what are you told all the time don't question what was a forbidden fruit that they ate in in Genesis they ate from the tree of knowledge and that's what got them kicked out of Eden they tell you don't believe in knowledge don't don't think for yourself just this is the dogma of the book have faith in it and whoever is up on that pulpit trusts them a hundred percent when you do that this result in some instances is guaranteed power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely and if you give blind faith and allegiance there's an excellent chance terrible things will happen right and you know these kids weren't able to communicate with their parents because their phones were taken away and there were arranged marriages because the church had more women than men and so some of the some of the men that were brought from Brazil were essentially forced to marry some of the women who weren't married yet it's just insane and the fact that authorities had learned about what was really going on years ago and nothing happened is concerning to say the least but I'm grateful that The Associated Press stayed on this story and and you know uncovered what's really going on and look church is getting a free ride in a thousand different ways yeah you know and look all the religions do it parts of Islam of course they do it look at what the Taliban does to young boys hustling our boys and and it's just grotesque what happens it happens in Hinduism it happens in Judaism it happens in all the religions but in heavily Christian North Carolina if it's a Christian group doing it well do you really want to go after a church that might be politically disadvantageous so let him do what keep doing whatever they're doing even though it is horrific thank you Associated Press that's great journalism thank you for exposing it so they could put an end to it if you liked this video you probably like independent media the best way to support independent media become a member of the
