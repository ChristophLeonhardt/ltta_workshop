it's day 9 of testimony at the sexual-assault trial of Syrian refugee suleiman hajj suleman at the edmonton law courts I am still the lone reporter in the courtroom so you'll hear details for me that you won't see anywhere else Haj Solomon is accused of six counts of sexual assault and six counts of sexual interference on six girls all under the age of 16 the charges against him stemmed from a series of gropings fondling Zand assaults that took place during the evening of February 4 2017 at Edmonton's world waterpark wave pool trial has been fraught with delays because the accused claims require full English to Arabic word for word translation today the accused has four supporters in the courtroom with him two men who don't seem to know the child victims nor do they seem to know each other are in the courtroom today to support the girls court opened today with the testimony of a completely unrelated bystander to the incident a man who tried to be a good Samaritan on the night of February 4th 2017 this man was at the water park with his family including his two granddaughters aged three and two and one of his older daughters who was 18 at the time the man said that while he was in the wave pool he noticed another man acting and I quote a little strange the witness said he noticed that man putting his goggles on his head and staring straight ahead at a group of girls the witness described this man as someone with dark skin dark hair a beard blue swimming trunks swimming goggles of average height and build the witness said that when the waves came the accused ducked under the waves and stared straight ahead at five or six girls the witness described as aged 15 to 18 and the witness said and I quote it seemed very odd what he was doing I looked at the girls and they seemed very concerned the witness said he made eye contact with one of the girls motioning for them to move closer towards him the girls did but the accused followed them anyway the witness then said he did not speak to the girls but he told the court what was happening looked very inappropriate and that and I quote as a father all my dad feelings were that something was not right today's witness reported the odd behavior to a lifeguard at approximately 8:30 or 9:00 p.m. that night today's witness also noted that he saw security and police meet with the very same man and escorted him out of the water park at close at 10:30 that night the witness told defense under cross-examination that he would have liked to have seen the accused removed from the pool when he first complained earlier in the evening the defense also focused on the fact that today's witness despite describing the accused in the very same way as nearly every other witness to take the stand that he wasn't wearing his eyeglasses when trial resumes this afternoon we're expected to hear from two supervisory lifeguards from the water park who worked very closely with mall security to remain in visual contact with the accused reporting from the Edmonton law courts I'm Sheila Gunn read for the rebel dot media I'm reporting from the Edmonton law courts I'm covering the Syrian refugee water park sexual assault trial to never miss an important update to this terrible story become a rebel subscriber today you
