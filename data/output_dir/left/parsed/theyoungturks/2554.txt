DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS
SUCCEEDED IN PASSING TAX
CUTS BUT THOSE TAX CUTS DO COST
QUITE A BIT AND THEY HAVE
TO MAKE UP FOR THE HUGE BREAK
THAT THE WEALTHY AND
CORPORATIONS ARE GETTING THROUGH
THIS NEW TAX LAW.
ONE WAY THAT THEY HAVE DONE IT
IS THEY HAVE GOTTEN RID OF
CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS.
ALIMONY WAS SOMETHING THAT
PEOPLE WHO HAD JUST GOTTEN A
DIVORCE COULD DEDUCT FROM THEIR
TAXES BUT LITTLE KNOWN FACT IS
THAT THIS NEW TAX PLAN ACTUALLY
GETS RID OF THAT DEDUCTION AND
IT IS GOING TO LEAD TO
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS FOR
DIVORCING COUPLES, WHICH IS WHY
RIGHT NOW DIVORCE LAWYERS ARE
URGING PEOPLE TO GET THROUGH
THEIR DIVORCE AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE BEFORE THIS PORTION OF
THE LAW KICKS IN 
IN 2019.
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.
SO THEY GET TO DEDUCT A PORTION
OF IT, MEANING THAT THEY
DON'T ACTUALLY SPEND THE ENTIRE
AMOUNT ON ALIMONY.
ALSO, PREVIOUSLY THE INDIVIDUAL
RECEIVING THE ALIMONY
PAYMENTS WOULD HAVE TO PAY TAXES
ON THAT INCOME.
UNDER THIS NEW TAX PLAN, NO,
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WHICH IS
REALLY STRANGE.
BUT THAT IS EARNED INCOME.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU GET TAXED ON IT
BUT THE PERSON WHO IS GIVING IT
TO YOU DOESN'T GET TO USE THAT
MONEY, THEY GIVE IT RIGHT TO THE
OTHER PERSON BUT THEY GET TAXED
ON IT.
IT'S WEIRD AND ONE OF THE
THINGS, I THINK IT MAKES SENSE
TO DEDUCT IT AND THE REASON FOR
THAT IS YOU DO ACTUALLY HAVE TO
PAY IT AND ONCE YOU PAY IT THAT
IS MONEY YOU DO NOT HAVE
ENHANCED LESS MONEY YOU MADE
THAT YEAR IN A SENSE BUT NOW
THEY ARE SAYING NO, YOU ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO DEDUCT IT SOLD
COURSE YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN.
THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE WILL
OFFER LESSON IN ALIMONY.
IF THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE
ACTUALLY PAYING $.60
ON THE DOLLAR THEY CAN AFFORD TO
OFFER MORE.
THAT IS WHAT DIFFERENT DIVORCE
LAWYERS ARE PANICKING RIGHT NOW.
YOU CAN SAY NO BIG DEAL, THAT IS
JUST WHAT IS HAPPENING AND
IT'S OUR JOB TO REPORT IT AND IT
WILL CERTAINLY AFFECT THOSE
ALIMONY PAYMENTS AND YES, NOW
PEOPLE WILL PAY LESS
BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.
TO ME THERE IS A BIGGER ISSUE
ABOUT TEXAS OVERALL THAT WE
WILL GET TO IN A SECOND BUT I
WANT TO CONVEY TO YOU THE
SENSE OF PANIC WHICH I'M
SLIGHTLY AMUSED BY.
THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE AMERICAN
BAR ASSOCIATION SECTION ON
FAMILY
LIFE SAYS:
I LOVE THE QUOTES IN THE
ARTICLE, BUT ALSO, I LEARNED SO
MUCH ABOUT DIVORCES THAT I DID
NOT LOOK INTO EVER AND, IT
DOESN'T MATTER, I'M SURE IT WILL
NEVER AFFECT ME.
CALIFORNIA.
CALIFORNIA HAS TO CHILL OUT WITH
ALL THIS DIVORCE STUFF.
DID YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA YOU
CANNOT GET DIVORCED WITHIN
A WEEK OR A MONTH?
THERE'S LIKE A SIX-MONTH
PERIOD THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT
BEFORE YOUR ARE FINALLY
OFFICIALLY DIVORCED.
IT'S CALLED A COOLING-OFF
PHASE.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.
AND THERE ARE COOLING-OFF
PERIODS IN
OTHER STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA
WHERE IS ACTUALLY LONGER,
YOU HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR.
THAT IS WHY DIVORCE LAWYERS ARE
PANICKING NOW,
ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE
THERE ARE SOME HIGH DOLLAR
DIVORCES AND THEY ARE LIKELY,
YOU DO NOT GET IT, YOU HAVE TO
SAY YOU'RE GETTING DIVORCED, THE
OTHER SIDE HAS TO AGREE, THERE
ARE ALL THESE THINGS AND THEN
YOU HAVE TO WAIT SIX MONTHS.
THEY'RE TELLING ALL OF THEIR
CLIENTS, IF YOU ARE
SLIGHTLY UPSET IN YOUR
MARRIAGE, GET DIVORCED NOW.
IT IS KIND OF CRAZY.
BY THE WAY, PARTY OF FAMILY
VALUES.
SO NOW THE LARGER POINT ABOUT
TAXES OVERALL.
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
THEY ARE GIVING A GIANT TAX CUT
TO CORPORATIONS.
THEY HAVE TO GET IT FROM
SOMEWHERE.
WHEN A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN
WAS ASKED ON TELEVISION CAN
YOU NAME ONE CORPORATE LOOPHOLE
THAT YOU GUYS TOOK AWAY?
HE COULDN'T NAME ONE.
WHEN IT COMES TO LOOPHOLES FOR
YOU GUYS OR I WOULD ARGUE,
IT'S NOT A LOOPHOLE, LOGICAL
DEDUCTION, NO, FOR THE
REGULAR PERSON WE'RE TAKING IT
AWAY SO THEY HAD TO GET THE
MONEY FROM SOMEWHERE.
THEY STILL HAVE ONE AND A HALF
TRILLION DOLLAR EXTRA
DEFICIT THAT THEY CREATED BUT
LIKE I TOLD YOU, THAT IS
NOT THE ONLY MONEY.
THE REALITY OF THE TAX CUTS FOR
THE RICH AND CORPORATIONS,
IT'S ABOUT 6 TRILLION SO THE
OTHER FOR NATURALLY HAD TO
COME FROM SOMEWHERE AND WHERE
DOES IT COME FROM?
YOU.
THEY TOOK AWAY YOUR DEDUCTIONS
BUT TOOK AWAY NONE OF THE
LOOPHOLES FOR CORPORATIONS THAT
WHEN A PERSON IS ABOUT TAX
REFORM THEY SAID IT IS NOT A TAX
CUT, TAX REFORM.
WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF THE
LOOPHOLE SO CORPORATIONS
CANNOT SHEET AND THEN LOWER
THEIR RATES.
AND ALSO KEEP IN MIND HOW
THEY SELL THE WAY THAT THEY
GOT RID OF ALL OF THESE
DEDUCTIONS.
WE ARE TRYING TO SIMPLIFY THE
TAX CODE, IT IS TOO
COMPLICATED TO GIVE THE MIDDLE
COUNT CLASS AND THE WORKING
CLASS ANY DEDUCTIONS.
THE CORPORATIONS CAN KEEP
THEIR DEDUCTIONS AND THEIR
LOOPHOLES, THAT IS NOT LOOP
COMPLICATED.
THE DUTCH SANDWICH AND IRISH
DOUBLE, WHATEVER THEY ARE
CALLED, THERE THESE CRAZY TAX
LOOPHOLES, THEY ALL STILL EXIST.
THEY ARE NORMATIVELY, LOCATED,
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO CREATE
THE JOBS.
HIGH-PAYING JOBS.
SURE.
BY THE WAY, HOW IS THAT MARKET
WORKING OUT FOR YOU GUYS?
TRUMP IS NOT BRAGGING ABOUT THE
STOCK MARKET TODAY, IS HE?
OOPS.
