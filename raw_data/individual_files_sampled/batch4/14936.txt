first up there's a question you made reference to not cutting any jobs at Toronto City Hall when you made the billion dollars in savings yeah so are you gonna not cut any jobs in the province and still save money yeah we're gonna save money just like we did what are you gonna cut any job no I don't believe we need to cut any jobs I don't believe in taking food off people's table we're gonna find efficiencies drivers efficiencies and that's how we're gonna save the money just like we did in the City of Toronto no given that a large percentage of the provincial budget is about paying salaries how do you save money without cutting jobs I don't get it I know because you've never done it before I have that's the difference thank you next question mr. Ford you said that Ontario needs tax incentives to attract businesses to come here that's broke and in just about the next breath you said you're dead set against corporate welfare can you draw a distinction between corporate welfare is giving bombardier a billion dollars a few years later another billion another bill I'm not I don't believe in that but giving a tax incentive is encouraging companies here and giving a tax incentive to open up in certain regions if they they're up north I'd be more than happy Procter & Gamble's leave in Brockville if Procter & Gamble came up to me and said what sort of taxes can we save we'd come up with a great plan to keep Procter & Gamble up there there's gonna be 300 families without a job up there that's huge absolutely huge just to be sure I understand you would if companies came to you and said we're gonna have to leave unless we get some sort of a tax cut we would look at not only that I want to attract new companies to do you know what I love down in the US do you see what's happening down there they said manufacturing jobs will never come back they're coming back by the droves now they have the lowest unemployment this is who were competing against they're giving tax incentives every single couple every couple weeks from a certain state oh I'll get a letter from the Chamber Commerce from the state itself saying here come to Texas we'll help you we even with a building will even help you hire people as long as you come here and employ people my point was my friend is we have to be business friendly here we are not business friendly we have layers and layers of red tape and bureaucracy that we have to cut we have to get rid of we have to make sure that businesses thrive in Ontario we don't tax them to get at the death and a lot of it yes I agree is municipal taxes municipal we got the highest hydro rates we have this carbon tax that's done so just look at the hydro rates and the carbon tax alone the job killers absolute job killers we're getting rid of the carbon tax for loan hydro rates next question last question hey just curious in the Toronto or the GTA area in certain pockets the Ford nation brand is very strong very powerful I'm just curious how does the four nation brand resonate outside of the GTA based on your experience thus far well good good question David I'll tell ya it's it's overwhelming I said that before I went there before I even ran I used to travel around Ontario the rural areas it resonates a lot more than even the four one six every single location we go to standing-room-only no no no matter if it's 7:30 in the morning in Peterborough when we had a packed house or London was standing room only or brought filler Belleville everywhere we're going last night in Sudbury we just drove all night from Sudbury there was packed packed and the local organizers have said Doug without a lot of mp's a lot of MP pees a lot of leaders no one has ever packed a room like this but what's more an entry more interesting than that David what's more interesting are people coming up up to me everywhere we go saying I'm a lifelong NDP I'm not doing the PC party via PC I'm joining the party because of you everywhere I go I've been lifelong liberal I'm joining the party because of you I've never voted before my entire life but you give us you give us hope you give us hope here in Ontario this is gonna be the first time I've ever voted in France and another question um if you prevail as leader you'll certainly be going up against the wind Liberals and the NDP but I'm curious what your strategy will be based on the experience of what your late brother went through as mayor of Toronto when dealing with the media party if you will the way your brother was treated by the media I thought was you know off the scales a new benchmark what is your strategy because you know they will be coming for you well David I'm the only one that will stand up to the establishment I'm the only one that will stand up to the elites the political elites and the political insiders that have been raking the taxpayers over the coals for years I'm the only one that will challenge the liberal media and we know enough don't get me wrong not all the media are bad media but I will stand up to the liberal media that has dictated policies and influence politicians for 60 years in this province in the city I will stand up to that we are going to base policies on what the media says especially the liberal media we're gonna make sure we have policies that are beneficial to all Ontario residents and what they want it's gonna be what they want not with the media Prince anyways I appreciate everyone coming tonight and we look forward to seeing you in the future thank you he folks have you heard the news the rebel has a brand new app download that app and take the rebel wherever you go you
