well I think this qualifies as the very definition of irony there was to be a seminar called the stifling of free speech on university campuses and guess what it couldn't be held at a university campus evidently just talking about free speech is simply too offensive for some of the snowflakes and social justice warriors out there good thing that the people at Canada Christian College they stepped in they offered a venue and the likes of jordan peterson dr. oren amat a and god's odd are speaking right now to a packed audience of more than 1,500 people and we're gonna talk to some of the attendees exiting the venue right now and find out what they think has to be done in order to reclaim freedom of speech and freedom of expression on campus what do you think has to be done in order to reclaim freedom of speech on campus I think first of all I in my opinion Canadian people have to really acknowledge and appreciate what what they have and they are losing free speech needs to be it needs to be a part of our society and the more of them that come and see this and take it away and bring it out to their families or friends it's it's so logical it feels almost embarrassing that you have to have this sort of a meeting do you think that's part of the tragedy of the political correctness movement on campus as dr. Peterson said it's not a matter of there's huge numbers behind this it's really a very vocal minority so if the majority does stand up chances are you'll get your way don't you think well absolutely like they said you know the squeaky wheels always get the grease right so I think it's definitely a vocal minority but the problem is they're they're extremely vocal whereas the people who are standing up for these things are not vocal at this point so you know they're losing out to this bigger movement to be honest with you we're in Canada were in one of the best countries in the world we've got it made right we have all the the privileges that the rest of the world wish they have so you know you have a good life you know even if you're poor in Canada you have you're one of the richest people in the world so do you really want to risk what you have to to just to say no that's wrong no people should be allowed to speak their minds what does that get you really it's so easy to not be not speak your mind and just shut up and live your life and just have have have your your ordinary life but but these guys who spoke today GAD said Professor dr. Emmett a and Jordan Peterson they showed me their their courage that if they can do it they're inspiring me to do it too so I think just people need to be more courageous and just speak up when they say do you know what this doesn't feel right this isn't something that I think there's a value for Canada as long as people are afraid of speaking openly and bring discussions and ideas to to to look at them from all the sides we'll be in the travel because the regressive left gonna win if we're not going to resist that so stand up to the leftist and the marches out there that are trying to take away our freedoms absolutely my wife just went through a white guilt shaming session in her education program where they had an Aboriginal speaker come in and basically berate everyone for an hour about how they stole the land and they should all collectively apologize and have a good cry with with a peace blanket in the classroom setting that mandatory to as far as I know that was part of the class and they all had to go so you know that's the that's the animal that's out there that we're dealing with I know dr. Jordan Peterson said he thinks were at a point where things are going to either go spectacularly good in terms of a backlash or spectacularly bad in terms of more of this PC madness taking over I guess your for you the glass is half-empty yeah it's happened I I'm of the opinion that we need a total collapse and to set the natural order back it back in line because people you know unless people are starving and you know trying to feed themselves and trying to survive they can't be bothered with you know the whatever that bothers the left nowadays the the the language that seems to offend them Euripides wrote back in the third century in a play that if a man isn't free to speak his mind he is a slave I think that is extremely pressing to what's going on right now I just want you to take the ideas that they gave you those same opinions and just do it back to them in written form so they know oh now you're ideologically pure we've done our job it's not educating it's just giving you opinions giving you words and hoping that you repeat them back well folks in one respect there was a quasi happy ending to the radicals on campus shutting down the freedom of speech on-campus seminar that was originally to take place at Ryerson namely the venue was about 500 seats well that forced the organizers to go to this venue which had 1,500 seat capacity and every ticket was sold so in other words the anti his free speech thugs all they ended up doing was multiplying the audience by a factor of three well done for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's Lloyd Menzies like what you just saw then click subscribe below and never miss another rebel video you
