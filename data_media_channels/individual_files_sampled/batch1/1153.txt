hi I'm Molly Kabul and you're in the stream live on al-jazeera and YouTube today India's forbidden love before we start take a look at this clip of a young woman named Koh Celia telling the story of how she met her husband Shanker for the first time um you know well open everyone happy not asleep little college party lover on my liver and principal in the party anarchy in the pathology Primavera pion : a poem was it sadi or a fully deployed sadly Kausalya and Shanker's marriage ended in tragedy in early 2016 the couple were attacked by a group of men as they walked home from a shopping trip they were beaten and hacked at with long knives on a crowded Street causing horrific injuries Coase alia survived Shankar did not.we attack a so-called honour killing was carried out because Shankar was adalat seen as a lower caste to the one cosa Lia comes from eleven people were charged over the attack including cosa Leah's parents and in a trial that gripped India she testified against her own mother and father as they faced the death penalty the case raised uncomfortable questions about social stratification crimes of honour and the status of women in Indian society so joining us to discuss Cynthia Steven is a Dalit social policy researcher analysts and journalists in London sadhana Subramanyam is the director of India's forbidden love an honor killing on trial that's an Al Jazeera witness film that followed Kausalya as she fought for justice through the courts and in tonight Maharaja Shan muga Sundaram is a lawyer and spokesman for the Opposition DMK party welcome to this dream everyone no sudden I want to start with you because you first came across that CCTV footage of the attack two years ago what was it about this incident that spoke to you as a filmmaker so I saw the CCTV footage on Facebook and the first thing the most noticeable thing except for the brutal crime of course was the fact that this was happening in broad daylight this wasn't an isolated incident somewhere happening in remote corners this was happening right in center of the city and that's what stuck to me the most and and I learned that there were the girls survived then that led me to make a film about it so Cynthia you know we heard that this happened in broad daylight and it's seeing the footage and seeing people come up behind them which people will see in the film is so shocking but how rare is it to see an attack like this of this magnitude and in this public of a view I think honor killings have the so-called honor killings have been a part of the scene for many years in India Tamil Nadu has been particularly bad and while researching this to write about it for a major Indian newspaper I found that there have been 80 other cases earlier so it is not unknown the particular the difference between this incident and the others of course was it we had footage on CCTV because it happened in a public street the other part is that the girl was also attacked normally what happens is that the the two are separated and whatever happens happens to them individually so these are the two things that you miss right right when we talk about what makes this unique manner Ashish I pulled up this tweet here this is from Garrosh Nair he says here in India he beans the ease of reporting remains a mirage try walking into a police station to report a simple crime try calling the police there are those who may have had good experiences but that's very difficult to stay confident we're largely a police fearing and hating society and there's a long way ahead some entourage we talk about what makes this case unique is it the fact that there was a prosecution is it the fact that Co salia testified against her own parents or is it the fact that according to the street it's difficult to even report crimes like this in the first place well this is what makes honor the so called honor crimes quite a complex issue let's let's separate what the tweet is raised to the tweet that we just read out speaks about reporting crimes honor killing complexity of the issue is not in the reporting stage itself in my opinion with regard to honor killings the complexity goes up 10 times as much when it comes to the actual trials now as you know the so called honor killings happened when a family feels that they have so-called communal honor has been taken away because there has been a relationship or a marriage that has happened across two different caste groups now when such a crime takes place it is often the parents of the other close relatives or members of the extended family of friends who are involved and more often than not the the survivor the victims of the honor cry rarely ever go and testify against them which is why we found in Tamil Nadu in the state of Tamil Nadu in the last five to seven years there's been around 80 to 90 such honor crimes yet this is the first conviction of sorts and and across India - this is not a phenomena that is restricted to one state or one region across India there's this in the vicinity of around 5,000 on crimes and even in Pakistan in our in our immediate neighborhood there's been around thousand honor crimes so what is this on a crime I mean it is not just a simple issue where there is a resentment that there is someone marrying or or there is a relationship across caste groups it also is a particular form of gender-based violence it is when the family feels that the woman especially marries someone below the cast group if you invert that if there is a man sorry to interrupt there but just going to what we were talking just before that about reporting the crime I think Girish has bought a something quite important in the sense I agree that reporting after the crime occurs is quite a straightforward process and the police have taken into consideration what happens but however even in cassellius case if you see as soon as they got married as soon as cows alia left home came out and married there were about four to five attempts of registering a case and seeking protection which obviously didn't lead to anything fruitful what is your view on that I mean this is particularly where the police needs some sort of a cogent material to act upon if if cows Illya had presented evidenced saying that you know her parents had threatened her as she claims to be and then it is completely the fault of the police for not providing adequate protection and and in that sense more than anything else the police and the state of Tamil Nadu have failed in its duty to protect someone who is clearly vulnerable you actually you're raising something that has me thinking of something else you're raising an interesting point and it's about presenting evidence southern on what I found so interesting about your film is that you managed to talk to two sides in this story and that is the site of close sadly gap but you also managed to talk to her estranged family members some of which admit very freely on camera her brother being one of them that he'd like to kill her for her actions how did you get access to both sides of the family and why did they agree to speak to you I think Cynthia we approached cows early as soon as we saw the CCTV footage and when we explained about the process of filmmaking and what I was trying to do she was quite forthcoming because of two reasons one she at the point when I approached her was very actively creating awareness and when we spoke to schanke's family also we need to recognize that it's not just cows Allah or the contributors we see on camera there was plenty of family surrounding her from shankha side and they supported this as well I think one of the thought processes they had was following cows earlier with a camera crew would obviously provide her with some sort of a protection and also will help her create awareness about the issue however on the other side the sadly as parents they were quite skeptical about the film in the first place and then we tried explaining we wanted to give that platform that the local media hadn't given they haven't appeared on camera before they haven't been interviewed or their side of the story so when we said we will give them a fair platform irrespective of the views and what happens that is how they came about came on board and that's how we began filming I reported on this story for as I told you and I was able to speak to Shankar's family and I believe that there is a there is there are many things which are disturbing about about the way this has played out in the media as well as in the courts and the first thing is that when we want to understand honor killings it's not only about girls choosing to marry someone below their caste if it were not a Dalit the violence will not be so severe the reason is the Dalit community to which sir Shankar belong are traditionally Untouchables and it is this intersectionality of caste in this fact in this issue that really causes this very persistent resistance and a lot of communities support to the family who who ultimately were responsible for the killing and the attack see it is providential that a cow soleus survived the attack but she could have been killed as well and this all this would never have happened right so please just a moment and I also also need to say that when we talk when in this film as well I believe that shank da cow Celia has been you know focused upon quite rightly so I believe Shankar's family you know Shankar's mother passed away a long time ago and so the family has already lost a mother now the eldest son so it's it's a it's a tragedy of unspeakable proportions what does the father feel he was a daily wage worker who educated his children you know to a very high Neven what does he feel why is there a black noise of that so thank you for raising that Cynthia you know we actually got lots of comments online about that and money Roger I hear you and I want to get to you but first I want to bring in our community this is Paula V on Twitter who says to reiterate that caste is fundamental to understanding what constitutes honor in India no honour crime can be understood outside of a discussion on Cass and Doug and dogyum II it is lower caste particularly the 'lets who are punished violently for this we also got a video comment from someone who says something very similar I'll toss it to you southerner have a listen to what one person had to say when it comes to the issue of honor killing and develop community one of the things that we grapple with is Dalit feminists is the decentering of the dullard experienced in this whole context of violence too often the Dalits victim of the partnership their stories are not told their families grief is not held and their families fight for justice in the context of caste apartheid is never mentioned so one of the things that we try to do is to apply an intersectional frame and talk about honor killings not just in the context of gender but most crucially in the context of caste because this spectrum of violence would not occur without the impunity and the lack of the implementation of the rule of law when it comes to Delic bodies and dull apply sadhana yeah I would like to add on that I I completely agree that the voices of schanke's family is something that's crucial we had very in in this particular film of course we had quite limited access also we need to be very aware that their family for example schanke's father and Shankar's brother studying both their brothers are studying and the father is working there were quite reluctant to go on camera if you see we had a lot more luck getting the defendants on camera then getting schanke's family on camera they're very reluctant because they have to face the society every day they have to go out and work so there was a huge security concern on that that is unfortunately the graph reality of how it is there no but when I was reporting on it it was they were very accessible I was able to talk to Kausalya herself the brother spoke to me and that was in just in the wake of the incident that happened like you know two years ago so perhaps they went through a journey during that period and see that what she watched Southern I was saying also points to another thing the very vulnerability they have it's okay for these people to come on camera and talk clearly of threats killing their own daughters he the brother even talks about killing the grandmother because she's saying if the girl comes back I look after her but imagine these people have been victimized but they're they they don't have the social support they need to come on camera and see what they have to say they are the ones were to survive the serious survivors or such a horrendous crime which is why we have tweets like Sudan there I want to bring the Sweden she says I think the question must be why are dotted men in the case of caste-based honor killings being criminalized why are dotted families seen as threats to caste purity but that of course is something that Co Silvia is campaigning against here she is she's become an activist she's driven by what she says is this desire to make sure there are no more stories like that of her and Schanker she's sharing her experience with groups of people all around India have a look at what that campaigning looks like could either cut recording I cut took only a Samana Rashi says the real justice is the fight against the caste system how effective you think that message is going to be well it needs to be it needs to be effective as effective as it could be and just going back to an earlier point that you addressed about how much with impunity the brother of cows and I had spoken on camera about killing her and and I think Cynthia spoke about the brother also saying in a very casual manner that he would kill the grandmother if she were to take back cows Elia I think it shows it explains how ingrained the caste structure is in deeply in society that it it is now normalized it within within society to to to sort of stand by the side of caste even if it meant you know killing someone close to you killing someone who's married a person that that that was part of your family you know cows aliased I fight is in my opinion you know must be seen against a larger arc of sort of what social justice that will be in fighting for and and this and and in India especially in the south there's been a larger sort of a movement to grid the Society of of caste of course it hasn't been very successful and and of course today we honor killings is probably the worst form of caste based violence and discrimination that society has witnessed and and it makes that it makes Ksenia struggle all the more inspiring it makes her strength and fortitude all the more you know a courageous and relevant in the larger context because you know we live in a fast lee urbanizing space in chennai but you know there's close to about seven million people who are living here and whereas whereas still marrying across cos is seen as something so difficult and in the most recent research survey that we had done that the government had done only less than 10% of Indians had married across Cass growing and I think that's important to understand why it is still such a huge social taboo because there is no crime to marry against caste but yet the society the reason for that we're getting different answers and and some people say we need to do away with the caste system other people are saying this is deeper than any of that and this is about being in a patriarchal society which of course so many of us live in this is a video comment we got from some Sanju kita and basu and this is what she thought about it honor giving is not really about religion of course it is about patriarchy it is about controlling women's bodies and sexuality and controlling her reproductive potential because the idea that family honour or communities honor is rested upon the woman's bodies come from the fact that in her body the caste identities are produced and reproduced so to maintain the so-called purity of the caste it is important to control whom she's actually engages with because if women had freedom to choose what happens to her body or the freedom to choose her make her sexual choices the entire patriarchal and petrie local Apache lineal family system will crumble Cinthia see when I totally agree with what Sangeeta just said I just like to add that there is another layer of understanding in this and that is that it's not just patriarchy patriarchy is worldwide we see that the brand of patriarchy we see in India is particularly lethal to women and to Dalits because it is based on a religious ideology and so this is the the idea of caste superiority and inferiority which which basically is based on the Brahminical ideology is the cause for this and we really need to and and this factor very seriously and this is the reason why it's such a fraud issue and the GAO the Constitution has plenty of safeguards but the system needs to gear up to defend those Constitution and guarantees that people have of choice so not enough is being actually implemented southern I I can see you nodding there I just wanted to add what Cynthia said is an important point yes we are India is a very traditional patriarchal society but that I don't feel alone is the reason for these crimes if it were it's almost coming to an acceptance if let's say among the groups of cars that that are divided in the in Hinduism if they marry a cross to a similar level there is no such problem so inter caste marriages are happening but when it happens with the lower caste or Dalits are the most interested I mean that point yes exactly I completely agree that is the problem yes so it's it's it's really the untouchables who are the offending parties so if they're if they're if inter caste marriages happen with among other non Dalit caste as I said in the beginning the reaction is much less and the system also accommodates inter caste marriages among non you know between nonde let's but when there is a Dalit the system more or less conspires to see that complaints don't get filed prosecution you know investigations are weak and often you know the judge judgments also this is the very first time that you know we've got such a powerful judgment there's one more aspect to this judgement and that is that I think this is only the second time six people have been convicted in such a crime the only other one where six people were convicted was in the in the case of the assassination of rajiv gandhi so it's a lot here and yes because you brought up convictions i want to get the latest and where we are with the story just so our audience is up to date we got this tweet from Mooga who says i want to know if co sylia's father's appeal has been her if so what is the verdict where are we with Appeals right now sadhana so the prosecution on behalf of cassoulet obviously has appealed against the acquittals that whittle the release of the three defendants and also on the other hand the defendants who have been handed the sentence have appealed against their convictions both have been accepted in the High Court I think both the sides have informed me that they're waiting for a date for that to go through and be heard so we're waiting on dates for that to be heard at the High Court of Chennai and are you following along with the families as they await this verdict I it's on my understanding that cosa Lea is is almost in hiding because she fears for her life yeah she she is under police protection so we are very much in touch with her and also with the other side with the defendants as well you know there's something I think that we might we should look at here which is the legal process as well obviously in kau Celia's case she was able to provide very good evidence you know being the the best eyewitness and the survivor however in most of these other cases it's really difficult to find these witnesses which will lead to a fair and good prosecution and ultimately a conviction so I think what perhaps is less understood and I think the biggest legal challenge and political challenge is to come up with with the kind of law which will shift the burden on the family right there and I take your point that's all the time we have for now so thank you for making that point as a closing thought of our show Manu Raj Todd they're not in Cynthia thank you so much for being here of course you can watch the full documentary India's forbidden love and honor killing on trial on aljazeera.com and we'll see you online at hashtag h a stream
