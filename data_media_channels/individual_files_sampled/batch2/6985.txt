Gabriel Sherman with a really interesting story in Vanity Fair about how there's panic events around White House they're worried about the impeachment they think it's now legitimate possibility they're considering throwing even Jared Kushner under the bus and so at the end of the article though they explain why uranium one is in the news now I talked about this days ago I think before almost anyone else did and I and I honestly took me a little while to figure it out so now uranium one the selling of our uranium interest to Russian companies I think was a real issue six to seven years ago I think that it was a legitimate issue during the campaign and I covered it recently and I'm but I said but why is it coming up now it doesn't make any sense if Hillary Clinton was president maybe we could be continuing to talk about that did anything go wrong there right but Hillary Clinton isn't president so that uranium one deal even if it were a real story is now pretty much totally irrelevant and then I figured it out I'm like oh they're gonna say that Robert Muller was the head of the FBI at the time and hence he should go now we have confirmation that that is exactly what they're planning so Sherman explains Roger stone of course when the top advisors of the President believes defunding Muller isn't enough instead stone wants Trump to call for a special prosecutor to invest investigate Hillary Clinton's role and improving the approving the controversial uranium one deal why why uranium one well exactly for what I explained to you days ago it's a bit of a bank shot but as stone described it a special prosecutor looking into uranium one would also have to investigate the FBI's role and approving to deal thereby making Muller who was in charge of the Bureau at the time at target they go on explains those choice for a special prosecutor Rudy Giuliani's law colleague marked Lucchesi hilarious or Fox News pundit Andrew Napolitano hilarious and here's the quote from stone you would immediately have to reform Muller Comey and Deputy Attorney General rod Rosenstein that they are under federal investigation Trump can't afford to fire Muller politically but this pushes him aside well thank you very much for letting us know what your plot is out in the open so now if you hear about uranium 1 on fox news or from Republican congressman you know for a fact that it is a Roger stone plot when I just owned as the hatchet man for a lot of Republicans primarily now of course Donald Trump and so he hatched this plot that has nothing to do with the reality of who's in power today or what would be a relevant investigation it's specific purpose is to try to get rid of the special prosecutor because of what he might find out about Donald Trump and his connections to Russia so anyone talking about uranium one going forward is you have to understand that issue is completely illegitimate it is a political trick so I'm just amazed that they telling people so thank you for being stupid enough to confirm what we had suspected so totally illegitimate issue made up as a political trick end of question period anyone talking about uranium one is part of a literally a Republican plot to try to protect the president from a legitimate investigation of his connections to Russia if you like this video you love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
