so you thought child-killer Terry Lynn McClintock being transferred to a native healing lodge was egregious and you thought serial killer Elizabeth whet Laufer being transferred to a psychiatric hospital was outrageous he'll just will you hear about a child killer in the UK who's now suing the state because he thinks being incarcerated is unfair in Britain child killer Carl Doyle is suing the Ministry of Justice for 1 million pounds claiming it's unfair that he must language in prison for so long here's the back story folks in 1981 Doyle was 12 years old when he battered and strangled John Martyn McLean who was only 8 Doyle was convicted of murder but was released in 1990 just nine years after this heinous act alas not only is Doyle a monster he's also a moron he was obviously too stupid to realize that he won the lottery by getting out of prison so early for such a terrible crime that's because Doyle found himself back behind bars in 2005 when he was convicted of carrying out a petrol bomb attack this time he received a prison sentence of three years and four months yet here we are in 2018 and guess what folks Doyle is thankfully still behind bars that's because his sentencing judge said it would ultimately be the parole board that would decide when Doyle could be released and that's the rub for whatever reason Doyle hasn't convinced the parole board he's worthy of freedom Doyle is shocked he hasn't seen the light of day yet I mean surely in his estimation if he only did nine years in the slammer for murdering a child a petrol bomb attack is worth what may be three weeks tops so he's now moving ahead with plan B he's suing the Ministry of Justice for 1 million pounds his statement of claim notes that his sentences quote manifestly excessive and unjust end quote Wow such entitlement you know it brings to mind the prison riot scene from Naked Gun three real slap has got chunks of things in it this shuttle a blank 68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled they say room temperature what do you think we are animals as well Doyle claims he's the victim of discrimination and has been attacked by Muslim extremists so he's also claiming damages for injuries and suffering oh oh oh boy bad bad move here mr. Doyle playing the Muslim extremists card will do you no favors in the UK today that kind of runs contrary to that whole official multicultural mosaic narrative in fact you better watch your mouth just invoking the M word in a critical fashion could result in an additional prison sentence in any event I think it all boils down to this Doyle might have a point that given the severity of his second crime 13 years and Counting is maybe a tad harsh but maybe just maybe that for a change this is all about the justice system course correcting itself for a very very bad decision it made back in 1990 when this thug was first released after all a mere eight-year sentence for killing a child is grotesque and by committing another crime as a free man it's obvious Doyle learned nothing while behind bars so in other words keeping this reprobate indefinitely locked up is perhaps a measure of revenge or karma and while the prison system is supposed to be all about rehabilitation these days you want to know something folks whenever I look at that photograph of John Martin McLean the little boy who'd also viciously murdered some 37 years ago I gotta admit revenge works for me for the rebel dawn media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the Breville has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
