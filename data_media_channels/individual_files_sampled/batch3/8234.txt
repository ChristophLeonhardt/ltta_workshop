♪ ♪ Sean: IT APPEARS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO TAKE A BRIEF HIATUS IN HIS CRITICISM OF ROBERT MUELLER'S WITCH HUNT. THE PRESIDENT TWEETED I'M HEADING TO CANADA FOR G7 FOR TALKS THAT WILL MOSTLY CENTER ON THE LONG-TIME UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. FROM THERE I GO TO SINGAPORE AND TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA. ON THE DENUCLEARIZATION. OF COURSE, OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. WON'T BE TALKING ABOUT THE RUSSIA WITCH HUNT HOAX FOR A WHILE. HERE WITH REACTION TO THE UPCOMING I.G. REPORT. AND MUELLER'S ONGOING WITCH HUNT, MARK PENN. ATTORNEY VICTORIA TUENSING. DAVID LIMBAUGH. ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT DAVID, VICTORIA AND EVERYBODY, I HAVE THE BEST LAWYERS IN THE WORLD. THEY HAVE DONE LEGAL WORK FOR ME. BUT IF I DON'T SAY IT EVERY TIME THE LEFT WING MEDIA HAS WHAT HEART ATTACK OVER NOTHING. GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL. DAVID, I'LL START WITH YOU. WE KNOW CRIMES ARE COMMITTED HERE. NOW THE PRESIDENT IS MOVING IN TO REAL OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT WILL IMPACT THE ENTIRE WORLD. OUR KIDS AND GRAND KIDS. BUT THE WITCH HUNT CONTINUES. SMART OF HIM TO LET IT GO FOR A WHILE? YEAH, I THINK THAT THE MEDIA WILL NEVER LET IT GO. TRUMP CAN RE-ENTER THE FRAY ANY TIME HE WANTS TO. I THINK PEOPLE HAVE UNDER ESTIMATED TRUMP ON FOREIGN POLICY AND TREAT HIM AS A COMIC BOOK PLAYER. I ADMIT I'M SURPRISED THAT HE IS AS GOOD AS HE IS. ON FOREIGN POLICY, I MEAN. WHEN HE MADE HIS COMMENT ABOUT NOT PREPARING WHAT HE MEANT IS HE HAS NEGOTIATED ALL HIS LIFE. HE DIDN'T PINE HE DIDN'T MEAN HE WOULDN'T BONE UP ON SOUTH KOREA, NORTH KOREA AND U.S. HISTORY. Sean: HE SAID HE HAS BEEN PREPARING HIS WHOLE LIFE. LOOK AT THE WAY HE IS A REALIST. HE IS WILLING TO WALK AWAY. LOOK HOW CALM HE IS. HE BELITTLES ROCKET MAN WHEN HE KNOWS TO BUT OTHERWISE HE IS SERIOUS AND HE ENTICED HIM. I THINK TRUMP IS SEEN AS A CAPITALIST. KIM JONG UN IS IN WORST SHAPE THAN HE HAS EVER BEEN IN. OF CHINA AND UNITED STATES HELP HIM REBUILD HIS DARK COUNTRY. Sean: HAS HE STARTED TO PURGE SOME OF THE OLD HOLDOVERS THAT, YOU KNOW, WOULD BE SO RIGID AGAINST CHANGE? LET ME GO TO THE I.G. REPORT. ANOTHER BIG STORY. YOU ARE A LONG-TIME CLINTON POLLSTER, MARK. YOU HAVE BEEN THERE. YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICAL. DAVID AND VICTORIA WILL TELL YOU THAT HILLARY VIOLATED MULTIPLE LAWS. SERVER, LITERALLY HAVING TOP SECRET CLASSIFIED SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAM INFORMATION ON AN MISHANDLED IT, DESTROYED IT, COVERED IT UP, OBSTRUCTED AFTER SUBPOENA DELETIONS AND ALL OF THAT. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? WE KNOW THE TRUTH THAT IS WHAT THE I.G. SHOULD SAY. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT HAVING WORKED FOR THEM SO LONG? YOU KNOW, FIRST, LET ME SAY ON THE EVE OF THE SUMMITS. I HOPE THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE DISCIPLINE WITH THE TWITTER ACCOUNT AND I HOPE GIULIANI HAS DISCIPLINE AND SCHUMER AND PELOSI HAS DISCIPLINE SO WE AS A COUNTRY SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE AGAINST A DICTATOR FOR SOMETHING THAT CAN AFFECT ALL OF OUR CHILDREN FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. I THINK IT WILL REQUIRE THAT KIND OF DISCIPLINE. NOW WHEN THIS REPORT COMES OUT A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER, THIS REPORT IS ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO BE ABOUT THE CLINTONS. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHETHER THE CLINTON Sean: PARTLY IT IS. HOW WAS IT HANDLED OR MISHANDLED? YES BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT WHETHER THE F.B.I. DID ITS JOB PROPERLY OR IMPROPERLY? THAT IS WHAT THE REPORT IS ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS BECAUSE THAT CARRY OUT THAT INVESTIGATION FAIRLY, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT THEY CARRIED OUT THE TRUMP RUSSIA INVESTIGATION FAIRLY? Sean: YOU HAVE BEEN OUTSPOKEN AND CRITICAL AS A DEMOCRAT. I HAVE TO GIVE YOU CREDIT. THIS IS BAD FOR THE COUNTRY. IT CAN'T STAND. I THINK OUR CONSTITUTION IS BEING STEPPED ON, SEAN. AND WE REALLY HAVE TO BE ON GUARD HERE THAT PRESIDENTS CAN DO THEIR JOB WITHOUT THE CONSTANT THREAT OF AN INVESTIGATIONS FOR EVERYBODY IN THEIR ADMINISTRATION, FOR EVERYBODY IN A CAMPAIGN THAT GO ON WITHOUT END. I CAN TELL YOU I'VE BEEN THERE. I WAS WITH THE PRESIDENT IN 1998. IT DID NOT HELP THE COUNTRY WE WASTED A YEAR ON THAT. IT DID NOT HELP THE COUNTRY WE WASTED A YEAR ON THIS. WE SHOULDN'T BE WASTING ANOTHER YEAR IN THE ABSENCE OF REALLY COMPELLING EVIDENCE WHICH WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN ANY RESPECT SEEN. Sean: LET ME GO TO YOU, VICTORIA. I THINK THE EVIDENCE IS INCONTROVERTIBLE. BUT MARK IS RIGHT, IT WILL DEAL MOSTLY WITH THE INVESTIGATION. BUT THERE ARE UNDERLYING CRIMES. THE FACTS ARE NOT IN DISPUTE. JAMES COMEY LAID THEM OUT TWO DAYS AFTER THEY EXONERATED HILLARY. HOW SHOULD THIS BE HANDLED IF THE CRIMES WERE COMMITTED AN THE INVESTIGATION WAS RIGGED? I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT. THIS TRUMP COLLUSION INVESTIGATION. THAT IS JUST A MOCKERY. HOW THE REPUBLICANS ARE FAILING US. THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB. I HAVE SOME VERY GOOD SOURCES. LET ME TELL YOU THAT SPEAKER RYAN AND TREY GOWDY DECIDED IT WAS NOT IN THE MODERATE, THE REPUBLICAN MODERATES' INTEREST FOR THE FALL ELECTION, IT WAS BAD POLITICS TO BE AT ODDS WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. AND THE DEMOCRATS ON THE 2016 ELECTION. SO THEY DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO TAMP IT DOWN. WHEN TREY GOWDY CAME ON FOX AND SAID WELL, WHEN THE F.B.I. HEARD WHAT THEY HEARD, THEY DID EXACTLY WHAT WE ALL HOPED THEY WOULD DO. NO, HE WAS TAMPING IT DOWN. AND THEY WERE NOT DOING WHAT WE HOPE THEY WOULD DO, BECAUSE THEY DID NOT FOLLOW PROTOCOL. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE AMERICAN AND SAY DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE BEING TARGETED BY THE RUSSIANS? NOT ONLY THAT. TREY GOWDY SAID THAT WITH ANY OTHER KNOWLEDGE WHATSOEVER. DO YOU KNOW WHY, SEAN? BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE DOCUMENTS. Sean: YEAH. AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED? YESTERDAY, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DELIVERED, THE DOCUMENTS BY D.O.J. THEY GOT SNOOKERED BECAUSE THE D.O.J. BACKED OFF. THEY BACKED OFF. WHY DID THEY DO IT? BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PUT THEM OUT NEXT WEEK WHEN WE HAVE THE NOKO Sean: PUT IT ON TUESDAY. THEY WANT IT BURIED WITH THE I.G. REPORT. THE REPUBLICANS GOT SNOOKERED BEING NICE. JUST LIKE YOU SAID. YOU CAN'T SUCK UP TO YOUR
