we want you to listen to what the president said again listen and remember he was asked simple questions if he believes US intelligence assessments and let me just say one more thing before I get to it US intelligence well the president of the United States has appointed the current heads of our US intelligence agencies please watch my people came to me dan coates came to me and some others they said they think it's Russia I have President Putin he just said it's not Russia I will say this I don't see any reason why it would be I'll say I have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today streaming really loud so I just want to let you know my kids yell emphatically sometimes their eyes glaze over and they're straight up lying according to what the president said right there Vladimir Putin's word his word not evidence his word is more reliable than the combined efforts of the National Security Agency director of national intelligence central intelligence agency and Federal Bureau of Investigations collectively more than 110,000 patriotic Americans a tree otic led by four trump appointees let me say there were these people and I said to you yesterday the president likes use war patriot all the time the definition of the word patriot is one who vigorously defends the values of their country especially in the face of an adversary an enemy or a detractor that is what a patriot is what the president did yesterday was on patriot he didn't just choose those four by the way all of whom are Trump appointees he didn't just speak out against his department his Director of National Intelligence dan coates whom he picked but Putin's word is apparently more reliable than the Justice Department which is leveling indictments against Russians involved in election interference who's the head of the SS Department the Attorney General Jeff Sessions probably one of the most loyal Trump appointees Putin's word is more reliable to the hard-working staffers of the House and Senate intelligence committees Democrats and Republicans who are investigating Russian influence both committees currently chaired by Republicans according to the president these organizations and when you take them all together it's now staffed by nearly a quarter million Americans whose job it is to help keep America safe they are not collectively as trustworthy as this man there's any doubt on that point the president tweeted this morning while I had a great meeting with NATO I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin and here's what he told CBS News your DNI dan coats said that America's digital infrastructures at a critical point right now no similar to what it was like in some ways before 9/11 and that is were susceptible to a to a large-scale attack you agree with that well I don't know if I agree with that I have to look okay so he said he didn't believe there he didn't really agree with Dan coats his appointee this is crazy stuff Stephanie this is crazy stuff Vladimir Putin spoke loudly and forcefully or whatever he said and that is better than all of the assessments by the way according to the Washington Post the president got a hundred page briefing before he went into the meeting with Vladimir Putin didn't read most of it and in fact the direction of what those hundred-page said was to be very strong and forceful against Vladimir Putin clearly that is not what he did Dan coats his response after the president was supposed to like Dan thinks it's Russia I don't really think so dan coats then reissued his statement saying yes indeed it is Russia he released that statement his office said without clearing it by the White House hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest interviews and highlights you can get more MSNBC for free every day we our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
