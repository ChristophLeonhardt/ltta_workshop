1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,440
FREEDOM.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,007
I'M LELAND VITTERT.

3
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:07,241
NOW BACK TO THE "YOUR WORLD"

4
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,143
SPECIAL.

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,945
>> YOU'RE A VET, YOU WAIT AND

6
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,747
YOU WAIT A LONG TIME STILL.

7
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:15,049
IS THAT TRUE?

8
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:16,484
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

9
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,285
AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE HILL

10
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:20,254
DID A REPORT ON THIS JUST IN

11
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,890
MARTHA V.A. HAD BEEN CAUGHT

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,091
SENDING FALSE REPORTS ABOUT WAIT

13
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,193
TIMES.

14
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:28,563
WE KNOW THAT VETERANS ARE STILL

15
00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:30,364
WAITING ON AVERAGE LONGER FOR

16
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,566
CARE, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE

17
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:32,366
PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT FIXING

18
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,968
WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE.

19
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:36,504
>> Trish: V.A. WHISTLE-BLOWER

20
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:38,072
SCOTT DAVIS SPOKE TO NEIL AND

21
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:39,974
CONGRESS ABOUTED.

22
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:41,809
PASSING BILL TO GIVE OUR

23
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:42,944
VETERANS MORE ACCESS TO

24
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:45,746
HEALTHCARE OUTSIDE THE V.A.

25
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,282
LET'S GO TO VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN

26
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,383
CONGRESSMAN, SCOTT TAYLOR.

27
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,284
GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.

28
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,719
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

29
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,754
>> Trish: SO ARE YOU HAPPY?

30
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,990
>> HAPPY ABOUT WHAT?

31
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,991
ABOUT THE BILL THAT WE PASSED?

32
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:58,926
>> Trish: YEAH, YEAH.

33
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,962
IS THIS GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER

34
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:02,697
FOR VETERANS TO GET A DIFFERENT

35
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:04,298
KIND OF CARE, BETTER CARE.

36
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,700
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S

37
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,435
IMPORTANT TO SAY, YEAH, I'M

38
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:08,402
OPTIMISTIC THAT IT WILL.

39
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,437
IT'S A GOOD BILL.

40
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:12,573
IT WILL TAKE QUITE FRANKLY A LOT

41
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:18,246
OF FOCUS FROM THE INCUMBENT

42
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:19,313
SECRETARY AND FOLKS LIKE MYSELF

43
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,049
TO MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS.

44
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:22,583
ABSOLUTELY.

45
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,820
IN MY OWN V.A., MY BIG HOSPITAL

46
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,722
THERE HAS -- IS A ONE STAR OUT

47
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:29,357
OF FIVE STAR IN TERMS OF WAIT

48
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:30,591
BACKS AND CALL BACKS.

49
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,360
THAT'S WHAT A VETERAN SEES.

50
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,762
WE HAVE TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT.

51
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,564
THIS BILL WILL DEAL WITH THAT WE

52
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:41,135
HAVE TO EXPEDITE HIRING.

53
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,371
WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT

54
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:43,771
BUREAUCRACY.

55
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,439
IT WILL HAVE TO HAVE RIGOROUS

56
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,474
OVERSIGHT AND DETERMINED FOCUS

57
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:47,975
TO GET IT IMPLEMENTED.

58
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,210
>> REPRESENTATIVE, WHAT DO YOU

59
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,046
SAY TO THOSE THAT ARE "YOUR

60
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:56,918
WORLD" -- WORRIED THIS WILL TAKE

61
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:58,819
AWAY FROM THE HOSPITALS

62
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:59,220
THEMSELVES?

63
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,655
THE V.A. COULD BE MORE

64
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:02,890
COMPETITIVE, OFFER BETTER CARE,

65
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,457
MAYBE NOT.

66
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,094
>> LET ME SAY WE NEED A WHOLE

67
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,162
CULTURE CHANGE IN CUSTOMER

68
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:08,496
SERVICE.

69
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,330
WE NEED TO BE CUSTOMER SERVICE

70
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,999
ORIENTED FOR VETERANS IN THE

71
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:12,400
V.A.

72
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,935
THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICS GOING

73
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:15,036
ON ON THE LEFT.

74
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:18,673
LIKE OKAY, YOU'RE PRIVATIZING

75
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:19,307
THE V.A.

76
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:21,509
IT'S THE DUTY AND THE

77
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,276
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT

78
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:24,145
TO CARE FOR OUR VETERANS WHEN

79
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:24,845
THEY COME BACK.

80
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,480
THERE SHOULD BE MORE PRIVATE

81
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,248
OPTIONS OUT THERE.

82
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:28,583
THERE'S PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

83
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,718
THAT NEED THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO

84
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,486
SUPPLEMENT THE V.A. AND/OR

85
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,821
COMPETE IN SOME AREAS.

86
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,122
THERE'S SOME AREAS THAT QUITE

87
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,425
FRANKLY NEED THE V.A. TO HELP

88
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:39,293
THEM IN THEIR PRIVATE CARE.

89
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,495
MORE OPTIONS, PRIVATE

90
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,497
PARTNERSHIPS IS A GOOD THING

91
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,766
RATHER THAN A BAD THING.

92
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:46,567
>> Trish: SO HOW LONG WILL IT

93
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,202
TAKE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE IN YOUR

94
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:48,502
VIEW?

95
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,571
>> THE CONGRESS HAS HAD A YEAR

96
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,740
TO GET THIS THING IMPLEMENTED.

97
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,477
AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE, THE V.A.

98
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,412
IS A VERY BIG BUREAUCRACY.

99
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:01,349
YOU CAN SPEND A CAREER TRYING TO

100
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:01,949
FIX IT.

101
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,651
I'M NOT UNDER ANY ILLUSIONS THAT

102
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,152
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE DIFFICULT

103
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,887
BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT AND FIGHT

104
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,222
TO GET IT DONE.

105
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,724
HOPEFULLY WITHIN A YEAR.

106
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:12,526
BUT THAT WILL TAKE FOCUS AND A

107
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,394
LOT OF OVERSIGHT.

108
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:16,030
>> Trish: WHAT HAPPENS IF NOT AS

109
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,431
MANY REPUBLICANS ARE IN THE

110
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,133
SEATS COME 2018 AND YOU'RE STILL

111
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,735
WORKING TO GET THIS IMPLEMENTED

112
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,471
AND UP TO SPEED?

113
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:24,839
ARE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL THAT

114
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,274
YOUR PROCESS WILL BE DERAILED?

115
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,876
>> I WOULD HOPE NOT.

116
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,112
I THINK THAT AGAIN, MORE OPTIONS

117
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:32,680
IN GETTING THESE WAIT TIMES

118
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:32,980
DOWN.

119
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,715
THERE SHOULD BE A DESIRE BY BOTH

120
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,517
SIDES OF THE AISLE TO GET THIS

121
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:36,817
DONE.

122
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,487
I DON'T THINK WE'RE MOVING --

123
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:43,691
WE'RE PRIVATIZING THE V.A. AS A

124
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,225
POLITICAL THING.

125
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,993
I HOPE TO WIN MAJORITY.

126
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,729
IF WE DON'T, I THINK THAT THEIR

127
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,331
RHETORIC OF PRIVATIZING THE V.A.

128
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,366
WILL BE DOWN PLAYED, NOT SAYING

129
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,134
IT ANYMORE.

130
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:54,135
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT VETERAN

131
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:55,836
SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS, VETERANS

132
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,405
ARE PRESSURING TO MAKE SURE THIS

133
00:03:57,405 --> 00:04:00,141
IS IMPLEMENTED TO MAKE SURE

134
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:02,410
THERE'S PROPER OVERSIGHT TO GET

135
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,044
IT DONE.

136
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:05,579
THERE'S A DESIRE TO REDUCE THE

137
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,848
WAIT TIMES AND TAKE CARE OF OUR

138
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:08,215
VETERANS.

139
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,984
>> Trish: CONGRESSMAN, YOU'RE A

140
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:10,918
FORMER NAVY SEAL.

141
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,054
I'M SURE YOU HAVE A LOT OF

142
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:16,057
FRIENDS THAT HAVE COME HOME AND

143
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:17,491
FOUND A CHALLENGING SITUATION.

144
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,959
NOT JUST IN TERMS OF FINDING A

145
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,161
JOB AND FIT BACK INTO SOCIETY IN

146
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,963
TERMS OF THE HORRORS THEY HAVE

147
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,466
SEEN BUT TO ALSO GET THE PROPER

148
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,033
MEDICAL CARE.

149
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,302
HOW MUCH OF YOUR PERSONAL

150
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,203
EXPERIENCE AND YOUR FRIENDS

151
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,871
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HAS

152
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,306
INFLUENCED YOUR WILLINGNESS TO

153
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,941
SEE THIS CHANGE AND DESIRE TO

154
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,875
PUSH IT THROUGH?

155
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,711
>> IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE

156
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,045
TAKING CARE OF THAT UNBROKEN

157
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,313
LINE OF PATRIOTS THAT HAVE

158
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,950
STEPPED FORWARD ON BEHALF OF

159
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,918
THIS NATION.

160
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,121
I HAVE THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING

161
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,689
SOME OF THE MOST ACTIVE VETS IN

162
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,256
THE NATION.

163
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,858
I HAVE TONS OF FRIENDS THAT ARE

164
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:51,759
IN THE V.A.

165
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,527
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE DEAL WITH

166
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:54,929
EVERY DAY IN MY DISTRICT.

167
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,497
IT'S A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY.BUT

168
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,199
IT'S AN HONOR OR THE ME TO DO

169
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,466
SO.

170
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,300
ON THIS MEMORIAL DAY AND

171
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,901
MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND, WE WISH

172
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,838
NOTHING BUT THE BEST OF THE OUR

173
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:05,740
VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

174
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,774
>> Trish: REPRESENTATIVE TAYLOR,

175
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,776
MY DAD IS A VETERAN AND HE

176
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,911
RELIES ON THE V.A. CARE.

177
00:05:10,911 --> 00:00:00,000
I HOPE YOU DO ALL YOU CAN FOR
