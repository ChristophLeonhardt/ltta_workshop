00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
okay I'm sorry you didn't understand but

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,110
if you don't know what I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,730
then just<font color="#E5E5E5"> click here magical I don't</font>

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,940
hate you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do care about your opinions</font>

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,759
some of you did get the sarcasm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,830
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you did get the irony but many</font>

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you didn't and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like hundred</font>

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,140
subscribers a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,220
unsubscribed because he thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,160
being serious or being disrespectful Oh

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,630
miles I can't believe you could be so

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,849
insensitive I thought your channels all

13
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,800
about helping people if you want me to

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,690
be honest my channel is about inspiring

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,989
people and sometimes it's about rattling

16
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,000
people's perceptions I'm not denying

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,070
that what I made was provocative it was

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,809
my intention it was meant to push a few

19
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,520
buttons but it was meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make you</font>

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what was actually being said</font>

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,420
did you see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video was a video</font>

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,090
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> to did you notice what category</font>

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,190
it was in and perhaps the reason I was

24
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">swearing at whoever was watching the</font>

25
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,480
video and criticizing heavily<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,980
right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an opinion was to</font>

27
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,930
demonstrate an exaggerated version of

28
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,059
censorship the reason I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in your</font>

29
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,360
face was so that you felt violated and

30
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,340
it made you feel emotion it made you

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,400
feel involved and with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it meant</font>

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you felt the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to respond but</font>

33
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can and why was that because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">were censored and you were therefore</font>

35
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,880
unable to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> your opinion and as for</font>

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,150
the HMS sensor that was the big clue in

37
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,310
the video it doesn't exist it's not real

38
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,229
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you believe that was</font>

39
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,479
real because some people did so on

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,670
message me telling me they had media

41
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,650
coursework and they had to write about

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,390
censorship and they said they couldn't

43
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">find where censorship came from so they</font>

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,579
wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the HMS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sensor so yeah that</font>

45
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,439
story about the ship was a lie but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

46
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell you the real story back in history</font>

47
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,149
there was something called the HMS iron

48
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,649
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason it was called that was</font>

49
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,890
because the ship's shape was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that of an</font>

50
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">iron but it was no ordinary ship it was</font>

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,719
built to provide transport for people

52
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,610
who were afraid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> flying but</font>

53
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,290
unfortunately during his voyage it's

54
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,829
sunk and everyone died but the last

55
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,170
sounds ever reported by boats that were

56
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">near buying can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get there in time was</font>

57
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,130
the sounds of e

58
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,870
he probably said with a bit more

59
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">emphasis because they were drowning and</font>

60
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,000
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HMS iron put together with E and</font>

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,310
it created irony and that's where irony

62
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,130
came from look I'm genuinely sorry if I

63
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,080
caused<font color="#E5E5E5"> offence to anyone but all I ask</font>

64
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,850
is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know anyone who may have left</font>

65
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,190
my channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of that video just</font>

66
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them to come back tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him to check</font>

67
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,940
this and tell them it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sometimes</font>

68
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">in life we need to be challenged from</font>

69
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,500
doing the video I have learnt a lot her

70
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,140
and I guess I hope you've learned a lot

71
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,020
to You so it's censorship good or is it

72
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,500
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sarcasm good or is it bad is</font>

73
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,080
sat I good or is it bad and irony well I

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,400
guess it depends if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that boat</font>

75
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,160
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that case I guess you</font>

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">could say irony is bad</font>
