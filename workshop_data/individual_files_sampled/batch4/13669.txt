all right everybody thanks for watching or listening if you're listening to the podcast on The Daily wire what I let me just say up front parental warning advisory hear that IIIi know some people have told me they're like watching my videos are listening to the podcast with their kids and with their family which is great because I try to be family friendly as much as possible but this conversation will by necessity I'm going to have to use some words and phrases and talk about some things that aren't appropriate or suitable for younger kids so I wif you got kids around maybe just watch something else and then come back to this later but do come back to it please because I think it's an important conversation all right so for all the adults senator Cory Booker last week provided us with I think a very helpful but also disturbing illustration of something he was at Mike Pompeo s confirmation hearing Mike Pompeo is president Trump's nominee for Secretary of State and Cory Booker when it was his turn to ask questions he decided to ask Pompeyo about his views on sodomy so not just gay marriage okay and that would also be irrelevant to the job but no this wasn't a discussion of well what are you what's your opinion on laws pertaining to gay marriage or do you think the state should recognize gay marriages do you think the state should be involved in marriage at all all of that stuff would also be irrelevant but you know that the left Democrats are gonna bring that up Booker took it a step further and he put gay marriage aside he said he wanted to know this was his phrase what's your opinion on gay sex he asked him in your opinion is gay sex a perversion and Pompeyo wasn't quick enough in responding I guess so Booker asked him two more times in total three times he brought up gay sex to Mike Pompeo at a confirmation hearing for Secretary of State three times he shouted at him gay sex now first of all this is obviously just a very thinly veiled very very thinly veiled attack on Christianity because everyone knows that any serious Christian any devout Christian who's familiar with his faith and has read the Bible is obviously going to believe that sodomy is perversion because it says it right there in the Bible multiple times Old Testament and New Testament there's no way around it this is it's just it's right there there is no other acceptable answer if you if you are familiar at all about what your faith teaches sodomy is definitely listed as not just a sin by the way but sodomy is in the Bible multiple times across the old and new testaments it is singled out as a particularly dire and grave sin in fact there are only four sins in Scripture that are listed as sins that cry out to heaven for vengeance only four times does that phrase appear of a sin crying out to God for divine retribution and sodomy is one of those sins okay so that's how serious God takes it and it that phrase appears in Genesis which means that this is not just a belief held by Christianity but in fact by all the Abrahamic religions Judaism Islam as well but does anyone seriously believe that Cory Booker or any other Democrat would berate a Muslim about this a Muslim is going to feel exactly the same way he may even feel it stronger yet that's not going to come up with a Muslim only with a Christian because this is anti-christian this is about keeping Christians out of public office that's pretty clear but anyone who watched the confirmation hearing you know they probably watched it and they were hoping to hear a discussion about subjects related to American diplomacy and national security cory booker just wanted to talk about sex position positions and for that reason even aside from the anti-christian angle for that reason this whole scene was a perfect also bizarre and gross illustration of what the modern democrat party and modern liberalism has become and i say that because the left in america is obsessed with sex and obsessed with getting everyone's approval of their sexual exploits it it always comes back to sex for them have you noticed that everything comes back to sex it always ends up back there and not just with sex generally but with i need you to approve of these specific things i do in the bedroom not just tolerate a proof celebrate affirm everything goes back to that it's all about sex everything's about sex and this is where godless pagan ideologies always leave pagan societies are are debauched societies for a reason you think about the ancient pagan civilizations where you go to the pagan temple and there would be orgies and prostitution where sex is treated heads as this kind of sacred right and sex is also a sacred right to the modern peg in the modern idol worshipper the modern self worshipper the modern leftist and it's a sacred right because sex is to them the ultimate pleasure seeking act is the ultimate it is the ultimate act of finding pleasure you know not just in life but but using another in this again this is for this is from the godless secular perspective with sex you are using another person and kind of dominating them and using them for your own pleasure you have turned a whole other human being into a tool for your pleasure and so that's why it is the it's the ultimate because pleasure is the ultimate now to the christian sex is also sacred but for a different reason because it bonds together husband and wife and because it opens up the potential for the creation of human life sex is something that can create another human being and for that reason it is so important there's this dumb stereotype that Christians are afraid of sex couldn't be further from the truth Christianity has this deep respect for sex and it wants it but to protect it what if you go to an art museum and you see a great piece of art what why why is there security around it why would you put armed guards and security offense you know why would you put that around a piece of art is because you're afraid of the art you're afraid the arts gonna come to life and attack people no it's because the art is a beautiful thing and you respect it that's why you protect it why does sup why would someone go into face art why would they go spray you know graffiti all over the Mona Lisa why would they do it it's because they is because they really appreciate art and they think art is so fun no it's because they don't respect it they have no respect for it they don't see its inherent beauty and its inherent value and worth so they deface it and they defile it and they make it something cheap and worthless in Christianity that we in the church we talk about consummating a marriage and everyone knows consummating a marriage is what happens when the married couple goes back to their room after the wedding and they have sex that's consummating the marriage what does consummation mean consummation means completion it means bringing something to completion so that's really significant think about what that means we say that a marriage is consummated through sex in Christianity that it that means that the marital covenant itself is brought to completion when the husband and wife come together intimately when the husband and wife have sex that is the completion of the marital covenant that's what kind of that's sort of like the lock that seals it and now it is inseparable it's for life so that's how Christianity treats sex not at all something to be afraid of but something to something to respect and to and to reserve for this holy setting between husband and wife in the godless secular world sex is just pleasure they've emptied it of all meaning meaning they've defiled it they've sprayed graffiti on it they've de faced it they've taken all of value and worth out of it and so now sex they've just boiled it down to the one aspect just the physical sensation so sex is just pleasure and nothing else and and it's no other put so sex is like it's it's similar to playing a video game playing a sport watching TV is just a little bit more pleasurable than those things but it's no more significant than that and pleasure is the point of life sex is the best way to get pleasure therefore sex is the point of life and that's why they're obsessed with it but it's also why if we're gonna talk about who's afraid of sex it's not the Christians it's them they're afraid of what sex really is and that's why we talk about you know that's why they they are that's why we need to erect these barriers and everything else and you know physical actual physical barriers that are used in the sexual act it's because they're afraid of sex not the Christians and that why they demand that we affirm their sexual habits not tolerate but affirm and now they still say they want us to mind our own business and you know it's none of our business but this isn't what you do if you want someone to mind their own business if you don't want people talking about your sex life you don't bring it up at a confirmation hearing you don't march through the street announcing it to everybody that's not what you do when you want people to mind their own business and this is what you know what this is the thing maybe in life that frustrates me more than anything else is intellectual dishonesty intellectual dishonesty what is what makes most of our discussions in society completely fruitless and worthless and why they devolve into incoherence within seconds and they never amount to anything and no conclusions are ever drawn and no one ever comes to any kind of agreement or consensus at all on any argument the reason is because these are intellectually dishonest arguments and both people in the argument or at least one person in the argument usually on the left on the on the left side of the equation they're not being honest about what they actually believe and what their intentions actually are in the conversation so they'll say hey let's talk about my sex life and then you'll say I and I'd really rather not and they'll say this is what I do in my sex life do you approve no why are you talking about my sex life this is none of your business well which is it is it none of my business or do you want to talk about it it's got to be one of the other it's the same thing with and and if you don't want to talk about it's none of my business why are you marching through the street announcing I mean literally announcing it to the world marching through the street saying hey everybody look at me this is my sex life look why are you doing that a Gay Pride Parade what what why you have the right that there's no more fighting for your rights you have the right to do whatever you want America no one's stopping you okay you can do whatever you want why are you announcing it what's the point if it's none of my business what are you doing in the street waving a flag I'm paint you literally have a flag representing your sex life why it's the same thing with the feminists in their vagina hats wearing vagina costumes talking explicitly about their genitals and then they were coil in horror if anyone dares intrude in their private life I mean you've got a whoop you got women wearing vagina costumes holding signs saying stay out of my business I would love to stay out of your business but look at you look at you I can't even worse they demand that we subsidize their sex life by subsidizing their birth control so they say hey mind your business get out of my bedroom but before you leave put your put your wallet on the dresser there because I'm gonna need you to pay for this it doesn't work that way I'm sorry a couple general rules of society number one if you ask someone to pay for something they get to have an opinion about it number two even if you don't ask them to pay for it if you bring up okay if you openly share details about your personal life with me I get to have an opinion and express it and you don't get to act like you're victimized because you brought it up it's the court of public opinion in many ways operates like a court of law okay think of it like that at least as far as this goes imagine that a guy's on trial for arson okay and in his past he's been convicted of burglary well the defense team will go to the judge and they'll say that's his private life that's his personal life that's his personal history it's not relevant to the arson two different things this shouldn't come up in the trial we should be talking about the arson charges that's the discussion not this thing that's in the past that's you know it that's a that's his issue it's its jury doesn't need to hear about that and the judge very often will say yeah you're right you know what this is inadmissible well if the defense team or the defendant then proceeds to get up there and talk about it themselves well now all bets are off you've just admitted it into the conversation and so now the prosecution they get to run with it because you brought it up so what you can't do in the court of public opinion and also in in the in a court of law in both courts you can't bring something up or talk about it and then say well the other side they're not allowed to talk about this thing but I can know the moment you print it up you have submitted it for public conversation if you don't want it in the public and you don't want the public talking about it and you don't want to hear people's opinions about it don't bring it up but this is you know people will even aside from the sex issue you know in modern society this is a common tactic people will use it in pretty much any argument you know you'll be talking about something and you're talking just in general terms about this issue you know you're not using anyone's name you're not speaking specifically about anyone's individual situation and then what someone will come in do is they'll come into the conversation and they will just unload their their own personal details as it pertains to this general conversation and they'll say what are you talking about this is and then they'll just they'll just give you all the nitty 'greet tale nitty-gritty details of their own life that you didn't ask for and why do they do that because they think as soon as they attach their personal life to this issue well now you're not allowed to talk about it and they automatically win but people will get upset about at me because when they do that here's what I do well now I'm gonna give you my opinion on this personal detail you've just given me and then I'll say no I you know what I think you personally we're wrong with this or that situation and they'll say well how dare you it's none of your business why did you tell me then why did you bring it up I wasn't talking about you specifically you brought self into this well now I guess we're talking about you I didn't want to talk about you but you talked about you and I'm not gonna let you shut down the conversation so now okay let's talk about you you're wrong you personally in your life that's wrong so it's the same thing with you know if I'm walking down the street and I pass by strangers on the street I'm not I'm not running up to the strangers and saying hey what are you doing you're what kind of sex do you like having III don't do that because I don't care and I don't want to know it's none of my business if I ran up to you as just a stranger walking by you know we passed we we walked through the same aisle and Target or something and I and I came up to you and I said hey what what kind of sex do you have at home okay if I did that you hit you'd be well within your rights to slap me in the face because it's not my business but if you run up to me and say this is what I do do you think it's a perversion I'm well within my rights to say yeah I think it is I didn't want to know this information I really was I didn't have this in mind when I got up this morning to talk about this I'm just trying to shop I'm just here at you know I'm just I'm just trying to get some groceries and go home you've brought this up you have assaulted my eardrums with this information about you I didn't want to know it but now that we're here and we're talking about it here's my answer yes I think it's a perversion and it's the same principle applies if you're marching through the street announcing your sexual hobbies to the world declaring it I mean shoving it at everyone's face I mean you're walking down Main Street in a city just telling everyone kids and everyone guess what I do I get to have an opinion about it and it might be an opinion you don't like if you don't want to hear it then don't bring it up I'll say it again for the last time if you don't want to hear the public's opinion about your private life don't bring it up Pompeyo was smart to not fall into the trap and actually answer Booker's question but I you know as I said if someone asks me that and I'm not being put up for Secretary of State I don't see that happening anytime soon but if someone asked me that I would have no problem saying yes I think it's a perversion if you're asking me yeah I do think it that's what I think so we know that the left won't shut up about their sex life because sex is pleasure pleasure is the point of life therefore sex is the point of life but still a question kind of remains here and the question is all right so you're obsessed with it because this is to use the point of life and you find your identity in your sex life because you can't find it anywhere else but why why do you need affirmation though why why the interrogation about sodomy why the Marches why the celebration why are you wearing the costume with the vagina and everything else what what are you doing that for it's home it seems almost evangelical in the sense that you're trying to evangelize people into adopting your approach to sex which why now but here's the thing we're told all the time by the left and they'll kind of scoff and they'll say what yeah yeah we're not trying to turn you gay when I try to turn your kids gay that's not the point of a of a gay pride parade is it's not it's not to convince you to be gay and okay I believe you I think that that's not really primarily the point well then what is the point now for Christians are often accused of bible-thumping of hitting people over the head with their religion in their personal views on things but that's because Christianity is evangelical and yeah we're very upfront we are trying to convince you to be Christian for your own sake because we believe that in Christianity we you find in Christ the key to salvation and to eternal happiness and so not only do we feel perfectly fine telling people about it but we feel called we are called to tell people about it it would be pretty horrible for us if we thought we had the key to eternal unhappiness and we didn't tell you so you could disagree you could say we're wrong we're crazy fine I mean that's your opinion you're allowed to have that opinion but you it doesn't make any sense for you to be offended at us for telling you considering that part of our belief system is that through this you find eternal happiness in heaven so yes we are trying to convince you to be Christian but with the left with the sexual stuff they'll say no we're not trying to convince you to do any of this okay so what are you doing you have you already have the right to do whatever you want sexually so there's no sort of shortage of Rights what why what are you doing I think the answer is it's the same thing that motivates anyone who talks too much about themselves over shares dominates the conversation with irrelevant personal details it's always insecurity the person who goes around announcing I am so confident in my personal choices in my lifestyle I want to tell everyone about it that person is definitely not confident because that's not what confident people do a confident person is someone with quiet dignity someone who doesn't seek affirmation from the world because he doesn't need it and the feelings of the world are irrelevant to him so I'll announce my Christianity to the world because I do want you to be Christian for your own sake but as far as my personal life as a heterosexual married male I'm not talking about that and I'm not waving a flag saying I'm so proud of it I don't do that because I don't need your approval it doesn't matter I'm 100% confident in it and I have found fulfillment I don't need it doesn't matter to me I mean everyone in the world could think that my relationship with my wife is disgusting doesn't matter to me I don't care IIIi really doesn't it's I mean if everyone in the world thought that I would think well you're all pretty crazy but that's that's on you I'm not gonna go talking about it I'm not gonna go talking about it in the world because number one I don't need your affirmation it doesn't matter to me I'm a hundred percent confident number two to me it's an intimate private sacred thing and so I'm not gonna put it out there for public consumption I'm not gonna put it up there for public debate I'm not gonna use it in an argument as a bludgeon to beat my enemies with or as emotional blackmail I'm not gonna cheapen it like that I'm going to keep it to myself with my wife you know it's between me my wife and god that's all that's the real reason you don't see you know we talk people say well why aren't there any heterosexual pride parades I think for most people like myself anyway it's because I what would be what would be the point there's no appointment and also this is private it's for me it's not for anyone else so I think people are especially on the left you know that people are you know they're unfulfilled and they feel empty and they're not confident and for that reason I pity them and I've compassion for them and I pray for them but point remains the moment you bring this up the moment you grab a sign grab a flag take to the streets bring it up at a confirmation hearing whatever else you start beating people over the head with it shoving in their face 24/7 the moment you do that well whatever offensive opinions you hear as a result it's your fault brought it on yourself alright um we'll leave it there guys thank you for watching thanks for listening I'll talk to you tomorrow you
