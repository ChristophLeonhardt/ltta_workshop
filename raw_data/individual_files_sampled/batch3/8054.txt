THESE WILL CONTINUE TO TRICKLE IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS GOING INTO DAYS HEARINGS WITH AN OPEN MIND. HE SAID YESTERDAY HE COULD CHANGE HIS MIND ABOUT KAVANAUGH IF HE THOUGHT HE WAS GUILTY. THE HEARING WAS BARELY OVER WHEN HE TWEETED HIS SUPPORT FOR HIS PICK. WHITE HOUSE SPOKESPERSON FOR KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION IS HERE TO WEIGH IN ON HOW THINGS WENT ON. YOU WERE IN THE HEARING TODAY. THERE WERE SOME BREAKS ALONG THE WAY, AND WE HEARD THAT THERE WERE CONCERNS OF THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT HOW CREDIBLE DR. FORD WAS, THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE POTENTIALLY AN INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH. WHAT WAS THE MOOD IS THE DAY WENT ON IF YOU CAN TELL US? IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL DAY. THAT WAS PROBABLE IN THE ROOM. I THINK THE PRESIDENT SUMMED IT UP BEST. WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY, IT WAS POWERFUL. AND RIVETING. AND HONEST. I WAS SITTING THERE, SITTING TO THE LEFT OF ME WAS A FORMER GIRLFRIEND OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHO KNOWS HIM VERY WELL, THERE TO SUPPORT IT. TO MY RIGHT WAS ALYSSA MILANO, SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE SAYING. PLATES BE NOT IN A SENATE HEARING. WITH HER IN MY LINE OF SIGHT, I COULD SEE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S PARENTS, WHICH WAS TOUGH TO WATCH, TOUGH TO WATCH HIS MOM WATCH HER SON UNDERGO THIS. SHE WAS CHOKED UP A NUMBER OF TIMES. THAT WAS DIFFICULT. BUT IT WAS CLEAR BY THE END OF TODAY THAT WE REALLY LEARNED NOTHING NEW. WE STILL HAVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH CATEGORICALLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY DENYING DR. FORD'S ALLEGATIONS. IT'S NOT JUST HIM. IT'S EVERYONE ELSE TO DESCRIBE THE PARTY. THIS IS NOT A HE SAID-SHE SAID SITUATION. THIS IS A SHE SAID VERSUS WHAT FOUR PEOPLE HAVE SAID. Shannon: DO YOU FEEL SHE CAME ACROSS AS CREDIBLE? SHE WAS SYMPATHETIC, THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN MATT. SHE WAS EARNEST BUT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF INCONSISTENCIES IN HER TESTIMONY. FOR INSTANCE SHE SAID SHE COULD NOT NAME THE HEARING THIS PAST MONDAY AND HER ATTORNEY SAID THAT WAS BECAUSE SHE HAS A FEAR OF FLYING. SHE SAYS THAT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS INCIDENT. AND SO THEY ASKED FOR A FEW DAYS SO THAT SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO DRIVE TO WASHINGTON, D.C., FROM CALIFORNIA. Shannon: FROM HER LEGAL TEAM? WE HEARD THE RUMORS AND I WASN'T SURE THAT WAS COMING FROM. YOU SPEAKER YOUR LAWYERS, OBVIOUSLY, LEGAL TEAM. SO IT TURNS OUT, SHE TOOK A PLANE TO WASHINGTON, D.C., TO THE HEARING TODAY Shannon: ALSO TO COSTA RICA. SHE'S A WORLD TRAVELER. SHE REGULARLY TAKES PLANES, SHE CAN'T REMEMBER IF SHE SHOWED "THE WASHINGTON POST" REPORTER AT THE THERAPIST NOTES, A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. SHE ALSO SAID SHE WISHED THEY COULD HAVE COME TO CALIFORNIA. THEY BEING THE SENATE STAFF. CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY OFFERED A NUMBER OF TIMES. THE PUBLIC INFORMATION, THEY OFFER TO GO OUT THERE. THERE WERE GAPS. Shannon: REALLY QUICKLY, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAMMERED OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO BRETT KAVANAUGH SAYING, YOU ASKED THE WHITE HOUSE TO GET THIS FBI INVESTIGATION LAUNCHED. HE SAID, I'LL DO ANYTHING THE COMMITTEE WANTS ME TO DO. THEY ARE SAYING, NO, WE WANT YOU TO ASK IT UNTIL THE WHITE HOUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT. WHY IS THAT NOT HAPPENING? FROM THE WHITE HOUSE'S VIEWPOINT, I THOUGHT THEY WERE PUTTING JUDGE KAVANAUGH IN A COMPLETELY UNFAIR POSITION. IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU ARE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. YOU DON'T DIRECT INVESTIGATIONS INTO YOURSELF WHEN YOU ARE SAYING I'M INNOCENT. THIS BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. AS GOOD AS THE ME TOO MOVEMENT HAS BEEN, ME TOO DOES NOT REPLACE INNOCENT OF ALL PROVEN GUILTY. AS FAR AS THE FBI IS CONCERNED, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A 36 YOUR ALLEGATION. IT'S KIND OF OUT OF THEIR PURVIEW AT THIS POINT. ALL THEY WOULD BE DOING IS COMPILING STATEMENTS AND THOSE STATEMENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMPILED FROM THE KEY PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE, PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE WHO SAID THIS NEVER HAPPENED. AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT. Shannon: ONE OF THE KEY PLAYERS BEFORE WE GO, MARK JUDGE. FORGIVE ME FOR READING MY COMPUTER SCREEN, MIKE EMANUEL GOT A LETTER THAT HE SENT TO THE COMMITTEE AGAINST INCOME HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED, A RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC, CANCER SURVIVOR, STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. HE AVOIDS PUBLIC LEAVING, WE WERE FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL, HAVEN'T SPOKEN SEVERAL YEARS. I DO NOT RECALL THE EVENTS DESCRIBED BY DR. FORD IN HER
