EXECUTIVE ORDER. PETE: HE DIDN'T HAVE TO. HE DID BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE TO. ABBY: WE CAN DEBATE THAT. ED: WE WILL DEBATE THAT ALL MORNING IN TERMS OF WALKING IT BACK AND PRESIDENT DEALING WITH A MEDIA NARRATIVE SET NO MATTER HOW HE REACTED. LOOK WHAT "TIME" MAGAZINE HAD TO DO. THEY PUT OUT THIS COVER THAT TRIES TO FRAME THIS IN A WAY THAT IS OBVIOUSLY EXTREMELY NEGATIVE TO THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION. SCREAMING, CRYING 2-YEAR-OLD GIRL PRESIDENT OVER HER AS IF HE IS LITERALLY RIPPING HER FROM MOM WHEN, IN FACT "TIME" MAGAZINE HAS TO RUN A CORRECTION ABOUT THE STORY. THEY HAVEN'T CORRECTED THE PHOTO. THEY ARE STILL STANDING BEHIND THE IDEA THAT THIS STILL, IN THEIR EYES, TYPIFIES THE DEBATE. BUT THEY ARE ADMITTING NOW THAT THIS YOUNG GIRL, 2 YEARS OLD WAS NEVER SEPARATED FROM HER MOM. ABBY: WE ALL SAW THIS 2-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO CAME OVER FROM HONDURAS. COME TO FIND NOW SHE WASN'T SEPARATED FROM HER MOM. IN FACT, HER FATHER IS SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THIS. HERE'S WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT'S HE SAID YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW I FELT WHEN I SAW THAT PHOTO OF MY DAUGHTER. IT BROKE MY HEART. IT'S DIFFICULT AS A FATHER TO SEE THAT. BUT I KNOW NOW THAT THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER. THEY ARE SAFER NOW THAN THEY WERE MAKING THAT JOURNEY TO THE BORDER. SHE HAS BEEN WITH HER MOTHER THIS WHOLE TIME.

PETE: THEY'RE UNINTENTIONALLY MAKING THE REVERSE POINTS THAT INDEED, ACTUALLY HERE IN AMERICA SEPARATED NOT SEPARATED YOU ARE CARED FOR. THE LAWS MATTER. AND THE PERILOUS JOURNEY YOU PUT THEM ON IN MEXICO IS A ROLL OF THE DICE. ABBY: ALSO THE MESSAGE YOU CAN'T JUST SEE A PHOTO AND JUMP TO A NARRATIVE. SO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. IF WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT A PHOTO THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A TERRIBLE SITUATION, LET'S MAKE SURE WE BACK IT UP WITH SOME FACTS AND KNOW THE ACTUAL STORY BEHIND IT. ED: "TIME" MAGAZINE ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT HAD SOMEBODY SHOOT BACK AT ME NICE STANDING BEHIND YOUR FELLOW JOURNALISTS. I BASICALLY SAID HOW WHY STAND BEHIND BASICALLY A FAKE PHOTO. LIKE, THAT'S NOT STANDING BEHIND JOURNALISM IT'S SIMPLY NOT. PETE: YOU ARE STANDING FOR JOURNALISM, RIGHT? FRAME THE STORY ACCURATELY AND IF IN FACT, ABBY IS RIGHT WHAT SHE SAID A MINUTE AGO. WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT THE PRESIDENT DID WALK THIS BACK A BIT. HE HAD TO REVERSE HIMSELF BY SIGNING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. IF THE OTHER SIDE FROM THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT THEY
