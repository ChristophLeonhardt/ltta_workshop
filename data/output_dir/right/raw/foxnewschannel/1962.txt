WAKING UP AND CITY BY CITY,

AREA BY AREA, COUNTY BY

18
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:29,086
COUNTY WE ARE SEEING IT MAKE

19
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:33,390
NO MISTAKE, CALIFORNIA WILL

20
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,392
NOT TOLERATE LAWLESSNESS

21
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:35,726
ANYMORE.

22
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:37,828
AND WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS

23
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:39,096
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT

24
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:40,731
TAKING THIS AS A LEFT VS.

25
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:42,232
RIGHT ISSUE BUT AN ISSUE OF

26
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:42,566
SAFETY.

27
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:43,300
BUT I WILL SAY.

28
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,168
THIS THIS IS A CAUTIONARY

29
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:47,003
TALE TO THE DEMOCRATS.

30
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:49,906
YOU, DEMOCRATS, MADE THIS A

31
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:51,942
LEFT VS. RIGHT ISSUE BY

32
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:53,410
CHOOSING TO UPHOLD THE

33
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,578
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OVER

34
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:55,178
AMERICAN CITIZENS.

35
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:56,012
YOU CAUSED THIS.

36
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:57,481
AND NOW WHAT YOU ARE SEE

37
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:58,448
SOMETHING CALIFORNIA SAYING,

38
00:00:58,448 --> 00:00:59,449
YOU KNOW WHAT?

39
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:00,517
IF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS

40
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:01,685
STANDING UP FOR ILLEGAL

41
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:02,652
IMMIGRANTS OVER THE AMERICAN

42
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:02,986
PEOPLE.

43
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:04,754
I'M NOT SO SURE I SUPPORT

44
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:05,956
THAT PARTY ANYMORE.

45
00:01:05,956 --> 00:01:08,125
IF IT CAN HAPPEN IN

46
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,292
CALIFORNIA, OF ALL PLACES IT

47
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:11,728
CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE AND IT

48
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:12,162
WILL.

49
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:12,829
AINSLEY: TOMI, WHAT DO YOU

50
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:13,463
THINK ABOUT THIS STORY?

51
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:15,532
IT STARTED FIRST AT NYU.

52
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:16,967
NEW YORK UNIVERSITY VERY

53
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:19,269
LIBERAL SCHOOL AND NOW AT

54
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:20,036
RUTGERS, THEY HAVE THIS

55
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:20,871
CLASS WHERE THEY ARE

56
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,305
TRAINING THE STUDENTS WAYS

57
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:23,840
TO ASSESS UNDOCUMENTED

58
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,275
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

59
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:26,810
IT'S CALLED THE DREAM ZONE.

60
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,478
THEY'RE TEACHING THEM

61
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:30,881
PENDING LEGISLATION FOR DACA

62
00:01:30,881 --> 00:01:31,248
STUDENTS.

63
00:01:31,248 --> 00:01:32,549
THEY ARE TEACHING THEM THE

64
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:33,450
HISTORY OF IMMIGRATION IN

65
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,451
THE UNITED STATES AND

66
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,186
METHODS TO CHECK WHAT PEOPLE

67
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:38,121
ARE SAYING ABOUT

68
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:40,423
UNDOCUMENTED ILLEGALS ON

69
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:41,792
VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA SITES.

70
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,360
>> WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF

71
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,162
OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER

72
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:45,829
EDUCATION TAUGHT STUDENTS

73
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:47,030
ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND

74
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,998
IMMIGRATION LAW INSTEAD OF

75
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:49,199
HOW TO BREAK THAT LAW AND

76
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:51,401
HOW TO REINFORCE

77
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:53,103
LAWLESSNESS, LINE CUTTING

78
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:55,605
AND SALUTE

79
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:55,639
ABD SALUTE

80
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:55,672
ABSOSALUTE

81
00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:55,705
ABSOLULUTE

82
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:56,473
ABSOLUTETE

83
00:01:56,473 --> 00:01:56,840
ABSOLUTE LUNANCY?

84
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,307
LOOK AT THIS.

85
00:01:57,307 --> 00:01:59,042
WE KNOW THAT COLLEGE

86
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:01,278
CAMPUSES ARE THE LAST

87
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:02,646
BASTION THE LEFT HAS THIS IS

88
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:03,580
THEIR STRONG HOLD.

89
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,714
THEY ARE MOVING FURTHER AND

90
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:05,916
FURTHER TO THE LEFT.

91
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,284
HOWEVER, BY DOING THIS, AS I

92
00:02:07,284 --> 00:02:08,217
SAID WITH CALIFORNIA, THEY

93
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:09,318
ARE ONLY PUSHING PEOPLE TO

94
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:09,853
CENTER RIGHT.

95
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:11,721
SO WHEN THEY CONTINUE TO DO

96
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:13,356
THIS, THEY CONTINUE TO

97
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:14,658
CODDLE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

98
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:17,727
AND CONTINUE TO LAWLESSNESS

99
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:18,428
ALL THEY ARE DOING IS

100
00:02:18,428 --> 00:02:19,162
HELPING OUR CAUSE.

101
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:19,930
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

102
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,964
GOING TO WAKE UP TO THIS

103
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:24,401
BECAUSE THIS IS UTTERLY

104
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:24,935
RIDICULOUS.

105
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:25,735
PETE: SPEAKING OF THAT CAUSE

106
00:02:25,735 --> 00:02:26,803
KEITH ELLISON THE DEPUTY

107
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:27,370
CHAIRMAN OF THE DNC.

108
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,806
THE NUMBER TWO GUY, HE WAS

109
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:31,942
CAUGHT WEARING THIS T-SHIRT

110
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:33,643
AT AN EVENT.

111
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:35,478
THAT'S SPANISH.

112
00:02:35,478 --> 00:02:38,915
I CAN'T PRONOUNCE THAT.

113
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:40,183
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

114
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:42,552
>> TRANSLATES TO I DO NOT

115
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:45,322
BELIEVE IN BORDERS CAUSE

116
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:47,557
PUSHED BY OPEN BORDER

117
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:47,891
GROUPS.

118
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:48,725
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS WE

119
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:49,326
WANT A WALL.

120
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:50,360
WE BELIEVE IN SOVEREIGNTY IN

121
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,194
OUR NATION.

122
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:52,028
WITHOUT BORDERS YOU DON'T

123
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:54,231
HAVE A COUNTRY, IS HE NOT

124
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:55,498
FAIRLY ARTICULATING THE FACT

125
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:57,901
THAT THE MODERN LEFT LED BY

126
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:58,802
OUR LEADERSHIP DOESN'T

127
00:02:58,802 --> 00:02:59,369
BELIEVE IN BORDERS.

128
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:00,570
>> OF COURSE, WELCOME AS YOU

129
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,371
SAID TO THE MODERN

130
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:01,872
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

131
00:03:01,872 --> 00:03:03,139
AND IT'S A PARTY THAT WILL

132
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:03,840
CONTINUE TO LOSE.

133
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,876
BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE KEITH

134
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:07,010
ELLISON WHO PREACH OPEN

135
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:07,344
BORDERS.

136
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:08,678
BUT I DO HAVE TO GIVE IT TO

137
00:03:08,678 --> 00:03:10,647
HIM AND OTHERS ON THE LEFT

138
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:11,615
BECAUSE FINALLY THEY ARE

139
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:12,449
SHOWING THEIR CARDS.

140
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:13,850
THEY ARE SAYING WE ARE NOT

141
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,085
GOING TO BEAT AROUND THE

142
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:15,852
BUSH ANYMORE.

143
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:17,287
WE ARE FOR OPEN BORDERS AND

144
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:18,088
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

145
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:19,055
I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

146
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:20,023
ARE TAKING NOTE.

147
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:20,757
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

148
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:22,158
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THIS

149
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:23,693
COUNTRY IS TELLING YOU

150
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:25,195
EXACTLY WHAT THEY STAND FOR.

151
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:26,796
AND IF THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU

152
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:28,198
STAND FOR, WELL, I GUESS

153
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:29,266
THAT'S NOT THE PARTY FOR

154
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:31,902
YOU.

155
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:33,303
PETE: ABOLITION OF NATIONAL

156
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:33,703
BORDERS.

157
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:34,404
STEVE: MAKING IT VERY CLEAR

158
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:37,140
WE HAD SOME PRIMARIES

159
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,174
YESTERDAY SCATTERED ACROSS

160
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:39,242
THE NORTHEAST YESTERDAY,

161
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:39,576
TOMI.

162
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,011
IT'S VERY CLEAR IT WILL BE

163
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:42,445
TO VOTERS IN NOVEMBER WHICH

164
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:43,546
PARTY ARE YOU FOR?

165
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:44,748
ARE YOU FOR THE OPEN

166
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:45,649
BORDERS, TAKE BACK THE

167
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:49,286
CRUMBS PARTY OR THE OTHER

168
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:50,620
PARTY WHICH YOU KNOW EXACTLY

169
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,656
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE SO FAR?

170
00:03:52,656 --> 00:03:55,258
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASY

171
00:03:55,258 --> 00:00:00,000
CHOICE FOR ME, GUYS.
