Female Democratic candidates
won historic nominations
in elections in
Southern states.
“What happened
tonight is amazing.”
“I’m honored to be
here at this moment.”
“We are writing the next
chapter of Georgia’s future.”
In Georgia, Stacey Abrams
became the first black woman
to be a major party
nominee for governor
in the United States.
“I am so grateful to the
thousands of you in this room
and around this state
and around this country
who have joined me on
this drive to history.”
She got more than 75% of the
vote over her challenger.
And there were others, too.
In Texas, a former Dallas
county sheriff, Lupe Valdez,
became the state’s first
Latina and first gay nominee
for governor.
And Gina Ortiz Jones, an
Iraq war veteran and daughter
of a Filipino immigrant,
became the first lesbian
and woman of color to win
a nomination for Congress.
“When Houston families are
threatened, we fight back.”
Lizzie Pannill Fletcher also
won a hard-fought nomination
for a House seat in a
state that isn’t known
for nominating many women.
“When I was 12 years old,
I knew exactly what I
wanted to do when I grew up.”
In Kentucky, Amy McGrath,
the first female Marine
to fly an F-18
fighter jet in combat,
defeated the Democratic
establishment’s
favored candidate to become
the nominee for another seat
in the U.S. House.
Some of these candidates
were backed by the national
Democratic Party.
But other victories
came as a surprise.
“— a stronger and fairer Texas.”
In November’s midterm
elections, all of these women
will be running against
male opponents,
most of them white.
They will also be
running in traditionally
Republican states
and districts.
So the midterms will tell how
much demographic, economic
and social forces
are shifting politics
in conservative
parts of America.
The Democratic Party has been
struggling to define itself —
“Thank you.”
— after the 2016
presidential loss.
But these campaigns
now give it
a chance to try out a
political strategy ahead
of 2020 —
energizing a coalition of
young and nonwhite voters
with a progressive
message instead of
trying to win back
rural white voters.
“I wish the election
were today.
I think we would win
overwhelmingly today.
But it’s not today.
So we just take it one
district at a time.”
