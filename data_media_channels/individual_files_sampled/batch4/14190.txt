well you know you're in a position where you don't know the answers with you any further you need to leave okay do you understand that do you understand that you need to leave we have tried various context but we haven't heard and we're trying to find out who is kicking us out here sir it's been explained to you that you're not welcome here for the convention why is that sir you'd have to ask the convention that this is kind of like an Abbott and Costello who's on first we've been trying for days so ultimately sir you'll have to speak to the convention about why you're not allowed to be here who would that be what would be the name of the person can tell you that you're not allowed to be on the property so I'm asking you to leave so you're asking them to leave the hotel itself that's what I've just said and sorry and who are you you are hotel security manager and why are we being asked to leave the hotel you're not welcome here I've already explained that to you and but we are members of the press here we're trying to cover this but you haven't been registered that's up to the party not to the hotel I see every other media outlet allowed in why are we not allowed to sir I can't answer that question for you I don't work for the capisi party well you know this just goes to prove folks what a complete and utter fiasco this leadership convention has been from mailed out ballots that never arrived to pin numbers that don't work to people being prevented or locked out from going on a computer system here we are a member of the press trying to cover a convention and you see we have these fine gentlemen here telling us not only are we not welcome on the convention floor we have to leave the property I'm the security for the event and I'm asking you politely to live he's the security of the hotel and he's asking you to leave the hotel property and at the moment you're considered trespassing trespassing the security manager for the hotel so a PC party honcho has sent a text and basically it was a little cryptic it said sorry what you guys did in Ottawa made it impossible for us to come here and cover the conference so I don't know we did in Ottawa we ask some questions I have a feeling mr. Mulrooney maybe didn't like one of my questions and if you missed the report folks here's what I asked her mr. Solomon has been very vocal in the past about his love for Sharia financing I'm curious if you support that kind of initiative and also if you can enlighten us why your father wrote a letter to The Globe and Mail some years back where he was actually praising Saudi Arabia as our friends and allies I well lead Solomon and my father work at the same law firm and they're both partners there I have no comments on any letters that and either of them have written and I'm happy to talk about ideas that are before me as a leadership candidate for the PC Party of Ontario familiar with that letter that was published in The Globe and Mail by your father praising Saudi Arabia a country where you potentially the Premier of Ontario wouldn't be allowed to drive a car or vote or go outside without a male chaperone my father has and a lot of people are doing a lot of great business with Saudi Arabia I have no comments to make well as you can see folks the security guard who was just following orders and where have we heard that one before is talking to the police and evidently referred to us as not real media I guess that comes to a bit of a surprise to the almost 900,000 subscribers of rebel dot media but as you can see they've they've called in for reinforcements so they asses a leave will obey the law of course we will leave but nevertheless this remains an absolute outrage and part of the outrage is nobody upstairs part of the PC party nobody has the spine to come down and tell us face-to-face that we're out of here and give us a reason why we can't come and cover a convention that might be producing the next premiere of this province I just wanted to tell you that we were only here to cover this as members of the media how perverse is that a conservative media outlet is booted out of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership convention first down the floor then outside the building and apparently this is not good enough the fine officers of York Regional Police have informed us we have to get to the sidewalk it's not their fault folks they're just following the orders and we're gonna try to arrange some other credentials to get in and see if we can actually cover this convention you
