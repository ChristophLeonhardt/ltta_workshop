1
00:00:02,321 --> 00:00:06,259
WE HAVE A LOT TO GET TO TONIGHT.

2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:08,060
HE'S BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,562
ALL THIS, LINDSEY GRAHAM.

4
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:15,234
WELCOME, IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK.

5
00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:17,003
TO ME THIS IS SERIOUS.

6
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:19,472
WHAT WAS THE DEAL ON FRIDAY?

7
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:21,274
>> HERE'S THE DEAL.

8
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:22,942
SENATOR FLAKE VOTED YES ON THE

9
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:23,843
COMMITTEE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING

10
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:26,879
THAT SHE WOULD LIKE THE FBI TO

00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,715
INTERVIEW THE 340 WITNESSES THAT

12
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:29,549
WERE INTERVIEWED BY THE

13
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:35,989
REPUBLICAN ON THE COMMITTEE.

14
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:43,630
PJ, MRS. LELAND, AND MARK JUDGE.

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,031
LISA MURKOWSKI SET OUT THAT THE

16
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:46,733
FBI TO TRY TO CHECK THE

17
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:49,469
COMMITTEE'S HOMEWORK AND BE ALSO

18
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:50,236
AGREED TO INTERVIEW MRS. RAMIREZ

19
00:00:50,236 --> 00:00:54,040
WITH THE ALLEGATIONS.

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,041
>> Hannity: THAT WAS THE

21
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,443
NEW YORKER?

22
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:59,612
>> RIGHT.

23
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:02,882
IF THEY WON'T FURTHER INTERVIEW,

24
00:01:02,882 --> 00:01:04,083
THEY WILL SIT DOWN WITH

25
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:04,950
SENATOR McCONNELL AND SEE WHAT

26
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,485
THEY CAN WORK OUT.

27
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:07,153
THEY HAD A DEAL FOR A WEEK, WE

28
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:09,923
LIMITED THE INTERVIEWS TWO,

29
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:12,692
THREE PEOPLE NAMED BY DR. FORD.

30
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:14,794
WE WILL SEE WITH THE FBI FINDS.

31
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:16,463
>> Hannity: IT IS NOW BEEN

32
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:16,896
EXPANDED OUT?

33
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:19,566
THE PRESIDENT SAID.

34
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:22,068
>> NO IT IS NOT.

35
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:23,536
THIS IS A REQUEST OUT OF

36
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:23,870
SIGNAGE.

37
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,842
NOBODY ASKED TO DO THIS.

38
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:31,277
NOBODY ASKED FOR THAT.

39
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:31,945
NOT ONE DEMOCRAT ASKED THE

40
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:33,046
QUESTION.

41
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:34,014
THE SENATORS ENGLISH AND DID NOT

42
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:36,983
FEEL THAT WAS NECESSARY.

43
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:37,751
IT MAKES NO SENSE

44
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:41,855
LET ME GO OVER IT AGAIN.

45
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:44,624
THE DOCTOR FORD WITNESSES, MARK

46
00:01:44,624 --> 00:01:47,427
JUDGE, LELAND, AND PJ.

47
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:48,461
AND MRS. RAMIREZ.

48
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:50,297
THAT SAID, DO IT WITHIN A WEEK,

49
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:51,932
REPORT BACK TO THE SENATE AND

50
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:56,036
WILL MOVE FORWARD.

51
00:01:56,036 --> 00:01:57,838
NBC NEWS JUST RAN THIS

52
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:58,205
INTERVIEW.

53
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:03,076
>> Hannity: NOT ONLY WAS ONE

54
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:04,211
PERSON TO HEADSET, SHE CHANGED

55
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:04,578
THE STORY.

56
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:07,648
SHE WAS SAYING THAT IT WAS

57
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:08,148
SYSTEMATICALLY --

58
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:09,583
EVERY WEEKEND.

59
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,452
>> WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS IN

60
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:13,453
ABOUT 30 SECONDS.

61
00:02:13,453 --> 00:02:15,355
WHAT REASONABLE PERSON WOULD GO

62
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:18,592
TO A PARTY, WITNESS DRUGGING OF

63
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:22,796
WOMEN, GANG RAPE AND GO BACK.

64
00:02:22,796 --> 00:02:25,832
I NEVER TELL ANYBODY.

65
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:26,700
>> Hannity: AND NOW SHE IS

66
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,836
SAYING, SAID THAT HE PUT IT IN

67
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:30,637
THE PUNCH.

68
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:32,239
HE WAS NEAR THE PUNCH.

69
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,109
WHAT IS NBC RUN THIS?

70
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:40,614
>> THERE WAS AN ANONYMOUS LETTER

71
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:42,816
RECEIVED BY CORY GARDNER, THE

72
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,352
SENATOR FROM COLORADO WITH NO

73
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:47,621
RETURN ADDRESS, JUST A LETTER.

74
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:48,822
IT ACCUSED BRETT KAVANAUGH OF

75
00:02:48,822 --> 00:02:49,590
ASSAULTING SOMEBODY IN A

76
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,393
RESTAURANT IN 1998 IN COLORADO.

77
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:54,962
CORY HANDED TO THE COMMITTEE AND

78
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:56,763
SOMEBODY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE

79
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:57,865
LEAKED THAT A LETTER.

80
00:02:57,865 --> 00:03:00,133
I GOT ON THE NBC NIGHTLY NEWS.

81
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:04,471
THE FOURTH ALLEGATION.

82
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:05,672
>> Hannity: THE FIFTH AND

83
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:06,106
RHODE ISLAND.

84
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:08,075
>> TO THINK NBC WOULD HAVE DONE

85
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:10,878
THAT IF IT WAS A DEMOCRATIC MALE

86
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:11,211
NOMINEE?

87
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:14,615
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THE

88
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:16,049
JOURNALIST INTEGRITY HAS BEEN

89
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:16,917
DESTROYED OVER THIS CASE.

90
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,619
>> Hannity: ALL RIGHT.

91
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:22,656
IT IS A VERY TIGHT MARGIN IN THE

92
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:23,023
SENATE.

93
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:24,558
>> ANY OF JEFF FLAKE.

94
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:25,225
>> Hannity: WHO KNOWS WHAT

95
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:28,228
JEFF FLAKE IS SAYING.

96
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:28,595
WHO KNOWS.

97
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:31,665
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, YOU FALL

98
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:34,201
ONE VOTE SHORT.

99
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:36,237
>> NUMBER ONE, I DON'T THINK WE

100
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:36,537
WILL.

101
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:38,038
I WILL TELL YOU WHY, I DON'T

102
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:39,940
THINK WE WILL FIND ANYTHING NEW

103
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,942
FROM THE SUPPLEMENT ON THE FBI

104
00:03:41,942 --> 00:03:44,979
INVESTIGATION TO TAKE JEFF FROM

105
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:48,849
YES, TO KNOW.

106
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,251
I THINK THE TWO SENATORS WANT TO

107
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:52,019
MAKE SURE THAT THE FBI DID THEIR

108
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:52,653
HOMEWORK, THEY CHECKED THE

109
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:54,855
COMMITTEE'S WORK.

110
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:55,856
BUT HER WORK WAS GOOD.

111
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:58,659
I THINK THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL

112
00:03:58,659 --> 00:03:59,260
ABOUT.

113
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,994
WE'RE NOT EXPANDING AT ALL THIS

114
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:02,229
CRAZY STUFF.

115
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:04,198
NOW, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF

116
00:04:04,198 --> 00:04:05,600
SOMETHING REALLY WEIRD DID

117
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:05,900
OCCUR.

118
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,936
WE ARE ONE VOTE SHORT.

119
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:11,339
HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO, I WOULD

120
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:13,041
APPEAL THE VERDICT TO THE BALLOT

121
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:13,307
BOX.

122
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:17,644
THIS GOOD MAN SHOULD NOT BE

123
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:18,546
DESTROYED IF YOU LEGITIMIZE THIS

124
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:20,615
PROCESS BY ONE VOTE SHORT.

125
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:21,682
WE WILL BE ON TO THE NEXT

126
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:22,250
PERSON.

127
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,418
I WOULD HATE TO BE THE NEXT

128
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:25,620
PERSON NOMINATED.

129
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,922
I WOULD FEEL HORRIBLE THAT WE

130
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:28,890
DESTROYED BRETT KAVANAUGH.

131
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,024
WHAT WOULD I DO?

132
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:32,627
I WOULD RENOMINATE HIM AND I

133
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:34,996
WOULD TAKE THIS CASE TO THE

134
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:37,098
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND VOTERS IN

135
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:38,433
INDIANA AND MISSOURI AND

136
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:40,635
NORTH DAKOTA AND OTHER PLACES

137
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:43,404
WHERE TRUMP ONE SAYING WHO HE

138
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:44,005
WOULD NOMINATE IF HE GOT

139
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:47,375
PRESIDENT AND SEE IF VOTERS WANT

140
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,544
TO APPEAL THE VERDICT.

141
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:51,012
>> Hannity: YOU ARE SAYING IF

142
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:51,846
YOU FALL ONE VOTE SHORT, YOU ARE

143
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:55,049
SAYING THAT I WOULD APPEAL THE

144
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:57,752
CASE.

145
00:04:57,886 --> 00:05:00,889
>>  THE PRESIDENT SHOULD RENOMIN

146
00:05:00,889 --> 00:04:55,383
>>  THE PRESIDENT SHOULD RENOMIT

147
00:04:55,383 --> 00:05:00,922
FOR THIS ELECTION?

148
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:01,155
>>  THE PRESIDENT SHOULD RENOMI?

149
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:03,858
>> ONE YOU WOULD BE LEGITIMIZING

150
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:04,826
DESTRUCTION OF A HORRIBLE

151
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:06,628
PERSON, I MEAN A HORRIBLE

152
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:10,131
PROCESS AT A GOOD PROP MIKE

153
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:15,236
PERSON.

154
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:15,970
>> Hannity: THIS WOULD BE A

155
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,371
REFERENDUM?

156
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:19,040
>> THIS WOULD BE AN APPEAL FROM

157
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,742
A POLITICAL BODY TO THE PEOPLE

158
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:23,444
WHO PUT US HERE AND SEE IF THESE

159
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:24,178
TRUMP STATES THAT ELECTED

160
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:25,513
PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD DO EXACTLY

161
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:27,982
WHAT HE IS DOING ON CUTTING

162
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:28,316
TAXES.

163
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:30,418
IF THEY ARE OKAY WITH THE

164
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:31,119
DECISION OF THEIR SENATOR, I

165
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:33,354
DON'T THINK WE WILL GET THERE.

166
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:34,722
I THINK WE WILL GET 50 PLUS BUT

167
00:05:34,722 --> 00:05:36,090
IF WE FELL ONE VOTE SHORT FOR

168
00:05:36,090 --> 00:00:00,000
THE GOOD OF THE NATION, I WOULD
