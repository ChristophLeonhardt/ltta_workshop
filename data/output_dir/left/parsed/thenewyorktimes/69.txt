This is what
genocide looks like.
In 2017, Myanmar
security forces
killed thousands of Rohingya,
including young children.
They raped women and girls
and tortured men and boys.
They burned
hundreds of villages
in a systematic campaign.
More than 700,000 Rohingya
escaped into Bangladesh
in the fastest refugee outflow
since the Rwandan genocide.
Through footage stored on
cell phones of survivors,
evidence of genocide in
Myanmar is still emerging.
The memory of
unspeakable horrors
locked on digital screens.
These phones are often damaged
during the perilous trip
to Bangladesh.
But this group of
refugees repairs them,
sometimes for money,
sometimes for free.
Using a small generator,
basic soldering equipment,
and a toothbrush, theyâ€™re
working tirelessly
to fix Rohingya phones.
Footage like this, of the
ongoing genocide in Myanmar,
could one day be
used as evidence
to prosecute perpetrators.
For Rohingya refugees,
shooting video
is extremely risky.
A new report by
Fortify Rights shows
how the Myanmar military
systematically prepared
for these atrocities.
It names 22 army
and police officials
who should be
criminally investigated.
The U.N. Security Council
should immediately
refer the situation in Myanmar
to the International Criminal Court
and end
these atrocities.
