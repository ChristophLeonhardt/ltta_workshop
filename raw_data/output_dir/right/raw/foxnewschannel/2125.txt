1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,112
THE BORDER $5 MARGARITAS.

2
00:00:02,112 --> 00:00:05,282
>> CAN'T BELIEVE I DON'T ALREADY

3
00:00:05,282 --> 00:00:15,292
HAVE A T-SHIRT.

4
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:15,792
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

5
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:16,493
GETTING A MAMMOGRAM AT AGE 40

6
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:17,160
MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH IN THE

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,762
BATTLE AGAINST BREAST CANCER,

8
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:19,396
THE COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY

9
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:20,630
RECOMMENDS THEM AND RECEIVE

10
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,566
BREAST CANCER SCREENING AT AGE

11
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:30,440
30 SO WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,812
I SAW THIS NEWS EARLIER THIS

13
00:00:35,812 --> 00:00:36,546
WEEK, PEOPLE NEED TO BE AWARE OF

14
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:38,081
THIS.

15
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:40,550
WHY DID THE AGE CHANGE?

16
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,653
>> NOT NECESSARILY GETTING

17
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:51,962
MAMMOGRAMS AT 30 BUT BEING

18
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:52,662
EVALUATED FOR RISK FACTORS BY

19
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:53,396
AGE 30, THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF

20
00:00:53,396 --> 00:00:54,130
RADIOLOGY AND SOCIETY OF BREAST

21
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,131
IMAGING, THEY SAID WE NEED TO

22
00:00:55,131 --> 00:01:02,439
EVALUATE WOMEN BY THE AGE OF 30

23
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,109
TO DETERMINE IF THEY NEED BREAST

24
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:06,843
CANCER SCREENING BEFORE THE AGE

25
00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:07,577
OF 30 BUT THE OTHER THING THEY

26
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:12,916
NOTED IS AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN

27
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:13,650
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A HIGH RISK

28
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,384
SUBSET BECAUSE AFRICAN-AMERICAN

29
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:20,023
WOMEN, THE SAME INCIDENCE AND

30
00:01:20,023 --> 00:01:20,724
OCCURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER,

31
00:01:20,724 --> 00:01:21,458
TEND TO HAVE MORE SEVERE CASES

32
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,192
AND DIE MORE FROM IT SO THAT IS

33
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:26,062
ANOTHER SIGN THESE GUIDELINES

34
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:26,363
HAVE.

35
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:31,568
>> I'M 35 AND HAVE NOT THOUGHT

36
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:32,302
ABOUT THIS YET BECAUSE I THOUGHT

37
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:34,537
I WOULD WAIT UNTIL 40.

38
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:35,272
WHAT SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SHOULD

39
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:44,948
WE BE LOOKING FOR AND ASKING OUR

40
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:45,215
DR.?

41
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:46,082
>> A LOT OF WOMEN, MYSELF

42
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:46,816
INCLUDED, IT GETS CONFUSING WITH

43
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:47,784
THE GUIDELINES THE CHANGE ALL

44
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:48,518
TIME BUT I DON'T WANT WOMEN TO

45
00:01:48,518 --> 00:01:51,021
GET CONFUSED.

46
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:56,126
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RISK

47
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:59,095
FACTORS, IF YOU HAVE A PERSONAL

48
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:03,300
HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER MAYBE

49
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,034
YOU HAD RADIATION, DENSE BREASTS

50
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:07,037
OR CERTAIN GENETIC FACTORS THAT

51
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:10,106
COULD MAKE YOU HAVE HIGH-RISK.

52
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:17,047
TALK WITH YOUR DOCTOR EARLY TO

53
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:17,647
DETERMINE WHAT YOU NEED.

54
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:18,281
KERRIMAC WHAT ABOUT THIS

55
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:21,551
WEEDKILLER THAT IS IN TONS OF

56
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:22,185
FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES?

57
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:25,255
WHAT IS THIS?

58
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:26,957
>> THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING

59
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:27,257
ABOUT.

60
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:37,834
A CHEMICAL WE SEE IN A LOT OF

61
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:38,568
HERBICIDES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

62
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:39,269
AND TO FIND OUT HOW COMMONLY

63
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:41,171
USED THE SUBSTANCE IS, THERE ARE

64
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:49,079
A LOT OF REPORTS ABOUT SAFETY

65
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,113
AND HOW THIS AFFECTS PEOPLE AND

66
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:52,816
MAY AFFECT PEOPLE DOWN THE LINE.

67
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:57,754
ACADEMICIANS AND OTHER

68
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:58,421
INDUSTRIES AND CONFLICTING

69
00:02:58,421 --> 00:02:58,755
REPORTS.

70
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:01,725
THERE IS GOOD RESEARCH ABOUT

71
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:06,663
THIS CHEMICAL BUT THE OTHER

72
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:07,397
THING, THE OTHER CHEMICALS USED

73
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:10,900
ALONG WITH IT MAY POSE RISKS AS

74
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,201
WELL.

75
00:03:11,201 --> 00:00:00,000
WE NEED A LOT OF INFORMATION.
