REX TILLERSON IS ALSO SALTY
ABOUT ALL OF THIS, LET'S
HEAR FROM HIM.
>>DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE
OVERWHELMING VOTES IN CONGRESS
TO PASS THAT WAS A SIGN THAT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT RUSSIA
TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE THE
RELATIONSHIP?
>>I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WANT THE TWO MOST POWERFUL
NUCLEAR NATIONS IN THE WORLD TO
HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP.
I
DON'T THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WANT US TO HAVE A BAD
RELATIONSHIP WITH A HUGE NUCLEAR
POWER, BUT I THINK THEY ARE
FRUSTRATED.
I TOLD PRESIDENT
PUTIN IN MARCH, AND I TOLD
FOREIGN MINISTER LAVROV
REPEATEDLY, THE SITUATION IS BAD
BUT IT COULD GET WORSE.
AND IT
JUST DID, WITH THE ACTION BY THE
CONGRESS TO PUT THESE SANCTIONS
IN PLACE AND THE WAY THEY DID
IT.
NEITHER THE PRESIDENT NOR I
ARE HAPPY ABOUT THAT, WE WERE
CLEAR THAT WE DIDN'T THINK IT
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO OUR EFFORTS,
BUT THAT'S THE DECISION THEY
MADE, THEY MADE IT IN AN
OVERWHELMING WAY.
>>LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT A BUNCH
OF THINGS.
NUMBER ONE, REX
TILLERSON IS TELLING YOU WE
DIDN'T WANT TO SIGN IT, WE HAD
NO CHOICE.
LATER WHEN HE SAYS WE
SIGNED THE SANCTIONS BILL, WE
TAKE CREDIT FOR IT, REMEMBER
WHEN THEY SAID THEY HATED IT.
THEY LOBBIED AGAINST IT, AND IN
USUAL TRUMP STYLE, IT WAS
COMPLETELY INEFFECTUAL.
WHEN
IT'S THAT BIPARTISAN IT SEEMS
CLEAR WHAT AMERICA'S
REPRESENTATIVES WANT, BUT
NONETHELESS TILLERSON IS NOW A
POLITICIAN, HE SAYS I WILL MAKE
UP WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WANT, THEY WANT WHAT I DO.
THEY
DIDN'T VOTE THAT WAY.
HE IS
LIKE, THEY WANT US TO LIFT THOSE
SANCTIONS SO EXXON MOBIL CAN
MAKE THAT DEAL -- DID YOU JUST
MAKE THAT UP?
MOST IMPORTANT AT
ALL, HE HAS A DOG IN THE FIGHT.
HE WAS CEO OF EXXON MOBIL, THE
NUMBER ONE DEAL AFFECTED BY THE
SANCTIONS IS A $500 MILLION DEAL
WITH EXXON MOBIL THAT RUSSIA
HAD.
THE WHOLE POINT OF
TILLERSON COMING IN WAS TO LIFT
THOSE SANCTIONS.
TILLERSON GOT A
MEDAL FROM PUTIN, AND THE GUY
WHO OWNS THE LARGEST OIL COMPANY
IN RUSSIA, ONE OF THE OLIGARCHS,
THE SANCTIONS WERE PLACED ON HIM
AS WELL, HE CAN'T COME BACK IN
THE U.S., HE'S LIKE, I DON'T
LIKE THE SANCTIONS BECAUSE OF
THE ECONOMIC STUFF BUT I ALSO
WANT TO COME BACK TO AMERICA SO
I CAN RIDE MOTORCYCLES WITH MY
BEST FRIEND REX TILLERSON.
OF
COURSE TILLERSON AND TRUMP DON'T
WANT TO DO SANCTIONS, BECAUSE
THEY WANT THEM LIFTED.
TRUMP
OWES THE RUSSIANS, AND
TILLERSON, WHY DID HE GIVE UP
BEING CEO TO DO SOME SECRETARY
OF STATE THINK HE HAS NO
INTEREST IN?
TO LIFT THE SANCTIONS.
>>WHITE DEMOCRATS KEEP HARPING
ABOUT THIS?
BY THE WAY,
DEMOCRATS AREN'T, WE ARE HARPING
ON IT.
IT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT
MEANS THEY WILL FOCUS ON
POLICIES THAT BENEFIT THEMSELVES
AND THEIR CORPORATE BUDDIES
INSTEAD OF POLICIES THAT BENEFIT
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
