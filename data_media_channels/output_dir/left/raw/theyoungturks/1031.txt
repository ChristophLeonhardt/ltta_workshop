1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:04,400
"You want me to say on television
that I support arming 3 and 4 year olds?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,535
Is that what you're asking?"

3
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:08,339
"Uhh yes."

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,112
"Typically members of congress don'’t just
hear a story about a program and indicate

5
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,113
if they support it or not."

6
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:17,020
"I support the kinderguardian program. 
We in america would be wise to

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,887
implement it too."

8
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:20,759
"Rocket ship rpg will take you to the moon."

9
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:24,431
"The bad guys are going to the
moon if they attack your school

10
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:27,135
with big scary fireworks."

11
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:32,777
"A 3 year old cannot defend itself
from an assault rifle by throwing a

12
00:00:32,777 --> 00:00:34,613
hello kitty pencil case at it."

13
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:37,518
"This lunchbox and push it
into it’s tummy like this."

14
00:00:37,518 --> 00:00:43,962
"Just remember to point puppy pistols mouth
right at the middle of the bad man."

15
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:47,299
Conservatives, arming
3-year-olds to own the libs.

16
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:49,837
This is the mentality of
Republican congressmen.

17
00:00:49,837 --> 00:00:52,140
And it’s f**king terrifying.

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:59,118
Putting guns in the hands of law 
abiding citizens whether it be teachers

19
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:03,257
or whether they actually be
talented children or highly

20
00:01:03,257 --> 00:01:04,593
trained pre-schoolers.

21
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:08,366
In his latest act of comedic genius,
Sacha Baron Cohen goes undercover

22
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:14,442
as anti-terror expert Erran Morad, and 
effortlessly dupes countless Republicans into

23
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:18,749
supporting a campaign to arm
children in America.

24
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:22,655
Now, while most sane people would
be outraged that government officials

25
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:26,794
support stuffed animal pistols, that group
of sane people doesn’t seem to include a

26
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:28,998
vast majority of conservatives in America.

27
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:33,638
Who, rather than comment on their fellow
Republicans’ mind blowing absurdity, instead

28
00:01:33,638 --> 00:01:37,879
voiced their outrage at Cohen’s disguise 
and his ‘disgusting’ techniques.

29
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:41,684
Like let’s just break this down into 
even simpler terms shall we.

30
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,488
People in this country are
more upset at a comedian being a

31
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:47,794
comedian than they are at
congressmen saying they want to

32
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:50,064
put grenades in lunchboxes.

33
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,835
What’s next, will conservatives
be more outraged at a comedian

34
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:55,639
making fun of Sarah Huckabee
Sanders’ eyeliner than the

35
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:59,011
actual president who disparages
woman on a daily basis?

36
00:01:59,011 --> 00:01:59,846
Wait yeah.

37
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:02,817
I mean what’s next, will they be more
outraged at a black man peacefully

38
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:07,191
kneeling in protest than a group of armed
white vigilantes who engaged the

39
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:09,426
FBI in a 30 day standoff oh wait?

40
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:10,094
You get the picture.

41
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,999
One of those endorsing
kindergrenaders was former

42
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,570
republican congressman Joe
Walsh, who you may know him as

43
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,641
the guy who hates muslims as
much as he hates paying child support.

44
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:22,614
Well, unsurprisingly, he fell hook, line and
sinker, to the point where he’s shown

45
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:25,452
gleefully endorsing the made up program.

46
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:31,161
Specially selected children 
from 12-4 years old to pistols.

47
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:34,299
Only to blame his willful endorsement 
on his love for Israel.

48
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:38,472
But this is what conservatives are doing
in response to being exposed like this.

49
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:42,044
Blaming Cohen’s methods in
order to deflect from the terrifying

50
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:46,218
reality that Republicans know no 
boundaries when it comes to protecting the

51
00:02:46,218 --> 00:02:47,887
toxic gun culture in this country.

52
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:50,324
These people make decisions
in this country.

53
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:51,125
These people.

54
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:55,666
"Well how about the magical uzicorn. 
Well this is one for the girls its a lovely

55
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,836
little unicorn that you can play with."

56
00:02:57,836 --> 00:03:00,039
Nobody forced them to say these things.

57
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:04,480
Cohen did nothing but shine a magnificent
light on the GOP’s mentality and how

58
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,352
they’d rather see toddlers with
AR-15’s than discuss reasonable

59
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:11,424
gun control measures, because in
doing that it may poke a hole in

60
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,825
their NRA-filled pockets.

61
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:16,398
So to conclude, if you are more
concerned with Sarah Palin, the

62
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:19,570
person who claimed her proximity
to Russia meant she could keep a

63
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,575
closer eye on Putin, being
duped, than with the fact that

64
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:24,878
countless decision-makers in
this country were happy to

65
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:27,683
endorse arming toddlers, then
you are quite clearly are part

66
00:03:27,683 --> 00:00:00,000
of the problem, and need to take
a long hard look in the mirror.
