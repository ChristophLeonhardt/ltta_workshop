1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,589
so today's challenge is to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font>

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,240
looking really nice and then go and do

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,440
kind of the normal things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,450
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Haley has this dress as well this one</font>

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">is very fancy but it's also very nice i</font>

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,139
wore this to the harry potter premiere

7
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,219
when i was on the carpet<font color="#E5E5E5"> this summer</font>

8
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,139
think it's gonna have to be the max Kurt

9
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,289
nice maxi skirt which I love you know I

10
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:17,970
life outside for cache locations

11
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,619
occasionally but on this campus everyone

12
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,300
dresses really really casually course as

13
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,650
always like the one or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two people who</font>

14
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really dressed up in every was like</font>

15
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,769
oh I wish I had the time will the effort

16
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but that's really what</font>

17
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,619
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spend my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time doing other things</font>

18
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,359
and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing there's absolutely</font>

19
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,040
nothing wrong with spending your time on

20
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,500
beauty stuff I love watching like the

21
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,329
beauty department star videos i enjoyed

22
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:37,770
liked when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm reading magazines to read</font>

23
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,420
the case or like tutorials and<font color="#CCCCCC"> star</font>

24
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,860
guides and love how people put things

25
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,140
together i earn this so I kind of care

26
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,760
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> style a little bit but Katie made</font>

27
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,020
a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> walk about her style</font>

28
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,270
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> next obviously has her new style</font>

29
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,370
channel and so I thought I just can't

30
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">repair it really briefly here but</font>

31
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,360
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> my principle is I know is that</font>

32
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you watch dude if I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it</font>

33
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,140
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> great but I didn't have time it's</font>

34
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,550
also economical cuz i also use this

35
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,379
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> Max Factor foundation think</font>

36
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,879
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one I found that is the</font>

37
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,920
right shade of pale<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me and it only</font>

38
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,659
works in winter because in summer when i

39
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:07,530
get to turn to have to use a different

40
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">one so that's annoying so if i use a</font>

41
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,500
foundation brush with this which is what

42
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're supposed to you're supposed to</font>

43
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,530
use foundation brush it absorbs all of

44
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,420
the foundation it takes up you go

45
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,710
through a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> quicker is basically</font>

46
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,909
saying even though you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a much</font>

47
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,340
even much more even much better like

48
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,960
coverage or whatever I'd like

49
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,049
practically money-wise not an option a

50
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,100
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even wear</font>

51
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,960
foundation but does some days but I'm

52
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling quite uneven you just need to</font>

54
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,500

55
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,939
of its practical decision based on money

56
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,650
or time it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take care of your</font>

57
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,090
skin and it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use high quality</font>

58
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,189
products but at the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd rather</font>

59
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">spend money on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> books or spend it on</font>

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,250
trying to pair of mayo draft you just

61
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,180
have to kind of make these decisions

62
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,220
based on like what your situation is

63
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,869
