3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,740
filming for tonight because I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> woke</font>

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,290
up for like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two hour nap that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I took</font>

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,840
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fell asleep at seven that's what</font>

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,240
kind of week I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been having so earlier</font>

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,920
this week I was talking a little bit

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,289
about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite ways to take</font>

9
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">care of the environment and I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking about how that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole part of me</font>

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that love for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the environment and</font>

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,640
being outside and being in nature and

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,700
being away from all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the distractions</font>

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,219
of everyday life is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> at odds with</font>

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,370
my other greatest<font color="#E5E5E5"> love which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet I can't tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you how many books</font>

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,340
have been on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my list to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read forever but</font>

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,250
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started because why book</font>

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,320
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can tumblr and how many</font>

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,870
beautiful days outside I have wasted

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,800
away sitting in my bed on my computer

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,140
doing nothing and part of me really

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,600
wants to live simple life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go off the</font>

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,120
grid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just disappear from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> online</font>

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,369
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> another part of me knows that</font>

26
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,619
connecting with other people online is

27
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,270
one of the best thing that's ever

28
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,890
happened to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and beyond just</font>

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,560
entertainment the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet makes me more</font>

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,020
creative and more connected and happier

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,090
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know quite how to</font>

32
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,880
reconcile it too I senior college I had

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,590
this winter break but I thought would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

34
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect time to take a week entirely</font>

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,960
off the computer and of course I made it

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,020
like maximum of 24 hours you know it's

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,000
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a balance and to step away</font>

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,470
from kind of the endless unproductive

39
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,060
cycle of Facebook Twitter Tumblr

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,869
Facebook Twitter Tumblr email Facebook

41
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,270
Twitter Tumblr but when i'm using my

42
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,360
Wi-Fi for good and not evil for example

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,120
awesome

44
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,490
it's like Vita I don't regret<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

45
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,920
constant connection for one second but

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,810
I'm thinking perhaps that one this month

47
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,530
is over I'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to step back again and</font>

48
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,810
reevaluate and rebalance my connection

49
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,810
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the online world baby I'll go a whole</font>

50
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,480
weekend away from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

51
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,729
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it guys and maybe that'll give</font>

52
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,560
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> time after I've accomplished this</font>

53
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,560
challenge to refresh and recharge

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,440
creatively and come back and make more

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,750

56
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,150

whether it's personally socially

58
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,210
creatively have you ever tried or

59
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,520
