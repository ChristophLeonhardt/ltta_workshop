00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:04,799
hey guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's miles blow through 76 here</font>

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,890
and a bit different today because I've

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,260
put the<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera off my laptop and down to</font>

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,300
where the keyboard is and I'm sitting on

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">my bed I guess blogging is really about</font>

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,789
what's been happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life</font>

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,600
lately and you know time to reflect I've

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,279
talked about this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past why people</font>

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,010
do it because there's no going back once

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,869
you put your<font color="#CCCCCC"> video it's out there and</font>

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,279
you've got no one interrupting you or

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,130
given you you can't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vibes of</font>

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,390
people what they make of what you've

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,480
said so far until you've put it up there

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,260
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess there's no going back love</font>

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,290
internet relationships very interesting

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,180
thing and it's just saying I'm going

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,219
through at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one's</font>

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,510
coming to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an end I could explain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,719
background of it i did a video on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">live video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't put it here actually</font>

22
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,239
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment I met this person just</font>

23
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,960
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I never thought would ever go</font>

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,030
for a guy like me really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it felt that</font>

25
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as all that perspective than that</font>

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,200
and she was awesome and we got chatting

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,750
and within two<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks we just got on so</font>

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,830
well and she makes that she meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

29
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,090
world to me and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> means a lot to me</font>

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">still but</font>

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,659
it's like I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> 23 weeks in we tried</font>

32
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,210
and we had all plans because the way I

33
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,539
see is<font color="#E5E5E5"> although we haven't met yet you</font>

34
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,880
still got a plan of what would be likely

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,619
to happen in the future because if

36
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:43,819
you're planning on meeting up and

37
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:46,310
planning on maybe starting some sort of

38
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,439
relationship then you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>

39
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,640
into the future because if they're

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,259
saying in the future that might stop you

41
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:53,119
there's no point even starting it if

42
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,240
that makes sense and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,479
obviously focus on who she is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

44
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,520
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> are I've I make the decision</font>

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,090
to expose myself on here but I you know

46
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,579
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> her</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> choose separate so I'm</font>

47
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:11,620
gonna give<font color="#E5E5E5"> any think too personal and</font>

48
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,670
but there were issues I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was</font>

49
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,140
from California so I have to go out

50
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,920
there she has two children which shots a

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,230
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who I spoke to but you</font>

52
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,910
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me saying like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

53
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,579
completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's a completely put me</font>

54
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,109
off it's not ideal right now in my life

55
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,389
on you know university i'm studying in

56
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:35,299
that but you spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and you know</font>

57
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:37,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">i believe if you one side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work out</font>

58
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,500
you can and there was a plan we had in

59
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,440
which if things did go good we would

60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,120
work our exception you know that woulda

61
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,310
been cool which would have put too much

62
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,290
pressure on me but um it all<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes down</font>

63
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,269
to if it works out because as much as

64
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,459
you like some as much you click the song

65
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the internet the reality of it is</font>

66
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,180
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not until you finally meet up does</font>

67
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,069
internet relationships work<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess is</font>

68
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:06,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the issue and i believe they do but</font>

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,989
there's a big difficulty which i found

70
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,239
on many occasions in the past and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

71
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,919
thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was gonna be all right this</font>

72
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:17,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">time and she's gonna be watching this</font>

73
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,340
and I spoke to an email<font color="#CCCCCC"> so she knows</font>

74
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,079
mostly about how i feel about this by

75
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,790
guessing on this sort front might be a

76
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,340
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> different for her and we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

77
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:32,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">chat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it hopefully and soon but</font>

78
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,690
between a moment of meeting online and

79
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,880
actually meeting up you are there's no

80
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,930
physical aspects of a relationship

81
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,600
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not meeting up you're not there</font>

82
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,860
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing stuff together you just</font>

83
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,350
talking through text or video chat but

84
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,030
you're in two separate worlds and you're

85
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,760
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming as one and you know even</font>

86
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical side hugs and kisses all that</font>

87
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,010
sources it's not there and a

88
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,470
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs a physical side as</font>

89
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,300
well as a mental so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a</font>

90
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,269
chatting about stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and although it's</font>

91
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:05,709
been it was like a month or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two months</font>

92
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,739
it gets hard and what I said was we had

93
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,420
so much energy going between us at first

94
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,370
for the first two weeks and I said if we

95
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,580
keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this rate the fact there's</font>

96
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,108
no physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> sight is going to catch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

97
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,850
very quickly and things are just not

98
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,649
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work out so I said let's take</font>

99
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">step back let's try abuse often until we</font>

100
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,040
meet up which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort did and there was</font>

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">one time where a child with her by was</font>

102
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,790
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tight i don't really busy weekend</font>

103
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,990
and I was really quite and enough much

104
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,940
society because before I had so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much to</font>

105
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,770
say she found a bit weird a lot can find

106
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,660
people a lot people say why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

107
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,070
smile miles or why do you look so

108
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,450
stressed when in fact it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just me just</font>

109
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,770
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about stuff reflecting but</font>

110
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,570
because people used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be smelled so</font>

111
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,130
when they find it a bit weird so yeah

112
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:56,560
and I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from her I call her I'm</font>

113
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,419
a her I on myspace on a proper email

114
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,430
made no real responses and recently she

115
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,550
said it was because she's paranoid of

116
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,800
she thinks I found someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else and she</font>

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,210
thinks that I've lost interest she

118
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,289
thinks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> um was it that it's not the</font>

119
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:19,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">work out well we're not going to find</font>

120
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">out until we meet it's so complicated</font>

121
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,800
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact is her paranoia has</font>

122
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,450
actually led to certain things occurring

123
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll get some in a minute and it's</font>

124
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,710
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> because her paranoia has led</font>

125
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,260
to her making the situation worse

126
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,300
because i said to her i was always

127
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,680
catching up on it i was always trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

128
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">make that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and she</font>

129
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,160
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> about me but I'd argue when she</font>

130
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,240
said she'd be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line at certain</font>

131
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,650
time I'd always be there even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

132
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,420
resulted in<font color="#E5E5E5"> me working for five in the</font>

133
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,620
link now she never wanted me to

134
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,810
sacrifice my schedule anything to for

135
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,580
her but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how I fell it was because</font>

136
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in love the time she</font>

137
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">would just log off and then come back</font>

138
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">and over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time and go oh yes sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

139
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,970
that and you know she's busy she was

140
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,890
there anything that's cool but the point

141
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">is I their full felt like I was putting</font>

142
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,670
more effort than she was that was from

143
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,020
my perspective a case all about

144
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,570
perspectives but if she had such a

145
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,940
concern and she really cared about us

146
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,590
working out I thought she would<font color="#CCCCCC"> emailed</font>

147
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,210
me about it or something as opposed to

148
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,920
getting quiet and she<font color="#CCCCCC"> said she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

149
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to get hurt the previous</font>

150
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,650
relationships and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it's a big</font>

151
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,590
thing for girls anyway but I don't know

152
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,510
I'm just not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would do</font>

153
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,150
you know st. i don't know i don't might

154
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:37,060
people but i try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contact over the</font>

155
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,560
past few months because things do change

156
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,210
and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell us stuff</font>

157
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,860
but I just haven't had a chance here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

158
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,330
I guess this is one way of doing it but

159
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,780
I will be chatting to her personally so

160
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,520
yeah it's difficult yeah internet

161
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,660
relationships different to normal

162
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,640
relationships because you haven't met

163
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,440
yet into wall until you finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet and</font>

164
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,760
there's distance is usually a big

165
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,200
problem it allowed to connect people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

166
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,650
are more alike which is also but I just

167
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,020
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big issue like</font>

168
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,480
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I don't want to be hurt you</font>

169
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,640
know it works both ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I feel that</font>

170
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,560
if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being communicated to then I</font>

171
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,410
question what's happening with her and

172
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,400
that the other day is going to be best

173
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,080
for both her so she's not comfortable

174
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,030
situation which so it seems that maybe

175
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,670
it's not to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know but no</font>

176
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,020
matter what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens we'll always be</font>

177
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,550
friends and that's the attitude we're

178
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,080
going to do when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet but we're</font>

179
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,080
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> for more and if I go to</font>

180
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,200
California and this summer I've got I've

181
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,240
got money for a ticket to America for my

182
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">20th and it's going to be for California</font>

183
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,020
hopefully but an issue with the internet

184
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,280
is so I'm going to bring in some people

185
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,070
may think I'm scum for this so it's

186
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting hotter</font>

187
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:50,009
another reason internet relationships

188
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,680
are different is because you are friends

189
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,880
you're nothing you're nothing more

190
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,460
unless like special happens because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

191
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,259
may meet up in am I not click you can't

192
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,810
help from just ego I'm saying because I

193
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,280
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if people were completely</font>

194
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,169
exposed and you find the true them when

195
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:12,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're around them twenty-four seven and</font>

196
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,560
when I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contact when I get</font>

197
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,610
nothing I feel shit you know and I look

198
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,580
elsewhere and like thinking what's going

199
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,580
wrong all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of stuff and a thing</font>

200
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,169
you do is you always get contacts why

201
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,000
other people like other girls<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that</font>

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,200
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I chats other girls and</font>

203
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,640
they chat to me about my stuff and I

204
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,649
talked about it and they're saying well

205
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:41,969
maybe it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work and I'm</font>

206
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,779
just not sure and that other girls I get

207
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,670
on really well with on a friend level

208
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,709
but then when you compare it to this

209
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,200
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be seen as exactly the</font>

210
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,700
same because we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> met anyone gone</font>

211
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,240
out yet and I wonder is this what I

212
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,940
really want and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> war he wanted but</font>

213
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,500
stuff changes and

214
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,379
you know when you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think in life you</font>

215
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:26,429
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> found it you've finally found</font>

216
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:29,399
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person it's exactly what it's like</font>

217
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,670
and it's quite crushing when it when it

218
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,299
doesn't happen I guess you have

219
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:39,029
expectations but until you you know the

220
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:40,649
Internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a fantasy world</font>

221
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:44,160
or it's a nice polish on stuff that

222
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,540
isn't there i'm not saying she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

223
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,220
nice person she's great and we are no

224
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,720
we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be friends but maybe it won't be</font>

225
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">more and</font>

226
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:03,459
I don't know on the internet you can

227
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,829
chat with more than one person<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe and</font>

228
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:08,019
it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be called keeping your options</font>

229
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:10,629
open now by when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

230
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:12,850
be seen as that was all the look you

231
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,709
know all along I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to her and</font>

232
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:15,970
those i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was at same time that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not how</font>

233
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,129
it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was just chatting to her and</font>

234
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:19,720
that was it she was all on my mind and

235
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,459
other girls who are interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> I told</font>

236
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:24,759
him sorry it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not happening and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> told</font>

237
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">her about it but when stuffs lips and</font>

238
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:29,739
you're not getting contacted by you

239
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:31,449
might if this is a thing it's about

240
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:33,639
conscious and subconscious and it's not

241
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,189
me making excuses if your mind loses

242
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:38,230
interest you can't help that and I'm

243
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,779
slowly losing interest because i'm not

244
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:42,129
getting communication there's no

245
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:44,049
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> regain responded</font>

246
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:46,179
by I mean I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to chat over soon</font>

247
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,869
but if she'd already brought these

248
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:51,459
issues before and I explained to her

249
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:52,629
that everything was<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I find</font>

250
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:54,369
her and then she never<font color="#E5E5E5"> contacted me</font>

251
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:56,949
again I tried contacts and she just she

252
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">was busy or anything but she wasn't</font>

253
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,059
contact to me you know where was that it

254
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:03,519
can't be one way so maybe she's afraid

255
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">of telling me that she doesn't think</font>

256
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,999
it's going to work I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

257
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,050
but as I've said before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've said</font>

258
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,880
this to so many people in line and I'm

259
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,670
not afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say this twins well I'm 20</font>

260
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,300
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty plus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years now I have been</font>

261
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,340
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's no stupid</font>

262
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,660
relationships and nothing I've been

263
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,540
single the entire time and it's because

264
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,140
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure I find the right</font>

265
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,600
person some people are able to go into

266
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,690
relationships and with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they say</font>

267
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,310
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I'm getting bored when in fact</font>

268
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,420
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because they want to shag</font>

269
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,780
someone else for example well you know

270
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,640
people going with a relationship they

271
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,930
don't tell each other cuz they're not

272
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that honest i donate some time but then</font>

273
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,770
you know after<font color="#E5E5E5"> year or two then they</font>

274
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,930
move on to someone else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't do</font>

275
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm with someone it it's a</font>

276
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-term commitment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's the way</font>

277
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,610
it has to be for me because I can you

278
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,560
are I don't understand getting a

279
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,480
relationship that you don't expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

280
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,380
last long because is that I don't

281
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,820
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can foresee a cut-off</font>

282
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,010
point in a relationship and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how</font>

283
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,390
I felt since I was very young and I've

284
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">brought so many blogs before it's why I</font>

285
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,500
think girls<font color="#CCCCCC"> were interested in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the past</font>

286
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,810
when I was young young team because I

287
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,010
was up to st. serious when they weren't

288
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,120
you know they love get going for the

289
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,620
players who cheat on them all this sort

290
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:35,740
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> shit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm back at square one again</font>

291
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:44,480
almost said oh yeah kids from it was

292
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">something I thought was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

293
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,960
out so well but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so much now</font>

294
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,210
and it's tough you know I know I have so

295
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,230
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give to whoever I meet so much</font>

296
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,600
and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know people who said have</font>

297
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,130
trust issues people talk about the guys

298
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,780
have been chilling in the past I'm not

299
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,260
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> tall but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you precinct</font>

300
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,560
unless you go into it and for some

301
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,130
reasons I'm not given that chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

302
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,270
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like this it's a shame</font>

303
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,710
because if you look at this video<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

304
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually put it in the</font>

305
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,050
description box there that I'm in love

306
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,030
video you look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see how</font>

307
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,240
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about her there are lyrics in</font>

308
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,960
a song

309
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,360
and I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got for my band which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote</font>

310
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,670
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> her it's about hope it's about</font>

311
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,550
progression it's about you know seeing

312
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,050
for it three things because it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be all</font>

313
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,210
right in the end and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening</font>

314
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,280
because it takes two people and if two

315
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,750
people are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a commitment on</font>

316
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,550
a basis which is just communicating

317
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,440
housing and happen in real life<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

318
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,820
might be easy because you are next to

319
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,920
each other but if you're that serious

320
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,070
about someone you're gonna go for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

321
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've set up in willing to go for it but</font>

322
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,550
it's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> one way and I don't know</font>

323
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,490
really tough and lets<font color="#E5E5E5"> us alone back at</font>

324
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,940
stage one

325
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,290
and as I said I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been offered a lot of</font>

326
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,120
had gills show interest in the past but

327
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,950
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not</font>

328
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,790
exactly what I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and does</font>

329
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your bad much means that i'm</font>

330
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,570
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go into relationship i'm</font>

331
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,920
not comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the day</font>

332
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,209
that I'd waste their time it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

333
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:25,560
waste<font color="#E5E5E5"> my time and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's no point giving</font>

334
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,140
false hope you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the song made for</font>

335
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess and it's just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

336
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:34,649
take a bit longer for me to find that

337
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,560
person I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a feeling it was</font>

338
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,260
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sewn in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the States but he</font>

339
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,850
knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've Chad wait so long and</font>

340
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,560
hopefully if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see this melody you'll</font>

341
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,720
respect my honesty and understand the

342
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,519
reason I've done I've look like this is

343
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,860
so other people can reflect their faults

344
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,230
or maybe their own lives they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can give</font>

345
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,540
advice on this I think I pretty much

346
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,260
know the situation and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

347
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely honest about this</font>

348
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:08,820
and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> chat and we need to sort</font>

349
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,760
this out for good because even you know

350
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,680
all i care about is we're at least

351
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,390
friends and if we're more that's great

352
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,970
but look on the past do you really can

353
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,899
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no I denied</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why is a</font>

354
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:29,250
good listener hate is bad times but I've

355
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,510
got money for a plane ticket to<font color="#E5E5E5"> America</font>

356
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,579
so I guess the question is is it going

357
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:37,279
to California whatever options are there

358
00:15:37,279 --> 00:00:00,000
see you later people
