MATT: U.S. STOCKS CLOSING LOWER,
DRAGGED DOWN BY APPLE.
JOE: "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"
MATT: U.S. STOCKS RETREAT FROM
RECORD HIGHS.
TODAY'S MARKET ACTION, ASSET
CLASS BY CLASS.
JOE: APPLE ORDERED TO PAY $14.5
BILLION AFTER THE EUROPEAN
COMMISSION SAID IRELAND
ILLEGALLY/THE COMPANY'S TAX
BILL.
>> LAWMAKERS ON BOTH SIDES OF
THE AISLE, WE SPEAK TO GOLDMAN
SACHS ABOUT WHAT IS NEXT FOR THE
COUNTRY IN THE MARKET.
MATT: LET'S KICK IT OFF WITH
MARKET MINUTES.
STOCKS DOWN ACROSS THE BOARD,
BUT SOME INDIVIDUAL MOVERS, ONE
BEING APPLE.
DOWN THREE QUARTERS OF 1%.
POTASH NOT AS BIG, 14 BILLION
DOLLAR COMPANY, WILL ENTER INTO
A MERGER OF EQUALS.
HERSHEY'S DOWN BY THE SAME
AMOUNT THAT POTASH IS UP.
JOE: THE GOVERNMENT BOND MARKETS
QUIET.
VIRTUALLY NOTHING GOING ON.
SHORT-TERM RATES DOWN.
LONG-TERM RATES UP.
THERE IS SOME STEEPENING, THAT'S
WHY THE FINANCIALS RALLY.
>> SOME ACTION IN THE FX
MARKETS.
DOLLAR GAINING FOR A FIFTH DAY
OF AGAINST THE YEN, THE LONGEST
WINNING STREAK SINCE MARCH.
THIS IS ON SPECULATION WE WILL
GET A RATE HIKE FROM THE FED
THIS YEAR.
I AM ALSO KEEPING AN EYE ON THE
BRAZILIAN CURRENCY, THE
BEST-PERFORMING AGAINST THE
DOLLAR THIS YEAR.
INTRADAY, A LITTLE LOWER,
SPECULATION THAT BANKS ARE
SEEKING TO WEAKEN IT BE FOR THE
CENTRAL BANK'S DETERMINE A KEY
RATE IN SETTLING CONTRACTS.
THE OPTIMISM ABOUT A NEW
GOVERNMENT PULLING THE COUNTRY
OUT OF A RECESSION AS THE
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL HEADS TO THE
FINAL STAGES.
JOE: ON THE COMMODITIES FRONT,
LET'S LOOK AT AN INTRADAY CHART
OF OIL.
A GOT SLAMMED EARLY THIS
MORNING, ANXIETIES ABOUT WHETHER
WE WILL SEE SUPPLY BUILDUP.
WE'VE SEEN OIL IN THIS REGION
FOR A WHILE.
ONE MORE COMMODITY TO KEEP YOUR
EYE ON IS GOLD, WHICH HAD A
GREAT START TO THE YEAR.
THIS CHART POINTING OUT THAT
GOLD IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TWO
MONTH TRADING RANGE.
IF IT CONTINUES TO TUMBLE, KEEP
AN EYE ON THAT.
MATT: ALL THE COMMODITIES ON MY
MAIN PAGE WERE DOWN, EXCEPT FOR
COFFEE.
LET'S TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO THE
TERMINAL.
WE WILL SHOW YOU THE FUNCTIONS
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN TO
ACCESS THESE CHARTS.
I'M LOOKING AT A FUNCTION THAT I
HOPE WILL GET BIGGER FOR
BLOOMBERG CLIENTS.
THIS ALLOWS YOU TO BE
COMPETITIVE, NOT ONLY WITH YOUR
COLLEAGUES AT YOUR OWN COMPANY,
BUT WITH COLLEAGUES AT OTHER
COMPANIES AND PLACE BETS ON
VARIOUS THINGS.
THERE'S A DROP-DOWN MENU AND YOU
CAN PICK FROM ANY NUMBER OF DATA
POINTS THAT COME OUT.
JOE, YOU WILL WANT TO FOCUS ON
INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS, BUT
NONFARM PAYROLLS IS A BIG ONE
COMING OUT ON FRIDAY.
WE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR THIS
ALREADY, 180,000 IS THE SURVEY.
THE LAST TIME WE BLEW OUT AND
BEAT AT 225,000.
JOE: SPEAKING OF THE JOBS
REPORT, A LITTLE PREVIEW THAT
MIGHT BE RELEVANT WITH TODAY'S
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE INDEX.
CHECK OUT THIS CHART COMPARING
THE LABOR DIFFERENTIAL AND X
VERSUS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.
-- DIFFERENTIAL INDEX VERSUS THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RIGHT.
THEY SAY DO YOU PERCEIVE JOBS AS
HARD OR EASY TO GET RIGHT NOW?
THE LOWER IT GOES THAT IS THE
MORE THEY THINK JOBS ARE EASIER
TO GET.
WE HAVE JUST THAT THE BEST LEVEL
SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.
PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF THE LABOR
MARKET CONTINUES TO GET BETTER.
YOU CAN SEE HOW NICELY DIRECTION
HE TRACKS WITH THE U.S.
EMPLOYMENT RATE, SO WE WILL SEE
IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE A DECLINE
IN THE U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AS
THAT MEASURE OF LABOR MARKET
HEALTH FROM THE SURVEY.
MATT: VERY COAL INDEX.
>> MY CHART STICKS WITH THE
MACRO SEEN, BUT LOOKING AT
CYCLICALS VERSUS DEFENSIVE.
I WANTED TO LOOK AT IT GLOBALLY.
HERE I HAVE THE FTSE CYCLICAL
INDEX AND WHITE AND THE FTSE
DEFENSIVE INDEX.
CYCLICAL SHARES ARE
OUTPERFORMING DEFENSIVE FOR A
SECOND STRAIGHT MONTH.
GLOBAL ECONOMIC DATA HAS BEATEN
FORECASTS SINCE JULY, BUT STILL
THE WORLD SHOWING THE SLOWEST
GROWTH RATE IN SEVEN YEARS, BUT
STILL SEEING THIS ROTATION
GLOBALLY.
THESE INDEX HAVE MEMBERS FROM
JAPAN, KOREA, SWITZERLAND.
IT IS REALLY LOOKING GLOBAL
HERE.
SINCE THE END OF JUNE, THE
CYCLICAL INDEX HAS JUMPED 9.5%,
WHERE AS THE DEFENSIVE ONE HAS
DROPPED TO 0.7%, SO THAT REALLY
TELLS THE STORY.
MATT: THESE GUYS ARE BEATING
THIS ROTATION THING TO DEATH.
JOE: OLIVER RENICK IS ONSET.
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THIS
SHIFT.
THAT'S SO OLD NEWS.
WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING?
DO PEOPLE SEE THIS TREND IS
HAVING ROOM TO RUN?
OLIVER: PERHAPS.
IT DEPENDS ON WHY YOU THINK IT
IS HAPPENING TO BEGIN WITH.
THIS ONE IS POTENTIALLY
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF
THE FEW AREAS OF THE MARKET THAT
HAS SURVIVED, WEAKER THE PAST
MONTH, BUT THROUGH THE FIRST SIX
MONTHS, IT WAS THE ONLY PART OF
THE STOCK MARKET GETTING HIGHER
LEVELS AND HIGHER VALUATIONS, SO
IF YOU THINK THIS IS A RESULT OF
SPECULATION INTEREST RATES WILL
MOVE HIGHER AND DIVIDEND PAYING
COMPANIES WILL NOT BE THE HOT
COMMODITY TO GO AFTER, THEN THAT
COULD BE ONE EXPLANATION, BUT IF
YOU LOOK AT THE BOND MARKETS, IT
IS VERY INTERESTING, 30 YEAR
SWAPS, NOW BELOW TREASURIES, SO
YOU BASICALLY HAVE A MARKET THAT
INDICATES EXPECTATIONS OF LOWER
RATES IN THE LONGER TERM
DURATION BONDS.
IF THAT IS THE CASE, THAT MUST
NOT BE AN INTEREST RATE FEW ON
WHAT IS HAPPENING AND DIVIDEND
SOCKS.
EITHER THE MARKETS ARE WRONG, OR
THESE TYPES OF COMPANIES ARE
DOING LESS WELL BECAUSE OF SOME
OTHER REASON.
MAYBE IT IS A VALUATION STORY, A
SECTOR ROTATION, CORPORATE
EARNINGS.
MATT: YOU COULD SEE, IF YOU'RE
GOING TO UTILITIES BECAUSE YOU
LIKE THE DIVIDENDS THEY ARE
PAYING, BUT EARNINGS MISSED THE
STREETS EXPECTATIONS BY 30% LAST
QUARTER, MAYBE THEY WILL HAVE TO
CUT THOSE DIVIDENDS.
PAYOUTS FROM TELECOMS, STAPLES,
AND UTILITIES, ALL THESE
DEFENSIVE SECTORS, BUT IT THEY
DON'T EARN MONEY, THEY CAN'T
CONTINUE TO PAY YOU THIS UNLESS
THEY BORROW.
THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE
CONCERNS.
OLIVER: THIS COMES INTO A LARGER
PICTURE IN THE EQUITY MARKET,
WHICH IS HIGH PAYOUT RATIOS,
PROFITS WEAKENING, BUT DIVIDENDS
HAVE NOT BEEN CUT.
WE ARE SEEING SOME OF THAT IN
MORE DISTRESSED AREAS, BUT WHICH
SECTORS ARE THE ONES THAT WILL
HAVE TO CUT DIVIDENDS IF THEY
NEED TO.
THERE ARE DIFFERENT METRICS YOU
CAN LOOK AT SHOWING COMPANY
STRETCHED IN TERMS OF THEIR CASH
LEVELS AND MOVING DOWN THE PAST
COUPLE OF QUARTERS, DEBT LEVELS
GETTING HIGH, THE FIRST THING TO
GO IS NOT THE DIVIDEND, BUT
THESE OTHER SHAREHOLDER
ACTIVITIES, BUYBACKS, ETC., THAT
HAVE STRETCH THE COMPANY THIN.
IF WE DON'T SEE THAT QUICK
TURNAROUND AND EARNINGS, WHICH
KEEPS GETTING PUSHED UP QUARTER
AND QUARTER, GUESS WHAT?
NOW IT'S NEGATIVE EARNINGS.
THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT, TO FOCUS
ON WHETHER THEY CAN KEEP UP TO
BEGIN WITH.
>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
MULTIPLES.
WE HAVE DO HAVE A CHART TO SHOW
THEM ELEVATED HISTORICALLY AND
ALMOST ACROSS ALL METRICS.
THEY REMAIN BELOW THE REST OF
THE DEVELOPED WORLD.
I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE TELL ME
THAT EUROPE IS ATTRACTIVE VERSUS
THE U.S., JAPAN IS ATTRACTIVE,
BUT ARE USING SOMETHING
DIFFERENT?
OLIVER: THIS IS AN INTERESTING
THING, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE S&P,
NO MATTER WHAT METRIC, YOU WILL
FIND THE MARKET IS EITHER HIGHLY
VALUED RELATIVE TO HISTORY OR IN
ONE OF THE TOP PERCENTILES.
THEY WILL SHOW AN OVERVALUED
STOCK MARKET, BUT YOU HAVE TO
REMEMBER THERE IS A LOGICAL
EXPLANATION FOR WHY VALUATIONS
ARE HIGH.
THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS SORT OF
THE BEST HOUSE ON THE BLOCK.
THERE IS A MATHEMATICAL
CONSIDERATION YOU HAVE TO TAKE
INTO ACCOUNT.
IF YOU LOOK AT TE, THEY HAVE NOT
BEEN GREAT, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT
EUROPE, THEY HAVE GOTTEN
DEMOLISHED.
IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE WORLD,
THE DENOMINATOR KEEPS GETTING
LOWER AND LOWER AND THOSE
VALUATIONS ARE VERY HIGH.
THE FTSE IS TRADING 50 TIMES.
IF YOU LOOK AT MARKET RELATIVE
VIBRATION COME THE S&P TRADING
AT 20-22 TIMES, LOWER THAN ITS
PEERS IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD.
SO IT IS INTERESTING TO TRY TO
FIGURE OUT WHETHER VALUATIONS IN
THE U.S. ARE HIGH BASED ON OUR
OWN HISTORY, BUT AROUND THE
WORLD, THEY COULD BE ATTRACTIVE.
JOE: THIS CHART I HAVE BEEN
STARING AT THE LAST THREE DAYS,
THE SP Y ETF -- SPY ETF.
IT IS REMARKABLE HOW BONDS AND
STOCKS ARE MOVING AND LOCKSTEP
RIGHT NOW.
IN THE BROADER SCHEME OF THINGS,
THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY
DIVERSITY WITHIN ASSET CLASSES.
OLIVER: RIGHT, IF YOU ARE A
PORTFOLIO MANAGER, THEN YOU
DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR MONEY IN
CASH.
IT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING,
SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHERE
YOU ARE GOING TO PUT IT HERE AND
IF YOU WANT TO GO INTO A RISKIER
PLAY, THEN MAYBE A EMERGING
MARKETS.
YOU WANT TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE
YOU GET SOME KIND OF RETURN,
THEN GO TO THE U.S.
THAT PUSHES STOCKS UP, BOND
YIELDS DOWN, BUT WHETHER THE
CORRELATION CAN STAY IN TACT
WILL BE A BIG DEAL.
JOE: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MATT: UP NEXT, A DEEPER LOOK
INTO MARKET TRENDS.

"WHAT'D YOU MISS?"
WHY A BY THE DIP STRATEGY MAY
NOT BE A SIMPLE SOLUTION FOR
RECENT VOLATILITY.
>> YOU HAVE SEEN THE VIX CREEP
UP, BACK AROUND 13, A SUPPORT
LEVEL.
IT DID BELOW, AND NOW BACK UP.
AS YOU HEAD INTO SEASONALITY IN
SEPTEMBER, BREXIT, YOU HAVE A
CHANCE TO SEE VIX SPIKE UP, BOND
YIELDS CREEP UP GLOBALLY, AND
THESE BOND PROXY STOCKS,
UTILITIES, DIVIDEND STOCKS,
SMALL OUTFLOWS, UNDERPERFORMING,
AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT
HAVE SUPPORTED THE EQUITY MARKET
ARE NOT THERE.
>> THAT IS LIKE THE THEME OF THE
WEEK FOR US HERE.
>> THE DEATH OF THE SAFETY
STOCKS.
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
IT COULDN'T IT BE THAT THE
ECONOMY IS IMPROVING AND THINKS
OF BETTER SO WE NO LONGER NEED
TO HIDE?
>> THERE IS SOME RELEVANT --
ELEMENT TO THAT.
YOU ARE SEEING A RUSH INTO BETA,
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE CHOSE THIS
AS THE LAST BASTION IN THE
EQUITY MARKET.
THEY DID NOT WANT TO OWN
EQUITIES, BUT NOT THE DIVIDEND
STOCKS.
AS YIELDS GO HIGHER AND THEY GET
NERVOUS, I THINK THEY WILL WANT
TO GO OUT OF THAT.
I THINK THE NEXT EXODUS IS OUT
OF THE STOCK MARKET COMPLETELY.
IF THEY GIVE UP THAT, THEY ARE
SELLING THE EQUITY MARKETS, AND
THAT WILL CREATE PRESSURE.
>> WE TALKED ABOUT THIS HUNT FOR
YIELD, AND ONE THING YOU TALK
ABOUT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES
PRESENTED BY THE INCREASING
LIBOR.
A GREAT COLUMN ABOUT HOW THE FED
ACTUALLY HAS NOT PAID A LOT OF
ATTENTION TO THE PROSPECTS OF
THIS RISING, SO HOW ARE YOU
PLAYING THIS?
>> WE LIKE THE LEVERAGED LOAN
SPACE, THE HIGH-YIELD BOND
EQUIVALENT, SO FLOATING RATES.
YOU ARE STARTING TO CREEP ABOVE
75, AN INCREASE IN RATES,
STEPPING UP THE CAPITAL
STRUCTURE, SO I PREFERRED THAT
ELEMENT OF SAFETY.
WITHIN THAT, THERE ARE CLOSE IN
THE FUNDS, ETF'S, SO YOU HAVE
SOME UPSIDE IF YIELDS DO RISE,
AND A LOT OF PROTECTION BECAUSE
THE LIBOR MOVE IS ISOLATED.
WERE ALSO LOOKING AT FLOATING
RATE IN BONDS, CITIBANK CAME OUT
WITH A SEVEN-YEAR FLOATER.
THERE ARE CORPORATE FLOATERS,
ETF FLT, SO YOU'RE NOT GIVING UP
MUCH TO AVOID INTEREST RATE
RISK.
THAT TRADE-OFF MAKES SENSE TO
ME.

PORTFOLIOS.
I'M LOOKING AT THE DEGREE TO
WHICH EQUITIES AND TREASURIES

THERE SEEMS TO BE NO
DIVERSIFICATION.
FRIDAY WAS ONE OF THE WORST DAYS
IN A LONG TIME FOR THE
MULTI-STRATEGY INDICES THAT WAS

DOES THE STRATEGY YOU REPRESENT

>> IT WILL BEHAVE MORE
UNCORRELATED. MOVING INTO LIBOR
AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS
RISE, WHICH IS TECHNICAL AND
WONKY, BUT WILL BE MAINSTREAM
AND HIT PEOPLE IF THEY SEE THEIR
MORTGAGES GO UP, SO IT'S A GREAT
WAY TO GET YIELD AND DIVERSIFY
AWAY FROM FIXED INCOME.
MATT: WE ARE LOOKING FOR A GAIN
OF 180,000.
WE GOT A BLOWOUT NUMBER LAST

IF WE GET A BLOWOUT NUMBER THIS

SEPTEMBER?
>> I THINK THERE IS A DECENT
CHANCE TO GO EVEN IF WE GET A
DECENT NUMBER.
THE AUGUST REPORT IS TYPICALLY
DISAPPOINTING, SO IF WE, IN
LINE, THAT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH.
WHERE I DIFFER IS THAT THE FED
SPENT SO MUCH TIME PUTTING JUNE
ON THE TABLE, THEN DIDN'T RAISE.
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS COMING INTO
JUNE, WE HAD BAD DATA AFTER BAD
DATA.
IT WAS MORE THAN THAT.
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE THE
EXACT OFFICE -- OPPOSITE.
THERE ARE SIGNS OF INFLATION,
JOBS THERE, SO I WOULD NOT BE
SURPRISED TO SEE A SEPTEMBER

I HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT LOOKS
AT THE YUAN BEARS.
THIS ONE SHOWS YOU THE THREE
MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND THE
SPOT PRICE AND BLUE.
AS THE LINE GOES UP, THE YUAN
GETS WEAKER.
THREE MONTH VOLATILITY IN AUGUST
HAS CLIMBED AT A FASTER RATE
THAN ANY MONTH SINCE JANUARY.
BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU CAN SEE
TRADERS THINK THE YUAN COULD GET
WILDER.
YOU COULD LOOK AT THE FACT THAT
PUTS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN
CALLS RIGHT NOW.
THE FORWARD CONTRACTS TRADED AT
A DISCOUNT TO THE SPOT PRICE.
ALL THESE THINGS INDICATE THAT
EVERYONE EXPECTS THE YUAN TO
WEAKEN.
JOE: THERE IS A VOLATILITY
PICKUP.
THE S&P 500 OR MARKETS DON'T
RESPOND TO THE WEAKENING

LET'S TALK TO THE CHIEF
ECONOMIST AND HEAD OF LATIN
AMERICAN ECONOMIC RESEARCH I
GOLDMAN SACHS.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
AN EXTRAORDINARY RALLY ACROSS
THE BOARD, THE CURRENCY HAS HAD
A HUGE YEAR.
WHAT IS BEING PRICED DAN?
HOW MUCH IS IT ABOUT THE
IMPEACHMENT, GLOBAL MACRO
INDICATORS, ABOUT THE DOMESTIC
ECONOMY, AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO
SEE AND THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY FOR
IT TO CONTINUE?
>> EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT, A LOT
MORE SUPPORTIVE.
THE RATES IN THE CURRENCY HAVE
BEEN REFLECTING THAT.
THE FINAL IN PEACH MINT VOTE IS
EXPECTED TO CLEAR CONGRESS
TOMORROW.
THERE IS A LOT OF HOPE THAT THAT
WILL LEAD TO A BETTER POLICY
FRAMEWORK, AND ADMINISTRATION
WHERE CONDITIONS ARE STRONGER.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE
OF THE CURRENCY, UP 22%, AT NINE
PERCENTAGE POINTS IN CARY, TOTAL
RETURN OF MORE THAN 30%.
EQUITIES, 35%, 65% IN DOLLAR
TERMS.
MATT: 85% IN POUNDS.

INVESTED IN THE POLITICAL
TRANSITION.
IT LEADS US TO ANTICIPATE A
TURNING POINT.
CONFIDENCE INDICATORS HAVE
IMPROVED, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION
SHOWS THE CYCLE MAY BE ABLE TO
STABILIZE.
WE NEED THE ADMINISTRATION TO
DELIVER MORE ON THE FISCAL
FRONT.
>> WHAT ABOUT FX INTERVENTION BY
THE CENTRAL BANK? THE CURRENCY
IS WEAKER TODAY.
HOW MUCH DOES THAT PLAY INTO
THIS?
COULD THAT PUT A STOP TO THIS
RALLY?
>> THE CENTRAL BANK HAS PLAYING

I DON'T THINK IT IS A FORCEFUL
DRIVER ON DAY-TO-DAY ACTION.
MAY BE A DAY LIKE TODAY, MORE OF
AN IMPACT, BUT OVERALL THEY ARE
DISPOSED -- LESS DISPOSED TO
INTERVENE IN THE FX MARKET.
JOE: ASSUMING THE NEW
ADMINISTRATION REMAINS
PERMANENT, IT IT NEEDS TO DO
MORE ON THE FISCAL FRONT.
TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT THE
TASK AHEAD IS.
>> IT IS MONUMENTAL.
PRIMARY FISCAL DEFICIT 2% OF
GDP.
WE NEED A PRIMARY SURPLUS OF 3-3
.5% OF GDP.
THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO
GO IN INCREMENTAL STEPS.
THERE ARE TWO BILLS THAT NEED TO
BE SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS, AN
AMENDMENT TO CAP THE GROWTH OF
PRIMARY SPENDING.
THE HOPE IS THAT WILL CLEAR
CONGRESS WITH NOT TOO MANY
LOOPHOLES.
THE SECOND ONE IS A STRONG
SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM THAT
IMPROVES THE CHURCH A TREE FOR

MORE THAN THAT, WE NEED THE
GOVERNMENT TO STOP ACCOMMODATING
DEMANDS FOR ADDITIONAL SPENDING

THEORIES THAT GOVERNMENTS IN A
DEEP ALL NEED TO CUT SPENDING.

YOU CONFIDENT THAT IS THE RIGHT
PRESCRIPTION?
IT'S A CRUDE WAY OF SHOWING HOW
PAINFUL THE SITUATION IS.
>> THIS IS A REFLECTION OF THE
IMBALANCES THAT HAVING HUMAN
RELATED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.
YOU END UP WITH INFLATION AND
DOUBLE DIGITS IN 2015.
THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION THAT
EXPANDED WAY TOO MUCH.
THE FEAR THAT ON THIS PATH WE
WILL GO INTO FISCAL

MATT: APPLE IS ORDERED TO PAY
MORE THAN $14 BILLION PLUS
INTEREST IN A THREE-YEAR EU
CRACKDOWN AGAINST CORPORATE TAX
AVOIDANCE.
WE WILL BREAK DOWN THE DECISION
AND IRELAND'S REACTION.
DO THEY EVEN WANT THE MONEY?
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

>> "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS
ORDERED APPLE TO PAY MORE THAN
$14 BILLION PLUS INTEREST IN A
TAX CASE.
IT IS THE LARGEST TAX PENALTY IN
A THREE-YEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST
CORPORATE TAX AVOIDANCE.
APPLE AND IRELAND ABOUT TO FIGHT
THE DECISION.
WE ASKED IF THEY ARE STRETCHING
RULES RIGHT USING THEM TO
ENFORCE NEW TAX LAWS.
>> NOT AT ALL.
TAXATION IS A MATTER FOR MEMBER
STATES.
NO MEMBER STATES CAN GIVE OUT
SELECTIVE BENEFITS TO A COMPANY.
IT IS A LONG-STANDING PRACTICE
THAT GOES BACK TO THE 1950'S.
IN THAT RESPECT, THERE IS NO
NOVELTIES HERE.
THIS IS THE WORK WE ARE SUPPOSED
TO DO.
>> THERE IS DISAPPOINTMENT FROM
BOTH PARTIES AND THE U.S.
TREASURY.
LET ME READ TO YOU WHAT THEY
SAID.
THE TREASURY IS DISAPPOINTED
THAT THE COMMISSION IS ACTING
UNILATERALLY AND THE PARTING
FROM THE IMPORTANT PROGRESS THAT
THE U.S. COME THE EU, AND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAVE
MADE TOGETHER TO COMBAT TAX
AVOIDANCE.
WHY DID YOU FEEL THE NEED TO ACT
UNILATERALLY WHEN THE OCD HAS
MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS OVER THE
LAST THREE YEARS?
>> THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT
POINT, THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE
OVER THE LAST YEAR.
IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, NEW
LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PROPOSED
AND PASSED AND IS NOW BEING
IMPLEMENTED.
THAT IS ALL GOOD AND FINE
BECAUSE IT MAKES THE GLOBAL
TAXATION MUCH FAIRER IN THE
FUTURE AND TAXATION AS SUCH MORE
TRANSPARENT.
THE CASE HERE IS SPECIFIC.
WE HAVE A LONG-STANDING
PROHIBITION OF MEMBER STATES
HANDING OUT BENEFITS OR
ADVANTAGES TO SPECIFIC
COMPANIES.
THIS IS THE CASE HERE, MORE THAN
IT IS A CASE OF TAXATION.
THESE BENEFITS CAN COME IN THE
FORM OF A CHEAP PIECE OF LAND, A
GENEROUS LOAN, A GRANT, OR A TAX
BENEFIT, AND THAT IS THE CASE
HERE, MUCH MORE THAN IT IS A
CASE OF INTERFERING IN THE VERY
GOOD WORK DONE BY THE OECD OR
G-20.
MATT: IRELAND ALSO PLANS TO
FIGHT THE RULING.
EARLIER TODAY ON BLOOMBERG, THE
IRISH FINANCE MINISTER REJECTED
ARGUMENTS THAT APPLE IS GETTING
SPECIAL TREATMENT.
>> WE DON'T MANAGE HOW APPLE
ORGANIZES THEIR AFFAIRS.
WE TAX THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
THAT MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES
CARRY OUT IN IRELAND.
IF THERE WERE ANY RANGED IN'S
MADE BEYOND IRISH LAW AND THE
COMPETENCE OF THE IRISH TAX
AUTHORITIES AND AN ARGUMENT IS
BEING MADE THAT APPLE DOES NOT
PAY ENOUGH TAX, THEN IT IS A
MATTER FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS.
THE COMMISSIONER IN HER PRESS
STATEMENT TODAY HAS ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT.
SHE SAID SOME OF THE TAXI IS
ATTRIBUTING TO IRELAND MAY BE
DUE TO OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
AND ADVISES THEM TO LOOK FOR THE
ATTACKS.
SHE ALSO SAYS THAT IF APPLE
WANTS TO MAKE AN ALTERNATIVE
ARRANGEMENT WITH U.S.
AUTHORITIES IN TERMS OF
TRANSFERRING PROFITS TO RESEARCH
AND DEVELOP MEN COSTS, THEN THEY
SHOULD DO THAT, SO BY HER OWN
PRESS STATEMENT, SHE ADMITS THE
LIABILITY MAY NOT BE IN IRELAND
AT ALL, BUT ELSEWHERE.
>> MORE THAN 700 U.S. COMPANIES
EMPLOY 40,000 PEOPLE IN IRELAND.
WILL THIS DAMAGE INVESTMENT,
JOBS?
WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO U.S.
COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN
IRELAND TODAY?
>> FIRST OF ALL, WHEN THE
EUROPEAN COMMISSION WITH THE
ASSISTANCE OF THE IRISH
AUTHORITIES WERE RESEARCHING THE
APPLE CASE, THEY LOOKED AT
ALMOST 100 COMPANIES, AND MOST
OF THE SIGNIFICANT AMERICAN
INVESTORS IN IRELAND WERE LOOKED
AT, AND THE COMMISSION HAVE COME
TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ONLY
POSSIBLE CASE IS THE CASE THEY
ARE PROSECUTING AGAINST APPLE,
SO THERE IS NO CONTAGION EFFECT.
ALL I AM SAYING IS THAT WE DON'T
THINK THIS DECISION IS VALID AND
WE WILL APPEAL THIS DECISION AND
WE ARE SAYING THAT WE WILL STAND
BY THOSE COMPANIES THAT INVEST
IN IRELAND AND WE WILL APPLY THE
TAX REGIME APPLICABLE UNDER
IRISH LAW AND WE HAVE ASSURANCES
FROM MANY OF THEM THAT THEY WILL
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IRELAND
AND CREATE JOBS IN IRELAND.

I SHOW OFF OUR JAZZ HANDS.
FIRST, REHEARSALS FOR LESS THAN
A MONTH BEFORE DONALD TRUMP AND
HILLARY CLINTON FACE-OFF IN
THEIR FIRST DEBATE, THE RITUAL
OF GENERAL DEBATE PREP.
THE NEW YORK TIMES FOLLOWED UP
WITH A REPORT ABOUT HOW
CLINTON'S CAMP IS TAPPING
PSYCHOLOGISTS AND DONALD TRUMP'S
GHOST WRITER TO GET UNDER HIS
SKIN ON STAGE.
HAS CLINTON FOLKS RAISE
EXPECTATION, JOEL BENENSON WENT

MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP IS MORE
INTERESTED IN HIS INSTINCTS.
DONALD TRUMP OPTED FOR A MORE
STRAIGHTFORWARD DISCUSSION OF
DEBATE TOPICS TO EXPRESS HIS
CONCERN OVER OVER PREPARING.

AILES SHOWED UP WITH A BLACK

WE WILL HAVE FUN WITH DEBATE
PREP LATER IN THE SHOW.
FOR NOW, WHAT ARE THE STRATEGIC
OBJECTIVES AND CHALLENGES
FOR PREPARING FOR THE DEBATE?
DONNY: THE GREAT THING ABOUT A
CAMPAIGN AND THE PROCESS IS WE
GET TO SEE A DRESS REHEARSAL.
TRUMPET FROM THE GUT.
-- TRUMP FROM THE GUT.
HILLARY IN THE BOOKS.
HILLARY'S BIG PRO IS HER
COMPETENCY.
HER BIG CON IS SHE IS ON
TRUSTWORTHY -- ON TRUSTWORTHY.
IN THE DEBATE, HILLARY CAN PLAY
TO HER STRENGTHS.
TRUMP CAN'T PLAY THE OUTSIDER IN
A DEBATE.
HIS TEMPERAMENT CAN BE IN PLAY,
SO HIS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
PLAY TO HILLARY'S STRENGTH.
JOHN: SHE WILL PREPARE FOR THIS
DEBATE BY STUDYING, BEING THE
WONK, KNOWING THE POLICY, BUT
SHE MUST TRY TO PROVOKE HIM.
SHE CAN'T OUT WONK HIM.
SHE IS GOING TO GET UNDER HIS
SKIN.
HE NEEDS TO ALLAY THE FEARS THAT
HE IS NOT SUITED FOR THE OFFICE.
THAT IS HARDER.
BEING HIMSELF IS THE PROBLEM.
DONNY: WE KNOW AND THE
PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE SAID THAT
WHEN YOU GO AGAINST HIM AS AN
UNSUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN, NOT AS
RICH, PUT PINS IN THEM, HE
REACTS.
WE HAVE SEEN DONALD TRUMP ON
STAGE TO AN AUDIENCE GO AT
HILLARY CLINTON.
IT WILL BE A DIFFERENT THING
