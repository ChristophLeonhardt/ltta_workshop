it now appears that Robert Mueller the special investigator into Trump Russia collusion he's obtained tens of thousands of Trump transition emails now you may ask what exactly do the Trump transition emails have to do with collusion during the election cycle the answer of course is nothing but this is sort of the problem for the Mueller investigation which seems to be falling apart pretty quickly all of the crimes they are now investigating have to do the secondary crimes lying to the FBI maybe transition stuff but nothing to do with that central contention right the Trump and the Russians work together to rig the 2016 elections against Hillary Clinton this was the entire motivating factor behind the investigations in 2016 there's been the entire reasons I'm across have been so animated about it now so Special Counsel Mueller has obtained many tens of thousands of Trump transition emails including emails from Jared Kushner transition team sources told Axios Trump officials discovered Mueller had the emails when his prosecutors used them as the basis for questions to witnesses the sources said the emails included twelve accounts one of which contain about 7,000 emails the accounts include the team's political leadership and foreign policy team according to the sources apparently Mueller did this perfectly legally he went through the GSA the General Services Administration they host the transition email system and they have capacity to read all these emails the transition emails are included include sensitive exchanges on matters that include potential appointments gossip about the views of particular senators involved in the confirmation processes speculation about vulnerabilities of Trump nominees etc what does that have to do with collusion the answer is pretty much nothing and meanwhile while Mueller is going after Trump over supposed collusion that we have no evidence exists we now know that the Obama administration was colluding with Russia to help Iran so this is a story out of Politico European version a pretty amazing story reported this over at Daily wire today there's clear evidence that the Obama administration colluded with the Russian government to frame Islamic terrorists responsible for the deaths of Americans in order to appease Iran to pave the way for the Obama administration's 'iron nuclear deal there's a report from Josh Meyer of Politico then it reports that a leaf a god a Lebanese an arms dealer and quote suspected top cause bola operative whom agents believed reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin was captured by the Czechs in 2014 Fayed had been incited in the US now you would expect the Obama administration to move for him to be extradited correct nothing of the sort the Obama administration did not push for extradition instead Fayed ended up in Lebanon where he's back at his terrorist work he's particularly active in supplying weapons to the barbarous Syrian regime that's not the only thing the Obama administration did on behalf of Lebanese terrorists according to the Politico administration officials also blocked or undermined their efforts to go after other top hezbollah operatives and when project Cassandra agents and other investigators sought repeatedly to investigate and prosecute Abdullah Sofia Dean Hezbollah's longtime envoy to iran who may considered the linchpin of hezbollah as criminal network the Justice Department refused in other words the Obama administration was working with the Russian government to make sure that there was no crackdown on Hezbollah because they were afraid it would tick off the Russians we also know President Obama was offering flexibility to the Russians in the middle of the 2012 election saying that he had flexibility after the election cycle if Putin would just back off all of his concerns about missile defense for the moment all of which is to say there's a lot more evidence of actual Russian collusion among the Obama administration members than there is among the Trump administration members at this point at least with regard to elections and even with regard to policy because it turns out that even what Mike Flynn was trying to do ie get Russia to not push a resolution at the UN condemning Israel didn't work so the actual evidence of collusion is basically nil which means that Trump has the upper hand now in the investigation apparently Trump is is pretty sanguine about it there's a report out today the Trump expects Mueller to basically clear Trump himself in the very near future and that's why Trump said over the weekend he was asked are you gonna fire Mueller and here was his answer the president last night quashed Capitol Hill rumors that he was poised to fire special counsel Robert Muller what else what are you surprised okay so he's obviously angry at the press for saying then he's gonna fire Mueller as well he should be and I think that he's right when he says you know are you surprised like guys I know you want me to do it I'm not gonna do it why should he do it Mueller's investigation has already been compromised by the people who are inside of it it's already been shown to be at least in part political or at least there are those suspicions there's not evidence that he did anything so why would he fire Miller why not just wait it out there's a question I asked on Friday why not just wait this out and it appears the president has come to the same conclusion especially because it appears the president is now winning on a series of subjects tax cuts are supposed to be voted on tomorrow in the House and the Senate so we will have a tax reform bill before Christmas that tax reform bill does lower taxes for virtually everyone in the United States including corporations you may have quibbles with the way that it's structured I have quibbles with it too it is a good bill it also gets rid of the individual mandate as it currently stands that means you will not be mandated to buy your crappy Obamacare program anymore the left says well that's terrible because now people are gonna lose their health insurance well the people losing their health insurance are people who don't want to buy their health insurance according to the Congressional Budget Office so this is a big win for Trump if this happens it's sort of partial repeal of Obamacare included in the tax reform and Trump obviously is very excited there's a report out today that the last quarters growth has been revised upward to almost four percent of GDP growth which is an amazing level of growth haven't had that in years here as President Trump talking about that yesterday the economy now has hit 3% nobody thought would be anywhere close I think we can go to four or five and maybe even 6% ultimately each percentage point is two and a half trillion dollars we are back we're really going to start to rock we need this as our final push and you're going to see some numbers that are great but most importantly you're going to see great job numbers jobs are gonna come pouring back into this country which we need very much okay so there has been you know there there having good quarters before there was a good quarter in q3 of 2014 for example we've heard something like five percent but if Trump has the sustained level of growth he's gonna do just fine or at least he's gonna be in better shape and he knows it he knows it and that's why you're seeing all the Republicans come out now and say well let the investigation Ford who cares just let the investigation do what the investigation is gonna do no biggie right GOP senator Lankford from I believe is from Oklahoma he comes forward and he says yeah well there's no reason to attend this investigation at this point yeah it's very serious we will have someone inside what they've got to determine is was he directing the investigation one way or the other while he was on the investigation is that something that can go back and repair and look and see if there's any kind of bias that's in it obviously I don't think it taints the entire process but it certainly takes taints that season of it and it's something you should look at with any political investigation that he was on at the time and the good news for President Trump is that even if the investigation goes badly for him at this point it's been so politicized that there's gonna be a bevy of people who come out and say this thing is just to political Jeanine Pirro of course will lead the way on Fox News she says that the FBI agents involved should be jailed now this is over the top but it's also the angle a lot of people are gonna take no matter how this investigation goes it all started when Cardinal Comey destroyed our FBI with political hacks to set events in motion to destroy the Republic because they didn't like the man we chose to be our president well it's time to take them out in cups okay so this is obviously over the top from Jeanine Pirro but there will be a lot of people who do who do sort of say this right who move in this direction and Trump knows it so Trump has the upper hand now he has the upper hand on policy it's the end of the year and it appears he's actually to get some things done he knows the investigation doesn't seem like it's going anywhere and so the Democrats are panicked in a second I'm gonna talk about the insane media bias being exhibited in pursuit of President Trump and it really is insane and how they're they're exploding all over themselves but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at thrive

calm / appear use that slash up hero so they know that we sell okay so the media are beginning to pick up on the fact that President Trump actually is in not terrible shape going into 2018 now the Congress the Congress could be in terrible shape going into 2018 and Trump could be in good shape right and this is sort of the problem that you're seeing for president Trump is true for President Obama also so Trump tweeted out this morning that you shouldn't you shouldn't take congressional losses as a referendum on him right here's what he said remember Republicans are five and no in congressional races this year well doesn't count Senate races the media refuses to mention this I said go lesbian more would lose for very different reasons and they did I also predicted I would win I don't know why eyes and scare quotes there again the president needs a remedial course on scare quotes Republicans will do well in 2018 very well and so I mean number one I guess this is a prediction that we can now take to the bank because he's good at predicting things as the president but this idea that Congress is gonna go well because Trump is going well is not really accurate that said Trump's accomplishments this year are greater than they appeared like they were going to be safe three months ago right not only do we have gore since we've have twelve appellate court nominees who have been confirmed we have a tax bill that looks like it's gonna go through repeal of the individual mandate on foreign policy the movement of the embassy to Jerusalem the kickback against the Iran nuclear deal the president is moving I mean there's no question that the Trump and Congress aren't moving they're moving slower than I would like this is their their first real major legislative accomplishment will be this tax reform but it is a major accomplishment for him and he needs it badly right now the poll on the on the tax bills are not great right there's a new Monmouth poll out today showing 26% approve 47% disapprove 50% think their own taxes will go up versus 14% we stay down you know why that is that's because of the media and this is why when President Trump groups the media I think that would be wonderful or the president would stick to the facts because there are so many reasons to dislike how the media cover these things the media is suggesting that people's taxes are going to go up is insane factually speaking the vast majority of human beings in the United States would get a tax cut the media keeps saying this is skewed toward the wealthy well what do you expect non wealthy people don't pay taxes in the United States in fact is middle class upper class people those are the people play taxes and by and large it's upper class people who pay taxes people who don't make a lot of money do not pay income tax in the United States so you think they're gonna get a major tax break but all this business information does have an impact but what's amazing about this is the media do not understand why their credibility is going down now the media have basically expended their credibility to get Trump this is the trade they've been willing to make they're going to go out on a limb and say untrue things plainly untrue things in an effort to stop President Trump and then they're surprised when no one takes them seriously and they're angry that Fox continues to dominate the ratings and they continue to call Fox again a network brian Stelter on CNN yesterday for example he says yo Fox they talk like propagandists over at Fox so like a propaganda network Kurt what is going on here well I think you're seeing exactly that Fox News has basically become de facto state-run propaganda it's at state controlled state-run television that is beginning excuse directly from the White House I don't know how anyone can look at what's going on right now and not reach that termination Trump is not as if the White House is literally running Fox are you saying they are well if you look at the coverage it seems like they are they have gone so far Jim I remember the days Brian when what you saw on pages like Breitbart were considered the fringe it was considered so far beyond the mainstream not even Fox News would touch what was on those pages now Fox is going almost further than Breitbart and you have right now at this second there's an ad running in different markets with Fox News contributor Tommy Lauren advocating and this and attacking the Miller investigation okay so you know I like Kurt but when Kurt does this in CNN humours it then this is a pot-kettle situation okay CNN suggesting that other networks are involved in propaganda let me just show you a panel that was talking about President Trump and misogyny okay if this does not look like propaganda to you then I don't know what what would do you agree with Mike that this has helped Kirsten Gillibrand I do the one piece I disagree with is that President Trump if this was a one-off that would be one thing but this is a guy who was misogynist DNA who ran as a misogynist I'm sure that wasn't on his bumper sticker but that was part of who he was and who he ran as so this is completely aligned with that that's why people heard what they heard from the tweet Jen Psaki CNN political commentator also the former State Department spokesperson for Barack Obama it but they're not a propaganda network right it's not propaganda when Fareed Zakaria over at CNN says that the Republican tax plan is uh showing a bleak future right the universe is gonna end because of Republican tax plans the medium and long term effects of the plan are clear a massive drop in public investment which will come on the heels of decades of declining spending as a percentage of GDP on infrastructure scientific research skills training and core government agencies the United States cannot coast on past investments forever and with this legislation we are assuring in a bleak future really we're ushering in a bleak future because I get to keep more of my own money and I love this idea that we're gonna stop spending where the spending cuts I'm missing the spending cuts yeah there are no spending cuts this is one of the problems with the bill right I would prefer there be spending cuts this idea that oh well we definitely need more money for for infrastructure we definitely need more money for for scientific research right that that's really where the cuts are happening here what is he talking about if there are cuts those cuts are going to come in the form of Medicare or Medicaid or Social Security right that's where the real spending is occurring it's not occurring in the off-brand spending categories the big spending in the United States sixty six percent of the federal budget two-thirds of the federal budget is consumed by Medicare Medicaid Social Security that's where restructuring needs to take place but you wonder why the media is losing credibility at the same time they're attacking the tax plan as the end of the world Americans have a bad opinion of this because the media still has power now this is one area where I think the right is wrong you know the right has been saying for years well you know we now have the upper hand nobody listens to the media anymore people have stopped listening to the media on their character descriptions when the media say that Trump is a racist sexist bigoted homophobic the American people largely just ignore because they'll make their own judgment on that when it comes to the material and Bill's the American people don't have time to read in 1,000 page tax bill and they tend to take the talking points they see on the TV so if you just watch Fareed Zakaria what you would assume is that the Republicans just cut spending by an enormous percentage as opposed to cutting taxes by an enormous percentage because nowhere in there does Fareed Zakaria talk about what actually happens to your taxes a tax plan is about tax reduction a spending plan would be about spending reduction there's nothing about spending in the tax plan it just demonstrates again you know the left wants to say Fox is a propaganda outlet listen Fox has its land but the media have their own slant and President Trump is not wrong to knock the media slant on all of this the media have been imploding and destroying their own credibility on this stuff for quite a while so it's not a tremendous shock to see that President Trump is is surviving and not only will he survive it appears it appears the Moller investigation is not really gonna go anywhere if that happens you're gonna watch the media implode and this sets up a sea is problem for Democrats a really serious problem for Democrats it sets up a problem that the Democrats have set up outsized expectations for their own for their own party I don't need the entire Democratic base believes that Trump is on the verge of falling over if you talk to a Democrat it sounds like Trump is gonna be impeached tomorrow or Trump is going to resign tomorrow or Trump is going to die tomorrow this is how Democrats talk Keith Olbermann said this when he resigned well my job as here has done because it turns out that President Trump he's going to leave right now like they're talking this nonsense for a weapon and they're making it seem as though they're on the verge of impeaching President Trump but the truth is they have no intention of doing any of those things they're not going to impeach President Trump because it would not be politically beneficial for them to impeach President Trump if they were to move against President Trump Trump would actually gain in the polls the same way that Bill Clinton gained in the polls in 1998 when the Republicans moved for impeachment if they were to go after Trump unfairly there would be a rally round the Trump effect it's the opposite of what they want and so the Democrats are now stuck between a rock and a hard place they have been promising that Trump's agenda is going to fail it's not they have been promising the president Trump is going to leave office and ignominious disgrace not that he's not gonna be reelected but that he's going to have to resign due to financial impropriety corruption collusion with the Russians that's not going to happen either and the Democrats are beginning to sense that they are in serious trouble here the Democrats are beginning to sense that if they push this thing too hard there could be a real problem for them so Doug Jones the recently elected senator from Alabama Democrat he was asked should President Trump be should he resign over sexual harassment allegations and Doug Jones knows there's gonna be blowback to him and other Democrats if they push this way so here's Jake Tapper rightly pressing him on it and Doug Jones basically saying no we're gonna leave Trump in place where I am on that right now is that those allegations were made before the election and so people had an opportunity to judge before that election I think we need to move on and not get distracted by those issues let's get on with the real issues that are facing people of this country right now and and I don't think that the president ought to resign at this point we'll see how things go but certainly those allegations are not new and he was elected with those allegations at front center and remember Nancy Pelosi came out and said she was not going to support impeachment right now major Democrats saying they're not gonna support impeachment in fact major Democrats sound like they want to try and work with Trump because they know that Trump may not be going anywhere okay the incumbent always has a major advantage going into a presidential election so Democrats have sold their base a bill of goods and matt is going to come home to them in a serious way it could seriously in 2020 I'll explain why in just a second but first I want to say

slash pen get started today never worry about being clean and looking good again okay so here is the problem for the Democrats they've made all of these big promises to their base Trump is gonna go we've got him on the ropes he's on the verge of falling apart what happens if they don't deliver what happens if they don't deliver what happens if they start moving the long lines of Tim Ryan Tim Ryan is a Democrat and democratic representative from Ohio who says that he may want to work with President Trump now what happens if the Democrats decide to be practical instead of feeding the pie-in-the-sky frenzy that the Bernie bros won or the Hillary or the Hillary Heller harridans are interested in here's Tim Ryan explaining that he'd like to work with the President and then what I'm saying is that this isn't gonna do it President Bush said cut taxes on the wealthiest it's gonna lead to growth wages are gonna go up that in two thousand one two and three that was the the decade with the least amount of growth we've had since the Great Depression and what I'm saying is we need to take down to lappa dated homes we need that we need that trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that the president promised how in God's name are we gonna pay for that if we're borrowing two trillion dollars from China to do the taxes okay what if Trump comes forward early next year with his giant infrastructure plan or what if he calls their bluff what if he says listen I spent it on the taxes okay the tax bill it's done now you owning your infrastructure bill I'm gonna give it to you what did Democrats do do they embrace him do they run away from him or did they do what Bernie Sanders does Bernie Sanders gonna be the only intellectually coherent Democrat he says he's gonna vote against the tax cuts and then he says he'll vote for the infrastructure bill with the knowledge that if Democrats retake Congress they'll have to raise taxes is that a winning plan Trump may have the Democrats in a bit of a trap here because if he cuts taxes and people see a little bit more money in their in their mailbox and it turns out their taxes didn't go up they went down and my taxes I'm one of the few people in America whose taxes will go up in all likelihood thanks to the Trump bill but most people will have a tax reduction if you have that tax reduction and then Trump comes along says I want the infrastructure bill and Democrats vote with him on infrastructure that puts them in the position of now having to argue that they want to raise your taxes again is that a winning political argument does this sound like a winning political argument from Bernie Sanders but if you Democrats take control our corporate taxes going up I think we're going to take a very hard look at this entire tax bill and make it a tax bill that works for the middle class and working families not for the top one percent at large multinational corporations but there's no question that in order to achieve all of the things you want Texas are gonna have to go up on corporations if they're down to 21 as a result of this legislation you can't find the money anywhere absolutely yes so okay in my view absolutely okay so amazing right Trump may have them boxed in because he's actually decreased the the tax revenue and increased the spending forcing Democrats the Democrats who embraced increase spending and also to embrace an increase in taxes now here's the problem for Democrats if they're trapped this way and if they don't move against Trump if they don't try to impeach the president what do they do next where do they go you could easily see a Democrat in 2020 running on a primary ballot or this Ben's ominous is appointed the Federalist I think it's a good one could easily see Democrats going so crazy that Trump is still in office in 2020 but they decide to nominate a Dennis Kucinich type all right some actual nut case they decide to nominate somebody so crazy far to the left that the guy is pledging the moon and then that person goes crazy during the election cycle and they lose to Trump again right you can see Trump winning re-election on the back of this now listen none of this is to say that Trump has the upper hand in 2018 okay because the statistics just don't back that up but if Democrats think that Trump is just going to fade into the woodwork they've got another thing coming especially because the Democrats can't even get their own house in order there's a story out today that four Democratic senators now want to keep Al Franken remember two weeks ago when the Democrats were saying that they wanted the moral high ground on sexual harassment and sexual abuse that was predicated on the notion that Roy Moore was gonna win that Senate seat in Alabama he did not win that Senate seat now Obama and so now the Democrats are left basically with their pants around their feet because what do they do they can have the moral high ground but they're gonna have to oust their guy and the Republicans don't have the moral low ground anymore because they didn't embrace more so what exactly did the Democrats do so now the Democrats are trying to walk it back the Democrats don't want to be in a position of calling on Trump to resign number one and number two Democrats don't actually want to lose half their senators because of sexual harassment allegations when the Republicans don't have to do the same thing remember Roy Moore lost so it doesn't look like the Republicans support sexual abuse and harassment okay so that's actually a political win in some ways for the Republicans so now there are four separate Democratic senators who are saying they want Al Franken to stay because they're afraid of the precedent that this is going to set showing once again that as I said two weeks ago this is not about seizing the world of high ground it was about seizing the political high ground the Democrats now think they don't have the political high ground so they want Franken reinstated okay Joe Manchin of West Virginia he said quote what they did to Elle was atrocious the Democrats he said it's the most hypocritical thing I've ever seen done to a human being and then have enough guts to sit on the floor watching him give his speech and go over and hug him that's hypocrisy at the highest level I've ever seen my life made me sick pat leahy they're not case Democrat from Vermont he had called for Franken to leave apparently he secretly told Franken he regrets doing so two other senators who sided against Franken have apparently told political they'd like to see Frank can stay so now the Democrats are trying to rehabilitate this guy who's photographed nearly grabbing a woman's boobs and has been apparently alleged multiple times to grab women by the but now they're trying to rehabilitate that guy so Democrats are a mess they're unbelievably enough Chris Matthews has now been caught up in the sexual harassment scandal there are allegations that Chris Matthews I was there they say pants settle in tougher employee apparently what happened isn't according to Daily Caller Chris Manning I got up in the morning tell me they show when in the office he said a bunch of sexist things to women unbelievable this is what it said this is what they said over on over on NBC according to NBC News NBC paid severance to a female staffer in 1999 who accused Chris Matthews of sexual harassment Matthews was making inappropriate jokes and comments to this female staffer in front of other people NBC News reported that a confidentiality agreement could not reveal the amount given to the staffer but the Daily Caller reported that it was $40,000 and I'm as NBC spokesperson told NBC News that during that time when the matter was brought up Matthews also received a formal reprimand for what he did alrighty so now Chris Matthews is in trouble and now it turns out that Linda Sarsour shock of shock is in trouble there's a story out today again the Democrats set this standard because they wanted the moral high ground and they won the political high ground on sexual harassment and now they're gonna have to get rid of it because all of their own people are getting caught in the net according to the New York Post controversial Muslim activists and women's March organized a Linda Sarsour bullied in underling to cover up sex abuse allegations in her Brooklyn office ask me falfa Bob told the Daily Caller that a man repeatedly rubbed his crotch on her while she worked for the Association under Saur Saur in 2009 but when faithful Babb reported the abuse Saur Saur a self-proclaimed feminist and co-founder of the women's march organization fat shamed the woman and threatened a blacklist her from political jobs the woman told the website well she oversaw an environment unsafe and abusive to women women who puts our store on a pedestal from women's rights and empowerment deserve to know how she really treats us apparently they the Daily Caller spoke with a bunch of other people about this and they confirmed it so it appears that women's March organizer and feminist icon Linda Sarsour was involved in all of this so the Democrats are now gonna have to give up the moral high ground to regain the political high ground and the irony is just too rich it'll be hilarious if Al Franken is the most well known sexual abuser in the Senate after Roy Moore loses his Alabama Senate race and the Democrats end up with the egg on their face for having to re embrace a guy who they threw overboard five seconds ago well in just a second I want to talk about the things I like and things I hate but you know I want to actually reverse that today so the way that I'm gonna do things today because because I have such a long take on Star Wars is I want to start with our discussion of the Federalist Papers so typically we do the Federalist Papers at the end of the show but now we're gonna do the Federalist Papers a little bit earlier so we've been doing a Federalist paper every week we're now up to Federalist number 8 so Federalist number 8 was written by Alexander Hamilton and Alexander Hamilton in this Federalist paper discusses at length how American wars would be more bloody than European Wars this is his excuse for saying that America needs to be and it needs to be one country as opposed to too many so here is is what Alexander Hamilton says he says in this country the scene would be altogether reversed he says that we'd be more bloody than European wars because in Europe you have a bunch of small standing armies that basically fight one another but they don't threaten civil liberties he says war in America would be a lot more comedy says in this country the scene would be all together reversed the jealousy of military establishments would postpone them as long as possible the lawns of fortifications leaving the frontiers of one state open to another would facilitate inroads the populous states would with little difficulty overrun their less populous neighbors conquests would be as easy to be made as difficult to be retained war therefore would be to solitary and predatory plunder and devastation ever marched in the Train of irregular the calamities of individual would make the principal figure in the events which would characterize our military exploits in other words he says that if there were ever to be wars inside the United States they would be supremely bloody of course Alexander Hamilton ended up being right the bloodiest war in American history is still the civil war he said also that risk of invasion the possibility that your state's going to be invaded by neighbouring state would make people less free because we create standing armies now the founders were really skeptical of standing armies the founders were were not happy with the idea of a professional army that was a huge percentage of the population they understood that there might be a need for a small professional army but the idea of a standing army that was going to basically be quartering itself in people's homes or there's a big draft this is not something they were in love with Alexander Hamilton says the risk of invasion would make people less free he said quote the violent destruction of life and property incident to war the continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger will compel nations the most attached to Liberty to resort for repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights to be more safe they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free and he says that while standing armies are contemplated by the Constitution with the lack of a constitution they become certain he says frequency of invasion will make people less likely to protest lack of Liberty ray says there's a wide difference between military establishments in a country seldom exposed by its situation to internal invasions and in one in which it is often subject to them and always apprehensive of them so this is Alexander Hamilton's excuse for why we need one country not many constant war or the threat of constant war would make it very difficult for the United States to survive as a free country so that's basically Alexander Hamilton's argument there okay so I want to break here on Facebook and YouTube but when we continue

conservative podcast in the nation all righty so time for some things I like and then some things that I hate I wanted to leave a lot of time for things I like and things I hate because I have many a thought on Star Wars and so I'm again going to reverse this so instead of doing the things I like first and then the things that I hate I'm gonna do things I hate first and then the things that I like because I have a sort of like hate thing about Star Wars but I want to do that last because if people don't want it spoiled if you're gonna go see it this weekend I want you to have the ability to tune out right before I do my giant Star Wars review okay so I'm not gonna spoil it for you all of our producers have seen it so I'm not spoiling it for them they've all seen it so I'm not spoiling it for all those people but I'm gonna say all the I'll do the entire show that will get to my Star Wars review and for people who want to stick around for that then you know you won't be threatened by spoilers okay so first the thing that I hate so there's this insane story that has now come out about an entire transgender family it's a local news station in Arizona they've run a glowing piece on a family that is in transition as in the whole family so you've got Daniel Herot the father of the family a 41 year old biological female who identifies as a man and then there's Daniels daughter Mason an 11 year old biological female who now identifies as a boy and his son Josh a 13 year old biological male who identifies as a girl Hey Herod's fiance is also transgender Shirley Austin is a biological male described as tall and blond and smiley who claims to be a woman so in this picture you can see the the blonde woman is a man the black haired man is a woman the boy wearing the black shirt is a girl and the girl wearing the white shirt is a boy right this is the this is the case that they are now making okay so I have my doubts let me just suggest I have my doubts that all of this is entirely genetic okay and there's this argument that's been made that everyone who is transgender there must be some genetic factor that turns everyone transgender the idea that everyone in this family is transgender and there is no environmental impact that a parent deciding that sex is arbitrary and can be changed that has no impact on kids it's just insane to me in the same way that the suggestion that sexual orientation is completely genetic I'll admit that I think part of it is genetic but the idea that all of sexual orientation is completely genetic I find completely unconvincing particularly because identical twins are not one percent of the time either gay or straight it's only about 50% of identical twins who are both gay or both the we're both twins are gay meaning that very often identical twins who are biologically identical one twin is gay and one twin is straight which means there is an environmental component in this the point here is that if you have people who are preaching to their children that sex is completely malleable and that a boy can be a girl in a girl came it boy this might be confusing to children and it might be damaging to children because making a child gender dysphoria may having a tightening the chances your child is gonna suffer from gender identity disorder does not make their life easier it makes it significantly worse and harder the reality is that maybe these kids are gay right sixteen and ninety percent of all kids who identify as transgender grow out of it and most of them identify as gay or lesbian in the future but the idea that this entire family is just genetically gay I mean or rather just genetically transgender I find very hard to to credit if that were the case transgenderism I assume would be a much wider phenomenon and it is not statistically speaking Josh says he was six or seven when he knew as a girl I mean I do wonder at what point Josh found out that that his that his mother was in fact his father and the Daniel says that she knew she was trans quote last year Joshua wanted to join the Girl Scouts despite being raised a boy that's when Daniel was introduced to a word he never heard before transgender when I finally looked it up I realized oh my gosh they're trans and I know it's true because I am too and it's been my whole life amazing how it never occurred to you until it turns out that other people in your family did that and just then it this is not confusing children is is cruel confusing children is evil pretending that sex is completely malleable is evil and to subject children to this sort of activity is is risky at best and and harmful at worst okay so time for some things that I like so here it is folks your spoiler warning okay we've done your spoiler warning you have been warned and there's nothing I can do about it now if you've decided to go this far you're gonna go with us the rest of the way so here's the preface here's a little bit of the preview for Star Wars the last Jedi and then I have many a thought many a thought indeed when I found you I saw raw untamed power and beyond that something truly special or something like me has always been okay so when we first let when we last left off our Sodom just to recap we left off the force awakens so you can stop the preview there when we've when we left the force awakens Ray had randomly been amazing at everything she was the ultimate Mary Sue in science fiction literature she literally came out of nowhere and was incredible with a lightsaber so such that kylo Ren who's supposed to be a guy trading in his youth for about the force trained in using a lightsaber it gets defeated by her in a lightsaber battle the first time she's literally ever picked up a lightsaber which is I'm stupid okay and then they defeated the Starkiller base which was the new Death Star because every other movie we have to have a new Death Star because no one ever has a practical new idea in the Star Wars universe apparently okay and and so we start off this movie and basically it's as though the force awakened never happened essentially the first order is still extraordinarily powerful Reds in the new Empire they're still extraordinarily powerful it didn't matter to them at all that their Death Star got blown up nothing matters and the Rebel Alliance is on the run so it's like Return of the Jedi and it's like the entire Star Wars series never happened right the Empire was never defeated we're basically starting from the exact same point we started in Episode four where the Empire is in control and they and literally it is the beginning of Star Wars Episode four right I mean they're the the Empire ship is chase it the first-order ship is chasing this transport vessel it's literally the beginning of episode four okay so I'm gonna go through some of my minor problems with this and then I will go through some of my major problems so I'll go through my bad things about this movie and my good things about this movie so again the first bad thing is the force awakens apparently never happened I'd be fine with that I didn't like the force awakens I thought that it was a cheesy recasting my biggest problem with with the entire series is what they can't decide in Star Wars land whether they want it to benefit from nostalgia or they want to make it an astrologist centric series or they wanted to launch something new and so they decided to do both and what they ended up doing in the process was killing all of the old things and in preparation for the new and that's nasty to my childhood okay I come from the nostalgia because I thought that the first you know the the new episodes that George Lucas made were terrible the stuff I like is episode four five six right the stuff that everybody likes is is new hope Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi couldn't care less about Phantom Menace or Revenge of the Sith or any of that crap yeah four five and six and where it's at so I grew up with Han Solo I grew up with Luke Skywalker I grew up with Princess Leia in fact my sister's middle name one of my sisters middle names is Leia because I was such a big Star Wars man because my parents asked me what I thought her middle name should be and I picked Lee up because that was a big star Wars fan okay so I am a huge Star Wars nut in the last movie they killed off Han Solo for no reason they turned Han Solo who is one of the coolest most roguish figures who becomes honorable in thin film or they turned him into a loser single dad who can't hold his crap together and gets killed by his whiny brat son for no reason at all I hate like when I remember leaving the theater from the force awakens and thinking oh that wasn't so bad and then the more I thought about it the more it made me want to tear my own teeth out it was just it so if the force awakens had never really happened I'd be a much happier camper also Han would be alive which would be a lot better okay so it starts with that then it's then the force awakens again ends with the idea that the first-order might finally be on the run a little bit they are not at all so okay number two these are minor problems but there are some like basic kind of whole plot holes it starts off with these bombers right these bombers that bomb a dreadnought and the Bombers apparently gravity applies in space which is weird like they actually just drop bombs onto the Dreadnought in space so unless there's an actual gravitational field which I assume would be pulling the the bombers toward the dread-nots which they're not I don't understand how the bombs fall down onto the onto the dread-nots it doesn't make any sense to me that is one problem that that problem is also accompanied by another problem that is a logistical one near the end of the film one of the good people Laura turned in a bizarre turn decides that she is going to run a transport vessel through a Star Destroyer using Lightspeed it's a cool image why has no one ever thought of this in the history of Star Wars especially because if you recall and returned the Jedi there is an actual scene where I started a story goes down because someone does is kamikaze run right on the Star Destroyer remember this returning the Jedi one of the ships kind of flies out of control boom goes right through the control tower and down goes the entire Star Destroyer why's no never thought to use Star em to use Lightspeed as a weapon you could just get rid of the entire first scene or if they knew that Lightspeed was usable as weapon why would they sacrifice a couple of medical ships right there's a point earlier in the film where a couple of ships are they they basically run out of gas and they're blown apart by the first order if they know they have this tactic available why don't you turn one of those ships around and run it with light speed right through the Star Destroyer like this is the ultimate weapon in the universe you could take down the Death Star this way but apparently this has never occurred to anyone until laura dern in her purple hair okay another problem Snoke okay so they make Snoke out to be the big baddie in the force awakens and they make it he's the he's the big baddie he's the scary guy he's the new Emperor and he's so powerful in the forest that he can turn kylo Ren from afar right never be meets kylo Ren and he turns kylo Ren away from Luke that's how powerful he is and this film they showed that he's super powerful because Rey is super power from the forest and he's like throwing around like nothing right he just stops her from doing anything right he's super duper powerful you never find out who he is you never find out what motivates him you never find out where he came from and he gets killed like that right he gets killed as like a literally a hot knife going through butter right they who literally gets killed with a little trick by kylo Ren that is so cheesy and silly that it makes very little sense it makes sense and return to the Jedi right it's it they have an exact Return of the Jedi scene where you have the good guy and the bad guy and they're both in front of the Emperor now in Return of the Jedi it makes sense the Emperor says to Luke take up your your take up your lightsabers strike me down you'll become more powerful than you can possibly imagine Luke does it and Darth Vader stops him right that's cool and it's dramatic here kylo Ren basically just activates it with his mind somebody equipped if only they had lightsaber trigger control this never would have happened if only the NRA had not stumped for for for no gun locks on the on the lightsabers then Snoke would still be alive but the big problem is of course you can't build up a big baddie like that and they not tell him and tell us who he is or why he's there fourth problem kylo Ren who is now the only interesting character left in the Star Wars universe because they've killed everyone is not intimidating this is not a problem with this film this is a problem with the force awakens in the force awakens remember it takes Darth Vader three films three to lose a battle or to be convertible to the light side it takes him three films the first thing you see is Darth Vader is him literally blowing up and strangling somebody picking them up off the ground and strangling him then he dispatches Luke the most powerful Jedi in history he dispatches Luke by chopping off his hand and beating the crap out of him and umpire strikes back right and he's basically beating Luke in Return of the Jedi until Luke basically taps into the dark side of the force so it takes him three movies to get there kylo Ren in the first five minutes of the force awakens we find out it's conflicted and then it turns out he can be bested by Rey the ultimate MarySue which means he's not scary if you're gonna have someone scary heading up the first order that person can't be defeated by a girl who just picked up a lightsaber for the first time ever now if you want to say the girl trained in it fine but she didn't train in it she just picked up and she's fantastic at it why exactly at this point in the film at this point in the series why should the Rebel Alliance be worried look I don't know where they go for episode 9 why should they be worried Rey is significantly more powerful than kylo we know this we've seen it so where's the competition now no clue right and general Hux is not exactly terrifying like general Hux is not the emperor okay another problem Ray's backstory is terrible now I understand what they're trying to do they're trying to make up for the fact this movie I feel bad for Ian Johnson the director and the writer because I feel like who's trying to make up for flaws and the other movies so in this movie with Rey they were basically trying to cure one of the problems that was created by George Lucas with his stupid-ass midi-chlorians nonsense right so George Lucas had this whole thing about you know that the forest runs in your bloodline and this is how we know that you're powerful with the force and all this kind of stuff it was always done well the problem here is that they made a big deal out of the last movie what who is Rey where did she come from and it seems like for some reason she knows Han right there's there's this weird kind of relationship where you remember this Austin it seems like she knows Han in the force awakens it seems like everybody sort of knows who she is but then it turns out that she's just some girl from middle of nowhere which would have been fine except you built it up like there was something interesting about her background so you picked literally the least interesting background for her that you could find and then you and I understand what you're trying to do you're trying to make it that everyone can be participants in the force we're trying to get out of Plato's Republic where there are gradations of human and into the the Democrat the Democratic Society where everyone can be a Jedi I get it I get it but it's not dramatic and then your real way okay another problem III didn't need that entire scene of Luke like milking a sea cow that was just weird oh yeah I just think it was just weird and gross and I wasn't I wasn't big on it but a bigger problem with Luke is it Luke happens to be an incredibly crappy teacher so Luke actually he's making a good point the Jedi do suck in everything okay the Jedi were involved in the original creation of the Empire the Jedi did fail to stop the Sith they basically emboldened the Sith the Jedi were not particularly successful at maintaining the Republic so they stunk in everything so Luke is right about this but he's also a bad teacher right Rey comes and she says I'm gonna offer you three lessons the first lesson is the force exists the second lesson is feel this rock and there is no third lesson right not a good teacher that that guy gets a bad review on college professors calm okay and also Yoda showing up I was moving on okay another problem celebrity cameos as I mentioned before Lordran with purple hair no and Benicio del Toro my god man okay which brings us to that entire storyline no no that entire storyline no okay that's an entire stupid storyline Laura Dern's character could have just told Poe Dameron guess what we're gonna send a bunch of transports to this random planet could they not have just done that instead she pretends like she doesn't like she has no plan it's kind of evil and then what happens is that Poe comes up with some stupid plan to go to to go to like intergalactic Monte Carlo with weird creatures that looks like it's from Harry Potter and their weird dog rabbits that run around camel horses that run around also we can get a bunch of social justice warrior crap about income inequality and animal rights there was the line in this movie so bad that I legitimately was thinking about walking out of the theater and there's a line in this movie we're after Finn who is useless right he is useless and Rose who is double useless they go to this stupid planet and then they free the animals who have been abused oh this is how we know the rebels are good guys because they don't like animals being abused right okay great okay this is a far cry by the way from Empire Strikes Back where Han literally cuts open the belly of a what is it a tauntaun thank you and stuffs Luke inside right but now we have to make sure that all of the rights of the animals are upheld because this is deeply important listen I'm for animal rights but what does Star Wars have to do the animal it's like what the hell and they and and fin turns to Rose and he says well I guess it was worth it you mean losing the entire galaxy was worth you going there to free a few camel horses that will be recaptured five seconds from now was that the thing that was worth it and then the worst line in the film Rose turns to him she takes a saddle off the camel horse dog and she goes now it's worth it what no it's not like it's not like your whole job here is to get this gal that this this hacker guys he can go back to fake Death Star and hack the program no no no no no no also it should have killed Finn okay when Finn is riding at the end directly toward that that giant blaster weapon sword the battering ram he should have just died okay he they should have killed him at the end of force awakens to add some gravitas this is my biggest problem they will not kill any of the new characters because they're trying to preserve the new characters instead they kill all of the old cool characters who I actually like I don't like Finn he's boring I don't care about rose she's boring Wray is only not boring because she has interactions with kylo Ren okay everyone is boring in the new city in the new scenario and they're killing off all of the cool characters who made this thing into a legacy in the first place which brings me to Rose don't even get me started no no no no no okay fine okay Captain phasma also like what she's supposed to be a thing well good cuz she wasn't a thing okay Captain phasma was it like she's there for five seconds she's dressed up as as you know it's Brienne of Tarth too dressed as Bubba Fett he's must be so cool Finn the janitor takes her out fail oh yeah and a few more criticism then I'll get some good stuff okay so the credit wasn't one of criticism at Luke the best moments in the movie aside from the the kylo Ren the the kylo Ren Rey team-up which is the best part of the movie aside from that the best moments of the movie is the part where Luke strides out of the of the cave and kylo Ren has every 8080 fire on him and then Luke just walks right out of it right super cool they then destroy the coolness of this moment by having it be basically a hologram right he's using astral projection from because he's still back at stupid planet why would you do that how'd you do that the entire coolness of it is that he's actually there stopping the blasters it's not cool if they're just shooting a hologram cuz Holograms can't be damaged we all know that why would you do that so in one case we know so the force is used in two ways in this film that we've never seen it used before and we'll never see it used again one it apparently protects you from space death so Princess Leia gets blown out into space she's never used the force at all that we've seen except for one time when she used her mind to reach out to Luke's mind at the end of Empire and now she can suddenly rescue herself from space and fly which is a cool thing I guess like I didn't know this was the thing also if that were a thing why wouldn't the Emperor use it at the Empire at the end of Return of the Jedi alright Luke Darth Vader literally takes the Emperor and throws him down a wormhole sandy throws him down the shaft the Maya shaft right why wouldn't if he can flow I wouldn't just float I'm so confused by this okay so that is one fourth thing that we didn't know about a second force thing we didn't know about is this astral projection nonsense it's so much cooler if Luke is actually there and we and there's precedent for right you could actually build that in because an empire you recall there's a point where Han Solo is invited by Lando to dine with Darth Vader and he takes out his blaster and he shoots star fader and so our favor goes like this and stops the blaster you remember this so Luke is significantly more powerful than Darth how much more powerful well we would find out if they were actually there and he stopped a bunch of athe barrage right that'd be amazing that's true kylo does do that in force awakens kylo does stop a blaster in force awakens that's correct he stops it in the air right then he stopped so kylo can do it but Luke has to be a hologram why why why okay finally this is the biggest problem kylo should have sided with Rey okay if you're gonna do something new you cannot just redo the original trilogy by having kylo be Darth Vader he's just like Anakin he was conflicted and now he's bad and Ray's always good and you can't do that they were building up for this too right like there's a point where Luke explicitly says that Rey does not resist the dark side maybe there was a point where he says that anything okay well maybe the dark side in the light side are actually one force right there's this theory in the Star Wars universe and then there's that great moment where kylo and and Rey team up and you think this is changing the entire nature of the Star Wars universe right you've never seen this before the only team you've ever seen is when Darth Vader makes a final decision right before he dies to toss the Emperor down the mineshaft that's the only time you've seen this in Star Wars universe and it's super cool right when I was in the theater it's packed theater on Saturday night and the audience burst into applause all right the audience started applauding everyone was blown away by that scene right it's a great scene all the way up to and including the whole thing where we're ray tosses him the lightsaber he goes doom and activates it right through the guy's face right dad the whole scene is great and then you immediately blow it then you immediately blow it because there's no real motivation for kylo to say let the transports all be wiped out still there's no motivation there who cares five seconds before this he refused to fire on his mother five seconds right he's not the one who blew princess lay out into space he refused to do it so why does he want to kill her now now he wants to kill her doesn't make any sense so that's all the criticism here's what's right with the film number one it is better than the force awakens okay the force awakens for me was was just a disaster all the way through the reason being that again they took han Solo and made him uncool Luke doesn't end up on coolness in this thing he Lucas cool I just think that his death is a little wasted second the kylo Ren connection really works this was something I didn't expect going into the film I thought at kylo hey Rey but the kylo Ren connection they actually have some chemistry on-screen and every scene where they're basically skyping in to each other all those scenes really work and the scene in the throne room really works the scene where they're working together that's the coolest part and that's why you don't want it to end and that's why when it does end you're annoyed because they just went back to same old same old okay that lightsaber battle also works right that lightsaber battle is one that really that scene is one of the best scenes in all of Star Wars Canon write that one scene I'm not saying the movie I'm saying that one scene is one of the best things in all of Star Wars Canon where where kylo turns and suddenly he and Ray are on the same side it's really cathartic and it's really cool and finally the final thing that works is Luke's final fade-out works just because it's a throwback he gets it he actually gets a death that I guess is is deserving a lot better than Han right Han just gets stabbed through the belly and thrown down another one of these incessant mine shafts that seemed to be everywhere in Star Wars universe but Luke actually gets to do the final Tatooine two sons right gazing off into the distance thing and that works and it's emotionally resonant I just wish you weren't dead because I think that then it was a wasted death they should have ended the film probably after the Kyllo racing and they should have made the entire final part of that movie the third movie right that's that's probably what they should have done okay so is it worth seeing well if you've watched this far you've already seen it because you've heard all the spoilers but my biggest problem now is that I actually think this is the end of the Star Wars universe I think this is actually where it's I think that this is the end of where Star Wars can go because now all the old characters are dead we've reached the end of the Skywalker family essentially like Ben's Solo is a thing I guess but kylo is his own sort of character and they're gonna kill kylo in the next film for sure so why would I show up to watch a movie without Luke Leia is dead right in real life carrie fisher's dead they han is dead what what are they where are they gonna go from here that's not just gonna be more typical light side versus dark side stuff they were on the verge of doing something so great this is what annoys me they were so close to doing something unprecedented right let's say that Rey actually that it kylo says you know what you're right and he calls off the attack and he sister right we're gonna rule the galaxy together and that's the end of the film and you don't know what's gonna happen how's Leia gonna respond to this how Luke's gonna respond to this especially since kylo as you recall just killed Han right wouldn't they like where would it go it sets up all these possibilities instead we're thrust back into sort of this binary universe where okay guess Poe Dameron is gonna take over for Carrie Fisher is the head of a as the head of the the rebellion and and Rey is gonna be the new Luke and kylo is gonna be the new Darth and yeah so I guess this sort of ends the Canon but it did have some moments it did have so okay so there is my full take I think that's pretty fulsome take on star wars and if you have thoughts on that you're always free to email me or tweet me and tell me that I am wrong but we'll be back here at tomorrow the Republicans are set to vote on taxes tomorrow so that will be interesting we'll
