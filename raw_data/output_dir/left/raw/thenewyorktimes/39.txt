1
00:00:02,465 --> 00:00:05,330
Sometimes, a strange
kind of crop sprouts

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,689
in the sandy bottom
of the Red Sea —

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:09,410
eels.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,930
These garden eels
grow up to 3 feet long,

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,160
and about a
half-inch in diameter.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,330
They live in holes in the
sea floor, into which they

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,900
can retreat at any
hint of a predator.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,860
Even when they’re feeding on
tiny animals called zooplankton,

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,840
they stay anchored
in the sand.

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,060
They secrete a kind of mucus
that helps them stay put.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,150
But why stay anchored
if you can swim?

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,680
And they can
if they want to.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,570
Wouldn’t that get
you more food?

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,870
Apparently not.

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,440
In low current,
they stretch out

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,930
and snatch any prey
within reach in any direction.

17
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,630
In a faster current,
when free-swimming fish

18
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,766
have trouble
chasing prey, the eels

19
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,710
adopt a question mark shape.

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,520
That lets them hold steady
and still feed on plankton

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,140
as they sweep by.

22
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,240
An analysis by
researchers found

23
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,240
the drag on their bodies
was up to four times less

24
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,340
than it would have been
if they were straight up —

25
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,400
that is, when the researchers
could find the eels.

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,170
This shapeshifting talent
has allowed these eels

27
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,800
to colonize the sandy sea floor,
where other fish have

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,240
trouble getting a grip.

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, the stay-at-homes
get all the good plankton.
