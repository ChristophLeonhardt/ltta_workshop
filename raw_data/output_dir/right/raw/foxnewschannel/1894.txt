1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:02,903
ACCORDING TO SOURCES, THAT WE

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,938
HAVE HEARD FROM TONIGHT.

3
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:07,140
>> Bret: WE WILL FOLLOW THAT,

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,942
JOHN ROBERTS LIVE ON THE NORTH

5
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,143
LAWN, THANK YOU.

6
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,512
ISRAEL SAID IT STRUCK DOZENS OF

7
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,547
IRANIAN MILITARY TARGETS IN

8
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:14,648
SYRIA OVERNIGHT ON WHAT APPEARS

9
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:17,150
TO BE THE MOST INTENSE FIGHTING

10
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,753
BETWEEN THE TWO MIDDLE EASTERN

11
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,755
RIVALS IN 45 YEARS.

12
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:22,789
A BIG STORY.

13
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:23,590
BENJAMIN HALL IS IN JERUSALEM

14
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,926
NEWSROOM WITH AN UPDATE.

15
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,761
>> THE NIGHT SKY ABOVE DAMASCUS

16
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,963
LIT UP LAST NIGHT AS ISRAEL

17
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,131
LAUNCHED ITS BIGGEST AIR

18
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,133
OPERATION SINCE THE 1973

19
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,669
YOM KIPPUR WAR, TARGETING

20
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,938
URANIAN FACILITIES IN SYRIA.

21
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,506
THE MASSIVE OPERATION SAW 50

22
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,341
SITES HE HAD TO.

23
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,576
IRAN'S MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE

24
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,744
IN SYRIA INCLUDING INTELLIGENT

25
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:45,745
SITES, LOGISTICS HEADQUARTERS,

26
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,380
MILITARY COMPOUNDS, AND

27
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:47,948
WAREHOUSES.

28
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:51,551
THE ATTACKS CAME AFTER IRANIAN

29
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,753
GUARD LAUNCHED 20 ROCKETS AND

30
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,722
ISRAELI TROOPS INSIDE.

31
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,123
THE FIRST TIME IRAN HAS DIRECTLY

32
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,359
TARGETED ISRAELI FORCES.

33
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,963
>> IRAN CAUSED THE REDLINE.

34
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:03,730
OUR REACTIONS WERE ACCORDING TO

35
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:03,997
IT.

36
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,167
TO SPEAK OF THE ROCKETS WERE ALL

37
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,935
INTERCEPTED OR FELL SHORT.

38
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,738
BUT NEVERTHELESS, THIS WAS A

39
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,440
MAJOR ESCALATION BY IRAN, ISRAEL

40
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,874
HAS ALWAYS SAID THAT IT WOULD

41
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,510
NEVER ALLOW IRAN TO SET UP

42
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,646
PERMANENT PERMANENT MILITARY

43
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,214
BASES, BUT THEY HAVE DONE JUST

44
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,749
THAT BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE

45
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,152
CHAOS OF THE CIVIL WAR.

46
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:26,820
THEY SAID THE RESPONSE WAS

47
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,755
WORDED.

48
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,991
>> IF IT RAINS IN OUR COUNTRY,

49
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:31,992
IT WILL POUR THERE.

50
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,260
I HOPE THAT WE HAVE FINISHED

51
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,896
WITH THIS AND THAT EVERYBODY

52
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:37,297
UNDERSTOOD.

53
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,166
>> TONIGHT THERE IS AN UNEASY

54
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:40,900
PEACE, MILITARY REINFORCEMENTS

55
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,236
HAVE BEEN MOVED TO THE NORTH OF

56
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,805
ISRAEL, BUT THE PRESIDENT SPOKE

57
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,440
TO ANGELA MERKEL AND SAID THAT

58
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,743
HE DOES NOT WANT AN ESCALATION

59
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:50,510
EITHER.

60
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,578
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS

61
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,014
DISTANCED ITSELF FROM THE ROCKET

62
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,148
ATTACK, ALTHOUGH SOME SYRIAN

63
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,750
FELLOW CIVILITIES WERE USED.

64
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,853
EUROPEAN SOURCES SAY THAT THE

65
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,155
MONEY USE THEM WITHOUT

66
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:02,689
PERMISSION.

67
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,157
IF THE SYRIANS HAD BEEN

68
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,226
INVOLVED, ISRAEL HAVE MADE HIT

69
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:10,130
THEM TOO.

70
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,531
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WAS IN MOSCOW

71
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,699
VISITING VLADIMIR PUTIN, THOUGHT

72
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,135
THAT HE WAS GOING TO PERSUADE

73
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,570
HIM TO PREVENT SYRIAN ALLIES

74
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,571
FROM ATTACKING ISRAEL.

75
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,107
IT APPEARS THAT THIS HAS NOT

76
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,742
WORKED.

77
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,912
>> AND THERE HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD

78
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,314
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL

79
00:02:28,314 --> 00:00:00,000
STRACK AGAINST IRAN AND SYRIA.
