1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,600
UNITED AIRLINES IS IN TROUBLE
AGAIN AFTER A FAMILY FROM

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,920
TEXAS AS THEIR DOG DIED WHILE IN
THE CARGO HOLD OF A PLANE

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,500
THAT WAS DELAYED FOR TWO HOURS.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,610
THE DOG IS NAMED LULU.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,510
LULU WAS A FIVE-YEAR-OLD
CAVALIER KING CHARLES

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,579
SPANIEL AND WAS CLEARED BY A
VETERINARIAN TO FLY DAYS

7
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:24,599
BEFORE LULU WAS BOARDED ON THE
PLANE.

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,189
THE FAMILY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS
GOING ON SO FAR.

9
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:33,160
UNITED HAS RESPONDED WITH A
STATEMENT.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:52,780
INTERESTINGLY, SINCE 2012,
ONE THIRD OF ALL ANIMAL TESTS

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,510
ON US CARRIERS OCCURRED ON
UNITED AIRLINES.

12
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,450
I LOOKED UP, THERE WERE 136

13
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,010
ANIMAL TESTS ON US PLANES DURING
THAT TIME.

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,069
53 WERE ATTRIBUTED TO UNITED
AIRLINES A.

15
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,118
THAT IS INSANE.

16
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,579
THEY SAY ON THE RARE
OCCURRENCE.

17
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:09,579
THAT ISRAEL GIVEN THE NUMBER
OF FLIGHTS THERE IS, BUT

18
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:13,600
APPARENTLY A LITTLE LESS RARE IF
IT IS ON UNITED.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,049
LOOK, THEY'RE DIFFERENT AIRLINES
HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES FOR

20
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:19,049
DIFFERENT REASONS.

21
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,359
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'S A GREAT
BOOK ABOUT WHY KOREAN AIRLINES

22
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:25,799
CRASH MORE IN THE PAST, NOT
TODAY AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THE

23
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,580
COPILOTS, BECAUSE OF CULTURAL
REASONS, WERE TOO POLITE

24
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,080
THAT EVEN IF THEY WERE ABOUT TO
MOVE INTO A MOUNTAIN, THEY

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,469
WOULD NOT SELL THE PILOT, HEY,
WATCH OUT WE ARE ABOUT TO DIE.

26
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:37,549
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TOO RUDE AND
SO THEY WOULD CRUSH INTO

27
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:42,170
THE MOUNTAIN EVERYONE WITH THAT
WHICH SEEMS A LITTLE ROUTER.

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,119
THAT IS A REAL STORY.

29
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:45,119
IT IS
AMAZING, DIDN'T HAPPEN

30
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,070
FREQUENTLY, BUT HAPPENED
MORE FREQUENTLY ON KOREAN

31
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,090
AIR IN THE PAST.

32
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,340
THEY'VE CORRECTED FOR IT.

33
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,789
THERE'S SOME CHANCE THAT UNITED
IS DOING SOMETHING A LITTLE

34
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,789
WRONG.

35
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:58,649
IN THIS PARTICULAR
CASE, THEY SAY THE AIR

36
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,539
CONDITIONING HAD GONE OUT IN THE
MAIN CABIN.

37
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:05,649
IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR THE
DOG IN THE CARGO HOLD.

38
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:08,179
THAT IS VERY LIKELY WHAT
HAPPENED, BUT THEY WANT TO

39
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:09,600
INVESTIGATE FIND OUT FOR SURE.

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,180
WHAT I NEVER UNDERSTAND IS
FIRST OF ALL, WHAT ARE THEY

41
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,280
BORED PEOPLE ON THE PLANE WHEN
THEY KNOW OR BEFORE THEY

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,590
HAVE CHECKED TO MAKE SURE THAT
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE STUCK

43
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,920
ON THE TARMAC FOR A COUPLE OF
HOURS BEFORE THE FLIGHT

44
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,030
HAPPENS OR WHY DON'T YOU MAKE
SURE THAT WHEN WE LAND,

45
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,350
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO STAY
ON THE TARMAC FOR SEVERAL

46
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,720
HOURS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT IS
A COMMON THING.

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,650
THERE BEEN MULTIPLE TIMES WHERE
YOU ARE STUCK ON THE TARMAC

48
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,810
FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN ADDITION TO
THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU'RE STUCK

49
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,980
ON THE PLANE AND MIRACULOUSLY,
THEY'RE CONDITIONING ALWAYS

50
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,350
NOW FUNCTIONS WHEN YOU ARE STUCK
ON THE TARMAC.

51
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,260
THERE WAS A STORY THAT WE DIDN'T
GET TO A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO

52
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,800
WHERE PEOPLE WERE LITERALLY
STUCK ON THE PLANE ON THE TARMAC

53
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,620
FOR OVER FIVE HOURS AND PEOPLE
STARTED THROWING UP BECAUSE

54
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,880
AIR-CONDITIONING WASN'T WORKING.

55
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,880
THEY WERE GIVING OUT FOOD.

56
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,950
THE ONLY THING THAT THEY WOULD
GIVE OUT WAS WATER AND IT

57
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,180
IS JUST RIDICULOUS.

58
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,370
ONE PERSON ACTUALLY CALLED 911.

59
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,460
AN AMBULANCE SHOWED UP AT THEY
SAID WE CAN'T TAKE YOU OFF

60
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,570
THE PLANE.

61
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,870
I DON'T GET WHY IT IS SO
DIFFICULT TO GET THE PEOPLE

62
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,350
OFF OF THE PLANE ESPECIALLY
IF YOU HAVE SEVERAL

63
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,920
INDIVIDUALS THROWING UP.

64
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,121
I DON'T KNOW, IT IS THIS WEIRD
AIRLINE POLICY THAT I'VE

65
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:22,810
NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT I'M SURE
THERE MIGHT BE A GOOD

66
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,780
REASON FOR IT, BUT IT IS NOT A
GOOD IDEA.

67
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,720
I FEEL BAD FOR PET OWNERS.

68
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,500
I HAVE A PET TO, BUT PUTTING IT
ON A PLANE IS A LITTLE BIT

69
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,580
DANGEROUS.

70
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,880
WE DON'T KNOW WHY THEY HAVE ALL
THE ISSUES THAT THEY DO AND

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,060
I'VE COURSE HAD A SOMEWHAT
INFAMOUS FIGHT WITH AMERICAN

72
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,760
AIRLINES WHERE I THOUGHT THEY
WERE ACTING IRRATIONALLY

73
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,240
AND BY THE WAY, WAS PROVEN RIGHT
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THEY

74
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,860
DID HAVE A PLANE WERE CHOOSING
NOT TO BRING IT SO SOMETIMES

75
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,760
THEY ARE IN A DIFFICULT SPOT AND
THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO.

76
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,380
SOMETIMES THERE IS SOMETHING
THEY CAN DO, THEY JUST

77
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,330
DON'T WANT TO DO IT BUT IF YOUR
PET IS IN THE CARGO HOLD AND

78
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,560
IT THEN IT BECOMES A LITTLE BIT
MORE MATTER OF URGENCY FOR YOU.

79
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,450
HEY WE HAVE TO FIX THIS THING,
OTHERWISE LULU IS GOING TO DIE.

80
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,130
I LOOKED INTO IT TOO, A
LOT OF PEOPLE ONLINE OR

81
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,140
ORGANIZATIONS ONLINE SEEM TO
HAVE AN ISSUE WITH PLACING

82
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,540
ANIMALS IN THE KERNEL TO BEGIN
WITH BECAUSE THEY ARE

83
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,420
LIVING CREATURES AND THEIR
DIFFERENT CONDITIONS DOWN THERE.

84
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,750
ACCORDING TO PETA, 300 ANIMALS
HAVE DIED IN CARGO HOLDS IN

85
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,750
U.S. AIRPLANES SINCE 2005.

86
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,400
IT GOES BACK TO WHAT YOU WERE
SAYING.

87
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,780
WHY THIS NEEDLESS REGULATION,
WHY DOES THIS DEFY COMMON

88
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,350
SENSE EVEN THOUGHT WE ARE
GOING TO DO THIS?

89
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,440
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE?

90
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,500
DOES IT
HELP PEOPLE?

91
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,280
I'M NOT SAYING IT IS AN EASY
ISSUE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

92
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,250
YOUR PIT BULL SITTING NEXT TO
ME.

93
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,690
WE'RE STUCK IN A PLANE, IF
WE ARE STUCK WITH NO

94
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,840
AIR-CONDITIONING FOR FIVE HOURS
AND A PITBULL IS BREATHING

95
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,700
DOWN MY NECK, I'M NOT
IN FAVOR OF THAT.

96
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,490
I'M KEEPING IT
REAL ABOUT THAT.

97
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,620
IF HE IS IN THE CARGO HOLD, AND
THE OTHER HAND, IT'S GOING TO

98
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,940
ALMOST CERTAINLY DIE AND I
DON'T WANT YOUR DOG TO DIE.

99
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,680
WE
DON'T HAVE A GREAT

100
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,690
ANSWER HERE.

101
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,970
YOU GO WITH WHAT IS GOOD FOR
HEALTH AND BEING ON LIVE.

102
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,980
IT'S A BALANCE.

103
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,980
I GET IT.

104
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,980
I'M A DOG OWNER, I
LOVE DOGS SO SOMETIMES I

105
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,060
DON'T CONSIDER HOW OTHER PEOPLE
FEEL ABOUT DOGS BECAUSE IN

106
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:33,830
MY EYES 

107
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:40,050
IT IS LIKE YEAH, JUST
LET THE DOG ON THE PLANE.

108
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:47,710
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

109
00:05:47,710 --> 00:06:16,560
WHAT IS ABOUT TO BE IN 

110
00:06:16,560 --> 00:00:00,000
THE CARGO
HOLD, BUT YOU ARE RIGHT.
