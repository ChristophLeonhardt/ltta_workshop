PLANET THAN ANY OTHER AMERICAN. 665 DAYS SPANNING THREE SPACE STATIONS AND THE SPACE STATION MISSIONS. THE SECOND ROUND OF THE U.S. OPEN GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW BEHIND ME. YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE ACTION THIS WEEKEND ON THE FOX BROADCAST NETWORK JOINING ME NOW TO TALK ABOUT GOLF IN THE FUTURE OF GOLF IS THE UNITED STATES GOLF ASSOCIATION CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MIKE DAVIS. MIKE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST. THIS IS THE TROPHY? THIS HAS THE TROPHY THAT HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE 1895. THAT'S FANTASTIC. TO HEAR THE CHEERS COMING FROM THE GOLF COURSE, EVERYONE IS TRYING TO MAKE THE CUT RIGHT NOW. THIS HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING TWO DAYS. THIS IS A TOUGH PLACE. IT IS ONE OF THE FIVE FOUNDING CLUBS OF THE USGA, AND IT TRULY IS A GREAT TEST OF GOLF BUT IT WAS THE TALE OF REALLY TWO DAYS. YESTERDAY SOME OF THE HIGHEST WINDS WE'VE EVER HAD AT U.S. OPEN AND PLAYERS WERE JUST HANGING ON. YET TODAY, REALLY GOOD SCORING FOR THE CONDITIONS. VERY LIGHT WIND AND SOME SOFT CONDITIONS AND THEY CAN GO LOW WHEN THAT HAPPENS. SO DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAD TO SET IT UP TOUGHER BECAUSE LAST YEAR WAS 16 AND UNDER? YOU DIDN'T GET TO 16 OTHER THIS YEAR? IN SO MANY CASES, MOTHER NATURE HAS A BIG SEAT AT THE TABLE. LAST YEAR SHE WAS VERY CALM TO THE PLAYERS BUT SHE'S DOING A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS THIS YEAR. I THINK IN SOME WAYS YOU TRY TO SET THIS GOLF COURSE UP, AND ANY U.S. OPEN GOLF COURSE, SO YOU ARE TESTING EVERY ELEMENT OF THE PLAYER'S SKILL. SO THE COURSE MANAGEMENT SKILLS, EVEN THE ABILITY TO HANDLE THEIR NERVES. THIS IS A GREAT GOLF COURSE AND A GREAT TEST OF GOLF. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT GOLF AS A GAME AND WHERE IT'S GOING? VERY HEALTHY GAME. WE HAVE MORE JUNIOR GOLFERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER. SO IN A SENSE, AND THE GAME IS GLOWING GLOBALLY. IT'S A GAME OF A LIFETIME, IT'S LIKE OTHER SPORTSWEAR PLAYERS OF DIFFERING ABILITY CAN PLAY ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS THROUGH THE HANDICAP SYSTEM. BUT AT THE SAME TIME GOLF HAS ITS CHALLENGES. ONE THING THAT GOLF CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON IS HOW LONG IT TAKES TO PLAY THE GAME. THEN THERE ARE EVEN LONG-TERM ISSUES, AND IT WILL BE A BIGGER ISSUE IN THE DECADES TO COME. IT IS ABOUT THE LONG-TERM HEALTH AND ENJOYMENT OF THE GAME FOR ALL THOSE WHO PLAY AT. Bret: FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T WATCH GOLF RELIGIOUSLY, WHY SHOULD THEY WATCH THIS WEEKEND? THIS IS OUR NATION'S NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. IT'S THE OLDEST CHAMPIONSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY, IT'S BEEN AROUND SINCE 1895. THIS WEEK IS TRULY UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT, THIS IS THE ULTIMATE TEST OF GOLF. THIS IS UNLIKE OTHER WEEKS OF THE YEAR WHERE WE ARE TESTING EVERY ELEMENT OF THE SHOTMAKING SKILLS. FOR WELL OVER A CENTURY, THESE GOLFERS KNOW THAT THE U.S. OPEN TOUGH TEST TO GOLF, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WILL HAND OF TROPHY OUT RIGHT HERE AND AT THE JACK NICKLAUS GOLD MEDAL TO THE LOW 72 HOLE SCORE. I CAN PROMISE YOU, IT'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY THAT HAS WORKED THEIR WAY AROUND THIS GOLF COURSE AND DONE A GREAT JOB IN TERMS OF THINKING THEIR WAY THROUGH. Bret: RIGHT NOW DUSTIN JOHNSON IS LEADING. HE HAS THESE GUYS THAT ARE HITTING GARGANTUAN DISTANCES AND IT'S CHANGING THE GAME? THE GAME HAS EVOLVED. IT HAS INNOVATED ITSELF. WHEN WE PLAYED THIS CHAMPIONSHIP WELL OVER 100 YEARS AGO IN 1896, THE COURSE WAS ONLY 4400 YARDS. NOW IT'S ABOUT 7400 YARDS. COURSES HAVE HAD TO EXPAND OVER THOSE PERIODS OF TIME, BUT DISTANCE IS ONLY ONE ELEMENT OF THE TEST. YOU KNOW, IT'S YOUR ABILITY TO BE ACCURATE WITH THE BALL, DISTANCE CONTROL, YOUR ABILITY TO WHEN YOU GET IN TROUBLE, RECOVER. AND ULTIMATELY, THINK YOU ARE WAY AROUND THE GOLF COURSE. BACK IN 1896, THAT WINTER GOT A A FEW BLOCKS, BASICALLY $150. AND IN FIRST PLACE THIS YEAR, 2.1. SECOND PLACE GETS MORE THAN THE 2,000 FOR WINTER. I'M I WONDER WHEN HE WAS PLAYING, IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT FROM AN INFLATIONARY SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK $150 WOULD EQUAL
