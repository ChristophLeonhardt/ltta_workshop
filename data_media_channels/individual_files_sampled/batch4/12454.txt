let's get off of these questions of natural law and souls and everything get on to the real battle the war on Christmas here is a glimpse right now from the battlefield just outside our window no they got him they got him they got Santa Santa down I got to put on my helmet for this this is it still lit up yeah it is okay alright ready to go I don't have my candy cane pipe anymore Matt I read it I usually I love your writing I love reading your pieces you wrote a piece a couple days ago that I almost threw my computer at the window I was so horrified I wanted to bring you up on charges marshal charges for evacuating your post in the war on Christmas you don't think it's a real thing you don't think conservatives should be worried about it no not at all I think it's it's if you think it's ridiculous I well that is not mean that's not that's practically yeah my Christmas tree bow tie I I think it's even dumber than the standing the NFL think I'll be honest with you I there there there are two aspects to it the question is is it is it an important issue like is there something we should worry about and the other question is should we even is it even is it helping Christmas in other words when we try to essentially force people to say Merry Christmas and to decorate their department stores with with mistletoes and plastic reindeer and everything and so on that second I think I move right to that second question I would say that it's it's I don't think that we we help Christmas in other words if you have what would we consider an act of war on Christmas if like for instance if Macy's were to say we're banning Christmas decorations you're not allowed to say Merry Christmas right then that's that's the war on Christmas isn't it's the latter though because it they still have the decorations the decorations are up everywhere it's not like we forced them to people put them up because if they put them up earlier and earlier actually because they want to get people to buy more presents and these sort of things the the act of the war on Christmas and why I think it's so insidious is it's all about language it's just a front in this politically correct euphemistic battle so what they do is they have all the the reindeer even they have the little Christmas snowflakes or whatever but they won't they won't call it Christmas they'll say it's for the holidays they use this euphemism holidays even though there's only one major holiday in December so how let me ask you how is the sacredness of Christmas preserved by having the cashier JCPenney just have this wrote greeting of Merry Christmas as opposed to saying happy holidays which by the way as you know holidays means holy day so they're still acknowledging but they say holidays but if there's only one there's only one major holiday in December what's the other holiday Hanukkah is a relatively minor Jewish holiday compared to other Jewish holidays it only became a busy day of Saint Nicholas the this is actually another point on this so you do make a great point obviously Christmas is commercialized a lot of people there the Christmas and Easter Christians they go to church twice a year maybe usually once a year and they don't go any other day and that's a problem I totally grant that that's a problem but it isn't hypocrisy the tribute the device pays to virtue is it is that situation really made better by indulging this bizarre campaign to replace Christmas the obviously the central holiday of Christmas time with this weird euphemism holidays where we pretend that Hanukkah is a major holiday even within the Jewish religion and the Kwanzaa is anything but a socialist contrivance it seems to me you know Santa we have Santa Claus up what does Santa Claus have to do with the birth birth of Christ not terribly much except that this folk tradition that we have the merging of the of Christianity with these various folk traditions does speak a little bit to it we have Saint Nicholas so we have st. Nicholas is known for two things giving up presents to people and punching heretics in the face and we incorporate the former into our Christmas traditions that doesn't seem like such a bad thing to me yeah I would love to incorporate the latter to it right the Walsh household if I started doing that at Macy's but I I guess the here's here's the way I look at it if a department store a company or whatever says don't say Merry Christmas a Happy Holidays their logic partly is well we can't really wish because Christmas means Christ mass as you know it's it's a very religious phrase and it's it's it's intensely religious so the the the logic of these corporations is well if we say that then we're essentially endorsing that religion we're promoting it and and so they say well we're a secular company we're not interested in promoting a religion so we're just going to back off and not and not say anything or just use this generalized phrase and my point is in that decision they're actually showing more respect even if not intentionally but they're showing more respect for the religious nature of Christmas then are a lot of Christians who only care about Christianity when it's Christmas time but then shouldn't they not use the word holy day shouldn't they not use the phrase holidays that they're saying we don't want to take a religious stand because I think they're not using it for that reason I think they're not doing it because there's a left-wing euphemistic struggle that infects all of our politically correct language christmas is just one little aspect of that but by that logic if there is only one major holiday that is celebrated in december shouldn't they just not acknowledge anything if they're going to acknowledge that there is something there is a holiday that must not be named because we're respecting the religious nature of of this country and of the people who celebrate christmas then they should take down the ornaments right they should take down the snowflakes and the trees and the reindeer so my so my I guess I would I guess my problem with the war on Christmas is that they're not going far enough take take the tech to take it all down I don't it's because I don't need this this this the way that Christmas is so ubiquitous it's only drained at of its significance I think it would be great we live in a part of the point I made in that piece we live in a godless satanic culture we should have to face that fact even around Christmas I know we want to run from that and we want to pretend we're driving down the street we see the Christmas lights everywhere was it well look at all these Christians are so great and meanwhile you know those people the Christmas lights are in their house you know they're looking at porn there whatever beating their kids whatever they're doing so what you want to do you want to take down the reindeer and you want to replace them with little devils and little like balances it's I think it would be good if we got to a point in our culture where only the people who are authentically really devoutly observantly Christian even acknowledge or celebrate Christmas because they're the only ones who should be they're the only ones it it's it's this is not a holiday for everyone to enjoy the spirit of Christmas is giving to people it's not what it is we're celebrating the birth of Christ because he came to this earth to redeem mankind that's why we're celebrating him and so it's the people who actually care about Christianity who have a right to our celebration I don't like how our culture comes in and takes all of the Christmas all the Christian celebrations and givers gets rid of all the religious significance and they just keep that they keep the celebrations for themselves to do with Mardi Gras they do it sort of with you know they do I certainly do it Mardi Gras yeah they do with Saint Patrick's Day it's you know these are ours we we earned those holidays in a sense culturally appropriating from us they already did away on this point though the the Incarnation does draw all of the nations in the world into Christ even though you know we see those three wise men come from the land of the sunrise they weren't Jews they lived at a time when there was there were prophecies floating around that the ruler of the world would come from Judah but even in that incarnate in the first year of incarnation you see a journey of the world who might be kind of kooky and their religious views are a little out there or not quite there might be Magi from which we get magician but they were drawn a little closer to Christ it seemed I'm looking at it a little more glass-half-full if we can get them to like Santa Claus this happened to Andrew Clavin he really liked Christmas as a boy even though he came from a basically secular Jewish household and years later that played some role in his conversion to Christ you know what in a way that didn't involve Christmas cookies and you know little decorations on the tree because I think in where I disagree with you Matt is what you're talking about is a society that completely totally takes away their decorations and it's gone and it's everything that's not a society that takes away their decorations and we're gonna let the Christians do their thing that's a society like the Soviet Union they don't just take the decorations down they ensure that nobody puts any decorations up so we're in a post-christian society right now but we are not yet fully in an anti-christian society yet and so long as that shell of a Christian society remains we have to protect that shell so we can fill it up with something Christian because that natural law of being around the beauty of the decorations of Christmas and hearing people say Merry Christmas and Santa Claus like he said about Andrew Clavin could play a role in somebody's conversion later on I know how to do it I know how to make all of this work and to unite all of these various armies some who want more Santa Claus and some who want the war to go further and you know have the devil's go up we can we have to add this important component of punching heretics to our Christmas traditions yes Saint Nicholas as Santa Claus himself would have wanted fala Lala la lalalala
