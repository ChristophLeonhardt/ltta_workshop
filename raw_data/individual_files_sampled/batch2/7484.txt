following Trump's executive action essentially ending subsidies to private insurers to help keep costs low for the poorest Americans so they can afford health care there was a bipartisan effort by senators Lamar Alexander and patty Murray to continue the funding for another two years until they can come up with a better solution now after this legislation was made public trump stated just as recently as yesterday that he was supportive of the efforts however he has completely changed course today in fact he changed course last night and decided that he was no longer supportive of the legislation now he's saying I am supportive of Lamar meaning senator Lamar Alexander as a person and also of the process but I can never support bailing out insurance companies who have made a fortune with Obamacare also speaking to reporters later Wednesday Trump said that if something can happen that's fine but I won't do anything to enrich the insurance companies so again he has completely flip-flopped on this issue and it seems as though he is no longer supportive of this bipartisan effort so let's dive into in this case it's a little bit of hypocrisy but it's mainly the Trump doesn't know what the hell he's talking about before he flip-flopped he had said this is a bipartisan compromise it was a quote short-term solution so that we don't have this very dangerous little period for insurance companies so that's a dangerous period for insurance companies and he doesn't want them to be in danger then he flips around and goes I'm not supporting bailout of insurance companies they're already getting too rich wait do you have any idea what you're doing you know what's in the bill you know what's in your executive order and which side are you on it does whoever he talked to last and and and so yesterday talks to the establishment Republicans in fact we showed you he was he had met with Mitch McConnell they whispered sweet nothings in his ear and he's like oh yeah that makes sense true this is a dangerous period for the insurance companies we have to protect insurance companies our donors right bitch Yeah right okay great comes out and says that and then he talks to whoever I don't know if it's Steve Bannon or some populist or whatever and oh no I'm sorry it's actually I know it is this Club for Growth and and the incredibly rich donors and now there's donors on a couple of different sides here right but the donors who want to kill Obamacare the reason they want to do it took like Club for Growth is because remember there's still that seven hundred billion dollars in tax cuts that the rich can get if you get rid of Obamacare completely and the Club for Growth represents those guys so Club for Growth comes in and goes mr. president no no the insurance companies are getting bailouts now you want to know what what the reality is the insurance companies are yes it's true they're getting money from the government is it a bailout no it is to subsidize low income Americans who otherwise can't afford insurance otherwise the insurance company goes there's no profit in insuring them and I'm not going to do it so the only reason to do it is so that those guys are insured that you could assure them in different ways you could do it directly through the government but then they would howl even more right so it's not necessarily to help insurance companies is to help low-income Americans and Club for Growth thinks I'm not a low-income American I want tax cuts for the rich and I don't give a damn what happens to low-income Americans they're gonna lose their insurance I don't care of course they don't care but you know there's something that I haven't seen a lot of discussion about and I'm curious if you noticed this as well so as we know if Trump doesn't get exactly what he wants he will intimidate Congress he will bully Congress but if he doesn't get exactly what he wants he will do what he wants unilaterally through executive action and that's what happened with ending these subsidies for these insurance companies so you know they can subsidize low income earners so they can afford insurance it's interesting that his executive order attacked that specifically rather than the mandate right because that was one of the issues that those on the right have been furious about you're forcing us to buy insurance you're forcing us to do this and that which by the way the whole point of the mandate even though I think it's it's a flawed system was the pressure young people young healthy people to also buy insurance to keep the costs low for those who would otherwise have even higher premiums but why didn't he get rid of that so the mandate stays in place but the subsidies end meaning premiums will increase if you're poor and you can't afford that insurance you're gonna have to pay that tax penalty at the beginning of the year when you file your taxes like I don't know if he thought this through or if this was done intentionally but I find it interesting that the first thing he did was attack the subsidies and if he wanted to attack the subsidies why didn't he also go after the the mandate as well so I have answers first of all did he think it through of course that he's never thought anything through in his life if you said to him name the thing that you took away with an executive order last week there's no way he can do it it's cost-sharing reductions I got rid of a lot like the thing the thing with the insurance company was it was outrageous and I got rid of it okay okay but what is it called many people told me that they were happy about that executive order many people it was a beautiful big beautiful executive order okay but what was it about anyway so so and Schumer got really frustrated because remember in the thing that he's now against was a bipartisan compromise the Republicans and Democrats negotiated and came up with a compromise and Schumer is like he doesn't know what's in the bill and so he keeps flip-flopping because he's never read it so what's the real answer what's going on it's because Club for Growth steps in and goes hey Donald Trump and by the way Paul Ryan - and Paul Ryan is the most man in America and you guys are now going to oppose this otherwise you're gonna lose your donor money and so they and why do they do it because not only does it help the rich eventually but it it's not that they are gratuitous ly wanna hurt the poor I don't think they're evil all right I don't think so you might disagree with me it's because they know that the poor are powerless and can't fight back so the first thing they're gonna take away is anything that helps the poor and they are funded by wealthy Americans so they tell Trump that thing you don't know what it is go back to taking it away and he's like oh okay alright wait are you with Trump are you gonna give big beautiful money donor money to Donald Trump you are okay great then I'm with you I'm back to with you I'm gonna put a tweet on that if you like The Young Turks you'll love Young Turks membership TYT Network dot-com / joy
