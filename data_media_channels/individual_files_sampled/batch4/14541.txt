robert muller again reveals his true motives special counsel robert muller is doing something that has me and many others just shaking our head not at why he's doing it but as at his boldness in doing it he is now going to offer limited use immunity who Tony Podesta for testimony against Paul Manafort you heard that right another person close to the Clintons is going to be getting immunity limited use immunity what that means in simple terms is that nothing Tony Podesta says in his testimony against Matt affort can be used against him in that specific line of questioning and testimony but if other things arise out of it if investigators are look into statements he makes and they find crimes part and parcel to what the looking into then he could theoretically be charged with those so that's the concept of limited use immunity but the mere fact that Tony Podesta is being offered any immunity to me anyway reinforces the theory that Robert Muller and the Special Counsel was that insurance policy that Peter struck and Lisa page discussed in and these office that we found out about when their text messages weren't released this is as bad as it gets optically for this nation Muller knows what he's doing he doesn't care this tells me that Muller has one mission who discredit Donald Trump if they go Donald Trump did anything illegal him in charge - it would have tried to charge him I don't believe you can charge a sitting president with federal crimes because he didn't pardon himself but they'd have tried they'd have charged people around him and his family they've got nothing so they leak and they leak and now now because they have nothing criminal on Trump or anybody really close to him remember general Flynn only got jammed up for false statements they never found any collusion which isn't legal anyway but any criminal conspiracy with Russia this is all done for one reason discredit Donald Trump and make an impeachment case this is as bad as it gets but the optics of another Clinton person only Podesta John Podesta like this with the Clintons the optics of one moron ton on the side of Clinton getting immunity while nobody on Trump's side being offered immunity Elle's America the true motives of Robert Miller and rod Rosen's time we talked about this last week when Rosen Stein called that ridiculous press conference last week they announced the indictment of 12 Russian officials but what happened Putin said sure come interview our people we're gonna come interview yours and then when Donald Trump floated the idea of one of those people he might allow the Russians to question being ambassador McFaul Obama's ambassador to Russia well all of a sudden now it's a terrible idea and you can't do this oh my god no because now a member of Team Obama might be touched now you can't do it now it's terrible so then of course after McFaul is offered up the special counsel's office leaks that Tony Podesta is being given immunity this is now this is now Robert Muller and Rob Rosenstein in a in a quite frankly a pissing contest with Donald Trump they are tearing this nation apart because Hillary lost the election and Donald Trump needs to step in shut this down and appoint a second special counsel I think to investigate the first special counsel I love bringing you this and I bring it to you now every day live 7:30 a.m. Eastern on my new show Declassified live tune in Monday morning until then you have a great weekend
