1
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:05,930
this is what I love sticking your head

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,990
out like a dog and enjoying the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,950
breeze the other day when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,839
Hollywood I didn't do the peanut oil

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,090
thing in the end although<font color="#CCCCCC"> he will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">making that appearance at some point on</font>

7
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,410
this la trip when I've called the videos

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,599
up when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hollywood</font>

9
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:26,029
street though holes with Dominic

10
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:27,800
remember that video the heart of

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,320
Hollywood and we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> walking past</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,279
was always one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interviewer</font>

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,990
Scientology's because there's a lot of

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,180
negative media out there and it'd be

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice to sort of give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> her more open</font>

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,930
perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it as the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> center of this</font>

17
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,270
footage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this video shows that you</font>

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,420
know I I did take a personality test

19
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,649
because I was walking down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the street</font>

20
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:47,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on said hey would you want to</font>

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,280
take personality test I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only seen the</font>

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,750
south park episode about it and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

23
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,850
spots on you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just go in there</font>

24
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,940
and you do personality test hundred and

25
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,100
fifty questions and then they get those

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,680
metal cans that test your I don't know

27
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,910
what it was testing is do you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

28
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is let's test your flow of energy or</font>

29
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,649
so

30
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,450
it's like they can judge your spirit

31
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,780
somehow right

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,790
apparently they can test it and give you

33
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,729
numerical values that equate to your

34
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,230
spiritual nature which is

35
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,950
strange thing to do yeah but anyway I

36
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,120
have my<font color="#CCCCCC"> own opinions about it please</font>

37
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,310
continue that's cool man so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went in</font>

38
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,670
and Dominic had already done<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so he</font>

39
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,080
filled me a bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he went to watch a</font>

40
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,990
video and I did it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and took about half</font>

41
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,310
an hour and they said you wanna take an

42
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,250
IQ test looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I'm cool and I</font>

43
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,350
asked him if I could video because

44
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,300
Dominic video and obviously I we didn't

45
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,540
ask about by asked about a future could

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,000
could I video the care that whatever the

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,970
device is cooled see I'm ignorant but

48
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,140
they didn't want that's happen and they

49
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,670
were being quite questioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what I'd</font>

50
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,380
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that and I totally understand</font>

51
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,910
you know don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a firm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the spot</font>

52
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:02,800
exactly so they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was taken</font>

53
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,060
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a desk by one of the people there and</font>

54
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,810
they gave me this list and basically

55
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,480
with this list and if i should put this

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,489
on my lap and that one show you you have

57
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:23,599
a basic chart and it's done on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scale</font>

58
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,860
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus 100 2 minus 100 k if you're a</font>

59
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,430
zero which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just here because it</font>

60
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,090
adorable the desirable<font color="#CCCCCC"> state is plus 100</font>

61
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,640
but what's interesting is 4 minus 100 is

62
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,340
an unacceptable skype which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i find</font>

63
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,310
completely you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> man how could</font>

64
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,260
anything be unacceptable that's like

65
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying who you are as an acceptable like</font>

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,299
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> dare you you live on this planet</font>

67
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:52,970
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just my perception so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got a</font>

68
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,940
score like plus 90 communication levels

69
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,200
by got minus literally minus<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 i I'd</font>

70
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,019
say minus ninety eight which for

71
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,260
nervousness and he late that he'd asked

72
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,610
go through each point and explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

73
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,040
each thing means and he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying like</font>

74
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,110
how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> this apply to us like I don't</font>

75
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,640
know that he kept on some questions and

76
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,260
he'd only move on when I finally

77
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,570
admitted it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just trying to get</font>

78
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,900
a taster of this but nervousness I'm a

79
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,380
nervous wreck I don't know you know you

80
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,959
can't classify this what I've learned in

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,819
psychology you can't classify

82
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:31,160
personality into traits because they all

83
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,140
overlap there's so many variable factors

84
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,440
I'm very active I'm irresponsible which

85
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,209
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> after a previous video some</font>

86
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,720
people would agree with that but you

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,459
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will make mistakes but enough of</font>

88
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,650
that critical I am

89
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,860
back of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cord it's incredible depressed</font>

90
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,000
nervous I'll do unacceptable yeah yeah

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,650
yeah man dat's how they sell you on the

92
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,420
program they're like if you if you

93
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,939
listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us yes you will be acceptable</font>

94
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,129
so my big issue with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is they didn't</font>

95
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,450
brought me over and said oh here's some

96
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,739
reading for you on the way home here's a

97
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:08,450
book about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> level that will get you</font>

98
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">started and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like look I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with my</font>

99
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,430
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me I'll come back later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

100
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">be in hollywood again so obviously that</font>

101
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,079
was my polite way of saying thanks

102
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,720
the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have is with Scientology</font>

103
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,629
it's like what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a prom with</font>

104
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:26,159
organized religion because it's business

105
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:30,000
based you know it's all small fractions

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,229
and particular religions you know

107
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,180
they're generally is good but with

108
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,219
Scientology the impression I got was it

109
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:37,919
is like the core and it is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

110
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,750
that small fraction of other religions

111
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,509
you know so it is business base but I

112
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:44,879
could be wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the big issue I have</font>

113
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,689
is if you know I'm quite strong minded i

114
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,219
was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk away but let's say</font>

115
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:52,259
someone who's maybe love someone who's

116
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,449
you know not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure where their life is</font>

117
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:55,949
going there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> one to talk to and goes</font>

118
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,780
there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's totaled that you know you</font>

119
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,569
need help your unacceptable they're

120
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:03,930
gonna fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to embrace it</font>

121
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,629
they're gonna listen and I just think

122
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:10,190
it's exploiting you know but you know

123
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,840
who am I to say that's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cuz</font>

124
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,129
there's money<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this there's money</font>

125
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:14,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved</font>

126
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,500
they're like it's one thing if they say

127
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,990
this is this is what we think this is

128
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,540
what I think

129
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,270
this is my opinion and then that was it

130
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,760
and you walked in and you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the test</font>

131
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,780
they gave your friend but then they're

132
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,430
like we want to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you this book and</font>

133
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,470
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend this money and come</font>

134
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">through this program and then you maybe</font>

135
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,900
you can raise your levels of spiritual

136
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">ness and it's like dude organized</font>

137
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,460
religion that's the thing man it's all

138
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,650
business they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recruit to make</font>

139
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,750
money so that they can recruit more to

140
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,640
make more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money to build bigger palaces</font>

141
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,000
and shinier gems and it bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thrones</font>

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,400
and it's all it's all a waste of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

143
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,620
but I think the important thing I want

144
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,680
to say is like if I ever well I oh it's

145
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,270
been quite critical here this is my son

146
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,650
personal experience I went in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there with</font>

147
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,840
an open mind and I did say to me and I

148
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to hear their side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and which I</font>

149
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,930
didn't want to you know speak about it

150
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,390
but from experience i was like thinking

151
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,830
yeah I'm gonna learn sign here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

152
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,740
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt I felt like they were trying</font>

153
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,780
to exploit me and even later that day

154
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,520
although I'm quite strong person I felt

155
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,650
I was questioning myself thinking am I

156
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,960
really a nervous wreck I was able to

157
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">overcome it but geez man it's crazy but</font>
