Kabul, Afghanistan
A woman was beaten to death and set on fire
by an angry mob of men.
Farkhunda had questioned the superstitious
practices of a local mullah.
In response, he falsely accused her of burning
the Qur’an.
Violence against women is rampant in Afghanistan,
with a man’s word often the final say.
But Farkhunda’s death has sparked national
outrage and protests from both men and women,
demanding justice.
