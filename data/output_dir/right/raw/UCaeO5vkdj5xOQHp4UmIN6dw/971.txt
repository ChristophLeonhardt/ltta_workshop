1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,697
- The White House believes
that the nuclear deal is bad.

2
00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:05,140
Barack Obama knew it was
bad, but did it anyway

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,390
and lied to the American people about it.

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,750
Trump has been saying for years

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,330
that the Iran deal is a disaster

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,870
and President Trump is right.

7
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,910
Now, as I say, none of this
means the United States

8
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,320
has to go to war.

9
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,630
The United States can do a lot of things

10
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,463
short of going to war.

11
00:00:17,463 --> 00:00:19,580
We can reimpose sanctions,
we can help facilitate

12
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,930
the use of Saudi air
space by the Israelis,

13
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,990
we can insure that Israel is defended

14
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,900
in case of retaliatory strike,

15
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,210
but that doesn't mean that we have to

16
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,450
go to active war with the Iranians.

17
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,250
We can support revolutionary
movements within Iran

18
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,160
in a stronger possible fashion if we have

19
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,320
the sanctions reinforced.

20
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,630
It's very difficult to support
people trying to topple

21
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,440
a regime when you have
a deal with the regime.

22
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,780
That's why I've always
found the Obama line

23
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,410
that it was either his deal
or war to be so foolish

24
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,550
and such a lie.

25
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,730
He's not the only one saying it of course.

26
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,140
Pat Buchanan, who really despises Israel,

27
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,190
he's been saying the same thing.

28
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,210
Here's Buchanan making that case.

29
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,050
- [Interviewer] So you
didn't watch Bibi Netanyahu's

30
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,910
evidence and believe it
today because I believed

31
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,890
every word of it.

32
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,014
I believed it.

33
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:58,420
- [Interviewee] (mumbles)
Netanyahu with due respect

34
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,488
wants the United States to
fight a war against Iran

35
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:02,321
when Israeal's...

36
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:03,536
- [Interviewer] Nobody's
talking about fighting a war.

37
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:04,747
- [Interviewee] I don't
want my country getting

38
00:01:04,747 --> 00:01:05,580
into another war.

39
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,960
- [Interviewer] I don't
want another war either.

40
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,950
- Again, this is a lie.

41
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,450
When you have people
like Pat Buchanan saying

42
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,570
that everything is inevitably
going to lead to war,

43
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,540
that's nonsense.

44
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,520
It is worth noting by the way that Israel

45
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,570
was very tepid about the
Iraq war in the first place.

46
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,090
For all the people who
keep saying that Israel

47
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,480
was the cause of the Iraq war,

48
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,520
go back and look at the evidence.

49
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,230
The Israeli government
was really not stumping

50
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,063
for the Iraq war.

51
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:25,930
They were very, very
torn about whether the

52
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,520
United States should go to war in Iraq

53
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,353
in the first place.

54
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:30,110
Now as a George W. Bush initiative,

55
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,290
I think it was the right
initiative at the time

56
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,940
based on the evidence that
he had in front of him,

57
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,762
but again this sort of Pat Buchanan,

58
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:39,120
this is a war on behalf
of the Jews routine.

59
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,417
I don't think that's
right, especially because

60
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:42,250
as Iranian influence goes in the region,

61
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,530
that threatens a lot of American interests

62
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,440
aside from Israel including Saudi Arabia,

63
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,030
including the fate of Europe,
including American troops

64
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,310
that are stationed around the world.

65
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,800
Iran developing this sort of technology

66
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,870
is extraordinarily dangerous,
especially considering

67
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,180
that Iran has such close relationships

68
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,090
with a bunch of terror groups.

69
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,990
You talk about Iran as the
greatest state terror sponsor

70
00:01:59,990 --> 00:00:00,000
on planet Earth, that
is obviously the case.
