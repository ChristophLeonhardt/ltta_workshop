66
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:18,450
too much he got a lot of kind of yeah he

67
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,099
didn't deserve what he got basically I

68
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,680
think he did<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot better job than some</font>

69
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,329
people say and he did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot better job</font>

70
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,069
there something would have done with his

71
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,829
position he<font color="#CCCCCC"> just made if he mistakes but</font>

72
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,889
he did them with conviction and yes

73
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,750
basically and other than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not much</font>

nice cake it's real nice cake so yeah as

89
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,640
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see by this little bit from here</font>

90
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,400
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much all gone now apart from</font>

91
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,460
like one piece of blue icing see good

92
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,860
there's David Tennant all right now I'm

93
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,240
reading Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury

94
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,250
which is a brilliant book I really do it

95
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,880
I recommend it 21<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause mixing brilliant</font>

96
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,440
brilliant points about like<font color="#CCCCCC"> our state of</font>

97
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,690
society in the way that we withdraw from

98
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,810
books and shorten things and condense

99
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,130
things of it's easier for us to

100
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,780
understand so that we can offend those

101
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,960
people and so yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier access</font>

102
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,000
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just easy for everyone to get</font>

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,520
low life its so-called idea of peace and

104
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,230
things and it just makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really good</font>

105
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,360
point then it's really prophetic because

106
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,350
it was written in a written so it was

107
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,669
written in 1953 will not written that

108
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:18,250
was published 9053 and it's kind of the

109
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,910
same 1984 thing is not very big but for

110
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,080
750 pages are so kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> really biggest</font>

111
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">texts so yeah you should remove that</font>

112
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,880
it's good good what to read one last

113
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing I was going to say on a more</font>

114
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,419
serious note<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess is the the work of</font>

115
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,850
the HP<font color="#CCCCCC"> alliance which is kind of it's a</font>

116
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,150
group started up by one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the members</font>

117
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a wizard-rock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them drinking my voice</font>

118
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,980
and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically saying then we are</font>

119
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,070
such a massive body<font color="#E5E5E5"> / of fans that we</font>

120
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,410
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make a change make a</font>

121
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,419
difference in something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't</font>

122
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,490
agree with which i think is perfectly

123
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,080
accurate because there are so many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

124
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,180
and the like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be distant you're</font>

125
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,100
watching this because your head was

126
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,760
finals

127
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">did you know some will do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is hire good</font>

128
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,560
fan but the HP<font color="#CCCCCC"> alliance basically saying</font>

129
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,130
things like writing letters and just

130
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,200
voicing your opinion on things just

131
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,180
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can and just to use that</font>

132
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,030
food and speech that we're also lucky to

133
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,380
have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these countries which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

134
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,540
basically why I'm able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to you</font>

135
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,270
right now and and it's really easy like

136
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,150
I mean watching like you see something

137
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,740
about writing write a letter to your

138
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,510
politician you're like oh well you know

139
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,950

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,670
never do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am I myself work to some</font>
