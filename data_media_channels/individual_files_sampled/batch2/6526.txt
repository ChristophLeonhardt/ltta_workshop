did you know that TYT now is a full audio network on top of our existing lineup this launch is gonna bring you brand-new slate of podcasts including mouthy messy mandatory with Katy Anthony and Ronit fan glass plank now that's a weekly show that discusses everything from family to really funny and fantastic women to get more info on the show and the whole TYT audio network visit t y-t-dot-com slash audio there's been a considerable amount of criticism geared toward the Trump administration following its implementation of a policy that separates children from their parents at the border even among those who seek asylum here in the United States now before we get into some of the details some of the facts related to this story I want to be absolutely clear about one thing it is being reported over and over again that the only children that gets separated from their path their families are the children who come in illegally that is not the case this is now being reported at ports of entry where individuals legally seek asylum they are not entering the country illegally don't let anyone tell you otherwise there's also been reports Vox is one of the news outlets that has reported this that Border Patrol agents will attempt to block or turn away migrants as they attempt to enter through ports of entry that is unlawful but they're doing it anyway so let me be clear so before we go any further let me explain one quick thing a lot of the Trump officials will come out and say well if you go to the port of entry as you're supposed to if you're seeking asylum then there won't be any problems if you're trying to cross the border illegally and then tell me you're seeking asylum well we're not going to buy it we're gonna prosecute you and we're going to take your kids away well half of them admit that they're taking the kids away but Ana just told you about what's happening in the ports of entry as well that's right as we know the Trump administration has been very clear about the fact that they want to clamp down not just on illegal immigration but legal immigration and that's what's happening at ports of entry now with that said we have some new numbers although they are underestimated numbers of children who have been ripped away from their family members as they come into the country seeking asylum to armen of homeland security officials said that at least 2,000 children have been separated from their parents since it began implementing this policy in late April now Raoul Reyes who is a pretty well-known immigration attorney and also a writer has said that this number is actually very low because there are ports of entry that haven't even reported their numbers yet so who knows how many children are currently in custody overall there are about 11,000 children in custody and those are children who either showed up unaccompanied or children who were taken from their parents as they were seeking asylum so the other reason they're actually higher than these reported numbers is because the reporting stopped at the end of May so did a couple of weeks of April where they started the policy all of May but June numbers are not in yet so if it's going at the same rate it would easily be 3,000 and then some plus Thunder reporting from the ports now I want to just quickly go to a video of just sessions and and this is a video that some of you might have already seen the reason why I'm showing it to you is because I want us to all be absolutely clear where this policy came from this is not a law Congress never passed a law saying that these children need to be separated from their parents this was a policy implemented by the Trump administration and Jeff sessions on multiple occasions bragged about it while giving speeches take a look if you cross the border unlawfully then we will prosecute you is that simple if you are smuggling a child then we will prosecute you and that child may be separated from you as required by law these children are not entering at ports of entry but in dangerous places in deserts and crossing our fences in escaping attempting to escape law enforcement officers we do not want to separate children from their parents we did not want adults to bring children into this country unlawfully either placing those children at risk we but we do have a policy of prosecuting adults we are pursuing a tolerance prosecution policy at the border having children does not give you immunity from arrest and prosecution bringing children with you doesn't guarantee you won't get prosecuted Kenneth our policies that can result in short-term separation of families is not unusual or unjustified we cannot and will not encourage people to bring their children or other children to the country unlawfully by giving them immunity in the process why wouldn't you bring children with you if you know you would be released and not prosecuted so there's zero tolerance policy has now detained so many children that the facilities that already existed were overcrowded beyond capacity and so now there are ten cities popping up in Tornillo Texas that is the tenth city that we found out about over the weekend and there are literally children being detained in these makeshift detention facilities because of what the Trump administration is doing yeah please they're not ten cities they're not cages for the cages they're now chain-link fences I believe right some of the propaganda being used by Fox News and some of other Republicans the kids are prisoners plain and simple there's cops everywhere they're law enforcement I should say everywhere they're not allowed to leave here are images that were released by our federal government these are not you know lovely environments where kids are thriving I mean they're sleeping with these you know foil blankets this is not a great situation it's it's clear and I think the administration is realizing that this policy might actually backfire on them politically but those things that look like cages are not cages okay just so you know and if you notice Jeff Sessions said in the middle there it's also we're not going to let you smuggle any children look if they're smuggling in children that aren't theirs by all means everybody in the country agrees arrest them and imprison them for a long time after a trial and make sure you get those kids away from them but that's not what's happening here what's happening is it is their kids now all of a sudden what it like are you pretending that all of those families those thousands of families that have come with their kids they're not actually their kids they all just just grabbed a random child I mean dad that's the list of preposterous excuses that they have used right now I do want to also share a photo that went viral over the weekend featuring a 2 year old Honduran girl who's crying she's crying because her mother is being searched by agents and she's about to be detained the little girl later ended up in a detention facility and there have been counselors speaking out about what's going on because one of the more traumatic elements of all of this is that no one's allowed to console the kids you're not allowed to hug them you're not allowed to touch them and I understand the reasoning behind that but imagine being a two-year-old child seeing your mother get arrested by agents and then you're sent to some strange place where you're crying and you're just kind of left alone they can't really do anything about it some of your parents are others of course are not in but you have I hope human empathy but for the parents who've had a two-year-old who had it's not at night when they're trying to go to sleep or whatever but they got hurt or they're genuinely concerned Lea for a second they feel like they lost you in a mall or something right and then there's this panic cry imagine that no one ever comforts them you they see you being taken away and they start crying more and more hysterically and not only can you not help them but no one is allowed to help them no one's allowed to touch them and again Ana says it's true we put ourselves in a no-win situation if you got guys or people that are handling the kids that's problematic you got two year olds four year olds etc and their their hearts broken they don't know law they don't know the the judicial system and they don't know that their parents are coming back they don't know anything right and no one is allowed to console them if that's not heartbreaking there's something wrong with you and an unfortunately that describes a huge part of this administration conservatives who are supportive of what's going on right now have absolutely no room to talk about family values ever again ever again they have no room to talk about how much they care about babies and how women should be forced to bring their pregnancies to term because they're pro-life no you're not no you're not it's the most disingenuous thing in the country at the moment this whole notion of Family Values because the very party that claims they're in favor of Family Values also supports this policy of ripping children away from their family members as their family members seek asylum because of violence in their own countries I mean it's just it's crazy so ProPublica which is a fantastic journalistic organization just released audio of a Border Patrol agent talking to a crying child and it gives you a sense of what it's like for these kids now this is a six-year-old child who actually memorized her aunt's phone number her mother made her memorize it in case they got separated and she's begging the Border Patrol agent to let her go with her on listen when I became a woman okay I'm sorry they after you look you've heard bratty kids cry cuz they didn't get a toy or something and then you've heard kids with a real anguish whether they hurt themselves or they felt somehow you know scared scared yeah spurn whatever it might be and for our Border Patrol agents to say uh a little Orchestra here now we need a conductor and but this is what it does this is what authoritarian government does it forces people to do monstrous things so we have now given orders and they must follow those orders to take the kids and don't care about their crying don't help them don't consoled them don't listen to them that they want family members like their aunt no just put them into cages call it a different name and you're done with it so they are following those orders and that's the country we
