a woman threw her own feces outside of a window during a date and after that feces got stuck somehow near the windowsill she tried to get it out and then got stuck in said windowsill which made it the worst date of all time now this story is amazing and I don't know how it made it to the headlines I don't know how BBC got this story but it is one of my favorite stories ever it starts with a tinder date okay this couple gets together they have dinner they're having a good time right and then they decide let's go back to the apartment have some wine have some more fun right Tony now in the middle of this wine drinking and fun having the woman in question realizes that she needs to use the potty and so she goes to the bathroom does number two and panics when she realizes that the toilets not flushing not her fault that seems to be the guy's fault you got to maintain your toilets now you can't leave you know feces in the toilet like that's embarrassing it's a first date so she decides to somehow reach in grab it and try to throw it out the window because that is less embarrassing no but like I don't know what what do you do what do you do like leave it there no you can you because it's the least bad option okay I know where I know we're not voting for lesser of two evils but but you can't scoop it out you just got to say hey dude your toilet doesn't work that's a disaster but anyways well at least we know that she has a healthy diet cuz that was a solid poop all right what if it wasn't solid then what is she gonna do she has no options then okay so she pulls she throws it out the window it somehow gets stuck and then she panics because it's easy to see it where it got stuck and so she felt like she needed to be honest with the man that she was on a date with his name is Liam Smith so she goes it back into the room and she's like yo I threw my poop out the window it's stuck yo we need British pooped in your bathroom did I reach this coated up and I figured out who number two works for what a controversy so so then they get together and try to figure out how they can retrieve the poo that has now been stuck near the window all right now let me give you the details as written by the New York Daily News the window the woman used opened into a gap that was separated by another window which is where the poop was stuck Smith said he left the bathroom to get a hammer to smash the window but his date decided to try to climb through and got trapped so at this point you know Liam Smith knows what's going on he's like okay we need to yes we need to retrieve the poo let me go get a hammer and break the window and so as he was doing that she's like no I'm taking matters into my own hands which apparently is a really bad idea for her to ever do go through and then she gets stuck and at that point they gotta call the authorities so they call the authorities and you know nightmare they luckily rescued her we have pictures of the incident graphics 26 and 27 there's the woman in question oh my god as if it wasn't bad enough like I'm stuck is and I'm right next to a poop okay Sonia oh my god is that her feet up in the ceiling how did she do that I don't know I just cannot understand how this story could get any more disastrous okay here's the thing you threw the poo out the window cuz you didn't want to be embarrassed in front of a man that you're on a date with but then you proceeded to get embarrassed with several men on the scene like the guys in that picture oh it's terrible it's heartbreaking yeah okay so this whole incident destroyed his window and he's a struggling postgraduate student and he's like I need money to fix this window so what he did was he started like a crowdfunding page and he was hoping to get $300 he ended up getting like $1,200 I'm sorry euros let me be specific euro so he got euros he and his date got together and donated what they didn't need to charity so they're great and guess what he really liked her so they're going out on another hey you better fix that doily son there's so many amazing parts of this story and the twist at the end is even better it's like who gives them money for it because you know why cuz we're we're amused by the story and we're good people at heart and with all the terrible things that have it on there and now there's still wonderful things and people look at that and go kind of feel bad for about the poo controversy what can we do for you 1200 euros which say that mainly give to charity if they get married out of this it was gonna be one hell of a story to tell the kids I can't believe she reached for her poo and threw it out the window that is amazing this is my favorite story of the year well I guess we now know what happens when the poo hits the fan help us build independent media together TYT Network comm /join
