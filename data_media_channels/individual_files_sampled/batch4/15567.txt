reports suggest that the required 48 letters to out Teresa may have now been submitted to the 1922 committee an unnamed source has told Paul War of the Huffington Post that the forty eight letters required to trigger a vote of confidence in Teresa may have now been sent Wahl wrote on Twitter today's war zone is in your inbox folks one source tells me the forty eight letters threshold needed for a vote of confidence in Teresa May has been passed only sir Graham Brady knows for sure now honestly I knew this was possible but I didn't think that actually any Tory MP would want to be one of the final people responsible for handing in those letters which crossed that threshold and resulted in mrs. may potentially being removed from her role I didn't think anyone would actually do it we known for a while that we were very very close to the threshold but Wow it seems to potentially have happened an anonymous Tory MP also told the son that he and two of his colleagues would be sending in letters yesterday the 22nd of October so that's three and we knew at the beginning of the week that about four were required to hit the 48 threshold so I wonder who handed in that final one that very last letter that was required to tip it past 48 that was either an amazing time an amazing thing to do a thrilling thing to do or deeply terrifying it's probably a combination of both isn't it imagine being that person responsible for a no-confidence vote or a confidence vote in Teresa may the prime minister by the way knew this was coming two days ago she wrote for the son that she vowed to do Bragg's it her way and implement her brexit plan even if it meant losing her job and as a politician shouldn't she have been aware and mindful of the fact that if you risk losing your job and you're a politician elected by the people it probably means you're not doing what the people want you to do is that simple Teresa may she should have known that and she claims to be making the right choices not the easy ones but if the whole country is against her shouldn't that tell Teresa may that she's doing something wrong now Teresa should expect roughly half the country to disagree with what she's doing that's what happened in 2016 that's the result of the referendum half the country once it breaks it half the country didn't but if the whole country is against you Teresa that might imply you've annoyed a lot more people than you should have done more than half the country don't write your brags it deal so either step down or change their plan come on so the next step well the 1922 committee the chairman of it has got to check the number of letters and I guess he'll go from there we've read before that the aim is actually by the breaks it is the aim is to provide more than 48 letters because they want to show the prime minister but it's not a small minority in the party that don't believe in her leadership but whether more people come forward now that that threshold is already crossed and they won't be responsible for being the final letter whether more people come forward I don't know I guess only time will tell but what we do know is Teresa may could be ousted as Prime Minister as soon as the end of the week if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team be sure to download our new app from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store you
