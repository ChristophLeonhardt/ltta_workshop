1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,320
Justice Anthony Kennedy is
leaving the Supreme Court.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,030
He’d been a key
vote in decisions

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,950
upholding abortion rights.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,480
But President Trump
has said he

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,730
wants to appoint
a pro-life judge.

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,330
“Under my administration

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,479
we will always defend
the right to life."

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,850
Here’s what three
frontrunners have already

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,060
said about abortion, and the
landmark abortion rights case

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,490
Roe v. Wade.

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,780
Judge Amy Coney Barrett
has been championed

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,570
by Christian conservatives.

13
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,990
At a nomination hearing

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,150
for a federal appellate
court last year,

15
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,570
Democrats asked her how
her Catholic faith

16
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,680
may factor into her
decision making.

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,610
“You have a long
history of believing

18
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,160
that your religious
beliefs should prevail.

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,640
Well, how do you evaluate
the precedents — plural —

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,620
with respect to Roe?”

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,850
“The Supreme Court 
precedents?”

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,590
“Yes.”

23
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,700
“It’s not open to me, 
or up to me,

24
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,240
and I would have 
no interest in,

25
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,390
as a court of
appeals judge,

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,500
challenging that precedent.
It would bind.”

27
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,800
In a 2016 discussion,

28
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,450
she said she could
envision the scope

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,010
of abortion rights changing.

30
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,209
“I don’t think
the core case —

31
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,939
that Roe’s core holding
that, you know, women

32
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,030
have a right 
to an abortion —

33
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,210
I don’t think 
that would change.

34
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,820
But I think the question
of whether people

35
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
can get very
late-term abortions,

36
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,920
you know, how many restrictions
can be put on clinics,

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,090
I think that would change.

38
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,680
Next is Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,470
Before he became a
federal appellate court judge,

40
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,090
he helped the
Bush administration fill

41
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,590
the federal courts with
conservative judges.

42
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,470
But he skirted the
issue of where they

43
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,120
stood on 
reproductive rights.

44
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,220
“The abortion issue
was put forward

45
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,540
by the Bush administration,
as the sole litmus test.

46
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,510
Let me ask you this:

47
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:48,440
Could you identify
five pro-choice judges —”

48
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,030
“I —”

49
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,240
“that the White House
sent to the Hill?”

50
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,880
“I don’t know
whether the nominees

51
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,640
are pro-choice or
pro-life unless —”

52
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,950
“Four, three, two, one?”

53
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,170
“Senator, I’m sure 
there are many.

54
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,520
I don’t know what someone’s who –
I don’t know and we don't ask

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,150
what someone’s 
position on issues

56
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,790
like that is.”

57
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,860
And finally, there’s
Judge Raymond Kethledge.

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,530
He hasn’t talked publicly
about Roe v. Wade.,

59
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,500
but he has spoken about
the nature of

60
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,680
Supreme Court precedent.

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,980
“First and foremost, I’d follow
Supreme Court precedent.

62
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,830
The other thing I would
say is that, again,

63
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,670
I would make sure that
the values that I would

64
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,600
be enforcing if I were a
judge are not just my values,

65
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,690
that I am not striking
something down simply

66
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,290
because I don’t like it.”

67
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,650
President Trump said he will
announce a Supreme Court nominee

68
00:02:41,650 --> 00:00:00,000
in the coming days.
