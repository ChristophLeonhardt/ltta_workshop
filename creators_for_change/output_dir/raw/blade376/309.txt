off for a friend's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20th was at the</font>

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,140
cinema last night went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the hills</font>

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,950
of iced<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea and the pondering essence of</font>

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">a issue came to my mind again if that</font>

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,639
makes sense I don't know if it does who

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,800
cares whenever I'm in a cinema all over

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,390
the years he gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and you know</font>

10
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,710
have all the refreshments nice

11
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,470
refreshments you always get well I do

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,050
the big one we think it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> last the</font>

13
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,000
whole film<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consumed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something as</font>

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,640
big as this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get pepsi likes by the way</font>

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,830
you find that by the end of the film

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,190
maybe halfway through you really need to

17
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,309
go you know it won't stay in the whole

18
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,340
time but the film's get into a climax or

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,390
its get into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good bit all you</font>

20
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,070
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss a bit and you're just holding</font>

21
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,469
on and on and it's just agonizing and

22
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,469
then in the end you just have to go my

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,730
mum was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just asked me if I wanted a</font>

24
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,710
sandwich lesser and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was rubbish</font>

25
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">smells like my i'm using it for my blog</font>

26
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,789

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,979
make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand people I need everyone to</font>

33
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,810
contribute to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

34
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">could benefit mankind in the cinematic</font>

35
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,479
sense and therefore this video will be

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,300
the start of the restroom<font color="#CCCCCC"> roar</font>

37
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,240
what's the miles<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what i want</font>

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,070
everyone to do is free comment or

39
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,370
through video post video response Ayers

40
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,520
is to tell me a film that's out now out

41
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,150
recently or maybe an old one and tell us

42
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,490
a point in the film which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

43
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,650
place to go to the restroom<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

44
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it will just help people out but</font>

45
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really hard I mean this takes</font>

46
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,430
extreme professionalism and it's a big

47
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,110
responsibility because you don't want to

48
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,730
give spoilers away you know you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

49
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,590
sort of say the roughly the right bit be

50
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,570
it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spoil it and at the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

51
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,000
you know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what bit</font>

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,440
song is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to miss if they take your</font>

53
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,270
advice so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take the hills</font>

54
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,370
advised to and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to get you</font>

55
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,860
know say it the best placed so you have

56
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,479
a restroom break if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are watching the</font>

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,310
film and you really need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go now of</font>

58
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">course people some people go are the</font>

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,820
best scenes near the beginning not

60
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,740
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know usually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

61
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,270
still drinking through this so you've

62
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">got to think about halfway through the</font>

63
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,880
film to the end for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hill is advised</font>

64
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say is the part in which they</font>

65
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,380
enter a cave and they start stepping

66
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,320
into water as soon as that happens goes

67
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,540
that restroom and get back as quick as

68
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,000
you can i'd say maybe once two<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font>

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,040
three minutes maybe if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushing it</font>

70
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,560
four minutes yeah let you off to

71
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760

72
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,130
restroom break people so take a film and

73
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,530
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it even if you have like if</font>

74
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,150
you've even timed it in the salon for

75
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,430
right how many minutes is this you know

76
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,900
