really got under my skin is from my senator here in the state of California she was the Attorney General here she's a garbage senator she was a garbage Attorney General and she's probably gonna be a garbage presidential candidate she's obviously looking toward running it in 2020 and there's always been this very weird relationship between the left and kids when it comes to politics Hillary Clinton made her bones on this book it takes a village all about how it really took all of us to define how we were going to raise particular children they weren't your children they were the villages children and then you see people on the Left who don't care about unborn children suggesting that they're the only ones who care about children so Kamala Harris tweets this out yesterday she tweeted out children are our nation's future we must listen to them about what they care about and give them a voice in our government so again weird that she doesn't care about them up until the point where they're born yeah up until that point you can kill them at will and in fact if you stand in the way of somebody killing them well that means you're a bad person but also this notion that children are the nation's future and so we have to listen to them about what they care about and give them a voice in our government no so one of the big problems in Western civilization has been this this weird notion that's really cropped up since Rousseau in the early in the early 19th century that children are worth listening to okay children are worth taking seriously the questions are worth answering I treat my three-year-old with great seriousness when she asked me a question I tried to give her the most actual answer that I can provide but if she were to give me world advice I would say you're three sit down and eat your crackers okay it's ridiculous for anyone to suggest that children are what should be defining voice in government is the first sentence is that children our nation's future that's true they are not our present okay they are not our nation's present it is your job as an adult to help civilize children have you ever met a child I wonder if people on the Left have met a child like really met a child children are the worst people on earth okay they're wonderful and they are also the worst people on earth they have no prefrontal cortex development they don't have the capacity for inhibition that means that your child does stuff what if an adult did it you would immediately have them carted off to jail I got a routine basis children smack each other okay if you're an adult you just walked up to people and smack them for no reason would go to jail for that right children routinely take other people's property and break it children scream at you okay children are little nutjobs and they're they're awesome they're wonderful but that's also because you know they're going to develop beyond that if they're 20 and still acting like they're three that means they're garbage human being the whole point of civilization is to civilize children your job as a parent is to civilize children and to make them better people because children are not instinctively good Rousseau wrote this jean-jacques Rousseau wrote this book called a meal which was it was a novel about a child who's basically left free in the state of nature Rousseau's whole theory is that in a state of nature man is inherently good and then the state puts us on one change right man is free and everywhere he is in Chains this is Russo's theory and so what he says in a meal is basically if you just let a child laundry around in nature and that child would become a noble savage that child would be a beautiful wonderful person capable of navigating the vicissitudes of life absolute nonsense number one if you live a three-year-old alone nature that'll be dead in two days number two if you leave a ten-year-old alone in nature the kid will turn into something from more to the fly is killing animals and other children the idea that people are born civilized is just stupid that's the whole point of civilization it's what religion is based on religion is based on the notion that you as an adult have to civilize it and raise your children and you have to acclimate them to acting morally it's not something that is inborn it's not something that is inbred okay the fact is that there's a concept in in Jewish law it's called Teno janeshia okay it means literally a baby that was found so there are certain basic rules in Judaism that you're not supposed to violate and even if you're not Jewish you're not supposed to violate these rules and these are simple ones like don't murder people don't commit idolatry right these are certain basic rules for everyone if you want to get into heaven according to Judaism you don't have to be Jewish but you do have to fulfill what they call the seven mitzvot of Nowak it's a full of seven commandments of Noah right because Noah existed before the Torah had been given these are Commandments that you're supposed to be able to suss out from the surrounding universe but if you don't actually do a lot of the let's say there's a kid who's born Jewish right born to a Jewish family and left in the middle of nowhere and doesn't fulfill any of the 613 mitzvot than any of the 613 commandments that's where this concept of T notion ish Bach comes in we don't blame that person because that kid was basically like a kid who was found the woods raised Mowgli so you don't expect Mowgli to be civilized and in fact there was that you remember a few years ago there's this story about a little girl who was basically left alone for years and years and years they found her when she was like 12 years old and she acted like an animal what else would you expect her to do she was she was growing up in a place that was basically surrounded by animals how you raise your children matters this idea that children are going to that they have some sort of god-given innocence and wisdom that is that is something that we should listen to know they have a god-given wonder about the world that is amazing to behold and lovely and it reminds you how beautiful life is because when you view the world through a child's eyes it reminds you that things around you are really cool and really interesting but kids moral notions are usually really really stupid because kids are little immoral cretins okay they only get smart later again their brains are not developed to the point where they can actually have smart moral thoughts okay this is why even teenagers are not really developed to the point where they have smart moral thoughts the the reason the teenagers act like idiots all the time is because their amygdala which is their motion sensor in their brain is overdeveloped and their prefrontal cortex which is the inhibition sensor is underdeveloped so that's why that's why teenagers do stupid stuff so when she says we have to give children a voice in our government what you want three-year-olds to vote but what what really underlies this perception what really underlies this perception the left doesn't really believe that children are to be making their own decisions the left believes that they ought to be making decisions for your children and the left doesn't believe that children are to be making decisions for society they believe that they ought to be making decisions for your children and the only reason that your children are growing up in the way they are is because of you you are the problem if they were allowed to raise your children and everything would be fine now they can't just say that if you're if you're on the hard left you can't just say this you can't just say listen I think I'm gonna do a better job raising your kid than you will you can't say that because number one it's not true and number two it makes you a jackass have you come to me and you say I'm gonna raise your kid better than you well then I would say to you you can go take a hike son if you try to take my kid from me I'd meet at the front door with a shotgun so what is the left you instead what instead they do is they say children are beautiful innocent little creatures but fully capable of making their own decisions and if you inhibit the decision-making process of a three-year-old then you are the villain we step in to protect the independence of the three-year-old right we're basically the American government fighting the British we're stepping in to protect the citizen the citizen is the three-year-old we have to protect that three-year-old from you the oppressive evil parents who's putting your notions about God and heaven and hell on kids how dare you do all of these things it's because of you their kid is growing up with all of these problems if your kid were just allowed to make their own decisions just like a meal and everything would be fine and it's our job to step in and make sure the kids can make their own decisions that's how you end up with idiocy 'he's like this story from Rockland Academy schools which is a Sacramento area charter school this is a pobla of daily wire reporting a kindergarten teacher at Rockland Academy schools the Sacramento area charter school recently held a transition ceremony to celebrate what she believed was the transgenderism of a five-year-old boy in her class who fancies himself a girl and she did it without obtaining consent from or even notifying parents facing legal trouble from parents rightly outraged over having their children exposed to transgenderism without their knowledge Rockland Academy schools maintains they had no obligation to inform the parents since California laws require consent only in matters of sex education so let me get this straight it's not sex education when you decide to tell a five-year-old boy that it can be a five-year-old girl the lesson they say had to do with gender identity which the school claims falls under tolerance and diversity curricula the students who took part in the ceremony were reportedly left shaken and disturbed yes again somebody if somebody did this to my kid if somebody lives seriously if somebody did this to my kid they would be in physical danger from me like that if you did this to my kid if you decided to take my parenting power away from my child from me and and pretend that you are going to raise my child as the opposite sex and thereby stamp their their psyche with gender confusion and put the perimeter of societal approval on that gender confusion you're doing something truly evil and jonathan keller is a representative for california family group who's a group involved in counseling some of the kids and said parents only learned of the ceremony from their kids which began with a lesson on transgenderism that involved two books i am jazz and the red cran that were both about the subject I am jazz of course is about that that kid who's on reality TV who quote from the time she was two years old knew that she had a girl's brain in a boy's body again this is biologically incorrect and it's asinine okay there is no such thing as a girl's brain in a boy's body again there be good and that's true because you don't actually have evidence of what a girl's brain looks like it's so funny the feminists who say there is no difference between a girl's brain and a boys brain suddenly they go completely silent when you say it's a girl's brain in a boy's body you have to show me the actual parts of the brain that operate more like the girls than a boys and then we can decide whether or not this is true it is possible that there are people who have brain development that is more similar to a girl than a boy those would presumably be genetically intersex people but the idea that any boy is capable of having a girl's brain his body if he thinks it so not real but again this is the left saying that parents can't have a say in their own child's future because we're defending the children don't you understand we're defending their innocence do you understand that by suggesting that a child makes their own decision you are ripping away their innocent their innocence the hallmark of adulthood is the capacity to make your own decision the hallmark of childhood is to be free not to make your own decisions on matters of weighty import that's what parents are for it's your job to have fun it's your parents job to take care of you and it's your job to learn and that's what being a child is all about but the left has reverses polarity now adults never have to take responsibility for their decisions but children are to be left alone to make their own decisions and if you intervene as a parent you're the bad guy before I go any further here and there's another story I want to talk about that has some relevance here first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at USC CA so I'm gonna tell you the story of a guy named buddy but he's an army vet and spends his life defending his country and his fellow man but when buddy needed help the screwed up legal system turned on him and threw him in jail for defending his family when his daughter's angry ex-boyfriend showed up on buddy's doorstep with a gang of thugs he protected his family but when the cops showed up they arrested him that's when buddy called us CCA and because he knew that his membership gave him exclusive access to a network of pro-second amendment attorneys upfront funding for bail and legal fees and the peace of mind that someone was on his side he was okay the u.s. CCA got buddy back to his daughter back to his wife and his life and they can do the exact same thing for you make sure that you are covered defend my family now.com defend my family now calm in case you ever have to fire a gun I promise you the police are going to do something about it and you need to be protected for that go to defend my family now come today for more truth stories and to discover how you can win a brand-new gun they also give away guns to some people who register so you have a chance to win one if you go to defend my family now calm again let's defend my family now calm education training you have a chance to win a firearm and protection in case you actually have to fire one in a self-defense situation defend my family now calm go and check it out USC CA does wonderful work and you should go give them a look okay so in this ceremony getting back to the ceremony in this kindergarten class LifeSite News described it this way after the teacher introduced the five year old students of the class as a boy he then went into the bathroom and emerged too dressed as a girl the teacher then reintroduced her to the children explaining that she was now a girl who know how to girls name and was to be called that from now on according to Keller who's this guy from the family group he said kids were left really deeply emotionally bothered and traumatized there were several of the little girls that went to their parents who were crying saying mommy or daddy am I going to turn into a boy this is evil it's evil okay teachers who are teaching entire classrooms of small children that they can magically transform into members of the opposite sex okay it's so funny these people will say that if you teach people about religion that that's teaching the myth that if you teach them about Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny that that's myth okay this is significantly more mythical because it runs absolutely counter to biology and the idea that kids are not malleable when it comes to sexual orientation they're not malleable when it comes to gender identity there's no science that demonstrates that at all none okay there there may be genetic predispositions for transgenderism there may be there may be genetic predispositions on sexual orientation but to suggest that environment plays no part is to ignore every single piece of available data ever like all of it not some of it all of it and yet this is what they say because there's an agenda right the agenda is to make it clear to children that gender identity is fluid this is one of the things the left wants to do is tear down the basic building blocks of Western civilization in order to build something anew if we're all widgets if we're all just claymation figures and their little in their little parable of life then they get to more of us however we want they get to mold us and morph us however they want and that means taking over our children and using them against us and using them against our standards of right and wrong so the left which will say that they have the our to go in and tell your five-year-old child that he may be a girl right this is the same left that says that if a teacher preys on the 50-yard line that that teacher ought to be fired there's the case out of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals today it's an amazing case ok Bremerton School District is a is a school district in Washington State and the assistant football coach and one of their high schools a guy named Joseph Kennedy prayed at the 50-yard line after football games and before them as well students frequently joined him he would also give them religiously oriented motivational speeches the school district tried to punish him for doing this he settled for praying alone after games but then he began praying at the 50-yard line before everyone gone home so instead of waiting til everyone leave left and then praying at the 50-yard line he would go over right after the game a game is over he goes over he prays at the 50-yard line and surprise surprise a lot of the kids started joining him and people started coming down out of the stands to join him praying on the 50-yard line end of the world how dare he public school teacher praying by himself on the 50-yard line people joining him voluntarily must be fired so the school district fired him they suspended him and then they allowed his contract to expire so Kennedy sued he suggested religious discrimination under the First Amendment the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found the school district had every right to dismiss Kennedy so there were two legal questions here first legal question was was he a public employee second was as a public employee did he violate his job description as a public employee by doing this so there are two separate legal questions the court said when Kennedy kneeled and prayed on the 50-yard line immediately after games well in view of students and parents he spoke as a public employee not as a private citizen and his speech therefore was constitutionally unprotected the case they make in favor of this idea is one he's still wearing all of his high school gear second if you were just a citizen you couldn't walk out to the middle of the 50-yard line right you have to be a member of the high school staff in order to do this so I think that this is actually legally arguable is he doing this as a private citizen or is he doing this on school grounds on school time and therefore he's doing it as a public employee it's a little bit it's a little bit more confusing than that because the fact is that if you're at school I'm fine with a public school teacher and then I decided to dive in medical which is the second Jewish prayer of the day and I went in a broom closet somewhere and prayed prayed minica that doesn't mean that I would necessarily be acting as a public school employee clearly I'm a temp two separate and separate myself the court found he was acting however in his auspices as a public school in employee but that isn't really the worst part the worst part is that the court then said what he did violated his job description okay praying at the 50-yard line doing a voluntary prayer that people decide to join violates his job description now let me explain what his job description was okay Kennedy's job included becoming quote a coach mentor and role model for the student athletes it included in explicit job requirements to attempt to create both good athletes and good human beings because directly in his job description Kennedy's postgame prayers originally lasted a grand total of 30 seconds there were a brief quiet prayer of thanksgiving for player safety sportsmanship and spirited competition over time they morphed into motivational speeches given to students of both teams even people on the other team would come over because they enjoyed what he was saying about sportsmanship in the games students voluntarily wanted to hear him the district suggested these activities violated school board policy that said that quote staff shall neither encourage nor discourage a student from engaging in non-disruptive oral or silent prayer or any other form of devotional activity okay this didn't violate that the guy literally went out to the 50-yard line note down and prayed that's it he didn't say people have to show up he didn't force anybody he didn't tell people that if they showed up and they didn't show up then they would be kicked off the team or suspended the school board openly acknowledged that Kennedy didn't force anyone to pray with him but the school board insisted that Kennedy not allows students to pray with him at all that he should forcibly turn them away if he goes to the 50-yard line and kneels down and he starts to pray and a bunch of students crowd around him that this is some sort of evil that he's violated his public school duties and he should tell them forcibly get out of here you're not allowed to be here they said any activity had to be quote physically separate from any student activity and students may not be allowed to join such an activity so what actually started all of this what actually started all of this is of course he did this 50-yard prayer thing and the Satanists being good Satanists devotees of Satan suggested they wanted their own right to pray on the field because obviously there's no difference between Satanists praying on the field and people of judeo-christian values praying on the field not all religions are created equal in quality if you're gonna bring up a child in the Church of Satan I don't think that child ends up exactly the same as if you bring the average child is if you bring up a child in the in the judeo-christian value system if it were then Satanism would have created the greatest civilization in the history of mankind it didn't okay the so the district responded by telling Kennedy he had to pray only when the stadium was empty he disobeyed and he started praying right after the game is because he said listen it doesn't make any sense for me to pray an hour after the game on the 50-yard line the game just ended I want to thank God for a good game and for everyone staying safe now it's a good time to do it so the court found in favor of the district so as I say first they found that he was a public employee they said the speech at issue is directly at least in parts of the students and the surrounding spectators it is not solely speech directed to God so this is really dicey territory the court is getting into right now they're saying that his prayer was directed as a public school employee at others hey I wear a yarmulke I wear it around it's a public sign of my faith millions and millions and millions of Americans including many people on the Left wear crosses around their neck that is a public proclamation of faith is that them privately saying I believe in Jesus if you are the cross or I believe in the Jewish God if you view our yarmulke or is that me preaching to you do you feel preached to every time I wear my yarmulke because if you do I would suggest that maybe you need to get a life if you feel preached to because you don't like what I wear on my head then this is because you are a loser okay and if you feel preached to because a high school coach by himself goes to the 50-yard line and prays then you are a doofus and a loser and you need to get a life but obviously that's not the priority here the court said by kneeling and praying on the 50-yard line immediately after games Kennedy was fulfilling his professional responsibility to communicate demonstrative ly to students and spectators yet he took advantage of his position to press his particular views upon the impressionable and captive minds before him so they're saying okay so his viewpoint means something because he was acting as an employee that brings us to the second question and the second question is did that violate his job which is to create better human beings and better students we'll get to that in one second first I want to say thank you to a new sponsor the tides of history hey go to the Apple podcast app or wherever you listen to podcast iTunes SoundCloud Google tides of history it's a brand new podcast it's really great I've listened to a few episodes of it it asks you why are there states country's taxes Wars and it traces the history of all of the institutions under which we currently live all the way back to the 13th and 14th centuries he takes on time periods from the fall of Rome and the rise of the early modern Empire he talks about the roots of the modern world how did capitalism start how did global trade start right all the questions all of the main concepts that underlie shows like mine begin with shows like tides of history what are the roots of all the things that we discuss here on the show what are the roots of the American Founding tradition what are the roots of the left all of these things can be found hundreds and hundreds of years ago history is not just a blank slate every time somebody is born history pre-exists you and it has an impact on you and it has an impact on the civilization in which you live that's what tides of history is there to teach those could be really dry stuff it isn't it's really entertaining it's a really good listen it all talks about the period of time during the Renaissance just before the Enlightenment which is a really kind of under-examined period of history well I like to look at enlightenment philosophers we all like to look at at the some people like to look at the Dark Ages the so-called Dark Ages of the Roman Empire but the period of time that's most ignored is the Renaissance and that really was the birthplace of modern civilization go listen to the first episode of tides of history on Apple podcast or wherever you listen to podcast or Google tides of history to find the podcast today it really is an excellent podcast I highly recommend it so go check it out ok so back to this back to this story so this coach Kennedy kneels on the 50-yard line and the court has decided that he's a public employee which as I say is main that may be arguable and he's a public employee was he a public employee who was acting under private auspices or was he a public employee who was doing basically preaching and so here's what the courts and even if he was doing preaching was it violating his job description like if I if I go into a classroom and I say listen the judeo-christian value system is the best value system and it generates better human beings is that preaching or is that teaching now I would suggest that living in Western civilization that is based on judeo-christian tradition that would actually be teaching not preaching I'm not saying you have to believe in the Bible I'm not saying you have to believe that God gave the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai I am saying that those beliefs were the foundation stone of Western civilization which is true ok so judge Millan G Smith wrote this in concurrence and this is the crux of the matter he writes the context bolster the perception that the district was endorsing religion here it is okay here's the key point irrespective of the district's views on that matter a reasonable observer would conclude in light of the history and context surrounding Kennedy's conduct that the district in actuality favors religion and prefers Christianity in particular hey listen teachers don't have the absolute right to do and say as what they want as employees of school districts did they have the right to fire this guy maybe but to suggest they have an obligation to fire him that's what the court is now saying not just that they have the right but they had the obligation because no public school teacher can pray on the 50-yard line without imposing his religious views on others let's make something absolutely clear that is an imposition of a religious view on others that ruling is an imposition of a secular religious view on others it is the imposition of the idea that religion must be disfavored but the First Amendment must be applied in Reverse that freedom of religion is not to be protected that instead we have to disestablish forcibly disestablished anybody's religious belief no matter whether they're forcing it on anybody or not again this isn't even the equivalent of the guy going into the classroom and preaching this is the equivalent of him doing something people are free to show up or not show up it's voluntary for the left the presence of religion itself is insulting so how does this tie in with the broader argument about children here's what the left is seeking to do they're seeking to say that a that a five-year-old can be taught by their teacher without parental permission that he is a she but a fifteen-year-old cannot have the option of praying at the 50-yard line with a coach that's an agenda folks okay that's not about protecting the innocence of children it's about depriving them of certain types of choice that they don't like and giving them types of choice that they do like when I say types of choice I mean screwing them up permanently in many cases because it is important to promulgate a leftist view of social politics that's scary stuff and you know that's that's got to be fought at every turn bye-bye good good will people who are parents okay I'm a parent you try to do this to my kid you try to do this to my kid you wonder why people are taking their kid out of public school and sending them to private school you wonder why people are retreating from the public square you wonder why the fever-pitch of politics is so high right now it's because of garbage like this people feel that their children are being threatened by outsiders who think they how to raise their children better than I do you don't even know my kids names you don't know their birthdays you don't know a damn thing about them you don't care about them there's a point that Phil Gramm made at one point there was some some lefty that he was he was interviewing on a Senate committee and and the senator was questioning the the leftist and the left I said I care about your children as much as you do and Phil Gramm said what are their names that's exactly right parents have the ability to raise their children and not only the ability the duty you have the duty to raise your child you have the duty to raise your child under a rubric of values that makes them a better human being that is your charge in this life for our society to ignore that and fight actively against it is a true evil and what we're looking at right now is a serious battle against truth and decency just horrifying okay so in other news and the more political front there's a new poll out president Trump has been spending the last few days ripping on Senate Republicans he went on Twitter this morning again ripped on Senator McConnell ripped on bob corker the senator from Tennessee and I understand him ripping on McConnell he doesn't feel like McConnell's doing the job ripping on bob corker it's kind of weird since he actually interviewed bob corker for his Secretary of State it seems more like Trump is angry at these people than like he is actually interested in changing their behavior except as regards to him this is a distinction you know if you're going to attack senators the purpose of attacking a senator presumably is to move him on the issues and can leverage senators but I think that right now Trump is sort of lashing out at senators because he doesn't like them personally so you know at the end that rally on Tuesday that President Trump did in Phoenix he attacks both of the senators from Arizona McCain and flake he attacks McCain because McCain didn't vote for the Obamacare appeal that seems fair to me he attacked flake because flake was mean to him you know that seems to me less productive right now there's a serious possibility that Republicans lose flake seat if flake were to lose the primaries if flake loses the primaries right now I a better shot that flake wins the general then Kelly Ward who's his primary opponent Kelly Ward may be great I don't know that much about her but the fact is that when you're talking about primary and people not because you want to change in their vote but because they're mean to you this is not positive stuff the polls show that that people disapprove of Trump's behavior largely for all the talk about Trump propping up Republicans in 2016 it was really the other way around Trump performed every single Republican Senate candidate throughout the country except perhaps from the I think there was a Senate race in Ohio where he over performed but that was a rarity the vast majority of cases Trump underperformed the Republican Senate candidate so is really Republicans who dragged Trump across the finish line not the other way around and right now there's the possibility that if Trump doesn't get his act together he could drag down a few Senate candidates it's almost impossible for Republicans to lose the Senate this time around that's just the way that it works remember senators are elected once every six years and we rotate so only a third of the Senate is up every two years this two-year cycle is very very bad for Democrats but Trump's activities could hurt Republicans there's a new George Washington University battleground poll trying to get a sense of how Americans feel about Trump's behavior and it's it ain't good okay basically asked if they agree or disagree with the statement that Trump's behavior is not what I expect from a president 71% agreed only 27 percent disagreed 68 percent people said they were worried that Trump's words and actions could get us accidentally involved in an international conflict just 29 percent disagreed do these polls really matter very much they only matter if something goes wrong if people are already predisposed to blame Trump if something goes wrong what happens when something goes wrong I think that's what we're being set up for this weekend by the way I think that we are being set up for this weekend there's a big hurricane scheduled to hit Texas and the media are all over the the media are all over this thing the media are very much focused on what's happening in this hurricane in Texas you know they will see how bad the hurricane is but if there is some sort of disaster and Trump is not immediately Ani I promise you they're looking for another Hurricane Katrina situation and they know that the public is predisposed to think the Trump is chaotic and doesn't know how to govern it so Trump better do a great job with it Trump is at 34 35 percent approval rating right now he has not experienced any serious crisis like zero serious crises so if there is a crisis and he Boches it then you could see him tank and that really could hurt Republicans meanwhile there's chaos inside his own administration I don't like this very much Gary Cohen who is president Trump's top economic adviser he said quote the administration can and must do better and consistently and unequivocally can unequivocally condemning groups like white supremacist groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities he said he felt compelled to quote voice my distress over the events of the past two weeks he said he was disgusted and appalled with Crump's response to white nationalists role in the violence Charlottesville I agree with a lot of this by the way but Gary you work for the guy you work for the guy like shouldn't you say that to him he'd say I understand you're in a difficult situation when you work for Trump because if you feel like you're doing a good job you don't want to give up the power to help the American people but you still are working for Trump you know somebody at the company had a severe disagreement with me publicly it would be a problem and it was a problem for Trump when people inside his own administration are ripping him publicly and openly get laid Gary Cohn is it'll talk more about that plus I do want to talk about the Democrats new attempt to cast Trump as a crazy man and we'll get to the mailbag but first

largest conservative podcast in the nation so I agree with a lot of what Gary Cohen is saying about Trump's response to Charlotte's well but I don't work for Trump I understand Trump making a move against Gary cone now if you were going to do so and I do wonder if Gary Cohen is setting himself up for that I wonder if Gary Cohen his Trump's economic adviser is setting himself up so that when Trump fires him he can say that Trump fired him for insubordination on an issue where Trump was wrong rather than firing him for being a globalist right which is sort of what Breitbart wants him to be fired for but there is this burgeoning attempt by people on the left and some people on the on the right to cast Trump as a crazy person a Democratic congresswoman yesterday suggested that there are signs that worried us about Trump's mental health is Zoe Lofgren of California comparing Trump to a person who has Alzheimer's actually the legislation urges the Vice President along with the cabinet to secure the assistance of medical professionals as has been noted by your prelim into this a lot of people are concerned about the president's behavior he seems to lack impulse control he swings from topic to topic any of us who's had an older person that we know suffering from a mental decline can see certain signs that worry us okay so this kind of nonsense you're not supposed to say this stuff publicly generally because I mean this is what they called the Goldwater rule that you're not supposed to psychologically assess people that you don't know very well I mean we used to do it all the time with with Obama say they had a narcissistic personality disorder but that's not quite the same thing as saying the president is legit crazy like Obama was clearly a narcissist but that doesn't mean he can't do his job Trump I think also is a narcissist I think that he fits the textbook definition of a narcissist but that does not mean that he's not capable of doing his job this is all building up so that if Trump does something wrong everybody's ready to pounce this is all the setup the punchline is coming okay there's all the setup the punchline is kind plus I'm sorry Democrats can't talk about crazy old people if they're not gonna mention Nancy Pelosi here's the the minority leader in the house talking about free speech see if you can see what she's saying that is wrong and stupid could the Park Service justify denying that organization their free speech right because the Constitution does not say that a person can shout yell wolf in a crowded theater if you are endangering people then you're you don't have a constitutional right to do that okay so she's wrong on the law and also why would you shout wolf in a crowded theater it's a weird thing to shout they shouting elephant in a crowded theater and she means fire in a crowded theater but she's a dummy so she says wolf in a crowded theater um yeah if we're gonna talk crazy town's then then crazy Nancy Pelosi should be at the top of that list Democrats really don't get to go down this path okay time for some things I like things I hate then we'll do a fulsome mailbag so things I like this week we've been doing things associated with blindness because of the Eclipse this is actually a very serious movie about blindness this is a it's a terrific film The Miracle Worker the Academy Award winners Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke and Bancroft plays Helen Keller teacher Patty Duke plays Helen Keller and this is one of the this is sort of the climactic scene of the movie the the scene in which Helen Keller realizes that words are associated with with objects because she's basically grown up unable to speak unable to communicate properly and she's frustrated about it and here is Anne Bancroft as her teacher teaching her what water is it has a name I mean is an amazing story history colony color is truly incredible you know the woman was blind and deaf and couldn't speak and somehow they figure she actually would give speeches I mean by the end of her life she was giving for many years she gave speeches on college campuses okay litter imagine trying to learn how to speak if you can't see somebody's mouth move and you can't hear what they're saying I mean it's an unbelievable thing and the movie The Miracle Worker is a classic this young Anne Bancroft people remember Anne Bancroft from graduate which is a garbage movie but this is an actual good movie The Miracle Worker with Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke and Mathis don't give me that look the graduates garbage we'll talk about that another time we will do a deconstructing the culture on why Malthus is wrong about about that particular movie okay so other things I like intend there's a baseball brawl I have to show it that's just the way it works so there's a baseball brawl yesterday between the Tigers and the Yankees the funny thing about baseball brawls is basically the way they work is one person gets in a punch and then everybody just tackles each other and then they just dance around so that's what this baseball brawl look like so Cabrera now will Olek out there's a fight at home plate miguel cabrera going toe-to-toe with Romo and they're swinging with him 'ok yes they were Wow what is the land there's a very funny bitch over there still there when she talked about how because during one of these brawls like everybody cleared to see bullpen coming in people running and he says that in one of these brawls he and the guy from the opposite team we're friends and snowed actually just like fake punch each other they like dance around they fake punch it looked like they were really clock each other but that's what baseball brawls always remind me of the number of great baseball brawls is really low yeah there was it there's one last year where there's things between Texas and Blue Jays where where the second baseman threw a punch that was like a first class it was a first class cross but mostly these baseball fights are not very good okay time for a quick thing I hate and then I wanna get to the mailbag okay so the thing that I hate today one of the things that really annoys me is how there's a double standard with regard to the sorts of racist jokes that people make so there's this game of thrones parody that is not very good that was pushed by huffington post a woman in karolina moreno wrote about this this game of thrones parody called gente of Thrones says this once no knows something so what is it it's a bunch of it the idea is that all of the kingdoms have to get together to stop the White Walkers okay this is supposed to be in Manhattan so what are the White Walkers this is the very end of the parody what are the White Walkers of course who they have to get together to stop you'll see this perfect place fix-up I can't wait to try one of those chopped cheese everybody's been talking about it shows a bunch of Hispanic people Dominican Republic and Puerto Ricans saying we have to get together and then they go up to the the north of New York and who's coming in is a bunch of hipsters carrying coffee gentrifying the place oh god they have to be stopped it's so terrible the white walkers okay now we can all kind of laugh at that I guess but can you imagine if the situation were reversed imagine if for example there are a bunch of people who made a parody video game of Thrones about building a wall to keep out the White Walkers and it turned out it was a bunch of illegal immigrants from Mexico can you imagine the number of racist accusations that would appear and it would likely be partially right okay this is racist when you say that a bunch of urban hipsters are white walkers who must be prevented from entering Manhattan because they're ruining the city listen New York's garbage anyway okay let's be real about this there are parts of New York that are okay but New York City but I'm sorry for people who live there like it's a fun place to visit my sister has lived there for a while but like if you're coming in and gentrifying crappy areas of the city like half the city used to look like escape from New York so if you're coming in in gentrifying and building a coffee house I really don't think you've done anything deeply wrong okay I don't get to the mail bag so let's just do that now mat says do you think a black kid from the inner city has a greater than average chance of getting accepted to college because of affirmative action or a less than average chance because they graduated from a crappy school so the answer is that they have a greater than average chance of being accepted to college but they have a less than average chance of graduating from high school with the proper grades okay that's just the statistical fact so if you graduate from high school with the same grades as a kid who isn't like we don't want to compare apples and oranges it is a complex social phenomenon schools in the inner city are not very good parenting in the inner city is largely not as good as parenting in the suburbs and that's not just because of the quality that's not because of the quality of people per se is because of the qualities of the decisions made by parents if you're a single mom it's gonna be very hard for you to provide the same sort of environment learning environment you know in a crime-ridden area that it is for a two-parent household in the suburbs to provide that environment for a kid that's not a racial thing that's nothing but black and white a black two-parent family and the suburbs is going to be better off than a single mom in the inner city but it means that kids tend to underperform in the inner-city academically which is why when you a lot of those kids moved to charter schools outside those neighborhoods they suddenly perform really well this is why we shouldn't lock kids down to the public school in their neighborhood we should allow them freedom of choice to go to schools outside their neighborhood then there's the question of affirmative action affirmative action is constructed in order to make it easier for black kids from the inner city to get into school I mean that's what it's constructed to do so of course it's easier by that standard hey Daniel says hello Ben will you ever grow a beard and is taxation theft so two weird questions will I grow a beard so there I've I've grown some pretty heavy stubble it starts to itch it gets to a certain point it's really itchy so I'm not really huge on the growing of the beard also I mean look at this Poonam we want to hide that behind a beard unless they're gonna troll a girl like a tormund Giantsbane style like heavy beard and just look like i was gonna crack someone's skull all the time then maybe that seems like a lot of work and a lot of grooming and food gets caught in it so I'm not so big on it is taxation theft so my view on taxation is as I say as I said before Reid Richard Epstein's book takings basically taxation is theft unless you're getting back the amount of services that justify the taxation and it has to be you getting back the amount of services not society at large you so if you are taxed for the Defense Department it is the purpose of tax not the amount of tax that's really at issue so the purpose of taxation if I don't tax you because there's an imminent nuclear assault on the United States and we need to build up our defense cap capabilities you're getting back the benefit right you are being taxed for a collective benefit of which you receive if you tax me for welfare I'm not receiving the welfare so you're just taking my money and giving it to someone else then taxation is theft it's redistribution Haley says do you think one should go to college for a degree they don't currently need is it worthwhile to have a degree just in case thanks well depends on the degree I mean I think that your your degree should always be focused toward job prospects I think that you know if you want to go get a degree in Western Civ go for it but that doesn't necessarily come along with a job offer I I think that it's very important that people be educated and be ready to work even if they are not currently doing so so even before I was married I always wanted to marry someone who had the capacity to get a good-paying job specifically because I think that it's important if god forbid something should happen to me that my wife be able to take care of our I think that's that's a decent decent measure of getting an education but you shouldn't get a degree if you're better off not getting a degree if you're better off moving to Nebraska and working on a pipeline then do that it's all about jobs daniel says what do you think is the biggest obstacle standing in the way of a libertarian republican merger so it used to be a social conservative view of what government ought to do it is not anymore then now the biggest obstacle is the basic Republican idea that government should be involved in a ton of crap okay the government should be involved in fixing the world I don't think government should be involved in fixing the world libertarians are right about that on the other hand as I say I think libertarians look at Republicans and conservatives and they say you people with your crazy churches and your crazy God why can't you just read I in Rand and the reality is that without that that church based social fabric without that judeo-christian value based social fabric you can't have a libertarian society it quickly devolves into into nihilism and quickly devolves until libertarianism will devolve into Liberty nism without us being able to restrain ourselves right this is John Adams entire point he can't have a free country without a moral and religious people channeland says hello I would like to answer my question you read last week remember I read a very bizarre question last week about puppies kitties piglets and baby sea turtles what do they have in common I said they're all animals well apparently the correct answer was they they make people if somebody said they make people happy no that's a stupid answer Williams says all of these mentioned babies are protected by law but human babies are not so that was that that is a that is a better answer but not even it's really not a true answer I mean the fact is that once a baby is born it's protected by law I don't know that unborn baby sea turtles are protected by law although they may be they may very well be Travis says some will say that God has established morality in our hearts then why do some of us have different or bad morals and if it is based on belief then why do we not have an epidemic of crime among atheists I believe that morals come from parents and other adults during young age and not from the existence or belief in God or religion well okay so two things one that is begging a question when you say that morals come from your parents and that your parents and society teach you about morals I agree where did they get them where did they come from you just said they don't come from from the human heart so don't your parents have a human heart where their standards come from I mean at some point to work humans on planet earth where do they get their morals so you can't have it both ways you can't say that nature doesn't generate morality but your parents generate morality without revelation doesn't work that way if you want to make the natural law case that human marette that morality springs up in human hearts you can do that and you can then say Revelation is less important but if you're going to deny nature and natural morality then it's very difficult to deny revelation as the source of morality so that is that that's my answer on that you know as far as why do we not have an epidemic of crime among atheists because atheists were raised in a judeo-christian value system and still believed in the fundamentals of that value system even if they don't believe in the God that provided them as far as natural law then the idea that the human mind reflects God's mind on morality I think obviously there are certain basic things that most human societies have in common like don't murder right I think that the Judaic take on what are the things that I actually mentioned this earlier in the show without even reading this letter basic takes on things like don't kill people that I think is pretty well embedded in the in the human code but don't kill people verses war is an interesting distinction because a lot of societies have discovered don't kill people but there are also very few societies that have discovered that don't kill people applies to everyone right everyone who's not actively attacking you Isaac says hi Ben I'm uncertain of my stance on law enforcement what are your thoughts on balancing the power of law enforcement and the protection of civil rights could all problems be solved simply by getting rid of bad laws for example the war on drugs could privatization play a role so I think that you should not put a law in the books unless you want it enforced I think that law enforcement is there to protect your rights if they're not protecting their rights then they've obviously exceeded their their mandate drew says Ben why is it the larger cities in history are typically the most evil blatantly sinful Nineveh Sodom Gomorrah Rome Las Vegas New York thanks for what you do drew well I wouldn't exactly compare Sodom and Gomorrah to New York Las Vegas is a better argument but I think the answer is that when you stack a lot of people in a very small amount of space then there's a lot of conflicts that inherently rises up and there's two ways of dealing with the conflicts one is with tyranny and the others the others with libertinism when you have people who are separated and they're and they're in family units and there's not a lot of people right around them you to focus in on how do you make your family good right and there's less friction from the people right around you but think of living an apartment like I live in a house now but we lived in a condo for a while there's obviously more conflict with the person on the other side of the wall in the condo then there is what the person on the other side of my wall on my house there's more separation that conflict means we have to come up with a basic agreement that agreements either going to be that we abide by a certain set of rules together or and that can very quickly devolve into tyranny because we all want to control each other's behavior or it can devolve into you do whatever you want on your side of the wall I'll do whatever I want on my side of the wall never the twain shall meet but then when you piss me off I'll kill you right there that and very often that's how it ends in big cities people aren't people as much as we like to talk about people meet other people we do but too much of other people will make you crazy Michael says what's his ben shapiro have to stop himself from buying if he finds himself with some extra cash or do you just stockpile it like Scrooge McDuck and swim in it with the leftist here's mug in hand so I do in fact have a Scrooge McDuck money bin I didn't do enjoy swimming around in it and just bathing in my cash my Moodle zuv cash but what do I have to stop myself from buying so I don't I mean books typically but I don't stop myself from buying books because it's part of my ongoing quest to learn things I buy lots and lots of books I have piles of books around my house I have a pile right next to my bed drives my wife insane I've got a pile of books next to my bed that's got to be 40 books high and I'm gradually going through it and then you know there's that meme have you seen that meme of the guy who's walking with the girl and then he turns around looks at the other girl right this is the this is this meme that's going around online now very famous so I thought that the best version of that was a guy walking next to the girl and the girls his girlfriend and the girlfriend was booked on my bedside stand and then the one who he's checking out is new book that just came out and that's sort of my problem is that I have a bunch of books that I have to read and been sitting there for months and then I see a new book that came out and I want to read it so books is the big one the other thing is at some point I want to buy myself a really nice violin my violin is not very good my violin is like I got it for my grandfather it's probably worth maybe six or seven grand but a really nice violin costs a minimum of twenty five grand probably and so I am definitely stocking up for that emmanuel says do you think Republicans will ever win statewide elected office in California again or we do missing further and further into the abyss of the left the answer is yes I do think that Republicans will win again through one of two things one things get so bad that Republicans just the default position and people react people wise up second all over the leftists eventually leave California after ruining the state Republicans reoccupy the state in a hundred years and it becomes read again alright this is my theory of population movement is that Republicans come conservatives come make a place awesome leftist follow make the place crap conservatives leave the place devolves further into crap leftists leave conservatives reoccupy and make it good okay Karen says hey Ben my parents got a pet hamster this weekend they named him mr. Shapiro and your honor I am deeply honored do you think there's a chance Republicans completely abandoned Trump so he can go to go on to create his own political party and they can get some things done in Washington thanks for doing what you do well I don't think that Republicans will abandon Trump I think Trump may abandon Republicans I think Trump may get so frustrated that he decides screw you I'm forming my own little coalition and he goes some people on the left and some people in the Republican Party and tries to get things done the problem is that people who love him from the Republican Party are not even close to the people who are sort of okay with him on the Left the people okay with him on the left like big government the people who are okay with him on the right are typically very much in favor of his regulatory cuts for example so there's not a lot of common ground there okay so here are a couple of live questions what is your ferret favorite Monty Python skit or movie so my favorite Monty Python movie is Holy Grail obviously that and my favorite skit in that movie is still the duck skit the witch in the duck skit well Neal says would you consider being gay a byproduct of free well from God in other terms we have gay people if religion never existed and science was our only foundation would it be considered counterproductive to the species well I mean I don't know that's a weird way to put it I would suggest that all sexual activity has a voluntary component I don't know that all sexual drive has a voluntary component your temptation is your temptation I think there are environmental impact on your temptation I mean every study ever done has suggested this but I think that the notion that it is pure science that if it weren't for if it weren't for our capacity to choose would there be homosexuality sure I mean bonobos have have homosexuality so the idea that that only heterosexuality can be found in nature is not true what evolution select against it yes evolution would clearly select against it would remain a very very small contingent of the population okay Mitchell says then I've noticed our generation just wants to fight to make everything fair why do most young people think life is going to be fair how do we convince them it's never gonna be fair all we ever hear is how we deserve and it's not fair but both of these statements are stupid no one deserves anything life will never be fair Mitch I agree with you one of my pet peeves is the idea that life is fair it's because in America we want people to have a fair shot but having a fair shot does not mean fairness of outcome and it's very easy to mix up the two we tend to look at two people who have an unequal outcome and then we say Society must have screwed them that's not right it's quite possible that they make decisions in their life that were bad or that they started from different places in society didn't do anything to them okay Zachary say hey Beth says Haman as a Christian who is exploring my faith I'm interested in learning more about Judaism how welcoming is the synagogue to Christians well you can show up I mean like no one's gonna throw you out we don't do conversions so the it's difficult to convert to Judaism we actually discourage conversions mainly because you're taking on an enormous number of Commandments that you actually don't need to do to get into heaven but if you're interested in learning about Judaism there are a lot of books on it the synagogue probably wouldn't be the best place to start is the truth because we mumble a lot to ourselves for two hours basically that's what an Orthodox service looks like there's some singing but there's a lot of mumbling and so if you're not ensconced in that then it probably does not it's not like it's not where you go for a great time this synagogue but if you're looking to learn about Judaism I would start with the Old Testament read the Old Testament that's amazing how many people who believe in the Old Testament have a nephew read the thing let's see someone says do you watch Rick and Morty I don't even know what Rick and Morty is so I will have to check it out Mathis is giving me a skeptical look Mathis is my adopted son dictates that I must actually check it out so I will now check out Rick and Morty that has now become an obligation upon me well we'll find out how that goes okay so finally we've reached the bottom of the mailbag there are no more questions to be asked this week but if you wish to subscribe the next week you too can be part of the mailbag and have all of your life questions answered we'll be back here on Monday try not to screw things up okay you did ok last weekend it wasn't so bad last weekend please try not to screw things up so much this weekend I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
