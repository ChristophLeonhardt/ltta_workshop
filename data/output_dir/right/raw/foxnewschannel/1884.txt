1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:01,777
BENJAMIN HALL, THANK YOU IN

2
00:00:01,777 --> 00:00:02,278
JERUSALEM.

3
00:00:02,278 --> 00:00:03,579
I'M WATCHING MIKE PENCE ON THE

4
00:00:03,579 --> 00:00:04,947
STAGE NOW IN INDIANA.

5
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:06,816
WE'LL TAKE YOU THERE LIVE IN

6
00:00:06,816 --> 00:00:07,316
JUST A MOMENT.

7
00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:08,985
COLONEL MICHAEL WALTZ HERE WITH

8
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:09,719
ME.

9
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,487
FORMER GREEN BERET COMMANDER AND

10
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:12,488
COUNTER TERRORIZER TO VICE

11
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:13,589
PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY.

12
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:14,123
GOOD EVENING TO YOU.

13
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:15,024
>> HI, BILL.

14
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:15,458
GOOD EVENING.

15
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,259
>> MY SENSE IS THAT YOU GO BACK

16
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:19,195
12 YEARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, YOU

17
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:20,596
THINK ABOUT SOUTHERN LEBANON,

18
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:22,398
THE BUILD-UP OF HEZBOLLAH AND

19
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:24,266
THE AMOUNT OF ROCKETS THEY HAVE.

20
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:27,503
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE OR TWO

21
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:28,804
RAMP THIS THING UP.

22
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:30,139
I THINK THAT'S THE POINT THAT WE

23
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:32,073
HAVE REACHED AT THE MOMENT.

24
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,976
DOES IT GO THERE?

25
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:35,411
OR DOES IT COOL DOWN?

26
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,580
>> WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THE

27
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,981
CULMINATION OF A COUPLE THINGS.

28
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:41,817
ONE, YOU KNOW, IRAN AND

29
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:44,520
HEZBOLLAH HAVE MADE MORE GAINS

30
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,455
IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS UNDER

31
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:48,190
BOTH AS A RESULT OF THE BILLIONS

32
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,059
THAT FLOWED IN TO TEHRAN AS PART

33
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:53,896
OF THE IRAN DEAL AND ESSENTIALLY

34
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:54,697
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TURNING

35
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:55,798
ITS BACK ON THE REGION.

36
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:57,767
THAT IS COMING TO A HEAD NOW.

37
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,835
A LOT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

38
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,637
CRITICS ARE TRYING TO BLAME THE

39
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:02,938
TIMING OF THIS ON HIM BACKING

40
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,407
OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL.

41
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:06,208
AS YOU NOTED, THIS HAS BEEN

42
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,677
BUILDING FOR SOME TIME.

43
00:01:07,677 --> 00:01:10,946
LISTEN, BILL, THE IRANIAN REGIME

44
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,082
HAS NOT BEEN BUILDING ROADS AND

45
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:13,849
BRIDGES WITH THE BILLIONS THAT

46
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,518
FLOWED IN.

47
00:01:15,518 --> 00:01:18,287
THEY'VE BEEN ON A SHOPPING SPREE

48
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,789
WITH MOSCOW AND RUSSIAN

49
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:20,489
WEAPONRY, NUMBER 1.

50
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:23,392
NUMBER 2, PUMPING THE MONEY INTO

51
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:25,127
ITS PROXIES INTO SYRIA.

52
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,663
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE SEEN SO MANY

53
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:30,900
PROTESTS IN TEHRAN BECAUSE THE

54
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,301
IRANIAN PEOPLE HAD AN

55
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,335
EXPECTATION THAT THE BILLIONS

56
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:35,438
COMING IN WOULD HELP THE

57
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:35,838
ECONOMY.

58
00:01:35,838 --> 00:01:37,840
INSTEAD, THEY HAVE SEEN THE

59
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,709
REGIME UP IT INTO MILITARY

60
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:40,176
INFRASTRUCTURE.

61
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:41,944
>> IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT THE

62
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:43,612
ISRAELIS HAD THEIR EYES ON THESE

63
00:01:43,612 --> 00:01:45,281
TARGETS A LONG TIME, IN AN

64
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:52,722
AROUND DAMASCUS, ARMED BUT I

65
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:53,389
IRANIAN FORCES.

66
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:54,623
THEY WENT AFTER THEM.

67
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:56,959
THEY'RE REPORTING THIS MISSION

68
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,627
WAS A COMPLETE SUCCESS.

69
00:01:58,627 --> 00:01:59,562
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU

70
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:02,398
CHARACTERIZE THAT JUST YET,

71
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:02,732
MICHAEL.

72
00:02:02,732 --> 00:02:04,700
>> I WOULD CALL IT A BUTT

73
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,968
WHIPPING TO USE THE TERM THAT WE

74
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:07,136
USE IN THE SOUTH.

75
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:09,939
THE ISRAELIS REALLY SMACKED THE

76
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,640
IRANIANS HARD HERE.

77
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,209
I WOULD CALL IT TWO THINGS.

78
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,511
ONE, YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE'S A

79
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:19,482
MISCONCEPTION THAT THE IRANIANS

80
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:20,750
ARE ONLY HELPING HEZBOLLAH AND

81
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,652
THE PROXIES IN SYRIA.

82
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:25,020
IRANIAN'S GROUND FORCES ARE ON

83
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,057
THE GROUND IN SYRIA HELPING THE

84
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:30,559
ASSAD REGIME AND PROPPING IT UP

85
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:31,894
AND BUILDING UP ITS

86
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:34,063
INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE ISRAELI

87
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:36,499
BORDER TO HIT OUR GREATEST ALLY.

88
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:37,700
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW AND

89
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,503
KNOWS IS THAT WE HAVE TO STAND

90
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:43,739
WITH OUR ALLY AND THE ISRAELIS

91
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:44,673
ESSENTIALLY TOOK THAT

92
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:45,207
INFRASTRUCTURE OUT.

93
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,876
THIS IS A REAL SHIFT ON THE

94
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:47,409
ISRAELI PART.

95
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,278
THEY HAVE BEEN KIND OF HOLDING

96
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:51,580
BACK AND LETTING ISIS AND THE

97
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,682
SUNNI EXTREMISTS FIGHT IT OUT

98
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:57,686
WITH ASSAD AND HEZBOLLAH AND THE

99
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:59,021
SHIIA EXTREMISTS.

100
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:00,623
IT GOT TO THE POINT NOW WHERE

101
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:03,359
THEY HAD TO STEP INTO A BIG WAY

102
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,161
AND THEY DID SO AND DID SO

103
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:06,095
INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVELY.

104
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:08,664
>> MY FEELING NOW IS WHAT DOES

105
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:10,633
IRAN DO IN KIND?

106
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:11,934
WE CAN'T ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW.

107
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:14,603
BUT ON MONDAY, THE U.S. EMBASSY

108
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:16,172
MOVES FROM TEL AVIV TO

109
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:17,373
JERUSALEM.

110
00:03:17,373 --> 00:03:20,242
THERE WILL BE A U.S. DELEGATION

111
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,778
IN JERUSALEM FOR THAT MOMENT.

112
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:25,981
YOU KNOW THE UNREST ITS CAUSED

113
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:29,185
ALONG THE GAZA STRIP THE PAST

114
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:29,485
MONTH.

115
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:40,162
WHAT IS NEXT THEN?

116
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:40,496
WHAT IS NEXT THEN?

117
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:47,169
>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

118
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:48,637
MILITARILY BUT DIPLOMATICALLY

119
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:50,873
AND REALIZING THE PROMISE OF THE

120
00:03:50,873 --> 00:03:53,142
LAST THREE TO FOUR PRESIDENTS,

121
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:55,544
SINCE THE MID 90s IN TERMS OF

122
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:58,881
RECOGNIZING A CAPITOL THAT IS

123
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:01,383
REALLY ALWAYS EXISTED AND THE

124
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:03,385
ISRAELIS HAVE A RIGHT TO EXIST.

125
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:06,822
ON THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT, THAT'S

126
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:07,656
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN IN FOR

127
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:08,924
SOME TIME AND WE HAVE TO STAND

128
00:04:08,924 --> 00:04:12,094
WITH THE ISRAELIS MILITARILY.

129
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:13,462
THEY CANNOT AND WE SHOULD NOT

130
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,564
ALLOW THE IRANIANS IN A VERY

131
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:17,700
STRONG WAY TO BUILD UP ON THEIR

132
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,033
BORDER.

133
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,702
THEY'VE TAKEN THEM OUT.

134
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:21,769
>> Bill: ONE MORE QUESTION.

135
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,306
THESE PEOPLE IN ELKHART INSIDE

136
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,009
THAT GYM, HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT

137
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:29,211
RIPPING UP THE NUCLEAR DEAL WITH

138
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:29,612
IRAN?

139
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:31,080
I GUESS IS YOU LIKE IT WHEN YOU

140
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,514
STICK IT TO THEM.

141
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:34,583
>> THEY REALIZE AND THEY SEE

142
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,885
THIS PRESIDENT AS STANDING WITH

143
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,386
OUR ALLIES AND SHOWING STRENGTH

144
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:39,588
TO OUR ADVERSARIES, WHETHER THAT

145
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:43,292
IS NORTH KOREA, CHINA, RUSSIA OR

146
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:43,659
IRAN.

147
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:48,898
WHAT WE ALL INSTINCTIVELY KNOW

148
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:50,165
IS THAT THOSE REGIMES RESPECT

149
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,100
AND RESPOND TO STRENGTH.

150
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,235
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN

151
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:53,636
NORTH KOREA.

152
00:04:53,636 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL SEE WITH THE
