I heard there UNITA mission in Libya but
there is no imagination in Libya and we
need the United Nation here rather die
than stay here
we're like dead people here
with the EU applying pressure on Libya
to address the migrant crisis the
militias see this as an opportunity and
with factions now fighting for
legitimacy competition is fierce in a
wealthier suburb of Tripoli a rival
faction had already been absorbed into
Libya's central security they just
rounded up a group of migrants ready to
be moved to a detention center

although we were unable to verify the
migrants story if numbers and arrests
are becoming a way for the militias to
legitimize themselves than thousands of
migrants who are now residing and
working in Libya could also be at risk
of being detained

back at the camp in Tijera the militia
had started putting the migrants to work
and were renovating the site
since our last visit they've connected
electricity and today they're installing
burning water and opening a shower room
for the men
you name it we'll move on and a lot
those lambs Joel the moment I touch upon

I'm good I'll
despite the conditions washing for the
first time in weeks offered some relief
running water was also being installed
over at the women's halls when you guys
left one guy came and he asked us what
we were saying they started asking us
why we're talking the truth so everybody
kept quiet they did not say that I was
the one talking but they told us not to
say anything
everybody's they can't say anything
because they are scared but I'm
sacrificing my life for a change because
I really need to change my family back
at home a change
everybody in here need change we do not
come here to eat or work we don't want
their electric city we don't want their
water we don't want your food we just
want to go if we're not going to get any
help from anybody we want to go to the
sea we're not this is like death for us
we're not scared of death we are
Eritrean our main aim is to go to Europe
if we don't make it we're okay with it
because we rather die than to stay here
this is like we're like dead people here
I heard there UNITA mission in Libya but
there is no imagination in Lima and we
need the United Nation here despite some
improvements the conditions of the camp
are still rudimentary and desperate even
while being filmed some of the soldiers
looked under the influence of drugs
if the militias are to become part of
the state more and more migrants futures
will be placed in their hands vomit

since leaving the camp we made contact
with a detainee who had made it out he
told us that the militia had sold him
and over two dozen others to a
trafficker for twenty six thousand
dollars the traffickers then held him
prisoner until his family paid for his
freedom highlighting just how much of a
commodity the refugees and migrants had
become before leaving the camp he told
us that the militia had started to
prepare the migrants for labour
for men that tried to escape the camp
were killed on the spot and women who
tried to run were tortured
as Libya's internal fight for stability
continues and the militias cents a
political and business opportunity
it looks unlikely that the surrender
custody of the refugees making these
people a pawn in the militias quest for
power
