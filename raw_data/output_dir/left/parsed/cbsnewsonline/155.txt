PRESS SECRETARY PRESS SECRETARY 
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS IS 
SPEAKING. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 
-- PRESS SECRETARY SARAH 
HUCKABEE SANDERS IS SPEAKING. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 
I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF 
FACTS PUT OUT THERE, BUT 
HOPEFULLY WE CAN CLARIFY SOME 
THINGS TODAY. 
I JUST WANTED TO START BY 
THANKING THE SHERIFFS OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEAKING 
TO THEM THIS MORNING AT THE 
NATIONAL SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION 
CONFERENCE. 
WE ARE SO THANKFUL FOR THEIR 
PARTNERSHIP AT DHS AND ALL THEY 
DO TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY. 
SO I THANK THEM. 
SO I WANT TO PROVIDE YOU AN 
UPDATE ON THE ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION CRISIS ON OUR 
SOUTHERN BORDER AND THE EFFECTS 
THE EFFORTS THE ADMINISTRATION 
IS TAKING TO STOP THIS CRISIS 
AND STOP THE FLOOD OF ILLEGAL 
DRUGS, CONTRABAND AND CRIME 
COMING ACROSS THE BORDER. 
LET'S START WITH A FEW NUMBERS 
AND FACTS. 
IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS WE 
HAVE SEEN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER EXCEED 
50,000 PEOPLE EACH MONTH, 
MULTIPLES OVER EACH MONTH LAST 
YEAR OF SINCE THIS TIME LAST 
YEAR THERE HAS BEEN A325% 
INCREASE IN UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN 
CHILDREN AND A 435% INCREASE IN 
FAMILY UNITS ENTERING THE 
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. 
OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS THERE 
HAS BEEN A 1,700% INCREASE IN 
ASYLUM CLAIMS RESULTING IN 
ASYLUM BACKLOG TODAY IN OUR 
COUNTRY OF 600,000 CASES. 
SINCE 2013 THE UNITED STATES 
HAS ADMITTED MORE THAN HALF A 
MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT 
MINORS AND FAMILY UNITS FROM 
CENTRAL AMERICA, MOST OF WHOM 
TODAY ARE AT LARGE IN THE 
UNITED STATES. 
AT THE SAME TIME LARGE CRIMINAL 
ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS MS-13 
HAVE VIOLATED OUR BORDERS AND 
GAINED A DEADLY FOOTHOLD WITHIN 
THE UNITED STATES. 
THIS ENTIRE CRISIS JUST TO BE 
CLEAR IS NOT NEW. 
IT'S BEEN OCCURRING AND 
EXPANDED OVER MANY DECADES, BUT 
CURRENTLY IT IS THE EXCLUSIVE 
PRODUCT OF LOOPHOLES IN OUR 
FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAWS THAT 
PREVENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT 
MINORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS FROM 
BEING DETAINED AND REMOVED TO 
THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. 
IN OTHER WORDS, THESE LOOPHOLES 
CREATE A FUNCTIONALLY OPEN 
BORDER. 
APPREHENSION WITHOUT DETENTION 
AND REMOVAL IS NOT BORDER 
SECURITY. 
WE HAVE REPEATEDLY CALLED ON 
CONGRESS TO CLOSE THESE 
LOOPHOLES. 
I MYSELF HAVE MET WITH AS MANY 
MEMBERS HAVE BEEN WILLING TO 
MEET WITH ME. 
I TESTIFIED SEVEN TIMES. 
I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE MYSELF 
AVAILABLE TO ASK THEY WORK WITH 
US TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS. 
YET THE VOICES MOST LOUDLY 
CRITICIZING THE FORCE. 
OF OUR CURRENT LAWS ARE THOSE 
WHOSE POLICIES CREATED THIS 
CRISIS AND WHOSE POLICIES 
PERPETRATE IT. 
IN PARTICULAR, WE NEED TO 
REFORM THREE MAJOR LOOPHOLES. 
LET ME QUICKLY WALK YOU THROUGH 
THEM. 
FIRST WE NEED TO AMEND THE 2008 
TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PREVENTION 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT OR TVPR 
WHICH IS MUCH EASIER TO SAY. 
THIS LAW ENCOURAGES FAMILIES TO 
PUT CHILDREN IN THE HANDS OF 
SMUGGLERS TO BRING THEM ALONE 
ON THIS DANGEROUS TREK 
NORTHWARD AND MAKE NO MISTAKE. 
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. 
THIS TREK IS DANGEROUS AND 
DEADLY. 
SECOND, WE NEED TO REFORM OUR 
ASYLUM LAWS TO END THE SYSTEMIC 
ABUSE OF OUR ASYLUM SYSTEM AND 
STOP FRAUD. 
RIGHT NOW OUR ASYLUM SYSTEM 
GAMES TO ASSIST ASYLUM SEEKERS 
WHO LEGITIMATELY NEED IT. 
WE ARE A COUNTRY OF COMPASSION. 
WE ARE A COUNTRY OF HEART. 
WE MUST FIX THE SYSTEM SO THAT 
THOSE WHO TRULY NEED ASYLUM 
CAN, IN FACT, RECEIVE IT. 
THIRD, WE NEED TO AMEND THE 
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RECENT 
EXPANSIONS WHICH WOULD ALLOW 
FOR FAMILY DETENTION DURING THE 
REMOVAL PROCESS AND WE NEED 
CONGRESS TO FULLY FUND OUR 
ABILITY TO HOLD FAMILIES 
TOGETHER THROUGH THE 
IMMIGRATION PROCESS. 
UNTIL THESE LOOPHOLES ARE 
CLOSED BY CONGRESS IT IS NOT 
POSSIBLE AS A MATTER OF LAW TO 
DETAIN AND REMOVE WHOLE FAMILY 
UNITS WHO ARRIVE ILLEGALLY IN 
THE UNITED STATES. 
CONGRESS AND THE COURTS CREATED 
THIS PROBLEM AND CONGRESS ALONE 
CAN FIX IT. 
UNTIL THEN WE WILL ENFORCE 
EVERY LAW WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS 
TO DEFEND THE SOVEREIGNTY AND 
SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES. 
THOSE WHO CRITICIZE THE 
ENFORCEMENT OF OUR LAWS HAVE 
OFFERED ONLY ONE 
COUNTERMEASURE, OPEN BORDERS. 
THE QUICK RELEASE OF ALL 
ILLEGAL ALIEN FAMILIES AND THE 
DECISION NOT TO ENFORCE OUR 
LAWS. 
THIS POLICY WOULD BE 
DISASTROUS. 
ITS PRIME BENEFICIARIES WOULD 
BE THE SMUGGLING ORGANIZATIONS 
THEMSELVES AND THE PRIME 
VICTIMS WOULD BE THE CHILDREN 
WHO WOULD BE PLUNGED INTO THE 
SMUGGLING MACHINES AND GET GANG 
RECRUITMENT ON THE TRIP NORTH. 
THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION 
ABOUT WHAT D HS IS AND IS NOT 
DOING AS IT RELATES TO FAMILIES 
AT THE BORDER AND I WANT TO 
CORRECT THE RECORD. 
HERE ARE THE FACTS. 
FIRST THIS ADMINISTRATION DID 
NOT CREATE A POLICY OF 
SEPARATING FAMILIES AT THE 
BORDER. 
WE HAVE A STATUTORY 
RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE TAKE 
SERIOUSLY TO PROTECT ALIEN 
CHILDREN FROM HUMAN SMUGGLING, 
TRAFFICKING AND OTHER CRIMINAL 
ACTIONS WHILE ENFORCING OUR 
IMMIGRATION LAWS. 
WE HAVE A LONG EXISTING POLICY, 
MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE 
FOLLOWED THAT OUTLINE WHEN WE 
MAY TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT 
CHILDREN. 
WE WILL SEPARATE THOSE WHO 
CLAIM TO BE A PARENT AND CHILD 
IF WE CANNOT DETERMINE A 
FAMILIAR OR CUSTODIAL 
RELATIONSHIP EXISTS. 
FOR EXAMPLE, IF THERE'S NO 
DOCUMENTATION TO CONFIRM THE 
CLAIMED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN 
ADULT AND A CHILD. 
WE DO SO IF THE PARENT IS A 
NATIONAL SECURITY, PUBLIC OR 
SAFETY RISK INCLUDING WHEN 
THERE ARE CRIMINAL CHARGES AT 
ISSUE AND IT MAY NOT BE 
APPROPRIATE TO MAINTAIN THE 
FAMILY IN DETENTION TOGETHER. 
WE ALSO SEPARATE A PARENT AND 
CHILD IF THE ADULT IS SUSPECTED 
OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. 
THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE 
MINORS HAVE BEEN USED AND 
TRAFFICKED BY UNRELATED ADULTS 
IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID DETENTION 
AND I STOP HERE TO SAY IN THE 
LAST FIVE MONTHS WE HAVE A 314% 
INCREASE IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN 
ARRIVING AT THE BORDER 
FRAUDULENTLY CLAIMING TO BE A 
FAMILY UNIT. 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY OF CONCERN. 
SEPARATION CAN OCCUR WHEN THE 
PARENT IS CHARGED WITH HUMAN 
SMUGGLING. 
UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WE 
ÃºW 
APPROPRIATE SECURE DETENTION 
FACILITY SEPARATE FROM THE 
CHILD. 
WHAT HAS CHANGED IS THAT WE NO 
LONGER EXEMPT ENTIRE CLASSES OF 
PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE LAW. 
EVERYONE IS SUBJECT TO 
PROSECUTION. 
WHEN DHS REFERS A CASE AGAINST 
A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN FOR 
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION, THE 
PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN WILL 
BE PLACED INTO THE U.S. MARSHAL 
SERVICE CUSTODY FOR PRETRIAL 
DETERMINATION PURSUANT TO AN 
ORDER BY A FEDERAL JUDGE AND 
ANY ACCOMPANIED CHILD WILL BE 
TRANSFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT 
OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 
AND WILL BE RECLASSIFIED AS AN 
UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN CHILD. 
THAT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 
TVPRA, A LAW THAT WAS PASSED BY 
CONGRESS AND A FOLLOWING COURT 
ORDER, NEITHER WHICH ARE 
ACTIONS THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN. 
LET'S BE CLEAR. 
IF AN AMERICAN WERE TO COMMIT A 
CRIME ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED 
STATES, THEY WOULD GO TO JAIL 
AND THEY WOULD BE SEPARATED 
FROM THEIR FAMILY. 
THIS IS NOT A CONTROVERSIAL 
IDEA. 
SECOND, CHILDREN IN DHS AND HHS 
CUSTODY ARE BEING WELL TAKEN 
CARE OF. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND 
HUMAN SERVICES OFFICE OF 
REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT PROVIDES 
MEALS, MEDICAL CARE AND 
EDUCATIONAL SERVICES TO THESE 
CHILDREN. 
THEY ARE PROVIDED TEMPORARY 
SHELTER AND HHS WORKS HARD TO 
FIND A PARENT, RELATIVE OR 
FOSTER HOME TO CARE FOR THESE 
CHILDREN. 
PARENTS CAN STILL COMMUNICATE 
WITH THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH 
PHONE CALLS AND VIDEO 
CONFERENCING. 
AND A PARENT WHO IS RELEASED 
ROM CUSTODY CAN BE A SPONSOR 
AND ASK HHS TO RELEASE THE 
CHILD BACK INTO THEIR CARE. 
FURTHER, THESE MINORS CAN STILL 
APPLY FOR ASYLUM AND OTHER 
PROTECTIONS UNDER U.S. 
IMMIGRATION LAW IF ELIGIBLE. 
WE TAKE ALLEGATIONS OF 
MISTREATMENT SERIOUSLY AND I 
WANT TO STRESS THIS POINT. 
WE INVESTIGATE, WE HOLD THOSE 
ACCOUNTABLE WHEN AND IF IT 
SHOULD OCCUR. 
WE HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST 
DETENTION STANDARDS IN THE 
COUNTRY. 
CLAIMING THESE CHILDREN AND 
THEIR PARENTS ARE TREATED 
INHUMANELY IS NOT TRUE AND 
COMPLETELY DISRESPECTS THE HARD 
WORKING MEN AND WOMEN AT THE 
OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT. 
THIRD, PARENTS WHO ENTERED 
ILLEGALLY ARE BY DEFINITION 
CRIMINALS. 
ILLEGAL ENTRY IS A CRIME AS 
DETERMINED BY CONGRESS. 
BY ENTERING OUR COUNTRY 
ILLEGALLY, OFTEN IN DANGEROUS 
CIRCUMSTANCES, ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS HAVE PUT THEIR 
CHILDREN AT RISK. 
FOURTH, CVP AND I.C.E. 
OFFICERS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED 
TO CARE FOR MINORS IN THEIR 
CUSTODY. 
DHS AND HHS TREATS ALL 
INDIVIDUALS IN ITS CUSTODY WITH 
DIGNITY AND RESPECT AND 
COMPLIES WITH ALL LAWS AND 
POLICY. 
THIS REINFORCES AND REIRRITATE  
RE-- REITERATES THE BEST 
INTEREST OF THE CHILDREN TO 
INCLUDE STANDARDS FOR THE 
TRANSPORT AND TREATMENT OF 
MINORS IN DHS AND HHS CUSTODY. 
ADDITIONALLY, ALL U.S. BORDER 
PATROL PERSONNEL ON THE 
SOUTHWEST BORDER ARE BILING 
WARM, EVERY LAST ONE OF -- 
BILINGUAL, EVERY LAST ONE OF 
THEM. 
THEY ARE TO PROVIDE DETAINEES 
WITH WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION IN 
BOTH SPANISH AND ENGLISH THAT 
LAYS OUT THE PROCESS AND 
APPROPRIATE PHONE NUMBERS TO 
CONTACT. 
FINALLY, DHS IS NOT SEPARATING 
FAMILIES LEGITIMATELY SEEKING 
ASYLUM AT PORTS OF ENTRY. 
IF AN ADULT ENTERS AT A PORT OF 
ENTRY AND CLAIMS ASYLUM, THEY 
WILL NOT FACE PROSECUTION FOR 
ILLEGAL ENTRY. 
THEY HAVE NOT COMMITTED A CRIME 
BY COMING TO THE PORT OF ENTRY. 
AS I MENTIONED, DHS DOES HAVE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT 
MINORS AND IN THAT CASE AS WELL 
WE WILL ONLY SEPARATE THE 
FAMILY IF WE CANNOT DETERMINE 
THERE IS A FAMILIAR 
RELATIONSHIP, IF THE CHILD MAY 
BE AT RISK WITH THE PARENT OR 
LEGAL GUARDIAN OR IF THE PARENT 
OR LEGAL GUARDIAN IS REFERRED 
FOR PROSECUTION. WE HAVE A DUTY 
TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE. 
DHS IS NO LONGER IGNORING THE 
LAW. 
WE ARE ENFORCING THE LAWS AS 
THEY EXIST ON THE BOOKS. 
AS LONG AS ILLEGAL ENTRY 
REMAINS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE, DHS 
WILL NOT LOOK THE OTHER WAY. 
DHS WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE 
LAWS ENACTED BY CONGRESS AS WE 
ARE SWORN TO DO. 
AS I SAID EARLIER TODAY, SURELY 
IT IS THE BEGINNING OF THE 
UNRAVELING OF DEMOCRACY WHEN 
THE BODY WHO MAKES THE LAWS 
INSTEAD OF CHANGING THEM TELLS 
THE ENFORCEMENT BODY NOT TO 
ENFORCE THE LAW. 
I ASK CONGRESS TO ACT THIS WEEK 
SO THAT WE CAN SECURE OUR 
BORDERS AND UPHOLD OUR 
HUMANITARIAN IDEAS. 
THESE TWO MISSIONS SHOULD NOT 
BE PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER. 
IF WE CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES, WE 
CAN ACCOMPLISH BOTH. 
BEFORE I TAKE QUESTIONS, I JUST 
WANT TO ASK IN YOUR REPORTING 
PLEASE CONSIDER THE MEN AND 
WOMEN OF DHS WHO ARE DEDICATED 
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND 
WHO OFTEN PUT THEIR LIVES AT 
RISK. 
LET'S REMEMBER THEIR SACRIFICE 
AND COMMITMENT TO THIS COUNTRY. 
WITH THAT I'LL TAKE SOME 
QUESTIONS. 
YES. 
>> Reporter:  SECRETARY, IF YOU 
COULD, WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT 
THERE, DHS IS NO LONGER 
IGNORING THE LAW. 
YOU'RE CALLING ON CONGRESS TO 
CHANGE THE LAW. 
>> YES. 
>> Reporter:  THAT IS THE BIG 
MESSAGE HERE. 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE SAY THAT YOU'RE 
USING CHILDREN AS A LEVER TO 
TRY TO GET THEM TO TAKE 
LEGISLATIVE ACTION. 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? 
>> I SAY THAT'S A VERY COWARDLY 
RESPONSE. 
IT'S CLEARLY WITHIN THEIR  
POWER TO MAKE THE LAWS AND 
CHANGE THE LAWS. 
THEY SHOULD DO SO. 
>>Reporter:  HAVE YOU SEEN THE 
PHOTOS OF CHILDREN IN CAGES? 
HAVE YOU HEARD THE AUDIO CLIP 
OF THESE CHILDREN WAILING THAT 
JUST CAME OUT TODAY? 
>> I HAVE NOT SEEN SOMETHING 
THAT CAME OUT TODAY, BUT I HAVE 
BEEN TO DETENTION CENTERS AND 
AGAIN I WOULD REFERENCE YOU TO 
OUR STANDARDS AND THE CARE 
PROVIDED NOT JUST BY THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
BUT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 
AND HUMAN SERVICES WHEN THEY 
GET TO HHS. 
>> Reporter:  IS THAT THE IMAGE 
OF THIS COUNTRY THAT YOU WANT 
OUT THERE, CHILDREN -- 
>> THE IMAGE THAT I WANT OF 
THIS COUNTRY IS AN IMMIGRATION 
SYSTEM THAT SECURES OUR BORDERS 
AND UPHOLDS OUR HUMANITARIAN 
IDEALS. 
CONGRESS NEEDS TO FIX IT. 
YES. 
>> Reporter:  I'D LIKE TO GIVE 
YOU A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO 
LAURA BUSH IN AN OP ED. 
SHE SAID THIS IS CRUEL. 
SHE SUPPORTS AN APPLICATION OF 
THE LAW EVEN THOUGH THE FIRST 
FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP HAS 
SAID WE SHOULD BE A NATION OF 
LAWS. 
WE SHOULD DO SO WITH HEART. 
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT 
TO TELL THEM? 
DO YOU BELIEVE THEY'RE 
MISUNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION 
OR DO YOU BELIEVE THERE'S ANY 
COMPONENT OF THIS POLICY WHICH 
AS YOU'VE OUTLINED OTHER 
ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE DONE, BUT 
YOU'RE USING IN A WAY THAT IS 
MORE INTENSE AND CREATES THE 
SEPARATION ISSUE? 
>> WHAT MY RESPONSE WOULD BE IS 
CALLING ATTENTION TO THIS 
MATTER IS IMPORTANT. 
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE 
THAT HAS RESULTED AFTER YEARS 
AND YEARS OF CONGRESS NOT 
TAKING ACTION. 
SO I WOULD THANK THEM BOTH FOR 
THEIR COMMENTS AND CONCERNS. 
I SHARE THEIR CONCERNS, BUT 
CONGRESS IS THE ONE THAT NEEDS 
TO FIX THIS. 
>> Reporter:  THE POLICY IS NOT 
BY YOUR DEFINITION IN ANY WAY 
CRUEL? 
>> IT'S NOT A POLICY. 
OUR POLICY AT DHS IS TO DO WHAT 
WE'RE SWORN TO DO, WHICH IS TO 
ENFORCE THE LAW. 
YES. 
>> Reporter:  FOLLOWING UP ON 
MAJOR'S QUESTION THERE FORMER 
FIRST LADY MAJOR BUSH COMPARED 
THIS TO JAPANESE INTERMENT 
DURING WORLD WAR II. 
DO YOU BELIEVE THE EFFECT OF 
THE LAW OF SEPARATING CHILDREN 
FROM FAMILIES IS MORAL, IS 
ETHICAL, IS AMERICAN? 
>> WHAT I BELIEVE IS THAT WE 
SHOULD EXERCISE OUR DEMOCRATIC 
RIGHTS AS AMERICANS AND FIX THE 
PROBLEM. 
IT'S A PROBLEM. 
LET'S FIX IT. 
YES. 
>> Reporter:  HOW IS THIS NOT 
CHILD ABUSE? 
>> BE MORE SPECIFIC, PLEASE, 
ENFORCING THE LAW? 
>> Reporter:  THE IMAGES 
CECILIA WAS TALKING ABOUT AND 
THE SOUNDS WE'VE SEEN FROM 
THESE BIG BOX STORES. 
WHEN YOU SEE THIS, HOW IS THIS 
NOT SPECIFICALLY CHILD ABUSE 
FOR THESE INNOCENT CHILDREN WHO 
ARE INDEED BEING SEPARATED FROM 
THEIR PARENTS? 
>> SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON A 
COUPLE OTHER THINGS. 
THE VAST MAJORITY, VAST, VAST 
MAJORITY OF CHILDREN WHO ARE IN 
THE CARE OF HHS RIGHT NOW, 
10,000 OF THE 12,000, WERE SENT 
HERE ALONE BY THEIR PARENTS. 
THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE 
SEPARATED. 
SO SOMEHOW WE'VE CONFLATED 
EVERYTHING, BUT THERE'S TWO 
SEPARATE ISSUES. 
10,000 OF THOSE CURRENTLY IN 
CUSTODY WERE SENT BY THEIR 
PARENTS WITH STRANGERS TO 
UNDERTAKE A COMPLETELY 
DANGEROUS AND DEADLY TRAVEL 
ALONE. 
WE NOW CARE FOR THEM. 
WE HAVE HIGH STANDARDS. 
WE GIVE THEM MEALS. 
WE GIVE THEM EDUCATION. 
WE GIVE THEM MEDICAL CARE. 
THERE IS VIDEOS. 
THERE'S TVs. 
I VISITED THE DETENTION CENTERS 
MYSELF. 
THAT WOULD BE MY ANSWER TO THAT 
QUESTION. 
YES. 
>> Reporter:  IF I COULD FOLLOW 
UP, FOR THE HUNDREDS NOT 
INCLUDED, YOU SAID 10,000, BUT 
FOR THE HUNDREDS WE HAVE SEEN, 
PERHAPS UP TO 2,000, ARE THERE 
ANY EXAMPLES OF CHILD ABUSE YOU 
BELIEVE AND HOW COULD THIS NOT 
BE CHILD ABUSE FOR THE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE TAKEN FROM THEIR 
PARENTS, NOT THE ONES WHO ARE 
SENT HERE WITH THEIR PARENTS' 
BLESSING WITH THE SMUGGLER, THE 
PEOPLE TAKEN FROM THEIR 
PARENTS? 
>> UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT IN ANY 
POSITION TO DEAL WITH HEARSAY 
STORIES. 
IF SOMEONE HAS A SPECIFIC 
ALLEGATION, AS I ALWAYS DO WHEN 
I TESTIFY, I ASK THEY PROVIDE 
THAT INFORMATION TO THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY. 
WE WILL LOOK INTO IT. 
OF COURSE, WE DO NOT WANT ANY 
SITUATION WHERE A CHILD IS NOT 
COMPLETELY ADEQUATELY TAKEN 
CARE OF. 
YES. 
>> Reporter:  A COUPLE 
QUESTIONS OF ONE, WHY IS THE 
GOVERNMENT ONLY RELEASING 
IMAGES OF THE BOYS WHO ARE 
BEING HELD? 
WHERE ARE THE GIRLS? 
WHERE ARE THE YOUNG TODDLERS? 
>> I DON'T KNOW. 
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THOSE 
PARTICULAR IMAGES. 
>> Reporter:  DO YOU KNOW WHERE 
THE GIRLS ARE? 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE YOUNG ÃºTO 
>> WE HAVE CHILDREN IN DHS CARE 
BOTH, BUT AS YOU KNOW, MOST OF 
THE CHILDREN AFTER 72 HOURS ARE 
TRANSFERRED TO HHS. 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT PICTURES 
YOU'RE REFERENCING, BUT I'D 
HAVE TO REFER YOU TO HHS. 
>> Reporter:  WE'VE SEEN THE 
BOYS, BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY 
OF THE GIRLS AND YOUNG TODDLERS 
AND YOU'RE SAYING THEY'RE WELL 
CARED FOR. 
HOW CAN YOU MAKE THAT CLAIM IF 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE? 
>> IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T KNOW 
WHERE THEY ARE. 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHILDREN Ãº 
SERVICES. 
WE TRANSFER THEM AFTER 72 
HOURS. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT PICTURES 
YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT. 
>> Reporter:  THEY'VE BEEN 
RELEASED ALL OVER. 
>> FROM DHS OR HHS? 
>> Reporter:  SOMETHING YOUR 
DEPARTMENT DID AIRED THROUGHOUT 
NATIONAL TELEVISION THROUGHOUT 
THE DAY, THE KIDS HELD IN CAGES 
AND WE'VE ONLY SEEN THE BOYS. 
>> I WILL LOOK INTO THAT. 
I'M NOT AWARE THERE'S ANOTHER 
PICTURE. 
>> Reporter:  LET ME JUST 
FOLLOW UP BECAUSE YOU CONTINUE 
TO INSIST THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT CONGRESS CAN CHANGE. 
>> YES. 
>> Reporter:  THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT WAS ENACTED AFTER THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ANNOUNCED THE 
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY. 
THIS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE HE 
ANNOUNCED IT. 
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TRUE. 
THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION ALL SEPARATED 
FAMILIES AT THE -- THEY 
ABSOLUTELY DID. 
THEIR RATE WAS LESS THAN OURS, 
BUT THEY ABSOLUTELY DID DO 
THIS. 
THIS IS NOT NEW. 
>> Reporter:  THEY SEPARATED 
MINORS, THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT 
THAT, BUT SEPARATING KIDS AT 
THIS RATE FROM THEIR PARENTS IS 
SOMETHING NEW AND SPECIFIC TO 
THIS ADMINISTRATION ONCE THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ANNOUNCED ZERO 
TOLERANCE POLICY. 
WHY DOESN'T THE PRESIDENT PICK 
UP THE PHONE AND CHANGE THE 
POLICY? 
HE SAID HE HATES IT. 
>> I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
IS TRYING TO DO IS FIND A LONG 
TERM FIX. 
WHY DON'T WE HAVE CONGRESS 
CHANGE THE LAWS. 
NO. 
CONGRESS COULD FIX THIS 
TOMORROW. 
YES. 
I THINK YOU WERE NEXT. 
>> Reporter:  PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAS HAD A LOT TO SAY THE LAST 
FEW DAYS ABOUT IMMIGRATION, BUT 
HE'S OFFERED NO COMPASSION TO 
THE FAMILIES THAT ARE SEPARATED 
AT THE BORDER. 
DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS AND WHY 
WON'T HE SIMPLY PAUSE YOUR 
DEPARTMENT'S ENFORCEMENT OF 
THIS ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
UNTIL CONGRESS REACHES THAT 
LONG TERM FIX SO THAT THESE 
FAMILIES CAN BE REUNITED? 
>> HE HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO 
WORK WITH CONGRESS SINCE HE'S 
BEEN IN OFFICE. 
HE'S MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE 
WILL ENFORCE THE LAWS OF THE 
UNITED STATES AS LONG AS THIS 
ADMINISTRATION IS HERE. 
AS PART OF THAT, HE HAS 
CONTINUALLY REACHED OUT TO 
CONGRESS TO FIX THIS AND I 
THINK WHAT YOU'VE SEEN HIM DO 
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS IS THAT, 
IS CONTINUE TO TELL CONGRESS 
PLEASE WORK WITH US. 
THIS SYSTEM IS BROKEN. 
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT BENEFIT 
FROM THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW ARE 
THE SMUGGLERS, THE TRAFFICKERS, 
THOSE WHO ARE PEDDLING DRUGS 
AND TERRORISTS. 
SO LET'S FIX THE SYSTEM. 
YES. 
>> Reporter:  THAT DIDN'T 
ANSWER THE QUESTION, MA'AM. 
DOES HE FEEL ANY COMPASSION FOR 
THE FAMILIES THAT ARE BEING 
SEPARATED? 
HE HAS TALKED ABOUT THE PARENTS 
BEING POSSIBLE CRIMINALS. 
HE HAS BLAMED IT ON DEMOCRATS. 
HE'S OFFERED NO WORDS OF 
COMPASSION. 
>> I THINK HE HAS SAID IN 
TWEETS THAT HE WOULD LIKE 
CONGRESS TO ACT TO END THE 
UNDERLYING LAWS THAT REQUIRE 
THE SEPARATION. 
YES. 
>> Reporter:  MADAM SECRETARY, 
IT SEEMED LIKE A COUPLE DAYS 
AGO BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND YOUR 
DEFEATS THE MAIN POSTURE POINT 
WAS TO SAY THIS IS NOT THE 
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY, BUT IT 
SEEMS LIKE TODAY THE MESSAGE IS 
A LITTLE DIFFERENT AS TO SAY 
THIS IS OUR POLICY, BUT IT'S 
OUR POLICY BECAUSE EITHER WE 
BELIEVE IT'S A DETERRENT OR WE 
DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE THE 
RESOURCES TO MOVE FAMILIES 
ENTIRELY. 
I'M JUST WONDERING, I WANT TO 
MAKE SURE WE GET IT REPORTED 
RIGHT. 
WHICH OF THOSE IS THE MOST 
PRECISE WAY TO DESCRIBE HOW THE 
ADMINISTRATION FEELS AND GIVEN 
THE BLOWBACK BY A NUMBER OF 
REPUBLICANS AS WELL AS 
DEMOCRATS ARE YOU CONSIDERING 
RETHINKING THIS BASED ON 
FEEDBACK OR IS THIS THE 
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY GOING 
FORWARD, PERIOD, PARAGRAPH? 
>> THE LAWS PROHIBIT US FROM 
DETAINING FAMILIES WHILE THEY 
GO THROUGH PROSECUTION FOR 
ILLEGALLY ENTERING THE BORDER 
AND WHILE THEY GO THROUGH 
PROSECUTIONS FOR IMMIGRATION 
PROCEEDINGS. 
IF WE CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES, WE 
CAN KEEP THE FAMILIES TOGETHER, 
WHICH IS WHAT THEY DID IN THE 
LAST ADMINISTRATION UNTIL A 
COURT RULED THAT WE CAN NO 
LONGER DO THAT. 
AFTER 20 DAYS WE HAVE TO 
RELEASE BOTH UNACCOMPANIED 
CHILDREN AND ACCOMPANIED 
CHILDREN WHICH MEANS THAT WE 
CANNOT DETAIN FAMILIES 
TOGETHER. 
THE ONLY OPTION IS TO NOT 
ENFORCE THE LAW AT ALL. 
YES. 
>> Reporter:  SO GOING BACK TO 
THESE TWO QUESTIONS, YOU SAID 
THAT YOU WANT CONGRESS TO CLOSE 
SOME LOOPHOLES. 
WITH THAT YOU ALSO SAID THAT 
YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS WORK. 
NOW ARE THESE KIDS BEING USED 
AS PAWNS FOR A WALL? 
MANY PEOPLE ARE ASKING THAT AND 
DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING THIS IS 
YOUR DISCRETION AND THERE IS NO 
LAW THAT SAYS THAT THIS WHITE 
HOUSE CAN SEPARATE PARENTS FROM 
THEIR CHILDREN. 
>> THE KIDS ARE BEING USED AS 
PAWNS BY THE SMUGGLERS AND THE 
TRAFFICKERS. 
LET'S JUST PAUSE TO THINK ABOUT 
THIS STATISTIC. 
314% INCREASE IN ADULTS SHOWING 
UP WITH KIDS THAT ARE NOT A 
FAMILY UNIT. 
THOSE ARE TRAFFICKERS. 
THOSE ARE SMUGGLERS. 
THAT IS MS-13. 
THOSE ARE CRIMINALS. 
THOSE ARE ABUSERS. 
>> Reporter:  LET HER FINISH. 
>> THANK YOU. 
ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY IS 
CLOSING THAT LOOPHOLE WILL 
ENABLE US TO DETAIN FAMILIES 
TOGETHER THROUGHOUT THE 
PROCEEDING AS THEY'VE DONE IN 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS. 
>> Reporter:  MADAM SECRETARY, 
DID YOU DEFINITIVELY SAY ARE 
THE CHILDREN BEING USED AS 
PAWNS FOR A WALL? 
CAN YOU SAY YES OR NO TO THAT? 
>> THE CHILDREN ARE NOT BEING 
USED AS A PAWN. 
WE ARE TRYING TO PROTECT THE 
CHILDREN, WHICH IS WHY I'M 
ASKING CONGRESS TO ACT. 
YES. 
>> Reporter:  AS THE LEGAL 
FRAMEWORK FOR THE DECISION YOUR 
ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE, ARE 
WHAT WE'RE SEEING, THE 
PICTURES, THE AUDIOS, THE 
STORIES, ARE THEY AN INTENDED 
CONSEQUENCE OF THE 
ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION 
MAKING OR AN UNINTENDED 
CONSEQUENCE? 
>> I THINK THAT THEY REFLECT 
THE FOCUS OF THOSE WHO POST 
SUCH PICTURES AND NARRATIVES. 
THE NARRATIVES WE DON'T SEE ARE 
THE NARRATIVES OF THE CRIME, OF 
THE OPIOIDS, OF THE SMUGGLERS, 
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE KILLED BY 
GANG MEMBERS, OF AMERICAN 
CHILDREN WHO ARE RECRUITED AND 
THEN WHEN THEY LOSE THE DRUGS, 
THEY'RE TASED AND BEATEN. 
WE DON'T HAVE A BALANCED VIEW 
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING, BUT WHAT'S 
HAPPENING AT THE BORDER IS THE 
BORDER IS BEING OVERRUN BY 
THOSE WHO HAVE NO RIGHT TO 
CROSS IT. 
AS I SAID BEFORE, IF YOU'RE 
SEEKING ASYLUM, GO TO A PORT OF 
ENTRY. 
YOU DO NOT NEED TO BREAK THE 
LAW OF THE UNITED STATES TO 
SEEK ASYLUM. 
>> Reporter:  THERE ARE MORE 
PEOPLE TURNED AWAY FROM PORTS 
OF ENTRY. 
>> THAT ACTUALLY IS INCORRECT. 
WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES. 
WE HAVE MULTIPLE MISSIONS AT 
CBP AND WHAT WE DO IS BASED ON 
THE VERY HIGH STANDARDS WE 
HAVE, IF WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH 
BED SPACE, IF WE DO NOT HAVE 
ENOUGH MEDICAL PERSONNEL ON 
STAFF, IF WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH 
CARETAKERS ON STAFF, THEN WE 
WILL TELL PEOPLE THAT COME TO 
THE BORDER THEY NEED TO COME 
BACK. 
WE ARE NOT TURNING THEM AWAY. 
WE ARE SAYING WE WANT TO TAKE 
CARE OF YOU IN THE RIGHT WAY. 
RIGHT NOW WE DO NOT HAVE THE 
RESOURCES AT THIS PARTICULAR 
MOMENT IN TIME. 
COME BACK. 
 
>> Reporter:  ARE YOU INTENDING 
FOR THIS TO PLAY OUT AS IT IS 
PLAYING OUT? 
ARE YOU INTENDING FOR PARENTS 
TO BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR 
CHILDREN? 
ARE YOU SPENDING TO SEND A 
MESSAGE? 
>> I FIND THAT OFFENSIVE. 
NO BECAUSE WHY WOULD I EVER 
CREATE A POLICY THAT PURPOSELY 
DOES THAT? 
>> Reporter:  PERHAPS AS A 
DETERRENT. 
>> NO. 
THE WAY THAT IT WORKS -- 
>> Reporter:  YOU SAID IT WAS A 
DETERRENT. 
>> THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION THAT 
YOU ASKED ME, BUT THE ANSWER IS 
IT'S A LAW PASSED BY THE UNITED 
STATES CONGRESS. 
RATHER THAN FIXING THE LAW, 
CONGRESS IS ASKING THOSE OF US 
WHO ENFORCE THE LAW TO TURN OUR 
BACKS ON THE LAW AND NOT 
ENFORCE THE LAW. 
IT'S NOT AN ANSWER. 
THE ANSWER IS TO FIX THE LAWS. 
>> Reporter:  WILL THE 
ADMINISTRATION REFRAIN FROM ITS 
CURRENT POLICY IF CONGRESS WERE 
TO PASS SOMETHING THAT'S CLOSE 
TO WHAT YOU WANT OR WILL IT 
CONTINUE TO REQUIRE THE 
THEIR CHILDREN UNTIL THE M -
PRESIDENT GETS EXACTLY WHAT HE 
WANTS? 
>> IF CONGRESS CLOSES THE 
LOOPHOLES, MANY OF WHICH ARE 
CLOSED IN THE TWO BILLS THAT WE 
HOPE ARE TAKEN UP THIS WEEK BY 
THE HOUSE, THEN THEY CLOSE THE 
LOOPHOLES AND THE FAMILIES WILL 
STAY TOGETHER THROUGHOUT THE 
PROCEEDINGS. 
THANK YOU. 
 
>> THANK YOU, SECRETARY 
NIELSEN. 
I'LL JUMP RIGHT IN AND GO TO 
OTHER QUESTIONS, NEWS OF THE 
DAY. 
STEVE. 
>> Reporter:  THE PRESIDENT 
SAID HE WOULD TALK TO THE NORTH 
KOREAN LEADER KIM YESTERDAY. 
DO YOU KNOW IF THAT HAPPENED? 
>> I KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS 
SPOKEN WITH A NUMBER OF 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS THAT 
ARE WORKING ON THE DETAILS 
FOLLOWING THE NORTH KOREAN 
SUMMIT AND WE'LL KEEP YOU 
POSTED ON THOSE DETAILS, BUT 
I'M NOT AWARE OF A SPECIFIC 
CALL BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS AT 
THIS TIME. 
>> Reporter:  THERE'S A REPORT 
THAT THE UNITED STATES AND 
SOUTH KOREA HAVE AGREED TO 
SUSPEND JOINT MILITARY DRILLS 
IN AUGUST. 
IS THAT REAL? 
>> I'M SORRY, THE LAST PART OF 
THE QUESTION? 
>> Reporter:  THAT THEY AGREED 
TO SUSPEND JOINT MILITARY 
DRILLS IN AUGUST. 
ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS? 
>> THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE 
ONGOING AT THIS POINT. 
AS LONG AS THE NORTH KOREANS 
CONTINUE TO ACT IN GOOD FAITH, 
AS WE SAW IN SINGAPORE, THEN WE 
EXPECT THOSE THINGS TO BE ON 
PAUSE. 
>> Reporter:  SARAH, HAS THE 
PRESIDENT DISCUSSED THE FAMILY 
SEPARATION POLICY WITH THE 
FIRST LADY IN LIGHT OF HER 
STATEMENT YESTERDAY AND DOES HE 
HAVE ANY PLANS TO COME OUT AND 
ADDRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, 
MAYBE TAKE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT 
HOW HIS ADMINISTRATION'S 
ENFORCING THE POLICY? 
>> THE PRESIDENT DID TAKE A 
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS, AS I'M 
SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE ON 
FRIDAY, IN WHICH WHAT HE 
ACTUALLY SAID VERY CLOSELY 
MIRRORED WHAT THE FIRST LADY 
SAID. 
HE SAID HE HATES SEEING THIS. 
HE'S CALLED ON CONGRESS, NOT 
JUST FRIDAY, BUT FOR MONTHS 
HE'S CALLED ON DEMOCRATS IN 
CONGRESS TO WORK WITH HIM. 
LET'S FIX THIS PROBLEM. 
THE PRESIDENT ISN'T TRYING TO 
KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. 
HE'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO WORK 
WITH CONGRESS TO GET REAL 
SOLUTIONS AND TO FIX THE 
PROBLEM. 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. 
JEFF, I'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTION 
SINCE YOU AND YOUR NETWORK 
FALSELY ACCUSED ME OF NOT 
WANTING TO BE HERE. 
SO I'LL BE GLAD TO PASS THAT 
QUESTION ON TO YOU NOW. 
>> Reporter:  WHY DID YOU 
DECIDE TO HAVE SECRETARY 
NIELSEN ANSWER QUESTIONS 
INSTEAD OF YOU? 
>> I'M HERE ANSWERING QUESTIONS 
AS WELL, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS 
IMPORTANT FOR THE SECRETARY IN 
ONE OF THE PRIMARY -- AND ONE 
OF THE PRIMARY EXPERTS ON THE 
PROCESS AND THE THINGS GOING ON 
TO COME OUT AND HAVE THE CHANCE 
TO SPEAK TO YOU AND FOR YOU 
GUYS TO BE ABLE TO ASK 
QUESTIONS DIRECTLY OF HER AND 
THE LEADERS IN THIS 
ADMINISTRATION, BUT I'M 
STANDING HERE IN FRONT OF YOU. 
JOHN. 
>> Reporter:  I HAVE A REAL 
QUESTION. 
WOULD THE PRESIDENT SIGN A BILL 
THAT DID NOT INCLUDE BORDER 
FUNDING IF IT DID INDEED CLOSE 
THIS LOOPHOLE THAT SECRETARY 
NIELSEN TALKED ABOUT? 
WOULD HE SIGN THAT SPECIFIC 
BILL OR DOES HE REQUIRE AN 
ENTIRE BILL WITH THAT $25 
BILLION? 
>> WHAT WE'VE LAID OUT WHAT WE 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE ON A NUMBER 
OF DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, THERE 
ARE CURRENTLY TWO BILLS THAT 
ARE IN PROCESS IN THE HOUSE. 
THE PRESIDENT SUPPORTS BOTH OF 
THOSE PIECES OF LEGISLATION 
THAT WE HAVE VOICED SUPPORT FOR 
THE DETAILS IN THOSE. 
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T JUST WANT 
TO SEE A BAND AID PUT ON THIS. 
HE WANTS US TO ACTUALLY FIX OUR 
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. 
HE'S TIRED OF ADMINISTRATIONS 
CLAIMING THEY WANT TO HELP THE 
SYSTEM AND KICKING THE CAN DOWN 
THE ROAD. 
ISM WANTS TO ACTUALLY FIX THE 
PROBLEMS -- HE WANTS TO 
ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEMS AND 
SECURE OUR BORDER. 
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING WE CAN 
TINKER WITH. 
WE'VE LAID OUT WHAT WE WANT TO 
SEE IN LEGISLATION. 
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO FIX THE 
SYSTEM. 
WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT. 
WE HOPE CONGRESS WILL DO THEIR 
PARTS. 
DEMOCRATS HAVE GOT TO STOP 
PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES AND 
ACTUALLY COME TO THE TABLE AND 
GET REAL ABOUT SOLVING THE 
PROBLEM. 
JOHN. 
>> Reporter:  ON THE IG REPORT 
AND THE HEARINGS IN CONGRESS 
WITH MR. HOROWITZ AND DIRECTOR 
WRAY, THE PRESIDENT TWEETED 
SEVERAL TIMES TODAY AND 
YESTERDAY THAT THE MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION CONTINUES TO BE A 
"WITCH HUNT," AND HE SAID 
FRIDAY AFTER REVIEWING THE IG 
REPORT IT SHOWS THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION. 
HIS OWN FBI DIRECTOR TODAY SAID 
THAT MUELLER IS NOT ON A WITCH 
HUNT AND THAT THE REPORT 
DOESN'T SPEAK TO THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION. 
HOW IS THERE THAT DISCONNECT 
THERE BETWEEN WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT BELIEVES ANOTHER 
BRANCH OF HIS ADMINISTRATION IS 
DOING? 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
CLEAR. 
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY INVOLVED 
IN HIS CAMPAIGN AND HE'S LAID 
OUT A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT 
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION AND HE 
STRONGLY FEELS THIS IS A WIND  
-- WHICH HUNT. 
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID THE IG 
REPORT CLEARLY CALLS INTO 
QUESTION THE CREDIBILITY OF 
JAMES COMEY AND OTHER SENIOR 
FBI INVESTIGATORS INVOLVED IN 
THE INVESTIGATION. 
>>> THE GOVERNOR OF 
MASSACHUSETTS WHO IS A 
REPUBLICAN TODAY REVERSED 
COURSE AND ORDERED THE NATIONAL 
GUARD NOT TO SEND ASSETS OR 
PERSONNEL TO THE SOUTHWEST 
BORDER BECAUSE HE SAID ACTIONS 
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE 
RESULTING IN THE INHUMANE 
TREATMENT OF CHILDREN. 
WOULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT AND 
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OTHER IMPACT 
ON BORDER OPERATIONS FROM THIS 
WHOLE SITUATION? 
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN HIS COMMENT 
SPECIFICALLY, BUT I WOULD TELL 
HIM THAT HE SHOULD CALL EVERY 
MEMBER OF CONGRESS, 
PARTICULARLY THOSE IN HIS OWN 
STATE, AND ASK THEM TO FIX THE 
LAWS. 
THERE'S ONLY ONE BODY HERE THAT 
GETS TO CREATE LEGISLATION AND 
IT'S CONGRESS. 
OUR JOB IS TO ENFORCE IT AND WE 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE CONGRESS FIX 
IT. 
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS 
REPEATEDLY CALLED ON THEM TO 
WORK WITH HIM TO DO JUST THAT. 
DEBRA? 
>> Reporter:  WHAT WAS THE 
PRESIDENT'S REACTION TO LAURA 
BUSH'S PIECE IN THE WASHINGTON 
POST? 
>> I'M SORRY? 
WHAT WAS THE LAST PART OF YOUR 
QUESTION? 
>> Reporter:  WHAT WAS THE 
PRESIDENT'S REACTION TO LAURA 
BUSH'S PIECE IN THE WASHINGTON 
POST? 
>> I DIDN'T SPEAK DIRECTLY WITH 
HIM ABOUT THAT, BUT I'M HAPPY 
TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND 
ECHO WHAT SECRETARY NIELSEN 
SAID. 
LOOK, WE SHERYL THE CONCERN. 
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF SAID -- 
SHARE THE CONCERN. 
THE PRESIDET HIMSELF SAID THAT 
HE DOESN'T LIKE THIS PROCESS, 
BUT ONCE AGAIN IT'S CONGRESS' 
JOB TO CHANGE THE LAW. 
WE'RE CALLING ON THEM TO DO 
EXACTLY THAT AND FRANKLY, THIS 
LAW WAS ACTUALLY SIGNED INTO 
EFFECT IN 2008 UNDER HER 
HUSBAND'S LEADERSHIP, NOT UNDER 
THIS ADMINISTRATION. 
WE'RE NOT THE ONES RESPONSIBLE 
FOR CREATING THIS PROBLEM. 
WE'VE INHERITED IT, BUT WE'RE 
ACTUALLY THE FIRST 
ADMINISTRATION STEPPING UP AND 
TRYING TO FIX IT. 
JOHN. 
>> Reporter:  THANK YOU, SARAH. 
I HAVE HERE IN MY HANDS FIGURES 
FROM THE GERMAN MINISTRY OF THE 
INTERIOR UNDER MINISTER 
SEEHOFER WHICH SAYS CRIME HAS 
GONE DOWN 5.1% IN GERMANY. 
IN FACT, IT'S THE LOWEST REPORT 
IN A QUARTER CENTURY IN 
GERMANY. 
VIOLENT CRIME IS DOWN 2.4%, 
BURGLARY DOWN 23% AND THEFT 
DOWN 11.8%. 
WHERE DID THE PRESIDENT GET THE 
STATEMENT THAT CRIME WAS WAY UP 
IN GERMANY UNDER THE MERKEL 
PLAN FOR REFUGEES? 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THE REPORT 
YOU'RE REFERENCING, BUT I'LL BE 
HAPPY TO CHECK INTO IT AND 
CIRCLE BACK. 
JOHN. 
>> Reporter:  I READ THE FIRST 
LADY'S STATEMENT THAT WAS PUT 
OUT AND SHE SEEMS VERY TROUBLED 
BY THIS ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY. 
IS THERE ANY SORT OF DAYLIGHT 
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE 
FIRST LADY ON THIS ISSUE? 
>> I THINK WE'VE MADE IT 
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THE 
DAYLIGHT EXISTS BETWEEN 
DEMOCRATS AND CONGRESS AND 
THEIR ABILITY TO CHANGE THIS 
LAW. 
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF SAID THAT 
HE DOESN'T -- HE HATES THESE 
IMAGES. 
HE HATES THIS PROCESS AND 
THAT'S WHY HE'S ASKED FOR IT TO 
BE FIXED. 
I FEEL LIKE WE KEEP IGNORING 
THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT 
ISN'T THE ONE THAT CREATES THE 
LAW, BUT IT'S CONGRESS' JOB TO 
CREATE THE LAW AND THE 
PRESIDENT'S ALREADY LAID OUT 
AND GLADLY STATED A NUMBER OF 
TIMES PUBLICLY THAT HE WOULD 
SIGN LEGISLATION THAT FIXES 
THESE LOOPHOLES AND FIXES OUR 
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. 
I THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE 
BEGGING AND BANGING DOWN THE 
DOORS OF CONGRESS AND ASKING 
THEM TO JOIN WITH THE PRESIDENT 
INSTEAD OF FIGHTING HIM, 
INSTEAD OF CONSTANTLY 
CRITICIZING HIM. 
WHY AREN'T THEY OFFERING 
SOLUTIONS? 
YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE NANCY 
PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER WHO 
COME OUT AND COMPLAIN AND 
ATTACK. 
IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO 
MESSAGE. 
THEY HAVE NO SOLUTIONS. 
WE'VE LAID OUT A SOLUTION AND 
WE'D LIKE TO SEE THEM WORK WITH 
US TO PUT IT IN PLACE. 
STEVE. 
>> Reporter:  ALSO CRITICAL OF 
THIS PARTICULAR POLICY BESIDES 
THE PEOPLE THAT YOU MENTIONED 
ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE ARE A 
NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS AND ALSO 
SOME VERY PROMINENT MEMBERS OF 
SOME OF THE PRESIDENT'S BASE, 
EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS. 
DO YOU KNOW IF THE PRESIDENT 
HAS HEARD FROM THOSE MEMBERS OF 
HIS BASE, EVANGELICALS IN 
PARTICULAR, HAD DISCUSSIONS 
WITH THE PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS 
PARTICULAR POLICY? 
CAN YOU SORT OF FILL US IN ON 
DISCUSSIONS THE PRESIDENT MAY 
HAVE HAD IN THAT REGARD? 
>> I THINK ANY EVANGELICAL OR 
ANY CHURCH, FOR THAT MATTER, 
THAT FEELS STRONGLY, THEY ÃºSHOU 
HELP FACILITATE SOME OF THESE 
INDIVIDUALS. 
I THINK THAT'S THEIR CALLING. 
THAT'S THE MISSION OF THE 
CHURCH AND THEY SHOULD 
CERTAINLY FULFILL THAT. 
IF THEY WANT TO FIX THE 
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, THEN THEY 
SHOULD CALL THEIR MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS AND ASK THEM TO JOIN 
WITH US TO DO THAT. 
STEVE. 
>> Reporter:  THERE'S SOME 
CONFUSION ABOUT THIS SPACE 
FORCE THAT THE PRESIDENT 
ANNOUNCED TODAY. 
DID HE ACTUALLY SIGN ANYTHING? 
DOES HE BELIEVE THAT THIS CAN 
BE DONE WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF 
CONGRESS? 
THE AIR FORCE APPEARS OPPOSED 
TO IT. 
WHERE IS THE SUPPORT FOR THIS 
COMING FROM BESIDES THE 
PRESIDENT? 
>> THE PRESIDENT ASKED THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO START 
THE PROCESS. 
WE'RE IN THE BEGINNING STAGES 
OF IT. 
WE'LL WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT 
OF DEFENSE AND THE OTHER 
RELEVANT PARTIES TO PUT IT INTO 
PLACE. 
FRANCESCA. 
>> Reporter:  IF THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS, AS IT SAYS, 
NOT USING THE CHILDREN AS PAWNS 
IN THIS SITUATION, THEN WHY NOT 
JUST HAVE CONGRESS PASS 
LEGISLATION THAT NARROWLY DEALS 
WITH THIS SEPARATION ISSUE AND 
SIGN IT AND THEN DEAL WITH THE 
OTHER ASPECTS OF THE 
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WANTS OVERHAULED AT A 
DIFFERENT TIME? 
>> ONCE AGAIN WE WANT TO FIX 
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. 
WE DON'T WANT TO JUST TINKER 
WITH IT. 
THE PRESIDENT IS TIRED OF 
WATCHING PEOPLE KICK IT DOWN 
THE ROAD AND NOT TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT FIX THE 
PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE. 
>> Reporter:  I GET THE 
FEELING, SARAH, YOU WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE ALL THESE OTHER THINGS 
CHANGED ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION 
SYSTEM, BUT WE'RE DEALING  WITH 
THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION RIGHT 
NOW. 
>> WE'RE DEALING  WITH A NUMBER 
OF SITUATIONS. 
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE. 
WE HAVE PEOPLE FLOODING OVER 
THE BORDERS. 
LOOK, THE PRESIDENT WANTS 
PEOPLE TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY 
BUT LEGALLY AND THROUGH THE 
RIGHT PROCESS. 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING. 
WE WANT TO SECURE THE BORDER. 
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF 
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE 
PERMANENTLY SEPARATED FROM 
THEIR FAMILIES DUE TO THE 
ILLEGAL ALIENS THAT HAVE COME 
ACROSS THIS BORDER AND MURDERED 
AND KILLED AMERICAN CITIZENS. 
WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE OVER THAT 
SEPARATION? 
WE WANT TO FIX THE WHOLE THING. 
WE DON'T WANT TO JUST TINKER 
WITH ONE PART OF IT. 
THIS IS A BROKEN SYSTEM AND 
WE'VE GOT TO QUIT IGNORING IT. 
JUST IGNORING THE RULE DOESN'T 
FIX IT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS 
ADMINISTRATION IS ACTUALLY 
TRYING TO DO. 
I'M GOING TO TAKE ONE LAST 
QUESTION. 
>> Reporter:  THE SECRETARY 
POMPEO CAME OUT TODAY AND HE 
SAID THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR 
DENUCLEARIZATION ON THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA THAT THE UNITED 
STATES HAD UPDATED THE 
ARMISTICE AGREEMENT CURRENTLY 
IN PLACE. 
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT THE 
PRESIDENT DID MAKE THIS 
COMMITMENT TO KIM JONG UN? 
AND WHAT EXACTLY DOES UPDATING 
THE ARMISTICE MEAN? 
DOES IT PUT THE FUTURE OF U.S. 
FORCES ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA 
IN QUESTION AND JUST ANY MORE 
INFORMATION YOU COULD UPDATE US 
ON IN THAT REGARD. 
>> WE'RE FINALIZING THE DETAILS 
OF WHAT THE PROCESS WOULD LOOK 
LIKE, CERTAINLY WOULD CONFIRM 
SECRETARY POMPEO'S COMMENTS AND 
WOULD REFER YOU TO THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT 
OF DEFENSE WHO WILL BE PUTTING 
THOSE DETAILS OUT AND TOGETHER. 
THANKS SO MUCH, GUYS. 
HAVE A GREAT DAY. 
>> WELL, IN AN OP ED HEATED 
PRESS BRIEFING WE'VE JUST HEARD 
FROM WHITE HOUSE PRESS 
SECRETARY SARAH HUCKABEE 
SANDERS AND EARLIER HOMELAND 
SECURITY SECRETARY KIRSTJEN 
NIELSEN ANSWERING REPORTERS' 
QUESTIONS AND DEFENDING THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S  POLICY 
OF SEPARATING PARENTS FROM 
CHILDREN WHO CROSS THE BORDER 
ILLEGALLY. 
THERE'S BEEN A GROWING WAVE OF
