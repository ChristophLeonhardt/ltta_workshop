00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,346
[music]

2
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:14,140
My father, José Perez,
died as an indirect result

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,980
of Hurricane Maria.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,647
He is shoe No. 399.

5
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:26,090
No. 2851.

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,180
My mother, Juanita
Mélendez Betancourt

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,783
died of a heart attack
due to complications

8
00:00:30,783 --> 00:00:32,646
from Hurricane Maria.

9
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:56,330
I cry because it’s hard
to see a system erasing

10
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,620
the pain of the people.

11
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,040
You cannot erase that.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,495
And you have to be respectful
with the dead ones.

13
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,940
Shoe No. 2231.

14
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,260
My grandmother spent Hurricane
Irma and Hurricane Maria

15
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,330
at the hospital.

16
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,320
She was a patient
on hemodialysis.

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,680
In this moment, 2018,
we’re having “desaparecidos,”

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,140
thousand of people who 
are completely disappeared,

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,970
invisible to the system.

20
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,560
We want to make a closure.

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,410
We want to finish.

22
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,350
We want to close that pain.

23
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,902
Jiram Perez — 
shoe No. 2860.

24
00:01:32,902 --> 00:01:36,766
My grandfather passed away
in the horrible aftermath

25
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:38,698
of Hurricane Maria.

26
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:39,670
These are human beings.

27
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,230
They are not just
numbers or statistics.

28
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,110
They have faces.

29
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,400
They lived.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,090
They loved.

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,610
They are gone.

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,881
They are missed.

33
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:52,248
[wind blowing]

34
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,944
We demand the
governor of Puerto Rico

35
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:05,130
to be prepared for the
next hurricane season.

36
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,110
We demand that President Trump
to apologize to the country

37
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,639
of throwing towels.

38
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,700
If you look at a real
catastrophe like Katrina —

39
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,480
16 people versus
in the thousands.

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,660
And not accepting that
we were having thousands

41
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,650
of victims in the island.

42
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,690
I say to the politicians
in the States to be careful,

43
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,840
and to take Puerto
Rican and Puerto Rican

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,400
respect as something serious.

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:00:00,000
We have a vote there
in the States.
