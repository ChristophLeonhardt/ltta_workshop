00:00:00,675 --> 00:00:01,650
“I’m Boots Riley.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,790
I’m the writer and director
of "Sorry to Bother You."

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,680
This is our main
telemarketing floor.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,780
Lakeith Stanfield
plays Cassius Green,

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,306
who has recently
discovered a magical power

6
00:00:12,306 --> 00:00:13,680
to make his voice
sound like it’s

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,000
overdubbed by a white actor.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,300
And this is his
first successful sale

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,580
using that white
voice, which disguises

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,220
the fact that he’s actually
black to the callers.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,840
We needed this so that
he could own his success,

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,630
and we could feel
happy for him."

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,110
“Spin Doctors, classic —

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,650
Tim, I want to
chop it up more,

15
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,775
but I got to get
to my squash game.

16
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,810
Was that Visa or Mastercard?"

17
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,870
Narrator: We’re about to see Michael
X. Sommers, as his manager

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,090
Johnny, who
actually only lives

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,960
two blocks away from
where it was shooting.

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,950
He’s local, but I don’t
think he’s going to be local

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,860
very much any more.

22
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,030
He’s a great actor.

23
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,490
And there are two
crazy actors who

24
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,060
this scene shows how great
two crazy people could

25
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,840
be together.

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,190
This is a scene that we had
14 wardrobe changes for.

27
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,650
And it’s the kind of
scene that indie producers

28
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,240
would like to cut out because
it costs a lot of money.

29
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,090
You don’t usually
have stuff like this.

30
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,010
And the question is,
why do you need it?

31
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,158
But we need it because we need
to ride this wave with him."

32
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:18,150
[cheering]

33
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,700
“All movies should have
a high-five montage

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,850
and this one, the music
that’s playing is by my band

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,570
The Coup.

36
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,520
And it’s called, ‘Oh
Yeah All Right Hell Yeah

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,370
That’s Tight.'"

38
00:01:27,370 --> 00:00:00,000
