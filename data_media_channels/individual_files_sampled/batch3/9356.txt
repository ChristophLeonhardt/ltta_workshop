Bret: WE HAVE GOOD NEWS President Trump: WE HAVE GOOD NEWS. PASTOR ANDREW BRUNSON IS IN THE AIR FROM TURKEY. HE'S GOING TO BE COMING TO THE OVAL OFFICE, MOST LIKELY, ON SATURDAY. HE SUFFERED GREATLY, BUT WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF PEEP. THERE WAS NO DEAL MADE. AT ALL. IT'S BEEN A ROLLER COASTER RIDE. WE HAVE BEEN FINDING OUR NEWS OUT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HAS. WE'VE BEEN KIND OF GLUED TO THE NEWS, JUST SEEMS SURREAL WE'VE OVERJOYED BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM REAL. Bret: GREAT NEWS, PASTOR BRUNSON RELEASED FROM TURKEY ON HIS WAY TO THE U.S. IEMGTS BEEN A LONG TIME, TWO YEARS FIVE DAYS AGO HE WAS DETAINED BY TURKISH POLICE WITHOUT CHARGES. TWO MONTHS LATER CHARGED WITH MEMBERSHIP IN AN ARMED TERRORIST ORGANIZATION FOR ALLEGEDLY BACKING A COUP ATTEMPT IN TURKEY, FACED 35 YEARS IN PRISON. JULY TAKEN FROM PRISON, PLAGUED UNDER HOUSE ARREST. IN AUGUST, THE U.S. PUT SANCTIONS ON A COUPLE OF TURKISH OFFICIALS. TODAY, AGAIN, HE IS LEAVING, TIME SERVED, THE SENTENCE. RELEASING A STATEMENT, WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE PRESIDENT'S COMMITMENT AND EFFORTS IN SECURING MY RELEASE. MY FAMILY THANKS THE PRESIDENT, THE ADMINISTRATION, AND CONGRESS FOR THE UNWAVERING SUPPORT. THIS IS THE DAY OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN PRAYING FOR. I'M DELIGHTED TO BE ON MY WAY HOME TO THE UNITED STATES. FINALLY A GOOD 23450US STORY ON A FRIDAY OF A BUSY WEEK. LET'S BRING IN THE PANEL, MATTHEW, KAREN, OPINION WRITER FOR THE "WASHINGTON POST," AND MARK TEESON FELLOW AT AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE. MARK, GOOD NEWS STORY. AND SOUNDS LIKE THE PRESIDENT MAKING CLEAR NO DEAL WAS DONE. ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S HOW HE DOES IT. IT IS A BIG NEWS STORY. THE 17th AMERICAN BY MY COUNT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS FREED FROM FOREIGN CAPTIVITY. FOUR AMERICANS IN NORTH KOREA, AMERICAN AID WORK THEY'RE JIPT, THROUGH UCLA BASKETBALL PLAYERS, AND A TEXAS BUSINESSWOMAN IN CHINA, A CIA, FORMER CIA OFFICIAL IN PR TO YOU GAL, AMERICAN CITIZEN HELD IN VENEZUELA. HE'S DOING INTEREST FAIRLY CONSISTENTLY. HE'S DONE INTEREST NOT BY GIVING BRIBES, NOT BY SENDING PLANE LOADS OF CASH TO FOREIGN REGIMES THAT, CREATES AN INCENTIVE TO TAKE AMERICANS HOSTAGE. HE EXERCISES THE COERCIVE ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC POWER OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HE PUT CRUSHING SANCTIONS ON TURKEY, SENT THE LIRA TUMBLING. TURKEY FOUND A WAY TO GET OUT OF IT. AND THEY HAD ALSO MADE IT, THE ADMINISTRATION MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR THAT, THIS WAS NECESSARY FOR IMPROVING RELATIONS. THE TIMING IS INTERESTING. GIVEN THAT TURKEY HAS ALSO BEEN TURNING OVER A LOT OF INTELLIGENCE ON THE POSSIBLE APPARENT MURDER OF OUR COLLEAGUE, JAMAL KHASHOGGI, FROM THE "WASHINGTON POST." TURKEY COULD BE PLAYING SORT OF A DOUBLE GAME HERE, TO SORT OF POSITION ITSELF IN ITS RIVALRY WITH SAUDI ARABIA. Bret: MATTHEW? THERE ARE REAL ECONOMIC COSTS TO THE CAPTIVITY OF RECEIVE BRUNSON, NO REV. BRUNSON. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S METHOD IS LEVERAGE THE ECONOMIC WEIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST REGIMES DOING NO GOOD. THIS IS A VICTORY, NOT ONLY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION BUT ALSO VICTORY FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. YOU CAN'T FORGET WHY HE WAS IMPRISONED IN THE FIRST PLACE, HIS MINISTRY. A LOT OF CHRISTIAN IS A ROUND THE WORLD APPRECIATE THAT HE'S NOW BEEN RELEASED. Bret: YOU MENTION, KAREN, THE MISSING JOURNALIST, KHASHOGGI. THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT THAT TODAY ON THE TARMAC AS WELL. President Trump: WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO THE TERRIBLE SITUATION IN TURKEY, HAVING TO DO WITH SAUDI ARABIA AND THE REPORTER. A LOT OF RECORDS ARE OVERLOOKED. IF LOOK AT IRAN, SO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES, SYRIA, YOU TAKE A LOOK AT A LOT OF COUNTRIES ARC LOT OF COUNTRIES' RECORDS HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED. I WILL BE CALLING AT SOME POINT KING SALMAN. Bret: WHERE DOES THIS GO? THERE'S REPORTING, MULTIPLE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, SAYING THERE'S U.S. INTELLIGENCE SHOWING THERE ARE INTERCEPTS OR CALLS OR RECORDINGS. TURKISH SAY THEY HAVE HEARD AND SEEN EVIDENCE OF THIS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT BEEN PRIVY TO THAT AS FAR AS WE KNOW, CORRECT? THAT'S RIGHT. AND THE OTHER THING, THOUGH, THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN FROM THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE, THE "WASHINGTON POST" REPORTED, THAT THE CROWN PRINCE HAD, IN FACT, OKAYED AN EARLIER PLAN TO LURE JAMAL KHASHOGGI TO SAUDI ARABIA AND ESSENTIALLY ABDUCT HIM THERE. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF SIGNS, A LOT OF ARROWS, POINTING TO THE VERY TOP, TOP LEVELS OF THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT. Bret: THIS IS HEINOUS, IF IT HAPPENED, AND IF THEY FIND OUT IT HAPPENED IT'S HORRIFIC. FROM PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT REGIMES, AND HOW THEY DEAL WITH THINGS AROUND THE WORLD, IS THERE ANY DAYLIGHT IN DEALING WITH THE REGIME THAT IT TURNS OUT DID THIS? IT'S VERY HARD. THIS IS, I MEAN, BOTH CRIMINAL AND IT'S A BETRAYAL, PERSONAL BETRAYAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS EMBRACED THE CROWN PRINCE. IT WAS HIS FIRST COUNTRY THAT HE VISITED AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE MADE DEALS WITH THEM. HE'S SHIFTED OUR FOREIGN POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AWAY FROM COURTING IRAN AND BRINGING THEM AROUND AND TOWARDS SUPPORTING OUR ALLIES LIKE SAUDI ARABIA AND ISRAEL. HE PUT A LOT ON THE LINE. MBS, IF HE'S BEHIND THIS, BETRAYED PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE UNITED STATES. Bret: MATTHEW. IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THE CROWN PRINCE IS BEHIND IT. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE EVIDENCE YET. EVEN THE PLOT THAT KAREN DESCRIBED IS FAR DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE TURKS ARE ACCUSING THE SAUDIS OF DOING, TORTURING, MURDERING, AND THEN DISMEMBERING HIM IN THE CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL. NOT IN SAUDI ARABIA. I A LOT OF PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL ARE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS AND EVIDENCE. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, THAT THE SAUDI-U.S. ALLIANCE CARRIES GREAT COSTS AND HAS CARRIED GREAT COSTS FOR DECADES F THAT ALLIANCE WERE TO BREAK, THERE WOULD BE COSTS AS WELL. SO, AS WE EVALUATE THE PUNISHMENT, THAT SHOULD BE METED OF THE IF THE CRIME IS PROVEN, WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WHAT THE MIDDLE EAST DOESN'T NEED IS ANOTHER FAILED STATE. Bret: KAREN, LAST WORD? I THINK THAT IT IS INCUMBENT ON US TO, FROM THE UNITED STATES, TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO GET A CLEAR ANSWER. THE SAUDIS ARE SAYING HE LEFT THE CONSULATE.
