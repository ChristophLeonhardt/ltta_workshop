a major motorway bridge has collapsed in the northern Italian city of Genoa sending vehicles plunging 100 metres interior minister Matteo salvini says 30 people are confirmed to have been killed including a child well let's talk now to italian civil engineer alessandro siani Alessandra thank you for coming on the program the structural integrity of the bridge is being blamed for what happened why was it open to traffic if that was the case we know that it had only just undergone maintenance works hello everybody yes looking at the collapse the coast could be great into a structural failure my opinion the problem is looking at the majors the failure was due a brittle fracture all the enforcement concrete this kind of fracture is sudden and highly destructive the bridge probably collapse to the failure or the middle higher of the cable-stayed bridge maintenance of such Domitian piece is highly costly so in my opinion they the works do done for the maintenance where problem is efficient but the problem it was unpredictable on a such greater structure so the final constructor this question would be the problem could be managed by doing an in popular decision that will be probably closed after and rebuilt because the highly cost for maintenance our relief profited for this kind of problem that'll core today we knew it happened during a thunderstorm Alice on a very inclement weather in that particular area between the sea and the mountains Genoa how how could a storm though have such an impact on a concrete structure yes the two events may be probably correlated in fact cable-stayed bridge like the general ones could be highly highly patch on the wheel when is blowing the problem is that the concrete is will be probably already cracked and ready so much and the oscillations do the natural wind blowing equally with the the risk of brittle structural failure that was in my opinion because of this of this failure so yes would be highly correlated that's extraordinary really the a-10 Alessandro is a toll road isn't it what it's maintenance be controlled by the company managing it or by the government my question essentially being who is ultimately responsible and is the Italian government are they investing enough in infrastructure in roads and bridges making them safe enough well the HR Road motor road is pretty much is not homeland from the government in particular the bridge was in the road from Genoa to sivanna that is onand from a private company that is called autostrada pare Italia it is a full private owner in general rule the responsible maintenance and in this case of devane's is the owner of the infrastructure but in Italian in Italy sorry there are also some how to say when the concession of this road was given by the government to this private company it may be hotter deal between the two parties so I can't not buy now buy don't knowing the the real document between the the true parties which is the real responsible in a theoretical natural way could be the owner so I'll just study for Italia but I'm not sure because would be order deals against the true parties okay well thank you very much for coming in the program and sharing your expertise we know you're not very far away from Genoa so we just like to just really send our condolences to that city and the people affected we've been speaking to our son Satomi a civil engineer in northern Italy
