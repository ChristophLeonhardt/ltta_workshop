well there's also been public condemnation in the US with thousands rallying across the country on Sunday in protests against the Syria bombings we spoke to two political commentators who are usually on the opposite sides of the debate about their thoughts on US military action some Trump supporters are disappointed I'm one of them I I like the Trump's position during the election but I think a lot of people on our political left and people like me on the right think we should not be the world's police any longer that was one of the issues and main it points the Trump made during the campaign you know nobody likes to ascribe to any president whatever their political party killing people using munitions like this just as a distraction that said I mean you can't deny that the walls are closing in on Donald Trump legally from the special prosecutor Muller from the United States attorney in New York with his lawyer Cohen so do I think that Donald Trump is that Craven as to launch strikes to distract attention no but the mere fact that it's a question that's troubling I would diminish that he has major issues as just described he has a higher approval rating than did Obama at this time in his presidency in some polls the economy it's not credible jobs are coming back and the economy is growing great yeah well it is it is true in America right now small businesses for the first time are excited if you look at the average of all the polls there's one poll that's been consistently in Donald Trump's Rasmussen in his camp every other poll if you average them out he is at historic lows for any president since the advent of polling in the United States of America and Democrats their complaint is what's the broader plan you say mission accomplished mr. president what's the mission they see this as not pursuant to any particular plan and on the right it seems inconsistent with the the promises the president made during the campaign to withdraw so as a result there's just not a big constituency in favor of what he's done mission accomplished was a popular phrase that turned very notorious with Iraq and look at where we are now listen I I find it interesting you have someone on the left and someone on the right politically in America here on RT and we sort of agree the worst case scenario is Assad gets toppled or killed and then we have another Iraq for the next decade and then we really get engaged in a war because Isis then overwhelms and takes over the country
