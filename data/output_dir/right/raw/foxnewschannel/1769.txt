1
00:00:00,891 --> 00:00:02,159
GOING TO BE A MEDICAL STUDENT

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,627
WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY YOU CAN

3
00:00:03,627 --> 00:00:05,262
PRONOUNCE ALL THOSE WORDS VERY

4
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:05,696
WELL.

5
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:07,097
THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT.

6
00:00:07,097 --> 00:00:09,166
NOW TO OUR OTHER TOP STRIKE OF A

7
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:11,302
HUGE FOREIGN POLICY WEEK FOR THE

8
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:11,869
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

9
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:14,305
HISTORIC OPENING OF U.S. EMBASSY

10
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,539
IN JERUSALEM IS MET WITH VIOLENT

11
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,642
PROTESTS ALONG ISRAEL'S BORDER

12
00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:19,209
WITH GAZA.

13
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:22,313
DOZENS OF PALESTINIANS ARE DEAD,

14
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,047
AND THOUSANDS MORE REPORTEDLY

15
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:23,914
INJURED.

16
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:25,349
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO

17
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:26,717
MOVING FORWARD TO TRY TO

18
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:28,118
DENUCLEARIZE NORTH KOREA.

19
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:29,520
EARLIER IN JERUSALEM, THE

20
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,554
PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THE CROWD

21
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:31,388
WITH A VIDEO MESSAGE PRAISING

22
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:33,924
OUR COUNTRY'S FRIENDS AND ALLIES

23
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:34,525
OUR COUNTRY'S FRIENDS AND ALLIE

24
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:35,893
ALLIES.

25
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:37,594
>> ISRAEL IS A SOVEREIGN NATION

26
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:39,763
WITH THE RIGHT LIKE EVERY OTHER

27
00:00:39,763 --> 00:00:41,332
SOVEREIGN NATION TO DETERMINE

28
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,700
ITS OWN CAPITAL.

29
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,101
YET FOR MANY YEARS, WE FAIL TO

30
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:46,737
ACKNOWLEDGE THE OBVIOUS.

31
00:00:46,737 --> 00:00:50,474
THE PLAIN REALITY THAT ISRAEL'S

32
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:52,276
CAPITAL IS JERUSALEM.

33
00:00:52,276 --> 00:00:55,112
THE UNITED STATES REMAINS FULLY

34
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:56,680
COMMITTED TO FACILITATING A

35
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,148
LASTING PEACE AGREEMENT, AND WE

36
00:00:58,148 --> 00:01:00,084
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE

37
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:02,820
STATUS QUO AT JERUSALEM'S HOLY

38
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,054
SITES, INCLUDING AT THE TEMPLE

39
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:11,595
MOUNT, ALSO KNOWN AS AVRAM AL

40
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:12,663
SHARIF.

41
00:01:12,663 --> 00:01:14,365
>> Dana: SAYING THAT THE

42
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,267
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE VIOLENCE

43
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:20,070
RESTS SQUARELY WITH HAMAS.

44
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,573
CHECK OUT PETER ALEXANDER.

45
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:25,242
>> WE BELIEVE HAMAS IS

46
00:01:25,242 --> 00:01:26,076
RESPONSIBLE.

47
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:27,077
>> IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

48
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:29,246
BEYOND THAT ON THE ISRAELI

49
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:29,613
AUTHORITY?

50
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:33,484
>> WE BELIEVE HAMAS IS AN

51
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:34,685
ORGANIZATION IS ENGAGED IN

52
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:35,419
CYNICAL ACTUALLY BEEN TO THESE

53
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:37,421
DEPTHS.

54
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:40,791
>> Dana: STARTING WITH THE

55
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,293
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DAY OR SOME

56
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:47,297
IN THE MEDIA'S TAKE ON IT.

57
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:49,299
>> Jesse: KIND OF AN ASININE

58
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:51,468
INNUENDO THAT THEY ARE MURDERING

59
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:52,469
INNOCENT CIVILIANS.

60
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:53,771
INSULTING.

61
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:55,039
HE IS BETTER THAN THAT BECAUSE

62
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,507
HE'S A PRETTY DECENT REPORTER,

63
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:57,941
SO I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY

64
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:59,309
ABOUT THAT.

65
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:01,678
WHAT IS MAKING TRUMP SO

66
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:02,713
SUCCESSFUL IS HOW HE BECAME

67
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:03,447
SUCCESSFUL AS A BUSINESSMAN IN

68
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:05,482
THESE TRANSLATING INTO BEING A

69
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:05,883
POLITICIAN.

70
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:07,751
HE IS A MAN OF HIS WORD AND HE

71
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:08,651
IS A MAN OF ACTION.

72
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:10,253
THAT'S WHY HE IS RACKING UP

73
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:14,758
THESE TANGIBLE VICTORIES.

74
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:18,495
IN 1995, CONGRESS PASSED OUR

75
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:20,697
RELOCATION ACT FOR JERUSALEM.

76
00:02:20,697 --> 00:02:21,732
IT TOOK THREE PRESIDENTS WHO DID

77
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:23,700
NOTHING AND STOOD BY NOW.

78
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,269
IVANKA AND JARED ARE THERE TODAY

79
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:28,105
FOR THE OPENING, AND THIS

80
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,873
COINCIDING WITH THE 70TH

81
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:30,874
ANNIVERSARY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT

82
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:31,608
OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL.

83
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:32,943
OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A

84
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:35,312
LITTLE CLASHING YOU'RE GOING TO

85
00:02:35,312 --> 00:02:37,681
HAVE SOME BLOWUPS AT THE BORDER.

86
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:38,382
THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED BECAUSE

87
00:02:38,382 --> 00:02:40,250
JERUSALEM I BELIEVE IS THE THIRD

88
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,220
MOST HOLY CITY FOR ISLAM.

89
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,722
THAT WILL BLOW OVER, AND YOU'LL

90
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:46,790
GET THE PEACE PROCESS BACK ON

91
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,091
TRACK.

92
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:49,726
I THINK JERROD IS DOING A PRETTY

93
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:50,527
NICE JOB.

94
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:51,728
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE KUSHNER

95
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:52,062
ACCORD.

96
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:54,198
HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE THAT DONE,

97
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:57,501
MAYBE ANOTHER NOVELL PEACE PRIZE

98
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,303
THAT JUAN CAN BE ENVIOUS OF.

99
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:00,370
I THINK THE PRESIDENT, WHEN HE

100
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,206
DOES THESE THINGS, IT'S BECAUSE

101
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:03,507
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT OFFENDING

102
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:04,074
THE STATUS QUO.

103
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:06,410
I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK WHAT

104
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,712
HAPPENED WITH HIM DEFEATING THE

105
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:10,380
CALIPHATE OR THEM, THE NATO

106
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,249
COUNTRIES PONYING UP THEIR FAIR

107
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:13,917
SHARE.

108
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:15,285
OR TEARING UP NAFTA ARE

109
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:15,886
RENEGOTIATING NAFTA.

110
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:17,287
THESE KIND OF THINGS, HE DOESN'T

111
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:19,890
REALLY CARE ABOUT THE BALL BACK.

112
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,692
HE ALSO SAYS THE OBVIOUS.

113
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:22,326
JERUSALEM IS OBVIOUSLY THE

114
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,895
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.

115
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:27,698
IT'S OBVIOUS WE NEED A BORDER

116
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:28,699
WITH MEXICO.

117
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,334
IT'S OBVIOUS CHINA IS STEALING

118
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:30,701
JOBS.

119
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:31,935
IT'S OBVIOUS NORTH KOREA NEEDS

120
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:34,505
TO BE DEALT WITH AND NOW HE'S

121
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,306
DOING THAT WITH THE MAXIMUM

122
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:37,508
CAMPAIGN OF PRESSURE OR

123
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,009
DIPLOMATICALLY, MILITARILY, EVEN

124
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:39,610
THROUGH TWITTER.

125
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,512
HE HAS BROUGHT THEM TO THE

126
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,312
TABLE.

127
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:44,014
THEY ARE GOING TO END THE KOREAN

128
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:44,515
WAR.

129
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,283
I THINK THEY ARE TOTALLY

130
00:03:46,283 --> 00:03:47,484
IMPLODING THEIR UNDERGROUND

131
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:48,252
NUCLEAR TESTING FACILITY.

132
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:49,887
THEY ARE SEALING OFF THE

133
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:50,320
ENTRANCES.

134
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,822
IT'S A HUGE STEP, RELEASING THE

135
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:55,692
HOSTAGES IS A HUGE STEP.

136
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:57,294
NOW YOU HAVE THIS SUMMIT IN

137
00:03:57,294 --> 00:03:57,661
SINGAPORE.

138
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:58,295
IT LOOKS POSITIVE.

139
00:03:58,295 --> 00:03:59,696
WE'LL GO IN THERE WITH CLEAR AND

140
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:00,697
OPEN EYES.

141
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:02,599
I THINK "THE FIVE" SHOULD MAYBE

142
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,500
GO TO SINGAPORE AND BROADCAST.

143
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,968
WE COULD ALL MAKE THE TRIP.

144
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:06,470
>> Dana: DO YOU WANT TO TALK

145
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,272
ABOUT VENEZUELA WHILE WE ARE AT

146
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:08,539
IT?

147
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:14,778
MUCH EVERYPLACE.

148
00:04:14,778 --> 00:04:16,914
I WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH OTHER

149
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:18,315
PRESIDENTS DOING NOTHING.

150
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:20,216
I THINK THIS PRESIDENT WAS ABLE

151
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:21,517
TO SAY, THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM

152
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:22,486
THAT THERE WOULD BE MASS

153
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:24,154
PROTESTS AND VIOLENCE THAT WAS

154
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:26,123
AWESOME OF TODAY BUT IT'S NOT

155
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:28,492
THE PARADE OF HORRIBLES PEOPLE

156
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:29,059
ANTICIPATED, KIMBERLY.

157
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:32,329
IT'S POSSIBLE THE PEACE PROCESS

158
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:33,230
COULD GET BACK ON TRACK.

159
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,532
THERE'S A BETTER PATH FOR THE

160
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:36,466
PALESTINIANS IF THEY WANTED.

161
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,401
THE OTHER THING THAT HAS CHANGED

162
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,937
IS ALSO YOU HAVE NOW OTHER

163
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:50,781
COUNTRIES LIKE SAUDI TELLING THE

164
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:51,515
PALESTINIANS YOU NEED TO GET ON

165
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:52,249
BOARD WITH WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN

166
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:52,549
HERE.

167
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:53,150
IF YOU WANT A TWO-STATE

168
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,650
SOLUTION, STEP UP.

169
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,351
>> Kimberly: I THINK YOU MAKE

170
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:54,885
AN IMPORTANT POINT.

171
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:55,552
WHEN YOU LOOK AT MOMENT IN

172
00:04:55,552 --> 00:04:56,286
AMERICAN AND ISRAELI HISTORY IN

173
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:56,987
TERMS OF HOW IT AFFECTS THAT

174
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:58,922
AREA OF THE WORLD, IT'S BEEN

175
00:04:58,922 --> 00:04:59,690
COMPLETELY FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS

176
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,490
FOR SO LONG.

177
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,826
I THINK THIS WAS A REALLY

178
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:04,995
POWERFUL MOVE FORWARD IN THE

179
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:05,462
RIGHT DIRECTION.

180
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:07,431
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS THE MORAL

181
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:08,632
AND POLITICAL COURAGE TO BE ABLE

182
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:09,833
TO DO THIS WITH THE PROMISE HE

183
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,068
MADE TO THE PEOPLE AND HE

184
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:12,236
FULFILLED IT.

185
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:13,370
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL

186
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,771
COMMIT TO BE A PERSON OF YOUR

187
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:17,107
WORK, AS IT RELATES TO DEMONIC

188
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:17,841
RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRY.

189
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:18,575
IF YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DO

190
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:19,376
SOMETHING AND YOU MAKE A

191
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:20,344
PROMISE, YOU WANT TO WRITE I'M

192
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:22,546
VERY HAPPY THERE WASN'T A

193
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:25,549
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE.

194
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:28,719
PEOPLE WORRIED THINGS WILL

195
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:29,653
HAPPEN IF THIS OCCURRED.

196
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:31,121
IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT

197
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,689
DIRECTION IN TERMS OF THE

198
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:33,490
RELATIONSHIP NOT ONLY WITH

199
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,825
ISRAEL BUT THE INVERTED STATES,

200
00:05:34,825 --> 00:05:37,494
THE SAUDIS BEING ON BOARD, AND

201
00:05:37,494 --> 00:05:38,228
NOW LET'S GET THE PALESTINIANS

202
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,330
TO THE TABLE AS WELL.

203
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,298
WHY NOT TRY?

204
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:42,332
THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE

205
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:44,434
RIGHT DIRECTION TO BE ABLE TO DO

206
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:46,503
THAT.

207
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:47,904
>> Dana: THERE WAS SOME

208
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:48,739
VIOLENCE.

209
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:49,973
51 PEOPLE HAVE DIED.

210
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:51,241
THEY SAY THOUSANDS ARE INJURED

211
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:51,742
IN ADDITION.

212
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:53,310
MAYBE WE WILL FIND OUT MORE IN

213
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,345
THE COMING DAYS.

214
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:56,546
>> Kimberly: BUT DUE TO HAMAS.

215
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:58,282
>> Juan: NO, THEY WERE SHOT

216
00:05:58,282 --> 00:06:00,083
AND KILLED BY ISRAELIS.

217
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,319
>> Dana: WERE THE ISRAELIS

218
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,287
DEFENDING THEMSELVES?

219
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:04,488
>> Juan: THEY WEREN'T.

220
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,089
>> Dana: HAMAS DOES TRY TO

221
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,891
MAKE SURE THE MEDIA IS COVERING

222
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:08,792
IT IN THAT WAY.

223
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,394
>> Juan: YOU GUYS ARE SO

224
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:11,395
ONE-SIDED I AM SURPRISED YOU

225
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:13,797
DON'T FALL OFF THE EARTH.

226
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:17,634
IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S SO CLEAR WE

227
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:20,704
ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE ISRAEL

228
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:21,471
IS ON THE OTHER SIDE LITERALLY

229
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:24,107
OF A FENCE.

230
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:24,875
THESE PEOPLE, YOU'RE 35,000

231
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,710
PEOPLE.

232
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,278
IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN HAMAS, YOU

233
00:06:28,278 --> 00:06:29,946
TRY TO LINK IT TO A TERRORIST

234
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:30,480
GROUP.

235
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,549
IT'S AN EXPRESSION OF PEOPLE WHO

236
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:33,483
FEEL THAT THEY ARE BEING RUN

237
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:37,120
OVER AND RUN OUT OF LAND AND

238
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,821
PROPERTY THAT WAS ONCE THEIRS

239
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:40,223
AND THAT THERE IS NO LONGER HOPE

240
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:42,426
FOR A TWO-STATE SOLUTION.

241
00:06:42,426 --> 00:06:44,294
NETANYAHU HAS MADE IT VERY

242
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:44,594
CLEAR.

243
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:45,896
PRESIDENT TRUMP IT LOOKS LIKE BY

244
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:47,764
MAKING THIS HIGHLY PROVOCATIVE

245
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:54,471
MOVE DOESN'T CARE THAT THE

246
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:56,440
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAEL

247
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,473
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAEB

248
00:06:56,473 --> 00:06:56,707
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAET

249
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:56,740
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAEW

250
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:56,907
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAEE

251
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:56,940
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAEW

252
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:56,973
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAER

253
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:57,307
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAEE

254
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:57,341
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAEG

255
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:57,374
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAEI

256
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:57,708
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAEG

257
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:57,741
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAET

258
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:58,875
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAEO

259
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:58,909
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAEB

260
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:59,176
POTENTIALLY AS -- WE LOVE ISRAEE

261
00:06:59,176 --> 00:06:59,910
THE FORCE THAT NEGOTIATED SOME

262
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,912
KIND OF PEACE.

263
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:04,014
THAT BROUGHT FINALLY SOME PIECE

264
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:06,316
TO THE MIDDLE EAST.

265
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:07,751
INSTEAD WE HAVE ISRAEL FIRING AT

266
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:08,752
IRAN IN SYRIA.

267
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:09,853
SYRIA UP IN FLAMES NOW.

268
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:12,923
WE HAVE UNSETTLED SITUATION HERE

269
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:13,790
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE

270
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,291
PALESTINIANS.

271
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,759
WHAT HAVE WE DONE?

272
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,894
WE ARE NO LONGER SEEKING PEACE.

273
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:19,396
NETANYAHU APPARENTLY CAN DO

274
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:20,530
ANYTHING HE WANTS.

275
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,265
THE PALESTINIANS FEEL GREATLY

276
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:26,103
AGGRIEVED, AND HAMAS NOW HAS

277
00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:26,903
MORE MARTYRS AND YOU HAVE

278
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:29,639
EXTREMISM FUELED.

279
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,708
I AM INCREDULOUS THAT YOU SEE

280
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,910
THIS AS GOOD.

281
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,512
>> Dana: I DO THINK --

282
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:36,680
>> Greg: I CAN RESPOND.

283
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,849
>> Dana: I HAD A GOOD POINT.

284
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:42,219
IT ISN'T IN ISRAEL -- IT'S IN

285
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:44,421
ISRAEL'S INTEREST TO CALM THE

286
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:47,557
VIOLENCE.

287
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:49,726
SO THEY CAN LIVE SIDE-BY-SIDE IN

288
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:50,460
PEACE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID

289
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,696
HE BELIEVES THE STATUS QUO WAS

290
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:54,097
ACCESS TO THE HOLY SITES IN

291
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:54,698
JERUSALEM SHOULD REMAIN.

292
00:07:54,698 --> 00:07:58,301
I DON'T THINK IT'S AS BAD AS

293
00:07:58,301 --> 00:07:58,902
JUAN WAS SAYING.

294
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:01,905
>> Greg: I WANT TO STEP BACK

295
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:02,672
AND DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM,

296
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:04,307
EXACTLY WHAT THIS SAYS, WHICH AS

297
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:06,176
WE BEGIN ON ONE SIDE AND WE END

298
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:07,778
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

299
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,845
THIS IS A PRISON.

300
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:11,014
THIS ENTIRE ISSUE IS A PRISON OF

301
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:11,515
TWO SIDES.

302
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:14,117
EITHER ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO

303
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:15,185
EXIST OR PALESTINIANS ARE

304
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:16,920
VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE.

305
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,321
THERE IS NO OTHER SIDE.

306
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:19,055
THE INTENSITY OF MEDIA COVERAGE

307
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:22,692
ON THIS ISSUE IS THE EXACT

308
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:23,326
OPPOSITE OF THE LEVEL OF

309
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:24,761
UNDERSTANDING AND INTEREST OF

310
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:27,731
THE PUBLIC.

311
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:29,099
THE PUBLIC IS NOT AS INTERESTED

312
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:30,901
IN THIS ISSUE AS THE MEDIA MAKES

313
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:31,935
IT OUT TO BE.

314
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:34,504
THIS IS WHY WE DON'T HAVE ANY

315
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:35,739
MIDDLE EAST EXPERTS.

316
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:37,908
WE HAVE MORE MIDDLE EARTH

317
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:39,275
EXPERTS AND MIDDLE EAST EXPERTS.

318
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:40,544
YOU KNOW THAT WHEN THIS IS GOING

319
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:43,179
TO HAPPEN, THEY ARE GOING TO

320
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,080
CREATE PROGRAMMING POTENTIAL

321
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,581
WITH RETALIATION.

322
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:51,688
YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU SEND UP

323
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:52,322
THESE BALLOONS FILLED WITH

324
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:53,056
BOMBS, YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT ON

325
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:53,790
CAMERA, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE

326
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,925
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

327
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:56,092
DOES THIS DISPLAY OF VIOLENCE ON

328
00:08:56,092 --> 00:08:58,895
THE SUFFERING THAT OCCURS HAVE

329
00:08:58,895 --> 00:09:01,131
ANY EFFECT IN THE LAND WERE FOUR

330
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:02,499
DECADES OF VIOLENCE HAS BEEN

331
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:06,102
HAPPENING ANYWAY.

332
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:07,938
CLASHES ERUPT EVERY SINGLE DAY.

333
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,906
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

334
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:11,007
WE ARE JADED AND CONFUSED ABOUT

335
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:14,311
THIS AREA.

336
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:16,713
I RESIST THIS IDEA THAT IT'S A

337
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:17,481
TWO-SIDED THING.

338
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:18,381
THE SOLUTION HAS TO ADMIT THAT

339
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:20,417
THE CURRENT WAY OF DEALING WITH

340
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,351
THIS IS GOING NOWHERE.

341
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:23,753
IT'S GOING NOWHERE.

342
00:09:23,753 --> 00:09:25,155
AS LONG AS THERE'S ALWAYS GOING

343
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:27,057
TO BE VIOLENCE, THERE'S ALWAYS

344
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:29,559
GOING TO BE VIOLENCE.

345
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,761
>> Dana: THE QUESTION OF

346
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:33,730
JERUSALEM IS NOW OFF THE TABLE.

347
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,198
>> Kimberly: NOT TO MINIMIZE

348
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:37,133
THE VIOLENCE AND LOSS OF LIVES,

349
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:37,968
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

350
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,236
THE PREDICTION WAS THIS WOULD BE

351
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:42,539
CATASTROPHIC AND WIDESPREAD AND

352
00:09:42,539 --> 00:00:00,000
CREATING AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF
