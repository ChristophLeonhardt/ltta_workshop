2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use this DSLR camera for doing some</font>

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,309
vlogs the last couple of logs because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,559
really want to try doing things kind of

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,960
from a different perspective and I feel

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,619
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this camera gives me I don't know</font>

7
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,210
more control how everything looks

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,699
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the problem I'm having is</font>

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,710
there's an LCD screen right there and

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,359
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I got to look over at it and I</font>

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,189
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like what's he looking at</font>

12
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,900

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,750
movie and is a don't look at the camera

14
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,830
when you're using these cameras you're

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,210
making a vlog it's like don't look at

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,190
the LCD screen or else it ends up

17
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,829
