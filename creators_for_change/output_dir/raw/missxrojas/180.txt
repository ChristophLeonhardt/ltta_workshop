00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so as I mentioned in my</font>

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,540
previous video<font color="#E5E5E5"> this month is a big month</font>

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,560
for meat there are lots of events

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,270
there's travel<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an award ceremony</font>

5
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's just there's a lot going on so I</font>

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,679
had a big wardrobe panic I said I don't

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">really have a think were really</font>

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,370
exaggerated that to a point of no return

9
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,529
and eventually last week I found myself

10
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,630
in Topshop I was walking around the shop

11
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,279
floor when one of the personal shoppers

12
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,109
approached me and said we don't have any

13
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,490
bond at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> which of actually is</font>

14
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,750
when were big fitting rooms you can try

15
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">and choosing that it's all free there's</font>

16
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,869
no minimums band it's really really good

17
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,789
space to try and place so I said yeah

18
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,769
why not but suddenly because she was

19
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,480
such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good personal shopper I found</font>

20
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">myself telling her about all the</font>

21
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,870
anxieties they had about my body at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

22
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,030
time obviously I have put on weight as a

23
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,739
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people point out thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

24
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,090
by the way I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did tell her a lot about</font>

25
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things that it isn't like learning</font>

26
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,750
to dress as someone who has boobs and it

27
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,700
was really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful and I didn't</font>

28
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,260
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like she was pushing anything on to</font>

29
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,780
me that said because<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

30
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,879
really good and knowledgeable very keen

31
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have me leaving feeling good and give</font>

32
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,039
honest advice I did end up spending a

33
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,510
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money understanding that fitting</font>

34
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,070
room I sort of felt a little bit like

35
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,809
that game I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the grocers and I</font>

36
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,869
got a banana and watching and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a potato</font>

37
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,430
and all that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just kept adding</font>

38
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,710
adding adding adding<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so picked up all</font>

39
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,299
this stuff it was wonderful<font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt very</font>

40
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,939
happy and you know that shoppers<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi when</font>

41
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,100
I also had that panic that I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

42
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">whenever I use my card even when it's</font>

43
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,509
completely completely unfounded of

44
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,189
getting my card declined and having that

45
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,600
embarrassing conversation because I've

46
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,280
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> that conversation with people a lot</font>

47
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,049
of times working reach out but you

48
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,790
personally just fill the dredge I think

49
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,229
natalie tran made a video about this

50
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:32,790
actually anyway so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just been</font>

51
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,320
paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> i checked my bag without before</font>

52
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,030
going out everything's absolutely fine

53
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,220
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i pay and the card gets declined and</font>

54
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,720
they say well we actually think it's

55
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,939
just our system and go get cash out so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

56
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,710
did that actually what turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out is that</font>

57
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,420
someone had stolen some of my card

58
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,460
identity and had really tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font>

59
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">something for $27 or 27 pounds of</font>

60
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,659
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they called it just in</font>

61
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,119
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it didn't get charged anyway so</font>

62
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,470
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole panic</font>

63
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,500
around it whole saga but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of</font>

64
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">it I've got some really really nice</font>

65
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,229
clothes and one thing I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

66
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,399
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say is that if you're in a</font>

67
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,409
better place through in a bad mood or if

68
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,119
you're feeling loathe and shopping<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

69
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,590
spending money<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it because I</font>

70
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's such a lie and it's such a</font>

71
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,970
short<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi you do feel fix for a while but</font>

72
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,490
it doesn't fix the problem

73
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,080
it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also it just creates</font>

74
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,820
really kind of unhealthy patterns and

75
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,790
can sometimes legitimately lead to you

76
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,230
getting a store card and you getting

77
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">into a lot of debt don't ever get a</font>

78
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,890
store card don't do it as someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

79
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,410
had a store guard once Joe Dirt but yeah

80
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,520
I do think that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are certain things</font>

81
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,500
that are helpful like dressing for your

82
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">shape and getting advice and on how</font>

83
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,940
things look and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of not what's</font>

84
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,310
on trend but of how you want to look and

85
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,690
how you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to present myself I think I</font>

86
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">said something along the lines of I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

87
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,390
things that look a bit tailored and

88
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,300
interesting cuts but also casual light

89
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,700
fabric and patterns and stuff like that

90
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,660
and you just brought out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

91
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,370
things I was like yeah that and that

92
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,780
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect why were these things</font>

93

143
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,699
pair of leggings I bought a couple of

144

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,400
which is these leggings and they're

147
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,990
really really basic they have a nice

148
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,849
houndstooth pattern they work really

149
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:40,159
well with my plain black jumper and my

look to halfway presentable but it's

155
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,270
also important to just keep things easy

156
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,969
