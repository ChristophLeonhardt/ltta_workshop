Tucker: YOU MAY HAVE MISSED IT BUT ROBERT MUELLER INDICTED 13 RUSSIAN NATIONALED AND THREE RUSSIAN COMPANIES EARLIER THIS YEAR. THE THOUGHT IS THEY WOULDN'T SHOW UP FOR COURT. NOW THEY'RE CONTESTING AND THE CASE IS GOING TO COURT AND THAT MIGHT BE BAD FOR ROBERT MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION. HOW AND WHY? NOBODY CAN ANSWER THOUGH QUESTIONS MORE THAN JOSEY. WHY WOULD THIS BE BAD TO GO TO TRIAL? BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT READY FOR IT. THEY INDICTED A CASE PREMATURELY AGAINST PEOPLE THAT THEY NEVER THOUGHT WOULD SHOW UP FROM RUSSIA. ONE OF THE RUSSIAN COMPANY HIRED LAWYERS AND SENT THEM TO COURT TO SAY WE'RE HERE AND WE WANT TO PLEAD NOT GUILTY AND WE WANT DISCOVERY ON YOUR CRIMINAL CASE AGAINST US. MR. MUELLER'S PEOPLE OBJECTED AND SAID WE'RE NOT READY FOR AN ARRAIGNMENT. THEY'RE NOT HERE PROPERLY. THE FEDERAL JUDGE SAID, MR. MUELLER, YOU INDICTED THIS CASE. IT'S YOUR CASE. IT'S GOING TO TRIAL. LET'S START THIS PROCESS RIGHT NOW. GET DISCOVERY. Tucker: YOU'RE SAYING HE INDICTED PEOPLE WITHOUT BEING READY TO PROVE THEY'RE GUILTY? THAT'S RIGHT. HE A BECAUSED THE GRAND JURY PROCESS AS HE HAS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS OUTRAGEOUS INVESTIGATION AUTHORIZED BY MR. ROSENSTEIN. THIS IS ROSENSTEIN'S MONSTER IN SPADES. Tucker: YOU WERE A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR. IT SEEMS BORDERLINE IMMORAL TO INDICT SOMEBODY UNLESS THEY'RE GUILTY. THEY DID IT FOR ONE REASON ONLY. ROBERT MUELLER NEEDED SOMETHING RUSSIAN TO MAKE HIS INVESTIGATION LOOK GOOD. HE INDICTED 13 PEOPLE AND CORPORATIONS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY THAT HE THOUGHT WOULD NEVER SHOW UP AND BINGO, ONE OF THEM SHOWS UP AND SAYS PROVE IT, MOTHER. Tucker: THAT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE STORY. IMAGINE IF HE DID THAT TO AMERICANS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, FLYNN. HE ALREADY HAS. HE DOES IT TO MR. FLYNN. Tucker: UNBELIEVABLE.
