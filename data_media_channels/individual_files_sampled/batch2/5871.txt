we've got to start with the president he was taking the stage in Evansville Indiana to campaign for a Republican Senate nominee Mike Braun but the speech quickly devolved into a replay of the president's greatest hits after two days of wild Twitter outbursts calling the media again the enemy of the people and falsely accusing NBC of fudging an interview the president energized his local supporters by calling out you guessed it the fake news these are just dishonest terrible people I'm telling you that you can put terrible aside the president is dishonest every single day please remember that he also renewed his attacks on big tech specifically Google for having rigged search results but this time it included a dire warning that if we are not careful we could lose our free speech rights I made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship blacklisting a great search results ok here's what makes no sense he's taught he's warning us about potential censorship political censorship but at that same event the president made his noble call to protect free speech and that same night one of his campaign aides physically blocked the lens of a press photographer to prevent him from taking a photo of a protester but that guy couldn't block the president's view where the hell did she come from and now tomorrow that's one person and now tomorrow you're gonna read headlines Trump had protesters all over the place perhaps one of the most confusing lines came when the president discussed the growing amount of candidates who are self professed socialists warning that if elected they could change some government programs and they want to raid Medicare to pay for socialism somehow I don't see Indiana being the next Venezuela I just don't I don't see that the president knows what socialism is raid Medicare to pay for socialism wow I got a question for Sarah Sanders about that one and he could not end the night without another stark warning to his own Justice Department what's happening is a disgrace and at some point I wanted to stay out but at some point if it doesn't straighten out properly I want him to do their job I will get involved and I'll get in there by half he could have just got on stage and said Tuesday starts Brett Cavanaugh's confirmation and dropped the mic he would have gotten a standing ovation the campaign style speech come 67 days before the midterms amid more reports surfacing that the president and his dwindling staff are wholly unprepared to handle the all-out assault they could face if Democrats retake Congress hey there are chris hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
