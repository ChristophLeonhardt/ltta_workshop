00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,720
book is supposed to affect you because

103
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,600
that's one thing one<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why I wanted</font>

104

writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like to do that too</font>

111
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,300

112
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,039
writer of course I didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this at</font>
