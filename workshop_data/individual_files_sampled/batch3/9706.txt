. WELCOME TO THE GAYLORD PALMS RESORT AND CONVENTION CENTER IN ORLANDO. TONIGHT THE TOP TWO REPUBLICANS IN THE RACE FOR FLORIDA GOVERNOR I. MARTHA MacCALLUM. THE AFTERNOON. A SHOOTING AT A NEWSROOM IN MARYLAND. THE LATEST THAT WE KNOW IS THAT AT LEAST 5 PEOPLE ARE DEAD. MULTIPLE PEOPLE ARE INJURED. AND THE GUNMAN IS IN CUSTODY. TODAY. TARGETS TODAY. WE DON’T KNOW WHY. WE WILL GET TO THE TOPIC LATER IN THE DEBATE. FIRST ISSUES KEY IN FLORIDA AND TO THE NATION. LET’S MEET THEM. FIRST WE HAVE ADAM PUTNAM, THE FLORIDA COMMISSIONER OF AGRICULTURE. . AND WE HAVE RON DESANTIS. A CONGRESSMAN REPRESENTING FLORIDA’S 6th DISTRICT. WELCOME. YOU HAVE 60 SECONDS TO ANSWER AND 30 SECONDS FOR FOLLOW-UPS AND 30 SECONDS IF THEIR NAME IS MENTIONED BY EITHER CANDIDATE. YOU GO OVER THE ALLOTTED TIME YOU WILL HEAR A BELL AND IT SETS OFF DOGS AROUND THE NATION THINK ANTHONY KENNEDY RETIREMENT ANNOUNCEMENT COULD HAVE A MAJOR EFFECT ON MANY ISSUES CONSIDERING THAT HE WAS THE SWING VOTE IN THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. ABORTION MAY BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST. BOTH OF YOU ON STAGE SAID YOU WOULD SIGN THE HEART DETERIORATE BEAT BILL HERE IN FLORIDA WHICH WOULD BAN ABORTIONS AFTERA FETAL HEART BEAT IS DETECTED. THAT IS VIEWED AS A DIRECT CHALLENGER TO ROE V. WADE. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SHOULD VOTE ON OVERTURN ROE V. WADE? FIRST OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THE GOOD PEOPLE IN NAPS. ANNAPOLIS. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT RESPONDED SO RAPIDLY. WHAT AN EXCITING TIME TO BE IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE OF 1,000 FLORIDA REPUBLICANS. IT’S DIFFERENT THAN A WASHINGTON, D.C. STUDIO. WELCOME TO FLORIDA, CONGRESSMAN. . TO REMAKE THE U.S. SUPREME COURT WITH A CONSTITUTIONALIST DECADES TO COME. WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHO IT IS. IF THEY ARE NEAR AS GOOD AS JUSTICE GORSUCH HAS BEEN, IT’S HEART BEAT BILL. WE NEED A CONSTITUTIONALIST ON THE BENCH SOMEONE THAT WON’T TRY TO MAKE LAW FROM THE BENCH BUT WILL ABIDE BY OUR CONSTITUTION AND PROTECT AND DEFEND LIVES. . THAT MEANS YES, IT SHOULD BE A JUSTICE WHO OVERTURNS ROE V. CONSTITUTIONALIST ON THE BENCH. SOMEONE THAT RECOGNIZING THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY. SOMEONE WHO ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT OUR FOUNDERS INTEND ITTED THAT YOU DEFEND LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PERSUIT OF HAPPINESS. I AM HONORED TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE FLORIDA FAMILY ACTION COUNCIL IN THE GOVERNOR’S RACE HERE IN FLORIDA. THEY KNOW THAT AS GOVERNOR I WILL PURSUE A PRO-LIFE AGENDA HERE IN FLORIDA AS FLORIDA’S NEXT GOVERNOR. CONGRESS DESANTIS, THE SAME QUESTION TO YOU. YOUR QUESTION: WOULD IT BE SOMEONE TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE? I AM PROUD TO HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THIS RACE. . I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE A BETTER JOB OF APPOINTING OTHER PRESIDENT IN MY LIFETIME INCLEATING ONE INCLUDING ONE EVER MY HEROES RONALD REAGAN. THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPLACE JUSTICE KENNEDY SHOULD BE APPLY THE LAW AS IT IS WRITTEN AND NOT TO LEGISLATE OR IMPOSE A JUDGE’S PHILOSOPHY ON THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. THERE IS AN AN LOG IN FLORIDA. THE NEXT GOVERNOR WILL HAVE 3 APPOINTMENTS TO THE STATE SUPREME COURT. ANY. THE BEST POSITION TO IDENTIFY THOSE CANDIDATES FOR THE STATE SUPREME COURT WHO WILL APPLY THE LAW FAITHFULLY. IF WE GET IT RIGHT WE CAN END JUDICIAL ACTIVISM IN FLORIDA FOR A GENERATION. . CONGRESSMAN DESANTIS, TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED HE WILL MEET WITH THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN ON JULY CONTINUE ITS TO SAY THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MEDDLING IN OUR ELECTION. BUT VICE-PRESIDENT PENCE AND TRUMP’S OWN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY SAID INTERFERENCE TOOK PLACE. WHO IS RIGHT? THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT RUSSIA MAY HAVE DONE. I THINK THEY ARE ALWAYS UP TO NO GOOD AND TRIED TO DO CYBER STUFF IN OUR ELECTION. BUT THAT’S DIFFERENT THAN SAYING THERE WAS COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP’S CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA. THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. I HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE TO UNCOVER THE ANTI-TRUMP BIAS. YOU HAVE THE GUY WHO OPENED UP THE COLLUSION INVESTIGATION. PETER STRZOK, HE OPENED UP THE INVESTIGATION A WEEK LATER SAID NO, TRUMP WON’T BE PRESIDENT. WE WILL STOP HIM. A WEEK LATER HE TEXTED HIS LOVER AND SAID WE NEED AN INSURANCE POLICY IN CASE THIS GUY WINS. I AM ONE OF THE FEW WHO WERE OUT THERE FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN COMEY WAS FIRED. I WAS RIGHT THERE SAYING THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WHEN MUELLER WAS APPOINTED. I SAID THERE WAS NO BASIS. I KNEW IT WAS WRONG AND I STOOD FOR WHAT I BELIEVED WAS RIGHT. MR. PUTNAM, AS YOU JUST HEARD, PRESIDENT TRUMP ENDORSED YOUR OPT. OPPONENT? WHY IS THE PRESIDENT WRONG? THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO MORE THAN HOLD HIS OWN IN A SUMMIT AGAINST PUTIN. I AM PROUD OF HIM FOR TAKING IT ON AND HIS AGENDA TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT. I AM RUNNING A FLORIDA FIRST OUR COUNTRY THAN WHAT IS GOING ON IN WASHINGTON, D.C. OF OUR WATER THAN I DO ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN RUSSIA. I CARE MORE ABOUT THE OTHER IT’S GOING TO INCREASE THE TIMES OF CAREER OPPORTUNITIES THAT KEEP OUR BRIGHTEST AND BEST HERE IN FLORIDA. AND MAKE US A MAGNET FOR TALENT FROM AROUND THE WORLD. THAT’S THE JOB OF THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE TO PUT THE THIRD LARGEST STATE IN A POSITION TO HELP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN BY OUR STRENGTH IN REPAIRED PREPARED TO ENDORSE PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 2020? MOST ASSUREDLY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CAMPAIGNING WITH HIM. IN 2016 YOU COULD NOT FIND HIM IF YOU HAD A SEARCH WARRANT. I SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT’S AGENDA FOR OUR COUNTRY AND ALL OF US PAID LESS IN TAXES THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF TRUMP’S TAX TO OUR SO-CALLED TRADING PARTNERS TO DEFEND FLORIDA FARMERS AND HE WENT TO NORTH KOREA TO DENUCLEARIZE THE PENINSULA AND THE FACT HE IS GETTING ANOTHER SUPREME COURT AND TOGETHER WE GET TO WATCH AMERICA GET WERT BY THE DAY WHILE HILLARY CLINTON EXPLAINS THE TITLE OF HER BOOK, WHAT HAPPENED. SHE LOST, THAT’S WHAT HAPPENED. CONGRESSMAN DESANTIS, YOU HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. BUT ACCORDING TO TWO RECENT POLLS, YOUR OPPONENT HAS THE SUPPORT OF TWICE AS MANY FLORIDA REPUBLICANS AS YOU DO. YOU MADE A LOT OF APPEARANCES ON YOUR NETWORK. LEADING COMMISSIONER PUTNAM TO SAY YOU ARE RUNNING THIS RACE HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO WHAT HE IS CHARGING? HE SAID I HAVE NOT SPENT ENOUGH TIME IN FLORIDA. I WAS BORN AND RAISEED IN FLORIDA. REPRESENTING FLORIDA. I WENT TO IT HIGH SCHOOL HERE. WORKED $6 AN HOUR TO MAKE SOMETHING OF MYSELF. I DIDN’T HAVE ANYTHING HANDED TO ME. THERE WERE TIMES I WISH I COULD HAVE SPENT MORE TIME IN FLORIDA. THE CHRISTMAS OF 2006 I WAS NOT HOME WITH MY FAMILY. I WAS IN GUANTANAMO BAY CUBA. WAS IN IRAQ WORKING FOR THE COMMANDING OFFICER. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BEEN IN FLORIDA WITH MY FAMILY. SOMETIMES DUTY CALLS AND YOU HAVE TO STEP UP AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT. SOME OF THE THINGS I HAVE BEEN DOING TO SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT AGENDA, THIS MORNING I WAS GRILLING ROB ROSENSTEIN WHY THERE WAS ANTI-TRUMP BIAS AND WHY THEY ARE NOT COMING CLEAN WITH US AND WHY THEY WERE MONITORING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THAT’S WHAT I WAS PAID TO DO. AT THE END OF THE DAY BOTH THINGS ARE VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. I WILL KEEP DOING BOTH. 42% OF YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS UNDERSTAND, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SPEND HALF THE YEAR IN FLORIDA. A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE THEY TALKED ABOUT ARE BIG SUPPORTERS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF SPENDS A LOT OF TIME IN FLORIDA. HE IS NOT A FLORIDA RESIDENT. WHAT WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE TAX CUTS WE PASSED GETTING RID OF THE SUBSIDY FOR HIGH TAX STATES, PEOPLE WILL SAY WHY DO I HAVE A BUSINESS IN ILLINOIS? I CAN BRING IT TO FLORIDA. WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO BETTER IN FINANCE, TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING IF WE HAVE THE RICK SCOTT. . MR. PUTNAM, IN RECENT WEEKS WE HAVE SEEN A REAL RISE IN INSTABILITY AROUND THE ISSUE OF BORDER POLICY. LAST WEEK PAM BONDI WAS HARASSED IN A MOVIE THEATRE HERE. MANY DEMOCRATS AND EVEN A FEW REPUBLICANS SAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SET THE TONE HERE AT THE BEGINNING. DURING THE CAMPAIGN, YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE CRITICAL REPUBLICANS. CONGRESSMAN DESANTIS MENTIONED IT THERE. YOU CALLED TRUMP VILE AND OBSCENE AND DISHONORABLE. DOES HE DESERVE SOME OF THE BLAME? I DIDN’T CALL THE PRESIDENT THOSE THINGS. I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT. TRYING TO BLAME HIM FOR. LOOK AT WHAT MAXINE WATERS HAS SAID. YOUR QUESTION ABOUT OUT OF STATE INFLUENCE IN FLORIDA. THE REAL DANGER IS NOTING WHAT IS GOING THIS STAGE, IT’S THE FACT THAT TWO MEN ARE TRYING TO HIGH JACK FLORIDA POLITICS. IT’S NOT BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT HOW LONG HE SPEND IN TRAFFIC OR CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF OUR SCHOOLS IN NORTHWEST FLORIDA. IT’S NOT BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE WATER IN THE LAKE. IT’S BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT ONE THING ONLY. THAT IS DEFEATING OUR PRESIDENT, TAKING BACK THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE CAN’T LET THE LEFT HIJACK FLORIDA’S POLITICS, FLORIDA’S GOVERNOR MANSION OR FLORIDA’S CABINET OR LEGISLATURE. LET ME RESPOND. THIS IS PERSONAL. I WAS THROWING BALLS TO STEVE SCALISE WHO WAS PLAYING 2ND BASE AND JEFF AND I DECIDED TO BEAT D.C. TRAFFIC DOES LEFT 5 MINUTES BEFORE STEVE WAS SHOT. WE WERE GETTING INTO A CAR. A MAN WHOM WE DIDN’T KNOW CAME UP TO US AND SAID ARE THOSE REPUBLICANS ON THE FIELD? WE WERE LIKE YES. THE REPUBLICAN TEAM. WE PULL AWAY. TWO MINUTES LATER HE GRABS A RIFLE. THANK GOD I WAS NOT THERE. I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE LINE. HE SHOT STEVE. HE WOULD HAVE SHOT 10 OR 15 REPUBLICANS. HE WAS MOTIVATED BY ANTI-TRUMP RAGE. HE WAS A RAVING LUNATIC. BUT IF THERE WERE A FOX NEWS VIEWING TRUMP SUPPORTER WHO DID THAT ARE IF DEMOCRATS THE MEDIA WOULD VIEW IT AS THE BIGGEST THING IN WORLD HISTORY. THERE THEY SWEPT IT UNDER THE RUG. PEOPLE DIDN’T TALK ABOUT IT AFTER A WEEK. THIS INSTABILITY, I DON’T BLAME DONALD TRUMP. I BLAME THAT GUY AND ALL OF HIS LEADING THE FIGHT TO CENSURE MAXINE WATERS FOR HER CONDUCT. THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY IT’S FINE TO POINT A FINGER AT MAXINE WATERS AND SAY THAT’S UNCIVIL BEHAVIOR. A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU. THE PRESIDENT IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN RESTORING CIVILITY. DOES HE? IN WASHINGTON AND THE COUNTRY TRUMP HAS ALMOST THE ENTIRE MEDIA AGAINST HIM. FAKE NEWS AGAINST HIM DAY AFTER DAY AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE LOBBYISTS AFTER HIM AND HE HAS GOT SOME REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE COME AFTER HIM. THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS LOB HAND GRENADES AT THE UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS UP AGAIN AND HE IS FACING OPPOSITION UNLIKE ANY OTHER PRESIDENT WE HAVE SEEN. . DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND? WE HAVE LOST A NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA THIS YEAR. I THINK THAT IT’S IMPORTANT THAT WE REMEMBER THE THINGS THAT WERE SAID BY THE LAST PRESIDENT THAT THAT QUESTIONED THEIR COMMITMENT. THEY STAND ON THAT THIN BLUE LINE BETWEEN ORDER AND CHAOS. I BELIEVE THAT ANYONE WHO WANTS TO POINT THE FINGER AT PRESIDENT TRUMP NEEDS TO LOOK AT THE ANTI-LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ANTI-SHERIFF AND ANTI-COP. AND MAKE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT EVERYONE IN FLORIDA KNOWS THE THERE METHOD OF INCIVILITY DID NOT BEGIN WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. IT’S ONLY REPORTED BY THE LEFT WING MEDIA BECAUSE THEY WANT TO
