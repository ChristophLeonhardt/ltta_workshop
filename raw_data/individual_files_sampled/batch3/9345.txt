THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU AN INDICATION WHERE KIM'S MIND IS. ED: WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR ALL THOSE CLUES. JOINING US TO GET INSIGHT ON THE STAKES HERE. LET'S TALK TO WALID PHARES. WALID, YOU HAVE BEEN SUCH A SHARP ANALYST OF ALL OF THESE FAST-MOVING EVENTS. AND A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN TRYING OVER THE LAST HOUR AS WE HAVE BEEN HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS. WHAT IS THE MOTIVE OF KIM JONG-UN? WHY DOES HE WANT TO COME TO THE TABLE? YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT. THIS IS THE BEST QUESTION TO BEGIN WITH. WHAT I CALL THE GENESIS OF WHY THE DICTATOR WANTED TO ENGAGE WITH THE UNITED STATES. I WOULD GO FURTHER AND SAY WHY DID HE START HIS ESCALATION. LOBBING HOSE MISSILES CLOSE TO THE NATIONAL TERRITORY. THERE IS A DEVELOPMENT IN NORTH KOREA THAT IS PROMPTING HIS ACTIONS. HE WANTS A GUARANTEE THAT HE'LL COME OUT AS A WINNER. AND PROBABLY THE SITUATION HAS TO DO WITH THE ECONOMICS OF THE COUNTRY. IT HAS ALSO TO DO WITH THE POSSIBILITY FOR HIM TO SUSTAIN THE SITUATION. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR HIM AS WELL AND HIS REGIME. AND THE ROLE OF CHINA IS INTERESTING THOUGHT IT IS IN THE BACKGROUND, I ASSUME. ED: I WANT TO ALERT OUR VIEWERS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN, THESE ARE LIVE PICTURES AT THE PALACE IN SINGAPORE WHERE PRIME MINISTER LEE WILL BE RECEIVING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU SEE OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPH I I PHOTOGRAPH ERS AND YOUNGER STAFFERS. THE PREGAME TO THIS BIG SUMMIT. BUT IN THE MEANTIME I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT YOUR IMPORTANT ANALYSIS. ARE YOU SAYING WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER? ARE YOU DISCERNING THERE IS INTELLIGENCE ABOUT POSSIBLE COUP ATTEMPTS? OR KIM JONG-UN RUNNING OUT OF CASH? ARE YOU SPECULATING SOMETHING BIG HAS BEEN HAPPENING INSIDE THE BORDERS THE PAST FEW YEARS. IT COULD BE SIMPLY A COLLAPSE OF CIVIL SOCIETY. THAT IS SOMETHING NO DICTATOR CAN CONFRONT. WHAT HE NEEDS ARE IMPORTANT INFLUX OF ECONOMIC AID FOR THE REGIME TO CONTINUE FOR THE INSTITUTIONS TO CONTINUE. THOSE WHO CAN HELP THEM ARE NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO SOUTH KOREA, CHINA, JAPAN. HE IS HEADING TOWARD AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES, NEGOTIATIONS. WAY HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT THE PAST TWO HOURS, HIS REALISM WE ARE GOING TO EXPECT IS NOT AN IMMEDIATE OVERNIGHT CHANGE. BUT A ROADMAP TO THAT CHANGE. THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE WILL BE THE AIM OF THE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE TWO PARTIES. ED: LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT ROADMAP. YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE HOW YOU DEFINE DENUCLEARIZATION CAN BE FAR DIFFERENT FROM THE NORTH KOREAN SIDE THAN THE U.S. SIDE. IF YOU WERE ADVISING THIS PRESIDENT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK HE SHOULD BE GETTING FROM THESE TALKS? IS IT WORTH THE EFFORT IF KIM JONG-UN SAYS OVER FIVE, SIX, SEVEN YEARS HE'LL DENUCLEARIZE? I AM NOT SURE HE'LL PUT A TIME FRAME. IF THEY COME UP WITH A PRINCIPLE OF YES WE AGREE ON DENUCLEARIZATION AND YES WE AGREE ON A PEACE DEAL, THAT'S THE MOST OF IMPORTANT WITH SOUTH KOREA. WE AGREE TO HAVE A NON-BELLIGERENT TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES, THAT WOULD BE VICTORY. WHAT WOULD THEY GET IN RETURN TORE THAT, THEY WILL GET AN ECONOMIC PLAN. I DON'T WANT TO CALL IT A MARSHALL PLAN. AND CHINA. ED: LET'S TALK ABOUT SINGAPORE. MANY SAY SINGAPORE AS A HOST CAN PROVIDE THE PROPER SECURITY AND THEY ARE THE SWITZERLAND OF ASIA. THEY DON'T PICK SIDE, AND THEY HAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. WITH KIM JONG-UN TAKING HIS LONGEST FOREIGN TRIP AS CHAIRMAN, WEEK SEE SOMEONE STANDING AT ATTENTION AS IF THE PRESIDENT MAY ARRIVE, SO WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT. IS THERE A SENSE KIM JONG-UN BEING IN A COUNTRY LIKE SINGAPORE, SO RICH IN ALL THE INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE, IS THIS GIVEN A LOOK OF WHAT THE FUTURE OF NORTH KOREA COULD BE? THAT'S ANOTHER VERY GOOD QUESTION. SINGAPORE IS REPRESENTATIVE WHAT WOULD BE AN ASIAN SUCCESS ECONOMICALLY. CHINA AND JAPAN, DEEP INSIDE KIM IS LOOKING AT THOSE EXAMPLES. HE KNOWS VERY WELL HE WOULD COME FROM MINUS 50 TO GET TO ZERO IN HIS OWN COUNTRY. BUT TO GET THERE HE NEED TO SOLVE ONE IMPORTANT POINT, THAT HIS REGIME HAS GUARANTEED. ANYTHING SHORT OF THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO GO FOR. HE WON'T GO FOR REFORMS THAT WILL CHANGE THE REGIME AT THIS STAGE. THAT WOULD BE OUR GUARANTEE TO HIM AND HIS GUARANTEE TO US WOULD BE THE NUKES. ED: WHAT DOES YOUR GUT TELL YOU ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT THE NEXT DAY OR TWO? I HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW. I THINK MOST OF OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ISSUES WERE ALREADY REVIEWED BY BOTH SIDES. WE ARE NOT GOING TO GO TO SINGAPORE NOT KNOWING WHAT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT. MOST OF OF IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AND AGREED UPON IN PRINCIPLE. THE DETAILS WILL BE TALKED ABOUT. ED: ARE YOU SAYING I LIED WHEN I SAID LAST QUESTION BECAUSE WE ARE EXPECTING THE PRESIDENT AT ANY MOMENT AND WE'LL GO TO HIM LIVE IN A SECOND. BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CAREFUL IN LOWERING EXPECTATIONS. THIS IS ROUND ONE, I WANT TO START A DIALOGUE. IS THAT A PUBLIC POSTURE WHEN AS YOU SUGGESTED PRIVATE? THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT THE DETAILS MORE THAN THEY LET ON? THE VISITS BY MR. POMPEO AND OTHER OFFICIALS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES HAVE REVIEWED MOST OF OF THE ISSUES IN MY VIEW. I DON'T HAVE EXACT DETAILS. BUT THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT TO BE CAUTIOUS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT WILL BE DECLARED, BUT WE KNOW WHAT THE SUBJECTS ARE GOING TO BE.
