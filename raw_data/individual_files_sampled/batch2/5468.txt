did you in any way and do you in any way think that was something that was misstated or racist in any way because that's what they were implying it has zero to do with race Shawn has everything to do with whether we want Florida to continue to go in a good direction building off the success or do we want to turn to left-wing socialist policies so that is Republican congressman Ron De Santis out last night out again this morning he is defending continuing to defend his comments and have ignited a racially charged firestorm in the Florida governor's race by the way a race that is only in day to the president Trump backed candidate is accused of trying to stoke racial tensions when he said the policies of his opponent Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gilliam the first black major party candidate for governor in Florida would hurt the state the exact quote was monkey this up as you know from our coverage on this show yesterday joining me now from Tallahassee is mayor Andrew Gila mayor Gilliam thank you very much for be on the program it's good to have you on it's so good to be with you thanks for having me this morning let me start with what your opponent here Rhonda Sanchez had to say just in the last couple of minutes on Laura Ingram's radio show I want to play you what he said and I want to ask you about it the silly PC stuff has got a spot the manufactured outrage has got to stop the notion that somehow is far less socialism which is disqualifying was not really what I was trying to do is trying to send some double secret coded message it's absurd I am NOT going to apologize because I didn't say anything about race it had nothing to do with race it had to do with his far left socialist platform so a couple of things here mayor number one do you believe DeSantis III think DeSantis has decided to pull page from the Trump campaign playbook and I think it's unfortunate but I will tell you this Holly I think it will be completely unsuccessful we got fooled once by this before people are really sick and tired of this kind of race baiting division derisively meant to doctor to our politics and I think that's why quite frankly we're going to win this race on November 6 because we've been talking about the issues that confront everyday Floridians not you know frankly jumping in the swamp with with the press let me ask you that more directly here because the Santa says I didn't say anything to do a trace it had nothing to do with race do you believe that what he said was racist do you believe that he is racist iiiii don't want to jump to name-calling at this stage of the race and I'm hoping that they will try to avoid it as well I don't however believe that the congressman was in any way frankly trying to back away from what he was suggesting that he was doing which was in my opinion playing a little bit of a race card there I wish you wouldn't however because I think he can be better than that I think the president has been a horrible example when it comes to these kinds of issues and quite frankly it's not what Florida voters want to hear right now they want to hear what we're going to do to address affordable housing clean up our environment which right now we've got guacamole algae flowing out of the east and the west side of this state instead of talking about quote unquote monkey and things up which I've never even heard that phrase certainly not used in the context of his conversation that he would stick to what's important and that's what we're gonna do to improve the state of Florida so when you did hear that phrase mayor what did you think well I tell you first of all I've really tried to stay on a high as it relates to what was for us a pretty amazing victory the other night I mean really nobody thought we could pull this thing off we probably raised a total of six million dollars compared to my four opponents who raised and spent over ninety million dollars no one saw it coming but we did the hard work we worked steady we engaged voters we talked to them about the issues I went to red areas blue areas purple areas of the state I was really trying to continue to ride that high of a conversation and unfortunately mr. DeSantis went immediately to the gutter again I thought it was inappropriate but I certainly think that he's shown us very well where he wants to take this race he's I think staking his race on quite frankly following Trump's PlayBook and that is going to the gutter and and I hope that as we complete these next ten weeks that he'll find a new North Star I certainly plan on staying staying high here and I invite him to join me on some higher ground there's a couple of other topics I want to get to you mayor but just to wrap up this part of the conversation quickly here he says he's not going to apologize do you want him to apologize and would you accept an apology well he doesn't need to apologize to me he needs to apologize the Florida voters because if he thinks that those kind of shenanigans are going to be persuasive enough in this midterm election to turn this their way I think he's badly mistaken thank you for checking out our YouTube channel why don't you subscribe it's really easy just click on that button down there and for more news from MSNBC click on any of these videos here for the latest interviews and highlights you can get more videos from MSNBC with our newsletters head over to msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up
