>> THEY HAVE DESTROYED A
MAN'S REPUTATION, AND THEY
WANT TO DESTROY IT EVEN
MORE.
AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO SEE THAT IN THE MID
TERMS.
IF WE BROUGHT GEORGE
WASHINGTON HERE, AND WE SAID
WE HAVE GEORGE WASHINGTON,
THE DEMOCRATS WOULD VOTE
AGAINST HIM.
36 YEARS, THERE'S NO CHARGE.
ALL OF A SUDDEN THE HEARINGS
ARE OVER, AND THE RUMORS
START COMING OUT.
AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS OTHER
CON ARTIST, AVENATTI COME
OUT WITH ANOTHER BEAUTY
TODAY.
THIS IS JUST A GAME THAT
THEY'RE PLAYING.
IT'S A CON GAME.
IT'S AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.
STEVE: IT IS AT THE HIGHEST
LEVELS.
WHAT HAPPENS TODAY DOWN IN
WASHINGTON WILL EFFECTIVELY
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS THE NEXT
JUSTICE TO SIT ON THE U.S.
SUPREME COURT.
KELLYANNE, COUNSELOR TO THE
PRESIDENT IS LIVE FROM THE
NORTH LAWN TODAY.
KELLYANNE, WE HAVE GOT ALL
THESE ACCUSATIONS NOW AT THE
11TH HOUR.
WE HAVE GOT TWO GUYS WHO
CAME OUT TO THE SENATE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND THEY
SAID WE THINK SHE IS
MISTAKEN BECAUSE WE WOULD
LIKE TO SAY WE ASSAULTED
HER, WHICH, YOU KNOW, WE
HADN'T HEARD THAT UNTIL THIS
MORNING.
WHAT'S YOUR HEADLINE FROM
THIS VERY BUSY THURSDAY
MORNING?
>> THAT BOTH DOCTOR FORD AND
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL BE
HEARD TODAY UNDER OATH AND
THAT THEY MAY BOTH BE RIGHT.
THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING VERY
AWFUL HAPPEN TO HER WHEN SHE
WAS 15 AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH
WAS NOT THERE AND WAS NOT
INVOLVED WHATSOEVER.
THAT REALLY DOES GO TO
CREDIBILITY.
THEY COULD BOTH BE CORRECT.
BUT I THINK THERE IS SO MUCH
BEEN SAID AND WRITTEN AND
DONE WITH RESPECT TO FORD
AND KAVANAUGH, THAT I WANT
TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS, IF I
MAY THIS MORNING ON THE
JUDGE JURY AND EXECUTIONERS,
THOSE WOULD BE THE DEMOCRATS
ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE WHO THROUGH OVER
THE COURSE OF 30 HOURS OF
SWORN TESTIMONY WITH JUDGE
KAVANAUGH ALREADY PUT ON
SUCH SPECTACLE AND CIRCUS
LONG BEFORE WE HAD A
CONVERSATION, LONG BEFORE
THE COUNTRY KNEW WHO
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD IS.
AND THESE FOLKS, SOME OF
WHOM TOOK CAMPAIGN DONATIONS
FROM HARVEY WEINSTEIN,
PALLED AROUND WITH BILL
COSBY AND GOING TO JAIL FOR
BEING A SEXUAL PREDATOR FOR
ASSAULTING SOMEONE
CRIMINALLY.
THREE OF THEM VOTING TO
REFUSE TO MOVE BILL CLINTON
FROM OFFICE FOR HAVING SEX
WITH AN INTERN RIGHT BEHIND
ME IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
I WANT EVERYBODY TO SEE WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT TO THEM.
THIS IS HYPER PARTISANSHIP,
HOTTIE, HYPOCRITICAL HAPLESS
DEMOCRATS ON THE SENATE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHO IS
THE PRESIDENT IS ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT HERE TO DESTROY A MAN.
THEY ARE MAD THAT THE SWING
VOTE ON THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT COULD BE TAKEN
OVER BY A DONALD TRUMP
APPOINTEE TO THE SUPREME
COURT.
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
AND I WOULD HAVE MORE
RESPECT FOR THEM IF THEY
SAID I DON'T LIKE THE WAY HE
COMBS HIS HAIR THAN COMING
IN AT THE 12TH HOUR WITH
THIS.
BECAUSE THEY HAVE RUINED --
THEY HAVE RUINED A COUPLE OF
LIVES HERE BY SITTING ON
THIS INFORMATION.
THIS WOMAN DIDN'T WANT TO
COME FORWARD.
THEY SMOKED HER OUT.
THEY LEAKED HER IDENTITY.
BUT FOR THE REPUBLICANS ON
THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE IN THE MAJORITY,
DR. FORD MAY NEVER HAVE EVEN
HAD TODAY TO TESTIFY.
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD
BE HEARD FROM BEFORE.
SO EVERYBODY SHOULD BE
WATCHING THEM.
THEY ARE NOT UNDER OATH
TODAY.
I WOULD LIKE TO PUT THE
SENATORS UNDER OATH NOT JUST
THE TESTIFIERS.
BRIAN: TRUE OR FALSE BEHIND
THE DISEENS YOU WOULD BE
BEHIND THE SCENES AS MUCH AS
ANYBODY.
UPSET WITH REPUBLICANS FOR
NOT BEING STRONGER FOR
DRAGGING THIS OUT.
BECAUSE HE DRAGGED IT OUT
ALL THESE OTHER ALLEGATIONS
HAVE COME OUT.
HAS THAT CORRECTLY
CHARACTERIZING THE
PRESIDENT'S DEMEANOR?
>> FROM THE BEGINNING WE
HAVE SAID THAT THIS IS THE
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S
PROCESS.
THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT
WORKS BEST.
THEY HAVE GONE OVER AND
ABOVE TO ACCOMMODATE
DR. FORD.
SHE HAD A LAUNDRY LIST OF
DEMANDS INCLUDING FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN AMERICAN
JURISPRUDENCE BEING THE
ACCUSER BUT GOING SECOND.
WHAT IS JUDGE KAVANAUGH
SUPPOSED TO RESPOND TO?
A "THE WASHINGTON POST"
REPORT?
MEDIA RUMORS INSTEAD OF
SWORN TESTIMONY THAT SHE
WOULD GIVE RESPOND TO?
THEY HAVE ACCOMMODATED HER
REQUEST OVER THE COURSE OF
11 DAYS NOW.
AND I THINK THAT MY BOSS
MOVES AT A PACE THAT MOST
PEOPLE ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED
TO.
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN
TREATED VERY FAIRLY BY THE
PROCESS.
HE HAS RAISE HIS RIGHT HAND
AND TESTIFY FROM WHEN HE
HEARD THE ANONYMOUS
ACCUSATION AS HE HAS
CHARACTERIZED IT AFTER
HEARING THIS WOMAN'S
IDENTITY FOR THE FIRST TIME,
THE VERY SAME DAY, HE WENT
AND GAVE SWORN TESTIMONY TO
THE COMMITTEE BY PHONE.
SO HE HAS BEEN WILLING,
UNDER PENALTY OF EITHER
PERJURY OR LYING TO
CONGRESS, HE HAS BEEN
WILLING, AGAIN AND AGAIN, TO
TESTIFY, SO HE HAS BEEN
WAITING FOR 11 DAYS.
WE KNOW WHAT BOTH OF THEM
ARE GOING TO SAY.
THEIR STATEMENTS ARE ALL FOR
THE PUBLIC TO SEE.
I THINK THE PROCESS HAS BEEN
VERY ACCOMMODATING FOR VERY
UNIQUE AND UNUSUAL
SITUATION.
BUT, EVERYTHING THAT THE
LEFT HAS SAID THAT THEY ARE
CONCERNED IN HERE, GETTING
TO THE TRUTH, HAVING HER BE
HEARD, NOT HAVING HER BE
IGNORED AND INSULTED.
I'M THE ONE WHO 10 DAYS AGO
SAID DON'T INSULT HER AND
DON'T IGNORE HER.
HERE 10 DAYS LATER THEY ARE
GOING TO TESTIFY.
THE FACT THAT THIS MORNING
THE "U.S.A. TODAY" CAME OUT
WITH THE SWORN TESTIMONY OR
THE INTERVIEWS BY SOME IN
THE SENATE WITH THESE TWO
MEN WHO SAY IT WAS THEM,
THEY WERE THERE AND THEY HAD
SEXUAL CONTACT OR OEA
ASSAULTED.
I DIDN'T READ EVERYTHING SO
I WANT TO BE CAREFUL HERE.
THAT'S BIG NEWS.
THE OTHER THING IS FOR THESE
GANG RAPE ALLEGATIONS, I
WOULD TELL THAT WOMAN GO
MARCH DOWN TO THE MONTGOMERY
COUNTY COURTHOUSE TODAY AND
FILE YOUR CLAIM.
BECAUSE, AS I UNDERSTAND IT
AS A FULLY RECOVERED
ATTORNEY OF MANY YEARS, SEX
CRIMES HAVE NO STATUTE OF
LIMITATIONS IN MARYLAND.
SO, WHY IS SHE NOT WHY
DIDN'T SHE YEARS AGO OR WHY
ISN'T SHE EVEN NOW TRYING TO
GET THAT PROSECUTED THERE.
IS IT BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A
LOT OF EVIDENCE OF THAT?
WE CAN'T JUST HAVE A TRIAL
BY TV ON TV AND THROUGH THE
PRESS THEY TRY TO DO THAT
AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH SOME
PEOPLE.
IT WON'T HAPPEN HERE.
BRETT KAVANAUGH WILL RAISE
HIS RIGHT HAND AS HE HAS
SOME TIMES THROUGHOUT HIS
ADULT LIFE SWEARING AN OATH
TO THE CONSTITUTION WHEN HE
WAS SWORN IN AS ASSISTANT TO
THE PRESIDENT HERE IN THE
WHITE HOUSE.
AS HE WAS SWORN IN TO THE
SECOND HIGHEST COURT, THE
D.C. CIRCUIT.
PLEDGING AN OATH TO THE
CONSTITUTION TO BE HONEST.
HE WILL DO THAT AGAIN TODAY,
SWEARING TO TELL THE TRUTH,
THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
INCLUDING THE DEMOCRATS ON
IT WHO SAID THEY WOULD VOTE
AGAINST THIS MAN LONG BEFORE
KNOWING WHO THESE ACCUSERS
ARE.
THEY SHOULD ALSO TELL THE
TRUTH.
THEY SHOULD TELL THE TRUTH
IN THEIR SO-CALLED PURSUIT
OF THE TRUTH.
AINSLEY: KELLYANNE, EVEN IF
HE IS INNOCENT, IT'S A
SHAME -- IF HE IS INNOCENT,
IT'S A SHAME THAT HIS
REPUTATION IS TAINTED.
BUT I'M HEARING NOW FROM
JUST CONVERSATIONS, WHEN YOU
HAVE CONVERSATIONS AT THE
DINNER TABLE OR GET IN A
TAXI AND NEW YORK AND PEOPLE
ARE TALKING ABOUT, THIS
THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS
HAPPENING ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY, ARE PEOPLE NOW
GOING TO THE PRESIDENT OR IS
THE PRESIDENT NOW TELLING
YOU THAT HE IS CONSIDERING
NOMINATING SOMEONE ELSE?
NO MATTER WHAT IF HE IS
INNOCENT?
HIS REPUTATION IS STILL
TAINTED.
PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY MADE UP
THEIR MINDS.
YOU HAVE A LOFT DEMOCRATS
ALREADY SAYING THEY BELIEVE
THESE WOMEN ARE TELLING THE
TRUTH.
LET'S SAY HE IS UP FOR A
VOTE OR FRIDAY.
HE DOESN'T MAKE IT THROUGH.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
IS THE PRESIDENT TELLING YOU
HE IS GOING TO NOMINATE
SOMEONE ELSE BEFORE THE MID
TERMS?
>> I'M SORRY, AINSLEY,
THAT'S A COMPLETE HILL AT
THIS POINT BECAUSE THE
PRESIDENT IS STANDING BY
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE
RECEIVE THESE TESTIMONIES
TODAY FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD
TO SEE.
AND THEN AS I READ IT THE
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
WILL HAVE A VOTE AND IF WHEN
JUDGE KAVANAUGH MAKES IT OUT
OF COMMITTEE, I GUESS WHEN
THEY SCHEDULE THE NEXT VOTE
THROUGH THE WEEKEND OR NEXT
WEEK WHEN THE SUPREME COURT
SITS FOR ITS NEXT TERM THEN
WE WILL KNOW WHETHER JUDGE
KAVANAUGH HAS ENOUGH VOTE TO
MAKE IT TO THE COURT.
STEVE: SURE.
>> BEFORE THAT EVERYTHING IS
SPECULATION.
HONESTLY IT PLAYS INTO THE
MEDIA GAME.
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA GAME OF
PALACE INTRIGUE AND
PERSONNEL AND PERSONALITIES
INSTEAD OF PRINCIPLES.
YOU HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP IN
HIS OWN WORDS, IN HIS OWN
VOICE LAST NIGHT SAY THAT
THIS IS A SHAM AND A SHAME.
AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO A
MAN AND HIS WIFE AND HIS
CHILDREN.
AND LET ME JUST MAKE VERY
CLEAR.
BRETT KAVANAUGH LIVES IN
THIS AREA, JUDGE NEIL
GORSUCH CAME FROM COLORADO.
WE ALL LIVE IN THIS AREA.
I KNOW CURRENT GEORGETOWN
PREP STUDENTS AND PARENTS.
WE ALL TALK TO EACH OTHER.
WE ARE ALL POLITICALLY
DIFFERENT.
WE ARE ALL VERY DIFFERENT.
BUT WE ARE ALL -- WE ARE
ALL -- MAINSTREAM MEDIA WHO
LIVES HERE THINK THEY CAN
RUN INTO BRETT KAVANAUGH AND
ASHLEY KAVANAUGH AND THOSE
TWO YOUNG GIRLS IN THE LOCAL
GROCERY STORE, THE COFFEE
SHOP.
AND THEY CAN LIVE WITH
THEMSELVES THE WAY THEY HAVE
TREATED HIM.
JUST HIM, DON'T TALK ABOUT
THE ACCUSERS FOR A MOVEMENT
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE
PROCESS.
AND DON'T TALK ABOUT THE
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE
SUPREME COURT, HAVE YOU SEEN
SOME OF THESE SENATORS?
FOLKS KEEP ON ELECTING THEM.
THEY EFFECTIVELY HAVE
LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS TO THE
UNITED STATES SENATE.
IF THEY CAN LIVE WITH
THEMSELVES THE WAY THEY HAVE
TREATED A HUMAN BEING AND
THEY CAN LOOK THEIR KIDS IN
THE EYE AND SAY I WOULD -- I
TREATED HIM AS A HUMAN BEING
THE WAY I WOULD WANTS YOU TO
BE TREATED, I WOULD REALLY
LIKE THAT -- I KNOW YOU SEE
ME OUT HERE AS COUNSELOR TO
THE PRESIDENT ON TV OFTEN,
DOING LOTS OF THINGS INSIDE,
BY THE PRESIDENT'S SIDE FOR
OVER TWO AND A HALF YEARS
NOW.
I'M ALSO THE MOTHER OF FOUR
SCHOOL AGED SCHOOL CHILDREN
INCLUDING AN ALMOST
14-YEAR-OLD SON.
THE CONVERSATIONS BEING HAD
IN THE SUBURBS AMONG WOMEN
ARE NOT JUST ABOUT THOSE
ACCUSERS.
IT'S ABOUT THE ACCUSED.
AND THE IMPLICATIONS THIS
CAN HAVE TO ALL THE BOYS AND
MEN IN OUR LIVES.
STEVE: SURE.
KELLYANNE, YOU ARE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
WASHINGTON IS A SMALL TOWN.
YOU BUMP INTO PEOPLE
EVERYWHERE.
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT
THE PRESIDENT SAID YESTERDAY
AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE.
AND HE WAS VERY CLEAR.
IS HE STANDING BEHIND BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
AT THE SAME TIME HE WANTS TO
HEAR DR. FORD AND HER
TESTIMONY.
BUT A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF
THE PRESS WERE ASKING WHY
ARE YOU SO SKEPTICAL,
MR. PRESIDENT, ABOUT THE
STORIES OF THESE ACCUSERS?
AND HE SAID, LOOK, I HAVE
BEEN ACCUSED FALSELY, HE
SAYS, MANY, MANY TIMES.
SO I KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT
FEELS.
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.
AND HE ALSO MADE REFERENCE
TO SOMETHING I'M SURE PEOPLE
HAD FORGOTTEN DURING THE
TRANSITION THAT IT WAS
REVEALED THAT MONEY WAS
OFFERED TO WOMEN TO COME
FORWARD AND MAKE THESE
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THEN
CANDIDATE TRUMP.
SO HE THEN KNOWS HOW IT
FEELS.
LET ME MAKE ONE
CLARIFICATION.
THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING
ABOUT THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE
PROCESS.
AGAIN SAYING SKEPTICAL OF
THE ACCUSERS.
IS HE SKEPTICAL OF THE WAY
THIS PROCESS HAS ROLLED OUT
NOT JUST IN THE SENATE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN THE
12TH HOUR A MAN WHO HAS
SUCCESSFULLY UNDERGONE SIX
THOROUGH VETS BY THE FBI.
AND THEY ARE THOROUGH, TRUST
ME.
TALK TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS
EVER KNOWN YOU.
GO THROUGH LOTS OF PAPERS AS
WELL AS THEY SHOULD.
HE SUCCEEDED THAT WAY.
NO ONE EVER CAME FORWARD FOR
36 YEARS.
TALKING ABOUT ALLEGATIONS OF
CONDUCT AS A TEENAGER.
BECAME A POWERFUL MAN ALONG
WITH FEMALE LAW CLERKS AND
THEY SUPPORT HIM.
NOT A SCINTILLA, NOT A WHIFF
OF AN ALLEGATION.
AND SO THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO
TALKING ABOUT THE UNFAIRNESS
OF THE PROCESS.
THAT SOMEBODY CAN SUBMIT
ANSWERS TO 1300 WRITTEN
QUESTIONS, PRODUCE OVER
1 MILLION DOCUMENTS.
HAVE 30 HOURS PLUS OF SWORN
TESTIMONY TO THE SAME
COMMITTEE.
AND SIT AND HAVE AUTHORED
OVER 300 OPINIONS THAT
EVERYBODY HAS SCOURED.
OVER 300 OPINIONS HAVE THAT
HAVE BEEN SCRUTINIZED OVER
TIME ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT.
AND NOTHING.
SO THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO
SAYING IT'S UNFAIR AND THE
PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.
GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN IN THE
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOMINATED TO
THE SUPREME COURT BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP?
IT'S TERRIBLE TO TRY TO
SHAME AND BLAME AND NAME
PEOPLE MERELY BECAUSE OF WHO
IS NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME
COURT.
THE PRESIDENT IS TOUGH.
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS TOUGH.
HE WANTS TO CLEAR HIS NAME
AS HE TOLD YOUR COLLEAGUE,
MARTHA MACCALLUM, AND I HOPE
HE SHOWS SOME RIGHTEOUS
INDIGNATION TODAY.
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR
HIM.
HE IS NOT A POLITICIAN LIKE
THE POLITICIANS HE WILL BE
FACING.
HE IS NOT A SLICK PERSON ON
TV WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY FOR
THE CAMERAS.
IS HE A JUDGE AND PUBLIC
SERVANT.
BRIAN: GOTCHA.
KELLYANNE.
>> HE DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS
EITHER.
I'M GLAD THEY ARE GOING TO
BE THERE.
BRIAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE THAT COULD OR
COULD NOT BE HAPPENING
TODAY.
WE THOUGHT IT WAS ON THE
SCHEDULE THE PRESIDENT
INDICATED IT MIGHT BE PUT
OFF.
THAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S
ONE-ON-ONE WITH DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD
ROSENSTEIN WHO CAME TO THE
WHITE HOUSE MONDAY WILD
SPECULATION HE WAS ABOUT TO
BE FIRED OR RESIGN.
NOW THEY ARE GOING TO MEET
THURSDAY.
STEVE: TODAY.
BRIAN: TODAY.
MAYBE MEET FOR THE FIRST
TIME SINCE THE ARTICLE CAME
OUT SAYING HE CONSIDERED THE
25TH AMENDMENT WEARING A
WIRE TO TRY TO SET THE
PRESIDENT UP TO SHOW HE IS
INCOMPETENT AND OUST HIM
ALONG WITH ANDY MCCABE.
I'M JUST WONDERING TODAY IF
THAT MEETING COMES OFF IS
THERE ANY INDICATION FROM
THE PRESIDENT WHICH WAY HE
WILL GO.
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE
WOULD PREFER THAT THE DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL STAY ON THE
JOB AND GET THE JOB DONE.
THOSE WERE HIS WORDS
YESTERDAY.
AT THE SAME TIME, THE
PRESIDENT AND THE DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE VOWED
TO ME THOSE TWO MEN ARE
GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THE
CONVERSATION.
THE PRESIDENT, I KNOW FIRST
HAND WILL ASK THE TOUGH
QUESTIONS.
WILL WANT ALL THE TRUTHFUL
ANSWERS.
AND THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY
GENERAL HAS DENIED THIS.
STEVE: IS IT TODAY?
>> IT'S SCHEDULED FOR TODAY.
THE PRESIDENT IS FLYING BACK
FROM UNGA WHERE HE HAD A
VERY SUCCESSFUL FEW DAYS AT
UNGA AND HE WILL COME BACK
HERE AND A LOT ON HIS DOCKET
INCLUDING MEETING WITH THE
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL.
IF IT NEEDS TO GET PUSHED A
FEW HOURS OR MAYBE TO THE
NEXT DAY THEY WILL.
THEY ARE BOTH COMMITTED TO
SPEAKING WITH EACH OTHER AND
RESOLVING THIS ONCE AND FOR
ALL.
BRIAN: YOUR OBSERVATION,
BECAUSE I TALKED TO ONE OF
ROD ROSENSTEIN'S FRIENDS
YESTERDAY.
HE SAID THAT THE PERCEPTION
IS THAT THEY DON'T GET
ALONG.
HE SAID BUT ROD ROSENSTEIN
TOLD HIM THEY DO GET ALONG.
THEY AGREE ON ONE THING.
ANDY MCCABE CANNOT BE
TRUSTED AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
THEY HAVE ALMOST BEEN
GALVANIZED TOGETHER.
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU
COULD GET BEHIND, TOO?
>> IT'S A VERY FAIR POINT.
I HAVE BEEN IN MEETINGS VERY
RECENTLY WITH BOTH THE
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND
THE PRESIDENT.
THERE IS A GREAT EXCHANGE OF
INFORMATION ON THE ISSUES
AFFECTING THIS COUNTRY
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS
HERE WITH A CABINET MEETING
WITH GENERAL KELLY AND
OTHERS.
I THINK SOME IN THE MEDIA
GOT CAUGHT BETWEEN IS IT
FIRING AND RESIGNATION HOW
ABOUT IS IT A MEETING?
I HOME THEY FERRETED OUT OUT
LEAKERS.
I HOPE THEY FIND OUT WHO
LEAKED THE INFORMATION.
I WOULD LOVE THAT WHAT I
WOULD SAY IN ADDITION IS
THERE A POINT TO BE MADE
ABOUT MCCABE.
WHEN ROD ROSENSTEIN AUTHORED
THAT LETTER ON MAY 9TH,
2017, GO BACK AND READ IT.
IT REALLY GOES WAY ABOVE AND
BEYOND A SIMPLE, I THINK
IT'S TIME FOR COMEY TO GO.
HE SAYS WHY.
HE SAYS THAT JIM COMEY AS
FBI DIRECTOR TOTALLY USURPED
THE POSITION AND RIGHTS OF
THE THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL
LORETTA LYNCH.
THAT JIM COMEY DID THE
TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT
TO DO ONCE THE INVESTIGATION
IN THIS CASE, THE EMAIL
INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY
CLINTON.
HE SAID THAT THE MISHANDLING
OF THE EMAIL INVESTIGATION
BY JIM COMEY HAD BROUGHT
TOGETHER PEOPLE DOJ AND FBI
PEOPLE MAD AT ROD
ROSENSTEIN.
I SEE A TREND HERE.
JIM COMEY HEAD OF THE FBI
GOT FIRED, HAD NOTES, GOT A
BOOK DEAL AND LEAKED THE
NOTES TO THE MEDIA.
ANDY MCCABE GOT FIRED, HAD
NOTES, GOT A BOOK DEAL AND
LEAKED THE NOTES TO THE
MEDIA.
I SEE A TREND HERE.
WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT TOO.
NEVER UNDER ESTIMATE THE
POWER OF PEOPLE'S EGGOS AND
SELF-IDOLATRY.
BRIAN: OF COURSE THE LISA
PAGE AND PETER STRZOK LOVE
