00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,073
- Hi.

2
00:00:01,073 --> 00:00:03,160
Thank you for your speech,
it's good and refreshing.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,230
I'm a Christian.

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,350
So, this is something
that I'm actually very

5
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,610
passionate about and I talk
to a lot of friends about.

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,100
And the big pushback that
I get, when I say things,

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,940
like when I talk about
Christianity or Islam

8
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,013
or Sharia Law, things like that.

9
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,010
Bill Warner, I reference
a lot of his stuff.

10
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,250
I get a lot of pushback and they kind of

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,920
make the religions the same.

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,753
- [Speaker] Right.

13
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:27,260
- And they don't
necessarily understand that

14
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,210
they have completely different teachings.

15
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,460
It's not just like they carry the same

16
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,540
universal morality.

17
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,452
So, what advice would you give to

18
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:36,570
break that barrier?

19
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,560
I've done the, actually
going through the teachings

20
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,820
and then I just got called a bigot

21
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,740
and an Islamaphobe,
even though I'm quoting

22
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,470
the Koran or things like that.

23
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,830
So, what kind of advice would you have to

24
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,140
kind of break down that barrier

25
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,860
and try and reach some middle ground?

26
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,050
- You were hate reading.

27
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,770
You were hate reading scripture at them.

28
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,603
Oh, that's.

29
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:55,270
How dare you, that's terrible.

30
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,070
There is this bizarre place where.

31
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,080
Jerry Seinfeld said he's not going to

32
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,800
play college campuses anymore,

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,900
because the kids don't want to laugh.

34
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,800
They just want to call
things racist and sexist.

35
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,650
And it's the same.

36
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,510
They don't want to learn about Islam

37
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,440
or Christianity or any other
religion, for that matter.

38
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,230
They just want to call you a bigot,

39
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,340
because their religion is politics.

40
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,720
It's a real perversion of what we've been

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,060
talking about all night.

42
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,700
There is religion and
downstream there is culture

43
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,370
and downstream there is politics.

44
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,310
But this awful materialism,
this awful relativism,

45
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,250
this awful post-modernism, use
whatever -ism you want here.

46
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,360
Instead of looking up and
the culture worshiping

47
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,730
what is of the cult, it looks down

48
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,520
and it worships the politics.

49
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,380
Feminists did this in the 1960's

50
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,600
and said, "The political is personal,

51
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,590
the personal is political".

52
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,440
This worship of that, because everybody

53
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,740
has got to serve somebody.

54
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,273
So, I would always begin
from a position of humility.

55
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,050
The least informed are usually the loudest

56
00:01:58,193 --> 00:01:59,690
and it's an important realization when you

57
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,590
realize you don't know
very much, compared to

58
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,423
other people.

59
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:03,673
I would do it that way.

60
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,760
I would ask them.

61
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,730
Sometimes I get asked about abortion

62
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,340
and they say, "But it's not
a life and it's not a this

63
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,180
and it's not a that".

64
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,360
I say, "How sure are you? How
sure? Because I don't know.

65
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,560
Maybe it's not a morally dignified life.

66
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,170
Maybe there is only a 5% chance.

67
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,300
Are you willing to risk that?

68
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,090
That's a million people a
year that you are killing.

69
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,900
Are you willing to take a 5% chance?".

70
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,930
I would approach it in that
way and just ask questions.

71
00:02:27,930 --> 00:00:00,000
They'll stop sputtering at some
point or they'll walk away.
