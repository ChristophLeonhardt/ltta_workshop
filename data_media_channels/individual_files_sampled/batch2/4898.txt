I'm Joey nobody sent the accident former federal prosecutor Barry Grisman former US attorney thank you all and you've all been thinking about this cases we have been covering it I want something Cynthia then to Barry when you're looking at Cohen the guy he is not a nice guy he comes across a sympathetic however looks like he's sad he's going down what do you hear his attorney what are you thinking about a partner you're thinking about copping a plea to Tamar were you thinking about this because he's got these huge charges against him in terms of bank fraud and failure to pay honestly pay taxes honestly to pay directed to report campaign expenditures the whole bank and they get him they couldn't get him well he's gonna have to make a deal he has nowhere else to go he's pushed himself away from Trump he doesn't have the same flexibility because Trump can't really pardon him because he has he potentially has state charges I'll tell you what he's learned so much oh yeah I'll tell you what he's got that that mana Ford doesn't have he has relationships and deals with Trump's kids if he can if he can give the prosecutor something on Trump's kids now you've got a pressure point that is very different from what mana Ford could do and that is pressure on the president yeah I what you do you share my intuition that the last thing he wants is to come into the presidency run for the president win the presidency serve a year and that the bottom line in family terms put his kids in jail he's not gonna put his kids in jail I mean I think that's the only redeeming quality of the guy that he would he would give up the presidency they free them yes is that a deal you can make I don't know it depends on what you know can you make a lock I mean can you cut a deal saying okay because I know a guy the one you could promise never to run for office again people resign and as prosecutions are dropped oh you mean could Muller make motor to make whatever deal he wants yeah you walk you're gone you give up the presidency maybe I mean but that's what's different about : okay that's about this other guy manna for Barry metaphor it's looking at huge time we don't know what that jury is up to so I'm sure look I'm not a lawyer I said a million times but you're thinking of it you got it you're representing man affordably facing this serious time if he does get a hung jury how does that change things because they're three days in now well first of all I don't think being three days in as a critical amount of time I mean this jury has been asked to review a lot of complex tax information they've probably never heard of banking laws dealing with the foreign banking entities so they they're I would say that they're doing a good job as far as weeding through all the various and accounts and matching up the evidence with each count if we are still talking like this a week from now I think mr. manna for should be happy because that means somebody is holding out but I've got a feeling within the next couple of days we'll have a verdict do you think that judge has been fair and not helping them wade through all this paper they've got all these exhibits they've got a they've got a crosswalk those exhibits to the particular charges and trying to understand what evidence they really have and where it applies he said I'm not going to help you with that I mean it seems to me that puts a tremendous strain on regular civilian jurors the figure this thing it really does I mean because because the lawyers are there they're basically teaching the jury what this case is about yeah and if some of your teaching mechanisms of tools are taken away from you it only harms your case whether you're the prosecution or the defendant what do you think Cynthia watching them do you think it's benefit I just watched this judge constantly put his finger on the scale to help the defendant well it they're so obsessed in Alexandria with getting through quickly quickly quickly quickly he's not here one day in the whole jury well the broad ear I'm not as concerned about as that they could not publish the exhibits to the jury so now the jury is totally confused about what exhibits go with what hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
