1
00:00:01,724 --> 00:00:02,124
FORGIVENESS.

2
00:00:02,124 --> 00:00:04,360
GREAT TO SEE HE IS DOING SO MUCH

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,762
TO HELP OTHERS.

4
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:08,164
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

5
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:09,965
CONGRESSMAN ERIC SWALWELL,

6
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:11,100
DEMOCRAT FROM SAN FRANCISCO BAY,

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,335
HAS A SOLUTION FOR GUN VIOLENCE.

8
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:15,771
HE SAYS "WE SHOULD BAN

9
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:17,239
POSSESSION OF MILITARY STYLE

10
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:17,973
SEMIAUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPONS.

11
00:00:17,973 --> 00:00:22,578
WE SHOULD BUY BACK SUCH WEAPONS.

12
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:23,546
AND WE SHOULD CRIMINALLY

13
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:25,414
PROSECUTE ANY WHO CHOOSE TO D

14
00:00:25,414 --> 00:00:27,116
FIRED BY KEEPING THEIR WEAPONS."

15
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:31,687
THE BAND WOULD NOT APPLY TO

16
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:34,023
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OR

17
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:34,690
SHOOTING CLUBS.

18
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,560
WE ARE JOINED BY EMILY MILLER.

19
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,562
SHE IS IN DALLAS AT THE NRA

20
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:40,362
CONVENTION WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP

21
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:41,964
IS SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS THE

22
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:43,365
EVENT TOMORROW.

23
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:44,166
EMILY, GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH

24
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:44,767
US.

25
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:47,169
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT PLAN?

26
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:47,803
SOUNDS LIKE CONFISCATION.

27
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:50,606
>> IT IS EXACTLY.

28
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:52,775
I HOPE THAT CONGRESSMAN GOES

29
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:53,509
PERSONALLY TO CHECK EVERYBODY'S

30
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:54,276
HOUSE IN AMERICA TO SEE IF THEY

31
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:55,945
HAVE AN AR-15.

32
00:00:55,945 --> 00:00:57,480
THAT WILL GO OVER REAL WELL.

33
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,849
YOU KNOW I'M KIDDING.

34
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:02,751
OBVIOUSLY IT'S RIDICULOUS.

35
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:04,352
WE DON'T HAVE A NATIONAL

36
00:01:04,352 --> 00:01:04,953
REGISTRY.

37
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:06,555
THIS IS NOT HITLER.

38
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:06,989
IT'S NOT CUBA.

39
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:07,857
WE DON'T HAVE A NATIONAL

40
00:01:07,857 --> 00:01:08,224
REGISTRY.

41
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:10,059
WE DON'T KNOW WHO OWNS THESE

42
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:10,559
GUNS.

43
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:11,660
I CAN PROMISE YOU AS A GUN OWNER

44
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:23,672
AND COMING HERE SPEAKING TO TENS

45
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:24,406
OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER PROUD GUN

46
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:25,074
OWNERS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE

47
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:25,774
SECOND AMENDMENT, THEY ARE NOT

48
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:26,475
GOING TO TURN IN THEIR AR-15s.

49
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:27,910
>> Shannon: LET ME TALK TO

50
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:28,210
YOU --

51
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,311
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME

52
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:29,979
POLLING WE HAVE.

53
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,380
WE SAW SPIKE AND THOSE WHO

54
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,848
THOUGHT WE NEED TOUGHER GUN

55
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:34,617
CONTROL LAWS IN THIS

56
00:01:34,617 --> 00:01:35,151
COUNTRY.

57
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:36,152
OF COURSE AFTER THE PARKLAND

58
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:36,585
EVENT.

59
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:38,154
IT WAS TRAGIC.

60
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:40,189
THERE WERE YOUNG PEOPLE LOST.

61
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:41,757
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ADVOCATING.

62
00:01:41,757 --> 00:01:42,791
THEY HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF

63
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:43,192
ATTENTION.

64
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:44,994
THAT HAS DROPPED OFF, LIKE IT

65
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:47,596
ALWAYS DOES AFTER THE EVENTS.

66
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:49,999
56% OF PEOPLE SAY THEY SUPPORT

67
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:52,434
TOUGHER GUN LAWS.

68
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:53,202
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THOSE

69
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:55,237
NUMBERS?

70
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:58,107
>> OBVIOUSLY THESE RARE MASS

71
00:01:58,107 --> 00:01:59,208
SHOOTINGS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN

72
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,409
PARKLAND AND WHAT HAPPENED AT

73
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,344
SANDY HOOK YEARS AGO AS WELL,

74
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:03,412
WHAT HAPPENED IN SUTHERLAND

75
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:04,446
SPRINGS CHURCH HERE IN TEXAS,

76
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:08,584
THEY ARE RARE.

77
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:10,752
IT'S GENERALLY ON AVERAGE AND

78
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:12,388
GOVERNMENT FIGURES,

79
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:13,522
CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE,

80
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:15,991
LESS THAN 50 PEOPLE A YEAR ON

81
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:16,325
AVERAGE.

82
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:17,760
THE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN BAD.

83
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,395
WE'VE HAD LAS VEGAS, PARKLAND,

84
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:23,365
REALLY TERRIBLE TRAGEDIES.

85
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:24,567
THEY WERE LONE WOLVES.

86
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:25,768
THEY ARE NOT TERRORISTS.

87
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:28,170
THIS IS NOT INTERCITY CRIME.

88
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,173
OF THE TEN OR 11,000 PEOPLE A

89
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:34,376
YEAR KILLED BY GUNS, HOMICIDE

90
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:36,845
BY GUN, ABOUT 300 TOTAL ARE

91
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:40,082
BY RIFLES.

92
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:42,151
THE ISSUE ON GUN VIOLENCE IS

93
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:44,186
INTERCITY GUN VIOLENCE AND

94
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:44,954
HANDGUNS.

95
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:46,388
>> Shannon: WHY DON'T YOU

96
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:47,756
THINK THAT GETS TALKED ABOUT?

97
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:49,825
DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL

98
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:50,359
ADDRESS IT TOMORROW?

99
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:52,628
>> I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOING TO

100
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:53,629
GET INTO THE DETAILS.

101
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:57,399
HE IS A BIG PICTURE GUY.

102
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:59,201
IT DOESN'T GET TALKED ABOUT

103
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:00,202
BECAUSE THE LEFT GETS ENERGIZED,

104
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:01,470
AND YOU HEARD CHRIS TALK ABOUT

105
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,973
THIS A MINUTE TO GO, THE LEFT IS

106
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:04,873
ENERGIZED BY THE IDEA OF GETTING

107
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:06,508
ALL OUR GUNS.

108
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:08,744
THEY LOVE THE IDEA.

109
00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:10,379
THEY BRING UP GUN VIOLENCE.

110
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,680
YOU WILL HEAR AUSTRALIA TO THE

111
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,649
POINT WHERE I HAD TO NEW TO THE

112
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:15,384
WORD AUSTRALIA IN MY TWITTER

113
00:03:15,384 --> 00:03:16,385
FEED BECAUSE I COULDN'T STAND TO

114
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:17,186
LISTEN TO IT.

115
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:18,387
WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONFISCATE

116
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:20,222
ALL THE GUNS IN AMERICA.

117
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:22,558
IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAVE BEEN.

118
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:23,292
WE HAVE A SECOND AMENDMENT IN

119
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:25,194
THE CONSTITUTION THAT SAYS WE

120
00:03:25,194 --> 00:03:27,196
HAVE THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT FROM

121
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:28,897
GOD TO DEFEND OURSELVES WHICH

122
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:29,498
THE SUPREME COURT HAS

123
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:31,600
INTERPRETED, AS YOU KNOW BETTER

124
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,636
THAN I DO, THE SUPREME COURT

125
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:35,771
DECISION IN HELLER WHO I SAW

126
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:36,505
TONIGHT IN DALLAS.

127
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:37,539
THE INDIVIDUAL HAS THE RIGHT TO

128
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:41,210
OWN A GUN AND KEEP IT AT HOME.

129
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,011
>> Shannon: PART OF WHAT HE

130
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:43,345
HAD TO SAY IS THAT THEY HAVE

131
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:48,450
BEEN TOO NICE WHEN IT COMES TO

132
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,018
THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

133
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:50,819
HE BELIEVES IT'S TIME TO CONTROL

134
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,356
GUNS MORE.

135
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:55,357
WE KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT'S

136
00:03:55,357 --> 00:00:00,000
HAPPENING WHERE YOU ARE IN
