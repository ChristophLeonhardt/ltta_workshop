for a number of decades now members of Congress have had access to a little-known clinic and pharmacy very close to the House of Representatives that's run through a membership program through this clinic they can gain easy access to drugs very close to the place to work without for the most part having to deal with regular people or have it be clear that you know they're going for those drugs and things like that now this by itself is not necessarily all that important or all that interesting but recently the pharmacist at that little pharmacy has come out and talked a little bit about some of the prescriptions that he's been giving without being too specific so we want to give you information about the clinic and also the consequences legislatively coming out of the clinic now it's the deliveries of these drugs that come for the basically private use of the representatives go to the office of the attending physician and Navy doctors perform like basic triage of medical emergencies like you want to have it very close in cases a problem they had a period decades and decades ago where several representatives died in a short period of time so it makes sense at that point that they had it makes a little bit less sense now when there's a CVS on every corner knows in 1928 exactly now at its busiest it sends as many as 100 prescriptions to members in a day which is not exclusively to representatives but it's mostly to them and that's a lot now there are many prescriptions that a person can get the average American diet is horrendous and so it's our natural destiny that we will end up on various forms of drugs at some point in our life but there are ones that make you stop and make you think just a little bit so this is a Mike Kim the pharmacist talking about his experience and says at first it's cool and then you realize I'm filling some drugs that are for some pretty serious health problems as well and they they're these are the people that are running the country he listed treatments or conditions like diabetes which is fine and Alzheimer's which seems a little bit more consequential and he goes on to say it makes you kind of sit back and say wow they're making the highest laws of the land and they may not even remember what happened yesterday Mike Kim is definitely gonna get in trouble yes Mike Kim is screwed not like he didn't reveal exactly who it went to maybe he hasn't broken the law I would I would take a vacation if I were you yeah I know I'm not concerned that he broke the law but you know look and he didn't say Republican or Democrat in fact exactly yeah the one example he gave was a and not unrelated to any Alzheimer's or diabetes or anything he just give the example of John Kerry who's a Democrat he said he he came in the day after he lost the election and he's like isn't that amazing that guy could have been the president the United States he was surrounded by every service the next day's a schlep waiting for her you know waiting in line for his drugs the pharmacy which that's who I actually love that about America yeah I wish we had that happen more but so it's not political in that sense but nor do I think it's a violation of law I just feel bad for him because I feel like lawmakers gonna be like you let people know that half of us are getting prescription for Alzheimer's and we don't know what the hell we're doing that could be trouble yeah yeah I noticed so this was a I think I Severin I saw it on a roster I believe and the comments were almost universally apparently conservative saying haha the Dems on drugs brought Schumer it's probably Pelosi like that's what you're scared of the people who have absolutely no power or ability to enact laws that's what you're worried about the day of Alzheimer's how other people are actually passing the bills how about the like I'm not even gonna name names but let's think back to some political events of this year were there any perhaps Republicans who had weird difficulties expressing themselves and remembering things I'm not saying anything I'm just saying and now you hear Alzheimer's and like I like my grandfather actually is pretty deep in Alzheimer's at this point it's a very it's a very debilitating in a very sad condition that affects a lot of Americans but we don't know that they're at the deep end of Alzheimer's maybe they're just at the very beginning and so I looked up the early stages of Alzheimer's and here are some of the effects that it has problems coming up with the right word or name fine you have a little bit trouble speaking that's not a big deal trouble remembering names challenges performing tasks in social or work settings for getting material that one has read losing or miss placing objects increasing trouble with planning or organizing those are things that it does not take a big leap of logic to figure out how that could affect a person it's working a legislative setting or working in many meetings or any of that now has really fast as JR pointed out it today is a production meeting the only thing saving us here is that none of these representatives or senators actually make up their own mind they just vote the way their donors tell them to so perhaps the Alzheimer's doesn't really matter at the end of the day but it is still worrisome yeah well that's right partly where I was going with this first of all to be fair the pharmacy also services staffers lobbyists and family members so not everybody getting the Alzheimer's medication is in Congress but very likely some are and staffers are younger and so this does go to to actual problems one is that the people in Congress are uniformly incredibly old on average I mean Dianne Feinstein just said she's running for re-election she's 84 by the nd 4 yes by the end of her term she would be 90 or 91 okay so and and the reason is once you have money and power and you've got a good donor base and good name recognition you just hang on for dear life and they stay there and they're ancient and I and then in my opinion the corruption sets in and it calcifies so that's the bigger problem guys don't worry about that they don't remember the bill they never read the bill in the first place so remember that talking pointed well Hong has had about the Democrats oh you didn't read the Obamacare did you later they wanted to say they bragged how they didn't read their own legislation that was only 13 pages yeah they never read it there's a lot of things they have to do they're not reading or voting on bills oh well no no there's only one thing they read the email from the donor which tells them which way to vote okay so the Alzheimer's unfortunately is the least of our problems in this corrupt system watch
