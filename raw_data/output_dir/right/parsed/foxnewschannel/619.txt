CHAIN'S 81st BIRTHDAY.
I WILL GO UPSTAIRS AND WATCH
POLLSTERS AND THOSE IN THE
MEDIA FAILED TO PREDICT
DONALD TRUMP'S 2016 ELECTION
WIN.
NOW A "NEW YORK TIMES" OP-ED
IS LOOKING ALL THE WAY TO
THE DAY AFTER ELECTION IN
2020.
AND PREDICTING ANOTHER TRUMP
VICTORY.
PAPER'S COVERAGE OF THE
ELECTION WRITING, QUOTE:
WITH NEITHER A RECESSION NOR
A MAJOR WAR TO RUN AGAINST
DEMOCRATS SOUGHT INSTEAD TO
CAST THE ELECTION IN STARKLY
MORAL TERMS YET BY ELECTION
DAY, THE CHARGE THAT
MR. TRUMP IS MORALLY OR
INTELLECTUALLY UNFIT FOR
OFFICE HAD BEEN MADE SO
SWING VOTERS.
SO, WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD
JOINING US RIGHT NOW IS
FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR OF TURNING POINT
U.S.A. MR. CHARLIE KIRK.
STEVE: WHAT IS GOING ON IN
THE PAGES OF THE "NEW YORK
TIMES."
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
STEVE: SAYING TRUMP WINS.
>> I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THE
"NEW YORK TIMES" HERE.
THE TRAJECTORY BOTH PARTIES
ARE ON.
REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS
RIGHTFULLY BECOME THE PARTY
AMERICA, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
AND JOBS.
AND YOU LOOK AT THE DEMOCRAT
PARTY THEY ARE BECOMING THE
RADICAL SOCIALIST IDEAS THAT
WE CAN POSSIBLY EMBRACE.
BRET HITS THE NAIL ON THE
HEAD HERE.
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME
PEOPLE WILL DISMISS A LOT OF
THIS NONSENSICAL MEDIA
DONALD TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT
AND THINGS ARE IMPROVING.
STEVE: JUST LIKE ONCE UPON A
TIME IT WAS IT'S THE
ECONOMY, STUPID.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MESSAGE
THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO
DOLLARS IN EVERYBODY'S
WANT TO KEEP THOSE COUPLE
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE
COFFERS AT THE U.S. FEDERAL
TREASURY.
>> SO THE DEMOCRATS' MESSAGE
IS LET'S MAKE GOVERNMENT
BIGGER AND TAKE MORE OF YOUR
WAY THE DIRECTION THIS
COUNTRY IS HEADING.
IT'S EVER BEEN.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS RESTORED
THE IDEA OF AMERICA.
IT'S THE RESTORATION OF THE
AMERICAN SPIRIT.
AND SO, YOU HAVE SEEN THE
DEMOCRATS HAVE SUCH
PATHOLOGICAL OPPOSITION TO
DONALD TRUMP THEY ARE
OPPOSING THE IDEA OF AMERICA
IS WELL WHICH IS LOSING
MIDDLE AMERICA.
STEVE: ONE OF THE THINGS THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA DIDN'T SEEM
TO GET AND YOU KNOW, IT'S
TAKEN THEM A LITTLE WHILE TO
LATCH ON TO IS IS HE A
DISRUPTER.
IS HE WORKING THINGS THE WAY
NOBLE HAS EVER WORKED THEM
BEFORE.
AND IT'S DRIVING THEM NUTS.
IS HE
>> HE IS BREAKING ALL THE
CONVENTIONAL RULES.
WOULD YOU EVER SEE A
PRESIDENT GO TO STATE LIKE
NORTHERN
MIRTHERN
MINNHERN
MINNESRN
MINNESOTA.
STEVE: DOESN'T MATTER.
>> HE HAS TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE SHOW UP FOR HIM.
WE DOING THE TRADITIONAL
HE COMES FROM A BUSINESS
MIND SET.
HE COMES FROM A BUSINESS
BACKGROUND AND THESE D.C.
LOBBYISTS, I
LOBBYISTS, BEEN THERE 30, 40
YEARS NOT SURE HOW TO HANDLE
THEM THAT'S WHY HE WILL
CONVINCINGLY WIN
RE-ELECTION.
STEVE: INTERESTING
PREDICTION IN THE OP-ED WHO
THEY PREDICTED HIS OPPONENT
WOULD BE.
AND IT IT WAS ELIZABETH
WARREN.
>> INTERESTINGLY, I CAN
AGREE.
CAN I SEE THAT'S THE
DIRECTIONS THE DEMOCRAT
PARTY IS GOING.
THEY CONSIDER ELIZABETH
WARREN TO BE A MODERATE PICK
NOW BETWEEN THE MORE VERY,
VERY FAR LEFT WING BERNIE
SANDERS AND THE MORE KIND OF
MODERATE DEMOCRATS.
THEY THINK THAT ELIZABETH
WARREN IS A MORE MODERATED
WAY TO BRING THE PARTY
TOGETHER.
AND I THINK BRET'S
PREDICTION WOULD BE ACCURATE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BECOME
"NEW YORK TIMES" GOT
SOMETHING RIGHT WITH THIS
THIS WILL IS A LOT OF WORK
LEFT TO DO.
WE STILL HAVE THE MID TERMS
AHEAD OF US AND THE
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO
CONTINUE TO WIN.
IN A COUPLE YEARS FROM NOW
WHY WILL BE ABLE TOLY LIST
OFF MORE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
THAN TODAY.
PRESIDENT IS ABOUT RESULTS.
AMERICA IS A MUCH BETTER
PLACE TODAY THAN IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN IF HILLARY CLINTON
