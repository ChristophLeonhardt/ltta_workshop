I heard about the Pulu earthquake here in Makassar around the Maghrib praying time and my wife told guna wons grandmother directly about what happened in Poland his grandmother was worried about his condition and called him all of the family here tried to call a gong many times a gong has two mobile phone numbers and they both couldn't be reached convicted uh we didn't give up trying to call him and then called his father his father is a very calm person and said that a gong might still be on duty so that could be why his mobile phone is off maybe after he finishes a gun will call back so we tried to call a gong all night but couldn't contact him and at that time I called his mother she said that a gong had died because he jumped from the air traffic control tower she cannot speak anymore she's only crying loudly his mother never thought that one of the victims would be one of our family Antonius gonna wanna go you you
