00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,435
LIKE THERE'S A DEBATE ABOUT IT. 

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:03,603
THE DEBATE IS OVER.

RSPECT. 

14
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,351
THE FAMILIES OF THESE SOLDIERS 

15
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,719
HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MORE THAN 

16
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,921
60 YEARS FOR THEIR LOVED ONES 

17
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,690
TO COME HOME. 

18
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,192
WE HOPE THAT AS REMAINS ARE

ALL OF THE ALARMING IMAGES OF 

52
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,614
THE WILDFIRES CAUSING SEVERE 

53

54
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,385
THE WHITE HOUSE AND FEMA HAVE

00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:36,396
WILDFIRES. 

63
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,464
AS A RESULT FEMA HAS PLACED 

64
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:41,067
RESOURCES FROM EIGHT DIFFERENT 

65
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,135
FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS AND 

66
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,304
AGENCIES TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS 

67
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,772

00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,207
THE PRESIDENT WILL CONTINUE TO

00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,808
MONITOR THIS ONGOING EMERGENCY 

71
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,777
AND MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE OF 

72
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,911

OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THE 

76
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,817
FIREFIGHTERS WHO RECENTLY LOST 

77
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,420

80
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,022
LASTLY, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

81
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,925

SITUATION IN TURKEY INVOLVING 

83
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:08,327
PASTOR ANDREW BRUNSON. 

84
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:09,329
WE'VE SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT 

85
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:09,895
PASTOR BRUNSON HAS DONE 

86
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:13,266
ANYTHING WRONG AND WE BELIEVE 

87
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,000
HE IS A VICTIM OF UNFAIR AND 

88
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,636
UNJUST ATTENTION BY THE 

89
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,103
GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY. 

90
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,372
AT THE PRESIDENT'S DIRECTION, 

91
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,874

FOR ANYTHING FURTHER, I WOULD 

105
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,330

PRESIDENT'S OPINION AND IT'S 

130
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,409
RIDICULOUS THAT ALL OF THE

132
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,978
THAT'S GONE ON WITH THE

WANTS TO SEE IT COME TO AN END 

137
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,919
AS HE STATED MANY TIMES. 

138
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,421

THAT NORTH KOREA IS STILL 

146
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,607
DISASSEMBLING ICBMs, IT'S NOT 

147
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:02,875
YET POSSIBLE TO VERIFY THE 

148
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,177
REMAINS HUMAN OR AMERICAN, HOW 

149
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,713
DOES THAT SORT OF MEET THE TEST 

150
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,314
OF NORTH KOREA FULFILLING ITS 

151
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,515
COMMITMENT THAT IT MADE IN 

152
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:09,815

>> I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON 

154
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,085

ON ANY POTENTIAL INTELLIGENCE 

156
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:15,521

157
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,522
IN TERMS OF THE REMAINS, WE

UNTIL THIS POINT. 

165
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:31,337

FIGURE INITIALLY FOR TARIFFS 

169

THAT UP TO 25%. 

173
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,016
WHAT'S THE REASON BEHIND 

174
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:47,120
INCREASING IT FROM 10% TO 25%, 

175
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,022

00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:07,607
THROUGH THE DETAILS OF THAT 

188
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,709
UPDATE IN REGARDS TO THE 

189
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,610
QUESTION YOU ASKED ABOUT 10 TO 

190
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:10,776
25. 

191
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:12,712
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE 

192
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,714
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO CONTINUE 

193
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,116
TO HOLD CHINA RESPONSIBLE FOR 

194
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:17,749
THEIR UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES. 

195
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:18,718
THIS HAS GONE ON FOR LONG 

196
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:22,221
ENOUGH AND HE'S GOING TO DO 

197
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:22,654
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 

198
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:23,889
>>REPORTER:  DOES THE PRESIDENT 

199
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:24,190
BELIEVE -- 

200
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,523
>> GO AHEAD. 

201
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:25,825
>>REPORTER:  I WAS JUST GOING 

202
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,127
TO SAY, THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE 

203
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,264
SOME HEADWAY WITH THE E.U. 

204
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,331
IN TERMS OF LOWERING TRADE 

205
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,866
BARRIERS, TAKING STEPS TOWARD 

206
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:34,600
LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. 

207
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,204
DOES THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM 

208
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,140
BELIEVE THAT THAT IS POSSIBLE 

209
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,677
WITH CHINA WITHOUT TAKING SOME 

210
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,477
REAL PUNITIVE MEASURES? 

211
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:48,214
>> CERTAINLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE 

212
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,115
THE PLAYING FIELD LEVELED. 

213
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,983
THE PRESIDENT, AS BOTH HE AND I 

214
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,718
THINK ABOUT 15 MEMBERS OF HIS 

215
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:53,819
ADMINISTRATION HAVE SAID 

216
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:56,022
REPEATEDLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE 

217
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,622
UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES STOP. 

218
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,824
BUT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS, THE 

219
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,925
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HOLD 

220
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,026
THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE. 

221
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,194
HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUT 

222
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,929
PRESSURE ON CHINA AND HE'S NOT 

223
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,964
GOING TO SIT BACK AND ALLOW 

224
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,766
AMERICAN INDUSTRIES AND 

225
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,635
AMERICAN WORKERS TO BE TAKEN 

226
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,503
ADVANTAGE OF. 

227
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:10,770
DAVE. 

228
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,773
>>REPORTER:  SARAH, CHURCHES 

229
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:14,573
AROUND THE COUNTRY, SYNAGOGUES, 

230
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:17,109
SOME SCWRALG LEADERS HAVE BEEN 

231
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:18,210
UP IN ARM -- EVANGELICAL 

232
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,613
LEADERS HAVE BEEN UP IN ARMS 

233
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,614
ABOUT LAST YEAR'S TAX CUT LAWS. 

234
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,615
THEY SAY THERE'S A PROVISION IN 

235
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,917
THERE THAT'S GOING TO FORCE 

236
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,752
THEM TO PAY A NEW 21% FEDERAL 

237
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,921
INCOME TAX ON THE BENEFITS THEY 

238
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:29,555
GIVE CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. 

239
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,322
CAN YOU ASSURE CHURCHES FROM 

240
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:31,224
THE PODIUM THERE THAT THEY'RE 

241
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,192
NOT GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A NEW 

242
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,727
TAX? 

243
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,429
>> I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE A 

244
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,029
BLANKET GENERALIZATION ABOUT 

245
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,464
EVERY CHURCH IN AMERICA, BUT 

246
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,299
CERTAINLY THE GOAL OF THE TAX 

247
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,767
CUTS AND REFORMS PACKAGE WAS TO 

248
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,269
PROVIDE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF 

249
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,004
RELIEF TO THE GREATEST NUMBER 

250
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,538
OF AMERICANS, AND WE FEEL THAT 

251
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:47,206
IT'S DONE THAT. 

252
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,508
WE FEEL THAT THE OTHER POLICIES 

253
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,109
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT 

254
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,912
FORWARD WHEN IT COMES TO THE 

255
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,847
ECONOMY HAVE CERTAINLY MOVED 

256
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:55,715
THE BALL FORWARD, MADE OUR 

257
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,616
ECONOMY INFINITILY STRONGER 

258
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,750
THAN IT HAS BEEN IN DECADES, 

259
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,118
AND I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT BY 

260
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,219
ALL OF THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE 

261
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:06,125
COME OUT OVER THE LAST YEAR AND 

262
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:06,358
A HALF.

WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT PREPARED 

267
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,634
TO DO TO MAKE SURE THEY KEEP 

268
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:15,167
THEIR TAX-EXEMPT STATUS? 

269

>> I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING 

270
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,837

AT IMPEDING A CRIMINAL

INVESTIGATION CONSTITUTES 

275
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:24,743
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. 

276
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:25,244
RUDY GIULIANI ISSUED A 

277
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,712
STATEMENT SAYING HE DOESN'T 

278
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,547
THINK THIS MORNING'S TWEET IS 

279
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:30,582
OBSTRUCTION BECAUSE THE 

280
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:31,250
PRESIDENT SAID SESSIONS SHOULD 

281
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,220
STOP THE MUELLER PROBE RATHER 

282
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,922
THAN ORDERING HIM TO HALT IT. 

283
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,623
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS RUDY 

284
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,925

285

TWEETS, AND DOES THAT STATEMENT 

287
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,495
REFLECT THE OPINION OF THE 

288
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:44,664
PRESIDENT'S LEGAL TEAM? 

289
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,766
>> LOOK, THE PRESIDENT IS NOT 

290
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:47,533
OBSTRUCTING, HE'S FIGHTING 

291
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:47,733
BACK. 

292
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,236
THE PRESIDENT IS STATING HIS 

293
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,737
OPINION, HE'S STATING IT 

294
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,005
CLEARLY, AND HE'S CERTAINLY 

295
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:53,672
EXPRESSING THE FRUSTRATION THAT 

296
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:56,208
HE HAS WITH THE LEVEL OF 

297
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,244
CORRUPTION THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM

00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,413
PEOPLE LIKE JAMES COMEY, PETER 

299
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:00,913
STRZOK, ANDREW McCABE. 

300
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,348
THERE'S A REASON THAT THE 

301
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,316
PRESIDENT IS ANGRY, AND, 

302
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,617
FRANKLY, MOST OF AMERICA IS 

303
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,884
ANGRY AS WELL, AND THERE'S NO 

304
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:09,422
REASON HE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO 

305
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,658
VOICE THAT OPINION.

TO AFFECT OPERATIONS IN THE

00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,047

INFORMATION ON TESLA. 

322

BUT WE'D LIKE ALL THEM TO BUILD 

323
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,725
IN AMERICA AND NOT HELP ENGAGE 

324
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,126

338
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,715
REPUBLICAN SENATOR SAID THE

COMPLETE THEIR WORK. 

343
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,991

BY MR. MUELLER OUGHT TO BE 

347
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:23,496
COMPLETED AND NOT SORT OF CUT 

348
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:23,696
OFF? 

349
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,332

BE COMPLETED. 

351
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:28,968
WE'D LIKE IT TO BE COMPLETED

SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

AMOUNT OF TIME. 

355
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,971

CLOSE. 

359
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,111
WE'VE SAID THAT A NUMBER OF

TIMES. 

361
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:43,315

00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,392
MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. 

371
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:54,960
GO AHEAD. 

372
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,829
>> DOES THE PRESIDENT STILL 

373
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,064
BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE VOTING 

374
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:58,664
ILLEGALLY IN THIS COUNTRY. 

375
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,267
IS THAT THE PUSH FOR THE 

376
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:01,767
REQUIRING VOTER ID'S? 

377
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,370
>> EVEN IF THERE ARE 10 PEOPLE 

378
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,537
VOTING ILLEGALLY IT SHOULDN'T 

379
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:05,771
HAPPEN. 

380
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,939
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO SEE THE 

381
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,740
INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS 

382
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,308
SYSTEM UPHELD AND THAT'S THE 

383
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,142
PURPOSE OF HIS COMMENTS. 

384
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,744
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT 

385
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,145
ANYBODY THAT'S VOTING IS 

386
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,246
SOMEBODY THAT SHOULD BE VOTING 

387
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,749
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING 

388
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:17,450
THAT FRANKLY SHOULD BE 

389
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,084
CELEBRATED, NOT DISCRIMINATED. 

390
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:18,317
MAJOR. 

391
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:18,984
>>REPORTER:  WHEN IS THE LAST 

392
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:20,920
TIME THE PRESIDENT WENT TO A 

393
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,287
GROCERY STORE? 

394
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,221
>> I'M NOT SURE. 

395
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:25,725
I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT MATTERS 

396
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,025
EITHER. 

397
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:26,458
MAJOR, GO AHEAD. 

398
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,927
>> HE SAID LAST NIGHT ABOUT THE 

399
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:28,294
GROCERY STORE. 

400
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,129
>> I'VE HE BEEN TO THE GROCERY 

401
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,764
STORE, I'VE NEVER HAD TO SHOW 

402
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,065
AN I.D. 

403
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:33,866
WHEN I GO TO BUY GROCERIES. 

404
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,267
>> CERTAINLY IF YOU GO TO A 

405
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,636
GROCERY STORE AND YOU BUY BEER 

406
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,938
AND WINE, YOU'RE CERTAINLY 

407
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,573
GOING TO SHOW YOUR I.D. 

408
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,606
I DON'T THINK -- 

409
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:42,274
>> THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T DRINK. 

410
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,009
>> HE'S NOT SAYING EVERY TIME 

411
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:44,510
WHEN HE WENT IN. 

412
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,846
HE SAID EVERY TIME WHEN YOU GO 

413
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:47,846
TO THE GROCERY STORE. 

414
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:49,015
I'M PRETTY SURE EVERYBODY 

415
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,750
THAT'S IN HERE THAT'S GONE TO A 

416
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,851
GROCERY STORE AND HAS PURCHASED 

417
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,452
BEER OR WINE HAS HAD TO SHOW 

418
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:53,752
THEIR I.D. 

419
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:54,920
AND IF THEY DIDN'T, THAT'S 

420
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,088
PROBABLY A PROBLEM WITH THE 

421
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:56,555
úGR 

422
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,123
MAJOR, GO AHEAD. 

423
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,624
>>REPORTER:  TO FOLLOW UP ON 

424
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,725
JOHN DECKER'S QUESTION, YOU 

425
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,260
WANT THE INVESTIGATION TO END. 

426
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,429
YOU WANT IT TO END I PRESUME 

427
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,464
ALSO WITHOUT ANY OBSTRUCTION, 

428
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:05,897
MEANING WITHOUT ANY 

429
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:06,231
INTERFERENCE. 

430
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:06,731
MANY HAVE DESCRIBED THE 

431
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:08,367
PRESIDENT'S TWEET THIS MORNING 

432
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,269
AS BLOWING OFF STEAM. 

433
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:10,970
IS THAT A FAIR 

434
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,370
CHARACTERIZATION? 

435
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,037
IT'S JUST AN OPINION HE'S 

436
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:14,740
THROWING OUT THERE, IT HAS 

437
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,542
NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS ACTUAL 

438
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,576
GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF OR 

439
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,711
SUPERVISION OF THIS 

440
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,078
INVESTIGATION. 

441
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,046
>> ONCE AGAIN, AS I SAID 

442
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,615
EARLIER, THE PRESIDENT IS 

443
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,717
STATING HIS OPINION. 

444
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,417
IT'S NOT AN ORDER, BUT HE'S 

445
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,819
BEEN I THINK CRYSTAL CLEAR 

446
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,322
ABOUT HOW HE FEELS ABOUT THIS 

447
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:30,822
INVESTIGATION FROM THE 

448
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:31,122
BEGINNING. 

449
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:31,356
SARAH. 

450
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:32,525
>>REPORTER:  YOU JUST SAID A 

451
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,527
MOMENT AGO THAT THE 

452
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,027
INVESTIGATION ITSELF IS 

453
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,328
CORRUPT, THE MUELLER 

454
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,631
INVESTIGATION, AND THEN YOU 

455
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,265
MENTIONED COMEY AND McCABE AND 

456
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:39,665
STRZOK. 

457
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,066
STRZOK CERTAINLY -- HE WAS FOR 

458
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:41,667
A TIME -- 

459
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:45,437
>> THE ENTIRE INVESTIGATION IS 

460
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:46,839
BASED OFF OF A DIRTY 

461
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,440
DISCREDITED DOSSIER THAT WAS 

462
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,143
PAID FOR BY AN OPPOSING 

463
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,745
CAMPAIGN AND HAD A LOT OF 

464
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,547
CORRUPTION WITHIN THE ENTITY 

465
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,748
WHICH WAS OVERSEEING IT WHICH 

466
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:57,717
WAS PETER STRZOK, JAMES COMEY, 

467
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,084
ANDREW McCABE. 

468
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,051
WE'VE LAID THIS OUT A NUMBER OF 

469
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,318
TIMES. 

470
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,220
I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE TO 

471
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,722
GO INTO IT EVERY SINGLE TIME 

472
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,924
WE'RE IN HERE. 

473
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,058
>>REPORTER:  IF IT'S CORRUPT, 

474
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,394
WHY DOESN'T THE PRESIDENT JUST 

475
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,361
END IT OR USE HIS POWERS? 

476
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,729
IF HE BELIEVES THAT, WHY 

477
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,131
DOESN'T HE FOLLOW THROUGH ON 

478
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:12,331
THAT? 

479
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,833
>> ONCE AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT 

480
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,633
HAS ALLOWED THIS PROCESS TO 

481
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,869
PLAY OUT, BUT HE THINKS IT'S 

482
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,738
TIME FOR IT TO COME TO AN END. 

483
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,272
SARAH, GO AHEAD. 

484
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:20,973
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 

485
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,107
I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD 

486
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:23,242
CLARIFY THE TWEET FROM THIS 

487
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:23,742
MORNING. 

488
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,776
IS IT THE PRESIDENT'S DESIRE 

489
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:25,945
FOR SESSIONS TO UNRECUSE 

490
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,146
HIMSELF FROM THE PROBE, AND IS 

491
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,081
IT ALSO HIS DESIRE FOR THE 

492
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,482
SPECIAL COUNSEL TO BE FIRED ? 

493
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:32,284
>> I THINK I'VE CLARIFIED THIS 

494
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,251
ABOUT 10 TIMES NOW. 

495
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,986
IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S OPINION. 

496
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:35,721
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FURTHER. 

497
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:35,955
STEVE. 

498
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,424
>> YES, SARAH, LAST NIGHT AT 

499
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,025
THE TAMPA RALLY THE PRESIDENT 

500
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,562
AGAIN PUSHED FOR CREATION OF A 

501
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,830
SPACE FORCE AS A NEW MILITARY 

502
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,064
BRANCH. 

503
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:46,665
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TODAY 

504
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:50,069
MISSED A DEADLINE TO SUBMIT A 

505
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,338
REPORT TO CONGRESS ABOUT HOW 

506
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,004
THIS SPACE FORCE IS TO BE 

507
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:54,607
STRUCTURED, AND WE'RE TOLD NOW 

508
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,142
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TWICE 

509
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:58,944
REJECTED DRAFTS BECAUSE THE 

510
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,845
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T WANT 

511
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,247
A SPACE FORCE, IT WOULD RATHER 

512
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,649
CREATE A SPACE COMMAND UNDER 

513
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,249
THE EXISTING MILITARY 

514
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:04,549
STRUCTURE. 

515
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,518
IN VIEW OF THIS, HOW IS THE 

516
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:08,020
PRESIDENT GOING TO FORCE THE 

517
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,254
CREATION OF A SPACE FORCE? 

518
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:10,322
>> WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK 

519
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,957
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 

520
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,460
TO FIGURE OUT AND DETERMINE THE 

521
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,728
BEST WAY FORWARD, SOMETHING THE 

522
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,395
PRESIDENT FEELS STRONGLY ABOUT, 

523
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,697
AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH 

524
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,300
OUR TEAM THERE AND FIGURE OUT 

525
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,834
THE BEST SOLUTION. 

526
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,069
>>REPORTER:  I HAVE A QUESTION 

527
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,338
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT IS MEETING 

528
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,205
WITH INNER CITY PASTORS. 

529
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:27,873
TODAY SECRETARY CARSON HAD 

530
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,341
PUSHED POLICIES THAT WOULD 

531
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,844
RAISE THE RENT ON MANY POOR 

532
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:32,344
PEOPLE. 

533
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,646
HE'S ALSO PUSHED POLICIES OF A 

534
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,146
SLOW ANTI-IMMIGRATION 

535
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:34,446
INITIATIVE. 

536
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,482
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT GOING TO 

537
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,349
SAY TO THESE INNER CITY PASTORS 

538
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,751
WHOSE AREAS MIGHT BE HURT BY 

539
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:40,251
SOME OF THESE POLICIES? 

540
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,420
>> CERTAINLY THAT'S A REASON TO 

541
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,721
SIT DOWN WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS 

542
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,556
TO HEAR THEIR FEEDBACK, HEAR 

543
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:44,923
THEIR CONCERNS. 

544
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,725
I KNOW THE PRIMARY POINT OF 

545
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,494
DISCUSSION FOR TODAY IS TO 

546
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,728
DISCUSS PRISON REFORM, BUT I 

547
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:50,629
WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY 

548
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,797
RAISED THOSE ISSUES AND THAT'S 

549
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,399
WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS INVITED 

550
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,100
THEM HERE SO THAT HE CAN HAVE 

551
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,334
THOSE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AND 

552
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:59,705

DOES THIS PRESIDENT FEEL THAT 

574
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,639
THIS COUNTRY ADMITS TOO MANY 

575
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,340
REFUGEES? 

576
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,541
WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR 

577
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:35,941
SCALING IT BACK? 

578
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,476
>> IT'S PART OF AN ONGOING 

579
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,877
DISCUSSION AND NO POLICY 

580
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:39,411
DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE.

593
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:55,794
TO AMERICANS. 

594
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:56,828
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. 

595
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:59,365
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 

596
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,200

597
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,768
THE ABILITY TO VET ANY

PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE CONCERNS 

607

WITH THAT. 

608
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:16,615
AGAIN, THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY 

609
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,450
IS NATIONAL SECURITY AND MAKING

OF OUR TV COLLEAGUES LAST NIGHT 

738
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,380
THAT IT IS WRONG FOR HIS MOST 

739
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,748
VOCAL SUPPORTERS TO BE MENACING 

740
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:37,449
TOWARDS JOURNALISTS DOING THEIR 

741
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,451
JOBS IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT 

742
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,152
OR IN ANY SITUATION? 

743
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,588
>> ON THE FIRST PART, THE 

744
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,189
PRESIDENT CONDEMNS AND 

745
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:48,660
DENOUNCES ANY GROUP THAT WOULD 

746
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,327
INCITE VIOLENCE AGAINST ANOTHER 

747
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:50,061
INDIVIDUAL AND CERTAINLY 

748
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:51,797
DOESN'T SUPPORT GROUPS THAT 

749
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,432
WOULD PROMOTE THAT TYPE OF 

750
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:53,699
BEHAVIOR. 

751
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,400
WE'VE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THAT A 

752
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,703
NUMBER OF TIMES SINCE THE 

753
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,371
BEGINNING OF THE 

754
00:18:59,371 --> 00:18:59,738
ADMINISTRATION. 

755
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,273
ON THE SECOND PART OF YOUR 

756
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,276
QUESTION, THE PRESIDENT, AS I 

757
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,212
JUST SAID, DOES NOT SUPPORT 

758
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,680
VIOLENCE AGAINST ANYONE OR 

759
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,748
ANYTHING, AND WE'VE BEEN VERY 

760
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:09,981
CLEAR. 

761
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:11,149
EVERY SINGLE TIME WE'VE BEEN 

762
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:11,883
úA 

763
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:14,720
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MEDIA, THE 

764
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,090
PRESIDENT DOES THINK THAT THE 

765
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,558
MEDIA HOLDS A RESPONSIBILITY. 

766
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,792
WE FULLY SUPPORT A FREE PRESS, 

767
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,762
BUT THERE ALSO COMES A HIGH 

768
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,897
LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY WITH 

769
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:26,097
THAT. 

770
00:19:26,097 --> 00:19:27,399
THE MEDIA ROUTINELY REPORTS ON 

771
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,233
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND 

772
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,001
GOVERNMENT SECRETS THAT PUT 

773
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:31,970
LIVES IN DANGER AND RISK 

774
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,971
VALUABLE NATIONAL SECURITY 

775
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:33,272
TOOLS. 

776
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,973
THIS HAS HAPPENED BOTH IN OUR 

777
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:35,974
ADMINISTRATION AND IN PAST 

778
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:36,374
ADMINISTRATIONS. 

779
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:39,378
ONE OF THE WORST CASES WAS THE 

780
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,679
REPORTING ON THE U.S. ABILITY 

781
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,214
TO LISTEN TO OSAMA BIN LADEN'S 

782
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:44,282
SATELLITE PHONE IN THE LATE 

783
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:44,482
'90s. 

784
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:46,084
BECAUSE OF THAT REPORTING HE 

785
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:54,726
STOPPED USING THAT PHONE AND 

786
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,394
THE COUNTRY LOST VALUABLE 

787
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:55,727
INTELLIGENCE. 

788
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:56,128
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOW 

789
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,676
>>REPORTER:  TRYING TO GET THE 

790
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,877
BFTER AND YELLING THAT THE 

791
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,878
NETWORK SUCKS IS THAT RIGHT OR 

792
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,278
WRONG? 

793
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,813
>> WHAT WAS THE FIRST PART OF 

794
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:15,380
YOUR QUESTION? 

795
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,682
>>REPORTER:  I SAID NO ONE WAS 

796
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,750
BEING VIOLENT LAST NIGHT IN 

797
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,453
TERMS OF HITTING ANYBODY AND NO 

798
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,154
BROADCASTER WAS BROADCASTING 

799
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:22,521
STATE SECRETS. 

800
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,555
THEY WERE TRYING  TO DO 

801
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,456
STANDUPS AT PUBLIC RALLY AND 

802
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,959
YOU HAD PEOPLE TRYING  TO YELL 

803
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,759
OVER THEM, PREVENTING THEM FROM 

804
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,161
DOING THEIR JOBS AND YELLING 

805
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,729
THAT THEIR NETWORK SUCKS ON 

806
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,229
LIVE TV. 

807
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:32,530
DO YOU SUPPORT THAT OR NOT? 

808
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,865
>> WHILE WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT 

809
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,300
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, WE ALSO 

810
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,737
SUPPORT FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND 

811
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,571
WE THINK THAT THOSE THINGS GO 

812
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:39,838
IN HAND. 

813
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,074
>>REPORTER:  YOU TALKED A 

814
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,342
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TWEETS 

815
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,843
EARLIER, BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

816
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:45,677
ALSO TWEETED ABOUT PAUL 

817
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,179
MANAFORT AND COMPARING HIS 

818
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,747
TREATMENT TO THAT OF ALCAPONE 

819
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:53,919
AND HE SEEMS TO SAY THAT HE 

820
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,319
TREATED UNFAIRLY. 

821
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,455
I GUESS FIRST OF ALL DOES THE 

822
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,556
PRESIDENT FEEL LIKE PAUL 

823
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,457
MANAFORT IS BEING TREATED 

824
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,891
UNFAIRLY AND WHEN HE TALKED 

825
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:00,992
ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF SOLITARY 

826
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:05,197
<font color="#00FF00"><u>ONFINEMENT AND THE FACT THAT </u></font>

827
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,098
MANAFORT HASN'T BEEN CONVICTED 

828
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,799
YET, DOES THIS ADMINISTRATION 

829
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,200
HAVE A LARGER CONCERN ABOUT 

830
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,502
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT BEING USED 

831
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,903
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN 

832
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,639
CONVICTED OUTSIDE OF PAUL 

833
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:13,972
MANAFORT? 

834
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,474
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF A SPECIFIC 

835
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,975
POLICY POSITION THAT THE 

836
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,009
ADMINISTRATION HOLDS ON THAT 

837
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:18,643
FRONT, CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT 

838
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:23,615
HAS BEEN CLEAR HE THINKS PAUL 

839
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:29,854
MANAFORT HAS BEEN TREATED 

840
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:30,121
UNFAIRLY. 

841
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:30,355
STEVE. 

842
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,089
>> I'LL TAKE IT. 

843
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:31,456
TWO QUESTIONS. 

844
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:40,799
CAN YOU CONFIRM IF THE 

845
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,000
PRESIDENT HAS ACCEPTED [ 

846
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,367
INDISCERNABLE ] 

847
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,502
>> I KNOW THAT THE INVITATION 

848
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,769
HAS BEEN EXTENDED, BUT I DON'T 

849
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:47,739
BELIEVE A FINAL DECISION HAS 

850
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,974
BEEN MADE. 

851
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,176
I DO KNOW THAT BOTH SECRETARY 

852
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,345
MATTIS AND SECRETARY POMPEO

854
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,849
BELIEVE IT'S NEXT MONTH AND 

855
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,084
WILL BEGIN THE DIALOGUE AND THE 

856
00:21:59,084 --> 00:21:59,784
PROCESS AND POTENTIAL 

857
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:05,457
DISCUSSION FOR A PRESIDENTIAL 

858
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,725
VISIT LATER IN THE YEAR.

>>REPORTER:  PAKISTAN CONCERNED

HISTORIC ELECTION [

INAUDIBLE  ] 

865
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,085
>> CERTAINLY THE UNITED STATES 

866
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,353
AND INDIA HAVE A DEEP AND 

867
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,188
ABIDING STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP 

868
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,090
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 

869
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,192
BUILD ON THAT PARTNERSHIP AND 

870
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:40,892
ADVANCED COOPERATION AND I 

871
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,094
THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT AT THE 

872
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:46,531
MEETING THAT WILL TAKE PLACE 

873
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,399

NEXT MONTH. 

876
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,334
>> DOES PAUL MANAFORT BELIEVE 

877
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,002
HE IS INNOCENT OF THE CHARGES 

878
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:51,536
HE FACES? 

879
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,905
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE 

880
00:22:53,905 --> 00:23:01,680
PRESIDENT'S ROLE TO PLAY. 

881
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,314
HE BELIEVES HE'S BEING TREATED 

882
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:02,581
UNFAIRLY. 

883
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,884
>> HAS THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT 

884
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,187
DIRECTLY TO JEFF SESSIONS AT 

885
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:09,487
ANY POINT. 

886
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:15,961
>> WE GOT TIME FOR ONE LAST 

887
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:16,228
QUESTION. 

888
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:16,595
LAST QUESTION. 

889
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,762
>> SO THE PRESIDENT'S -- IT'S 

890
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:18,897
THE PRESIDENT'S OPINION THAT 

891
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,131
SESSIONS SHOULD END THE MUELLER 

892
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:21,399
PROBE, BUT IT'S ALSO HIS 

893
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,568
OPINION THAT THE MUELLER PROBE 

894
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,202
SHOULD PLAY ITSELF OUT? 

895
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,371
>> THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT 

896
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:26,938
HE'S WATCHED THIS PROCESS 

897
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,173
FRANKLY PLAY OUT. 

898
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,675
HE'D LIKE TO SEE IT COME TO A 

899
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:31,275
CONCLUSION SINCE IT'S BEEN 

900
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:33,278
GOING ON FOR THE BETTER PART OF 

901
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,379
A YEAR AND A HALF. 

902
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,580
AND THEY'VE FOUND NO COLLUSION 

903
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,083
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AS HE 

904
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:38,916
SAID MANY, MANY TIMES BEFORE. 

905
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,353
THE PRESIDENT HAS GOT AN EVENT 

906
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,988
STARTING HERE IN A COUPLE 

907
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:43,255
MINUTES. 

908
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:43,455
SURE. 

909
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,189
>>REPORTER:  YOU'VE ALSO SAID 

910
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,790
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES HE CAN 

911
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,157
FIRE MUELLER. 

912
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:48,126
SO DOESN'T IT LOOK WEAK ON 

913
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,662
TWITTER FOR HIM TO SAY SESSIONS 

914
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,297
SHOULD END THIS PROBE WHEN IT'S 

915
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:52,998
ROSENSTEIN THAT COULD END THE 

916
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,399
PROBE AND THE PRESIDENT 

917
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,700
BELIEVES HE CAN END THE PROBE? 

918
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,334
>> IT'S NOT WEAK FOR THE 

919
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,504
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

920
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,907
TO STATE HIS OPININ. 

921
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:03,475
THANKS SO MUCH, GUYS. 

922
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,178
>> CATCH PHRASE OF THE DAY AT 

923
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,579
THE WHITE HOUSE, IT'S NOT AN 

924
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,746
ORDER, IT'S HIS OPINION. 

925
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:09,481
A LOT OF QUESTIONS THERE BEING 

926
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,082
ASKED TO SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS 

927
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,150
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET 

928
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,984
EARLIER TODAY CALLING FOR AN 

929
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,687
END TO THE MUELLER PROBE WHICH 

930
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:16,120
IS STILL ONGOING. 

931
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,390
AND ALSO ASKING ABOUT WHETHER 

932
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,460
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT HIS 

933
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,127
FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER PAUL 

934
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:23,628
MANAFORT IS INNOCENT. 

935
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,696
HE SAYS THAT HE BELIEVES SARAH 

936
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:25,496
HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID THAT SHE 

937
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:27,632
BELIEVES IT'S NOT HIS ROLE TO 

938
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,101
WEIGH IN ON THAT BUT THAT HE 

939
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,270
BELIEVES HE IS BEING TREATED 

940
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:32,537
UNFAIRLY. 

941
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,204
WE'RE ALSO WATCHING TARIFFS, 

942
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:35,273
NEW POTENTIAL TARIFFS BEING 

943
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,108
PLACED OR MENTIONED ON CHINA, 

944
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,709
GOING FROM POTENTIALLY 10% TO 

945
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:39,277
25%. 

946
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,079
WE'RE WATCHING THAT AS WELL, 

947
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,380
AND ALSO LOOKING AT FOR TAT, 

948
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,282
WHO EXACTLY WOULD WIN IN A 

949
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,183
TRADE WAR BETWEEN CHINA AND THE 

950
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,384
U.S. BUT THE BIG FOCUS HAS BEEN 

951
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:49,387
ON THIS MUELLER PROBE AND THE 

952
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,488
FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 

953
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,690
ASKED IN FACT TWEETING TODAY 

954
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,024
FOR THE MUELLER PROBE TO COME 

955
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,994
TO AN END AND EXACTLY WHAT THAT 

956
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,896
WOULD ENTAIL AND WHETHER HE 

957
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,531
WOULD USE HIS INFLUENCE, WE ARE 

958
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,164
HEARING FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES 

959
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:02,000
THAT FOLKS CLOSE TO THE 

960
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,234
PRESIDENT ARE SAYING THAT IS 

961
00:25:03,234 --> 00:25:03,934
HIS OPINION AND THAT HE'S NOT 

962
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:05,637
GOING TO IN FACT PUSH FORWARD 

963
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,272
ON THAT AND MAKE THAT IN FACT 

964
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:07,572
AN ORDER. 

965
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,474
WE'RE WAITING TO SEE EXACTLY 

966
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,175
HOW THIS ALL PLAYS DOWN. 

967
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,978
WE'VE GOT OUR MAJOR GARRETT 

968
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:13,311
STANDING BY. 

969
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,679
WE ARE ALSO SEEING, WATCHING 

970
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,481
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE 

971
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,015
AN EVENT SHORTLY WITH SOME 

972
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:19,617
LEADERS AS WELL IN ABOUT 15, 20 

973
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:19,884
MINUTES. 

974
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:21,586
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THAT AS 

975
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,888
SOON AS WE GET THAT OUT FOR 

976
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:24,189
YOU. 

977
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,590
AND EXACTLY WHERE THIS GOES IS 

978
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,991
SOMETHING WE'RE WATCHING WITH 

979
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:27,525
THE MUELLER PROBE. 

980
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,593
THERE WERE SOME FALSE CLAIMS 

981
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,996
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING 

982
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,430
THIS ENTIRE INVESTIGATION IS 

983
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,931
BASED ON A STEELE DOSSIER WHICH 

984
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:34,465
IS ACTUALLY INCORRECT. 

985
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:35,834
WE'RE GOING TO FACT CHECK SOME 

986
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:36,101
OF THIS. 

987
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:36,868
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MAJOR 

988
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,671
GARRETT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 

989
00:25:39,671 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS BREAK.
