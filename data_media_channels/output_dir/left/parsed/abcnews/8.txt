GEORGE.
AGAIN, THE POWER OF THE FEDERAL 
PROSECUTOR IN THAT THERE WERE 18
COUNTS THAT THIS MAN FACED.
HE'S NOW GOING TO HAVE JAIL TIME
ON AT LEAST EIGHT OF THOSE 
COUNTIES. 
>> PIERRE THOMAS TALKS ABOUT THE
POWER OF THE FEDERAL PROSECUTOR,
NOT A COMPLETE GRAND SLAM HOME 
RUN FOR THE PROSECUTORS BUT 
GUILTY ON EIGHT COUNTS, 
SIGNIFICANT BLOW TO PAUL 
MANAFORT AND PRESIDENT TRUMP.
>> Reporter: IT IS A SIGNIFICANT
DEVELOPMENT OBVIOUSLY FOR 
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER.
THIS IS THE FIRST TEST BEFORE A 
JURY OF HIS INVESTIGATION AND IT
IS A PARTIAL SUCCESS ON THOSE 
TAX CRIMES THAT PAUL MANAFORT 
HAS JUST BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF 
AND BANK FRAUD AND THE FAILURE 
TO FILE OWNERSHIP OF A FOREIGN 
BANK ACCOUNT OR FOREIGN ASSET.
BUT THIS IS ALSO THE POWER OF 
THE JURY SYSTEM.
THEY WERE GIVEN A VERY DENSE, 
VERY DIFFICULT DOCUMENT-DRIVEN 
CASE.
THEY SORTED THROUGH IT, CAME TO 
AN AGREEMENT ON THE 
PROSECUTION'S STRONGEST CASE.
I'VE TALKED TO DEFENSE LAWYERS 
WHO DID THINK THAT THOSE CRIMES 
WERE PRETTY STRONG CASES FOR THE
PROSECUTION.
THESE OTHER ONES THOUGH THE JURY
THREW OUT.
SO HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT THIS 
HAS POLITICALLY, IT PROBABLY 
DOES STRENGTHEN SPECIAL COUNSEL 
ROBERT MUELLER'S HAND.
HE DOES HAVE A VICTORY BUT IT 
ALSO SHOWS THAT THE JURY IN THIS
CASE SHUT ALL THAT OUT AND THEY 
WENT METHODICALLY THROUGH THE 
EVIDENCE.
THEY CAME TO THE AGREEMENTS THEY
COULD AND PUNTED ON THE REST. 
>> OF COURSE PAUL MANAFORT ALSO 
NOW FACES A SECOND TRIAL IN 
WASHINGTON D.C. ON SEVERAL 
CHARGES INCLUDING LYING TO THE 
FBI, CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD THE 
UNITED STATES, WITNESS 
TAMPERING.
SO HE IS FACING EVEN MORE LEGAL 
TROUBLE GOING FORWARD.
I WANT TO BRING IN CRHRIS 
CHRISTIE WHO WORKED WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS AN OUTSIDE 
ADVISER AFTER PAUL MANAFORT WAS 
CHAIRMAN.
CHRIS CHRISTIE, NONE OF THESE 
CHARGES HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
HIS CAMPAIGN WORK FOR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, PAUL MANAFORT'S CAMPAIGN 
WORK FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS RECENTLY AS 
FRIDAY CALLED OUT THIS 
INVESTIGATION, CALLED OUT THIS 
TRIAL AND CALLED PAUL MANAFORT A
GOOD MAN.
>> YEAH, LISTEN, GEORGE, ONE, 
THIS PART NEVER INVOLVES THE 
CAMPAIGN BUT THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THIS IS A MIXED BAG FOR THIS 
SPECIAL COUNSEL.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTS, AT 
LEAST AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, THE 
GUILTY VERDICT HAD VERY LITTLE 
TO DO WITH GATES.
THE ONES THAT THE JURY HUNG ON 
WERE MUCH MORE DEPENDENT ON 
GATES' TESTIMONY. 
>> GATES WAS THE FORMER DEPUTY 
CAMPAIGN CHAIR, WORKED -- 
LONG-TIME COLLEAGUE OF PAUL 
MANAFORT WHO WAS ORIGINALLY 
CHARGED WITH PAUL MANAFORT BUT 
THEN TOOK A PLEA AND WAS THE 
COOPERATING WITNESS AGAINST HIM.
>> HE WAS THE MAIN VERBAL 
WITNESS, NONDOCUMENT WITNESS.
NOW, THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR 
THE NEXT TRIAL BECAUSE THE NEXT 
TRIAL I THINK WILL BE MUCH MORE 
DEPENDENT UPON RICK GATES THAN 
EVEN THE FIRST TRIAL WAS, 
GEORGE.
SO I THINK IF YOU'RE IN THE 
MUELLER TEAM YOU'RE HAPPY 
BECAUSE THIS IS A WIN.
THIS IS A WIN AND IT JUSTIFIES 
YOUR PROSECUTION BUT I THINK -- 
>> THAT MAY BE TRUE, CHRIS, BUT 
LET ME INTERRUPT YOU RIGHT 
THERE.
MUELLER'S TEAM IS SAYING THEY 
HAVE FAR MORE DOCUMENTS FOR THE 
SECOND TRIAL THAN THEY HAD FOR 
THE FIRST TRIAL. 
>> THEY MAY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE SECOND 
TRIAL TO TELL REALLY THAT TO A 
JURY THEY'RE GOING TO NEED GATES
TO BE A NARRATER TO NARRATE THEM
THROUGH THAT IN ADDITION TO THE 
FBI AGENTS.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A TIME 
WHERE MUELLER IS GOING TO LOOK 
BACK ON HOW THEY TRIED THIS 
CASE, HOW WELL THEY PREPARED 
GATES AND WHAT KIND OF WITNESS 
GATES IS. 
>> WE'RE SEEING RICK GATES THERE
BEHIND PAUL MANAFORT ON THE 
SCREEN.
HE'S THE MAN IN THE CIRCLE RIGHT
THERE.
ANOTHER QUESTION ON THIS, CHRIS 
CHRISTIE, ONE OF THE BIG 
QUESTIONS IS WAS THIS ALL AN 
ATTEMPT TO PRESSURE PAUL 
MANAFORT TO GIVE INFORMATION ON 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
HE'S WITHSTOOD THAT SO FAR.
DOES THIS GIVE ANOTHER OPENING 
TO PROSECUTORS, OR IS THAT JUST 
GONE?
>> LISTEN, THERE'S ALWAYS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT WHEN YOU'VE
GOT A SECOND TRIAL THAT YOU'RE 
GETTING READY FOR AND MORE 
CHARGES FOR THEM TO FACE AND NOW
HE HAS THE CERTAINTY OF FACING 
SOME JAIL TIME.
SO NOW IT'S ALL IN AN EVEN MORE 
COMPLETE CONTEXT FOR MANAFORT, 
BUT I WOULD TELL YOU, GEORGE, I 
THINK IF HE HASN'T COOPERATED AT
THIS POINT HE'S PROBABLY NOT 
GOING TO.
THAT COULD MEAN ONE OF TWO 
THINGS, EITHER HE DOESN'T CARE 
TO COOPERATE OR HE'S GOT NOTHING
TO COOPERATE WITH. 
>> PIERRE THOMAS, JUSTICE 
CORRESPONDENT, BEFORE WE GO, A 
MISTRIAL ON TEN COUNTS.
PROSECUTORS WILL NOW ALSO FACE 
THE CHOICE OF WHETHER TO TRY TO 
RETRY ON THOSE CHARGES.
>> GEORGE I THINK ONE OF THE 
THINGS WE HAVE TO FACTOR IN IS A
ASIDE FROM THIS.
PAUL MANAFORT WITH HIS EIGHT 
CONVICTIONS HE'S FACING YEARS IN
JAIL.
YEARS IN JAIL.
THAT IS THE SITUATION FOR HIM.
HE WON'T BE OUT IN THE PUBLIC 
ANY TIME SOON AND HE'S GOT TRIAL
AHEAD BUT HE'S NOW LOOKING AT 
CONVICTIONS THAT WOULD LAND HIM 
IN JAIL FOR YEARS. 
>> AND CELIA VEGA AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE.
THE PRESIDENT CALLED PAUL 
MANAFORT A GOOD MAN ON FRIDAY AS
HE WAS SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THE 
MUELLER INVESTIGATION BUT THE 
WHITE HOUSE HAS HAD CONFLICTS 
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT PAUL 
MANAFORT.
AT FIRST TRIED TO PUSH HIM OFF 
AS SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A LOT
TO DO WITH THE CAMPAIGN EVEN 
THOUGH HE WAS THE CHAIR. 
>> A SMALL PLAYER.
RIGHT AND HE ROSE TO THE RANK OF
MANAGER AND COORDINATED THE ARE 
RUBL NATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE
TEAM.
HE WAS NOT A TWO BIT PLAYER.
AND AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING THE 
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION, TRUMP 
HIMSELF WAS NOT A PART OF THIS 
TRIAL BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT 
THIS.
INDIRECTLY THIS WHITE HOUSE IS 
VERY MUCH LINKED TO PAUL 
MANAFORT AND THIS TRIAL TAKING 
PLACE RIGHT NOW.
SURPRISINGLY WE HAVE NOT HEARD A
COMMENT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP OR 
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
YET TO HEAR A COMMENT FROM 
ANYONE AFFILIATED WITH THE 
CAMPAIGN.
WE WERE GOING TO ASK QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THIS, ABOUT THE MICHAEL 
COHEN DEAL.
THEY CANCELED HIS SPEECH ON THE 
WHITE HOUSE TODAY.
THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THE 
PRESIDENT QUESTIONS TODAY.
THEY SAY IT IS BAD WEATHER.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE 
BEHIND ME THE SKIES ARE PRETTY 
SUNNY AT THIS POINT.
NO COMMENTS JUST YET. 
>> HIS FORMER CAMPAIGN CHAIR 
PAUL MANAFORT FOUND GUILTY ON 
EIGHT ACCOUNTS OF THE TAX 
EVASION.
FAILING TO FIRE FOREIGN BANK 
ACCOUNTS.
BANK FRAUD AND BANK CONSPIRACY.
MISTRIAL ON 10 OTHER COUNTS.
OPEN QUESTION WHETHER 
PROSECUTORS ARE GOING TO 
CONTINUE TO PURSUE THAT.
PAUL MANAFORT FACES A HOST OF 
OTHER CHARGES AS WELL AND COMES 
ON A DAY THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER 
ATTORNEY MICHAEL COHEN HAS PLED 
GUILTY TO CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
CHARGES DEALING WITH THE 2016 
CAMPAIGN AND TAX EVASION AND 
BANK FRAUD.
AND EXPECTING TO HEAR FROM THE 
ASSISTANT ATTORNEY PROSECUTING 
THE CASE.
AND WE'LL BACK ON AIR TONIGHT 
AND FULL REPORT TONIGHT ON WORLD
NEWS TONIGHT.
>>> THAT'S THE HEADLINE OUT OF 
THIS PROCEEDING THAT HE DID THIS
QUOTE AT THE DIRECTION OF THE 
CANDIDATE.
THIS IS BOTH KAREN McDOUGAL AND 
STORMY DANIELS WITH AND AT THE 
DIRECTION OF THE SAME CANDIDATE,
OF COURSE TALKING ABOUT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
A WILD SCENE OUTSIDE OF COURT 
JUST NOW.
MICHAEL COHEN JUST LEFT AS 
PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING AT HIM AT 
THE UP THE OF THEIR LUNGS, "LOCK
HIM UP" CURSING AT HIM.
MICHAEL COHEN CAME IN THROUGH A 
SIDE ENTRANCE.
HE WAS PROTECTED IF YOU WILL BY 
THE POLICE AND FBI AS HE CAME 
IN.
GOT INSIDE.
HE WAS WEARING A DARK SUIT.
A YELLOW TIE.
HE WINKED AT ONE REPORTER.
HE WAS ASKED AT ONE POINT SINCE 
HE WAS PLEADING GUILTY IF HE WAS
UNDER ANY MEDICATION.
BY ANY CHANCE IF HE WAS 
INTOXICATED.
HE SAID ONLY HE HAD A DRINK LAST
NIGHT.
BUT IT GIVES YOU A SENSE WHAT 
WAS GOING THROUGH HIS HEAD.
FOUR TAYS FROM HIS 52th BIRTHDAY
SO A ROUGH WEEK FOR HIM 
DEFINITELY.
AND THE MAX HE COULD FACE WOULD 
BE 65 YEARS.
THAT IS A MAXIMUM PRISON TIME.
SENTENCING IS DECEMBER 12th BUT 
HE DID WALK OUT ON A $500,000 
BOND. 
>> AND NO MENTION OF A 
COOPERATION AGREEMENT INSIDE THE
COURTHOUSE BUT THAT DOESN'T 
PRECLUDE HIS COOPERATION PERHAPS
WITH INVESTIGATORS GOING 
FORWARD.
>> THAT IS ININCREDIBLY 
IMPORTANT POINT.
THERE'S NO COOPERATION.
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO COOPERATE 
WITH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES BUT THE
PLEA DEAL DOESN'T PREVENT THAT 
IN THE FUTURE SO THAT VERY WELL 
COULD HAPPEN. 
>> PLEADING GUILTY.
FACING SOME COUNTS HAVING TO DO 
WITH HIS PERSONAL BUSINESS THERE
BUT DAN THE REAL NEWS HERE.
THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE PLEAS, 
ILLEGAL CORPORATE CONTRIBUTION.
EXCESSIVE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION 
AT THE DIRECTION OF THEED CAN 
FOR PRESIDENT. 
>> RIGHT.
YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE IT OUT 
BECAUSE THE ONES WITH REGARD TO 
TAX FRAUD AND BANK FRAUD THAT IS
RELATED TO HIM PERSONALLY.
THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT ISSUE 
THAN WHEN HE'S SAYING I WAS 
DIRECTED TO DO SOMETHING BY THE 
PERSON THAT IS CLEARLY 
PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP.
SO IN ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENT WE'D
BE SAYING WELL THE NEXT PERSON 
TO BE CHARGED HERE, LIKELY COULD
BE DONALD TRUMP.
BUT BECAUSE AS WE TALKED ABOUT 
MANY TIMES BEFORE IT IS UNLIKELY
THAT THE SPECIAL COUNCIL OR 
ANYONE WILL SEEK TO DIET A 
SIT
INDICT A SITTING PRESIDENT.
BUT REGARDLESS MICHAEL COHEN IS 
MAKING IT VERY CLEAR THAT HE WAS
DIRECTED TO DO THIS BY THE 
PRESIDENT, WHICH ACTUALLY MAKES 
THE PRESIDENT'S CULPABILITY HERE
IF IT IS TRUE MORE SIGNIFICANT 
THAN MICHAEL COHEN WHO IS SIMPLY
SAYING I EXECUTED ON HIS ORDER. 
>> AND I WANT TO BRICK IN CHRIS 
CHRISTIE AS WELL.
ANOTHER FORMER PROSECUTOR.
CHRIS, THE QUESTION WOULD BE 
WHAT KIND OF DOCUMENTS OR OTHER 
EVIDENCE WOULD THE PROSECUTORS 
BE ABLE TO SHOW DO BACK UP THAT 
CONTENTION FROM MICHAEL COHEN?
LET ME GO TO CECELIA VAGUE GAT 
THE WHITE HOUSE.
THESE CLAIMS RUN RIGHT IN THE 
FACE OF PERSISTENT DENIALS WE 
SAW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AIDES OF ANY 
KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING HAVING TO 
WITH THE PAYMENTS TO STORMY 
DANIELS OR KAREN McDOUGAL AT 
LEAST INITIALLY. 
>> EXACTLY AND IS EXPLANATIONS 
HAVE BEEN HEAD SPINNING FROM THE
CAMPAIGN TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO 
THE TRUMP LEGAL TEAM AND REALLY 
WHAT PUT THIS ADMINISTRATION 
FACING SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF A 
CRISIS OF CREDIBILITY, GEORGE.
INITIALLY MICHAEL COHEN SAID 
THIS MONEY CAME FROM HIS 
PERSONAL FUND.
THEN WE ALL REMEMBER THAT SCENE 
ON AIR FORCE ONE WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT DENIED KNOWING 
ANYTHING ABOUT THE PAYMENTS TO 
STORMY DANIELS AND THEN IT JUST 
SPIRALLED OUT OF CONTROL FROM 
THERE, WHERE RUDY GIULIANI, THE 
PRESIDENT'S LAWYER ADMITTED THAT
THE PRESIDENT IN FACT DID USE 
THIS MONEY FROM HIS PERSONAL 
ACCOUNT TO PAY MICHAEL COHEN BUT
HE SAID IT WAS TO STOP FALSE AND
EXTORTIONIST ACCUSATIONS, 
ESSENTIALLY TO SAVE HIS MARRIAGE
NOT BECAUSE HE WAS ADMITTING ANY
WRONG DOING.
THAT WAS THE STORMY DANIELS 
CASE.
AND THE PRESIDENT DID ULTIMATELY
ON TWITTER ACKNOWLEDGE KNOWING 
ABOUT THE PAYMENT THAT THE MONEY
CAME IN FR HIS OWN ACCOUNT TO 
MICHAEL COHEN AND HE SAYS THIS 
WAS HAVING COMMON FOR RICH 
PEOPLE AND CELEBRITIES TO DO.
ON THE KAREN McDOUGAL CASE THERE
HAVE BEEN BLANKET DENIALS FROM 
THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE 
CAMPAIGN WHERE HOPE HICKS HIS 
ALONG TIME AIDE DENIED THE 
PRESIDENT DOING ANYTHING WRONG, 
KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THE 
PAYMENTS AND DENYING BLANKET 
DENIES ABOUT AN AFFAIR.
>>> WE ARE NOW SEEING ROBERT 
GASANI, THE DEPUTY UNITED STATES
ATTORNEY IN NEW YORK. 
>> I'M THE DEPUTY UNITED STATES 
ATTORNEY FOR THE STATE OF NEW 
YORK.
WITH ME IS BILL SWEENEY, 
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF 
THE NEW YORK FIELD OFFICE IN 
FACT FBI AND JAMES RODNA, THE 
SUPERVISORY AGENT FOR THE IRS.
ALSO WITH ME ARE THE PROSECUTOR 
FOR THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS 
OFFICE IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT 
OF NEW YORK WHO PROSECUTED THE 
COHEN MATTER.
I'M GOING TO HAVE A BRIEF 
STATEMENT AND WILL NOT BE TAKING
ANY QUESTIONS.
TODAY AS YOU HEARD MICHAEL COHEN
PLED GUILTY TO 8 FELONY CHARGES.
FIVE OF THOSE DEALT WITH TAX 
EVASION FOR YEARS 2012 THROUGH 
2016.
AND WHICH HE FAILED TO REPORT 
APPROXIMATELY $4.1 MILLION IN 
REPORTED INCOME.
APPROXIMATELY 2.5 OF THAT MONEY 
FROM INTEREST PAYMENTS OF A 
PRINCIPAL LOAN HE FAILED TO 
REPORT.
APPROXIMATELY 1.3 MILLION 
DOLLARS WAS FROM THE OPERATION 
OF HIS TAXI MEDALLION.
APPROXIMATELY 100,000 FROM 
BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS AND OVER 
200,000 DOLLARS WAS FROM 
CONSULTING FEES.
THAT'S OVER 4.3 MILLION DOLLARS 
OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD WHICH 
TRANSLATES INTO A LOSS TO THE 
UNITED STATES TREASURY OF 
APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION.
IN ADDITION IN COUNT 6, MR. 
COHEN PLED GUILTY TO MAKING 
FALSE STATEMENTS TO A FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTION IN CONNECTION FOR AN
APPLICATION FOR A HOME EQUITY 
LINE OF CREDIT.
IN THAT APPLICATION HE FAILED TO
DISCLOSE MORE THAN $14 MILLION 
IN DEBT THAT HE HAD.
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT 
CONCEALMENT HE OBTAINED THAT 
$500,000 LINE OF CREDIT WHICH HE
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENTITLED TO 
HAD HE BEEN CANDID AND HONEST.
IN ADDITION MR. COHEN PLED 
GUILTY TO TWO CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
CHARGES.
ONE FOR CAUSING AN UNLAWFUL 
CORPORATE CONTRIBUTION, AND A 
SECOND ONE FOR PERSONALLY MAKING
AN EXCESSIVE PERSONAL 
CONTRIBUTION, BOTH FOR THE 
PURPOSE OF INFLUENCING THE 2016 
ELECTION.
IN ADDITION WHAT HE DID WAS 
WORKED TO PAY MONEY TO SILENCE 
TWO WOMEN WHO HAD INFORMATION HE
BELIEVED WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO
THE 2016 CAMPAIGN AND TO THE 
CANDIDATE AND THE CAMPAIGN.
IN ADDITION MR. COHEN SOUGHT 
REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT MONEY BY 
SUBMITTING INVOICES TO THE 
CANDIDATE'S COMPANY, WHICH WERE 
UNTRUE AND FALSE.
THEY INDICATED THAT THE 
REIMBURSEMENT WAS FOR SERVICES 
RENDERED FOR THE YEAR 2017, WHEN
IN FACT THOSE INVOICES WERE A 
SHAM.
HE PROVIDED NO LEGAL SERVICES 
FOR THE YEAR 2017.
AND IT WAS SIMPLY A MEANS TO 
OBTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE 
UNLAWFUL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION.
A COUPLE OF POINTS I'D LIKE TO 
MAKE.
FIRST, THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS 
CHARGES AND REFLECT A PATTERN OF
LIES AND DISHONESTY OVER AN 
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.
THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT IN THEIR 
OWN RIGHT.
THEY ARE PARTICULARLY 
SIGNIFICANT WHEN DONE BY A 
LAWYER.
A LAWYER WHO THROUGH TRAINING 
AND TRADITION UNDERSTANDS WHAT 
IT MEANS TO BE A LAWYER TO 
ENGAGE IN HONEST AND FAIR 
DEALING AND ADHERENCE TO THE 
LAW.
MR. COHEN DISREGARDED THAT 
TRAINING.
DISREGARDED THAT TRADITION AND 
DECIDED THAT HE WAS ABOVE THE 
LAW AND FOR THAT HE'S GOING TO 
PAY A VERY VERY SERIOUS PRICE.
WITH RESPECT TO THE CAMPAIGN 
FINANCE VIOLATIONS, THE CAMPAIGN
FINANCE LAWS ARE DESIGNED TO 
PREVENT THE USE OF ILLEGAL MONEY
IN ELECTIONS AND TO MAINTAIN THE
INTEGRITY OF THOSE ELECTIONS.
MR. COHEN MADE GUILTY PLEAS FOR 
THOSE CAMPAIGN VIOLATIONS.
AND THOSE ARE CORE VIOLATIONS.
AND WHAT HE DID WAS REMIND US 
THAT IT IS ILLEGAL FOR 
CORPORATIONS TO MAKE 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO CANDIDATES.
AND IT IS ILLEGAL TO MAKE 
CONTRIBUTIONS IN EXCESS OF THE 
AMOUNT THAT CONGRESS SET FOR 
INDIVIDUALS.
THAT IS A STRONG MESSAGE TODAY.
AND WE WILL NOT BE -- WE WILL 
NOT FEAR OF PROSECUTING 
ADDITIONAL CORPORATION -- 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE CASES.
AND LASTLY AND PERHAPS MOST 
IMPORTANTLY, THIS CASE IS UNIQUE
IN MANY WAYS.
JUST WITNESS THE GATHERING OF 
ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY.
AND IN OTHER WAYS IT IS UNIQUE 
AS WELL.
BUT IN THE REALLY IMPORTANT WAYS
THIS CASE IS NOT UNLIKE MANY 
CASES THAT MY OFFICE T YOUTH 
ATTORNEYS OFFICE BRINGS THAT THE
ENTIRE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
BREAKS AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AGENCIES DO AS WELL INCLUDING 
THE FBI AND THE IRS.
THIS CASE HAS MORE IN COMMON 
WITH ALL THE CASES BECAUSE THEY 
ALL SHARE THE SAME MESSAGE.
AND THAT MESSAGE IS THAT THE 
RULE OF LAW APPLIES.
AND THAT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
ALL OF WHOM ARE GATHERED HERE, 
IT IS OUR COMMITMENT THAT WE 
WHETHER PURSUE AND VINDICATE 
THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO BREAK THE 
LAW AND VINDICATE THE MAJORITY 
OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE LAW-ABIDING 
LIVES, WHO FOLLOW HONEST AND 
FAIR DEALING AND LIVE LIVES OF 
LAWFUL BEHAVIOR.
THE MESSAGE IS THAT WE ARE HERE.
PROSECUTORS ARE HERE.
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS HERE.
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS 
HERE.
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY'S 
HERE.
WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS.
AND THE ESSENCE OF THIS CASE IS 
ABOUT IS JUSTICE AND THAT IS AN 
EQUAL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL 
PERSONS IN THE EYES OF THE LAW.
AND THAT IS A LESSON THAT MR. 
COHEN LEARNED TODAY AND A VERY 
HARSH ONE FOR HIM.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>>> RINGING STATEMENT THERE FROM
ROBERT KASAMI. 
>> SORRY, I WANT TO THANK MR. 
SWEENEY AND JAIMD RODNEY AND THE
AGENTS OF THE IRS.
THE AGENTS WHO WORK WITH THEM.
WE DO MANY CASES WITH THEM AND 
THE DETERMINATION AND THEIR FAIR
DEALING AND VIGOR WITH WHICH 
THEY PURSUE THEIR CASES IS 
REALLY INSPIRATIONAL TO THE 
POPULARS IN PROSECUTORS IN MY 
OFFICE.
I CAN NOT EXPRESS THE GRATITUDE 
FOR THE HARD WORK THEY DID IN 
THIS CASE.
ASSISTING UNITED STATES 
ATTORNEYS AS WELL AS THE DEPUTY 
CHIEF OF THE PUBLIC CORRUPTION 
UNIT AND RUSSELL CAPONE, THE 
CHIEF OF THE PUBLIC CORRUPTION 
UNIT.
FOR ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.
I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT THEIR
MANY VIRTUES AND TALENTS.
BUT THE ONE IMPORTANT THING IS 
THEY ALL ARE SATISFIED WITH 
SIMPLY BEING KNOWN AS PUBLIC 
SERVANT, PROSECUTORS OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS WHO ARE DOING
THEIR JOB.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>>> DEPUTY U.S. ATTORNEY WITH A 
RINGING STATEMENT THERE ABOUT 
THE RULE OF LAW.
I WANT TO BRING IN A MAN WHO 
STOOD IN THOSE SHOES AS WELL.
CHRIS CHRISTIE.
FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY.
HE SAID CHRIS THIS CASE IS 
UNIQUE IN SOME WAYS BUT NOT 
UNLIKELY SO MANY OTHER CASES 
THAT U.S. ATTORNEYS FACE EVERY 
SINGLE DAY AND IT IS SENDING THE
MESSAGE THE RULE OF LAW MUST 
STAND.
AND AS HE SAID A VERY HARSH 
MESSAGE TODAY FOR MICHAEL COHEN.
>> WELL, A REALLY HARSH MESSAGE.
HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW, THE U.S. 
ATTORNEYS OFFICE ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY DOING CASES LIKE THIS 
EVERY DAY.
BUT HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE PREPS
OF THE MEDIA IS THERE BECAUSE 
THIS INVOLVES NOW MICHAEL COHEN 
HAD SAID PUBLICLY HE'S DIRECTED 
TO DO THESE THINGS BY THEN 
CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP NOW 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THIS IS NOW GOING TO COME DOWN 
TO A CREDIBILITY ARGUMENT, 
GEORGE.
AND WHAT THING THEY HAVE TO 
PROVE THAT THE PRESIDENT DID IN 
FACT DIRECT MICHAEL COHEN. 
>> THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU
ABOUT.
WE KNOW THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH 
HUN
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
DOCUMENTS HERE.
MORE THAN A MILLION DOCUMENTS.
WE KNOW THERE IS NO -- THIS IS 
NOT A COOPERATION AGREEMENT.
WE'VE ALSO SEEN THIS BOMB SHELL 
CHARGE FROM MICHAEL COHEN.
AND ADMISSION.
AT THE COURT SAYING HE DID THIS 
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE 
PRESIDENT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT NOW. 
>> LISTEN, ONE WE KNOW THIS IS 
ABNORMAL CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE I 
THINK MOST PEOPLE, LEGAL EXPERTS
COULD WOULD AGREE THE PRESIDENT 
HIMSELF CAN'T BE INDICTED.
ANY CHARGES IN THAT THAT REGARD 
WOULD HAVE TO BE HANDLED BY 
CONGRESS.
I WOULD ALSO SAY NOW WE 
UNDERSTAND PERHAPS WHY MOEB AND 
HIS SPOKESMAN PUTTING OUT THAT 
TAPE OF HE CAN THEN CANDIDATE 
TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THE SETTING 
UP OF SOME TYPE OF MECHANISM TO 
PAY STORMY DANIELS AND NOW THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT TAPE IN 
MICHAEL COHEN'S MIND.
I'LL SURE WE'LL HEAR A DIFFERENT
STORY FROM THE PRESIDENT IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE BUT I THINK THAT 
TAPE NOW BECOMES AND ANY OTHER 
TAPE BECOMES SIGNIFICANT. 
>> AND YOU MENTION THIS AS A 
CREDIBILITY CASE AT THIS POINT.
ISN'T THE PRESIDENT'S CASE HURT 
BY THE FACT THAT PRIOR TO THIS 
HE HAD DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF 
THOSE PAYMENTS AND WAS FORCED TO
ADMIT THAT HE KNEW ABOUT THEM?
>> CERTAINLY, GEORGE, EVERY TIME
HE FOUND TO NOT HAVING TOLD THE 
COMPLETE TRUTH, THE UNVARNISHED 
TRUTH ABOUT SOMETHING.
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT ANY GROUP
OF FOLKS IN THE POSITION OF 
DECIDING THE FACTS OF A CASE, 
YOU KNOW, ARE GOING TO LOOK AT 
AND SAY THAT IS A FACTOR TO BE 
CONSIDERED.
IN THE END THOUGH, I THINK IT IS
VERY INTERESTING THAT MICHAEL 
COHEN IS NOT COOPERATING HERE.
A NON COOPERATING PLEA 
AGREEMENT.
HE LOOKS AT A HUGE SENTENCE HERE
POTENTIALLY.
AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S LOOKING AT 
SOME SIGNIFICANT CRIMES.
MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS 
OF MONETARY AMOUNT, GEORGE ON 
THE STUFF THAT WAS HIS OWN 
PERSONAL CONDUCT THAN WHAT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION, 
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT CAN 
REALLY DRIVE HIS SENTENCE. 
>> THAT IS WHAT WILL DRIVE THE 
SENTENCE.
FINAL QUESTION TO DAN ABRAMS OUR
CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST.
ONE OF THE OPEN QUESTIONS I 
SUPPOSE, IF BOTH YOU AND CHRIS 
CHRISTIE AGREE IT IS UNLIKELY IF
THAT PRESIDENT WOULD BE 
INDICTED, WOULD NOT BE INDICTED.
THE QUESTION IS NOW WOULD THIS 
INFORMATION GO BACK TO ROBERT 
MUELLER.
THE INFORMATION HAVING DO WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
>> NO QUESTION THAT IT WILL.
AND THE QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK
YOURSELF IS IF COHEN ISN'T 
TELLING THE TRUTH, WHY WOULD HE 
MAKE THIS UP?
WHY WOULD HE IMPLICATE HIMSELF 
IN A CRIME THAT IS GOING TO ADD 
YEARS TO HIS SENTENCE?
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
IF THERE IS NO COOPERATION 
AGREEMENT THAT HE'S SORT OF 
GETTING THIS ENORMOUS BENEFIT BY
COMING CLEAN ABOUT, WHAT IS HE 
GETTING FROM THIS?
AND I THINK THAT THAT ADDS TO 
THE CREDIBILITY OF COHEN'S PLEA 
HERE.
AND OF THE TRUTH AS TO WHAT 
HAPPENED.
BECAUSE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE TO BE
A LOGICAL ARGUMENT ON THE OTHER 
SIDE APART FROM WHAT I'M SURE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND RUDY 
GIULIANI WILL SAY IF HE'S JUST 
NOT TELLING THE TRUTH.
HE DID THIS ON HIS OWN.
HE'S TRYING TO BLAME PRESIDENT 
TRUMP FOR IT.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE -- YOU
KNOW, BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT 
IS YOU ADD ANYWAY TO THE PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS THAT HAVE NOW BEEN 
MADE BY GIULIANI AND TRUMP 
CONCEDING THE PAYMENTS.
AND YOU ARE IN A DIFFICULT 
POSITION HERE WITH REGARD TO 
CREDIBILITY. 
>> AND I WANT TO BRING BACK OUR 
SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT.
THIS WAS GIVEN OVER FROM ROBERT 
MUELLER TO THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT
OF NEW YORK.
THEY DID REPORT THIS BACK TO THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BEFORE 
BRIENGING MICHAEL COHEN INTO 
COURT TODAY AND THIS IS 
SOMETHING THEY WERE INFORMED OF.
>> ABSOLUTELY, GEORGE.
MULLER WAS AWARE OF ALL THIS 
GOING ON.
BUT ONE VERY IMPORTANT POINT 
HERE.
THIS CASE IS NOT POTENTIALLY 
OVER.
BECAUSE AS THE CHARGES MENTIONED
THAT COHEN COORDINATED WITH 
OTHER CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS.
THOSE PEOPLE ARE LIKELY GOING TO
GET A CALL FROM THE FBI.
A VISIT FROM THE FBI THAT WILL 
WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY KNOW 
ABOUT THIS.
THEY WILL SEEK ADDITIONAL 
COOPERATION.
SO THIS IS POTENTIALLY FAR FROM 
OVER GEORGE. 
>> THAT IS A CRITICAL POINT.
NOT ONLY THAT HE ACTED AT THE 
DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT BUT 
ALSO HE COORDINATED WITH OTHER 
MEMBERS OF THE CAMPAIGN UNNAMED 
MEMBERS OF THE CAMPAIGN.
FINALLY WANT TO GO TO CECELIA 
VEGA AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM THE 
PRESIDENT BEFORE HE HEADED TO 
CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA AS HE 
WAS LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE.
NO DOUBT HE'LL SPEAK OUT 
TONIGHT. 
>> CERTAINLY NO DOUBT ABOUT 
THAT.
THIS HAS NOT BEEN A GOOD DAY FOR
THE PRESIDENT.
HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOUND 
GUILTY AND PERHAPS THE 
CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE, THE 
HEADLINE SAYS IT ALL.
GEORGE TRUMPS HELD HOUR.
THAT IS HOW THIS IS BEING 
DESCRIBED.
HELL HOUR.
>> CHARGES AGAINST HIS FORMER 
CAMPAIGN CHAIR.
HIS FORMER PERSONAL ATTORNEY.
PAUL MANAFORT CONVICTED ON 8 
CHARGES OF TAX EVASION AND BANK 
FRAUD.
MICHAEL COHEN PLEADING GUILTY 
TODAY ON CHARGES OF BANK FRAUD 
AND TAX EVASION AND CAMPAIGN 
FINANCE VIOLATIONS CONNECTED TO 
THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A
