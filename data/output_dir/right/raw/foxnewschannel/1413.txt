1
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:09,105
>> GAS PRICES ARE UP, YOU

2
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,206
PROBABLY NOTICED THAT BEFORE I

3
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:11,874
DID AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE ARE

4
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:13,209
MOVING INTO THE SUMMER.

5
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:15,645
REGULAR GALLON OF GAS IS UP 6

6
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:19,081
CENTS FROM THIS TIME LAST YEAR.

7
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:21,217
THE INCREASE COST OF FUEL IS

8
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:22,985
ALREADY WIPING OUT A BIG CHUNK

9
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:24,420
OF THE BENEFIT AMERICANS

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,222
RECEIVED FROM GOP TAX CUT AND

11
00:00:26,222 --> 00:00:29,025
THINGS COULD GET WORSE AS SUMMER

12
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:29,759
APPROACHES FOLLOWING

13
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,761
ADMINISTRATION'S STANDOFF WITH

14
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:34,063
IRAN OIL-PRODUCING NATIONS TO

15
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:36,165
TIGHT SUPPLIES, WHAT'S GOING ON

16
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:37,433
HERE, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, HE

17
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:39,535
WORKED ON THREE PRESIDENTIAL

18
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:42,038
CAMPAIGNS AND MICHAEL STAR

19
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:43,839
HOPKINS-DEMOCRATIC STRATEGISTS

20
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:46,075
AND HUFFINGTON POST CONTRIBUTOR.

21
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:48,511
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

22
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:49,378
>> FOR REPUBLICANS, DOES THIS

23
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:51,213
PUT THEM ON DEFENSE IN MIDTERMS,

24
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:52,848
WE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THE TAX

25
00:00:52,848 --> 00:00:55,651
CUTS ARE GOING TO BE A GREAT

26
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,653
BOOM TO REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES IN

27
00:00:57,653 --> 00:00:59,889
NOVEMBER, NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN,

28
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,324
IF AMERICANS SPEND SUMMER GOING

29
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:03,859
TO BEACH OR PICNIC AND GAS

30
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,594
PRICES ARE HIGH, THAT SEEMS LIKE

31
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:06,729
A POLITICAL PROP?

32
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:07,530
>> NOT ONLY THE SUMMER, BUT

33
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,331
THINK ABOUT THE UPCOMING FALL

34
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:11,667
AND WINTER, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT

35
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:12,101
THIS.

36
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:13,402
EVERY ECONOMIST FOR THE MOST

37
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:15,671
PART ACROSS THE BOARD DOES --

38
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:17,606
ALL THE STUDIES INDICATE THAT

39
00:01:17,606 --> 00:01:20,710
CONSUMER SPENDING IS UP AND WITH

40
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,678
THAT MEANS IS THAT THE TAX BREAK

41
00:01:22,678 --> 00:01:26,215
IS WORKING AND MORE MONEY IN

42
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:30,986
THEIR ACCOUNTS, 401(K),

43
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:31,921
INVESTMENTS A LOT BETTER THAN

44
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:33,522
WHAT THEY DID YEARS AGO, WHEN

45
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:35,891
YOU THINK ABOUT THE INCREASE IN

46
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:37,593
GAS PRICES, IF YOU'RE A FAMILY

47
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:40,996
OF 4 AND WANT TO TAKE A

48
00:01:40,996 --> 00:01:45,634
VACATION, YOU THINK ABOUT HOW

49
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:47,036
THIS IMPACT INDIVIDUALS ACROSS

50
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:49,972
THE BOARD AND I DO THINK

51
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:51,507
REPUBLICANS DO HAVE TO CONSIDER

52
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:53,209
HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT IN

53
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:56,712
MIDTERMS IF OUR SOUL GOVERNMENT

54
00:01:56,712 --> 00:02:00,082
IS GIVING SOMETHING AND

55
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:01,150
ARTICULATE THE MESSAGE WHEN YOU

56
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,852
LOOK AT THE RISING PRICES OF

57
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:03,519
GAS.

58
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,787
>> SO, MICHAEL, THERE'S SOME

59
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:06,055
HONEST TALK THERE, SOME STRAIGHT

60
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:07,656
TALK THERE FROM YOUR REPUBLICAN

61
00:02:07,656 --> 00:02:09,091
COLLEAGUE ABOUT HOW THERE COULD

62
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:10,425
BE CHALLENGES FOR THEM, ON THE

63
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:11,894
OTHER HAND, I'M LOOKING AT NEW

64
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:13,262
YORK TIMES HEADLINE TODAY THAT

65
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:16,866
SAYS AMONG OTHER THINGS

66
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:19,168
DEMOCRATS WILL AVOID DISASTER IN

67
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:20,436
CALIFORNIA HOUSE, 3 OR 4 HOUSE

68
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:21,804
SEAT IT IS DEMOCRATS THOUGHT

69
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:25,007
WERE GOING TO BE SLAM DUNKS FOR

70
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:26,308
THEM AND MAYBE REPUBLICANS WILL

71
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:27,910
HOLD ONTO SEATS AND MAYBE BLUE

72
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,445
WAVE IS NOT WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

73
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:30,546
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

74
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:31,847
>> I THINK DEMOCRATS HAVE A GOOD

75
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:32,982
CHANCE TO RECAPTURE THE HOUSE

76
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:35,651
BUT I THINK DEMOCRATS DO HAVE A

77
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:37,553
PROBLEM WITH MESSAGING.

78
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:38,754
THE TAX BILL HAS BEEN POPULAR

79
00:02:38,754 --> 00:02:41,357
BUT ALSO WE HAVE SEEN LOWER

80
00:02:41,357 --> 00:02:42,758
MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE NOT RECEIVE

81
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:44,593
SOME OF THE BENEFITS THEY

82
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:46,295
EXPECTED, IT'S PRODUCED A MIXED

83
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:47,663
MESSAGE FOR DEMOCRATS, ON ONE

84
00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:48,998
END, THERE'S CRITIQUES THAT NEED

85
00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:50,699
TO BE MADE ON THE TAX BILL BUT

86
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,568
ON THE OTHER PART, WHEN YOU LOOK

87
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:54,370
AT SPEAKER PELOSI AND COMMENTS

88
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,938
ABOUT CRUMBS, THEY HAVE BEEN

89
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:57,406
HURTFUL FOR DEMOCRATS, A

90
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:59,675
MEASURED APPROACH IS NEEDED.

91
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:01,110
>> REAL QUICK.

92
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,011
I WAS GOING TO SAY REALLY

93
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:03,145
QUICKLY, THE DEMOCRATS DON'T

94
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:04,814
HAVE A MESSAGE, FOR MOST PART

95
00:03:04,814 --> 00:03:06,182
THEIR ENTIRE MESSAGE HAS BEEN

96
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:06,882
REPLACE DONALD TRUMP.

97
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:09,051
WE HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, GET RID OF

98
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:11,787
HIM, HE'S DOING A HORRIBLE JOB.

99
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:12,822
LOOK, AMERICANS MAY DISAGREE

100
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:16,158
WITH ASPECTS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP,

101
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,795
I DISAGREE WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS

102
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:21,931
BUT IF YOU YOU LOOK AT POLICY,

103
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:24,533
WE ARE SEEING SUCCESS, POLICY,

104
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,101
WHETHER THAT'S DOMESTICALLY, YOU

105
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:27,269
START TALKING ABOUT WELFARE

106
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:29,138
ISSUES THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

107
00:03:29,138 --> 00:03:30,840
MENTIONED, WE WILL DO WELFARE

108
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,841
REFORM, YOU TALK ABOUT

109
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:32,908
INFRASTRUCTURE, THE PRESIDENT

110
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:34,143
HAS TALKED ABOUT CERTAINLY

111
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:35,344
THINGS AS WELL, THERE'S SUCCESS

112
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:37,913
THAT YOU CAN CLEARLY POINT TO.

113
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,815
>> YOU THE POSSIBILITY, THE

114
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:44,987
DEMOCRATS WERE LAUGHING AT

115
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:47,189
PRESIDENT AND NOW MAYBE PEACE

116
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:48,657
TALKS AFTER ALL.

117
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:49,592
YOU HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT, HISTORIC

118
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:51,961
LOWS NOT JUST ACROSS THE BOARD

119
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:53,629
FOR HISPANICS AND AFRICAN

120
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:56,232
AMERICANS, WHAT PART OF PEACE

121
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:58,734
AND PROSPERITY DOES NOT LIKE?

122
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:00,202
>> IT'S NOT THE ISSUE ABOUT NOT

123
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:01,570
LIKING PEACE AND PROSPERITY,

124
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:14,683
WHAT WE WANT IS EQUALITY FOR ALL

125
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:15,818
I THINK IF DEMOCRATS CAN

126
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:17,952
CONTINUE TO PUSH A MESSAGE THAT

127
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:19,721
BRINGS TOGETHER DEMOCRATS,

128
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,555
REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS,

129
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:23,459
THEN IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT

130
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,126
2018.

131
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:25,427
>> MICHAEL, I AGREE WITH

132
00:04:25,427 --> 00:04:26,662
ECONOMIC SUCCESS FOR ALL.

133
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:28,030
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT CERTAIN

134
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,732
-- LET'S LOOK AT THIS LOCALLY,

135
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:31,033
IF YOU LOOK AT CONGRESSIONAL

136
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:32,935
DISTRICT AS CROSS THE COUNTRY

137
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:34,003
PARTICULAR THOSE HEAVILY

138
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:35,237
MINORITY, YOU LOOK AT THE LACK

139
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:36,438
OF ECONOMIC MOBILITY, YOU LOOK

140
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:37,973
AT   TECHS AND OPPORTUNITY, LOOK

141
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:41,043
AT THE ENTREPRENEURIAL

142
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:41,944
OPPORTUNITIES, WHEN YOU TALK

143
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:44,113
ABOUT DEMOCRATS BEING AS PART

144
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:46,248
AND WANT SUCCESS IN MOBILITY AND

145
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:47,750
PEOPLE, I HAVE TO PUSH BACK

146
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,951
BECAUSE ALL INDICATORS DON'T

147
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:50,853
SHOW THAT'S THE CASE.

148
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:52,221
>> MICHAEL, I WILL LET YOU MAKE

149
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,055
THE LAST POINT.

150
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:54,290
WALL STREET JOURNAL HAS THE

151
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,058
THING TODAY THAT BASICALLY TALKS

152
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:58,060
ABOUT TAX REVENUE SOARING IN

153
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,662
SOME DEMOCRATIC STATES LIKE NEW

154
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:03,666
YORK, CONNECTICUT, CALIFORNIA.

155
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,733
UNEXPECTEDLY BLUE STATES BECAUSE

156
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:05,834
OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID, THERE

157
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:08,404
WERE SOME TAXES GOING UP IN

158
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:10,072
THOSE STATES AND REVENUES GOING

159
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:12,574
UP BUT ALSO BECAUSE CORPORATE

160
00:05:12,574 --> 00:05:14,410
PROFITS ARE SOARING RIGHT NOW

161
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,011
AND WE'VE HEARD DEMOCRATS SAY,

162
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:17,913
THEY ARE GOING TO PUT IT IN

163
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:19,148
POCKET, THEY ARE HELPING JERRY

164
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:20,349
BROWN IN CALIFORNIA.

165
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:22,184
HE'S HELPING DEAL WITH BUDGET

166
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:23,118
DEFICITS BECAUSE CORPORATIONS

167
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:24,753
ARE PAYING MORE IN TAXES IN SOME

168
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:25,854
OF THE STATES BECAUSE THE

169
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:28,223
ECONOMY IS SO GOOD.

170
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:29,191
>> WELL, I AGREE WITH YOU ON

171
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:29,992
THAT POINT.

172
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:31,660
I'D SAY IF YOU IN A POSITION

173
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,028
WHERE YOU CAN INVEST IN THE

174
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:34,596
STOCK MARKET, YOU CAN BUY REAL

175
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:36,131
ESTATE, THEN YOU ARE IN A GOOD

176
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:37,599
POSITION, THAT'S NOT A LOT OF

177
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,600
AMERICANS, AND WHAT WE ARE

178
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,636
SEEING IS BASICALLY A CORPORATE

179
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:43,005
BAIL-OUT IF YOU'RE BIG PHARMA,

180
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:44,707
IF YOU'RE BIG OIL, IF YOU'RE IN

181
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:47,609
BANKING, THOSE INDUSTRIES HAVE

182
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:50,179
SEEN --

183
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:50,646
[INAUDIBLE]

184
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:52,348
>> WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT BONUSES

185
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:55,317
REALLY HELP, A LOT OF AVERAGE

186
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:57,286
WORKERS HAVE GOTTEN BONUSES.

187
00:05:57,286 --> 00:06:01,023
>> THEY HAVE SEEN COSTS GO UP,

188
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:02,725
