breaking news tonight NBC News has confirmed that Don McGann is out as white House Counsel today was done against the last day according to to White House officials the New York Times which first reported the news says mr. McGann may have also caused more damage for mr. Trump than any other White House official in the Special Counsel investigation mr. McGann has spent at least 30 hours with mr. mullahs investigators laying out how mr. Trump tried to interfere with or quash the inquiry including by trying to fire mr. Muller himself in the summer of 2017 federal prosecutors met with president Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen today at his Attorney's office a person familiar with the matter tells NBC News Michael Cohen met with quote a group of state and federal law enforcement officials investigating various aspects of President Donald Trump's family business and charitable organization according to cnn.com yesterday President Trump was asked about Michael Cohen's plea deal with federal prosecutors for the first time in an interview with The Associated Press The Associated Press asked the president quote Cohen testified under oath in federal court that you directed him to commit a crime did you sir Trump replied totally false it's totally false The Associated Press followed up with so he's lying under oath president Trump replied oh absolutely he's lying and Michael Cohen was a PR person who did small legal work very small legal work he represented me very little it's a very low level in April when Michael Cohen's home office in hotel room were raided by the FBI President Trump said this it's a disgrace it's frankly a real disgrace it's a an attack on our country at a true sense draya's now John Heilemann national affairs analyst for NBC News and MSNBC he's co-host and executive Research Show times the circus and Mimi wrote as well as a former federal prosecutor and the MSNBC legal contributor and John President Trump in in accusing Michael Kohn of being a liar tells the lie that Michael Cohen was just a small player in his operation who had very little to do with Donald Trump yes barely knew him I hardly hard to imagine that even has an opinion about my cocoa and I not sure he's ever heard of the man he's never had any part of Donald Trump's life whatsoever the only thing I think that's true Lawrence of the things that Donald Trump said about Michael Cohen is that he did very little legal work for Donald Trump because it doesn't seem like he actually did very much legal work for Donald Trump because he's not really a lawyer he also didn't do much PR work although he did represent Trump in the press to some extent when he did for Donald Trump in the period of time the decade or so that he worked with Donald Trump not a little bit but a lot every day for many hours every day and if you ever dealt with Donald Trump in those 10 years or so you knew the Michael Cohen was the guy you had to talk to to have any kind of interaction with Donald Trump what he did was not legal work or PR work but was business development work he was the guy who made deals for Donald Trump he was the guy who cleaned up Donald Trump's problems he was the ray Donovan guy he was the guy who went to Moscow and tried to make Trump Tower Moscow happen and to many other countries around the world so is Trump telling the truth about the fact that Michael clone was not much of a lawyer for him yes was his Donald Trump telling the truth about anything else related to Michael Cohen's degree of involvement in his life no all of that is a grotesque lie and Vanity Fair's reporting tonight about Michael Cohen despite having no formal cooperation agreement with the government Cohen has willingly assisted and provided information critical to several ongoing investigations according to two sources familiar with the situation in a string of meetings that have exceeded more than 50 hours mirakl what does that tell you that's a lot of time it tells me he's got a lot of information and they are interested in hearing what he has to say everyone should understand though no one's gonna take Michael Cohen's word at face value they're not gonna just write down what he says and then you know going to the grand jury and base charges against anyone or any entity on that alone they are going to try and corroborate and cross-reference and you know double-check as much as they humanly can and that is often a lot particularly when we're talking about information about the Trump Organization you know it sounds like Cohen is giving information in so many diff and avenues here we you know he's talking to Muller or that's what's been reported we know now that he's talking to the Southern District and the New York AG's office so that is going to dovetail with the tax investigations that we know the New York AG's office is looking at clearly there the Southern District is you know expanded beyond just Michael Cohen and is looking more broadly at the Trump organization and its role in these hush money payments and other things like that so Cohen has so much different information and jeonse exactly right he probably you know you don't call him a lawyer find doesn't matter what you put all of you could talk of a PR person you could call him a guy it really doesn't matter what matters is what he knows and that's what's being conveyed now and that's important very very busy prosecutors have decided to spend 50 hours with him he knows something Lanny Davis made a comment to The Associated Press today were in they reported as Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis told USA Today his client had two words for the president's claims on truth versus lies audio and tape he said the president should be worried John Hammond Lanny Davis is two words audio and tape yes that actually sort of clarifies the point that Mimi was just making which is it doesn't really matter whether we call him an attorney a PR person or a business development person then what we should really call him is he's the guy who has the goods and the goods are in the form of audio and so to me means point yes Michael Cohen is also a liar someone who has lied too many people on many occasions on Donald Trump's behalf and I'm certain that if he thought he could get away with lying to prosecutors in order to reduce his sentence going forward he would lie to them too but he knows two things one is that if he gets caught lying to prosecutors it does him no good he's trying to stay out of jail so he has an incentive to tell the truth in this instance and the second thing he has Lanny Davis suggests is some amount of audio tape we've heard some of the audio already some of its public much more of it is not yet public and so in the end the value that Michael Cohen has to bring to prosecutors and the threat that he poses to Donald Trump is the breadth of his knowledge and the ability to back it up not just with his word but with hard evidence in the form of audio rod Rosenstein who we all know has been supervising Robert the Murat mullahs investigation said this today to The Wall Street Journal the roster Journal reports it as mr. Rosenstein offered a forceful defense of the inquiry saying the public would have faith in its findings at the end of the day the public will have confidence that the cases we brought were warranted by the evidence and that was an appropriate use of resources and me that is a strong expression of confidence by Ruud Rosen Stein who knows that these findings will be thrown into a political crossfire it's also just extraordinary that he did this interview and that he did it now so close to the election shortly after the meeting with Trump on the plane that made people sort of question whether he was still operating independently and I wonder I mean we don't know for sure but I wonder if that's part of why he did this and you know there were some mixed messages I think and some of the things residents unsaid but I think that that quote that you pointed to really does seem to be saying look there's stuff coming down the pike and whatever happens whatever you might be planning to do mr. president you know the people are watching and are gonna have faith in this investigation and that's a very strong statement for him to make right now and John given Justice Department rules on this the Republicans can relax presumably between now and Election Day that the special prosecutor won't be revealing anything dramatic or serious between now and that time right yeah I think that's right and and look we saw some reporting also today I believe it this morning in Bloomberg that suggested that some sources close to the Muller inquiry inquiry we're suggesting that that Muller was pretty close to rolling out some charges the kinds of things that they're kind of hinted batterer suggested by the Rosenstein interview right after the election and and certainly we've all been waiting for a long time we've thought that Bob Muller was more or less done with the exception of an interview with Trump he was more or less done with the obstruction piece of his inquiry those charges may be ready to roll again once that negotiation is done with the White House brought to conclusion one way or the other with Donald Trump I think you know the Republicans can breathe easy between now and November 6th but we could have a pretty busy time immediately following November 6th before Thanksgiving even it's possible thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC
