1
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,258
>> Laura: YOU JUST HEARD DINESH

2
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:15,693
D'SOUZA TELL US ABOUT THE

3
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:17,094
HORRORS OF THE OBAMA

4
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:19,797
ADMINISTRATION, WHICH I ASKED

5
00:00:19,797 --> 00:00:27,304
MIKE ABOUT A SHORT WHILE AGO.

6
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:28,906
DINESH D'SOUZA ABOUT THE HORRORS

7
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:30,574
OF THE POLITICAL PROSECUTIONS,

8
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:32,643
WHAT HE BELIEVES, BY THE OBAMA

9
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:33,143
ADMINISTRATION.

10
00:00:33,143 --> 00:00:34,712
AND HIS EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY HAS

11
00:00:34,712 --> 00:00:36,847
SOME IMPLICATION, I THINK, FOR

12
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:37,981
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, AS WE

13
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:39,583
MIGHT LOOK AT THIS UNHOLY

14
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,252
ALLIANCE OF THE FBI DIRECTOR JIM

15
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:43,654
COMEY AND DOJ PROSECUTORS.

16
00:00:43,654 --> 00:00:45,155
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT, FOR

17
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:47,691
LACK OF A BETTER TERM, THIS

18
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:48,726
RUNAWAY PROSECUTION THAT A LOT

19
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:49,860
OF US ARE CONCERNED ABOUT?

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,862
>> I THINK THAT IN THE NORMAL

21
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:54,965
COURSE, THAT SORT OF CASE WOULD

22
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:55,866
HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED WITH THE

23
00:00:55,866 --> 00:01:00,671
OUTCOME BEING A FINE.

24
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:05,042
IT'S NOT ONE OF THE BRIGHTER

25
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:06,443
CHAPTERS THAT HE PARTICIPATED IN

26
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:07,578
PROSECUTING THIS IN THE WAY THAT

27
00:01:07,578 --> 00:01:08,011
HE DID.

28
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:09,980
WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF OTHER

29
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,948
DINGS AND DENTS.

30
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:14,118
BUT THAT WAS, I THINK, A PRETTY

31
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:14,985
SUBSTANTIAL ONE.

32
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:18,789
>> Laura: JUDGE MUKASEY, ADAM

33
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:23,127
SCHIFF SAID THE PARDON OF DINESH

34
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:27,264
D'SOUZA IS BASICALLY AN APPARENT

35
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:28,499
SIGNAL BY THE PRESIDENT TO

36
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:29,900
SIGNAL OTHERS, LOOK, IF YOU DO

37
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,736
RIGHT BY ME, I'LL DO RIGHT BY

38
00:01:32,736 --> 00:01:33,036
YOU.

39
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:34,738
>> IT'S FURTHER EVIDENCE OF A

40
00:01:34,738 --> 00:01:36,440
CORRUPT INTENT ON THE

41
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,274
PRESIDENT'S PART.

42
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:38,575
FURTHER EVIDENCE HE MAY HAVE

43
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:41,078
VIOLATED THE LAW BY OBSTRUCTING

44
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:43,046
JUSTICE, IN THE FIRING OF COMEY,

45
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:44,381
BUT IN OTHER EFFORTS AS WELL.

46
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:46,550
IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE A MESSAGE TO

47
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,420
MICHAEL CULLEN WHO MAY ALSO BE

48
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,355
IMPLICATED IN EXCEEDING CAMPAIGN

49
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:53,257
LIMITS WITH THAT STORMY DANIELS

50
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:53,590
PAYMENT.

51
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,725
YOU HAVE THE FURTHER

52
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:55,659
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

53
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:57,661
THAT HE MAY PARDON MARTHA

54
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:59,763
STUDENT, ANOTHER TV PERSONALITY

55
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:01,498
WHO WAS CONVICTED OF, GUESS

56
00:02:01,498 --> 00:02:03,066
WHAT, OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND

57
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:05,402
LYING TO AUTHORITIES.

58
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:06,503
NOTHING ABOUT TRANSPARENT.

59
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:08,839
>> THEY SAID THE SAME THING

60
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:11,108
EVERY TIME HE EITHER ISSUES A

61
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:12,843
PARDON OR MAKES A STATEMENT,

62
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:15,813
THAT IT'S A SIGNAL, A DOG

63
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:18,115
WHISTLE, SO ON, SO FORTH.

64
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:20,184
I THINK THE PROSECUTION OF

65
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:22,519
D'SOUZA, AND THE WAY IT WAS

66
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:23,687
DONE, IS UNJUSTIFIED.

67
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:26,023
I THINK THE PROSECUTION OF

68
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:29,593
MARTHA STEWART WAS DUBIOUS.

69
00:02:29,593 --> 00:02:32,729
NOW, THE PRESIDENT COMMUTED

70
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:33,597
BLAGOJEVICH'S SENTENCE.

71
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:36,200
HE SERVED SIX YEARS.

72
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,136
AND THAT'S A JUDGMENT CALL.

73
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:40,804
HE WAS CERTAINLY NOT PARDONED.

74
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:43,674
>> Laura: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT

75
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:45,642
JOHN BRENNAN HAS BEEN UP TO.

76
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:47,244
HE'S NOW A COMMENTATOR ON

77
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:48,045
ANOTHER XHETWORK.

78
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:52,082
OF COURSE, FORMER TOP INTEL

79
00:02:52,082 --> 00:02:53,083
OFFICIAL, U.S. GOVERNMENT.

80
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,585
HE HAS BEEN ON A TEAR WITH

81
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:55,085
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

82
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:57,120
>> I THINK MR. TRUMP HAS

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,223
DEMONSTRATED A PARANOIA IN HIS

84
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:01,525
SECURITY, AS WELL AS A REAL

85
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:02,292
CONCERN ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION

86
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:03,460
THAT IS UNDER WAY.

87
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,629
CERTAINLY HIS TWEETS DO NOT SEEM

88
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:07,331
LIKE THEY'RE COMING FROM A

89
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:10,634
PERSON OF INNOCENCE AND

90
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:11,034
CONFIDENCE.

91
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:12,669
>> MY REACTION IS, ORDINARILY,

92
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:14,972
WOULD BE THAT JOHN BRENNAN WAS

93
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:17,508
DIRECTOR OF THE CIA, MAYBE

94
00:03:17,508 --> 00:03:18,942
SHOULD BE TOLD TO STICK TO HIS

95
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:19,443
DAY JOB.

96
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:21,445
THE TROUBLE IS, GIVEN WHAT WE'RE

97
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:22,646
FINDING OUT ABOUT THE WAY HE DID

98
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:24,014
HIS DAY JOB, INCLUDING HIS

99
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:26,583
PARTICIPATION IN PUTTING AN

100
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,652
INFORMANT INTO THE TRUMP

101
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:29,853
CAMPAIGN, MAYBE WE'RE BETTER OFF

102
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:32,289
WITH HIM AS KIND OF AN AMATEUR

103
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:32,623
PUNDIT.

104
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:34,358
I THINK HE MAY BE PROJECTING HIS

105
00:03:34,358 --> 00:03:37,895
OWN VIEWS, IF I MAY BE AN

106
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:38,762
AMATEUR PSYCHIATRIST FOR A

107
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:39,963
MOMENT, ONTO THE PRESIDENT.

108
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:40,697
BECAUSE HE IS GOING TO HAVE A

109
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:43,867
LOT TO ANSWER FOR.

110
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:45,903
I BELIEVE WHEN THE ENTIRE STORY

111
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:47,504
GETS TOLD ABOUT WHAT THE CIA WAS

112
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,006
DOING IN CONNECTION WITH THE

113
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:51,508
RUNNING OF THE INVESTIGATION,

114
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:53,043
AND WHAT IT WAS DOING WITH

115
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:55,212
REGARD TO WHAT HAD BEEN ITS

116
00:03:55,212 --> 00:03:57,648
INFORMANT, AND HIS BEING PUT

117
00:03:57,648 --> 00:04:00,017
INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

118
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:03,687
>> Laura: WE TALKED ABOUT -- A

119
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,322
LITTLE ABOUT THIS ON RADIO THIS

120
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:05,989
MORNING, JUDGE.

121
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:07,124
YOU ASKED THIS QUESTION WHICH IS

122
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:09,793
WHY YOU'RE SO SMART, WHO PAID

123
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:11,895
THIS INFORM MAPT, WAS HE JUST

124
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:14,865
DOING THIS PRO BONO, THE WORK

125
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:16,867
FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN?

126
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,601
OR FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT?

127
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:20,269
WHO PAID?

128
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,207
>> UNDERSTAND, HIS HISTORY WAS

129
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:27,110
AS A CIA ASSET.

130
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,812
BEING PUT INTO AN FBI

131
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:31,415
INVESTIGATION IS VERY ODD.

132
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:33,817
UNDERSTAND, THESE TWO AGENCIES,

133
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:35,018
NUMBERS ONE, DON'T SHARE THEIR

134
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:38,121
TOYS VERY WELL.

135
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:39,423
AND AREN'T SUPPOSED TO.

136
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:40,958
THE CIA IS SUPPOSED TO OPERATE

137
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,360
IN AN OUTWARD LOOKING, FOREIGN

138
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,795
DIRECTED FASHION.

139
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:46,296
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING

140
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:47,531
ANYTHING IN THE UNITED STATES.

141
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:49,433
THERE'S A STATUTE THAT RESTRICTS

142
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:49,733
THAT.

143
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,201
THE FBI CONDUCTS INTELLIGENCE

144
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:52,269
INVESTIGATIONS IN THE UNITED

145
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:52,603
STATES.

146
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:56,239
AND FOR HIM TO BE PUT INTO

147
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,107
ESSENTIALLY AN FBI

148
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:59,209
INVESTIGATION, I KIND OF WOULD

149
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:00,644
LIKE TO KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED,

150
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:01,645
WHO COORDINATED IT, WHO PAID

151
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:06,984
HIM, AND HOW THAT WAS ARRANGED.

152
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:08,619
>> Laura: BARBARA McQUAID IS A

153
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:10,220
FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY APPOINTED

154
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,154
BY BARACK OBAMA, AND SHE SAID

155
00:05:11,154 --> 00:05:14,124
THE FOLLOWING TODAY.

156
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:16,026
>> I THINK TODAY'S NEWS ABOUT

157
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:17,394
MICHAEL COHEN REALLY SHOWS YOU

158
00:05:17,394 --> 00:05:19,429
WHAT HE EXPECTS IN AN ATTORNEY

159
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:19,763
GENERAL.

160
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:21,064
HIS EXPERIENCE WITH A LAWYER IS

161
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:23,367
SOMEONE LIKE MICHAEL COHEN, A

162
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:24,601
PIT BULL, SOMEONE WHO WILL

163
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,069
PROTECT HIM, SOMEONE WHO WILL BE

164
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:28,505
VERY AGGRESSIVE IN DEFENDING HIS

165
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:29,940
INTERESTS, NO MATTER WHAT.

166
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,274
BEING LOYAL TO PRESIDENT TRUMP,

167
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:32,876
AS OPPOSED TO LOYAL TO THE

168
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:33,210
MISSION.

169
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,278
AND IF THAT IS HIS MOTIVATION,

170
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:35,979
THAT IS A CRIME.

171
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:38,715
>> FOR HER TO COMMENT ON WHAT

172
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:40,617
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EXPECTATIONS

173
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:41,752
ARE AND HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL

174
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:42,719
WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO

175
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,087
SERVED IN THE OBAMA

176
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:45,188
ADMINISTRATION, ERIC HOLDER,

177
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:47,658
REFERRED TO HIMSELF AS THE

178
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:48,425
PRESIDENT'S WINGMAN, STRIKES ME

179
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:50,727
AS PRETTY RICH.

180
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:51,361
>> Laura: YEAH, YOU WERE

181
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:53,163
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

182
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:55,699
TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP

183
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:57,501
BETWEEN A PRESIDENT AND THE

184
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,101
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

185
00:05:58,101 --> 00:05:59,736
PEOPLE ARE MAKING THIS OUT TO BE

186
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:02,406
SUCH A CRIME, THAT PRESIDENT

187
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:04,174
TRUMP WANTED AN ATTORNEY GENERAL

188
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:06,910
WHOSE FIRST INSTINCT IT WAS NOT

189
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,213
TO RECUSE HIMSELF.

190
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:11,114
THE RECUSAL ISSUE IS SOMETHING

191
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:12,816
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE.

192
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:13,884
BUT THAT HAS STUCK IN THE

193
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:14,651
PRESIDENT'S CRAW.

194
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:16,219
IF I WAS THE PRESIDENT, I WOULD

195
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:18,689
NOT BE TWEETING, I WISH I HADN'T

196
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:19,923
SELECTED JEFF SESSIONS.

197
00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:21,158
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE THINKS THAT

198
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:21,692
GETS HIM.

199
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:23,493
I DON'T THINK THAT'S

200
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:24,828
PARTICULARLY WISE TO DO.

201
00:06:24,828 --> 00:06:25,562
BUT NEVERTHELESS, THAT'S HOW HE

202
00:06:25,562 --> 00:06:29,066
FEELS.

203
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,101
HE THOUGHT, WHY AM I APPOINTING

204
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:32,135
YOU ATTORNEY GENERAL, IF THE

205
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:35,172
FIRST THING YOU DO IS RECUSE

206
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:35,539
YOURSELF.

207
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:36,606
>> WELL, THE CIRCUMSTANCES KIND

208
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:38,508
OF CAUGHT UP WITH JEFF SESSIONS,

209
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:40,243
AND WITH THE PRESIDENT.

210
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:41,912
AND AT THE TIME THAT JEFF

211
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:44,715
SESSIONS RECUSED HIMSELF, IT MAY

212
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:46,016
BE THAT HE TECHNICALLY DIDN'T

213
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:47,551
HAVE TO, BECAUSE THE

214
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,352
INVESTIGATION AT THAT POINT WAS

215
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:49,953
A FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE

216
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:51,455
INVESTIGATION, NOT A CRIMINAL

217
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:52,656
INVESTIGATION.

218
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:54,224
BUT THEN DUE IN LARGE MEASURE

219
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:55,125
THE THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT

220
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,127
SAID AND DID, IT BECAME A

221
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:57,761
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

222
00:06:57,761 --> 00:07:00,797
AND AT THAT POINT, REGULATIONS

223
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:02,265
REQUIRED THAT JEFF SESSIONS

224
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:03,667
RECUSE HIMSELF.

225
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,302
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO SUGGEST

226
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:06,837
SOMEHOW JEFF SESSIONS SHOULD

227
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:09,773
HAVE HAD THE GIFT OF PROPHECY

228
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:11,108
AND THE SITUATION WOULD DEVELOP

229
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:12,776
THAT WAY WAS RIDICULOUS, AND FOR

230
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:14,211
HIM TO START CLAIMING HE SHOULD

231
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:18,115
HAVE APPOINTED SOMEBODY ELSE IS

232
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:18,415
INANE.

233
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:20,150
IT DOESN'T, AS YOU POINT OUT, IT

234
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,284
DOESN'T SERVE HIS INTEREST,

235
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:23,353
PARTICULARLY WHEN HE'S GOT AN AG

236
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:25,455
IN PLACE IN A PERSON IN JEFF

237
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:27,324
SESSIONS WHO IS PURSUING HIS

238
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:29,659
AGENDA, AND VERY EFFECTIVELY,

239
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:33,296
BRINGING IN M-13 CASES,

240
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:36,366
CONCLUDING A HUGE ANTITRUST

241
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:37,501
SETTLEMENT, EFFECTIVELY RUNNING

242
00:07:37,501 --> 00:00:00,000
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
