yes I order with this we get a big mad chicken Debbie a big french fries yeah yes one of those yeah yeah I'll take the fish my parts oh that's good so basic yeah okay I'll take a beer pay up here okay take it I'm on a mission and Barcelona Spain to try McDonald's menu items that you can't get in America but before it gets the food I want to start with the beer at this location they only serve one type the mahou cinco australian link it's cold it's light and it's good mostly because I think my beer was free I paid an additional zero euros for this beer which you absolutely cannot get at McDonald's back home in America moving to the food McDonald's in Spain serves fried potato wedges or the patatas deluxe as an alternative to regular french fries the potato wedges are soft and crispy at the same time and seasoned with a perfect amount of salt this is something I wish they served back home the fish Mick bites on the other hand made a brief appearance in America and 2013 but no one ate them I want to find out why the fish Mick bites come with something called the salsa creamy deluxe which I'm guessing loosely translates to tartar sauce this time it's not great there's too much breading which tastes exactly like the breading used in a Chicken McNugget and the sauce doesn't really enhance the flavor now it's time for the main event the big mac chicken for anyone who knows anything about McDonald's you know the traditional Big Mac consists of two all-beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions all on a sesame seed bun swap out the beef with to make chicken patties and you get the big Matt chicken it's that simple the first bite is confusing and unfamiliar when I taste the special sauce I expect beef to accompany in but the crispy chicken throws me off it gets better though by after bite after bite the sandwich progressively gets tastier I eat the whole thing and wonder why this isn't a thing in America so to sum it all up McDonald's in America should bring in the potato wedges and Big Mac chicken while the fish McBride's should remain banished and if they can include free beer with your meal sales will almost definitely pick up
