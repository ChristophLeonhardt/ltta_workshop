leaves that reading the numbers they're looking in the future everyone except Roy Moore of course we've gotten the word yet he is still calling for a recount areas we are indeed in a struggle to preserve our republic our civilization and our religion and is set free is suffering humanity and the battle rages on in this race we have not received the final count to include military and provisional ballots this has been a very close race and we are waiting certification by the Secretary of State all right so he's not going so anyway oh wait I've got a phone call it's just night judge more it's the judgment no no no we're not saying that you look like a black woman no no not at all not that anything would be wrong with that oh there is okay I didn't win the election so everybody is saying what's gonna happen in the future but the thing is I want to highlight some of the ways cuz you're gonna be thinking about this too and I want to highlight some of the ways that I really feel people are getting things wrong you know I'm reading we had Scott Adams on I don't know a week two weeks ago and because of problems in the mails I hadn't gotten his book in time to read it but now I'm reading I'm almost through with it it's a good it's a really really good book it's a really interesting book and he has this take on how good a persuader what he calls it a persuader Donald Trump is and his he backs this up by the fact that he actually predicted the Trump would win the election on the basis of his persuasive abilities he talks about he has this kind of atheist worldview that this is not to knock the book at all but it doesn't actually make sense with what he's saying because he says we can't know reality the human mind can't know reality so all we can do is have a worldview and the way you test your worldview is one does it make you happy and two does it predict the future now I've actually said almost the same thing except somewhat differently and I think mine takes in a greater degree of of the world that is I think that your worldview should make you joyful it doesn't shouldn't make you happy because when unhappy things happen you should be unhappy that means you're being a realist but it makes you joyful which by which I mean engaged with life a glad to be alive actively feeling the dynamic presence of life and you even when things are troubling or you know strike you with grief it should make you joyful and it should protect the future and it should fit the facts I mean and this is one of the things that I think I have a difference with Scott about because he says that he says he doesn't know people can't know reality but he'll say I abandoned a worldview because it didn't fit the facts said I used to believe in Santa and that predicted the future and it made me happy but it didn't fit the facts so you have to fit the facts as well but the thing is when people don't predict the future when they fail to predict the future accurately the thing the thing is that it actually is an insult to their worldview and they know it and Adams talks about cognitive dissonance which is that you think you're a smart guy but you did something stupid so you have to invent a fantasy that covers that up that papers that over so you don't think oh I wait maybe I'm stupid maybe I should get smarter people don't want to change their worldview and one of the number one ways people miss the future is they've predicted it wrong and they don't change their mind and that is one of the things that I feel is hell is happening has happened to many of our friends on the right who refuse to accept what's going on because we many of us including me including me said oh my gosh this guy is nightmare he's a disaster this is gonna be terrible if he gets elected it's gonna be a disaster and they don't want to let go of that worldview that was so wrong so they create this fantasy that he's a disaster that things are going wrong and the way they do that is predicting a future in which things will go wrong even if they're not going wrong right now but the fact is we don't know the future we don't know it's going to happen and even if it turns out they're right and disasters happen it won't be because they got got it right it'll just be because that was one of the possible futures the fact is the living fact is this has been politically one of the greatest years for conservatives in my memory which now goes back a fairly long way not since Reagan have we had you know people keep saying what a nice person george w bush was that's very true but he was not a conservative and people keep complaining that Donald Trump is going to drag conservatism into another place but don't forget that george w bush dragged conservatism into these this world into these world wars these very extensive foreign policy which is very very anti conservative conservatives were always the guys who said wait wait wait let's let's before we go to war let's see or we the police here are we the guys who have to do this but george w bush was going to impose democracy on a large swath of the of the world where which didn't want it and any whether you think that's right or not it was not the conservative policy the so the Bush family has despite their service beside their despite their personal decency it has skewed conservatism more than Donald Trump as I know I go through this list a lot but I'll just go through it really quickly again this has been the year in which Isis was defeated because of Donald Trump's policies it's a the year in which judges have been appointed I think it's over 60 or about 60 judges to the federal bench nominated to the federal bench who are actually constitutional conservatives and I heard Jonah Goldberg say well that's because Trump is delegating that to the Federalist Society I don't care why it is is whatever is Trump is doing it's getting done and the people on the right who said who kept they had this phrase but Gorsuch but Gorsuch everything would in their mind would be going wrong and they'd say oh yeah but he appointed Gorsuch that's the only good thing you can say about him listen if that Baker doesn't have to deliver cakes against his religious convictions at you know in that Supreme Court trial because of Gorsuch but course is just going to be a big big deal the regulations rollback is revolutionary and now the tax plan we're very close they've now say that the House and Senate have got a deal on the tax plan which means they could vote on it as early as next week so which would mean be getting it out there before the Democrat comes in Doug Jones comes in from Alabama so that's a big deal here is Trump it's talking about the tax plan when government loosens its grip there is no summit we cannot reach our tax cuts will break down and they'll break it down fast all forms of government and all forms of government barriers and breathe new life into the American economy it's it's a this to a big deal and a big deal for the economy almost everyone is saying now is admitting now that the cuts especially to the corporate rate will jumpstart the economy even more than it's already been jump-started and Brett Stevens who hates Trump with all his heart he basically voted for Clinton left The Wall Street Journal to go to the New York Times a former newspaper he wrote a piece today saying Democrats are walking into a trumpian trap that is they keep telling themselves they're going to destroy the Republican Party and may look maybe they will midterms are usually bad for the party in power but listen this is yours Larry Sabato from the UVA political you know whatever it is think-tank listen to the way he's talking people get a sense of a president and I don't think Donald Trump has a clue how most people look at him and it's now a large majority who look askance at him and are very critical he stirs the pot three or four times and makes another million enemies so so he thinks he thinks that he doesn't know that Trump doesn't know I'm gonna get back to that in a minute the guy the guy I wanted was the the strategist Steve Schmidt talking about numbers cut number two this party has demonstrated they complete incapacity to govern period and I think that there will be a tsunami come 2018 that wipes all he's talking about is the fact that he doesn't like Donald Trump if this tax bill passes that's a lot of that's an awful big bill to get in your first year again all the other things the ISIS the regulations the judges where is the failure to govern the failure to govern is that he didn't predict what was going to happen he doesn't like this guy and this is this is number two okay people underestimate they underestimate and dismiss what they don't like they underestimate I mean ask yourself for a minute people people on the right the never Trump right or what now they call themselves Trump skeptic right they were celebrating they were celebrating that we had lost a vote in the Senate this was a good thing this was a good thing why why is it a good thing I mean this as I said I think we were being played but I'll get back to that in a minute but people don't like Trump and you have to ask yourself look I like I've said I don't know if always like Trump sometimes Trump does stuff that makes me my Gorge Rises at self there's what difference does it make whether you like him or not that is pure emotionalism and one of the things Adams talks about in Adams like he's a trained persuader he's taking hypnotism classes and things like this and he's taking a lot of the read a lot of books about how to persuade people and he's worked in business and he says Trump is using classic persuasive techniques they don't see it because he doesn't sound like a typical Paul tician because he says things that they don't like people are our misjudging him under giant because they don't like him but you have to ask yourself what difference does it make if you don't like somebody it really makes no difference whatsoever I'm gonna stay on let's stay on today we have Christian todo coming on to talk about Hollywood so we'll stay on Facebook and YouTube so you can hear Christian come on and and talk about that stuff but please subscribe you got to subscribe you know you get the for a hundred lousy bucks he at the left of

stockings and find that they got coal so come on on and subscribe but I will stay on and before I get on to way number three that people don't foresee the future let's talk about Omaha Steaks you know what this is actually one of the best things this has been a great year I was talking about a great year free content service there's been a great year for The Daily wire I I've had a wonderful time

search bar and get a 75% saving it's the gift guaranteed to be a it will I have dined on them myself and I can vouch for them alright number three way that people are mistaking the future is they do not account for unintended consequences and this has been a year of unintended consequences unlooked-for consequences who among you not me but who among you would have said if Donald Trump is elected we are going to clear out some of these sex offenders in the media we're gonna clear out these guys who abuse women in the middle who would have said that and they you know they're running on all these articles about how it's because women felt helpless and traumatized when Trump was elected it's not it's because Hillary lost it is because Hillary lost we didn't take into account what would happen if Hillary lost you know there's an article in The Daily Caller woman named Harmeet Dylan writes if President Hillary Clinton ran the country and Bill Clinton were the first gentlemen gentlemen would we be experiencing this cultural moment recognizing the problem of sexual harassment and with the 2017 Person of the Year Time magazine B those who spoke out about being harassed certainly not more likely Harvey Weinstein would be sipping Chardonnay in the Rose Garden and eating canapés while ugliness next victim while Bill Clinton did the exact same thing president Hillary Clinton would be smugly presiding over a brittle edifice of equality beneath which lurked decades of enabling shaming attacking suppressing and silencing the victims it's so true I mean we did not think about this we did not think about the fact that if Trump was elected the this backlash against people who abuse women you know because because even though I have said I have said that we should not let ourselves be ginned up and over excited by this and it's certainly unfair we have a smiley one of the worst hosts on television is now being attacked he's now been suspended from PBS for sexual harassment I was reading that story and of course with these sexual harassment things you never read past the headline you see Oh Tavis Smiley now sexual harassment multiple multiple victims multiple victims and then when you read it and not so much not so much you know people don't like him maybe he said some untoward things I don't think he should lose his job I think he should lose his job because he's lousy and because PBS hasn't got a single right wing spokesman on not one not even guests right wing guests come on their shows I mean they and this is a public station there's only one side relentlessly being pushed toward us the other so number four and I'll stop at number four even though I could go on number four way that people are getting the future wrong is simply misinformation and this is another bone I have to pick with these Trump skeptic right they keep saying hey the media is on the left you just have to accept it that is not right the media is producing a cloud of misinformation a recent poll said that 52% of Americans are now saying that the tax bill will raise their taxes even the left admits that almost everybody will get a tax cut almost everybody will get a tax cut they even now have cut taxes for higher earners in this final deal that's what sources say but just about everybody will get a tax cut and people don't know it and why because the left isn't going out of their way it's not that the left is spreading misinformation except through commentators it's that they're not going out of their way to correct the impression believe me believe me if this were Barack Obama's bill that's all you would be hearing no no no you silly fellow you're wrong it will cut your taxes consider let's take a look at this thing that's happening with the FBI I don't know how many of you been following this you know it is a they just released the text messages from 20 sixteen from Peter struck he's this guy who was leather zelich of these investigations he was in the Clinton email investigation he was demoted from Muller's team or Mueller's team or whatever it is for the look into Trump's Russia connections which are non-existent so these are text messages between Peter struck and the FBI lawyer Lisa page that he was having an affair with and that's that's the first thing I would like to know like why why did these guys have had so much time to commit adultery what they supposed to be investigating things doesn't investigating things take up your time like when were they doing when were they adulterating you know doing this stuff alright so these these emails are funny by the way if you read them read them in from my perspective and what it really looks like is that struck was kind of a moderate to liberal Republican and Lisa page was an ardent Democrat and to please her he keeps going further and further as the left and he keeps saying terrible terrible things about Donald Trump and he's saying eff Donald Trump and Donald Trump is an idiot I can't believe anybody would vote for Donald Trump so so the media and this is talking about misinformation the media is promoting those emails it's talking about those emails when I say the media I mean CNN I mean the network's they're promoting those emails and then they're saying what is quite true is that everybody has political opinions everybody can get a little rowdy and express their political opinions with dirty words never mind it doesn't mean he can't investigate properly they're not reporting on the network evening news they have completely blacked out the following emails okay these are texts I'm sorry not emails these are texts where struck says to Lisa page he says I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office okay and this is what's his name Andrew McCabe Andrew McCabe whose wife remember received all those it was a Democrat candidate for state Senate and I think Virginia and she received all these donations from the Clintons so he had that conflict of interest he says I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration and Andy's office that there's no way Trump gets elected but I'm afraid we can't take that risk it's like an insurance policy in the end likely event that you die before 40 now what is like that what is like what's the insurance he's saying that in this meeting at Andrew McCabe's office right he was the deputy FBI director Lisa Paige put forward a scenario that Trump could never get elected and he said I want to believe that I want to believe in that but I can't but we can't take that risk we need an insurance policy what was that this is the guy who rewrote through line in the investigation of Hillary Clinton instead of saying that she had committed a crime by being grossly negligent he said that she'd been extremely careless which is not a crime and he's the guy who made that rewrite okay in another exchange the same month page forwarded a trump related article and she wrote maybe you struck are meant to stay where you are because you're meant to protect the country from that menace and he says with kind of bravado of course I'll try and approach it that way you know I he says of course I'll try and approach it that way so what's he doing so here listen to Jim Jordan they had Rod Rosenstein from the Justice Department right and he's the guy because Jeff Sessions recused himself he's the guys in charge of the Russian investigation and Jim Jordan goes after Rod Rosenstein as he's been doing here's the guy in charge here's the guy picked Muller you're the guy who wrote the memo saying why he needed a fire Comey you're the guy in charge you could disband the Muller special prosecutor and you can do what we've all called for appointing a second special counsel to look into this to look into Peter struck Bruce or everything else we've learned in the last several weeks I don't have Toto's of that yes congressman and I can assure you that I considered very important to make sure the thorough review is done and our Inspector General is doing a thorough review that's how we found those text messages as part of that review let me use that you've given that answer like 15 times let me ask you this are you concerned I mean this is what a lot of Americans are believing right now and I certainly do that the Comey FBI and the Obama Justice Department worked with one campaign to go after the other campaign that's what everything points to think about what we've learned in the last several weeks we first learned they paid for the dossier then we learn about Peter struck and last week we learned about Bruce or and his wife Nellie I mean this is um so what's it going to take to get a second special counsel to answer these questions and find out was Peter struck really up to what I think he was I think it's important to understand congressman we have the inspector general has 500 employees and a hundred million dollar budget and that's what he does he investigates allegations of misconduct involving Department employees that review that he is conducting is what turned up those text messages it will also involve interviews of those persons and have other witnesses see see this is nonsense FBI answers to Congress the inspector general it's great that the Inspector General is doing an investigation but that's no reason for him the stonewall of congressmen that Congress the Congress or your elected officials sent there to go after these guys like Rosen's of people who are not elected to do oversight on them there's no excuse for saying no the Inspector General is investigating this so I can't speak to Congress that's absurd so all this misinformation and all this stonewalling also affects our view of the future and these are the ways in which when you're listening to people listen I don't know what's gonna happen in the midterms typically in a midterm there's a backlash against the party in power all I'm saying is this because people got Trump wrong they can't see how much Trump has gotten right they cannot see that this year from January to now if this especially if this tax plan passes has been the best year in government for conservatives everything else you hear everything else you hear women being molested you know so don't vote for this guy the true Trump colluding with Russia everything else is about that it's about power it we are watching a battle for power that's it right now for this year Trump has had the power and it has benefited us and that's where the morality of this lies that is where the moral question lies because it the conservative ethos is in fact a moral ethos that says that people should be free I keep saying this again and again freedom is the most moral the most important moral question because you can't behave morally unless you're free to make choices and the government smothers you in every possible way and even including you have to make a cake against your religious convictions then you're not free and you can't make those moral choices so don't be distracted by any of this stuff it's not about what it weather Trump's a nice guy it's not about whether Trump may be chased a girl I'm the girl around the room at one of his beauty pageants it's all about power and who has it and for the last year we've had it and it has worked out really really well all right let's bring on Kristian Toto my friend who from his blog is called Hollywood in toto and I so recommended if you're if you're interested in movies if you're interested in Hollywood you're reading all this stuff that is almost all of it coming from the left and unfortunately this is something I complain about all the time I complained to my friends at the magazines and my friends at the think tanks that when they cover culture they send out somebody who writes about politics they send somebody to a movie who writes about crime or writes about legislation who doesn't have the deep knowledge of movies or Hollywood or publishing whatever they're writing about to write the kind of stuff we need Christian todo has that knowledge Hollywood in toto is a terrific site it's really well written it's really exciting and it's from the right point of view of Christian there you are I can see you you do hey there D holidays thank you Merry Christmas as we say now it's a excellent pair of headsets why a pair of excellent anyway one of the biggest possible because I like to call them cans first of all let's well let's talk about to talk about the sex scandal because it's just getting bigger and bigger there was a piece did you see this piece in The New York Times about the Salma Hayek and Harvey Weinstein you know I thought I heard everything I could about this game though I thought I was as outraged as possible and is just chilled to the bone and then I read that and it all came back again and even worse and I think what's so amazing about that particular story about this particular actress is how it actually interrupted her art in addition to all the horrible things that he did to her that he tried to do to her how he made her feel terrible at every step of the way he tried to screw over her artistic dream and that in a sense flies in the face of this whole Harvey Einstein's a patron of the Arts he's a wonderful entertainer he wants to bring the independent sensibility to film no he's just a monster and he's a monster through every possible level of Hollywood and what he did to Salma Hayek and how she persevered is amazing in fact I think it'd be a movie itself I think you could do a movie about this entire situation with heroes and villains and drama and everything there it is unbelievable and and good for sama high for prey for phrasing it and such an a matte magical powerful way you know it's a compelling read it really is a good read in Salma Hayek I mean I you know she's really talented actress and obviously an incredibly beautiful woman she's also a far I mean she was talking mostly about this picture of Frida which is about the socialist artist and and she's praised Che Guevara I mean it's very hard but you cannot help feeling sympathy for Frida is actually a good movie it really is and there's one scene in this article where Harvey Weinstein basically says I'll cut off this movie unless you do a nude lesbian sex scene in the movie I mean it made it really it made my throat close or what I you know that is what that that's what women or any artist is dealing with in Hollywood is pretty shocking now you wrote a piece recently and you get you decorators I happen to notice it because you decorated with one of my videos which I appreciate it but you wrote a piece about Lena Dunham in these sex scandals I'm gonna let you tell it I mean how she has basically debased herself during these scandals yeah you know there's a lot of things to say about Lena Dunham in almost none good but this particular story was revealed by the New York Times when they were investigating how Weinstein was able to get away with everything he got away with and it mentions how Lena Dunham reached out to the Hillary campaign in 2016 not once but twice and said hey guys and gals you got to get away from this guy he's a rapist he's a horrible human being and if the campaign is connected to him and he falls or it's revealed that it's gonna really stain the effort to make Hillary the first female president she did it twice she knew like many many people in Hollywood and guess who she didn't tell anybody else no one she left Harvey Weinstein to do all the things that he was doing and didn't blow the whistle now it's a little complicated because women like Salma Hayek who are directly input influenced by Weinstein who were assaulted who were attacked who were seduced in the grossest way possible or it's a bad word phrase way of saying it but I understand when they're quiet because they've been hiked illogically winded they've been attacked they worry about their careers you know Lena Dunham wasn't that person she wasn't attacked she just knew so she could have rallied people on her side she could have called the press and said hey I've got the dirt on this guy can you start investigating this so he will never hurt another young starlet who comes to Hollywood with dreams of being a superstar she didn't do it she cared about what's Hillary Clinton she really has seemed to be circling the drain Lena Dunham and I son I sometimes wonder if she got sucked in you know they kept calling her a star while no one was watching her show and I wonder if when the show went off and she suddenly was back in reality where nobody cared who she was and she had no influence I wonder if it's kind of making her a little crazy now is is this is this a sea change is this gonna change anything out here I mean I know I laugh because my agents and other agents that I know are scrambling around their reaction to the sex scandal is to scoop up the talent that is now free because agents are getting fired for pinching butts you know but is this do you think things will change in Hollywood it's been like this forever well you know I think it's gonna be unclear there's two factors going on one you do have to get more women behind the scenes in powerful positions because that will make this happen less and less now I don't want quotas I don't wanna say hey we have 250 fifty percent of people who are women and men I think that's the wrong approach but there has to be a genuine ability to say we need to hire the best person whether it's a male or a female whether he or she is untested or has a long resume you have to get those new voices in there but more specifically it's the culture now look at Salma Hayek here's this beautiful talented actress who had a long resume when she made that movie Freda she didn't feel that this she had any warriors on her saw and who would stand up for her who would defend her who would fight for her nobody now why she suffered in silence and until she gets those warriors I don't know how much changes in the industry I do think that people will be more and more leery of doing the bad behavior because they know they may get caught where someone will spread the word about it but overall until these different things happen I don't see significant change it could be a blip and I hope that this causes that change but a lot more has to happen beyond the fact that names are being named not yes it is interesting and as as these people go out and new people come in I think the memory will of all this will disappear it does I think it does speak to the bubble effect of just being around people who agree with you Lena Dunham could keep silent because Hillary Clinton was so important and everybody thought that everybody in Hollywood thought that you know Hillary Clinton was more important than exposing Harvey Weinstein and Harvey Weinstein was a big donor let's talk about the year in movies the Golden Globes have come out I first my first question is D when you look it back I mean you see more movies than I do but when you look back at the year in pictures do you see any sign whatsoever that Hollywood has taken on board the fact that there are at least 60 million in the cut people in the country who disagree with them are they servicing Trump voters at all or is it just resistance resistance resistance well I think it's too soon to know from a Content point of view because it takes so long for these movies that made get approved get shot get marketed get released I think that's gonna be kind of a wait-and-see I think the real fascinating question and I want to tune in just to see it because often the Oscar telecast is absolutely boring and dreadful will they go the full resistance on Oscar night and a time when their industry has suffered black eye after black eye after a black eye where we all know that they all knew about Weinstein and his companions and compatriots and did nothing can they have the hubris to go out there and make some speeches for the DNC while all of that is still in our memory that's the million-dollar question now you got Jimmy Kimmel will be the host he's an ardent leftist he's gonna come on very very dramatically in recent ways you know holding up a baby or hoppy or something you know if they were true comedians out there they would mock him into the into oblivion no offense to his film child but bringing a child up and holding him into the camera to make your point it just seems like that the horrea stuff cliches yeah but that will be the real thing so now it's it's still a couple of months away we still have time for the the culture to evolve and change and shape and grow but will they make this another event where it's all about their political point of views and less and less about the movies that god I hope that that will be really interesting I can I can't say I don't want to say who was because it was a personal conversation but I have that my Christmas party recently and there was a very successful actor there and he had been at an award show and before they went on he said to me that they told them no politics let's not talk politics oh maybe it would be interesting if we see some more of that because people turn it off so what do you what did you make of the gold go let me put it to you this way what what did you make of the Golden Globes and what do you think are the pictures of the year well you know I years ago and I didn't mean many years ago we just kind of shrugged at the Golden Globe nominations it was a bit of a tainted organization some weird films were nominated never what's that the tourists with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp it was a Johnny to have three Angelina Jolie movie that no one saw no one cared no one liked but it got some nominations because they wanted to get those stars in the in the the theatre that night so I don't think much about the event and I think we keep trying to give more importance to certain things that don't deserve it hmm much like there's about 16 different awards leading up to the Oscars they're not all super important guys in calendars doesn't matter right more specifically my movie of the year wasn't even nominated by anything it's getting no buzz it's called thank you for your service it's a great film okay soldiers coming home from Iraq and all the things that they're going through miles teller is a star he is sensational the movie sensational and it's from the writer who gave us American sniper Oh even directed the film and it is mesmerizing and it's also rather excoriating when it comes to the VA and the the government bureaucracy when it comes to health care so but it's not very political it's more about their lives and about their heroism and about what they face here a beautiful powerful film it made no money it got no significant critical buzz and it's my best movie of the year you know that's funny because as you mentioned it I thought oh yeah you know it's funny now that you've mentioned it I heard some good things about I realized as you were talking I read it on your blog on Hollywood and Toto that's that explains it but that that is really interesting I will watch it I haven't I'm embarrassed what I'm running out of time but what's what's a what are you looking forward to in the in the next year anything you know just more great television frankly I I don't know what to really look forward to in the movies I think the whole sequel and remake and reboot that process goes you know unchanged I don't think it's gonna really change at all until enough blockbusters are absolute duds having said that you know the Black Panther film looks engaging I feel like Marvel superhero films are smart and funny and interesting and perfectly cast and I don't think that's gonna be anything different the one movie I'm really excited about is 1517 to Paris it's the Clint Eastwood movie about the three heroes who thwarted that terrorist attack it's coming out February 9th the trailer just dropped this week it looks excellent and he cast the real heroes in those roles Wow and that's a really daring move and I don't know if it's gonna pay off but if anyone can do it it's the 80-something Clint Eastwood all right Christian toto that blog is called Hollywood in toto right tio tio and and also you're on Twitter what's your Twitter handle at Hollywood in toda I glad that's that sounds good I cannot gonna remember I keep the brain cancer Oh Krishna is good to see if I don't see you before Christmas have a Merry Christmas and I'll talk to you next year all right I'm running out of time but I want to do stuff I like so CNN ran a piece that really belongs in the onion 26 year olds face challenges as they fall off parents health insurance 26 year olds falling off mommy and daddy's health insurance are facing troubles let me just read you the opening of this piece all right Margarete money Oh felt frustrated and flummoxed despite the many hours she had spent in front of the computer this year reading consumer reviews of health insurance plans offered on the individual market in Virginia she still did not know what plan was right for her now if you have tears prepare to shed them now Monni oat was preparing to buy an insurance policy of her own knowing she would aged out of her parents plan when she turned 26 in October she asked her parents for help and advice but they too ran into trouble trying to decipher which policy would work best for their daughter the family had relied on her father's employer-sponsored plan through his work as an architect for years so no one had spent much time sifting through policies honestly my parents were just as confused as I was said mommy Oh a restaurant server in Roanoke I want to end it today with my favorite non-religious Christmas song which is have yourself a merry little Christmas Sam Smith has a wonderful new rendition of it but I want to play the original one which is by Judy Garland because no one has ever done it better and it's from the movie meet me in st. Louis which came out in 1944 the when they originally handed in the lyrics to this these stars and the director looked at it and they thought it was just too dark and they there was actually a line have yourself a merry little Christmas it may be our last next year we may all be living in the past why was it such a dark song and why was it such a big hit and it's because it was 1944 in 1944 26 year olds were not trying to find a new policy because they fell off mom and dad's policies they were fighting their way people's brothers their sons and their husbands were fighting their way through Europe at the Battle of the Bulge and Christmas of 1944 and so if you are a 26 year old and you're complaining because you fell off mom and dad's insurance here's what you do this will help you a lot go in in the bathroom look in the mirror and slap yourself in the face so hard that your eyeballs roll in two different directions because you're a hunk so as you listen to this absolute I mean Julia Norwood one of the great voices of all time as you listen to this rendition picture yourself in this situation where you or your husband or your brother or your son is off fighting the Battle of the Bulge one of the toughest Hitler's last attempt to take over the world and this is the song for that Christmas the I'm Andrew Clavin merry little Christmas let your heart beat next year our troubles will be hard Oh merry little Christmas make the Yuletide gay next year our troubles will be miles away we'll be near to the Andrew Clavin show is produced by Robert Sterling executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our supervising producer is Mathis Glover technical producer Austin Stevens edited by Alex zingaro audio is mixed by Mike kameena hair and makeup is by Joshua Albuera and our animations are by Cynthia Angulo and Jacob Jackson the Andrew Clavin show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright for word publishing
