00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:03,530
THE SUPREME COURT HAS REALLY 

40
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,632
DELIVERED HIM A MAJOR VICTORY, 

41
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:08,735
SAYING THAT HIS THIRD ATTEMPT 

42
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,136
TO PASS A TRAVEL BAN FINALLY 

43
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:10,703
WOULD PASS CONSTITUTIONAL 

44
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:10,970
SCRUTINY. 

45
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,705
NOW, I DON'T THINK THIS 

46
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,506
DECISION WAS A SURPRISE. 

47
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,808
THE SUPREME COURT BACK IN 

48
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,109
DECEMBER ALLOWED THE TRAVEL BAN 

49
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,011
TO TAKE EFFECT WHILE THE

51
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,615
WHICH WAS A SIGNAL THAT THEY 

52
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,617
WERE PROBABLY GOING TO UPHOLD 

53
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:25,819
IT TODAY. 

54
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:26,552
TRUMP PASSED THIS TRAVEL BAN 

55
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:27,353
BACK IN SEPTEMBER. 

56
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:30,056
IT WAS HIS -- AS I SAID, HIS 

57
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:30,423
THIRD ATTEMPT. 

58
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,958
THE FIRST TWO WERE BLOCKED 

59
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,359
ALMOST COMPLETELY BY THE LOWER 

60
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,194
COURTS, HE HAD LOST AT ALMOST 

61
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:35,528
EVERY TURN. 

62
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,230
AND SO TODAY THE SUPREME COURT 

63
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,431
SAID THAT THE THIRD TIME WAS A 

64
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,068
CHARM, THAT HE HAD FINALLY 

65
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:42,468
GOTTEN IT RIGHT. 

66
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:44,604
THE PRESIDENTS WERE ENTITLED TO 

67
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,672
DEFERENCE ON THESE KINDS OF 

68
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,107
QUESTIONS ON NATIONAL SECURITY 

69
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,041
AND PROTECTING OUR BORDERS 

70
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,243
HERE, AND THAT THIS BAN PASSED 

71
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:54,314
THAT KIND OF MUSTER AND THAT 

72
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:54,681
KIND OF REVIEW. 

73
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,516
THERE WERE FOUR DISSENTING 

74
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,717
JUSTICES, THE LIBERAL JUSTICES 

75
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:58,918
WROTE VERY SHARP DISSENTS 

76
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,054
SAYING THE COURT HAD REALLY 

77
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:01,954
FAILED TO CONSIDER THE 

78
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,056
DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT ON 

79
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,757
MUSLIMS, THAT THIS WAS IN FACT 

80
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,324
A MUSLIM BAN, BUT THE 

81
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:06,459
ADMINISTRATION HAD ALWAYS SAID 

82
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,163
IT WAS NOT A MUSLIM BAN, THEY 

83
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:10,964
ARGUED THIS WHEN THE SUPREME 

84
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,065
COURT HEARD ARGUMENTS IN THE 

85
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,066
CASE LAST MONTH, OR BACK IN 

86
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,867
APRIL THAT THIS WAS NOT A 

87
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:15,167
MUSLIM BAN. 

88
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,369
IT WAS FIVE MOSTLY MUSLIM 

89
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,937
COUNTRIES AT THIS POINT, IT 

90
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,571
EXCLUDED THE VAST MAJORITY OF 

91
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:20,840
THE MUSLIM WORLD. 

92
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,941
AND TODAY THE SUPREME COURT IN 

93
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,010
THIS 5-4 DECISION AGREED THAT 

94
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,014
THIS WAS A LEGITIMATE AND 

95
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:28,748
REASONABLE EXERCISE OF THE 

96
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,248

WE HAVE TO BE TOUGH, AND WE 

140
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:32,045
HAVE TO BE SAFE, AND WE HAVE TO 

141
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,345
BE SECURE. 

142
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,414
AT A MINIMUM WE HAVE TO MAKE 

143
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,016
SURE THAT WE VET PEOPLE COMING 

144
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:37,783
INTO THE COUNTRY. 

145
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:41,654
WE KNOW WHO'S COMING IN, WE 

146
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:42,655
KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM. 

147
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,957
YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW WHO'S 

148
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:45,290
COMING HERE. 

149
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,060
THE RULING SHOWS THAT ALL OF 

150
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,262
THE ATTACKS FROM THE MEDIA AND 

151
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,364
THE DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS ARE 

152
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,266
WRONG, AND THEY TURNED OUT TO 

153
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:53,999
BE VERY WRONG. 

154
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,468
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AS 

155
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,538
REPUBLICANS I CAN TELL YOU IS 

156
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,139
STRONG BORDERS, NO CRIME. 

157
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,208
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING 

158
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,845
AT IS OPEN BORDERS WHICH WILL 

159
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:06,746
BRING TREMENDOUS CRIME. 

160
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,747
IT'LL BRING MS-13 AND LOTS OF 

161
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,683
OTHERS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO 

162
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,483
HAVE IN OUR COUNTRY. 

163
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:12,584
IT'LL BRING TREMENDOUS CRIME. 

164
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,287
SO I WILL ALWAYS BE DEFENDING 

165
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:18,358
THE SOVEREIGNTY, THE SAFETY AND 

166
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,026
THE SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN 

167
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:20,259
PEOPLE. 

168
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,127
THAT'S WHY I WAS PUT HERE. 

169
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:23,863
WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY THE 

170
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:27,567
FUNDING OF THE WALL WHICH WE 

171
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:27,967
VERY MUCH NEED. 

172
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:28,434
WE STARTED THE WALL. 

173
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,470
WE'RE SPEND AGO LOT OF ENERGY 

174
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,538
AND A LOT OF TIME AND STARTED 

175
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,641
UP IN SAN DIEGO AND OTHER 

176
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:36,142
PLACES. 

177
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:36,776
IT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION NOW. 

178
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,509
WE HAVE $1.6 BILLION. 

179
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,146
BUT WE'RE GOING TO ASK FOR AN 

180
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,249
INCREASE IN WALL SPENDING SO WE 

181
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,182
CAN FINISH IT QUICKER. 

182
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:46,452
IT STOPS THE DRUGS, IT STOPS 

183
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,255
PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO 

184
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,424
HAVE, AND IT GIVES US SECURITY 

185
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:52,758
AND SAFETY. 

186
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:54,360
AND WITH THAT, IF YOU -- I 

187
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,762
THINK WE MIGHT JUST TAKE A 

188
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,464
QUICK SPIN AROUND THE ROOM, 

189
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,867
TALK TO A COUPLE OF THE FOLKS 

190
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:01,834
AND MAYBE, SENATOR, I'LL ASK 

191
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,369
YOU, DO YOU WANT TO SAY A 

192
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,237
COUPLE OF WORDS ABOUT WHY WE'RE 

193
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:06,439
HERE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING? 

194
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,809
>> WELL, I THINK WITH THE 

195
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,544
LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN FREELAND 

196
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,145
HSEN AND CHAIRMAN SHELBY, WE'RE 

197
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:13,746
ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET THESE 

198
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,346
APPROPRIATIONS BILLS TO THE 

199
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:17,717
FLOOR AND GET THEM ON YOUR DESK 

200
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:18,918
AS YOU'VE INSISTED, NOT IN AN 

201
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:19,185
OMNIBUS. 

202
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,754
I THINK THE LAST TIME WE HAD A 

203
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:22,654
CONFERENCE REPORT ON THE SENATE 

204
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:25,758
FLOOR, THIS WOULD BE WHERE THE 

205
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,059
HOUSE PASSED A BILL AND WE 

206
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:29,929
DIDN'T, WE DIDN'T -- IT WAS 

207
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:30,396
2011. 

208
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,465
SO WE JUST PASSED THE FIRST 

209
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,866
THREE BILLS YESTERDAY THAT THE 

210
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,568
HOUSE HAD ALREADY PASSED AND 

211
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,169
WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO TRY TO 

212
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,106
GET BACK INTO BUSINESS IN A 

213
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,442
TRANSPARENT WAY SO THAT PEOPLE 

214
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,244
CAN SEE WHAT THEIR GOVERNMENT 

215
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:45,511
IS DOING. 

216
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:45,777
>> YES. 

217
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:48,915
>> WE'RE IN THE FIRST QUARTER 

218
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:49,549
OF THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS. 

219
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,651
WE WANT TO USE THE -- IF YOU 

220
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,653
WANT TO USE THE FOOTBALL 

221
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:53,920
ANALOGY. 

222
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,755
WE'RE DOING WELL RIGHT NOW. 

223
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:56,255
WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER. 

224
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,457
>> WE'RE JUST LISTENING IN TO 

225
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:01,194
THE PRESIDENT DISCUSS WHAT HE 

226
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,462
CALLS A TREMENDOUS VICTORY IN 

227
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,663
THE SUPREME COURT, THE SUPREME 

228
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,697
COURT JUSTICES SUPPORTING HIS 

229
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,264
TRAVEL BAN. 

230
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,766
WE WANT TO BRING IN JORDAN 

231
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,569
FABIAN, A WHITE HOUSE 

232
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,669
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE HILL. 

233
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,139
JORDAN, THE PRESIDENT CALLED 

234
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:13,806
THIS DECISION VINDICATION. 

235
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,341
BUT THIS WAS THE THIRD DRAFT OF 

236
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,041
HIS TRAVEL BAN. 

237
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,343
THE FIRST TWO, OF COURSE, AS WE 

238
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,711
ALL REMEMBER FROM THE PROTESTS 

239
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,645
DIDN'T GO SO WELL. 

240
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:23,616
SO WOULD YOU REALLY CALL THIS A 

241
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,517
DECISIVE VICTORY FOR THE 

242
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:24,884
ADMINISTRATION? 

243
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,652
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S A VICTORY 

244
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,655
IN THE SENSE NOW THEY CAN CARRY 

245
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,657
OUT THIS POLICY, AND WITH THAT 

246
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,157
STATEMENT -- WHAT THAT 

247
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:33,159
STATEMENT VINDICATION INDICATES 

248
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,761
IS THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

249
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,128
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED WITH THE 

250
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:38,164
LEGAL SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN 

251
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,565
IT COMES TO THE IMMIGRATION 

252
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,566
ISSUE. 

253
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,834
HE EXPRESSED THAT FRUSTRATION 

254
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,069
TIME AND TIME AGAIN AS WE HEARD 

255
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,037
AFTER THE SUPREME COURT -- 

256
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,139
EXCUSE ME, LOWER COURTS STRUCK 

257
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,641
DOWN THAT ORIGINAL TRAVEL BAN. 

258
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,142
FOR MONTHS WE'VE HEARD HIM RAIL 

259
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:52,211
AGAINST HOW THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS 

260
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:52,811
HOLDING HIS IMMIGRATION BACK. 

261
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:55,047
NOW THE SUPREME COURT HAS GIVEN 

262
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,449
HIM THE GO AHEAD TO IMPLEMENT 

263
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,453
THIS TRAVEL BAN WHICH IS REALLY 

264
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:00,953
THE CENTERPIECE OF HIS 

265
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:01,654
IMMIGRATION AGENDA. 

266
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:05,958
SO INDEED A VICTORY TODAY FOR 

267
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,325
THE PRESIDENT. 

268
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,461
>> THE FIRST WAS MET WITH 

269
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,862
MASSIVE PROTESTS AND CONFUSION 

270
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,163
OVER HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT. 

271
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:13,065
WHAT DOES THIS DECISION SAY 

272
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:17,369
ABOUT HOW THE ADMINISTRATION 

273
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,437
CAN SUCCESSFULLY MOVE FORWARD 

274
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:18,770
ON POLICY? 

275
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,940
>> WELL, I THINK THE SIGNAL THE 

276
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,542
COURT IS SENDING IS THE 

277
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,810
ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO BE MORE 

278
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,243
CAREFUL. 

279
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,344
THE REASON THAT FIRST ORDER WAS 

280
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,712
STRUCK DOWN IS IT DIDN'T REALLY 

281
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,548
GO THROUGH ANY KIND OF PROCESS 

282
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,616
AND IT WAS OVERLY BROAD, AND 

283
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,551
THE COURTS RESPONDED BY 

284
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,452
STRIKING IT DOWN BEFORE IT 

285
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,787
COULD GO UNDER LEGAL REVIEW. 

286
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,556
THEY WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING 

287
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,692
BOARD, THEY CRAFTED SOMETHING 

288
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:40,326
THAT INCLUDES SOME CARVEOUTS, 

289
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,394
INCLUDES SOME EXCEPTIONS, 

290
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,061
INCLUDED COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH 

291
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:42,895
KOREA THAT'S NOT PREDOMINANTLY 

292
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,764
MUSLIM SO THEY COULD TRY TO 

293
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,565
CLAIM THAT IT'S NOT REALLY A 

294
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:45,865
MUSLIM BAN. 

295
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,701
SO THAT MIGHT BE A SIGN TO THIS 

296
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,737
ADMINISTRATION GOING FORWARD TO 

297
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:52,137
BE MORE CAREFUL. 

298
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,139
II MEAN, LOOK AT THE FAMILY -- 

299
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,941
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE FAMILY 

300
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,442
SEPARATION POLICY THAT'S GOING 

301
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:56,675
ON NOW. 

302
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:58,010
THEY ARE HAVING SOME ISSUES 

303
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,343
WITH THAT. 

304
00:07:58,343 --> 00:07:59,412
THAT WAS ANOTHER HASTEILY 

305
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,446
DRAFTED ORDER THEY CAME OUT 

306
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,448
WITH, AND, AGAIN, IT MIGHT BE A 

307
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,216
CLUE TO THE DECISION MAKERS TO 

308
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:05,017
BE A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL. 

309
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,686
>> TO PLAN OUT THESE POLICIES 

310
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,354
WITH MORE DETAIL SO THAT THEY 

311
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,555
DON'T END UP BEING OPPOSED BY 

312
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,756
THE COURTS, END UP GETTING TO 

313
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:11,957
THE SUPREME COURT AND GOING 

314
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:13,024
THROUGH THIS LONG PROCESS. 

315
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:14,260
NOW, IN TERMS OF THE 

316
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,261
PRESIDENT'S REMARKS TODAY, HE 

317
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,264
SAID THAT WHAT HE IS PUSHING 

318
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,232
FOR IS STRONG BORDERS, NO 

319
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:21,667
CRIME, AND DEMOCRATS WANT OPEN 

320
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,070
BORDERS AND TREMENDOUS CRIME. 

321
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,105
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THAT 

322
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:26,438
ASKERTATION? 

323
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:28,674
>> WELL, I THINK WHAT WE'RE 

324
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,109
SEEING IS THE PRESIDENT 

325
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,143
EMBOLDENED BY THIS COURT 

326
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:31,877
RULING, EVEN THOUGH, AGAIN, HE 

327
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:33,613
HAD THESE LEGAL PROBLEMS IN THE 

328
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:33,846
PAST. 

329
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,147
THE PRESIDENT IS PUSHING 

330
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,049
FORWARD ON TWO THINGS RIGHT 

331
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,751
NOW, THE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY 

332
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,885
WHICH HAS SULTED IN THESE 

333
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:40,419
CHILD SEPARATIONS. 

334
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,754
YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF HE'S 

335
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,722
GOING TO BE MORE STRONGLY 

336
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:44,790
PUSHING THAT GOING FORWARD 

337
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,357
AFTER ASSIGNING -- AFTER 

338
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:46,158
SIGNING THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER 

339
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,660
LAST WEEK TO STOP SOME OF THE 

340
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,861
SEPARATION, AND ALSO FUNDING 

341
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,596
FOR HIS BORDER WALL. 

342
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,632
THIS IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR 

343
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,066
FUNDING FIGHT WHEN THE 

344
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,568
GOVERNMENT FUNDING RUNS OUT IN 

345
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:55,868
SEPTEMBER. 

346
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,569
THE PRESIDENT HAS DEMANDED 

347
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,537
FUNDING BE IN THAT PACKAGE OR 

348
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:00,740
ELSE HE THREATENED THAT HE 

349
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,373
MIGHT SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. 

350
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:02,341
SO THE PRESIDENT NOW SEEING 

351
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,943
THAT THE COURT IS ON HIS SIDE 

352
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,745
ON ONE KEY IMMIGRATION ISSUE, 

353
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,446
VU TO WONDER IF HE'S GOING TO 

354
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,447
PUSH FORWARD EVEN MORE STRONGLY 

355
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,450
ON OTHER ELEMENTS OF THAT IN 

356
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,318
THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD. 

357
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,054
>> ON IMMIGRATION, THE HEALTH 

358
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,656
AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY 

359
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,257
SAYS HIS DEPARTMENT STILL HAS 

360
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,157
MORE THAN 2,000 IMMIGRANT 

361
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:20,459
CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM THEIR 

362
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,127
PARENTS IN THEIR CUSTODY. 

363
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,296
THAT'S AS A RESULT OF THE ZERO 

364
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:23,696
TOLERANCE POLICY. 

365
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,064
SO WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION 

366
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:29,468
SAYING ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING 

367
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,037
TO REUNITE THEM AS OF NOW? 

368
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,638
>> THERE'S STILL LACK OF 

369
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,739
CLARITY OVER HOW THESE 

370
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,507
REUNIFICATIONS ARE TAKING 

371
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:34,740
PLACE. 

372
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,042
WE KNOW FOR SOME OF THEM 

373
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,343
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEIR 

374
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,111
PARENTS, BUT WE'VE HEARD MANY 

375
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,413
CASES FROM THE BORDER WHERE 

376
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,048
CHILDREN ARE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY 

377
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,215
AND THE RECORDS DON'T INDICATE 

378
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,551
WHO THEIR PARENTS ARE, BUT IF 

379
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,086
THEY DO, MAYBE NOT WHERE THEY 

380
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,187
ARE. 

381
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,689
SO THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS 

382
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:52,658
RIGHT NOW LOGISTICALLY TRYING 

383
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:53,225
TO REUNITE THESE PARENTS. 

384
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,060
AND THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T 

385
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,760
REALLY PUT FORWARD ANY KIND OF 

386
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,064
POLICY OR PUSH TO REUNITE THESE 

387
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:58,331
CHILDREN. 

388
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:58,998
SO WHILE THIS ISSUE IS SORT OF 

389
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,299
-- HAS SORT OF FADED INTO THE 

390
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,901
BACKGROUND WITH THE SUPREME 

391
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:02,535
COURT DECISION NOW COMING DOWN 

392
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,769
ON THE TRAVEL BAN, IT'S STILL 

393
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,738
GOING TO BE A MAJOR CHALLENGE 

394
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:06,939
FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION TO FIX 

395
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,706
THE MESS IT CREATED. 

396
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:10,242
>> HOW DO YOU THINK THAT THE 

397
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,645
SUPREME COURT'S DECISION ON THE 

398
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,046
TRAVEL BAN WILL AFFECT THE 

399
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,047
POLICY ON IMMIGRATION, WHAT 

400
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:19,351
KIND OF PRESSURE OR SIGNAL DOES 

401
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:20,919
THAT GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION? 

402
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,755
>> WELL, THE MAJORITY OF 

403
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:23,489
CONCERN OF THE JUSTICES HANDED 

404
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,891
THIS PRESIDENT A MAJOR VICTORY 

405
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,693
WHEN IT SAID THE PRESIDENT HAS 

406
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:28,760
WIDE LATITUDE UNDER EXECUTIVE 

407
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,297
POWER TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION 

408
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:31,497
LAW. 

409
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,566
SO THIS HAS BEEN A CENTRAL 

410
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,370
ARGUMENT OF THE PRESIDENT'S úHA 

411
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,038
THE POWER TO DO THINGS LIKE 

412
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,439
SPLIT UP FAMILIES, BAN PEOPLE 

413
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,741
FROM CERTAIN MUSLIM MAJORITY 

414
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,242
CURRENTS AND THE COURT SAID HE 

415
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,544
DOES -- COUNTRIES AND THE COURT 

416
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,245
SAID HE DOES. 

417
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,813
SO THAT BROAD STATEMENT FROM 

418
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,850
THE COURT COULD EMBOLDEN THE 

419
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,450
PRESIDENT TO TAKE EVEN MORE 

420
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:51,951
AGGRESSIVE ACTION GOING 

421
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:52,218
FORWARD. 

422
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,954
>> JORDAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH 

423
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,589
FOR THOSE INSIGHTS. 

424
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,290
>>>  LET'S TURN NOW TO OUR 

425
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:58,723
CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL 

426
00:10:58,723 --> 00:10:59,892
CORRESPONDENT NANCY CORDES 

427
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,360
WHO'S ON THE HILL FOR US. 

428
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,828
NANCY, HOW ARE YOU DOING? 

429
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,498
>>REPORTER:  I'M DOING GREAT. 

430
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:07,566
GOOD TO TALK TO YOU, AIANA. 

431
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,068
>> GOOD TO TALK TO YOU TOO. 

432
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,069
WHAT'S BEEN THE REACTION FROM 

433
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,737
LAWMAKERS ON THE SUPREME COURT 

434
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:12,238
RULING ? 

435
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,140
>>REPORTER:  IT'S BEEN COMING 

436
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,641
DOWN PREDICTABLY ALONG PARTY 

437
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,208
LINES, DEMOCRATS OUTRAGED. 

438
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:21,547
THEY ARE SAYING THAT THIS IS A 

439
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,083
VICTORY FOR THOSE WHO WOULD 

440
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:24,683
DISCRIMINATE ON RACIAL AND 

441
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,117
RELIGIOUS GROUNDS. 

442
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,385
CHUCK SCHUMER, THE LEADER OF 

443
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,187
THE DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE 

444
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,789
SAID THIS RULING DOESN'T MAKE 

445
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,056
US SAFER. 

446
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,091
THE TRAVEL BAN DOESN'T MAKE US 

447
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,660
SAFER, AND THE RULING DOESN'T 

448
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,928
MAKE IT RIGHT. 

449
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,497
REPUBLICANS, ON THE OTHER HAND, 

450
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,566
SAID, HEY, LOOK, THREE TIMES IS 

451
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:40,832
A CHARM. 

452
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:42,968
THE TRAVEL BAN THAT WENT BEFORE 

453
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,336
THE SUPREME COURT WAS WITHIN 

454
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,170
THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW. 

455
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,438
OBVIOUSLY THE JUSTICE 

456
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:48,274
DEPARTMENT HAD TO TWEAK IT TO 

457
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,476
GET IT THERE, BUT THEY ARGUE 

458
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,244
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD A RIGHT 

459
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,679
TO DO WHAT HE FELT WOULD KEEP 

460
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,280
THE COUNTRY SAFE. 

461
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,482
AND THERE'S EVEN A LITTLE BIT 

462
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,685
OF GLOATING GOING ON FROM THE 

463
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:00,686
REPUBLICAN LEADER OF THE 

464
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:01,219
SENATE, MITCH McCONNELL. 

465
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:01,820
IT WAS MCCONNELL, OF COURSE, 

466
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,391
WHO HELD UP NOT JUST A A VOTE, 

467
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,725
-- NOT JUST A VOTE, BUT A 

468
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,594
HEARING ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 

469
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,663
PICK FOR SUPREME COURT FOR 

470
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,998
NEARLY A YEAR, MERRICK GARLAND, 

471
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:17,770
AND SO TODAY AFTER THAT RULING 

472
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,038
CAME DOWN, HIS CAMPAIGN FUND, 

473
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,074
TMITCH TWEETED OUT A PHOTO OF 

474
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,676
MCCONNELL SHAKING GARLAND'S 

475
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:24,777
HAND -- GORSUCH'S HAND, RATHER. 

476
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,178
NO CAPTION, BUT SIMPLY A 

477
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,479
REMINDER THAT IT IS THANKS TO 

478
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:33,185
MCCONNELL IN LARGE PART THAT WE 

479
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:36,621
SAW THIS 5-4 RULING TODAY. 

480
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:40,659
WE'VE SEEN A LITTLE BIT FROM A 

481
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,894
SMALL SLIVER OF REPUBLICANS, 

482
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,796
ADRIANA, WHO SAY THAT, YOU 

483
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,063
KNOW, THAT THOUGH THE 

484
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:45,731
ADMINISTRATION WAS FINALLY ABLE 

485
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,501
TO GET THIS PASSED THROUGH THE 

486
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,602
SUPREME COURT, THAT THE 

487
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,502
PRESIDENT'S INTENT CLEARLY 

488
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:51,871
DIFFERED FROM THE FINAL 

489
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,239
PRODUCT, THAT HE HAD MADE 

490
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,874
MULTIPLE STATEMENTS INDICATING 

491
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,976
THAT HE WANTED TO KEEP MUSLIMS 

492
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,144
OUT OF THIS COUNTRY, BUT BY AND 

493
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:00,880
LARGE YOU'RE HEARING AT LEAST 

494
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,882
OFFICIALLY A LOT OF RELIEF FROM 

495
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,583
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TODAY 

496
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,919
>> NANCY, WE HEARD FROM SENATOR 

497
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,488
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL EARLIER 

498
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:09,721
TODAY. 

499
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:10,689
LET'S PLAY SOME OF HIS 

500
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:11,056
RESPONSE. 

501
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,960
>> CLEARLY THIS OPINION IS BY 

502
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,729
NO MEANS THE END OF THIS STORY. 

503
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:18,563
IT IS NO SOLUTION. 

504
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:20,966
THERE IS NO QUESTION THERE HAS 

505
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,568
TO BE LEGISLATION TO PROTECT 

506
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,702
OUR ESSENTIAL LIBERTIES, OUR 

507
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,970
IMAGE AROUND THE WORLD WHICH IS 

508
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,374
VERY MUCH AT RISK AND AT STAKE 

509
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:28,641
HERE. 

510
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,477
THE CONGRESS NOW HAS WORK TO 

511
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:31,877
DO. 

512
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,379
IT CANNOT SIMPLY ALLOW THE 

513
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,047
COURTS TO DETERMINE -- OR THE 

514
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,683
PRESIDENT WHAT OUR FUTURE IS IN 

515
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,450
THIS AREA. 

516
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,386
THERE NOW NEEDS TO BE 

517
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:40,719
LEGISLATION. 

518
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,087
>> SO, NANCY, THE SENATOR IS 

519
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:42,788
SUGGESTING CONGRESS WILL NEED 

520
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:46,559
TO GET INVOLVED, BUT HOW MUCH 

521
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,793
CAN THEY CHANGE THIS AND HOW 

522
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,261
REALISTIC WOULD THAT BE? 

523
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:51,497
>>REPORTER:  AS OF RIGHT NOW, 

524
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,498
ADRIANA, THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO 

525
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,099
BE A HUGE APPETITE TO CHANGE 

526
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,102
THE LAW IN THIS AREA OR IN THE 

527
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:57,970
AREA OF GERRYMANDERING WHICH IS 

528
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,471
SOMETHING ELSE THAT CAME UP -- 

529
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,074
THAT THE SUPREME COURT RULED ON 

530
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,275
EARLIER THIS WEEK. 

531
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:08,380
AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS 

532
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,548
UNLIKELY WITH CONGRESS UNABLE 

533
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,016
EVEN TO PASS A COMPREHENSIVE 

534
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,384
IMMIGRATION REFORM PLAN THAT 

535
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,285
THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS TO 

536
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,620
SUPPORT, THE LIKELIHOOD THAT 

537
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,488
THEY BE ABLE TO PASS SOMETHING 

538
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,656
THAT GOES AGAINST WHAT HE'S 

539
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,491
TRYING TO DO IN THIS ARENA IS 

540
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,461
PRETTY UNLIKELY, ESPECIALLY IN 

541
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:22,962
AN ELECTON YEAR. 

542
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,798
>> NANCY CORDES, THANK YOU SO 

543
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:25,998
MUCH. 

544
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,632
>>>  AN OCCUPY I.C.E. 

545
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:28,834
MOVEMENT HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE 

546
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:29,768
COUNTRY FROM NEW YORK TO 

547
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,704
PORTLAND, CALLING FOR A CHANGE 

548
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:33,772
IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S 

549
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:34,039
POLICIES. 

550
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,575
THE PROTESTERS HAVE SET UP CAMP 

551
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,777
OUTSIDE SEVERAL OFFICES OF U.S. 

552
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:39,979

714
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:43,208
THERE WAS A BIT OF A SURPRISE ú

VEHEMENT DISAGREEMENT. 

716
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,510

BUT REGARDLESS, THE EFFECT IS 

720
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,650
THE SAME, BOTH BECAUSE OF THE 

721
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,651
GREAT DISCRETION THAT THESE 

722
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:54,285

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,681
A FOUR GONE CONCLUSION. 

737
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,982
WHAT THE COURT IS EFFECTIVELY 

738
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:24,816
SAYING THAT ANY PRESIDENT, 

739
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:25,884
INCLUDING THIS ONE, THE SAME 

740
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,118
RULES APPLY, AND WE AS A COURT 

741
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:28,653
ARE NOT GOING TO SECOND GUESS 

742
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:30,689
THAT, WE'RE NOT GOING TO 

743
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,223
BALANCE THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED 

744
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:34,526
AND MAKE A DIFFERENT POLICY 

745
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,129
JUDGMENT, BUT JUST BASED ON THE 

746
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,129
NORMAL STANDARDS THAT APPLY. 

747
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:39,598
úT 

748
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,199
RESTRICTIONS AS PRESENTED ON 

749
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,035
THE FACE OF THE PROCLAMATION AS 

750
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:45,270
IT WAS CALLED ARE LEGITIMATE. 

751
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,271
AND THAT'S THE END OF IT. 

752
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:49,340
AND IF CONGRESS WANTS TO CHANGE 

753
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,575
THE STATUTOR BALANCE OF POWER, 

754
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,544
THEY'RE FREE TO DO THAT, BUT 

755
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:56,681
COURTS ARE GOING TO DEFER AND 

756
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:57,783
THE CURRENT STATUTE IS VERY 

757
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:58,016
BROAD. 

758
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:58,717
>> SO THE OPINION HANDED DOWN 

759
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,286
BY THE COURT SAYS THE ORDER IS, 

760
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,922
QUOTE, SQUARELY WITHIN THE 

761
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:04,656
SCOPE OF PRESIDENTIAL 

762
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:04,956
AUTHORITY. 

763
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,159
HOW DOES THIS THEN DEFINE HOW 

764
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,827
MUCH UNILATERAL POWER THE 

765
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,628
PRESIDENT HAS? 

766
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:10,862
>> WELL, THE COURT GOES STATUTE 

767
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:15,066
BY STATUTE, TO AREA OF LAW TO 

768
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:15,934
AREA OF LAW. 

769
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,836
SO THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY 

770
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,037
HAVE ANY EFFECT ON PRESIDENT 

771
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,007
TRUMP AND WHAT HE'S DOING WITH 

772
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,041
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION OR 

773
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:27,112
ANYTHING ELSE, OR ANY OTHER 

774
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:27,912
TYPE OF EXECUTIVE ACTION. 

775
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:32,117
THE COURT LOOKED AT THE TEXT OF 

776
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,585
THE RELEVANT IMMIGRATION 

777
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:37,222
STATUTE WHICH THE DISSENTING 

778
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:37,822
JUSTICES, THE MAJORITY POINTS 

779
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:43,328
OUT DON'T EVEN GRAPPLE WITH IN 

780
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,730
THEIR OPINIONS, AND FOUND THAT 

781
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,032
CONGRESS GIVES VERY BROAD -- 

782
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,133
NOT UNREVIEWABLE BY COURTS, BUT 

783
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,935
VERY BROAD AUTHORITY TO THE 

784
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,536
PRESIDENT, AND MOREOVER, ALL OF 

785
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,705
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OR CANDIDATE 

786
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,006
TRUMP'S TWEETS AND OTHER 

787
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:55,606
STATEMENTS, THE CONTROVERSIAL 

788
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:57,776
FIERY RHETORIC AND WHATNOT, 

789
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,477
THEY LOOKED AT THAT, BUT THEN 

790
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:01,513
THEY SAY THERE WERE LEGITIMATE 

791
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,981
JUSTIFICATIONS AS WELL AND 

792
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,282
CARVEOUTS OF WHICH COUNTRIES 

793
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,684
AND IF YOU HAVE A LEGITIMATE 

794
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:06,985
REFINERY TO COME TO -- REASON 

795
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,087
TO COME TO AMERICA AND THINGS 

796
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:09,888
LIKE THIS, THEY WEIGHED ALL OF 

797
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,922
THAT AND SAID, LOOK, WE'RE NOT 

798
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:14,626
GOING TO OVERTURN THE PRESIDENT 

799
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,228
ON NATIONAL SECURITY BASED ON 

800
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:16,928
THESE SPECULATIVE ASSERTIONS OF 

801
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,730
HIS NOT HAVING A GOOD ENOUGH 

802
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,097
POLICY REASON. 

803
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,233
SO, YEAH, IN THIS ONE AREA IN 

804
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,667
TERMS OF RESTRICTING ENTRY TO 

805
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,003
THE COUNTRY, THE COURT HAS SAID 

806
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,838
THE PRESIDENT HAS BROAD POWER. 

807
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:27,973
ANYTHING ELSE, THAT'S A 

808
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:28,340
SEPARATE CASE. 

809
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,509
>> NOW, JUST SPEAKING ABOUT THE 

810
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,510
JUSTICES IN PARTICULAR, NEIL 

811
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,911
GORSUCH HAS BEEN PRAISED BY 

812
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,079
REPUBLICANS FOR HIS ROLE IN THE 

813
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:37,382
RULING, WE SAW THAT PHOTO OF, 

814
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:40,585
YOU KNOW, THE HANDSHAKE JUST TO 

815
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:40,986
PRAISE THAT. 

816
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,754
THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS FOR 

817
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,922
MONTHS THAT CHIEF JUSTICE 

818
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,424
KENNEDY MAY RETIRE. 

819
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,827
SO WHAT'S AT STAKE FOR THE NEXT 

820
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:49,094
VACANCY? 

821
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,529
>> WELL, 24 HOURS FROM NOW WE 

822
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,030
MAY BE TALKING ABOUT THE LEGACY 

823
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,999
OF JUSTICE KENNEDY AND THE 

824
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:54,532
BATTLE FOR HIS SUCCESSOR. 

825
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:56,835
TOMORROW IS THE NEXT AND LAST 

826
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,236
DAY THAT THE COURT IS HANDING 

827
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,604
DOWN OPINIONS, OR WE MIGHT HEAR 

828
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:04,009
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER, HE 

829
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,611
MIGHT SEND A TELEGRAM FROM 

830
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,812
SALTZBURG SAYING THAT. 

831
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:09,314
COURT IS POISED AS WE'VE SEEN. 

832
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,581
THE COURT DECIDED 5-4 TODAY THE 

833
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:11,917
TRAVEL BAN AND A FIRST 

834
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,317
AMENDMENT CASE OF A CALIFORNIA 

835
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:14,151
LAW WITH ABORTION CLINICS WHAT 

836
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:17,923
THEY HAVE TO SAY OR DON'T HAVE 

837
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:18,156
TO SAY. 

838
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,025
SO THAT NEXT JUSTICE IS GOING 

839
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:21,392
TO BE PIVOTAL. 

840
00:24:21,392 --> 00:24:23,228
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP OR ANOTHER 

841
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,931
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IS ALLOWED 

842
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,132
TO CONFIRM HIS NOMINEE, THEN 

843
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:27,933
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS 

844
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:28,767
EFFECTIVELY BECOMES THE 

845
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,236
MAJORITY OF THE COURT, THE 

846
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,705
COURT'S BALANCE SHIFTS RIGHT IN 

847
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:34,105
MANY WAYS. 

848
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,407
IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, NOBODY 

849
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:38,810
IS CONFIRMED OR THE DEMOCRATS 

850
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,711
TAKE THE SENATE AND THERE'S 

851
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,046
THAT VACANCY THAT REMAINS, THEN 

852
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,948
THAT WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT 

853
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:43,681
DIFFERENCE AS WELL. 

854
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:45,216
SO JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS MEAN 

855
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:45,483
THINGS. 

856
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,985
WE LEARNED THAT IN THE 2016 

857
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,453
ELECTION WHERE IT'S POSSIBLE 

858
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,456
THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD NOT 

859
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,624
HAVE WON WITHOUT THE SCALIA 

860
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,725
VACANCY CRYSTALLIZING THE ISSUE 

861
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:54,459
FOR MANY VOTERS. 

862
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,728
SO THAT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO 

863
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,430
BE A BIG CAMPAIGN ISSUE IN 

864
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,432
NOVEMBER WHETHER A NEW JUSTICE 

865
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,232
WILL HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED OR NOT 

866
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:01,499
BY THEN. 

867
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,335
>> WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. 

868
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:06,204
ILYA SHAPIRO, THANK YOU SO MUCH 

869

COLORADO, MARYLAND, NEW YORK,

OKLAHOMA AND UTAH HAVE THEIR 

875
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:15,914
PRIMARIES. 

876
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:20,218
MISSISSIPPI AND SOUTH CAROLINA 

877
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,753
ARE HOLDING RUNOFF ELECTIONS. 

878
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,521

00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,155
MATTERS, WE'RE TAKING A CLOSER 

880
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:24,622
LOOK AT MISSISSIPPI.

VOTERS THERE ARE DECIDING WHO 

882
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,793

883
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,428
NOVEMBER FOR HOUSE AND SENATE 

884
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:30,829
RACES. 

885
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:31,362
MISSISSIPPI DEMOCRATS ARE 

886
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:32,731

00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:33,725
ANGELES WHICH IS WHERE HE'S 

920
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,827
FROM, CALIFORNIA, BUT HE'S ALSO 

921
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,429
THE HUSBAND OF MISSISSIPPI 

922
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,129
PERSON CELIA WARD, AN EMMY-

923
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,031
AWARD WINNING ACTRESS AND WELL 

924
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,799
THOUGHT OF IN THIS STATE, AND 

925
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,568
THEY NOW LIVE IN MERIDIAN, 

926
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,003
MISSISSIPPI, AND HE'S COME BACK 

927
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,504
AND OPTED AROUND FOR THIS 

928
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:50,408
SENATE SEAT, AND IT'S TURNED 

929
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,811
INTO QUITE A BATTLE BETWEEN 

930
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:53,544
SHERMAN AND BARIA. 

931
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:56,414
THEY BOTH HAVE RUN A SPIRITED 

932
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:56,815
CAMPAIGN. 

933
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,283
BARIA HAS GOTTEN THE 

934
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,017
ENDORSEMENTS OF MOST OF THE 

935
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,952
DEMOCRATIC ELECTED OFFICIALS IN 

936
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,154
THE STATE, NOT ALL OF THEM, BUT 

937
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:03,755
MOST OF THEM. 

938
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,058
AND SHERMAN HAS KIND OF 

939
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,629
DEPENDED A LOT ON HIS OWN DEEP 

940
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,863
POCKETS TO FINANCE HIS RACE, 

941
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,965
AND HE'S DONE BETTER THAN A LOT 

942
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,533
OF PEOPLE EXPECTED. 

943
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,936
YOU KNOW, HIS MONEY MAKES A BIG 

944
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:20,505
DIFFERENCE IN THE DEMOCRATIC 

945
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,341
POLITICS BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY 

946
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,409
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL ELECTIONS 

947
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,410
DEMOCRATS IN MISSISSIPPI HAVE 

948
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,680
HAD A HARD TIME RAISING MONEY 

949
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,714
FOR THEIR CAMPAIGNS. 

950
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:30,815
SO SHERMAN HAS PUT ABOUT 

951
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,383
$850,000 AT LEAST OF HIS OWN 

952
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:33,350
MONEY INTO THE CAMPAIGN. 

953
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,652
IT'S MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. 

954
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,254
>> NOW, IT WAS SUCH A CLOSE 

955
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,956
RACE IN THE PRIMARIES WITH -- 

956
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,258
THEY WERE EACH WITHIN ABOUT 1% 

957
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,125
OF EACH OTHER ON JUNE 5th. 

958
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,061
SO WHO DO YOU THINK MIGHT COME 

959
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:46,698
OUT AHEAD TODAY, AND HOW MUCH 

960
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,666
DOES IT REALLY MATTER IN 

961
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,033
NOVEMBER? 

962
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,969
>> WELL, THOSE ARE BOTH GOOD 

963
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:51,636
QUESTIONS, AND THE FIRST 

964
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,405
QUESTION, I MEAN, IT'S SO MUCH 

965
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,405
-- I MEAN, THE VOTE, THE 

966
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:57,208
TURNOUT WAS REAL LOW AND THE 

967
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,211
VOTE WAS SO CLOSE IT DEPENDS ON 

968
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,014
WHICH CANDIDATE IS ABLE TO GET 

969
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,482
HIS VOTE BACK TO THE POLLS 

970
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:04,715
TODAY. 

971
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:06,217
YOU KNOW, THERE'S THIS SCHOOL 

972
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,453
OF THOUGHT THAT BARIA WHO HAS 

973
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,854
DEEP ROOTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC 

974
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,454
PARTY IN MISSISSIPPI, HIS 

975
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:12,357
VOTERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO COME 

976
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,958
BACK TO THE POLLS FOR A RUNOFF, 

977
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,460
BUT, YOU KNOW, SHERMAN, AS I 

978
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,795
SAID, HAS RUN A SPIRITED 

979
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,763
CAMPAIGN AND HAS WORKED REAL 

980
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:19,063
HARD. 

981
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:20,832
SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S ANYBODY'S 

982
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,600
GUESS I THINK. 

983
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,635
I WON'T BE SURPRISED EITHER 

984
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,336
WAY. 

985
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,506
NOW, AS FAR AS NOVEMBER, ROGER 

986
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,042
WICKER IS A REPUBLICAN. 

987
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,411
HE'S CONSIDERED A HEAVY 

988
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,245
FAVORITE TO WIN RE-ELECTION. 

989
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,815
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS AN 

990
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,017
INTERESTING RACE AND BOTH BARIA 

991
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:39,818
AND SHERMAN ARE RUNNING 

992
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:40,952
LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGNS WHICH 

993
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,253
ALWAYS DOESN'T OCCUR IN 

994
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,255
MISSISSIPPI WHEN THERE'S A 

995
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,056
STRONG REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT 

996
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,157
ALREADY IN OFFICE. 

997
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:46,958
THEY RUN LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGNS, 

998
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,027
AND THEY'RE RUNNING IT AS TRUE 

999
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:49,327
DEMOCRATS. 

1000
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:53,832
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO 

1001
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:54,598
RUN NECESSARILY TO THE MIDDLE. 

1002
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:56,901
I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT RUNNING WAY 

1003
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,936
OUT TO THE LEFT, BUT AT TRUE 

1004
00:28:58,936 --> 00:28:59,236
DEMOCRATS. 

1005
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:01,439
THEY BOTH CRITICIZE PRESIDENT 

1006
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,006
TRUMP WHICH IS UNUSUAL IN 

1007
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:05,009
MISSISSIPPI POLITICS, YOU KNOW, 

1008
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,411
VARIOUS THOUGHTS 

1009
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,112
ABOUT RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, 

1010
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:09,314
SO THEY'RE RUNNING TRUE 

1011
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,682
DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGNS, WHICH, AS 

1012
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,116
I SAID, IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE 

1013
00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:13,618
CASE IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES IN 

1014
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:13,952
MISSISSIPPI. 

1015
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,254
THERE'S A TENDENCY TO TRY TO 

1016
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,088
RUN TOWARDS THE MIDDLE. 

1017
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,123
SO I GUESS THEY'RE VIEWING THAT 

1018
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:20,024
THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC BASE OUT 

1019
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,760
THERE THAT THEY CAN TAP INTO 

1020
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,661
THAT WILL NOT ONLY HELP THEM 

1021
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,363
TODAY BUT MAYBE EVEN CARRY THEM 

1022
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:26,164
IN NOVEMBER IN THE GENERAL 

1023
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:26,431
ELECTION. 

1024
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,366
>> DO YOU THINK EITHER OF THEM 

1025
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,236
REALLY STAND A CHANCE IN SUCH A 

1026
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,237
RED STATE? 

1027
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,205
AND HOW PIVOTAL IS THIS SEAT IN 

1028
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:34,538
THE SENATE? 

1029
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:36,608
>> IT'S CONSIDERED A SAFE 

1030
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,008
REPUBLICAN SEAT. 

1031
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:40,211
SO, I MEAN, IF EITHER ONE OF 

1032
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,213
THEM -- IF THE WINNER WON TODAY 

1033
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,515
WHO WINS IN NOVEMBER IT WILL BE 

1034
00:29:44,515 --> 00:29:45,115
THE BIGGEST POLITICAL UPSET. 

1035
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:45,749
I'VE BEEN COVERING MISSISSIPPI 

1036
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:49,254
POLITICS FOR A LONG TIME, IT 

1037
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,055
WILL BE THE BIGGEST POLITICAL 

1038
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,423
UPSET THAT I'VE SEEN IF IT 

1039
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:52,690
OCCURRED. 

1040
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,758
BUT THERE ARE A FEW WILDCARDS 

1041
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:54,892
IN PLAY THAT COULD MAKE A 

1042
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:55,192
DIFFERENCE. 

1043
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:57,328
FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW, WHILE 

1044
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,064
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS POPULAR IN 

1045
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:05,436
MISSISSIPPI, YOU KNOW, THERE IS 

1046
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,105
SOME RESENTMENT TOWARD HIM AND 

1047
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,106
PRETTY ENTHUSIASTIC THAT 

1048
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:08,406
RESENTMENT. 

1049
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:11,910
THERE'S ALSO A SPECIAL SENATE 

1050
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,511
ELECTION ON THAT SAME DAY. 

1051
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,078
THAD COCHRAN WHO IS ANOTHER 

1052
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,413
U.S. SENATOR RESIGNED EARLIER 

1053
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,414
THIS YEAR FOR HEALTH REASONS, 

1054
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,549
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A 

1055
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:19,784
SPECIAL ELECTION TO REPLACE 

1056
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:19,984
HIM. 

1057
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,053
AND THAT ELECTION IS GETTING A 

1058
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,087
LOT OF ATTENTION BECAUSE MIKE 

1059
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,822
ESPY IS RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT. 

1060
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:26,958
HE WAS THE FIRST BLACK ELECTED 

1061
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:30,228
TO CONGRESS FROM MISSISSIPPI 

1062
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,062
SIN RECONSTRUCTION, AND HE'S 

1063
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,664
ALSO WITH THE SECOND IN THE 

1064
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,164
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. 

1065
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,667
AND SOME PEOPLE THINK HE CAN 

1066
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,202
ENERGIZE A SIZEABLE AFRICAN-

1067
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:40,572
AMERICAN VOTE BASE AND MAKE 

1068
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,040
THAT ELECTION, THE SPECIAL 

1069
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,909
ELECTION AS WELL AS THE WICKER 

1070
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,010
ELECTION CLOSER THAN IT MIGHT 

1071
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,343
NORMALLY BE. 

1072
00:30:46,343 --> 00:30:49,013
>> WELL, WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S 

1073
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,915
ANY KIND OF SIGNS FOR AN UPSET. 

1074
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,116
BOBBY HARRISON, THANK YOU SO 

1075
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:52,417

THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS ON

IMMIGRATION. 

1082

PRESIDENT'S TRADE POLICIES.

00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:13,438
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 

1090

1091
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,753
I THINK PEOPLE THAT RIDE

HARLEYS ARE NOT HAPPY WITH 

1093
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:12,523
HARLEY DAVIDSON AND I WOULDN'T 

1094
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:13,190
BE EITHER. 

1095
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,659
BUT MOSTLY COMPANIES ARE COMING 

1096
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,225
BACK TO OUR COUNTRY. 

1097
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:19,130

00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,867
WHERE THEY HAD A TARIFF OF 

1100
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:23,067
100%. 

1101
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,169
AND I GOT IT DOWN TO A MUCH 

1102
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:25,803
LOWER NUMBER. 

1103
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,673
I THINK IT'S 50% WHICH IS FAR 

1104
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,443
TOO MUCH, BUT THEY WERE PAYING 

1105
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:32,776
100% TARIFF. 

1106
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:33,711
NOW PRIME MINISTER MODI BROUGHT 

1107
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:37,715
IT WAY DOWN, BUT IT'S STILL WAY 

1108
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:37,982
TOO HIGH. 

1109
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,352
I WILL SAY THIS, JOHN, OTHER 

1110
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,052
COUNTRIES ARE NEGOTIATING, AND 

1111
00:33:42,052 --> 00:33:43,955
WITHOUT TARIFFS YOU COULD NEVER 

1112
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:44,222
DO THAT. 

1113
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,558
AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO 

1114
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,061
NEGOTIATE, THEN WE'LL DO THE 

1115
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:50,328
TARIFFS. 

1116
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:50,995
AND JUST REMEMBER WITH THE BANK 

1117
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:51,162
-- 

1118
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,864
>> THAT WAS PRESIDENT DONALD 

1119
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,732
TRUMP TODAY REACTING TO HARLEY 

1120
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:58,269
DAVIDSON'S DECISION TO MOVE 

1121
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,136
SOME OF ITS PRODUCTION 

1122
00:33:59,136 --> 00:33:59,403
OVERSEAS. 

1123
00:33:59,403 --> 00:33:59,737
THE REASON? 

1124
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:00,605
THE E.U.'S RETALIATORY TARIFFS 

1125
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,240
AFTER THE PRESIDENT IMPOSED 

1126
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,741
TARIFFS ON ALUMINUM AND STEEL 

1127
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:04,142
IMPORTS. 

1128
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:07,044
FOR MORE WE TURN TO THE 

1129
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,112
"WASHINGTON POST"'S FINANCIAL 

1130
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,514
WRITER COVERING TRADE AND 

1131
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,347
GLOBALIZATION DAVID LYNCH. 

1132
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:14,284
DAVID, THANKS FOR JOINING US. 

1133
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:14,985
>> SURE. 

1134
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:16,353
>> AFTER THREATENING ALLIES AT 

1135
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:17,554
A CONTENTIOUS G7 SUMMIT, 

1136
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:19,157
PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW SEEMS TO BE 

1137
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,425
CAUSING MORE CONTROVERSY BY 

1138
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,458
THREATENING AMERICAN COMPANIES 

1139
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:22,460
LIKE HARLEY DAVIDSON WITH 

1140
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:22,693
TAXES. 

1141
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:23,860
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE 

1142
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,264
OVERALL END GAME FOR THE WHITE 

1143
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:28,699
HOUSE WITH THIS APPROACH? 

1144
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:32,737
>> WELL, IT'S PROBABLY ANYONE'S 

1145
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,505
GUESS, BUT THERE'S TWO POSSIBLE 

1146
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:35,840
OUTCOMES, EITHER THESE TARIFFS 

1147
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,341
GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE LEVERAGE 

1148
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,678
THAT HE'S SEEKING TO HAVE A 

1149
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,413
NGOTIATION WITH EUROPE AND 

1150
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:42,913
PRESUMABLY REDUCE TRADE 

1151
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:43,746
BARRIERS ACROSS THE BOARD, OR 

1152
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:47,851
THEY STAY IN PLACE AND WE'RE ON 

1153
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:49,353
OUR WAY TO A TIT-FOR-TAT TRADE 

1154
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:49,553
WAR. 

1155
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:51,121
>> NOW, THE PRESIDENT SAID WHAT 

1156
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:53,757
HE'S DOING HERE IS TAKING AN 

1157
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:54,759
AMERICA FIRST APPROACH TO 

1158
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:54,992
TRADE. 

1159
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:55,860
BUT HARLEY DAVIDSON IS STILL 

1160
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,261
PLANNING ON SENDING A PORTION 

1161
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:57,928
OF ITS PRODUCTION OVERSEAS. 

1162
00:34:57,928 --> 00:35:01,365
SO DOES THE HARLEY MOVE SHOW 

1163
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:02,366
THAT THE PRESIDENT'S TRADE 

1164
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:02,866
APPROACH IS BACKFIRING? 

1165
00:35:02,866 --> 00:35:04,702
>> WELL, IT CERTAINLY SHOWS 

1166
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,938
THAT THERE ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED 

1167
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,205
WITH IT. 

1168
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,839
A TRADE WAR IS LIKE ANY OTHER 

1169
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:10,908
WAR, THE OTHER SIDE GETS TO 

1170
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:11,542
SHOOT BACK. 

1171
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,612
AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT PUT 

1172
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,612
THESE STEEL AND ALUMINUM 

1173
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:18,316
TARIFFS IN PLACE, THE EUROPEAN 

1174
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,418
UNION SAID THEY WOULD 

1175
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,053
RETALIATED, AND THAT MEANS 

1176
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,456
MANUFACTURERS THAT WANT TO SHIP 

1177
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,525
PRODUCTS TO EUROPE LIKE HARLEY 

1178
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,826
DAVIDSON FACE HIGHER TARIFFS. 

1179
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:30,962
THAT REDUCES DEMAND FOR THEIR 

1180
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,064
PRODUCTS IN EUROPE, AND THAT'S 

1181
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,164
AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM FOR THEM. 

1182
00:35:34,164 --> 00:35:36,367
AND NOW HARLEY IS DOING PRETTY 

1183
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,702
MUCH WHAT YOU'D EXPECT A 

1184
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:40,704
COMPANY TO DO. 

1185
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:42,639
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND A MORE 

1186
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,541
EFFECTIVE AND COST-EFFECTIVE 

1187
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,676
WAY OF GETTING THEIR PRODUCT 

1188
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,613
INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR 

1189
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:48,913
CUSTOMERS. 

1190
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,414
AND IN THIS CASE THAT MEANS NOT 

1191
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,749
MAKING IN THE UNITED STATES 

1192
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,284
ANYMORE, BUT MAKING IT 

1193
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:53,551
OVERSEAS. 

1194
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,453
>> SO THE E.U.'S TAXES WEREN'T 

1195
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,455
JUST PLACED ON COMPANIES LIKE 

1196
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,157
HARLEY DAVIDSON, BASED OUT OF 

1197
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:00,824
WISCONSIN, OF COURSE, BUT ALSO 

1198
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:01,391
BOURBON FROM KENTUCKY AND 

1199
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:03,527
TOBACCO IN NORTH CAROLINA. 

1200
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:06,164
DO YOU THINK THE EUROPEAN 

1201
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:06,964
TARIFFS ARE STRATEGICALLY 

1202
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,032
TARGETING POLITICALLY IMPORTANT 

1203
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,468
STATES TO THE TRUMP 

1204
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:10,835
ADMINISTRATION? 

1205
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,470
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT 

1206
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,905
THAT'S THE CASE, AS IS THE CASE 

1207
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:18,209
WITH THE TRADE CONFLICT GOING 

1208
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,543
ON WITH CHINA. 

1209
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:20,912
OUR U.S. TRADING PARTNERS 

1210
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,314
RECOGNIZE THAT THE WAY TO BRING 

1211
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:27,118
PRESSURE TO BEAR IN THE U.S. 

1212
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,920
SYSTEM IS TO CAUSE COMPANIES 

1213
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,188
AND THEIR WORKERS PAIN IN 

1214
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:31,788
POLITICALLY IMPORTANT STATES. 

1215
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:35,059
THE HOPE ON THE PART OF THE 

1216
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:38,262
TRADING PARTNERS IS THAT THOSE 

1217
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:38,829
COMPANIES COMPLAIN TO THEIR 

1218
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:39,396
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND 

1219
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:41,365
THEY IN TURN GO TO THE 

1220
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,099
PRESIDENT AND SAY, LOOK, YOU'RE 

1221
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,469
GOING TO KILL US IN THE FALL IN 

1222
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,069
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, UNLESS 

1223
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:48,706
YOU BACK OFF FROM SOME OF THESE 

1224
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,440
TARIFFS. 

1225
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,707
THAT'S CERTAINLY THE MESSAGE 

1226
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:51,642
THAT MANY OF THE REPUBLICAN 

1227
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:54,312
LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL HAVE 

1228
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,413
BEEN DELIVERING TO THE WHITE 

1229
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:55,813
HOUSE PRIVATELY. 

1230
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:56,947
>> SO IF THIS IS INDEED A TRADE 

1231
00:36:56,947 --> 00:36:58,816
WAR AS YOU SAY, IS THIS A SIGN 

1232
00:36:58,816 --> 00:36:59,183
THAT THE E.U. 

1233
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:02,686
MAY HAVE AN EDGE ON THE UNITED 

1234
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:04,921
STATES AND WILL OTHER COMPANIES 

1235
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:05,255
FOLLOW SUIT? 

1236
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:07,358
>> WELL, OTHER COMPANIES ARE 

1237
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,561
CERTAINLY GOING TO FEEL THE 

1238
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,563
SAME EFFECTS THAT HARLEY 

1239
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,664
DAVIDSON IS FEELING. 

1240
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:14,064
WHETHER THE E.U. 

1241
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:16,968
HAS AN EDGE OR NOT I DON'T 

1242
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:17,168
KNOW. 

1243
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,437
I MEAN, WHAT MANY TRADE EXPERTS 

1244
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,239
SAY ABOUT THESE SORT OF 

1245
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,708
COMMERCIAL CONFLICTS IS THAT 

1246
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,442
THERE'S REALLY NO WINNER, THAT 

1247
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,811
BOTH SIDES IN A TRADE WAR END 

1248
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:30,915
UP WORSE OFF, AND THAT MAY BE 

1249
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,583
WHERE WE'RE HEADED. 

1250
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,653
>> DAVID LYNCH, THANK YOU SO 

1251
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:35,853
MUCH. 

1252
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:38,823
>>>  IN A 5-4 RULING TODAY 

1253
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,358
ALONG PARTISAN LINE, THE U.S. 

1254
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,059
SUPREME COURT UPHELD PRESIDENT

SEVERAL PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM 

1257

COUNTRIES. 

1258
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:47,164
THE BAN LIMITS THE NUMBER OF 

1259
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,268
VISAS GRANTED TO TRAVELERS FROM

SOMALIA, SYRIA AND YEMEN. 

1263
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,906
IT ALSO ADDS RESTRICTIONS TO

PEOPLE IN NORTH KOREA AND 

1265
00:37:56,473 --> 00:37:57,441
VENEZUELA. 

1266
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,043
THIS IS THE THIRD VERSION OF

00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,010
THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRAVEL 

1268

BAN. 

1269
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,546
THE RULING REVERSES A SERIES OF 

1270
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:05,049
LOWER COURT DECISIONS THAT HAVE 

1271
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,517
PREVIOUSLY BEEN STRUCK DOWN. 

1272

PROCLAMATION IS WITHIN THE,

QUOTE, SCOPE OF PRESIDENTIAL 

1282

AUTHORITY. 

1283
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:23,667
TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP APPLAUDED 

1284
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:27,438
THAT DECISION WITH WITH LUNCH 

1285
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,639
WITH CONGRESSIONAL LAWMAKERS. 

1286
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,940
>> TODAY'S SUPREME COURT RULING 

1287
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,510
JUST COMING OUT A TREMENDOUS 

1288
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,478
SUCCESS, A TREMENDOUS VICTORY 

1289
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,915
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND FOR 

1290
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:38,716
OUR CONSTITUTION. 

1291
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,717
THIS IS A GREAT VICTORY FOR OUR 

1292
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:40,050
CONSTITUTION. 

1293
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,953
WE HAVE TO BE TOUGH AND WE HAVE 

1294
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:46,357
TO BE SAFE, AND WE HAVE TO BE 

1295
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:46,590
SECURE. 

1296
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,259
AT A MINIMUM WE HAVE TO MAKE 

1297
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,961
SURE THAT WE VET PEOPLE COMING 

1298
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:51,828
INTO THE COUNTRY. 

1299
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:58,569
WE KNOW WHO'S COMING IN, WE 

1300
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,504
KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM. 

1301
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,205
>> CBS NEWS WASHINGTON 

1302
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,440
CORRESPONDENT PAULA READ JOINS 

1303
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,641
US NOW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1304
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,444
PAULA, THIS WAS A HUGE WIN FOR 

1305
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,011
THE PRESIDENT. 

1306
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,845
COULD THE SUPREME COURT 

1307
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,012
DECISION ENCOURAGE PRESIDENT 

1308
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:10,214
TRUMP AND HIS ADMINISTRATION TO 

1309
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,849
TAKE EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE MOVES 

1310
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,418
TO CUT DOWN ON TRAVEL FROM MORE 

1311
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:15,018
MAJORITY MUSLIM COUNTRIES? 

1312
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:16,253
>>REPORTER:  WELL, YOU'RE 

1313
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:16,486
RIGHT. 

1314
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:17,253
THIS WAS A HUGE WIN. 

1315
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:18,656
THIS WAS HIS FIRST BIG VICTORY 

1316
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,957
AT THE SUPREME COURT, HIS FIRST 

1317
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,659
BIG LEGAL CHALLENGE AT THE 

1318
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:22,560
SUPREME COURT, AND HE WON. 

1319
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,028
SO THIS WAS A RARE DAY HERE AT 

1320
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:24,829
THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE HE GETS 

1321
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:28,799
TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A VICTORY 

1322
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,367
LAP BECAUSE HERE CHIEF JUSTICE 

1323
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,569
JOHN ROBERTS, HE UPHELD A VERY 

1324
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:32,536
EXPANSIVE DEFINITION OF THE 

1325
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,337
PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY TO DECIDE 

1326
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,139
WHO COMES IN AND OUT OF THIS 

1327
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:35,439
COUNTRY. 

1328
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,740
AND, YES, THERE IS A 

1329
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,543
POSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD ADD 

1330
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,276
ADDITIONAL MUSLIM COUNTRIES 

1331
00:39:40,276 --> 00:39:41,011
GOING FORWARD, BUT THE MORE 

1332
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,247
IMMEDIATE QUESTION IS WHETHER 

1333
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,316
OR NOT THIS WILL EMBOLDEN THE 

1334
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:45,849
PRESIDENT ON IMMIGRATION. 

1335
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:48,452
AS WE HEARD RIGHT THERE WHEN HE 

1336
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,153
WAS MEETING WITH CONGRESSIONAL 

1337
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,454
LEADERS, HE REITERATED HIS NEED 

1338
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,189
TO CONTROL WHO COMES IN AND OUT 

1339
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,523
OF THIS COUNTRY FOR NATIONAL 

1340
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:53,790
SECURITY. 

1341
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,459
SO THE FACT THAT THE SUPREME 

1342
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,361
COURT HAS HANDED HIM A VICTORY 

1343
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,964
HERE AND VALIDATED THIS BROAD 

1344
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:00,865
SCOPE OF HIS PRESIDENTIAL 

1345
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:01,966
AUTHORITY ON NATIONAL SECURITY, 

1346
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:02,832
WE WOULD EXPECT THIS MAY 

1347
00:40:02,832 --> 00:40:05,269
EMBOLDEN HIM IN TERMS OF HIS 

1348
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,037
LANGUAGE AND A POLICY ON THE 

1349
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:07,470
IMMIGRATION ISSUE. 

1350
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,974
>> WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS 

1351
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:10,641
REALLY AFFECTS HIS APPROACH 

1352
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,643
WITH THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE 

1353
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:13,344
THAT'S UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW AT 

1354
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:13,644
THE BORDER. 

1355
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,011
NOW, IN TERMS OF THE TRAVEL 

1356
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:18,516
BAN, THIS WAS THE THIRD VERSION 

1357
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,117
OF THE TRAVEL BAN, AND THE 

1358
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:20,684
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ARGUED 

1359
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,086
THIS VERSION WOULD BE DIFFERENT 

1360
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,654
AND WAS CONSIDERED A WATERED 

1361
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:24,555
DOWN VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL 

1362
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:24,755
PLAN. 

1363
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,156
HOW DIFFERENT WAS IT REALLY, 

1364
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:27,658
AND WHAT WERE THE IMPORTANT 

1365
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,960
POINTS THAT YOU THINK ALLOWED 

1366
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,462
THE SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD IT? 

1367
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,563
>> WELL, IT WAS INCREDIBLY 

1368
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:32,863
DIFFERENT. 

1369
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,164
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE FIRST 

1370
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:35,165
TRAVEL BAN THAT WAS ISSUED JUST 

1371
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:37,334
WITHIN HIS FIRST FEW DAYS IN 

1372
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:37,968
OFFICE THAT THAT REALLY WOULD 

1373
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:38,769
HAVE PASSED MUSTER AT THE 

1374
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,136
SUPREME COURT. 

1375
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,704
I REMEMBER THE DAY THAT WAS 

1376
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:40,938
PASSED. 

1377
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,339
WE CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF 

1378
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:42,772
HOMELAND SECURITY. 

1379
00:40:42,772 --> 00:40:43,541
THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS 

1380
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,342
COMING, THEY HAD NO IDEA HOW 

1381
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,610
THEY WERE GOING TO IMPLEMENT 

1382
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:46,776
IT. 

1383
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:48,646
THAT FIRST TRAVEL BAN, IT HAD 

1384
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,214
NO EXCEPTIONS FOR ANY SORT OF 

1385
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:50,681
UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES. 

1386
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,618
IT DID APPEAR TO BE SORT OF A 

1387
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:58,255
BLANKET MUSLIM BAN WITH NO 

1388
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,723
FORWARD THINKING LOGISTICAL 

1389
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:00,190
COORDINATION ACROSS 

1390
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:00,590
ADMINISTRATIONS. 

1391
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,959
FOR THE SECOND TRAVEL BAN, THE 

1392
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,860
ADMINISTRATION WAS A LITTLE 

1393
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,293
MORE FULLY FORMED. 

1394
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:04,461
AT THAT POINT HE HAD A 

1395
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:05,262
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 

1396
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,164
CHIEF, HE HAD AN ATTORNEY 

1397
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,666
GENERAL, AND THEY HELPED ADVISE 

1398
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,401
HIM BASED ON THINGS THAT JUDGES 

1399
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,770
HAD SPECIFICALLY SAID WAS WRONG 

1400
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,637
WITH THE FIRST ONE. 

1401
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,271
THEN THEY DID ANOTHER ITERATION 

1402
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,439
BEFORE THE SECOND ONE GOT ALL 

1403
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,041
THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT, 

1404
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:21,045
AND IT DOES SEEM TO BE A MORE 

1405
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,012
FULLY REALIZED VERSION OF THIS 

1406
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:22,245
POLICY. 

1407
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:23,514
THERE WERE SURVEYS THAT THEY 

1408
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,848
DID WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO 

1409
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:26,417
REALLY VET EACH COUNTRY IN 

1410
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,786
TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THOSE 

1411
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:29,519
COUNTRIES WERE ACTUALLY 

1412
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:30,354
PROVIDING ACCURATE INFORMATION 

1413
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,689
ABOUT THEIR CITIZENS WHO ARE 

1414
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,457
COMING HERE, AND THEY MADE A 

1415
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:34,858
DECISION TO INCLUDE THIS GROUP 

1416
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:37,027
OF COUNTRIES, AND IT WASN'T 

1417
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,028
JUST PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM 

1418
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:38,328
COUNTRIES. 

1419
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:38,928
THEY OBVIOUSLY ADDITIONALLY 

1420
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:40,264
ADDED NORTH KOREA AND 

1421
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,865
VENEZUELA, SO IT SEEMED LESS 

1422
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:42,999
LIKE A QUOTE, UNQUOTE MUSLIM 

1423
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:45,169
BAN THAT WAS KNOCKED DOWN IN 

1424
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,338
THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS AND MORE 

1425
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,440
LIKE A NATIONAL SECURITY 

1426
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,140
POLICY. 

1427
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,742
>> I WONDER HOW THAT BAN ON 

1428
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:52,743
CERTAIN NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS 

1429
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,444
WILL AFFECT THIS NOW MOVING 

1430
00:41:54,444 --> 00:41:55,746
FORWARD AS THINGS HAVE BEEN 

1431
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,448
GETTING A LITTLE BIT LESS TENSE 

1432
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,248
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND NORTH 

1433
00:41:58,248 --> 00:41:58,616
KOREA. 

1434
00:41:58,616 --> 00:41:59,617
BUT FOCUSING ON THE BORDER AND 

1435
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,251
THE WALL, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID 

1436
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:02,686
HE WILL ASK CONGRESS FOR 

1437
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,555
INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE WALL. 

1438
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,956
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS RULING 

1439
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:06,957
WILL AFFECT HIS EFFORTS TO 

1440
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,459
RECEIVE THAT FUNDING ? 

1441
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:09,960
>>REPORTER:  WELL, IT WAS 

1442
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,694
INTERESTING WATCHING AT HIS 

1443
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,062
CONGRESSIONAL LEADER HOSS CAME 

1444
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:12,896
HERE TO THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY. 

1445
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:14,164
MANY OF THEM WERE HOPING TO GET 

1446
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,066
SOME ANSWERS ON WHETHER THE 

1447
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:16,834
PRESIDENT REALLY DOES SUPPORT 

1448
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,068
THE GOP COMPROMISE ON 

1449
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,169
IMMIGRATION, AND THE FIRST TIME 

1450
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,237
THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED 

1451
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:20,938
IMMIGRATION AFTER TAKING A 

1452
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:21,972
VICTORY LAP ABOUT THE SUPREME 

1453
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,373
COURT WAS TO TALK ABOUT FUNDING 

1454
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:26,844
FOR THE BORDER WALL AND HOW HE 

1455
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:27,577
CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THAT 

1456
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:28,913
IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURING 

1457
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:29,679
SECURITY AT THE BORDER. 

1458
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,015
HE BELIEVES THAT WALL WOULD 

1459
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,249
PREVENT PEOPLE FROM COMING HERE 

1460
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,985
AND ALSO BRINGING DRUGS AND 

1461
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:35,953
OTHER THINGS HERE. 

1462
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:38,055
HE BELIEVESTHAT REALLY IS THE 

1463
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,156
SOLUTION, AND ANY SORT OF 

1464
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,691
LEGISLATIVE COMPROMISE, HE 

1465
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:41,959
WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE'S 

1466
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,761
NOT ONLY GETTING THE FUNDED 

1467
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:44,762
ALLOCATED BUT THAT IT'S 

1468
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:45,229
ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED. 

1469
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,664
AND THAT WAS A KEY DIFFERENCE 

1470
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,066
IN THE TWO GOP PROPOSALS ON 

1471
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:49,399
IMMIGRATION. 

1472
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:50,367
THE MORE HARD LINE APPROACH, WE 

1473
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,369
THOUGHT A LOT OF THE 

1474
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:52,969

1475
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:53,303
REALLY LIKE. 

1476
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:54,538
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT 

1477
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,140
THE PRESIDENT WASN'T GUARANTEED 

1478
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,241
FUNDING FOR A BORDER WALL. 

1479

NOW THE GOP COMPROMISE BILL, 

1480
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,677
THAT WILL GIVE HIM THE MONEY 

1481
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,613
FOR HIS BORDER WALL, BUT AT 

1482
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:03,547
THIS POINT, ADRIANA, IT DOESN'T 

1483
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,049
APPEAR THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO 

1484
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:05,816

VICTORY IN THE MIDTERM 

1492
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:18,962
