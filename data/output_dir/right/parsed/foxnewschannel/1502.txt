INTELLIGENCE, NOT THE SPIN
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE
WAS SPYING, MARTHA.
>> ED, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SO MY NEXT GUEST SAYS THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ACTING
LIKE A DICTATOR FOR TELLING
THE DOJ TO LOOK INTO THE
REPORTS OF SURVEILLANCE OF
HIS CAMPAIGN.
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ERIC
SWALWELL JOINS ME TONIGHT.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME
BACK.
>> Martha: THANKS FOR COMING
BACK.
I APPRECIATE IT ONE OF THE
QUESTIONS I HAVE, WHEN JAMES
CLAPPER GOES OUT AND TALKS
ABOUT ALL OF THE CONCERNS
THAT THEY HAD, THAT THERE
WERE CONTACTS AND HE NOW
SAYS HE IS ABSOLUTELY
POSITIVE THAT THE RUSSIANS
SOMEHOW SWUNG THE U.S.
ELECTION, WHY DID THEY NOT?
BECAUSE IT WAS CONSIDERED AT
ONE POINT, ANDREW MCCABE WAS
IN THE ROOM.
JAMES COMEY WAS IN THE ROOM
ACCORDING TO THESE REPORTS.
WHY DID THEY NOT DO WHAT
THEY CALL A DEFENSIVE
BRIEFING IF THEY WERE SO
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE
OF THE ELECTION, WHY DIDN'T
THEY GET IN TOUCH WITH THE
CAMPAIGN AND SAY, LOOK, WE
THINK THEY'RE REACHING OUT
TO YOUR FOLKS?
>> I'M NOT SUGGESTING,
MARTHA, THAT THEY DID
EVERYTHING RIGHT AND THAT'S
WHY I HAVE CALLED FOR AN
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION.
I WROTE LEGISLATION SO WE
CAN TELL THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE, IN PART, WHETHER THE
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE WAS
ADEQUATE.
I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT
THERE WERE MANY RED FLAGS
THAT WERE MISSED AND JUST TO
PUT THIS IN CON TEXAS
THOUGH, DONALD TRUMP WAS
ALSO TELLING THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE THAT THE ELECTION WAS
GOING TO BE RIGGED AND
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS HAVE
ACKNOWLEDGED.
>> Martha: HOW SO?
>> THAT PLAYED INTO THEIR
DECISION AS TO WHETHER TO
TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WHAT THE RUSSIANS WERE
DOING.
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY
INTO THAT FALSE NARRATIVE
DONALD TRUMP WAS PEDDLING.
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS
RIGHT.
THAT WAS THE WRONG CALL ON
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
>> Martha: YOU KNOW, IF
HILLARY CLINTON, WHO SAYS
THAT SHE BELIEVES THAT THE
RUSSIANS STOLE THE ELECTION
FROM HER, THEN SHE MUST BE
PRETTY ANGRY AT THE
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.
AND IF THEY HAD STEPPED IN
AND DONE WHAT THEY, YOU
KNOW, PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE
DONE, WOULDN'T THIS HAVE
GONE DIFFERENT HAVE ANY IT
RAISES THE QUESTION, JAMES
COMEY SAYS HE WANT TO SHARE
THE DOSSIER WITH THE
PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE WAS
GENUINELY CONCERNED THAT IT
COULD BE USED AS SOME SORT
OF COME
OF KOME
OF KOMPROMAT.
WHY DID NOT EARLIER IN THE
PROCESS.
IF THEY WERE CONCERNED THEY
HAD SOMETHING IN THIS
CAMPAIGN OVER THIS
CANDIDATE, IT MAKES NO SENSE
THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
BRIEFED THEM.
>> I AGREE.
>> Martha: ALL RIGHT.
SO WHY DO YOU THINK THEY
DIDN'T?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK AN INDEPENDENT
COMMISSION THOUGH WOULD HAVE
TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO
LATE TO DO IT.
SEPTEMBER 11TH, COMMISSION
WAS ABLE TO ANSWER A LOT OF
THE QUESTIONS LIKE THIS.
THAT COMMISSION WAS NOT PUT
IN PLACE ON SEPTEMBER 12TH.
IT TOOK A YEAR AFTER THE
ATTACK.
THERE IS STILL TIME.
>> Martha: HERE IS WHAT WE
DO KNOW.
JAMES COMEY HAS SAID THAT
THEY WERE CONVINCED THAT
HILLARY CLINTON WAS GOING TO
WIN.
SO, IF THEY'RE CONVINCED
THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS
GOING TO WIN, THEY ARE
TALKING ABOUT HER, THE
INVESTIGATION INTO HER QUITE
OFTEN DURING THE COURSE OF
THIS TIME.
AND, YET, THEY DON'T TALK TO
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ABOUT
WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT
IN THAT CAMPAIGN, IS IT
POSSIBLY BECAUSE THEY WANT
TO KEEP A WINDOW OPEN TO
THAT CAMPAIGN?
THEY HAVE GOT SOME
INTELLIGENCE COMING OUT OF
THAT CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THEY
HAVEN'T MADE THEM AWARE OF
THE FULL SITUATION AND,
PERHAPS, THAT MIGHT BE THE
REASON, DO YOU THINK, THAT
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE
TRANSPARENT WITH THE HEAD OF
THAT CAMPAIGN?
>> NO, THERE ARE
INVESTIGATIVE TACTICS THAT
THE FBI WILL USE TO LEARN
MORE ABOUT WHAT AN ENEMY IS
DOING AS IT INFILTRATES
EITHER AN ORGANIZATION, A
POLITICAL CANDIDATE, ET
CETERA, THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE.
IF THEY WANTED TO TILT THE
ELECTION TOWARD HILLARY
CLINTON, THEY WOULD HAVE
REVEALED THAT THIS
INVESTIGATION WAS UNDERWAY
WHEN IT WAS UNDERWAY.
THAT NEVER CAME OUT U I
THINK THAT SHOWS THAT THEY
MAY HAVE MADE A BAD DECISION
BY NOT TELLING THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN ABOUT THIS --
>> Martha: DON'T YOU THINK
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME TYPE
OF INVESTIGATION INTO HOW
THEY HANDLED THIS?
>> THAT'S WHY I WROTE THE
BILL TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT
COMMISSION, ABSOLUTELY.
>> Martha: IN TERMS OF WHEW,
I WOULD IMAGINE, WOULD LIKE
TO BE IN THAT ROOM DURING
THIS MEETING TOMORROW?
>> WELL, TOMORROW, YES.
BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT IF ANYTHING COMES OUT
OF THAT MEETING, THAT IT IS
ACCURATELY TOLD TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
AND WE HAVE SEEN IN CHAIRMAN
NUNES IN THE PAST WHETHER
UNMASKING CLAIMS OR MEMO
THAT THEY WROTE THERE HAS
BEEN A DISTORTION, TO
PROTECT AGAINST A PERVERSION
OF THE EVIDENCE, YES,
DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE
INVOLVED.
>> Martha: WHY DO YOU THINK
JAMES CLAPPER IS CERTAIN
THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE ABLE
TO THROW THE ELECTION AND
BEFORE WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY
THE DNI HE WASN'T CERTAIN?
>> I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT
THAT'S THE CASE.
I'M CERTAIN THAT THEY
ATTACKED US, THEY WEAPONIZED
SOCIAL MEDIA.
>> THEY TRIED TO HELP DONALD
TRUMP.
UNLESS WE HAD A FULL SCALE
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION,
WE COULDN'T ANSWER THAT
QUESTION.
BUT I THINK IT'S A QUESTION
THAT REPUBLICANS AND
DEMOCRATS WOULD WANT TO KNOW
THE ANSWER TO AND SHOULD
KNOW THE ANSWER.
TO SAY.
>> Martha: ABSOLUTELY.
YOU DON'T THINK THERE WAS
ANY COLLUSION THEN.
>> I DO THINK THERE IS
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.
EVIDENCE IS NOT A
CONCLUSION.
BUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS LET
BOB MUELLER TELL US
CRIMINALLY WHETHER THERE WAS
COLLUSION, WHICH IS
CONSPIRACY TO THE FRAUD TO
THE UNITED STATES.
>> Martha: I UNDERSTAND.
BUT FROM WHAT YOU ARE
SAYING, AS I UNDERSTAND IT,
YOU THINK THAT IT WAS A
MISTAKE FOR JAMES CLAPPER
AND JIM COMEY NOT TO HAVE
GIVEN SOME SORT OF BRIEFING
ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE SEEING
AT THE TIME TO THE CAMPAIGN?
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY
