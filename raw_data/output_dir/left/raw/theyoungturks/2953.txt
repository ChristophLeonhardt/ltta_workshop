1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,190
THERE WAS A

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,250
LIGHTHEARTED, HILARIOUS MOMENT
ON INSIDE THE NBA WITH CHARLES

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,670
BARKLEY WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE
EFFECTS OF TRICKLE-DOWN

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,669
ECONOMICS NOW THAT THERE IS A
NEW TAX CUT.

5
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:10,669
TAKE A LOOK.

6
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:12,139
>>DON'T FORGET ABOUT CHRISTMAS
PRESENTS.

7
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:14,719
>>WE WILL DO THAT ON INSIDE THE
NBA.

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,770
>>THIS WILL BE MY SECOND ONE
THIS WEEK, MY SECOND BIG GIFT.

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,700
>>WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST ONE?

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,990
>>THAT REPUBLICAN TAX CUT.

11
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,600
I WAS
GOING TO SAY, SHAQ, THEY SAID IT

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,610
WOULD TRICKLE-DOWN, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,230
>>YOU WERE ON A ROLL.

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,280
>>I'M GOING TO TRICKLE MY FAT
ASS DOWN TO THE JEWELRY STORE TO

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,880
GET A NEW ROLEX, I'M NOT GOING
TO PASS IT DOWN TO ANYBODY.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,640
THANK YOU, REPUBLICANS.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,940
SORRY
POOR PEOPLE, I'M HOPING FOR YOU

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,499
ALL BUT Y'ALL AIN'T GOT NO
CHANCE.

19
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:57,890
>>THAT'S WHY I LOVE CHARLES
BARKLEY.

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:07,610
>>THEY DIDN'T EVEN RECONSTITUTE
TRICKLE-DOWN IN THE PITCH, IT'S

21
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:13,270
BEEN PROVEN WRONG FOR DECADES
BUT STILL YOU HEAR IT, IT'S THE

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:18,070
WAY. AND CHARLES BARKLEY,
HASHTAG TRUTH.

23
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,260
>>IT'S BECOME A PUNCHLINE AND
THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE IT.

24
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,260
THAT

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,420
IS WHY THIS BILL IS POLLING AT
AROUND 30%, WHICH IS IN CREDIT

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,020
WE UNPOPULAR.

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,110
AND BARKLEY WAS A
REPUBLICAN FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE

28
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,040
UNTIL GEORGE W. BUSH,
SIGNIFICANTLY INTO BUSH'S

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,350
FIRST TERM.

30
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,780
WHEN HE WAS ASKED
BACK IN THE DAY WHY ARE YOU A

31
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,800
REPUBLICAN, HE SAID HIS
GRANDMOTHER ASKED HIM, HIS

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,140
GRANDMOTHER SAID CHARLES, WHY
ARE YOU A REPUBLICAN?

33
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,140
THEY ARE

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,140
ONLY FOR THE RICH.

35
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,110
HE'S LIKE,
GRANDMA, I AM RICH.

36
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,110
AND DURING

37
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,970
THE BUSH ERA THE ASKED HIM WHAT
IS YOUR PROBLEM, YOU WERE ALWAYS

38
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:05,090
PRO BEING RICH -- HE'S LIKE,
YEAH, I WAS WITH THE REPUBLICANS

39
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,679
UNTIL THEY WENT NUTS AND LOST
THEIR MINDS.

40
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,679
BY THE WAY, THE

41
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,679
SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME.

42
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:12,970
WE
ARE GOING TO IRAQ?

43
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,970
TORCHING

44
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,970
PEOPLE?

45
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,560
OKAY, CHARLES WANTS
ANOTHER ROLEX BUT DOESN'T WANT

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,920
YOU TO TORTURE ANYONE ABOUT IT.

47
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,090
HERE HE'S BEING LIGHTHEARTED AS

48
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,640
BRETT SAID BUT HE DRIVES THE
POINT HOME.

49
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
YOU AREN'T GOING TO

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,880
GET ANYTHING, BUT CHARLES
BARKLEY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE

51
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,280
RICH REPUBLICAN DONORS WILL GET
ROLEXES AND YACHTS AND IT ISN'T

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:00:00,000
GOING TO TRICKLE DOWN ON YOU
EXCEPT IN THE WAY YOU IMAGINE.
