1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,350
A POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE HAS STRUCK
A TOWN NEAR MEXICO CITY AND SO

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,629
FAR, AS OF THIS MOMENT, THE
DEATH TOLL HAS REACHED 100

3
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:11,669
PEOPLE.

4
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:15,829
IT WAS A MAGNITUDE 7.1
EARTHQUAKE AND WE DO HAVE SOME

5
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:20,240
FOOTAGE THAT WE WILL TOSS TO
RIGHT NOW AS B ROLL WHILE I GIVE

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,640
YOU MORE DETAILS ON WHAT'S GOING
ON.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,950
THESE VIDEOS WERE ACTUALLY
SHARED TO US BY A VIEWER BY THE

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,810
NAME OF JORGE, SO I
WANT TO THANK HIM FOR SHARING

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,900
THIS WITH US.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,469
THAT IS A SCENE FEATURING PEOPLE
ON THESE TOURIST BOATS AND YOU

11
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:40,640
CAN ALSO SEE SOME DAMAGE THERE,
THE HIGHWAYS ARE DESTROYED.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,350
THERE ARE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE
BEEN DESTROYED.

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,429
DURING THE QUAKE, MORE THAN
20 BUILDINGS AND OTHER

14
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:47,999
STRUCTURES FELL, INCLUDING AT
LEAST TWO SCHOOLS, OFFICIAL

15
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:50,699
SAID, CRUSHING CARS AND TRAPPING
SOME PEOPLE INSIDE.

16
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,719
IT ALSO CAME LESS THAN TWO
WEEKS AFTER THE MOST POWERFUL

17
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,739
EARTHQUAKE IN MEXICO IN A
CENTURY, A MAGNITUDE 8.1

18
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:58,239
QUAKE THAT KILLED AT LEAST 90

19
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,079
PEOPLE, DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF
HOMES AND WAS FELT BY TENS

20
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,129
OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN MEXICO
AND IN GUATEMALA.

21
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,000
THE INCREDIBLE THING IS THAT
THIS EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED ON

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,410
THE ANNIVERSARY OF A HUGE
EARTHQUAKE THAT OCCURRED IN

23
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,780
MEXICO CITY IN 1985.

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,530
IT KILLED AS MANY AS 10,000
PEOPLE IN MEXICO, SO THERE WERE

25
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,690
INDIVIDUALS DOING EARTHQUAKE
DRILLS AS THIS QUAKE HIT WHICH

26
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,900
IS AMAZING AND IT'S ALSO
DEVASTATING.

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,340
ALL OF THESE NATURAL
DISASTERS ARE STRIKING AT ONCE

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,280
AND PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR
HOMES, THEY ARE LOSING

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,510
THEIR LIVES, AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO SAY ABOUT IT

30
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,440
OTHER THAN IT IS SO INCREDIBLY
DEPRESSING.

31
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,060
THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS
THAT GO INTO IT BECAUSE

32
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,930
WE'RE BOTH FROM THE VALLEY AND
WE LIVED TO THE NORTHRIDGE

33
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,050
EARTHQUAKE IN 1994 AND THAT WAS
A 6.8 EARTHQUAKE.

34
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,740
THE THING TO KNOW ABOUT THE
RICHTER SCALE IS

35
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,140
EXPONENTIAL NOT LINEAR SO THE
BIGGER IT IS, OVER A

36
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,020
NUMBER, IT ACTUALLY GETS
EXPONENTIALLY LARGER SO A

37
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,370
7.1 QUAKE IS MUCH STRONGER THAN
A 6.8 QUAKE.

38
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,020
ANOTHER ASPECT OF IT THAT GOES
INTO CONSIDERATION IS THE

39
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,730
TIME OF DAY.

40
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,720
THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE WAS A
431 IN THE MORNING AND PEOPLE

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,569
WERE IN THEIR HOMES AS OPPOSED
TO EARTHQUAKES LIKE THIS ONE AND

42
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,871
THEN THERE WAS ONE IN SAN
FRANCISCO IN THE 80S DURING A

43
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:19,670
WORLD SERIES GAMES ARE PEOPLE
ARE OUT AND ABOUT AND EACH

44
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,170
SITUATION BRINGS ITS OWN DANGER
IS NOT TO MENTION THE LOCATION

45
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,290
AND THE KIND OF, WHAT'S
UNDERNEATH THE CITY AND WHERE

46
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,140
CITY IS BUILT SO WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT MEXICO CITY AND

47
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,910
EARTHQUAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
MORE AFRAID, THERE HAD BEEN

48
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,970
REPORTS FROM THE PREVIOUS
EARTHQUAKE WERE FOLKS, EVEN

49
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,120
THOUGH THAT WAS OFF THE COAST TO
THE SOUTH, PEOPLE FELT IN MEXICO

50
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,840
CITY AND OUT OF FEAR, THEY DID
WITH THEY DO IN MEXICO CITY

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,120
WHICH IS MORE OFTEN, RUN INTO
THE STREET BECAUSE UNDERNEATH

52
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,720
MEXICO CITY, A LOT OF IT IS
BUILT ON THE LAKEBED AS A POSTER

53
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,890
HARD BEDROCK WHICH LENDS ITSELF
MORE TO STABLE CONSTRUCTION.

54
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,960
THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS THAT GO
INTO IT.

55
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,940
YOU SEE THEM ALL PLAY OUT AT
ONCE AND IT INCREASES THE

56
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,990
DEVASTATION, NOT TO MENTION ALL
THE COLLATERAL ISSUES LIKE

57
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,190
GAS LEAKS AND MAYBE TRIGGERED,
BUYERS, BUILDINGS THAT

58
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,780
DEPENDING ON WHEN THEY WERE
CREATED AND BUILT ARE

59
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,240
ENGINEERED TO WITHSTAND

60
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,110
LIKE THIS OR NOT AND THEN
YOU'LL SEE DIFFERENT

61
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,280
POCKETS THAT JUST RANDOMLY
SUFFERED MORE DEVASTATION THAN

62
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,190
OTHERS BASED ON THE GEOLOGICAL
UNDERPINNINGS OF THAT SITE.

63
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,190
EXACTLY.

64
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,599
UNFORTUNATELY, THE DEATH TOLL
IS EXPECTED TO RISE AS THE

65
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,050
STORY DEVELOPS.

66
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,800
THIS EARTHQUAKE DID STRIKE
TODAY IN THE AFTERNOON AND SO

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,030
OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE PRELIMINARY
REPORTS.

68
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,610
WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION,
OR DETAILS AS THE STORY

69
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,200
DEVELOPS, BUT IT'S AMAZING.

70
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,590
LAST NIGHT THERE WAS AN
EARTHQUAKE IN LOS ANGELES.

71
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,220
IT WAS SMALL.

72
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,330
NO DAMAGE, NO DUST, NO NOTHING
BUT WERE SEEING THESE

73
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,130
NATURAL DISASTERS OVER THE PLACE
RIGHT NOW AND IT'S CONCERNING.

74
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,490
OBVIOUSLY THERE CAUSED BY
DIFFERENT THINGS.

75
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,650
ALSO PSYCHOLOGICALLY, IT
SEEMS LIKE IT ALL IS

76
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,520
HAPPENING AT ONCE AND THE EFFECT
THAT THAT HAS ON EVERYBODY.

77
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,890
ALSO, THE AFTERSHOCKS SO THIS
IS NOT THE ONLY QUAKE THAT

78
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,140
WILL HAPPEN.

79
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,130
THIS CAME TWO WEEKS AFTER THE
MOST RECENT QUAKE AND THEN

80
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,480
WHEN THERE IS ANY KIND OF
EARTHQUAKE, THE IMMEDIATELY

81
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,820
THING YOU THINK OF IS THIS A
FORESHOCK OR THE MAIN EVENT?

82
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,690
IF IT'S A 7.1
EARTHQUAKE IMMEDIATELY ALL THE

83
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,880
SEISMOLOGISTS SAY THERE MIGHT BE
A LARGE ONE JUST AROUND THE

84
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,530
CORNER BUT EVEN IF THERE'S NOT,
I REMEMBER DURING THE NORTHRIDGE

85
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,530
QUAKE, 5.5 EARTHQUAKES WERE THE
NORM FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

86
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,120
I REMEMBERED THAT WE WERE
SITTING OUTSIDE IN THE

87
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
FRONT YARD.

88
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,040
WE HAD A FRIENDS RV DOWN THE
STREET MAKING HOT CHOCOLATE

89
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,290
FOR EVERYBODY.

90
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,540
HEART GOES OUT TO EVERYONE IN
MEXICO IS AFFECTED BY THIS AND

91
00:04:42,540 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WILL KEEP YOU GUYS UPDATED ON
THE STORY AS IT DEVELOPS.
