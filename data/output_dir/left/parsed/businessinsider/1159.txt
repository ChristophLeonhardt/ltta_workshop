at least weekly they should be put in a
drying cycle that is hot which will
absolutely kill the dust mite the
detergents will probably kill it but the
heat will definitely kill us well it
depends on what's in your bedroom but
most of the time human skin cells
subsequent dust mite occasional mold
spores and animal danders even if you
don't have an animal we always absorb it
it comes on our clothes in the workplace
and I'll keep the room that you sleep
sort of like the Swedish style very
little carpeting not too cluttered no
stuffed animals very few plants if
possible and that will go a long way in
helping you
