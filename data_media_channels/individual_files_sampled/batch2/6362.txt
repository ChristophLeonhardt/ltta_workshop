so I've been telling you for a long time but Glenn Beck's site the blaze is in trouble that's because I'm good at math and I know that his numbers don't add up I'm also in digital media and giving me further context into how preposterous his claims were that he was running a profitable business so obviously he lined back left Fox News started the blaze and and said that you know things were going great and put a lot of money into it a lot of people put a lot of money into it and it looks like they're having a wee bit of trouble and we have wonderful rich details for you guys literally in this case today and the Daily Brief breaks his story Glenn Beck they explain the enigmatic conservative media firebrand appears to be selling off his assets as his media enterprise downsizes betsy Woodruff and max tani reporting on that okay no one's surprised by this I told you they were having trouble and they started laying off a lot of people in fact let's talk about that a little bit but what they're selling off is the fun part earlier this year Beck engaged in conversations with popular right-wing pundit ben shapiro to buy or partner with Beck's right-leaning news network the blaze which has been hit with several rounds of massive layoffs over the past three years now those layoffs are gonna be very relevant in a second now I don't know if you're wondering how the hell can Ben Shapiro for the blaze as much of financial trouble there and no for conservatives is usually very very wealthy people who are not actually looking to make a profit who financed a lot of this stuff so like the Merces for example Robert Mercer Rebecca Mercer finance Breitbart never turned a profit never gonna turn a profit it's they're not in it for the capitalism they're in it for the marketing in the propaganda so I don't know who's behind Shapiro and who could possibly buy the blaze that's an interesting story for another day but right now let's look at what he's selling off Beck's opulent spending habits have been a source of consternation at his media empire employees at the blaze previously lamented that Beck bought a Maybach sedan and kept jedd his private jet which was expensive to operate and maintain you don't say amid massive layoffs of the company in 2015 I such a bad guy alright now let me show you what a Maybach looks like in case you haven't seen it and I haven't I might have seen the outside and that's rare but I certainly haven't seen the inside and that's a lovely looking car I like that the base model starts at one hundred and sixty eight thousand do you get leather seats with 168,000 or do you have to upgrade for that is there is it roll down Windows or is a power windows at one hundred and sixty eight thousand dollars that is a pretty looking car now that's not necessarily Glenn Beck's car but Glenn's bikes cars a Maybach and it looks something like that okay and then he has a private jet and again this is not exactly his private jet but this is the kind of private jet that he owns it's a similar model okay must be nice this what is that champagne or wine in the middle there very very nice I don't love that particular color but I'm sure Trump would feel at home alright so that's what he's doing he once wrote a couple of years back to his daughter these are moving words private jet travel is the only material thing that can actually change her life mmm agree to disagree a lot of things I can change your life and I'd start a little bit lower than private jet travel I don't think that's the only thing that could materially change your life preposterous what I didn't same thing to say I mean you don't want to travel with a rival even in first-class okay well it looks like they're not going to have a private jet anymore so I guess his life has been materially changed for the worse I don't know how the Beck family's gonna make it through this now here comes the worst part the jet was purchased by Beck's radio company Mercury Radio arts that same year in 2015 from right-wing billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife for a million dollars the year he's doing layoffs presumably I mean I don't know if he has a courage to actually do it himself but presumably people come into his office he's our man we're on a tough time sorry about that maybe we gotta let you go hope you know you could find another job it happens it happens in the world right sometimes you're on really tight times it's awesome we can't afford your salary anymore 40,000 50,000 60,000 whatever's we can't afford it anymore then he turns around and lasts give me a million dollars to buy the Richard Mellon Scaife private jet cuz his life has to be materially changed for the better your life that's a different story but he bought it with the company's money look Oprah one-seventh jet LeBron James on seven Chad Bill Gates wants to have a chat over fly around the world and they pay for it I don't begrudge that man a lot of people uh probably she's already Limbaugh has a private jet I never talked about Rush Limbaugh's private jet but you're gonna use company money and a million bucks so you don't have to fly first-class so you don't have to fly first-class so you get a private jet meanwhile you're doing rounds of layoffs gee I wonder what his priorities are I can't quite tell so could it be that his crazy spending is what led to some of the blazes troubles hmm look fine let me say this grand Beck is insane and I think he's clinical we talked about this before he wants to clear that he was now saying that he had mental issues in the past but he's now saying why because he said he strapped himself to a gyroscope and went round and around like Sandra Bullock and gravity and he said that cured him I Got News for you it didn't that's not a thing that doesn't cure any kind of mental disease that's what his quack doctor told him and that's what he believed so that's three guys on the right that I think are clinical Glenn Beck for certain Alex Jones for certain and I would argue Donald Trump so why do right-wingers love insane leaders there is a real reason you know why because conservatives are authoritarian by Nature they want to follow a strong leader who are strong leaders insane people you know why they're resolute I know what I'm doing the gyroscope cured me the fonts are gay and you're human gorillas pink hybrids I'm positive of it I'm positive of it all right Donald Trump I'm the only one who can save you they're all of these things are coming but me me me me they are absolutely certain why because they're not smart smart people reflect and they think that could be right that could be wrong let's test it out what are our different options insane people think they have the whole world figured out and when in reality they don't know anything but they sound strong confident and resolute exactly what conservatives follow it is so sad and unlikely in a couple of years we will at least in two out of three of those cases have literal clinical reports in that's my best guess of of them saying yet no they had mental issues they had legitimate significant mental issues Beck said he already had him in the past but the gyroscope cured him no one in their right mind actually believes that does anyone think Alex Jones the same and when you find out any rational person when you find out the guy that you've been following your whole life and thought was awesome was actually insane the whole time oh that's gonna leave a mark if you liked this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came
