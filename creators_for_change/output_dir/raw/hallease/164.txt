00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,070
Hey guys!

2
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:06,967
I'm here today to show y'all how I do my regimen

3
00:00:07,353 --> 00:00:08,393
for the summer.

4
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:13,649
As you can see I just came back from the gym and I have my in like a roll tuck pomp thing

5
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:20,786
I've been wearing my hair like this, for like...around..two or three days I think.

6
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:26,774
It's about that time to wash the hair and get it clean.

7
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:32,103
To wash my hair I only use the Terressentials Mudwash

8
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:35,169
I've been using using it now on and off, I think about a year and a half.

9
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:39,142
And I love it! It's all my hair usually needs to get clean and feel moisturized.

10
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:42,248
So, when I get into the shower

11
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:49,471
I just take the time to really let the water get into my hair and penetrate my hair.

12
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:55,479
I usually will stand under the shower for at least like 5 minutes or so to just really make sure

13
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:59,294
the water is penetrating all of my hair

14
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:01,345
and i'm really getting it into every part.

15
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:06,904
Because my hair is so dense, it can really take a while and I have low porosity hair as well.

16
00:01:08,387 --> 00:01:13,907
So, it really takes a lot of work to just get the water into my hair to nourish my hair

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,930
and moisturize my hair.

18
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:24,682
From there I take about an ounce of the mudwash and fill up about a 5 oz applicator bottle with water.

19
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:29,452
Shake it, and use that diluted mudwash to then penetrate to my scalp

20
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:33,765
This is where the applicator bottle really comes in handy

21
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:37,571
because once again it helps get through the thickness of my hair to my scalp

22
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:40,851
and actually get the mudwash there to clense my scalp.

23
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:46,983
And I do this throughout my whole head, taking the balls of my fingers and really working it in.

24
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:08,470
So from there I take a little bit extra mudwash about a quarter size amount for front and back of my hair

25
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:12,041
and work that into the shafts of my hair.

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,080
The applicator bottle mudwash was just mostly for my scalp

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,077
and now taking the mudwash without any dilution

28
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:23,172
I can work it into the rest of my hair, and get it on my ends

29
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:26,063
and also finger detangle and remove shed hairs.

30
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:30,674
I always put my shed hairs on the wall of the shower

31
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:33,955
so that way I don't end up clogging my bathroom drain.

32
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:37,007
I also have a little drain prevention clog thing!

33
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:44,446
So here's the finished product, as you can see

34
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:50,857
the mudwash is already starting to define my curls really well and hydrate and moisturize my hair

35
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:54,424
At this point I'll usually finish washing the rest of my body

36
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,819
while I leave the mudwash in my hair for about the 5 to 10 minutes

37
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,887
that it takes to like wash myself and shave and all that jazz

38
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:17,492
And once I'm getting towards the end I usually give myself another good scalp massage to break up

39
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:20,966
any debris and buildup and also just work in the mudwash that much more.

40
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:27,666
So now I rinse everything out and I usually try to use the weight of the water

41
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:32,158
to try and get any remaining shed hairs and also to just

42
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,644
really make sure that my hair is nice and moisturized

43
00:03:35,726 --> 00:03:42,526
I'll very lightly pull my hair apart to help separate and detangle everything without being too harsh

44
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:43,026
on my hair

45
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,640
Look how long my hair is under the water guys! It's ridiculous...

46
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,905
It's ridiculous because when you see the finished product you're gonna be like

47
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:55,751
"Her hair is so short!"

48
00:03:57,454 --> 00:04:00,254
But its not! It's like 10 inches all around

49
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:00,754
But...

50
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:03,227
just wait until you see the shrinkage though...

51
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,356
It's just so stupid...

52
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:06,706
How much the shrinkage is..

53
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:08,843
But hey! That makes it awesome!

54
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:10,867
At this point, if the spirit moves you

55
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:13,707
You can turn the shower to the cool setting

56
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,559
and close down those cuticles!

57
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:23,715
I do NOT do this very often, only when the spirit moves me to do it.

58
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:34,727
And there is my shed hair

59
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:38,740
It's been about 3 or 4 days since I've washed my hair - which his the longest I usually go.

60
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,484
So there's quite a bit of shed hair.

61
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,529
So here's my hair out of the shower

62
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:54,448
completely wet

63
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,787
...just to give you an idea...

64
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:00,543
[singing] Isn't she lovely!

65
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:06,994
And then I take my turban twist and

66
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:08,141
you know...microfiber..blah blah blah

67
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:08,641
...hair breakage, whatever!

68
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,400
And wrap my hair in that

69
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
And while its in the turban twist

70
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,260
I go and I get dressed!

71
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,460
So i'm back!

72
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,980
How y'all doin!

73
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,647
I moisturized my skkkiinn!

74
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:28,991
Put on some deodorant...all that good stuff.

75
00:05:29,464 --> 00:05:32,484
Take off the turban twist

76
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:35,824
so we can see what we got under here.

77
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,900
Alright...

78
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,844
My hair is about 50% dry, the turban twist does a pretty good job

79
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,230
of getting all of the excess water off of my hair.

80
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:46,982
Which is cool!

81
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:51,082
So uh here's like the 50% dry twist around...

82
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:53,009
or not...

83
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,152
or I could just shake - that works too...

84
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:58,557
I'm forgetting how I edited the video so...

85
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,600
Y'know...here we go!

86
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,416
There's the twist

87
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:02,645
turn

88
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:06,239
[singing with random melody] 360 degrees of the 50% dry

89
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,420
You can see how the back seems shorter than the mid section

90
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,520
But that's just because the curl pattern is that much tighter

91
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,742
And here's the finished product!

92
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,550
Here is after about 2 hours...mmmm...NO! Like 2 or  3 hours later

93
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:22,306
when its completely dry.

94
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,340
Once again, I do this regimen about 2 to 3 times a week

95
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,770
depending on how active I am.

96
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,525
And that is all I do with my hair guys!

97
00:06:31,780 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you when I see you!
