IS.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH TONIGHT.
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP LOOMS LARGE
OVER TOMORROW NIGHT'S PRIMARY AS
PRETTY MUCH DOCUMENTED BY THE
RED HAT, NEW BOOK IS ASKING
REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE 2016 WIN
WAS IT JUST A FLUKE AS SOME
PUNDITS HAVE INDICATED OR DOES
IT REPRESENT A FUNDAMENTAL
ELECTORAL SHIFT IN OUR NATION'S
POLITICS THAT COULD IMPACT
TOMORROW NIGHT'S ELECTION AND
PERHAPS ALL OF AMERICAN POLITICS
FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.
THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE GREAT
REVOLT INSIDE THE POPULIST
COALITION RESHAPING AMERICAN
POLITICS" AUTHORS JOINING ME
NOW.
YOU DOCUMENTED 2016 IN-DEPTH
PICKING UP ON SOME OF THESE
TRENDS BEFORE THEY REALLY
SURFACED ON ELECTION NIGHT.
SURPRISED LOT OF PEOPLE.
LET ME ASK YOU FIRST.
AS YOU LISTEN TO THAT DISCUSSION
ABOUT THESE PRIMARIES TONIGHT,
THIS IS WHAT'S BREWING.
WHAT IS YOUR HANDLE ON WHAT
MIGHT HAPPEN BASED ON WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN SEEING?
>> I THINK IT'S REALLY
INTERESTING.
BRAD AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT
THIS BEFORE WE WENT ON.
EVERYONE TRYING TO GRAB THE
MANTLE OF THE DONALD TRUMP
CANDIDATE.
THEY'RE TRYING TO PICK UP
PORTIONS THAT THEY THINK THEY
REFLECT THE MOST.
THAT TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT THE
ELECTORATE.
IT'S STILL SORT OF UNSETTLED.
IT IS STILL AGAINST THE STATUS
QUO AND IT IS INTERESTED IN
DISRUPTING WHAT'S GOING ON IN
ELECTIONS.
IT'S NOT WILLING TO LISTEN TO
WHAT WASHINGTON IS TELLING THEM.
>> IF YOU LISTEN TO THE FOLKS ON
THE LIBERAL SIDE OF THE FENCE,
THEY THINK THIS PRESIDENCY IS A
DISASTER.
THEY THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A
HUGE BLUE WAVE COMING.
IS WHAT YOU GUYS DOCUMENT IN
THIS BOOK, SOMETHING THAT WILL
CONTINUE TO IMPACT THESE
POLITICS.
ARE THEY RIGHT OR YOU GUYS
RIGHT?
>> YOU SEE IN THE OHIO
GOVERNOR'S RACE, TWO DEMOCRATS
MIGHT BE DESCRIBED NUTTIER.
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN RADICALIZED
IN THIS PROCESS.
THE REASON OUR BOOK, IF YOU
DIDN'T SEE THE TRUMP WAVE
COMING, IF YOU DIDN'T SEE
POPULIST AND CONSERVATIVES WHICH
CHANGED THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY
AND CHANGE THE COALITION.
THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU.
IT'S CONTINUED ON IN COMMERCIAL.
THE NFL, DICK'S SPORTING GOODS.
COMMERCE IS BEING DISRUPTED BY
THE SAME COALITION.
>> IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU WOULD
THINK THAT WEST VIRGINIA IS
GOING TO BE BECOME RED.
IT MAY NOT.
MANCHIN IS VERY POPULAR IN HIS
HOME STATE.
>> IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO
SORT OUT AT THIS POINT.
I WOULD SAY LOOK MAYBE IN AUGUST
AND SEPTEMBER.
SEE WHAT KIND OF CAMPAIGNS
THEY'RE RUNNING AND WHAT THEY
ARE SAYING IS APPEALING TO
VOTERS.
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE
ECONOMY.
THEY STILL WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THE ECONOMY AND HOW THEY'RE
TREATED WITH RESPECT.
THIS IS A CULTURE THAT FEELS IT
NOT BEEN RESPECTED.
NOT JUST POLITICS BUT BY BIG
BUSINESS AND SPORT.
THEIR IMPACT IS WELL BEYOND THE
BALLOT BOX.
THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE
READ THE BOOK.
I THINK THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THERE'S A MOVEMENT GOING ON.
WE'RE STILL NOT LISTENING TO
WHAT ITS TELLING US.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M CURIOUS
ABOUT.
WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE --
DEVICIVENESS IN THE COUNTRY.
YOU SEE THE RIGHT GOING FURTHER
RIGHT.
AND YOU SEE LEFT.
YOU SEE THIS TRUMP PHENOMENON.
YOU GOT LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE
MIDDLE WHO SORT OF WANT TO GO
BACK TO WHERE THINGS WERE.
I THINK MOST REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATES WHO MAYBE LIKE THAT
MIDDLE ZONE.
HOW DO YOU SEE THAT?
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THREE
PARTIES?
>> WE DID A SURVEY OF TRUMP
VOTERS IN THE FIVE STATES THAT
FLIPPED FROM OBAMA TO TRUMP.
BY FAR, 89% OF THEM BLAMED BOTH
PARTIES.
73% SAY BIG BUSINESSES CAN'T BE
TRUSTED.
THERE'S A POPULOUS FUSION THAT
SAY BIG GOVERNMENT BIG BUSINESS,
WE'RE WAITING TO SEE.
HUGE NUMBER OF TRUMP VOTERS IN
OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA AND IOWA
AND WISCONSIN, THOSE VOTERS
VOTED FOR OBAMA TWICE.
THEY DIDN'T GET WHAT THEY WANTED
FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA.
THEY WERE WILLING TO BREAK
PARTING TRADITIONS TO SWITCH.
WE HAVE A STORY IN THE BOOK.
YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE
THOUGHT PROCESS HOW PEOPLE CAN
SWITCH FROM BARACK OBAMA TO
DONALD TRUMP.
THIS THE POOK FOR BUT YOU
>> WHAT ABOUT NOVEMBER YOU
HEARING THERE'S BIG BLUE WAVE
COMING.
THE POLLS HAVE SHOWN TO BE
UNRELIABLE.
DO YOU BELIEVE THE POLLS?
>> WELL, I THINK POLLSTER HAVE A
HARD TIME WITH TALKING TO
PEOPLE.
IT'S PART OF A DISTRUST.
PEOPLE DON'T TRUST TO GIVE THEIR
INFORMATION TO POLLSTERS.
THAT'S PART OF IT.
I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE AREN'T
HONEST WHEN THEY'RE POLLED.
I THINK NOVEMBER, WHEN I'M GOING
TO BE WATCHING ARE THE SENATE
RACES.
THERE ARE TEN SEATS THAT WERE
HELD BY DEMOCRATS THAT TRUMP
WON.
NOT IN THE SMALL WAY.
TAKE MISSOURI.
>> FIVE STATES DEMOCRATS
INCUMBENTS HOLD THAT ARE UP FOR
REELECTION.
BMW
--W
-- BMW
-- DMW
-- DONALD TRUMP WON BY 18
POINTS.
>> WE'LL SEE LOT OF THOSE IN
ACTION TOMORROW NIGHT.
WHICH MAKES THIS A REALLY
INTERESTING ELECTION NIGHT.
IT'S VERY INTERESTING.
