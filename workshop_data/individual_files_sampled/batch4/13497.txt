so while this monster was roamings classroom to classroom with his rifle mowing down students for deputies four armed uniformed deputies we're sitting outside then get in there try and save the kids then together try and rescue the kids after he's been shot they waited for an entirely new Police Department to get there and go inside there's something fishy going on here folks there is something going on here because that I promise you when people sign up to be sheriff's deputies they're not doing so thinking that they're gonna cower behind a car they're doing so thinking that they want to help save people so there's something going on and this thing Steve Israel knows the answer and he ain't telling us Steve Israel this Canada Sheriff he knows exactly what happened here and he is not telling us there's a rumor online that I hesitate to report because I don't know that it's well substantiated this has more to do with sheriff's policy than anything else but we're gonna find out because something happened here where four deputies were sitting outside with their guns drawn and a monster inside massacring children and they didn't go inside they're gonna told me that's the NRA his fault they're gonna tell that's Dana lashes fault you're gonna tell me that's my fault living in Los Angeles and my guns in my safe you're gonna tell me that's the fault of a hundred million gun owners who weren't there many of whom would have rushed the shooter and tried to do something just like what happened in the in the Texas Church shooting where an armed citizen took down the bad guy that guy who's just an armed citizens and a hell of a lot more than any of these cops did in Broward County this is insanity and I'll tell you something that's even more insane here's something that's even more insane again remember just a couple of days ago it was this schmuck Steve Israel who's standing on stage amidst a bunch of the citizens from Broward County and shouting at Dana lash and telling aunt Dana lash that it was her fault that all this had happened that it was the NRA s fault that all this has happened Virtue's signaling and posturing about how we just need to get guns out of the hands of bad people well the guns were in the hands of the right people but they didn't do a damn thing according to CNN is the worst law enforcement failure in modern American history seventeen dead people because there are cops waiting outside who didn't go in there so here's here's the case you're making to me Steve Israel here's the case you're making to me Barack Obama here's the case you're making to me all the folks in the media on the left in the case you're making to me today is the FBI failed twice to do anything about this school shooter and then the Broward County Sheriff's Office failed 39 times to do anything about that shooter and then there were armed people from the Broward County Sheriff's Office there four of them apparently and they didn't do anything about the shooter and I'm supposed to hand over my gun to you I'm supposed to hand over my ability to defend myself to you why in why in blue blazing hell would I do that why would I hand over my only ability to protect myself to people who are going to stand outside with the guns that I gave up and not rush the shooter again the people in the media are just it Scott is there a lot Stephen Israel rather the the people in the the the people in the media have been attempting to spin away from this story all day now it's even worse obviously because it's not just one officer it's for the way they've been spinning away from this so lawrence o'donnell was the worst lawrence O'Donnell last night goes on TV and he says how can you expect one man to charge into the line of fire even if he's wearing a uniform I love these same people who say that the cops are racists the cops are pathetic we shouldn't trust the cops we can never trust the cops and now all of a sudden they're the big defenders of cops they only like cops when cops don't actually do anything apparently
