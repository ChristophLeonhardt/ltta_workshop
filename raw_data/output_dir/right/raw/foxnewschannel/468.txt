1
00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:09,247
>> THE HE TIRE NATION HAS

2
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:12,684
WITNESSED THE SHAMELESS CONDUCT

3
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:16,755
OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY.

4
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:19,891
THEY ARE WILLING TO THROW AWAY

5
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:21,927
EVERY STANDARD OF DECENCY,

6
00:00:21,927 --> 00:00:23,495
JUSTICE, FAIRNESS AND DUE

7
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:25,597
PROCESS TO GET THEIR WAY.

8
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:28,233
THEY DON'T CARE HOW THEY GET IT.

9
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,201
YOU SEE IT HAPPENING BEFORE YOUR

10
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:30,635
EYES.

11
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:33,405
I THINK IT'S' AN INCREDIBLE

12
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:34,406
THING THAT'S HAPPENING.

13
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:36,274
I HOPE YOU DON'T SIT HOME

14
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:37,509
BECAUSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN

15
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:39,778
IF YOU SIT HOME.

16
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:40,912
JUDGE JEANINE: PRESIDENT TRUMP

17
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:43,582
DOUBLES DOWN ON THE DEMOCRATS IN

18
00:00:43,582 --> 00:00:44,950
TONIGHT'S RALLY IN WEST

19
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,317
VIRGINIA.

20
00:00:45,317 --> 00:00:46,918
ONE OF THOSE REPUBLICANS RUNNING

21
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:50,555
IS HOUSE INTEL CHAIRMAN DEVIN

22
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:52,490
NUNES WHO IS BACK WITH ME IN

23
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,394
PART TWO OF THIS "JUSTICE"

24
00:00:56,394 --> 00:00:57,295
EXCLUSIVE.

25
00:00:57,295 --> 00:00:58,997
CHAIRMAN NUNES YOU WERE THE

26
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:01,099
TOPIC OF A LOT OF HEADLINES AND

27
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:03,435
DISCUSSION ON TELEVISION AS IT

28
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:05,604
RELATED TO THE MEMO AND

29
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:06,605
INVESTIGATION OF THE FISA

30
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:07,038
WARRANT.

31
00:01:07,038 --> 00:01:08,707
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS GOING

32
00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:10,942
TO DECLASSIFY THE INFORMATION

33
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:11,810
RELATING TO THAT.

34
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,179
AND I MUST TELL YOU PERSONALLY

35
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:15,814
EVERYONE I SPOKE TO ACROSS THE

36
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:19,618
COUNTRY WANTS THIS DECLASSIFIED.

37
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:21,920
DECLASSIFY IT, NO REDACTION.

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,822
HE SAID I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO

39
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:25,190
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL.

40
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,291
WHAT HAPPENED?

41
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,959
>> I'M GUESSING MANY PEOPLE WHO

42
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,028
DON'T WANT THIS OUT WENT TO THE

43
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:31,930
WHITE HOUSE AND HAD A SHEETING

44
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,398
AND TOLD THE PRESIDENT A LOT OF

45
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:35,667
THINGS THAT WEREN'T TRUE LIKE

46
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,669
OUR ALLIES DON'T WANT THIS OUT

47
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:40,472
WHICH IS A RIDICULOUS TAPE.

48
00:01:40,472 --> 00:01:42,340
HOW WOULD THE ALLIES EVEN KNOW

49
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,908
WHAT'S IN A FISA WARRANT.

50
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:45,644
I THINK THE PRESIDENT GOT

51
00:01:45,644 --> 00:01:47,412
SPOOKED ON THIS.

52
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:48,747
HE'LL TURN IT OVER TO HAVE THE I

53
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:54,085
AM G. LOOK AT IT.

54
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:55,920
-- WE WORKED SO HARD TO GET

55
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,356
THIS INFORMATION OUT TO THE

56
00:01:58,356 --> 00:01:59,557
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

57
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:02,627
WE WANT FULL TRANSPARENCY.

58
00:02:02,627 --> 00:02:05,030
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS THIS

59
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,032
GETS TO THE UNDERSTAND POLICY

60
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:09,366
THAT REMEMBER STRZOK AND PAGE

61
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,935
WERE TALKING ABOUT?

62
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:14,239
WE BELIEVE THIS WAS THE

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,408
UNDERSTAND POLICY.

64
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:18,043
AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE SAYING IT

65
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:20,645
WASN'T THE DOSSIER IT WASN'T THE

66
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:22,047
DOSSIER THAT WAS USED.

67
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:24,282
AND IT WASN'T THE FAKE NEWS

68
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:25,183
STORY.

69
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:27,686
IT'S ALL THAT STUFF BEHIND THE

70
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:28,787
REDACTION.

71
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:30,655
WHAT'S BEHIND THOSE REDACTIONS

72
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:34,259
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NEED TO

73
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,927
KNOW ABOUT.

74
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:37,362
JUDGE JEANINE: THEY ARE WORRIED

75
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:40,665
ABOUT SOURCES AND METHODS AND

76
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:41,466
NATIONAL SECURITY.

77
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:44,135
IS THIS CONNECTED TO ROD

78
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:44,536
ROSENSTEIN?

79
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:46,471
HE'S FIRED OR HE'S NOT FIRED.

80
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:49,107
THERE IS A MEETING, THERE IS NOT

81
00:02:49,107 --> 00:02:50,742
A MEETING.

82
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:53,278
IS THIS ROSENSTEIN APPLYING

83
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:53,812
LEVERAGE?

84
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:55,980
IT SEEMS HE'S THE ONE WHO IS

85
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,182
GOING TO FALL.

86
00:02:57,182 --> 00:03:01,986
>> I DON'T KNOW YES WAS INVOLVED

87
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:03,421
IN THIS PROCESS.

88
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:05,824
HE SHOULD NOT BE ADVISING THE

89
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:07,859
PRESIDENT ON THIS.

90
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:09,761
EVERYBODY IN CONGRESS, THE

91
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,130
SPEAKER, THE LEADER, THE WHIP,

92
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,899
THE WHOLE INTELLIGENCE

93
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:18,403
COMMITTEE, NEARLY EVERY

94
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:20,605
REPUBLICAN CALLED FOR THESE

95
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:23,108
DOCUMENTS TO BE DECLASSIFIED.

96
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:26,444
JEAN WHERE THE PRESIDENT --

97
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:27,979
JUDGE JEANINE: THE PRESIDENT

98
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,781
CHANGED HIS MIND.

99
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:32,284
>> IF ROSENSTEIN WAS INVOLVED IN

100
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:34,252
THAT PROCESS, IT SHOULD BE A

101
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:36,121
DISMISS AFTER THAT MEETING.

102
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:38,957
WHENEVER WE MOVE TO GET THINGS

103
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,559
DECLASSIFIED THEY SAY WE ARE

104
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,460
GOING TO RUIN NATIONAL SECURITY.

105
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,996
WHAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME?

106
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:48,633
THE STUFF COMES OUT AND IT MAKES

107
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:49,968
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE

108
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:57,976
FBI AND GPS AND THEY ALL LOOK

109
00:03:57,976 --> 00:03:58,310
BAD.

110
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,481
JUDGE JEANINE: THERE IS NOTHING

111
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:04,917
THAT -- I COULD HAVE IMPANELED A

112
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,119
GRAND JURY WITHOUT INSPECTOR

113
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:09,788
GENERAL GIVING ME A 500-PAGE

114
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:10,122
REPORT.

115
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:12,324
WHAT IS THE I.G. DOING?

116
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:14,626
>> THE I.G. IS FINE.

117
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:15,394
GREAT.

118
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:17,529
THE I.G. IS GOING TO LOOK AT IT.

119
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,165
WE ARE A SEPARATE BRANCH OF

120
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:21,266
GOVERNMENT.

121
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:22,601
WE CREATED THE DEPARTMENT OF

122
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,602
JUSTICE.

123
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:25,471
WE HAVER RIGHT TO SEE THAT

124
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,904
INFORMATION.

125
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:28,574
WE HAVE DECIDED THE AMERICAN

126
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:29,575
PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THE

127
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:30,209
INFORMATION.

128
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:31,477
THE PRESIDENT WANTS THE AMERICAN

129
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:33,012
PEOPLE TO SEE THE INFORMATION.

130
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:34,913
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THIS CAN BE

131
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:35,581
HELD UP?

132
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:37,683
I THINK ALL THEY ARE TRYING TO

133
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:39,651
DO IS STALL UNTIL AFTER THE

134
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:40,119
MID-TERMS.

135
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,887
BUT WE ARE RIGHT AT THE END.

136
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:44,990
WE HAVE 20 PAGES OF THE CONTENT,

137
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,425
WHICH IS THE INSURANCE POLICY.

138
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:51,430
WE HAVE THE BRUCE OHR 302s.

139
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,400
THIS IS BRUCE OHR'S WIFE WAS

140
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,402
WORKING FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN

141
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:58,704
AS THIS WAS BEING FURNLED INTO

142
00:04:58,704 --> 00:05:01,340
THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE THE TRUMP

143
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,107
CAMPAIGN.

144
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:04,643
SO WHY WOULD WE STILL BE HERE

145
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:06,445
NEARLY A MONTH AWAY FROM THE

146
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:09,114
ELECTIONS AND WE STILL CAN'T GET

147
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:11,317
TRANSPARENCY OUT TO THE AMERICAN

148
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:11,116
OH

149
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:13,185
PEOPLE?

150
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:16,221
-- SO THE PRESIDENT HAS TO DO

151
00:05:16,221 --> 00:00:00,000
SOMETHING.
