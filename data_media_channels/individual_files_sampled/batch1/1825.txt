even though it's national de Cameroon is very much a divided country you could argue it's even more divided this year we're seeing pictures of empty streets online like this one where the English speakers are refusing to celebrate the government has imposed a curfew there on the french side however hundreds of troops are preparing for parades in the capital the divide between the English and the French speakers dates back decades to the 60s while some Anglophones are asking for equal representation and government and society others are calling for their own country a place they call ambos onea both sides are incredibly vocal online and communicate with strong and unified hashtags like free southern Cameroon's and hashtag Anglophone one of their demands though is that the international community recognized that the government is committing violence against them that demand was answered this week when the US ambassador to Cameroon said the government is indeed committing targeted killings the Ambassador also said working with the two sides is like watching a dialogue of the death no I will say that you know there there's violence on both sides the government has committed summary executions they are guilty of detaining people and not allowing them access to lawyers to their families even to visits from the Red Cross they have been guilty of burning villages and looting and general harassment of the population on the side of the receptionist the separatists we've seen you know horrible beheadings kidnappings of government officials and burning up schools so we want to stress that the United States condemns violence on both sides we asked you online in Cameroon for reaction to what the US had to say we had a great response though many of the messages sounded the same for example one woman wrote we will all love to share a video with you the problem is our expected lifespan is going to fall considerably once that airs you really have to be here to understand the impunity and the extreme prejudice with which the military brutalizes and intimidates the local population now since 2016 the UN says 160,000 english-speaking Cameroonians have fled the violence even still some of you sent us videos asking that we share your story in times of war and times of such conflicts everybody loses Cameroon as a nation loses I don't see why so difficult so difficult for the government we're supposed to protect people to really organize and have some sort of die sit down the table mister I want to call me mr. beer yes is mr. beer sit down the table with people and have a chart we are suffering people are unable to get their drugs you pull out on able to get food was stifled if you're in Cameron do continue to send us videos and comments you're one of our strongest communities online and we love hearing from you here at age a news grid you can write us on encrypted messenger or on whatsapp or telegram our number is right there for you also we have this hashtag for you and you can always write me personally at Leah Hardy an aje
