can you sum up your thesis of how Democrats expect and often get women voters well right one one thing that the left has been very good at doing is reducing people to so-called identities rather than to a system of ideas so they don't have to defend their ideas they don't have to defend their results they just tell you you are a black you are a woman you are a gay person and we are going to help that class of people in some mysterious way that doesn't help the rest of the country so they've been very good at doing this with women especially women who have a sense of grievance that may not be connected to anything real I mean one of the things that is so fascinating about the women's March is I don't know what they're marching for they are marching for some sense of grievance that really has nothing to do with their actual situation so if you get enough women to come together and say well my boss at work said something mean to me or grabbed my butt or whatever you know you get this sense of grievance going on but really American women are the most privileged most free most prosperous women that have ever lived on the face of this planet ever so and and under the administration of Donald Trump they're actually doing quite well so what the left is really done is they've set up on the one side this kind of fantastical view of women as an aggrieved class and on the other side they have with the help of Donald Trump the fact that Donald Trump is a kind of guy that a lot of women dislike he's arrogant he's murky he says insulting things he talks in a way that puts women off and you know try just try saying to a woman you know you may not like Donald Trump he makes smirk a lot he may say things about grabbing women but he's actually doing quite a good job in helping you and your family and you cannot get past that female a feeling state that something is terribly wrong and it really and and the Democrats depend on this you know the fact that some women like to be lied to is is such a cliche that it's been a part of comedy you know the woman comes in and says does this dress make me look fat and if the husband tells her the truth she gets angry at him you know and and when you hear this kind of things that Democrats say to women it's the same kind of flattering lies SiC things like if a woman makes an accusation of rape she should be believed and you think why you know or women some kind of sparkly magical creature that who doesn't lie like everybody else I mean everybody lies we lie about big things we lie about small things dishonest people obviously lie a lot about a lot of things and they're both men and women so it's just a complete lie that they tell women about themselves and and then you know the this idea that that something is is really wrong I mean did you see that Oprah Winfrey speech at the Golden Globes where she talked about some black woman who had been raped in 1944 and compared that to the state of women today well on what planet oh how are those two things related they're not related at all and then she wound up into this triumphant you know a new day is coming and we're gonna save you and I just thought really you know you're talking to a roomful of movie stars with who are doing great they're making millions and millions of dollars you're talking to women in America who are likewise doing better than they were certainly than they were doing during the Obama administration what's the grievance it's just a feeling of grievance that the Left plays into and they play women for fools and they do it very successfully that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
