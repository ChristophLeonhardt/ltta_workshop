wow what a week it's been for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario I'm going to Murphy recap the unintentionally humorous week that was and explain why the voting process in terms of choosing the next leader might be a not so elaborate trap for frontrunner Doug Ford the saga of the PC Party of Ontario which should not be confused with Alan Moore's superb saga of The Swamp Thing began with one hell of an impromptu press conference in which ex PC leader Charlie Brown I mean Patrick Brown denied allegations of sexual impropriety a couple hours ago I learned about troubling allegations about my conduct and character and I'm here tonight to address them first I want to say these allegations are false categorically untrue every one of them I will defend myself as hard as I can with all means at my disposal Brown bowed to come into work the next day business as usual but within hours of giving that presser and with his own team deserting him on mass Patrick had this to say not exactly as Illustrated of course as the tagline goes meanwhile for the incredibly unpopular Premier Kathleen Wynne in her caucus they just couldn't believe the good fortune in seeing the PC party thrown into chaos less than five months before the election ditto for NDP Leader Andrea Horwath and then the race was on for a new leader the list of potential candidates came in fast and curious Vic Vidal II Lisa McLeod rod Phillips Carolyn Maroney Christine Elliot Erin O'Toole and then just two days before the convention rules were set Doug let's make Ontario great again Ford announced he'd be running too and that's where our little saga stands today except for one thing in addition to requiring an entry fee of a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars to run in this leadership contest because hey obviously the PC party doesn't want any old riffraff becoming the Grand Poobah it was recently announced that the votes for party leader will be tallied electronically does anyone have a problem this well you should have a problem with this for three reasons first we know that several PC riding nomination meetings were rife with allegations of fraud and ballot box stuffing and this is not hearsay there's even a criminal investigation going on in Hamilton West Ancaster Dundas writing as well consider this we were there to cover the PC nomination meeting for the Richmond Hill riding that took place last year a Mother's Day the party was dead set against frontrunner and social conservative Daisy way being it's Richmond Hill representative so just a few weeks before nomination meeting a newcomer Larry Coombs suddenly entered the race and in dramatic fashion to boot in a very short time indeed Coombs was somehow able to sign up a staggering twelve hundred plus members now I tried to find out how Coombs was able to sign up such an incredible number of new members and what followed was the briefest of interviews there how do you respond to a lot of PC people have told us that there are so many oh you do okay thank you so much now get this when the polls closed and the ballots were counted an absolutely remarkable thing happened in Richmond Hill voting ended in a two-way tie between Larry Coombs and Daisy Way and under the rules governing candidate nominations the tie-breaking vote went to writing Association president al it waar an award chose Daisy way the Coombs camp and the PC brass was livid but riddle me this why wouldn't the losing candidate Larry Coombs ask for a recount of the ballots I mean it was a tie after all it's quite possible somebody miscounted a single ballot but no recount was called for so I'll leave it to your imagination why secondly in Tourmaline er vic vidal e dropped a bombshell earlier this week when he alleged that his number-one job as interim leader is to fix the rot within the pc party that's right the PC party is rotten according to fidelity which is either disturbed or Fedele is admitting to the worst-kept open secret in ontario politics and thirdly it was also revealed earlier this week that the pc database was hacked by an outsider last november gulp so in summary allegations of ballot box fraud galore the party brass is allegedly rotten and the PCs PCs are vulnerable to infiltration from outsiders would you trust these political Keystone Cops to honestly and accurately tally the electronically cast ballots of a leadership contest especially when it is known that the elites within this party are terrified of Doug Ford becoming leader I have zero point zero confidence in the PC party brass and if I were Ford I would demand an old-fashioned old-school paper ballot process with independent scrutineers counting each and every ballot twice over because otherwise I'm smelling a potential screw job here that would make Pepe LePew scent resemble Chanel number 5 by comparison for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a
