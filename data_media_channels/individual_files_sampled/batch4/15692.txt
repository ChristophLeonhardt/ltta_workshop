President Trump is firing back at James Comey and the deep state I'm gonna tell you all about it President Trump is finally punching back at those who are coming after him and I like what he's doing he announced that he's going to pardon scooter libby now for those who don't remember scooter libby was vice president Dick Cheney's chief of staff during the Bush administration he was convicted of the same nonsense general Flynn was the bogus processed crime of lying to federal investigators and there was a lot of doubt that Libby ever lied most people felt that lady just simply didn't remember the conversation wasn't super forthcoming as a result and of course prosecutors who tend to be institutionally Democrat in the Department of Justice went after him with a vengeance the context of the case was the outing the disclosure of the name of Valerie Plame who was a mid-level CIA analyst she wasn't a deep cover agent in country Libby didn't leak her name that's a popular misconception by liberals out there on social media Libby never leaked her name it was richard armitage a former State Department official who admitted in the media back then that he leaked Valerie Plame's named Libby like general Flynn was just being strong-armed to cooperate against other Bush administration officials aim nonsense and he was convicted of the bogus process crime of Miss statements to federal investigators george w bush commuted Libby's sentence he didn't to serve jail time but he didn't pardon him Trump is coming in with the full pardon and here's why I love it because it's a big slap in the face to Muller who was FBI director at the time call me who was a senior Department of Justice official at the time and the Bush's the Bush family who supported Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the election because Trump insulted big crybaby loser low-energy jab this is a great opening shot now Trump needs to go on the offensive and use the power of the presidency to take on all of his enemies and shut this nonsense down Muller can't be allowed to operate for another day Rosenstein should've been fired four days ago of course frozen team being the Deputy Attorney General over at our Department of Justice now President Trump is also firing back hard at James Comey I mean James call me is just an insufferable wine cry-baby a six-foot-seven mopey loser who's crying the george stephanopolous lying about general kelly a caring that he was fired general kelly said the conversation lasted one minute told him i didn't know why he was fired and i wished him good luck with his life i'm paraphrasing but that was the gist of what general kelly statement was on commis assertion that general kelly was essentially inconsolable that Comey was fired Piers general kelly couldn't have cared less nobody really respected Comey call me as a proven liar mccabe is a proven liar that whole cabal inside the FBI are proven liars the President Trump wrote and every word is true he tweeted two-part tweet it's exceptional James Comey is a proven leaker and liar virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did until he was in fact fired he leaked classified information for which he should be prosecuted he lied to Congress under oath he is a weak and untruthful slimeball who was as time has proven a terrible director of the FBI no I love it a weak and untruthful slimeball his handling of the crooked Hillary Clinton case and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst botched jobs of history it was my great honor to fire James Comey now great opening shot by President Trump great move pardoning Libby what President Trump should also do what he should also do is say that unless the charges against general Flynn are dropped and vacated he's going to appoint the second special counsel actually no he should go a step further what he should say is if come and mccabe are not criminally charged by close of business today he's issuing a blanket pardon a general flynn and recommending general Flynn's plea and charges be vacated if homey and mccabe are not charged he should pardon general Flynn and if they are well he shouldn't pardon them he shouldn't do a thing but push for their prosecution he shouldn't help them in any way shape or form in fact he should use the power of the presidency and his role as the chief law enforcement officer his role as chief law enforcement officer to make sure they serve hard jail time and if he wants the two of them charged or he says pardon general flynn and the two of them were charged he should pardon general Flynn anyway was what's the DOJ gonna do with what are they gonna do reverse the charges then they lose all credibility see it's time for the president to start boxing them in like they're boxing him in they're boxing him in with Muller they're boxing him in with Syria he needs to stop listening to his his counsel Ty Cobb and acro now he tweeted that he has confidence in those lawyers he said yesterday I have agreed with the historically cooperative disciplined approach that we have engaged him with Robert Muller unlike the Clintons I have full confidence in Ty Cobb my special counsel and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process I wish ty cobb is a little tougher but clearly the president knows things we don't I do want to see the president start firing people though starting with rod Rosenstein that throws everybody off balance and it shows the establishment all of those working against him that he's very serious about fighting back now this bipartisan bill going through Congress I spoke about it a bit yesterday there's bipartisan bill that says we should protect the special counsel is ridiculous I feel that it's bipartisan because never Trump Republicans who were behind the dossier like McCain like many others those never Trump Republicans don't want their names revealed as this o IG report comes out and people start spilling people start talking there are gonna be a lot of Republicans who worked alongside Democrats who remove Donald Trump from the presidency that he won with 63 million very enthusiastic votes oh I just hope the president starts to get tougher I hope this is all an opening salvo these are opening shots in his offensive against Rod Rosenstein robert muller james comey and that clinton obama cabal I love what the president's doing and I want to keep bringing you these updates every day help me do that by subscribing to our premium service at WWWE a forward slash shows
