1
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:14,531
>> WILL THE TRADE WAR HAVE AN

2
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:17,267
IMPACT EFFECT ON THE SECURITY

3
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:17,701
RELATIONSHIP?

4
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,203
RIGHT NOW I DON'T SEE THAT.

5
00:00:19,203 --> 00:00:21,205
WE'RE LOOKING FOR RECIPROCAL

6
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:22,172
TRADE.

7
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:24,174
ALONG THE PATH GOING THERE,

8
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:25,576
CERTAINLY IT WILL BE A LITTLE

9
00:00:25,576 --> 00:00:28,145
ROCKY A LITTLE BUMPY AT TIMES.

10
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:30,814
BUT SO FAR I DON'T ANTICIPATE

11
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:33,116
ANY EFFECT IN THE SECURITY

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,417
ARENA.

13
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:34,051
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

14
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:38,288
THAT'S THE READ FROM THE DEFENSE

15
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:38,956
SECRETARY.

16
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,191
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT KAY BAILEY

17
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,993
HUTCHISON AGREES.

18
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:43,794
AMBASSADOR, THANKS FOR SPENDING

19
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:44,228
THE TIME.

20
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:47,798
IS IT YOUR SENSE TOO THIS WILL

21
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,134
NOT BOOMERANG ON US, THE TRADE

22
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,569
TENSIONS BETWEEN THE ALLIES

23
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:54,171
HURTING OUR SECURITY RELATIONS?

24
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:56,506
>> YOU KNOW, NEIL, IN A GROUP OF

25
00:00:56,506 --> 00:01:00,043
29 COUNTRIES, THERE ARE A LOT OF

26
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:02,379
DISAGREEMENTS ON A BILATERAL

27
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:02,913
BASIS.

28
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:05,015
THERE'S DISAGREEMENTS WITHIN

29
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:07,818
NATO ON HOW WE DO THINGS.

30
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,287
THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT ON OUR

31
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:12,689
GOAL, OUR COMMON GOAL OF A

32
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,525
SECURITY UMBRELLA FOR ALL 29 OF

33
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:15,893
US.

34
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:18,996
AND I THINK THE PROFESSIONAL

35
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,865
DIPLOMATS HERE ARE VERY GOOD.

36
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:25,235
THEY DO NOT BRING UP BILATERAL

37
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:26,436
DISPUTES OR DISAGREEMENTS THAT

38
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:27,104
THEY MAY HAVE.

39
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:28,538
WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH

40
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:31,541
ALL THE OTHER AMBASSADORS THAT

41
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,277
WE'RE ABLE TO TALK THROUGH

42
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:33,610
THINGS.

43
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,380
I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT NATO

44
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,048
STAYING VERY UNITED AND

45
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,482
TOGETHER.

46
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:40,317
UNITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

47
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,119
THING THAT WE HAVE.

48
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,157
AND WE DO HAVE IT.

49
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:49,793
>> Neil: SO THERE'S NO CONCERNS,

50
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,094
EVER FOOTING THE BILL OR PUTTING

51
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:54,698
THE 2% OR NATO AND DEFENSES,

52
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,434
THAT WERE IN DOUBT A LITTLE MORE

53
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:00,103
THAN 1 1/2 YEARS AGO?

54
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:03,106
>> I THINK THAT WHAT PRESIDENT

55
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:05,776
TRUMP HAS DONE IS REALLY MADE A

56
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:08,011
BIG POINT AND HE'S MADE IT

57
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:09,112
PUBLICLY.

58
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:11,615
COUNTRIES ARE COMING THROUGH.

59
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:14,918
EVERY NATO ALLY REALLY IN 2016

60
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:16,853
DID NOT INCREASE SPENDING, BUT

61
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:19,990
AS OF TODAY, EVERY NATO ALLY IS

62
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,159
INCREASING THEIR OWN DEFENSE

63
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:22,526
SPENDING.

64
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:24,861
IN 2018 WHEN THE NUMBERS ARE

65
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:27,130
FINISHED, WE'LL HAVE THE LARGEST

66
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,699
INCREASE IN DEFENSE SPENDING BY

67
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:32,636
OUR NATO COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF

68
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:34,571
THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE COLD

69
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:34,905
WAR.

70
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,908
SO I THINK THAT WE ARE GOING IN

71
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,910
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

72
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,677
EVERYONE IS TRYING HARD.

73
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:42,045
THERE'S DIFFERENCES.

74
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,847
LOOK AT ITALY.

75
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:45,983
THEY'VE HAD TROUBLE FORMING A

76
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:47,084
GOVERNMENT.

77
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,218
GERMANY TOOK SEVERAL MONTHS TO

78
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:50,554
FORM A GOVERNMENT AFTER

79
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:50,921
ELECTIONS.

80
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,422
WE HAVE DELAYS AND THEN YOU

81
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,690
DON'T GET BUDGETS.

82
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:59,196
SO I THINK WE'RE GOING IN THE

83
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:00,163
RIGHT DIRECTION.

84
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:01,531
WE DO.

85
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:04,601
WE WANT THE 2% TO REPRESENT NOT

86
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,670
JUST A NUMBER OUT THERE, BUT THE

87
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,940
AMOUNT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A

88
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,442
SIGNIFICANT DETERRENCE AGAINST A

89
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,910
REAL ENEMY.

90
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,280
THAT IS WHAT IT CAME UP IN THE

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,783
WALES SUMMIT, THE NUMBER WAS 2%.

92
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,952
2% IS NOT TOO MUCH TO PAY FOR

93
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,488
THE SECURITY AND FREEDOM OF YOUR

94
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:25,422
PEOPLE.

95
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:27,057
THAT'S WHAT NATO BELIEVES AND

96
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:28,859
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

97
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:29,226
ACHIEVE.

98
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:32,529
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN GOOD

99
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,931
ORDER.

100
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:41,872
>> Neil: I'M BACK TO THIS TRADE

101
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:43,006
TIFF.

102
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:44,041
AMERICANS DON'T SEE ANYTHING

103
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,209
YESTERDAY OR NOR DO FARMERS.

104
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,878
IF IT DOES, THE PRESIDENT HAS

105
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:49,679
ARGUED THAT THESE ARE AS MUCH

106
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,581
ABOUT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY

107
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:54,851
EFFORTS AS THEY ARE ECONOMIC

108
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:55,185
DESIRES.

109
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:58,088
THAT THEY INTERTWINE.

110
00:03:58,088 --> 00:04:00,490
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

111
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,859
>> I DO THINK THAT THE TARIFFS

112
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:05,028
ARE CERTAINLY AN ISSUE.

113
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:08,098
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT'S NOT

114
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:09,166
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE

115
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:09,666
CONCERNED ABOUT.

116
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,569
WHAT WE WANT IS TO SOLVE THE

117
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:12,903
PROBLEM.

118
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:15,605
WE WANT FAIR AND LEVEL PLAYING

119
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:15,939
FIELDS.

120
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:19,910
WE'RE TALKING NOW ABOUT E.U.

121
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,543
COOPERATION.

122
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:22,245
FORMING A NEW DEFENSE

123
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:22,646
INITIATIVE.

124
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:25,482
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

125
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:27,584
THERE'S ACCESS TO OUTSIDE E.U.

126
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:30,520
COUNTRIES TO BE ABLE TO BID ON

127
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,223
DEFENSE PROJECTS AND NATO JUST

128
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:36,326
LIKE WE ALLOW FROM THE UNITED

129
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:36,660
STATES.

130
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,763
LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT LAST

131
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:42,499
YEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

132
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,301
SPENT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS

133
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:47,971
WITH FOREIGN ALLIES BUYING THEIR

134
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:50,273
PRODUCTS FOR OUR DEFENSE

135
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:50,640
PURPOSES.

136
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,143
SO WE WANT THAT SAME LEVEL

137
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,845
PLAYING FIELD WITH THE E.U.

138
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:56,179
COUNTRIES WHEN THEY'RE GOING OUT

139
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,848
FOR A PROCUREMENT.

140
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:00,617
WE WANT TO DO THINGS TOGETHER.

141
00:05:00,617 --> 00:05:01,885
WE CAN COMPETE.

142
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,920
WE ALSO WANT THE BEST PRODUCTS

143
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,455
FOR OUR OVERALL SECURITY.

144
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:08,258
THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

145
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:08,525
GET.

146
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:10,327
>> Neil: ARE YOU CONCERNED,

147
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:12,395
AMBASSADOR, I KNOW YOU HAVE TO

148
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,833
PLAY THIS DIPLOMATICALLY AS THE

149
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,368
LIAISON WITH NATO, BUT THIS IS

150
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,003
COMING AT A TIME IN THIS DUST-UP

151
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:22,739
WITH SOME OF OUR ALLIES AND OUR

152
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,107
FRIENDS WHEN WE HAVE TO DEAL

153
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:26,143
WITH THE CHINESE, HAVE TO DEAL

154
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,111
WITH THE NORTH KOREANS AND THAT

155
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,614
WE COULD BE ALIENATING THEM AT A

156
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:32,315
TIME WHEN WE NEED THEM.

157
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:33,783
DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT?

158
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:39,723
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK EVERY

159
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:40,924
RELATIONSHIP HAS SO MANY FACETS

160
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,794
AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE

161
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:45,328
HAVE.

162
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:47,864
FOR INSTANCE, WE TALKED ABOUT

163
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:50,167
GERMANY NOT MEETING THE 2%.

164
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:53,770
BUT WE HAVE 300,000 TROOPS IN

165
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,104
GERMANY.

166
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,972
MAY NOT BE 300,000.

167
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:58,975
I THINK I I MISSPOKE.

168
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,010
IT'S 35,000.

169
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,845
BUT IT'S -- THAT'S SOMETHING

170
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,747
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN OUR

171
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:04,814
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.

172
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:06,783
WE WANT GERMANY TO DO MORE, BUT

173
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,385
WE RESPECT THAT THEY'RE DOING A

174
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:09,719
LOT IN AFGHANISTAN.

175
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,621
THEY'RE ONE OF THE FRAME WORK

176
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,789
NATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN.

177
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,825
SO WE WANT THEM TO MEET THE 2%,

178
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:17,561
BUT THERE'S OTHER FACTORS.

179
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:21,331
ALL OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE

180
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:21,932
INTERTWINED.

181
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:24,668
SO YES, THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME

182
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:26,836
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE TARIFFS.

183
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:29,539
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

184
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:32,542
BUT WHAT I THINK IS THE PURPOSE

185
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:35,879
HERE IS TO TRY TO GET A MORE

186
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,216
EVEN TRADE RELATIONSHIP AND HAVE

187
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:42,485
A TRUE ALLIANCE AT NATO THAT

188
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,688
DOES HAVE SOME OF OUR ALLIES

189
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:47,424
THAT HAVEN'T PUT UP AS MUCH AS

190
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:48,892
THEY COULD WHILE THEY ARE GIVING

191
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:51,127
IN OTHER AREAS TO BE HELPFUL.

192
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:53,830
SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE ALL OF

193
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,130
THIS.

194
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,566
WE CANNOT STEP BACK ON THE 2%.

195
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:59,836
THAT IS WHAT WE NEED FOR THE

196
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,272
OVERALL BIG PICTURE SECURITY.

197
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:05,375
BUT WE KNOW THAT MANY ALLIES ARE

198
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,810
ALSO PUTTING TROOPS ON THE

199
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,380
GROUND, ADVISING IN AFGHANISTAN.

200
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,350
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE IRAQIS AS

201
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,752
WELL FOR ADVISING THEM ON HOW TO

202
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:18,388
GET ISIS OUT OF THEIR COUNTRY

203
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,991
AND STABILIZE THEIR COUNTRY.

204
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,059
SO WE'RE DOING MANY THINGS IN

205
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:24,761
DIFFERENT AREAS AND WE HAVE TO

206
00:07:24,761 --> 00:00:00,000
FACTOR ALL OF THAT IN.
