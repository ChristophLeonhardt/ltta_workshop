1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,270
>>RENT IN MIAMI HAS BECOME SO
EXPENSIVE THAT TEACHERS WHO WORK

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,450
IN THE MIAMI-DADE DISTRICT ARE

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,839
HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME
PAYING RENT.

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,620
THEY HAVE RESPONDED BY PROPOSING
NEW BUILDINGS CLOSE TO THE

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,750
SCHOOLS THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,480
OFFER CHEAPER RENT FOR THESE
EDUCATORS AND POSSIBLY OTHER

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:51,309
EMPLOYEES 
IN 

8
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:52,769
THE SCHOOLS.

9
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:57,960
WHEN I FIRST READ THE HEADLINES
OF THE STORY I THOUGHT MAYBE

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,219
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

11
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,940
JUST PAY TEACHERS MORE SO THEY
CAN AFFORD THE RENT.

12
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,690
THE RENT IN THESE AREAS ARE
EXPENSIVE FOR EVERYONE.

13
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,950
BASED ON WHAT I HAVE SEEN SO FAR
IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD

14
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,950
IDEA.

15
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,180
THE TEACHERS ARE PRETTY
SUPPORTIVE OF IT.

16
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:32,490
LET ME TELL YOU MORE.

17
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,130
SO THEY WOULD PRICE THE UNITS
BASED ON A SLIDING SCALE AND OF

18
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,270
COURSE IT WOULD RELY ON WHAT THE
TEACHER OR THE EMPLOYEE IS

19
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,799
MAKING FOR THEIR SALARY.

20
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,119
>>I
HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THIS.

21
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,579
ON THE ONE HAND IT IS WONDERFUL
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET A

22
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:55,780
COMBINATION AND LOWER RENTS AND
THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING

23
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,590
OUT FOR THE TEACHERS.

24
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,740
ON THE OTHER HAND IT
FEELS LIKE THE BARRACKS.

25
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,969
AND IF THEY ARE IN THE SAME
BUILDING THEN THEY ARE GOING TO

26
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:09,590
PICK THE TEACHERS LIVES.

27
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,660
WHAT THE TEACHER BRINGS HOME A
BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND AND THEY

28
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,011
DO WHAT BOYFRIENDS AND
GIRLFRIENDS DO?

29
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:25,940
WHAT DO 

30
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,560
WE JUST

31
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,160
PAY OUR TEACHERS MORE?

32
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,020
>> I AGREE WITH YOU.

33
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,330
EVEN SO EVEN IF THE TEACHERS ARE
GETTING PAID MORE, RENTS IN

34
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:51,960
THESE AREAS ARE SO EXPENSIVE.

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,430
THERE IS ANOTHER UPSIDE TO THIS
THAT I THINK MAYBE YOU ARE NOT

36
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,880
CONSIDERING.

37
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,410
THEY ARE GOING TO BE CLOSE TO
WORK AND FOR SOME OF US THAT

38
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,150
MIGHT SOUND LIKE I AM LIVING AT
WORK, BUT A LOT OF THEM LOVE THE

39
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,470
IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO JUST WALK
AROUND THE CORNER FROM THEIR

40
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,450
APARTMENT BUILDING AND WALKED
INTO WORK AND NOT HAVE TO DEAL

41
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,010
WITH THE COMMUTE.

42
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,690
MIAMI IS NOTORIOUSLY BAD WHEN
IT COMES TO TRAFFIC.

43
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,510
I WOULD ARGUE PERSONNEL ABLE
PEOPLE WOULD DISAGREE WITH ME.

44
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:28,780
>>ANOTHER
UPSIDE IS THAT YOU SAVE GAS.

45
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,070
ANOTHER UPSIDE IS THAT THEY
WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD

46
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,220
LIVING THERE ON A TEACHER
SALARY.

47
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,650
OTHER DOWNSIDES, YOU ARE
PROBABLY IN THE SAME APARTMENT

48
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,920
COMPLEX IS THE PRINCIPAL.

49
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,120
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE EVER
KNOWN TEACHERS WHO WORKED IN THE

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,430
SCHOOLS THERE IS A TON OF
POLITICS.

51
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,900
AND YOU ARE IN THE SAME BUILDING
AND CAN'T ESCAPE THEM.

52
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,990
>> YOU MENTION A PRETTY
SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDE.

53
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:05,420
BEING IN A HOLDING FULL OF
PEOPLE YOU CAN STAND IS NOT FUN.

54
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,510
>>I'M SURE A LOT OF THEM ARE
GREAT FRIENDS AND LOVE EACH

55
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,190
OTHER BUT THERE IS ALSO PEOPLE

56
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,400
THAT YOU PROBABLY DON'T GET
ALONG WITH AND YOU ARE FORCED TO

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,610
BE IN THE SAME BUILDING.

58
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,988
>>LET
ME BE CLEAR, NO ONE IS FORCED.

59
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,271
THE TEACHERS WOULD OPT IN SO
THEY WOULD APPLY FOR THE

60
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:26,940
APARTMENTS MUCH LIKE ANY OTHER
APARTMENT YOU WOULD WANT TO

61
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,840
LIVE IN.

62
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,050
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU WORK FOR THE
SCHOOL, YOU HAVE TO LIVE HERE.

63
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,010
I THINK THIS IS GENUINELY
COMING FROM A GOOD PLACE.

64
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,410
I THINK THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
REALLY WANTS TO HELP THESE

65
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,690
TEACHERS WHO JUST CAN'T AFFORD

66
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,690
THE RENT.

67
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,730
LET ME GIVE YOU SPECIFIC DETAILS
ON HOW MUCH IT COSTS JUST TO

68
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,570
LIVE THERE.

69
00:04:50,570 --> 00:05:02,690
SO THEY ARE 
TAKING A LOOK AT

70
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,080
RENT PRICES COMPARED TO SALARY.

71
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:22,920
THERE IS JUST THIS GIANT GAP
WHEN IT 

72
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,200
COMES TO AFFORDABILITY.

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,930
>>WE HAVE REALLY LOST OUR MINDS.

74
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,850
WE HAVE TO GO TO THE FINLAND
MODEL AND I KNOW IT WILL BE

75
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,930
EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT AND RICH
PEOPLE WILL NOT WANT TO MOVE

76
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,980
THEIR KIDS OUT OF PRIVATE SCHOOL
BUT THE FINLAND MODEL IS

77
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,190
EVERYBODY GOES TO PUBLIC SCHOOL
AND TEACHERS ARE SUPER

78
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,850
RESPECTED AND REALLY WELL-PAID.

79
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,240
IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSIONS
IN THE COUNTRY.

80
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,710
UNSURPRISINGLY FINLAND RANKS AT
THE TOP OF ALL THE SCORES

81
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,120
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

82
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:05,170
AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE ASIAN
MODEL OF NONSTOP OVERWORK,

83
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,910
COMPETITION.

84
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,530
THEY ACTUALLY EMPHASIZE
COOPERATION AND THEY VALUE

85
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,530
COOPERATION.

86
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,800
WE NEED TO DO THE SAME.

87
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,660
PROGRESSIVES ARE GOING TO START
TO TAKE OVER CITIES IN A BIG

88
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,660
WAY.

89
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,720
FOR A LONG TIME THEY HAVE HAD TO
DEAL WITH MACHINE DEMOCRATIC

90
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,900
POLITICIANS THAT EVEN THOUGH
GIANT LIBERAL CITIES WOULD HAVE

91
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,530
DEMOCRATS AS MAYORS, IT WOULD
STILL BE THE SAME OLD GUYS IN

92
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,590
CHARGE.

93
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,540
SOON THERE WILL BE PROGRESSIVES
IN CHARGE THAT WON'T BE

94
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:44,840
CORRUPTED BY CAMPAIGN CASH.

95
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,890
THEY WILL SCREAM AT THE TOP
OF THEIR LUNGS.

96
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,931
BUT THEY WILL SAY WE ARE ENDING
THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS, BILL

97
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:57,950
GATES YOUR KIDS HAVE TO GO TO
THE SAME SCHOOLS AS MY KIDS.

98
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,250
THOSE TEACHER SALARIES WILL
IMPROVE SO STEADILY IT WILL

99
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,250
SHOCK PEOPLE.

100
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:10,720
>>YOU ALSO IMPROVE THE LIFE
OF YOUR CHILD.

101
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,770
THERE IS NOTHING MORE
DEVASTATING THAN BEING AN

102
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,390
EDUCATED PERSON HE WANTS TO DO
GOOD THINGS IN THE WORLD AND

103
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,950
YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO
DON'T HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES

104
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,660
AND DON'T HAVE AN EDUCATION.

105
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:29,150
IT IS GOING TO IMPROVE
EVERYONE'S LIVES AND YOU NEED TO

106
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,311
THINK ABOUT IT AS A COLLECTIVIST
THING INSTEAD OF AN

107
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:32,610
INDIVIDUALISTIC THING.

108
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,570
>>I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, RICH
PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO GET

109
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,770
LET THEIR KIDS GO TO
ABOUT SCHOOL.

110
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,310
WATCH, THEY WILL NOT LET THEIR

111
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,730
KIDS GO TO BAD SCHOOLS.

112
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,190
AND OUR
PUBLIC SCHOOLS WILL BE GREAT

113
00:07:48,190 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE OF THAT.
