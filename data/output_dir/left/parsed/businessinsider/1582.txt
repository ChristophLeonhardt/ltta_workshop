there are a lot of code words out there
on listings we as a non real estate
person I will to decode this for you
because realtor chat if you're reading a
listing for example and it says
something like great potential that just
means it's a piece of it needs a ton of
work time or I know my favorite is
artistic because if it says artistic
that means it is weird there's some
design that means something who knows no
idea about design they tried to design
it how about this
this house is cozy yeah that means it's
super tiny it's basically a New York
apartment I love natural landscaping
that means we're too lazy to do anything
so it's overgrown and you have to do all
the work if you pay extra for natural
landscaping you just got gypped
