we are back with my guest former attorney general eric holder also joining me Imus MBC Justice analyst Matt Miller who was chief spokesperson at the Department of Justice when Holder was the Attorney General we talk a lot in this news cycle about the Independence of the Justice Department and it's a it's a word that has a lot of force and meaning but I think for people that are outside it what is what does that actually mean like day to day live reality how you think about it in the culture of that place when you were there in the Obama administration given the power that the Attorney General has the ability to deprive people of their Liberty the ability to actually execute people that power has to be used in a way that is independent of any political influence and so when a day-to-day basis we were we made sure that we made our decisions on the basis of the of the law and the facts without any consideration of what the White House wanted us to do sometimes to the detriment of the relationship we had with with the White House now anything that was necessarily expressed directly to me but things that I heard know maybe sometime thereafter because I think in the Obama administration the president realized that an independent Justice Department was something that was important well what did it mean to you when you were there Matt well you know I came for the jet to the Justice Department from politics and learned pretty early that you had to take this job you have to look at this job differently than any job you'd ever had because there is this culture inside the department and you learn it on day one and everyone understands it that you don't talk to the White House about criminal cases you can talk to about something's you talk about policy matters you can talk about communications matters but you don't talk to about criminal cases and you never in a million years would talk to him about a criminal case that involved someone at the White House or someone close to the White House which is what has made watching this White House so hard is that the White House intervenes all the time about the things that affect the president things that affect the president's friends and and the other side to try to defect the president's political opponents they'll try to get them to prosecute Hillary I mean here's the president these are just just some tweets from the president everybody's asking why the Justice Department isn't looking into all the dishonesty going on with crooked Hillary and the Dems Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a very weak position of holding Clinton crimes where emails DNC server and Intel leakers why is age sessions asking the IG to investigate potentially massive fights of use will take forever has no prosecutor little power isn't the IGN Obama guy why not use Justice Department lawyers disgraceful I mean this amounts the president or during his AG publicly to prosecute as political enemies right and that's a very frightening thing and you know our institutions have held and I think our institutions will probably hold but these are tests of our institutions and we have seen these kinds of things in other countries in earlier times and I think we have to be cognizant of that this is there are things that are at risk here by that kind of conduct of the president but here's the thing yeah go ahead right so the institutions have held you haven't seen you know Hillary Clinton being indicted and they're trying to prosecute but you see the Justice Department's scurrying around all the time trying to do little things to make the president happy so yeah a US Attorney to do document review coming over and meeting with with the President to you know turn over documents about the Clinton investigation you see them you know freeing up a so-called whistleblower on the uranium one thing to go testify to Congress because the president was angry has white House Counsel call call over so you see all these little lines being crossed right they can give the president the big thing he wants they can't fire Mahler they can't prosecute Hillary so they do these little things to try to make him happy look at erosion on the margins has an impact you know and it's something that we should not discount there's not a huge line between having a system that works correctly and one that works incorrectly and the the more of this little stuff that you do use that line disappears that that to me is the most profound takeaway from this moment as I sit here every day and try to process us into the news is you know we think about the Constitution everyone talked about the Constitution like all this stuff we're talking about the part of justice White House that's none of it's in the Constitution to partner justice doesn't get created until the grant administration of a not mistaken and during Reconstruction there all this stuff about well the president shouldn't just direct people of prosecutors enemies that's not in the Constitution they you could do that right well I mean I guess the question is at the end of the day what is stopping it what holds it back but there are norms that will have always we've we've always had God does that sound insufficient to the task insufficient to the task and yet it is a part of I think the American DNA the American governmental DNA but we're being tested now and the question is whether or not we have sufficient amounts of that DNA in our system but there's gotta be what does that DNA look like like there's got to be something that that means people when you say DNA what that means is people make decisions like the people that's dmy make the decision that we are going to serve a search warrant on the president's lawyer because that is what our job in the law demands yeah it's in the DNA right now it's in the DNA kind of embedded in people at all levels of the department but if you had an attorney general for example who decided he wanted to take a different approach and said you know what the president wants this done I'm gonna do it you could see that changed you would see I think people resign you'd see people walk away but the eternal could probably do some of it I think the question that will happen your truck troubles gonna go away someday and I hope and one of the questions we'll have to look back and say you know kind of like after Watergate our norms enough or do we need to codify some of these these you know structures that prevent this kind of interference do you have faith in fundamentally in the judgment integrity of the Jeff Sessions to uphold the norms that we're discussing I worry a great deal and that's that's not a yes it's not yes this is a very difficult thing for me to say there's a very very difficult thing for me to say I'm not a person who likes to criticize my successors predecessors because I know how tough that job can be and yet the actions that he has taken in response to criticisms that he's received from the president his desire it appears to me to curry favor with the president who views him dis favorably worries me a great deal I'm not at all certain that he has got the steel that an Attorney General has to have I mean in my conference room as Matt will know you get to pick for attorneys general that you display I had Elliot Richardson left to to down to remind me that at some point an attorney generals got to say no to a president and maybe you're gonna lose your job as a result of that and I don't have faith in Jeff Sessions that he would look at the Elliot Richardson in the same way that I do I'm not sure I'll get the most honest answer from you for those questions but I asked you is he running for president is Eric Holder running for president I keep asking him because I want to know if I have to quit my job and move to Iowa so I don't know if I wish to be my press secretary I might consider it you are considering it yeah I'm thinking about it but I've not made any determinations I'm focusing on the work I'm doing with the National Democratic redistricting committee trying to deal with gerrymander which successfully got Scott Walker to call a special election he was trying to get out of yeah and we elected a Wisconsin Supreme Court justice they are campaigned there and got into a bit of a Twitter war with with with Governor Walker did stay out of Twitter was telling you first person let me tell you if there's one piece of life advice I can offer you Eric Holder it's there's one thing I know about really deeply is stay out of Twitter native New York born in the Bronx can take so much more in the Bronx here as well all right former attorney General Eric Holder you are invited to come by this table any time
