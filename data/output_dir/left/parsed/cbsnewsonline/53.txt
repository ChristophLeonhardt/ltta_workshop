>>> TAKING YOU TO THE WHITE
HOUSE NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP
HOLDING A JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF POLAND.
LET'S LISTEN IN.
>> THE PRESIDENT OF POLAND, A
FRIEND OF MINE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
GREAT HONOR.
IT'S LOVELY TO HAVE YOU AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
WE SPENT SOMETIME IN THE OVAL
OFFICE AND WE ACCOMPLISHED A
LOT.
MELANIA AND I ARE DEEPLY
GRATEFUL FOR THE INCREDIBLE
WELCOME THE PRESIDENT GAVE US IN
WARSAW, POLAND LAST YEAR.
IT WAS A VERY EXCEPTIONAL DAY.
EXTRAORDINARY.
IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE THEM BOTH
WITH US IN WASHINGTON TODAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
DURING MY VISIT LAST SUMMER I
HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO ADDRESS THE
PEOPLE OF POLAND ABOUT OUR
SHARED COMMITMENT TO DEFENDING
OUR HERITAGE AND OUR
CIVILIZATION.
IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE I WILL
ALWAYS TREASURE AND I WILL
NEVER, EVER FORGET.
NOT FAR FROM WHERE WE STAND
TODAY ANOTHER MONUMENT IN
ANOTHER SQUARE.
THE STATUE IN LAFAYETTE PARK
REMINDS US THAT THE BONDS
BETWEEN OUR PEOPLE GO ALL THE
WAY BACK TO AMERICA'S
REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
THIS YEAR THE UNITED STATES AND
POLAND ARE CELEBRATING 100 YEARS
OF POLAND REGAINING ITS
INDEPENDENCE AND NEARLY
100 YEARS OF U.S.-POLISH
DIPLOMATIC TIES.
THAT'S A LONG TIME.
I'M THRILLED TO SAY THAT THE
ALLIANCE BETWEEN OUR NATIONS HAS
NEVER BEEN STRONGER WITH YOU AND
I AT THE HELM.
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT.
GLAD HE SAID YES.
>> YES.
>> PRESIDENT DUDA AND I AGREED
TO POLLSTER OUR ROBUST DEFENSE
TIES.
WE WILL ENHANCE COOPERATION AND
MILITARY RELATIONS,
INTELLIGENCE, MISSILE DEFENSE,
TECHNOLOGY AND TRAINING.
I'M PROUD TO REPORT THAT POLAND
HAS RECENTLY PURCHASED A STATE
OF THE ART PATRIOT MISSILE
SYSTEM WHICH IS A GREAT SYSTEM,
WE MAKE THE GREATEST MILITARY
EQUIPMENT BY FAR ANYWHERE IN THE
WORLD.
AND IT'S MADE RIGHT HERE IN THE
USA.
WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR POLAND'S
LEADERSHIP ON DEFENSE SPENDING
AND BURDEN SHARING IN NATO.
I WANT TO COMMEND POLAND FOR
MEETING ITS NATO DEFENSE
SPENDING OBLIGATIONS AND I'M
GLAD THAT IT PLANS TO INCREASE
SPENDING BEYOND THE 2% MINIMUM
OBLIGATION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.
I'D LIKE TO SHARE MY GRATITUDE
TO THE PEOPLE OF POLAND FOR
THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO NATO'S
RESOLUTE SUPPORT MISSION IN
AFGHANISTAN AND THE COALITION TO
DEFEAT ISIS.
WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS
WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFEAT OF
ISIS AS YOU HAVE SEEN.
WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
CAN'T HAVE NATIONAL SECURITY
WITHOUT BORDER SECURITY BOTH
POLAND AND THE UNITED STATES
UNDERSTAND THAT STRONG NATIONS
MA MUST HAVE VERY STRONG
BORDERS.
THE PRESIDENT AND I LIKEWISE ARE
EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES TO
ADVANCE ENERGY SECURITY.
THE UNITED STATES AND POLAND ARE
DEEPLY COMMITTED TO ENERGY
DIVERSITY ALL ACROSS EUROPE.
NO NATION SHOULD BE DEPENDANT
UPON A SINGLE FOREIGN SUPPLIER
OF THIS MORNING.
POLAND HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO
INCREASE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
NATIONALLY AND ACROSS CENTRAL
EUROPE.
IT IS CONSTRUCTING A NEW
PIPELINE, THE HIGHEST
TECHNOLOGY, FROM NORWAY TO
POLAND.
AND IT RECENTLY BUILT A
LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS IMPORT
FACILITY.
LAST YEAR THE UNITED STATES WAS
PROUD TO SEND ITS FIRST EXPORT
OF LNG TO POLAND AND SOON OUR
NATIONS WILL LAUNCH A HIGH LEVEL
DIPLOMATIC EXCHANGE ON ENERGY
SECURITY.
AND MR. PRESIDENT, WE ARE NOW AS
OF A FEW MONTHS AGO THE LARGEST
PRODUCER OF ENERGY IN THE WORLD.
SO THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT.
PRESIDENT DUDA, I ALSO JUST WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE THREE
C'S SUMMIT WHERE CENTRAL
EUROPEAN LEADERS WERE WORKING
HARD TO INCREASE ENERGY MARKET
ACCESS, REDUCE ENERGY TRADE
BARRIERS WHICH IS SOMETHING WE
HAVE TO GET DONE WITH RESPECT TO
THE EUROPEAN UNION, THE TRADE
BARRIERS THEY MAKE IT VERY
DIFFICULT FOR THE UNITED STATES.
AND TO STRENGTHEN ENERGY
INDEPENDENCE.
THE UNITED STATES FIRMLY
SUPPORTS THESE GOALS AND WE ARE
EAGER TO EXPAND COMMERCIAL TIES
ALL ACROSS THE REGION OF EUROPE.
IN OUR MEETING TODAY THE
PRESIDENT AND I DISCUSSED OUR
BILATERAL ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP
AT LENGTH.
POLAND HAS EXPERIENCED MORE THAN
A QUARTER CENTURY OF
UNINTERRUPTED ECONOMIC GROWTH
WHICH IS A VERY BIG STATEMENT.
VERY FEW CAN SAY THAT.
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER
ENHANCING TRADE, INVESTMENT, AND
COMMERCE BETWEEN OUR TWO GREAT
NATIONS.
MY ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED
TO REALIZING A FUTURE OF
PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR
ALL AMERICANS.
THIS MONTH WE CELEBRATED THE
HIGHEST EMPLOYMENT LEVEL IN U.S.
HISTORY.
WE ARE RIGHT NOW EMPLOYING MORE
PEOPLE, WE HAVE MORE WORKERS IN
THE UNITED STATES THAN AT ANY
TIME EVER IN U.S. HISTORY.
I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING
WITH PRESIDENT DUDA AS WE GROW
OUR ECONOMY'S TOGETHER.
MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR
JOINING ME TODAY.
POLAND HAS CHOSEN ITS PLACE
AMONG THE FREE AND INDEPENDENT
NATIONS OF THE WORLD.
AND AS A LOYAL ALLY AND
STRATEGIC PARTNER OF THE UNITED
STATES AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE
THAT WE WELCOME THE NEXT
100 YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN
OUR TWO NATIONS.
MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT IN
THIS YEAR SO IMPORTANT TO POLAND
THE YEAR OF POLAND REGAINING ITS
INDEPENDENCE WE CELEBRATE OUR
ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY I AM
ABLE TO BE HOSTED HERE THAT I'M
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES AT THE WHITE HOUSE AT
WASHINGTON.
AND ALSO FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE
FOR THE RESPECTIVE OF THE
CENTENNIAL OF POLAND GAINING ITS
INDEPENDENCE THIS FACT IS FOR
POLES LIVING IN POLAND AND
ESPECIALLY THE 10 MILLION POLES
LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES THIS
IS A HUGE SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE.
ONE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE
METER OF POLISH INDEPENDENCE WAS
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT POINTS OF
THE POLICY OF U.S. PRESIDENT
WILSON.
IT WAS PRECISELY PRESIDENT
WILSON BEFORE 1918, HE WAS THE
ONE WHO PUT POLISH INDEPENDENCE
ON HIS AGENDA, ON THE AGENDA OF
HIS POLICY.
THAT HAPPENED AMONG OTHERS
THANKS TO A GREAT POLISH
POLITICIAN AND COMPOSER.
IT IS EFFECT THAT POLES
EXPERIENCED BACK THEN A LOT OF
GOOD FROM THE UNITED STATES AND
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER WORDS TO
DESCRIBE THE FACT THAT THAT
GREAT STATE INDICATED TO POLAND
AND FIND POLAND AS THE COUNTRY
WHO SHOULD BE REINSTATED ON THE
MAP OF EUROPE AND OTHER MAP OF
THE WORLD.
AND IT WASN'T REINSTATED THERE
IN 1918, 100 YEARS AGO.
AND I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE IN
WASHINGTON WITH THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES AND SIGN AN
AGREEMENT WHICH IS DEEPENING OUR
STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP AND WHICH
IS RENEWING THAT STRATEGIC
PARTNERSHIP.
I'M TALKING HERE ABOUT THE
AGREEMENT ON THE STRATEGY
PARTNERSHIP, SUCH AGREEMENT WAS
SIGNED IN 2008 INTO OUR
COUNTRIES.
BACK THEN IT WAS SIGNED BY THE
MINISTERS OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
AND TODAY THIS RENEWED VERSION,
THE VERSION WHICH HAS BEEN
UPDATED BECAUSE A LOT HAS
CHANGED OVER THE TEN YEARS.
THIS RENEWED VERSION OF THE
STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WAS SIGNED
PERSONALLY BY MYSELF AND
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY
DEEP GRATITUDE TO YOU, MR.
PRESIDENT FOR THAT FACT.
THIS AGREEMENT INDICATES THE
MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR
CORPORATION AND OUR FRIENDSHIP.
IT ALSO SETS NEW PATHS FOR THE
FUTURE.
THE PATHS OF TIGHTENING OUR
DEFENSE AND MILITARY
CORPORATION.
TIGHTENING OUR CORPORATION OF
THE SECURITY AND ENERGY
BUSINESS.
ALSO IN THE ASPECT OF THE
ALREADY MENTIONED CORPORATION AS
PART OF THE THREE C'S INITIATIVE
TO WHICH THE PRESIDENT JUST
ELUDED.
I CAME TO THE WASHINGTON AS PART
OF THE THREE C'S INITIATIVE.
THE UNITED STATES WAS PRESENT
THERE AND THANK YOU, MR.
PRESIDENT, FOR THAT.
THANK YOU FOR POSTING YOUR
REPRESENTATIVES TO THAT MEETING.
AND ALL OF THE LEADERS WHO HELD
THEIR SPEECHES THERE SAID IN A
VERY CLEAR WAY ABOUT THE NEED
AND HOPE FOR COOPERATION WITH
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
REGARDING THE RENEWAL AND
BUILDING OF A NEW ROAD
INFRASTRUCTURE, RAILWAY
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND ENERGY
INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH CONCERNING
ELECTRICITY AND THE TRANSMISSION
OF GAS IN CENTRAL EUROPE.
REFERRING HERE TO THE AREA
BETWEEN THE BALTIC STATES
THROUGH POLAND THE CHECK
REPUBLICAN AND SLOVAKIA, -- THE
CZECH REPUBLICAN, SLOVAKIA,
HUNGARY, AND THROUGH SLOVENIA TO
THE ADRIATIC SEA.
THIS IS THE SPACE WE WANT TO
DEVELOP AND OUR COOPERATION WITH
THE UNITED STATES A KEEN ASPECT
IN THIS.
ALSO AS FAR AS PROVIDING ENERGY
AND SECURITY IS CONCERNED TODAY
WE HAVE TALKED WITH LENGTH ABOUT
THIS WITH MR. PRESIDENT, WE ALSO
DISCUSSED THREATS TO ENERGY
SECURITY IN EUROPE TO THE
POSSIBLE DEVERSIFICATION OF
SUPPLIES.
WITHOUT ANY DOUBT THE BIGGEST
THREAT RIGHT NOW IS PROPOSED BY
THE CONSTRUCTION OF NORTH STREAM
TWO PIPELINE.
WE DISCUSSED THIS AT LENGTH WITH
MR. PRESIDENT.
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE TO BE
CLEAR AND SAY BOTH FROM THE
GERMAN AND RUSSIAN SIDE THIS
CONSTRUCTION HAS ALREADY BEEN
STARTED.
THERE IS STILL SOME FORMALITIES
GOING ON CONNECTED WITH THE
LENGTH OF THE PIPES AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE BALTIC SEA.
HOWEVER THIS INVESTMENT WITHOUT
ANY DOUBT THREATENS ENERGY
STABILITY OF EUROPE.
AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT IT
THREATENS POLISH ENERGY
SECURITY.
BECAUSE THERE IS A THREAT OF
RATION ENERGY DOMINATION
ESPECIALLY WHEN RUSSIA MENTIONS
THAT IT'S GOING TO BUILD MORE
PIPELINES, NORTH STREAM THREE,
NORTH STREAM FOUR.
THIS THREAT OF ABSOLUTE RUSSIAN
DOMINATION IN EUROPE IS OBVIOUS.
WHAT ARE THE RESULTS?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE WERE
ABLE TO SEE THAT OURSELVES IN
UKRAINE.
SUDDEN INTERACTION OF SUPPLIES,
OF COURSE IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH ECONOMIC FACTORS, IT WAS
CONNECTED ONLY AND EXCLUSIVELY
WITH POLITICAL BLACKMAIL.
IT WAS A FACT.
AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT TODAY WE
ARE MAKING EFFORTS AND WE ARE
GOING TO GO TO ANY LENGTHS TO
PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THAT.
THAT IS WHY WE DECIDED TO
CONSTRUCT AN LNG TERMINAL.
THAT IS WHY WE ALSO DECIDED TO
RECEIVE THE LNG GAS FROM THE
UNITED STATES.
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT WE HAVE
CONCLUDED SUCH CONTRACTS.
I AM GLAD THAT AMERICAN
COMPANIES ARE RIGHT NOW
DELIVERING LNG TO POLAND.
AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THANKS
TO THE LNG GAS TERMINAL, THANKS
TO EXPANDING ITS CAPACITY WE ARE
NOT ONLY GOING TO REALIZE AND
SAFEGUARD OUR OWN ENERGY NEEDS
BUT I ALSO HELP WE WILL BE ABLE
TO TRANSMIT GAS FURTHER TO OUR
NEIGHBORS THROUGH THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONSTRUCTION
OF INTERCONNECTERS.
THESE CONDITIONS WERE ALREADY
WELL RAISED IN OUR TALKS WITH
MR. PRESIDENT.
AND LASTLY WE LIKE TO INVITE
AMERICAN BUSINESS TO POLAND.
THERE ARE BETTER AND BETTER
INVESTMENT POSSIBILITIES.
OF COURSE THERE ARE COMPANIES
FROM THE UNITED STATES WHICH
HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN THE POLISH
MARKET FOR MANY, MANY YEARS LIKE
GENERAL ELECTRIC WHICH RIGHT NOW
IS IMPLEMENTING A HUGE
INVESTMENT CONCERNING ENERGY
SECTOR IN POLAND CONVENTIONAL
ENERGY SUCH AS THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE PLANT.
THESE ARE HUGE PROJECTS ALL
BEING REALIZED IN POLAND.
BUT I WANT TO INVITE ALL
BUSINESS PEOPLE.
THOSE WITH HUGE ECONOMIC
PROJECTS HERE AND HUGE
POSSIBILITIES OF INVESTMENT, BUT
WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO INVITE
SMALLER ONES.
POLAND IS A BIG EUROPEAN
COUNTRY.
I BELIEVE IT IS AN INTERESTING
PARTNER WHERE THE UNITED STATES
AND U.S. BUSINESS IS VERY MUCH
WELCOME AND I WANT TO ASSURE
YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ABOUT
THAT.
THERE IS ALSO A PERSPECTIVE OF
DEVELOPING THROUGH POLAND TO
INCLUDE THE THREE C'S COUNTRIES.
THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN
WORKING ON AS PART OF THE THREE
C'S INITIATIVE.
WE ALSO WANT TO INSURE THE
COMMUNICATION POSSIBILITIES AND
WE ALSO WANT TO INCREASE THE
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC
COOPERATION.
WE WANT ALSO BUSINESS PARTNERS
FROM THE U.S. TO JOIN OUR
PROJECTS TO BE A LOT OF
COMMUNICATION, TRAFFIC RELATED
INVESTMENTS IN OUR PART OF
EUROPE.
WE WOULD LIKE TO INVITE AMERICAN
BUSINESSES TO COME.
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS OPENS UP
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING JOINT
BUSINESS.
AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ALL OF
THAT IS CONNECTED WITH OF COURSE
THE ISSUE OF MILITARY SECURITY.
I'M DELIGHTED WITH THE PRESIDENT
ARMED FORCES IN POLISH
TERRITORY.
I'M DELIGHTED WITH THE ACTIONS
TAKEN IN WARSAW SUMMIT IN 2018
WHERE THE PRESIDENT OF THE
MILITARY FORCES OF NATO IN
POLAND WAS GUARANTEED.
I'M ALSO HAPPY THAT WE HAVE IN
POLAND AMERICAN SOLDIERS AS PART
OF OUR BILATERAL AGREEMENTS THAT
I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU, MR.
PRESIDENT, TO POST AMERICAN
TROOPS TO POLAND.
WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENCE OF
THE UNITED STATES IS A GAURANTOR
OF SECURITY.
AND MR. PRESIDENT TRUMP
MENTIONED THE SO CALLED AIR
DEFENSE SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES THE
PURCHASE OF PATRIOT MISSILES.
WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE LARGEST
MILITARY INVESTMENT SO FAR AS
THE POLISH FORCES ARE CONCERNED
OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS.
WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT MORE
PROJECTS, WE WANT TO BUY MORE
EQUIPMENT.
I'M CONVINCED THIS COOPERATION
BETWEEN POLAND AND THE UNITED
STATES WILL GO ON SMOOTHLY.
I HOPE THAT MR. PRESIDENT WILL
MAKE A DECISION TO DEPLOY TO
POLAND MORE U.S. UNITS TOGETHER
WITH EQUIPMENT.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WAS
SMILING WHEN TALKING TO MR.
PRESIDENT, I SAID THAT I WOULD
VERY MUCH LIKE FOR US TO SET UP
PERMANENT AMERICAN BASES IN
POLAND WHICH WE WOULD CALL FORT
TRUMP AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT
THIS IS POSSIBE.
I AM CONVINCED THAT SUCH A
DECISION LIES BOTH IN THE POLISH
INTEREST AS WELL AS IN THE
INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES.
POLAND IS AN ATTRACTIVE COUNTRY
AND FIRST AND FOREMOST IT'S GOT
A VERY IMPORTANT STRATEGIC
LOCATION IN EUROPE.
AND I'M CONVINCED THAT FOR THE
INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES
ALSO PERTAINING TO THE SECURITY
OF THE UNITED STATES ITSELF THE
PRESENCE OF THE U.S. FORCES IN
OUR COUNTRY IS IMPORTANT ALSO TO
PROTECT AMERICAN INTERESTS.
MR. PRESIDENT, ONCE AGAIN THANK
YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS MEETING.
THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR THIS
JOINT DECLARATION THAT WE'RE
ABLE TO SIGN TODAY.
THANK YOU FOR ALSO ADDING THIS
TO THE 10th ANNIVERSARY OF OUR
STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP.
>> THANK YOU.
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LNG WILL
BE EXPORTED TO POLAND.
WE'RE GIVING THEM A PRETTY GOOD
PRICE BECAUSE THEY'RE BUYING A
LOT OF IT.
THAT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.
I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WHILE
WE'RE TOGETHER TREMENDOUS EFFORT
AND BRAVERY IS BEING SHOWN IN
NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA,
VIRGINIA, AND THE AREA THAT WAS
SO HORRIBLY HIT BY HURRICANE
FLORENCE.
I JUST GOT SOME CLIPS OF SOME OF
THE THINGS THAT THE COAST GUARD
IS DOING AND GETTING PEOPLE TO
SAFETY AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE
CONDITIONS.
I WANT TO JUST SALUTE ALL OF THE
PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING SO HARD,
THE FIRST RESPONDERS, LAW
ENFORCEMENT, THE MILITARY, FEMA.
THE JOB THEY'RE DOING IS
INCREDIBLE.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK THEM
VERY MUCH.
AND I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS
WE'LL TAKE OUR FIRST QUESTION
FROM EMERALD ROBINSON OF ONE
AMERICA NEWS.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
SO NEWS TODAY OF A A RUSSIAN
PLANE SHOT DOWN OVER SYRIA.
RUSSIA IS ASSIGNING THE BLAME TO
ISRAEL EVEN THOUGH IT WAS
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT DOWN BY SYRIAN
FORCES.
THERE'S CONCERNS BY MANY
AMERICANS THAT WE MIGHT BE
INVOLVED IN A WAR IN SYRIA SOON.
YOU HAD HOPED TO BRING TROOPS
HOME BUT CLEARLY THINGS ARE
CHANGING.
WHAT DO YOU TELL AMERICAN PEOPLE
TODAY ABOUT A POSSIBILITY OF A
WAR IN SYRIA?
>> I JUST HEARD ABOUT THE
INCIDENT YOU HAVE MENTIONED,
EMERALD.
AND IT SOUNDS TO ME AND IT SEEMS
TO ME JUST LIKE BASED ON A
REVIEW OF THE FACTS THAT SYRIA
SHOT DOWN A RUSSIAN PLANE.
AND I UNDERSTAND ABOUT 14 PEOPLE
WERE KILLED AT LEAST AND THAT'S
A VERY SAD THING.
BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
BUT SYRIA, ACCORDING TO EARLY
REPORTS, THAT'S SUBJECT TO
CHANGE.
BUT THAT SYRIA SHOT DOWN A
RUSSIAN PLANE.
SO THAT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION.
WE HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB IN
SYRIA AND IN THAT REGION
ERADICATING ISIS WHICH IS WHY
WE'RE THERE.
AND WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO BEING
FINISHED WITH THAT JOB.
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A
DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO.
BUT WE HAVE ERADICATED ISIS IN A
VERY LARGE AREA OF THE MIDDLE
EAST.
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WILL NOT
BE COMING HERE BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOT AROUND ANY LONGER.
SO WE HAVE DONE IN A VERY SHORT
PERIOD OF TIME OUR VICE
PRESIDENT IS HERE, MIKE PENCE.
OUR GREAT SECRETARY OF STATE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE
GREAT JOB YOU'RE DOING, MIKE
POMPEO.
AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY
HARD ON THIS.
AND THEY HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE
JOB OVER THERE.
BUT WE'LL MAKE A DECISION FAIRLY
QUICKLY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE
PRESIDENT?
>> CERTAINLY.
THANK YOU, PRESIDENT DUDA.
CLEARLY YOU SAID YOU ASKED
PRESIDENT TRUMP IF HE WOULD
CONSIDER A PERMANENT BASE IN
POLAND AND THAT ALSO REALITIES
TO RUSSIA.
HOW DID THE PRESIDENT RESPOND TO
YOUR POSITION TO HAVE A
PERMANENT BASE FROM AMERICA IN
POLAND.
AND THEN ALSO DO YOU CURRENTLY
HAVE CONCERNS OVER THE U.S.
RUSSIA RELATIONSHIP?
>> WELL OF COURSE I TOLD MR.
PRESIDENT ABOUT ALL OF THE
ASPECTS CONNECTED WITH THE
PERMANENT PRESENCE OF THE U.S.
ARMED FORCES IN POLAND.
BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST I ASSURED
MR. PRESIDENT OF ONE THING.
FIRST AND FOREMOST, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, WE CANNOT SAY THAT IF
THERE ARE PERMANENT BASES OF THE
U.S. ARMED FORCES IN POLAND WE
WILL SEE A DETERIORATION OF
SECURITY BECAUSE THAT WILL LEAD
TO AN INCREASED RUSSIAN ACTIVITY
AND INCREASED MILITARIZATION OF
THIS PART OF EUROPE BY RUSSIA.
I WANT TO SAY IT CLEARLY, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
A VERY STRONG MILITARIZATION HAS
TAKEN PLACE FOR MORE THAN TEN
YEARS NOW.
IT IS THE REALITY THAT WE LIVE
IN TODAY.
AS FAR AS AN AGGRESSIVE RUSSIAN
BEHAVIOR IS CONCERNED, AS FAR AS
INCREASED RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES
RUSSIA HAS BEEN CONDUCTING SUCH
ACTIVITIES IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE
ABLE TO SEE THAT IN A
MATERIALIZED WAY IN GEORGIA
IN 2008 WHEN THE THEN PRESIDENT
OF POLAND TOOK OTHER EUROPEAN
LEADERS AND WENT TO STOP RUSSIAN
TANKS WHICH WERE ABOUT TO ATTACK
THE CAPITAL OF GEORGIA AND FROM
THAT MOMENT THAT MILITARY
EXPANSION HAS BEEN DEVELOPING.
IT'S OTHER LEG WAS THE ATTACK ON
UKRAINE AND TODAY WE CAN SEE AN
ILLEGAL ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA.
SO THESE ARE TODAY POLITICAL AND
MILITARY FACTS OF EUROPE.
AND THE PRESENCE OF THE UNITED
STATES IS ONLY PROVIDING A
GUARANTEE OF SECURITY AND A
POSSIBILITY TO DEFEND BECAUSE
LET ME REITERATE AGAIN IT IS
ONLY ABOUT THE GUARANTEE OF
SECURITY AND DEFENSE OF OUR PART
OF EUROPE THAT IS THE FREE
WORLD.
THIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL ISSUE
RIGHT NOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE,
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CENTRAL
AND EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND WE
ARE SPEAKING IN ONE VOICE ON
THIS ONE GENERALLY.
THAT IS WHY WE WANTED TO INSURE
THE PRESENCE OF THE U.S. ARMED
FORCES.
AND OF COURSE MR. PRESIDENT AND
HIS STAFF, HIS ADVISERS AND ALSO
THE PENTAGON STAFF HAVE TO
CONSIDER ALL OF THESE ISSUES BUT
THERE IS A WHOLE RANGE OF
ARGUMENTS WHICH ARE IN FAVOR OF
THE FACT THAT THE PRESENCE OF
THE U.S. ARMED FORCES IN THIS
AREA IS ABSOLUTELY JUSTIFIED
TODAY.
THAT IS DUE TO THE PROTECTION OF
THE INTEREST OF THE UNITED
STATES AS WELL.
SO I AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED OF
THIS ONE.
BECAUSE TODAY UNFORTUNATELY WE
ARE SEEING INTERNATIONAL LAW
BEING VIOLATED.
TODAY WE ARE SEEING AGGRESSIVE
BEHAVIORS, AND I'M CONVINCED
THAT THERE IS NO MORE EFFECTIVE
METHOD THAN PREVENTING A WAR
THAN A DECISIVE STANCE
DEMONSTRATING THAT WE ARE READY
ANY MOMENT TO REPEL A POSSIBLE
ATTACK.
AND THAT PRESENCE ALSO MEANS
DETERRENCE.
AT THE SAME TIME I AM CONVINCE
THAT HAD WHEN WE HAVE A STRONG
MILITARY PRESENCE IN THIS PART
OF EUROPE WHETHER AS A POTENTIAL
THREAT THEN THERE WILL BE NO WAR
HAPPENING EVER.
>> IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT
THE PRESIDENT SAID AND HE SAID
IT PUBLICLY THAT HE WOULD PAY
THE UNITED STATES, MEANING
POLAND WOULD BE PAYING BILLIONS
OF DOLLARS FOR A BASE.
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT MORE
AND MORE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF
DEFENDING REALLY WEALTHY
COUNTRIES AND NOT BEING
REIMBURSED, PAID, IT'S ONE THING
WHEN WE DEFEND COUNTRIES THAT
CAN'T DEFEND THEMSELVES AND
THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE AND WE
SHOULD HELP THEM.
WE DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING FOR
THAT.
BUT WHEN WE'RE DEFENDING
IMMENSELY WEALTHY COUNTRIES AND
THEY'RE NOT PAYING FOR THE
DEFENSE TO THE UNITED STATES
THEY'RE ONLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
US.
AND WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH
NUMEROUS COUNTRIES ALL OF WHOM
YOU KNOW ABOUT PAYMENT AND WE
GET ALONG WITH THEM VERY WELL.
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR.
THAT INCLUDES NATO.
AS YOU KNOW I GOT $44 BILLION
ADDITIONAL LAST YEAR.
WHERE THEY PAID AN ADDITIONAL,
YOU CAN SPEAK TO THE SECRETARY
GENERAL THE HEAD OF NATO.
HE SAID HE'S NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE IT.
AND THIS YEAR WE DID EVEN
BETTER.
WHEN A COUNTRY IS VERY WEALTHY
AND WHEN THE UNITED STATES HAS
BEEN PROTECTING THEM FOR MANY
YEARS AT TREMENDOUS COST, COSTS
LIKE NOBODY IN THIS ROOM WOULD
BELIEVE IT'S TIME THAT THEY HELP
WITH WE CALL IT BURDEN SHARING
AND THEY WILL DO THAT.
BUT THE PRESIDENT OFFERED US
MUCH MORE THAN $2 BILLION TO DO
THIS AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT IT.
WE'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM THE
STANDPOINT OF NUMBER ONE
MILITARY PROTECTION FOR BOTH
COUNTRIES AND ALSO COST.
A TERM YOU DON'T HEAR TOO OFTEN
BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GOT TO
BE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A
QUESTION PLEASE.
.
>> I HAVE A QUESTION TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
DO YOU SHARE THE CONVICTION
WHICH WE HAVE JUST HEARD A
MINUTE AGO EXPRESSED BY
PRESIDENT DUDA CONCERNING THE
THREAT WHICH IS POSED TO THE
REGION BY RUSSIA AND DO YOU ALSO
SHARE THE VIEW THAT PERMANENT
AMERICAN BASES IN POLAND ARE
JUSTIFIED NOT ONLY DUE TO THE
SECURITY OF THE COUNTRIES IN OUR
REGION BUT ALSO DUE TO THE
SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES?
>> I THINK IT'S A VERY
AGGRESSIVE SITUATION.
I THINK RUSSIA HAS ACTED
AGGRESSIVELY.
THEY RESPECT FORCE, THEY RESPECT
STRENGTH AS ANYONE DOES.
AND WE HAVE THE THE GREATEST
STRENGTH IN THE WORLD ESPECIALLY
NOW.
WE WERE BEING DEPLETED UNDER THE
LAST ADMINISTRATION.
WE HAD PLANES THAT WERE OLD AND
TIRED AND DIDN'T FLY IN SOME
CASES.
THIS IS THE UNITED STATES, THAT
DOESN'T HAPPEN, WE MAKE THE
GREATEST PLANES IN THE WORLD AND
MISSILES IN THE WORLD.
WE HAVE ENHANCED TO PUT IT
MILDLY OUR MILITARY.
IT'S LITERALLY BEING REBUILT AS
WE SPEAK WITH LITERALLY HUNDREDS
AND HUNDREDS OF PLANES AND
MISSILES AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU
CAN IMAGINE.
THEY NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD.
BECAUSE I GOT IN CONGRESS
$700 BILLION THIS YEAR.
$716 BILLION LAST YEAR.
THAT'S FAR MORE THAN THEY EVER
ANTICIPATED.
I VIEWED IT TWO WAYS.
NUMBER ONE, MILITARY BECAUSE
IT'S ALWAYS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
ANYTHING ELSE INCLUDING JOBS.
BUT NUMBER TWO IS JOBS.
WE MAKE EVERYTHING HERE.
SO IT'S HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
JOBS TO MAKE FOR US THE BEST
MILITARY IN THE WORLD.
AND RUSSIA RESPECTS THAT.
SO I AM WITH THE PRESIDENT.
I FEEL THAT HE'S RIGHT.
AND I FEEL THAT YOU LOOK AT THE
HISTORY OF POLAND AND RUSSIA.
I'D SAY LONG AND VERY
COMPLICATED HISTORY.
SO CERTAINLY IT HAS THE RIGHT TO
FEEL THAT WAY.
DO YOU HAVE THE FEELING THAT -- 
ARE THEY CLOSER TO BEING 
IMPLEMENTED? 
ARE THEY GOING TO BE A FACT? 
>> I DO. 
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MYSELF 
AND MR. PRESIDENT HAD A MEETING.
A PRIVATE MEETING. 
WE MET WITH OUR STAFF. 
WE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION, 
VERY HONEST DISCUSSIONS, AND 
VERY STRONG AT CERTAIN POINTS 
AS WELL. 
IN TERMS OF DIAGNOSIS OF THE 
SITUATION IN THE AREA OF 
MILITARY AND ENERGY SECURITY. 
I AM CONVINCED THAT ALL OF US 
ARE GOING TO DRAW APPROPRIATE 
CONCLUSIONS FROM THESE 
DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE, AS I SAID, 
BOTH SIDES PRESENTED THEIR 
POSITIONS AND MANY, ABSOLUTELY 
MANY, ELEMENTS. 
THEY ARE CONCURRENT AS FAR AS 
THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION 
CURRENTLY IS. 
WHAT KIND OF STEPS NEED TO BE 
TAKEN IN ORDER TO PROTECT BOTH 
THE ISSUE OF SECURITY AND THE 
ISSUE OF INTERESTS? 
THESE ARE BUSINESS RELATED 
ISSUES. 
I AM CONVINCED THAT, LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE 
THE RESULTS OF BOTH OUR 
MEETINGS TODAY AND OF THE 
DECLARATION THAT WE HAVE SIGNED 
TOGETHER WITH MR. PRESIDENT. 
OF COURSE, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
LONG-TERM PROCESSES SO I'M SURE 
THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HOW 
THIS IS GOING TO BE FILLED WITH 
CONTENT. 
YOU WILL SEE CONCRETE FACTS 
THAT WILL APPEAR ON THE MAPS 
AND ALSO IN AGREEMENT AND IN 
PURCHASES THAT ARE GOING TO BE 
REALIZED. 
>> JOHN DECKER, FOX. 
>> Reporter: THANK YOU, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU. 
ONE ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
ONE ENTRCE. 
ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH, YESTERDAY 
YOU SAID, WE WANT TO GO THROUGH 
A FULL PROCESS. 
YOU SAID WE WANT TO MAKE SURE 
THAT EVERYTHING IS PERFECT,  
EVERYTHING IS JUST RIGHT. 
TO THAT END, WHAT WOULD BE THE 
PROBLEM WITH THE FBI REOPENING 
THEIR BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION 
INTO JUDGE KAVANAUGH? 
WOULD YOU SUPPORT SUCH A THING? 
>> IT WOULD NOT BOTHER ME, 
OTHER THAN THE FBI, JOHN SAID, 
THAT THEY REALLY DO NOT DO 
THAT. 
THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY DO. 
THEY HAVE DONE SUPPOSEDLY SIX 
BACKGROUND CHECKS OVER THE 
YEARS AS JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS 
GONE BEAUTIFULLY UP A LADDER. 
HE IS AN INCREDIBLE INDIVIDUAL, 
GREAT INTELLECT, GREAT JUDGE, 
IMPECCABLE HISTORY IN EVERY WAY
. IN EVERY WAY. 
I FEEL SO BADLY FOR HIM, THAT 
HE IS GOING THROUGH THIS, TO BE 
HONEST WITH YOU. 
I FEEL SO BADLY FOR HIM. 
THIS IS NOT A MAN THAT DESERVES 
THIS. 
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT 
TO THE FORE. IT SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN BROUGHT UP LONG AGO. 
THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE HEARINGS 
FOR. 
YOU DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE 
HEARING IS OVER AND THEN ALL OF 
A SUDDEN BRING IT UP WHEN 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN SAT WITH JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH FOR A LONG PERIOD OF 
TIME, A LONG, LONG, MEETING. 
SHE HAD THIS LETTER. 
WHY DID SHE NOT BRING IT UP? 
WHY DIDN'T SHE BRING IT UP 
THEN? 
WHY DIDN'T THE DEMOCRATS BRING 
IT UP THEN? 
BECAUSE THEY ABSTRACT AND THEY 
RESIST. 
THAT IS THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST 
ME. 
THEY JUST RESIST AND THEY JUST 
ABSTRACT. 
AND FRANKLY, I THINK THAT THEY 
ARE LOUSY ON POLICY AND, IN 
MANY WAYS, THEY ARE LOUSY 
POLITICIANS, BUT THEY ARE VERY 
GOOD ON OBSTRUCTION. 
IT IS A SHAME. 
BECAUSE THIS IS A GREAT 
GENTLEMAN. 
WITH ALL OF THAT, I FEEL THAT 
THE REPUBLICANS, AND I CAN 
SPEAK FOR MYSELF -- WE SHOULD 
GO THROUGH A PROCESS, BECAUSE 
THERE SHOULD NOT EVEN BE A 
LITTLE DOUBT, NOT A DOUBT, AND 
AGAIN, THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE 
DOING. 
THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS A 
LONG TIME AGO. 
THREE MONTHS AGO. 
NOT NOW. 
BUT THEY DID IT NOW. 
SO I DON'T WANT TO PLAY INTO 
THEIR HANDS. 
HOPEFULLY THE WOMAN WILL COME 
FORWARD, STATE HER CASE. 
HE WILL STATE HIS CASE. 
BEFORE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE 
UNITED STATES SENATE. AND THEN 
THEY WILL VOTE. 
THEY WILL LOOK AT HIS CAREER. 
THEY WILL LOOK AT WHAT SHE HAD 
TO SAY. 
FROM 36 YEARS AGO. 
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
BUT I JUST THINK THAT HE IS AT 
A LEVEL THAT WE RARELY SEEM, 
NOT ONLY IN GOVERNMENT, BUT 
ANYWHERE IN LIFE. 
HONESTLY, I FEEL TERRIBLY FOR 
HIM. 
FOR HIS WIFE. 
WHO IS AN INCREDIBLE, LOVELY 
WOMAN, AND FOR HIS BEAUTIFUL, 
YOUNG DAUGHTERS. 
I FEEL TERRIBLY FOR THEM. 
>> ON TRADE, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU 
ANNOUNCED NEW TRADE TARIFFS 
AGAINST CHINA, AND TRADE 
TARIFFS ARE A VERY IMPORTANT 
PART OF YOUR TRADE AND ECONOMIC 
POLICY. 
IN YOUR FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE 
THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT 
INCREASED BY 12%. 
LAST MONTH, WE SAW THE TRADE 
DEFICIT INCREASE TO I BELIEVE 
IT WAS $72 BILLION. 
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IS YOUR 
POLICY WORKING? 
>> WE JUST STARTED. 
WE DID NOT DO ANYTHING WITH 
RESPECT TO CHINA BECAUSE WE 
WANTED TO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF 
CHINA HAVING TO DO WITH NORTH 
KOREA. 
THEY HAVE BEEN HELPFUL. 
I HOPE THEY ARE STILL HELPFUL. 
THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 
IT GOT TO A POINT WHERE THE 
NUMBERS ARE TOO BIG. 
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE FOR 
THE LAST 20 YEARS. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE WTO, WORLD 
TRADE ORGANIZATION, THAT IS 
WHEN CHINA HAPPENED LIKE A 
ROCKET SHIP, BECAUSE THEY TOOK 
ADVANTAGE OF THE RULES OF THE 
WTO. 
WHOEVER WAS STANDING AT THIS 
PODIUM IN THIS INCREDIBLE WHITE 
HOUSE IN THE OVAL OFFICE -- 
THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING 
ABOUT THIS LONG AGO. 
OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS, 
CHINA HAS TAKEN OUT OF THIS 
COUNTRY $500 BILLION AND MORE. 
 
$500 BILLION. 
THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY FOR 
POLAND, WOULDN'T IT? 
REBUILD YOUR WHOLE COUNTRY. 
THAT IS WHAT CHINA DID. 
THEY REBUILT THEIR COUNTRY WITH 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY 
POURING OUT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
I HAVE CHANGED THAT AROUND. 
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON.
OUR MARKET IS GOING UP LIKE A 
ROCKET SHIP AND I DO NOT WANT 
THEIR MARKET TO GO DOWN BUT 
THEIR MARKET IS DOWN 32% IN 
THREE MONTHS BECAUSE WE CANNOT 
LET THEM DO ANYMORE WHAT THEY 
HAVE DONE. 
I WATCHED TRADE DEFICITS, 
BECAUSE TO ME, DEFICITS ARE 
IMPORTANT. 
THEY ARE NOT EVERYTHING AND 
THEY ARE NOT EXACT. 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE A 
DEFICIT THAT IS NOT SUCH A BAD 
THING. 
WHEN YOU HAVE $375 BILLION IN 
TRADE DEFICITS AND THEN MANY 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND OTHER 
LIABILITIES OF ALL DIFFERENT 
TYPES, YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT IT. 
WE ARE THE PIGGY BANK TO THE 
WORLD. 
WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY CHINA
. WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY, 
EXCUSE ME, MR. PRESIDENT, THE 
EUROPEAN UNION, OF WHICH YOU 
ARE A PART OF. 
>>  
>> WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY 
EVERYBODY. 
I WANT TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN 
WORKER, THE AMERICAN FARMER, 
THE RANCHERS, THE COMPANIES, 
AND WE ARE NOT BEING RIPPED 
OFF. 
YOU WILL SEE IN A LITTLE WHILE. 
SPEAKING OF THAT, WE HAVE COME 
TO A CONCLUSION WITH MEXICO BUT 
WE HAVE A WONDERFUL DEAL FOR 
BOTH PARTIES. 
IT WAS A VERY ONE-SIDED DEAL. 
NOW IT IS A GOOD DEAL FOR BOTH 
PARTIES. 
I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT. 
THE NEW PRESIDENT HAD 
CONVERSATION, AND IT WAS 
TERRIFIC. 
I THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO 
HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 
WE WILL SEE. 
WE WILL SEE. 
WE WANT HELP ON THE BORDER 
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE WORST 
IMMIGRATION LAWS IN THE HISTORY 
OF MAN OR WOMEN KIND. 
WE HAVE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE 
IMMIGRATION LAWS. 
WE WANT HELP. 
WE HAVE COME TO A CONCLUSION 
WITH MEXICO. 
CANADA HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF 
HER COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME. 
WE LOVE CANADA. 
WE LOVE IT. 
WE LOVE THE PEOPLE OF CANADA. 
BUT THEY ARE IN A POSITION THAT 
IS NOT A GOOD POSITION FOR 
CANADA. 
THEY CANNOT CONTINUE TO CHARGE 
US 300% TARIFF ON DAIRY 
PRODUCTS. 
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. 
THERE IS A PROCESS. 
IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME. 
THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD NOT 
TALK TO US. 
THEY WOULD NOT TALK TO 
PRESIDENT OBAMA. 
THEY WOULD NOT EVEN TALK TO 
HIM. 
THEN I SAID, THAT IS OKAY. 
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TALK TO ME. 
JEAN-CLAUDE IS A TOUGH MAN. 
IS A VERY GOOD MAN. 
I LIKE HIM, BUT HE IS TOUGH. 
HE IS NASTY IS THE KIND OF GUY 
THAT I WANT NEGOTIATING FOR ME, 
BUT HE IS A TOUGH, TOUGH, 
COOKIE. 
AND I SAID TO HIM, WE HAVE TO 
RENEGOTIATE THE DEAL. 
HE SAID, BUT MR. PRESIDENT, WE 
ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE DEAL. 
WE DO NOT WANT TO RENEGOTIATE. 
I SAID, YOU MIGHT BE HAPPY WITH 
THE DEAL BUT I AM NOT HAPPY 
WITH THE DEAL. 
HE DID NOT WANT TO RENEGOTIATE. 
AFTER THREE TIMES, HE STILL DID 
NOT WANT TO RENEGOTIATE. 
I SAID, THAT IS OKAY. 
WE DO NOT HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE 
ANY LONGER. 
WE ARE GOING TO PUT A TARIFF ON 
ALL OF THE MILLIONS OF CARS 
THAT YOU SEND INTO THAN I DID 
STATES. 
HONESTLY, HE WAS IN MY OFFICE 
SO QUICKLY FROM EUROPE THAT I 
DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY HAD 
AIRPLANES THAT FLEW SO FAST. 
I SAID, WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS 
AIRPLANE? 
WE HAVE THE SEMBLANCE OF A 
DEAL. 
BECAUSE IT IS, TO A LARGE 
EXTENT, ECONOMICALLY ALL ABOUT 
CARS. 
CARS ARE A VERY BIG FACTOR. 
THEY SENT MILLIONS OF BMWS AND 
MERCEDES INTO OUR COUNTRY. 
WE ARE WORKING ON TRADE VERY 
HARD. 
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. 
HAS BEEN FOR 30 YEARS BUT I 
HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR THREE 
YEARS, STARTING WITH JAPAN. 
I TALKED ABOUT JAPAN. 
I WAS RIGHT. 
I TALKED ABOUT CHINA. 
I WAS RIGHT. 
THAT IS WHAT I DO. 
I LIKE DOING IT, BUT I LIKE 
DOING IT FOR THE PEOPLE. 
BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN 
ABUSED AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF 
BY VIRTUALLY EVERY COUNTRY THAT 
IT DOES BUSINESS WITH AND WE 
ARE JUST NOT LETTING THAT 
HAPPEN ANYMORE, AND THAT 
INCLUDES WHAT I SAID PREVIOUSLY 
ABOUT THE MILITARY. 
PLEASE. 
>> Reporter:  PRESIDENT, 
WELCOME BACK TO THE USA. 
AS IT RELATES TO THE U.S. AND 
EU RELATIONS, AS THE PRESIDENT 
MENTIONED, YOU ARE -- POLAND IS 
A PROUD MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN 
UNION. 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE U.S. AND 
EU RELATIONS RIGHT NOW? 
úDID YO 
THAT RELATIONSHIP? 
DID YOU CARRY A SPECIAL MESSAGE 
TO THE PRESIDENT? 
>> SIR, I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY, 
IF IT WAS POLAND IT WHICH WOULD 
DISRUPTED THAT TRADE BALANCE OF 
THE UNITED STATES. 
I REALLY WOULD BE HAPPY IF THAT 
WAS THE CASE. 
BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING AS FAR 
AS POLAND POLITICS IS CONCERNED 
AND CARING FOR THE MATTERS OF 
YOUR COUNTRY, IS SIMILAR TO THE 
VIEW OF PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT IS 
SAYING AMERICA FIRST AND I AM 
SAYING POLAND FIRST SO WE 
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER VERY 
WELL. 
IT IS HARD FOR ME TO BE 
SURPRISED OF THE FACT THAT MR. 
PRESIDENT, BEING A VERY 
EXPERIENCED MAN, A MAN OF 
SUCCESS, AS FAR AS BUSINESS IS 
CONCERNED, KNOWS HOW TO 
CALCULATE HE KNOWS HOW TO 
CALCULATE. 
I THINK THAT NOBODY PUTS OUT 
INTO QUESTION IN THE U.S. OR IN 
ANOTHER PLACE, AND HE TAKES 
CARE OF THE UNITED STATES AND 
IT LIES IN THE INTEREST OF THE 
COUNTRY TO HAVE A BALANCED 
TRADE EXCHANGE AND THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE 
CARE OF. 
OF COURSE THERE IS A CLASH OF 
INTEREST. 
HOWEVER, OBJECT LEE LOOKING, IT 
IS HARD NOT TO UNDERSTAND IT. 
THERE IS ALWAYS COMPETITION UP 
INTEREST, AND EVERY BUSINESS IS 
A COMPETITION OF INTEREST. 
I REPRESENT POLISH INTEREST 
WHEREAS PRESIDENT TRUMP 
REPRESENTS AMERICAN INTEREST. 
ON IMPORTANT MATTERS YOU HAVE 
TO STRIKE AN AGREEMENT TO MAKE 
SURE THAT BOTH COUNTRIES WIN 
AND LOSE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE 
AND THEN WE HAVE AN 
UNDERSTANDING, AGREEMENT, AND 
THAT WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE 
COOPERATING WITH EACH OTHER ON 
EQUAL LEVEL. 
I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE KIND 
OF COOPERATION THAT MR. 
PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. 
IT WOULD BE HARD TO BE 
SURPRISED WITH THAT. 
I AM LISTENING CALMLY TO THAT 
AND I WOULD LIKE POLAND TO BE 
SUCH A COUNTRY, SUCH AN 
ECONOMIC SUPERPOWER THAT IT 
WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT PART 
INTO THE UNITED STATES. 
I SAID JOKINGLY IN THE 
BEGINNING THAT I WISH THAT IT 
WAS POLAND WHICH DISTURBED THE 
TRADE BOUNDS OF THE UNITED 
STATES AND THE EXPORTS OF THE 
UNITED STATES BUT I BELIEVE 
THAT OUR COOPERATION WILL 
DEVELOP WELL ON PARTNERS AND 
PRINCIPALS. 
>> THE TRADE DEAL WITH SOUTH 
KOREA HAS BEEN FULLY 
RENEGOTIATED AND IT IS READY 
FOR THE SIGNATURE. 
WE MAY SIGN IT AT UNITED 
NATIONS OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER. 
IT WAS A TERRIBLE DEAL FOR THE 
UNITED STATES. 
NOW IT IS A FAIR DEAL. 
THAT HAS BEEN FULLY 
RENEGOTIATED IN ADDITION TO 
MEXICO AND SOME OF THE OTHERS 
THAT ARE VERY CLOSE BUT THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 
WE APPRECIATE YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU.
>> Reporter: DO YOU BELIEVE 
HER, SIR?  
>>> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING A JOINT 
NEWS CONFERENCE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF POLAND. 
HE MENTIONED BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THAT BY A 
FOX NEWS REPORTER. 
AFTER ALL OF THAT, HE, IN FACT, 
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE CABIN OR, 
IF THE ACCUSATIONS SHOULD BE 
HEARD, HE SAID THAT IT WOULD 
BOTHER ME BUT THE FBI SAID THAT 
THEY WOULD LOOK INTO IT. 
THAT WAS THE PRESIDENT ABOUT 
LAUNCHING THE FBI INVESTIGATION.
HE DID SAY, WHY DID THE 
DEMOCRATS BRING IT UP? 
THEY RESIST AND OBSTRUCT. 
HE SAID THAT THERE SHOULD BE 
EVEN LITTLE DOUBT, NOT EVEN 
DOUBT, TALKING ABOUT MOVING 
FORWARD ON THE NOMINATION. 
WITH THIS JUDGE BUT I WANT TO 
BRING IN THE WASHINGTON 
CORRESPONDENT PAULA REID WHO IS 
AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 
I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON 
THE PRESIDENT'S REACTION TO THE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH ACCUSATIONS. 
>> HE IS SUBDUED AND HE IS 
EMBRACING THE PROCESS AND 
TRANSPARENCY. 
HE WAS ASKED IF THE FBI SHOULD 
DO INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
CLAIM. 
AT THIS POINT THAT I PUT THIS 
IN HIS BACKGROUND CHECK FOLDER. 
AS THE PRESIDENT NOTED, THIS IS 
NOT WHAT THE FBI DOES. 
THIS IS NOT A FEDERAL CRIME. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE 
HANDLED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO 
IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE THE FBI 
IS GOING TO OPEN A FORMAL 
INVESTIGATION OF THE PRESIDENT, 
ONCE AGAIN, CRITICIZING 
DEMOCRATS FOR NOT BRINGING THE 
ISSUE UP SOONER. 
HE ALSO SAID THAT HE SUPPORTS 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND THINKS THAT 
HE IS EXTRAORDINARY. 
HE SAID THAT IF HE -- HE FEELS 
 
CONTINUED TO VERY CALMLY 
SUPPORT TRANSPARENCY AND A 
PROCESS AND OPPORTUNITY FOR 
THIS WOMAN TO BE HEARD, WHICH 
IS INTERESTING. 
HE HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY OVER A 
DOZEN WOMEN OF SEXUAL 
MISCONDUCT AND HAS NEVER 
SUPPORTED THE SAME KIND OF OPEN 
PROCESS FOR THAT. 
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS SAYING THAT 
DR. FORD CAN TESTIFY PUBLICLY 
OR PRIVATELY. 
DO WE KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT 
THAT? 
TRY WHAT I DID NOT LEARN 
ANYTHING FROM THIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE. 
BEFORE THIS STARTED, IT SEEMED 
TO BE AN OPEN QUESTION. 
HER ATTORNEY WAS TRYING TO PUT 
SOME LIMITATION ON THE EXTENT 
TO WHICH SHE WOULD BE ASKED 
ABOUT THIS. 
I KNOW THAT YESTERDAY, 
KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID ON BEHALF 
OF THE WHITE HOUSE THAT SHE 
BELIEVES THE ACCUSER SHOULD BE 
HEARD PUBLIC. SHE ALSO SAID 
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO TESTIFY BUT WAS NOT A 
SPECIFIC ABOUT IF THE WHITE 
HOUSE WAS ENCOURAGING HIS 
TESTIMONY TO BE PUBLIC. 
AT THIS POINT WE EXPECT BOTH OF 
THEM TO TESTIFY PUBLICLY IN 
ORDER TO SUPPORT WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WANTS, WHICH IS NOT 
TO LEAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THE 
ACCUSATIONS. 
CONNECT THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT 
IF THIS MATTER IS NOT SOMETHING 
THAT THE FBI LOOKS INTO. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
TRY ONE THAT IS TRUE. 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, SEXUAL 
CRIMES, ALLEGATIONS OF ANY SUCH 
THING IS USUALLY HANDLED AT THE 
STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. 
THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS WHEN 
IT COMES TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING 
BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE FBI 
WOULD NOT INVESTIGATE SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS. 
HOWEVER, THEY HANDLE IT IN 
TERMS OF HIS BACKGROUND CHECK. 
HE HAS BEEN THROUGH HALF A 
DOZEN OF THOSE. 
WHAT THE FBI SAID IS WHEN THEY 
LEARNED OF THIS, THEY PUT THE 
INFORMATION IN HIS FILE FOR HIS 
BACKGROUND CHECK. 
THERE IS NO CHANCE THAT THEY'RE 
GOING TO INVESTIGATE BECAUSE 
THERE IS NO ALLEGATION OF A 
FEDERAL CRIME. 
SOMETHING THAT IS HANDLED AT 
THE STATE LEVEL. 
>> EVEN THOUGH IT DOES NOT LOOK 
LIKE THE FBI WILL TAKE THIS UP 
AT THIS HOUR, THIS PUBLIC 
HEARING OR PRIVATE, HOWEVER IT 
MIGHT BE ON MONDAY -- SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN CAME FORWARD THING 
THAT THERE MUST BE MORE THAN 
JUST A JUDGE AND THE DR. FORD. 
DO YOU THINK THAT OPENING UP TO 
PERHAPS THE JUDGE THAT DR. FORD 
SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE 
IN THE ROOM AT THE MOMENT OR 
EVEN HER OWN PSYCHOLOGIST? 
TRY WHEN I THINK THAT THE MORE 
PEOPLE THAT YOU BRING IN, THE 
MORE CIRCUS LIKE IT WILL BE A. 
IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT THE CALL 
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IS IN FROM 
A LOT OF PEOPLE IS HOW THESE 
TWO PEOPLE,, SHARE PUBLICLY 
THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY. 
THIS IS NOT A TRIAL. 
NO ONE WILL BE CHARGED. 
THIS IS IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC 
OPINION AND PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR 
THE STORY AND HIS DEFENSE. 
ONCE YOU START BRINGING PEOPLE 
PROFESSIONAL POSITIONS AND 
PSYCHIATRISTS IN, THINGS GET A 
LITTLE COMPLICATED. 
AS YOU KNOW FROM COVERING LOTS 
OF HEARINGS, THE HEARINGS ARE 
ALREADY COMPLICATED AND 
CONSISTENT AS IT IS. 
>> ANY SENSE OF WHERE THE 
ACCUSATION IS GOING AT THIS 
POINT? 
CAN WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT IS 
HAPPENING WITH THE HEARING. 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY WE 
THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE TAKEN 
CARE OF IN THE HEARING AND WE 
WOULD HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES 
ANOTHER WOULD BE A VOTE IN THE 
WEEK. 
AT THIS POINT, WE DO NOT KNOW. 
IT IS STILL IN QUESTION. 
IF IT WILL BE PUBLIC OR 
PRIVATE. 
THE EXTENT TO WHICH SHE WILL BE 
OR THAT HER LAWYER WILL PREVAIL 
AND PUT RESTRICTIONS ON THE 
KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT SHE 
ASKED'S. 
AT THIS POINT IF SHE BECOMES 
THE ONLY ACCUSER TO COME 
HOWARD, THIS IS AN ACCUSATION, 
ALTHOUGH SERIOUS, FROM ABOUT 35 
YEARS AGO. 
HE DENIES IT. 
IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE 
SOMETHING AT THIS POINT THAT 
WOULD PUT HIS CONFIRMATION IN 
JEOPARDY. 
THAT IS PART OF WHY THE WHITE 
HOUSE HAS BEEN EMBRACING THEIR 
TRANSPARENCY PROCESS AND THEY 
SEEM CONFIDENT THAT HE WILL BE 
CONFIRMED BUT THEY DO NOT WANT 
TO LEAVE ANY SORT OF INDICATION 
THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO TAMP 
THINGS DOWN OR HIDE ANYTHING. 
THEY DO NOT WANT PEOPLE IN THE 
PUBLIC TO HAVE DOUBTS. 
AT THIS POINT, WE HAVE TO SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS. 
I HAVE LEARNED NOT TO MAKE 
PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN IN THIS TOWN. 
>> WELL SAID. 
PAULA REID, COMING TO US FROM 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 
WE HAVE A LOT MORE NEWS TO GET 
YOU. 
THIS IS CBSN.
