WON'T BE BLAMING IF THEY DON'T R

00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:14,994
WON'T BE BLAMING IF THEY DON'T N

9
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:16,695
OUT WELL FOR REPUBLICANS,

10
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:18,397
THEMSELVES.

11
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:20,599
>> IF THEY DON'T GO OUT AND VOTE

12
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,202
THEY HAVE THEMSELVES TO BLAME.

13
00:00:23,203 --> 00:00:27,039
>> Neil: FED IS DOING.

14
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,641
>> I THINK THE FED IS OUT OF

15
00:00:28,642 --> 00:00:30,242
CONTROL AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING

16
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:30,609
IS WRONG.

17
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,945
>> Neil: BUDGET DEFICIT

18
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:35,981
SOARING TO $775 BILLION.

19
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:38,584
IS NOT END OF

20
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:39,251
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, TRY THE

21
00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:40,619
OTHER END.

22
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,287
DISCORD IN THE WHITE HOUSE,

23
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:41,620
DON'T.

24
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:43,389
I'M A GUY WHO LIVES THERE.

25
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,323
PAINTED ON A LOT OF GUYS WHO

26
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:47,660
WORK THERE.

27
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:48,594
PUERTO RICO HURRICANE RECOVERY

28
00:00:48,595 --> 00:00:49,795
EFFORTS THAT WERE ALL HIM WHEN

29
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:50,696
THEY WERE GOING WELL BUT THEN

30
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:53,532
NOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM WHEN

31
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,201
HE DISCOVERED MAYBE THEY DIDN'T

32
00:00:55,202 --> 00:00:56,836
GO TOO WELL.

33
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:57,703
IT'S HUMAN NATURE TO SHIFT BLAME

34
00:00:57,704 --> 00:01:01,006
BUT IT'S SECOND NATURE TO THIS

35
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:02,041
PRESIDENT TO SHIFT SO MUCH

36
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:02,608
BLAME.

37
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,177
THE SHIFT HAS REALLY HIT THE FAN

38
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:05,878
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS

39
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,246
SHIFTING.

40
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:08,614
OWNING STRONG STOCK MARKET WAS

41
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:10,015
GOING ITS WAY ARE NOT PLANNING A

42
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:12,051
FINGER WHEN IT'S NOT GOING AWAY.

43
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:12,551
IF THAT IS LOCAL.

44
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:14,820
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT.

45
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:15,521
FED CHAIRMAN JEROME POWELL IS

46
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:16,622
THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE

47
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:16,956
ECONOMY.

48
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:23,996
NOT THE 0% INTEREST RATES THAT

49
00:01:23,997 --> 00:01:24,330
THAT --

50
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,831
JUST LIKE IT'S NOT THE FORMER

51
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:26,999
PRESIDENTS BULL MARKET, IT'S

52
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,201
HIS, EVEN THOUGH IT STARTED MANY

53
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:29,935
YEARS EARLIER BEFORE HIS, IT'S

54
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:33,172
CLEAR THOUGH THAT MARKETS GO UP

55
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:34,240
AND MARKETS GO DOWN.

56
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:35,274
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT MARKET ON

57
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:38,577
THE TRUMP HAVE GONE A LOT MORE

58
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:41,213
UP THAN THEY'VE EVER GONE DOWN.

59
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:42,815
WOULD IT KILL THIS PRESIDENT TO

60
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:43,816
HEED THE WORDS OF ANOTHER

61
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:45,117
PRESIDENT WHO HAD ANOTHER MARKET

62
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,086
THAT WAS GOING REALLY DOWN.

63
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:48,487
>> ALL THE OTHER THINGS I'VE

64
00:01:48,488 --> 00:01:51,290
TOLD YOU ABOUT THE ECONOMY ARE

65
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,827
AS SOLID AS I'VE TOLD YOU.

66
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:56,962
SO NO, I HAVE NO MORE KNOWLEDGE

67
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:58,597
OF WHY IT TOOK PLACE THAN YOU

68
00:01:58,598 --> 00:01:58,864
DO.

69
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:00,733
>> Neil: IT'S TOUGH TO BLAME

70
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,234
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO BUT IT'S

71
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:03,402
TOUGHER TO TAKE A BOW FOR

72
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:07,706
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT REGRET.

73
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:08,607
JOHN KENNEDY --

74
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:10,109
COULD HAVE BLAMED HIS MILITARY

75
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,412
ADVISORS, EVEN HIS PREDECESSORS

76
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:14,013
THE BAY OF PIGS FIASCO.

77
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:17,049
IN THE END, AS PRESIDENT, IT WAS

78
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,251
HIS FIASCO.

79
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:22,388
>> VICTORY HAS 100 FATHERS AND

80
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,223
DEFEAT IS AN ORPHAN.

81
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:27,993
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF

82
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:29,595
INFORMATION IS -- IN REGARD TO

83
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:30,796
THE RECENT ACTIVITIES.

84
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:32,164
>> Neil: LESSON LEARNED.

85
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:32,798
THE TROUBLE WITH POINTING

86
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:35,301
FINGERS AT OTHERS IS THAT SOME

87
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:37,069
OF THOSE OTHERS FEEL TEMPTED TO

88
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,037
POINT A FINGER AT YOU.

89
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:39,238
WHY SHOULD I STICK VALUE IF

90
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,007
YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO STICK IT TO

91
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:42,408
ME.

92
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:43,609
IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT LOYALTY.

93
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,243
IT WORKS BOTH WAYS.

94
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:46,045
TAKES A BIG MAN TO ACKNOWLEDGE A

95
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,112
MISTAKE BUT HERE'S THE REAL

96
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:48,881
DIRTY LITTLE TRUTH ON THIS.

97
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:52,017
THOSE WHO DO ALMOST ALWAYS SEE A

98
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,386
BIG JUMP IN THE POLLS.

99
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:55,321
WHETHER IT WAS JFK IN THE

100
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:58,924
BAY OF PIGS OR RONALD REAGAN AND

101
00:02:58,925 --> 00:02:59,725
IRAN CONTRA.

102
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:00,993
>> I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY

103
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:03,829
FOR MY OWN ACTIONS AND FOR THOSE

104
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,396
OF MY ADMINISTRATION.

105
00:03:04,397 --> 00:03:06,999
>> Neil: OR BARACK OBAMA IN

106
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
HIS OWN MIDTERMS.

107
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:12,838
>> WHAT HAPPENED ON TUESDAY?

108
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,839
>> Neil: OR BILL CLINTON

109
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,641
ACKNOWLEDGING THE OBVIOUS AFTER

110
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:16,842
THE NEWT GINGRICH REPUBLICAN

111
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:17,409
REVOLUTION.

112
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,877
>> THE ERA OF BIG GOVERNMENT IS

113
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:19,178
OVER.

114
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:20,613
>> Neil: DO YOU THINK CLINTON

115
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:21,347
WIDELY LEARNED YOU CAN SPITE THE

116
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:24,350
PARADE OR MAYBE YOU CAN TRY AND

117
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,185
LEAD IT, AND SO HE DID.

118
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:27,620
IT'S TOUGH WHEN THINGS DON'T GO

119
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:30,155
YOUR WAY BUT MR. PRESIDENT, THEY

120
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,024
ARE ONLY GOING TO GET TOUGHER

121
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:32,758
WHEN YOU KEEP PUTTING YOURSELF

122
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,425
IN THE WAY.

123
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:34,827
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH

124
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:35,661
BEING HUMAN.

125
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:38,397
THERE IS EVERYTHING WRONG WITH

126
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:40,199
TRYING TO CONVINCE OTHER HUMANS

127
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,633
YOU ARE NOT.

128
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:43,736
LET ME PUT THIS IN TERMS OF YOUR

129
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:45,471
LEGIONS OF LOYAL SUPPORTERS WHO

130
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:46,171
NO DOUBT SHARE WITH ME RIGHT

131
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:47,106
AFTER THE SHOW IN FACT THEY ARE

132
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:49,975
DOING SO NOW, IT WOULD BE LIKE

133
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,077
ME BLAMING MY BEING A TAD

134
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,113
OVERWEIGHT ON A THYROID

135
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:55,014
CONDITION.

136
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:56,448
FAT CHANCE ANY OF THEM WOULD

137
00:03:56,449 --> 00:00:00,000
EVER LET ME TRY IT BECAUSE I CAN
