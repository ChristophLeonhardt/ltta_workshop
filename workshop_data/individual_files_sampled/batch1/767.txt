since it was founded more than 200 years ago Suleiman eya in northern Iraq has been a city devoted to the Arts it's that celebrated legacy that makes it unsurprising that someone looked at this long abandoned and dilapidated tobacco factory and envisioned a sprawling Cultural Arts Center there is no doubt there will be a huge impact on the people of sulemani all Kurdish people know that people here are thirsty for art and culture and they are always participating in or holding cultural activities people even come here from other cities it has a special history from 1961 to 2005 Suleiman eya tobacco factory rolled out carton after carton of cigarettes including the first Kurdish brand the government-run factory was the second largest industry in the city's history it employed more than 1500 people but former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's persecution of the Kurds destroyed tobacco farming in northern Iraq these machines produce their last cigarette pack 13 years ago now the hope is this will become an arts hub where movie and television shows are produced musicians can practice and perform and artists create and show their work the cultural arts center will pay tribute to its historical roots the plan is to save these machines and create an exhibit devoted to the Suleiman a tobacco factory approaches in the beginning of the Cultural Center project we agreed that the exterior of the building will be preserved there will only be renovation inside there for the building remains as it was originally and the next generation will know that previously for more than 40 years this was a tobacco factory the Kurdistan Regional Government has allocated almost 6 million dollars to the project but no one can say how soon construction will begin in earnest let alone finish nice day let's do that now the economic situation is difficult but we hope that it will change and it should be better then we can overcome all the obstacles that we are facing when the Cultural Arts Center does open it promises to be a place where the history of Industry and the future of the Arts are preserved Natasha a guy named Al Jazeera Suleiman Asia northern Iraq
