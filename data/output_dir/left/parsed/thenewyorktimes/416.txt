The company, at a 167 years old, 
started in Bari Italy in 1850.
We like to say we do everything 
from the White House to the firehouse,
as far as the range of scale
and size of our firework displays.
There are many precautions that
we have to put in place
and write very meticulously
as a procedure in handling
any type of pyrotechnic or
explosive.
We have unfortunately had one
pretty severe, catastrophic
explosion within our facilities
back in 1983.
And unfortunately that incident took
the life of my father and my cousin.
It's the inherent nature of this business
that we're dealing with explosives,
we are dealing with a 
hazardous material.
We have great employees and we
make people happy with what we do.
