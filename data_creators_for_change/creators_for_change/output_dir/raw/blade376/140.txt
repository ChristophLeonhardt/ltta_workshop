00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,450
what do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the price of human</font>

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,700
life is how would you even define it I

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,590
mean what factors would you take into

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,380
consideration when considering such a

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,539
calculation well something I<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font>

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,789
very vividly was when i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> at secondary</font>

7
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,380
school was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> christian school we used to</font>

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,900
go down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the local church during the</font>

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,320
holidays and the vicar once talked about

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,890
a calculation he made when considering

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this question in which he took a list of</font>

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,270
all the materials<font color="#CCCCCC"> that make up the</font>

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,270
average human the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of potassium I</font>

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,850
don't know what he did but he concluded

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,120
it was less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred pounds and he</font>

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,980
straightway dismissed this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the worth</font>

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,829
of a human life surely we're worth more

18
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,140
than a hundred pounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a lot</font>

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,300
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different reasons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that life is</font>

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,520
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the physical existence of</font>

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,710
an individual source about the memories

22
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,930
they have the emotion<font color="#CCCCCC"> the connection</font>

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,459
they've had with people their abilities

24
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,130
their skills there are so<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess in a blunt way you know the</font>

26
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,740
price of<font color="#CCCCCC"> life could be determined by how</font>

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,920
much you'd be willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay to see that</font>

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">person for another day it is a choice</font>

29
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,600
that is hypothetical to so many people

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,330
but unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> a harsh reality to a</font>

31
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,460
few and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's to those many</font>

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,460
people a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps they do take</font>

33
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,650
covers for granted but then there's also

34
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact that we don't value all human</font>

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,689
life equally do we I mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should but</font>

36
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,720
we don't and why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that is</font>

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,890
perhaps it just comes down to the notion

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">of out of sight out of mind families</font>

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,470
friends neighbors people<font color="#E5E5E5"> within our</font>

40
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,899
close proximity whose emotions and

41
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,030
physical presence we get to experience

42
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,180
it's those people who directly affect us

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,600
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter to us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most one death is a</font>

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,380
tragedy 1 million is a statistic a very

45
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,439
true quote from<font color="#CCCCCC"> joseph stalin because</font>

46
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,020
realistically it is impossible for us as

47
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,300
individual human beings to mourn for

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,470
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> death</font>

49
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,310
cuz on this planet

50
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,810
so as I throw these ideas out there you

51
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,540
know what is the price of human life are

52
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">you starting to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel that that question</font>

53
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,989
is now irrelevant because ideally we

54
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:25,519
would live in a world where everybody

55
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,349
was taken care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and therefore we</font>

56
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,000
wouldn't be forced to have to make this

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,790
mental hierarchy in which we decide

58
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,040
whose lives are worth more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than others</font>

59
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,190
but unfortunately it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality that</font>

60
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">exists and actually occurs much more</font>

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,480
than you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> perceive as I've said</font>

62
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,400
before out of sight<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of mind and so</font>

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,079
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to end on a story which is an</font>

64
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,660
example of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a friend of mine was</font>

65
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,040
once on a train sitting next to a

66
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">businessman who looked quite sad and</font>

67
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,750
therefore out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of curiosity began a</font>

68
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,730
conversation with him to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out why he</font>

69
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,220
was and it turned out that he worked for

70
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,379
a car company a car<font color="#E5E5E5"> company which had</font>

71
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,730
found a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fault in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of their</font>

72
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,099
manufactured parts therefore they

73
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,440
decided to recall all of the cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,750
had this problem but they knew about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

75
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,150
problem for two years and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why he</font>

76
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided to leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the company and that's</font>

77
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,530
why he was sad and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason it took</font>

78
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,480
two years was because there is a

79
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,049
calculation they use they find out based

80
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:26,930
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fault in the car how many people</font>

81
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,549
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely to die as a result and</font>

82
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:30,889
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> they calculate how much money</font>

83
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:33,079
would have to be paid to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the families of</font>

84
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,870
those that have died they then calculate

85
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,810
how much it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would cost to recall all of</font>

86
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,780
the cars that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the fault and if the</font>

87
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of money they would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay</font>

88
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,459
the families for the deaths due to the

89
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,660
fault if that money was less than how

90
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,340
much it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would cost to recall the cars</font>

91
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,690
then they let people die

92
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,360
and they only began recalling<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cars</font>

93
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,460
because the balance are changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

94
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,510
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually gonna be cheaper in the</font>

95
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,720
long run to recall the cars quite

96
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:15,460
chilling if you ask me and therefore I

97
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,110
leave you with this thought because I

98
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think we should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asking</font>

99
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,890
ourselves what is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> price</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the human</font>

100
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,810
life the question we should be asking in

101
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,900
society today is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> causes us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask</font>

102
00:04:25,900 --> 00:00:00,000
such a question in the first place
