NEW YORK. 
WE ARE WAITING FOR A PRESS 
CONFERENCE FOR THE SOUTHERN 
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE TALKING 
ABOUT CHRIS COLLINS WHO TURNED 
HIMSELF IN EARLIER TODAY. 
I'M NOT SURE IF THIS HAS 
ALREADY STARTED. 
OKAY. IT HASN'T STARTED YET. 
AS SOON AS IT BEGINS, WE'LL 
BRING IT TO YOU LIVE. 
HELLO, EVERYONE. 
I AM ANNE-MARIE GREEN.  
HE HAS BEEN INDICTED ON PRIDE 
-- FRAUD CHARGES AND WILL BE 
ARRAIGNED LATER ON TODAY.
HE IS ACCUSED OF USING INSIDER 
INFORMATION ON A BIOTECHNOLOGY 
COMPANY TO MAKE ILLICIT TRADES. 
PAUL RYAN ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT 
COLLINS WILL NO LONGER SERVE ON 
THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE 
COMMITTE. 
EARLIER, I SPOKE TO ED O'KEEFE 
ABOUT THE CHARGES.
>> REPORTER: PROSECUTORS ARE 
EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE MORE 
DETAILS TODAY. 
THE CONGRESSMAN IS EXPECTED TO 
ADDRESS THESE LATER ON. 
THEY ARE ALLEGING THIS IS TIED 
TO HIS CONNECTIONS, HIS 
INVESTMENT,  IN A COMPANY . 
THIS HAS BEEN PERCOLATING FOR 
ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF. 
AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT POINTS 
OUT THAT SOME OF THE ACTIVITY 
MAY HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE 
2017 WHITE HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL 
PICNIC. 
THERE WERE PHONE CALLS TO HIS 
SON WHO WAS ALSO INDICTED. 
AND ANOTHER PERSON, THE FATHER 
OF THE CONGRESSMAN SON'S 
FIANCC 
IN A STATEMENT, THEY SAY THEY 
WILL ANSWER THE CHARGES IN 
COURT.  
THEY WILL MOUNTIE VIGOROUS 
DEFENSE.
THEY SAY THAT THEY ARE 
CONFIDENT HE'LL BE VINDICATED 
AND PLAN TO SAY MORE TODAY. 
WHO WAS CHRIS COLLINS? 
HE IS ONE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
BIGGEST OFFENDERS ON CAPITOL 
HILL. 
HE WAS ALSO ONE OF HIS EARLIEST 
SUPPORTERS. 
HE HAS KNOWN HIM FOR QUITE SOME 
TIME.  
>> THIS IS A LIVE SHOT OF NEW 
YORK. 
THEY ARE SAYING THIS HAD TO DO 
WITH A FAILED DRUG TEST THAT 
THIS COMPANY DID. 
SO WHEN THIS BEGINS, WE'LL 
BRING THAT TO YOU LIVE. 
YOU CAN SEE THEY HAVE AN 
OUTLINE OF WHAT HAPPENED WHEN. 
WE'LL BRING THAT TO YOU SHORTLY.
>>> ALSO, ED ADDRESS THE SPECIAL
ELECTION IN OHIO. 
TROY BALDERSON CLAIMED VICTORY. 
BUT HE LEADS BY JUST 1700 
VOTES. 
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT? 
HE LEADS OVER DANNY O'CONNOR 
BUT 8000 BALLOTS STILL HAVE TO 
BE COUNTED. 
ED O'KEEFE DISCUSSES WHAT WE 
HAVE LEARNED LOOK AHEAD TO 
NOVEMBER IN THE MIDTERMS. 
>> Reporter: THIS IS A 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WHERE IN 
2016, THE INCUMBENT WON BY 36 
POINTS. 
REPUBLICANS HAVE HELD THE SEAT 
SINCE AN EARLY 1980S. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WON BY 11 
POINTS. 
REPUBLICANS SHOULDN'T BE IN A 
SITUATION WHERE THEY ARE 
WINNING A SPECIAL ELECTION BY 
LESS THAN 1%. THE DEMOCRATS 
WERE ABLE TO GET THIS CLOSE. 
AND THEY ARGUE THERE ARE 
DISTRICTS THAT ARE FAR MORE 
COMPETITIVE THAN THIS ONE WERE 
REPUBLICANS ARE THE INCUMBENT 
URBAN TROLLING THE SEAT AND 
THEY BELIEVE IF THEY CAN DO IT 
HERE, THIS IS A SIGN THAT IT 
WILL HAPPEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
COME NOVEMBER. 
>> YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO 
VOTERS. 
WHAT ARE THEY TELLING ABOUT WHY 
THEY BACKED THE CANDIDATES THEY 
BACKED? 
>> Reporter: THEY SEE SUPPORT 
FOR THE SUBVERSION -- THE 
PRESIDENT AS IMPORTANT. 
DEMOCRATS THEY PART OF THE 
REASON THEY SHOWED UP IS 
BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT HE HAS 
BEEN UP TO. 
I DON'T LIKE HIS TEMPERAMENT OR 
AGENDA. 
WANT TO SEE A DEMOCRAT ELECTED 
AND THEM RE-TAKE OVER THE HOUSE.
IT WAS TELLING. 
WE SPOKE WITH ONE WOMAN ON 
ELECTION DAY WHO TOLD US SHE 
HAD BEEN PLANNING TO 
PARTICIPATE. 
SHE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO VOTE 
BUT SEEING THE PRESIDENT COME 
HERE ON SATURDAY FOR TROY 
BALDERSON  MADE HER SO 
DETERMINED TO SHOW UP, SHE SET 
A NOTIFICATION AND WROTE VOTE 
FOR ELECTION DAY. 
SAYING, I WANTED TO DO 
EVERYTHING I COULD TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
ROBBED OF THE SEAT. 
>> THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. 
AS YOU KNOW AND AS PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TWEETED EARLIER, 
CONGRATULATING TROY BALDERSON  
BUT ALSO TAKING CREDIT FOR 
SHIFTING THE RACE IN HIS FAVOR. 
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT
HIS PRESENCE HAD ALREADY
DEMOCRATIC VOTER BUT I'M 
WONDERING ABOUT REPUBLICANS. 
WERE THEY ENERGIZED BY HIM 
COMING AND CAN WE SORT OF 
EXTRAPOLATE ANYTHING FROM THAT 
ABOUT WHAT SORT OF IMPACT HE 
MIGHT HAVE ON THE RACES IN 
NOVEMBER? 
>> REPORTER: SO WHEN WE TALKED 
TO TROY BALDERSON ABOUT THIS 
THE OTHER DAY --THERE WERE SOME 
HE SAID IT MOTIVATED VOTERS TO 
HAVE THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE 
PRESIDENT COME IN THE LAST FEW 
DAYS OF THE RACE.  
PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY HAVE A 
POINT.
HE WAS IN ESSENCE THE CLOSER. 
HE WAS ABLE TO TELL HIS 
COALITION YOUR BEEN THERE FOR 
ME, BE HERE FOR THIS GUY. 
ULTIMATELY IF IT IS LESS THAN 
1%, IT PROVES THAT YES, HE 
CONTINUES TO BE A BIG HELP FOR 
DOWN BALLOT REPUBLICANS. 
AND IF HE PULLS IT OFF, YOU ARE 
GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOW UP ALL 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
HE IS HEADED TO NEW YORK NEXT 
WEEK TO HELP TWO INCUMBENT 
REPUBLICANS THERE. 
THE DEMOCRATS THINK THEY CAN 
GET AT LEAST ONE OF THEM. 
TED CRUZ IN TEXAS IS TALKING 
OPENLY ABOUT HAVING PRESIDENT 
TRUMP COME HELP HIM IN A RACE 
THERE. 
HE VOWS TO CAMPAIGN AS OFTEN AS 
HE CAN IN THE FINAL TWO MONTHS 
OF THE SEASON. 
>> IF YOU THOUGHT THIS RACE WAS 
NICE, DON'T FEAR WHAT THEY'LL 
BE DOING IT TWICE. 
BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES WILL 
BE MATCHED UP AGAIN IN 
NOVEMBER. 
CAN WE EXPECT ANYTHING 
DIFFERENT? 
>> REPORTER: I LIKE THE 
RHYMING, ANNE-MARIE.  
>> I TRY. 
>> Reporter: THE DIFFERENCE 
WILL PROBABLY BEBECAUSE IT IS 
BEING HELD ON ACTUAL ELECTION 
DAY, TRADITIONAL ELECTION DAY, 
THE TURNOUT MODEL THAT PEOPLE 
ARE ACCUSTOMED TO WILL PROBABLY 
TAKE EFFECT. 
YOU WILL SEE FAR MORE 
REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY SHOW UP TO 
VOTE. 
IT IS EARLY AUGUST. 
PEOPLE ARE STILL ON VACATION.  
SCHOOL HASN'T STARTED YET.
BOTH SIDES ARE GRIPING ABOUT 
THE FACT THAT THIS WAS BEING 
HELD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
SUMMER. 
THE MAY HAVE A POINT. 
THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS KNOW IT 
WILL BE HARDER FOR O'CONNOR TO 
GET AHEAD COME NOVEMBER IF OR 
WHEN THERE IS A REMATCH. 
THEY BOTH SECURED THE 
NOMINATIONS.  
SOTHE VOTERS OF THIS DISTRICT 
ARE GOING TO KEEP HEARING FROM 
THEM FOR THE NEXT 90 DAYS OR 
SO. 
>> BOOK YOUR HOTEL STAY, ED 
O'KEEFE. 
>> REPORTER: WE ARE HERE AT 
LEAST ONE MORE DAY.  
>>> WE ARE GOING BACK TO A 
PRESS CONFERENCE. 
CHRIS COLLINS HAS BEEN CHARGED 
WITH SECURITY FRAUD. 
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN. 
>> HE LIED ABOUT IT TO LAW 
ENFORCEMENT TO COVER IT UP. 
ALSO CHARGED IS HIS SON, 
CAMERON COLLINS AND THE FATHER 
OF CAMERON'S FIANCC 
THESE CHARGES ARE REMINDER THAT 
THIS IS A NATION OF LAWS AND 
THAT EVERYBODY STANDS EQUAL 
BEFORE THE BAR OF JUSTICE. 
NOT LIKE TO GO INTO THE DETAILS 
OF THE ALLEGATIONS A LITTLE 
MORE. 
IN ADDITION TO SERVING IN THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS WAS ALSO ON 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF A 
COMPANY THAT IS PUBLICLY TRADED 
THAT WAS DEVELOPING A DRUG FOR 
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. 
IN JUNE 2017, CONGRESSMAN 
COLLINS WAS TOLD SOME 
CONFIDENTIAL AND HIGHLY 
SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
COMPANY. 
INFORMATION THAT WAS NOT YET 
MADE PUBLIC. 
NAMELY THAT THE MAIN DRUG, THE 
DRUG THEY WERE DEVELOPING TO BE 
THE BACK BONE OF THE COMPANY 
WAS A TOTAL FAILURE. 
THIS WAS DEVASTATING 
INFORMATION FOR THE COMPANY. 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS HAD AN 
OBLIGATION TO KEEP THAT 
INFORMATION SECRET UNTIL THAT 
INTERMISSION WAS RELEASED BY 
THE COMPANY TO THE PUBLIC. 
HE DIDN'T KEEP IT SECRET. 
INSTEAD, AS ALLEGED, HE DECIDED 
TO COMMIT A CRIME. 
HE PLACED HIS FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS ABOVE THE PUBLIC GOOD. 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS WAS A MAJOR 
INVESTOR AND SO IS HIS SUN -- 
SON. 
THE CONGRESSMAN KNEW HE 
COULDN'T SELL HIS OWN SHARES 
FOR PERSONAL AND TECHNICAL 
REASONS INCLUDING THAT HE WAS 
ALREADY UNDER AN INVESTIGATION 
REGARDING INNATE  BY THE 
CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS OFFICE. 
THE CRIME THAT HE COMMITTED WAS 
TO TIP HIS SON SO THAT CAMERON 
AND A FEW SELECT OTHERS COULD 
TRADE ON THE NEWS WHILE THE 
INVESTING PUBLIC REMAINED IN 
THE DARK. 
AS THIS ALLEGES, THAT'S EXACTLY 
WHAT THEY DID. 
HIS SON, SOLD. 
HIS FIANCC SOLD. 
THE FATHER OF THE FIANCC SOLD. 
HIS WIFE SOLD. 
OTHER FRIENDS AND RELATIVES 
SOLD. 
AND THIS WAS ALL BECAUSE 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS VIOLATED 
HIS DUTY TO KEEP INNATE'S 
INFORMATION  SECRET. 
AND WHEN THE NEWS BECAME PUBLIC,
THE STOCK PLUMMETED. 
THE CONSPIRATORS USED THE 
INSIDE INFORMATION TO AVOID 
OVER $750,000 IN LOSSES. 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS COULDN'T 
KEEP HIS CRIME A SECRET FOR 
EVER. 
THE FBI ASKED TO INTERVIEW HIM 
AND INSTEAD OF TELLING THE 
TRUTH, HE LIED. 
AND SO DID CAMERON COLLINS. 
AND SO DID STEPHEN ZARKSY.  
BY LYING TO THE FBI, THEY 
COMPOUNDED THE CRIME WITH THE 
CRIME OF CRIMINAL COVER-UP. 
NOW I WOULD LIKE TO GO OVER THE 
CHARGES THAT SUMMARIZE SOME OF 
THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE 
INDICTMENT. 
THIS IS A TIPPING CHAIN. 
IT DEMONSTRATES THE FLOW OF THE 
ILLEGAL INSIDER INFORMATION AND 
THE TRADING OF THAT INFORMATION.
AT THE TOP OF THAT CHAIN WAS 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS.  
SHE RECEIVED CONFIRMATION -- 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. 
IN TOTAL, THE DISREGARD OF THAT 
OBLIGATION, MINUTES AFTER 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS  RECEIVED 
THE DEVASTATING, HIGHLY 
CONFIDENTIAL NEWS THAT INNATE'S 
DRUG HAD FAILED THE TRIAL, 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS  TIPPED 
THAT INSIDE INFORMATION TO HIS 
SON SO THAT HIS SON COULD TRADE 
IT. 
CAMERON COLLINS, WHEN HE 
RECEIVED THAT ILLEGAL INSIDE 
INFORMATION, HE DID TWO THINGS. 
BOTH OF WHICH ARE ILLEGAL. 
HE SOLD STOCK BASED ON THAT 
INSIDE INFORMATION AND AVOIDED 
$570,000 IN LOSSES. 
AND HE ALSO TOOK THAT ILLEGAL 
INSIDE INFORMATION AND TIPPED 
OTHERS. 
HE TIPPED HIS FIANCC. HE 
TOPPED -- TIPPED HIS FIANCC'S 
FATHER AND A FRIEND. 
ALL OF WHOM TRADED ON THAT 
ILLEGAL INSIDE INFORMATION. 
STEPHEN ZARSKY AVOIDED $143,000 
IN LOSSES BY TRADING ON THAT 
INFORMATION. 
AND HE TIPPED OTHERS. 
HE TIPPED HIS BROTHER. 
HE TIPPED HIS SISTER. 
AND HE TIPPED A FRIEND. 
TWO OF WHOM TRADED ON THE 
INFORMATION. 
ONE ATTEMPTED TO TRADE ON THE 
INFORMATION BUT WAS UNABLE. 
IN TOTAL, THE CONSPIRATORS 
AVOIDED LOSSES OF OVER $768,000 
ALL BECAUSE OF THE INITIAL 
ILLEGAL INSIDER TRADING TIP BY 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS.  
IN THIS CHART, WE SET SOME OF 
THE KEY ALLEGATIONS IN THE 
INDICTMENT AGAINST A BACKDROP 
OF THE INNATE  SHAREPRICE. 
ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 22, 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS  WAS AT A 
CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC AND AT 
SIX: 55, HE RECEIVED AN EMAIL 
FROM THE CEO OF INNATE  
INFORMING HIM OF THE HORRENDOUS 
NEWS THAT THE DRUG HAD FAILED 
ITS TRIAL. 
AT 7:10 P.M., CONGRESSMAN 
COLLINS RESPONDED  TO THAT 
EMAIL. 
AS THIS ALLEGES, AT LEAST AT 
7:10 PM, CONGRESSMAN COLLINS 
WAS AWARE  OF THE INSIDE 
INFORMATION. 
A MINUTE LATER, CONGRESSMAN 
COLLINS  ATTEMPTED TO CALL HIS 
SON. 
IN A PERIOD OF FIVE MINUTES, 
THERE ARE SIX UNSUCCESSFUL CALLS
. ON THE SEVENTH CALL AT 7:16 
P.M., CONGRESSMAN COLLINS  
ILLEGALLY TIPS HIS SON ABOUT 
THE DRUG TRIAL RESULT SO THAT 
HIS SON COULD TRADE ON THOSE 
RESULTS. 
LATER THAT EVENING, AFTER 
CAMERON COLLINS HAS THE ILLEGAL 
TRADING INFORMATION, CAMERON 
COLLINS DRIVES WITH HIS FIANCC 
TO HIS FIANCC'S PARENT'S HOUSE.
THEY ARRIVE AT THE HOUSE AT 
9:17 P.M. 
LESS THAN 20 MINUTES LATER IT 
9:30 4 PM, -- 9:34, THE FIANCC 
IS ON THE PHONE TO BEGIN THE 
PROCESS OF SELLING HER SHARES 
OF INNATE.  
THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 23, AT 
7:42, CAMERON COLLINS BEGINS 
THE PROCESS OF SELLING HIS 
SHARES OF INNATE. CAMERON 
COLLINS SELLS APPROXIMATELY 
1.39 MILLION SHARES OF INNATE 
PRIOR TO THE MARKET CLOSING ON 
JUNE 26. 
AFTER THE MARKET CLOSES, INNATE 
ANNOUNCES TO THE PUBLIC THAT 
THE DRUG HAD FAILED THE TRIALS. 
AND THE NEXT DAY, THE DRUG 
PRICE, THE PRICE OF INNATE 
FALLS OFF A CLIFF. 
IT DROPS 92% IN VALUE IN A 
SINGLE DAY. 
THIS WAS THE DROP THAT WAS 
ANTICIPATED BY THE CO-
CONSPIRATORS, THIS WAS THE DROP 
IN VALUE THAT THEY AVOIDED BY 
SELLING THEIR SHARES BEFORE THE 
PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT. 
AND THEY COULD ONLY SELL THOSE 
SHARES BY VIRTUE OF THE INITIAL 
TIP OF INSIDE INFORMATION BY 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS.  
A CASE OF THIS TYPE AND 
SIGNIFICANCE OBVIOUSLY INVOLVES 
THE SEC AND THE FBI IN THEIR 
REPRESENTATIVES ARE STANDING UP 
HERE WITH ME TODAY. 
TO MY LEFT IS MIKE GOOD FRIEND 
BILL SWEENEY -- MY GOOD FRIEND 
BILL SWEENEY. 
AND TO THE FAR LEFT IS JOHN 
BROSNAN, THE SPECIAL AGENT IN 
CHARGE OF THE FBI NEW YORK 
OFFICE CRIMINAL DIVISION. 
THE WORK ON THIS CASE WAS 
SPECTACULAR AND I WANT TO THANK 
THEM FOR THEIR PROFESSIONALISM 
AND DEDICATION. 
WE WORK WITH THE FBI ON SO MANY 
IMPORTANT CASES. 
IT IS ALWAYS A PRIVILEGE. 
TO THE LEFT OF BILL'S STEPHANIE 
-- BILL IS STEPHANIE. SHE IS A 
CODIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF 
ENFORCEMENT. 
I WANT TO THINK THE SEC FOR 
THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS MATTER. 
LAST, I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND 
THANK THE CAREER PROSECUTORS IN 
MY OFFICE HANDLING THE CASE. 
TO MY RIGHT, IS MAX NICHOLAS, 
DAMIEN WILLIAMS, BOB ALLEN, 
SCOTT HARTMAN, AND THE CO-CHIEFS
OF THE SECURITIES AND 
COMMODITIES FRAUD TASK FORCE, 
TIM AND JASON COLEY. 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS  WHO BY 
VIRTUE OF HIS OFFICE HELPS TO 
WRITE THE LAWS OF THE NATION, 
ACTED AS IF THE LAW DIDN'T APPLY
TO HIM. 
THE CHARGES TODAY DEMONSTRATE 
ONCE AGAIN THAT NO MATTER WHAT 
THE CRIME AND NO MATTER WHO 
COMMITTED IT, WE STAND COMMITTED
IN THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE 
WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOR. I WOULD 
NOW LIKE TO INVITE TO THE PODIUM
BILL SWEENEY. 
>> THANK YOU, JEFF. GOOD 
AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. 
CHRISTOPHER COLLINS SAT ON THE 
BOARD OF DIRECTOR S FOR A SPAN 
OF MORE THAN 3 YEARS. 
COLLINS WAS THE LARGEST 
SHAREHOLDER IN THE COMPANY. 
IN OR ABOUT THE SUMMER OF 2017, 
A DRUG DESIGNED TO TREAT 
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ENTERED THE 
LATE STAGES OF THE CLINICAL 
TRIAL. 
THIS DRUG WAS THE ONLY VIABLE 
DRUG IN THE PIPELINE FOR INNATE.
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT IN THE FACT 
THAT THE VALLEY WAS NEARLY 
COMPLETELY WRAPPED UP IN THE 
SUCCESS OF THIS TRIAL. 
ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 22, 2017,
COLLINS RECEIVED AN EMAIL 
INFORMING HIM THAT THIS DRUG 
HAD FAILED THE CLINICAL TRIAL. 
RECORDS INDICATE HIS INITIAL 
SHOCK AT HAVING RECEIVED THE 
NEWS. 
THE DRUG ONCE ANTICIPATED TO 
HOLD BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF 
VALUE WOULD NOW BE THE CAUSE OF 
SIGNIFICANT LOSS FOR INNATE AND 
ITS INVESTORS, MANY OF WHOM 
SHARED A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP 
WITH CONGRESSMAN COLLINS.  
WHILE HE WAS LEGALLY BOUND TO 
KEEP THIS INFORMATION 
CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL THEY WERE 
RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC FOUR 
DAYS LATER ON JUNE 26, WE 
ALLEGE THAT HE DID NOT. 
THE INDICTMENT CHARGES THAT HE 
IMMEDIATELY BEGAN CONTACTING 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS HE HAD 
BROUGHT INTO THE FOLD. 
THIS SET OFF A RIPPLE EFFECT IN 
WHICH MANY INVESTORS DIRECTLY 
OR INDIRECTLY CONNECTED TO 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS WERE 
NOTIFIED.  
MOST OF THEM 
>> SOLD THE SHARES. ú-- QUICKLY 
CONSPIRATORS SAVED THEMSELVES 
OVER $750,000 IN LOSSES. 
COLLINS HIMSELF, HAVING BEEN 
PROHIBITED FROM SELLING HIS 
SHARES FOR VARIOUS REASONS, DID 
NOT AVOID THE FINANCIAL LOSS. 
DESPITE THIS FACT, HIS ALLEGED 
ACTIONS BROUGHT HIM FACE-TO-
FACE WITH FEDERAL AGENTS WOULD 
BECOME OF THE WORK. 
WHEN QUESTIONED BY LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ABOUT THE DEALINGS, 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS , HIS SON, 
STEPHEN ZARSKY, LIED PLAIN AND 
SIMPLE. 
TODAY, THEY ARE CHARGED WITH 
INSIDER TRAINING AND LYING TO 
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS. 
COLLINS MAY HAVE THOUGHT THAT 
GIVING HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS A 
HEADS UP ABOUT MATERIAL 
NONPUBLIC INFORMATION WOULD 
BENEFIT THEM IN THE LONG RUN, 
HERE'S A BETTER TIP FOR THOSE 
WHO THINK THEY CAN PLAY BY A 
DIFFERENT SET OF RULES. 
ACCESS TO THIS KIND OF 
INFORMATION CARRIES WITH IT 
SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY. 
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE IN SOCIETY 
WHO HOLD A POSITION OF TRUST. 
ACT HONORABLY AND IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH THE LAW AND DO NOT LIKE TO 
SPECIAL AGENTS OF THE FBI. 
MANY THANKS TO OUR PARTNERS 
ESPECIALLY JEFF AND YOUR TEAM 
OF PROSECUTORS. 
YOUR WORK IS BEEN EXCEPTIONAL. 
TO THE SEC I WANT TO THANK 
STEPHANIE AND STEPHEN. 
TO JOHN, AND TO YOUR TEAM 
ESPECIALLY, I WANT TO EXTEND MY 
PERSONAL APPRECIATION. 
SOME ARE IN THE BACK BUT NICK, 
JOHN, ELENA, AND TRACY, YOUR 
WORK HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONAL. 
WHAT YOU DO MATTERS IT MAKES A 
DIFFERENCE. 
THANK YOU. 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE TO 
THE PODIUM STEPHANIE, 
CODIRECTOR OF ENFORCEMENT AT 
THE SEC. 
>> THANK YOU. 
GOOD AFTERNOON. 
AS JEFF SAID, MY NAME IS 
STEPHANIE AND I AM CODIRECTOR 
OF THE DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT. 
BEFORE I BEGIN, I WOULD LIKE TO 
THINK JEFF BERMAN AND HIS 
PROSECUTORS AS WELL AS THE FBI 
WHO WORKED ON THIS MATTER. 
TODAY, THE SEC FILED CHARGES 
AGAINST CONGRESSMAN COLLINS , 
HIS SON, AND THREE OTHERS 
ALLEGING THAT THEY ENGAGED IN 
INSIDER TRADING AHEAD OF 
INNATE'S  ANNOUNCEMENT OF 
NEGATIVE DRUG RESULTS. 
CHRISTOPHER COLLINS LEARNED OF 
THE NEGATIVE NEWS IN HIS PASTY 
AS A MEMBER OF -- HIS CAPACITY 
OF A MEMBER OF THE BOARD. 
IN ADDITION TO CAMERON COLLINS 
SELLING NEARLY 1.4 MILLION OF 
HIS OWN INNATE SHARES, HE IS 
ALLEGED TO  HAVE TIPPED HIS 
GIRLFRIEND, HER MOTHER, AND HER 
FATHER, DEFENDANT STEPHEN 
ZARSKY. 
THE SEC  FURTHER ALLEGES THAT 
STEPHEN ZARSKY FURTHER TIPPED 
HIS SIBLING AND A FRIEND. 
THE SEC'S  COMPLAINTS SEEK 
DISGORGEMENT, INTEREST, AND 
PERMANENT INJUNCTIONS. 
THE SEC ALSO SEEKS  BARRING 
CHRISTOPHER COLLINS FROM SERVING
AN OFFICER OR DIRECTOR OF A 
PUBLIC COMPANY. 
BEING A DIRECTOR IS A 
PRIVILEGE. 
A PRIVILEGE THAT COMES WITH 
RESPONSIBILITIES. 
CHRISTOPHER COLLINS IS ALLEGED 
TO HAVE ABUSE THIS PRIVILEGE 
AND BREACHED HIS 
RESPONSIBILITIES BY ENGAGING IN 
ILLEGAL INSIDER TRADING. 
LAUREN AND DOROTHY ZARKSY  HAVE 
EACH AGREED TO SETTLE THE 
CHARGES AGAINST THEM. 
BY CONSENTING TO INJECTIONS, 
DISGORGING THE GAINS AND PAYING 
PENALTIES. 
LAUREN ZARKSY  HAS ALSO GREAT 
TO BE SUSPENDED FROM PRACTICING 
BEFORE THE COMMISSION AS AN 
ACCOUNTANT FOR A PERIOD OF AT 
LEAST 5 YEARS. 
ACCOUNTANTS WHO ENGAGE IN 
ILLEGAL TRADING SHOULD NOT 
SEARLE -- SERVE. THESE ARE 
SETTLEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO 
COURT APPROVAL. 
NOW LET'S TURN THIS OVER TO 
STEPHEN FOR ADDITIONAL REMARKS. 
>> THANK YOU, STEPHANIE. 
FIRST OFF, I WOULD LIKE TO 
COMMEND EXCELLENT WORK OF THE 
STAFF MEMBERS WHO HAVE HANDLED 
THIS INVESTIGATION. 
KOBE STEEL, PATRICK McCLUSKEY, 
MELISSA ARMSTRONG, AND CHERYL 
CRUMPTON. 
THEY INSIDER-TRADING 
ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IS A GREAT 
SUCCESS. 
WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DETECTED 
AND PURSUED SCHEMES OF ALL 
SHAPES AND SIZES. 
FROM NATIONAL PLANS TO CYBER 
INTRUSIONS TO THOSE PERPETRATED 
BY SINGLE FAITHLESS INSIDER. 
IN THE PAST 5 YEARS ALONE, 
THANKS TO THE HARD WORK OF THE 
STAFF, IT'S EVER DEVELOPING 
EXPERTISE AND ITS USE OF HIGHLY 
EFFECTIVE REPAIR TERRY 
ANALYTICAL TOOLS -- PROPRIETARY 
ANALYTICAL TOOLS, THEY HAVE 
FILED MORE THAN 450 INDIVIDUAL 
CASES. 
TODAY'S CASES ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
DEDICATION AND KNOW-HOW. 
AT THE HEART OF THE SECTION, AS 
DESCRIBED IN THE COMPLAINT, AS 
A TIPPING CHAIN THAT EXTENDS 
FROM CONGRESSMAN COLLINS  TO 
CAMERON COLLINS TO MEMBERS OF 
THE ZARKSY FAMILY AND BEYOND.  
WHEN MEMBERS OF THE MARKET 
ABUSE UNIT, SPECIALIZED GROUP, 
UNCOVERED SUSPICIOUS TRADING 
BIKE CAMERON COLLINS, THEY DID 
NOT STOP THERE. 
AS IT HURT, THEY IDENTIFIED 
TRAINS -- TRADES BY PEOPLE 
CLOSE TO HIM. 
IN ADDITION TO THE TRAINING, 
THE STAFF WORKED ALONGSIDE THE 
TALENTED PROSECUTORS HERE IN 
THE DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND 
THE DEDICATED MEN AND WOMEN OF 
THE F VI -- FBI. 
THAT RECORD WHICH IS SUMMARIZED 
IN THE COMPLAINT CONSISTS OF 
EMAILS AND TEXT MESSAGES, CELL 
PHONE RECORDS. 
TRADING DATA, COMMUNICATIONS 
INCLUDING RECORDED CALLS WITH 
BROKERAGE FIRMS AND OTHERS. 
REFLECTS FRANTIC EFFORTS BY 
TIPPERS TO CONVEY INSIDE 
INFORMATION AND TRADERS TO SELL 
THE INNATE SHARES BEFORE  THE 
NEGATIVE ANNOUNCEMENT. 
AS ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT, 
THE DEFENDANTS ACCOUNTED FOR 
OVER HALF OF THE ENTIRE TRADING 
VOLUME ON THE FIRST TRADING DAY 
AFTER THEY GOT THE NEWS AND 
CAMERON COLLINS HIMSELF 
ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN HALF OF 
ALL THE INNATE SHARES ON  THE 
NEXT DAY. 
INSIDER-TRADING IS NOT JUST 
ILLEGAL, IT IS ALSO CORROSIVE. 
IT THREATENS INVESTOR CONFIDENCE
IN THE FAIRNESS AND INTEGRITY 
OF THE MARKETS. 
FOR THE MARKETS TO RETAIN THE 
PLACE AS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD, 
THE SEC AND COLLEAGUES  MUST BE 
VIGILANT IN POLICING AGAINST 
THIS MISCONDUCT. 
THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN THIS SORT 
OF BEHAVIOR SHOULD KNOW THAT WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO DEVOTE 
RESOURCES, EXPERTISE, AND 
ENERGY TO FINDING THEM AND 
SEEKING TO HOLD THEM 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
THANK YOU. 
>> WE'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. 
YES. 
>>  
>> THERE IS NO ALLEGATION OF A 
WIRETAP IN THIS CASE. 
AND WITH RESPECT TO THE DETAILS 
OF THE EVIDENCE THAT ARE NOT 
CONTAINED IN THE INDICTMENT, 
POLICY RESTRICTS ME SO I'M NOT 
GOING TO GET INTO PROOF OF 
TRIAL. 
>> IS IT TRUE THAT [ 
INDISCERNIBLE QUESTION ] 
>> THAT IS NOT AN ASPECT OF 
THIS INDICTMENT. 
I HAVE NO COMMENT. 
>>  
>> THE INDICTMENT ALLEGES ON 
THE EVENING OF JUNE 22, 2017, 
WHEN CONGRESSMAN COLLINS  
RECEIVED THE INFORMATION VIA AN 
EMAIL FROM THE CEO OF INNATE  
THAT HE WAS AT THE 
CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC AND THAT 
IT WAS FROM THAT PICNIC THAT HE 
THAT TRIED TO REACH HIS SON. 
SIX ATTEMPTS IN FIVE MINUTES. 
ON THE SEVENTH ATTEMPT HE GOT 
THROUGH TO HIS SON. 
IT IS ALLEGED THAT HE LEGALLY 
RELAYED THE RESULTS OF THAT 
DRUG TEST SO THAT HIS SON COULD 
TRADE ON THAT INFORMATION. 
AND THAT WAS ALL DONE AS 
ALLEGED IN THE INDICTMENT AT 
THE CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC. 
>>  
>> THE INDICTMENT DOES NOT 
SPECIFY THE PHONE THAT HE USE. 
I DON'T THINK I'M ALLOWED TO GO 
OUTSIDE THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE 
INDICTMENT. 
>>  
>> I HAVE NO COMMENT ON THAT. 
>> I JUST WANT TO GET A BETTER 
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW -- IS AS A 
REFERRAL TO -- 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO 
HOW THIS WAS REFERRED TO THE 
OFFICE. 
YES. 
>> THE COMPLAINT SAYS THAT HE 
SPOKE WITH HIS SON WITH THE 
EXPECTATION THAT HE WOULD THEN 
-- HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT PROVING 
THAT ANTICIPATION WAS KNOWING --
DO YOU HAVE TO PROVE THE 
KNOWING? 
>> YES. 
INDICTMENT ALLEGES THAT THE 
CONGRESSMAN CONVEYED THE 
ILLEGAL INSIDE INFORMATION 
ANTICIPATING THAT HIS SON WAS 
GOING TO TRADE ON THAT 
INFORMATION. 
I CAN'T GET INTO THE EVIDENCE 
OF TRIAL RIGHT NOW. 
I CAN'T GO BEYOND THE FOUR 
CORNERS OF THE INDICTMENT. 
>>  
DOES YOUR OFFICE HAVE ANY 
CONCERNS ABOUT -- POLITICALLY 
MOTIVATED? 
>> POLITICS DOES NOT ENTER INTO 
THE DECISION-MAKING ON CHARGING 
A CASE. 
WE BRING A CASE WHEN THE CASE 
IS READY TO BE BROUGHT. 
THAT BEING SAID, WE ARE 
COGNIZANT OF THE POTENTIAL 
CONCERNS SURROUNDING AN ELECTION
BUT HERE WE ARE MONTHS AWAY 
FROM THE ELECTION AND THOSE 
CONCERNS DO NOT APPLY. 
>  
>>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO A 
PRESS CONFERENCE HERE IN NEW 
YORK. 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS  IS FACING 
INSIDER-TRADING CHARGES. 
BASICALLY THE STORY ACCORDING 
TO THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS THAT
HE WAS A LARGE SHAREHOLDER IN A 
DRUG COMPANY. 
THAT COMPANY WAS FOCUSED ON 
CREATING A DRUG TO TREAT 
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, MS. BUT THE 
TESTS FAILED. 
ACCORDING TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY, 
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS  GOT THAT 
INFORMATION. 
BUT BECAUSE HE WAS HOLDING SO 
MANY SHARES, HE DID NOT SELL 
THE SHARES HIMSELF. 
BUT HE TOLD HIS SON, HIS SON'S 
FIANCC HIS FUTURE FATHER-IN-LAW
, AND THEY ALL SOLD THEIR 
SHARES TO AVOID DOWNTURN OF THE 
STOCKS. THEY MANAGED TO AVOID 
ABOUT $750,000 IN LOSSES. 
THOSE OF THE ALLEGATIONS RIGHT 
THERE. 
AND THEN THEY WERE QUESTIONED 
BY THE FBI. 
ACCORDING TO THE U.S. 
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, THEY LIED 
ABOUT THIS. 
THAT IS WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT
