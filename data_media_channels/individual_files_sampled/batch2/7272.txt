Steve Bannon now apparently going to testify in fact some of that testimony has begun but that one is in Congress and he's not alone some of the presidents top advisors being called in drums let's explain President Donald Trump's former chief strategist according to HuffPost Steve Banta will meet behind closed doors on Tuesday with a US House of Representatives Committee that is probing whether Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election hold he's not set to meet that was earlier today he has already met but wait in the middle of meeting with the house here's what happened bana was on Capitol Hill testifying this is according to CNN testifying before the House Intelligence Committee when news broke that Muller had issued the subpoena for the nowis trained associate of President Donald Trump to testify before a grand jury now the reason why this is relevant is because Steve Bannon now has nothing to gain from Donald Trump and from conservatives now that doesn't mean that he's changing his political ideology certainly doesn't mean I know what he said behind closed doors whether it's to the house or eventually to Muller but Trump and all other conservatives threw him under the bus in the most dramatic irreversible way you could imagine so now that he has nothing to gain from them he has no reason to protect them now he might protect him anyway based on ideology or perhaps he doesn't actually know anything but if he does know something and he seems to have no hope for recovery and his political war media career he's also been fired from Breitbart under pressure from the president another conservative allies well he could talk now he said earlier and it was quoted in the book is saying that oh no he's not going to talk and he's not gonna testify and he doesn't need a lawyer guess what he lawyered up because it turns out when Muller comes a-callin as Special Counsel or even the house does committee okay you're gonna need a lawyer so when that lawyer tells them hey by the way it's you or your former allies who now not only despise you but have publicly ridiculed shamed and ridden you out of town I'm not sure that's that tough a call so see how that goes down but it could be a lot of trouble for the president if he's got a loose banning on his hands okay anyways but he's not alone here comes more former Trump advisors later in the week to panel we'll hear from former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski now he is very loyal to the president and not one known for being overly honest but a lot of this stuff is on on the record and so we'll see to what degree they're willing to skirt the issues let's put it that way and by the way it's possible that any one of these people doesn't know anything about Russian meddling or was not involved some members of the campaign and administration might have been involved while others were not so now we're not we're not done yet White House communications are right to hope picks who served as Trump spokeswoman during his presidential campaign after a tenor with the Trump Organization real estate business is also expected to be questioned by the committee this week according to a congressional source so we got a lot of testimony coming up by the way it might be because the Republicans are rushing to wrap this thing up but when you go to testify there are Democrats there too and they could ask tough questions and ones that perhaps they're not either prepared for or if first of all they're part of the Trump administration of course they won't be prepared okay but even if you were if you lie on the record you're gonna have massive problems again we don't know if any of these individuals necessarily does know any connections with Russia and I suppose there's a possibility that nobody did anything with Russia that's of course not true we already know Carter page went to Russia we know Papadopoulos try to go to Russia we know Papa dollops already pled guilty we already know Mike Flynn pled guilty the only question is who else was involved and the scope of that and did it in fact Donald Trump hope Acheson Lewandowski though and Bannon at a certain time were among his closest advisors so if anyone knew something it might be them and by the way not done with Hicks she is reportedly already sat for an interview with Special Counsel Robert Muller's team so I guess Donald Trump better that hope floats that doesn't even make any sense you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
