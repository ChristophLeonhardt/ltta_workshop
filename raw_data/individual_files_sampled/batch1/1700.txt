our success in negotiations roughly one year after taking over the al-qaida Airport in southeastern Yemen the Saudi UAE coalition has agreed to give up control it will now hand it back to local civil authorities it's the first such move in Yemen civil war and the decision follows months of protests from local tribes al mualim a denier well my dad right we were given control of the airport on Friday morning public hall the runway and all the civil aviation gates this is a positive step from Saudis military force in macra having control of the airport is one of the six demands issued by protesters in eastern Yemen this victory is inspiring other communities to take action in the city of tase people are calling attention to other problems with local governments from corruption to lack of security three years into the war thousands have been killed entire communities displaced the fight between Houthi rebels and government forces backed by the Saudi UAE coalition continues in other parts of the country getting control of Al Qaeda's Airport is important for those who live in the area and hotel asthma one hope that song we pray this will be the end of the crisis in the end of the protests we also hope that our brothers in Saudi Arabia will appreciate the demands of micro residents and not repeat these actions but some political analysts believe the gesture is mainly symbolic and will have little impact on the ground there needs to be serious steps for coalition forces to hand over the lands paratus and the all the airports in Yemen rather than just give me one airport and expecting it to be a success story for that despite handing over supervision of the airport the Saudi Emirati coalition still controls most of Mara province and leading to the entire south of Yemen that is currently under control the coalition a seemingly small yet significant move in a battle with a long road ahead Charlotte Bellis al Jazeera
