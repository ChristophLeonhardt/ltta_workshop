this is testimony we've said it before though teams that are already out of the competition they're still giving their all it means a lot to them to be at this World Cup and twice Costa Rica went behind against Switzerland twice they pegged them back to two it ended and it was a pretty good game to watch this Peter so it was it was very entertaining and all other goals I have to say if I'm if I was a Costa Rica coach I'd be quite proud of my team they've come in we did say this once the draw was made we called this a good but there this was but has shown to be by a long way in the most difficult group but it ended up pretty much like everybody had and I'm sort of predicted with Brazil winning it Switzerland going through in a second some people said Serbia but they're you know everyone had to work really hard but and Switzerland everything went to plan Switzerland were first on the score sheet and you know everything was was going their way real and bollo scored the first goal and and then we can see that here this is how to put the ball in the back in it with some venom yeah just just kick it in don't think about it don't give anybody a chance to put a foot up or anything I suspect he doesn't score too many goals because he clearly relished the opportunity do you do you think his celebrations were great I enjoy that's how I would be doing it if I was scoring smash it and then really revel in the moment Kendall Westin we've raided us Watson but it was less than equalized for Costa Rica and then we had a game and it was it became a game Costa Rica really went for the win a fantastic header and it needed a fantastic finish to bead of really well playing and some on the Swiss goal he was excellent for the first five minutes he had two massive saves and one of them I'm putting my neck on the line here I haven't I've only seen it watch it watch it from here and broadcasting but it looked to be one of the saves of the tournament so I get back to my hotel I was seen one more time and then I'll let you know if I still think that tomorrow but in the first five minutes Costa Rica could have gone easily in there easily have gone to nil there to Neela and they didn't but there then I know I just wanted to point out I liked Washington celebration there he took his shirt half off yeah probably knowing it's a booking if you take it off so you just gave everyone a flush of half of it or so clever thinking so we're going on what looked like it would be the winner 88 minutes Switzerland back in front yo sit Dermot with this one took that nicely in his stride what a finish days he's just come on the page what a you know fresh off the bench you know I don't think he's had many churches there it comes in and the finish and I tell you people don't know how difficult that was the technique that requires to put the ball with that pace with the size foot on a ball that comes to or show with that accuracy that was a that was a fantastic finish now the next finish that we're going to talk about is you know sometimes it isn't that easy to be a goalkeeper and when FIFA changed their own goal rules first of all the referee was quite happy to give a penalty to to Costa Rica right at the end and he gave one two minutes before that that the accident cancel out foresight eventually they got the penalty but you know when it comes off the bar and hits the goalkeeper in the head and he goes in well it's written down as a go an own goal by the goalkeeper and when you read back in two weeks you probably can't remember that it hit the bar you think oh did he make a mistake so anyway yeah through the ruse will be obviously wanting to claim that goal but as far as you're concerned it and somehow God has to be if it hadn't hit the enzyme what he would have gone out and open play and the situation would then have been solved a resolve but because you know it goes in the go for the gold very unfortunate he's sort of going here as you said to produce some good he's got nothing to be embarrassed about so you see Brazil very very comfortable gone through this group that was a difficult start for them they played 1-1 was twisted in the first game and everybody saw it well priscila gonna struggle here but they they happened seven points Switzerland he I mean they really had to mess up today yeah but they got a tough match now because they going to play Sweden in the last 16 in saint-petersburg July 3rd so even though they'd done well to get through it's a it's a tough reward for them you
