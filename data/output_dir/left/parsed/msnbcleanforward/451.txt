it's no secret what side of the aisle
I've spent most of my career on you and
I are the two non-practicing Republicans
in this conversation but a lot of what I
see now doesn't represent the Republican
Party I knew how the Republicans get out
from under being a Putin loving anti FBI
party in fact it's unrecognizable what
they did today leaked a weakness the
times we live in call for people of all
parties to transcend that affiliation
and call it like this yes gently White
House with Nicole Wallace we dated for
on MSNBC
