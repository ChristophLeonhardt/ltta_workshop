00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">I buzzfeed thing take one</font>

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,900
sensational I<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally got around to</font>

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,240
watching this BuzzFeed video that

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,020
everyone has been just and I was trying

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">to avoid actually really was trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,880
just avoid the video altogether because

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,040
you know I don't want to be upset for

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the day so but I couldn't have what it</font>

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,029
is just you know everyone's talking

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,950
about it given their two cents on it I

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,230
watched Evelyn's video on it and of

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,960
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> she had me just cackling into the</font>

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,390
Oblivion with her response<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watched it</font>

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:45,020
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main problem i have with</font>

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,990
the video is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that most of the</font>

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,990
answers to a lot of those questions is

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,380
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily white supremacy all that</font>

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,840
being said I think the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that I</font>

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:04,640
can say about the video is that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,960
when i watch the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video what I see is</font>

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,749
myself from about six years ago six or

22
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:16,880
seven years ago I see myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of</font>

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">those people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are in that video</font>

24
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:21,259
because you know they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of on this</font>

25
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:23,119
it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like self-deprecating it's</font>

26
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like borderline anti blackness a</font>

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,539
little bit it's you know it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

28
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:28,039
bit of just like the self-loathing the

29
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">self-hatred or just like just like a</font>

30
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:31,340
hint<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it you know just like a hint of</font>

31
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,119
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that I know that feeling</font>

32
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">all too well because I used to have a</font>

33
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,479
lot of those same sentiments I

34
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,090
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> did because I grew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up in you</font>

35
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,219
know a middle-class suburban

36
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:46,039
neighborhood in Texas and just

37
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,450
geographically there weren't many of us

38
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,520
where I grew up and then the black

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,189
people that were there you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside</font>

40
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:55,700
of the church that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I grew up with you</font>

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,009
know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them would look at me and</font>

42
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:00,229
say I wasn't black enough or they felt

43
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:01,969
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was imitating some sort of</font>

44
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:03,829
whiteness because I spoke a certain way

45
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:07,130
or I enjoyed school or things of that

46
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,990
nature and so it was awkward for me

47
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,068
there's just there was definitely this

48
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:13,459
duality that I faced in you know not

49
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,640
being black enough for the black

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">community where I grew up but none sure</font>

51
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,710
as hell no one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I why</font>

52
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,140
either and just not really knowing where

53
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,420
I fit in and I struggled<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that and</font>

54
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,360
because of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i did harbor</font>

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,280
some sort the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of animosity</font>

56
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,320
that I think you see in this video I did

57
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> harbor these sort of like you</font>

58
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,460
know yeah I'm black but I'm not that

59
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,100
black<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not then you know I</font>

60
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,050
tried to differentiate myself I was kind

61
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,240
of on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new black thing a little bit</font>

62
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,880
and you know it took me a while to break

63
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,890
that and so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watch a video like</font>

64
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,950
this I can empathize past the content of

65
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,720
the video itself to the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

66
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,550
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking in the video because</font>

67
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,640
it's to me I don't know any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but</font>

68
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,700
to me it feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're where I was</font>

69
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,010
six<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago BAM what I can pray for</font>

70
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,960
what I will pray for for them is that in

71
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,450
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> month when they watch the video again</font>

72
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,750
or after this all blows over and you

73
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,150
know people move on to the next thing

74
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's upsetting and rightfully so um</font>

75
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,000
and they go back and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">the video and they or they watch the</font>

77
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,870
video a month from now two months from

78
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">now a year from now a few years from now</font>

79
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,150
I hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they cringe that's the one</font>

80
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,010
thing I hope that happens to them is

81
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,660
that they watch themselves in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this video</font>

82
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,700
and they cringe a little bit because

83
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,890
that'll mean they've grown their battle

84
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,510
they're better people for it and they've

85
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,580
learned from it and they've gained

86
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,270
something you know I look back at my

87
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,150
self online back when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my new</font>

88
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,070
black miss you know I if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back far</font>

89
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,630
enough on my tumblr and stuff like that

90
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,340
you can see it you can see a little bit

91
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,920
of that self-hatred that hint of anti

92
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,260
blackness that hint of just loss of self

93
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,070
you know that I have and but then I look

94
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,670
and I watch myself I can literally see

95
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,980
myself become woke I can literally see

96
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,570
myself begin to find a community that I

97
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,580
belong in and that's partially why I'm

98
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,220
here on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube as well is because</font>

99
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,019
YouTube is what gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling of</font>

100
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,300
actually finding the black community

101
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,080
that I can feel a part of you can slit

102
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,240
early see my transition into Who I am

103
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,030
today and so which is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a work in</font>

104
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,460
progress obviously that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my hope I hope</font>

105
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,319
that they'll watch themselves in the

106
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,169
video and like many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us who have said</font>

107
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,410
dumb crap and many points in our life

108
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,750
cringe a little bit when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they look at</font>

109
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,889
themselves because that'll mean they

110
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:46,940
have learned that'll mean there are

111
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,650
better people now and honestly that's

112
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you become a better person is</font>

113
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,169
you make mistakes blatantly in front of

114
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,440
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learn from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it that is</font>

115
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,900
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you become a better person and I did</font>

116
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,870
that many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times and I still do you know</font>

117
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,270
I mean I'm not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hollies from last</font>
