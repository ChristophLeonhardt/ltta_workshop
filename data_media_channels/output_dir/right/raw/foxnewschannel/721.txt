1
00:00:00,982 --> 00:00:02,182
CREATE PRETEXT TO INVESTIGATE

2
00:00:02,183 --> 00:00:02,449
IT.

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,385
IF TOMORROW'S HEARING WILL DRILL

4
00:00:05,386 --> 00:00:06,686
DOWN ON THAT VERY CENTRAL

5
00:00:06,687 --> 00:00:07,420
QUESTION HERE AND EARLIER THIS

6
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:10,357
EVENING I SPOKE WITH LINDSEY

7
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:11,858
GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA, A

8
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:13,760
MEMBER OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY

9
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:15,962
COMMITTEE.

10
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:20,734
TONIGHT A LETTER THAT YOU WROTE

11
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:23,370
TO ROD ROSENSTEIN WHO IS VERY

12
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,905
CENTRAL TO ALL OF THIS AND IN IT

13
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:26,439
WE ARE GOING TO PUT UP ON THE

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,374
SCREEN THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT

15
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,177
YOU WOULD LIKE HIM TO ANSWER.

16
00:00:34,582 --> 00:00:35,282
SUPERVISING THE INFORMANT OR

17
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:37,184
DIRECTING THE DECISION TO USE

18
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:38,218
THE INFORMANT?

19
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,787
DID STRZOK OR PAGE OF ANY SUCH

20
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:42,189
ROLE TO ANY INFORMANT USE TO

21
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:42,923
INVESTIGATE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

22
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:44,891
OR ASSOCIATES AND NUMBER TWO DID

23
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:46,626
STRZOK OR PAGE HAVE ANY ROLE IN

24
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:47,227
REVIEWING, APPROVING OR

25
00:00:47,228 --> 00:00:50,730
SUPPLYING INFORMATION FOR THE

26
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,598
FISA WARRANT OBTAINED TWO

27
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:52,199
SURVEILLED CARTER PAGE.

28
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,801
HE PUT THOSE TWO THINGS

29
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:55,535
TOGETHER, YOUR LETTER AND THAT

30
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:58,104
REAL CLEAR INVESTIGATIONS PIECE,

31
00:00:58,105 --> 00:00:59,406
EVERYBODY IS PROBING AT HOW THIS

32
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:00,373
WHOLE THING GOT STARTED AND

33
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:01,208
WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS SOME FORM

34
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:03,777
OF ENTRAPMENT.

35
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:04,477
>> WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THE

36
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:07,113
PERSON IN CHARGE OF THE CLINTON

37
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:07,881
EMAIL INVESTIGATION, MR. STRZOK

38
00:01:07,882 --> 00:01:09,983
AND MS. PAGE OR IN THE TANK FOR

39
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:12,953
CLINTON AND HATED TRUMP.

40
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:13,887
DID THOSE TWO PEOPLE START AN

41
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:16,156
INVESTIGATION AGAINST THE TRUMP

42
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:18,358
CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THEY HAD A

43
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:18,959
POLITICAL BIAS?

44
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,361
OR WAS IT BASED ON LEGITIMATE

45
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:21,962
EVIDENCE?

46
00:01:21,963 --> 00:01:23,530
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THIS GUY

47
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:25,365
SUPERVISING A CONFIDENTIAL

48
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:27,934
INFORMANT AGAINST THE TRUMP

49
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:29,736
CAMPAIGN GIVEN HIS BIAS AND

50
00:01:29,737 --> 00:01:30,837
GIVEN HIS DISLIKE FOR

51
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:31,304
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

52
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:32,405
HE SHOULD BE THE LAST GUY TO GO

53
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:35,775
TO COURT TO GET A WARRANT ON

54
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:36,543
ANYBODY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

55
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:37,177
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

56
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:38,812
MY QUESTION IS WHAT ROLE DID

57
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:42,182
>> Martha: IT FOLLOWS UP ON

58
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:44,918
THEIR TEXT MESSAGES, WHICH I

59
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:50,190
FUNNY, I WAS JUST KIDDING

60
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:51,424
AROUND.

61
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:52,392
I DIDN'T LIKE THE PRESIDENT BUT

62
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:54,661
IT HAD NO BEARING WHATSOEVER ON

63
00:01:54,662 --> 00:01:55,362
MY ACTIONS.

64
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:56,963
BUT TALKING ABOUT THE INSURANCE

65
00:01:56,964 --> 00:01:59,966
POLICY, TALK ABOUT STOPPING HIM.

66
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:02,369
AND THEN, LATE SPRING OF 2016,

67
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,504
ALL THESE EFFORTS TO TRY TO POKE

68
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:07,274
FOR SOFT PLACES WITHIN THE

69
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:14,214
>> JULY 31ST THEY CLEAR CLINTON.

70
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:16,283
LET ME TELL YOU THIS, IF YOU HAD

71
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:18,585
DONE WHAT SHE HAD DONE WITH HER

72
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:19,386
EMAIL SYSTEMS AND COMPROMISED

73
00:02:19,387 --> 00:02:20,120
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION YOU WOULD

74
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:22,989
NOT HAVE BEEN CLEARED, SO THEY

75
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,591
COULD NOT STOP TRUMP IF THEY

76
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:26,126
FOUND HER GUILTY OF ABUSING

77
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:27,427
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

78
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:30,764
SO THERE WAS NO WAY IN HELL IF

79
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:33,833
THE GOAL WAS TO FIND CLINTON

80
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:34,768
LIABLE.

81
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,636
THE QUESTION NOW IS ABOUT THE

82
00:02:36,637 --> 00:02:37,370
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

83
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:38,405
IT WAS IT A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

84
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:39,139
INVESTIGATION WHERE THEY WERE

85
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:44,778
IF THAT'S THE REASON THEY

86
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:45,512
INVESTIGATED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,

87
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:46,980
THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD THE TRUMP

88
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:47,747
CAMPAIGN THERE ARE SOME

89
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:51,952
THE FACT THAT THEY NEVER TOLD

90
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:55,388
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE

91
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:56,957
INVESTIGATION IS VERY CURIOUS TO

92
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:57,223
ME.

93
00:02:57,224 --> 00:02:57,757
>> Martha: I AGREE.

94
00:02:57,758 --> 00:02:59,793
THAT WOULD BE A DEFENSIVE

95
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:01,461
BRIEFING AND THERE'S A VERY

96
00:03:01,462 --> 00:03:03,730
CLEAR MENTION OF THE DECISION

97
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,798
NOT TO DO A DEFENSIVE BRIEFING

98
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:05,532
AND HOPEFULLY WE ARE GOING TO

99
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,767
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS WITH

100
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:08,401
SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS.

101
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:11,571
JOHN BRENNAN, NO FAN OF THE

102
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:12,973
PRESIDENT HAS SAID THIS.

103
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:14,641
WHEN THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S WORK

104
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:16,609
IS DONE, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

105
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,777
MUST HAVE ITS MODERN-DAY

106
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:19,212
EQUIVALENT OF WATERGATE HEROES.

107
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:20,613
HOWARD BAKER, ELLIOTT

108
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:24,985
RICHARDSON, JOHN B, WHO WILL PUT

109
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:25,885
COUNTRY, FELLOW CITIZENS AND LAW

110
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:28,688
ABOVE ANY ONE PERSON INCLUDING

111
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:29,122
DONALD TRUMP.

112
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:37,464
RECEIVE COUNSEL AND ADVICE FROM

113
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:38,198
ABOUT ANYTHING RELATED TO TRUMP

114
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,698
WOULD BE BRENNAN.

115
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:39,366
I THINK VERNON HAS SHOWN A

116
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:40,433
DISLIKE FOR THE PRESIDENT THAT

117
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:41,935
QUESTIONS WHETHER OR NOT HE

118
00:03:41,936 --> 00:03:45,805
ACTUALLY WAS FAIR AS THE CIA

119
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:46,406
DIRECTOR.

120
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:47,140
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT THE

121
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:49,576
PEOPLE WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE

122
00:03:49,577 --> 00:03:50,577
HATED TRUMP AND I THINK THEY

123
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:52,979
WERE ALL IN THE TANK FOR CLINTON

124
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,381
AND WE WILL SEE WHAT MR. MUELLER

125
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:56,249
SAYS, BUT I DO KNOW THIS.

126
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:01,955
CONNECTION EARLY ON WAS

127
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:03,289
MR. STRZOK, WHO WAS CLEARLY IN

128
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,225
THE TANK FOR CLINTON AND HATED

129
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:05,558
TRUMP.

130
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,960
I UNDERSTAND WHY MUELLER FIRED

131
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:07,227
HIM.

132
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:10,163
I UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD FIRE

133
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:11,431
OTHER PEOPLE GIVEN THEIR

134
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:12,799
BEHAVIOR REGARDING THE TRUMP

135
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,433
CAMPAIGN.

136
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:15,568
SO WE WILL SEE WHAT MR. MUELLER

137
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:17,570
DOES BUT I'M SHOCKED THAT NOBODY

138
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:19,305
IN YOUR BUSINESS REALLY OUTSIDE

139
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:23,410
OF FOX NEWS SEEMS TO GIVE A DAMN

140
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:24,711
THAT THE HEAD INVESTIGATOR FOR

141
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:27,447
THE FBI WANTED TO STOP TRUMP AND

142
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:29,482
BASICALLY FASTER DICED AN

143
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:35,588
>> Martha: IF THERE WAS ANY

144
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:36,523
ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE THE

145
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:37,791
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ON THE

146
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,993
PART OF THESE INDIVIDUALS, EVERY

147
00:04:39,994 --> 00:00:00,000
AMERICAN SHOULD BE VERY, VERY
