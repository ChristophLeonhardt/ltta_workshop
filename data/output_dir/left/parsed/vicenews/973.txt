hi this is Ron mail and I'm Russell mail
and we're the band sparks
we really try to at least in our own
minds pretend like we're making our
first album and that the people that'll
be hearing the album might be hearing us
for the for the very first time a song
like this was actually written around a
keyboard
both the verse and the chorus are using
the same piano chord progression
edith piaf was a French singer but she
was also tragic and sad she had grown up
on the streets of Paris
run oh my god I told ya
you should only grant early on pretty
some but not intended
edith piaf in fact is saying that all
this debauchery all these things I've
done throughout my whole life
I regret none of it I'm completely happy
this guy in the arson is saying I wish I
was able to regret nothing in the way
that Edith Piaf did you want in a song
like this where it's pretty even as far
as what it's doing chord wise you don't
want the drums to be distracting from
that we added those sort of electronic
claps claps that enter in the second
verse and they kind of set that verse
off from from the others
there was the big debate between the two
of us of the validity of even having a
guitar line in the song whether that
ruins some of the purity of this of the
song despite having 22 or 23 albums I
always feel that the next time is I'm
gonna run dry so when you start a song
and you're actually able to make
something out of nothing it always seems
like a miracle
you
