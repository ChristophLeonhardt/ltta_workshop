so overall Hauser race against my Sango it's going really well you know there are three specific prongs that we are using for our campaign and our data is coming in showing that it's working we've got fundraising so the FEC reports are in we have social media Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube and then we also have the field which is knocking on doors making phone calls and so forth and I mean honestly we're killing it in all three areas so in social media alone we are six times our engagement has increased 6% six times over all of the other candidates there who are who are hovering at 1% and lower Dianne Feinstein at 0% so there's two things they in this matters that you mentioned in previous interviews that I always find both amusing and really telling hey Allison has over 1,700 volunteers you probably get to that in a sec but I won't now trust me he does that to me all the time Allison Hartson comm / now in order to be we're trying to get trying to get to 2,000 volunteers okay so we got to get there that makes a huge difference feinstein does not even have a portion on our website where you could volunteer she's like I'm not interested in you actually it's up now it is oh my god you've breaking her everywhere yeah I actually just saw an article on McClatchy kitty I'll do that ah okay no seriously Allison when you when when you first started she didn't have one on our website right you should change it I have no idea but it's up now we went and looked and hilarious unfortunately nobody knows if it works because nobody's clicked on it yet Trump oh yeah hey no more tax cuts for the rich yeah that's probably a bridge too far okay so but this the the second mega I'm amused by is on social media she doesn't try at all she's why would I try to reach real people like what are you gonna send it to your family and friends what are you gonna give me a donation under $200 so how much I don't know if you know this how much does she give herself five million dollars well she that's why she doesn't need you to volunteer she doesn't need your donation that's why she doesn't do social media because she gave herself five million dollars now she'll only have 18 million left plus she also gets the corporate donors plus her husband's a billionaire yeah okay so but but the rest of the field you're laughing oh yeah absolutely so alright so we have that with social media which I just want to say you know we know that Bernie ended up getting more of the youth vote than Trump and Hillary combined and this was largely because of social media and what they were doing in the field for grassroots we have taken that same exact model thanks to justice Democrats thanks to Bernie Sanders and what he showed is possible and we're doing it for my campaign as well and so that's six that's six times over all the other candidates is huge in in the field alone we are showing that after 30 seconds of talking about me my campaign my messaging we are at I'm at 60 percent above Diane Feinstein in terms of support so let me break that thing is again I heard that one off air so to be fair Alice's volunteers with 1,700 people they call people so we're not look we're always honest about that stuff it's not like they're it's a random and scientific poll okay but they call people and they tell Alice's positions now Feinstein it's really popular people are gonna hear and your positions are unpopular they're real people they have no skin in the game right you're gonna say oh sorry Allison no or sorry to the volunteer I don't support Allison Feinstein has been doing a great job I support her hey after 30 seconds of talking to Allison's volunteers 60 percent go okay Allison and this is actually a really important point because yes this is our data from us talking to people but it actually shows why our volunteers are so important you are critical and which camera am I looking at just keep doing that but no like seriously this is why you as a volunteer are absolutely critical to us winning on June 5th getting into the general and being able to go toe-to-toe with the establishment that is Dianne Feinstein because it is only through you going to those doors it is only through you picking up those phones and making those dials that people actually learn the truth about her and the truth about our movement so there have been so many instances reported back from our volunteers in the field where they're talking to somebody who does support Dianne Feinstein and they have no idea that she doesn't support Medicare for all and then they say and then they tell them that and they're like oh my gosh give me more information about Allison Hartson this is really for the volunteers for everybody who is so ready for change and to be part of it this is such a perfect opportunity to get out there and inform people I mean it's one thing and it is an important thing for us to go out there and tweet and share on Facebook and so forth and have conversations with our friends but we have one month left we have the resources we're providing it for free go out there and educate people right and so if you're volunteering s and hearts and that comes lash now and the link will be down below if you're watching this later on YouTube or Facebook and Allison are so calm so I should go to donate small donations allow you to have the staff to coordinate the volunteers etc but there's one other aspect of it that I think is interesting is if you're them if you're a volunteer you're making a big difference but if you're the media if and I'm the media now in this case I'm on your side so it's not quite it's not quite fair right but if I was someone removed from this race and I look down and I go well that couldn't come it's in trouble because whether it's you or anyone else the minute you tell people in California with Dianne Feinstein's actual positions are and 30 seconds or less her support is gone yeah gone evaporating it from San Diego all the way for the entire state through Northern California 1700 volunteers knocking on doors and dialing every single day we need more we need a lot more and so by the way both in volunteers and donations you could actually do it from anywhere in the country you don't have to live in California because not here on doors if you're a California citizen it is wonderful please please please sign up for that because that makes all the difference but making calls still gigantic these what alice is referring to is all phone calls and you can do that from anywhere in the country okay so make sure that you're participating in those ways and by the way if you want to make sure that you support Alison go to our website she has won five sine figured out that you're supposed to have a website later but anyways so and go to Alison arson common look around do you agree with the policy positions do you do you like what she's saying and then if you like it then get into a fight get in the fight I'm telling you if you had the same name recognition it's fine sign first of all that's not even a contest if people in California knew your positions and her position is not a contest yeah I would blow out of the water I'm serious I you would landslide her I know that the rest of the and then there's another one person in the race is also politician I really like him he's a politician hey Alison ran a non-profit for five years and it was to get money out of politics you know with the number one issue in California is getting money out of politics so I mean you can't find a candidate better suited for this state but unfortunately you don't have the name recognition that's why you need those volunteers calling people etc we're getting it you know another thing we're that's starting to happen at the doors our volunteers are getting excited they're starting to talk to people who are like oh I think I've heard of Alison Hertz in oh yeah I know Alison Hertz and somebody talked to a waitress at a restaurant that knows it's happening you know what I heard that Feinstein just picked up the phone and say I know Alison Hart said whatever you do I'm gonna match right you're wrong your people know I can play that game too seriously game you know siddhart the name you know so if you keep on pushing her I don't know how far left she's gonna go and so that's a win in and of itself so every dollar spent on your champagne is a dollar at a bare minimum pushing Feinstein further and further left no but the real thing is to beat her because why why do you want a politician in office who you have to push question 50 years later gets to position at 10 percent progressive well Jake also I'm pushing everybody left everybody who's claiming to be progressive everybody now is running at the top of their site money in politics get big money out of politics overturn citizens united everybody's trying to do it because they know that my record of fighting this around the country for the last five years running a non-profit as a national director is really really difficult if not impossible to contend with when people hear my message when people actually understand that and I'm I'm telling you I've been on panels with these people they have tried to poopoo what we have done because that's what you do right trying to just dismiss your opponent and when they realize that that's not a winning strategy because people actually really care about ending corruption now all of a sudden they're all moving more left and starting to take that on yeah but Allison when you join a wolf Packer when it was a tiny little organization pushing for an amendment to get money out of politics that no one believed in weren't you a johnny-come-lately and I'm sure you joined it for all the money right I don't know if you could answer this question but let's say as a matter of percentages rather than raw dollars how much of a pay cut did you take to join Wolf Pack and by the way it's not like she was a banker she was a teacher yeah it was a 50% pay cut so yeah I I actually I actually gave up my apartment and put all of my stuff in storage to move back home with my parents and live practically full-time on an airplane and in motels to travel the country working to get this done
