good evening everybody I'm Sheila Gunn read and welcome to the gun show now as conservatives we like to pride ourselves on being the ideology of free and liberal exchange of ideas we like to say that we think good ideas stand up to scrutiny and debate and that we certainly don't shy away from a good civilized debate we say we don't believe in censorship even for people we disagree with now I like to think that's true for the majority of the conservative movement but what happens when our conservative thought leaders don't support free speech and accountability when we call upon them to do so what happens then now tonight I'm bringing you a wild story of political censorship a whisper campaign and accusations that a conservative think tank isn't passing the litmus test when defending our fundamental freedoms tonight I'm bringing you the crazy story of Jim Cara Helios Cara Helios is an Ontario conservative activist he's the founder of two grassroots conservative movements one is called ax attacks which of course is an anti carbon tax movement and the second movement is called take back our PC party targeted at making the Ontario PC party accountable to its own grassroots membership now both of these movements should be something grassroots conservative activists consider mainstream ideas right low taxes accountability from our own leadership seems like pretty reasonable stuff but Cara Helio says that because of his activism to hold Ontario PC leader Patrick Brown accountable both of his organizations have been banned from having booths at this year's upcoming Manning Center networking conference Cara Helios spoke to me earlier this week to tell me his side of this wild story hey Jim thanks for joining me I I'm Western base so a lot of people might not know exactly who you are why don't you give us a brief little bio of who Jim Kerr Helios is and how long you've been with a PC party in Ontario thanks Sheila so I'm happy to be on the show I've been actually involved in Ontario politics conservative politics both federally and provincially provincially with the Ontario PC Party for about 15 years and last year or in the beginning of the year in February I actually started a national campaign called axe the carbon tax obviously it's what the name says it's opposed to carbon pricing of any kind and it's really a national campaign talking about all the political players on carbon taxation and halfway through the year in the summer of 2017 I got involved with a Ontario specific campaign called take back our PC party which is really geared towards the Ontario PC Party and some troubles were having there in Ontario so you mentioned briefly your take back the PC party why don't you explain a little bit about that because some of the criticism is that it is divisive it's going to cause a fracture and the PC party is that your intent with your moment with the movement that you're trying to start well actually I originally started axed the carbon tax before take back our PC party and it started in Manitoba and if anyone in Canada wants to find out who's been giving political cover to Justin Trudeau to mandate a carbon tax right across Canada you don't have to look any further than Ontario PC leader Patrick Brown when Patrick Brown was running for the PC Party leadership in Ontario he was against the carbon tax and he even said and I quote never again are we going to see a policy imposed on the grassroots of the party from Toronto without the grassroots having input and and as soon as he became leader the first chance see God he advocated for a carbon tax and he really did give Trudeau cover to mandate a carbon tax across Canada we all know Trudeau's majority runs through Ontario and what brown did is he rolled out the red carpet for Trudeau Brown announced his carbon tax policy months before Trudeau said he was going to mandate it so it wasn't surprising that a few months later Trudeau looked at the landscape looked at no provincial party leader in Ontario was going to oppose him on a carbon tax and he decided to make a carbon tax mandatory but like you said the trouble with Patrick Brown didn't stop at his carbon tax and his war on the grassroots with policy then he went after something as basic and as simple as nominations everyone in Canada who gets involved in the political party knows that when you go to vote at a nomination meeting it matters it means something if you're selecting and you're voting the candidate that's going to represent your party and your riding come election time well in Patrick Brown's PC party party constitutions don't matter you just misrepresented Ontario election law and him and party president Rick Dijkstra decided that if they want to overrule or ignore the votes at a nomination meeting or if there are allegations of ballot box stuffing or voter fraud or vote rigging at a nomination they can just ignore it all because Patrick Brown just made up this power that he has this quote-unquote legal authority to appoint candidates whenever he so pleases and ignore nomination meetings altogether and so that's where the genesis of tape back to our PC party unfortunately is really calling conservatives to stay within the PC party not to leave explaining to them that under the Constitution of the PC party we can fix things from the grassroots up and and not to divide in fraction fracture the conservative movement in Ontario and make sure the PC Party of Ontario which is the oldest political party in Canada not just in Ontario stays together for the foreseeable and the long-term future you know it's funny that you mentioned the nomination process as a conservative movement that I'm a part of that you're a part of nationally we were lighting our hair on fire when Justin Trudeau declared that he would have open nominations for the Liberal Party of Canada and then lied rescinded that promise and was nominating whoever he felt like in the local riding and we were rightly outraged by that and I think you raise an important point that that that purity test that litmus test for ethical behavior doesn't just apply to our enemies it also has to apply to our own our own leaders we have to be better than the Liberals and as an Albertan someone who is loudly against the carbon tax and our conservative leadership here whether it was the PCs or the Wildrose and now is the United Conservative Party we are against the carbon tax we were fighting against the federal government against this carbon tax Brad wall and on terror or in Saskatchewan same think so it seems like a real betrayal of a nationwide conservative movement to have a PC leader in Ontario a province we need to win who is endorsing a carbon tax and giving permission to the Liberals to impose it in Canada's largest province yeah it really is a tragedy on multiple scales on the carbon tax like we talked about you really did roll out the red carpet for Trudeau to find no opposition in Ontario when he switched his position from cooperating with the provinces to mandating it so you know Trudeau's majority depends on Ontario and when he looks in Ontario and there's no party leader that's going to oppose him it really makes it easy for him to say I'm gonna try to make a carbon tax mandatory and on the nomination stuff it's even it's even it's more it's more tragic it's more concerning than just a politician changing his mind and it's it's it's fundamental in terms of a party Constitution you know in in Ontario we've had PC nominations several if not over a dozen where reports of ballot box stuffing and vote rigging and voter fraud have come forward one candidate sued the PC party and not still in the courts the Hamilton police are now conducting criminal probe in one nomination and there's been many other nominations where reports of this type of activity have occurred and instead of doing the easy thing instead of reviewing those nominations possibly redoing them Patrick Brown decided to make up this big colossal lie this big lie that the Ontario election Act gives him the power the quote-unquote legal power the legal authority to pick and appoint the candidates that he wants and then he said he was going to appoint half the candidates of the party for the next election and he was going to do all that under the guise of Ontario's election act and he was going to ignore these allegations of ballot box stuffing and voter fraud like I I can't believe it I don't think you could believe it either as I'm saying it and it's worse than that ever since he's made his decision on the carbon tax and taking this position that nomination meetings don't matter and he's playing fast and loose with Ontario election act his his poll numbers have plummeted for two years now he's he's been declining in his poll numbers he's now in a statistical dead heat with Kathleen Wynne like can you believe that a PC Party leader in Ontario is in a dead heat statistical tie in the polling numbers with Kathleen Wynne because I can't believe it that is a complete and utter failure that's a failure of leadership it's a inability of the party itself I guess because the fish rots from the head down to capitalize on these huge immense failures in Ontario Ontario is the most indebted sub sovereign government on the planet it wouldn't take a lot of work for a good conservative party to to mobilize that into a real movement to toss the Liberals out and it's just not happening in Ontario yeah and I can tell you conservatives are not happy either on the carbon tax issue or on this fundamental question of nomination meetings and democracy and an opposing obviously voter fraud or ballot box stuffing it's so bad that conservatives are leaving the PC party in Ontario and and that's what take back our PC party is trying to do we've been working for months to call a general to follow a process in the PC party Constitution we've had thousands of former members and current members of the PC party sign up there signing the petition were really close to to getting there to getting to the general meeting in November I actually sent out a letter from axe the carbon tax and take back our PC party to some PC Party supporters I exposed Patrick Browns lies with regards to the carbon tax with regards to how he's playing fast and loose and ignoring the party Constitution on how we select candidates and I told the truth and I informed these members former and current members that they had the power to fix things under the party Constitution Constitution and they just needed to stay in the party and then Patrick Brown lost it he lost his mind he went crazy or something I don't know next thing I know the PC Party executive starts a lawsuit against me it's the first time in Canada that I know of in my research that a political party has sued an individual let alone one of its own party members then they revoke my membership then they barred me from entering their convention in November then they started a whisper campaign attacking my character to some media and the candidates in the caucus luckily on December 22nd on Ontario Court judge thrill at the PC party's lawsuit and he said quote it lacks substantive merit and he said it was a strategic attempt by the PC Party executive to limit my freedom of speech so here I'm running two campaigns debating political issues and the Ontario piece is for the executive and Patrick Brown collude and resort to heavy-handed tactics to try to shut down this grassroots movement now I think that brings us to the next issue you mentioned the grassroots movement can your Canada's premier grassroots political activist Committee as far as the conservative movement goes is the Manning Center conference and that happens every single year it's supposed to invite conservative activists and conservative movers and shakers from all across the country to talk about conservative issues how to mobilize and energize the movement and the causes that we all embrace and you wanted to participate in the Manning Center conference this year as someone who is driving these grassroots initiatives against the carbon tax and to make the PC party in Ontario better and more accountable what do you tell us what happened with that yeah so actually I went to the mana conference last year and it wasn't bad they had a they had a pretty good cross-section of speakers they had a little debate on the carbon tax the rebels own Raheel reso spoke Tom quick in Mark Steyn was was the HOH so it wasn't a bad event and over the last year I had ax the carbon tax booth at the rebels own event and I had a booth at the Conservative Party of Canada's leadership vote and there I met mark Cameron for well actually I'd met him before but we spoke there and he's obviously an advocate in favor of carbon taxation and he's speaking at the Mannion conference and Mark offered to have a debate with me sometime in the future so I thought you know what why not call the Manning centre and see if I can get a booth at their manning conference in February and offer up that I'd be happy to debate or be part of a panel on carbon taxation because they've got Dave McLaughlin speaking who's an advocate of carbon taxation they've got Mark Cameron there surely I thought they need someone on the other side of the debate who can who can usher in some some debate on whether carbon taxation is the way to go or not and who better than someone leading a national campaign against the carbon tax so originally I said I'd like to have a booth it seemed like in the correspondence all as well they said the premium booth would cost twenty-five hundred bucks and I said great I'm in and then I said you know what I've heard that you guys are looking for boots I heard they were begging a couple other advocacy groups to buy a blue suit I said I'll take two boots I'll take a booth for take back our PC Party as well and then dead silence for two weeks I couldn't get a confirmation if I was going to get one or two booths I couldn't get a response on whether they were considering letting me speak on one of their panels on carbon taxation to balance out the debate and after two weeks I think I called I emailed several times and I finally got a response not only are they not interested in having me speak they're not giving me any boots not one not two boots not four take back our PC party and not perhaps the carbon tax either and what reason did they give you no I full disclosure I've seen the emails the back and forth was pretty polite they seemed sort of eager to have you spend your hard-earned money to participate in their conference and then they pulled the rug out from under you what was the excuse that they gave you yeah so I wasn't you know I was pulling back and forth I thought maybe if they were going to be have limited spots for booth they tell me I can only have one booth but you're going to love this they email me and they say we are always delighted to encourage and entertain wide-ranging discussions so long as they are constructive however we do not accept booths which are essentially focused on interpersonal attacks and division thanks for understanding like these guys Joker's or what hypocrites really the man in the center decided to make an enemy of two campaigns standing up for grassroots democracy in Ontario I couldn't believe it well and it it's fascinating because you're actually trying to do something different than what happened in Alberta with our conservative movement and something different than what happened federally with the conservative movement you actually don't want to fracture the party to purify it by fire so to speak the way it happened at the federal level when the Reform Party broke away from the Progressive Conservatives it was ten years in the wilderness before we were able to put that back together and make some change in Alberta likewise you know we the Wildrose fractured away from the Progressive Conservative Party now they've just United ten good years later you're actually trying to do the complete opposite of that you're trying to avoid that fracture and fix it before it happens and I think there is such a great irony in a conference at a Center headed by preston manning the man who led that fracture that division in the conservative movement so long ago banning you from attending or not attending the conference but having a booth at the conference because you might be a little too divisive well look by these standards if they were gonna play these standards and Manning Center was around when the Reform Party was created by pressing Manning the Reform Party wouldn't be allowed the Manning Centers conference and the Wildrose party wouldn't be allowed either but look we all know that Preston Manning and the new head of the Manning Center Rick Anderson they've been pushing you know this mad carbon tax scheme for years they've been siding with the elites oh and and over anti-democratic ideas and pushing anti-democratic ideas siding with the elites instead over the grassroots is what I wanted to say you know in many ways the press and Manning of the days of the Reform parties like an ancient myth an urban legend yeah where you know if you weren't around to see it you're not quite sure if it was true or not because that prescient Manning is long long gone and then you combine that with Patrick Brown being at the conference he's such a weak leader he's meek he can't take criticism he's thin-skinned he's intolerant of other ideas especially conservative or democratic ideas I mean I did an analysis of the election act in Ontario in the PC Party Constitution and a recent court decision and I said look you don't I wrote an op-ed I said you don't have the power and legal power to appoint candidates and instead of just debating with me on the analysis or saying that I was wrong the PC Party executive tried to silence me shut me down because they know they're wrong so they threw the courts at me and that didn't work they sued me that didn't work the court threw their lawsuit right out the door so you combine those two things the Manning Center with Patrick Brown and Patrick Brown making making his case that he's ready to blow up the PC Party just to be accepted by the liberal elite in the mainstream media as long as they don't criticize him and they're not hard on him he's he's deliberately sabotaging the PC party and corrupting democracy and conservatism in Ontario just so he can get his way and you know what's really odd is I spoke to Stephen Harper in a Calgary reported earlier this year and he said keep up the good work on fighting the carbon tax because there's sinister forces that are working their way in pushing carbon taxation in Canada and it's happening within conservative circles and I didn't really understand what he was saying when something like this happens I'm starting to get the point and I guess this year the Manning Center decided to do Browns bidding to protect Patrick Brown to protect the idea of a Justin Trudeau carbon tax they don't they clearly don't want anyone there having a booth that is exposing Browns sinister behavior and it is hypocrisy at its finest I think well in it it's fascinating to see how little the Manning Center me on the outside of the Manning center looking in how little they're actually learning from the two most successful conservative uprisings in the last year and a half on the continent well I mean we cannot overlook the success of Donald Trump being an outsider campaigning against regulation against carbon taxes and he won handedly again in Alberta Jaison Kenny's has campaigned the centerpiece of his campaign is that his first bill will be the removal of the Alberta carbon tax and the Alberta carbon tax somewhere hovers around 70% unfavorability any day of the week it's probably going to go up do more unfavorable just because it just recently got hiked I mean the most successful juggernauts of the conservative movement right now are those that oppose the carbon tax and the Manning Center it seems like it's so far away from its grassroots mandate that it is it's just an establishment get-together right now yeah and the manege Center says one of their principles is to strengthen grassroots democracy and democratic institutions it's not just in Alberta that people are against the carbon tax multiple polls have shown from Angus tree to form to Main Street that in the high 50s low 60s is the office is the opposition to carbon tax across Canada including in Ontario and it's bigger a larger number amongst conservatives even in Ontario look no one's blaming Preston Manning for what he did in the 90s he called up the federal DC government in Ottawa it was corrupt it was not being conservative it was ignoring the grassroots the Westmont in it that was a divisive debate but Preston Manning was being constructive in his divisiveness when you're debating sinister forces that's a this is the bait to have a proper debate on the lies behind carbon taxation to debate Patrick Brown's corruption of democracy in the party Constitution to expose Patrick Browns lies that he somehow has some legal authority which he doesn't to appoint candidates and ignore nomination meetings and ignore ballot box stuff in defending democracy and defending the taxpayer is a divisive debate but it's constructive to do so and the Manning Center pretending it has this principle of strengthening grassroots democracy and democratic institutions and then telling me there's no role for me to play at their convention either as a speaker or having a booth for either one of my campaigns whether it's the carbon tax acts the carbon tax we take back our PC party it makes their principles their founding principles of facade because they're selling out on their principle in order to Penna to peddle and prop up Patrick Brown's sinister and destructive lies on both the carbon tax and on how he runs his party and governance and local democracy within a party in its nominations you know so fascinating I pride myself on being a conservative because I'd like to think that true conservatives principled conservatives don't demand extreme and unquestionable allegiance to a leader our allegiance should be to our ideas and our principles and it seems like maddening Center is demanding the opposite of you you questioned Patrick Brown and so now you are persona non grata at the Manning Center as conservatives I think our ideas are better and because I know our ideas are better I think they always stand up to rigorous debate that's what's great about conservatives we can have this free and liberal exchange of ideas and and test the merits of our ideas and debate and at the Manning Center the Canada's premier grassroots organization for conservatives they don't believe that anymore at least that's the perception I'm getting from what they're doing to you well you know it's not quick clear what they're doing except you know trying to make sure that Patrick Brown doesn't have any opposition or no one's calling him out on on corrupting the PC party Constitution and ignoring nominations and imposing a carbon tax on conservatives and really not being an opposition leader when it comes to carbon taxation in Ontario so I'm not really sure why the Manning Center has decided to take their conference in this direction I can tell you they've accused them that email they've accused my campaigns of of being having personal attacks well I can tell you I'm having a political debate and running two campaigns and the other side Patrick brown and the PC Party executive have done the following things they've sued me and they failed I won I beat them in court a judge said that their lawsuit hadn't did not have substantive merit and it was designed to limit my freedom of speech limit my ability to participate on a matter of public interest they revoke my membership they banned me from their own PC Party convention then they went and they had a whisper campaign to media candidates and caucus to attack my character so I'm asking the question who's who's conducting the personal attack here I'm trying to have a political debate on the carbon tax and the importance of nominations and voting and the other side's taking this heavy-handed approach trying to shut me down instead of just saying that I'm wrong in my interpretation and the manege Center is siding with it and and I can't understand what's going on here because you're right it's against their founding principle but if the Manning Center and Patrick Brown wants to undermine the legacies of Stephen Harper and Brad wall and they want to undermine the campaign's of Andrew Sheeran Jason Kenney on the carbon tax they can do that they can shut me out of their of their having a booth at their a conference and they can shut me out of speaking on one of their stages but I can tell you if I attend which I plan on attending the Manning Center conference and I go and I talk to people about Patrick Browns fraud and corruption of grassroots democracy and trying to sue me to silence me I think a lot of their attendees are gonna want to hear what I have to say you know what's so funny as conservatives again we like to pat ourselves on the back being the defenders of free speech and the defenders of uncomfortable ideas even offensive ideas that we you know want people to have the opportunity to share their even offensive ideas in the public square because sometimes sunlight is the best disinfectant and the Manning Center and the PC Party of Ontario just don't have the the guts the intestinal fortitude to protect that one basic fundamental right that a judge said the PC Party of Ontario was violating yeah I agree and it's unfortunate that we can't have a debate because like you said conservatism means freedom of expression freedom of speech bring forward your best idea let's debate it out you know instead of running away and hiding and ignoring these debates let's have these debates but it's quite clear there's certain elites in Ontario and the Manning Center I guess is going to take this approach this year at their conference which is doesn't matter if you lie it doesn't matter if you misrepresent Ontario election laws it doesn't matter if you pretend that you're going to bring in a carbon tax that's going to do certain things when it's not it doesn't matter if you want to hide the fact - from Ontario voters that you're going to actually raise taxes by three billion dollars with a direct carbon tax which is what Patrick Brown is planning to do over the current cap-and-trade system we have in place it doesn't matter because if I'm gonna call him out on his lies and I'm gonna challenge him and say you're not reading Ontario election laws properly you're ignoring the PC party Constitution and conservatives and Ontario voters don't want your carbon tax they want you to have a backbone and fight Justin Trudeau not look at him like a celebrity and welcome his ideas in here without any challenge and give up provincial jurisdiction instead of having a debate on these issues they're telling me that I'm being divisive and I'm not being constructive and we're just gonna supposed to roll over and accept this corruption of local democracy and a PC Party Constitution and accept the carbon tax without a fight I think it's ridiculous so Jim what's next for you then you appealing are you going as Manning Center conference participant I guess you said that you are are you going to have a truck try to have a booth next year what's your next step so lucky I'm not begging anyone to give me a booth at a conference like I said the PC Party executive in Ontario is already sued me and they lost I'd beat them in court they've revoke my membership they denied me entry into their convention they've tried to do a whisper campaign about my character to the media and candidates so my heart's not breaking because the Manning Center told me no to a booth I'm not gonna beg to have a booth if they don't want me to have a booth that's up to them but you know what I'm not gonna run and hide I'm not gonna run away from these debates because of these heavy-handed tactics and collusion amongst the elites in the Ontario PC Party the Friends of Patrick brown and those running the Manning Center right now I'm not gonna run and hide I think I'm gonna go to the conference I registered to attend and I think I'm gonna go and I'm gonna if they don't want me speaking on the stage maybe I'll just talk off stage to those that I meet and I'll explain to them what's going on in Ontario both Ruth regards to Patrick Brown not willing to take up the fight and fight Justin Trudeau on the carbon tax and what he's doing he's undermining and you're cheering he's undermining Jason Kennedy and he's making federal Ontario MPs there he's putting them in a tough situation where 2018 they're gonna be asked by Patrick Brown to campaign and advocate for his Justin Trudeau style carbon tax that's going to bring in 3 billion dollars more of government revenue than the current cap-and-trade system and then those same federal Ontario B's in a year are going to be going out to those same doors they knocked on to advocate for Andrew Shearer who's saying he's going to get rid of a carbon tax and and on top of that I think that there's a lot of attendees at the madding center that are gonna want to hear about the heavy-handed tactics that the Ontario PC Party executive have put on me in order to silence me in my correct analysis about the party leader Patrick Brown not having the power the legal power to appoint candidates about ignoring corruption ballot box stuffing vote rigging voter fraud at local nominations and throwing the PC the constitution of the window I think a lot of attendees at the Manning Center conference are going to want to have to hear my story and about the heavy-handed tactics to shut me down so I think I should attend well I think you should too I am going to just to be fair in balance to reach out to the Manning Center and give them an opportunity to explain themselves but from what I've seen and what you've explained to me it sure looks like they've been co-opted by like you say sinister forces who are both protecting the Liberals in the PC party and pushing a carbon tax yeah it certainly looks like that you know we can only hope it was a misunderstanding maybe they'll change their mind but from where I'm standing you know telling me that I can't get one or two boots at their conference because I'm defending a grassroots democratic process or leading one and and fighting against the carbon tax doesn't look like a sound reason to deny me from where I sit not at all thanks for talking with me today Jim and fight on thanks Sheila talk soon now it's my job here at the rebel to tell the other side of the story I saw the email exchange between Kara Helios in the Manning Center it was polite and cordial until they accused him of being divisive and making personal attacks just out of the blue I didn't see any divisiveness in the emails to the Manning Center so they must be referring to Kara Haley OSes activism against PC leader Patrick Brown now I wanted to know if there was more to this story so I reached out to the Manning Center for their side I asked them what the basis was for accusing Kara Helios of division and personal attacks I asked them what if any influence did Patrick Brown and the Ontario pcs have on the decision to exclude Kara helios from having his booths I asked the Manning Center how a Center founded by Preston Manning of the Reform Party reconciles a position of zero division allowed given that the reform movement was fractured off the PC Party of Canada I asked why the Wildrose party in the past has received a prominent position at Manning center conferences if again division amongst the conservative movement isn't allowed at all anymore I asked how the Manning Center reconciles their guiding principles of accountability decentralization and grassroots activism with their decision to block Kara Helios the Manning Center hasn't gotten back to me yet but I promise you if they do I will let you know and I will update my story I want to hear what the Manning Center has to say I don't want to believe that Canada's for most conservative grassroots activism networking conference is blocking grassroots activists because they aren't exactly toeing the party line I don't want to find out that the Manning Center of 2018 wouldn't allow Preston Manning of 1994 to come to their new conference if our leaders and think tanks don't respect fundamental conservative principles it's time for us to get new leaders and some brand new think tanks we can't expect our conservative leaders to hold the liberals to account if those same conservative leaders refuse to be accountable to us thanks for joining me for this week's gun show I'll see everybody back here at the very same time at the very same place next week and remember don't let the government tell you that you've had too much to think you
