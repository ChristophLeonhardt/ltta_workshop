1
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,219
The house is kind of asking you
all the time to

2
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:37,128
act slightly differently than
you normally would.

3
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:39,627
And you notice that you're
acting differently.

4
00:00:39,627 --> 00:00:42,389
So then you interact with the
fact that you notice it.

5
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:45,630
I can feel the space working
on my feet.

6
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,599
So you know, it's kind of that your feet are
grabbing the floor all the time.

7
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,430
It is a geometric space, but it's
an inconsistent geometric space.

8
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,080
And that's my favorite feature
because it's constantly not

9
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,060
where you think it is.

10
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,889
It's weird that you are in a room
that you don't know where the room is.

11
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,370
I find myself using
the building to navigate myself.

12
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,050
Which usually you don't push
on the walls in your house when

13
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,920
you're walking in your house 
but in this house you do.

14
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,860
You push the walls, you pull the
pillars.

15
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,149
You know everything and
especially in the bathroom,

16
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:52,290
where you have to walk around
the tubular shower in a tubular space,

17
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,660
I'm always kind of, putting
your shoulder into the side of

18
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,780
the space to negotiate it.

19
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,579
Yes, that's kind of nice.
You know, you are kind of hugging,

20
00:02:03,579 --> 00:00:00,000
hugging the space.
You don't hug a house usually.
