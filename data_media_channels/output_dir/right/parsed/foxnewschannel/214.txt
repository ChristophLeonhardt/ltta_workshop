JESSE: THE LIBERAL MEDIA MELTING
DOWN OVER KANYE'S MEETING WITH
THE PRESIDENT ON THURSDAY.
HERE IS SOME OF WHAT KANYE HAD
TO SAY.
>> WHEN I PUT THE HAT ON IT MADE
ME FEEL LIKE SUPERMAN.
THE LIBERALS ARE TRYING TO
CONTROL BLACK PEOPLE BECAUSE
THEY KNOW WE ARE EMOTIONAL
PEOPLE.
ILLEGAL GUNS ARE THE PROBLEM.
NOT LEGAL GUNS.
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
HE WANTS TO BRING JOBS INTO
AMERICA.
OUR BEST EXPORT IS ENTERTAINMENT
AND IDEAS.
BUT WHEN WE MAKE EVERYTHING IN
CHINA AND NOT AMERICA, WE ARE
CHEATING ON OUR COUNTRY.
JESSE: THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAS
BEEN HITTING ON KANYE EVER SINCE
HE CAME OUT AS A TRUMP
SUPPORTER.
>> KANYE IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
NEGROES DON'T READ.
WE HAVE THIS NOW AND DONALD
TRUMP WILL USE IT AND PERVERT IT
AND HE'LL HAVE SOMEBODY TO TAKE
PICTURES WITH.
HE'S AN ATTENTION WHORE LIKE THE
PRESIDENT.
HE'S THE TOKEN NEGRO OF THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
NOBODY SHOULD BE TAKING KANYE
WEST SERIOUSLY.
JESSE: WOW, HERE REACT, ROB,
DOES IT OFFEND YOU?
>> LOOKING AT THAT CLIP, I WOULD
SAY DON LEMON WENT FROM AN
ANCHOR AT CNN TO THE CHIEF
OVERSEER ON THE CLINTON
FOUNDATION.
IT'S DISGUSTING TO ME.
WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS
SEND A MESSAGE TO ANY OTHER
BLACK AMERICAN OR BLACK
CONSERVATIVE THAT SUPPORTS THE
PRESIDENT, THIS IS WHAT WE'LL DO
TO YOU IF YOU ARE VOCAL ABOUT
THAT SUPPORT.
JESSE: WENDY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?
>> MY PROBLEM IS THAT HE WAS
GIVEN THE ABILITY TO GO TO THE
OVAL OFFICE AND HE BASICALLY
PERFORMED IN IGNORANCE.
WHEN HE WENT THERE HE COULD HAVE
TALKED TO DONALD TRUMP ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHICAGO, HE
COULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT STOP AND
FRISK AND HE COULD HAVE ASKED
DONALD TRUMP WHY HE CUT
HEALTHCARE AND EDUCATION.
>> I COMPLETELY DISAGREE.
>> IT'S FINE FOR YOU TO
DISAGREE.
I THINK THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY,
THE GOP HAS TO DECIDE WHEN IS IT
OKAY FOR BLACK ATHLETES AND
PERFORMERS TO SHUPT AND DRIBBLE
OR BECOME THE BEACON OF HOPE FOR
YOUR PARTY.
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
JESSE: HE DID BRING UP STOP AND
FRISK.
HE SAID HE DOESN'T LIKE TO AND
FRISK AND TOLD THE PRESIDENT TO
KNOCK IT OUT.
>> FOR YOU TO CALL IT A MINSTREL
SHOW YOU ARE DOING WHAT EVERY
OTHER BLACK PERSON IS DOING.
KANYE WEST TALKED ABOUT THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BLACK
PEOPLE AND THE POLICE.
HE TALKED ABOUT SUPPORTING THE
PRESIDENT AND MAKING AMERICA
GREAT.
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE FOUL
LANGUAGE WHEN YOU ARE IN THE
OVAL OFFICE.
YOU SHOULD NOT BANG ON THE TABLE
IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
JESSE: PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON
DID SOME PRETTY INDECENT THINGS
IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
>> THERE WASN'T ALL THIS OUTCRY
WHEN RICK ROSS WAS IN THE OVAL
OFFICE AND HIS ANKLE BRACELET
WENT OFF.
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU, DO YOU
WANT BLACK ATHLETES AND
ENTERTAINERS TO SHUT UP AND
DRIBBLE OR BECOME YOUR NEW
MASCOT.
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE
SHUTTING UP AND DRIBBLE.
IT'S ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE HAVING A
SEAT AT THE TABLE.
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT SO
CONTROVERSIAL FOR ANY BLACK
PERSON TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION.
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.
ONLY 8% OF BLACK PEOPLE VOTED
FOR TRUMP.
YOU CAN VOTE FOR TRUMP IF YOU
WANT TO.
BUT YOU SHOULD NOT VOTE FOR
