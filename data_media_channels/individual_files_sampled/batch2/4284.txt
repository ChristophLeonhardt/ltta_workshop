breaking news about this week's raid of President Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen his office and homes multiple people familiar with the components of the federal investigation into Cohen say investigators have requested all communications between two top tabloid executives and the attorney joining me NBC News investigations reporter Tom winter and back with us Kelly O'Donnell from the White House also MSNBC legal analysts been with us guys thanks for coming back first to you Tom what are the new details about your reporting okay Katie so based on discussions that we've had with folks that are familiar with the various components of this investigation my colleague Stephanie Gosk and I learning here that that the search warrant involving Michael Cohen was looking for all communications that were tied to two top American media incorporated company executives that's David pecker in Dylan Howard peckers the CEO and Howard is the chief content officer now American media incorporated probably doesn't mean much to a lot of people but one of their publications is the National Enquirer so that's obviously much more of a household name and there have been reporting there's been various reporting over the years that the president Trump or or people in his circle or in the Trump organization may have been behind payments to people to tell their exclusive stories to that publication and then that publication does not publish their actual stories or their accounts of specific incidents that have happened and some of those incidents have been reportedly perhaps negative or detrimental to president Trump's reputation so that's some of the reporting that's out there what we've learned and what the New York Times first reported is that the search warrant had to have a specific section where they requested any communications between Michael Cohen who is of course the president's personal attorney and these two top executives David pecker and Dylan Howard so that's what's new at this time and and that's this is just kind of helping us Katie kind of round out a little bit the the scope of the search warrant and in some of the various things that they're looking into obviously the heart of this is is payments made or a payment made allegedly to stormy Daniels and then and then some other aspects of this including the access hollywood tape we're all familiar with that so we're getting a little bit of a better understanding of the of the scope in what federal investigators are looking into so there are these new reports from The Associated Press and The New Yorker about I'm some pretty salacious allegations having to do with the doorman but Kelly O'Donnell it's not about the doorman or what he was saying it's more about this is another payoff that we're hearing about having to do with michael cohen of potentially trying to shield and protect the president in the lead-up to the 2016 election and when you look back beyond the time where the president was an official candidate if this extends back in the history of the trump organization or the president it's more about brand protection at that time and his public reputation and then sliding into this period where he became a candidate and then eventually president so contracts between individuals may not have any illegality one of the questions would be is there something that would represent an in-kind donation to the Trump campaign and that is where violations would need to be scrutinized so on the surface simply having these arrangements although it appears you know someone trying to hide something that may not be illegal at all what they would be looking for are bits of evidence that would suggest something that crossed a line with respect to elections law or if there was some other type of crime that would be something that might not have anything to do with the Russia investigation that's been going on this is one of those tangents that is very relatable people because they've seen the supermarket tabloids we've now heard about Michael Cohen yeah what is the real root of this and it's really trying to fund through communications you learn about potential agreements that may have been let's get to the legal aspect of that I've been rounded out for us talk to us about why this could potentially be problematic legally for the president well so I I mean I look at this you have to see the sort of whole pattern right which is that they're looking at the actions that Michael Cohen took to silence and to arrange payments to a particular group of people right a particular pair of people they're also looking at the action that these media organizations took presumably to quiet these or other actions and so I think you can you can say that the the investigation appears at least to be looking into actions taken to silence people or pay people to be silent rather than talking disparagingly about Donald Trump in the run-up to and and maybe before that of the election and so that can that can be you know can cross legal lines in any number of ways but I think the most interesting aspect of it from an investigative point of view is that they do seem interested in the pattern I want to know if this could potentially go back to Muller I know Muller handed this over to the SDN why gave them a tip about this could this go back to Muller if SD and why find something relevant to his investigation well so material federal law enforcement routinely shares information with other components of federal law enforcement and so if you know if an active investigation in New York were to produce information evidence that were germane to the special counsels investigation in Washington that could be shared back of course but in addition there is the question of you know whether the investigation itself can be subsumed into the special counsels investigation and that would be a question that would be decided by the Deputy Attorney General who is the of course the acting Attorney General supervising both of these investigations and where the jurisdictional lines are are getting Italy decided by him TomTom yeah well I was just gonna say very briefly if I have not to interrupt pin but just to reinforce what he's saying my understanding is that that's exactly what the case is here this is a investigation that while it may be in federal prosecutors lap in New York is very much in coordination with the specialist counsel's office we've seen this already one time in the in the course of this investigation so this absolutely be something that can be wrapped up and go back or certain components of it can go back to the special counsel's office there's nothing here that says that this can't go back or there's nothing here that the Tibetans point to say that they're not directly talking to each other pretty regularly I'm Kelly we only have about 20 seconds left and Katie we saw rod Rosen Stein here at the White House today meeting with the president we're told on unrelated matters part of his normal job but imagine the tension in the room given the backdrop of these circumstances the president furious on the surface upset about Rosen Stein giving the authorization for the steps that the Tom and Ben have been laying out from the investigative side so complicated days here at the White House Katie oh to be a fly on the wall during that meeting I know it's a cliche but it's never been more relevant than today hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date
