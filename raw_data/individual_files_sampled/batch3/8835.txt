IF NEWS HAPPEN WE WILL GO THERE. FIRST UP TO SPEED ON WHAT IS HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON. THE CRACK POLITICAL TEAM OVER AT THE "WASHINGTON POST" UNCOVERED A BRAND NEW SPECIES OF FAKE NEWS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT: ORIGINARY LEFT WINGONES. WING MOBS. THEY CAST THE TRUMP RESISTANT MOVEMENT AS AN ANGRY MOB. THE "WASHINGTON POST" WANTS YOU TO KNOW THESE MOBS ARE NOT REAL. THEY ARE AN ILLUSION. THAT MAY SURPRISE YOU. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN VIDEOS OF PROMINENT REPUBLICANS BEING CHASED OUT OF RESTAURANTS BY PROGRESSIVES AND READ HOW A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN WAS SHOT WITH A RIFLE BY A BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER. AND COLLEGE CAMPUSES DESCEND INTO RIOTING BECAUSE CONSERVATIVES SHOWED UP TO TALK. AND GROUPS OF HYSTERICAL YOUNG PEOPLE WHY WOULD AT LAWMAKERS. ALL OF THIS MAY HAVE GIVEN YOU THE MISTAKEN IMPRESSION THERE IS A THREAT OF DISORDER AND LAWLESSNESS FROM THE LEFT BUILDING IN THIS COUNTRY. SOME FUNDED BY A MAN THE "WASHINGTON POST" DESCRIBES AS A PHILANTHROPIST. THIS IS RACISM. IT'S DESIGNED SAYS THE POST FOR THE BENEFIT OF WHITE VOTERS PARTICULARLY MEN. THE ANGRY MOBS YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE WATCHING ON TELEVISION ARE MERELY A HALLUCINATION CONCOCTED BY FOX NEWS. YOU CAN WAKE UP NOW. NONE OF IT IS REAL. IT'S 1996 AGAIN. WAIT, HAS ANYONE TOLD THE ANGRY LEFT WING MOBS ABOUT THIS? THEY BELIEVE THEY EXIST. IN PORTLAND THEY ARE BLOCKING TRAFFIC AND BREAKING THINGS AND SCREAMING AT OLD LADIES IN WHEEL SHARE. THEY DON'T GET THE "WASHINGTON POST" IN OREGON. WATCH. . . . . . . . . Tucker: DON'T BELIEVE YOUR LYING EYES. SOME REPORTS DESCRIBE THE PROTESTORS AS ANTIFA. OTHERS SAY THEY ARE BLACK LIVES MATTER. IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE YOUTH WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTIES. THESE ARE THEIR SHOCK TROOPS. LISTEN TO MAXINE WATERS AND CORY BOOKER CALL THEM TO ARMS. GO TO THE HILL TODAY. GET UP AND IN THE FACE OF CONGRESS PEOPLE. IF YOU SEE ANYBODY FROM THAT CABINET IN A RESTAURANT, IN A DEPARTMENT STORE, AT A GAS STATION, YOU GET UP AND YOU TELL THEM THEY ARE NOT WELCOME! Tucker: GO GET THEM. GET IN THEIR FACE. THEY OBEYED. THE LEFT ALWAYS OBEYS. OBEDIENCE IS THE POINT OF THEIR PROGRAM. YOU WON'T EAT IN PEACE. ABOLISH ICE. . WELL, THANKS TO INCIDENTS LIKE THE ONE YOU JUST SAW AND THE ONE THE "WASHINGTON POST" ASURES YOU ARE DIDN'T REALLY HAPPEN. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT. PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY NEVERTHELESS ARE BECOMING CO CONCERNED. THAT'S ARREST THAT'S RACIST SAYS THE POST. THE WIFE OF SENATOR RAND PAUL IS SO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING, SHE KEEPS A LOADED GUN BY HER BED. WATCH. SO MANY UNHINGED PEOPLE AND UNSTABLE PEOPLE OUT THERE. WHEN THEY HEAR ON THEIR SIDE TELLING THEM GET UP IN THEIR FACE, THEY TAKE THAT LITERALLY. THEY THINK THAT GIVES THEM A LICENSE. THAT SCARES ME. WE UPDATED OUR SECURITY SYSTEMS AT HOME AND I SLEEP WITH A LOADED GUN BY MY BED. I USED TO FEEL SAFE. THAT'S CHANGE. Tucker: THE "WASHINGTON POST" MIGHT CALL HER PARANOID. MANY ON THE LEFT CELEBRATED WHEN HER HUSBAND WOUND UP IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER BEING ASSAULTED BY AN ANGREAL LIBERAL. ANGRY LIBERAL. MY HUSBAND HAD 6 BROKEN RIBS AND WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED. TO HAVE PEOPLE LIKE CHER AND BET MIDLER LAUGHING ON THE INTERNET AND LAUDING HIS ATTACKER, WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU? THAT YOU THINK THAT IS ACCEPTABLE? Tucker: THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION. THE VIDEO WE JUST SHOWED YOU IS REAL VIDEO. WE DIDN'T MAKE IT UP IN THE BASEMENT TO SCARE YOU OR TO WIN A MID-TERM. ASSESSING EVERYTHING YOU HAVE SEEN, YOU MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO CONCLUDE THAT MAYBE THERE IS A GROWING PROBLEM WITH LEFT WING MOB VIOLENCE. BUT LEFT WING LEADERS AND THEIR PROPAGANDA IN THE PRESS CONCLUDED THE EXACT OPPOSITE. THEY HAVE DECIDED THE PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY YOU. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM SITTING AT HOME. YOU ARE DANGEROUS. THE "NEW YORK TIMES" PAUL GRUDMAN ACCUSED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF HARBORING AUTHORIAN IMPULSES. HILLARY CLINTON IS SO WORRIED ABOUT THE ANGRY GRANDMOTHERED IN PORTLAND SMASHING WINDOWS, SHE KNOW LONGER CONSIDERS REPUBLICANS AMERICANS OR FULLY HUMAN. ACCORDING TO HILLARY CLINTON YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO BE CIVIL TO REPUBLICANS. YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO THEM BECAUSE THEY DESERVE IT. YOU CAN'T BE CIVIL WITH A POLITICAL PARTY THAT WANTS TO DESTROY WHAT YOU STAND FOR AND CARE ABOUT. I BELIEVE IF WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WIN BACK AND/OR THE SENATE, THAT'S WHEN CIVILITY CAN START AGAIN. Tucker: YEAH, SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. THERE IS THE MOST RECENT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. THE LEADER OF HER PARTY ENDORSING VICIOUSNESS AGAINST HER POLITICAL OPPONENT. ACCORDING TO THE "WASHINGTON
