as I always say everything is funny in life except for other people's suffering even evil itself would be hilarious if it weren't for the fact it caused other people to suffer for instance a group of Islamic knuckleheads with stupid beards who can't even look at the female half of God's creation without becoming disgusted with themselves in their own natural yearnings would be the height of hilarious absurdity if they would simply solve the problem in the most rational way by de creme that they themselves aren't allowed to go outside without wearing a blindfold instead of annoying innocent women by forcing them to hide their beauty under black sacks what sense does that make women whose lives are oppressed and constrained by a culture wide sexual neuroses are not funny stupid bearded guys wearing blindfolds and bumping into poles and tripping over curb stones that's funny after all if your eye offends you pluck it out or let me pluck it out that would also be funny likewise some dithering son of a nefarious Islamic dirtbag who feels his understanding of sin and apostasy confers on him the right to destroy the image of God and humanity could create a situation with amazing comic possibilities if you would simply do the sensible thing and blow himself to kingdom come in the privacy of his own moral cesspool without bothering the rest of us nothing ruins a laugh more than blowing up other people just because you happen to be an Islamist knucklehead on the other hand an Islamist knucklehead blowing himself to pieces and some out-of-the-way place would have a two-fold benefit one it would provide us with a top-notch chuckle fest and two it would blow up in Islam as knucklehead which has to be a good thing in and of itself if it weren't for the suffering it caused evil would be funny in the same way slapstick is funny because it shows us the noble creature God made slipping on the banana peel of what he was never meant to be if it weren't for the suffering evil would be funny because in our moments of loving forgiveness we know exactly how wondrously we are made while in our moments of brutality and stupidity and ugliness and Islamism but I repeat myself we see the redic worst of what we sometimes become evil would be good comic stuff except for the suffering all the same there is evil somewhere everyday and suffering somewhere every day and yet every day we are tasked with the responsibility to rejoice we rejoice because we know who we are meant to be and we know that we will someday become that again and we know that in the end we will have the last laugh trigger warning i'm andrew Clavin and this is the andrew Clavin show
