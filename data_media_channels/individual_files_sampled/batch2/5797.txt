collusion did it happen did Donald Trump directly collude with Russia to impact the election we don't know the public evidence does not say that he did as I've often noted when reporting on this story over a year later there's still no public evidence of fully executed collusion I don't think we're gonna be ahead of the investigators in the spies we do know that key people in the Trump campaign committed other crimes because they admitted it after Miller caught them but now some people are using the charges Muller has filed to argue that maybe this is all he has that if he didn't charge other things yet maybe they never happened that very argument came up in a discussion we were just having on MSNBC this week with Jonathan Turley a skeptic of collusion who Donald Trump quoted this week he is of course a respected law professor and he emphasizes there are no indictments about collusion as you know I'm very skeptical about the suggestion that there is a collusion case to be made against the president or even an obstruction case on the evidence that we have and I think to be fair to the White House is that we do have a year of indictments plea agreements it's what are called speaking and diamonds that give elaborate narratives they conspicuously don't include any type of Nexus or suggestion of collusion the claim there is that if Muller did not indict something maybe it did not happen it almost sounds rational but it does have a logical hole plenty of crimes never get charged people steal a lot of cars but 82 percent of property crimes are never charged a point I raised in that discussion professor Turley makes very erudite arguments tonight today this morning and that's I think why the president tweets what he says obviously because of his erudition just messing with you John he tweeted with you because agrees with you or agrees with the quote of you I should say but I will point out respectfully one potential logical hole in the case that the professor makes which is well if Bob Muller hasn't said something does that mean it hasn't happened that was part of the legal logical implication well Bob Miller has not done any indictments about the criminal hacking the felonious hacking that took place everyone knows it's a crime you cannot steal property you cannot steal digital property emails were Haggadahs no matter whose emails there were they could have been Donald Trump's emails or John Podesta C mails they happen in this case to be Podesta's emails we know that was a federal American felony there has been zero indictments on it yet all that tells me is they either haven't found the people or it's coming later it doesn't tell me that it didn't happen and let's extend this logic tonight - what Muller is probing the four key things under investigation a Russia's election interference online their hack of democratic emails the Americans who cover up lie or obstruct this probe and then of course the big one potential us collusion so take each of these things did they happen well US authorities say interference yes hack yes the cover-up yes as for the Trump campaign collusion while still totally undetermined now turn to what Muller has indicted so far on the interference yes 13 Russians already on the hack know nine months into this probe no one's been indicted for the email hack the cover-up yes the most common charge against Americans so far has been lying and then there's the collusion and empty box no indictments now if you look at that why does that matter right now well understanding the difference between whether a crime occurred and whether it has been charged actually shines a light on where this probe is headed and professor Turley who Trump is quoting said he doubts collusion because after a year of indictments and please they conspicuously don't include the Nexus or suggestion of collusion that's just an argument that because something hasn't been criminally charged it didn't happen but the lack of charges doesn't legally determine whether the underlying thing happened take what we know to date those two empty boxes on the right one is for a conduct that did happen the hacks the other is for conduct that is undetermined the collusion it would be silly to argue either empty box proves what happened in fact as we mentioned earlier tonight a story breaking right now is that molars eyeing the email hack to assemble charges against Russians for hacking and leaking emails to hurt Democrats so actually Muller may be looking to check that very box on the board which would only leave the collusion box unchecked and maybe that box will stay empty as I've reported we don't know whether it's charged though does not answer the existential question of what happened and that's an important legal distinction for one of the most important stories of our time now with respect to Professor Turley I would leave this all right here but then after what I showed you he wrote an op-ed about our colloquy and he discussed it on Fox News arguing collusion is a quote conspiracy theory and he wrote quote mel burst said i was assuming that the absence of evidence means that a case could not be made no that's not right I was talking about the absence of indictments which I've explained tonight and why it's wrong to think a missing indictment would mean something did not happen he is talking about the absence of evidence his point is a good one that there can be evidence that comes out later but I actually stated that more evidence could come forward I was speaking of the evidence that's available at this time he was referring to a tweet that the president had sent out that quoted me saying that I was skeptical about collusion based on the evidence that we know it so it's somewhat ironic to hear you know this doesn't mean that if Muller doesn't have something else well of course it doesn't I but you know the lack of knowing that hasn't stopped many people from arguing that there is a lead-pipe cinch of a case of collusion the very last part is fair there is no lead-pipe case of collusion right now and I look forward to discussing all of this with the professor again I just had to fact-check that last part because the details matter as Drake once said you can't listen to me talk and go tell my story no it don't work like that when you love somebody I love you professor and I know that we both love the law now as for the largest question hanging over this whole pro did collusion happen and if so will it be charged anyone prejudging that outcome let's know a lot more than Bob Muller and unlike some legal experts I can't put myself in that category there's been absolutely no collusion there's been no collusion between us and the Russians in the meantime no collusion no obstruction as we said there's no collusion there's no collusion whatsoever but a lot of lawyers thought that was pretty sad hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
