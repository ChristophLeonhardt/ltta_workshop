1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,230
A COMPANY HAS JUST
PROPOSED A NEW TYPE OF SEATING

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,809
ARRANGEMENT THAT SOME AIRLINES
MIGHT LIKE THAT THERE IS NOT AN

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,570
AIRLINE THAT MENTION THEY WILL
DO THIS BUT AVIOINTERIORS HAS

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,000
COME UP WITH STANDING UP AIRLINE
Ã± AIRPLANE SEATS.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
THEY LOOK LIKE

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,050
THE TYPES OF SEATS YOU WOULD SEE
ON A ROLLER COASTER.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,050
THEY LOOK

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,390
INCREDIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND
THEY BRAG ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,410
WILL HELP AIRLINES SQUEEZE IN
MORE PASSENGERS.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,409
THEY SAY THEY

11
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:37,020
CAN FIT UP TO 20% MORE PEOPLE ON
A PLANE SHOULD AIRLINE COMPANIES

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,980
DECIDE TO INCORPORATE THESE
SEATS ON THEIR PLANES.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,140
>>THEY THROW IN THE FREE PUNCH
IN THE FACE JUST FOR KICKS.

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,690
EVENTUALLY THEY WILL TURN THE
SEATS THIS WAY SO THEY WILL HAVE

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,050
ROWS OF UP LINED UP, KIND OF
LIKE HOW SOME OF US GOT HERE IN

16
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,800
THE FIRST PLACE.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,230
ARE THERE NO
BOUNDS OF REASON?

18
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,230
WE ARE NOT

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,570
EVEN ALLOWED TO SIT ANYMORE ON
PLANES?

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,569
MADNESS.

21
00:01:04,569 --> 00:00:00,000
I VOTE NO.
