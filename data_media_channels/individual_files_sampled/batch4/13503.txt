welcome to the show everybody thanks for watching thank you for listening hope you've had a great morning so far I want to I don't mean to disturb you but I want to start with two stories they're sort of harrowing stories that I want to tell just just to start with because it relates to the subject at hand so here's the first story these are both true stories by the way last week I went into a cafe in DC and I really needed to use the bathroom so I went in and I said where's your bathroom and they said bathrooms are for customers only and so clearly the next thing that I did was I called the FBI for because it was a hate crime I mean what how also you're supposed to how else can you respond to something like that no actually what I did was I I said oh okay and then I bought a coffee and then I said can you hold the coffee here for a minute I'm gonna use the bathroom because it's it's actually the concept of a restaurant or a store only allowing customers to use the facilities that's a really normal concept in the world that I live in which is just reality where a great many stores and restaurants have that policy now here's the second story again totally a true story this didn't happen to me but I did witness it and I was traumatized by it I was at a Starbucks a few months ago and I was sitting there doing my work money minding my own business there was a guy it wasn't even that busy by the way but there was a guy at a table few tables over from me and he was I noticed he was just sitting there at the table for a little bit it wasn't drinking any coffee didn't buy anything and they falls asleep and he's like sleeping at the table for only a couple of minutes and until the manager comes over and wakes him up and says you're gonna have to leave you can't sleep here and so the guy packs up his stuff and leaves there's a white guy by the way you know I didn't even realize it at the time but but apparently I witnessed a horrible human rights infringement because this guy had a human right to come in to private property and use it as a you know a camping ground if he wanted to now I tell these stories because they were late to the obviously the Starbucks controversy which has been raging and still hasn't calmed down over the last few days and the latest on that let me see if I could find out just looking at the story The Daily wire has the story that on Tuesday Starbucks announced that the company is going to close over 8,000 stores across the United States next month to conduct racial bias education geared toward preventing discrimination in their stores so that's approximately 175,000 Starbucks employees who now will have to undergo racial bias or you know discrimination training because of these two incidents that happened at two different Starbucks locations over the last few days if you're not familiar just very quickly I'll get you up to speed there have been protests and boycotts and everything because of these two incidents the first incident happened in a Starbucks in Philadelphia a video surfaced and went viral of two black men being escorted out of a Starbucks in cuffs they were being arrested in handcuffs it's a you know pretty short video and there's not a lot to it there's not you know we don't see what happened before then or after we just see these guys being escorted out not a lot of details but just the image of two black men being arrested and removed from a Starbucks that was enough in the minds of a lot of people the minds of the pitchfork pitchfork mob especially that was enough to prove that what clearly there's racism here I mean there couldn't possibly be any other explanation at all it must be racism because these two guys were black then so that was that was that enough of a controversy and then on Monday I don't know if it was on Monday but yeah it was on Monday a Starbucks in Los Angeles went viral because there was video shot by a black man who went into this Starbucks asked to use the restroom and they said well restrooms are for customers only now again very normal policy especially especially now maybe if you live in a more rural area if you live in the suburbs maybe you don't encounter it as much but at urban restaurants and stores where there are a lot of people coming in and out this is extremely common in fact it's the norm it's I I can't remember the last time I went into a you know of a restaurant in a city and they would just let anyone use the bathroom even if they weren't customers so really normal policy this guy he couldn't responded the way that I did when I was in DC and I was told the same thing and that is just buy something buy a coffee buy a you know just buy a buy a cup of yogurt I mean buy anything and then you can use the restroom but that's not what this guy does instead he pulls out of his camera and he pulls out his phone and he starts taking video then a white guy walks out of the restroom and without asking by the way you know this the the black guy comes up to the white guy puts him on camera doesn't ask his permission and he finds out that the white guy apparently hadn't bought anything either yet he was allowed to use the bathroom so that proves racism then he goes up to the manager who by the way does not appear to be white herself she's a woman appears to be not sure what her race is but she appears to be a non white woman and he starts berating her for her supposed racial bias and in both cases that's enough for the pitchfork mob and so now you know Starbucks is in is in cleanup mode the Starbucks CEO just absolutely threw his own employees under the bus this the manager at the Philadelphia location he just threw or under the bus didn't even try to defend her and now he's been he met with the mayor of Philadelphia he's met with you know activist he met with the two men who were arrested he's been guilty he was like Good Morning America I mean he's been meeting with it he met with he met with I think he met with the king of Saudi Arabia as well for some reason I mean just meeting with everybody talking about this and just throwing his employees under the bus in the process and even this racial bias discrimination training you're essentially throwing your employees under the bus again what you're implying I mean if you're forcing 175,000 employees to undergo this bias training what you're insinuating is that a lot of them are racially biased now here's the thing a couple things first of all I'm not a fan of Starbucks policy I do like their product I'll admit I know a lot of people don't they say it tastes burnt but I guess I like burnt coffee so I like their burnt coffee not a fan of their politics so I'm not one to usually defend Starbucks but even less am I a fan of pitchfork mobs and I know that sometimes conservatives will tend to when they see something like this they see the liberal pitchfork mob coming after a liberal company the Conservatives will sit back and say oh isn't this nice isn't this nice to watch this happens see there being being hoisted with their own petard that's a that's a nice thing to see well I think it's a really bad idea I've said this many times it's a bad idea to take the side of the pitchfork mob in any situation no matter who they're coming after I mean the pitchfork mob should always be stood against so that's the first thing the second thing is you know I don't know that this this manager the Philadelphia location she doesn't work there anymore I guess she got fired the manager at law in the Los Angeles location maybe they're racist I don't know I can't I don't know them personally I can't say for sure they aren't but there's that there are quite a few reasons to suspect that there are probably other explanations and what we should do if we are rational and honest people and we're you know and we're decent people as well then we're not going to immediately assume when something like this happens we're not going to immediately assume oh well it must be racism we're not just going to leapfrog over all of the other possible explanations and say nope it's none of them it's got to be racism so what are some other possible explanations well we know in the K in the case of Philadelphia let's take them one at a time Philadelphia the two men were sitting in the store taking up seats they hadn't actually purchased anything this is loitering it's trespassing the these restaurants do not exist as just public forums to for you to just come in and hang out anytime you want it they own it they set the rules for engagement and their rules for engagement are I think pretty reasonable pretty clear pretty simple you got to buy something if you want to sit at the table because there are a lot of here's what happens there are a lot of customers who do buy something and they would like to have a table to sit at but you're taking up the table even though you didn't buy anything and that's not fair and so that's why these companies have rules against it now it just so happens that this particular location in Philadelphia has had apparently a problem with loitering recently and so this has been a policy that they've been focusing on more and more and they've had to enforce so the store employees tried to deal with the situation calmly and peacefully and reasonably and they told the men that look you know if you're not gonna buy anything then you have to leave the two guys refused to leave they refused to leave the store okay even though they were told you got to buy something or leave they said apparently they said we're not gonna buy anything and we're not gonna leave either um and then the employee said okay well then we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna call the police and apparently what the two men said was we'll go ahead and call them in we're still not gonna leave then the police arrived and they're negotiating with these men for several minutes and saying look you just need to leave you can't it's not it's private property you can't just hang out here if you're not a customer and they still refuse to leave so let's go let's go through the let's go through the process here okay step one we have them deciding not to buy anything and take up a table step two even when they're told well if you're not gonna buy anything you got to leave they still refuse to leave step three the police show up and say well you gotta leave and they still refused so then they got arrested now of course it's in its claim that the white beat that it's claimed that well you know white people loiter at Starbucks all the time and they're never asked to leave really I mean do you know that that's quite a thing to just declare well white white people are never told to leave Starbucks how do you know you're you're telling me it never happens you know that for a fact you know that a dislocation in Philadelphia they have never asked white people to leave for loitering do you know that because if you know it I mean let please provide your evidence because that would be very significant I mean if you had evidence that they frequently allow white people to loiter and never enforce the rules against white people but then they do against black people well then that is compelling evidence of racial discrimination and then the protests are warranted in fact the protest wouldn't even be warranted even in that case because it's that would still just be one manager who's now fired who's guilty but at least they'd be more warranted than they are now so if you have evidence of that then you know I can tell you that I have I just told you I have seen myself at a Starbucks a white person being kicked out for loitering so I know it does happen and I'm betting it's happen at this Philadelphia location because that's see that's the thing if let's say this manager whoever this person is is just uncontrollably uncontainable racist I mean they're so racist that they would just that they would actually kick out two black men simply for being black I mean that is that's not just racist that is that's like racism on steroids that is you're so racist that you're gonna even give up your job because that's what you're doing that's what the manager will be doing in that case the manager is saying you know I'm gonna forfeit this job just so I can make a racist statement against these black men which is possible but then the question is how did this manager manage to survive and function at a Starbucks in Philadelphia if there's that racist against black people because I would assume and I'm just assuming but I think it's pretty safe assumption that this Starbucks in Philadelphia we're not talking about a Starbucks in the middle of a you know a town of 500 and not in North Dakota okay Starbucks in Philadelphia they probably have black customers coming in and out of that store hundreds of times a week if not a day and so has this manager I mean has she is that does she always do this if she so races against black people why is this the first time she's kicked out black people when there's been so many others she could have kicked out and she didn't it just it just doesn't make a lot of sense it's possible it just doesn't a lot of sense now then we have the incident in Los Angeles now that that one to me is even less of a I mean that went to me is so clearly it's very clear that the guy came in looking for he want that's why he pulled out the video it's not a normal if you're just innocently there and you just want to use the bathroom and someone tells you okay well you know you got to buy something to use the bathroom if your response is to pull out a camera and start taking a video for Twitter that means that this is what you were looking for okay this is not this one this wasn't an innocent request in your part you were looking for this exact response so that you could try to entrap them in some fake false racism claim but if the question is well okay well why did they they said they they they they said no to the black guy but the white guy was allowed to to use the bathroom even though he didn't buy anything you know must be racism could be or you know there are other explanations it's possible that the white guy is a regular customer he's there all the time they know him they know that he's gonna buy something so they let him use the bathroom first I mean to me as just a logical person if that would be my first assumption I would think it's probably that because regular customers frequently get privileges that non regular customers don't get I have several coffee shops that I go through all the time and they'll have my order ready for me before I even get up to the debt to the to the counter I get free refills okay I get all this stuff because I'm there all the time and I'm practically keeping them in business on my own so could that be the explanation should we at least consider that explanation before we leap right to oh it must be racism it must be that this non-white woman working at a Starbucks in in Los Angeles harbors this grudge against black people I mean again possible but given the context in the situation that would not even be close to my first assumption so of course everything I'm saying it doesn't matter because I can't you know you can't calm down the mob and and these employees they don't even have their CEO behind them so it's just it's a done deal but we do have to consider and think about I mean what's the what's the implication here because now what Starbucks has done now is they have now announced that you're allowed to loiter in their source it's this is what the CEO by apologizing profusely on behalf of a manager who was simply enforcing rules against loitering by doing that what he has declared to everybody in America is well at least if you're not white you're allowed to loiter I mean come on in use the Wi-Fi sit down and use the bathrooms you don't have to buy anything in fact bring your own packed lunch bring up bring your own dinner spread and just you know just sit out and bring the family and just set up you get set up set up a blanket there on the ground and have a picnic it's basically what they have announced they can't enforce rules against loitering anymore there's a reason why I I when it comes to situations like this I tend very often to fall on the side of the private company I'll tell you something I felt the same I was saying the same thing with that with the whole controversy with whatever airline it was I'm forgetting which airline wasn't where they dragged the guy out because he wouldn't give up his seat and I sided with the airline on that you know why because even if it's an unfair policy when you're sitting in their establishment or in their airplane and they tell you to leave you have to leave they own it you don't you can't access sighs some right over and above their own right to their own property it's a very dangerous game we start playing when we tell people that you now have a human right to just march into a private establishment and just stay there even if they tell you to leave even if the police tell you to leave you don't have to know I I I think that that said that the implications are very dangerous so most of the time I'm gonna tend to side with the private company whether the policy is fair or not at the end of the day they it's their business it's their building it's their plane they exercise authority offer it and you have to play by their rules if you want to use their property this to me is just is just a basic rule of living in a free and decent and civilized society but we live in such a society less and less I suppose so there it is there's my contrarian take on the Starbucks situation thanks for watching thanks for listening everybody I'll talk to you tomorrow you
