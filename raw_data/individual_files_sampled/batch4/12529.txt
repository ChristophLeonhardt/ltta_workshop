just when you thought tax reform couldn't get any better the worst people on earth voted today to save taxpayers billions of more dollars despite warnings from nikki Haley and President Trump the United Nations voted 128 to 9 to condemn the United States for moving its embassy in Israel to the capital of Israel the United States has two words for those countries and they're not Merry Christmas so those countries might not lose foreign aid we will explain why President Trump should go further and defund the UN fala Lala lalalala then the mailbag I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Nolt show what a glorious news cycle this is the last show before Christmas before New Year's we're gonna not gonna be on the air next week and we're gonna do a nice little Christmas show but Nikki hailey gave us an extra present how sweet before we get to any of that I've got to tell you about thrive market this was another Christmas present that came in early we have another sponsor and these guys are great I told you Shapiro's hasn't paid me since he gave me that election bet check so I really count on freebies from sponsors this one is really really good this is thrive market it is the greatest new online store they sell all of the top organic and healthy products at 25 to 50% off ship straight to your door next to each project at a product rather it shows a retail price and then it shows the thrive market price so you can see exactly how much you're saving now I know you're looking at me I don't look exactly like the kind of guy who eats healthy all of the time that's true but sweet little Alisa my fiancee she does she cooks healthy Sheila this is a really great service so you get the best quality product thrive market has all the top premium healthy organic products that you usually get from the grocery store but unlike your typical grocery and non-gmo products that are marked up to crazy prices thrive market sells the same organic and non-gmo premium products at wholesale prices so one of the other reasons that I don't always buy the healthiest foods is of course because I don't receive a salary but now now fortunately thanks to thrive market that is much less of an issue so how do they do it the way they do it is they cut out all of the middlemen that goes directly to you they work directly with brands they pass all of the savings on to their members they also give back which is really nice so whoever whenever you sign up for one of these memberships they'll will give one to someone who is a veteran or low income family or a teacher so together they make healthy living affordable to everyone if left to my own devices I would just eat like week-old sausage and swaddled in my own filth in my apartment thankfully there are like there's my fiancee sweet little ELISA and people who try to help you to live a healthier lifestyle that we can all do that together it's a really really great model it's much easier than the grocery store to as a millennial myself I never want to leave a chair I would've used with my chair I never leave my computer my phone that's perfect I don't think I've been to a grocery store in like a year fortunately its rivals bring everything to you it's also a curated catalogue so sometime you go to the grocery store and they have 350 different kinds of olive oil and you think well I can't really decide which the best olive oil is so thrive market curates all of its selections they'll have two or three and you know you're getting the best they do all of the homework for you and today this is an extra

artwork around here it plays music so I was gonna do this nice show about Christmas but then then this wonderful speech came out from about the United Nations so Nikki Haley turns my home warning around here she is ahead of a vote by the UN General Assembly condemning the United States for moving our embassy in Israel to the capital of Israel the United States is by far the single largest contributor to the United Nations and its agencies when a nation is singled out for attack in this organization that nation is disrespected what's more that nation is asked to pay for the privilege of being disrespected the United States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation we will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the world's largest contribution to the United Nations and we will remember when so many countries come calling on us as they so often do to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit be still my beating heart oh my god I just want to watch it like three more times this is so beautiful this is the sort of thing we've been waiting to see from the United Nations for a long time she has been wonderful in this role so she's laying down the SmackDown President Trump warned people to nevertheless undeterred the United Nations voted 128 to 9 to condemn the United States the only nations that voted against this resolution are Guatemala Honduras Israel Marshall Islands Micronesia Nauru Palau Togo and the United States a bunch of other islands rather a bunch of other nations abstained Antigua Barbuda Argentina Australia Bahamas Benin Bhutan Bosnia Cameroon Canada Colombia Croatia check dr Equatorial Guinea Fiji Haiti Hungary Jamaica Kiribati Latvia Lesotho Malawi Mexico Panama Philippines Poland Romania Rwanda Solomon Island South Sudan Trinidad and Tobago Tuvalu Uganda and Van out to Vanuatu but where are our allies where are our allies you might remember that you can't even pronounce most of those names because you don't hear the United Nation or the United Kingdom you don't hear France you don't hear Italy a lot of our allies voted against us 128 different nations including our allies voted to condemn the United States at the UN for exercising and sovereign right to establish embassies where it so pleases so we might cut their foreign aid and listen to them whine the Turkish Foreign Minister nevelot Cavazos Lew said we were all asked to vote no or face concept winces some even threatened to cut development aid some the United States the people that give you development aid this is bullying it is unethical to think that the votes and dignity of member states are for sale is that right okay that's fine but you can't stand on your box and preen and moralize well you've got your handout taking money good luck guys that's okay you want to vote how you want you want to bite the hand that feeds you you want to condemn the greatest force for peace and prosperity in the history of the world the only reason that we've had peace relative peace for a century or three-quarters of a century fine fine by me go ahead guys back-to-back world war winners that that's absolutely fine but we don't need to give you money let's go over some numbers the United States pays twenty eight point five percent of the 7.3 billion dollar UN peacekeeping budget we pay twenty two percent of the core budget of 2.7 billion dollars since 1948 since it was founded the United Nations has spent almost 109 billion dollars on peacekeeping missions now countries speaking in support of this measure today were North Korea Yemen Turkey Venezuela Cuba Syria South Africa and Iran not to be outdone Hamas also praised the resolution you're known by the friends you keep so why exactly do we have it why do we have the UN we have the worst people in the world standing up and condemning us for this former UN Ambassador John Bolton sums it up point that I want to leave with you in this very brief presentation is where I started is there is no United Nations there is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and that's the United States when it suits our interest and when we can get others to go along Secretariat building in New York has 38 stories if you lost 10 stories today it would make a bit of difference this kind of mindless creation of the United Nations as something different than what it's in the United States interest do isn't gonna sell here or anywhere else the United States makes the UN work when it wants it to work and that is exactly the way it could be because the only question the only question to the United States is what's in our national interest and if you don't like that I'm sorry but that is the fact I love who so much one of the greatest things the president george w bush ever did was make that man the ambassador to the united nations III one time had lunch with a former UN Ambassador and I said is it possible for a Republican to be the UN Ambassador you know is it possible to be an ambassador to the United Nations and still support the United Nations and he said yes you have to support the basic mission of the United Nations unless your John Bolton you can get out of it is really beautiful and he sums it up exactly as it is now during the Cold War the United Nations stayed out of the peacekeeping business why is that because you had the brink of glow a global nuclear conflict and all of these little peacekeeping endeavors would have been proxy wars between the United States and the Soviet Union so let's just look since the 90s after the Cold War humanitarian crises in the Balkans Somalia and Cambodia led the UN to dramatically increase its peace operations funding and yet despite all of the additional funding and activity it utterly failed it failed utterly it failed in Somalia it failed in the Rwandan genocide it failed in Bosnia according to the high-level independent panel on UN peace operations quote more than 98 percent of military and police personnel deployed in UN peacekeeping missions today have a mandate to protect civilians as part of integrated mission wide efforts the UN has deployed peacekeeping missions on 70 occasions over the past 70 or so years it has sort of succeeded in two of them Sierra Leone in the early 2000s Burundi later that decade it only even intervened to protect civilians in 20% of the cases for which it was authorized to do so by the UN Security Council that's its main mandate 98 percent mandate only 20% of the time didn't even try to come through at 2007 UN office of internal oversight services report showed that 40% of peacekeeping contracts analyzed contained significant corruption schemes to the tune of 619 million dollars 40% of the ones that just the ones that were analyzed the UN mission in Sudan alone squandered tens of millions of dollars in mismanagement waste fraud and corruption now we've recently discovered widespread fraud by UN peacekeepers in Western Sahara peacekeepers illegally reselling food in Lebanon that's where our investments are going that's where our charity is going to enrich peacekeepers selling of UN peacekeeping jobs in Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo the most ironically named country in the history of the world these are just the corruption cases that happen to have been exposed there are plenty of others the UN is classically very secretive with its own internal operations those are just the ones we know about in 1975 the UN adopted the resolution Zionism is racism you'll notice a running theme at the UN they're not a big fan of the Jews you know now that in the history of the world many people have tried to kill the Jews this has not changed over time they're God's chosen people it's not terribly surprising that this would happen it's the central failure though of the United Nations which is moral relativism the UN during its founding period was much much better than it is today because it was limited to countries that had declared war against the Axis powers in World War two so yes it might have included Stalin it wasn't all great wonderful Western liberal democracies but it exclusively kept people out who had been on the wrong side of that war had been on the side of evil clear evil the modern UN bears no relationship to this whatsoever in 2011 this is unbelievable in 2011 the United Nations General Assembly held a moment of silence to honor a deceased leader of a country do you know who that leader was marshal do you have any idea yeah that would be Kim jong-il the dictator of North Korea one of the worst people ever deliv they held a moment of silence to honor him it is we have to end the United Nations we have to defund it I see two options here either we can admit the reality of this they admit the reality that John Bolton is talking about and say there is no such thing as a United Nations this is a ridiculous fiction the United States is the global superpower we're going to do what we want to do we're perfectly happy to listen to other people's ideas we're perfectly happy to form coalition's but we're not going to pretend that little nations or little nations that aren't even really nations there would be nations they get to tell us what to do they have an equal seat at the table is the United States we can call it the American forum we're happy to pay for the whole thing we're happy to host it and these terrible terrible people can come groveling to us and beg our mercy and beg our forgiveness and beg us to help them and we'd be perfectly happy to assume that global leadership and consider their proposals that's one world or they can have their United Nations that's perfectly fine we'll pay the twenty thousand dollars a year that many of those countries pay virtually nothing will contribute very little they don't get to come to our soil right now the United Nations is hosted in New York City it is ludicrous it is one of the most ludicrous aspects of American foreign policy that with regard to the United Nations we invite the worst people on earth to come to our soil to come to our best city the best city in the world and then stand on a platform and criticizes and condemn us horrible human rights abusers brutal tyrants butchers themselves get to stand on our soil in our city and condemn us for what for nothing because we try to stop them when they brutalize their own people so that's fine if they want to have a United Nations maybe we'll even participate you don't get our money you don't get to do it in our country host it in your country see how that works you pay for the security for it to work in your country absolutely fine by me it is a fiction there's a feeling I think among people of the old liberal consensus or on the Left who say well it helps us to exert influence in the world we can exert as much influence in the world as we like we don't need to play into any fictions the United Nations has utterly failed when it's tried to intervene in humanitarian conflicts it has made matters worse it has made chaos in the world worse because it's given voices to terrible people who should shut their mouths at the end of our guns that were they should be totally understand that they're our allies in this world led by the United States who will put them down UN peacekeepers they don't protect the peace they don't protect civilians get rid of it there isn't any argument for it I'm glad that we've it appears that the Trump administration has trolled them doing it into doing exactly what he's wanted to do since the beginning which is defund this ridiculous institution they should knock down that building and turn it into the new Trump Towers on the East River I think it'd be very beautiful I'm flying out to New York tonight I'll start scoping out the land there's a great cigar bar nearby maybe I'll buy a room when it becomes Trump Tower okay enough on the UN we're gonna have such a nice show today about the Nativity and the Incarnation but they get you so riled up these awful awful people and it's just really wonderful that finally after eight years of Barack Obama who bungled every aspect of American leadership in the world we have people with the moral clarity like nikki Haley who's sitting at the UN and incredibly too many Donald Trump who has moral clarity on world leadership let's get into the mailbag the first question comes from John hey Michael aka Hillary's third cousin two times removed I noticed a common debate among liberals is that the reason there is a cycle of poverty in black communities is because the schools are poorly funded what is your take on this can we expect people to rise out of poverty when their education is lacking funding and where can this funding come from when the communities are struggling thank you John I've heard this before too a lot of people talk about this we need to find we shouldn't have any Wars we shouldn't have any security operations we shouldn't build a wall we need to fund the schools because there are racial disparities racial disparities in success are caused by school funding the trouble with this theory is that it isn't true so Columbia University's Linda darling-hammond claimed this the n-double a-c-p claims this the College Board President Gaston Caperton declared quote tests are not the problem the problem we have is an unfair education system in America an unequal education system so two things here first increasing school spending has rarely led to better outcomes second according to the US Department of Education assumed funding disparities between racial and ethnic groups do not exist that's according to the Department of Education ironically though so the the trope the myth is that much more money is spent on white students than any other race of students ironically the opposite is true more money in the United States is spent on minority students than white students nationally and regionally this is according to the US Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics so nationally a black students get 105 percent of funding so an additional 5% of funding than white students Hispanic students get 1% more funding Asian students get 7% more funding when you break it down regionally in the northeast black students get per student 16% more funding Hispanic students 17% more funding Asian students 12% more funding in the South even in the south that awful terrible rural South backwards Jim Crow black students get 5% more funding Hispanic students get 3% more Asian students get 9% more in the Midwest black students get 13% more Hispanic students get 6% more Asian students get 11% more and in the West black students get 11 % more Hispanic students get 6% more Asian students get 8% more it's a total lie to talk about discrepancies because it's exactly the opposite of what the left says it is now in perspective black students receive over two thousand dollars more than white student in per pupil funding each and every year why are there disparities in educational attainment or in poverty you you'd have to there are many many factors of this some historical some cultural but I would look at the culture there are some immigrant groups succeed in the United States some immigrant groups do not succeed in the United States some native groups succeed some non-native group some native groups succeed at lower rates I think culture is the answer culture is what we worship it comes for it comes from the same word as cult what we're looking to cultures that emphasize two-parent households and not having children out of wedlock and getting married and saving money and having education and pursuing professional careers will succeed at higher rates what would the single greatest predictor of financial success in the United States is being born to a two family home now when it comes to the black community something like three-quarters of black babies in the United States are born out of wedlock this is a major cultural issue it's only been happening for the last 50 years or so so sit before the Great Society before Democrats and LBJ decided that they were going to explode the welfare state to help to ostensibly help black families black murder rates were going down poverty was going down everything was going right for that community of Americans since that time all of those trends have reversed we have to look at culture and we have to look at perverse government incentives that have that have ravaged the the black community if you want to really be able to explain and fix different levels of attainment oK we've got many more questions to change your life but if you're not on daily wire.com you won't be able to see them it's Christmas treat yourself we are what were four days away from Christmas now go to daily wire calm it costs $10 a month or $100 for an annual membership what do you get for that you get me you get the Andrew Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get no ads on the website it's none of that matters we are about to have a blizzard folks this has been an incredible year just just a quick little recap we've got major tax reform Obamacare mandate repealed Isis defeated militarily consumer confidence at all time highs markets at all-time highs we've got four percent projected economic growth which Obama's economists told us was absolutely impossible we have originalist justice on the Supreme Court we have original lists I think twenty eight originalist appointed to federal courts massive deregulation deregulation that we haven't seen in decade upon decade probably since Coolidge something like zero net new regulations this year compared to it an annual average of 13,000 we've got Pro energy policies going into effect we're gonna be looking at drilling in Anwar you are gonna be covered in a blizzard get your leftist tears tumblr before those salty little snowflakes rain down on you and crush you this is very dangerous this time of year you could get hypothermia or frostbite from all of the or you'll just be dried out from all the salt so go to Daley wire.com right now we'll be right back next question is from Jacob Jacob says hi Michael I'm a veteran thank you very service and I've dealt with suicide and mental health issues myself how do you think the suicide problem in the veteran community can be fixed because as of now on average 22 veterans commit suicide per day very sorry to hear about that Jacob one thing I hope is that you're getting a treatment for mental health so that you're seeing a psychiatrist who can help you it's also good to see a priest it's also good to see someone who can help you on the spiritual side of that but you should see a medical professional as well and it's especially good if you see a medical professional who shares your spiritual views as well that is a very effective way to be treated for these tough issues now we see the story a lot there is a national epidemic of suicide among veterans those numbers are a little misleading so I hope that you don't feel like you're being washed away in just a tidal wave of suicides because the situation actually isn't quite as bleak as that so the vast majority of these suicides are among older veterans national suicide rate among military veterans is 38.4 per 100,000 and this is higher than average but nationally just men in their 50s alone commit suicide at around 30 30 per 100,000 so it is higher it's significantly higher among veterans but compared to 95% of military veterans are men the majority of these suicides are vast majority or older men so the numbers actually are much more in line with the general population than people would think mostly because most of these suicides are being committed by older men so nationally also there's one completed suicide for every 25 suicide attempts the trouble is military veterans on average are more likely to have firearms and to know how to use them so there they complete suicide much more than the general population this is all really tough stuff obviously military service can take a major toll and this culture takes a major toll suicide numbers are up after years of declining suus members are increasing among the general population there are with regard to veterans obviously mental health access is really important and the total failure of the Veteran Affairs administration is to blame for a lot of this all of my veteran friends without exception have great difficulty accessing the VA this is awful Democrats want to expand this to cover all of our health care and they shouldn't look at the failures of the VA and the failure on veterans and let that be a lesson to everybody when it comes to nationalized or socialist health care so right now one of the reason that the suicide rate is increasing possibly is that now veterans of the Vietnam War veteran veterans are getting even older and they're entering into this particularly risky age bracket for suicide one of the reasons that the suicide rate nationally is going up could be caused by decreasing religiosity number of studies have found that religious people church-going people are significantly less suicidal Catholicism in particular appears to have a correlation with lower suicide rates that this may have to do with its stance on divorce being a happy marriage or really any marriage is a good predictor of not committing suicide there are also obviously moral foundations teleological visions to religion that will play into this as well an idea that there's a purpose there's a reason for me to be here suffering isn't the end of the world most people and most of the history of the world have suffered and that suffering can be sanctifying and it can be for a purpose and it can be and it can even be good it can be refining suffering itself has no moral value to it it's only your reaction to suffering that has a moral value so if you react to suffering with courage and dignity and perseverance and transcendence and you know kissing it up to God that's a that's a wonderful reaction to suffering and if you react to it with self-pity and with self-destruction that's a morally bad reaction to it the most important thing here from a policy level is to make sure that veterans and the American people have easy access to mental health services the cultural vision is that we need to make sure we don't can persist in a nihilistic culture and from your personal experience make sure you're getting the help that you can there are a ton of resources out there for you and many of them are free make sure you do that and thank you for your service and I hope you get better from Benjamin hello Michael I love your show thank you I'm a recently retired lobbyist from the Kentucky legislature on Wednesday night Rep Dan Johnson committed suicide presumably in response to unproven allegations that he molested a teenager in quotes in reading the police report information who did not press charges because of lack of evidence beyond the he-said she-said what is alleged to have happened is that representative Johnson had too much to drink and he ended up fondling a 17 year old girl against her will of course there are no distinctions drawn here in our media between the difference between a teenager can rage a few days / 12 - a few days shy of 18 I think one important thing that moral thought leaders need to do more of is to speak of the sins of calumny and detraction how many among us could withstand in the public sphere a scrutiny and expose of our personal lives whatever the facts of this case it's my opinion that Dan's wife is right this was a high-tech lynching of her husband why do so many people think it is morally licit to spread true information about others to destroy their character thank you Mike and Louisville this is a really tough one I I did run this story I talked about this a little bit I think last week two weeks ago this is really sad story all around but especially in this climate where we're comparing a guy who gets a little drunk and a little handsy but no more than that with a guy like Harvey Weinstein who's a serial rapist a couple thoughts on this one if you run for office I've worked on a lot of political campaigns if you run for office you have to assume that people will do these sorts of things to you you have to make sure that you have the stability and a thick enough skin to withstand the worst sorts of lives or even worse the worst sorts of truths that are being spread about you on campaigns that I've worked on there have been people on both sides of the campaign our opponents and on our campaigns whose job it is to find dirt and oppo and ruin a guy's life so that he loses the election now there's a rule that I've always tried to to keep in my mind on campaigns if we've if we ever find anything truly truly awful you I think you should always bring it to the other campaign I don't mean awful like it's gonna kill his campaign or even his career I mean awful like it's gonna ruin this guy's life in his marriage you should bring it to the other campaign first and say you've got 24 hours to get out of the race or we are going to release this if they don't comply it's all fair game politics is a very very messy dirty business unfortunately it often attracts mentally unstable people of people who don't have a terribly thick skin and it can result in these awful things but you got to be aware of that it's easy on campaigns to get carried away and say oh yeah we got this dirt we're gonna win this race but politics isn't everything and you're gonna have to answer what you do someday so make sure even when you're brawling you're bloody your tough in politics which is every single campaign make sure that you're not compromising your moral soul make sure that you're playing at least in a way where you could look at yourself in the mirror I was a really sad story all around and probably it was a combination of representative Johnson not having the understanding of what politics how dirty it can get how awful it's gonna be not maybe having that really bone thick skin and also a reach on the other side that was just a really vicious vicious attack and they're gonna have to answer for that too next question from Seamus hi Michael do you think it's appropriate for secularists atheists and other non-christians to celebrate Christmas absolutely absolutely I was talking to Matt Walsh about this yesterday Matt I think thinks if you don't belong to a Benedictine monastery and say 20 novenas a day you shouldn't celebrate Christmas maybe I'm exaggerating a little I don't think that Andrew Clavin is a great example on this if you read his book which is very very good the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ if you read his book he converted to Christianity around age 50 and one of the seeds for that conversion which was born out of literature and born out of understanding narrative in the world and coming to Christ through that he was basically converted by a Christmas cookie when he was a little kid he loved Christmas celebrations he loved going over to a family friend's house and seeing the decorations and participating in that that could have a wonderful effect Christmas is the the Incarnation Christ comes he's conceived of the Holy Spirit born of the Virgin Mary he becomes man excuse me the divine logos of the universe in that moment one of the first stories we see in the infancy narratives are these three wise men and they come from the east they come from the land of the sunrise and they're not Jews they are probably Zoroastrians Eastern priests and the word magic and magician comes from Magi and but they there's a talk in the town there's talk in the air that the king of the world will be born in Judea and so they walk and they walk through and they're they're led by the star to Christ that is always important in our world Christ comes into the world so that all of the nations will come and worship Him and and we don't have to make people insist on people doing it on our terms Herod didn't say you have to become Jews before you can go see Christ you know and what he really said was tell me where he is so I can go kill him and they went they left by another way they came to Christ by one way and those Magi left by another way physically and metaphysically so on the physical side they didn't want to tell Herod where he was and have to get killed on the metaphysical side they changed their minds and a lot of things can change your mind a lot of things can bring you to Christ that you wouldn't expect it's not within your rational ability to limit what can bring you to Christ so absolutely everybody should break at the Santa Claus and the reindeers and the snowmen and frosty and Rudolph whatever just bring them along Christmas is a gateway drug to two metaphysical truth and the divine logos of the universe and it's very fun and enjoyable so do it from coal hello Michael I very much enjoy the show and like the beautiful women you often bring on for the panel of deplorable so you're telling me buddy keep up the great work thank you my question big shock regards the Catholic faith I never get any of those that's so strange okay I must admit I've been drawn to it recently but I can't help but feel the Pope is misrepresenting the faith I think you mean to say he seems more interested in spitting out left-wing propaganda rather than representing Christ is a Catholic are you able to think critically of your leaders or does this get you in trouble with the church I'd hate to put you on the spot light with your faith but the current Pope for some reason has made me question becoming a Catholic could you please help me thanks you should become a Catholic anyway don't don't worry about that Oh over time a lot of misconceptions have come out of the Catholic Church so one is that the Pope is totally infallible and whatever he says goes and if he says the sky is purple then the sky's not gonna be blue that's gonna be purple whatever if he says two plus two equals seven then that becomes the truth but that isn't the case the Pope is infallible in a very limited number of things we've had good Pope's and we've had bad popes the church lady is encouraged to think critically and to think for themselves Dante the Divine poet one of the most important figures who offers one of the most beautiful visions of eternity Dante put a couple Pope's in Hell so he you put them there himself that that isn't the worst thing in the world an important aspect here is to think about the difference between the mainstream media portraying Pope Francis and Pope Francis himself so I'm not willing to compare Pope Francis with the various pontiff's who have gone to hell because what we read in the media is so often not true they don't understand anything about the Catholic faith so they don't understand anything about what he is saying people would have you the mainstream media would have you think that Pope Francis is going to get gay-married next week and and paint the Vatican and rainbows but Pope Francis said when he was Cardinal Norton Tina he said do not be mistaken same-sex marriage is not a mere political lobby it's a machination of the father of lies that seeks to deceive and confuse the children of God that does not jibe with the image that we are presented with by Newsweek of Pope Francis but that said Pope Francis has said some things that are a little strange that we might not all agree with recently a group of conservative Catholics and theologians presented him with a filial correction for heresy they formally accused him of heresy in a very nice and polite and orderly way if you find yourself being drawn to the church universal as I have been in my life I would keep pursuing that and I wouldn't let one cleric that you don't particularly care for it dissuade you it's been around for 2,000 years and there have been some clerics that you won't agree with and some orders that you won't agree with you know very often conservatives make fun of the Jesuits because they lean left and they get their little clever you know so someone was asked the difference between the Dominican Order and the Jesuit Order and they said well what are the similarities I said well you know both were formed in Spain one by Saint Dominic one by Ignatius of Loyola and both were founded to combat heresy so the Dominicans were formed to combat the Alba Jenson's and the Jesuits were formed to fight the Protestants so guy says well what's the difference between the Dominicans and the Jesuits and the answer is have you met any Alba Jenson's lately we mock Jesuits all the time that's okay you can feel free to veer into very conservative aspects of the church but come on over if you're interested the water is great Bal and I hope that answers your question from Christian dear Knowles can you prove the Gospels really are authentic and why don't the why the Jews don't see it that way well I don't I don't know that the Jews writ large questioned the historicity of the Gospels certainly they don't believe in the divinity of Christ by definition I suppose but the scholarly consensus is clear the scholarly consensus right now is that the Gospel according to mark was written within 40 years of Jesus's death Matthew within 40 to 70 years Luke within 30 to 60 years John within 50 to 65 years that's on the outside end so think about it this way would you trust a biography today that was written about Andy Kaufman Andy Kaufman was about 35 years old when he died he died about 33 years ago would you trust that or would you say no that's absolutely ridiculous how could they know about Andy Kaufman oh there are people alive who knew him and we have movies and we have books about him historians all certainly also agree that about jesus' baptism by John the Baptist and his death by Pontius Pilate they all agree that those occurred they might disagree about some of the miracles Flavius Josephus the Roman historian writes about Christ and his followers Tacitus the Talmud writes about Christ it I think it's very fashionable now to question the historicity of Christ or to question the Gospel accounts we know more about him than we know about virtually anyone else of that era we know we and we can rely on more than that so when you engage with the text on that level but you should just read it you should read these accounts and encounter this person and then you'll have to grapple with Christ Himself you'll have to grapple with the person of Christ and CS Lewis writes about this when you meet him you have three options he's either a liar he's either just deceiving people going around deceiving everybody or he's a lunatic and he's seen he's just a total crazy person or he's the Lord or he's the person he says he is and I'll tell you when you read those books he sure doesn't come off as a liar he has no incentive to be a liar and he doesn't get great rewards for his lies that's certainly true infinite torture on a cross and he doesn't seem a lunatic he does not sound like a lunatic when you read him and you read his piercing words and his and his piercing actions so it's hard not to conclude the latter but your mileage might vary you should read it yourself from Stephanie hi Michael can you give me a reference for the Pascal quote you mentioned on Tuesday aside from it being somewhere in the ponse or in the thoughts of best gal it was something to the effect of being a gentleman instead of being known for what one writes yes Pascal is one of the incredible genius of modernity most people know him by Pascal's wager so his wager is you should believe in Christianity because if you're wrong you lose nothing and or if you're wrong you'll burn in hell for eternity and if you're right you lose you know you gain all of infinity so unfortunately he died at age 39 he invented the calculator who's a mathematician who's a physicist child prodigy and a Catholic theologian he wrote in his thoughts which are just a notes he was putting together for a book that he didn't live long enough to write he said man is full of wants he only loves those who satisfy them all he's a good mathematician say they but I have nothing to do with mathematics he would take me for a proposition he is a good soldier he will take me for a besieged place what I wanted is a gentleman who can adapt himself to all my wants in a general way we should not be able to say either that he is a mathematician a preacher or an orator but that he's a gentleman this quality of universality is the only one that pleases me and it's especially important in our day where everyone specializes even professors nobody is a professor of literature anymore nobody's a professor of history anymore they're professors of the Gender Studies read through Derrida from 1967 to 1967 and a half the specialization is so so intense that you don't have people who have more qualities who are known by more than just their job who are known by more than just where they live or their friends the quality of being a gentleman is really something that we could look back to and I think it would balance out a lot of the anxiety that people feel today from Betsy hi Michael I've often heard you discuss your own path from being basically atheist when you were confirmed to finding God again through evangelists and then finally landing back firmly in Catholicism my nephew is preparing to be confirmed Catholic this spring and my sister his mom has told me that he's an atheist and she has to drag him to church he is an extremely intelligent kid and unfortunately his high intelligence translates to a know-it-all cynicism he's 14 yeah I hear about that can you offer any tips for how to make him turn back toward God and in particular our Catholic faith should he speak to someone who's going through a similar journey a priest I worry about her slightly out of touch not great with kids Monsignor turning him further from the faith I think of having him read CS Lewis he's an avid reader but you know I wonder if one can force a kid to read something that he doesn't want to read any help would be appreciated okay yes I will take this on I experienced this myself it's very very fitting that you're highly intelligent 14 year-old nephew is an atheist atheism is tailor-made for people who have the wisdom and the ignorance of and the arrogance of smart 14-year olds that is the key demographic it makes perfect sense when you're a smart 14 year old you question everything you're taught but you're not unfortunately or 14 so you're not smart enough you don't have any experience or any maturity or any deepened understanding of the world or even any education so you can't get past that hurdle it bill Whittle talks about that island 120 he said sort of the dumbest people are conservatives and the middle tier are liberals and then the smart people are conservatives again and that kind of middle tier is the New York Times editorial board this exactly happened to me I was a smarter than average 13 14 year old so when I was about to be confirmed I was an atheist I said I was an atheist and my mother said Michael just do it go through the confirmation I think you're going through a phase you will regret it if you don't go through the with this later on so I said okay and she was right smarter than average 14-year old I read all of those atheists Christopher Hitchens and short Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett and all of them Sam Harris later when I was when I was 17 years old a couple days before Christmas excuse me I get a little choked up with this my mother died very unexpectedly and that is an experience that matures somebody and it's a very humbling experience the experience of death close up especially if you're young or whatever the experience of the traumas that we all face in our lives deepen your understanding of the world and they humble you and you realize oh maybe I don't have all the answers maybe I don't have control over everything in the world during Advent the church spends four Sunday's analyzing for mysteries of life death judgment heaven and hell these are mysteries that we don't think about all of the time we don't think about them every day or every year even every 10 years but they do confront us eventually and when we can when we grapple with these things we can be led up through into some maturity you need that humility first which 14 year olds are constitutionally incapable of then you need some education and as I was educated I came to meet people who were smarter than me who made very good arguments for Christianity modern apologists ancient apologists the arguments for God are much better than the arguments against God I haven't really heard any coherent arguments against God once you reach that point and you've got some humility and some maturity and some education just a just even a little bit of any of those can you reach that point again I think and then after that I believe that Christianity was true and only after that did I have any real what would be called religious sense a recognition or numinous recognition that's probably not the answer you want the answer you want is probably not wait ten years wait for the kid to experience some of the more difficult parts of life and get a little learning in his head but I wouldn't push him do not push him you're just gonna push him further into his 14 year old atheist delusions don't drag him to church I didn't go to church for 10 years probably you don't have to do that be a little patient there's a time for every purpose under heaven just try to guide him a little bit in to make sure he doesn't go off the wrong path he gets a little humility he gets a little maturity and and he will come back especially if he's a smart kid all right that's like that's a
