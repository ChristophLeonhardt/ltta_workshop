I am Max Keiser this is the Kaiser II part you know we talk a lot of various topics on this show and one topic that we don't talk enough about is love you know love makes the world go round without love nothing is possible I'm so fortunate to be so in love with Stacy okay well that's quite interesting that you bring that up because actually our first topic is all about hate and how hate drives huge profit hate and fear and it's all about the American huckster so you know that the right-wing in America the Republican base has was kind of you know rallied into a passionate fervor with a tea party once Obama won and it was all about like irrational fear of Obama who was supposedly born in Kenya as a Muslim and was a secret Muslim taking over the United States and was going to introduce Sharia law sort of crazy well now the left-wing has gone this the so-called left wing has done the same thing we've turned into you know the Democrats have turned into another American huckster class so I'm gonna read you this headline from The Daily Beast about you know the resistance the hashtag the resistance and all of the groups the the you know the the political action committees that have erupted around fighting Donald Trump and saving the Republic from the New World Order of Donald Trump cash for coalition against Trump going into consultants pockets instead as Trump ran for president the group Democratic coalition against Trump raised money promising to stop him while dedicating more than 90% of its expenditures to paying its own members this is around a guy on Twitter called Scott Dworkin he's got a huge following now because he's leading the resistance along with Louise mention Eric garland and all these crazy wacky conspiracy theorist send us your five bucks right now and we'll fight Trump on your behalf I'm convinced the connection with hate and hucksterism is one where the hucksters in this case are instilling hate hate the other side the two minutes of hate they're trying to get people to hate irrationally toward the Republicans coming from the resistance side of the equation they're they're not instilling hate the hate is already there and they're like you know they're tickling that hate they're they themselves have no emotion they're just like looking for somebody to plunder to pick their pockets and you send us five bucks the snake-oil here will help you get rid of your you know shaky legs and it works every a hundred percent of the time here they're like just send us your five bucks and we'll help defeat Trump will help keep you from you know you know will will will will will seek vengeance for Hillary it was her turn she should have had it hucksterism I guess is the right term for it I mean this is the basis of the American experience it goes back to PT Barnum it goes back to Wild Bill Hickok it's part it's Thomas Edison it's it's Elon Musk is at the end of the day a bit of a huckster there's a spectrum upon which hucksterism is a you know some of them actually get Steve Jobs these are freakin hucksters they happen to be able to sweet-talk their way into Wall Street raise a few billion dollars introduced technologies that became world-beating but without that make it and fake it to make it mentality that is so American there would be no thing that's what Donald Trump represents so these people don't understand what they're fighting they're fighting Ben Franklin they're fighting the Constitution they're fighting the revolution of 1776 they're fighting Alex Jones for gosh sakes and nobody beats Alex Jones he's got to pee everyone's become Alex Jones 20 years ago Alex Jones was the fringe guy in media now there's no more Walter Cronkite there's no more mainstream media anchor person who's and or even Brian Williams the last of the tribe was obliterated now we've got Rachel Maddow and everyone in mainstream media Katie Couric Oh whomever they're all trying to catch up to Alex Jones Alex Jones is the gold standard in American news and the crazier the conspiracy theories from Maddow becomes the more she sells now on Alex Jones is colloidal silver and garden and the can sort of stuff but on her show it's just as wacky sort of opioids and viagra and and you know erectile dysfunction shown that that goop which is the product of that shiksa oh gosh I didn't know sorry but she's got goop which is the same stuff in it that they sell over at Infowars an erectile dysfunction gosh you know if only they just were able to cure baldness like they were trying to do originally I mean then we wouldn't need Edie would we because we're just too good-looking I saw a horrible video of Donald Trump apparently he's like completely ball and has these weird patches all over his head whoever does the Greens that his golf courses did his hair do you know they brought in some kind of greens keeper to come up with that air do I mean if you get lost in there with your three iron it's a two-stroke penalty but it makes no sense for the president any nice taste to look like that as kind of an outsider to these two groups of hucksters of victims of hucksters right wing left wing Red Team Blue team you know Democrat Republican because we've lived outside the US for so long and then it's quite funny too we were mocking the Tea Party and and that they were being plundered by all sorts of hucksters and now it's it's funny to watch the left-wing so the left-wing the people who howl at the sky and the people who are like having breakdowns over you know to hucksters running against each other there were two various forms of hucksters Trump versus Clinton they're both hucksters one huckster perhaps he's a bigger huckster but nevertheless he still won the most votes are the most electoral college votes for sure Hillary is not a huckster Bill Clinton is a huckster Hillary is like Leona Helmsley said she's a word that rhymes with rich I think that was her direct quote but that doesn't make her a huckster unfortunately as she would have won while she was riding on the coattails of a huckster and here again they talked about the Democratic coalition Scott to work and they paid more than half of the money it raised last year to its employees they're consulting firms according to the Federal Election Commission records Dworkin's Bulldog finance group was the chief beneficiary drawing more than a hundred thousand dollars from the Democratic coalition the breakdown in 2016 when the Democratic coalition declared his goal was quote making sure that Donald Trump never became president was even starker that year Dworkin and other staff members received more than 90% of all the Democratic coalition's expenditures either personally or through a consulting company according to FEC records it's a common theme throughout US literature poetry culture a yellow tabloid journalism through history I did a research on that actually came over with the Chinese immigrants who are building the railway and they had actual Chinese oils snake oils that were good for arthritis or muscle pains of things like this and then the American huckster was able to adapt that and be American eyes it so that they just used opium alcohol and some other fancy ingredients cocaine in a bottle and sold that as a pain reliever and it's still going on today the biggest opiate crisis in American history is just a snake oil repackaged from the days of the Chinese immigrants selling snake oil on the plains across America so it's never been without us it's never changed we've never not had this plague of hucksterism and that's what America is all about Donald Trump is as American as the flag and apple pie again here's some more recent quotes from The Daily Beast article the apparent self dealing in large legal expenditures of the Democratic coalition against Trump have left some donors to the organization angry with what they see as a waste of money and energy it's also left Democratic operatives worried that money is being sent to organizations that are engaged largely in self-promotion at a time when resources are needed from midterm election contests and sustained advocacy against Trump hucksterism flourishes and the political arena when we are no longer really citizens we're consumers we want to buy somebody who will do our work for us I do our advocacy get out there with our placards go out there and vote go out there and agitate and go out there and harass you know not harass but like you know be a citizen and call your Congress people call your local officials call the party and say do this or do that and said we want to just like just like with charity which is also filled with hucksterism you send bob geldof 10 bucks or you know one of those sort of organizations headed by a celebrity front person you know you send them money and you think like now I feel better and I'm just gonna go you know plunder resources around the world with a feeling a little bit better that my military plunders their resources but at least I gave $20 to some charity that allegedly helps some people who are start well you know the child laborers at a diamond mind and in in somewhere in Africa George Washington didn't chop down a cherry tree is right Bill Clinton and they get away with it because America loves it America loves the huckster and you know that's what got us to the moon I'm sure if we went up back up to the moon we'd find that all that equipment up there was made by somebody other than they said it was going to made they weren't drinking tang and you know it was just all a way to get over on some date somewhere on planet Earth it's all about getting out it's Hugh Hefner ISM writ large you'll go to the moon to beat you know I'm saying shades of hucksterism everybody's a huckster and this sort of economy certainly in a consumer capitalist society and crony capitalist society you got to be a huckster you always got to be selling and you got to sell somebody and then like you have to flip your house to some chump faster than they could understand that you understand why people don't like Trump I mean they dislike self-hating Americans like don't they realize that they that's who they are they think Americans think if they are but Barack Obama they think they're you know Marvin Gaye you know out there smooth as silk just smoothing it and being like yeah go daddy did he go daddy yeah man we've got it all we'd work in it and it's that's who we are we're American we're smooth you know but that's not us Americans are crude ruthless huckster golf-playing sharks that's who we are and that's who Donald Trump is that's why I didn't like a Barack Obama that's why they love Trump so again most people don't don't to look at themselves as victims especially when a huckster is doing you over or ponzi-scheme operator defrauded you you don't nobody likes to admit that so you can look at the other side and you can see how there haha look at those Tea Party scam they've been scammed by all the hucksters so let's look at the other side because the Democrats of course are pristine and smart and way to a lead and educated and ivory towers and arugula eating but they mentioned here that we saw the rise a scam PACs during the Obama years where grifters would tap into anti-obama sentiment to raise mostly small dollar donations from grassroots conservatives in them pay themselves consulting fees rather than use the money to support candidates or causes Brendan Fischer the director federal and FEC reform programs at the nonprofit campaign Legal Center said in an email the Democratic coalition seems to be using a similar playbook only here they are tapping into anti-trump sentiment but I'm sure like you are so smart and you're on NBC and MSNBC and you're way smarter than to be conned by these hucksters there's another word for those CNBC types and the Rachel Maddow types MSNBC and that's communist clearly they're a communist threat there's a communist infestation in this country last back to the original one another American huckster Joe McCarthy that's right you know I was just watching some videos some Paul Robson that guy was down I mean he set the stage for everything you know he he stuck it to YT in a very elegant way with that voice genius everyone should watch Paul ropes and get an education hey we got to go to the second half stay right there and don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to continue our conversation with Marc usko he runs Morgan Creek capital right here in North Carolina it's like billion dollars and stuff welcome back Marc thanks for having me first of all two quick points carry over from our last chat here why is the Bitcoin gold equivalency it's a very dashing tie and second of all you put out a four hundred thousand dollar price target for Bitcoin because you believe it is gold 2.0 if I'm not mistaken just to finish that point mark digital gold I think it's the preferred method for storing value for the Millennial Generation I think if you ask anybody under the age of 30 if they own gold they look at you like you have 2 heads if you ask me if they own Bitcoin or aetherium oh my gosh of course so if you think about gold as a market it's an eight point four trillion dollar market they're 21 million bitcoins out there aren't they're 18 or 19 whatever the number is but 84 8.4 divided by 21 is 400 thousand that's over a decade not tomorrow and what's the compounded rate of return on that it's a big number I need to do that yes that's a good one but yeah I mean we'll get to the warren buffett bed a second now Yogi Berra said you can observe a lot just by watching even watching the Dow Jones soar for the past year what have you observed I have observed that we are in the euphoria stage of a bubble that we are in the melt up phase of that euphoria stage which means we're getting very close to the end and you can never predict the end date you know great economist once said tell people when or what never together so I won't do that but I think that I have observed we're highly valued in traditional stocks and bonds around the world and it's time to look at alternative assets and crypto currencies and other things are alternative assets Morgan Creek are you obligated to be fully invested or can you take a heavy cash position how do you play this really important question we are not obligated in the sense that you know we do have flexibility to to go to cash I would say even amongst our clients who are very sophisticated and who are who are great any of them still feel a little weird when we say hey go to cash you know one of my heroes in the investment business Seth Klarman today is 45 percent cash just like he wasn't no seven just like he was in 2000 to go back to 2000 they thought the guy had lost his touch right he didn't know what he was doing he was a value investor value was dead couldn't raise any money over the next decade SP was negative 1.9 percent he was up 17 percent compounded I think we're close to another decade like that coming up talk about alleges in the business Bill Miller yes one of the guys to beat the Dow for long a long time many years having 12 years in a row he recently took a huge Bitcoin position well he started small it became large when it went up a lot last year about tenfold JP Morgan has come out and said finally that we actually kind of like Bitcoin despite what our guy Jamie Dimon says it's a non correlated asset yes now why is that important marked non correlative assets reduce the risk in a portfolio one of the things about wealth right is all great wealth comes from concentration every great pool of wealth came from somebody being concentrated business ownership stock position real estate position all great wealth is preserved through diversification you know they say how do you create a small fortune start with a large one and stay concentrated so what non correlative asset does is it lowers the risk and look Markowitz won the Nobel Prize for this when you take bonds and you add stocks risk goes down add hedge funds risk goes down adventure capital risk goes down add Bitcoin risk goes down not up because it moves counter-cyclical II that's a really good important point that actually adding this to a portfolio reduces the risk because you're diversifying in a non-correlated asset and this point will be writ large amongst the many thousands of hedge funds out there they've got a huge buying power huge and they're gonna be coming in here stumbling around on a market that doesn't have a lot of volume for those guys and the something's got to give and that something is the price right the price has got to go up you know the hot lers aren't gonna stay feel bad make it making it so easy making this money go for hundred thousand dollars now I did the math quickly in my head while we're sitting here the car founded rate of return we're talking about is 1% a day I like that number yeah you know what I'm actually just made that up it's not that far off and here's the funny thing so on Twitter I'm out actually on Twitter to it at mark usko and I take a lot of grief because people say well how much you putting of your client money in this I said look we've told clients all along 1% in national cryptocurrency is another 1 to 3% in the picks and shovels you know the coin basis etc and then a what you think it's going to go up so much why not more said well because there's still a nonzero risk I think it's a very low but a nonzero risk that it could get displaced by a better technology I don't think that's going to happen I think the miracle of Bitcoin was going from point 6 cents $200 the fact that that happened was the miracle a hundred to a thousand not a miracle thousand to ten thousand not a miracle ten thousand to a hundred thousand not a miracle so but it's still not zero that something could come in now open source makes that better the risk is lower because if something great comes out we can take copy-paste that new technology on to the Bitcoin blockchain so I do think that over time I'll get more confidence to have a bigger position but like anything in life you start small when things go your way you double up that was one of the things that julian robertson one of my mentors great hedge fund manager was amazing at said you never average down losers average losers you always double things go up tend to go up because it go down tend to go down exactly now you've got a billion or so under management sounds like a lot but actually in the grand scheme of things that's not a lot really no are you the top dude over there is that your hope I am you've got maneuverability yeah so you can move around whereas large pension funds large institutions they have a board they have a committee Bitcoin won't be on you know their radar for a year or two or three years right look it's a great great point and we're talking to a multi you know tens of billions of dollar pension funds I'm getting your clients now who is good I'm gonna go through this guy said then what the guy did to go to what we would like to be is that that in between that allows an institution to get access and we're talking to this pension fund and they would love to get involved but they can't write smaller than one hundred million dollar check what's the chatter out there in that and the pension fund business you know that's kind of the their load in this industry what's the chatter they know that they want uncorrelated assets you were talking about earlier that's one of the benefits that's why JP Morgan put up the Bible of crypto currencies this morning because they want a piece of that business they want pieces of business no matter what Jamie says the fact is that shareholders want profits of course so Jamie is just talking nonsense pension funds have a problem if you look at everybody's forecasts of traditional assets over the next decade or the PAQ our research affiliates or GMO even Vanguard is telling us you're going to make low single digits your actuary soon great is seven so you're not going to get there so you've gotta find these uncoil assets whether be private investments to give you an illiquid premium real estate venture capital etc or something like crypto currencies Bitcoin a theory miss cetera where you're going to get this lift from the network effect that's such an incredible pitch to say that interest rates have been artificially low for years and years due to the bailouts that are ongoing for the banking sector your pension returns we thought they'd be 7% but they're actually 1% and to save the day to save America it's going to be Bitcoin I mean who would have thought that this was going to be the scenario now let's talk about the VIX the VIX is the volatility index and what happened with The Associated ETF products recently regarding these products your thoughts look short selling not that bad leverage not that bad leverage plus short selling can be bad and so what we had here was everybody and their sister started selling volatility because it was a one-way bet in a QE world selling volatility seemed risk list last year the S&P had its highest Sharpe ratio in history but a lot of history more ratio is the ratio of return to risk the standard deviation the return divided by standard deviation minus the risk-free rate the standard deviation last year was the lowest ever at 3.8 percent the Sharpe ratio was 4.5 the normal Sharpe ratio is 0.5 so nine times less volatile so it was only a matter of time before volatility spiked and when volatility spikes and your levered short you can lose everything which we saw in action reminds me of the naked puts that were being written in 1987 yes some of us are old enough to remember it's frightening stat more than half of hedge fund managers are less than five years in business well I think so they don't remember 87 and they don't remember 2000 but if you think about portfolio insurance and what it did it was a pro cyclical strategy right it does more of what's working and what that ensures it's like passive index funds what does that ensure it means you'll have the maximum exposure to exactly the wrong thing when the turn happens and that's exactly what happened in VIX all right let's talk about Warren Buffett here so in October you accepted $1,000,000 bet with Warren Buffett you said hedge funds will outperform the sp500 over the next ten years why do you think you'll win this time when others have lost well look the last 10-year bet that he made with Ted sadie's was was a really interesting bet and for the first five and a half years Buffett was behind and was only when QE started that the S&P had this low volatility melt up and hedge funds underperform that sounds like a dog ate my homework no I mean Buffett is Buffett and he knows that over a cycle like 10 years time the Fed is always going to come in and print money because their constituencies are the banks and they he is inside the banks he was the chairman of Salomon for years he like bailed out goldman sachs his dad was a stockbroker he's an insider he's not gonna make us a trivial bet like this I completely agree with you so why are you a glutton for punishment no because valuations are so extreme today that we'll win now the addendum to the story is I did talk to him I did think he was going to take the bet three days later he sent me a letter saying his age precluded him from taking the bet so my guess is he's never gonna take a bet he can't win he chickened out Warren you are a big fat ok plucky clucky my chicken my pet chicken because I don't go man to talk about this all right well that's the status of so let's talk about the bond market now we've been in a bull market you know since I started on Wall Street back in the early 80s yeah yeah the bond markets have just gone up 37 30 five years 35 years oh is it ever gonna end yeah perfect I was just listening on the ride over here to Carroll Sokoloff and if you've ever talked to him but you should he's run something called 13d research and he wrote a book in 1980 to inflation sending are you ready now think about 1982 where inflation was 13% nobody thought inflation was going to end everybody was buying equities not bonds and they should have bought bonds and just held him long bonds over the past 35 years have crushed equity returns compound returns much Harley just don't need to be long bonds the adoration there's beat the SP over the same time is that correct it is correct my guy and way Singh ttan yeah it runs a fund in Austin Texas that as track we're gonna prove it now the key is from here what he was saying is that he believes we've seen the secular low now the guys at van Hoisington would differ they think it's not to 2021 but we're getting close to that secular low and rates and at that point bond bear market is gonna take over and it's not going to be pretty I don't know before we had a bond sell-off yeah it was vicious yeah she's gotta eclipse that it would be way worse if it occurs I argue that it's going to be tough to occur because just like Japan we have a demographic problem every day in this country 10,000 people turn 65 65 to 85 year old people it turns out don't spend a lot they don't buy a lot and they buy bonds so I think there's going to be more of a bid for bonds than people anticipate because of the graying and that goes back to one of our you know conversation about health Ames all right we got to go thanks ray on the show no thanks for having me was fun of course it's fun the best show ever CNBC stinks this is the show anyway we got to go thanks for being here and watching the Kaiser report with me Max Keiser Stacy Herbert special guest was Mark usko he's over there at Morgan Creek Capitol there fantastic exposure to Bitcoin if you're the middle tier you know not the trying to catch us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye
