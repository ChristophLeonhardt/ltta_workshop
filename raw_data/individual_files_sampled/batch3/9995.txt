AMERICA WILL ALWAYS CHOOSE COOPERATION AND INDEPENDENT OVER GLOBAL GOVERNORS CONTROL AND REGULATION. WE CANNOT ALLOW A RERAH JET STREAM WHO CHANTS DEATH TO AMERICA TO POSSESS THE MEANS TO DELIVER A NUCLEAR WAR HEAD. CHINA'S MARKET DISTORTIONS AND THE WAY THEY DEAL CANNOT BE TOLERATE YOU HAD. MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN ALMOST ANY ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AMERICA'S SO TRUE. DIDN'T EXPECT THAT REACTION BUT THAT'S OKAY. BRIAN: PRESIDENT IN THE MOMENT. AINSLEY: LET'S BRING IN NIKKI HALEY SHE WAS THE GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK. STEVE: SOUTH CAROLINA. AINSLEY: I LOVED SHE IS IN NEW YORK NOW. AINSLEY: I LIVED IN TWO STATES I LOVED THEM BOTH. I KNOW YOU WERE IN THE ROOM WHEN IT HAPPENED. SOMETIMES THE MEDIA CAN PORTRAY IT AS ONE THING AND IT WASN'T THAT AT ALL. WHAT WAS IT LIKE. THE MEDIA HAS GOT THIS SO WRONG. I DEAL WITH THESE LEADERS EVERY SINGLE DAY. I KNOW EXACTLY HOW THEY THINK. DO THEY LOVE AMERICA? NO. DO THEY RESPECT AMERICA? NOW THEY DO. WHEN THEY SAID THAT THEY LOVE HOW HONEST HE IS. AND IT'S NOT DIPLOMATIC. AND THEY FIND IT FUNNY. I MEAN, WHEN HE GOES AND HE IS VERY TRUTHFUL THEY KIND OF WERE TAKEN BACK BY IT. THEY ARE NOT USED TO IT. ALL DAY YESTERDAY THEY WERE FALLING OVER THEMSELVES TO GET A PICTURE WITH HIM TO TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT HIS SPEECH WAS. HOW STRONG IT WAS. WHETHER HE SAID GOOD THINGS ABOUT THEM OR NOT THEY LOVE THAT HE IS HONEST WITH THEM. AND THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN LIKE IT. SO THERE IS A RESPECT THERE. I SAW THAT THE MEDIA WAS TRYING TO MAKE IT SOMETHING DISRESPECTFUL. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS. THEY LOVE TO BE WITH HIM. THAT'S THE ONLY TIME YOU WILL SEE THAT ENTIRE CHAMBER STANDING ROOM ONLY. BRIAN: IT WAS THE ECHO LAUGH. FOR EXAMPLE, A PART OF IT WAS HE PULLED OFF THE PROMPTER AND REACTED IN REALTIME AND NEVER HAPPENED AT THE U.N. STEVE: AD-LIB. BRIAN: WORLD IS WATCHING AD-LIB IT. THAT MADE THEM LOVE HIM ANYMORE. BRIAN: YOU DEAL WITH THIS EVERY DAY. AXIOS WHO TENDS TO BE FAIR. THEIR LEAD STORY HUG THE THUG FLIP OF OYOUR FRIEND'S WORLD VIEW. THAT'S HOW THEY VIEWED THE SPEECH WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THAT. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT. HE IS ALWAYS TALKING TO HIS AUDIENCE. WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT KIM, HE WAS TALKING TO KIM. HE WAS SITTING THERE SAYING THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP TO BE HAD. THERE ARE THINGS TO BE DONE. WHEN HE IS TALKING ABOUT OPEC AND THE ISSUES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN, IS HE TALKING TO THE SAUDIS SAYING RELEASE MORE OIL, WE HAVE GOT TO GET THESE GAS PRICES DOWN. IS HE VERY GOOD AT KNOWING HIS AUDIENCE AND HE IS TALKING STRAIGHT TO PERSON OR COUNTRY IS HE TRYING TO GET A MESSAGE TOO. STEVE: TALKING ABOUT HOW TRADE DEALS WITH THE UNITED STATES HAVE GOT TO BE FAIR ARECIPROCAL, IS HE TALKING TO CHINA. IS HE TALKING TO CANADA. IS HE TALKING TO WHOM? HE IS TALKING TO MEXICO. IS HE TALKING TO INDIA. HE IS TALKING HE JUST FINISHED WITH SOUTH KOREA, WITH JAPAN. WHAT HE IS DOING IS SAYING I'M NOT GOING TO SIT THERE AND TALK ABOUT THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. WE'RE GOING TO DO DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS. HE JUST DID A GREAT ONE WITH SOUTH KOREA. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HE DID ONE WITH MEXICO. HE IS REDOING ALL OF THESE NEGOTIATION. SO, FOR THE FIRST TIME, AMERICANS AROUND THE SUFFERING. IT'S FAIR FOR AMERICA. AND THE COUNTRIES KNOW THAT IT'S UNFAIR. THEY KNOW IT HAS TO CHANGE. THEY DON'T LIKE IT. BUT THEY KNOW HE IS RIGHT. AINSLEY: THE PRESIDENT HAD A MESSAGE FOR IRAN. YOU HAD A MESSAGE FOR IRAN. SO DID MIKE POMPEO AND JOHN BOLTON. JOHN BOLTON SAYING THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY IF IRAN CONTINUES AGGRESSION. YOU SAID IF EUROPEAN ALLIES DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN THEY WILL FACE SANCTIONS. WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE NOW FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT ARE WORRIED ABOUT IRAN? THAT WE DO NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT IRAN HONESTLY IRAN IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. CAN YOU LOOK, WE ARE HAVING MULTIPLE ATTACKS FROM PROXIES ON EMBASSY IN IRAQ. VERY INVOLVED WHETHER IT'S LEBANON OR YEMEN. THEY ARE CONSTANTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF TROUBLE. THEY ARE NOT ON OUR SIDE. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY KNOWS TRYING TO DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN IS ONLY HELPING TERRORISTS. YOU ARE NOT HELPING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. BRIAN: AMBASSADOR IS IT TRUE THAT THE EUROPEANS ARE TRYING TO GIVE INCENTIVES FOR THE EU COMPANIES TO GO IRAN WHICH IS REALLY A THUMB IN OUR EYE. AND THESE COMPANIES ARE NOT RESPONDING BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT INVOLVED. IS THAT THE SCENARIO AS YOU SEE IT. THEY HAVE IT SO WRONG. HAVE YOU THE WOMAN WHO HELPED GET THIS DEAL TOGETHER. SHE IS TRYING TO HOLD A DEAL TOGETHER BECAUSE SHE DID IT SHE IS NOT LOOKING OUT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHO NUMBER ONE DON'T WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN. YOU CAN HAVE THAT PROOF BY THE FACT THAT COMPANIES ARE DROPPING DEALS WITH IRAN. THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO GET DEALS WITH IRAN. BECAUSE THEY GET WHO THEY ARE DEALING WITH. STEVE: SURE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY? BEEN SOME HAVE DEPICTED DEPIC BEEN SOME HAVE DEPICTED DEPIE IT SOUNDS LIKE HE HAS BEEN SOME HAVE DEPICTED DEPID IT AS MEDDLING. SOME SAY JUST WAIT THIS ADMINISTRATION OUT. THINGS WILL GET BETTER. WHAT SECRETARY KERRY DID WAS NOT ONLY DISRESPECTFUL. IT WAS HURTFUL TO AMERICA. WHEN WE ARE SITTING THERE TRYING TO GET IRAN TO COME TO THE TABLE IN A WAY THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTING HAS TO STOP. THE SUPPORT OF TERRORISM HAS TO STOP. THEY HAVE TO QUIT SELLING ARMS TO THE HOUTHIS, WHEN ALL THOSE THINGS TO HAVE ANOTHER AMERICAN GO IN AND SAY DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, THAT ABSOLUTELY IS ANTI-AMERICAN, AND IT WAS HURTFUL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND IF SECRETARY KERRY WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, HE WOULD NOT WANT ANYONE DOING THAT. BRIAN: HE SAYS DR. KISSINGER DOES THAT AND NO ONE EVER COMPLAINS. LET ME TELL YOU A HUGE FAN OF DR. KISSINGER AND VERY RESPECTED MAN BECAUSE HE NEVER GOES OUT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT TELLING OUR ADMINISTRATION WHEN HE COMES BACK HE TELLS OUR ADMINISTRATION. HE WORKS WITH US AND TELLS US WHAT HE IS DOING ALL THE TIME. AINSLEY: KERRY DOESN'T DO THAT. SECRETARY KERRY WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT CONVERSATION HAPPENED. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING. DR. KISSINGER YOU NEVER HAVE TO WORRY THAT HE IS NOT ON AMERICA'S SIDE. AINSLEY: AMBASSADOR YOU ARE SITTING NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT AT THE U.N., YOU WALKED IN WITH HIM, YOU INTRODUCED HIM. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THE CRITICISM ABOUT HIM AND WHAT'S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH HIM YOU? KNOW HIM ON A PERSONAL LEVEL? IT'S GOTTEN SO DISGUSTING, REALLY. I MEAN, THE IDEA THAT HE IS NOT MENTALLY FIT. THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE 25TH AMENDMENT. NONE OF THAT IS TRUE. IT COULDN'T BE FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH. YOU'VE GOT A PRESIDENT WHO IS NONSTOP GOING ALL THE TIME. THE CABINET IS JUST TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH HIM. IS HE GETTING THINGS DONE LEFT AND RIGHT. HOW CAN YOU HONESTLY THINK A MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE IS DOING IS GETTING THIS MUCH DONE ON JOBS, ON TRADE DEALS, ON FOREIGN POLICY, LOOK AT THE STOCK MARKET, I MEAN, AMERICANS ARE LIVING BETTER THAN THEY EVER HAVE AND YOU ARE GOING TO QUESTION HIS LEADERSHIP? STEVE: WHEN YOU WATCH THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA THOUGH, ACCORDING TO THE MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER, 90% OF THE COVERAGE OF DONALD TRUMP IS NEGATIVE. YET, YOU KNOW, HIS POPULARITY, HIS FAVORABILITY NUMBER HAS REMAINS STEADY OR HAS GONE UP A LITTLE BIT, WHICH IS A SHOCKING NUMBER, CONSIDERING ALL THE VAST AVALANCHE OF BAD PUBLICITY HE HAS GOTTEN. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS I LOOKED AT THE MEDIA YESTERDAY AND THEY ALL WANTS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD VIEW OF THE PRESIDENT IS. WHAT THEY NEED TO UNDERSTANDING IS THE WORLD DOESN'T UNDERSTANDING THE MEDIA IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW. LIKE THEY SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING, THAT IS WHAT MAKES US LOOK BAD IS WHEN THEY ARE CONSTANTLY I WAS TALKING TO A WORLD LEADER YESTERDAY, I WON'T NAME WHICH LEADER IT WAS, AND HE SAID I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD EVER TALK ABOUT IMPEACHMENT, 25TH AMENDMENT. HE SAID DO THEY UNDERSTANDING THIS IS AMERICA? YOU DON'T PLAY WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AINSLEY: SOUTH KOREA'S PRESIDENT HE WAS PRAISES HIM. IT WAS NOT THE SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT. LEADERS DON'T KNOW WHY THIS IS A CONVERSATION AND THEY FIND IT DANGEROUS FOR OUR COUNTRY. BRIAN: TALK ABOUT NORTH KOREA IN PARTICULAR, NOT JUST PERT THAN IT WAS A YEAR AGO. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING CLOSER TO DENUCLEARIZATION, CAN YOU? I THINK THAT WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YES, HUGE PROGRESS IN THE WAY THAT HASN'T HAD BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTING. LOOK AT THEIR 70TH PARADE. I REMEMBER A YEAR AND A HALF AGO LOOKING AT THOSE PARADES AND IT WAS NOTHING BUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS. NONE OF THAT THIS TIME. AND YOU HAVE GOT KIM ASKING FOR ANOTHER MEETING. AND YOU'VE GOT HIM STARTING TO SOCIALIZE WITH THE REGION AND TRYING TO FIND PEACE. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY. WE HAVE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT TO GET HIS CONFIDENCE AND TRUST THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ATTACK HIM. STEVE: RIGHT. HE HAS GOT TO GIVE US THE TRUST THAT OF COURSE HE IS GOING TO DO WHAT WE SAY. BUT EVERY LEADER IS THANKING THE PRESIDENT FOR WHAT HE DID ON NORTH KOREA. STEVE: KIM JONG UN IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF NEGOTIATOR THAN HIS FATHER. VERY MUCH. SO AND THE PRESIDENT TAPPED THAT. HE TAPPED THAT. THAT'S WHY KIM SENT HIM A NICE LETTER SAYING I WANT TO MEET AGAIN. THE PRESIDENT IS VERY GOOD WHEN YOU PUT HIM IN FRONT OF A FOREIGN LEADER. BRIAN: ONE THING IS CLEAR I THINK YOU ARE GETTING RESPECT ON BOTH SIDES, I WATCH YOU ON EVERY SINGLE SHOW YOU HAVE THE ANSWERS, ESPECIALLY AS GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HAVE THE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE ON ALL THESE THINGS. THEY SAY ONE OF THE KEYS IS, AMBASSADOR, THE DEAL YOU CUT HAVE YOU DIRECT ACCESS TO THE PRESIDENT. ANY TYPE OF GRAY AREA YOU CAN CALL AND YOU CAN RELAY. IS THAT TRUE? HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT? HE IS UNBELIEVABLY RESPONSIVE. I GO TO D.C. ONCE A WEEKS. I SEE HIM. I TALK TO HIM. IF I NEED ANYTHING I CAN PICK UP THE PHONE. IF I DISAGREE WITH SOMETHING, HE LISTENS. HE MAY DO IT. HE MAY NOT DO IT. BUT I HAVE I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE RELATIONSHIP I HAVE WITH THE PRESIDENT. THE REASON I'M TABLE TO DO THE JOB I DO IS BECAUSE IS HE SO INVOLVED. LAST NIGHT HE WENT AND HOSTED MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THEIR FOREIGN MINISTERS. THINK ABOUT THAT. NOT WORLD LEADERS. THE ONES THAT MAKE THE DECISIONS EVERY DAY ON THOSE NORTH KOREAN SANCTIONS ON THE ARMS EMBARGO. STEVE: I BET THEY LOVED THAT. THAT BUYS SO MUCH GOODWILL FOR THE UNITED STATES. HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO IT. AINSLEY: AMBASSADOR YOU WEAR THE SOUTH CAROLINA EMBLEM. GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA, U.N. AMBASSADOR NOW YOU HAVE A GLOBAL VIEW. ANY PLANS TO RUN FOR OFFICE? I MEAN RUN FOR PRESIDENT ONE DAY AS A FEMALE? IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I WILL TELL YOU NEVER FORGET WHERE YOU COME FROM. THAT'S WHY I WEAR MY SOUTH CAROLINA NECKLACE. I WILL TELL YOU I HAVE NOT THOUGHT ONCE ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THESE THINGS WHERE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT 2020. I WOULD NEVER RUN AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. I WOULD CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENT. I MEAN, WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAS DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB. SO, I'M GOOD ABOUT NOT THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE. Steve: YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THOUGH IS TRAFFIC BECAUSE NOW THERE IS GRIDLOCK BETWEEN HERE AND THE UNITED NATIONS BECAUSE
