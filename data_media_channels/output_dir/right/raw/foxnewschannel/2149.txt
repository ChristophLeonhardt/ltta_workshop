1
00:00:01,091 --> 00:00:02,259
THAT IS A CRIME, SHE HAS TO BE

2
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:04,928
HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

3
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:06,130
>> Martha: CORY, THANK YOU.

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,131
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE

5
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:07,464
TONIGHT.

6
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:08,799
SO MY NEXT GUEST IS A FORMER

7
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:11,301
TRIM PAINT SR. ADVISER WHO WAS

8
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:12,703
DRILLED BY A SPECIAL COUNSEL

9
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:14,271
MUELLER'S TEAM YESTERDAY.

10
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:17,307
AND HE JOINS US NOW IN AN

11
00:00:17,307 --> 00:00:18,075
EXCLUSIVE.

12
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:19,376
MICHAEL CAVUTO, THANK YOU FOR

13
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:20,344
JOINING THE PROGRAM TONIGHT.

14
00:00:20,344 --> 00:00:22,613
>> THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME.

15
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:23,480
>> Martha: ALREADY QUESTIONED

16
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,149
BY THE HILL, BUT YESTERDAY YOU

17
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:27,184
SAT DOWN WITH MUELLER'S FOLKS,

18
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:28,786
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

19
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:29,520
>> YESTERDAY WAS MY THIRD TRIP

20
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,889
TO WASHINGTON IN ORDER TO TALK

21
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:34,358
ABOUT THE RUSSIA COLLUSION,

22
00:00:34,358 --> 00:00:36,093
DELUSION.

23
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:37,928
AND IT WAS WITH MUELLER, AND

24
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:38,896
WITH SENATE INTELLIGENCE.

25
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:40,097
IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT

26
00:00:40,097 --> 00:00:41,031
I DID AT SENATE INTELLIGENCE AND

27
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:44,968
WHAT I ENDURED AT THE SELECT

28
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:48,705
COMMITTEE LAST YEAR.

29
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:50,674
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION WAS

30
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:52,176
REALLY NOT TRYING TO DEFINE

31
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:52,743
SOMETHING.

32
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:54,011
EVERY QUESTION THEY ASKED, THEY

33
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:56,680
ALREADY HAVE THE ANSWER TO.

34
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,915
SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THEY ARE

35
00:00:57,915 --> 00:00:59,149
QUITE DIRECTIVE IN WHAT THEY ARE

36
00:00:59,149 --> 00:00:59,450
DOING.

37
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,587
THEY STILL BELIEVE IN THE THEORY

38
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:05,022
OF RUSSIA COLLUSION, BUT OF

39
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:06,490
COURSE MY PERSPECTIVE IS A

40
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,658
LITTLE BIT TILTED, BECAUSE I

41
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:09,092
WOULD NOT BE ASKED ABOUT

42
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:10,527
OBSTRUCTION, I WAS NOT IN THE

43
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:11,161
ADMINISTRATION WHEN THESE

44
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:12,729
ALLEGATIONS WERE LAUNCHED, AND

45
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,031
THEY WOULD NOT ASK ME ABOUT

46
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:16,433
FINANCIAL CRIMES, BECAUSE I HAVE

47
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:18,502
NOTHING TO DO WITH SOME OF THE

48
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:20,304
ALLEGATIONS AROUND SOME OF THE

49
00:01:20,304 --> 00:01:21,071
OTHER FOLKS.

50
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:22,272
IT WOULD BE ALL RUSSIA

51
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:24,308
CONCLUSION YOU WOULD THINK, BUT

52
00:01:24,308 --> 00:01:25,776
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THAT IS NOT

53
00:01:25,776 --> 00:01:28,278
CLOSED YET.

54
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:29,680
>> Martha: NOT THE SPECIFIC

55
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,981
QUESTIONS, BUT IN TERMS OF YOUR

56
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:32,483
FEELING FROM WHAT THEY WERE

57
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,885
ASKING, DID YOU GET ANY SENSE OF

58
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:36,286
HOW FAR ALONG THEY ARE OR IF

59
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:37,588
THEY SEEM TO BE WRAPPING THIS UP

60
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:38,922
OR WHETHER THEY ARE MIDWAY

61
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:39,723
THROUGH?

62
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:42,159
DID YOU GET ANY INDICATION OF

63
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,093
THAT?

64
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:44,461
>> I THINK THAT THEY ARE PRETTY

65
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:47,231
FAR ALONG, WITHOUT INTERFERING

66
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:48,465
WITH THE INVESTIGATION, I HAVE

67
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:50,701
TO BE QUITE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I

68
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:53,170
SAY, IN FACT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT

69
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,937
OF AN INTIMIDATING SESSION, SO I

70
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:57,274
AM BEING OVERCAUTIOUS.

71
00:01:57,274 --> 00:01:57,774
>> Martha: HOW SO?

72
00:01:57,774 --> 00:01:59,476
>> IS VERY CLEAR THAT THEY DID

73
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:01,144
NOT WANT ME TO TALK ABOUT THIS

74
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:01,879
STUFF.

75
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,713
AND I THINK THAT I CAN

76
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:05,082
CHARACTERIZE WHAT I EXCHANGED

77
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:07,317
WITH THEM, BUT I THINK THAT

78
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:09,686
EVERYBODY HAS BEEN ON CAUTION BY

79
00:02:09,686 --> 00:02:10,854
THE MUELLER TEAM GOING OUT THERE

80
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:13,991
AND TALKING ABOUT A CHAPTER IN

81
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:15,893
VERSES, HIGHLY DISCOURAGED.

82
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:18,128
IF SOMEBODY OVER THERE GETS MAD,

83
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:20,564
THEY CAN INVITE ME BACK TO

84
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:20,964
WASHINGTON.

85
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:22,065
>> Martha: I UNDERSTAND, AND I

86
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:24,201
DO NOT DOUBT IT.

87
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:27,204
IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION, AND I

88
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:28,772
KNOW THAT YOU CANNOT TALK ABOUT

89
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:31,408
THEM SPECIFICALLY, BUT IN TERMS

90
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:33,277
OF THE WAY THAT THEY WERE

91
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,878
QUESTIONING YOU, DO YOU FEEL

92
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:37,548
LIKE YOU ARE A TARGET OR THAT

93
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:38,916
YOU, WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE AWAY?

94
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,651
DID YOU WALK OUT FEELING, OKAY,

95
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:43,053
I AM DONE AND THEY GOT WHAT THEY

96
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:44,454
WANTED AND THEY DO NOT NEED

97
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:46,256
ANYTHING ELSE FROM ME?

98
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:47,925
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY TOLD ME

99
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:49,259
AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END,

100
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:50,060
AND MY ATTORNEY WHEN THEY

101
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,562
INVITED ME AND I DECIDED TO COME

102
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:53,030
WILLINGLY THAT I AM A WITNESS,

103
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,666
NOT A SUBJECT OR A TARGET.

104
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,100
AND AFTERWARD THAT DID NOT

105
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,702
CHANGE, BUT I THINK THAT THEY

106
00:02:58,702 --> 00:02:59,503
WERE LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY

107
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:01,238
TO MAKE ME A SUBJECT IN THIS

108
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:03,707
THING, BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY

109
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:04,641
ARE TALKING ABOUT WIKILEAKS AND

110
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:09,446
D.C. LEAKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

111
00:03:09,446 --> 00:03:10,681
>> Martha: YOU SAID THAT THEY

112
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:12,015
KNEW MORE ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN

113
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:12,950
THEY NEEDED YOURSELF, WHAT DID

114
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,750
YOU MEAN BY THAT?

115
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,285
>> I ACTUALLY SAID THAT THEY

116
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:16,687
KNOW MORE ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN

117
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:18,589
THEN ANY ONE PERSON DOES WHO

118
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:19,089
WORKED THERE.

119
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:20,958
THEY HAVE ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS

120
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:21,491
THAT WERE PRODUCED.

121
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,126
THEY HAVE ALL OF THE EMAILS FROM

122
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:23,727
EVERYONE.

123
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:24,895
THEY HAVE FURTHER DOCUMENTATION

124
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:28,498
FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE

125
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:30,300
CAMPAIGN, THEIR EMAILS, THEIR

126
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,601
TEXT.

127
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:32,903
THEY KNOW CHAPTER AND VERSE ON

128
00:03:32,903 --> 00:03:34,471
THE CAMPAIGN, AND YET, IT DOES

129
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:38,008
NOT SOUND LIKE THEY HAVE PROOF

130
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:38,675
OF COLLUSION DELUSION.

131
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:39,810
>> Martha: MICHAEL CAVUTO,

132
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,510
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

133
00:03:40,510 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT, AND
