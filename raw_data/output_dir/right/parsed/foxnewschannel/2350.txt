SHEPARD SMITH.
YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO
STARTS RIGHT NOW.
>> President Trump: NO, I DON'T
THINK HE'S PLAYING.
IT'S NEVER GONE THIS FAR.
I DON'T THINK IT HAS HAD THIS
ENTHUSIASM FOR SOMEBODY, FOR
THEM WANTING TO MAKE A DEAL.
YEAH, I AGREE, THE UNITED STATES
HAS BEEN PLAYED BEAUTIFULLY LIKE
A FIDDLE.
BECAUSE YOU HAD A DIFFERENT KIND
OF A LEADER.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE MADE.
>> Neil: THE PRESIDENT CONVINCED
THAT THE BROMANCE QUICKLY STRUCK
UP BY THE NORTH AND SOUTH CROW
AN LEADERS THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON.
ITLES TO THE TREND THAT THE
PRESIDENT LIKES AND HOPES TO
LEVERAGE OFF OF, WHEN HE MEETS
WITH THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER.
AND JUST MAYBE A FEW WEEKS.
WELCOME, I'M NEIL CAVUTO, FOX ON
TOP OF EVERYTHING GOING THE
PRESIDENT'S WAY.
OR SO HE SAYS.
AND GERMAN LEADER WHO SEEMS TO
DPROO WE FOR THE TIME BEING EVEN
THOUGH THAT GOT DISAGREEABLE.
WE'RE ON TOP OF ALL OF THOSE
DEVELOPMENTS.
BLAKE BERMAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE
ON A CERTAIN MEETING MOMENTS
AGO.
BLAKE?
>> HI, NEIL, YOU HEARD FROM THE
PRESIDENT THAT SOUND BITE WHICH
IS IN THE OVAL OFFICE EARLIER
TODAY, HE SAID THAT PAST
ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE BEEN PLAYED
LIKE A FIDDLE BY THE NORTH
KOREANS, HE SAID THAT IS NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN TO US.
A LITTLE WHILE AGO AT A JOINT
NEWS CONFERENCE WITH ANGELA
MERKEL I ASKED THE PRESIDENT IF
HE FEELS AS IF HE NEEDS TO BE
THE CLOSER TO GET A DEAL DONE, A
PEACE DEAL DONE, ON THE KOREAN
PENINSULA.
LISTEN HERE.
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS TO
EVENTUALLY GET SETTLED BETWEEN
NORTH AND SOUTH CROW A.
>> President Trump: I THINK I
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY.
OTHER HIMSELF SHOULD HAVE DONE
IT.
I THINK THE RESPONSIBILITY HAS
FALLEN ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
AND I THINK WE HAVE, I THINK I
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE IF
I CAN DO IT.
AND IF I CAN'T DO IT IT WILL BE
A VERY TOUGH TIME FOR A LOT OF
COUNTRIES.
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE.
IT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT I
HOPE CAN I DO FOR THE WORLD.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS ALSO BEEN
RECENTLY TALKING HOW HE HAS A
STRONG WORKING WERATIONSHIP HIS
ADMINISTRATION DOES WITH THE
NORTH KOREANS.
WHEN I ASKED IF HE HAS SPOKEN
WITH KIM JONG-UN OR PLANS TO DO
SO BEFORE THE TWO MEET, HE
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY GO THERE.
>> President Trump: I DON'T WANT
TO COMMENT ON THAT.
>> DO YOU PLAN ON SPEAKING TO
HIM BEFORE?
>> WE HAVE A GOOD WORKING
RELATIONSHIP.
WE'RE SETTING UP A MEETING.
THINGS OF CHANGED VERY RADICALLY
FROM A FEW MONTHS AGO.
YOU KNOW THE NAME CALLING AND A
LOT OF OTHER THINGS.
>> FOR THAT MEETING, NEIL, THE
PRESIDENT SAYS IT'S SKILL
SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN THE
COMING WEEKS AND THEY'RE DOWN TO
TWO DIFFERENT SITES AS TO WHERE
