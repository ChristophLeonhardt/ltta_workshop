you're gonna love this podcast he's gonna have some of the top comedians and comedy writers on there so if you want to check that out along with the entire audio network go to T y-t-dot-com slash audio all right this is a story that T YT investigates discovered it's brought to you by Ken clip enstein it's a small little story it's about the immigration situation but this one is not about kids about dogs but the comparison is uncomfortable so let me go to the story instead of space blankets dogs and of course you remember the kids that are being separated from their family or the ones that came in unaccompanied are you getting some space blankets and sleeping on the floor some of them are so Ken X place instead of space blankets dogs in the custody of Customs and Border Protection a division of Department of Homeland Security will be treated to quote plush double-sided sheepskin bedding at the peninsula pet resort in California sounds lovely according to federal procurement records reviewed by TYT so more details on how the dogs are treated as opposed to humans the dogs will sleep indoors and the resource 177 separate doggie suites which feature frequent maid service and clean bedding everyday as well as raised kettle decking according to Peninsula pet resorts website now am I happy that the dogs are being treated well great but god I wish we treated the kids as well so now more from the website of this company that's taking care of the dogs for Customs and Border Protection they declare on their website quote most importantly we provide loving care now again normal I get it I understand it I'm glad that they're treating the dogs well but it is a stark juxtaposition so the stories we hear about how the children are not allowed to be held by anyone so if they are crying they cannot console them and their parents are not there those are adults and I understand why they have that rule but they do not get loving care there's a report that we broke American Airlines flight attendants saying that they're the people transporting the kids would not allow them to eat the food while they eat while the people doing the transporting eat the food right next to them they wouldn't allow them to watch the entertainment they wouldn't allow them to interact with anyone or to look anyone in the eye so the dogs get loving care but the humans not so much so as clip-ins team points out by contrast CBP reportedly has made undocumented detainees sleep in freezing-cold cells on concrete floors without mats President Trump has referred to undocumented immigrants as quote animals and then finally the one that really actually got to me was this part another advantage that the dogs may have over detain children is outdoor playtime although detention centers reportedly permit children to play outside for two hours each day Peninsula pet resort allows its guests which are dogs up to four hours about door playtime daily the kids are not supposed to be prisoners and they're not animals let them outside two hours outside there's no reason for it I get it that you can't let them leave I understand that but it and it's not a matter of whether we allow them to stay in the country or not the question is how humanely do we treat them when they're in the country temporarily yes we can allow them to go outside within confined area for more than two hours a day we couldn't let the dogs do it why can't we let the kids do it ah man it's heartbreaking they were treating some animals better than we treat those kids in those detention centers you know a lot of times deers talk about how when authoritarian governments go to dehumanize people they come and compare them to animals which Trump did they talk about how they carry disease and they infest a country and interrupted all of those but a lot of people in America love their dogs of course which is a great thing and so they view the dogs is innocent that's true and and that's a great thing but we've got Republican congressman on TV saying well are those really innocent kids and where the parents really innocent maybe it's terrorists trying to smuggle in kids or ms-13 trying to smuggle themselves in by having the kids with no evidence at all so the idea is they're guilty they're guilty they're guilty so to them maybe does make more sense to treat the dogs more humanely than they treat actual human beings I think well the dogs are innocent I don't know about those five-year-old kids though two easy ways for young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then
