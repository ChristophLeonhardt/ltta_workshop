let me show you something shocking you know that on Monday Donald Trump revealed that he has negotiated a very detailed bilateral trade agreement with Mexico bilateral just means two sides the US and Mexico is in Canada's not part of it well Trump wanted to talk to Justin Trudeau about that I don't know what he wanted to say to invite Canada in to tell Trudeau the details just to take a reading of Trudeau's on views on things I don't know whatever I mean it's a successor trade deal to NAFTA the huge treaty that Canada Mexico in the United States are in right now it was at the very least a courtesy call to Trudeau but a leader to leader call like that who knows what would have been said what leader in the entire world would not take a phone call from Donald Trump even if that leader hated him in fact especially if that leader hated them wouldn't you want to hear what he wanted to tell you I mean China's President Xi Russia's Vladimir Putin North Korea's Kim even if you have a disagreement with I'm actually especially if you have a disagreement with Trump wouldn't you want to hear what Donald Trump thought was so important for you to hear that he wants you to hear it from him himself I can't imagine turning down such a phone call I can't imagine anything being more important to urge and especially if like Canada we are dependent on the United States for trade we are so intertwined with America in every way well Justin Trudeau refused to take the phone call he refused Trump called Trudeau wouldn't he come to the phone I'm not kidding of course I only learned about this from the foreign press our own state broadcaster that CBC would never report something so embarrassing so revealing about our Dear Leader this is from Bloomberg's White House reporter look at this tweet Trump had wanted to speak to Trudeau this a.m. before the Mexico trade deal announcement at 11:00 a.m. but Canada said Trudeau had a schedule conflict at the requested hour sources told me in Jos Wingrove a scheduling conflict but that's that's not true every day Justin Trudeau publishes his schedule this is in entire official schedule from Monday it's just you know private time he's got some meetings maybe he or maybe that's just code for him taking another day off work he's had more than 20 vacation days so far in 2018 and he calls those personal days on top of regular weekends and statutory holidays but it's not like he was at an incredibly important function he had no public functions he was not at some critically important summit meeting he was not even in the House of Commons he wasn't traveling and even if he was doing any of those things could he not really step out of another engagement for 10 minutes just pretend he had to go to the bathroom or something I don't know sir I I know we're having an important conversation you know Youth Council of Papineau I know we're having an important conversation dairy farmer of Quebec I just got the president United States on the other line how about you take a coffee break and I'll be back in ten who on earth would say no that who on earth would be more important and even if they were more important who on earth wouldn't understand the need for Justin Trudeau to talk to Donald Trump for ten minutes in the middle and after negotiation it is obviously not a real excuse even if he were on a plane which he wasn't the Prime Minister's plane can take phone calls it is a lie that could not possibly be true the truth is a Trudeau was snubbing Donald Trump well Trump returned the favor pretty hard I'd say this is what Donald Trump said at his announcement from the Oval Office on Monday with the Mexican president on the speakerphone Canada will start negotiations shortly I'll be calling the Prime Minister very soon and we'll start negotiation and if they'd like to negotiate fairly we'll we'll do that you know they have tariffs of almost 300% on some of our dairy products so we can't have that we're not going to stand for that I think with Canada frankly the easiest thing we can do is to tariffs they're cars coming in it's a tremendous amount of money and it's a very negotiation it could end in one day and we taken a lot of money the following day but I think we'll give them a chance to probably have a separate deal we could have a separate deal or we could put it into this field that's stunning but it's not surprising and stunning because our best friend the United States is no longer our best friend but not surprising though because for nearly two years Justin Trudeau's liberals with the full support of our state broadcaster the CBC I've done there past to pick fights with Donald Trump it's nuts Trump never really paid attention to Canada before which was good he just took us for granted which is good like we take America for granted I guess Trump always instead focuses ire on China and Mexico when it came to trade irritants because we Canadians more or less have balanced trade with America that means we buy as much from them as they buy from us so Trump never really cared about us until Trudeau just started irritating Trump again and again so gratuitously sometimes it was just personal attacks remember this one right before Trump was elected I think however I've been very very clear in my approach as a feminist as someone who has stood clearly and strongly all my life around issues of sexual harassment standing against violence against women that I don't need to make any further comment at this time that was Justin Trudeau more or less accusing Donald Trump of physical violence against women a bit ironic now that we know that Justin Trudeau himself groped women but that's politically insane that's pretty much how every liberal in Trudeau's office thinks and talks though and they haven't really muted it at all over the past two years most of the time Trump just didn't pay attention or if he did he didn't show it it's like a little mouse nibbling at an elephant's toes Trump did raise some objections about our 300% dairy import tariffs but that's not huge in the whole scheme of things he raised objections to cheap subsidized Chinese steel being dumped into the US by coming through Canada but again that's not even our problem really it's just a small thing we have to cut out the Chinese which is Trump's real rivals but Trudeau was so irritating so often and Christiane Freeland our foreign minister was so irritating so often it had to be on purpose like that speech that Christie Freeland gave earlier this year in Washington at the foreign policy magazine in a real in-your-face way when she won a diplomat of the Year award when people feel their economic future is in jeopardy when they believe their children have fewer opportunities than they themselves had in their youth that's when people are vulnerable to the demagogue who scapegoats the outsider the other whether it's immigrants at home or trading partners abroad so you're in a trade negotiation with Donald Trump you fly down to his capital city you meet with a room of chattering class Washington insiders lobbyists pundits to bash Trump not very veiled bashing of Trump was it really worth it though being called diplomat of the year it's sort of like those world's best dad mugs you know you can buy it as a souvenir stuff world's best dad I mean it's not a real contest right it's it's a joke right I mean if you're the world's best diplomat first of all you probably aren't known because the best diplomats achieve their goals for their country not for their own celebrity you know what might actually be the world's best diplomat now that I think about this terror Sergey Lavrov you know that guy that's Vladimir Putin's Foreign Minister Putin invaded Georgia and there were no real penalties against him from George W Bush so Putin invaded Crimea and an extent with no real penalties from Barack Obama Putin shot down a jetliner over Ukraine remember that no real penalties Putin managed to get Angela Merkel to agree to buy a third of Germany's energy from Russia Putin managed to essentially take over Syria from Barack Obama Sergey Lavrov did those things he doesn't care about giving preening speeches he gets things done Booton awful things sometimes can you name anything Kristy Freeland has got done for her client that is us in fact other than Iran or Cuba is there a single country in the world that you can name that is more sympathetic or more supportive or more allied with Canada today than when Trudeau and Freeland took over I mean just think of the big ones Russia China India Saudi Arabia Israel the United States can you name a single country that we have stronger ties with now than before Trudeau and Freeland took over diplomat of the year what a joke well our diplomat of the year was in Germany on Monday giving the same anti-american speech isn't that funny while Mexico and the United States were celebrating their new agreement you know as I mentioned the other day the Mexican Foreign Minister has visited the White House 45 times and visited the house of Jared Kushner Trump's son-in-law 10 more times that's 55 visits no wonder he got a great deal in fact I'm not sure how Mexico's foreign minister could really have been doing anything else with his time if he literally had 55 meetings in Washington I bet he's got to have an apartment in Washington he's probably maybe even lives there obviously this was the most important thing in his life and for his country's prosperity and he acted like it don't you think I haven't heard of him giving any speeches bashing America or getting a best diplomat mug he got a deal instead and I think it's a good deal for Trump if I read it right it keeps out cheap Chinese parts from Mexican made cars being sold into America it requires higher labor costs and Mexican the car factories so that they don't deeply undercut American factories that helps Mexican workers but it obviously helps American factories be more competitive these are interesting deals and complicated deals and detailed deals and there are other parts of this deal too including on intellectual property and it goes much beyond cars and Trump said he's getting along so well with his Mexican counterparts now they're talking about continuing their talks on other sensitive issues like border security and if you've met someone fifty five times you probably get along with them pretty well by now I mean how many times have you met any friends in your life at you know both sides are obviously getting something positive out of it you know that it was a success from Mexico when that crazy Trump hater I don't know if you know this guy he's the former Mexican President Vicente Fox he is a cook on Twitter and here's one of his tweets this is translated by Twitter automatically into English he was tweeting about how important a deal this was for Mexico today there is much to celebrate great triumphs for Mexico for president Pena and his great negotiating team Bravo great win you know it's we all win trade is always a win was so this guy hates Trump he has in the past condemned this same Mexican government for dealing with Trump but but then Mexico pulled a rabbit out of a hat for both sides I guess Trump has done enough deals in his life to know the best ones are ones where both sides can say they won something so Chrystia Freeland saw this and she hopped on a plane and flew from Germany where she was giving her Trump bashing speech she flew to Washington and listen what she had to say when she landed there yesterday really paves the way for what Canada good week is the fact that Mexico has made some significant concessions particularly in the area of labor and Apple original cars for our governments good jobs for working people in Canada has always been our priority and these concessions really are going to be valuable for workers in Canada and in the United States who have been concerned for some time about their jobs going to lower wage jurisdictions so she's really trash-talking the deal that Mexico got implying that they really got taken advantage of about the Americans boy they were so dumb to do a bilateral deal instead of having Chrystia Freeland there to help them with the hard parts I think that's what she was saying there well here's the Mexican ambassador to Canada on TV the other day he sounds pretty happy sounds pretty confident he's not spiking the football or anything I don't think so he's just saying yeah his country got a deal take a look actually the Canadian government the Prime Minister just a few minutes ago has said and yesterday global affairs that they welcomed the progress made we hope the DISA the DISA breakthroughs that Mexico that Mexico made with the US will be positive and will be good for Canada so today this morning Christie Freeland was finally invited for a meeting with the US Trade Representative and that's a special office with the top negotiator in America Robert light Heiser's name he he's not elected like Christie Freeland he's appointed all he does is do deals he's a pro he's not an ex journalist like Christie Freeland so Freeland finally gets a meeting at his office and you know who else is coming Jared Kushner the consummate Trump fixer is there too and as you know he's also Trump's son-in-law in some ways he's been in Trump's secret weapon he's like they call him the Trump whisperer he's the guy who gets tough deals because he's family he can speak candidly than the president in ways that no one else can because he can't really fire family and here's how that went let me quote Jared Kushner just walked in for the meeting with Canada the Canadian mr. of Foreign Affairs is not here she is late late but but we know she was in town she flew in yesterday she was late how did she get lost we saw the clip of her standing in front of that same office on Tuesday so she knows where it is did she just hit the snooze button on her alarm too many times and maybe her staff forgot to phone her at the at the hotel did she have a more important meeting like Justin Trudeau claim to it was this not the most important meeting in her entire public life and oh also for the lives about in 160,000 people who work in Ontario's auto industry who will get smacked by Trump if we get a trade war late late for a meeting with Jared Kushner and the trade rep yeah that's a psychological tactic that's a dominance play I'm making you wait I'm more important than you so you can wait for me when I'm good and ready it's the same bizarre move the can the played last year remember this trade deal in Vietnam when all of our other allies were there remember Australia and you see that empty chair there with the Canadian flag in front of it on the left bottom left of the screen there Canada just didn't show up we didn't just spite America we spiked all spite in all those countries see the Japanese flag there no notice no warning no courtesy no diplomacy no explanation we just didn't show up by we I mean Trudeau and his cabinet you know you can do that kind of power move I guess if you're Donald Trump himself but but not even too often because then people think you're just unreliable your word doesn't mean anything you're not a promise keeper whether people love you or fear you they have to know you mean what you say and not showing up at a scheduled meeting that's actually not a sign of toughness it's a sign of unreliability of unserious of capriciousness and that doesn't work if you are christie of real and who is already known for all of the flaws and who's boss Justin Trudeau just refused to take a phone call from Trump on Monday in the past when negotiating with teeny-tiny Belgium you know the country that's famous for making chocolate Christian Freeland thought crying would get her a trade deal remember that kind of that is my mom my pelson that motivator for me you Samba every doll for my Oh Canada including your never ban me pack up a balloon methanol does well pinochle in sickness turn on and then I fetch in payee Jia devalue seat up obey and come to Canada yeah and after negotiations Freeland didn't go for the tears she thought sending cute little email emojis you know I'm talking about those little smiley faces though that would do the job remember that the European trade commissioner Cecilia malmström and I call each other sisters in trade we sign our emails hugs yes we did well we sometimes send each other smiley faces in particularly difficult moments yeah that didn't even work with the chocolate making superpowers I don't think that's working with Donald Trump you know that looks weak and pitiful but even that was better than the pure disrespect of not taking phone calls and not showing up for a meeting hey let me ask you something do you think Donald Trump actually means that when he says he wants to put tariffs on our auto industry I think he means that man in Montenegrin Oh convinced me of this this week Trump has already put tariffs on Canada for certain things he's in a huge trade war with China that's why he smacked our steel for the Chinese steel is being put through Canada Trump just I think was today his last quarters GDP growth was revised upwards to four point two percent on a quarterly basis his economy is so strong right now remember the 10 times larger than us he won't even notice a bump in the road if Canada retaliates I think Trump actually wants a warm man he convinced me of this so that Trump can bring our Canadian auto industry back down to the United States and once you move those factories there they ain't ever coming back I actually think Trump wants a trade war to relocate those factories the crazy thing is Trudeau is behaving like he wants a trade war to Justin Trudeau already killed off Canada's oil and gas and pipeline industry with the help of Rachel Notley 100 billion dollars gone now he's gunning for Ontario's auto industry Trudeau I think his strategy is exactly what Stephen Harper warned us about Trudeau wants to run against Trump in the 2019 Canadian election if that really was your strategy you would refuse phone calls you would show up late for meetings you would give insulting speeches - wouldn't you if you were trying to scupper the deal I'm sorry my friends unless something changes in the next 48 hours which is what Trump says the deadline is I think we are heading into a deep recession in this country courtesy of our diplomat of the year and her man-child of a boss that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on
