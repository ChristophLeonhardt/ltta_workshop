let's talk about let's talk about an Obama general HR McMaster he's out McMasters defense here and I know you're a man you like McMaster I love McMaster as a cavalry guy like me may master was in seven Corps and Desert Storm like me except he was up front and I was way in the back he is a brilliant guy who also buys into a lot of the problem ideologies of the military remember the military you know I when I went on a war college do you think I spent a lot of time talking about strategy a little bit but it the the purpose of the Army War College is to civil I guys from the field so that they can mix and mingle with people in Washington and not scare them by saying things like our biggest threat is terrorism instead of our biggest threat is you know with the weather in a hundred years right right looks long and and and he's part of that he's the kind of guy I mean he's killed more he's killed more jihadis than you and I and a hundred people come bomb he's also the kind of guy well you know we shouldn't call it Islamic terrorism because blah blah blah have a good battle he's that kind of conventional thinking you could have a good battlefield general but that doesn't necessarily mean they should be policymakers and I think that's the other problem with it that's your problem with the position is that to the extent it's supposed to be a policymaker well it should be is a staff position you thought about national security adviser yeah yeah he and he did a good job of bringing military decision-making process to a chaotic organization he came in and they began to provide product for the president and it it was good product look at the successes we've had Isis is defeated North Korea's coming to the table Iran is terrified so you know to the extent that McMaster was that acting as the chief of staff I think he was a great choice really really important content and bringing you every day and I want to keep bringing it to you it's important that I do I love bringing it to you so help me do that by subscribing to our premium service at ww the rebel that media forward-slash shows
