REFORM IS LIKELY TO MEET THE

00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:19,729
SAME FATE AS EVERY OTHER ATTEMPT

SEPTEMBER.

11
00:00:35,177 --> 00:00:35,912
I SAID THIS FOR A LONG TIME.

12
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:37,413
PEOPLE SHOULDN'T GO HOME FOR THE

13
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:40,816
AUGUST RECESS.

14
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:41,617
I WOULD DEFINITELY SHUT DOWN THE

15
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:45,121
WALL.

16
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:45,755
ABSOLUTELY.

ATLANTA, GEORGIA.

21
00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:54,564
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

22
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:54,997
FIRST TO YOU.

23
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:57,033
THIS IS A PRETTY BOLD

24
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:58,501
PROCLAMATION BY STEVE BANNING.

25
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:00,102
ARE YOU ON BOARD WITH THAT ABOUT

26
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:06,008
A MONTH BEFORE THE MID-TERMS?

27
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:06,876
>> DID YOU SEE A BOLD

28
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:07,577
PROCLAMATION BY STEVE BANNING?

29
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:10,479
I DIDN'T REALIZED THERE WERE SO

30
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,448
WORRIED ABOUT PROCLAMATION SPICE

31
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,748
EVENT.

32
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:15,151
LELAND: ABC NEWS IS.

33
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:15,885
I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE OR YOU

34
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:19,755
ARE, BUT GO AHEAD.

35
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:21,357
>> ABC NEWS CAN THINK ABOUT IT

36
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:22,291
ALL THEY WISH.

37
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:22,825
THAT'S TOTALLY FINE.

38
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:25,261
THE IMMIGRATION CONVERSATION HAS

39
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:26,362
TO COME DOWN TO WHETHER WE HAVE

40
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:26,862
A BORDER OR NOT.

41
00:01:26,862 --> 00:01:29,498
IT HAS TO COME DOWN TO A MUCH

42
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:34,270
GREATER OPEN CONVERSATION AS

43
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:34,870
OPPOSED TO THE PARTISAN

44
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,605
SCREAMING FOR STEALING CHILDREN

45
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:36,872
OUT OF PEOPLE'S ARMS AND

46
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:40,076
COMPARING THAT MANEUVER OF

47
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:44,547
PEOPLE HAVING TO FOLLOW THE LAW.

48
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:45,047
HOLD ON A SECOND.

49
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:48,117
COMPARING IT TO THE HOLOCAUST.

50
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:50,252
LELAND: WE ARE GOING TO GET TO

51
00:01:50,252 --> 00:01:50,753
THAT IN A MINUTE.

52
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:51,487
I PROMISE YOU WE'LL GET TO ALL

53
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,222
OF THAT IN A MINUTE.

54
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:55,825
IN THE MEANTIME, BACK TO THE

55
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:56,525
QUESTION I ORIGINALLY ASKED.

56
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:57,259
GOOD IDEA TO DO AND SHUT DOWN

57
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:00,296
THE GOVERNMENT OVER BORDER WHILE

58
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:00,863
FUNDING OR NOT?

59
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:01,230
>> SORRY.

60
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,698
THE ANSWER IS THAT A THINK

61
00:02:02,698 --> 00:02:04,333
THAT'S WHAT IT WILL COME TOO.

62
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,669
THE PRESIDENT DOES WANT THE WALL

63
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:08,471
IN THE MONEY FOR THE WALL.

64
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:11,841
IT IS MATTER OF SYMBOLISM.

65
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:15,344
I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET.

66
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,045
>> WIDGER SAID REPRESENTATIVE

THE PROGRAM AND DESPITE ALL THE

69
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:20,016
GOOD INTENTIONS, HE FEELS AS

70
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:21,517
THOUGH THESE TWO IMMIGRATION

71
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:22,985
BILLS AMOUNT OF GOOD LUCK BILL

72
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:23,719
AND THE COMPROMISE BILL ARE NOT

73
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,289
GOING TO GET THROUGH EITHER.

74
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,090
WE WILL SEE IF IT COMES TO THAT.

75
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,696
VERY MEL MIGHT IF YOU LISTEN TO

76
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:33,996
FOLKS.

77
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:36,232
DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN A

78
00:02:36,232 --> 00:02:39,035
CONSTRUCTIONIST VIEW ON THIS

79
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:39,301
ONE.

80
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:40,736
THEY VIEW IT AS A CAMPAIGN ISSUE

81
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:41,103
THAN SALT.

82
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:45,007
DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS?

83
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:46,275
>> I DO ENJOY THE PROCESS OF

84
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:48,044
WATCHING REPUBLICANS CANNIBALIZE

85
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:50,846
THEMSELVES ON THE MODERATE BILL

86
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:53,749
AN EXTREME RIGHT BILL.

87
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:56,285
WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS FIND A

88
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:58,220
FUNDING MECHANISM IN CHUCK

89
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,954
SCHUMER SAID THEY'RE WILLING TO

00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:02,725
WORK ON THE WALL, FIND A PATH TO

91
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,561
CITIZENSHIP FOR THE

92
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,062
$1.8 MILLION.

93
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,664
>> DEMOCRATS ARE NOT WILLING TO

94
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:11,233
WORK TOGETHER WITH REPUBLICAN ON

95
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,169
ANYTHING THAT WOULD RESEMBLE A

96
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:14,236
COMPROMISE THAT THEY MADE A

97
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,738
DECISION THIS IS BETTER TO HAVE

98
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:19,375
BEEN A CAMPAIGN ISSUE.

99

THEY ATTEMPTED TO WORK IN GOOD

104
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:28,417
FAITH ON THIS ISSUE.

105
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,151
NOT THE MODERATES IN THE CENTER

106
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:32,054
OF THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE TO

107
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:33,456
WORRY ABOUT OCTOBER OR

108
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:35,291
RADICALIZE THIS ISSUE.

SCHIFF THIS MORNING.

113
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:50,172
>> THE ADMINISTRATION IS USING

114
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:53,876
THE GRIEF, THE TEARS COME UNDER

115
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:54,543
PAIN OF THESE KIDS TO BUILD

116
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:57,213
THEIR WALL.

117
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:59,415
LELAND: TONY, HERE IS YOUR

118
00:03:59,415 --> 00:03:59,882
OPPORTUNITY.

119

120
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:04,220
ENOUGH.

121
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,189
THIS IS JUST ONE MORE PIECE OF

122
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:07,623
IT.

123
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,724
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THERE

124
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:09,425
SHOULD BE A CONVERSATION WITH

125
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:11,927
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

126
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:12,695
THEY SHOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION

127
00:04:12,695 --> 00:04:13,329
ABOUT THE BEST WAYS TO GO

128
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,931
FORWARD ON THIS.

129
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:18,367
THE IDEA OF THE TEARS ARE USED

130
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,435
BY MORTAR AND HE'S TRYING TO

131
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:20,870
BUILD THEIR.

132
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,472
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

133
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,575
PASSOVER CONVERSATIONS.

134
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:28,043
IN A SECOND HERE, THERE SHOULD

135
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:29,245
BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT YOU

136
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:29,945
DO WITH PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE

137
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:31,981
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.

138
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:34,350
ARE YOU GOING TO APPLY THE LAW

139
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,351
OR NOT APPLY THE LAW?

140
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,085
IF THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO CHANGE

141
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:38,354
POLICY COMMITTEE CAN.

142
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:39,088
IF CONGRESS WANTS TO WORK TO

143
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:42,057
CHANGE THE LAW, YOU CAN.

144
00:04:42,057 --> 00:04:42,758
THE MEETING BETWEEN SCHUMER,

145
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:48,998
PELOSI AND PRESIDENT TRUMP.

146
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:49,732
THIS PRESIDENT WANTS THE WALLET

147
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:53,169
IS GOING TO GET THE FUNDING OR

148
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,403
REALLY THERE'S NOT A MOVEMENT.

149
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:55,137
YOU'RE GOING TO COMPROMISE OR

150
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:59,141
YOU'RE GOING TO GET NOTHING.

151
00:04:59,141 --> 00:04:59,775
YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE WAY

152
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,812
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ON THE

153
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:03,212
SUBJECT.

154
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,848
>> IN 15 THE 22nd, IS IT WORTH

158
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:13,756
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS ARTICULATED

159
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:14,523
WHERE THE FUNDING WILL COME FROM

160
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,592
FOR THE FISCAL CONSERVATIVES.

161
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:20,563
HOW ARE YOU PAYING FOR THE WALL?

162
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:21,197
25 BILLION COULD BE GOING

163
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:27,536
TOWARDS SUPPORTING POOR

164
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:31,740
FAMILIES.

165
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,713
>> I SUPPORT THE TROOPS 100%.
