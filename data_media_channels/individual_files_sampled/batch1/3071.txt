professor thank you very much for joining us thank you for having me tell us what is the standard view of growth on Wall Street the standard view on growth in Wall Street is one growth is always good that's not true bigger is always better that is not true and that companies must grow or die that's not true and lastly public companies should grow continuously and smoothly as evidenced by quarterly earnings and that's the exception not the rule more about how that is a failed model well what it leads to it leads to a short-term mentality and it leads to the creation of what I call non authentic earnings it's almost impossible for companies to grow continuously smoothly on a public company's on a quarterly basis so if you can't do it by creating the old-fashioned earnings earnings the old-fashioned way selling more goods and services to more customers on an arm's-length transaction then you've got to create earnings and that's the whole earnings management game it's what I call non authentic earnings it is fake earnings and you get into the problem that companies create fake earnings earnings which don't represent the underlying substance vitality or strength of the business the business model what customers think about your products and how you're doing my competitors so it it it has a bad effect in that it creates fake earnings which may create an earnings bubble which may create illusory stock market valuations the second thing it does is we know from research that companies in order to meet their quarterly earnings will defer investments in deferred growth investments and that is bad because what we need in this country is real growth and real innovation and we know that real growth and innovation is a complex thing and you can't manage it to the penny every core fair a professor you've just written a book called smart growth building and enduring business by managing the risk of growth one of the first things you say is the financial crisis that brought the economy to its knees is an illustration of what's wrong system what are some examples of past few years that illustrate your thesis well you can you can look in the financial in the financial industry and look at the entire securitisation and the entire excesses that went on from from selling paper right without taking into account the consequences of the risk underlying that paper and so if you want to look at Merrill Lynch Lehman Brothers Washington Mutual in the entire financial area but you can also look outside the financial area and look at public companies big companies that have because of growth they created risk which fundamentally hurt their business model Toyota he's a great example Toyota basically in 2002 changed its strategy from being the best to being the biggest right very very different mindset alright you managed to be the best very differently than managing to be the biggest and what Toyota did was made lots of small changes in order to grow which fundamentally hurt their quality hurt their brand hurt their customer value proposition my model basically says growth has risk which have to be managed you can it is growth is just not like a spigot that you turn on right and and so there's other examples that I give in the book including the problems that Starbucks got into problems JetBlue got in two weeks ever
