>> HE RAN THE CLINTON
INVESTIGATION, HE RUNS THE
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION AND HE
HATES THE PRESIDENT BUT, THE
REPORT SAYS THAT WHILE HIS BIAS
CAST A CLOUD IT DID NOT IMPACT
THE FINAL DECISION, IS THAT
CORRECT?
>> BIASES ALL THE WAY THROUGH
THIS AND I'M SORRY THAT YOU WERE
NOT ABLE TO SEE THAT.
>> IN THIS COUNTRY WE CANNOT
LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE UNELECTED
PEOPLE AT THE FBI GET TO SHELTER
SOMEONE WHO I BELIEVE WAS
ACTIVELY WORKING AGAINST THE
PRESIDENT.
>> WHAT IS MORE TEXTBOOK BIAS
THEN PREJUDGING THIS
INVESTIGATION BEFORE IT'S OVER
AND THIS ONE BEFORE IT BEGINS?
>> Sandra: A MORE FALLOUT
TONIGHT FROM TWO DAYS HEARING ON
THE HILL.
LAWMAKERS GRILLED
INSPECTOR GENERAL
MICHAEL HOROWITZ ON WHY FBI
AGENT PETER STRZOK'S ANTI-TRUMP
BIAS WAS NOT FOUND TO BE AN
INFLUENCE?
AND TONIGHT, STRZOK IS
RESPONDING.
A SHORT TIME AGO HIS LAWYER
RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING IN
PART, QUOTE ALL OF THIS
SERIOUSLY CALLS INTO QUESTION
THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE
DISCIPLINARY PROCESS WHICH NOW
APPEARS TAINTED BY POLITICAL
INFLUENCE.
INSTEAD OF PUBLICLY CALLING FOR
A LONG STATION, POLITICIANS
SHOULD ALLOW THE DISCIPLINARY
PROCESS TO PLAY OUT FREE FROM
POLITICAL PRESSURE.
HERE ARE NOW EXCLUSIVELY,
CONGRESSMAN BOB GOODLATTE AND
TREY GOWDY WHO CHAIRED THE TWO
COMMISSIONS.
THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU AND FOR
YOUR TIME TONIGHT.
CONGRESSMAN GAUDI, I WILL START
WITH YOU FIRST.
I KNOW THAT WAS A FIRST-TIER
HEARING OF PETER STRZOK'S
ATTORNEY AND THAT LETTER
RESPONDING TODAY.
>> I HOPE HE IS SAYS THAT WHEN
HE COMES FROM CONGRESS.
THIS IS THE SAME VICTIM THAT
SAID AS FELLOW CITIZENS, YOU
COULD SMELL THEM.
AND THIS IS THE SAME GUY WHO
SLEPT WALKED THROUGH THE
HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION
AND THEN WOKE UP AND GOT VERY
EXCITED AT THE PROSPECT OF
ENDING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN OR ANY
OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY.
I HOPE TO GOODNESS THAT HE COMES
TO CONGRESS NEXT WEEK AND THAT'S
HIS DEFENSE.
>> Sandra: CONGRESSMAN
GOODLATTE, THAT'S A PRETTY
UNBELIEVABLE STATEMENT THAT SAYS
HE IS THE TARGET OF UNFOUNDED
POLITICAL ATTACKS, POLITICAL
GAINS AND INAPPROPRIATE LEAKS.
>> THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO
QUESTION THAT ALL ACROSS OUR TWO
COMMITTEES, MEMBERS ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE AISLE ACKNOWLEDGED
HOW APPALLED THEY WERE BY THE
STATEMENTS THAT HE MADE.
AND MANY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MAKING
THOSE STATEMENTS USING
GOVERNMENT OFFICES AND
GOVERNMENT EQUIPMENT IS HIGHLY
INAPPROPRIATE.
IT CLEARLY REFLECTED UPON THE
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE TWO
INVESTIGATIONS WERE HIS BIAS
SHOWS THROUGH CLEAR AND CLEAR.
IN ANY EVENT, I AGREE WITH TREY.
HE HAS NOW INDICATED THAT HE
WOULD COME VOLUNTARILY, BUT HE
HAS NOT PINNED HIMSELF DOWN ON
WIND.
SO WE ARE EMINENTLY GOING TO
ISSUE A SUBPOENA FOR HIM TO
APPEAR NEXT WEEK.
SPEED LIMITS OF THE SUBPOENA HAS
BEEN PREPARED BUT HAS NOT BEEN
ISSUED YET?
>> IT'S ON THE WAY.
>> SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE
PETER STRZOK TESTIFY PUBLICLY
NEXT WEEK?
>> WE ARE STILL OPEN TO WORKING
WITH HIM BUT HE HAS TO
UNDERSTAND HE HAS TO DO IT ON
HIS TIMETABLE.
HIS LAWYER BETTER CONTACT US
RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THE SUBPOENA
IS COMING.
>> Sandra: I THINK YOU WILL
HEAR THAT MESSAGE LOUD AND
CLEAR.
YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE
TIMELINE OF THIS TEXT MESSAGES
TODAY.
AND, WHETHER THAT IMPACTED THE
LAUNCH OF THE RUSSIAN
INVESTIGATION, THAT IS THE
QUESTION.
DID IT?
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE
CHRONOLOGY, OF COURSE IN LATE
JULY OF 2016 IS WHEN THE RUSSIA
PROBE BEGAN.
WE WERE NOT EVEN TWO WEEKS INTO
IT.
WE ARE NOT TWO WEEKS INTO IT
BEFORE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ANY
CONCERNS POLICY THAT MAKE SURE
THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NEVER THE
PRESIDENT.
SO KEEP IN MIND, HE IS TWO WEEKS
INTO AN INVESTIGATION AND HE'S
ALREADY TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHING
THE TARGET OF HIS INVESTIGATION.
THEY HADN'T DONE ANYTHING AT
THAT POINT.
IN TWO WEEKS, THE PAPERWORK IS
NOT EVEN PROCESSED.
YET HE IS ALREADY REACHED ITS
CONCLUSION ABOUT WHAT THE
OUTCOME OF THAT INVESTIGATION
IS.
FAST FORWARD TO WHAT HE PUT ON
THE MUELLER PROBE, HE'S TALKING
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND I
HAVE NEVER IN 20 YEARS BEING A
PROSECUTOR SEEN AND
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENT BUT THIS
AMOUNT OF ANIMUS AND BIAS
TOWARDS THE TARGET, AND I HOPE
AND PRAY THAT HE COMES NEXT WEEK
AND PORTRAYS HIMSELF AS A
VICTIM.
>> Sandra: I THINK A LOT OF
PEOPLE AT THIS POINT BASED ON
THAT SET UP ARE GOING TO WANT TO
SEE THAT AS WELL.
AND PETER STRZOK AND HIS ROLE IN
THIS LAUNCH OF THE RUSSIA PROBE,
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WAS
NOT TASKED WITH LOOKING AT.
BUT HE ALSO -- LET'S JUST NOTE,
THAT SAINT PETER             SAY
THAT SAINT PETER             SAP
THAT SAINT PETER             SAT
THAT SAINT PETER             SAR
THAT SAINT PETER             SAS
THAT SAINT PETER             SAO
THAT SAINT PETER             SAK
THAT SAINT PETER             SAW
THAT SAINT PETER             SAS
THAT SAINT PETER             SA'
THAT SAINT PETER             SAT
INVOLVED IN THE HILLARY CLINTON
EMAIL INVESTIGATION, AND AT THE
SAME TIME HE WAS MAKING THE
STATEMENTS THAT TREY JUST
REFERRED TO.
HE WAS ALSO HELPING A PROCESS
THAT BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO NOT
FOLLOW PROPER INVESTIGATIVE
PROCEDURES WITH REGARD TO FORMER
SECRETARY OF STATE AND CANDIDATE
HILLARY CLINTON.
THAT IS A SHOCKING CONTRAST OF
THAT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
OCCURRED IN THE FEDERAL BUREAU
OF INVESTIGATION.
SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 2,020
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OR ANY
OTHER FUTURE INVESTIGATION IS
NOT TAINTED BY THIS KIND OF BIAS
AND NOT TAINTED BY THE
INAPPROPRIATE PROCEDURES.
>> Sandra: ARE YOU HAPPY WITH
THE WAY THINGS WENT TODAY,
CHAIRMAN?
>> I THINK IT WAS A VERY GOOD
HEARING AND MANY PEOPLE BOTH
SIDES OF THE AISLE ARE
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE DECISION
THAT WAS MADE BY PRESIDENT TRUMP
THAT WAS MADE BY PRESIDENT TRUM
PRESIDENT TRUMP, NONE OF THEM
USE HIS NAME IS RECOMMENDED TO
BUY DEPUTY ATTORNEY WAS THE
CORRECT DECISION.
