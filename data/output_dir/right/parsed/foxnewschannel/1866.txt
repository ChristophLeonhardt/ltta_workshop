>> Julie: SHE WILL PRAISE HIM
EVERY DAY FOR THE REST OF HER
LIFE.
>> Bill: GOOD STORY.
>> Julie: SURE IS.
>> WE FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE
OBVIOUS, THAT JERUSALEM IS
ISRAEL'S CAPITAL.
THIS IS NOTHING MORE OR LESS
THAN A RECOGNITION OF REALITY.
>> Julie: PRESIDENT TRUMP SET TO
FULFILL ANOTHER BIG CAMPAIGN
PROMISE THERE.
MAKING GOOD ON A DECADES LONG
PLEDGE WITH NEXT WEEK'S OPENING
OF THE NEW U.S. EMBASSY IN
JERUSALEM.
BUT THE RELOCATION IS CAUSING
QUITE A STIR.
DOUG JOINS US LIVE FROM
WASHINGTON THIS MORNING.
THIS WILL CAP OFF WHAT HAS
ARGUABLY BEEN ONE OF THE MOST
SUCCESSFUL WEEKS OF THE TRUMP
PRESIDENCY TO DATE.
>> JULIE, CERTAINLY A CASE TO BE
MADE FOR THAT ESPECIALLY THOSE
WHO ARE NOT OBSESSED WITH STORMY
DANIELS.
THERE'S THE HOSTAGE RELEASE AND
THE UPCOMING MEETING WITH KIM
JONG UN AND UNEMPLOYMENT AT A
TWO DECADE LOW.
NOW COMES THE EMBASSY WEEK, A
WEEK AFTER TRUMP BACKED OUT OF
WHAT HE CALLED THE FLAWED IRAN
DEAL.
HE PORTRAYS THIS AS A SERIES OF
VICTORIES.
>> NEXT WEEK AFTER THE PROMISES
OF MANY ADMINISTRATIONS AND
PRESIDENTS AND THEN THEY NEVER
DID IT.
THEY CAMPAIGNED, THEY PROMISED,
THEY NEVER DID IT!
NEXT WEEK, WE WILL FINALLY OPEN
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN
JERUSALEM!
>> THE STAKES ARE EXTREMELY
HIGH.
AND THE MOVE FRAUGHT WITH PERIL
WITH IRAN ALREADY BITTER OVER
THE U.S. PULLOUT OF THE JCPOA.
THE ROCKET ATTACKS FROM SYRIA ON
THE GOLAN HEIGHTS THIS WEEK AND
ISRAEL'S RETAILATION FOR THEM IS
A SIGN OF THE HAIR TRIGGER
CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW.
TO THAT POINT, SAUDI ARABIA HAS
ANNOUNCED THAT IF IRAN PROCEEDS
WITH ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS
DEVELOPMENT, SAUDI ARABIA WILL
EMBARK ON ITS OWN NUKE PROGRAM,
POTENTIAL NUCLEAR ESCALATION IN
THE WORLD'S HOTTEST SPOT.
JULIE?
>> Julie: AND THOSE ATTACKS
RAISING QUESTIONS AS WELL, DOUG,
ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE U.S.
DELEGATION ATTENDING THE
EMBASSY'S OPENING.
IS THE PRESIDENT ATTENDING?
>> HE WILL NOT BE.
STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN
HEATHER NOWARD ANNOUNCED WHO
WILL BE GOING.
>> WE ARE PLEASED THAT OUR
DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN
SULLIVAN WILL BE LEADING THE
DELEGATION.
JARED AND IVANKA TRUMP ARE
JOINING THERE AS WELL.
WE'RE VERY PROUD AND PLEASED AT
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ACCOMPLISHMENT
IN DOING THIS.
IT'S SOMETHING HE PROMISED AND
NOW SOMETHING THAT HE IS
FULFILLING.
>> IN ADVANCE OF THE CEREMONY,
ISRAEL'S DEFENSE MINISTER IS
URGING SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR
EL-ASSAD TO FORCE IRANIAN
SOLDIERS OUT OF SYRIA.
THEIR PRESENCE WILL ONLY CAUSE
"PROBLEMS AND DAMAGES".
AND JULIE, YOU KNOW THAT THE
