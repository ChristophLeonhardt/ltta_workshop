we are making America great again you haven't heard that in my view the slogan make America great again is not a recipe for continuing progress only it looks backwards backwards to some golden age and it's been said the main explanation for a golden age is a bad memory in past decades the United States was mired down in multiple Wars we had double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment the elderly were large numbers of them who were destitute millions of people had no health insurance it was no picnic in the old days when despite the problems that we now have also what's gonna make us better off is not kind of zero-sum sports like competition between between nations the problems facing us are many of them are global like rogue nuclear states like climate change in other forms of environmental threats like terrorists like maximizing global wealth and prosperity and none of these are going to be solved if we think of the international arena as one of each nation striving for its individual greatness you can be a proud American or Frenchman or German and a citizen of the world at the same time and so many of the problems facing us are going to require international cooperation but we lived through a period in which nation states competed against each other for glory and preeminence and the results were not pretty they included a couple of world wars since 1945 when we've had institutions of global cooperation the rate of death and war has gone down prosperity has gone up and it's that kind of trend that I think we ought to continue to foster to continue the progress that we have made you are fake dude sir go ahead and you state categorically that nobody know fake news is a real phenomenon there are sleazy predators who cook up completely apocryphal news stories and try to get them circulated on social media and on the internet but it's a a terrible kind of pollution of the language for the president to call any article that criticizes him fake news if you compare the credibility of the president's statements with those of the mainstream media there's just no comparison the president's been called out on lie after lie after lie and as someone who's often written for the so-called mainstream media for all their flaws I know that they got back checkers they won't let me just write anything but that comes into a head I got to prove it so that's kind of standard that that has established the credibility of many of the news media and the basis of democracy is that everyone can be criticized particularly our leaders we don't have a monarch a supreme leader a dictator for life we've got a person who is temporarily in charge of the government and when he makes an error it is mandatory for a free press to call it out to try to delegitimize the press whenever it criticizes the president it's really the the reflexive of an autocrat of a tin-pot dictator in some Banana Republic and not worthy of a democracy like the United States where the president serves at our pleasure and can be criticized just like anyone else you you
