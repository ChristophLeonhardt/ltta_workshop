00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:22,391
IT WAS ABOUT THE FLAG THAT

51
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:25,894

I'M TALKING TO YOUNG VETS.

61
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:45,047

00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:47,216
TOO.

64
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:49,918
AND WHAT IT DOES IS THEY CAN

65
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:50,252
RELATE.

66
00:01:50,252 --> 00:01:51,520
IT HELPS THEM OPEN UP A

67
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,788
LITTLE BIT.

68
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:54,323
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SIGNED

69
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,925
IT WERE FROM ALL

70
00:01:56,925 --> 00:01:57,359
NATIONALITIES.

71
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,162
NO RELIGION, NO GOVERNMENT

72
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,130
AFFILIATION.

73
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,365
JUST SMALL TOWN AMERICA.

74
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:04,967
WHAT THAT FLAG, WHY IT IS SO

75
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:09,405
IMPORTANT TO US, BECAUSE IT

76
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:11,373
WAS JOE'S AND AROUND THE

77
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:12,508
GUYS THAT HE LOVED.

78
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,143
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT IT

79
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:14,843
WAS.

80
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,477
AINSLEY: SO, WHAT HAPPENED

81
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:15,878
TO THE FLAG.

82
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:17,279
>> WE HAVE A MEMORIAL -- AS

83
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,682
A MATTER OF FACT, WE JUST

84
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,750
HAD THE ANNIVERSARY OF

85
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,885
JOE'S -- WHEN HE WAS KILLED

86
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:25,587
SO WE HAVE A MEMORIAL EVERY

87
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:25,888
YEAR.

88
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:27,189
AND LEADING UP TO IT I WAS

89
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,924
LOOKING FOR HIS FLAG -- MY

90
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:30,859
CAR WAS BROKEN INTO BEFORE

91
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,495
THAT, I THOUGHT I BROUGHT IT

92
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:34,530
INTO THE HOUSE.

93
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,132
THEN WE LOOKED INTO --

94
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:38,434
STARTED BECOMING -- MEMORIAL

95
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:39,902
WAS COMING UP AND I STARTED

96
00:02:39,902 --> 00:02:41,336
TO FRANTICALLY LOOKING AND I

97
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:42,638
COULDN'T FIND IT I TOLD MY

98
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:42,971
LIFE.

99
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:44,740
SO WE WENT THROUGH THE

100
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,474
MEMORIAL AFTER THAT.  I KEPT

101
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:47,009
LOOKING AND I SAID OH, NO.

102
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:48,077
IT WAS IN THE TRUCK.

103
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:50,312
BECAUSE THAT DAY WE WERE

104
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:51,680
GOING TO -- I ACTUALLY WAS

105
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,482
GOING TO TAKE IT OUT TO GET

106
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:53,816
FRAMED.

107
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:55,684
I WAS SHOWING ANOTHER VET.

108
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:58,287
AND IT GOT, I BELIEVE IT GOT

109
00:02:58,287 --> 00:02:58,620
STOLEN.

110
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,556
IT MUST HAVE USED IT TO BAG

111
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:04,526
THEIR STUFF UP THAT'S HOW WE

112
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:05,894
LOST IT.

113
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,495
AINSLEY: SEAN, WHEN YOU

114
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:08,230
REALIZED THAT, I'M SURE YOUR

115
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:08,931
HEART SANK.

116
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:10,365
WHAT WERE YOUR EMOTIONS?

117
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:14,803
>> FIRST OFF, I WAS VERY

118
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:15,104
UPSET.

119
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:17,372
I MEAN A RAGE.

120
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:18,073
AND THEN DISAPPOINTMENT

121
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,742
BECAUSE I LOST IT AND THEN

122
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,744
JUST A LAST DITCH EFFORT.

123
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,512
FRIDAY WAS A LAST DITCH

124
00:03:23,512 --> 00:03:24,046
EFFORT.

125
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:26,849

WHERE YOU LIVE AND HOW WE

128
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:30,886
CAN HELP AS VIEWERS.

129
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:33,322
>> WELL, I LIVE IN

130
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:35,324

131
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:40,496

ACUMANDA RESERVATION.

133
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,198
THAT'S WHY I SAID JUST

134
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:43,499
SHARE.

135
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:44,433
IF YOU CAN SHARE AND IT

00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:52,274
YOU CAN DO IT.

140
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,442
JUST HAVE SOMEBODY TURN IT

141
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:53,709

142
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,244
LOOK IN PAWN STORES.

00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:57,579

YOU HAVE THAT MIGHT BE

146
00:04:00,315 --> 00:04:00,616
THERE.

147
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,917
I KNOW IT'S A LAST DITCH

148
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:02,818
EFFORT BUT IT MEANS

149
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:03,519
EVERYTHING TO US.

150
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,853
IT MEANS EVERYTHING TO THE

151
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:07,489
17 THAT WERE KILLED IN THAT

152
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:07,890
DEPLOYMENT.

153
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,725
IT MEANS EVERYTHING TO ALL

154
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:10,759
THOSE 190 THAT WERE WOUNDED

155
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,997
AT THAT TIME.

156
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:16,565
IT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT ME IT

157
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:17,966
TOUCH AS LOT OF PEOPLE.

158
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,101
MY FAMILY AND MARINES THAT

159
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:19,834
SERVED WITH JOE.

160
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:22,271
THEY WOULD LIKE IT BACK.

161
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:23,138
AINSLEY: SEAN, JOE'S STORY

162
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,807
IS TOUCHING TO ALL OF US,

163
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,241
UNFORTUNATELY HIS LIFE WAS

164
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:28,076
CUT SHORT AT 22 YEARS OLD.

165
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:29,378
WHAT DOES HIS SERVICE MEAN

166
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:36,485
TO YOU?

167
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:41,390
>> SACRIFICE.

168
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,792
HE IS BURIED HONORABLY AS A

169
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:44,359
MARINE.

170
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,627
HE WAS WHERE HE WANTED TO

171
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:45,894
BE.

172
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,496
HE WAS SURROUNDED BY THE

173
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,464
LOVED ONES THAT HE WANTED TO

174
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:50,499
BE AROUND.

175
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:54,670
AND WHEN HE DIED, HE WAS

176
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,370
CARRIED BY THE METROPOLITAN

177
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,071
THAT LOVED HIM.

178
00:04:56,071 --> 00:05:00,742
AND SO I THINK HIS SERVICE

179
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:02,077
SHOWS THE LOVE WE HAVE YOU

180
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:03,278
KNOW, THE GUY TO YOUR LEFT,

181
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:08,483
THE GUY TO YOUR RIGHT,.

AINSLEY: A BEAUTIFUL
