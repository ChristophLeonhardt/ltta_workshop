Taco Bell just sent us our new Doritos locos taco but they didn't tell us what flavor it is so we're gonna try the other flavors and see how it stacks up I was expecting more nacho cheese flavor mm I like this one a lot yeah me too so this is the new one oh my god it's really red it's really rustic cheers Cheers I'm not really into cheers I'm good but okay mmm it's got some heat to it kind of sour kind of spicy this is what I kind of wanted from the other ones it has more taste and it lasts with you yeah cuz the other ones are kind of like just a regular crunchy taco where's this one you know that you really can taste like the flavor isn't that the powder and on the chip it's almost like a mix of like chili you know when you get like that prepared chili mix and it's got like cumin and paprika and a couple other things in it a little bit of lime yeah definitely some lime and a little heat to it mm-hmm I think the new flavor is my favorite just because there is that kick given the flavors I think all the reports have been reading across the internet or right and that the next Taco Bell flavor is llamas but this is a classic it's so good yeah I think so yours is I'm gonna say Cool Ranch is number one the new mystery flavor is number two the original is Lynda three for me yeah I'd have to say the new flavor is my number one the Cool Ranch would probably be my number two and then this to me is even below the original
