they are very similar in the sense that
they're both brilliant they're both
combative they're either one is afraid
to take on the media that they appeal to
the forgotten man the silent majority is
a blue collar white Democrat that was
part of the Nixon coalition is now part
of the clump coalition ironically it was
former President Nixon who was to my
mind the very first person who saw the
possibilities of a trump presidency he
met Donald Trump in george
steinbrenner's box in 1987 at the
yankees game and the former president
called me the next morning and said well
i met your man he's really got it this
guy could go all the way
