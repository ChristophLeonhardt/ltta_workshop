1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,120
Alright Dean.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,250
They're sad because they think that

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,380
we don't like them.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,500
It really depends on
how long they've been evolving.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,300
That's an alien.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,160
Aliens have noses?

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,080
There's no right answer, since no
one really knows.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,539
But we often imagine

9
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,990
extraterrestrials to look a certain way,
because we've encountered them in books,

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,860
films, or on TV shows.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,780
Oh my god, it's one of those facehuggers from the Alien movie.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,700
Which means that
when we think about aliens, we're usually

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,420
thinking about the product of someone
else's imagination.

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,640
This is the first

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,600
film featuring life out in space: A Trip
to the Moon by Georges Méliès.

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,899
It came out in 1902 and the strange moon aliens
in it are not at all that strange.

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,900
They actually look a lot like us.

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,600
These creatures were incredibly ambitious at

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,800
the time, but they were also convenient.

20
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,320
This is Charlie Henley, an Oscar-nominated

21
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,030
visual effects supervisor who worked on
Ridley Scott's Alien series. So yeah, he

22
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,260
spends a lot of time thinking about
aliens.

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,160
Obviously sometimes it's just like, well, we'll dress somebody up.

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,280
So they're gonna end up with a head and arms and legs, you know?

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,160
The idea's that they would relate to

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,580
us if they're intelligent, so we'd be kinda
similar.

27
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,299
We don't have any reason to believe that they
would look anything like us. The form of

28
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,970
a human being is the result of several
billion years of evolution. There's no

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,920
reason to believe that the development
of life would be so similar as it was on Earth,

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,240
that the sort of the form of life
would look anything like we have on Earth.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,280
That's Andrew Siemion, the
director of SETI Institute where they

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,240
conduct experiments to detect
extraterrestrial technology.

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,990
We're lucky

34
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,280
in that we don't have to think too much
about the biological organism, the

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,639
specifics of the life that created the
technology, because we just search

36
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,569
directly for the technology and then we
use that

37
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:14,900
a proxy for the existence of life.

38
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,810
But imagining alien organisms, especially

39
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,219
ones with relatable features, is what
feeds a popular theme in science fiction:

40
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,560
the relationship between us and them.

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,980
There's always a point of contact, an

42
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,780
interaction that's sometimes hostile and
other times it leads to a warm and fuzzy relationship.

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,840
And that's made for some
powerful storytelling.

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,220
Are they good or

45
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,300
are they bad?

46
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,800
What would we do if they
try to communicate with us?

47
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,660
I think those are their names.

48
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,600
So what are we gonna call them?

49
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,220
Science fiction has stuck around as a major
Hollywood genre for decades, with more

50
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,939
advanced visual effects technology in
recent years, filmmakers had more room to

51
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,540
experiment with the alien form.

52
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,859
But even with the right tools it can be hard to

53
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,740
break out of what we already know.

54
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,590
Normally there's a bit of a history for the film, there's

55
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,680
some DNA that you want to follow. For
example the Neomorph in the new

56
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,000
Alien is effectively like a new creature that Ridley wanted to create,

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,740
but it had the DNA of the original alien,
so obviously features relate to that.

58
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,519
That connection creates a strong
sense of nostalgia for franchises like

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,320
Alien, but sometimes when creators break
away from that DNA, that leads to new forms.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,340
In The Edge of Tomorrow, there's a
creature called a "Mimic" and we did some

61
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:50,280
design work for that originally.

62
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,329
But the brief for that was it shouldn't be humanistic

63
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:56,140
obviously and it should follow the normal
laws.

64
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,940
And that's a difficult task for filmmakers.

65
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,100
But the challenge with anything like that is that if
it doesn't follow the laws that we know,

66
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,840
They need to come up

67
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,790
with something totally new, but also have
it makes sense to us.

68
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,840
Often, the trick is to find inspiration
in nature.

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,269
For example, the Neomorph, we

70
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,220
referenced these Goblin sharks which
are quite rare, found in the deep sea and

71
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:30,280
they have a particular quality
to the skin, but also just the mechanism

72
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,960
of how their mouths open.

73
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,040
Or the ink-squirting Heptapods in Arrival: they're

74
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,680
otherworldly but still familiar.

75
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,419
And even Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy.

76
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:43,980
Who effectively is an alien, but you know not in any classical sense.

77
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,889
Like he was kind of made...

78
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,920
like he's made out of a tree.

79
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,169
The design brief there is to make him

80
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,040
friendly, but also figure out the
technicalities of how it's gonna work.

81
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,820
These aliens come from someone else's
imagination and they might not be

82
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,449
entirely rooted in science, but the
depictions make us think about life

83
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:06,140
beyond our planet.

84
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,180
We're all sort
of wondering about the same thing.

85
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,630
And I think some people draw pictures of
it and some people make movies about it

86
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,160
and some people make music about it

87
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,410
and some people talk to their friends and

88
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,419
family and some scientists try to
determine the answer using the

89
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:27,340
principles of basic science and
observational astronomy, but it's all

90
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,720
part of I think the same human question.

91
00:05:30,720 --> 00:00:00,000
Which is of course:
