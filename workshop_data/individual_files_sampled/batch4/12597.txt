do you think it's possible to build a competitor something like a YouTube or Facebook considering the market share dominance that these companies actually have what do we do about this cuz again you had a conversation with Thomas soul that was automatically demonetised with Thomas soul yeah I don't even know how that's humanly possible Ben as a guy in a yarmulke you know the story of David versus Goliath I've sort of become Dave verse YouTube I mean i-i've been one of the most outspoken people on this because it's impossible to tell what's going on if let's say they just had a clear one pager this is what we monetize this is what we don't this is our policy well ice nobody forced me to be on YouTube I'm voluntarily there they don't have to monetize anything but they I truly I mean I tweet this all the time they can do whatever they want the only reason I'm screaming about it all the time is I can only use my voice to influence things I don't want government involvement the idea that the government but the United States government is gonna somehow regulate a tech company properly is bananas it's completely don't even own a computer is amin if you watch that here on with zuckerberg it was just like i don't know what is the facebook is it a book full of faces then i just paid my property taxes you know a month ago on a government website it looked like he was a AOL from 1996 they the idea that these people can do this or that middle management regulators can figure out it makes you hate taxes anymore because i think all your money all these crappy websites but yeah the hour that i lost in my life just watching the things like dial-up prodigy like ridiculous so the idea that the government can do it is not the answer to me what i think we can do and i think you're doing it too is we can influence them by leveraging our audience to know what's going on it's the lack of transparency that's the problem and it's also look the only reason I keep making such a big noise about it is because things like Thomas all things like Ben Shapiro I mean it's it's all over the board and by the way you know there's this idea out there that this is only they're only attacking conservatives or they're only attacking people that are thought of as more right or whatever I am or whatever I don't know that that's the case I genuinely have no idea what's going on but I will consistently use my voice because that's what you're supposed to do as a citizen I'm not asking the government and yes do I think competition can come in yes now the one counter-argument to this and I think it's a legit one and I think for our friends at Prager University to view this a little differently than us is that Google which owns YouTube obviously controls so much information has so much power now that it is possible that by default that competition can never really arise against them now I actually don't take that position but I think there's an interesting argument to be had there I believe they'll they'll ultimately crumble under the weight of their own nonsense if you're gonna say well and we know this because of the d'amour lawsuit well we're not gonna hire white or Asian engineers guess what you're gonna start getting not the best engineers and that's not a knock on any ones ethnicity or anything but you should be hiring it's really standard as merit it's different than if that is not your only standard precisely so yeah so they will crumble on their own and if we have to push them a little bit so that ultimately something else can arise then then so be it but I would be look if they if tomorrow it all gets fixed every time I email them I'm like guys I want this to work yank I'm enjoying this but I assure you every time we see the demonetised thing and we request from you and one of my guys tells me I mean I'm not gonna repeat cuz I know this family show what I usually say at first but then I'm like I mean I got to do it again and then I got to take the screen shot and I got a tweet it's like this is not what I want to put out a show yeah get people to check it out let the ideas fall that where they may and then move on but no I don't think the government is the answer and I think what you're doing what I'm doing what Phil DeFranco is doing and Rogan and the rest is the answer keep putting out good stuff and force them to do the right
