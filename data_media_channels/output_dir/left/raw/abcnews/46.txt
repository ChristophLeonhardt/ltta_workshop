3
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:14,747

NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 

5
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:17,383
STEPHANOPOULOS. 

6
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:17,816
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.

7
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:19,152
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR WITH 

8
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,153
NEWS FROM WALL STREET.

9
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,921
WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE FLOOR OF

10
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,022
THE STOCK EXCHANGE.

11
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,557
THE DOW DOWN MORE THAN 1,000 

12
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:26,526
POINTS COMING ON TOP OF A MORE 

13
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,261
THAN 600 POINT LOSS ON FRIDAY.

14
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,663
THAT PUTS THE DOW DOW IN NEGATI 

15
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,031
TERRITORY FOR THIS YEAR, DOWN A 

16
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,901
LITTLE MORE THAN 4% RIGHT NOW.

17
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,837
OF COURSE THIS COMES ON TOP OF A

18
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:38,404
HEALTHY GAIN IN THE STOCK 

19
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:40,440
EXCHANGE OVER THE LAST YEAR.

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,542
IT YOU LOOK BACK TO WHEN 

21
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,476
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS INAUGURATED 

22
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,778
IN JANUARY 2017 THE DOW BELOW 

23
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:48,081
20,000 NOW ABOUT 24,000, SO 

24
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,384
CLOSE TO A 25% RISE SINCE 2017.

25
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,486
BUT IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH DAY ON 

26
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,821
WALL STREET RIGHT NOW AS WE 

27
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,155
APPROACH THE CLOSING BELL, THE 

28
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:59,292
DOW CONTINUES TO DROP, NOW DOWN 

29
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,726
ABOUT 1100 POINTS.

30
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:03,062
I'M HERE WITH OUR CHIEF BUSINESS

31
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:03,395
CORRESPONDENT.

32
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:04,629
THIS WOULD BE THE LARGEST POINT 

33
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,232
DROP EVER IN DOW HISTORY BUT FAR

34
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:06,899
FROM THE WORST DAY. 

35
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:07,634
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

36
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,635
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS IN POINT 

37
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:11,337
TERMS WE WILL CLOSE SOMEWHERE 

38
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:15,108
DOWN ABOUT 1100 POINTS TODAY.

39
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,242
THAT'S SIZABLE BUT NOWHERE NEAR 

40
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,145
AS BAD AS IT WAS SEPTEMBER 9th, 

41
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:22,482
2008, WHEN THE DOW FELL 777 

42
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,884
POINTS, A NEAR 7% FALL THAT DAY.

43
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,185
WE'VE JUST COME A LOT FARTHER 

44
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:27,320
SINCE THEN.

45
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,821
THAT'S WHY THE PERCENTAGE TERMS 

46
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:30,690
TODAY ARE STILL DOWN 4.6% BUT 

47
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,724
NOT AS BAD AS THEN. 

48
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:35,395
>> THE FAMOUS BLACK MONDAY IN 

49
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,128
1987 WHERE THE DOW DROPPED MORE 

50
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:36,795
THAN 20%.

51
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:39,299
AT ONE POINT THE DOW WAS DOWN 

52
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,166
1600 POINTS, EVEN WORSE. 

53
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,135
>> IT WAS LOOKING LIKE WE COULD 

54
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,635
BE IN THAT NEGATIVE 7% TERRITORY

55
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:45,237
SO WE'VE COME UP FROM THERE.

56
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:46,772
BUT GEORGE, AS WE WERE SPEAKING 

57
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:47,673
ABOUT EARLIER THERE WERE A 

58
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:49,576
NUMBER OF VETERANS ON WALL 

59
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,344
STREET WHO HAVE BEEN FEELING 

60
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,645
LIKE SOMETHING IS COMING, THAT 

61
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,213
THIS IS MEANT TO BE, THAT 

62
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:55,347
SOMETHING -- WE WERE GOING TO 

63
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:57,483
SEE A SELL-OFF LIKE THIS AT SOME

64
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:58,985
POINT IN TIME GIVEN HOW FAR 

65
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,687
STOCKS HAVE COME IN THE LAST 

66
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,021
YEAR, UP 22% IN THE LAST YEAR. 

67
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:02,655
>> RIGHT.

68
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,590
BUT THE ECONOMY STILL QUITE 

69
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:04,958
STRONG.

70
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,327
>> THE JOBS REPORT ON FRIDAY, 

71
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,596
200,000 JOBS WERE ADDED, THE 

72
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,830
WAGE GAINS ARE HAPPENING AND 

73
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,898
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE WAITING ON, 

74
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:14,299
THOSE WAGE GAINS AND SOME OF 

75
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:15,368
THAT ACTUALLY CAN HAVE A 

76
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,936
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THIS MARKET 

77
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,839
BECAUSE AS WAGES AND JOBS 

78
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,706
IMPROVE, IT GIVES MORE REASON 

79
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,374
FOR THE FED TO HIKE INTEREST 

80
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:23,977
RATES WHICH CAN WEIGH ON STOCKS.

81
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,079
>> WE'VE HAD THE CLOSING BELL.

82
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,381
DOWN ABOUT 1178 POINTS.

83
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,416
IT WILL SETTLE A FEW MORE 

84
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:30,917
MINUTES.

85
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,986
MORE THAN 4% LOSS ON TOP OF A 

86
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,220
600 POINT DROP ON FRIDAY.

87
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,821
THAT HAS WIPED OUT THE GAINS IN 

88
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,623
THE DOW FOR THE YEAR.

89
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:39,825
REBECCA WILL BE JOINING DAVID
