joining me now is Bob Bauer who was white House Counsel to President Obama Bob good to see you let's let's touch let's start there talk about whether or not Muller could potentially use this as evidence of Donald Trump trying to obstruct the case there's a lot of disagreement over whether or not this amounts to obstruction what is your take I agree with miss Roca that it is certainly evidence that something could be afoot and that would have to be pursued I do not agree with some who argue that because he's talked about the exercise of the parking power he's completely exempted from any investigation into intent I think that's incorrect I think that with appropriate evidence the president's use of the pardon power to obstruct an investigation is potentially an indictable offense of violation of the criminal laws is it is it out of the ordinary too as to have somebody a personal lawyer for the president asked about pardons would Don Magan be asking about pardons and normal and normal circumstances as Miriam was just saying in neither case I don't think either the White House Counsel or a personal lawyer should have been raising the question of the presidential pardons with witnesses in an inquiry that directly touched the president I don't think in either case it would have been appropriate imprudent is frankly a mild way of putting it I think it's fraught with legal consequences how much does Donald Trump's own words factored in during the time that the Washington Post The New York Times are reporting these conversations were happening with Michael Flynn's lawyer this conversation was happening Donald Trump was on the White House lawn as you just saw in that video talking about whether or not he would use a part in bringing up the term pardon there was reporting that he had been asking his aides and his counselors what his pardon power was how much of that is going to end up factoring into weighing a conversation that doubt might have had with the lawyers from an important gates once again it creates a context that bares additional investigation the timing of the president's remarks with mr. doubts approach to the witnesses and his apparent mention of the pardon power will only encourage the investigators to determine whether he was in fact authorizing an approach in which he was offering up the pardons as a postal potentially inducement to these witnesses not to give truthful testimony about the president's actions so I do think and we've seen this before in other political context it is not without consequence what the president says in public it's not without consequence what he says by Twitter it's not without consequence what he says as he walks across the White House lawn or in the White House press briefing room anywhere and I think if he mistaken to believe otherwise is it advisable though for a president to issue any sort of pardon in an investigation that concerns himself no I think that's the fundamental question that's going to potentially be addressed in this case depending on how the president ultimately behaves whether he decides to grant a pardon or not and that is whether or not the pardon power can be construed to permit a president to exercise it for the purpose of saving himself I think it's fair to say that's not how the founders conceived of the part in power I think the pardon power is absolute in certain respects I think it protects the beneficiary of the pardon but I don't believe that for a corrupt purpose it protects the president baum do you think the president has obstructed justice I don't know I certainly think the president's put himself in a position where that question could be raised there's plenty to use that metaphor that's constantly overworked there's plenty of smoke and I think people's eyes are beginning to burn can the president obstruct justice there are arguments out there that the President himself cannot the White House argues that the president certainly can obstruct justice and one of the questions again that's been raised is can the president obstruct justice or can he for example say that it's his constitutional right to dismiss any subordinate officer for any purpose and nobody can inquire into his motive I think that's flatly wrong I think the president obviously has wide authority to dismiss subordinate officers but I believe that in the case that there's corrupt intent and he is acting in a fashion to protect himself I believe that his motive can be inquired into and I believe he can be exposed to obstruction charges and I also believe and I think it is the better view of the law that he could be indicted while in office what do you think of the team that the president has assembled around John Dowd is gone there's now jay sekulow there's an attorney that we had been working with jay sekulow now working on Donald Trump's team needs a criminal lawyer in New York not a DC lawyer are these the people that are going to be able to adequately protect the president from this investigation if it needs if they need to certainly the President had an opportunity to be represented by individuals with more experience and it hasn't worked out that way for him I don't want to speak to the capabilities of any of these lawyers except to say that none of them are really known at this point to have the sort of backgrounds that are most helpful to a president in this situation so what I view the president's legal team to be ideal from my perspective you know built up with the sorts of people who can give him the advice that he needs know I sort fall there to be sure now on the other hand I suppose somebody could say the president not having recently fired them or interviewed replacements behind their backs they at least have the virtue of being able to get along with their client quick question historical question have you ever heard of any other president thinking about pardoning somebody in order to protect themselves I don't know whether by the way the Watergate transcripts reflect any discussion by Richard Nixon with any of his associations associates about that possibility so I if I had to look some place to see whether there was any hint of that much less a plot that's where I would look first Bob Bauer Bob good to see you thank you very much hey there I'm Chris Hayes
