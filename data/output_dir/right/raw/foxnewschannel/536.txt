CAPACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE

26

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

27
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:23,210
IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO BE HERE

28
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,345
TODAY AT THIS U.N. SECURITY

29
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:29,283
COUNCIL BRIEFING TO DISCUSS A

30
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:31,919
MATTER OF URGENT IMPORTANCE

31
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:34,721
CONCERNING AND COUNTERING THE

32
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:37,524
PROLIFERATION OF DEADLY

33
00:01:37,524 --> 00:01:38,459
CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, AND

34
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:41,628
NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AND THE MEANS

35
00:01:41,628 --> 00:01:42,563
TO DELIVER THEM.

36
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:46,300
THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD HAVE

37
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,469
LONG RECOGNIZED THAT CERTAIN

38
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:51,038
WEAPONS ARE SO DANGEROUS AND

39
00:01:51,038 --> 00:01:52,172
CAN INFLICT SO MUCH SUFFERING

40
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:54,808
THAT ALL OF US HAVE A VITAL

41
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:57,678
INTEREST IN PREVENTING THEIR

42
00:01:57,678 --> 00:02:01,081
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT, SPREAD,

43
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:01,415
AND USE.

44
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:03,183
SINCE MY INAUGURATION, THE

45
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:05,319
UNITED STATES HAS TAKEN BOLD

46
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,722
ACTION TO CONFRONT THESE

47
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:10,124
SINISTER THREATS.

48
00:02:10,124 --> 00:02:13,327
MANY OF US ARE RIGHTLY FOCUSED

49
00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:15,429
ON THE DANGERS OF NUCLEAR

50
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:18,198
WEAPONS, BUT WE MUST NEVER

51
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:20,868
FORGET THE RISK POSED BY

52
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:22,403
BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

53
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:25,272
THE UNITED STATES WAS ONE OF

54
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:29,343
THE FIRST NATIONS TO

55
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:31,212
UNILATERALLY RENOUNCE THE USE

56
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:33,848
OF BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS AND SINCE

57
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:36,884
WORLD WAR I WE HAVE LED

58
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:38,519
INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS AGAINST

59
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,754
THE SCOURGE OF CHEMICAL WARFARE.

60
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:44,125
MOST RECENTLY IN SYRIA, WE HAVE

61
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,726
TWICE IMPOSED SEVERE

62
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:48,329
CONSEQUENCES ON THE ASSAD

63
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:50,831
REGIME FOR USING CHEMICAL

64
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:53,034
WEAPONS AGAINST INNOCENT

65
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:53,401
CIVILIANS.

66
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:58,706
I WANT TO THANK PRIME MINISTER

67
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:04,979
MAY AND PRESIDENT MACRON FOR

68
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,315
THEIR COUNTRIES CLOSE

69
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:08,749
PARTNERSHIP LAST APRIL.

70
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:10,851
THE SYRIANS ARE ENABLED BY

71
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:13,187
RUSSIA AND IRAN.

72
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:14,956
THE IRANIAN REGIME EXPORTS

73
00:03:14,956 --> 00:03:19,928
VIOLENCE, TERROR AND TURMOIL.

74
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:21,095
IT ILLICITLY PROCURES SENSITIVE

75
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:23,831
ITEMS TO ADVANCE ITS BALLISTIC

76
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:26,534
MISSILE PROGRAM AND

77
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:27,869
PROLIFERATES THESE MISSILES ALL

78
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:30,138
ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST.

79
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:32,707
THE REGIME IS THE WORLD'S

80
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:34,809
LEADING SPONSOR OF TERROR AND

81
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:36,311
FUELS CONFLICT ACROSS THE

82
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:40,048
REGION AND FAR BEYOND.

83
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:41,916
A REGIME WITH THIS TRACK RECORD

84
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,485
MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO

85
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:46,187
POSSESS A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

86
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:48,523
FOR THIS REASON, I ANNOUNCED

87
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:49,924
EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT THE

88
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:53,161
UNITED STATES WOULD WITHDRAW

89
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:56,497
FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

90
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:58,132
THIS HORRIBLE ONE-SIDED DEAL

91
00:03:58,132 --> 00:04:01,035
ALLOWED IRAN TO CONTINUE ITS

92
00:04:01,035 --> 00:04:04,105
PATH TOWARDS A BOMB AND GAVE

93
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:06,174
THE REGIME A CASH LIFELINE WHEN

94
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:08,276
THEY NEEDED IT THE MOST.

95
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:12,080
THEY WERE IN BIG, BIG TROUBLE.

96
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,047
THEY NEEDED CASH.

97
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:15,517
WE GAVE IT TO THEM.

98
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:18,987
IN THE YEARS SINCE THE DEAL WAS

99
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:21,623
SIGNED, IRAN'S AGGRESSION ONLY

100
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:21,990
INCREASED.

101
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,392
THE REGIME USED NEW FUNDS FROM

102
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:27,662
THE DEAL TO SUPPORT TERRORISM,

103
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:31,666
BUILD NUCLEAR CAPABLE MISSILES,

104
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,934
AND FOMENT CHAOS.

105
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,703
FOLLOWING AMERICA'S WITHDRAWAL,

106
00:04:34,703 --> 00:04:39,007
THE UNITED STATES BEGAN

107
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:39,941
REIMPOSING NUCLEAR-RELATED

108
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:42,143
SANCTIONS ON IRAN.

109
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:42,777
ALL U.S. NUCLEAR-RELATED

110
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:46,648
SANCTIONS WILL BE IN FULL FORCE

111
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:47,816
BY EARLY NOVEMBER.

112
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:50,886
THEY WILL BE IN FULL FORCE.

113
00:04:50,886 --> 00:04:54,589
AFTER THAT, THE UNITED STATES

114
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:56,491
WILL PURSUE ADDITIONAL

115
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:58,126
SANCTIONS, TOUGHER THAN EVER

116
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:01,229
BEFORE, TO COUNTER THE ENTIRE

117
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:02,864
RANGE OF IRAN'S MALIGNED

118
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:03,198
CONDUCT.

119
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:04,499
ANY INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY WHO

120
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:07,602
FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THESE

121
00:05:07,602 --> 00:05:09,237
SANCTIONS WILL FACE SEVERE

122
00:05:09,237 --> 00:05:09,671
CONSEQUENCES.

123
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:11,139
I ASK ALL MEMBERS OF THE

124
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:14,042
SECURITY COUNCIL TO WORK WITH

125
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:17,345
THE UNITED STATES TO INSURE THE

126
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:20,048
IRANIAN REGIME CHANGES ITS

127
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:23,351
BEHAVIOR AND NEVER ACQUIRES A

128
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:23,919
NUCLEAR BOMB.

129
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,989
WITH ALL OF THIS SAID, I WANT

130
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:30,559
TO THANK IRAN, RUSSIA, AND

131
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:34,396
SYRIA FOR AT MY VERY STRONG

132
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:35,797
URGING AND REQUEST

133
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:36,999
SUBSTANTIALLY SLOWING DOWN

134
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:41,537
THEIR ATTACK ON IDLIB PROVINCE

135
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:42,971
AND THE 3 MILLION PEOPLE WHO

136
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:47,643
LIVE THERE IN ORDER TO GET

137
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:48,544
35,000 TARGETED TERRORISTS.

138
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:51,813
GET THE TERRORISTS, BUT I HOPE

139
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:53,415
THE RESTRAINT CONTINUES.

140
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:56,452
THE WORLD IS WATCHING.

141
00:05:56,452 --> 00:06:00,155
THANK YOU ALSO TO TURKEY FOR

142
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:02,124
HELPING TO NEGOTIATE RESTRAINT.

143
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:04,226
ANYTHING THE USA CAN DO TO HELP

144
00:06:04,226 --> 00:06:06,562
RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN ORDER

145
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:09,465
TO SAVE PERHAPS EVEN HUNDREDS

146
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:12,801
OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES, MAYBE

147
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:15,904
MORE, WE ARE WILLING AND ABLE.

148
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:19,008
WE ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP.

149
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:23,179
IN MY REMARKS YESTERDAY TO THE

150
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:24,079
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY

151
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,182
I LAID OUT MY ADMINISTRATION'S

152
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:28,717
COMMITMENT TO BUILDING A MORE

153
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:32,188
JUST AND PEACEFUL FUTURE.

154
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:33,556
REGRETTABLY, WE FOUND THAT

155
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:37,560
CHINA HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO

156
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,031
INTERFERE IN OUR UPCOMING 2018

157
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:42,398
ELECTION.

158
00:06:42,398 --> 00:06:45,267
COMING UP IN NOVEMBER.

159
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:46,936
AGAINST MY ADMINISTRATION.

160
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:50,005
THEY DO NOT WANT ME OR US TO

161
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:53,142
WIN BECAUSE I AM THE FIRST

162
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:55,611
PRESIDENT EVER TO CHALLENGE

163
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,046
CHINA ON TRADE.

164
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:59,382
AND WE ARE WINNING ON TRADE.

165
00:06:59,382 --> 00:07:02,919
WE ARE WINNING AT EVERY LEVEL.

166
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,857
WE DON'T WANT THEM TO MEDDLE OR

167
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:09,725
INTERFERE IN OUR UPCOMING

168
00:07:09,725 --> 00:07:10,893
ELECTION.

169
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:12,061
AS I ALSO MENTIONED YESTERDAY,

170
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:14,397
WE HAVE SEEN THE RESULTS OF

171
00:07:14,397 --> 00:07:17,233
HISTORIC EFFORTS TO OPEN NEW

172
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:21,470
PATHWAYS TO PEACE ON THE NORTH

173
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,241
KOREAN PENINSULA, ON THE KOREAN

174
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:26,642
PENINSULA, AND IT'S SOMETHING

175
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:28,077
WE ARE EXTREMELY PROUD OF.

176
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:31,213
I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT NORTH

177
00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:34,150
KOREA HAS NOT CONDUCTED A

178
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,551
MISSILE TEST SINCE LAST

179
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:35,918
NOVEMBER.

180
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:38,488
IT HAS NOT CONDUCTED A NUCLEAR

181
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:41,457
TEST SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER.

182
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:44,160
AND THE HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN

183
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,729
RETURNED TO US AND VERY

184
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:50,166
IMPORTANTLY THE REMAINS OF

185
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,602
AMERICAN HEROES ARE NOW

186
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:53,069
RETURNING HOME.

187
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,872
IN JUNE I HELD A HISTORIC

188
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:57,740
SUMMIT WITH CHAIRMAN KIM

189
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,843
JONG-UN IN SINGAPORE WHERE HE

190
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:03,980
REAFFIRMS HIS COMMITMENT TO

191
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,615
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION.

192
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:07,283
LAST WEEK CHAIRMAN KIM

193
00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:09,719
REITERATED THAT COMMITMENT TO

194
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:11,354
PRESIDENT MOON AT THEIR THIRD

195
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:11,821
SUMMIT.

196
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:15,658
AND TO ME IN A VERY STRONG

197
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:16,359
LETTER FORM.

198
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:20,530
I THINK WE WILL MAKE A DEAL BUT

199
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,165
UNFORTUNATELY TO INSURE THIS

200
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:25,201
PROGRESS CONTINUES, WE MUST

201
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:31,241
ENFORCE EXISTING U.N. SECURITY

202
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:33,710
COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS UNTIL

203
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,644
DENUCLEARIZATION OCCURS.

204
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:37,480
HOWEVER, WE HAVE DETECTED THAT

205
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,749
SOME NATIONS ARE ALREADY

206
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:42,686
VIOLATING THESE U.N. SANCTIONS.

207
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:45,021
THIS INCLUDES ILLEGAL SHIP TO

208
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:47,891
SHIP TRANSFERS WHICH MUST END

209
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:48,825
IMMEDIATELY.

210
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:50,727
THE SAFETY OF THE KOREAN

211
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:52,829
PENINSULA, THE REGION, AND THE

212
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:55,499
WORLD DEPENDS ON FULL

213
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:59,369
COMPLIANCE WITH U.N. SECURITY

214
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:00,303
COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS.

215
00:09:00,303 --> 00:09:01,204
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.

216
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:04,307
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I BELIEVE

217
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:05,509
THAT CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-UN, A

218
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:09,012
MAN I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW AND

219
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:10,714
LIKE, WANTS PEACE AND

220
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:12,516
PROSPERITY FOR NORTH KOREA.

221
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:13,617
MANY THINGS ARE HAPPENING

222
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:16,720
BEHIND THE SCENES AWAY FROM THE

223
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,624
MEDIA WHICH NOBODY KNOWS.

224
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:21,825
BUT THEY ARE HAPPENING

225
00:09:21,825 --> 00:09:22,759
NEVERTHELESS AND THEY'RE

226
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,262
HAPPENING IN A VERY POSITIVE

227
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:25,529
WAY.

228
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,298
SO I THINK YOU WILL HAVE SOME

229
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:29,933
VERY GOOD NEWS COMING FROM

230
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:33,036
NORTH KOREA IN THE COMING

231
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:34,404
MONTHS AND YEARS.

232
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:36,239
I ALSO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE

233
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:37,941
WHAT PRESIDENT MOON OF SOUTH

234
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:43,113

EACH OF US FOLLOWS IN THE

243
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:08,372
FOOTSTEPS OF COUNTLESS WORLD

00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:17,247
NOBEL GOAL.

TO BUILD A FUTURE WORTHY OF THE

00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:26,857
NATION AND FOR OUR FUTURE.

00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:30,293
TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE NEED A
