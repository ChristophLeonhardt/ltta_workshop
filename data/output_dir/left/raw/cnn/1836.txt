1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310
I was just handed three pages worth of a
statement from former President Barack

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,330
Obama so I'm just gonna sit here and
read every single word of this to all of

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,519
you this is what we just got from
President Obama

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,990
he writes immigration can be a
controversial topic we all want safe

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,070
secure borders and a dynamic economy and
people of goodwill can have legitimate

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,039
disagreements about how to fix our
immigration system so that everybody

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,019
plays by the rules but that's not what
the action that the White House took

8
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,668
today is about this is about young
people who grew up in America kids who

9
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,140
study in our schools young adults who
are starting careers Patriots who pledge

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,300
allegiance to our flag these dreamers
are Americans in their hearts in their

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,180
minds in every single way but one on
paper they were brought to this country

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,379
by their parents sometimes even as
infants they may not know a country

13
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,600
besides ours they may not even know a
language besides English they often have

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,910
no idea they are undocumented until they
apply for a job or college or driver's

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,439
license over the years politicians of
both parties have worked together to

16
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,939
write legislation that would have told
these young people our young people he

17
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,049
writes that if your parents brought you
here as a child if you've been here a

18
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,259
certain number of years and if you're
willing to go to college or serve in our

19
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,939
military then you'll get a chance to
stay and earn your citizenship and for

20
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,009
years while I was president I asked
Congress to send me such a bill that

21
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,549
bill never came and because it made no
sense to expel talented driven patriotic

22
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,290
young people from the only country they
know solely because of the actions of

23
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,759
their parents my administration acted to
lift the shadow of deportation from

24
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,570
these young people so that they could
continue to contribute to our

25
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,579
communities and to our country we did so
based on the well established legal

26
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,990
principle of prosecutorial discretion
deployed by Democratic and Republican

27
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,890
presidents alike because our immigration
enforcement agencies have limited

28
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,969
resources and it makes sense to focus
those resources on those who come

29
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,520
illegally to this country to do us harm
deportation of criminals went up some

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,180
800,000 young people step forward met
rigorous requirements and went through

31
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,670
background checks in America grew
stronger as a result but today that

32
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,750
shadow has been cast over some of our
best and brightest young people once

33
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,760
again to target these people is wrong
because they have done nothing wrong

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,700
it is self-defeating because they want
to start new businesses staff our labs

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,360
serve in our military and otherwise
contribute to a country we love

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,560
and President Obama writes it is cruel
what if our kids science teacher or our

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,970
friendly neighbor turns out to be a
dreamer where are we supposed to send

38
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,420
her to a country she doesn't know a
--remember with a language she may not

39
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,910
even speak let's be clear the action
taken today isn't legally required it's

40
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,780
a political decision and a moral
question whatever concerns or complaints

41
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,739
Americans may have about our immigration
in general we shouldn't threaten the

42
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,209
future of this group of young people who
are here through no fault of their own

43
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:19,320
who pose no threat who are not taking
away anything from the rest of us they

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,760
are that picture on our kids softball
team that first responder who helps out

45
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,560
his community after a disaster that
cadet in ROTC who wants nothing more

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,370
than to wear the uniform of the country
that gave him a chance

47
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,269
kicking them out won't lower the
unemployment rate or lighten anyone's

48
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,370
taxes or raise anybody's wages it is
precisely because this action is

49
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,360
contrary to our spirit and to common
sense that business leaders faith

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,530
leaders economists and Americans of all
political stripes called on the

51
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,540
administration not to do what it did
today and now that the White House has

52
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,019
shifted its responsibility for these
young people to Congress it is up to

53
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,760
members of Congress to protect these
young people in our future I'm heartened

54
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,510
by those who've suggested that they
should and I joined my voice with the

55
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,590
majority of Americans who hope they step
up and do it with a sense of moral

56
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,620
urgency that matches the urgency these
young people feel ultimately this is

57
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,478
about basic decency last two graphs here
this is about whether we are a people

58
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,560
who kick hopeful young strivers out of
america or whether we treat them the way

59
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,040
we want our own kids to be treated
it's about who we are as a people and

60
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,740
who we want to be he closes with with
this what makes us American is not a

61
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,040
question of what we look like or where
our names come from or the way we pray

62
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,020
what makes us American is our fidelity
to a set of ideals that all of us are

63
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,880
created equal that all of us deserve the
chance to make of Our Lives what we will

64
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,340
that all of us share an obligation to
stand up to speak out and secure our

65
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,360
most cherished values for the next
generation that is how America has

66
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,950
traveled this far that is how if we keep
at it we will ultimately reach that more

67
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:08,260
perfect union and that is the statement
from President Barack Obama in its
