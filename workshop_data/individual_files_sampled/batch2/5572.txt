day 434 of the Trump administration the president is at mar-a-lago in Florida tonight the 137th day of his presidency spent at a trump branded property he will spend the long Easter weekend there leaving behind a less than rock-solid situation in his West Wing where today he said goodbye to his departing communications director hope Hicks Jonathan Lemire of The Associated Press who is standing by to join us tonight puts it this way quote Hicks was more accurately described by White House officials as Trump's right-hand woman and media gatekeeper providing needed doses of affirmation to the President and able to deliver bad news to him with few repercussions this month alone we have seen four critical senior staff members to part the administration as the president continues to remake his cabinet among other things which brings us to John Kelly Bloomberg reporting's and I quote White House chief of staff John Kelly has lost some of his clout and wasn't at President Donald Trump's side for crucial decisions on staffing and policy moves according to several senior aides Kelly wasn't with the president last week when Trump abruptly decided to oust Asia HR McMaster as National Security Advisor and replace him with John Bolton last week when Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin President Vladimir Putin Kelly wasn't on the call even as the president appears to be running the White House without Kelly's input Trump has recently made a point of publicly praising his chief of staff which as you know can also be the kiss of death we have general Kelly here for Starr and he's doing a great job in Washington I think he likes what you do better than what he does but he's doing a great job amid the chaos there is more talk about something that's been discussed on this broadcast among others and that is defense secretary mattis remains on the job while the original band of brothers the generals that Trump hired have diminished around him there's been speculation that mattis does not welcome and may not get along with the new neocon national security advisor and longtime hawk John Bolton so it was fun and interesting to overhear the man known in Washington speak as the SEC def greet Bolton today outside the Pentagon for the first time to say thank you for oh no thanks for uh thanks for coming and as for the president after a nearly week-long disappearance from any public setting he got to cut loose a bit before a union audience today in Ohio we're now finally putting America first just this week we secured a wonderful deal with South Korea I may hold it up till after a deal is made with North Korea we're launching the next phase of America's economic comeback we're going to rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure they don't like the winds we've been getting they don't like that the economy the Democrats they don't like that the economy is so strong I have made some changes because I wasn't happy with the speed with which our veterans were taken care of we need walls we started building our wall and we're getting that sucker built there's a revolution going on out there even look at Rosa and I called her yesterday look at her ratings look at her rating on that note let's bring in our leadoff panel for another Thursday night shall we the aforementioned Jonathan Lemire White House reporter for The Associated Press at an MSNBC political analyst Philip bumps back with US national correspondent for the Washington Post and Jackie Calmes returns to the broadcast White House editor for the LA Times okay mr. Lemire since we started with you we know where the head of the Trump administration is tonight where is the heart especially on this day when hope Hicks left his orbit other than Keith Schiller his bodyguard who was with them the duration the entire length of the campaign this is the closest person to him that's right I mean Keith Schiller dates years before the campaign but Hope Hicks is one of the original aides but even before there was a campaign in the early months of 2015 she was on board and do today she saw was it she got a gracious exit from the White House the footage there of the handshake and the kiss on the cheek the president brought her out in front of the Oval Office in full view of reporters to have that goodbye which is one the Pope picks is someone who usually shied away from the press shy away from the publicity but you got a moment in the Sun here that is far more she got a far better exit than say Rex Tillerson who was fired by a tweet or David Shulkin who was fired in a Curt phone call from chief of staff John Kelly and there's certainly there's a lot of anxiety in the West Wing and members of the cabinet that there may be more departures coming our reporting tonight suggests there's not one imminent although we always put an asterisk the president could change his mind at any time but there is a sense around the building that Shulkin you know had the president's attention in recent days for the ethics scandal now that that's over Trump who likes to deal with kind of one thing at a time may turn his attention to someone else whether that's Ben Carson or stinky or Pruett and even John Kelly who's again job standing at the moment seems secure but is without question seen some his influence wane in the West Wing Jackie I'm curious as to what you're hearing it is odd that a departure or two and it's Thursday after all creates more kind of ancillary anxiety back home in Washington especially now that the boss is in that environment the friendly confines of mar-a-lago we're paying friends and paying guests will surround him now for the next couple of days right and we've seen with one personnel change after another that after the fact you learned that he was talking to people the friends that he runs into over dinner plays golf with and he just throws out names and asked them well what about this person what about that person and that's not the kind of people that people back in Washington his own staff would like him to be talking to you know and a lot of these people are telling him what they want to hear anyway and it's just the idea to I mean take to this week's that dr. Shulkin was replaced by dr. Ronnie Jackson who's at the White House heading up a team of about 20 doctors and nurses and health assistance in the care of the president and vice president and and and he's going to a the second largest bureaucracy in our government second only to the Pentagon that is just renowned for its dysfunction it's just it's it's like a recipe for disaster Phillip the departure of Shulkin was corleone asked the more we learn about it I'm going to play for you from our 8 p.m. broadcast an interview Chris Hayes conducted with the now former VA secretary it speaks to the out of nowhere dismissal of him yesterday I spoke to the president yesterday we spoke about the progress that I was making what I needed to do from a policy perspective that's before you were fired that's correct you spoke to him he made no mention of the fact that he was about to terminate you that's correct and then you found out via tweet right before that the chief of staff kelly gave me a call which I appreciate it gave me a heads-up and so but but that was much after the phone call so while not a dead carp inside newspaper inside a bulletproof vest that is the kind of thing that can spread anxiety among employees yeah just five would I mean it certainly isn't the case that this was totally out of the blue I mean there had been press reports for a long time that children was perhaps going to make an exit he seems to have prepared an entire editorial that gotten to the New York Times fairly quickly he seemed to see the writing on the wall but I think what's fascinating here is that none of us are surprised by the way in which you made it that was that was almost what happened to Rex Tillerson right Rex Tolson got a random call in Africa from Kelly saying hey look out for a tweet and next thing you know Rex Tillerson is I mean they made sure to leak how he received where he was young he received a call just to add insult to injury exactly I mean I actually went back and looked at all the people who left the White House and it depends first of all depends on how you define senior staff members but by my count the number of senior officials that have left this administration and we're losing one essentially every nine days with Shulkin starters it seems to be eight or nine days and not only that but I went back and looked at all the ones who actually been officially fired and not just resigned under pressure and I think McMaster was the only one where Trump himself actually did the firing every other case was either Kelly or someone else that that had had fallen on that sort and I just think I think that's a remarkable thing especially for the your fire president hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
