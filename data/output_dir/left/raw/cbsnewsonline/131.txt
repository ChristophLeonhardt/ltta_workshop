1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:01,434
INVESTIGATION. 

2
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:02,401
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE 

3
00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:03,603
INSPECTOR GENERAL GOES IN AND 

4
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:07,006
TAKES A LOOK AND FIND OUT FOR US

5
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,508
IN THE COMMITTEE AND FOR THE 

6
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,009
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT REALLY 

7
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:10,477
HAPPENED. 

8
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:13,713
HE DID HE WENT IN AND SPENT A 

9
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:14,547
LOT OF TIME INTERVIEWING MANY 

10
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,381
PEOPLE. 

11
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:18,618
HE DID CHASTISE YOU. 

12
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:21,588
I UNDERSTAND YOU EXCEPT THAT 

13
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:22,088
ADMONISHMENT. 

14
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:25,225
YOU FOUND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE 

15
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,060
WHATSOEVER OF POLITICAL BIAS IN 

16
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,830
THE DECISION MADE IN THAT 

17
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,831
INVESTIGATION AND A DIRECT 

18
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,734
QUOTE OF WE DO NOT FIND 

19
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,469
DOCUMENTS OR TESTIMONY OF 

20
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:40,940
PROPER CONSIDERATIONS MADE. 

21
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,642
TO LISTEN TO SOME OF MY FRIENDS 

22
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,310
YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE FBI 

23
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,079
WHICH I HAD ALWAYS FELT WAS 

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,681
MADE UP OF CONSERVATIVE LAW-

25
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:52,519
ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE HAD 

26
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,352
MAGICALLY BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO 

27
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:53,886
A LEFT-WING ORGANIZATION. 

28
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:56,089
THAT IS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING. 

29
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,458
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE 

30
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,092
PEOPLE WHO WERE IN CHARGE YOU 

31
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:05,965
HAVE PEOPLE APPOINTED BY THE 

32
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,199
PRESIDENT THAT ARE NOT 

33
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:13,439
DEMOCRATS. 

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,046
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT ROBERT 

35
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,181
MUELLER IS NOT A DEMOCRAT. 

36
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:21,981
THESE ARE NOT POLITICAL 

37
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:22,682
DECISIONS MADE BY POLITICAL 

38
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:23,015
OPERATIVES.  

39
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:24,384
THEY SHOULD BE FOLLOWING THE 

40
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:24,650
EVIDENCE. 

41
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,322
I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT IF 

42
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:35,828
YOU HAD WANTED TO HARM AND 

43
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:39,632
INTERFERE WITH THE ELECTION OF 

44
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:43,736
PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU COULD HAVE 

45
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:44,537
LEAKED INFORMATION THAT THE 

46
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:45,338
INVESTIGATION WAS ONGOING. 

47
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,906
NONE OF THAT CAME OUT. 

48
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:52,745
WE ASKED THE LEADERS OF THE 

49
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,079
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FBI 

50
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,281
ABOUT WHETHER THERE WAS AN 

51
00:01:55,281 --> 00:02:00,987
INVESTIGATION OF MR. TRUMP 

52
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:01,621
PRIOR TO THE ELECTION AND WE 

53
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,689
WERE TOLD THEY COULD NOT 

54
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,057
COMMENT ON IT WHICH WAS IN FACT 

55
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,492
THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. 

56
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:08,061
YOU SHOULD NOT COMMENT ON AN 

57
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,929
ONGOING INVESTIGATION. IF YOU 

58
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,164
FIND SOMETHING YOU HAVE AN 

59
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:11,998
INDICTMENT. 

60
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,200
IF YOU DON'T FIND SOMETHING YOU 

61
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,834
SAY NOTHING. 

62
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:19,872
THAT IS WHERE MR. COMEY  

63
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:20,139
ERRORED. 

64
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,976
HE DAMAGED THE CAMPAIGN OF ONE 

65
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,010
OF THE CANDIDATES. 

66
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,578
THE REST IS HISTORY. 

67
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:31,317
I THINK THIS HEARING IS 

68
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,719
EXTRAORDINARY. 

69
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,921
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE 

70
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:38,091
HAD THIS KIND OF CIRCUS OF 

71
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:42,128
TRYING TO INVESTIGATE THE 

72
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,830
INVESTIGATORS WHEN THAT IS 

73
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,530
ALREADY DONE. 

74
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,136
I URGE THAT WE MAKE SURE THE 

75
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,037
ACTIONS WE TAKE DO NOT CREATE 

76
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:55,007
FURTHER DIVISIONS IN OUR 

77
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:58,278
COUNTRY. 

78
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,846
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED A FEW 

79
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,715
MONTHS AGO THE TOP LEADERSHIP 

80
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,951
IN INVESTIGATORS OF THE FBI AND 

81
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,952
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAVE 

82
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:10,289
POLITICIZED THIS INVESTIGATIVE 

83
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:11,891
PROCESS IN FAVOR OF DEMOCRATS 

84
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,859
AND AGAINST REPUBLICANS 

85
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,062
SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 

86
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,196
UNTHINKABLE A SHORT TIME AGO. 

87
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:20,667
IS THAT TWEET SUPPORTED BY THE 

88
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,537
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT? 

89
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:24,871
>> NO. 

90
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,972
>> NO, IT IS NOT. 

91
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,307
I WOULD HOPE THAT THOSE ON THE 

92
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,508
COMMITTEE WHO BELIEVE IN THE 

93
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,976
RULE OF LAW, WHO UNDERSTAND 

94
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,379
THAT OUR COUNTRY WILL BE 

95
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,413
DAMAGED IF WE ALLOW POLITICAL 

96
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:37,717
DIVISIONS TO ATTACK OUR LAW-

97
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,052
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO 

98
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,654
UNDERCUT INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE 

99
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,590
WILL BE HARMING OUR COUNTRY IN 

100
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,026
A WAY THAT OUR ENEMIES 

101
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,629
INCLUDING RUSSIA HOPE WE WOULD 

102
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,596
DO. 

103
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:52,932
THAT'S WHY THEY INTERFERED IN 

104
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:53,499
OUR ELECTION. 

105
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:57,070
TWO CAUSES HARM, CREATE DIVISION

106
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,938
AMONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND 

107
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,007
AMONG US HERE IN THE HALLS OF 

108
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:01,307
GOVERNMENT. 

109
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,277
I WOULD ASK THAT WE TAKE YES, 

110
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,244
FOR AN ANSWER. 

111
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,547
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL 

112
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,882
INVESTIGATED THIS MATTER. 

113
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,551
HE FOUNDOUT THERE WAS NOT 

114
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,719
POLITICAL INFLUENCE. 

115
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,921
WE WAIT FOR THE RESULTS OF THE 

116
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,288
INVESTIGATION. 

117
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,524
I PRAY THAT WE FIND OUR 

118
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,325
PRESIDENT WAS NOT INVOLVED. 

119
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,929
THAT WOULD BE GREAT NEWS FOR 

120
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,931
OUR COUNTRY. 

121
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,432
IF THAT IS THE FINDING I WILL 

122
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,467
ACCEPT IT NOT INVESTIGATE IT. 

123
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,801
I HOPE THAT WE CAN PUT OUR 

124
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,504
PARTISANSHIP AT THE DOOR. STEP 

125
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:35,541
BACK FROM THE PRECIPICE THAT WE 

126
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,276
ARE FINDING OURSELVES NOW. 

127
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,012
I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS HEARING 

128
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:41,347
WHICH I THINK SERVES NO GOOD 

129
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,448
PURPOSE FOR OUR COUNTRY COULD 

130
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,584
BE BROUGHT TO AN END. 

131
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:48,788
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 

132
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,223
GENTLEMAN FROM TENNESSEE MR. 

133
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:50,623
DUNCAN. 

134
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,159
>> THANK YOU, QUICKLY I WOULD 

135
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,028
LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH 

136
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:56,596
THE OUTSTANDING OPENING 

137
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:00,166
STATEMENTS MADE BY THE CHAIRMAN.

138
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,503
THEY WERE THE FINEST OPENING 

139
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,604
STATEMENTS I'VE HEARD IN MY 30 

140
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:10,309
YEARS OF CONGRESS. 

141
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:15,180
WELL MR. STRZOK WILL STUBBORNLY 

142
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,182
OT ADMIT WHAT EVERYONE ELSE 

143
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,418
KNOWS IS EXTREME BIAS  I FIND 

144
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,486
IT AMAZING THAT HE CAN SIT HERE 

145
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,188
AND SAY THAT HE WAS NOT BIASED 

146
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,557
IN ANY WAY THAT WOULD AFFECT 

147
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,725
HIS INVESTIGATIONS. 

148
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:30,229
IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I 

149
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,999
WANT TO READ THE WORDS FROM THE 

150
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:34,533
INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE 

151
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,169
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHO WROTE 

152
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,070
THAT THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION 

153
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,475
WAS THE WAY IT WAS CONDUCTED WAS

154
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,976
INCONSISTENT WITH TYPICAL 

155
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:48,681
INVESTIGATIVE STRATEGY AND GAVE 

156
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,349
RISE TO ACCUSATIONS OF BIAS AND 

157
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,586
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT. 

158
00:05:53,586 --> 00:06:00,693
I WOULD GUESS MR. STRZOK KNOWS 

159
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,894
CHRIS, WHO SPENT 24 YEARS WITH 

160
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,329
THE FBI  AND RETIRED AS THE 

161
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,097
HEAD OF ALL CRIMINAL 

162
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:09,836

OF POLITICAL BIAS BY THE FBI 

165
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,345
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP BUT FAILS 

166
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:24,317
TO ADD ALL UP TO COME TO THE 

167
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,052
INEVITABLE CONCLUSION THAT 

168
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,853
POLITICAL BIAS WAS THERE. 

169
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,755
THIS IS LIKE SAYING ONE PLUS 

170
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,356
ONE EQUALS ZERO. 

171
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:35,094
DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO THINK 

172
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,431
THEY HAD SOME SORT OF BIAS OR 

173
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,499
ANIMOSITY TOWARDS YOU? 

174
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,335
>> I DISAGREE WITH THE 

175
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,035
CONCLUSIONS. 

176
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,971
I CAN'T SPEAK TO MOTIVATIONS OF 

177
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:47,606
BIAS WHATSOEVER. 

178
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:49,809
I KNOW OF NO BIAS I THE

FINDING ON TRAN34 BY THE

FEARS A HIGH-RANKING GOVERNMENT

ELECTION. 

189
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:16,702
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 

190
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:20,673
YOU KNOW THAT JUDGES WHO HAVE 

191
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:24,710
MINIMAL BIAS ARE REQUIRED TO 

192
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,915
RECRUIT THEMSELVES FROM A CASE. 

193
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,117
DO YOU THINK FBI AGENTS HAVE 

194
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:40,159
SOME SORT OF SPECIAL TREATMENT? 

195
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:48,067
>> I WOULD SAY THAT FBI AGENTS, 

196
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:48,968
JUDGES, ALL ARE EXPECTED AT 

197
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,769
WHATEVER THEIR PERSONAL 

198
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,138
BELIEVES THAT THEY SENT -- SET 

199
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,607
THOSE BELIEVES INSIDE. 

200
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,841
>> YOU DON'T BELIEVE YOU ARE 

201
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,477
ENTITLED TO A LOWER STANDARD. 

202
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:02,014
>> I AM HELD TO THE HIGHEST 

203
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,516
STANDARD AND I ABIDED BY THAT. 

204
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,485
>> YOU TOLD THE CHAIRMAN THAT 

205
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,019
YOU DID NOT THINK YOU SHOULD 

206
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,688
HAVE HER CRUISE YOURSELF IN 

207
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,023
THIS CASE. 

208
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:21,167
-- RECUSE YOURSELF IN THIS CASE.

209
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,468
>> I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE 

210
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,502
IN KEEPING WITH THE HIGH 

211
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:24,370
STANDARDS OF THE F PI. 

212
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,542
>> I THINK THAT -- FBI. I THINK 

213
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,944
THAT THEY HAD POLITICAL RAM 

214
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:36,482
HAITIANS AND -- RAMIFICATIONS 

215
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,583
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR YOU TO HER 

216
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,120
CRUISE YOURSELF AND MOVE ON TO 

217
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,788
OTHER WORK. 

218
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,023
THERE ARE MANY OTHER CASES HE 

219
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,992
COULD HAVE WORKED ON. 

220
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,895
>> I DISAGREE WITH YOU. 

221
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:50,896
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE 

222
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:53,165
BEEN NECESSARY FOR ME TO DO 

223
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:53,365
THAT. 

224
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:56,001
I THINK EVERY DAY WITH THE 

225
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:59,505
INVESTIGATION AND WHEN I WALKED 

226
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,841
IN THE DOOR THE ENTIRETY OF MY 

227
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,276
ACTIONS WAS DEDICATED TO 

228
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:05,478
PURSUING THE FACTS WHEREVER 

229
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,979
THEY LIVE. 

230
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,815
MANY TIMES -- 

231
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:16,288
>> AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND 

232
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:17,223
GUILTY THEY APOLOGIZE AND SAY 

233
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,025
THEY ARE SORRY AND TRY TO GET 

234
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:19,325
PROBATION. 

235
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,594
MANY TIMES PEOPLE THINK THOSE 

236
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,796
APOLOGIES ARE SET MORE IN HOPES 

237
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,465
OF GETTING PROBATION AND REGRET 

238
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,101
THAT THEY HAD BEEN CAUGHT 

239
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:35,041
RATHER THAN A SINCERE APOLOGY. 

240
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,075
DO YOU FEEL YOU SHOULD 

241
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,310
APOLOGIZE IN ANY WAY TO THE 

242
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,978
AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR THE THINGS 

243
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:42,515
YOU EXPRESSED? DO YOU HAVE A 

244
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:50,623
REQUEST -- REGRET? 

245
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,293
>> I DON'T AGREE WITH THE 

246
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,194
CHARACTERIZATION OF MY VIEWS AS 

247
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,062
BIAS. 

248
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:00,399
I CLEARLY ARTICULATE AND I HOPE 

249
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,801
WHEN YOU HEARD ME IN MY OPENING 

250
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,702
STATEMENT WHEN I TALKED ABOUT 

251
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,271
MY REGRET TO THE PEOPLE THAT I 

252
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,874
LOVE IN MY FAMILY WHEN I TALKED 

253
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,109
TO THE WAY THAT THESE TEXT HAVE 

254
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,544
BEEN USED AGAINST IT THE EYE 

255
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,712
WHEN I RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS 

256
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:21,821
ABOUT USING A PHRASE, YES, 

257
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,322
THOSE WERE NOT INTENDED AS 

258
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,356
DIRECT ANIMUS TOWARDS ANY SET 

259
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:24,656
OF PEOPLE. 

260
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,992
I HOPE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND I 

261
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:30,229
SINCERELY REGRET THAT. 

262
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:37,536
>> TIME HAS REQUIRED -- EXPIRED.

263
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:42,808
>> THANK YOU, FOR MONTHS 

264
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,943

BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN TWO 

374
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,588
WITNESSES.  

375
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:27,626
WE CAN SCRUB THAT INTERVIEW FOR 

376
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,427
PERSONAL RELEVANT INFORMATION 

377
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,061
THAT MIGHT BE EMBARRASSING 

378
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,863
BEFORE WE DO THAT WITH THAT 

379
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:31,730
I'LL YIELD BACK. 

380
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:41,140
>> THE GENTLEMAN RECOMMENDATION 

381
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,277
IS TAKEN. WE WILL DEFINITELY 

382
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,012
TAKE THAT UNDER ADVISEMENT. 

383
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:53,385
>> I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD 

384
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,320
GIVE THE FBI THE OPPORTUNITY 

385
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,788
FOR REDUCTION OF ANYTHING THAT 

386
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,790
WOULD IMPACT THE NATION'S 

387
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,657
NATIONAL SECURITY. 

388
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,190
I THINK THAT IS EXTREMELY 

389
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,325
IMPORTANT AND I HOPE THE 

390
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:02,494
GENTLEMAN WILL ACCEPT. 

391
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:10,269
>> I WANT TO THANK, HIM FOR 

392
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,272
TRYING TO WORK THESE THINGS OUT 

393
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,140
IN FULL TRANSPARENCY. 

394
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,177
I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT. 

395
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:18,977
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON THIS 

396
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,211
COMMITTEE WILL APPRECIATE IT. 

397
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:24,249
>> DOES THE GENTLEMAN FROM 

398
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:31,690
NORTH CAROLINA SUGGEST SOLELY 

399
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,624
ON THE TESTIMONY TO AGENT 

400
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:32,857
STRZOK? 

401
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:34,026
WOULD WE APPLY THAT SAME 

402
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,060
PROCESS  AND THE SAME STANDARD 

403
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,261
TO THE PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED 

404
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,331
TESTIMONY OF ANDREW McCABE WHO 

405
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,732
WAS EXAMINED IN A SIMILAR 

406
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:41,066
ENVIRONMENT? 

407
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,837
>> I THINK IN THE SPIRIT OF 

408
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,805
TRANSPARENCY WE NEED TO LOOK AT 

409
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:47,639
ALL INTERVIEWS TO LET THE 

410
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,576
AMERICAN PEOPLE JUDGE FOR 

411
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,077
THEMSELVES. 

412
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,312
I THINK THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH 

413
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:53,912
MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 

414
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:54,713

417
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:05,390
>> I YIELD MY TIME FOR MY

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,558

WE HAVE BEEN WAITING ON NOW 

427
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,853
WHILE ANDY IS ACTING. 

428
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,456

00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,858
SINCE BEEN FIRED AND REFERRED 

430
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:43,795

DIRECTOR OF THE FBI? 

435
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,068
>> TO GET INTO THAT WOULD 

436
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,369
RELATE TO ON GOING 

437
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:52,304

ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS. 

441
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,383
>> LET ME SEE IF I COULD GIVE 

442
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,717

AND THEN THERE IS A BLACK MARK 

448
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,497
WERE SOMEONE'S NAME HAS BEEN 

449
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,365

00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:27,940
WHOSE NAME IS BLOCKED OUT? 

453
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,874
>> I DON'T KNOW. 

454
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,609
I NEED TO SEE THE ORIGINAL 

455
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:30,809

456
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:37,916

457
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,251
HERE IS WHAT ELSE I DON'T KNOW. 

458
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,552

460
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:41,753
DEMOCRAT.

I DON'T KNOW IF THERE BLOCK, 

462
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:43,522

463
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,523
I DON'T KNOW THEIR RELIGIOUS 

464
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,024
BELIEFS OR SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS. 

465
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:46,892
I DON'T CARE. 

466
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:50,963
I DO KNOW DECISIONS ABOUT WHEN 

467
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,864
AND WHETHER TO OPEN 

468
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,232
INVESTIGATIONS AND WHEN AND 

469
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,600
WHETHER TO CHARGE PEOPLE WITH 

470
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,400
CRIMES AREN'T SUPPOSED TO 

471
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,703
DEPEND ON WHO'S SITTING IN THE 

472
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,537
DIRECTOR'S CHAIR OR ON 

473
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,005

00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,641
POLITICAL AGENDAS OF FBI AGENTS 

475
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,143
AND LAWYERS. 

476
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:06,245
IF A TRUMP HATING FBI AGENTS 

477
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,513
AND A TRUMP HATING LAWYER HAVE 

478
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:11,416
TALKED ABOUT IMPEACHING TRUMP 

479
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,918
AND STOPPING TRUMP WITHIN HOURS 

480
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:20,692
OF HIM FIRING THEIR BOSS IF 

481
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,426
THEY START TALKING ABOUT 

482
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,327
OPENING AN INVESTIGATION NOW 

483
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,462
THE ANDY, IS ACTING IN THAT 

484
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,663
SOME PERSON NEEDS TO BE LOCKED 

485
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,064
IN IN A FORMAL CHARGEABLE WAY 

486
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,766
SOON, I KNOW, AS A FORMAL U.S. 

487
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:34,172
ATTORNEY I KNOW THAT WHOEVER IS 

488
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:35,407

492
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,216
THEIR CIVIL LIBERTIES VIOLATED. 

493
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,750
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED 

494
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:51,890
OF DUE PROCESS. 

495
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,891
MY SECOND QUESTION TO YOU YOU 

496
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,827
COULD NOT ANSWER. 

497
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,062
LET'S GO FOR A THIRD QUESTION. 

498
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,830
ON PAGE 400 OF THE IG REPORT 

499
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,097
SOMEONE TELLS THE INSPECTOR 

500
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:04,703
GENERAL THERE IS A BRIGHT LINE, 

501
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,871
A BRIGHT INVIOLABLE LINE 

502
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,339
BETWEEN WHAT YOU THINK 

503
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,540
PERSONALLY AND BELIEVE IN THE 

504
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,676
CONDUCT OF YOUR OFFICIAL 

505
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:12,844
BUSINESS. 

506
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,779
WHO SAID THAT? 

507
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,884
>> I BELIEVE I DID, SIR. 

508
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,185
>> YOU DID SAY THAT. 

509
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,119
I HEARD YOU SAY SIMILAR THINGS 

510
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,753
LAST WEEK, AND TODAY. 

511
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:27,926
YOU SAID IT CLEARLY YOU SAID 

512
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:28,660
UNEQUIVOCALLY IN YOUR OPENING 

513
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,695
REMARKS THAT YOU NEVER CROSSED 

514
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:30,696
THAT INDELIBLE LINE IN 26 

515
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:30,929
YEARS. 

516
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,130
EARLIER TODAY IN RESPONSE TO A 

517
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,633
QUESTION YOU SAID I TOOK MY 

518
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,101
PERSONAL BELIEF OUT OF EVERY 

519
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:40,405
OFFICIAL ACTION. 

520
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,406
YOU ARE ASKING US TO BELIEVE 

521
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,841
THAT WHEN YOU SAY THINGS LIKE F 

522
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,877
TRAP AND STOP TRUMP, AND 

523
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:46,912
IMPEACH TRUMP THAT THOSE ARE 

524
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,512
JUST PERSONAL BELIEFS. 

525
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,148
WHEN YOU SAY THOSE THINGS YOU 

526
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,616
NEVER CROSSED THAT WINE. 

527
00:20:51,616 --> 00:21:00,125
THAT RIGHT INVIOLABLE LINE AND 

528
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,360
ALLOWED TO IMPACT YOUR OFFICIAL 

529
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:01,627
CONDUCT. 

530
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:02,661
THAT IS WHAT THIS COMES DOWN 

531
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:02,961
TO. 

532
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:03,995
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING US TO 

533
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:04,262
BELIEVE? 

534
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,731
>> I AM ASKING YOU TO BELIEVE 

535
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,431
AND I'M OFFERING EVIDENCE. 

536
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,102
THE IG REPORT SAYS THERE IS 

537
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:14,506
BEEN NO ACTIVE BIAS FOUND 

538
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:14,906
ANYWHERE. 

539
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,241
>> UNDER OATH YOU HAVE BEEN AS 

540
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,576
CLEAR AS A BELL ON THAT. 

541
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,977
YOU HAVE READ IT OVER AND OVER 

542
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:19,210
AGAIN. 

543
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,011
BECAUSE OF THAT I'M EMBARRASSED 

544
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:25,283
TO ASK THIS QUESTION. 

545
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:25,917
OF THE APPROXIMATELY 50,000 

546
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,319
TEXT MESSAGES THAT I HAVE SEEN 

547
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,723
WITH YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS LIKE 

548
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:32,424
STOP TRUMP, IMPEACH TRUMP, 

549
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,658
CONFIRM ON THE RECORD THAT NONE 

550
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:34,859
OF THAT OCCURRED ON AN OFFICIAL 

551
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:36,194
AT THE EYE DEVICE OR OFFICIAL 

552
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,863
OF THE EYE TIME. 

553
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:42,234
-- FBI DEVICE OR FBI TIME. 

554
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:46,705
>> YOU MEANT TO SAY THAT WHEN

00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,841
YOU NEVER CROSSED THAT LINE YOU 

556
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:54,980
MEANT TO SAY EXCEPT FOR 50,000

568
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,104
DRAWN THAT LINE. 

569
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,839
ARE YOU STARTING TO UNDERSTAND 

570
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,207
WHY SOME FOLKS OUT THERE DON'T 

571
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,810
BELIEVE A WORD USED DAY AND WHY 

572
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,610
IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING THAT 

573
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,245
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE ARE AT THE 

574
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,881

RECENT TIMES THAT INVOLVE 

577
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,118
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THAT YOU 

578
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,386
WERE IN CHARGE OF AN 

579
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,989
INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATING 

580
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:42,594
GATHERING EVIDENCE AGAINST

DONALD TRUMP A SUBJECT THAT YOU 

582
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:45,763
HATE AND THAT YOU WANT TO STOP 

583
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:46,064
 

584
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,399
DO YOU SEE WHY THAT MIGHT CALL 

585
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,568
INTO QUESTION EVERY THING YOU 

586
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:54,673
HAVE TOUCHED ON ALL OF THOSE 

587
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,040
INVESTIGATION. 

588
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,874
I AM DONE WITH THIS WITNESS. 

589
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,142
I YIELD BACK. 

590
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:08,086

591
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:08,953
>> THERE ARE SEVERAL STATEMENT 

592
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:09,921
I ONLY HEARD ONE QUESTION. 

593
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:10,956
>> I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE 

594
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,357
MIGHT THINK THAT BASED ON THE 

595
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:16,294
REPRESENTATIONS IN THE MEDIA. 

596
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:19,030
I AM GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY 

597
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,532
PUBLICLY. I'M GLAD TO HEAR 

598
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,034
PEOPLE ARE CALLING FOR THE 

599
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:28,573
RECENT -- RELEASE OF MY PRIVATE 

600
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:28,906
INTERVIEW. 

601
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:29,774
PEOPLE CAN JUDGE FOR 

602
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:30,074
THEMSELVES. 

603
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:31,676
WHO I AM AND WHAT I SAID ON THE 

604
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,410
FAX. 

605
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,511
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEING 

606
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:34,445
MISREPRESENTATIVE. 

607
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:37,315
ABSOLUTELY I CAN UNDERSTAND 

608
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,550
THAT AND I'M GLAD THAT THE 

609
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,519
FACTS ARE COMING OUT. 

610
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:45,590
I NEVER, AND I AM UNAWARE OF 

611
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,691
ANY CASE BEING OPEN THAT 

612
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:47,859
REPRESENTED SOME VIOLATION OF 

613
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:54,599
SEVERAL LIBERTIES -- CIVIL 

614
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,233
LIBERTIES AND DUE PROCESS 

615
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:55,534
RIGHTS. 

616
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,735
I'VE NEVER DONE ANY ACTIVITY OR 

617
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,869
OPENED ANY CASE WITH REGARD TO 

618
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:58,270
THAT. 

619
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,271
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONTEXT 

620
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,472
DURING THE TIME THAT THE 

621
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,040
DIRECTOR HAD BEEN FIRED, WHERE 

622
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,875
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THAT 

623
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,776
HAD OCCURRED BECAUSE OF A 

624
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:08,480
MEMORANDUM WRITTEN BY THE 

625
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,415
ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE CLINTON 

626
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:11,249
INVESTIGATION AND THE DAYS 

627
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,350
AFTERWARDS PIVOTING RUSSIAN 

628
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,155
DIPLOMATS HAD A HUGE BURDEN 

629
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:22,861
TAKEN OFF THE SHOULDER. 

630
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:28,166
THE PACE AND SEVERITY AND THE 

631
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,469
FACTS THAT WERE UNFOLDING. 

632
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,304
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 

633
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:39,777
>> IN THAT REGARD BEFORE THINGS 

634
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:40,879
CHANGE IT WAS IMPORTANT TO US. 

635
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:41,913
>> TO YOUR RESPONSE HOWEVER, 

636
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:42,747
AND THE INTEREST OF FULL 

637
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:46,117
TRANSPARENCY AND TO MR. 

638
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:46,985
RADCLIFFE'S POINT WERE YOU 

639
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,588
AUTHORIZED THE RELEASE OF ALL 

640
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,623
OF THE OTHER TEXT MESSAGES THAT 

641
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,925
HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED TO THE 

642
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:58,563
CONGRESS TO THIS POINT? 

643
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,431
>> I WOULD AUTHORIZE THE 

644
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,264
RELEASE OF ANY WORK-RELATED 

645
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:12,376
TEXT MESSAGES OUT MESSAGES. 

646
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:14,913
>> EVEN THOUGH YOUR TESTIMONY 

647
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:18,883
IS THAT YOU WOULD NEVER LET 

648
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,619
YOUR WORK INTERFERE WITH YOUR 

649
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,019
PERSONAL OPINION. 

650
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:21,753
>> THAT IS EXACTLY MY 

651
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,053
TESTIMONY. 

652
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,055
>> HOW ARE WE GOING TO KNOW 

653
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,757
THAT UNLESS WE SEE THOSE TEXT 

654
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:26,024
MESSAGES? 

655
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,660
>> SO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, 

656
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,462
VERY CAREFULLY, AN INDEPENDENT 

657
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,863
BODY WENT EXHAUSTIVELY THROUGH 

658
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:35,033
THE ENTIRE OF THAT BODY AND 

659
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:42,207
FOUND THERE WERE NO ACTS OF -- 

660
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,541
>> ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WILL YOU 

661
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,344
AUTHORIZE RELEASE OF THEM TO 

662
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:46,844
THE YOU TAITS CONGRESS? 

663
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:47,646
>> NO, SIR. 

664
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,414
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, POINT OF 

665
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,682
INQUIRY, I'M TRYING TO 

666
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,916
UNDERSTAND HIS ANSWER. 

667
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:55,086
MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE 

668
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,855
INSPECTOR GENERAL DID NOT SEE 

669
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,758
WHAT HE IS CLAIMING TO BE HIS 

670
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,159
PERSONAL TEXTS THAT THEY WERE 

671
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,161
REQUESTED AND HE DELIVERED WHAT 

672
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,430
HE SAID WAS BUSINESS RELATED, 

673
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,233
SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, 

674
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,467
NO ONE HAS SEEN ANYTHING THAT 

675
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,369
HE DETERMINED, MR. STRZOK 

676
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,738
DETERMINED WOULD NOT BE 

677
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,706
DELIVERED BECAUSE IN HIS 

678
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,007
OPINION THEY WERE NOT BUSINESS 

679
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:16,941
RELATED, I HAVE A NUMBER OF 

680
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:19,444
TEXTS IN FRONT OF ME THAT I 

681
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,745
WOULD SAY WERE VERY PERSONAL 

682
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,746
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT 

683
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,114
UNDOUBTEDLY HE WOULD HAVE 

684
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:23,647
OBJECTED TO TURNING OVER. 

685
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:25,483
>> THE GENTLEMAN MAKES A VERY 

686
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:25,783
GOOD POINT. 

687
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:26,651
HE MAY WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS 

688
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,486
ABOUT THAT WHEN HE IS SHORTLY 

689
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:29,854
TO BE RECOGNIZED. 

690
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,556
BUT FIRST WE'RE GOING TO 

691
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:32,290
RECOGNIZE THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM 

692
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,558
TEXAS, MS. JACKSON LEE FOR FIVE 

693
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:33,858
MINUTES. 

694
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,927
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU VERY 

695
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:36,361
MUCH. 

696
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:36,995
I'M SORRY MY COLLEAGUE WALKED 

697
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,264
OUT BEFORE MR. STRZOK COULD 

698
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:39,731
GIVE HIS ANSWERS. 

699
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,865
I HATE NO ONE. 

700
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,934
I DO NOT HATE THE 

701
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,135
ADMINISTRATION, THE PRESIDENT, 

702
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,169
MY COLLEAGUES. 

703
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:46,671
IN FACT, I LOVE THIS NATION. 

704
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:47,939
I HONOR THIS NATION. 

705
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,841
AND SO I BELIEVE IT IS 

706
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,844
IMPORTANT THAT WE STAND ON THE 

707
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,612
FORCE OF TRUTH IN THE 

708
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:54,979
CONSTITUTION. 

709
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,915
IN THE OVERSIGHT OF THESE TWO 

710
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,017
COMMITTEES, IT IS UNFORTUNATE 

711
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,620
THAT NONE OF THESE COMMITTEES 

712
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,187
JUDICIARY OVERSIGHT HAVE 

713
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,255
DECIDED TO PURSUE MORE PRECIOUS 

714
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,858
OR MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAN 

715
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:07,859
ASKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S 

716
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:11,029
E-MAILS WHICH HAVE BEEN WELL 

717
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,263
DOCUMENTED THAT THERE WAS NO 

718
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,099
CRIMINAL IMPACT AND IN ESSENCE 

719
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,032
SHE WAS VINDICATED BY THE 

720
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:17,268
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT AND 

721
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:17,735
BY OTHER REPORTS. 

722
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:19,703
UNFORTUNATELY THIS HAS BECOME A 

723
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:20,137
FISHING EXPEDITION. 

724
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:21,339
WHAT WE HAVE NOT DONE -- WHAT 

725
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,907
WE HAVE NOT DONE IS INVESTIGATE 

726
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:26,511
THE CHILDREN BEING STOLEN AWAY 

727
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:29,547
FROM THEIR FAMILIES, NOR HAVE 

728
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,448
WE LOOKED AT OUR PRESIDENT 

729
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:33,218
MEETING WITH MR. PUTIN GETTING 

730
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,986
HIS ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW 

731
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,688
WHILE OFFENDING OUR NATO 

732
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:37,956
ALLIES. 

733
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:38,889
FOREIGN POLICY SCHOLARS ARE 

734
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:40,658
AGHAST THAT THIS PRESIDENT -- 

735
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,494
>> EVERYONE, WELCOME BACK TO 

736
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,461
CBSN, I'M REENA NINAN. 

737
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,896
YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO F.B.I. 

738

743
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,838
STRZOK WAS PART OF THE MUELLER

PROBE BUT WAS DISMISSED AFTER 

745
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:55,807

CLOSEST ALLY, ENGLAND AND ITS 

753
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:10,355
FIRST VISIT TO THE COUNTRY 

754
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:10,855
SINCE TAKING OFFICE. 

755
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,657
YOU SEE HIM THERE ARRIVING WITH 

756
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:13,158
THE FIRST LADY. 

757
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:13,591
THIS WAS EARLIER. 

758
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,393
TOMORROW THE PRESIDENT WILL 

759
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:16,361
ALSO MEET WITH BRITISH PRIME

THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND. 

762
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,698
BUT WIDESPREAD PROTESTS ARE 

763
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:20,965
EXPECTED. 

764
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,467
AND THIS COMES AFTER A SERIES 

765
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,370
OF TENSE MEETINGS AT THE ANNUAL 

766
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:25,703
NATO SUMMIT. 

767
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,938
MR. TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY 

768
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,940
SLAMMED ALLIES FOR NOT DOING 

769
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,041
THEIR FAIR SHARE. 

770
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,443
WELL, THIS MORNING HE PRESSURED 

771
00:28:32,443 --> 00:28:33,677
THEM TO INCREASE DEFENSE 

772
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:35,980
SPENDING WHILE REAFFIRMING THE 

773
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,180
U.S.' 

774
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,048
COMMITMENT TO THE ALLIANCE. 

775
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,550
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SUGGESTED 

776
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,351
THAT THEY AGREED TO HIS FUNDING 

777
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:40,617
DEMANDS. 

778
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:41,453
BUT NOW SOME LEADERS ARE 

779
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,954
SAYING, NO, THAT WAS ACTUALLY 

780
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:43,287
NOT THE CASE. 

781
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:46,691
HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD 

782
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:46,924
TO SAY. 

783
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:48,760
>> AND THE UNITED STATES' 

784
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,995
COMMITMENT TO NATO IS VERY 

785
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,264
STRONG, REMAINS VERY STRONG, 

786
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:54,265
BUT PRIMARILY BECAUSE EVERYONE, 

787
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:55,700
THE SPIRIT THEY HAVE, THE 

788
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,101
AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY'RE WILLING 

789
00:28:57,101 --> 00:29:00,037
TO SPEND, THE ADDITIONAL MONEY 

790
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:01,239
THAT THEY WILL BE PUTTING UP 

791
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,341
HAS BEEN REALLY, REALLY AMAZING 

792
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:07,345
TO SEE IT, TO SEE THE LEVEL OF 

793
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,780
SPIRIT IN THAT ROOM IS 

794
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,348
INCREDIBLE. 

795
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,051
>> JOINING ME NOW RETIRED 

796
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:13,918
GENERAL PHILIP BREEDLOVE. 

797
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:14,919
HE'S A FORMER SUPREME ALLIED 

798
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,287
COMMANDER OF EUROPE WHICH IS 

799
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,791
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF NATO 

800
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:20,258
MILITARY OPERATIONS. 

801
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,927
HE'S ALSO A CYFHER BRIEF 

802
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:23,160
EXPERT. 

803
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,262
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING 

804
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:24,495
YOU US. 

805
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:26,497
IT WAS JOB TO MAKE SURE THE MEN 

806
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:27,465
AND WOMEN OF NATO WERE PROPERLY 

807
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:31,102
FUNDED, MADE SURE THEY HAD THE 

808
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,570
SUPPORT THEY NEEDED. 

809
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,906
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON PRESSURE 

810
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,307
POINTS THAT THEY DON'T MEET 

811
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:36,774
FUNDING COMMITMENTS? 

812
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,009
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT 

813
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,744
THAT WE DO BRING OUR ALLIES TO 

814
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,846
A POINT WHERE THEY'RE INVESTING 

815
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,081
MORE IN THEIR MILITARIES, AND 

816
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,449
I'VE BEEN NOTED TO SAY BEFORE 

817
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,418
THAT SOMETIMES I DON'T TOTALLY 

818
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,386
AGREE WITH THE TACTICS, 

819
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:49,153
TECHNIQUES OR PROCEDURES THAT 

820
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:53,992
OUR PRESIDENT MAY USE, BUT THE 

821
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,028
BOTTOM LINE IS IN I WANT 

822
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,563
LECTUAL HONESTY, WE HAVE TO -- 

823
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,131
INTELLECTUAL HONESTY, WE HAVE 

824
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,466
TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHERE OUR THREE 

825
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,299
PREDECESSORS HAVE FAILED, THIS 

826
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:04,068
PRESIDENT HAS MOVED THE NEEDLE 

827
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,069
ON INVESTMENT BY OUR NATO 

828
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:05,369
ALLIES. 

829
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:07,639
THERE'S STILL A LOT TO BE DONE 

830
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,140
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS 

831
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,843
MORNING'S EMERGENCY MEETING WAS 

832
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,245
ALL ABOUT, TO GET SORT OF A 

833
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,947
RECOMMITMENT TO SPEEDING UP 

834
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,715
THAT INVESTMENT TO THE 2% OF 

835
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:17,948
G.D.P. 

836
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:18,182
LEVEL. 

837
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:20,351
>> SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE 

838
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,754
GIVING THE PRESIDENT A WIN ON 

839
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,389
THE SCOREBOARD FOR GETTING THAT 

840
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,089
MILITARY SPENDING INCREASED A 

841
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:25,289
BIT. 

842
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:26,157
BUT IN PARTICULAR, YOU'VE ALSO 

843
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,092
SAID THAT ONE OF THE MOST 

844
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,627
IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT NATO IS 

845
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:30,528
ACTUALLY THE SOLIDARITY AMONG 

846
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,295
THE DIFFERENT NATIONS. 

847
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:34,198
DO YOU THINK THAT SENSE OF 

848
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:35,133
SOLIDARITY HAS BEEN BLUDGEONED 

849
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:35,766
BY THE PRESIDENT? 

850
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:39,337
>> SO I THINK THIS IS A REALLY 

851
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,839
KEY QUESTION BECAUSE WHEN ASKED 

852
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,842
IN THE CYPHER BRIEF AND OTHERS 

853
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:46,344
WHAT I THINK WOULD BE A 

854
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,546
SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT, ITEM ONE IS 

855
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:52,016
ALWAYS THE SOLIDARITY OF THE 

856
00:30:52,016 --> 00:00:00,000
ALLIANCE,
