1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:01,618
THAT AS WELL.

2
00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:05,989
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, THANK YOU.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,590
LET'S BRING IN GEORGIA

4
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:10,760
CONGRESSMAN DOUG COLLINS.

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:11,561
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY

6
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:12,295
COMMITTEE RIGHT ON TIME WITH

7
00:00:12,296 --> 00:00:14,764
THIS TOPIC, GREAT TO SEE YOU

8
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:15,065
TODAY.

9
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:16,166
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

10
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:19,970
ABOUT ROSENSTEIN JUST IN TERMS

11
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:22,005
OF A SARCASM MOMENT, IT WAS A

12
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:22,405
JOKE.

13
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,974
I WOULD THAT MATTER IF YOU'RE

14
00:00:23,975 --> 00:00:25,675
TALKING ABOUT WEARING A WIRE TO

15
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:28,545
RECORD THE PRESIDENT AND

16
00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:29,813
INVOKING THE 25TH AMENDMENT TO

17
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:30,981
GET OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE?

18
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:33,950
THE SARCASM, DOES JOKING MATTER?

19
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:39,089
>> FOR HIM, IT SHOULD NOT.

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,625
ESPECIALLY IN ENVIRONMENT LIKE

21
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:42,626
WE HAD WHICH IS INSIDE THE DOJ

22
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:46,429
TO BE PARTISAN AND VERY MUCH

23
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,198
AGAINST HIM THAT WE FEEL IS A

24
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:48,898
BILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

25
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,367
FOR HIM TO EVEN JOKE IF HE DID

26
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:51,668
SO WAS A WRONG JOKE AND I THINK

27
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:54,004
THIS IS WHY THIS NEEDS TO BE

28
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:55,305
CONSIDERED AND MOVED FORWARD

29
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:56,673
BECAUSE HE SHOULD BE DOING

30
00:00:56,674 --> 00:00:57,674
THINGS LIKE THAT.

31
00:00:57,675 --> 00:00:58,575
EDGES UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE IN

32
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:02,345
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NO JOKE OR

33
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:02,646
JOKE.

34
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:03,747
>> Harris: JUST IN TERMS OF

35
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:05,248
GETTING TO THE TRUTH OF THE

36
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:05,649
FACTS HERE.

37
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,952
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD BE

38
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:09,753
SIMPLE QUESTIONS AS HE NEEDS

39
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:14,691
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE

40
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:15,392
CONTEXT OF THE CONVERSATION.

41
00:01:15,393 --> 00:01:17,127
LIKE WHY WOULD THAT IS SARCASM

42
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:18,328
OR A JOKE EVEN BE FUNNY?

43
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,231
WHAT WAS THE CONTEXT IS

44
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:22,666
IMPORTANT.

45
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,635
>> THE CONTEXT IS ALSO IMPORTANT

46
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:28,538
BUT WE SAID A FEW MINUTES AGO,

47
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:31,107
AND MAY BE IMPORTANT AND IT WAS

48
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:32,942
A BIG JOKE BUT WHEN YOU HAVE

49
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:33,677
SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS SAYING

50
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:35,545
I'M GOING TO WEAR WIRE WITH THE

51
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:37,213
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

52
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:38,782
AND LOOK TO SAY I WILL HELP

53
00:01:38,783 --> 00:01:40,583
INVOKE THE 25TH AMENDMENT,

54
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:41,217
YOU'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT

55
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:43,153
TEARING DOWN THE VERY FABRIC IN

56
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:43,920
THE VERY LEADER OF OUR FREE

57
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,554
WORLD.

58
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:45,422
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING EVEN A

59
00:01:45,423 --> 00:01:47,957
CONTEXT THAT SHOULD BE ALLOWED.

60
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,893
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE

61
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:50,794
OFF LIMITS.

62
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:54,097
HE MAY WANT TO SAY I WAS JOKING

63
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:55,298
BUT THAT IS REALLY A DISTINCT

64
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:56,199
SIGN OF POOR JUDGMENT WHEN YOU

65
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,501
TAKE THAT ALONG WITH EVERYTHING

66
00:01:58,502 --> 00:02:00,437
ELSE THAT WE'VE SEEN GOING ON,

67
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:04,374
THIS MIX IS EVEN MORE

68
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,176
IDENTIFIABLE AND THAT'S WHY I'M

69
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:07,410
GLAD THE CHAIRMAN IS WORKING ON

70
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:08,611
THIS, THIS IS THE FIRST STEP,

71
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:09,446
NOT THE LAST STEP AND WILL

72
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:10,180
CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AS

73
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:12,482
WE GO FORWARD.

74
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:14,217
>> Harris: SO WE KNOW THAT HE

75
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,186
WAS TALKING TO THEN DEPUTY

76
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:17,287
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI ANDREW

77
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:17,921
McCABE HE DOES MENTION HIS

78
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:20,190
NAME AND WHEN I SAY CONTEXT, I'M

79
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:20,924
CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW MUCH MORE

80
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:24,761
INFORMATION WAS THIS?

81
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:26,696
I WOULD IMAGINE IT WILL ASK

82
00:02:26,697 --> 00:02:27,197
THOSE QUESTIONS.

83
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:30,100
THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO

84
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:31,768
UNDERSTAND, ROSENSTEIN IS A

85
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,002
STAFF MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT,

86
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:35,638
SO HE CAN FIRE HIM, HE CAN

87
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,072
REPLACE HIM.

88
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,440
IF THE CEO THOUGHT THEY WERE

89
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,208
GOING TO BE A CORPORATE CODE TO

90
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,878
GET HIM OUT OF THE POSITION, I

91
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,480
WOULD IMAGINE THAT PERSON WOULD

92
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:44,514
FIRE ANYONE WHO WOULD JOKE LIKE

93
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:47,617
THIS FOR SAY THIS AT ALL.

94
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:49,452
>> WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT

95
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:50,053
ACTUALLY SIT DOWN WITH

96
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:51,588
ROSENSTEIN AND ACTUALLY TALK

97
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,622
ABOUT THIS, THEY'RE WILLING TO

98
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,023
PLAY TOGETHER AND THIS IS

99
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:54,858
SOMEONE THAT YOU RIGHTFULLY SAID

100
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:56,326
CAN FIRE AT ANY MOMENT THAT HE

101
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:57,026
WANTS TO.

102
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:58,661
HE WORKS FOR THE PRESIDENT.

103
00:02:58,662 --> 00:02:59,796
WE ALSO HAVE TO RESPECT THE

104
00:02:59,797 --> 00:03:00,830
PRESIDENT HERE.

105
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:01,965
THE PRESIDENT HAS AN OUTSTANDING

106
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,134
JOB LEADING AND HE IS CONCERNED

107
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:04,868
ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND

108
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:06,402
THE ECONOMY.

109
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:07,904
HE HAS STATED ALL ALONG THAT

110
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:09,672
THIS RUSSIA ISSUE ANY

111
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:11,441
INVESTIGATION WAS NOTHING TO

112
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:11,741
THEM.

113
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:13,810
HE WILL CONTINUE TO STATE THAT.

114
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:15,712
WE IN CONGRESS NEED TO DO OUR

115
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:16,379
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY AND

116
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,113
MAKE SURE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE

117
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,583
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN CONTEXT,

118
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:22,185
BRINGING THESE PEOPLE BEFORE THE

119
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,319
COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE DOJ WAS

120
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,788
VIRTUALLY AT THE TOP OF THEM A

121
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:27,223
AND VERY CORRUPT.

122
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:28,558
WE ALSO NEED TO RESPECT THE

123
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,026
PRESIDENT HAS MADE A DECISION TO

124
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:31,461
KEEP HIM AT THIS POINT AND I

125
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,896
THINK THAT'S A BALANCE ON WHAT

126
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:34,931
WE'RE DOING DOING FROM OUR

127
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:35,698
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY AND

128
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:36,466
ALSO SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT AS

129
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,101
HE HAD KEPT THEM BY NOW.

130
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,335
>> Harris: YOU SAID A MOUTHFUL

131
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:41,571
THERE AND YOU MENTIONED THE

132
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,206
WORDS POLITICAL AND CORRUPT AT

133
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:43,740
THE TOP OF THE DOJ.

134
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:46,176
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT AND

135
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:47,310
WHAT YOU INTEND TO ASK ROD

136
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:50,780
ROSENSTEIN ABOUT IT?

137
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:52,682
>> WE HAVE CONTINUED AND BEGUN

138
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:55,618
THIS PROCESS ALREADY.

139
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:57,187
I MADE IT CLEAR PETER STRZOK

140
00:03:57,188 --> 00:03:57,921
ESPECIALLY SHOULD'VE NEVER NEVER

141
00:03:57,922 --> 00:03:59,622
BEEN A PART OF THE INVESTIGATION

142
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:01,391
WHILE HE WAS OUT OF CLEARANCE

143
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:02,091
ARE OUT OF SCOPE ON HIS

144
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:02,826
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS.

145
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:04,227
HE COULD'VE CLEARED THAT UP

146
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:05,195
EASILY AND HE DIDN'T.

147
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:07,463
HE WENT AHEAD AND WAS PART OF IT

148
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:09,599
IN THE INTERNAL DYNAMICS OF THE

149
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,000
DOJ AT THE TIME ALLOWED THIS TO

150
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:11,801
HAPPEN.

151
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:13,102
WE HAVE SEEN CONVERSATION, WE'VE

152
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:14,604
SEEN TEXTS IN WHICH JOKES WERE

153
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:15,905
BEING MADE ABOUT OUR POLITICAL

154
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:16,406
SYSTEM.

155
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:17,105
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF A

156
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:20,777
QUESTION MARK BEING LAID ON THE

157
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:22,011
TOP LEVEL OF DOJ AND FBI,

158
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:22,979
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE

159
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,646
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT LOOK AT

160
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:26,015
THAT IS WRONG.

161
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,584
THEY WANT JUST AS THAT WAS THEIR

162
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:28,885
INTEREST AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE

163
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,720
TO GO BEFORE THERE IS NOT THIS

164
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:32,789
INTERNAL I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE

165
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,823
THAT WHAT HAPPENS HAPPENS

166
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:35,425
BECAUSE I WANTED TO INSIDE THE

167
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:37,026
DOJ AND OUT WITH THE AMERICAN

168
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:37,427
PEOPLE WANT.

169
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:38,361
THAT'S WHY THESE THINGS ARE

170
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,128
IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

171
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:40,697
SEEN SO MUCH TURNOVER IN MY SO

172
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:43,566
MANY HAVE BEEN FIRED OR LET GO

173
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:46,169
AND WE SEE THIS INVESTIGATION

174
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,536
CONTINUE.

175
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,370
>> Harris: NOW YOU WILL GET AN

176
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,838
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH ROD

177
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,772
ROSENSTEIN, WE WEREN'T SURE EVEN

178
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:51,407
A WEEK AGO IF THAT WAS GOING TO

179
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:52,408
HAPPEN AND NOW IT IS.

180
00:04:52,409 --> 00:00:00,000
FROM THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA,
