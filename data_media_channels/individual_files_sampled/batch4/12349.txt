you know I will never get used to seeing the liberal media defending the Pope it's a very unused to it now with Pope Francis but there has been a with Pope Francis there has been over the years just a drastic change in strategy for the liberal media as it pertains to the Pope up until Pope Francis for as long as the liberal media's existed their strategy has been to paint the Pope as a slobbering dangerous bigot who came here in a time machine from the 11th century and is is his dead set on enslaving mankind you know that's that's basically how the Pope has always been painted than Pope Francis comes along and everything changes so now that Francis has been credibly accused of helping to cover up for a serial sex predator if this same thing had happened its exact same story with someone high-ranking official coming out with this kind of report about say Pope Benedict or even jp2 before him if that had happened the media would be they they'd be having a parade they'd be thrown a parade through the street and they would also be this would be headline news everywhere they'd be obsessed with it'll be the only thing they're talking about now the media has I'm not saying that they've ignored the story about Francis obviously we've all heard about it they've been talking about it and they have made a moderately big deal about it but they have not made as big a deal out of it as it actually is because this is something in the 2,000 years the church has existed this to my knowledge is unprecedented or at least it is extremely extremely extremely rare that you have allegations like this coming from someone as high ranking as Vigano and they're not anonymous he's putting his name to it and he's accusing the Pope of these dastardly deeds and calling from the for him to step down I mean it's just it never happens and not only that but the Catholic Church sex scandal has obviously been an ongoing story for years now in the media and now you have evidence that it goes all the way to the top to the Pope himself I'm telling you if this had happened seven years ago it would be the only thing the media talked about for weeks as opposed to them treating it as you know an important story but not necessarily the most important sort but more than that it's there has been in the liberal media the explicit attempts to defend Francis and circle the wagons around I read for instance in Slate okay that is a rabid left-wing publication they published an article giving us reasons to doubt the claims against Pope Francis and then there was there was a similar thing that I've seen similar things in places like CBS News and then in the New York Times which has no love for the Catholic Church at all they published an article the headline of it is Vatican power struggle bursts into open as conservatives pounced so you know that has been the the the meme is that whenever a liberal which Pope Francis liberal never liberal gets himself into trouble the the story in the media isn't the terrible thing this liberal did or is accused of doing it's look at those awful opportunistic conservatives pouncing on the news so Pope Francis credibly accused of covering up for a serial sex predator and the New York Times their headline is conservatives pounced now let's just briefly review in case I'm sure you've heard the story by now but but in case you're not familiar or you haven't been able to make heads or tails of it yet let's just review this very quickly Jimmy as I said a former high-ranking official in the Catholic Church Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano is essentially the Vatican's ambassador to the United States he claims that Pope Francis personally helped cover up abuses of the degenerate predator Cardinal McCarrick Vigano let all this come out in an 11 page report which he says he was publishing to discharge his conscience so that he can present himself to God in order to to you know present himself to God with a clean conscience is the is the phrase I think he used 77 years old he's preparing to die and so he's letting all this out and then from there he proceeds to nuke the whole network of perverts from orbit basically Logano spends the first half of his report accusing numerous Cardinals and bishops by name then he gets to Francis himself he claims that Francis knew about Cardinal McCarrick took no actions against them he actually lifted sanctions that Pope Benedict had placed on him and since then there's been there's been a lot of talk now about this about this this facet of the accusation this idea that Pope Benedict placed sanctions on McCarrick and then Francis lifted the sanctions now that's something the the fact that there were sanctions on McCarrick is something that began oh says he got secondhand from someone else that person has come forward and said yes it's true he's he's corroborated since then pope benedict's people have reportedly confirmed that there were sanctions and church Milty the website church militant they did a report yesterday where they pointed out they pointed to at least two articles in the news media prior to all this there's one from a few weeks ago and then another from four years ago which makes reference to sanctions or punishments or penalties that were placed on Cardinal McCarrick so it seems very much that there were these sanctions on mckarrick which Francis then lifted even though Francis knew about Cardinal McCarrick and he knew about Cardinal McCarrick first of all because everybody did but second because Vigano talked to him personally and told him personally about what mckarrick had been up to yet Francis kept him in a position on only kept in a position of power and visibility but also but but in fact reinstated him reinstalled him into that position so that he could continue in his Pradesh in a couple of days since these stunning allegations were made there as I said there's been there's been a corroborating testimony from one of the people that was mentioned in Ghana's letter he came out and said it's true there we have the we have the the reported confirmation from Benedict's people then Cardinal Burke and a bishop in Texas have categories that categorized the allegations as credible and called for a thorough investigation then another Bishop Bishop Snyder came out with the strongest reaction yet I think saying that there is quote no reasonable and plausible cause to doubt the truth of the document of Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano no reasonable cause to doubt its truth now he's not saying that he knows for a fact it's true but that is a strong strong statement in fact let me read a little bit he issued a hold this Archbishop Schneider issued a whole statement I won't read the entire thing but he says it is a rare and an extremely grave fact in church history that a bishop accuses publicly and specifically a reigning Pope Catholics all over the world the simple faithful the little ones are deeply shocked and scandalized about recently to scroat disclosed grave cases in which church authorities covered up and protected clerics who committed sexual offenses against minors and against their own subordinates such a historical situation which the church's experience in our days requires absolute transparency on all levels of the church's hierarchy and in first place evidently on behalf of the Pope and and then he goes on to say there's no reason to doubt to doubt the truth content of the claims so it's strong stuff Pope Francis as we talked about yesterday chose not to respond to the allegations at all which is I mean it's deranged he said he's not going to say a word about this and he actually encouraged the public to draw its own conclusions and said quote make your own judgment now I cannot conceive about it it seems inexplicable doesn't if you were now put yourself in in Pope Francis's shoes from it let's let's put a sake of argument that Pope Francis is innocent let's say that you were Pope Francis and you're innocent and you're accused somebody makes up a story about you covering up sexual abuse makes up this whole detailed elaborate story and then you're asked about it by the media you've got cameras you've got a microphone and you're someone says did this happen is there any scenario you can imagine where you would decline to at least deny it where you would say well draw your own conclusions about it oh well he claims that I was that I covered up sexual abuse but you could draw your own conclusion Aereo where an innocent person would decline to issue a denial of a thing that he did not do so there are a lot of reasons to believe that the allegations are true but are they true yeah I have I think in fact I could point to at least seven reasons why I think the allegations are credible seven reasons number one big a nose report is detailed and well documented so it has the marks of something that is true to Vigano is a high-ranking official with lots of knowledge of the inner workings of the church this is this is not some random person this is a this is a high-ranking or was a high-ranking important person he knows what he's talking about three Vigano has everything to lose by lying nothing that I can tell to gain for several trustworthy people have vouched for d√≠ganos credibility five other trustworthy people have vouched for the for the actual for the for the truth of the claims themselves six we have the background now you know we have certain background knowledge of the players involved so we know that some of the people that were accused like mckarrick obviously and guys like Worrell we know that they're they're dishonest and cowards and so we know that and then seven we have total lack of a denial from Pope Francis so I think that those are seven reasonable justifications for believing that these accusations are credible now as I wrote a piece yesterday and I was you know trying to make the case well what what can be done from this point to actually confirm viga knows claims or fully refute them and I think I think for that there are four things that need to happen number one all of the documents letters memos etc that Vigano mentions in his report and he says that there are many out there that will confirm and corroborate what he's saying all of those would have to be released to the public number two every person in the Vatican hierarchy with any knowledge of the situation has to come forward and speak number three a full investigation has to be conducted and number four Pope Francis has to answer these charges personally and not through statements issued by Vatican lawyers because if you work if he declines to comment that he goes back to the comforts of the Vatican few days later he issues some lawyerly statement that is just going to make people even more suspicious now if none of these measures are taken then I think that the Catholic faithful and people all across the world will have no choice but to assume that a cover-up is ongoing and Francis is involved in it he will have left them no other option Pope Francis can no longer be given the benefit of the doubt he can no longer just let this fester let the doubt Fester because if he lets it fester then then I think the benefit of the doubt has to go to Vigano it is up to him now to offer some evidence to prove that these claims are untrue and if he's not going to do that then we have no choice but to assume that they are true and if the allegations are true as I said yesterday Pope Francis has to resign because he would lack the moral capacity to lead and if he will not lead if he will not resign I should say then he has to be pushed out as for pushing the Pope out after I said that yesterday a lot of people have have you know this is I'm not the only one who's been saying this and there are others who have objected saying well there's it's really no way to push a pope out I mean what are you talking about there's no reason to talk about it because it's impossible to do I don't think that's true I think there is a way to get rid of a pope if you want to put it that way that's how you want to phrase it to my knowledge there isn't any mechanism in place to officially have the Pope removed from office so in that in that sense there is nothing we can do but in that same sense we as individuals have little power to have anyone in any context removed from any position you couldn't even get the you couldn't even get rid of the local dominos assistant manager in your neighborhood if you wanted to I mean you you couldn't do it on your own you you personally really cannot remove anyone from anything if we're being honest right you and I are people of with basically no power and on our own we can't remove anyone from anything but as groups we have virtually I think unlimited power in these kinds of situations because if the group is large enough and loud enough and consistent enough it can basically push anyone from any position if the position is dominos assistant manager well then the group probably doesn't need to be that large if the position is is you know if some political office then the the group needs to be much much larger but it can happen for the Pope the group needs to be extremely extremely extremely large but it can happen and this needs to be a group that is armed with prayer and righteous anger if it turns out that the Pope is guilty and it's not looking good for him let's be honest but if these allegations can be confirmed or if there is enough corroboration so as to make the fact completely overwhelmingly clear or if the Pope as I said tries to ignore this completely and thus proves the existence of a cover-up by his lack of denial in his lack of action well then I think it'll be time for Catholics to rise up around the globe to take to the streets organize rallies but pressure on their bishops to to put pressure themselves on the Vatican that's that's what I mean by pressuring pushing it's just a matter if we get to this point I'm not saying we're there yet but if we get to this point then it's a matter of rising up making your anger known and saying this is unacceptable this is intolerable this man does not have the moral capacity to lead and so he must do the right thing and step aside ultimately he has to make that choice on his own but I think I don't even think the most arrogant Pope in the world in the history could remain in office in face of a worldwide backlash from his own ranks maybe I'm wrong but I don't think so so if we reach that point it is not true to say that regular Catholic lay people are powerless they do have quite a lot of power actually and even more power than that when you consider that the Catholic Church largely relies on them for funding so that's power that we have as well and I think we can use it now this there there are many things about this that are unprecedented and the idea of lay people rising up and demanding this kind of change that is I mean that is certainly on precedent that has never happened part of the reason why though that's never happened is because just the situation is different in modern times back in the old days if there was controversy in the church if there was scandal whatever the average guy sitting in a pew probably never would have heard of it the average peasant farmer in 1735 wouldn't have heard of most of these controversies are scandals or if he did hear about them you would have heard about them after the fact after some proclamation or whatever is issued and then he would go oh okay well I guess that's settled but now we have with just the nature of the modern world living in the information age that we do we have insight we have we have a window into all of these machinations as they're ongoing so then as regular people we have a choice to make because do we just sit back and hope that the people and power do the right thing well it's clear we cannot hope for that because that has not been happening then the other choice is to stand up and let our voices be heard and we're calling not in that case we'd be calling not for vengeance not for anything like that but standing for what is true and what is right and demanding that morality and basic order be restored which i think is a very good holy thing so if we reach that point I think there are that is the that is a tool that we have at our disposal and we should not rule out using that tool if we get there thanks for watching thanks for listening everybody god speed
