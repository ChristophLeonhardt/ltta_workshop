during different ideas and different perspectives and you know working with them is how we become closer to the person we want to be and so if you're shielded from things how are you going to reach your maximum potential of who you want to be now tell us I mean you know a lot of people of course have heard the audio tape that you smartly made and what struck me about it Lindsay is and maybe you tell me if I'm not interpreting it right but these Crusaders against bullying seem to like relish the idea that they were bullying you is a three-on-one intellectual Smackdown you know that brought you to the point of Tears what did you take away from that kangaroo court session it showed me that maybe they don't really have the ability to self reflect and that they're not open to exploring other ideas and I think it might just be a product of working at a university is that you're in a line of work where you you work maybe in isolated conditions you're used to the sound of your own voice you work with like-minded people and therefore your ability to see outside of that kind of falters and yet you know what I found fascinating about your story Lindsay is that it seems that your crime was that not so much that you're a Jordan Peterson supporter I don't think you are it was just that you ran a clip from the TV Ontario agenda film without a do-rag or condemnation of Jordan Peterson one of the professor's actually comparing him to Hitler and I just think that in their eyes it seemed that your sin was treating students as adults free-thinking adults yep they'd they don't consider it acceptable that some students might find Peterson's ideas appealing but I I think like I said in my speech I don't know if you heard it but like hearing different ideas and different perspectives and you know working with them is how we become closer to the person we want to be and so if you're shielded from things how are you going to reach your maximum potential of who you want to be you know especially in the university setting isn't this all about debate freedom of thought critical thinking and yet there seems to be an attitude on so many campuses that if you of a contrary thought to the politically correct ideas of the day that is therefore hate speech yeah you know it's just because I showed the clip they told me I was legitimizing those ideas but I mean that's just our fundamental like what I saw in that meeting was just fundamentally a clash of principles like I value that people can think for themselves and come to their own conclusions and I guess that's just not a value anymore for these kind of departments and universities it took several days but the administration has apologized I think it's a bit of a mealy-mouthed apology are you satisfied with the apology that came forward to you I'm I appreciate their apology but it was quite lackluster and unfortunately a little bit insincere and also attempted to distract from the main point which is also what I said in my speech is that by focusing on me apparently needing more mentorship and guidance as a TA well that's not the problem the problem is that you're not letting people come to their own conclusions I mean I think that's a very valid point what were they giving an apology or were they sort of implying that you're kind of sort of still part of the problem in terms of not thinking the way they want you to think yeah they were just doing damage control I think which they had to do you had a great turnout here Lindsay tell me there was a contour protest earlier on across the street it seemed perversely ironic to me that these were people using their freedom of speech to protest for hidup of speech what do you make of this you know I respect that they came out and you know I didn't even get a chance to see their signs or talk to them or anything but I mean it they wouldn't talk to us it shows that like freedom of speech is everyone's value whether you want to be associated with it or not and you know I know I'm talking to the rebel but like there there is connotations of free speech being a right wing thing but it's not it should be everyone's issue and it's unfortunate that it's not and one last thing I think one take away from this whole sordid incident Lindsay is that I personally think if you hadn't had the wherewithal to make an audio recording of this this story would go nowhere would be a classic he said she said oh no she misinterpreted things so maybe going forward anyone else on campus being led into one of these Starr chambers maybe have a video and/or audio recording device with you yep that would be my pragmatic advice unfortunately that it has to come to that point and but I'm glad that my audio was released I was skeptical to release it at first because it is a risk but it people were outraged and some people emailed me and said it even made them cry and tear up and so it really hit home for a lot of people and moving forward what's your future here at Wilfrid Laurier University I don't know if there is a future here 50/50 for now but there with them enjoyment is forever dot media beautiful you
