Laura: JOINING US NOW ARE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY TARGETED BY INVESTIGATORS TANGLED UP IN THAT MESS. INFORMAL PRESIDENTIAL SURVIVOR ROGER STONE, AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK "STONES RULES." AND FILMMAKER DINESH D'SOUZA NATION: CAN WE SAVE AMERICA SECOND TIME" COMES OUT AUGUST 2. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU BOTH ON TONIGHT. DINESH, LET'S START WITH YOU, WHETHER IT'S THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE GOING AFTER THE CHILD FOUNDATION THAT GAVE AWAY $19 MILLION WITH NO OVER HEAD, NO ADMINISTRATOR COSTS, WHICH A LOT OF WEALTHY PEOPLE DO. THEY SET UP THEIR OWN FOUNDATIONS AND DONATE THE MONEY. WHETHER THAT OR WE FIND OUT ABOUT THE BIAS IN PETER STRZOK IN THE MERRY BAND OF PROSECUTORS THE IG REPORT. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE AWAY? WHICH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BE THINKING? I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, LIKE ME, ARE ARRIVING AT THE REALIZATION THAT IN AMERICA TODAY THERE ARE QUITE A FEW CRIMINALS WITH BADGES. GROWING UP AS I DID IN INDIA, WE HAD A LOT OF CORRUPTION AND WE KNEW THERE WERE CRIMINALS ON THE STREET AND THERE WERE CRIMINALS WITH BADGES. THE CRIMINALS WITH BADGES ARE MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE THEY THEY CREPT THE LAW. THEY EXPLOIT THE NEUTRALITY THAT YOU EXPECT OF THEM. THEY PERVERT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, AS PETER STRZOK TRIED TO DO. BY ESSENTIALLY RAKING. THINK ABOUT THIS. THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED. THE FBI ATTEMPTING TO COME IN A SENSE, SHAPE THE OUTCOME OF A DEMOCRATIC ELECTION. THESE ARE TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPENING NOW IN AMERICA. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE REALIZING THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THEM, AND IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO KNOW ABOUT THEM. SOME ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN. Laura: IT'S LIKE YOU'RE OPERATING IN AN ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE IF YOU WATCH ANY OF THE OTHER NETWORKS TONIGHT. IT'S NO BIG DEAL. LET'S MOVE ON TO STORMY DANIELS. ROGER, I HAVE TO READ PART OF THIS REPORT. A LOT OF STUFF NOT BEING COVERED IT ALL AGAIN BY OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS. THIS IS A QUOTE FROM THE REPORT. NOVEMBER 9, 262, TEXT MESSAGE FROM AN UNIDENTIFIED FBI EMPLOYEE. DAY AFTER THE ELECTION. "ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INITIALLY VOTING FOR HER WOULD NOT AND WERE NOT SWAYED BY THE DECISION THE FBI PUT OUT." IN OTHER WORDS, DELETE WEINER EMAILS. TRUMP SUPPORTERS WERE ALL POOR TO MIDDLE-CLASS, UNEDUCATED, LAZY POS FOR THINK HE WILL MAGICALLY GRANT THEM JOBS FOR DOING NOTHING. THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T WATCH THE DEBATES, ARTFULLY EDUCATED ON ITS POLICIES AND ARE STUPIDLY WRAPPED UP IN HIS UNMERITED ENTHUSIASM. HAS ANYTHING EVER ENCAPSULATED, ROGER, THE ELITE DISDAIN FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOW, AND I THINK WHEN WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT, WERE GONNA FIND OUT THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE OBAMA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, THE OBAMA FBI USE THE AUTHORITY AND THE CAPABILITY OF THIS STATE IN A BOGUS DOSSIER TO CONDUCT SURVEILLANCE ON THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT AND TO INFILTRATE HIS CAMPAIGN WITH SPIES. FBI DIRECTOR WRAY TODAY SAID WE RESPECT THE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME, REFUSING TO HAND OVER ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THAT VERY FBI INFILTRATION OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. Laura: DINESH, MAGICALLY JIM COMEY HAS ALREADY WRITTEN AN OP-ED FOR "THE NEW YORK TIMES" " IT'S ALREADY WRITTEN. PUBLISHED TODAY. I'M GOING TO SHARE A SMALL PART. HE SAID "THIS INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT WILL BE USEFUL TO THOUGHTFUL PEOPLE AND AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION AND HISTORICAL RECORD. IT'S DETAILED REPORTS SERVED TO BOTH PROTECT AND BUILD A RESERVOIR OF TRUST AND CREDIBILITY NECESSARY FOR THE DOJ AND THE FBI TO REMAIN STRONG AND INDEPENDENT." WILD. THE MAN HAS LEARNED ZIPPO. YOU SEE THE COLLUSION BETWEEN THE DEEP STATE OPERATING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND ORGANIZATIONS LIKE "THE NEW YORK TIMES" WHICH TIME THESE COUNTERPOINTS TO IMMEDIATELY TRY TO DEFUSE THE IMPACT OF THE IG REPORT. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW HERE, ROGER MENTIONED THE NOTION OF GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. THE TREMENDOUS KIND OF GLEE AND SENSE OF IMMUNITY WITH WHICH THESE AGENTS AT THE HIGH LEVEL OF OPERATING SUGGEST TO ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT DO IT WITHOUT SOMEONE GIVING THE ORDER. THERE'S THE QUESTION FROM THE GODFATHER. WHO GAVE THE ORDER? YOU KNOW, LAURA, THE PHRASE, WHO BENEFITS? WHO GAVE THE ORDER? HILLARY BENEFITS BUT HILLARY CLINTON CLEARLY COULD'VE GIVEN THE ORDER. SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE AND THEN SHE WAS OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT. OBAMA ON THE OTHER HAND GOVERNMENT. OBAMA ON THE OTHER HAND VERY MUCH DID NOT WANT TRUMP TO WIN. HE KNEW THAT TRUMP WOULD TRY TO ERASE HIS LEGACY. VERY EMBARRASSING FOR HIM TO BE SUCCEEDED BY TRUMP. I WONDER IF OBAMA IS THE ONE WHO GAVE THE ORDER. Laura: ROGER, WE HAVE SOME EMAILS TO THAT EFFECT. FINAL THOUGHTS. WE ALREADY FOUND OUT THE PRESIDENT LIED WHEN HE SAID HE FOUND OUT ABOUT HILLARY'S PRIVATE EMAIL SERVERS WHENEVER VIDEO STOOD. NOW I FIND OUT HE'S ONE OF 13 PEOPLE SHE COMMUNICATED WITH ON THE PRIVATE SERVER USING THE PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNT, SO HE LIED ABOUT THAT. WHEN YOU ADD TO THE BACK OF PETER STRZOK SAYS IN ONE OF HIS TEXT MESSAGES THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO KNOW EVERYTHING, THE QUESTION IS VERY CLEAR. WENT TO THE PRESIDENT KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT. HE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION. I THINK HE HAS TO ANSWER IT UNDER OATH TO CONGRESS. Laura: HE IS GOING OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL ALWAYS GOING
