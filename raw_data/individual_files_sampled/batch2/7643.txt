who is the most likely to challenge Donald Trump in the 2020 general election and I'm talking about Democrats well there is a web site known as predicted it's known as a political prediction stock market and what people do is they predict of course who is the person who's most likely to challenge him who is the most who is likely to be the nominee Democratic nominee and unsurprisingly most people think that it's gonna be Bernie Sanders it's unsurprising to us in Washington they're like oh yeah so so yeah I mean I'm I I like this and I hope that it sticks we'll see how it goes but just keep in mind that it's almost 2018 there's a lifetime before the next election a million things could happen I'm hoping that it's Bernie Sanders but who knows who knows how things play out we'll see so the oddsmakers are smart though it's I think they're right to have Kamala Harris at number two and Elizabeth Warren to three I think that's exactly right because a lot of the establishment is coalescing the former Hillary staffers the former Hillary donors around Kamala Harris so it'll be between her and some progressives and the rest of them are like establishment people I happen to think they have no chance like Klobuchar is on the list really okay look uh you know I pick on her a little bit too much cuz it's not like she's there's anything particularly wrong with her it's just a very standard Democrat you know that's wrong yeah and that's what the issue is so coal bechara hasn't electrified any progressives as far as I know she's not out there fighting at the forefront and she might think that's unfair but I broke a where are you leading the charge on any of these giant issues Medicare for all $15 minimum wage college for all so like that's a name that's thrown in there by pundits that in my opinion has no no bearing on reality but when when I read the story on QZ calm okay the media can't help themselves so they're doing a story about how Bernie Sanders is the most likely to win according to the oddsmakers right but they say so far senator Bernie Sanders is in the okay now look benign just by itself but then they went at another cent it's a little bit later on that true I triggered me if you will discuss it they say even so no clear leader of the Democratic Party has emerged since the end of Barack Obama's second term and Hillary Clinton's afid in 2016 what do you mean you just the whole point of the article is showing what the clear leader is right I think look to be fair to the writer at quartz I think the I think what was meant by that was I you know you you haven't seen a Democrat go out and aggressively fight like be kind of like the face of the opposition you know what I'm saying I think that's what they mean I don't think they mean like no there's no leader no I think they mean there there's no one person that's like made a name for themselves after Trump's inauguration I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt we'll see there are two things I think will affect this listen I think the next nominee may not be honest list governor's okay that could be governor's it's a time when they could rise to the surface the governor who's done a great job with his state etc etc the other thing is we don't know what condition the country is gonna be in at that point like for like we've just did the tax cut right now we we noticed Ana you're younger you may not know this every tax cut is followed by a bailout so we got to see when did a banks go broke again you know what I mean and then do we need someone who knows how to fix that or we don't know what this idiot might do by then we it may be a war with North Korea that that has started something or you know you know what I mean so yep it's a long way now we don't know what the issues are gonna be or how much cleanup the next president is gonna have to do cuz that that's what it's gonna be it's going to be like cleanup on aisle United States yeah that's gonna be the next presidents there's a ton of truth in there so for example if the banks of collapse Elizabeth Warren would be in great shape because she warned about the banks over and over again and so it's Bernie though yeah no no I hear you on that uh we don't even know who they're gonna be running yes it could be trumpet could be pence or it could be that Trump left office pence has been president for two years but it's a disaster and then we've got a primary on the Republican side and Rubio's running and everybody else is running so all of those wild scenarios are possible if we're in the middle of war are we going to want to go for someone has more defense policy credentials or go the opposite direction and go we told you not to go in a war let's finally have a peace president rather than a war president right so all those end look I think there was some great progressive leaders that never get any airtime that are not on this list and I'm sure that the media would would laugh and think oh there's no way but there's definitely a way so Nina Turner's not on the list so if if Bernie runs then allies like Nina Turner likely will not run very very very likely I'm just guessing from outside right but if Bernie doesn't run then this list is all wrong you're gonna have a lot of progressives rise up the media will give them no chance but the online community and real voters they're dying for a change so it won't be the regular old folks I just want to make one other comment about Bernie that you know it's it's my personal experience personal opinion but you know sometimes not sometimes every time you're talking to a politician you know like the camera comes on and the even if they're being genuine and what they're saying they they're they're on you know and I mean like there's a certain personality that comes on for the cameras and I was lucky enough to do a panel with Bernie and DC recently and then also a one-on-one interview with Bernie recently which we're gonna publish in January early January and no dudes genuine like they're what you see is what you get camera comes honey's the same exact person and there's something about that that just gives you hope like every time I've talked to him right before I feel like crap I'm like sad and depressed I've just read the news I feel like there's no hope and then after talking to him I'm like oh my god there's hope so that's that's the kind of feeling he gives me and I am imagine a lot of other people feel the same way all right let's have fun let me just do my usual set of pretty boys a minute did we not mention the rock said that he's gonna win yeah he should be on there yeah you know you're laughing you're laughing this is America we are that stupid the rock has a legitimate chance to be president in 2020 yeah and I'm just saying right don't underestimate us okay all that being said if Bernie runs Bernie wins I I know the media thinks no way etc but he has not only this he have huge support among progressives but now the majority of the Democratic Party is completely on his side over 80% of Democrats approve of Bernie Sanders and the third thing that the undercounting completely is the only reason Hillary Clinton won as Bernie close a 60 point lead in one year was name recognition now Bernie has the name recognition so he'll be incredibly hard to compete with so they got all their chips or a lot of their chips in common law Harris and bless her hardin she's an interesting person but she don't have anywhere near the name recognition of Bernie Sanders for once if Bernie runs the establishment would actually be behind the eight-ball they'd be the underdogs and wouldn't that be amazing and I'll had one super last prediction if Bernie doesn't run as someone like Nina Turner runs no let's just say Nina Turner okay she's the head of our revolution if you don't know that was Bernie's group she would have a hundred times better chance of winning than Amy Klobuchar and it's not again no knock on Amy Klobuchar she's just a regular old senator but only people on TV are interested in her Nina would energize people a thousand times more she is a way better chance than any of these regular senators do well I think it's too early for Kamala Harris but when you talk name recognition the rock Johnson not so much but the rock yes you just watch the video by The Young Turks
