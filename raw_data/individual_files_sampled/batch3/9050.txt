MONTH. THERE'S BEEN A 400% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SO-CALLED FAMILY UNITS CROSSING THE BORDER. Sandra: TOM ROBERTS, THANK YOU. UP NEXT WE HAVE A HENRY CUELLAR. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT, IF YOU COULD, RESPOND TO WHAT YOU HEARD OF THERE FROM THE HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY AS SHE TOOK THE MICROPHONE OF THE WHITE HOUSE TO TRY TO CLARIFY WHAT APPEARS TO BE A LOT OF CONFUSION AS TO WHAT IS HAPPENING DOWN AT OUR BORDER. Henry: I'M HERE AT THE BORDER AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH A WATER PATROL FOLKS TODAY. KEEP IN MIND THAT, FROM THE PUBLIC PART OF 2017 UNTIL NOW, THESE KIDS UNACCOMPANIED WITH NO PARENTS HAVE COME INTO THE LOWER RIO GRANDE. 14,500. SO THERE'S NO SEPARATION INVOLVED BECAUSE THEY CAME IN BY THEMSELVES. THE FAMILY UNITS THAT CAME IN ON THE LAST FIVE WEEKS FOR EXAMPLE, ABOUT 1100 OF THEM HAVE BEEN SEPARATED. 700 THEM ARE NOW WITH HHS AND ANOTHER 436 OF THEM WERE TEMPORARILY SEPARATED, BUT THEY ARE BACK WITH THE FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY WERE TAKEN OVER TO BE CHARGED IN SECTION 2325 WHICH IS COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION. SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A SMALL AMOUNT. Sandra: SO YOU ARE DOWN THERE AND WITNESSING WHAT'S HAPPENING, AND TRYING TO TELL US ABOUT THAT. SO WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE DONE? DEMOCRATS ARE POINTING THE FINGER AT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS ADMINISTRATION FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING. KEEP IN MIND, THEY CAME IN THE FIRST TIME WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION. THAT MEANS IT IS A MISDEMEANOR THE SECOND TIME, THE FIRST TIME IT BECOMES A FELONY. THIS IS A 1950 LAW THAT RONALD REAGAN, NIXON, BUSH, OBAMA, THEY NEVER CARRIED THIS OUT. THEY CARRIED IT ONTO A CIVIL PROCESS. SO THEY ARE SAYING THEY ARE MAKING IT A CRIMINAL ASPECT. Sandra: WHAT THAT WOULD BE ABOUT WHAT THE HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY SAID TODAY, SHE'S FAITHFULLY ENFORCING THE LAWS ENACTED BY CONGRESS.
