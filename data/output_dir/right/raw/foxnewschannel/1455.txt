00:00:01,923 --> 00:00:03,925
DELINEATION OF WHAT WOULD BE

3
00:00:03,925 --> 00:00:05,660
REQUIRED OF NORTH KOREA IN ORDER

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,128
FOR THE SUMMIT TO TAKE PLACE.

5
00:00:07,128 --> 00:00:09,564
>> Judge: ALL RIGHT,

6
00:00:09,564 --> 00:00:10,731
THANK YOU, DANIEL.

7
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:11,432
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TOUGH TALK

8
00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:12,133
TODAY WITH NORTH KOREA SHOULD

9
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:17,104
NOT COME AS A SURPRISE, IT'S AN

10
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:17,572
MONTHS.

11
00:00:17,572 --> 00:00:18,005
REMEMBER THIS?

12
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:18,806
>> President Trump: WE ARE

13
00:00:18,806 --> 00:00:19,807
SETTLING, AND WE WILL DO

14
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:20,575
SOMETHING NOW.

15
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:22,910
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, WE HAVE TO

16
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,978
DO SOMETHING.

17
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:26,180
WE CANNOT LET THAT SITUATION

18
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,316
FESTERED, WE CANNOT LET IT

19
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:28,916
HAPPEN.

20
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:32,820
THE LITTLE ROCKET MAN, IS A SICK

21
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,121
PUPPY.

22
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:35,423
NORTH KOREA IS A COUNTRY RULED

23
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:36,123
AS A CULT.

24
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:38,759
AT THE CENTER OF THIS MILITARY

25
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,729
CULT IS A DERANGED BELIEF IN THE

26
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:46,100
LEADER'S DESTINY TO RULE AS

27
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,769
PARENT PROTECTOR OVER A

28
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:51,806
CONQUERED KOREAN PENINSULA, AND

29
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:53,341
AN ENSLAVED KOREAN PEOPLE.

30
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:54,976
THIS MAN WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH

31
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:56,777
WHAT HE IS DOING, BELIEVE ME.

32
00:00:56,777 --> 00:01:02,917
AND IF HE UTTERS ONE THREAT IN

34
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:06,153

35
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:07,221
UTTERING FOR YEARS AND HIS

36
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:09,523
FAMILY HAS BEEN UTTERING FOR

37
00:01:09,523 --> 00:01:10,358
YEARS.

38
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:12,426
OR, IF HE DOES ANYTHING WITH

39
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:14,495
RESPECT TO GUAM OR ANYPLACE ELSE

40
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:16,163
THAT IS AN AMERICAN TERRITORY OR

41
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:18,599
AN AMERICAN ALLY, HE WILL TRULY

42
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,368
REGRET IT.

43
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:22,169
AND HE WILL REGRET IT FAST.

44
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:24,171

YOU HAVE KEPT UP WITH THAT AS I

53
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:39,553
HAVE.

54
00:01:39,553 --> 00:01:42,523
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A GAME OF CHESS

55
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:46,327
AND DO SOMETHING DUMB LIKE THIS

56
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:47,929
IS SOMETHING THAT IS THE WAY

57
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:49,163
NEGOTIATIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN

58
00:01:49,163 --> 00:01:50,364
THE PAST.

59
00:01:50,364 --> 00:01:53,634
GENERAL, I WILL TALK WITH YOU

60
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:55,937
FIRST.

61
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:58,539
THERE IS SOME DESTRUCTION OF

62
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,774
NUCLEAR SITES AND THEY PROMISED

63
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:00,741
TO DESTROY MORE.

64
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:04,312
HAVE WE GIVEN UP ANYTHING IN

65
00:02:04,312 --> 00:02:04,879
EXCHANGE FOR THAT?

66
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,781
>> WE HAVE GIVEN UP NOTHING, WE

67
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:07,882
HAVE GOTTEN EVERYTHING THAT WE

68
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:11,218
COULD HAVE WANTED BEFORE THIS

69
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:11,752
SUMMIT HAPPENED.

70
00:02:11,752 --> 00:02:13,054
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS, THE ART

71
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:16,991
OF THE DEAL IN ACTION HERE,

72
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:17,525
JUDGE.

73
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:19,293
LIVE BEFORE OUR OWN EYES, FOR

74
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:20,394
THOSE WHO DIDN'T READ THE BOOK,

75
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:23,097
THEY GET TO KNOW WATCH THE MOVIE

76
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:23,631
THEY GET TO KNOW WATCH THE MOVI

77
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:23,931
MOVIE.

78
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:24,699
PRESIDENT TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THAT

79
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:27,568
HE IS IN THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF

80
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:32,340
THE WORLD, AND HE MENTIONS

81
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,507
700 BILLION TWICE DURING HIS

82
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:35,543
PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY.

83
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:38,713
THAT NUMBER IS THE SIZE OF OUR

84
00:02:38,713 --> 00:02:40,147
DEFENSE BUDGET.

85
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:42,083
AND THIS WAS STRATEGIC MESSAGING

86
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:42,583
TO NORTH KOREA.

87
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,553
HE UNDERSTANDS A LEVERAGE OF

88
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:48,522
WHAT HE HAS HERE, AND THAT

89
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:49,290
7 BILLION NUMBER IN OUR DEFENSE

90
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,727
BUDGET IS 25 OR 30 TIMES THE

91
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:54,462
SIZE OF THE GROSS DOMESTIC

92
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:55,129
PRODUCT OF NORTH KOREA.

93
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:56,497
SO IF YOU ARE ON THE

94
00:02:56,497 --> 00:02:57,598
NORTH KOREANS DIED AND YOU HEAR

95
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:58,432
THAT NUMBER, THAT'S AN

96
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,536
OVERWHELMING FIGURE.

97
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:04,572
THEN, HE JUST MAGICALLY WEAVES

98
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:06,340
TOGETHER THE DIPLOMATIC

99
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,543
INFORMATION, MILITARY AND

100
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:10,678
ECONOMIC ELEMENTS OF NATIONAL

101
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:11,345
POWER.

102
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:12,747
AND REALLY THAT'S THE MAXIMUM

103
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:15,750
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN THAT HE

104
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,752
REFERENCED IN HIS SPEECH TODAY.

105
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:18,652
>> Judge: ALL RIGHT, BRETT.

106
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:20,521
I WILL GO TO YOU.

107
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:21,756
THE ROLE OF CHINA IN ALL OF

108
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:24,658
THIS, THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO

109
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:27,128
HAVE INDICATED THAT AFTER A

110
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:29,330
SECOND MEETING WITH THE

111
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,931
PRESIDENT OF CHINA, THAT

112
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:31,799
KIM JONG UN SEEMS TO HAVE

113
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:32,733
CHANGED HIS TONE.

114
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:35,102
HE SIGNALED THAT, I BELIEVE IT

115
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:37,772
WAS YESTERDAY.

116
00:03:37,772 --> 00:03:39,540
>> I'VE BEEN PLAYING PUPPET

117
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,242
MASTER THIS WHOLE ENTIRE TIME.

118
00:03:41,242 --> 00:03:44,145
FROM DAY ONE THIS HAS BEEN JUST

119
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:46,347
AS MUCH A NEGOTIATION WITH CHINA

120
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:47,748
AS IT IS WITH NORTH KOREA.

121
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:49,150
DO YOU THINK THAT CHINA WANTS TO

122
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,753
SEE THOUSANDS OF U.S. SOLDIERS

123
00:03:52,753 --> 00:03:53,954
OFF OF THEIR BORDER?

124
00:03:53,954 --> 00:03:55,222
THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING US ALL

125
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:56,924
ALONG AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY

126
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:58,559
CAREFUL WHAT WE DO HERE.

127
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,827
BUT WILL BE HAVE SEEN WITH ALL

128
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:02,763
THESE TALKS IS, WE HAVE BEEN

129
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:03,964
WITNESSING TODAY MASTER CLASS IN

130
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:04,665
NEGOTIATION THAT HAS BEEN

131
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:06,567
PLAYING OUT ON THE WORLD STAGE.

132
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:08,969
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THESE

133
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,572
DEALS ARE ALL ABOUT LEVERAGE.

134
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:12,573
WE ARE THE STRONGEST COUNTRY IN

135
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:13,774
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

136
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:15,776
WE DON'T NEED TO LISTEN TO A

137
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:16,844
COUNTRY, OR BOW DOWN TO A

138
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:21,182
COUNTRY THAT HAS THE ECONOMIC

139
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:23,417
GDP THAT IS LESS THAN THE SIZE

140
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:23,818
OF HONDURAS.

141
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:24,585
SO IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES

142
00:04:24,585 --> 00:04:28,289
TO ALL THESE TALKS THAT TRUMPETS

143
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:29,924
CAREFUL ABOUT BEING TOO

144
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,325
ACCOMMODATING TO KIM JONG UN

145
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:32,159
BECAUSE IT RISKS THIS

146
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,794
RECOGNITION FOR HIM, OF WHAT HE

147
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:34,795
HAS BELIEVED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

148
00:04:34,795 --> 00:04:36,564
ALL ALONG WHEN IT COMES TO

149
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:38,165
HAVING THIS NUCLEAR ARSENAL.

150
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:40,401
THIS DEAL HAS TO GET DONE BUT IT

151
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:44,238
NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT, OR NOT

152
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:45,272
AND IN THE END WE ARE TAKING

153
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:45,906
BACK CONTROL.

154
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:48,375
>> Judge: MICHAEL, I WANTED TO

155
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,376
ASK YOU.

156
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:50,644
THIS MORNING THE PRESIDENT PULLS

157
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:52,780
OUT OF THE SUMMIT.

158
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,782
THE LAST THING TONIGHT IS,

159
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:55,649
NORTH KOREA IS SAYING, WE ARE

160
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:57,384
READY TO SIT DOWN AT EVERY TIME.

161
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:59,920
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR PEOPLE

162
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,956
IN THE MILITARY?

163
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:03,124
THAT IS YOUR BACKGROUND, THAT'S

164
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:03,557
WHO YOU ARE.

165
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:06,927
WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE PENTAGON

166
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:07,928
RIGHT NOW?

167
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:08,929
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SHOWN

168
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:10,131
STRENGTH FROM DAY ONE AS

169
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:11,799
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, AND I THINK

170
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:17,338
HE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON

171
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:18,172
NORTH KOREA AND SENSEI ONE,

172
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:20,374
DESPITE ALL HIS CRITICS.

173
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:23,644
THIS IS NOT PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO

174
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:25,646
WILL TAKE THE OFFER OFF THE

175
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,548
TABLE, PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOWS AND

176
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:30,351
HAS ALWAYS KNOWN THAT DIPLOMACY

177
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,553
NEEDS CREDIBLE USE AND NEEDS A

178
00:05:32,553 --> 00:05:33,320
CREDIBLE THREAT OF MILITARY

179
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,954
FORCE.

180
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:35,856
NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THAT BUT THE

181
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:37,892
NORTH KOREANS HAVE SEEN

182
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:39,793
PRESIDENT TRUMP TRAIN AND EQUIP

183
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:43,531
AND FUND OUR MILITARY.

184
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:46,800
SO HE HAS COME INTO THIS WITH

185
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,136
THREE KEY CONDITIONS, AND THAT

186
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:51,138
MILITARY EXERCISE IS WITH OUR

187
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:52,773
MILITARY ALLIES AND JAPANESE

188
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:54,141
ALLIES WILL CONTINUE.

189
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:56,143
DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS EXACTLY

190
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:58,946
THAT, THAT IT IS FULL VERIFIABLE

191
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:00,648
DENUCLEARIZATION AND THAT KEY

192
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:02,383
HERE IS THE SANCTIONS WILL

193
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:02,750
CONTINUE.

194
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,085
SO WHAT DO I HOPE TO SEE NEXT

195
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:08,155
FROM MY COMMANDER IN CHIEF?

196
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:09,356
ANOTHER ROUND OF SANCTIONS, THE

197
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:11,258
7TH FLEET SITTING OFF THE COAST

198
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:12,560
OF NORTH KOREA.

199
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,963
AND FOR EVERYONE CALLING HIM A

200
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:17,364
WARMONGER, THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY

201
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:17,965
WRONG.

202
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:19,066
THIS PRESIDENT KNOWS ITS

203
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,734
CREDIBLE USE AND THAT THE

204
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:21,869
VETERANS A REALLY LONG.

205
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:26,507
WILL DOES IT ACTUALLY MEAN PEACE

206
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:27,074
WILL DOES IT ACTUALLY MEAN PEAC

207
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:27,374
PEACE?

208
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:29,109
>> Judge: WHAT ABOUT

209
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:31,979
GENERAL KATO, THERE HASN'T BEEN

210
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,048
A FIRING AREA IN LUNGS.

211
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:37,117
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

212
00:06:37,117 --> 00:06:38,886
LEFT THAT WAS REJOICING THIS

213
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:43,857
MORNING, JUST TO DIGRESS, THEY

214
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:45,693
DEFENDED HAMAS, THEY DEFENDED

215
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:49,363
MS-13 AND THEY HAVE DEFENDED NOW

216
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:51,065
KIM JONG UN IN NORTH KOREA, ALL

217
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:52,533
IN THE SAME MONTH.

218
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:54,935
THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING IF YOU

219
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:55,402
THINK ABOUT IT.

220
00:06:55,402 --> 00:07:01,075
BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO ACTION

221
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:02,309
FROM NORTH KOREA MILITARILY.

222
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:04,545
AND AS MICHAEL JUST MENTIONED,

223
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:06,013
WE KEPT DOING OUR MILITARY

224
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:08,949
DRILLS, WE KEPT APPLYING OUR

225
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,919
PRESSURE AND WE ARE TIGHTENING

226
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,754
THE SCREWS EVERY DAY.

227
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:16,357
AND THAT IS THE LEVERAGE THAT

228
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:18,359
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS.

229
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:19,760
AND HE HAS -- KNOWS HE HAS A

230
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,962
AND YOU WALK AWAY FROM THE DEAL

231
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:24,531
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO.

232
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,367
AND IT'S VERY TEXTBOOK WHAT HE

233
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:26,734
IS DOING.

234
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:29,136
SO HE KNOWS HE'S GOT THE

235
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:30,271
LEVERAGE AND HE IS EXECUTING

236
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:32,906
BASED UPON BEING THE LEADER OF

237
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:35,409
THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY IN THE

238
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:37,544
WORLD.

239
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,847
AS OPPOSED TO APOLOGIZING, AND

240
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:41,715
SENDING PALLETS OF CASH TO GET

241
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:45,786
DETAINEES BACK AND ALL OF THAT

242
00:07:45,786 --> 00:07:46,153
INSANITY.

243
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:49,156
>> JUDGE, IF I COULD REMIND

244
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:50,324
EVERYONE, PRESIDENT REAGAN

245
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:51,158
WALKED AWAY FROM THE SUMMIT WHEN

246
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:53,427
I TRIED TO MOVE THE GOALPOST AND

247
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:55,129
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW

248
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:55,763
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ACTING.

249
00:07:55,763 --> 00:07:59,233
>> I ONLY HAVE ABOUT 16 SECONDS

250
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:01,135
LEFT.

251
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:02,736
AS WE CONTINUE WITH THIS TARIFF

252
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:04,772
BACK AND FORTH, CHINA IS SENDING

253
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:07,341
US A SIGNAL, ALSO, BY SAYING

254
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:11,145
THAT WE CAN MANIPULATE

255
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:11,945
KIM JONG UN.

256
00:08:11,945 --> 00:08:12,346
CORRECT?

257
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:13,514
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

258
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,949
AND I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST

259
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,318
PROBLEM, YOU ARE NEGOTIATING

260
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:18,185
WITH A SUPERPOWER.

261
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:20,187
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

262
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:21,155
OUR MILITARY IS READY.

263
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:23,223
YOU HOLD THE CARDS RIGHT NOW AND

264
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:25,125
WE LEFT THIS DEAL ON OUR TERMS.

265
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,393
RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE BEST

266
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:28,395
POSITION WE CAN BE FOR THESE

267
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:29,196
NEGOTIATIONS.

268
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:30,597
IN THE END, THIS DEAL IS MEANT

269
00:08:30,597 --> 00:00:00,000
TO BE FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD TO
