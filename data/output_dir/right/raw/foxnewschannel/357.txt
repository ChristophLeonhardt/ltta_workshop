BREAKING NEWS, OPENING

00:00:02,915 --> 00:00:07,019

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,320

00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:10,189
NEWS, AND THERE IS A LOT, I WANT

6
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:12,292
TO TAKE A MINUTE, I WANT TO SAY

7
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:14,660
SOMETHING.

8
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:15,794
I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED A SPEECH

9
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:18,130
ON THE U.S. SENATE FLOOR THAT

10
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:20,766
WAS AS POWERFUL AS THE SPEECH

11
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:21,500
TODAY GIVEN BY SENATOR COLLINS

12
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:22,668
OF MAINE.

13
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:24,870
HER REMARKS TODAY, I HAVE BEEN

14
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:25,938
INCIDENTALLY.

15
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:27,606
IN TALK RADIO 30 YEARS TOMORROW,

16
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:29,208
I BEGIN MY 23rd YEAR HERE AT FOX

17
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:30,409
NEWS CHANNEL.

18
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,311
I EVER WITNESSED IN THE U.S.

19
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:33,179
IT WAS, FRANKLY, THE BEST SPEECH

20
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,480
SENATE.

21
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:37,316
IT WAS AN EXAMPLE ON HOW ALL

22
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:38,984
SENATORS SHOULD MAKE DECISIONS

23
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:41,187
AND CONDUCT THEMSELVES.

24
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:44,090
SENATOR COLLINS WAS METHODICAL,

25
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:45,825
THOUGHTFUL, RESPECTFUL, CLEARLY
SENATOR COLLINS WAS METHODICAL,

26
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:45,826
THOUGHTFUL, RESPECTFUL, CLEARLY

27
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:47,593
DID HER HOMEWORK, LAID OUT HER

28
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:49,061
JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY.

29
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:50,997
THAT OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

30
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:53,666
SHE SHOWED A GRASP OF THE

31
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,601
CONSTITUTION, SUPREME COURT

32
00:00:55,602 --> 00:00:57,136
PRECEDENT, AND GAVE A CHILLING

33
00:00:57,137 --> 00:00:58,571
AND SAD DESCRIPTION OF THE

34
00:00:58,572 --> 00:00:59,238
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE’RE ALL

35
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,573
LIVING IN TODAY.

36
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:02,175
IT WAS TRULY A MODERN DAY

37
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:03,610
PROFILE IN COURAGE.

38
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:06,012
FRANKLY, I DON’T KNOW SUSAN

39
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:07,513
COLLINS, AND I DON’T KNOW HER

40
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:08,314
WELL AT ALL, I DON’T GET

41
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:09,649
IMPRESSED THAT OFTEN.

42
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,850
THE SPEECH TODAY, FRANKLY, BLEW

43
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:11,818
ME AWAY.

44
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:13,820
SHE SHOULD BE PROUD.

45
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:15,722
FRANKLY, IT HAD A LOT LESS TO DO

46
00:01:15,723 --> 00:01:17,223
WITH HER DECISION, ALTHOUGH

47
00:01:17,224 --> 00:01:17,957
THIS.

48
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,592
THAT’S VERY IMPORTANT IN ALL OF

49
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:23,330
THAN THE PURE HUMAN DECENCY,

50
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:24,998
FAIRNESS, AND PROCESS THAT SHE

51
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:26,499
EMPLOYED TO GET TO HER DECISION.

52
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,036
LET’S TAKE A LOOK.

53
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:33,573
>> TODAY, WE HAVE COME TO THE

54
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:34,574
CONCLUSION OF A COULD BE

55
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:36,409
FIRMATION PROCESS --

56
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,211
CONFIRMATION PROCESS THAT HAS

57
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:40,914
BECOME SO DISFUNCTIONAL, IT

58
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:44,518
LOOKS MORE LIKE A CHARACTER OF A

59
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,355
GUTTER LEVEL POLITICAL CAMPAIGN
LOOKS MORE LIKE A CHARACTER OF A

60
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:48,356
GUTTER LEVEL POLITICAL CAMPAIGN

61
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:52,426
THAN A SOLEMN OCCASION.

62
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:53,594
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS RECEIVED

63
00:01:53,595 --> 00:01:56,997
RAVE REVIEWS FOR HIS 12-YEAR

64
00:01:56,998 --> 00:01:59,299
TRACK RECORD AS THE JUDGE,

65
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,167
INCLUDING FOR HIS JUDICIAL

66
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:02,803
TEMPERAMENT.

67
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:05,239
THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION

68
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,941
GAVE HIM ITS HIGHEST POSSIBLE

69
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:09,977
RATING, IN EVALUATING ANY GIVEN

70
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:13,414
CLAIM OF MISCONDUCT, WE WILL BE
RATING, IN EVALUATING ANY GIVEN

71
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:17,918
CLAIM OF MISCONDUCT, WE WILL BE ILL-SERVED IN THE LONG RUN IF WE

72
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:17,919
ILL-SERVED IN THE LONG RUN IF WE

73
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,254
ABANDON THE PRESUMPTION OF

74
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:21,789
INNOCENCE AND FAIRNESS.

75
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,992
I LISTENED CAREFULLY TO

76
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:27,695
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD’S

77
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:28,462
TESTIMONY BEFORE THE JUDICIARY

78
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:31,732
COMMITTEE.

79
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:35,636
I FOUND HER TESTIMONY TO BE

80
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:36,204
SINCERE, PAINFUL, AND

81
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:39,407
COMPELLING.

82
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:41,676
THE FOUR WITH ITS SHE NAMED

83
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:44,278
COULD NOT CORROBORATE ANY OF THE

84
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,580
COULD NOT -- WITH ITS SHE NAMED

85
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:48,216
COULD NOT CORROBORATE ANY OF THEEVENTS OF THAT EVENING GATHERING

86
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:48,217
EVENTS OF THAT EVENING GATHERING

87
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:48,983
WHERE SHE SAID THE ASSAULT

88
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:53,888
OCCURRED.

89
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:55,690
NONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS

90
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:59,260
PROFESSOR FORD SAYS WERE AT THE

91
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,996
PARTY HAVE ANY RECOLLECTION AT

92
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:04,265
ALL OF THAT NIGHT.

93
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:07,402
THAT PRESIDENT -- THAT PROFESSOR

94
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:10,238
THE FACTS PRESENTED DO NOT MEAN

95
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,241
THAT PRESIDENT -- THAT PROFESSORFORD WAS NOT SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

96
00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:13,242
FORD WAS NOT SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

97
00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:16,444
THAT NIGHT OR AT SOME OTHER

98
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:16,745
TIME.

99
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:21,917
BUT THEY DO LEAD ME TO CONCLUDE

100
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:24,119
THAT THE ALLEGATION FAILED TO

101
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
MEET THE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

102
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:29,291
STANDARD.

103
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,294
THESE CHARGES CAN BARELY PREVENT

104
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,197
THEREFORE, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT

105
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:37,199
THESE CHARGES CAN BARELY PREVENTJUDGE KAVANAUGH FROM SERVING ON

106
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,200
JUDGE KAVANAUGH FROM SERVING ON

107
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,402
THE COURT.

108
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,771
MR. PRESIDENT, I WILL VOTE TO

109
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:45,908
CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

110
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:47,076
>> Sean: I HAVE NOT ALWAYS

111
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:48,711
AGREED WITH SENATOR COLLINS.

112
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:49,812
EVEN SOME THINGS SHE SAID IN HER

113
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,814
SPEECH I DISAGREE WITH IN TERMS
EVEN SOME THINGS SHE SAID IN HER

114
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:51,815
SPEECH I DISAGREE WITH IN TERMS

115
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:52,781
OF PRECEDENT AND THE LAW.

116
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:55,184
THAT’S NOT THE ISSUE.

117
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:56,552
SHE BRAVELY RESTORED COMMON

118
00:03:56,553 --> 00:03:58,220
SENSE, DECENCY TO THE U.S.

119
00:03:58,221 --> 00:03:59,688
SENATE AND LED BY XWAM MANY.

120
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:02,024
AND SHE HAD TO STAND UP TO A

121
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:04,960
VERY ANGRY LEFT WING MOB, AND

122
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,930
SHE STOOD FOR PRINCIPLES THAT

123
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:08,831
MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT.

124
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,099
SHOWED REAL COURAGE.

125
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,100
SHE TOOK THE PROCESS FROM THE

126
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:12,935
BEGINNING SERIOUSLY.

127
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:15,071
SHE PROTECTED THE SANCTITY OF

128
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:16,405
THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.

129
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:17,206
DUE PROCESS, PRESUMPTION OF

130
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:18,808
INNOCENCE.

131
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,543
AND IN DOING SO, SHE EXPOSED

132
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:22,845
WHAT IS THE HYPER PARTISAN

133
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,982
FRANKLY DESTRUCTIVE NATURE OF SO

134
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,116
MANY SMEAR MERCHANTS THAT EXIST
FRANKLY DESTRUCTIVE NATURE OF SO

135
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:27,117
MANY SMEAR MERCHANTS THAT EXIST

136
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:28,418
ON THE LEFT TODAY.

137
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:29,719
AND BY THE WAY, THERE ARE SOME

138
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,554
ON THE RIGHT, TOO.

139
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:33,223
SENATOR LINDSAY GRAHAM, GOING TO

140
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:34,891
BE JOINING NEWS A FEW MINUTES

141
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:36,125
WITH SENATOR TED CRUZ.

142
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:37,660
HE ALSO DESERVED A LOT OF

143
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:39,529
CREDIT.

144
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,731
HIS POWERFUL MOMENT LIT A FIRE

145
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,533
FOR TRUTH, JUSTICE, AND DECENCY

146
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,335
IN THE COUNTRY.

147
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:47,537
MANY DEMOCRATS PROCLAIM THEIR

148
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,340
OPPOSITION TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH

149
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:52,108
WITHIN SECONDS OF HIS

150
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:52,509
NOMINATION.

151
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,543
OTHERS UP ENDED THE HEARINGS

152
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,246
WITH ENDLESS INTERRUPTIONS,

153
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:56,980
GRANDSTANDING, THE WORST OF THE

154
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:57,781
WORST.

155
00:04:57,782 --> 00:05:01,785
WORKS THE OF ALL, MANY DEMOCRATS

156
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:04,588
ACTUALLY WENT ALONG WITH

157
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:06,256
ACCUSING BRETT KAVANAUGH OF EVEN

158
00:05:06,257 --> 00:05:09,359
BEING A IST, A -- A RAPIST, A

159
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,928
GANG IST.

160
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:13,997
NO -- RAPIST.

161
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:14,665
DRUGGING GIRLS ROUTINELY AT

162
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,166
PARTIES.

163
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:18,602
THEY CALLED HIM EVIL.

164
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:20,637
COMPARED HIM TO BILL COSBY.

165
00:05:20,638 --> 00:05:21,405
MEN WERE TOLD TO SIT DOWN AND

166
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:23,440
SHUT UP.

167
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,542
ZERO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE.

168
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:28,879
BASED ON 36-YEAR OLD CLAIMS THAT

169
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,447
WERE BACKED UP BY NOBODY.

170
00:05:30,448 --> 00:05:32,483
THE REPUBLICANS TOOK THIS

171
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:33,517
RIGHTLY SERIOUS, IT’S A SERIOUS

172
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:36,220
TOPIC.

173
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:37,421
LAWMAKERS, SOME OF THEM DIDN’T

174
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:37,721
CARE.

175
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:39,623
THEY WANTED TO RUIN A MAN’S LIFE

176
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:41,025
AND HIS REPUTATION FOREVER.

177
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:43,761
AND I’M PRETTY CERTAIN TONIGHT,

178
00:05:43,762 --> 00:05:45,363
BRETT KAVANAUGH, HIS WIFE, HIS

179
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:47,665
TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS, I’M SURE

180
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,033
THEY’LL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN.

181
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:53,104
WE AS A COUNTRY, COULD NOT

182
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:55,439
REWARD THIS MADNESS, MEANNESS,

183
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,707
INSANITY.

184
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,043
NOW, MANY ON THE LEFT ARE

185
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:00,144
LASHING OUT AT SENATOR COLLINS,

186
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:02,613
PREDICTABLY.

187
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:05,016

00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:38,517
DISGUSTING.

202
00:06:38,518 --> 00:06:41,486
MANY OF THESE SAME PEOPLE THAT

EVER SAID AND DID SUCH THINGS?

209
00:06:53,366 --> 00:06:54,066
VERY DANGEROUS TIME FOR THIS

ALL OVER CAPITOL HILL.

223
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:15,621
THIS IS GETTING DANGEROUS.

224
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:19,458
TAKE A LOOK.

>> Sean: LET ME SAY SOMETHING, I

233
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:01,768
BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE

234
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,303
CLOSE TO THEIR ELECTED

235
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:03,770
REPRESENTATIVES.

236
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:07,107
IT’S SAD WHAT I’M ABOUT TO SAY.

237
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:10,410
BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS HURT, OR

238
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:11,911
WORSE, THESE OFFICE AREAS OF

239
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:13,713
ELECTED OFFICIALS NEED TO BE

240
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:16,249
CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC.

241
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,251
SAD, BUT IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

242
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:19,286
THIS IS DANGEROUS AND OUT OF

243
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:21,154
CONTROL.

244
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:23,924
AND OF COURSE THE LEFT

245
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:25,792
PREDICTABLY, ACTING OUT IN WAYS

246
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:26,827
ON TV THAT ARE FRANKLY

247
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,161
UNCONSCIONABLE.

248
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:29,763
MANY CASES ON SO-CALLED NEWS

249
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:31,064
NETWORKS.

250
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:32,766
TAKE A LOOK.

251
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,334
WHEN, NOT IF, WHEN JUDGE

252
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:35,636
KAVANAUGH HELPS THEM TO CHIP

253
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:37,136
AWAY AT CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING

254
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:38,539

255
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,006
ABORTION RIGHTS, I DON’T THINK

256
00:08:40,008 --> 00:08:41,708
IT’S GOING TO SIT WELL WITH THE

257
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,074
COUNTRY.

258
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:43,710
>> DON’T FORGET THESE PEOPLE

259
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:45,813
WOULD GO TO CHURCH AND THEN GO

260
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:47,214
TO THE LYNCHING AFTER CLOTHING

261
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:48,916
THEMSELVES IN MORALITY.

262
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:49,783
THAT’S WHAT WE SEE TODAY.

263
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:50,851
>> CLEARLY THE REPUBLICANS DON’T

264
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:52,586
CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH.

265
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:54,255
THEY DID ONE INVESTIGATION INTO

266
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:55,322
WHO BRETT KAVANAUGH REALLY WAS,
THEY DID ONE INVESTIGATION INTO

267
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:55,323
WHO BRETT KAVANAUGH REALLY WAS,

268
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:56,790
THAT WAS GUTNESS.

269
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,524
UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE WHERE WE

270
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:58,392
ARE.

271
00:08:58,393 --> 00:09:00,761
THIS IS A TRAVESTY FOR AMERICA.

272
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:01,896
>> THE PROBLEM WITH AMERICA

273
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:04,198
RIGHT NOW, IS THAT WE’VE LOST

274
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,332
THE MORAL COMPASS.

275
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,068
>> Sean: FOR THE LAST 22 DAYS

276
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:08,736
WE, AMERICANS, HAVE WITNESSED

277
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:10,838
WHAT IS AN UNRIVALLED INSANITY,

278
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:12,740
OF MADNESS THAT’S TAKEN OVER.

279
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:15,009
AND IT’S NOW SHAKING THE VERY

280
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,677
CORE PRINCIPLES THAT EVERY ONE

281
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:18,746
OF US, DOESN’T MATTER IF

282
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:20,314
POLITICS, SHOULD BE HOLDING NEAR

283
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:21,849
AND DEAR TO OUR HEARTS.

284
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,885
RULE OF LAW, DUE PROCESS,

285
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:25,586
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

286
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:28,389
DEMOCRATS, WELL, ARE WE GOING TO

287
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,124
REWARD THIS BEHAVIOR?

288
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,126
SHOULDN’T PEOPLE BE FACING

289
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:35,096
CONSEQUENCES FOR WHAT IS RECNESS

290
00:09:35,097 --> 00:09:35,430
ACTIONS?

291
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:36,731
SENATOR FEINSTEIN MAY BE THE

292
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:38,499
SUBJECT OF AN’ICS PROBE, WHO

293
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,769
LEAKED PROFESSOR FORD’S LETTER.

294
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,037
NOW WITH IT TAMPERING

295
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:43,838
INVESTIGATION SHOULD TAKE PLACE

296
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,607
AFTER CLAIMS THAT ONE OF

297
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:47,575
PROFESSOR FORD’S CLOSE FRIENDS,

298
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:49,377
WHO SHE LISTED TO CORROBORATE

299
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:52,213
HER STORY, ADMITTED TO THE FBI

300
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:54,649
SHE WAS BEING PRESSURED INTO

301
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,184
ALTERING HER STATEMENT?

302
00:09:56,185 --> 00:09:59,754
ALL OF THIS ASIDE, IN 32 DAYS,

303
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:01,189
THERE IS NOW, WE’VE ALL LEARNED

304
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,190
SOMETHING.

305
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:04,059
THERE IS SOMETHING A LOT MORE

306
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,861
PROFOUND ON THE BALLOT THAN

307
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:06,528
ANYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT OR

308
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:08,964
TELLING YOU.

309
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:11,900
ON THE ONE SIDE, WE NOW HAVE ONE

310
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:15,437
PARTY IN AMERICA, I WANT TO

311
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:16,271
PURPOSELY EXCLUDE JOE MANCHIN OF

312
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:18,073
WEST VIRGINIA.

313
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:19,775
THAT HAD BECOME A PARTY, THAT

314
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:20,609
HAS BEEN OVERTAKEN BY THE FAR

315
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,277
LEFT.

316
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:23,779
THEY DON’T EVEN HAVE ROOM FOR

317
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,347
JOE LIEBERMAN IN THIS PARTY.

318
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:26,215
REMEMBER WHAT THEY DID TO HIM IN

319
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:27,382
CONNECTICUT.

320
00:10:27,383 --> 00:10:29,118
I’VE KNOWN HIM FOR DECADES.

321
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,185
ONE OF THE NICEST PEOPLE YOU’LL

322
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:31,854
MEET.

323
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:33,922
WE HAVE NOW WITNESSED IN 22 DAYS

324
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:36,659
A TYPE OF GOVERNMENT THAT IS

325
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,261
A PARTY THAT CLEARLY STANDS FOR

326
00:10:39,262 --> 00:10:40,896
ALIEN TO EVERYTHING THAT THIS

327
00:10:40,897 --> 00:10:43,065
COUNTRY WE LOVE WAS FOUNDED ON.

328
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:46,535
A PARTY REJECTING AND SIMPLY

329
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:48,337
JUST HATING WHAT WE ALL THOUGHT

330
00:10:48,338 --> 00:10:50,673
WE AGREED ON.

331
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:51,273
CORE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL

00:10:53,577 --> 00:10:56,379
REJECTING EVEN OUR CONSTITUTION.

334
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,079
DEMANDING FULL AND COMPLETE

335
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,180
CONFORMITY.

336
00:10:58,181 --> 00:11:00,283
YOU DON’T AGREE, GOD HELP YOU.

337
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,919
A PARTY OF BLATANT DOUBLE

338
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,021
STANDARDS THAT CAN REMAIN

339
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:07,456

ELLISON, BILL CLINTON, THEY LOVE

00:11:12,262 --> 00:11:15,465
ABOUT WOMEN’S RIGHTS.

345
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,099
OBVIOUSLY SELECTIVE MORAL

346
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,834
OUTRANL.

SPREAD THROUGH THE COURTS.

349
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:25,074
THEY WANT ACTIVIST JUDGES, THEY

353
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,814
FROM THE COURT.

354
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,248
THEY DON’T WANT SEPARATION OF

355
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:33,416
POWERS.

356
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,285
THIS IS WHAT MADE THIS KWON

357
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:37,287
FIRMATION PROCESS SO POLITICAL.

358
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:39,889
IT SHOULDN’T MATTER TONIGHT,

359
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,225
THERE IS ZERO GLOATING HERE, OR

360
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:43,660
I WANT TO -- WANTED BRETT

00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,262
KAVANAUGH TO WIN.

362
00:11:45,263 --> 00:11:45,996
BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE DESERVED

363
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,264
THE POSITION.

364
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:49,232
AND I THOUGHT I AGREE WITH HIS

365
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:50,467
JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY.

366
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:53,036
I DON’T CARE IF YOU’RE A

367
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:54,037
REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT, LIBERAL,

368
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:55,272
CONSERVATIVE.

369
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:56,974
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE

370
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:59,343
LAST 22 DAYS IN THIS COUNTRY,

371
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,945
THIS IS NOT JUSTICE.

ABSOLUTELY THE SINGLE MOST

413
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,228

417
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:29,701
RIGHT NOW, YOU ASK YOURSELVES,

418
00:13:29,702 --> 00:13:31,803
ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE

419
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:33,905
TWO YEARS AGO?

420
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:36,208
BECAUSE BY EVERY REPORTABLE

00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:37,743
OBJECTIVE DISCERNING MEASURE,

422
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:39,678

MIDDLE OF A RECOVERY AND BOOM

424
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,949
THAT IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD.

425
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,284
WE LEARNED TODAY, UNEMPLOYMENT

426
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:47,186
IN AMERICA, THE RATE DROPPED TO

427
00:13:47,187 --> 00:13:48,954
THE LOWEST POINT IN NEARLY 50

428
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:52,724
YEARS.

429
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:54,660
1969, THE METS WON THE WORLD

430
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:57,596
SERIES, IT’S NOW 3.7%.

431
00:13:57,597 --> 00:13:59,264
WE LEARNED THAT HISPANIC

432
00:13:59,265 --> 00:13:59,999
UNEMPLOYMENT MATCHED THE RECORD

433
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,100
LOW.

434
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:04,503
ADD TO THAT HISTORIC LOW

435
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:05,804
AFRICAN-AMERICANS,

436
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:06,939
ASIAN-AMERICANS, WOMEN IN THE

437
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,473
WORKPLACE AND YOUTH

438
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:08,808
UNEMPLOYMENT.

439
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:10,643
RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT IN 14

440
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:11,410
STATES.

441
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:14,280
LOOK AT MANUFACTURING.

442
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:15,514
MANUFACTURING IS NOW NEAR AN

443
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:17,984
ALL-TIME HIGH.

444
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,385
4 PUN,000 NEW MANUFACTURING

445
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:21,687
JOBS, JOBS THAT THE LAST

446
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:22,421
ADMINISTRATION SAID WERE NEVER

447
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:23,589
COMING BACK.

448
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,257
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AT AN

449
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:26,159
ALL-TIME HIGH.

450
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,327
FOUR MILLION FELLOW CITIZENS,

451
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:30,830
FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN WE

452
00:14:30,831 --> 00:14:32,732
TALKED ABOUT SO MUCH OF IN 2016,

453
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:33,633
FOUR MILLION FEWER ON FOOD

454
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:35,501
STAMPS.

455
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:37,704
FOUR MILLION JOBS CREATED.

456
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:39,439
EIGHT MILLION AMERICANS OUT OF

457
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,772
POVERTY.

458
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:42,909
THE PROMISES OF THE PRESIDENT

459
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,210
THAT HE KEEPS, HIS TAX CUT, THE

460
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:46,212
LARGEST IN HISTORY.

461
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:48,248
BORDER WALL CONSTRUCTION, $3

462
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:49,048
BILLION ALREADY SPENT, HE’S

463
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:50,517
KEEPING THAT PROMISE.

464
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:52,552
THE PROMISE ON NAFTA, THAT WE

465
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:53,753
GET BETTER TRADE DEALS, PULLING

466
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:56,322
OUT OF OBAMA’S CAT SFROFIC

467
00:14:56,323 --> 00:14:58,224
IRANIAN DEAL.

468
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:00,093
LOOK AT THE PROGRESS ON THE

469
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:02,529
KOREAN PENINSULA.

470
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,630
I DON’T SEE MISSILES FLYING OVER

471
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:05,565
JAPAN.

472
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:08,268

AMERICA THAT COULD LITERALLY

00:15:13,674 --> 00:15:15,375
HELP BRING ABOUT MORE PEACE THAN

477
00:15:15,376 --> 00:15:17,044
WE EVER IMAGINED.

478
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:17,844
OF COURSE THE ENGINE OF R

479
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:19,780
ECONOMY.

480
00:15:19,781 --> 00:15:22,983
WE HAVE MORE ENERGY, NATURAL

481
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:25,652
GAS, OIL, AND COAL THAN ALL OF

IF YOU HAD YOUR WAY NONE OF THIS

503
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:01,489
