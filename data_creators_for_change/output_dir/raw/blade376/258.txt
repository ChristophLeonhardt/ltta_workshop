00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,800
started wiping it away and then what I

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,500
found out right was that the mess that

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,180
he was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to clear up didn't go away</font>

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,510
and why was that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was on the</font>

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you know Apple would want me to</font>

38
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,710

48
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,400

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,200
from here to here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get loads of</font>

50

this you're right guys I can't do that

119
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit because there's no connection</font>

120
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,570
between the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work in a in a in a</font>

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,020
nice store apple store whatever safe I

122
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,630
