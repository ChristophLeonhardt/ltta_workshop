Republicans have suffered a major disaster in Alabama and you know what that means that's right it's time to blame the people we disagree with make excuses for the people we agree with demonize large swathes of the American public and political class and do everything else we can to keep from learning from our mistakes so that we don't have to take a hard look at ourselves or change our opinions which would be painful and annoying the most important thing to do in a situation like this is protect your illusions and replace any budding self-awareness with an elaborate fantasy that cuddles your ego and doesn't require any laborious reworking of your personal philosophy or your sense of self some people will tell you now is the time to reassess in order to grow and change and become better and stronger for the future I say what am i a girl by golly when a man makes a mistake he owns up to the fact that it's somebody else's fault mocks and belittles that person relentlessly then moves on to become a wiser and more blindly belligerent human being okay maybe not wiser but you get the general idea the fact is Roy Moore was a great candidate and an honorable man who obviously would have won if more people had voted for him and if he hadn't been a creepy little hypocrite and a terrible candidate but in the smoking ruin of our hopes for a brighter tomorrow I say it's time to proudly lift our heads and look around for half a dozen unrelated rationalizations for this catastrophe that have nothing to do with our own incompetence then one day we too may be exactly like Hillary Clinton trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show so we need also sing see Topsy world is a bit easing it's a wonder don't despair don't despair it's mailbag day it's Mel baby you came in here you thought oh my gosh you know we've lost another vote in the Senate we now have a razor-thin majority full of clowns who don't know how to even handle the majority they have right now I'm depressed I'm sad but but all you have to do is wait till the mail bag gets here and all your problems what we saw political problems we actually have a great question one great question we have today is about the difference between the way then and I handled the Roy Moore situation we addressed the Roy Moore situation excellent excellent question I will answer it at the length and try to get to all your other questions and the answers are guaranteed 100% correct and will change your life on occasion for the better I will say that I'm operating pardon me I'm operating under a slight disadvantage which is that I literally when I say literally I mean literally I'd literally just got off a plane I was giving a speech in Silicon Valley to the conservative form of Silicon Valley which I thought was gonna be like 10 guys in like army helmets like an underground bunker you know Silicon Valley is almost as left-wing as Hollywood but in fact it was a you know a big gathering it was like 300 people very wonderful people fans of the show and fans of The Daily wire just terrific people had a really good time they were great and say thank you went back to the hotel fell asleep for like a two hours the they woke me up at 3 o'clock in the morning got back in a plane flew there and then with LA traffic I had to drive right from the airport here so I really just want to say I should doze off I both swept away when he say thank you to JJ's parents who sent me the tickety blue lunch shop clip they were we're at a Victorian crafts fair and of course tickety-boo

is really great service alright so you know this this is one of those moments nobody likes failure and disaster and you know things going up in smoke but it is one of those moments that you learn from and if you don't learn from it as I see a lot of people already are not learning from it then you know you've wasted the pain the pain is going to be there anyway you might as well use the pain to get to a higher a higher level this was a disaster to lose Alabama is a disaster and I think we have now got to form a mob and go out with torches and find somebody to blame and punish disaster because that's what everybody's gonna be doing but we also have to look at you know when Donald Trump went Donald Trump won everybody else was saying like oh you know this this just proves that everything I was saying even though I got everything wrong it just proves that everything I was saying is true and I said wait a minute like I was wrong I thought hey I thought he was gonna lose after a year I think he's doing a really good job he's an annoying son of a gun but I think he's done a really really good job this part of what my speech was about is like why I think that Donald Trump is a much better president than I gave him credit for or give him credit for being yeah you gotta change your mind it doesn't kill you it really does not kill you to change your mind everybody's so afraid that they'll say that they'll seem weak because they said oh I was wrong now I had to change my mind that's actually where your strength comes from you always should be changing your mind as new facts come in so first of all you know my my take on Roy Moore was I hated him I had nothing to do with this stuff about the girls like I said 30 years I have no way of judging what well it's credible what happened I wasn't there I'll talk about that more in the mailbag of how I feel about sexual scandals and things I'll be trying to be very specific about why I feel the way I feel but I feel the guy is a clown and a hypocrite and posture and a bigot he's also a bigot I mean you know you waive your Bible around and you talk about oh people shouldn't be committing sodomy the only sodomy I'd like to stop is the federal government on me who this guy think shouldn't be sleeping with somebody else and and that that made the sexual that gave the sexual scandal some resonance right because you looked at it and you thought oh you know you're kind of condemning other people then you're chasing these girls around the desk you know it doesn't really go but but the problem for me is that the people who were out there opposing Roy Moore and trying to bring him down even with the sexual fantasy animal trying to gin up the you know passions against him were some of the truly worst people and you want to see you want to see how happy Hollywood was last night what's her name Alyssa Milano is that Milano's reaction he's watching the results come in in Alabama the people of Alabama made this happen they said we do not want this man representing this state this bad man Roy Moore we do not want and they women and women of color they got out there and they voted and they made this happen Alabama Alyssa Milano loves you this is wonderful you know what's so hypocritical about this and what would my whole point about this is she's sitting around with it they stopped this bad man she don't care about this bad man she do you think the people who are out there campaigning against him we're trying to protect the females of Washington DC from the evil predations of Roy Moore that's not what's happening they want the damn vote and now now you know it's a question of when Moore Moore will be seated it will be sometime later this month or early in the new year but now they've got to get that tax bill through you know they've got an and the Democrats I love the Democrat you got to love the the hilarious hypocrisy of the Democrats the Democrats are now making speeches it would be wrong of you to pass just go ahead and pass this tax reform as if we didn't remember Obamacare and Scott Brown coming in at the last but it'll be wrong of you to pass this health care bill and the only thing that the only thing that's a little bit spooky is the idea that the Republicans might listen to him I don't think they will I really don't think they will but but this is I mean it's absurd so that so that's what this is about oh and also we got to show you a Wolf Blitzer because I mean if you think Hollywood was happy what about the news in the news industry this is the news industry the objective CNN that just calls an apple and Apple sees its rocketing out of his shoes as he announces the victory and CNN projects Doug Jones the Democrat he will be the next United States Senator from Alabama he beats Roy Moore in this really really exciting contest Doug Jones comes from behind takes the lead and now CNN projects he will be the next center of first time in 25 years that a Democrat will be elected senator from the state of Alabama a ruby red state a very Republican state but Doug Jones Doug Jones is the winner CNN projects that he is the winner in this race this is a huge moment a huge win for the Democrats a huge setback for the President of the United States they're getting excited over there that Doug Jones headquarters let's go over to Doug Jones headquarters and Alex Marquardt you're there they just got the news we made the projection Doug Jones has been elected the United States Senator from Alabama who was it wolf I didn't catch the name I was the 17th or 18th time you Saturdays I started to think it was might be Doug Jones was it Doug Jones I mean they are so and and this is this is why because they played you they played the voters of Alabama they got them ginned up and and you know it's all one more I'm not gonna say that it's their fault but this is what they do they're Democrats trying to get Democrats elected CNN is our Democrats NBC Democrats CBS ABC these are Democrats trying to get Democrats elected and they do it by diverting you from the moral questions of politics in conflating them with personal moral questions so that you can feel it so that you will get emotional about it and you'll say I can't do it what happened to Doug Jones his people didn't show up people showed up for city people and black people showed up for Doug Jones they didn't show up for Roy Moore and the fact was it was so close that if all the people who had written in another candidate voted for more more would've won which also indicates I mean he didn't he didn't lose because of the write-in votes but it indicates those people writing in were probably people would have voted for more but couldn't do it because of the scandals and all this and and by the way again again I don't like more I just feel people got played because we needed the vote I would have said vote him in then get rid of him you know vote him in then hound him out vote him out this a two-year term until the next election because there's a special election to fill the Attorney General's seat Jeff Sessions he so it's a special election he won't be there long but it's long enough to really wrong-foot what's left of the Trump agenda especially if they don't get that tax bill through Trump my opinion my personal opinion Trump comes out of the smelling like a rose Trump did exactly what I think I would have done he tried to stop it he said he went after Luther strange he supported Luther strange who would have won this thing by a landslide I mean he would what is it like 66 70 percent of Alabama's Republican a lost Alabama you know it's insane so he did the right thing when he realized that he needed that vote he went out and he supported Roy Moore he never said what a great guy he is he just said we need that vote he kept saying it again and again we need this vote vote for Roy Moore because I need the vote with the Democrats not doing anything and now and if you go back he said he tweeted do we have Trump's tweet yeah the reason I originally endorsed Luther strange and his numbers went up mightily when I did is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the general election I was right Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him and here he is here do we have the kind of Trump making the prediction that this was going to happen Luther will definitely win no you know what I'm saying Roy has a very good chance of not winning in the general election it's all about the general don't forget we don't stop here so so you know this this does tell us something both parties right now are incredibly unpopular the parties are incredibly unpopular but I believe they are unpopular for different reasons and this is just my belief because I don't think this shows up in the polls I believe the Democrats are unpopular because of their policies if you watch Obama's numbers they're still very high people like him they like him personally they like Democrats personally more than they like Republicans I think Republicans are unpopular because of the kinds of people they are because they're loud like Trump they're brash they say things that polite people are not supposed to say and I think that this just shows that the people will go so far in either direction they will go to a certain extent with your policies even though they don't like him if they like you and they'll go a certain extent with not like he knew if they liked your policies but they won't go beyond a certain point Roy Moore Roy Moore is is you know his spokesman was on some of this stuff is so comically so his spokesman was on Jake Tapper and the guy what to say about he was like out of a little abner cartoon okay and I don't mean to make fun of the people of Alabama I think you know obviously there are plenty of great people in Alabama but also plenty of simple people who are great in Alabama but this is the guy spokesman he's there to speak for the candidate so first tapper asks him whether Roy Moore thinks that homosexuality should be illegal and the guy instead of answering the right answer which is asked more don't ask me you know I'm just the spokesman says probably you know and then tapper goes after him with a journalist instinct I'm not blaming Tapper for those he goes journalists instinct goes for the throat says what's the punishments supposed to be for for homosexuality look that we get you know we can have this picture in our minds of Roy Moore going around pushing gay people off buildings and then there's this exchange which if for those of you who can't see it I will try and describe it if I can leave my mic on and I'll just try and describe it but for those of you who can watch this dodge more has also said that he doesn't think a Muslim member of Congress should be allowed to be in Congress why under what under what because you have to swear on the Bible you and you you when you are before I had to do it I'm an elected official three terms I had to swear on a Bible you have to swear on a Bible to be an elected official in the United States of America he alleges that a Muslim cannot do that ethically swearing on the Bible you don't actually have to swear on a Christian Bible you can swear on anything really I don't know if you knew that you can swear on a Jewish Bible no three times I'm sure I'm sure you've picked a Bible but the law is not that you have to swear on a Christian Bible that is not the law I know that Donald Trump did it when he when we made him present because he's Christian and he picked it that's what he wanted to that's we wanted to swear in on Ted Crockett with the more campaign good luck tonight thank you so much for being here oh my lord that look on his face is just I mean it's priceless it's priceless now you know how do you sell a candidate like that all right let's let's get down i I think Trump comes out of this smelling fine he's fine they'll obviously go after him for endorsed a pedophile and all this stuff Trump can take care of himself Trump has a certain genius for taking care of himself and I'll if I have time I'll get to that but I do think there is some real blame to go around here and we'll talk about that in just a minute after we talk about your man crates man crates you've got to get a man crate for Christmas I'm telling you I if you are like me when

show if you had only subscribe or if you subscribe right now for a lousy ten bucks a month you too can watch it right on the site and you can ask questions in the mailbag and all your problems will be solved so this thing starts out as a war basically between as Steve Bannon would say I'm using his language of war between Steve Bannon at breitbart.com and Mitch McConnell the Senate leader let's go back let's go back and look at the two sides let's look at Bannon basically declaring war on Mitch McConnell who he sees as the head of the Republican establishment that he despises so much we have to prove the theory of the case down in Alabama this is a test of wills and we're going to determine down there who is more powerful the money of the corporatist are the muscle of the people you know why all the spokes are back there the world's meeting over are they down here taking these photos yeah this is not about me it's not about Sam corker it's not about laura ingraham it's not about tony Perkins it's not about Mark Meadows is not about our beloved commander in chief Donald J Trump they're here because of you they fear you and they fear you because they understand you've had you've had a belly full of it and you're taking your country back now you know Bannen supported what was the name of the other candidate mo Brooks I think it was yeah which was it was a good thing and then when that didn't work out when that didn't work out he could have gone over to the establishment candidate but he hates McConnell's so much so he let's let here McConnell side of the story here this is the way he sees it let's listen to Mitch McConnell talking a while back at a press conference my goal is the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate is to keep us in the majority the way you do that is not complicated you have to nominate people who can actually win because winners make policy and losers go home very simple philosophy that is the way that politicians think you know there's a lot of people now blaming Mitch McConnell for this oh if he had only supported Roy Moore oh if the people had only turned out it's their fault they didn't turn out for Roy Moore you know I said I said people should turn out for Roy Moore and then we'll get rid of them later because we can keep the vote that's the kind of cynical strategic thing to do they didn't do that here's let's just listen to one more representative a Republican Bradley Bern blaming McConnell so you get this this line I think Mitch McConnell is much about this outcome of this race as any other single person in America Mitch McConnell should have stayed out of this race and if he would have we'd have a Republican US Senator coming up there and a Democrat and this is I mean this is kind of the line that Bannon and his crew are selling and it's garbage it is garbage because people you cannot expect people to go against their conscience my conscience looks at the broader political landscape because I don't care what Roy Moore did thirty years ago and and looks at the broader political landscape and says we need the vote it's worth getting this kind of creepy guy in Congress in the Senate for now to get the vote that's my conscience but other people's conscience look another way plus Mitch McConnell is making political calculations as a political expert a man who is one of the hundred people in America who is a senator so you know he's playing in the major leagues he's making political calculations about what's good for his party what's good for the body of the Senate that he loves listen I'm not a part of the Mitch McConnell fan club I think he's you know I think sometimes he's weak sometimes he's tries too hard to to keep to be too strategic sometimes he doesn't do what I want him to do that it's not the question of that it speaks entirely to competence I've you've never heard me running down Bannon for his philosophy some of parts of his philosophy I like some parts of that I don't like I've never talked about him personally because he's always been perfectly pleasant to me but this speaks to competence if you were you know when you'd go around talking about war and this is a war against the establishment you got you got to know what you're doing it's not war it's not war it's politics and in politics your candidate has to convince people to vote for him it's not it's not their job it is not the voters job they get out there and vote for Roy Moore who sends out a clown who thinks that you have to swear on a Christian Bible to get a let to serve in this country which is against the Constitution a religious test is against the Constitution so he doesn't even know what he's talking about it's not up to the people to say oh well he is a kind of a clown and a hypocrite and an idiot but I'm gonna go out and vote for him anyway they have conscience as to they have the right to to follow their conscience you've got to put up a candidate who can win their vote when did somebody not explain that to Steve when didn't somebody not explain that to Bannon this just speaks directly to competence it speaks directly to competence and the thing is the idea that Bannon got Trump elected is wrong the Trump I this is the thing I disagree this here's the thing that I disagree with Ben about that that if Trump had been in this race Trump would have won Trump is a genius of communication I don't care what anybody says it's not a question of whether he's playing 3d chess like I said it's more a question of whether he's a great running back he knows exactly what he's doing he's knows how he's going to communicate and he knows how to get people to see him in a certain way it is an expertise that he has and he's had it all his life he has been dealing with people in negotiating with people and making himself a star all his life if you would put Bannen in this situation this is not a numbers thing if you'd put if you'd put I'm sorry Trump in this situation you've taken this Roy Moore is no Donald Trump it is not the same thing you have to know what you are doing when you're taking on the establishment and banning shows that he didn't if Bannon is for real Bannon now goes home and says I blew this doesn't say Roy Moore doesn't say Mitch McConnell doesn't go on a hannity show and parade around saying oh this is the establishment this is war and we'll come back and another goes home looks in the mirror and says you know what I don't have the skills to do what I want to do how do I get them where do I start who do I talk to who do I converse with Donald Trump should be looking at Benin right now look at this again this is not about affection it's not about personality it's not about politics it's not about philosophy it is simply about competence it is simply about doing what politicians do to win and I think that when you are following the people who supported the guy who lost Alabama for the Republicans right you couldn't get that through your head he lost Alabama there is strong questions of competence they have to be asked they have to be faced that ins gonna have to do it personally and if he doesn't do it Trump's got to do it for him by basically undercutting him at this point Trump has got to go his own way and have some kind of sense of confidence in his own political instincts because they're much better they are much better he would not have lost this race and he did he was right all along every step of the way all right but don't despair you know it's only politics let's go to the mailbag and we'll answer some all right from David I want to go right to this because it is about Morris as you prefer electing than removing more Ben thinks electing him is morally wrong what accounts for such a stark difference between you when your values are so similar and does it cause friction between you well let me answer that first no it doesn't cause friction between us we argue we debate things we are both patriotic men of goodwill who understand that the world looks different to different people we do share most values I think our values are very very similar but we also do look at things differently partly through age partly through upbringing partly through the way we think we think in different ways I'm you know an artist I think in a certain way and Ben is a commentator and a political very insightful political observer he thinks in in different ways than I do here are some things on which we differ that people of goodwill are gonna differ about one is what is our attitudes towards sex and I say that advisedly because I'm talking I'm not talking about sex as sex as an act I'm talking about it as an ethical aspect of humankind I think that that I especially I acknowledge that birth control changed the landscape Ben and I live the same lives were most faithfully married people who love our wives and take it and are devoted to our children devoted to our family lives we understand that that is the happiness plan you know that's the plan you get if you want to live a great life but there's a question about how you react to other people's sex lives and how and what what they do and Ben sort of feels that this is the way I mean I I think today he was talking about feeling homosexuality as a sin and and that's a judgment on other people because he obviously doesn't have that urge and I don't have that urge so I I have a different way of looking at my feeling about sex is is twofold one sex is a strong force in human life it is a strong wind that blows through human life and sometimes people fail to deal with it properly most people at some point in their life fail to deal with it as whether in a big way or in a small way so I don't look at sex as always being indicative of character what the news media is saying to you when they bring up these scandals is that these scandals are indicative of a DES based character a character who should not be making laws so when they tell you Oh Mitt Romney's stuck women and binders mitt want Ron the nonsense genuine nonsense and Mitt Romney bullied somebody in high school Mitt Romney put a dog on his roof they're trying to tell you that this guy this guy's character is bent in some ways and people are looking at to use sexual scandals that way because they we react so strongly to them we have these strong emotions I look at it differently I feel that there since sex is such a strong force especially for men they're riding this this rocket basically and it can be very difficult especially when they're young and they're not as wise as they are when they're older and they're not as calm as they are when they're older I don't always think it is indicative of character if people make a mistake if people get drunk and made a pass they shouldn't have made if people went after a girl who was unhappy with how aggressive they were I don't always think that actually is indicative of character and then it becomes none of my business in the political sphere because I feel that politics is not where I go from moral instruction I do not turn to Donald Trump or Barack Obama or any other senator or congressman for moral instruction in my life that is not what I look for what I look for is freedom I look for them to cut the government back and to follow the Constitution and keep it under control when they don't do that like Barack Obama didn't I don't like them I reject them when they do do it as Donald Trump has done it in spite of all my expectations he has followed the Constitution and cut back the government I support them even if I don't like them I don't have to like the people in government that is another difference between the two of us is where we put politics in human life for me politics is a small part of human life that is only important because it makes the rest of human life possible right politics is something that you shouldn't I have Jonah Goldberg said this the other day and like toad I completely agree with this that politics should be as small in a free country politics should be a small part of human life you should have to think about it every couple of years every election day you should read up on what's going on you should be able to make your decision vote and forget all about it the problem is the growth of the federal government its reach into every aspect of our lives whether a man bakes a cake they just want to bake whether somebody let's let somebody into the bathroom in their school the president in Washington is telling somebody in Alabama or Arkansas who should go into the bathroom and their school because the federal government has gotten so smooth large it has become much more difficult for us to give politics the level of attention it deserves which is about this much a little bit so that now we have to pay more attention because it affects so much of our lives we shouldn't get confused with thinking that this is the moral sphere that this is where the great moral questions are played out really really only one great moral question should be played out in the government sphere and that is how free are you how small can we keep this government how can we solve problems you know here in LA we just have had these massive fires up where I lived just three years ago up in Santa Barbara these fires all my friends have been evacuated these fires are going out of control the fire in LA was started they to say now by a homeless man who the homeless a group of homeless people having a cooking fire that caught fire in the woods and la nobody talks about this very much but la has become a homeless City a city full of homeless camps their tents you go downtown around the city hall and there are tents tent whole tent cities out there I call them Obama Vil's you know there are these encampments of homeless people now that's a question what I say is I look at that is how can we solve this problem because people shouldn't be homeless in this country and most people who are homeless in the country are mentally ill and mentally ill people should not be wandering around free in my opinion how do we solve this and keep people free and not lessen freedom that's the problem the Democrats don't ask that they always say how can government solve this I always say how can we solve this and keep people free those are the questions I want answered from government and I really don't care I really don't care whether they divorce their wives or cheat on their wives I don't even care if Al Franken grabs a girl by the backside now and she's got to turn around and smack him as hard as she can which would end his career right there anyway so that is a difference in the way I look at politics in the way I look at and finally and this is probably the most important thing and the one thing that Ben and I have discussed a number of times and part of this is just age it is just a difference in age I look at time differently I'm not an idealist I am NOT an idealist younger people tend to be idealists they think that there is some way that the world is going to become a better place the world becomes a better place mostly through technology you know technology makes world easier and better but in terms of the big questions the world stays right about the same in terms of how much good and evil there isn't it I'm not an idealist I'm a pragmatist and I realize that time is finite for someone at my age time is really finite man you you know the times winged chariot is right over my shoulder so I realized that every day this is what this is the words I if you go back and look at the video of me and Ben on election day these are the words I spoke to them on the day I said every day is a day what I mean by that is every day that's a good day is a good day and every time if you string enough good days together eventually it's not your problem anymore because you are then dealing with the eternal questions you should have been dealing with all along so I look at politics and I just think one day America one days America is gonna be gone one day freedom's gonna be gone freedom always collapses there is no time in history when freedom has lasted this is what makes me not an idealist I know that I am just trying to save today as a political operative I'm just trying to stay free today and tomorrow and the day after that until I'm gone then it's your problem and that's the and that is the way I look at it so when I look at this Roy Moore I think yeah you know I don't know what he did thirty years ago I really don't I don't think he's gonna rape anybody in Washington DC I don't even think he's gonna chase anybody around I think he's a creep let him come in let's pass the bills that he can pass and throw him out that's just because every day's a day right every day is another day that we can move forward I don't see the the moral the moral issue to me is freedom when it comes to Roy Moore obviously if he's a depraved personality who was doing things right now this is why for me there's a difference between someone who has done something and someone who does something Harvey Weinstein was doing things it was something he was depraved seems to be allegedly I'll say he was an allegedly depraved person who was doing things all the time that's got to be stopped if it's a crime he should be arrested if it is violates the ethics of the body he's a part of he should be ejected and if he does something to a woman that's untoward she ought to knock him out she ought to slap him in the face I mean that is those are the only remedies society is ever going to come up with and it's not right to say silent for 30 years and then come out and make an unfounded allegations and that should cost a guy a job that's not right and it's not due process that it's not there's not you know they said this yesterday they use that word credible you have no way of judging what's credible in that situation so those are things those are attitudes that you know ways of looking at life worldviews I guess you'd call them but Ben and I are different you know have different what we have in common are our love of this country our belief in virtue our belief in God we both share these things and these are the things that that's why there's really not at least on my side I should say there's no friction maybe for all I know Ben is outside the door going to miss out of it I've got a crowbar from the man crate I'm gonna beat that guy but no that's not I really I think Ben is the greatest and I think that we disagree on certain parts of our worldviews all right I knew that was gonna be a long answer but from Daniel Andrew I read your book the great good thing and loved it however I do have one lingering question what did your wife say to the nurse who hit on you while she was giving birth to your first child as I said in the book I can't because it's unprintable all right from let's see from Joshua here's a tough one I yeah I'll take two the brightest star on the entire Internet thank you for your highly informative and entertaining show I debated whether to ask you this question but I decided to seek your wisdom my stepdaughter was molested by her biological father after we found out we quickly got her into counseling good move I can't imagine what she's going through she's an 11 year old girl it's hard enough without being betrayed by your father she's been distant from me and I assume it's because her father ruined her trust in men it breaks my heart to see her this way I try to let her know that I care and worry about her and that I love her so much but I don't feel that I should force her to spend time with me I miss being able to be a whole family and I'll never forgive her father for ruining her life what do you feel is the best way to have a relationship with my stepdaughter and show her that she can trust me I know the saying goes time heals all wounds but I'd like to do more to help her in this rough time in her life first of all you're doing great you're doing great the outcome on these things differs tremendously according to the early reactions to them if a child is molested first of all you shouldn't say that he ruined her life she can get past this this is a bad thing I'm not gonna under play it I'm not gonna minimize it but it it won't ruin her life because it won't her life because of the way you're reacting okay you're doing a great job it it changes the outcome of these disasters whether the people in her life who were close to her believed her trust her react to her and helped her and you were doing all those things and turned to counseling you haven't said that it didn't happen you haven't told her to ignore hopefully you're not sending her back into any situation where her father can get at her again you're at write about the guy he is as low as you think he is he did it he's done a terrible terrible thing he will answer before the judge of all things but right now your job is with this little girl and you're doing great you are given her the cushion of trust she's gonna need it is gonna be tough for you because it's gonna take patience partly you're right he probably did make it hard for her to trust men he probably made it hard for her yeah I talked about this last time we were talking about this is hard for children to reject their parents you know and now maybe she I don't know this to be the case but maybe she feels that by turning to you for the some of the comfort she needs she'll be turning away from him and rejecting him the thing is you're gonna have to wait it out show her do what you're doing show her you love her show her you're there for her show her your support her maybe if she doesn't want to be alone with you be there with your wife and be a presence there with your wife show her by the way you treat this is one of the most important things for kids to especially a little girl show or the way you treat you by the way you treat your wife how you respect her and how you love her and how you do not abuse your power over her if you will I believe come around because of the way your being because you got accounts it just takes patience I mean look being a dad is wonderful I won't call it thankless because it's incredibly rewarding it is incredibly rewarding but there are times being a dad you are on your own there are times when everybody including your wife looks at you and things what are you doing because you have to take the helm and make decisions that people don't like that you know are gonna offer the best this is one of those moments when has a dad and that's what you are you're her dad you're the only father she's gonna have it look it turns out as a dad you are going to have to take the hit and live with her distance and live with her discomfort and live with her distrust until by your actions and by your decency and by your kindness you slowly win her back again you will you're doing a great job you do what you're doing is great let me do one more oh here is from Lord from Steven lord Clavin the wise I have been listening to another kingdom with michael knowles god help us and thus far have enjoyed it immensely I am an avid reader of fantasy and my question is what fantasy writers inspired your writings which ones do you enjoy reading that's a really interesting question because first of all I don't really like fantasy writing that much at for it I loved that I thought The Hobbit was great I finally did get through Lord of the Rings but I just found it excruciating I don't really like CS I love CS Lewis's nonfiction but I don't like his fiction all that much but I do love fairy tales and I have been experimenting for the last several books if you go back and look at a book I wrote called a killer in the wind it's you'll see that it's a hard-boiled American noir mystery story but if you read it carefully you'll see the way fairy tales weave in and out of it and I love fairy tales and I love Arthurian mythology I love Arthurian myths I love Mallory I love cretin the tois I love all the old the Tristan and Isolde poem and I'm steeped in that stuff I know it really well so what I was doing in another Kingdom is I was melding my extensive background and hard-boiled detective fiction and in Alfred Hitchcock suspense fiction with my love of you know medieval fantasy as it was written at that in the Middle Ages more than the ones that have been imitated it in the present I I would like to hear if anybody wants to write in and recommend some really good fantasy I have read a lot more fantasy than I think I have because I've kind of read everything but but like if there's something that I've missed that I would really like let me know and I'll I'll react time there it's possible that I'm not thinking of some books that I do it all right we're almost out of time but let's do a quick tickety-boo news so so I made this speech in in Silicon Valley and it it was really interesting because it was a different speech than I usually make I usually I go and I talk about the culture in terms of big culture in terms of novels in terms of movies to TV and and comedy and the news and all the things the ways the left basically infiltrates our world and eats the moral ground out from under our feet but this time I just talked about something else I talked about personal culture the way the culture affects you in your life by moving what's called the Overton Window which is the window of acceptable discourse of things you're willing to talk about and and one joke I make in almost every speech is I talk about the fact that there is no film in which a valiant brave businessman brings wealth and jobs to a community in spite of the evil EPA environmentalist who tries to stop him with the full force of government and every time I make that joke people laugh because the idea of such a movie is outlandish and I point out it is the plot of ghostbusters essentially the original Ghostbusters but they would never make that movie today and people laugh thinking yes that's silly they would never make that movie but why it but then I point out why not why would they not make it a movie that is actually what happens businessmen do bring jobs and do bring wealth in spite of the fools and bureaucrats at the EPA who try to shut them down over little tiny little things and that the thing is the left has used the culture to move the Overton Window so that we believe Eve all these crazy things and I listed I listed six because in through the looking-glass the Queen says to Alice I practice believing in impossible things and sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast and so I listed six impossible things at the left expects you to believe that make no sense things like that there's no inherent difference between men and women things like we shouldn't be racist because all races are essentially the same but we should support diversity because all races are essentially different now things that make no internal sense and don't describe don't describe the world as it is Islam is the religion of peace which I always loved because the only people who ever say that Islam is the religion of peace for people who being shot at by Muslims you know they say oh yes but but they're not doing it because they're not doing it because it's their belief system they they're doing it because of something I did do you know it's like they're not they're not growing up adults with their own philosophy and motives so I talked about this and I started to compare it and I did this a little bit I brought this up when I was talking to Jonah yesterday I started to compare it to one Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and I don't know if you guys remember One Flew of the Cuckoo's Nest it's about a madhouse the novel by Ken Kesey is wonderful the movie I think won the Academy Awards certainly did one of Jack Nicholson's great performance by isn't like the movie as much as I like the book the book is brilliant and it's about a madhouse where these men are in this madhouse there some of them are committed but some of them can leave but they stay there hiding from the world and their world life is dominated by nurse ratchet and Nurse Ratched is the agent of what one of the characters calls the combine which is the culture the combine is the culture and they all look at her as if she is a loving mother the colour of the big nurse they think of her as a kindly wonderful female maternal presence who takes care of them but in fact she is surrounding them with this cloud of rules and self-doubt and a self-hatred that casts traits them basically it takes away their manhood it takes away their freedom and her rule is finally destroyed by Randall Patrick McMurphy who is a complete lout he is a brawling obscene vulgar violent thoroughly objectionable guy who comes in and breaks the soft tyranny of nurse ratchet and I said that is Donald Trump Donald Trump is Randall Patrick McMurphy the guy the guy who reminds me of and I hate to compare it but I have to is Steve Everett in my novel true crime who is such a bad guy such a obscene poorly behaved rude loudmouth that he can see through the political correctness to the truth of solving a crime and these are the characters that I've been thinking about and obviously people have been thinking about writers and artists have been thinking about for a long time and Donald Trump is that guy and is is a morally complex thing to deal with such a man because Randall Patrick McMurphy in the real world would be a guy you'd want in prison he's a guy who beats people up he is you know a loud and a drunk and all these things that that you might not like if you met him but he is the right man for a job in a madhouse the left's culture has turned America to a certain extent into a madhouse when you can pick up newspapers and read that if you don't date a woman who has a penis you are a bigot you know you're dealing with insanity when you can go to a college and the Liberals have created dormitories for blacks only segregated dormitories you know you are in a madhouse and it's and I think that the people who cannot stand Donald Trump who still can't accept him who still are not won't get used to his offbeat miss and his craziness are not understanding how insane how insane the culture has become and they have bought in to a certain extent to this to that culture and I just think you know I'm starting to feel that for however long Donald Trump is with us it may be he may have done a very very good thing they may have freed us a little bit from this Nurse Ratched culture that was smothering us and if anybody ever looked like Nurse Ratched it was Hillary Clinton all right uh who we got tomorrow tomorrow is the end oh my gosh the end of the week and we've got Christian todos coming on to talk about the movies and the Golden Globe Awards and we will talk about that and many other
