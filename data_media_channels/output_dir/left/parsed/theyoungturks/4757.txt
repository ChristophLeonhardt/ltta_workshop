TED NUGENT IS ACTUALLY ARGUING
THAT HE NEEDS TO STOP
ENGAGING IN HATEFUL RHETORIC AND
HE BELIEVES THAT WE NEED TO
HAVE CIVILIZED DISCOURSE IN THIS
COUNTRY.
KEEP IN MIND THAT TED NUGENT IS
THE SAME PERSON WHO HELD UP
A ASSAULT WEAPONS AND SAID THAT
OBAMA SHOULD SUCK ON IT.
I THINK THAT IS WHAT HE SAID.
HAVE HIS EXACT QUOTE AND ADJUST
THE SECOND BUT HERE'S WHAT
HE JUST RECENTLY SAID ABOUT
HIS RHETORIC THAT I HAVE
REEVALUATED MY APPROACH.
THIS WAS DURING AN INTERVIEW ON
ABC RADIO IN NEW YORK.
HE ALSO SAID, HE WAS A STREET
FIGHTER WHO USED A CERTAIN HARSH
TERMS THAT YOU WEREN'T A STREET
FARM FIGHTER.
YOU SHAFT ON YOURSELF TO AVOID
THE DRAFT.
YOU ARE NOT A STREET FIGHTER,
YOU ARE CAUGHT BUT
NONETHELESS, IT IS INTERESTING
THAT HE IS COMING AT THIS FROM A
SOFTER ANGLE SO I WANT TO MAYBE
POSSIBLY GIVE HIM SOME CREDIT.
HE SAYS AT THE TENDER AGE OF 69,
MY WIFE HAS CONVINCED ME
THAT I JUST CAN'T USE THOSE
HARSH TERMS.
I CANNOT AND I WILL NOT THAT I
ENCOURAGE EVEN MY FRIENDS
OR ENEMIES ON THE LEFT IN THE
DEMOCRAT AND LIBERAL WORLD
THAT WE HAVE GOT TO BE CIVIL TO
EACH OTHER, THAT THE WHOLE
WORLD IS WATCHING AMERICA, WE
HAVE THE GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO
LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF
HAPPINESS, AND WE'VE GOT TO
BE MORE RESPECTFUL TO THE OTHER
SIDE.
BECAUSE I SAID THAT I WOULD
GIVE YOU EXAMPLES OF WHAT HE
SAID IN THE PAST, LET'S GO TO
GRAPHIC 15.
HE HAS CALLED PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA A SUBHUMAN MONGOL AND
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE
HILLARY CLINTON A WORTHLESS
PITCH.
DURING THE 2007 PERFORMANCE,
NUGENT HELD UP WHAT APPEARED TO
BE TO MACHINE GUNS AND SAID THAT
OBAMA COULD SUCK ON MY MACHINE
GUN AND THAT CLINTON COULD RIDE
ONE OF THESE INTO THE SUNSET.
HE ALSO DREW THE ATTENTION TO
THE SECRET SERVICE BACK IN
2012 WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD BE
DEAD OR IN JAIL BY THIS
TIME NEXT YEAR IF OBAMA GOT
REELECTED.
BUT NOW HE REALIZES OR ALLEGES
TO REALIZE THAT HE SHOULDN'T
SPEAK THAT WAY IF HE REALLY
WANTS TO SWITCH UP THE RHETORIC.
I THINK IT IS INTERESTING
THAT HIS WIFE CONVINCED HIM
TO CHANGE AND NOT HIS
CONSCIENCE.
AFTER TALKING TO MY WIFE, BUT
YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING?
I LOVE TO HEAR PEOPLE, I AM FROM
AN AREA WHERE THERE WAS A
LOT OF VIOLENCE THAT I LOVE TO
HEAR PEOPLE START CHANGING
UP, FLIPPING THE SCRIPT WHEN
PEOPLE START GETTING SHOT
THAT THERE LIKE I WANTED TO DO
IT ANYMORE.
ONE OF THEIR OWN GETS SHOT.
WHEN THEY REALIZE HOW MORTAL
AND HOW VULNERABLE AND
ACCESSIBLE ANYBODY CAN BE AT
ANY MOMENT, THEN YOU START
THINKING LET ME STOP PUSHING
ALL THIS HATE BECAUSE THAT
COULD BE ME ON THE OTHER END OF
THAT GUNS ARE
BECAUSE THERE ARE A TON OF
UNHINGED INDIVIDUALS WHO
COULD BE ENCOURAGED BY THE TYPE
OF HATEFUL RHETORIC THAT IS
BEING SPEWED.
I AGREE WITH THAT NOTION.
I THINK WE NEED TO BE MORE CIVIL
WITH ONE ANOTHER ESPECIALLY
THOSE THAT WE DISAGREE WITH.
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN CRAZY,
ESPECIALLY AFTER THIS PAST
ELECTION.
YOU SEE A CHANGE OF RHETORIC
AMONG THOSE WHO WERE ALWAYS
HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD.
I BELIEVE IT WAS DARRELL ISA
BUT RECENTLY A REPORTER
APPROACHED AN ELECTED OFFICIAL
UNJUSTLY ASKED THE QUESTION
IN HIS RESPONSE WAS TO GIVE HER
THE MIDDLE FINGER.
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.
BUT IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO
HANDLE A QUESTION FROM A
REPORTER.
IT'S ALSO NOT APPROPRIATE TO
ASSAULT REPORTED BUT THAT
WOULD BE ELECTED.
WERE NOT GOING TO GET TO THIS
POINT OF BAFFLE CIVIL DISCOURSE
WHEN ONE SIDE, NOT EVERYBODY ON
THE SIDE AND I HAVE GROWN THE
RESPECT I HAVE DEVELOPED FOR THE
FEW REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE BEEN
ADAMANT AND CONSISTENT IN THEIR
CRITICISM OF ALL THAT KIND OF
BEHAVIOR, OF CONGRESSMAN BODY
SLAMMING A REPORTER,
FLIPPING A REPORTER OFTEN ARE
CONSISTENTLY CRITICAL OF
EVERYTHING IN THE TRUMPET
MINISTRATION DOES BECAUSE THEY
KNOW THAT IT IS NOT CONSERVATIVE
AND IT IS MOSTLY NOT AMERICAN.
THERE'S A PRETTY BIG LIST.
I FOLLOW MANY OF THEM ON
TWITTER.
WHERE I HAVE TO CHANGE IS WHEN
THIS ADMINISTRATION IS OVER, I
HOPE MAYBE I WILL LISTEN TO
THOSE GUYS BECAUSE I WILL THINK
OKAY, WE DISAGREE BUT YOU GUYS
ARE NOT INSANE AND YOU
STOOD UP WHEN IT WAS CLEARLY
DIFFICULT TO STAND UP
BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE IS STANDING
UP.
THAT SAID, WE HAVE MILLIONS,
TENS OF MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS WHO DON'T OPERATE FROM
THE SAME FACT SHEET THAT WE
DO AND IT IS NOT TO
INTERPRETATION.
IT IS A FACT SHEET.
IT IS A SHEET OF FACTS AND I
THINK IT IS NOT THERE AND I
THINK IT IS THERE AND IN SO WE
CAN SORT OF GET TO A POINT WERE
WE CAN BASICALLY AGREE,
CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND AN
ARGUMENT COULD BE I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD DESTROY JOBS, IT
IS GOING TO GO TO SLOW AND I
THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A VERY
CAUTIOUS, SLOW APPROACH TO IT.
OKAY, BUT AT LEAST WE ARE
GETTING ARGUING OF THE SAME
SET OF SHEETS.
AT LEAST THE CONVERSATION
STARTS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT THE FACTS ARE
AND THEN WE DEBATE HOW TO FIX
IT YOU WOULD WANT TO FIX IT
IN A LESS AGGRESSIVE WAY THAN
I AND OTHERS ON THE LEFT
WOULD WANT TO FIX IT, BUT OKAY.
THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS, NOT
THAT IT IS MADE UP IN CHINA
DID IT TO DESTROY OUR ECONOMY.
RATE?
THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF
COURSE OF THOUSANDS BUT
EVERY DAY, TRUMP TELLS THESE
CRAZY LIES.
THIS WEEKEND AND I KIND OF
RECOMMEND IT, IT WON'T LAST
FOREVER BUT I FOUND, THE
FOLLOWING THINGS ON TWITTER, TWO
LOOPY CONSERVATIVES TO FOLLOW
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WANT TO KNOW
EVERY DAY, THESE ARE NON-FAMOUS
PEOPLE AND I AM NOT EVEN SURE
THEYíRE REAL PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY
HAVE A LOT OF FOLLOWERS AND THEY
HAVE NO SHOW, SO I AM CURIOUS.
THEY ALSO REALLY GOOD-LOOKING.
I KNOW THIS IS WEIRD, BUT I WAS
LIKE WHAT IS THIS?
EVERYDAY, BECAUSE
I'M GOING TO DO MY
TWITTER FEED IíM LIKE WHAT IS THE
STUFF?
OH, I FOLLOWED HER YESTERDAY.
I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A
WOMAN, BY THE WAY.
NO QUESTION THAT PROMPTED IT.
IíM LIKE, WHY IS THIS PERSON AND I
LOOKED AND I LOOKED MORE
AND I'M TOTALLY CURIOUS.
THEY DON'T FOLLOW ME.
IT'S CRAZY, THE THINGS THAT THEY
SAY.
THE CRAZY INTERPRETATION OF
THE NEWS AND SO MANY FAKE
STORIES FROM WEBSITES THAT I
HAVE NEVER HEARD OF.
STORIES THAT YOU CAN TELL BY THE
HEADLINE AREN'T TRUE, BUT I'M
CURIOUS WHAT THEY ARE READING
AND WHAT THEY ARE BELIEVING AND
FIRST OF ALL REAL QUICK, THIS
WHOLE WORLD OF VIDEOS AND
STORIES ABOUT HOW JEFF
SESSIONS CRUSHED IT IN THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THAT
CRUSHED IT AND PUT AN END
TO ANY NOTION OF COLLUSION
BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA.
BUT YOU ARE LIKE WHAT?
THAT'S AT LEAST INTERPRETATION.
THAT IS AT LEAST NOT, I GUESS
YOU COULD THINK THAT BUT IT
IS SUPER INTERESTING TO FOLLOW.
THERE IS SOMETHING TO WHAT TED
NUGENT SAYS.
I'LL TAKE WHATEVER NUMBER YOU
SAID BEFORE HE SAYS
SOMETHING HATEFUL OR AWFUL, I
WILL TAKE THE UNDERDOG
I THINK ALSO THAT THIS CALL
FOR DIPLOMACY BECAUSE NOW
PEOPLE STARTED TO GET HURT IS
REALLY INTERESTING, BUT YOU
CAN ONLY PUSH THE PEOPLE SO FAR.
PEOPLE HAVE REACHED, YOU THINK
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE
ECONOMY AND PEOPLE'S JOBS IN
HEALTHCARE.
THE PEOPLE CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH
AND YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP
PUSHING THEM AND PUSHING THEM.
YOU WANT US TO BE DIPLOMATIC?
OUR ELDERS ARE NOT BEING CARED
FOR, THE THINGS THAT ARE
HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY THAT
ARE UNBELIEVABLE AND YOUR
PRESIDENT IS ON TWITTER.
THIS YOUNG GIRL JUST GIVEN TO
THE OTHER DAY AND WAS LIKE DO
YOU KNOW HOW MANY SHARES ON IN
TWITTER TROMBONES THAT
DON'T THINK IT'S INTERESTING
THAT EVERYTHING, HE GOES TO
TWITTER 4.
DON'T YOU THINK HE OWNS THE ICE
WHEN I TALK TO THE YOUNG
TURKS, I'M GOING TO TELL THEM TO
GET ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK
IT IS REALLY INTERESTING THAT HE
ALWAYS TAKES THINGS TO TWITTER.
YOU HAVE PRESIDENTS AND
POLITICIANS DOING TWITTER
BEEF LIKE WRAPPERS IN THE 90S.
IT'S GOTTEN TO A POINT, WE LIKE
LORD OF THE FLIES.
AND EVEN THAT I FEEL LIKE IS
UP TO, UP FOR INTERPRETATION
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE THINK OH, HE
IS MORE ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE
HE IS ON TWITTER SO THERE'S MORE
TRANSPARENCY, BUT NO.
HE USES TWITTER IN MY OPINION AS
A WAY OF ESCAPING ANY REAL,
ELABORATING ON HIS POLICIES.
ACTUALLY TALKING TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE IN A DETAILED WAY.
AND 40 CHARACTERS OF NONSENSE,
ANYONE CAN DO THAT.
I FEEL LIKE THAT IS HIS WAY
OF ESCAPING ANY REAL
RESPONSIBILITY THAT HE HAS AS
PRESIDENT ARE
IT'S A WASTE TO HIS BASE
UNFILTERED IMMEDIATELY.
IS EFFECTIVE.
AND THEY BELIEVE HIM.
AS EVIDENCED BY THIS NEW
LITTLE TRICK I'VE GOT WHICH I'M
SURE OTHER PEOPLE CAME UP WITH
FIRST BUT IT IS TOUGH TO READ.
AS LONG AS WE HAVE 99%
OF THE PEOPLE EARNING NONE OF
THE MONEY.
I AM USING THAT AS A SYMBOL OF
THE ECONOMIC DISPARITY BUT
AS LONG AS THAT CONTINUES TO
HAPPEN, AS LONG AS WE
CONTINUE TO BE A COUNTRY WHERE
THE HAVE AND HAVE-NOTS
DIVISION IS GLARING.
WE'VE HAD IT BEFORE, WE'VE
ALWAYS HAD IT.
WE WILL ACCEPT SOME OF IT.
WE GET IT, THIS IS AMERICA.
SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO A
LOT BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE.
I DON'T THINK REASONABLE
AMERICANS, NOBODY WANTS TO
STOP RICH PEOPLE FROM BEING
RICH.
BUT WE'VE CROSSED SOME DANGEROUS
POINTS AND THAT FRUSTRATION THAT
WE SAW IN WASHINGTON AND THAT'S
OBVIOUSLY A CRAZY PERSON JUST
LIKE IT WAS WITH GABBY GIFFORDS,
BUT THAT ANGER IS REAL THAT WE
SAW IN NOVEMBER AND THE IDEA
THAT WE CAN HUG IT OUT IS A
GIGANTIC MISTAKE.
