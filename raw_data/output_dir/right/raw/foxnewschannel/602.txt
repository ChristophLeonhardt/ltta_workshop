OF COURSE, THE LEFT IS TRYING TO

40
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:27,800
I WANT TO GO TO YOUR FIRST.

41
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:29,369
SO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID TO

42
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:36,542
THE INNER-CITY, AND NOW

43
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:37,810
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT IS

44
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:42,348
THE LOWEST IN HISTORY.

45
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:43,516
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SAY THAT

46
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:45,952
DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A GOOD

47
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:49,288
PRESIDENT AT LEAST IN THIS

48
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:49,756
ECONOMY?

49
00:01:49,757 --> 00:01:51,624
>> I'M KIND OF SURPRISED THAT

50
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,326
YOU ARE CHOOSING TODAY'S JOB

51
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:55,728
NUMBER BECAUSE TODAY'S JOB

52
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:56,462
NUMBER IS ALMOST 40,000 BELOW

53
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:59,766
WHAT WAS EXPECTED.

54
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:00,767
>> Janine: THAT'S

55
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:02,435
EXPECTATIONS, THAT DOESN'T MEAN

56
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:03,403
IT'S NOT A PLUS.

57
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:06,973
>> 150,000 IS OKAY.

58
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,847
IN THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE PROUD

59
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:15,948
OF THAT NUMBER.

60
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:17,550
>> Janine: OKAY AUSTIN, I KNOW

61
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,819
YOU HAVE A TOUGH JOB TONIGHT BUT

62
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,454
YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER YOU.

63
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,167
BOARD, I GET IT.

64
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:35,168
BUT LET'S GET BACK INTO THE REAL

65
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:35,535
WORLD.

66
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:37,770
I READ YOUR BOOK AND YOU KNOW

67
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,172
THE PRESIDENT, HE WANTS SUCCESS

68
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:40,873
FOR ALL AMERICANS AND THIS IS

69
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:41,674
WHAT THE LEFT DOESN'T GET IT.

70
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:45,978
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T CARE IF YOU

71
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:47,380
VOTED FOR HIM OR NOT.

72
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,981
YOU COULD HAVE WANTED BERNIE TO

73
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:50,183
BE PRESIDENT OR YOU MAY HAVE

74
00:02:50,184 --> 00:02:51,451
VOTED FOR HILLARY, BUT HE WANTS

75
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:51,984
YOU TO SUCCEED.

76
00:02:51,985 --> 00:02:54,454
HE WANTS YOU TO BE SAFE AND HE

77
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:55,788
WANTS YOU TO PROSPER.

78
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:56,355
THAT'S A PRESIDENT.

79
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:59,425
AND THE LEFT WILL NEVER BELIEVE

80
00:02:59,426 --> 00:02:59,692
IT.

81
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:01,561
>> Janine: LET ME ASK YOU THIS

82
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:03,463
AUSTIN, WHEN THE DEMOCRATS START

83
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:04,530
RUNNING, AND THEY ARE RUNNING

84
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:05,765
NOW WHICH IS WHY THE PRESIDENT

85
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:08,568
HAS ALREADY STARTED THIS PUSH.

86
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:10,603
DO THEY JUST IGNORE THE ECONOMY,

87
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:14,474
POOR DO THEY TALK ABOUT MAYBE

88
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:16,175
ISIS COMING BACK?

89
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:17,777
WHAT DO THEY SAY?

90
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:19,745
>> I THINK WHAT THEY WOULD SAY

91
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:20,746
IS THE NUMBERS YOU'VE QUOTED

92
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:23,382
WHERE YOU SAY MORE THAN

93
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:24,116
4 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN A

94
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:25,551
RAISE.

95
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:26,252
AS 150 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE

96
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:26,586
COUNTRY.

97
00:03:26,587 --> 00:03:28,754
IF YOU LOOK AT JOB CREATION

98
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:30,189
RATES OR WAGE GROWTH, BOTH OF

99
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,290
THOSE HAVE ACTUALLY SLOWED DOWN

100
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,259
IN THE 18 MONTHS THAT WE'VE BEEN

101
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,193
UNDER DONALD TRUMP.

102
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:36,395
SO I THINK THEY WILL PROBABLY

103
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:37,230
HIGHLIGHT THOSE FACTS.

104
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:39,699
>> Janine: AND DO YOU THINK

105
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,767
THAT AMERICA -- I'M GOING TO LET

106
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:42,368
SEBASTIAN ANSWER THAT.

107
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:44,170
DO YOU THINK AMERICA ACTUALLY

108
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:47,974
AGREES WITH NANCY ABOUT, IT'S

109
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:48,407
JUST PROBLEMS.

110
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:50,576
WOULD THEY RATHER NOT SEE EXTRA

111
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:54,780
MONEY IN THEIR PAYCHECKS?

112
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:56,916
>> AFTER YOU COME AUSTIN.

113
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:00,620
THE ONE I THOUGHT YOU -- >> I

114
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:07,860
THE ECONOMY IS THE LOWEST THAT

115
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:09,395
IT'S EVER BEEN.

116
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:13,299
>> TRUMP SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT

117
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:23,976
UP.

118
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:25,378
>> SO WHAT SHOULD AUSTIN AND HIS

119
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:27,179
CADRE SAY TO THE FACT THAT WE

120
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,347
HAVE THE LOWEST MINORITY

121
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:28,848
UNEMPLOYMENT SINCE

122
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:31,183
RECORD-KEEPING BEGAN?

123
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:32,184
YOU CAN'T SPIN THAT.

124
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:35,121
YOU CAN'T SAY, THE GROWTH HAS

125
00:04:35,122 --> 00:04:35,521
DECELERATED.

126
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:40,359
WHO CARES.

127
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,764
WE HAVE OIL COMPANIES THAT ARE

128
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:45,765
GIVING $25,000 SIGNING BONUSES

129
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:47,800
IN AMERICA AND THAT IS AN

130
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:48,768
ECONOMY UNLEASHED.

131
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:55,408
WE HAVE BASICALLY FICTIONAL ZERO

132
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:56,375
UNEMPLOYMENT.

133
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:58,277
WE HAVE MORE JOBS AVAILABLE AND

134
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:04,884
PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS, THE LONGEST

135
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:06,385
STREAK EVER.

136
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:07,386
ABOUT 18 OF THOSE MONTHS WERE

137
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:09,188
UNDER DONALD TRUMP AND THE REST

138
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:10,189
WERE UNDER BARACK OBAMA.

139
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,758
AND IT'S GREAT, I'M TOTALLY FOR

140
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:19,465
GDP GROWTH.

141
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:22,835
>> Janine: SAY THAT AGAIN

142
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:23,169
AUSTIN?

143
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,172
>> SO YOU ARE SAYING WE DON'T

144
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:29,709
HAVE -- >> A GROWTH RATE OF 3%.

145
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:37,149
>> SO FOR ONE QUARTER -- IT

146
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,384
HAPPENED FOUR DIFFERENT TIMES.

147
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:39,919
>> HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

148
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,723
BARACK OBAMA HAD US CONVINCED

149
00:05:43,724 --> 00:05:46,359
THAT 1% GDP WAS THE NEW NORMAL.

150
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,159
THOSE BOZOS ACTUALLY BELIEVED

151
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,998
THAT WE ARE NOW AT 4.1.

152
00:05:51,999 --> 00:00:00,000
>> I BELIEVE THAT'S NOT CORRECT.
