DEAL.
HOW EXACTLY ARE YOU GOING TO
NEGOTIATE THAT.
JESSE: JOBS HAVE BEEN COMING
BACK IN A HUGE WAY.
DONALD TRUMP DOUBLED THE
MANUFACTURING JOBS OBAMA HAD
SINCE TAKING OFFICE ON A MONTHLY
BASIS.
THE SON OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, ERIC
TRUMP.
I THINK HE SAID IT ON TWITTER
THE OTHER DAY, JOBS VERSUS
MOB'S.
>> YOU KNOW WHY HE GOT JOBS BACK
AND OBAMA COULDN'T?
BECAUSE HE IS A BUSINESSMAN.
WE HAVE THE BEST ECONOMY
PRACTICALLY WE HAVE EVER SEEN.
WE HAVE MARKETS AT RECORD HIGHS.
GO COUNT LIST.
401Ks ARE GOING CRAZY.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T
NECESSARILY LIKE HIM SAY AMERICA
IS THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE
WORLD.
JESSE: LOOK AT SOME OF THESE
NUMBERS.
STEEL WORKERS GETTING A 14%
RAISE.
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS BEST
CITY FOR JOBS RIGHT NOW, WE ARE
TALKING PITTSBURGH, ST. LOUIS,
INDIANAPOLIS, CINCINNATI,
HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT.
LOOK AT THESE TOWNS ACROSS
AMERICA.
THIS IS A WIDE SWATH OF SUCCESS
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BLUE COLLAR,
MIDDLE CLASS JOBS.
>> DEMOCRATS FORGOT ABOUT THE
RUST BELT AND THEY DID
EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO
UNDERMINE THE RUST BELT.
THEY TOOK ON THE TEAL WORKERS
AND COAL WORKERS.
THE COMPANIES THAT WERE
SHUTTERED AND CLOSED.
THEY ALL WENT OVERSEAS.
THEY WENT TO MEXICO AND CHINA.
WE REBUILT THOSE COUNTRIES AT
BEHEST OF THE AMERICAN WORKER.
YOU HAVE 3.7% UNEMPLOYMENT.
MORE AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND
HISPANICS AND FEMALES HE REPLIED
THAN ANY TIME IN HISTORY.
THEY HAVE BENEFITS AND THE
COUNTRY IS DOING AMAZINGLY WELL.
WE ARE THE ENVY OF THE REST OF
THE WORLD.
AND HERE YOU HAVE OBAMA SAYING A
FEW YEARS AGO, WHO IS TRUMP
GOING TO MAGICALLY -- WE NEED
MORE BUSINESS PEOPLE IN
WASHINGTON.
JESSE: TRUMP IS LIKE HE KILLA,
HE ALWAYS WINS.
-- IS LIKE TEQUILLA, HE ALWAYS
WINS.
YOUR FATHER SAYS POKE
YOUR FATHER SAYS POCE
YOUR FATHER SAYS POCAHONTAS.
SHE IS 1/1000 POSSIBLY NATIVE
AMERICAN.
THIS IS WHAT YOUR FATHER HAD TO
SAY ABOUT HER.
LET'S ROLL IT.
>> SHE OWES THE COUNTRY AN
APOLOGY.
WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE?
1/1000?
>> I DON'T HAVE THE PERCENTAGE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: IF SHE GETS THE
NOMINATION, I WILL ONLY DO IT IF
I CAN TEST HER PERSONALLY.
THAT WILL NOT BE SOMETHING I
ENJOY DOING, EITHER.
>> IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY WORSE THAN
THAT.
SHE IS WRITING POWWOW CHOW
COOKBOOKS.
JESSE: SHE HAS A COOKBOOK,
POWWOW CHOW.
AND SHE CALLS HERSELF A CHEROKEE
INDIAN IN THE COOKBOOK.
ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST
A LOT OF THESE SO-CALLED RECIPES
LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE LIFTED FROM
OTHER RECIPE BOOKS.
>> SHE PLAGIARIZED THE BOOK AND
BLANK RISED HERB OWN DNA.
GIVE ME A BREAK.
YOU ARE 1/1000.
YOU ARE LESS NATIVE AMERICAN
THAN I AM.
JESSE: I WAS .1% BLACK.
IMAGINE IF I WENT AROUND TELLING
EVERYBODY I WAS BLACK?
>> EVEN THE CHEROKEE INDIANS SAY
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
SHE WAS USING IT AS A WAY TO
ADVANCE HER CAREER AND GET A
BETTER JOB.
JESSE: ALL THE LEFT-WING PRESS,
ARTICLE AFTER ARTICLE, SHE SHOT
HERSELF IN THE FOOT, SHE IS NOT
A SERIOUS CANDIDATE ANYMORE.
IT'S WIDELY ACCEPTED SHE IS NOT
GOING TO GET THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINATION.
IT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE SHE WOULD
HAVE MADE A GREAT OPPONENT FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CARAVAN.
THE AP IS REPORTING THE CARAVAN
HEADING NORTH TOWARDS OUR
SOUTHERN BORDER HAS ALLEGEDLY
BEEN TURNED AROUND.
I KNOW YOUR FATHER SAID HE WAS
GOING TO CUT OFF AID AND SEND
THE MILITARY.
THIS IS A BIG WIN.
>> IT IS.
HE TOLD THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE
ARE COMING FROM.
WE GIVE YOU A LOT OF FINANCIAL
AID.
AND GUESS WHAT?
WE ARE NOT GIVING YOU THAT AID
IF YOU DON'T FAKE CARE OF THIS
PROBLEM.
WE DON'T WANT TO INHERIT YOUR
PROBLEM WHILE WE GIVE YOU AID.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE
HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH
MEXICO IN A LONG TIME.
THEY ALWAYS THROW OUT TRUMP IS
ANTI-HISPANIC.
TRUMP HAS AN UNBELIEVABLE
RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO.
JESSE: YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN
EUROPE WHEN THEY HAD ALL THE
MIGRANTS FLOOD IN.
IT'S SOMETHING MERKEL SAID SHE
REGRETS.
YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE SAME
MISTAKE PRICE.
ROSIE O'DONNELL IS BACK.
>> WHEN HE WAS ELECTED I WROTE
ON TWITTER WE SHOULD IMPOSE
MARTIAL LAW UNTIL WE ARE SURE
THE RUSSIANS WEREN'T INVOLVED IN
THE VOTE.
>> HE WANTS TO SEND THE MILITARY
TO THE BORDER.
>> I WANT TO SEND THE MILITARY
TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
JESSE: COULD YOU IMAGINE IF YOU
HAD SAID ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP
WE SHOULD SEND THE MILITARY TO
THE WHITE HOUSE AND TAKE HIM
OUT?
>> GAME OVER.
>> SHE APPEARS EVERY TWO MONTHS
AND EMBARRASSES HERSELF.
THEN SHE REAPPEARS AND EMBARRASS
HERSELF.
IT'S LIKE A GAME OF
WHACK-A-MOLE.
THIS COUNTRY DESPITE THE
NONSENSE AND NOISE AND RHETORIC,
THIS COUNTRY IS DOING SO WELL.
AMERICA HAS NEVER DONE BETTER.
BY EVERY METRIC, WE ARE
CRUSHING.
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THESE PEOPLE
GOT ON BOARD?
WE MIGHT DIFFER ON THIS THING.
BUT LET'S PUSH FORWARD.
WE ARE THRIVING AS A NATION.
JESSE: THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS
NEVER GOING TO REACH ACROSS THE
AISLE.
DO YOU THINK THAT WILL HELP
BECAUSE THERE IS SUCH
OBSTRUCTIONISTS?
>> THEY MIGHT HAVE $ -- THE LEFT
HAS BECOME A MOB.
YOU SEE THEM LIGHTING PICKUP
TRUCKS ON FIRE.
YELLING AT PEOPLE IN RESTAURANTS
WHEN THEY ARE GOING OUT TO A
NICE DINNER WITH THEIR WIVES,
THE ONE DAY A WEEK, WITH TED
CRUZ.
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED.
SCRATCHING AT THE SUPREME COURT
DOORS.
PEOPLE AREN'T INTO THIS STUFF.
PEOPLE WANT CIVILITY.
JESSE: IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE THE
LEFT ACCUSED PRESIDENT TRUMP OF
BEING UNCIVIL.
BUT EVERY TIME THEY GO OUTSIDE
IN PUBLIC THEY ARE THE MOST OF
UNCIVILIZED PEOPLE.
THEY FIRE BOMBED A LIMOUSINE
DURING THE INAUGURATION.
SOMEONE WAS ALMOST STABBED WHEN
HE WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE.
THERE WAS A PERSON RUNNING FOR
OFFICE IN MINNESOTA WHO WAS
PUNCHED IN THE FACE AND GIVEN A
CONCUSSION.
THESE ARE HARD-CORE JAJ DAY
TORES.
>> THEY WANT TO DOUBLE TAXES.
THEY WANTED TO ELIMINATE LAW
ENFORCEMENT AND ATTACK PLASTIC
STRAWS.
JESSE: SAVE OUR STRAWS.
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.
HE'S DOING AN UNBELIEVABLE JOB.
