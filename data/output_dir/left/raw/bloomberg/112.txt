1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,200
Venezuela does not have enough food to feed
its 30 million residents.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,629
It also can’t guarantee them electricity.

3
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:09,590
Or medical supplies in its hospitals.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,040
It’s a country staring down social upheaval,
political unrest, and bordering on economic

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,500
collapse.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,760
States of emergency have been declared.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,580
So how did this happen to the country with
the largest oil reserves in the world?

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,570
For years, subsidized oil bought Venezuela’s
government influence abroad and popular support

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,570
at home.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,520
But collapsing oil revenue in an economy dependent
on it has caused civil unrest and calls for

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,370
the ouster of the unpopular President Nicholas
Maduro.

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,620
Maduro has responded with mostly successful
attempts to consolidate his power and squash

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,699
opposition, nudging Venezuela’s democracy
towards dictatorship.

14
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:47,530
Here’s the situation…

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,789
Venezuela’s current crisis started long
before Maduro with his predecessor, the late

16
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:53,339
President Hugo Chavez.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,710
Chavez revolutionized Venezuelan politics
with a left-wing ideology called “Chavismo”and

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,280
a fiery anti-U.S. rhetoric,
While in power, Chavez focused all

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,220
the country’s resources on one thing: producing
oil.

20
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,760
This meant that almost everything Venezuela
consumed besides oil needed to be imported.

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,190
And Chavez borrowed a lot of foreign money
to fund it all.

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,060
While oil prices were high, it worked.

23
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,150
Then, in 2013, the first domino fell: Chavez
died.

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,330
Maduro took over for Chavez, and in 2014,
the second domino fell: the price of oil started

25
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,610
to crumble.

26
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,860
Revenue from oil accounts for 95 percent of
Venezuela’s export earnings, and when prices

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,650
for the commodity began plummeting, Venezuela
found itself suddenly short on cash.

28
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,830
The government responded by slashing imports
like basic groceries and medical supplies

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,310
to avoid defaulting on its foreign debt.

30
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,740
It also started printing money causing inflation
to surge into the triple digits without an

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,440
end in sight.

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,160
The economic freefall has exacerbated social problems

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,820
It's gotten so bad that food shortages prompted
major riots.

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,610
A coalition opposed to Maduro won a majority
in the National Assembly in 2015 but its attempts

35
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,730
to remove the President from office have failed.

36
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,369
Maduro recently forced the formation of a
task group called ‘la constituyente’ to

37
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:11,430
rewrite the country’s constitution.

38
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:19,069
Less than a day later, he had two opposition leaders thrown back in jail, snatched from their homes at gunpoint in a midnight raid

39
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,569
And then there is the July 30th election.

40
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,319
All of the opposition candidates boycotted
so the only options was to vote for presumed

41
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,560
Maduro allies.

42
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,950
The assembly has broad powers including oversight
of every other branch of government.

43
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,640
After the election, the U.S. Treasury imposed
sanctions on Maduro's assets.

44
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,610
All assets of Maduro subject to U.S. jurisdiction
are frozen.

45
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,900
The U.S. is Venezuela’s largest oil consumer,
so wider sanctions would almost certainly

46
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,500
be devastating

47
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,440
Now here's the argument

48
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,120
Maduro's critics say that he has botched the presidency so badly he should resign immediately.

49
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,240
However some say the alternative isn't much better

50
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,960
The opposition alliance is made up of more than a dozen political parties with no unified plan to fix the economy,

51
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:06,279
and no leader to do it.

52
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:11,030
Venezuela owes almost $90 billion in foreign
debt over the next 10 years, and oil prices

53
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,150
aren’t likely to hit the previous highs
that kept the nation afloat, raising chances

54
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,019
that the country could default.

55
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,530
For now, citizens are stuck with a failing
economy and a leader focused largely on staying

56
00:03:21,530 --> 00:00:00,000
in power.
