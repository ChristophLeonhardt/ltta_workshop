the NDP just announced a new law to limit third-party advertisers and because of that now is the time for me to go public with a brand new fight for press freedom that we have at the rebel with Rachel Notley elections Alberta describes third-party advertisers as a person corporation or group which is required to register when it occurs or plans to incur expenses of at least a thousand bucks in elections advertising or has accepted or plans to accept at least a thousand bucks in elections advertising donations now you might hear these groups often described as political action committees or PACs they're groups like unite Alberta Alberta can't wait they can be Union front groups like Friends of Medicare and even unions themselves like the Alberta Federation of Labor now these groups exist to promote an idea or support a political party without actually being officially affiliated directly with a party or any one given candidate okay so that's who and what we're talking about when we talk about third party advertisers let me show you what the NDP supporters are trying to do to us now at the rebel someone filed a complaint with Elections Alberta who then sent us this letter here in September saying someone has informed them that we at the revel may be breaking the law because we may be engaging in third party advertising and didn't register as third party advertisers in Alberta which is utterly crazy because in the same complaint letter to us the first exclusion to the law about third party advertisers is the transmission to the public of an editorial a debate a speech and interview a column a letter a commentary or news so basically what we do here at the rebel every single day and that makes perfect sense right in a free society political commentary by journalists doesn't have to be subject to government rules we aren't third party advertisers we're journalists exercising our charter rights now on the current list of third-party advertisers there are no left-wing new sites that operate on donations the same way we do sites like pro Alberta and they shouldn't be on that list as much as I'm fundamentally opposed to the content they produce they absolutely have the right to produce it unregistered by government agency and unmolested by government spending rules now I don't know who exactly filed the complaint and I may never know but it definitely was someone trying to shut me up and stop the work I'm doing to hold Rachel Notley accountable to the people of Alberta and really trying to shut me up is nothing new for the NDP who could forget when Rachel Notley used an armed sheriff to kick me out of the legislature when I just showed up to do my job and cover a press conference we already spoke to Darcy Henson he said there should be no problem coming what sorry why is that sorry what why and the NDP routinely block or overcharge us for a Freedom of Information request for documents we know exist so that we can show you the public with the NDP are doing behind closed doors now neither one of those NDP tactics have ever worked although they're positively authoritarian but I'm not scared of authoritarian NDP bullies and we aren't backing off now our lawyer is fighting back he's fired off a letter to Elections Alberta reminding them of their own rules about news and commentary so far we have had the cursory response from the government that they've received our letter but we've received no real assurance that they're going to back off but here's why this fight is so important now the NDP have just introduced a bill they plan to round through the legislature it's called bill 32 with an Orwellian official name of an act to strengthen and protect democracy in Alberta what it will do is serve to silence those who are trying to speak truth to power here in Alberta the NDP want to put a donation limit on third-party advertisers outside of an election period and put a spending cap on third-party advertisers during an election period the new law will also limit the sorts of things PACs can spend their money on the NDP kept talking about this law we knew it was coming and now here it is and that's why it matters if the NDP get their way and declare us to be third-party advertisers with the NDP are trying to do to the rebel is a preemptive strike to get a handle on us and you are supporters before they have to face the next election campaign in 2019 the NDP want to scoop us up in their new rules introduced in their new law it's so slimy and conniving to use their legislative power this way the NDP are literally reworking the elections laws to come after their own critics and imagine if the NDP were actually able to limit the amount of donations we were able to take in outside of an election period and then tell us how to spend the ones we do have could you imagine if they put a spending cap on us would we have to lay off staff and limit the kinds and volume of coverage we give to important issues probably and that's exactly what the NDP wants they don't want us around giving them to scrutiny the mainstream media just won't we have no plans to campaign for or against candidates in the Alberta election as a political entity we have never registered as a third-party campaign group in any election that we've ever covered and we have no plans to do so in the future this is just the latest attempt to silence us following in the ugly footsteps of their armed Sheriff and their bizarre letter from Alberta justice saying that we weren't journalists frankly Alberta has a long and shameful history of attacking freedom of the press the NDP is just continuing that trajectory in 1937 the Social Credit Party under Aberhart created the Alberta accurate news and information act it required each newspaper in Alberta to publish the government's rebuttal of any criticism that appeared in the newspaper within 31 days the Supreme Court of Canada struck down that bad law and the Edmonton Journal even when a special Pulitzer Prize for their role in dismantling the law will the mainstream media in Alberta fight for press freedom this time I'll be shocked and surprised if they do but I will be grateful for their support if it ever does come and while I absolutely loathe this typical NDP attack on the Free Press I do appreciate the NDP complimenting me on my work want to know what this all really means to me it means the NDP are scared to death of me it means the NDP and their activists are throwing everything and the kitchen sink at me and the rebel to shut us up in advance of the next election it's an admission by the NDP of how effective we are it's their first act in their future failed re-election campaign but just because the NDP and their extreme fear have validated my work it doesn't mean that I'm letting this stand I'm putting Rachel Notley on notice if she wants a fight over the Free Press again she's got it and she's going to lose again - we won't stand by and let her stack the Elections laws against her critics but as usual I need your help I have a petition to the elections Alberta bureaucrat who sent us that letter a man named Kevin Lee he's the director of finance for Elections Alberta you can sign my petition at not Lea's in Bulleid CA we want elections Alberta and Rachel Notley to know they aren't going to regulate us or any journalists of any kind into silence we're asking Kevin Lee to respect the constitutional freedom of the rebel to report for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read to sign our petition demanding that Kevin Lee Rachel notley's elections Alberta bureaucrat back off and respect the constitutional freedom of the press for the rebel media go to Notley is a bully dot CA you
