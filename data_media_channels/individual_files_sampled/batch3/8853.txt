THANK YOU. Jason: BEST REPORTERS SO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR GREAT PIECE YOU PUT OUT. ALSO, YESTERDAY, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMAN, THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES AND THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN TREY GOWDY ACTUALLY WENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO VIEW DOCUMENTS. THEY HAVE BEEN ASKING AND WERE UNDER SUBPOENA FOR MONTHS. BUT SOURCES TELL FOX NEWS THAT NUNES AND GOWDY WERE ONLY BRIEFED. ANOTHER MEETING IS SCHEDULED FOR THEM TO SEE IT. BUT THE BEST WAY TO GET THE INFORMATION IS TALK TO SOMEONE IN THE MEETING. TREY GOWDY AND ALSO JOHN RATCLIFFE FROM TEXAS. BOTH ARE FEDERAL PROSECUTORS AND BEEN THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND THROUGH THE PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON THIS BEAUTIFUL FRIDAY NIGHT. CHAIRMAN GOWDY, DID YOU GET A LOT OF LIP SERVICE? DID YOU GET TO READ THE DOCUMENTS? WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU? JASON, IT WAS A PRODUCTIVE MEETING YESTERDAY. I THINK EVERY QUESTION I ASKED THE BUREAU AND THE DEPARTMENT NOW UNDERSTAND THEY ARE RELEVANT, MATERIAL, THEY ARE SPECIFIC AND POINTED. THERE IS A REASON CONGRESS WANTS TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS. IT WAS A CONSTRUCTIVE I KNOW THAT IS NOT GOOD NEWS FROM THE MEDIA STANDPOINT THAT WE HAD A BORING, CONSTRUCTIVE MEETING YESTERDAY BUT THAT IS WHAT IT WAS. SO CONSTRUCTIVE WE HAVE AGREED TO MEET NEXT WEEK. YOU ASK IF WE SAW SOMETHING. I CAN LEARN WITH MY EARS AND MY EYES. I CAN GOT TO ASK QUESTIONS. WE WERE PROSECUTORS AND I KNOW THE QUESTIONS TO ASK IN AN INVESTIGATION LIKE THIS. YESTERDAY WAS ACTUALLY PRODUCTIVE. Jason: WHEN DO YOU ACTUALLY GET TO SEE THEM? WELL, LET ME SAY THIS. I WORKED IN ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. THERE IS TENSION, THERE INTENTIONAL TENSION PUT BETWEEN THE BRANCHES. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CAN'T SEE. THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CAN'T SEE. THERE ARE THINGS WE DO, JASON, AS YOU RECALL IN CONGRESS WE DON'T LET ANYBODY ELSE SEE. THAT TENSION WE HAVE GOT TO WORK THROUGH. I LEARNED INFORMATION THIS WEEK. YOU STILL WANT TO SEE THE DOCUMENTS. THEY HAVE TAKEN THE REQUEST UNDER ADVISEMENT AND REGRETTING FARTHER TAKING THIS APPROACH, MEETING EYEBALL TO EYEBALL OPPOSED TO EXCHANGING LETTERS AND SEEING WHO CAN LEAK THEM THE QUICKEST. THAT IS NOT CONSTRUCTIVE. WHAT IS CONSTRUCTIVE IS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD ACCESS THE DOCUMENT. Jason: IT'S A SHAME THAT NUNES HAD TO ISSUE A SUBPOENA AND THREATEN CONTEMPT AND THE SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN IN TREY GOWDY COMING OUT. I'M GLAD YOU ARE MAKING INCREMENTAL PROGRESS STEP BY STEP. I WANT TO GO TO JOHN RATCLIFFE AND GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON JAMES COMEY. HE IS FRESH OFF A BOOK TOUR AND HE HAS SAID A LOT OF THINGS AND WE HAVE LEARNED MORE ABOUT DIRECTOR COMEY. HAS HE MADE THE SITUATION BETTER OR WORSE FOR HIMSELF AFTER THE BOOK TOUR AND THE THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT HIS ACTIONS WHILE HE WAS THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR? GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. ONE THING THAT HAS COME OUT OF JAMES COMEY'S INTERVIEWS ON THE BOOK TOUR AND THE RELEASE OF HIS SECRET MEMOS, IT'S IRONIC TO ME THAT HE IS THE ONE THAT CREATED THE ALLEGATION OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. NOW HE IS THE SAME PERSON WHO HAS EFFECTIVEL TORPEDOED THE ABILITY TO PROVE OBSTRUCTION. I SAY THAT BECAUSE THE 15 PAGES OF THE SECRET MEMOS NEVER MENTION "OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE" A SINGLE TIME. IN FACT, ONE OF THE MEMOS DOES THE OPPOSITE. IT SAYS THAT IT IS AN ADMISSION BY THE FORMER DIRECTOR THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED HIM TO FULLY INVESTIGATE WHETHER OR NOT ANYONE, THAT COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS. THAT IS WHY TREY AND I REFER TO THE MEMO AS DEFENSE EXHIBIT "A" IN ANY CHARGES THAT WOULD BE BROUGHT AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. I THINK HE HAS ALSO HURT THE MUELLER CASE AND THE ABILITY TO PROVE THAT. YOU CAN'T BUILD A CASE AROUND A STAR WITNESS WHO HAS DAMAGED HIS OWN CREDIBILITY AND HURT HIS OWN REPUTATION AS I THINK JAMES COMEY HAS DONE OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS ON THIS BOOK TOUR. Jason: DO YOU THINK DOES HE HAVE ANY LEGAL JEOPARDY HIMSELF, DIRECTOR COMEY? I THINK THE BEST ANSWER TO THAT, JASON, WILL COME WITH THE RELEASE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT. YOU KNOW WE ALL ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN SHORTLY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL MICHAEL HOROWITZ HAS PROVEN HIMSELF TO BE A FAIR UMPIRE. SOMEONE WHO CALLS BALLS AND STRIKES FAIRLY AND WHERE APPROPRIATE MAKING CRIMINAL REFERRAL OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR. HAVING NOT HAVING SEEN THE REPORT I'D BE SURPRISED IF THEY DON'T FIND MISCONDUCT BY FORMER DIRECTOR COMEY. I THINK HE WILL FIND THAT HE VIOLATED THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT AND MADE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES OF THE F.B.I. DOCUMENTS. WHETHER THEY ARE CLASSIFIED OR NOT, THEY ARE IMPROPER LEAKS. I THINK YOU WILL FIND HE MADE DEMONSTRABLY FALSE STATEMENTS. THEY HAVE CONFLICTED WITH THE PUBLIC INTERVIEWS HE IS GIVEN. I THINK MICHAEL HOROWITZ WILL MAKE IF RECOMMENDATION. Jason: WHEN DO YOU THINK WE WILL SEE THIS? WHAT DO YOU EXPECT OUT OF THIS? DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE ANY CRIMINAL REFERRALS COMING FROM THIS? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE CRIMINAL REFERRALS. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS I TRY TO AVOID ACCUSING PEOPLE OF COMMITTING CRIMES. THAT WAS MY OLD JOB. I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO DO IT. ALL THREE OF US HAVE TREMENDOUS CONFIDENCE IN MICHAEL HOROWITZ, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR. A STRAIGHT ARROW. FACT-CENTRIC. I THINK THE REASON IT IS TAKING LONGER, JASON, THAN HE ANTICIPATED IS HE IS FINDING MORE INFORMATION. SO WHAT I WOULD TELL MY COLLEAGUES IN THE HOUSE GIVE HIM THE TIME, INDEPENDENCE AND THE RESOURCES TO DO EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO DO. I KNOW WE WANTED IT IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH AND THAT IS HUMAN NATURE TO WANT IT QUICKER BUT I WANT IT TO BE COMPLETE. I WANT IT TO BE FULSOME. I WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN WHAT HOROWITZ HAS DONE. IF HE COULD REPRESENT THAT HE IS ACCESSED EVERY DOCUMENT AND EVERY WITNESS, I MEAN HE FOUND THE PAGE-STROZK TEXT AND FOUND SOME WERE DELETED AND THROUGH HIS HELP THEY WERE RECONSTRUCTED. I'M AS IMPATIENT AS EVERYONE ELSE. I KNOW THIS. I WANT HOROWITZ TO PRESENT A FULSOME PICTURE WHEN HE COMES. IF IT MEANS WAITING ANOTHER COUPLE OF WEEKS SO BE IT. Jason: DO YOU HAVE A DATE? DO WE HAVE A DATE WHEN YOU ARE HAVING THE HEARING? WE HAVE SET ONE AND WE MOVED IT. YOU REMEMBER HOW THAT USED TO BE. WE ARE SHOOTING FOR THE FIRST WEEK OF JUNE. I WILL SAY WITH THIS CAVEAT. YOU KNOW HOROWITZ, JASON. HE IS NOT GIVING ME ANY UPDATES ON HIS INVESTIGATION, NOR SHOULD HE, NOR WOULD I ASK. LIKE TO SCHEDULE THE HEARING AND I WILL PICK A DATE AND HE WILL TELL ME WHETHER OR NOT HE THINKS HE WILL MAKE THE TARGET DATE OR NOT. I HAVE NO INSIDE INFORMATION AND I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO. Jason: REAL QUICKLY, CONGRESSMAN RATCLIFFE IN TEN SECONDS, DIRECTOR MUELLER. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT CONTINUES TO GO ON? WILL IT IMPACT THE 2018 ELECTION OR WILL HE WRAP THIS THING UP? HI HAS TO BE CAREFUL I THINK HE HAS TO BE VERY CAREFUL. MUELLER HAS TO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE THAT THEY CRITICIZED COMEY FOR TO ALLOW THE INVESTIGATION TO IMPACT AN ELECTION. WHICH THE REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS AGREED HAPPENED IN 2016. Jason: GENTLEMEN, IT'S
