-  Replace us.
You will not replace us.
You will not replace us.
- My first encounter was with
the National Socialist Movement,
which is the largest
Neo-Nazi group in America.
(eerie high-pitched notes)
After that, I started traveling with
some various Klan groups, and then I met
Matthew Heimbach, who became
the main character of my book.
(eerie high-pitched notes)
- Our movement is about
securing the existence
of our people, and a
future for white children.
All of us are engaged in this struggle.
And much like a military, there
is positions for everyone.
- Many other people, they
come from poor, rural,
and predominantly white
parts of America, Appalachia.
And they look around and
they see that their neighbors
and their friends are suffering
under opioid addiction,
that they have no jobs, and no prospects,
and they kind of extrapolate from that
then that must be what it's like
for white people all over.
They don't have the ability
to kind of lift their gaze
a little bit, because if they did,
I think they'd see that
white people on the whole,
especially white men, who this movement
is mostly consisting
of, have it pretty good.
The gatherings are a lot smaller,
and you know, that's the inherent problem
in the far right, sort of alt-right.
It's a movement, which in large part,
exists online with
anonymous Twitter avatars.
(eerie, haunting music)
With the Internet, with social media,
it becomes that much easier to
have your opinions reinforced.
And once you try to translate that into
real world action, it becomes difficult.
I was at Charlottesville where they were,
I would say around 400
people, which is by far
the largest gathering I'd ever been to.
And I'd been to dozens of these things.
Yes, there has been a mobilizing effect,
and I think people are emboldened but
even so, they're still struggling
on how to translate this
into an actionable, physical movement.
The current crop of politicians
are doing any favors,
I think they're feeding into this as well,
so it becomes this pretty toxic place
where it's easy for this kind
of rhetoric to grow even more.
- You know the side.
There was a group on this side,
you can call them the left,
you've just called them the left,
that came violently
attacking the other group.
- You know there was a rally in Boston
after Charlottesville, where I think
five or six Nationalists came out,
and a few thousand
counter-protestors came out.
There are rays of light in this thing.
Just recently, a guy, a former Hammerskin,
which is the most extreme
part of the Skinhead movement,
texted me and said he left the movement.
And that he might want to
help others leave, too.
So as awful and abhorrent
as their ideology
and politics is, some of them can change.
Some of them can turn and come back to us.
