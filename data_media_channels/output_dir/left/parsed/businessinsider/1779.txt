Hill that conversation we started in the
law library 45 years ago
it is still going strong
you know that conversation has lasted
through good times that filled us with
joy and hard times that tested us and
I've even gotten a few words in along
the way on Tuesday night I was so happy
to see that my explainer in chief is
still on the job
