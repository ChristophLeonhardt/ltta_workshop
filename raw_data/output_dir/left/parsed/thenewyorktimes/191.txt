Homing pigeons, 
like people, have leaders,
and those leaders are 
sometimes wrong.
When that happens,
what do pigeons do?
To answer that question,
researchers outfitted
some pigeons
with GPS backpacks 
like these.
The devices recorded the
lines of flight.
An analysis of all
that information
showed which pigeons
were the leaders.
For the experiment,
the researchers took
the leaders and used
artificial lighting to shift
their internal clocks.
Pigeons use the sun
to navigate,
so that messed up their
sense of direction.
When they were released,
the leaders were confused
and led their flocks astray.
But either the leaders
realized they were wrong,
and fell back in the flock,
giving someone else a
chance to lead,
or the flock 
collectively said:
“Wait a minute.
This isn’t right.”
Either way,
the pigeons figured out
what the correct 
direction was.
Sadly, these are pigeons,
and this has nothing to do
with politics.
