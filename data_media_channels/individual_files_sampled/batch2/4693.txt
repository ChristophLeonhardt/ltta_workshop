we are exactly 100 days from the midterm elections in November but at times it seems we are no closer to defending our election systems from outside meddling a bipartisan piece of legislation that aims at slapping Russia with sanctions should they interfere in any upcoming elections is gaining widespread support on Capitol Hill it's called the deter Act was introduced by Senators Chris Van Hollen and Marco Rubio and it would require the u.s. to impose major sanctions if the Director of National Intelligence declares that a foreign government meddled in any federal election Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland joins me now here in studio senator it's great to see you view an invasive on a Sunday night let's let's start by talking through this bill we've talked about it before on this show but in the wake of Helsinki it seems to be gaining some new momentum yes after the performance of President Trump with President Putin people became very concerned that the president's not going to protect the integrity of our elections and we also know from dan coates the DNI that all the warnings are flashing red that the Russians plan to interfere in our elections again midterms are less than 100 days away this bill is very straightforward it says that if after the election the Director of National Intelligence finds that the Russians have interfered in our election there will be automatic very tough sanctions so no action from the President or from Congress after that that's right I mean we're in the process of negotiations right now but that is the whole idea to deter interference do you think Mitch McConnell would be willing to let this come to the floor well Mitch McConnell has indicated this is one of the measures that he's looking at but you just raised the big question this is kind of the test over the next three weeks about whether or not the Republican leadership in the Senate and the house is serious about protecting the 2018 elections and serious about protecting our democracy we're gonna have some hearings coming up but if those hearings are not followed by real action then they'll be saying that they just don't care about protecting us from the Russians what's your sense behind the scenes as you kind of go through these negotiations I mean is McConnell more interested still interested in protecting the President or is there real concern that you know the wave is gonna be so strong that he's he's almost looking at a break well I think that after Helsinki there was a change and then the question is whether there's been enough of a change in psychology for them to actually take action because this bill is to protect us from 20:18 interference largely because the president has still refused to admit that the Russians interfered in and refused to take any real action about 2018 so we're gonna have some hearings in the Senate the Banking Committee Foreign Relations Committee and let's see where we go from there but senator Rubio and I have been gaining a lot of co-sponsors Republicans and Democrats so a lot of them I mean it's their screen right now we need to move forward on this right away I mean time is running out okay so speaking of the midterms that from a political perspective president Trump has seemingly threatened to shut down the government in September over immigration funding for his wall on the one hand if in fact Democrats do sweep in November this may be his only chance to get the money for the border wall but what impact do you think a shutdown would have the shutdown would be very bad news for the country total disruption and I think it'd be a very bad idea for Republicans going into do you think it would handle you run the the DSCC that elects Senate Democrats how do you think it would play in those races those tough races well first of all it's bad for the country and because it's bad for the country people around the that you know now all the states are gonna say what the hell is going on in Washington why is the president shutting down the government and here he's telegraphed that it's that it's his plan to do exactly that today we just learned that the families who were separated at the border that the Department Homeland Security was calling them deleted families they lost track of the kids who'd been separated from their parents and now the president is talking about essentially shutting down the government until he gets his way I should emphasize Democrats have strongly supported border security what we don't want is to waste billions of dollars of taxpayer dollars building a wall that won't work it is possible though based on how kind of the plans are structured around the appropriations process that you could only be looking at the shutdown of one or two departments per it's the Department of Homeland Security the calculations on that different as you look at it politically well we don't know how all this appropriations bills are going to shape up you're exactly right I mean there are 13 different bills whether some get passed now and some later we'll see but nobody wants to be shutting down these government agencies if the president is going to shut it down then he's gonna have to take responsibility for that I think it'd be a big mistake for the country and I think it'd be a big mistake politically for Republicans it would show that the chaos of this presidency let's talk a little bit about some of the the back-and-forth in your own party we've seen this a little bit more on the house side than the Senate side but you both as you know Alexandria of Castillo Cortez defeating joke longtime top house leader Joe Crowley she has campaigned on abolishing ice and several other of your colleagues who we all are sort of not so secretly running for president in 2020 or at least thinking about it are talking about abolishing ice this is something that the White House has seized on that other Republicans have argued is essentially a gift to them what would you say to members of your party who are running on that right now is it helpful to you as you try to get incumbent Democrats in red states re-elected well look Democrats have been very clear we're for border security the issue with ice is the way Americans probably look at apologize and say actually that's not very clear well I think I think the issue you've got with respect to the Department of Homeland Security is how they're managed by this administration and we don't need to be separating moms and dads from their kids in order to have strong border security in my own view I ice is the problem with ice is the way the president and his team have managed ice and so I don't think we should be getting into a big fight with respect to the President on ice per se but I presidents the one who's picking the fight right now with respect to shutting down the government if he doesn't get money for his wall I haven't seen him twitch seen him tweet out for a very long time that Mexico's gonna be painted that's why I mean you remember or that was what he said and left out yes so that's a fair point as we wrap up here healthcare that's an issue that you know poll after poll shows is at the top of mine for American voters it's the one-year anniversary of your you know the the attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and not not getting through the Senate do you think that your voters are hearing your message right now on health care through all of the noise that is the Trump presidency well I think voters have this on top of their minds right now so when our senators go back to their states they're not hearing a lot of what's happening in Washington all the insider stuff they're hearing about rising costs of prescription drugs they're hearing about rising gas prices and Democrats have been clear we have a plan to reduce the costs of prescription drugs you know just tweeting out against pharmaceutical companies is not a long-term solution we have a long-term solution we want to invest in modernizing our infrastructure those are the kinds of things that people around the country are focused on the president tries to distract people a lot sometimes the success successful in terms of messaging but what he cannot change is what people are thinking about and that's what our candidates are talking about on the campaign trail senator chris van hollen thanks very much for your time and thank you also for I know you participated in a fundraiser for our colleagues at the
