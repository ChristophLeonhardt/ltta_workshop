excuse me you are too young for lipstick
what are you you doing that first okay
so you want to know what we're doing
today we're doing something a little
different I'm probably not gonna be
seeing this movie for another you know
105 years but today I'm gonna be showing
you guys make it tutorial of the new
Joker from Suicide Squad so I hope you
enjoy the video it looks I look like
those people at the new at the market
they serve the fish I figured you've
never seen anything like this before but
why not the first thing we're going to
be doing about the Joker are his lips
his lips aren't actually like the old
Joker from Dark Knight it's not like
where there's like a red line there and
there he actually has it pretty cleaned
up so it looks like a woman's okay
so we're gonna be doing that right - no
hmm I'm just gonna get those like
eyeshadow things these ones I have this
kinda red dad make it whatever like
really clean on your lips you see this
dip right here he covers it
he doesn't like do a dip like that it's
not clean like that cuz you know he's
damaged I need my my trusty mirror hey
and he gonna be so perfect about it
look how beautiful I like I'm a joker
okay good guys we did it so far we've
done the lips the next thing I'm gonna
be working on is the eyes yeah I'd like
these kind of like dark circles around
his eyes it's not as much as your last
Joker words like really big black
circles they're kind of like it's kind
of like a grayish I do see that see that
you see done lookit I need my trusty
mirror smudge it with this thing so it
looks like it's kind of for you I look
like like a bowl you just want to like
tap it because then you're gonna like
smudge it with this after do I look okay
okay done the next thing that you're
gonna do is you're gonna paint your face
what so I'm gonna get my little smudger
that it's really doing some white face
paint that's right here
white cream makeup like they say
and this is not actually like that white
it's because his face is like really
pale I think we're going to make these
lips look a little bit dark okay now
that I've darkened my lips up so that I
don't look like The Dark Knight Joker
and I look a little like this one I'm
gonna do the landing bullet on his eye
get me rate damaged
