Donald Trump has delivered his first State of the Union address on Capitol Hill in his speech he praised the accomplishments of his first year as president of the United States together we are building a safe strong and proud America we want every citizen to be proud and our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free thank you and God bless america good night it's across live now to our Washington correspondent bursts americon it's just after midnight where you are now it's been a long night for you following the State of the Union address some of the highlights Samara well he started off explaining what's changed since last year and all of the policies he followed through on and then went on to say that his administration has been making America great for all Americans but this statement turned out to be quite decisive a divisive reactions range from standing ovations to some booing from the audience we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission to make America great again for all Americans but moving on to policy it was a fairly lengthy speech but he managed to go into both domestic and foreign policy but of course mostly domestic policy bragging about his trickle-down economic policies as celebrating police and veterans and exporting unclean energy to the world he also brought up infrastructure proposing 1.5 trillion dollars to improve infrastructure but he focused quite heavily on immigration announcing an immigration reform plan that will ensure a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants and fund his border wall and arguably one of the most important announcements of the night keeping guantanamo bay open beyond that Trump took credit for eliminating Isis but truthfully that credit should go to the Syrian army the Iraqi army Hezbollah Kurdish forces and of course Russia and Iran but then he seemed to have hinted at continued military presence in the region saying that quote we will continue our fight until Isis is defeated but what does that mean exactly who knows Trump also boasted about recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and then berated the quote dozens of countries that voted voted against the US but it wasn't dozens it was actually a hundred and twenty-eight countries I don't know if that qualifies as dozens or not but then he went on about Iran he reiterated support for Iranian protesters who quote rose up against their corrupt dictatorship and then bragged about increasing sanctions on the quote communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela he ended with North Korea calling it the worst of all cruel dictatorships warning that their pursuit of nuclear weapons could soon for in our homeland even though DPRK DPRK has never attacked another country before North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position well Russia and China have been trying to reduce tensions between the u.s. and North Korea and they even called on the u.s. to not provoke North Korea anymore but somehow they were listed as threats and Trump's speech around the world we face rogue regimes terrorist groups and rivals like China and Russia that challenged our interests our economy and our values in confronting these horrible dangers we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense well representative Kennedy will be responding from the Democratic side and senator Bernie Sanders will be live-streaming his response but I'm definitely interested to hear the Democratic Party's response to see if they criticize his foreign policy at all now I was watching some mainstream media responses and and the only thing foreign policy-wise they had to criticize or Guantanamo Bay and and being too soft on Russia so we'll just have to wait and see what their responses are about East America and live in Washington thank you all right live now to at Neil W McCabe national political reporter at big league politics O'Neill thanks for coming on I know it's after midnight where you are so it's a late night for you but you are watching the State of the Union your overall thoughts are anything that surprised you well I thought the speech was absolutely fantastic I thought the president was as Reagan s as I've ever heard him and I thought one thing that was very interesting because I was in the room last year for his first address to Congress and it was very awkward many of the Republicans weren't even sure people along there in a way Trump it said he had a since that he was in enemy territory a year ago this year a completely United Republican Party it was absolutely an amazing speech and I think people who who listen to the response all of the interruptions from the applause he really really delivered a great speech time Neil King is it too soon to draw any comparisons between trumps state of the union and the two from former President Barack Obama well the thing about Barack Obama is he was a very clinical speaker he was very dry very intellectual and he had a lot of trouble connecting with people he he gets a lot of credit for his soaring rhetoric but by year seven and eight of his administration people really got tired of it you factors I spent 20 minutes after Barack Obama's last State of the Union address with a Massachusetts congressman congressman McGovern a Democrat and for about 20 minutes we talked about the lost opportunities of Barack Obama and certainly it was surprising to me to hear a Democratic congressman look forward to his moving on because he really as I said he had trouble connecting with people and getting things done and so to listen to his rhetoric every year at a State of the Union address it really became awkward and painful because he was unable to move his agenda through Congress itself all right and Trump did claim though that Russia challenges America's interests and values which of these very quickly if you don't mind was he referring to well I think the real challenge right now is to settle immigration and to really seek that big compromise but also he called for a very bold infrastructure program about 1.5 trillion dollars he antes also he also expressed an openness of working with Democrats he said he had an open hand to work with Democrats wealthier to solve the problem of poverty in America and it's really up to the Democrats now to take them up on that neil w mccabe national political reporter at big league politics thanks so much for your time it's been a late one for you good night
