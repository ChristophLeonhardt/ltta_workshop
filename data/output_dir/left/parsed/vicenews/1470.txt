America incarcerates more people
than any other country on Earth.
We're home to less than 5%
of the world's population,
but 25% of the world's inmates.
Today there are 2.2 million
people behind bars in America.
Now that's a 700% increase
since 1970.
We lock up hundreds of thousands
of people for nonviolent offenses,
and as a result, our prison system
is disastrously overcrowded,
and we spend about $80 billion a
year just to keep it that way.
Meanwhile, it's minority communities
that are getting hit hardest.
So we're here in Washington
to find out for ourselves
just how broken the system is.
Now, perhaps the best person 
 to answer this question is
former Attorney General 
 Eric Holder.
So we sat down to talk 
 with this former judge
and federal prosecutor, 
 who from 2009 until last year,
oversaw the entire Justice
Department of the United States.
So we have a problem with
over-incarceration in this country.
You have whole communities,
you know,
that either are locked up or
know someone that's locked up
or have been affected
by being locked up.
Is the American criminal
justice system today broken?
Well, people
in various communities,
and especially communities
of color, poor communities,
see a criminal justice system
that they perceive to be unfair,
and, in fact is,
in many ways, unfair.

And they see 
 individual instances
of people they know 
 being treated too harshly.
Serving, you know, 
 too much time in jail...
being held in jail,

resentment over time...

Get out of the car! Get out!

Holder:  Police-civilian interaction
that results in a death,

Holder:  A determination made
that the way to fund government

 they wrote enough tickets.

Police officers themselves 
 are beginning to speak up.
Sergeant Michael Wood is
a decorated 11-year veteran
of the Baltimore Police 
 Department.
When I was a sergeant,
we were routinely
one of the best
squads in the city.
But why were we 
 the best squad in the city?
We were the best squad because
we had the most arrests,
and I am feeding those stats
with nothing but almost
exclusively those black males
in the 16-to-24- 
 year-old range,
and it's not necessarily because they're
the ones committing the crimes.
Those are the ones we're 
 supposed to be focusing on
by our entire mantra of what
is effective criminal justice.
(people shouting)

Wood:  When we had 
 the uprising,
it's like a straw 
 on the camel's back
that makes people finally say,
"Enough is enough."
(shouts)
Wood:  Whites and
blacks have been known
to carry narcotics 
 at the exact same rate.
So, if we went around
riling through pockets
whenever we wanted
in a white neighborhood,
I'm sure we'd find a lot of
things, but we don't do that.
We only do that 
 in these neighborhoods.
Why y'all hitting me for?
In a middle-to upper-class white neighborhood,
if I were to go around
and I were to lock up
the judge's 16-year-old child
for possession of marijuana,
you can rest assured that I'm gonna get
a phone call that something is wrong,
and they're gonna have
high-powered lawyers
that are gonna come
after the department
and make sure that
this thing gets buried.
But if I do that to somebody
in a low-income neighborhood,
especially if they're black, 
 then they just get fed
into the system where they get public
defenders that don't have any time,
they get plea-bargained out,

obligated to talk to my son
probably I guess
three years or so ago.
And he's tired of me
talking to him about it now.
Mmm.
But I want to ingrain in him
this notion of how
you conduct yourself.
Smith:  And that's not 
 an unfounded fear.
As nearly 75% of those 
 who end up in federal prison
for drug offenses are 
 either black or Hispanic.
But getting arrested is 
 just the first step,
because once 
 they enter the system,
they face huge prison sentences,
as mandated by Congress.
These mandatory minimum
sentences in the federal system
resulted in disparities
that were economic based,
racially based, and led
to the incarceration--
the mass incarceration problem,
that we are
dealing with even now.
Smith:  So we asked 
 Federal Judge John Gleeson,
a former prosecutor famous for
taking down mobster John Gotti,
how mandatory minimums have 
 driven this massive growth
in America's prison population.
You see all of these-- these people
coming in, and you, by law...
Yes.
...have to put them away for a long time.
Yes.
What happens because of that?
Injustice happens
because of that.
You look at the federal
drug-trafficking defendants--
7% of them are either
a manager or a kingpin,
93% are low-level folks.
But the severity
that Congress intended
just for that top 7% is being
spread across the entire docket.
If you're the judge who's 
 imposing that sentence,
you feel pretty bad about it,
'cause your job is to do justice.
One of the reasons why we wanted
to talk to you was because
we want to get to know
how all of this began,
how we got
to where we are today.
So we're in, you know,
June 19th of 1986.
Crack was new. 
 Here in New York,
the murder rate was 
 four times what it is now.
Mm-hmm. 
 But there's an event that happens.

basketball player, Lenny Bias.

 #2 by the Celtics.
They have a party on campus 
 in College Park.
He dies of an overdose.
♪ ♪
I can't tell you how important that event is...
Mm-hmm.
...because Congress responds 
 by passing a law that
a drug trafficking offense 
 in federal court
is going to be mandatory 
 minimum 10 years,
maximum life.
But Congress made a mistake.
They triggered
those mandatory minimums
by drug quantity and drug type.
A hundred grams 
 of powdered cocaine
were treated the same
as one gram of crack.
Mm-hmm. That seems
to be a little bit...
not well thought out.
Well, Congress blew it.
You know, let's face it.
Crack was an inner-city, 
 poor neighborhood drug,
so there was 
 a racially-disparate impact
of these crack prosecutions.
We need to come
to grips with the fact
that we have an overly punitive
and racially
discriminatory system.
How do we change?
Change comes slowly.
Smith:  Now change 
 has come slowly,
because for more than 30 years,
our system has 
 been entirely focused
on the so-called 
 war on drugs.
We're getting tough on drugs
and we mean business.

Hey, down!
George H.W. Bush:  If you sell
drugs, you will be caught,
and when you're caught,
you will be prosecuted,
and once you're convicted,
you will do time.
To go back, this was all
based on the war on drugs.
Was the war on drugs successful?
Politicians got involved
in trying to decide
criminal justice policy,
statutes were passed,
policies were put in place...

The war on drugs, 
 the crack epidemic--
it became, I think,

We need more prisons,

more prosecutors.
Incarceration became
an easy, simple, uh,
recipe in the minds
of a lot of folks.
Newscaster:
 With Election Day approaching
and polls showing 
 that drug abuse
is the public's 
 number one concern,
today's voting became a contest
to determine 
 who could be toughest
on drug traffickers.
Nobody ever lost an election
'cause they were
too tough on crime.
Sure.
And so, nobody stepped back and asked,
"Is it really appropriate for...
"somebody who's engaged in a serious
but nonviolent drug offense
"to get more time
than a rapist?"
What's been interesting is
that violent crime rates
have consistently declined
and the costs of incarceration
obviously have skyrocketed.
The stats are staggering.
One in 17 white men will go
to prison in their lifetime,
one in three black men.
Is the criminal justice system
in America racist?
I think the criminal justice
system interacts with...
broader patterns of society
in a way that results
in... injustice
and unfairness.
The system,
every study has shown,
is biased somewhere,
institutionally,
in such a way where
an African-American youth
is more likely to be
suspended from school
than a white youth for engaging
in the same disruptive behavior,
more likely to be arrested,
more likely to be charged,
more likely to be
prosecuted aggressively,
more likely to get
a stiffer sentence.
The system tilts
in a direction that is unjust,
and particularly when you think
about nonviolent drug offenses.
This is an area where
the statistics are so skewed,
you have to question, uh,
whether we have become numb
to the costs that it has
on these communities,
whether we think
it's somehow normal
for black youth or Latino youth
to be going through
the system in this way.
It's not normal, and it has to
be addressed from soup to nuts
in order for us to get
some better outcomes.
You've done drugs...

you're the first president
to feel empathy

Well, I'd like to think other
presidents feel the same way,
but I can tell you
I feel it... acutely.
When I moved to Chicago 
 and I started doing
community organizing 
 in low-income neighborhoods,
one of the most 
 powerful thoughts that I had
was driving
by street corners, uh,
with kids who at that stage--
I was in my early 20s--
really weren't that
far off from where I was,
and knowing that
the mistakes they made
would land them,
potentially, in prison...
in ways that just were not true
for me, growing up in Hawaii.
The notion that you or I...
couldn't have easily
been drawn into that,
that somehow
we wouldn't have fallen prey
to the temptations
of the streets--
that doesn't feel right to me.
That doesn't feel true.
Smith:  The president didn't just want
to talk about the problem, though.
He wanted to speak 
 directly to the people
who were doing time 
 as a result of it.
So he asked to sit down

One of my concerns
has been how...
we're dealing with
nonviolent drug offenses--
the levels of incarceration
have gone way up,
the length of sentences
increased significantly--
whether the sentencing
and the price
that not only
individuals are paying,
but their families for the mistakes
they make, are proportional,
and whether we need
to make some changes.
And I'm also interested
in figuring out,
as people get released,
whether they've got the tools
they need to be able to stay
on the straight and narrow
or whether the temptation
is to go back on the streets
and then end up back here.

When you think
about your sentences, um,
I know this is something Shane

how many of you pled out?
Basically everybody, yeah.
Smith:  Now the vast majority 
 of federal drug cases
result in plea bargain deals,
which are a way to avoid 
 the huge sentences
that the system might 
 impose if the defendant
actually took his case 
 to trial and lost.
Now in a plea deal, the
defendant says he's guilty
in exchange 
 for a reduced sentence,
no matter how weak the case 
 against him might be.
Didn't they charge you
for a crime
that you were supposed to have
committed while you were in prison?
Yes. I kind of feel that
I probably could've beat
the charge,
but due to my
criminal background,
I was more scared
of the time I was gonna get.
And you were telling me
about the same thing,
that you pled down for the...
Tyrone: I pled down
to 15 years. I was--
My lawyer told me I would get
life if I take it to trial.
Smith:  And Judge Gleeson
explained to us
how these mandatory 
 minimum sentences
have driven plea rates 
 higher and higher.
One way in which prosecutors use
the powers that Congress gave 'em
is to say to someone, "The way
you're going to get out from under
"an unjust mandatory sentence
is you plead guilty."
The federal criminal trial
is kind of disappearing.
Before we had this regime, the
guilty plea rate used to be 80%.
We now have a federal guilty
plea rate of over 97%.
Fewer of 3%
of the cases go to trial.
Prosecutors are determining
how much time
they're gonna get before it--
it goes to trial.
You're right.
Sometimes they use their power
to compel an outcome
that's unjust.
Smith:  This can happen even if the defendant
isn't actually caught dealing drugs.
Through what's called 
 a conspiracy charge,
he can be convicted 
 for merely agreeing
to commit a crime 
 with another person.
David Shaw pled guilty to
conspiracy to distribute crack.
Now he contends that he
was charged on the basis
of allegations from people 
 he didn't even know,
on a date when he says he was already
incarcerated for a separate offense.
I was indicted
on a 280 gram conspiracy
to distribute a controlled
substance, crack cocaine.
And they got three people that's
willing to testify against you,
that's saying that you done deal with
them prior in the past of selling drugs.
So there were federal inmates...
Yes.
...who basically said that you
had been with them and...
They said I sold them
a certain amount of drugs--
sold so many times on this day.
What's weird about that, too, at the
time they said I was selling them drugs,
I was incarcerated at that time that
they said I was selling them drugs.
If you're incarcerated when you're
supposed to be selling drugs,
why would you plead out?
That doesn't seem to make any sense at all.
The reason why I pleaded out
is because it's hard to beat.
I done seen plenty of people
that took it to trial
and end up
with a whole lot of time.
When you go to court you know, and
they bring these people back,

I had people in my cases

Smith:  However, 
 under conspiracy laws,
that's actually allowed, because
defendants can be found responsible

The prison population of the United
States was flat most of the 20th century.
The last 50 years
was this era shaped
by a commitment to mass incarceration
and excessive punishment.
The prison population goes 
 from 300,000 to 2.3 million,
and this has really redefined
the kind of country we are,
the kind of place we inhabit.
I think the greatest tragedy of
the era of mass incarceration
has been its impact
on people of color.
The Bureau of Justice reported
at the beginning of the century
that it expects one in three black
male babies born in this country
to end up in jail or prison at
some point during their lifetimes.
That's a pretty shocking number.
The bottom line is
that if you are poor,
and particularly if you're
a person of color,
you're presumed guilty.
There is a presumption of guilt
that follows you 
 into the courtroom.
Once you're arrested, 
 that's what people think.
And it then increases your
burden to prove your innocence,
to prove that you shouldn't receive
this kind of extreme sentence.
It has created despair 
 in communities of color.

What's holding it up?
So, you know
I'm new in the Senate...
Right.
...and when I was mayor of the city,
when we would see
things like, you know,
we wanted to build
this park right here...
that kids are playing in. And we built a park.
Right. Right.
And the challenge with the federal
legislature is it moves a lot slower.
We need a far more
comprehensive focus,
and we need to move
with a sense of urgency.
And we have to think
about how many guys,
who are coming back from prison,
come back with no hope,
believe that there's
no opportunities.
I think it was James Baldwin who said,
"There's nothing more dangerous
"than a man that believes
he has no hope."
And we see this-- almost two-thirds
of the people coming out
end up going right
back down that slope.
Smith:  One business 
 owner we met
told us how hard it's been 
 for him to stay clear
of the legal system, 
 even after serving his time.
Booker: So, most of
the fellas you know
got involved in really
low-level stuff, right?
And they get
that criminal conviction,
and then it's a trap, right?
How hard is it to get out?
What are you talking about?
We're still trying to get out, man.
I still got ties to the system.
I'm still paying.
For any crime you do,
you're gonna pay a stipend.
You know what I'm saying?
You come out of jail,
you paid your debt,
but you really--
you haven't pay your debt,
'cause you got thousands
of dollars worth of fines.
- Exactly. - What happens if you don't
pay the fines down?
We get relocked up.
Smith:
 Now these fees may vary,
but almost every state 
 requires offenders
to pay for part 
 of the legal process,
like room and board 
 or probation costs.
Some states even make you pay
for your public defender.
Randell was living 
 in Philadelphia
when he was picked up 
 for dealing drugs.
And after serving his time, 
 he couldn't find a job
and fell badly behind 
 on his fees.
I moved back to Philadelphia.
It's like hard getting jobs
and stuff down there,
so I just went back
to what I was doing.
I was selling drugs,
and I got put up.
You go to see your
parole officer
and you don't have money,
they will hold you.
Job or no job, and if you don't
pay, you come back to jail.
Yeah.
I know one thing, I found myself selling drugs
to pay back Pennsylvania.
Damn! Yeah, that's-- that's bad.
So my original max
of three and a half to seven
turned into, like,
seven and a half to 15.
(laughs) Yeah, just...
keep you on parole forever.
You'll never get off.
McCall was asking about you last weekend.
Again?
Yes. I guess
it's kind of hard for them
to get a grasp
of you being away.
Man. Plus, they don't
think I'm in jail.
No, 'cause he believes
that you're at work.
Ahh. Yeah.
Yeah.
It's sad.
Yeah.
Smith:  Many offenders can end up
thousands of dollars in debt,
making it nearly impossible
for those who can't find work
to pay what the state 
 says that they owe.
And on top of all that, 
 in many states,
felons can't apply 
 for food stamps,
public housing, 
 or education loans--
effectively stripping them 
 of the support
that they need 
 to rebuild their lives.
And how long were you in prison?
Seven.
Seven.
It took me four years to get a job.
Four years.
Four years. I had little jobs.
I had one job making $5 an hour,
then I got a raise to $5.25.
I sold soap, pencils,
toothpaste, T-shirts, socks--
anything I could sell, so I wouldn't go back.
Right.
And my kids would laugh at me.
"Daddy, you used to
take money. Now you..."
So I showed 'em my check stubs.
They just rolling
on the floor laughing.
"Daddy, you work for this?
Come on, you can't even take care of..."
I said, "Just be patient.
I'm gonna get y'all.
"I'm going-- I'm coming,
I'm gonna get you."

Booker: I come back
to Newark, New Jersey,
when I come back
from the Senate,
and I see this sense
of urgency every single day.
We have a perspective now
with our country
is that we're gonna take
a guy, send him to prison,
and even when he's coming out,
we're gonna continue to crush you,
because we're gonna
make sure you keep
paying for that by denying
you job opportunities,
by denying you
business licenses,
by denying you food stamps
if you're hungry,
by denying you housing
if you have no shelter.
When you stop at an entrepreneur
who's still paying fines and fees
even though he's paid his debt...
Right.
...the urgency for me is seeing that we're
dealing with the generational consequences
of being the country that has
the ignominious distinction
on the planet Earth for
incarcerating its own people.
We are the incarceration champions
on the planet Earth right now,
and we don't understand that that hurts
not just neighborhoods like this,
but it hurts all Americans.
We're all paying for this.
So many people are victims of this
system as well as their children.

You've said-- a lot of other
people have said as well--
the war on drugs
has been a failure,
the criminal justice system
has problems.
That's bi-partisan now.
Both sides of the aisle are saying,
"Yes, we realize
there's problems."
This has become a big issue for you.
Can it be fixed?
So, there's a whole bunch of front-end
investments that we can make.
If we focus on intervening
with young people early,
if we focus even in the schools
and making sure that black boys
and Latino boys aren't 
 suspended at higher rates,
if we're really investing 
 in their education,
and they're reading at a third-grade
level when they're in third grade,
then we know
that they're less likely
to get into the criminal justice
system in the first place.
If we invest in education 
 programs in prisons--
You heard those guys talking about how
much of a difference it made for them.
Substance abuse programs
and education programs...
Vocational programs.
...vocational programs,
so that we recognize-- 
 we gotta prepare them
for a better way
when they get of here
'cause they're gonna get-- most of them
are going to get out of here eventually.

We can lose sight
of how intoxicated
we've become as a culture
with imprisonment 
 as a response to crime.
We need to remind ourselves
that there are real people,
and real families, 
 and real communities
that have been 
 altered dramatically.
Stevenson:  When you think about throwing
everybody in jails and prisons,
it's a really hopeless way 
 to govern our society.
It's completely inconsistent 
 with a democracy
that prides itself
on freedom and equality.
Lots of people are having 
 their lives destroyed
not because they have to, 
 but because we have chosen
to ignore a basic commitment
to fairness, 
 justice, and equality.
And that's
the challenge of America,
for me, in the 21st century.
Nothing's easy.
Most people aren't interacting
with the criminal justice
system and they don't see
the impact that it's having
on their communities.
And part of our job is 
 just to shine a spotlight.
I think there's enough empathy
among people of goodwill
across the political spectrum that
we may be able to pull this off.
