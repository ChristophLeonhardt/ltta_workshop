the candidates for the Lewis shimmies by-election have been announced on it's not a simple race there's 14 candidates seriously 14 candidates have been announced for the lewisham piece by election to replace heidi alexander and pretty much every party you can think of is standing the world rumors I heard rumors that lourd bucket head was going to stand if you've never heard of him he's a candidate who stands on stage as a candidate wearing a black cape with a bucket on his head he's a legend unfortunately it turns out he's not standing but I thought I would go through today the full list the full 14 candidates and see what we're dealing with here just for a bit of perspective obviously Labour's going to win within the next couple of days the postal votes go out which means in the next couple of days let the Labour Party will win the lowest shimmies fire action that's going to be held on the 14th of June next month Labor's gonna win but let's take a look at the candidates so starting off with for the Green Party we've got Rosamund I do kiss Deborah she is a clean air campaigner at the head of a sixth form appears to be a new candidate I've looked in these sort of past elections in though she reached can't see her previously but last time around the Greens got 803 votes 1.7 percent of the votes I can't really see much of a surge here the late the Labour Party has such a massive majority which means most of the people from the left go to labour I don't see any reason why people are going to be turning to a clean air campaigner anytime soon the second the most likely second results is going to be the Tories and Ross Archer is the candidate for the Tory Party now the first time I saw Ross online was when I saw pictures of his terrible terrible election literature on Twitter so I mean look at this knocking on doors in Lee for Ross Archer look at this picture why is that font I called to see you today and hear your views Ross Archer it looks like an advert for a crap like car - there's something like what is that and also it's it's clearly just been photocopied I mean you'd expect a bit back from the Conservative Party I mean really you call that election material my god it's comical but it's a real list the Tories don't even need to go out and do anything because they're going to come second almost certainly I mean this is a constituency that voted about 40% breaks it so that way it's gonna go somewhere it's probably not gonna go to the Labour Party I very much doubt it's gonna go back to you Kip so the Tories have got second in the bag here also as well by the way with the literature there's one thing that really bugs me as a writer and it's when election literature is written in the present tense I don't I don't know if this is just me but so for instance here selected on Thursday out campaigning for him on a sunny Saturday and there's a picture here and it's got Ross Archer and then it says listening to lewisham listening to Lou it does it not just come across as really unnatural and patronizing and earth it's just politician talk it's it's the equivalent of when a politician walks into a room into a new venue that's been opened in their constituency and they walk in with their hands like this going why do politicians immediately turn into robots the minute they're elected and why is there election literature always so Nath is crap come on excite us with something Jesus there's also an independent candidate called Charles Kerry now there's not even a single mention on Twitter of Charles Kerry of it doesn't seem to be any visible campaign now what I would say is never underestimate a good independent independents have caught me out before if you get someone who's well-known and popular locally they can do pretty well but I've done a lot of googling and I cannot see anything about this Charles Carrey so who knows could be a good candidate could be a crackpot then there's little Labour candidate the other candidate that's will soon be crowned the next MP for Lois um east and it's Janet dabby sorry might be being culturally insensitive there is it Janet Davey she won the all woman all ba and a shortlist Sakina shake and Claudia Webb lost but Debbie is no moderate in February she was seen taking part in a panel discussion was she killed beg which was reported on by Guido Fawkes she killed bags an email from Louis iam Islamic Center which has connections to the Lee Rigby killers and beg also lost a live of action cased to the BBC when the BBC said that he'd encouraged religious violence because it turned out he had so this dabby woman is pretty concerning I mean what to expect from labour though she wants to stay in the single market as well so the 60% that voted against sorry the 60% them voted remain I mean of course they're gonna go labour she's your candidate she's gonna win Democrats and veterans are standing somebody Massimo diamond bro who lives in Lucien I'm not convinced by the Democrats and veterans I'm really not I don't think they've got an inspiring leader the names a bit crap Democrats people don't immediately associate with that veterans gives it the impression that it's a one-issue party it's not really inspiring name and their candidate the candidates campaign has raised 370 quid as of the filming of this video so I don't think we're going to be impressed here the libertarian party's standing the Libertarian Party calls themselves a classically liberal mini kist party found it was founded in 2008 they've not done much in the last 10 years I've looked at all the elections they've covered in seven seats they've stood for they've never got more than not 0.4% so and I don't want to sound mean but their official YouTube interview with their candidate is about 100 views in 5 days so again not really much competition here there's also the radical parties anyone heard of the radical party before I had a Google and it says the party was born out of discussions after the May 25th election involving people from different political backgrounds which threatened by leaders who fail to speak up clearly against short-sighted and self-destructive nationalism and there's some left-wing party it's pointless being a left-wing party in Lewisham they're going to vote labour so radical party probably not going to do very well young people's party Thomas Hall the young people's party you'd think it'd be this party that campaigns specifically about having a university and stuff like that but you look at the website and their main policy is collecting taxes based on the value of land rather than earnings what I don't know who's gonna vote for that and they've never achieved more than 0.2% of the vote in any of the constituencies they study so again no real competition then we've got the monster raving loony party so we don't have a little bucket head but we do have the loonies if you don't know what the monster raving loony party are they're basically joke candidates is a joke party I mean so legitimate political party but they're a joke they've got policies like besides leap years there needs to be hop skip and jump years I vaguely remember a painted purple policy from years ago which was to paint every seven houses purple because they think it'll lift the national mood and make people happier another great policy they've got is we will reduce the national debt by selling the castles back to the French buy a dismantled amazing if I can manage to get to the count for this then hopefully I will meet housing Lord hope yes you keep standing David Curtin who's the GLA member for you Kip he's not previously been a candidate in Lewis uni so that probably will work against him interestingly Amory waters was the you Kip candidate in 2015 and came third but in 2017 you Kipp came fifth with 1.7 percent of the votes so you kept got an uphill battle here especially with the recent troubles you kept kind of collapsing Christian People's Alliance Maureen Martin a regular candidate for lewisham East she stands there a lot Maureen stood in 2017 she came last with naught point 5 percent of the vote and that vote went down from 2015 by noir point 2 percent there's a big black African Christian president in the constituency that she may well appeal to but no real contender there women's equality party is standing interestingly I don't know if it's still the case but this was at least connected to Sandi Toksvig from Qi which upsets me because I like sandy talks very well the I mean it's just a mad feminist party I mean women's equality party what what rights exactly are they fighting for this woman man do Reid who's from Lewisham which is an instantly a good thing as a candidate but she's the founder of the cup effect which is a woman's menstrual health nongovernmental organization would you vote for her and wouldn't Liberal Democrats have got Lucy salic who's the director of humanitarian startup and refugee charity go figure it's a remain constituency to the Liberal Democrats could technically do well but as I say most left-wing remain voters are going to go for Janet Gabby because was she's almost certainly the winner and she's Pro remain she and she wants to keep us in the single market so I actually think it's possible here that the Liberal Democrats will go down I think I'll say that I think I'll say the Liberal Democrats share vote sure percentage-wise I think will go down and then finally the for Britain movement for Britain and Marie waters she was the candidate as I say in 2015 came third with three thousand eight hundred and eighty six votes and nine point one percent of the vote which is pretty amazing for London is pretty amazing for a remain constituency this was pre referendum now if people remember Anne Marie then she could do well if you know she she got quite a wide sort of spectrum of voters going for her whether that was because she was a good candidate or you Kip who knows Lib Dems got two thousand four hundred and fifty five votes in 2015 and then that was reduced to two thousand and eighty six in 2017 so if Anne Marie can inspire those voters that supported her in 2015 to come back and support her you mean there's not out the realm of possibility people left you keep they're obviously willing to look somewhere else they may well look for her and then actually Amory could come third and beat the Lib Dems so I've come up with a list of my predictions for the lower shimmies by-election and you might think am i bit mad but I'm willing to go out on a limb here and say that I think obviously Labour will win obviously the Conservatives will come second but then I think third I think Ann Marie might do it I think for Britain might welcome third she's done it before in 2015 she could do it again it just depends how well she mobilizes her campaigners and how much time she's able to spend in the constituency and if she can bring back the voters from 2015 I think she could do it the Liberal Democrats I think will come forth obviously most of the left-wing remain boats gonna go to labour you Kip maybe fifth maybe even six but I'll say from a four argument here you get fifth Greens six then I think it will be the women's equality party then the Christians then Democrats and veterans young people independent the independent could be anywhere but I've just throwing him in there because I really don't know if he's a good candidate or not libertarian monster raving loony party and then I think the radical party will come last because I don't see any real I don't know I just don't see a campaign there I don't see anyone willing to support a small left-wing party I think the probability come last so there we are it's not long now it's literally just a few weeks until the by-election this could be really interesting but I think the battle here is between you Kipp and for Britain for Britain's got a big big task on its hands here to beat you Kip I and if they mobilize well they could do it they could do it I said the other day on Twitter that I think you keeps in a death spiral now and I don't say that to be mean I don't say that to offend any of my you Kipp voting or supporting viewers I I saw the death spiral of the BNP I'm seeing a death spiral of you Kipp and it's got nothing to do with the the content of their policies that this death spiral happened it's as the minute a party has seen as dead to the voters they'll never return to it because they don't believe that the party could do well and I think you gives in that death spiral now so yeah interesting by-election you kids got a lot to make up for I don't think they'll be able to do it but one thing is for sure and that's Janet Dobby is the next MP volition East if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to download our app on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store and like and subscribe you
