let's dive headfirst right into these awesome questions Roger says in the long haul can Steve Jobs compete against millions of innovators around the world who are hungry after apple's obscene profit awesome question Roger I don't think in the long long haul Steve Jobs candies one man there's millions coming after him but in the short term 5-10 years I think they'll be fine they've got crazy amounts of cash and they're very inventive Google is a better question I think are a better company to look at in this regard because they have one really great product and they're sort of feeling around looking for that second thing and if they'll find it they'll be in great shape but a lot of people are coming after them I think next question from Jeremy hua handsets will evolve into your go everywhere do everything device Microsoft has nothing in that arena and the best it could do in mp3 players has been an impaired embarrassing failure zune coming on the heels of its previous failure played for sure has anyone actually ever seen a zune in the wild anyone I don't think so daniel m clark s months and months of speculation by experts about a tablet that doesn't exist and hasn't been even hinted at by Apple much less confirmed it's retarded do you guys really have nothing better to do than argue the merits and price points of an imaginary device Daniel you must be new here obviously we don't have anything better to do but this is going to be a product that seems you know a lot of speculation that's coming out it's going to be a big deal for Apple and it's going to be a big deal just not just for Apple you talk about publishers or trying to use it to position themselves for the future it's um it's a big product and I think that we want to be ready for it if it does come out and it turns out our readers really enjoy reading about it final question from lily white with the juju have been more impressive if TechCrunch were still involved honestly I don't see how it would have been more impressive from all the reports that Arrington is put on TechCrunch he said basically they were involved with up until the last minute so what we saw appears to be what they were testing and working on and TechCrunch isn't you know Michael Arrington isn't a coder Engineer designer he could have put a great deal of input into it and he probably did but I don't see what having him pull out at basically you know a month before it was shown to the public would have helped would it have been better for the juju that have TechCrunch on board and not have animosity I think so you have a really huge community around TechCrunch and people who like Michael Arrington and we're sort of angry at the juju for coming out in the way it's been portrayed so i think that the design and the product itself want to benefit about marketing certainly would have well thanks for hanging out guys
