THANK YOU!

36
00:01:08,157 --> 00:01:09,757
MARIA: LET'S TALK FIRST ENTRCE.

37
00:01:09,758 --> 00:01:11,092
OBVIOUSLY A BIG DEAL THAT

38
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:11,993
CANADA GOT THIS DONE AND THE

39
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:12,527
NEW USNCA IN PLACE.

40
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:13,494
WHEN YOU EXPECT THE AMERICA

41
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:14,429
PEOPLE TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF

42
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,433
THIS NEW TRADE DEAL?

43
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:20,168
>> WELL, LOOK, IT HAS TO GO

44
00:01:20,169 --> 00:01:21,936
THROUGH SOME PAPERWORK AND A

45
00:01:21,937 --> 00:01:22,236
VOTE.

46
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:25,039
AND CONGRESS.

47
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,808
BUT, THE KEY POINT HERE, IS

48
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:27,542
THAT THIS NEW DEAL OPENS UP A

49
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:31,979
LOT OF MARKETS FOR AMERICAN

50
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,381
FARMERS, A BIG HELP TO AMERICAN

51
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:33,948
WORKERS, MAIN STREET,

52
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:34,482
BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS.

53
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:39,954
MUCH BETTER CONDITIONS.

54
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:46,294
MUCH BETTER RESOLUTIONS, IT

55
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:47,095
OPENS UP FINANCIAL SERVICES,

56
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:47,795
DIGITAL SERVICES.

57
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:48,529
I THINK IT IS A VERY GOOD DEAL

58
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,098
AND I THINK NOW OF THE SUPPLY

59
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:50,998
CHAINS IN NORTH AMERICA ARE

60
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:51,699
GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK OUT

61
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:51,999
WELL.

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,534
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WANTS TO

63
00:01:53,535 --> 00:01:57,171
HELP THE NEGOTIATE BETTER DEALS

64
00:01:57,172 --> 00:01:57,972
.

65
00:01:57,973 --> 00:01:58,740
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TEMPLATE

66
00:01:58,741 --> 00:01:59,941
FOR THAT.

67
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:00,641
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT IT

68
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:03,077
SAYS, USNCA.

69
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:04,011
WE'LL HAVE TO MEMORIZE THAT.

70
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:04,746
IT SHOULD NOT BE TOO HARD.

71
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:06,748
I SAY PROGROWTH BUT IT WILL

72
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:11,486
TAKE A WHILE TO KICK IN.

73
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:13,020
MARIA: WE'VE ALREADY SEEN

74
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:13,721
STRONG PROGROWTH POLICIES

75
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:14,322
LIFTING ECONOMY.

76
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:15,857
WE HAVE THE JOBS NUMBER UP ON

77
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:16,190
FRIDAY.

78
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:16,858
WHICH SOME PEOPLE QUESTION

79
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:20,828
BEING A LITTLE LOWER THAN

80
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:21,763
EXPECTED BUT THE PRIOR TWO

81
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:22,530
MONTHS WERE REVISED UPWARD.

82
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:23,297
HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE

83
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:25,099
JOBS PICTURE RIGHT NOW AND THE

84
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,170
ECONOMIC GROWTH PROSPECT?

85
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:29,737
>> I THINK IS PRETTY

86
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:30,171
REMARKABLE!

87
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:32,340
YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT THE

88
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:32,807
REVISIONS.

89
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:35,109
PRIOR MONTHS, SEPTEMBER IS

90
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,079
ACTUALLY 211,000 ABOVE AUGUST.

91
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,947
THAT IS A BIG NUMBER.

92
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:42,483
REMARKABLY, 3.7 PERCENT

93
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:43,951
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHICH WE

94
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:45,386
HAVE NOT HAD FOR DECADES, VERY

95
00:02:45,387 --> 00:02:47,188
RARE.

96
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,122
THERE IS BASICALLY NO

97
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:48,489
INFLATION.

98
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,759
HERE IS THE POINT, A GOOD STORY

99
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,226
IN THE PAPER.

100
00:02:52,227 --> 00:02:54,929
YOU KNOW, THE LOWER END IS

101
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,533
ACTUALLY GETTING FASTER WAGE

102
00:02:58,534 --> 00:02:58,933
INCREASES.

103
00:02:58,934 --> 00:02:59,867
I THINK THESE ARE PREDOMINANTLY

104
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:03,971
MARIA, BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS.

105
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:04,839
LESS THAN SOME OF THE TECH

106
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,173
PEOPLE.

107
00:03:05,174 --> 00:03:07,942
BUT THERE ACTUALLY GETTING

108
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:09,877
FASTER WAGE INCREASES THEN THE

109
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:10,244
UPPER END.

110
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:11,345
AND THAT IS PRETTY REMARKABLE,

111
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:11,679
I THINK.

112
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,117
WE'VE SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT

113
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:17,552
BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS, A BIG

114
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:18,286
STORY IN THE PAPER A COUPLE OF

115
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:19,954
WEEKS AGO.

116
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:27,728
BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS HAVE THEIR

117
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:28,629
BEST INCREASE IN MANY YEARS.

118
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,964
PRESIDENT TRUMP YOU KNOW, HAS

119
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:30,965
OPENED UP THE ECONOMY.

120
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:31,699
LOWERED TAX RATES,

121
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,400
DEREGULATION, LOW ENERGY, HE

122
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:33,201
STOPPED THE WAR AGAINST

123
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:34,569
BUSINESS.

124
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,872
HE STOPPED THE WAR AGAINST

125
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:38,439
SUCCESS AND ENERGY.

126
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,373
NOW THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS

127
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:40,341
CRUSHING IT AND IT WILL GO ON

128
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:44,145
FOR A WHILE IN MY JUDGMENT.

129
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:45,780
MARIA: FOR A WHILE IS WHAT

130
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:47,148
PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING.

131
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:48,082
THERE'S A NARRATIVE AS YOU

132
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:48,816
KNOW, THINGS WILL START TO SLOW

133
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:51,018
DOWN PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY GOING

134
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:51,786
TO 2020 AND IN 2020 BECAUSE OF

135
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:55,223
HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND THE

136
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:55,756
DEMOGRAPHIC ISSUES.

137
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:57,825
DO YOU SEE THAT SLOW DOWN ON

138
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:58,860
THE HORIZON?

139
00:03:58,861 --> 00:03:59,861
>> I SURE DON'T!

140
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:05,366
2020 IS A COUPLE OF YEARS AWAY.

141
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:06,868
I THINK THAT WE ARE IN THE

142
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:08,669
BIGGEST CAPITAL GOODS BUSINESS

143
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,141
INVESTMENT SPENDING IN 20

144
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:14,542
YEARS, OKAY?

145
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:15,343
THIS IS AN ECONOMY ALSO IGNORE

146
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:15,943
THE 80S AND 90S.

147
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:17,645
WE BE IN THE TWO PERCENT GROWTH

148
00:04:17,646 --> 00:04:18,346
MARGIN EVERYONE SAID THAT WE

149
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:18,712
COULD NOT.

150
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:19,947
THEY SAY IT WILL BE FOUR

151
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:22,350
PERCENT AGAIN IN THE THIRD

152
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:23,251
QUARTER.

153
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:23,951
OUR TEAM WILL TAKE THREE

154
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:26,554
PERCENT PLUS.

155
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:27,355
THEY SAID IT COULD NOT BE DONE

156
00:04:27,356 --> 00:04:28,155
AND IT IS BEING DONE.

157
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:32,894
CAPITAL GOODS IS GOING TO PUT

158
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,728
BETTER PRODUCTIVITY TO OUR

159
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:34,762
WORKERS, WE ALREADY SEEN THE

160
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:35,162
WAGE GAINS.

161
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:37,798
CONSUMER SPENDING IS HOLDING

162
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:38,165
UP.

163
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,967
I JUST DON'T SEE WHERE THIS IS

164
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:40,902
GOING TO END.

165
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:44,105
ONE LAST POINT.IF YOU CAN

166
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:44,772
KEEP MORE OF WHAT YOU EARN,

167
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:47,942
RIGHT?

168
00:04:47,943 --> 00:04:52,179
IF YOUR PAYCHECKS ARE BIGGER

169
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:59,053
AFTER-TAX, AFTER INFLATION,

170
00:04:59,054 --> 00:04:59,787
THAT GOES ON.

171
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:00,388
IF WE ARE BUILDING NEW

172
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:01,923
BUSINESSES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT,

173
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:02,657
TECHNOLOGY, CAMPUSES, YOU NAME

174
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:02,924
IT.

175
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:03,958
WHY CAN'T THAT GO ON FOR A GOOD

176
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,361
MANY YEARS?

177
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:08,262
WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT IN ALMOST

178
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:08,629
20 YEARS.

179
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,197
MARIA: ONE ISSUE IS THE TRADE

180
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:11,098
FIGHT WITH CHINA, THAT PRICES

181
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:11,866
ARE GOING UP FOR SOME COMMON

182
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:12,566
GOODS THAT PEOPLE BUY BECAUSE

183
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:13,334
OF THESE TARIFFS IN PLACE.

184
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:14,735
I KNOW IT IS MORE THAN JUST AN

185
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:15,469
ECONOMIC ISSUE.

186
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,203
WE HAVE GOT A MAP HERE OF THE

187
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:17,738
SOUTH CHINA SEA.

188
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,307
BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE

189
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:22,376
ISSUES MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

190
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:23,110
SAYING IS ONE FOR AMERICA WITH

191
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:26,480
REGARD TO NATIONAL SECURITY.

192
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:27,448
CHINA IS BUILDING ISLANDS IN

193
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:28,149
THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.

194
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,350
WHICH WE ALL KNOW.

195
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:31,585
IT IS BUILDING ISLANDS AND THAT

196
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:33,120
IS WHERE A MILITARY BASE IS.

197
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:36,157
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE WHERE THIS

198
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:40,861

NOW THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE

200
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,097
THIS DEAL WITH CANADA AND

201
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:43,898
MEXICO?

202
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:44,632
AND I WENT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON

203
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:48,169
EUROPE AND JAPAN AS WELL.

204
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,038
>> LOOK, THE WHOLE STORY ON

205
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:51,672
TRADE IS COMING TOGETHER

206
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:52,006
NICELY.

207
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:53,240
THE PRESIDENTS STRATEGY APPEARS

208
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:54,141
TO BE WORKING.

209
00:05:54,142 --> 00:06:00,147
WE SEE THIS WITH USNCA.

210
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:01,415
WE ARE HOLDING TRADE

211
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,451
NEGOTIATIONS WITH EUROPE,

212
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:06,887
JAPAN, THE THREE COUNTRIES

213
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:13,160
BASICALLY SAYING, NONMARKET

214
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:13,828
ECONOMIES, THEY HAVE GOT TO

215
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:14,662
SHAPE UP.

216
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:15,963
CHINA IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST

217
00:06:15,964 --> 00:06:18,366
CULPRIT, AS YOU KNOW.

218
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:23,738
LOOK, THE KEY ISSUES HERE, HIGH

219
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:25,773
TARIFFS, TECHNOLOGY THEFT.

220
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:29,410
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT.

221
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:30,611
THERE IS A STORY IN THE WALL

222
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:33,080
STREET JOURNAL YESTERDAY.

223
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:35,950
CHINA EXPANDS ITS CYBERSECURITY

224
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:40,921
RULEBOOK.

225
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:41,856
HEIGHTENING FOREIGN CORPORATE

226
00:06:41,857 --> 00:06:42,223
CONCERNS.

227
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:42,723
THIS IS BRAND-NEW.

228
00:06:42,724 --> 00:06:43,958
THEY ARE PUTTING IN NEW RULES

229
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,592
THAT WILL PREVENT CHINESE

230
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:45,593
OFFICIALS TO INSPECT U.S.

231
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:46,961
COMPANIES AND ALL FOREIGN

232
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:48,162
COMPANIES INFORMATION TECH AND

233
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:51,065
ACCESS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.

234
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,199
THIS IS EXACTLY A STEP IN THE

235
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,568
WRONG DIRECTION.

236
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:56,170
THIS IS FORCED TECHNOLOGY

237
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:58,506
TRANSFER.

238
00:06:58,507 --> 00:06:59,440
THIS IS IP THEFT, THIS IS

239
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:01,976
EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN WARNING

240
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:02,276
ABOUT.

241
00:07:02,277 --> 00:07:02,977
WE TRIED TO COMMUNICATE THESE

242
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:04,011
CONCERNS TO CHINA.

243
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:11,419
SO FAR, WE HAVE NOT HAD LUCK.

244
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,887
WE WILL TALK TO THEM, SERIOUS

245
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:13,821
SIGNIFICANT TALKS ANYTIME.

246
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:14,588
BUT IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THEY

247
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:15,322
ARE MOVING IN THE WRONG

248
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:15,856
DIRECTION RIGHT NOW.

249
00:07:15,857 --> 00:07:16,857
I THINK THIS IS MOST

250
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:17,258
UNFORTUNATE.

251
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:18,459
YOU TALK ABOUT NATIONAL

252
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,427
SECURITY ISSUES, WE CAN TALK

253
00:07:19,428 --> 00:07:22,963
ABOUT ECONOMIC SECURITY ISSUES.

254
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:23,731
WHY SHOULD WE ALLOW THE CHINESE

255
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:24,432
TO OWN AMERICAN COMPANIES IN

256
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:29,470
CHINA AND MOREOVER, FORCE US TO

257
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:31,472
LAY OUT ALL OF OUR TECHNOLOGY

258
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:32,173
BLUEPRINTS AND IN THE NAME OF

259
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:35,609
CYBERSECURITY WHICH BY THE WAY,

260
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,177
THEY CYBER HACKED US

261
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:36,644
CONSTANTLY.

262
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:39,146
WHY SHOULD WE GIVE THEM NEW

263
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:43,751
ADVANTAGES IN THIS RACETRAC

264
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:50,023
MARIA: WE ARE BACK WITH LARRY

265
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:50,457
KUDLOW.

266
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,058
YOU ARE DEALING WITH A DICTATOR

267
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:52,559
FOR LIFE IN CHINA.

268
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,360
CHINA WILL NOT ADMIT THEY BEEN

269
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:56,029
STEALING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

270
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,630
AND FORCING TRANSFER OF

271
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:57,430
TECHNOLOGY.

272
00:07:57,431 --> 00:07:58,131
ARE YOU SURE TARIFFS WILL BE

273
00:07:58,132 --> 00:07:58,932
THE THING TOACTUALLY MOVE THE

274
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:00,600
NEEDLE ?

275
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:05,805
>> LOOK, I DON'T KNOW.

276
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:07,474
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY

277
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:09,776
STRONG ON THIS ISSUE.

278
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:13,914
A LOT OF PEOPLE BLAMING POTUS

279
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:15,916
FOR IMPOSING TARIFFS AS PART OF

280
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:16,449
THE TRADE STRATEGY.

281
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,784
HE IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A

282
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:18,251
TRADE REFORMER.

283
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:21,555
AS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW.

284
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:24,257
WE HAVE GIVEN CHINA OUR ASKS.

285
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:25,425
ANY NUMBER OF TIMES.

286
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:28,562
REGARDING TECHNOLOGY ISSUES AND

287
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:29,896
IP AND TARIFFS.

288
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:31,965
AND THE TRADE IMBALANCES AND SO

289
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:32,399
FORTH.

290
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,269
I THINK YOU KNOW THAT TOO.

291
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,804
MY ADVICE IS, DO NOT BLAME

292
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:39,405
TRUMP, HELP US.

293
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:40,307
DO NOT HURT US, HELP US BECAUSE

294
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:44,077
IT HAS TO BE A LEVEL PLAYING

295
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:48,381
FIELD, RECIPROCITY.

296
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:49,649
CHINA REGRETTABLY, IS NOT

297
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,217
PLAYING BY THE RULES.

298
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:52,352
AND HAS NOT PLAYED BY THOSE

299
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:55,589
RULES FOR MANY YEARS PRIOR TO

300
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,323
U.S. PRESIDENTS GIVEN SERVICE,

301
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:57,357

TOUGHEST REBUTTAL AND ACTIONS

303
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:04,397
AGAINST THEM.

304
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:05,098
YOU HAVE TO PROTECT THE U.S.

305
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:06,032
ECONOMY AND TECHNOLOGY IN

306
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:06,666
FAMILY JEWELS.

WORKFORCE AND THE BUSINESSES.

309
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:13,440
THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF

310
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:14,140
AMERICA'S FREE MARKET ECONOMY.

311
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:15,775
THE PRESIDENT IS DOING JUST

312
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:17,377
THAT.

313
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:20,280
MAYBE A SIT DOWN AT THE G 20 IN

314
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,047
ARGENTINA, MAYBE NOT.I WILL

315
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:23,917
PUT THAT OUT THERE.

316
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:24,684
OUR ALLIES ARE WORKING WITH US,

317
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:26,853
THE EU AND JAPAN.

318
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:27,621
REALLY, OBJECTIVELY.

319
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:29,155
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT

320
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:31,291
CREDIT ON THIS.

321
00:09:31,292 --> 00:00:00,000
HE HAS TAKEN THE FIGHT TO CHINA
