THEY SEND THEIR DUMB NUMBER ONE DIPLOMAT INTO A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING IN NEW YORK. JOHN ROBERTS JOINS US FROM THE NORTH ONE. Reporter: JUST MOMENTS AGO THE SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO ISSUED A TWEET SAYING, LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING IN NEW YORK. WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE COMPLETE, VERIFIABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. THEY ARE PROCEEDING AS IF IT IS IN PLACE FOR JUNE 12TH. PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO TODAY. A STRATEGY SESSION AHEAD OF POMPEO'S MEETINGS IN NEW YORK WITH NORTH KOREAN VICE PRESIDENT KIM JONG-CHUL, A PRELUDE TO THE POSSIBLE SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN POSSIBLE SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG U KIM JONG UN. WE ARE CONTINUING TO PREPARE FOR THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER. AS THE PRESIDENT SAYS, IF IT HAPPENS, WE WILL CERTAINLY BE READY. THE WHITE HOUSE AS BOTH HIS TEAM'S DISPATCH TO SINGAPORE AND THE DMZ HAS BEEN ENGAGING WITH NORTH KOREAN DELEGATION. THE ADVANCE TEAM LED BY DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF JOE HAGAN MET WITH THE NORTH KOREAN TEAM IN SINGAPORE EARLIER TODAY. THE U.S. DELEGATION LED BY AMBASSADOR KIM MET WITH NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS EARLIER TODAY AND THEIR TALKS WILL CONTINUE. SO FAR THE READ OUT FROM THESE MEETINGS HAS BEEN POSITIVE. Reporter: AS HE TOURED HIS PRESIDENTIAL SPORT AND FITNESS EVENT TODAY, HE TOOK ANOTHER SWING AT HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL, JEFF SESSIONS, AFTER CONGRESSMAN TREY GOWDY SAID THIS MORNING HE UNDERSTANDS THE PRESIDENT'S FRUSTRATION THAT SESSIONS RECUSED HIMSELF IN THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION. IF I WERE THE PRESIDENT AND I PICKED SOMEONE TO BE THE COUNTRY'S CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, AND THEY TOLD ME LATER, OH, BY THE WAY, I CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE IN THE OFFICE, I WOULD BE FRUSTRATED, TOO. THAT'S HOW I READ THAT. SENATOR SESSIONS, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS BEFORE I PICKED DEAL? HE COULD HAVE PICKED SOMEONE ELSE. THE PRESIDENT TWEETED TO GAUDI'S ENTIRE QUOTE ABOUT PICKING SOMEONE ELSE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL, ADDING IN THE WORDS, AND I WISH I DID. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED TODAY THAT SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER IS LOOKING INTO A MARCH 17 MEETING THAT TRUMP HAD WITH SESSIONS AT MAR-A-LAGO, A MEETING IN WHICH HE REPORTEDLY ASKED SESSIONS TO REVERSE HIS RECUSAL. SOURCES WITH THE INVESTIGATION TELL FOX NEWS THAT MUELLER NEVER SPOKE ABOUT THAT. BUT IN HIS LIST OF QUESTIONS FOR THE PRESIDENT, MUELLER WAS CLEARLY INTERESTED IN THE ISSUE ASKING, WHAT DID YOU THINK AND WHAT DID YOU DO REGARDING AG SESSIONS RECUSAL? AND WHAT DID YOU TRY TO DO TO GET HIM TO CHANGE HIS MIND AND REVERSE? WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS IN LOCKSTEP WITH GAUDI, HE WAS OVER GAUDI'S ASSERTION THAT THE FBI DID NOTHING WRONG. BUT THIS DISPATCHING A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT TO GET CLOSE TO SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN. I'M EVEN MORE CONVINCED THAT THE FBI DID EXACTLY WHAT MY FELLOW CITIZENS WOULD WANT HIM TO DO WHEN I GOT THE INFORMATION THEY GOT, AND THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP. Reporter: THE PRESS SECRETARY TODAY SAID IT, NOT SO FAST. IF THE PRESIDENT STILL HAS CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE FBI ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY, HAVING PEOPLE IN HIS CAMPAIGN, AND CERTAINLY, THE PRESIDENT HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THE OVERALL CONDUCT OF THE FBI WHEN IT COMES TO THIS PROCESS. Reporter: TO PROVE THAT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, REALITY TELEVISION STAR KIM KARDASHIAN STROLLED ACROSS WEST EXECUTIVE DRIVE AND INTO THE WHITE HOUSE LATER THIS AFTERNOON. SHE'S HERE FOR DISCUSSIONS WITH JARED KUSHNER ON PRISON REFORM AND ALSO ADVOCATING FOR A PARDON FOR A GREAT GRANDMOTHER WHO HAS BEEN IN PRISON ON A NONVIOLENT DRUG CHARGE SINCE 1996. ALSO SPOTTED AT THE WHITE HOUSE, RUDY GIULIANI, WHO TOLD THE PRESS HE HAS BEEN CONDUCTING PRESS PREP SESSIONS LOOK AT THE
