now bidco for people who don't know that's the company that the city of calgary has set up to just examine whether or not calgary is going to go home go forward with an Olympic bid now that has been set up it's expensive from what I understand and it's also been set up as a private corporation to protect it from transparency you're absolutely right so big coat setup will be the official group who goes forward with the Olympic bid to the IOC on behalf of Calgary it is funded by our tax dollars a hundred percent and has a CEO who was just recently named to to lead the initiative their mandate is to put together the bid subject to the approval by Calgarians of Calvary pursuing an Olympic bid in in for the 2026 Olympics this fall but as you and I've just talked about a little bit there's some questions around big COEs role and their impartiality in calories pursuing this Olympic bid because as we just found out the CEO of bit Co gets two bonuses one if you know Calgary wins the 2026 Olympics down the road if we're awarded it by the IOC but she also gets a bonus if the plebiscite votes in favour of holding an Olympics so to me that's a clear conflict where the city says there's no taxpayer support for the pro Olympic campaign but the CEO of the Olympic bidding company gets a bonus if people vote in the plaza say yes to the Olympics so not quite sure how the city thinks that that means no taxpayer dollars are going to the pro Olympic campaign that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
