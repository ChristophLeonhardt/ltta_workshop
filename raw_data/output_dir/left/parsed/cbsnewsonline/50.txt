>> AND EXCEPT FOR A LOT OF THE 
FAKE NEWS THAT YOU SEE FROM 
THESE PEOPLE BACK HERE -- 
>> 
>> THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE TIME 
FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN. 
>> 
>> AMERICA IS BEING RESPECTED 
AGAIN. 
>> 
>> BECAUSE WE ARE FINALLY 
PUTTING AMERICA FIRST AGAIN. 
>> 
>> WE HAVE THE BEST ECONOMY IN 
OUR HISTORY. 
>> 
>> AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS 
-- IF OUR OPPONENT GOT INTO 
OFFICE, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
VERY SAD SAD PERIOD OF TIME -- 
INSTEAD OF -- IT IS A PRETTY 
SAD DAY, ISN'T IT? 
DON'T WORRY, IT'S ALL GOING TO 
GET BETTER. 
IT'S ALL GOING TO GET BETTER. 
>>  
>> BUT IF OUR OPPONENT GOT INTO 
OFFICE, YOUR 401(K)'S INSTEAD 
OF BEING UP 52% IN A SHORT 
PERIOD OF TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN 
DOWN 52%. 
THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING TO 
HAPPEN. 
THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING TO 
HAPPEN. 
THAT'S WHERE IT WAS GOING. 
WAGES RIGHT NOW ARE RISING AND 
POVERTY IS -- YOU SEE IT. 
POVERTY IS PLUMMETING. 
JOBLESS CLAIMS JUST HIT A 50-
YEAR LOW, 50, 5-0. AND THE 
STOCK MARKET TODAY JUST HIT 
ANOTHER ALL-TIME HIGH. 
>> 
>> WE ARE FIGHTING, EVERY DAY, 
FOR OUR FACTORIES, OUR RANCHERS,
OUR GREAT MINERS, OUR FARMERS, 
AND WE ARE NOW
THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF ENERGY 
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. 
>> 
>> AND IT'S NOT BY LUCK. 
WE ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, 
WE ARE CRUSHING THE TERRORISTS, 
AND WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR 
GREAT VETERANS, WE ARE TAKING 
CARE OF THEM. 
>> 
>> FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME. 
WE'VE ALSO JUST IDENTIFIED THE 
FIRST REMAINS OF OUR FALLEN 
WARRIORS FROM NORTH KOREA. 
THESE INCREDIBLE HEROES. 
THEY CAN NOW LAY AT REST IN 
AMERICAN SOIL. 
A LOT OF PROGRESS BEING MADE ON 
NORTH KOREA. 
A LOT OF PROGRESS. 
DO YOU REMEMBER BEFORE I CAME 
IN, IT LOOKS LIKE WE WERE GOING 
TO WAR WITH NORTH KOREA, NOW 
WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS, 
RELATIONSHIPS ARE GETTING 
BETTER AND BETTER. 
AND WE HAVE OUR HOSTAGES BACK. 
AND THERE'S NO MORE NUCLEAR 
TESTING. 
AND THERE'S NO TESTING OF 
MISSILES AND ROCKETS OVER 
JAPAN. 
WE ARE DOING WELL. 
AND WE ARE GETTING OUR REMAINS 
BACK, VERY IMPORTANT. 
WE BELIEVE NO AMERICAN SHOULD 
BE LEFT BEHIND. 
SO WE HAVE MIDTERMS COMING UP. 
AND YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD 
THAT GREAT, GREAT ELECTION, 
ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO -- CAN YOU 
BELIEVE IT? 
AND DO YOU REMEMBER THE TEARS 
FROM THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA? 
WHEN IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT WE 
WERE GOING TO WIN? 
>> 
>> AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THERE -- THEY ARE STILL CRYING, 
LOOK AT THEM, STILL CRYING. 
THEY'RE STILL CRYING. 
AND LET THEM CRY. 
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
HAPPENED, BUT IT HAPPENED AND 
THAT'S WHY WE ARE SETTING ALL-
TIME RECORDS, THAT'S WHY WE ARE 
DOING SO WELL. 
BUT WE HAVE TO GET OUT FOR THE 
MIDTERMS, PROMISE ME, YOU'VE 
GOT TO GET OUT FOR THEM -- 
DON'T BE COMPLACENT. 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT FOR THE 
MIDTERMS. 
YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE. 
YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE, WE NEED 
MORE REPUBLICANS. 
WHEN THEY SAY WE HAVE A 
MAJORITY, IT'S LIKE THIS, IT'S 
LIKE THIS. 
IF SOMEBODY HAS A COLD, WE 
DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY THAT DAY. 
IT'S LIKE WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE 
REPUBLICANS IN OFFICE. 
WE'LL GET EVERYTHING WE WANT SO 
FAST. 
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE IT. 
SO TONIGHT, WE ARE JOINED BY 
SOME REALLY TERRIFIC FRIENDS OF 
MINE AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS, 
FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NEVADA. 
INCLUDING TWO GREAT CANDIDATES 
FOR CONGRESS. 
CRESCENT HARDY, WHERE IS 
CRESCENT? 
AND SOMEBODY THAT'S BEEN 
SUPPORTING ME A LONG TIME. 
AND HE HAS SHOWN SUCH 
INCREDIBLE STAMINA AND LOYALTY 
AND FRIENDSHIP -- AND WE GOT TO 
GET HIM TO WIN THIS RACE. 
DANNY TARKANIAN. 
DANNY? 
THANKS, DANNY, WHAT A GREAT 
GUY, THANK YOU, DANNY. 
DANNY, THANK YOU FOR 
EVERYTHING. 
YOU REALLY ARE -- YOU'VE DONE A 
GREAT JOB, THANK YOU, MAN, 
THEY'RE GOING TO GET YOU IN, 
VOTE FOR TARKANIAN! 
ALSO, YOUR NEXT GOVERNOR, A 
VERY POPULAR GUY, IN THESE 
PARTS, WITH A GREAT FAMILY, ADAM
LAXALT. 
AND ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE, WHO 
REALLY WAS OUTSTANDING, 
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A 
LITTLE -- TO USE AN INTERESTING 
WORD -- BIAS FOR THIS AREA. 
I LOVE THIS AREA, YOU KNOW THE 
WORD BIAS? 
THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BIAS,
THEIR BIAS, YEAH, THERE WAS A 
LOT OF BIAS, YOU KNOW THAT. 
BUT I HAVE BIAS FOR THIS AREA, 
AND ALSO FOR OUR GREAT GOP 
CHAIRMAN MICHAEL McDONALD. 
FINALLY, I WANT YOU TO PLEASE 
WELCOME THE PERSON THAT WE ARE  
I HAVE TO SAY THIS, WE STARTED 
OUT -- WE WERE NOT FRIENDS. 
I DIDN'T LIKE HIM, HE DIDN'T 
LIKE ME. 
AND AS WE FOUGHT AND FOUGHT AND 
FOUGHT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WE 
STARTED TO RESPECT EACH OTHER, 
THEN WE STARTED TO LIKE EACH 
OTHER, THEN WE STARTED TO LOVE 
EACH OTHER. 
AND THE FACT IS, AND THE FACT IS
HE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS 
SUPPORTER, EVER SINCE I WON THE 
ELECTION, HE'S ALWAYS BEEN 
THERE, WE CAN COUNT ON HIS 
VOTE. 
I MEAN, WACKY JACKIE WILL NEVER 
VOTE FOR US, FOLKS, NEVER. 
SHE'S WACKY. 
SHE'S NEVER GOING TO VOTE FOR 
US. 
YOU CAN COUNT ON HIS VOTE. 
FOR SECOND AMENDMENT, FOR TAX 
REDUCTIONS, FOR REGULATION 
CUTS. 
FOR JUDGES, OH, LOOK AT OUR 
JUDGES. 
OH. 
WHAT'S GOING ON? 
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE REASONS I 
WAS ELECTED WAS BECAUSE YOU 
BELIEVED THAT I WAS GOING TO 
PICK GREAT SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICES. 
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH -- 
>> 
>> AND I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING 
ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE BUT I WANT 
TO TELL YOU THAT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH IS ONE OF THE FINEST 
HUMAN BEINGS YOU WILL EVER HAVE 
THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING OR 
MEETING. 
>> 
>> A GREAT INTELLECT, A GREAT 
GENTLEMAN, AN IMPECCABLE 
REPUTATION, WENT TO GAIL, TOP 
STUDENT, WENT TO YALE LAW 
SCHOOL, TOP STUDENT, SO WE GOT 
TO LET IT PLAY OUT, BUT I WANT 
TO TELL YOU, HE IS A FINE, FINE 
PERSON. 
-- HE WENT TO YALE. 
AND HE'S GOT TREMENDOUS 
SUPPORT. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT, 
TREMENDOUS. 
JUST LIKE NEIL GORSUCH, WHO IS 
NOW ON THE SUPREME COURT. 
HAS TREMENDOUS SUPPORT. 
SO WE WILL LET IT PLAY OUT. 
AND I THINK EVERYTHING IS GOING 
TO BE JUST FINE, THIS IS A HIGH 
QUALITY PERSON. 
AND A MAN THAT AGREES WITH 
THAT, AND RIGHT NOW, HIS VOTE 
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MINE, 
BECAUSE HE'S GOT TO HELP
BRETT GET IN. 
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, HE 
RESPECTS HIM JUST LIKE I 
RESPECT HIM. 
BUT WITH DEAN, WE CAN COUNT ON 
HIM. 
WITH JACKIE, SHE'S NEVER GOING 
TO VOTE FOR US. 
SHE MAY TALK IT, SHE EVEN SAYS 
A LOT OF THE STATES WHERE THEY 
LIKE TRUMP, THESE CANDIDATES ON 
THE OTHER SIDE
-- THEY GET UP AND THEY TALK 
NICELY ABOUT ME. 
BUT THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO 
VOTE. 
THEY SAY, TRUMP IS WONDERFUL, 
WE LIKE HIM A LOT, I WON THE 
STATE BY LIKE, 34 POINTS AND 
THEY GET UP AND THEY SAY, WE 
LIKE HIM A LOT, HE'S GREAT, 
HE'S WONDERFUL BUT THEY'RE 
NEVER GOING TO VOTE FOR US SO 
IT DOESN'T MATTER. 
I'D RATHER HAVE THEM SAY BAD 
THINGS ABOUT ME AND GIVE US 
THEIR VOTE, THEY'RE NEVER GOING 
TO VOTE FOR US BECAUSE THEY ARE 
VOTING FOR NANCY PELOSI, THEIR 
VOTING FOR -- 
>> 
>> THEY'RE VOTING FOR THE NEW 
DE FACTO LEADER OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, MAXINE 
WATERS. 
>> 
>> AND THEIR VOTING -- THEY'RE 
VOTING FOR CRYING CHUCK 
SCHUMER. 
WHEREAS YOUR INCREDIBLE SENATOR 
DEAN HELLER IS GOING TO BE WITH 
US ALL THE TIME. 
COME ON UP HERE, DEAN. 
COME ON UP HERE, DEAN. 
DEAN HELLER. 
>> 
>> HEY! 
>> 
>> BOY, DOES THIS PRESIDENT 
KNOW HOW TO PACK PEOPLE INTO 
ONE ROOM? 
THIS IS INCREDIBLE! 
>> 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, I THINK YOU 
JUST TURNED NEVADA READ TODAY. 
>> 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, WELCOME TO 
LAS VEGAS. 
HOME OF THE RUNNIN' REBELS. 
HOME OF THE GOLDEN KNIGHTS. 
>> 
>> AND THE FUTURE HOME OF THE 
LAS VEGAS RAIDERS! 
>> 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, WE HAVE 
300,000 VETERANS IN THE STATE 
OF NEVADA. 
>> 
>> THEY ARE IN FRONT OF US AND 
THEY ARE BEHIND US. 
AND WE ARE THRILLED TO HAVE 
THEM WITH US TODAY. 
THEY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
DELIVERING A BETTER HEALTHCARE 
SYSTEM AT THE VA. 
>> 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, OUR VETERANS 
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING 
THEM THE BENEFITS AND THE 
SUPPORT THAT THEY DESERVE. 
AND, MR. PRESIDENT, WE HAVE 
THOUSANDS, THOUSANDS OF 
MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN THAT 
SERVE HERE IN THE STATE OF 
NEVADA. 
THEY WANT TO THANK YOU, THEY 
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR FUNDING 
OUR ARMED FORCES SO THAT THEY 
CAN DO THEIR JOBS AND SERVE OUR 
COUNTRY. 
>>  
>> MR. PRESIDENT, OUR MILITARY 
MEN AND WOMEN WANT TO THANK YOU 
FOR THE LARGEST PAY RAISE IN 
THE LAST 10 YEARS. 
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, MR. 
PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR 
PUTTING NEVADA BACK TO WORK. 
>> 
>> BECAUSE OF YOUR 
ADMINISTRATION, NEVADA FAMILIES 
HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR 
PAYCHECKS. 
NEVADA FAMILIES HAVE MORE MONEY 
IN THEIR POCKETS. 
AND, MR. PRESIDENT, BECAUSE OF 
THIS STOCK MARKET THAT YOU JUST 
MENTIONED, THEY ARE DOING 
BETTER WITH THEIR PENSIONS AND 
THEIR 401(K)'S. 
MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S AN HONOR TO 
WORK WITH YOU, IN PUTTING 
NEVADA BACK TO WORK, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH, VERY MUCH MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
>> THANK YOU, DEAN. 
THANK YOU, DEAN. 
THANK YOU, DEAN. 
DEAN REALLY IS A CHAMPION AND I 
CAN TELL YOU I WORK WITH HIM -- 
HE'S A CHAMPION FOR OUR 
WORKERS, OUR FAMILIES AND FOR 
OUR VETERANS. 
WE HAVE TO KEEP HIM, HE LED THE 
CHARGE IN CONGRESS TO PASS THE 
MOST SIGNIFICANT VETERANS 
REFORMS IN HALF A CENTURY. 
INCLUDING THE VA ACCOUNTABILITY 
ACT, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. 
THAT MEANS PEOPLE THAT WORK IN 
THE VA ARE ACCOUNTABLE, IF THEY 
DON'T TREAT OUR VETERANS WELL, 
IF THEY DON'T DO A GOOD JOB, IF 
THEY'RE SADISTS AND YOU HAVE 
THAT -- IF THEY STEAL AND YOU 
HAVE THAT -- WE SAY, SORRY, BUT 
YOU ARE FIRED! 
>> 
>> BEFORE, YOU COULDN'T DO 
THAT. 
YOU COULDN'T DO IT. 
NOW YOU CAN DO IT. 
THAT'S BEEN 45 YEARS I'VE BEEN 
TRYING TO GET IT, IT DOESN'T 
SOUND LIKE MUCH, IT'S 
EVERYTHING. 
SO MUCH. 
AND! 
MOST IMPORTANT, 46 YEARS, VA 
CHOICE. 
THIS IS WHERE A VETERAN HAS TO 
WAIT LONG PERIODS TO SEE A 
DOCTOR. 
NO LONGER. 
THEY NOW GO AND SEE A PRIVATE 
DOCTOR IF THERE'S A LINE, THEY 
DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR 12 DAYS, 
FOR 20 DAYS, FOR 40 DAYS. 
THEY GO SEE A DOCTOR, WE PAY 
FOR THE DOCTOR. 
AND THEY GET TAKEN CARE OF. 
THEY GET TAKEN CARE OF. 
AND DEAN HAS LED THE EFFORT IN 
CONGRESS TO FULLY FUND VETERANS 
AFFAIRS, IT'S A BIG DEAL AND 
HE'S BEEN REALLY GREAT, HE 
REALLY HAS. 
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY, THERE'S 
BEEN NO FOOT -- NO BETTER 
FRIEND, WE STARTED OFF SLOW, 
BUT WE ENDED UP STRONG. 
I'VE HAD NO BETTER FRIEND IN 
CONGRESS THAN DEAN HELLER. 
SO THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
>>  
>> WE'VE GOT TO ELECT 
REPUBLICANS. 
THAT MEANS OUR GREAT 
CONGRESSMEN, POTENTIAL 
CONGRESSMEN, AND WE HAVE TO GET 
DEAN. 
TO FIGHT FOR NEVADA, TO FIGHT 
FOR OUR HEROES. 
AND TO HELP US MAKE THINGS 
HONEST AROUND HERE. 
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. 
SO WE ARE GOING TO DRAIN THE 
SWAMP. 
DRAIN THE SWAMP. 
EARLY VOTING, SO IMPORTANT, 
EARLY VOTING STARTS IN EXACTLY 
ONE MONTH, OCTOBER 20. 
SO YOU CAN VOTE EARLY, BUT 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE 
AND REMEMBER THIS, DEAN'S 
DEMOCRAT OPPONENT, WACKY JACKY, 
JACKY ROSEN -- SHE DOESN'T GET 
IT. 
JACKY ROSEN IS BOUGHT AND PAID 
FOR BY HER DONORS, 100%. 
SHE DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO GO TO 
A DEBATE WITH DEAN, SHE DOESN'T 
WANT A DEBATE, I SAID, DEAN, 
WHEN IS THE DEBATE? 
AND HE SAID SHE WON'T DEBATE 
ME. 
THAT'S NOT GOOD. 
THAT'S NOT GOOD. 
ROSEN DOESN'T REPRESENT 
NEVADA'S VALUES, SHE REPRESENTS 
THE EXTREME LIBERAL VALUES. 
FOR OUT-OF-STATE DONORS, 
FUNDING ALMOST 90% OF HER 
CAMPAIGN. 
BUT EVEN THAT, JUST SO YOU 
UNDERSTAND, SHE'S GOING TO DO 
WHATEVER PELOSI AND SCHUMER 
TELL HER TO DO, OKAY? 
THAT DOESN'T MATTER. 
EVERY ONE OF THEM, THEY COME IN 
AND SAY WE WANT TO BE 
BIPARTISAN, THERE NEVER -- 
THEY'LL NEVER VOTE FOR US. 
JACKY ROSEN VOTED NO ON TAX 
CUTS. 
YOU KNOW THAT. 
SHE VOTED FOR THE DISASTER -- 
WHICH IS REALLY CHANGED RAPIDLY 
-- YOU KNOW WE GOT RID OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, THE MOST 
UNPOPULAR THING -- THE DISASTER 
KNOWN AS OBAMACARE. 
JACKY ROSEN VOTED AGAINST CASE 
LAW, -- 
>> 
>> AND SHE VOTED IN FAVOR OF 
DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES, WHICH 
NOBODY WANTS. 
>>  
>> AND JACKY ROSEN VOTED AGAINST
THE VA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, HOW 
DO YOU DO THAT? 
HOW DO YOU DO THAT? 
SO SHE REALLY, IF YOU THINK 
ABOUT IT, SHE VOTED FOR 
CRIMINAL ALIENS AGAINST THE 
RUNS, FOR CRIMINAL -- AGAINST 
VETERANS, FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS 
AGAINST CITIZENS OF OUR 
COUNTRY, THAT'S WHERE SHE IS, 
YOU DON'T WANT THAT, YOU DON'T 
WANT IT. 
A VOTE FOR WACKY JACKY IS A 
VOTE FOR THE EXTREME AGENDA OF 
THOSE PEOPLE. 
THAT'S PELOSI, SCHUMER, WATERS, 
IT'S A VOTE FOR MORE TAXES, 
SERIOUSLY. 
IT'S A VOTE FOR MORE TAXES, 
MORE CRIME, AND MORE ONEROUS 
REGULATION, WHICH STOPS 
EVERYTHING FROM HAPPENING. 
YOU KNOW, WE CUT REGULATIONS 
MORE THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, AND 
I DID IT IN LESS THAN TWO 
YEARS. 
>> 
>> AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS 
THAT YOU HAVE ALL OF THOSE JOBS,
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT 
YOU CAN NOW GO OUT AND LOOK FOR 
ANOTHER JOB IF YOU'RE NOT 
HAPPY. 
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO HIRE 
YOU AND YOU ARE GETTING HIGHER 
WAGES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 21 
YEARS. 
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE 
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS RADICAL 
SOCIALISM AND OPEN BORDERS. 
>> 
>> AND I WON'T ALLOW THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA TO BECOME THE 
NEXT VENEZUELA. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. 
>>  BUILD THAT 
WALL! 
>> SO WE STARTED THE WALL A 
YEAR AGO. 
WE'VE DONE A LOT. 
WE'VE REBUILT A LOT OF SECTIONS 
OF WALL, SAN DIEGO AND A LOT OF 
AREAS, WE ARE STARTING A BIG 
BRAND-NEW SECTION. 
WE SPENT 1.6 BILLION AND THEN 
ANOTHER 1.6 BILLION, 
UNFORTUNATELY, SADLY, BECAUSE OF
THE DEMOCRATS' OBSTRUCTION, 
ONLY 1.6 BILLION, SOUNDS LIKE A 
LOT, BUT IT'S NOT WHEN YOU ARE 
TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT, 1.6 BILLION WAS 
JUST APPROVED. I'M NOT 
THRILLED. 
BUT AFTER THE ELECTION, THEY 
ARE ALL TELLING ME WE ARE 
GETTING OUR WALL THE WAY WE 
WANT IT, SO LET'S SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS. 
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
LET'S SEE IF THEY PRODUCE. 
IN THIS ELECTION, AND BY THE 
WAY, WE WANT THAT WALL, WE WANT 
THAT WALK, YOU KNOW WHERE I AM. 
I COULD KNOCK IT OUT -- BECAUSE 
I DO THAT WELL -- THAT'S WHAT I 
DO WELL, I BUILD. 
WE COULD KNOCK THAT WALL OUT IN 
ONE YEAR IF THEY GAVE US THE 
FUNDS. 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THOUGH, IF 
YOU LOOK AT SCHUMER AND THESE 
PEOPLE, EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW 
YOU NEED THE WALL, THEY VOTED 
FOR THE WALL IN 2006, THEY 
VOTED FOR BORDER SECURITY. 
AND THEN THEY FOUND OUT, GEE, 
MAYBE, FROM THEIR STANDPOINT, 
THEY CAN'T DO THAT, BUT THEY 
ALL VOTED FOR IT. 
HILLARY CLINTON VOTED FOR IT, 
RIGHT? 
REMEMBER HER? 
>>  
>> BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS, I'LL 
TELL YOU THIS -- EVERYBODY 
KNOWS --
>>  LOCK HER UP! 
>> HOW IS OUR JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT DOING? 
>> 
>> SO THEY ALL WANTED THE WALL. 
WE ARE GOING TO GET THE WALL. 
BUT IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER IF 
YOU GET REPUBLICANS IN THEIR TO 
VOTE, PLEASE, OKAY? 
A LOT EASIER. 
BECAUSE THEIR WHOLE AGENDA ON 
BIGGER THINGS, WE CAN GET, YOU 
SEE WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN, WE'VE 
GOT THINGS THAT -- WE'VE GOT 
700 BILLION TO REBUILD OUR 
MILITARY. 
WE THEN GOT 716 BILLION TO 
REBUILD IT SECOND YEAR, 700 AND 
$716 BILLION. 
BUT THEIR WHOLE AGENDA, THEY 
KNOW WE WANT THE WALL, THEY 
WANT TO OPPOSE IT, THEY WANT TO 
OBSTRUCT IT, THEY WANT TO 
RESIST, YOU KNOW THE CAMPAIGN? 
IT'S CALLED RESIST. 
HONESTLY, THEY ARE LOUSY 
POLITICIANS, THEIR POLICY IS 
TERRIBLE, BUT THEY ARE GOOD AT 
STICKING TOGETHER AND 
RESISTING, THAT'S ALL THEY CAN 
DO. 
AND YOU ARE WITNESSING IT RIGHT 
NOW, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE 
VICTORIOUS. 
YOU WATCH. 
YOU WATCH. 
IT'S ALL THERE GOOD AT, RESIST, 
YOU KNOW THEY SEE THE SIGNS, 
RESIST, RESIST, OH. 
WE ARE FOR BUILDING GREAT 
ECONOMIES, THEY ARE FOR 
RESISTING, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL 
ABOUT. 
BUT THIS ELECTION, YOU HAVE TO 
VOTE FOR CANDIDATES WHO REALLY 
KNOW WHAT YOUR HEART SAYS, WHAT 
YOUR VALUES ARE. 
YOU HAVE SOME GREAT, GREAT 
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. 
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT 
I AM ALWAYS ANGRY AT CONGRESS. 
I'M ANGRY AT DEMOCRATS. 
BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
TO OUR COUNTRY. 
I'M ANGRY AT DEMOCRATS BECAUSE 
OF WHAT THEY DO TO OUR COUNTRY. 
TODAY'S DEMOCRAT PARTY IS HELD 
HOSTAGE BY LEFT-WING HATERS, 
ANGRY MOBS, SOCIALIST FANATICS, 
DEEP STATE BUREAUCRATS, AND 
THEIR FAKE NEWS ALLIES. 
THIS IS THE BIG -- THAT'S THEIR 
BEST PARTNER. 
>>  
>> THAT'S THEIR BEST PARTNER. 
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, THEIR BEST 
ALLY IS THOSE PEOPLE RIGHT 
THERE. 
>> 
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW 
DISHONEST AND CORRUPT SO MUCH 
OF THE MEDIA IS, I CAN'T EVEN 
EXPLAIN IT. 
IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN, NOBODY 
WOULD BELIEVE HE HAD, NOBODY 
WOULD. 
AND I DON'T MEAN EVERYTHING, 
YOU HAVE SOME FINE PEOPLE, SOME 
FINE REPORTERS, I KNOW THEM, 
FINE REPORTERS, LOOK, ALL THE 
RED LIGHTS ARE STARTING TO GO 
OFF. 
YOU HAVE SOME FINE PEOPLE AND 
SOME WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, 
PROFESSIONAL REPORTERS. 
BUT I WATCH THE COVERAGE THAT 
WE GET. 
AND IT IS SO UNFAIR, WE COULD 
HAVE THE GREATEST SUCCESS, LIKE 
FOR INSTANCE IN NORTH KOREA, 
WE'RE DOING GREAT, MOVING 
ALONG. 
WHAT DID THEY SAY? 
THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN SAY. 
SO THEY SAY HE MET WITH THEM! 
THAT'S A DEFEAT BECAUSE WE MET? 
THEY CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE, 
WE HAVE THE HOSTAGES -- THEY 
SAID HE MET! 
SO MANY THINGS THEY COME UP -- 
AND THEN THEY SAY IT'S NOT 
MOVING FAST ENOUGH. 
THEY'VEBEEN COVERING THESE 
DEMOCRATS FOR DECADES, THEY 
HAVEN'T DONE A THING. 
I LEFT, WHAT DID I LEAVE, THREE 
MONTHS AGO? 
WE'RE DOING GREAT. 
BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WILL 
TAKE A GREAT STORY AND MAKE IT 
AS BAD AS POSSIBLE. 
THEY'LL TAKE AN OKAY STORY AND 
MAKE IT HORRIBLE. 
SO I CANNOT TELL YOU STRONGLY 
ENOUGH, THAT IS THE SING 
GREATEST ALLY OF THE DEMOCRATS. 
WITHOUT THEM, THEY WOULDN'T BE 
GETTING 5% OF THE VOTE. 
I'LL TELL YOU, THAT'S TRUE. 
FAKE NEWS. 
FAKE NEWS. 
AND YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY 
THIS, WHEN I WON THE ELECTION, 
WE WON, I DIDN'T WIN, WE WON, 
THE WHOLE THING. 
>> 
>> "THE NEW YORK TIMES," LIKE 
THEY APOLOGIZED TO THEIR 
SUBSCRIBERS, BECAUSE THEY 
COVERED THE ELECTION SO BADLY. 
BECAUSE THEIR SUBSCRIBERS SAY 
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? 
HE GOT NOTHING BUT BAD STORIES. 
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T READ "THE 
NEW YORK TIMES." 
BECAUSE IT'S A DISHONEST 
NEWSPAPER. 
IT'S TERRIBLE. 
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL 
TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN WE WON, 
THEY SUFFERED. 
BUT I SAID, I SAID, I GOT ONE 
THING THAT I WAS -- IN 
INTERVIEWS, I SAID, YOU KNOW 
THE GOOD NEWS? 
I'LL START NOW, GETTING FAIR 
PRESS. 
AND IT HAPPENED FOR ABOUT A 
WEEK. 
AND NOW THEY'RE WORSE THAN THEY 
EVER WERE. 
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE 
MUCH OF AN IMPACT, DOES IT? 
NOT MUCH OF AN IMPACT. 
SO THE RESISTANCE TO AN EXTENT, 
BECAUSE OF THEM, IS FILLED WITH 
ANGER, BECAUSE THEIR POLICIES 
HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AS FAILURE. 
REAL ANGER. 
THE FORCES OPPOSING US IN 
WASHINGTON ARE THE SAME PEOPLE 
WHO SQUANDERED TRILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS OVERSEAS, WHO SACRIFICED
OUR SOVEREIGNTY, WHO SHIPPED 
AWAY OUR JOBS, WHO OVERSAW THE 
GREATEST TRANSFER OF WEALTH IN 
THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR 
COUNTRY. 
AND WE ARE NOW RECOVERING, WE 
ARE BRINGING BACK OUR JOBS, WE 
ARE BRINGING BACK OUR 
COMPANIES. 
>>  
>> IN 2016, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
VOTED TO REJECT THIS CORRUPT 
GLOBALISM. 
HEY, I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, I'M NOT THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE GLOBE. 
>> 
>>  USA! 
USA! 
>> YOU VOTED TO MAKE AMERICA 
GREAT AGAIN. 
WE ARE MAKING AMERICA GREATER 
THAN EVER BEFORE AND IT'S 
HAPPENING BEFORE YOUR EYES. 
BITTER DEMOCRATS AND THEIR 
ESTABLISHMENT CRONIES HAVE 
SPENT EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE 
2016 TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE 
RESULTS OF THIS INCREDIBLE, 
HISTORIC PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
THAT WE WON TOGETHER. 
SO WE WANT TO KEEP IT GOING. 
AND WE WANT TO DO IT THE EASY 
WAY. 
SO THIS ELECTION DAY, GO OUT 
THERE AND VOTE. 
YOU GOT TO VOTE. 
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO GO OUT AND 
GOT TO VOTE. 
I WANT TO GIVE A VICTORY SPEECH 
-- I WANT TO GIVE A VICTORY 
SPEECH ON THE EVENING OF 
ELECTION DAY WHICH IS COMING UP 
VERY QUICKLY, WE ARE GOING TO 
BE TALKING ABOUT AMERICA, WE 
ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT 
THE GREATNESS OF OUR COUNTRY, 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET PEOPLE 
UNDO THE INCREDIBLE JOB THAT 
WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST
ALMOST TWO-YEAR PERIOD. 
SO DON'T FORGET. 
EARLY VOTING, FOLKS. 
EARLY VOTING, OCTOBER 20. 
NOW, WE NEED -- WE NEED -- IN 
THIS ELECTION -- TO DO 
SOMETHING SPECIAL. 
I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S EVER 
GOING TO BE A TIME LIKE WE JUST 
WENT THROUGH. 
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT 
YOU ARE COMPLACENT NOW, YOU WIN 
THE PRESIDENCY, AND YOU ARE 
COMPLACENT. I 
DON'T THINK WE ARE COMPLACENT. 
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DID. 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DID. 
LAST WEEK, I SAID, UPDATE IT, I 
SAID UPDATE IT. I 
WANT TO SHOW YOU -- I DON'T 
BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN ANY 
ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY 
OF THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS DONE 
MORE IN TWO YEARS AND WE ARE 
NOT EVEN UP TO TWO YEARS YET -- 
THAN OUR ADMINISTRATION. 
LOOK AT THIS, SO I SAID, JUST 
WRITE DOWN SOME OF THE THINGS 
-- EACH  ONE, EACH ONE, POINT, 
POINT, POINT, FOUR AND A HALF 
PAGES, ALMOST 4 MILLION JOBS 
CREATED SINCE THE ELECTION, 
MORE AMERICANS ARE NOW EMPLOYED 
THAN
EVER RECORDED BEFORE, THINK OF 
THAT! 
TODAY. 
MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING THAN 
EVER BEFORE. 
WE'VE CREATED MORE THAN 400,000 
MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
REMEMBER WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA 
SAID, YOU CAN'T HAVE 
MANUFACTURING JOBS ANYMORE? 
>> 
>> BY THE WAY, HE IS 
CAMPAIGNING AGAIN. 
THAT'S GOOD NEWS. 
BECAUSE IF THAT DOESN'T SPUR 
YOU ON TO WORK, YOU KNOW, WHEN 
I WAS RUNNING, I SWEAR, I THINK 
HE CAMPAIGNED HARDER THAN 
HILLARY CLINTON. 
AND WE WON BIG, 306-223. 
REMEMBER? 
THERE IS NO WAY, RIGHT? 
THERE IS NO WAY THAT DONALD 
TRUMP GETS TO 270. 
WE GOT TO 306. 
LOOK, MANUFACTURING JOBS, WHICH 
HE SAID YOU'LL NEVER HAVE AGAIN 
-- I'M SAYING WHY WON'T YOU 
HAVE IT? 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE 
ANYTHING? 
THESE ARE THE BEST JOBS, YOU 
KNOW MANUFACTURING, THEY ARE 
LIKE THE BEST JOBS, THE MOST 
IMPORTANT JOBS. 
MANUFACTURING JOBS GROWING AT 
THE FASTEST RATE IN MORE THAN 
30 YEARS. 
ECONOMIC GROWTH, SO THEY SAY, 
WHEN I TOOK THIS OVER, I'M 
TELLING YOU, IT WAS A SICK 
PUPPY, WE WERE HEADED DOWN. 
SO LAST QUARTER, WE HIT GDP, 
4.1, ADJUSTED UPWARD, 4.2%, 
RIGHT? 
LOOK, POINT, POINT, POINT. 
LOOK AT THIS. 
NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS 
RECENTLY HIT A 49-YEAR LOW. 
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? 
SIMPLE. 
THAT MEANS PEOPLE ARE WORKING. 
THEY ARE WORKING. 
YOU KNOW THIS, YOU'VE BEEN 
HEARING. 
AND NOW IT'S EVEN BETTER. 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 
HAS RECENTLY ACHIEVED THE 
LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED! 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE, 
REMEMBER? 
REMEMBER I SAID WHAT DO YOU 
HAVE TO LOSE? 
PEOPLE SAID THAT'S NOT NICE. 
I SAID, HEY, I GO THROUGH A 
CHART, IT TALKED ABOUT THE 
HIGHEST CRIME RATES, WORST 
EDUCATION, WORST HOME, I DID GO 
THROUGH AND I JUST LOOKED UP 
ONE NIGHT AND I SAID, YOU'VE 
ALWAYS BEEN WITH THE DEMOCRATS, 
VOTE FOR ME, WHAT THE DO YOU 
HAVE TO LOSE? 
REMEMBER THAT? 
RIGHT? 
>>  
>> HISPANIC -- ANY HISPANIC 
HERE? 
I THINK SO. 
HISPANIC AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 
IS THE LOWEST RATE IN HISTORY. 
ANY ASIANS, ASIAN? 
ASIAN! 
ANY ASIAN? 
ASIAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 
RECENTLY ACHIEVED THE LOWEST 
RATE EVER RECORDED IN OUR 
HISTORY. 
>>  
>> YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THIS. 
WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT -- I'M 
SORRY -- I'M SORRY -- RECENTLY 
REACHED -- I'M SORRY -- ONLY 
THE LOWEST RATE IN 65 YEARS, 
THAT'S NOT AS GOOD. 
THAT'S NOT AS GOOD AS HISTORY. 
SOON! 
THIS IS IMPORTANT, YOUTH 
UNEMPLOYMENT REESE -- RECENTLY 
HIT THE LOWEST RATE IN 50 
YEARS. 
SO GREAT. 
UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, 
VETERANS UNEMPLOYMENT RECENTLY 
REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE IN 
NUMEROUS DECADES, WHATEVER THAT 
MAYBE. 
ALMOST 3.9 MILLION AMERICANS 
HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF FOOD 
STAMPS, I MEAN, HOW GOOD IS 
THAT? 
THINK OF IT, THEY LIVE BETTER, 
AND IT DOESN'T COST US 
ANYTHING. 
RIGHT? 
HOW GOOD IS THAT? 
WE HAVE COMPANIES NOW UNDER THE 
PLEDGE TO AMERICA'S WORKERS, 
THEY ARE TRAINING UNDER OUR 
VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS,
WORKERS, THERE'S NEVER BEEN 
ANYTHING LIKE THIS. 
WE HAVE RETAIL SALES SURGED 
LAST MONTH, UP OVER 6% OVER 
LAST YEAR. 
WE SIGNED THE BIGGEST PACKAGE 
OF TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. 
>>  
>> AS A RESULT OF THE TAX BILL, 
SMALL BUSINESSES WILL HAVE THE 
LOWEST TOP MARGINAL TAX RATE IN 
MORE THAN 80 YEARS, THAT'S NOT 
BAD. 
WE GOT THROUGH A LITTLE WORK 
AND A LITTLE COORDINATION, THE 
UNITED STATES' BID FOR THE 2028 
SUMMER OLYMPICS IN LOS ANGELES, 
WE GOT IT. 
THAT WAS US. 
WE JUST GOT THE U.S./MEXICO 
CANDIDATE -- WE JUST GOT THE 
WORLD CUP IN 2026, WE NEEDED A 
LOT OF -- I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE 
RECORD NUMBER IN HISTORY OF 
REGULATIONS, THAT'S SUCH A BIG 
DEAL. 
WE ENACTED REGULATORY RELIEF 
FOR COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT 
UNIONS SO THEY CAN NOW GO AND 
LOAN YOU MONEY AGAIN. 
LAST MONTH, THE FDA APPROVED 
MORE AFFORDABLE GENERIC DRUGS 
THAN EVER BEFORE IN ITS 
HISTORY. 
AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID 
WITH THE FDA IS THE THING 
CALLED -- I LOVE THE NAME -- 
RIGHT TO TRY, YOU KNOW WHAT 
THAT IS? 
IT WAS THAT -- IF YOU WERE SICK
, TERMINALLY ILL, AND WE HAD A 
DRUG IN THE HOPPER THAT LOOKED 
LIKE IT WAS REALLY WORKING OUT, 
THIS COUNTRY, FOR 50 YEARS -- 
WOULD NOT LET YOU USE THAT 
DRUG, THEY WOULD SAY, IT MAY 
HARM YOU, WELL, YOU ARE 
TERMINALLY ILL. 
SO THEY COULDN'T GET -- THERE 
WAS A REASON -- NOT THAT EASY 
-- A LOT OF LIABILITY, A LOT OF 
EVERYTHING -- BETWEEN THE 
INSURANCE COMPANIES AND VARIOUS 
DIFFERENT THINGS -- INCLUDING 
GOVERNMENT! 
I GOT IT DONE. 
IT'S CALLED RIGHT TO TRY. 
SO NOW INSTEAD OF IF YOU HAVE 
MONEY, IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY, 
YOU JUST GO TO YOUR ROOM. 
IF YOU HAVE MONEY, I KNOW 
PEOPLE, THEY TRAVELED ALL OVER 
THE WORLD, BEGGING FOR A CURE. 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST MEDICAL 
PEOPLE, THE GREATEST MEDICINES 
IN THE WORLD. 
NOW YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO TRY. 
AND IT'S GOING TO WORK PLENTY. 
IT'S A BIG THING. 
WE JUST SECURED $6 BILLION FOR 
THE NEW FUNDING TO FIGHT THE 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC. 
6BILLION. 
>>  
>> YOU WILL LIKE THIS. 
WE WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE JOB KILLING INCOME 
KILLING, PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. 
>>  THAT WAS 
COSTING OUR COUNTRY -- AND WE 
HAVE THE CLEANEST AIR NOW IN 
THE WORLD -- WE HAVE THE 
CLEANEST WATER -- REMEMBER THIS,
I'M AN ENVIRONMENTALIST, I WANT 
CRYSTAL CLEAN WATER. 
I WANT CRYSTAL CLEAN AIR. 
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. 
BUT I ALSO WANT JOBS TO COME TO 
OUR COUNTRY. 
SO THAT WAS GOOD. 
WE SECURED A RECORD -- LISTEN 
TO THIS -- WE CONFIRMED MORE 
COURT JUDGES -- THINK OF THIS 
-- THAN ANYBODY. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET -- WE 
JUST GOT NEIL GORSUCH, I TOLD 
YOU -- WE'RE GOING TO GET 
BRETT, WE'VE GOT GREAT PEOPLE 
-- LOOK AT THIS -- WE MOVED THE 
U.S. EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. 
>> 
>> WE ARE PROTECTING -- 
REMEMBER THIS -- THEY SAID 
YOU'LL NEVER GET THAT. 
THEY'VE SAID THAT ABOUT 
EVERYTHING -- YOU'LL NEVER GET 
THAT, YOU'LL NEVER GET ELECTED, 
NEVER THIS -- LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN, THE WINNER IS DONALD 
TRUMP. 
WELL, -- 
>> 
>> REMEMBER THE TEARS? 
CRIED, CRYING, OH. 
CRYING. 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE NEXT 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
THIS IS ON TELEVISION. 
AND I SAY, DON'T CRY, PLEASE, I 
WANT TO BE HAPPY. 
DON'T CRY. 
NOW THEY ARE CRYING MORE THAN 
EVER. 
EXCEPT YOU KNOW THEY ARE TORN. 
NUMBER 1, THEY ARE CRYING BUT 
THEY'RE MAKING MORE MONEY THAN 
THEY EVER MADE BECAUSE OF US. 
BECAUSE THEIR STOCKS ARE UP, 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN WITH THESE? 
I TELL THEM, ABOUT SIX MONTHS 
AFTER WE START, SIX MONTHS 
BEFORE THE ELECTION, THEY'RE 
GOING TO ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP 
FOR PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW WHY? 
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T, THOSE 
BROADCASTING COMPANIES, "THE 
NEW YORK TIMES," ALL OF THOSE, 
THEY ARE GOING BANKRUPT SO 
FAST. 
SO THEY'LL BE ENDORSING US. 
THEY'LL BE ENDORSING US. 
SO I COULD GO ON FOR PAGE AFTER 
PAGE AFTER PAGE, LOOK AT THAT. 
PAGE AFTER PAGE. 
TO ME, A BIG THING, WE ARE 
RENEGOTIATING THE WORST TRADE 
DEALS EVER MADE BY ANY COUNTRY 
AT ANY TIME. 
SO DEMOCRATS -- I HAD TO BRING 
THAT OUT -- JUST BOOM, BOOM, 
WHY NOT? 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO GIVE WELFARE 
AND FREE HEALTHCARE TO ILLEGAL 
ALIENS COULD FUNDED BY THE 
AMERICAN TAXPAYER. 
>> 
>> HOW ABOUT THIS CLOWN IN 
CALIFORNIA WHO IS RUNNING FOR 
GOVERNOR? 
JUST THINK, YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE FROM CALIFORNIA THAT 
MOVED HERE. 
BUT HOW ABOUT THIS GUY? 
HE ANNOUNCES HE WANTS OPEN 
BORDERS. 
THAT MEANS JUST POUR IN. 
AND HE WANTS TO GIVE THEM 
HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION, 
EVERYTHING. 
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN? 
CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO HAVE A 
BILLION PEOPLE WITHIN A VERY 
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 
NOW, I THINK, SOMEBODY HAS TO 
ASK, WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR 
THIS? 
AND DID YOU KNOW HOW BAD IT'S 
GOING TO BE? 
YOU TALK ABOUT WAITING ONLINE 
FOR THE VETS WHICH WE SAW? 
YOU'LL BE WAITING ONLINE FOR 10 
YEARS. 
IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE 
EVER HEARD. 
OPEN BORDERS! 
COME ON INTO CALIFORNIA, ALL 
OVER THE WORLD THEY ARE GOING 
TO BE POURING INTO CALIFORNIA. 
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT THE 
SAFETY NET FOR THE TRULY NEEDY 
AMERICANS, PEOPLE THAT NEED 
HELP, NOT FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS 
THAT COME IN TO OUR COUNTRY 
ILLEGALLY. 
AND WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH 
INSURANCE, DONALD TRUMP AND 
REPUBLICANS WILL PROTECT 
PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING 
CONDITIONS. 
WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT. 
WE WANT TO DO THAT. 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO DESTROY 
MEDICARE WITH SO-CALLED 
MEDICARE FOR ALL, IT'S GOING TO 
BE BUSSED BEFORE IT EVEN GETS 
OPEN, ROBBING FROM OUR SENIOR 
CITIZENS -- YOU KNOW THAT -- 
IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE 
GREAT CATASTROPHES EVER -- THE 
BENEFITS THEY PAID FOR THEIR 
ENTIRE LIVES, THEY'RE GOING TO 
BE TAKEN AWAY, REPUBLICANS WANT 
TO PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR 
GREAT SENIORS WHO HAVE EARNED 
IT AND THEY HAVE PAID FOR IT 
FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIFE. 
THEY PAID FOR IT. 
THE DEMOCRAT HEALTH CARE PLAN 
WOULD FORCE EVERY AMERICAN ONTO 
GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTHCARE AND 
VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE ALL PRIVATE 
AND EMPLOYER-BASED HEALTHCARE 
PLANS. 
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE GOING TO 
HAVE REALLY BAD HEALTHCARE 
THAT'S GOING TO COST A LOT OF 
MONEY. 
THEIR PLAN WOULD COST $32 
TRILLION AND REQUIRE AT LEAST A 
DOUBLING OF YOUR FEDERAL INCOME 
TAXES, AND PROBABLY
MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. 
>> 
>> THE DEMOCRATS WOULD BANKRUPT 
THE SAFETY NET THROUGH TOTALLY 
UNLIMITED AND UNCONTROLLED 
IMMIGRATION. 
YOU WILL SEE CRIME LIKE YOU'VE 
NEVER EVER SEEN BEFORE. 
THE POLICIES OF THEIR PARTY ARE 
NOT JUST EXTREME, FRANKLY, THEY 
ARE DANGEROUS AND THEY ARE 
CRAZY. 
SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO, 
REMEMBER DANNY AT DEAN AND 
THESE PEOPLE -- YOU'RE GOING TO 
GO OUT AND VOTE BECAUSE WE ARE 
GOING TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY AND 
WE'RE ALMOST THERE, REMEMBER, 
IT'S MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
BUT VERY SHORTLY, WE ARE GOING 
TO BE CHANGING THAT LOGO, TO 
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 
>> 
>> KEEP AMERICA -- AND WE'RE 
GOING TO LOWER TAXES. 
>>  USA! 
USA! 
>> WE'RE GOING TO LOWER TAXES, 
THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES, 
THEY WANT TO DOUBLE AND TRIPLE 
YOUR TAXES, AND WE ARE GOING TO 
SAVE AND WE ARE GOING TO CHERISH
I.C.E. 
I.C.E. 
>> 
>> DEMOCRATS WANT TO OPEN 
BORDERS, WHICH EQUALS MASSIVE 
CRIME COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. 
REPUBLICANS WANT STRONG BORDERS 
AND WE WANT NO CRIME. 
SO HERE IT IS. 
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY
STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY 
RICHER AND WEALTHIER AND SO -- 
YOU NEED THAT. 
LOOK AT HOW WELL WE'RE DOING. 
WE ARE NOT EVER GOING TO 
APOLOGIZE TO OTHER COUNTRIES. 
FOR OUR GREAT SUCCESS OR FOR 
OUR GREAT COUNTRY. 
YOU NOW HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS 
STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR 
VALUES, WE ARE STANDING UP FOR 
NEVADA, AND WE ARE STANDING UP 
FOR OUR GREAT
NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
>> 
>> SO WE ARE GOING TO DO THINGS 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN 
SAYING. 
WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING 
AGAIN, WE ARE WINNING NOW MUCH 
BIGGER THAN I EVER THOUGHT AT A 
MUCH EARLIER LEVEL. 
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS WAS 
GOING TO HAPPEN? 
WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO 
HAPPEN BUT NOT THIS FAST. 
REMEMBER THIS. 
ALL DURING OUR CAMPAIGN, I SAID 
WE'RE GOING, GOING TO START 
WINNING AGAIN. 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR 
REPRESENTATIVES, DEAN HELLER, 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO HIM. 
WE LOVE THIS, DON'T WE? 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, DEAN, 
PLEASE SEE THE PRESIDENT. 
NEVADA IS WINNING TOO MUCH, WE 
CAN'T STAND IT. 
WE JUST CAN'T TAKE IT. 
AND DEAN IS GOING TO COME TO 
THE OVAL OFFICE AND HE'S GOING 
TO SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE, 
SIR, STOP WINNING SO MUCH, THE 
PEOPLE OF NEVADA CAN'T TAKE IT 
ANY LONGER. 
AND WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY? 
I'M GOING TO SAY, SORRY, DEAN, 
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT GOING, 
LOOK, HERE'S THE STORY. 
WE REALLY HAVE TURNED IT 
AROUND. 
WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN AS A 
COUNTRY. 
EVERY TIME A PERSON COMES INTO 
THE OVAL OFFICE, A PRESIDENT, A 
KING, A QUEEN, A PRIME 
MINISTER, THEY SAY,
MR. PRESIDENT, CONGRATULATIONS 
ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THIS 
COUNTRY. 
IT'S TRUE. 
WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE 
IT. 
ALL THE TIME, I MEAN, I MEAN 
ALL THE TIME -- ALMOST -- I 
HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT -- 
OTHERWISE THEY'LL GET --
ALMOST ALL THE TIME. 
THEY SAY CONGRATULATIONS. 
SOME OF THEM ARE SAYING THAT 
THEY ARE EMULATING US, BUT MOST 
IMPORTANTLY AGAIN, WE ARE 
RESPECTED. 
WE ARE REALLY RESPECTED. 
FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING. 
AND IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE 
OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN RESPECTED. 
BUT WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN. 
>>  USA! 
USA! 
>> SO I LOVE THIS STATE. 
I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF THIS 
STATE. 
I WAS HERE A LOT. 
I WAS HERE A LOT. 
I WAS HERE A LOT BEFORE I DID 
THIS POLITICAL THING. 
BY THE WAY, HOW DID THAT WORK 
OUT? 
THAT WORKED OUT OKAY. 
BUT, PLEASE, REMEMBER IT COULD 
BE VERY FRAGILE. 
IF YOU HAVE THE WRONG PEOPLE IN 
WASHINGTON, D.C. IT COULD ALL 
END VERY QUICKLY, BAD THINGS CAN
HAPPEN TO THE ECONOMY, VERY 
QUICKLY. 
IT DOESN'T TAKE MANY BAD 
DECISIONS AND THEY WILL MAKE 
ALL BAD DECISIONS, WE CAN'T LET 
IT HAPPEN. 
SO I GIVE YOU A PLEDGE. 
WE ARE GOING TO WORK HARDER 
THAN EVER BEFORE. 
WE ARE GOING TO WORK SMARTER 
THAN EVER BEFORE. 
WE ARE GOING TO DO THINGS THAT 
NOBODY THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. 
AND THAT'S ALREADY STARTED. 
SO GO OUT, AND VOTE, YOU ARE 
NOT LETTING ME DOWN, I'M NEVER, 
EVER GOING TO LET YOU DOWN. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
WE'LL BE BACK VERY SOON. 
VOTE FOR DANNY, VOTE FOR DEAN, 
VOTE FOR ALL OF THEM. 
WE NEED REPUBLICANS IN 
WASHINGTON, WE ARE GOING TO 
KEEP IT, WHETHER IT'S FROM LAS 
VEGAS TO RENO, TO CARSON CITY, 
WE NEED EVERY NEVADA PATRIOT TO 
GO OUT AND VOTE. 
GO OUT AND VOTE. 
WE WILL KEEP IT GOING, THANK
