challenge is going to be a robbery okay
so coming out the pool then girls and I
say what to do

is obviously it's a ring don't you ain't
got to try and jump through the hole
without touching it and whoever black
does that the best like a smoother so
yeah that's right some of the smoothest
nice showed me the position of your body
when you're gonna be going through so
mum is bomb the referee she's gonna
judge on your two jumps okay so to your
New York first yeah right then
let's see you're a bit close to the edge
of the pool mom I think we need to go
into the pool a bit okay great so what
somehow you're up three two one
