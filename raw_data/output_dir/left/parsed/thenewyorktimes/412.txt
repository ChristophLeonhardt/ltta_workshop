These driverless electric cars
are in Masdar, a city built on
the outskirts of Abu Dhabi that prohibits
the use of combustion engine vehicles.
Ten years ago, the United Arab 
Emirates announced that
it would be the world's first city
with a net zero carbon footprint.
With an initial budget of 
around $20 billion,
Masdar was built with traditional 
terra-cotta designs and
high enough to capture the desert breeze.
Solar panels were supposed to
generate most of its energy supply,
but the plans for this oasis 
have been derailed due in part
to the 2008 global economic recession.
The completion date has been 
pushed from 2016 to 2030.
It was supposed to house 40,000
people, but today there are less
than 300 who call it home, 
most of them students.
Masdar’s development is continuing, 
but its planners have given up
on the original goal 
of being a carbon neutral city
and are settling instead for 
being what they say is “low carbon.”
