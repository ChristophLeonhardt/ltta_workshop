hey happy wacky tabacky day everyone Justin Trudeau's dream of turning Canada into a stoners paradise has arrived potheads rejoice but for the rest of us here are three sobering reasons why cannabis legalization in Canada is going to be less of a panacea and more of a problem in the months ahead everything you got there can hurt you can't it sure kid why do you think they call it dope oh happy happy joy joy its October 17th so feel free to light up a fatty and celebrate Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's latest dubious achievement but before you get to blitz consider the downside of legalized marijuana number one lack of roadside testing you know we're supposed to be getting tough on impaired driving and now law enforcement has to deal with this you know in July the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police said that it's unlikely to reach its goal of having 2,000 officers trained to spot drug impaired drivers as of today as well setting the groundwork for compliance will mean a price tag in the hundreds of millions of dollars oh well I guess the feds will just have to raise taxes I suppose by the way there is this feeling that legalizing pot will both end the black-market and be a cash cow for government whoever believes this must be smoking some really nasty stuff writing in the sun mark bono Kowski notes there is expected to be a whopping 400% shortfall of legal supply in year one of legalization do you think users will simply go without or will they turn to that guy in the park with all those little baggies besides it looks like buying recreational pot in the legal channel could be three times more expensive than the black market stuff so much like contraband tobacco that sourced at a fraction of the cost from native reserves there will surely be a vibrant market for illegal cannabis based on the bottom line - but back to the road safety issue my prediction given that most law enforcement agencies lack the necessary equipment for roadside testing well just expect to see more turmoil on the roads as users drive hi something we're all going to end up paying for with increased insurance call not to mention the human cost of lost lives the second reason legalized pot is bad the olfactory factor which is to say why must the stench of weed so resemble the scent of this creature this muffin is shifu's in many ways attention cannabis users your joints stink your clothes stink and you stink I'm all for personal freedom but you're right to wave your fist in the air ends at the precise moment it connects with my face so who those are the bat for the majority of society you know those who don't want to smell or ingest your secondhand smoke a scent that resembles the aromatic sensation of a dead skunk entombed in a plug toilet but I guess that's our problem now isn't it as society must accommodate your addiction finally the third reason legalization could prove hellacious when it comes to so-called reasonable accommodation how soon will it be before the system is gamed by marijuana activists you're trying to say that entitlements I'm not entitled to my entitlement indeed remember the human rights Fiasco that was Steve Gibson versus Gator ted's here's the synopsis Steve Gibson was a regular at Gator ted's restaurant in Burlington Ontario and he claimed he was discriminated against when the restaurants owner Ted kendos asked him not to smoke marijuana outside the establishments front door this was due to numerous customer complaints and the fact that allowing this activity to occur on the premises would likely result in the alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario revoking gator Ted's liquor license which of course would put Gator Ted's out of business incredibly in a saga of dueling bureaucracies the interior Human Rights Tribunal stated that its rules actually Trump those of the AGCO and that to them it was apparently more important for mr. Gibson the freely smoked his medical marijuana for soft tissue injuries of course than it was for Gator ted's - oh I don't know remain in business Ted Pindos fought the Human Rights hucksters for 10 long years and after doling out some $80,000 in legal fees an adjudicator for the Tribunal reversed the decision translation the Human Rights Tribunal would no longer force Gator ted's to break provincial law to accommodate the law breaking Gibson but here's the rub this sordid saga was settled in 2013 a full five years before today's marijuana legalization now that this substance is legal how soon will it be before part activists and people driven by utter selfishness like the Steve Gibson's of this world push the envelope in terms of reasonable accommodation bottom line this whole process of legalizing cannabis something that goes back three years ago when Justin Trudeau seemingly made this promise on the spur of the moment while on the campaign trail clearly hasn't been thought through properly rather it was ostensibly done to make Justin look hip with the kids and to virtual signal to all the squares out there that Justin is right and we're all wrong in other words the legalization of pot is yet another picture perfect Justin Trudeau cock-up right up there with his mr. dressup dance routine in India and cutting multi-million dollar compensation checks to his lavish terrorists well played yet again mr. Prime Minister 2019 just can't come soon enough for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has to do a please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
