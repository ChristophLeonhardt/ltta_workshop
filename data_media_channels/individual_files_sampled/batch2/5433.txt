thing one tonight one of the most striking revelations from the Comey memos is president Trump's apparent fixation on the most salacious part of the steel dossier you know what I'm talking about explaining why what he called the golden showers thing could not have happened good Nevadan Comey writes in his January 2017 memo Trump said he had spoken to people who had been on the Miss Universe trip with him and they had reminded him that he didn't stay overnight in Russia for that he said he arrived in the morning did events then showered and dressed to the pageant at the hotel he didn't say the hotel name and left of the pageant afterwards he returned only to get his things because they departed for New York by playing that same night now Trump apparently brought it up for the second time just a month later according to Comey explaining as he did it or dinner he hadn't stayed overnight in Russian during the Miss Universe trip so the quote golden showers thing couldn't possibly be true because Trump says he didn't even stay overnight in Moscow except that's not what the flight records say and that's thing too in 60 seconds so the president allegedly told James call me multiple times that the quote golden shower thing could not possibly be true saying the proof was that he didn't even stay overnight in Moscow according however to flight records obtained by Bloomberg Trump departed from Asheville North Carolina arriving in Moscow early Friday morning 6:00 a.m. on November 8th and then Trump stayed in Russia until Sunday November 10th for nearly forty six hours flying out of Moscow in looey hours Sunday morning back from New York City area so we know Trump spent Friday night there in Moscow and we also know most of his schedule Trump went to eat Friday night with Russian business tycoons at Nobu you see that picture there then he attended a birthday party for the pageant's host developer R Us angle R of what happened after the birthday party is a mystery the only thing we know about the night that Trump slept in Moscow come from his bodyguard Keith Schiller when he reportedly told Congress he turned down an offer from a Russian to send women to Trump's room Schiller testified he stood outside Trump's hotel for a time and then went to bed the next time Trump is seen publicly is the next day before the Miss Universe pageant on Saturday Trump sat down for an interview with NBC looking a little bleary-eyed do you have a relationship with Vladimir Putin a conversational relationship or anything that you feel you have sway or influence over his government I do have a relationship and I can tell you that he's very interested in what we're doing here today hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
