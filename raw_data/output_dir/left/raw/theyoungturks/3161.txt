EXCELLENT
SUBJECT MATTER THIS WEEK AND IN

00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,780
THIS VIDEO YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE,

00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,849
PRALJAK, A 72-YEAR-OLD WHO HAD
BEEN PREVIOUSLY GIVEN A LENGTHY

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:21,140
TERM, WANTED TO APPEAL THAT AND
CAME BACK INTO COURT TO FIND OUT

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,900
ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
TO HIM AND THEN THIS HAPPENED.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,160
I AM REJECTING THE COURT
RULING.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,159
STOP,

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,160
PLEASE.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:43,160
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,200
I HAVE TAKEN POISON.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,440
MR.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:01:02,130
PRESIDENT, OUR CLIENT SAYS
HE HAS TAKEN POISON.

15
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,140
WE SUSPEND, PLEASE THE
CURTAINS.

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,370
YOU SEE THE JUDGE
COMPLETELY DUMBSTRUCK ABOUT

17
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,820
WHAT TO DO IN THAT SITUATION.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,650
HE DRANK A VIOLET POISON, SAID I
HAVE TAKEN POISON AND THEN

19
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,420
LATER DIED IN THE HOSPITAL FROM
THE POISON HE INGESTED.

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,390
SO HE HAD RECEIVED A 20 YEAR
JAIL SENTENCE FOR BEING A WAR

21
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,020
CRIMINAL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE
IS.

22
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,500
BACK DURING THE BOSNIAN WAR OF
92 TO 95, IN THE BEGINNING

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,870
THE BOSNIAN CROATS AND MUSLIMS
WERE FIGHTING AGAINST THE SERBS.

24
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,590
THEY HAD COMMITTED
ATROCITIES, SOME OF WHICH WERE

25
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,280
DEEMED A GENOCIDE

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,130
AND IN 2013, HIS FORCES
COMMITTED ATROCITIES AND HE DID

27
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,310
NOT STOP THEM AND HE WAS
SENTENCED FOR CRIMES THAT

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:00,390
HAPPENED IN THE CITY OF MOSTAR
AND NONETHELESS WHEN HE WAS

29
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,260
SENTENCED, HE TOOK POISON AND
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE A WAR

30
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,810
CRIMINAL, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
AN UN-LIBERAL THING OF ME

31
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,119
BUT I DON'T CARE.

32
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,520
I THINK IT WAS THE GUY DURING
THE NUREMBERG TRIALS WHO

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,060
TOOK POISON AND PEOPLE SAID IT
WAS A SHAME.

34
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,630
WHY, WE WERE GOING TO HANG HIM
ANYWAY?

35
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,670
I GUESS IT WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER
IF WE WOULD'VE HUNG THEM, BUT HE

36
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,050
WAS A WAR CRIMINAL, HE WAS
ADJUDICATED AS SUCH AND THEN

37
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,480
DIED, BUT THE CROATIAN PRIME
MINISTER, PLENKOVIC

38
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,050
SAID THAT IT WAS A
DEEP MORAL INJUSTICE TO THE

39
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,680
CROATIAN PEOPLE BECAUSE NO
MATTER WHAT, PEOPLE DEFEND

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,050
THEIR OWN SO IN THAT CASE
MUSLIMS WERE BUTCHERED AND

41
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,569
THEY'RE LIKE YEAH, BUT THEY ARE
NOT CROATS SO WHO CARES?

42
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,820
AND NOT EVERYBODY DOES IT, THANK
GOD FOR THAT BUT THE ONES WHO DO

43
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,739
DO IT, OF COURSE THE OTTOMAN
GOVERNMENT AND THEN HEY,

44
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:07,230
WHERE DID ALL THE ARMENIANS GO,
DON'T CARE.

45
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,670
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ADMIT IT
AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

46
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,890
TALK ABOUT THE GENOCIDE AND THEY
ARE GOING TO PROTECT THEIR OWN.

47
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,090
NOW THE CROATS, WHEN THE MUSLIMS
ARE BUTCHERED AND HE KEEPS

48
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,610
GOING AROUND AND AROUND AND
AROUND.

49
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,750
SO WHEN THIS GUY TAKES THE
POISON AND ENDS HIS LIFE, IT

50
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,450
IS A DRAMATIC MOMENT, BUT WHEN I
CERTAINLY DON'T SHED A TEAR FOR.

51
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,190
YOU COULD SAY THE LIBERAL
POSITION IS PRO-EUTHANASIA.

52
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,630
IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO TAKE THEIR
OWN LIFE THEY CAN AND I

53
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,630
GUESS HE DID THAT.

54
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,930
HE GAVE HIMSELF THE DEATH
SENTENCE THERE BUT AS YOU

55
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,950
SAID, IN THIS PERSON YOU SEE A
MICROCOSM OF THIS INABILITY

56
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,330
TO FACE WHAT YOU'VE DONE, THE
BELIEF THAT EITHER WE

57
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,349
SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT, OR
IF IT WAS DONE FOR YOUR

58
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,190
COMMUNITY, DURING A TIME OF WAR,
IS IT REALLY A CRIME ANYWAY?

59
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,000
WHERE PEOPLE BEING PC IN THIS
WAY WHEN IT COMES TO WAR CRIMES?

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,160
I'M SORRY, IT IS ALL ACROSS
THE WORLD.

61
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,140
COLUMBUS DOES AND FOR WHATEVER
INSANE REASON, ITALIAN AMERICANS

62
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,640
HAVE LATCHED ONTO CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS.

63
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
I GET IT WITH

64
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:11,010
THE TRADITION OR WHATEVER DIE HE
WIPES OUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

65
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,750
ALMOST THE DEFINITION OF A
GENOCIDE.

66
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,900
NO, COLUMBUS IS GREAT.

67
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,180
ANDREW JACKSON, TRAIL OF TEARS,
MARCHES NATIVE

68
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,189
AMERICANS, THEY DIE IN THIS
RELOCATION.

69
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:23,270
NO, ANDREW JACKSON IS ONE OF US.

70
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,270
HEÃ­S AWESOME.

71
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,530
SO DONALD TRUMP, AND
COMMEMORATING NATIVE

72
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,809
AMERICANS WHO SERVED IN
WORLD WAR II AND WERE

73
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:32,270
INSTRUMENTAL IN DEFEATING THE
NON-SEAS, DOES IN FRONT OF

74
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,379
AN INJURED JACKSON PICTURE
BECAUSE NO, HE'S OUR START

75
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,099
AND THE TURKEYS PRESENT-DAY
TURKISH GOVERNMENT.

76
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:42,610
THE ARMENIANS WERE MARCHED OUT,
WHY?

77
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,830
DID THEY DECIDE UP AND LEAVE?

78
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,569
NO, THEY WERE MARCHED OUT
BECAUSE THE TURKISH

79
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,722
GOVERNMENT, OR THE OTTOMAN
GOVERNMENT AT THE TIME HAD

80
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:55,300
A BARE MINIMUM ALLOWED IT, MADE
A HABIT, ETC.

81
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,110
DID THEY JUST DECIDE TO LEAVE
THEIR HOMES?

82
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,270
NO, IT'S BECAUSE WERE TURKISH,
WE HAVE TO DEFEND IT AND

83
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,849
NOT ADMITTED THAT THEY'RE NOT
THERE ANYMORE.

84
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:06,379
AND YES, A LOT OF THEM DIED.

85
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:10,610
YES A LOT OF THEM DIED AND SO
BUT NO, IF YOU'RE TURKISH

86
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,349
YOU DEFEND THE TURKS, IF YOU'RE
CROAT YOU DEFEND THE CROATS

87
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:15,759
AND ON AND ON IT GOES.

88
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,580
HERE IN AMERICA WE HAVE
PEOPLE WHO DO THIS DAY TRY

89
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,210
TO SAY SLAVERY?

90
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,889
NOT AS BAD AS YOU LIBERALS TRY
TO MAKE IT OUT TO BE.

91
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,470
POSSIBLY THE DARKEST STAIN ON
OUR COUNTRY'S PAST, THEY

92
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,059
TRY TO SPEND AS BEING AN OKAY
THING.

93
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:32,309
THERE WERE PEOPLE EARLIER THIS
YEAR DEFENDING THE JAPANESE

94
00:05:32,309 --> 00:05:33,610
CONCENTRATION KIND CAMPS.

95
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,340
PEOPLE WHO DEFEND THE BOMBING OF
HOW TO SURE NOT TO SAKE.

96
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,849
WE HAVE OUR OWN THINGS AND WE
HAVE HUGE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR

97
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:43,270
POPULATION WHO REFUSE TO
ADMIT THAT OUR HISTORY IS

98
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:49,430
LITTERED WITH TERRIBLE ACTS OF
THAT NATURE.

99
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,120
AND BILL O'REILLY SAYING, MAYBE
SLAVES BUT THE WHITE HOUSE,

100
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,430
BUT THEY WERE LUCKY BECAUSE THEY
GOT FOOD AND CLOTHING.

101
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,509
YEAH THE SLAVES WERE SO LUCKY.

102
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,830
AS LONG AS IT IS YOUR GUYS DOING
IT, IT IS ALWAYS OKAY, BUT

103
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,809
IT IS NOT OKAY.

104
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:09,419
I WISH WE WOULD IDENTIFY AS
FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS RATHER

105
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,669
THAN WHATEVER PARTICULAR TRIBE
THAT YOU HAPPEN TO COME FROM.

106
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,119
THE ACTIONS OF PROJECT IN THE
FIRST PLACE WERE DESPICABLE.

107
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:21,250
I'M GLAD HE WAS CONVICTED AS A
WAR CRIMINAL THAT HE IS.

108
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,379
THE ACTIONS OF THE CROATIAN
PRIME MINISTER STILL

109
00:06:23,379 --> 00:00:00,000
DEFENDING INTO THEY ARE
ABHORRENT.
