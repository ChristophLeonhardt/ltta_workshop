00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
hi guys so this week the cute one left

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,100
one direction and some people are real

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,319
upset about it but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I even</font>

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,660
mad at<font color="#E5E5E5"> you because let me tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,780
thing back in like 2001 I had a notebook

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,660
and in that notebook I wrote out

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,600
detailed synopses of every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,660
episode of Lizzie McGuire I'd get on

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,600
Disney Channel calm with my dial-up

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,920
modem and wait like 45 minutes for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,810
pictures of Hilary Duff's face to load

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,420
so that I could print them out and tape

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,640
them inside notebook one particular

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Friday afternoon I was just chilling at</font>

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,079
my after-school program waiting for my

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,940
dad to pick me up he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to hit</font>

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,579
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> up like say around four thirty four</font>

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,129
thirty two hits and I start to get

19
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">really nervous for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forty I'm like pacing</font>

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,430
around just willing with my entire soul

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,820
that any second my dad will turn the

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,590
corner and pull up to my after school

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,539
but the timing picks me up at like five

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,840
o'clock I am doubled over in tears

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,080
because I'm missing the latest<font color="#CCCCCC"> episode</font>

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,619
of lizzie mcguire like dude we've all

27
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:11,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">been obsessed with something and</font>

28
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,460
probably something far more trivial than

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,439
a boy band but he or she who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is without</font>

30
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,930
fandom cast the first stone<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

31
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,430
like if you didn't have something that

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,990
you were passionately obsessed with in

33
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,909
school<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a hug because</font>

34
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,890
you missed out buddy when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in high</font>

35
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,229
school it was the emo band Fall Out Boy

36
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,470
I wrote there lyrics around the edges of

37
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,750
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> page in my day planner and</font>

38
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,280
when I got home from school<font color="#CCCCCC"> and went on</font>

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,619
their message board and I was probably

40
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,380
so annoying but it was also exactly what

41
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,060
I needed at the time and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

42
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,560
we've all<font color="#E5E5E5"> grown up I still have friends</font>

43
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,780
from that message board like close ones

44
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,329
like one of them was a bridesmaid in my

45
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,970
wedding it is a new and blessed<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ariel</font>

46
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,799
now I'm too old and too embarrassed to

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,060
tell you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I get</font>

48
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,250
obsessed with now but trust me they're

49
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,140
still there<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe tone down a few</font>

50
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,420
notches but definitely still there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,549
if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be straight up openly</font>

52
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,640
and delightfully obsessed with something

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,380
and just to enjoy it without getting

54
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,220
ashamed of it you go my friend because

55
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,750
that's probably the better way to live

56
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,220
so now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to tell me in comments</font>

57
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,410
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you have either</font>

58
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,790
been obsessed with when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were younger</font>

59
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,069
or that you just love now and that you

60
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,959
refuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be ashamed about if you like</font>
