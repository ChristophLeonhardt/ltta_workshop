1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,956
TOOLS TO HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH.

2
00:00:02,956 --> 00:00:04,190
>> Neil: THANKS, PAM.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,758
GOOD CATCHING UP WITH YOU.

4
00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:07,260
>> THANK YOU.

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,262
YOU TOO, NEIL.

6
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:11,131
>> Neil: NOT ONLY ISRAEL BUT

7
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:13,099
WE'VE BEEN TIGHTENING PROTECTION

8
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:14,534
AND SECURITIES THROUGHOUT THE

9
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:16,669
REGION HERE.

10
00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:17,871
EXPECTATIONS ARE MORE VIOLENT OR

11
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:19,572
INSTABILITY IN THE DAYS, WEEKS,

12
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:22,976
SOME SAY THE MONTHS AHEAD.

13
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:31,050
ISRAELI SPECIAL FORCES, AARON

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:31,417
COHN.

15
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:32,719
GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK.

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,021
IT'S A SENSE THAT THERE'S GOING

17
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:36,890
TO BE MORE VIOLENCE BUT WE HAVE

18
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,825
TO BE COGNIZANT OF PROTECTING

19
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:41,794
OUR EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM BUT

20
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:44,230
ELSEWHERE, LOCATIONS ELSE WHERE

21
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,865
THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST.

22
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:49,068
>> YEAH, NEIL.

23
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:51,070
I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME.

24
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,239
LISTEN, ISRAEL HAS ALWAYS BEEN A

25
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,108
FAIRLY GOOD COUNTRY AND A TOUGH

26
00:00:55,108 --> 00:00:56,943
NEIGHBORHOOD AND SECURITY NOT

27
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:58,311
ONLY HAS BEEN THE UTMOST CONCERN

28
00:00:58,311 --> 00:01:00,780
FOR ISRAELI CIVILIANS THE LAST

29
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,416
60 YEARS BUT OBVIOUSLY FOR OUR

30
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:03,950
EMBASSIES AS WELL.

31
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,652
AS FAR AS PROTECTIONS, WE HAVE

32
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:08,154
THE U.S. MARINES TASKED WITH

33
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:10,790
PROTECTING U.S. EMBASSIES

34
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,124
ABROAD.

35
00:01:11,124 --> 00:01:12,992
WITH THE EMBASSY MOVING TO

36
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:13,760
JERUSALEM, IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,428
ME IF THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND

38
00:01:15,428 --> 00:01:17,530
THE U.S. MARINE CORPS HAS

39
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,932
BOLSTERED THE ACTUAL MANPOWER AT

40
00:01:18,932 --> 00:01:21,234
THAT EMBASSY.

41
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:23,102
THEY WEREN'T VERY CLOSE TO THE

42
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:24,938
ISRAELI SECRET SERVICES IN

43
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:25,271
ISRAEL.

44
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:28,474
THEY'VE HAD A REALLY STRONG

45
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:30,610
RELATIONSHIP OVER THE PAST

46
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:30,944
DECADE.

47
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:32,779
BUT FROM WHAT I'M HEARING,

48
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:34,380
THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE AND

49
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,982
IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO

50
00:01:35,982 --> 00:01:38,351
STAY INCREASED UNTIL ALL OF THE

51
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:41,421
HYPE OF THIS MOVE FINALLY DOES

52
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:42,989
KIND OF RUN ITS CORES.

53
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:45,458
THERE'S MANPOWER WITH THE NEW

54
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:45,792
EMBASSY.

55
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:48,628
THE MOVE IS BEING FINALIZED.

56
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:50,797
>> Neil: WHEN YOU LOOK AT

57
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:53,266
PROTECTING FACILITIES, ISRAEL OR

58
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:54,601
ELSEWHERE, ANY TIME THERE'S AN

59
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:56,636
INCIDENT, THE FEAR OF A SPREAD

60
00:01:56,636 --> 00:01:59,239
OF INCIDENTS AND WE BEEF OF

61
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,207
COMPOUNDS AND WE DID IN BENGHAZI

62
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:03,943
RAID THAT KILLED OUR U.S.

63
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:05,845
AMBASSADOR, BUT IT DOESN'T LAST

64
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:06,279
FOREVER.

65
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,680
SECURITY IS BEEFED UP SHORT OF

66
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,717
ANOTHER INCIDENT OCCURRING.

67
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:12,185
IT'S ALL SO SCALED DOWN.

68
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:15,355
WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE SECURITY

69
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:16,489
EXPERTS TO DO?

70
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:18,958
>> WELL, I'M SURE THE ISRAELIS

71
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,261
ARE ADVISING THE U.S. SECURITY

72
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:22,629
FORCES IN THAT PARTICULAR

73
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:22,962
REGION.

74
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:25,531
THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE WE'RE

75
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:27,600
PROVIDING -- ISRAEL IS PROVIDING

76
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,869
AMERICANS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF

77
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:30,870
INTELLIGENCE AND ALWAYS HAS.

78
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,773
WE'VE HAD AN EXCELLENT

79
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:37,010
RELATIONSHIP IN THE U.S. WITH

80
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,910
ISRAEL'S FBI.

81
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,480
IF I WAS ADVISING THE U.S., I

82
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,182
WOULD SAY HEAVIER LEAN ON THE

83
00:02:43,182 --> 00:02:45,018
ISRAELIS IN TERMS OF ACTUAL

84
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:45,418
INFORMATION.

85
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:47,720
SECURITY KIND OF -- IT'S A

86
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,389
LEAVING, BREATHING, ORGANIC

87
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:50,390
SOMETHING THAT GETS STAFFED UP

88
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,692
AS THREATS INCREASE AND CAN BE

89
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:54,227
PEELED BACK OR SCALED DOWN.

90
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:57,897
ISRAEL IS A BIG FAN OF THE PLAIN

91
00:02:57,897 --> 00:02:58,531
CLOTHES SECURITY.

92
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:00,500
SORT OF LOOKING WHERE NO ONE CAN

93
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,503
SEE THAT SECURITY AGENT.

94
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:06,172
SO I WOULD BE BOLSTERING THE

95
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:07,807
PLANE CLOTHES ELEMENT IN AND

96
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:10,877
AROUND THE EMBASSY,

97
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:12,011
MULTILAYERING IT WITH THE WAY

98
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:13,579
THE ISRAELIS DO.

99
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,448
THEY ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS

100
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:18,318
MANPOWER BY SPACING THEM OUT

101
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:18,685
CLEVERLY.

102
00:03:18,685 --> 00:03:20,386
SO I THINK THE PLAIN CLOTHED

103
00:03:20,386 --> 00:03:22,789
APPARATUS COMBINED WITH REALLY

104
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:24,891
GOOD INTEL ABOUT THREATS BEING

105
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:26,592
MADE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET

106
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,927
COMFORTABLE WITH THE NEW AREA IN

107
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:28,294
JERUSALEM.

108
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:30,029
IT'S A DIFFERENT LOCATION NOW.

109
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:31,864
SO GETTING EXTREMELY INTIMATE

110
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:33,499
WITH THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION,

111
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:35,301
THE CROSS STREETS AND JUST

112
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:36,436
PUSHING THE EYES OUT AS FAR AS

113
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:37,904
POSSIBLE AND THE SURVEILLANCE

114
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:39,672
OUT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THE

115
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:41,441
ACTUAL EMBASSY SO YOU CAN SEE AS

116
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,608
FAR OUT AS POSSIBLE.

117
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:44,777
AND THEN AGAIN, MULTILAYERING IT

118
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:45,912
WITH GOOD INTEL.

119
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:47,246
I THINK THE AMERICANS WILL BE IN

120
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:47,814
GOOD HANDS.

121
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:49,148
I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK WE'LL

122
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:53,353
SEE ANYTHING LIKE A BENGHAZI,

123
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:54,320
ESPECIALLY IN JERUSALEM WITH THE

124
00:03:54,320 --> 00:00:00,000
SECURITY COMBINATION THERE.
