1
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,425
It kind of makes me nostalgic

2
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,962
in this building because it's a
look that I

3
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,865
remember very well from the
from the 80s. A lot of people

4
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:36,870
hated it but it really does,
it gives it a liveliness

5
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,240
that the urban environment
might not have had.

6
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,181
After graffiti was no
longer on trains,

7
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:52,452
I think it migrated to
walls and to spaces like

8
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:56,356
this, which were abandoned
spaces, and kids

9
00:00:56,356 --> 00:01:01,027
could come in here and
paint at their leisure.

10
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,935
It would be great to, if
this place is renovated it

11
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:12,505
would be great if this
interior walls were kept as

12
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:17,444
they were rather than
made pristine again

13
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,857
Of course graffiti is an
ephemeral art form so it was

14
00:01:30,857 --> 00:00:00,000
never intended to stay forever.
