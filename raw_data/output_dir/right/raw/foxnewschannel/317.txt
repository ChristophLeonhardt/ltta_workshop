59
00:02:13,604 --> 00:02:16,440
AND I WILL ALWAYS BE A TEAM

60
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:18,008

WE HAVE CHRONICLED ALL OF THIS

86
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:11,862
FOR YOU.

87
00:03:11,863 --> 00:03:13,330
IT IS THE DEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK.

88
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:18,602
WE GET THIS ALL THE TIME.

89
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:20,871
BORK AND THOMAS AND THEY DID IT

90
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:22,272
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND HIS WIFE

91
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:23,406
AND FAMILY.

92
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:24,441
THIS IS ABOUT POWER.

93
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:28,879
THE LEFT WILL STOP AT NOTHING

94
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,548
WHEN IT COMES TO BLOCKING A

95
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:31,948
NOMINATION.

96
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,950
DEMOCRATS OPENLY ACCUSING

CALLING HIM EVIL.

101
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:44,060
COMPARING HIM TO BILL COSBY AND

102
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:46,329
SO MUCH MORE.

103
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,866
WITH ZERO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE

104
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:51,735
AND ZERO CORROBORATING

105
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:52,569
WITNESSES.

106
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,006
BASED ON 4-DECADES OLD CLAIMS

107
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:57,707
WITH HOLES ALL OVER THE PLACE.

108
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,544
THIS KIND OF GUILT BY ACCUSATION

109
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:04,247
WAS PARROTED BY THE SO-CALLED

110
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:07,217
NEWS MEDIA INCLUDING THE

111
00:04:07,218 --> 00:04:09,386
LATE-NIGHT SO-CALLED COMEDIAN

114
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:19,196
OVER THE WEEKEND A WRITER FROM A

00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:21,164
SHOW TWEETED THIS:

116
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:23,867
I AM GLAD WE RUINED BRETT

117
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:25,202
KAVANAUGH'S LIFE.

118
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:27,404
STAND BACK AND THINK HOW UGLY

119
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:32,676
AND DESPICABLE THAT.

120
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:34,544
SHE LATER APOLOGIZED.

121
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:35,312
NOTHING FUNNY.

122
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:38,848
THAT TWEET SUMS UP WHAT WE HAVE

123
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,452
WITNESSED NOW FOR FAR TOO MANY

124
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:44,087
ELECTIONS AND CONFIRMATIONS IN

125
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:44,921
THIS COUNTRY.

126
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:46,489
THAT'S ALL THEY OFFER YOU THE

127
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,627
AMERICAN PEOPLE IN 29 DAYS.

128
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:52,729
THE POLITICS OF PERSONAL

129
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,129
DESTRUCTION.

130
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,297
IT'S OBVIOUS.

131
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:57,300
THEY WANT TO REGAIN POWER AND

132
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:59,836
THEY TRY TO MAKE CONSERVATIVES

133
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:04,641
AS EVIL AS YOU CAN.

134
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:07,978
THEY ARE NOT TAKING THE

135
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:08,778
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION WELL.

136
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,513
THIS IS A SHOCKER.

137
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:12,582
TAKE A LOOK.

138
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,352
>> THIS IS THE

139
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:18,255
INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF

140
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:18,655
TRIBUNALISM.

141
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:20,757
>> PEOPLE ARE SHRIEKING AND

142
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:25,028
SAYING DON'T SEND US BACK TO THE

143
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,463
'50s.

144
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:27,764
BRETT KAVANAUGH SAID YES I CAN.

145
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,599
>> THE PRESIDENT IS FOR LAW AND

146
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,634
ORDER BUT NOT FOR SECRETARY OF

147
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:30,934
STATE.

148
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:37,107
>> THIS IS A CRUSHING DEFEAT FOR

149
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:38,208
WOMEN'S RIGHTS.

150
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,677
>> TRUMP DELIVERED RACISM FOR

151
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:42,245
THESE PEOPLE AND MISOGYNY AND

152
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:44,080
NOW THE SUPREME COURT FOR THESE

153
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,548
PEOPLE.

154
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:49,352
WE WILL SEE IF THIS REIN THEY

155
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:51,454
HAVE CONTROL OVER ALL 3 BRANCHES

156
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:53,323
OF GOVERNMENT IF THIS LASTS FOR

157
00:05:53,324 --> 00:06:01,431
30 DAYS OR 2 YEARS OR 1,000

158
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:01,865
YEARS.

159
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:04,968
>> Sean: SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS

BRETT KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION

172
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:41,705
IS THE ULTIMATE AFFIRMATION OF

173
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:47,944
THE PATRIARCHY.

174
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:48,278

MORE PROSPEROUS.

186
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,781
LOOK AT WHAT DEMOCRATS DO.

187
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:25,915
THEY DIVIDE AMERICANS.

188
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,617
THIS IS WHAT IDENTITY POLITICS

189
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:27,884
