I'm a practicing Roman Catholic a firm
believer in God but living in a nation
whose First Amendment states that there
is to be no national religion it should
the under God in the Pledge be removed
no and there isn't under God in the
Pledge shouldn't be removed is because
it's not establishment of religion
unless the government is forcing you to
say it
