♪ ♪ Laura: AILING JOHN McCAIN IS ONCE AGAIN THE MEDIA'S FAVORITE REPUBLICAN. NOW THAT HE REPORTEDLY DOES NOT WANT PRESIDENT TRUMP AT HIS FUNERAL AND HE ALSO WISHES HE HADN'T PICKED SARAH PALIN AS HIS RUNNING MATE BACK IN 2008. BUT HIS FONDNESS FOR THE MEDIA HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN A TWO-WAY STREET AS THEY ROUTINELY HAVE TRASHED HIM WHEN IT SUITS THEIR OWN PURPOSES. IN A 2006 ARTICLE HEADLINED JOHN McCAIN, THE SELLOUT, THE POST CALLED THE SENATOR A POLITICIAN WHO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO GET ELECTED. McCAIN 'HAS GREAT SIN? AGREEING TO SPEAK AT JERRY FALWELL'S LIBERTY UNIVERSITY. THE ATLANTIC RAN A PIECE DURING THE 2008 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN TITLED McCAIN, THE SELLOUT. BASED ON A FEAR THAT THE CANDIDATE MIGHT GOVERN AS A CONSERVATIVE. AND IN A 2010 "VANITY FAIR" PIECE HEADLINED THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS, McCAIN IS CALLED SO DESPERATE TO KEEP HIS SENTENCE'S DESPERATE TO KEEP HIS SENTENCE'N DESPERATE TO KEEP HIS SENTENCE'T DESPERATE TO KEEP HIS SENTENCE'E SEAT THAT HE REPUDIATED HIS RECORD, HIS PRINCIPLES AND EVEN HIS MAVERICK REPETITION. ENTRENCHING HIMSELF AS THE ANTI-OBAMA. HERE TO TALK ABOUT McCAIN, A P.O.W. WITH HIM DURING THE VIETNAM WAR. A P.O.W. FOR SIX YEARS AND ALSO MY COLLEAGUE IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION. AND FRANK, ESTEEMED POLLSTER. HE'S GOING TO SHOW HOW THE MEDIA HAVE USED McCAIN OVER THE YEARS TO FIT WHATEVER NARRATIVE THEY FIND CONVENIENT AT THE MOMENT. IT'S GREAT TO SEE BOTH OF YOU. JIM, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU FIRST. FIRST OF ALL, GREAT TO SEE YOU. I WAS YOUNG, YOU WERE EVEN MORE HANDSOME BACK THEN BACK IN 1987, SHARING OFFICE TOGETHER. THAT'S BEFORE I TOOK ON THE APPEARANCE OF A HOMELESS MAN. Laura: IT'S ALL COOL HERE. YOU BETTER THAN ANYONE KNOW THE EXPERIENCE THAT JOHN McCAIN HAD IN VIETNAM. YOU'VE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM FOR A WHILE. DOES IT SURPRISE YOU THAT HE AT THE END DECIDED IT WAS GOING TO MAKE HIS FUNERAL PLANS AND MAKE IT EXPLICIT THAT TRUMP WAS NOT TO BE THERE? YES IT DOES. I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR ADVANCED THIS CANCER IS, BUT I KNOW THAT I WAS TOLD THAT IT IS VERY AGGRESSIVE. TO SAY THAT THINGS LIKE HE DID ABOUT SARAH PALIN, LOOK, I WAS WITH HIM. I WARMED UP AN AUDIENCE FOR HIM THE DAY AFTER THE CONVENTION IN A BIG RALLY NORTH OF DETROIT AND HE TRIED TO INTRODUCE ME TO SARAH PALIN AND WE COULDN'T GET NEAR HER BECAUSE SHE WAS JUST MOBBED BY PEOPLE. HE WAS THERE WHEN HE INTRODUCED HER AND HE SAW THE ELECTRICITY. I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT AFFECTED US. WE WERE UP IN THE BOOTH. I TURNED TO MY LEFT AND I WAS SITTING NEXT TO THE MOST DECORATED AMERICAN WARRIOR AND ALL OF HISTORY AND BUD HAD TEARS IN HIS EYES. HE WAS SO MOVED. THAT'S THE EFFECT SHE HAD. SO FOR HIM TO BE DOING THAT I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD ANYTHING AGAINST JOHN FOR WHAT HE SAYS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT HAS AFFECTED HIM, BUT THE JOHN THAT I KNOW WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST HEROES I EVER KNEW AND ONE OF THE FINEST MEN I EVER KNEW. Laura: FRANK, IT IS INTERESTING TO GO BACK AND SEE THOSE HEADLINES FROM ALL OF THE ELITE PUBLICATIONS, JOHN McCAIN THE SELLOUT, JOHN McCAIN THE PHONY FRAUD, ALL THE THINGS THEY SAID, BUT NOW HE'S HITTING TRUMP AND HE HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN AT ODDS WITH TRUMP ON A NUMBER OF POLICIES, IMMIGRATION, FOREIGN POLICY TO NAME A FEW, AND NOW NOT JUST BECAUSE I THINK HE'S OBVIOUSLY SUFFERING TERRIBLY, I'VE LOST THREE FRIENDS TO THIS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, IT'S A HORRIFIC DISEASE. YOU SEE THE EBB AND FLOW OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP. IT HAPPENED IN 2000 WHEN HE WAS RUNNING AGAINST W. IT HAPPENED IN 2008 WITH MITT ROMNEY, SO THIS IS NOTHING NEW. JOHN McCAIN UNDERSTOOD HOW TO USE THE PRESS TO HIS OWN ADVANTAGE. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE'S SUCH A GOOD POLITICIAN. BY THE WAY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW IT IS AN HONOR TO SIT NEXT TO YOU AND FRANKLY I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT ANY OF THESE MEN. THEY SUFFERED, TRULY SUFFERED IN PRISONER OF WAR. DONALD TRUMP, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU REMEMBER, I WAS ASKING QUESTIONS IN IOWA AND MY INTERVIEWER SAID THAT JOHN McCAIN IS NOT A WAR HERO. HE WALKED THAT BACK WHEN YOU'RE ON. BUT McCAIN AND THE PRESS. IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD RELATIONSHIP. Laura: THIS IS WHAT CNN SAID TODAY, LET'S WATCH. HE IS NOT A SELLOUT AND I THINK HAVING PRESIDENT TRUMP, JUST BECAUSE HE IS THE PRESIDENT COME AND SPEAK ON HIS BEHALF OR EULOGIZE HIM OR MEMORIALIZE HIM WOULD BE SELLING OUT. SENATOR MCCAIN, I SAY THIS NOT JUST AS IT IS DAUGHTER'S PLAN, BUT AS A REPUBLICAN WHO SUPPORTED HIM, SENATOR MCCAIN IS EVERYTHING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT. I HAVE TO SAY THAT SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE PULLED DONALD TRUMP BEFORE HE SAID THAT ABOUT JOHN. JOHN EJECTED AND HIS AIRPLANE WAS JUST DISINTEGRATED. ONE OF THE WINGS CAME OFF AND AS SOON AS HIS CHUTE OPENED THE WING SWUNG AROUND, BROKE BOTH OF HIS ARMS AND ONE OF HIS LEGS, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW HE WAS ABLE TO OPEN UP MUCH LESS HOW HE COULD SWIM. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW HE SURVIVED BUT I KNOW THAT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE DONE ANY RESISTANCE BECAUSE HE WAS HELPLESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THAT. BUD DAY HAD TO TAKE CARE OF HIM. BUD DAY HAD TO FEED HIM. Laura: COULD YOU HEAR HIM WHERE YOU WERE IN THE HEALTH AND WHERE YOU WERE IN THE HEALTH AN AND? I LIVED WITH HIM FOR TWO YEARS. Laura: YOU ARE SEPARATED YOU WERE THERE FOR SIX YEARS AND YOU ARE SEPARATED FOR A LONG TIME. IN '71 THERE WAS A BIG UPRISING AMONGST US AND JOHN McCAIN EVEN THOUGH BUD DAY WAS THE SENIOR MANAGER, JOHN McCAIN WAS CREDITED WITH BEING THE LEADER OF THAT. AND IN FACT, ON MARCH 19TH THEY TOOK 36 OF US OUT, WE HONESTLY THOUGHT WE WERE BEING TAKEN OUT TO BE EXECUTED AND JOHN McCAIN MADE A JOKE ABOUT IT. A MAN WHO CAN VOLUNTEER TO DIE FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, THAT'S WHAT IT WAS AND MAKE A JOKE ABOUT IT IS REALLY A TOP GUY. I HOLD HIM ALMOST THE SAME STATUS AS JAMES STOCKDALE. Laura: WOW. TO JUST HEAR THE STORIES. HE WOULDN'T GO HOME. THEY SAID TO HIM GO HOME, BUT BECAUSE IN TERMS OF BEING CAPTURED, HE REFUSED AND SO THEY BEAT HIM FOR IT. THOSE THAT ARE CRITICAL OF HIM BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE HOW HE HAS VOTED ON CERTAIN ISSUES, WHO AMONG US IN THIS STUDIO WOULD GIVE OUR LEGS, ARMS, OUR BODY, OUR LIVES? Laura: HE ALSO SAID I THINK AT ONE TIME, I WAS A P.O.W. BUT WE CAN DISAGREE. JOHN KERRY SERVED HIS COUNTRY
