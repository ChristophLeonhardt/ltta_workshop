WHEN THESE COMPANIES --
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
GOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH.
JOINING ME NOW WITH MORE,
AMBASSADOR, FORMER NATIONAL
SECURITY COUNCIL SENIOR
DIRECTOR.
AMBASSADOR, VERY GOOD TO HAVE
YOU WITH US.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO
THIS BREAKING NEWS FROM
NORTH KOREA AND THEIR OBJECTION
TO THESE EXERCISES.
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?
>> I DO THINK THAT WE ARE SEEING
SOME PROBING TO SEE WHAT WE
MIGHT DO.
THERE ALSO CERTAINLY IS A
POSSIBILITY HE'S TRYING TO PLAY
UPON WHAT IS THE UNMISTAKABLE
DESIRE OF THE SOUTH TO HAVE ALL
THIS WORK AND HERE AGAIN SEE IF
HE CAN GET SOMETHING FOR IT.
TO SHOW HE GET SOMETHING EVEN
BEFORE THE SUMMIT.
I THINK THERE'S ONE OTHER
POSSIBILITY.
OBVIOUSLY HERE THE PRESIDENT HAS
MADE IT CLEAR HE IS LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS.
IN HIS BUILDING EXPECTATIONS AND
MAYBE WHAT YOU SEE KIM JONG UN
DO IS ALSO PROBE TO SEE OR AT
LEAST SEND A MESSAGE TO THE
PRESIDENT THAT THIS ISN'T
NECESSARILY A GIVEN.
HE IS I THINK MANEUVERING RIGHT
NOW.
HE'S GOING TO BE KIND OF A K.G.
PLAYER WHEN IT COMES TO
NEGOTIATIONS AND HE IS TESTING
TO SEE HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO
THE UNITED STATES.
>> Martha: WHAT TO THINK
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RESPONSE
SHOULD BE NOW?
>> I THINK THE RESPONSE SHOULD
BE HE'S SERIOUS ABOUT
DISCUSSIONS, BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU
CAN'T TALK TO YOURSELF.
IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO COME TO
THE SUMMIT, THAT'S HIS CHOICE.
>> Martha: I WANT TO TURN YOUR
ATTENTION TO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
PLAYING OUT IN ISRAEL AND ALONG
THE GAZA BORDER.
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF MIXED
RESPONSE IN THE MEDIA WITH
REGARD TO THE VIOLENCE THAT WE
SAW ON THE GAZA STRIP AND HERE
IS SOME OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN
HEARING IN THAT REGARD.
LET'S PLAY THAT.
>> MORE THAN 40 PEOPLE DEAD
TODAY AND THE WHITE HOUSE ISN'T
OFFERING CONDOLENCES, THEY ARE
NOT OFFERING ANY SORT OF
HEARTFELT COMMENTS ON THE LOSS
OF LIFE.
>> WITH THEIR SLINGSHOTS AND
BURNING TIRES, THE PROTESTERS,
INCLUDING SIX CHILDREN WHO WERE
REPORTEDLY KILLED TODAY, SEEM TO
BE LOSING THEIR LIVES FOR
NOTHING.
>> ALL OF THOSE BABIES ARE DEAD.
ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE DEAD.
THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE
DEAD TODAY.
FOR WHAT?
>> Martha: HERE'S THE RESPONSE
FROM BEN SHAPIRO.
>> I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY
MEDIA OUTLETS THAT ARE -- IT'S
ACTUALLY QUITE INCREDIBLE.
HAMAS HAS NOT BEEN UNCLEAR ABOUT
THEIR INTENT HERE.
THEY'VE BEEN SAYING FOR WEEKS
THEY WANT TO SEND LITERALLY
100,000 PEOPLE TO STORM THE
BORDER WITH ISRAEL.
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> LOOK, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT
HAMAS IS TRYING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THIS.
I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE A STEP
BACK AND SAY WHAT IS IT THAT
HAMAS IS TRYING TO DO?
I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL
THINGS.
ONE, THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE
SUBJECT.
THEY WANT TO DIVERT ATTENTION
AWAY ABOUT WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN
GAZA, WHICH IS, IT'S AWFUL.
IF THE PEOPLE IN GAZA IN NO
SMALL PART HOLD HAMAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.
TWO, THEY WANT TO PUT PRESSURE
ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY.
HE IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON THEM
ECONOMICALLY AND WHEN THEY TAKE
ON THE ISRAELIS THIS WAY THEY
OBVIOUSLY PUT HIM IN THE CORNER
AS WELL.
THREE, THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO
STIGMATIZE THE ISRAELIS AND I
DON'T MIND IF THEY DIE IN THE
PROCESS.
A BETTER WAY TO PUT ISRAEL ON
THE DOCKET.
AND FOR THEY ARE PROBABLY TRYING
TO SHOW THEY ARE AT LEAST DOING
IS SOMETHING ON BEHALF OF THE
PALESTINIAN MOVEMENT.
THESE ARE ALL MOTIVATIONS, NONE
OF WHICH RELATE TO DOING
SOMETHING FOR THE PEOPLE OF
GAZA, ALL OF WHICH RELATE TO
HAMAS TRYING TO CHANGE THE
POSITION THAT IT'S IN.
>> Martha: I WANT TO PLAY THIS
FROM NIKKI HALEY TODAY AND GET
YOUR THOUGHTS AT THE U.N.
>> THE COMMON THREAD IN ALL OF
THIS IS THE DISABLING CONDUCT OF
THE IRANIAN REGIME, EVERYTHING
THAT INSISTS ON PROMOTING
VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT THE
MIDDLE EAST WHILE DEPRIVING ITS
OWN PEOPLE OF BASIC HUMAN
RIGHTS.
>> Martha: SHE WALKED OUT
BEFORE THE PALESTINIAN LEADER
SPOKE THERE TODAY.
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT HER
COMMENTS?
>> I THINK SHE IS PUTTING WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN A BROADER CONTEXT.
I DON'T THINK THE IRANIANS ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT'S GOING ON
THERE.
I DO THINK THEY ARE CERTAINLY
INTERESTED.
ONE OF THE THINGS THE IRANIANS
WANT TO DO ESPECIALLY AFTER THE
PRESIDENT MADE THE DECISION ON
WALKING AWAY FROM THE JCPOA IS
TO TRY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT
THERE'S A CLOCK.
-- THERE'S A COST.
IT DOESN'T COME COST FREE.
ARE THEY THE ONES RESPONSIBLE
FOR IT?
