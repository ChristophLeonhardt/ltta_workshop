1
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:07,040
I actually became interested in
wolves when I was about 6

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,676
years old. I read a book by
Jean Craighead George called

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,778
“Julie of the Wolves” and
it was about a girl

4
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,700
who is lost in the tundra
in Alaska and she's raised

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,049
by a family of wolves.

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,818
And when I was 6 I thought I
was going to be just like Julie

7
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:21,354
and that I would be raised by a
family of wolves in the wild.

8
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,691
We feel as though the March
for Science is crucial.

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,360
It's a way to get the public
<involved and motivated about

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,429
standing up for science and
science-based decisions when it

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,233
comes to managing endangered
species or funding

12
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,668
research projects. We truly
believe science has a very

13
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:38,371
important role to play
in our lives.

14
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:42,160
I first started extracting
DNA from organisms when I was

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,879
18, and I got hooked on it
then because it's so cool from

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,348
just a little vial of —
When you have the DNA,

17
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,617
you can't even tell it's there.
This, you can see tissue.

18
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,918
But when you have the DNA,

19
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,820
it's just a little bit of
clear liquid.

20
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:57,457
But from that invisible
product, the DNA,

21
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,626
you can learn so much
about an organism.

22
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,162
Once I did my first DNA
extraction, I never went back,

23
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:05,565
because I think that's so cool.
The sort of hidden history of

24
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,668
anything in a small little,
small little tube.

25
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:13,406
Our lab focuses on studying
the evolution, diversity and

26
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,676
actually even the genomics
of butterflies and moths.

27
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:21,581
Showing solidarity with other
scientists here and

28
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,100
the diverse community of
scientists here is important

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,122
to me and also inspiring
scientists who haven't been

30
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,092
as civically active before to
take a more civic role in

31
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,495
their science. And so I'm
excited about that aspect of

32
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:39,099
march and what it inspires
in a generation of scientists.

33
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,420
I was really lucky growing up
to have a dad who was really

34
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,573
interested in nature and
in the ocean, so I spent a

35
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,476
lot of time along the coast.
So I realize that the ocean

36
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,212
is a really important resource
for much of the world.

37
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,981
And I decided that it was
important to invest time and

38
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,917
energy and resources into
studying how climate change was

39
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:01,688
going to affect this ocean that
impacts so many people.

40
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,757
I am marching for science
because of the way

41
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,726
that it benefits people.

42
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,729
It is really important for
us to continue to support

43
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,565
science federally
and locally,

44
00:02:12,565 --> 00:00:00,000
so that we can protect people.
