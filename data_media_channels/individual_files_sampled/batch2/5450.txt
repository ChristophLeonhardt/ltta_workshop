now we turn to an update on a story we first brought you last night the Trump baby blimp which British activists launched to trolled Donald Trump on his visit next week this giant diaper clad Trump baby blimp is set to fly over London in an attempt to humiliate president Trump and trigger his documented insecurities that some people think he's a baby British officials have cleared take off for the Trump baby blimp and activists raise enough money online it apparently takes about 23,000 dollars to fly a baby this size but here's the new development in this story tonight this Trump baby is hauling in a lot of cash activists now nearing 40 thousand US dollars that is actually more than this baby's London voyage will costs and tonight I can report organisers pledged to use this money to expand operations and take the Trump baby on a world tour now where will the Trump baby blimp fly next at this hour I can tell you we we just don't have any of those locations confirm but organizers are actually taking requests online from other cities that expect a Trump visit a Trump baby blimp World Tour could rile up the president because he is known to get angry at the notion that he is a baby as we noted in our reporting on this last night journalist Josh green reported on how Donald Trump screamed at Paul Manafort during the campaign when he was greeted with news that mana Ford tried to persuade him through TV interviews saying quote you think you've got to go on TV to talk to me you treat me like a baby am I like a baby to you Trump yelled according to green I sit here like a little baby and watch TV and you talk to me am i an effing baby Paul now there are also reports out of London the Trump supporters are punching back at this whole baby name-calling thing the only way they know how with baby name-calling creating their own counter baby balloon that depicts Trump's nemesis London Mayor Sadiq Khan to then fly over London at the same time and they've raised $26,000 they say Trump won't even care about the baby attack that they are countering he's here to do more important things to worry about some protesters on the street he's coming into the Lions nests I think it is kind of embarrassing to Britain actually I mean again we always stand put side by side with each other and is this really the way you welcome a good friend is this the way you welcome a good friend well the question presumes that the UK in the u.s. are friends but there's an old foreign policy saying countries don't have friends they have interests to Gaul and others have been attributed for that quote and critics of course say Donald Trump's approach to immigration and trade has strained America's interests abroad and this saga may give way to who knows maybe a new saying babies don't have friends because they're babies now as these two baby blimps take flight maybe we can all sit down and reflect on how to act a little less like babies and a little more like diplomats that's our final word and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fitting place to end the beat tonight hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
