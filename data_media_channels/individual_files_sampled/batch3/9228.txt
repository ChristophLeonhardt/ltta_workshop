JEANINE: WELCOME BACK TO JUSTICE. I CANNOT COME ALL THE WAY TO ISRAEL AND NOT TALK WITH THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE HERE. SO I HIT THE STREETS TO ASK ABOUT THE NEW EMBASSY AND DONALD TRUMP. TAKE A LOOK AT STREET JUSTICE IN JERUSALEM. HERE I AM IN JERUSALEM, JERUSALEM. HERE I AM IN JERUSALEM, ON THE STREET DOING STREET JUSTICE IN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT ISRAELIS THINK OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSY FINALLY OPENING IN JERUSALEM. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE EMBASSY OPENING? REALLY EXCITING. I THINK HE'S A MAN OF HIS WORD AND WERE PROUD OF HIM IN THIS MOMENT. TO THINK IT WILL CAUSE MORE DANGER IN JERUSALEM? IS THIS TINA FOR SOME KIND OF TERRORISM? I FEEL SAFER IN ISRAEL WITH ISRAEL IS PROTECTING US THAN ANYWHERE. WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE EMBASSY OPENING? ISRAEL IS THE CAPITAL. WHAT YOU THINK OF THE EMBASSY OPENING UP? OPENING UP? THERE YOU HAVE IT, FROM THE RESTAURANT IN JERUSALEM, HERE WE ARE, HISTORIC WEEK. THE EMBASSY IS GOING TO OPEN. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? MORE JOY IN MY HEART THEN THERE HAS BEEN IN 20 YEARS. AND DONALD TRUMP? HE SAID HE IS GOING TO DO IT AND HE DID IT. I DON'T AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HE DOES. JEANINE: WOULD YOU SAY HE IS A MAN OF HIS WORLD. ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. WHAT YOU THINK OF PRESIDENT TRUMP MOVING THE EMBASSY WHENEVER AND SAID THEY WERE AND HE DIDN'T. TRUMP? JEANINE: WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY WILL BE IN JERUSALEM? THE MOST INCREDIBLE MOMENT EVER. GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP. JEANINE: HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY BEING OPENED UP? I BELIEVE IT'S GREAT. EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT IT BUT NOBODY DID IT.
