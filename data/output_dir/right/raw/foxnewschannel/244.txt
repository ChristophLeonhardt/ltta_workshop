1
00:00:09,202 --> 00:00:09,968
>> Laura: A POLICY PROFESSOR

2
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:10,569
IS BLAMING THE TRUMP

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,870
ADMINISTRATION FOR CRIME IN

4
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:12,204
MEXICO.

5
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:15,941
YES, YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT.

6
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:17,109
GUADALUPE JOINS US NOW TO

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:17,442
EXPLAIN.

8
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:19,011
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

9
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:20,979
DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,747
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

11
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:26,051
DEPORTED BACK TO MEXICO WERE

12
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:27,085
ALREADY COMMITTING CRIMES BEFORE

13
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:28,453
THEY WERE DEPORTED BACK TO

14
00:00:28,454 --> 00:00:29,588
MEXICO?

15
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:31,189
BECAUSE YOU WERE SAYING

16
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,125
DEPORTATION POLICY IS MAKING

17
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:33,692
MEXICO'S LIFE WORSE.

18
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:35,193
EXPLAIN.

19
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:36,762
>> MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES

20
00:00:36,763 --> 00:00:37,996
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE VERY

21
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:38,764
VULNERABLE.

22
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:40,766
WE HAVE CARTELS AT THE BORDER,

23
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:41,800
OPERATING AT THE BORDER.

24
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:43,769
WE HAVE CORRUPTION IN MEXICO,

25
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,904
THEREFORE, WHEN YOU DEPORT

26
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:49,007
PEOPLE TO THE BORDER, THEY FIND

27
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,976
THEMSELVES LIKE THEY WANT TO

28
00:00:50,977 --> 00:00:52,377
COME BACK TO THE UNITED STATES.

29
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:53,111
THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR FAMILIES

30
00:00:53,112 --> 00:00:55,881
AND SOME OF THEM ARE FORCED TO

31
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:57,582
PARTICIPATE IN CRIMINAL

32
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,550
ACTIVITIES, OR SOME OF THEM WANT

33
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:01,653
TO GO TO THE UNITED STATES SO

34
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:03,822
THEY HIRED SOME SMUGGLERS THAT

35
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:05,557
ARE IN AN ACTION WITH THE

36
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:05,891
CARTEL.

37
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:06,792
>> Laura: I UNDERSTAND THAT.

38
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:08,360
BUT WHY IS THAT OUR PROBLEM?

39
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:12,864
>> WELL, IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM

40
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,367
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM, AS

41
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:15,667
WELL.

42
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:19,971
BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE CRIMINAL

43
00:01:19,972 --> 00:01:21,106
GROUPS OPERATING ON THE SIDE OF

44
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,174
THE MEXICO BORDER.

45
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:24,743
AS YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE STILL

46
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:25,510
ARRIVING IN THE UNITED STATES NO

47
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:25,911
MATTER WHAT.

48
00:01:25,912 --> 00:01:27,379
>> Laura: DO YOU THINK WE

49
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,581
SHOULD HAVE ANY BORDERS, REALLY?

50
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:31,550
WHY HAVE A BORDER AT THIS POINT?

51
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:36,488
WHY NOT MAKE IT ALL ONE MEXICO

52
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:37,689
AND UNITED STATES AND THE CARTEL

53
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,958
WILL KIND OF GO OUT OF BUSINESS?

54
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,426
WE WILL BE ALL ONE COUNTRY.

55
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:42,994
>> I BELIEVE ANY COUNTRY HAS TO

56
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:44,362
HAVE SOME KIND OF LIMITS, AND I

57
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:46,631
THINK BORDERS ARE IMPORTANT TO

58
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:48,733
HAVE LIMITS.

59
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,068
>> Laura: BUT IF YOU CAN HAVE

60
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,203
A BORDER, PRESUMABLY WHEN PEOPLE

61
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:53,772
DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO BE

62
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:55,774
HERE, THEN THEY CAN BE SENT

63
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:56,074
HOME.

64
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,209
EVERY COUNTRY ON THE FACE OF THE

65
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,276
PLANET SEND PEOPLE HOME WHEN

66
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:00,579
THEY DON'T HAVE PERMISSION, AND

67
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,580
ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE

68
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,781
COMMITTED A CRIME.

69
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:03,982
THEN YOU'RE REALLY SUBJECTING

70
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:04,783
THEM TO DEPORTATION.

71
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:06,685
I THINK AMERICANS DON'T FEEL

72
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:07,786
LIKE IT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

73
00:02:07,787 --> 00:02:09,287
TO MAKE SURE -- WE WANT MEXICO

74
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:11,189
TO BE WELL, BUT WE DON'T WANT

75
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,591
PEOPLE TO CROSS THE BORDER.

76
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:13,992
IT REAL QUICK.

77
00:02:13,993 --> 00:00:00,000
>> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT BUT AT
