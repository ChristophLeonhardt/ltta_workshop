president Trump our Great Mikado virtuous man kicked off his 12 day trip to Asia with some golf club koi fish diplomacy alongside japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a will break down the first few days then Emily Butler and Jacob arey joined the panel of deplorable zz to discuss this awful shooting in Texas former DNC chairman Donna Brazil's seeming to substantiate Seth Ridge conspiracy theories and Hillary's fighting back as Democrats almost uniformly throw her under the bus I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Noel's show there is so much to get to today I just got back from the East Coast this weekend I went to the William F Buckley Jr dinner at Yale which was great that is 100% of any conservative who has anything to do with any college in the country just goes to this one dinner at Yale for academic and intellectual diversity there so when to that my flight was delayed by about a hundred million hours so I got in at about 4:00 a.m. this morning I have been mainlining CAF FA all day it has been just like right intravenous so hopefully we'll have enough high energy we won't have like Jeb Bush eNOS to bring us down we'll have enough high energy to get through all these important topics today and I did get some good news I was so beaten down I came in you know it was really awful Yale has fallen apart and obviously I haven't slept in forever because Yale has faults falling apart but they still drink like fish so is a very exhausting weekend and we got some good news today that we have to talk about first we're gonna keep the lights on for another week

an academic position or a fellowship or college or a society or some social institution the one question that is on all of these applications and all of these forums that you send in is what magazines do you subscribe to because when you go into someone's house I've had the privilege of going into the houses of many wealthy people and one thing I noticed is they all read Architectural Digest I don't know why that is just like the rich guy magazine and it's all there and so people read magazines because it gives you really high quality coverage and commentary and it just brings you into the conversation with people I think that's why all of these secret societies and different clubs and institutions they always ask you what are you what are you reading now I'm a millennial which means two things one I hate delayed gratification I don't want to wait for a physical magazine to come in the mail I'm not gonna deal with it I barely checked my mailbox and the other is I don't have endless money I've already obviously spent all of the blank book money so I don't have endless money to spend hundreds of dollars tho thousands a year subscribing to all of the magazines that I want to read but luckily there is a texture which solves both problems you know magazines weave together great writing beautiful photography all of that stuff so if I want to read National Geographic that'll take me away to another place if I want to see the future I can read Wired some say the world will end in Wired some say in Vice who knows and you know quality magazines should be available

sophisticate all right now we have to get to all of this news this was really crazy I you know I'm I've been I was up all night and in the middle of the night I received exclusive video footage of President Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a caught on a hot mic describing their diplomatic relationship there is beauty in the bellow of the blast there is grandeur in the growling of the game there is the pudding and the lion and the tiger reasonable yes I like to see you tiger from the Congo or the Naga and especially when he's lashing of his tail and earthworks only terrify the tall roots but to him boo scientific there is nothing that's terrific in the falling of a lighter Thunderbolt yeah in spite of all my meekness if I have a little weakness it's a passion for a flight Thunderball incredible footage it is just amazing to really get a peek in at what diplomacy looks like there it is there is eloquent outpouring when the lion is a roaring and our president with his big golden mane was or a roaring earthquakes only terrified adults it's evident very our tastes are one is by the way is that reference the most obscure musical reference we've ever put on any of these shows I think it might I think it might be as Groucho Marx in The Mikado but it does sum it up very well our tastes are one President Trump and Shinzo Abe a seem to get along quite well Trump's journey will be the longest presidential trip to Asia in 25 years quarter of a century the last trip that extended this long was undertaken by President Bush the first and it famously did not end very well ABC News has obtained a videotape that shows clearly what happened when the president fell ill here it's White House correspondent and Compton the lone camera in the dining room was locked in on the head table when President Bush was overcome by nausea and fell forward it appears he lost consciousness as he toppled over onto his host Prime Minister Miyazawa the new scenes show first lady barbara Bush acting quickly recognizing her husband needed help bringing her napkin to his mouth then stepping back to let the Secret Service agents take over I know what you're thinking you're thinking that Perez the Bush senior's Keeling over and vomiting was a bit low energy so Trump decided to make his diplomatic overtures higher energy not by spewing his lunch but by spewing his words the Japanese people are thriving your cities are vibrant and you've built one of the world's most powerful economies I don't know if it's as good as ours I think not okay and what did they try and keep it that way but you'll be second and yet for all of its modern splendor the people of Japan maintain a profound respect for their rich culture heritage and traditions now could you spot the point at which he went off-script I don't know if you could tell could you tell the point where he stood three demons gripped and started adilyn yeah yeah right around there somewhere around there you know ah Bay by the way seemed okay with this the American mainstream media are ripping this to shreds and saying this was awful and terrible diplomacy but obviously okay with it he smiled as his interpreter and his earpiece told him what Trump had said the the conclusion of this meeting has been great Japan has announced that it will go along with US sanctions on North Korea they're going to freeze the assets of 35 North Korean groups and individuals he also underscore ah bay underscored the Trump policy the American policy on North Korea which is no dialogue we've had enough dialogue time to maximize pressure to exemplify the US Japanese cooperation Ave gave Donald Trump a hat embroidered with the phrase Donald and Shinzo make alliance even greater before they headed to play golf I I love it so much this diplomacy has an exuberance to it I mean that even though it doesn't even say Trump and avi air it says Donald and Shinzo it's so campy it's so real politics you know it's being very honest with what what it is there's no pretense here there's no guile you know President Trump said on North Korea the era of strategic patience is over that was the the title strategic patience of Obama's policy toward North Korea which is all it transcends to say our we have strategic patience we're going to lead from behind it just isn't possible right you know it's a euphemism that is so ridiculous as to undermine as to undermine itself ah BAE said dialogue has failed for 25 years so he's throwing throwing some shade on President Obama's foreign policy and so anyway they seem to have gone along quite well CNN could not take it CNN was so furious they had to breathlessly report fake news this was a headline from one of the moments of this trip quote Trump feeds fish winds up pouring entire box of food into koi pond that's what it's oh but it was this moment where Trump and AH Bay were there at the little koi pond with the fish and they were spooning out of spoonfuls of fish food and then the camera zoomed in on Trump and this is this is the line from the from the report President Trump took a moment out of his whirlwind Japanese trip to connect with nature and feed some fish but after a few delicate scoops he resorted to a grand gesture met with some laughter he with a look of enjoyment Trump quickly poured his entire box of food into the pond the move got some laughs and a smile from a bae who actually appeared to dump out his box of food ahead of Trump so they had to bury that line right the whole thing is what an idiot Trump is there's a video that CNN posted where the spooning it out it zooms in on Trump and Trump pours out the rest of the box the reason that they had to add that artificial zoom is because they didn't want to show that ah they had done that first fake news at its finest you know obviously par for the course for CNN but there is no reason to give those people even an ounce of credibility they don't deserve it they don't possess it they are so furious that Donald Trump contrary to all of their expectations all of their insistence is handling diplomacy relatively quite well and so they have to make up student just make up stories out of whole cloth such as Trump endangering the lives of koi fish or or embarrassing himself now compare this compare this to the highly successful foreign trip you know to his previous administration here is the failed Russian reset we worked hard to get there if any clip could exemplify Barack Obama's administration and Hillary Clinton's candidacy it would be that one they failed but you didn't see rampant reporting in the mainstream media on this huge international embarrassment no no no because that was Hillary it's all nice there's a patina of elitism and legitimacy there Donald Trump has been carrying this off very well consider Barack Obama bowing down before every foreign leader he could find he would bow down before the stewardess on his Japan Air flight you know we see brock about whether Donald Trump did not do that he shook Emperor Hirohito's I remember he shoved a Japanese Emperor's hand we're seeing two foreign policies here the Obama policy in which America is a supplicant begging forgiveness for its endless imagined crimes and we're seeing the Trump foreign policy of speaking loudly and carrying the gold-plated golf clubs that Prime Minister Abe a actually gave him which version makes America in the world safer and more prosperous to discuss this we bring on our extra-special confetti panel today Emily Butler from daily wire and also from wandering around madly around the sidewalks Jacob arey thank you both for being here Emily does the world hate us and doesn't matter yes and no as an answer to both of us no it doesn't matter oh yeah no actually I don't think the rest of the world hates us I think what you're seeing now is more and more news organizations start to resemble actually marketing agencies where there is news and then there is news according to this media outlet sponsor so whatever that media outlet sponsor wants us to believe interpret digest is the news that we're going to get you know perfect case in point the whole shinzo a be fish thing I mean that's like classic cutting up of what actually happened and turning it into what you need to know basically everything that's coming from CNN or fox or everything from the left but it was a perfectly good writers to take what actually happened and so mash it up and rewrite everything about it as to make this narrative that they ran only Hollywood can bring us the truth yeah you know a always do this all the time they have some narrative about a event in the news and then it turns out not to be true at all like Michael Brown right they said that was an example of black police brutality against black citizens and he was innocent he was surrendering and all of that and we find out none of that's true the grand jury showed it was true three autopsy showed it was true they said well that wasn't true but it expresses a greater truth that lie expresses the greater truth narrative Jacob why are Democrats so mortified and embarrassed by president Trump's eccentricity by all accounts this foreign policy is much more successful that his predecessors is it just that the left cares more about appearance than reality yes they do care more about appearance than reality and also they're not embarrassed by Trump as the president they're embarrassed that Trump is beating Barack Obama's foreign policy legacy that's what they're embarrassed about so anything that they can make look like a snafu or a gaffe or anything they're gonna turn it and use it against President Trump I think that it's absolutely despicable how how CNN edited that video to make Trump look like a goofball and and whatnot and and one thing that they left out which I thought was kind of funny I thought they would have talked about this is right before Trump went to Japan he and he visited Pearl Harbor yeah you know just I guess just to remind himself okay these are the these people attacked us and for World War two that's what got us into the war so we're now I'm gonna go and shake hands with their and with their Emperor and quite frankly I'm proud of the president for not bowing I'm glad that he respected him and shook his hand but the United States we're not a nobility we bow to no one you know I have always had in their dark recesses of my conspiratorial mind I have always had this theory that when President Bush keeled over and vomited on the Prime Minister of Japan it was really a performance to get back for Pearl Harbor you know George Bush a hero of World War two is a subtle little jab 50 years later okay we have so much more to talk about we have to talk about is awful shooting at the Texas church on Sunday and then we have to just have much better news which is the reveling of the DNC and the Democratic Party falling a part a circular firing squad of my third cousin once-removed former campaign and Donna Brazile but I'm sorry guys I wish that you could stick around if you're watching on Facebook and YouTube but you can't because I need to be able to afford coffe fa and my left is tears tumblr so you'll have to go to the Daily wire comm if you go there it is $10 a month $100 a year for those who have already subscribed thank you very much you help us keep the lights on for those who don't you'll give me you'll get the inner Clavin show you'll get the Ben Shapiro show you'll now get the conversation which is a new series that we've done I know what you're saying Michael I'm more tired than you are you didn't sleep last night well that's fine let me see if this wakes you up the leftist tears tumblr this by the way this this batch is being dedicated to Donna Brazile donna brazile has done more for the propagation of leftist tears in this country than anybody I've ever seen she's done much more for water conservation particularly salty water conservation so go over there right now you gonna have your leftist here's hot or cold always salty and delicious the daily wire calm we'll be right back a militant atheist killed 26 people on Sunday at a Texas church including his grandmother in law this was all after sending threatening text messages to his own mother-in-law authorities now suggest the incident was primarily caused by this domestic dispute the shooter was eventually taken down after a local resident and hero shot back at him through an opening in his armor he shot at his side because he saw that there would be an opening in his armor he flagged down a car and then he chased him as the shooter tried to get away you know the left has been trying to draw an equivalence between shootings such as this the so-called the real senseless violence and terrorist attacks like we saw in New York it is amazing these you'll always hear Democrats refer to actual terrorist attacks as senseless violence even when there's a perfectly sensible and logical reasoning behind those attacks and then they'll refer to senseless violence as a terrorist attack because obviously their view of the world is entirely upside down we should be very careful with language here because terrorism can be defined down to nothing it's a term that's bandied about a lot but it does have a real definition it is the use of violence against civilians to achieve a political goal so when Muslim terrorists jihadi terrorists target civilians to effect to the foreign policy of United States or the foreign policy of their own so-called caliphate that falls under the definition of terrorism if a crazy person just shoots up a bunch of people because he's angry at his in-laws or something to that effect it's awful the the human carnage will look virtually the same but is there is a categorical difference between your run-of-the-mill mass shooting a mass shooting and and a terrorist attack the motive is different and those are different categories so you know they'll they'll blame it on racism or Islamophobia or whatever but there is that categorical difference now this guy I won't even say his name he was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child many now are calling for gun control they're being vicious in mocking people for offering thoughts and prayers even though the victims were at the moment that they were tragically killed all praying they're saying this is awful and terrible and they're blaming Republicans for it but it was illegal it was already illegal for this shooter to have a gun he seemed to get it anyway the state even denied him a license Emily is there any way to stop shootings like this that's I mean if I had the answer to that obviously we could just implement it and everything would be done I don't think that there's a real answer here other than affecting the culture I mean we've had legalized arms since 1776 and we've only recently started to see this uptick in mass shootings I don't know what is the proper cause of that and we talked about you know splitting it up between terrorism you know domestic assault workplace violence you know none of that affects me when I when I go to church or when I go to a parade when I go anywhere you know what what the attacker what the assailants point is or what their end goal is all that matters to me is that I can't go out anywhere anymore and you see that from something that's falling apart in a culture well there is a statistical issue here that a mass shooting is shooting with three or more people killed so those know you know more people every year are killed by hands and feet then are killed by rifles of any sort including the so-called assault weapons and shotguns and so on so there there is a there's a media component of this as well but your point here is quite right you know if you had the answer to how to stop these shootings then you'd say and it would be over and if Democrats had the answer to how to stop these shootings they would effect that legislation would be over but while they mock people who offer thoughts and prayers for this awful outcome of the Fallen nature of man you'll notice that none of the gun control bills that they have proposed would have stopped any of these shootings it wouldn't have stopped any of these shootings there is one potential legal maneuver to reduce these number of shootings but that would be the repeal of the Second Amendment short of that short of mass gun confiscation short of repealing or confiscating rather the 300 million guns in this country no law will change that just as we've seen in in this particular case it was illegal for this guy to own a gun he was denied a license nevertheless he obviously was able to get his hands on plenty of guns one aspect that Democrats often don't want to talk about with this is the mental health aspect we shut down most of the mental institutions in the 1980s because of the discovery of drugs that people would take and it would basically cure their conditions trouble is once they got out of the institution's they stopped taking the drugs and then they there were just a lot of crazy people on the street it's very difficult to involuntarily commit people these days Jacob should we be able to is that an answer to preventing people from undertaking these awful acts I think it could be I I'm always hesitant to say we should we should arrest someone and put them in an asylum against their against their will I'm always hasn't it to say that that's because we found you in one there's a personal component too but it's trying to speak objectively is that it's a hard answer but is that the answer to this mental health crisis I think it could be and you know it's really hard as a conservative because you would have to the government would have to fund these institutions I mean a bunch of it's gonna be hard for a private citizen to convince them to to fund all these loony Bin's right but it's hard as a conservative say oh the federal government needs to be involved but I think they should to some extent because it's a public safety issue and we're seeing that with more of these mentally ill people who are breaking the law and getting their hands on guns and I would just like to say that you know just as a Texan you know my heart goes out fortunately my family they were to our two to three hours something east of the shooting but in Texas is like right next door exactly and I just want to say that my heart goes out to my fellow Texans in this time of crisis and and I know I know Democrats are gonna hate it but my thoughts and prayers are out there is how dare you you awful bigoted and also worth pointing out that this tragedy this guy was taken down by a good guy with a gun a bad guy the gun was taken down by a good guy with a gun unfortunately too late to have saved two dozen people in two dozen people okay really really awful situation definitely another another example of tragedy during the clayvin last weekend and you have thoughts and prayers go out to us and if you have a problem with thoughts and prayers then tuff pal too bad let's move on to good news which is donna Brazile donna Brazile has dedicated her book to seth rich he was that DMC staffer who was gunned down in an apparent robbery gone wrong she said that his death made her fear for her life that it led her to close her blinds and fear of snipers and to install a security system in her home now the right was eviscerated for suggesting that he was this kid Seth rich was involuntarily suicided to borrow a phrase you know the right has considered the Clintons in their conspiratorial recesses to be murderers for three decades and this was you know like number 500 on the list or something we the right was eviscerated for indulging this conspiracy theory Emily are we now seeing the Clintons killed Seth rich theory being revived by the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee well if you ask are the Donald subreddit never needed reviving because they were always hot on the case this is new evidence that has come to light and you know I don't know if that's if that's another bit of marketing that they're just you know pushing out there to get more people to buy her book to find out everything that she meant by that it certainly makes me want to find out more but you know it makes me wonder why if she's being if she's making such a public statement about that why she isn't being questioned about it and why she isn't being suicided for that matter either way from both sides of this there are more questions than answers Jacob the left has vigorously shot down the conspiracy theory is it so fringy i know you're a tinfoil hat guy i don't i think that in this particular case there's just not enough information but i think Donna Brazile when she heard that the fact that she was in investigating what was going on in the DNC hey if if I had been in that situation and I heard that someone on my team or you know on the team had been killed yeah that would make me paranoid too I'm not saying that that was the case with Seth rich but I do I honestly think that maybe there was a little bit of fear that went through her spine and and or and she lacks one clearly you know she's going after the Clintons now when it's okay to do that when Hillary after Hillary's been defeated and now Bernie and Foca Honus are you know the rising stars of the of the Democratic Party so to me this to me I can kind of see her perspective on if she was scared I think though it's just more posturing she just wants to make a clean break from the Clintons and this is the best way to do it I once heard the greatest evidence against the charge that the Clintons are murderers which is that Anthony Weiner is still alive that man is breathing today it basically debunks all of the Clinton murder conspiracy I don't know being a being a registered sex offender kind of destroys all his credibility so even if he was to say something they can because oh hey he's a pedophile that is true and even if the Clintons don't personally murder people they we do know they're pretty cold-blooded so if I were done in Brazil I Pro would have slept with one eye open too but speaking of Donna Brazile she has also had now had apparently admitted that she considered replacing Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on the ticket with Joe Biden and Cory Booker after Clinton passed out in mid-stride on her way to a car in New York listen to how they talk though that she considers the head of the DNC she considered replacing the democratically elected ticket Jacob has the Democratic Party always been so hostile to democracy yes they have this super delicate system which you know whenever there whenever their party members they vote for a candidate they have a super delicate system where it's like people like former Vice President Al Gore you know all these George Soros I'm sure is one of them I don't know if that for sure but it's all these former governors and retired Democrats and donors and they can actually supersede the the will of their own party and I just think that of course yes they're totally anti democracy I know there they're already Anti Republic so to speak but I think that Donna Brazile wanting to do that in the middle of a campaign I think that would have been a bad move on her part because that would have made the party look weak had she had done that earlier when when the party when the primary was still going on it probably would have made more sense but the fact that she did it later I think that I think that only would have helped Trump even more and it is so elitist by a bizarre happenstance I was actually a sommelier at George Soros's wedding so it was in a room with all of these people and to hear them talk they have utopia it's that Davos view of the world they have it they're gonna they're gonna tell those people to get in line and yeah so what if if their constituents elected the this ticket for the general election I don't know if it's gonna be the best she's a little bad health let's just replace the whole thing not even with the guy who lost but completely separate candidates because we know what's best for the proletariat it's an aristocracy it is it is it is a very perverse it's an aristocracy without any of the class exactly Emily did Biden and Booker have the better chance taking her claim on its merit should she have replaced Hillary Clinton with with Biden Booker and how will this all affect strategy in 2020 I mean I think Biden and Booker may have had a chance in the primaries even towards the end of the primaries I don't think with less than two months left to go there's going to be any chance of swapping somebody out in the middle of a national election I don't think that was necessarily strong decision to even consider and I don't think I think what what her answer was is that she couldn't do it to the supporters of Hillary which is ultimately what made her change her mind at the last minute I mean no it would have been a show of desperation like Jacob said there would have been it would have shown absolute collapse within the party which was already starting to fray at the DNC when you had people trying to chant to cover up the sounds of Hillary being booed on the platform satoru Biden and Booker were certainly better candidates but at a certain point you got to live with your decisions and you have to have to move on and not show utter collapse right before a tight presidential election all right excellent panel thank you for being here Emily Butler from The
