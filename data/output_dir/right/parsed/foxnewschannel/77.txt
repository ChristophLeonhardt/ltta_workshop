AINSLEY: IS HILLARY CLINTON
REALLY THE DEMOCRAT'S PARTY BEST
HOPE FOR 2020?
OUR NEXT GUEST SEEMS TO THINK
SO.
IN HIS LATEST OP-ED, ENTITLED,
COUNT ON HILLARY CLINTON RUNNING
AGAIN, MR. MICHAEL GOODWIN
WRITES, MRS. CLINTON DESPITE HER
ENORMOUS FLAWS AND TWO
PRESIDENTIAL DEFEATS, CAN'T BE
RULED OUT AS THE PARTY'S BEST
HOPE.
NEW YORK POET COLUMNIST AND
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR MICHAEL
GOODWIN JOINS US NOW.
HI, MICHAEL.
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD SHE DO IT
AGAIN?
WHY WOULD THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
PUT HER UP?
>> SHE IS NOT MY FAVORITE
OBVIOUSLY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT
FIELD SHE IS UP AGAINST, CORY
BOOKER, JOE BIDEN, TO BERNIE
SANDERS, YOU LOOK AT THAT GROUP,
THERE MAY BE AS MANY AS 20 OF
THEM WHO WANT IT.
YOU SAY WHICH AMONG THEM COULD
DEFEAT HER?
THAT IS SOMETHING OF THE TEST.
SHE IS SOMETHING OF A INCUMBENT
NOMINEE.
WHO WILL KNOCK HER OFF?
I THINK SHE WANTS IT.
SHE WANTS IT MORE THAN ANYBODY
ALIVE.
SO WHEN I LOOK AT THE FIELD I
THINK SHE IS STILL THE
STRONGEST.
SHE CAN RAISE THE MONEY.
SHE HAS THE RECOGNITION.
SHE HAS A FAN BASE, LET'S FACE
IT.
SHE GOT 67, 66 MILLION VOTES THE
LAST TIME?
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE GETS THAT
MANY THIS TIME.
SOMEBODY HAS TO DEFEAT HER
WITHIN THE PARTY TO TAKE THAT
AWAY FROM HER.
I DON'T SEE RIGHT NOW ANYBODY
ABLE TO DO THAT.
AINSLEY: ESPECIALLY AFTER MAYBE
THE "ME TOO" MOVEMENT AS WELL.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AND I THINK THE PROBLEM, WHEN
YOU SEE CORY BOOKER FOR EXAMPLE,
WITH HIS "SPARTACUS" MOMENT.
HE IS COMES OFF AS A
LIGHTWEIGHT.
CAN YOU LEAD THE PARTY AND GO
TOE-TO-TOE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THOSE ARE THE TESTS.
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE ANY OF THOSE
PEOPLE, ANDREW CUOMO, GOVERNOR
OF NEW YORK, ELIZABETH WARREN,
CAN YOU IMAGINE THEM ONE-ON-ONE
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP IN A DEBATE
FOR THE PRESIDENCY?
JUST HARD TO IMAGINE THAT THEY
ALL DON'T LOOK LIKE LIGHTWEIGHTS
COMPARED TO THE PRESIDENT.
AINSLEY: EVEN JOE BIDEN?
PEOPLE LIKE HIM.
>> THEY ALWAYS LIKE HIM BUT THEY
NEVER VOTE FOR HIM.
HE GETS BASICALLY 1% WHEN HE
RUNS.
I THINK HE WILL BE 78 OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT COME THE
NEXT INAUGURATION.
HE IS VERY OLD.
BERNIE SANDERS, VERY OLD.
I THINK CLINTON AND TRUMP ARE
NOT YOUNG BUT THEY'RE NOT TOO
OLD YET.
AINSLEY: HISTORICALLY SPEAKING
IF YOU HAVEN'T WON IN THE PAST,
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF WINNING
AGAIN?
WE SAW EVEN JOHN McCAIN RAN A
FEW TIMES, WAS NEVER SUCCESSFUL.
>> RIGHT.
ESPECIALLY SINCE SHE HAD THE
NOMINATION.
YES I THINK HISTORY IS AGAINST
HER.
ALL OF THOSE THINGS.
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU LOOK
FORWARD, AND YOU SAY, WHO CAN
BEAT HER, I THINK THAT'S THE
TEST.
WHO CAN GO TOE-TO-TOE WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP?
WE KNOW SHE CAN DO THAT.
SHE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES.
I WOULD NOT VOTE FOR HER.
I FEEL SOMEWHAT AWKWARD
DEFENDING HER AGAINST A LOT OF
DEMOCRATS WHO ARE TRYING TO TEAR
HER DOWN BUT I THINK IT IS HARD
TO SEE ANYBODY RIGHT NOW ON THAT
LIST WHO CAN BEAT HER.
KAMALA HARRIS, MICHAEL
BLOOMBERG?
AINSLEY: WE COULD SEE ANOTHER
