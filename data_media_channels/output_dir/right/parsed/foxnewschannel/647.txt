BRIAN: 14 MINUTES BEFORE THE
TOP OF THE HOUR.
HELSINKI MANIPULATES AWAY.
THIS HAPPENED MOMENTS AGO.
ABBY: THIS IS VLADIMIR PUTIN
ARRIVING AT THE PRESIDENTIAL
PALACE JUST MINUTES AGO.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ALSO
EXPECTED ANY MOMENT.
WE KNOW HE HAS LEFT HIS
RESIDENCE.
HE IS ENROUTE.
HE WILL BE AT THE PALATES IN
JUST MINUTES.
STEVE: JOINING US RIGHT NOW
IS FORMER U.K. INDEPENDENCE
PARTY LEADER AND FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR MY GENTLEMAN NIGEL E
CONTRIBUTOR MY GENTLEMAN NIGEL W
CONTRIBUTOR MY GENTLEMAN NIGEL O
JOINS US FROM LONDON.
AINSLEY EARHARDT IS OUTSIDE
THE PALACE IN HELSINKI.
NIGEL, LET'S START WITH YOU.
TO HAPPEN VERY SHORTLY, THE
PRESIDENT'S SUMMIT IS THAT
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF
DEMOCRATS HERE IN THE UNITED
SPIES WERE INDICTED FOR
MEDDLING IN OUR ELECTION,
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THE
SUMMIT.
BEEN FOUND SPYING.
WE DO IT TO THEM.
IT MAY NOT BE VERY SEEMLY,
BUT IT'S HOW THE WORLD
WORKS.
THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT
OTHER THAN A VERY STRANGE
COINCIDENCE OF TIMING.
TEST IS ASK SOMEBODY, DO YOU
WANT BETTER RELATIONS
CONTINUAL TO DETERIORATE?
AND ANYBODY WITH HALF A
BRAIN WILL SAY DO YOU KNOW
WHAT?
TALKING IS BETTER THAN NOT
TALKING.
ABBY: NIGEL, I KNOW YOU WERE
WITH THE PRESIDENT A FEW
DAYS AGO.
TALKING TO HIM, WHAT IS
DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS MEETING
BECAUSE PUTIN HAS MET WITH
OUR PRESIDENTS IN THE PAST
THEY HAVE ALL PRESSED THIS
RESET BUTTON, SAYING THINGS
ARE GOING TO GET BETTER.
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO
DIFFERENT BETWEEN THESE TWO
MEETINGS TODAY.
>> THE FACT IS THE PREVIOUS
MEETINGS HAVE HAPPENED
AROUND THE BACK OF GLOBAL
SUMMITS.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY
HAVE SAT DOWN SPECIFICALLY
TO WORK OUT WHERE THIS
RELATIONSHIP IS GOING.
IT IS IMPORTANT.
THERE ARE QUESTIONS, CLEARLY
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS TO
ASK OF PUTIN.
YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP
SAYS LOOK, IF YOU EVER HAVE
OR YOU EVER INTEND TO MEDDLE
BUT, MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN
START TO HAVE A MORE
SENSIBLE RELATIONSHIP.
AT THE MOMENT WHAT WE HAVE
GOT IS WE HAVE GOT THE
ESTABLISHMENT BLAMING
WITHOUT AN ANSWERS.
BRIAN: GO AHEAD, AINSLEY.
AINSLEY: THANK YOU, BRIAN.
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THOSE 12
INDICTED WILL BE EXTRADITED
BACK TO AMERICA SO WE CAN
SEND THEM THROUGH THE COURT
THAT WOULD BE A GESTURE OF
GOODWILL ON PUTIN'S PART.
I'M NOT SURE HIS PERSONALITY
IS QUITE MADE THAT WAY.
BRIAN: UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR
EXTRADITE FOR ANOTHER
COUNTRY.
VLADIMIR PUTIN CAN'T DO IT
IF HE WANTED.
TO SAY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO
PEOPLE WHO SAY THE RUSSIANS
HACKED BREXIT AND THEY
HACKED U.S. ELECTIONS AND
WON ON BOTH ENDS?
AND NOBODY THOUGHT TRUMP
WOULD HAPPEN.
THE ESTABLISHMENT WHO
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY
MIDDLE ENGLAND AND MIDDLE
AMERICA VOTED IN A WAY THAT
THEY CAN'T COMPREHEND.
THEY ARE DESPERATELY LOOKING
FOR AN EXCUSE.
CONSPIRACY THEORY.
I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED
ENDLESSLY BY THE GUARDIAN OF
WORKING WITH THE RUSSIANS.
VODKA.
LUDICROUS.
STEVE: THE NEWS YESTERDAY
WAS THAT THERESA MAY, THE
PRIME MINISTER, SAID WHEN
SHE SAT DOWN WITH THE
PRESIDENT THE PRESIDENT SAID
SUE THE EU.
WAS THAT ADVICE FROM YOU.
>> ALL I CAN SAY OF THIS,
UNDERSTANDS NEGOTIATIONS.
AND HE UNDERSTOOD THAT WE
HAD PAID HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF POUNDS INTO AN
ORGANIZATION EVERY SINGLE
YEAR, YOU KNOW, TENS OF
BILLIONS OVER THE LAST
DECADE, TO AN ORGANIZATION
NEGOTIATIONS BEING TOUGH I
DON'T TAKE CREDIT FOR IT THE
>> THERE THE PRESIDENT TALKS
TO ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE.
