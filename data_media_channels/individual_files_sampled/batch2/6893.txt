the FBI has fired Peter struck he was the FBI agent who was caught sending text messages anti-trump text messages to a lawyer for the FBI by the name of Lisa Paige and so he did testify in front of our lawmakers and the Trump administration has been going after him aggressively an investigation found that his anti-trump bias played no role in the Russia investigation he was immediately taken off of that investigation as soon as Bob Muller knew about the text messages but Trump is capitalizing off of the whole Peter struck story and I believe is using this to further push for certain members of this investigation to get fired so let me give you some of the recent tweets and then also we'll talk a little bit about how he's attacking Jeff Sessions again so Trump had tweeted that fired FBI agent Peter struck is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started there was no collusion or obstruction with Russia and everybody yeah yeah so bored Jesus I know stop tweeting the same thing you maniac he's tweeted that like a million goddamn times alright so by the way just this quick side note there has been a GoFundMe page for Peter struck and he was able to raise or at least this page was able to raise three hundred thousand dollars in less than a day and a half I'm sure the number has increased since we last checked also Trump had tweeted they were all in on it clear Hillary Clinton and frame Donald Trump four things he didn't do Gregg Jarrett on Fox and Friends if we had a real attorney general this witch-hunt would never have been started looking at the wrong people okay so that was his response to a fox news segment he's watching he's live tweeting you know he's not TYT live tweeting but he's tweet he's a fox one this yeah and so in that tweet he went after Jeff Sessions okay so there's two parts of the story one is the firing of Peters truck I think it's a terrible yeah what does it do it encourages them so far Donald Trump is attacked James Comey and then fired him then he attacked deputy director Andrew McCabe who was fired and now Peter struck attacked by Donald Trump fired what are you doing you're just encouraging the monster so everyone he's wrongly attacking you go okay yeah I don't want it to be a distraction I know the President to tweet about it that's the reality you think Christopher Rea looked at this and was like oh I think what Peter struck did was so bad he had a political opinion alright great then why don't you fire almost everyone in the FBI well how many people died happy I voted for Obama how many of them voted against Obama by all accounts the majority of FBI agents are Republicans so should we fire every Republican the middling did they ever say anything bad about Obama in their private lives instructed in his private life my guess is overwhelmingly so we're gonna go on a witch-hunt and fire everyone who says something bad about Obama or Hillary Clinton are you kidding me you'd have to fire most of the FBI probably at that point how about Bernie Sanders Peter struck had terrible things to say about Bernie Sanders that I think Bernie Sanders is a great candidate do I think struck should be fired for that no because of course they have political opinions so they all they did was they take those texts and they blew him out of proportion and and it's it's so obviously brazenly political and the fact that we have to have these nonsense conversations as if we're not adults and we don't know what's going on and then they get encouraged by Christopher Rea you schmuck they're looking to fire and imprison you do you know that the director of the FBI is of course a Republican Chris Wright okay he's the one that just fired struck Jerry Falwell Jr is talking about how he should be imprisoned not not just fired imprisoned so go ahead and courage them like an idiot how many times have we gone has seen this movie now it's Republicans doing it usually it's Democrats who are like oh I'm so sorry I'm so sorry even though you're totally wrong and I'm totally right I'll fire the person I'll get rid of them because it's a distraction it's such cowardice and weakness so all right so it's the Republicans that are doing the FBI they'll come for you next you idiot now let's go to the tweet not the same thing about collusion but the other one races i wish made a real Attorney General I mean we've gotten used to a lunatic for president an absolute lunatic in my lifetime I've covered politics for several decades now no president it taxes own Attorney General in public that's insane that's insane and says you're not a real Attorney General and what did he call he's called a week and I can ineffectual etc over the weekend who does that what kind of maniac does that and ok put aside the fact that he's clearly mentally unstable put that aside for a second we're putting that aside for the President of the United now the second part of it is hey come on man unless you're a totally dishonest actor or a sad pathetic brainwashed Magga dude okay why do you think if he hates session so much that he's not firing him if he was worried about sessions for other reasons not to cover his own ass but he is concerned that he's not doing a job good job as Attorney General does Donald Trump not know how to fire people I said that's how he got famous by firing people on apprentice he's fired plenty of people from the White House why does he just fired Jeff Sessions he doesn't fire him because it's obviously to cover up first crimes and he would be charged with obstruction of justice if he fired his own Attorney General that where the Justice Department was investigating I mean he would he would fire jeff Sessions simply because Jeff Sessions recused himself and so and that is why he keeps insulting him trying to get him to quit so that he could set off fraud in fire sessions okay he happened to quit so and I happened to find some Lackey I don't piece out of like these a lot of them have turned out I may be Rudy Giuliani maybe I'll point what it was idiot sons or something okay Donald Trump jr. is a new Attorney General guess what he fires or was assigned a new fire smaller I'm cleared you can't see this as political if you can't see this is pathetic political you're in one of a couple of categories one is your manga guy who just doesn't care loser and all you care about is more good boy good boy good you don't care about facts at all you're pathetic or there's a lot of folks in the mainstream media where like I'm sure he says this she says that I don't know why they fired struck I don't know why didn't want fire stations that look a lot of them point out a lot of them that there's a good reason why he's threatening sessions and trying to bully him etc but overall even they're pulling their punches it's super obvious what's happening and wouldn't they pull their punches we get into a false debate this isn't a debate Donald Trump clearly wants to end the investigation he says it every goddamn day it's an investigation of him if there were if the FBI was investigating you do you think you could just end it like hey you know what I'm tired of this yeah you could just fire the people doing the investigation yeah well hey yeah it's like an enemy for what money-laundering or doing whatever other nefarious acts I fire you or you try to somehow get the prosecutor fired that would obviously be obstruction of justice and you go to prison for a long long time I'm so tired of it too easy wasteful Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below
