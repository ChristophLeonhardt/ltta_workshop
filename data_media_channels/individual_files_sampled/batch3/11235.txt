the National Security Agency in the United States is facing troubling times with a number of employees leaving the service increasing dramatically but to discuss this we're now joined live by former NSA Technical Director turned whistleblower William Binney thanks for joining us on the program sir good to have you on we understand a lot of key staff have quit the NSA in the last few years does it sound like there's something about the organization people perhaps aren't comfortable with that isn't right I mean why are people leaving well my my guess on that is that the the can the internally in NSA you see the program called see something say something about employees your fellow workers so they've got the workers inside NSA watching the other workers so that they can get they what their objective is to get somebody to tell them about someone who might be another Edward Snowden so that was the whole program that's what that's all about so I'm sure that that creates a very hostile you know kind of a bad work environment and in addition to that I think some of the things they're doing like spying on US citizens spying on everybody in the planet they object to and they've even written internally some from some of the material from Ed Snowden they've read they've written articles about not being able to figure things out because there's just too much data for them to work with so I think those are the basic reasons we also understand there's fewer and fewer people applying to work for the agency you mentioned Edward Snowden there one you know very public very famous whistleblower I mean does that trend reflect a sort of public distrust perhaps in what the agencies doing in the wake of those Wilson blowing activities such as yourself on Edward Snowden as well yes and I think their their participation in this fake Russia gate thing is also discrediting them and so you know who wants to work for a corrupt organization and that's what that's what we have out there now there have been a lot of security precautions introduced you mentioned one of them you know among employees since the Edward Snowden leaks do you think that's made working at the NSA more difficult as that affected the work environment somehow internally oh yeah I think that destroys the morale of people do it work doing the work there I mean how can you it's like you're in the middle of the that was an original program set up by the Stasi - they did the same thing in East Germany so I mean well when you wait I mean anybody who had a vendetta or some gripe against someone else could say something about them you know in without giving their names and just to report them to something just to get them into trouble and have difficulty so I mean that just sets up a very bad work environment for more time now and you know if your experience and what you've had what actions can NSA do in terms of reforming itself introducing measures you know to change that environment you mentioned which is which has changed and become more difficult for employees well I mean they have to they have to encourage you know creativity and and independence and get-get-get the fear of actually trying to do something out of the employee so they're not afraid to try things I mean when you have people watching you all the time for some kind of slip-up I mean that kind of that kind of makes you inhibited that kind of says I don't want to try to do things because somebody might perceive it incorrectly and if they do and I get reported I get in trouble so you know that's that's a very bad and a thing for them to be doing so they need to correct that they need to they need to also they need to automate be automate automate automate automatically audited on what they're doing so that the you know Congress can really know what's happening and the people can really know and so can the Justice Department if they're doing illegal things like violating the Constitution of the United States butts are currently doing now so they need to correct all of that and then that will create a better work environment and actually see that get the people who are working there to see that they're actually doing positive things just in terms of water security of legations here presumably you know there is this fall in recruitment and applications people leaving NSA there's an important job you know amid a rise in terror threat increases other crime increases as well I mean do you think this issue will have a wider security obligation for the United States at all well I mean I don't see them succeeding at stopping terrorism any I mean the only thing they stopped are this setups that the FBI does you know they entrap people as far as the the attacks that have really been planned by terrorists or people who and who are intending harm to people I mean they haven't stopped this for any of them that I know of because Alexander general Alexander former director there had claimed to the Judiciary Committee in the Senate that they'd stopped 54 attacks and he was challenged by Senator Leahy to prove it and he couldn't prove any of them so I mean the point is the thing that they're doing is unconstitutional illegal it's crimes against the laws of the United States and they need to stop that that would change some of the way that the working employees working there would perceive the the job and the Charter and the duties inside NSA so I mean from for what you're saying William understanding this is really an internally routed problem it's not something that's just an external PR image that needs a PR makeover for people to apply it's something that's very much internal is that is that what you're saying yeah it's fundamentally a cultural issue inside NSA they developed a culture that says you know we are basically on our own doing our own thing if Congress gives us money it's our money you know it's not theirs and we're not accountable to them or anybody else how we spend it or how we use it that has to change alright whistleblower and former NSA technical director William Binney thanks for joining us today giving us your take on that story
