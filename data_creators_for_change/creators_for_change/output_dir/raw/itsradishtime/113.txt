00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
hi guys so last week I was at VidCon and

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,160
while everything pretty much was awesome

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,810
one of the definite highlights for me

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,870
was the women on YouTube workshop we got

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,639
some brave new groups and just all share

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,040
together what kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of issues are facing</font>

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,570
women on YouTube and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,820
watch the whole thing paul roth actually

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,740
filmed the group i was in and you can go

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,960
watch it over here my group talked a lot

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,850
about intersectionality which made me so

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,920
happy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the session we</font>

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,869
all kind of came back to the large group

14
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,179
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about how we can take like</font>

15
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,920
the positive energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came out of</font>

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,930
that session and being like yeah we can

17
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,969
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything and just moving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it forward</font>

18
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,739

23
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,579
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I'm doing right now one</font>

24
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,559
why did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you join YouTube and how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">you categorize your content / style this</font>

26
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,420
channel I started in 2011 because I

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,030
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get better at drawing and I</font>

28
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if I uploaded like a</font>

29
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,780
time-lapse drawing video every single

30
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">day I would get better I never got</font>

31
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,470
better that's when I found out how cool

32
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,570
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community part of YouTube could</font>

33
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,180
be so stuck around and I started doing

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,950
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the format</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm doing now</font>

35
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,939
for Rita 2014 question to what are your

36
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,740
dreams or goals for your features<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

37
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,439
content<font color="#CCCCCC"> creator and are there any big</font>

38
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,759
projects that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on in the</font>

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,320
future I have two products that I want

40
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on one is a channel about</font>

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,210
linguistics it was maybe my favorite

42
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">subject that I ever studied but I didn't</font>

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,439
study it nearly as long as I would have

44
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,720
liked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so want to learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more and</font>

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,729
having a son with me and there's another

46
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">super secret project that is not real</font>

47
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,170
enough for me to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about yet but</font>

48
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,659
it'll have one of you knows oh it's so

49
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,369
annoying when people do that three are

50
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,470
there any unique challenges you faced as

51
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,420
a woman on this very public internet

52
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,520
platform how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with them</font>

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,009
sometimes I do get sexist comments but I

54
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:56,380
still

55
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,000
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the most part I'm small enough</font>

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,520
that trolls don't really find me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

57
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,860
make a video for yesallwomen last year

58
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,920
that drew immense amounts paid but I

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,139
just don't engage I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

60
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,959
get more racist comments than I get

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,910
sexist one exception or the line is

62
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,620
though right because sometimes I do

63
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,920
wonder if being women makes people take

64
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,680
my content less seriously or be lost

65
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,239
receptive to what I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say but I</font>

66
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,590
don't know because they're not watching

67
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,470
question for which of your videos has

68
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,870
given you the most satisfaction my

69
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,120
product for awesome video for 2014

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,530
because that was the first time I've

71
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,269
ever really spoke about race on my

72
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,310
channel and it's important to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

73
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,200
and it's a big part of my experience so

74
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,880
I'm glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I found my voice on that</font>

75
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">topic another one is my video on</font>

76
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">impostor syndrome because ended up</font>

77
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,450
getting really positive feedback on that

78
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,370
from people that said it helped<font color="#CCCCCC"> them and</font>

79
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,299
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the first time I</font>

80
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,370
realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I could use what I'm</font>

81
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,310
making to not just kind of like process

82
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,519
my own thoughts but to build empathy and

83
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,230
understanding and other people and<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

84
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,920
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel less alone and when I managed</font>

85
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,590
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make that connection it just feels</font>

86
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,380
really good and three is my creative

87
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,819
friends series it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very popular but</font>

88
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,730
I really like making it and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

89
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,350
pretty enlightening for me as somebody

90
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,569
who just feels a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of despair about</font>

91
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,910
not being good enough at things that

92
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's just kind of how everybody feels</font>

93
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,200
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 what advice would you give</font>

94
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,269
other women and<font color="#E5E5E5"> girls on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube don't</font>

95
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,700
care about how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> dudes are watching</font>

96
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,680
when I first<font color="#E5E5E5"> started out I used to look</font>

97
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,600
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> my analytics and be like oh man this</font>

98
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,720
is like 65 percent women and only

99
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,250
thirty-five percent men and that's

100
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,380
terrible<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take me</font>

101
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,109
seriously but like why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a women</font>

102
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:46,900
oriented channel women are great you

103
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,050
don't need men to like it

104
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,690
to be making legitimate stuff I mean if

105
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">they do it's fine like eighteen percent</font>

106
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,640
of you guys out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> dudes but I don't</font>

107
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,290
think that being recognized by men

108
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,480
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mark of success the other</font>

109
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,000
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like use the out of a</font>

110
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,820
block button if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me a racist or</font>

111
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,220
sexist comment instantly you're going to

112
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,750
be blocked<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't really care to engage</font>

113
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">with you I don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to make a</font>

space for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you on my channel blocked</font>

115
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,700
goodbye and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's been really</font>

116
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,829
good for my mental<font color="#E5E5E5"> health as a creator</font>

117
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,100
so just don't don't even give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the</font>
