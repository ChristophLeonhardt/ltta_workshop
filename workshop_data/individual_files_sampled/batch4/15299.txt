you have seven years in office the not every decision you're going to make as me gonna please everyone but I think broader than that it's the ego that the mayor so constantly has displayed you know it just as as he's received more and more criticism over the years it seems like his leash has gotten tighter and tighter in terms of he reacts like a petulant child a lot of the time when Michelle Rempel criticized him he kind of lost it when now bill Smith he's kind of losing it in all these forums he called one other mayoral candidate a four-letter word at a forum the University of Calgary I mean he's he's losing his cool and I think Calgarians are seeing that as a manifestation of his of his large ego do you think some of the other things are coming into play like the money wasted on these well frankly ugly public art projects or the secrecy of the council meetings or just the tax increases like I think people really respond to things that hit them in the pocketbook and when we they see these constant tax increases spent on hideous public art projects I think that really annoys people oh absolutely and I look at what's happening in Calgary right now it's almost been 10% unemployment the last year we have a 30% vacancy rate downtown and yet we're spending hundreds of thousands on public art that no one wants you've got a city council that's constantly raising taxes putting these you know pet projects like bike lanes and green bins and you know whatever it is ahead of the needs of ordinary residents who really probably just need a break right now because the state of the economy this is this is a not what Calgarians want to see of their government they don't it's it's adding insult to injury when you've got a council pursuing its own little agenda that isn't in line with the reality that category has ten percent another to see 30% vacancy rate downtown that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
