Neil: I THINK THE BLANKENSHIP HAS HIT THE FAN, NO PUN INTENDED. DON BLANKENSHIP THAT LOST THE WEST VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IS GOING TO RUN AS A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE. THAT COULD MONEY THAT JOE MANCHIN COULD SQUEAK IN AND REMAIN A DEMOCRATIC SEAT. WE HAVE KATIE HERE WITH US AND FORMER OHIO DEMOCRATIC STATE SENATOR, CAPRI CAFARO. THIS COULD CHANGE THE DYNAMICS. WHAT DO YOU THINK? NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THERE'S A NUMBER OF HURDLES THAT BLANKENSHIP WILL HAVE TO COME THROUGH FOR HIM TO GET ON THE BALL LOT. HE HAS TO HAVE SIGNATURES TO GET HIM ON AS A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE. HE COULD BE SUED UNDER THE SORE LOSER LAW. Neil: YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE. BUT THE WAY HE'S GOING ABOUT IT, HE COULD DO IT THAT CONFUSED ME. BOTTOM LINE IF HE PULLS IT OFF, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT HE SPLIT THE ANTI-DEMOCRAT PRO TRUMP VOTE AND REALLY CONNED HAND THE SEAT BACK TO JOE MANCHIN. THIS IS REALLY NOT GOOD NEWS FOR THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, NOR THE REPUBLICANS BEING ABLE TO HOLD ON TO THAT SEAT IN WEST VIRGINIA. WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS SAYING HE DIDN'T FARE THAT WELL. THE PEOPLE WOULD ETHER VOTE FOR HIM ON THE NOMINEE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ARE MORE INCLINED TO VOTE REPUBLICAN ANYWAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK THAT'S CORRECT. AT THE SAME TIME, HE IS GOING TO DRAW A WAY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF VOTERS. HE WILL INJECTED DISCORD AND CHAOS. HE WILL BE A ROY MOORE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT REPUBLICANS NEED TO THEY MANCHIN'S SENATE SEAT. IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE WHEN YOU HAVE EFFECTIVELY 50 SEATS IN THE SENATE WITH SENATOR McCAIN IN ARIZONA, YOU NEED TO EFFECTIVELY TAKE THIS AWAY. BLANKENSHIP COULD RUIN THAT. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW POLLING IS GOING IN THE STATE. MANCHIN IS IN THE RACE OF HIS LIFE. I WAS TRYING TO PLAY THIS OWN IN MY OWN HEAD AND THINKING IF HE DOES MANAGE TO GET ON A THIRD PARTY BALLOT, HE WILL DEMAND ATTENDANCE AT DEBATES. IF I'M JOE MANCHIN, SAYING IF HE'S NOT INCLUDED, I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE. IT COULD CREATE A DRAMA. IT COULD BE THE REPUBLICANS WORST NIGHT NIGHTMARE. ATTORNEY GENERAL MORRISEY IS DEALING MANCHIN BY TWO. IT'S ONE OF THE FIVE TRUE REALISTIC PICKUPS THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. SO ESSENTIALLY IF BLANKENSHIP WINS OUT, BEATS THE SORE LOSER LAWS, 1 OR 2 TAKEN AWAY FROM MORRISEY WILL HAND IT TO MANCHIN IN A STATE THAT REPUBLICAN WON BY 20 POINTS. Neil: AND IN THE HOUSE, THEY STILL TALK A BLUE WAVE. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A VERY GOOD SHOT AT INCREASING THEIR MARGIN IN THE SENATE. EVEN WITH THIS, DO THEY NOT? IT'S INTERESTING. I JUST RECENTLY READ AN ARTICLE TALKING ABOUT I BELIEVE IT WAS FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. IT SAID IN 2012, CLAIRE McCASKILL WAS ON THE BALLOT. SHE PULLED IT OUT THERE. SHE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT IS ON THE FENCE, FIGHTING FOR HER LEAF IN THIS CIRCLE. BECAUSE BARACK OBAMA IS NOT ON THE BALLOT, THEY'RE BASICALLY PROJECTING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTE THAT HAS TRADITIONALLY VOTED DEMOCRATIC WILL SIT AT HOME. THEY COULD HAVE MADE THE DIFFERENCE FOR CLAIRE McCASKILL IN 2012. THEY WON'T BE THERE IN 2018. THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF A PLACE WHERE TURNOUT WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN WHETHER OR NOT DEMOCRATS CAN PICK UP OR RIDE SOME KINDS OF A THEORETICAL BLUE WAVE, WHICH I THINK IS MORE OF A BLUE TRICKLE. KATIE, IN ORDER TO GET A BLUE WAVE, PEOPLE HAVE TO BE IN A MOOD FOR A MOMENTOUS SHIFT. IF THE ECONOMY IS SEEMED TO BE BETTER THAN IT WAS AND THE VIEW OF PEOPLE'S OWN SENSE OF PERSONAL VALUE IS BETTER THAN IT WAS, JOB SECURITY FOR THEIR KIDS BETTER THAN IT WAS, MAYBE WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING HERE. THEY ARE. DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ONE DURING THE ELECTION. THEY LEARNED NOTHING. ON TOP OF THAT, NO ONE WANTS THE MESSAGE TO BE WE'RE GOING TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. EVERYTHING IS AWFUL AND THE COMMIT IS TERRIBLE WHEN NONE OF THAT IS TRUE. I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A LOT GOING FOR THEM. THE FIRST ROUND OF POLLS CAME OUT SHOWING THAT THE DEMOCRATIC EDGE IN THE MID-TERMS IS WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR NOW. THEIR LEAD HAS BEEN SLIMMING. THIS ISN'T LOOKING GOOD FOR THEM ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE SO DISORGANIZED. Rick: WHAT DO REPUBLICANS HAVE TO DO? BASICALLY REPUBLICANS HAVE TO FIRE UP THEIR BASE, NOT HACK OFF INDEPENDENT VOTERS, PUT UP GREAT CANDIDATES IN THE OTHER RACES LIKE NORTH DAKOTA. WHAT I WOULDN'T SAY TO REPUBLICANS, IF THEY HOLD THE HOUSE AND MAKE GAINS IN THE SENATE, IT WILL BE BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC ECONOMIC BOON. THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL PLAN. THEY MIGHT NEED TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR MESSAGE. TWO INDEPENDENTS AGREE WITH REPUBLICANS ON AND THEY FIRE UP
