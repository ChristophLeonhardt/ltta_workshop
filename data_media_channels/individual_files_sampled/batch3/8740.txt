YESTERDAY. POLICE SAY THEY DO NOT KNOW THE IDENTITY OF THE SHOOTER AND ONLY HAVE A SKETCH. ERIC: LOOKING PAST THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG-UN, THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS NOW CONFIRMING TO FOX NEWS THAT THEY ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF PLANNING A POTENTIAL FACE-TO-FACE SIT-DOWN BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. THIS OF COURSE COMES AMID SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER'S ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO THE RUSSIAN INFLUENCE AND INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. COME UP IF BOTH OF THESE WORLD LEADERS SIT DOWN TOGETHER. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT IF THIS DOES COME OFF THIS SUMMIT DOES OCCUR? DR. GRANT IS A NATIONAL SECURITY AND MILITARY ANALYST AND ALSO PRESIDENT OF AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH. DR. GRANT, YOU HAVE A TWITTER PHOTO WHICH IS FASCINATING IT SHOWS GORBACHEV AND REAGAN MEETING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 85. YOU WRITE IN IT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT AND IT IS ENTICING TO THINK OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE'S A NEW YORKER. HE'S BLUNT, DIRECT, VERY FRANK. HE'S GOING TO TAKE NO GUFF, YOU KNOW, FROM PUTIN. I THINK HE WOULD SIT RIGHT DIRECTLY AND TELL HIM WHAT HE THINKS. AND HE CAN BE VERY SMOOTH. SO WHAT HAPPENS WITH REAGAN AND GORBACHEV IN GENEVA WAS, YOU KNOW, GORBACHEV WANTED TO TALK ABOUT STAR WARS, REAGAN WANTED TO TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS. IT WENT ON OVER TWO DAYS, AND THERE WERE SHOUTING MATCHES THAT OCCURRED, AND ONE WOULD SAY OH, RANT AND RAVE AND GET UP, BUT IN TEND, THE TWO LEADERS BUT IN THE END, THE TWO LEADERS SET THE PATH TOWARDS ANOTHER THREE SUMMITS AND AN ARMS CONTROL TREATY. SUMMIT IS A GOOD THING. ERIC: I WOULD WORRY IF THEY ARE SHOUTING BUT I GUESS IT TURNED OUT OKAY. IN THIS DAY AND AGE , YOU HAVE SYRIA, INVASION OF UKRAINE, ELECTION INTERFERENCE, ALL THESE ACTIONS AS WELL AS RUSSIAN MEDDLING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, SERGEY LAVROV GOING TO PYONGYANG TO MEET CAN KIM JONG-UN TO GUM UP THE WORKS OF THIS POTENTIAL SUMMIT, WHAT DOES CHANGE IF ANYTHING IN TERMS OF RUSSIAN BEHAVIOR? LET'S ROLL IT BACK. TRUMP MENTIONED IN MARCH THAT HE WAS OPEN TO A SUMMIT WITH PUTIN. PUTIN IS IN A TOUGH SPOT. HIS ECONOMY IS VERY WEAK. IT'S SMALLER GDP THAN CALIFORNIA'S. HE'S BEEN VERY MILITARILY AGGRESSIVE, SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT PUTIN AND TRUMP SHOULD TALK ABOUT. SYRIA IS TOP OF THE LIST, ALSO THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE. AND LET'S NOT FORGET, ERIC, THAT RUSSIA HAS SOME VERY VERY NASTY CYBER CAPABILITIES. THE FBI WARNED US JUST THIS WEEK TO TURN OFF OUR ROUTERS BECAUSE OF A RUSSIAN-LINKED HACKING GROUP. SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT RUSSIA IS DOING TO DESTABILIZE EVERYTHING FROM THE CYBERSPACE TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT. THEY HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. THAT'S WHY I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF SEEING THEM SIT DOWN AND TALK AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. ERIC: WOULD TALKING, WOULD THAT DETER PUTIN'S OBJECTIVES AND THE ACTIONS THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE TAKING AT OUR EXPENSE? I WOULDN'T EXPECT ONE DISCUSSION TO FIX ANYTHING, BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY TRUMP WOULD WANT TO MEET PERSONALLY WITH PUTIN IN A ONE-ON-ONE FORMAT. THEY'VE HAD A COUPLE OF SMALLER THE POTENTIAL IS. LISTEN, AT SOME POINT, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE OUTCOME IN SYRIA. THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND THAT. AND WE'VE SEEN SOME HINTS FROM THE RUSSIAN SIDE THAT THEY MAY WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ARMS CONTROL AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE, AMAZING AS THAT SOUNDS. SO THE AGENDA IS SO BIG THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY APPROPRIATE. I WOULDN'T EXPECT THIS TO CHANGE RUSSIAN BEHAVIOR IMMEDIATELY. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO KEEP UP THAT STRONG MILITARY DETERRENT AND THEN SEE WHAT POSSIBLY WHAT OUTCOME WE COULD LOOK FOR. ERIC: WHAT WOULD YOU SEE IN TERMS OF SYRIA? ASSAD ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE. RIGHT, EXACTLY, BUT THE FACT IS WE CAN'T WITHDRAW COALITION FORCES FROM SYRIA REALLY UNTIL WE SEE SOME DIMINISHING OF RUSSIAN AND IRANIAN ACTIVITY IN THAT SPHERE. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO TALK WITH RUSSIA ON A FREQUENT BASIS ABOUT DECONFLICTING OUR FORCES. DON'T FORGET THAT OUR AIR FORCES FACE THE RUSSIANS ALMOST EVERY DAY. WE HE SEE RUSSIAN JETS TRYING TO MANEUVER AROUND OUR AIR FORCES AND OUR AIR FORCE USUALLY LOCK THEM UP. OKAY? THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. THERE HAS TO BE SOME DISCUSSION THERE. THERE ARE PLENTY OF ISSUES WITH SYRIA TO DISCUSS. ULTIMATELY WE NEED TO SEE RUSSIA CONTAINED. THEY ARE GOING TO BEHAVE BADLY. WE NEED TO CONTAIN THEM. ERIC: WE APPARENTLY STRUCK OUT AND KILLED A BUNCH OF RUSSIAN CONTRACTORS A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN THERE WAS AN ALLEGED ATTACK ON ONE OF OUR BASES. YOU MENTIONED FANCY BEAR, INTELLIGENCE SERVICES THAT ACTUALLY HACKED INTO OUR ELECTION SYSTEM. THEY HACKED INTO THE ILLINOIS ELECTION SYSTEM DURING THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. HERE'S WHAT THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" SAYS ABOUT THAT AND THE RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE. QUOTE, A MEETING THAT WOULD BRING TO THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST ENIGMATIC POLITICAL RELATIONSHIPS, MEETING MR. PUTIN LAST YEAR ON THE SIDE LINES OF THE G 20 SUMMIT MEETING IN GERMANY, MR. TRUMP VOICED CONCERNS ABOUT RUSSIAN INTER CONCERNS ABOUT RUSSIAN INTE INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION. THEN SECRETARY OF STATE TILLERSON SAID AT THE TIME A TWO HOUR MEETING LASTED TWICE AS LONG AS PLANNED DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN PUTIN IS SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU AND SAYS WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. THAT'S NOT US. IT'S ALL PROPAGANDA. HOW DOES IT STOP? THAT'S TYPICAL KGB BEHAVIOR. BUT WE KNOW RUSSIA IS MAKING A STRONG PLAY TO DOMINATE AND ATTACK IN CYBERSPACE JUST AS THEY ARE WITH MILITARY ELECTRONIC WARFARE THAT WE SEE IN SYRIA, UKRAINE AND OTHER PLACES. THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES. IT IS LIKE THE ARMS CONTROL OF THE 80s. NOW CYBERSPACE AND BEHAVIOR IN CYBERSPACE HAS TO BE PART OF THAT VERY CONTENTIOUS DISCUSSION. ERIC: THE ARMS CONTROL OF THE
