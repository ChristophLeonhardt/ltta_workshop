1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,820
This is me.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,360
I'm about to go scuba diving

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,360
for the first time ever.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,020
I went in expecting muffled peace and quiet.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,240
I mean, one of the earliest documentaries
on underwater life was literally called “The

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
Silent World”.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,720
“They roamed deep under the Mediterranean,
the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean, in a mysterious

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,840
realm, a silent world.”

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,600
But as soon as I got down a few yards, I couldn't
help but notice sound all around me.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,700
It was hard to tell what direction it was
coming from, or how far away it was.

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,940
It was coming from boats above me.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,480
As far as I can tell, the Earth’s water
is not as quiet as I thought.

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,000
I’ve been binging this podcast all about
sound, and they've been looking into this too

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,520
"From DeFacto Sound, you’re listening to

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,320
Twenty Thousand Hertz: The stories behind the
world’s most recognizable and interesting

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,100
sounds.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,420
I’m Dallas Taylor."

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,760
So Dallas — life underwater can be pretty
loud, right?

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,420
It can!

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:17,210
Just listen to these toadfish— they oscillate
their swim bladders to make sounds that are

21
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,100
loud enough to keep houseboat residents in
Sausalito, California up at night.

22
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:30,050
Or these Barred Grunt fish, that make a grinding
sound with the teeth in their gullet.

23
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,550
Or these snapping shrimp — they produce a sound by creating

24
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,940
tiny popping bubbles with their claws.

25
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,760
It’s been measured at 200 decibels.

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,520
That’s louder than a gunshot.

27
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,730
Light doesn’t penetrate very deep in water,
so a lot of ocean life has evolved to use

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,410
sound as its primary sense.

29
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:58,190
Because water particles are more densely packed
together than air, sound travels farther and

30
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,420
faster in water.

31
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,140
That makes it an efficient medium of communication
at any depth or time of day.

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,680
“Let's say we had 440, like the middle
key of your piano, or whatever.”

33
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:17,879
That’s John Hildebrand, he’s a professor
at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

34
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,019
He's an expert in the field of underwater
sound and how it’s used by and how it affects

35
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:23,019
marine mammals.

36
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:29,760
“If you looked at the wavelength of that
sound in air, that note, the 440 note, would

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,018
be a little bit less than a meter long.

38
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:38,859
In water, it's more like several meters
long.”

39
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:43,709
What that means is that noise travels about
four times faster and farther in water than

40
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,180
it does in air.

41
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,720
In an experiment in 1991, sound emitted from
Heard Island was picked up at 16 sites in

42
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,720
the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.

43
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,889
It turns out that one of the most common noises
in the entire ocean that can be picked up

44
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:01,160
almost anywhere these days, sounds like this:

45
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,900
It's the sound of boats.

46
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,180
Noise from ship traffic has doubled every
decade since the 1960s.

47
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,740
“Basically, anywhere you go, the ambient
noise in the ocean is dominated by anthropogenic

48
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,240
sound.”

49
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,779
“Let's say I made a measurement 30 years
ago and now if I went to the same place and

50
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:29,629
made the same measurement, it would be 10
dBs or more higher sound level than what I

51
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,819
measured when I started my career.

52
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:32,939
That’s spooky.”

53
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,019
That’s a huge problem for animals that use
sound as their primary sense.

54
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,920
Just listen to this audio of how noise from
a passing boat totally drowns out dolphin

55
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,280
communication.

56
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,000
But arguably the worst culprit of underwater
sound pollution is a process that sounds like this:

57
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,480
This is seismic surveying.

58
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,029
It’s a process that allows companies to
locate spots on the ocean floor where they

59
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,229
can drill for fossil fuels.

60
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,810
Boats with about 30-40 airguns that all go
off at once will move back and forth over large

61
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,460
parts of the ocean.

62
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,110
Bubbles from the horns expand and contract
typically every 10 seconds, creating a huge

63
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,759
amount of acoustic energy that maps geological
structures deep in the ocean floor.

64
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,640
And it’s about as loud as a jet at takeoff.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,120
This can go on for weeks at a time.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,319
A study of seismic survey noise between 1999
and 2009 found that airgun sounds were recorded

67
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:01,069
almost 2500 miles away from the survey ship
itself.

68
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:04,990
At some locations, they were recorded on 80
percent of days for over a year.

69
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,419
And that changes how animals behave.

70
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:11,290
A study by the Institute of Marine Science
at the University of North Carolina found

71
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,139
that reef fish abundance decreased by 78 percent
during seismic surveying.

72
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,840
This is what the reef looked like before seismic
surveying in the area.

73
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,440
And this is what it looked like after.

74
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,400
“Seismic surveying is a constroversial topic at the
coast

75
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
and new research is only adding to the conversation.

76
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,320
“One of those impacted is local fisherman
Jack Cox.

77
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,470
He’s seen firsthand the impact seismic
surveying has on fish.”

78
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,800
“It does something, that — we just don’t catch fish.

79
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,509
For animals like whales — who rely on complex
sound communication systems to socialize,

80
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,650
find food, and mate — that poses a huge
problem.

81
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,480
If you watch this heat map from a study of
endangered North Atlantic right whales, you

82
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,259
can see that shipping paths near Boston squeeze
the whales into a tiny space where communication

83
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,900
is possible — it's about a third of what
it was without the ships.

84
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,689
Susan Parks, a biology professor at Syracuse,
recorded right whale sounds throughout the

85
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:08,040
early 2000s.

86
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,639
And when she compared her audio to some that had
been recorded in 1956, she noticed that the

87
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,760
older sounds were much deeper than her high-pitched
recordings.

88
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,039
It turns out that the whales had started calling
at higher and higher frequencies in order

89
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,080
to hear each other over the hum of ship noise.

90
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,720
Apart from habitat displacement and communication
changes, there’s also evidence that boat

91
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,840
noise simply stresses these whales out.

92
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,419
After the September 11th attacks, researchers
in Canada’s Bay of Fundy compared underwater

93
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,569
noise levels during a period of reduced ship
traffic to the stress-related hormone levels

94
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,289
in the right whale population.

95
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:05,400
They discovered a 6 decibel noise decrease
in the bay after 9/11, which correlated to

96
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,740
lower baseline levels of stress related hormones.

97
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,380
Effects like this go all the way down the
food chain.

98
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,620
A 2017 study found that there were two to
three times more dead zooplankton after after

99
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,310
a day of blasts from a single airgun.

100
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,289
And the larvae of krill, which whales rely
on for food, were totally destroyed.

101
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:28,600
In April 2017, Donald Trump signed an executive
order to open offshore drilling in the Atlantic.

102
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,970
It directed the Interior Department to consider
allowing seismic exploration by 5 companies

103
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,930
that had been blocked under the Obama administration.

104
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,289
It’s getting widespread pushback in Congress
— there’s a bipartisan House bill and

105
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:43,819
Democrat-led Senate bill to ban seismic testing
— but if those authorizations go through,

106
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,199
companies could be conducting seismic testing
in the Atlantic by Fall 2017.

107
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,330
So… is there any good news?

108
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,520
Yes, there is.

109
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,349
In 2014, the International Maritime Organization
adopted guidelines for reducing commercial

110
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:03,569
ship noise levels with things like noise-muffling
propellers and insulated engines — though

111
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,849
they’re not mandatory yet.

112
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:09,819
A year later, the US Navy agreed to limit
sonar testing — which has been linked to

113
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,169
whales stranding themselves on beaches in
habitats near Southern California and Hawaii

114
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:17,050
— following a lawsuit from environmental
groups.

115
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,389
And in June 2016, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration laid out an Ocean

116
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:23,879
Noise Strategy Roadmap.

117
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,669
It’s the start of a 10-year plan to assess
the human impact on underwater sound and the

118
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:32,520
measures required to reduce it.

119
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Seismic surveys can work better, too.

120
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,980
Norway has started multi-client surveys, so
that seismic data from a particular area is

121
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,490
only collected once.

122
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,520
US authorities are considering a similar process.

123
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,030
The ocean is huge.

124
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,800
We’ve explored less than 5 percent of it
so far.

125
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,640
So it’s easy to forget that what we do on
the surface affects everything down below.

126
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,450
But like plastic, chemicals, and waste, noise
pollutes our oceans.

127
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,040
Understanding that is key to doing our part
to protect it.

128
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,920
Thank you so much for watching, we loved doing
this collaboration with Twenty Thousand Hertz.
