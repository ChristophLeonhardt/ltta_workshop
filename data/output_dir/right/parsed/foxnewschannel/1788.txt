HEATHER: WE ARE BACK NOW WITH
FOX NEWS ALERT.
THE WORLD WILL BE WATCHING AS
THE UNITED STATES JOINS ISRAEL
TO WATCH OFFICIAL OPENING.
PASTOR ROBERT JEFFERS IS
DELIVERING THE PRAYER AND JOINS
US NOW FROM JERUSALEM WITH A
PREVIEW OF TODAY'S HISTORIC
CELEBRATION.
GOOD MORNING, PASTOR, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
HEATHER: HUGE DAY, CAN YOU LET
US KNOW A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT YOU
PLAN TO DO, HOW YOU PLAN TO
ADDRESS THIS HISTORIC DAY IN
OPENING PRAYER?
>> HEATHER, I'M GOING TO DO
THREE THINGS IN PRAYER, FIRST OF
ALL, TIME TO THANK GOD FOR HIS
FAITHFULLNESS TO ISRAEL FOR
4,000 YEARS.
YOU KNOW, 4,000 YEARS AGO GOD
SAID TO ABRAHAM THAT HE WOULD
MAKE HIM FATHER TO GREAT NATION
AND ISRAEL HAS BEEN THAT AND GOD
IS SUPER NATURALLY PROTECTED
ISRAEL FROM ALL OF OUR ENEMIES.
I'M GOING TO TAKE TIME TO THANK
FOR GOD, I'M GOING TO THANK GOD
FOR STRONG LEADERSHIP OF
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WHO IS
DETERMINE TODAY PROTECT HIS
PEOPLE AND EXPRESS GRATITUDE FOR
TREMENDOUS PRESIDENT DONALD
TRUMP, YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT I
WAS AT A GATHER WITH PRIME
MINISTER NETANYAHU AND HE SAID
NOBODY ELSE COULD HAVE PULLED
THIS OFF OTHER THAN PRESIDENT
DONALD TRUMP.
WE ARE GOING TO THANK GOD.
HEATHER, I WILL CLOSE WITH
PRAYING WITH PEACE OF JERUSALEM,
MAY ALL WHO LOVE HER PROSPER.
HEATHER: IT IS AMAZING, YOU TALK
ABOUT THE HISTORY THERE, 70
YEARS ISRAEL DECLARED
INDEPENDENCE, JERUSALEM HAS BEEN
THE CAPITAL OF JEWISH PEOPLE FOR
3,000 YEARS.
MANY U.S. PRESIDENTS HAVE
PROMISE TODAY MOVE EMBASSY TO
JERUSALEM.
WE HEARD DAVID LEE MILLER
TALKING ABOUT THAT EARLIER SINCE
1995 HE SAID, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE
BEEN WAITING, IT WAS A QUESTION
OF WHEN THIS WOULD HAPPEN.
ARE YOU SURPRISED IT'S FINALLY
HAPPENING?
>> I AM REALLY NOT SURPRISE
BECAUSE THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE
OF A PROMISE MADE AND PROMISE
KEPT BY PRESIDENT TRUMP.
I KNOW WHEN TALKING TO HIM
BEFORE HE MADE THIS DECISION AND
AFTERWARDS, THIS IS SOMETHING HE
WAS ABSOLUTELY RESLUTE IN DOING.
ONE OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO
SAY IN MY PRAYER, THANK GOD THAT
WE HAVE PRESIDENT HA STANDS IN
RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY AND SIDE
OF GOD.
IT'S TIMED EXACTLY ON THE DAY
THE HOUR THAT 70 YEARS AGO THAT
ISRAEL WAS RECOGNIZED AS A
STATE.
THIS IS HISTORIC FOR TWO REASONS
TODAY.
HEATHER: PASTOR, I DO NEED TO
ASK YOU ABOUT THIS, THERE'S BEEN
PUSHBACK THAT YOU, IN FACT, WERE
CHOSEN TO DELIVER THIS OPENING
PRAYER, SENATE CANDIDATE MITT
ROMNEY OF UTAH AMONGST SOME OF
THOSE PEOPLE, WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY ABOUT CONTROVERSY OR
PUSHBACK?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THESE
WERE COMMENTS RIPPED OUT OF
CONTEXT FROM YEARS AGO,
SECONDLY, HISTORIC CHRISTIANITY
FOR 2,000 YEARS AGO HAS TAUGHT
THAT SALVATION IS THROUGH FAITH
AND CHRIST ALONG AND THE FACT
THAT I CHRISTIANS BELIEVE THAT
SOCIAL SECURITY NOT BIGOTED AND
NOT NEWS WORTHY.
I'M TALKING ABOUT COMMON BONDS
WITH JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY.
EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS ARE MOST
FAITHFUL AND ARDENT SUPPORTERS.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT UNITY AND
NOT DISUNITY.
