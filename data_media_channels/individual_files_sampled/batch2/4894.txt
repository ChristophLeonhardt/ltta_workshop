Mika isn't what David said that we should be hearing from the National Security Advisor who was not in that meeting and should have been in that meeting or or do you want to hear from the interpreter I think it's actually more important to hear from the interpreter because the Russian Foreign Ministry said that the two presidents agreed to something in that meeting and they stand by as ready to implement what that is and we have no idea what the two presidents talked about the National Security Advisor typically does not appear in front of Congress and especially because he wasn't in the room you want to hear from someone who was in the room that's a lower-level executive branch official and Congress is certainly within its rights to call that person what's what are the concerns about what Donald Trump may have said what would be the top most worry for lawmakers mica that Donald Trump may have agreed to behind closed doors with Vladimir Putin well the number one worry for me working with intelligence agencies is that he agreed to putin's proposal that they work hand in glove with the molar investigators or the FBI to understand how exactly US investigators figured out what the russians were up to of course the Russians want to know how we caught them and of course Putin wants to know so they can hide better the next time but that is giving up our sources and methods and deals a tremendous blow to u.s. national security to me if the president agreed to that he's undermining our entire intelligence apparatus John just to remind everybody watching at home what Dan coats the DNI said after Donald Trump had that news conference with Vladimir Putin he released a statement that was not sanctioned by the White House but he released a statement that underscored the intelligence community's assessment of what Russia did during the election here's what he said we have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling a 2016 election and their ongoing repeat ongoing pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security again this is DNI Coates on Monday Donald Trump comes out yesterday tries to correct everything with the change of one word and then today he is asked by reporter if Russia is still meddling he says no his Director of National Intelligence the top intelligence officer in this administration a man he put in that job says no that is not true they are still meddling right now what is DNI codes to John yeah I want to be careful about telling DNI coats what to do but he's in an incredibly bad position but he's also been in a bad position for a long time he oversees the FBI he oversees the CIA he oversees the NSA and the president's been saying amazingly disparaging things about those places for a long time and nary a word from from the DNI so at some point this is what President Trump has done for his entire business career and clearly during his time in the White House is he gets other people involved in his conspiracies he makes them say things that aren't true and then they're sort of stuck and so mr. Coates has a tough position to be in I mean he oversees the intelligence community he probably worries like any good public servant would be that if he leaves a partisan could come in and make things worse but he's gonna have to make a hard decision here is say that that the administration stops working hand-in-hand with the president they do their own thing is it possible to adequately protect our election systems if you don't have buy-in publicly from the president well when I worked in the government we used to talk about an all of government approach and the only way to solve the big problems in this country is when everybody is moving in the same direction and what we have here really is a very bifurcated and crazy system where it seems to be that the executive branch for the most part is doing sensible things and moving forward and the president United States is doing things that border on lunacy and there doesn't seem to be a connection at least is not clear what that connection is so this is a real problem I think and it's going to continue to be a problem as long as Donald Trump does these things and goes out on his own I don't think in fact he probably should have even gone to that summit nonetheless say the things he did afterwards mica is there any way for him to walk this back I mean it would require a total reversal of a number of things but even he's been saying over many years if he's serious about walking us back then he should stop interfering with the Moller investigation he should put more resources against holding the Russians accountable he should be considering fully implementing the sanctions that Congress has put in place but his actions speak louder than his words and his words are all over the place right now hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
