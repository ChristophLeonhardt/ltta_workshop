MISSISSIPPI WORKING HARD TO
DRIVE VOTER TURNOUT.
RONNA McDANIEL CHAIRMAN OF THE
RNC WITH ME NOW.
BEFORE I GET TO THE NEXT RALLY
IN MINNESOTA AND GET A SENSE OF
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE
MID-TERMS, WHAT IS THE
KAVANAUGH ISSUE DOING.
WHAT SORT OF NUMBERS DO THE RNC
HAVE AND SEE ABOUT THE LEVEL OF
INTEREST IN THIS STORY PERHAPS?
>> WELL, DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT THEIR ENERGY
THROUGHOUT THIS PAST TWO YEARS.
IT HAS EXPLODED THE REPUBLICAN
ENERGY.
I THINK A LOT OF REPUBLICANS
ARE LOOKING AT HOW DEMOCRATS
HANDLED THE KAVANAUGH HEARING
HOLDING THESE ALLEGATIONS IN
THEIR BACK POCKET UNTIL THE
11th HOUR.
THE -- THEY'RE FRUSTRATED BY
THE PROCESS.
AS I'M TRAVELING THE COUNTRY IT
IS SOMETHING I HEAR ABOUT QUITE
A BIT.
1 IN 5 VOTERS BASED ON THE
SUPREME COURT, THEIR NUMBER ONE
ISSUE.
>> Bill: I SAW THE POLL WHERE
WOMEN, THEIR SUPPORT FOR HIM
HAS DROPPED 10 POINTS.
DOES THAT LINE UP WITH YOUR
INFORMATION?
>> IT DOES NOT AND I'VE BEEN IN
SEVERAL STATES SINCE THE
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS AND WE'RE
SEEING AN UPTICK WITH WOMEN
ACROSS THE BOARD THAT SUPPORT
THE PRESIDENT.
AND THEIR ENERGY FOR REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATES IS GROWING.
SO WE'RE -- YOU ARE SEEING THE
GENERIC BALLOT NARROW.
I THINK REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING
AT THESE MID-TERMS AND THEY ARE
AWAKE AND NOW THE PRESIDENT
GETTING OUT THERE AND SAYING
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE,
THE RESULTS, THE DEMOCRATS ARE
RESIST AND OBSTRUCT AND THE
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS EXEMPLIFIED
THAT.
WE HAVE TO GET OUT IF WE WANT
TO GET WASHINGTON PRODUCTIVE
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> Bill: BALANCE OF POWER RIGHT
NOW IN THE HOUSE, YOU SEE WHERE
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE
LINED UP.
RONNA, WE HAVE 30 TOSS-UPS ON
OUR MAP RIGHT NOW.
MAYBE THERE IS MORE.
MAYBE THERE ARE LESS OVER THE
NEXT MONTH OR SO.
RIGHT NOW AS OF TODAY WE SEE 30.
FOUR OF WHICH ARE IN MINNESOTA
DISTRICTS 1, 2, 3 AND 8.
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT WILL GO
THERE THREE DAYS FROM NOW.
>> SATURDAY THE PRESIDENT IS
GOING TO GO THERE AND BE IN THE
FIRST DISTRICT, THE OPEN SEAT
THAT WALZ IS VACATING.
>> SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE.
COME ON BACK HERE TO THE MAPS.
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS DIVIDED THE
COUNTRY IN REGIONS.
WE'LL GO TO THE UPPER MIDWEST
IN MINNESOTA AND YOU MENTION
THE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS, 1, 2,
3, 8 ARE TOSS-UPS.
I UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS GOING TO
MINNESOTA AND THE HOUSE BATTLES.
WHY DO YOU FIND YOURSELF
FIGHTING FOR A SENATE SEAT IN
TENNESSEE AND MISSISSIPPI?
WHY IS THAT HAPPENING?
>> WELL, THE PRESIDENT IS
TRAVELING THE WHOLE COUNTRY TO
GET OUT OUR BASE AND HE HAS
ENDORSEED CINDY HYDE-SMITH, A
JUNGLE PRIMARY IN NOVEMBER.
SHE WANTS TO MAKE SURE SHE IS
ONE OF THE TOP TWO.
TWO REPUBLICANS ARE VIABLE AND
ONE DEMOCRAT.
IN MINNESOTA THERE ARE TWO
POTENTIAL FLIPS FOR REPUBLICANS
IN THAT FIRST DISTRICT AND THE
EIGHTH.
THESE ARE SEATS WE CAN PICK UP
AND TAKE BACK FROM THE
DEMOCRATS.
WE'RE GOING ON OFFENSE AND
DEFENSE.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE
PROTECTING OUR MAJORITY IN THE
HOUSE.
THE PRESIDENT IS VERY AWARE
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE LOSE THE
MAJORITY.
NANCY PELOSI BECOMES SPEAKER,
SHE WILL RAISE TAXES AND SHUT
WASHINGTON DOWN AND ALL THAT
WE'VE GAINED, ALL THIS COMEBACK
WILL BE STOPPED IN ITS TRACKS
AND IN THE MID-TERMS THAT FIRST
MID-TERM OF THE SITTING
PRESIDENT WE USUALLY LOSE ON
AVERAGE 30 SEATS.
THE PRESIDENT IS FIGHTING AS
HARD AS HE CAN TO KEEP
EVERYTHING.
HE IS NOT TAKING ANYTHING FOR
GRANTED.
>> Bill: ON THE GENERIC BALLOT
A MONTH AGO IT WAS 12 OR 13
POINTS, NOW IT SUGGESTS 7 OR 8
POINTS.
>> WE'RE SEEING IT NARROW ALSO.
>> Bill: TO WHAT?
>> IT'S DIFFERENT DISTRICT BY
DISTRICT.
CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, VERY
DIFFERENT DISTRICTS IN THOSE
STATES.
I'M SEEING McSALLY DOING WELL
IN ARIZONA, RICK SCOTT IS DOING
WELL IN FLORIDA.
KEVIN KRAMER HAVING A LEAD IN
NORTH DAKOTA.
MIKE BRAUN IN INDIANA.
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US
TO PICK UP SENATE SEATS AND WE
