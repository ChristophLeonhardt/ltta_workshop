you have to be buzzed right now I'm a trained professional but don't try this at home this blue glass is just beautiful I have the coolest job in the world because I started drinking great beer at 8 o'clock this morning and I'm still doing it right so I get paid for this I feel like the Willy Wonka of beer if I can imagine it then I can brew it this is the home of Sam Adams this is our Boston brewery where Sam Adams began 33 years ago and it's where the magic happens there's an old saying that if you finally reveal your ways to half an hour but you teach a man to brew you waste the whole life in my case that's true so this is where we make beer making beer is about as complicated as making Bradham and it's very similar my great-great grandfather could walk into this brewery and know exactly what everything does we're in the same anims barrel room and in here we make a few special sort of ingredients that we add into other beers and we call it cosmic mother funk kmf for short now I'm going to take you back into the secret hidden part of this brewery this is not on the tour this is the nanobrewery this is kind of the most Willy Wonka as part of our brewery and there's kind of secret stuff going on in here so you can't film everything 20 different experimental beers on tap maybe none of them will actually you know get to the market so this may be the only place in the world you'll get to try them it's interesting there used to be this really annoying joke about why is American beer like making love in a canoe and of course the punchline is because it's close to water now that annoyed me as an American Brewer and I realized I could make great world-class beer give it to people fresh and that would open up their taste buds to something new and different and I think that helped create this whole craft beer revolution cheers to drinking on the job
