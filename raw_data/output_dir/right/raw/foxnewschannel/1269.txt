SUMMI

3
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:09,194
SUMMIT IS ON OR OFF.

4
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:10,996
>> Sean: AND JOINING US A FOX

5
00:00:10,996 --> 00:00:13,164
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR DANIEL HOFFMAN

6
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:13,565
IS WITH US.

7
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:16,367
I LOVE THE WAY THE PRESIDENT

8
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:17,602
STATES IT.

9
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:19,638
MISSILES NOT FIRED OVER JAPAN,

10
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:21,806
GUAM'S NOT IN JEOPARDY, THE

11
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:23,808
KOREAN PENINSULA IS MORE SAFE

12
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:27,712
AND HOSTAGES RELEASED, TRUMP

13
00:00:27,712 --> 00:00:29,948
PULLS OUT THEY BEG, NO, NO, NO,

14
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:30,982
PLEASE, PLEASE.

15
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:32,584
NO DOWN SIDE AND WE DIDN'T PAY

16
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:34,686
CASH THIS TIME, DID WE?

17
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:36,488
>> IT'S QUITE A CONTRAST FROM

18
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:38,089
WHAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

19
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:43,762
GAVE UP TO GET BERGDAHL BACK

20
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:47,465
FROM SOME BAD TERRORISTS.

21
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:50,735
WHAT I'D HIGHLIGHT IN THE

22
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:52,170
MEETING BETWEEN SECRETARY POMPEO

23
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,208
AND THE FEWER-STAR GENERAL

24
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,510
FORMER HEAD OF MILITARY

25
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,348
INTELLIGENCE AND REFLECTS THE

26
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:04,748
SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH KIM

27
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:09,588
JONG-UN IS APPROACHING THE

28
00:01:09,588 --> 00:01:09,921
SUMMIT.

29
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:13,491
AND KIM JONG-UN HAS BEEN

30
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,026
TARGETED FOR RESPONSIBLE FOR

31
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:18,129
KILLING 46 SOUTH KOREAN SAILORS

32
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,931
IN 2010 BUT THIS IS THE HAND

33
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:22,033
WE'RE DEALT WITH AND PART OF THE

34
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:25,070
CHALLENGE OF DEALING WITH A

35
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,838
HERMIT KINGDOM AND THE

36
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:28,573
NEGOTIATIONS THAT WILL HAVE TO

37
00:01:28,573 --> 00:01:30,875
TAKE PLACE WITH UNSAVORY

38
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:31,276
CHARACTERS.

39
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:32,277
>> Sean: I LOVE THE FACT THAT

40
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:34,546
ALL THESE BIG DEVELOPMENTS HAVE

41
00:01:34,546 --> 00:01:34,913
HAPPENED.

42
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:35,981
THE PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN UP

43
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:36,314
NOTHING.

44
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:39,818
I THINK THE FACT THAT THE MEDIA

45
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:41,386
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND, THIS IS THE

46
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:42,220
ART OF THE DEAL.

47
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,722
THIS IS HOW YOU NEGOTIATE.

48
00:01:43,722 --> 00:01:45,724
MAYBE IT HAPPENS ON THE 12th.

49
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:47,492
MAYBE IT DOESN'T.

50
00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:51,329
MAYBE IT TAKES ONE MEETING, TWO

51
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,815
MEETINGS, PLEA

52
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:54,065
MEETINGS, PLE

53
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:54,099
MEETINGS, THE

54
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:54,132
MEETINGS, THRE

55
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:54,165
MEETINGS, THREE

56
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:54,199
MEETINGS, THREE M

57
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:54,232
MEETINGS, THREE MAY

58
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:54,366
MEETINGS, THREE MAYBE

59
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:54,399
MEETINGS, THREE MAYBE M

60
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:54,432
MEETINGS, THREE MAYBE MOR

61
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,766
MEETINGS, THREE MAYBE MORE.

62
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:58,003
IT'S WORTH IT FOR NOT ON THE

63
00:01:58,003 --> 00:01:58,503
COUNTRY BUT WORLD.

64
00:01:58,503 --> 00:02:01,873
AND SO MUCH PROGRESS I THINK

65
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:05,176
KRISTIN IS RIGHT, WE DIDN'T

66
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:06,378
ANTICIPATES SIX MONTHS AGO.

67
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:08,346
>> I THINK NORTH KOREA TRIED TO

68
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:10,414
PRACTICE THE ART OF BRINKMANSHIP

69
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:11,850
AND THE PRESIDENT WALKED AWAY

70
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,687
AND INJURY KOREA CAME BACK WITH

71
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:17,722
A BELLICOSE MESSAGE INDICATING

72
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,057
THEY WERE SERIOUS IN TALKING TO

73
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:19,924
US.

74
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:22,727
IT WILL BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY

75
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:24,629
COMPLEX SERIES OF NEGOTIATIONS.

76
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,768
RUSSIA IS ALREADY INTERFERING

77
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,870
WITH TALK OF RATCHETING DOWN THE

78
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,071
SANCTIONS WHICH IS NOT HELPFUL

79
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:34,939
BUT I THINK WE'RE PLAYING OUR

80
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:37,909
HAND AS AS WELL AS WE POSSIBLY

81
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:38,843
COULD.

82
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:40,412
I WOULDN'T EXPECT IMMEDIATE

83
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:43,148
GRATIFICATION BUT WE'RE SHOWING

84
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:45,850
THE NORTH KOREANS WE MEAN

85
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,385
BUSINESS AND THE PATTERN WE

86
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:49,054
FOLLOW SHOWING STRENGTH TO NORTH

87
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:50,522
KOREA CLEARLY HAS BEEN MORE

88
00:02:50,522 --> 00:02:51,623
EFFECTIVE THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN

89
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:53,058
FROM THE PAST TWO DECADES.

90
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:54,225
>> Sean: AND THE PRESIDENT I

91
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:56,194
THINK RIGHTLY SO MANAGING

92
00:02:56,194 --> 00:02:58,263
EXPECTATIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT

93
00:02:58,263 --> 00:02:58,797
THE SHOULD EXPECT.

94
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:02,267
IF IT HAPPENS, OR DOESN'T

95
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:03,301
MAPPEN.

96
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:04,669
-- HAPPEN THE BALL WILL BE IN

97
00:03:04,669 --> 00:00:00,000
THEIR COURT AND IT WILL BE ABOUT
