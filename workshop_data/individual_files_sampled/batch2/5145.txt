Michael Cohen reportedly has a story to tell NBC News has confirmed Cohen is willing to inform Robert Muller that Donald Trump as a candidate knew about that 2016 meeting between Russians and his top campaign aides at Trump Tower a knowledgeable source says the president's former attorney is willing to tell the special counsel that Donald Trump jr. told his father in advance of the meeting Cohen's claims first were reported last night by CNN whose sources say Cohen does not have evidence to back up his story CNN also reporting a source familiar with Cohn's testimony to the House Intelligence Committee says Cohen did not testify that Trump had advanced knowledge nor does that claim appear in either of the committees reports Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis declined comment but reportedly told CNN I have to wonder why the Trump people put that story out it was not from US president Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani had this to say I expected something like this from Co he's been lying all week I mean or for - he's been alive for years I don't see how he has any credibility of it this is basically he had a trial and there won't be a trial here but if he had a trial you'd say well why do you want to pick you want to pick the first lie the second lie or maybe some new life there's nobody that I know that knows him that hasn't warned me that if he's back he's up against the wall he'll he'll I like crazy because he's alive all his life all right so Emily Jane Fox let's talk about Donald Trump I think it's the same exact sound like if you took those words in the platinum the president United States you'd be like that sounds like a let's let's talk about what Julian was talking about in that case though that was talking about Michael Cohen there Emily it is true according to CNN that Michael Cohen does not have evidence of his claim here it is true that it does not appear in either of the reports that came out of the house Intel committee Cohen also testified last year before the Senate Intel committee so he didn't bring up this this allegation there either according to your reporting is he willing to present some evidence that he knew that Donald Trump knew in advance about this meeting I poured it on Monday that people in Cohen world had said that he had information that Robert Muller and his investigation would be interested in and three people at that time told me that some of that had to do with that Trump Tower meeting so this has been something that been in the air and in the orbit that talked about in Cohen world is my sense that there is not necessarily a smoking gun a piece of evidence that the government had collected from his apartment hotel room and hotel and office but that doesn't mean that he's not able to provide context there were other people in the room Rudy Giuliani denied last night on CNN that the other people in the room had said that but the real issue here is that there are credibility issues on both sides we know that Rudy Giuliani was untruthful on Friday when describing the audio recording that was released he said it was completely exculpatory that it was the president who brought up paying with the check and I think it's pretty clear from the audio from the audio recording that we've heard now that that is not what Michael Cohen and the president had talked about in that conversation and so it's hard to know who was telling the truth but I think what is clear is that Michael Cohen believes he has a lot to offer prosecutors but the fact that this came out limits his ability to do so he this is not a great day for Michael Cohen and people in his orbit are frustrated and furious and feel like this is not what they wanted to have happen and this is not how they wanted this to play out and it is true Michael Smith that this report comes out at a time when Cohen does feel like his backs up against the wall when he has taken a more aggressive stand hiring lanny davis putting lenny davis out on TV providing those tapes to CNN of course and that perhaps this piece of information that cohen says he's willing to provide to robert muller would get him out of trouble elsewhere yeah so he has two problems with the Jessup arm he has a New York problem in a Washington problem and what he wants to do is he wants to use anything he has to offer to solve both of them so could he make a global deal with the Justice Department could he sit down and say look I know Muller is interested in this I know the guys in New York want to know this here's my exposure can I do that you need a very skilled lawyer to do that and the Justice marmer is gonna Fran I think upon this continued public discussion that has gone on with these lawyers with Lani out there discussing things the way that he has I'm not sure how this has helped Michael Cohen I'm just not sure what's clear Donnie is that were a long way from I would take a bullet Donald Trump in terms of where Michael Cohen's head is right now yeah and his stance toward the president the United States we're about as far away from that as you can possibly get and to jump off of L Emily's point also Michael in my past conversation with Michael what Michael has been very clear to me is number one and there's a man he worked for for over a decade nothing went on in this business without knowing about it and he had led me to believe that he could bring Trump back to Russia that he what came out yesterday to me was not a surprise based on conversations Michael and I had had that without a specific piece of paper that there were he not only uses exact words but that everything that was going on Trump knew about did he reference this meeting and particularly as he talked to him as he did and this was several months ago and maybe somebody else was even in the room and that happened and that discussion happened so I this is what it's gonna come down to and I I think Michael at Emily's point also is frustrated because other than one or two of the statements he's made he really by his lawyers advised him by his friends advice his understood it's time to be quiet what's happening is he's kind of being pulled out and he's very caught in between I know I've gotta lay low I know I've got to wait for my day in court literally and figuratively but I got to punch back once in a while and there's this constant battle frankly between Lonnie and his attorneys how hard his attorneys obviously saying to nothing right and so there's the kind of emotional daily rollercoaster of how he does it I also think attach this wouldn't get this later in the show the biggest story of yesterday a probably last month is Weisenberger the CFO that Emily also brought up organizations for the Trump that and I've said this from the beginning this is going to come back to 15 years or 20 years or 30 years of slimy dishonest underhanded business dealings and you can connect that with Russia and everything else and I think they're gonna be things that come out we have anything for Michael's got a piece on that we'll talk about it just this isn't the first time we've heard this assertion from someone who knows Donald Trump really well Steve Danon in Michael Wolf's book asserted this nestea Dan was not actually in the Trump campaign in the pin the new relevant time frame so he was his his comments about the sourcing of speculation inform speculation and retroactively inform speculation but it's gonna come to us another person super close to Donald Trump who basically is either has direct knowledge or is claiming to have direct knowledge or believes what a lot of us believe is that a meeting of this importance held by Don Jr would not be something that would not have been reported to his father I think that that rings true to a lot of people the question I have for you Emily is this you were early ahead of everybody on the notion that when the information came out that there was a tape that it was not Michael Cohen would have put that out that it was the Trump side that was some of you were way ahead on the suggestion is again is that that's happening now again that this is a Michael Kona put this out but somehow this is being put out by Donald Trump side I understood in the first instance why the Trump people would have wanted to get a head of tape of a tape and try to contextualize it try to spin it try to set it up they knew was going to come out anyway what is a do you think this is the Trump people for sure who put this out number one and number two this new information and number two this is different there's not a tape to contextualise what does the Trump side have to gain in this one this particular claim if it's uncorroborated there's no actual factual basis there's no piece of evidence he has why would the Trump people do that if it is in fact the Trump people who've done it I'll tell you what the Kohen orbit believes about this because I think that the waters here are so muddy and it's so hard to understand anyone's motivation in any of this and I think you could probably argue both sides but in Cohen worlds the discussion is how does this serve us for this to be out here there was absolutely no benefit for Michael Cohen he is not seeking a pardon from everything I know in my reporting that is not something he's interested in not something he's looking for so he's not sending a smoke signal there this could potentially hinder his ability to cooperate with with prosecutors if they feel like a card has been taken from his deck and he doesn't have as much to offer him now the Trump motivation look Michael Cohen was very vocal in his Stephanopoulos interview and on in on ABC a few weeks ago there were two things that stuck out to from that interview there was one the fact that he that Stephanopoulos knew to ask about payments to women which now came out in the recording and Stephanopoulos knew to ask about trumped our meeting and at the time I had said it's interesting that those two things were asked about I don't think that that was an accident so Rudy Giuliani and the legal team had sort of a preview of two cards in Michael Cohen's deck and so it's possible that because they knew that those were two things that were on Michael Cohen's mind because there was maybe this meeting that happened and people in Trump's orbit maybe were in that meeting in Trump Tower that they're trying to get ahead of two things that Michael Cohen had signaled he was willing to talk to investigators yeah Michael Cohen's reporter claims are true and again there's no evidence yet presented to that effect that Donald Trump jr. told his father in advance of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians it would contradict claims from Trump and his son after the New York Times broke this story one year ago a lot of people gonna want to know this about your father hmm did you tell your father anything about that oh all right it was such a nothing there was nothing to tell I mean I wouldn't have even remembered it until we start scouring through the stuff did you know I didn't know anything about it you think it must have been a very important must have been a very unimportant meeting cuz I never even heard like a very important we do so there we have a piece of Michael Schmidt's conversation with the president and Maggie Haberman da he's colleague but Heidi preserve all I want to go to you first on the the Congressional side of this because they're saying that you know this never came up in the House Intelligence meeting is it possible that that Donald Trump jr. lied to Congress it's possible we don't know exactly because we don't have those transcripts but I will note a very important timeline in this in terms of who's going to be able to who's going to be questioned additionally about this in terms of Don junior what he knew and also Paul Manafort and what he knew what we know is that Don junior made two calls around this meeting to a blocked number which was the modem operandi for him calling his father to a block number one was before one was after we also know from movements outside and inside Trump Tower that Trump was physically present during that meeting and we know that within hours afterwards he was meeting up with Paul manna for at a luncheon just down the street so there would have been every opportunity for the president to have been briefed and again to take you back to Steve Benin's remarks in the book it is incredulous to believe that the president hadn't been debriefed so I think where this becomes important if they're going to try and discredit Michael Cohen is to look for corroboration from others who would have known and of course if Don jr. told Fox News you know that may that may be you know come out as a lie I just want to go back to the line that John Holliman quoted from Steve ban in the Michael Wolf book fire and feared he called that trump tower meeting treasonous did Bannen he went on to say the chance that Don Jr did not walk the Russians up to his father's office on the 26th floor is zero now that doesn't suggest that he knew about it beforehand but it does suggest that he may have known about it thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of
