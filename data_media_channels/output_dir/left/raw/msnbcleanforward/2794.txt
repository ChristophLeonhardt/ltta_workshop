IT CONFIRMED WHAT I BELIEVED

18
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:31,030
IT CONFIRMED WHAT I BELIEVED
ABOUT JIM COMEY WHICH WAS IS

19
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:33,432
ABOUT JIM COMEY WHICH WAS IS
THAT HE WASNT RATING OUT OF A

20
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:37,003
THAT HE WASNT RATING OUT OF A

21
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,204
POLITICAL BIAS BUT HE HAD A
DANGEROUS CORRUPTING BELIEF THAT

22
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:39,872
DANGEROUS CORRUPTING BELIEF THAT
BECAUSE HE WASNT MOTIVATED

23
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,374
BECAUSE HE WASNT MOTIVATED
BIPARTISANSHIP THAT HE COULD USE

24
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:43,075
BIPARTISANSHIP THAT HE COULD USE
HIS OWN JUDGMENT TO DECIDE WHAT

25
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:43,743
HIS OWN JUDGMENT TO DECIDE WHAT
ACTIONS WERE RIGHT TO TAKE.

26
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,312
ACTIONS WERE RIGHT TO TAKE.

27
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:48,448
AND THAT LED HIM TO ACT WELL
BEYOND HIS ROLE AS THE FBILL

28
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:48,781
BEYOND HIS ROLE AS THE FBI
FACTOR.

29
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,449
FACTOR.

30
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:51,050

>> JENNIFER PALMIERI, LET ME ASK
YOU THIS, THOUGH, CAN YOU SAYASK

E-MAIL INVESTIGATION OR
MISHANDLED THE CLOSING OF THE

E-MAIL INVESTIGATION?

124
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:36,816
AND I THINK THATS AN IMPORTANT
DISTINCTION THATS AN IMPORTANT

125
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,416
DISTINCTION
DISTINCTION?

126
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,350
DISTINCTION?
>> IT IS.

127
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:39,585
>> IT IS.
I AULTS ALWAYS THOUGHT WHEN THE

128
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,987
I AULTS ALWAYS THOUGHT WHEN THE
FBI WAS GOING THROUGH THEIR

129
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,588
FBI WAS GOING THROUGH THEIR
INVESTIGATION OF HER THAT IT

130
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:46,425
INVESTIGATION OF HER THAT IT
WOULD END THE WAY THAT IT DID.

131
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,227
WOULD END THE WAY THAT IT DID.
THAT IT WOULD CONCLUDE WITHOUT

132
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,695
THAT IT WOULD CONCLUDE WITHOUT
THEM PURSUING THE CASE FURTHER

133
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:53,399
THEM PURSUING THE CASE FURTHER
AND I THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE

134
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:55,000
AND I THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE
FAIR IN HOW THEY WENT ABOUT THAT

135
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:55,468
FAIR IN HOW THEY WENT ABOUT THAT
IMPORTANT WORK.

136
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,102
IMPORTANT WORK.

137
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:56,736
AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED.

138
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:57,436
AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED.

139
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:58,103
BUT IT DOES SHOW TO ME THAT

140
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:01,507
BUT IT DOES SHOW TO ME THAT

141
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,709
THE -- YOU KNOW, THERE IS A --
THERE IS A CORRUPTING BELIEF--

142
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,277
THERE IS A CORRUPTING BELIEF
THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT

143
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,645
THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT
PARTISAN OR POLITICAL PEOPLE

144
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:08,581
PARTISAN OR POLITICAL PEOPLE
LIKE YOU KNOW I WAS -- RIGHT?

145
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:11,483
LIKE YOU KNOW I WAS -- RIGHT?
I WAS A POLITICAL APPOINTEE.

146
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:11,851
I WAS A POLITICAL APPOINTEE.
>> RIGHT.

147
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,286
>> RIGHT.

148
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,887
>> THAT THEY ARE SOMEHOW

149
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,454
>> THAT THEY ARE SOMEHOW

150
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:16,021
ABOVE -- NOT THE LAW.

151
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:16,755
ABOVE -- NOT THE LAW.

152
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:17,490
BUT THEY ARE ABOVE REPROACH WHEN

153
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,559
BUT THEY ARE ABOVE REPROACH WHEN

154
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:20,792
IT COMES TO TAKING ACTIONS THAT
THEY JUDGE TO BE RIGHT EVENTHAT

155
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,061
THEY JUDGE TO BE RIGHT EVEN
THOUGH THEY ARE NOT THEIR ROLE.

156
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,729
THOUGH THEY ARE NOT THEIR ROLE.
WHAT IS REALLY IRONIC IS THAT

157
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:25,832
WHAT IS REALLY IRONIC IS THAT
THE FBI WAS ISOLATED, RIGHT, IT

158
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,366
THE FBI WAS ISOLATED, RIGHT, IT
WAS PUT INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF

159
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,836
WAS PUT INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE, WHICH IS ALSO SOMEWHAT

160
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:30,535
JUSTICE, WHICH IS ALSO SOMEWHAT
ISOLATED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

161
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:31,604
ISOLATED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

162
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:32,338
FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING IT

163
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:33,238
FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING IT

164

FROM POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS.

165
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,842
FROM POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS.

166
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,475
IT WAS VERY MUCH POLITICAL

167
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:37,142
IT WAS VERY MUCH POLITICAL

168
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:37,810
CONSIDERATIONS THAT LED JIM
