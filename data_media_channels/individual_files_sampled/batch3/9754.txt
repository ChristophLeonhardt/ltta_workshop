HEATHER: WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING PRESIDENT TRUMP SITTING DOWN WITH TOP SINGAPORE OFFICIALS. IN JUST HOURS HE WILL COME FACE TO FACE WITH NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR. AS THE MEETING DRAWS CLOSER, WHO CAN WE EXPECT TO PLAY A KEY ROLE BOTH IN AND OUTSIDE THE ROOM, NORTH KOREAN ANALYST AND AUTHOR OF NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN, NORTH KOREA TAKES OVER THE WORLD GORDON CHANG, GORDON, WE ALWAYS LOVE IT WHEN YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE YOUR LEVEL OF EXPERTISE OUTPACE YES, IT GOES ABOVE EVERYBODY, DEFINITELY ABOVE MINE. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHO IS IN THE ROOM FIRST. WE HAVE SECRETARY MIKE POMPEO, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON AND AMBASSADOR TO PHILIPPINES WHO IS ALSO FORMER AMBASSADOR TO SOUTH KOREA AND HAVE BEEN LEADING ONE OF THE TEAMS TALKING TO NORTH KOREANS. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRIDGE THE GAP ON POSITION, BUT SON KIM HAS BEEN A KEY PLAYER THERE. HEATHER: A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF THE SUMMIT? WE HAD TEAMS IN DMZ IN SINGAPORE AND LOGISTICS AND KIM YONG-CHOL AND ON JUNE 1ST, KIM YONG-CHOL MET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP IN OVAL OFFICE BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S CRUCIAL. HEATHER: OBVIOUSLY IT DIDN'T STOP THE SUMMIT FROM HAPPENING, WE KNOW THAT MUCH. IT'S SIGNIFICANT TO POINT OUT WHO IS NOT IN THE ROOM. THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT. CHINESE LEADER XI JINPING AND MOON JAE-IN AND OUR GOOD ALLY SHINZO ABE, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER WHO WAS IN OVAL OFFICE ON THURSDAY BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO BE IN SINGAPORE EITHER. THOSE THREE FIGURES SHAPE THE WAY THINGS WILL TRANSPIRE GOING FORWARD. HEATHER: WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE NOT THE ROOM AND TALK ABOUT TIG SIGNIFICANCE AND FLYING ON CHINA AIR. HE'S BASICALLY SAYING HE'S OUR GUY. DON'T MESS WITH HIM. THAT'S A MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. FOR US, XI JINPING HAS BEEN A MALIGN INFLUENCE. OVER LAST 3 MONTHS OR SO THEY HAVE BEEN BUSTING SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT OPENLY. THAT'S REALLY A WARNING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. NOW, WE CAN IGNORE THAT, HEATHER, IF THINGS GO WELL WITH NORTH KOREA BUT IF THEY DON'T IT'S BECAUSE OF CHINA'S INFLUENCE. WE HAVE TO IMPOSE COST ON BEIJING FOR MESSING UP THE SUMMIT. HEATHER: HOW DO YOU THINK THE SUMMIT IS GOING TO GO? I HOPE WE GET A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM NORTH KOREANS TO DISMANTLE NUCLEAR WEAPON'S PROGRAM BUT CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT WAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO HAVE BEEN LOWERING EXPECTATIONS SAYING IT'S REALLY A MEET AND GREET, THE FIRST OF THE BEGINNING OF SUMMITS AN LONG PROCESS. HEATHER: WE HEARD THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO INVITE KIM JONG UN TO MAR-A-LAGO, WE HEARD THAT KIM JONG UN HAS PERSONALLY INVITED PRESIDENT TRUMP TO COME TO PYONGYANG, SO OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE ANTICIPATING THIS AND MOVING FORWARD? CERTAINLY. ONE THING THAT KIM JONG UN WANTS LEGITIMIZATION. HEATHER: I WANTED TO ASK YOU THAT. THEY'LL BE SHOWING THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS AS LONG AS KIM JONG UN IS THE RULER. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT THING. NOW WE'VE GIVEN THAT UP. WE HAVE TO GET SOMETHING IN RETURN. QUESTION, ARE WE GOING TO GET THAT NOW OR ARE WE GOING TO GET IT LATER. IF WE GET IT LATER, THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'VE HANDED HIM A VICTORY WHICH MEANS WE NOW HAVE LESS LEVERAGE BECAUSE HE WANTS LESS FROM US. FOR US, THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY TRICKY VERY INTRICATE DANCE NOT ONLY WITH NORTH KOREANS BUT ALSO WITH THE CHINESE AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT MOON JAE-IN BECAUSE HE'S BEEN SUPPORTING KIM JONG UN. WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND ON OUR SIDE OF THE FENCE WE HAVE THE JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER. HEATHER: YEAH, ALL RIGHT. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS FOR SURE. WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN
