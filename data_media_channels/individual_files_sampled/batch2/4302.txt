I would let the senators take their course let the Senators do it they do it a very good job they've given tremendous amounts of time they've already postponed a major hearing and really they're hurting somebody's life very badly and it's very unfair I think to as you know justice Cavanaugh has been treated very very tough and his family I think it's a very unfair thing what's going on so we'll see but I do think this they've given it a lot of time they will continue to give it a lot of time and really it's up to the Senate and I really rely on them I think they're going to do a good job I really want to see her I really would want to see what she has to say but I want to give it all the time they need they've already given it time they've delayed a major hearing there's no more just a back look when I first decided to run everybody said the single most important thing you do is the Supreme Court justice okay we've all heard that many times about a president I would say this I think he's an extraordinary man I think he's a man of great intellect as I've been telling you and he's has an unblemished record this is a very tough thing for him and his family and we want to get it over with at the same time we want to give tremendous amounts of time if she shows up that would be wonderful if she doesn't show up that would be unfortunate hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
