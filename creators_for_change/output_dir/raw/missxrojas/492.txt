00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
I am stress as per usual because I can't

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,470
I just can't I can't do everything that

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,210
I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do which means that i'm very</font>

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">behind on everything that just makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,500
remember anxious the<font color="#E5E5E5"> natural way of</font>

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,660
fixing this is by making YouTube video

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,790
about it I feel I'm going to address a

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,680
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read comments I</font>

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,940
know that I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best person in the</font>

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,439
world it replied in my comments gets

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,570
really funny because you recall it and

12
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,490
every northern people like he's gained

13
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,010
weight you've lost weight you've slimmed

14
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,800
down well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should lay off the cake</font>

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,560
it's just like um angles it's all about

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,870
angles right now this is on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> window so</font>

17
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,730
purely for comfort and four lights safe

18
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,739
but it does mean that it's elevated so

19
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,629
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see my face from above</font>

20
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,309
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna make it look skinnier</font>

21
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,590
back at<font color="#E5E5E5"> University where largely I would</font>

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,469
film from like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight-on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective</font>

23
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,329
that would be my veins it's not a

24
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,520
natural like slimming down suddenly

25
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,160
putting on weight and also just bugger

27
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,780
get that off my chest because it's kind

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">of in my brain every time I make a video</font>

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,590
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't am I deceiving people</font>

30
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,739
by having this video by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> light and</font>

31
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,570
therefore having it from above am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

32
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,130
giving people like a false image of

33
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,780
myself but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shoot videos of</font>

34
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily a false image of yourself</font>
