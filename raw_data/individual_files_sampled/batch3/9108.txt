ON FOOD STAMPS. DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO TAKE IT DOWN. MIKE TELLS US WHERE THINGS STAND. THE HOUSE WILL DEBATE A 5 YEAR BILL TO REQUIRE ABLE-BODIED ADULTS TO WORK TO COLLECT FOOD STAMPS. WE LOVE OUR FARMERS. WHILE THERE WAS A HINT OF A VETO THREAT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, THE WHITE AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SAID THE PRESIDENT IS ON BOARD. THE LAST TIME UNEMPLOYMENT WAS 3.9% IN 2000 THERE WERE 17 MILLION PEOPLE ON FOOD STAMPS. TODAY THERE ARE 41 MILLION PEOPLE ON THE PROGRAM. DEMOCRATS CALL THIS THE MOST PARTISAN FARM BILL IN 20 YEARS AND WARN ABOUT HITTING THE PROGRAM WITH A SLEDGE HAM PROGRAM WITH A SLEDGE HA PROGRAM WITH A SLEDGEHAA PROGRAM WITH A SLEDGEHAMM PROGRAM WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER PROGRAM WITH A SLEDGEHAMME PROGRAM WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER PROGRAM WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER. LET'S COME TO THE TABLE AND STAMP OUT FRAUD THAT WON'T DO A DISSERVICE TO THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM TO FIGHT HUNGER. WITH TOUGHER WORK REQUIREMENT, GOP LEADERS SAY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE WILL VOTE NO. THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY WE CAN SUPPORT THIS BILL. ANOTHER SENSITIVE SUBJECT IS THE SUGAR PROGRAM WITH IMPORT RESTRICTIONS AND FLOOR PRICE THAT RESULTS IN MORE EXPENSIVE SUGAR. THE SUGAR PROGRAM NEEDS REFORMING. WHAT I AM MOST INTERESTED IS IN IS GETTING A FARM BILL PASSED INTO LAW. THAT'S A REFERENCE TO THE CONCERN THAT A SUGAR AMENDMENT COULD BE A POISON PILL.
