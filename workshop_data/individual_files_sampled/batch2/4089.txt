we have some breaking news to report out of Muenster Germany for all of you that's where police say the driver has plowed into a vehicle plowed with a vehicle rather into a crowd killing several people leaving at least 30 people injured let's go right to Embassy's Tammy Lightner she's following all the latest from London for us so what can you tell us about this incident Tammy hey Alex at this point police are not ruling out a terrorist attack we now know that police in Munster Germany have confirmed as you mentioned 30 people are injured local media reporting as many as 50 people injured we're still working on getting that number confirmed police are saying their deaths but not giving us numbers exactly how many people were killed we know that at some point someone drove a vehicle into a crowd of people it appears to have been in the old town area of that city police obviously warning locals to avoid that area this happened around 327 local time we do know the suspect is dead police confirmed he took his own life pictures you are seeing right now on the screen show panic people trying to help the injured heavy police presence tables and scare chairs scattered where the drove into that area and keep in mind it's been one year since the terrorist attack in in Stockholm if you recall a man drove a hijacked truck into a crowded shopping street and into a store eventually five people died and 14 people were injured so Europe is obviously on edge from these attacks Muenster Alex we know is a cosmopolitan city it's in the western part of Germany it's a historic town a university town it's known for its quality of life there there's about 300,000 people that live in that town 55,000 of them are students and Alex were just getting reports also that there is a suspicious item that was found in the vehicle the bomb squad is on the scene they're obviously very cautiously approaching approaching that vehicle they can't be too careful because they don't know what it is at this point will be monitoring the scene and we'll get back to you with any developments Alex you know can't be you bring up what happened in Stockholm immediately comes to mind what happened in Nice France went after the Bastille Day celebrate I mean they were if my memory serves correctly more than 80 people killed by a truck there right along the Promenade and nice there was the Las Ramblas attack in Barcelona that was just last summer I'm thinking the Westminster Bridge London I mean this is horrifyingly similar to this that just using a car as a lethal weapon but with regard to this suspect you say he's dead is there any understanding of how he killed himself was a gun was it a bomb we haven't heard anything about an explosive device right no nothing is clear at this point about how he cleared or how he killed himself how he took his own life and as you mentioned obviously when we hear about these attacks which have become all too common obviously our first thought now goes to terrorist attack because we are hearing about these over and over and over they've become common throughout Europe and so it's still unclear at this point although that's obviously the first thing that police also assume and that they have to start looking into is this a terrorist attack but as you asked it's still unclear at this point how the suspect took his own life hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
