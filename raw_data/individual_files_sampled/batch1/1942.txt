in France the majority of fatal motor vehicle accidents happen on roads like these in Normandy often scenic secondary routes across the countryside connecting towns and villages to try and save lives the government's lowered the speed limit from 90 to 80 km/h but most drivers in France are against the change going to annoy people the extra fines our money making scheme I'd have preferred keeping the 90 limit I think it's useless because a collision at 80 or 90 is probably equally violent personally I think it's just another limit on us there have been protests against the new speed limit across the country motorbike riders say it'll curb their enjoyment of the open road and three-quarters of French people say it's an erosion of their rights almost 3,700 people died in road accidents in France last year a quarter of a million were injured roads like this are particularly dangerous they're often lined with trees visibility isn't great and because there are no central reservation areas it means that when drivers are overtaking they're speeding into oncoming traffic no burpee Hall is lucky to be alive eight years ago a lorry hit his motorbike he spent three years in hospital and now walks with a cane today he raises awareness about road safety he says lowering the speed limit is a step but it's not enough it would have been more popular yes it will save lives but there would be more errors so people think it's about making money it's not just about limits we want a proper Road police the Prime Minister says the new limit could save up to 400 lives a year and money collected from vines will go to accident victims vasculitis speed isn't always the cause of an accident but it systematically makes it worse or even fatal our aim is to reduce the number and gravity of accidents the measure will be reviewed after two years if driving more slowly puts the brakes on the number of people dying on the road the 80 kilometer limit remain in place Natacha butler al jazeera patooie france
