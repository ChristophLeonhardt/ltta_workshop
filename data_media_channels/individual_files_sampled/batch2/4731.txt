the president says he is once again cruising toward a summit on June 12th with Kim jong-un whatever happens the president has for now set a new high-water mark in repairing relations with the Hermit Kingdom when kim yeongcheol visited the White House on Friday but the brittle nature of the negotiations has created an emotional rollercoaster of will they or won't they perhaps summed up by best by this dramatic reenactment game on game on I winged and she's okay game on yeah came on so the game is on for now okay let's go into the car crush let's hope and it seems as though she's okay so hopefully you know everyone will Elise come in life but where do things stand here I mean what and and how nervously our our American allies watching this kind of back and forth between Trump and kim jeong-hoon suddenly if you're in South Korea are watching it nervously because the prospect that it could be back off for again and tensions could ratchet up again worries them a lot already what we're seeing is that the North Koreans have got quite a lot out of this they're getting the photo opportunity they've got divisions within the alliance of South Korea China and America when it comes to maximum pressure that's ease tensions in North Korea substantially and they're starting to see an uptick in aid and sanctions busting financial flows into the country as well so it's hard to see that the president hasn't given away a lot in terms of the summit without getting very much upfront in return and that's exactly what Bill Clinton was you know the reason Bill Clinton didn't have a summit with the North Koreans back at the end of the 1990s was because he wanted the denuclearization to come first Trump has flipped that right almost see whether he actually gets the end goal afterwards well then even the picture of Trump smiling with Kim Hyung controllers in some ways yeah wait and wait until it's kim jeong-hoon right Bob Kosta you read anything into Bolton not attending the plan summit I mean there's been some behind-the-scenes friction there I love the Wayne's World reference my favorite scene was Bohemian Rhapsody when they're all singing it in the car but when you think about the National Security Advisor he's not in the meeting the vice president's not in the meeting based on some conversations I had with White House officials this weekend they say that those officials were playing the bad cop role in the negotiations taking a harder line as Secretary of State Pompeo and the president took a different tack in the negotiations and there all this is all part of the White House's attempt to have a historic moment that may not lead June 12th the denuclearization or any kind of firm commitment but if it ends the Korean War if it establishes diplomatic ties they're trying to begin the sale now to say to the American people and US allies that that's enough that's the start of a process so you Michel sander you cover the White House every day I mean do they see this as are they at the point where they feel like this will be America can can come out of the out of this having won something significant if even if they don't get to total denuclearization I think that the the President himself feels I don't know if America would have won something but I think the president feels as though if he can sit down he can at least start saying I'm gone more about him and the country writ large I mean I think that the people that I've talked to say that the president very much thinks that it's good it's in the country's best interest to sit down with with Kim jong-un I think that the president also wants to be seen as a president who did more than other presidents and as a result when you have these pictures some people might say okay well the North Korea is getting getting to be able to have this image with an American president where President Trump is also gonna be able to be taking a victory lown a victory lap saying look at all the things that I did and by the way that letter that he said hey I'm gonna lay out I'm gonna cancel this he's basically telling North Korea I don't really need this I and I think that the perception by from a lot of people after reading that letter was that President Trump was ready to just give this all up because he didn't it wasn't that important to him so now that it's back on he can make the argument that says well I didn't really need this they came crawling to me and now I look at all the things that I've gotten done so I think that it's it's very clear that they don't have a clear plan for what the Okuma nuclearization will mean to North Korea long term like they don't know they're sitting down I think wind's actually quite a lot of Approval around the world most people like the idea that we're talking rather than promising fire and fury the question is have if you're really going to lift the maximum pressure that has taken an awful lot of time and effort and coordination to get us into a position where there's maximum pressure then are you giving away too much in order to sit down hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube
