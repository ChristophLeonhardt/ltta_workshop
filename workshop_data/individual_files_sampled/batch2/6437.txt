to understand American healthcare one need to look no further than the most recent exclusive reporter on the news at dan Rather to understand how we even define healthcare American healthcare is not defined based on any level of engagement activity observation treatment education any activity or action or even thought that relates to improving the health of a human being instead healthcare in America is based on the ability for private companies to extract as much money as possible from individuals while paying out as little as possible by either not providing any health coverage or sickness treatment really cuz it's not really health coverage with sickness treatment to anybody or when they do have to provide sickness treatment to anybody to shift that cost away from the private company on to the government or some other third-party provider so the vast majority of the resources that our so-called health care companies and I emphasize so-called is spent employing individuals whose primary task is to figure how not to pay to provide any benefit to someone who is sick or to try to find a government entity or third party that can absorb that cost while collecting as much money as possible from individuals and institutions in the name of health care the rest of the world views the American view of health care as basically a predatory system designed to destroy human beings for the enrichment of a few individuals when you look at this most recent report that view of the American health care system probably is too favorable to say that America should be ashamed is surely too small of an indictment and I offer my compliments to the reporters and of course to mr. Wrather for bringing this particular example of how egregious the abusive nature of our health care system is to light such that people can actually come to understand it even if ultimately our political system due to gerrymandering closed primaries closed debate stages etc doesn't really allow a political solution at least we do have the awareness to understand what the system is so that at the very least we can focus on maintaining our own health lest we become product for this system
