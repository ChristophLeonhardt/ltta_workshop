00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,354
COHN AND WEISELBERG. >> THE REASON THEY TURN IS

167
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:52,555
>> THE REASON THEY TURN IS BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY’RE

168
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:53,556
BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY’RE VULNERABLE TO PROSECUTION.

169
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:55,024
VULNERABLE TO PROSECUTION. THEY KNOW OR SENSE THEY DID

170
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:56,759
THEY KNOW OR SENSE THEY DID SOMETHING WRONG THAT CAN BE USED

171
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,861
SOMETHING WRONG THAT CAN BE USED TO PUT THEM IN JAIL FOR A LONG

172
00:05:58,863 --> 00:05:59,162

REAL LAWYER. INDIVIDUAL 1 IS THE WAY TRUMP

INDIVIDUAL 1 IS THE WAY TRUMP WAS REFERRED TO IN MICHAEL

190
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:40,871
WAS REFERRED TO IN MICHAEL COHEN’S PLEA DEAL.

191
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:41,905
COHEN’S PLEA DEAL. HE’S PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,407
HE’S PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HE PROBABLY CAN’T BE

194
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,977
INDICTED WHILE HE’S PRESIDENT. THAT’S HIS ONE ACE IN THE HOLE.

195
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:49,913
THAT’S HIS ONE ACE IN THE HOLE. BUT HE CAN BE INDICTED DOWN THE

QUESTION OF FACT. THERE SEEMS TO BE ONE HOLDOUT

YOUR THOUGHTS? >> I’M NOT SO SURE THAT HE CAN’T

211
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:18,809
BE INDICTED, I MEAN IF HE WENT AROUND ASSASSINATING POLITICAL

212
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:20,744
AROUND ASSASSINATING POLITICAL RIVALS AND CONGRESS WOULD BE IN

213
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:22,746
RIVALS AND CONGRESS WOULD BE IN FEAR OF THEIR OWN LIVES BEFORE

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:29,186
FEAR OF THEIR OWN LIVES BEFORE THEY CAN STAND IMPEACHMENT

215

THEY CAN STAND IMPEACHMENT PROCESS.

216
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:30,220
PROCESS. >> DO YOU THINK KAVANAGH WOULD

218
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:35,058
SAY THAT? >> WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT

219
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,459
>> WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT ANOTHER TIME.

220
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:37,761
ANOTHER TIME. BUT THE KOONGSCONSTITUTION’S FLE

221
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:39,529
BUT THE KOONGSCONSTITUTION’S FLE ON THIS POINT.

222
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:42,166
ON THIS POINT. OPTION TWO IS IMPEACHMENT.

223
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,869
OPTION TWO IS IMPEACHMENT. DEMOCRATS ARE WORRIED ABOUT

224
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,404
DEMOCRATS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MIDTERMS IN NOVEMBER.

225
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:47,872
MIDTERMS IN NOVEMBER. AND OPTION THREE, THAT’S THE

226
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:50,108
AND OPTION THREE, THAT’S THE MOST REALISTIC OPTION HERE, IT’S

227
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:51,675
MOST REALISTIC OPTION HERE, IT’S NOT JUST TRUMP HIMSELF, WE HAVE

228
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,210
NOT JUST TRUMP HIMSELF, WE HAVE GOT THE ORGANIZATION, WHICH HE

229
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:54,178
GOT THE ORGANIZATION, WHICH HE CARES A LOT ABOUT.

230
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:56,480
CARES A LOT ABOUT. HE CAN’T HIDE BEHIND EXECUTIVE

231
00:07:56,481 --> 00:08:01,518
HE CAN’T HIDE BEHIND EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE FOR THAT, HE CAN’T

232
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:02,253
PRIVILEGE FOR THAT, HE CAN’T ARGUE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

233
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:05,389
ARGUE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE DIDN’T APPLY TO ME, THAT’S

234
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:05,823
DIDN’T APPLY TO ME, THAT’S OUTSIDE OF IT.

235
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:07,057
OUTSIDE OF IT. AND OF COURSE HE ALSO HAS HIS

236
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:07,391
AND OF COURSE HE ALSO HAS HIS CHILDREN.

237
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:09,159
CHILDREN. AND THESE PROSECUTORS ARE BEING

238
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:11,495
AND THESE PROSECUTORS ARE BEING SMART KIND OF MOVING IN,

239
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,963
SMART KIND OF MOVING IN, OUTFLANKING HIM IN SOME PLACES

240
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:14,665
OUTFLANKING HIM IN SOME PLACES AND AT SOME POINT HE’S GOING TO

241
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,467
AND AT SOME POINT HE’S GOING TO BE LEFT STANDING ALONE, AND THE

242
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:19,003
BE LEFT STANDING ALONE, AND THE IDEA BEHIND NOT INDICTING A

243
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:21,105
IDEA BEHIND NOT INDICTING A PRESIDENT, IS THAT UNDER ARTICLE

244
00:08:21,106 --> 00:08:23,507
PRESIDENT, IS THAT UNDER ARTICLE 2 THE EXECUTIVE POWER WOULD BE

245
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,209
2 THE EXECUTIVE POWER WOULD BE INTERFERED WITH BY AN ONGOING

246
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:25,810
INTERFERED WITH BY AN ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

247
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:28,212
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. I THINK THIS INSANITY WE’RE

248
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:30,081
I THINK THIS INSANITY WE’RE LIVING THROUGH IS THE ABILITY

249
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:32,417
LIVING THROUGH IS THE ABILITY FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO

250
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:32,784
FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO FUNCTION.

251
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:34,886
FUNCTION. WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES, HOW IS

252
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:35,819
WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES, HOW IS THE GOVERNMENT EVEN FUNCTIONING

253
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:37,555
THE GOVERNMENT EVEN FUNCTIONING AT THIS POINT?

254
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:39,223
AT THIS POINT? >> HERE’S A GUY WHO GOT EVERY

255
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:40,423
>> HERE’S A GUY WHO GOT EVERY BREAK IN THE CAMPAIGN, I MEAN

256
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:43,161
BREAK IN THE CAMPAIGN, I MEAN ALL THE STATES WE WATCHED

257
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:45,229
ALL THE STATES WE WATCHED ELECTION NIGHT IN ’16 WENT HIS

258
00:08:45,264 --> 00:08:48,933
ELECTION NIGHT IN ’16 WENT HIS WAY, HE DIDN’T GET MINNESOTA OR

259
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:49,500
WAY, HE DIDN’T GET MINNESOTA OR NORTH CAROLINA.

260
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:50,735
NORTH CAROLINA. HE GOT EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN

261
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:51,135
HE GOT EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN PLAY.

262
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:52,937
PLAY. AND THEY ALL BROKE LOST IN THE

263
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:54,038
AND THEY ALL BROKE LOST IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO.

264
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,007
LAST WEEK OR SO. HE’S BEEN THE BENEFICIARY OF

265
00:08:56,008 --> 00:08:58,910
HE’S BEEN THE BENEFICIARY OF GOOD LUCK IN HIS LIFE I WOULD

266
00:08:58,911 --> 00:08:59,143
GOOD LUCK IN HIS LIFE I WOULD SAY.

267
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:01,312
SAY. IT DOES SEEM THAT IT’S EVENING

268
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:03,314
IT DOES SEEM THAT IT’S EVENING OUT, THE BAD LUCK IS CATCHING UP

269
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:04,248
OUT, THE BAD LUCK IS CATCHING UP WITH THE GOOD LUCK.

270
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:05,950
WITH THE GOOD LUCK. WHAT A WEEK FOR THIS GUY.

271
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:07,518
WHAT A WEEK FOR THIS GUY. >> THAT’S THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF

272
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:09,521
>> THAT’S THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE CENTURY THAT TRUMP HAS

273
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:10,455
THE CENTURY THAT TRUMP HAS BENEFITTED FROM GOOD LUCK.

274
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:12,257
BENEFITTED FROM GOOD LUCK. AND YOU’RE RIGHT, I THINK IT’S

275
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:12,624
AND YOU’RE RIGHT, I THINK IT’S TURNING.

276
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:14,159
TURNING. ON A POLITICAL LEVEL, WHEN YOU

277
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:15,560
ON A POLITICAL LEVEL, WHEN YOU ZOOM OUT FROM THIS A LITTLE BIT.

278
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:16,728
ZOOM OUT FROM THIS A LITTLE BIT. THIS IS SO DANGEROUS FOR DONALD

279
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:17,729
THIS IS SO DANGEROUS FOR DONALD TRUMP.

280
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,264
TRUMP. HE’S NOW GOT MICHAEL COHEN,

281
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:20,632
HE’S NOW GOT MICHAEL COHEN, WHO’S PLEADED GUILTY TO THESE

282
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,667
WHO’S PLEADED GUILTY TO THESE CRIMES AND SAID THE PRESIDENT

283
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:24,068
CRIMES AND SAID THE PRESIDENT DIRECTLY WOULD DO THAT.

284
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,071
DIRECTLY WOULD DO THAT. THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT SCANDAL

285
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:27,272
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT SCANDAL TODAY BECAUSE -- THAN IT WAS

286
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:29,741
TODAY BECAUSE -- THAN IT WAS JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, BECAUSE

287
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:31,776
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, BECAUSE WHAT WAS ABSTRACT AND STATIC IS

288
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:33,345
WHAT WAS ABSTRACT AND STATIC IS NOW VERY MUCH REAL.

289
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,280
NOW VERY MUCH REAL. AND VERY MUCH CLOSING IN ON HIM.

290
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:36,748
AND VERY MUCH CLOSING IN ON HIM. AND THE PROBLEM POLITICALLY IS

291
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:38,283
AND THE PROBLEM POLITICALLY IS IT’S GOING TO HANG OUT THERE FOR

292
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:38,950
IT’S GOING TO HANG OUT THERE FOR A WHILE.

293
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:40,485
A WHILE. WE’RE GOING TO SEE MORE

WE’RE GOING TO SEE MORE DEVELOPMENTS OUT OF MICHAEL
