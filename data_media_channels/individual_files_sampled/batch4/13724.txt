last week President Obama became the target of mockery when he descended into Porky Pig prata stations at the divisive nough some Republican nominee Donald Trump after tripping over his words while trying to gain his footing Obama finally settled on a line of attack here's what he said he said quote if we turn against each other based on divisions breaks or religion if we fall for a bunch of okey doke just because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative then we're not gonna build on the progress we started meanwhile across the country likely Obama supporters rioted at a trump event in San Jose they waved Mexican flags and burned American ones they saw two Trump supporters and they generally engaged in mayhem now the same day Donald Trump labeled a judge presiding over his civil trial unfit for his job he said I'm building a wall it's an inherent conflict of interest what pray tell was the inherent conflict of interest Trump said that the judge is one of them Mexicans judge by the way I was born in Indiana to Mexican parents two days later Trump told Fox News's Jeanine Pirro Barack Obama has been a terrible president but he's been a tremendous divider he has divided this country from rich and poor black and white his divided this country like no president in my opinion almost ever I will bring people together so who's right they're both right Obama like it or not leads a coalition of tribes Trump like it or not leads another coalition of tribes the founding fathers weep in their graves the founders were scholars of both Thomas Hobbes and John Locke Thomas Hobbes argued that the state of nature primitive society revolves around a war of quote every man against every man in such a state life was awful he wrote no arts no letters no society and which is worst of all continual fear and danger of violent death the life of man solitary poor nasty brutish and short he learned all this in high school the solution to such chaos said Thomas Hobbes was the Leviathan the state he said it was quote but an artificial man though of Greater stature and strength than the natural for whose protection and defense it was intended and in which the sovereignty is an artificial soul as giving life and motion to the whole body so basically the state comes along and fixes the problem of tribes fighting each other because it's so big and so powerful Hobbesian theory has prevailed throughout human history tribal societies either remain in a constant state of war with each other or they're overthrown by a powerful government Jared Diamond who's an anthropologist he writes that quote tribal warfare tends to be chronic because there are not strong central governments can enforce peace those strong central governments often arise says anthropologist Francis Fukuyama thanks to the advent of religion which unites tribes across family boundaries right my family may not be your family but if we both believe in Jesus or if we both believe in the Bible then at the very least we have some commonality the rise of powerful leadership leads to both tyranny and peace the founders were scholars of Thomas Hobbes there were also scholars of John Locke but in Western societies tyranny cannot last after generations of tyranny after tribalism gives way to judeo-christian teachings enforced the new government religious tyranny citizens begin to question why we even need a tyrant in the first place they begin to ask John Locke's question in a state of nature we had rights from one another why is the tyrant allowed to invade those rights it's prevention of violence a rationale for full government control our governments created to protect our rights our founders came down on the side of Locke not Hobbes they said in the Declaration of Independence that quote to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed but the founders still they still fear tribalism and that's what they call faction whenever you hear them talk about faction and the Federalist Papers they're truly worried about the seizure of government in order to benefit one tribe over another they may have agreed with Locke / Hobbes about the proper extents of government but they never believed the tribalism had disappeared that's why they attempted to create a government that Pitt faction against faction tribe against tribe cutting the Gordian knot of tyranny and tribalism with checks and balances is what James Madison wrote in Federalist 51 year old quote if men were angels no government would be necessary if angels were to govern men neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary in framing a government which is to be administered by men over men the great difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government to control the government and govern this is the tyranny and the next place oblige it to control itself is the Lockean rights argument a dependence on the people is no doubt the primary controlling government but experience has taught mankind the necess it and the necessity of auxiliary precautions this is what Madison said there's a brilliant solution to a real problem so long as it worked sadly no longer does tribalism has had its revenge it began with the decline of American religion in the 1950s as religion declined Americans looked for new sources of community new community ties and the nineteen these the Marxist left provided Americans that meaning with ethnic and racial solidarity it wasn't that we were all Christian or all Jewish or all judeo-christian instead we were black and white we were Mexican we were Jewish even as America began to move beyond its historic racism the left hijack the conversation around race and divvied up Americans into subgroups of ethnic haves and have-nots city governments became playgrounds for racial factions racial tribes taking control of government and expanding their power student groups divided along racial and sexual lines the social fabric frayed the unrest of the 60s and 70s that provoked a law-and-order backlash a desire for a powerful government that would stop all the tribalism but for three decades Americans rejected tribalism is a mode of politics Ronald Reagan for example he wanted a stronger crackdown on tribalism he believed in universal human freedoms and Bill Clinton Wirth rejected sister soldiers race-baiting if you recall not surprisingly the rejection of 1960s tribalism assured in an era of smaller government dedicated to the proposition that constitutional checks and balances were the best protection against tyranny then came Obama President Obama's tribal policies have crippled us crippled us Americans hoped that obama after campaigning on the notion he would provide a capstone to our non tribalism would heal our wounds move our country beyond racial politics he was to be a racial unifier he represented the hope that America could finally reject tribalism in favor of American universalism instead Obama rejected checks and balances and has used tribalism to grow his tyranny by cobbling together a coalition of racial and ethnic interest groups Obama knew he could maximize the power of the government to act on their behalf so his DOJ his Department of Justice crippled police departments based solely on the race of police officers he suggests America has an inborn unfixable problem with racism he says that is a rejection of the founding ideology Donald Trump is the council reaction but he's not like Reagan or even Bill Clinton he is also tribal his tribalism is the tribalism of PAP you cannon here's what Buchanan wrote in 2011 quote to increase the GOP share of the white Christian vote and increase the turnout of that vote by specific appeals to social cultural and moral issues and for equal justice for the emerging white minority so fight for the white minority he says why should Americans be ashamed represent the progeny of the men who founded builds and defended America since her birth as a nation he concluded white anger is a legitimate response to racial injustice has done to white people instead of attempting to set checks and balances to prevent faction instead of trying to educate Americans and founding principles this philosophy focus on tribalism of white folks making the crucial error of linking skin-colored culture so we've reached the end of the era of small government as tribalism rises and as chaos ensues Americans look again to the strongmen we begin the cycle anew first we feel the rage of riots in San Jose in Ferguson and the spiteful Glee of white nationalists all writers we watch contests between tribal figures like Hillary and Trump we wonder which tribe will win even as America disintegrates right in front of us I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so yay last night was a historic moment yes everybody excited Hillary Clinton is the first felon to be nominated for President of the United States no no everybody is very excited because Hillary Clinton has vagina and this of course is the most important thing in the world except for all of the other things in the world but this is the most important thing that has ever happened in the history of man the media could not be more excited or at least they feign an excitement they're not really excited and media is not really excited I'll give you why they're not really excited in a second but they have to pretend they're excited so here's a quick montage cut by our own my office of all of the members of the media who are just ecstatic over the moon that a woman who allegedly has a vagina is talking about about how she is broken the glass ceiling and finally women can be anything finally women can do anything women girls everywhere you should know that if you if you grow up rich go to the best schools marry a guy who him as president intimidate his rape victims and then run on the basis of his success for her president you too can be President of the United States girls very exciting stuff so here's the media just over the moon about all of this tonight Hillary Clinton making history a turning point in American politics and a moment of reflection from Clinton herself this is an historic moment eight years in the making Secretary Clinton becoming the first woman ever to clinch her party's nomination I'm in the history of this country I frankly it's really exciting to say but the first time in history this country we're gonna have a female nominee of a major party I don't care if you're Republican or Democrat libertarian that's something this country should note and acknowledge Hilary Clinton making her mark on history according to the news we are on the brink of a historic historic unprecedented moment we begin with that history in the making Hillary Clinton clinching the Democratic nomination for president the first woman to be nominees is a major partner there they're all gonna play this up they're all gonna play like they give a crap okay so there's a few reasons why this is completely valueless and stupid and the media is just ho-ho finally the first female mom and it first of all okay let's just point this out Margaret Thatcher was the Prime Minister of Britain 40 years ago okay Golda Meir was the Prime Minister of Israel 50 years ago hey this idea that females have it rough in Western civilization this is so stupid that I have a young girl okay my young girl could have run for president whether or not Hillary Clinton ran for president fact there's a worse shot she'll be President because Hillary's gonna give all women a bad name by being Hillary Clinton hey they're here five reasons why this doesn't matter at all and why no one is excited about it they're all pretending they're excited nobody's really excited they all know this is boring and it's stupid so number one in order for something to be historic you actually have to have overcome obstacles or you actually have to have overcome obstacles so I didn't think it was that historic when Obama became the first black president cuz I didn't think there were that many Americans who sat around a night going we have to stop the blacks from becoming president I think it's a small group of people Sonne became president I was like okay I knew he I knew a black I could be president I just think he's a really bad guy to be President and he happens to be black okay whatever and this is why I didn't fall into the Laura Ingraham trap of oh it's a historic moment for America know as a crappy moment cause Obama's a crappy president nobody opposed Hillary because she's a woman and there's no obstacle for her to overcome everybody knew she was gonna be President since she was in the womb right before she was in the womb right she's been running for president since she was born so this idea that she is some sort of standard bearer for women is crap second of all women complaining that we finally have someone to represent us 53% of all presidential votes in 2008 and 2012 were women women are the majority of voters you don't get to complain about your being victimized in the electoral process when you're the majority of the people voting that's silly talk the electoral process isn't victimizing you if you're the majority so say your real victims yeah real victims again fine also it's a lot more historic at Hillary's under FBI investigation than that she's a woman let's be real about this if this were Sarah Palin who'd want a presidential nomination which given the way this is gone it may yet happen the the you know the you can guarantee the media wouldn't be going nuts over it in the same way the media didn't give a damn that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio were winning primaries in both of them were Hispanic they don't care okay fourth reason Obama stole Hillary's thunder like eight years ago people were really pumped about this eight years ago they were saying oh well you know it's either gonna be the first woman or the first black guy and blacks outrank women on the the leftist hierarchy of victimhood so Obama came along and he stole all her thunder and now nobody cares I mean this is like the it's transformers to nobody like the first movie all that much and the second movie no one needed little earn lots of money and may be successful at the box office but it's gonna be a complete crap show and nobody wants to see it finally women generally are not victims of society the notion that Hillary Clinton has been victimized in any way because she's a woman is absolutely absurd it's absolutely absurd she's only become successful because she's woman if she were a man no one would give her a second look as a politician she's terrible on stage she's awful interpersonally she has no new ideas she's really boring she's deeply corrupt she's the worst presidential candidate in modern history I mean she's really that bad so this idea that she's been a victim and now she's overcome it is just crap nonetheless Hillary Clinton is is out there and she's talking about wonderful all of this is so Hillary spoke last night and the media I mean I have to say the media there're a lot of people buying into the idea that Trump was gonna be president after he after he destroyed the media during his primary run I never fully bought into it specifically because I said but the media the media was bound to open up their guns on Trump when we hit a general that's what's happened so far so the media criticized Hillary oh she's not fun oh she's not interesting maybe Berg Sanders is more interesting now that they're in general election mode they're now making Hillary into the great heroine she's that she's the kindly hearted grandmother who's just here to help us and so Hillary Clinton she spoke last night about how her vagina qualified her for high office here she is talking about how she's broken the glass ceiling with her cankles clip one it is wonderful to be back in Brooklyn here in this beautiful building and it may be hard to see tonight but we are all standing under a glass ceiling right now we're not smashing this one thanks to you we've reached a milestone first the first time in our nation's history that a woman will be a major parties okay there's only one problem she's saying this in Brooklyn New York okay if she said she was a man in this speech and I called her a woman they would find me in Brooklyn New York Celeste has this bizarre notion that men can be women and women can be men except when it comes to Hillary it's super important that she's a woman deeply important that Hillary Clinton is an actual female because females are different than men but if you say females are different than men then you're a sexist and you're against transgenders and you have to be fined $250,000 by the people in New York so very exciting the left has no idea what it's talking about all they know is that it's a milestone a milestone moment for Hillary Clinton and then Hillary continued along these lines Hillary Clinton she suggests that she this is where she makes her political case and this is the thing she's the same old boring politician she's the same old boring Democrat politician with a boo-hoo-hoo that's that's her entire appeal her entire appeal is and when Trump says that all she has to play is the woman's card this is correct this is right okay it's it's true she's all she has is this that's it so here here is Hillary Clinton making her political case and you'll see just how weak this is as we look ahead to the battle that awaits let's remember all that unites us we all want an economy with more opportunity and less inequality where Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again we all want a government that listens to the people not the power brokers which means getting unaccountable money out of politics and we all want Asus that is tolerant inclusive and fair okay this is so unbelievable that these things are leaving her mouth right okay what did she just say here's what she said right there she says a couple of things an economy with less inequality she's worth a hundred million dollars because she's charging people six figures to speak right she was in Chappaqua because she's a politician who made money off her politics she says Wall Street shouldn't be able to recommend Street again Hillary Clinton was literally the person who laid the ground stone for Goldman Sachs in New York City we have the pictures and then she says we want a government that listens to the people not the power brokers what you ran the Clinton Foundation where you sold government favors on behalf of dictatorships and then she said she wants to get unaccountable money out of politics really really that's what you want to do and then she says she wants aasaiya T that's tolerance inclusive and fair except for her Republican enemies and religious people who have to be shut up at the first available opportunity so all this is crap oh this is crap but she's wearing a really expensive coat and she has a vagina so that's that's all that matters she just take that old old wine and pour it into a new bottle but it's it's a it's a new magically Genet and genitally different bottle so that's that's all that matters here by the way I'm not sure where she gets her clothing this one I think she got from Christian Bale in equilibrium but she continues along then Hillary turns to her main opponent and politics the art of opposition and so here's where Hillary is gonna be strong as this is where Hillary goes after Donald Trump but even here Hillary's wildly incompetent makes me so sad about this folks Hillary does not deserve to be a major party nominee she doesn't deserve to be in politics she's a criminal she deserves to be in prison it shouldn't be hard to beat her in a general election in a minute we're gonna get to the other side of the aisle and you'll see why it's not going to be easy for Donald Trump to beat her in a general election here's Hillary taking on Trump when he says let's make America great again that is code for let's take America backwards back to a time when opportunity and dignity were reserved for some not all promising his supporters an economy he cannot recreate we however we want to write the next chapter in American greatness with a 21st century prosperity that lifts everyone who's been left out and left behind including those who may not vote for us but who deserve their chance to make a new beginning illegal immigrants their that's that's the reference Hillary Clinton is legitimately she stole Barack Obama stump speech and now she's using it okay that line make America great again is taking us backwards well as Trump scam what was Obama's campaign slogan in 2012 again oh yeah that's right it was forward right he argued that MIT Romney want to take us back to the fifty so she's running all the same playbook this is why she's easy to beat gang she's running exactly the same playbook it's the only playbook she knows she's a by-the-book wrote corrupt Democrat hack she always has been but she's a woman and so we're gonna pretend that we're excited about this and then she attacks Trump and here is where she actually has some material against Trump here she goes after Trump for his racism when Donald Trump says a distinguished judge born in Indiana can't do his job because of his Mexican heritage or he mocks a reporter with disabilities or calls women pigs it goes against everything we stand it will stop it there so acaso Hilary so Hilary going after Trump there's no defense for Trump here he could go after her and say she does a lot of these same things but she doesn't mock people with disabilities she's terrible to women but again what would be nice is if we didn't have a candidate who was this vulnerable on all of these charges and this is what Hillary's gonna do right so this is what Hillary's gonna do she's gonna knock Trump on all of this and she's gonna campaign as kind of the typical Democrat and then she's gonna swivel and she's gonna do what every successful Democratic presidential candidate has done for the last thirty years she's going to run as a moderate Republican seriously watch this Hillary Clinton is already swiveling to the general and she's already starting to run as a moderate Republican so here's Hillary Clinton campaigning is a moderate Republican well we believe we should lift each other up not tear each other unless my husband raped in that case I'll tell you damn sure we believe we believe we need to give Americans a raise not complain that hard-working people's wages are too high we believe we need to help young people struggling with student debt not pile more on national debt with giveaways to the super wealthy we believe we need to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century although - Ozzy insists that climate change is a hoax he's like you go Hillary so here's the so what she does is she takes a lot of these leftist tropes and she mixes them up with things that are not leftist so for example she says we can't pile more on our national debt with giveaways to the super wealthy since one of Democrats cared about the national debt they blew it out blew it out right her husband cut the national debt but she hasn't right when she says that she wants to make America the grid the clean energy superpower for ignorant people you can't make America a clean energy superpower without destroying all of the jobs that actually create the energy upon which you live but she says all these things and she sounds like a moderate she sounds like a moderate and then listen this one's amazing here's where she goes for moderate right listen to her take a couple of leftist like a drop of leftism and mix it in with a bunch of right-wing rhetoric here we go to be great we can't be small we have to be as big as the values that define America and we are a big-hearted fair-minded country we teach our children that this is one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice she's nodding to herself she's nods to herself all the way through this horriffic speech okay so notice something the Democrats want to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance this has been a major issue okay I was at the 2012 DNC at Democratic National Convention when they literally booed God because God was in their platform and they wanted to remove it and here she is preaching Republican stuff about God and liberty and justice indivisible etc and none of its real none of its real but her shtick here is gonna be I'm gonna campaign as a moderate I'm the moderate with of a hoo-hoo and so she concludes by saying that she's going to finish by breaking the glass ceiling here is Hillary finishing her campaign based on her chromosomal composition there are still ceilings to break for women and men for all of us but don't let anyone tell you that great things can't happen in America barriers can come down justice and equality can win our history has moved in that direction slowly at times but unmistakably okay to the generations ripping off she's just ripping off Obama's rhetoric and this is what Obama did all the way through 2008 he said barriers can come down I'm proof that barriers can come down then he got into office and he said only that all the barriers are still here and they're terrible these barriers they're awful that's why you have to reelect me is to take those barriers down and now Hillary is saying oh look at that the barriers are down because you're electing me and then as soon as she gets into office it'll be the barriers are still up guess we need a bigger government see for the left the barriers never come down so there's all rooms okay all this is lies all this is typical Democratic nonsense all this is garbage but the media have to be excited because if they can slap a new face on it then it's just magical I mean all this is is just you know they're these series like Law & Order where they do law and order CSI or CSU or whatever they just have Special Victims Unit and then they have Law & Order Hawaiian narcs and they you know that like they have law and order and thousand spin-offs and eventually you just go okay I got this this is the same show with the same formula you just put a couple of new leads in there yeah that's Hillary Hillary's the new lead we have to find an excuse to be excited about her cuz we can't be excited about her we have to find an excuse to be excited about her ideas but we can't be excited about her ideas so instead we go to well you know she's elated she the first one doing it she's the first one okay so me and while on the other side of the aisle Donald Trump is desperately trying to tamp down the civil war that he has initiated with his own stupidity and so Donald Trump and yes racism Donald Trump is now reading from a teleprompter so all of these Republicans are so desperate desperate to get behind him they're desperate to get behind him they are looking for any excuse to back him so Trump tries to give them one last night he wins the primaries because there's nobody else running at this point and then he flanks himself with with his wife who looks like his daughter and he proceeds to explain via teleprompter what he wants for America and they have to put teleprompter because if he's off teleprompter he's gonna call somebody the n-word or something you never know I mean he could he's just gonna spill something mouth it's gonna be bad so here here's Donald Trump going after talking about how he is going to be unifying people he's these he starts off with his with his victory speech he says we're closing a chapter in history says Hillary's historic I'm historic too now recent polls have shown that I'm beating Hillary Clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that you've made and she has made tremendous mistakes we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially to everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign I want to thank you I want to thank you very very much to those who voted for someone else in either party I will work hard to earn your support and I will work very hard to earn that support to all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super-delegates we welcome you with open arms and by the way the terrible trade deals that burning was so vehemently against and he's right on that will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible and that's what I do we are going to have fantastic trade deals we're gonna start making money and bringing in jobs okay so Easy's making promises he can't possibly keep and then he's trying to draw in the Sanders supporters but he's a great unifier quick note when he says we won so many votes more votes than anybody in history it's historic it is historic he's the first orange man to ever be a presidential nominee for a major party but besides that he and and and the first thrice-married guy and the first reality TV star so history is being made as we watch folks it's also exciting between Hillary and Trump it's under which is more historic the Hindenburg er that iconic but it's all very historic quick note when Trump says he won more votes than any Republican primary candidate in history it is worth noting that Donald Trump also lost more primary votes than any candidate in history he won about thirteen point two million votes he lost about sixteen million votes right so he won a lower percentage of the vote then and as the nominee than any candidate since Richard Nixon in 1968 so yeah then he continues and he says he's gonna create peace he says he's he's a fighter but he wants to make peace now I know some people say I'm too much of a fighter my preference is always peace however and I've shown that I've shown that for a long time an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved always my goal is always again to bring people together but if I'm forced to fight for something I really care about I will never ever back down and our country will never ever back down all right so he sees his dick he's gonna make peace and in fact on the teleprompter and everybody's very excited everybody's just okay very excited he's back on the teleprompter clearly Donald Trump we fight we've been waiting for good Trump right we keep waiting for good Trump and we're finally we finally hit good Trump right we've been waiting for the Trump who can control himself and be presidential and who can take it to Hillary Clinton and go right at Hillary Clinton and he does this he says that he's gonna go right at Hillary Clinton he says he's gonna give speed big speech on Monday in which he goes after Hillary Clinton and he talks about the State Department being her hedge fund and all this stuff fine within 24 hours here is Donald Trump on Twitter within 24 hours so here's Donald Trump on Twitter quote nobody is watching Morning Joe anymore gone off the deep end bad ratings you won't believe what I am watching now this is good Trump okay retweeting where is the reporting most votes for president in history of the USA all capital letters right he's retweeting people now and praise himself great speech SPE a CH great speech Thanks and as everybody's retweeting top RINO hack for MSNBC Joey Scarborough on the air and calling the next president Trump a racist and a bigot shame on you so this is good Trump this is what good Trump looks like good Trump looks like this idiot by the way when he says I'm not watching MSNBC you'll never guess what I am watching you're right I don't know what is it is it pornography are you watching bikini videos of your daughter are you watching the world burn I mean it could be anything it could be anything I don't know he's such a mystery such a mystery this is good Trump and good Trump also says Republicans are just gonna have to get over the fact that he says stupid things every so often here is Donald Trump last night after saying he's a great unifier he glares into the camera and and explains that everybody needs to hop on board the Trump train here in the last 24 hours and I'm thinking I haven't heard these some of these Republicans attack Barack Obama who was able to pass his entire agenda because they wouldn't fight him as hard as they're fighting you does that is that a feeling you have said I don't care where the judge comes from or where judges come from I just want to see I want to get a fair shake and we've had some very unfair opinions coming and you wonder what's going on and I will tell you it's a little disappointing some of the Republicans and in all fairness they're some of the people that I went through war with and and I won and there's a lot of there's a lot of anxiety there there's a lot of you know there's a lot of anger I guess anger they just can't come back they can't get over it so they have to get over it ideally as to whether or not they endorse me it's okay if they don't but they have to get over did you get her everybody get over okay first of all Sean Hannity my god okay why haven't any of these people attacked Obama as harshly as they've attacked Trump I was here okay I was here I spent last eight years ripping Obama a new one okay most of the never Trump people I'm not talking about some of the Fairweather never Trump Russ I'm not talking about the john Kasich's of the world right talking about the hardcore conservative never Trump pers the people at National Review for example talk about Erick Erickson you think these were people who are soft on Obama alright the question is why you're backing a guy who mirrors half of Obama's policies and and mirrors half of his philosophy but in any case the did Trump that's good Trump so waiting for good Trump is like waiting for godot ok kudos never showing up and neither is a good Trump it's never gonna happen I mean what but I will note this and this is worth noting this is worth noting ok the difference between Republicans and Democrats is that when Republicans nominate somebody absolutely unfit like Donald Trump there's a civil war inside the Republican Party when Democrats nominate somebody absolutely unfit like Hillary Clinton they consolidated around her the banner goes up and they say that she's the greatest thing since sliced bread and that's what's been happening so for example here is here is Claire McCaskill who is a Hillary ally she's asked directly about Hillary brokering deals for the Russians and there's a famous story in which Hillary Clinton at the State Department allowed the Russians to buy this uranium company in the United States then the Russian government was giving money or or the the firm was giving money to the Clinton Foundation of time watch Claire McCaskill cut and run on this one and another point of attack for him is going to be the Clinton Global Initiative whether it's why the tax returns were restated what that means what deals Bill Clinton was making with Russia and uranium what kind of shady nations were able to give a lot of money to that foundation while Clinton was a Secretary of State these are real concerns do you think that you have real answers well I think that the Clinton Foundation did a lot of good around the world and Hillary Clinton could have easily said no I don't want to be Secretary of State I want to go make more money at any juncture Clinton could have made a choice in life to make money she made a choice at every juncture in her life to serve the public every school in public service and I think that's important leave Sally right there she made a choice at every point her life to serve the public to serve a public in Hillary Clinton's mind is a cookbook it's a service to serve the public okay but so they're consolidating around her and to consolidate around her they have to throw Bernie Sanders and his unfortunate age Riddle body they have to throw that sucker right under the bus so Bernie Sanders last night was super pissed you know in California and and he said the struggle continues the struggle does continue let's do this thing is to transform this country and to understand and to understand that we are in this together to understand that all of what we believe is what the majority of the American people believe and to understand that the struggle continues struggling continues we shall overcome by the way there actually is tape left to grab it there is tape of Bernie Sanders actually singing we shall overcome from a CD that he cut when he was the mayor of Burlington Vermont cuz in that case part of the amusement by the way of watching Bernie Sanders tape is that it always appears halfway through the sentence that he might lose his train of thought and just start talking about when he used to play stickball on the streets or something and then he sort of continues so there's always this kind of awkward pause and then you wait for him to just like you're like your grandfather who's a little addled you wait for him to continue on a completely different topic but Bernie Sanders remember he was the darling of the left MSNBC loved him now they're ready to consolidate around Hillary and to Bernie Sanders they have to dig a grave for him and then they have to knock him in the face like Joe Pesci at the end of Cassino and bury him in a cornfield somewhere so here's Rachel Maddow doing exactly that on MSNBC last night or Chris Hayes I can't really tell the difference according to this Politico piece tonight it was senator Sanders himself quote who personally rewrote his campaign managers shorter statement after the chaos of that state party convention the statement that the Sanders campaign put out after Nevada basically said yeah yeah yeah of course Bernie Sanders is against violence but what this was caused by the convention they're blaming senator Sanders for writing that himself quote he was the one who also made the choice to go after DNC chair debbie Wasserman Schultz after his wife read him a transcript of her blasting him on television it was senator Sanders himself who chose as political puts it the knife fight over calling Hillary Clinton unqualified which aides blamed for pulling the bottom out of any hopes they had of winning in New York and when Jimmy Kimmel's producers asked the Sanders campaign for a question to ask Donald Trump Sanders himself wrote the one challenging Donald Trump to a debate so blaming Bernie Sanders himself for all of those the piece also says that Sanders it was is personally responsible for setting the basic tone of the campaign recently which has been and is quoted as screw me no screw you yes I mean and so now you know I you take these end of campaign stories I do with several grains of salt every because you do have to look at the sourcing and you have to then try to fit a standard thinks that progressives who picked Hillary Clinton over him are cynical power chasing chickens like senator sherrod Brown of Ohio one of Bernie Sanders is most consistent allies in the Senate before endorsing Clinton and campaigning hard for her ahead of the Ohio primary Sanders is so bitter about that that he would be ready to nix sherrod Brown as an acceptable VP choice for Clinton if Clinton ever asked his advice on who would be a good progressive champion okay so why Matt I was really upset about this she's very upset at Bernie Sanders why doesn't he just go away why doesn't he just leave us all alone so their romance with Bernie Sanders now they want to consolidate and Sanders has to go away so the Democrats are rallying around there fella they're rallying around their historic felon meanwhile the Republicans are tearing each other apart and they're tearing each other apart because there are people in the Republican Party who look at Donald Trump and they say what the living hell are you doing what the living hell are you doing and it's people who are who are have heretofore been Trump supporters even from his own supporters are now beginning to realize the awkwardness of supporting Trump one Trump supporter Dan Coates of Indiana apparently who's asked what politically what what on policy makes Trump better than Hillary he paused for 11 seconds before he could come up with a response Mitch McConnell who has come out in favor of Donald Trump he was asked by Matt Lewis here you know what should Donald Trump do and here is here's Mitch McConnell I think a good place to start would be to apologize for the various totally inappropriate things he said over the last couple of weeks another thing I'd like to see him do is get on script I think it's time for him to look like a serious candidate for president which means that you need to think before you speak you need to apologize when you make a mistake and get on script he's running for the most important job in the country some in the world and I think there's a certain threshold of credibility that needs to be met I was with him in the green room when he went to the NRA convention in Louisville a couple of weeks ago and I said hey Donnelly we got a script well the table is pocket I said are you going to use it he said I hate the script it's boring I said put me down if they were boring okay well it doesn't matter because he ain't gonna listen to you gang putting putting you down in favor of boring it's not a surprise but he ain't gonna listen to you Hugh Hewitt who's been a real Republican Party loyalist I mean Hugh is is a guy who really believes in Republican Party unity this morning on his radio show he said that they should try to take the nomination away from Trump at the convention even after all the primaries have been ended here is Hewitt it's like ignoring stage forecasts you can't go gotta go tack it and right now the Republican Party is facing the plane is headed towards the mountain after the last 72 hours and you had a Mark Kirk gonna endorse my personal lose anyway I'm not marker pen I don't believe in casting aspersions on him he's just he's not gonna get reelected Lindsey Graham is a very serious student at the world is a with whom I've disagreed often but in the last few years on Isis he's absolutely right and he speaks for a lot of people he says he cannot vote for Donald Trump I've disappointed here that'll talk to Lindsay Graham about that you know I want to support the nominee of the party but I think the party ought to change the nominee cuz we're gonna get killed with this nominee and the I have never said that I waited till after the primary was over they stayed Switzerland at the end and then 72 hours dumb tailed by that they ought to get together and let the convention decide it Donald Trump pulls over and makeover and the next four to five weeks great they can keep them it would be better if he had done so five weeks ago okay it ain't gonna happen they're not gonna take the nomination away from Trump they're not gonna stop it because if they do 40% of the Republican base walks out on them they lose the election anyway and they're seen as people who rejected the popular will yeah all this is to say however all this is to say that Trump because he's basically indefensible Republicans at least have the the strength of principle to struggle with this at least they have the strength of principle to struggle with this I'm often asked about on religious grounds how do you know that you believe in God the answer is I struggle with God's justice and that means I believe in him okay struggling with Donald Trump as the nominee means you actually have some principles just jumping behind him demonstrates they have no principles at all and the Republicans are struggling with this and they ought to be struggling with this the Democrats don't struggle at all because they're all corrupt and terrible I mean this is no matter what you say about Trump Democrats are more corrupt and terrible than Republicans not only are they in favor of mob rule they're also in favor of a nominee who is an open felon an open felon now that said The Wall Street Journal today is ripping on everybody who says that Paul Ryan shouldn't have endorsed Donald Trump there's an editorial in the Wall Street Journal it's just it's legitimately one of the worst editorials I've ever read they basically blame people who are anti Trump for Trump in the first place The Wall Street Journal is more responsible for Trump than people like me okay the people at The Wall Street Journal ignoring illegal immigration pretending that it's nothing bad suggesting that Paul Ryan's immigration plan was some sort of boon and then saying that the only two alternatives in life are Paul Ryan and Donald Trump when Trump wins that means that they have to side behind him I think there's a third way and the third way is neither of those two actual conservatism but there is this tendency now that people have to be coddled into line I don't think it's going to happen okay time for things that I like and then a couple of things that I hate okay things that I like so we're doing sports films and sports books this this week so in terms of sports films this is the one that every man cries out whenever you ask what movie makes a man cry this is always the number-one movie on everybody's list is of course Field of Dreams and here's a little bit of the trailer I have just created something totally illogical just like about what walk in say I hate it when that happens here's your invoices ray is I think I know what if you build it he will come means why do I not think this is such a good thing daddy there's a man up there Neil what do you think it's me Annie it's more than that I feel it as strongly as I've ever felt anything in my life there's a reason okay so it's a great mood if you it's important that maybe Burt Lancaster and James Earl Jones in this great cast Ray Liotta was really young and great in this film and there's one you know there's there's part of the movie that just doesn't fit there's part where they just start rambling about horrible right-wingers in Iowa that makes no sense about a 10-minute interlude in the middle of the film that's really dumb but the rest of the film is really really good and and truly American and the ending of is of course fantastic for anybody who's close to their dad the ending is is great and and so that's that's it's it's very it's it's it's a it's a fun movie to watch and and every guy cries at the end of that film like pretty much every guy cries at the end of that film girls cry at the end of Shopaholic or something but but guys crack deep into cry at the end of Field of Dreams I'll do and I'll say I have another baseball book but I'll save it for I'll save for tomorrow okay the things that I hate so there's a high school boy who is now one a all-state honors as a girl running track here's here's what that looked like yeah we play it fastest 3a girls in the state crossed the finish line of the 100-meter run Haines's nat upon when gapped is among them but Wayne got story is different than any other runner at the state championships she was born a male NAT Afon and her coach declined to comment on this story but outside the stadium members of the Alaska Family Council gather to voice their opinion it is not fair and it is not right for our female athletes and we have a responsibility to protect our girls that have worked really hard that are working toward college scholarships when yet was the third seed in the 100 meter race coming into the weekend just missing the cut Hutchison senior Saskia Harrison I'm glad that this person is comfortable with who they are and they're able to be happy new they are booked competitively I don't think it's completely 100% fair well I think that's an overgeneralization Alaska schools Activities Association executive director Billy Strickland says the a s double a doesn't have a statewide policy for transgender athletes okay so is it it's idiotic okay if you're born a male if you're a biological male you shouldn't be competing against women or why don't we just get rid of the categories entirely and the only people who will be running our men are males okay because transgender male's won't be able to compete with with actual males who are not having hormone treatments right estrogen treatment so this whole thing is incredibly dumb okay last thing that I hate today and now I get to pick on our good friend Lindsey so Lindsey brought this up and she knew that she should not have done this it was a huge mistake because whenever she says stuff like this off the air she knows that I'm immediately going to grab it and use it on the air so what's the name of this guy wasn't it Travis Barker okay Travis Barker is a rock musician and what group is you with okay he was a blink-182 and for those who can't see this for people who can't see this picture of Travis Barker he's tattooed from neck on down I mean he's looks like the Illustrated man from Ray Bradbury he just got tattoos everywhere he's got some tattoos on his face and he looks terrible and so this is a meme of him now you may think that he looks good Lindsey but that's okay that's your weird so you have an odd tastes there are homeless people who look better than this so travis barker is standing there and there's a meme of him and it says this it says quote i tattooed my body so I couldn't fall back on anything I purposely did that so I couldn't get a normal job and live a normal life I did it so I had to play music this makes you a full-scale grade-a moron okay this is the equivalent of some guys like you know what I desperately want to play soccer and I am just to make sure I don't have a fallback position I'm cutting off my arms he's gonna cut them off I don't need you know I need to play soccer I don't want any job you know I may be tempted to jump to drop out of this whole soccer thing and I don't want those arms there to remind there'll be a constant reminder that I need to play soccer it's the only thing I can do all I have his legs now write this this is so stupid the reason this is stupid is because your tattoos you're not guarantee you success in life they guarantee you won't be successful in one area but they don't guarantee you will be successful in another area what made this guy presumably a successful drummer is that he can drum not that he has tattoos right the idea oh I committed myself now now I better learn how to drum are you really that weak-minded you couldn't teach yourself to drop like you didn't realize that you had to learn how to drum to be a drummer until you slathered your body and terrible looking tattoos right when you as you get older and those start to sag you're just gonna start looking like a graffiti cover bench in South Central LA like this it's it's so stupid but this is what people do and I think writ large this is actually a bigger message the bigger message is don't set up obstacles for yourself in the opinion that this makes you more virtuous there are too many people in American society who do this right they they women who get pregnant out of wedlock and then they go oh well you know I did it and look how courageous I am I overcame that to do X you know what have been better if you didn't do that you know it would better if he hadn't gotten the tattoos because guess what you know what happened if this idiot had not been part of a successful man if he'd been like the other millions of people and played in a garage band and then fell and fell apart and never made it big you know what happened I'd be paying for him right he'd be on welfare he couldn't get a job that's the whole point his whole point is that he didn't want to get a normal job and live a normal life right so now your two options are you either make it big as a rock star or I pay for you that's not my decision that's your decision so you get to take away my money cuz you're stupid okay so I'm very glad that this guy made it big and so he's not relying on my money I'm very happy that he's not relying on my money but kids take this as a lesson don't be a moron don't make irreversible decisions that create obstacles for yourself because oh I'm gonna make sure that I'm totally committed I'm totally committed into this career that I've chosen for myself and I have to make sure that I'm committed really just tie like a string around your finger and remind yourself you really have like you really had to go and get under the needle for a thousand years I hate tattoos generally Lindsey knows this I mock her for her tattoo regular basis Lindsay has a tattoo on her wrist that says brave and as I've said unless you were different seen women and men right you know who else has a brave tattoo yang you knows how the brave tattoo the Chewbacca lady she has a brave tattoo also really watch that tape she's sitting behind the Chewbacca masks you raise her arm at one point and I mailed this to Lindsay I said Lindsay these are the kinds of people she's so brave she's so brave because true bravery is not fighting in Normandy true bravery is sitting in a car with a Chewbacca masks and laughing hysterically while you video yourself that is true bravery gang so okay so that that's my little rant against tattoos but even if you're getting a tattoo you even though even though their opinion listen you can get a tattoo that's fine there are plenty of people who have tattoos you know I don't have to like it you don't have to care what I think that's fine but please for the love of God don't do stupid things in your life that prevent you from making decisions later on okay don't pre commit yourself to a course because it may turn out what happens if if the guy got tinnitus and decided you couldn't deal with rock music like what what happens if you pre commit yourself to a course you're 14 years old I want to be an astronaut because I want to be an astronaut I'm going to ensure that I only that I only live in this bubble for the next two years I'm just gonna live in this bubble and then it turns out well you know what the whole astronaut thing didn't work out but now I'm susceptible to every disease on planets I lived in a bubble it's dumb dumb dumb and stuff like think think a little things like the next step in your life gang yeah I think that there a number of young people who got tattoos who are not thinking beyond like the next step because if they thought 40 years down the line particularly women you'd realize how bad these tattoos are gonna look there's no such thing as a good looking tattoo on a 60 year old woman right it's all fun and games when you're 20 and hot okay it's a totally different thing when you're 70 and you look like you smoked six packs a day and you're sitting there without a larynx and you got a tattoo on your arm okay looks totally different then let's just think a little bit down the road gang and and that's that's my my message for the day all right we'll be back tomorrow with the mailbag subscribe to daily wire comm and you can be part of the vaunted ben shapiro show mailbag and join the fun i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
