the team investigating malaysia airlines flight mh17 which was down over eastern ukraine in 2014 has updated the media on its findings admitting they coincide with those of a blogger let's get more a knife from our correspondent Daniel Hawkins hey Dan what's come out of today's update what are we learning well the interesting thing this is the first time that the Dutch Safety Board has actually spoken of concrete and exact blame attribution here of course back in 2050 the Dutch Safety Board according to their investigation confirmed that the mh17 airliner was hit by a buk missile that theory was also confirmed in September 2016 by the joint investigation team a team made up of international aviation experts the Russian side of course has denied this consistently including that 2016 report that was denied by Dmitry Peskov the presidential spokesman for lack of evidence this statement from the Ministry of Defence we have in response to the board has said that the position remains clear that no anti-aircraft weaponry no anti-aircraft vehicles of the type allegedly used in this town and crossed the Russian border and that the Russian side can prove this through providing a radar data showing that no launchers took place from the eastern side and indeed witness statements as well many of which the Ministry of Defence has said were given both the Russian and international media and said that any launch if it did take place took place from the Western control side of the Donbass which at the time of course and still is a very much active war zone this is what minister defense had to say we are concerned that the Dutch investigation decided to base their investigation on images from social media that were edited what's more a number of images that were used at the briefing were prepared by the Ukrainian security services and was shown on a number of occasions by Belling cats we want to draw to everyone's attention that the Dutch investigators have ignored witness accounts many eyewitnesses saw the tragedy themselves they are not images from social media they are real people who gave their testimonies on record to the European and American media as we said earlier of course the previous investigations by the Dutch Safety Board by the JIT focused very much on reconstructing what happened to the plane on its journey from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur how it was brought down what equipment was used not so much on blame attribution precisely and now the team has said they do have persons of interest ranging from several dozen to hundreds that they could be now looking into this is what the JIT had to say on the new developments what if delegates we realized that the Belen cat investigation team already reached the same conclusions and published them we as the joint investigation team have our own independent investigation and the conclusions we draw from it must be based on legal and convincing evidence which will stand in a courtroom now much of that evidence of course as cited by the Russian Ministry of Defense just earlier in this report was based on organizations such as Belen cat a organisation effectively of citizen journalism using open-source data found in the internet photos publicly available from social media etc a lot of that evidence was taken into account both by the Dutch Safety Board investigation and the JIT as well while according to the Russian official defense at least what from what they're saying much of their evidence was either discounted or not given you care and attention in coming to those conclusions let's take a closer look at what evidence exactly was used and where it came from from that Balan cat organization Jude Higgins who runs the website Belling cat is a laid-off admin worker who made a name for himself by analyzing weapons used in the Syrian conflict never been to Syria doesn't speak a word of Arabic conducts is profound research from the comfort of his armchair in his home Higgins himself admits he has no experience in the field before the Arab Spring and you know more about weapons than the average Xbox owner I had no knowledge beyond what I've learned from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rambo his tools of choice for uncovering global conspiracies YouTube and Google Earth billboards in the area kind of look the same but it wasn't really you know this isn't enough to say this is definitely the same area though as you can see the path from the graphs but again it's not a great match so we know the Russians lied and the media loves him Eliot Higgins oddish blogger who's been analyzing the pictures of the wreckage thank you for joining the program but some are questioning his methods like the developer of the photo analysis program which Belling CAD used to claim Moscow faked satellite images and image forensics experts aren't fans either what Belling cat is doing is nothing more than reading tea leaves error level analysis is a method used by hobbyists but fellow obsessives are ecstatic about scrutinizing felling cats analysis vloggers claim he's showing photos of two different buk missile systems in an attempt to prove the weapon came from Russia they say the one pictured in Russia is a newer model because it features a recent modification as for the claim that no Ukrainian books were in the area at the time of the crash well fellow bloggers dug up screenshots from Ukrainian TV apparently showing a buk missile system complete with radar in the area just a few days before the tragedy well we have been in touch with Belling cats which stated that the Russian government and media have resorted to conspiracy theories false claims and fake evidence to cover up the downing of mh17 melon cat then went on to praise its own probe as thorough and accurate when historian and East Europe expert Martin McCauley believes the mh17 investigation is seriously flawed and after four years has not reached any conclusive results two factors which are very important one is the investigators did not have access to the site when the buk missile if it was it was a surface-to-air missile is fired they haven't had access to that site and secondly the investigators said they haven't released all the information that they possess so therefore they're holding back information therefore what we can say is if you like it's like a 400 meter race props you've done 300 meters 350 meters but we still have the final lap the further half lap to go we don't know what the answer to the question is who fire the missile and why was it fired we don't know that yet
