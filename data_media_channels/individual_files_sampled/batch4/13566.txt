Bert and Ernie the well-known Sesame Street puppets there's a big debate on between different writers and creators of them as to whether or not they're gay coincidentally I don't know why this is but in my notes for our interview whoever taped this put a Gay Pride stick around there so we have their vote or Bert and Ernie game Bert and Ernie you know they're a wonderful team and they've provided us so much happiness for so long I don't think they're gay then here's my premise for this the guy who created them said they're not gay and is that all the other yeah well no I can keep no deeper okay they're made of felt okay most gay people are not made of felt they're made of our genders your IRB right something shiny right felt isn't shiny at all puppets don't usually have any genitals no so it's difficult for them to engage in any section you know I don't know I've never taken clothing off of a puppet or use some kind of brick a van over here I'm checking out puppet there was an incident at a party I don't want to go to it drunken administration yeah Miss Piggy was involved it was not pretty but yeah that's an interesting thing is that we have to come up now with sexuality for puppets you know for the guy I was it was actually kind of sad the guy who who kind of brought this to everybody's attention and he said he was a writer I guess for many years for Bert and Ernie which I thought they came up with all their own material and I'm a little frustrated I know it's all they like this guy was Mark Saltzman I think Marc Saltzman and he said he always considered them gay and he wrote them as if they were gay and he modeled them after his own relationship and he's gay hmm but I thought that was really sad because Bert and Ernie sleep in separate beds is this guy what what's happening at the house I'm late I I think he's got the right idea yeah I want to stretch out I don't need somebody rolling over on to me and I separate beds is flying separate California kings I mean yes well that's the problem I think they had twins like you're an adult yeah I you know I know you're on a kids show I believe Bert and Ernie were full full-grown I don't believe they're ever getting any taller so I you know I think that the twin bed thing was a little rough it's just that it's just like I we can't you know Glenn's book he's out here to Pronovias book and a gin to outrage and it's like this is the typical thing the typical nonsense we have to get excited about every day
