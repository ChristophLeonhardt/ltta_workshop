weeks on end Italy dominated headlines last stronghold of jihadists al-qaeda rebels and the Syrian army was poised determined to end them it would have been messy would have shown the entire world is following our meeting the statement that we're going to make after the talks may bring hope to the region the presidents of Russia and Turkey spent almost five hours closeted away working out a deal that wouldn't plung'd Lib into bloody chaos a deal to avert a military operation a peace deal trillium we have decided to create a demilitarized zone along the battle line by the 15th of October it will be between 15 and 20 kilometers wide we will move radicalized militants out of the zone including Jabbar al-nusra together with Russia we will make maximum effort to get rid of all radical groups from this territory Turkey and Russia will both patrol this territory to ensure compliance the gist of it is getting radical Islamists al Qaeda in Syria 4-1 away from the front lines withdrawing heavy weapons artillery tanks to make sure ichi fingers don't spark any more escalations opening up the roads allowing travel through contested territories for civilians and Russian Turkish troops would oversee it all patrol this demilitarized zone but there are concerns that mr.
