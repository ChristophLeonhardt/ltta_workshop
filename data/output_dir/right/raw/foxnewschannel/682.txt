1
00:00:03,216 --> 00:00:07,152
DIVE AND SWIM THEIR WAY OUT.

2
00:00:07,153 --> 00:00:08,787
>> MAYBE SOMEDAY IT WILL BE TO

3
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:17,496
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX QUESTION.

4
00:00:17,497 --> 00:00:18,831
ROE VERSUS WADE ARE THE ONE

5
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:19,798
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN

6
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:21,133
TERMS OF HAVING AN EFFECT.

7
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:22,367
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

8
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:23,769
BUT IT COULD VERY WELL END UP

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,604
WITH STATES AT SOME POINT.

10
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:28,173
>> Eric: THAT'S PRESIDENT TRUMP

11
00:00:28,174 --> 00:00:30,142
IN HIS EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH

12
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:31,910
MARIA BARTIROMO SAYING HE IS

13
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:34,613
NOT LIKELY TO ASK NOMINEES

14
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:40,586
IF ELECTED HE WOULD APPOINT

15
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:41,720
JUDGES WHO WOULD REVERSE AND

16
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:44,490
PUT AN END TO THE HISTORIC

17
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:44,990
ABORTION RULING.

18
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:48,694
LEAVING MANY CONCERN ABOUT WHAT

19
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:52,731
THIS OPEN SEAT COULD MEAN FOR

20
00:00:52,732 --> 00:00:54,366
WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.

21
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:55,300
GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE IS WITH

22
00:00:57,971 --> 00:00:59,304
EVENTUALLY BEING OVERTURNED OR

23
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:02,808
DO YOU THINK THE SUPPORTERS WHO

24
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:05,577
ARE -- THE PRO-CHOICE

25
00:01:05,578 --> 00:01:06,311
SUPPORTERS ARE UNJUSTIFIED IN

26
00:01:06,312 --> 00:01:08,347
THEIR FEARS?

27
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:11,316
>> I HAVE A HOPE THAT'S BIGGER

28
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:12,751
THAN ROE VERSUS WADE BEING

29
00:01:12,752 --> 00:01:13,151
OVERTURNED.

30
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:14,853
IT TURNS IT BACK TO THE STATES.

31
00:01:14,854 --> 00:01:16,488
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LEGALITY

32
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:18,257
OF ABORTION, IT JUST MEANS THAT

33
00:01:18,258 --> 00:01:20,292
DECISION WOULD BE LEFT TO THE

34
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:21,193
STATES, WHICH FRANKLY, ERIC, IS

35
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:22,828
WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

36
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:23,161
ANYWAY.

37
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:25,998
THERE IS NO MENTION OF ABORTION

38
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:27,165
OR WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS

39
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,501
IN THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH IS

40
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:30,802
THE LIMITATION OF THE FEDERAL

41
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:31,203
GOVERNMENT.

42
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:33,572
WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS

43
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:34,907
A DISCUSSION ON PERSONHOOD.

44
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:36,708
THE QUESTION IS NOT IS ABORTION

45
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,176
OKAY OR NOT OKAY.

46
00:01:38,177 --> 00:01:40,279
THE QUESTION IS, IS THE UNBORN

47
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,213
CHILD A PERSON?

48
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:43,115
IF IT IS SO, AT WHAT POINT?

49
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:45,684
IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THAT

50
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:51,323
THAT SHOULD BE INVOKED.

51
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:53,458
THAT PERSON IS ENTITLED TO DUE

52
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,261
PROCESS BEFORE HE OR SHE LOSES

53
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:56,962
LIFE OR LIBERTY.

54
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,900
THEY ARE TERMINATED IN LIFE AND

55
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:03,936
LIBERTY BY THE SINGLE DECISION

56
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:06,605
OF THE BIRTH MOTHER.

57
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:07,573
THAT'S NOT PROTECTING THE

58
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:09,441
RIGHTS OF THOSE PERSONS.

59
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:11,510
>> Sandra: GOVERNOR, THE PRESS

60
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:12,444
SECRETARY, YOUR DAUGHTER, WAS

61
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:17,749
EXACTLY IS THE PRESIDENT

62
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,750
LOOKING FOR IN HIS SUPREME

63
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:26,191
>> THE MAIN THING THE PRESIDENT

64
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:30,596
IS LOOKING FOR ARE PEOPLE THAT

65
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:31,930
FIT THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT YOU

66
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:35,601
WOULD WANT IN A SUPREME COURT

67
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:36,535
JUSTICE, TREMENDOUS INTELLECT,

68
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:38,737
SOMEONE WHO WILL STICK TO

69
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:40,305
UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTION AND

70
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:41,907
SOMEBODY WHO HAS GREAT JUDICIAL

71
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:42,307
TEMPERAMENT.

72
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:43,375
THOSE ARE THE BIG THINGS THE

73
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:44,376
PRESIDENT IS LOOKING FOR IN A

74
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:44,776
CANDIDATE.

75
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:47,379
>> Sandra: HE HAS A BIG JOB TO

76
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,113
DO.

77
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:52,150
THE WHITE HOUSE.

78
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:53,785
>> IT'S A VERY SMART YOUNG LADY

79
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:54,987
YOU JUST HAD ON.

80
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:57,255
I THINK SHE IS SPOT ON WHEN IT

81
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:01,827
I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME I'M

82
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:04,196
NOT INTERESTED IN THE

83
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:04,863
APPOINTING A CONSERVATIVE

84
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:07,666
JUSTICE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

85
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,534
THE PERSON TO BE IDEOLOGICAL.

86
00:03:09,535 --> 00:03:11,470
I WANT HIM TO BE SOMEBODY WHO

87
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:13,472
IS PURE TO THE ORIGINAL WORDS

88
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:15,340
AND TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION.

89
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:18,176
IF A PERSON COMES WITH AN

90
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:19,111
IDEOLOGICAL BENT LIBERAL OR

91
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:20,278
CONSERVATIVE THEY WILL BE

92
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:21,980
LOOKING AT THINGS AS IF TO

93
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:23,982
LEGISLATE FROM THE COURTS.

94
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:26,318
WE HAVE A LEGISLATIVE BODY

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:26,818
CALLED CONGRESS.

96
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,620
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH HAS NO

97
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:30,522
RIGHT WHATSOEVER UNDER THE

98
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:31,657
CONSTITUTION TO LEGISLATE

99
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:33,258
ANYTHING TO ORIGINATE A LAW AND

100
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:35,260
WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO WILL BE A

101
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:38,497
I HOPE THE PRESIDENT STICKS TO

102
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:38,797
THAT.

103
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:39,598
I THINK HE WILL.

104
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,700
I THINK THE NAMES ON HIS LIST

105
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,269
ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTED TO

106
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,203
THAT.

107
00:03:45,204 --> 00:03:50,208
>> Eric: WHO JUMPS OUT AT YOU?

108
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:56,381
INTERVIEWING HERE TODAY.

109
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:59,418
>> ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE LIST

110
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:00,819
HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL.

111
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,155
I LIKE AMY CONEY BARRETT AS A

112
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:03,655
POTENTIAL NOMINEE.

113
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:06,892
I THINK SHE WOULD BE TERRIFIC.

114
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:09,561
ANY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE.

115
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:11,563
THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN VETTED AND

116
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:12,698
LOOKED AT BY THEIR EXPERIENCE

117
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:16,635
UP TO PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING

118
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,770
EXCEPT THE FACT WE HAVE TO

119
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:20,405
ACCEPT THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL

120
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:23,108
OPPOSE ANY PERSON THAT THE

121
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:24,776
PRESIDENT PUTS FORWARD AND

122
00:04:24,777 --> 00:04:26,178
WHOEVER PUTS FORWARD -- I DO

123
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:29,281
NOT ENVY THEM GOING INTO THAT

124
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:29,681
LION'S DEN.

125
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:31,283
THEY NEED TO GO INTO THE

126
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:32,918
HEARING ROOM WITH A PISTOL,

127
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:33,385
CHAIR AND WHIP.

128
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:35,287
THEY'LL NEED IT WHEN THEY ARE

129
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:37,155
FACING THOSE DEMOCRATS ON THE

130
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:38,757
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

131
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:40,358
>> Sandra: THE PRESS SECRETARY

132
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,360
CONFIRMED BIG NEWS THAT MIKE

133
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:42,961
POMPEO, THE PRESIDENT'S

134
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:50,368
THE HOLIDAY, ON HIS WAY TO

135
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:53,505
PYONGYANG TO MEET WITH NORTH

136
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:53,805
KOREA.

137
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:55,841
WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE WHITE

138
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:56,508
HOUSE HERE?

139
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:59,277
THIS WILL BE THE THIRD TRIP FOR

140
00:04:59,278 --> 00:05:01,613
MIKE POMPEO TO THAT REGION.

141
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:03,682
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY INSIDE

142
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:04,649
INFORMATION SO I'M JUST

143
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,854
PRESIDENT TOLD ME WHEN I

144
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:09,988
INTERVIEWED HIM FOR A

145
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:11,156
TELEVISION SHOW A WEEK AGO.

146
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:12,791
HERE IS WHAT I THINK IS

147
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:13,158
HAPPENING.

148
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,693
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO MAKE

149
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:16,361
IT VERY CLEAR THROUGH MIKE

150
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:17,529
POMPEO TO THE NORTH KOREANS.

151
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,332
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO

152
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,266
DENUCLEARIZE, EITHER YOU WILL

153
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:22,868
DO IT OR YOU'RE NOT.

154
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:25,203
IF YOU WON'T DO IT VOLUNTARILY

155
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:26,171
WE'LL DO IT FOR YOU.

156
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:28,140
IT WILL BE A VERY STERN AND

157
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:29,708
SERIOUS MESSAGE THAT THIS IS

158
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,576
NOT A GAME.

159
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:33,979
WE ARE NOT THE OBAMA OR

160
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,747
CLINTONS OR THE BUSHES.

161
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:37,215
THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION

162
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:39,284
PREPARED TO DO WHATEVER IT

163
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:40,752
TAKES TO KEEP THAT PENINSULA

164
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,456
AS LONG AS NORTH KOREA IS

165
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:45,390
DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

166
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,259
I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE

167
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,493
SECRETARY OF STATE WILL BE

168
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:50,162
SAYING TO KIM JONG-UN.

169
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:57,235
>> Eric: WHAT IF THERE IS NO

170
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:58,503
TIMETABLE, KIM JONG-UN DOES NOT

171
00:05:58,504 --> 00:05:59,404
PROVIDE THE INFORMATION?

172
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:01,239
WHAT DO WE DO THEN?

173
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:09,481
WATCH AND TELLS HIM THE TIME IS

174
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:09,815
TICKING.

175
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:11,850
BEFORE THE BATTERY RUNS OUT HE

176
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:13,652
BETTER HAVE THINGS UNDERWAY

177
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:17,923
WE AREN'T GOING TO LET THIS

178
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:21,159
EXTEND INTO THE TERM OF ANOTHER

179
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,761
PRESIDENT IN ANOTHER 6 1/2

180
00:06:24,897 --> 00:06:25,764
ABOUT IT.

181
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:29,467
IF HE IS NOT BUCKLE UP AND GET

182
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:30,635
READY.

183
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:32,604
THERE WILL BE SERIOUS

184
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:33,205
REPERCUSSIONS INCLUDING

185
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:33,805
MILITARY REPERCUSSIONS.

186
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:41,847
WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD

187
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:42,547
BEFORE.

188
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:43,949
>> I DON'T TRUST FOR HIM THAT

189
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,116
THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE DOES BUT

190
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:46,751
HERE IS WHAT I KNOW.

191
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:48,153
IF HE IS AS SMART AS THE

192
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:49,988
PRESIDENT BELIEVES HIM TO BE,

193
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:52,123
IF HE IS THAT PERCEPTIVE HE

194
00:06:52,124 --> 00:06:53,758
WILL PICK UP ON THE FACT THIS

195
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,160
IS A PRESIDENT NOT AFRAID TO DO

196
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:55,627
WHAT HE SAYS.

197
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:57,162
ONE THING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP

198
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:58,563
THAT EVEN HIS ENEMIES WOULD

199
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:00,432
HAVE TO ACCEPT, HE IS A PERSON

200
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:03,301
THAT ENDS UP DOING WHAT HE

201
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:07,572
JERUSALEM, WHETHER IT'S TAX

202
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:09,241
CUTS, WHETHER IT'S ENFORCING

203
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:09,708
THE BORDER.

204
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,510
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO WHEN HE

205
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:14,279
SAYS SOMETHING ENDS UP DOING IT.

206
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,814
THAT'S THE BIGGEST SHOCK TO THE

207
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:16,514
POLITICAL WORLD.

208
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:17,916
HE IS NOT KIDDING AND MAYBE

209
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:19,317
THEY ARE GETTING THAT MESSAGE.

210
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:26,524
THE PRESIDENT IS AHEAD OF US.

211
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:27,926
>> Sandra: HE HAS MORE

212
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,327
INTERVIEWS ON HIS PLATE THIS

213
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:29,628
WEEK.

214
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:31,696
I'LL END WITH THIS.

215
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:32,864
THE PRESIDENT TWEETING A LOT

216
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:34,266
THIS MORNING ON NORTH KOREA HE

217
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,368
TALKS ABOUT THE MANY GOOD

218
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:37,769
CONVERSATIONS THAT HE IS HAVING

219
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,941
WITH NORTH KOREA GOING WELL,

220
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:44,809
MEANTIME NO ROCKET LAUNCHES OR

221
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,678
NUCLEAR TESTING IN EIGHT MONTHS.

222
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,713
ALL OF ASIA IS THRILLED.

223
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:49,381
ONLY THE OPPOSITION PARTY

224
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:50,882
INCLUDING THE FAKE NEWS IS

225
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:51,283
COMPLAINING.

226
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:52,751
IF NOT FOR ME WE WOULD NOW BE

227
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:53,952
AT WAR WITH NORTH KOREA.

228
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:56,288
ARE WE A LONG WAY FROM WHERE WE

229
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:58,156
WERE JUST SEVERAL MONTHS AGO

230
00:07:58,157 --> 00:07:59,524
BEFORE THE SUMMIT EVER TOOK

231
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:00,225
PLACE?

232
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,626
>> WELL, WE CLEARLY ARE.

233
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:07,966
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THE ROCKET'S

234
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,868
RED GLARE OVER THE PENINSULA

235
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:10,235
RIGHT NOW.

236
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:11,469
THAT'S A GOOD STEP.

237
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,104
WE'RE NOT WHERE WE NEED TO BE.

238
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:14,973
THE SECRETARY OF STATE WILL

239
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:17,309
CONVEY THAT WHEN HE FACES KIM

240
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:17,842
JONG-UN PERSONALLY.

241
00:08:17,843 --> 00:08:20,145
YES, WE'RE BETTER OFF.

242
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:21,813
JUST HAVING CONVERSATION IS

243
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:22,314
BETTER OFF.

244
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:22,981
GETTING SOME CONCESSIONS.

245
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:26,885
NOW THEY HAVE TO LIVE UP TO IT.

246
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:28,987
I THINK -- LET'S PUT IT THIS

247
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:31,389
WAY, THEY WILL HAVE HELL TO PAY

248
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,258
IF THEY DON'T.

249
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:35,560
>> Eric: ARE THOSE SARAH'S BABY

250
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:36,528
PICTURES OVER YOUR RIGHT

251
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,163
SHOULDER OR GRANDCHILDREN?

252
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:42,634
>> SOME OF THEM ARE SARAH'S

253
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:44,736
BABY PICTURES, SOME ARE MY SONS.

254
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:46,404
MY HOUSE AND OFFICE ARE FILLED

255
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:48,473
WITH PICTURES OF SIX GRANDKIDS

256
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:50,842
WHO HAPPEN TO BE OBJECTIVELY

257
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:52,444
SPEAKING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

258
00:08:52,445 --> 00:00:00,000
GRANDCHILDREN IN THE WORLD,
