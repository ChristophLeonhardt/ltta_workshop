as millions of Americans prepare for hurricane Florence the president is still praising his response to millions of Americans who were devastated by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last fall I think where Rico was incredibly successful Puerto Rico was actually our toughest one of all because it's an island so you did you can't truck things onto it everything's by boat we moved to hospital into Puerto Rico a tremendous military hospital in the form of a ship you know that and I actually think that the governor's been very nice in two Bs the governor he'll tell you what a great job I think probably the hardest one we had by far was Puerto Rico because of the island nature and I actually think it was one of the best jobs that's ever been done with respect to what this is all about the job that FEMA and law enforcement and everybody get working along with the governor in Puerto Rico I think was tremendous I think the Puerto Rico was an incredible unsung success a boat in the form of a ship an unsung success those numbers that you saw on the screen that was the number of Americans killed in Puerto Rico so for facts sake mr. president let's please take a look at what your incredible unsung success looks like from the ground September 20th 2017 Maria's slammed into Puerto Rico with 155 mile-per-hour winds a meteorologist told Fox it was like a 50 or 60 mile wind wide tornado that raged across the island like a buzz saw then the power went out so let's just leave the lights out for the rest of this segment when the storm was over there was complete devastation remote areas were completely cut off without power you know problems quickly mount water cannot be pumped into homes no no showers and toilets well they won't flush sewage cannot be pumped out of entire neighborhoods but people they need water so they have to drink what they can Americans were forced to drink from contaminated streams is that success mr. president without power or clean water diseases they begin to spray wounds cannot be cleaned especially when medicine is in very short supply FEMA in its effort to respond gave out two hundred thousand meals per day that sounds like a lot right it wasn't even close to the two million meals needed imagine mr. president families standing in line hoping to be the lucky one in ten that actually gets food and that is if they were near a Fema camp in the first place is that what success looks like mr. president adding to the suffering the bodies that need to be buried so people apply for FEMA burial aid but new data shows only 75 out of the 2431 requests for funeral assistance were even approved and to get that assistance a death certificate showing the person died as part of a disaster is needed how about that President Trump is that what you call successful but until last month the official death count it was only 64 people mr. president that is just a few dozen more when you said this every death is a horror but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died and you look at what happened here with really a storm that was just totally overpowering nobody's ever seen anything like this 16 versus literally thousands of people you can be very proud everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what's taking place but now that number is officially 2975 people is that a real catastrophe yet well imagine if this happened in Wisconsin Missouri Delaware would 3.4 million Americans be left to suffer for an entire year so no mr. president that is not success and it is truly mind-boggling that you would even say that to Rick Santorum who said blame it on that country Puerto Rico Puerto Rico is a u.s. territory you do not need a passport to get they're those people can vote so no it is not a separate country they are not our neighbor they're our family hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest interviews and highlights you can get more MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
