14
00:00:29,517 --> 00:00:29,850

HE WAS FIRED IN MARCH, REMEMBER

29
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:54,508
FOR LEAKING INFORMATION

30
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:57,545
IMPROPERLY TO THE MEDIA AND THEN

31
00:00:57,545 --> 00:00:58,279

00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:00,448

88
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:28,602
THINGS HAVE LEAKED OUT THAT AT

89
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:29,937
ONE POINT THERE IS A SUGGESTION

90
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:31,439
THAT JAMES COMEY WAS

91
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,407
INSUBORDINATE IN THE WAY THAT HE

92
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:34,408
DEALT WITH THE EMAIL

93
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:35,443
INVESTIGATION AND A LOT MORE IS

94
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:37,411
GOING TO COME OUT ON THAT.

95
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:37,978
ANOTHER STORY THAT IS

96
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:40,815
PERCOLATING OUT THERE TONIGHT IS

97
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:42,183
AN INSIDE LOOK AT SOME OF THE

98
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:44,452
SORT OF SMALL GROUP MEETINGS

99
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:45,052
BETWEEN THE HOUSE INTEL

100
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:48,456
COMMITTEE LEADERSHIP AND ROD

101
00:02:48,456 --> 00:02:49,156
ROSENSTEIN'S FOLKS, INCLUDING

102
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:51,659
ROB ROSENSTEIN HIMSELF, THAT

103
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,227
THESE HAVE, I'M HEARING ON MORE

104
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:55,463
THAN ONE OCCASION, IN FACT ON

105
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:58,032
MANY OCCASIONS, DEVOLVED INTO

00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:01,635
LAST AS LONG AS 30 MINUTES.

108
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:03,437
AND THAT HE HAS BASICALLY

109
00:03:03,437 --> 00:03:04,238
THREATENED TO SUBPOENA THEM FOR

110
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:06,173
THEIR EMAILS AND THEIR DOCUMENTS

111
00:03:06,173 --> 00:03:06,941
BECAUSE HE'S ANGRY THAT THEY ARE

112
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,878
ASKING HIM FOR SO MUCH.

113
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:11,378

FIRING LINE.

119
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,487
THE PRESIDENT AND OTHERS GOING

120
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:20,888

ROBERT MUELLER.

122
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:22,623
HE OVERSEES THE DOCUMENTS AT THE

123
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:25,493
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THERE SINCE

124
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:26,594

130
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:34,935
SPY EMBEDDED IN THE TRUMP

131
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:36,203
