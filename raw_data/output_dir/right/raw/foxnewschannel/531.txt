00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:19,027
ABOUT THE CLAIM.

80
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:21,029
HE DESCRIBED IT AS BEING PART OF

81
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:22,564
AN EMPHASIS, EPISODE OF THE

82
00:02:22,564 --> 00:02:23,065
TWILIGHT ZONE.

83
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:24,867
IN THE COMING DAYS WE WILL HAVE

00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:26,268
TIME TO CAREFULLY ASSESS ALL OF

85
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:27,236
THESE CLAIMS AND THE MANY

86
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:30,305
COUNTERCLAIMS IN THE STORY AND

QUESTIONS AND SEVERAL COME TO

MIND.

92
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:37,179
HERE'S THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE.

93
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:40,449
WHAT EXACTLY IS THEM ALLOCATION

94
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,017
HERE IN THIS NEW CLAIM?

95
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:45,053
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL DID NOT

96
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:45,821
HESITATE TO GIVE HIS ASSESSMENT

97
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:47,222
OF WHAT IT IS.

99
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,894
FIRST TIME AS A SWORN AFFIDAVIT

00:02:51,894 --> 00:02:52,561
THAT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIES

101

BRETT KAVANAUGH AS SEEMINGLY

102
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:01,937
RATING A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN

103
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:03,973
DRUGGED.

104
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:15,284
>> Tucker: SEEMINGLY SAID

SENATOR BLUMENTHAL.

106
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:20,389
SHE CLAIMS SOMEONE ELSE HER, AND

107
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:24,727
SO WHO EXACTLY IS THIS PERSON.

108
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:26,996
NONE OF THAT IS CLEAR FROM HER

109
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:30,633
ACCOUNT WHICH IS DOES MORE

110
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:32,268
SUGGESTING THAN IT DOES STATING.

111
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:33,869
SHE DOES CLAIM THAT SHE HERSELF

112
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:35,171
WAS BY A NUMBER OF BOYS.

113
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:38,441
WAS IT CAVANAUGH AMONG, AMONG

114
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:38,741
THEM?

115
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:41,477
WE DON'T KNOW.

116
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:43,846
WHICH ITSELF RAISES ANOTHER

117
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:45,348
QUESTION, WHY DOESN'T HER

118
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:46,749
STATEMENT SPELL OUT CLEARLY WHAT

119
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:48,050
SHE CLAIMS KAVANAUGH DEAD.

120
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,453
WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT A

121
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:51,854
ACCORDING TO JULIE SWETNICK,

122
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:54,056
HORRIBLE THINGS HAPPENED IN A

123
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:55,458
SERIES OF PARTIES IN SUBURBAN

124
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,093
MARYLAND IN THE 1980s.

125
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:59,829
NOT TALKING DRUNKEN NAUGHTINESS,

126
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,297
THESE ARE WAR LEVEL CLIENT

127
00:04:01,297 --> 00:04:01,998

128
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:05,067
GROUPS OF YOUNG WOMEN DRUGGED

129
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,836
AND GANG, IT'S HORRIFYING.

130
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:12,975
SO WHY HASN'T ANYONE TAKEN US TO

131
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:13,509
LAW ENFORCEMENT?

132
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:17,447
DID HE CONTACT A MARYLAND POLICE

133
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:18,680
FIRST, THEY ARE THE ONES WITH

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,649
JURISDICTION HERE.

135
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,149
IS IT THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE

136
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:21,884
SEEN THESE ALLEGATIONS?

137
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:24,687
AND IF IT IS THE FIRST TIME, HOW

138
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:26,055
CAN THAT BE?

139
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:28,224
SHE DESCRIBES ATTENDING AT LEAST

143
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:37,467
DID ANY OF THE MANY PEOPLE AT

00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:40,704
THESE RATE SCENES MENTIONED

145
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:45,308
THESE CRIMES TO POLICE, THEN OR

146
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:47,043
IN YEARS SENSE?

147
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:49,112
WASHINGTON IS A VERY SMALL

148
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:49,412
PLACE.

149
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:52,215
AMONG THE PERMANENT POPULATION

150
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:53,850
HERE, EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE OR

151
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,417
KNOW SOMEONE WHO DOES.

152
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:56,720
SO WHERE ARE ALL THE WITNESSES

153
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,354
TO THIS?

154
00:04:57,354 --> 00:04:59,089
WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

155
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:01,091
SPOKEN TO WITNESSES ABOUT IT

156
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:03,460
OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS?

157
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,495
DID SHE OR HERSELF TELL ANYONE

158
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:06,730
OVER THAT TIME?

159
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,497
BETH WILKINSON RAISED THESE

160
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:10,267
QUESTIONS TODAY.

161
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,669
>> I HAVE HAD PEOPLE CALL ME AND

162
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,037
EMAIL ME SAYING THEY KNOW HIM,

163
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:16,239
THEY WERE AT THE PARTIES,

164
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:17,007
THEY'VE NEVER MET HER AND NEVER

165
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:21,244
SEEN HER.

166
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:22,245
IF THIS WAS HAPPENING OVER TWO

167
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:23,847
YEARS WITH ALL THESE WOMEN AND

168
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:25,148
ALL THESE MEN, SOMEONE ELSE

169
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:28,018
WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT AND

170
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:30,553
WOULD HAVE REPORTED IT BY NOW.

171
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:32,088
>> Tucker: AFFAIR QUESTIONS.

172
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:33,156
WHAT'S THE ANSWER?

173
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:35,592
AND BY THE WAY, WHAT WAS JULIE

174
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:39,796
SWETNICK DOING AT THESE PARTIES?

175
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:40,864
SHE GRADUATED IN 1980 WHICH

176
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:43,233
MEANT SHE WOULD BE IN COLLEGE

177
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,268
WHEN THE PARTY TOOK PLACE AND

178
00:05:45,268 --> 00:05:45,869
YET SHE WENT PARTIES TO

179
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:48,372
HIGH SCHOOL KIDS.

180
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:52,876
AT THESE PARTIES SHE SAW

181
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:57,047
HORRIFIC RAPES, AND SHE NEVER

182
00:05:57,047 --> 00:05:58,048
REPORTED THEM TO POLICE.

183
00:05:58,048 --> 00:05:59,583
MOST BAFFLING OF ALL, HOW DID

184
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:03,186
THE FBI MISSED THE FACT THAT

185
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:09,126
KAVANAUGH WAS PART OF A HUGE

186
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:09,426
RING?

187
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:11,261
HE'S HAD SIX FEDERAL BACKGROUND

188
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:12,863
CHECKS AND STAFF SECRETARY, HE

189
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:13,997
HAD THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE

190
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:14,998
SECURITY CLEARANCE, ONE THAT

191
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:17,501
ALLOWED HIM ACCESS TO THIS

192
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:18,468
COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR CODES.

193
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:20,837
FBI AGENTS WOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO

194
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:21,638
HUGE VARIETY OF PEOPLE WHO KNEW

195
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:24,274
OR KNEW OF AND KAVANAUGH DURING

196
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:26,276
HIS HIGH SCHOOL YEARS AND YET

197
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:27,477
NOT ONE OF THEM MENTIONED HE WAS

198
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:30,681
A SERIAL WHO COMMITTED HIS IN

199
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,481
ROOMS OF CLASSMATES.

200
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,283
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

201
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:36,053
AND IF IT DID HAPPEN WE KNOW

202
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:37,454
THAT FBI INVESTIGATORS ARE

203
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:38,655
CRIMINALLY INCOMPETENT.

204
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:40,090
SO INCOMPETENT THEY MISS A

205
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:40,724
GLARING FACT LIKE THAT.

206
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:42,593
SO WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO

207
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:47,264
REINVEST KAVANAUGH SEVENTH TIME?

208
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:48,699
MANY PEOPLE WONDER ABOUT ALL

209
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,467
THIS, BUT NOT THE MEDIA.

210
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:53,070
HOW DARE THEY ASK, THEY SOLD,

211
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,873
QUESTIONS ARE FORBIDDEN HERE.

212
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,475
>> WHEN YOU HEAR LINDSEY GRAHAM,

213
00:06:58,475 --> 00:06:59,443
A SITTING SENATOR SAY THINGS

214
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:00,811
LIKE I FIND IT CURIOUS THAT

215
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:01,879
THESE CHARGES WERE NOT BROUGHT

216
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,715
FORWARD UNTIL 2018, COME ON.

217
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,884
>> AND IT'S MORE THAN THAT HE

218
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,918
SAID, I HOPE PEOPLE WILL BE

219
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:09,353
HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE

220
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:13,123
ALLEGATION BECAUSE WHY WOULD SHE

221
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:14,225
GO TO TEN PARTIES, WHY WOULD SHE

222
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,659
CONTINUE TO HANG AROUND PEOPLE

223
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:16,026
LIKE THIS?

224
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:17,261
IF YOU TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE

225
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:18,529
WORLD OF THE PEOPLE THAT

226
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:21,232
ADVOCATE FOR VICTIMS AND

227
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,467
SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND

228
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:25,369
SEXUAL ASSAULT, THEY CALL THIS

229
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:28,272
VICTIM BLAMING.

230
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:29,273
>> Tucker: THEY CALL IT VICTIM

231
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:30,674
BLAMING, BUT IT DEPENDS ON WHO

232
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:32,476
YOU THINK THE VICTIM IS.

233
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:33,210
DUMB PEOPLE ON TELEVISION HAVE

234
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,278
ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MINDS

235
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:35,679
ABOUT THAT AND THEY WOULD LIKE

236
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,514
YOU TO SHUT UP.

237
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:38,682
BUT THERE'S NO REASON YOU

238
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:40,284
SHOULD, OR AN AMERICAN CITIZEN

239
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:41,519
AND IT'S YOUR COUNTRY.

240
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,521
IT'S YOUR SUPREME COURT AND YOUR

241
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:44,088
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

242
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,289
IT DOESN'T BELONG TO CABLE NEWS

243
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:47,324
ANCHORS OR CREEPY LAWYERS OR

244
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:48,025
U.S. SENATORS WHO HAVE DECIDED

245
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:50,861
TO GIVE UP ON DUE PROCESS AND

246
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:52,863
INSTEAD WOULD LIKE TO ROBE

247
00:07:52,863 --> 00:00:00,000
ACCUSATION AND SCREAMING.
