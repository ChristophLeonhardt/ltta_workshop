1
00:00:01,611 --> 00:00:03,046
QUESTIONS ON THAT MATTER OR

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:04,647
ANYTHING BESIDES THE WALL

3
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:05,014
ISSUES.

4
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:06,716
WE'LL BE WAITING FOR THAT AHEAD

5
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:07,216
OF THAT.

6
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:09,419
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET A READ

7
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:11,454
OF THIS OF WHAT IS AT STAKE

8
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:11,888
HERE.

9
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:16,392
LISA IS A MIDDLE EAST ANALYST

10
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:17,393
LOOKING AT THIS AND SEPARATE

11
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:18,828
REPORTS THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL

12
00:00:18,828 --> 00:00:20,797
MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON IRAN

13
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:21,164
TOMORROW.

14
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:23,199
WE'RE TOLD RIGHT NOW THAT HE

15
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,636
LEANS, ALTHOUGH THAT COULD

16
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:30,907
CHANGE, TOWARD NIXING THE DEAL

17
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:34,110
AND NOT JUST FIXING THE DEAL.

18
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,045
IF THAT IS THE CASE, THEN WHAT?

19
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:37,880
>> YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PRESIDENT

20
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,215
THAT HAS PRESIDENT BEEN SHY

21
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:40,616
COMMUNICATING THE FACT THAT THIS

22
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:41,784
DEAL IS AN AWFUL DEAL.

23
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:42,752
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THIS

24
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,252
PRESIDENT WORKS.

25
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,455
WE HAVE JOHN KERRY, AT THE VERY

26
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:48,891
BEST IS TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE

27
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:51,427
POLICY SET FORTH BY THE CURRENT

28
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:51,894
ADMINISTRATION.

29
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:53,596
AT THE VERY WORST, SOMETHING

30
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:55,131
ELSE AT PLAY.

31
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:56,365
WITH REGARDS TO DONALD TRUMP,

32
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:58,034
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHETHER HE

33
00:00:58,034 --> 00:01:00,336
WILL NIX OR FIX THIS DEAL.

34
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:02,171
WHAT WE DO KNOW HE WILL USE

35
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:03,873
LEVERAGE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE TO

36
00:01:03,873 --> 00:01:05,875
GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE

37
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,911
IRANIANS AT THIS MOMENT AND

38
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:11,547
PIGGYBACK ON THE SENTIMENTS OF

39
00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:11,881
OTHERS.

40
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:13,983
YOU HAD MACRON, ANGELA MERKEL

41
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:15,918
COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

42
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:17,787
THEY EXPRESSED THE FACT THAT THE

43
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:19,489
DEAL IS NOT WORKING.

44
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:21,390
IN ADDITION THAT WE SHOULD KEEP

45
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,392
THE DEAL IN PLACE, IT'S NOT

46
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:23,726
WORKING.

47
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:24,694
>> Neil: I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

48
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:27,396
THEY HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT AND

49
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:29,632
FRUSTRATED WITH IT, BUT THEY

50
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,234
THINK TO RIP IT UP WOULD BE A

51
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:31,701
BAD IDEA.

52
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:32,835
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT

53
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:33,569
CAN DO.

54
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:37,106
HE WILL SURPRISE YOU.

55
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:38,141
EXPECTATIONS CAN CHANGE.

56
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:40,810
IF HE WERE TO RIP IT UP, PEOPLE

57
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,579
ARE EXCUSING THAT FOR OIL PRICES

58
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,314
TO GO HIGH, BUT ON THE BELIEF

59
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,217
THIS WILL LEAD TO DISCORD IN THE

60
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:48,951
MIDDLE EAST.

61
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:49,952
YOU THINK IT WILL?

62
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:51,287
>> I DON'T THINK IT WILL LEAD TO

63
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:52,522
DISCOURSE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

64
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:54,690
WE HAVE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY.

65
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,627
WHETHER HE NIXS IT OR FIXES IT.

66
00:01:57,627 --> 00:01:59,495
WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE A

67
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,130
DISCUSSION ABOUT SANCTIONS AND

68
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,765
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN IRAN.

69
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,834
WE HAVE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION --

70
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:05,935
ALL OF THESE UNCOMFORTABLE

71
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:06,836
TOPICS THAT WERE NEVER BROUGHT

72
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,137
UP TO BEGIN WITH.

73
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:09,472
LOOK AT THE COMPARISON HERE

74
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:10,406
BETWEEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

75
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:11,841
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

76
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:12,809
YOU HAVE THE TRUMP

77
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:13,609
ADMINISTRATION, FOR EXAMPLE, IN

78
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:15,311
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

79
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:15,711
NORTH KOREA.

80
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,380
THEY'RE TAKING A LOOK AT REALITY

81
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,783
TO TRY TO COME UP WITH AN

82
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:21,784
OUTCOME.

83
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:22,652
WHAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

84
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:24,053
DID, THEY STARTED WITH AN

85
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:25,588
OUTCOME AND WHAT THEY DID IS

86
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:27,690
MANIPULATE REALITY TO GET TO

87
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,192
THAT OUTCOME TO GET THE DEAL.

88
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,360
IN MANIPULATING THAT REALITY,

89
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,896
THEY SIDE-STEPPED THE FACT THAT

90
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:35,331
IRAN IS IN NUMBER 1 STATE

91
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:37,133
SPONSOR OF TERRORISM, THE FACT

92
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:40,036
THAT THEY HAVE HANDS IN SYRIA

93
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:42,638
AND IN LEBANON AND IN YEMEN --

94
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:43,873
>> Neil: I DON'T THINK THEY

95
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:44,340
IGNORED THAT.

96
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,210
YOU'RE RIGHT TO SAY THAT.

97
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,313
BUT THEY BEGRUDGINGLY SIGNED ON

98
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:53,249
TO IT AND WERE AWARE OF THE

99
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:53,616
PROBLEMS.

100
00:02:53,616 --> 00:02:56,118
BUT DO YOU THINK BY NIXING THIS

101
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:58,254
AND STARTING FROM SCRATCH,

102
00:02:58,254 --> 00:02:59,255
ESPECIALLY WHEN IRAN GOT ALL

103
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:01,290
MONEY THEY WANTED, THAT THEY'LL

104
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,993
BE COMPELLED TO CHANGE?

105
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:05,628
>> NO.

106
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,330
THEY HAVE LEARNED TO WORK AROUND

107
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,931
THE LOOP HOLE OF SANCTIONS AND

108
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:11,067
THE PRESSURE OF THE

109
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,869
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,

110
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:14,003
INCLUDING ISRAEL.

111
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:15,471
NETANYAHU CAN GIVE A GREAT

112
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:18,407
PRESENTATION OF THE FACTS, BUT

113
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,775
WHEN YOU HAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION

114
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:21,143
AND MANY DEMOCRATS PUTTING THE

115
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:23,312
PRESSURE ON TRUMP, IT'S

116
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:25,114
DIFFICULT TO USE THAT LEVERAGE

117
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:27,216
TO GET IRAN TO CHANGE.

118
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:30,052
DOES IRAN WANT TO STAY IN THE

119
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:30,953
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WITH

120
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:32,555
REGARDS TO TRADE, JUST HAVING

121
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:36,492
THAT GOOD NORMALIZED RELATIONS?

122
00:03:36,492 --> 00:03:37,894
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY DO WHEN

123
00:03:37,894 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY'RE STILL FLEXING MUSCLES.
