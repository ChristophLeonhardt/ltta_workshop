REPERCUSSIONS IN THE WORKPLACE

81
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:37,019
BECAUSE THE INCIDENT ONLY LASTED

82
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,620
10-12 MINUTES.

83
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:41,323

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,001
IT APPEARS THAT'S ONLY TRUE FOR

88
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:53,202
DEMOCRATIC WOMEN.

89
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:54,637
MEANWHILE, PROFESSOR FORD IS

90
00:02:54,638 --> 00:03:01,811
FACING ALLEGATIONS OF HER OWN.

91
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:05,214
HER BOYFRIEND BETWEEN 1992 AND

92

95
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:12,421
CONFINED SPACES, WRITING IN

AIRPLANES AND HOMES WITH ONLY

97
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:16,058
ONE DOOR BECAUSE OF PTSD

98
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:17,827
SYMPTOMS SURROUNDING HER ALLEGED

99
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:18,561

BOYFRIEND WHOSE NAME HAS BEEN

102
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,035
REDACTED, FORD NEVER EXPRESSED

103
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:27,303
THESE ISSUES WITH SMALL SPACES.

104
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:29,338
SHE FREQUENTLY FLEW IN AIRPLANES

105
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:30,739

00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:35,611
ASSAULTED.

110
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:37,079
HE ALSO CLAIMED THAT FORD ONCE

111
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,048
COUNSELED A FRIEND ON HOW TO

112
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:40,015
PASS A POLYGRAPH TEST.

113
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:41,350
PRIOR TO A JOB INTERVIEW WITH

114
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,785
THE FBI.

115
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:45,187
THAT'S A CLAIM THAT FRIEND IS

116
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:45,955
DENYING.

117
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:47,423
NOW REMEMBER DURING FORD'S

118
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:49,592

119
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:50,626
TOTAL IN EXTREMES WITH

120
00:03:50,627 --> 00:03:51,427
POLYGRAPHS.

121
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:52,962
NATURALLY ABC AND CBS, THEY

122
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:58,000
TOTALLY IGNORE THE STORY.

123
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:58,901
THAT IS CALLED BY A CIVIL

124
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:02,805
OMISSION, SHOULDN'T SHOCK US.

125
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:05,007
MEANWHILE IN A CASE OF CLAIMED

NONE OF IT.

143
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:33,769
THEY DON'T EVEN CARE WITH THIS

144
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,005
IMPENDING FBI REPORT WILL

145
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:37,173
UNCOVER WERE NOT UNCOVERED.

146
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:38,207
DIANNE FEINSTEIN DOESN'T EVEN

147
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,609
WANT TO SHOW IT TO YOU.

148
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,877
ALMOST ALL DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN

149
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:42,811
AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH OR

150
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:44,647
WHOEVER THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE

151
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:45,414
CHOSEN FROM DAY ONE.

152
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:47,583
YOU ARE ONLY NOW PRETENDING TO

153
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:50,252
CARE ABOUT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST

154
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:51,820
CAVANAUGH BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

155
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:52,588
STILL STALL THE CONFIRMATION

156
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:52,888
VOTE.

157
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,192
TO THEM, SADLY, THIS IS ABOUT

158
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:57,993
POWER AND POLITICAL

159
00:04:57,994 --> 00:04:58,427
GAMESMANSHIP.

160
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,629
WHETHER OR NOT KAVANAUGH IS

161
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,764
GUILTY, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.

162
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:04,800
THE DEMOCRATS ARE IN PURSUIT OF

163
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:06,402
POWER.

164
00:05:06,403 --> 00:05:07,736

RANCOR THAT'S GOING ON, BEYOND

THE ACCUSATIONS, WE DON'T LOSE

SIGHT OF WHAT THIS MORAL MOMENT

172

IS ABOUT IN THIS COUNTRY AND

173
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:25,955
ULTIMATELY ASK OURSELVES THE

ULTIMATELY, NOT WHETHER HE'S

INNOCENT OR GUILTY, THIS IS NOT

00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:40,502
A TRIAL, BUT ULTIMATELY HAVE

181
00:05:40,503 --> 00:05:41,337
ENOUGH QUESTIONS BE RAISED THAT

182
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:45,241
WE SHOULD NOT MOVE ON TO ANOTHER

187
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:53,215
IS THAT NOW THE NEW MODERN

00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:57,419
ENOUGH ACCUSATIONS.

191
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,221
GUILTY OF ALL CHARGES REGARDLESS

192
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:06,395
OF WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS.

193
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:08,330
AND IF WHAT CORY BOOKER SAID IS

194
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:11,900
THE NEW STANDARD, THEN GUESS

195
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:15,537
WHAT SPARTACUS, THAT SHOULD BE

196
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:22,111
BASED ON YOUR OWN STANDARDS.

197
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:26,415
AND EVEN AFTER SHE SAID NO AND

198
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:30,252
PUSH YOU AWAY, BYE-BYE,

199
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:30,619
SPARTACUS.

200
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,421
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE THE

201
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:33,222
U.S. SENATE AND SHAME.

202
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:35,024
THAT'S WHY WE CALL THEM THE

203
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:35,658
PARTY OF SMEARS AND I KEEP

204
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:39,228
BRINGING UP THE IDEA OF SLANDER

205
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:40,963
AND LIES AND CHARACTER

206
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:41,964
ASSASSINATION AND FAMILY

207
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:45,668
BLUDGEONING, ALL FOR POLITICAL

208
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,603
POWER OVER AND SACRIFICING THE

209
00:06:47,604 --> 00:06:48,604
RULE OF LAW.

210
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:50,372
AND JUSTICE.

211
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:53,542
THINGS WE SHOULD ALL HOLD DEEPL

212
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:55,244
DEEPLY.

213
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:56,945
AS WE SPEAK, THEY ARE DOING

214
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:58,814
ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO STALL

215
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,748
AND SCARE SENATOR JEFF SNOWFLAKE

216
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:03,819
AND OTHERS INTO VOTING

217
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,820
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION.

218
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:05,854
MAYBE IT'S ABOUT TEMPERAMENT,

219
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:08,624
NOT ABOUT WHAT THE FBI SAYS.

220
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,393
NOW AS WE PREDICTED, THEIR NEW

221
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:13,395
TALKING POINT IS, THE NEW

222
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:15,764
CURRENT FBI INQUIRY IS BEING

223
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:16,799
RUSHED.

224
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,233
NO REQUEST FROM THE FBI, MORE

225
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:22,037
TIME IS NEEDED -- LET MORE TIME

226
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,038
IS NEEDED AT ALL.

227
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,573
IT'S ALL ABOUT DELAY, THEN IT'S

228
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:28,911
ABOUT TEMPERAMENT, AND THEN WE

229
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:33,082
WILL EXACTLY HOW MUCH HE DRANK.

230
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,883
EVEN THOUGH HE DRINKS BEER AND

231
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:36,018
SOMETIMES STILL DRINKS BEER AND

232
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:38,220
SOMETIMES DRINK TOO MUCH BEER.

233
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:39,088
LISTEN TO THIS.

234
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:41,423
>> I TRUST THE FBI, I HOPE THEY

235
00:07:41,424 --> 00:07:43,025
HAVE THE LATITUDE AND TIME TO

236
00:07:43,026 --> 00:07:44,626
GET THE JOB DONE RIGHT.

237
00:07:44,627 --> 00:07:45,728
>> THE REPUBLICANS HELD UP A

238
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:48,497
SEAT WHEN JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA

239
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:50,466
PASSED AWAY FOR NEARLY A YEAR SO

240
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:51,867
THERE'S NO REASON TO RAM THIS

241
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:52,201
THROUGH.

242
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:54,203
THERE SHOULD BE A FULL

243
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:55,037
INVESTIGATION OF ALL OF THE

244
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:56,438
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

245
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,840
RAISED, AND WHATEVER OTHER

246
00:07:57,841 --> 00:07:59,141
WITNESSES FOLLOW ON AS A RESULT

247
00:07:59,142 --> 00:07:59,942
OF THE DISCUSSION OR THE

248
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:02,444
INTERVIEWS OF THOSE WITNESSES.

249
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:04,780
>> THE SENATE SHOULD ALLOW THE

250
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:05,714
FBI TO PURSUE ALL OF THE

251
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:06,815
EVIDENCE AND NOT TO CAP WHERE

252
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:09,151
THEY MAY GO OR PUT A LEASH ON

253
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:10,252
THE INVESTIGATION.

254
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:12,488
>> THE FBI IS VERY CLOSE TO

255
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:13,422
WRAPPING ITS INVESTIGATION.

256
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:15,057
THEY COULD WRAP AS EARLY AS

257
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:15,457
TODAY.

258
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,825
DOES THAT STRIKE YOU AS

259
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:19,661
SUFFICIENT TIME OR DOES NOT FEEL

260
00:08:19,662 --> 00:08:20,629
RUSHED?

261
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,231
>> THAT WOULD CONCERN ME.

262
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:24,400
>> Hannity: WE WANT MORE TIME.

263
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:27,002
LET'S CHANGE THE TOPIC, LET'S

264
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:28,604
INVESTIGATE THIS OR THAT.

265
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:30,906
LAST-MINUTE INVESTIGATIONS.

266
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:31,907
SO YET IN ANOTHER LAST DITCH

267
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:33,041
EFFORT TO SMEAR JUDGE KAVANAUGH

268
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:35,878
AND DESTROY HIS FAMILY, SENATE

269
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,545
DEMOCRATS ARE DEMANDING THE

270
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:38,147
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

271
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:39,047
RETRACT THE FOLLOWING TWEET

272
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:40,883
"NOWHERE IN ANY OF THE SIX FBI

REVIEWED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS

275
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:47,423
WAS THERE EVER A WHIFF OF ANY

276
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,792
ISSUE AT ALL RELATED IN ANY WAY

277
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:52,828
TO INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OR

ALCOHOL ABUSE.

279
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,030
SENATE DEMOCRATS REVEALED ZERO

280
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:58,801
EVIDENCE OVER WHY THAT TWEET

281
00:08:58,802 --> 00:08:59,835
SHOULD BE REDACTED.

282
00:08:59,836 --> 00:09:00,436
IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY

283
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:01,804
COMMITTEE FIRED BACK "NOTHING IN

THE TWEET IS INACCURATE OR

285

MISLEADING.

286
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:05,974
THE COMMITTEE STANDS BITE

287
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:06,675
STATEMENT WHICH IS COMPLETELY

288
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:09,211
TRUTHFUL."

MORE BASELESS INNUENDO AND MORE

DEMOCRATS.

292
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,616
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE DEMOCRATIC

293
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:16,218
PARTY IS THE SMEAR MACHINE, NOW

294
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:18,420
IN FULL GEAR AND FULL PANIC.

295
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:20,389
THEY DON'T WANT THIS VOTE.

296
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,057
IT'S REALLY DESPICABLE TO WATCH.

297
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:23,425
THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR

298
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:25,427
YOUR KIDS AND YOUR GRANDKIDS AND

299
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:29,031
THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY.

300
00:09:29,032 --> 00:09:29,598
GUILT BY ACCUSATION.

301
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,000
ENOUGH ACCUSATIONS, YOU ARE

302
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:32,501
DONE.

303
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:38,774
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE FLAILING.

304
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:39,308
LET'S TALK ABOUT HIS

305
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,610
TEMPERAMENT.

306
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:43,011
HOW IS SOMEONE ACCUSED?

307
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:44,580
THINK ABOUT THIS.

308
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:45,113
YOU ARE ACCUSED OF

309
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:47,749
SYSTEMATICALLY REGULARLY

310
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,489
DRUGGING YOUNG TEENAGE GIRLS

311
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,193
BEING INVOLVED FREQUENT GANG

312
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:00,629
RAPE OF TEENAGE GIRLS, WHAT IS

313
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,630
THE PROPER REACTION?

314
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:02,865
WHAT SHOULD THAT TEMPERAMENT BE

315
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:04,533
OF SOMEBODY IF YOU ARE FALSELY

316
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:04,867
ACCUSED?

317
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:08,036
WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT THEM TO

318
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:10,005
SAY, VERY QUIETLY, I'M INNOCENT?

319
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:11,740
OR DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD HAVE

320
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:15,410
SUCH RIGHTEOUS INKED

321
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:16,378
INDIGNATION, ANGER AND OUTRAGE

322
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:17,279
THAT THEY WANTED TO MAKE IT AS

323
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,649
CLEAR AS POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE

324
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,617
INNOCENT?

325
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:23,085
I THINK THE LETTER IS HOW MOST

326
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:25,854
PEOPLE WOULD ACT AND THE FAR

327
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:27,990

00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:29,324
FACES.

THIS IS EXTRAORDINARILY

338
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:46,241
DANGEROUS.

339
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:48,076
OVER THE WEEKEND, WE SAW

IT WILL BE MORE AND MORE
