1
00:00:01,288 --> 00:00:03,524
RELEASED AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:03,924
THAT RECORD.

3
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:06,394
VERY PROUD AND WE HAVE OTHERS

4
00:00:06,394 --> 00:00:06,794
COMING.

5
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:08,229
TRISH: JOINING ME RIGHT NOW

6
00:00:08,229 --> 00:00:10,164
GORDON CHANG THE AUTHOR OF

7
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:11,298
NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN AND THE COMING

8
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:12,933
COLLAPSE OF CHINA BOY A LOT TO

9
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:14,268
TALK ABOUT HERE TODAY BUT LET ME

10
00:00:14,268 --> 00:00:15,669
START ACTUALLY WITH VENEZUELA

11
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:17,238
AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JOSH

12
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:18,139
HOLT BEING BACK HOME IN AMERICA

13
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:19,673
RIGHT NOW AND WHAT DOES THAT

14
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:20,074
TELL YOU.

15
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:21,575
>>  WELL THIS IS THE SECOND TIME

16
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:22,610
THIS MONTH THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

17
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,980
HAS SECURED THE RELEASE OF

18
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,815
AMERICANS AND I DON'T THINK

19
00:00:27,815 --> 00:00:29,450
THAT'S A COINCIDENCE I THINK THE

20
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,585
BAD ACTORS TOOK ONE LOOK AT THIS

21
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:33,120
PRESIDENT AND SAID HE'S REALLY

22
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,355
REGAINED HIS FOOTING AND NOW IS

23
00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:35,456
NOT THE TIME TO MESS WITH THE

24
00:00:35,456 --> 00:00:36,323
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

25
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:37,958
TRISH: SO THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

26
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,427
EVERYTHING HE DOING RIGHT NOW

27
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:40,828
MAY BE IN FACT A LITTLE BIT

28
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:42,163
CALCULATED FOR THAT WORLD STAGE,

29
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:43,697
GIVEN THAT WE'VE GOT THESE

30
00:00:43,697 --> 00:00:44,799
NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON WITH NORTH

31
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,133
KOREA DO YOU THINK THE SUMMIT IS

32
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:46,767
GOING TO HAPPEN?

33
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:49,303
>>  I THINK SO.

34
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:50,004
THE NORTH KOREANS NEED THIS

35
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:50,805
SUMMIT THEY NEED SANCTIONS

36
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:51,839
RELIEF, THEY CERTAINLY DON'T

37
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:53,908
WANT THE UNITED STATES TO TAKE

38
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:55,176
OUT THEIR NIKE AND THEIR MISSILE

39
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:57,611
FACILITIES AND KIM WANTS

40
00:00:57,611 --> 00:00:58,345
LEGITIMATE ANY STATION OF COURSE

41
00:00:58,345 --> 00:00:59,480
MEETING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND ALSO

42
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,549
HE NEEDS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE

43
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:01,882
CHINESE.

44
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:03,317
THE UNITED STATES HAS NO

45
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:05,653
TERRITORIAL DESIGNS ON THE

46
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:07,087
KOREAN PENINSULA AND THE CHINESE

47
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:09,056
HAD A REALLY ROUGH RELATIONSHIP

48
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:11,091
WITH THE KOREANS SO I THINK KIM

49
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:12,626
REALLY WANTS TO MEET TRUMP AND

50
00:01:12,626 --> 00:01:14,161
WE SAW THAT ON THURSDAY, WHEN

51
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:15,596
YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT CANCELS

52
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:17,731
THE SUMMIT AND WITHIN HOURS, THE

53
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:19,400
NORTH KOREANS COME OUT WITH THIS

54
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,635
STRING OF USUALLY CONCEALED

55
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:23,404
MESSAGES AND SAYING WE EVEN WILL

56
00:01:23,404 --> 00:01:26,140
GO FOR THE TRUMP FORMULA ON

57
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,640
DENUCLEARIZATION.

58
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,210
THIS IS REALLY QUITE STUNNING.

59
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,444
TRISH: SO WHY DID THEY PULL WHAT

60
00:01:30,444 --> 00:01:32,279
THEY DID AND HAVE SO MANY

61
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:33,180
AGGRESSIVE STATEMENTS IN THE

62
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,515
DAYS BEFORE THAT LED US TO HAVE

63
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:36,050
TO SAY OKAY GUYS, ENOUGH.

64
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,985
>>  WELL I THINK A NUMBER OF

65
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:38,853
FACTORS BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT

66
00:01:38,853 --> 00:01:40,421
ONE IS THAT THE CHINESE WERE

67
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:43,257
REALLY STARTING TO SAY TO THE

68
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:44,692
KOREANS ESPECIALLY AFTER THAT

69
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:45,926
SECOND SUMMIT WHERE KIM WENT TO

70
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:48,095
CHINA TWO TIMES IN A ROW I THINK

71
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:49,897
THE CHINESE BASICALLY SAID LOOK

72
00:01:49,897 --> 00:01:50,798
PULLBACK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL

73
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:52,433
WITH THE AMERICANS BECAUSE WE

74
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:53,567
CHIN EASE ARE GOING TO SUPPORT

75
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:54,869
YOUR ECONOMY AND WE SAW IN THE

76
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,604
FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THIS MONTH,

77
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:58,339
THE PRICE OF GAS AND DIESEL IN

78
00:01:58,339 --> 00:02:00,107
THE NORTHERN PART OF NORTH KOREA

79
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:01,375
FELL DRAMATICALLY AND THE ONLY

80
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,510
REASON THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED

81
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,844
IS BECAUSE THE CHINESE ARE

82
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:05,145
PUMPING MUCH MORE OIL THROUGH

83
00:02:05,145 --> 00:02:06,480
THE FRIENDSHIP PIPELINE.

84
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,082
TRISH: I ALSO HEARD THAT COAL

85
00:02:08,082 --> 00:02:09,483
MAY ACTUALLY, THE COAL TRADE MAY

86
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:10,951
HAVE BEEN RESUMED AS WELL WHERE

87
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:12,386
THE NORTH KOREANS ARE ABLE TO

88
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:14,722
SEND THE CHINESE COAL SO IN THAT

89
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:16,490
CASE THEY'RE IN VIOLATIONS OF

90
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,192
THE SANCTIONS.

91
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:19,960
>>  FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS NOW,

92
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,495
MAYBE TWO AND A HALF, THERE'S

93
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:23,764
BEEN REALLY BLATANT CHINESE

94
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:25,533
SANCTIONS BUSTING AND IT'S A

95
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,902
NUMBER OF THINGS, NORTH KOREAN

96
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:30,037
WORKERS ARE NOW BACK IN CHINA,

97
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:30,771
CHINESE INVESTMENT INTO NORTH

98
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:34,842
KOREA, THERE'S ALL THOSE GIFTS

99
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:36,810
THAT THEY GAVE TO KIM AT THE END

100
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,245
OF MARCH AT THEIR SUMMIT THAT'S

101
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,680
A VIOLATION OF U.N. SANCTIONS

102
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,814
AND THE WORST THING ABOUT THIS,

103
00:02:40,814 --> 00:02:42,349
TRISH IS NOT ONLY THAT THE

104
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:43,884
CHINESE VIOLATED THE SANCTIONS

105
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:45,753
BY GIVING ALL THOSE LUXURY ITEMS

106
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:48,789
THEY PHOTOGRAPHED IT AND WERE

107
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:50,224
SAYING LOOK WE'RE VIOLATING

108
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:51,225
SANCTIONS U.S. WHAT YOU GOING TO

109
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:52,126
DO ABOUT IT?

110
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:53,360
TRISH: WELL WE CAN DO SOMETHING

111
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,396
BELIEVE ME WE CAN DO A WHOLE LOT

112
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:56,297
ABOUT IT.

113
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:58,165
YOU KNOW, AND DON'T FORGET AND I

114
00:02:58,165 --> 00:02:59,600
KNOW YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A

115
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,501
LOT AND I APPRECIATE THIS

116
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:02,169
BECAUSE YOU AND I ARE TOGETHER

117
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:03,337
ON THIS ONE.

118
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:04,872
WE HAVE ECONOMIC LEVERAGE SO

119
00:03:04,872 --> 00:03:09,977
BEFORE WE START SENDING TROOPS

120
00:03:09,977 --> 00:03:11,579
WE OUGHT TO BE DOING EVERYTHING

121
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:12,613
ECONOMICALLY WE POSSIBLY CAN

122
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:14,448
WITH CHINA TO INFLUENCE WHAT

123
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:17,818
THEY'RE DOING WITH NORTH KOREA

124
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:19,653
AND BY THAT I MEAN --

125
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:22,089
>>  WE HOLD ALL HIGH CARDS FOR

126
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:23,324
INSTANCE WE CAN FOR INSTANCE

127
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:24,325
DECLARE FOUR OF THE BIGGEST

128
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:25,893
CHINESE BANKS TO BE PRIMARY

129
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:27,194
MONEY LAUNDERING CONCERNS USED

130
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:28,529
TO BE JUST BANK OF CHINA.

131
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:29,830
NOW THERE'S EVIDENCE COMING OUT

132
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,165
THAT THE THREE OTHERS OF THE BIG

133
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:32,433
FOUR HAVE ALSO BEEN HANDLING

134
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:35,235
NORTH KOREA'S MONEY.

135
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:36,337
TRISH: LIKE IT'S IN OPERATION

136
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:37,705
RIGHT DOWN THERE.

137
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:38,839
IT'S CLOSED TODAY BECAUSE IT'S

138
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:39,974
SUNDAY BUT IT'S IN OPERATION

139
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:41,642
OVER THERE ON MADISON.

140
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:43,143
>>  IT'S EIGHT BLOCKS FROM HERE

141
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:45,179
SO WE CAN DO THAT.

142
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:47,448
WE ALSO GOT ZTE THAT CHINESE

143
00:03:47,448 --> 00:03:49,183
EMBATTLED TELECOM MANUFACTURE

144
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:50,517
ITS GOT A DEATH SENTENCE RIGHT

145
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:53,621
NOW FROM THE TRUMP ADMINITRATION

146
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,656
AND THE CHINESE NEED RELIEF FROM

147
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:55,956
THAT.

148
00:03:55,956 --> 00:03:57,091
TRISH: BUT WE'RE LETTING IT

149
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:58,292
EXIST GORDON.

150
00:03:58,292 --> 00:03:59,760
I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED BECAUSE

151
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,528
IT FEELS LIKE A MIXED SIGNAL.

152
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:02,730
>>  I WOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE

153
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,531
PEOPLE ARE SAYING WELL LOOK THE

154
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:06,900
ZTE DEAL THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

155
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,035
NEGOTIATED IS A GOOD ONE BUT THE

156
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:10,037
POINT IS THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE OF

157
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:11,739
WHETHER IT'S A GOOD DEAL OR NOT

158
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:12,473
R US OR THEM.

159
00:04:12,473 --> 00:04:15,142
THE CHINESE IS THE CHINESE MADE

160
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:16,677
THIS AN ISSUE OF POLITICAL WILL

161
00:04:16,677 --> 00:04:17,911
SAYING YOU HAVE TO GIVE RELIEF

162
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:20,346
TO ZTE SO ANY DEAL NO DEAL NO

163
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:21,915
MATTER HOW GOOD IS A GOOD DEAL.

164
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:23,450
WE NEED TO SHOW CHAIN THAT WE

165
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,418
HAVE POLITICAL WILL AND THAT WE

166
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:26,020
WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO MESS WITH

167
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,955
IRAN SANCTIONS, NORTH KOREA

168
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:29,790
SANCTIONS YOU NAME IT.

169
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,159
TRISH: OKAY SO MAYBE NOT TRADE

170
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,826
SO MUCH.

171
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:34,094
>>  NOT TRADE SO MUCH.

172
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:35,095
TRISH: I MEAN THE WHOLE TRADE

173
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:37,231
THING IS A WHOLE OTHER

174
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:38,332
CONVERSATION BECAUSE THE IDEA

175
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:43,203
THEY'RE LIKE OKAY, WE'RE GOING

176
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:44,405
15% ON CARS.

177
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:46,373
>>  THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.

178
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:47,641
THAT TARIFF HAS TO GO DOWN TO

179
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:49,877
WHAT OUR TARIFF IS ON CHINESE

180
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:50,911
CARS.

181
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:51,912
TRISH: 2.5%.

182
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:54,081
OR HOW ABOUT 0 FOR EVERYONE?

183
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:55,249
>>  0 FOR EVERYONE.

184
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:56,417
TRISH: GORDON IT'S GOOD TO SEE

185
00:04:56,417 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU THANK YOU.
