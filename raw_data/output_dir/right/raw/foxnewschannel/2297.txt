>> I NEVER HAD A BETTER EXCUSE

8

TO SKIP THE CORRESPONDENTS

9
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:35,911
DINNER.

10
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:41,416
>> WE'LL GET TO THAT.

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,218
STEVE: A LOT HAPPENED THIS WEEK.

12
00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:44,953
LET'S START WITH THE SERIOUS

13
00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:46,655
STUFF.  THE FOREIGN POLICY

14
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:46,988
ASPECTS.

15
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:50,492
THERE ARE THINGS WE SAW THIS

16
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:52,794
WEEK CREE

17
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:52,827
WEEK KREE

18
00:00:52,827 --> 00:00:55,030
WEEK KOREA HAS BEEN WIDELY

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,730
COMMENTED ON.

20
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,166
ALSO THE WAY HE MADE PROGRESS ON

21
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:04,506
THE IRAN ISSUE WITH WHEN JUST A

22
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:06,508
FEW WEEKS AGO THEY WERE SAYING

23
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:07,642
HANG ON A SECOND.

24
00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:09,444
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S

25
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,545
TALKING ABOUT.

26
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:13,081
THEY ARE COMING AROUND TO HIS

27
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:13,448
POSITION.

28
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,817
THEY CAN'T GIVE HIM CREDIT, CAN

29
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:18,586
THEY.

30
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:20,255
>> NO, I DON'T THINK THEY WILL

31
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:22,824
GIVE HIM CREDIT.

32
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:25,560
IT'S NOT THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,297
FELLOW HUMANS BUT THE NOBEL

34
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,499
PRIZE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE TO

35
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:32,767
GIVE HIM A PRIZE.

36
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:37,372
IT'S AMAZING.

37
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:40,542
WE TALK ABOUT DOMESTICALLY WHAT

38
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:42,877
DONALD TRUMP HAS MEANT.

39
00:01:42,877 --> 00:01:46,081
AROUND THE WORLD, DOING THINGS

40
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:46,481
DIFFERENTLY.

41
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,651
MAYBE IN SOME CASES DOING THING

42
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:54,689
WORSE THEN THE WAY ESTABLISHMENT

43
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:55,857
WAS DOING.

44
00:01:55,857 --> 00:01:58,426
IT'S A BREATHE OF FRESH AIR.

45
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:01,329
WE HAD DECADES OF FAILURE BUT

46
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,064
DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS THE

47
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:04,933
FIRST STEP TO FINDING THE RIGHT

48
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:05,633
SOLUTION.

49
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,302
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS

50
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:09,437
HE SAID.

51
00:02:09,437 --> 00:02:11,740
I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE USUAL

52
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,775
KIND OF THING PEOPLE GOT USED

53
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:14,109
TO.

54
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:16,077
HE WILL SHAKE THINGS UP AND

55
00:02:16,077 --> 00:02:16,945
DOING HIS WAY.

56
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:19,814
ALL OF THE EXPERTS SAID IT WOULD

57
00:02:19,814 --> 00:02:21,583
BE A DISASTER.

58
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,485
WRECK THE WORLD AND IT WILL BE A

59
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:24,619
DANGER TO US.

60
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:31,326
IT'S NOT TURNING OUT LIKE THAT.

61
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:36,064
>> HIS PRECEPTIAL IS P.R.

62
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:37,899
PRESIDENT TRUMP HASN'T CHANGED

63
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:39,167
WHO HE IS.

64
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,069
THE BIGGER THING IS PEOPLE DON'T

65
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,737
EXPECT YOU TO BE THE SAME PERSON

66
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:44,272
AND THINK YOU WILL DO IT.

67
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:45,673
PEOPLE SAID HE WILL CHANGE WHEN

68
00:02:45,673 --> 00:02:46,808
HE GETS IN.

69
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:48,143
HE WILL BE PRESIDENTIAL.

70
00:02:48,143 --> 00:02:50,211
WHEN YOU GET MARRIED IT'S NOT

71
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,946
ABOUT ONCE WE GET MARRIED IT

72
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:53,248
WILL BE DIFFERENT.

73
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:54,616
HE IS WHO HE IS.

74
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:56,051
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT.

75
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,421
THEY TALKED ABOUT AT THE WHITE

76
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:01,456
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT DINNER THIS

77
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:03,591
IS WHO YOU WANTED AND PUT IN

78
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:03,925
OFFICE.

79
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:06,428
HE'S BEING CONSISTENT WITH THAT.

80
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:08,396
I'LL ALSO SAY I'M SURE HE'S

81
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,999
LISTENED TO SOME COUNCIL AROUND

82
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:11,266
HIM.

83
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,701
HIM NOT DOING FOREIGN POLICY

84
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:14,035
BEFORE.

85
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:19,374
WE CAN'T ASSUME HASN'T TAPPED

86
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:21,042
INTO HIS RESOURCES.

87
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:23,178
WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD OR

88
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:24,779
WHATEVER IT IS PEOPLE WILL

89
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:26,214
REMAIN CRITICAL BECAUSE HE

90
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:27,682
CONTINUES TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE

91
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:29,784
BOX AND NOT DO WHAT WE ARE USED

92
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:31,486
TO SEE A PRESIDENT DO.

93
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:33,655
>> WHAT DOE YOU MAKE OF THE

94
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:36,157
KANYE WEST THING, AGAIN WIDELY

95
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:37,092
DISCUSSED THIS WEEK.

96
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,661
WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME WHEN

97
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:42,297
YOU SAW THE BACKLASH FROM THE

98
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:46,568
LEFT HE WASN'T REALLY BLACK

99
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:48,636
ANYMORE, HE WAS RICH.

100
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:50,705
IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THE WAY

101
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:52,373
THE RESPONSE CAME IN.

102
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:54,142
>> THERE ARE TWO PROSPECTIVES.

103
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:59,347
ONE I'M A POET AND HIP-HOP HEAD.

104
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:02,717
I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR ALL

105
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:03,451
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

106
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,354
YOU MADE A INTERESTING POINT

107
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:08,389
ABOUT BEING RICH.

108
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:10,692
HIP-HOP HAS A PROBLEM WITH

109
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:11,793
PEOPLE BEING RICH.

110
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,761
MOST OF YOU ARE MORE REPUBLICAN

111
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:14,529
THEN YOU THINK.

112
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:16,531
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT GETTING

113
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:19,367
IRISH OR

114
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:19,399
RIISH OR

115
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:19,633
RICHH OR

116
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:19,666
RICH OOR

117
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,434
RICH ORR

118
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:21,668
RICH OR ALREADY RICH.

119
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,404
KANYE CAME FROM A POET AND

120
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:25,340
TURNED INTO A RAPPER AND SPOKE

121
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,574
ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS.

122
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:32,013
ONCE YOU ARE DEEMED AS BAD FOR

123
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:35,550
THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.

124
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,086
I GET CRITICIZED FOR COMING ON

125
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:38,353
FOX.

126
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:39,854
IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE FOX

127
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:42,757
HAS BEEN DEEMED EVERYTHING

128
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:47,495
THAT'S HELPFUL MORE ME AND MY

129
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:47,829
PEOPLE.

130
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,731
FOR KANYE TO STEP OUTSIDE OF

131
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:52,133
THAT AND SAY I WANT DO BE A FREE

132
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:52,467
SPEAKER.

133
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:54,269
I TELL PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME

134
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:56,504
SOMEONE HAS TO GO TO FOX.

135
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,907
SOMEONE HAS TO HAVE THE

136
00:04:58,907 --> 00:04:59,340
CONVERSATION.

137
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,242
BECAUSE HE CAME OUT AND DID

138
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:02,744
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SAID

139
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:04,846
LET'S HAVE THE CONVERSATION IS

140
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:10,952
WHAT HIP-HOP AND

141
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:11,452
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

142
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:12,787
HIP-HOP STARTED ABOUT TALKING

143
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:16,191
ABOUT THE STRUGGLE.

144
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,393
FOR HIM TO TALK ABOUT CAPITALISM

145
00:05:18,393 --> 00:05:20,828
AND FREE CAPITAL AND TALKING

146
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:22,463
ABOUT SECOND AMENDMENT AND ALL

147
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:28,970
OF THE THING HIP-HOP PREACHES ON

148
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,438
A DAILY BASES.

149
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:34,475
IF YOU TALK ABOUT TRUMP WHO IS

150
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:36,010
ABOUT BUSINESS OWNERS.

151
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,513
ROLLING IT OUT THAT WAY AS

152
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:41,716
OPPOSED TO I'M WEARING A HAT AND

153
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,319
MAKING IT A GIMMICK IS THE

154
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,022
PROBLEM WITH WHY IT WON'T BE

155
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:48,389
PRESERVED.

156
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,090
STEVE: THAT'S A GREAT POINT.

157
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,458
WE HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE

158
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,460
AGENDA HE RAN ON AND WHETHER OR

159
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,062
NOT HE'S DOING IT.

160
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,930
IT'S INTERESTING WHAT HE WAS

161
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,564
SAYING THERE.

162
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,834
HE PICKED UP ON WHAT KASICH IS

163
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:00,668
SAYING.

164
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:02,870
THIS POLARIZATION AND ANGER.

165
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,505
HE'S REACHING OUT AND TRYING TO

166
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:07,508
GET OUT OF THE BOXES AND HAVE A

167
00:06:07,508 --> 00:06:08,009
CONVERSATION.

168
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,110
>> THAT WAS THE STRANGE THING

169
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,778
ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN.

170
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:12,814
IF YOU HEAD THE MEDIA IT'S THE

171
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:15,049
MOST POLARIZING CAMPAIGN.

172
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:17,785
THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON.

173
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:19,921
TWO THINGS DONALD TRUMP'S

174
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,390
CAMPAIGN WAS THE MOST ISSUE

175
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,360
ORIENTED CAMPAIGN I EVER

176
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,693
COVERED.

177
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:27,462
THAT GOES BACK A FEW YEARS.

178
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:29,097
SECOND THING IS THE ISSUES AS

179
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:34,235
YOU POINTED OUT WERE UNIFYING

180
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:36,437
ISSUES.

181
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,240
THEY SPOKE ABOUT BREAKING DOWN

182
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,409
THE BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS AND

183
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,310
THINGS LIKE THAT.

184
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,212
ALL OF THAT, IT DOESN'T MATTER

185
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:46,547
WHAT COLOR YOU ARE THESE ARE

186
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:47,782
POPULAR MESSAGES.

187
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,717
THE FINAL MESSAGE, YOU KNOW, ALL

188
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:52,253
OF THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN

189
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:54,656
GOOD TO ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES

190
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:57,058
IT'S CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN GOOD

191
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:57,525
