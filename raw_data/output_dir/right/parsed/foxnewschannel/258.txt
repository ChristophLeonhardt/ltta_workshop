INVOLVEMENT.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY NEXT GUEST IS A LONG TIME
ACQUAINTANCE OF THE MISSING
JOURNALIST.
JUDITH, YOU WROTE ABOUT THE
STORY OVER THE WEEKEND, AND YOU
WERE CONVINCED OF THAN THAT HE
HAD BEEN MURDERED, AND THAT IT
HAD BEEN DONE BY SAUDIS?
>> RIGHT.
I THINK IT WAS OBVIOUS TO THOSE
OF US WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE
MIDDLE EAST, WHO HAVE WATCHED
THE MIDDLE EAST FOR A LONG TIME
AND HAVE BEEN WATCHING
SAUDI ARABIA, THAT WHEN A MAN
SAYS TO HIS FIANCEE, HERE'S MY
CELL PHONE, I'M GOING INTO AN
EMBASSY, I CONSULATE THAT MAY BE
PROBLEMATIC FOR ME.
IF I DON'T COME OUT, CALL THE
PRESIDENT OF TURKEY'S OFFICE,
BECAUSE SOMETHING BAD HAD
HAPPENED.
I HAD A VERY BAD FEELING AND
FIGURED THAT'S WHAT HAD
HAPPENED.
>> Martha: SO THE CROWN PRINCE
OF SAUDI ARABIA HAS BEEN
BRIDGING THESE RELATIONSHIPS AND
SAYING HE HAS A REFORMIST OF
SAUDI ARABIA AND HE HAS ALLOWED
WOMEN TO DRIVE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN
HERALDING HOW WONDERFUL IT IS
THAT WE ARE'S BUILDING A NICE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISRAEL AND
SAUDI ARABIA.
HE PUTS ALL THIS AT RISK FOR
THIS JOURNALIST?
>> I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE
DONE THIS UNLESS HE HAD REASON
TO BELIEVE THAT NOTHING TERRIBLE
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM, AND
THERE WERE LOTS OF INDICATIONS
THAT THAT WAS TRUE.
IN FACT, PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY
CALLED THE U.S. AND SAUDI
RELATIONS EXCELLENT AND IT'S
CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO
SAID THAT HE WANTED TO CONTINUE
SELLING WEAPONS TO SAUDI ARABIA.
BY THE WAY, THE PRESIDENT SAID,
SAUDI ARABIA WAS HIS FIRST
FOREIGN TRIP.
HE SAID THAT HE AND IT DEALS TO
BUY $110 BILLION WORTH OF
WEAPONS BUT THE BOOKING
INSTITUTIONS POINT OUT THAT
THERE HAD BEEN ZERO BIG
PURCHASES, SAUDI PURCHASES SO
FAR.
SO THIS IS REALLY AN EXCUSE.
I THINK WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
THE CROWN PRINCE HEAVEN, AND HIS
HATRED OF IRAN AND A DESIRE TO
KEEP OIL PRICES VERY LOW.
GOOD SAUDI U.S. RELATIONS, THEY
ARE LONG-STANDING.
EVERY AMERICAN PRESIDENT WANTS
GOOD RELATIONS BUT THIS TIME
THIS BRASH YOUNG LEADER WHO HAS
MADE MANY MISTAKES IN FOREIGN
POLICY HAS JUST GONE TOO FAR.
>> AND WE REMEMBER WHEN HE
LOCKED UP A LOT OF THE TOP
FAMILY MEMBERS AND OFFICIALS AT
THE RITZ-CARLTON, I BELIEVE IT
WAS, AND HELD THEM, AND THEN
ESCORTED THEM ESSENTIALLY TO
BASICALLY PAY THEIR WAY OUT OF
OF AIR.
BUT HE SAID HE WAS CLEANING OUT
THE GOVERNMENT, GETTING RID OF
PEOPLE WHO WERE CORRUPT IN THAT
LEADERSHIP.
>> A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE
PRESS WERE SAYING, ISN'T THIS
WONDERFUL?
HE'S TAKING DOWN THE ELITE, HE'S
TAKING ILL-GOTTEN GAINS FROM
WEALTHY SAUDIS, AND HE LOCKED TO
THESE PEOPLE UP IN A FIVE-STAR
PRISON WITHOUT FORMAL CHARGES,
WITHOUT ANY JUDGE LOOKING AT
ANYTHING.
THIS WAS NOT THE SIGN OF US IN A
THIS WAS NOT THE SIGN OF US IN N
ISLAMIC REFORMER.
THIS WAS NOT THE MAN WHO
BELIEVED SAUDI ARABIA NEED
SECULARIZATION AND RULE OF LAW.
>> THE BOB CORKER AND
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS ON
THE SHOW LAST NIGHT AND SAYING,
THEY MEAN BUSINESS.
DO THEY THINK -- I REALLY
THINK -- THERE WAS AN
ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY THAT
SAUDI ARABIA AND TURKEY WERE
GOING TO WORK TOGETHER.
IT'S A JOINT INVESTIGATION AND
THAT'S LIKE FOX'S GUARD THE HEN
HOUSE IF THE UNITED STATES JOINS
SUCH AN INVESTIGATION.
IT'S LIKELY TO BE A WHITEWASH.
I THINK WE PRETTY MUCH KNOW WHAT
HAPPENS, AND I DON'T THINK THAT
SAUDI ARABIA IN THE END WILL PAY
MUCH OF A PRICE FOR THIS.
THE CARAVAN WILL MOVE ON.
AS WE SAY IN THE MIDDLE EAST,
THE TENSION WILL BE DISTRACTED
BY KANYE, BY THE HURRICANES,
WHATEVER.
DONALD TRUMP THINKS THAT WE NEED
TO SAUDI ARABIA, AND I WILL
LAUGH, I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE
WILL EVER BE JUSTICE FOR JAMAAL.
