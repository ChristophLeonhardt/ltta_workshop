UNDERMINE OUR PRESIDENT AND THE
CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT.
>> ALL RIGHT.
MEANWHILE THE DEBATE OVER
CHILDREN BEING SEPARATED FROM
THEIR PARENTS AT THE BORDER HAS
REACHED A FEVER PITCH.
FLORIDA IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
SPOTLIGHT BECAUSE THE SECOND
SPLIT FROM PARENTS IS HERE.
>> WE WANT TO SEE THESE CHILDREN
GET BACK WITH THEIR PARENTS.
>> IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES IN
FLORIDA HAVE BEEN BUSY LONG
BEFORE THE FAMILY SEPARATION
ISSUE BOILED OVER.
THERE ARE 760,000 UNAUTHORIZED
IMMIGRANTS IN FLORIDA.
3rd MOST IN AMERICA.
>> WE CAN’T ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO
UNDER GO THE SAME DANGEROUS
JOURNEY.
>> ICE ARRESTS IN FLORIDA ARE UP
76 PRESIDENT OUTPACING THE 30%
BORDERS IS A PRIMARY THING WE
ARE ALL FOCUSSED ON.
OUR MILITARY IS OVERSEAS
FIGHTING THAT FRONT FOR US.
WE HAVE TO DO IT HERE.
>> VISITORS WHO OVERSTAY THEIR
PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION
NON-LATINO POPULATION.
>> MOST OF THE TALK ABOUT THE
BORDER IS FOCUSSED ON
CALIFORNIA, ARIZONA AND TEXAS
IT, BUT FLORIDA HAS MORE THAN
ARE APPREHENDED HERE EVERY YEAR.
YOU CAN’T KEEP THEM OUT WITH
HOUSEED IN 3 DETENTION
FACILITIES IN THE STATE OF
FLORIDA.
SHOULD THESE SEPARATIONS EVER
HAVE BEEN USED BY THE
ADMINISTRATION AS A DETERRENT TO
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION OR WAS THAT
A MISTAKE?
>> THE FOLKS THAT COME ILLEGALLY
OWN COUNTRY.
TO VOTE AGAINST ALLOWING
MILITARY ON OUR BORDER TO SECURE
IT.
AS COMMISSIONER HE ENDORSED THE
GANG OF 8, IMMIGRATION AMNESTY
TO DO E-VERIFY TO SHUT OFF THE
JOBS SPIGOT, IT WOULD BE GOOD
FOR TAXPAYERS, HE TWISTED ARMS
IN THE STATE SENATE AND HELPED
KILL IT BEHIND THE SEQUENCE.
-- SCENES.
HE DIDN’T PUT FLORIDA THERE.
HE PUT BIG DONORS AHEAD OF THE
TO GIVE YOU THE FULL-TIME TO
RESPOND.
>> THAT’S RICH FOR SOMEONE WHO
VOTED TO GIVE FOOD STAMPS TO
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
>> THAT’S NOT TRUE.
YOU KNOW THAT!
COME ON!
>> HERE’S THE DEAL.
>> .
>> LET’S TALK ABOUT FLORIDA.
OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS NEED TO BE
SECURE OUR BORDERS.
A PERMANENT RESOLUTION TO THE
DACA CHILDREN.
WASHINGTON AS RECENTLY AS THIS
WEEK, WASHINGTON YET AGAIN LET
US DOWN AND LET THE PRESIDENT
DOWN BY NOT PASSING A FIX TO
IMMIGRATION.
HERE IN FLORIDA, OUR 21 MILLION
FLORIDIANS ARE PLAYING
CLOTHE AND HOUSE CRIMINAL
ILLEGAL ALIENS IN OUR PRISON
THAT HAS END.
IT WILL END AS PART OF MY SECURE
FLORIDA FIRST AGENDA.
THE SHERIFF YOU SAW IN THE CLIP
ENDORSED ME.
YOUR SHERIFF ENDORSED ME AND I.
EXCITED ABOUT 45 SHERIFFS WHO
HAVE ENDORSED ME.
THEY KNOW BOTH OF OUR RECORDS
AND THEY KNOW WHO IS BEST FOR
SECURING OUR BORDERS AND KEEPING
FLORIDIANS SAFE.
>> HE DIDN’T REFUTE ANYTHING
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRUE.
IF I AM GOVERNOR I WILL WORK
HARD AND WILL SIGN E-VERIFY INTO
LAW IN FLORIDA.
HE WON’T DO THAT.
BECAUSE HIS BIG DONORS WANT THAT
CHEAP FOREIGN LABOR.
THAT LOWERS WAGES FOR
FLORIDIANS.
IT’S BAD FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND
NOT GOOD FOR TAXPAYERS.
FOR HIM TO SAY I SUPPORTED BEN
GETS FOR ILLEGALS.
THAT’S DEAD WRONG.
I VOTED AGAINST A FARM BILL THAT
HAD OBAMA’S FOOD STAMP PROGRAM
CODIFIED.
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE BILL.
I WAS RIGHT TO VOTE NO.
WHAT HE IS SAYING IS NOT TRUE.
HE IS WEAK ON THE BORDER.
HE HAS BEEN WEAK ON ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS AND SUPPORTED THE
GANG OF 8 AMNESTY WHICH IS
A TERRIBLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION.
>> COMMISSIONER, YOU ENDORSED
THE FORMER FLORIDA GOVERNOR JEB
BUSH IN 2016.
MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT OF THE
REASON HE LOST WAS BECAUSE OF
THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE.
DO YOU THINK HE WAS RIGHT.
>> LOOK, HE WAS MY FRIEND AND
OUR
-- HE WAS MY FRIEND AND
GOVERNOR.
I AM PROUD OF WHAT HE DID FOR
OUR STATE.
HE WAS FOCUSED ON FLORIDA.
I AM FOCUSED ON FLORIDA.
MY SECURE FLORIDA FIRST PLAN
WILL REINSTATE THE RELATIONSHIP
WITH I.C.E. THAT WENT AWAY UNDER
I’M SUPPORTED BY
LAW ENFORCEMENT, PBA, FOP AND 45
SHERIFFS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEEN
BOTH RECORDS AND ENDORSED ME TO
BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR TO KEEP
FLORIDIAN SAFE.
THAT IS WHAT A FLORIDA FIRST
AGENDA IS, AND THAT IS WHAT THE
>> GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU.
STANDBY FOR BREAKING NEWS
UNFOLDING JUST HOURS AHEAD OF
THIS DEBATE, ANOTHER DEADLY
SHOOTING IN OUR NATION THIS
AFTERNOON.
TODAY’S TRAGEDY BRINGS US TO
ANOTHER HOTLY DEBATED ISSUE THAT
HAS LEFT DEEP SCARS HERE IN
FLORIDA.
