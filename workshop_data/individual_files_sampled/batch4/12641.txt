arrivals program is dead or is it or maybe not or kind of but not really that's that's sort of what this was so remember all the people who were in the ann coulter in trump we trust camp they thought that this was going to be like Trump's number one thing he was gonna come in he was gonna deport a bunch of illegal immigrants he was gonna get move out the parents who's gonna take the kids he's gonna dump them all so there was going to be mass deportations there was going to be a deportation squad a deportation force like this is what a lot of people who are on the Trump train from the very beginning thought in fact remember back to the campaign there's a revisionist history going on now where a lot of people say well Trump was always soft on immigration are you insane I was here every day doing play-by-play for the campaign one of the things that Trump did to great effect was bashed the living hell out of people like Ted Cruz who's very strong and immigration has not strong enough on immigration if you recall Donald Trump basically took Marco Rubio's head stuck it in the toilet and then sat on it over the issue of immigration and the gang of eight bill the idea was that you could never give amnesty to anyone well now Trump comes along seven months into his administration instead of getting rid of daca on day one President Obama's executive amnesty on day one he waited for seven months and then he had Jeff Sessions come out and say that this is being rescinded because it's illegal here was Jeff Sessions his Attorney General it shows you how uncomfortable Trump is with the actual policy here that he sends out sessions if Trump were really comfortable he'd go out and announce it himself he did with the plant in the Paris climate change agreement if I recall correctly that is not what happened here here is Jeff Sessions the reason the Jeff Sessions stuck around by the way you remember like a month ago when Donald Trump was just humiliating sessions on a daily basis there's only six weeks ago okay time has stopped we're actually moving backwards in time we've reached 88 miles per hour in the political sphere and we're back in 1955 trying to make sure that Marty's mom and dad get together but time is moving so slowly it was only like six weeks ago that Jeff Sessions is being attacked by President Trump as incompetent and terrible and horrible well Jeff Sessions stuck around because this is the only thing Jeff Sessions cares about ok the illegal immigration issue is one of Jeff Sessions big things I know this because I was at a drinking session in late night drinking session between Ann Coulter Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller as like two years ago three years ago maybe yes three years ago and Jeff Sessions and Steven Miller and Ann Coulter were all hot and heavy over what they were going to do to restrict immigration so this is Jeff Sessions thing okay he loves this so here is Jeff Sessions yesterday look how happy he looks for the first time in months he really looks truly happy with what he's doing here the program known as daca that was effectuated under the obama administration is being rescinded the daca program was implemented in 2012 and essentially provided a legal status for recipients for a renewable two-year term worker authorization and other benefits including participation in the Social Security program to 800,000 mostly adult illegal aliens okay so he's very happy about all of this now he's right that this is unconstitutional okay it was being struck down by the courts this is the weird thing if Trump had just waited for about three weeks they're a bunch of courts that we're gonna strike down Obama's executive amnesty and then he wouldn't have to do anything but he jumped the gun and announced instead that he's getting rid of daca and then throwing it over to Congress so let's start with I got a couple emails yesterday people wanted to know why is daca unconstitutional the reason the tax is unconstitutional is because the President and the Department of Justice do you have prosecutorial discretion okay they can just decide who they want to prosecute and who they don't want to prosecute it does raise questions about a legality when you are just absolving friends and family but they're allowed to do that they do a prosecutorial discretion that's not really the issue here the issue is that Obama went further than that under daca all these people were not just said it wasn't just said they're not gonna be prosecuted for being here illegally they're actually handed work papers okay so the Obama administration without legislative approval went ahead and did all of this that is a is a usurpation of legislative authority the legislature is given the responsibility to decide whether to give amnesty and work papers whether people should be here legally and the executive branch basically decided to overthrow all that that's why it's unconstitutional so session says we're gonna rescind daca and he's obviously very happy about it Trump however has different thoughts Trump is split on this because Trump on the one hand says I won't know these people out on the other hand he also says I want all these people in so here is Trump yesterday literally yesterday saying he has great love for the dreamers have a great life for the folks we're talking about a great love for them and people think in terms of children but they're really young adults I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly and I can tell you and speaking to members of Congress they want to be able to do something and do it right and really we have no choice we have to be able to do something and I think it's going to work out very well and long term it's going to be the right solution okay we have no choice is always trumpian code for I'm not sure I really wanted to do this but we have to do it right this is this is this is what he's saying here now here's the thing that's funny if Trump really the left is going nuts over this of course because if he has a great heart for these people then why is he just making them why is he exposing them to possible deportation the answer would be that he wants his actual answer on what Trump is actually saying here is not that he wants to get rid of daca he's saying I want akka to be permanent I want the legislature to actually make daca permanent okay so he's actually ramming through Obama's executive amnesty as legislation something Obama couldn't do with the Republican Congress Trump wants to do with the Republican Congress okay this is Trump's Nixon in China moment right Nixon campaign in 1968 in 1972 has a very anti-communist guy and then he travels to China and quote-unquote opens China that's what Trump is doing here he campaigned as a very anti-illegal immigrant guy and here he is now saying he wants the legislature can make no mistake this is what he is doing he is announcing publicly that he wants Congress to make Obama's executive amnesty permanent that's what he's saying here and in case he wasn't clear enough here is what he tweeted yesterday he tweeted this threat quote Congress now has six months to legalize daca something the Obama administration was unable to do if they can't I will revisit this issue okay what he's saying here is he wants daca to be permanent he just wants Congress to do it he doesn't want to be blamed for doing it he wants Congress to do it and what's amazing about this is that the entire threat here let's say that your Republican Congress person and you're looking at your base and your base really does not want you to enshrine daca your base hates daca not because of the unconstitutionality issue they hate it mostly because they don't want 800,000 so-called dreamers to be in the country illegally they want some of these people deported so you're a Republican Congress person and here Trump sponsoring downtown your office and he says I want you to pass this and you say well I can't because then I'll get primary mr. president are you gonna protect me from primary and Trump sort of just hides behind the curtain Trump's not gonna protect any of these Republican Congress people from being primaried which is why you're seeing Paul Ryan say I'm not gonna push any bill at all unless Trump explicitly endorses it because he doesn't want because Trump is set up this weird situation where all the Trump people are loyal to Trump but Trump is now pushing a policy that is precisely the reverse of what he's pushing during the campaign I mean let's be frank about this if we're gonna be honest about what Trump is doing here what he's doing here is backtracking on a key campaign promise this is not just me saying it it's Ann Coulter saying it okay Ann Coulter was the biggest trump booster in this election cycle BarNone okay here is what she said on Twitter she said that's great Sarah Huckabee Sanders says Trump wants comprehensive immigration reform exactly what he used to denounce she said Trump's landmark election winning immigration speech 831 16 enforcement first we can't even discuss amnesty until we have a wall weird how Sarah Huckabee Sanders Trump spokesperson obsessively attacks Congress Trump's are not gonna get out of betraying voters on the wall by blaming Congress right so she's absolutely hammering president Trump over all of this and if you are intellectually honest and you thought that Trump was going to actually get rid of daca you should be hammering him too because the fact is what he is now calling for is keeping Jaca and here was the threat that he was going to use right the threat that he was going to use against his homeland Republican Congress people wasn't I need you to pass this bill or I'm in a primary you it was if you don't pass this bill then I am going to go after all 800,000 illegal immigrants and then the Republican Party will become very unpopular so you pass the bill you take the you take the responsibility I'll reluctantly sign it and that will be the way that we worked this thing right that's the way that Trump wants to work it the way Trump wants to work it is he wants Congress to pass executive amnesty he wants to say I had no choice but to sign it they had wall funding right that's what he wants to say and then he wants to turn around and blame Congress for everything and Congress is saying I don't want to do that but Trump's entire threats get Congress to do that is that he's going to be the bad guy right he's gonna step in and start deporting people but in this tweet he says he's not going to do that in this tweet he gives away every bit of leverage he has in this suite he says if they don't pass deca I will revisit the issue meaning maybe I'll leave death had in place after all maybe this is all fake great maybe I'm pretending here so what does this really say that says the Trump doesn't want to get rid of daca okay Trump was doing something that he thinks is going to be just sort of enough facade to fake out his base but it's not really a in actual policy okay it's not an actual policy of changing immigration policy his entire administration is on the same page here Sarah Huckabee Sanders says this is not cold-hearted he's upholding the law but it's not cold-hearted it's not cold-hearted for the President to uphold the law we're a nation of law and order and the day that we start to ignore the fact that we are that then we throw away everything that gives these people a reason to want to come to our country if we stop becoming the country that we were envisioned to be then we throw away what makes us special which makes America unique this president's not willing to do that the previous administration was this one isn't but we want to have real solutions we want to have laws that that address these problems but it's Congress's job to legislate not the president's we actually and we actually want to uphold the Constitution and I think people across this country should be celebrating the fact that they have a president that is standing up and upholding the Constitution as he was elected to this bench again that doesn't wash because he's been calling on Congress to pass exactly the same policy that he's rejecting at the executive level so even if I agree with the constitutional argument which I do I don't understand why Trump's base is not upset with him if he is going to push Congress into basically an amnesty program that he was elected to stop and he was elected to stop remember this is the same Republican Party that rejected President Bush's amnesty program this is the same Republican Party that rejected Marco Rubio for the gang of eight stuff so this notion that Trump can push it and get away with it would be an amazing amazing shifting of the goalposts by a lot of trumps fans if that's indeed what happens now what this means is that there's a conflict between left and right over nothing they basically agree on policy and I'll explain about that in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at blue apron

restaurant okay so here's the amazing thing Democrats and Republicans apparently agree on the dreamers okay Trump agrees that he wants them to stay the Republicans agree that they want them to stay the Democrats agree that they want them to stay so naturally that means that they're clubbing each other in the head with baseball bat because that's how our politics works now the way politics works is that people don't disagree on anything but they have to invest their politics with a deeper meaning and so they people living crap out of each other every single day over virtually nothing understand something the Democrats agree with Trump on daca Trump agrees with the Democrats on daca he wants Congress to pass daca okay the idea that there's any broad disagreement here is insane but that's not the way this is being paint painted so President Obama immediately decides to come back out of the woodwork and bug everyone he we just couldn't get rid of him he goes on Facebook and he decides that he has to defend his executive amnesty here's what he says he says quote immigration can be a controversial topic we all want safe secure borders and a dynamic economy and people of goodwill can have illegitimate disagreements about how to fix our immigration system so that everybody plays by the rules but that's not what the action the White House took tonight is about this is about young people who grew up in America these dreamers are Americans in their hearts in their minds in every single way but one on paper they're brought to this country by the parents sometimes even as infants they may not know what country beside ours they might not even know a language besides English over the years politicians both parties have worked to write legislation they would have told these young people our young people that if your parents brought you here as a child if you've been here a certain number of years and if you're willing to go to college or serve in our military you get a chance to stay earn your citizenship for yours I ask Congress to send me such a bill that bill never came and he goes on and he calls Trump cruel right he says it's cruel what if our kids science teacher or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a dreamer where are we supposed to send her to a country she doesn't know or remember with a language she may not even speak get this notion that if you were brought here as a child you therefore must stay because we have a responsibility to you this has never made sense to me it just thought it's not a good argument it's like saying your parents embezzled so you get to keep the cash okay it may hurt you it's not your fault your parents your file your parent was a criminal but we all live with the legacy of things that our parents did that we're wrong it's the country's decision as to whether people should stay or not this is why I've always thought so weird that when it comes to immigration we always treat people as a class I'm not a big fan of treating people as members of a class as you know right I know the left likes doing this right you're Hispanic or you're black you're an illegal immigrant you're a Jew you're a woman I like treating people as individuals so this seems to me as though we should approach illegal immigrants in the same case-by-case way that we approach people who are trying to come here legally and when my father in law came to the United States with his wife legally he had to go through a rigorous process he had to show that he was employed he had to show that it wasn't a male welfare he had to show that he was going to that he was going to be employed by this employer for a certain period of time I had to have a green car right he had to go through this long process took my wife 10 15 years to get citizenship okay that seems to me the same way that we should treat dreamers that just because you were here from the time that you were two let's say just because you were here from the time you were two that doesn't mean that you are automatically a citizen and that means that the country has the ability to make the decision as to whether you are detriment or benefit to the country or not so that's you it seems to me we should be approaching this on an individual level but the temptation for Democrats is always to treat everybody as a class and then say that if you want to get rid of some members of the class you hate the entire class you understand how this logic works this is how Democrats operate what they do is they say all black people are victims then you say well that's not true some black people are not victims they say you hate black people don't you understand you hate them that's the reason you're targeting black people right now is cuz you hate them these are all black people are victims then they do the same thing with with Hispanics and illegal immigrants they say well all of these dreamers are wonderful people who deserve to stay see well some of them probably are many of them probably are but some of them probably are not and Democrats say how dare you attack the dreamers how dare you attack them I mean there are there are very few dreamers who are very bad people how dare you say some of them should go how dare you say we should screen them how dare you say we should treat them as individuals that means the hate the entire class you must be a racist and this is the routine that Obama is pulling today he says the action taken today isn't required legally it's a political decision and a moral question okay first of all it was required legally but Trump cut his own case for why it was required legally by waiting seven months to do it it's also weird that if you say it's unconstitutional that you're saying the in six months you may reimplemented so the Trump has a case but he's undercut his own case and then Obama continues he says whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general we shouldn't threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own who posed no threat or not taking away anything from the rest of us I'm very sick of this argument again the no-fault through no fault of their own routine is really a bad argument okay there are a lot of people who we were like the vast majority of criminals are criminals technically through no fault of their own not the vast majority but a significant minority of criminals are people who maybe grew up in bad circumstances without any sense of morality and they make decisions because they're stupid and now we put them in jail okay is that their fault you know there's a contingent default this is not quite the same thing I mean if you're born in the United States obviously you have no control over the circumstances of your birth but I mean I would like to apply the same logic to people who are wealthy right why is it the people who are born into wealthy families are supposed to pay all of their estate tax right they're supposed to have all their money given away what are they born rich through some fault of their own was that their fault like we can't determine where we're born but we can determine where we go from there which is why I think we should offer a pathway to citizenship for dreamers who we think ought to stay in the same way that legal immigrants ought to stay but they ought to go to the back of the line he says this con this action is contrary to our spirit and it's common sense business leaders faith leaders economists Americans of all political stripes called on the administration not to do what it did today so you know Obama's going nuts and this is pretty common you're seeing that you're seeing all the Democrats lose their minds Andrew Mitchell she comes out from MSNBC and she says Jeff Sessions used the word illegal aliens that's just offensive it's just terrible it also denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same illegal aliens to take those jobs to say nothing of his use of the word illegal aliens which is offensive to a lot of people and not correct but Michael the fact is I don't know what he's talking about when he talks about the border no what this has nothing to do with the border oh no we certainly that's certainly the correct term I mean the illegal alien just means a person who came here illegally so but again the idea here is that you're a racist if you suggest that that we have to control our borders Joy Behar says the same thing she says it's racist it's racist I mean if the Trump administration is all about jobs a lot of them employ people also by the way but if they're all about jobs and and saving money and having money in the United States then why would you then get rid of py 24 that's the line that he's not about that because none of these kids or people who ever thought whatever ages they are are from Sweden or Norway they're all from these brown so-called brown country brown people who are not white non-white people so this racism involved here and what are they just admitted okay the idea by the way that all dreamers are from Mexico is just not true okay the fact is the dreamers are from a wide variety of countries apparently there are 800,000 undocumented immigrants who are given a daca referral here they are by top countries of origin okay you ready El Salvador's number one at about 28,000 Guatemala is number two hunters is number three Peru's number four then South Korea okay so about 72 hundred seventy three hundred members of the dreamer community who are South Korean okay the Philippines is on this list at five thousand India has 3,000 people on this list okay there there are a lot of people from South and Latin America but that's because we have a contiguous continent with them but the idea that it is only people who are from countries that are that are south of the border that's not technically true it's just not technically true but again the idea is that Trump is a racist if he wants to enforce the border but the problem is Trump doesn't even want to enforce the border okay that's the thing that's amazing Trump isn't even Inc he's not even interested in supporting all these people and I'm going to explain why I think a lot of people are gonna go along with this regardless and it just demonstrates why partisanship has now taken a front seat over good policy on both sides we'll get to that in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at frame bridge so you have a big poster and you want to

left going nuts over this even though they know it's Kabuki theater because they're trying to damage Trump even though Trump's actual intent here is to do the same thing that they want and some of this is on Trump he's playing a double game here on the one hand he's trying to appease his base on the other hand he's trying to signal to everybody that wink wink nod nod I kind of like daca like Republicans are split on this and you're not seeing Trump come down in one direction or another it's kind of fascinating actually Lindsey Graham for example he he sounds exactly like a Democrat when he says to dreamers you've done nothing wrong to the DREAM Act population there are a lot of people in the Republican side of the aisle understand your dilemma and we want to find a fair solution because you you have done nothing wrong you came here as children you've contributed to society you have passed criminal background checks you've demonstrated your ability to be beneficial to the country now in the future the only thing that stands between you and sir in your life is to Congress that cannot be that reassuring okay the Trump is trying to say is that it's Congress's fault Congress should step in and fix all of this and here's the thing the Democrats agree Dianne Feinstein right Democrat senator from California my stage she's not a good senator but she is a bright lady here's what she had to say about Obama's executive amnesty she said Congress should fix this a long time ago daca was executive order legal is what is the law of passage of something I you know they're 10 attorneys general that are prepared to sue I don't want to get into that the point is daca is here and we've got 800,000 young people well your answer indicating your answer indicates that it's on shaky legal ground it is that's why we need to pass a law okay she got ripped up and down by her own party for saying what is obviously true that daca was unshaken legal ground and it's really funny because you're seeing the media go nuts right now look at the uncertainty that's been created by daca yes the uncertainty created by daca is because President Obama decided to use executive executive amnesty instead of trying to get something through Congress that's why there's a uncertainty excuse me he asked all of these people to give up all their information to the federal government knowing full well that the next president could very well strike down daca he was just he had faith that he could use these people as pawns the Democrats have been using these people as pawns for a long time and now President Trump is using these people as pawns as well it's really I find this whole thing really distasteful I got to be honest with you I find it really distasteful because I think there's an honest argument to be made for deportation for a certain number of people who are here illegally and not benefiting the country as a whole again on an individual level but Obama used these people as pawns in 2012 to win re-election he had control of the Congress from 2008 to 2010 he did not do a damn thing on any of this there's been an easy pass is an easy one he could have done this in 2009 he didn't he chose not to and then he used them as pawns in 2012 in order to create this poison pill situation for President Trump and now President Trump in order to appease his base is getting rid of daca just so long as Congress will pass something else I mean he's pledging that if Congress doesn't pass something else he's going to go right back to tackle or at least will consider it is any of this good policy no it's not good policy and it shows you why partes on both sides is destroying the debate everyone on both sides basically agrees on this issue even though they probably shouldn't and yet they're bashing each other's brains ins for this Kabuki theater for their own base because the Democratic base refuses to allow Democrats to work with Trump and the Republican base wants to pretend that Trump is actually not in favor of daca Wow yeah okay so when we come back I'm going to explain to you a couple of things I like in things I hate will do a little bit of Bible

hate there's one thing I hate there really is astonishing today then I want to spend a little bit of time on so let's start with a thing that I like so the thing that I like today is when I was in law school I tried watching the show there's certain shows where I don't know when I was single and in law school and board it was winter very often I would leave the TV on in my room just because you want some company right just just because you want to hear some voices in the room while you're reading an incredibly boring law book and there are certain shows you can't do that with like there are certain shows particularly sitcoms where you can sort of do that but there's certain shows where if you don't watch them closely because there's actually a lot going on then you miss what's going on you don't enjoy the show fully so one of those shows was the wire which I've recommended on the show before when I first watched it I was watching it sort of half distracted it's a show you really have to concentrate on in order to enjoy the show fully because there's too much going on plot wise another show that's like that is Deadwood so when I first watched Deadwood I really was not a big fan I also couldn't get over the cursing there's an enormous amount of cursing in Deadwood it was sort of the way that it was created I'm Claire's guy named David Milch and they use the f-word and the c-word and every every c-word actually that is possible to use they use in that show they use all of these words on a really frequent basis the reason apparently that they used those show that those words is because all of the actual curse words that were used in the Old West things like gall-darn they sound funny to the modern ear so David Milch wanted you to be shocked by the language and how much people cursed back then so he used modern curse words the f-word believe it or not did not come into common currency in the United States and select the 1920s that's when it became an actual common curse word before that the f-word was not a thing now it is amazing how it's become so common that it's it's almost losing its impact the f-word and people are gonna move on to new and more egregiously vulgar forms of language pretty soon in any case Deadwood is all about the the mining community of Deadwood South Dakota this is back during the post-civil war era of like shortly after the Civil War and it's really well acted a lot of the people who are stars on Deadwood are known for the parts that they played on Deadwood particularly I'm thinking of the guy who plays the saloon keep why is his name escaping me now I hid in McShane ian mcshane he's become a big star because of dead what Timothy Olyphant was the star of the show but he's actually the weakest link in the show in terms of acting Keith Carradine it plays a Wild Bill plays Wild Bill Hickok Wild Bill Hickok the guy who who really is the best thing in the show and was under appreciate as Brad Dourif Brad zareff is one of the great actors of our time okay so for people who don't know Brad Dourif watch this show and then watch Lord of the Rings and then watch One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest okay he in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest he plays Billy Babbitt and is one of the single greatest film performances ever because if you read the book and then you watch the movie he is the character he is the I mean he and how it's a character like no one else when he's Grima Wormtongue he is Grima Wormtongue and when he's the doc in this he is the doc Brad Cerf is one of the most underappreciated actors in modern American history he really is terrific he's only had these sort of bit parts but he's amazing in any case the show is really first-rate so you should go and check out Deadwood here's a little bit of the preview sons the cursing it is definitely our two x-rated I would say more r-rated than X but but here here is a here is Deadwood there's a hell on the place it all could get there's a lot of gold out here something terrible's going on you're gonna find out something now about yourselves and your fellow man no one gets out alive okay there's so many terrific terrific kind of character actors in this it really is a showcase for all of these character actors so you get people like powers Boothe right who shows up as side Tolliver you remember him as as curly bill Brocius in Tombstone and he shows up as the rival saloon keep the ian mcshane really a terrific show and and it has some depth to it as well so go and check out Deadwood if you have a taste for that kind of stuff if you are if you're able to if you're able to handle that kind of cursing and HBO level violence and insects okay time for some things that I hate all right so the first thing that I hate today this is an amazing amazing story according to tablet magazine some people working with the US Holocaust Memorial Museum had a desire to whitewash former President Barack Obama for his inaction via via the the visa fees the the conflict in Syria is according to Hank Baron at the Daily wire they colored a new study offered by the museum so it read quote a variety of factors which were more or less fixed made it very difficult from the beginning for the u.s. government to take effective action to prevent atrocities in Syria even compared with other challenging policy contexts they were going to introduce this study on September 11th it was supervised by former Obama national security council and intelligence officer Camus and Cameron Hudson who now serves as director of the Simon showed Center for the Prevention of genocide according to tablet magazine using computational modeling in game theory methods as well as interviews with experts and policy makers the report asserted the greater support for the anti-assad rebels and u.s. strikes on the Assad regime after the August 2013 Goethe chemical weapons attack would not have reduced atrocities in the country and might conceivably have contributed to them so here's the story the Obama administration a bunch of Obama administration officials went to the Holocaust Memorial Museum and they made them write a report they wrote a report retro actively absolving retro actively absolving the Obama administration of responsibility for war atrocities in Syria this is the equivalent of the FDR administration former officials going to the Holocaust Memorial Museum and saying can you write a report saying that we had nothing that if we hadn't bond that it wouldn't made a difference if we had bombed the the train lines to Auschwitz can you do that for us because it might conceivably have worsen things how do you even make that call how do you make that call the whole point of the Holocaust Memorial Museum is that governments should do more to prevent atrocities not to excuse governments for atrocities they didn't prevent Lee as Leon Wiesel tear who's who's a literary critic and an author he's a fellow at the Brookings Institute he said shame on the Holocaust Museum he blasted the museum for releasing an allegedly scientific study that justifies bystander ends bystander ISM he added quote if I had the time I would gin up a parody version of this that will give us the computational modeling algorithmic counterfactual analysis of John J McCloy decision not to bomb the Auschwitz ovens in 1944 I'm sure we could concoct the effing algorithms for that to Tablet noted since the outbreak of the civil war in early 2011 the Syrian dictator has repeatedly attacked civilians with poison gas maintaining a network of prison camps or as many as 60,000 people have been tortured murdered and disappeared their bodies dumped into crematoria and mass graves even Abe Foxman who is a real leftist he said I assume the leadership understands and made a misstep I served three times on the Holocaust Commission the institution is very dear to my heart I believe it's appropriate indeed imperative for the museum to deal with questions of genocide in contemporary current events but in this case several things are happening that are problematic first the genocide isn't over to more broadly I don't think it's appropriate for the museum to issue this kind of judgement that's beyond its mandate so who works for the museum Ben Rhodes Obama's former National Security Advisor who is largely responsible for the Iran deal ok Obama NSC alumni grant Harris Anna cave Daniel Benjamin all worked for Obama at the NSC they are all on the Memorial Council they were all appointed at the end of Obama's tenure just disgusting just disgusting and the museum is offering the following message now by people who wish to pursue peruse the study says last week the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Simon showed sensor for the prevention of genocide released a research study that examined several decision points during the Syrian conflict since her it's released a number of people with whom we have worked closely on Syria since the conflicts outbreak have expressed concerns with the study the museum has decided to remove the study from its website as we evaluate this feedback the question is why they ran it in the first place and the answer is because they're a bunch of Democrats who wanted to absolve other Democrats seasons in a genocide that's what happened here and just demonstrates how fired Democrats are willing to go to cover their own asses when it comes to their complicity in genocide just incredible stuff just incredible the same revisionist history you know that they're constantly accusing people on the right of manufacturing news of manufacturing history this is manufactured news and manufactured history using the guise of a Holocaust Memorial in order to do it just gross all the way through okay other things that I hate so Linda Sarsour who of course is the terror sympathizing woman's march organizer who celebrated all over the left because she wears a hijab she has spent a lot of time recently saying that as a person of color this and as a person of color that well he or she is a few years ago explaining that she's actually just a normal white girl and now she wears a hijab so she's no longer normal white girl when I wasn't wearing hijab I was just some ordinary white girl from New York City wearing hijab made you know that I was Muslim she was just an ordinary white girl you understand but now she's a person of color because she's thrown the hijab this demonstrates that the left likes to conflate activity with ethnic identity okay I am technically a white person I guess I mean Jews have been kind of qualified as white and then not qualified as white but for purposes of the left I'm a white guy I'm still a white guy even though I wear a yarmulke it means I'm identifiable as a Jew in the same way the hijab makes her identifiable as a Muslim but the idea this makes me a quote-unquote person of color is just asinine and what this really means is that for the left the only real people of color are people who are quote unquote victimized by the broader society that's what they're going for so when you slap on a hijab suddenly you're a person of color why not because you're actually a personal color but because you're victimized and this also means that if you're a black person who's a Republican if you are Larry elder if you are Walter Williams if you're Thomas soul if you're Clarence Thomas you're not an actual black person because an actual black person wouldn't act like that an actual black part like Linda Sarsour is more black than Clarence Thomas because Linda Sarsour is a white person who wears a hijab color in other words is just another way for the left to say leftist and that's what you see from Linda Sarsour here she is a self-admitted not person of color by this tape but she calls herself a person of color all the time okay final thing that I hate so the Cleveland Browns have decided that they are not going to a bunch of Cleveland Browns who decided they're gonna kneel for the national anthem and a bunch of the cops said listen I'm not gonna go there and hold the flag so that you can disrespect the flag and Steven Naismith who is sometimes right but it was more often wrong he says that it's disrespectful for the police officers to refuse to hold the flag on the field in response to the Browns protesting the national anthem here's Steven Naismith making the case with the execrable Max Kellerman what's your reaction to the Cleveland officers that they won't carry flags now um I think the P I think they're the ones disrespecting the flag as opposed to the athletes for you to be the benevolent association or anybody else that then stands up and says we will not support an organization who is basically saying they agree with you but they're supporting the rights of their players because those players are American citizens you are disrespecting the flag more than the players are because the players are exercising the rights give it to them okay mrs. logic you constantly hear from the left and is really stupid I'm gonna defunk it really fast okay so they constantly say things like dissent is the highest form of patriotism well depends on dissent from what okay because if dissent is the highest form of patriotism and revolution is the highest form of dissent then revolution is the highest form of patriotism which is weird because that would mean overthrowing the government so that's not super patriotic okay dissent is not always the highest form of patriotism sometimes dissent is the lowest form of patriotism the person who burns the flag is not more patriotic than the person who refuses to stand there and hold the flag while you burn it okay that's it that's it idiocy but this is the sort of deconstruction that you seek when you're attempting to justify unjustifiable behavior it's the players who are making a mockery of the flag and if I decide not to go there and participate in their mockery of the flag good on me good on the cops but again Steven Naismith is coming to this with a pre-arranged conception of who's right and who's wrong the people who are kneeling are right and justified and therefore anyone who impedes their efforts must be wrong okay time for it to Wednesday so a time for a little bit of quick Bible talk so this week the portion of the of the profits that we read in the Jewish community because every week we read a portion of the profits as well as a portion from the Torah is from the Book of Isaiah they're a bunch of different sections from Isaiah that we read in the lead up to the high howl of the High Holy Days Rosh Hashanah is coming up in like two and a half weeks I think and then Yom Kippur is coming up right after that so these are considered the days of atonement for Jews this month is the days of atonement technically are the ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur but these are the month beforehand is considered a time for repentance and and so we like to read about the uplift of repentance returning to God and what you get when you return to God so here is from Isaiah chapter 60 19 through 21 you shall no longer have the Sun for light by day and for brightness the moon shall not give you light but the Lord shall be for you an everlasting light and your God for your glory your son shall no longer set and either your moon shall be gathered in for the Lord shall be to you and everlasting light and the days of your mourning shall be completed and your people all of them righteous shall inherit the land forever a scion of my planting the work of my hands in which I will glory the point that I want to make here is that we live in a very naturalistic world we live in very materialist conception of reality in the last 200 years really since probably David Hume the the deconstruction of the notion that nature is part and parcel of God has taken on rather sinister aspects with regard to religion this notion that nature is is a is a living rebuke to God that there's always a naturalistic explanation for everything's you don't need God God is an unnecessary hypothesis as a philosopher once put it to Napoleon well what this is saying in Isaiah is that really nature is a mask nature is a mask we live in a natural materialistic world and it's impossible for us to detect anything logically beyond that beyond that natural world you can you can come up with rationales but there's no proof for it and so because we live in this materialistic world we think that's all there is what this is saying in Isaiah is that the real light is the light of God that all of the rest of this these are just manifestations of God's nature that he's created for you a world mask as rabbi akiva tats puts it but when it comes down to what is real in the universe there is something beyond there is something outside of Plato's cave there is something that is unseeable but exists beyond the light and that light that true light infuses the nature with which we deal so there's the Sun and for light by day and the moon that we would rely upon but in the end if we're not relying on God then we're living in a universe devoid of meaning and it's not the Sun thing she relied and not the moon you should rely on but the everlasting light of God to infuse the entire universe with meaning and in the end of days when there is repentance then that mask will fall away and we'll all see clearly that nature as beautiful it is it as it is the systems that God created for us to live in they were created by a master hand and that master hand has infused all of it with a meaning that makes your life worth living that's what Isaiah is saying here okay we'll be back here tomorrow we'll give you the update on daca and everything else plus we'll give you the update on this this hurricane that's now headed from Florida a bad year for hurricanes in the United States we'll talk about all of that i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
