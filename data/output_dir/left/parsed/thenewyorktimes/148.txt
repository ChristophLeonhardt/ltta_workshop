We’ve been in the middle of
this really intense debate
over what to do with the
borders of our country
and how to deal with the
questions of:
Who gets to come 
into our country?
How do they come in?
Where do they go?
What happens to them
when they get here?
And you’ve had these two
really interesting extremes
that have been battling for the
last several decades, frankly.
You’ve had a kind of,
one extreme,
which is in the
White House right now:
President Trump; 
Stephen Miller, his top adviser;
Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
“We don’t want
people coming in.”
“Don’t you have kids,
Mr. President?”
And you have the
other extreme,
where you have people who,
you know, argue for much more
liberal open borders,
be much more opening
to refugees,
to asylum seekers.
What sort of climaxed this week
with this family
separation crisis is,
How do you find a solution
that’s in the middle?
The executive order
essentially says
the administration
is now going to detain
families that come across
the border illegally,
and they’re seeking
legal permission
to detain them permanently.
If they can’t get
that legal permission,
which, right now,
rests in the hands
of a single federal
judge in California,
how does the administration
handle these families?
Well, there’s a couple
of different solutions
that have been out
there in the past.
The Obama administration used
ankle bracelets extensively.
They set up these
pilot programs
where the families
would be put in touch,
would have to register with
a nonprofit organization,
with a community-based
organization that
kept tabs on the families.
The rate at which the people
who are in those programs
actually came back
for their court hearings
was very, very high,
in the 90 percents,
which suggested that if you
could create some of these
programs on a national scale,
and really broaden them out,
that you could potentially
satisfy President Trump’s
concerns about these
people just melting away
into the country
and never coming back.
So there are two big
parts to the president’s
executive order:
What’s going to happen
with people going forward?
And then the question
that has arisen:
What’s going to happen
to the people, the children,
who have already been
separated from their parents
over these last several weeks?
On that second question,
the executive order
is actually silent.
It says nothing about
the existing population
of about 2,300 children who
have been already separated
from their parents.
There are huge
practical hurdles
to bringing all of
these people back,
the main one of which
is that the parents
are being held in custody
for criminal proceedings.
They can either
let the families go,
using ankle bracelets, using
community-based programs —
that’s the way
that Obama did it,
that’s the way
that Bush did it,
that’s one option.
Or, the other option
would be to go back
to family separation.
