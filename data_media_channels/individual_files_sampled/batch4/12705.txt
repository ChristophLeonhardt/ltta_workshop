you're a spokesman for the James Dobson family Institute and one of the things that's kind of comical to me is watching the left pick on Donald Trump for his sexual malfeasance but we are on the right and it is sexual malfeasance in your book the legal basis for a moral Constitution you come really hard on the sexual revolution I can't wait to interview about you about the book I think we're going to do it tape an interview next week I hope but but you come down really hard on the sexual revolution when you're supporting a president who has done these things and who clearly lived a life that is not the conservative life that we support does that bother you do you feel as a as a part of the Dobson Institute do you feel that the charges against evangelicals for instance of hypocrisy are valid I really appreciate that question and you know I think the important thing is lived meaning in the past and nothing has come out during his candidacy or during president Trump's tenure as president in his administration that would lead to these types of allegations and the Christian worldview states that you have forgiveness grace does cover all and the fact that these allegations were actually when he was registered Democrat who when he had I think that's really important people can change people can make mistakes I mean even I went through personally a crisis of faith in law school there was a time that I would have identified as a feminist and that's that think Lord that I'm not that anymore that I have refined my understand that was part of the process of writing my book and understanding where these worldviews come from and I think that the evangelical support of President Trump has been has been because he has been I'm so consistent with his protection of religious freedom he's been so consistent with his conservative viewpoints since his candidacy people can change and I think that he has proven that and we should take him at his word
