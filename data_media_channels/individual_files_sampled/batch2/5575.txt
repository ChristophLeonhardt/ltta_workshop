it's time for a look at your money money money many working-class Americans are struggling to make ends meet especially because of the rising cost of housing and instead of a reprieve for the poor it's the richest renters in some major US cities that are getting a break according to a report from the Washington Post rents have fallen for the highest earners while increasing for the poorest in several major US cities since last September overall rents for the poor of increase by 18 percent since 2011 but in cities like Portland and San Francisco the increase has been much steeper in Portland average rents for low earners have risen from about $1,100 a month back in 2011 to $1,600 a month in 2018 that is a 45 percent increase in just seven years in San Francisco the average rent at the bottom of the market climbed from $1,700 in 2011 to $2,600 in 2018 that's a 53% increase meanwhile rents for luxury high-end rentals are decreasing thanks to a glut of new developments these developments sprung up after the Great Recession to handle an influence influx of workers who are moving to areas of concentrated economic recovery the rising cost of housing is compounded by stagnant wages for working-class Americans inflation is up two point nine percent superimpose all day long we can talk about the president loves to talk about wages are going up but if your inflation if the cost of living goes up greater than your wage you can take that four thousand dollars that's all Ryan liked to talk about that people are gonna get at the end of the year or the new kitchen Gary Cohen said people would buy with that for everything if the cost of living is higher than wage growth you don't actually get anything inflation is up 2.9 percent from July 2017 to 2018 outpacing wages which are up 2.7 percent during the same time by the way wage growth is stagnating it slow slower than it was in the last 18 months of the Obama administration now housing costs in combination with stagnant wages is fueling a lot of financial strain for many middle-class families and remember the massive tax-cut it was promised that we would see trickle-down economics it would trickle down to the middle and the bottom and at this moment we're seeing record buybacks and it's because CEOs respond to pressure there are still not enough pressure from the labor force that they'll be able to demand more and while they can't and their cost of living goes up but this income inequality divide that we're living with is only widening hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest interviews and highlights you can get more MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
