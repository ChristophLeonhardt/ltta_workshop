1
00:00:01,029 --> 00:00:03,398
ANOTHER WAY FOR THE DOJ TO

2
00:00:03,398 --> 00:00:04,232
STONEWALL THEM.

3
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:04,532
TRACE?

4
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:05,667
>> Trace: JOHN ROBERTS LIVE.

5
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:08,703
WE'LL GO BACK WHEN THE BRIEFING

6
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:09,037
BEGINS.

7
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:09,737
THANK YOU.

8
00:00:09,737 --> 00:00:10,805
NORTH KOREA SAID THEY'RE

9
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:12,073
SHUTTING DOWN A NUCLEAR TEST

10
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:13,775
SITE AND BRINGING IN FOREIGN

11
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:15,043
JOURNALISTS TO WATCH.

12
00:00:15,043 --> 00:00:20,515
THIS COULD BE FOR SHOW.

13
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:21,716
SCIENTISTS SAY THE SITE

14
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:23,317
COLLAPSED ON ITS OWN AND MAY

15
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:24,352
ALREADY BE USELESS.

16
00:00:24,352 --> 00:00:28,056
THIS IS A VIEW OF THE FACILITY

17
00:00:28,056 --> 00:00:30,158
SIMPLE SPACE PROVIDED BY DIGITAL

18
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:31,225
GLOBE.

19
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:32,192
WE'RE EXPECTING THE NORTH

20
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:34,862
KOREANS TO BLOW UP THE SIDE OF A

21
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:37,231
MOUNTAIN AND SEAL SOME TUNNELS.

22
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:39,333
THERE'S WORD WE COULD SEE VIDEO

23
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,768
OF THE DEMOLITION TOMORROW

24
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:43,337
MORNING THAT DEPENDS ON THE

25
00:00:43,337 --> 00:00:43,671
WEATHER.

26
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:47,175
GREG PALKOT IS LIVE IN SEOUL,

27
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:48,643
SOUTH KOREA WITH MORE.

28
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:48,943
GREG?

29
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:51,746
>> TRACE, PROBABLY THE BEST SIGN

30
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:53,514
ABOUT WHETHER THERE ARE ANY

31
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:57,919
SERIOUS BUMPS IN U.S.-NORTH

32
00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:00,254
KOREA DIPLOMACY COULD BE FOUND

33
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:01,656
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

34
00:01:01,656 --> 00:01:03,558
IT'S ALL ABOUT DISMEMBERMENT,

35
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:05,126
THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT NORTH

36
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:08,930
KOREAN NUCLEAR TEST SITE IN THE

37
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,597
NORTHEASTERN CORNER OF THE

38
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:09,931
COUNTRY.

39
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,699
THIS HAD BEEN PLANNED A COUPLE

40
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:14,402
WEEKS AGO, BEFORE THE RECENT

41
00:01:14,402 --> 00:01:15,770
DIPLOMATIC TURBULENCE.

42
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,871
NORTH KOREA FLEW A SMALL GROUP

43
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:19,240
OF HAND-PICKED INTERNATIONAL

44
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,341
JOURNALISTS TO AN EAST COAST

45
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:22,944
CITY IN THE COUNTRY.

46
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,213
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON A

47
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:26,247
TRAIN RIGHT NOW.

48
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:27,648
SO FAR THEY HAVEN'T LEFT.

49
00:01:27,648 --> 00:01:29,484
SO FAR THE REASON GIVEN IS

50
00:01:29,484 --> 00:01:29,951
WEATHER.

51
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:31,052
IT'S BEEN DAMP HERE.

52
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:32,720
WHETHER THE REGIME IS NOW HAVING

53
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,155
SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT GOING

54
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:35,957
THROUGH WITH THIS, THAT IS THE

55
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:36,324
QUESTION.

56
00:01:36,324 --> 00:01:38,960
AS YOU NOTED, TRACE, THIS IS AN

57
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,294
EASY GIVE FOR NORTH KOREA.

58
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:42,697
MANY SCIENTISTS SAID THAT

59
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:44,432
BASICALLY THIS SITE WAS OUT OF

60
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:44,732
ORDER.

61
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:46,801
THAT YOU COULDN'T USE IT AGAIN.

62
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:49,937
IT DIDN'T MERELY MATTER WHETHER

63
00:01:49,937 --> 00:01:51,038
IT WAS DESTROYED.

64
00:01:51,038 --> 00:01:55,743
BUT TRACE, HUGE SYMBOLIC VALUE.

65
00:01:55,743 --> 00:01:59,413
WILL NORTH KOREA SQUANDER THIS

66
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:00,148
IF THE DATE OF THE SUMMIT IS NOW

67
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:00,481
IN PLAY.

68
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:06,721
BACK TO  NUCLEAR SITE?

69
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:08,656
>> YEAH, SOUTH KOREA, OF COURSE,

70
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:10,358
TRACE, IS WATCHING THIS VERY

71
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:10,691
CLOSELY.

72
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:12,493
WATCHING EVERYTHING VERY

73
00:02:12,493 --> 00:02:12,927
CLOSELY.

74
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:15,062
THEY HAVE A HUMONGOUS AMOUNT

75
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:16,497
INVESTED IN THIS WHOLE

76
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:17,498
DIPLOMATIC PROCESS.

77
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:19,567
IF YOU REMEMBER BACK TO APRIL

78
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:20,968
27, THAT'S WHEN KIM JONG-UN AND

79
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:22,436
SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON MET

80
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:23,871
ALONG THE DMZ.

81
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:26,440
JUST LAST WEEK, AS YOU NOTED,

82
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,376
TALKS BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH

83
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:29,243
WERE CANCELLED.

84
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:31,879
OSTENSIVELY BECAUSE OF ONGOING

85
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,682
BUT THEY KNEW ABOUT THEM

86
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:39,453
EXERCISES BETWEEN U.S. AND SOUTH

87
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:40,087
KOREAN TROOPS AROUND THIS

88
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:40,454
PENINSULA.

89
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:41,222
ALSO, THERE'S MORE STRONG WINDS

90
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:42,356
COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

91
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:43,591
ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION.

92
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:45,459
HERE WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO

93
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:46,561
MORE STRONG WINDS COMING FROM

94
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:46,994
THE NORTH.

95
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,763
AN OLD LINE FROM KIM JONG-UN.

96
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:50,598
THAT IS WHY ACCORDING TO LOCAL

97
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:52,600
MEDIA HERE, PRESIDENT MOON WENT

98
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,570
TO THE D.C. TO SPEAK WITH

99
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:56,838
BIT OF DAMAGE CONTROL.

100
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:58,906
IT ALL GOES DOWN, TRACE, TO ONE

101
00:02:58,906 --> 00:02:59,507
MAN.

102
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:00,942
AGAIN, IT SEEMS ACCORDING TO A

103
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:03,010
COUPLE OF ANALYSTS WE'VE TALKED

104
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,711
TO HERE, KIM JONG-UN.

105
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:05,780
HE'S ABOUT 120 MILES NORTH OF

106
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,415
HERE IN PYONGYANG AND WANTS

107
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:09,116
AGAIN, AGAIN, ACCORDING TO SOME

108
00:03:09,116 --> 00:03:11,686
OF THE EXPERTS, HE'S CALLING THE

109
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:13,254
SHOTS FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE

110
00:03:13,254 --> 00:03:14,889
FOR THIS COUNTRY, FOR THIS

111
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:15,256
PENINSULA.

112
00:03:15,256 --> 00:00:00,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK FOR THE
