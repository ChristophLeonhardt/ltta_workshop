but first Mitt Romney a guy who when he moved to Utah I'm sure a lot of people didn't think that Mitt Romney was going to get back involved in politics he did he won by a massive landslide last night and Willie he won saying I'm going to Washington but I'm not gonna be like Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan I'm not gonna be Trump's puppet if he does something I disagree with I'm gonna speak out imagine that somebody who's consistent that way somebody who when he is appalled by something the president does will say so and it was actually just a couple of days before Utah Republicans chose Mitt Romney as their Senate nominee last night he published an op-ed this is two days before the election declaring his independence from President Trump he wrote this I haven't will continue to speak out when the president says or does something which is divisive racist sexist anti-immigrant dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions I do not make this a daily commentary i express contrary views only when I believe it is a matter of substantial significance he goes on people ask me why I feel compelled to express my disagreement with the president I believe that when you are known as a member of the of a team and the captain says or does something you feel is morally wrong if you stay silent you tacitly attempt to the captain's posture Joe you remember it was just over two years ago during the campaign Mitt Romney delivered that speech he then when President Trump was elected showed a willingness to work with him when it was appropriate but again saying this is as he's trying to be elected in a state where Donald Trump is popular I'm not gonna go along the way Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have I'm gonna be my own man if you don't like that don't vote for me and he won last night by a big margin won by a big margin and Jon Meacham well you know we we haven't been asking much of Republicans on Capitol Hill here we haven't been asking that they where they put Hillary Clinton bumper stickers on the back of of their cars we haven't been asking to wear Bernie for America t-shirts we haven't even asked them to vote moderate let alone liberal let them vote conservative all we've been asking and wondering about is why do they let all the racist comments go by without being openly critical and pushing back on the president why do they let the misogynistic statements go forward without pushing back on the president the attacks on the rule of law the attacks on the constitutional norms MIT Romney did it there on Sunday got elected by 73% I would like to say that the fever is breaking but fevers not breaking because Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are still cowering in the corner and won't call him out for his more destructive policies but is there a historical parallel this isn't quite a have you no shame sir moment but what do you make of Mitt Romney saying that on Sunday in two days later winning a Republican landslide one thing it tells me is that his polls were really good going into the weekend the other thing I think the someone once said there's a reason profiles and courage was just one volume you know there's just there aren't you know a gazillion examples of this and I think that when you talk to senators when you took congressman are a little different as you know but the Senators will say I'm looking at 75 80 % of Republic Republican approval rating in my state and I'm my own view and I said this to a senator recently and fortunately he laughed and agreed with it but it was a close call I said my sense of you sir is that you will throw yourself in front of the train but at the very last minute and I think that's what Romney was saying there I'm not gonna do it every day because let's be honest if you're gonna do it every day you could do you could just be on you know good beat on television I mean it's just a constant Twitter feed on these things I think it's really fascinating and we will parse paragraphs like that forever that a former Republican nominee someone who very nearly became president a moderate Republican the governor of Massachusetts who were more conservative all that is forced to say I'm only gonna comment on racism when it's substantial well knowing him pretty well there's one added factor I would put into the mix here at this stage of his life having experienced everything's experienced success financial success political assess as well as defeat he's a free man yeah it was a free man he will be a truthful man beautiful thing thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
