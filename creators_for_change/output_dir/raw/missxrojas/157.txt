00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone I'm here today at the</font>

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,659
disasters Emergency Committee to talk to

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:04,710
you a bit about the work they're doing

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,109
for Nepal in case you missed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on April</font>

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,630
25th hours of 7.8 magnitude earthquake

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,090
in Nepal and it's taken over<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven</font>

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand lives that's what we know so</font>

8
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,049
far and 14,000 people have been injured

9
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,270
but the numbers get much bigger than

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,470
that when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the people who've</font>

11
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,910
been displaced and who are homeless

12
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,160
there's 2.8 million people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who've been</font>

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,170
displaced that's approximately a third

14
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,300
of London and if you try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> visualize</font>

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,490
it it's kind of impossible big number to

16
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,560
visualize 800,000 people are still

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,870
homeless and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 320,000 of those are</font>

18
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,969
children so there's loads of work to do

19
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,410
I don't know how much you guys know

20
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,790
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> layout of Nepal but there's a</font>

21
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,620
lot of errors a really remote from

22
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,510
landslides and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from both sides and</font>

23
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like that it's really hard for</font>

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
aid workers to get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that's</font>

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,700
been a huge challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> for him so when</font>

26
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,379
the news of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> earthquake first came up</font>

27
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,660
on Twitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the news there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

28
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,129
real sense of urgency from all of us

29
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,199
right we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pitch in we wanted</font>

30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out ways to help but it's been</font>

31
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 days to two weeks and that</font>

32
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,930
sensibility has kind of fallen off a bit

33
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,370
we're not hearing about it as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

34
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the news we're not seeing everywhere but</font>

35
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,580
what we have to remember is that for the

36
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Nepal that sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of urgency is</font>

37
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,869
going to last the next 5-10<font color="#CCCCCC"> years as</font>

38
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,970
they try to rebuild their<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives as they</font>

39
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,890
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> schools back together as they try to</font>

40
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,110
reach the remote areas where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can't</font>

41
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,479
get to and the health system was already

42
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,580
really stretched and so it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

43
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,979
imagine the scale of work things<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

44
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,630
done but we do have to imagine it

45
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,520
because we do have to help out to give

46
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,509
you some idea of the scale the

47
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:28,890
earthquake it was the worst earthquake

48
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,350
informant experience in 81 years so it's

49
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,270
a colossal amount of devastation so how

50
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,560
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have well the disasters</font>

51
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,060
Emergency Committee is actually made up

52
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,610
of 13 member agencies and those are

53
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,720
probably charities you will have heard

54
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,110
of charities like zamak relief and save

55
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,210
the children an Oxfam a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

56
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,770
charities were already working in the

57
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,170
pool so know the area very very well but

58
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,820
obviously this presents a huge new ream

59
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,799
of challenges that they have to tackle

60
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,540
your help will provide everything from

61
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,549

00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,790
hospitals and getting the right people

64
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,619
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ground you can administer the</font>

65
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,390
medical help that these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> need as</font>

98
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,209
important to remember is that these

99
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:05,769
aren't the statistics these are people

100
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,290
they've lost their whole lives they've

101
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,730

homes there's lots of memories and it's

103
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,840
an unimaginable scale of loss as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so</font>

00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,040
earthquake and now and you might see

108
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,540
these on other channels and on other

109
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,340
people's instagrams and things as well I

110
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,139
go to making them dolla as part of an

111
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,579
international show of support and

112
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,290
solidarity with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Nepalese people</font>

113
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,870
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm here now with the CEO of the</font>

114
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,760
disasters Emergency Committee sila and

115
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,290
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to ask you a bit about</font>

116
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,670
the work you guys have been doing within

117
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,200
Apple quake what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> your priorities</font>

118
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,329
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DfE on the ground in</font>

119
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,129
the pool yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> our member agencies</font>

120
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:52,689
would be now making sure that we

121
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:55,269
prioritize to reach as many people as

122
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,400
possible lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> their food</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supplies</font>

123
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,230
they've lost their water supply they've

124
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,209
lost everything so it is essentially

125
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,969
about keeping people safe and helping

126
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:06,519
them survive the next few weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

127
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,439
members would be distributing tents and

128
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">earthlings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people get</font>

129
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,060
warm and dry blankets and mattresses but

130
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,389
also clean water and also multiplication

131
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,639
tablets so essentially for the next few

132
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,829
days and weeks it's reaching as many

133
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,810
people as possible with that kind of

134
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously we'll open up</font>

135
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,340
the

136
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,380
the distributions to<font color="#E5E5E5"> impede more longer</font>

137
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms and how has their remoteness on</font>

138
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,810
these locations presented a challenge

139
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,610
well it's been a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge Nepal is</font>

140
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,860
a very beautiful mountainous country

141
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,740
with very windy roads so a lot of those

142
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,120
rooms have<font color="#E5E5E5"> either being completely</font>

143
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,910
damaged or a blocked because of the so

144
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,860
trying to manage all that and try to

145
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,050
reach even after thousands for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8</font>

146
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,240
million<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that have been effective</font>

147
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,949
is a complete challenge but we are

148
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:55,389
reaching people already in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

149

week of this appeal yeah I members have

150
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,560
reached over 87,000 people with

151
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,960
life-saving air support such as a filter

152
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,690
the shelter and a lot of the member

153
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,040
agencies have set up inflatable

154
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,470
hospitals and remote medical sites how

157
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,150
plan this earthquake in Nepal had been

<font color="#CCCCCC">predicted because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fault lines</font>

159
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,310

160
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,020
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> agencies were already in the call</font>

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,500
for many years<font color="#CCCCCC"> before that preparing for</font>

this kind of disaster hospitals would

have been reinforced schools and being

been all pre-planned we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> upped when</font>

168
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,880
this happened we would all be in a

169
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,380
better place to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure which is many</font>

170
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,900
people as possible but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't mean</font>

171
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's easy but still huge challenge</font>

172
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,760
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention the roads are blocked and</font>

173
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,950
that airport is finally difficult to

come<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and and do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you see it as being</font>

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,230
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> five year tenure challenges well sadly</font>

176
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,020
what the earthquake destroyed in 60

177
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,570
seconds is going to take many many years

come our program to be funding a member

182
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,130
that agencies will be working in the

pool for<font color="#E5E5E5"> decades to come to rebuild with</font>

a mcrib includes the difficulty with a

disaster like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nepal is that its massive</font>

186
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,580
it's so big that none of us individually

192
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,320
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the scale of the need and yet</font>

193
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,840
the reporting of what's happening there

194

doesn't key to keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the need and</font>

195
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,100
as a result with terribly apt to forget

196
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,860
in fact it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> too painful to think</font>

197
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,410
that these are humans like us who have

198

homes have<font color="#CCCCCC"> love and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly this</font>

199
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,060

200
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,310
kind of keep up that human aspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

201
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,510
forefront of our minds when we think

202
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,460
about disasters like this well it's

203
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually very easy for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because we can</font>

204
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,900
use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> social network and and we can</font>

205
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,420
keep people<font color="#CCCCCC"> posted and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think I think</font>

responding but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just have to keep it</font>

208
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,290
going because you know we we were

209
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,050
amazing with Haiti the largest<font color="#CCCCCC"> some ever</font>

210
