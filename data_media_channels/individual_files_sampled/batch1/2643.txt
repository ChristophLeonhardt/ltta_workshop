very often it can just seemed like meaningless bubble very hard to predict what actual direction he's going to go in with his speeches because he tends to go off script a lot in general he tends to speak in very broken English and very short sentences he doesn't use multiple causes in the sentences for example he tends speaks very much to his audience in a particular context and when you try and decontextualize that and translate it into another language you remove that context to some extent so it's very difficult then for the reader to understand what exactly he's talking about it may actually be a little bit more rehearse than we think he is speaking to a particular audience and I think he addresses them in the kind of language that they want to hear which doesn't then translate very well into the type of language that readers expect to find in a newspaper or a magazine or whatever
