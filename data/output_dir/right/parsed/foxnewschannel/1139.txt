STATEMENT ONCE THE RESULTS COME
IN.
SHANNON?
>> Shannon: PETER DOOCY, WE'LL
CHECK BACK IN WITH YOU ON THIS
BUSY NIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE'LL GET YOU RESULTS AS SOON AS
THEY COME IN THIS HOUR.
STAY WITH US.
DEMOCRATS HOPING TO GET THE
RIGHT MIX OUT OF THAT JUNGLE
PRIMARY, WHAT HAPPENS IN
CALIFORNIA COULD BE KEY TO
DEMOCRATS EFFORTS TO END THE
MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE.
JOINING ME TO BREAK THIS DOWN, A
NUMBER OF HOT ISSUES, SENIOR
CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER CHAD
PERGRAM.
CHAD, LET'S START BY TALKING
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN
CALIFORNIA TONIGHT.
WHY IS THIS PRIMARY RACE SO
PIVOTAL TO THE BIGGER PICTURE OF
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MIDTERM?
>> WELCOME OF THE GOLDEN STATE
IS IN FACT GOLDEN FOR BOTH
PARTIES HERE.
THINK ABOUT THIS, THE DEMOCRATS
WERE TO WIN THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOUT
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOU2
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOU1
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOUS
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOUA
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOUS
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOU.
THERE ARE POTENTIALLY NINE SEATS
IN CALIFORNIA.
AS PETER SAID, DEMOCRATS ARE
FLOODING THE ZONE, SO MANY
DEMOCRATS ON THE BALLOT IN THESE
RACES HERE, THEY ARE DILUTING
THEIR OWN VOTES.
YOU COULD HAVE WITH A JUNGLE
PRIMARY, MAY BE TWO DEMOCRATS,
MAY BE A DEMOCRAT AND
REPUBLICAN, OR TWO REPUBLICANS
AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET.
THAT LOCKS THESE MEMBERS OUT
HERE.
IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET THE
MAJORITY, CALIFORNIA IS A BIG
PRIZE.
THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRATS.
GRANTED, THEY CAN MAKE UP THE
DIFFERENCE IN PLACES LIKE
VIRGINIA, WHERE THERE ARE SOME
RACES, COLORADO, MAYBE FLORIDA,
BUT CALIFORNIA IS THE BIG PRIZE.
>> Shannon: IT IS A BIT OF A
PROXY WAR BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WHO
WANT TO BE THE NEXT SPEAKER OF
THE HOUSE.
>> YOU HAVE NANCY PELOSI, WHO
WANTS TO RETURN TO THE
SPEAKERSHIP, KEVIN McCARTHY,
WHO WANTS TO BE THE SPEAKER,
REMEMBER, PAUL RYAN IS RETIRING
AT THE END OF THIS CONGRESS.
AT WHICHEVER PARTY KIND OF
FORGES AHEAD HERE, THIS IS HOME
TURF IN CALIFORNIA, IF
THOSE TWO LEADERS SHOW THEIR
BONA FIDES AND MAYBE THE
REPUBLICANS CAN LOOK AT THE
DEMOCRATS, MAYBE NANCY PELOSI
CAN BRING THINGS HOME FOR THE
DEMS, THIS PORTENDS THEIR FUTURE
IN CALIFORNIA.
WE'LL KNOW A LOT ABOUT WHAT
PARTY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HOLD
THE ROWS HOUSE OF
