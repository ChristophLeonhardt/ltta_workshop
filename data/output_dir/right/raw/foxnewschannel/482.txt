1
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:10,918
>> Tucker: TWO WEEKS AGO ONE

2
00:00:10,918 --> 00:00:11,985
PERSON ACCUSED BRETT KAVANAUGH

3
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:13,954
OF ACCUSING A SEX CRIME IN

4
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:14,355
1982.

5
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:16,123
FOUR OTHER PEOPLE PRESENT DENY

6
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:16,557
IT HAPPENED.

7
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:18,025
THOSE ARE THE FACTS WE HAVE ON

8
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:18,826
THE TABLE.

9
00:00:18,826 --> 00:00:20,294
FOR THIS, THE LEFT HAS CALLED

10
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:22,396
HIM A SEX CRIMINAL AND AN

11
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:23,497
ATTEMPTED RAPIST AND TRIED TO

12
00:00:23,497 --> 00:00:26,167
DESTROY HIS LIFE.

13
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:27,468
HE FOUGHT BACK YESTERDAY.

14
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:29,437
NOW HIS PERSECUTORS HAVE A NEW

15
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:31,338
ARGUMENT.

16
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:31,739
WATCH.

17
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:32,973
>> WE KNOW ONE THING, HE DOES

18
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:34,642
NOT HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE

19
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:35,443
A JUDGE.

20
00:00:35,443 --> 00:00:37,845
>> HE BASICALLY HAD A TANTRUM

21
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,013
AND SHOWED THAT HE DOESN'T

22
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:41,182
HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE A

23
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:42,750
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

24
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,485
>> FELT LIKE OH, THAT IS WHAT

25
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:45,886
HE IS LIKE WHEN HE IS ANGRY

26
00:00:45,886 --> 00:00:47,788
AND BELLIGERENT WHEN HE IS

27
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:48,155
DRUNK.

28
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:49,423
>> HIS TEMPERAMENT IS NOT

29
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:49,924
SUITED.

30
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,692
>> MY OPPOSITION SOLIDIFIED

31
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:55,062
BECAUSE OF TEMPERAMENT AND

32
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:58,533
FITNESS, WHICH I BELIEVE HE

33
00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:58,966
LACKS.

34
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,935
>> Tucker: SENATOR

35
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,036
BLUMENTHAL DELIVERING HIS

36
00:01:02,036 --> 00:01:02,670
VERDICT HERE.

37
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,272
CHRIS HAHN AN ATTORNEY AND

38
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,808
RADIO HOST AND FORMER AIDE TO

39
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:07,842
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER AND HE

40
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:08,509
JOINS US TONIGHT.

41
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:10,244
THIS IS THE MOST OR WELLIAN

42
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:11,079
ARGUMENT I HAVE SEEN.

43
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,548
YOU ATTACK A GUY, AN ATTEMPTED

44
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:14,716
RAPIST AND A DRUNK, SOMEONE

45
00:01:14,716 --> 00:01:15,083
UNFIT.

46
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,517
NOT JUST TO BE A SUPREME COURT

47
00:01:16,517 --> 00:01:17,619
JUSTICE BUT TO LIVE IN THIS

48
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:17,986
COUNTRY.

49
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:19,887
WHEN HE GETS MAD ABOUT IT AND

50
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:21,289
HE DEFENDS HIMSELF, YOU SAY

51
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,390
LOOK AT HIM.

52
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,425
HE IS AN ABUSER BECAUSE HE GOT

53
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:24,826
MAD.

54
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:25,360
WHAT?

55
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,596
THAT IS TOO UNFAIR, ACTUALLY.

56
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:30,531
>> WELL, WHEN YOU ARE WEAK ON

57
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:34,736
THE LAW, -- WEAK ON THE FACTS,

58
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:35,470
POUND THE LAW.

59
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:40,575
IF YOU ARE WALK ON THE LAW,

60
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:42,010
POUND THE FACTS.

61
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,478
IF YOU ARE WEAK ON BOTH, YOU

62
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,546
POUND THE TABLE.

63
00:01:45,546 --> 00:01:49,284
IT WAS A DISAPPOINTING DISPLAY

64
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:50,685
BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH, JUDGE

65
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:51,119
WOULD ACCEPT.

66
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,587
I WORKED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS

67
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:53,521
AND I WORKED IN THE STATE

68
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:54,055
COURTS.

69
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:55,190
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING

70
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,757
LIKE THAT.

71
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:58,226
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU

72
00:01:58,226 --> 00:01:59,727
ACCEPT FROM A LEVEL-HEADED

73
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:00,161
JURIST.

74
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:00,795
>> Tucker: OKAY.

75
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:02,897
BUT THE LEVEL-HEADED JURIST

76
00:02:02,897 --> 00:02:04,933
WAS JUST ACCUSED OF A SEX

77
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:05,466
CRIME.

78
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:08,036
HE SAYS HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

79
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:09,737
HIS REPUTATION HAS BEEN

80
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:10,170
DESTROYED.

81
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,239
HE WILL NEVER WORK AGAIN

82
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,340
UNLESS HE GETS THIS JOB.

83
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,274
YOU KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE.

84
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:16,811
IF I SAID HEY, CHRIS --

85
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:20,115
>> NO, THIS IS A LIFETIME

86
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:20,582
APPOINTMENT.

87
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:23,251
>> Tucker: IF SOMEONE SAID

88
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,020
ANONYMOUSLY THAT YOU ARE A

89
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,353
RAPIST.

90
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,521
I WILL TELL YOUR KIDS ABOUT IT

91
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,689
AND THEY WON'T SPEAK TO YOU

92
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,790
AND YOUR NEIGHBORS WON'T SPEAK

93
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,291
TO IT.

94
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:29,958
THIS HAPPENED TO ME.

95
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:30,759
I WAS UPSET.

96
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,429
IS IT OKAY BECAUSE IT'S

97
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:35,764
LEGITIMATE TO BE UPSET.

98
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,699
>> I WOULD NOT BE BEHAVING

99
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,601
LIKE A SUPREME COURT JUDICIAL

100
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:40,235
NOMINEE.

101
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:42,337
HE IS A SUPREME COURT JUDICIAL

102
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:42,938
NOMINEE.

103
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:45,040
WHO SHOULD ALWAYS PRESENT

104
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,708
HIMSELF AS --

105
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,542
>> Tucker: HOW SHOULD

106
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,144
SENATORS BEHAVE?

107
00:02:49,144 --> 00:02:51,446
ESPECIALLY THE MEMBERS OF THE

108
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:52,180
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE?

109
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,149
SHOULD THEY BE HONEST AND

110
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:54,449
FAIR?

111
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,751
TRYING TO DESTROY HIM?

112
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:57,953
>> DO WHATEVER THE VOTERS

113
00:02:57,953 --> 00:02:58,353
ACCEPT.

114
00:02:58,353 --> 00:02:59,354
SENATORS STAND BEFORE THE

115
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:00,922
VOTERS AND ARE APPROVED BY THE

116
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:01,289
VOTERS.

117
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:03,525
THIS MAN STANDS BEFORE

118
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:03,959
CONGRESS.

119
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:04,793
>> Tucker: HOWEVER VOTERS

120
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:05,460
WILL ACCEPT?

121
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,129
>> HE IS GOING FOR A LIFETIME

122
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:07,629
APPOINTMENT, SIR.

123
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,531
A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT.

124
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:09,998
TUCKER, C'MON.

125
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:11,333
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGHER

126
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:11,800
STANDARD.

127
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,168
>> Tucker: THAT WAS THE MOST

128
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:14,369
REVEALING ANSWER I GOT.

129
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:14,870
IT'S FRIDAY.

130
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,638
AT THE END OF THE SHOW --

131
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:17,439
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

132
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,443
>> Tucker: TOOK THIS LONG TO

133
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:23,745
GET A CLEAR ANSWER.

134
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:27,048
BEHAVE HOWEVER THE VOTERS

135
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:27,449
WANT.

136
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:28,416
>> YOU ALWAYS WANT A CLEAR

137
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:28,817
ANSWER.

138
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:29,584
>> Tucker: I'LL THINK ABOUT

139
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,385
IT ALL WEEKEND.

140
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:31,486
ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

141
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:33,388
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

142
00:03:33,388 --> 00:03:35,257
STATES, DONALD TRUMP SAID

143
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,258
SPECIFICALLY THERE SHOULD BE

144
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,325
NO DOUBT.

145
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:38,794
HOW COULD WE HAVE NO DOUBT

146
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:39,361
AFTER YESTERDAY?

147
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:41,496
SORRY, THERE IS PLENTY OF

148
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,732
DOUBT OF KAVANAUGH'S STORY.

149
00:03:43,732 --> 00:03:44,199
ABSOLUTELY.

150
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,134
>> Tucker: I'M NOT A

151
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:46,902
PARTISAN REPUBLICANS.

152
00:03:46,902 --> 00:03:47,769
I DON'T LIKE THE REPUBLICANS

153
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,070
MUCH.

154
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,137
I WATCHED THEM YESTERDAY AND I

155
00:03:49,137 --> 00:03:49,905
FELT FOR HIM.

156
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:51,940
I TURN ON THE OTHER CHANNELS

157
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,642
AND THAT ARE LIKE "WHITE

158
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:54,042
PRIVILEGE!"

159
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:55,110
WE DON'T SEE THE WORLD THE

160
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,445
SAME WAY AT ALL.

161
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,646
>> THE QUESTION, THE

162
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:59,848
QUESTION -- DID YOU BELIEVE

163
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:00,249
HER?

164
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:00,983
>> Tucker: I BELIEVED HER.

165
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,551
I THINK SHE THINKS SHE IS

166
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:03,151
TELLING THE TRUTH.

167
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:04,286
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE SHE IS

168
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,487
TELLING THE TRUTH BUT I

169
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:06,388
BELIEVE SHE BELIEVES IT.

170
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:07,256
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE.

171
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:09,057
THERE IS AN IMPORTANT

172
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:09,458
DISTINCTION.

173
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,726
I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

174
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:11,460
OUT OF TIME.

175
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,561
CHRIS, THANK YOU.

176
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:14,663
>> MOST PEOPLE RELIVING A

177
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:15,464
TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE DON'T

178
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,832
HAVE EVIDENCE OF IT 30 YEARS

179
00:04:16,832 --> 00:00:00,000
LATER.
