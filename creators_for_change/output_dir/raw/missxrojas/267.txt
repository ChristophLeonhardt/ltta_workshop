00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,939
briefly let us go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to Madrid where</font>

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,710
when I last left you it was looking at

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,899
the sky full of birds and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the late onset</font>

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,880
of A Midsummer Night I spent one of my

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,650
final days in the city<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking to the</font>

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,660
reina sofia to see the dali exhibition

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,519
and the permanent collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> Clara</font>

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,010
latina and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> royal palace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Placer my</font>

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,630
yard and through the streets in between

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,850
it was walking through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> streets that</font>

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,350
I began<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notice how much graffiti</font>

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,410
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Madrid big bright colors a bit</font>

13
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,449
often painted on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> greats that will</font>

14
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">cool down in front of shops at night I</font>

15
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,830
remembered very clearly reading Norman

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,870
Mailer's piece the face of graffiti at

17
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">vassar above all the line for six and a</font>

18
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,219
half centuries we have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving from</font>

19
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,230
the discovery of humanity into the

20
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,230
circulation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name when these shops</font>

21
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,300
stop selling shoes and clothes and

22
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,890
miniature<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clothes off</font>

23
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the day the name and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ego occupies</font>

24
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,329
the space in a way many regard is

25
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,829
transgressive because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not seen as</font>

26
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,739
an authentic use of the space but as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

27
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,000
walked outside the railings of the

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,980
palace and in the quiet of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cathedral</font>

29
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,899
where there was a uniform<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a set</font>

30
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,090
volume to obey I was reminded that

31
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,890
graffiti is not the only way in which we

32
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,770
claim spaces we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> claims faces</font>

33
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,780
we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so long that untouched</font>

34
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,600
loses its meaning not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much time</font>

35
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,220
has passed that Spain had a dictator

36
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">whose claim over the space was absolute</font>

37
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,000
when you think in those terms it's no

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,670
wonder Madrid is so covered in<font color="#CCCCCC"> graffiti</font>

39
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,750
and then many have said that their

40
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,400
aversion to graffiti is down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,869
that it's a decoration we have no

42
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,850
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> over but we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have no say about</font>

43
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,650
billboards and buildings for the most

44
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,950
part so why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on graffiti</font>

45
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,600
there's a theory in urban sociology if

46
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,640
the surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the city has broken</font>

47
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,950
windows or graffiti it<font color="#E5E5E5"> fosters a sense</font>

48
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,100
that crimes authorized<font color="#E5E5E5"> amiss it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> E but</font>

49
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,630
there's a better angle I think and it's

50
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,119
partly<font color="#CCCCCC"> male is and partly mine that</font>

51
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,380
graffiti is powerful because it

52
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,909
celebrates that the city is out of

53
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,040
control and celebrates the<font color="#CCCCCC"> scent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

54
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,030
when I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> here someone else was in</font>

55
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,259
criticizing graffiti are we trying to

56
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">escape the reality of other people</font>

57
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,490
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's partly what so</font>

58
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,780
disappointing about the attempt to get

59
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,399
rid of the graffiti on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> south bank in</font>

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,140
London because it feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

61
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,880
generation already inclined to fill

62
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,160
ignored as being raised with white

63
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,970
spirit and paint and what's worse that

64
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,370
arisia is

65
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,640
easy

66
00:02:21,160 --> 00:00:00,000
