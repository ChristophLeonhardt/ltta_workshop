new heat on michael cohen as he's busted for a trump tower russia meeting that has never been disclosed before michael cohen secretly met with a sanctioned russian billionaire just eleven days before donald trump's inauguration a meeting that was publicly exposed today and is now under investigative scrutiny and there's video cohen met with Viktor Vekselberg at Trump Tower now if that name rings a bell tonight it's because it is the very same oligarch questioned by mullahs investigators the same oleg arc behind the company that funneled half a million dollars to Michael Cohen's shell company that yes paid stormy Daniels now the context is key vekselberg is considered so clearly and blatantly close to Putin that even the Trump administration has sanctioned him he's not a Russian government employee per se he's actually something much more important supremely wealthy Russian government fixer who does things for Putin like spending millions on Faberge eggs that were supposed to come back to Russia for a Kremlin display case so keep that in mind when you recall that Michael Cohen has not only disclaimed any outreach to Russia but he's also said he doesn't talk to Russian government people I'm telling you I was not in Prague they claimed that they had photos of me with some Russian government people said you have any hope did you see any hookers why you were in prize ever been to project I've never been to Russia release the photos well look at it like this tonight if you string enough photos together you get moving images and here are some photos to release here's the video this is airing on MSNBC for the first time tonight showing the Russian government linked oligarch and his cousin entering Trump Tower to meet with Michael Cohen since they were caught on tape you're looking at it there aren't really any denials on this part of the story tonight instead Vekselberg flying to the New York Times that this meeting was about a quote mutual desire to strengthen Russia's relations with the u.s. under Trump and Cohen would go on to get money from that firm linked to Vekselberg and the very same week Donald Trump was still publicly touting Cohen whether he was going to get an administration job or not Michael Cote I was being Michael Kohn is a very talented lawyer is a good word my first I have happening those statements there at that press conference during the transition in that key time that we know the meeting took place Trump arguing that basically he'd stayed away from Russia since his last trip in 2013 so here is what's big tonight forget all the Trump conspiracy theories that's the pushback look at why the temperature is so high in the White House this news adds to the evidence that Russia was more than willing to come to trump and to his very close confidant that he was praising in public that very week I'm joined by Maya Wiley an attorney and former counsel of the mayor of New York and former Vermont governor and DNC chair Howard Dean Maya what does this mean for the investigation well basically it means that Michael Cohen is in deep trouble deep trouble because these there have been clear connections we already knew that there was an email exchange between him and Felix aider in 2015 when they were trying to create the Moscow Trump hotel right that that if that he could get them to Putin that he could get help create that relationship and that they could get their boy elected right so there they're actually emails that suggest the relationship that includes both business dealings and winning the presidency we don't know more about what that means but now you have the fact that he has closed meetings remember that Vekselberg was a person who gave whose cousin in later actually was supporting the Trump presidential campaign supported the inauguration and that he was at the inauguration with Trump himself trader who's a big part of this money trail axel Burke's cousin he's and his cousin so this is all in the family and then consider the fact that we don't know everyone that Muller's interviewed but we do have a growing list from from the leaks that come from a lot of witnesses and so what's fascinating is Bob Miller has focused mostly Americans and a lot of people involved in the Trump campaign which makes sense but when it comes to foreigners one of the people he has interviewed is this same person that we just showed caught on tape in this video New York Times noting earlier this year Miller's investigators stopped Vekselberg at an airport when he was flying on a private jet in New York Mulder's investigators interviewed mr. in traitor twice focusing on his dealings with quote mr. Cohen it seems that as Moore comes out this is a bigger part of the Russia collusion probe than was initially understood that's absolutely right because what we need for a conspiracy which is essentially what we'd be talking about is an agreement between more than one person Trump would have to have some knowledge and connection to it but he wouldn't have had to take any direct action personally necessarily if he knew about it he knew about the criminal intent if there was criminal intent and so this is some of the things that put us much more closely in that circle of potential conspiracy which really is the brass ring for Moeller the brass ring Howard Dean that's a lot of the the law there's also the politics which is the extraordinary way that the Republican National Committee is keeping Cowan on board take a look at this new today Michael Cohen last time we spoke you told me he was still working as a deputy finance chair for the RNC is that still the case it is still the case you know there's ongoing litigation and we'll take it step by step but yes he is still Howard this is very dangerous and Trump is really infected the entire Republican Party with his swamp he is the swamp and he has brought the swamp to Washington the thing that's astonishing about it is how how uncaring the money around when you follow the money around if this this Russian oligarch it was close to Putin okay $500,000 to Cohen and Kony use it for Trump's benefit that's obstruction of justice the I think the RNC is now at risk of being charged with obstruction of justice for hire and Cohen in what it most likely is a no-show job to keep him his of water expense wise while he gets investigated these guys you know we're all talking about this really confusing stuff for the general public on television mower has a paper trail which shows a hell of a lot of money being laundered this I gotta believe this is really dangerous for the Republican Party right and the fact that maybe the Republican Party feels that they're in deep enough that it looks bad to get going out because it's a kind of an admission but keeping them in also obviously looks bad but I want you both to stay with me I want to add clearance page a Chicago Tribune columnist and one of our Washington experts Clarence there's paola there's pay to play and then there's actual chargeable corruption how is this playing in Washington a town that does have low standards but still well if I can paraphrase the president who knew that collusion charges could be so complicated indeed we're simply seeing tentacles going out in various directions here we knew that mr. Trump and his family were very much involved with Russian financiers but what group learning is how many different branches there are here and also Michael Cohen's role central role in connecting parts of the money flow what we don't know is how much the president knew and when did he know it if I could borrow a Watergate period phrase but that may be the central question that we're really poking at here meanwhile as we can see as we move up the ladder people like Michael Cohen are putting themselves and since some complexity here yeah an Andrew and trader who my Wylie was mentioning as one of the people who basically carries out what this Russian billionaire wants to have happen oddly kind of telling the New York Times about what it was like visiting Michael Cohen during that period I remember walking in and seeing lots of boxes because Michael was packing up his office and looking forward to hanging out his own shingle mister in traders said Clarence what do you make of that or is he just not care and so after they throw their money around or engage in whatever various levels of pseudo collusion or not they'll just talk to American media about it well Cohan certainly did have have quite a building a growing Empire there about connections I we're learning more all the time here and and he was operating right out of Trump Tower in addition so it does look like it's certainly part of the Trump empire but but we haven't really established is how firm the connections are and how much of President the president knew at that time as he was a becoming president our Dean does any of this stick to the president politically because even if it's not all the basis for charges it's literally a lot of the things he accused Hillary Clinton of or is this such a hyper polarized environment and the Russia probe has a legal component which we always try to cover in a clear legal way here but it's obviously politically viewed through quite a prism out there it's very much sticks to the president outlet could be a fascinating example National Public Radio had a story this morning talking about the schism between conservative Catholics and the evangelicals the evangelical so-called Christians are all in with Trump regardless of his a morality the Catholics are not and the bishops are very upset about his immigration policy his policies towards poor people and so the morality of Trump has infected his support you know he was helped by a lot of working-class people many of whom were Catholic he's going to get a much smaller percentage of the Catholic vote vote in in 2018 and 2020 as a result of I think the bishops disgust with this kind of behavior Clarence well you know I covered Chicago politics for a lot of years just fascinated by the complexities of the corruption but also by how much how many Chicago citizens especially under the first Mayor Daley supported the mayor as long as he got the garbage cans picked up and the standard snow cleared from the streets this is how Trump supporters are judging him now they're looking at the positive impact on their lives is that like instead of like clearing the garbage it's it's just pressuring the NFL and speech policy is that the proverbial garbage in this analogy yeah I remember during the Watergate scandal most folks in the Midwest didn't seem to relay know about the complexities up and didn't really extend to care until Nixon resigned and then everybody said all this was serious wasn't it and then began to figure out just why the president resigned that's where we are right now with this new series of scandals as they come out there they are complicated and folks wonder where is all this going to end so in the meantime Trump and his supporters are playing on the public's impatience saying molars been at this too long and he needs to stop well that's just not going to happen but I think we are gonna have to try to pay attention here to these complexities well and my I think complexity although it's a fair point from our panelists see but I think complexity can become a kind of a Dodge if you're selling out the government for personal benefit the way you do it might be complex because you might be a sneaky lawyer I mean that's fine but I think people understand what it means to sell out the story is fairly straightforward the facts that would be necessary to prove it are the complicated part so if it's pretty if if remember that one of the things that happened in Watergate is there was a smoking gun it was the tapes right and that really wasn't really the obstruction of justice charges that it that really got Nixon it was the fact that he was on tape clearly engaging in a criminal within criminal intent right and I think part of the complexity here is going back to what Clarence is saying is where and how are we gonna get information about Trump's direct connection to what Miller is investigating but the point here is there's so much that points to it right so if we have Donald Trump jr. actively saying I want those emails that might implicate Hillary Clinton and then Trump his part of his obstruction is he's not just he's not he's not just saying oh I'm gonna fire Comey he's actually changing the story about why certain and why about why he was even meeting with a Russian attorney in June in Trump Tower and so when we put the whole all the pieces together the story seems pretty straightforward there's so much lying going on Trump himself has been lying actively and aggressively in ways that are public record right now for the public the question is why lie if you didn't do anything wrong why lie and how are we gonna believe that you your son was doing something yet didn't know he was doing when your actual campaign was primarily led by your family so I think those parts of the story are fairly clear I don't think the American public as we've seen from the most recent polling believes Donald Trump tells the truth we only 13 percent of Americans believe that he tells the truth I think over time this really starts to erode politically for the Republicans and I think the problem for our country is we have to be very careful how far we let it go because we have institutions of government that need to work that we need to protect if we're gonna have a democratic process hey I'm already melbourne
