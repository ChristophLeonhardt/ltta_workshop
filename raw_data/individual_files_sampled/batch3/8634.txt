OWN LIFE, KEEP US POSTED WITH THIS LAWSUIT IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO WATCH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. NOW TO OUR OTHER TOP STORY, ALICE JOHNSON A FREE WOMAN TONIGHT AFTER A GRANT OF CLEMENCY FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP AFTER 22 YEARS SHE SPENT IN FEDERAL PRISON FOR CHARGES RELATED TO DRUG POSSESSION AND MONEY LAUNDERING. ALICE JOHNSON AND HER ATTORNEY ARE HERE, HOW IS IT FEELING 24 HOURS IN? HOW DID IT FEEL WHEN YOU WOKE UP IN YOUR HOUSE THIS MORNING? I FELT WONDERFUL, NO MORE BUNK BEDS OVER HEAD. Martha: IT'S A REMARKABLE STORY. IS IT THINKING AND FOR YOU BECAUSE IT HAPPENED VERY FAST. IT HAPPENED SO FAST, IT IS REALLY NOW JUST STARTING TO SINK IN, TODAY HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL DAY FOR ME, I'M SO HAPPY, NOTHING BOTHERS ME. Martha: YOU EXPECTED TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN PRISON, I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH 22 YEARS? HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH ALL THAT TIME? THE ONLY WAY I WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH AND THIS IS THE TRUTH IS MY FAITH IN GOD. I KNEW ONE DAY HE WAS GOING TO BRING ME OUT AND I LIVE MY LIFE WITH AN EYE TOWARD ONE DAY WALKING OUT OF THOSE DOORS A FREE WOMAN. THE DAY I GOT THE NEWS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD GRANTED MY CLEMENCY AND GIVEN ME A SECOND CHANCE IT WAS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE. Martha: YOU SAY YOU WANT TO BRING THOSE STILL LEFT BEHIND, I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE BAD MOMENT JUST FOR A MINUTE IF I COULD. YOU WERE IN DESPERATION, YOU LOST YOUR JOB AT FEDEX AND YOU TURNED TO CRIME. YOU WERE AN INTERMEDIARY FOR THEM, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO SOMEONE WHO FINDS THEMSELVES FACED WITH THAT SAME KIND OF MOMENT IN THEIR LIVES. I WOULD SAY DON'T MAKE A PERMANENT DECISION THAT CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE BASED ON A TEMPORARY SITUATION. JUST BECAUSE YOU GO INTO PANIC, TAKE YOUR BREATH AND WAIT IT OUT. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. THAT ONE MISTAKE COST ME NOT TO BE ABLE TO BE THERE FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN, IT CHANGED THE COURSE OF MY ENTIRE LIFE, DON'T DO IT THAT'S WHAT I SAY. DON'T DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL FOR SOME TEMPORARY GAIN BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU IT IS A TRIP. Martha: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HELP OTHERS WHO YOU FEEL IT REALLY IS ALL ABOUT THE PUNISHMENT FITTING THE CRIME. IT'S SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP TO IN THIS COUNTRY. WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE TO BECOME FREE WHO MAY HAVE SERVED ENOUGH OF THEIR TIME HAVE SERVED ENOUGH OF THEIR TIM TIME. MY MESSAGES I'M REALLY WANTING TO FIGHT HARD IN THIS WHOLE PRISON REFORM EFFORT. THAT IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT. I TELL ANYONE WHO IS FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES, DO NOT GIVE UP. YOU ALSO GET TO BE PREPARED IN CASE SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN, IN CASE THE MIRACLE DOES COME. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE READY TO REENTER SOCIETY AND I THANK GOD THAT IS WHAT I WAS ABLE TO DO TO REENTER SOCIETY AS A FREE WOMAN. Martha: IT'S SOMETHING THAT JARED KUSHNER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT AND KIM KARDASHIAN WHO CAME ON BOARD FOR YOU IN SUCH A BIG WAY AND THE PRESIDENT WANT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN FOR PEOPLE. WHAT YOUR MESSAGE FOR THEM TONIGHT? MY MESSAGE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LOOK AT MY CASE AND LOOK AT ME. I PROMISE YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP I WILL MAKE YOU PROUD THAT YOU GAVE ME THIS SECOND CHANCE. I TELL KIM, KEEP YOUR PASSION. I BELIEVE WHAT SHE SEES HAPPEN FOR ME HAS STIRRED SOMETHING MORE UP FOR HER AND SHE SAID ONE PERSON AT A TIME. Martha: YOU SAID ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHOCK TO THE MOST WHEN YOU GOT OUT IS HOW MUCH PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT THEIR PHONE. IT'S BEEN A BIG CHANGE SINCE YOU WERE AWAY. GOOD THING KIM KARDASHIAN WAS LOOKING AT HER PHONE, THAT'S HOW SHE FOUND YOU. THAT WAS EXACTLY HOW SHE FOUND ME. Martha: WE REALLY WISH YOU ALL THE BEST, THANK YOU SO MUCH
