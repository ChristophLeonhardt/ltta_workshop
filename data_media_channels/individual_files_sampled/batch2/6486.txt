one church in Pennsylvania wanted to celebrate ar-15s in this incredibly tumultuous time in America in regard to gun violence and so I wanted to share the images of this event with you it was essentially a commitment ceremony at this Pennsylvania Church the world peace and unification sanctuary and so people showed up to renew their vows and they were all not all but most we're carrying these weapons let's take a look at the pictures there's lots of fun going on over here wearing bullet crowns and essentially making the argument that guns or weapons like ar-15s have been given to the people by God and taking them away goes against their religious beliefs so The Associated Press reported on this they wrote that crown-wearing worshippers clutching ar-15s drank holy wine and exchanged or renewed wedding vows in a commitment ceremony at this Pennsylvania Church prompting a nearby school to cancel classes that school was actually concerned about the safety of the students they were worried the students were scared so they just decided to be safe and just close the school for that day the church which has a worldwide following believes that the ar-15 symbolizes the rod of iron in the book of Revelation and encourage couples to bring the weapon now there was a there was security there that checked the weapons to make sure they weren't loaded so according to the reports these these weapons were not loaded but there were protesters outside of the church one of those protesters was a woman who is not in favor of banning guns in fact she says that she herself has a gun however she says the following I don't need a freaking assault weapon to defend myself only thing they're good for is killing period that's all that weapon is good for mass killing and you want to bless it shame on you I like that they say no no they're not loaded dude the bullets are on your head I just saw the picture right in second oh do you trust these Lou tics that when they say I don't know we didn't load the weapons this is a wacky church to begin with they've done a lot of crazy things in the past and it is ironically called world peace and unification sanctuary not really a sanctuary I want to be in and only got a lot of peace there unless you're talking about pieces and a weapon they might want to change the spelling of the church and then on top of everything they're like okay we got a great idea everybody bring all of your assault weapons we'll get married or remarried with all this weaponry around nothing spells romance like renewing your vows with ar-15s and bullet crowns yes tears are so last year yes and on top of that we'll drink a lot of wine what could go wrong so to say it's a recipe for disaster is understating it if they got out of there without anybody getting shot and presumably they did they did thank God okay and maybe God's the only thing that saved him although I don't really believe that because just imagine for a second if anyone thought there was a shooting there I mean if someone came in and was a hostile actor everybody's getting killed because not only would there be the shooter but there'd be a hundred other people in the room shooting at the person they thought was the shooter and it'd be a massacre of epic proportions so I really do want to emphasize that the guns they were unloaded okay they say that I don't believe them at all they're lunatics I don't believe them they do these math ceremonies they sometimes in this church they make you get married to your to a spouse no I wouldn't either yeah so you have deeply unstable people who've just started decided that they're gonna be in what is borderline cult if I'm being kind and and then they tell you no don't worry in our cults when we bring all the weapons we generally don't load them you'll excuse me if I don't believe you besides which as I said the bullets are right around your frickin head can we go to the very first photo graphic 60 because I want to make a comment about that it's a woman holding her ar-15 in a very emotional way I looked at that image for a good 60 seconds full minute and and thought to myself is there anything any possession that I have that I love as much as that woman loves her ar-15 have I ever felt such deep emotion over an object and the only thing I could think of and I don't really consider it an object is my dog of course sure yeah like that's kind of the way I look at my dog but that's okay but I get it then a lot of people do that yeah but when you do that over a killing machine it's literally a tool to kill things efficiently and viciously it rips apart bodies it doesn't just put a hole through you if it if it hits one of your organs that organ explodes I mean it is I know it's a weapon of war and she's like holding it like she needs a different rod of iron oh and she's okay by the way one other thing I grew up going to Sunday school I'm no longer religious but one of the things that I remember in our Sunday School lessons was that as a Christian you're not supposed to worship anything other than God you see what I'm saying and so in these images you see these individuals who claim that their religious and it's you know part of their belief system and their values but they're worshipping a weapon they're worshipping you know inanimate object in an atom a table jekt so it's just it's all strange but this is American culture this is a slice of American culture no no so great point Ana the ar-15 has become their golden calf and and finally let's leave you with this idea imagine if there was a mosque in America where they all brought their ar-15 now picture Muslim dudes with a little skullcap and stuff and women wearing the hijab and they're all holding on to a ar-15s and saying uh and holding it like oh yeah yeah I can't wait to do something with this I mean JK imagine you forget America imagine if it was in Afghanistan they'd be like ah look at these barbarians bringing their weapons like this all and then everybody holds their even their women wearing the head job or perk or whatever holding these are 15s that would be like let's debate like they would have been looking what they're doing they're women look at what well how they are and etc let's let's go invade well I guess we're gonna have to invade Pennsylvania now you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
