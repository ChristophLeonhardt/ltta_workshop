“A well regulated Militia,”
“A well regulated Militia,”
“being necessary”
“to the security
of a free State”
“comma —”
“the right of the people”
“to keep and”
“bear arms”
“shall not be infringed.”
“shall not be infringed.”
“What exactly does that mean?”
So it’s only 27 words long,
but it is probably
the most cryptic part of the
United States Constitution.
It’s hard to know
what the connection is
between the two phrases
in the Second Amendment.
One of them seems to
announce a collective right
and the second
an individual one —
and knowing how
they are connected
is the key to
understanding
the Second Amendment.
If you read that
first clause by itself,
a well-regulated militia
is one that the government
has taken pains to control.
“American riflemen
are the best riflemen
in the world
because the
training they get
is the best in the world.”
You would think the
Second Amendment protects
a collective right to
keep and bear arms,
which is how
it was understood
for a long, long time in the
history of the United States.
The second clause cuts
in a different direction.
If you read this by itself,
it would seem to say
you have a personal
right to keep and bear arms.
However, when the
Constitution speaks
of the right of the
people, it sometimes
speaks in a more collective
sense rather than individual.
Let me discuss for a second
“to keep and bear arms.”
Most scholars agree
that to keep arms
is something you do
as an individual,
but to bear arms has
more of a military flavor.
What precisely the
framers meant by arms
is the subject of
a lot of dispute.
So the contemporary,
modern interpretation
of the Second Amendment
as protecting
an individual right
to keep and bear arms
is only 10 years old.
In that case, the
Supreme Court struck down
what was probably the
toughest gun control
law in the nation,
in Washington, D.C.
“We hold that the Second
Amendment guarantees
an individual right
to have and use arms
for self-defense
in the home.”
But it tells us
almost nothing
aside from “in the
home for self-defense.”
And since then,
the Supreme Court
has ducked case
after case after case
that could refine
and elaborate
the scope of the
Second Amendment
to tell us,
for instance,
is there a right to
bear arms in public?
Are concealed carry laws O.K.?
It’s told us almost nothing
about Second Amendment rights.
