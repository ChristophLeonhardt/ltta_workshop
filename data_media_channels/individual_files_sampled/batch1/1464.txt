Apple has long been criticized for its huge cash pile of some 250 billion dollars that it made through its foreign subsidiaries but refused to repatriate to the US in order to avoid paying US taxes that's 94 percent of its total cash under the new tax bill passed at the end of last year Apple and other multinationals got what they long wanted a reduction in the tax rate on those holdings from 38 percent to 15 and a half percent however Apple has to pay that fifteen and a half percent whether it Repat raise the money or not on Wednesday Apple announced its tax bill will come to 38 billion dollars a saving of some forty two billion dollars according to analysts the company also announced it will open a new campus in the u.s. hire 20,000 more employees and spend 350 billion dollars over the next five years this is really good for Apple's PR without a doubt they're talking about an Innovation Fund jobs money back in the the pockets of their employees and money being repatriated so this is a win-win all around however it's not clear whether the expansion plans are new and Apple hasn't announced any changes to its manufacturing model which is based around Asian factories nor is it clear how much of its money it plans to repatriate at all analysts say much of any repatriated money may go to paying down the ninety seven billion dollars in debt that it incurred as it rewarded its shareholders in stock buybacks and dividends and in giving its shareholders even more billions of dollars and that could spark controversy without the announcement of the new campus and more job creation in the US but as for those jobs at the new campus many will be in technical support no location has yet been announced but according to reports they will be paid an average of $36,000 a year other investments will be in expanded data centers around the u.s. warehouses for equipment this is an announcement it's sure to be capitalized on by President Trump who criticized the company during the presidential election campaign and on Wednesday the Dow Jones had 26,000 points for the first time an indicator that the president is used to suggest a booming economy Apple's shares also hit a record close price so it seems like president Trump's plan is working as he laid it out tax reform tax cuts he wanted seemed to be taking effect in a very meaningful way in that jobs are gonna be coming back overseas and most importantly money that's been overseas is coming back but the main beneficiaries off the Dow's rally and apple's announcement will be the minority of Americans already raking in the cash from their stock market investments she averaged hansi Al Jazeera
