PRETTY INTERESTING, ADD. I A FEELING. RIGHT ON THE HEELS OF CRITICISM OF THE G.O.P. IS GETTING RUN OVER IN THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS, SENATE JUDICIARY CHAIR CHUCK GRASSLEY HAS DRAWN A LINE IN THE SAND, HEARING THURSDAY AND OF THE COMMITTEES ARE TO COME A VOTE ON FRIDAY, PUTTING A FLOOR VOTE ON KAVANAUGH ON TRACK FOR NEXT WEEK. LET'S BRING IN THE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESPERSON. GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK WITH US. THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON ME ON. Shannon: I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING OF THE PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE SECOND ACCUSER WHO CAME FORWARD TO TALK ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT REACTIONS. IT MAY NOT BE HIM, THERE WERE GAPS, SHE SAID SHE WAS TOTALLY INEBRIATED, AND SHE WAS ALL MESSED UP, AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT WAS HIM BUT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIM. OH, GEE, LET'S NOT MAKE IT MAY SUPREME COURT JUDGE. Shannon: A COUPLE OF WOMEN'S GROUPS, PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND NARAL, THEY SAY "STATEMENTS LIKE THIS WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ARE DANGEROUS AND IRRESPONSIBLE. NARAL SANK DONALD TRUMP'S ATTACKS ON MS. RAMIREZ ARE DISGUSTING AND COWARDLY. HE'S BEEN VERY DISCIPLINED ON TALKING ABOUT THESE ACCUSERS. TODAY IT SEEMS LIKE HE WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE FORCEFUL IN WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE REACTIONS? I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BECAUSE THOSE STATEMENTS ARE FROM MS. RAMIREZ HERSELF. SHE HERSELF SAID THAT SHE WAS SO INEBRIATED THAT SHE WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR IN A FOG, SLURRING HER WORDS, IT TOOK HER SIX DAYS WORKING WITH ATTORNEYS TO EVEN REMEMBER THIS ALLEGED INCIDENT. SHE ADMITS THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN THE STORY. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED THAT MS. RAMIREZ WAS CALLING HER YALE CLASSMATES TO SEE IF THEY REMEMBER THE INCIDENT. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REFUSED TO RUN THE STORY BECAUSE THEY "CALLED DOZENS" OF PEOPLE TO ATTEMPT TO CORROBORATE THE STORY, UNLIKE THE NEW YORKER, AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO DO IT BY "THE NEW YORK TIMES" WOULD ENTHRONE THE STORY. PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS JUST REPEATING WHAT MS. RAMIREZ SAID ABOUT HERSELF. Shannon: WHAT ABOUT CONTINUED CALLS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TO AUTHORIZE OR ASK RASPY FBI TO GO AHEAD AND DO AN ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION INTO THESE THINGS? PEOPLE ARE POINTING BACK TO THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE DURING THE ANITA HILL, CLARENCE THOMAS HEARINGS, SAYING THEY ASKED FOR A HEARING AND TO THAT POINT, "THE WASHINGTON POST" HAD A PIECE OUT, "AS FOR KAVANAUGH, HE MIGHT ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM AN FBI INVESTIGATION. WITHOUT ONE, HE WILL ALWAYS HAVE A CLOUD OVER HIS HEAD." THEY WENT OUT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE COULD BENEFIT AND CLEAR HIS OWN NAME IF THEY HAD AN INDEPENDENT BODY LIKE THE FBI LOOK INTO THIS. WHILE THE WHITE HOUSE CHANGE POSITION ON THAT? I WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE JOE BIDEN ON THIS ONE. LET'S GO BACK TO 1991 WHERE HE VERY FORCEFULLY TOLD CLARENCE THOMAS, WHO IS IN A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, THAT FBI CLEARANCE AND BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THEY ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE. THEY PRESENT WHAT HE SAID, WHAT SHE SAID, AND THAT IS AT. THAT IS WHAT THE FBI HAS DONE HERE. IN FACT THEY HAVE CONDUCTED SIX INVESTIGATIONS, SIX CLEARANCES, SIX BACKGROUND CHECKS ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH SINCE 1993. THAT COVERED HIS TIME AT YALE, THIS ALLEGATION EVER EMERGED. THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS DOING THEIR JOB. THEY ARE HOLDING THIS HEARING. THEY WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. JUDGE KAVANAUGH, AS HE HAS REPEATEDLY STATED, IS ANXIOUS TO CLEAR HIS NAME, WHICH IS WHY HE EVEN CONDUCTED AN INTERVIEW JUST TODAY WITH THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE UNDER PENALTY UNDER OATH WHICH IS A SUBJECT OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES IF HE WAS LYING. HE EMPHATICALLY TOLD THEM THAT HE DID NOT DO WHAT MS. RAMIREZ IS ALLEGING THAT HE DID. Shannon: OF COURSE HE DID A PUBLIC INTERVIEW WITH MARTHA MacCALLUM, PLAYED A LOT OF THAT LESSON INTELLECTUAL. THE AP REACTION SAYS AFTER THE INTERVIEW AIRED, THE SENSE OF THE WEST WING WAS RELIEVED THAT KAVANAUGH WAS ABLE TO PRESENT AN IMAGE TO COUNTER THE ALLEGATION ALLEGATIONS. YET THEY WERE CONCERNS AMONG AIDES AND TRUMP ABOUT HOW KAVANAUGH WOULD HOLD UP FACING FIERCER QUESTIONING FROM DEMOCRATS. WE IMAGINE IT WILL GET FEISTY. ANY ADVICE OR TAKE IT WAS HER LAST NIGHT AS HE PREPS FOR THURSDAY? I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE COMFORT IN THE MANY, MANY PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE COME OUT IT ON HIS BEHALF. THERE WAS A PRESS CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., A FEW DAYS AGO WHERE CLOSE TO 100 WOMEN WHO PERSONALLY KNOW JUDGE KAVANAUGH SPOKE TO HIS INCREDIBLE TREATMENT OF WOMEN. THIS INCLUDED PAST HIGH SCHOOL GIRLFRIENDS, THIS INCLUDED FORMER STAFF, FORMER COLLEAGUES, THERE ARE SO MANY LETTERS SUBMITTED TO THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON HIS BEHALF FROM THESE WOMEN AND SO MANY OTHERS. THIS IS A MAN WHO WAS WELL LOVED BY SO MANY. HE HAS IMPECCABLE CREDENTIALS, HE IS AN INCREDIBLE REPUTATION, AND I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE QUALIFIED HUMAN BEING TO BE OUR NEXT SUPREME COURT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. Shannon: THE PUBLIC WILL GET A LOOK AT BOTH HE AND DR. DR. FORD ON THURSDAY IF SHE
