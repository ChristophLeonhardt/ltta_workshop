Iran has a much more sinister reason for wanting Syria and that's - that's to really be on Israel's doorstep and be able to try a decayed Israel right I mean it's so this is a really dangerous collaboration here well I can I can see why why Iran would push Assad to do this I think Iran pushes Assad to do this hoping that we and the Israelis take Assad out and Iran gets to fill that power vacuum but what do you think might irritate in Iraq like they did in Iraq exactly what do you think of my mic here though that Russia wouldn't let Iran take that that Russia would step in and say okay you did the dirty work no no we're taking over see right exactly the there would be definitely be a big power struggle right now right now you've got some kind of unprecedented stuff going on behind the scenes diplomatically you've got Russia and Iran and Turkey talking all of these guys are literally all of them are traditional foes of one another right but there were kind of united in their antipathy toward the United States at this point so if they're dealing with each other but they don't fully trust one another now it right certainly if if Assad collapsed then you see the Russians and the Iranians working out working each other over but right now they are sort of cooperating now I can also understand the Israeli strike yesterday because that was basically directed against you know in Iranian encampment of Iranian of Islamic Revolutionary Guard I mean these are the same guys like that killed more than a thousand of our of our troops in Iraq in Iraq and you raise a great point I mean this was really Iraq the endgame in Iraq as well right we ransoms in the Revolutionary the guard they start engaging with our troops the goal is always to take out the US and Israel we take Saddam Hussein out of a hole we create a power vacuum iran backed insurgents move in and iran essentially then control Iraq a country they've been worrying with without ever firing a shot against the Iraqis that's right they're their enemy's enemy was their friend I don't think is rolling far enough you know that would I don't like Scott is that Israel he here's another thing that is bothering me to no end you've got the global media blaming Israel saying Israel to be blamed for launching these strikes blaming Israel then you've got these morons on the all Talt right saying this was an Israeli false flag to draw the US and a war I mean these people are clueless with what Israel as a nation deals with every single day number one is back is against the wall they're not gonna have a lot of extra time right things like you know false flag operations like this one I mean you know that these you know I'll take the IRGC IRGC the Iranians SS basically at their word you know they're evil dudes and you know I can understand the Israeli Israelis for wanting to take them out it's all really important content especially Syria and really calling out liberal hypocrisy especially in the media especially in the media flow of information and I want to be able to bring it to you every single day help me do that by subscribing we're a premium service that wwww forward slash shows you're already a subscriber thank you very very much
