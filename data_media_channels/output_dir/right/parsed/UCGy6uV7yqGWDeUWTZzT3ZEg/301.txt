I am more than comfortable that doing
what we've done accepting in 25,000
Syrian refugees does right by both the
safety of Canadians and by the values
that define us as a nation would you be
just as comfortable if there was a
terrorist attack carried out by someone
who came through as a refugee ultimately
being open and respectful towards each
other is much more powerful as a way to
defuse hatred and anger then you know
layering on you know big walls and
oppressive policies
some people say that if it hadn't been
for the surge in Syrian refugees after
the 2015 election guys like this guy
would not be here
I'm not one of those people mr. al I've
got terminated at its of years old and
where's the leader we are here yes we
demand prime minister to approach
