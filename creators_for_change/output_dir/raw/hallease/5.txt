1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,730
(train engine blaring)

2
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,177
(train clacking)

3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,004
- This is Uncomfortable.

4
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:30,587
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,850
On the exterior, I know I seem fine.

6
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,893
I wake up, I work, I don't raise my voice.

7
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,990
The shift has been subtle,

8
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,393
and I see it most in my relationships.

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,720
People I once felt a
strong connection with

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,660
are falling out of my life.

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,920
The energy I once had to
entertain is now gone.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,690
All that is left is who I am at my core.

13
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,140
So most of my days I spend here

14
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,010
at the co-working space
that I work out of.

15
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,230
And I do that so that way
I can be amongst people,

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,140
if you will.

17
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,220
A lot of this work I like very solitary

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,910
and this is kind of the only way

19
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,535
that I'll be able to see anyone. (laughs)

20
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:26,200
But I'm kind of weird
in that I don't really

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,240
want to talk to anybody,
but I definitely get lonely.

22
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,220
So it's this weird balance of
wanting to be amongst people,

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,860
but not necessarily engage with people.

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,890
Being a video producer and
then just creating in general,

25
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,800
it's a very solitary job.

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,720
And that's not a bad thing,
but it makes it hard.

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,640
Other people have a
hard time understanding

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,670
why you are the way you are

29
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,310
or why you limit your
interactions the way you do

30
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,210
because you gotta focus a
lot and push other things

31
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,660
aside a lot to achieve
what you wanna achieve.

32
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,070
I'm still working through that balance.

33
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:13,010
I understand now why so many
people that get into this

34
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,120
talk about being lonely.

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,190
And then also end up
surrounding themselves

36
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,140
with other creators, other
people that are doing the same

37
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,000
thing so they understand
that like you're not

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,310
blowing 'em off, you're
just getting work done,

39
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,310
or just knowing when exactly
how to check in with you

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,183
and stuff like that.

41
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,980
I really appreciate the
other creators that I've met

42
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,873
that understand this process.

43
00:02:39,873 --> 00:02:42,456
(upbeat music)

44
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,280
Over the years I've
learned the subtle cues.

45
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,660
How to adjust myself, my body, my voice

46
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,383
to ease any tension in a room.

47
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,950
I've learned all too
well how to be whatever

48
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,273
someone needs me to be for a time.

49
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,810
Sometimes to play the corporate game,

50
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,233
or to protect my life.

51
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,770
We all learn how to not be abrasive.

52
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,970
But with this inner conflict,
with this lack of comfort

53
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,090
that I now have, that energy is gone

54
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,110
and all that is left is Hallease.

55
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,933
Raw and unfiltered, impatient, and unkind.

56
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,893
But apparently this shift,
this lack of comfort is normal.

57
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,310
- Yeah, it's just like one of those things

58
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,253
where you don't recognize how much,

59
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,550
how much when people say
blood, sweat, and tears,

60
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,171
you think that they're exaggerating.

61
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:49,910
I don't know, when I,

62
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,888
I was like oh my god, I
have a business y'all.

63
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:57,040
It was very like hehe,
like cute, you don't know

64
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,430
all that goes into it.

65
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,430
And then you start doing
it and you love it,

66
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,003
but there are moments where
you're like, what the,

67
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,620
what did I get myself into.

68
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,040
And then of course,
someone explained it to me

69
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,990
like the lows are lows, so low.

70
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,570
So crushingly low.

71
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,610
But the highs are just like you can't,

72
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,350
there's nothing that compares to it

73
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,050
when it's just like, it's
like I think it's probably

74
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,742
when parents see their
kids doing really well.

75
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:30,210
It's like yeah.

76
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,310
It's that feeling of accomplishment,

77
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,660
feeling of purpose, like
that fulfillment of purpose,

78
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,140
and it's really amazing.

79
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,140
But it's difficult because
it can be very, very lonely.

80
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,900
- So how have your relationships changed,

81
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,000
as a business owner?

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,863
- I think because I'm an Army brat,

83
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,643
I've always been,

84
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,130
I've always been okay with oh
I'll see you when I see you.

85
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,930
I never, that's because
that's how I grew up.

86
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,850
- [Hallease] Yeah, me too.

87
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,478
- Yeah, we're just like okay.

88
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:09,106
- [Hallease] That's
literally my end slogan.

89
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:11,650
- [Both Women] I'll
see you when I see you.

90
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,160
- Like you know, like I love you,

91
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,490
please know that me not
seeing you like once a week

92
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,053
does not mean that I don't
care or anything like that.

93
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,500
But it wasn't really until
college where I realized,

94
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,560
like oh, some people are used
to just like seeing somebody

95
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,393
all the time.

96
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:32,580
Like in high school, I used to tell people

97
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,260
like the last day of
school, I'll holler at y'all

98
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,730
day one of class, this
is my vacation from you.

99
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,050
So like I've always
been the type of person

100
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,970
where like I'm, like I still love you,

101
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,650
but you know, I'll be okay.

102
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,650
But being an entrepreneur has kind of

103
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,260
heightened that, and I don't know if it's

104
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,580
just because of adulthood
where it's just like

105
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,540
this natural progression of

106
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,400
everybody kind of solidifying
where they're going in life

107
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,160
and naturally your circle of
people that you're closest to

108
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,040
like surrounds that.

109
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,990
So I've made a lot of
friends who are either

110
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,940
creatives or entrepreneurs
in some type of way.

111
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,167
Who is just like we're cool.

112
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,700
- [Hallease] We're cool
not seeing each other.

113
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,140
- We're like, 'cause know that
we're doing things, right,

114
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,733
but then for friends that are in more,

115
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,770
who aren't self-employed
or small business owners,

116
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,223
or artists, creatives in
any way, professionally,

117
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,440
there's a structure
that just doesn't exist

118
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,140
when you're doing it yourself.

119
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,810
- Yeah, I mean I'm definitely,
I'm definitely like

120
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,210
a and I see you when I see
you type of person, for sure.

121
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,190
And that's the other thing too,

122
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,560
I feel like the only reason I even see you

123
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,830
when I see you is 'cause
we both work from here.

124
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,426
- [Jordan] That's true, that's true.

125
00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:58,259
- 'Cause that's the other thing too,

126
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,720
I feel like a lot of people forget,

127
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,520
you can be a villain in someone's life.

128
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,540
Everyone talks about
toxicity in terms of like,

129
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,630
oh, you know, cut out toxic
people from your life,

130
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,463
blah, blah, blah.

131
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:12,340
And so also I was like, always
wanna remind people too,

132
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,822
and you can be toxic to somebody.

133
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:14,660
I feel like--

134
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,492
- Be that toxic person.
- Yeah!

135
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:19,410
- [Jordan] You might get cut
out, be like wait, hold on.

136
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,623
- Hold up a minute!

137
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:22,730
- And that's hard too.
- That's hard to take in,

138
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,260
but hey, if I'm toxic, you
need to drop me, drop me.

139
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,600
- [Jordan] But at the same time.

140
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,286
- It hurts though.

141
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:31,210
(horn blaring)

142
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,940
So what do I do now?

143
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,880
As I watch the life I knew go
loudly crashing into the grave

144
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,560
and I move forward on this sturdy

145
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,940
but narrow path without it.

146
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,783
What do I do?

147
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,680
I guess I gotta do what
I do best and adapt

148
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,000
and get comfortable with
being uncomfortable.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(jazzy music)
