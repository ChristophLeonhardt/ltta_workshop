his truck and I didn't film it I'm
stubborn
so if you've ever wanted to know how to
flip over a monster truck this is how
case you have one of your house
okay so during the show I asked you guys
to tweet Monster Jam to let us go
backstage and see the trucks everybody's
gone and they just tweeted me that
they're coming to meet us they're
probably pranking me the other never
again stuff up so thank you guys it was
all because of your tweets you guys
smashed the Twitter so so this lovely
lady named Sam Sam is escorting us do
this Scooby Doo corridors and we're
gonna go see the trucks good I bet
they're way bigger when you get down
there huh
nobody far very very careful because the
trucks when you when they are looking
out feet they can only see
okay thank you guys it's awesome
they're definitely bigger when you get
down here
biggest sucker is did these are massive
what's up man how are you I'm roaming
out what nice to meet you just the
announcer the show right here what's
your name man my name is Greg Whitaker
Greg Whitaker is out there he's out
there doing his thing and I know look at
that

all tire is almost
yeah I did just moments ago that sucker
was hopping in midair
it's like they're rebuilding the track
because tomorrow they're gonna do it
again nice to meet you bro hey I see
you're working on the truck we got a
Roman soldier working on the truck drive
this thing yeah I want to drive it I
said how do I Drive one of these so fine
if I come to you I can drive this like
gentle yeah I got a serious question how
often you change the tires on this thing
tires come off every time we move the
truck but like replacement I'm often you
replace them like completely it all
depends on how often they get done these
terms are actually pretty strong they're
ten flat tires and they can put up a lot
of abuse yeah that's amazing
these guys are animals right here man
