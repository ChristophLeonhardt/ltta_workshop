1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,080
Sometimes it’s impossible to separate the
company from the founder.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,580
Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,010
Steve Jobs and Apple.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,280
Elon Musk and Tesla.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,880
And for better or worse…

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,289
ERIC NEWCOMER: It’s hard thinking about
Uber without thinking about Travis Kalanick.

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,630
ERIC: But...that’s not always a good thing.

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,850
That’s Eric Newcomer.

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,410
ERIC: I cover Uber and startups for Bloomberg.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:29,420
Kalanick has become a lightning rod of controversy
in the tech industry over the past few years.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,560
And Seth Meyer's says he's what happens when you...

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,000
SETH MEYERS: spray Axe body spray into a suit until it became sentient.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,250
And after a number of damaging scandals, Kalanick
resigned as CEO from his  69

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,000
billion dollar brainchild.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,769
This is the story of how Travis Kalanick built
one of the most successful -- and controversial

16
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,809
-- tech companies in the world.

17
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:53,160
Travis Kalanick was born in 1976 in Los Angeles.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,210
He went to UCLA to study engineering, and
started his first company with some classmates,

19
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:05,730
an online file exchange service called Scour,
Months before graduating, he dropped out to

20
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,079
work on Scour full time.

21
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:13,020
ERIC: It was back in sort of the Napster days,
and it was sort of a failed effort.

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,429
Scour ended up getting sued by almost every
major entertainment label to the tune of 250

23
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:19,429
billion dollars.

24
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:21,429
--and Kalanick was forced to take the firm
into Chapter 11

25
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,579
Undaunted, Kalanick started another company.

26
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,600
ERIC: called Redwoosh, another peer-to-peer
file sharing service.

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,819
Which got bought out for $19 million by a
company called Akamai.

28
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:33,079
A cloud computing services company.

29
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,640
ERIC: But for Travis, he never built the empire
that he’d hoped to.

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,430
Flush with cash after selling Redswoosh, Kalanick
was looking to make his next move.

31
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,779
The story goes he was in Paris with his friend
Garrett Camp, who had founded the social site

32
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:49,090
StumbleUpon, and they started talking about...

33
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,869
ERIC: The idea of calling a car with the push
of a button.

34
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:57,539
He came back to San Francisco and started
Uber in 2009, and it was originally thought

35
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:58,579
of as a luxury service.

36
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:00,779
ERIC: And it was a black car business.

37
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:08,340
It wasn’t a peer-to-peer thing, it was meant
to get a nice car.

38
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,590
But when its main competitor entered the marketplace
in 2012, Uber had to pivot.

39
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,780
ERIC: Once it was obvious that Lyft was going
to be successful and be able to do this peer-to-peer

40
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,820
ride-sharing business, he was savvy enough
to launch his own products.

41
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,879
So Kalanick, well known as an extremely strong
salesperson, raised a huge amount of money…

42
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,859
ERIC: They raised you know hundreds of millions
from a round of Google Ventures and TPG.

43
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:35,530
And created Uber X.

44
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,599
ERIC: Which was really the defining product.

45
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,280
Which basically lets anyone sign up to be
a driver without having to have been this

46
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,689
legacy black car worker.

47
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:48,719
Almost singlehandedly, Kalanick created what
we now call “the gig economy.”

48
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,170
Paying independent contractors through an
app for a service, whether it’s cleaning

49
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,799
a home, delivering food, or being a chauffeur.

50
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:01,000
ERIC: Even though the company is 12,000 people
now, he very much has a reputation for trying

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,090
to cut through bureaucracy and keep it like
a start-up.

52
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,980
But Kalanick has also been criticized for
a number of incidents.

53
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,870
ERIC: The ‘Boober” incident comes up so
often.

54
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,569
In a 2014 GQ profile of Kalanick he referred
to his company as “Boob-er” because of

55
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,930
his increased success with women AS
the CEO of Uber.

56
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,749
Then the PR missteps kept coming.

57
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:27,800
In just the first 3 months of 2017 alone there
were enough gaffes, leaked videos, and negative

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,360
headlines that could easily sink a company.

59
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,940
Kalanick: You blame everything in your life on somebody else!

60
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,860
ERIC: There’s this constant clamor for him
to grow up.

61
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,010
The company is sort of in the middle of trying
to decide whether he can really be their identity

62
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,450
both publicly and internally.

63
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,889
In February of 2017, the board hired former
Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate

64
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:55,879
the company following a bombshell blogpost
from a former Uber employee accusing the company

65
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,200
of systemic sexual misconduct.

66
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,340
Several days after Uber released the 13-page
report, Kalanick announced he would be taking

67
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,340
a leave of absence.

68
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,310
A week later, he resigned as CEO.

69
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,600
So while the question used to be 'Who will Kalanick hire as his number 2?"

70
00:04:11,740 --> 00:00:00,000
The question now is how will the company successfully navigate the post-Kalanick era?
