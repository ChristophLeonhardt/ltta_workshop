A FULL RECOVERY SO SHE CAN
CONTINUE HER WORK ON BEHALF OF
CHILDREN EVERYWHERE.
THAT'S THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT
FROM THE FIRST LADY'S OFFICE.
DR. SEAGLE IS ON THE LINE WITH
US, A MEMBER OF THE FOX NEWS
MEDICAL A TEAM.
DR. SEAGLE, THIS WAS KEPT UNDER
WRAPS, PRIVACY AS IS SOMEWHAT
STANDARD.
I'M SURE THIS IS A MATTER THAT A
LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE GOOGLING.
A GOOD MOMENT FOR US TO LEARN
MORE ABOUT IT.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US,
DR. SEAGLE?
>> SHEP, LISTEN, THE FIRST THING
IS THAT THIS TYPE OF A THING --
I DON'T HAVE THE INSIDE MEDICAL
INFORMATION.
COMMONLY IT'S SOMETHING CALLED A
FATTY TUMOR, WHICH IS BENIGN.
THERE'S TWO WAYS YOU CAN REMOVE
IT.
ONE IS TO REMOVE IT SURGICALLY.
THE OTHER IS TO BLOOD OFF THE
BLOOD SUPPLY.
IT'S A GOOD TIME TO UNDERSTAND
THAT WE HAVE ADVANCED WITH
MODERN SURGICAL TECHNIQUES WHERE
WE CAN ISOLATE AND CUT OFF THE
BLOOD SUPPLY TO SOMETHING THAT
IS BENIGN AND SHRINK IT SO YOU
DON'T HAVE TO REMOVE IT
SURGICALLY.
>> Shepard: WHAT IS SHE
UNDERGOING RIGHT NOW?
>> A LITTLE PAIN IN THE AREA,
SOME DISCOVERED.
A LOT LESS IF YOU REMOVED IT
SURGICALLY.
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.
YOU GO IN THROUGH AN ARTERY AND
A SMALL INCISION.
CATHETER, ARTERY.
NOT A LOT OF PAIN.
RAPID RECOVERY.
>> Shepard: THE NEXT FEW DAYS,
WILL THE PAIN DIMINISH?
ARE THERE THINGS A DOCTOR WOULD
TELL HER TO DO OR NOT DO?
>> THEY'LL OF COURSE BE WATCHING
HER URINE.
THEY'LL WATCH THE AREA WHERE THE
THEY'LL TELL HER NOT TO DO A LOT
HOFF EXTENSIVE ACTIVITY.
TAKE IT EASY.
SHE PROBABLY WANT HAVE MORE THAN
A DAY OR SO OF BED REST.
PROBABLY WILL SEE HER BACK ON
HER FEET IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.
A MODERN MIRACLE OF A
NONSURGICAL APPROACH.
>> Shepard: DR. SEAGLE -- PLEASE
FINISH.
>> SHEP, WE CALL IT MINIMALLY
INNOVATIVE NOW.
AGAIN, YOU USE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO SHRINK THE BLOOD SUPPLY TO
SOMETHING THAT IS BENIGN.
YOU WOULDN'T USE THIS TECHNIQUE
IF YOU THOUGHT THERE WAS A
CHANCE IT WAS MALIGNANT.
SOMETHING LIKE A FATTY TUMOR,
YOU CAN DO THIS.
IT REQUIRES A LOT OF BLOOD.
YOU CUT OFF THE BLOOD AND IT
SHRINKS.
>> Shepard: THE FIRST LADY LOOKS
