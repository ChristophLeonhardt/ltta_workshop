I am Alika Bilal I'm Ahmed sub-dean and you're in the stream today we'll hear from an artist who's mixing hip hop with the history of indigenous America Native American artist Frank Wong joins us to share his latest music and if you're new to the concept of indigenous hip hop then have a listen to this never seen storm and the original flotation well I can't break you come on that's right get the legacy of broken treaties colonialism and Native American genocide are constant themes in Frank Wong's music born in the Rosebud Indian Reservation in rural South Dakota Wong uses music to call out historical wrongs and uplift indigenous youth many of whom struggle from the impacts of poverty violence suicide and other intergenerational traumas so joining us now is Franklin here in the studio welcome to the stream Frank hello Mike it's an honor to be here it's really good to have you here so you know this past week our team and I have been going through your music it has been lovely homework to have and we came up with some themes that we thought we found most prevalent in your work and that is history heritage and family that to us is what seems to be the drivers behind your work for you what is it that drives your music I mean I think you guys kind of hit it on the head I tried to approach my work from an indigenous standpoint and that's not to say I have all the answers like I grew up and I said the colony in my mind was socialized into you know the Western way of looking at the world so as I get more in touch with my own calls during my own roots and try to uncover what they took from us I try to bring that out in my work so very much at the core of it is love love for my people for the land for my family love for everything that we're supposed to live in balance with it's interesting to hear you say that a lot of people commenting on settler colonialism and kind of the courage the creative courage in your lyrics specifically John little on Twitter pointing at one song in particular called what makes the red man red saying my favorite line from his music is quote you inherited everything we died for and all we get is a goddamn mascot so since that person brought up a song that you know I want to hear your answer on that and what you think of that I want to share our audience share with our audience what it sounds like so have a listen to this on SoundCloud SoundCloud what made the red man red so you sampled a Disney song it was from the animated feature the 1953 animated movie Peter Pan right and turned it on its head so tell us about that so I produce my own music and I that was the first time I ever actually sampled a vinyl I found that record in a children's bin and used vinyl slaughter in Minneapolis for $1 and I've always wanted to do something with that song just because Disney has a pretty horrible history of stereotyping my people and it's there in the music and so I always look for creative ways to put things like that on their head like and I just want to point out that a song was full of racial slurs for indigenous people but it came off of a children's record and you know so I just by doing that alone it kind of shows you where we're at in this country as far as how we look at and treat indigenous people you have this line in there where you say what made you think the red man was dead or someone paraphrasing a little bit and I know you have a story where that actually happened to you someone someone is surprised yeah so it was my first weekend so I graduated from Columbia College in Chicago I got my Bachelor of Arts and yeah audio arts and acoustics and the first week I was there I was living in a dorm room I know dorm building in downtown Chicago and I got in the elevator and this girl got on the elevator with me and she was not native she commented on my hair she's like you've really pretty hair what are you I was like you know thank you I'm Lakota and she didn't know what that meant and so I had to be more general and I was like I'm Native American and she looked at me confused and she was like you guys are still alive you know I just think about that we got college educated adults living on stolen colonize land I think we don't even exist anymore Wow yeah I mean your people are talking about the reservations people you're saying you know people think we don't even exist anymore so much of your culture sadly for better or worse is out of sight and kind of out of mind a lot of people touching on that online for example we have Lakota men on Twitter saying I currently reside in LA our obstacles when talking about you know he tweeted us saying obstacles you face on reservation other than deeply entrenched institutional racism and post genocide all PTSD he goes on and on and says there's so much hopelessness how do you change that sense of hopelessness into hope and your music or do you I think I think you know I've been thinking about that a lot lately because I grew up in a place where it was it's it can get hopeless and I think when you're survivors of a genocide where less than 1% of your people survived and you never been able to heal there's gonna be a lot like you said you know like a colonial PTSD a lot of hopelessness so I think for me my work becomes a tool for me to practice hope is almost a mantra almost like a daily practice you know you know you got to keep practicing that hope on a daily basis otherwise it's easy to lose hope in that goal so I think my music gives me the tool to practice it in a day to day basis what drew you to hip-hop in the first place the storytelling the the drums the the truth speaking truth to power you know I think at its core hip-hop was created by colonized people who were stolen away from their homeland and stolen away from their culture and trying to recreate something that was taken from them so I think hip-hop at its core is coming from indigenous roots you know African folks were where indigenous people as well we all are Colin nice people so I think that's why as an indigenous person I resonate with it because it was created by colonized people and it's drawing from indigenous tradition that his roots you know Frank for as much as we all love hip-hop and I think we all here do love hip-hop but some people don't love hip-hop but they still love you M&E loves jaisingh on Twitter I'm not a fan of hip-hop but it's different with his music really great I love it too bad I live so far to ever see him live she goes on then to say when we asked what do you think is different about his music she said good question it might be because he talks about the realities that the government tried so hard to erase it's important to keep talking and spread the word to those who do not know and you're doing it extremely well are you conscious of that that you're educating as much as you're entertaining you know in the beginning I wasn't because I was just you know one thing I was taught from others in my community is that if you know something you do it without being asked and if you if you learn something you repeat it so others can learn it and so I think you know I just was talking about those things because it's my life that history isn't engrained in my life indigenous people our lives are politicized whether we want it to be or not because our reality was influenced by the US policy and still is today so I would be lying if I wasn't talking about my reality in my life you know so it just it just started happening and then as I started putting up the music I realized there was a need to educate not only non natives but my own people because we were cut off from that history as well I didn't know I was I came from a colonized nation until I was in my twenties you know yeah that's wild well in the spirit of Education Frank I know you're gonna perform a new song for us it's called my people come from the land so as you get ready I wanted to share this video comment that came from Nolan hack talking kind of about what we just spoke of Frank wall and his music speak to me because he is uncompromising and his music is uncompromising he tells the truth his music tells the truth and that I can identify with that as a black man because I look at something like this is America by Donald Glover and it's that it's the same thing Donald comes out and goes hey this is what this is what this country has been doing to us but so long this is what this country is still doing to us right now Frank's laying it on the table the same way coming out with Aboriginal coming out with what makes a red man red and saying hey this is what this country has been doing to Native people for 100 years this is what this country is still doing today people come from the land my people come from the land on which you stand still fighting the white man's to fight the way birth of a rebel rebel my nation living in peril with several flows I'm armwrestling with white Devils to share Bo but never settle said the lane on my bevel give you base give me treble i'm trouble but never Trimble weakened over seven council fires keepers of the flame

in the way Gorge it courgette so so powerful Wow you are watching the stream with the hip-hop indigenous artists Frank Wong and that was one of his latest songs that previewing here on the stream for the very first time so we're quite privileged our followers online know that we're privileged here this is one person on Twitter who says so happy to be watching this live stream with Frank wall and someone else on YouTube watching live says I love this the history of Native Americans is so important and needs to be taught and retained that's Ilana S on Facebook and it's interesting what she says the history needs to be taught it needs to be retained because your line of the song is my people come from the land and you talk about historical tragedies of the white man but they're still ongoing today do you think enough people understand that honestly I think not and I think you know what people's reactions so what's happening right now at the border is a great example of that if you understood this history from a settler colonial lands you understand this history has are this country has a deep history of separating indigenous children from their parents I mean the same thing happened to my great-grandparents they were snatched up and taken to boarding school and so you know what's happening today is just a continuation of one of the founding pillars this country was built on just just to posi there just because I know some people in our audience may not be familiar with boarding schools some might think that sounds like a good thing yeah but these were indoctrination yeah yeah yeah so I'm getting boarding schools in this country and this happened to my great-grandparents they came into our homes under you know under orders of the US government and snatched up all of our children from the u.s. up to Canada and they they took my great-grandparents from home and I don't know what happened to them but I know that they never spoke our language again and never passed on any of our culture after that so I can't imagine you what you would have to do to a small child to make them stop speaking their language and I didn't even know my great-grandparents were in our language until they were after they were passed on and I was in my 20s because they kept it that much of a secret they felt that being native was something to be ashamed of because these schools taught all of our ancestors that and this country is built on the dehumanization of indigenous people you know and that in Indian boarding schools are one of those tactics that used you know when you talk about the dehumanization whether it's Native Americans and you know language and land and these symbols your message is obviously resonating thick shady on Twitter on Twitter saying is such an extraordinary musician talking about you of course his lyrics have the strength to render the overarching American culture speechless however I think creating music by native people for Native people in presenting a positive native figure is more important to him in his music you smile as I kind of finished that tweet why is that as alright I think it's cool whenever my fans kind of you know because the people who follow my work are usually hardcore fans because I don't got you know there's not a lot of it's hard being an indigenous person and indigenous artist speaking about these things trying to make it in a in an entertainment system built in a in a settler colony built on the dehumanization of your people you know it'd be like saying um well as a Palestinian rapper talking about Israel gonna make it in an Israeli record label are they're gonna get promoted in Israel not really you know and it's the same thing with us here um it's hard to you know break through to the popular American culture as an indigenous artists speaking on these sorts of things so I smile because you know the people that follow me get it and it I just smiled because you know she hit it right on there follow him from all over the world because you brought up Palestine I just quickly want to bring their voice into this conversation because I know you recently took a trip there we also have Palestinian fan on Twitter saying I feel like parts of his lyrics can also be applied to the Palestinian struggle people as someone who grew up in a country where I always got silenced when I talked about what horrors Israel put Palestinians through and you know she goes on and on she at the end really says that what what stood out to her right here she says to know someone with a voice as powerful as his is addressing those same problems and hardships and maybe tying bridges to her experience is really powerful to her what was that trip like to you on that trip was life-changing it was a year ago I spent 11 days I went with a group called dream defenders I went with a delegation of artists and I was very grateful I was the only indigenous person but um you know I was aware that said their colonialism was happening out there but when I was actually in Palestine for 11 days it was very I will say spiritually triggering because I I saw almost sometimes almost like line 4 line what happened to my ancestors from like open-air prison systems our reservations basically - setting the government setting up laws to make our lives living hell and make us want to leave and so you know I'm definitely gonna write a song about for Palestine one day and the thing that just keeps coming to my head was I looked in the eyes of Palestine and I saw my own reflection you know I saw the reflection of my people and what we went through and and it really shook me to my core in a way I haven't yet found the words to describe but I know it's going to come out and in music so I love what you're saying there and it it explains why you've been called this take a look at my screen here Frank Wallace the bridge is the sound of an indigenous generation rising Frank ron has been making moves he's built a large and devoted audience of fans and he's been dubbed the Bob Marley of the Lakota for the way that he envisions music as a force for love struggle healing and social change so that's one person's perspective there but I like that they're talking about the things that are in your music the love the struggle the healing and the social change I read an it in an interview that you were about 21 when you started this journey came into music and you did it because you said it was an act of survival so that seems to resonate throughout your lyrics talk to us about that feeling that music is your means of survival yeah well you know growing up on in the place where I grew up on the Rosewood reservation um it wasn't an easy place to grow up it's one of the poorest counties in this country I was raised by a single mom and you know there were a lot of beautiful things there our culture and you know we're reviving our language and there's a lot of things at home I can't get anywhere else in the world but because of colonialism and genocide there's a lot of things there that can actually kill me too so you know whenever I'm talking about music as an act of survival it started when I was 7 I started playing piano when I was and I've struggled away from anxiety depression and suicide for most of my life and I think a lot of native people feel the same way even if we're not aware of it or don't talk about it and music at a certain point in my life was the only thing that made me feel like I wanted to be alive you know so I think my spirit was just trying to trying to keep me alive and trying to keep me going and music was one of those things like you know people ask me why and I say like I it's like an itch I have to scratch I was born to make music I was born to do this I was born to see what she just seen me do and my life would be a waste if I weren't fulfilling my purpose you know it kind of goes back to that teaching I said if you know something you do it without being asked and I know I'm born to make music and it took me a while to realize that I can do that because I didn't believe in myself I didn't have the tools I didn't have the resources and it was kind of like just pouring myself into the work out of survival led me to where I'm at and then people started following him before I knew it I had a career behind and it seems like Frank more people are following you henryka on YouTube who's watching live said yes I am sold this is great thank you so much but we also have a more substantive comment from Megan saying Frank you're an extremely proud Lakota man have you ever personally struggled with American culture telling you you to feel self-hatred or even ashamed of your culture I mean I don't think like explicitly no one's ever told me that but all you got to do is look at the media and how like the type of media I grew up worth of portraying native people it was things like Disney's Peter Pan you know it was whenever I saw his on the news it was really only poverty porn you know they were only come in and cherry-pick the the negative stories and never talk about the history of why things are the way they are on our reservations and never show the hopeful side it was just become this all Native Americans are lazy or alcoholic or drug addicts you know we're deadbeat dads all these statistics so I think you know looking looking at the way the media has treated my people looking at historically the way this country and Americans have treated my people for over five hundred years they've been telling us they feel shame about who we are and to like not be Native actually yeah you know Frankie you mentioned your older generations language and I'll give our viewers a little bit of a fun fact trivia for this next album that's coming out he actually had to learn the the language and used an app to help you along with it right yeah so I'm not fluent so I didn't grow up speaking my language cuz it in my family it kind of went away with my great-grandparents when they passed on so I feel like if I learn my language and use my my path in my art as the vehicle I can maybe heal some of those wounds my great-grandma and great-grandpa had I don't I don't know what they took to their grave you know but I know if I can help in any way bring our language back I can I can heal that and I really believe that through our indigenous people our anybody we have the ability of time travel you can heal past present and future of that so you're gonna get a little taste Frank is going to play us out with a song in the Lakota language called wine are we to chaga for our audience who doesn't speak Lakota this is what the song roughly translates to I have it on my screen here Nation people now we thrive and prosper when your spirit speaks listen thoroughly the fire is coming back to life help each other we've been watching the stream with indigenous hip-hop artist Frank Wong Frank take it away
