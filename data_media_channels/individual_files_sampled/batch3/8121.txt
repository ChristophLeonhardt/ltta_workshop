Get E *TRADE. ALL OF OUR ALLIES ARE INCREASING THE DEFENSE BUDGETS. DO YOU GIVE ME CREDIT? YOUR LEADERSHIP HAS HAD A GREAT IMPACT. Neil: THE NATO SECRETARY GENERAL THANKING PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT GERMANY NEEDS TO DO MORE. ANYWAY, IN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE MEETING THE PRESIDENT, I'M HAPPY TO INTRODUCE SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG. THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. Neil: HOW DID IT GO WITH THE PRESIDENT TODAY? A GREAT MEETING. THE MAIN FOCUS WAS ON DEFENSE SPENDING AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT ALL OF OUR ALLIES MEET THEIR PLEDGES OR DO WHAT THEY PROMISE TO DO. WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME REAL PROGRESS. ALL OUR ALLIES HAVE STARTED TO INCREASE DEFENSE SPENDING AND MORE AND MORE ALLIES MEET THE NATO TARGET OF 2% OF GDP ON DEFENSE. SO WE'RE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION BUT STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. Neil: I NOTICED THAT GERMANY WAS SINGLED OUT BY THE PRESIDENT OF NOT SHARING OR DOING ITS SHARE. HE DIDN'T MENTION FRANCE, BUT IT WAS NOT I DON'T BELIEF THEY WERE AT THE 2% LEVEL. WHAT DO YOU DO IN THAT CASE? WELL WHAT WE DO, WE ARE WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR ALLIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IMPLEMENT TO DO WHAT WE PROMISED. WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. GERMANY HAS ALSO STARTED TO INCREASE DEFENSE SPENDING. LAST YEAR THEY INCREASED DEFENSE BUDGETS BY AROUND 6% IN REAL TERMS. AND NOT ONLY ARE MORE ALLIES CONTRIBUTING MORE TO DEFENSE BUDGETS, TO THE FUNDING, BUT ALSO WITH TROOPS AND FOR INSTANCE, NATO MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN, OUR PRESENCE IN IRAQ AND MORE NATO PRESENCE IN THE EASTERN ALLIANCE. GERMANY IS ALSO CONTRIBUTING IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. OUR ALLIES ARE DOING MORE BUT EXPECT THEM TO STEP FURTHER UP. Neil: GIVEN THE DEFENSE SPENDING, EVERY COUNTRY HAS DONE MORE THAN IT WAS DOING A YEAR OR CERTAINLY TWO YEARS AGO, IT DOES RAISE CONCERNS WHETHER NATO IS PREPARING FOR SOMETHING. IS IT? WE ARE RESPONDING TO A MORE UN U UNPREDICTABLE UNPREDICTABL UN PEDICTABL UN PREICTABL UN PREDITABL UN PREDICTBL UN PREDICTAB UN PREDICTABLE UN PREDICTABL UNPRREDICTABL UNPREDDICTABL UNPREDICCTABL UNPREDICTAABL UNPREDICTABLL UNPREDICTABLE UNPREDICTABLE S UNPREDICTABLE SEC UNPREDICTABLE SECUR UNPREDICTABLE SECURIT UNPREDICTABLE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT. THERE'S RUSSIAN, IRAQ AND SYRIA. BOTH SPENDING AND DOING MORE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM. AND I COMMEND PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND ITS CLEARLY HAVING AN IMPACT BECAUSE ALL OF OURS ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE DON'T WANT A NEW COLD WAR. WE DON'T WANT A NEW ARMS RACE. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE WHAT WE CALL A DUEL TRACK APPROACH TO RUSSIA. DETERRENCE HAS TO BE FIRM AND STRONG AND AT THE SAME TIME, WORK FOR A POLITICAL DIALOGUE TO IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA. Neil: IF I COULD TOUCH ON THE NORTH KOREAN TALKS COMING UP NEXT MONTH, GENERAL. THE PRESIDENT INTIMATED THAT MAYBE A REASON FOR THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER'S ABOUT FACE OR TOUGHER POSTURE IS BECAUSE HE MET WITH THE CHINESE LEADER AND IT WAS SORT OF REIGNED IN A LITTLE BIT. DO YOU BUY THAT? MY MAIN MESSAGE TODAY IS THAT ALL NATO ALLIES, NATO SUPPORTS THE EFFORTS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS IN NORTH KOREA. WE ALSO HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT. HAVING SAID THAT, IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP UP THE PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA. THE DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE, THE POLITICAL PRESSURE AND THE ECONOMIC PRESSURE. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REACH A SOLUTION THAT LEADS TO THE COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA AND ALSO THE NORTH KOREA STOP DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND STOP DEVELOPING THEIR BALLISTIC MISSILES. Neil: I GUESS THERE'S DIFFERENCE DEFINITIONS OF DENUCLEARIZATION. IF IT LOOKS LIKE THE TWO SIDES ARE FAR APART ON THAT ISSUE, THE PRESIDENT HAS INDICATED THAT HE WOULD JUST WALK AWAY FROM THE TALKS. WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF THAT, IF HE DID? I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING NOW IS TO BE FOCUSED AND SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF FIND A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION. WE HOPE IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE A SUMMIT AND HAVE A MEANINGFUL SUMMIT WITH SOME REAL OUTCOME. TO ACHIEVE THAT, WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA. SO THEREFORE, NATO SUPPORTS BOTH THE INITIATIVE TO HAVE A SUMMIT, TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH NORTH KOREA AND AT THE SAME TIME TO MAINTAIN THE PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA. I THINK IT WOULD BE WRONG TO SPECULATE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE DON'T SUCCEED. THE MAIN FOCUS SHOULD BE ON A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT WITH REAL PROGRESS AND REAL OUTCOME. Neil: I MENTIONED THIS, THIS WAS A 180 ON THE NORTH KOREANS, GOING WITH THE RELEASE OF HOSTAGES, THE COMMITTEE TO DECREASE NUCLEAR ACTIVITY AND NOW THIS. I'M WONDERING SOMEONE WHO HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF THIS, DO YOU TRUST THE NORTH KOREANS? I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE AWARE OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE. THEY HAVE NOT DELIVERED WHAT THEY PROMISED. I'M CERTAIN THAT ANY DEAL NEEDS TO HAVE MECHANISMS FOR RATIFICATION AND CONTROL. IT'S A BIT EARLY NOW TO GO INTO THE DETAILS OF A POTENTIAL DEAL. THE IMPORTANT THING FOR ME AND SECRETARY GENERAL NATO IS TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO HAVE A SUMMIT, TO MAKE PROGRESS AND THEN TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL. A DEAL NEEDS MECHANISMS FOR RATIFICATION FOR CONTROL. TO MAKE SURE THAT NORTH KOREA IS DELIVERING WHAT THEY PROMISE. SIR, YOU'VE BEEN VERY PATIENT. ONE QUESTION ON VLADIMIR PUTIN AND HOW QUIET HE'S BEEN. HE HASN'T SAID OR DONE MUCH SINCE HE WAS INAUGURATED FOR THE FIRST TIME. DOES HIS SILENCE WORRY YOU? WHAT WE'VE SEEN THE LAST YEAR IS A MORE ASSERTIVE RUSSIA, A RUSSIA THAT HAS INVESTED IN NEW AND MORE MODERN MILITARY CAPABILITIES, WHICH HAS INCREASED ITS MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, SYRIA. ALSO IN RUSSIA WHICH HAS BEEN WILLING TO USE MILITARY FORCE AGAINST NEIGHBORS. UKRAINE, CRIMEA. THAT IS THE REASON WHY NATO IS IMPLEMENTING THE BIGGEST REINFORCEMENT SINCE THE COLD WAR. NATO IS INCREASING THE PRESENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO ANY POTENTIAL ADVERSARY, IF ONE ALLY IS ATTACKED, IT WILL TRIGGER A RESPONSE FROM THE WHOLE ALLIANCE. THIS IS WHAT WE CALL DETERRENCE. THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT THE WAR
