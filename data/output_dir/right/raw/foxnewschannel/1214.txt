WE KNOW AT LEAST THE FIRST THREE

00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:05,436
ARE.

4
00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:08,373
ELIZABETH: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

5
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:08,773
DISTURBING.

6
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:09,107
LELAND.

7
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:11,609
LELAND: TODAY MARKS PRESIDENT

8
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:12,577

UNEMPLOYMENT.

13
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:19,050
ISSUES THAT GENERALLY PUSH

14
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,351
VOTERS TO THE POLLS.

15
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:21,052
SPEAKING OF POLLS RIGHT NOW.

16
00:00:21,052 --> 00:00:24,656
VOTERS NATIONWIDE WERE

17
00:00:24,656 --> 00:00:25,990
INFINITELY MORE TOWARDS

18
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,691
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS THE

19
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:28,860
GENERIC CONGRESSIONAL VOTE.

20
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,961
AS YOU CAN SEE, IT HAS TAKEN

21
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:31,329
SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE

22
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,899
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

23
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,334
FIVE STATES HAVE PRIMARIES ON

24
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:36,668

IOWA RADIO HOST STEVE DAYS.

28
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:46,210
NICE TO SEE BOTH OF YOU.

29
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,478
RIGHT NOW YOU'VE GOT THE

30
00:00:47,478 --> 00:00:49,180
ECONOMIC ARGUMENT COMING OUT OF

31
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,914
THE WHITE HOUSE.

32
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:50,648
THE FOREIGN-POLICY ARGUMENT OUT

33
00:00:50,648 --> 00:00:52,750
OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEN THE

34
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,585
PRESIDENT ATTORNEYS GOING ON

35
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:56,521
OFFENSE AGAINST THE MOLAR

36
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:56,955
INVESTIGATION.

37
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:58,790
TAKE A LISTEN TO RUDY GIULIANI

38
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,860
LATER TODAY -- EARLIER TODAY.

39
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,494
>> THIS IS THE WHAT THE

40
00:01:03,494 --> 00:01:06,965
PRESIDENT TESTIFIED.

41
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:07,732
OUR RECOLLECTION KEEPS CHANGING

42
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:09,534
HER WERE NOT EVEN ASKED THE

43
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:12,737
QUESTION SO NOBODY MAKES AN

44
00:01:12,737 --> 00:01:13,137
ASSUMPTION.

45
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:13,905
IN MY CASE I MADE AN ASSUMPTION

46
00:01:13,905 --> 00:01:15,206
WE CORRECTED AND GOT IT RIGHT

47
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:17,976
OUT AS SOON AS IT HAPPENED.

48
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:20,979
>> STEVE, WE HAVE SEEN THE WHITE

49
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:22,313
HOUSE AND ITS OUTSIDE COUNSEL

50
00:01:22,313 --> 00:01:23,047
REALLY TURN UP THE HEAT ON THE

51
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:26,551
MOLAR INVESTIGATION.

52
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:27,952
IS THAT GALVANIZE REPUBLICANS TO

53
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:28,686
TALK TO OR DOES IT SLIP THEM A

54
00:01:28,686 --> 00:01:31,289
LITTLE BIT?

55
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:32,790
>> I THINK RIGHT NOW ALMOST

56
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,361
EVERYTHING HAS THE OPTION OF

57
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:38,196
EITHER GALVANIZING YOUR BASE

58
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:38,930
AND/OR GALVANIZING THE OTHER AT

59
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,765
THE EXACT SAME TIME.

60
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:44,402
WE HAVE A MOTTO ON MY SHOW,

61
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:45,103
WHOEVER LOSES BECAUSE WE HAVE

62
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:48,539
GOT THIS FASCINATING, THIS

63
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,375
CONTRASTS WITH THE TYPICAL

64
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,076
ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT DRIVE THE

65
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:52,844
ELECTORATE ARE IN FAVOR OF TRUMP

66
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:54,912
AND THE REPUBLICANS.

67
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:56,848
ON THE OTHER HAND, HIS APPROVAL

68
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:57,615
RATING IS STILL VERY MUCH IN THE

69
00:01:57,615 --> 00:02:00,218
DANGER ZONE.

70
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:01,586
THE ENERGY LEVEL AS WE'VE SEEN

71
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:02,387
IN ELECTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

72
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:04,389
IS STILL VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF

73
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:07,291
DEMOCRATS AND THOSE USUALLY

74
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:07,992
PORTEND THE OUTCOME OF MIDTERM

75
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,594
ELECTIONS AS WELL.

76
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:10,328
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE EVER

77
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:12,230
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE

78
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,032
TYPICALLY THE REASON WHY THE

79
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:16,634
OTHER SIDE IS ENERGIZED IS

80
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:18,202
BECAUSE YOUR POLICIES ARE NOT

81
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:18,636
POPULAR.

82
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:19,370
IN THIS CASE, TRUMP'S POLICIES

83
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,974
ARE FAR MORE POPULAR THAN HE IS.

84
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:24,042
IT WOULD BE FASCINATING TO SEE

85
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:27,178
THE VOTERS SORT THIS OUT COME

86
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:27,612
NOVEMBER.

87
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:28,346
>> TWITTER WILL SORT OUT WHICH

88
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:30,314
ONE OF THE THREE OF US WAS

89
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:30,615
CLASS.

90
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:32,850
WE WILL TUNE IN FOR THAT.

91
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,618
WE WOULD GET YOU TO RESPOND TO

92
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:36,687
STEVE IN THE SENSE THAT

93
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:37,355
DEMOCRATS NOW HAVE TO CHANGE

94
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:40,124
THEIR PLAYBOOK.

95
00:02:40,124 --> 00:02:40,925
EVEN DEMOCRATS WHO COME ON THE

96
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,927
SHOW AND MUCH MORE ABOUT

97
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:43,961
ATTACKING HIM IN GOING AFTER HIM

98
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:48,466
ON RUSSIA.

99
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:49,767
>> WELL, I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT'S

100
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:50,501
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO DO.

101
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:53,471
THEY HAVE TO DO MORE THAN NOT.

102
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:55,273
THEY CAN JUST BE WE ARE NOT

103
00:02:55,273 --> 00:02:55,907
SHOWN, PARTY OF TRUMP ARE

104
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:57,675
DIFFERENT FROM TRUMP BECAUSE

105
00:02:57,675 --> 00:02:59,577
WE'VE SEEN IN SOME DISTRICTS IN

106
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:00,278
ELECTIONS WHERE THERE'VE BEEN

107
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:01,579
SUCCESSFUL IN FLIPPING IT WHERE

108
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,714
THERE HAS BEEN A MORE MODERATE

109
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:06,617
TONE WITH REGARD TO THE

110
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:06,984
PRESIDENT.

111
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:09,353
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE

112
00:03:09,353 --> 00:03:09,787
CONSTITUENCY.

113
00:03:09,787 --> 00:03:10,521
WE HAD 10 DISTRICTS RIGHT HERE

114
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:12,090
IN THIS STATE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

115
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,561
ARE VERY FOOTBALL BOWL TO BLUE

116
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:17,261
FOR BREAD.

117
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:17,929
THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC OF

118
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:21,299
CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT AND QUITE

119
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,700
FRANKLY IF DEMOCRATS OFTEN SOME

120
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,301
OF THOSE ISSUES AND THE

121
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:26,304
DEMOGRAPHICS THAT ARE VERY

122
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:27,038
IMPORTANT LIKE IMMIGRATION,

123
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:27,805
WALLS THAT THEY DON'T WANT BUILT

124
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:31,008
IN A LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS AND

125
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:31,709
SEPARATION OF CHILDREN FROM

126
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,544
FAMILIES AND THE LACK OF

127
00:03:33,544 --> 00:03:35,279
IMMIGRATION POLICY.

128
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,915
ALSO THE ISSUE OF GUN CONTROL

129
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:38,950
AND A LACK OF THOSE ISSUES THAT

130
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,819
MAY GET DEMOCRATS OUT TO VOTE.

131
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,523
AS A DEMOCRAT, WE ARE GREAT AT

132
00:03:45,523 --> 00:03:46,491
MARCHING AND WE HAVE ALL THESE

133
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:48,359
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE REGISTERING

134
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,128
TO VOTE AND THAT IS AWESOME AND

135
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:51,496
MANY ARE REGISTERING AS

136
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:51,863
DEMOCRATS.

137
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:54,198
OR SO INDEPENDENCE.

138
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:56,667
IF THEY DON'T VOTE, IT DOESN'T

139
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:57,435
HELP ANYBODY FLIPPING A DISTRICT

140
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:59,137
EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

141
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:01,339
>> I THINK IT WAS ON THE WEST

142
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:02,039
WING DAYSIDE DECIDED BY THOSE

143
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,510
WHO SHOW UP.

144
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,944
STEVE, TO YOU NOW, THIS IS

145
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:08,679
SOMETHING SPLITTING THE

146
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:12,016
REPUBLICAN PARTY, ESPECIALLY IN

147
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:12,316
IOWA.

148
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:14,318
HE SHOULD PRESIDENT TRUMP

149
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:14,652
STARES.

150
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:15,319
LARRY KUDLOW ON "FOX NEWS

151
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,454
SUNDAY" IN THEM WILL GET YOUR

152
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:17,889
REACTION.

153
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,791
>> I DON'T DENY THAT.

154
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,261
YOU COULD JEOPARDIZE THAT.

155
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:26,797
>> AS POSSIBLE, ABSOLUTELY.

156
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:27,431
>> THE ECONOMY IS ON FIRE.

157
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:30,301
UNEMPLOYMENT THREE-POINT LEAD.

158
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:31,035
DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE SHOW WE

159
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:36,807
SAY X DOES REPUBLICAN BASE ON

160
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:37,208
TARIFFS?

161
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,610
>> I THINK HE DEFINITELY DOES.

162
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,511
HE'S GOT AN EXPOSED FLANK WITH

163
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:42,647
EVERYDAY AMERICANS.

164
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:44,815
WHEN YOU GET INTO TARIFFS OVER

165
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:46,751
HERE IN SUBSIDIES OVER THERE,

166
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,353
YOU START GROUPS AGAINST ONE

167
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:50,421
ANOTHER AND DEMOCRATS ARE FAR

168
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:51,756
BETTER AT THAT THAN REPUBLICANS

169
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:52,023
ARE.

170
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:54,859
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

171
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:55,560
I'M IN A GROCERY STORE HERE

172
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,894
RECENTLY GOING THROUGH THE

173
00:04:56,894 --> 00:04:58,996
EXPRESS LANE AND THE WOMAN AHEAD

174
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:00,097
TO ME WANTS TO KNOW WHY HER

175
00:05:00,097 --> 00:05:02,633
CARTON OF EGGS OR $3 WHEN THEY

176
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:03,668
WERE MUCH CHEAPER A FEW MONTHS

177
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:03,935
AGO.

178
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:06,470
WE KNOW THE ANSWER.

179
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,238
IT IS A TRADE WAR, THE THREAT OF

180
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:10,174
TERRORISTS COME AT HENRY.

181
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:11,609
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE NEARLY

182
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:12,677
THE UNREST IN THE MIDDLE EAST

183
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:15,079
FROM MOVING THE EMBASSY TO

JERUSALEM.

185
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:17,715
RELATIVELY SPEAKING WE HAVE AS

186
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:18,416
MUCH CONSISTENT PIECE IN THE

187
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:22,620
MIDDLE EAST AS WE'VE HAD

188
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:22,987
POST-9/11.

189
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:23,888

192
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:31,429
PASSED AWAY NOT.

193
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:32,563
WHY ARE THE OF EGGS MORE AT THE

194
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:32,863
STORE.

195
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:36,367
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THEY DON'T

196
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:39,370
GET INTO COMPLEX ECONOMIC AREAS

197
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,137
AND BATTLING TALKING POINTS.

198
00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:42,640
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THIS

199
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,107
FOR ME.

200
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:43,841
RIGHT NOW A LOT OF GOOD THINGS

201
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,544
FOR THE TRUMP ECONOMY FOR THEM.

202
00:05:46,544 --> 00:05:47,478
WHEN YOU WERE TO RAZORS THAT OF

203
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:49,880
MARGINS COME YOU DON'T HAVE TO

204
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,848
ALIENATE A LOT OF PEOPLE TO

205
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:51,582
CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THE

206
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:54,785
ELECTORATE COME NOVEMBER.

207
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:55,720
LELAND: I ONLY HAVE 15 SECONDS

208
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,354
BUT I WANT TO GET YOU IN.

209
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:59,156
HOW DO DEMOCRATS EXPLOIT THE

210
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:01,359
VIEW WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT?

211
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,093
>> I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH STEVE

212
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:04,228
ON THIS ONE BECAUSE IT'S NOT

213
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:04,729
JUST THE ECONOMY.

214
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,099
IT'S THE PERCEPTION OF A PERSON

215
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:11,102
ECONOMIC SITUATION THAT IS THE

216
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:11,435
REALITY.

217
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:12,503
THEY ARE GOING TO THE PUMPS AND

218
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:13,004
PRICES ARE HIGHER.

219
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:16,207
THE WAGE GROWTH IS NOT THE,

220
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:17,508
WHICH WE HAVE NOT SEEN.

221
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:18,409
WE SAW DURING THE OBAMA YEARS

222
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:22,046
UNEMPLOYMENT DROPPED OVER AND

223
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:22,780
OVER IN ELECTIONS.

224
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,749
SO IT'S REALLY THE FEELING OF

225
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:26,450
PERCEPTION ECONOMICALLY AT THE

226
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,321
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THEY GO TO

227
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:30,688
VOTE.

228
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:31,622
>> PERHAPS AS STEVE POINTS OUT

229
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:32,356
HOW THEY FEEL AT THE PUMP IN THE

230
00:06:32,356 --> 00:00:00,000
GROCERY STORE WAY, WAY OUT WAY
