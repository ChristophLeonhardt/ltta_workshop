1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,790
On Aug. 4,

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,870
Venezuelan President
Nicolás Maduro

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,990
was apparently the target
of an assassination attempt.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,710
Maduro was giving a speech,
here, in front of troops.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,200
Then something
exploded in midair,

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,330
probably less than the
length of a football field

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,130
away from the president.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,900
A second explosion
happened 14 seconds later,

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,440
two blocks away.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,850
The day ended in mayhem
and mass confusion.

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,960
And it’s still unclear
who launched the attack.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,520
But by reconstructing
the events,

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,770
we can get a
clearer look

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,280
at how it unfolded.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,030
Hundreds of soldiers

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,820
take formation on historic
Avenida Bolívar in Caracas.

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,430
Maduro is hosting a ceremony
honoring the National Guard.

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,810
It’s a demonstration
of strength

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,200
for his dictatorship,
broadcast live on state TV.

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,450
About an hour into the event,

21
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,900
Maduro and others nervously
notice something above them.

22
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,370
Two minutes later, something
suddenly interrupts him.

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,440
The state broadcast
cuts to a soldier,

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,380
but the same
scene was captured

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,810
by a different camera.

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,620
In this clip,

27
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,260
you can hear an
explosion and see

28
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,440
Maduro’s bodyguards
running to protect him.

29
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,100
Around this area,

30
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,070
cellphone video captured a
drone exploding in midair —

31
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,930
above the military parade,
and within Maduro’s sightlines.

32
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,390
Two blocks away,
another drone is seen.

33
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,975
It flies into an apartment
building and crashes.

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,400
It detonates 14 seconds
after the first explosion.

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,200
The sound can be heard
at the ceremony grounds,

36
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,950
and it sends
the crowd fleeing.

37
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,780
You can see a hole on the
wall where the drone exploded.

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,300
We analyzed the
images of both drones.

39
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,040
They are DJI M600
commercial drones.

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,370
Each costs about $5,000.

41
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,780
They can carry up
to 13 pounds

42
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,280
in a three-mile radius.

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,120
Here we see a likely camera
and explosives attached.

44
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,270
According to the
Venezuelan authorities,

45
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,480
the drones carried C-4
plastic explosives.

46
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,630
These are commonly used by
military and law enforcement.

47
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,770
They’re moldable and
usually triggered remotely.

48
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,810
Seven soldiers were
injured by the explosion

49
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,380
at the parade.

50
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,720
In the aftermath 
of the incident,

51
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,690
authorities arrested
six people

52
00:02:58,690 --> 00:00:00,000
and started to crack down
on opposition lawmakers.
